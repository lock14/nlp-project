00:00:29,227 --> 00:00:31,429
- I STILL HAVE TO DO TOUCH-UPS
ON SYLVIA.

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,499
- WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME FOR?

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,100
WHERE THE HELL IS SYLVIA?

00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:52,316

HOW NOW, BROWN COW.

00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:53,551
- HEY, DALE?

11
00:00:53,552 --> 00:00:54,952
- YEAH, YEAH.
HOW'S IT GOING, JOSH?

12
00:00:54,953 --> 00:00:56,119
- IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,388
LOOK, DALE,
SYLVIA SEEMS TO BE M.I.A.

14
00:00:58,389 --> 00:01:00,424
- WELL,
THAT'S NOT VERY PROFESSIONAL.

15
00:01:00,425 --> 00:01:01,492
- NO, NO, IT'S NOT.

16
00:01:01,493 --> 00:01:03,360
- DAMN UNPROFESSIONAL,
IF YOU ASK ME.

17
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:04,428
- AND I AGREE.

18
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:05,563
ANY IDEA WHERE SHE MAY BE?

19
00:01:05,564 --> 00:01:07,865
- NOW, HOW WOULD I KNOW THAT,
JOSH, HMM?

20
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:12,269
I'M NOT MY WEATHER GIRL'S
KEEPER, RIGHT?

21
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,705
RIGHT?

22
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:32,490

WE'RE ON IN ABOUT 25 SECONDS,

YOU AND SHE ARE CLOSE.

SO IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE SHE MAY BE...

25
00:01:35,927 --> 00:01:41,431
- JOSH, MY PERSONAL LIFE
IS MY BUSINESS.

26
00:01:41,432 --> 00:01:44,167
ARE WE CLEAR ON THAT?

IT'S ROMANTIC, DALE.

113
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:46,984

THE INFANTILE

115
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:52,189
THAT'S RIGHT, LADIES.
HE'S GRABBY.

117
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,325

FOR A PLETHORA OF REASONS,

118
00:04:55,326 --> 00:04:58,295
NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH BEING
I AM 35, SINGLE,

119
00:04:58,296 --> 00:05:01,131
AND, UM, YEAH,
OCCASIONALLY LONELY,

120
00:05:01,132 --> 00:05:03,266
I GAVE IN TO HIS ADVANCES.

121
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:06,269
AND WE HAD SEVERAL, YOU KNOW,

122
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,709
WHAT COULD ONLY BE DESCRIBED
AS DISAPPOINTING ENCOUNTERS.

123
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,610
SORRY.

124
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:15,946
BUT DESPITE THE AMATEURISH SEX,

125
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:18,248
I SOMEHOW DEVELOPED
AN ATTACHMENT

126
00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:20,383
TO THE WALKING HAIRCUT
SITTING IN THAT CHAIR.

127
00:05:20,384 --> 00:05:21,785

128
00:05:21,786 --> 00:05:28,025

STAGNANT, PASSIONLESS LIFE.

129
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:29,693

130
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:31,195
GEORGE, HELP ME.

131
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:32,529
CUT THE LIGHTING!
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

132
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,031
DO NOT CUT ANYTHING.
THIS IS GOOD TV.

133
00:05:34,032 --> 00:05:35,565

134
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:37,868

135
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:40,437
WHEN AFTER DALE HAD ALREADY
LEFT FOR THE STUDIO,

136

THIS IS IT.

140

BUT BEFORE I GO,

148
00:06:10,068 --> 00:06:13,370

TO ALL OF YOU OUT THERE,

149
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:16,373
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,
READ A NEWSPAPER.

150
00:06:16,374 --> 00:06:17,574
THIS IS NOT NEWS.

151
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:18,575

152
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:21,478

155
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:25,749

WHAT DID YOU DO IN HERE?
IT'S--

180
00:07:18,336 --> 00:07:19,402
- YOU WANT ME TO KICK HIS ASS?

181
00:07:19,403 --> 00:07:20,737
- YES.
- REALLY?

182
00:07:20,738 --> 00:07:23,273
- NO, IT'S--
PLEASE, NO, DON'T KICK HIS ASS.

183
00:07:23,274 --> 00:07:25,242
- ALL RIGHT,
I DON'T THINK I COULD ANYWAY.

184
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:26,343
YOU WANT A DRINK?

185
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:28,846
- IT'S 9:00 IN THE MORNING.

186
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:29,847
YES.

187
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:32,115
OH.

188
00:07:32,116 --> 00:07:33,717
GOD, OH, WAIT,
CAN I HAVE A BLOODY MARY?

189
00:07:33,718 --> 00:07:37,387
- YEAH, LET ME WHIP THAT UP
FOR YOU.

190
00:07:37,388 --> 00:07:41,458
I'M GOING TO ENJOY
AN APPLE MARTINI.

191
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:43,060
YOU LOOK LIKE SHIT.

192
00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:46,563
OH, THAT'S GOOD.

193
00:07:46,564 --> 00:07:47,564
- THANK YOU.

194
00:07:47,565 --> 00:07:48,565
- NO, I'M SERIOUS.

195
00:07:48,566 --> 00:07:49,699
YOU--YOU LOOK LIKE SHIT.

196
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,301
THIS IS, LIKE,
YOU LOOK REALLY, REALLY--

197
00:07:51,302 --> 00:07:53,203
THIS IS, LIKE, THE WORST
I'VE EVER SEEN YOU LOOK.

198
00:07:53,204 --> 00:07:54,804
- OKAY, IS THIS SUPPOSED
TO BE HELPING ME?

199
00:07:54,805 --> 00:07:56,974
- SYL, I'M YOUR BROTHER,
AND I'M REALLY VERY FOND OF YOU,

200
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:58,008
BUT I CANNOT BE OKAY

201
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:59,343
WITH YOU BEING
THIS MUCH OF A WRECK

202
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:01,311
OVER THAT DOUCHE BAG
FROM THE MORNING SHOW.

203
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:02,980
- HEY, CAN I HAVE, LIKE,
FIVE MINUTES HERE?

204
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:03,981
I'M KIND OF UPSET.

205
00:08:03,982 --> 00:08:04,982
- I'M TRYING TO HELP.

206
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:06,383
- WELL, YOU CAN HELP
BY SHUTTING UP.

207
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:07,885
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

208
00:08:07,886 --> 00:08:09,186
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

209
00:08:09,187 --> 00:08:11,088
IF YOU WANT TO GET ALL UPSET
OVER SOME STUPID DUDE

210
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:13,056
WHO I NEVER LIKED,
THEN GO NUTS.

211
00:08:13,057 --> 00:08:14,992
- I AM WELL AWARE
OF YOUR OPINION, THANK YOU.

212
00:08:14,993 --> 00:08:16,659
- OH, WELL, THEN I GUESS
I DON'T HAVE TO SAY,

213
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,694
"I TOLD YOU SO"

214
00:08:17,695 --> 00:08:19,429
BECAUSE I ALREADY DID,
LIKE, 50 TIMES.

215
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,630
I MEAN, THIS GUY'S AN IDIOT,

216
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:22,299
AND MY BIG SISTER'S A WRECK
BECAUSE OF HIM.

217
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,300
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

218
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:24,401
- GOD, YOU ARE SUCH AN IDIOT.

219
00:08:24,402 --> 00:08:26,036
OKAY, IT'S NOT JUST HIM.

220
00:08:26,037 --> 00:08:27,871
IT'S EVERYTHING.

221
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:29,206
TWO YEARS, WE WERE TOGETHER.

222
00:08:29,207 --> 00:08:30,507
OKAY, TWO YEARS.

223
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:32,042
WE--WE LIVED TOGETHER.

224
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:33,710
WE BOUGHT FURNITURE TOGETHER.

225
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:35,812
WE TALKED ABOUT KIDS' NAMES.

226
00:08:35,813 --> 00:08:36,846
AND WHERE AM I NOW?

227
00:08:36,847 --> 00:08:37,847
I--

228
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:38,982
I'M 35 YEARS OLD.

229
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:41,285
I HAVE NO JOB,
NO INSURANCE,

230
00:08:41,286 --> 00:08:42,352
NO APARTMENT,

231
00:08:42,353 --> 00:08:43,954
$1,500 IN A SAVINGS ACCOUNT,

232
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:46,656
A CAR THAT I COULDN'T AFFORD
PAYMENTS ON WHEN I WAS EMPLOYED,

233
00:08:46,657 --> 00:08:47,857
AND, UM, WHAT ELSE DON'T I HAVE?

234
00:08:47,858 --> 00:08:49,259
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
I DON'T HAVE?

235
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,094
I DON'T HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

236
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:52,562
- TELL ME ABOUT
THIS SAVINGS ACCOUNT.

237
00:08:52,563 --> 00:08:54,197
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

238
00:08:54,198 --> 00:08:55,399
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO?

239
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,968
IT'S LIKE I'M STARTING
ALL OVER AGAIN.

240
00:08:57,969 --> 00:08:59,169
OH, MY GOD.

241
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,438
I HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN.

242
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,640
OH, GOD,
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.

243
00:09:03,641 --> 00:09:04,741
WHY DIDN'T I STICK AROUND?

244
00:09:04,742 --> 00:09:07,811
I COULD HAVE HUNG AROUND
AND GOTTEN A JOB

245
00:09:07,812 --> 00:09:09,779
OR LOOKED FOR AN APARTMENT
OR SOMETHING.

246
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,081
- YEAH, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

247
00:09:11,082 --> 00:09:12,849
JUST HANG OUT AND PRETEND
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW

248
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,684
DALE'S DOING HIS COHOST,
A MUCH BETTER OPTION.

249
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:15,986
- I'M JUST TRYING
TO BE RATIONAL.

250
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:18,422
- GOD, YOU'RE SO FULL OF SHIT.

251
00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:20,723
LET ME JUST SHARE WITH YOU
ONE OF YOUR QUALITIES.

252
00:09:20,724 --> 00:09:21,724
ALL RIGHT?

253
00:09:21,725 --> 00:09:22,892
YOU COULDN'T BE RATIONAL

254
00:09:22,893 --> 00:09:24,928
AT THE COST OF YOUR PRIDE
FOR ANYTHING.

255
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:26,396
YOU DID JUST
WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE

256
00:09:26,397 --> 00:09:28,698
AND ALSO CONVENIENTLY
WHAT YOU HAD TO DO

257
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:30,567
BECAUSE OF YOUR LOVE
OF CONFLICT.

258
00:09:30,568 --> 00:09:32,469
- I DON'T LOVE CONFLICT.

259
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,071
- IT'S YOUR CRACK.

260
00:09:34,072 --> 00:09:35,072
NOW, SHUT UP.

261
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:36,073
YOU'RE GOING TO STAY HERE.

262
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:37,207
YOU'RE GOING TO GET A JOB,

263
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,042
AND EVERYTHING'S
GOING TO BE OKAY, OKAY?

264
00:09:39,043 --> 00:09:40,210
- YOU THINK SO?

265
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:41,445
- YEAH, WHY NOT?

266
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:42,980
- OKAY.

267
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:44,581
- WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD
CUT HIS BALLS OFF.

268
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:45,815
- CAN YOU SAY THAT
ANY LOUDER?

269
00:09:45,816 --> 00:09:46,816
- OH, I'M SORRY.

270
00:09:46,817 --> 00:09:48,051
AM I EMBARRASSING YOU?

271
00:09:48,052 --> 00:09:49,719
I WAS TRYING TO BE SUPPORTIVE
OF MY FRIEND.

272
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
- ARE YOU SAYING I'M NOT?

273
00:09:50,721 --> 00:09:51,721
- I'M SAYING THAT MAYBE

274
00:09:51,722 --> 00:09:53,190
MAKING PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE
COMMENTS

275
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:55,058
AND TRYING TO UNDERMINE ME
LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO

276
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:56,759
IS NOT THE BEST WAY
TO HELP SYLVIA.

277
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
- I UNDERMINE YOU?

278
00:09:57,761 --> 00:09:58,928
WHEN HAVE I EVER UNDERMINE--

279
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:00,330
- I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M HERE.

280
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:01,764
I DON'T FEEL
LIKE BEING OUT TONIGHT.

281
00:10:01,765 --> 00:10:02,765
WHY DID I GO OUT TONIGHT?

282
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:03,933
I SHOULD BE AT HOME.

283
00:10:03,934 --> 00:10:05,535
I SHOULD BE AT HOME,
SITTING ON THE COUCH,

284
00:10:05,536 --> 00:10:08,238
EATING ICE CREAM, AND WATCHING
OLD MOVIES OR SOMETHING.

285
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:10,240
- WHAT YOU NEED IS A COCKTAIL
AND YOUR GIRLFRIENDS.

286
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:11,241
- YES.

287
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:12,275
- HEY, WEATHER GIRL.
- HI.

288
00:10:12,276 --> 00:10:14,511
- DALE IS SUCH AN ASSHOLE.

289
00:10:14,512 --> 00:10:16,446
YOU GO, GIRL.

290
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,050
- WHO SAYS, "YOU GO, GIRL"?

291
00:10:21,051 --> 00:10:23,019
- OKAY, YEAH, NO,
I NEED ANOTHER DRINK.

292
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,354
- HONEY, LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

293
00:10:24,355 --> 00:10:25,755
I AM SO PROUD
OF WHAT YOU DID TODAY.

294
00:10:25,756 --> 00:10:26,856
- YEAH, ME TOO.

295
00:10:26,857 --> 00:10:28,425
- YOU DID EXACTLY
WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE.

296
00:10:28,426 --> 00:10:29,459
- ME TOO.

297
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,893
- GAVE IT TO HIM
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.

298
00:10:30,894 --> 00:10:32,295
- AND THE BITCH.
- THE MOUSY BITCH.

299
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:34,731
- THERE IS NO WAY THAT FRAIL
LITTLE BITCH IS GOOD IN BED.

300
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:36,600
NO WAY.

301
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:37,601
- WELL, THANKS, YOU GUYS.

302
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:38,602
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T PLAN IT.

303
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:41,638
IT JUST SORT OF--
BLAH, HAPPENED.

304
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,573
- SO WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO NOW, LOVE?

305
00:10:43,574 --> 00:10:45,475
- UH, SEND OUT MY RESUME,
I GUESS.

306
00:10:45,476 --> 00:10:48,911
- OH, A WEATHER GIRL RESUME?

307
00:10:48,912 --> 00:10:50,313
WHAT?
SHE'S A WEATHER GIRL.

308
00:10:50,314 --> 00:10:52,148
- I'M A BROADCAST JOURNALIST,
JANE.

309
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:54,217
- JESUS, JANE,
SHE'S A BROADCAST JOURNALIST.

310
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:55,485
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

311
00:10:55,486 --> 00:10:56,753
- I MADE A MISTAKE.

312
00:10:56,754 --> 00:10:58,655
- LOOK, THERE ARE FOUR OTHER
LOCAL NEWS STATIONS

313
00:10:58,656 --> 00:10:59,689
WITH MORNING, AFTERNOON,

314
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,124
AND NIGHTTIME NEWS PROGRAMS,
RIGHT?

315
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,293
SO THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING
OUT THERE, I THINK.

316
00:11:03,294 --> 00:11:04,861
- MM.
- MM-HMM.

317
00:11:04,862 --> 00:11:05,862
- OH, INCOMING.

318
00:11:05,863 --> 00:11:07,163
- HI.
- HI.

319
00:11:07,164 --> 00:11:08,732
- EXCUSE ME FOR INTERRUPTING.

320
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:12,068
MY FRIENDS AND I OVER THERE,
WE HAD A BET.

321
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:13,270
ARE YOU THAT CHICK

322
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:16,640
THAT TOTALLY LOST HER SHIT
ON THAT NEWS GUY?

323
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:40,330
[bottle fizzes]

324
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:43,433
- [gasps]

325
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:45,802
JESUS CHRIST.

326
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:48,070
- NO, BYRON, ACTUALLY.

327
00:11:48,071 --> 00:11:50,139
- WHO ARE YOU?

328
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,941
- I'M BYRON.

329
00:11:51,942 --> 00:11:54,577
- AND WHY ARE YOU HERE?

330
00:11:54,578 --> 00:11:57,980
- I'M A FRIEND OF WALT'S.

331
00:11:57,981 --> 00:11:59,716
- WHAT?

332
00:11:59,717 --> 00:12:03,019
WHA-WHA-WHAT IS THAT?

333
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,355
- OH, THAT'S YOU, ACTUALLY.

334
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:06,623
- WHAT AM I...

335
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:08,257
WHAT AM I DOING
ON THE COMPUTER?

336
00:12:08,258 --> 00:12:10,627
- UH, YOU'RE FREAKING OUT.

337
00:12:10,628 --> 00:12:12,796
HERE, IT'S ACTUALLY
MY FAVORITE PART.

338
00:12:12,797 --> 00:12:14,664
- BUT DESPITE
THE AMATEURISH SEX,

339
00:12:14,665 --> 00:12:16,299
I SOMEHOW DEVELOPED
AN ATTACHMENT

340
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,101
TO THE WALKING HAIRCUT
SITTING IN THAT CHAIR.

341
00:12:19,102 --> 00:12:20,136
- [chuckles]

342
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:21,771
I'M SORRY.

343
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:24,507
I LOVE IT WHEN YOU CALL HIM
A HAIRCUT.

344
00:12:24,508 --> 00:12:26,275
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

345
00:12:26,276 --> 00:12:28,411
- WHY--WHY AM I ON THERE?

346
00:12:28,412 --> 00:12:30,112
- YOU'RE EVERYWHERE.

347
00:12:30,113 --> 00:12:31,348
YOU'RE ON A BUNCH
OF FILM SITES.

348
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:32,449
I MEAN, JUST ALONE TODAY

349
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,883
I'VE GOTTEN TEN EMAILS
FROM PEOPLE,

350
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:36,018
AND ONLY ONE OF THEM
WAS FROM WALT.

351
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:38,087
- WAIT, WALT SENT THIS TO YOU?

352

00:18:04,815 --> 00:18:05,815
- I'M SORRY.

531
00:18:05,816 --> 00:18:06,983
- I JUST WOKE UP HERE.
- I KNOW.

532
00:18:06,984 --> 00:18:08,084
- AND YOU'RE FREAKING ME OUT.

533
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:09,085
- DIDN'T MEAN TO.

534
00:18:09,086 --> 00:18:10,153
- WELL, YOU DID.

535
00:18:10,154 --> 00:18:11,620
- YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE REALLY ATTRACTIVE

536
00:18:11,621 --> 00:18:13,156
WHEN YOU GET ALL RILED UP.

537
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:15,525
- WILL YOU STOP
FLIRTING WITH ME?

538
00:18:15,526 --> 00:18:18,394
- OKAY, BUT YOU MIGHT WANT
TO PUT SOME PANTS ON,

539
00:18:18,395 --> 00:18:20,530
BECAUSE I CAN'T BE HELD
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT I'M SAYING

540
00:18:20,531 --> 00:18:21,931
WHEN YOU'RE NOT WEARING
ANY PANTS.

541
00:18:21,932 --> 00:18:23,165
IT'S JUST DISTRACTING.

542
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,467
- GOD.

543
00:18:24,468 --> 00:18:27,269
- THE KNEESOCKS, THOUGH,
I LOVE IT.

544
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:32,542
- OKAY.

545
00:18:32,543 --> 00:18:35,879
SITUATION: NOT GOOD.

546
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,981
YOU NEED TO FIX THIS
IMMEDIATELY.

547
00:18:37,982 --> 00:18:41,651
YOU ARE A SMART, CAPABLE WOMAN.

548
00:18:41,652 --> 00:18:44,487
AND WHAT YOU NEED--
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED?

549
00:18:44,488 --> 00:18:45,889
YOU NEED TO MAKE A LIST.

550
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,456
YOU NEED TO MAKE
A LIST OF PRIORITIES

551
00:18:47,457 --> 00:18:52,629
ON HOW TO GET YOUR LIFE
TOGETHER.

552
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,497
YOU CAN DO THIS.

553
00:18:54,498 --> 00:18:56,032
YOU ARE STRONG.

554
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:57,500
YOU NEED SOMETHING
TO WRITE ON.

555
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,573
OKAY, I NEED SOME POST-IT NOTES.

556
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:07,710
WHAT?

557
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:09,512
WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

558
00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:10,780
DO I HAVE SOMETHING
ON MY FACE?

559
00:19:10,781 --> 00:19:13,249
- SIS, ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH A DEVICE CALLED A DVR?

560
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,250
- THIS ISN'T A GOOD IDEA.

561
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:15,451
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
LIKE, TIVO?

562
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:16,586
- TIVO.

563
00:19:16,587 --> 00:19:17,921
- I WOULD BACK OFF.
SHE'S FRAGILE.

564
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:19,321
- WE CAN DIGITALLY RECORD
A PROGRAM

565
00:19:19,322 --> 00:19:20,957
AND THEN WATCH IT
AT OUR CONVENIENCE.

566
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,793
<i>NOW, I'VE DONE EXACTLY THAT
WITH TODAY'S SEATTLE MORNING.</i>

567
00:19:23,794 --> 00:19:25,662
- WHY?
- FALLOUT.

568
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:27,530
- WE THOUGHT THERE MIGHT
BE SOME FALLOUT.

569
00:19:27,531 --> 00:19:29,666
- YEAH, I KNOW.

570
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,067
- YOU MAY WANT TO SIT DOWN HERE.

571
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:32,435
- OH, MY GOD.
- BYRON.

572
00:19:32,436 --> 00:19:34,136
- NO, NO-NO-NO.
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.

573
00:19:34,137 --> 00:19:35,438
- YOU MUST.

574
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:37,373
- GO, BYRON, GO.

575
00:19:39,877 --> 00:19:42,045
- AND NOW I FEEL
WE OWE OUR VIEWERS AN APOLOGY.

576
00:19:42,046 --> 00:19:44,380
- WELL, I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT,
DALE.

577
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:46,515
<i>- YESTERDAY, ONE OF OUR
SEATTLE MORNING TEAM MEMBERS</i>

578
00:19:46,516 --> 00:19:48,918
HAD A BIT OF A, WELL,

579
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:50,386
I GUESS YOU COULD CALL IT
AN EPISODE.

580
00:19:50,387 --> 00:19:52,021
- AN EPISODE.
SHE DID.

581
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:54,991
- OH, I DON'T LIKE HER AT ALL.

582
00:19:54,992 --> 00:19:56,358
- SHE MADE A SPECTACLE
OF HERSELF.

583
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,627
SHE TALKED ABOUT THINGS

584
00:19:57,628 --> 00:19:59,562
THAT ARE A BIT OF A NO-NO
ON MORNING TELEVISION,

585
00:19:59,563 --> 00:20:01,263
AND SHE USED SOME
TERRIBLE LANGUAGE.

586
00:20:01,264 --> 00:20:03,299
- WELL, WE HAVE KIDS WATCHING.

587
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,734
- IT'S A MORNING SHOW.

588
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,735
FAMILIES WATCH US.

589
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:07,536
THEY TRUST US.

590
00:20:07,537 --> 00:20:08,638
WE LET THEM DOWN.

591
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:09,639
- WE SURE DID.

592
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,940
- OH, STOP IT.
- SORRY.

593
00:20:10,941 --> 00:20:12,942
- SHE ALSO MADE SOME PRETTY
TERRIBLE ACCUSATIONS

594
00:20:12,943 --> 00:20:13,943
AGAINST YOU, DALE.

595
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:15,544
- AH, YEAH, SHE DID.
SHE DID.

596
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:17,213
IT'S TRUE,
BUT I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

597
00:20:17,214 --> 00:20:18,715
THOSE KIDS OUT THERE,

598
00:20:18,716 --> 00:20:20,583
THEY CAN'T TAKE CARE
OF THEMSELVES YET,

599
00:20:20,584 --> 00:20:22,085
AND THAT'S WHERE WE
FAILED THEM.

600
00:20:22,086 --> 00:20:23,385
- OH, MY GOD.

601
00:20:23,386 --> 00:20:25,154
- I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE
AND DEFEND MYSELF,

602
00:20:25,155 --> 00:20:28,124
MY MANHOOD,
AGAINST SOMEONE WHO...

603
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,258
- AND HERE HE GOES.

604
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:31,127
- TO SAY THE LEAST,
IS FRANKLY UNSTABLE.

605
00:20:31,128 --> 00:20:33,630
- I WOULD SAY THAT.
I WOULD SAY THAT.

606
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:34,931
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

607
00:20:34,932 --> 00:20:36,733
<i>I THINK THAT I SPEAK
FOR ALL OF SEATTLE MORNING</i>

608
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:39,401
WHEN I SAY,
GOOD FOR YOU, DALE.

609
00:20:39,402 --> 00:20:40,870
GOOD FOR YOU.

610
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:44,306
- THANKS, SHERRY.

611
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:47,476
YOU OUT THERE,
OUR FRIENDS,

612
00:20:47,477 --> 00:20:49,178
OUR NEIGHBORS,

613
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:51,213
WE'RE SORRY, SEATTLE.

614
00:20:51,214 --> 00:20:54,583
WE HOPE THAT WE HAVEN'T
LOST YOUR TRUST.

615
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:55,584
- OH, SEATTLE.

616
00:20:55,585 --> 00:20:58,054
- THE END.

617
00:20:58,055 --> 00:21:01,057

00:21:01,058 --> 00:21:06,029
¶¶ ¶¶

619
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,030
- THINK HE'S HOME?

620
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:08,131
- OH, I KNOW HE'S HOME.

621
00:21:08,132 --> 00:21:09,465
IT'S TIME FOR
HIS AFTER-SHOW NAP.

622
00:21:09,466 --> 00:21:11,801
- OKAY, YOUR SISTER
IS SO HOT.

623
00:21:11,802 --> 00:21:13,069
- DUDE.

624
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:22,845
THIS PLACE IS GAY.

625
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:23,846
UP AND AT 'EM, DICKHEAD.

626
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:25,014
- OH, MY GOD!

627
00:21:25,015 --> 00:21:26,049
- WHOA, WHOA, SYLVIA.

628
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,050
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

629
00:21:27,051 --> 00:21:28,250
- WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?

630
00:21:28,251 --> 00:21:29,952
- OH, YOU GUYS ARE ALREADY
NAPPING TOGETHER.

631
00:21:29,953 --> 00:21:30,953
THAT IS SO PRECIOUS.

632
00:21:30,954 --> 00:21:31,954
- HI, ASSHOLE.

633
00:21:31,955 --> 00:21:33,622
- WOW,
THIS IS A GREAT APARTMENT.

634
00:21:33,623 --> 00:21:34,924
- OH, IT'S NOT AN APARTMENT.

635
00:21:34,925 --> 00:21:36,092
IT'S A CONDO.

636
00:21:36,093 --> 00:21:37,493
- OH, MY GOD.
THEY'RE GONNA KILL US.

637
00:21:37,494 --> 00:21:38,661
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

638
00:21:38,662 --> 00:21:40,296
WE'RE ALL PART
OF AN ELITE HIT SQUAD.

639
00:21:40,297 --> 00:21:41,630

SYLVIA'S BROTHER.

640
00:21:41,631 --> 00:21:42,631
REMEMBER ME?

641
00:21:42,632 --> 00:21:43,700
WE'VE MET MAYBE TEN TIMES.

642
00:21:43,701 --> 00:21:44,701
- YEAH, I DO.

643
00:21:44,702 --> 00:21:45,702
HI, WALT.
HOW ARE YOU?

644
00:21:45,703 --> 00:21:46,903
- HUH.
- I WANT MY THINGS, DALE.

645
00:21:46,904 --> 00:21:47,904
AND I'M GONNA TAKE THEM.

646
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:49,305
- YOU CAN TAKE YOUR CLOTHES,
SYLVIA,

647
00:21:49,306 --> 00:21:51,574
BUT I WON'T
BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.

648
00:21:51,575 --> 00:21:53,342
- OH.
- HMM.

649
00:21:53,343 --> 00:21:54,944
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

650
00:21:54,945 --> 00:21:56,645
- THAT PROBABLY WASN'T
VERY SMART, DALE.

651
00:21:56,646 --> 00:21:58,647
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF?

652
00:21:58,648 --> 00:22:00,049
- BADLY WORDED, REALLY.
- EXACTLY.

653
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,718
- YOU SON OF A BITCH.

654
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:02,752
- OH, SHIT!
- [screams]

655
00:22:02,753 --> 00:22:05,054
- TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF?

656
00:22:05,055 --> 00:22:06,555
- SHE'S CRAZY!

657
00:22:06,556 --> 00:22:08,224
- STOP INTERRUPTING, SHERRY.

658
00:22:08,225 --> 00:22:10,559
STOP TALKING.
I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU.

659
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,862
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN SLEEPING
AROUND BEHIND MY BACK, DALE?

660
00:22:12,863 --> 00:22:14,263
- THAT'S PRETTY COOL, ACTUALLY.

661
00:22:14,264 --> 00:22:16,565
- HOW MUCH OF A FOOL
DID I LOOK LIKE FOR YOU?

662
00:22:16,566 --> 00:22:18,701
YOU THINK THAT I'M FUCKING
TAKING ADVANTAGE?

663
00:22:18,702 --> 00:22:21,838
- HANDS OFF THE ANCHORPEOPLE.

664
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:23,372
BE NICE.
PLAY NICE. PLAY NICE.

665
00:22:23,373 --> 00:22:24,540
- WHAT'S UP?

666
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:26,943
- I AM TAKING EVERYTHING
I EVER SPENT A PENNY ON

667
00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:27,944
OUT OF THIS APARTMENT.

668
00:22:27,945 --> 00:22:29,045
IF YOU TRY TO STOP ME,

669
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:30,646
I SWEAR TO GOD,
I WILL CLAW YOUR EYES OUT.

670
00:22:30,647 --> 00:22:31,848
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

671
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:33,950
EVERY SINGLE THING.

672
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:47,063
- WHAT?
THIS IS IT?

673
00:22:47,064 --> 00:22:48,064
- THIS IS ALL YOUR STUFF.

674
00:22:48,065 --> 00:22:50,867
- I THOUGHT I HAD MORE STUFF.

675
00:22:50,868 --> 00:22:52,468
- IT'S KIND OF A HOLLOW VICTORY,
ISN'T IT?

676
00:22:52,469 --> 00:22:53,770
- OKAY, SHUT UP, WALT,
ALL RIGHT?

677
00:22:53,771 --> 00:22:55,371
CAN WE GO, PLEASE?

678
00:22:55,372 --> 00:22:57,606
- SYLVIA.

679
00:22:57,607 --> 00:23:00,276
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

680
00:23:00,277 --> 00:23:01,878
YOU JUST TRIED TO KILL ME
IN THERE.

681
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:05,414
THE LEAST YOU COULD DO
IS TALK TO ME FOR A MINUTE.

682
00:23:08,152 --> 00:23:09,752
- GO AHEAD, YOU GUYS.

683
00:23:09,753 --> 00:23:11,487
GO.

684
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:13,156
GO.

685
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:14,157
- ALL RIGHT.

686
00:23:14,158 --> 00:23:15,158
[grunts]

687
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:17,693
ON THE KNEES.

688
00:23:21,598 --> 00:23:22,631
- WHAT?

689
00:23:22,632 --> 00:23:23,766
- THIS IS NOT ALL MY FAULT.

690
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:24,801
- OH, PLEASE.

691
00:23:24,802 --> 00:23:26,235
- NO, "OH, PLEASE" YOU,
SYLVIA.

692
00:23:26,236 --> 00:23:27,837
"OH, PLEASE" YOU.

693
00:23:27,838 --> 00:23:29,939
OKAY.

694
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,307
I MADE LOVE
TO ANOTHER WOMAN.

695
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:34,010
I BROKE THE RULES.

696
00:23:34,011 --> 00:23:38,447
SORRY.

697
00:23:38,448 --> 00:23:40,850
BUT YOU PUSHED ME TO IT.

698
00:23:40,851 --> 00:23:42,285
- I PUSHED YOU TO IT?

699
00:23:42,286 --> 00:23:44,320
HOW DID--
HOW DID I DO THAT?

700
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:46,422
- YOU NEVER LOVED ME.

701
00:23:46,423 --> 00:23:47,556
YOU NEVER LET ME IN.

702
00:23:47,557 --> 00:23:50,326
YOU NEVER RESPECTED ME.

703
00:23:50,327 --> 00:23:51,493
I WAS OKAY FOR A TIME,

704
00:23:51,494 --> 00:23:53,562
BUT YOU NEVER STOOPED SO LOW

705
00:23:53,563 --> 00:23:58,267
AS TO REALLY ALLOW YOURSELF
TO HAVE FEELINGS FOR ME.

706
00:23:58,268 --> 00:24:00,903
I'M FLESH AND BLOOD, SYLVIA.

707
00:24:00,904 --> 00:24:05,141
I WANT SOMEONE TO WANT ME
AS MUCH AS I WANT THEM.

708
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:07,243
YOU'RE COLD,

709
00:24:07,244 --> 00:24:10,379
SYLVIA.

710
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,481
YOU ARE COLD.

711
00:24:12,482 --> 00:24:15,718
AND THAT'S WHY I DID
WHAT I DID.

712
00:24:23,193 --> 00:24:25,361
- SAID HE ONLY SLEPT WITH HER
BECAUSE I DIDN'T LOVE HIM,

713
00:24:25,362 --> 00:24:27,263
AND HE SAID THAT
I WAS COLD.

714
00:24:27,264 --> 00:24:30,066
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

715
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:31,467
GUYS?

716
00:24:31,468 --> 00:24:33,635
I MEAN, ISN'T THAT THE CRAZIEST
THING YOU'VE EVER HEARD?

717
00:24:33,636 --> 00:24:35,204
THAT I'M COLD?

718
00:24:35,205 --> 00:24:37,639
- WELL...

719
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,075
- OH, MY GOD.

720
00:24:39,076 --> 00:24:41,077
- YOU DO SOMETIMES
HAVE A LITTLE TROUBLE

721
00:24:41,078 --> 00:24:42,811
LETTING PEOPLE IN.

722
00:24:42,812 --> 00:24:44,347
- I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU REALLY LOVED HIM.

723
00:24:44,348 --> 00:24:45,948
- OH, MY GOD.
ME NEITHER.

724
00:24:45,949 --> 00:24:47,583
- I DON'T THINK SHE'S BEEN
IN LOVE SINCE I'VE KNOWN HER.

725
00:24:47,584 --> 00:24:48,717
- WHAT ABOUT THE LAWYER?

726
00:24:48,718 --> 00:24:50,419
- YOU MEAN THE ONE SHE JUST
STOPPED CALLING?

727
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,653
- OH, RIGHT.

728
00:24:51,654 --> 00:24:53,222
- THAT GUY WAS THE MOST
BORING GUY ON THE PLANET.

729
00:24:53,223 --> 00:24:54,223
- BUT HE WAS A LAWYER.

730
00:24:54,224 --> 00:24:55,557
YOU COULD HAVE GIVEN HIM
A CHANCE.

731
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:56,658
- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

732
00:24:56,659 --> 00:24:58,294
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT I'M COLD?

733
00:24:58,295 --> 00:24:59,762
- NO.
- NO.

734
00:24:59,763 --> 00:25:02,398
- HONEY, NO.
YOU--YOU JUST--

735
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:03,900
- MAYBE IT'S JUST DIFFICULT

736
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:06,135
FOR YOU TO THINK
OF LOVING SOMEONE.

737
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:07,603
- YOU'VE GOT WALLS.
- YOU DO.

738
00:25:07,604 --> 00:25:10,139
OH, OH, MY GOD.
BRAINSTORM. CHARLES.

739
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,440
both: CHARLES.

740
00:25:11,441 --> 00:25:12,608
- OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S SO CRAZY.

741
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:13,876
IT JUST MIGHT WORK.

742
00:25:13,877 --> 00:25:16,012
- SYLVIA, HE IS PERFECT FOR YOU,
PRACTICALLY PERFECT.

743
00:25:16,013 --> 00:25:17,813
HE IS VERY NICE.

744
00:25:17,814 --> 00:25:19,515
- YEAH, I DON'T THINK
THAT I'M READY TO DATE.

745
00:25:19,516 --> 00:25:20,783
- HE WORKS OUT AT OUR GYM.

746
00:25:20,784 --> 00:25:22,718
- YEAH, HE USED TO DATE MAUREEN.
- YOU KNOW MAUREEN.

747
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:23,886
- LOUD AND STUPID.
- BIG GIRL.

748
00:25:23,887 --> 00:25:25,087
- YEAH, BUT THEY'RE SO DONE NOW.

749
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:26,088
- YEAH.

750
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:27,189
- YOU GUYS ARE CRAZY.

751
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,792
I JUST BROKE UP WITH DALE,
LIKE, YESTERDAY.

752
00:25:29,793 --> 00:25:32,361
- OKAY, PERHAPS YOU THINK
YOU HAVE NOTHING BUT TIME.

753
00:25:32,362 --> 00:25:33,396
- YOU DON'T.

754
00:25:33,397 --> 00:25:34,430
- YOU DON'T, SYLVIA.

755
00:25:34,431 --> 00:25:36,032
YOU'RE IN YOUR LATE 30s.
- MID 30s.

756
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:37,733
- YOU HAVE A TINY WINDOW
REMAINING.

757
00:25:37,734 --> 00:25:39,101
- CHARLES IS AN ACCOUNTANT.

758
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:40,803
HE'S STABLE.

759
00:25:40,804 --> 00:25:43,906
HE'S NOT GAY,
AND HE'S NOT NOT ATTRACTIVE.

760
00:25:43,907 --> 00:25:45,141
- NOT NOT ATTRACTIVE.

761
00:25:45,142 --> 00:25:46,809
- THIS IS YOUR FUTURE
YOU'RE PLAYING WITH.

762
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,110
- YES, ALSO A PERFECT
OPPORTUNITY

763
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:49,645
TO WARM UP THAT COLD SHOULDER.

764
00:25:49,646 --> 00:25:51,547
- IT WOULDN'T HURT IF DALE
HEARD YOU WERE DATING.

765
00:25:51,548 --> 00:25:52,915
- NO, WOULDN'T HURT AT ALL.

766
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:54,984
LOOK, IF YOU WANT TO SPEND
YOUR FEW REMAINING MOMENTS

767
00:25:54,985 --> 00:25:57,486
AS AN ATTRACTIVE MIDDLE-AGED
WOMAN BEING PICKY, GO AHEAD.

768
00:25:57,487 --> 00:25:58,487
- MIDDLE-AGED?

769
00:25:58,488 --> 00:25:59,488
WE ARE THE SAME AGE.

770
00:25:59,489 --> 00:26:00,823
- YEAH, AND I'M MARRIED,

771
00:26:00,824 --> 00:26:02,825
AND JANE'S IN A SERIOUS
RELATIONSHIP WITH A FUTURE.

772
00:26:02,826 --> 00:26:05,161
AND WE BOTH HAVE CAREERS
AND IRA ACCOUNTS

773
00:26:05,162 --> 00:26:06,795
AND OUR OWN APARTMENTS.

774
00:26:06,796 --> 00:26:08,331
- AND I'M ACTUALLY ONLY 34.

775
00:26:08,332 --> 00:26:11,167
- OKAY, LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING IS
THAT WE'RE IN THE MAJOR LEAGUES,

776
00:26:11,168 --> 00:26:12,868
AND YOU JUST GOT KNOCKED BACK
TO THE MINORS.

777
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:13,970
- IS THAT A SPORTS REFERENCE?

778
00:26:13,971 --> 00:26:15,537
- I KNOW, RIGHT?
I JUST CAME UP WITH THAT.

779
00:26:15,538 --> 00:26:16,538
- LOOK AT THAT.

780
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:17,974
- OH, SHIT, I GOT TO GO
PICK UP MY KIDS.

781
00:26:17,975 --> 00:26:19,675
- OH, OH, GOD.
I'VE GOT PILATES.

782
00:26:19,676 --> 00:26:21,610
- UM, I WILL CALL CHARLES
AND GIVE HIM THE RUNDOWN.

783
00:26:21,611 --> 00:26:22,811
- I WILL EMAIL HIM YOUR PICTURE.

784
00:26:22,812 --> 00:26:25,047
SYLVIA, HE IS GONNA LOVE YOU,
REALLY.

785
00:26:25,048 --> 00:26:26,482
- DID YOU VALET?
- TOTALLY.

786
00:26:26,483 --> 00:26:27,483
- BYE, SYL.
- OKAY.

787
00:26:27,484 --> 00:26:28,484
- BYE.
- OKAY.

788
00:26:28,485 --> 00:26:31,854
- BE STRONG, BABY, YEAH?

789
00:26:31,855 --> 00:26:32,921
BYE, HONEY.

790
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:34,890
WAIT A SEC.
WAIT A SEC.

791
00:26:39,363 --> 00:26:42,898
[car horns honking]

792
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:44,867
- SO AS YOU CAN SEE
FROM MY RESUME,

793
00:26:44,868 --> 00:26:47,536
I'VE BEEN WORKING IN TELEVISION
SINCE GRADUATING COLLEGE.

794
00:26:47,537 --> 00:26:49,672
AND YOU KNOW, I'VE DONE
A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING

795
00:26:49,673 --> 00:26:54,377
FROM REPORTING TO COLOR STORIES,
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.

796
00:26:54,378 --> 00:26:57,880
WHY--WHY--WHY ARE YOU LOOKING
AT ME LIKE THAT?

797
00:26:57,881 --> 00:27:00,015
- YOU REALLY LOST IT ON
THAT MORNING SHOW, DIDN'T YOU?

798
00:27:00,016 --> 00:27:01,784
I MEAN, YOU FREAKED OUT.

799
00:27:01,785 --> 00:27:02,785
MY STAFF LOVES IT.

800
00:27:02,786 --> 00:27:04,286
WE WATCH IT ALL THE TIME.

801
00:27:04,287 --> 00:27:06,989
DALE WATERS, WHAT AN ASSHOLE.

802
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,391
- EVERYBODY
IN SEATTLE TELEVISION

803
00:27:08,392 --> 00:27:10,259
KNOWS DALE'S AN ASSHOLE.

804
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,360
HELL, I SLEPT WITH HIM ONCE

805
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:14,397
AFTER SOME LOCAL
JOURNALIST DINNER.

806
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:16,899
YOU WERE CERTAINLY RIGHT ABOUT
HIS DISAPPOINTING PERFORMANCE.

807
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,634
REAL HIGH SCHOOL STUFF.

808
00:27:18,635 --> 00:27:21,303
- ¶¶ ARGUE ABOUT THE THINGS ¶¶

809
00:27:21,304 --> 00:27:23,539
¶¶ I SHOULD HAVE LEFT BEHIND ¶¶

810
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:27,476
- HMM.

811
00:27:27,477 --> 00:27:28,778
- HEY, YEAH, TRACY,

812
00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:30,979
WHAT WAS IT THAT SASSY WEATHER
GIRL CALLED DALE WATERS?

813
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,980
- OH, GRABBY.

814
00:27:31,981 --> 00:27:33,382
- GRABBY.

815
00:27:33,383 --> 00:27:34,550
I BET HE IS.

816
00:27:34,551 --> 00:27:35,751
WHAT AN ASSHOLE.

817
00:27:35,752 --> 00:27:39,488
- ¶¶ DREAM UP MUDDY RIVER ¶¶

818
00:27:39,489 --> 00:27:43,492
¶¶ UNDERNEATH THE DROWSY MOON ¶¶

819
00:27:47,397 --> 00:27:49,832
- SO YOU BLEW
THE TELEVISION GIG,

820
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:52,635
AND NOW YOU WANT
TO GET INTO RADIO?

821
00:27:52,636 --> 00:27:55,504
- WELL, I HAVE AN OPEN MIND.

822
00:27:55,505 --> 00:27:59,374
- AH, ISN'T THAT BIG OF YOU.

823
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:01,677
- ¶¶ PAST GROCERY STORES ¶¶

824
00:28:01,678 --> 00:28:03,245
- I LOVE THAT YOU
RIPPED THAT GUY APART.

825
00:28:03,246 --> 00:28:04,346
I REALLY DO.

826
00:28:04,347 --> 00:28:06,248
DALE WATERS IS JUST SOUTH
OF RETARDED.

827
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:08,116
HERE'S THE PROBLEM.

828
00:28:08,117 --> 00:28:09,384
MY ANCHORS ARE ASSHOLES TOO,

829
00:28:09,385 --> 00:28:11,754
AND WHAT'S TO KEEP YOU
FROM RIPPING THEM APART?

830
00:28:11,755 --> 00:28:13,288
- YEAH.

831
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:15,591
- LOOK, I FEEL FOR YOU.

832
00:28:15,592 --> 00:28:17,960
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I CAN DO.

833
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:19,728
YOU'RE A JOKE.

834
00:28:19,729 --> 00:28:22,064
IF I PUT YOU ON MY STAFF,
THAT MAKES ME A JOKE.

835
00:28:22,065 --> 00:28:23,732
HEY, BILL.

836
00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:25,233
AND I'M NO JOKE.

837
00:28:25,234 --> 00:28:26,669
OKAY, GIVE ME THE NUMBERS.

838
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,704
- AH, OKAY.

844
00:28:49,058 --> 00:28:51,627
- OH, WALT, STOP IT.

845
00:28:51,628 --> 00:28:53,228
YOU'RE HURTING MY NECK.

846
00:28:53,229 --> 00:28:54,797
- SAY YOU SUCK.
SAY IT!

847
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:55,931
- YOU SUCK!

848
00:28:55,932 --> 00:28:56,932
NO!

849
00:28:56,933 --> 00:28:58,100
- HEY, KIDS.

850
00:28:58,101 --> 00:28:59,101
WHAT'S GOING ON?

851
00:28:59,102 --> 00:29:00,302
- LOOK, LOOK WHAT SHE DID.

852
00:29:00,303 --> 00:29:01,336
SHE MOVED MY BED OUT HERE.

853
00:29:01,337 --> 00:29:03,005
SHE'S TAKING MY ROOM.

854
00:29:03,006 --> 00:29:04,439
- YEAH, I KNOW.
I HELPED HER MOVE IT.

855
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,841
- YOU--YOU--YOU HELPED HER MOVE?

856
00:29:05,842 --> 00:29:07,510
WHY DOES SHE GET THE ROOM?

857
00:29:07,511 --> 00:29:08,611
- WALT, SHE'S A GIRL.

858
00:29:08,612 --> 00:29:09,712
- [muffled] I'M A GIRL.

859
00:29:09,713 --> 00:29:11,246
- YOU BROUGHT MY BEST FRIEND
INTO THIS?

860
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:12,280
YOU SUCK.
YOU BEST--

861
00:29:12,281 --> 00:29:13,749
- YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT.

862
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,350
I GAVE YOU BACK YOUR BED.

863
00:29:15,351 --> 00:29:16,919
- I LIVE HERE, OKAY?

864
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,054
YOU CAN'T JUST MOVE ALL
MY SHIT AROUND IN MY APARTMENT.

865
00:29:19,055 --> 00:29:20,288
- THIS IS A TEMPORARY SITUATION.

866
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:21,690
- IT DOESN'T MATTER, OKAY?

867
00:29:21,691 --> 00:29:22,958
I'M NOT A LITTLE KID ANYMORE.

868
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:24,259
YOU CAN'T PUSH ME AROUND.

869
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,995
- THIS IS A MUCH BETTER
ARRANGEMENT, WALT.

870
00:29:25,996 --> 00:29:27,062
- SAYS YOU.

871
00:29:27,063 --> 00:29:29,632
I HAVE GOT A SYSTEM HERE,
YOU KNOW?

872
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:31,667
- GOD, WE HAVE TO LIVE TOGETHER.

873
00:29:31,668 --> 00:29:34,269
- OKAY, THIS IS A TEMPORARY
SITUATION.

874
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,838
YOU SHOULD BE OUT
GETTING A FUCKING JOB,

875
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:37,439
NOT REARRANGING MY FURNITURE.

876
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,975
- I HAVE BEEN LOOKING
ALL WEEK LONG.

877
00:29:39,976 --> 00:29:44,413
- OH, YEAH.
HOW DID IT GO?

878
00:29:44,414 --> 00:29:45,681
WHAT?

879
00:29:45,682 --> 00:29:48,517
- WELL, IT WAS AWFUL, BYRON,
ACTUALLY.

880
00:29:48,518 --> 00:29:51,386
EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO LOOKS
AT ME SEES WEATHER GIRL.

881
00:29:51,387 --> 00:29:52,655
EVERYBODY'S CALLING ME SASSY,

882
00:29:52,656 --> 00:29:54,423
AND I SWEAR TO GOD,
IF ONE MORE PERSON DOES IT,

883
00:29:54,424 --> 00:29:56,124
I'M GONNA FUCKING LOSE IT.

884
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:57,793
I-I-LOOKIT.
I AM TRYING, OKAY?

885
00:29:57,794 --> 00:29:59,962
I DON'T LIKE CROWDING YOUR LIFE
ANY MORE THAN YOU DO.

886
00:29:59,963 --> 00:30:01,630
- WELL, YOU GOT TO TRY HARDER.

887
00:30:01,631 --> 00:30:03,799
- REALLY?
OH, OKAY, THANK YOU, WALT.

888
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,333
- LOWER YOUR STANDARDS.

889
00:30:05,334 --> 00:30:06,735
IT'S A TOUGH JOB MARKET.

890
00:30:06,736 --> 00:30:07,803
- THAT'S TRUE.

891
00:30:07,804 --> 00:30:08,804
IT IS.

892
00:30:08,805 --> 00:30:10,039
- I HAVE A COLLEGE EDUCATION.

893
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,473
- JOIN THE CLUB.

894
00:30:11,474 --> 00:30:13,609
- I'VE HAD A COVETED TELEVISION
JOB IN A CLASS II MARKET.

895
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,010
- AND YOU LOST IT.

896
00:30:15,011 --> 00:30:16,612
- OH, MY GOD.
WHY ARE YOU BEING SUCH A DICK?

897
00:30:16,613 --> 00:30:18,313
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE ACTING LIKE
A SPOILED BRAT.

898
00:30:18,314 --> 00:30:19,615
I WENT TO COLLEGE TOO, SYL.

899
00:30:19,616 --> 00:30:20,849
YOU KNOW, I'M A TEMP.

900
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,651
BYRON HERE WENT TO GRAD SCHOOL,

901
00:30:22,652 --> 00:30:24,954
AND HE'S RENTING MY COMPUTER
TO BUILD WEBSITES.

902
00:30:24,955 --> 00:30:26,388
- PHILOSOPHY MAJOR.

903
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:29,458
- JUST GROW UP, SYL.
GROW UP.

904
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:30,759
THIS IS THE WORLD.

905
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,262
WE DON'T ALWAYS GET TO DO
WHAT WE WANT TO DO.

906
00:30:34,263 --> 00:30:36,465
- [scoffs]

907
00:30:38,534 --> 00:30:41,570
- OH, YEAH, JUST GO
AND HANG OUT IN MY ROOM.

908
00:30:41,571 --> 00:30:44,573
[acoustic guitar music]

909

¶¶ ¶¶

910
00:31:00,156 --> 00:31:02,257
- SO YOU DON'T HAVE
MUCH EXPERIENCE.

911
00:31:02,258 --> 00:31:03,592
- WELL, IN COLLEGE...

912
00:31:03,593 --> 00:31:06,729
- YEAH, WELL,
THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

913
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,898
- IT--YEAH,
IT'S LIKE RIDING A BIKE.

914
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:12,334
- NO, IT'S NOT.

915
00:31:12,335 --> 00:31:13,669
ALL RIGHT, SALLY.

916
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,771
I'M GONNA TAKE A CHANCE ON YOU.

917
00:31:15,772 --> 00:31:18,741
DON'T MAKE ME REGRET IT.

918
00:31:18,742 --> 00:31:20,475
- IT'S--SYLVIA.

919
00:31:20,476 --> 00:31:21,476
- WHAT?

920
00:31:21,477 --> 00:31:23,112
- MY NAME IS SYLVIA.

921
00:31:23,113 --> 00:31:25,380
- YEAH, WELL, WE DO
THE NAME TAG THING TOMORROW

922
00:31:25,381 --> 00:31:26,448
BEFORE YOUR SHIFT, OKAY?

923
00:31:26,449 --> 00:31:28,117
THERE'S AN ORDER TO THINGS.

924
00:31:28,118 --> 00:31:29,118
- [mouthing words]

925
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,152
- GOT A PROCESS HERE.

926
00:31:30,153 --> 00:31:32,721
ALL RIGHT.

927
00:31:32,722 --> 00:31:34,690
THIS IS YOUR APRON.

928
00:31:34,691 --> 00:31:37,826
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

929
00:31:37,827 --> 00:31:39,494
THIS IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

930
00:31:39,495 --> 00:31:42,464
IF YOU LOSE IT,
YOU HAVE TO BUY THE NEXT ONE.

931
00:31:42,465 --> 00:31:45,233
AND THEY'RE NOT CHEAP.

932
00:31:45,234 --> 00:31:46,234
TAKE IT.

933
00:31:46,235 --> 00:31:47,936
- OH, RIGHT.

934
00:31:47,937 --> 00:31:50,172
- OKAY, SHOW UP TOMORROW
WITH A WINE KEY

935
00:31:50,173 --> 00:31:51,273
AND NO LESS THAN FIVE PENS.

936
00:31:51,274 --> 00:31:53,108
I DO A STAFF CHECK FIRST THING,

937
00:31:53,109 --> 00:31:54,543
AND I SHIT YOU NEGATIVE.

938
00:31:54,544 --> 00:31:55,844
YOU SHOW UP
WITHOUT THAT WINE KEY

939
00:31:55,845 --> 00:31:58,847
AND LESS THAN FIVE PENS,

940
00:31:58,848 --> 00:32:01,850
AND I WILL SEND YOU HOME.

00:32:01,851 --> 00:32:05,420
OF THIS YOU CAN BE SURE.

942
00:32:05,421 --> 00:32:06,989
SIMPATICO?

943
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:07,990
- YES.

944
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:08,991
- ATTA GIRL.

945
00:32:08,992 --> 00:32:10,559
- HMM.

946
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,061
- YOU GET ME SOME MORE COFFEE.

947
00:32:14,831 --> 00:32:16,231
- HEY.

948
00:32:16,232 --> 00:32:18,167

951
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,341
LISTEN, CAN I BE A DICK?

952
00:32:26,342 --> 00:32:28,110
KIND OF GET INTO YOUR BUSINESS
FOR A SECOND?

953
00:32:28,111 --> 00:32:32,447
- YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
BROTHERS AND SISTERS, BYRON.

954
00:32:32,448 --> 00:32:34,449
- OKAY, YES, GRANTED,
I AM AN ONLY CHILD.

955
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,517
I KNOW NOTHING.

956
00:32:35,518 --> 00:32:36,685
- EXACTLY.

957
00:32:36,686 --> 00:32:38,153
- BUT AS AN ONLY CHILD,

958
00:32:38,154 --> 00:32:40,288
I'VE ALWAYS KIND OF ENVIED
THIS WHOLE SIBLING THING

959
00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:41,623
THAT YOU HAVE GOING ON,
YOU KNOW?

960
00:32:41,624 --> 00:32:43,892
THIS WHOLE SISTER THING'S
KIND OF COOL.

961
00:32:43,893 --> 00:32:45,894
SHE--
IT'S THIS WHOLE OTHER PERSON

962
00:32:45,895 --> 00:32:47,562
THAT KIND OF KNOWS
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU.

963
00:32:47,563 --> 00:32:48,997
SHE'S BEEN THERE
FOR ALL OF THESE

964
00:32:48,998 --> 00:32:50,933
REALLY IMPORTANT MOMENTS
IN YOUR LIFE,

965
00:32:50,934 --> 00:32:52,968
THESE REARING MOMENTS.

966
00:32:52,969 --> 00:32:56,805
AND YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT IT'S
A PRETTY IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP

967
00:32:56,806 --> 00:32:57,806
THAT--

968
00:32:57,807 --> 00:32:59,808
- BYRON.

969
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:01,343
- OKAY, LISTEN,

970
00:33:01,344 --> 00:33:03,045
I'M NOT QUESTIONING YOUR LOVE

971
00:33:03,046 --> 00:33:04,579
FOR YOUR SISTER HERE AT ALL,
OKAY?

972
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,248
I'M IN ABSOLUTE REVERENCE OF IT,

973
00:33:06,249 --> 00:33:11,653
BUT THE FACT IS, SHE'S A GIRL.

974
00:33:11,654 --> 00:33:18,526
NO, SHE'S A GIRL
THAT JUST GOT DUMPED, OKAY?

975
00:33:18,527 --> 00:33:23,866
MAYBE CUT HER A LITTLE SLACK.

976
00:33:23,867 --> 00:33:25,333
- SHUT UP, DUDE.

977
00:33:25,334 --> 00:33:27,669
- FAIR ENOUGH.

978
00:33:30,506 --> 00:33:31,940
- I THINK BYRON'S GOT
A THING FOR YOU.

979
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:33,075

980
00:33:33,076 --> 00:33:35,343
HE TOLD ME.

981
00:33:35,344 --> 00:33:36,444
- WHAT ARE YOU, UH,

982
00:33:36,445 --> 00:33:39,181
WHAT ARE YOU ALL DONE UP FOR?

983
00:33:39,182 --> 00:33:42,350
- WELL, I HAVE A DATE.

984
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:43,585
I GOT A JOB TODAY,

985
00:33:43,586 --> 00:33:46,454
AND YOU KNOW,
I THOUGHT I'D TREAT MYSELF.

986
00:33:46,455 --> 00:33:48,223
- TREAT YOURSELF?

987
00:33:48,224 --> 00:33:52,560
WHO ARE YOU GOING
TO TREAT YOURSELF WITH?

988
00:33:52,561 --> 00:33:55,630
- YOU'RE GONNA MAKE BYRON
JEALOUS.

989
00:33:55,631 --> 00:33:57,866
[knocking at door]

990
00:33:59,368 --> 00:34:00,535

1008
00:34:29,365 --> 00:34:31,266

00:34:34,437 --> 00:34:36,671

[sighing]

1015
00:34:43,546 --> 00:34:45,380
- IT'S, UH, NICE TO MEET YOU
TOO, SYLVIA.

1016
00:34:45,381 --> 00:34:48,851
WOW, YOU ARE JUST AS BEAUTIFUL

1019
00:34:52,155 --> 00:34:53,621
- LET'S GO.

1020
00:34:53,622 --> 00:34:55,523
- HEY, DON'T YOU GET FRESH
WITH HER, NOW.

1021
00:34:55,524 --> 00:34:57,926
NO MEANS NO, SUIT MAN.

1022
00:34:57,927 --> 00:35:00,028
- WHO WAS THAT GUY?

1023
00:35:00,029 --> 00:35:01,429
- HMM.

1024
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,365
FIRE ESCAPE?

1025
00:35:03,366 --> 00:35:05,334
- FIRE ESCAPE.

1026
00:35:05,335 --> 00:35:06,668
- I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THEM
UP THERE.

1027
00:35:06,669 --> 00:35:08,036
- OH, THAT'S OKAY.

1028
00:35:08,037 --> 00:35:09,938
MEN LIKE TO BUST EACH OTHERS'
BALLS ON OCCASION,

1029
00:35:09,939 --> 00:35:11,673
BUT YOU KNOW,
I CAN DISH IT OUT MYSELF.

1030
00:35:11,674 --> 00:35:12,674
- OH, I BET.

1031
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:15,344
- SO THIS IS ME.

1032
00:35:15,345 --> 00:35:17,246
SHE'S A BEAUTY, ISN'T SHE?

- CHARLES, CAN I JUST SAY
NICE RIDE?

1034
00:35:19,215 --> 00:35:21,683
CLASSY YET UNDERSTATED.

1035
00:35:21,684 --> 00:35:23,585
- WHAT'S THE GAS MILEAGE
ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

1036
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:24,920
I'M JUST CURIOUS
BECAUSE YOU KNOW

1037
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:26,755
THAT WE DO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY
TO THE PLANET.

1038
00:35:26,756 --> 00:35:27,956
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1039
00:35:27,957 --> 00:35:29,191
CUT HIM SOME SLACK, BYRON.

1040
00:35:29,192 --> 00:35:30,959
THAT THING'S A PUSSY MAGNET,
AM I RIGHT, HUH?

1041
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,528
- CAN WE GO, PLEASE?

1042
00:35:33,529 --> 00:35:34,997
- CHARLES, BUDDY,
AM I RIGHT?

1043
00:35:34,998 --> 00:35:36,531
THOSE SEATS HAVE SEEN
A LITTLE ACTION.

1044
00:35:36,532 --> 00:35:40,402
- HE'S BEING COY.
COME ON.

1045
00:35:40,403 --> 00:35:42,438
- OH, THERE IT IS.
- ALL RIGHT.

1046
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:45,474
- WHO LET THE DOG OUT?

1047
00:35:45,475 --> 00:35:48,110
- "WHO LET THE DOG OUT"?

1048
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,482
- SO IS IT WEIRD
TO BE A CELEBRITY?

1049
00:35:53,483 --> 00:35:56,552
- OH, I'M NOT REALLY
A CELEBRITY.

1050
00:35:56,553 --> 00:35:57,953
- YOU TOTALLY ARE.

1051
00:35:57,954 --> 00:36:01,856
I MEAN, LOOK, IT'S LIKE EVERYONE

1053
00:36:03,793 --> 00:36:05,894
GIVES ME GOOSE PIMPLES.

1054
00:36:05,895 --> 00:36:08,697
- OKAY.

1055
00:36:08,698 --> 00:36:11,900
- SO WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
TO DO NEXT?

1056
00:36:11,901 --> 00:36:12,934
TALK SHOW?

1057
00:36:12,935 --> 00:36:14,069
TALK SHOW.

1058
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,905
I BET YOU WOULD BE
GREAT IN THAT.

1059
00:36:16,906 --> 00:36:20,075
UM, UH, LIKE THE, UH,
LIKE THE--THE SALLY JESSY

1060
00:36:20,076 --> 00:36:22,344
BUT--BUT YOU KNOW, HOT.

1061
00:36:22,345 --> 00:36:23,345
[laughter]

1062
00:36:23,346 --> 00:36:24,846
- I DON'T KNOW.

1063
00:36:24,847 --> 00:36:30,586
YOU KNOW, I'M SORT OF EXPLORING
MY OPTIONS RIGHT NOW, I GUESS.

1064
00:36:30,587 --> 00:36:32,254
- CAN I BE HONEST WITH YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING?

1065
00:36:32,255 --> 00:36:35,157
- SURE.

1066
00:36:35,158 --> 00:36:38,560
- EMILY TOLD ME ABOUT
YOUR WALLS.

1067
00:36:38,561 --> 00:36:42,063
- M-M-MY WALLS?
WHAT?

1068
00:36:42,064 --> 00:36:45,066
- THE WALLS BUILT AROUND THIS.

1069
00:36:45,067 --> 00:36:47,202
RIGHT HERE.

1070
00:36:47,203 --> 00:36:48,937
WELL, WELL, GUESS WHAT?

1071
00:36:48,938 --> 00:36:50,972
GUESS WHAT, KID?

1072
00:36:50,973 --> 00:36:52,874
I'VE GOT THEM TOO.

1073
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:58,447
AND THEY ARE TALL
AND, YOU KNOW, MADE OF STONE.

1074
00:36:58,448 --> 00:37:03,118
BUT, UH, SINCE I MET YOU,
SYLVIA,

1075
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,686
YOU HAVE TORN DOWN MY WALLS.

1076
00:37:04,687 --> 00:37:06,588
- OH.
[stammers]

1077
00:37:06,589 --> 00:37:08,957
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

1078
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:10,025
- YOU KNOW, AND I THINK

1079
00:37:10,026 --> 00:37:12,994
I SEE THAT YOURS
ARE TUMBLING AS WELL.

1080
00:37:12,995 --> 00:37:14,563
AM I RIGHT?

1081
00:37:14,564 --> 00:37:15,964
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

1082
00:37:15,965 --> 00:37:18,033
LET'S JUST--LET'S JUST GET DOWN
TO BUSINESS, SYLVIA.

1083
00:37:18,034 --> 00:37:19,568
I WANT TO FAST-TRACK THIS THING.

1084
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:22,070
I WANT A FAMILY:

1085
00:37:22,071 --> 00:37:27,209
A WIFE, TWO KIDS,
A BOY AND A GIRL,

1086
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,578
LUCIUS AND ARIEL.

1087
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:34,716
I WANT TO SELL MY TOWNHOUSE
AND GET A REAL HOME,

1088
00:37:34,717 --> 00:37:39,221
A HOME WITH A WOMAN'S TOUCH.

1089
00:37:40,956 --> 00:37:42,357
- OKAY, NOW YOU'RE JUST
SCARING ME.

1090
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:43,958
- YEAH, THAT'S--
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

1091
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:47,396
I'M SAYING, YOU KNOW,
THE FUTURE IS SCARY.

1092
00:37:47,397 --> 00:37:50,732
BUT NOT IF YOU'VE GOT
SOMEONE TO HOLD.

1093
00:37:50,733 --> 00:37:56,638
OKAY, WHAT I NEED
IS SOMEONE TO COMPLEMENT ME.

1094
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:59,007
I WANT MY FRIENDS
TO LOOK AT MY GIRL

1095
00:37:59,008 --> 00:38:04,613
AND SAY, "WHOA, LOOK AT THAT
HOT BABE WITH THE 'C' MAN."

1096
00:38:04,614 --> 00:38:05,814
YEAH, YOU KNOW?

1097
00:38:05,815 --> 00:38:07,282
- YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YOU KNOW,

1098
00:38:07,283 --> 00:38:10,619
I THINK WE MIGHT BE LOOKING
FOR DIFFERENT THINGS, CHARLES.

1099
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,687
- [chuckles]

1100
00:38:11,688 --> 00:38:12,754
LET'S NOT BE COY HERE.

1101
00:38:12,755 --> 00:38:14,789
NEITHER ONE OF US ARE KIDS.

1102
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:17,792
I KNOW WHAT I WANT,
AND I'M PUTTING IT OUT THERE.

1103
00:38:17,793 --> 00:38:20,395
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT?

1104
00:38:52,262 --> 00:38:53,262
- HEY.

1105
00:38:53,263 --> 00:38:54,263
- [gasps]

1106
00:38:54,264 --> 00:38:55,530
JESUS.

1107
00:38:55,531 --> 00:38:57,633
AGAIN?

1108
00:38:57,634 --> 00:39:00,769
- SORRY.

1109
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,271
GOOD DATE?

1110
00:39:02,272 --> 00:39:03,405
- [sighs]

1111
00:39:03,406 --> 00:39:06,408
WELL, YEAH, HE DID PROPOSE.

1112
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:09,911
HE'S ALSO PROBABLY THE CREEPIEST
PERSON ON THE PLANET, SO...

1113
00:39:09,912 --> 00:39:11,212
- THAT'S SO WEIRD.

1114
00:39:11,213 --> 00:39:15,884
I MEAN, IT SEEMED LIKE
YOU GUYS WERE SUCH A GOOD MATCH.

1115
00:39:15,885 --> 00:39:18,920
SO DID THE TWO OF YOU DO IT?

1116
00:39:18,921 --> 00:39:20,289
- [giggles]

1117
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:23,057
NO.

1118
00:39:23,058 --> 00:39:25,260
ALL RIGHT, I AM GOING TO BED.

1119
00:39:25,261 --> 00:39:27,962
- I DON'T GET IT.

1120
00:39:27,963 --> 00:39:30,732
- GET WHAT?

1121
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:33,735
- I MEAN, I JUST DON'T GET
HOW YOU COULD GO OUT

1122
00:39:33,736 --> 00:39:36,405
ON SOME DUMB DATE
WITH SOME DUMB GUY

1123
00:39:36,406 --> 00:39:41,777
WHEN IT'S SO CLEAR
THAT I HAVE A THING FOR YOU.

1124
00:39:41,778 --> 00:39:43,011
I MEAN, IF YOU WANT TO,
YOU KNOW,

1125
00:39:43,012 --> 00:39:44,446
GET MARRIED OR MOVE IN
WITH SOMEONE

1126
00:39:44,447 --> 00:39:46,915
THEN YOU'RE PROBABLY
BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE,

1127
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:50,752
BUT I DO THINK
I'M A PRETTY GOOD REBOUND GUY.

1128
00:39:50,753 --> 00:39:56,625
- MM, AND YOU ARE OFFERING
YOUR SERVICES TO ME.

1129
00:39:56,626 --> 00:39:59,528
- YEAH,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

1130
00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:03,064
BUT I JUST THINK
THAT I AM EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED

1131
00:40:03,065 --> 00:40:05,334
AT THIS CROSSROADS
IN YOUR LIFE.

1132
00:40:05,335 --> 00:40:07,769
- DO YOU?

1133
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,738
WOW, YOU'RE REALLY
FOND OF YOURSELF, AREN'T YOU?

1134
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:10,905
- OH, COME ON.
GIVE ME A BREAK.

1135
00:40:10,906 --> 00:40:12,374
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH YOURSELF.

1136
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:13,742
YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE,

1137
00:40:13,743 --> 00:40:15,577
LIKE, THE MOST AWESOME
PERSON EVER.

1138
00:40:15,578 --> 00:40:17,446
- OKAY, HOW OLD ARE YOU?

1139
00:40:17,447 --> 00:40:19,514
- 30.

1140
00:40:19,515 --> 00:40:21,350
NEXT YEAR.

1141
00:40:21,351 --> 00:40:22,484
- HMM, OKAY, WELL,

1142
00:40:22,485 --> 00:40:25,186
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
30 NEXT YEAR.

1143
00:40:25,187 --> 00:40:26,588
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

1144
00:40:26,589 --> 00:40:27,922
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ME,

1145
00:40:27,923 --> 00:40:31,192
AND YOU CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT I NEED IN MY LIFE.

1146
00:40:31,193 --> 00:40:32,794
- MM-HMM.

1147
00:40:32,795 --> 00:40:34,529
YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE
ABOUT YOU BEST?

1148
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:35,797
- I DON'T CARE.

1149
00:40:35,798 --> 00:40:37,131
- YOU'RE DIFFICULT.

1150
00:40:37,132 --> 00:40:38,132
- OH.

1151
00:40:38,133 --> 00:40:39,368
- AND YOU'RE VERY SEXY

1152
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:41,035
BUT IN THIS FOREIGN FILM
KIND OF WAY

1153
00:40:41,036 --> 00:40:43,104
WITH THE ANGLES
AND THE ATTITUDE.

1154
00:40:43,105 --> 00:40:46,408
I DIG IT.

1155
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:48,443
- [sighs]

1156
00:40:48,444 --> 00:40:50,545
GO HOME, BYRON.

1157
00:41:08,431 --> 00:41:10,999
[door clatters open]

1158
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,634
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T
NOT HAVE A POINT.

1159
00:41:12,635 --> 00:41:14,369
- EVERYBODY NEEDS A REBOUND GUY.

1160
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,670
- I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
WHY DO I NEED

1161
00:41:15,671 --> 00:41:17,739
TO AUDITION MEN FOR IT
WHEN I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I NEED?

1162
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,708
- THAT IS EXACTLY MY POINT.

1163
00:41:19,709 --> 00:41:22,911
- SOMEBODY WHO'S UNCOMPLICATED,
CONVENIENT,

1164
00:41:22,912 --> 00:41:25,146
TOTALLY WRONG FOR ME,
AND SOMEBODY WHO I COULD NEVER

1165
00:41:25,147 --> 00:41:28,417
IN, LIKE, A MILLION YEARS
HAVE ANY REAL FEELINGS FOR.

1166
00:41:28,418 --> 00:41:31,052
- EXCEPT FOR THE RAVENOUS
ANIMAL ATTRACTION.

1167
00:41:31,053 --> 00:41:32,788
- NO OBLIGATIONS.
NO COMPLICATIONS.

1168
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:34,956
NO EXPECTATIONS.

1169
00:41:34,957 --> 00:41:39,093
- THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
HOW I LIVE MY LIFE.

1170
00:41:39,094 --> 00:41:43,598
SO...

1171
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,935
- OKAY, UM,
RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND.

1172
00:41:46,936 --> 00:41:48,303
- RAISE?

1173
00:41:48,304 --> 00:41:49,304
OKAY.

1174
00:41:49,305 --> 00:41:50,405
- OKAY, REPEAT AFTER ME.

1175
00:41:50,406 --> 00:41:53,374
I, BYRON...

1176
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:55,510
- OH, WOW, YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW MY LAST NAME?

1177
00:41:55,511 --> 00:41:57,045
OKAY, THAT'S GREAT.

1178
00:41:57,046 --> 00:42:02,651
- I, BYRON, PROMISE TO NEVER
FALL IN LOVE WITH SYLVIA,

1179
00:42:02,652 --> 00:42:05,353
NO MATTER HOW AWESOME
SHE MAY BE.

1180
00:42:05,354 --> 00:42:09,724
- I, BYRON, PROMISE THAT
IF ONE OF US BREAKS THIS DEAL,

1181
00:42:09,725 --> 00:42:11,225
IT'S NOT GONNA BE ME.

1182
00:42:11,226 --> 00:42:12,360
- OH, IT'S NOT GONNA BE ME.

1183
00:42:12,361 --> 00:42:13,428
- YES, IT IS.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

1184
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:14,663
- YEP.

1185
00:42:14,664 --> 00:42:16,565
- OKAY, YOU GONNA KISS ME,
OR YOU GONNA BE CLEVER?

1186
00:42:16,566 --> 00:42:18,867
- I'M GOING TO KISS YOU.

1187
00:42:18,868 --> 00:42:20,101
- OKAY, SOON, YOU THINK?

1188
00:42:20,102 --> 00:42:21,436
- I'M JUST BUILDING
THE TENSION--

1189
00:42:21,437 --> 00:42:22,537
- OH, MY GOD.

1190
00:42:22,538 --> 00:42:23,738

- OH, NO.

1201
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:44,359
- THAT LOOKS REALLY
UNCOMFORTABLE.

1202
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,895
- WE CAN GO BACK IN THERE.
- OKAY.

1203
00:42:46,896 --> 00:42:49,364

WHEN DID I START WANTING YOU?

1207
00:42:54,436 --> 00:42:56,270
- MY GUESS IS THAT YOU PROBABLY
ALWAYS WANTED ME

1208
00:42:56,271 --> 00:42:58,172
AND THAT YOU JUST FORGOT.

1209
00:42:58,173 --> 00:42:59,841
- I DON'T REALLY THINK SO.

1210
00:42:59,842 --> 00:43:01,877
- IT'S JUST AT THEORY, REALLY.

1211

THAT'S ANOTHER CONDITION.

YOU CAN'T TELL WALT.

- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1222
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,200
YOU WANT ME TO LIE
TO MY BEST FRIEND?

1223

00:56:32,454 --> 00:56:34,121
PROBABLY WOULDN'T
DO IT JUSTICE, THOUGH.

1569
00:56:34,122 --> 00:56:35,523
- NO, A DRAWING,
THAT'S GOOD.

1570
00:56:35,524 --> 00:56:37,358
YEAH, HAVE THAT ON MY DESK
BY THE MORNING.

00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,293

1574
00:57:04,018 --> 00:57:05,052
- I FEEL IT IS MY DUTY

1575
00:57:05,053 --> 00:57:07,488
TO INFORM YOU
THAT IT IS NOT RAINING.

1576
00:57:07,489 --> 00:57:09,356
- I DID TAKE NOTE OF THAT.

1577
00:57:09,357 --> 00:57:10,357
- I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT.

1578
00:57:10,358 --> 00:57:11,792
YOU ARE A PROFESSIONAL,
AFTER--

1579
00:57:11,793 --> 00:57:12,793
YOU WERE A PROFESSIONAL.

1580
00:57:12,794 --> 00:57:13,827
- NO, I STILL AM.

- NICE TO MEET YOU.

1595
00:57:39,321 --> 00:57:41,488
- SO ARE YOU WHO SYLVIA'S BEEN
SPENDING ALL HER TIME WITH?

1596
00:57:41,489 --> 00:57:43,257
- SHE'S PRACTICALLY
FALLEN OFF THIS PLANET.

1597
00:57:43,258 --> 00:57:44,558

1608
00:58:02,176 --> 00:58:03,277

1613
00:58:10,017 --> 00:58:11,118

1614
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:12,953

I'M NOT THAT YOUNG,
I GUESS.

- WE THOUGHT YOU WERE...

1625
00:58:29,103 --> 00:58:30,738
- WELL, THIS IS KIND OF
AWKWARD.

1626
00:58:30,739 --> 00:58:32,306
- OH, NO, MY GOSH.

1627
00:58:32,307 --> 00:58:33,507
- NO, MM-MM.

1628
00:58:33,508 --> 00:58:34,541

[chuckling]

1632
00:58:39,748 --> 00:58:41,415
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
IT WAS GREAT SEEING YOU.

1633
00:58:41,416 --> 00:58:42,416
- OH, SO GOOD.

1634
00:58:42,417 --> 00:58:43,617
- IT WAS GOOD.

1635
00:58:43,618 --> 00:58:47,821
I'M GLAD THAT WE
RAN INTO YOU HERE OF ALL PLACES.

1636
00:58:47,822 --> 00:58:49,657
- SO OKAY, IT WAS GREAT.

1637
00:58:49,658 --> 00:58:50,658
W-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1638
00:58:50,659 --> 00:58:52,025
- NOTHING.

1639
00:58:52,026 --> 00:58:54,161
- OKAY, WELL, IT CERTAINLY
LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING TO ME.

1640
00:58:54,162 --> 00:58:56,129
- ALL RIGHT.

1641
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:57,130
- OKAY, GREAT.

1642
00:58:57,131 --> 00:58:58,399
- OKAY, WE'LL SEE YOU GUYS SOON.

1643
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,400
- YEAH.
- OKAY, BYE.

1644
00:58:59,401 --> 00:59:00,401
- BYE-BYE, BYRON.

1645
00:59:00,402 --> 00:59:01,568
OH, GOD, THAT SOUNDS SILLY.

1646
00:59:01,569 --> 00:59:02,603
"BYE-BYE, BYRON."

1647
00:59:02,604 --> 00:59:03,604
OH, IT'S FUNNY, RIGHT?

1648
00:59:03,605 --> 00:59:04,605
- YEAH, IT DOES.

1649
00:59:04,606 --> 00:59:05,606
OKAY, WALK AWAY NOW.

1650
00:59:05,607 --> 00:59:06,607
- OH, YEAH, OKAY.
BYE.

1651
00:59:06,608 --> 00:59:07,608
- BYE-BYE.

1652
00:59:07,609 --> 00:59:09,543
- BYE.

1653
00:59:12,146 --> 00:59:15,449
SO THOSE WERE MY FRIENDS.

1654
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:19,085
- YEAH, THAT SUCKS.

1655
00:59:19,086 --> 00:59:22,022
[thunder crashes]

1656
00:59:26,494 --> 00:59:29,596
AND IT'S RAINING.

1657
00:59:29,597 --> 00:59:31,598
- YEAH.

1658
00:59:35,169 --> 00:59:38,138
- SO, SYLVIA,

1659
00:59:38,139 --> 00:59:40,140
HOW'S IT GOING?

1660
00:59:40,141 --> 00:59:43,243
- I AM LIVING THE DREAM, IRVING.

1661
00:59:43,244 --> 00:59:47,581
- YEAH, SO WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER
FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW.

1662
00:59:47,582 --> 00:59:51,051
- FIVE FUN-FILLED WEEKS.

1663
00:59:51,052 --> 00:59:55,856
- I THINK IT'S TIME WE STOP
PLAYING THESE LITTLE GAMES.

1664
00:59:55,857 --> 00:59:58,392
- WHAT GAMES ARE WE PLAYING,
IRVING?

1665
00:59:58,393 --> 01:00:01,262
- THE ONE WHERE YOU PRETEND
YOU'RE NOT INTO ME.

1666
01:00:01,263 --> 01:00:05,999
I PRETEND NOT TO NOTICE
YOUR LUST-FILLED GAZES.

1667
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,368
- OH.

1668
01:00:07,369 --> 01:00:12,739
- I MEAN, WE'RE BOTH, YOU KNOW,
MATURE, SEXUAL BEINGS.

1669
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:15,543
I SAY IT'S TIME WE STOP
TORTURING OURSELVES

1670
01:00:15,544 --> 01:00:20,113
AND YOU KNOW, GIVE INTO
OUR ANIMAL NATURE.

1671
01:00:20,114 --> 01:00:22,683
- YEAH, I'M ON MY BREAK,
IRVING.

1672
01:00:22,684 --> 01:00:24,285
- I MEAN, SURE, YOU'RE--

1673
01:00:24,286 --> 01:00:26,820
YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT OLDER
THAN ANYBODY ELSE HERE,

1674
01:00:26,821 --> 01:00:28,789
BUT YOU KNOW,
I'M COOL WITH THAT.

1675
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:30,123
I'M DOWN WITH THAT.

1676
01:00:30,124 --> 01:00:31,225
I MEAN, YOU COULD--

1677
01:00:31,226 --> 01:00:32,726
- [gagging]

1678
01:00:32,727 --> 01:00:35,796
- YOU COULD PROBABLY TEACH ME
SOME SHIT.

1679
01:00:35,797 --> 01:00:38,799
- GOD, I AM ON MY BREAK.

1680
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,967
- [coughing]

1681
01:00:40,968 --> 01:00:42,769
- OKAY, HERE WE GO.
COME ON.

1682
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:44,171
IT'S OKAY.
HERE WE GO.

1683
01:00:44,172 --> 01:00:46,607
- THE GUY IS CHOKING.
OH, MY GOD.

- [splutters]

1685
01:00:47,609 --> 01:00:49,443
- THERE YOU GO.

1686
01:00:49,444 --> 01:00:50,544
OH!

1687
01:00:50,545 --> 01:00:53,180
SORRY.

1688
01:00:53,181 --> 01:00:56,116
[applause]

1689
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,520
- HERE IT IS.

1690
01:00:59,521 --> 01:01:01,488
"SASSY WEATHER GIRL
SAVES THE DAY."

1691
01:01:01,489 --> 01:01:02,489
- MOVE IT.

1692
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:03,890
- I REALLY HATE
THAT "SASSY" THING.

1693
01:01:03,891 --> 01:01:05,359
- LOOK, YOU'RE SASSY.
JUST ACCEPT IT.

1694
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,360
- SO SASSY.

1695
01:01:06,361 --> 01:01:07,428
- WAIT, DO I LOOK FAT IN THAT?

1696
01:01:07,429 --> 01:01:08,462
I THINK I LOOK FAT IN THAT.

1697
01:01:08,463 --> 01:01:09,763
- NO, YOU LOOK GREAT.
LOOK AT YOU.

1698
01:01:09,764 --> 01:01:10,764
- HELLO, YEAH.

1699
01:01:10,765 --> 01:01:14,401
HEY, FAT GIRL.

1700
01:01:14,402 --> 01:01:15,969
GO BACK TO THAT PART
WHERE SHE DROPS HIM.

1701
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:18,405
THAT'S MY FAVORITE.

1702
01:01:18,406 --> 01:01:21,108
- UM, WHAT?
AT THE END?

1703
01:01:21,109 --> 01:01:22,876
- SHIT.

1704
01:01:22,877 --> 01:01:24,278
- WHAT?
- I KNEW IT.

1705
01:01:24,279 --> 01:01:25,279
YOU LIKE HER.

1706
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,280
YOU LIKE HER.

1707
01:01:26,281 --> 01:01:27,481
I KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

1708
01:01:27,482 --> 01:01:28,482
- COME ON, MAN, I TOLD YOU.

1709
01:01:28,483 --> 01:01:29,483
I DON'T LIKE HER.

1710
01:01:29,484 --> 01:01:31,051
THIS IS A CASUAL THING.

1711
01:01:31,052 --> 01:01:32,052
- WHATEVER, MAN.

1712
01:01:32,053 --> 01:01:33,053
YOU GONNA TELL HER?

1713
01:01:33,054 --> 01:01:34,755
- TELL HER WHAT?

1714
01:01:34,756 --> 01:01:35,956
- LOOK, YOU BETTER TELL HER,

1715
01:01:35,957 --> 01:01:37,358
'CAUSE SHE'S ROLLED UP
THE WINDOW.

1716
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:38,359
- THE WINDOW?

1717
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,660
WHAT ARE YOU EVEN
TALKING ABOUT?

1718
01:01:39,661 --> 01:01:40,961
- THE WINDOW IS UP.

1719
01:01:40,962 --> 01:01:42,296
AND YOU'RE ON THAT SIDE OF IT.

1720
01:01:42,297 --> 01:01:43,364
LOOK, I KNOW HER, MAN.

1721
01:01:43,365 --> 01:01:44,798
YOU CAN'T BREAK THROUGH
THE WINDOW.

1722
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:45,799
THAT SHIT'S BULLETPROOF.

1723
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,134
SHE HAS TO ROLL IT DOWN.

1724
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,469
THE ONLY WAY
SHE'S GOING TO DO THAT

1725
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:50,404
IS IF YOU TELL HER
YOU DIG HER.

1726
01:01:53,708 --> 01:01:55,108
- BULLETPROOF, HUH?

1727
01:01:55,109 --> 01:01:57,177
- OF COURSE, THE PROBLEM IS,
IF YOU TELL HER YOU DIG HER

1728
01:01:57,178 --> 01:01:58,879
AND SHE DOESN'T WANT TO ROLL
DOWN THE WINDOW,

1729
01:01:58,880 --> 01:01:59,880
SHE'LL CUT OFF THE SEX.

1730
01:01:59,881 --> 01:02:01,081
HAVING A CASUAL RELATIONSHIP

1731
01:02:01,082 --> 01:02:02,849
WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS EMOTIONS
IS MESSY, MAN.

1732
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:04,251
- STOP, ALL RIGHT?
I DON'T LIKE HER.

1733
01:02:04,252 --> 01:02:05,819
I DON'T WANT HER TO ROLL DOWN
HER WINDOW.

1734
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:07,988
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO GET INTO
HER METAPHORICAL CAR, OKAY?

1735
01:02:07,989 --> 01:02:09,757
LEAVE IT ALONE.

1736
01:02:09,758 --> 01:02:11,358
- YEAH, THAT'S IT, GOOD.

1737
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:12,493
THAT'S GOOD.

1738
01:02:12,494 --> 01:02:14,161
THROW A LITTLE FIT THERE.
GOOD FOR YOU.

1739
01:02:14,162 --> 01:02:15,996
YOU KNOW THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
SHE WANTS TO AVOID

1740
01:02:15,997 --> 01:02:17,698
BY ROLLING UP THE WINDOW
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

1741
01:02:17,699 --> 01:02:18,766
WAY TO FALL INTO HER TRAP.

1742
01:02:18,767 --> 01:02:19,767
- YOU--

1743
01:02:19,768 --> 01:02:22,202
[door clicks open]

1744
01:02:22,203 --> 01:02:26,106
- WHAT?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1745
01:02:26,107 --> 01:02:27,374
- FIRST OFF, SYLVIA,

1746
01:02:27,375 --> 01:02:29,376
I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR COMING IN THIS MORNING.

1747
01:02:29,377 --> 01:02:31,812
I KNOW IT MUST BE A BIT AWKWARD.

1748
01:02:31,813 --> 01:02:34,114
- WELL, YEAH, BUT, UH,
COULDN'T STAY AWAY, YOU KNOW?

1749
01:02:34,115 --> 01:02:35,449
CURIOSITY AND ALL THAT.

1750
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:36,617
- RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

1751
01:02:36,618 --> 01:02:38,619
SO LET'S GET DOWN
TO BRASS TACKS.

1752
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:41,755
WE HAVE RERUN YOUR LAST SHOW
FOUR TIMES

1753
01:02:41,756 --> 01:02:43,089
IN THE SIX WEEKS
YOU'VE BEEN GONE.

1754
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:45,359
AND THE RATINGS HAVE
GOTTEN BETTER EVERY TIME.

1755
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,627
IT IS ALL OVER THE INTERNET

1756
01:02:46,628 --> 01:02:49,296
AND SO IS THAT VIDEO OF YOU,
BY THE WAY,

1757
01:02:49,297 --> 01:02:50,497
SAVING THE MAN FROM CHOKING.

1758
01:02:50,498 --> 01:02:54,702
EVERYBODY SEEMS TO KNOW
THE SASSY WEATHER GIRL.

1759
01:02:54,703 --> 01:02:56,169
- GOD, YOU'VE GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME.

1760
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:58,639
- NO, NO, NO, WE GET LETTERS,
PHONE CALLS APPLAUDING YOU,

1761
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,807
AND--HEY, JOSH!

1762
01:02:59,808 --> 01:03:01,642
SHUT THAT OFF.

1763
01:03:01,643 --> 01:03:04,645
OUR VIEWERS LOVE YOU
MORE THAN EVER BEFORE.

1764
01:03:04,646 --> 01:03:07,147
THEY SAY YOU'VE GOT VERVE.

1765
01:03:07,148 --> 01:03:08,382
LET ME HEAR YOU SAY IT.

1766
01:03:08,383 --> 01:03:09,383
- VERVE.

1767
01:03:09,384 --> 01:03:10,551
- SAY IT LOUDER.
- VER--OKAY.

1768
01:03:10,552 --> 01:03:11,618
- THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT, BABE.

1769
01:03:11,619 --> 01:03:12,919
AND THAT'S WHAT
THEY WANT TO SEE.

1770
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,155
WELL, AND WE'RE
GOING INTO SWEEPS.

1771
01:03:15,156 --> 01:03:16,189
- SO WHAT?

1772
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:18,024
YOU WANT ME TO COME BACK
TO MY OLD JOB?

1773
01:03:18,025 --> 01:03:19,259
- NO, NO,
NOT YOUR OLD JOB.

1774
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:21,161
NO, YOUR OLD JOB,
YOU POPPED IN EVERY 15 MINUTES.

1775
01:03:21,162 --> 01:03:26,066
NO, MMM, WE WANT YOU
TO COANCHOR.

1776
01:03:26,067 --> 01:03:27,100
- COANCHOR?

1777
01:03:27,101 --> 01:03:28,134
- YOU AND DALE.

1778
01:03:28,135 --> 01:03:29,302
- OH, NO, NO.
I CAN'T--

1779
01:03:29,303 --> 01:03:30,337
- YES, YES, COME.

1780
01:03:30,338 --> 01:03:31,338
YES, YES, NO, SEE?

1781
01:03:31,339 --> 01:03:34,475
THAT'S--THAT'S THE HOOK, BABE.

1782
01:03:34,476 --> 01:03:36,042
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY
WANTS TO SEE:

1783
01:03:36,043 --> 01:03:38,779
YOU TWO GOING BACK AND FORTH
GOING AT IT.

1784
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:40,914
AND YOU CAN SAY
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

1785
01:03:40,915 --> 01:03:43,884
IN FACT, WE WANT YOU TO.

1786
01:03:43,885 --> 01:03:46,587
- WHAT ABOUT THE MOUSY BITCH?

1787
01:03:46,588 --> 01:03:47,755
- WHO?

1788
01:03:47,756 --> 01:03:48,756
- MOUSY BITCH.

1789
01:03:48,757 --> 01:03:50,957
- MM, MM.

1790
01:03:50,958 --> 01:03:51,992
THAT MOUSY BITCH.

1791
01:03:51,993 --> 01:03:54,795
WELL,
SINCE SHE AND DALE BROKE UP,

1792
01:03:54,796 --> 01:03:58,365
SHE'S BECOME INCREASINGLY
DIFFICULT.

1793
01:03:58,366 --> 01:04:01,268
IF YOU ASK ME,
BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

1794
01:04:01,269 --> 01:04:03,404
I THINK THE HEIFER'S DRINKING.

1795
01:04:03,405 --> 01:04:05,305
- REALLY?
- MM.

1796
01:04:05,306 --> 01:04:06,306
REALLY.

1797
01:04:06,307 --> 01:04:07,775
- HUH.

1798
01:04:11,813 --> 01:04:13,480
- ARE YOU COMING BACK?

1799
01:04:13,481 --> 01:04:15,816
- DOES THAT IDEA SCARE YOU?

1800
01:04:15,817 --> 01:04:19,286
- NO, ACTUALLY,
I SUGGESTED IT.

1801
01:04:19,287 --> 01:04:21,254
- REALLY?

1802
01:04:21,255 --> 01:04:24,558
- YEAH, YEAH, I MISS YOU.

1803
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:27,828
I KNOW IT SOUNDS CORNY,
BUT I DO.

1804
01:04:27,829 --> 01:04:29,797
- WELL, I HAVEN'T GIVEN FITZ
MY ANSWER YET,

1805
01:04:29,798 --> 01:04:33,400
BUT SOMEHOW IT DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE THE BEST IDEA EVER.

1806
01:04:33,401 --> 01:04:36,336
- WELL, MAYBE WE COULD
GET TOGETHER.

1807
01:04:36,337 --> 01:04:38,371
WE COULD TALK.

1808
01:04:38,372 --> 01:04:40,340
MAYBE WE COULD HAVE DINNER.

1809
01:04:40,341 --> 01:04:45,813
MAYBE I COULD CALM SOME FEARS.

1810
01:04:45,814 --> 01:04:47,380
- ARE YOU ASKING ME
ON A DATE?

1811
01:04:47,381 --> 01:04:48,381
- IF YOU WANT IT TO BE.

1812
01:04:48,382 --> 01:04:51,852
IF NOT,
A DINNER BETWEEN COLLEAGUES,

1813
01:04:51,853 --> 01:04:55,456
A BUSINESS DINNER.

1814
01:04:55,457 --> 01:04:57,558
- DALE?

1815
01:04:57,559 --> 01:05:00,561
DALEY?

1816
01:05:00,562 --> 01:05:04,932
OH, OH, LOOKEE HERE.

1817
01:05:04,933 --> 01:05:08,134
TWO LOVEBIRDS
REU-FUCKING-NITED.

1818
01:05:08,135 --> 01:05:12,639
- SHERRY,
GO BACK IN YOUR DRESSING ROOM.

1819
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,941
- OH, SORRY,
FIRST YOU DUMP ME,

1820
01:05:13,942 --> 01:05:16,677
AND NOW YOU THINK
YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT TO DO?

1821
01:05:16,678 --> 01:05:18,712
WELL, I GOT NEWS FOR YOU,
ASSHOLE.

1822
01:05:18,713 --> 01:05:20,481
YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME.

1823
01:05:20,482 --> 01:05:24,952
I'M GOING TO WHAT I WANT TO DO
AND WHEN I WANT IT.

1824
01:05:24,953 --> 01:05:26,219
HI, SYLVIA.

1825
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:27,821
- HEY, SHERRY.

1826
01:05:27,822 --> 01:05:30,290
- I GUESS YOU THINK
THIS IS KARMA, HUH?

1827
01:05:30,291 --> 01:05:31,725
- NO, I DIDN'T--
I DIDN'T THINK THAT.

1828
01:05:31,726 --> 01:05:33,660
- THE MOUSY BITCH GETS HERS
IN THE END, AM I RIGHT?

1829
01:05:33,661 --> 01:05:34,661
"OH, NO."

1830
01:05:34,662 --> 01:05:37,731
MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO ME.

1831
01:05:37,732 --> 01:05:40,100
HEY, DALE, YOU WANT TO SEE
MY IMPRESSION OF SYLVIA?

1832
01:05:40,101 --> 01:05:41,535
"HI, I'M SYLVIA.

1833
01:05:41,536 --> 01:05:45,338
"I HAVE A PSYCHOTIC EPISODE
ON LIVE TELEVISION.

1834
01:05:45,339 --> 01:05:47,007
"I USED SOME TERRIBLE,
FOUL LANGUAGE,

1835
01:05:47,008 --> 01:05:51,578
"AND I DESCRIBED A SEX ACT
ON A MORNING TV SHOW.

1836
01:05:51,579 --> 01:05:53,647
"I'M VERY, VERY MEAN
TO STUPID SHERRY,

1837
01:05:53,648 --> 01:05:55,148
"AND I CALL HER
REALLY HURTFUL NAMES

1838
01:05:55,149 --> 01:05:57,751
"THAT JUST MIGHT REMIND HER
OF SOME STUFF FROM CHILDHOOD,

1839
01:05:57,752 --> 01:05:59,820
"AND THEN WHEN SWEEPS
COMES AROUND,

1840
01:05:59,821 --> 01:06:00,988
I TAKE HER JOB."

1841
01:06:00,989 --> 01:06:02,756
OH, AND THIS IS MY FAVORITE ONE.

1842
01:06:02,757 --> 01:06:06,026
"THE MAN I EMASCULATED IN FRONT
OF MILLIONS OF SEATTLEITES

1843
01:06:06,027 --> 01:06:09,129
STARTS WANTING ME BACK."

1844
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:10,764
HOW THE FUCK DOES THAT HAPPEN?

1845
01:06:10,765 --> 01:06:13,734
I MEAN, THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

1846
01:06:13,735 --> 01:06:15,903
UNLESS I'M BEING PUNISHED
BY A GOD.

1847
01:06:15,904 --> 01:06:19,406
OH, YOU GUYS THINK
GOD'S MAD AT ME?

1848
01:06:19,407 --> 01:06:20,574
- NO, I DOUBT IT.

1849
01:06:20,575 --> 01:06:22,142
- OH, SHUT UP!

1850
01:06:22,143 --> 01:06:25,946
BULLSHIT!
YOU DON'T KNOW!

1851
01:06:28,215 --> 01:06:30,617
SO YOU GUYS ARE GETTING
BACK TOGETHER, HUH?

1852
01:06:30,618 --> 01:06:31,919
THAT'S...

1853
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:32,920
[screams]

1854
01:06:32,921 --> 01:06:35,522
[head thinks]

1855
01:06:36,991 --> 01:06:38,559
MY FACE HURTS.

1856
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,326
- WE'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU, MA'AM.

1857
01:06:40,327 --> 01:06:41,394
- I LOVE YOU.

1858
01:06:41,395 --> 01:06:42,563
CAN YOU GRAB
MY WATER BOTTLE?

1859
01:06:42,564 --> 01:06:43,564
- NO, MA'AM.

1860
01:06:43,565 --> 01:06:44,898
- BUT IT'S RIGHT THERE.

1861
01:06:44,899 --> 01:06:45,899
- NO.

1862
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:47,167
- W-W-WHY?

1863
01:06:47,168 --> 01:06:49,636
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME
TO STAY HYDRATED.

1864
01:06:49,637 --> 01:06:51,404
- WELL, I WOULD JUST LIKE
TO CONGRATULATE YOU

1865
01:06:51,405 --> 01:06:52,573
ON ANOTHER DRAMATIC ENDING

1866
01:06:52,574 --> 01:06:53,974
TO ANOTHER ROMANTIC
RELATIONSHIP.

1867
01:06:53,975 --> 01:06:54,975
- WHO'S YOUR MANAGER?

1868
01:06:54,976 --> 01:06:55,976
- WELL, AT LEAST THIS TIME

1869
01:06:55,977 --> 01:06:56,977
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO KILL ME.

1870
01:06:56,978 --> 01:06:58,211
SHE WANTED TO KILL YOU.

1871
01:06:58,212 --> 01:06:59,279
- DETAILS.

1872
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,513
- I NEED IT!

1873
01:07:00,514 --> 01:07:04,718
- YOU NEVER RESPONDED
TO MY DINNER INVITATION.

1874
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:05,652
- YOU'RE DOING WHAT?

1875
01:07:05,653 --> 01:07:06,720
- STOP SAYING THAT.

1876
01:07:06,721 --> 01:07:08,054
- I'M SORRY.

1877
01:07:08,055 --> 01:07:09,956
I'M JUST HAVING A HARD TIME
WITH THE LOGIC HERE.

1878
01:07:09,957 --> 01:07:12,058
- THEY ARE OFFERING ME A RAISE,
AND I GET TO COANCHOR.

1879
01:07:12,059 --> 01:07:13,260
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, WALT?

1880
01:07:13,261 --> 01:07:15,061
IT MEANS I GET TO DELIVER
THE NEWS.

1881
01:07:15,062 --> 01:07:17,130
REAL NEWS, NOT JUST THE WEATHER.

1882
01:07:17,131 --> 01:07:18,965
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
I STILL HAVE TO DO THE WEATHER,

1883
01:07:18,966 --> 01:07:20,300
BUT I GET
TO DO OTHER STUFF TOO NOW.

1884
01:07:20,301 --> 01:07:23,169
- ALL OF THAT FOR THE
ROCK-BOTTOM PRICE OF YOUR SOUL.

1885
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:24,704
- WOULD YOU STOP BEING
SO DRAMATIC?

1886
01:07:24,705 --> 01:07:26,139
- WILL YOU STOP BEING
SUCH A SELLOUT?

1887
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:27,140
- WALT.

1888
01:07:27,141 --> 01:07:29,242
- SYLVIA, THEY FIRED YOU
WITH PREJUDICE.

1889
01:07:29,243 --> 01:07:30,343
- THEY DID NOT FIRE ME.

1890
01:07:30,344 --> 01:07:31,511
I QUIT.
- OH.

1891
01:07:31,512 --> 01:07:32,712
- LOOK, THIS IS A REAL JOB,

1892
01:07:32,713 --> 01:07:33,880
ONE WHERE I NEVER HAVE TO TOUCH

1893
01:07:33,881 --> 01:07:35,715
DIRTY DISHES OR LEFTOVER FOOD
AGAIN.

1894
01:07:35,716 --> 01:07:37,684
AND IF I TAKE IT,
THERE'S A SIGNING BONUS,

1895
01:07:37,685 --> 01:07:39,619
WHICH MEANS I GET TO FIND
MY OWN PLACE IMMEDIATELY

1896
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:41,220
AND PAY YOU BACK
ALL THE MONEY I OWE YOU.

1897
01:07:41,221 --> 01:07:42,522
- I DON'T WANT YOUR DIRTY MONEY.

1898
01:07:42,523 --> 01:07:44,991
I WANT YOU TO HAVE SOME
GODDAMN SELF-RESPECT.

1899
01:07:44,992 --> 01:07:47,193
- GOD, YOU ARE SO
SELF-IMPORTANT.

1900
01:07:47,194 --> 01:07:48,762
- THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

1901
01:07:48,763 --> 01:07:50,463
- I WANT A LIFE, WALT, OKAY?

1902
01:07:50,464 --> 01:07:51,898
I AM A 35-YEAR-OLD WOMAN,

1903
01:07:51,899 --> 01:07:54,066
AND I'M LIVING
LIKE A COLLEGE FRESHMAN.

1904
01:07:54,067 --> 01:07:55,067
I HAVE NO MONEY.

1905
01:07:55,068 --> 01:07:56,068
I AM WAITING TABLES.

1906
01:07:56,069 --> 01:07:57,236
I HAVE A ROOMMATE.

1907
01:07:57,237 --> 01:07:59,539
AND I AM SLEEPING WITH
THE GUY ACROSS THE HALL.

1908
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:01,374
DON'T YOU TALK TO ME
ABOUT SELF-RESPECT, WALT.

1909
01:08:01,375 --> 01:08:03,109
I'M DOING THIS
BECAUSE I DESERVE BETTER.

1910
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:04,577
- OH, IS THAT WHY
YOU'RE GOING ON A DATE

1911
01:08:04,578 --> 01:08:06,879
WITH THE GUY WHO CHEATED ON YOU
AND BROKE YOUR HEART?

1912
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:07,980
- IT IS NOT A DATE.

1913
01:08:07,981 --> 01:08:09,582
IT IS A BUSINESS DINNER
WITH A COLLEAGUE.

1914
01:08:09,583 --> 01:08:10,583
- SHUT UP!

1915
01:08:10,584 --> 01:08:11,785
- AND I THINK "BROKE YOUR HEART"

1916
01:08:11,786 --> 01:08:13,320
IS OVERDOING IT A BIT,
DON'T YOU THINK?

1917
01:08:13,321 --> 01:08:14,754
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

1918
01:08:14,755 --> 01:08:16,656
I'M JUST GOING TO SAY THIS,
AND THEN I'M WALKING.

1919
01:08:16,657 --> 01:08:17,657
- OH, I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT.

1920
01:08:17,658 --> 01:08:18,692
- OH, I'M WALKING

1921
01:08:18,693 --> 01:08:20,092
JUST AS SOON AS I SAY
THIS ONE THING.

1922
01:08:20,093 --> 01:08:21,093
YOU READY?
- WHAT?

1923
01:08:21,094 --> 01:08:24,096
- YOU READY?
- WHAT?

1924
01:08:24,097 --> 01:08:26,499
- MOM WOULD BE REALLY
DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

1925
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,134
THAT'S RIGHT.

1926
01:08:28,135 --> 01:08:31,604
I INVOKED MOM.

1927
01:08:31,605 --> 01:08:33,707
- MOM WOULD BE REALLY
DISAPPOINTED IN ME?

1928
01:08:33,708 --> 01:08:34,808
IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID?

1929
01:08:34,809 --> 01:08:37,344
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

1930
01:08:37,345 --> 01:08:39,212
- OH.

1931
01:08:39,213 --> 01:08:41,080
WELL, THAT'S INTERESTING, WALT,

1932
01:08:41,081 --> 01:08:43,350
CONSIDERING
THAT MOM WORKED

1933
01:08:43,351 --> 01:08:45,251
UNTIL SHE COULD BARELY STAND UP
FROM THE PAIN

1934
01:08:45,252 --> 01:08:46,820
WHILE OUR FATHER
SAT ON THE COUCH ALL DAY

1935
01:08:46,821 --> 01:08:48,254
DOING NOTHING
BUT PASS JUDGMENTS.

1936
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,255
WAIT A MINUTE.

1937
01:08:49,256 --> 01:08:50,256
WHO ELSE DOES THAT, WALT?

1938
01:08:50,257 --> 01:08:51,524
LET ME THINK--UH-OH.

1939
01:08:51,525 --> 01:08:53,326
YOU KNOW WHO ELSE DOES THAT?
YOU DO THAT, WALT.

1940
01:08:53,327 --> 01:08:55,362
SO WHILE I MAY BE A HUGE
DISAPPOINTMENT TO OUR MOTHER,

1941
01:08:55,363 --> 01:08:56,396
I TAKE SOLACE IN THE FACT

1942
01:08:56,397 --> 01:08:58,231
THAT WHEREVER
THAT SON OF A BITCH IS,

1943
01:08:58,232 --> 01:08:59,399
HE IS PROBABLY REALLY PROUD

1944
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,168
OF THE FINE YOUNG MAN
YOU'VE BECOME.

1945
01:09:02,169 --> 01:09:05,638
- [scoffs]

1946
01:09:05,639 --> 01:09:07,474
OKAY.

1947
01:09:07,475 --> 01:09:09,642
OKAY.

1948
01:09:09,643 --> 01:09:13,079
YOU DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO,
SYLVIA.

1949
01:09:16,751 --> 01:09:18,551
[glass shatters]

1950
01:09:18,552 --> 01:09:19,819
- SHIT.

1951
01:09:28,629 --> 01:09:29,629
- HEY.

1952
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:32,465
- HEY.

1953
01:09:32,466 --> 01:09:35,167
- I JUST TALKED TO WALT.

1954
01:09:35,168 --> 01:09:37,771
ARE YOU OKAY?

1955
01:09:37,772 --> 01:09:39,138
- YEAH.
NO, I'M FINE, THANKS.

1956
01:09:39,139 --> 01:09:41,307
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW.

1957
01:09:41,308 --> 01:09:43,510
YOU KNOW ME AND WALT.
WE'RE ALWAYS BICKERING.

1958
01:09:43,511 --> 01:09:47,346
- YEAH, THAT DIDN'T SOUND
LIKE BICKERING.

1959
01:09:50,484 --> 01:09:53,720
- UM, WELL,
I'M KIND OF RUNNING LATE, SO...

1960
01:09:53,721 --> 01:09:57,056
- RIGHT, SO YOU'RE GOING BACK
TO THE MORNING SHOW?

1961
01:09:57,057 --> 01:09:58,925
- CONSIDERING IT.

1962
01:09:58,926 --> 01:10:01,027
- AND THE GUY?

1963
01:10:01,028 --> 01:10:02,995
YOU'RE, UH, YOU'RE GONNA
GO OUT WITH HIM?

1964
01:10:02,996 --> 01:10:05,064
- MM-HMM.

1965
01:10:05,065 --> 01:10:06,466
- THE HAIRCUT?

1966
01:10:06,467 --> 01:10:09,436
- YEAH, I--CAN WE TALK ABOUT
THIS LATER, PLEASE?

1967
01:10:09,437 --> 01:10:11,704
- YEAH, WELL, YOU WILL HAVE
ALREADY GONE OUT WITH HIM LATER,

1968
01:10:11,705 --> 01:10:14,273
SO THAT TALK WILL BE MOOT.

1969
01:10:14,274 --> 01:10:16,910
- BYRON, DON'T ACT LIKE THIS,
OKAY?

1970
01:10:16,911 --> 01:10:17,911
- ACT LIKE THIS?

1971
01:10:17,912 --> 01:10:19,679
ACT LIKE WHAT?

1972
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,380
I'M NOT ACTING.
YOU'RE ACTING.

1973
01:10:21,381 --> 01:10:22,816
I'M JUST REACTING HERE.

1974
01:10:22,817 --> 01:10:24,751
- WE HAD A DEAL,
REMEMBER?

1975
01:10:24,752 --> 01:10:27,019
WE--NO EMOTIONS.

1976
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:28,555
NO COMMITMENT, RIGHT?

1977
01:10:28,556 --> 01:10:31,157
WE'RE JUST--
WE'VE BEEN HAVING FUN.

1978
01:10:31,158 --> 01:10:33,259
- YEAH, I REMEMBER THE DEAL.

1979
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:34,961
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME
WHAT THE DEAL IS

1980
01:10:34,962 --> 01:10:38,631
'CAUSE I REMEMBER IT, SO...

1981
01:10:38,632 --> 01:10:40,567
- SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

1982
01:10:44,638 --> 01:10:47,674
- IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

1983
01:10:49,209 --> 01:10:50,309
THE PROBLEM IS THAT

1984
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:52,712
THAT DEAL WAS MADE,
LIKE, FOREVER AGO.

1985
01:10:52,713 --> 01:10:54,113
RIGHT?

1986
01:10:54,114 --> 01:10:56,616
I MEAN, THIS WAS BEFORE
WE KNEW EACH OTHER

1987
01:10:56,617 --> 01:10:58,317
AND BEFORE WE SPENT
ALL THIS TIME TOGETHER,

1988
01:10:58,318 --> 01:11:00,954
AND--AND--AND WE LIKED
EACH OTHER, AND WE HAD FUN,

1989
01:11:00,955 --> 01:11:02,121
AND--AND IT WAS BEFORE

1990
01:11:02,122 --> 01:11:05,492
I PICKED YOU THAT STUPID FLOWER
OFF THE TABLE.

1991
01:11:05,493 --> 01:11:08,828
HEY, HEY.

1992
01:11:08,829 --> 01:11:10,763
WE HAVE A GOOD THING HERE.

1993
01:11:14,635 --> 01:11:17,670
I LIKE YOU.

1994
01:11:17,671 --> 01:11:21,374
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO SEE ANYBODY ELSE.

1995
01:11:21,375 --> 01:11:28,648
I JUST--I THOUGHT THAT WE HAD
KIND OF MOVED PAST THE DEAL.

1996
01:11:33,487 --> 01:11:36,756
- WELL, UM...

1997
01:11:36,757 --> 01:11:40,693
I HAVEN'T FELT THAT--
I HAVEN'T FELT THAT WAY.

1998
01:11:45,298 --> 01:11:47,800
- OH, UH, WELL...

1999
01:11:47,801 --> 01:11:49,268
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

2000
01:11:49,269 --> 01:11:51,070
- LOOK, BYRON, LISTEN, I...

2001
01:11:51,071 --> 01:11:55,241
- NO, UM,
I WAS MISTAKEN.

2002
01:11:55,242 --> 01:11:56,643
[laughs]

2003
01:11:56,644 --> 01:12:00,212
UM, GOD, I JUST--

2004
01:12:00,213 --> 01:12:02,949
I FEEL SO NOT COOL
RIGHT NOW.

2005
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:04,851
I SHOULD GO.

2006
01:12:04,852 --> 01:12:05,852
- LISTEN TO ME.

2007
01:12:05,853 --> 01:12:09,088
BYRON, I--LOOK,
I LIKE YOU A LOT.

2008
01:12:09,089 --> 01:12:11,691
I DO.
I JUST--

2009
01:12:11,692 --> 01:12:13,426
WE'RE TOO DIFFERENT,
YOU KNOW?

2010
01:12:13,427 --> 01:12:18,330
AND I NEED TO BE
WITH A GROWN-UP.

2011
01:12:18,331 --> 01:12:19,966
- RIGHT.

2012
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:23,636
SOMEBODY NOT ME.

2013
01:12:23,637 --> 01:12:28,207
THAT'S OKAY.

2014
01:12:28,208 --> 01:12:31,711
BUT I THINK THAT
WE SHOULD STOP TALKING NOW.

2015
01:12:31,712 --> 01:12:33,646
GOOD LUCK ON YOUR DATE, THOUGH.

2016
01:12:42,556 --> 01:12:43,556
- SYLVIA?

2017
01:12:43,557 --> 01:12:45,658
- YEAH?

2018
01:12:45,659 --> 01:12:47,426
- OH, GOD, HI, SORRY.

2019
01:12:47,427 --> 01:12:49,495
YES, PLEASE.

THANK YOU.

2022
01:12:57,370 --> 01:13:01,140
- WHERE ARE YOU?

2023
01:13:01,141 --> 01:13:02,241
- I'M HERE.

2024
01:13:02,242 --> 01:13:04,010
I JUST, YOU KNOW,
I HAVE A LOT ON MY MIND.

2025
01:13:04,011 --> 01:13:05,578
THAT'S ALL.

2026
01:13:05,579 --> 01:13:07,080
- YEAH, I'LL BET.

2027

I KNOW CERTAINLY AM.

2029

- IS THAT RIGHT?

2030
01:13:11,986 --> 01:13:16,723
- FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN GIVEN
A SECOND CHANCE AT HAPPINESS.

2031
01:13:16,724 --> 01:13:19,291
- WOW, FORGIVE ME
IF I DON'T SWOON.

2032
01:13:19,292 --> 01:13:21,060
- [chuckles]

2033
01:13:21,061 --> 01:13:22,862
I'M SERIOUS.

01:13:22,863 --> 01:13:23,963
I'M VERY SERIOUS.

SHERRY'S, UM,

01:13:39,579 --> 01:13:44,483
AND YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME.

2040
01:13:44,484 --> 01:13:46,085
- WELL, I'M GLAD DATING

A PSYCHOTIC, OBSESSIVE,
SELF-LOATHING ALCOHOLIC

2042
01:13:49,489 --> 01:13:51,390
MADE YOU APPRECIATE
WHAT WE HAD.

- LISTEN, I KNOW THIS, OKAY?

2044
01:13:55,529 --> 01:13:58,732
I'M A FOOL.

2045
01:13:58,733 --> 01:14:01,434
BUT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IT RIGHT.

2046
01:14:13,447 --> 01:14:14,981

01:14:14,982 --> 01:14:17,183
OH, GOD, WHAT AM I DOING?

2048
01:14:22,456 --> 01:14:25,658

2049
01:14:25,659 --> 01:14:26,659
YOU'RE RIGHT.

2050
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:29,562
LET'S TAKE IT SLOW.

I'LL BE HERE

I'M NOT GOING TO SCREW IT UP
THIS TIME.

2255
01:23:43,683 --> 01:23:44,683
- I FIGURED.

2256
01:23:44,684 --> 01:23:46,519
- OKAY, I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR.

2257
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,721
SO LET ME JUST SET YOU
AND THE STATION

2258
01:23:48,722 --> 01:23:50,723
AND OUR VIEWING AUDIENCE
STRAIGHT ON A FEW THINGS.

2259
01:23:50,724 --> 01:23:53,292
FIRST OF ALL, MY TITLE,
"SASSY WEATHER GIRL,"

2260
01:23:53,293 --> 01:23:54,326
IS INACCURATE.

2261
01:23:54,327 --> 01:23:55,561
I AM NOT A GIRL.

2262
01:23:55,562 --> 01:23:56,629
I AM A WOMAN.

2263
01:23:56,630 --> 01:23:59,231
AND I REALLY
HATE THE WORD "SASSY."

2264
01:23:59,232 --> 01:24:00,232
IT'S STUPID.

2265
01:24:00,233 --> 01:24:01,700
- UH, GO IN TIGHT ON DALE.

2266
01:24:01,701 --> 01:24:03,068
- I MEAN, YES,
I HAVE AN ATTITUDE,

2267
01:24:03,069 --> 01:24:04,202
BUT WOULDN'T YOU,

2268
01:24:04,203 --> 01:24:06,405
IF YOU HAD TO LISTEN
TO DALE WATERS ALL DAY?

2269
01:24:06,406 --> 01:24:07,807
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

2270
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:10,008
WE HAVE A REAL RESPONSIBILITY
TO DELIVER THE NEWS HERE--

2271
01:24:10,009 --> 01:24:11,109
- SHUT UP, DALE.

2272
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:15,347
I AM NOT FINISHED.

2273
01:24:15,348 --> 01:24:17,817
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A TIME
NOT TOO LONG AGO

2274
01:24:17,818 --> 01:24:20,085
WHERE YOU SAT HERE
AND APOLOGIZED FOR ME

2275
01:24:20,086 --> 01:24:21,554
AND MY BEHAVIOR.

2276
01:24:21,555 --> 01:24:22,855
AND NOW IT'S MY TURN.

2277
01:24:22,856 --> 01:24:24,723
- GO IN TIGHTER.

2278
01:24:24,724 --> 01:24:26,692
- I AM SORRY,

2279
01:24:26,693 --> 01:24:30,028
NOT FOR FREAKING OUT THEN
AND NOT FOR FREAKING OUT NOW,

2280
01:24:30,029 --> 01:24:33,065
BUT FOR SELLING OUT,
FOR COMING BACK HERE,

2281
01:24:33,066 --> 01:24:37,102
FOR EVEN CONSIDERING DATING
THIS HORRIBLY INADEQUATE MAN.

2282
01:24:37,103 --> 01:24:38,904
WHEN I--WHEN I GOT THE OFFER
TO COME BACK HERE,

2283
01:24:38,905 --> 01:24:40,906
I COMPROMISED ALL OF MY IDEALS,

2284
01:24:40,907 --> 01:24:45,511
AND I LEFT BEHIND THE ONLY
PEOPLE WHO STOOD BY ME.

2285
01:24:45,512 --> 01:24:49,047
THESE FRIENDS
WERE HONEST WITH ME

2286
01:24:49,048 --> 01:24:51,851
AND WANTED WHAT I SHOULD HAVE:

2287
01:24:51,852 --> 01:24:54,219
TO BE BETTER THAN I WAS.

2288
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:58,323
THEY SAW ME AS MORE
THAN JUST A SASSY WEATHER GIRL,

2289
01:24:58,324 --> 01:24:59,525
AND I BLEW THEM OFF,

2290
01:24:59,526 --> 01:25:01,193
AND I RATIONALIZED IT ALL,

2291
01:25:01,194 --> 01:25:03,496
AND I AM ASHAMED OF MYSELF,

2292
01:25:03,497 --> 01:25:07,099
AND I'M SORRY.

2293
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:09,969
DALE, YOU WERE RIGHT.

2294
01:25:09,970 --> 01:25:12,237
I NEVER LOVED YOU.

2295
01:25:12,238 --> 01:25:15,073
I MEAN, I LOVED THE IDEA OF YOU,

2296
01:25:15,074 --> 01:25:18,878
BUT THE TRUTH IS,
WE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON.

2297
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:28,286
- WELL, THAT WAS SUBTLE.

2298
01:25:28,287 --> 01:25:29,555
- WELL, THAT'S HOW I ROLL.

2299
01:25:29,556 --> 01:25:30,923
- SOME WOULD DESCRIBE IT
AS SASSY.

2300
01:25:30,924 --> 01:25:33,425
- OKAY, NO, IT'S--
NO.

2301
01:25:33,426 --> 01:25:35,360
- LIKE, I'M--
I'M PROUD OF YOU, YOU KNOW?

2302
01:25:35,361 --> 01:25:36,395
- THANK YOU.

2303
01:25:36,396 --> 01:25:37,696
- AND YOU CAN
CRASH WITH ME AGAIN,

2304
01:25:37,697 --> 01:25:39,398
YOU KNOW, NOW THAT YOU'RE
UNEMPLOYED AGAIN.

2305
01:25:39,399 --> 01:25:40,499
- YES, THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

2306
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,934
I HAVE A HUGE SIGNING BONUS
TO REPAY.

2307
01:25:41,935 --> 01:25:43,402
I COULD USE A PLACE TO STAY
FOR A WHILE.

2308
01:25:43,403 --> 01:25:44,737
- GREAT.

2309
01:25:44,738 --> 01:25:46,739
YOU KNOW, YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY
RUIN MY SOCIAL LIFE

2310
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:49,942
ANY MORE THAN YOU ALREADY HAVE,
SO...

2311
01:25:49,943 --> 01:25:51,476
- YOU'RE A GOOD BROTHER.

2312
01:25:51,477 --> 01:25:53,746
- I'M JUST TRYING TO STOP YOU
FROM RUINING THE FAMILY NAME.

2313
01:25:53,747 --> 01:25:55,180
- COULD YOU HAVE ONE
SERIOUS MOMENT?

2314
01:25:55,181 --> 01:25:56,181
- NO.

2315
01:25:56,182 --> 01:25:57,182
- OKAY.

2316
01:25:57,183 --> 01:25:59,117
- OKAY.

2317
01:26:01,721 --> 01:26:02,721
- HEY.

2318
01:26:02,722 --> 01:26:04,890
- HEY.

2319
01:26:04,891 --> 01:26:08,360
UM, HI.

2320
01:26:08,361 --> 01:26:09,962
HEY, WALT.

2321
01:26:09,963 --> 01:26:12,565
- HEY, BYRON.

2322
01:26:14,167 --> 01:26:16,168
- OKAY, UH, SYLVIA,

2323
01:26:16,169 --> 01:26:18,470
I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO YOU,

2324
01:26:18,471 --> 01:26:20,839
AND IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT

2325
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:26,979
AND POTENTIALLY
VERY EMBARRASSING FOR ME, SO...

2326
01:26:28,181 --> 01:26:29,648
- HEY, I'LL JUST
WAIT OUTSIDE, THEN.

2327
01:26:29,649 --> 01:26:30,649
- GOOD.
THANK YOU.

2328
01:26:30,650 --> 01:26:32,350
- COOL.

2329
01:26:33,653 --> 01:26:34,653
- HI.

2330
01:26:34,654 --> 01:26:36,655
- HI, UM...

2331
01:26:36,656 --> 01:26:38,757
I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT,
OKAY?

2332
01:26:38,758 --> 01:26:41,560
I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT
ABOUT YOU AND ME,

2333
01:26:41,561 --> 01:26:44,063
AND I'M THINKING THAT I JUST
NEED TO COME OUT AND TELL YOU

2334
01:26:44,064 --> 01:26:45,831
HOW I FEEL ABOUT--

2335
01:26:53,006 --> 01:26:54,272
- I'M SORRY.

2336
01:26:54,273 --> 01:26:56,842
I WAS SUCH AN IDIOT.

2337
01:26:56,843 --> 01:26:57,943
LOOK, THE TRUTH IS,

2338
01:26:57,944 --> 01:27:00,345
I REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY LIKE YOU.

2339
01:27:00,346 --> 01:27:01,680
I DIDN'T MEAN TO,
BUT I DO.

2340
01:27:01,681 --> 01:27:04,382
AND YOU MEAN MORE TO ME
THAN A RICH GUY

2341
01:27:04,383 --> 01:27:07,820
OR A GROWN-UP GUY
OR A GUY WITH A JOB--

2342
01:27:07,821 --> 01:27:08,821
- I HAVE A JOB.

2343
01:27:08,822 --> 01:27:10,322
- NO, I KNOW YOU DO.

2344
01:27:10,323 --> 01:27:12,891
AND THAT'S NOT--

2345
01:27:12,892 --> 01:27:15,060
THE POINT IS, I--

2346
01:27:15,061 --> 01:27:20,733
YOU MEAN MORE TO ME
THAN ALL OF THOSE THINGS.

2347
01:27:20,734 --> 01:27:24,402
I THINK THAT, UM...

2348
01:27:24,403 --> 01:27:26,438
NO, I DO.

2349
01:27:26,439 --> 01:27:29,908
I LOVE YOU, OKAY?

2350
01:27:29,909 --> 01:27:32,410
I LOVE YOU.

2351
01:27:32,411 --> 01:27:34,980
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

2352
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:42,921
- YOU--YOU FULLY JUST
STOLE MY MOMENT.

2353
01:27:42,922 --> 01:27:44,089
- WHAT?
- NO, I'M SERIOUS.

2354
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:45,791
I WAS READY TO COME DOWN HERE

2355
01:27:45,792 --> 01:27:47,926
AND THROW ALL MY CHIPS
ON THE TABLE, YOU KNOW?

2356
01:27:47,927 --> 01:27:50,262
PREPARE TO GO DOWN
IN FLAMES,

2357
01:27:50,263 --> 01:27:53,966
AND THEN YOU GO AHEAD,
AND YOU STEAL THE WHOLE THING.

2358
01:27:53,967 --> 01:27:56,401
YOU MAKE THAT COOL--
COOL LITTLE SPEECH,

2359
01:27:56,402 --> 01:28:02,407
AND THEN I'M LEFT STANDING HERE
LIKE AN ASSHOLE.

2360
01:28:02,408 --> 01:28:05,778
- WELL, YOU COULD MAKE A SPEECH
IF YOU WANT.

2361
01:28:05,779 --> 01:28:06,779
- AND FOLLOW THAT?

2362
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:07,780
THAT WAS A GREAT SPEECH.

2363
01:28:07,781 --> 01:28:09,247
I CAN'T FOLLOW THAT.

2364
01:28:09,248 --> 01:28:10,683
- SORRY.

2365
01:28:10,684 --> 01:28:13,018
- IT'S OKAY.

2366
01:28:13,019 --> 01:28:17,089
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

2367
01:28:17,090 --> 01:28:19,357
- I KIND OF FEEL THE, UM--

2368
01:28:19,358 --> 01:28:22,294
I LOVE YOU TOO.

2369
01:28:22,295 --> 01:28:24,596
- YOU DO?

2370
01:28:24,597 --> 01:28:28,600
- YOU KNOW I DO.

2371
01:28:28,601 --> 01:28:32,938
NOW, LOOK,
I AM GOING TO GRAB YOU,

2372
01:28:32,939 --> 01:28:35,841
<i>AND I AM GOING TO KISS YOU.</i>

2373
01:28:35,842 --> 01:28:36,842
- OKAY.
- OKAY?

2374
01:28:36,843 --> 01:28:38,476
AND I AM GOING TO TAKE THE LEAD,

2375
01:28:38,477 --> 01:28:40,145
AND YOU ARE GONNA LET ME.

2376
01:28:40,146 --> 01:28:41,479
HERE IT COMES.

2377
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:43,248
ALL RIGHT.

2378
01:28:43,249 --> 01:28:46,018
- YOU CAN DO THAT NOW.
- OKAY.

2379
01:28:47,854 --> 01:28:51,556
- IN ALL, 15 PEOPLES DIED
IN THAT HORRIBLE CRASH.

2380
01:28:53,226 --> 01:28:57,162
AND I'M SURE EVERYONE HERE
THINKS THAT--

2381
01:28:57,163 --> 01:28:58,964
THAT THAT IS TERRIBLE.

2382
01:28:58,965 --> 01:29:03,568
I MEAN, I'LL KEEP A THOUGHT
IN MY HEART

2383
01:29:03,569 --> 01:29:08,673
FOR, UH, THOSE POOR PEOPLE--
FAMILY.

2384
01:29:08,674 --> 01:29:11,043
