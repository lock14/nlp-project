1
00:00:56,757 --> 00:01:01,194
The key is listening to the signals
and hearing what they're saying.

2
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:04,026
If she touches you soft,

3
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:06,498
that's how she wants to be touched.

4
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:09,900
You do that until you can hear her get wet.

5
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,666
You gotta know women. I'm serious.

6
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,833
Last time I went home,
my girl was so grateful,

7
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,007
she went right outside and
started washing my car.

8
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:19,009
Detailed it.

9
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,446
Everything. Just to thank me.

10
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:24,975
Now, we gotta stop talking about pussy

11
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:27,543
'cause if we're not careful,
this is gonna get us killed.

12
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:28,679
Especially in this neighborhood,

13
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,781
and I'm not gonna let pussy get us killed.

14
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,318
Wanna go left?

15
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:35,987
All right, get around this right here.

16
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:37,155
Move left.

17
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,698
Watch it.

18
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,428
Come on, man.
You gotta speed up.

19
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,864
Sarnt, you ever had
two girls at the same...

20
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,269
Go! Go! Go!

21
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:49,809
Go! Go!

22
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,003
Fire! Fire! West!

23
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:52,739
I.E.D. I.E.D. I.E.D.

24
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:55,304
Five points south of Najaf.

25
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:56,314
Third vehicle.

26
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:57,315
We got it.

27
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,113
That was fucked up!

28
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,546
Came right through the door!

29
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:02,748
Shit, that was close.

30
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,381
You all right, sir?

31
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,390
What?

32
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,359
You all right?

33
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:09,055
Yeah.

34
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,154
Sarnt, look.

35
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:11,163
What?

36
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:12,790
Look at your pants, Sir.

37
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:42,158
Did you tell your girlfriend
what happened yet?

38
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,097
No, sir.

39
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:47,564
You're gonna have to tell her.

40
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:50,604
I'll tell her when it's working again, sir.

41
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,231
Okay.

42
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:57,107
But you don't become
functional overnight.

43
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:59,612
You're gonna have to be
patient with yourself.

44
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,841
She's gonna have to be
patient with you.

45
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,181
Can you do that?

46
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:06,617
I guess.

47
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:09,953
All right, then.

48
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:12,857
Good luck to you, Sergeant.

49
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:14,827
Thank you, sir.

50
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:22,261
I've gotta be on there.

51
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:23,701
I don't want to miss this plane.

52
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:24,601
Told you already.

53
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:26,435
- You gotta see the MCNCO.
- Thank you.

54
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,634
- Airport?
- Yeah.

55
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,643
Sergeant T.K. Poole.

56
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:36,149
Listen, buddy, all I want to do
is get back to my wife and kid.

57
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:38,879
- You gotta help me out here.
- I just go by the list.

58
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:40,580
Can I see the list?

59
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,692
Hey. Here it is.

60
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:51,753
Hey.

61
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,397
Sergeant Fred Cheaver.

62
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,231
648. Reserves.

63
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,362
Hello. It's right here.

64
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,872
That's how you spell it?

65
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,532
With a C-H?

66
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,577
How else would you spell Cheaver?

67
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,043
Probably lots of ways.

68
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,171
Not in English.

69
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:11,708
<i>Welcome aboard</i>
<i>Flight 6240 to New York.

70
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:14,310
<i>Our estimated flying time</i>
<i>this evening to JFK

71
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:16,788
<i>will be 8 hours and 20 minutes.

72
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:33,237
Hey.

73
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:34,968
We're all on the same team.

74
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:37,275
You got leave?

75
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,402
Yeah. 30 days.

76
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,741
Oh, yeah?

77
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:40,905
Me, too.

78
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,846
How long you got?

79
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,407
The rest of my life,
thank you very much.

80
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:47,078
My tour's over.

81
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:48,621
I'm going home.

82
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,507
If we go down in the water...

83
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,279
you're gonna be sitting pretty.

84
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,144
What?

85
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,853
I said if we crash in the ocean,
your donut's gonna come in handy.

86
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,122
It'll be like an extra life preserver.

87
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,926
If we crash in the ocean,
it's not gonna matter.

88
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:36,266
Don't talk about planes crashing
when you're on a plane.

89
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:37,634
Why not?

90
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,504
It's basic common sense.

91
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:43,668
It's the same reason
that when you're on a cruise ship,

92
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:44,938
they're not showing <i>Titanic.

93
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,001
It scares people.

94
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:53,176
Who wants to think about
drunk pilots and midair collisions?

95
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,881
Nothing you can do about it, anyway.

96
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:09,532
It's good to be home.

97
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:15,102
We're gonna miss the whole thing.

98
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:18,469
What the hell?

99
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:24,383
<i>Please do not leave</i>
<i>your baggage unattended.

100
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:27,682
<i>All unattended baggage</i>
<i>will be confiscated.

101
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:29,245
Oh, God. I gotta get to Vegas.

102
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:31,348
I can't be sitting around here.

103
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:33,188
You're going to Vegas?

104
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,989
Yeah. I'm going to Vegas.

105
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:38,031
- Hey, are you going to Vegas?
- St. Louis.

106
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:39,360
Excuse me.

107
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:41,924
Do you know what happened here,
why all the flights are cancelled?

108
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,196
There was a blackout here.

109
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,999
The city was dark for five hours.

110
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,302
The lights just came back on
a little while ago.

111
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,403
The lights are back on in the Northeast,

112
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,036
but the planes are still not moving.

113
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:56,241
Airline officials say it could be
at least two days

114
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:58,375
until they get their planes
to the right airports

115
00:06:58,452 --> 00:06:59,578
and resume their schedules.

116
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,678
- Two days.
- Yeah.

117
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,723
They don't know shit.

118
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,850
Supposedly, planes are flying
out of Pittsburgh,

119
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,894
but they can't even get us there
till tomorrow night.

120
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,861
And even that's a big maybe.

121
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,259
Well, it's nice meeting you all.

122
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,561
I'm outta here.

123
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:15,727
Good luck.

124
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:16,735
Where are you goin'?

125
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:19,398
I want to rent a car
before there's none left.

126
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:21,373
It's 14 hours to St. Louis.

127
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:24,741
Drive all night, be there
having dinner with my wife tomorrow.

128
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:27,781
Sure as shit not gonna stay here
while they run out of food and water.

129
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:40,426
Hey, man.

130
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,758
I bet you planes
are flying out of St. Louis.

131
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,593
Probably.

132
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:47,259
Maybe I can catch a flight
to Vegas from there.

133
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:48,767
Me, too.

134
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:54,664
Okay. But we split
everything three ways...

135
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:57,335
gas, rental, insurance, everything.

136
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:59,038
No free rides.

137
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,254
That's it. Sorry. No cars left.

138
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:14,455
You got nothing?

139
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,758
Nothing.

140
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,888
Can you believe this?

141
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,956
Maybe we can call the Army.

142
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,999
The Army?
What's the Army gonna do?

143
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,231
You guys in the Army?

144
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:26,499
Yeah.

145
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:28,640
Were you over there?

146
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,540
Just got back.

147
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,875
Come here.

148
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,278
All right, listen.

149
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,782
I do have one car left.

150
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,182
I'm supposed to hold it
for my boss, but screw it.

151
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:40,277
You guys can have it.

152
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,755
Oh, my God. That's so nice!

153
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:44,756
Thank you!

154
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:45,985
Oh, no.

155
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,526
Thank you.

156
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:05,401
Sure is beautiful.

157
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,172
I guess we don't have time to stop.

158
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:11,444
No. We don't have time to stop.

159
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,783
I never been to New York before.

160
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,017
You been to New York, Sarnt?

161
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,956
I'm stationed at Fort Drum.

162
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:21,619
I've been there a million times.

163
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,629
I thought you were from Las Vegas.

164
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:25,221
No.

165
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:32,929
I'm not from Las Vegas, either.

166
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:35,764
Well, my friend's from there.

167
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:38,140
That's his guitar.

168
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:39,143
Well, it was his guitar.

169
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:43,581
I mean, he got killed,
so I'm just taking it back to his family.

170
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:46,483
That's a real nice thing to be doing.

171
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,973
You must be a good dancer, huh?

172
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,341
Oh, no. My wife's a good dancer.

173
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:15,074
I just try to keep up.

174
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,810
She loves all those Latin dances.

175
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:21,251
Samba, merengue, tango.

176
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,255
She's a looker, huh?

177
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:26,121
Yes, she is. Yeah.

178
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:28,661
What she's doing with someone like me,

179
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:31,129
I'll never know, and I'm not gonna ask.

180
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,598
We're lucky ones, aren't we?

181
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:37,262
We made it through in one piece.

182
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:41,433
I got shot in the leg, but all I gotta do
is put some goo on it, so...

183
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:44,170
Did you get shot... Sarnt?

184
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:47,179
No. I caught a piece of shrapnel.

185
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:49,781
Where?

186
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,613
Outside of Najaf.

187
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:53,915
No. I mean where on your body.

188
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,616
Thigh.

189
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,885
Upper thigh.

190
00:10:58,959 --> 00:10:59,983
How about you, Sarnt?

191
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:04,489
I had back surgery.
Three crushed vertebrae.

192
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:05,690
What happened?

193
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:09,963
Porto John fell on me.

194
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,163
What?

195
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:12,466
Was it full?

196
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,302
No. It was...

197
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:15,739
It was brand-spanking-new.

198
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,299
It was completely sanitary.

199
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,902
We were setting up a camp
outside of Bandar,

200
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,880
and it fell off a forklift.

201
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,540
Well, don't tell the ladies that.

202
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:25,983
You gotta find something
better than that.

203
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,543
You kidding?

204
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:29,714
I love that Porto John.

205
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,758
Best thing that ever happened to me.

206
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,952
A week later, my unit
shipped off to Mosul,

207
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,494
got shot to pieces.

208
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,325
The shitter saved my life.

209
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:41,391
Wish I could've brought it home,
set up a shrine.

210
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:46,998
If I have another kid,
I'm gonna name him Porto John.

211
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:48,666
That's...

212
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:50,505
Porto John Cheaver.

213
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,445
They all look so good.

214
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,319
I don't know what to order.

215
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,756
What can I get for you?

216
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,990
Give me the Number 8, the Number 9,
and the Number 10.

217
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,031
Coffee, orange juice, and milk.

218
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:17,497
Good, huh?

219
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:23,341
I tell you, this woman's smart.

220
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,378
She's got plans for us.

221
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:28,209
You... Can't...
She's dying to get married

222
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:29,578
'cause I'm her ticket to the top.

223
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,640
How are you her ticket to the top?

224
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,743
She's a lieutenant.
She outranks you.

225
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,287
No. Right now she does.

226
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:36,447
I mean, she's got the connections,

227
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,047
but I got the juice.

228
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,616
I mean, it's like a merger between us.

229
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:43,390
You know? She's gonna get me
into Officer Candidate School.

230
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,158
I'm gonna move up the ranks.

231
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:47,097
Then I'm gonna run for office.

232
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,362
And you have to have
a good head of hair to run for office,

233
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,869
and I have a good head of hair.

234
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:55,108
So your fiancée is meeting you in Vegas?

235
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:57,439
No. She's stationed at Fort Dix.

236
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:58,739
I'm gonna meet her there afterwards.

237
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:01,076
Oh, I get it.

238
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:03,048
First, a little fun at the tittie bars.

239
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,584
No. I got business to take care of.

240
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:08,177
You paying back a gambling debt?

241
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:09,244
Wrong again.

242
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:12,919
Randy had a gambling debt.

243
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,255
Yep.

244
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,659
That's why he had to rob Lucky Jim's.

245
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,325
He stole $50,000 so he could
pay back the loan sharks.

246
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,198
But then of course,
the cops got on his tail, and...

247
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,760
and that's when he enlisted.

248
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,305
You know, he just went...

249
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:27,931
went right into the Army
and disappeared.

250
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:29,373
It was the perfect getaway.

251
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:32,673
See, that's exactly
what the Army doesn't want.

252
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,580
The Army's got standards.

253
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,139
Like, it... it means something.

254
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,151
It's not like lowlifes and gangbangers.

255
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:40,277
What?

256
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:42,617
The last thing we need is trash
like your pal Randy.

257
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:44,418
- They don't want...
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

258
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,890
- Whoa!
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

259
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,984
That "trash" saved my fucking life!

260
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:50,291
He pulled me outta that truck
when I got shot!

261
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:53,764
And he took a fucking bullet
in the fucking head!

262
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,735
All I got left is his fucking guitar!

263
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:02,501
Get back in the car.

264
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:03,543
Get back in the car!

265
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,477
I ought to kick your ass!

266
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:07,808
Oh, you're gonna kick my ass.

267
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:10,111
Yeah. I could do it, too.

268
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,310
I'd just push you
down a flight of stairs,

269
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:13,784
punch you in the kidney.

270
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,651
You'd better have eyes
in the back of your head.

271
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:18,088
This is not... We don't have time
for ass-kicking stops.

272
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:20,126
You just say you're sorry,
and let's get going.

273
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,184
- I'm not sorry!
- I'm not talking to you.

274
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,526
- Say you're sorry.
- No. I'm not gonna say I'm sorry.

275
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:27,692
That's like saying I'm sorry
that the sky's blue.

276
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:29,234
Come on, man. You just...

277
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:31,270
You just insulted her dead friend. Huh?

278
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:33,033
Come on. Suck it up.

279
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,334
Say you're sorry. Let's go.

280
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,568
I'm sorry that you got so upset.

281
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:38,509
Okay?

282
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,273
No. That's not an apology.

283
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:41,609
But it's pretty close.

284
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:42,773
Come on, let's go.

285
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:44,976
That's not an apology.

286
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:47,185
Come on. Let me in.

287
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,022
Dude, let me in.

288
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:52,854
I can't.

289
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,860
Just press the key thing, man.

290
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,259
The keys are in the car.

291
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,423
Shit.

292
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,372
What the fuck were you thinking?

293
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:13,572
I was thinking I had two fucking nut cases
throwing shit, getting into a fight.

294
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:15,638
- We didn't fight.
- This is not my fault.

295
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,774
Well, it's sure as shit not our fault.

296
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:19,284
We didn't lock the keys in the car.

297
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,047
Whatever. We need a coat hanger.

298
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:23,214
Coat hanger's not gonna work
on a late model car.

299
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,952
You need a Slim Jim.

300
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:29,154
Well, you know what?
I don't have a Slim Jim.

301
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:43,965
Thank you.

302
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,916
So, they went on this worldwide tour,

303
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:54,283
and they... they got...
'cause they got this contract.

304
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:55,753
And they got to meet the queen,

305
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,380
and they got to meet the president.

306
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,220
And after that,

307
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,955
Randy got the guitar from his daddy,

308
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,792
who got it from his granddaddy,

309
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:07,025
who got it from Elvis.

310
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,260
Elvis.

311
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:09,302
Come on.

312
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:10,927
It's true.

313
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:13,302
That guitar's worth a lot of money.

314
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,694
She's a beaut, don't you think?

315
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,690
Yeah. I already got one, though.

316
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:42,700
- You do?
- Yeah.

317
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,361
Me, too.

318
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,371
That's great. What color?

319
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,805
So, how is it over there?

320
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:52,640
You guys see any action?

321
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:53,804
- Yep.
- Yeah.

322
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,370
Yeah?

323
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,439
Well, we all think
you're doing a hell of a job.

324
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,575
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

325
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,278
No, no. Thank you.

326
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,548
You know, we get clients all the time

327
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:06,023
in the dealership who want
their Hummers outfitted just like yours.

328
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,890
The desert camouflage, the whole bit.

329
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:11,362
One guy even put armor on his H1.

330
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,457
They want bullet holes?

331
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,435
Yeah, they probably do.

332
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:19,028
Hey, check this out.

333
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:21,665
Push that third button right back there.

334
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:23,674
Not bad, huh?

335
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:24,767
Yeah.

336
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,937
Yeah. Bet you guys
don't have that on your vehicles.

337
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:29,648
No, sir, we don't.

338
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,521
You got it?

339
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:43,289
- That didn't take long.
- Thank you.

340
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,580
I have to use the bathroom.

341
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,410
I'll pull over by those bushes.

342
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,544
No, I said "use the bathroom,"

343
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,884
not squat by the side of the road.

344
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:32,741
And the weird and wacky talent
this week is...

345
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:44,788
Congratulations, Wayne.

346
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:58,766
All yours.

347
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,274
Do you want to play pool, or...

348
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:03,775
pinball or something?

349
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:04,935
Nah. We should get going.

350
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:06,444
Okay.

351
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,287
Turn it down!

352
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,294
Turn it off!

353
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,528
Is this a good show?

354
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:31,526
Yeah.

355
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:35,136
I've never seen it before.
Is it new?

356
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,607
Not that new.

357
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,570
I've haven't really seen
much of anything lately

358
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:44,981
'cause I've been overseas
the past 14 months, and...

359
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,541
you know, I'm in the Army.

360
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,354
But I'm home on leave for 30 days,

361
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:52,823
so I'm just... I'm hoping to catch up.

362
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:55,827
I like your jacket.

363
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,262
It's okay.

364
00:19:58,331 --> 00:19:59,730
What's the "I" stand for?

365
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,499
Indiana.

366
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:07,062
You know, the college and the state

367
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,801
where you're standing right now.

368
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,778
Yeah, you know, I was thinking
of going to college when I get out, but...

369
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:15,836
Do you like it?

370
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:18,247
Do you think you could be quiet?

371
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:23,845
Sure, I can be quiet.

372
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:24,947
Good.

373
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:33,031
No way.

374
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,642
You know, I'm limping
because when I was over there,

375
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,085
I got shot in the leg.

376
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:57,748
That wasn't very smart, was it?

377
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:59,519
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

378
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:09,224
Back off! Back off!

379
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:10,269
What's wrong with you guys?

380
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:11,598
Back off!

381
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,038
Calm down.

382
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,574
No, that's right. Be afraid.

383
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,200
No, be very afraid.

384
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:18,266
Go, go, go!

385
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:19,276
All right!

386
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:29,983
Yeah! We won!

387
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:31,853
Kicked their college asses!

388
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,653
Kicked their college asses!

389
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:36,991
Oh, this girl's crazy.

390
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:39,391
Yeah.

391
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,091
Just glad I didn't have my weapon.

392
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,481
TV! TV! TV!

393
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:12,257
- I wish we had some booze.
- Yeah.

394
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:14,630
Check my bag.

395
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:17,499
Doctor in Germany gave me
a bottle of schnapps.

396
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:25,976
And a tough night here at the arena
for the home team.

397
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,637
- Thank you.
- All right.

398
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:37,790
Not bad.

399
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:41,890
I mean, what you really want
after a fight is whiskey

400
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:43,826
'cause it mellows you out.

401
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:47,127
If you want to get mean, you drink gin,

402
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,169
vodka if you want to zone out,

403
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:52,261
and you save tequila
for when you want to get crazy.

404
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:54,929
She didn't need tequila tonight.

405
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:00,742
Did anybody see a straw around here?

406
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:03,340
No. Why?

407
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:04,906
'Cause if you drink through a straw,

408
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:06,815
it gets you drunker.

409
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:07,875
That's not true.

410
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:09,148
Of course it is.

411
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:10,154
That's ridiculous.

412
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:13,123
How could that be true?

413
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:16,184
Well, I don't really know how it works.

414
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:18,355
It just... It...

415
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:20,661
It just gets in...
It just goes in faster.

416
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,860
Oh, it's just one of...

417
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:24,402
one of the mysteries of life?

418
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,438
- Is that what you're saying?
- Uh-huh.

419
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,671
Shit, man.

420
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:07,373
You okay?

421
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:10,775
I was...

422
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:14,149
You know.

423
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,251
Sorry.

424
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:27,963
Honey, it's me.

425
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:29,365
You there?

426
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:31,369
Pick up.

427
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:34,966
Okay. Well, we got held up a little bit,

428
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:38,010
but we'll be rolling in
in about two hours or so.

429
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:47,052
Is that the Mississippi?

430
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,484
That's it.

431
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:53,425
I always wanted to go
on one of those riverboats.

432
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:56,087
You know?
Do you think maybe we could stop?

433
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,493
No.

434
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,154
Pat!

435
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:30,790
Pat!

436
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:42,002
Honey! I'm home!

437
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:47,568
Honey?

438
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,781
Sure you got the right house?

439
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:55,150
Yeah.

440
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,587
Can't believe your own dog
doesn't know you.

441
00:25:57,657 --> 00:26:00,182
We don't have a dog.

442
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:13,530
Yes, sir.

443
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:17,098
You have a good life here, Cheaver.

444
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,016
There you are.

445
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,088
Fred.

446
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:40,091
You're home.

447
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:48,773
I missed you.

448
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:53,870
God, I missed you.

449
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:57,913
Let me get the dog to stop.

450
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:01,414
Whose dog is that?

451
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:03,911
Mine.

452
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:07,218
No, no, no.

453
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,693
Pogo, you come with me.
Yes. You come with me.

454
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:11,389
Yes. Yes. Yes.

455
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,523
I'm gonna put you in here for a while.

456
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,794
Yes, I know. I'm sorry.

457
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:17,267
Mommy loves you.

458
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:22,663
So.

459
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:27,101
Where you been all my life?

460
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:30,278
How's your back?

461
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:32,783
It's fine.

462
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:34,717
Doesn't matter now.

463
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:36,311
Scott spent the night at Brad's house.

464
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:38,619
He should be back soon.

465
00:27:38,691 --> 00:27:39,885
Great.

466
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,789
Where are your friends?

467
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,657
They're out back.

468
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:48,432
Don't you think we should get them?

469
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:49,729
Well, sure. Yeah.

470
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:51,360
- Let 'em in.
- Okay.

471
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:57,370
Welcome.

472
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,448
Can I get you something to drink?

473
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:04,847
Yeah.

474
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:07,719
Do you want one, Fred?

475
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:09,618
No. Thanks.

476
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:14,655
Well, I bet you're all glad to be back.

477
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:16,422
- Yeah.
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

478
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,892
Excuse me for a minute.

479
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:30,299
Sit down.

480
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:43,987
So.

481
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,853
How are you?

482
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:48,120
Fine.

483
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:50,856
Are you sure?

484
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:51,862
Is anything wrong?

485
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:53,922
No. Nothing.

486
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:57,466
Something's wrong.

487
00:28:57,536 --> 00:28:59,163
I don't see you

488
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:02,969
for almost two years, and then...

489
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:05,976
I don't know.

490
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:08,104
Well...

491
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,772
I don't know, either.

492
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:16,684
Well, I guess they say that...

493
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:19,816
you know, that...

494
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:22,326
it's difficult at first, and...

495
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:24,692
I'm sorry. I jus... I really am.

496
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:26,026
I just can't do this.

497
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,192
Everyone told me to wait,
but I don't see the point.

498
00:29:30,503 --> 00:29:32,403
You know me.
I'm no good at pretending.

499
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:34,531
Pretending about what?

500
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:37,366
Fred, you're not gonna like this.

501
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:39,401
Okay.

502
00:29:40,713 --> 00:29:42,010
Okay.

503
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:47,245
I think I w...

504
00:29:49,088 --> 00:29:50,885
I need a divorce.

505
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:52,889
What?

506
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,585
I'm sorry.

507
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,629
But to go around pretending
for a week that it's not true,

508
00:29:57,696 --> 00:29:59,288
well, that didn't seem fair to you, either.

509
00:29:59,365 --> 00:30:01,856
Wait a minute...

510
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:04,596
I come home, and...

511
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,467
Why do...
Why do you want a divorce?

512
00:30:10,543 --> 00:30:12,943
I didn't plan it this way.

513
00:30:13,012 --> 00:30:15,139
It just happened. You were gone.

514
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:18,183
I'm sorry, but I've moved on.

515
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:20,746
You gotta be kidding.

516
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,118
I got a new job, and I'm finally happy.

517
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:25,488
Finally happy? What...

518
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:27,458
You mean you weren't...
you weren't happy before?

519
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:29,391
Well, I guess I was. I don't know.

520
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:31,019
I... I...

521
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:36,301
You seeing someone else?

522
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:39,132
- No.
- You can tell me.

523
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:41,196
I'm not seeing anyone else.

524
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:42,934
I don't want to see anyone else.

525
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,135
I'm happy being alone.

526
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:47,577
I want to be alone.

527
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:50,945
I know that sounds harsh,
but it's the truth.

528
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,984
I am happy.

529
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:57,121
Without you.

530
00:30:58,224 --> 00:31:00,658
Oh, my God.

531
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:02,990
This is what makes a guy flip out.

532
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:05,657
He's gonna strangle her.

533
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:08,165
If it were you,
you wouldn't strangle her.

534
00:31:08,234 --> 00:31:10,065
Okay.

535
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:12,763
Shoot her. Whatever.

536
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:21,336
Hey.

537
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:22,971
- What's up?
- Hi.

538
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,016
Who are you?

539
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:27,018
Friends of your dad.

540
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:28,986
My dad?

541
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,578
- He's...
- Scott.

542
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:34,788
Dad!

543
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,795
It's good to see you.

544
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,724
Wow! Look at you.

545
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:49,301
How are you?

546
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,536
I'm good.

547
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,477
How are you?

548
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:57,978
Just great.

549
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,347
So.

550
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,079
Did Mom tell you?

551
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:03,985
Yeah.

552
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:05,182
You surprised?

553
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:08,487
Yeah.

554
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,423
Can you believe it?

555
00:32:12,498 --> 00:32:14,523
Stanford.

556
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,465
- What?
- I got into Stanford.

557
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:17,627
What?

558
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:18,795
Yeah, I got in!

559
00:32:18,871 --> 00:32:20,168
You got into...

560
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:21,228
I got into Stanford.

561
00:32:21,307 --> 00:32:22,672
Oh, yeah!

562
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:25,039
Oh, my... Yes! All right!

563
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,509
- I did it.
- I knew you could do it!

564
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:28,842
Yeah, and I got a scholarship
that'll pay for half the tuition.

565
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:31,212
- Fantastic.
- And I made six grand working this year.

566
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:34,446
- Excellent.
- And I need $20,000 to pay for the rest.

567
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:37,350
That's not so great.

568
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:40,449
Well, I told him I'm not sure
we can come up with the $20,000.

569
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:44,723
It's doable.

570
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:47,630
I'll just get my old job back,
and if we have to,

571
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,565
we'll take a second mortgage
on the house.

572
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:51,398
We have a second mortgage already.

573
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:55,600
Well, then we'll sell
the fucking house, all right?

574
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:59,235
Okay. Well, it took the Schneiders
two years to sell theirs.

575
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:02,405
I need the money in three weeks
or I lose my place.

576
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,574
I'll get you the money.

577
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:05,810
I promise.

578
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:11,051
Can I talk to you?

579
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:16,522
What are we doing here?
We should be focused on Scott.

580
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:17,619
I am focused on Scott.

581
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:20,824
We gotta make sure we can do this for him,
pool our resources, whatever it takes.

582
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:24,460
Why do you need a divorce right now?
I just don't get it.

583
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:25,901
I'm sorry, Fred.

584
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:27,802
But this is what I want to do.

585
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:29,363
Now, I've had some papers drawn up,

586
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:33,207
and I just want to stick to the plan.

587
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:48,255
Listen. We're gonna keep it together.

588
00:33:48,327 --> 00:33:50,124
We're gonna stay calm.

589
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:53,892
Look, there's no killing yourself
or anyone else, okay?

590
00:33:53,966 --> 00:33:55,228
Hey, you're gonna get through this.

591
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,324
All right? Do you hear me?

592
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,338
This is fine right here.

593
00:34:09,415 --> 00:34:10,973
Here you go.

594
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,142
Cheaver.

595
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:15,244
Cheaver.

596
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,584
Come on, what's your plan?

597
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:19,988
I'll take you guys to the airport

598
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:22,152
and then I'm gonna drive
straight to Salt Lake,

599
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,216
see my brother.

600
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,788
I'm not going back home.

601
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:28,196
I can tell you that much.

602
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:30,132
What about your kid?

603
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:33,501
I'll figure something out.

604
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,267
Your brother should lend you the money.

605
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,707
My brother is in Debtors Anonymous.

606
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,007
Fred?

607
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:44,505
I thought that was you.
You're back.

608
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:45,515
Hey, Carl.

609
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:46,778
- Hi.
- What's up?

610
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:47,819
How'd it go over there?

611
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:49,478
Great.

612
00:34:49,555 --> 00:34:50,886
You know, it went great.

613
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:52,253
Well, we all missed you...

614
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:53,518
you know, seeing you every day.

615
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:55,618
Well, I'm coming back.

616
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:57,218
I'm just gonna take a few days off,

617
00:34:57,296 --> 00:34:59,355
and then it's nose-to-the-grindstone time.

618
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,365
I gotta earn some money.

619
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,491
Yeah.

620
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:05,469
But, you know,
since Alan's been in charge,

621
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:07,471
he's just been running
the company into the ground,

622
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:09,700
and then that lawsuit...
you heard about that.

623
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:11,242
No.

624
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:15,111
Already laid off 60 guys, including me.

625
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,639
Shit.

626
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:21,049
They're shutting down
the whole place next month, so...

627
00:35:22,054 --> 00:35:23,043
Fuck.

628
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,557
Yeah.

629
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,590
Fuck!

630
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:34,393
- Hey!
- Fuck!

631
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:35,660
Oh, my goodness.

632
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:36,996
Fuck!

633
00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:38,627
Okay, there's no need for that.

634
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,000
Take good care of yourself.

635
00:35:46,078 --> 00:35:47,705
Don't drive straight through, okay?

636
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:48,905
You'll get into a wreck.

637
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:50,915
Not a bad idea.

638
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,245
What?

639
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,285
Catch a telephone pole going 90.

640
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:56,854
Collect some life insurance money.

641
00:35:56,922 --> 00:35:57,911
No, no, no.

642
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,218
No, no. Forget that.

643
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:00,849
'Cause insurance doesn't pay for suicide.

644
00:36:00,926 --> 00:36:03,224
Yeah. Not if it's an accident.

645
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:06,059
- Enough with the crazy talk, please.
- Yeah.

646
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:07,359
- You're not being serious...
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

647
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:08,990
- Okay, good. Good.
- It's just a joke.

648
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:10,591
Yeah, have a nice flight.

649
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:13,103
And good luck to you.

650
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:15,231
- All right.
- Drive safe.

651
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,235
- You're on the wrong side, pal.
- Yeah, I know.

652
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:55,678
You know what?
It's all right, 'cause I'm driving anyway.

653
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:57,977
What?

654
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,244
We're coming with you.

655
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:00,808
- No, you're not.
- Yep.

656
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:01,978
Of course we are.

657
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:03,351
- No, you're not. You got a...
- Yes.

658
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:04,889
You have a flight to catch.

659
00:37:04,957 --> 00:37:06,822
We'll fly out of Salt Lake City.

660
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:08,416
I feel pathetic enough, all right?

661
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:10,791
Crying don't mean you're pathetic, okay?

662
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:12,762
I'm fine.

663
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:13,798
Yeah, you're great.

664
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:15,162
That's why we're coming with you.

665
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:17,566
We want to meet your whole family.

666
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,341
This is what you gotta do.

667
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:32,645
Okay, Cheaver, you gotta get
your finances in order.

668
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:34,242
All right, you buy a house,

669
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:36,310
you gotta have an exit plan.

670
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:38,049
You gotta know how
you're gonna sell it.

671
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,016
You're right.

672
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:43,561
Hey, easy there, cowboy.

673
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,920
It's for my back.

674
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,794
So what you gotta do

675
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:52,735
is buy an apartment house, rent it out,

676
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:54,203
live in the basement for free.

677
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:57,208
Six months later, you borrow on it
and buy another one.

678
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:01,343
Am I still living in the basement?

679
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:02,744
Absolutely.

680
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:04,875
Take a left.

681
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,679
You can get around this.

682
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:12,555
Yeah, a man's gotta be indispensable.

683
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,650
You want to move up in the world,
you gotta have skills.

684
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:17,126
Basic skills.

685
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:18,628
Yeah, what are your skills?

686
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:20,221
Leadership.

687
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:21,891
I'm a leader.

688
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,434
Me, too.

689
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:25,094
No, you're a private.

690
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,536
That's the opposite of a leader.

691
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:29,073
You know computer?

692
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:30,699
Yeah, kinda.

693
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:34,177
You're at a disadvantage
if you don't master computer skills.

694
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,075
You gotta build on that.

695
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:41,119
Learn a new word every day, and...

696
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:42,881
get comfortable with it.

697
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,989
Do you know where you're going here?

698
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:51,059
I got a sense of it.

699
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:53,563
I think you might be making your way
around to the east.

700
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:56,056
No. I'm good.

701
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:57,601
Cheaver, we going the right wa...

702
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,602
Do you think he's okay?

703
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,108
He took a ton of those pills.

704
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:08,336
Cheaver!

705
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:11,543
Wake up, man!

706
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:14,315
Cheaver!

707
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:19,547
Come on, man! Wake up!

708
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:21,455
T.K., watch it!

709
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,458
Oh, my God.

710
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:30,933
Holy shit!

711
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:35,606
Oh, my God.

712
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:36,971
Are you all right?

713
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:42,142
Yeah.

714
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,448
Oh, my God, T.K., you're so lucky.

715
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:50,317
Yeah, well...

716
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:52,118
I'm a lucky guy.

717
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:58,990
What the hell were you doing, T. K?

718
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:00,861
- He stopped short.
- It was a red light.

719
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:02,399
It was a red light.

720
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:05,294
There's nothing I could do.
He stopped...

721
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,338
I can't fucking afford it!

722
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:09,840
Hey, guys.

723
00:40:12,144 --> 00:40:13,736
I think it opened up.

724
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:18,573
Come on, keep pressure on it.

725
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:25,084
They said a left at Templeton.

726
00:40:25,157 --> 00:40:26,954
Did you see Templeton?

727
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:32,154
There it is.

728
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:38,725
What the hell?

729
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:42,172
We need a doctor.

730
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,265
Well, the doctor isn't in till 3:00,

731
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:45,639
so you're gonna have to wait.

732
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,575
Oh, it can't wait.
Is there a nurse?

733
00:40:47,646 --> 00:40:48,874
No.

734
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:49,879
You know what?

735
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:50,880
I'm gonna treat her myself.

736
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:51,881
What do you mean?

737
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,713
I'm a doctor. An Army medic.

738
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,685
You can't just go in there!

739
00:40:56,755 --> 00:40:57,983
You have to wait!

740
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,124
Yikes.

741
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,326
Here, you're gonna
have to take off your pants.

742
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:10,925
Yeah.

743
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:19,809
- Does that hurt?
- It's okay.

744
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:29,613
Have you ever done this before?

745
00:41:30,956 --> 00:41:32,924
No.

746
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:36,825
But sometimes you gotta put things out

747
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:38,556
just to get things done, you know?

748
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:41,723
Mm-hmm.

749
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:43,701
You're gonna be fine.

750
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,069
Hey, thanks.

751
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:52,507
No problem.

752
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:59,776
Hey, you mind if I use your phone?

753
00:42:05,457 --> 00:42:06,389
Hey, babe.

754
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:07,482
Sorry I missed you,

755
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:09,891
and I do miss you,

756
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:15,490
but I'm gonna be
another day or two, so...

757
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:16,591
I love you. Okay.

758
00:42:16,668 --> 00:42:18,226
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

759
00:42:27,746 --> 00:42:30,146
How you doing, Cheaver?

760
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,142
I'm okay.

761
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:35,243
Yeah, you gotta give us those pills.

762
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,651
We're not gonna let you off yourself.

763
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:43,225
If you kill yourself, Cheaver,
do you know where you go?

764
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:48,087
Hell?

765
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:50,663
Worse.

766
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:52,362
The Lake of Fire.

767
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:53,369
Lake of Fire?

768
00:42:53,438 --> 00:42:54,370
Yeah.

769
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:55,770
You don't want to go there.

770
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:00,067
I feel like I'm in it.

771
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,914
Hello.

772
00:43:03,982 --> 00:43:05,040
Theodore?

773
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:06,606
Yeah.

774
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:08,619
I think it's your girlfriend.

775
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:11,247
Hey, baby. How are you?

776
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:13,948
No. No.

777
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:15,583
No, the other guy got shot in the leg.

778
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,128
He's the one whose wife left him,
so we're driving him to Salt Lake City,

779
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:20,187
and then I'm going right home.
Okay, babe?

780
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:24,000
No, I'm with two guys.

781
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,030
All right. Well, let...

782
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:30,006
Let me call you back, okay?

783
00:43:30,075 --> 00:43:31,906
I love you, too, baby.

784
00:43:31,977 --> 00:43:34,207
Okay. All right. Bye.

785
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:39,948
Oh, my Lord. You're one good liar.

786
00:43:40,018 --> 00:43:42,350
You know that?

787
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,251
But just so you know,
that's not a good thing.

788
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:46,017
That just makes you a big phony.

789
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:47,718
Well, most of what I said was true.

790
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50,761
Except you forgot the part
about the tittie bars.

791
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:52,456
That's 'cause I'm not going
to a tittie bar.

792
00:43:53,498 --> 00:43:56,433
Seems to me if you can't tell
your soul mate the truth,

793
00:43:56,501 --> 00:43:58,560
then maybe she's not
really your soul mate.

794
00:43:58,637 --> 00:44:01,231
I didn't say she was my soul mate.

795
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:03,604
If Randy lied to me...

796
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:08,337
I'd take that guitar,

797
00:44:08,413 --> 00:44:11,610
and I would bust it over his head
and the damn lap dancers, too.

798
00:44:11,683 --> 00:44:13,275
There's no lap dancer!

799
00:44:14,285 --> 00:44:16,253
Okay, so tell her the truth.

800
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:18,221
Why can't you just tell her the truth?

801
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:19,688
Forget it. Just...

802
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:20,690
I don't get it.

803
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:22,386
What's the big problem?

804
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,519
- The big problem?
- Yeah.

805
00:44:24,596 --> 00:44:26,723
Is that I got wounded in the dick.
That's the big problem.

806
00:44:26,798 --> 00:44:27,958
What?

807
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:30,193
But I thought you said...

808
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:31,826
Yeah, and it doesn't work.

809
00:44:31,903 --> 00:44:34,394
I can't get it up.
Okay? You happy?

810
00:44:34,472 --> 00:44:36,269
No.

811
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:38,637
Why are you going to Vegas?

812
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:41,907
I got the name of a place in Vegas
where they got real pros,

813
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,914
and I'm gonna see if they can get me hard.

814
00:44:43,982 --> 00:44:45,210
Hookers?

815
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:47,410
No. High-end girls who know
how to handle special cases.

816
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:49,917
Why don't you let your fiancée do it?

817
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:51,956
Because she doesn't know
where I'm wounded.

818
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:54,753
She's not gonna be interested
if she knows I'm not working right.

819
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:56,794
- No. You don't know that.
- Yeah, I do know that.

820
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,226
You gotta give her a chance.

821
00:44:58,296 --> 00:45:01,527
If it's not working,
she and I got nothing to talk about.

822
00:45:03,702 --> 00:45:04,964
Well...

823
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:08,130
even if it doesn't work,
you can still pleasure her.

824
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:09,138
That's true.

825
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:12,301
Yep. He can do threesomes.

826
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:13,503
With another girl.

827
00:45:13,578 --> 00:45:14,738
No, another guy.

828
00:45:14,813 --> 00:45:19,045
The guy does it with T.K.'s fiancée
while T.K. watches.

829
00:45:19,117 --> 00:45:20,516
- Just...
- Colee...

830
00:45:20,585 --> 00:45:22,883
Or you can use a vibrator.

831
00:45:22,954 --> 00:45:25,514
They make 'em real lifelike these days.

832
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,421
You can even strap it on,

833
00:45:27,492 --> 00:45:29,983
or, you know, they can put
this thing inside your penis.

834
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:34,794
It's like a balloon, and all you gotta do
is just pump it, pump it up.

835
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:35,798
- Colee?
- Yeah?

836
00:45:35,867 --> 00:45:37,061
Enough.

837
00:45:37,135 --> 00:45:39,933
Well, it's just about
how much you love her.

838
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:50,605
Rent-a-car folks gave me
the go-ahead, so I can do it.

839
00:45:50,682 --> 00:45:53,116
But there are about five jobs ahead of you.

840
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:55,209
- Shit.
- All right.

841
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:28,678
So, what are you doing after Vegas?

842
00:46:28,753 --> 00:46:30,345
Gonna go see your mom or...

843
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:32,389
I haven't spoke to my mom
in three years.

844
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:33,788
No?

845
00:46:35,827 --> 00:46:37,021
Why not?

846
00:46:37,095 --> 00:46:39,427
She kicked me out
of the house when I was 16.

847
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:41,965
Wanted to spend more alone time
with her boyfriend.

848
00:46:47,038 --> 00:46:49,268
The only people
I really want to talk to now

849
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,399
are Randy's family.

850
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:54,001
I'm gonna stay with them from now on.

851
00:46:54,078 --> 00:46:57,809
Well, you can use my phone,
tell them we're running late.

852
00:46:57,882 --> 00:46:59,679
No, that's okay.

853
00:46:59,751 --> 00:47:01,616
They don't even know I'm coming.

854
00:47:04,956 --> 00:47:05,980
They don't?

855
00:47:06,057 --> 00:47:07,888
Nope.

856
00:47:17,035 --> 00:47:19,868
You know that family
Colee's bringing the guitar to?

857
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:26,169
She thinks she's gonna live with them.

858
00:47:26,244 --> 00:47:28,109
They're gonna be her family.

859
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:31,876
That girl's living in a dream world.

860
00:47:34,252 --> 00:47:36,117
Plus she's got no skills.

861
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,069
Thanks.

862
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:05,882
Looks good.

863
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,214
Where's Colee?

864
00:48:08,286 --> 00:48:09,344
I don't know.

865
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,354
- That girl you were with?
- Yeah.

866
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:13,583
I think she went across
the street to the church.

867
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:33,509
Can I help you?

868
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:36,411
We're just looking for someone.

869
00:48:36,481 --> 00:48:38,244
Are you friends of Colee?

870
00:48:38,316 --> 00:48:40,546
- Yeah.
- She told me to look out for you.

871
00:48:40,618 --> 00:48:42,245
Just come this way.

872
00:48:47,992 --> 00:48:51,484
He stopped me and then he said,
"What do you do?

873
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:55,225
"What do I do?"
"What business are you in?"

874
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:59,236
And it's funny 'cause I always say,
"Well, I'm in the love business."

875
00:49:01,372 --> 00:49:03,237
And don't you know the Lord himself

876
00:49:03,308 --> 00:49:07,335
is chairman of the board
of this love business.

877
00:49:07,412 --> 00:49:09,471
Think about it.

878
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:12,072
He is, isn't he?

879
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:15,051
And so then, you've got to ask yourself,

880
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,848
don't you want to be
in business with the Lord?

881
00:49:16,921 --> 00:49:19,116
Hey! Come on in.

882
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:20,953
I know I sure do.

883
00:49:21,025 --> 00:49:22,652
'Cause the Lord takes responsibility

884
00:49:22,727 --> 00:49:24,354
even when you make mistakes,
doesn't he?

885
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:25,726
He's really good, isn't he?

886
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:28,561
That's what I call a good C.E.O.

887
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:32,034
Now, in the spirit of our Lord,
who died for our sins,

888
00:49:32,103 --> 00:49:34,230
let's reach out to each other
with a greeting of peace.

889
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:38,036
Peace be with you.

890
00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:40,304
- We should get out of here.
- Yeah, I know.

891
00:49:40,378 --> 00:49:41,845
Peace be with you.

892
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:47,415
Now remember the folks behind you, too.

893
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:50,249
- Don't be shy.
- Peace be with you.

894
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:51,652
And if any of you are troubled,

895
00:49:51,723 --> 00:49:55,659
I encourage you to speak out.

896
00:49:55,727 --> 00:49:57,558
Testify.

897
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:02,531
I'm hoping you can pray for us.

898
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:07,060
We're soldiers home on leave,
and my friends here are troubled.

899
00:50:07,138 --> 00:50:09,834
Cheaver has a very bad back
and a broken marriage

900
00:50:09,907 --> 00:50:12,603
and he wants to take his own life.

901
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:14,838
And T.K.'s wounded
in the private parts,

902
00:50:14,912 --> 00:50:17,881
which is why he's lying to his fiancée
about going to whores.

903
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:26,387
Thank you, sister.

904
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:27,651
Lord, bring your healing touch

905
00:50:27,725 --> 00:50:29,249
to Sister Margaret's arthritis...

906
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:33,687
and give her daughter strength and faith

907
00:50:33,765 --> 00:50:36,256
in the final days of her pregnancy.

908
00:50:36,334 --> 00:50:37,665
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

909
00:50:39,637 --> 00:50:41,127
And be sure to say a prayer...

910
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:42,194
Please stand, sir.

911
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:46,536
Get up.

912
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:48,078
It's your turn.

913
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,052
Lord, help these soldiers,

914
00:50:58,122 --> 00:51:01,523
who have given so much for this country.

915
00:51:01,592 --> 00:51:05,722
Ease the burden of pain
from Brother Cheaver's back

916
00:51:05,797 --> 00:51:07,992
and heal his broken spirit.

917
00:51:08,066 --> 00:51:09,363
Amen.

918
00:51:09,434 --> 00:51:11,629
And for Brother T.K., make his wounded...

919
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:14,330
whole again.

920
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,339
Amen.

921
00:51:21,813 --> 00:51:23,872
You soldiers from Kansas City?

922
00:51:23,948 --> 00:51:25,711
No, sir.
We're just passing through.

923
00:51:25,783 --> 00:51:27,410
Well, I hope you're hungry.

924
00:51:27,485 --> 00:51:29,316
We're having quite a shindig tonight.

925
00:51:29,387 --> 00:51:30,718
Happens to be my birthday.

926
00:51:30,788 --> 00:51:32,119
Happy Birthday.

927
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:33,589
That's very nice of you but...

928
00:51:33,658 --> 00:51:37,150
I'm Stan Tilson, and you don't need
to be polite about it.

929
00:51:37,228 --> 00:51:40,163
I want you folks to come and that's it.

930
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:46,728
We don't have time for this.

931
00:51:46,804 --> 00:51:50,171
Well, you can't say no
to that kind of invitation.

932
00:51:50,241 --> 00:51:52,038
Half of healing is fellowship.

933
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,943
We'll have a quick bite
and be on our way.

934
00:52:03,187 --> 00:52:05,883
Ah, welcome, welcome.

935
00:52:05,957 --> 00:52:07,481
Now, we don't start for a little while,

936
00:52:07,558 --> 00:52:10,220
but you folks make yourselves
right at home.

937
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:14,697
What are those?

938
00:52:14,765 --> 00:52:16,289
Lobster.

939
00:52:18,069 --> 00:52:19,696
Big lobster.

940
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:22,170
- Ask her for umbrellas.
- How many chairs do we need?

941
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,767
I've got five set up here,
so I need to get a few more.

942
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:28,676
Give me a hand right here.

943
00:52:29,747 --> 00:52:33,080
This guy's got some serious dough.

944
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,345
Happy Birthday.

945
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:41,056
Would you care for some stuffed endive?

946
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:45,255
No, thank you.

947
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:48,162
It really is. The place looks fabulous.

948
00:52:48,232 --> 00:52:51,668
I work for my dad.
I work in commodities.

949
00:52:51,736 --> 00:52:52,760
- Really?
- Yeah.

950
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:54,634
Cool. Yeah, my dad's a drill instructor.

951
00:52:54,705 --> 00:52:56,900
Yeah, I got a brother stationed in Korea

952
00:52:56,974 --> 00:53:00,307
and another brother
who's in basic training.

953
00:53:00,378 --> 00:53:02,312
So your whole family's in the Army?

954
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,712
Yeah. I mean, just about.
You know, my mom's not.

955
00:53:04,782 --> 00:53:06,807
Our whole family is in finance.

956
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:08,010
- Cool.
- Yeah.

957
00:53:08,085 --> 00:53:10,383
These are the soldiers that Dad invited.

958
00:53:10,454 --> 00:53:11,614
This is my brother Peter.

959
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,486
Right. Welcome home.

960
00:53:13,558 --> 00:53:15,150
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

961
00:53:15,226 --> 00:53:17,251
No, thank you.

962
00:53:17,328 --> 00:53:20,024
It's a big mess over there, isn't it?

963
00:53:20,097 --> 00:53:21,758
Well, of course it is. It's a war.

964
00:53:21,832 --> 00:53:23,163
War is messy.

965
00:53:23,234 --> 00:53:25,099
It can't be all perfect.

966
00:53:25,169 --> 00:53:26,261
How would you know?

967
00:53:26,337 --> 00:53:27,463
Well, how would you know, Peter?

968
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:29,836
We don't exactly see you over there.

969
00:53:29,907 --> 00:53:32,603
But I'm not for the war.

970
00:53:32,677 --> 00:53:34,110
I don't think it's a great thing.

971
00:53:34,178 --> 00:53:36,271
Neither do I.

972
00:53:36,347 --> 00:53:37,644
Since when?

973
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:39,273
I can change my mind, can't I?

974
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:40,339
Like everybody else.

975
00:53:40,418 --> 00:53:42,648
Yeah, go ahead, change your mind.

976
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,018
But these guys are stuck over there.

977
00:53:45,089 --> 00:53:47,523
That's not the point, Peter.
I mean, you don't get it.

978
00:53:47,592 --> 00:53:48,752
You just don't get it.

979
00:53:48,826 --> 00:53:51,090
You can't change your minds, can you?

980
00:53:51,162 --> 00:53:53,562
You can't just leave?

981
00:53:53,631 --> 00:53:55,155
No, not really.

982
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:57,497
We do get some R&R.

983
00:53:57,568 --> 00:54:00,196
These guys are screwed and for what?

984
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:01,363
- Guys...
- For what?

985
00:54:01,439 --> 00:54:03,304
Can we just argue about golf, please?

986
00:54:03,374 --> 00:54:05,103
There's a lot at stake over there, Peter.

987
00:54:05,176 --> 00:54:06,575
Yeah, a lot of money.

988
00:54:06,644 --> 00:54:08,612
Barbara, what's the name of that woman

989
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:10,579
who's always trying to get
that Saturday morning tea time?

990
00:54:10,648 --> 00:54:12,445
- Angela Morton.
- Right.

991
00:54:12,516 --> 00:54:14,040
That's her big cause.

992
00:54:14,118 --> 00:54:16,882
What do you really think we're fighting for?

993
00:54:16,954 --> 00:54:20,014
What are you doing over there?

994
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:22,559
Honestly, we're just trying to stay alive.

995
00:54:22,627 --> 00:54:24,788
Stay alive?

996
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:26,352
I bet that's not too easy.

997
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,125
Stay alive? Jesus Christ.

998
00:54:28,199 --> 00:54:30,190
If that's your attitude,
no wonder we're losing.

999
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:31,530
Bob!

1000
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:33,001
Hey, that's nice.

1001
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,095
Well, I don't have to listen to this crap.

1002
00:54:35,172 --> 00:54:36,537
- Come on.
- No, but you just...

1003
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:38,666
Can't you just shut up for once?

1004
00:54:38,743 --> 00:54:41,906
- What?
- You always do this.

1005
00:54:41,979 --> 00:54:42,911
I'm sorry.

1006
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:43,969
It's okay.

1007
00:54:44,048 --> 00:54:44,980
It's fine.

1008
00:54:45,049 --> 00:54:47,415
Parties are supposed to be fun.

1009
00:54:51,756 --> 00:54:54,486
White wine, please.

1010
00:54:56,861 --> 00:54:59,022
So you're a soldier, huh?

1011
00:55:00,498 --> 00:55:02,022
Used to be.

1012
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:04,727
You saw a lot?

1013
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,736
Enough.

1014
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:10,638
So they have girls in the military now?

1015
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:12,335
Yes, ma'am.

1016
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:13,934
Is that your friend?

1017
00:55:15,246 --> 00:55:16,645
The girl I'm with?

1018
00:55:16,714 --> 00:55:19,239
We're sharing a car.

1019
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:22,946
You married?

1020
00:55:26,624 --> 00:55:29,787
I'm separated.

1021
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,226
You?

1022
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:36,289
What's that mean?

1023
00:55:37,802 --> 00:55:39,770
It means "mmm."

1024
00:55:45,543 --> 00:55:47,306
Okay.

1025
00:55:48,346 --> 00:55:50,814
Do you know how to dance?

1026
00:55:50,881 --> 00:55:53,406
As a matter of fact, I do.

1027
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:20,575
Cheaver's got some skills.

1028
00:56:20,644 --> 00:56:22,134
I think she likes him.

1029
00:56:29,687 --> 00:56:31,382
Do you wanna dance?

1030
00:56:31,455 --> 00:56:33,446
Can you dance?

1031
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:37,021
Of course I can dance.

1032
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:39,426
Nah, I meant your leg.

1033
00:56:40,598 --> 00:56:43,396
Oh, yeah.

1034
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:45,901
I don't know. We could try.

1035
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:47,938
Does it hurt?

1036
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:50,303
Yeah, a little, I guess.

1037
00:56:50,374 --> 00:56:54,037
I think if you put your foot on mine...

1038
00:56:54,111 --> 00:56:55,601
Put my foot on yours?

1039
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:57,271
Yeah.

1040
00:56:57,348 --> 00:56:59,111
- Like, on your toes?
- Sure.

1041
00:56:59,183 --> 00:57:01,151
- How's that?
- Yeah.

1042
00:57:01,218 --> 00:57:03,709
- We can try that.
- All right.

1043
00:57:05,956 --> 00:57:07,753
- Yeah, that helps it.
- Does it?

1044
00:57:07,825 --> 00:57:09,315
Okay.

1045
00:57:12,925 --> 00:57:15,655
Wow.

1046
00:57:15,728 --> 00:57:16,820
What?

1047
00:57:19,832 --> 00:57:23,996
You actually know how to be nice.

1048
00:57:50,963 --> 00:57:53,363
Where'd Cheaver go?

1049
00:57:53,432 --> 00:57:54,421
I don't know.

1050
00:57:57,970 --> 00:57:59,494
Cheaver?

1051
00:58:06,011 --> 00:58:07,569
Where the hell is he?

1052
00:58:09,281 --> 00:58:11,340
Maybe he went home with that woman.

1053
00:58:11,417 --> 00:58:13,112
He better not have.

1054
00:58:13,185 --> 00:58:15,779
Oh, come on.
Give the guy a break.

1055
00:58:15,854 --> 00:58:16,912
Cheaver!

1056
00:58:28,467 --> 00:58:29,695
Nah, I don't want to stay here.

1057
00:58:29,768 --> 00:58:33,363
Hey! These people are nice.

1058
00:58:33,439 --> 00:58:34,963
And we gotta sleep sometime.

1059
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,099
Yeah, you could have slept
while I was driving.

1060
00:58:37,176 --> 00:58:38,643
Look, we'll find Cheaver in the morning

1061
00:58:38,711 --> 00:58:41,009
and then we'll get going, okay?

1062
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,207
I think these are the guest rooms.

1063
00:58:43,282 --> 00:58:44,579
I'm gonna take this one.

1064
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:46,242
- Okay.
- Okay.

1065
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:47,615
All right.

1066
00:58:51,156 --> 00:58:53,590
- Good night.
- Good night.

1067
00:59:50,149 --> 00:59:51,411
Oh, my...

1068
00:59:51,483 --> 00:59:54,475
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, fuck.

1069
01:00:03,262 --> 01:00:05,025
I think I found Cheaver.

1070
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,893
Oh, yeah.

1071
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:25,508
I think I'm fixing to come!

1072
01:00:33,859 --> 01:00:35,190
Don't stop.

1073
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,557
Who's that?

1074
01:00:36,628 --> 01:00:37,993
It's just my husband.

1075
01:00:38,063 --> 01:00:39,360
- What?
- Don't stop.

1076
01:00:39,431 --> 01:00:40,921
Keep going.

1077
01:00:40,999 --> 01:00:42,466
Give it to her good, soldier.

1078
01:00:45,237 --> 01:00:46,568
There's someone else in there.

1079
01:00:59,384 --> 01:01:01,978
Cheaver, that woman wanted
to make a train with you.

1080
01:01:03,388 --> 01:01:04,878
Do you still want to kill yourself?

1081
01:01:04,957 --> 01:01:06,754
Not at the moment.

1082
01:01:06,825 --> 01:01:07,883
There's still hope, you know.

1083
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,450
That woman wanted you.

1084
01:01:09,528 --> 01:01:10,961
Yeah, and that man wanted you, too.

1085
01:01:11,029 --> 01:01:12,291
It's not funny.

1086
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,759
"I think I'm fixin' to come!"

1087
01:01:38,624 --> 01:01:42,219
I told this guy in the band
about Randy's guitar,

1088
01:01:42,294 --> 01:01:44,819
and he thinks it might
be worth thousands of dollars

1089
01:01:44,897 --> 01:01:47,229
or maybe even more.

1090
01:01:47,299 --> 01:01:49,824
- Great.
- Whatever.

1091
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,488
It'd be nice to go hiking
when we get to the Rockies,

1092
01:02:10,556 --> 01:02:12,148
don't you think?

1093
01:02:12,224 --> 01:02:13,248
Have a picnic.

1094
01:02:13,325 --> 01:02:15,657
No.

1095
01:02:53,966 --> 01:02:57,595
Denver, Colorado.

1096
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:13,108
Where are we?

1097
01:03:13,185 --> 01:03:15,016
What are you doing?

1098
01:03:15,087 --> 01:03:16,577
You'll see.

1099
01:03:36,808 --> 01:03:38,935
It's a good one.

1100
01:03:39,011 --> 01:03:42,003
I know a guy who'd come over here right now
and give you ten grand for it.

1101
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,240
10 grand?

1102
01:03:43,315 --> 01:03:44,577
10 grand.

1103
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:46,379
But...

1104
01:03:46,451 --> 01:03:51,286
it looks like someone
just got 22 at auction.

1105
01:03:53,225 --> 01:03:55,955
$22,000?

1106
01:03:56,028 --> 01:03:58,428
It's a very special instrument
you've got there.

1107
01:03:58,497 --> 01:04:00,192
Yes, sir.

1108
01:04:03,902 --> 01:04:05,563
Jeez.

1109
01:04:05,637 --> 01:04:09,073
$22,000!

1110
01:04:09,141 --> 01:04:11,974
You didn't believe me.

1111
01:04:12,044 --> 01:04:15,309
No, I thought it was just a stolen guitar.

1112
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:16,404
It's not stolen.

1113
01:04:16,481 --> 01:04:17,948
It belonged to his daddy.

1114
01:04:18,016 --> 01:04:19,574
But he stole something, right?

1115
01:04:19,651 --> 01:04:21,346
Yeah, he robbed a casino.

1116
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:22,978
Lucky Jim's.

1117
01:04:23,055 --> 01:04:24,249
That's right.

1118
01:04:24,323 --> 01:04:25,585
Walked in there by himself,

1119
01:04:25,657 --> 01:04:27,682
and he walked out with $50,000.

1120
01:04:27,759 --> 01:04:31,661
So Randy was, like, a bad ass, right?

1121
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:32,958
Yeah.

1122
01:04:33,031 --> 01:04:34,862
He was a good person, too, you know.

1123
01:04:34,933 --> 01:04:36,366
Came from a great family.

1124
01:04:36,435 --> 01:04:40,132
- He just robbed a little bit, is that it?
- Hello?

1125
01:04:40,205 --> 01:04:42,765
- Hey, Scott.
- Why'd he start robbing?

1126
01:04:42,841 --> 01:04:44,900
He just got, you know,
into a little bit of trouble.

1127
01:04:44,977 --> 01:04:48,504
Well, your mom and me have...

1128
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:52,414
some things we have to sort out.

1129
01:04:55,754 --> 01:04:57,654
No, no, it has nothing to do with that.

1130
01:04:57,723 --> 01:04:59,384
You're going to Stanford.

1131
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:02,359
We're gonna get you to Stanford.

1132
01:05:02,427 --> 01:05:04,759
No.

1133
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:07,890
No, no, no.
That is not a good idea.

1134
01:05:07,966 --> 01:05:10,434
No. Do not do that.

1135
01:05:10,502 --> 01:05:12,299
I will get you the money.

1136
01:05:12,371 --> 01:05:15,033
I will take care of it.
I said I will and I will.

1137
01:05:15,107 --> 01:05:19,066
Promise me you will not do that.

1138
01:05:21,313 --> 01:05:23,679
All right.

1139
01:05:23,749 --> 01:05:27,583
I'll call you later.

1140
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,280
All right. And...

1141
01:05:31,356 --> 01:05:32,288
I love you.

1142
01:05:32,357 --> 01:05:33,722
Fuck.

1143
01:05:35,994 --> 01:05:37,621
So what's up?

1144
01:05:38,797 --> 01:05:42,494
Kid thinks he's got it all figured out.

1145
01:05:42,567 --> 01:05:45,661
He's gonna get the money by enlisting
in the fucking Army.

1146
01:05:45,737 --> 01:05:47,637
$20,000 signing bonus,

1147
01:05:47,706 --> 01:05:49,765
has to put off college
for God knows how many years,

1148
01:05:49,841 --> 01:05:51,331
but he's okay with that.

1149
01:05:52,511 --> 01:05:54,741
Well, that sounds like a pretty good idea.

1150
01:05:54,813 --> 01:05:56,337
That is not a good idea.

1151
01:05:56,415 --> 01:05:57,848
They'll send him right over there.

1152
01:05:57,916 --> 01:05:59,144
I'm not gonna let that happen.

1153
01:06:02,287 --> 01:06:03,720
Maybe he could go to a state school.

1154
01:06:03,789 --> 01:06:05,916
No. You got a shot at Stanford,

1155
01:06:05,991 --> 01:06:07,049
you go to Stanford.

1156
01:06:07,125 --> 01:06:08,490
Exactly.

1157
01:06:10,462 --> 01:06:15,729
The problem is you can't
go there for free, you know.

1158
01:06:15,801 --> 01:06:18,463
I gotta get the money.
Get the money.

1159
01:06:18,537 --> 01:06:22,234
I'm gonna just...
I'll get the money.

1160
01:06:25,911 --> 01:06:28,141
I'm worried about you, Cheaver.

1161
01:06:31,049 --> 01:06:32,380
I'll figure something out.

1162
01:06:32,451 --> 01:06:35,750
If you're so worried about him,
why don't you give him that guitar of yours?

1163
01:06:35,821 --> 01:06:39,018
What? I can't give him Randy's guitar.

1164
01:06:39,091 --> 01:06:41,184
Why not? It's a stolen guitar.

1165
01:06:41,259 --> 01:06:42,726
It's not stolen.

1166
01:06:42,794 --> 01:06:46,093
It belongs to his family.

1167
01:06:46,164 --> 01:06:48,689
Besides, I mean, I don't see
the problem, you know.

1168
01:06:48,767 --> 01:06:51,327
I enlisted and I went over there.

1169
01:06:51,403 --> 01:06:52,893
Yeah, but what choice did you have?

1170
01:06:52,971 --> 01:06:56,771
And if I was gonna sell the guitar,
don't you think I'd use it

1171
01:06:56,842 --> 01:06:58,434
to pay for my own goddamn college?

1172
01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:00,137
Yeah, but it wouldn't be Stanford.

1173
01:07:00,212 --> 01:07:02,737
You don't know that.

1174
01:07:02,814 --> 01:07:05,510
Come on, the guy's gonna kill himself
if you don't give him that guitar.

1175
01:07:05,584 --> 01:07:08,417
I'm not gonna kill myself,
and I don't need your guitar.

1176
01:07:08,487 --> 01:07:10,148
All right, what are you gonna do then?

1177
01:07:10,222 --> 01:07:11,814
I'm gonna skip Salt Lake,

1178
01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:13,983
I'm gonna go to Vegas with you guys,

1179
01:07:14,059 --> 01:07:16,687
I'm gonna borrow some money
off my credit card,

1180
01:07:16,761 --> 01:07:19,059
and I'm gonna turn it into $20,000.

1181
01:07:19,131 --> 01:07:20,723
Oh, you gonna play poker?

1182
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:22,664
No, I was thinking roulette.

1183
01:07:22,734 --> 01:07:24,065
You play red and black,

1184
01:07:24,136 --> 01:07:26,696
guess the right color three times,
I got the money.

1185
01:07:26,771 --> 01:07:28,705
If I was you,
I'd stick to the skills games...

1186
01:07:28,773 --> 01:07:30,468
either blackjack or Texas hold 'em.

1187
01:07:30,542 --> 01:07:32,373
But whatever you do,
just stay away from craps.

1188
01:07:32,444 --> 01:07:35,004
That is the stupidest idea.

1189
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:36,377
Why?

1190
01:07:36,448 --> 01:07:38,848
It's crazy.

1191
01:07:38,917 --> 01:07:41,750
You can't just go to Vegas
and make $20,000.

1192
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:43,117
That's just... You're dreamin'.

1193
01:07:43,188 --> 01:07:45,053
Wait a minute. He's dreaming?

1194
01:07:45,123 --> 01:07:46,454
Yeah.

1195
01:07:46,525 --> 01:07:48,390
He's the one who's got the stupid idea?

1196
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:51,520
You're traveling
all the way across country

1197
01:07:51,596 --> 01:07:54,121
to visit a family that you've never even met.

1198
01:07:54,199 --> 01:07:56,463
Like, they don't know you're coming.

1199
01:07:56,535 --> 01:07:58,799
They don't even know you exist.

1200
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:00,804
You think they're gonna
love you or take care of you?

1201
01:08:00,872 --> 01:08:02,840
Like, he's not the one who's dreaming.

1202
01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:06,542
Christ.

1203
01:08:06,611 --> 01:08:08,636
Are you...

1204
01:08:08,713 --> 01:08:10,146
You gotta be kiddin...

1205
01:08:10,215 --> 01:08:12,206
I don't want him to lose his money.

1206
01:08:12,284 --> 01:08:15,879
Listen. Don't worry about me, okay?

1207
01:08:15,954 --> 01:08:17,387
Don't worry about me.

1208
01:08:17,455 --> 01:08:19,286
I have to give 'em the guitar.

1209
01:08:19,357 --> 01:08:22,258
I have to give it to them.

1210
01:08:22,327 --> 01:08:25,160
- But they don't even know you.
- I don't know you!

1211
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:28,996
Whoever heard of giving $20,000
to someone that you just met?

1212
01:08:29,067 --> 01:08:32,059
Yeah, but the guy's desperate.
He's all fucked up.

1213
01:08:32,137 --> 01:08:33,297
Enough.

1214
01:08:33,371 --> 01:08:34,838
I can pay for my own kid's college.

1215
01:08:34,906 --> 01:08:36,635
I'm just trying to help you, man.

1216
01:08:36,708 --> 01:08:38,175
You wanna talk about fucked up?

1217
01:08:38,243 --> 01:08:39,676
Look in the mirror.

1218
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:44,375
I'm not the one trying to kill myself, buddy.

1219
01:09:13,245 --> 01:09:16,009
Colee...

1220
01:09:16,081 --> 01:09:17,378
Colee stop crying.

1221
01:09:17,449 --> 01:09:20,441
I can't give you the guitar.

1222
01:09:20,518 --> 01:09:23,214
I can't give it to you.

1223
01:09:23,288 --> 01:09:25,722
I know. It's okay.

1224
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:28,987
It's not okay.

1225
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:32,188
I want to give it to you,
but then I won't have...

1226
01:09:33,431 --> 01:09:36,423
I won't have anywhere to go.

1227
01:09:46,711 --> 01:09:49,908
Colee. Come on, Colee.

1228
01:09:49,981 --> 01:09:51,778
All right, listen.

1229
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:54,978
How about you stop crying
and we'll stop.

1230
01:09:56,054 --> 01:09:57,214
What do you mean?

1231
01:09:57,289 --> 01:09:59,189
You been wanting to sightsee, right?

1232
01:10:00,225 --> 01:10:01,522
Yeah.

1233
01:10:01,593 --> 01:10:04,426
Okay, so we'll go somewhere,
do something.

1234
01:10:06,665 --> 01:10:08,565
Could we have a picnic?

1235
01:10:10,101 --> 01:10:11,295
Yeah, a picnic. Whatever.

1236
01:10:11,369 --> 01:10:12,393
Yeah.

1237
01:10:43,134 --> 01:10:45,364
You know, you can leave
your guitar in the car.

1238
01:10:45,437 --> 01:10:47,371
I'm not gonna steal it.

1239
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,108
Well, you might not think you are,

1240
01:10:51,176 --> 01:10:52,768
but I'm not chancing it.

1241
01:10:52,844 --> 01:10:55,074
I don't want to get ditched.

1242
01:10:55,146 --> 01:10:57,137
Why? Does that happen to you a lot?

1243
01:11:01,052 --> 01:11:03,282
Look at these rocks.

1244
01:11:03,355 --> 01:11:05,016
That's a skipping rock.

1245
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:06,421
That would go far, huh?

1246
01:11:06,491 --> 01:11:07,958
Yep.

1247
01:11:08,026 --> 01:11:09,960
Hey, that's a fossil.

1248
01:11:10,028 --> 01:11:11,086
That's a nice one.

1249
01:11:11,162 --> 01:11:13,392
- It is?
- A mollusk. See?

1250
01:11:16,835 --> 01:11:18,860
The poor little guy
winds up getting squished

1251
01:11:18,937 --> 01:11:20,996
between two rocks.

1252
01:11:27,946 --> 01:11:30,176
Why do we have to go back?

1253
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:35,485
I like it here. It's fun.

1254
01:12:10,488 --> 01:12:12,820
Oh, fuck.

1255
01:12:12,891 --> 01:12:15,758
- T.K.
- What?

1256
01:12:15,827 --> 01:12:17,089
Guess what.

1257
01:12:17,162 --> 01:12:18,561
What?

1258
01:12:20,865 --> 01:12:23,857
I got your problem solved.

1259
01:12:23,935 --> 01:12:26,369
What problem?

1260
01:12:26,438 --> 01:12:29,430
I was in the bathroom

1261
01:12:29,507 --> 01:12:32,032
and I met these real nice girls,

1262
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:34,601
and they travel around
in that RV over there.

1263
01:12:36,014 --> 01:12:38,778
And what they do
is they're sex workers.

1264
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:40,442
But they're real professional.

1265
01:12:40,518 --> 01:12:42,679
And I told them about
your problem and they said...

1266
01:12:42,754 --> 01:12:46,212
- You gotta stop telling people that!
- But they said they could take care of it.

1267
01:12:46,291 --> 01:12:47,656
And they said they'd give you a discount

1268
01:12:47,725 --> 01:12:49,488
'cause you're a serviceman
wounded in the war.

1269
01:12:49,561 --> 01:12:50,994
Sounds like a good deal to me.

1270
01:12:51,062 --> 01:12:53,257
That's what I thought.

1271
01:12:54,265 --> 01:12:56,062
What do you think?

1272
01:13:04,042 --> 01:13:05,407
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

1273
01:13:05,477 --> 01:13:08,207
- Hi.
- So here he is.

1274
01:13:08,279 --> 01:13:09,507
This is T.K.

1275
01:13:09,581 --> 01:13:13,073
T.K., this is Brandi,
Kendra and Savannah.

1276
01:13:13,151 --> 01:13:14,743
- Hey.
- Hey.

1277
01:13:14,819 --> 01:13:16,218
So how does this work?

1278
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:18,312
Does he just pick one of you or...

1279
01:13:18,389 --> 01:13:20,584
Yep, or he can have all three.

1280
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:23,118
How much?

1281
01:13:23,194 --> 01:13:25,924
He's so cute, I'll do it for free.

1282
01:13:25,997 --> 01:13:27,521
For free?

1283
01:13:27,599 --> 01:13:28,588
How does that sound?

1284
01:13:30,034 --> 01:13:31,899
Don't worry. She'll get it going.

1285
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:33,562
If she can't, nobody can.

1286
01:13:35,306 --> 01:13:37,501
You come with me.

1287
01:13:38,943 --> 01:13:40,035
Okay.

1288
01:13:42,213 --> 01:13:43,339
You're all right?

1289
01:13:47,185 --> 01:13:48,982
We're here for ya.

1290
01:13:56,361 --> 01:13:57,726
- Colee?
- Yeah?

1291
01:13:57,795 --> 01:13:59,160
Come on.

1292
01:14:02,267 --> 01:14:03,734
You all right?

1293
01:14:05,003 --> 01:14:06,937
Yeah.

1294
01:14:08,039 --> 01:14:10,803
- What?
- Colee.

1295
01:14:10,875 --> 01:14:13,343
No good deed goes unpunished.

1296
01:14:19,684 --> 01:14:21,345
- What's wrong?
- I got to...

1297
01:14:21,419 --> 01:14:22,386
You getting cold feet?

1298
01:14:22,453 --> 01:14:24,148
No, I gotta get something in my stomach...

1299
01:14:24,222 --> 01:14:25,587
What's the problem?

1300
01:14:25,657 --> 01:14:28,091
I haven't eaten anything except a hot dog
in the last 24 hours.

1301
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:29,820
So what? Eat later.

1302
01:14:29,894 --> 01:14:31,555
Well, I need to up my electrolytes.

1303
01:14:31,629 --> 01:14:33,028
You know, I need
a PowerBar or a Gatorade...

1304
01:14:33,097 --> 01:14:34,621
Okay. Do you have anything like that?

1305
01:14:34,699 --> 01:14:38,567
No. We just got Coke and tossed salad

1306
01:14:38,636 --> 01:14:40,331
and Marlboro Lights.

1307
01:14:40,405 --> 01:14:42,396
Hey, T.K., I saw a store on the way in.

1308
01:14:42,473 --> 01:14:44,373
All right, well...

1309
01:14:44,442 --> 01:14:47,775
I guess they're gonna go to the store.

1310
01:14:49,681 --> 01:14:52,548
Get me a fried egg sandwich on a roll!

1311
01:15:01,092 --> 01:15:02,787
Are you mad at me?

1312
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:05,226
No.

1313
01:15:05,296 --> 01:15:07,457
I'm sorry.

1314
01:15:07,532 --> 01:15:10,695
I was just trying to help.

1315
01:15:10,768 --> 01:15:12,793
I should just keep my big mouth shut.

1316
01:15:12,870 --> 01:15:14,667
Don't worry about it.

1317
01:15:20,812 --> 01:15:22,973
Wow, look at those clouds.

1318
01:15:40,832 --> 01:15:42,766
Wow, it's really coming down.

1319
01:15:49,774 --> 01:15:51,833
That's a good one.

1320
01:16:04,222 --> 01:16:05,917
This is unbelievable.

1321
01:16:26,611 --> 01:16:29,045
Wow.

1322
01:16:35,153 --> 01:16:36,814
Holy shit.

1323
01:16:36,888 --> 01:16:39,186
Holy shit is right.

1324
01:16:43,361 --> 01:16:44,794
Get out of the car.

1325
01:16:46,164 --> 01:16:47,392
I'm not getting out of the car.

1326
01:16:47,465 --> 01:16:48,989
You stay in this car you might die.

1327
01:16:49,067 --> 01:16:50,796
If I leave the car I might die.

1328
01:16:50,868 --> 01:16:54,360
T.K., open the door and get out.

1329
01:17:23,901 --> 01:17:26,802
It's okay.

1330
01:17:26,871 --> 01:17:29,499
You're gonna be fine.

1331
01:17:44,355 --> 01:17:48,655
Okay. Is it gone?

1332
01:17:48,726 --> 01:17:51,627
Oh, my God.

1333
01:17:51,696 --> 01:17:53,163
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1334
01:17:53,231 --> 01:17:54,892
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

1335
01:17:54,966 --> 01:17:57,491
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1336
01:17:59,537 --> 01:18:01,334
- Is it working?
- What?

1337
01:18:01,405 --> 01:18:02,963
Is it working?

1338
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,974
As a matter of fact, yeah, I think...

1339
01:18:05,042 --> 01:18:07,772
Yeah, it's working
pretty good right now, so...

1340
01:18:07,845 --> 01:18:10,075
That's great.

1341
01:18:10,148 --> 01:18:12,082
Oh, no. Okay.

1342
01:18:12,150 --> 01:18:13,117
Yeah, that's working.

1343
01:18:13,184 --> 01:18:16,551
That's great.

1344
01:18:16,621 --> 01:18:18,987
Yep.

1345
01:18:19,056 --> 01:18:22,321
Wow.

1346
01:18:22,393 --> 01:18:24,190
We should get out.

1347
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:40,877
Hey, chief!

1348
01:18:40,945 --> 01:18:42,037
Guess what.

1349
01:18:42,113 --> 01:18:43,045
What?

1350
01:18:43,114 --> 01:18:44,843
His penis works.

1351
01:18:44,916 --> 01:18:47,111
What do you mean?
You got wood?

1352
01:18:47,185 --> 01:18:49,949
Yeah. Definitely wood.

1353
01:18:50,021 --> 01:18:51,818
So we don't need
these ladies anymore?

1354
01:18:51,889 --> 01:18:54,619
Nope. He's all fixed up.

1355
01:18:54,692 --> 01:18:56,592
He could pound a nail with that thing.

1356
01:18:56,661 --> 01:18:58,492
Pound a nail?

1357
01:18:58,563 --> 01:19:00,087
How do you know that?
Did you touch it?

1358
01:19:00,164 --> 01:19:02,792
No, I didn't have to.
It was just pokin' right into me.

1359
01:19:02,867 --> 01:19:04,596
It's a miracle.

1360
01:19:04,669 --> 01:19:07,160
You are one lucky bastard, T.K.

1361
01:19:18,249 --> 01:19:19,273
You all right?

1362
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:21,716
Yeah, you don't seem too happy...

1363
01:19:21,786 --> 01:19:23,048
considering.

1364
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,088
I'm all right.

1365
01:19:25,156 --> 01:19:26,384
Yeah, I get to see my girlfriend,

1366
01:19:26,457 --> 01:19:28,721
go back down range
like nothing ever happened.

1367
01:19:28,793 --> 01:19:31,227
T.K., what are you worried about?

1368
01:19:31,295 --> 01:19:32,762
You're on a lucky streak.

1369
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:34,457
I don't think so.

1370
01:19:34,532 --> 01:19:36,659
I mean, you can only get lucky
for so long, you know?

1371
01:19:36,734 --> 01:19:38,964
Streaks don't last forever,
and I've been burnin' some karma.

1372
01:19:39,036 --> 01:19:41,504
Hey, you can't think that way.

1373
01:19:41,572 --> 01:19:43,563
It's gonna mess your head up,
get you in trouble over there.

1374
01:19:43,641 --> 01:19:47,133
Yeah, you gotta forget about luck.

1375
01:19:47,211 --> 01:19:49,270
I mean, look at Randy.

1376
01:19:49,347 --> 01:19:51,781
Robbing Lucky Jim's, not getting caught.

1377
01:19:51,849 --> 01:19:54,443
That was lucky. Amazing.

1378
01:19:54,518 --> 01:19:57,954
But maybe if he had have got caught,

1379
01:19:58,022 --> 01:20:00,752
he would have gone to jail
and he wouldn't have enlisted,

1380
01:20:00,825 --> 01:20:01,849
and then he might be alive.

1381
01:20:01,926 --> 01:20:03,951
That might be luckier.

1382
01:20:04,028 --> 01:20:06,690
So, you know, just don't think about luck.

1383
01:20:08,666 --> 01:20:11,328
I'm on my third tour.
The odds aren't good.

1384
01:20:14,205 --> 01:20:17,663
Maybe you need to change the odds.

1385
01:20:17,742 --> 01:20:19,232
Maybe you don't go back.

1386
01:20:20,778 --> 01:20:21,938
You can go to Canada.

1387
01:20:22,013 --> 01:20:23,207
Take a break.

1388
01:20:23,281 --> 01:20:26,580
No, I can't go to Canada, man.

1389
01:20:26,651 --> 01:20:28,278
You're a coward if you go to Canada.

1390
01:20:28,352 --> 01:20:30,946
Yeah, but you're a coward that's alive.

1391
01:20:31,022 --> 01:20:32,853
Plus you've done your service.

1392
01:20:32,924 --> 01:20:35,154
Given a lot.
More than most people.

1393
01:20:35,226 --> 01:20:36,352
I can't do it, you know.

1394
01:20:36,427 --> 01:20:37,985
They got shit football in Canada.

1395
01:20:38,062 --> 01:20:39,359
Become a hockey fan.

1396
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:41,421
No.

1397
01:20:41,499 --> 01:20:43,126
I don't know anyone up there, anyway.

1398
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,292
We'll come visit you.

1399
01:20:44,368 --> 01:20:46,233
I've never been to Canada.

1400
01:20:46,304 --> 01:20:47,965
- Yeah.
- Nah.

1401
01:20:48,039 --> 01:20:50,007
- Yeah.
- I'm good.

1402
01:21:35,019 --> 01:21:37,044
Hey! There's Lucky Jim's.

1403
01:21:39,991 --> 01:21:43,051
Robbing a casino's a ballsy thing to do.

1404
01:21:43,127 --> 01:21:44,754
In a weird way, you gotta admire it.

1405
01:21:44,829 --> 01:21:48,765
You know, he was wearing
a gorilla mask when he did it.

1406
01:21:48,833 --> 01:21:50,892
On Halloween
about three years ago.

1407
01:21:50,968 --> 01:21:54,199
Nobody even looked twice
at a guy running down the street

1408
01:21:54,271 --> 01:21:56,102
wearing a mask and carrying a gun.

1409
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:08,645
I'm happy for you, T.K.

1410
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:11,187
You know, you're going home
to your girlfriend,

1411
01:22:11,255 --> 01:22:12,916
and that's gonna be real nice.

1412
01:22:12,990 --> 01:22:15,458
You just treat her right.

1413
01:22:15,526 --> 01:22:16,458
Okay.

1414
01:22:16,527 --> 01:22:17,926
When you get married,

1415
01:22:17,995 --> 01:22:20,486
let me know 'cause I want
to send you something.

1416
01:22:20,564 --> 01:22:22,293
You got lots of celebrating to do.

1417
01:22:22,366 --> 01:22:25,164
You got your bridal shower
and your engagement party...

1418
01:22:25,236 --> 01:22:26,168
All right, Colee.

1419
01:22:26,237 --> 01:22:27,727
- Rehearsal dinner...
- Stop, stop, stop.

1420
01:22:27,805 --> 01:22:30,137
It's gonna be nice.

1421
01:22:30,207 --> 01:22:32,801
Just take care.

1422
01:22:36,747 --> 01:22:38,772
That was a bit forward.

1423
01:22:40,051 --> 01:22:41,450
Good luck at the tables.

1424
01:22:41,519 --> 01:22:42,611
Listen to me.

1425
01:22:42,686 --> 01:22:45,382
You go home,
do what you need to do there.

1426
01:22:45,456 --> 01:22:47,617
If I were you, I'd think twice
about going back.

1427
01:22:49,393 --> 01:22:51,520
Well, if I go home, I'm going back.

1428
01:22:51,595 --> 01:22:55,725
You know, my whole family's in the Army,
so it's almost the same thing.

1429
01:22:58,569 --> 01:23:01,129
Well, see you guys.

1430
01:23:10,414 --> 01:23:14,976
So, uh, you sure you don't want me
to drive you over to Randy's?

1431
01:23:15,052 --> 01:23:17,714
No, I gotta do this by myself.

1432
01:23:17,788 --> 01:23:19,016
Thanks.

1433
01:23:19,090 --> 01:23:21,024
I'll take a taxi.

1434
01:23:21,092 --> 01:23:23,083
Well, if you need anything,

1435
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:24,889
you give me a call.

1436
01:23:24,962 --> 01:23:26,520
All right?

1437
01:23:28,732 --> 01:23:32,065
I'm real sorry about that guitar.

1438
01:23:32,136 --> 01:23:33,694
Forget it.

1439
01:23:35,306 --> 01:23:37,137
You bring it to them.

1440
01:23:39,176 --> 01:23:40,939
They're gonna love you.

1441
01:23:51,489 --> 01:23:55,755
...worried about blowing up
some abandoned Iraqi tanks

1442
01:23:55,826 --> 01:23:57,418
and other personnel carriers...

1443
01:23:57,495 --> 01:23:58,427
What'll it be?

1444
01:23:58,496 --> 01:24:01,624
Can I get a shot of tequila?

1445
01:24:01,699 --> 01:24:05,897
Suddenly, out of an alleyway, wham!

1446
01:24:05,970 --> 01:24:09,497
There comes an RPG
and missiles from the air.

1447
01:24:09,573 --> 01:24:11,803
We have been trying
to get a live report...

1448
01:24:11,876 --> 01:24:13,741
Can you make that a double?

1449
01:24:40,037 --> 01:24:41,595
- Yes?
- Hi.

1450
01:24:41,672 --> 01:24:44,800
I'm Colee Dunn.

1451
01:24:44,875 --> 01:24:46,775
I was a friend of Randy's.

1452
01:24:46,844 --> 01:24:49,711
We served together and...

1453
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:51,805
this is his guitar.

1454
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:58,087
Well, come in.

1455
01:24:58,155 --> 01:25:00,419
And these flowers are for you, too.

1456
01:25:03,127 --> 01:25:04,992
Thank you.

1457
01:25:05,062 --> 01:25:07,462
We love flowers.

1458
01:25:10,267 --> 01:25:12,758
Here we are.

1459
01:25:12,836 --> 01:25:16,636
You know, you have
such a beautiful home.

1460
01:25:16,707 --> 01:25:18,072
Thanks.

1461
01:25:20,611 --> 01:25:21,578
I guess you didn't...

1462
01:25:21,645 --> 01:25:24,910
you didn't really need the flowers.

1463
01:25:24,982 --> 01:25:28,315
Well, we're always happy for more.

1464
01:25:28,385 --> 01:25:30,751
We have a flower
wholesaling business, so...

1465
01:25:30,821 --> 01:25:33,517
Randy probably told you that.

1466
01:25:33,591 --> 01:25:35,081
Of course, he never liked working there.

1467
01:25:35,159 --> 01:25:37,218
You know boys.

1468
01:25:37,294 --> 01:25:41,697
Always trying to prove they're men.

1469
01:25:41,765 --> 01:25:43,232
I guess working in a flower shop

1470
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:47,066
didn't quite go with that.

1471
01:25:47,137 --> 01:25:48,764
I must say, I didn't even know

1472
01:25:48,839 --> 01:25:51,307
that Randy played the guitar.

1473
01:25:52,943 --> 01:25:55,571
I thought that...

1474
01:25:55,646 --> 01:25:58,012
I thought that
maybe you gave it to him.

1475
01:26:02,119 --> 01:26:03,848
It wasn't in your family?

1476
01:26:03,921 --> 01:26:04,979
No.

1477
01:26:05,055 --> 01:26:08,422
Our family was never too musical.

1478
01:26:08,492 --> 01:26:11,984
So I don't know where he would have
gotten such a nice guitar.

1479
01:26:15,266 --> 01:26:17,427
That's funny.

1480
01:26:41,759 --> 01:26:43,249
How are you doing today, sir?

1481
01:26:44,928 --> 01:26:46,725
I'll know in about 30 minutes.

1482
01:26:49,066 --> 01:26:51,125
Never too old to sign up.

1483
01:26:51,201 --> 01:26:54,170
You ever think about it?

1484
01:26:54,238 --> 01:26:56,331
I just got out.

1485
01:26:56,407 --> 01:26:58,136
That'd be the best time to get back in.

1486
01:26:59,243 --> 01:27:00,904
Yeah.

1487
01:27:08,819 --> 01:27:10,377
There you go, sweetie.

1488
01:27:12,656 --> 01:27:14,146
<i>Your attention, please.

- You sure?
- Yes.

1495
01:27:38,048 --> 01:27:42,109
Just tell us some more
stories about Randy.

1496
01:27:43,287 --> 01:27:45,255
Okay...

1497
01:27:46,857 --> 01:27:49,826
All right, I'm gonna get that.
Tom, that toast is burning.

1498
01:27:58,035 --> 01:28:00,902
Shannon, this is Colee.

1499
01:28:00,971 --> 01:28:02,666
Colee served with Randy.

1500
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:03,934
Hi.

1501
01:28:04,007 --> 01:28:05,099
Hi.

1502
01:28:05,175 --> 01:28:08,542
And this is little Jessie.

1503
01:28:08,612 --> 01:28:11,274
He looks just like
his daddy, don't you think?

1504
01:28:11,348 --> 01:28:12,872
He's got Randy's eyes.

1505
01:28:12,950 --> 01:28:15,851
But he's got a bald spot just like you.

1506
01:28:16,954 --> 01:28:19,252
Give me that baby.

1507
01:28:19,323 --> 01:28:21,951
Stop it.

1508
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:25,620
That's my boy. Yeah.

1509
01:28:39,943 --> 01:28:41,570
How you doing?

1510
01:28:43,313 --> 01:28:44,575
I'm good.

1511
01:28:44,648 --> 01:28:47,378
I'm sorry, Colee.

1512
01:28:47,451 --> 01:28:49,715
You didn't know about Shannon, did ya?

1513
01:28:49,787 --> 01:28:52,950
Yeah, I knew.

1514
01:28:53,023 --> 01:28:54,285
I knew about that.

1515
01:28:54,358 --> 01:28:57,122
He's a damn fool, Randy.

1516
01:28:57,194 --> 01:28:58,855
He never slept with the girl but once.

1517
01:28:58,929 --> 01:29:00,453
He barely knew her.

1518
01:29:00,531 --> 01:29:02,931
But she got pregnant.

1519
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,333
Then he disappeared
and, of course, we felt responsible.

1520
01:29:06,403 --> 01:29:07,961
She was gonna have a baby.

1521
01:29:12,976 --> 01:29:15,706
It doesn't change
whatever you had with Randy.

1522
01:29:15,779 --> 01:29:17,906
Hope you know that.

1523
01:29:24,321 --> 01:29:28,621
<i>This is the final call for Air Canada</i>
<i>Flight 63 to Vancouver.

1524
01:30:28,085 --> 01:30:30,918
He's looking at me to see
if it's okay to eat them.

1525
01:30:30,988 --> 01:30:32,615
- Yes, you may eat them.
- You go right ahead.

1526
01:30:32,689 --> 01:30:33,986
That's delicious.

1527
01:30:37,761 --> 01:30:39,251
Hey, Colee.

1528
01:30:39,329 --> 01:30:42,765
I just want to say

1529
01:30:42,833 --> 01:30:46,735
that Jeanie and I
have talked about this,

1530
01:30:46,803 --> 01:30:50,034
and seeing that you're
kind of out of touch

1531
01:30:50,107 --> 01:30:52,575
with your own family,

1532
01:30:52,643 --> 01:30:56,943
well, we want you to know that...

1533
01:30:57,014 --> 01:30:58,276
that you're welcome to stay here

1534
01:30:58,348 --> 01:30:59,679
for the rest of your leave.

1535
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:01,274
Really?

1536
01:31:08,525 --> 01:31:10,254
Wow, that's...

1537
01:31:13,797 --> 01:31:15,355
That's so nice.

1538
01:31:17,467 --> 01:31:19,367
I have something that I want to say, too.

1539
01:31:26,376 --> 01:31:30,369
Shannon...

1540
01:31:30,447 --> 01:31:32,711
there's a couple things that you should know.

1541
01:31:36,753 --> 01:31:40,746
Randy... he loved you
with all his heart and soul,

1542
01:31:40,824 --> 01:31:43,850
and he talked about you all the time.

1543
01:31:46,630 --> 01:31:50,589
And, you know, he knew
that he had made a big mistake

1544
01:31:50,667 --> 01:31:53,602
and he was gonna make it up to you.

1545
01:31:56,039 --> 01:31:59,736
And, Tom and Jeanie,
he just loved you so much.

1546
01:31:59,810 --> 01:32:01,505
He knew what great parents you were

1547
01:32:01,578 --> 01:32:06,447
and grandparents, too, and...

1548
01:32:06,516 --> 01:32:10,043
and he was just so looking forward
to coming home.

1549
01:32:14,324 --> 01:32:16,485
Ya'll have been so nice to me.

1550
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:17,822
And I think I should go.

1551
01:32:17,894 --> 01:32:19,725
- No, no, no.
- Yeah, no...

1552
01:32:19,796 --> 01:32:20,728
You can stay, can't ya?

1553
01:32:20,797 --> 01:32:22,264
No, I think I should go.

1554
01:32:25,769 --> 01:32:29,671
And, you know, I was thinking...

1555
01:32:29,740 --> 01:32:31,901
would it be all right if I took that guitar?

1556
01:32:31,975 --> 01:32:33,840
Randy's guitar?

1557
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:36,310
Is that okay?

1558
01:32:38,415 --> 01:32:40,007
You take it.

1559
01:32:41,918 --> 01:32:44,512
You're welcome to it.

1560
01:32:46,757 --> 01:32:48,588
Thank you.

1561
01:33:24,361 --> 01:33:25,555
Excuse me.

1562
01:33:25,629 --> 01:33:28,928
I have a friend who I think got arrested.

1563
01:33:28,999 --> 01:33:29,966
You just brought him in.

1564
01:33:30,033 --> 01:33:31,557
- What's the name?
- Poole.

1565
01:33:31,635 --> 01:33:32,659
T.K. Poole.

1566
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:38,740
Yeah, we got him.

1567
01:33:38,809 --> 01:33:40,242
Can I see him?

1568
01:33:40,310 --> 01:33:42,175
He's still being processed.
You're gonna have to wait.

1569
01:33:44,648 --> 01:33:45,740
What'd he do?

1570
01:33:45,816 --> 01:33:47,647
Doesn't say.

1571
01:33:47,718 --> 01:33:50,448
Must have done something.

1572
01:33:54,858 --> 01:33:55,825
Hello?

1573
01:33:55,892 --> 01:33:57,291
Cheaver!

1574
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:59,260
Guess what. I got the guitar.

1575
01:33:59,329 --> 01:34:01,490
I told you not to worry about that.

1576
01:34:01,565 --> 01:34:04,033
Are you still in Vegas?
Can I come meet you?

1577
01:34:10,907 --> 01:34:12,841
- Hey.
- Hey.

1578
01:34:21,618 --> 01:34:23,108
How is he?

1579
01:34:23,186 --> 01:34:24,619
They won't let me see him.

1580
01:34:24,688 --> 01:34:27,589
Well, what did he do?

1581
01:34:27,657 --> 01:34:29,648
I don't know.

1582
01:34:34,865 --> 01:34:37,265
Sir? When can we see our friend?

1583
01:34:37,334 --> 01:34:38,824
You can't.

1584
01:34:38,902 --> 01:34:41,166
Listen, we gotta see him.

1585
01:34:41,238 --> 01:34:42,933
He's in the Army. We all are.

1586
01:34:43,006 --> 01:34:45,065
And he's home on leave for just 30 days.

1587
01:34:45,142 --> 01:34:46,837
Now you might not know what that's like...

1588
01:34:46,910 --> 01:34:49,538
I know just what that's like.

1589
01:34:49,613 --> 01:34:51,774
I was a Marine in Desert Storm.

1590
01:34:53,450 --> 01:34:55,680
Well, then maybe you can help us out.

1591
01:35:04,661 --> 01:35:07,391
I have my problems
with my approach shot.

1592
01:35:07,464 --> 01:35:09,022
Oh, see, yeah.

1593
01:35:09,099 --> 01:35:11,067
All you gotta do is just shorten up
that back swing,

1594
01:35:11,134 --> 01:35:14,103
and I guarantee
you'll hit the green every time.

1595
01:35:15,806 --> 01:35:17,239
That's it.

1596
01:35:17,307 --> 01:35:18,774
Like, I don't like to brag,

1597
01:35:18,842 --> 01:35:20,139
'cause bragging doesn't come easy to me,

1598
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:23,702
but, you know, last time I played
Number 4 at Kuwait City,

1599
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:25,270
I got a hole in one.

1600
01:35:25,348 --> 01:35:27,373
- Aw, come on, you're bullshitting me.
- No. I'm serious.

1601
01:35:27,450 --> 01:35:30,578
And it was amazing because
the ball never even hit the grass.

1602
01:35:30,654 --> 01:35:32,884
It just dropped straight in the hole.

1603
01:35:32,956 --> 01:35:34,287
There was nothing but cup.

1604
01:35:34,357 --> 01:35:36,552
Swear...

1605
01:35:36,626 --> 01:35:38,491
That's amazing.

1606
01:35:38,562 --> 01:35:39,586
Beautiful, beautiful.

1607
01:35:39,663 --> 01:35:40,687
You know these two?

1608
01:35:42,332 --> 01:35:44,095
Yeah. Hey, guys.

1609
01:35:44,167 --> 01:35:45,794
Hi.

1610
01:35:45,869 --> 01:35:47,734
Hey, your friend here is a real hero.

1611
01:35:47,804 --> 01:35:49,965
Yeah, we know, but why is he here?

1612
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:52,770
He's here because
he served his country honorably

1613
01:35:52,843 --> 01:35:56,108
and then he came back
and took responsibility for a past mistake.

1614
01:35:56,179 --> 01:35:57,476
That's as brave as it gets.

1615
01:35:57,547 --> 01:35:59,412
What's the charge?

1616
01:35:59,482 --> 01:36:00,574
Armed robbery.

1617
01:36:00,650 --> 01:36:01,810
Armed robbery?

1618
01:36:01,885 --> 01:36:03,648
What did he rob?

1619
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:06,689
You ever heard of a casino
called Lucky Jim's?

1620
01:36:11,261 --> 01:36:13,126
Yeah.

1621
01:36:13,196 --> 01:36:14,629
Yeah, I heard of that.

1622
01:36:14,698 --> 01:36:18,293
So you robbed Lucky Jim's?

1623
01:36:18,368 --> 01:36:20,962
Yeah.

1624
01:36:21,037 --> 01:36:24,632
And couldn't keep it a secret anymore.

1625
01:36:24,708 --> 01:36:27,336
The guilt was just keeping me up at night.

1626
01:36:27,410 --> 01:36:29,935
A guy who can man up
to his past got my respect.

1627
01:36:34,417 --> 01:36:36,476
Could we have a moment alone with him?

1628
01:36:36,553 --> 01:36:38,418
Is that all right with you?

1629
01:36:38,488 --> 01:36:39,978
Yeah.

1630
01:36:45,462 --> 01:36:47,657
Lucky Jim's?

1631
01:36:47,731 --> 01:36:49,130
Why are you doing this?

1632
01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:52,032
Well, like you said,
I gotta do what I gotta do.

1633
01:36:52,102 --> 01:36:54,002
Find a way to stay alive.

1634
01:36:54,070 --> 01:36:56,368
What, to keep from going back?

1635
01:36:56,439 --> 01:36:57,838
Yeah, it's perfect.

1636
01:36:57,908 --> 01:37:00,376
No. You're gonna go to prison.

1637
01:37:00,443 --> 01:37:02,775
Look at me.
Prison's gonna be easy on a guy like me.

1638
01:37:02,846 --> 01:37:04,871
I got it all figured out.

1639
01:37:04,948 --> 01:37:06,347
I can get a college degree in there.

1640
01:37:06,416 --> 01:37:09,317
These guys said I'll be out in 18 months.

1641
01:37:09,386 --> 01:37:11,479
This is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1642
01:37:11,554 --> 01:37:12,680
You'll be an ex-con.

1643
01:37:12,756 --> 01:37:14,849
- Yeah, but a living ex-con.
- Right.

1644
01:37:14,925 --> 01:37:17,917
T.K., this is crazy.

1645
01:37:17,994 --> 01:37:19,586
Everybody okay in here?

1646
01:37:19,663 --> 01:37:21,358
- Yep.
- Yes.

1647
01:37:21,431 --> 01:37:23,922
You didn't get hit too hard in the head
fighting over there, did ya?

1648
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,126
No, sir. No.

1649
01:37:25,201 --> 01:37:29,262
Well, then you're all very funny.

1650
01:37:29,339 --> 01:37:32,365
So funny you can get your asses
the hell out of here.

1651
01:37:32,442 --> 01:37:36,378
You think I got time to waste,
Mr. Big Shot Hero?

1652
01:37:36,446 --> 01:37:38,346
You rob Lucky Jim's?

1653
01:37:38,415 --> 01:37:39,507
Yes, sir.

1654
01:37:39,582 --> 01:37:41,379
That's interesting.

1655
01:37:41,451 --> 01:37:44,079
'Cause Lucky Jim's
has never been robbed.

1656
01:37:47,290 --> 01:37:49,383
Sure it has.

1657
01:37:49,459 --> 01:37:51,723
I checked all the records.

1658
01:37:51,795 --> 01:37:55,526
And I just got off the phone
with Lucky Jim himself.

1659
01:37:58,134 --> 01:37:59,761
Now come on, get out of here.

1660
01:37:59,836 --> 01:38:01,463
Take a walk.

1661
01:38:12,349 --> 01:38:13,543
T.K., you okay?

1662
01:38:14,551 --> 01:38:16,576
Hey.

1663
01:38:16,653 --> 01:38:18,348
Oh, man.

1664
01:38:18,421 --> 01:38:20,946
I can't believe I almost did that.

1665
01:38:23,626 --> 01:38:24,752
I can't believe I did that.

1666
01:38:24,828 --> 01:38:27,797
Don't worry. We get it.

1667
01:38:31,368 --> 01:38:33,336
I'm sorry, guys.

1668
01:38:33,403 --> 01:38:35,132
- Don't worry about it.
- Nah, I'm real sorry.

1669
01:38:35,205 --> 01:38:37,139
It's okay.

1670
01:38:37,207 --> 01:38:39,937
Now I'm fucked up.

1671
01:38:44,214 --> 01:38:46,512
Wow, it's official.
I'm fucked up.

1672
01:38:48,518 --> 01:38:50,145
Did you guys know how fucked up I was?

1673
01:38:52,522 --> 01:38:55,423
Didn't really show... that much.

1674
01:38:55,492 --> 01:38:59,155
I gotta reevaluate.

1675
01:38:59,229 --> 01:39:00,628
You know what?

1676
01:39:00,697 --> 01:39:02,631
I'm starting to see things
more clearly right now.

1677
01:39:02,699 --> 01:39:04,428
Good.

1678
01:39:04,501 --> 01:39:06,560
Great.

1679
01:39:06,636 --> 01:39:08,126
I realize that...

1680
01:39:12,375 --> 01:39:15,071
I don't know shit, man.

1681
01:39:15,145 --> 01:39:17,136
Fuck.

1682
01:39:18,982 --> 01:39:20,506
I don't know shit.

1683
01:39:21,885 --> 01:39:24,353
You know some things.

1684
01:39:24,421 --> 01:39:25,353
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1685
01:39:26,423 --> 01:39:28,152
You got the basic skills.

1686
01:39:36,566 --> 01:39:39,262
So how were Randy's parents?

1687
01:39:39,335 --> 01:39:41,030
They were real nice.

1688
01:39:41,104 --> 01:39:42,469
Good, I'm glad.

1689
01:39:42,539 --> 01:39:45,007
And so was Randy's girlfriend
and his baby, too.

1690
01:39:45,075 --> 01:39:46,303
- Oh. God.
- Ouch.

1691
01:39:46,376 --> 01:39:47,468
Yep.

1692
01:39:49,079 --> 01:39:51,775
But look, I got the guitar,

1693
01:39:51,848 --> 01:39:53,679
and, Cheaver, I want you to have it.

1694
01:39:53,750 --> 01:39:56,480
That's real sweet of you,

1695
01:39:56,553 --> 01:39:59,317
but I don't need it.

1696
01:40:00,690 --> 01:40:01,679
I got the money.

1697
01:40:01,758 --> 01:40:03,658
- What?
- How much did you win?

1698
01:40:03,726 --> 01:40:08,163
I didn't win anything.
I didn't even place a bet.

1699
01:40:08,231 --> 01:40:09,357
I reenlisted.

1700
01:40:09,432 --> 01:40:11,957
You what?

1701
01:40:12,035 --> 01:40:13,900
You what?

1702
01:40:15,438 --> 01:40:17,269
I reenlisted.

1703
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:19,240
Got a $20,000 signing bonus.

1704
01:40:19,309 --> 01:40:21,573
I'm all set.

1705
01:40:21,644 --> 01:40:23,202
That's insane.

1706
01:40:23,279 --> 01:40:24,712
You're calling me insane?

1707
01:40:24,781 --> 01:40:26,476
Cheaver, I got you the guitar.

1708
01:40:26,549 --> 01:40:28,540
Sell it. Get the money that way.

1709
01:40:28,618 --> 01:40:31,553
You need that guitar
more than I do, Colee.

1710
01:40:31,621 --> 01:40:34,146
No. I got Army money saved up.

1711
01:40:34,224 --> 01:40:36,351
I'm gonna be fine.

1712
01:40:36,426 --> 01:40:38,724
And I'm gonna find my mom
and patch things up,

1713
01:40:38,795 --> 01:40:40,160
so you take it.

1714
01:40:40,230 --> 01:40:42,562
No. I'm going back.

1715
01:40:42,632 --> 01:40:44,099
Recruiter called my home unit.

1716
01:40:44,167 --> 01:40:45,930
They're transferring the paperwork now.

1717
01:40:46,002 --> 01:40:48,493
You can get out of that.

1718
01:40:48,571 --> 01:40:50,903
I don't know that I want to.

1719
01:40:50,974 --> 01:40:53,568
Cheaver, take the guitar.

1720
01:40:53,643 --> 01:40:55,167
Please.

1721
01:40:57,780 --> 01:40:59,873
You take that guitar, Colee.

1722
01:41:01,217 --> 01:41:03,014
It's your guitar.

1723
01:41:03,086 --> 01:41:04,519
Yeah?

1724
01:41:04,587 --> 01:41:06,987
Yeah.

1725
01:41:09,125 --> 01:41:10,183
Thank you.

1726
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:13,991
No. Thank you.

1727
01:41:59,943 --> 01:42:01,535
Sergeant.

1728
01:42:02,845 --> 01:42:05,245
T.K.

1729
01:42:05,315 --> 01:42:06,282
How are ya?

1730
01:42:06,349 --> 01:42:08,715
Good. Good.

1731
01:42:08,785 --> 01:42:10,480
So you got here.

1732
01:42:12,655 --> 01:42:14,748
Excuse me.

1733
01:42:18,428 --> 01:42:20,123
- Look who it is.
- Hey.

1734
01:42:20,196 --> 01:42:22,528
- How are ya?
- Good. How are you doing?

1735
01:42:22,599 --> 01:42:24,567
- How are you doing?
- How are you doing?

1736
01:42:26,903 --> 01:42:27,870
Where's your guitar?

1737
01:42:27,937 --> 01:42:29,336
Did you sell it?

1738
01:42:29,405 --> 01:42:31,100
Sell it?

1739
01:42:31,174 --> 01:42:33,108
Hell, no. I'm learning how to play it.

1740
01:42:33,176 --> 01:42:34,905
- You're learning to play it?
- Yep.

1741
01:42:34,978 --> 01:42:36,468
All right.

1742
01:42:39,148 --> 01:42:41,708
How's your fiancée?

1743
01:42:41,784 --> 01:42:44,218
She's fine.

1744
01:42:44,287 --> 01:42:46,778
But she's not my fiancée anymore.

1745
01:42:51,861 --> 01:42:53,158
Where are you going?

1746
01:42:53,229 --> 01:42:54,457
I'm going to Diyala.

1747
01:42:54,530 --> 01:42:56,964
- Where are you going?
- Anbar.

1748
01:42:58,935 --> 01:43:00,368
Where are you going?

1749
01:43:00,436 --> 01:43:01,926
Tikrit.
