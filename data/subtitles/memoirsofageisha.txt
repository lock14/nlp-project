1
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,382
Tanaka-san!

2
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,229
Tanaka-san!

3
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,300
<i>A story like mine</i>
<i>should never be told.</i>

4
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,339
<i>For my world is as forbidden</i>
<i>as it is fragile.</i>

5
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,867
<i>Without its mysteries,</i>
<i>it cannot survive.</i>

6
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,863
<i>I certainly wasn't born</i>
<i>to the life of a geisha.</i>

7
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,504
<i>Like so much in my strange life...</i>

8
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,668
<i>... I was carried there by the current.</i>

9
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,787
<i>The first time I knew</i>
<i>my mother was sick...</i>

10
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:12,619
<i>... was when my father threw the fish</i>
<i>back into the sea.</i>

11
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,988
<i>That night we went hungry.</i>

12
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,739
<i>"To understand emptiness,"</i>
<i>he told us.</i>

13
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,902
<i>Mother always said my sister Satsu</i>
<i>was like wood.</i>

14
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,420
<i>As rooted to the earth</i>
<i>as a sakura tree.</i>

15
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,703
<i>But she told me I was like water.</i>

16
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,304
<i>Water can carve its way,</i>
<i>even through stone.</i>

17
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,466
<i>And when trapped,</i>
<i>water makes a new path.</i>

18
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,303
Stop here.

19
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,221
These are the girls from Tanaka?

20
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,183
Sisters, yes, from Yoroido.

21
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,549
This one, maybe.
The other one, no.

22
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,586
- No, no, Chiyo! Chiyo! Chiyo!
- Satsu! Satsu!

23
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,940
- Chiyo!
- Satsu!

24
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,025
Show your respect for Mother.

25
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,461
You must not speak.
I will answer for you.

26
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,423
Kneel.

27
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,067
And head down.
Never look her in the face.

28
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,469
- How old are you?
- She is Year of the Rooster.

29
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,178
Only 9.

30
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,862
Where is my sister?

31
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,785
Let me see those eyes.

32
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,149
Look at me.

33
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,667
Too much water.

34
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,863
But, <i>Okasan</i>, a little water
is good to guard against fire.

35
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,459
You won't have to worry
about the <i>okiya</i> burning...

36
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,706
...losing all your kimono.

37
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,140
These country girls.

38
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,740
Too late to send her back now.

39
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,429
Go.

40
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,426
Pumpkin. Keep her quiet.
Mother is downstairs.

41
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,787
Let me go!

42
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,984
Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!

43
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,306
- Stop that.
- Let me go!

44
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,104
Mother will hear you.
She's got a bamboo stick.

45
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,507
I want my sister! Satsu!

46
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,825
I cried too at first.

47
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,859
You know, it is easier
if you just forget everything...

48
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,743
...that happened before
you came to the <i>okiya.</i>

49
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:47,223
If you impress Mother
and do exactly as she says...

50
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,388
...she will send you to school
to be a geisha.

51
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,459
A what?

52
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,343
A geisha. Like Hatsumomo.

53
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,460
You will get to drink <i>sake</i>
and sleep until noon.

54
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,861
Where is my sister?

55
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,628
Probably in another <i>okiya</i>
in the <i>hanamachi.</i>

56
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,469
Your family sold you to this house.

57
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,821
You live here now.

58
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,146
Outside, you wear these.

59
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,701
Inside, these.

60
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,826
We don't display our naked feet
like monkeys.

61
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,543
It's not flesh we're selling here.

62
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,581
This is a geisha house.

63
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,784
Remember to always honour
this <i>okiya.</i>

64
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,299
You listen, you learn.

65
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,944
Now get to work.

66
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,542
Be quiet. Hatsumomo is sleeping.

67
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,102
Pumpkin, when can I go outside?

68
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:14,667
Outside the <i>okiya</i>?
You can't. It's not allowed.

69
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,588
How will I find Satsu?

70
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,940
You can't just walk up to every house
in the <i>hanamachi.</i>

71
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,666
Do you know how many there are?

72
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,909
Look.

73
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,623
Tighter!

74
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,865
Chiyo. Chiyo-chan.

75
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:30,942
Come. Two nights ago, Hatsumomo
had to stay at the teahouse until dawn.

76
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,184
That's what she told Mother. But she
was really here with a man the whole...

77
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,460
Why can't you be quiet?

78
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:46,423
So this is the new arrival.

79
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,063
A pity she still stinks of fish.

80
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,785
Stay out of my room.

81
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,661
Your fingers smell.

82
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,908
I can't have you touching my things.

83
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,508
Only reason Mother tolerates
Hatsumomo...

84
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,429
...is because she brings in
good money.

85
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,541
Never forget.

86
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,060
It is Hatsumomo
who pays for your supper...

87
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,739
...the clothes on your back.

88
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,781
By the time she was 20...

89
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:01,469
...she had already earned back
her purchase price.

90
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,308
Unheard of.

91
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,505
She has been the talk
of the <i>hanamachi e</i>ver since.

92
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,227
These are all hers?

93
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,219
Certainly not.
They belong to the <i>okiya.</i>

94
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,622
A kimono like this,
made of Tatsumura silk...

95
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:23,223
...it would take a lifetime to earn.

96
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,906
A geisha needs
an elegant wardrobe...

97
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,022
...just like an artist needs ink.

98
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:38,065
If she's not properly dressed,
then she is not a true geisha.

99
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,306
Nobody told me what a geisha is.

100
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,865
You will find out soon enough.

101
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,265
I have news for you, child.

102
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,544
Mother has determined
it is off to school with you.

103
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,310
You are to become geisha.

104
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,623
Chiyo! Pumpkin!

105
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,388
Quick, quick! Don't be late!

106
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,062
You will be late.

107
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,506
Go. Go.

108
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,943
This way!

109
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,461
Pumpkin! Pumpkin!

110
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:40,823
Pumpkin! I'm going to run.
I'm going to find Satsu.

111
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,827
No, Chiyo-chan, don't!

112
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,430
You will ruin your own chances.
And mine too.

113
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,098
Please, stay with me.

114
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,060
Squid. Come on!

115
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:20,184
Look for your sister's name later.

116
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,907
You are late!

117
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:05,505
Chiyo! Where is Granny's food?

118
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,181
Where have you been?

119
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,429
It's freezing cold!

120
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,828
Close the window!

121
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:21,343
<i>- With millions of people unemployed,</i>
<i>on the brink of starvation.</i>

122
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,781
<i>Banking institutions have continued</i>
<i>to suffer in Germany...</i>

123
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,628
<i>... due to rapid inflation.</i>

124
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,902
<i>Another cause of Germany's suffering</i>
<i>is the constant struggle...</i>

125
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,829
<i>... to pay the heavy burden</i>
<i>of war reparations it's still...</i>

126
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,942
Chiyo! Chiyo, come quickly!

127
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:40,499
Hatsumomo is at the bathhouse.
Tidy up.

128
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:45,306
- But she told me to stay out...
- Hatsumomo does not run this <i>okiya.</i>

129
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,504
<i>The Japanese emperor has agreed to</i>
<i>send army instructors to Manchuria.</i>

130
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,903
Why, look who's in my room.

131
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,260
Did you touch this?

132
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,183
I can just hear the General now.

133
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:36,349
"Why, Hatsumomo,
you used to smell of jasmine.

134
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:40,828
What's this new perfume?
Blowfish?"

135
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:46,425
I told you never to touch my things.
Can't you understand why?

136
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:53,300
Because your General will say,
" Hatsumomo, you stink<i>."</i>

137
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:01,139
At least you don't smell as bad
as your sister.

138
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:05,867
You know, she was here.
She came by looking for you.

139
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,389
What?

140
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,144
Was I wrong to ask her to leave?

141
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,944
Please, tell me where she is.

142
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,823
Only if you swear yourself
to me first.

143
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,542
Yes?

144
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,390
Now, get out.

145
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:54,578
Hatsumomo.
You'll wake the entire house.

146
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:59,068
Your big sister is thirsty. So am I.
Go get us some beer.

147
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,025
I'm not in the mood for beer.

148
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:07,384
I know what you're in the mood for,
and his name is Koichi.

149
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,626
What did you say, Korin?

150
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,224
I'm sorry. I forgot.

151
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,621
You're just jealous
someone cares for me.

152
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,786
Guess who this belongs to.

153
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,663
A geisha as desired as she is...

154
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,021
...ought to keep a close eye
on her clothes.

155
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,341
- It's Mameha's?
- Yes.

156
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,428
- How did you get it?
- Bribed her maid.

157
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,461
- There.
- I can't.

158
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,819
Give it to her.

159
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,061
- Little Chiyo, come. Come.
- Chiyo.

160
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:09,470
Now, then, little Chiyo,
it's time to practice your calligraphy.

161
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,309
There.

162
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:27,583
Remember, you swore yourself
to me.

163
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,508
Yes.

164
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,546
Don't let anybody see you.

165
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,468
Go, go!

166
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,900
This will teach the great Mameha.

167
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,584
Come, come.

168
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,058
Thieving rat!

169
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,060
That kimono was worth more
than you!

170
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,546
Careful! You will hurt yourself
more than her!

171
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,024
Let me.

172
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,383
Kneel!

173
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:08,024
What have you done
to Hatsumomo?

174
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,701
I haven't done anything.
I promise you.

175
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:14,425
Her little trick with that kimono
will cost you.

176
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:20,068
Whatever you have done to anger her,
you'd be wise to stop now.

177
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,063
Lie facedown!

178
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,102
I will beat you hard...

179
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,744
...so Mother does not
beat you harder.

180
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:00,027
I told you not to let anybody see you.

181
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,060
I have kept my promise.

182
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:07,068
So tell me, where is she?

183
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:14,819
She's in the next <i>hanamachi</i>
in the house called Tatsuyo.

184
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,786
In the pleasure district.

185
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,739
Trust me, little Chiyo,
you will find her.

186
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,948
Tatsuyo?

187
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,381
Satsu! Satsu!

188
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,943
Satsu!

189
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,744
Satsu from Yoroido! Satsu! Satsu!

190
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:24,823
No! Satsu! No! Satsu! Satsu!

191
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,018
Sat...

192
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,266
Satsu! Satsu!

193
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,509
Chiyo-chan!

194
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:03,220
- What took you so long?
- But, Satsu, I tried!

195
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,900
I went to your <i>okiya</i> weeks ago.
They laughed and turned me away.

196
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,499
Please, I did not know!

197
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,621
I've missed you so much!

198
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,749
Let's leave. Tonight.

199
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,863
But we need money, Chiyo. I know
I can steal some first thing tomorrow.

200
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,982
- No, please! Tonight!
- No, tomorrow!

201
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:29,229
Meet me at the Sasame Bridge
as soon as it's dark.

202
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:34,898
Now I have to go. Quickly,
before someone catches us.

203
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,828
What if I cannot get away?

204
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,380
Be there, Chiyo.
It's our one chance.

205
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,342
Once I've left, I can't go back.

206
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,781
I've waited as long as I can.
Now go!

207
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,910
What is she doing here?
She's seen us.

208
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:39,220
Stupid girl.
Why have you come back?

209
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,625
Your perfect chance to escape!

210
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,549
Get in!

211
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,063
- Koichi, please.
- Look at us.

212
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,420
Sneaking around like criminals.

213
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:53,748
- Koichi, don't...
- It's degrading.

214
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,747
What's going on?

215
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,344
Koichi.

216
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,184
Who's there?

217
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,310
Go! Now! Go!

218
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,541
Show your face.

219
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,907
Look, <i>Okasan</i>! I caught her stealing!

220
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,263
She was running away
with her sister, the whore!

221
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,426
You little thief!

222
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,508
No! She is lying!

223
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:34,703
- After all we have done for her!
- I saw her with a man! Right there!

224
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,343
His name is Koichi!

225
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,622
Shut up!
We should kick her out!

226
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,587
Take her arms.

227
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,829
You are never to see him again.

228
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:16,144
What do you think?
A geisha is free to love?

229
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,863
Never.

230
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,462
Bolt the gate!

231
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,503
No one is leaving this <i>okiya.</i>

232
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,709
Dr. Moro is very expensive.

233
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:49,420
You seem to be racking up
quite a debt.

234
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,385
Kimono destroyed...

235
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,943
...geisha school...

236
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,620
...rice and pickles, train ticket,
Mr. Bekku.

237
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:04,346
All this on top of the money
I paid Mr. Tanaka.

238
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,982
And for what?

239
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:12,220
And now I hear that your sister
has run away.

240
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:18,583
She didn't wait for you.
And now she can never come back.

241
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:22,385
You must forget
you ever had a sister.

242
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,628
We are your only family now.

243
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:06,070
" Dear Satsu and little Chiyo:

244
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:09,740
As one who was once
an orphan child myself...

245
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:12,623
...this humble person
is sorry to inform you...

246
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:16,869
...that six weeks after you left
for your new life in Miyako...

247
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:21,264
...the suffering of your
honoured mother came to its end.

248
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:24,629
And only a few weeks afterward...

249
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:28,505
...your honoured father
departed this world as well.

250
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:32,824
This humble person feels confident
both your honoured parents...

251
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:36,943
...have found their places
in paradise. But happily<i>..."</i>

252
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,378
<i>At the temple...</i>

253
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:43,505
<i>... there is a poem called "Loss"</i>
<i>carved into the stone.</i>

254
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,380
<i>It has three words.</i>

255
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:49,423
<i>But the poet</i>
<i>has scratched them out.</i>

256
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,705
<i>You cannot read "Loss."</i>

257
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,582
<i>Only feel it.</i>

258
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:59,782
<i>My father and mother</i>
<i>had left this life.</i>

259
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:03,706
<i>My sister, I never heard of again.</i>

260
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:10,299
<i>I had dishonoured the</i> okiya<i>,</i>
<i>so Mother had other plans for me.</i>

261
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,861
<i>I would pay back my debt...</i>

262
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:16,380
<i>... year after year after year.</i>

263
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,666
<i>Not as a geisha.</i>

264
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:21,100
<i>As her slave.</i>

265
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:36,868
It is too pretty a day
to be so unhappy.

266
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,949
Did you fall down?

267
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,742
Why so shy?

268
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:50,542
Nothing to be ashamed of.
We all stumble from time to time.

269
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,580
You see that enchanting lady
in green?

270
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:58,908
Once, when she was just a <i>maiko</i>,
she fell clean off her wooden shoes.

271
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,222
It's true, I did.

272
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:05,103
And now look at her. So elegant.

273
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:08,507
Mr. Chairman, shouldn't we hurry?
We will miss the beginning.

274
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:12,100
We see the Spring Dances every year.
We can spare a moment.

275
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,267
What's your name?

276
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,465
Don't be afraid to look at me.

277
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:29,545
Do you like sweet plum or cherry?

278
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,021
You mean, to eat?

279
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,985
I like sweet plum myself.

280
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,464
Come.

281
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,980
None of us find as much kindness
in this life as we should.

282
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,381
Hi. Both kinds, please.

283
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,179
My children wait for these
every spring.

284
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,625
Now I'm a geisha too.

285
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,941
And so you are.

286
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,780
How did you come by
such surprising eyes?

287
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:21,187
My mother gave them to me.

288
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,587
Generous of her, wasn't it?

289
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:26,260
As you have been to me.

290
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,021
Smile for me, won't you?

291
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:35,182
There, now. That is your gift to me.

292
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:42,542
This will buy your supper.

293
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,342
Now, promise me one thing:

294
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:48,259
Next time you take a tumble,
no frowns.

295
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,623
That's better.

296
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,063
<i>In that moment...</i>

297
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:07,945
<i>... I changed from a girl</i>
<i>facing nothing but emptiness...</i>

298
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:11,028
<i>... to someone with purpose.</i>

299
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,145
<i>I saw that to be a geisha...</i>

300
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:17,740
<i>... could be a stepping stone</i>
<i>to something else:</i>

301
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,066
<i>A place in his world.</i>

302
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,780
<i>The money the Chairman</i>
<i>had given me...</i>

303
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:53,426
<i>... could have bought fish and rice</i>
<i>for a month.</i>

304
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,064
<i>But I gave it back in prayer...</i>

305
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,909
<i>... keeping only his handkerchief.</i>

306
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:07,979
<i>I asked one day</i>
<i>to become a geisha.</i>

307
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:12,830
<i>And then, somehow,</i>
<i>to meet him again.</i>

308
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:13,706
<i>And then, somehow,</i>
<i>to meet him again.</i>

309
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,658
<i>The Imperial War Ministry</i>
<i>announces news:</i>

310
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:48,146
<i>A great victory for our friend</i>
<i>Adolf Hitler.</i>

311
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,545
<i>Today, Hitler demanded</i>
<i>self-determination...</i>

312
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,945
<i>... for Germans living in Austria.</i>

313
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:56,142
<i>Hitler's quest for</i> lebensraum<i>,</i>
<i>"living space"...</i>

314
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:58,779
Chiyo-chan, I can't find my comb!
Did you find it yet?

315
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,787
Pumpkin, it's time to go.

316
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:04,585
- I found it.
- <i>Arigato</i>, Chiyo.

317
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:09,147
Oh, I couldn't sleep last night,
I was so worried about my stupid hair.

318
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:11,181
Am I lopsided?

319
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,108
You look beautiful.

320
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,426
With your hair like that...

321
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:18,747
...you look more like a pumpkin
than ever.

322
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,748
Don't poke your neck forward
like a tortoise.

323
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,669
She's not ready? We will be late.

324
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:29,864
Poor Pumpkin. Her debut,
and everyone will be staring at you.

325
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,539
- Hurry up, huh?
- This time...

326
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,820
...tune your shamisen
before you play.

327
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:41,660
When you make a fool of yourself,
your big sister gets the blame.

328
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,543
Stop crying, your face will run.

329
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,229
Pumpkin!

330
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:15,139
Pumpkin!

331
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:55,659
<i>The winter I turned 15,</i>
<i>I saw the Chairman again.</i>

332
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:00,498
<i>But that wasn't the only surprise</i>
<i>fate brought me that season.</i>

333
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:05,906
<i>Along with the snow</i>
<i>came a most unexpected visitor.</i>

334
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:14,105
Why is she here?

335
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,184
Chiyo! Chiyo!

336
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:19,221
Open the gate!

337
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:46,580
<i>Now that your beloved</i>
<i>Granny is gone...</i>

338
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,462
<i>... you'll have no need for a maid.</i>

339
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:53,027
I would never question
the great Mameha...

340
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:57,625
...but you could choose anyone
in the <i>hanamachi</i>.

341
00:43:57,830 --> 00:43:59,786
You flatter me, truly.

342
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:04,268
I'd give you my Pumpkin if she were
not already tied to Hatsumomo.

343
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:07,143
Please. I would never dream
of asking.

344
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:12,987
Besides, I could always sell Chiyo
to Mrs. Tatsuyo.

345
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:15,863
With your eye for beauty
and nose for talent...

346
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:19,302
...surely you can see
what a terrible waste that would be.

347
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:24,664
If you were not the kind-hearted
geisha I know you to be...

348
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:29,898
...then I might think you were
scheming against Hatsumomo.

349
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:36,659
Then I'm grateful, Mrs. Nitta, that
you don't have a suspicious mind.

350
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:39,424
Perhaps you can pique
my interest with...

351
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:40,779
Yes?

352
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:42,899
...your offer.

353
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:47,468
I will cover Chiyo's schooling,
all her expenses...

354
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:50,185
...till after her debut.

355
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:54,220
Now I am confident you are teasing.

356
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:57,145
I could not be more sincere.

357
00:44:57,350 --> 00:45:01,309
If Chiyo hasn't repaid her debt
within six months after her debut...

358
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:04,183
Impossible! Too little time.

359
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:06,028
- Then I will pay you twice over.

360
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:07,743
What?

361
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:13,462
No geisha could ever<i>...</i>

362
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:17,466
I am certain you will not object
to one trivial condition.

363
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:19,948
Yes?

364
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:23,546
If Chiyo erases her debt
in the time allowed...

365
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:26,664
...you will have no part
in her future earnings.

366
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:34,023
It's too good to be true.
Mameha is up to something.

367
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:37,779
She isn't in it for the money.
That much is for certain.

368
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:41,585
Rumour has it, ever since the prime
minister bought her <i>mizuage...</i>

369
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:43,189
...she's been rich.

370
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:48,066
That so? Absurd to think
she noticed Chiyo.

371
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:49,862
It's that kimono.

372
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:52,345
She remembers
how you destroyed it.

373
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:57,102
- Now she wants to get even.
- An odd picture, isn't it?

374
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:02,100
Hatsumomo sweeping into teahouse
after teahouse with our little Pumpkin.

375
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:04,985
And Mameha with our maid.

376
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:08,742
I'm so far behind.
I will never catch up to you.

377
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:10,747
Don't worry, Chiyo-chan.
I will help you.

378
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:12,349
Pumpkin!

379
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:21,781
You are never to speak to her again.

380
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:23,503
Now you are rivals.

381
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:35,662
Pumpkin.

382
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:38,063
Pumpkin.

383
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:48,988
<i>This is how it was,</i>
<i>this tiny world of women.</i>

384
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:51,704
<i>Friend turned against friend.</i>

385
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:56,741
<i>And now the two greatest geisha</i>
<i>in Miyako at war over me.</i>

386
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:58,702
<i>Hatsumomo at my back.</i>

387
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:01,982
<i>Mameha calling,</i>
<i>offering me the chance...</i>

388
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:06,502
<i>... to become one of those elegant</i>
<i>women I'd seen on the bridge...</i>

389
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:12,222
<i>... floating in a silk kimono,</i>
<i>the Chairman at my side.</i>

390
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:15,828
Chiyo is my new protégée.

391
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:20,705
As lovely as her big sister.

392
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:23,062
And with eyes the colour of rain.

393
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:31,069
The Baron is a very special man
to me. My <i>danna.</i>

394
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:34,865
Someday, if you are fortunate,
you will have a patron too.

395
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:41,305
Don't kneel. You are not
a servant girl anymore.

396
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:49,182
Step into the light.

397
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:55,787
I see water in you.

398
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:57,941
Does that displease you?

399
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:59,708
Water is powerful.

400
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:03,823
It can wash away earth,
put out fire and even destroy iron.

401
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:07,827
But you have not drawn
on those strengths, have you?

402
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:10,305
About your kimono<i>...</i>

403
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:13,225
You may apologize if you wish.

404
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:16,344
Why, that is a perfect bow...

405
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:18,222
...for a pig farmer.

406
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:21,938
Don't drop your head.
Fingertips together.

407
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:25,460
Elbows in. No weight on the hands.

408
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:27,264
Yes.

409
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:30,981
As for the kimono,
I'm no fool, Chiyo.

410
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:33,306
Hatsumomo cannot
tolerate competition.

411
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,787
She is jealous of you?

412
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:38,426
Not me, I'm afraid.

413
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:40,143
Someone closer to home.

414
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:44,144
Rise.

415
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:48,022
Not like a horse.

416
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:54,142
Slide your foot forward.

417
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:58,580
That's it. Now walk.

418
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:00,940
You are a magnificent geisha.

419
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:07,062
Tell me, Chiyo, does Mrs. Nitta
ever speak of the future?

420
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:08,783
Not to me.

421
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:11,379
Well, someday soon,
she will have to name an heir.

422
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:14,150
One of her own geisha
to succeed her.

423
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:17,501
Strange, isn't it,
she has not adopted Hatsumomo.

424
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:20,702
That would be like releasing
the tiger from its cage.

425
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:23,545
You have a gift for expression.

426
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:26,783
And if Mrs. Nitta adopts Pumpkin...

427
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:29,341
...that is hardly a threat.

428
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:32,588
But a young girl
with eyes like rain<i>...</i>

429
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:35,220
But Mrs. Nitta would never
choose me.

430
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:38,547
On the contrary, that is our goal.

431
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,661
- It is?
- Of course.

432
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:45,990
If you do not inherit the <i>okiya</i>,
then we will all be at the tiger's mercy.

433
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:51,907
Water's always in such a hurry.

434
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:55,065
Perhaps it is just as well.

435
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:57,420
We have no time to lose.

436
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:04,225
<i>We must transform you.</i>

437
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:08,868
<i>And what takes years,</i>
<i>you must learn in months.</i>

438
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:17,186
Say I'm entertaining the Baron.

439
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:21,019
Like so many clients, he's trapped
in an arranged marriage.

440
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:24,506
So in the teahouse, when he's
seeking my company instead...

441
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:27,019
...I reward him like this:

442
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:29,221
With a glimpse of my wrist.

443
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:33,539
Seeing this demure little trace
of naked skin<i>...</i>

444
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:36,469
Well, it gives him pleasure.

445
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:40,022
Or when you're sitting down...

446
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:43,540
...for the briefest moment,
press your leg against his.

447
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:46,503
Always by accident, of course.

448
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:06,100
<i>Mameha, when does a geisha</i>
<i>choose her</i> danna?

449
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:08,426
<i>I'm afraid it's the other way around.</i>

450
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:10,541
<i>Focus on your studies, Chiyo.</i>

451
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:13,310
<i>Music, the art of conversation.</i>

452
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:16,024
<i>That's the surest way</i>
<i>to attract a</i> danna.

453
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:19,142
<i>On your feet, not off them.</i>

454
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:56,338
<i>Remember, Chiyo,</i>
<i>geisha are not courtesans.</i>

455
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,586
<i>And we are not wives.</i>

456
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:02,385
<i>We sell our skills,</i>
<i>not our bodies.</i>

457
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:05,664
<i>We create another secret world.</i>

458
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:08,589
<i>A place only of beauty.</i>

459
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:12,827
<i>The very word "geisha"</i>
<i>means "artist."</i>

460
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:17,945
<i>And to be a geisha is to be judged</i>
<i>as a moving work of art.</i>

461
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:26,419
<i>Agony and beauty, for us,</i>
<i>live side by side.</i>

462
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:31,862
<i>Your feet will suffer,</i>
<i>your fingers will bleed.</i>

463
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:35,426
<i>Even sitting and sleeping</i>
<i>will be painful.</i>

464
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:46,138
<i>You cannot call yourself</i>
<i>a true geisha...</i>

465
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:49,626
<i>... until you can stop a man</i>
<i>in his tracks with a single look.</i>

466
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:52,181
No one can do that.

467
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:54,108
Choose someone for me.

468
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:58,388
The grey hat.

469
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:22,426
<i>Choose someone for me,</i> Onei- san.

470
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:25,464
The boy on the bike, with one look.

471
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,549
You are ready.

472
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:28,144
Hurry up!

473
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:32,628
You are not making money
standing there gawking at yourself.

474
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:35,909
For luck!

475
00:55:57,670 --> 00:56:01,140
This binds us together forever
as sisters.

476
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:04,820
Today you leave your childhood
and cast away your name.

477
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:08,865
From this day forward,
you will be known as:

478
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:10,947
"Sayuri<i>."</i>

479
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:18,621
<i>When Mameha granted me</i>
<i>my new name...</i>

480
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:24,382
<i>... I felt little Chiyo disappear</i>
<i>behind a white mask with red lips.</i>

481
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:27,141
<i>I was a</i> maiko <i>now.</i>

482
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,466
<i>An apprentice geisha.</i>

483
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:33,905
<i>From that moment, I told myself:</i>

484
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:37,705
<i>"When I make tea,</i>
<i>when I pour</i> sake...

485
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:41,505
<i>... when I dance,</i>
<i>when I tie my obi...</i>

486
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:44,065
<i>... it will be for the Chairman.</i>

487
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:46,700
<i>Until he finds me.</i>

488
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:49,146
<i>Until I am his. "</i>

489
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:03,709
Ready?

490
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:08,663
Thank you.

491
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:15,223
Friends...

492
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:19,343
...we have the pleasure to witness
the debut of a new <i>maiko.</i>

493
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:36,065
I remember those eyes.

494
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:37,982
What was her name?

495
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:41,185
Sayuri.

496
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:01,109
Determined, isn't she?

497
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:05,622
If there'd been a drop of tea in that pot,
Sayuri would have gotten it out.

498
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:09,779
Don't tease, Baron,
it is her very first time.

499
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:10,101
What a beautiful dance,
yes, Pumpkin?

500
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:13,298
Her fans are so hypnotic...

501
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:16,343
...that you never notice her feet.

502
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:22,020
- What's her name?
- Her name is Sayuri.

503
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:25,745
Sayuri? A name as sweet
as she is.

504
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:28,501
I'm afraid these days...

505
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:32,419
...even a common chambermaid
can call herself a geisha.

506
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:37,863
So it's nice to see such
a sincere young <i>maiko.</i> Isn't it?

507
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:39,549
Why, yes.

508
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,627
Surely you would like
to thank Hatsumomo...

509
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:44,025
...for her gracious compliments.

510
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:47,861
There is so much I would like
to say to Hatsumomo.

511
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:51,301
Sometimes the smartest remark
is silence.

512
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:55,706
What better advice to follow
than your own?

513
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:57,263
Sayuri.

514
00:59:57,470 --> 01:00:00,746
- I was a <i>maiko</i> myself once.
- Of course.

515
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:04,420
But it's been such a very long...

516
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:08,669
...long, long, long time.

517
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:21,378
I shall destroy you.

518
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:27,705
<i>She can destroy you.</i>
<i>She will spread rumours...</i>

519
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:31,220
<i>... stalk you from teahouse</i>
<i>to teahouse, then steal your clients.</i>

520
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:34,263
All in the hope that Mrs. Nitta
adopts Pumpkin instead of you.

521
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:36,540
- What can we do?
- We've got to outwit her.

522
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:38,900
To find a place somewhere
beyond her reach...

523
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:42,068
...where you can practice your skills
without any interference.

524
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:45,103
- Your first sumo match.
- What?

525
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,625
Today you will meet
lwamura Ken.

526
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:50,947
He is head of the lwamura Electric
Company in Osaka.

527
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:53,061
My client for years.

528
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:56,342
We will entertain him
and his partner, Nobu.

529
01:00:56,550 --> 01:00:59,018
We may find Nobu
quite a challenge.

530
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:01,300
He does not like geisha.

531
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:12,659
Be attentive. I will do the rest.

532
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:19,104
Chairman lwamura. President Nobu.

533
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:21,778
This is my new younger sister, Sayuri.

534
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:22,979
Nobu-san.

535
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:27,389
Nobu-san.

536
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:34,260
Injured in Manchuria. War hero.

537
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:36,745
Sayuri, is this your first sumo match?

538
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:41,785
Nobu-san will have to educate you.
I cannot tell one wrestler from the next.

539
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:45,460
That is the Chairman's diplomatic way
of saying he hates sumo.

540
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:53,620
Did you notice our contribution?

541
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:55,628
We are harnessing
the power of water...

542
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:58,549
...to bring electricity
to some of the smaller villages.

543
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:01,787
- It was in the newspapers, wasn't it?
- With the Chairman's picture.

544
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:05,778
You compensate for all
my shortcomings, don't you?

545
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:10,708
May I ask, how does someone
harness the power of water?

546
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:14,744
You should never ask an engineer
to explain a thing, because he will...

547
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:16,981
Let the girl watch sumo.

548
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:30,628
Hatsumomo, that snake.
Quick, turn your attention to Nobu.

549
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:32,578
But, Mameha-neisan...

550
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:35,702
Hatsumomo finds him repulsive.
She'd never steal him away.

551
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:38,378
Mislead her. Go.

552
01:02:55,270 --> 01:03:00,344
Perhaps Nobu-san will be kind enough
to explain the rules of the match.

553
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:07,060
Three things matter in life:
Sumo, business and war.

554
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:09,306
Understand one,
you know them all.

555
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:11,387
But why should a geisha care?

556
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:14,468
You spend your time
plucking strings and dancing.

557
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:19,101
I humbly beg to differ.

558
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:21,744
What is sumo
but a dance between giants?

559
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:25,581
What is business
but a dance between companies?

560
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:29,066
I'd like to know about
every kind of dance.

561
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:35,709
They are throwing salt
to purify the ring.

562
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:49,741
That man is Miyagiyama,
the greatest fighter in Japan.

563
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:51,588
But he's so tiny.

564
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:54,460
Only compared to his opponent.

565
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,588
Miyagiyama may use <i>hataki komi.</i>

566
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:02,268
Are you listening?

567
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:04,223
Yes.

568
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:10,581
<i>Hataki komi</i> is a movement
the smaller combatant uses...

569
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:13,782
...to throw the larger man
off balance.

570
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:16,743
Victory does not always belong
to the powerful.

571
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:19,946
Look. There.

572
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,418
In his eyes.

573
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:26,626
I'm afraid our time
has come to a close.

574
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:30,584
- Going so soon?
- Not yet. I want her to see.

575
01:04:49,070 --> 01:04:50,947
Now that is <i>hataki komi</i>!

576
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:53,220
I see now why you like sumo.

577
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:57,389
You can never judge a man's power
by his appearance alone.

578
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:02,943
Mameha.

579
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:06,026
You may bring her again.

580
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:27,224
<i>I scoured the newspaper</i>
<i>for the Chairman's photograph.</i>

581
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:31,345
<i>Anything to preserve</i>
<i>our moment together.</i>

582
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:33,868
<i>A moment stolen...</i>

583
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:38,019
<i>... when I was forced</i>
<i>to turn my attention to Nobu.</i>

584
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:42,185
<i>In that instant, I felt the world shift.</i>

585
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:45,589
<i>But not my own determination.</i>

586
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:48,586
<i>I made a secret promise:</i>

587
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:52,909
<i>Along with his picture,</i>
<i>I would lock away my heart...</i>

588
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:55,705
<i>... and save it for him.</i>

589
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:03,784
Come in.

590
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:08,502
Tonight we will deliver a quick blow
to Hatsumomo.

591
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:11,822
- How?
- We will meet Nobu-san...

592
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:13,463
...at the Tsunashima restaurant.

593
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:16,628
But first, a visit to Dr. Crab.

594
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:18,582
- Dr. Crab?
- It's a little nickname...

595
01:06:18,790 --> 01:06:20,667
...he's earned over the years.

596
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:22,861
Hold still.

597
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:26,709
I have something in mind. A plan.

598
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:29,462
Now cut your leg
where I've marked it.

599
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:32,184
- What?
- Or I will do it for you...

600
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:34,108
Have you gone mad?

601
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:36,945
Do you trust me or don't you?

602
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:40,029
Well?

603
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:50,106
Go ahead, do it.

604
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:00,941
Careless with the sewing scissors,
were you?

605
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:04,822
Right through your beautiful kimono.
Such a pity.

606
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:06,748
It won't leave a scar, will it?

607
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:12,505
Sayuri is a special girl
at a very special time in her life.

608
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:16,144
Yes.

609
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:21,470
With those eyes,
you must be quite a commodity.

610
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:28,989
Clean cut.

611
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:32,429
Won't leave a mark, I promise.

612
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:37,148
But I had best prescribe
a bit of antiseptic.

613
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:56,825
<i>Your honourable sister says,</i>
<i>"Cut your leg," you cut your leg.</i>

614
01:07:57,030 --> 01:08:00,500
<i>She says, "Follow me,"</i>
<i>you follow her.</i>

615
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:02,905
<i>My life had turned into a game...</i>

616
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:05,305
<i>... and only she knew the rules.</i>

617
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:12,504
<i>Ekubo.</i> At the right moment,
slip it to Nobu discreetly.

618
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:17,466
He will know what it means.

619
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:25,382
- You have kept us waiting.
- Please, forgive us, Nobu-san.

620
01:08:28,510 --> 01:08:31,308
The Chairman thinks I should
take more pleasure in life.

621
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:33,068
Music and the theatre.

622
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:35,147
What is your impression?

623
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:40,658
It is useless
to push a cart sideways.

624
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:44,545
One could not wish Nobu-san
to be anyone but Nobu-san.

625
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:46,748
I could not agree more.

626
01:08:47,110 --> 01:08:48,748
I owe this man everything.

627
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:51,550
He gives me too much credit,
as usual.

628
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:53,183
Probably.

629
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:03,868
It is a trinket.

630
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:06,345
I found it a few days ago.

631
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:11,823
Nobu-san. I had no idea
you were so sentimental.

632
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:13,549
Call it my new leaf.

633
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:18,624
My mother<i>...</i>

634
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:22,661
My mother, she used to wear
something similar.

635
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:27,188
You do not like it?

636
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:34,420
Forgive me. I've never received
a present before.

637
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:40,106
What a beautiful comb.

638
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:45,303
Such a joyous moment, Sayuri.

639
01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:48,343
You are finally getting
what you des<i>erve.</i>

640
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:50,269
How lovely.

641
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:55,061
And now, will you excuse us,
please?

642
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:57,738
We have another engagement.

643
01:09:57,990 --> 01:09:59,548
Many, in fact.

644
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:03,062
Pumpkin.

645
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:18,388
You are most kind.

646
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:32,541
Now, give this one to Dr. Crab.

647
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:35,218
- Mameha, please.
- You're upset?

648
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:38,502
I want to trust you, I do. But you
have to tell me what's going on.

649
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:40,428
I am ensuring your future.

650
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:42,905
But tell me how. I beg you.

651
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:45,102
I'm trying to orchestrate
a bidding war.

652
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:47,904
- What for?
- Your most precious attribute.

653
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:50,829
- And what is that?
- Your <i>mizuage.</i>

654
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:55,540
Did Mother ever tell you
about the eel in the cave?

655
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:57,661
Well, every once in a while...

656
01:10:57,870 --> 01:11:01,624
...a man's eel likes to visit
a woman's cave.

657
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:04,061
- Yes, I know.
- You do?

658
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:06,420
I live with Hatsumomo.

659
01:11:07,870 --> 01:11:10,464
Your cave is untouched.
Men like that.

660
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:12,183
We call this <i>mizuage.</i>

661
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:15,826
And to become a full geisha,
you must sell it to the highest bidder.

662
01:11:16,030 --> 01:11:17,463
Did you sell yours?

663
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:20,980
The largest sum ever paid.
Ten thousand yen.

664
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:23,226
I freed myself from debt.

665
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:25,148
And so will you.

666
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:28,220
When you slip the rice cake
to Dr. Crab...

667
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:32,423
...it is a sign that says
your <i>mizuage</i> is ripe for sale.

668
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:37,507
The doctor has no desire
to see you tonight.

669
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,382
Or any night.

670
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:48,658
Pumpkin. Hatsumomo
went to see Dr. Crab, yes?

671
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:50,428
I have to go, Chiyo-chan.

672
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:52,905
- Didn't she?
- I do not know.

673
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:55,544
Of course you know.
You shadow her every step.

674
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,422
You expect me to betray
my big sister?

675
01:11:57,630 --> 01:11:59,222
Has she made you cruel as well?

676
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:03,059
- No.
- My Pumpkin always told the truth.

677
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:06,308
But<i>...</i>

678
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:08,018
The truth.

679
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:16,742
Tonight we went to the teahouse
to see Dr. Crab.

680
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:19,544
I sat outside, but I could still hear
through the screen.

681
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:21,308
And Hatsumomo then said to him:

682
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:23,228
" I live in the same <i>okiya</i> as Sayuri.

683
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:26,024
Did you know that she brings men
back to her room?"

684
01:12:26,350 --> 01:12:27,703
" No," he said.

685
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:29,946
" Common sailors
and fishermen too<i>."</i>

686
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:33,023
The doctor looked queasy,
like he didn't want to hear any more.

687
01:12:33,230 --> 01:12:34,549
But she kept going.

688
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,820
And Hatsumomo said to him,
"What's the matter?

689
01:12:37,030 --> 01:12:39,066
Have I told you more
than you wanted to know?"

690
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:44,945
I'm so sorry.
I wanted to say something...

691
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:49,029
...but how could I,
Chiyo-chan? How?

692
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:51,864
Am I really like her? Am I?

693
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:54,428
Of course not.

694
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:58,825
Is Mameha-san cruel to you too?

695
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:02,422
No. She's so kind to me.

696
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:06,908
But sometimes I worry she's taking me
further from the things I want.

697
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:11,068
That man Nobu.

698
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:14,828
Do you really like him?

699
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:18,581
- No.
- That's what I thought.

700
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:21,419
Do you like somebody else?

701
01:13:30,950 --> 01:13:34,579
Don't worry about me,
Chiyo-chan, I'll be fine.

702
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:36,189
Better than fine.

703
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:38,108
Mother plans to adopt me...

704
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:42,906
...so my dream of having someplace
to live out my life may come true.

705
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:44,784
I have to go.

706
01:13:53,230 --> 01:13:54,629
We could still win, Sayuri.

707
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:58,584
How? Hatsumomo has poisoned
Dr. Crab against me.

708
01:13:58,790 --> 01:14:02,260
Forget about him. There are plenty
of other fish in the sea.

709
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:04,620
- The Chairman has been kind...
- Sayuri.

710
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:06,900
Nobu and the Chairman
are business partners.

711
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:09,465
They would never bid
against one another.

712
01:14:09,670 --> 01:14:11,979
It is time we cast a wider net.

713
01:14:13,190 --> 01:14:17,706
<i>Suppose there was a night in Miyako,</i>
<i>hundreds of men, all in one place...</i>

714
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:20,185
<i>...eager to bid for you.</i>
<i>- What do you mean</i>?

715
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:23,382
<i>Where you are the object</i>
<i>of all their fantasies.</i>

716
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:26,104
<i>The most famous geisha</i>
<i>in the</i> hanamachi.

717
01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:29,222
<i>- But I'm not.</i>
<i>- You will be.</i>

718
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:40,745
Who is responsible for this?

719
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:42,668
Ask Mameha.

720
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:44,940
I'm asking you, <i>Okasan.</i>

721
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:46,868
How come Sayuri
gets to be the lead?

722
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:50,585
It's your own fault.
You should practice more.

723
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:55,868
What did Mameha do?

724
01:14:58,150 --> 01:15:01,142
Speak to the director in private?

725
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:05,780
Not every geisha
uses that kind of currency.

726
01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:12,466
I'm looking forward
to your performance.

727
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:18,108
You know how I adore
watching you dance, Chiyo.

728
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:51,189
They've all come.

729
01:15:51,390 --> 01:15:53,460
The Baron, Nobu-san...

730
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:57,948
...our beloved Hatsumomo
and that dapper General of hers.

731
01:15:58,470 --> 01:15:59,869
Anybody else?

732
01:16:00,070 --> 01:16:03,142
And even your old friend, Dr. Crab.

733
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:17,782
What if I dance poorly?

734
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:21,426
What if I disgrace myself
and no one takes interest...?

735
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:24,828
You will be glorious.

736
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:40,985
Now it's time.

737
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:47,548
Sayuri, you remember the doctor.

738
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:50,423
I hope my performance
pleased you, doctor.

739
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:53,940
Oh, you dance
with such profound feeling.

740
01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:55,868
I most humbly thank you.

741
01:19:56,070 --> 01:19:58,903
It seems you've once again
caught the doctor's interest.

742
01:19:59,110 --> 01:20:00,828
And I am most grateful.

743
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:03,942
- If you have heard any gossip...
- Yes?

744
01:20:04,150 --> 01:20:06,903
...then I hope you will follow
your own advice.

745
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:10,263
And what would that be, pray tell?

746
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:13,782
Seek a second opinion.

747
01:20:23,550 --> 01:20:24,869
Chairman.

748
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:28,028
Sayuri gave such a passionate
performance, don't you think?

749
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:29,663
Indeed.

750
01:20:29,870 --> 01:20:32,668
Mameha, did you invite the Chairman
to my estate this weekend?

751
01:20:33,670 --> 01:20:35,547
It's my annual blossom-viewing party.

752
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:39,504
Baron, I told you I can't go.
I have an urgent appointment.

753
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:41,940
Taking care of a little nuisance?

754
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:45,142
Or was that a naughty secret?

755
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:48,183
Baron, wouldn't Sayuri
look stunning...

756
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:51,063
...among the flowers
on your estate?

757
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:54,707
Yes, very pretty.
Be sure to send her along.

758
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:56,987
With a chaperone, of course.

759
01:20:57,430 --> 01:21:00,308
I'm certain Mr. Bekku will oblige.

760
01:21:00,870 --> 01:21:04,829
That's a fine idea, Baron.
But Sayuri is required at the theatre.

761
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:07,749
Mameha, I expect her there.

762
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:10,744
Nobu. Coming Saturday?

763
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:15,228
All that way to see a cherry tree?
I will leave that to the Chairman.

764
01:21:16,390 --> 01:21:19,223
Wonderful tonight.
Excuse me.

765
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:25,300
If you would rather not go<i>...</i>

766
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:28,505
I'd like to go very much.

767
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:31,865
Then be on your guard,
every moment.

768
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:35,382
<i>There is a reason Hatsumomo</i>
<i>wants you there.</i>

769
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:37,865
<i>Trust me, I know my Baron, Sayuri.</i>

770
01:21:38,070 --> 01:21:40,823
<i>He has a weakness</i>
<i>for beautiful women.</i>

771
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:46,627
<i>And now you are the most</i>
<i>celebrated geisha in all Miyako.</i>

772
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:49,464
<i>The most desired as well.</i>

773
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:28,739
Pardon. Pardon me.
Pardon me. Sayuri.

774
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:32,579
Today, even the cherry blossoms
are envious of her.

775
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:44,504
There's something I've been wanting
to say to you for some time now.

776
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:47,229
I'd like to<i>...</i>

777
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:52,510
To thank you for your attention
to Nobu-san.

778
01:22:52,870 --> 01:22:55,862
Nobu can be a difficult man.
So severe.

779
01:22:56,070 --> 01:22:59,142
Hates parties, <i>sake</i>
only in moderation.

780
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:01,625
And he disdains geisha.

781
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:03,544
But he...

782
01:23:04,310 --> 01:23:05,948
He's fond of you.

783
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:11,183
Because you admire him,
I respect him more.

784
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:15,540
He will never tell you himself.
He's far too modest.

785
01:23:16,670 --> 01:23:18,626
We were fighting
in Manchuria together.

786
01:23:18,830 --> 01:23:20,741
There was an explosion.

787
01:23:20,950 --> 01:23:23,384
He protected me
from the worst of it.

788
01:23:24,030 --> 01:23:28,228
As you might imagine,
I owe him quite a debt.

789
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:30,747
Nobu has taught me a great deal.

790
01:23:30,950 --> 01:23:32,827
Patience, for one thing.

791
01:23:33,030 --> 01:23:35,669
I, in turn, have tried to teach him...

792
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:38,430
...you have to savour life
while you can.

793
01:23:38,630 --> 01:23:41,144
The lesson of the cherry blossom.

794
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:43,386
That is why Nobu likes you.

795
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:45,820
We must not expect
happiness, Sayuri.

796
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:48,665
It is not something we des<i>erve.</i>

797
01:23:48,910 --> 01:23:51,788
When life goes well,
it's a sudden gift.

798
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:53,946
It cannot last forever.

799
01:24:01,230 --> 01:24:02,788
Sayuri.

800
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:07,026
There you are.
I have a present for you.

801
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:17,105
Mameha asked me to show you
my kimono collection.

802
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:19,142
It's quite venerated.

803
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:23,059
My grandfather and father
collected kimono before me.

804
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:27,547
I've given a number
of valuable kimono to Mameha.

805
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:30,583
I like to give present
to beautiful girls.

806
01:24:33,830 --> 01:24:35,149
It's for you.

807
01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:42,104
Come. Have a closer look.

808
01:24:47,030 --> 01:24:48,668
Isn't it lovely?

809
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:53,458
Try it on.

810
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:58,108
The Baron is too kind.

811
01:24:58,790 --> 01:25:03,386
I will happily try it on with Mameha
when the Baron returns to Miyako.

812
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:05,182
Who knows when that will be?

813
01:25:05,390 --> 01:25:07,779
Put it on now. Don't be shy.

814
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:15,149
Don't worry.

815
01:25:15,390 --> 01:25:19,303
I am experienced in knotting obis.
And untying them as well.

816
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:24,308
Please. Mr. Bekku is waiting.

817
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:26,029
Bekku is waiting for no one.

818
01:25:29,510 --> 01:25:30,738
Please!

819
01:25:33,110 --> 01:25:34,259
Stop!

820
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:42,818
Please!

821
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:44,668
Stop now!

822
01:26:07,590 --> 01:26:09,103
Sayuri...

823
01:26:09,830 --> 01:26:11,183
...I only want to have a look.

824
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:14,428
No harm in that.

825
01:26:15,590 --> 01:26:17,581
Any man would do the same.

826
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:28,986
<i>I heard a message on the wind.</i>

827
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:31,068
So careless.

828
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:34,262
- You have ruined all our plans.
- I did nothing.

829
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:38,258
Please, Sayuri, do not insult me.
I know the Baron better than that.

830
01:27:38,470 --> 01:27:39,619
He gave me a kimono.

831
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:42,902
- You sold yourself for a kimono.
- I did not sell myself!

832
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:45,499
Today is the day I accept bids
for your <i>mizuage.</i>

833
01:27:45,710 --> 01:27:47,587
What kind of price
can I hope to demand...

834
01:27:47,790 --> 01:27:49,508
...with a finger pointed at your back?

835
01:27:49,710 --> 01:27:52,144
He looked at me,
that's all, <i>Onei-san.</i>

836
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:54,466
You will be examined
at the <i>mizuage</i> ceremony.

837
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:56,262
If you are found to be worthless<i>...</i>

838
01:27:56,470 --> 01:27:58,700
I am not worthless!

839
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:03,220
I am not worthless.

840
01:28:15,830 --> 01:28:19,618
How much longer is this bidding
going to take?

841
01:28:19,870 --> 01:28:24,990
Besides, who wants a plum when
someone has already had a bite?

842
01:28:42,190 --> 01:28:43,703
What is it?

843
01:28:44,350 --> 01:28:46,420
Twenty yen? Thirty?

844
01:28:46,630 --> 01:28:48,985
This can't be the right amount.

845
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:52,819
I trust you agree.
I have won the wager.

846
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:56,028
Sayuri's made history.

847
01:28:56,230 --> 01:29:00,508
No <i>mizuage</i> has ever been sold
for more. Not even mine.

848
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:03,062
Fifteen thousand yen.

849
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:05,308
Unbelievable.

850
01:29:07,910 --> 01:29:11,380
Of course, none of it will go
to Sayuri.

851
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:15,902
Or to you, Mameha.
It goes to this <i>okiya.</i>

852
01:29:16,230 --> 01:29:19,506
All 15,000 yen to this estate.

853
01:29:19,910 --> 01:29:21,901
I do not understand.

854
01:29:22,110 --> 01:29:27,104
That Sayuri will inherit
as my adopted daughter.

855
01:29:27,430 --> 01:29:30,149
- What?
- You wouldn't dare.

856
01:29:30,350 --> 01:29:32,989
I'm entitled to do as I choose.

857
01:29:33,190 --> 01:29:36,182
But you promised
the<i> okiya</i> to Pumpkin!

858
01:29:37,510 --> 01:29:41,947
Look at her. Still a virgin <i>maiko.</i>

859
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:45,307
- Pumpkin!
- Can't you adopt us both?

860
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:48,502
Quiet, Sayuri. I'm no fool.

861
01:29:49,030 --> 01:29:51,863
Pumpkin would only be
Hatsumomo's puppet.

862
01:29:52,870 --> 01:29:57,261
How long will it take before
you kick us out onto the street?

863
01:29:57,470 --> 01:29:58,983
I have given you my life.

864
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:00,989
Yes.

865
01:30:01,190 --> 01:30:02,862
Your impudence.

866
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:04,981
Your foul temper.

867
01:30:08,510 --> 01:30:12,503
Who paid for the silk on your back?
The rice in your bowl?

868
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:15,264
The tobacco in that pipe of yours?
Who?

869
01:30:15,470 --> 01:30:19,861
Don't exaggerate!
You have never even had a <i>danna.</i>

870
01:30:20,070 --> 01:30:24,348
- Don't say it. Don't say...
- You chose that no-good Koichi.

871
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:26,586
- Stop it.
- Sneaking through your window...

872
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:29,065
...at all hours of the night.
- Quiet!

873
01:30:29,270 --> 01:30:31,545
Not like a geisha.

874
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:34,708
Like a common prostitute.

875
01:30:34,910 --> 01:30:36,423
Enough!

876
01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:40,585
Besides, you are getting old.

877
01:30:42,630 --> 01:30:44,188
But Sayuri?

878
01:30:44,470 --> 01:30:48,622
Sayuri is destined
to become a legend.

879
01:31:03,670 --> 01:31:06,343
My dear <i>Okasan.</i>

880
01:31:09,910 --> 01:31:11,866
We will s<i>ee...</i>

881
01:31:12,950 --> 01:31:14,747
...won't we?

882
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:22,342
Sayuri, your room is too small.

883
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:24,268
Take Hatsumomo's.

884
01:31:27,030 --> 01:31:31,945
From now on,
your name is Nitta Sayuri.

885
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:34,500
May I congratulate you both.

886
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:36,428
You too.

887
01:31:45,030 --> 01:31:49,308
Everything we wanted,
you made happen. Thank you.

888
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:53,786
May I ask who?

889
01:31:53,990 --> 01:31:55,708
Dr. Crab.

890
01:31:56,830 --> 01:31:58,741
Was Nobu disappointed?

891
01:31:58,950 --> 01:32:02,943
Nobu did not bid.
It was against his mighty principles.

892
01:32:05,190 --> 01:32:07,499
Dr. Crab was opposed by the Baron.

893
01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:09,709
My Baron.

894
01:32:10,110 --> 01:32:12,670
Do you want to know
the truth, Sayuri?

895
01:32:13,470 --> 01:32:15,426
He was the highest bidder.

896
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:19,259
Forgive me.
But I let it go to Dr. Crab.

897
01:32:19,470 --> 01:32:21,142
I think you understand why.

898
01:32:21,350 --> 01:32:24,342
I swear to you, I am innocent.

899
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:25,665
Of course you are.

900
01:32:26,110 --> 01:32:30,069
No man would ever bid so much
for a thing he had already taken.

901
01:32:31,310 --> 01:32:34,939
It was my own fault.
I did not protect you.

902
01:32:41,230 --> 01:32:43,983
Celebrate this moment, Sayuri.

903
01:32:44,550 --> 01:32:49,260
Tonight, the lights in the <i>hanamachi</i>
all burn for you.

904
01:34:23,870 --> 01:34:25,861
My daughter.

905
01:34:35,630 --> 01:34:37,780
You are full geisha now.

906
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:02,746
What are you doing in my room?

907
01:35:07,590 --> 01:35:10,150
I came to congratulate you.

908
01:35:12,510 --> 01:35:14,068
Please get out.

909
01:35:16,270 --> 01:35:18,147
Why, little Chiyo.

910
01:35:18,950 --> 01:35:20,986
Look what I found.

911
01:35:21,710 --> 01:35:24,861
His initials, how elegant.

912
01:35:25,070 --> 01:35:28,665
You've been hiding your love
for a long time.

913
01:35:29,670 --> 01:35:31,945
The sacrifice every geisha
must make.

914
01:35:32,150 --> 01:35:33,299
Don't!

915
01:35:54,790 --> 01:35:58,260
Isn't this where you keep it?
Next to your heart?

916
01:36:08,950 --> 01:36:10,099
Give it back!

917
01:36:17,470 --> 01:36:18,744
Give it back!

918
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:29,069
No!

919
01:36:29,270 --> 01:36:30,988
Mother!

920
01:36:31,190 --> 01:36:33,465
Pumpkin! Mother!

921
01:36:41,550 --> 01:36:43,222
Kimono!

922
01:36:47,110 --> 01:36:48,179
Kimono, Sayuri!

923
01:36:54,510 --> 01:36:56,307
Kimono! Pumpkin!

924
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:55,866
<i>I could be her.</i>

925
01:37:56,430 --> 01:37:59,263
<i>Now I am geisha to this house.</i>

926
01:38:03,110 --> 01:38:05,101
<i>I could be her.</i>

927
01:38:05,310 --> 01:38:07,585
<i>Were we so different</i>?

928
01:38:07,790 --> 01:38:09,508
<i>She loved once.</i>

929
01:38:09,710 --> 01:38:11,587
<i>She hoped once.</i>

930
01:38:13,110 --> 01:38:16,341
<i>I might be looking</i>
<i>into my own future.</i>

931
01:38:17,190 --> 01:38:20,739
<i>Until the real future</i>
<i>came falling from the air.</i>

932
01:39:30,790 --> 01:39:32,189
Stop.

933
01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:47,585
Oh, Korin. Have you seen Sayuri?

934
01:39:47,790 --> 01:39:49,621
No. I don't know.

935
01:39:59,910 --> 01:40:01,184
Chairman!

936
01:40:02,150 --> 01:40:04,425
They are sending us away,
but they won't say where.

937
01:40:04,630 --> 01:40:08,509
Osaka. But you must not go.
The city is a prime target.

938
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:10,860
Get your things, quickly.

939
01:40:12,710 --> 01:40:14,780
Nobu and I are trying
to find safe havens...

940
01:40:14,990 --> 01:40:17,788
...for as many of you
as we can. Come.

941
01:40:22,310 --> 01:40:23,709
Here.

942
01:40:24,430 --> 01:40:26,421
Work certificate. Nurse's aide.

943
01:40:26,630 --> 01:40:28,860
Friend of mine is chief surgeon
in Kameoka.

944
01:40:29,070 --> 01:40:31,425
What about Sayuri?
Can't we go together?

945
01:40:31,630 --> 01:40:34,463
Don't worry.
She will be taken care of.

946
01:40:38,390 --> 01:40:40,665
Here you are. Here we go!

947
01:40:40,870 --> 01:40:42,667
Sayuri.

948
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:44,659
Sayuri! Come.

949
01:40:46,470 --> 01:40:50,349
This is Arima.
He will take you into the hills.

950
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:53,542
Nobu has got a friend there.
A kimono-maker.

951
01:40:54,110 --> 01:40:56,908
Anyone stops you, show them this.

952
01:40:58,910 --> 01:41:01,868
- Do I have to go?
- It's remote. You will be safe.

953
01:41:04,870 --> 01:41:07,828
What about you?
You said Osaka was dangerous.

954
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:12,941
Our factory is there.
I have no choice.

955
01:41:17,030 --> 01:41:18,258
Go!

956
01:41:18,790 --> 01:41:23,022
I will express your gratitude
to Nobu-san.

957
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:45,425
<i>A year without news...</i>

958
01:41:45,630 --> 01:41:51,466
<i>... except news</i>
<i>of death, defeat, shame.</i>

959
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:57,143
<i>Rumours of cities evaporating</i>
<i>into clouds of smoke.</i>

960
01:41:57,670 --> 01:41:59,820
<i>Then another year...</i>

961
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:01,907
<i>... and then another...</i>

962
01:42:02,110 --> 01:42:05,819
<i>... until the old life is a dream life.</i>

963
01:42:06,790 --> 01:42:08,746
<i>Was I ever geisha</i>?

964
01:42:09,830 --> 01:42:11,980
<i>Did I ever dance...</i>

965
01:42:12,230 --> 01:42:14,186
<i>... holding a fan</i>?

966
01:42:14,390 --> 01:42:17,143
<i>Who would hold a fan now...</i>

967
01:42:17,350 --> 01:42:20,069
<i>... or paint their lips</i>?

968
01:42:21,790 --> 01:42:23,701
<i>And then another year.</i>

969
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:26,222
<i>Nothing.</i>

970
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:27,869
<i>Rice.</i>

971
01:42:28,070 --> 01:42:29,298
<i>Work.</i>

972
01:42:29,510 --> 01:42:31,262
<i>Rice.</i>

973
01:42:31,510 --> 01:42:32,943
<i>Work.</i>

974
01:42:33,510 --> 01:42:35,228
<i>Nothing.</i>

975
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:43,103
Sayuri!

976
01:42:45,790 --> 01:42:49,305
Sayuri! A man from Osaka
has come to see you.

977
01:43:13,630 --> 01:43:15,348
Nobu-san.

978
01:43:21,710 --> 01:43:25,464
General Tottori was captured
and tried as a war criminal.

979
01:43:25,670 --> 01:43:30,869
The Baron lost his fortune
and committed suicide.

980
01:43:31,070 --> 01:43:32,583
What about the <i>okiya</i>?

981
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:34,781
Mr. Bekku is gone, but the others...

982
01:43:34,990 --> 01:43:36,981
Auntie and Mother?

983
01:43:37,830 --> 01:43:40,344
Indestructible, as always.

984
01:43:42,230 --> 01:43:43,743
And the Chairman?

985
01:43:45,870 --> 01:43:47,940
As well as can be expected.

986
01:43:51,310 --> 01:43:54,507
This is all that remains
of our factories.

987
01:43:58,150 --> 01:44:00,186
I'm so sorry, Nobu-san.

988
01:44:02,710 --> 01:44:04,189
Sayuri<i>...</i>

989
01:44:07,990 --> 01:44:13,303
We want to rebuild, but to do that
we will need your help.

990
01:44:13,510 --> 01:44:15,148
What can I do?

991
01:44:15,350 --> 01:44:18,308
Somewhere, under those rags...

992
01:44:18,870 --> 01:44:21,942
...are you still the greatest geisha
in Miyako?

993
01:44:26,470 --> 01:44:30,907
If a tree has no leaves or branches,
can you still call it a tree?

994
01:44:31,830 --> 01:44:37,188
With nothing but rubble at my feet,
can I still call myself a businessman?

995
01:44:47,110 --> 01:44:49,305
I should have taken
better care of you.

996
01:44:49,510 --> 01:44:52,582
Please, you saved my life.

997
01:44:53,590 --> 01:44:55,785
I owe you so much in return.

998
01:44:58,870 --> 01:45:01,623
The Chairman and I
need American financing.

999
01:45:01,830 --> 01:45:04,902
There is a man,
a certain Colonel Derricks...

1000
01:45:05,110 --> 01:45:08,261
...who has the power
to grant us a contract.

1001
01:45:08,470 --> 01:45:10,904
I showed him your picture.

1002
01:45:11,830 --> 01:45:14,185
He asked to meet you.

1003
01:45:19,110 --> 01:45:22,102
I am not a persuasive man, Sayuri.

1004
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:25,029
But if you and a few geisha...

1005
01:45:25,230 --> 01:45:28,779
...would once again put on
your kimono and join us...

1006
01:45:29,190 --> 01:45:33,308
...we could show the Americans
how hospitable our country can be.

1007
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:36,024
How I wish, Nobu-san.

1008
01:45:37,990 --> 01:45:39,548
But that was a long time ago.

1009
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:41,945
I have no doubt, Sayuri...

1010
01:45:42,790 --> 01:45:46,305
...that you could still melt the heart
of any man.

1011
01:45:46,710 --> 01:45:48,985
No matter how resistant.

1012
01:45:51,910 --> 01:45:54,743
I am not accustomed to begging...

1013
01:45:56,430 --> 01:45:59,706
...but please know
that if you consent...

1014
01:46:01,270 --> 01:46:04,501
...the Chairman and I would be
most grateful.

1015
01:46:09,750 --> 01:46:10,899
One dollar. One dollar.

1016
01:46:11,110 --> 01:46:13,419
- What?
- One dollar.

1017
01:46:39,270 --> 01:46:41,386
<i>The Chairman needed me.</i>

1018
01:46:41,910 --> 01:46:45,459
<i>But I was a far cry from the geisha</i>
<i>I had once been.</i>

1019
01:46:45,670 --> 01:46:47,149
Hey, mama-san, let's step inside.

1020
01:46:47,350 --> 01:46:52,265
<i>The secrets of our hidden world were</i>
<i>postcards now for girls back home.</i>

1021
01:46:52,910 --> 01:46:56,220
<i>Any streetwalker with a painted face</i>
<i>and silk kimono...</i>

1022
01:46:56,430 --> 01:46:59,069
<i>... could call herself a geisha.</i>

1023
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:05,026
<i>I looked for the one person</i>
<i>who might help:</i>

1024
01:47:05,230 --> 01:47:06,982
<i>Mameha.</i>

1025
01:47:07,310 --> 01:47:10,188
<i>The war was written on her face.</i>

1026
01:47:10,390 --> 01:47:15,145
<i>Everything about her, not just</i>
<i>her home, was less than before.</i>

1027
01:47:16,150 --> 01:47:19,859
Sayuri, when my poor Baron
filled his pockets with stones...

1028
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:21,867
...I was desperate.

1029
01:47:22,070 --> 01:47:23,583
What could I do?

1030
01:47:23,790 --> 01:47:27,385
I sold my kimono,
I traded my jade combs for rations.

1031
01:47:29,190 --> 01:47:32,500
It was painful at first,
but I have made my peace.

1032
01:47:32,710 --> 01:47:36,749
Now, I make a small but tidy living
renting rooms.

1033
01:47:37,190 --> 01:47:39,658
I am not about to go
chasing the past.

1034
01:47:40,150 --> 01:47:41,663
It might do you good.

1035
01:47:43,270 --> 01:47:45,864
- How?
- To remind you that, once...

1036
01:47:46,070 --> 01:47:51,190
...with a single glance, you could bring
a man like the Baron to his knees.

1037
01:47:59,070 --> 01:48:00,344
Well...

1038
01:48:01,270 --> 01:48:02,749
...I did keep one kimono.

1039
01:48:13,230 --> 01:48:16,347
The Baron gave it to me
when he became my <i>danna.</i>

1040
01:48:23,310 --> 01:48:25,824
Thank you, <i>Onei-san.</i>

1041
01:48:29,830 --> 01:48:34,824
So tell me. What do we know
about entertaining Americans?

1042
01:48:50,910 --> 01:48:52,662
- Was she worth it?
- Hell, yeah.

1043
01:48:52,870 --> 01:48:55,020
- Come on.
- All right.

1044
01:49:11,430 --> 01:49:13,864
Chiyo-chan! Is that you?

1045
01:49:25,510 --> 01:49:28,946
I have no right to ask favours of you,
Pumpkin, I know that.

1046
01:49:29,150 --> 01:49:31,505
Guess what. I only smoke
Chesterfields now.

1047
01:49:31,710 --> 01:49:35,544
I have wanted to apologize to you
for so long about the <i>okiya.</i>

1048
01:49:35,750 --> 01:49:38,105
These soldiers, you know
who they've got me singing?

1049
01:49:38,310 --> 01:49:41,222
- It should have gone to you.
- Frank Sinatra and Dinah Shore.

1050
01:49:41,430 --> 01:49:43,785
If it is in your heart to forgive me...

1051
01:49:43,990 --> 01:49:46,743
Sayuri, don't.

1052
01:49:49,350 --> 01:49:50,908
The honest truth?

1053
01:49:52,470 --> 01:49:55,940
I'd rather chew sand
than go back to all that.

1054
01:49:56,630 --> 01:49:58,746
Then you are not angry with me?

1055
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:05,223
Don't worry about me, chickadee.

1056
01:50:05,430 --> 01:50:08,308
I've got more clients
than I can handle.

1057
01:50:10,070 --> 01:50:13,221
You seem so at home
with these Americans.

1058
01:50:13,830 --> 01:50:15,388
They're bastards.

1059
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:21,662
So who's this colonel?
Sounds like top brass.

1060
01:50:21,870 --> 01:50:24,907
He has the power to approve
American funding...

1061
01:50:25,110 --> 01:50:27,066
...for Nobu and the Chairman.

1062
01:50:27,670 --> 01:50:31,822
So is he willing to pay us
American dollars?

1063
01:50:32,030 --> 01:50:33,907
Cash?

1064
01:50:35,030 --> 01:50:37,544
Don't waste my time.

1065
01:50:37,750 --> 01:50:39,422
You think I'm a sucker?

1066
01:50:39,630 --> 01:50:42,190
I want 60 cases Lucky Strike...

1067
01:50:42,390 --> 01:50:45,939
...or I'm taking my business
to Sergeant MacPhee.

1068
01:50:48,310 --> 01:50:51,507
<i>I had to become a geisha</i>
<i>once more.</i>

1069
01:50:51,710 --> 01:50:56,830
<i>Mother had reopened the</i> okiya<i>,</i>
<i>but my powder box was empty.</i>

1070
01:50:57,030 --> 01:50:59,908
<i>My charcoal had turned to dust.</i>

1071
01:51:00,870 --> 01:51:05,625
<i>And yet, it was my one chance</i>
<i>to see the Chairman again.</i>

1072
01:51:06,390 --> 01:51:08,426
<i>Would he notice</i>
<i>my weathered hands</i>?

1073
01:51:08,630 --> 01:51:10,188
<i>The threadbare silk</i>?

1074
01:51:10,390 --> 01:51:13,939
See? You are yourself again.

1075
01:51:14,350 --> 01:51:19,026
<i>The world had changed completely.</i>
<i>Had he</i>?

1076
01:51:19,750 --> 01:51:24,824
<i>And would I finally find the strength</i>
<i>to tell him all that I felt</i>?

1077
01:51:47,550 --> 01:51:52,419
Just look at you, Sayuri.
It's as if the war did not happen.

1078
01:51:52,630 --> 01:51:55,224
I am so glad to see that
the Chairman is safe.

1079
01:51:55,430 --> 01:51:57,227
Accept my apologies
asking this of you...

1080
01:51:57,430 --> 01:51:58,749
No.

1081
01:51:58,950 --> 01:52:02,704
There is nothing I can do
to return your kindness.

1082
01:52:03,830 --> 01:52:06,583
- I've wanted to tell you that...
- Sayuri!

1083
01:52:10,950 --> 01:52:14,226
May I present Colonel Derricks.

1084
01:52:16,550 --> 01:52:18,745
My God, you're more stunning
in person.

1085
01:52:18,950 --> 01:52:20,986
This is my associate,
Lieutenant Hutchins.

1086
01:52:21,190 --> 01:52:22,259
It's an honour, ma'am.

1087
01:52:22,470 --> 01:52:25,985
Sayuri is one of the mysteries
of the Orient I told you about.

1088
01:52:26,190 --> 01:52:28,658
A mystery that perhaps
you can solve.

1089
01:52:29,110 --> 01:52:32,147
- Would you mind? Can we...? Colonel.
- Yes, of course. Colonel.

1090
01:52:32,350 --> 01:52:34,022
Okay, sure.

1091
01:52:36,070 --> 01:52:37,185
Good.

1092
01:52:37,390 --> 01:52:39,699
All right, hold it. Beautiful.

1093
01:52:39,910 --> 01:52:42,185
Hey, who likes whiskey?

1094
01:52:42,510 --> 01:52:44,182
Look at this. We got a live one, sir.

1095
01:52:44,390 --> 01:52:47,780
Chairman, please don't tell me
you started the party without me.

1096
01:52:47,990 --> 01:52:50,106
May I present Pumpkin.

1097
01:52:51,950 --> 01:52:54,259
- Hello!
- Pumpkin! Over here.

1098
01:52:55,390 --> 01:52:56,982
One sec.

1099
01:52:57,190 --> 01:52:59,465
Okay! Gentlemen! Please.

1100
01:52:59,670 --> 01:53:01,945
- Oh, it's been a long time.
- Good to see you.

1101
01:53:02,150 --> 01:53:05,062
You haven't changed.
You look like a little boy.

1102
01:53:07,510 --> 01:53:09,341
This is a... My!

1103
01:53:12,950 --> 01:53:15,828
It's huge! Like an elephant.

1104
01:53:19,070 --> 01:53:21,903
Please, have a seat. Buckle up.

1105
01:53:23,190 --> 01:53:24,862
I'm excited, but I'm scared.

1106
01:53:25,070 --> 01:53:27,379
You're not going anywhere! Okay?

1107
01:53:53,510 --> 01:53:55,466
Good for him, not so good for us.

1108
01:53:55,670 --> 01:53:58,423
May we join you, gentlemen?

1109
01:53:58,630 --> 01:54:00,666
- Yes, please.
- Wow, I could get used to this.

1110
01:54:00,870 --> 01:54:04,021
Back home, a bath is nothing more
than a quick shower on cold tile...

1111
01:54:04,230 --> 01:54:05,709
...with a bar of lye soap, right?

1112
01:54:05,910 --> 01:54:08,344
But here, you make everything
a ritual, don't you?

1113
01:54:08,550 --> 01:54:12,259
That is the art of turning habit
into pleasure, colonel.

1114
01:54:12,470 --> 01:54:14,188
Spoken like a true geisha.

1115
01:54:14,390 --> 01:54:18,588
If we are in business together, then
perhaps we will visit you someday.

1116
01:54:18,790 --> 01:54:20,781
I'd like to see the United States.

1117
01:54:20,990 --> 01:54:22,821
I know a little game we can play.

1118
01:54:23,030 --> 01:54:26,340
It's called Truth and Lies.

1119
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:30,182
I know this game.
Back home we call it "marriag<i>e."</i>

1120
01:54:32,470 --> 01:54:36,065
No, I'm serious. Now, listen closely.

1121
01:54:36,270 --> 01:54:39,865
- Sayuri know the rules.
- I never met a woman who didn't.

1122
01:54:40,310 --> 01:54:44,349
Each person says two things.
One is true, the other is not.

1123
01:54:44,630 --> 01:54:48,669
If you guess right,
the liar pays the price.

1124
01:54:49,270 --> 01:54:51,784
So it pays to lose.

1125
01:54:52,310 --> 01:54:53,868
There you go.

1126
01:54:54,070 --> 01:54:56,823
Okay, I'll go first. Let's see.

1127
01:54:57,270 --> 01:55:00,785
One day in Sapporo,
where I was born...

1128
01:55:01,430 --> 01:55:03,466
...a fisherman caught
a talking fish.

1129
01:55:03,670 --> 01:55:05,149
The other story is the true one.

1130
01:55:05,870 --> 01:55:08,065
And I haven't even heard it yet.

1131
01:55:08,270 --> 01:55:11,467
- How would you know?
- No, no. You drink. You drink.

1132
01:55:11,670 --> 01:55:16,186
- If I drown, it's all your fault.
- Nobu-san, your turn. Please.

1133
01:55:16,390 --> 01:55:20,349
I'm no match for these geisha.
They are experts in the art of deceit.

1134
01:55:20,550 --> 01:55:24,179
I'm an expert in one thing
and one thing only:

1135
01:55:24,390 --> 01:55:26,142
<i>Sake.</i>

1136
01:55:26,350 --> 01:55:29,228
Sayuri, the truest story you know.

1137
01:55:31,270 --> 01:55:34,580
Once, when I was a little girl...

1138
01:55:34,790 --> 01:55:37,782
...on the banks of the Sunagawa...

1139
01:55:37,990 --> 01:55:40,504
...a handsome stranger
was kind enough...

1140
01:55:40,710 --> 01:55:42,666
...to buy me a cup of sweet ice...

1141
01:55:42,870 --> 01:55:44,747
I think we have to stop the game.

1142
01:55:44,950 --> 01:55:48,101
If Pumpkin drinks any more <i>sake</i>,
she will pass out.

1143
01:55:48,310 --> 01:55:51,427
- That is a true story.
- Mameha. Sayuri. Everyone.

1144
01:55:53,350 --> 01:55:55,784
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

1145
01:55:58,030 --> 01:55:59,463
So...

1146
01:56:00,070 --> 01:56:02,425
...what is the protocol?

1147
01:56:02,950 --> 01:56:04,269
Excuse me?

1148
01:56:04,470 --> 01:56:07,064
Suppose I wanted to see you
in private.

1149
01:56:07,510 --> 01:56:11,503
I beg your pardon, colonel,
that is not a geisha's custom.

1150
01:56:12,790 --> 01:56:16,339
Don't be coy. I mean,
if it's a question of price, I'm sure...

1151
01:56:16,550 --> 01:56:20,338
If there were a price,
you could never afford it.

1152
01:56:23,910 --> 01:56:25,389
I saw the two of you whispering.

1153
01:56:25,590 --> 01:56:28,104
You have arranged some kind
of tryst, haven't you?

1154
01:56:28,310 --> 01:56:31,347
- What did you promise him?
- Your company. Nothing more.

1155
01:56:31,550 --> 01:56:33,302
He seemed to expect a great deal!

1156
01:56:33,510 --> 01:56:36,502
If I had wanted a common whore,
I could have hired one.

1157
01:56:36,710 --> 01:56:38,143
What are you trying to say?

1158
01:56:38,350 --> 01:56:42,582
Just the idea of you with him,
with any man...

1159
01:56:42,790 --> 01:56:44,428
...you'd be dead to me!

1160
01:56:55,030 --> 01:56:57,464
Can't you see that I want you
for myself?

1161
01:56:59,350 --> 01:57:00,749
You have ruined me.

1162
01:57:01,510 --> 01:57:04,866
Before we met,
I was a disciplined man.

1163
01:57:07,190 --> 01:57:09,704
I should not have asked you
to come.

1164
01:57:09,910 --> 01:57:12,026
The Chairman was against it.

1165
01:57:12,230 --> 01:57:14,585
I should have listened to him.

1166
01:57:25,270 --> 01:57:27,864
I must beg your forgiveness,
Nobu-san.

1167
01:57:28,150 --> 01:57:31,222
I was foolish to think
you would barter me away.

1168
01:57:32,230 --> 01:57:34,266
Then you made no arrangement
with the colonel?

1169
01:57:34,470 --> 01:57:36,188
Please don't insult me again.

1170
01:57:38,710 --> 01:57:41,178
If he ratifies our contract...

1171
01:57:41,830 --> 01:57:44,219
...then I will be
a man of means again.

1172
01:57:44,430 --> 01:57:47,706
There is nothing
I want more, Sayuri...

1173
01:57:48,870 --> 01:57:51,338
...than to become your <i>danna.</i>

1174
01:57:54,990 --> 01:57:56,742
I already owe you far too much.

1175
01:57:56,950 --> 01:57:58,986
- I will not be refused.
- Please.

1176
01:57:59,190 --> 01:58:02,500
We are tied to each other.
I know you feel it too.

1177
01:58:02,710 --> 01:58:05,383
I never meant to mislead you.

1178
01:58:07,750 --> 01:58:09,502
Sayuri<i>...</i>

1179
01:58:11,630 --> 01:58:15,669
I do not like things
held up before me...

1180
01:58:16,150 --> 01:58:18,300
...that I cannot have.

1181
01:58:20,550 --> 01:58:22,586
When you first introduced me
to Nobu...

1182
01:58:22,870 --> 01:58:24,906
...I was such a fool to give him
my attention.

1183
01:58:25,110 --> 01:58:27,624
- You cannot refuse him. You must not.
- But, Mameha...

1184
01:58:27,830 --> 01:58:30,867
What is he to think?
He safeguarded your life.

1185
01:58:31,070 --> 01:58:32,662
- So he owns it?
- Sayuri.

1186
01:58:33,510 --> 01:58:36,183
I know what it is like to try
and scrape by without a <i>danna.</i>

1187
01:58:36,390 --> 01:58:38,381
I will do something, anything else.

1188
01:58:38,590 --> 01:58:41,309
Renting rooms?
Scrounging for every meal?

1189
01:58:41,510 --> 01:58:43,068
Is this the life that you want?

1190
01:58:43,430 --> 01:58:45,705
I want a life that is mine!

1191
01:58:45,910 --> 01:58:49,061
Nobu has never treated you
with anything but kindness.

1192
01:58:49,270 --> 01:58:52,228
- I don't want mere kindness.
- What?

1193
01:58:52,430 --> 01:58:55,228
What more can we expect,
we geisha?

1194
01:58:56,790 --> 01:58:59,350
You had feelings for the Baron,
didn't you?

1195
01:59:01,430 --> 01:59:03,785
I never allowed myself that.

1196
01:59:04,310 --> 01:59:05,948
Don't lie to me.

1197
01:59:06,150 --> 01:59:08,186
In time, you learn.

1198
01:59:08,390 --> 01:59:11,063
- I don't want to learn!
- Sayuri!

1199
01:59:12,390 --> 01:59:15,223
We don't become geisha
to pursue our own destinies.

1200
01:59:15,430 --> 01:59:19,059
We become geisha
because we have no choice.

1201
01:59:37,030 --> 01:59:38,349
Pumpkin.

1202
01:59:38,550 --> 01:59:40,063
What is it? What's wrong?

1203
01:59:40,270 --> 01:59:43,068
Nothing. I have a favour to ask,
that's all.

1204
01:59:43,270 --> 01:59:44,464
Ask.

1205
01:59:45,110 --> 01:59:49,342
At 9:00, bring Nobu to the pool
on the far side of the garden.

1206
01:59:49,550 --> 01:59:52,348
Not a minute before,
not a minute after. Yes?

1207
01:59:54,150 --> 01:59:57,859
And, please, do not tell Nobu
that I will be there waiting.

1208
01:59:58,070 --> 02:00:00,026
It's a surprise?

1209
02:00:00,230 --> 02:00:02,903
Yes, it's a surprise.

1210
02:00:40,070 --> 02:00:41,628
Whoa, in here?

1211
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:47,185
What...? No, no, no. Hang on.
Hey, hey, hey. No, whoa.

1212
02:00:59,110 --> 02:01:01,146
I think we have done it.

1213
02:01:01,350 --> 02:01:03,910
Let's make sure he signs.

1214
02:01:12,070 --> 02:01:13,503
Wait!

1215
02:01:14,030 --> 02:01:16,021
Are we doing this or not?

1216
02:01:16,670 --> 02:01:17,944
Yes?

1217
02:01:48,550 --> 02:01:50,427
Chairman.

1218
02:01:51,110 --> 02:01:52,384
Chairman!

1219
02:02:00,230 --> 02:02:02,027
How could you?

1220
02:02:02,230 --> 02:02:04,505
You don't know
what you have done!

1221
02:02:05,350 --> 02:02:06,749
But I do.

1222
02:02:08,550 --> 02:02:10,586
I do not understand.

1223
02:02:11,190 --> 02:02:13,146
Why did you have to bring
the Chairman?

1224
02:02:14,110 --> 02:02:16,578
Because I know how you feel
about him.

1225
02:02:18,230 --> 02:02:22,906
A long time ago,
you took something from me.

1226
02:02:23,110 --> 02:02:26,420
The only thing I'd ever truly wanted.

1227
02:02:28,230 --> 02:02:29,549
Well...

1228
02:02:30,790 --> 02:02:33,668
...now you know how it feels.

1229
02:04:03,110 --> 02:04:07,149
<i>The heart dies a slow death.</i>

1230
02:04:07,750 --> 02:04:10,742
<i>Shedding each hope like leaves.</i>

1231
02:04:11,750 --> 02:04:14,708
<i>Until one day there are none.</i>

1232
02:04:15,110 --> 02:04:16,782
<i>No hopes.</i>

1233
02:04:17,510 --> 02:04:19,978
<i>Nothing remains.</i>

1234
02:04:22,310 --> 02:04:25,780
<i>She paints her face</i>
<i>to hide her face.</i>

1235
02:04:26,470 --> 02:04:28,984
<i>Her eyes are deep water.</i>

1236
02:04:30,470 --> 02:04:33,303
<i>It is not for geisha to want.</i>

1237
02:04:33,990 --> 02:04:36,823
<i>It is not for geisha to feel.</i>

1238
02:04:39,110 --> 02:04:42,898
<i>Geisha is an artist</i>
<i>of the floating world.</i>

1239
02:04:43,750 --> 02:04:45,786
<i>She dances.</i>

1240
02:04:46,230 --> 02:04:47,982
<i>She sings.</i>

1241
02:04:48,190 --> 02:04:50,579
<i>She entertains you.</i>

1242
02:04:51,110 --> 02:04:52,907
<i>Whatever you want.</i>

1243
02:04:53,670 --> 02:04:55,945
<i>The rest is shadows.</i>

1244
02:04:57,030 --> 02:04:59,703
<i>The rest is secret.</i>

1245
02:05:08,470 --> 02:05:12,463
Sayuri, quickly.
The teahouse just called.

1246
02:05:12,670 --> 02:05:16,822
You are to meet
a very important client tonight.

1247
02:05:17,030 --> 02:05:18,349
Who?

1248
02:05:18,590 --> 02:05:21,787
It must be Nobu. Yes.

1249
02:05:23,750 --> 02:05:28,505
He is going to be
one of the richest men in Osaka.

1250
02:05:29,510 --> 02:05:33,139
He wants to honour his promise:

1251
02:05:33,350 --> 02:05:36,387
To become your <i>danna</i> at last.

1252
02:05:38,710 --> 02:05:40,223
Give me.

1253
02:05:41,350 --> 02:05:43,818
It's about time.

1254
02:05:44,230 --> 02:05:48,587
Finally, a return on my investment.

1255
02:05:49,070 --> 02:05:54,269
Keiko, maybe one day
you will be as lucky.

1256
02:05:56,030 --> 02:05:58,544
No geisha can ever hope for more.

1257
02:06:00,230 --> 02:06:02,186
Let me see it.

1258
02:07:10,950 --> 02:07:12,702
Chairman.

1259
02:07:13,350 --> 02:07:15,022
Where is Nobu-san?

1260
02:07:15,230 --> 02:07:16,948
He won't be coming.

1261
02:07:17,150 --> 02:07:18,344
Is something wrong?

1262
02:07:18,550 --> 02:07:22,907
He knows what happened.
It is not in his nature to forgive.

1263
02:07:25,150 --> 02:07:28,267
Chairman, what happened
on the island...

1264
02:07:28,470 --> 02:07:30,825
Please, you do not have to explain.

1265
02:07:32,550 --> 02:07:36,828
But I have shamed myself so deeply,
past all forgiveness.

1266
02:07:37,030 --> 02:07:40,989
No. I'm the one
who must be forgiven.

1267
02:07:43,870 --> 02:07:45,428
I do not understand.

1268
02:07:47,910 --> 02:07:49,582
Perhaps...

1269
02:07:50,270 --> 02:07:52,830
...if you had only known the truth<i>...</i>

1270
02:07:54,310 --> 02:07:56,028
The truth?

1271
02:07:59,230 --> 02:08:01,027
Some years ago...

1272
02:08:01,990 --> 02:08:04,265
...I was on my way to the theatre.

1273
02:08:04,470 --> 02:08:07,348
I saw a little girl weeping
by the Sunagawa.

1274
02:08:07,870 --> 02:08:11,863
I stopped to buy her
a cup of sweet ice.

1275
02:08:12,590 --> 02:08:15,388
You knew I was that little girl?

1276
02:08:15,590 --> 02:08:18,662
Didn't you ever wonder why
Mameha took you under her wing?

1277
02:08:21,590 --> 02:08:24,627
Mameha came to me
because of you.

1278
02:08:32,390 --> 02:08:35,188
I wish you could have told me
long ago.

1279
02:08:35,390 --> 02:08:37,301
What could I do?

1280
02:08:37,510 --> 02:08:39,546
I owe Nobu my life.

1281
02:08:39,750 --> 02:08:41,547
And so...

1282
02:08:42,310 --> 02:08:47,338
...when I saw he had a chance
at happiness with you, I stood silent.

1283
02:08:47,550 --> 02:08:49,222
But<i>...</i>

1284
02:08:51,590 --> 02:08:54,104
But I cannot any longer.

1285
02:08:55,110 --> 02:08:56,782
I hope...

1286
02:08:58,550 --> 02:09:00,780
...it is not too late.

1287
02:09:04,390 --> 02:09:08,178
Don't be afraid to look at me, Chiyo.

1288
02:09:20,670 --> 02:09:22,262
Can't you see?

1289
02:09:24,630 --> 02:09:26,985
Every step I have taken...

1290
02:09:27,670 --> 02:09:30,901
...since I was that child
on the bridge...

1291
02:09:31,870 --> 02:09:35,146
...has been to bring myself
closer to you.

1292
02:10:37,950 --> 02:10:41,579
<i>You cannot say to the sun,</i>
<i>"More sun."</i>

1293
02:10:41,790 --> 02:10:44,987
<i>Or to the rain, "Less rain."</i>

1294
02:10:45,190 --> 02:10:49,627
<i>To a man, geisha can</i>
<i>only be half a wife.</i>

1295
02:10:49,830 --> 02:10:52,503
<i>We are the wives of nightfall.</i>

1296
02:10:53,310 --> 02:10:56,222
<i>And yet, to learn of kindness...</i>

1297
02:10:56,430 --> 02:10:59,467
<i>... after so much unkindness...</i>

1298
02:10:59,670 --> 02:11:04,790
<i>... to understand that a little girl</i>
<i>with more courage than she knew...</i>

1299
02:11:04,990 --> 02:11:08,266
<i>... would find her prayers</i>
<i>were answered...</i>

1300
02:11:08,830 --> 02:11:11,867
<i>... can that not be called happiness</i>?

1301
02:11:13,030 --> 02:11:14,429
<i>After all...</i>

1302
02:11:14,630 --> 02:11:20,421
<i>... these are not the memoirs</i>
<i>of an empress, nor of a queen.</i>

1303
02:11:20,750 --> 02:11:24,538
<i>These are memoirs</i>
<i>of another kind.</i>
