1
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,680
I want my fucking Zippo now.

2
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,880
Walter, that is a behavior
that will get you...

3
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,040
Fuck you!

4
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,800
Are you making a choice?

5
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,080
Hold on.

6
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,080
- Hello?
- Don't you get it yet, Waldo?

7
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,360
She's making a choice
not to give you your lighter

8
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,600
because you'll torch
the self-help library again.

9
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,400
My name's Walter.

10
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,560
Did you kill anybody recently?

11
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,560
Did you run anybody over
with your fucking car?

12
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,360
Is that them?

13
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,960
Yeah. Yes, finally.

14
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,400
You're not going to let her drive, are you?

15
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,000
Walter, you are only responsible
for yourself.

16
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,680
- This all your stuff?
- Yeah.

17
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,120
So you never gave me
your cell phone number.

18
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,680
It was a mistake. I'm lucky I didn't
get fired. We've discussed this.

19
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,360
Hey. Here you are.

20
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,680
I thought you were going to
abandon me in rehab.

21
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,480
- No.
- It's 10:30. You're half an hour late.

22
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,120
I was just standing out here
with these lunatics.

23
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,800
- Oh, my God, you look so great.
- So do you, darling.

24
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,560
- Can I take care of that? Hi, Paul Buchman.
- Rosa. We met last time you came up.

25
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,640
- Yes, hi. Good to see you again.
- Hi.

26
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,040
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

27
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,720
- All right. Sure.
- Great.

28
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,000
- Good luck to you.
- Thank you.

29
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,720
Kym. Good luck to you.

30
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,480
Thank you.

31
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,200
All right. Hey, where is everybody?

32
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,680
- Hey, Carol.
- Hello, Kym.

33
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,920
Where is everybody? Where's Rachel?

34
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,760
She's back at the house getting ready.

35
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,680
There is so much going on at the house,
I cannot tell you, dear.

36
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,240
And you know your sister's doing
everything herself.

37
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,000
My sister's bending the environment
to her will? Really?

38
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,840
There's no wedding planners
or anything like that. It's just her

39
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,600
and Sidney and a whole lot of their friends.
And she is so thrilled

40
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,400
- that you're coming home.
- Great.

41
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,800
- Now, do we have everything?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Can we just go?

42
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,720
Is there somebody that...
Anybody you need to say goodbye to?

43
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,960
God, no.

44
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,480
So are all of these energetic, young
wedding helpers staying at the house?

45
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,880
Because after nine months of constantly
revolving cell mates and crazy people and...

46
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,560
You weren't in a cell, Kym.

47
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,920
What? I was sort of looking forward to
a little privacy for once.

48
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,480
The only extra person at the house is Emma.

49
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,560
- Rachel and Emma.
- Yes.

50
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,440
Good God, how relaxing.

51
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,720
The only two people on the planet
less capable of delegating than Hannibal.

52
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,280
- On the eve of a wedding. Nachtmahr.
- Nachtmahr?

53
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,320
Nachtmahr. You don't know Nachtmahr?

54
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,000
Nachtmahrwas a nightmare so bad
it's in German.

55
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,080
I see.

56
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,960
Rachel must be, like, totally freaking out.
Is she too tense?

57
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,400
Are all of her latent food issues
rearing their heads?

58
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,280
Is she still hoarding Snickers
and Cool Whip under the bed

59
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,440
like when she was in high school?
She never did put that one to rest.

60
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,320
I don't think that's a problem
for her, darling.

61
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,520
No offense, Dad, but you never thought
that was a problem for her.

62
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,880
So I'm really looking forward
to seeing Mom.

63
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,320
You'll see your mom tonight and Andrew
at the rehearsal dinner.

64
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,320
Well, maybe I'll head over there,
to her house, after I see Rachel.

65
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,440
Well, I don't know.

66
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,560
Can we pull over, please?

67
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,760
I'm sorry, I feel nauseous,
and I need something to drink.

68
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,040
- I have a Diet Coke for you.
- I prefer Pepsi from the fountain.

69
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,800
Hey, didn't I see you on Cops?

70
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,680
- Olive.
- Hey, there's Olive.

71
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,960
Rented chairs, tribes of people.

72
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,720
Yep.

73
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,920
- Hey, Dad, don't worry about it.
I'll get it. - Got it.

74
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,320
Hi, gentlemen.

75
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,640
Hello.

76
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,360
Anyway, I'm sorry. I just saw a ghost.

77
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,840
- Is this too short?
- Oh, my God! You are just minute!

78
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,160
Kymmie!

79
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,280
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
I have pins all over me.

80
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,600
- Yeah, I can feel.
- Kym, could you not smoke in here, please?

81
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
- You look great.
- Oh, no, I'm so fat.

82
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,440
Well, rehab makes you fat.
It's all the vending machines.

83
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,320
- No, stop it.
- No, you!

84
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,000
I would swear to God
that you were puking again.

85
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,440
- Hi, Kym.
- Hi, Emma.

86
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,120
Seriously, you're so tiny,
it's like you're Asian.

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,520
So what's the deal?
Are you an actual shrink yet?

88
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,960
Even though you're like 12 years old.

89
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,640
Rachel's taking psychology, not psychiatry.

90
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,160
You know the difference, right?

91
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,360
You should prescribe something soothing
for Emma, like Vicodin.

92
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,440
I will have my PhD in a year and a half,

93
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,000
and psychologists don't get
prescription pads.

94
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,280
I think they do in Guam, actually.

95
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,640
Could you please put that out?
Emma designed this dress,

96
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,520
and there's, like, 47 yards of fabric,
and it's going to go up like the Hindenburg.

97
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,920
- Okay, okay. I'm sorry. It's going out.
- Thank you, Kym.

98
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,920
Angela Paylin is coming to the wedding.

99
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,280
Angela Paylin is not coming.

100
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,440
- Really?
- Yeah.

101
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,920
Oh, my God!

102
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,040
I ate so much cookie dough and did
so many whippits with Angela Paylin.

103
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
I know.

104
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,040
And she confessed to you
her secret Elvis Stojko fantasy.

105
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,160
- How did you...
- What?

106
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,560
- I spied on you.
- Elvis Stojko, the figure skater?

107
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,280
Oh, my God!

108
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,560
She had this fantasy where
she was wearing her hair up,

109
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,960
- and these very serious...
- Very, very

110
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,960
...professional glasses because...
... very serious.

111
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,080
She was an Olympic judge.
A world-renowned judge. At the men's...

112
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,960
- Skating final in the winter Olympics.
- In the winter Olympics.

113
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,160
- And Elvis Stojko was skating...
- For the gold.

114
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,800
In the finals to Could This Be Magic.

115
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,520
By Barry. By Barry!

116
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,880
And just when Barry gets to...

117
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,800
- Now, now, now, and hold on fast!
- Now, now, and hold on fast!

118
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,840
He skates over to the table
and he stops in front of her.

119
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,360
Their eyes lock and he reaches for her hand.

120
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,280
- And she takes it.
- Takes it.

121
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,120
- Undoes her hair!
- Oh, my God.

122
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,160
And they skate as a pair
to the rest of the song.

123
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,160
- And he gets disqualified.
- But he doesn't care!

124
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,920
- But he doesn't care.
- Right. Oh, my God!

125
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,800
I'm going to go downstairs and find Olive
and get some unconditional love.

126
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,360
You look great.

127
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,120
- Welcome home.
- Thank you. Emma.

128
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,440
Speaking of dogs, when am I going to
meet this fiancé of yours, anyhow?

129
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,320
He went to pick up some stuff with Kieran.
He'll be back.

130
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,120
I'm making hot dogs and hungabungas.
Who wants what?

131
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,920
- It's too hot.
- I don't eat gluten, Paul.

132
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,760
- Two...
- May I have one, too?

133
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,840
Yeah. You don't eat what, dear?

134
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,280
Gluten.

135
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,400
- Where's Kym?
- Besides, I'm in my dress.

136
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,000
You're in your dress? Let me see it.

137
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,480
- No!
- No!

138
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,360
- All right. Okay.
- Come on, Olive.

139
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,040
- What can I get for you, Kymmie?
- Actually, I'm late for a meeting.

140
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,000
And I have to pee into a cup
and register as a general biohazard.

141
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,600
Okay, I'll drive you, honey.

142
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,360
No, that's okay.
Just tell me which car I should use.

143
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,560
Well, honey...

144
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,920
- Can I get a hungabunga, Paul?
- One hungabunga.

145
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,600
- Can I get one, too?
- Two hungabungas.

146
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,880
Which car?

147
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,440
- Kymmie, do me a favor now.
- Excuse me.

148
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,000
- I have my license.
- I know, dear.

149
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,800
You just wouldn't believe my insurance
right now, and I'm not that comfortable.

150
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,800
Can we figure something else out?

151
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,240
Hi. Hi, I'm here to pee into a cup.

152
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,280
She's here to pee into a cup.
Someone will be right with you.

153
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,840
Okay. There's a meeting I have to get to.

154
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,720
- The meetings are over in the other
building. - I know that.

155
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,120
Someone will be right with you. Have a seat.

156
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,640
I'm an addict.

157
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,920
Cocksucker!

158
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,160
- Only once.
- Sorry.

159
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,000
Only once, my dealer.

160
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,880
- I was very hard up for cash.
- I'm okay.

161
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,360
- Thank you. Excuse me.
- Anyway, I'm in from Hawaii.

162
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,280
This is my first time at this meeting.
Thank you.

163
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,120
- Welcome.
- Go right ahead.

164
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,960
- I'm Steve. I'm an addict.
- Hi, Steve.

165
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,840
- Hi, Steve.
- Hey. This is my...

166
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,560
My first meeting, actually,
so I'm a little bit...

167
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,880
Hey. Thanks for coming, Steve.

168
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,160
"One. We admitted that we are powerless
over our addiction,

169
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,880
"that our lives had become unmanageable.

170
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,240
"Two. We came to believe that
a power greater than ourselves... "

171
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
And whatever happened to me,
it took me away.

172
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,240
It just gave me hope for one more day.

173
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,480
And that's how I live, one day at a time.

174
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,840
You see, yesterday is gone
and tomorrow is not here.

175
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,680
The only thing I can do is what I can do
today to make tomorrow different.

176
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,480
There was a point, man,
where I thought I could do one more,

177
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,000
take another drink.
But it always end up the same.

178
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,920
You know, one was too many
and a thousand was never enough.

179
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,520
I got tired of starting from
square one again, man.

180
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,120
You know everything that I built up with
my family, everything that I built up...

181
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,640
You know, and people helping me
and providing for me...

182
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,120
You know, you relapse,
you got to start all over again.

183
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,680
And, man, I got tired of
starting over again.

184
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,240
You know, it was dramatic.
You know, there's a lot of, you know...

185
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,280
It's ups and downs
and it's crazy, and then...

186
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,040
And just recently,
there's something, you know...

187
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,120
I can feel myself almost, like,
missing the drama sometimes. Like, I'm...

188
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,280
It gets so boring sometimes.

189
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,080
You know I used to say I'm not an addict.
And it took me years to say I was an addict.

190
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,080
Then I spent years, like...
That's all I was.

191
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,560
You know? I was just an addict.

192
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,360
If you could just, kind of, accept it as
a fact, just one fact among many.

193
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,640
- That I can be that and other things.
- That's right.

194
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,480
Things that are going to build you up
in the journey that you're on.

195
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,120
All of us have felt that way at some time.

196
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,280
But I want to encourage you.
You're doing well.

197
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,240
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

198
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,720
the courage to change the things I can
and the wisdom to know the difference.

199
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,000
And it says keep coming back,
'cause it works, if you work it.

200
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,800
Well, thanks a lot. I'll see you next time.

201
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,800
Kymmie! Carol, she's here.

202
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,880
Kymmie! I got a sandwich for you, darling.
It's meat loaf.

203
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,600
- Hi, dear.
- Hey.

204
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,240
- Quite a ride, huh?
- Yep.

205
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,560
- Meat loaf.
- Look at that.

206
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,760
- Yeah.
- Yummy.

207
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,200
- Okay.
- Wow. Thank you.

208
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,400
- You're welcome.
- That's big.

209
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,720
I'm so glad you're here, darling.
I'm so glad you're back.

210
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,360
- Did you think I wasn't coming back?
- No.

211
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,160
- I'll take Bill's bike.
- Kymberly!

212
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,080
- Hey!
- Come meet Sidney.

213
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,360
- This is my betrothed, Sidney Williams.
- Hi.

214
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,960
- Hello.
- Hi.

215
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,280
And this is best man, Kieran.

216
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,440
- Hey.
- Hi, there.

217
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,680
- How are you?
- Good.

218
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,520
- How's your knee?
- Shut up.

219
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,280
You want meat loaf? My dad made meat loaf.

220
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,720
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

221
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,520
I think that we have started
a new tradition.

222
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,720
- That's what I think, yeah.
- Yeah. What's that?

223
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,440
I think it's the best man
and the maid of honor

224
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,360
sneaking off to get it on,

225
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,760
while the rest of the wedding party?
Very happily

226
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,360
and furiously plans for the big event.

227
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,960
But I thought...
I thought that was Emma's role.

228
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,400
What?

229
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,800
The maid of honor.

230
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,160
I mean, I heard that that was the plan.

231
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,480
I'm sure it is.

232
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,520
- I might be wrong.
- No.

233
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,400
Do you love it?

234
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,240
I mean, the lilac's fabulous, Emma.
She looks like a freesia.

235
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,040
Isn't it beautiful?
We should just cover your tattoo.

236
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,560
What?

237
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,280
Nothing, nothing.
I just really like the gray.

238
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,400
Of course you do.

239
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,920
We're all wearing lilac.
It's coordinated. It's a wedding.

240
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,320
Okay, well, this is in the color scheme,
and it looks like a cloud.

241
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,720
- It's fantastic.
- Exactly.

242
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,920
- You know how I am. I don't wear lilac.
- It's good to have a principle.

243
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,720
What? You wore a lilac sweater
with a cat face on the front of it

244
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,000
on the cover of Seventeen magazine...

245
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,280
- That was so cute!
... when I was at fat camp.

246
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,120
Yeah, they paid me,
and I was on horse tranquillizer, so...

247
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,640
You look good. Seriously.

248
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,840
Why is Emma the maid of honor?
Why am I not the maid of honor?

249
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,040
Because.

250
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,200
What does that mean?

251
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,520
Because I wasn't entirely sure when
you were coming or if you'd even make it.

252
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,640
What? I wasn't sure
if you'd have time for a fitting...

253
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,760
Bullshit. It's a sari.

254
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,440
You take a bolt of cloth and you wrap it
around yourself a bunch of times.

255
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,960
Jesus Christ, I've been home for a day.

256
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,080
I can't get a straight answer
out of anybody.

257
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
What are you talking about?

258
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,880
I'm talking about Dad offering me food
every two seconds.

259
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,040
You know, Dad offers
Irish hunger strikers food.

260
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,840
No. You know, it's not even about the food.
He has to know exactly where I am

261
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,080
at all times because he's never
resolved his own trust issues.

262
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
- That's odd.
- You know what? Shut the fuck up!

263
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,680
- Blow me!
- Okay.

264
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,760
- Leave Dad alone.
- I'd love to. I want to, okay?

265
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,280
He won't let me. I just...

266
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,360
I can feel him watching me all the time.
And Carol, and you guys, too.

267
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,280
Because we have nothing better
to think about.

268
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,080
You know, everyone in the house is
looking at me like I'm a visiting sociopath.

269
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,600
I mean, seriously, what do you expect
me to do, burn the house down?

270
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,640
That was a mattress fire. That was
not even at home. It was at a sleepover.

271
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,640
Okay, you know what? Fine.
Fuck you both. You win.

272
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,800
I'm going to get "hazmat" tattooed
across my forehead for you people.

273
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,160
- Will that make you happy?
- God, you're like a harpy!

274
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,680
Okay, is being my maid of honor
that important to you?

275
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,320
Because I didn't think you gave a shit.
I'm sorry.

276
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,120
How could you fucking say that to me?

277
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,480
Jesus. Emma.

278
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,680
Emma, would you be horribly offended
and hurt

279
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,000
if I asked you step down as maid of honor?

280
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,960
For her? What?

281
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,880
Rachel, are you serious?
Is this what you want?

282
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,480
- Okay, fine. Fine.
- Not really.

283
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:07,680
You can have it. The crown is yours.
First runner-up.

284
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,760
Thank you, Emma, thank you.

285
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,440
- You know what?
- Everything is not about you, Kym.

286
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,560
No, it's not about me.
It's about sisterhood.

287
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,440
You're such a paragon of sisterhood.
Hooray for sisterhood!

288
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,880
You know what? Sisterhood conquers all.

289
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,680
You know, I can really see rehab
has done wonders for you, Kym.

290
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,760
Fuck you.

291
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,800
Cousin Joe, on leave, from Iraq.
I almost forgot him!

292
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,320
Come on and say...

293
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,400
- Rachel, Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
- Rachel, Rachel, Rachel, Rachel

294
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,160
- Sidney, Sidney, Sidney, Sidney
- Sidney, Sidney, Sidney, Sidney

295
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,760
- Rachel, Rachel
- Sidney, Sidney

296
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,920
- Rachel
- Sidney

297
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,560
You know I tapped her on the shoulder.
I was like,

298
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,920
"How you doing? My name's Dorian.
I'd, you know, like to talk to you. "

299
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,080
And she was like, "Good to meet you.
Excuse me. Can you move over?

300
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,080
"There's a beautiful guy
standing right behind you. "

301
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,960
And it was Sid.

302
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,240
Dorian!

303
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:32,000
We've gotjoy like a fountain

304
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:38,480
We've gotjoy in our soul

305
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,560
Thank you guys for bringing us here.

306
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,400
Such a wonderful occasion to be here
and be back amongst family and friends.

307
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,240
You know, Paul, you've been such
a great friend of mine over the years.

308
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,960
It seems like yesterday when I met you.

309
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,200
And we were at your house playing music
and discussing music.

310
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,840
Watching everyone grow up. Rachel. Kym.

311
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,200
And now Rachel's getting married.
Rachel getting married.

312
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,000
Yeah.

313
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:21,040
But we also need to
honor my little friend Ethan

314
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,280
who's gone on to another plane now,
you know.

315
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,920
But his spirit is here
and he lives in our heart

316
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,200
and pays no rent every day.
And he's watching over us.

317
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,680
Charlie Parker said,
"The music speaks louder than words. "

318
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,600
So I'm going to play a piece for you
that I've written for this occasion.

319
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,560
It's called Rachel loves Sidney.

320
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,400
That's the A-side.
The B-side is Sidney loves Rachel.

321
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,040
Excuse me for a second.

322
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,360
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

323
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,760
I don't know anyone at what is
obviously the loser end of the table.

324
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,160
Can I get to the masala?

325
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,400
You've known most of those people
since the eighth grade.

326
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
- I don't think so.
- You always pretend you don't know people.

327
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,600
- Watch my dress.
- Is it 'cause you owe them money?

328
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,800
I'm sorry, family members only
in this discussion.

329
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,920
Speaking of which, where is Mom?
Where's our mother?

330
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,160
How can she not be here?
I haven't seen her since I've been home.

331
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,360
She called a couple of times
and she said she's running late,

332
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,280
- but she should be here soon.
- God.

333
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,200
Kieran, do you want
any of this saag paneer?

334
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,440
No, thanks. Is there any krill?

335
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,880
- I'm kidding. Sorry, it's a joke.
- It just went over my head.

336
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,360
I can't believe Mom would be late
for my release back into the wild.

337
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,120
And here I was thinking tonight
was about Rachel.

338
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,880
Rach, I forgot to tell you.
Carol got the helium tanks.

339
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,680
The words Carol and helium somehowjust...

340
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,840
Hey, aren't there some rules
about helium tanks?

341
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,320
She would not have any idea
what to do with a helium tank.

342
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,400
I think that's only on public property?
Though, helium tanks.

343
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,280
- Yeah, it's a huge liability.
- Helium tanks?

344
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,280
- You're a lawyer?
- Was, for five minutes.

345
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,000
Say something legal.

346
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,560
Tort.

347
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,280
What do you do now?

348
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,800
Now I just help Sidney out
with the business side of his stuff.

349
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,200
Sweet.

350
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,600
- Do you want me to call her?
- No, no.

351
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,520
- There she is.
- Oh, my God! Mom!

352
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,760
- Mom!
- Darling, hi.

353
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,040
- Kym! Come here, honey.
- Thank you.

354
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,880
Did you get my note?

355
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,040
Yeah.

356
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,440
Let me look at you. You're beautiful.

357
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,080
- No, I'm fat. Rehab makes you fat.
- No, nonsense. You girls.

358
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,840
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.

359
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,040
Mom, where have you been?

360
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,200
- Everything's fine.
- Did you get the dates confused?

361
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,400
No, no, everything's fine, honey.

362
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,400
- Introduce me around.
- This is Sidney's family.

363
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,440
This is Carol-Jean. This is my mom, Abby.

364
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,120
- Congratulations.
- And this is her husband, Andrew.

365
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,520
- Andrew.
- John, Abby, my mom.

366
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,240
- Pleasure.
- Don't you steal her.

367
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,880
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you. Congratulations.

368
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,440
- Thank you.
- And this is Grandma.

369
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,480
- Hello.
- Emma!

370
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:43,200
Mom, you look so great.
Really, you look amazing.

371
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,360
Honey, don't smoke. I don't think it's...
Can you smoke here?

372
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,440
- Yeah, yeah, totally. It's a private party?
- This is the best man, Kieran.

373
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,120
- Nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you. I'm Kieran.

374
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,640
How's Grandma?
Is she still surly and irascible?

375
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,640
She's great. You know Grandma.
She sends her love.

376
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,200
- Great, same.
- You want to sit?

377
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,240
Go put the cigarette out,
'cause I don't think it's fine.

378
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,720
- Sit.
- Just put it out.

379
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,840
- Just put it out.
- Okay. It's going out.

380
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,840
The father of the bride and the father of
the groom are not supposed to do anything

381
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:17,320
but grin like jack -o' -lanterns
and write checks,

382
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,320
and I think that's what we've been doing,
John, you and I, yeah? Right?

383
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:27,080
Williams' family. Carol-Jean and John.
Beautiful sister Kyrah.

384
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,760
And of course, Grand Mama Herreast.

385
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,600
And Specialist Joseph Gonzales.

386
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,040
As the good doctor said to start us off
with the meal,

387
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,320
we're glad that you're out of harm's way,

388
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,680
and we want you home for good.

389
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,760
Happy to be home. Thank you.

390
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,360
Williams' family, welcome to Connecticut
and its complicated tax structure.

391
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,200
We just met.

392
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,800
I just want you to know
how blessed we are to be

393
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,920
joining forces with you, and we've just met,
but I'm going to tell you, we love you.

394
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:15,440
Well, I have known Sidney for...

395
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,880
What is it? Fifteen, 20, 20...
Most of my life, most of my life.

396
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,600
He's been a great friend.

397
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,800
He's been with me through thick and thin.

398
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,920
And

399
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,880
I'll tell you,
sometimes it's gotten very, very thin.

400
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,320
But he stood by me through all of it and...

401
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,040
My friend, it is a pleasure and an honor

402
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,120
to be able to stand by you
on this profound occasion.

403
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,640
I love you, and you couldn't have done
any better here.

404
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,920
Cheers.

405
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:04,080
We are gathered here to celebrate love
pure and simple.

406
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,640
Rachel is pure. Sidney is simple.

407
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,960
May the two of you live and love
for as long as you want,

408
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:20,280
but never want for as long as you live.
And most importantly,

409
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:25,280
may all of your ups and downs
come only in the bedroom.

410
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,920
- You're paying for that, Emma.
- I can't believe I just did that.

411
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,400
- Be careful, be careful.
- Don't cut yourself.

412
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,560
I want to make a toast to the happy couple

413
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,680
'cause I want to come visit you in Hawaii.

414
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,760
And, Sidney, what's the name
of that place again?

415
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,160
It's Hunuku-ook, Hunookook...

416
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,520
Yeah, what they said.

417
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:57,160
So I've known the bride her entire life.
Not biblically speaking.

418
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,000
Except for that time we French-kissed
at Evan Yasky's party? In ninth grade.

419
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,240
Stop!

420
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,160
- Film. I want film.
- It was a dare, you know.

421
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,600
So commence embarrassing story.

422
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,960
Wait, that wasn't it?

423
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,200
So do you remember when I was teaching
you how to drive in the Wagoneer,

424
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:22,480
and you sideswiped that taxi
and knocked off his side mirror?

425
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,760
No, I have no recollection
of that whatsoever.

426
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:32,040
Well, well, well, I would like to share
with everyone that Miss Rachel,

427
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,720
before she had her license
or knew anything about how to drive,

428
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,640
managed to out-maneuver an irate,
screaming cab driver

429
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,160
all the way across 96th Street
to the East River,

430
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,280
handily avoiding two EMT guys
loading an old lady

431
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,360
onto a gurney or something.

432
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,080
And then she got the number of one of
the EMT guys and went out with him twice.

433
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,440
Yeah, that I did do. Three. Three times.

434
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,200
Hey, Rach,
was that the guy with the peroxide hair?

435
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,320
So, anyway, when the cab driver
finally caught up with us,

436
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:10,800
she talked him down from
his Middle-Eastern fury in like...

437
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,200
Mahamoud! Such a nice man!

438
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,680
In like, you know, pretend Arabic,
Farsi, Urdu, I don't know.

439
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,680
And then she uses his radio thing
to call his dispatcher

440
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,120
and recommend him for a commendation
because she's so sweet.

441
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,720
So here's to a woman who can

442
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,560
drive fast, pick up a paramedic,
make up foreign languages

443
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:42,160
and still get you home in one piece.
And, Sidney, you're a lucky bastard.

444
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,400
Hear, hear.

445
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,720
I prayed for you, Rachel. I prayed for you.

446
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:57,520
I knew you'd come, and here you are,
and we are one, all of us.

447
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,680
And this is how it is in Heaven.
Just like this.

448
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,960
Amen.

449
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,280
And I'm so glad we're having
a rehearsal on it now.

450
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,840
Yes, it's the little princess.

451
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,960
Here's to you, Sid. I love you to pieces.
You're the best brother anybody can ask for.

452
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,520
I want to give thanks.

453
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,320
I've known Rachel since kindergarten,
not quite her entire life, Emma, but...

454
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,080
So you win. But...

455
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:42,040
I just... I'm so grateful

456
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,840
to be your bridesmaid
and be a part of this moment and...

457
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,680
Don't look at me like that.

458
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,560
Hello. Hello.

459
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,160
Hello.

460
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,840
Relax, it's seltzer.

461
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,160
Hello.

462
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,160
I'm Shiva the destroyer and your harbinger
of doom for this evening.

463
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,000
I would like to thank you all
for coming and welcome you.

464
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,240
Even though I haven't seen most of you
since my latest stretch in the big house.

465
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,120
But you all look fabulous.

466
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,080
So during the 20 minutes or so
that I was not in the hole for

467
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,160
making a shiv out of my toothbrush,
I actually did participate

468
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,480
in the infamous 12-step program.

469
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,280
Twelve steps.
Step-ball-change. Step-ball-change.

470
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,440
Still waiting for the change part.

471
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,840
So... But, you know, as they say,

472
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,920
the relapse is an almost inevitable part
of recovery.

473
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,640
So I get high marks in that mode.

474
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,920
Anywho.

475
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:01,320
I... Well, as more of you know
than are likely to admit,

476
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,480
one of the steps, actual steps,

477
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,360
is about making amends.

478
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,200
So, I did a lot of apologizing to people.

479
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,440
Some of whom barely remembered me,
most of whom barely remembered anything.

480
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,320
And I apologized for,

481
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,920
you know, like, bouncing a check,

482
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,120
or passing out in their bathtub
or flooding their

483
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:40,640
house and, you know,
just basically for involving them in

484
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,040
sordid activities that they were
desperately trying to forget. I

485
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:50,600
had to call this one girl who was,
I think, 14,

486
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,800
but she couldn't come to the phone
actually because

487
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,520
her mom had taken out
a restraining order, but...

488
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,360
But anyway... So I spent a lot of time...
The point is, I spent a lot of time

489
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,920
apologizing to people who were
pretty much perfect strangers.

490
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,240
So, I would very much
like to take this opportunity

491
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:16,800
to not only congratulate
my extraordinary sister,

492
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,520
the future explorer in matters of the mind,
thank you very much,

493
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,400
and her adorable, impending husband

494
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,160
on the occasion
of their unprecedented nuptials,

495
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:31,560
but also, to apologize
to said extraordinary sister,

496
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,240
future explorer in matters of the mind, for

497
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,120
what? I don't know. Everything.

498
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,760
And I really mean that, Rach. You've...

499
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,640
I've been a nightmare, you've been a saint,

500
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:54,600
and I'm reallyjust so damn glad
to be here with you

501
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,120
and Sidney's family
and our family and just...

502
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,640
Everyone's together and I'm just...

503
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,920
It's really great. So I am hereby

504
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,920
raising my seltzer to my laudatory sister

505
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,480
and herewith making amends.

506
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,880
Sidney, you are robbing
our dysfunctional family

507
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,760
of one of its most vital ingredients,

508
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,720
and its only member still willing to
lend me money.

509
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,800
- So, boo on you.
- That's not true.

510
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,000
Anyway, enjoy Hawaii.

511
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,560
- L'chaim.
- L'chaim.

512
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,120
One, two, one, two.

513
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,520
Yo, Sidney, who I met
hanging out in Kingston, Jamaica,

514
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:46,600
while we were at House of Leo,
and Stone Love was playing that night.

515
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,240
Those big speakers pounding,
all that Jamaican dub was pumping,

516
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,960
clouds of those medicinal herbs
were floating.

517
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,720
Man. Was a lot of fun, my man.

518
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,040
It was great meeting you, hanging out
with you, becoming friends with you,

519
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,680
seeing all the amazing things
that you're doing musically.

520
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,720
All I want to say to you guys is,
may you both live to be 100.

521
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,960
And me, 100, but minus a day,

522
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,880
so I'll never know beautiful people
like you have passed away.

523
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,960
Do your thing, baby.

524
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,280
I felt that. I felt that.
You drank it and I felt it.

525
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,360
I know.

526
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,040
Sidney has always nurtured me
and supported me

527
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,640
no matter what he's been through.

528
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,360
How much do you owe him?
How much money do you owe him?

529
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,680
In lira, it's billions.

530
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,640
Everyone's saying so much love
and beautiful words

531
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,320
and amazing stuff, and...

532
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,520
- This is not an award.
- I know, I'm not even using it.

533
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,640
You're like accepting an award here.

534
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,360
That's what it's about, you know,
there's nothing more.

535
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,160
Everything else, just destroy it.
Just destroy it.

536
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,560
Because without love... You know?

537
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,560
Hello, Olive.
I know it. It's in my head.

538
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,480
Oh, God, I am exhausted.

539
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,720
- Is there any watermelon?
- Let me see.

540
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,120
- Nice apology.
- What?

541
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,360
Nice apology.

542
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,720
I was toasting you
and I was making amends.

543
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,800
It's one of the steps. It's important.

544
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,280
I know what the steps are.
I learned them in school,

545
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,840
and I visited you in various
facilities, Kym.

546
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,440
Oh, God.

547
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,680
Dad? What?

548
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,680
"Amends. Noun, usually followed by 'for,'
off-set a disability

549
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,000
"or frustration by development
in another direction. "

550
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,880
- Yes.
- But you've never said anything to me

551
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,520
that's remotely apologetic,

552
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,400
yet all of sudden at my wedding dinner
in front of everybody,

553
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,720
you decide to grace us all
with your development.

554
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,360
I just got home.

555
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,520
"Gee. Hey, everybody and guests,

556
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,320
"just in case you might be thinking
about something else for five minutes,

557
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,920
"like, I don't know, my sister's wedding,
they just cut me loose.

558
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,480
"I'm a loose cannon!
Anybody up for some rehab humor?

559
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,800
"Because I'm really, really fine
with acknowledging my disease.

560
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,360
"Hey, and now watch me be really selfless
and weave a lovely blanket apology

561
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,080
"to my sister for being
just a tad out of her loop. "

562
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,080
- You are so cynical.
- Rachel, enough.

563
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,400
Rachel, she is making an effort here.

564
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,920
An effort, is that what that was?
Because I think she presumes

565
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,960
that since everything has always
revolved around her disease,

566
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,680
that everything else is going to revolve
around her recovery. That's what I think.

567
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,680
- Rachel, she just got home.
- Again.

568
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,600
- I had no idea you were so angry, Doctor.
- I'm not.

569
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,120
Oh, my God.

570
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,280
Kymmie, your sister has got
a lot on her plate right now.

571
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,000
- She is uptight about...
- I'm not uptight, Dad!

572
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,920
She's meeting Sidney's folks
for the first time, menus,

573
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
there's all this live music, you're home.
There's...

574
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,280
It's just that there are
a thousand things to worry about.

575
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,320
Absolutely. A wedding will take everything
out of you. I'll tell you that.

576
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,440
Yeah, and that's why it would be so lovely
if we could all...

577
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,840
You know, you people really need to purge.

578
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,560
You really should go to a Nar-Anon
or something. It's...

579
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,880
Now, Kym, come on, baby. Oh, my Lord.
We've been to Nar-Anon. You know that.

580
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,520
Wait, wait a second. You people? You mean,
your family? The people in this room?

581
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,040
Yes. All of you people living in
this little world ofjudgment

582
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:12,400
and paranoia and mistrust.
I can feel it all the time. It's like...

583
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,880
At the slightest sign of ingratitude or

584
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,480
absence of atonement, it's like
the fucking Salem witch trials around here.

585
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,280
- I should just use again. I should.
- Don't even start that.

586
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,800
- Don't even start.
- Wait, wait, wait.

587
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,880
Kym. Kym, look at me.

588
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,720
Nobody can make you feel any kind of
way unless you let them. Period. The end.

589
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,680
Thank you, Carol,

590
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,320
but you people are my family.

591
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,320
I mean, you make me feel like shit
a hundred times a day.

592
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,560
You know what, Rach? You try living under
Dad's constant monitoring for five minutes,

593
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,000
- tell me how you like it.
- What constant monitoring?

594
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,960
- Kym?
- Oh, my God! Are you serious?

595
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,840
"Carol, Carol, where is she?"

596
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,640
"Don't sleep here, sleep here.
Eat this. You know, I'll drive you. "

597
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,120
Dad, really, honestly,
you're kind of obsessed.

598
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,640
Oh, my God. That's hardly news.

599
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,240
I mean, you may not know this, Kym.
No, sure you do.

600
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,120
I mean, the only way to engage Dad
in any meaningful communication

601
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,640
is to start the conversation with your name.

602
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,120
"Have you heard from Kym? How's Kym?"
It resuscitates him.

603
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,800
It jars him into the moment, like an alarm.

604
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,040
- Rachel, that is not true. It is totally
unfair. - What? She's even worse, Dad!

605
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,200
"Dad, you're never going to believe this,
but that check you sent me

606
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,120
"never showed up,
and my landlord hates me. "

607
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,640
"Dad, can somebody meet me downstairs
with cab fare?

608
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,000
"And you're never going to believe this

609
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,160
"but I lost my wallet
and my checkbook got stolen.

610
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,080
"I got to go to the emergency room,
and everybody hates me. "

611
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,720
You know what, Rachel?
It really sounds like you have

612
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,080
some serious paternal/sibling
issues to work through.

613
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,560
Please! Are you kidding?

614
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,440
The two of you are like
a double helix of crises.

615
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,560
- Oh, shut up, shut up.
- I mean, in the language of psychology,

616
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,120
one could say
you both suffer from acute boundary issues.

617
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,440
Rachel! It is very nice that you're
getting your PhD.

618
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,680
- Oh, God!
- Don't be patronizing!

619
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,800
I'm sorry, but it's not...

620
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,560
It's ugly, honey. It's not becoming to you.

621
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,440
Well, how come she gets to spout off about
paternal/sibling issues,

622
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,200
but God forbid I should even reference
the boundary thing,

623
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,040
even though I actually know
what I'm talking about.

624
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:01,040
By the way, I'm not in crisis.
I haven't been in crisis in a year.

625
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,920
- You just got out of rehab!
- Oh, my God!

626
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,360
Why is this so difficult
for you to understand?

627
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,360
Rehabilitation, crisis.
You should really learn the difference.

628
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,360
No, it's like you're not happy unless
I'm in some kind of a desperate situation.

629
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,120
You have no idea what to do with me
unless I'm in crisis.

630
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,840
Why am I the only one
willing to say this shit?

631
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,640
You are so much more
evolved in your suffering.

632
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,160
I'm not... Who is talking about that?

633
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,000
Your suffering is not the most
important thing to everybody.

634
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,280
- Who is saying it is?
- I have a life. I'm in school.

635
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,640
- I'm getting married. I'm...
- What?

636
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,320
- I'm pregnant.
- You're pregnant? You're pregnant now?

637
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,160
- Are you serious?
- Oh, my God!

638
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,760
- What?
- Oh, my God!

639
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,680
That is so unfair!

640
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,560
So unfair!

641
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,240
When did you find out about this?

642
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,560
Roughly about the day before
we decided to get married.

643
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,760
I can barely believe this myself!

644
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,840
How far? How along? You know?

645
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,320
I mean, how pregnant are you?
Did you tell your mother?

646
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,400
- Yeah. We told her at dinner.
- Good. Okay, good.

647
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,360
- She was so happy.
- Dad, stop. Can you just stop?

648
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,480
Please. Seriously. Fuck me!

649
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,920
Rachel, I'm sorry, Dad, but you can't drop
a tectonic bit of information

650
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,040
into a completely separate conversation,
Rachel. You can't do that.

651
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,880
- Kym, you're going to have a niece.
- Or nephew.

652
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,560
I know. Oh, God. Yeah, I'm excited for you.
But you can't

653
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,960
tell me when we're talking like this, Rach.
It's a total set-up. It's not fair.

654
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,960
Yeah.

655
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,880
God. I am so fucking exhausted.

656
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,400
Oh, God.
Dad, will you tell her I'm happy for her?

657
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,280
She won't talk to me.

658
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:00,000
I'm really tired.
I think I'm going to head up to bed. Sidney?

659
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,600
- Yeah. That's a great idea.
- You're leaving now,

660
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,200
- in the middle of this conversation?
- Yes.

661
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,880
Kymmie, she's pregnant
and she's exhausted, baby.

662
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,920
Okay. Okay, fine. Fair enough.

663
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,160
Thank you so much
for telling me about Hawaii.

664
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,880
- Congratulations, Sid.
- Thanks.

665
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,440
Rachel, I cannot tell you how happy I am.

666
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,200
Do you guys want anything?
Do you want a sandwich or anything?

667
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:22,840
You guys must be hungry.
You got aloo gobi, there's cold saagwala.

668
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,160
- I really am pretty sleepy, Dad.
- You really are pretty everything!

669
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,480
And you, too!

670
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,440
Holy cow. This has been one hell of a day.
I think...

671
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,200
If you don't mind, sweetie,
I'm just going...

672
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,880
- No!
- I mean, my God.

673
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,040
- I'm just going to go to bed.
- I'll be right up, dear.

674
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,400
- I just want to load the dishwasher.
- Grandpa.

675
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,760
That's me.

676
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,920
Thanks for taking that.

677
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,280
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Night, night. Sweet dreams.

678
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:59,760
You know, I hope it was okay
that we told Mom at dinner about the baby.

679
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,160
Of course it was, lamb chop.
You should tell her.

680
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,440
I'm just so happy 'cause
I'm going to be a granddaddy.

681
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,800
- I wish Ethan were here.
- You what?

682
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:18,800
- I wish Ethan were here.
- I know, sweetheart. Me, too. Me, too.

683
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,400
- Take that woman.
- You got it.

684
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,440
Just let me know if you need
a hand with any of that.

685
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,800
Get out of here, Sid.

686
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,040
Oh, gosh. Look at that. How exquisite.

687
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,160
- Isn't that pretty?
- I can't borrow this.

688
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,640
What do you carry in here?

689
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:52,000
- A vital organ? A tiny spleen?
- It's divine, really.

690
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,840
You know, Rachel, you really have to
take care of yourself now, you know?

691
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,920
You have to eat properly.
You have to get enough rest.

692
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,080
I will, Mom.

693
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,920
How's everything at the house?
Is it all right?

694
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,400
- Yeah.
- Yeah? How's Sidney?

695
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,840
Good, good.

696
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,200
What about his friend? What's his name?

697
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,760
- Kieran.
- Right.

698
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,560
He was a big hit, wasn't he?

699
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:18,560
- Is your sister behaving herself?
- I'm not exactly sure what that means.

700
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,960
Well, she needs a lot of acknowledgment.

701
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,560
- You think?
- Come on.

702
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,760
It can't be easy.
Everybody knowing your troubles like that.

703
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,200
Stop fretting.

704
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,280
Mom, does it bother you at all,

705
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,000
Carol doing so much stuff for the wedding?

706
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,040
No. I'm thrilled to be doing the flowers.

707
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,040
Come on. You know how much that means
to me. And they're going to be exquisite.

708
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,760
- I bet.
- That's just enough.

709
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,000
But I mean,
you could do whatever you want.

710
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:57,240
I mean, the flowers are going to be great,
and so are you, and...

711
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,920
If you wanted to do anything else I would...

712
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,160
Thank you, sweetheart. No, I don't.

713
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,000
Can you see me? I'd be one of those

714
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:10,760
women, you know, like,
the insane wedding mother,

715
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,000
you know, the hors d'oeuvres, and...

716
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,920
Come on, those little hot dogs? It's not me.

717
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,240
It's going to be perfect.
Everything is going to be so beautiful.

718
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,040
And even your sister is going to have
a good time. It's all great.

719
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,280
And I'm going to be a grandmother!
So hooray!

720
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,600
Hooray!

721
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,440
Here's Grandma's ring. Let's try this.
Try it on.

722
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,240
I hope it's a boy.

723
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,920
Just as long as it's healthy,
that's what you say.

724
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,880
- Hi, I'm Kym. I'm an addict.
- Hi, Kym.

725
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,840
I am nine months clean.

726
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,160
When I was 16,
I was babysitting my little brother.

727
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,880
And I was...

728
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:05,160
I had taken all these Percocet
and I was unbelievably high.

729
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,120
And I...

730
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:13,480
We'd driven over to the park on Lakeshore.

731
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,920
And he was in his red socks,

732
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,640
just running around in these
piles of leaves.

733
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,600
And he would bury me,

734
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:27,440
and I would bury him in the leaves.

735
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:32,080
And he was pretending that he was a train.

736
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,720
And so, he was charging through the leaves,
making tracks.

737
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:42,760
And I was the caboose and I was...
So he kept saying,

738
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:46,120
"Coal, caboose! Coal, caboose!"

739
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,240
And...

740
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:58,200
We were...
It was time to go and I was driving home.

741
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
And

742
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,640
I lost control of the car

743
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,280
and drove off the bridge.

744
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,600
And the car went into the lake.

745
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,320
And I couldn't get him out of his car seat.

746
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,040
And he drowned.

747
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,920
And I struggle with God so much

748
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,080
because I can't forgive myself.

749
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,880
And I don't really want to right now. I can
live with it, but I can't forgive myself.

750
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,280
And sometimes, I don't want to believe
in a god that could forgive me.

751
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,520
But I do want to be sober.

752
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,760
I'm alive and I'm present,
and there's nothing controlling me.

753
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,160
If I hurt someone, I hurt someone.

754
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:02,200
I can apologize
and they can forgive me or not.

755
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,240
But I can change.

756
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:11,120
And I just wanted to share that and say,

757
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,240
congratulations that God makes you
look up. I'm so happy for you.

758
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:18,360
But if he doesn't, come here.
That's all. Thank you.

759
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,000
Thanks for sharing.

760
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,880
Where's... Where's you, Emma?

761
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,080
- Emma, where's you?
- I'm right here.

762
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,800
- It's really raining.
- That's today.

763
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,680
- Done.
- It's going to be fine.

764
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,080
Okay.

765
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,680
It's going to be totally, totally,
totally fine.

766
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,800
All right.

767
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,120
This is what you've got, Emma? So far?

768
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,680
I'm fine. That is kind of perfect.

769
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,640
There's six of each, right?

770
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,680
- Except for me.
- I'm the telephone.

771
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,040
Hey, Rachel! Check it out!

772
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,280
- Oh, my God!
- It's up.

773
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,200
It's going to have walls around it as well.

774
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,680
Yay!

775
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,320
You guys, there's too many at this table.

776
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,240
- Sorry.
- There's too many.

777
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,600
Carol, they're back!

778
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,800
Are you guys hungry?
I made a salad niçoise. It's got tuna.

779
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,560
I was just thinking salad niçoise.

780
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,480
- Dad, can we focus on what we were doing?
- Of course. I'm sorry.

781
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,600
Hey.

782
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,600
The Rosenzwiegs.
Could we put the Rosenzwiegs far from me?

783
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,920
- Dad, they're your friends.
- They are not my friends, darling.

784
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,760
They've just lived next door
to us for 10,000 years.

785
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,240
I am this lovely face right over here.

786
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,120
That is a perfect place to put me in.

787
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,880
Where are you putting me? In the stockade?

788
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,680
Kym, stop it, you're at the family table.

789
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,800
Listen, just don't sit me next to
Michael or Sandy, okay?

790
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,840
They're not invited.

791
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,400
Sandy never responded to
my amends e-mail from Milestones.

792
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,400
I hate it when people
don't meet you halfway.

793
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,120
You know, why don't you give
the amends thing a rest?

794
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,400
You're at the family table with us.

795
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,480
That would make it 13, though.
I think Rachel wanted to keep it to 12.

796
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,680
Right.

797
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,880
Where are you putting me?

798
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,880
I was going to put you with Cookie Puss
and the Chicago cousins

799
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,920
because they always get really drunk
and need wrangling.

800
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,000
Well, can someone else do it?
I was sort of planning on enjoying myself.

801
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,400
- You're the only one they're afraid of.
- No, this is easy.

802
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,480
We can put Grandma Rose
down here with her companion

803
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,880
at this other table,
which is actually a really good idea.

804
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,800
Great. That's all I need. Another reason
for Grandma Rose to hate me.

805
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,400
- She does not hate you.
- Are you kidding?

806
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,760
She's still mad about
the whole Rite Aid thing.

807
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,920
Nonsense!

808
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,320
Dad, can I show you something
in the kitchen?

809
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:02,040
- Eliza, would you excuse us for a moment?
- Yeah.

810
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,320
Thanks.

811
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:08,840
- Rachel, what is this behavior?
- Can I just have a day? Please?

812
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,240
Have all the days you want, darling.
Nobody is trying to take your day.

813
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,320
Then why are you defending her?

814
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,000
Defending her from what?
Rachel, nobody's defending anybody.

815
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,640
Why are you protecting her?

816
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,560
Because I don't want her to think
we don't want her.

817
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:24,680
Sometimes I don't want her.
It's my fucking wedding!

818
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:29,000
- I want my table to be perfect.
- She's your sister. Stop.

819
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:34,320
Let's put the dishes here because
I have to reload this dishwasher, I can see.

820
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,200
Paul, you know...
Paul, I was thinking about it,

821
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,760
and I actually did some preliminary
sketches. I'd love to show them to you.

822
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,320
He's actually...
He's not kidding about this.

823
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,960
- I think that if you move...
- He's been working on this.

824
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,240
If you move things like the salad bowls
on the upper tier,

825
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:50,760
you could probably get about
10% more stuff in the dishwasher, so...

826
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,520
Sidney.

827
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Does he know?

828
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,400
You're showing me how to load
the dishwasher?

829
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,040
I'm showing you how to do it right.

830
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,640
Sidney,

831
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,720
my future son-in-law,
you're a wonderful young man.

832
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:10,080
You'll make a lot of money in this business,
and the world is your oyster,

833
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,080
but you don't know shit
about loading a dishwasher.

834
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,800
Well, with all due respect, sir,
the mantle has passed.

835
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,800
Painful. Painful, sweetie.

836
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,680
All right.

837
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,280
Oh, no!

838
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,560
What, are we timing it?

839
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,800
Yeah, let's work with time,
if you're going to do it right.

840
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,440
- Dad, what's the time limit?
- Go!

841
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,600
- How long do you want to time it?
- Two minutes.

842
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,240
Is that all right?
Are you all right with that, sir?

843
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,920
Would you like me to spot you 30 seconds?

844
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,600
- Go!
- Paul, I think your problem is mainly

845
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,960
in lid placement.

846
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:55,080
Inverting the lids and putting them
in the upper tier is just passé.

847
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:59,120
- It's kind of old-school.
- There's food on that one!

848
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,480
- Thank you, Kymmie.
- Lettuce leaf, lettuce leaf!

849
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,280
Follow the schematic.

850
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:09,000
It might be worth pointing out
that the dishes need to be rinsed.

851
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,960
- Are you shaking in your boots?
- You got 20 seconds.

852
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,600
Fifteen seconds left.

853
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,280
Rachel, darling, you are out of the will.
You know that?

854
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:25,640
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

855
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:31,080
five, four, three, two, one...

856
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,760
You know, all you young people
who are applauding,

857
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,440
you should go fuck yourselves.

858
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,280
- Sweetie, keep it clean!
- No, I'm just saying.

859
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,080
- It's a wonderful attempt, Son.
- Okay. I tried to fix it.

860
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,240
Kieran, if you could clean out
that machine, I will then be able

861
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,600
to break out the whoop-ass
on this young man here.

862
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,400
He's breaking out the whoop-ass!

863
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,120
- Let's break out the whoop-ass.
- Break out the whoop-ass.

864
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,840
When that machine is empty,
I will show you how it's done.

865
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,440
What is this whoop-ass you speak of?

866
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:08,240
You should rest. You should rest. Really.

867
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,560
- Silverware is a part of the art.
- Okay, all right.

868
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,280
I will say that Sidney had
a little time to survey things.

869
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,400
He did a little planning
and made some sketches.

870
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:24,000
But that's all right.
I'm ready any time you say "go. "

871
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,520
Go!

872
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,400
$5! $5 on the geezer!

873
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,040
Rinsing!

874
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:37,960
Go, Dad!

875
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,000
Here, Son. Have some.

876
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,760
Cup handles!

877
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,760
Side load!

878
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,680
I didn't know about side load.

879
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,080
He's good.

880
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,160
Buchman, in front of your family.

881
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,440
Buchman, your women will weep.

882
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:04,960
Last one!

883
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,240
- Could I have my time, please?
- You have 15 seconds left.

884
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,160
Fifteen seconds left and I need more dishes!

885
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,080
Somebody give me more dishes!

886
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,360
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad!

887
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,320
- Don't get cocky, keep it going.
- Where we at? Kieran?

888
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,280
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

889
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:34,080
five, four, three, two, one...

890
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,040
- All right.
- That's it, man. That's...

891
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,080
What?

892
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,120
Where are you going?

893
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,400
Let's grab some lemonade on the porch.

894
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,600
Is everything okay?

895
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,840
- Hey!
- See you later.

896
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,560
I have to. I mean...

897
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,680
I mean, if I could do it the way
I wanted to do it. Literally...

898
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,400
Hey, Rach? Are you getting a manicure?

899
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,240
Hi.

900
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,040
You don't remember me, do you?

901
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,400
Oh, my God.

902
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,360
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

903
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,520
God is punishing me.

904
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:49,000
No, no, he's blessing me.

905
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,680
Well. Wow.

906
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,760
- So, how are you?
- I'm great. I'm great.

907
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:58,320
You remember?
We were in the hospital together, right?

908
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,800
We were... Were you at Milestones?

909
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,000
No. I didn't go to Milestones.
I didn't have the coverage.

910
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:06,720
We were on the same floor at Loeb House.

911
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,240
Okay.

912
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:12,400
- You look great.
- Twenty-eight months, clean and sober.

913
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,400
Praise God.

914
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,840
Amen.

915
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:22,080
I can't believe that I'm seeing you again.

916
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,040
I know. It's so weird.

917
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,200
Listen.

918
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,160
Do you remember that exercise

919
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,240
where we had to write down experiences

920
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,560
and pass them anonymously
to another person?

921
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,520
Yeah. Yeah, the human mirror.

922
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,160
Seeing things from a fresh perspective.

923
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,520
I got yours.

924
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,480
You drew poodles in the margins.

925
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,280
I know it's supposed to be anonymous
and everything...

926
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,280
- Yeah.
... but you...

927
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:58,880
You

928
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,280
were so brave.

929
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,360
The way your uncle abused
you and your sister

930
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,320
and how it led to your sister's anorexia.

931
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,160
And how you stayed up nights with her
when she was down to 50 pounds.

932
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,240
I will never forget reading that,

933
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,320
- I swear to God.
- Yeah.

934
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,200
I never, ever, thought I would have
the chance to thank you.

935
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,080
It was your strength

936
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,880
that gave me the courage

937
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,280
to confront my own abuse
and help turn my life around.

938
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,880
- Listen, I'm in a great group.
- Rachel. I...

939
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,360
I'm so glad to hear it. Excuse me.
Sir, just stop.

940
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,000
Sorry, I just need a second. Rachel?

941
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,600
Rachel?

942
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,680
Rachel, what are you doing?

943
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,400
Where... Where are you going?

944
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,640
Rachel!

945
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,520
You know, I never had anorexia.

946
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:57,840
And you certainly didn't watch over me
while I was sleeping.

947
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,840
And we don't have a

948
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,920
goddamned pedophile uncle
who made our childhood a living hell

949
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:07,120
and explains away all your shit
in one fell swoop.

950
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:10,640
Did you tell them that Dad forced us
into a life of prostitution as well?

951
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,360
I wasn't hurting... No one got hurt, Rach.

952
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,880
- I'm hurt.
- Where are you going?

953
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:20,080
Rachel, open the door. Rachel!

954
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,760
So what, you're just going?

955
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,880
- I'm sorry, but I hate her.
- No, you don't hate her.

956
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,560
Dad, don't tell me what I don't hate.

957
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:48,400
I hate, hate, hate the lies.
I mean, she lied in rehab.

958
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,760
What do you mean, she lied?

959
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,920
I mean, she lied to the people
who were working with her,

960
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,880
who were trying to help her.
Dad, she lies to everybody.

961
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,760
Where is she now?

962
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,360
- Where am I now, Dad?
- Thank God.

963
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,440
- Rachel!
- We're in here, Kym.

964
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,880
Thanks for abandoning me.
I had to take a taxi.

965
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,240
Hey, Rach.

966
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,000
I mean, are you kidding me?

967
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:18,480
Why would anything I said or didn't say
at the hospital...

968
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,920
Jesus Christ!
Are they going to play all weekend?

969
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,560
- Knock it off!
- Norman! Boys! Stop, please!

970
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,960
Guys, would you give it a rest?
Just give it a rest.

971
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,520
Why would it hurt you? It wasn't about you!

972
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,120
- Why not?
- Rachel.

973
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,240
What? Stop, Dad. Why not?
Why wasn't it about me?

974
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,440
I mean, I was hopeful.

975
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,240
I was on your side. Still am.
Do you have any idea what that means?

976
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,080
Do you have any idea

977
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:52,560
how lonely it was here with everybody gone

978
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,760
into your

979
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:00,000
terrible little world?
I mean, there was nothing left.

980
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,800
Everybody was just empty.

981
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,720
You think that they

982
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,720
knew I was alive
or needed anything during your

983
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:14,960
life?

984
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,960
And after all that, the fights,
the screaming,

985
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:22,080
the blaming, the loneliness,

986
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:26,000
and Mom and Dad and the divorce and

987
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,560
death

988
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,440
and all that fucking hopefulness, I mean...

989
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:38,480
And Dad not even being able to listen
to music any more.

990
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:42,880
You were lying about us instead of
telling the truth about yourself.

991
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,560
God, Rach.

992
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,280
What is this about, girls?

993
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,840
Well, apparently, she has a whole history

994
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:52,080
of sexual molestation
that we didn't know about.

995
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,360
- What?
- God.

996
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:58,480
Kym, what is your sister saying?
Did you say you were sexually molested?

997
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,840
It was a long time ago.

998
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:03,840
Were you?

999
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:04,880
No!

1000
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,120
Why in God's name
would you say something like that?

1001
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,680
It was an anonymous exercise.
And it seemed like a good idea at the time.

1002
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,160
Dad, look at me. Okay? I am right here.

1003
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,320
Okay?
And I am telling you that after Ethan died,

1004
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:17,840
I wanted her to get better orjust die.

1005
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:20,400
- Rachel, she's better.
- And... No, no.

1006
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,440
Recovery doesn't work if you lie.
She knows that.

1007
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,000
I am worthless to her.

1008
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:30,320
- She doesn't give a shit about the rest of
us! - You are not worthless. How dare you!

1009
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,040
You're my sister.

1010
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:40,200
I love you guys.
I need you guys, but you don't

1011
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:44,560
get to sit around
for the rest of my life deciding

1012
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:47,600
what I'm supposed to be like.
I mean, you weren't there.

1013
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:51,360
You weren't inside of my head
when I was fucked-up.

1014
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,680
- You are certainly not there now.
- Kym.

1015
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,880
You haven't got any idea how I feel.

1016
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,920
Kym, you took Ethan for granted.

1017
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:04,240
Okay. You were high for his life.
You were not present.

1018
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,600
- Okay. You were high.
- Yes.

1019
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,320
And you drove him off a bridge.
And now he's dead.

1020
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:13,040
- Rachel, it was an accident.
- Yes, I was.

1021
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,480
Yes, I was stoned out of my mind.

1022
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,480
Who do I have to be now?

1023
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:28,240
I could be Mother Theresa.
It wouldn't make a difference what I did.

1024
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,960
Did I sacrifice every bit of

1025
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:36,320
love in this life because
I killed our little brother?

1026
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,560
- It was an accident. It was an accident.
- And I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1027
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:43,240
- Kymmie, Kymmie, it was an accident.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1028
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,360
I'm sorry, too, Dad.

1029
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:27,680
Can I...

1030
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:30,800
I'm sorry, guys. I just want to...
If I can say something.

1031
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,800
Look, I know you're... You're, you know...

1032
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,920
Everyone's concerned about her,
where she might be.

1033
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,800
Listen, you know,
when you're getting out of rehab,

1034
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:43,040
it's very, very difficult
and it's especially difficult to go

1035
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,520
to see your family. I mean, it just...

1036
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:49,680
I mean, when I...
When I got out, I didn't see them for years.

1037
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:54,320
And it just really takes time,
and I... And...

1038
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,120
If you're not ready to take
responsibility for something,

1039
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:00,160
people make something up,
which is probably what happened, but...

1040
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:03,840
I mean, you know,
honestly, Rachel, that happened like...

1041
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,040
It was a couple of years ago...

1042
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:07,040
Paul, do you want me to go out
and look for her?

1043
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,240
No.

1044
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:12,800
You can't. I mean, you have
a wedding tomorrow. A hundred people...

1045
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,680
I'll go. I mean, you know...
It's fine. I'll go.

1046
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,440
- Where are you going to go?
- I can take a look for her.

1047
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,200
Do you guys know where she might be, or...

1048
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,400
Hello?

1049
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,520
I'm sorry?

1050
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:44,400
It's the caterer.

1051
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:46,880
- Let me deal with it.
- I'll tell you what.

1052
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,160
Hello?

1053
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,200
You should really call Daddy, honey.

1054
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,760
Yeah, okay. In a minute.

1055
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,480
- You know how he worries.
- I will in a minute, yeah.

1056
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:00,640
You know, he's worried, honey.

1057
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:01,840
I need a glass of water.

1058
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,520
Here. I made tea.

1059
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,720
Come sit down, honey. You look so upset.

1060
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:13,760
Is Andrew going to be home soon?

1061
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,560
Yes. He just went to a dinner. Not late.

1062
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,560
Did something happen
with you and Rachel?

1063
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,440
Is everything all right with the wedding?

1064
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,840
- Yeah.
- Good.

1065
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:34,520
Why did you leave me in charge of him?

1066
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:40,560
You knew. All of you knew.

1067
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,480
- Kym.
- People told you.

1068
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:47,280
I was a junkie. I was a crazy drug addict.

1069
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,800
- I stole from you.
- Yes.

1070
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,760
I lied to your face.

1071
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,440
I weighed six pounds.
My hair was falling out.

1072
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:00,160
- I spent every dinner in the bathroom.
- Honey, you were sick.

1073
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,800
- That was an illness.
- You know what I was.

1074
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:07,600
I stayed in my room for days.
I passed out all the time.

1075
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,080
No, no.

1076
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:11,200
- What were you thinking?
- No.

1077
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,040
Why did you leave me?

1078
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,520
I was there. I didn't leave you.

1079
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,240
Why would you leave me in charge of him?

1080
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,040
Because you were good with him.

1081
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:24,560
- Mom, Mom, why would you leave...
- No, you were...

1082
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,000
...a drug addict to watch your son?

1083
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,000
No! You were good with him!

1084
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,600
- You were the best you were with him!
- Listen to me! Listen!

1085
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:35,600
I didn't expect you to kill him, sweetheart!

1086
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,200
- You were not supposed to kill him!
- Mom!

1087
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,280
Mom! What are you doing? Get off!

1088
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,680
- Oh, God! God!
- Mom!

1089
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,240
Fuck.

1090
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:02,760
Are you okay, miss?

1091
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,040
Right over here. It's a mess.

1092
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,520
It's Kym. I'm fine.

1093
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:50,960
I...

1094
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:57,960
- Thanks a lot.
- No problem.

1095
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,080
Hi.

1096
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,120
I'm the maid of honor.

1097
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,920
Cool. I know you.

1098
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,640
I used to work at that dog-grooming place.

1099
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:33,040
You holding?

1100
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,040
- Kymmie?
- Oh, God, Dad.

1101
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:40,600
- Kymmie, are... Oh, God. Are you all right?
- Yeah. I just need to go.

1102
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:41,680
No, we've got to get to the hospital.

1103
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:42,800
No, Dad. I need to get dressed.

1104
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,120
- Kymmie, we've got to get you
to a hospital. - I'm fine, please.

1105
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,800
Kym, you can't just vanish.
You can't just leave.

1106
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:49,400
You have to call, now.
You always have to call.

1107
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,480
I know.

1108
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,000
Fuck.

1109
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,840
Come here.

1110
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,040
- Fuck. I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

1111
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,800
Goes in, like, 12 directions.

1112
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,760
I'm so happy you're home.

1113
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:02,440
And see if you can fold it
into three pieces at the top.

1114
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,480
Okay, hold on. Let me try.

1115
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,040
You were right about the gray.

1116
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:42,320
- Rachel, Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
- Sidney, Sidney, Sidney, Sidney

1117
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:50,800
- Rachel, Rachel
- Sidney, Sidney

1118
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:03,920
We've come together
to show our support for

1119
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,280
Sidney and Rachel in theirjoining hands

1120
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:10,520
and in joining themselves together
in holy wedlock.

1121
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:15,880
The weather's been pretty miserable
all weekend, but now it's a beautiful day.

1122
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:19,160
And it's a beautiful day because
when two people come together

1123
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:23,080
who really love one another
and want to share that with other people,

1124
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,200
it makes it a beautiful day.

1125
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:30,920
So Sidney Williams and Rachel Buchman
have come do to that.

1126
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,920
And, Rachel, you go first.

1127
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:37,240
Paul Buchman likes to say

1128
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:41,960
that the measure of a great life is

1129
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:44,600
not how well loved you are,

1130
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:47,480
but how well you love others.

1131
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,840
Sidney, you teach me that every day.

1132
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:56,400
You are just so full of grace,

1133
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:02,920
and I promise before God
and these beautiful people

1134
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,480
that I will love you fiercely

1135
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:08,840
and sweetly.

1136
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:14,440
And I look forward to sharing
that great life with you.

1137
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,040
Thank you for marrying me.

1138
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:29,640
All that I ever wanted was
to just hear music,

1139
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,080
and when I met you, I heard you.

1140
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:40,280
And, Rachel, you're the most beautiful thing
I've ever heard.

1141
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,080
Thank you for marrying me.

1142
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,160
You're welcome.

1143
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,840
She used to work in a diner

1144
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:56,840
Never saw a woman look finer

1145
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:03,000
I used to orderjust to watch her
float across the floor

1146
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:08,080
She grew up in a small town

1147
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,800
Never put her roots down

1148
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:18,120
Daddy always kept moving, so she did, too

1149
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:23,280
You know it ain't easy

1150
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:27,360
You got to hold on

1151
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:32,960
She was an unknown legend in her time

1152
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:38,280
Now she's dressing two kids

1153
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:42,720
Looking for a magic kiss

1154
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:47,800
She gets the faraway look in her eyes

1155
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:53,760
Somewhere on a desert highway

1156
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:58,440
She rides a Harley-Davidson

1157
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:03,760
Her long brown hair flying in the wind

1158
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:09,000
She's been running half her life

1159
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:14,760
The chrome and steel she rides
colliding with

1160
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:18,160
The very air she breathes

1161
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:22,120
The air she breathes

1162
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:27,480
Do we have some rings?

1163
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:46,120
Sidney, you go first
and place the ring on Rachel's hand.

1164
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:49,640
Do you?

1165
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:51,600
Yeah, I do.

1166
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:55,880
Sidney does. Do you, Rachel?

1167
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:01,800
I do.

1168
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:03,400
All right.

1169
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:08,000
By the power vested in me by
the state of Connecticut and by Neil Young,

1170
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:13,600
I pronounce that they are husband and wife,
and now you can kiss him.

1171
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:20,520
Okay. We're going to cut the cake.
Everybody who wants to see it, come now.

1172
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:25,160
Tastes like lime and turmeric.
It's got, like, turmeric in it.

1173
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,400
Baby Boy, let them take the picture.

1174
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:29,400
Yeah, Baby Boy.

1175
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,840
Can we all do this together?

1176
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:43,640
Everybody.

1177
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,080
Kym?

1178
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,720
Wait. Where's... Where's Kym?

1179
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,000
I'm here.

1180
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:50,960
Mom?

1181
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,840
- Dear God...
- Wait, wait, wait. Mom.

1182
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:56,800
Okay, look at the camera. One, two, three.

1183
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,600
That's great. Thank you.

1184
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:04,200
Dear God, please bless this family and
let them always invite us over for dinner,

1185
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:07,200
because God knows
my new wife cannot boil water or fry an egg.

1186
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:56,400
And now a word from our sponsor.

1187
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,960
Mr. Buchman, if you please!

1188
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:07,000
I'm getting now to the Williams family.
It's a done deal. We're relatives.

1189
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:11,400
We were fortunate that they could be
joined by Specialist Joseph Gonzales.

1190
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:15,280
Son, we want you home and we want you
to put that damn camera down.

1191
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:03,080
Hey.

1192
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:04,920
- Hey.
- Sorry.

1193
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,360
No. Come in.

1194
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,600
Come on.

1195
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:12,800
Have you seen Mom?

1196
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:16,600
No, she's probably taking a break.

1197
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:20,080
How do you take a break from your own
daughter's wedding?

1198
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:24,120
You know Mom. She doesn't really...

1199
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,240
Oh, yeah. Here's the party?

1200
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:35,760
Okay, this is too cute for me.

1201
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,240
- Hello?
- Hello?

1202
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:41,240
Rachel. Well, here you all are.
I've been looking all over for you.

1203
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:42,360
Hey.

1204
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,840
So lovely. I'm truly...

1205
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:47,680
- Abby?
- Yeah?

1206
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,240
- They're bringing the car around.
- Okay. Great.

1207
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:51,560
Wait. You're leaving?

1208
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:55,240
Honey, I'm so exhausted,
but I had such a marvelous time.

1209
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:58,640
Everything was great. Carol and Daddy
really did a great job, don't you think?

1210
01:34:58,720 --> 01:34:59,960
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1211
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:04,440
Okay, I just didn't want to make a
big scene. We're just going to slip away.

1212
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:09,840
- You could make a little scene.
- Well, I'm making it. Right?

1213
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:14,320
Andrew and I have to go to Washington
tomorrow. So we're going to take off.

1214
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:15,840
Why are you going to Washington?

1215
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:19,480
I thought I told you. No?
We'll just be a week.

1216
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:24,040
We have a bunch of meetings. But you guys
are going away real soon, right?

1217
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:30,200
What about our post-nuptial
wedding gossip reconnaissance, Mom?

1218
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:32,960
Well, you could come by in the morning.

1219
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:35,000
Yeah...

1220
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:39,000
No, no, that's a stupid idea. Don't call
me early. It's your wedding night.

1221
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:41,680
You're not going to get up early.
That was silly. Anyway...

1222
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:45,880
I have to get Andrew ready
'cause he's absolutely hopeless in this way.

1223
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:48,120
So...
We'll just be a bit and then we'll be back.

1224
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:51,320
Everything was so lovely,
even the weather cooperated.

1225
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:53,720
It was beautiful, honey. Okay.

1226
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,160
Wait.

1227
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:59,840
I want my mother and my sister.

1228
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:06,760
- Congratulations, Daddy.
- Thanks.

1229
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:11,160
All right, Rachel.

1230
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:14,960
- All right, Rach. Okay.
- Okay.

1231
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:19,640
- You'll call me every day about you know...
- Yes. Of course.

1232
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:23,280
- You take care. All right?
- Bye.

1233
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:26,920
- Son-in-law.
- Mother-in-law.

1234
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:32,280
Take care of yourself.

1235
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:39,000
- Paul, Carol, it was so lovely.
- Thank you.

1236
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:41,240
- Get some rest.
- Okay.

1237
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:53,800
I can't find my cigarettes.
Just give me a second.

1238
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:55,160
Kymmie. Kym.

1239
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:59,280
You remember Susanna Galeano?

1240
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:01,320
- Hi.
- Hi, Kym. How are you?

1241
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:04,480
Suzy runs a first rate PR firm and, darling,

1242
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:06,720
she has just lost an office assistant.

1243
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,480
We really are down a person.
And I was wondering,

1244
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:13,520
have you ever
thought about public relations?

1245
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:16,640
The public's kind of afraid of me.

1246
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:20,400
Listen, Suzy
is opening a new office right here.

1247
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:22,680
- Darling, you could be at home.
- I tell you what.

1248
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:24,480
- Why don't you call me on Monday?
- Give her a card.

1249
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:26,760
- And we can talk about it?
- That would be great.

1250
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:28,240
- This is just too perfect.
- It's stuck, here we go.

1251
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,880
- Thank you.
- Paul, it was beautiful.

1252
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:31,960
- I'm gonna have to go.
- Suzy, Suzy, thank you. I know.

1253
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:33,440
You look wonderful.

1254
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:37,400
Do you want me
to hold that card now for you?

1255
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:39,960
No, no. I got it. Just... Give me a second.
I'll be back in a minute.

1256
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:41,040
Okay.

1257
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:18,720
Hello?

1258
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:24,240
You making a break for it?

1259
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:26,840
Yeah.

1260
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:29,240
Yeah, I got to go.

1261
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:31,720
Yeah. Okay.

1262
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,880
If you ever need anything...

1263
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:38,480
If I need to post bond?

1264
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:42,680
No. If you ever need anything.

1265
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:49,560
Thank you.

1266
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,880
Maybe you'll come visit me in Hawaii.

1267
01:39:57,160 --> 01:40:00,440
- That would be nice.
- Yes, it would.

1268
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:22,880
- I got to go.
- Okay.

1269
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:25,640
- I got it.
- Okay.

1270
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:33,800
Kym.

1271
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,680
Daddy?

1272
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:57,960
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1273
01:40:58,040 --> 01:41:00,560
- How you feeling?
- I'm okay.

1274
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:02,080
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1275
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:08,760
You should probably just ignore the eye.
It's a long story.

1276
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:10,360
- Okay.
- Kymmie.

1277
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:12,320
Hey.

1278
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:16,240
- Hey, I'm Kym's sister.
- Hi.

1279
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,200
- This is Rosa.
- Rachel.

1280
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:20,880
Rachel, I heard a lot about you.
You got married.

1281
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:22,360
- I did, yeah.
- Congratulations.

1282
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:23,680
Thank you.

1283
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:42,520
I love your baby.

1284
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:45,400
Me, too.

1285
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:58,400
- Great.
- Nice to meet you.
