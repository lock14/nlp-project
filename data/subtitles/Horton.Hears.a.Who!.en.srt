1
00:03:22,597 --> 00:03:23,612
Yeah!

2
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:26,621
<i>On the 15th of May, in the jungle of Nool,</i>

3
00:03:26,694 --> 00:03:29,859
<i>in the heat of the day,</i>
<i>in the cool of the pool,</i>

4
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:33,224
<i>he was splashing,</i>
<i>enjoying the jungle's great joys,</i>

5
00:03:36,426 --> 00:03:39,776
<i>when Horton the Elephant</i>
<i>heard a small noise.</i>

6
00:03:49,902 --> 00:03:51,113
- Horton!
- Horton!

7
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:54,060
Good morning, class. Are you ready?

8
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,102
- Yeah!
- Jump on board!

9
00:03:57,072 --> 00:03:58,698
Look out below!

10
00:03:58,801 --> 00:04:01,519
Tommy's on board. Katie, you there?

11
00:04:04,307 --> 00:04:05,714
Okay.

12
00:04:08,116 --> 00:04:09,971
There it is.

13
00:04:10,037 --> 00:04:14,064
This is one of the jungle's most
amazing creatures, the leaf bug.

14
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:18,640
In order to protect itself from predators,
it disguises itself as a leaf.

15
00:04:24,248 --> 00:04:27,413
This one's got quite a grip.
Come on, little buddy.

16
00:04:27,481 --> 00:04:28,911
Don't be shy.

17
00:04:31,516 --> 00:04:33,753
I guess I was mistaken, kids.

18
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:37,233
There are obviously no leaf bugs
in this area. Even if...

19
00:04:37,341 --> 00:04:38,967
No, they're on me!

20
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,815
I think I swallowed one!

21
00:04:46,496 --> 00:04:47,925
Tommy! Pull it out!

22
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:49,594
Uh, okay.

23
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:57,283
<i>Then humpfing a "humpf"</i>
<i>was a sour Kangaroo,</i>

24
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,282
<i>the type who's convinced</i>
<i>she knows better than you.</i>

25
00:05:00,388 --> 00:05:03,422
<i>She made every law</i>
<i>and enforced every rule</i>

26
00:05:03,493 --> 00:05:06,626
<i>as self-proclaimed</i>
<i>head of the jungle of Nool.</i>

27
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,764
Why can't I play with the other kids, Mom?

28
00:05:09,863 --> 00:05:11,293
How many times have I told you that

29
00:05:11,368 --> 00:05:14,500
the jungle is no place
to act like a wild animal.

30
00:05:24,876 --> 00:05:27,266
My, that Horton certainly is eccentric.

31
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:30,124
And the children are learning
so much from him.

32
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,257
Learning to be a bunch
of harebrained half-wits!

33
00:05:33,487 --> 00:05:36,303
And that's why my Rudy
is pouch-schooled.

34
00:05:36,688 --> 00:05:39,307
<i>So while Kangaroo stood there,</i>
<i>sneering a sneer...</i>

35
00:05:39,408 --> 00:05:41,264
Horton, that was the best time
I've ever had in my life!

36
00:05:41,362 --> 00:05:41,863
What are you gonna show us next?

37
00:05:43,026 --> 00:05:46,704
<i>... once again, the speck floated</i>
<i>right by Horton's ear.</i>

38
00:05:48,084 --> 00:05:50,867
<i>Then he heard it again,</i>
<i>just a very faint yelp,</i>

39
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:53,332
<i>as if some tiny person</i>
<i>were calling for help.</i>

40
00:05:56,918 --> 00:05:58,228
<i>And you know what he thought?</i>

41
00:05:58,327 --> 00:06:00,083
<i>Why, he thought that</i>
<i>there must be someone</i>

42
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,935
<i>on top of that small speck of dust!</i>

43
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:05,238
<i>Or even a family, it just might be so,</i>

44
00:06:05,337 --> 00:06:07,956
<i>a family with children</i>
<i>just starting to grow.</i>

45
00:06:10,811 --> 00:06:11,891
I want to live!

46
00:06:14,492 --> 00:06:17,111
I gotta go. Katie, you're in charge!

47
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,458
Wait!

48
00:06:22,526 --> 00:06:24,534
- Come back!
- Watch it!

49
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:51,809
One more! One more! One more!

50
00:06:57,738 --> 00:07:00,422
- I hear someone coming!
- Give me those!

51
00:07:01,643 --> 00:07:03,553
- Wait!
- Sound the alarm!

52
00:07:07,245 --> 00:07:09,483
Excuse me. Pardon my stampede!

53
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:13,572
Sorry, Wickershams! I promise
I'm gonna clean all this up later!

54
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:15,173
Bring the ammo!

55
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:26,312
I love the smell of bananas in the morning.

56
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:29,391
Banana in the hole!

57
00:07:30,132 --> 00:07:32,555
Come on, guys! We're all mammals!

58
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,646
I feel the diplomatic process
is beginning to break down.

59
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:42,800
There you are! I got you!

60
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,535
Hi, kids!

61
00:07:57,117 --> 00:07:58,230
Wow.

62
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:03,192
There.

63
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,656
Now you're safe.

64
00:08:06,656 --> 00:08:10,006
I know I heard you say something.
I just know it.

65
00:08:11,778 --> 00:08:13,240
Where are you?

66
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:21,852
Horton!

67
00:08:21,925 --> 00:08:23,135
Sorry!

68
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:28,933
I just... There was this speck,
and it called out for help.

69
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:31,519
- And I was...
- The speck called out for help?

70
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:34,854
Well, not the speck.
I mean, that's ridiculous.

71
00:08:36,521 --> 00:08:39,784
Is that what you thought I meant?
No, the speck can't call out for help.

72
00:08:39,883 --> 00:08:41,989
Come on, get real.

73
00:08:43,404 --> 00:08:47,114
No, there's a tiny person on that speck
that needs my help.

74
00:08:47,789 --> 00:08:51,106
Absurd. There aren't people that small!

75
00:08:51,342 --> 00:08:53,579
Well, maybe they aren't small.

76
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,237
- Maybe we're big.
- Horton.

77
00:08:56,304 --> 00:09:00,583
No, really, think about it.
What if there was someone way out there

78
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:03,438
looking down on our world right now?

79
00:09:03,506 --> 00:09:05,710
And to them, we're the specks.

80
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,629
And then, maybe someone else
will come along and say,

81
00:09:07,732 --> 00:09:10,034
"Oh, there can't be people that small",
and the first guy would say,

82
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,147
"Are you calling me a liar?"

83
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:13,839
And the second guy would say,
"If the shoe fits, wear it!"

84
00:09:13,909 --> 00:09:16,277
And now the fists are flying,
and the first guy picks up a brick,

85
00:09:16,374 --> 00:09:18,961
and you might want to zip up the pouch
for this next part.

86
00:09:19,031 --> 00:09:20,787
"All right, fat boy,
you want some of this..."

87
00:09:20,887 --> 00:09:22,033
- Horton!
- What?

88
00:09:22,136 --> 00:09:24,406
There is nothing on that speck.

89
00:09:25,849 --> 00:09:27,605
- But I heard.
- Did you?

90
00:09:27,674 --> 00:09:29,911
Really? Oh, my.

91
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:32,885
Then how come I don't hear anything?

92
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:35,033
Well...

93
00:09:36,093 --> 00:09:40,218
If you can't see, hear or feel something,

94
00:09:40,286 --> 00:09:41,912
it doesn't exist.

95
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,949
And believing in tiny, imaginary people

96
00:09:45,055 --> 00:09:49,082
is just not something we do or tolerate,

97
00:09:49,184 --> 00:09:51,094
here in the jungle of Nool.

98
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:55,448
Really? Because I bet if I really tried,
I could find somebody who'd believe

99
00:09:55,522 --> 00:09:57,181
- what I've been saying.
- You will do nothing of the sort.

100
00:09:57,251 --> 00:10:02,141
You will not breathe a word of this lie
to anyone else, especially the children.

101
00:10:02,213 --> 00:10:05,891
I do not want you poisoning their minds
with this nonsense.

102
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:09,245
Our community has standards, Horton.

103
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,280
If you want to remain a part of it,
I recommend you follow them.

104
00:10:14,825 --> 00:10:16,418
Have a nice day.

105
00:10:19,946 --> 00:10:23,177
All right, then,
I'll take that under advisement.

106
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:24,869
Certainly appreciate your input.

107
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:30,635
I don't understand. I know I heard you.

108
00:10:30,862 --> 00:10:33,546
It was as plain as the nose on my face.

109
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,837
That's it. Maybe you can't hear me.

110
00:10:37,552 --> 00:10:41,744
Of course! Your ears must be tiny.
I need to speak up.

111
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,248
Hello!

112
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:49,868
<i>Now some people out there,</i>
<i>I think I know who,</i>

113
00:10:49,972 --> 00:10:52,875
<i>may find they agree</i>
<i>with that sour Kangaroo.</i>

114
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:56,689
<i>"There can't really be people</i>
<i>as small as a mite. "

115
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:01,364
<i>Well, there can, and there are,</i>
<i>because Horton was right.</i>

116
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:13,240
<i>Hello!</i>

117
00:11:16,061 --> 00:11:18,647
<i>That single "hello" traveled</i>
<i>all the way down</i>

118
00:11:18,717 --> 00:11:22,777
<i>to the speck, through the clouds,</i>
<i>until it found a small town.</i>

119
00:11:23,423 --> 00:11:26,457
<i>A town known as Whoville,</i>
<i>for there lived the Whos,</i>

120
00:11:26,528 --> 00:11:29,726
<i>feeling happy and safe,</i>
<i>knowing only good news,</i>

121
00:11:29,824 --> 00:11:33,208
<i>unaware that their world</i>
<i>was a speck on a clover,</i>

122
00:11:33,282 --> 00:11:36,217
<i>unaware that the sweet life</i>
<i>they knew might be over.</i>

123
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,720
- Over!
- Under!

124
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,323
<i>The Mayor of Whoville,</i>
<i>a man named McDodd,</i>

125
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:46,878
<i>was devoted and fair and a little bit odd.</i>

126
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:06,657
<i>The Mayor and his wife,</i>
<i>they had children to spare,</i>

127
00:12:06,764 --> 00:12:10,027
<i>96 daughters, some here and some there.</i>

128
00:12:10,926 --> 00:12:14,604
<i>96 girls to love, 96 girls to teach,</i>

129
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,793
<i>but the Mayor had only</i>
<i>a few seconds for each.</i>

130
00:12:19,729 --> 00:12:22,544
Daddy, I got better than best
on my Who-story test.

131
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,682
Who-story. I remember it well.

132
00:12:24,754 --> 00:12:26,216
That's one of my girls.

133
00:12:26,322 --> 00:12:29,389
- Hildy's been using my hairbrush!
- Holly's been using my hairbrush!

134
00:12:29,492 --> 00:12:31,085
Look! Over there!

135
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:33,579
There. All better.

136
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:37,264
Can I please have a Who-phone, Dad?
Everyone else in my class has one.

137
00:12:37,366 --> 00:12:39,155
Oh, really? Everyone?

138
00:12:42,232 --> 00:12:43,639
I will think about it.

139
00:12:43,736 --> 00:12:45,744
Daddy, look! Daddy, look!

140
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,442
Toof.

141
00:12:51,515 --> 00:12:53,425
It's a "T-H", sweetheart. It's "tooth."

142
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,306
<i>In Whoville tradition, unlike yours or mine,</i>

143
00:12:56,412 --> 00:12:58,998
<i>the Mayor's oldest is next</i>
<i>in the Mayoral line.</i>

144
00:12:59,101 --> 00:13:01,404
<i>And who was the oldest?</i>
<i>To lead and stand tall?</i>

145
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:04,536
<i>It was JoJo, his son,</i>
<i>the smallest Who of all.</i>

146
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:09,529
So, JoJo, what's shaking?
What's happening? What's the word?

147
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,921
<i>Now, to you or to me, it's abundantly clear</i>

148
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,961
<i>that JoJo did not want his father's career.</i>

149
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:19,648
<i>But the Mayor pressed forward,</i>
<i>completely deluded,</i>

150
00:13:20,804 --> 00:13:24,067
<i>while JoJo just sat there in silence</i>
<i>and brooded.</i>

151
00:13:27,527 --> 00:13:29,120
Oh, JoJo!

152
00:13:30,471 --> 00:13:32,414
- Hey, why does he get more time?
- That's not fair.

153
00:13:33,448 --> 00:13:34,822
Son! Hey!

154
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:36,318
<i>And why didn't he speak?</i>

155
00:13:36,425 --> 00:13:40,998
<i>Well, I think that the lad was afraid</i>
<i>if he did, he might let down his dad.</i>

156
00:13:41,323 --> 00:13:43,178
You know what's awesome?

157
00:13:43,275 --> 00:13:45,064
This is awesome.

158
00:13:45,164 --> 00:13:49,508
Just look at the men and women
hanging on these walls.

159
00:13:49,837 --> 00:13:55,273
You, my boy, are part of a family legacy
that spans centuries.

160
00:13:55,823 --> 00:14:00,298
You know what?
Your grandfather was Mayor of Whoville,

161
00:14:01,553 --> 00:14:05,744
and your great-grandmother, that's right,

162
00:14:06,194 --> 00:14:08,683
all the way down to your

163
00:14:10,004 --> 00:14:14,161
great-great-great-great-not-so-great-

164
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:18,386
great-great-great-great-great-great-
great-great-great-great-

165
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:21,847
grandfather.

166
00:14:24,088 --> 00:14:26,292
Someday I hope to join them.

167
00:14:27,162 --> 00:14:28,885
Be one of the greats.

168
00:14:28,954 --> 00:14:33,232
I tell you, JoJo, there is nothing
like being Mayor.

169
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:37,050
I get to sign resolutions,
approve ordinances, submit budgets,

170
00:14:37,117 --> 00:14:41,690
and in the Edible Parade, I'm the one
sitting on top of the giant meatball.

171
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,966
Someday, that can be you, too, JoJo.

172
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:51,962
Someday you'll be the one wearing
the Mayoral Crest.

173
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:55,741
You just... You just need to...

174
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,906
You know what I mean?

175
00:15:00,804 --> 00:15:02,714
Okay. Good chat.

176
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,942
I'm glad that we had this talk

177
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:11,942
that I'm continuing now by myself. Good.

178
00:15:18,954 --> 00:15:21,191
There. That ought to be comfy.

179
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:29,196
Nothing wrong with this, Morton.
Nothing wrong with this.

180
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,962
Just you, me and the speck,
shooting the breeze.

181
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:38,476
We're a club. We're a group.
We can take a vote on the issues.

182
00:15:38,544 --> 00:15:42,440
We can be a secret society that controls
the balance of power in the world.

183
00:15:42,513 --> 00:15:43,921
- Horton.
- And no one else can join,

184
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:46,158
unless they wear funny hats.

185
00:15:48,307 --> 00:15:49,966
Listen, Horton!

186
00:15:50,036 --> 00:15:52,458
The Chair recognizes Brother Morton.

187
00:15:52,564 --> 00:15:55,948
I am really happy you found
this speck and all,

188
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,785
but you might want to think
about keeping it to yourself.

189
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:02,677
What? Why?

190
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:07,153
Well, you're talking to a clover.
That doesn't look good.

191
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,504
You know what doesn't look good?

192
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,677
You talking about the speck
like the speck isn't even there.

193
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:17,595
The speck never said anything bad
about you.

194
00:16:17,693 --> 00:16:20,628
But, hey! Good luck
with your illusion of superiority.

195
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:25,078
You know, the speck can think anything
it wants about me. It's a speck.

196
00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:28,221
I see what's going on here.

197
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,736
Morton, no matter how tight
the speck and I get,

198
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:35,578
the speck could never replace you.

199
00:16:35,906 --> 00:16:39,006
I'm only sad that I would have
to explain that, at this point.

200
00:16:39,107 --> 00:16:42,687
Well, that's awesome, Horton.
That really helps.

201
00:16:43,109 --> 00:16:46,012
Just try to keep this to yourself.

202
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,416
I'll see you later. Try.

203
00:16:53,768 --> 00:16:55,656
Hey, Horton! What you got there?

204
00:16:55,753 --> 00:16:57,215
What? Nothing!

205
00:16:57,609 --> 00:16:59,650
We're not doing anything.

206
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,888
- We're totally alone.
- Who's "we"?

207
00:17:02,987 --> 00:17:05,257
"We"? What? "We"? Did I say that?
I just... Oh.

208
00:17:05,356 --> 00:17:06,982
No, I would never say that,
because that would imply that

209
00:17:07,052 --> 00:17:09,508
I was with someone, and not alone.

210
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,184
Okay, seriously, you can't tell anybody.
I mean it.

211
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:22,031
If anybody finds out about this,
it could be very, very bad.

212
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:24,556
I'm not sure why.

213
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:26,608
We won't tell anyone.

214
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:30,221
And if we do,
we'll tell them not to tell anyone.

215
00:17:30,836 --> 00:17:32,047
Perfect!

216
00:17:32,308 --> 00:17:33,737
Okay, I'm taking a bath, right,

217
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,820
'cause my skin gets kind of dry
and a little bit ashy.

218
00:17:35,925 --> 00:17:38,544
<i>While Horton came clean about</i>
<i>the speck that he'd found</i>

219
00:17:38,646 --> 00:17:40,752
<i>and how he had saved it</i>
<i>when it nearly drowned,</i>

220
00:17:40,855 --> 00:17:42,546
<i>the Mayor set off on his morning commute</i>

221
00:17:42,648 --> 00:17:45,747
<i>and noticed things weren't quite</i>
<i>the same on his route.</i>

222
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:50,073
<i>But please don't blame Horton, for he</i>
<i>didn't know that a small bump above...</i>

223
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,080
...and I dove in the water like this!

224
00:17:53,595 --> 00:17:55,668
<i>... was a big bump below.</i>

225
00:17:57,532 --> 00:17:59,256
Hey, Joe, don't work too hard.

226
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:02,457
These luxury condos,
they don't build themselves.

227
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:09,276
Hey, look at that!
I guess they do build themselves.

228
00:18:09,376 --> 00:18:11,678
Okay, that happened.

229
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:18,392
<i>Now, the Mayor knew it was his job</i>
<i>to convey the unusual things</i>

230
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:21,883
<i>that he'd noticed that day,</i>
<i>but there was one problem.</i>

231
00:18:21,988 --> 00:18:23,744
<i>Though his will was strong...</i>

232
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,668
- You're late.
- Thank you, Miss Yelp.

233
00:18:25,926 --> 00:18:29,123
<i>... nothing in Whoville</i>
<i>had ever gone wrong.</i>

234
00:18:29,222 --> 00:18:32,419
We have all that we need.
We need all that we've got.

235
00:18:32,488 --> 00:18:36,482
We like it in Whoville. We like it a lot!

236
00:18:36,585 --> 00:18:40,296
We're all very busy with
the Who-Centennial coming up,

237
00:18:40,394 --> 00:18:42,980
so let's bring this meeting to order.

238
00:18:43,435 --> 00:18:47,048
Mr. Mayor, I presume you
have some good news for us.

239
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,891
Well, it's news.

240
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:54,341
I don't know if we need to go labeling it
"good" or "bad" or anything like that.

241
00:18:54,414 --> 00:18:59,435
The thing is, I have noticed
some odd goings-on in Whoville lately.

242
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:01,228
Good "odd goings-on"?

243
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,067
Well, you know, tremors,
clouds swirling in the sky.

244
00:19:05,138 --> 00:19:06,862
And it seems to me, just to be safe,

245
00:19:06,963 --> 00:19:09,746
we might want to consider
postponing the Who-Centennial.

246
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:11,306
Consider what?

247
00:19:11,828 --> 00:19:13,104
Postponing the Who-Centennial.

248
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:16,306
What? Speak up, man!

249
00:19:17,526 --> 00:19:20,342
Postponing the Who-Centennial! All right?

250
00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:44,956
We are about to celebrate 100 years
of Whoville happiness and harmony,

251
00:19:45,055 --> 00:19:47,160
and you want to postpone the celebration?

252
00:19:47,231 --> 00:19:48,759
Well, what if Whoville's not safe?

253
00:19:48,831 --> 00:19:51,702
Nothing ever goes wrong in Whoville,

254
00:19:51,808 --> 00:19:56,120
never has and never will,
you blathering boob!

255
00:20:01,155 --> 00:20:04,353
The Who-Centennial will proceed
as planned!

256
00:20:04,901 --> 00:20:07,552
The Mayor was merely being an idiot.

257
00:20:07,654 --> 00:20:10,589
It will be all smiles from now on.

258
00:20:14,216 --> 00:20:15,198
That hurt!

259
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,492
Girl, I got 15,000 friends already.

260
00:20:19,561 --> 00:20:21,384
What? What do you mean,
it don't look like me?

261
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:25,892
That looks just like me 10 years ago.
Wait a minute. Hold on for a second.

262
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:32,932
Treats me like an idiot. I am not an idiot.

263
00:20:35,215 --> 00:20:37,158
Do I look like an idiot?

264
00:20:38,128 --> 00:20:41,544
- You don't want me to answer that.
- I am not an idiot.

265
00:20:42,096 --> 00:20:45,610
Has the nerve to call me a boob?
I would never call somebody a boob.

266
00:20:45,714 --> 00:20:47,689
He's a boob! Look at you.

267
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:49,387
Yuck!

268
00:20:49,747 --> 00:20:51,406
Look at your face.

269
00:20:51,732 --> 00:20:55,563
And I bet you don't look so good
with a stapler in your head!

270
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:06,999
Whoa! Whoa.

271
00:21:10,522 --> 00:21:13,173
- Thank you, Miss Yelp.
- You're welcome.

272
00:21:14,715 --> 00:21:15,730
Hello?

273
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:19,480
Who said that? Back off! I'll punch you!

274
00:21:28,832 --> 00:21:29,879
Hello?

275
00:21:32,961 --> 00:21:34,074
Hello.

276
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,434
<i>Who's there?</i>

277
00:21:43,012 --> 00:21:43,994
This is the Mayor.

278
00:21:44,676 --> 00:21:46,717
The Mayor? The Mayor!

279
00:21:47,493 --> 00:21:49,534
I'm talking to the Mayor!

280
00:21:51,175 --> 00:21:54,591
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.
I knew there was life on this speck.

281
00:21:54,888 --> 00:21:56,830
"This speck"? What speck?

282
00:21:57,321 --> 00:22:01,478
Well, I don't exactly know
how to tell you this, but...

283
00:22:02,506 --> 00:22:04,896
<i>You're living on a speck.</i>

284
00:22:04,971 --> 00:22:09,413
Well, I hate to disagree with you,
O voice from the drainpipe,

285
00:22:09,484 --> 00:22:11,394
but I live in Whoville.

286
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,895
Well, then, Whoville's a speck.

287
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:14,981
<i>Right.</i>

288
00:22:15,054 --> 00:22:17,772
Okay, seriously, who is this?

289
00:22:18,351 --> 00:22:19,628
Is this Burt from accounting?

290
00:22:20,688 --> 00:22:23,504
No. This is Horton. I'm an elephant.

291
00:22:23,697 --> 00:22:26,764
Okay, "Horton."

292
00:22:26,866 --> 00:22:29,070
Fake name. Where are you?

293
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:34,258
<i>Well, from where you're standing,</i>
<i>I guess I'm in the sky.</i>

294
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,337
Compared to you, I'm enormous.

295
00:22:36,437 --> 00:22:38,893
Which is saying something,
because I've slimmed down quite a bit.

296
00:22:38,998 --> 00:22:40,176
I swim.

297
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:44,755
Your whole world fits on a flower
in my world.

298
00:22:45,016 --> 00:22:47,667
Oh, man, this is even pushing it
for you, Burt.

299
00:22:47,896 --> 00:22:50,745
Don't believe me? Watch what happens
when I put you in the shade.

300
00:22:50,842 --> 00:22:52,981
This is absolutely impossible...

301
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,196
<i>Dark.</i>

302
00:22:55,163 --> 00:22:56,178
Light.

303
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:57,781
<i>Dark.</i>

304
00:22:58,301 --> 00:23:01,618
Light. Dark, light, dark, light,
dark, light, dark.

305
00:23:02,717 --> 00:23:03,895
<i>Light!</i>

306
00:23:04,702 --> 00:23:05,750
Don't you see?

307
00:23:06,431 --> 00:23:10,393
<i>We're in the middle of some kind of</i>
<i>amazing cosmic convergence.</i>

308
00:23:11,008 --> 00:23:15,068
<i>Two vastly different worlds,</i>
<i>miraculously crossing paths!</i>

309
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,752
Mine, colossal! Yours, miniscule.

310
00:23:17,826 --> 00:23:20,510
Yet somehow we've managed
to make contact.

311
00:23:20,707 --> 00:23:23,577
<i>If you think about it, it's pretty amazing.</i>

312
00:23:27,045 --> 00:23:28,355
Is everything okay down there?

313
00:23:30,726 --> 00:23:34,622
I don't know. You tell me.
You're the one holding the speck.

314
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,797
I'm the one holding the speck.

315
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:39,678
I'm the one holding the speck.

316
00:23:40,234 --> 00:23:42,307
<i>Don't you worry, Mr. Mayor.</i>

317
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:45,033
Hold, please!

318
00:23:47,564 --> 00:23:50,565
<i>What did all of this mean?</i>
<i>The Mayor hadn't a clue.</i>

319
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:55,821
<i>So he ran to the office of Dr. Larue,</i>
<i>the brainiest brain on the staff at Who U.</i>

320
00:23:55,886 --> 00:23:57,163
Dr. Larue!

321
00:23:58,927 --> 00:24:00,651
This is crazy.

322
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,215
Mr. Mayor.

323
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,002
How may I be of assistance?

324
00:24:05,106 --> 00:24:07,495
I don't know. Hey, you know,
I was just wondering

325
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:12,143
if our world were, say, a tiny speck
floating through space,

326
00:24:12,212 --> 00:24:13,194
how would we know?

327
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,959
Well, why would you ask
something like that?

328
00:24:15,061 --> 00:24:18,128
No reason. No reason at all.
I don't even remember.

329
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,205
Yes, I do. You know what?

330
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,166
Some guy was talking to me.

331
00:24:22,263 --> 00:24:24,947
Not an elephant in the sky.
A guy on the ground.

332
00:24:25,016 --> 00:24:27,286
There would be several ramifications.

333
00:24:27,385 --> 00:24:29,141
Good ramifications?

334
00:24:29,945 --> 00:24:31,440
A tiny speck?

335
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:33,972
Yeah. Tiny speck.

336
00:24:34,075 --> 00:24:35,701
Floating around.

337
00:24:36,571 --> 00:24:41,843
Well, we'd have inexplicable tremors,
dramatic changes in the weather,

338
00:24:42,493 --> 00:24:46,171
and if we didn't eventually achieve
some sort of stability,

339
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:49,620
our world would be destroyed!

340
00:24:50,144 --> 00:24:53,342
Destroyed? Destroyed. Oh, destroyed.

341
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,060
Horton!

342
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:02,595
<i>No, this is Benny.</i>

343
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,667
Horton is busy right now.

344
00:25:06,181 --> 00:25:07,588
No. I'm joking.

345
00:25:07,845 --> 00:25:09,122
<i>That's me.</i>

346
00:25:09,798 --> 00:25:11,206
We're doomed.

347
00:25:11,271 --> 00:25:15,233
Listen, Horton, turns out
I need your help a little bit.

348
00:25:15,304 --> 00:25:17,509
Apparently, if that speck
keeps moving around,

349
00:25:17,608 --> 00:25:20,195
our whole world could be obliterated.

350
00:25:20,681 --> 00:25:25,669
So I need you to find us Whos
a safer, more stable home,

351
00:25:25,771 --> 00:25:26,786
and fast.

352
00:25:27,307 --> 00:25:29,861
No problem, Mr. Mayor. Let's see...

353
00:25:32,173 --> 00:25:34,727
Wow, that's a nice view.

354
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:39,142
Hello. Is everything okay?

355
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:49,641
What's going on up there?

356
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,863
This entire jungle is a house of death!

357
00:26:07,736 --> 00:26:09,973
Oh, wait. There's a good spot.

358
00:26:10,298 --> 00:26:13,430
<i>And it's then Horton saw</i>
<i>at the top of Mount Nool,</i>

359
00:26:13,498 --> 00:26:16,630
<i>a small cave that looked peaceful</i>
<i>and quiet and cool,</i>

360
00:26:16,699 --> 00:26:19,667
<i>where a sunflower grew proud and tall</i>
<i>from the ground.</i>

361
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,735
<i>There, he knew every Who would be safe,</i>
<i>would be sound.</i>

362
00:26:23,838 --> 00:26:27,068
I found it, Mayor. The perfect place.

363
00:26:27,999 --> 00:26:29,177
Right up there,

364
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:32,410
<i>- on the top of Mount Nool.</i>
- Mr. Mayor?

365
00:26:32,641 --> 00:26:34,332
<i>I wish you could...</i>

366
00:26:35,105 --> 00:26:36,218
Shiny.

367
00:26:37,955 --> 00:26:40,060
The Who-Centennial Committee
is waiting for you

368
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:43,197
to look over the giant meatball
for the Edible Parade.

369
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:45,985
And then you're due at the dentist
for your Who-root canal.

370
00:26:46,085 --> 00:26:50,112
You know, sticking "Who" in front
of everything doesn't make it hurt less.

371
00:26:50,182 --> 00:26:52,038
Just wastes time!

372
00:26:52,103 --> 00:26:53,860
I don't want to go.

373
00:26:55,751 --> 00:26:56,864
Listen, Horton, I've gotta go.

374
00:26:56,968 --> 00:26:59,074
Apparently, there's a problem
with the giant meatball.

375
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:04,705
You just take care of that meatball, sir,
and leave the freaking out to me.

376
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:07,594
<i>So then Horton began</i>
<i>his long, perilous trek,</i>

377
00:27:07,691 --> 00:27:10,824
<i>determined to save the small world</i>
<i>on the speck.</i>

378
00:27:11,725 --> 00:27:14,180
<i>Horton was faithful and stalwart and kind.</i>

379
00:27:14,286 --> 00:27:15,693
I got you.

380
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,614
<i>He was a brave hero...</i>

381
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,662
I'll protect you!

382
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:20,077
<i>... at least in his mind.</i>

383
00:27:20,175 --> 00:27:22,664
We must become invisible. Travel silently.

384
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:25,486
For there are forces
that would seek to destroy us.

385
00:27:31,732 --> 00:27:34,515
So you think you can sneak up
on me, huh?

386
00:27:36,213 --> 00:27:39,443
It is clear that you are no match
for my technique.

387
00:27:41,654 --> 00:27:45,998
I see you have mastered the way of the
snapping branch. Watch me tumble!

388
00:27:47,576 --> 00:27:48,886
Morton Mouse, go!

389
00:27:48,985 --> 00:27:51,800
You are fast, Horton,
but the Kangaroo has monkeys.

390
00:27:51,898 --> 00:27:55,544
I will make monkeys of these monkeys.
It is their destiny.

391
00:27:55,739 --> 00:27:57,169
More clover!

392
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,682
Horton is the greatest hero of them all!

393
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:02,804
- Horton!
- Morton!

394
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:03,892
Go!

395
00:28:06,174 --> 00:28:08,346
But Mount Nool is that way.

396
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:12,573
To the top of Mount Nool!
As fast as lightning! Away, I go.

397
00:28:14,785 --> 00:28:16,542
Sorry, little fellow.

398
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:20,061
You'll be fine. Just think healing thoughts.

399
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,436
- Horton! Look!
- Horton! Look, look, look!

400
00:28:27,782 --> 00:28:30,335
We've all got our own clovers
with worlds on them!

401
00:28:30,438 --> 00:28:31,583
Yeah.

402
00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:36,128
In my world, everyone's a pony,

403
00:28:36,231 --> 00:28:39,331
and they all eat rainbows
and poop butterflies.

404
00:28:41,097 --> 00:28:43,237
That's beautiful, Katie.

405
00:28:47,275 --> 00:28:49,218
In a really weird way.

406
00:28:49,324 --> 00:28:52,074
My world is called Jessica-land,
and everyone worships Queen Jessica

407
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:53,833
because Jessica is so beautiful.

408
00:28:53,902 --> 00:28:56,619
Jessica, that was awesome.

409
00:29:01,424 --> 00:29:02,602
- Rudy!
- Mom, be careful!

410
00:29:02,672 --> 00:29:03,982
My best friend Thidwick lives on that.

411
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,944
Rudy, no one lives on this.
It's not possible.

412
00:29:08,306 --> 00:29:09,965
That Horton is a menace.

413
00:29:10,035 --> 00:29:12,141
Mom, Mom! Please, you're so weird.
Don't do this to me.

414
00:29:12,243 --> 00:29:13,705
Honey, go to your room.

415
00:29:13,812 --> 00:29:15,023
Horton!

416
00:29:18,037 --> 00:29:19,663
It's good!

417
00:29:19,766 --> 00:29:21,522
What do you think you're doing?

418
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,085
You guys with worlds are in trouble!

419
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:27,186
- Have you forgotten what we discussed?
- Oh, no. I'm an elephant,

420
00:29:27,288 --> 00:29:29,525
and elephants never forget.
It's a curse, really.

421
00:29:29,593 --> 00:29:31,416
I remember I was on my head,
and you said "Humpf,"

422
00:29:31,481 --> 00:29:33,042
and I looked up, and you said,
"What are you doing?"

423
00:29:33,114 --> 00:29:34,325
And I said the thing about the speck.

424
00:29:34,395 --> 00:29:36,403
Then you pulled my ears
and you poked me in the forehead...

425
00:29:36,476 --> 00:29:38,386
- Horton!
- Well, you did.

426
00:29:38,492 --> 00:29:41,428
Give me that clover, Horton. Now!

427
00:29:42,845 --> 00:29:43,925
No.

428
00:29:47,294 --> 00:29:48,374
No?

429
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:50,778
Yeah.

430
00:29:50,848 --> 00:29:53,915
Are you sure you want to fight
this fight, Horton?

431
00:29:54,016 --> 00:29:58,491
Because I promise you
it will get very ugly, very fast.

432
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,898
And you need to ask yourself,

433
00:30:00,963 --> 00:30:04,259
"Do I really want
to put myself through all this?

434
00:30:04,324 --> 00:30:06,300
"For a clover?"

435
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:08,162
Take it from me, Horton.

436
00:30:08,262 --> 00:30:09,604
You don't.

437
00:30:09,989 --> 00:30:11,615
So hand it over!

438
00:30:14,663 --> 00:30:16,736
No! I can't give it to you.

439
00:30:17,672 --> 00:30:19,265
There are people on this speck.

440
00:30:19,336 --> 00:30:21,028
Granted, they're very small people,

441
00:30:21,098 --> 00:30:23,848
but a person's a person,
no matter how small.

442
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:32,901
You just crossed the line, Horton,
and I'm gonna make you pay.

443
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:40,712
That Horton is a menace.

444
00:30:40,783 --> 00:30:43,435
He has those kids using
their imaginations.

445
00:30:43,504 --> 00:30:44,333
It's sick.

446
00:30:44,753 --> 00:30:48,911
All right, I gotta get this speck
up to the top of Mount Nool, ASAP,

447
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:53,518
whatever that means. Probably,
"Act Swiftly, Awesome Pachyderm."

448
00:30:53,588 --> 00:30:55,760
I mean, how hard can that be?

449
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:04,781
It's just a straight plummet
to certain death.

450
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,525
This looks kind of precarious.

451
00:31:10,489 --> 00:31:12,594
Well, no need to worry.

452
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,767
Obviously, when they build a bridge
like this,

453
00:31:14,842 --> 00:31:18,553
they take into account
that elephants will be crossing here.

454
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:24,120
All right. Feels good.
I'll just get the feel of it!

455
00:31:42,947 --> 00:31:44,377
That's true.

456
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,735
Oh, God.

457
00:31:52,806 --> 00:31:55,677
Hello. And how are we today, Mr. Mayor?

458
00:31:57,512 --> 00:31:59,105
Say, "Ah."

459
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,490
Rinse, please.

460
00:32:15,181 --> 00:32:18,794
I think a few of these boards could
stand to be replaced.

461
00:32:28,434 --> 00:32:31,915
I just need to think light.
I'm light as a feather.

462
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:34,737
I'm light as a feather!

463
00:32:41,622 --> 00:32:42,997
Heavy feather.

464
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:47,157
Okay, this will just pinch a little.

465
00:32:48,473 --> 00:32:52,118
I'm lighter than a feather.
What's lighter than a feather?

466
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:58,328
Air! There's nothing lighter.
So it stands to reason

467
00:33:00,092 --> 00:33:02,100
that the more air I have,

468
00:33:03,485 --> 00:33:06,967
the lighter I'll be.

469
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,475
Next, please.

470
00:33:49,964 --> 00:33:52,420
All right, that was absolutely terrifying.

471
00:33:52,493 --> 00:33:54,501
If I just pull myself up!

472
00:33:56,526 --> 00:33:58,730
Try not to panic.

473
00:34:17,877 --> 00:34:20,212
That could've been a disaster.

474
00:34:23,735 --> 00:34:28,013
Wow. I feel really good right now.
Maybe it's my new sense of purpose.

475
00:34:51,552 --> 00:34:52,861
All right.

476
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:57,473
Hey, JoJo! I need your help.
Can you help me?

477
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:01,368
Okay, great. Okay.
First, I need you to go to the girls' room.

478
00:35:01,763 --> 00:35:03,706
Take down Hanna's china doll collection
and then...

479
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:04,892
Stop looking at my arm.

480
00:35:04,964 --> 00:35:06,426
Put away Holly's light bulb collection,
and then...

481
00:35:06,532 --> 00:35:10,657
You know what? Just take care of
anything that might break or shatter.

482
00:35:11,366 --> 00:35:13,538
Okay, take a good long look.

483
00:35:13,798 --> 00:35:15,839
Got it? Thanks, JoJo!

484
00:35:25,867 --> 00:35:28,039
Here. And... Take that. And...

485
00:35:35,054 --> 00:35:36,843
Hi. You're home late.

486
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:42,383
Sorry, hon. I was just having some
dental work done on my arm.

487
00:35:42,448 --> 00:35:43,496
So, what was...

488
00:35:43,568 --> 00:35:44,681
Ned!

489
00:35:46,385 --> 00:35:48,109
What are you doing?

490
00:35:48,306 --> 00:35:49,615
What do you mean?

491
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:52,749
Well, I'm no detective, Ned,
but you are hanging from the chandelier.

492
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:53,866
I just thought it might look better

493
00:35:53,939 --> 00:35:57,169
somewhere it can't fall on us
and crush us in our sleep.

494
00:35:59,734 --> 00:36:01,425
What is going on?

495
00:36:04,471 --> 00:36:06,130
Hey, hon,

496
00:36:08,536 --> 00:36:12,214
did you ever get the feeling
that you were being watched?

497
00:36:13,593 --> 00:36:16,943
Yeah, sure. I suppose.

498
00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:21,079
And then you get the feeling that
maybe that thing watching you is

499
00:36:22,461 --> 00:36:24,152
a giant elephant?

500
00:36:24,989 --> 00:36:27,838
And you know how
you get that weird feeling

501
00:36:27,902 --> 00:36:30,772
that your world is actually a tiny speck?

502
00:36:30,879 --> 00:36:36,860
And that the elephant that I talked about
earlier is carrying it around on a flower.

503
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:41,021
And you realize that if you tell anybody,
they'd think you were crazy.

504
00:36:41,123 --> 00:36:45,597
But you still feel a responsibility
to keep everyone safe.

505
00:36:46,116 --> 00:36:48,004
You know that feeling?

506
00:36:48,997 --> 00:36:51,681
You know, I'm gonna have to say no.

507
00:36:51,749 --> 00:36:53,790
Do you know that feeling?

508
00:36:56,871 --> 00:36:57,952
No.

509
00:36:59,496 --> 00:37:03,753
Yawn. Wow. I am beat.
Time to hit the hay, I guess.

510
00:37:04,042 --> 00:37:07,239
Sweetheart, I know
you're under a lot of stress,

511
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:12,003
and if you're seeing elephants
and flowers, then fine.

512
00:37:12,076 --> 00:37:15,044
Just don't tell anyone else
that story, okay?

513
00:37:15,117 --> 00:37:17,988
And remember,
it's not the end of the world.

514
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,996
"The end of the world."

515
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,088
Horton to Mayor. Horton to Mayor.
Come in, Mayor. Over.

516
00:37:28,338 --> 00:37:29,516
Horton?

517
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:32,783
I get terrible reception here.

518
00:37:32,979 --> 00:37:36,625
How about this?
If I get up real close, can you read me?

519
00:37:39,701 --> 00:37:41,677
Yep! Roger that.

520
00:37:42,294 --> 00:37:43,854
Are we at that safe place yet?

521
00:37:44,087 --> 00:37:47,437
Almost. I'm pretty sure
the worst part's over.

522
00:37:47,544 --> 00:37:49,268
This is your elephant speaking.

523
00:37:49,336 --> 00:37:52,720
Just sit back, enjoy the ride, and
we'll have you to Mount Nool in no time.

524
00:37:52,825 --> 00:37:54,713
No, you can't have ice cream for breakfast.

525
00:37:54,778 --> 00:37:55,760
- Please.
- Please.

526
00:37:55,866 --> 00:37:57,012
Who's that?

527
00:37:57,115 --> 00:37:58,544
<i>Is there someone else there?</i>

528
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:00,725
Well, that's my wife and kids.

529
00:38:00,828 --> 00:38:02,290
You have a family.

530
00:38:02,589 --> 00:38:08,406
I do, indeed. A beautiful wife,
96 daughters, and one son.

531
00:38:08,671 --> 00:38:10,133
Oh, busy guy.

532
00:38:10,591 --> 00:38:12,981
And we all share one bathroom.
You know how that is.

533
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,415
Yeah. Don't I know it.

534
00:38:16,353 --> 00:38:17,630
Bathroom?

535
00:38:17,953 --> 00:38:19,132
- Ned!
- What?

536
00:38:19,234 --> 00:38:22,716
Sweetheart, you know
you're on the roof, right?

537
00:38:22,787 --> 00:38:23,834
- Please, Mom.
- What's that?

538
00:38:23,907 --> 00:38:26,177
No, you need to go to bed.
Daddy's having a breakdown.

539
00:38:26,276 --> 00:38:28,349
Ned, what are you up to now?

540
00:38:28,421 --> 00:38:31,618
I was just about to put the kids to bed
when I got off the roof.

541
00:38:31,718 --> 00:38:34,436
And that's what happened. Right.

542
00:38:50,252 --> 00:38:52,075
- Daddy?
- Yes.

543
00:38:52,172 --> 00:38:54,759
- Can I have a glass of water?
- Of course.

544
00:38:54,829 --> 00:38:56,356
- Me, too.
- Me, three.

545
00:38:58,991 --> 00:39:00,038
Me, 28.

546
00:39:00,111 --> 00:39:01,224
Okay.

547
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:07,790
Hey, JoJo!

548
00:39:08,977 --> 00:39:12,907
A lot of liquid. A lot of liquid.
Just the person I wanted to see.

549
00:39:13,011 --> 00:39:17,682
Yeah, I realize that we have not
been seeing eye-to-eye lately,

550
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,636
and most of it is my fault.

551
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:20,716
It's true.

552
00:39:20,821 --> 00:39:22,513
You know what I've been trying to do?

553
00:39:22,614 --> 00:39:26,478
I have been trying to impose
my vision of your future on you.

554
00:39:27,096 --> 00:39:29,365
Let me make this perfectly clear.

555
00:39:29,464 --> 00:39:33,808
JoJo, you can be whatever
kind of Mayor you want to be.

556
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:37,460
Hands-on, strong and silent,
outspoken, it's up to you.

557
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:40,531
Well, good. I feel so much better.

558
00:39:40,636 --> 00:39:44,466
I am expecting big things from you,
young man. Big things.

559
00:39:44,541 --> 00:39:46,298
All right. Good night.

560
00:39:46,398 --> 00:39:48,253
Good stuff. Good talk.

561
00:40:02,242 --> 00:40:05,472
<i>Then JoJo snuck out,</i>
<i>feeling lonely and sad,</i>

562
00:40:05,539 --> 00:40:08,323
<i>and tragically misunderstood by his dad.</i>

563
00:40:23,914 --> 00:40:26,762
<i>And where was he going</i>
<i>at such a late hour?</i>

564
00:40:29,131 --> 00:40:32,198
<i>Up to Whoville's abandoned</i>
<i>Star-Studying Tower,</i>

565
00:40:33,549 --> 00:40:36,681
<i>a place where the boy felt contented, free.</i>

566
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:39,598
<i>A place he could be what he wanted to be.</i>

567
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:44,651
<i>And what was inside there,</i>
<i>I'd say if I could.</i>

568
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,267
<i>But up above, the Kangaroo</i>
<i>was up to no good.</i>

569
00:40:55,956 --> 00:40:57,004
Can I come out now, Mom?

570
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,589
No, Rudy.
Stay in the room.

571
00:40:59,589 --> 00:41:01,934
- But, Mom?
- Stay inside.

572
00:41:12,748 --> 00:41:14,886
Mr. Vladicoff

573
00:41:26,835 --> 00:41:28,595
Eating, go.

574
00:41:28,595 --> 00:41:30,440
Yes. I - I realize you're busy,

575
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,725
but I need your help.

576
00:41:32,876 --> 00:41:33,997
It's Horton.

577
00:41:34,265 --> 00:41:36,820
He's become obsessed with a clover.

578
00:41:36,823 --> 00:41:40,357
And he get actually thinks
there are little people on it.

579
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:44,583
I want that clover destroyed.

580
00:41:44,692 --> 00:41:46,676
Sure, what a good deal this is,

581
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,048
for you, bro.

582
00:41:49,143 --> 00:41:51,842
I'd do it myself,
but being a lady,

583
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,162
I prefer not to get my hands dirty.

584
00:41:54,661 --> 00:41:57,308
But I hear you have no problem with that.

585
00:41:58,732 --> 00:41:59,522
No.

586
00:42:00,285 --> 00:42:01,558
No problem.

587
00:42:01,735 --> 00:42:03,135
Easy peasy.

588
00:42:03,334 --> 00:42:04,252
But...

589
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:06,694
I would only do this for a price.

590
00:42:06,835 --> 00:42:09,568
In exchange for a practical payment.

591
00:42:10,224 --> 00:42:11,210
No.

592
00:42:12,078 --> 00:42:13,515
- This...

593
00:42:13,743 --> 00:42:15,867
- little kangaroo.
- Mom?!

594
00:42:16,007 --> 00:42:16,954
Quiet, Rudy.

595
00:42:17,055 --> 00:42:18,929
Mommy is thinking it over.

596
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:23,478
We'll thanks but, on second thought

597
00:42:23,478 --> 00:42:26,473
I think I'm going to have
the Wickersham Brothers

598
00:42:26,474 --> 00:42:27,910
take care of this for me.

599
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:30,994
Of course, the Wickersham Brothers.
I mean they're a quasi operation.

600
00:42:30,994 --> 00:42:32,334
You know, they'd...
Wait! No!

601
00:42:32,334 --> 00:42:33,874
You can't go to Wickersham.

602
00:42:33,874 --> 00:42:37,786
No. No. No no no, the Wickershams
would be perfect for this job.

603
00:42:37,949 --> 00:42:41,365
But, they are monkeys,
that's not scary.

604
00:42:41,365 --> 00:42:45,175
Ah, thanks anyway,
maybe next time.

605
00:42:45,175 --> 00:42:46,039
Wait!

606
00:42:46,785 --> 00:42:49,528
Here is what I will do
to the precious clover.

607
00:42:49,758 --> 00:42:50,990
I will take it,

608
00:42:51,262 --> 00:42:52,347
I will crush it,

609
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:55,990
I will devour it.

610
00:43:02,691 --> 00:43:04,932
Bigger than it looked.
One second.

611
00:43:07,307 --> 00:43:08,557
Holy Moly.

612
00:43:14,275 --> 00:43:15,759
Then, I will regurgitate it.

613
00:43:15,804 --> 00:43:16,687
Then...

614
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:19,621
I can I devour it
second time.

615
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:21,797
So two times devour.

616
00:43:22,302 --> 00:43:23,795
Sounds nice.

617
00:43:24,407 --> 00:43:26,548
But I think I'll talk to the Wickershams.

618
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:27,403
Wait.

619
00:43:28,805 --> 00:43:30,336
Here is best part.

620
00:43:30,718 --> 00:43:32,523
I do all that...

621
00:43:33,372 --> 00:43:35,055
gratis.

622
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,221
That's free bro.

623
00:43:38,177 --> 00:43:39,225
What do you think?

624
00:43:42,684 --> 00:43:46,106
- Deal.
- Yes. Score. Thanking you.

625
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:47,505
You won't regret.

626
00:44:21,972 --> 00:44:22,775
Mayor?

627
00:44:23,406 --> 00:44:24,355
Mayor?

628
00:44:24,814 --> 00:44:26,556
Open up, Mr. Mayor!

629
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:28,121
Mr. Mayor!

630
00:44:29,246 --> 00:44:32,210
It's snowing in the summer!

631
00:44:36,951 --> 00:44:37,755
Yes.

632
00:44:38,017 --> 00:44:39,167
Yes, it is.

633
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:41,178
It's a dramatic change in the weather.

634
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,835
As if we're on a speck floating in space.

635
00:44:43,835 --> 00:44:47,274
I don't know how you knew,
but somehow, you did.

636
00:44:47,422 --> 00:44:52,576
And Whoville is headed for... disaster.

637
00:44:52,784 --> 00:44:55,228
- Oh, Horton.
- What?

638
00:44:55,482 --> 00:44:57,463
Ah, nothing. I'm on it.

639
00:44:57,463 --> 00:45:00,122
It's up to us to save
the people of Whoville.

640
00:45:04,277 --> 00:45:05,761
Snow is not lucky.

641
00:45:07,846 --> 00:45:08,757
That's not... Stop.

642
00:45:10,743 --> 00:45:12,479
O.K.
Anybody else?

643
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:13,748
Good.

644
00:45:15,743 --> 00:45:17,916
No no. Don't join in.
This is not fun.

645
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:19,450
Uh, this is a sign of doom.

646
00:45:21,612 --> 00:45:24,263
Oh, sweety, that's...
No. No no no.

647
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,425
It's dangerous.

648
00:45:27,728 --> 00:45:30,455
Stop having fun immediately!

649
00:45:30,455 --> 00:45:31,703
This is dangerous!

650
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:33,035
O.K.

651
00:45:43,803 --> 00:45:44,468
Horton?

652
00:45:44,618 --> 00:45:45,731
Uh? What?

653
00:45:52,927 --> 00:45:54,083
Hey, there.

654
00:45:55,155 --> 00:45:56,373
We're in big trouble down here.

655
00:45:56,373 --> 00:45:59,204
It's happening.
It's snowing in the middle of summer.

656
00:45:59,662 --> 00:46:01,123
It's the end of the world!

657
00:46:04,494 --> 00:46:07,789
Hold on, Mayor.
I think I know what your problem is.

658
00:46:18,252 --> 00:46:19,975
<i>There. That better?</i>

659
00:46:22,124 --> 00:46:24,164
That seems to have worked.

660
00:46:25,708 --> 00:46:26,690
Do I smell peanuts?

661
00:46:26,764 --> 00:46:30,538
Yeah, they're my favorite snack,
but they tend to linger.

662
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,122
Finwick, no!

663
00:46:38,699 --> 00:46:41,568
Hang on, Mr. Mayor.
I may have to put up a fight.

664
00:46:41,642 --> 00:46:43,846
A frightened elephant can be
very dangerous!

665
00:46:43,946 --> 00:46:47,623
All right!
You've called down the thunder, buddy!

666
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:52,097
You hungry for trouble? I'm an
"All you can eat" salad bar! Take a bite!

667
00:46:55,305 --> 00:46:56,483
I hate running.

668
00:46:56,585 --> 00:46:57,894
Morton!

669
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,164
Don't do that.

670
00:47:00,265 --> 00:47:01,442
Horton!

671
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,898
Horton! There you are!

672
00:47:04,968 --> 00:47:07,390
We got trouble! Wait, stay, wait!
Did you hear that?

673
00:47:07,496 --> 00:47:12,482
No, I'm here, okay. Listen. No! Go!
Kangaroo has gone nuts, bananas.

674
00:47:12,584 --> 00:47:15,300
She's telling everyone that
you should be kicked out of Nool.

675
00:47:15,367 --> 00:47:18,018
She said that?
I thought we were her friends.

676
00:47:18,087 --> 00:47:20,127
Word is she's gone to Vlad!

677
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:23,395
Vlad? Vlad? I know two Vlads.

678
00:47:23,494 --> 00:47:27,324
Is it the bad Vlad
or the bunny Vlad that makes the cookies?

679
00:47:27,398 --> 00:47:30,813
Yeah, Horton, she's sending you
a bunny with cookies.

680
00:47:30,886 --> 00:47:33,701
I think we can assume it's the bad Vlad.

681
00:47:33,926 --> 00:47:35,170
Yeah, that's a good call.

682
00:47:35,238 --> 00:47:40,126
So unless you're cool
with giant, razor-sharp claws

683
00:47:40,197 --> 00:47:43,774
ripping the flesh off your body,
I'd get rid of the clover!

684
00:47:43,844 --> 00:47:46,714
I can't! I promised the Mayor.

685
00:47:47,236 --> 00:47:49,603
I meant what I said,
and I said what I meant,

686
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,155
and an elephant's faithful, 100%.

687
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:57,246
Please. For me, just this once.
Be faithful 99% of the time.

688
00:47:57,316 --> 00:48:01,571
I've never gotten 99% on anything,
and I think I'm awesome! So, come on!

689
00:48:01,635 --> 00:48:05,246
I meant what I said,
and I said what I meant.

690
00:48:05,795 --> 00:48:07,834
I'm not gonna say it.

691
00:48:07,938 --> 00:48:10,807
You can do that all day,
it's not happening.

692
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:12,735
An elephant's faithful, 100%.

693
00:48:12,802 --> 00:48:17,274
That's right. That's my code, my motto.
But thanks for the warning.

694
00:48:17,697 --> 00:48:19,552
Motto. Okay.

695
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:21,438
But watch the skies.

696
00:48:21,537 --> 00:48:24,603
Keep watching the skies!

697
00:48:28,993 --> 00:48:31,131
Mayor, you need to get
everyone underground.

698
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,182
Now!

699
00:48:33,056 --> 00:48:34,714
<i>I don't want to sound the alarm,</i>

700
00:48:34,816 --> 00:48:36,757
<i>but there's a good possibility</i>
<i>we may be attacked</i>

701
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:39,678
- by a giant carnivorous bird.
<i>- What?</i>

702
00:48:39,775 --> 00:48:42,971
There's a small chance it could be a bunny
with cookies, but I wouldn't count on it.

703
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,429
They are formidable.

704
00:48:46,527 --> 00:48:48,436
<i>Mayor? Are you there?</i>

705
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:51,764
Yeah. No. That's a great idea. It's just...

706
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:55,864
In order to get everyone mobilized,
I'd need the okay of the City Council,

707
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:58,421
and they never listen to me.

708
00:48:58,526 --> 00:49:00,467
I've been called a boob,

709
00:49:00,573 --> 00:49:02,395
several times. I can't do it!

710
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:05,208
You have to talk to them, Mayor!
Okay. Listen.

711
00:49:07,548 --> 00:49:08,977
Bad Vlad!

712
00:49:09,085 --> 00:49:10,328
Bad Vlad!

713
00:49:10,909 --> 00:49:12,435
Bad Vlad!

714
00:49:19,227 --> 00:49:21,616
That is definitely not a bunny.

715
00:49:29,115 --> 00:49:33,206
Lost him. Meant to lose him,
and I lost him. Good.

716
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:39,955
Is this tree for real? Come on!

717
00:49:40,026 --> 00:49:42,895
Hang on, Whoville!
This is gonna get rough!

718
00:49:53,465 --> 00:49:55,636
Now you're going to get it!

719
00:49:56,664 --> 00:49:58,573
Get ready for the best!

720
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:02,701
Leave me alone!

721
00:50:07,607 --> 00:50:08,884
Horton!

722
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:21,840
I just know he's gonna
jump out somewhere.

723
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:23,055
Hello.

724
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:44,082
Chess mate.

725
00:50:44,788 --> 00:50:47,057
Now it's time for me to take clover

726
00:50:47,156 --> 00:50:49,773
and crush all the little people on it,
who are saying...

727
00:50:49,907 --> 00:50:53,136
Sorry. This is where we get off.

728
00:50:56,499 --> 00:50:58,157
Right in the beak!

729
00:51:00,403 --> 00:51:03,020
Cool line. Usually I can't think
of those things till later.

730
00:51:03,697 --> 00:51:05,388
<i>- Mayor?</i>
- Horton.

731
00:51:05,777 --> 00:51:06,792
Are you okay?

732
00:51:12,913 --> 00:51:15,760
Well, more or less. What happened?
The bird?

733
00:51:16,176 --> 00:51:19,853
Yeah, it attacked me.
Mayor, your people are in danger.

734
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,174
You know what? I'm gonna do it.

735
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,411
I'm going to go out there
and tell them what is going on.

736
00:51:26,512 --> 00:51:28,584
Perfect. Now, quick. Get going.

737
00:51:34,351 --> 00:51:36,424
Hey! Mr. Mayor! Something's wrong!

738
00:51:36,495 --> 00:51:39,626
- My basement's in the attic.
- The Science Museum is history.

739
00:51:39,695 --> 00:51:43,371
- The lost and found is missing.
- What's going on, Mr. Mayor?

740
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:45,706
I'm declaring a state of emergency!

741
00:51:45,774 --> 00:51:48,644
Don't worry! Don't worry!

742
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:51,205
The Mayor is just being a moron.

743
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:54,538
No, wait! Whoville is in terrible danger!

744
00:51:54,637 --> 00:51:58,379
Everyone needs to get down to the
underground storage area immediately.

745
00:51:58,477 --> 00:52:00,299
Fine! Fine!

746
00:52:00,396 --> 00:52:02,884
Let's do this democratically.

747
00:52:03,757 --> 00:52:07,105
Who wants the joy and glory and festivity

748
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:10,725
of the Who-Centennial
to proceed as planned?

749
00:52:11,116 --> 00:52:12,871
Yeah!

750
00:52:13,356 --> 00:52:16,389
And who, like the Mayor,

751
00:52:16,459 --> 00:52:20,004
thinks it would be better
to spend the Who-Centennial

752
00:52:20,107 --> 00:52:23,335
in an underground storage area?

753
00:52:23,978 --> 00:52:25,407
Yeah!

754
00:52:26,954 --> 00:52:28,808
Wait! You've gotta listen to me!

755
00:52:28,906 --> 00:52:31,775
Our whole world could explode!

756
00:52:36,009 --> 00:52:37,983
Much more quickly!

757
00:52:38,569 --> 00:52:41,220
And our world wouldn't make that noise.

758
00:52:42,568 --> 00:52:45,383
The people have spoken, Mr. Mayor.

759
00:52:46,089 --> 00:52:49,601
You're finished. No one believes you.

760
00:52:49,704 --> 00:52:51,743
No one supports you.

761
00:52:53,448 --> 00:52:55,455
Horton believes me.

762
00:52:55,527 --> 00:52:56,738
Horton?

763
00:52:57,991 --> 00:52:59,747
Who's Horton?

764
00:53:00,007 --> 00:53:05,505
Horton is a giant elephant in the sky!

765
00:53:06,343 --> 00:53:07,324
Don't bother looking, he's invisible.

766
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:11,139
And he's the one risking his life
to get Whoville,

767
00:53:11,206 --> 00:53:15,745
which, by the way,
is a speck on a clover, to safety!

768
00:53:26,821 --> 00:53:28,228
I can prove it!

769
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:31,161
Horton's voice comes out of this horn.

770
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:36,570
Horton!

771
00:53:37,732 --> 00:53:40,863
I have all the Whos
gathered in town square!

772
00:53:40,931 --> 00:53:42,786
Let them know you're there!

773
00:53:43,746 --> 00:53:47,161
Gee. This is kind of
a high-pressure situation, then.

774
00:53:50,146 --> 00:53:52,732
Wow. I am really drawing a blank here.

775
00:53:52,802 --> 00:53:54,046
I know!

776
00:53:58,049 --> 00:53:59,259
Horton!

777
00:53:59,906 --> 00:54:01,760
Horton, we're waiting!

778
00:54:02,465 --> 00:54:04,636
Time to show everyone that you exist,

779
00:54:04,737 --> 00:54:08,860
and by extension, what a non-boob I am.

780
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,731
Wait!

781
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,534
Everyone, look at the wind.
What do you think that that means?

782
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,837
It means...

783
00:54:23,935 --> 00:54:26,553
It means, obviously...

784
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,392
Let the kite-flying race begin!

785
00:54:47,357 --> 00:54:49,723
What a burn on you, Horton!

786
00:55:44,855 --> 00:55:46,229
Brain freeze.

787
00:55:53,015 --> 00:55:56,789
Give me back my speck!

788
00:55:56,886 --> 00:55:58,609
Not this time, guy.

789
00:56:05,013 --> 00:56:10,315
I am so sorry that I let you down,
but this... This is bigger than me.

790
00:56:10,389 --> 00:56:13,422
Get the family together
and get somewhere safe.

791
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,720
I will! I believe you.

792
00:56:22,484 --> 00:56:24,721
I've got you now, elephant.

793
00:56:26,612 --> 00:56:27,953
No, no, no!

794
00:56:39,474 --> 00:56:40,619
Oh, no!

795
00:57:07,312 --> 00:57:08,424
Mayor?

796
00:57:09,104 --> 00:57:10,533
Anybody there?

797
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:12,840
Hello?

798
00:57:13,903 --> 00:57:15,114
Anyone?

799
00:57:15,919 --> 00:57:18,854
<i>But clover by clover by clover, he found</i>

800
00:57:18,959 --> 00:57:22,220
<i>that the one he sought for</i>
<i>was just not around.</i>

801
00:57:23,247 --> 00:57:24,359
Mayor?

802
00:57:26,382 --> 00:57:27,397
Hello?

803
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:30,917
<i>And by noon, poor Horton,</i>
<i>more dead than alive,</i>

804
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:35,114
<i>had picked, searched and piled up 9,005.</i>

805
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:37,354
Hello?

806
00:57:38,157 --> 00:57:39,913
Sorry to bother you,

807
00:57:40,109 --> 00:57:41,385
nobody.

808
00:57:44,748 --> 00:57:46,177
Knock, knock.

809
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:50,912
This is where you'd say, "Who's there?"

810
00:57:50,988 --> 00:57:54,054
if there were any Whos there.

811
00:57:55,627 --> 00:57:57,994
Get it? "Whos there."

812
00:58:02,059 --> 00:58:05,255
<i>All day he looked, looked on and on,</i>

813
00:58:06,474 --> 00:58:08,895
<i>until his hope was almost gone.</i>

814
00:58:09,354 --> 00:58:12,223
No, no, no! Please, no!

815
00:58:13,418 --> 00:58:15,011
This isn't fair!

816
00:58:19,305 --> 00:58:21,858
<i>But, wait, could this one be the one?</i>

817
00:58:21,961 --> 00:58:24,579
<i>Was all his searching finally done?</i>

818
00:58:24,681 --> 00:58:27,299
<i>Ah, yes, for this was the hour.</i>

819
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:30,499
<i>Horton had found them</i>
<i>on the three millionth flower.</i>

820
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,902
Mayor! Mayor!

821
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,788
I found you!

822
00:58:37,512 --> 00:58:38,788
Mayor?

823
00:58:39,144 --> 00:58:40,572
Are you there?

824
00:58:40,743 --> 00:58:41,953
Mayor?

825
00:58:45,799 --> 00:58:46,976
Mayor.

826
00:58:53,734 --> 00:58:55,556
<i>Mayor, are you there?</i>

827
00:58:58,469 --> 00:58:59,811
<i>Mayor!</i>

828
00:59:05,509 --> 00:59:06,524
<i>Mayor?</i>

829
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,333
Mayor?

830
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:15,427
Mayor!

831
00:59:23,107 --> 00:59:25,179
<i>No, this is Floyd.</i>

832
00:59:26,467 --> 00:59:28,223
<i>Can I take a message?</i>

833
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:34,937
Mayor! You're okay!

834
00:59:37,346 --> 00:59:40,193
Horton! Horton! Stop! Stop it!

835
00:59:43,649 --> 00:59:44,729
Sorry.

836
00:59:44,833 --> 00:59:48,411
<i>It must have been rough down there.</i>
<i>I can't believe I found you.</i>

837
00:59:48,512 --> 00:59:50,519
<i>You really had me worried.</i>

838
00:59:51,489 --> 00:59:53,725
Say! The Mayor was right!

839
00:59:53,824 --> 00:59:56,028
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

840
00:59:56,096 --> 00:59:59,063
Okay, I'm all right, and so are you.

841
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:06,326
Citizens of Whoville!

842
01:00:08,383 --> 01:00:12,408
I'd like you to meet our friend Horton.

843
01:00:16,414 --> 01:00:18,269
He's going to help us!

844
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:21,814
I've got this.

845
01:00:21,886 --> 01:00:24,057
This is the Chairman...

846
01:00:24,126 --> 01:00:25,173
<i>Idiot!</i>

847
01:00:25,245 --> 01:00:28,092
You're finished in this town!
Is that understood? Finished.

848
01:00:28,189 --> 01:00:29,683
You boob!

849
01:00:31,164 --> 01:00:33,019
I'm just joking.

850
01:00:37,404 --> 01:00:38,452
Good one.

851
01:00:38,524 --> 01:00:40,532
Horton, this is my wife Sally.

852
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:41,847
You exist!

853
01:00:41,948 --> 01:00:44,249
This means my husband isn't crazy.

854
01:00:44,347 --> 01:00:45,841
Hooray!

855
01:00:45,948 --> 01:00:50,006
And a few of my daughters,
Haley, Holly, Hooly, Hilda and Hedy.

856
01:00:50,107 --> 01:00:51,219
- Hi!
- Hi!

857
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:54,673
And here is Miss Yelp, my loyal assistant.

858
01:00:54,779 --> 01:00:57,299
- And here's Dr. Larue.
- You saved us!

859
01:00:57,371 --> 01:00:58,777
And Burt from accounting,

860
01:00:58,842 --> 01:01:01,460
<i>and Mrs. McGillicuddy, and Mr. Farfoogan</i>

861
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:03,384
from the Clugan Farfoogans,

862
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:05,140
and the old man in the bathtub.

863
01:01:05,209 --> 01:01:06,900
Let's not overwhelm the poor fellow.

864
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:08,660
<i>He's never gonna remember</i>
<i>all these names.</i>

865
01:01:08,729 --> 01:01:11,544
Well, I'll try my best.

866
01:01:12,441 --> 01:01:14,644
Sally, Chairman,

867
01:01:14,745 --> 01:01:16,850
Haley, Hooly, Holly, Hilda,
Hedy, Miss Yelp,

868
01:01:16,921 --> 01:01:19,735
Dr. Larue, Burt from accounting,
Mrs. McGillicuddy, Mr. Farfoogan

869
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:23,794
of the Clugan Farfoogans,
and wasn't there an old guy in a shower?

870
01:01:23,896 --> 01:01:25,140
<i>Bathtub.</i>

871
01:01:25,208 --> 01:01:27,215
- Yeah!
<i>- We're all here, Horton,</i>

872
01:01:27,928 --> 01:01:31,408
and we all believe in you.

873
01:01:32,183 --> 01:01:34,124
Wow. That's awesome.

874
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:36,916
And it's a responsibility
I do not take lightly.

875
01:01:37,015 --> 01:01:41,008
I promise you a future
that is safe, sound and stable.

876
01:01:41,078 --> 01:01:46,162
We will create a world where every Who
is endowed with three inalienable rights,

877
01:01:46,262 --> 01:01:47,789
to be determined at a later date.

878
01:01:49,173 --> 01:01:53,842
And we will put a speck on Mount Nool
before the end of this decade.

879
01:02:00,596 --> 01:02:03,443
This elephant is crazy! Oh, my goodness.

880
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:07,086
I gotta tell everybody.
I need to get to the Kangaroo.

881
01:02:07,603 --> 01:02:09,937
Wait till they find out about...

882
01:02:10,291 --> 01:02:13,607
You should have been seeing me.
I really let elephant have it.

883
01:02:13,683 --> 01:02:18,254
I chase him, I torment him, I break him
into million little elephant pieces.

884
01:02:18,803 --> 01:02:22,512
It was thing of beauty, really.
My best work. Classic Vlad.

885
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:23,690
And the clover?

886
01:02:23,763 --> 01:02:27,439
Clover is finished!
No way in million years Horton find it.

887
01:02:27,538 --> 01:02:31,116
Read my beak. Clover is gone forever.

888
01:02:36,401 --> 01:02:40,012
I just saw Horton,
and he is still talking to that clover!

889
01:02:43,856 --> 01:02:44,904
Idiot!

890
01:02:45,008 --> 01:02:49,514
Whoa! Come on, I'm your bro!
It's me you're talking to. We have history!

891
01:02:50,256 --> 01:02:53,190
Come on, let's not forget,
I did this for free!

892
01:02:54,128 --> 01:02:57,161
What is happening to the jungle of Nool?

893
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:00,745
There once was a time
when people were people

894
01:03:00,847 --> 01:03:02,756
and specks were specks.

895
01:03:03,534 --> 01:03:07,396
Well, I say, "If you can't see it,
hear it or feel it,

896
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:09,193
"it doesn't exist!"

897
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:12,845
Our way of life is under attack!

898
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:16,258
And who is leading that attack? Horton!

899
01:03:16,365 --> 01:03:18,885
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

900
01:03:18,957 --> 01:03:21,226
Wait a minute!
This is Horton we're talking about.

901
01:03:21,325 --> 01:03:24,172
You all know him, he wouldn't hurt a fly.

902
01:03:24,237 --> 01:03:28,328
Except for that fly city he sat on.
But he didn't do that on purpose.

903
01:03:28,396 --> 01:03:29,923
Shut up, mouse!

904
01:03:30,796 --> 01:03:34,473
That's weird. My brownies are burning.
I gotta go!

905
01:03:35,596 --> 01:03:40,833
Are we going to let troublemakers like
Horton poison the minds of our children?

906
01:03:40,907 --> 01:03:42,631
Not the children!

907
01:03:43,242 --> 01:03:47,749
When Horton tells our children
about worlds beyond the jungle,

908
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:49,989
he makes them question authority!

909
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:53,952
Which leads to defiance!
Which leads to anarchy!

910
01:03:54,026 --> 01:03:56,415
Yeah! Horton must pay!

911
01:03:56,522 --> 01:03:57,929
It's that speck!

912
01:03:57,993 --> 01:03:59,781
We have to do something!

913
01:03:59,881 --> 01:04:01,158
For the children!

914
01:04:01,225 --> 01:04:02,566
For the children!

915
01:04:02,633 --> 01:04:07,368
Are we going to let him
get away with this?

916
01:04:07,433 --> 01:04:09,375
No!

917
01:04:09,608 --> 01:04:11,266
Let's go!

918
01:04:33,862 --> 01:04:37,210
Morton! I told you! 100%!

919
01:04:37,861 --> 01:04:38,941
Horton!

920
01:04:39,046 --> 01:04:41,347
Morton, pick up your feet! Jeez.

921
01:04:41,445 --> 01:04:42,906
It's not me!

922
01:04:44,805 --> 01:04:48,417
I see. It's an angry mob. Sorry, Morton.

923
01:04:48,516 --> 01:04:50,818
I thought it was you
that was making all the...

924
01:04:50,917 --> 01:04:52,258
But it's...

925
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:53,922
Oh, darn.

926
01:04:55,364 --> 01:04:56,793
Run, Horton!

927
01:04:57,668 --> 01:04:59,096
There he is!

928
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:01,601
Let's rope him!

929
01:05:01,667 --> 01:05:03,228
Let's cage him!

930
01:05:04,547 --> 01:05:07,449
No! No! No!

931
01:05:10,819 --> 01:05:12,379
Stop!

932
01:05:13,763 --> 01:05:15,835
Hey, fellas. Good to see you,

933
01:05:15,906 --> 01:05:17,280
all at once.

934
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:18,945
You look really great as a horde.

935
01:05:19,042 --> 01:05:20,951
Horton, Horton, Horton,

936
01:05:21,026 --> 01:05:24,571
look at the mess
you've created for yourself.

937
01:05:24,674 --> 01:05:28,251
All this hullabaloo over a silly little flower.

938
01:05:28,801 --> 01:05:30,262
It's a speck.

939
01:05:30,721 --> 01:05:35,292
Right. I mean, it's silly, really,
all this talk of roping you,

940
01:05:35,393 --> 01:05:39,582
and caging you, and, well,
we don't need to go into the details.

941
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:44,568
The point is, this angry mob,
all the trouble you're in,

942
01:05:44,672 --> 01:05:46,613
it can all go away.

943
01:05:48,863 --> 01:05:51,580
- Really?
- Of course.

944
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:56,951
All you have to do is admit to everyone
that there are no little people

945
01:05:57,022 --> 01:05:58,778
living on that speck.

946
01:05:58,878 --> 01:06:02,173
That you were wrong and I was right.

947
01:06:03,262 --> 01:06:08,247
You do that and things can go right back
to the way they were.

948
01:06:08,861 --> 01:06:14,905
But if you don't, you're going to
have to pay the price.

949
01:06:22,268 --> 01:06:24,821
So, I just have to say it isn't true?

950
01:06:29,787 --> 01:06:33,748
Go ahead. Rope me, cage me.
Do whatever you want.

951
01:06:34,171 --> 01:06:36,080
But there are people on this speck.

952
01:06:36,186 --> 01:06:40,496
And they have a Mayor, who has
96 daughters and one son named JoJo,

953
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:43,504
who all share a bathroom,
whatever that is,

954
01:06:44,794 --> 01:06:48,176
and even though you can't hear
or see them at all,

955
01:06:48,249 --> 01:06:51,445
a person's a person, no matter how small.

956
01:06:58,168 --> 01:07:00,885
That was beautiful, Horton.

957
01:07:01,336 --> 01:07:03,124
Rope him! Cage him!

958
01:07:03,224 --> 01:07:07,282
And burn that speck
in a pot of boiling Beezlenut oil!

959
01:07:11,511 --> 01:07:13,453
They don't believe we're here.

960
01:07:13,527 --> 01:07:15,599
We've got to make some noise!

961
01:07:15,703 --> 01:07:17,841
We are here! We are here! We are here!

962
01:07:17,943 --> 01:07:19,983
We are here! We are here! We are here!

963
01:07:20,055 --> 01:07:21,615
We are here! We are here! We are here!

964
01:07:21,687 --> 01:07:23,061
Come on!

965
01:07:23,574 --> 01:07:25,995
- Everybody!
- We are here! We are here! We are here!

966
01:07:26,102 --> 01:07:28,207
We are here! We are here! We are here!

967
01:07:36,373 --> 01:07:40,202
This will teach you not to make up stories
about people on specks!

968
01:07:40,309 --> 01:07:42,577
Listen! There they are!

969
01:07:46,324 --> 01:07:48,080
- Rope him.
- Cage him!

970
01:07:48,627 --> 01:07:50,220
It's not working.

971
01:07:50,547 --> 01:07:52,881
I can hear you,
but their ears aren't strong enough.

972
01:07:52,979 --> 01:07:54,572
We need to be louder!

973
01:07:54,643 --> 01:07:57,643
Get every Who to make noise! Everyone!

974
01:07:57,747 --> 01:08:01,195
We are here! We are here! We are here!

975
01:08:01,299 --> 01:08:03,339
JoJo! Where are you going?

976
01:08:03,507 --> 01:08:06,474
We need every voice! JoJo!

977
01:08:09,841 --> 01:08:13,997
You need to make some noise down there,
or we'll all be destroyed!

978
01:08:14,801 --> 01:08:18,096
<i>The Mayor grabbed a tom-tom</i>
<i>and started to smack it,</i>

979
01:08:19,281 --> 01:08:22,445
<i>and all over Whoville,</i>
<i>they whooped up a racket.</i>

980
01:08:24,529 --> 01:08:27,081
<i>They rattled tin kettles!</i>
<i>They beat on brass pans!</i>

981
01:08:27,184 --> 01:08:29,573
<i>On garbage pail tops</i>
<i>and old cranberry cans!</i>

982
01:08:29,648 --> 01:08:32,495
<i>They blew on bazookas</i>
<i>and blasted great toots.</i>

983
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,855
<i>On clarinets, oompahs,</i>
<i>and boompahs, and flutes!</i>

984
01:08:38,543 --> 01:08:39,688
There!

985
01:08:41,647 --> 01:08:43,021
Can they hear us now?

986
01:08:43,535 --> 01:08:47,496
Listen, please.
It's the most beautiful thing ever.

987
01:08:47,567 --> 01:08:49,355
I don't hear nothing!

988
01:08:49,806 --> 01:08:52,293
I don't think so. But keep trying.

989
01:08:53,454 --> 01:08:55,209
I'll never give in!

990
01:08:59,181 --> 01:09:03,109
Are you sure that every Who down
in Whoville is trying?

991
01:09:09,868 --> 01:09:11,242
We are here! We are here!

992
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:12,801
Where's JoJo?

993
01:09:12,876 --> 01:09:15,178
Probably at the old observatory.

994
01:09:28,170 --> 01:09:29,926
Hey! There's a limit!

995
01:09:36,937 --> 01:09:39,686
That's not supposed to stretch that far!

996
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:50,085
JoJo!

997
01:09:50,569 --> 01:09:52,030
You built this?

998
01:10:40,451 --> 01:10:43,800
We are here! We are here! We are here!

999
01:10:43,876 --> 01:10:46,875
We are here! We are here! We are here!

1000
01:10:48,355 --> 01:10:51,802
We are here! We are here! We are here!

1001
01:10:57,986 --> 01:11:00,352
You're making a mistake.

1002
01:11:02,562 --> 01:11:03,576
But, Mom!

1003
01:11:03,682 --> 01:11:06,399
This doesn't concern you, sweetie.
Back in your pouch!

1004
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:13,631
Everybody! Don't stop!

1005
01:11:16,288 --> 01:11:18,590
Keep going! This is gonna do it!

1006
01:11:18,688 --> 01:11:22,844
We are here! We are here! We are here!

1007
01:11:22,912 --> 01:11:24,024
Can they hear?

1008
01:11:24,128 --> 01:11:25,175
No!

1009
01:11:33,471 --> 01:11:36,951
No matter what happens,
I couldn't ask for a better son.

1010
01:11:40,478 --> 01:11:42,071
Hey, JoJo!

1011
01:11:42,685 --> 01:11:44,758
Come on! Keep going!

1012
01:11:49,437 --> 01:11:51,030
No!

1013
01:11:55,805 --> 01:11:59,252
We are here! We are here! We are here!

1014
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:03,827
No!

1015
01:12:10,043 --> 01:12:12,345
Yopp!

1016
01:12:17,947 --> 01:12:23,216
We are here! We are here! We are here!

1017
01:12:24,314 --> 01:12:26,103
I hear it! I hear it!

1018
01:12:26,554 --> 01:12:27,699
They are there!

1019
01:12:27,801 --> 01:12:32,340
<i>And that Yopp,</i>
<i>that one small extra Yopp put it over,</i>

1020
01:12:32,442 --> 01:12:35,158
<i>and all the Who noises</i>
<i>burst out of the clover.</i>

1021
01:12:35,225 --> 01:12:36,949
- I hear it!
- Me, too!

1022
01:12:38,905 --> 01:12:41,294
Rudy. Give me that! Come...

1023
01:12:43,704 --> 01:12:46,901
Rudy. Get back in the pouch. Now!

1024
01:12:49,496 --> 01:12:50,772
No, Mom.

1025
01:12:52,791 --> 01:12:54,930
Wickershams! Get that clover!

1026
01:12:57,911 --> 01:13:00,464
Anybody! Take it from him!

1027
01:13:11,542 --> 01:13:14,062
You did it, Mayor. You did it.

1028
01:13:15,413 --> 01:13:16,689
We did it!

1029
01:13:19,701 --> 01:13:21,162
Yeah!

1030
01:13:25,716 --> 01:13:27,178
Well done, son.

1031
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,125
All right, Mayor!

1032
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:33,100
Dad, you're one of the greats!

1033
01:13:37,075 --> 01:13:39,628
Whoa. Easy, everyone! Easy!

1034
01:13:41,139 --> 01:13:42,546
Hi, Vlad.

1035
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:48,297
Well, I shouldn't, but...

1036
01:14:15,823 --> 01:14:17,962
Oh, man, that is nice touch.

1037
01:14:18,703 --> 01:14:23,078
I am a mess with this, right?
Emotional! Here come the waterslide.

1038
01:14:24,687 --> 01:14:26,825
There's so many people to thank.

1039
01:14:26,894 --> 01:14:28,585
The good people of Nool,

1040
01:14:28,654 --> 01:14:30,694
who put me in a cage
and poked me with sticks.

1041
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:31,879
That was me!

1042
01:14:31,982 --> 01:14:35,016
My buddy Morton, for being the only one
who stood by me.

1043
01:14:35,086 --> 01:14:36,198
Well, not right by me.

1044
01:14:36,302 --> 01:14:39,814
He hid in the bushes,
sending me good thoughts. He's small.

1045
01:14:39,885 --> 01:14:42,089
Dude, you are a warrior poet.

1046
01:14:42,413 --> 01:14:46,057
And most of all, I'd like to thank
the Mayor of Whoville,

1047
01:14:46,125 --> 01:14:47,554
<i>who believed in me from the beginning.</i>

1048
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:51,075
Horton, we're going to miss you.

1049
01:14:53,292 --> 01:14:54,918
What are we gonna do
without you, Horton?

1050
01:14:55,308 --> 01:14:58,090
Don't worry. I'll always be around.

1051
01:14:59,148 --> 01:15:02,049
<i>And even as I wander</i>

1052
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:04,490
<i>I'm keeping you in sight</i>

1053
01:15:04,587 --> 01:15:06,921
<i>You're a candle in the window</i>

1054
01:15:07,019 --> 01:15:08,961
<i>On a cold, dark winter's night</i>

1055
01:15:09,066 --> 01:15:10,342
Beautiful metaphor.

1056
01:15:10,411 --> 01:15:12,614
<i>And I'm getting closer</i>

1057
01:15:12,682 --> 01:15:17,254
<i>Than I ever thought I might</i>

1058
01:15:17,738 --> 01:15:19,876
That's a little high for me.

1059
01:15:19,978 --> 01:15:24,898
<i>Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore</i>

1060
01:15:25,417 --> 01:15:30,435
<i>I've forgotten what I started fighting for</i>

1061
01:15:31,016 --> 01:15:33,733
<i>And if I have to crawl upon your floor</i>

1062
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,044
<i>Crawl upon the floor</i>

1063
01:15:35,144 --> 01:15:36,485
<i>Come crashing through your door</i>

1064
01:15:36,584 --> 01:15:37,762
<i>Crashing through your door</i>

1065
01:15:37,863 --> 01:15:41,060
<i>Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore</i>

1066
01:15:41,128 --> 01:15:47,554
<i>I can't fight this feeling anymore</i>

1067
01:15:51,302 --> 01:15:55,677
<i>And so all ended well,</i>
<i>for both Horton and Whos,</i>

1068
01:15:55,782 --> 01:15:59,011
<i>and for all in the jungle, even kangaroos.</i>

1069
01:15:59,078 --> 01:16:02,209
<i>So let that be a lesson, to one and to all.</i>

1070
01:16:02,277 --> 01:16:06,685
<i>A person's a person,</i>
<i>no matter how small.</i>

1071
01:16:23,524 --> 01:16:26,044
<i>And I can't fight this feeling anymore</i>

1072
01:16:26,115 --> 01:16:28,002
Yeah, I like this. Faster, more up-tempo.

1073
01:16:28,099 --> 01:16:31,001
<i>I've forgotten what I started fighting for</i>

1074
01:16:31,075 --> 01:16:32,984
<i>I can't fight this feeling</i>

1075
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:36,123
<i>It's time to bring my ship into your shore</i>

1076
01:16:36,194 --> 01:16:37,209
That's a metaphor!

1077
01:16:37,282 --> 01:16:38,362
<i>And throw away the oar</i>

1078
01:16:38,435 --> 01:16:39,482
Another metaphor!

1079
01:16:39,554 --> 01:16:41,310
<i>And buy an engine</i>

1080
01:16:43,393 --> 01:16:46,175
<i>'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore</i>

1081
01:16:46,241 --> 01:16:48,096
<i>From the weight of my trunk to my toes</i>

1082
01:16:48,161 --> 01:16:50,911
<i>I've forgotten what I started fighting for</i>

1083
01:16:51,009 --> 01:16:53,398
Well, you shouldn't be fighting anything.
Enjoy yourself.

1084
01:16:53,473 --> 01:16:56,506
<i>If I have to crawl across the floor</i>

1085
01:16:56,609 --> 01:16:59,161
<i>- Now, break down your stupid door</i>
<i>- Crashing through your door</i>

1086
01:16:59,232 --> 01:17:01,949
<i>Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore</i>

1087
01:17:02,048 --> 01:17:03,292
<i>On an empty stomach</i>

1088
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,531
<i>I can't fight this feeling</i>

1089
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,705
<i>I can't fight this feeling</i>

1090
01:17:11,391 --> 01:17:13,278
I'm just saying words.

1091
01:17:15,167 --> 01:17:18,007
That felt so good.
Cathartic!

1092
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:19,448
What?
