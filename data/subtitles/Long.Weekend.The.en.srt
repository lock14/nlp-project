1
00:00:16,362 --> 00:00:18,330
Asshole!

2
00:00:25,642 --> 00:00:27,485
Oh, f-u-u-uck!

3
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,710
R3V0LV3R.

4
00:00:51,042 --> 00:00:52,771
Oh, Shit!

5
00:00:56,162 --> 00:00:58,129
Ready?

6
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:00,442
Ow! Ow! Aargh!

7
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:08,130
Ohh!

8
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:11,970
Aaargh!

9
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:15,809
Oooh!

10
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:18,602
Yaargh!

11
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:19,648
Jesus!

12
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:26,168
Aargh!

13
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:31,889
Ohh!

14
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,009
Aargh, Jeez!

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,971
It hurts!

16
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:04,207
OK.

17
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,365
I don't suppose anyone remembers
the first moment they opened their eyes.

18
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,010
- Push.
- I sure don't.

19
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,243
But for my little brother Ed, l imagine
this is what the world looked like.

20
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,202
Little man.

21
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,623
Because this is how we 'd
see things all through

22
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:23,206
childhood, adolescence,
and into adulthood.

23
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,367
You see, ever since he was strong enough
to lift a video camera,

24
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,168
he's had one pressed to his face.

25
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:33,290
He didn't mind what he was videoing
as long as he was videoing.

26
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,687
Ed. Hey.

27
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:43,961
I don't think we really
need to record Mr

28
00:02:43,962 --> 00:02:46,360
Fiddlesticks eating his
own poop for posterity.

29
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:49,727
OK He did get some funny stuff i'll admit.

30
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:52,289
But he didn't live life.

31
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:54,248
He viewed it.

32
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,004
Then edited the best
bits and archived them.

33
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,728
I mean, he was barely aware
of monumental world events,

34
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:06,248
but he could tell you the exact date
cousin Stevie gave up karate.

35
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,126
Ow!

36
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:12,170
Sure the guy was a nerd,
but he was my brother, and I loved him.

37
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,725
He was always there to capture
my many outstanding stage performances.

38
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:19,881
O you, the doors of breath
sealed with a righteous kiss.

39
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:24,001
Way to go, buddy!

40
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,730
And I hoped he'd give it up
when he went to college.

41
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:29,925
Instead, he found a whole new world to film.

42
00:03:29,998 --> 00:03:31,363
Hey, Ed.

43
00:03:32,118 --> 00:03:35,123
But he never made really good use
of his camera.

44
00:03:35,198 --> 00:03:37,883
- Unlike his roommate, Jack.
- Oh, Jack! Oh!

45
00:03:38,798 --> 00:03:41,039
Oh, Jack, it's so big! Oh!

46
00:03:41,118 --> 00:03:44,406
It's so hot! Oh! Oh!

47
00:03:47,238 --> 00:03:51,323
He even had the damn thing pressed to face
when he met his girlfriend Cathy.

48
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:55,164
She got me where she want me...

49
00:03:56,878 --> 00:03:58,243
Oh, Shit!

50
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:00,286
She said, "Baby, come on"

51
00:04:08,117 --> 00:04:09,961
Jesus!

52
00:04:10,038 --> 00:04:12,005
I think I hit a retarded man.

53
00:04:12,758 --> 00:04:14,965
Sometimes I think she was right.

54
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:17,405
After graduation, they moved in together.

55
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:20,399
And Ed got a job in advertising.

56
00:04:24,158 --> 00:04:26,205
According to his boss, he was a natural.

57
00:04:26,278 --> 00:04:27,564
Ed?

58
00:04:27,638 --> 00:04:29,605
You are a natural, my son.

59
00:04:29,677 --> 00:04:31,567
You've won another award.

60
00:04:33,237 --> 00:04:37,288
You keep this up, and I'll see what I can
do about getting you a corner office.

61
00:04:37,357 --> 00:04:39,325
- Thank you, Frank.
- Good boy.

62
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:48,522
Five buck tip?

63
00:04:48,597 --> 00:04:50,520
Five bucks, that's it?

64
00:04:50,597 --> 00:04:52,338
Was there something wrong
with your sandwich, sir?

65
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:54,079
Was the coffee cold?

66
00:04:54,157 --> 00:04:56,421
No, the sandwich and the
coffee were fine, but

67
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:58,685
I ordered a cheeseburger
and an iced tea.

68
00:04:59,517 --> 00:05:00,882
I'm sorry, man.

69
00:05:00,956 --> 00:05:02,925
Do you need another five?

70
00:05:02,997 --> 00:05:04,203
Here's ten.

71
00:05:05,277 --> 00:05:07,244
Hey, thanks a lot.

72
00:05:08,717 --> 00:05:10,082
What are brothers for?

73
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:12,124
I'll get you back real
soon, I promise, man.

74
00:05:12,197 --> 00:05:14,848
My agent says I am so close
to my first big break.

75
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:17,966
She said you were so close
two and a half years ago.

76
00:05:18,036 --> 00:05:20,403
Yeah, well, that was two
and a half years ago.

77
00:05:20,476 --> 00:05:24,879
I have an audition for a Japanese whisky
commercial tomorrow. Do you believe it?

78
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,799
Cooper, you're in your mid-20s.

79
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:29,959
You've been doing this acting thing for,
what, six years now?

80
00:05:30,036 --> 00:05:31,800
Yeah, give or take.

81
00:05:31,876 --> 00:05:35,005
I think it's time you moved on,
thought about the future.

82
00:05:35,075 --> 00:05:37,044
Become an adult like I have.

83
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,925
Did I mention he 'd become
a tiny bit condescending?

84
00:05:44,715 --> 00:05:46,479
Hey, Cathy?

85
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,797
I picked up your stuff from the cleaners.

86
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,083
Cathy?

87
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:54,842
Cathy?

88
00:05:56,595 --> 00:05:57,757
Pumpkin?

89
00:05:58,636 --> 00:05:59,922
Ed.

90
00:06:00,675 --> 00:06:02,041
Jack? Hi.

91
00:06:02,116 --> 00:06:03,685
Hi.

92
00:06:04,716 --> 00:06:06,240
Are you ill?

93
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:09,285
Where's Cathy?

94
00:06:14,795 --> 00:06:16,559
Cathy, what's going on?

95
00:06:20,835 --> 00:06:22,075
Say something.

96
00:06:26,915 --> 00:06:28,997
I don’t think we should
see each other any more.

97
00:06:29,075 --> 00:06:30,998
What? No. Why? No!

98
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:33,157
What are you talking about?

99
00:06:33,235 --> 00:06:35,203
I mean, this is... fine.

100
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:37,242
I mean, we can work it out, right?

101
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,885
I mean, a lot of people, they... Jack?

102
00:06:39,954 --> 00:06:41,923
Can I have a moment with her?

103
00:06:41,995 --> 00:06:43,963
Oh, yeah, sorry, man.

104
00:06:45,795 --> 00:06:48,240
A lot of people have...

105
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:50,838
...affairs, you know?

106
00:06:50,914 --> 00:06:52,917
It doesn't mean they've got to break up.

107
00:06:52,994 --> 00:06:53,961
Right?

108
00:06:54,034 --> 00:06:57,800
There are some things
i'll just never understand about Ed.

109
00:06:57,874 --> 00:07:00,639
He could forgive Cathy for blowing Jack...

110
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,804
..but then totally lost it
when he saw she was filming it

111
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:16,474
I helped him throw out every camera and
his entire obsessive compulsive archive.

112
00:07:16,554 --> 00:07:21,037
And rather than going on a mission to fuck
as many of Cathy's friends as possible,

113
00:07:21,794 --> 00:07:25,003
Ed just moved out and swore
he 'd never touch a video camera again.

114
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:36,719
In an instant
Ed had gotten rid of Cathy and home video.

115
00:07:37,554 --> 00:07:40,125
And I can't say I was sorry
to see either of them go.

116
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:45,484
I thought he 'd finally start exploring
life, having fun, getting pussy.

117
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:47,874
But he got even more
bottled up than before.

118
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:53,640
Yeah, well, what my brother Cooper
didn't know is that was living a nightmare.

119
00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:57,995
Dude, she is going crazy. I shit you not.

120
00:07:58,073 --> 00:08:01,759
She's digging her nails in, she's
screaming, she's moaning, she's like,

121
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:05,154
"Oh, do me. Do me. I feel like a whore."

122
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:09,636
At random moments, scenes from my archives
kept coming back into my head.

123
00:08:09,713 --> 00:08:12,319
Stop! Stop! Stop!

124
00:08:12,393 --> 00:08:16,034
She's like, "Uh, uh, uh, uh!"
I'm like, “Get off of it!"

125
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:17,763
It's like dust coming out.

126
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:19,801
Or at the doctor's.

127
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,398
Now, Mr Waxman,
you may feel a little discomfort.

128
00:08:24,432 --> 00:08:26,401
Just try to relax.

129
00:08:31,273 --> 00:08:33,639
Even worse, it affected me at work.

130
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:35,123
Mr Mclntyre,

131
00:08:35,193 --> 00:08:37,014
I must say that we here
at Barnes, Butcher,

132
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:38,833
Leiber, Melchett, Farquhar,
Hidalgo, and Roper

133
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:41,916
are one lucky advertising agency
to have a client as...

134
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:45,520
..enlightened as yourself.

135
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,959
- And I'm not just saying that.
- Thank you.

136
00:08:48,032 --> 00:08:51,559
It is nothing but elegant and classy.

137
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:52,997
That was you.

138
00:08:53,072 --> 00:08:55,996
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you your new ad campaign,

139
00:08:56,072 --> 00:08:58,961
which rolls out nationwide next week.

140
00:08:59,032 --> 00:09:01,000
Ed, if you'll do the honours.

141
00:09:08,352 --> 00:09:11,117
"Real fur. Ifs fur real."

142
00:09:15,392 --> 00:09:16,359
Yeah!

143
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:17,876
Wa-hay!

144
00:09:18,831 --> 00:09:21,233
There it is! That's what I'm talking about!

145
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,358
Whoo!

146
00:09:30,191 --> 00:09:32,160
That's right Yeah!

147
00:09:35,111 --> 00:09:37,079
What a bunch of assholes.

148
00:09:37,151 --> 00:09:41,042
Do you really think this is going to
get people to start wearing fur again?

149
00:09:41,111 --> 00:09:43,921
That question falls into
the "Who gives a fuck?" Category.

150
00:09:43,991 --> 00:09:46,675
Mclntyre wanted that slogan,
and it's his damn money.

151
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,241
You know what I'm saying?

152
00:09:48,311 --> 00:09:50,171
We're here to help people
sell their product,

153
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,032
not just agree with
what they say.

154
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:55,956
It's called keeping the client nappy.
L know this is a new concept for you.

155
00:09:56,031 --> 00:09:57,874
Remind me, how many have you lost now?

156
00:09:57,951 --> 00:09:59,521
Four? Or is it five?

157
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:03,073
A big agency like BBLMFH&R
can handle a couple of lost clients.

158
00:10:10,671 --> 00:10:12,195
Hey. What's going on?

159
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,956
Great Bridge Insurance
has withdrawn its account from us.

160
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,272
Oh, Shit.

161
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,038
I guess you heard the news, huh?

162
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,078
Nervous?

163
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,118
I have nothing to be nervous about.

164
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,798
I just stopped by to bring you this.

165
00:10:36,989 --> 00:10:39,436
You know, just a little something to say

166
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,237
thanks for your help on
the McIntyre account.

167
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,277
Wow.

168
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:45,354
Er... thank you.

169
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,876
That's great. I didn't mean the whole um...

170
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,394
There's nothing in it.

171
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,197
Oh, the box, that's the gift.

172
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,877
I thought you might need something
to clear your desk into on Monday.

173
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,032
You're not my boss. You can't fire me.

174
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,077
Ed, can I see you in my office?

175
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:12,313
Ed, when I first hired you,
you were like a dynamo.

176
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,552
You had an unusual way of looking at life,
and l liked that.

177
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:18,633
But after your intended did the dirty,
things have got a bit...

178
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:20,677
I never let that affect my work, Frank.

179
00:11:21,429 --> 00:11:23,193
Well, let's see, shall we?

180
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:24,873
Skechers shoes.

181
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:27,950
"Perfect for Kicking a man when he's down."

182
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:31,119
Kahn's antiseptic.

183
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:33,452
"Not so good for when
she's ripped your heart

184
00:11:33,453 --> 00:11:35,716
out of your chest and
thrown it in the trash."

185
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:38,758
Yeah, but they're not all like that.
Here, look.

186
00:11:40,468 --> 00:11:42,311
"Pacific Rim Telephone.

187
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:43,720
Only 3 cents a minute."

188
00:11:43,789 --> 00:11:45,790
Only 3 cents a minute?

189
00:11:51,348 --> 00:11:53,316
"We can still make it work.

190
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:55,436
Just call for 3 cents a minute."

191
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:58,240
- So, what are you saying?
- You're fired.

192
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:01,471
Aaargh!

193
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:05,675
OK.

194
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:08,796
What if I make Great Bridge stay?

195
00:12:08,868 --> 00:12:12,156
What if I come up with a campaign
that will win them back?

196
00:12:12,228 --> 00:12:15,118
We've had the whole creative department
on this for six months.

197
00:12:15,188 --> 00:12:17,633
You think you can turn
that around by Monday?

198
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,472
Monday?

199
00:12:21,188 --> 00:12:22,952
Yeah.

200
00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:26,589
Yeah. I'm going to make 'em stay.
I'm going to come up with a campaign.

201
00:12:26,668 --> 00:12:28,635
If you do that...

202
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:32,189
you cannot only keep your job,
you can have this office.

203
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,955
I'm not going to let you down.

204
00:12:38,227 --> 00:12:40,798
- Where are we putting this?
- Roger's office.

205
00:12:42,948 --> 00:12:44,915
Hey! Hey! Hey, put it down!

206
00:12:44,987 --> 00:12:46,955
Put it down. I'm on the payroll st...

207
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,195
They took my coat!

208
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:27,874
Oh-ho!

209
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:35,236
Whoo!

210
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,033
Hey.

211
00:14:01,146 --> 00:14:03,113
It is dead animals in the shaft.

212
00:14:03,186 --> 00:14:04,391
What animals?

213
00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:06,434
Uh... rats...

214
00:14:06,506 --> 00:14:08,872
uh... mice, cats.

215
00:14:08,946 --> 00:14:10,789
Cats?

216
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:13,647
The cats go in after
the mice and rats, and

217
00:14:13,648 --> 00:14:16,430
then they get stuck, and
they starve and die.

218
00:14:16,506 --> 00:14:18,826
Then they decompose, and the rotting flesh

219
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:21,875
releases the offending odour
that you're smelling now.

220
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,516
I see.

221
00:14:25,145 --> 00:14:27,113
Try breathing through your mouth.

222
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:35,067
Try breathing through your mouth?

223
00:14:35,145 --> 00:14:37,113
Could this day suck any more?

224
00:14:37,905 --> 00:14:39,191
Happy Birthday?

225
00:14:40,385 --> 00:14:41,955
Owl Shit!

226
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:43,595
What are you doing?

227
00:14:43,665 --> 00:14:45,793
It's your birthday.
I wanted to surprise you.

228
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:47,549
- What, by blinding me?
- Oh, come on.

229
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,832
That's what big brothers are for. Sit down.

230
00:14:49,904 --> 00:14:52,749
Come on, I got some presents for you.
We're all set.

231
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,314
Open it up. Open it up.

232
00:14:57,824 --> 00:14:59,827
It's the bottle of Glen Kyoto. That's...

233
00:14:59,905 --> 00:15:01,953
Hey, you know it.

234
00:15:05,985 --> 00:15:07,907
And look at this. Wow.

235
00:15:07,984 --> 00:15:09,908
That's a Glen Kyoto T-shirt.

236
00:15:09,984 --> 00:15:12,430
Oh, look at this great piece of artwork.

237
00:15:12,505 --> 00:15:14,950
Wow, that's a Glen Kyoto
ashtray, of course.

238
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:18,790
That's uncanny, cos just today, I was
thinking about taking up smoking, so...

239
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:22,152
- Call that brotherly intuition.
- Thank you, buddy.

240
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:23,794
Don't thank me.

241
00:15:23,864 --> 00:15:27,550
Thank the number-one-selling
Japanese rice whisky in the world.

242
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:30,628
Puts a roof over our head
and tastes delicious, right?

243
00:15:30,704 --> 00:15:32,706
Oh, hey.

244
00:15:32,784 --> 00:15:34,752
- These came for you.
- Oh, yeah.

245
00:15:34,824 --> 00:15:36,588
Fan mail.

246
00:15:36,664 --> 00:15:38,746
Oh, my God.

247
00:15:38,824 --> 00:15:41,304
How'd you like to have that
wrapped around your cock?

248
00:15:41,384 --> 00:15:43,352
On, dirty.

249
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,794
But I'd do her. Would you do her?

250
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:47,593
You'd definitely do her. Come on.

251
00:15:48,664 --> 00:15:49,949
- Oh!
- Ooh.

252
00:15:50,024 --> 00:15:53,187
Oh. Fat man in little panties.

253
00:15:53,264 --> 00:15:55,630
That one's yours. Oh, hey, I nearly forgot.

254
00:15:55,703 --> 00:15:57,671
Got you one more present.

255
00:15:57,743 --> 00:15:59,507
"Bup, buh, dah, ba"

256
00:16:01,263 --> 00:16:03,266
Well, what do you think, huh?

257
00:16:03,344 --> 00:16:05,664
Come on. This thing is the very latest.

258
00:16:05,743 --> 00:16:10,829
I swear to God, man, you could shoot a cum
shot from a mile away with this thing.

259
00:16:13,983 --> 00:16:15,985
Now What's the matter? You don't like it?

260
00:16:16,063 --> 00:16:17,633
You know my promise:

261
00:16:17,703 --> 00:16:20,547
I will never film another inch
of home video footage again.

262
00:16:20,623 --> 00:16:22,546
It's over a year since Cathy dumped you.

263
00:16:22,622 --> 00:16:25,467
She didn't dump me. It was mutual.

264
00:16:26,983 --> 00:16:28,223
Aaargh!

265
00:16:28,302 --> 00:16:29,270
Shit?

266
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,991
Ed, you love home video, man.

267
00:16:32,063 --> 00:16:35,783
Don't you think it's time you got over her
and that stupid little promise?

268
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:38,427
Oh, hey, Ed.

269
00:16:38,502 --> 00:16:40,471
Come on, man, this thing's perfect.

270
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:42,671
- I got work to do.
- Come on, man.

271
00:16:42,742 --> 00:16:45,473
Cathy and Jack would be happy
to have a camera like this.

272
00:16:46,302 --> 00:16:48,271
Wait a minute. Ed!

273
00:16:48,343 --> 00:16:49,503
Hey, Ed.

274
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,550
Ed, wait a minute, man.

275
00:16:51,622 --> 00:16:53,671
You've got to go out. It's your birthday.

276
00:16:53,742 --> 00:16:55,870
I'm going to have to take
a rain check on that.

277
00:16:55,942 --> 00:16:59,345
But it's your birthday.
You got to go out. It's the law.

278
00:16:59,422 --> 00:17:02,312
- I have to work or I'm toast.
- We 'll go to Gonigan's.

279
00:17:02,383 --> 00:17:04,862
We'll have a quiet drink
between two brothers.

280
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:06,307
No, I can't,

281
00:17:06,382 --> 00:17:09,431
You won't achieve anything
staring at these four walls.

282
00:17:09,502 --> 00:17:11,470
Art imitates life, right?

283
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:13,510
And you need a life. Come on.

284
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:18,307
Ha ha! That a boy!
Come on, this will be fun.

285
00:17:18,902 --> 00:17:20,586
"THE STINGERS: Getaway"

286
00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:27,543
"First the money gets away"

287
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:30,191
You never told me, how was that audition?

288
00:17:30,262 --> 00:17:33,071
- I didn't get a call back.
- No way!

289
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:34,922
- Did they give a reason?

290
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:36,702
- I didn't technically
make it to the audition.

291
00:17:36,781 --> 00:17:39,069
Got a little sidetracked,
if you know what I mean.

292
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:40,188
Oh, Jeez.

293
00:17:43,422 --> 00:17:45,788
- Isn't Gonigan's to the right?
- Oh, yeah.

294
00:17:45,861 --> 00:17:47,670
Just got to pick up a couple of friends.

295
00:17:47,741 --> 00:17:49,385
- I thought this was just
going to be the two of us.

296
00:17:49,386 --> 00:17:51,029
- It is.

297
00:17:51,101 --> 00:17:53,069
The two of us and a couple of girls.

298
00:17:53,142 --> 00:17:55,109
- I can't believe you!
- What?

299
00:17:55,181 --> 00:17:58,264
Come on, you'll love these girls.
They're total Sweeties.

300
00:17:58,341 --> 00:18:00,503
And Susie is definitely your type.

301
00:18:02,141 --> 00:18:04,109
- Coopie.
- Hi, Jo.

302
00:18:06,741 --> 00:18:08,709
Uh... Susie.

303
00:18:08,781 --> 00:18:10,988
This is my brother, Ed.

304
00:18:11,061 --> 00:18:13,029
- Hello.
- Hi.

305
00:18:14,381 --> 00:18:17,350
Um... l got to go finish my make-up.

306
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,587
Coopie?

307
00:18:19,661 --> 00:18:21,628
You come with me?

308
00:18:23,781 --> 00:18:25,545
Its his birthday.

309
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,029
Ehm... shall we open this?

310
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,229
Don't bother. We already got one open.

311
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,588
- There you go.
- Thank you.

312
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,590
Its delicious.

313
00:18:56,659 --> 00:18:58,230
Yeah, it's so big.

314
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,308
Oh, I'm a whore, yeah.

315
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,824
Ehh...

316
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,905
Spank me.

317
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,948
Spank me, Daddy.

318
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,987
Oh, yeah!

319
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,664
So, what do you do?

320
00:19:13,739 --> 00:19:15,344
I'm a nurse.

321
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,709
Wow, that's a tough job.

322
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:20,942
So few people are really
making a difference in the world,

323
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,420
and look at you, you're out
there curing illnesses,

324
00:19:23,421 --> 00:19:25,820
and healing injuries,
and saving lives.

325
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:28,389
I Work in an abortion clinic.

326
00:19:30,139 --> 00:19:32,506
Ohh!

327
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:37,749
Right! So.

328
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:43,984
So, Susie,

329
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:46,443
was Ed here telling
you that he's an

330
00:19:46,444 --> 00:19:48,826
award-winning advertising
executive Supremo?

331
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:50,867
The kid's a dynamo.

332
00:19:56,618 --> 00:19:57,983
Oops.

333
00:20:08,818 --> 00:20:09,899
Who's hungry?

334
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:11,946
"BOSSHOUSE: You Roll I'll Drive"

335
00:20:12,018 --> 00:20:13,589
"We're the only ones here alive..."

336
00:20:13,658 --> 00:20:16,309
And so Ed runs eight miles.

337
00:20:16,378 --> 00:20:20,542
And I'm not talking your average over the
river and through the woods here, ladies.

338
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:24,509
I'm talking the most treacherous terrain
you can possibly imagine.

339
00:20:24,578 --> 00:20:27,058
I'm talking jumping over snake pits.

340
00:20:27,138 --> 00:20:31,780
I'm talking about this man was chased by
wolves just to find somebody with a phone

341
00:20:31,858 --> 00:20:36,147
to then call the airborne forest rangers,
who arrived just in the nick of time

342
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:40,507
to save the entire boy scout troop.

343
00:20:41,378 --> 00:20:46,225
Had it not been for my brother's grit,
determination and sheer heroism,

344
00:20:47,017 --> 00:20:48,986
they may have all died.

345
00:20:49,058 --> 00:20:51,026
You're a genuine hero.

346
00:20:51,098 --> 00:20:53,065
Is all that true?

347
00:20:55,377 --> 00:20:57,745
Cooper may be exaggerating a bit.

348
00:20:58,538 --> 00:20:59,903
The er...

349
00:20:59,978 --> 00:21:03,460
The bus actually drove off the road
to avoid hitting me.

350
00:21:03,537 --> 00:21:06,302
But he did run eight miles.

351
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:07,981
I mean, can you imagine?

352
00:21:08,057 --> 00:21:10,537
Yes, that's true, in the wrong direction.

353
00:21:11,378 --> 00:21:13,425
They were found by a passing hiker,

354
00:21:13,497 --> 00:21:15,784
and then he called out the forest rangers,
and then

355
00:21:16,618 --> 00:21:19,507
they came in helicopters,
actually, and found me.

356
00:21:19,577 --> 00:21:22,660
The point here is, ladies,
that everyone was saved.

357
00:21:23,377 --> 00:21:24,822
Yes.

358
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:26,865
There you go.

359
00:21:28,657 --> 00:21:31,900
Except the guy who lost his legs.
There was a guy who lost his legs.

360
00:21:32,856 --> 00:21:35,781
Food. Outstanding.

361
00:21:35,857 --> 00:21:39,019
Ladies, let's get it on here, huh?
The night is young.

362
00:21:39,777 --> 00:21:41,619
Drink it up and enjoy.

363
00:21:41,696 --> 00:21:43,984
Susie, let's go.
The game is strip coasters.

364
00:21:44,057 --> 00:21:46,024
Let's do it Top comes off.

365
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,587
OK.

366
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:50,703
Got it.

367
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,187
Good catch.

368
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,906
- Lucky you.
- Thank you, thank you.

369
00:21:53,976 --> 00:21:55,580
OK. Your turn.

370
00:21:55,656 --> 00:21:59,297
Eddie, you're up. Come on now, buddy
Show her you're an athlete.

371
00:22:09,256 --> 00:22:11,065
He shoots, he scores, huh?

372
00:22:11,136 --> 00:22:14,458
Excellent shot! Did you see that?

373
00:22:22,815 --> 00:22:24,341
Would you excuse me for a moment?

374
00:22:25,736 --> 00:22:28,500
- Where's the men's room?
- It's in the back there.

375
00:22:29,775 --> 00:22:32,256
- Right or left?
- Hey just follow your nose.

376
00:22:32,335 --> 00:22:34,304
Gook luck.

377
00:22:47,215 --> 00:22:49,183
Oh, no.

378
00:23:02,895 --> 00:23:04,659
Ohh.

379
00:23:14,615 --> 00:23:16,582
Oh, it burns.

380
00:23:25,814 --> 00:23:27,783
No.

381
00:23:35,695 --> 00:23:37,139
I can't wipe with that.

382
00:24:09,454 --> 00:24:11,217
Oh, hey. Hey, brother.

383
00:24:11,293 --> 00:24:13,455
Listen, you mind if you take Susie home?

384
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:16,104
- Where are you going?
- Oh, Jo's not feeling well.

385
00:24:16,173 --> 00:24:18,541
- What's wrong with her?
- You know, I'm not sure.

386
00:24:18,614 --> 00:24:21,298
But I better take her home
and take her temperature,

387
00:24:21,373 --> 00:24:23,456
vaginally with my flesh thermometer.

388
00:24:24,493 --> 00:24:26,541
Susie's totally into you, by the way.

389
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:30,177
Here, man.

390
00:24:30,253 --> 00:24:32,221
Look alive. Have some fun, will you?

391
00:24:33,253 --> 00:24:34,414
Ladies.

392
00:24:34,493 --> 00:24:37,258
Jo, what do you say
we get the fuck out of here, huh?

393
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,301
I am ready for dessert.

394
00:24:39,373 --> 00:24:41,455
Oh, yeah. Spanking's on the menu.

395
00:24:51,893 --> 00:24:53,656
Can I walk you home?

396
00:24:53,732 --> 00:24:54,814
Sure.

397
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:57,293
But I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

398
00:24:59,012 --> 00:25:00,981
I'm not that Kind of girl.

399
00:25:01,053 --> 00:25:05,024
Don't you think there's something
just so sexy about the city at night?

400
00:25:05,092 --> 00:25:07,277
There's something about
knowing that thousands

401
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:09,461
of people all around
us are doing it.

402
00:25:09,532 --> 00:25:13,037
Old people, married folks,
adulterers, teenagers,

403
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:16,541
virgins losing it for
the first time...

404
00:25:17,572 --> 00:25:21,133
..all enjoying the intimate knowledge
of each others' hot bodies.

405
00:25:21,212 --> 00:25:22,976
Shim If you're really quiet,

406
00:25:23,052 --> 00:25:26,738
you can almost hear the rhythmic sound
of all that sex going on.

407
00:25:27,812 --> 00:25:29,576
Makes you think, doesn't it?

408
00:25:32,412 --> 00:25:34,699
Yeah. Well, it was really nice to meet you.

409
00:25:34,772 --> 00:25:36,740
Um... good luck with everything.

410
00:25:40,892 --> 00:25:42,542
Loser.

411
00:25:47,332 --> 00:25:48,856
What are you doing here?

412
00:25:49,892 --> 00:25:51,495
I live here, Where should I be?

413
00:25:51,571 --> 00:25:53,540
Six inches inside Susie.

414
00:25:53,611 --> 00:25:55,774
She was my final birthday present to you.

415
00:25:55,851 --> 00:25:56,818
What?

416
00:25:56,891 --> 00:26:00,101
A birthday present from me to you.

417
00:26:00,171 --> 00:26:02,220
A girl that doesn't know how to say no.

418
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:04,737
She specifically told me
she wasn't interested.

419
00:26:04,811 --> 00:26:06,381
All women say that.

420
00:26:06,451 --> 00:26:08,818
It's just a hoop they
make you jump through.

421
00:26:08,892 --> 00:26:10,256
Oh, man.

422
00:26:10,331 --> 00:26:13,175
I cannot believe you didn't do her.
She's fucked everyone.

423
00:26:14,691 --> 00:26:17,012
Get some action soon,
or you could die of DSB.

424
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:18,058
DSB?

425
00:26:18,131 --> 00:26:19,735
Dangerous Sperm Build-up.

426
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:22,899
"1812 Overture"

427
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:27,699
You think I haven't been trying?

428
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:30,581
I mean, I keep striking out.
I'm crap with women.

429
00:26:30,651 --> 00:26:33,222
Then let me help you.
I'm serious. Let me help you.

430
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,622
Let me help you.

431
00:26:34,691 --> 00:26:37,297
- I have to work.
- I can work around your work.

432
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,499
I'm spending this weekend at the office.

433
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,653
Come on. I can be your doctor of love.

434
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:44,097
I can be your feel-good professor.

435
00:26:44,171 --> 00:26:47,572
- You're not listening.
- I will be your pallbearer of pussy.

436
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,892
I can be your psychiatrist of snatch.

437
00:26:49,971 --> 00:26:51,893
Give you the bible of booty, buddy.

438
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:54,815
It'll be fantastic. You cant stop me.
You know that.

439
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,779
And I'll help you. I'll show you.

440
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,932
It's a deal. I know.
You want to make this deal.

441
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,455
- You need this.
- Stop!

442
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:02,537
Fine.

443
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,533
But this cannot interfere with my work.

444
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,578
All right.

445
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,578
It's a deal.

446
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,732
You're going to get laid
this weekend, buddy.

447
00:27:22,449 --> 00:27:24,418
What are you doing?

448
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,377
Coop, what are you doing?

449
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:32,090
When William the Conqueror landed
on the English shores in 1066,

450
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:34,935
he had his invading army
destroy their own boats.

451
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,813
He wanted them to know
that there was no going back.

452
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:43,053
They were either going to conquer England
or they were going to die trying.

453
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,214
What's your point?

454
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,733
Ed, we're throwing away your porn.

455
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:53,097
I don't have any porn.

456
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:55,137
What makes you think I have porn?

457
00:27:56,449 --> 00:27:59,055
All right, I got a magazine lying around
somewhere maybe.

458
00:27:59,129 --> 00:28:02,053
I mean... Fine, we can throw that away.

459
00:28:02,129 --> 00:28:04,097
OK. OK.

460
00:28:04,969 --> 00:28:09,531
Well, at least this explains
why we spend 4,000 a month on tissues.

461
00:28:10,608 --> 00:28:11,973
Oh, check it out.

462
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:14,130
First targets of the day. Now, be cool.

463
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:16,132
Hey, ladies.

464
00:28:16,209 --> 00:28:19,497
What are two beautiful women like you
doing in a dump like this?

465
00:28:19,569 --> 00:28:21,058
We are throwing out the trash.

466
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:31,772
Well, I don't suppose.
Any of that turns you ladies on?

467
00:28:35,248 --> 00:28:36,739
Rug munchers.

468
00:28:36,808 --> 00:28:39,493
- I'll catch you later.
- Oh, hey, wait a minute, man.

469
00:28:39,568 --> 00:28:41,332
I thought we had a deal.

470
00:28:41,408 --> 00:28:43,649
The deal was it has to
fit around my schedule.

471
00:28:43,728 --> 00:28:47,016
Hey, and I completely stand by that,
but it is Saturday morning,

472
00:28:47,088 --> 00:28:49,055
the perfect time to pick up women, man.

473
00:28:49,128 --> 00:28:50,857
I mean, their defenses are down.

474
00:28:50,928 --> 00:28:53,272
I know a place where the
women are especially

475
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,615
vulnerable to our
licentious advances.

476
00:28:55,688 --> 00:28:57,815
"DAVID CHRISTIE: Saddle Up"

477
00:29:00,047 --> 00:29:02,016
And voila.

478
00:29:02,088 --> 00:29:05,250
Attractive single mothers
on a beautiful Saturday morning.

479
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:06,454
Are you kidding?

480
00:29:06,528 --> 00:29:08,974
As if single mothers
don't have enough to deal with,

481
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:11,015
they've got to be used and abused by you?

482
00:29:11,087 --> 00:29:13,567
Hey, us.
Single mothers are at their sexual peak.

483
00:29:13,647 --> 00:29:15,616
They don't have a man in their lives,

484
00:29:15,688 --> 00:29:17,633
and they can't find one
because they're busy

485
00:29:17,634 --> 00:29:19,579
looking after their
little ankle biter.

486
00:29:19,648 --> 00:29:21,810
We're doing them a favour.

487
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:23,855
Oh, there's one. Look.

488
00:29:23,927 --> 00:29:27,091
She's hot she's ripe,
and not a boyfriend in sight.

489
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:29,135
Come on, go, go, go, go.

490
00:29:29,207 --> 00:29:30,174
Ahem!

491
00:29:30,247 --> 00:29:32,215
Don't be nervous, though, OK?

492
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:34,369
If you have any questions, just say so.

493
00:29:34,447 --> 00:29:35,415
Hi.

494
00:29:35,487 --> 00:29:37,251
Hello, there.

495
00:29:38,287 --> 00:29:40,254
Do you like riding?

496
00:29:40,327 --> 00:29:42,978
Yeah, it's quite impressive.
What a beast, huh?

497
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:46,812
When l was a little boy,
l used to dream of having one like that.

498
00:29:49,807 --> 00:29:51,775
What, is it too big?

499
00:29:51,847 --> 00:29:54,168
Personally, I think the bigger the better.

500
00:29:55,206 --> 00:29:58,416
You know, it's fine as long as
you do some stretching beforehand.

501
00:29:58,487 --> 00:30:00,375
You look like you could handle that.

502
00:30:00,446 --> 00:30:02,130
You sick bastard!

503
00:30:02,206 --> 00:30:03,492
What? I'm just...

504
00:30:04,247 --> 00:30:06,487
No! No, I wasn't...

505
00:30:07,247 --> 00:30:08,896
- Don't...
- This man is a pervert!

506
00:30:11,526 --> 00:30:13,494
"WADE: Fall On Down"

507
00:30:14,566 --> 00:30:17,046
Those fat bastards will never get us!

508
00:30:17,126 --> 00:30:18,491
Yeah, right.

509
00:30:19,246 --> 00:30:22,217
"A million fishes left to fry"

510
00:30:23,286 --> 00:30:25,733
"And I fall on down"

511
00:30:25,806 --> 00:30:28,286
"I guess it's all the same tomorrow..."

512
00:30:29,326 --> 00:30:31,294
Come on. Get in.

513
00:30:31,366 --> 00:30:33,334
"I guess it's all the same tomorrow"

514
00:30:34,846 --> 00:30:37,417
I'm going
to have a heart attack.

515
00:30:38,885 --> 00:30:40,649
That was fun, huh, buddy?

516
00:30:40,725 --> 00:30:42,694
I don't know why we had to run away.

517
00:30:42,766 --> 00:30:45,212
I mean, we could have
just simply explained.

518
00:30:45,286 --> 00:30:47,368
Hey, you don't simply explain to cops, OK?

519
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:50,335
Especially when you're accused
of an alleged sex crime

520
00:30:50,405 --> 00:30:53,694
involving a horse cock
and a pretty little girl in powder blue.

521
00:30:53,765 --> 00:30:56,371
Running away doesn't make us look
any more innocent.

522
00:30:56,445 --> 00:30:58,050
All right, let's go.

523
00:30:58,125 --> 00:30:59,889
It's 12 o'clock.

524
00:30:59,965 --> 00:31:01,934
I haven't even thought about work.

525
00:31:02,006 --> 00:31:04,372
All right, I'm going to
see you at the... Oh!

526
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,174
What?

527
00:31:07,205 --> 00:31:09,094
What the fuck?

528
00:31:09,165 --> 00:31:11,054
That's Simone.

529
00:31:11,765 --> 00:31:14,894
The supermodel.
Her obituary was in the paper.

530
00:31:15,645 --> 00:31:18,250
Now, why would God take
the life of one so hot,

531
00:31:18,965 --> 00:31:22,936
when there are already so many ugly people
littering this planet?

532
00:31:23,005 --> 00:31:24,973
OK, come on, let's go.

533
00:31:25,045 --> 00:31:27,012
It's a damn shame, Ed.

534
00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:33,605
Holy steaming vagina kettle.

535
00:31:37,885 --> 00:31:39,852
Ed, you can't leave now.

536
00:31:39,925 --> 00:31:43,486
We have hot women,
depressed and in mourning.

537
00:31:44,204 --> 00:31:46,810
This is a once in a lifetime
opportunity for you, buddy.

538
00:31:46,884 --> 00:31:49,330
This is a church, and that's a funeral.

539
00:31:49,404 --> 00:31:51,168
Is nothing sacred to you?

540
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:52,928
Ed.

541
00:31:54,364 --> 00:31:57,334
Besides,
we're completely inappropriately dressed.

542
00:31:57,404 --> 00:31:59,372
"Organ plays"

543
00:32:04,324 --> 00:32:06,292
We're going to hell.

544
00:32:07,004 --> 00:32:09,245
An eternity of red-hot pokers up the ass.

545
00:32:09,324 --> 00:32:13,010
It's definitely worth the risk.
Will you look at all the ass in here?

546
00:32:14,164 --> 00:32:16,132
Oh, come here, child.

547
00:32:16,204 --> 00:32:18,172
Let the Church comfort you.

548
00:32:20,244 --> 00:32:21,894
Mmm!

549
00:32:23,204 --> 00:32:24,443
Oh.

550
00:32:24,524 --> 00:32:26,492
Excuse me.

551
00:32:29,764 --> 00:32:31,732
Were you close to the deceased?

552
00:32:31,803 --> 00:32:33,532
I was her lover.

553
00:32:33,603 --> 00:32:34,570
Oh.

554
00:32:34,644 --> 00:32:36,611
You drink from the furry cup.

555
00:32:37,724 --> 00:32:39,213
Do you like men, too?

556
00:32:39,283 --> 00:32:41,252
Haven't you taken a vow of celibacy?

557
00:32:41,324 --> 00:32:42,449
Oh, well...

558
00:32:42,523 --> 00:32:44,969
it's more of a guideline than a vow.

559
00:32:47,004 --> 00:32:48,971
Oh, excuse me.

560
00:32:49,043 --> 00:32:51,011
Maybe I'll baptise you later.

561
00:32:52,043 --> 00:32:54,011
We are here...

562
00:32:56,363 --> 00:32:58,012
Today is a...

563
00:33:02,603 --> 00:33:04,570
I'd like to...

564
00:33:13,163 --> 00:33:15,164
My voice. Would you mind?

565
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,008
- I don't think we...
- Oh, we'd be delighted, Father.

566
00:33:20,802 --> 00:33:22,885
- We can't do this.
- Hey, i 'am an actor.

567
00:33:22,962 --> 00:33:25,933
This is what i do.
They'll never know the difference.

568
00:33:27,362 --> 00:33:28,489
Shalom.

569
00:33:30,482 --> 00:33:32,929
Welcome to our church on this sad day.

570
00:33:33,642 --> 00:33:36,691
A day to celebrate the life of Simone.

571
00:33:36,762 --> 00:33:41,051
Anyone who knew Simone
knew that she was a beautiful woman.

572
00:33:42,082 --> 00:33:45,484
And I'm not just talking about in magazines
or on the internet.

573
00:33:46,202 --> 00:33:48,648
She was beautiful on the inside, too.

574
00:33:48,722 --> 00:33:51,566
I mean, her bone structure
was out of this world.

575
00:33:52,882 --> 00:33:57,365
But what lessons can we now take away
from Simone's short life?

576
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:03,572
To follow your dreams and to make each and
every moment count as if it was your last.

577
00:34:04,482 --> 00:34:06,007
Just as she did.

578
00:34:07,281 --> 00:34:10,126
And what also can we learn from her death?

579
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:14,483
If you're going to mix methamphetamine’s
and Kentucky bourbon,

580
00:34:14,562 --> 00:34:18,611
then don't drive the wrong way up an
off ramp into an oncoming 18-Wheeler.

581
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:21,251
"'Ominous..."

582
00:34:21,321 --> 00:34:22,812
"Vacuum..."

583
00:34:22,881 --> 00:34:27,808
"Indigenous scrotum"

584
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:32,485
"Amen"

585
00:34:34,641 --> 00:34:37,008
And a brief announcement before we depart.

586
00:34:37,081 --> 00:34:40,290
I will be giving, and receiving,

587
00:34:40,361 --> 00:34:44,207
one-on-one grief counselling in the
sacristy directly following the procession.

588
00:34:44,281 --> 00:34:46,249
Please stand.

589
00:34:48,401 --> 00:34:50,448
And let us go in peace,

590
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,489
to love and to serve the Lord.

591
00:34:57,441 --> 00:34:59,011
Coop, my wallet.

592
00:34:59,081 --> 00:35:02,051
- It's in the casket.
- We can't do anything about it now.

593
00:35:02,121 --> 00:35:03,690
Yeah, but... l'll...

594
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,402
We'll go to the cemetery after the burial,
when everyone's gone.

595
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,448
We'll ask them to open it up, OK?

596
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,328
Great plan.

597
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,725
I'm going to work,
where I should've been all day.

598
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,448
It's 5 p.m., and I've got nothing done.

599
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,568
Nothing? You've been meeting women.

600
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,608
I don't care about that.

601
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,127
In fact, I was pretty comfortable
in those priests' clothes.

602
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,728
I just want to save my career.

603
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,122
Maybe you'd do better at your job
if you just loosened up and got laid.

604
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,249
I'm going to the office
and I'm going to work all night.

605
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,005
And I'd appreciate it if you'd just let me
have that time to myself.

606
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,201
Sure.

607
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:49,008
Hey, whatever you need, bud.

608
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:52,367
Whatever makes you happy.
It is your birthday weekend. OK.

609
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,363
Hey, buddy.

610
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,801
Hey, I was thinking,
what if I brought some girls to the office?

611
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,246
Can you not get it through
your thick skull?

612
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:08,288
I don't care about getting laid.

613
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:10,123
Why? Are you gay?

614
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:13,965
You've never had a serious relationship,
so you wouldn't understand.

615
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:16,724
But me and Cathy,
what we had was something special.

616
00:36:17,439 --> 00:36:19,407
It was about so much more than sex.

617
00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:21,447
It was about a closeness.

618
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:24,170
It was about a Warmth that
we felt for each other.

619
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:27,721
There was nothing I wouldn't do for her,
or that she wouldn't do for me.

620
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:29,766
Because we cared about each other.

621
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:32,887
Ed, she videotaped herself
fucking your best friend.

622
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:34,927
Give me a break, man. It's over.

623
00:36:34,999 --> 00:36:35,807
No.

624
00:36:35,879 --> 00:36:38,563
She could be out there somewhere now
thinking about me.

625
00:36:38,638 --> 00:36:40,003
I doubt it, Ed.

626
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,046
Why? Is it because I'm so repulsive?

627
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:45,759
Am I such a... Am I so repugnant
that no-one wants to be with me?

628
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,488
No.

629
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:49,959
No, it's not that. It's just...

630
00:36:53,558 --> 00:36:55,606
Well, it looks like she's spoken for.

631
00:37:03,158 --> 00:37:04,922
Hey, I'm sorry, bud.

632
00:37:05,758 --> 00:37:07,123
You OK?

633
00:37:07,198 --> 00:37:08,848
Hey! Whoa, whoa!

634
00:37:08,918 --> 00:37:10,568
Whoa, Ed!

635
00:37:10,638 --> 00:37:11,969
Wait a minute!

636
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:15,239
We could at least act
like adults about this.

637
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:17,161
Take it easy. Let's go and sit down.

638
00:37:20,918 --> 00:37:22,282
Just...

639
00:37:23,038 --> 00:37:25,962
I just really thought
we were going to get back together.

640
00:37:26,038 --> 00:37:28,005
You know, I thought she was the one.

641
00:37:28,077 --> 00:37:30,239
Well, that's where you're going wrong, Ed.

642
00:37:30,317 --> 00:37:32,797
I mean, you can't think
about meeting the one.

643
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:35,688
You need to start thinking about
meeting the ones.

644
00:37:36,678 --> 00:37:38,840
I mean, meeting women is a numbers game.

645
00:37:38,917 --> 00:37:40,885
You think I get laid a lot, and I do,

646
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:44,598
but l only sleep with a tiny percentage
of the women l actually talk to.

647
00:37:45,357 --> 00:37:47,644
I mean, I'll talk to 30 women in a night.

648
00:37:47,717 --> 00:37:49,685
And if one fucks me, I'm doing well,

649
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:52,405
You? You talk to two women in a month.

650
00:37:52,477 --> 00:37:54,662
And if neither fucks you,
you scamper back into

651
00:37:54,663 --> 00:37:56,845
your little shell and
feel sorry for yourself.

652
00:37:56,917 --> 00:37:59,568
Tell me how it works.
I mean, make it work for me.

653
00:37:59,637 --> 00:38:01,605
You were right. Get me laid.

654
00:38:01,676 --> 00:38:04,248
That's the only way I'm
going to get over this.

655
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:06,399
What about your job?

656
00:38:10,757 --> 00:38:12,724
I will work tomorrow all day,

657
00:38:13,437 --> 00:38:15,803
but tonight, I just
really need to have sex.

658
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,686
Will you help me?

659
00:38:25,756 --> 00:38:27,485
Go on, girl!

660
00:38:28,237 --> 00:38:30,238
"RELISH: Karma Calling"

661
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,566
"Come on you beautiful thing..."

662
00:38:34,276 --> 00:38:36,438
"Take me to the city that you live in"

663
00:38:36,516 --> 00:38:38,360
I don't know if this is such a good idea.

664
00:38:38,436 --> 00:38:40,757
Are you crazy? This is a perfect idea.

665
00:38:40,836 --> 00:38:42,440
Look at all the hot chicks, man.

666
00:38:42,516 --> 00:38:46,362
I'm going to keep bringing girls around
here until you find one you like, OK?

667
00:38:46,436 --> 00:38:49,599
Then tickle, tickle, pinch, pinch.
Know what I'm talking about?

668
00:38:49,676 --> 00:38:51,678
So just sit back, relax, and have fun.

669
00:38:54,195 --> 00:38:56,324
Hey hey!

670
00:38:56,395 --> 00:38:58,636
God, I've never wanted to be a gun more
in my life.

671
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:01,518
Whoa!

672
00:39:03,556 --> 00:39:05,046
Yeah!

673
00:39:05,115 --> 00:39:08,756
I'm don't know if I really feel
that comfortable glorifying war.

674
00:39:08,836 --> 00:39:10,041
I am.

675
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:11,641
Oh, thank you.

676
00:39:15,755 --> 00:39:18,235
Takes you back, doesn't it? Oh, man!

677
00:39:19,476 --> 00:39:21,443
Oh, yeah!

678
00:39:21,515 --> 00:39:23,722
It is graduation day, brother.

679
00:39:25,555 --> 00:39:27,523
Jesus Christ?

680
00:39:28,395 --> 00:39:31,160
Holy shit, woman.
Haven't you ever heard of waxing?

681
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:32,964
"BOSSHOUSE: You're Gonna Lose"

682
00:39:34,795 --> 00:39:36,763
Oh, yes!

683
00:39:37,595 --> 00:39:40,485
It's Uncle Sam's daughter. Outstanding!

684
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:43,877
Oh, my God, and look at those tits.

685
00:39:45,915 --> 00:39:47,883
God bless America, man.

686
00:39:49,995 --> 00:39:52,566
I don't know if I'm feeling
all that patriotic.

687
00:39:52,635 --> 00:39:55,320
You're fucking crazy, man.
Here. Pay the woman.

688
00:39:59,434 --> 00:40:02,803
"And now, I know, whatever you do,
you're gonna lose"

689
00:40:02,874 --> 00:40:04,842
No, honey, tuck it in the top.

690
00:40:04,915 --> 00:40:06,882
"I'm way ahead of you.”

691
00:40:07,955 --> 00:40:09,719
Owww!

692
00:40:09,795 --> 00:40:11,081
What? What?

693
00:40:11,155 --> 00:40:13,122
Ow!

694
00:40:13,194 --> 00:40:15,162
Oh, real cool, fellows. Come on.

695
00:40:15,234 --> 00:40:18,875
You know she's got more to worry about
than paper cuts down there.

696
00:40:18,954 --> 00:40:21,099
Hey, this doesn't happen
in Japan, my friend.

697
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,243
It really doesn't.
Thoroughly angry.

698
00:40:23,314 --> 00:40:26,284
Ed, did you see the reaction
you got out of that woman?

699
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:28,322
Phenomenal! Great start, buddy.

700
00:40:28,394 --> 00:40:30,681
That in there, that's not
what I'm looking for.

701
00:40:30,754 --> 00:40:32,916
Have you ever heard the expression,

702
00:40:32,994 --> 00:40:35,695
"Give a man a fish and
he'll eat for a day, but

703
00:40:35,696 --> 00:40:38,397
teach a man to fish and
he'll eat forever“?

704
00:40:38,474 --> 00:40:40,157
You want to learn how to fish?

705
00:40:40,234 --> 00:40:41,201
No.

706
00:40:41,274 --> 00:40:43,845
I want to learn how to
pick up a woman legitimately.

707
00:40:43,914 --> 00:40:46,440
I don't want to have to pay someone
to sleep with me.

708
00:40:46,514 --> 00:40:48,481
I know, buddy. I know.

709
00:40:48,553 --> 00:40:51,602
I'll teach you how.
I'll teach you how to pick up women.

710
00:40:51,674 --> 00:40:53,438
I'm your bro. You can count on me.

711
00:40:53,514 --> 00:40:54,924
You got tonight only.

712
00:40:54,993 --> 00:40:58,042
Well, not laid tonight only,
but l want you to teach me.

713
00:40:58,113 --> 00:41:01,754
Tonight is your night. I mean, it's
your birthday weekend, get it going.

714
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,598
I'm the student. You're the Sensi.

715
00:41:03,673 --> 00:41:06,358
I will snow you the path
to vagina enlightenment.

716
00:41:18,153 --> 00:41:21,123
Excuse me. You're putting your
whites in with your colours.

717
00:41:21,192 --> 00:41:22,604
Is that bad?

718
00:41:22,673 --> 00:41:25,802
Well, it is if you don't want all
your whites coming out pink.

719
00:41:25,873 --> 00:41:27,840
Oh, really?

720
00:41:27,913 --> 00:41:29,881
I'm such a moron.

721
00:41:35,953 --> 00:41:36,953
..Do my own laundry.

722
00:41:37,032 --> 00:41:39,001
You were in Somalia?

723
00:41:39,073 --> 00:41:41,155
I would love to talk to you about that.

724
00:41:42,953 --> 00:41:44,920
Let me help you.

725
00:41:55,713 --> 00:42:00,274
And that is why Aids is a clear example
of God punishing the blacks and the gays.

726
00:42:02,232 --> 00:42:05,281
- Tell me, do you...
- Don't even get me started on the Jews.

727
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,353
Ooh!

728
00:42:09,432 --> 00:42:11,196
That's me done.

729
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:15,472
- Got to go.
- Well, ehh...

730
00:42:15,552 --> 00:42:17,156
Want to get a drink or something?

731
00:42:17,231 --> 00:42:19,200
I'd love to. Ed?

732
00:42:21,191 --> 00:42:24,913
I don't see how the gym's going to be
any better than the Laundromat.

733
00:42:25,631 --> 00:42:30,432
Well, we got tumble dryers on low,
or big, sweaty, bouncing tits in a leotard.

734
00:42:31,472 --> 00:42:34,918
Oh, my God, look at her
I bet she uses Kamasutra as a cool down.

735
00:42:35,791 --> 00:42:38,079
All right. You're up, iron man. Go get her.

736
00:42:39,111 --> 00:42:41,160
Come on, on the treadmill. Go, go, go.

737
00:42:47,471 --> 00:42:48,518
Aagh!

738
00:42:53,551 --> 00:42:56,031
Tough break, bro, but you know what?
No worries.

739
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,352
You know what women love
more than anything?

740
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:01,082
Men with babies. We're going to get a baby.

741
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:07,361
Let's skip the babies.

742
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:10,673
Yeah, good idea.
I don't know anything about babies, anyway.

743
00:43:10,751 --> 00:43:13,834
- Come on. I got a better idea.
- Watch it, I tore my sack.

744
00:43:13,911 --> 00:43:15,675
Beggars can't be choosers, buddy.

745
00:43:15,751 --> 00:43:18,641
And stay positive, Ed.
We're doing great here, man.

746
00:43:18,711 --> 00:43:20,712
I'm not sure about this.

747
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:23,158
Check her out.
Look how she works that olive.

748
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:27,313
That's fantastic.
You want to get laid, don't you?

749
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:29,481
Not that badly.

750
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,240
Dude, dude. Here.

751
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,199
Here 's your chance. Go.

752
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:36,637
Go. Light her cigarette. Go. Be suave.

753
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:41,156
Can I offer you a light?

754
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:43,198
A gentleman.

755
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:45,352
You're a rare breed.

756
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,355
Sorry.

757
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:03,475
You a Scotch drinker? I bet you are.

758
00:44:03,549 --> 00:44:05,518
Ooh, ooh!

759
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:08,196
Have you ever been to Japan?

760
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:11,034
Okinawa? No? Oh, it's beautiful there.

761
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:13,350
Ifs a lot like this. You could Wear that.

762
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:15,194
Maybe Tahiti, something like that?

763
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:17,034
Are you ticklish?

764
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:18,156
Put it out!

765
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:20,197
Good as new. Good as new.

766
00:44:21,429 --> 00:44:23,397
Can I buy you another drink?

767
00:44:31,709 --> 00:44:34,280
That's it, I'm done. I'm done.

768
00:44:34,349 --> 00:44:36,316
I scraped the bottom of the barrel,

769
00:44:37,749 --> 00:44:39,990
and the bottom of the barrel rejected me.

770
00:44:42,949 --> 00:44:45,031
All right. Ifs time for a stiff drink.

771
00:44:45,988 --> 00:44:47,957
Go home. Get a good night's sleep.

772
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:51,030
Wake up in the morning and work like a dog.

773
00:44:56,389 --> 00:44:59,517
Thanks, Randy. Appreciate it.
Keep them coming, will you?

787
00:45:50,588 --> 00:45:51,953
No, thanks.

788
00:45:57,628 --> 00:45:58,833
I'm kidding.

789
00:46:00,347 --> 00:46:02,315
I 'll have a Cosmopolitan.

790
00:46:03,387 --> 00:46:05,355
And a Cosmopolitan for the lady.

791
00:46:06,467 --> 00:46:09,391
So... what brings you here?

792
00:46:10,187 --> 00:46:12,269
My brother's ehm...

793
00:46:12,347 --> 00:46:14,190
Gone. Nice.

794
00:46:14,907 --> 00:46:16,989
You? What brings you here?

795
00:46:17,067 --> 00:46:18,228
My date.

796
00:46:20,507 --> 00:46:22,475
But it looks like he stood me up.

797
00:46:23,267 --> 00:46:25,348
He's an idiot if he has.

798
00:46:25,427 --> 00:46:27,110
Thanks.

799
00:46:28,667 --> 00:46:30,953
Hey. Here's to bad dates.

800
00:46:32,587 --> 00:46:34,554
You had some?

801
00:46:34,627 --> 00:46:36,595
Some? I've had them all.

802
00:46:37,867 --> 00:46:39,949
Dating should be outlawed.

803
00:46:40,027 --> 00:46:40,994
Amen.

804
00:46:41,066 --> 00:46:43,637
They should just bring
back arranged marriages.

805
00:46:43,706 --> 00:46:45,709
Couldn't raise the divorce
rate much higher.

806
00:46:45,787 --> 00:46:49,871
If we women didn't have to bother
trying to find, meet and attract men,

807
00:46:49,946 --> 00:46:52,233
it would free up, what, 50 hours a week?

808
00:46:52,307 --> 00:46:53,273
Easily.

809
00:46:53,346 --> 00:46:57,192
And imagine what you women could achieve
with that kind of extra time.

810
00:46:57,266 --> 00:47:00,315
Are you kidding?
There'd be a Bloomingdale's on Mars.

811
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:04,587
"Build a house where we can stay"

812
00:47:04,666 --> 00:47:06,031
"Build..."

813
00:47:06,106 --> 00:47:08,507
To being friends and nothing more.

814
00:47:09,946 --> 00:47:11,516
Ditto.

815
00:47:18,225 --> 00:47:20,274
You live here?

816
00:47:20,346 --> 00:47:21,916
Temporarily.

817
00:47:21,986 --> 00:47:24,227
My apartment is being repainted.

818
00:47:24,306 --> 00:47:26,274
I hope your apartment done soon.

819
00:47:27,306 --> 00:47:29,273
Damn it I'm out of coffee, Ed.

820
00:47:30,105 --> 00:47:32,267
That's OK.
Coffee would keep me up all night.

821
00:47:35,305 --> 00:47:38,388
Will this... keep you up all night?

- Stop! Police!
- I'm arresting you for soliciting.

830
00:48:07,304 --> 00:48:09,114
Are you crazy? She's not a prostitute.

831
00:48:09,185 --> 00:48:12,189
Wait outside for ten... three minutes,

832
00:48:12,904 --> 00:48:15,555
and... maybe we can work something out.

833
00:48:16,785 --> 00:48:21,029
There's been some sort of misunderstanding.
I'm not supposed to be in here.

834
00:48:22,905 --> 00:48:24,872
Me too.

835
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:28,074
This is a miscarriage of justice.

836
00:48:28,145 --> 00:48:30,273
They said I was drunk.

837
00:48:31,064 --> 00:48:33,305
If I was drunk,

838
00:48:34,064 --> 00:48:36,874
my breath would smell of booze.

839
00:48:37,704 --> 00:48:39,308
How does my breath smell?

840
00:48:44,024 --> 00:48:46,948
I'm here to bail out my brother, Ed Waxman.

841
00:48:48,824 --> 00:48:51,111
Fill in these forms.

842
00:48:56,344 --> 00:48:58,312

00:48:59,224 --> 00:49:01,226
Shit, Cooper, please hurry.

00:49:01,304 --> 00:49:03,989
Well, you know, in Japan,
I'm like Brad Pitt.

845
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,628
Seriously.

846
00:49:06,703 --> 00:49:08,671
You smell nice.

847
00:49:10,144 --> 00:49:11,713
Hey, you like sushi?

848
00:49:11,784 --> 00:49:13,945
I bet you fuck like a bunny.

849
00:49:15,543 --> 00:49:18,228
Keep those cuffs when you're off duty?

850
00:49:18,303 --> 00:49:21,069
Faraday. Don't you have
some crimes to solve?

851
00:49:21,143 --> 00:49:23,111
Sorry, sir.

852
00:49:27,103 --> 00:49:29,754
Brad Pitt, you done with those forms yet?

853
00:49:31,063 --> 00:49:33,031
There you go, my good sir.

854
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:36,107
Now, why don't you go be a peach
and get my brother out of there?

855
00:49:37,863 --> 00:49:39,433
I'll be outside.

856
00:49:44,382 --> 00:49:46,351
Is there an Ed Waxman here?

857
00:49:46,423 --> 00:49:48,390
Your bail's been posted.

858
00:49:48,463 --> 00:49:50,112
I'm Ed Waxman.

859
00:49:50,183 --> 00:49:51,992
Did you come in with any ID?

860
00:49:52,063 --> 00:49:54,030
- No, I lost my wallet.
- Really?

861
00:49:54,102 --> 00:49:56,549
I can assure you I'm Ed Waxman.
Just let me out.

862
00:49:56,622 --> 00:49:58,591
Oh, stop.

863
00:50:00,142 --> 00:50:02,111
I am Ed Waxman.

864
00:50:02,183 --> 00:50:03,514
That's bullshit.

865
00:50:03,582 --> 00:50:04,993
- Bullshit.
- Can you prove it?

866
00:50:05,062 --> 00:50:07,713
Of course he can't prove it.
He's not Ed Waxman.

867
00:50:07,782 --> 00:50:09,750
I prefer Edward, actually.

868
00:50:10,462 --> 00:50:12,112
And here's the proof.

869
00:50:14,142 --> 00:50:15,383
Out you come.

870
00:50:15,462 --> 00:50:16,907
Stand back from the door.

871
00:50:16,982 --> 00:50:19,553
He's wearing my shirt! I had it on.

872
00:50:19,622 --> 00:50:23,263
I wear an undershirt all the time,
and I don't have one on right now.

873
00:50:23,342 --> 00:50:25,310
That's the shirt I wiped my ass with.

874
00:50:25,382 --> 00:50:27,146
I had Mexican food?

875
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:33,226
Here's your brother.

876
00:50:33,302 --> 00:50:35,270
Where?

877
00:50:36,302 --> 00:50:37,463
There.

878
00:50:38,621 --> 00:50:40,067
That's not my brother.

879
00:50:40,821 --> 00:50:42,506
Well, he was positively ID'd.

880
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,550
Well, you released the wrong guy.

881
00:50:45,581 --> 00:50:47,550
Now go inside and get my brother.

882
00:50:47,622 --> 00:50:49,305
There's nothing more I can do.

883
00:50:49,382 --> 00:50:53,466
Come back in the morning and sort it out
with the Lieutenant. Night, night.

884
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,392
Where are you taking me?

885
00:51:05,461 --> 00:51:07,430
I'm taking you to an overnight cell.

886
00:51:08,341 --> 00:51:10,309
- Come here, bitch.
- I can't...

887
00:51:10,381 --> 00:51:13,032
- Hey, cocksucker!
- ..Spend the night in here.

888
00:51:13,101 --> 00:51:14,068
Sweetmeat.

889
00:51:14,141 --> 00:51:17,304
Well, it ain't the Holiday Inn, but...

890
00:51:18,981 --> 00:51:20,949
No, it's er...

891
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:23,388
That's great. Thanks.

892
00:51:23,461 --> 00:51:25,064
Who is this guy?

893
00:51:25,141 --> 00:51:27,109
Some jerk that got caught with a pro.

894
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,149
Feel sorry for him.

895
00:51:30,181 --> 00:51:32,149
I know you from somewhere.

896
00:51:32,221 --> 00:51:34,222
No, I don't think so.

897
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,950
You're the pervert!

898
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,388
- What?
- You were at the park this morning.

899
00:51:38,461 --> 00:51:39,701
Propositioned a woman.

900
00:51:39,781 --> 00:51:42,307
Apparently he gets turned on
by horse erections.

901
00:51:42,381 --> 00:51:44,110
When I approached the suspect, he ran.

902
00:51:44,181 --> 00:51:45,591
Did you do that?

903
00:51:46,341 --> 00:51:48,866
Well, I ran away, but it
wasn't because of the...

904
00:51:48,941 --> 00:51:50,908
All right! I've heard enough.

905
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,345
No, but...

906
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:53,786
Pervert

907
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,788
I'm not a pervert! Come on.

908
00:51:56,861 --> 00:51:58,828
I'm not a pervert!

909
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:06,187
Hello.

910
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,584
What are you in for?

911
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:11,106
I had a misunderstanding with a prostitute.

912
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:12,989
I didn't even...

913
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:15,222
I was... What are you in for?

914
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:18,631
Biggest black market
Viagra dealer in America.

915
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,144
Oh.

916
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:22,301
But their case doesn't stand a chance.

917
00:52:22,379 --> 00:52:25,781
I managed to swallow most of my stash
before they could impound it.

918
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,309
You look nervous.

919
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:37,823
- You nervous?
- No.

920
00:52:40,659 --> 00:52:42,741
There is no reason we can't be friends.

921
00:52:43,779 --> 00:52:45,941
You look like a reasonable individual.

922
00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:50,229
So there's no reason to be nervous, because
we just got to respect each other's space.

923
00:52:50,299 --> 00:52:51,664
The personal boundaries.

924
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:53,707
The... The space. The boundaries.

925
00:52:53,778 --> 00:52:55,941
The per... The personal boundaries.

926
00:52:56,019 --> 00:52:57,987
Cooper Cooper.

927
00:52:58,059 --> 00:53:00,027
Cooper.

928
00:53:05,419 --> 00:53:06,830
OK Waxman.

929
00:53:09,699 --> 00:53:11,667
You're being released.

930
00:53:16,218 --> 00:53:18,187
Tray saved your ass this time, huh?

931
00:53:18,259 --> 00:53:20,226
Work. Got to go to work.

932
00:53:20,299 --> 00:53:22,063
Jesus, man.

933
00:53:22,139 --> 00:53:24,106
You're in no shape to go to the office.

934
00:53:24,178 --> 00:53:25,384
Come on.

935
00:53:25,458 --> 00:53:27,826
You can come with me on
a little car ride, OK?

936
00:53:27,899 --> 00:53:29,866
Come on. Watch your dome, there.

937
00:53:29,938 --> 00:53:31,906
Oh. Ed, watch your head.

938
00:53:31,978 --> 00:53:33,946
Come on. Get in there.

939
00:53:34,738 --> 00:53:37,742
Get in there. There you go, buddy.
Hold on to that.

940
00:53:42,618 --> 00:53:44,984
So, how'd you get arrested
in the first place?

941
00:53:45,058 --> 00:53:46,981
I still don't understand it.

942
00:53:47,058 --> 00:53:48,423
I met a nice girl.

943
00:53:48,497 --> 00:53:52,344
She invites me back to her place,
and it turns out she's a prostitute.

944
00:53:54,217 --> 00:53:56,186
What, did she ask you for money?

945
00:53:56,258 --> 00:53:58,022
No. That's the weird part.

946
00:53:58,097 --> 00:54:00,862
I thought you got the financial bit
out of the way first.

947
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:03,508
Yeah, yeah.
That's the way I've always done it.

948
00:54:07,897 --> 00:54:09,501
Do you know what this means?

949
00:54:09,577 --> 00:54:10,739
What?

950
00:54:10,817 --> 00:54:12,468
She was off duty.

951
00:54:12,537 --> 00:54:14,301
She must've really liked you.

952
00:54:14,377 --> 00:54:17,102
Ed, a prostitute that's
willing to give it away

953
00:54:17,103 --> 00:54:19,827
for free is worth at
least two normal girls.

954
00:54:19,898 --> 00:54:21,467
- Really?
- Hell, yeah, man!

955
00:54:21,537 --> 00:54:23,505
You are a stud, my friend.

956
00:54:23,577 --> 00:54:25,545
A total stud.

957
00:54:26,737 --> 00:54:29,343
And that Kim... God, was she nectar, huh?

958
00:54:29,417 --> 00:54:31,385
She was hot. She really was.

959
00:54:31,457 --> 00:54:33,425
I mean, you should have seen...

960
00:54:35,017 --> 00:54:36,781
How'd you know her name?

961
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:38,302
You told me.

962
00:54:38,376 --> 00:54:39,902
No, I didn't.

963
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:42,025
So how did you know her name was Kim?

964
00:54:42,776 --> 00:54:44,745
Well, she looked like a Kim.

965
00:54:44,817 --> 00:54:46,865
I mean, she had very Kimesque features.

966
00:54:46,937 --> 00:54:49,702
You paid her, didn't you?
You paid her in advance.

967
00:54:49,776 --> 00:54:51,825
That's why she didn't ask for the money.

968
00:54:51,897 --> 00:54:54,423
No, I didn't. Hey, Ed, that's ludicrous!

969
00:54:54,497 --> 00:54:56,305
I was trying to build your self-esteem.

970
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,561
Am I so pathetic that a
woman's not going to

971
00:54:58,562 --> 00:55:00,745
sleep with me without
financial incentive?

972
00:55:00,816 --> 00:55:02,785
Come on. That's not what I meant.

973
00:55:02,856 --> 00:55:04,824
Listen, you and I both know

974
00:55:04,897 --> 00:55:07,661
someday we'll look at this
as brothers and laugh.

975
00:55:07,736 --> 00:55:10,899
You shitbag! Do you have any
idea what I've been through?

976
00:55:10,976 --> 00:55:13,217
I was just trying to help.

977
00:55:13,297 --> 00:55:14,457
Help?

978
00:55:16,096 --> 00:55:18,383
Help? You helped me get
a criminal record...

979
00:55:18,456 --> 00:55:23,223
when all I wanted to do
was go to the office and save my career.

980
00:55:24,656 --> 00:55:26,545
And now that's gone, too.

981
00:55:26,616 --> 00:55:28,265
I should have never listened to you.

982
00:55:28,336 --> 00:55:29,303
Why...

983
00:55:32,175 --> 00:55:35,066
Ed, I think we need to
take a little breath here.

984
00:55:35,136 --> 00:55:36,706
I mean, it's just a job.

985
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:41,107
At least I've had a job
in my lifetime, Coop.

986
00:55:41,176 --> 00:55:43,143
You've accomplished nothing.

987
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:44,183
Nothing?

988
00:55:44,256 --> 00:55:47,817
Ed, in Japan, this is
the eighth-most-recognised Western face.

989
00:55:47,896 --> 00:55:51,581
And one day they're going to replace
that face, and you'll have nothing.

990
00:55:51,655 --> 00:55:53,225
And you'll be nothing.

991
00:55:53,295 --> 00:55:55,264
Because you've tried nothing.

992
00:55:56,495 --> 00:55:58,020
Hey, well, fuck you!

993
00:56:01,135 --> 00:56:03,297
Oh, shit. I'm sorry, Ed.

994
00:56:04,175 --> 00:56:05,142
Fuck.

995
00:56:05,215 --> 00:56:07,058
Just leave me alone.

996
00:56:09,455 --> 00:56:11,822
- Hey, Ed, what are you doing?
- Going home.

997
00:56:11,895 --> 00:56:15,183
I really think somebody
should take a look at that cut, man.

998
00:56:15,255 --> 00:56:17,542
You know what? I don't care what you think.

999
00:56:17,615 --> 00:56:21,221
All right? I'm really serious right now.
I don't want to see your face.

1000
00:56:26,815 --> 00:56:28,783
Hey, Ed. Let's talk about this, man.

1001
00:56:28,855 --> 00:56:30,822
Hey, don't walk away.

1002
00:56:30,894 --> 00:56:32,863
I'm sorry you didn't get laid, man.

1003
00:56:32,935 --> 00:56:35,905
I'm sorry nobody wanted to sleep with you.
Come back!

1004
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:37,942
Hey, fuck Jo and Susie.

1005
00:56:38,014 --> 00:56:39,778
I know Rachel and Cassie.

1006
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:41,982
Those chicks will fuck
you at the same time!

1007
00:56:44,614 --> 00:56:46,582
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

1008
00:56:48,934 --> 00:56:50,858
All I have is $1.05.

1009
00:56:50,934 --> 00:56:52,095
Wow.

1010
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:53,664
It's a $1.10.

1011
00:56:53,734 --> 00:56:56,579
Yes, but all I have is $1.05.

1012
00:56:56,654 --> 00:57:00,136
So if you could cut me some slack,
I'd really appreciate that,

1013
00:57:00,214 --> 00:57:02,216
because I spent last night in prison.

1014
00:57:03,454 --> 00:57:07,618
Oh, so you'd like special treatment
because you're a felon?

1015
00:57:07,694 --> 00:57:10,663
I will come back tomorrow
with the difference.

1016
00:57:10,734 --> 00:57:11,973
Twice the difference.

1017
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:13,737
It doesn't work like that.

1018
00:57:14,613 --> 00:57:16,104
I want to go home.

1019
00:57:16,174 --> 00:57:20,099
Well, unless you've got $1.10,
you ain't going nowhere.

1020
00:57:22,174 --> 00:57:24,415
What is wrong with you people?

1021
00:57:24,494 --> 00:57:26,258
I pay my taxes!

1022
00:57:27,013 --> 00:57:28,982
I don't throw trash on the street.

1023
00:57:29,053 --> 00:57:31,500
I don't piss in alleyways
or graffiti walls!

1024
00:57:31,574 --> 00:57:34,657
I don't even have children
in the public school system.

1025
00:57:34,733 --> 00:57:38,294
I recycle my glass, my paper, my plastics.

1026
00:57:38,373 --> 00:57:42,014
I'm a good person, and I
just want a bus token.

1027
00:57:42,813 --> 00:57:44,338
Bye.

1028
00:57:45,973 --> 00:57:47,941
That's it? That's it?

1029
00:57:48,773 --> 00:57:50,741
If I'm not going home, no-one is!

1030
00:57:54,933 --> 00:57:56,901
You just can't keep out of trouble.

1031
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,623
Fuck! Where did you come from?

1032
00:57:58,693 --> 00:57:59,979
Yes!

1033
00:58:00,052 --> 00:58:02,420
This is a perfect ending
to a perfect weekend.

1034
00:58:02,493 --> 00:58:04,621
I'm arresting you for disturbing the peace.

1035
00:58:04,693 --> 00:58:06,660
I just want a bus token.

1036
00:58:06,732 --> 00:58:08,098
And for begging.

1037
00:58:08,173 --> 00:58:09,618
Here you go.

1038
00:58:12,133 --> 00:58:13,373
Do you know this guy?

1039
00:58:13,453 --> 00:58:15,615
We live in the same apartment building.

1040
00:58:15,693 --> 00:58:17,217
I'll take him home.

1041
00:58:18,813 --> 00:58:20,497
All right.

1042
00:58:20,573 --> 00:58:22,540
- Lf you're sure.
- Mm-hm.

1043
00:58:30,692 --> 00:58:32,660
Are you OK?

1044
00:58:33,812 --> 00:58:34,779
Yeah.

1045
00:58:39,372 --> 00:58:41,340
Go on, now. Blow.

1046
00:58:41,412 --> 00:58:43,733
Come on.

1047
00:58:46,372 --> 00:58:47,338
Eugh

1048
00:58:47,412 --> 00:58:49,061
I'm sorry.

1049
00:58:49,132 --> 00:58:54,218
It's been a hell of a 48 hours and l guess
it all just got a little on top of me.

1050
00:58:55,052 --> 00:58:57,658
So what's happened,
if you don't mind my asking?

1051
00:59:00,172 --> 00:59:01,936
I haven't had sex in over a year.

1052
00:59:02,731 --> 00:59:04,460
Well, I can see how that would...

1053
00:59:04,531 --> 00:59:07,580
And my ex, who I was really hoping
to get back together with...

1054
00:59:08,292 --> 00:59:10,532
- got married.
- That is just...

1055
00:59:10,611 --> 00:59:14,536
I got arrested last night
for picking up a prostitute.

1056
00:59:18,131 --> 00:59:20,100
I didn't know she was a prostitute.

1057
00:59:20,171 --> 00:59:23,015
- Well, no wonder you're just...
- And because of that,

1058
00:59:23,091 --> 00:59:26,777
I spent the night in a prison cell
fending off the amorous advances

1059
00:59:26,851 --> 00:59:30,742
of a very giant man with a pierced scrotum.

1060
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,179
Must be more dead animals about.

1061
00:59:51,491 --> 00:59:53,573
- You can fart on command?
- You can't?

1062
00:59:54,611 --> 00:59:56,578
I tried once, but just shat myself.

1063
00:59:57,330 --> 00:59:59,298
It's not something you try twice.

1064
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:03,419
- Whoa. It's a big cat.
- Yeah.

1065
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:08,298
- I hope the door opens soon.
- Yeah.

1066
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:15,538
Uh, thanks for the bus token.

1067
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:18,375
I'm feeling a lot... saner now.

1068
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:20,418
Has anyone looked at that?

1069
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:22,535
It'll heal.

1070
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:24,578
Come on. It looks really nasty.

1071
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:27,017
I got some antiseptic stuff and a Band-Aid.

1072
01:00:27,089 --> 01:00:28,660
Come on.

1073
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:34,097
Wow. Those are great.

1074
01:00:34,169 --> 01:00:36,138
Who are they by?

1075
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:39,452
A little known contemporary photographer,
Ellen Reece.

1076
01:00:40,209 --> 01:00:42,178
She's very talented.

1077
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:44,217
Why, thank you.

1078
01:00:45,889 --> 01:00:47,653
- Ellen?
- Yeah.

1079
01:00:47,729 --> 01:00:49,698
I'm sorry. I never asked your name.

1080
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:51,737
- I'm Ed Waxman.
- Hi.

1081
01:00:53,089 --> 01:00:55,058
You do this professionally?

1082
01:00:55,129 --> 01:00:57,097
I do now.

1083
01:00:57,170 --> 01:01:01,254
I was a model for a long time, but I quit
to spend more time behind the camera.

1084
01:01:01,329 --> 01:01:03,297
That's very brave.

1085
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:05,337
Not really.

1086
01:01:05,409 --> 01:01:07,673
You're not brave to do what
you really want to do.

1087
01:01:07,674 --> 01:01:09,938
You're just an idiot
if you don't.

1088
01:01:10,009 --> 01:01:11,579
Do you want a BLT?

1089
01:01:12,289 --> 01:01:14,451
I am so hungry. Yes, please.

1090
01:01:17,649 --> 01:01:19,616
You never told me what you do.

1091
01:01:19,689 --> 01:01:21,134
Advertising.

1092
01:01:22,169 --> 01:01:24,409
You definitely getting fired tomorrow?

1093
01:01:24,488 --> 01:01:25,854
Yep.

1094
01:01:26,608 --> 01:01:29,135
"MY LITTLE DOG CHINA:
then You Know They're Wrong"

1095
01:01:31,008 --> 01:01:32,977
"You call to me"

1096
01:01:33,409 --> 01:01:35,138
"When your friends steer you wrong"

1097
01:01:35,888 --> 01:01:37,493
"And you treat them like an angel..."

1098
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:40,651
I was planning on working this weekend.
Really buckling down.

1099
01:01:40,728 --> 01:01:44,495
But I got sidetracked by my brother's
futile attempt to get me laid.

1100
01:01:45,208 --> 01:01:48,929
You could say the only thing
that got fucked this weekend was my career.

1101
01:01:49,648 --> 01:01:50,979
Sorry to hear it.

1102
01:01:51,049 --> 01:01:54,894
"Just act like they're right
when you know they're wrong"

1103
01:01:54,969 --> 01:01:56,430
"Just act like they're
right when you know..."

1104
01:01:56,431 --> 01:01:57,892
- Hold on. Ed!

1105
01:01:57,968 --> 01:01:59,413
Ed, Ed.

1106
01:01:59,488 --> 01:02:00,853
Sorry.

1107
01:02:00,928 --> 01:02:02,851
I thought you were someone else.

1108
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:06,216
You know, i'm...
I'm just not good with the women.

1109
01:02:07,008 --> 01:02:08,976
I'm not like my brother Cooper.

1110
01:02:09,047 --> 01:02:10,333
Thank God.

1111
01:02:10,407 --> 01:02:11,295
What?

1112
01:02:11,368 --> 01:02:14,531
That guy is the most self-centred,
shallow person I've ever met.

1113
01:02:17,688 --> 01:02:19,212
Have you seen this man?

1114
01:02:19,288 --> 01:02:20,733
"I know it hurts."

1115
01:02:20,808 --> 01:02:22,810
- Uh-uh.
- No?

1116
01:02:23,848 --> 01:02:25,418
OK.

1117
01:02:26,328 --> 01:02:27,977
How about that man?

1118
01:02:28,047 --> 01:02:30,209
- Uh-uh.
- Thanks.

1119
01:02:32,647 --> 01:02:36,618
Do not think that Cooper is the ideal man
that all women are looking for.

1120
01:02:37,447 --> 01:02:41,497
To be honest, I think it's a bit sad that
a guy needs to have constant reassurance

1121
01:02:41,567 --> 01:02:43,331
that he's desirable.

1122
01:02:43,407 --> 01:02:45,409
It's a massive sign of insecurity.

1123
01:02:47,488 --> 01:02:49,455
You are so much more...

1124
01:02:52,407 --> 01:02:54,375
"You don't need to tell me"

1125
01:02:54,447 --> 01:02:58,816
"Love is like an enemy"

1126
01:02:59,447 --> 01:03:01,415
"If ever you should stumble"

1127
01:03:01,927 --> 01:03:03,895
"You just need a friend"

1128
01:03:04,567 --> 01:03:06,251
"You don't need to bend"

1129
01:03:06,967 --> 01:03:11,733
"Just act like you're right
when you know you're wrong"

1130
01:03:11,807 --> 01:03:14,252
Yeah, OK. You're sure you haven't seen him?

1131
01:03:15,286 --> 01:03:17,255
Not since the sixth grade?

1132
01:03:18,407 --> 01:03:19,374
OK.

1133
01:03:19,447 --> 01:03:22,417
No, no. Ehh... thanks, Spence.

1134
01:03:22,487 --> 01:03:26,571
If he does happen to get in touch with you
tonight, give me a call, all right?

1135
01:03:26,646 --> 01:03:28,615
No, I don't expect him to either.

1136
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:57,734
Hi, God.

1137
01:03:58,525 --> 01:04:00,494
Cooper waxman here.

1138
01:04:00,566 --> 01:04:02,806
I know I haven't been in touch for a while.

1139
01:04:04,165 --> 01:04:06,736
You might Know me better
as the Glen Kyoto Man?

1140
01:04:09,606 --> 01:04:11,370
My brother Ed has sort of gone missing.

1141
01:04:11,446 --> 01:04:15,291
Well, we argued, and he got
this really nasty bump on his head,

1142
01:04:15,366 --> 01:04:17,049
and I haven't heard from him since.

1143
01:04:17,126 --> 01:04:20,493
So I was thinking maybe you could
just go have a quick look around for him

1144
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:22,454
and bring him back home.

1145
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,493
Now, I know what you're thinking.

1146
01:04:25,525 --> 01:04:28,705
You're thinking, "Well,
sure, l could do that

1147
01:04:28,706 --> 01:04:31,885
for you, Cooper, but
what's in it for me?"

1148
01:04:32,925 --> 01:04:34,893
And fair enough.

1149
01:04:34,965 --> 01:04:35,613
So...

1150
01:04:35,685 --> 01:04:37,255
I tell you what.

1151
01:04:37,325 --> 01:04:41,295
If you find Ed
and you bring him back home safely,

1152
01:04:42,125 --> 01:04:44,287
I'll give up one-night stands for eh...

1153
01:04:48,525 --> 01:04:50,492
Come on, God. I'm only human.

1154
01:04:55,965 --> 01:04:57,932
I got it.

1155
01:04:58,765 --> 01:05:00,732
And this is fair.

1156
01:05:03,244 --> 01:05:05,929
I'll lead the sort of life
that Ed Wants me to lead.

1157
01:05:06,724 --> 01:05:09,933
I'll give up the ads, give
up the daytime soaps,

1158
01:05:10,004 --> 01:05:12,974
and I will concentrate
on serious acting jobs.

1159
01:05:15,284 --> 01:05:17,252
Is it a deal?

1160
01:05:22,244 --> 01:05:24,212
It's a deal.

1161
01:05:25,244 --> 01:05:28,453
So stop hanging around here
feeling so pleased with yourself

1162
01:05:28,523 --> 01:05:30,413
and get out there and find my brother.

1163
01:05:30,484 --> 01:05:32,885
"THE LIBERTINES:
Don't Look Back Into The Sun"

1164
01:05:33,604 --> 01:05:35,571
"Don't look back into the sun"

1165
01:05:36,564 --> 01:05:38,532
"Now you know that the time is come"

1166
01:05:39,284 --> 01:05:42,766
"And they said it would never
come for you, oh, oh,oh, oh"

1167
01:05:44,043 --> 01:05:46,285
"Oh, my friend, you haven't changed"

1168
01:05:47,003 --> 01:05:48,972
"You're looking rough and living strange"

1169
01:05:49,044 --> 01:05:53,685

oh, oh,oh, oh"

01:05:54,724 --> 01:05:56,886

"You cast your cards,
but you're on the run"

1172
01:06:07,403 --> 01:06:09,087
Hey.

1173
01:06:09,923 --> 01:06:11,891
I must've fallen asleep.

1174
01:06:12,923 --> 01:06:15,688
You looked so peaceful.
I didn't want to disturb you.

1175
01:06:17,122 --> 01:06:18,090
OK.

1176
01:06:18,963 --> 01:06:20,727
I'm going to go now.

1177
01:06:20,803 --> 01:06:22,214
I better go, so...

1178
01:06:22,283 --> 01:06:23,249
Sorry.

1179
01:06:23,322 --> 01:06:25,051
Don't be sorry.

1180
01:06:25,763 --> 01:06:27,730
You were very snuggly, it was nice.

1181
01:06:29,243 --> 01:06:30,210
Really?

1182
01:06:30,282 --> 01:06:31,853
Mm-hm.

1183
01:06:31,923 --> 01:06:33,890
You're welcome to stay, if you want to.

1184
01:06:37,203 --> 01:06:38,169
OK.

1185
01:06:39,842 --> 01:06:42,732
I guess I could... stay.

1186
01:06:42,803 --> 01:06:44,770
If you'd like to.

1187
01:06:46,562 --> 01:06:48,485
I could use the sleep.

1188
01:06:49,242 --> 01:06:51,211

01:06:59,202 --> 01:07:01,853

01:07:10,242 --> 01:07:12,210
Oh

1195
01:07:16,082 --> 01:07:17,048
Oh!

1196
01:07:17,121 --> 01:07:19,090
Yeah.

1197
01:07:19,162 --> 01:07:20,606
Oh, God.

1198
01:07:27,882 --> 01:07:29,849
- I'm going to come.
- Oh, no.

1199
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:32,572
- I'm going to come.
- No, not yet. Just a little longer.

1200
01:07:32,642 --> 01:07:33,767
What?

1201
01:07:37,201 --> 01:07:39,090
"All the girls come out"

1202
01:07:39,161 --> 01:07:42,085
"The girls come out"

1203
01:07:50,201 --> 01:07:51,407
Come on!

1204
01:07:51,481 --> 01:07:53,688
Oh. Come on!

1205
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:05,649
Holy shit! That's it, I've got it!

1206
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:08,042
- I've got it.
- You've got what?

1207
01:08:08,121 --> 01:08:10,362
- I've got an idea for work.
- What?

1208
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,444
Oh, that's romantic.

1209
01:08:15,521 --> 01:08:17,488
Oh, no. That's not what I mean.

1210
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,642
I wasn't even thinking about work.
Not at all.

1211
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,291
But it just suddenly hit me.

1212
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:24,045
You know, the idea
I've been looking for all weekend.

1213
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,646
So, I got to go. I can save my career.

1214
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,449
You know what, though?

1215
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,448
That was amazing.

1216
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,045
You were amazing.

1217
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:42,362
You are the best thing
that has happened to me since...

1218
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,850
..Ever.

1219
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,527
I got to go.

1220
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:56,170
"THE ONLY ONES: Another
Girl Another Planet"

1221
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,086
Hey, Ed.

1222
01:08:58,159 --> 01:09:00,925
Where have you been, man?
I've been worried sick.

1223
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,971
I called everybody in your address book.
I've been to the hospitals and mortuaries.

1224
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,450
Where's the camera?

1225
01:09:06,519 --> 01:09:10,444
I've been worried sick. With that bump
on your head, you could've had amnesia.

1226
01:09:10,519 --> 01:09:12,760
Been wandering round
not knowing who you were,

1227
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:17,049
and I'd find you years later as an old man
when l take my grandchildren to the circus,

1228
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:20,009
only to discover my long-lost brother
in ring three

1229
01:09:20,079 --> 01:09:24,129
being the bull's-eye for a game of
butt darts by the midget pirates.

1230
01:09:24,199 --> 01:09:26,645
I was having sex with the gorgeous woman
down the hall.

1231
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:29,608
I don't care about the
whole getting laid thing.

1232
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:31,761
You don't need to lie.
I'm just glad you're OK.

1233
01:09:33,879 --> 01:09:34,846
Ed?

1234
01:09:34,919 --> 01:09:36,728
Oh, you left this at my place.

1235
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:38,449
Call me.

1236
01:09:38,519 --> 01:09:40,487
Oh, man.

1237
01:09:40,558 --> 01:09:42,527
Now, that's impressive!

1238
01:09:44,039 --> 01:09:46,645
Guess that's why they call
you the Almighty, huh?

1239
01:09:46,718 --> 01:09:49,120
- Hey, where's the video camera?
- The video camera?

1240
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:51,166
- Yeah, I need it now.
- OK.

1241
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:52,206
Fuck?

1242
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:55,283
"I think I'm on another world with you"

1243
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:58,243
"With you"

1244
01:09:58,678 --> 01:10:02,000
"I'm on another planet with you..."

1245
01:10:02,078 --> 01:10:03,489
Ed, what are you doing?

1246
01:10:04,959 --> 01:10:06,723
Getting my job back.

1247
01:10:06,798 --> 01:10:08,721
"Another girl, another planet"

1248
01:10:13,798 --> 01:10:15,368
Go get 'em.

1249
01:10:25,838 --> 01:10:28,762
What happened?
Did you get all the footage you needed?

1250
01:10:29,798 --> 01:10:30,958
You kidding?

1251
01:10:31,998 --> 01:10:34,882
I was crazy to think that
in just one clay I could

1252
01:10:34,883 --> 01:10:37,767
film all the stuff that took
years to fill my archive,

1253
01:10:38,638 --> 01:10:42,278
I mean, I threw away
everything I needed to save my career.

1254
01:10:42,357 --> 01:10:44,326
You want your archived footage?

1255
01:10:44,398 --> 01:10:46,365
Come with me.

1256
01:10:47,398 --> 01:10:49,877
Coop, it is too late, OK?

1257
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:52,165
The meeting takes place at three o'clock.

1258
01:10:52,238 --> 01:10:54,205
- I'm screwed.
- Then we'd better hustle.

1259
01:10:54,277 --> 01:10:55,927
Come on. I got a surprise for you.

1260
01:10:55,997 --> 01:10:57,966
"GOIVIEZ: Whippin' Piccadilly"

1261
01:11:01,438 --> 01:11:04,043
- What are we doing at Mom and Dad's place?
- Come on.

1262
01:11:11,917 --> 01:11:15,046
"Once upon a time, not too long ago"

1263
01:11:15,956 --> 01:11:19,086
"We took a day out in Manchester.”

1264
01:11:20,077 --> 01:11:22,284
Thought these might come in handy one day.

1265
01:11:22,357 --> 01:11:24,324
Go ahead.

1266
01:11:27,876 --> 01:11:31,437
"Played a bit of football,
fell into the union"

1267
01:11:31,517 --> 01:11:35,078
"Barged our way into the toilet..."

1268
01:11:35,157 --> 01:11:36,807
This could do it.

1269
01:11:36,877 --> 01:11:37,957
Yeah?

1270
01:11:38,916 --> 01:11:39,884
Shit.

1271
01:11:40,757 --> 01:11:42,326
We got to go.

1272
01:11:48,677 --> 01:11:49,359
Shit!

1273
01:11:50,996 --> 01:11:51,963
Oh, God.

1274
01:11:52,036 --> 01:11:55,438
"I remember seeing someone
dressed in a suit"

1275
01:11:55,956 --> 01:11:57,720
"Looking like a lunatic..."

1276
01:11:57,796 --> 01:11:59,560
Found it. Here you go.

1277
01:11:59,636 --> 01:12:01,604
"And we all fall down"

1278
01:12:01,676 --> 01:12:04,998
"There's not enough hours in our trip"

1279
01:12:07,115 --> 01:12:10,086
So we have clearly
not been responsive to your needs.

1280
01:12:10,996 --> 01:12:12,964
I mean, Great Bridge is a leader.

1281
01:12:13,036 --> 01:12:14,879
It's an innovator.

1282
01:12:15,596 --> 01:12:17,963
It's a groundbreaking insurance company.

1283
01:12:18,036 --> 01:12:20,276
It's unique. It's exciting.

1284
01:12:20,355 --> 01:12:23,565
With inspired leadership,
if I may be so bold.

1285
01:12:23,636 --> 01:12:27,083
Let me ask you, what type of
advertising are we talking about?

1286
01:12:28,115 --> 01:12:31,563
Well, I think we need to have
a face of Great Bridge Insurance.

1287
01:12:31,635 --> 01:12:35,117
A spokesman. Someone who represents
everything we stand for.

1288
01:12:35,195 --> 01:12:37,846
Someone attractive,
intelligent, approachable.

1289
01:12:38,556 --> 01:12:39,522
Hmm.

1290
01:12:39,595 --> 01:12:41,359
Anyone in mind?

1291
01:12:41,435 --> 01:12:42,402
Yes.

1292
01:12:43,396 --> 01:12:44,362
Me.

1293
01:12:46,235 --> 01:12:47,202
Right.

1294
01:12:47,275 --> 01:12:50,199
Well, l think we've got
ourselves a poster boy.

1295
01:12:50,275 --> 01:12:52,004
I knew we could work together.

1296
01:12:52,715 --> 01:12:55,525
You guys are un-fucking-believable.

1297
01:12:55,595 --> 01:12:57,359
We try.

1298
01:12:57,434 --> 01:13:00,041
And you're fired. I hate ass kissers.

1299
01:13:00,114 --> 01:13:03,243
If I wanted a bunch of sycophants
who are only after my money,

1300
01:13:03,315 --> 01:13:05,283
I could just hang out with my family.

1301
01:13:05,354 --> 01:13:07,756
- Mr Lamson, have a seat.
- Weren't you fired?

1302
01:13:07,835 --> 01:13:09,359
Shut up, Roger.

1303
01:13:10,515 --> 01:13:12,995
Mr Lanson, I think you're
going to like this.

1304
01:13:19,794 --> 01:13:21,365
Oh, fuck!

1305
01:13:27,034 --> 01:13:29,002
Oh, Shit! Urghl.

1306
01:13:31,634 --> 01:13:33,557
Aaagh!

1307
01:13:35,394 --> 01:13:36,806
Aaargh!

1308
01:13:37,834 --> 01:13:38,915
Aargh!

1309
01:13:39,994 --> 01:13:41,564
Ohh!

1310
01:13:43,274 --> 01:13:44,241
Urgh!

1311
01:13:48,394 --> 01:13:50,441
The unexpected happens all the time.

1312
01:13:52,633 --> 01:13:55,239
With Great Bridge Insurance,
you're covered.

1313
01:13:59,273 --> 01:14:01,355
And so Ed won the account back.

1314
01:14:01,433 --> 01:14:04,039
He got Frank's office and business boomed.

1315
01:14:04,113 --> 01:14:07,402
To show there was no hard feelings,
he even let Roger stay.

1316
01:14:08,113 --> 01:14:11,323
Ed and Ellen moved in together
and I heard that Cathy got fat

1317
01:14:11,393 --> 01:14:13,834
and Jack caught a disease
which caused his

1318
01:14:13,835 --> 01:14:16,274
testicles to swell to the
size of cantaloupes.

1319
01:14:16,353 --> 01:14:18,924
Talk about everything
working out perfectly.

1320
01:14:18,993 --> 01:14:20,962
It's your brother's big day, huh?

1321
01:14:22,193 --> 01:14:24,161
Wish him luck from me.

1322
01:14:25,513 --> 01:14:27,083
And yes.

1323
01:14:27,153 --> 01:14:29,121
I even kept my promise to God.

1324
01:14:29,193 --> 01:14:33,164
I don't know if it was such a good idea
to give up those ads and stuff, man.

1325
01:14:33,233 --> 01:14:34,803
Are you kidding?

1326
01:14:34,873 --> 01:14:39,242
Cooper, in your first serious acting
audition, you landed the role of Hamlet.

1327
01:14:39,313 --> 01:14:41,441
- That's massive.
- Yeah.

1328
01:14:41,513 --> 01:14:43,214
I don't know.
I'm sweating like a bullet here.

1329
01:14:43,215 --> 01:14:44,915
I'm nervous as hell.

1330
01:14:46,512 --> 01:14:48,241
You're going to be great, Coop.

1331
01:14:48,313 --> 01:14:50,281
Good luck.

1332
01:14:53,832 --> 01:14:55,483
Oh, hey, Ed.

1333
01:14:58,232 --> 01:15:00,200
Hey, man, thanks for coming, huh?

1334
01:15:01,553 --> 01:15:03,520
I Wouldn't miss it for the World.

1335
01:15:04,552 --> 01:15:05,998
I'm proud of you.

1336
01:15:07,512 --> 01:15:09,480
Thanks, bud.

1337
01:15:15,192 --> 01:15:16,956
Here we go.

1338
01:15:19,112 --> 01:15:21,080
And in this harsh world.

1339
01:15:22,072 --> 01:15:25,440
Draw thy breath in pain, to tell my story.

1340
01:15:27,551 --> 01:15:30,600
And the rest is silence.

1341
01:15:34,111 --> 01:15:36,479
"DAVID ESSEX: Hold Me Close"

1342
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:53,357
"Hold me close, don't let me go"

1343
01:15:54,391 --> 01:15:56,155
"Oh, no"

1344
01:15:56,591 --> 01:15:57,956
"'I"

1345
01:15:58,031 --> 01:16:00,875
"Yes, I love you and I
think that you Know"

1346
01:16:01,871 --> 01:16:02,838
"That you know"

1347
01:16:02,912 --> 01:16:06,632
"'With your love light shining"

1348
01:16:07,231 --> 01:16:10,393
"Every cloud's got a silver lining"

1349
01:16:10,471 --> 01:16:12,439
Jesus Christ?

1350
01:16:18,231 --> 01:16:21,121
Holy shit, woman.
Haven't you ever heard of waxing?

1351
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,158
Shit?

1352
01:16:25,231 --> 01:16:27,199
It's your line that gets me.

1353
01:16:27,271 --> 01:16:29,433
I got it this time Third time's a charm.

1354
01:16:30,471 --> 01:16:32,438
I can't even listen to you.

1355
01:16:32,511 --> 01:16:34,239
I can't listen to you.

1356
01:16:34,751 --> 01:16:36,718
And were you close to the deceased?

1357
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:38,759
I was her lover.

1358
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:40,993
Oh, my. So you have your liquor license?

1359
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:47,999
I bet you fart like a bunny.

1360
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:54,837
I like fart like a bunny.

1361
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:58,757
But what can we now take
away from her life?

1362
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:04,117
Mark.

1363
01:17:04,669 --> 01:17:06,815
And I'd find you years
from now, as an old man

1364
01:17:06,816 --> 01:17:08,959
when I take my grandchildren
to the circus,

1365
01:17:09,029 --> 01:17:12,192
only to discover my long-lost brother
dangling from the trapeze

1366
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:15,319
by the business end
of some Chinese anal beads.

1367
01:17:15,390 --> 01:17:16,072
Mark.

1368
01:17:16,149 --> 01:17:18,294
And I'd find you years
from now, as an old man

1369
01:17:18,295 --> 01:17:20,438
when I take my grandchildren
to the circus,

1370
01:17:20,509 --> 01:17:23,292
only to discover my long-lost
brother in the tank

1371
01:17:23,293 --> 01:17:26,074
getting mounted by the
transvestite hippo lady.

1372
01:17:27,790 --> 01:17:30,156
Now why would God take
the life of one so hot,

1373
01:17:30,989 --> 01:17:36,632
when there are so many ugly, loose,
gross bitches to choose from?

1374
01:17:37,349 --> 01:17:38,317
Fuck.

1375
01:17:38,389 --> 01:17:40,551
Just fucking lightning bolt their ass.

1376
01:17:40,629 --> 01:17:44,874
We've got these beautiful...
pristine, tight-Iipped, wonderful angels.

1377
01:17:48,309 --> 01:17:50,277
Forget it.

1378
01:17:51,349 --> 01:17:52,635
What'd you do?

1379
01:17:53,149 --> 01:17:54,913
It was, like, seven,
eight, maybe nine times.

1380
01:17:54,914 --> 01:17:56,676
I'm peeing on her.

1381
01:17:56,748 --> 01:17:58,989
She's down there. She's licking my star.

1382
01:17:59,069 --> 01:18:00,480
I'm blowing it in her hair.

1383
01:18:00,549 --> 01:18:01,914
Is she into bestiality?

1384
01:18:01,988 --> 01:18:05,277
My next-door neighbour's got a Great Dane
and she's trying to get him...

1385
01:18:05,349 --> 01:18:08,989
She's putting peanut butter all over
her snoochy and stuff like that.

1386
01:18:09,068 --> 01:18:10,673
That's not right, is it?

1387
01:18:10,748 --> 01:18:12,933
She got my lob wedge, and
she's like, "Oh, yeah, yeah.

1388
01:18:12,934 --> 01:18:15,117
"I got to get the
thing regripped.

1389
01:18:15,829 --> 01:18:17,796
Oh, mah, yeah. She's cool though.

1390
01:18:17,868 --> 01:18:19,837
