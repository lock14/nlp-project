1
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,235
Are you ready?

2
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:57,027
Everything's cool?

3
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,158
Good.

4
00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:15,587
Use your imagination...

5
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,091
and your skills.

6
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,184
Everything is subjective.

7
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,439
Don't elaborate.

8
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,249
He who thinks he's bigger than the rest...

9
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,543
must go to the cemetery.

10
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,264
There he will see what life really is.

11
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,060
It's a handful of dirt.

12
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,216
Pay attention.

13
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,427
I am paying attention.

14
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,762
Give him the keys.

15
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:59,233
Go to the towers. Then go to the café.

16
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,901
Wait for a couple of days.

17
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,113
Look for the violin.

18
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:20,254
The universe has no center and no edges.

19
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,923
Reality is arbitrary.

20
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,928
You want me to translate that?
I don't fucking get it.

21
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,262
Forget it.

22
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,057
He gets it.

23
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:48,886
What can I get you?

24
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,892
A double espresso?

25
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,750
Here you are, sir.

26
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:52,033
Here you go.

27
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,245
Two espressos...

28
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:56,913
...in separate cups.

29
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,790
The customer is always right.

30
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:34,125
You don't speak Spanish, right?

31
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,141
It's very loud here.

32
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,534
I believe that musical instruments,

33
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,952
especially those made out of wood --

34
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,749
Cellos, violins, guitars --

35
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,335
I believe that they resonate, musically,

36
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,003
even when they're not being played.

37
00:22:19,587 --> 00:22:21,463
They have a memory.

38
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,842
Every note...

39
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,176
that's ever been played on them...

40
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,516
is still inside of them...

41
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,355
resonating in the molecules of the wood.

42
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,365
I guess, like everything,

43
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,537
it's just a matter of perception, no?

44
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:57,430
You don't speak Spanish, right?

45
00:33:43,145 --> 00:33:45,314
You don't speak Spanish, right?

46
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,491
Something for the señorita?

47
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,492
A bottle of water, please.

48
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,938
...for the beautiful señorita.

49
00:39:46,925 --> 00:39:49,385
That leaves one more night

50
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,679
for our beautiful love story.

51
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:24,786
You don't speak Spanish, right?

52
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:13,103
The universe has no center
and no edges.

53
00:52:27,518 --> 00:52:28,561
Excuse me.

54
00:52:28,686 --> 00:52:30,396
Are you an American gangster?

55
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:36,903
He says he's not.

56
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:43,702
Maybe he's just saying that...

57
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,668
We're closed.

58
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:06,882
We're not open now,

59
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,548
they're just rehearsing something.

60
00:57:15,222 --> 00:57:16,474
You don't speak Spanish, right?

61
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:31,981
<i>He who thinks he's bigger than the rest...</i>

62
00:59:37,114 --> 00:59:41,614
<i>must go to the cemetery.</i>

63
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:46,164
<i>There he will see</i>

64
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:49,335
<i>what the world really is.</i>

65
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:01,260
<i>It's a handful of dirt.</i>

66
01:06:01,498 --> 01:06:04,751
You don't speak Spanish, right?

67
01:06:10,382 --> 01:06:12,802
You don't speak Spanish, right?

68
01:20:29,115 --> 01:20:30,492
You don't speak Spanish, right?

69
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,653
Son of a bitch.

70
01:21:07,738 --> 01:21:09,448
She's crazy beautiful.

71
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:11,823
So beautiful.

72
01:21:18,998 --> 01:21:20,958
The old men in my village used to say,

73
01:21:21,667 --> 01:21:23,336
"Everything changes by the color

74
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:25,130
of the glass you see it through."

75
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:30,945
Do you know who the Huicholes are?

76
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:34,091
Okay.

77
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:35,467
I get it.

78
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:37,554
It's cool.

79
01:24:56,257 --> 01:24:58,217
Go ahead, get in, get in.

80
01:25:02,055 --> 01:25:04,806
Okay, cool. Crazy. Cool.

81
01:28:22,506 --> 01:28:26,635
Those who think they're
bigger than the rest...

82
01:28:27,594 --> 01:28:29,095
should go to the cemetery.

83
01:28:30,095 --> 01:28:31,137
There,

84
01:28:31,264 --> 01:28:33,975
they will see what life really is.

85
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:38,898
<i>There...</i>

86
01:44:39,023 --> 01:44:40,649
<i>he will see...</i>

87
01:44:40,774 --> 01:44:43,610
<i>what the world really is.</i>

88
01:44:46,654 --> 01:44:51,154
<i>It's a handful of dirt.</i>
