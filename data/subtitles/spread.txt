1
00:01:54,979 --> 00:02:00,054
Utopian socialism, scientiﬁc socialism,
vitalism, mechanism, Darwin, Lamarck...

2
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,825
We've been discussing for hours.
For me it's all bullshit!

3
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:08,670
Maybe right bullshit, yet bullshit. What
matters is the law of the jungle. - Right!

4
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:14,098
It'd be better to admit God's existence
to then accuse him of all ills and...

5
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:18,098
And of all the misfortunes of humanity.
- No, no, God doesn't exist.

6
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:19,634
I'd like to be sure.

7
00:02:20,018 --> 00:02:23,143
All right, then, in this square,
I'll issue a challenge.

8
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:27,138
If there's someone up there who has
infinite power, I give him 10 seconds

9
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:29,491
to kill us all with a lightning bolt.

10
00:02:30,097 --> 00:02:31,234
Attention.

11
00:02:31,616 --> 00:02:35,712
One, two, three...

12
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:40,218
Four, five, six...

13
00:02:40,615 --> 00:02:44,222
Seven, eight, nine. .

14
00:02:44,896 --> 00:02:45,942
Ten!

15
00:02:46,096 --> 00:02:48,417
You've shit yourselves, assholes!

16
00:02:49,975 --> 00:02:52,341
When he drinks, it's the same old story.

17
00:02:53,175 --> 00:02:56,042
Oh, also tonight she made the tour of Europe.

18
00:02:56,055 --> 00:03:00,718
Excuse me, gentlemen, I'll go see the
madwoman. - You got scared, bigot, eh?

19
00:03:03,093 --> 00:03:05,346
Good girl, you see that you react?

20
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,141
Now get up and try to walk.

21
00:03:09,813 --> 00:03:11,816
I can't.
- Get up, come on.

22
00:03:11,853 --> 00:03:15,173
Don't nag her. If she has progressive
paralysis, she can't! - Says who?

23
00:03:15,207 --> 00:03:17,390
Giuseppa the fortune teller,
she's never wrong.

24
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:22,043
Oh, come on, what nonsense! Her illness
is not in the legs, but in the brain.

25
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:26,872
Being cooped upjust to spite her husband,
with whom she should cooperate.

26
00:03:27,331 --> 00:03:29,629
Cooperate what, if he's never home?

27
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:32,268
He goes even abroad, to Vienna, Budapest,

28
00:03:32,372 --> 00:03:34,896
under the pretext of buying special wines.

29
00:03:34,932 --> 00:03:38,852
And I, always at home! - Oh, yes,
she didn't go out for months, poor thing.

30
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,096
Look what he brought from Paris:
a record with a train's noise!

31
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:46,331
Just to illude me of being on the road.
- And who prevents you from going out?

32
00:03:46,365 --> 00:03:49,691
Go and see the farmers working
like beasts in your lands!

33
00:03:49,725 --> 00:03:51,875
They can't afford these whims.

34
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,890
Illnesses invented just to please
rich and spoiled ladies like you!

35
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:58,859
Socialist! - What d'you think?
It's not an insult, y'know?

36
00:03:59,528 --> 00:04:02,441
Don't heed him, he's a boor ofa farmer.

37
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:06,265
You hear?

38
00:04:07,649 --> 00:04:09,389
No, it's not the master.

39
00:04:11,048 --> 00:04:15,807
It's almost 22:00. I'm going to sleep.
- Wait, don't leave me alone, I'm afraid.

40
00:04:15,842 --> 00:04:20,120
Afraid of what? Soon comes Miss Clara
to keep you company. Good night.

41
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,612
Cursed! Look at them!

42
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,343
Subversives!

43
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,754
Pigs! Without shame!

44
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,519
Anarchists!

45
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,257
You're all possessed, so there!

46
00:04:58,723 --> 00:05:00,259
Give me the incense.

47
00:05:02,564 --> 00:05:04,305
Deliver me, O Lord, from eternal death

48
00:05:04,324 --> 00:05:07,213
on the awful day when
heaven and earth will move.

49
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:10,951
That day is a day of wrath, calamity
and misery, a very sad day

50
00:05:10,963 --> 00:05:13,012
when You will come tojudge...

51
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:16,427
"Down with the ba
"
What're you writing, you fool!

52
00:05:16,461 --> 00:05:19,771
''Ball'' is with two "L",
like "imbecile. " Shit!

53
00:05:22,882 --> 00:05:26,163
I brought "La Domenica del Corriere"
and your husband's mail.

54
00:05:26,197 --> 00:05:28,413
There is also a registered letter.

55
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:32,507
From where comes this music?

56
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,223
From the co-op, no?

57
00:05:34,242 --> 00:05:39,201
The priest was unable to prevent the ball,
and he's gone off his head.

58
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,201
Actually, he never had one. - It's wrong
to treat him so, he's a good man.

59
00:05:44,235 --> 00:05:47,759
You know what he said the other day
in confession, Don Giuseppe?

60
00:05:47,795 --> 00:05:50,264
That typhus was sent to me by the devil.

61
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,571
May I have some?

62
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,567
It's bitter, how can you?
- I like it.

63
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:16,321
Why didn't you go dancing?

64
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:21,019
You're aware of my fiance's ideas.
To him, the dance is a scandal.

65
00:06:21,158 --> 00:06:24,149
Imagine now that he's
president of the Catholic Club.

66
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:29,774
And then, at least
at your place I can smoke.

67
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:44,677
Hey, Mr. Luigi. Mr. Luigi! You've arrived.

68
00:06:50,394 --> 00:06:52,487
You traveled through the night?

69
00:06:52,715 --> 00:06:53,795
No...

70
00:06:56,514 --> 00:06:58,197
Feed it.
- Right away.

71
00:07:16,072 --> 00:07:17,755
Welcome back.
- Thanks.

72
00:07:17,793 --> 00:07:20,910
Excuse me, someone came
to rummage in our office last night.

73
00:07:20,913 --> 00:07:24,394
I found all the drawers open
and the documents were moved.

74
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:25,745
Come and see.

75
00:07:27,632 --> 00:07:31,471
I also found a hair pin.
It's not the first time that your wife...

76
00:07:31,507 --> 00:07:34,884
My wife? But she hasn't come
down those stairs for months!

77
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,235
Thieves steal, and here nothing is missing.

78
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,992
And then the window was closed.

79
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,269
We'll talk later, accountant.
- That's fine.

80
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,230
Oh, hello, Mr. Luigi. Do you want
breakfast now? - No, thank you.

81
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:54,630
Maybe you prefer to rest?
- No, I'm not tired at all.

82
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:59,899
Say, the lady got up from bed these days?
- Course not! When you're away, then...

83
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:01,240
And my peacocks?

84
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:04,887
Luckily I took care of them,
the lady can't stand them.

85
00:08:04,908 --> 00:08:07,262
She even proposed me to poison them.

86
00:08:27,706 --> 00:08:28,980
You scared me.

87
00:08:37,145 --> 00:08:41,058
Where were you all these days?
- I made the rounds of the customers.

88
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:44,683
I cashed in money,
I toured half the province.

89
00:08:44,826 --> 00:08:48,534
You were also in the countryside?
- Yes, I saw your peasants.

90
00:08:49,304 --> 00:08:52,384
You know, it's all going to ruin,
there is no guidance, nothing.

91
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:54,432
And when will you leave again?

92
00:08:54,943 --> 00:08:57,811
I don't know, it depends.
Maybe in a few days.

93
00:08:58,183 --> 00:09:00,436
I'd like to sit a little home now.

94
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:03,864
In the end, we were so little
together, the two of us.

95
00:09:03,898 --> 00:09:06,070
It was my fault according to you?

96
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:11,062
I talked to a famous specialist. He gave me
a new tranquillizer for you, very effective.

97
00:09:11,097 --> 00:09:12,576
It'll definitely do you well.

98
00:09:12,623 --> 00:09:17,434
You bring me tranquillizers to avoid
quarrels. You only think of your tranquility.

99
00:09:18,783 --> 00:09:23,663
No, I think of your healing. - If you
really want me to heal, get me out of here.

100
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:26,668
I want to come with you in your next trip.

101
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:29,495
You're sick, take care of yourself.
Don't start over.

102
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:32,288
No, I'm not sick,
and you know it better than me!

103
00:09:32,301 --> 00:09:36,980
You fill me with sleeping pills to take
away my strength to rebel. You're a coward!

104
00:09:37,015 --> 00:09:38,049
Alright!

105
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:42,106
When you've calmed down, we'll talk.

106
00:09:53,979 --> 00:09:58,019
I'll bring the mail to Mrs. Antonia.
Wait for me here. - Be quick though.

107
00:09:58,054 --> 00:09:59,202
Be right back.

108
00:10:03,298 --> 00:10:05,687
Holy Mary.
- Pray for us.

109
00:10:05,857 --> 00:10:08,565
Holy Mother of God.
- Pray for us.

110
00:10:08,577 --> 00:10:11,410
Holy Virgin of virgins.
- Pray for us.

111
00:10:11,418 --> 00:10:14,205
Mother of Christ.
- Pray for us.

112
00:10:14,336 --> 00:10:17,113
Mother of divine grace.
- Pray for us.

113
00:10:17,336 --> 00:10:19,134
There's only a newspaper.

114
00:10:19,897 --> 00:10:22,649
Mother most chaste.
- Pray for us.

115
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:25,399
Mother in violate.
- Pray for us.

116
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:28,370
Immaculate Mother.
- Pray for us.

117
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,152
Mother worthy of love.
- Pray for us.

118
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,152
Mother admirable for virtues.
- Pray for us.

119
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,355
No, Enrico is downstairs waiting for me.

120
00:10:37,816 --> 00:10:39,294
Come on, strip off.

121
00:10:40,415 --> 00:10:41,894
It's not necessary.

122
00:10:42,054 --> 00:10:46,822
Keep us without sin,
and pray for us.

123
00:10:47,254 --> 00:10:51,455
Holy Virgin of virgins.
- Keep us without sin.

124
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,419
Mother of God.
- Keep us without sin.

125
00:10:55,453 --> 00:10:59,765
Mother of divine grace.
- Keep us without sin.

126
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:51,889
Deign today, Lord, to keep us without sin.

127
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:54,518
Invincible tower.
- Pray for us.

128
00:11:54,528 --> 00:11:57,282
Refuge of sinners.
- Pray for us.

129
00:11:57,288 --> 00:12:00,235
Help of Christians.
- Pray for us.

130
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:04,613
What happened?
- I'm sorry, but Mr. Luigi is back.

131
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:08,808
So what? - I had to help him, I couldn't
say no. - The Mass must have begun.

132
00:12:08,842 --> 00:12:13,142
And that's how you get lost,
becoming ensnared by the evil one!

133
00:12:13,447 --> 00:12:16,996
Passing off debauchery and
corruption as modernity!

134
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:23,090
So much scandal, poisoning the youth
with the seduction of unrestrained dancing!

135
00:12:23,366 --> 00:12:27,206
And what's even more serious,
inducing it to lies and deception!

136
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:28,264
But...

137
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:32,133
you can't with impunity
provoke the anger of the Lord!

138
00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:41,584
I told you not to come for any reason.

139
00:12:41,605 --> 00:12:44,051
They arrested the brothers Bonetti.
- I know.

140
00:12:44,086 --> 00:12:47,465
He'll betray you too, I'm sure.
- Don't lose your head.

141
00:12:47,605 --> 00:12:51,393
With the evidence he has,
he can send you immediately to trial.

142
00:12:51,443 --> 00:12:54,515
He'll prove you found the money
for Fu
vio's jailbreak.

143
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,616
Wanna bet he still has those papers?

144
00:12:57,203 --> 00:13:00,769
He destroyed them.
- That's what he said. And you're so naive. .

145
00:13:00,802 --> 00:13:05,057
It's none of your business!
- It is, since in this story there's me too.

146
00:13:05,322 --> 00:13:08,201
I don't like to spend
the rest of my life in jail.

147
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:12,347
Listen to me, Louis. Sandro is a pig.
There's not a single minute to lose.

148
00:13:12,383 --> 00:13:16,373
Yes, yes, I'll think. - But if they
catch us in the meantime? - Get out, now.

149
00:13:20,081 --> 00:13:21,128
Go!

150
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,504
Here you go.
- He's gone already?

151
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,696
He had a visit. It seems a partner is
going to fail and he fears to be involved.

152
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,615
I wish he'd fall into poverty!
So he'd lose all his self assurance.

153
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,299
And you, instead, all the properties
and lands that your father left you.

154
00:13:55,959 --> 00:14:00,464
He left without even saying goodbye.
- Maybe he was afraid of another row.

155
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:48,977
You...

156
00:15:11,592 --> 00:15:12,753
It was you.

157
00:15:13,673 --> 00:15:14,764
What?

158
00:15:17,511 --> 00:15:21,631
I saw you, I was behind the glass door.
You killed him with the candlestick.

159
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:23,168
What are you saying?

160
00:15:23,951 --> 00:15:25,178
It was not me.

161
00:15:25,672 --> 00:15:29,857
Sure it was you! - No.
- With the candlestick there! I saw you.

162
00:15:29,892 --> 00:15:34,043
Look, you've got blood on your hands.
- Wait! - Help! Help!

163
00:15:34,591 --> 00:15:39,948
Help! Help! He killed him! He killed him!

164
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,822
Help!

165
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,248
Help-’ Help!

166
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:49,429
He killed him! - But whom?
- With the candlestick!

167
00:15:49,463 --> 00:15:52,135
Where is he?
- I saw him, run! Run!

168
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:54,298
Quick, quick! - Go.
- Come on!

169
00:15:55,828 --> 00:15:58,808
Oh, God!
- Run, go call someone.

170
00:16:30,025 --> 00:16:33,306
"The police are investigating
a likely funder of theirs,

171
00:16:33,341 --> 00:16:35,513
whose name is not disclosed yet. "

172
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:40,801
But, you knew who denounced them?
- Yes, it's a client of mine.

173
00:16:41,504 --> 00:16:45,804
He needed money, and I made him
get a loan through my bank. - So then...

174
00:16:47,144 --> 00:16:51,105
He was killed an hour ago.
They smashed his head with a candlestick.

175
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:52,719
And how do you know?

176
00:16:53,224 --> 00:16:57,570
I had gone there to get back some
documents, and I found him. - I see.

177
00:16:57,903 --> 00:17:01,863
Tomorrow they'll make them sing,
and they'll get to you, you can bet.

178
00:17:01,942 --> 00:17:05,628
Well, this wasn't said yet.
- No, but it's more than likely.

179
00:17:06,623 --> 00:17:09,079
It's not that someone saw you?
- Yes.

180
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:11,157
A niece of his saw me.

181
00:17:11,182 --> 00:17:14,915
But she's a girl; hasn't the
slightest idea who I am. - And then?

182
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:18,652
I took those papers and managed
to flee before people arrived.

183
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:22,957
But if the police were to subject you
to a confrontation, what would you do?

184
00:17:23,102 --> 00:17:24,375
Tell the truth.

185
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,891
Do you know who is the murderer?

186
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:29,530
No. And anyway, I wouldn't tell.

187
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,300
Well, for the moment I advise you
stay well hidden. Then we'll see.

188
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:36,701
I could stay here with you.
- No, it would be very unwise.

189
00:17:36,941 --> 00:17:39,147
This is the house of your lawyer.

190
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:41,770
You need to find a safe hideout.

191
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,903
Halt!
- Stop! - Halt!

192
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:47,922
What's an the wagon?
- Hay, sergeant.

193
00:17:47,939 --> 00:17:52,298
Get the pitchfork and stick it in the pile.
- Blessed Virgin, what's with you?

194
00:17:52,334 --> 00:17:55,086
It's the third time
you make me poke the hay.

195
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:04,538
Go home. Go.

196
00:18:25,376 --> 00:18:28,777
It came back alone. Watch.
- And the master? Where is he?

197
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,095
Virgin Mary!

198
00:18:31,215 --> 00:18:35,296
There's no one inside. - Right!
- What happened? - I wish I knew.

199
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:38,320
Where is Mr. Luigi?
- The horse came home alone.

200
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:41,523
It's empty!

201
00:18:51,653 --> 00:18:52,757
Vincenzo.

202
00:18:58,052 --> 00:18:59,691
Come on inside.
- Hi.

203
00:19:02,573 --> 00:19:06,492
The lawyer explained to you?
- Yes. I prepared the hideout in the barn.

204
00:19:06,528 --> 00:19:09,458
I think it's safer than
Aunt Vittoria's apartment.

205
00:19:09,491 --> 00:19:12,571
How's your wound, you need a doctor?
- No, it's just a scratch.

206
00:19:12,607 --> 00:19:15,076
Nowl close the shop and I'll join you.

207
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:19,383
I'll take your bag. You know the way, right?
Ah, I left the lamp on.

208
00:20:41,765 --> 00:20:46,474
Are you sure you didn't make a mistake
coming here, a step away from your home?

209
00:20:46,884 --> 00:20:49,034
Well, I didn't have much choice.

210
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:53,364
And to think of it, maybe this is the
only place where they'll never find me.

211
00:20:53,398 --> 00:20:56,845
Should I... Should I tell Antonia
that you're here? - No.

212
00:20:57,403 --> 00:21:00,929
She would never understand
why I got myself into this mess.

213
00:21:00,962 --> 00:21:05,308
And then, if they were to question her,
I'm afraid she'd give herself away.

214
00:21:05,563 --> 00:21:07,519
Don't you think how she'll feel?

215
00:21:07,521 --> 00:21:10,638
She's too caught up by herself
to worry about me.

216
00:21:10,642 --> 00:21:14,226
Well. . If you don't need nothing else, I. .
- Ah, Vincenzo..

217
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:18,393
Us two, we've always conversed very little.

218
00:21:19,281 --> 00:21:20,589
Anyway, thanks.

219
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:26,029
Ah, careful not to let the light filter
through the blinds. Those, especially.

220
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,236
They've always been shut. Good night.

221
00:22:02,077 --> 00:22:05,563
The bag was open and the money
was missing. They murdered him.

222
00:22:05,597 --> 00:22:09,967
Well, it's not the first time that the horse
comes home alone. - This time it's different.

223
00:22:10,557 --> 00:22:12,445
I feel that my husband is dead.

224
00:22:12,477 --> 00:22:16,717
We can't yet say, ma'am. Let's wait
for the outcome of the investigations.

225
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:19,378
He'd have given us news, don't you think?

226
00:22:19,596 --> 00:22:22,919
It's useless to try to deceive me.
My husband is dead!

227
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:25,814
One foot after the other, this way.

228
00:22:26,115 --> 00:22:31,115
Bravo, bravo, bravo!
You saw how she walks? - I never doubted.

229
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:33,936
I entrust her to you. Careful!
- You see, ma'am,

230
00:22:33,954 --> 00:22:38,493
every day arrive letters from customers,
reminders. . complaints, too.

231
00:22:38,634 --> 00:22:42,570
Your husband has disappeared, sadly,
and we can't go on like this.

232
00:22:42,913 --> 00:22:46,906
Besides we must collect the amounts due.
- And what should we do?

233
00:22:46,994 --> 00:22:49,474
Take on at the earliest a sales rep,

234
00:22:49,515 --> 00:22:52,711
a qualified person,
who may replace your husband.

235
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:57,896
Here, this is a list of names.
They are all people of extreme confidence.

236
00:23:00,554 --> 00:23:03,057
Another man in the place of my husband?

237
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:15,673
I brought you some more paper.
The chisel and the newspaper.

238
00:23:15,707 --> 00:23:18,903
Thanks. What does it say?
- Nothing, nothing new.

239
00:23:19,711 --> 00:23:21,974
Need a hand?
- No, thank you.

240
00:23:22,471 --> 00:23:25,337
That's fine.
I'm going down to open the shop.

241
00:24:32,785 --> 00:24:36,184
Don't come and seek treatment from me,
when you act on your own.

242
00:24:36,221 --> 00:24:38,983
Didn't you say I was healthy?
- What does that mean?

243
00:24:38,983 --> 00:24:43,463
You're in no condition to travel alone.
And with an animal that you don't know.

244
00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:46,463
As a girl, I drove the horse
better than a man. Just watch!

245
00:24:46,499 --> 00:24:49,205
Go! Go!
- Oh, Virgin Mary!

246
00:25:48,259 --> 00:25:49,646
Madam, watch out!

247
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:52,692
But what are you doing?
Get out of the way!

248
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:56,698
What are you doing?

249
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:18,796
Come on!

250
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,174
Come on! Go on!

251
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,586
Come on, let's hurry up. Go on!

252
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,353
Come on!

253
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:39,444
Phew!

254
00:27:43,608 --> 00:27:47,089
Will you tell me what's wrong with you?
Why did you stop?

255
00:27:48,088 --> 00:27:51,262
Are you tired? Eh?
Come on!

256
00:27:51,689 --> 00:27:53,576
Come on! Come on, move!

257
00:27:53,608 --> 00:27:55,417
It's useless to insist.

258
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:59,323
If you don't come in here first,
the horse won't move.

259
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:01,048
Cheer UP!

260
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:02,613
Come over!

261
00:28:12,406 --> 00:28:15,580
For years now the horse
is accustomed to stop here.

262
00:28:15,846 --> 00:28:17,848
Your husband was my supplier.

263
00:28:17,885 --> 00:28:21,265
As you can see from the invoices
I also owe him a debt,

264
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:23,020
which he never urged me for.

265
00:28:23,046 --> 00:28:25,809
This is the personal bottle of your husband.

266
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:30,425
He never set off without first having a drink.
- I'm a teetotaler, thank you.

267
00:28:31,765 --> 00:28:35,132
If you don't drink, the horse won't start.

268
00:28:37,204 --> 00:28:38,843
lcould pretend, then.

269
00:28:39,565 --> 00:28:42,739
It doesn't trust appearances,
it's hard to deceive.

270
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,646
It has like a sixth sense.

271
00:28:45,804 --> 00:28:49,900
My husband was arrested four years ago.
They came to get him a night.

272
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:53,221
For what reason?
- He's an anarchist.

273
00:28:53,324 --> 00:28:56,999
What you see is a portrait of Bakunin.
For him it was very important.

274
00:28:57,163 --> 00:29:01,792
Y'know, Fulvio didn't remain in prison.
Someone helped him to escape.

275
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:04,603
And is now abroad.
- You have children?

276
00:29:04,883 --> 00:29:06,180
I'll show you.

277
00:29:06,643 --> 00:29:10,067
Eh, were it not for Mr. Luigi,
those poor creatures...

278
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,778
Here you go.
All females.

279
00:29:17,961 --> 00:29:20,338
Your husband would often stop with us.

280
00:29:20,361 --> 00:29:23,205
His place was there,
at the head of the table.

281
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,710
He helped the girls with their homework,
and when they had finished

282
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:29,234
he played with them until they fell asleep.

283
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,154
Sometimes he also slept here.

284
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,487
You want to see his room?
- Yes.

285
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,778
Ines. - Yes, Mom?
- Escort her yourself. - Right away.

286
00:29:55,438 --> 00:29:59,009
This is your husband's stuff.
You can take it if you want.

287
00:30:07,277 --> 00:30:10,250
This alarm clock means
that he often slept here.

288
00:30:10,285 --> 00:30:13,222
Even twice a month.
He always wanted this room.

289
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:17,028
And why just this?

290
00:30:17,356 --> 00:30:20,530
I know he used to say:
''I like that little window. "

291
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,358
Hello. - Hello.
- You slept well? - Well, so...

292
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:37,371
I brought you some vests, if you're cold.
- Thanks.

293
00:31:37,548 --> 00:31:38,880
I'll sterilize you.

294
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:41,470
No, Vincenzo, there's no need.
- No, no, no.

295
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:44,549
If it gets infected everything
becomes harder. Here.

296
00:31:44,584 --> 00:31:45,617
Let me see.

297
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:52,673
Do you have news of Antonia?
- No. She's not back yet.

298
00:31:56,468 --> 00:31:59,288
It's swollen. Does it hurt?
- Yes, a little.

299
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:01,141
I'd calla doctor.

300
00:32:01,188 --> 00:32:04,042
No, I said I don't trust.
Change the bandage.

301
00:32:06,227 --> 00:32:08,262
I'm worried.
- About what?

302
00:32:09,425 --> 00:32:11,529
She's been gone for a week now.

303
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:15,311
She'll be doing the rounds of the customers.
Exactly as you used to do.

304
00:32:15,507 --> 00:32:19,192
I don't see why you should worry.
Did anything happen to you?

305
00:32:19,266 --> 00:32:21,586
What's that got to do with it?
It's my job.

306
00:32:21,746 --> 00:32:23,281
And then I'm a man.

307
00:32:23,424 --> 00:32:25,984
Antonia is childish, like a little girl.

308
00:32:26,506 --> 00:32:27,836
It's your fault.

309
00:32:27,984 --> 00:32:29,019
Why?

310
00:32:29,506 --> 00:32:31,348
You didn't help her grow up.

311
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:35,480
You think I didn't?
Our marriage has never worked, even in bed.

312
00:32:35,944 --> 00:32:38,778
It's been a disaster
from the very first night.

313
00:32:38,784 --> 00:32:41,048
Educations too different, wrong.

314
00:32:41,864 --> 00:32:45,617
I didn't succeed.
For this I've tried other interests.

315
00:32:50,782 --> 00:32:51,817
Yeah.

316
00:32:55,982 --> 00:33:00,282
I prepared you a nice herring,
so it helps you to drink. Look how you do.

317
00:33:01,662 --> 00:33:05,461
Is it necessary? - If you want to do
this job you'd better get used to it.

318
00:33:05,497 --> 00:33:07,964
Only with spicy stuff
you can judge the wine.

319
00:33:07,981 --> 00:33:11,787
Come, come, ma'am.
The sooner you start, the sooner you finish.

320
00:33:11,821 --> 00:33:16,555
And if I may, pay no attention to the
smell, it's just the taste that counts.

321
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:25,913
Want to eat a piece of cheese with worms?
It takes away the taste of salt.

322
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:29,386
No, thanks, this is enough.

323
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,502
Nice rip-off from your husband
with the bottles.

324
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,849
3 out of 10 are to be protested.

325
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:40,083
So, out of 10,000, you reject 3,000?
- Sure, they're bad, and I won't pay for.

326
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,761
You take advantage that I'm a woman.
- Man or woman, I don't care.

327
00:33:43,796 --> 00:33:47,384
These are bottles randomly selected
by you. Am I right or wrong?

328
00:33:47,897 --> 00:33:51,377
It's fairthat you taste them one by one.
Then you'll see if you agree with me.

329
00:33:51,413 --> 00:33:54,415
You don't want me to drink all this wine?
I'm a teetotaler.

330
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:57,782
If you don't drink, you can't do this job.

331
00:33:57,817 --> 00:34:02,221
Your husband did even 100 tastings in
one day and no one ever saw him drunk.

332
00:34:02,698 --> 00:34:03,767
Alright!

333
00:34:08,056 --> 00:34:09,239
This is good.

334
00:34:13,215 --> 00:34:14,443
This is sound.

335
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,061
This too.

336
00:34:25,255 --> 00:34:26,382
This too.

337
00:34:29,135 --> 00:34:30,204
This too.

338
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:37,099
Madam, stay and sleep here,
you can't go in this state. - My bag.

339
00:34:37,134 --> 00:34:41,333
It's here, ma'am! - And my money?
- It's here, in the bag. We're not thieves.

340
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:42,516
I feel sick!

341
00:34:45,373 --> 00:34:50,014
Come on, Nane, be quick!
Bring down the net, come on!

342
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:52,096
You're like a snail!

343
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,907
Snail my ass! It's all tangled!

344
00:34:54,942 --> 00:34:57,681
Why has this horse stopped?

345
00:34:57,692 --> 00:35:01,777
It's a clever beast, there's a reason
why it stops. He wants the lamp lit.

346
00:35:01,813 --> 00:35:07,023
Look at the lady how she sleeps well.
She's tired, huh? - She's tired from wine!

347
00:35:10,771 --> 00:35:13,297
With this binge she'll wake up in Padua!

348
00:36:07,806 --> 00:36:09,751
Who is it?
- The concierge.

349
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:11,132
Come in.

350
00:36:12,327 --> 00:36:16,452
Good evening, ma'am. ljust wanted to
warn you that it's almost dinner time.

351
00:36:16,485 --> 00:36:21,240
Sorry but, I woke up in this room and
I don't know where I am. - Don't you recall?

352
00:36:21,525 --> 00:36:25,894
Last night your horse stopped
right in front of our club.

353
00:36:26,005 --> 00:36:29,291
Oh, because this is...
- Yes, the hunting club.

354
00:36:29,324 --> 00:36:33,275
You were asleep. We tried to wake
you up, but we didn't succeed.

355
00:36:33,309 --> 00:36:37,224
We thought it was best to put you to bed.
- And who undressed me?

356
00:36:37,525 --> 00:36:41,028
The maid and... and myself,
with all due respect.

357
00:36:43,643 --> 00:36:48,489
This is my husband's handwriting. - Yes,
he was among the most assiduous members.

358
00:36:48,844 --> 00:36:52,780
So true that he had this room
booked for the whole year. - Booked?

359
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:57,724
He used to come here to go hunting with
friends. You see? Those are his rifles.

360
00:36:58,242 --> 00:37:00,449
I didn't know he liked hunting.

361
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:03,766
Probably for him it was more like a pretext.

362
00:37:03,802 --> 00:37:08,534
Sometimes he'd shut himself in here
for days. He read, wrote...

363
00:37:09,161 --> 00:37:13,929
May I keep these manuscripts?
- Of course. All that is here, is yours.

364
00:37:14,201 --> 00:37:18,297
The guns, the books... There must be
even some clothes. Here, you see?

365
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,536
But there are also women's clothes.
- Oh, you can use them if you want.

366
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:30,081
Come on, the truth is that you've had luck.
- Yeah, luck! It's having an eye, fuck!

367
00:37:52,197 --> 00:37:54,085
Good evening, Mrs. De Angelis.

368
00:37:54,117 --> 00:37:58,318
Let me to introduce myself.
I am count Brandini, president of the club.

369
00:37:58,351 --> 00:37:59,693
Nice to meet you.

370
00:37:59,717 --> 00:38:04,476
Your husband and I were good friends,
and we're very pleased you're our guest.

371
00:38:04,512 --> 00:38:06,934
It's an offhand meeting without formalities.

372
00:38:06,956 --> 00:38:10,574
Allow me, ma'am?
Notary Carminati. Mr. Granzotto.

373
00:38:11,076 --> 00:38:14,155
Professor Cenigo. - Delighted.
- Mr. and Mrs. Benedetti.

374
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,750
The Marquises Dona. Sen. Galvani.

375
00:38:16,956 --> 00:38:19,231
The painter Galassi.
- It's a pleasure.

376
00:38:19,235 --> 00:38:22,556
Professor Alberti,
head of the hospital of Treviso.

377
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,534
Count Zagni. Dr. Sonigo.

378
00:38:24,554 --> 00:38:28,467
Architect Vichi and Mr. Marengo.
Maestro Del Bene-Sossi.

379
00:38:28,554 --> 00:38:32,103
And, last but not least, Dr. Pagano.
Ms. De Angelis.

380
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:33,833
Antonia De Angelis?

381
00:38:34,074 --> 00:38:37,032
Your husband said that you were sick.
- With what?

382
00:38:37,034 --> 00:38:39,753
Something like a progressive paralysis.

383
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:41,597
As you can see I'm healed.

384
00:38:41,914 --> 00:38:45,873
Paola Pagano is the first woman in
our province with a medicine degree.

385
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,284
I leave you in good company.
- Sure.

386
00:38:50,273 --> 00:38:53,481
Don't you feel a little uneasy
among all these men?

387
00:38:53,913 --> 00:38:54,936
Not a bit.

388
00:38:54,992 --> 00:38:57,905
But, you're really a doctor by profession?
- Yes.

389
00:38:57,913 --> 00:39:00,992
Excuse the curiosity,
how are you considered by people?

390
00:39:01,027 --> 00:39:02,835
More or less like a whore.

391
00:39:04,911 --> 00:39:08,472
So, waiting for the ducks,
I was in the cask a whole day!

392
00:39:08,505 --> 00:39:11,394
That's why you stink of herring like a cunt!

393
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,681
At long last!

394
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:31,692
You're gorgeous when you laugh.
- Thanks!

395
00:39:34,389 --> 00:39:37,802
But now you overdo, Professor.
Keep your hands to yourself.

396
00:39:38,068 --> 00:39:41,186
Think if I were to tell your wife
what a pig you are.

397
00:39:41,188 --> 00:39:42,280
She knows!

398
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:49,748
Have you noticed how men become bold
with women when they are in a group?

399
00:39:49,782 --> 00:39:51,568
With you they have familiarity.

400
00:39:51,588 --> 00:39:55,632
No, truth is that the group gives them
the strength that alone they don't have.

401
00:39:55,666 --> 00:40:00,922
Like certain beasts that attack when they're
in the pack. - You're too bad with men. I. .

402
00:40:02,346 --> 00:40:04,108
I say it's a damned...

403
00:40:04,826 --> 00:40:05,974
bad habit!

404
00:40:07,025 --> 00:40:11,735
What energy! If you did so with your husband,
I see why he's gone so point blank.

405
00:40:38,344 --> 00:40:39,423
Well?

406
00:40:41,702 --> 00:40:44,387
Nothing.
Nobody knows anything about it.

407
00:40:45,663 --> 00:40:46,994
She disappeared.

408
00:40:54,382 --> 00:40:58,170
There was something between you
and my husband, right? - Yes.

409
00:40:58,262 --> 00:40:59,853
I had just graduated.

410
00:41:00,061 --> 00:41:02,610
One winter evening, with a snowstorm,

411
00:41:02,621 --> 00:41:05,920
I was called to a small hotel
because a client felt bad.

412
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,922
It was your husband.

413
00:41:07,981 --> 00:41:11,907
You already knew each other?
- Yes, we had met here at the club.

414
00:41:12,581 --> 00:41:14,775
What had my husband?
- Nothing.

415
00:41:15,101 --> 00:41:17,478
He was in bed, and smoked quietly.

416
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,367
And what did he say
when you came in his room?

417
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:22,590
"Lock the door. "

418
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,295
Like that, simply, without preamble?

419
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,222
He sat me down on the bed.

420
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,894
Then, with the air of an old father,
wise and worried, said:

421
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:34,061
"You, girl, you're not well. "

422
00:41:34,978 --> 00:41:36,253
I began to cry.

423
00:41:36,498 --> 00:41:39,036
Why?
- It was true, and no one had noticed.

424
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:40,844
Didn't you realize it was a trick?

425
00:41:40,858 --> 00:41:44,021
Assuming that it was,
he needed me, and I him.

426
00:41:44,298 --> 00:41:48,759
In the end, my ailments were just hysteria,
nothing else. He made them pass.

427
00:41:48,818 --> 00:41:53,018
You had had relationships with other men,
I guess. - Yes, but young and stupid.

428
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:56,760
You've been lovers for long?
- More than lovers. - You mean?

429
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,739
We were mostly friends.

430
00:41:58,896 --> 00:42:02,177
To me it's inconceivable. How can exist
friendship between man and woman?

431
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:05,302
Yet we were fine whether
in bed or sitting at a table.

432
00:42:05,335 --> 00:42:08,996
We'd meet on Saturday night
in his typography, with fellow editors.

433
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:12,655
I never knew that my husband
had a typography. - Ladies, please!

434
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:16,001
Why not? It was his passion!
- It's pouring!

435
00:42:18,175 --> 00:42:24,001
Luigi was a vintnerjust to have an excuse
to roam as he pleased, to go abroad.

436
00:42:24,574 --> 00:42:26,827
But his real activity was another.

437
00:42:27,094 --> 00:42:31,175
He published political and social writings
of authors he sought in France

438
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:34,213
or England. - I found out that
he also had a passion to write.

439
00:42:34,248 --> 00:42:37,286
He wrote on burning issues,
often anti-religious.

440
00:42:37,373 --> 00:42:41,367
And published them under a pseudonym.
- Which one? - Ulysses.

441
00:42:42,373 --> 00:42:45,001
Why he always hid these things from me?

442
00:42:45,853 --> 00:42:48,061
Have you ever asked him about it?

443
00:42:50,532 --> 00:42:52,273
My clothes fit you well.

444
00:42:53,891 --> 00:42:56,360
Keep them, it pleases me.
- Thanks.

445
00:42:57,851 --> 00:42:59,648
May I tell you something?

446
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:03,315
I imagined you completely different.

447
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:05,606
Me too.

448
00:43:06,092 --> 00:43:07,559
I like you that way.

449
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:17,045
This is your account, ma'am. - Thanks.
- And these are your husband's accounts.

450
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,018
He paid every six months.

451
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:22,115
Dinner for 12 people.

452
00:43:22,411 --> 00:43:24,219
Dinner for 15 people.

453
00:43:24,449 --> 00:43:26,463
Banquet for 22 people.

454
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:31,222
I see it was always him who paid.
- He was a man of great generosity.

455
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:36,409
These are two or three other small bills,
and this is the total, if you don't mind.

456
00:43:36,443 --> 00:43:39,228
I would check.
- Of course, it's your right.

457
00:43:45,688 --> 00:43:49,112
Miss Clara Visentin.
Dinner and bedroom?

458
00:43:54,927 --> 00:43:56,405
Dinner and bedroom.

459
00:43:57,246 --> 00:43:58,726
Dinner and bedroom.

460
00:44:00,007 --> 00:44:04,086
Why should I pay these bills? - As you see,
they're signed by your husband.

461
00:44:04,121 --> 00:44:06,030
And now that he's no more...

462
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:24,188
Oh, you're here at last!
- Quiet, quiet.

463
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:27,403
We were so worried. - Welcome back.
- Hello, Teresa. - All fine?

464
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,554
Oh, you went hunting!
- Really?

465
00:44:29,844 --> 00:44:34,284
You knew that my husband was a member
of a club? - Which club? - Never mind.

466
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:37,443
I never knew anything.
- These birds go in the kitchen?

467
00:44:37,478 --> 00:44:39,286
They're good with polenta.

468
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:52,389
I paid your bills and
want to know everything.

469
00:44:52,722 --> 00:44:56,163
We dined at separate tables,
as if we didn't know each other.

470
00:44:56,197 --> 00:44:58,710
Then he went in the room and ljoined him.

471
00:44:58,722 --> 00:45:02,123
And what did you do?
- Well, of course not recite the rosary.

472
00:45:03,081 --> 00:45:06,880
I don't allow you to make fun of me!
- Butl didn't mean to offend you!

473
00:45:06,916 --> 00:45:10,681
Don't scream! - Okay, but if you act so
I won't tell anything more.

474
00:45:18,001 --> 00:45:20,920
It can't be, I don't believe it!
- That's so, I tell you.

475
00:45:20,954 --> 00:45:23,275
Who told you?
- No one, I saw it myself.

476
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,697
It was a freezing afternoon,
we were to meet at the Peacock.

477
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:30,556
What is it, a hotel?
- Yes, Hotel Pavone. Well,

478
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:33,835
since it was snowing
I got there with a bit of delay,

479
00:45:34,438 --> 00:45:36,623
and found him in bed with another.

480
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,867
I was stunned.

481
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,708
Instead he calmly told me:
"It happens to who arrives late. "

482
00:45:41,717 --> 00:45:43,253
And then?
- Nothing.

483
00:45:43,278 --> 00:45:47,759
As I was shivering he told me to undress
and get under the covers with them.

484
00:45:47,793 --> 00:45:49,440
All three in the same bed?!

485
00:45:49,478 --> 00:45:53,277
Yes, but the bed was large.
We all fit into it, straight or askew.

486
00:45:53,311 --> 00:45:55,632
And then? Go on.
- We made love.

487
00:45:56,197 --> 00:45:57,994
What was that woman like?

488
00:45:58,597 --> 00:46:00,963
She had a rather strange body,

489
00:46:01,755 --> 00:46:03,880
that however gave some emotions.

490
00:46:03,916 --> 00:46:06,635
With very deep hollows near the hip bones,

491
00:46:07,076 --> 00:46:10,670
so that the belly was flat and sunken,
like that of a boy.

492
00:46:11,275 --> 00:46:15,563
The thing that struck me most
was the navel, so round. Perfect.

493
00:46:16,235 --> 00:46:20,516
The breasts instead were barely outlined,
and this made her look younger.

494
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:24,797
You knew her? - No, I know her name was
Paola and she had graduated in Padua.

495
00:46:24,954 --> 00:46:28,914
She told me of when she dissected corpses.
She said it didn't affect her.

496
00:46:28,949 --> 00:46:30,963
But imagine, men repulsed her.

497
00:46:31,114 --> 00:46:33,413
Even Luigi? - No, not him, I think.

498
00:46:33,713 --> 00:46:36,010
However, she said she was abnormal.

499
00:46:36,112 --> 00:46:38,525
She had also tried to commit suicide.

500
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:41,153
What did you do that night?
- Well,

501
00:46:41,193 --> 00:46:43,597
with you I can't be completely sincere.

502
00:46:43,632 --> 00:46:46,797
It's about my husband,
and I want to know every detail.

503
00:46:46,833 --> 00:46:51,519
He kissed her very gently, close to the
mouth, on the nostrils, on the neck...

504
00:46:51,753 --> 00:46:55,951
But she was numb to everything,
keeping her legs closed, and trembling.

505
00:46:56,351 --> 00:47:00,271
She had her eyelids lowered,
but I noticed she had her eyes,

506
00:47:00,306 --> 00:47:01,807
splendid eyes, blue,

507
00:47:02,032 --> 00:47:05,717
full of tears that fell down,
along the temples, on the hair.

508
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,340
And him?
- He too was pitiful.

509
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:13,021
This man no longer young,
kneeling next to her, patient...

510
00:47:13,911 --> 00:47:17,670
At one point, he bent down
and whispered a few words in her ear.

511
00:47:17,704 --> 00:47:19,001
What did he say?

512
00:47:19,429 --> 00:47:20,818
I couldn't hear.

513
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:26,094
I only know that as he spoke to her,
the girl's knees began to spread slowly.

514
00:47:26,668 --> 00:47:28,728
And her body slowly relaxed.

515
00:47:30,668 --> 00:47:33,023
You remained there to watch?
- Yes.

516
00:47:33,429 --> 00:47:37,273
Indeed, lparticipated the way down,
as if! had always clone it.

517
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:40,739
Haven't you felt a sense of revulsion?
- No.

518
00:47:41,148 --> 00:47:44,288
It was endearing.
And then, lliked it, too.

519
00:47:44,427 --> 00:47:46,885
Luigi was able to get anything from me,

520
00:47:46,907 --> 00:47:49,632
without this seemed to me
neither dirty nor vulgar.

521
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:52,827
This doesn't surprise me.
But I can't understand one thing:

522
00:47:52,862 --> 00:47:55,739
How did you overcome modesty?
You, especially.

523
00:47:57,106 --> 00:48:00,213
We sniffed a little ether.
- Ether? Let me see!

524
00:48:00,226 --> 00:48:03,271
No! - Give me that!
- What do you want to do?

525
00:48:03,306 --> 00:48:06,710
There isn't a word of truth
in what you said. You're a liar.

526
00:48:06,746 --> 00:48:10,027
Don't believe it? There's a bottle
like this in your husband's office.

527
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:13,347
You've been in his office,
where I never entered? - Yes.

528
00:48:13,465 --> 00:48:16,445
And we've also made love.
Just on his couch.

529
00:48:17,304 --> 00:48:19,340
Why do you strive to be cruel?

530
00:48:19,344 --> 00:48:23,190
Because I want you to betray
your husband, as I've already done.

531
00:52:58,561 --> 00:53:02,280
Watch out! Watch out!
Don't get too close, you'll burn yourself!

532
00:53:02,315 --> 00:53:06,820
Come on, come on! Look at how much stuff!
- Wait a minute!

533
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,202
Give me the other books too.
- Here you go. Grab them.

534
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,777
Poor dolls!
- Also this.

535
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:19,188
One, and two, and three.
- You hit the jackpot!

536
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,117
For this one, though, I feel a bit sorry.
- Come on, hurry up!

537
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:30,275
What a stink!
- It's the gramophone.

538
00:54:05,956 --> 00:54:09,505
No, before any intimacy,
a tea at separate tables.

539
00:54:09,835 --> 00:54:13,077
And may I know the reason
for this ceremony? - Sure.

540
00:54:13,155 --> 00:54:17,195
My husband loved to betray me this way.
- Ah, I'm an instrument of revenge.

541
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:18,525
Don't be upset.

542
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:20,684
It'll be a nice revenge!

543
00:54:21,755 --> 00:54:22,800
Eh. yes!

544
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:29,282
Yes, but we can't ignore that a Catholic
left wing movement, feeling the danger. .

545
00:54:40,992 --> 00:54:44,577
He may be a great poet,
but I find him terribly outrageous.

546
00:54:51,512 --> 00:54:55,061
Did you see who's over there?
- Where? - Down the hall.

547
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:11,697
Without restraint!

548
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:16,101
Imagine that her honest
husband idolized her.

549
00:56:11,585 --> 00:56:14,088
Nobody ever told you that you're frigid?

550
00:56:34,262 --> 00:56:38,824
Sinners! Depraved women!
Female slaves of the devil!

551
00:56:39,182 --> 00:56:43,528
When night falls, they come out of
their holes as animals from the forest.

552
00:56:43,742 --> 00:56:47,302
Or descend from the windows,
shoes in hand, as if they were thieves,

553
00:56:47,336 --> 00:56:49,190
and vanish in the darkness!

554
00:56:49,902 --> 00:56:53,382
They're going to spend the night
under other roofs!

555
00:56:53,862 --> 00:56:57,559
Clinging to men they've
seen for the first time!

556
00:56:57,701 --> 00:56:59,782
Bodies clutching bodies.

557
00:57:00,101 --> 00:57:04,083
Sweat blended with sweat,
in the embrace of sin!

558
00:57:05,701 --> 00:57:11,628
And what should I say, then, about some
men who corrupt innocent creatures?

559
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,713
And about some ladies...

560
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:21,623
who take the buggy and go looking
for pleasure in hidden streets!

561
00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:25,175
And in the towns,
where they think no one will see them!

562
00:57:25,179 --> 00:57:29,376
And give themselves up to lust
in grand hotels!

563
00:57:30,018 --> 00:57:32,157
But woe to them! Woe!

564
00:57:32,177 --> 00:57:38,298
Since they can't escape the eyes of God,
much less they'll escape his punishment!

565
00:57:39,257 --> 00:57:42,739
You know she removed all
religious images from the house?

566
00:57:43,097 --> 00:57:47,295
Saints, Madonnas, Popes... All.
She had them put down in the cellar.

567
00:57:47,657 --> 00:57:49,965
This is very serious.
- Turn around.

568
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:56,550
Knowing your ideas about religion,
I thought the news would have pleased you.

569
00:57:56,976 --> 00:58:00,923
To renounce the faith and the saints,
it takes other interests.

570
00:58:01,056 --> 00:58:05,719
It takes culture, ideals... In short,
a force that Antonia has not.

571
00:58:06,175 --> 00:58:10,315
When you married her she was a healthy girl,
and not even so religious.

572
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:15,302
You mean it's me who drove her towards the
Church? - If you didn't, you've let her go.

573
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:19,369
Because it suited you having a wife
all hearth and prayerbook,

574
00:58:19,494 --> 00:58:23,099
who awaited you quietly while you. .
were going to whores.

575
00:58:23,173 --> 00:58:27,893
Everybody knows you cheated on her since
the early months of marriage, even cruelly,

576
00:58:27,927 --> 00:58:29,894
ridiculing her every day.

577
00:58:30,172 --> 00:58:33,039
Only for her your life is a mystery.
Indeed. .

578
00:58:34,092 --> 00:58:35,639
it was a mystery.

579
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:39,860
Because now she begins to open her eyes,
and take revenge.

580
00:58:45,572 --> 00:58:48,336
Good Morning. - Morning.
- Good morning, ma'am.

581
00:58:48,371 --> 00:58:51,407
Fina, how many copies did you run?
- Hello. - Good Morning.

582
00:58:51,411 --> 00:58:54,061
How are you, ma'am? - Fine.
- Good Morning.

583
00:58:55,291 --> 00:58:56,326
Hi.

584
00:58:56,371 --> 00:59:00,010
I found other manuscripts of my husband
that are worth publishing.

585
00:59:00,045 --> 00:59:02,672
Some deal with the condition of the woman,

586
00:59:02,931 --> 00:59:06,161
others with sexual freedom.
They're very interesting.

587
00:59:06,889 --> 00:59:09,302
We publish under the name of Ulysses?

588
00:59:09,329 --> 00:59:11,172
No, with his real name.

589
00:59:13,969 --> 00:59:17,916
You go back home or stay with us to work?
- No, I can't tonight.

590
00:59:45,088 --> 00:59:47,032
Ma'am!
Excuse me...

591
00:59:50,085 --> 00:59:53,317
Can you give a lift to the doctor?
It's on your way.

592
00:59:53,407 --> 00:59:56,717
Provided I don't have to wait too long.
- No, he's coming.

593
01:00:00,246 --> 01:00:01,621
Doctor, hurry.

594
01:00:01,846 --> 01:00:04,701
I stopped a cab.
The lady is in a hurry.

595
01:00:28,443 --> 01:00:30,856
Farewell. - Good Morning. And thanks.

596
01:00:32,722 --> 01:00:35,487
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
- Never mind.

597
01:00:35,762 --> 01:00:39,039
You allow? My name is Dario Tavella.
- How do you do?

598
01:00:48,681 --> 01:00:51,798
So young, they've already
assigned you a district?

599
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,773
My colleagues refuse to live here.

600
01:00:55,362 --> 01:00:57,068
This area is too poor.

601
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,378
How can people afford to pay a doctor?

602
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:03,255
So they called me... and here I am.

603
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:08,773
What were you burying at the cemetery?
- Last night I had to amputate a leg.

604
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:14,371
That thing was the leg of a man? - Yes.
An infection that became gangrenous.

605
01:01:14,958 --> 01:01:17,335
Will he pull through?
- No.

606
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:23,130
Does he leave someone?
- Four children, a wife, and the old father.

607
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:27,088
And how will they survive,
those poor wretches?

608
01:01:27,278 --> 01:01:29,371
It will depend upon the master.

609
01:01:30,438 --> 01:01:31,882
Who's the master?

610
01:01:32,637 --> 01:01:36,505
He died, his name was Martinelli.
He was a lawyer, I think.

611
01:01:37,117 --> 01:01:40,985
Now all the lands passed to his daughter,
who never showed up.

612
01:01:42,077 --> 01:01:45,193
The houses are collapsing,
there is no aqueduct...

613
01:01:45,757 --> 01:01:48,797
There, you can say
the peasants live like animals.

614
01:01:48,831 --> 01:01:50,150
And the kids...

615
01:01:50,635 --> 01:01:53,331
all stunted.
From first to last.

616
01:01:54,076 --> 01:01:56,737
It's me the daughter of lawyer Martinelli.

617
01:01:58,076 --> 01:02:01,306
Awhile ago, didn't you say
your name is De Angelis?

618
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:03,432
It was my husband's name.

619
01:02:05,155 --> 01:02:08,431
Why didn't you ever come
to see how your farmers live?

620
01:02:08,755 --> 01:02:11,996
I've been sick in bed,
for a longtime.

621
01:02:12,275 --> 01:02:16,335
And you had no one to send?
Or you didn't care anything about them?

622
01:02:16,594 --> 01:02:20,143
What are you getting at?
- The man of the leg is dying.

623
01:02:21,954 --> 01:02:24,865
If they had taken him to the hospital,
maybe...

624
01:02:25,072 --> 01:02:28,485
maybe it wouldn't end up so.
But there are no roads.

625
01:02:28,594 --> 01:02:31,791
The roads there would be,
if my father hadn't died young.

626
01:02:31,793 --> 01:02:36,867
All of these projects were designed by him.
He meant to build houses, roads, aqueducts.

627
01:02:37,233 --> 01:02:39,382
But I only found out these days.

628
01:02:40,112 --> 01:02:43,230
I was always kept in the dark about
everything, even by my husband.

629
01:02:43,231 --> 01:02:46,507
But you knew this place.
- I used to come as a child.

630
01:02:46,791 --> 01:02:49,465
That's why I wanted to
start here my research.

631
01:02:49,472 --> 01:02:53,431
You found also the detailed study
of the project? - Yes, it's complete.

632
01:02:53,465 --> 01:02:54,762
How do you know?

633
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:58,802
It was revised two years ago.
My husband had resumed it.

634
01:02:59,911 --> 01:03:03,380
And then?
- He dropped it, like so many other things.

635
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:07,724
New homes, barns,
rational silos, irrigation canals...

636
01:03:08,309 --> 01:03:10,152
Even the electricity grid.

637
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:13,849
It's no joke doing all these things.
- Perhaps.

638
01:03:14,349 --> 01:03:16,500
But I don't settle for dreaming.

639
01:03:16,829 --> 01:03:19,103
And then?
Come on, speak.

640
01:03:20,869 --> 01:03:22,951
She gave the go to the works.

641
01:03:23,349 --> 01:03:27,648
She's hired fifty workers, and they're
making roads, aqueducts and canals.

642
01:03:27,949 --> 01:03:29,132
It's madness!

643
01:03:30,027 --> 01:03:32,326
She's only realizing your projects.

644
01:03:34,947 --> 01:03:36,222
But, the money?

645
01:03:37,427 --> 01:03:41,715
She took money from the bank,
sold the shares inherited from her father,

646
01:03:41,907 --> 01:03:46,195
and... - This physician, what is he?
A sly guy? A cheater?

647
01:03:47,186 --> 01:03:51,532
No. No, no, he's a very reserved guy,
with rather advanced ideas.

648
01:03:52,425 --> 01:03:55,474
Oh, forgot: they've also set up a clinic,

649
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:57,753
for checkups to poor children.

650
01:03:58,144 --> 01:04:02,605
Houses, aqueducts, roads, clinic...
But what is this frenzy?

651
01:04:03,864 --> 01:04:06,945
Come on, tell me the truth.
What's between those two?

652
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:10,175
But, I don't know.
Maybe a friendship bond.

653
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,550
Friendship...

654
01:04:15,943 --> 01:04:17,730
Is he married?
- No.

655
01:04:18,224 --> 01:04:21,454
Indeed, it seems that he's
a young man a bit strange.

656
01:04:21,864 --> 01:04:25,641
What does it mean, a bit strange?
- Very shy, closed.

657
01:04:26,744 --> 01:04:29,451
Someone even says he has some tendencies.

658
01:04:30,862 --> 01:04:31,978
Homosexual?

659
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:35,583
They're suspicions.
It seems he's even undergone a trial.

660
01:04:36,222 --> 01:04:38,737
A trial does not mean anything.

661
01:04:39,862 --> 01:04:42,820
I'm sorry for Antonia.
No, honestly.

662
01:04:43,822 --> 01:04:48,099
Maybe it's right that she too
finds a glimmer, a...

663
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,902
You play the father role now?

664
01:04:55,021 --> 01:04:59,208
I treated a 16 year old boy,
of very poor family,

665
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:01,990
suffering from severe mental disorders.

666
01:05:02,019 --> 01:05:05,114
I suspected that his illness was related

667
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:10,157
to guilt complexes for some sexual
practices, normal in boys his age.

668
01:05:11,179 --> 01:05:15,114
So I questioned him on the subject.
- Was that why you were put on trial?

669
01:05:15,259 --> 01:05:16,351
No.

670
01:05:16,619 --> 01:05:19,326
The charge was to have abused my profession

671
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:22,114
just to achieve quite different purposes.

672
01:05:22,657 --> 01:05:24,137
I don't understand.

673
01:05:24,179 --> 01:05:27,090
Of what did they accuse you?
- Homosexuality.

674
01:05:29,137 --> 01:05:31,844
And on what evidence was based this belief?

675
01:05:32,538 --> 01:05:37,065
First, on having treated, him for a
few months without asking for a penny.

676
01:05:37,297 --> 01:05:39,300
And on what else?
- Slander.

677
01:05:39,737 --> 01:05:44,106
They said it was me who had driven
the boy to masturbate. - And instead?

678
01:05:44,257 --> 01:05:48,454
His idiot aunt had terrorized him
by saying he'd end up in a madhouse.

679
01:05:48,657 --> 01:05:50,545
I told him it was not true,

680
01:05:50,815 --> 01:05:53,967
and not to feel guilty about
something so normal.

681
01:05:54,615 --> 01:05:58,896
But you're really sure that the sense of
guilt is more harmful than the guilt itself?

682
01:05:58,929 --> 01:06:02,012
You've spent your adolescence
in a school of nuns.

683
01:06:02,135 --> 01:06:03,875
I think you should know.

684
01:06:04,175 --> 01:06:08,065
By guilt, I mean not feeling pleasure
in the touch of your husband,

685
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:11,907
and instead seeking it in a dream,
in a memory. . by yourself.

686
01:06:11,942 --> 01:06:15,559
Don't think you're a unique case.
Even many peasant women,

687
01:06:15,653 --> 01:06:17,496
married and with children,

688
01:06:17,813 --> 01:06:22,023
seeing themselves used as things
that don't deserve trust or respect,

689
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:26,155
suffer the man.
Without however reaching orgasm.

690
01:06:26,452 --> 01:06:30,708
This is the first time I feel regarded
as a person capable of reasoning.

691
01:06:32,132 --> 01:06:34,635
Even as a girl I dealt with this issue,

692
01:06:34,931 --> 01:06:37,695
but nobody ever allowed me to talk about it.

693
01:06:37,891 --> 01:06:39,951
Not even your husband?
- Never.

694
01:06:39,972 --> 01:06:42,496
I thought he was a modern man,
unprejudiced.

695
01:06:42,532 --> 01:06:47,161
Sure! But with the other women, or in
his secret writings. But with me, no way!

696
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:51,610
Maybe he avoided these issues intuiting
that certain words would excite me,

697
01:06:51,646 --> 01:06:55,451
provoke in me desires, and
this was a threat to marital fidelity.

698
01:06:55,485 --> 01:06:58,065
Words really do have this power over you?

699
01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:02,237
In order to be sincere,
I should tell you a lie.

700
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:03,911
You mean?

701
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:08,570
If I admitted that your closeness,
and the speeches that we had,

702
01:07:08,605 --> 01:07:12,005
have aroused me only a bit,
it would be like minimizing,

703
01:07:12,009 --> 01:07:15,126
giving a petty sense
to what's going on inside me.

704
01:07:42,126 --> 01:07:43,764
The horse has stopped.

705
01:07:44,887 --> 01:07:46,422
Go on!

706
01:07:48,525 --> 01:07:49,652
Come on!

707
01:07:52,326 --> 01:07:56,581
Maybe they have two free rooms.
Do we stop to sleep here? - No, I can't.

708
01:07:57,605 --> 01:08:01,826
I'll take you myself to the clinic tomorrow.
- No, really, not the case.

709
01:08:02,605 --> 01:08:05,289
Come on!
Come on, go!

710
01:08:05,565 --> 01:08:06,998
What's the matter?

711
01:08:08,324 --> 01:08:11,963
If the horse doesn't start,
that means it used to stop here.

712
01:08:12,204 --> 01:08:16,005
I know this hotel, it's something
very similar to a brothel.

713
01:08:16,524 --> 01:08:20,005
If you say it for me, I don't care.
- I'm here, I'm here!

714
01:08:21,083 --> 01:08:23,404
See what weather?
Please, ma'am.

715
01:08:24,323 --> 01:08:27,485
Toni, Toni, the luggage! Move!
- Right away.

716
01:08:28,122 --> 01:08:32,167
You're Mrs. De Angelis, right? - Yes, why?
- I recognized your horse.

717
01:08:32,203 --> 01:08:36,722
You know, your husband was one of our
guests. A person such as there are few.

718
01:08:36,756 --> 01:08:39,337
I'll give you a nice room with a balcony.

719
01:08:39,561 --> 01:08:40,756
Here you go.

720
01:08:41,082 --> 01:08:43,606
The same that I always
gave to your husband.

721
01:08:43,641 --> 01:08:46,815
For you there's a smaller one
but on the same floor.

722
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:51,497
No, enough for me. But another glass
to my granddaughter. - Yes, sir.

723
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:55,578
You're quite sly, Grandpa!
- You've noticed, eh?

724
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,046
That lady is a prostitute, right?

725
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:11,885
Look, she rubs up like a cat.
You find her interesting?

726
01:09:11,918 --> 01:09:15,338
You know, in this hotel stayed George Sand,
who was in love with Chopin,

727
01:09:15,373 --> 01:09:18,759
and De Musset chased them all over Europe. .
- I want to sleep with you.

728
01:09:18,792 --> 01:09:20,578
. . like a. . madman.

729
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:16,706
Let's try to get at least to the room,
please.

730
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:30,421
Lawyer.

731
01:10:33,472 --> 01:10:35,975
My cousin is waiting upstairs.
- Good.

732
01:10:38,072 --> 01:10:40,957
You don't run any more risk,
they found the killer.

733
01:10:40,992 --> 01:10:44,189
Here. Luckily he confessed.
Come on, get out of this room.

734
01:10:44,391 --> 01:10:45,881
You need care now.

735
01:10:46,110 --> 01:10:48,113
You're in a state...
- Well.

736
01:10:48,951 --> 01:10:51,988
Thank you.
- I don't understand, aren't you glad?

737
01:10:51,989 --> 01:10:55,163
You don't mean to do
the voluntary recluse, I hope?

738
01:10:55,470 --> 01:10:59,055
Look, among other things your wife is
signing bills, selling shares, asking loans..

739
01:10:59,069 --> 01:11:03,324
She's buying anothertypographic machine.
She even published a lot ofyourwritings.

740
01:11:04,109 --> 01:11:08,206
And then... And then there's her
relationship with that young doctor.

741
01:11:08,748 --> 01:11:10,228
Change the subject.

742
01:11:14,309 --> 01:11:18,574
Look, returning from Padova days ago,
I stopped at the hotel Pavone.

743
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:20,801
A sort of brothel, remember?

744
01:11:22,188 --> 01:11:27,056
As I descended the stairs I heard some sighs,
on the landing, in the dim light.

745
01:11:27,467 --> 01:11:31,916
There were a man and a woman, embracing.
He had her against the wall.

746
01:11:32,068 --> 01:11:34,536
Kissing her, touching her...

747
01:11:35,707 --> 01:11:40,052
At some point she, bent on her knees,
as if she couldn't resist the desire.

748
01:11:40,707 --> 01:11:43,470
"Let's try to get to the room", she told him.

749
01:11:43,867 --> 01:11:47,894
In her voice there was so much sensuality
that it left me upset.

750
01:11:49,065 --> 01:11:50,340
And who was it?

751
01:11:50,865 --> 01:11:53,938
Well, the landing was very dark, but...
- But?

752
01:11:55,864 --> 01:12:00,506
Next morning, while I was paying the bill,
I saw there, in a living room, . .

753
01:12:01,864 --> 01:12:05,140
your wife,
who was playing cards with a prostitute.

754
01:12:07,104 --> 01:12:11,369
And who of the two was on the landing?
Certainly not Antonia.

755
01:12:12,304 --> 01:12:16,899
She's incapable of this kind of abandon.
Her frigidity has been our drama.

756
01:12:17,264 --> 01:12:21,802
Look, Luigi, I'm notjust your lawyer,
I am also your friend.

757
01:12:22,943 --> 01:12:26,457
Antonia and that young doctor
are in that hotel from a week.

758
01:12:26,622 --> 01:12:31,412
They are night and day in bed,
just in that room that you know well.

759
01:12:31,823 --> 01:12:34,074
They come down only for meals.

760
01:12:34,381 --> 01:12:39,546
She's madly in love. She discovered
something that swept her like a hurricane.

761
01:12:41,461 --> 01:12:42,894
Get out, now!

762
01:12:45,221 --> 01:12:47,884
Log out of this hole before it's too late.

763
01:13:14,059 --> 01:13:15,595
Good morning, ma'am.

764
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:19,201
You had a good journey?
- Excellent, thanks.

765
01:13:19,858 --> 01:13:22,212
Itake it to the stable?
- Yes, go.

766
01:13:24,457 --> 01:13:26,483
Feed it.
- Yes, right away.

767
01:13:35,976 --> 01:13:38,434
Thirty. . forty...

768
01:13:39,256 --> 01:13:40,792
Good morning, ma'am.

769
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:44,609
Hello, Antonia.
I didn't know you were back.

770
01:13:47,336 --> 01:13:49,554
Since when you learned to smoke?

771
01:13:50,775 --> 01:13:52,528
Well. . a few months.

772
01:13:53,536 --> 01:13:56,243
You know, as we age we
take up so many vices. .

773
01:13:56,774 --> 01:13:57,844
Bye.

774
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:00,805
Also for you Xanthia as usual?

775
01:14:22,453 --> 01:14:25,091
What's wrong, ma'am, don't you feel well?

776
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:53,796
Why didn't you go somewhere else
to buy cigarettes?

777
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:59,100
What are you worried about?
Didn't you hear what the lawyer said?

778
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:01,342
Antonia has it all figured out.

779
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:06,462
What do I represent now here for her?
A dead weight. .

780
01:15:06,689 --> 01:15:07,859
an obstacle.

781
01:15:08,009 --> 01:15:12,354
You won't tell me you're afraid that
she'll report you, to get rid of you?

782
01:15:12,448 --> 01:15:13,984
I wish she'd do it!

783
01:15:14,649 --> 01:15:18,368
This way I could stop
staying behind that window

784
01:15:18,403 --> 01:15:22,054
to witness her total. . corruption.

785
01:15:23,807 --> 01:15:28,096
You don't deem yourself a corrupt man, eh?
- What's that got to do with it?

786
01:15:29,207 --> 01:15:33,735
I have betrayed Antonia, it is true,
with many whores. But you know why!

787
01:15:34,167 --> 01:15:38,627
And anyway, inside, I've always
remained wholesome. - She, instead, no?

788
01:15:39,046 --> 01:15:40,842
For women it's different.

789
01:15:41,605 --> 01:15:44,063
But why do you defend her so much? Eh?

790
01:15:44,246 --> 01:15:47,750
What is it, after so long,
you're still in love?

791
01:15:47,845 --> 01:15:51,725
I've always had affection and
admiration for you. - In love!

792
01:15:53,005 --> 01:15:56,512
That's why in all these years
you always avoided me.

793
01:15:56,548 --> 01:16:00,021
Yes, admiration for what you said,
for what you wrote...

794
01:16:00,524 --> 01:16:04,939
But now I realized they were just
pretty words that filled your mouth.

795
01:16:05,045 --> 01:16:06,524
And your conscience.

796
01:16:07,003 --> 01:16:09,586
You're still in love with Antonia.

797
01:16:11,203 --> 01:16:14,867
I loved her so much...
that you can't even imagine.

798
01:16:16,043 --> 01:16:19,649
Get in line.
Sooner or later it will also be your turn.

799
01:16:22,722 --> 01:16:23,849
Vincenzo.

800
01:16:28,403 --> 01:16:31,679
They're horrible, you know,
these sleepless nights, . .

801
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:34,390
with in the eyes the haunting image

802
01:16:35,162 --> 01:16:37,766
of your wife in the arms of another man

803
01:16:38,561 --> 01:16:40,882
in a dingy hallway of a hotel

804
01:16:41,801 --> 01:16:43,484
with rooms by the hour.

805
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,865
Enough now, stop it, don't think about it.
Give me the thermometer.

806
01:17:11,717 --> 01:17:14,960
That's it. It's known to my wife,
my lawyer, . .

807
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:18,613
and now also the doctor knows
that I am hidden here.

808
01:17:18,637 --> 01:17:21,823
I had to call him.
You've raved all night.

809
01:17:22,078 --> 01:17:24,329
I believe it. With that infection!

810
01:17:24,597 --> 01:17:28,466
Well. You'll see that after the incision
you'll be soon better.

811
01:17:28,476 --> 01:17:30,069
It's nothing serious.

812
01:17:30,317 --> 01:17:33,149
Now, though, relax, eh?
Keep Calm.

813
01:17:33,157 --> 01:17:37,207
You'll see, soon you'll fall asleep
and you won't feel anything more.

814
01:17:38,756 --> 01:17:41,965
Doctor, the one they've killed...

815
01:17:43,356 --> 01:17:44,596
I was there.

816
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:49,052
Go ahead and denounce me, if you want.

817
01:17:49,756 --> 01:17:52,657
By now, I don't care about anything more.

818
01:17:53,475 --> 01:17:57,114
Don't worry. I haven't heard
a single word of what you said.

819
01:17:57,194 --> 01:18:00,220
And then you have a high fever,
you're delirious.

820
01:18:05,073 --> 01:18:06,393
How about that!

821
01:18:07,354 --> 01:18:11,221
It would have been better
to take him to hospital. - Yes I know.

822
01:18:11,793 --> 01:18:13,681
But what I don't understand

823
01:18:13,872 --> 01:18:17,582
is why he wants to stay hidden
now that there is no more danger.

824
01:18:17,832 --> 01:18:19,983
Now he's just afraid to live.

825
01:18:21,033 --> 01:18:23,444
Hello, Mr. Vincenzo.
- Good Morning.

826
01:18:25,912 --> 01:18:27,380
My respects.
- Again.

827
01:18:30,231 --> 01:18:34,631
Where? - Below. - I signed, but
I didn't understand what. - Rest assured.

828
01:18:34,666 --> 01:18:39,029
It's my turn? - Yes. - I didn't
understand what it is. - Sign anyway.

829
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:43,270
At your orders. - We must admit that
women, when they want something,

830
01:18:43,305 --> 01:18:45,478
are far more tenacious than us men.

831
01:18:45,511 --> 01:18:48,685
This is still nothing.
You'll see how many initiatives!

832
01:19:05,069 --> 01:19:07,322
What happens?
What is this party?

833
01:19:07,948 --> 01:19:12,628
She's collecting signatures to create a
service center or something like that.

834
01:19:12,662 --> 01:19:14,265
I didn't quite get it.

835
01:19:14,507 --> 01:19:18,238
It's incredible! She intruded among
my friends, among my women.

836
01:19:18,387 --> 01:19:21,747
She's wiping me out from her life
with an ease that I never imagined.

837
01:19:21,783 --> 01:19:23,488
As if I'd never existed!

838
01:20:08,224 --> 01:20:10,818
Finally! You're the last ones.
- Evening.

839
01:20:10,823 --> 01:20:13,530
We need your signatures.
You said you'd be punctual.

840
01:20:13,543 --> 01:20:15,807
Who's that?
- A snag with my mother.

841
01:20:15,823 --> 01:20:19,260
And you, doctor, what's your excuse?
- He has no excuse.

842
01:20:19,863 --> 01:20:22,935
Well, one is Clara's boyfriend.
- No, the other.

843
01:20:23,381 --> 01:20:24,497
That's him.

844
01:20:24,662 --> 01:20:27,722
Him who?
- The doctor. The friend of Antonia.

845
01:20:33,301 --> 01:20:37,625
That's it. - To be honest, I found
the meeting a little boring. - No way!

846
01:20:37,701 --> 01:20:40,465
The eternal opposer.
- I oppose male abuse!

847
01:20:40,862 --> 01:20:45,301
I'm only interested in the why, not the how.
- And I the when. - Okay, when what?

848
01:20:45,336 --> 01:20:47,757
There, see that you're a baby?
- Ugh!

849
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:51,979
So I have your word.

850
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:56,765
I'll keep my promise. - Tomorrow I'll come
to help you. - Great, Clara! Don't forget!

851
01:20:57,378 --> 01:20:58,470
Dario...

852
01:21:01,458 --> 01:21:02,551
Stay.

853
01:21:03,659 --> 01:21:07,038
What's written?
- Nothing, it's just a business card.

854
01:21:07,498 --> 01:21:08,726
I want to see.

855
01:21:09,179 --> 01:21:11,841
Leave. - I want to see.
- You're hurting me.

856
01:21:11,859 --> 01:21:14,009
Please!
I told you to leave me!

857
01:21:20,618 --> 01:21:21,720
Dario!

858
01:21:33,775 --> 01:21:37,416
It's no longer my wife that I'm spying on.
It's a new woman.

859
01:21:38,416 --> 01:21:42,671
I should go away, but...
but there is something that prevents me.

860
01:21:42,895 --> 01:21:45,671
She's there, alive, free, passionate.

861
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:49,568
And it's this Antonia
that I want to get to know.

862
01:21:49,774 --> 01:21:54,484
I also wondered if it's my morbid imagination
that pushes me into this game. No.

863
01:21:55,654 --> 01:21:59,011
It's my bewilderment facing
the fact that she is fulfilled

864
01:21:59,253 --> 01:22:00,686
outside of me.

865
01:22:03,694 --> 01:22:05,889
Now I live, through her lovers,

866
01:22:06,694 --> 01:22:09,082
what before, instead with her,

867
01:22:09,893 --> 01:22:11,940
I've not been capable to live.

868
01:22:12,012 --> 01:22:14,880
For this, you know,
I can't go away from here.

869
01:22:15,212 --> 01:22:17,351
I want to go through with it,

870
01:22:17,932 --> 01:22:20,845
understand everything,
see everything...

871
01:22:21,452 --> 01:22:22,520
and then...

872
01:22:46,850 --> 01:22:48,693
Why did you bring me here?

873
01:22:49,010 --> 01:22:50,488
lwant you to know.

874
01:22:50,649 --> 01:22:52,470
I'm following my path.

875
01:22:53,930 --> 01:22:55,203
Up to the end.

876
01:23:57,564 --> 01:23:59,407
Why did you agree to come?

877
01:23:59,604 --> 01:24:03,494
Where has passed Ulysses can also
pass Penelope. - Then you knew.

878
01:24:03,644 --> 01:24:08,421
Paola told me about your meetings,
but knowing doesn't mean understanding.

879
01:24:08,563 --> 01:24:10,917
Women tend to complicate everything,

880
01:24:10,922 --> 01:24:13,835
ﬁrst with the sentiment
and then with reasoning.

881
01:24:13,842 --> 01:24:17,688
Even eroticism you want it to have a reason,
even its own logic.

882
01:24:18,722 --> 01:24:20,259
What is it, instead?

883
01:24:20,443 --> 01:24:24,515
I have never asked myself,
I just want to enjoy life.

884
01:24:25,282 --> 01:24:28,364
And what did Luigi want?
- To forget.

885
01:24:30,122 --> 01:24:34,377
To hide himself, which he didn't love,
behind an image always different.

886
01:24:34,921 --> 01:24:39,221
Why don't you just say that he always
deceived all those he's had close?

887
01:24:39,801 --> 01:24:43,350
Yet everyone remember him, defend him.
They love him even.

888
01:24:43,881 --> 01:24:47,703
Only I am unable to forgive him.
I'm not capable.

889
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,311
The most strange thing is that

890
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,426
you're talking as if
your husband were alive.

891
01:24:53,878 --> 01:24:57,599
I wish he was, to give him back
all the evil he's done to me,

892
01:24:58,359 --> 01:24:59,895
that he keeps doing.

893
01:25:00,519 --> 01:25:03,750
You hate him so much that
you're still in love with him.

894
01:25:04,519 --> 01:25:06,487
With whom you're in love?

895
01:25:21,596 --> 01:25:24,885
But... But why?
- This way you're more handsome.

896
01:25:28,197 --> 01:25:30,813
I have little time.
- What does it take?

897
01:25:31,957 --> 01:25:34,551
It's us, ma'am.
- Come. Come on in.

898
01:25:37,956 --> 01:25:41,868
We brought the mail, and dragées.
- Thanks. Sit down, please.

899
01:25:41,916 --> 01:25:45,476
I should... - Sit down.
- So you're getting married at last.

900
01:25:47,314 --> 01:25:50,625
Yes, tomorrow morning.
- I'm glad, really.

901
01:25:53,835 --> 01:25:56,132
I didn't come just for the dragées.

902
01:25:56,755 --> 01:25:59,715
I also wanted to ask you for a gift.
- Of course.

903
01:25:59,748 --> 01:26:01,203
Please, be good,

904
01:26:01,394 --> 01:26:05,038
come to church tomorrow. I know you
don't want to set foot there again.

905
01:26:05,073 --> 01:26:08,993
Even if I didn't come, I'd be equally close
to you. With all my heart, believe me.

906
01:26:09,028 --> 01:26:12,672
I'm convinced like you that are
spiritual values that count, but. .

907
01:26:12,707 --> 01:26:15,698
Which ones, for example?
- Honesty, sincerity...

908
01:26:17,153 --> 01:26:18,791
and also purity.

909
01:26:20,311 --> 01:26:23,337
We need to establish
what you mean by this word.

910
01:26:23,591 --> 01:26:25,912
The world and nature are so material,

911
01:26:25,952 --> 01:26:29,512
that perhaps purity and innocence
only make us unfit to life.

912
01:26:29,631 --> 01:26:32,395
I, however, think they are a great strength.

913
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:35,270
And right before you,
who have the courage of your opinions,

914
01:26:35,305 --> 01:26:38,104
I want to tell Clara something I never told.

915
01:26:38,109 --> 01:26:42,079
Clara must know that I've never had
intercourse with a woman,

916
01:26:42,591 --> 01:26:45,457
and, in order not to
contaminate her purity, I

917
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:48,222
have come virgin
to the marriage with her.

918
01:26:55,869 --> 01:26:58,225
Excuse me dear, then you'll join me.

919
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:00,806
Good evening, ma'am.
- Best wishes, Enrico.

920
01:27:02,988 --> 01:27:05,867
What will you tell him when he
finds out that you're not a virgin?

921
01:27:05,868 --> 01:27:10,305
I'll tell him what your husband said:
''It happens to who arrives too late. "

922
01:27:24,106 --> 01:27:25,460
Like that!

923
01:27:26,667 --> 01:27:28,362
Hold it!
Go!

924
01:33:23,877 --> 01:33:26,345
Why did you betray me?
- It happens.

925
01:33:35,435 --> 01:33:38,302
I want you to come live with me.
Forever.

926
01:33:41,595 --> 01:33:45,850
I can no longer do without you.
I need to know that you're just mine.

927
01:33:46,114 --> 01:33:48,367
I'll no longer be anyone's, ever.

928
01:34:25,752 --> 01:34:27,435
Now we are even.

929
01:34:46,029 --> 01:34:49,988
It was a shot! - A shot?
- But where?

930
01:35:25,226 --> 01:35:26,306
Why?

931
01:36:14,742 --> 01:36:17,154
Good Morning.
- Good morning, Clara.

932
01:36:24,702 --> 01:36:28,922
Take it. I would have brought it shortly.
It's from Mrs. Antonia.

933
01:36:29,381 --> 01:36:30,416
Thanks.

934
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:37,006
"Luigi De Angelis yet to be found. "
..Why?..

935
01:36:38,301 --> 01:36:41,440
Set for two, tonight.
- For two? - Yes.

936
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:43,948
I'll probably have a guest.
