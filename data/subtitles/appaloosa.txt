1
00:01:19,316 --> 00:01:22,682
Randall, I'm afraid I gotta take
two of your boys back into town with me.

2
00:01:22,853 --> 00:01:25,549
You're outside your jurisdiction, marshal.

3
00:01:25,722 --> 00:01:28,055
And you're trespassing on my land.

4
00:01:28,224 --> 00:01:32,058
They murdered that fellow from Chicago,
and then they raped and killed his wife.

5
00:01:32,228 --> 00:01:34,128
I'm taking them in.

6
00:01:37,768 --> 00:01:39,167
No.

7
00:01:39,335 --> 00:01:40,825
I can't spare them.

8
00:01:54,317 --> 00:01:57,228
Them two on the end.
Cut them out.

9
00:02:00,123 --> 00:02:01,819
Do like I tell you.

10
00:02:59,783 --> 00:03:03,810
<i>Like my father, I'd been West Point,
and I was good at soldiering.</i>

11
00:03:03,986 --> 00:03:07,615
<i>But soldiering didn't allow
for much expansion of the soul.</i>

12
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,454
<i>So after the War Between the States
and a year of fighting Indians...</i>

13
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:16,429
<i>... I turned in my commission and rode away
to see how much I could expand it.</i>

14
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,429
<i>First time I met Virgil Cole
was when I and my eight-gauge...</i>

15
00:03:20,603 --> 00:03:22,730
<i>... backed him up in a showdown
he was having...</i>

16
00:03:22,906 --> 00:03:24,998
<i>... with some drunken mountain men.</i>

17
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:28,167
<i>Virgil asked me on the spot
if I'd care to partner up with him...</i>

18
00:03:28,344 --> 00:03:30,574
<i>... and his peacekeeping business.</i>

19
00:03:30,747 --> 00:03:35,013
<i>Which is why I was with him now,
and why I still carry the eight-gauge.</i>

20
00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:40,082
<i>We'd been keeping the peace together
for the last dozen years or so.</i>

21
00:03:40,557 --> 00:03:43,788
<i>And as we looked down on a town called Appaloosa...</i>

22
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:46,656
<i>... I had no reason to doubt
that we'd be doing just that...</i>

23
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:49,127
<i>... for the foreseeable future.</i>

24
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:54,795
<i>But life has a way of making the foreseeable
that which never happens...</i>

25
00:03:54,972 --> 00:03:59,602
<i>... and the unforeseeable
that which your life becomes.</i>

26
00:04:21,697 --> 00:04:24,860
The black hat. Must be Cole.

27
00:04:28,872 --> 00:04:30,499
They're here.

28
00:04:34,644 --> 00:04:36,112
Howdy.

29
00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:41,316
Jack Bell and his deputies went up to Bragg's place...

30
00:04:41,485 --> 00:04:43,884
...to arrest the men
that murdered Clayton Poston...

31
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:45,646
...and raped and killed his wife.

32
00:04:45,822 --> 00:04:49,689
And Jack Bell and his deputies were never seen again.

33
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,819
I knew Jack Bell. He was a good man.

34
00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:55,827
This fella, Bragg...

35
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:58,264
...what's his story?

36
00:04:58,435 --> 00:05:00,163
He says he's from New York City.

37
00:05:00,336 --> 00:05:04,706
Claims that he worked with Chester Arthur
in the customs office up there.

38
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,036
Chester Arthur, President of the United States?

39
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:09,440
That's what Bragg claims.

40
00:05:09,612 --> 00:05:11,170
What the hell's he doing out here?

41
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:13,043
- He's after the copper fields.
- Earl.

42
00:05:13,216 --> 00:05:14,843
- What?
- Let Abner speak, please.

43
00:05:15,018 --> 00:05:16,542
He is speaking.

44
00:05:18,454 --> 00:05:22,824
The mines shut down back in '75
because of the Apache problem.

45
00:05:22,992 --> 00:05:24,153
We finally made a deal...

46
00:05:24,327 --> 00:05:27,387
...with a company out of Chicago
to get the operation going again.

47
00:05:27,564 --> 00:05:28,656
A fair deal, mind you.

48
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:31,459
Then this murdering scoundrel turns up and...

49
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:32,966
- Phil.
- What?

50
00:05:33,136 --> 00:05:36,298
Our investors pulled out right after the killings.

51
00:05:36,473 --> 00:05:39,670
Bragg and his men have got us all running scared.

52
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:43,276
They buy supplies in my store and they don't pay for them.

53
00:05:43,747 --> 00:05:44,906
They harass our women.

54
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:47,744
They use horses from the livery and don't bring them back.

55
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:50,317
They eat and drink whatever they like and never pay.

56
00:05:50,487 --> 00:05:54,855
They've been living off of us
like coyotes live off a buffalo carcass.

57
00:05:55,024 --> 00:05:57,891
Everything that eats meat likes a dead buffalo.

58
00:06:03,966 --> 00:06:05,935
Mr. Cole, Mr. Hitch...

59
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:10,937
...we want our town back,
and we are ready to pay your price.

60
00:06:13,076 --> 00:06:14,838
What do you allow, Everett?

61
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:19,707
- What we do.
- It is, ain't it?

62
00:06:21,184 --> 00:06:23,084
Then you'll do it?

63
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:26,454
- Sure.
- Oh, thank God.

64
00:06:26,622 --> 00:06:28,214
Mr. Cole and I will do the gun work...

65
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:31,451
...but we're gonna button the town up
tighter than a nun's corset.

66
00:06:31,627 --> 00:06:33,459
We need you to make laws we can enforce.

67
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:34,961
We got laws.

68
00:06:35,132 --> 00:06:39,625
You're gonna have more.
We need a lot of laws to make it all legal.

69
00:06:39,903 --> 00:06:44,271
Well, sure. I mean, if it seems reasonable,
we'll just put them right into the bylaws.

70
00:06:44,441 --> 00:06:47,170
- No.
- No what?

71
00:06:56,853 --> 00:07:00,788
It basically states
that whatever Mr. Cole says is law.

72
00:07:01,158 --> 00:07:04,321
- This means you'd be running the town.
- It does.

73
00:07:04,494 --> 00:07:06,654
We can't have that.

74
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:10,932
I mean, you're asking us, so to speak,
to turn the town over to you.

75
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,432
Far as I can see, you're gonna turn it over anyway.

76
00:07:13,603 --> 00:07:15,502
- Us or Bragg.
- Mr. Raines.

77
00:07:15,672 --> 00:07:17,161
Not now, Tilda.

78
00:07:17,341 --> 00:07:19,172
- Trouble in the bar, Mr. Raines.
- Tilda.

79
00:07:19,343 --> 00:07:21,572
- It's Mr. Bragg's men.
- Oh, Jesus, God.

80
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:24,305
There's four of them. They have guns.

81
00:07:27,584 --> 00:07:31,485
Space for your signature down at the bottom, gentlemen.

82
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:33,245
Oh, for God's sake, give me that.

83
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,649
So...

84
00:07:47,803 --> 00:07:49,634
Sign the damn thing, Abner...

85
00:07:49,805 --> 00:07:52,673
...so these men can do
what they came here to do.

86
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:21,762
You piss like a mare, Chalk.

87
00:08:22,471 --> 00:08:25,338
Fat, give me another one.

88
00:08:33,517 --> 00:08:35,144
Button them up.

89
00:08:38,855 --> 00:08:42,381
- Who the fuck are you?
- Virgil Cole.

90
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:44,549
Virgil Cole?

91
00:08:45,995 --> 00:08:47,691
No shit.

92
00:08:48,264 --> 00:08:51,894
Hey, Chalk, Virgil Cole wants us to button up.

93
00:08:53,702 --> 00:08:57,832
Step a little closer, Virgil Cole,
and I'll piss in your pocket.

94
00:08:58,841 --> 00:09:02,744
Fellas, I'm the new city marshal.
Put it away or lose it.

95
00:09:02,913 --> 00:09:06,849
- Hey, Bronc, they got a new city marshal.
- Put your little contraptions away.

96
00:09:07,017 --> 00:09:10,817
I'm gonna walk you down to the jailhouse.
I don't wanna spook the horses.

97
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:23,120
You ain't walking us nowhere, Virgil Cole.

98
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,868
You pull on me, either one of you...

99
00:09:28,238 --> 00:09:29,261
...I'll kill you both.

100
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,631
Bullshit.

101
00:09:39,349 --> 00:09:43,046
I ain't shooting, mister. I ain't shooting.

102
00:09:46,755 --> 00:09:48,746
Give me your gun.

103
00:10:06,743 --> 00:10:08,073
I warned them.

104
00:10:42,245 --> 00:10:44,838
- Marshal.
- Morning, Mr. Olson.

105
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:48,279
Bragg and his men, some of them
were at the jail looking for you, sir.

106
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:50,179
Well, I ain't at the jail.

107
00:10:50,352 --> 00:10:53,048
Yes, I can see that.

108
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,482
Get a better view of what's going on
sitting right here, don't we, Everett?

109
00:10:58,794 --> 00:11:00,125
Mm-hm.

110
00:11:00,462 --> 00:11:02,192
What should we do?

111
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:06,163
- About what?
- Well, about Bragg and his men.

112
00:11:06,336 --> 00:11:08,065
Don't do nothing, Phil.

113
00:11:08,238 --> 00:11:10,000
Oh, my God.

114
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:31,822
My name's Randall Bragg.

115
00:11:31,995 --> 00:11:33,690
Virgil Cole.

116
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:38,090
I know who you are.

117
00:11:41,403 --> 00:11:42,769
We need to talk.

118
00:11:42,938 --> 00:11:44,873
The only thing I need from you...

119
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,308
...is what happened to Jack Bell.

120
00:11:48,611 --> 00:11:50,773
Can't help you there, marshal.

121
00:11:53,515 --> 00:11:55,984
I see the fellow with the shotgun there.

122
00:11:56,152 --> 00:11:57,948
Eight-gauge.

123
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:01,948
Good idea, spreading out like that.

124
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,716
It is.

125
00:12:09,499 --> 00:12:12,990
- You a drinking man, marshal?
- Not so much.

126
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,961
And, uh, Mr. Eight-Gauge over there?

127
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:18,129
Mr. Everett Hitch.

128
00:12:18,942 --> 00:12:20,875
You a drinking man, Everett?

129
00:12:21,043 --> 00:12:23,011
Not so much.

130
00:12:25,048 --> 00:12:27,243
Hard to like a man who doesn't drink a little.

131
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:29,647
But not impossible.

132
00:12:30,986 --> 00:12:33,511
Well, we'll see.

133
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:42,260
- You shot three of my men.
- Matter of fact, I only shot two.

134
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:43,922
Mr. Hitch shot the other one.

135
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,559
Point is, I can't have my hands
coming in here and you boys shooting them.

136
00:12:48,738 --> 00:12:50,330
I can see how you'd feel that way.

137
00:12:50,506 --> 00:12:53,374
So we need to make an arrangement.

138
00:12:53,543 --> 00:12:55,100
There's a set of bylaws...

139
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:58,441
...posted right outside the door here
of this very saloon.

140
00:12:58,615 --> 00:13:01,846
<i>Your boys do like the bylaws say,
everything will be muy bueno.</i>

141
00:13:03,653 --> 00:13:06,383
- And if they don't?
- I arrest them.

142
00:13:06,855 --> 00:13:11,657
- And if they don't go along?
- I shoot them, or Mr. Hitch does.

143
00:13:11,827 --> 00:13:13,625
- That's the law.
- Your law.

144
00:13:13,797 --> 00:13:15,457
The same thing.

145
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:18,998
Hm.

146
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,466
Maybe you aren't good enough.

147
00:13:25,942 --> 00:13:28,432
Don't be so sure you're quicker than me.

148
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,942
So far I've been quick enough.

149
00:13:41,091 --> 00:13:42,581
Well...

150
00:13:43,393 --> 00:13:45,986
...perhaps now is not the time.

151
00:13:48,097 --> 00:13:50,759
Don't mean there won't be a time.

152
00:13:52,302 --> 00:13:55,168
See you and your boys there are heeled.

153
00:13:55,337 --> 00:13:58,101
I know you haven't had a chance to read the bylaws yet...

154
00:13:58,274 --> 00:14:01,402
...but the bylaws say it's illegal
to carry guns inside town limits.

155
00:14:01,577 --> 00:14:04,945
So next time I'm gonna have to disarm you,
lock you up for a bit.

156
00:14:11,153 --> 00:14:13,986
You are an interesting man, Mr. Cole.

157
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,352
Come on.

158
00:14:29,605 --> 00:14:32,700
Mr. Cole's been doing this
a long time, Mr. Olson.

159
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,902
Oh, yeah, ahem. Thank you.

160
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,173
- Good day to you.
- Good day, Mr. Olson.

161
00:15:20,255 --> 00:15:22,918
- Thank you, that'll be fine. I'll be back.
- Yes, ma'am.

162
00:16:37,834 --> 00:16:41,326
Coffee and a biscuit, please.

163
00:16:41,504 --> 00:16:43,198
No sell.

164
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,105
- But it's on the menu.
- With breakfast.

165
00:16:46,275 --> 00:16:47,674
Chin.

166
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:51,076
- Sell the lady a biscuit.
- Menu say...

167
00:16:51,246 --> 00:16:53,238
Sell her a biscuit.

168
00:16:53,716 --> 00:16:55,479
One time.

169
00:16:58,453 --> 00:17:00,979
Thank you.
- My pleasure.

170
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,250
Are you the sheriff around here?

171
00:17:05,662 --> 00:17:07,459
City marshal.

172
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,426
Virgil Cole.

173
00:17:09,832 --> 00:17:13,199
Now, this fella here's my deputy, Everett Hitch.

174
00:17:14,002 --> 00:17:16,800
- Ma'am.
- How do you do?

175
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:25,136
Thank you.

176
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:29,417
Thanks, Chin.
- You're welcome.

177
00:17:46,536 --> 00:17:52,736
Excuse me. Could either of you gentlemen
direct me to a clean, inexpensive hotel?

178
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:56,435
- We only have one.
- Is it expensive?

179
00:17:56,612 --> 00:17:59,911
Probably more than it should be,
there being no other choice.

180
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,743
I only have a dollar.

181
00:18:02,585 --> 00:18:03,950
Do you have a name?

182
00:18:04,487 --> 00:18:06,352
Mrs. French.

183
00:18:07,623 --> 00:18:09,146
Allison French.

184
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:13,184
Thank you.

185
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:19,499
Uh, you have a husband, Mrs. French?

186
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:21,326
He died.

187
00:18:22,605 --> 00:18:24,573
I'm sorry to hear that.

188
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:27,738
You do any kind of work?

189
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,241
I play the organ and the piano.

190
00:18:30,413 --> 00:18:31,641
You're not a whore?

191
00:18:34,483 --> 00:18:36,212
- What?
- Don't be crude.

192
00:18:36,385 --> 00:18:38,580
Well, no sense fluffing your feathers about it.

193
00:18:38,755 --> 00:18:41,416
We don't see a lot of single women here that ain't whores.

194
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,785
Well, I'm one.

195
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:45,153
Sprightly thing.

196
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:49,424
Do you think the hotel will let me stay for a dollar?

197
00:18:49,598 --> 00:18:52,625
You can stay as long as you like,
Mrs. French.

198
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:56,729
- Now, how can that be?
- Might even hire you to play the piano.

199
00:18:56,905 --> 00:18:59,203
- Think so, Everett?
- I do.

200
00:19:02,412 --> 00:19:03,810
Well...

201
00:19:09,184 --> 00:19:10,811
When you finish your breakfast...

202
00:19:10,987 --> 00:19:14,218
...Everett will escort you down to the hotel
and help you get settled.

203
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,721
It'll be my pleasure.

204
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:19,450
Thank you very much, Mr. Cole.

205
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,029
- For your kindness.
- No trouble at all.

206
00:19:25,134 --> 00:19:30,162
- Hope to see you again, Mrs. French.
- Yes, Mr. Cole. That would be nice.

207
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,751
You been gone a while.

208
00:19:53,328 --> 00:19:55,990
She was asking a lot about you, Virgil.

209
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,028
Well, was she asking in a liking way?

210
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:38,472
- Wanted to know if you were married.
- Well, what'd you tell her?

211
00:20:38,641 --> 00:20:40,199
Said I didn't know.

212
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:43,137
Well, hell, Everett, you see a wife around here?

213
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:44,336
I do not.

214
00:20:44,513 --> 00:20:46,846
Then why the hell did you tell her you didn't know?

215
00:20:47,016 --> 00:20:51,145
You might have a wife in Silver City.
Or in Nogales. Or Bisbee.

216
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:55,722
Bisbee? Everett, if I had a wife in Bisbee,
don't you think you'd know about her?

217
00:20:56,392 --> 00:21:01,159
Allie says she's gonna ask you about it,
so you might wanna have an answer ready.

218
00:21:02,964 --> 00:21:05,798
I had an Apache woman come live with me once...

219
00:21:05,968 --> 00:21:08,731
...but there were never any words
spoke over us or anything.

220
00:21:08,904 --> 00:21:11,395
I think she wants to know...
She's more interested...

221
00:21:11,574 --> 00:21:13,165
...in if you're presently married.

222
00:21:13,342 --> 00:21:15,333
Well, hell no, I'm not presently married.

223
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,740
She's gonna be pleased.

224
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:25,277
Allie?

225
00:21:27,256 --> 00:21:31,352
Yes, Allie. She likes to be called Allie.

226
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:40,865
So, what do you think?

227
00:21:41,604 --> 00:21:45,131
I think Mrs. French... Allie.

228
00:21:45,307 --> 00:21:47,935
- might become exclusively interesting.

229
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:50,942
I mean, what do you think about the men on the ridge?

230
00:21:53,281 --> 00:21:56,808
I think you and me might wanna
ride up there, see what they're doing.

231
00:21:58,019 --> 00:21:59,884
Can I finish my coffee first?

232
00:22:00,056 --> 00:22:02,047
You surely may.

233
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:12,098
Howdy, boys.

234
00:22:14,703 --> 00:22:17,001
Town don't come out this far, marshal.

235
00:22:17,173 --> 00:22:18,640
By God, I believe you're right.

236
00:22:18,807 --> 00:22:20,934
I believe it ends at the bottom of that hill...

237
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:22,201
...where that wash runs.

238
00:22:22,377 --> 00:22:25,278
Up here, you're just another cowboy with a gun.

239
00:22:25,448 --> 00:22:26,914
You think that's right, Everett?

240
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:30,678
I think no matter where you are,
you're not just another cowboy with a gun.

241
00:22:30,853 --> 00:22:32,012
That'd be my thought.

242
00:22:32,188 --> 00:22:36,521
Well, we ain't doing nothing wrong,
and you ain't got no "jurdiction" up here.

243
00:22:37,526 --> 00:22:38,823
"Jurdiction"?

244
00:22:39,327 --> 00:22:40,885
I believe he means jurisdiction.

245
00:22:41,063 --> 00:22:44,395
I believe he does, and he's by God right about it.

246
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:46,830
What are you doing riding round and round up here?

247
00:22:47,002 --> 00:22:49,267
We're just keeping an eye on things.

248
00:22:49,438 --> 00:22:51,065
For who?

249
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,112
Ow!

250
00:23:00,715 --> 00:23:01,875
You knocked my teeth out.

251
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:05,680
Well, Colt makes a heavy firearm.
That's a fact.

252
00:23:06,122 --> 00:23:08,214
Who are you riding for?

253
00:23:08,624 --> 00:23:10,318
Bragg.

254
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:13,686
- Think Bragg's attempting to frighten us?
- Be my guess.

255
00:23:13,863 --> 00:23:14,989
What's your name?

256
00:23:15,163 --> 00:23:16,188
- Dean.
- Well, Dean...

257
00:23:16,365 --> 00:23:19,299
...go back to Mr. Bragg
and report that we ain't too frightened.

258
00:23:19,468 --> 00:23:21,834
Mr. Bragg ain't gonna like
that you hit me.

259
00:23:22,003 --> 00:23:25,269
I don't guess you liked it all that much yourself, Dean.

260
00:23:25,441 --> 00:23:29,343
- You're damn right.
- So you and Mr. Bragg can commi...

261
00:23:30,578 --> 00:23:32,773
- What word am I trying for?
- Commiserate?

262
00:23:32,948 --> 00:23:36,474
You and Mr. Bragg
can commiserate each other.

263
00:23:37,153 --> 00:23:39,644
You son of a bitch.

264
00:23:41,156 --> 00:23:43,785
Hard to believe Jack Bell got himself killed.

265
00:23:46,796 --> 00:23:49,628
Well, what do you think happened between him and Bragg?

266
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,263
- Overconfident?
- Be my surmise.

267
00:23:54,703 --> 00:23:56,103
Mm-hm.

268
00:23:56,271 --> 00:23:59,901
Probably thought Bragg had some respect for the law.

269
00:24:00,076 --> 00:24:01,337
Mm-hm.

270
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:03,478
Ain't just gunplay.
You know that, Everett.

271
00:24:03,645 --> 00:24:06,171
You gotta think about men too.

272
00:24:07,982 --> 00:24:11,782
Guess that'd be one reason you're here
and Jack Bell isn't.

273
00:24:11,953 --> 00:24:15,515
Well, that'd be one reason.
You'd be another.

274
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,373
Mighty fine piano playing. Mighty fine.

275
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:36,534
Why, thank you.

276
00:24:38,681 --> 00:24:40,875
- Thank you. Oh, that's plenty.
- Little bit more?

277
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:42,950
It's plenty, it's plenty.

278
00:24:43,184 --> 00:24:45,016
Thank you.

279
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:56,420
- To music.
- To music.

280
00:25:03,873 --> 00:25:05,840
So tell me, Mr. Cole...

281
00:25:06,008 --> 00:25:08,202
- Call me Virgil.
- Of course, Virgil.

282
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:11,642
How long have you been killing people for a living?

283
00:25:12,181 --> 00:25:16,241
Well, Allie, I don't kill people for a living.

284
00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:18,478
I enforce the law.

285
00:25:18,653 --> 00:25:22,214
Killing's sometimes a sort of side thing of that.

286
00:25:22,391 --> 00:25:25,451
That's not what I wanted to say.
What am I aiming at here, Everett?

287
00:25:25,627 --> 00:25:28,721
- Byproduct.
- Killing's sometimes a byproduct.

288
00:25:29,131 --> 00:25:31,691
And you've never killed anyone except as a lawman?

289
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:33,493
Never.

290
00:25:33,701 --> 00:25:35,896
Is he telling me the truth, Everett?

291
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,663
Virgil always tells the truth.

292
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:40,240
Oh, nobody always tells the truth.

293
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:43,377
- Why not?
- Well, they...

294
00:25:43,778 --> 00:25:46,179
For heaven's sake, Virgil, they just don't.

295
00:25:46,347 --> 00:25:49,942
Always thought the truth was simpler.
Tell a man what you mean.

296
00:25:50,352 --> 00:25:51,979
And a woman?

297
00:25:53,288 --> 00:25:56,690
- A woman?
- That's what I said.

298
00:25:58,326 --> 00:26:03,855
Well, Allie, I don't really remember
ever telling a woman anything.

299
00:26:04,032 --> 00:26:05,364
Virgil Cole.

300
00:26:07,502 --> 00:26:08,867
What?

301
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:12,404
Are you telling me that you've never had a woman?

302
00:26:13,075 --> 00:26:16,875
Well, hell, Allie, I don't think that's
something I should be discussing with you.

303
00:26:17,046 --> 00:26:19,207
- But have you?
- Well, of course I have.

304
00:26:20,382 --> 00:26:22,406
And did you never tell them anything?

305
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:27,588
Mostly, we just did what we were there to do.

306
00:26:28,624 --> 00:26:30,785
Which was what?

307
00:26:33,828 --> 00:26:36,558
We won't talk about this anymore.

308
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:41,597
Oh, Virgil.

309
00:26:43,404 --> 00:26:46,464
- I was just funning you.
- I didn't enjoy it.

310
00:26:46,642 --> 00:26:48,905
Shit. Damn you.

311
00:26:49,077 --> 00:26:50,670
Two more, Wallis.

312
00:26:50,846 --> 00:26:53,576
You scrawny little bastard, where are you putting it all?

313
00:26:53,749 --> 00:26:54,840
Hell, you ain't even pissed.

314
00:26:55,017 --> 00:26:57,109
I can outdrink you any day of the week.

315
00:26:57,286 --> 00:27:00,413
Say when, Wallis.
- When.

316
00:27:02,991 --> 00:27:05,357
Shit. Shit.

317
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,060
- Shut up.
- What's that, marshal?

318
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,792
- Get out of here.
- We ain't doing anything.

319
00:27:21,277 --> 00:27:22,938
No, Virgil.

320
00:27:23,112 --> 00:27:26,240
Virgil! Virgil!

321
00:27:27,883 --> 00:27:29,509
Quit it!

322
00:27:32,453 --> 00:27:34,011
Virgil.

323
00:27:35,124 --> 00:27:36,147
Virgil.

324
00:27:38,826 --> 00:27:40,657
You can let go.

325
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:49,503
You can let go.

326
00:28:17,932 --> 00:28:20,992
Mr. Hitch,
may I have a word with you, please, sir?

327
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,432
Certainly.

328
00:28:22,605 --> 00:28:26,803
Mr. Hitch, it's about the teamster
that Mr. Cole, uh...

329
00:28:26,976 --> 00:28:29,342
Well, the teamster he busted up was...

330
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,377
Well, no, is a city employee, sir.

331
00:28:32,548 --> 00:28:34,846
- You might wanna take that up with Virgil.
- Uh, yeah.

332
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:38,213
Well, I thought you might be more approachable.

333
00:28:38,386 --> 00:28:40,752
You know, more amenable.

334
00:28:40,923 --> 00:28:43,653
We can't have law officers beating people half to death...

335
00:28:43,826 --> 00:28:44,986
...for no good reason.

336
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,596
I took a bottle of whiskey to Tub
this morning, told him Virgil was sorry.

337
00:28:48,763 --> 00:28:51,163
Well, perhaps he should have taken it there himself.

338
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:53,732
Virgil doesn't do things like that.

339
00:28:53,902 --> 00:28:57,497
Well, what he did, sir, was crazy.

340
00:28:57,673 --> 00:29:01,301
- You calling Virgil crazy?
- Yes. No. Uh...

341
00:29:01,477 --> 00:29:02,500
Well, if...

342
00:29:02,678 --> 00:29:05,407
You think a man makes a living as a gun hand isn't crazy?

343
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,210
- You're not crazy.
- Maybe. Maybe not.

344
00:29:09,817 --> 00:29:12,115
Whatever I am, I'm not Virgil Cole.

345
00:29:12,287 --> 00:29:14,914
It doesn't give him the right to bust up innocent people.

346
00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:16,114
No, it doesn't.

347
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,281
Mostly, innocent people don't get busted up.

348
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,586
If they do, it's because of who and what Virgil is.

349
00:29:20,762 --> 00:29:24,130
And you hired him to be Virgil Cole.

350
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,230
I'm not sure I understand.

351
00:29:28,037 --> 00:29:29,367
No.

352
00:29:30,105 --> 00:29:32,436
I'm not sure you do either.

353
00:29:33,174 --> 00:29:35,200
- Good day.
- Yes.

354
00:30:35,537 --> 00:30:37,163
Abner.

355
00:30:57,726 --> 00:30:59,990
- Morning, Abner.
- Morning.

356
00:31:01,896 --> 00:31:05,958
- Morning, Everett.
- Well, good morning, Virgil.

357
00:31:08,436 --> 00:31:11,565
- Morning, Tilda.
- Morning, Mr. Cole.

358
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:16,709
Thank you.

359
00:31:27,422 --> 00:31:30,356
- Everything good with you and Allie?
- Lovely.

360
00:31:30,526 --> 00:31:34,552
She is a lovely woman, and everything's lovely between us.

361
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,960
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

362
00:31:42,203 --> 00:31:45,366
- Good morning, Everett.
- Morning.

363
00:31:50,311 --> 00:31:52,108
Thank you.

364
00:31:55,983 --> 00:31:57,611
There you are.

365
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,912
Thank you.

366
00:32:03,558 --> 00:32:05,253
Guess what, Everett?

367
00:32:05,426 --> 00:32:06,791
What?

368
00:32:07,162 --> 00:32:10,426
You know that house that's being built
on the east end of South Street?

369
00:32:10,598 --> 00:32:11,623
Uh-huh.

370
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:14,894
Well, Mr. Olson was having it built
for his daughter and her husband.

371
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:16,934
- Right.
- But they're moving to Virginia.

372
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:20,931
- So he's gonna sell it.
- Well...

373
00:32:21,977 --> 00:32:23,410
To Virgil and me.

374
00:32:25,614 --> 00:32:27,877
It's gonna be the most beautiful house in town...

375
00:32:28,049 --> 00:32:30,609
...with a parlor and a white picket fence.

376
00:32:30,786 --> 00:32:34,278
And a big porch so we can see who's coming to call.

377
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:38,357
Well...

378
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,362
How about that?

379
00:32:56,044 --> 00:32:57,534
I ain't... I ain't armed.

380
00:32:59,314 --> 00:33:01,009
My name is Whitfield.

381
00:33:01,182 --> 00:33:03,980
I'm Joe Whitfield and I'm a hand over at Bragg's place.

382
00:33:08,957 --> 00:33:11,925
Allie, I'm gonna need to talk to this fella
alone for a minute.

383
00:33:12,094 --> 00:33:13,527
Oh.

384
00:33:13,862 --> 00:33:15,727
Well, certainly.

385
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:19,923
Have to do my piano exercises anyway.

386
00:33:25,707 --> 00:33:27,799
I was up on the rim when you and your deputy...

387
00:33:27,976 --> 00:33:30,536
You came up and smacked Dean.

388
00:33:34,249 --> 00:33:36,240
I took on because...

389
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:39,614
I took on because Bragg was supposed to be running cattle.

390
00:33:39,788 --> 00:33:42,415
- And that's what I know.
- What are you driving at, son?

391
00:33:43,592 --> 00:33:46,652
I was at Bragg's place when Marshal Bell
and his deputies was killed.

392
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:50,660
Who done it?

393
00:33:52,034 --> 00:33:53,694
Bragg done it.

394
00:33:56,872 --> 00:33:59,500
You saw Randall Bragg shoot Jack Bell?

395
00:33:59,674 --> 00:34:01,733
Yes, sir. And his two deputies.

396
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:04,241
He shot them all dead like they was rattlesnakes.

397
00:34:04,413 --> 00:34:06,142
Sit down there.

398
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:08,847
Sit down.

399
00:34:13,155 --> 00:34:15,918
I don't want no part in killing people.

400
00:34:16,891 --> 00:34:19,326
You testify to what you saw?

401
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:22,027
Yes. Yes, sir.

402
00:34:22,197 --> 00:34:24,688
- With Bragg looking right at you?
- I will.

403
00:34:25,967 --> 00:34:29,164
Because we don't wanna go up there,
shoot up a bunch of people...

404
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:32,135
...and get Bragg into court
to have you dry up and blow away.

405
00:34:32,306 --> 00:34:34,365
I'll say what I saw.

406
00:34:35,376 --> 00:34:37,367
Give me your word on that?

407
00:34:39,347 --> 00:34:40,838
I do.

408
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,675
You're under arrest for the murder of Jack Bell.

409
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:22,713
Don't make a sound.

410
00:36:25,286 --> 00:36:29,121
- You can't do this, Cole.
- Yeah, well, I'm doing it.

411
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:30,690
Let's go.

412
00:36:44,005 --> 00:36:46,405
Get on your horses. They've got Bragg.

413
00:37:00,222 --> 00:37:02,588
Keep that gun on him, Everett.

414
00:37:04,226 --> 00:37:05,556
Come on over there.

415
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,538
You try anything, you're a dead man.

416
00:37:27,882 --> 00:37:29,907
What you like us to do, Mr. Bragg?

417
00:37:30,085 --> 00:37:32,076
Tell them to lower their guns.

418
00:37:33,288 --> 00:37:35,222
Hold off, Vince.

419
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:37,423
Lower your guns.

420
00:37:39,327 --> 00:37:41,260
Lower your guns.

421
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:17,594
Tell them not to follow or I'll blow your jaw off.

422
00:38:17,766 --> 00:38:19,858
- Vince.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Bragg?

423
00:38:20,034 --> 00:38:22,503
Don't let them follow,
you understand? Stay put.

424
00:38:23,304 --> 00:38:25,135
If you say so, Mr. Bragg.

425
00:38:40,822 --> 00:38:43,382
- Out of the way.
- Stop it.

426
00:38:48,496 --> 00:38:51,556
- It's Mr. Bragg.
- Yes, it is.

427
00:38:53,534 --> 00:38:55,001
They have him well in hand.

428
00:38:56,871 --> 00:38:59,431
Circuit judge don't come through for two and a half weeks.

429
00:38:59,608 --> 00:39:03,009
You're wasting your time, Cole.
You've got no proof.

430
00:39:15,923 --> 00:39:17,516
You're a dead man.

431
00:39:18,827 --> 00:39:20,987
That's not very neighborly.

432
00:39:21,161 --> 00:39:22,891
You're dead.

433
00:39:29,271 --> 00:39:31,329
You'll never hang me, Cole.

434
00:39:31,773 --> 00:39:34,742
Never's a long time, Mr. Bragg.

435
00:39:43,018 --> 00:39:45,144
I'm gonna go check on Allie.

436
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,278
First sign of any trouble,
fire off a couple rounds, I'll be here.

437
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:51,525
Unless you're riding at a hard gallop.

438
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:58,157
Everett, we've known each other a long time.

439
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:01,563
I don't care for that kind of dis... Dis...

440
00:40:03,038 --> 00:40:05,699
- Disparaging?
- Disparaging remarks.

441
00:40:05,873 --> 00:40:07,204
Especially about Allie.

442
00:40:12,713 --> 00:40:14,806
No, and you shouldn't.

443
00:40:15,416 --> 00:40:17,009
I apologize.

444
00:40:17,184 --> 00:40:19,119
You meant no harm.

445
00:40:19,688 --> 00:40:21,655
Apology accepted.

446
00:40:37,505 --> 00:40:39,905
I know you're scared, son.

447
00:40:41,342 --> 00:40:45,574
You keep your word and testify,
I promise we'll get you out of here safely.

448
00:40:50,418 --> 00:40:52,079
Thank you, sir.

449
00:40:52,487 --> 00:40:54,114
You're welcome.

450
00:41:43,338 --> 00:41:46,465
Allie's chewing on me like a young dog.

451
00:41:46,673 --> 00:41:51,407
Says all I do is be a marshal,
sit around minding our prisoner.

452
00:41:51,579 --> 00:41:53,547
That I care more about marshaling than her.

453
00:41:53,715 --> 00:41:56,945
That I ain't even brung you down to see the house yet.

454
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:00,715
I was figuring to see it when it's all finished.

455
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:02,914
Well, go on down there, will you?

456
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:04,853
Calm her down a little.

457
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:07,755
You know, tell her you like it.

458
00:42:09,563 --> 00:42:10,588
What do you got there?

459
00:42:10,764 --> 00:42:14,666
She asked me which one I liked for the curtain.

460
00:42:14,835 --> 00:42:15,860
Mm-hm.

461
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:19,563
Everett, I ain't... I never owned a house.
I didn't know what to say to her.

462
00:42:20,141 --> 00:42:23,735
If the wind picks up, house'll blow down
and you won't have to worry about it.

463
00:42:23,911 --> 00:42:27,369
That house ain't going nowhere.
I got a carpenter that used to build boats.

464
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:31,076
Will you go on down there, please?
Go on.

465
00:42:31,251 --> 00:42:33,742
Just... You know,
she's planning the furniture.

466
00:42:33,922 --> 00:42:35,286
All right.

467
00:42:35,456 --> 00:42:37,014
Here, take these with you.

468
00:42:37,192 --> 00:42:40,251
Tell her she can pick whichever one she likes.

469
00:42:41,695 --> 00:42:44,425
You know, I'm kind of partial to this one here, but look.

470
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:47,396
Look at that.
You can see right through it.

471
00:42:50,905 --> 00:42:53,567
Kind of small for curtains, aren't they?

472
00:42:54,342 --> 00:42:56,400
Get on down there.

473
00:43:16,998 --> 00:43:18,829
Everett.

474
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,268
Afternoon, Allie.

475
00:43:22,135 --> 00:43:24,103
I must look awful.

476
00:43:24,271 --> 00:43:28,469
- You look lovely. Always do.
- You're too kind, Everett.

477
00:43:29,943 --> 00:43:32,844
Virgil said you should pick out the curtains.

478
00:43:33,914 --> 00:43:36,246
Couldn't make up his mind.

479
00:43:38,485 --> 00:43:40,010
House is hurrying right along.

480
00:43:40,188 --> 00:43:43,248
Virgil ever decides to come and live in it.

481
00:43:43,724 --> 00:43:45,454
Pretty sure he will.

482
00:43:45,626 --> 00:43:47,822
Doesn't pay any attention to the house.

483
00:43:47,996 --> 00:43:51,329
Hell, Everett, he doesn't pay any attention to me.

484
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:56,559
Just sits up in his jail with his gun...

485
00:43:56,737 --> 00:43:58,568
...being the marshal.

486
00:43:59,273 --> 00:44:03,643
Well, has been somewhat expectant of late.

487
00:44:04,211 --> 00:44:06,577
Yeah, but it's his job.

488
00:44:06,748 --> 00:44:08,773
It's not his life.

489
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:16,211
- Yeah.
- It'll be so elegant.

490
00:44:16,423 --> 00:44:18,085
Come see.

491
00:44:18,793 --> 00:44:19,918
This is the parlor...

492
00:44:20,094 --> 00:44:24,326
...so we can look out
and see everybody who's coming to call.

493
00:44:26,534 --> 00:44:29,059
Come and see this. Come and see.

494
00:44:29,304 --> 00:44:33,400
That will be the bedroom, and this will be the kitchen.

495
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:36,335
And you'll come often to visit us?

496
00:44:36,744 --> 00:44:38,177
Every time I'm invited.

497
00:44:38,346 --> 00:44:40,711
I can cook, you know.

498
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:44,009
I never imagined you couldn't.

499
00:44:53,327 --> 00:44:55,523
Do you think I'm pretty?

500
00:44:56,496 --> 00:44:58,521
Well, yes.

501
00:45:14,114 --> 00:45:17,242
Allie, you're with Virgil.

502
00:45:17,485 --> 00:45:18,610
So am I.

503
00:45:20,288 --> 00:45:22,518
Virgil's not here.

504
00:45:26,094 --> 00:45:28,425
We're not with each other.

505
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:31,963
We're both with him.

506
00:45:34,434 --> 00:45:36,300
Let go of me.

507
00:45:37,204 --> 00:45:40,572
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Let go.

508
00:45:40,742 --> 00:45:43,039
- Allie.
- Let go.

509
00:45:52,653 --> 00:45:54,554
Just leave.

510
00:46:34,429 --> 00:46:36,420
- We come for Mr. Bragg.
- You can't have him.

511
00:46:36,597 --> 00:46:39,588
Everett, step on in the office
with that eight-gauge.

512
00:46:39,766 --> 00:46:42,429
First anything happens,
you blow Mr. Bragg's head off.

513
00:46:42,603 --> 00:46:44,969
- Yes, sir.
- We'll take him if we have to.

514
00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:46,469
If you do, he'll be dead.

515
00:46:49,443 --> 00:46:52,413
We know you're good, Cole,
but you're not as good as 20 of us.

516
00:46:52,579 --> 00:46:54,103
You know the arrangement, boy.

517
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:56,472
First one of you does an ineluctable thing...

518
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,777
You shoot him, you think we're gonna ride away?

519
00:46:58,952 --> 00:47:00,045
Nope.

520
00:47:01,155 --> 00:47:03,487
- We'll kill you and Hitch.
- You'll try.

521
00:47:03,657 --> 00:47:05,922
You're willing to die to keep us from taking him?

522
00:47:06,094 --> 00:47:07,652
Sure.

523
00:47:08,896 --> 00:47:10,887
Hitch. You willing to die too?

524
00:47:11,065 --> 00:47:15,626
Of course he's willing to die. You think
we do this because we're scared to die?

525
00:47:16,336 --> 00:47:17,894
You got them turned.

526
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:20,034
They're arguing with him.

527
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,907
You?

528
00:47:22,175 --> 00:47:23,199
Me?

529
00:47:23,844 --> 00:47:25,369
You afraid to die?

530
00:47:25,813 --> 00:47:29,213
- I ain't afraid.
- Good, because you go first.

531
00:47:29,817 --> 00:47:32,751
And that boy with the red scarf goes next.

532
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:39,052
You go on home, Vince.

533
00:47:40,094 --> 00:47:42,085
You go on home.

534
00:47:42,829 --> 00:47:45,025
Go on. Too many people die if you don't.

535
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:48,034
Go on. Get on.

536
00:47:48,202 --> 00:47:51,000
Go. Get. All of you, get out of here.

537
00:47:51,172 --> 00:47:54,072
- There'll be another time, Cole.
- Get out of here, get. Hyah!

538
00:47:54,474 --> 00:47:55,806
Hyah!

539
00:47:57,577 --> 00:47:59,306
Virgil?

540
00:48:02,516 --> 00:48:05,610
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right, Allie.

541
00:48:06,454 --> 00:48:08,353
Let's get you inside.

542
00:48:14,594 --> 00:48:16,391
What did you do?

543
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:21,425
- What do you care?
- What did you do?

544
00:48:27,974 --> 00:48:29,442
I ran off.

545
00:48:33,414 --> 00:48:36,440
- You say anything to Mr. Cole?
- No.

546
00:48:36,617 --> 00:48:39,177
- You gonna say anything?
- No.

547
00:48:40,554 --> 00:48:42,920
Virgil couldn't hear a thing like that.

548
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,429
I don't want him hearing about it from you either.

549
00:48:49,597 --> 00:48:52,429
He finds out, I'll know
who couldn't keep her mouth closed.

550
00:48:53,967 --> 00:48:58,302
There have been a few times
when you didn't want my mouth closed.

551
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:10,938
What if she tells him and says it was your doing?

552
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,746
Why would she do that?

553
00:49:15,356 --> 00:49:17,516
Sooner or later she's gonna tell him.

554
00:49:30,338 --> 00:49:34,239
Good morning, Tilda.
- Morning, Mr. Hitch.

555
00:49:41,181 --> 00:49:43,742
Couldn't help but notice your books, marshal.

556
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,380
What's the fascination with Emerson?

557
00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:53,226
Not the most elegant writer, but he gets his point across.

558
00:49:55,396 --> 00:49:58,956
Though I'm sure the layman
is sometimes a little befuddled...

559
00:49:59,132 --> 00:50:03,661
...by his obfuscating vocabulary,
wouldn't you say?

560
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:05,601
We've been treating you kindly, Bragg.

561
00:50:05,773 --> 00:50:08,105
In return, we expect you to speak when spoken to...

562
00:50:08,275 --> 00:50:10,335
...and otherwise keep your mouth shut.

563
00:50:10,911 --> 00:50:12,344
I can speak if I want to.

564
00:50:12,512 --> 00:50:15,072
Virgil and I can beat the sweet Jesus hell out of you...

565
00:50:15,248 --> 00:50:18,115
...every morning for breakfast
if we want to.

566
00:50:28,862 --> 00:50:33,231
Clyde Stringer, county sheriff.
My undersheriff, Charlie Tewksbury.

567
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,130
- Virgil Cole?
- Right there.

568
00:50:35,302 --> 00:50:37,498
Been expecting you, sheriff.

569
00:50:38,105 --> 00:50:39,538
Clyde.

570
00:50:40,141 --> 00:50:41,164
- Charlie.
- Morning.

571
00:50:41,342 --> 00:50:43,242
This fella's my deputy, Everett Hitch.

572
00:50:43,411 --> 00:50:47,278
We just came in on a train from Yaqui
with Judge Elias Callison.

573
00:50:47,614 --> 00:50:52,382
This fella here's our witness.
Former hand of Bragg, Joe Whitfield.

574
00:50:52,686 --> 00:50:55,018
- You're gonna testify?
- Yes, sir.

575
00:50:55,188 --> 00:50:58,885
- If he doesn't die of fright first.
- We been keeping him seque...

576
00:51:00,061 --> 00:51:01,085
Seq...

577
00:51:03,364 --> 00:51:05,628
S... Seq...

578
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,525
What's the word I'm looking for?

579
00:51:08,702 --> 00:51:12,639
- Sequestered.
- Sequestered here for safety.

580
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:17,606
Charlie and I'd be happy to help
till the trial's over if you need it.

581
00:51:17,777 --> 00:51:20,076
Might just take you boys up on that.

582
00:51:21,882 --> 00:51:23,974
- Good morning.
- Good morning, gentlemen.

583
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:25,550
Going for a little buggy ride?

584
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:29,746
Yeah, me and Mrs. French
are gonna do a little perambulating.

585
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:33,423
Mr. Raines, Mr. May.

586
00:51:33,594 --> 00:51:35,494
Morning, Everett.

587
00:51:35,663 --> 00:51:37,460
Got your goodies.

588
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:42,235
- Sure you can handle this rig?
- Well...

589
00:51:46,007 --> 00:51:47,565
You know them?

590
00:51:48,342 --> 00:51:50,400
The Shelton brothers.

591
00:51:50,577 --> 00:51:53,068
They do law work?
- They do gun work.

592
00:51:53,614 --> 00:51:56,242
- They good?
- They're excellent.

593
00:51:56,717 --> 00:51:58,344
Good as you and me?

594
00:51:58,518 --> 00:52:00,646
Don't know that they ain't.

595
00:52:01,822 --> 00:52:03,516
Don't appear to be heeled.

596
00:52:07,661 --> 00:52:09,288
Well...

597
00:52:11,431 --> 00:52:13,262
It's been a long time, Virgil.

598
00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:17,938
- Ring.
- You remember my brother?

599
00:52:18,105 --> 00:52:19,902
Mackie.
- Virgil.

600
00:52:20,074 --> 00:52:21,541
Can I buy you a drink?

601
00:52:23,677 --> 00:52:25,610
Are you still doing that?

602
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:27,637
Well, we ain't.

603
00:52:31,385 --> 00:52:33,114
This is my deputy, Everett Hitch.

604
00:52:33,286 --> 00:52:35,255
You as good as Virgil with a gun?

605
00:52:35,422 --> 00:52:37,686
I never seen anybody as good as Virgil.

606
00:52:38,259 --> 00:52:41,956
- But you ain't saying you ain't as good.
- Not discussing it, truth be told.

607
00:52:42,128 --> 00:52:43,925
What are you and Mackie doing in town?

608
00:52:44,097 --> 00:52:46,896
Everybody's gotta be somewhere, don't they, Mackie?

609
00:52:47,068 --> 00:52:51,164
You got a trial coming up, a big one.
Might wanna take that in.

610
00:52:52,139 --> 00:52:53,663
I like a good trial.

611
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,603
Good morning.

612
00:52:58,913 --> 00:53:00,072
This is Mrs. French.

613
00:53:01,548 --> 00:53:03,016
Ma'am.

614
00:53:03,951 --> 00:53:05,179
Gentlemen.

615
00:53:08,688 --> 00:53:10,315
Thank you.

616
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,224
Well, you boys been in my towns before.

617
00:53:17,297 --> 00:53:19,391
You know the rules.

618
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:21,867
Come on.

619
00:53:22,836 --> 00:53:25,032
Haven't done this for a while.

620
00:53:27,273 --> 00:53:30,766
I always figured Virgil for whores and squaws.

621
00:53:32,847 --> 00:53:33,905
She's neither.

622
00:53:34,748 --> 00:53:36,545
I'll be damned.

623
00:53:43,891 --> 00:53:45,255
We can try if you wanna.

624
00:53:45,659 --> 00:53:47,684
What happened next?

625
00:53:59,139 --> 00:54:01,768
Mr. Bragg shot the deputy dead
with his Winchester.

626
00:54:01,942 --> 00:54:03,534
You're a goddamn liar!

627
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:11,213
One more outburst
such as that, Mr. Bragg...

628
00:54:11,385 --> 00:54:14,945
...and I will give Sheriff Stringer
the authority to shut you up...

629
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:16,885
...in any manner he sees fit.

630
00:54:17,056 --> 00:54:20,891
With all due respect, Your Honor,
my client's life is on the line.

631
00:54:21,061 --> 00:54:23,655
His life is not on the line yet, counselor.

632
00:54:25,331 --> 00:54:28,789
He'll have his chance to speak. Sit down.

633
00:54:29,302 --> 00:54:31,293
Go ahead, son.

634
00:54:33,574 --> 00:54:38,170
Then Mr. Bragg shot Marshal Bell
and his other deputy.

635
00:54:39,847 --> 00:54:43,043
You saw this happen with your own eyes, son?

636
00:54:43,217 --> 00:54:44,775
Yes, sir.

637
00:54:46,686 --> 00:54:48,586
Thank you, Mr. Whitfield.

638
00:54:48,755 --> 00:54:51,155
Mr. Mueller,
you may cross-examine the witness.

639
00:54:57,431 --> 00:55:00,992
<i>You swear to tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</i>

640
00:55:01,168 --> 00:55:02,192
<i>I do.</i>

641
00:55:07,074 --> 00:55:10,474
Well, Mr. Sullivan,
what have you got to say for yourself?

642
00:55:11,045 --> 00:55:14,947
Jack Bell and his deputies
never came up to Mr. Bragg's ranch.

643
00:55:15,114 --> 00:55:17,106
I don't know what Whitfield's talking about.

644
00:55:17,284 --> 00:55:19,275
That's the same thing all of you have said.

645
00:55:20,954 --> 00:55:24,048
Does anybody have anything different to say other than:

646
00:55:24,224 --> 00:55:27,751
"Jack Bell and his deputies
never came up to Mr. Bragg's ranch...

647
00:55:27,927 --> 00:55:30,327
...and I don't know
what Whitfield's talking about"?

648
00:55:33,867 --> 00:55:35,925
You may step down.

649
00:55:37,137 --> 00:55:41,335
Well, no reason to waste time
saying the same thing over and over again.

650
00:55:41,507 --> 00:55:43,907
My client has a right to testify in his own defense.

651
00:55:44,077 --> 00:55:46,637
Of course he does. One moment.

652
00:55:46,813 --> 00:55:48,144
Mr. Whitfield...

653
00:55:49,617 --> 00:55:50,777
...do you own a horse?

654
00:55:50,951 --> 00:55:52,179
Yes. Yes, sir.

655
00:55:52,353 --> 00:55:54,947
Well, son, I suggest while the bees are in the butter...

656
00:55:55,121 --> 00:55:57,885
...you get on your horse and ride.

657
00:55:58,057 --> 00:56:00,150
Ride and don't look back.

658
00:56:01,494 --> 00:56:05,021
- Now.
- Ride hard, boy. Ride hard.

659
00:56:12,572 --> 00:56:13,972
Swear him in, Mr. Wallis.

660
00:56:17,777 --> 00:56:19,768
Put your hand on the Bible.

661
00:56:20,179 --> 00:56:22,670
- Do you swear to tell the whole truth...
- I swear.

662
00:56:22,849 --> 00:56:24,681
- so help you God?

663
00:56:27,054 --> 00:56:30,545
Your Honor, I sense a certain antipathy toward...

664
00:56:30,724 --> 00:56:32,918
Sit down, Mr. Bragg.

665
00:56:34,094 --> 00:56:36,425
I sense a certain antipathy toward me here today...

666
00:56:36,597 --> 00:56:39,190
...because I'm a relative newcomer.

667
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:44,498
Now, I didn't kill Jack Bell or his deputies.
Jack was a friend of mine.

668
00:56:44,672 --> 00:56:46,036
I had no reason to kill him.

669
00:56:47,206 --> 00:56:51,576
Mr. Whitfield is nothing more
than a fearful boy...

670
00:56:51,744 --> 00:56:55,202
...easily persuaded to say anything.

671
00:56:55,382 --> 00:56:58,317
Easily persuaded by Marshal Cole.

672
00:56:58,818 --> 00:57:00,753
Now, the citizens of Appaloosa...

673
00:57:01,288 --> 00:57:05,246
...have allowed Mr. Cole
to take over their town.

674
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:10,463
But it is not justice in this new nation of ours...

675
00:57:10,664 --> 00:57:14,599
...to allow him to deprive me
of my liberty...

676
00:57:14,967 --> 00:57:18,563
...let alone my life.

677
00:57:21,307 --> 00:57:23,798
Eloquent, Mr. Bragg.

678
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:27,309
But unconvincing.

679
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:29,748
I find you guilty of these charges...

680
00:57:31,452 --> 00:57:33,920
...and sentence you to hang
at Yaqui Prison.

681
00:57:36,789 --> 00:57:37,916
Court's adjourned.

682
00:57:58,945 --> 00:58:00,469
Everett?

683
00:58:02,516 --> 00:58:06,213
"What I must do is all that concerns me...

684
00:58:06,387 --> 00:58:08,855
...not what the people think.

685
00:58:10,123 --> 00:58:16,791
This rule, equally arduous
in actual and in intellectual life..."

686
00:58:18,798 --> 00:58:20,425
Arduous.

687
00:58:36,282 --> 00:58:39,309
We'll bring out sourdough and ham when we get to Chester.

688
00:58:39,485 --> 00:58:41,077
How long till Chester?

689
00:58:42,889 --> 00:58:44,880
Three quarters of an hour.

690
00:58:46,293 --> 00:58:50,251
When we reach the upgrade,
you'll feel the train slow down.

691
00:58:50,431 --> 00:58:53,365
Ain't a hell of a grade, but it's a long one.

692
00:59:04,445 --> 00:59:07,505
- We're just gonna take a look outside.
- I got him.

693
01:00:07,173 --> 01:00:09,335
So you see how this is gonna go.

694
01:00:11,445 --> 01:00:14,505
Any sign of trouble from anyone
and Mackie gives her both barrels.

695
01:00:14,914 --> 01:00:18,942
Or she breaks her neck
and is dragged through the mesquite.

696
01:00:19,452 --> 01:00:21,717
So you folks are gonna have to unshackle Bragg...

697
01:00:21,889 --> 01:00:25,255
...and parade him on out here
or she gets killed.

698
01:00:25,425 --> 01:00:27,416
I got you in my sights.

699
01:00:27,594 --> 01:00:30,460
Whatever happens to her, you're dead.

700
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:41,231
What do you think, Virgil? You think
I'm gonna get scared and change my mind?

701
01:01:02,896 --> 01:01:04,362
Put your rifle down.

702
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:05,963
Sorry, Cole, this ain't your jurisdiction.

703
01:01:06,132 --> 01:01:07,760
Put it down!

704
01:01:07,934 --> 01:01:09,027
You too, Everett.

705
01:01:16,242 --> 01:01:17,733
Charlie.

706
01:01:22,282 --> 01:01:25,614
We give you Bragg, you give us the woman.

707
01:01:25,786 --> 01:01:28,050
Virgil, you know I ain't that dumb.

708
01:01:28,221 --> 01:01:31,280
You give us Bragg, we keep the woman.
You ride off on that train...

709
01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:34,893
...and when you're out of sight,
we'll cut her loose.

710
01:01:43,737 --> 01:01:45,226
Give them Bragg.

711
01:01:45,639 --> 01:01:47,539
Charlie, go get him.

712
01:02:07,661 --> 01:02:09,856
- Give me a gun!
- No.

713
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:13,123
- I'm gonna shoot that son of a bitch.
- That ain't part of the deal.

714
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:15,393
Damn it, Ring, I hired you. Give me a gun.

715
01:02:15,568 --> 01:02:16,967
You owe me money.

716
01:02:17,137 --> 01:02:19,400
Until you pay me, you ain't getting no gun.

717
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:25,373
Move on up the track.

718
01:02:25,911 --> 01:02:28,039
I told you you'd never hang me, Cole.

719
01:02:28,215 --> 01:02:29,704
Never ain't here yet.

720
01:03:36,717 --> 01:03:38,775
Leave him be, sheriff.

721
01:03:40,454 --> 01:03:44,117
But we got no horses.
We can't chase him on foot.

722
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:48,356
We'll go on back to Appaloosa and get some.

723
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:52,987
The quicker Cole gets back here,
the quicker we can get out of here.

724
01:03:53,233 --> 01:03:55,030
He won't come back.

725
01:03:56,202 --> 01:03:57,931
Won't come back?

726
01:03:58,605 --> 01:04:01,438
Nope. He won't come back.

727
01:04:14,755 --> 01:04:17,315
We've got no horses, Virgil.

728
01:04:19,492 --> 01:04:22,360
I'll ride the train back to town and fetch them.

729
01:04:22,528 --> 01:04:25,498
You stray off the wash, leave me a sign.

730
01:05:16,682 --> 01:05:19,048
Well, by God.

731
01:05:20,253 --> 01:05:22,983
- Virgil.
- Everett.

732
01:05:24,324 --> 01:05:25,916
You bring any coffee?

733
01:05:26,592 --> 01:05:28,253
Done so.

734
01:06:15,842 --> 01:06:17,536
You all right?

735
01:06:19,246 --> 01:06:21,077
All right?

736
01:06:21,648 --> 01:06:23,411
Well, how do you feel?

737
01:06:23,583 --> 01:06:25,574
About Allie and all.

738
01:06:28,121 --> 01:06:29,610
Everett...

739
01:06:30,856 --> 01:06:33,324
...we've been together now a while.

740
01:06:33,492 --> 01:06:36,724
Can't exactly say how long, but long.

741
01:06:36,963 --> 01:06:40,090
Ain't anybody I'd rather do this work with.

742
01:06:40,432 --> 01:06:45,836
You're as good as anybody I've seen,
except maybe the Shelton boys and me.

743
01:06:46,572 --> 01:06:51,670
The reason you ain't as good as the Sheltons or me...

744
01:06:51,844 --> 01:06:56,077
...ain't got nothing to do
with steady or fast or fortuitous.

745
01:06:56,349 --> 01:07:01,012
The reason the above-named folks are
better than you is because you got feelings.

746
01:07:01,755 --> 01:07:04,349
Well, hell, Virgil, everybody's got feelings.

747
01:07:04,523 --> 01:07:06,788
Feelings get you killed.

748
01:07:08,193 --> 01:07:11,219
You got feelings about Allie, don't you?

749
01:07:11,931 --> 01:07:16,494
I cared about Allie in town,
and I'll care about her when I get her back.

750
01:07:19,905 --> 01:07:24,934
But right now there's something running,
and we're trying to catch it.

751
01:07:46,766 --> 01:07:48,494
There they are.

752
01:07:49,068 --> 01:07:50,764
Yeah, I see them.

753
01:07:55,641 --> 01:07:57,199
Yup, that's Allie.

754
01:07:57,376 --> 01:08:00,072
Hey, Virg, look north.

755
01:08:00,347 --> 01:08:01,643
Up on the flats.

756
01:08:07,753 --> 01:08:08,880
Chiricahua, I reckon.

757
01:08:09,054 --> 01:08:13,389
Probably broke out of San Carlos, headed down to Mexico.

758
01:08:15,461 --> 01:08:18,521
Looks like they stole horses.
A lot of them ain't Indians' ponies.

759
01:08:18,698 --> 01:08:20,859
Pretty raggedy-looking bunch.

760
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,466
They will be a problem.

761
01:08:23,837 --> 01:08:26,067
I speculate they will.

762
01:09:02,141 --> 01:09:04,234
You see Allie anywhere?

763
01:09:11,051 --> 01:09:12,381
Yes, I do.
- Whoo!

764
01:09:14,921 --> 01:09:16,512
What is it?

765
01:09:19,259 --> 01:09:20,920
Give me that thing.

766
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:51,413
There's Bragg.

767
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:58,887
Are you sure about that?

768
01:10:06,305 --> 01:10:07,466
I think about 10 of them.

769
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:10,541
We start shooting, they'll scatter.
Won't know how many we are.

770
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:12,439
Won't go far.

771
01:10:12,912 --> 01:10:15,710
A lot of stuff they want down there.

772
01:10:41,006 --> 01:10:44,271
No. Oh, no, no. No, stop!

773
01:10:44,844 --> 01:10:47,641
Hey.
- No! No!

774
01:10:48,247 --> 01:10:49,943
Ring!

775
01:10:50,216 --> 01:10:52,479
- No!
- Shoot the packhorse.

776
01:11:06,832 --> 01:11:08,425
Hey, whoa.

777
01:11:09,569 --> 01:11:12,060
- Get away from there.
- Get out of there.

778
01:11:14,974 --> 01:11:16,873
Where do you think you're going?

779
01:11:17,243 --> 01:11:19,073
- Back behind the tree.
- Virgil.

780
01:11:19,244 --> 01:11:21,372
You too, Allie.

781
01:11:21,847 --> 01:11:25,215
Everett, get the bags off that packhorse.

782
01:11:32,192 --> 01:11:33,658
I knew you'd be coming after us.

783
01:11:34,527 --> 01:11:36,494
Oh, you did, huh?

784
01:11:38,765 --> 01:11:40,356
Where you headed?

785
01:11:40,533 --> 01:11:43,399
Little town, Rio Seco, two days' ride.

786
01:11:43,603 --> 01:11:45,365
While we got these hostiles to deal with...

787
01:11:45,537 --> 01:11:47,506
...ain't a good idea
us shooting each other.

788
01:11:48,073 --> 01:11:51,407
I say we put our troubles aside till we get there.

789
01:11:51,644 --> 01:11:52,667
Your word?

790
01:11:53,645 --> 01:11:55,408
My word.

791
01:11:55,648 --> 01:11:57,046
Mackie?

792
01:11:57,216 --> 01:11:59,150
My word, Cole.

793
01:11:59,719 --> 01:12:01,686
Give them their guns, Everett.

794
01:12:05,425 --> 01:12:09,520
Mackie, you got some clothes in there, cover Allie up?

795
01:12:13,032 --> 01:12:14,555
Thank you.

796
01:12:17,436 --> 01:12:19,904
They've seen pretty much everything you got, Allie.

797
01:12:20,073 --> 01:12:22,337
No sense hiding it now.

798
01:12:25,345 --> 01:12:27,279
We'll dig in here. Keep watch.

799
01:12:27,447 --> 01:12:30,074
Mackie, get up on that hillside there somewhere.

800
01:12:30,483 --> 01:12:35,113
Everett, soon as Ring gets his boots on,
have a look either end of this canyon.

801
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:40,518
Good to see you again, Mr. Bragg.

802
01:14:13,286 --> 01:14:16,186
Virgil, how do we know they're still there?

803
01:14:18,157 --> 01:14:19,953
Oh, they're still there, Allie.

804
01:14:26,765 --> 01:14:29,394
What the hell these son of bitches doing?

805
01:14:32,471 --> 01:14:34,667
What the hell do you think they're gonna do?

806
01:14:34,841 --> 01:14:36,809
I'll tell you what they're gonna do.

807
01:14:36,975 --> 01:14:39,409
- They're gonna wait until our food's gone.
- Shut up.

808
01:14:39,578 --> 01:14:42,104
They're gonna wait until we're beat down with the heat.

809
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:45,011
About the time they smell the blood
of stock that you've killed...

810
01:14:45,184 --> 01:14:47,708
...because you're starving to death...
- I said shut up.

811
01:14:47,886 --> 01:14:49,649
I'm gonna ride up and see.

812
01:14:49,855 --> 01:14:51,015
Hey.

813
01:14:51,189 --> 01:14:54,023
Where the hell do you think you're going with my horse?

814
01:18:15,461 --> 01:18:19,363
- Bragg owes me money.
- He's my prisoner.

815
01:18:20,733 --> 01:18:23,030
He stays my prisoner.

816
01:18:23,769 --> 01:18:26,363
You're taking this personal, Virgil.

817
01:18:29,675 --> 01:18:34,043
When we get to Rio Seco,
we'll take care of the business between us.

818
01:18:36,948 --> 01:18:39,439
Everett, let's go spell Mackie.

819
01:18:43,555 --> 01:18:45,113
Come on.

820
01:18:54,867 --> 01:18:56,425
Virgil?

821
01:18:57,269 --> 01:18:59,100
Yes, Allie?

822
01:19:00,939 --> 01:19:03,601
Can I come up and sit with you and Everett?

823
01:19:04,176 --> 01:19:05,336
Come on.

824
01:19:29,868 --> 01:19:32,167
I'm sorry, Virgil.

825
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:36,704
Stay here, Everett.

826
01:19:40,445 --> 01:19:42,310
I'm sorry.

827
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:46,578
I was so alone, and Bragg...

828
01:19:47,453 --> 01:19:50,444
Well, Ring protected me and so did his brother.

829
01:19:50,622 --> 01:19:53,614
- You fuck Mackie too?
- No.

830
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:58,025
It was Ring. He was in charge.

831
01:20:03,469 --> 01:20:06,438
I just did what I had to do.

832
01:20:07,073 --> 01:20:08,631
Everett...

833
01:20:09,108 --> 01:20:13,408
...Ring kills me,
do you think she'll go off with him?

834
01:20:23,488 --> 01:20:27,983
I think Allie needs to be with a man.

835
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:30,525
You're a bastard.

836
01:20:31,730 --> 01:20:32,755
Don't listen to him.

837
01:20:32,931 --> 01:20:36,560
He tried to put his hands on me
when I showed him our house.

838
01:20:37,136 --> 01:20:40,662
No, Virgil. I did not.

839
01:20:41,407 --> 01:20:46,070
No, Allie. Everett didn't do that.

840
01:20:48,646 --> 01:20:52,207
- You believe him over me?
- That's correct.

841
01:20:53,985 --> 01:20:55,646
Yeah.

842
01:21:38,831 --> 01:21:41,925
I'm Virgil Cole, marshal of Appaloosa.

843
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:44,194
This is my deputy, Everett Hitch.

844
01:21:45,904 --> 01:21:49,033
These are the Shelton boys.
This man here is my prisoner.

845
01:21:49,207 --> 01:21:52,802
He's been sentenced to hang in Yaqui
for the murder of a city marshal.

846
01:21:53,378 --> 01:21:58,578
I need him, uh, sequestered for a spell
while I get a few things in order.

847
01:22:01,554 --> 01:22:03,886
By all means, marshal.

848
01:22:04,722 --> 01:22:06,587
Appreciate it.

849
01:22:13,666 --> 01:22:16,998
How do I know you ain't gonna
try to collect Bragg and skedaddle?

850
01:22:17,168 --> 01:22:20,969
You've known me a long time, Ring.
Long as I've known you.

851
01:22:23,742 --> 01:22:25,403
Two hours.

852
01:22:25,978 --> 01:22:27,842
Stockyards.

853
01:22:28,213 --> 01:22:30,011
I'll be there.

854
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:37,416
Come on, Allie.

855
01:22:39,725 --> 01:22:41,954
Kind of hard not to kiss her back a little...

856
01:22:43,261 --> 01:22:46,095
...seeing's her lips were on mine.

857
01:22:49,935 --> 01:22:52,095
But I held her off.

858
01:22:52,537 --> 01:22:54,938
Told her we weren't with each other.

859
01:22:55,106 --> 01:22:57,131
We were both with you.

860
01:22:58,344 --> 01:23:01,404
She didn't care for it. Got kind of fitful.

861
01:23:07,987 --> 01:23:10,319
I never met a woman like her.

862
01:23:12,824 --> 01:23:18,559
Mostly I've been with whores
and that squaw lady I told you about.

863
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:25,532
She speaks well and dresses fine...

864
01:23:25,938 --> 01:23:28,064
...and she's good-looking...

865
01:23:28,841 --> 01:23:32,037
...she can play the piano,
and she cooks good...

866
01:23:32,211 --> 01:23:34,372
...and she's very clean.

867
01:23:35,814 --> 01:23:38,282
Chews her food nice.

868
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:45,850
But it appears she'll fuck anything ain't gelded.

869
01:23:46,024 --> 01:23:49,619
I'm not certain that's quite right.

870
01:23:49,795 --> 01:23:51,762
What do you think's right?

871
01:23:52,463 --> 01:23:54,728
I think she wants to be with the boss stallion.

872
01:23:54,899 --> 01:23:56,868
There's only one stallion in a herd.

873
01:23:57,302 --> 01:23:58,530
At a time.

874
01:24:20,859 --> 01:24:23,487
So when I'm around, she loves me.

875
01:24:23,662 --> 01:24:25,458
I think so.

876
01:24:26,597 --> 01:24:29,362
When I'm not around, she loves you.

877
01:24:29,534 --> 01:24:30,865
Well, it's probably not love.

878
01:24:31,036 --> 01:24:33,470
When neither one of us is around, she loves Ring.

879
01:24:33,639 --> 01:24:37,301
Again, not so sure I'd say love.

880
01:24:39,645 --> 01:24:41,442
She love me?

881
01:24:43,114 --> 01:24:44,742
What do you think?

882
01:24:47,653 --> 01:24:49,552
I think she does.

883
01:24:49,721 --> 01:24:51,917
You're the one should know.

884
01:24:54,393 --> 01:24:58,351
You know she takes a bath every evening
before she goes to bed?

885
01:25:00,565 --> 01:25:02,625
I like being with her.

886
01:25:02,967 --> 01:25:04,958
Nothing against it.

887
01:25:06,337 --> 01:25:08,328
Just gotta get past this Ring business.

888
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:12,368
- Might not be the last time for that.
- It'll be the last time with Ring.

889
01:25:15,713 --> 01:25:16,805
It's me.

890
01:25:19,851 --> 01:25:21,716
Come in, Allie.

891
01:25:33,899 --> 01:25:36,958
Well, it's all the hotel keeper could find.

892
01:25:37,136 --> 01:25:39,502
You look lovely, Allie.

893
01:25:39,805 --> 01:25:41,533
Truly.

894
01:25:54,886 --> 01:25:56,945
Aren't either of you afraid?

895
01:25:58,323 --> 01:25:59,346
Afraid?

896
01:26:00,458 --> 01:26:02,359
That you might get killed?

897
01:26:03,929 --> 01:26:05,953
Oh, I don't know, Allie.

898
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,729
Guess I don't think about it so much.

899
01:26:12,604 --> 01:26:13,865
Well, I'm afraid.

900
01:26:17,076 --> 01:26:19,043
But I'm afraid all the time.

901
01:26:22,314 --> 01:26:23,337
Of what?

902
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:25,908
Everything.

903
01:26:26,585 --> 01:26:28,314
Like what?

904
01:26:31,756 --> 01:26:33,019
Hm?

905
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:36,654
Like being alone.

906
01:26:37,296 --> 01:26:39,059
Like being with the wrong man.

907
01:26:39,230 --> 01:26:41,494
Not having any money...

908
01:26:41,899 --> 01:26:43,993
...a place to live.

909
01:26:52,511 --> 01:26:54,274
I'll look out for you.

910
01:26:59,150 --> 01:27:00,845
For how long?

911
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:03,614
For as long as you need.

912
01:27:12,864 --> 01:27:15,527
We've done pretty well over time, Virgil.

913
01:27:15,701 --> 01:27:19,761
It's always been just a job.
Never been personal.

914
01:27:22,608 --> 01:27:25,542
We are going up against Ring because of Bragg, right?

915
01:27:25,711 --> 01:27:29,545
You can't be a lawman and let somebody take your prisoner.

916
01:27:46,497 --> 01:27:48,090
Cole!

917
01:27:53,005 --> 01:27:57,305
Like you said, you've known me
a long time, long as I've known you.

918
01:28:01,279 --> 01:28:03,338
Guess you made your first mistake, Virgil...

919
01:28:03,515 --> 01:28:06,847
...locking your prisoner
in my cousin Russell's jail.

920
01:28:10,956 --> 01:28:14,516
I'll take Ring, you take Mackie, then we'll deal upstairs.

921
01:28:14,693 --> 01:28:16,182
Yes, sir.

922
01:28:47,592 --> 01:28:49,117
Virgil.

923
01:28:53,231 --> 01:28:54,721
Virgil.

924
01:28:55,734 --> 01:28:56,962
Virgil.

925
01:28:58,170 --> 01:29:00,764
Left knee's busted.

926
01:29:03,809 --> 01:29:07,869
That happened quick.
- Everybody could shoot.

927
01:29:13,952 --> 01:29:15,543
Virgil.

928
01:29:18,023 --> 01:29:19,684
Virgil.

929
01:29:20,524 --> 01:29:22,082
Virgil.

930
01:29:22,661 --> 01:29:24,185
Allie.

931
01:29:31,036 --> 01:29:36,439
And I want you to know
how embarrassed I am that you saw me...

932
01:29:37,009 --> 01:29:38,340
- You know.
- What?

933
01:29:38,510 --> 01:29:41,342
I am mortified that you saw me with no clothes on.

934
01:29:41,512 --> 01:29:44,073
Oh, Allie, it was an incomparable pleasure.

935
01:29:44,248 --> 01:29:45,476
Oh, Everett.

936
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:47,983
Well, you're the one that started talking about it.

937
01:29:48,153 --> 01:29:52,613
Well, I'm just grateful to you and Everett
that you didn't abandon me.

938
01:29:52,791 --> 01:29:54,622
Well, that is what we were hired to do.

939
01:29:54,792 --> 01:29:58,319
You know, find escaped prisoners
and rescue damsels in distress.

940
01:29:58,497 --> 01:30:01,021
Oh, go on, the both of you.

941
01:30:01,198 --> 01:30:05,033
Pretend like you were just doing what any lawman would do.

942
01:30:05,237 --> 01:30:09,002
I know it in my heart and I treasure it...

943
01:30:09,173 --> 01:30:11,836
...that you did what you did for me.

944
01:30:17,349 --> 01:30:19,715
That's what I was trying to say.

945
01:30:20,319 --> 01:30:23,117
Allie has you in reserve.

946
01:30:23,622 --> 01:30:27,557
- In reserve for what?
- Everett, you ain't stupid.

947
01:30:27,725 --> 01:30:31,855
Virgil dies, you replace him.

948
01:30:33,532 --> 01:30:37,627
- No.
- That's why she's so nice to you.

949
01:30:39,371 --> 01:30:41,965
You don't think she loves Virgil?

950
01:30:44,943 --> 01:30:48,242
Out here, love's pretty hard for a woman.

951
01:30:48,412 --> 01:30:51,314
Mostly it's the men worry about love.

952
01:30:51,515 --> 01:30:52,813
I don't know what she feels.

953
01:30:52,984 --> 01:30:56,646
She probably don't know how she feels either.

954
01:30:56,822 --> 01:31:01,850
She just knows he's the top hand,
and she'll stay with him till he ain't.

955
01:31:11,168 --> 01:31:13,636
Hello, Everett. Hello, Virgil.

956
01:31:13,805 --> 01:31:15,328
What can we do for you boys?

957
01:31:15,506 --> 01:31:21,412
Well, there's a been a strange,
somewhat of an odd occurrence.

958
01:31:21,712 --> 01:31:23,043
Occurrence?

959
01:31:23,215 --> 01:31:26,810
Just came in from the telegraph office minutes ago.

960
01:31:26,984 --> 01:31:29,248
It's from Judge Callison.

961
01:31:42,367 --> 01:31:46,167
"Have received notice
from U.S. Department of Justice.

962
01:31:46,337 --> 01:31:49,171
Randall R. Bragg granted full pardon...

963
01:31:49,341 --> 01:31:52,673
...for murder conviction
in Yaqui County...

964
01:31:52,844 --> 01:31:55,108
...by President Chester A. Arthur."

965
01:31:55,279 --> 01:32:00,512
Evidently, Bragg's claim of association
with our president wasn't just thrasonical.

966
01:32:04,890 --> 01:32:06,585
Boastful.

967
01:32:14,765 --> 01:32:16,063
Thank you, gentlemen.

968
01:32:18,302 --> 01:32:20,635
Why did you just thrust that in his face like that?

969
01:32:20,805 --> 01:32:23,365
- I didn't.
- You thrusted it in his face.

970
01:32:24,810 --> 01:32:27,573
Thanks, Tilda.
- Mr. Cole.

971
01:32:29,713 --> 01:32:31,908
- I'll trade you...
- I know what you're gonna ask.

972
01:32:32,082 --> 01:32:34,176
- Here.
- Do you want my drumstick too?

973
01:32:34,351 --> 01:32:36,546
No. One's plenty.

974
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:37,744
I knew it.

975
01:32:40,091 --> 01:32:42,354
Well, by God.

976
01:32:50,234 --> 01:32:51,930
Mrs. French.

977
01:32:52,503 --> 01:32:54,095
Marshal. Deputy.

978
01:32:59,444 --> 01:33:02,675
- Bygones be bygones.
- Bragg...

979
01:33:03,881 --> 01:33:06,578
...I don't know what kind of deal
you worked...

980
01:33:06,984 --> 01:33:10,421
...but as far as I'm concerned,
you murdered Jack Bell.

981
01:33:11,922 --> 01:33:14,618
Now you're standing here
while I'm trying to have dinner...

982
01:33:14,792 --> 01:33:16,317
...acting like you didn't.

983
01:33:17,229 --> 01:33:20,095
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.

984
01:33:21,666 --> 01:33:23,497
Mrs. French.

985
01:33:25,136 --> 01:33:26,728
Everett.

986
01:33:32,676 --> 01:33:34,201
Gentlemen.

987
01:33:34,378 --> 01:33:37,439
Mr. Bragg. It's very nice to see you.

988
01:33:39,650 --> 01:33:42,141
Why do you think he came back here?

989
01:33:46,358 --> 01:33:47,984
Pride.

990
01:33:49,327 --> 01:33:51,556
It's a funny thing, Allie.

991
01:33:58,103 --> 01:33:59,661
Everett.

992
01:34:00,137 --> 01:34:01,399
Good trip?

993
01:34:01,573 --> 01:34:04,474
Well, Judge Callison says there ain't nothing can be done.

994
01:34:04,643 --> 01:34:07,873
Bragg's attorney appealed the conviction,
said the trial was unfair...

995
01:34:08,046 --> 01:34:10,479
...no bodies were found,
evidence was hearsay.

996
01:34:10,649 --> 01:34:13,880
President granted a pardon
before the appeal was even ruled on.

997
01:34:14,051 --> 01:34:18,853
He's got authority over the territories.
The pardon is real. It's the law.

998
01:34:19,890 --> 01:34:21,518
How's Allie?

999
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:23,752
She's fine.

1000
01:34:31,603 --> 01:34:36,164
Virgil, I've always thought that men like us
do gun work because we can.

1001
01:34:37,442 --> 01:34:40,069
Because we're better at it than most.

1002
01:34:40,278 --> 01:34:44,043
Well, it beats punching cows or digging copper.

1003
01:34:44,215 --> 01:34:46,546
- Yeah.
- Or soldiering.

1004
01:34:47,118 --> 01:34:49,916
You can do it as a peace officer, get paid regularly...

1005
01:34:50,087 --> 01:34:52,283
...and you sort of know
when to do it and how.

1006
01:34:52,457 --> 01:34:54,083
Sounds right.

1007
01:34:57,494 --> 01:35:02,194
Never taken the legal side of it too seriously.

1008
01:35:03,601 --> 01:35:08,038
I mean, figure it's just a way
to feel easier about being a gunman.

1009
01:35:08,206 --> 01:35:12,643
I take it serious.
What the hell am I if I don't?

1010
01:35:32,296 --> 01:35:35,060
I tell you, this town is changing fast.

1011
01:35:35,233 --> 01:35:37,962
That's a fine-looking sign.

1012
01:35:38,136 --> 01:35:39,626
Yup.

1013
01:35:46,243 --> 01:35:48,212
Just send me the bill.
- I will.

1014
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:50,041
Okay.

1015
01:35:51,815 --> 01:35:54,011
Here's to you, Dixie.

1016
01:35:59,858 --> 01:36:01,826
Buy you a drink, Everett?

1017
01:36:01,993 --> 01:36:03,585
Got one.

1018
01:36:04,429 --> 01:36:08,159
I'll have the same, Fat.
And a pretty little glass of sherry.

1019
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,563
So where's your partner?

1020
01:36:10,734 --> 01:36:13,328
He refuses to come in here.

1021
01:36:13,671 --> 01:36:16,368
That's fine, perfectly fine.

1022
01:36:17,274 --> 01:36:18,742
Cigar?

1023
01:36:18,909 --> 01:36:20,844
Don't smoke.

1024
01:36:23,715 --> 01:36:28,152
Listen, I understand why you boys hold it hard against me.

1025
01:36:28,619 --> 01:36:32,112
But I want you to know I'm not the man I was.

1026
01:36:34,993 --> 01:36:36,961
I was hoping we could work together...

1027
01:36:37,127 --> 01:36:40,256
...once you came to see
the truth of my statement.

1028
01:36:41,099 --> 01:36:43,693
That statement being that you're a reformed man?

1029
01:36:43,868 --> 01:36:45,563
I am.

1030
01:36:46,770 --> 01:36:49,831
The city aldermen like what's happening to the town.

1031
01:36:50,108 --> 01:36:54,043
You boys don't get on the right side of things, well...

1032
01:36:54,378 --> 01:36:57,472
...you might find yourselves
without a job.

1033
01:36:58,850 --> 01:37:00,112
How are we doing here?

1034
01:37:02,587 --> 01:37:06,216
Losing money, are you?
Don't lose the hotel in one night.

1035
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:09,417
Here we are, Allie.
Something to warm you up a little bit.

1036
01:37:09,594 --> 01:37:12,791
- Well, thank you, Randall.
- Sitting lonely in the corner...

1037
01:37:12,963 --> 01:37:13,988
Aw.

1038
01:37:14,164 --> 01:37:16,224
...poured into that dress.
- Oh, ha-ha-ha.

1039
01:37:19,203 --> 01:37:21,434
Ever seen one like that?

1040
01:37:21,939 --> 01:37:25,306
Olson says Bragg bought it in England.

1041
01:37:25,609 --> 01:37:27,668
A Herefordshire, they call it.

1042
01:37:27,845 --> 01:37:29,506
That is a fine beast.

1043
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:32,309
Those steers make real good eating.

1044
01:37:34,551 --> 01:37:39,784
One fella told me the other day
Bragg had a big silver strike up in Nevada.

1045
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:46,863
Another swears Bragg and some boys
robbed a train down in Mexico...

1046
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:49,158
...carrying gold.

1047
01:37:53,003 --> 01:37:57,337
I don't suppose it matters one way
or the other where he got all that money.

1048
01:37:58,109 --> 01:38:00,703
Must be something can be done.

1049
01:38:04,314 --> 01:38:06,976
They ain't gonna run me off.

1050
01:38:10,154 --> 01:38:14,216
And Bragg's got Olson and his bunch right in his pocket.

1051
01:38:17,328 --> 01:38:20,024
We got hired. We can get fired.

1052
01:38:20,198 --> 01:38:22,757
Me and Allie got a house here.

1053
01:38:24,269 --> 01:38:26,168
I'm not leaving.

1054
01:38:29,239 --> 01:38:31,503
What are you gonna stay as?

1055
01:38:32,109 --> 01:38:34,340
We ain't come to that yet.

1056
01:38:36,648 --> 01:38:40,083
Might just make some sense to move on.

1057
01:38:44,421 --> 01:38:46,720
Talked this over with Allie?

1058
01:38:47,559 --> 01:38:49,618
She don't wanna leave either?

1059
01:39:10,014 --> 01:39:12,778
I got some things to say, Virgil.

1060
01:39:19,023 --> 01:39:21,923
I stay here, I won't be able to make a living.

1061
01:39:22,926 --> 01:39:24,019
I know.

1062
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:32,229
- I got something else to say.
- She might leave me.

1063
01:39:34,771 --> 01:39:36,103
Yeah.

1064
01:39:37,175 --> 01:39:41,543
- You saw how it was with Ring Shelton.
- I ain't leaving her.

1065
01:39:54,492 --> 01:39:56,015
All right.

1066
01:40:00,998 --> 01:40:02,398
All right.

1067
01:42:38,256 --> 01:42:42,090
I shot a man in Tres Piedras years ago.

1068
01:42:44,028 --> 01:42:46,792
Only time I killed it wasn't legal.

1069
01:43:21,198 --> 01:43:23,292
I'm gonna be leaving.

1070
01:43:36,913 --> 01:43:39,381
More coffee, Mr. Raines?

1071
01:43:40,717 --> 01:43:43,551
- Will there be anything else for you?
- No, thank you.

1072
01:43:53,730 --> 01:43:55,858
Give this to Bragg when he asks for it.

1073
01:43:56,033 --> 01:43:58,796
- Everett.
- Just do it.

1074
01:43:58,970 --> 01:44:00,028
Long notes.

1075
01:44:00,203 --> 01:44:01,864
- Yes.
- Yeah?

1076
01:44:04,908 --> 01:44:06,432
Everett.

1077
01:44:09,079 --> 01:44:11,070
What the hell do you think you're doing?

1078
01:44:11,649 --> 01:44:15,448
You're a lying, back-shooting,
cowardly son of a bitch.

1079
01:44:16,820 --> 01:44:18,618
What is this?

1080
01:44:19,657 --> 01:44:21,556
What is this?

1081
01:44:21,725 --> 01:44:23,488
I'll be out in the street.

1082
01:44:23,661 --> 01:44:27,061
But you're a deputy marshal.
You can't call me out.

1083
01:44:27,631 --> 01:44:29,497
Wallis has a gun for you.

1084
01:44:29,667 --> 01:44:33,158
I'm going outside. You don't come out,
I'll come back in and kill you.

1085
01:44:37,908 --> 01:44:41,503
You think you can pull on me
without your friend Cole to back you up?

1086
01:45:00,864 --> 01:45:02,354
Everett.

1087
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,092
Just leave it, Virgil.

1088
01:45:05,269 --> 01:45:07,737
Just hold on. What's this about?

1089
01:45:08,939 --> 01:45:11,305
I ever ask you for anything?

1090
01:45:13,176 --> 01:45:14,371
Well, I'm asking you now.

1091
01:45:16,479 --> 01:45:18,710
Just leave it alone.

1092
01:45:27,190 --> 01:45:28,988
Just once, Virgil.

1093
01:45:29,894 --> 01:45:31,657
One favor.

1094
01:47:41,458 --> 01:47:44,292
<i>I figured I'd saved Virgil's career as a lawman...</i>

1095
01:47:45,429 --> 01:47:48,329
<i>... and given him another chance
with Allie.</i>

1096
01:47:48,599 --> 01:47:51,625
<i>At least for the foreseeable future.</i>

1097
01:47:52,636 --> 01:47:54,034
<i>As for the unforeseeable...</i>

1098
01:47:54,939 --> 01:47:58,636
<i>... well, it was out there waiting for me.</i>

1099
01:48:00,610 --> 01:48:05,707
<i>I headed straight into the setting sun
and rode west at an easy pace.</i>

1100
01:48:06,182 --> 01:48:08,447
<i>It was gonna be a long ride...</i>

1101
01:48:08,618 --> 01:48:11,349
<i>... and there was no reason to hurry.</i>

1102
01:55:21,150 --> 01:55:23,141
