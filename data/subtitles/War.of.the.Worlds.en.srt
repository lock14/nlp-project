00:01:23,423 --> 00:01:28,291
<i>No one would have believed
in the early years of the 21st century...</i>

3
00:01:30,303 --> 00:01:35,660
<i>...that our world was being watched
by intelligences greater than our own...</i>

4
00:01:38,144 --> 00:01:42,375
<i>...that as men busied themselves
about their various concerns...</i>

5
00:01:43,357 --> 00:01:46,472
<i>...they observed and studied...</i>

6
00:01:48,318 --> 00:01:51,354
<i>...the way a man with a microscope
might scrutinize</i>

7
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:56,893
<i>the creatures that swarm
and multiply in a drop of water.</i>

8
00:01:58,158 --> 00:02:03,390
<i>With infinite complacency,
men went to and fro about the globe...</i>

9
00:02:04,413 --> 00:02:08,724
<i>...confident of our empire
over this world.</i>

10
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:13,622
<i>Yet across the gulf of space,</i>

11
00:02:13,963 --> 00:02:19,161
<i>intellects vast and cool
and unsympathetic...</i>

12
00:02:19,676 --> 00:02:23,190
<i>...regarded our planet
with envious eyes...</i>

13
00:02:24,222 --> 00:02:27,338
<i>...and slowly and surely...</i>

14
00:02:27,683 --> 00:02:31,070
<i>...drew their plans against us.</i>

15
00:03:25,435 --> 00:03:27,869
Tell him to send it over
to the cargo shed.

16
00:03:28,188 --> 00:03:30,098
It's on its way.

17
00:03:43,075 --> 00:03:44,348
Ray.

18
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,787
Ferrier. Whoa.

19
00:03:47,245 --> 00:03:50,441
I need you back in four instead of 12.
I got half of Korea coming in at noon.

20
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,065
No, no, no, I can't.
I'm on a 12-hour blow. Call Tedesco.

21
00:03:54,418 --> 00:03:57,214
Come on. Tedesco can't move
40 containers in an hour.

22
00:03:57,544 --> 00:03:59,614
I gotta have somebody
who can do double picks.

23
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:03,150
I wish I could help you, Sal.
It's the goddamn union regulations.

24
00:04:03,506 --> 00:04:05,576
Come on.
I'm in a position here, Ray.

25
00:04:05,884 --> 00:04:08,875
You remember
the union regulations, Sal.

26
00:04:09,387 --> 00:04:11,297
You know what your problem is?

27
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:14,588
I can think of a couple women
who'd be happy to tell you.

28
00:04:38,283 --> 00:04:40,160
8:30? Did we say that?

29
00:04:40,452 --> 00:04:42,249
We said 8:00.

30
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,036
Hey, this is...

31
00:04:46,457 --> 00:04:49,368
This is one safe-looking new vehicle
you got yourself here, Tim.

32
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,939
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

33
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,635
Eight o'clock, huh?

34
00:04:57,591 --> 00:05:00,230
We'll be back by 9:30 on Sunday,
depending on the traffic.

35
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:04,699
There he is.

36
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:08,785
Get a hug?

37
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,657
Confusing handshake?
Kick in the teeth?

38
00:05:14,438 --> 00:05:15,552
The door's locked.

39
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:17,800
Still working on those manners?

40
00:05:19,983 --> 00:05:21,461
Hello, Dad.

41
00:05:22,694 --> 00:05:24,365
Hello, Rachel.

42
00:05:27,823 --> 00:05:30,814
Yo, Stan, hurry up.
We gotta get to work.

43
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:39,746
Here, honey. Let me
give you a hand getting that inside.

44
00:05:39,983 --> 00:05:41,921
- The door's locked.
- Sweetheart, let me get it.

45
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:45,152
- I don't mind. I don't mind.
- Hey, she said she could get it.

46
00:05:45,404 --> 00:05:47,136
- It's heavy.
- She said she could get it.

47
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,846
It's got rollers. Just roll it, roll it.

48
00:05:48,924 --> 00:05:51,279
Yeah, but we can't roll it
up the stairs, can we?

49
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:53,822
Really, I got it from here, okay?

50
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,101
It's a 302 V8. It's...

51
00:06:02,685 --> 00:06:04,595
It's gonna be out of here next week.

52
00:06:07,187 --> 00:06:09,905
You better get going, you wanna
beat the traffic, don't you think?

53
00:06:11,482 --> 00:06:13,074
You're out of milk.

54
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,337
And everything else.

55
00:06:16,194 --> 00:06:18,230
Yeah.
Could you close the door, please?

56
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,123
Because that's my refrigerator.

57
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:24,299
I'm gonna go wait outside.

58
00:06:26,036 --> 00:06:28,629
Okay, sweetheart.
I'll see you in a few days.

59
00:06:29,372 --> 00:06:30,885
Bye, Tim.

60
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:34,945
- I better get this upstairs.
- Let me... Let me get...

61
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:37,560
- Mom, Mom, Mom.
- Mary Ann...

62
00:06:37,837 --> 00:06:40,397
- Okay, okay.
- Mom, Mom.

63
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:54,553
A little old to still be sharing,
aren't they?

64
00:06:54,641 --> 00:06:57,712
- I don't hear any complaints.
- No, I do.

65
00:07:03,732 --> 00:07:07,963
Robbie's got a paper on the French
occupation of Algeria due Monday,

66
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,031
which he's yet to begin.

67
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,555
It would be nice if he were done
by the time we got back

68
00:07:12,655 --> 00:07:15,248
so we don't have to keep
him up all night on Sunday.

69
00:07:15,574 --> 00:07:17,212
- I just gotta type it up.
- No.

70
00:07:17,493 --> 00:07:20,370
- You just gotta start writing it first.
- I love you, Mom.

71
00:07:21,162 --> 00:07:22,754
I love you.

72
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,143
Listen to your father.

73
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:29,719
Oh, no shoes on the bed.

74
00:07:30,795 --> 00:07:33,023
We'll be at my parents' house
in Boston,

75
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:35,335
but don't call the house line,
you know, they...

76
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,111
Well, the point is, I've got my cell
phone, so if anything comes up

77
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:39,846
or you have any questions,
just call me.

78
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:41,644
Believe it or not, I can handle it.

79
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,600
- I'll leave the phone on.
- Mary Ann.

80
00:07:45,348 --> 00:07:47,497
It's a good look for you.

81
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,201
You think?

82
00:07:52,937 --> 00:07:54,575
Yeah.

83
00:07:56,273 --> 00:07:58,468
Take care of our kids.

84
00:07:59,068 --> 00:08:00,978
Mary Ann,
you got nothing to worry about.

85
00:08:01,278 --> 00:08:05,509
Listen, you tell your mom that
Ray sends his love and kisses.

86
00:08:07,575 --> 00:08:10,134
Right. She'll love that.

87
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,129
<i>The Ukraine,
a country of some 52 million people,</i>

88
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,335
<i>is in almost total blackness tonight,</i>

89
00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:25,743
<i>in the wake of a series
of freakish lightning storms</i>

90
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,638
<i>of catastrophic proportion,</i>

91
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:30,721
<i>which struck the country at
approximately 4 a.m. local time.</i>

92
00:08:33,552 --> 00:08:37,226
<i>EMP, or electromagnetic pulse,
which causes a temporary interruption</i>

93
00:08:37,597 --> 00:08:40,111
<i>of all electrical current
within its field.</i>

94
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:43,505
<i>As in the Ukraine, there are
scattered reports that the EMP here</i>

95
00:08:43,853 --> 00:08:47,128
<i>was followed by seismic activity
on the scale of an earthquake,</i>

96
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:51,109
<i>measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale.
This...</i>

97
00:08:54,237 --> 00:08:57,943
- Baseball season's over.
- Five minutes. It's not gonna kill you.

98
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:01,509
There he is.

99
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:08,087
Boston.

100
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,968
That's how it is?

101
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,051
Is that how it's gonna be?

102
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:20,486
- Careful with that throw.
- Whatever, Ray.

103
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,059
Mom says you got
a report due on Monday,

104
00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:24,924
so you're gonna work on that
when we're done.

105
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:27,106
Yeah, I'm almost finished.
I just gotta type it up.

106
00:09:27,678 --> 00:09:29,236
Yeah, bullshit.

107
00:09:30,514 --> 00:09:33,266
Yeah? What do you know, Ray?

108
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,283
Everything. Haven't you heard?
Between me and my brother,

109
00:09:36,602 --> 00:09:38,274
we know everything.

110
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:41,369
What's the capital of Australia?

111
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,089
That's one my brother knows.

112
00:09:46,693 --> 00:09:50,321
Okay with you if I just laugh the first
500 times you tell that one?

113
00:09:53,198 --> 00:09:56,269
Just do your report. We don't send
you to school so you can flunk out.

114
00:09:57,619 --> 00:09:59,688
You don't pay for it, Tim does.

115
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,422
That's half what I've got.

116
00:10:07,961 --> 00:10:10,713
You're an asshole.
I hate coming here.

117
00:10:11,547 --> 00:10:13,025
That why you act like such a dick?

118
00:10:29,185 --> 00:10:30,379
What?

119
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:33,256
That's not how you're gonna
get through to him.

120
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,847
- If you want him to listen to you...
- What are you, your mother or mine?

121
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:41,923
- Where you going?
- I'm going to sleep, you know?

122
00:10:42,237 --> 00:10:43,465
I work for a living.

123
00:10:45,364 --> 00:10:49,039
- What are we supposed to eat?
- You know, order.

124
00:11:13,094 --> 00:11:15,767
<i>Three and two...</i>

125
00:11:16,931 --> 00:11:19,166
<i>- Electromagnetic storm...
- The storms were tracked...</i>

126
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:23,257
<i>Oh, and I'll have my own little secret.
Good idea, eh, Gary?</i>

127
00:11:23,643 --> 00:11:25,713
<i>- No.
- Oh, what do you know?</i>

128
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:27,772
<i>You're a snail.</i>

129
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,846
What's the matter?

130
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,945
- Got a splinter.
- Oh?

131
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,165
Where'd you get it? Come here.

132
00:11:45,912 --> 00:11:47,470
On your porch railing.

133
00:11:47,747 --> 00:11:51,055
Do you need me to...? What?
To do what? You want me to...?

134
00:11:53,084 --> 00:11:55,722
- You want me to take that out?
- Absolutely not.

135
00:11:56,045 --> 00:11:59,275
Come here.
Let me see it. Let me see.

136
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:00,950
Dad.

137
00:12:01,216 --> 00:12:02,853
- Just look. Don't touch it. Dad.
- Rach.

138
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:06,887
- I can't. You're moving it around.
- Okay, don't touch it. Just look at it.

139
00:12:07,971 --> 00:12:09,370
It's gonna get infected.

140
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:11,477
- No, it won't.
- Yes, it's gonna get infected.

141
00:12:11,558 --> 00:12:13,070
No, it won't.

142
00:12:13,476 --> 00:12:17,263
When it's ready,
my body will just push it out.

143
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,334
- Push it out, huh?
- I read that.

144
00:12:23,818 --> 00:12:25,569
You should get TiVo.

145
00:12:26,485 --> 00:12:28,203
- Tim got it for my room.
- TiVo?

146
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:29,636
It's awesome.

147
00:12:30,822 --> 00:12:33,382
I can watch all my shows
after homework.

148
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:37,300
Yeah, I'll just put it
on my platinum card.

149
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:38,972
Robbie?

150
00:12:39,246 --> 00:12:40,678
Robbie.

151
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,471
What is that?

152
00:12:47,961 --> 00:12:49,313
Hummus.

153
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:52,598
- Hummus?
- From the health-food place.

154
00:12:53,216 --> 00:12:55,445
Kept one of their menus
last time we were here.

155
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,808
You said order.

156
00:13:01,764 --> 00:13:03,560
I meant order food.

157
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,203
Where is Robbie?

158
00:13:06,477 --> 00:13:08,706
- He went out.
- Out where?

159
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,216
I don't know.
He just took your car and left.

160
00:13:12,564 --> 00:13:14,759
<i>Who said that? Who's there?</i>

161
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:17,057
<i>It's the clam burglar.</i>

162
00:13:44,713 --> 00:13:46,112
Steven, look at this.

163
00:13:46,381 --> 00:13:48,814
- What's up?
- Check it out!

164
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:54,812
You ever see something like that?

165
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,527
Springtime, maybe.
Not this time of year.

166
00:13:57,849 --> 00:14:00,522
Come on, we can see better
from the back yard.

167
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,697
You gotta come see this!

168
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:38,794
- That is so weird.
- What?

169
00:14:39,423 --> 00:14:41,459
The wind is blowing
toward the storm.

170
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:43,635
That is weird.

171
00:14:44,093 --> 00:14:45,811
Hey, watch it!

172
00:14:47,722 --> 00:14:50,554
Rachel,
you wanna see something cool?

173
00:15:23,918 --> 00:15:25,350
It's okay.

174
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:27,783
- I wanna go inside.
- It's okay.

175
00:15:28,086 --> 00:15:29,803
I wanna go inside.

176
00:15:30,588 --> 00:15:32,180
Okay, you go ahead.

177
00:15:34,256 --> 00:15:36,486
That's enough weather for me.

178
00:15:37,218 --> 00:15:39,287
Don't wanna go by myself.

179
00:15:44,015 --> 00:15:45,448
It's kind of fun, isn't it?

180
00:15:45,725 --> 00:15:48,318
- No.
- Come on, like the Fourth of July.

181
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:52,249
<i>- No, it's not.
- O, say can...</i>

182
00:16:02,488 --> 00:16:04,126
It's okay. You're fine.

183
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:06,715
- It hit right behind our house.
- Yeah, well, it's...

184
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:08,706
It's not gonna hit there again, okay,

185
00:16:08,994 --> 00:16:12,382
because lightning doesn't strike
twice in the same place. Oh, shit!

186
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,051
Where's Robbie?

187
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,069
I don't know.

188
00:16:24,547 --> 00:16:26,378
Is Robbie okay?

189
00:16:28,677 --> 00:16:30,394
Are you okay?

190
00:16:30,678 --> 00:16:32,509
Where's the thunder?

191
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:34,969
Why won't it stop?

192
00:16:49,025 --> 00:16:50,538
Is it over?

193
00:17:05,996 --> 00:17:07,224
Where are you going?

194
00:17:07,498 --> 00:17:11,251
Just... I'm just checking things out.
Just wait... Wait there.

195
00:17:11,626 --> 00:17:14,094
- Are we gonna be okay?
- I don't know.

196
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:16,576
- You don't know?
- No, I meant, I just... Just...

197
00:17:16,672 --> 00:17:18,230
Rachel, please.

198
00:17:18,508 --> 00:17:21,863
Just stop asking so many questions.
Just wait here.

199
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:01,816
Turn everything off.

200
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,035
Everything is off.

201
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,564
I can't get one freaking thing
to turn on.

202
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,386
You believe this, Ray?
Every single car.

203
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,097
Oh, Jesus. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

204
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,183
- The car just stopped, and...
- You're okay?

205
00:18:18,471 --> 00:18:21,063
- Are you okay? You all right?
- The lightning started to hit.

206
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:23,644
- And me and this other guy...
- Where the hell did you go?

207
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,129
- Over on Lincoln Avenue.
- Lincoln Avenue?

208
00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:27,871
- By the church.
- You saw the lightning?

209
00:18:27,935 --> 00:18:30,005
Yeah, 26 times we counted,
over and over again.

210
00:18:30,313 --> 00:18:33,185
The lightning started to hit.
It opened up this hole or something...

211
00:18:33,315 --> 00:18:35,067
- Twenty-six times?
- Yeah.

212
00:18:36,277 --> 00:18:37,504
- You're okay?
- Yeah.

213
00:18:37,777 --> 00:18:39,813
Good. All right, well,
your sister is in the house,

214
00:18:40,113 --> 00:18:43,183
and I want you to go in that house
and I want you to stay with her, okay?

215
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:47,159
The next time you take my car with
no driver's license and no permission,

216
00:18:47,534 --> 00:18:49,013
I call the cops.

217
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:53,278
You better be there when I get back.

218
00:18:54,165 --> 00:18:56,075
- Yeah.
- Robbie.

219
00:19:01,129 --> 00:19:03,961
Manny, Manny.
Manny, what is it, dead?

220
00:19:04,465 --> 00:19:06,932
All of them. Everything.
Look at this.

221
00:19:07,342 --> 00:19:09,332
- The starter's fried.
- Lightning hit it?

222
00:19:09,635 --> 00:19:11,626
Not even close.
I thought if I changed it...

223
00:19:12,096 --> 00:19:14,325
- Any idea what's going on?
- I'm on my way to find out.

224
00:19:14,639 --> 00:19:16,595
Try changing the solenoid.
It's probably fried.

225
00:19:16,892 --> 00:19:19,451
Right, that's what I said.
I told you that. The solenoid.

226
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:24,534
Hey, they're saying all the
lightning struck down by the church.

227
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,822
What the hell is going on
around here?

228
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:40,358
- Let us through.
- Hey.

229
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,813
- Let us through here.
- Hey.

230
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:43,637
What up, Ray?

231
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:45,606
I should've known
you two were behind this.

232
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,843
Hey, God's pissed off at the
neighborhood, Raymond.

233
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:49,631
- I'll tell you that much.
- You see it?

234
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,045
- You got power where you are?
- Nope. Nothing.

235
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,013
It's the cars, though.
That's the thing.

236
00:19:54,086 --> 00:19:56,182
Solar flare. That's what
this guy told me he heard.

237
00:19:56,271 --> 00:19:58,924
- A solar flare?
- The sun shoots off big blobs of plasma.

238
00:19:59,257 --> 00:20:01,816
They turn into solar flares.
It's the only thing that can kill

239
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,342
- all the electronic stuff.
- Can I tell you something?

240
00:20:04,343 --> 00:20:05,772
The sun does not cause lightning.

241
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,977
- I'm telling you what that guy said.
- I understand,

242
00:20:08,015 --> 00:20:09,647
but it just sounds dumb
when you say...

243
00:20:16,355 --> 00:20:18,033
I never seen anything like this before.

244
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:19,858
That many strikes of lightning
in one spot?

245
00:20:20,425 --> 00:20:22,477
- Is this the only place?
- Come on, put that down.

246
00:20:22,568 --> 00:20:24,559
- You wanna step back, please?
- Step back.

247
00:20:24,862 --> 00:20:26,977
- You're gonna fall in.
- Get back.

248
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:31,791
Back up, people.
People, back up back there.

249
00:20:33,618 --> 00:20:36,415
Move back. Everybody back up.

250
00:20:36,745 --> 00:20:38,224
Move back.

251
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:40,347
Move back.

252
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,271
- Is it hot?
- Back up.

253
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,182
- No.
- Back up.

254
00:20:47,463 --> 00:20:49,101
- It's freezing.
- What is that?

255
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:51,276
Oh, wait. Move. You feel that?

256
00:20:51,548 --> 00:20:54,505
- I feel that.
- Hey, Bobby, come check this out.

257
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,454
- You feel that?
- Feel that?

258
00:20:56,619 --> 00:20:58,511
- Yeah, I feel that.
- What is it, the subway?

259
00:20:58,596 --> 00:21:00,426
- There's no subway here.
- F train, maybe?

260
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,118
That can't be the water main.

261
00:21:02,391 --> 00:21:03,719
There's nothing else down there.

262
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:05,850
- Water main doesn't run through here.
- Feel that?

263
00:21:05,887 --> 00:21:07,759
There's something down there
and it's moving.

264
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:14,801
Everybody move back.

265
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:17,107
Whoa. Back it up. Come on.

266
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:19,468
Let's go.

267
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:22,705
Come on, folks. Back up.
Get back.

268
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,537
Help me out here. Get back.

269
00:21:38,337 --> 00:21:40,175
- Go! Move!
- Everybody get out of the way!

270
00:21:40,255 --> 00:21:42,927
Everyone back up!
Everyone clear the intersection!

271
00:21:43,257 --> 00:21:47,135
Get out of the way! Back up!
Back up! Get out of the way!

272
00:22:04,271 --> 00:22:08,422
- Forget it! Get back!
- Get the hell out of the street!

273
00:22:19,743 --> 00:22:21,301
Move away!

274
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,453
Come on, we gotta
clear this area now!

275
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,467
That's my car!

276
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,152
Go, go.

277
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:23,486
Get the hell out of here!

278
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,526
Oh, my God!

279
00:23:50,565 --> 00:23:51,680
Come on, people! Let's go!

280
00:23:51,942 --> 00:23:53,579
Come on, back up!

281
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,294
Please! Move back!

282
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:20,158
Watch it!

283
00:25:22,762 --> 00:25:24,480
Oh, my God.

284
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,290
Ray, no. Stay, man.

285
00:25:37,315 --> 00:25:39,145
Just stay.

286
00:25:39,441 --> 00:25:43,228
- Just stay back here. Stay back!
- Wow.

287
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,186
Come on.

288
00:28:14,605 --> 00:28:16,436
What happened?

289
00:28:18,651 --> 00:28:20,242
What's going on?

290
00:28:21,361 --> 00:28:23,113
Dad, what's the matter?

291
00:28:24,405 --> 00:28:26,439
What's all that stuff all over you?

292
00:28:30,283 --> 00:28:31,796
- Ray.
- What's all this stuff?

293
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,350
Hello?

294
00:28:34,203 --> 00:28:35,556
Ray?

295
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,806
We're leaving this house
in 60 seconds.

296
00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:14,098
What? Why?
I have no idea what's going on.

297
00:29:14,301 --> 00:29:16,990
All the food from the refrigerator
and the cupboard, put it in here.

298
00:29:17,112 --> 00:29:19,147
- What's going on? Just tell me.
- Just do it.

299
00:29:19,906 --> 00:29:22,215
- Rachel, sweetheart...
- Dad, you're really scaring me.

300
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:24,648
- I need you to get your suitcase,
- Dad.

301
00:29:24,952 --> 00:29:27,307
The one that you brought,
and bring it to me, okay?

302
00:29:27,621 --> 00:29:30,896
Can you just do that for me, darling?
Okay?

303
00:29:45,636 --> 00:29:47,148
I don't think it's a fire.

304
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:51,053
- See? That looks like smoke to me.
- What's happening?

305
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:55,950
I can't tell you now.
We've only got about another minute.

306
00:30:01,898 --> 00:30:03,456
Please.

307
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:05,211
Please.

308
00:30:11,348 --> 00:30:13,718
- Just keep it down.
- Ray, I'm standing right beside you.

309
00:30:13,824 --> 00:30:15,894
Can you please answer me?

310
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:19,609
Just get in the front seat, Robbie.

311
00:30:24,916 --> 00:30:26,435
- Whose car is this?
- Just get in.

312
00:30:26,501 --> 00:30:28,218
Whose car is this?

313
00:30:31,005 --> 00:30:33,359
Hey. Hey, Ray.
You were absolutely right.

314
00:30:33,674 --> 00:30:36,061
That is exact...
I had to change the solen...

315
00:30:37,341 --> 00:30:39,138
Ray? Hey.

316
00:30:39,427 --> 00:30:41,656
Hey, Ray? Ray.

317
00:30:42,846 --> 00:30:44,404
Ray.

318
00:30:45,348 --> 00:30:46,826
What...? Come on, open up.

319
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:48,612
Open the door, come on.

320
00:30:48,893 --> 00:30:51,087
Open the door, Ray.
What are you...?

321
00:30:51,394 --> 00:30:53,294
- Get in, Manny.
- You gotta get out of the car.

322
00:30:53,355 --> 00:30:55,605
- Get in the car.
- It's not my car. It's not your car.

323
00:30:55,623 --> 00:30:57,818
- Manny, Manny, shut up.
- Daddy's acting crazy.

324
00:30:58,025 --> 00:30:59,942
You can't do this.
Guy's gonna come back and...

325
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:01,585
Manny, Manny,
I don't have time to...

326
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,533
You're busting my chops.
I got a shop to run.

327
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:05,040
- Manny, listen to me.
- No, Ray.

328
00:31:05,086 --> 00:31:06,678
Get in, Manny, or you're gonna die.

329
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:08,765
- What do you mean?
- Okay.

330
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,140
All right, get out of the truck. I'm not
kidding now. Get out of the car, Ray.

331
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,007
I'm not gonna get in.
I'm not getting in.

332
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,724
- Manny, get in with us.
- I'm not gonna get in trouble.

333
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:22,192
- Look, I'm not fooling around...
- Close the door, Robbie. Close it.

334
00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:26,605
Ray, bring the car back, Ray.
It's not my car.

335
00:31:31,635 --> 00:31:33,909
Get down!
Get down, get down! Get down!

336
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,414
Is it the terrorists?

337
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,068
- Just get down. Get down! Get down!
- Holy shit!

338
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:12,622
- Where are we going?
- We gotta go.

339
00:32:12,918 --> 00:32:15,128
We got, maybe, like,
the only working car around here.

340
00:32:15,129 --> 00:32:17,766
- I'm not stopping until we're clear of it.
- Clear of what?

341
00:32:18,089 --> 00:32:19,408
- We gotta go.
- What's going on?

342
00:32:19,674 --> 00:32:21,824
- Look, you saw, we're under attack!
- By who?!

343
00:32:22,133 --> 00:32:23,326
Who is attacking us?!

344
00:32:23,592 --> 00:32:26,152
Rachel? Rachel,
you've gotta keep it down.

345
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,619
Rachel. Rachel. Shut up, Rachel.

346
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:32,399
- You're freaking her out!
- Look, I'm driving! Do something!

347
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:34,962
Okay, put them up, Rach.
Make the arms.

348
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:37,862
This space right here, this is yours.
This belongs to you, right?

349
00:32:38,188 --> 00:32:39,616
- Yes.
- You're safe in your space.

350
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,302
- I'm safe.
- You're safe in your space.

351
00:32:41,315 --> 00:32:42,968
Nothing can happen to you
in your space.

352
00:32:42,982 --> 00:32:45,370
Okay. I'm gonna go to the front seat,
I'm gonna talk to Dad.

353
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:46,765
- No.
- I'll be 2 feet away.

354
00:32:47,027 --> 00:32:48,346
- Okay.
- Will you hold my hand?

355
00:32:48,612 --> 00:32:49,960
- Will you hold my hand?
- Yes.

356
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:51,747
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yes.

357
00:32:53,658 --> 00:32:55,693
I wanna know everything you know.

358
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,854
This...

359
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,991
This machine,
it crawled out of the ground,

360
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:03,275
started torching everything.
It was killing everybody.

361
00:33:03,623 --> 00:33:06,183
What is it? Is it terrorists?

362
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:08,968
No, this came
from someplace else.

363
00:33:09,295 --> 00:33:12,889
- What do you mean, like, Europe?
- No, Robbie, not like Europe!

364
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:24,869
That machine,

365
00:33:25,142 --> 00:33:28,212
it was already buried.

366
00:33:28,976 --> 00:33:30,694
Maybe it...

367
00:33:31,186 --> 00:33:34,144
...it came down in the lightning storm.

368
00:33:35,148 --> 00:33:38,856
- They came down in a lightning storm.
- What do you mean, came down?

369
00:33:39,235 --> 00:33:41,789
- You said it was buried.
- No, the machine I'm talking about

370
00:33:41,904 --> 00:33:44,975
was buried, but what
came down in the lightning storm,

371
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,332
what operates it,

372
00:33:47,617 --> 00:33:50,084
that's the... You know.

373
00:33:50,452 --> 00:33:51,521
- The what?
- That's...

374
00:33:51,787 --> 00:33:54,175
Why aren't there any helicopters
or airplanes?

375
00:33:54,497 --> 00:33:56,806
- It's the what?
- Hey, Rach. How you doing?

376
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:58,552
- How is she doing?
- How you doing?

377
00:33:58,625 --> 00:33:59,580
- Fine.
- She's good.

378
00:33:59,835 --> 00:34:02,747
- Good. What was that thing you did?
- Works sometimes.

379
00:34:03,087 --> 00:34:04,959
- She gets claustrophobic.
- Yeah? Hey, Rachel?

380
00:34:05,048 --> 00:34:06,920
- I want Mom.
- Yeah, I know. You feel better?

381
00:34:07,008 --> 00:34:09,965
- I want Mom.
- Yeah? Tell me about it, you know?

382
00:34:10,302 --> 00:34:11,821
- Take me to Mom's.
- What I need is,

383
00:34:11,887 --> 00:34:14,035
I just need you to hold it together
for me, okay?

384
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:15,381
I want Mom!

385
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,669
When you start screaming,
I can't really drive...

386
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:19,165
- Take me to Mom's!
- I know that.

387
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:22,106
- That's where we're going, Rachel.
- Take me to Mom's!

388
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:24,267
I know!

389
00:34:39,824 --> 00:34:41,735
Hurry up, Dad. Come on.

390
00:34:48,874 --> 00:34:50,671
Robbie, get the door.

391
00:34:52,711 --> 00:34:54,268
Mom!

392
00:34:54,545 --> 00:34:55,942
- Mom!
- Mom!

393
00:34:56,212 --> 00:34:57,929
Mom!

394
00:34:58,713 --> 00:35:01,591
Mom? Tim?

395
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:06,637
Mom? Tim?

396
00:35:09,681 --> 00:35:11,194
- Mom?
- Mom?

397
00:35:11,475 --> 00:35:14,511
- Tim?!
- Tim?

398
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:17,600
Tim?

399
00:35:18,397 --> 00:35:20,069
Mom?

400
00:35:21,691 --> 00:35:22,965
They're gone.

401
00:35:23,234 --> 00:35:25,031
Is she dead?

402
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,116
She's not dead. All right?

403
00:35:27,404 --> 00:35:28,632
She's just not here, okay?

404
00:35:28,906 --> 00:35:31,338
- They were never here.
- How do you know?

405
00:35:31,656 --> 00:35:33,692
Because they're
on their way to Boston.

406
00:35:33,992 --> 00:35:35,788
And so they just...

407
00:35:36,077 --> 00:35:38,791
...kept on going up to Boston.
Probably at your grandma's house.

408
00:35:38,912 --> 00:35:39,980
I'm gonna call her.

409
00:35:40,246 --> 00:35:42,885
How come the lights are on here
and not at your place?

410
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:44,480
Because...

411
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:48,298
...nothing bad happened here. Okay?
So we're safe here. All right?

412
00:35:48,669 --> 00:35:50,660
Okay, Rachel? This is your area.

413
00:35:50,963 --> 00:35:54,034
- Okay, you are safe...
- Dad, that's not how it goes.

414
00:35:54,383 --> 00:35:56,943
Okay. Well, are you hungry?
I'll get you some food.

415
00:35:57,261 --> 00:36:00,172
I'm gonna feed you.
Get something to eat.

416
00:36:00,513 --> 00:36:01,862
- What do we have?
- Busy signal.

417
00:36:01,931 --> 00:36:04,285
- Ketchup? Mustard.
- You think all the circuits are down?

418
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,669
Tabasco, barbecue sauce.

419
00:36:06,976 --> 00:36:09,536
This is really good, Robbie.
Vinaigrette. I said pack food.

420
00:36:09,854 --> 00:36:12,606
- What the hell is this?
- That's all that was in your kitchen.

421
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,374
Okay. No, it's all right.

422
00:36:16,568 --> 00:36:18,559
All right. Okay.

423
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:23,148
Food.

424
00:36:23,406 --> 00:36:24,839
Bread.

425
00:36:25,282 --> 00:36:27,796
Okay. We're gonna have...

426
00:36:28,994 --> 00:36:30,665
Let's get some sandwiches.

427
00:36:33,498 --> 00:36:34,975
Wanna see me deal?

428
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,428
Wanna see me deal? Here we go.

429
00:36:37,709 --> 00:36:40,142
There's two for you.
There's two for Robbie.

430
00:36:40,461 --> 00:36:42,452
There's two for me,
one for the house.

431
00:36:45,799 --> 00:36:47,027
Okay.

432
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,972
Maybe after we eat something,
I'll go down and show you guys...

433
00:36:50,302 --> 00:36:52,656
Teach you how to play some poker?
A little five-card stud?

434
00:36:52,971 --> 00:36:55,405
- Maybe a little blackjack.
- I'm allergic to peanut butter.

435
00:36:57,017 --> 00:36:58,051
Since when?

436
00:36:58,851 --> 00:37:00,523
Birth.

437
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:05,252
Okay, well, here.

438
00:37:05,522 --> 00:37:07,512
You can eat the bread. Okay?

439
00:37:07,815 --> 00:37:09,168
I'm not hungry.

440
00:37:10,818 --> 00:37:12,375
Okay, well,

441
00:37:12,652 --> 00:37:14,968
Robbie and I are gonna be
eating peanut-butter sandwiches.

442
00:37:15,071 --> 00:37:17,504
- Want jelly on this sandwich?
- I'm not hungry either.

443
00:37:17,823 --> 00:37:19,779
You're not hungry either?

444
00:37:20,075 --> 00:37:21,110
Okay.

445
00:37:21,368 --> 00:37:24,007
Okay, that's fine.

446
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:25,647
Fine.

447
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:34,784
Everybody just relax, okay?

448
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:38,317
Because we're here now.
We're safe, and we're gonna stay.

449
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,864
In the morning, your mom and Tim
are gonna be here.

450
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,400
And everything's gonna be fine.

451
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,189
Okay?

452
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,348
Okay.

453
00:37:51,016 --> 00:37:53,570
If everything's fine, why do we
have to sleep in the basement?

454
00:37:53,684 --> 00:37:56,675
- We've got perfectly good beds.
- Hey, it's like a slumber party.

455
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,619
What are you afraid
is gonna happen?

456
00:37:58,689 --> 00:38:00,008
Nice basement.

457
00:38:00,274 --> 00:38:03,948
I wanna sleep in my bed.
Got back problems.

458
00:38:05,278 --> 00:38:06,710
Okay. Well...

459
00:38:06,987 --> 00:38:09,547
You know on the Weather Channel
when there's a tornado,

460
00:38:09,865 --> 00:38:12,394
they tell you to go to the basement
for safety? It's like that.

461
00:38:12,408 --> 00:38:14,239
- There's gonna be tornadoes?
- Okay, Rachel?

462
00:38:14,536 --> 00:38:18,892
- Hey, no more talking, okay?
- Could you be a little nicer to me?

463
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,642
God.

464
00:38:25,419 --> 00:38:26,574
- Wanna stay here?
- Yeah.

465
00:38:26,629 --> 00:38:27,982
- Good.
- Good night. Love you.

466
00:38:28,255 --> 00:38:29,892
Love you, Rach.

467
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,311
Is the lightning back?

468
00:39:47,774 --> 00:39:49,810
No, this is something else.

469
00:40:09,624 --> 00:40:12,058
- What's that sound?
- I've never heard that before!

470
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:13,696
Is it them? Is it them?

471
00:40:15,755 --> 00:40:16,790
We gotta go.

472
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:18,919
Where do we go?!
Robbie, this is your house.

473
00:40:19,007 --> 00:40:20,042
Where do we go?!

474
00:40:31,602 --> 00:40:33,034
No, no, no, wait!

475
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:54,551
Are we still alive?

476
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:49,013
Down here.

477
00:42:53,378 --> 00:42:55,208
Were you on this plane?

478
00:42:56,547 --> 00:42:58,663
Are you...?
Are you a passenger?

479
00:43:05,722 --> 00:43:08,474
How you doing?
Wanna help me open this?

480
00:43:11,143 --> 00:43:12,815
Are you a passenger?

481
00:43:13,103 --> 00:43:14,661
He's deaf.

482
00:43:14,938 --> 00:43:18,407
The shell went off right beside him.
Camera on his shoulder saved his life.

483
00:43:18,774 --> 00:43:20,048
You hear that, Max?

484
00:43:20,317 --> 00:43:22,784
Your stupid camera
saved your stupid life.

485
00:43:23,778 --> 00:43:25,496
Where were you?

486
00:43:26,114 --> 00:43:27,944
Out there in the Pine Barrens.

487
00:43:28,866 --> 00:43:30,663
We were attached to
a National Guard unit.

488
00:43:30,952 --> 00:43:32,270
The 83rd Mechanized.

489
00:43:32,536 --> 00:43:34,613
They moved on one of those things
around midnight.

490
00:43:34,953 --> 00:43:36,631
They got some kind of shield
around them.

491
00:43:36,704 --> 00:43:39,498
You can't see it, but everything we fire
at them detonates too early,

492
00:43:39,623 --> 00:43:42,295
before we can get close enough
to cause any damage.

493
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:46,553
When they flash that thing,
everything lights up like Hiroshima.

494
00:43:47,421 --> 00:43:49,491
There's more than one?

495
00:43:50,715 --> 00:43:52,546
You gotta be kidding me, right?

496
00:43:53,844 --> 00:43:55,833
We were feeding New York,
but New York went dark.

497
00:43:56,136 --> 00:43:58,366
So we patched over to D.C.,
they went down.

498
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,273
L.A., Chicago, uplinked to London.

499
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,590
Even called the affiliates to try
to get them to catch the feed,

500
00:44:04,935 --> 00:44:07,449
but nobody answers.
It's the same everywhere.

501
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:12,002
Once the Tripods start to move,
no more news comes out of that area.

502
00:44:22,823 --> 00:44:24,461
My God.

503
00:44:25,576 --> 00:44:27,406
You ain't seen nothing yet.

504
00:44:30,455 --> 00:44:33,571
I saw that storm. I was right
in the middle of one of those.

505
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:35,315
Well, you didn't see it like this.

506
00:44:35,584 --> 00:44:37,859
Those machines come up
from under the ground, right?

507
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:40,922
So that means they must've been
buried here a long time ago.

508
00:44:41,255 --> 00:44:45,167
So who's driving the goddamn things?
Watch the lightning.

509
00:44:45,551 --> 00:44:47,143
Watch it.

510
00:44:48,637 --> 00:44:49,751
Watch the lightning.

511
00:44:50,013 --> 00:44:52,083
Keep watching the lightning.

512
00:44:56,185 --> 00:44:58,062
What is that?

513
00:44:58,354 --> 00:45:02,310
That is them.
They come down in capsules,

514
00:45:02,689 --> 00:45:05,486
riding the lightning into the ground,
into the machines, right?

515
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:10,407
You hear that?

516
00:45:10,695 --> 00:45:12,969
We're getting the hell out of here.

517
00:45:16,534 --> 00:45:18,171
Get in, get in, get in, get in.

518
00:45:19,869 --> 00:45:22,780
Hey, were you on that plane?

519
00:45:24,707 --> 00:45:27,857
That's too bad.
It would've been a really great story.

520
00:45:30,045 --> 00:45:32,080
Look at me. Look at me.

521
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,416
You keep your eyes only on me,
understand?

522
00:45:34,715 --> 00:45:36,545
- Okay.
- Don't look down. Don't look around.

523
00:45:37,384 --> 00:45:40,216
I'm taking you to the car.
You're gonna wanna look around.

524
00:45:40,553 --> 00:45:41,542
But you're not going to.

525
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,932
- Are you?
- No.

526
00:45:44,223 --> 00:45:47,451
You're doing good. You're doing good.
Keep your eyes on me.

527
00:45:47,807 --> 00:45:48,921
I'm going right to Boston.

528
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:51,453
- We're gonna see your mom.
- I'm not gonna look, Dad.

529
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,470
That's a girl. That's my girl.
Now listen.

530
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:55,608
- I want you to close your eyes, okay?
- Okay.

531
00:45:55,689 --> 00:45:57,918
Got them closed? There you go.

532
00:45:58,232 --> 00:46:00,427
- Keep them closed for me.
- Okay.

533
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:06,895
Robbie, get in.

534
00:46:09,115 --> 00:46:10,753
- Robbie, get in!
- Why are you yelling?

535
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:12,546
It's okay.

536
00:46:15,037 --> 00:46:16,389
Get in.

537
00:46:37,163 --> 00:46:39,498
- Why aren't we on the turnpike?
- I don't want everybody

538
00:46:39,598 --> 00:46:42,153
to see that we've got a working car.
We'll stay along the Hudson

539
00:46:42,267 --> 00:46:45,417
till we find an open bridge or ferry,
then we're gonna cross the Hudson.

540
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:49,557
We'll take the back roads across
Connecticut, all the way to Boston.

541
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,818
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know, running, hiding.

542
00:46:53,151 --> 00:46:55,307
- In their basements.
- If we had balls, we'd go back

543
00:46:55,403 --> 00:46:58,712
- and find one of those things and kill it.
- Right. Yeah, good.

544
00:46:59,073 --> 00:47:01,150
Why don't you just let me
make the big decisions.

545
00:47:01,242 --> 00:47:02,640
Which would be when? Never, Ray?

546
00:47:02,809 --> 00:47:04,383
- Never's about your speed.
- Stop it.

547
00:47:04,452 --> 00:47:06,282
Enough of the "Ray" shit. All right?

548
00:47:06,579 --> 00:47:08,006
- It's "Dad," "sir,"
- Don't fight.

549
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:09,990
Or if you want, "Mr. Ferrier."

550
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:13,405
That sounds a little weird to me,
but you decide.

551
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:16,922
- Dad?
- Yes, Rachel.

552
00:47:19,254 --> 00:47:21,403
I've gotta go to the bathroom.

553
00:47:22,382 --> 00:47:24,020
Really?

554
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:32,572
- I gotta go.
- Not so fast, not so fast, all right?

555
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,642
There's two things
we gotta watch out for.

556
00:47:34,934 --> 00:47:37,243
And the second is people
who might want our car.

557
00:47:37,561 --> 00:47:40,154
- There's nobody around.
- Yeah. I gotta go.

558
00:47:47,986 --> 00:47:48,975
All right, Rachel?

559
00:47:49,237 --> 00:47:50,636
Rachel, it's good right there.

560
00:47:50,906 --> 00:47:52,975
I'm not going in front of you guys.

561
00:47:53,282 --> 00:47:57,033
- Just go where I can see you.
- Are you crazy?

562
00:47:57,408 --> 00:47:59,160
- Don't look!
- I'm not gonna look.

563
00:47:59,452 --> 00:48:02,170
- Just stay in sight!
- That's looking!

564
00:48:03,706 --> 00:48:06,378
Okay, well, listen, every time
you guys don't listen to me,

565
00:48:06,708 --> 00:48:10,222
I'm telling your mother, okay?
I'm making a list.

566
00:48:11,503 --> 00:48:13,221
Making a list.

567
00:48:55,497 --> 00:48:58,056
- I told you to stay where I could see you.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

568
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,948
Stop! Stop!

569
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,938
Wait! Stop! Let me on!

570
00:49:17,723 --> 00:49:19,758
Let me on! Give me a hand!

571
00:49:20,058 --> 00:49:21,570
Wait! Stop!

572
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:24,522
- Stop! Give me a hand!
- Kid, you're gonna get run over!

573
00:49:24,852 --> 00:49:27,571
- Give me a hand! You have room!
- Robbie!

574
00:49:27,897 --> 00:49:30,649
- You wanna go in that direction?
- Stop! Stop!

575
00:49:30,983 --> 00:49:33,894
There's nothing living
in that direction, Robbie.

576
00:49:34,235 --> 00:49:36,232
What do you care?
You never gave a shit before.

577
00:49:36,321 --> 00:49:38,276
- You never gave a shit!
- Okay, hard-ass,

578
00:49:38,572 --> 00:49:40,722
what's your plan, huh?
You're in charge now!

579
00:49:40,933 --> 00:49:43,348
- Tell me what we're doing.
- Catch up with these soldiers!

580
00:49:43,451 --> 00:49:46,284
Hook up with whoever else isn't dead,
and we get back at them.

581
00:49:46,621 --> 00:49:49,817
We get back at them.
That's what we do.

582
00:49:50,166 --> 00:49:54,158
Let's try one that doesn't involve your
10-year-old sister joining the Army.

583
00:49:54,544 --> 00:49:56,932
- You have anything like that?
- Just tell us the truth.

584
00:49:57,254 --> 00:49:59,490
- Wanna try that?
- You have no idea which way to go.

585
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:01,500
You wanna come off all wise and shit!

586
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,266
You only chose Boston
because you hope Mom is there.

587
00:50:04,592 --> 00:50:06,741
And if she's there,
you can dump us on her.

588
00:50:07,052 --> 00:50:10,361
You can dump us on her, then you'll
only have to care about yourself,

589
00:50:10,722 --> 00:50:14,236
which is exactly the way you like it.

590
00:50:15,391 --> 00:50:16,665
Robbie!

591
00:50:16,935 --> 00:50:18,971
Where are you trying to go?

592
00:50:19,269 --> 00:50:21,783
What are you trying to do?

593
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:25,567
Who's gonna take care of me
if you go?

594
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,258
<i>This is a test of
the Emergency Alert System.</i>

595
00:50:47,126 --> 00:50:49,639
<i>If this had been an actual emergency,
official messages</i>

596
00:50:49,961 --> 00:50:53,635
<i>from federal, state or local authorities
would've followed the alert tone.</i>

597
00:50:54,006 --> 00:50:56,599
<i>This concludes the test
of the Emergency Alert...</i>

598
00:50:58,594 --> 00:51:01,187
I'll close my eyes.
Why don't you drive for a bit.

599
00:51:02,388 --> 00:51:04,344
I don't have a license.

600
00:51:05,557 --> 00:51:07,787
Since when has that stopped you?

601
00:51:38,541 --> 00:51:40,179
Ray.

602
00:51:42,252 --> 00:51:43,510
Ray! Dad!

603
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:44,825
Ray! Dad!

604
00:51:48,258 --> 00:51:49,532
You think you could...?

605
00:51:49,801 --> 00:51:52,360
You think you could...?
Do you think you could...?

606
00:51:53,345 --> 00:51:54,664
Don't stop.

607
00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:56,885
Don't take your foot off. Okay?

608
00:51:57,182 --> 00:51:59,616
I got it, but keep your foot on.
Okay, I got it. I got it.

609
00:51:59,935 --> 00:52:02,971
- Where is everybody going?
- I don't know, Rach.

610
00:52:03,312 --> 00:52:05,188
But we do, right?

611
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,277
Yeah, we do.

612
00:52:19,198 --> 00:52:20,755
Why did he do that?

613
00:52:23,033 --> 00:52:25,110
- Why is he doing that?
- He wants a ride, Rach.

614
00:52:25,202 --> 00:52:28,113
- Everybody just wants a ride.
- Can we give him one?

615
00:52:28,455 --> 00:52:31,891
Sit back and put on your seat belt.
Robbie, put on your seat belt.

616
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:34,080
Put on your seat belt, Rachel.

617
00:52:37,379 --> 00:52:39,176
- Be careful.
- How'd you fix this?

618
00:52:39,464 --> 00:52:42,819
- How'd you fix the car?
- Please! Why won't you help us?

619
00:52:44,886 --> 00:52:46,603
I'm sorry, I can't. I can't.

620
00:52:46,887 --> 00:52:48,286
Please, get away from the car.

621
00:52:48,555 --> 00:52:50,510
Hey! Stop the car.

622
00:52:50,806 --> 00:52:53,400
- Stop the car!
- Get off the car!

623
00:52:54,435 --> 00:52:56,425
You could carry 20 people in there!

624
00:52:56,728 --> 00:52:58,683
- Stop the car!
- Get off the car!

625
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,537
Stop the car!

626
00:53:04,859 --> 00:53:06,577
Hold on.

627
00:53:06,861 --> 00:53:07,816
Look out!

628
00:53:08,071 --> 00:53:09,549
Watch out! Hold on!

629
00:53:18,704 --> 00:53:19,739
Are you okay?

630
00:53:33,382 --> 00:53:35,100
No, wait! Wait!

631
00:53:35,384 --> 00:53:37,772
No! Just wait! Okay! Wait! Stop!

632
00:53:38,094 --> 00:53:39,891
- Just stop!
- Daddy!

633
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,611
Rachel!

634
00:53:42,347 --> 00:53:43,985
Get out of there!

635
00:53:45,433 --> 00:53:47,150
Robbie!

636
00:53:54,607 --> 00:53:56,358
Robbie!

637
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,959
- Ray!
- Get in the car!

638
00:54:04,114 --> 00:54:06,674
- Help!
- Rachel! Get out of the car!

639
00:54:06,992 --> 00:54:08,902
Rachel, get...
Get out of the car.

640
00:54:09,202 --> 00:54:11,477
- Get out!
- Daddy!

641
00:54:19,002 --> 00:54:20,993
- Take it easy!
- Get off the car!

642
00:54:21,296 --> 00:54:22,614
Get off!

643
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,277
Get off the car! Move!

644
00:54:24,547 --> 00:54:26,184
Move!

645
00:54:26,464 --> 00:54:28,381
- Where's my son?
- You don't need that, man.

646
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:30,854
- Where's my son? Robbie!
- Cool down, man.

647
00:54:31,176 --> 00:54:32,972
- Put the gun down, man.
- Robbie!

648
00:54:39,183 --> 00:54:40,695
Dad!

649
00:54:42,602 --> 00:54:44,194
Okay, now, listen.

650
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:47,311
- Put down the gun. I'm taking the car.
- My daughter's in the car.

651
00:54:47,548 --> 00:54:49,625
- I'm taking the car, man.
- Please. All I want...

652
00:54:49,816 --> 00:54:52,330
- Put down the goddamn gun!
- All I want is my daughter.

653
00:54:52,652 --> 00:54:55,081
- I'm taking the car, man.
- Please, I just want my daughter.

654
00:54:55,196 --> 00:54:57,073
Let me just take my daughter.
Can I...?

655
00:54:57,365 --> 00:55:00,322
- All I want is my daughter.
- Yeah. Okay, go ahead, man.

656
00:55:01,118 --> 00:55:02,597
Robbie.

657
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:15,639
Take me with you!

658
00:56:17,135 --> 00:56:18,966
Have you seen this girl?
This is my daughter.

659
00:56:19,262 --> 00:56:21,014
He needs his medicine.

660
00:56:32,897 --> 00:56:34,726
We've got it the worst,
that's what I heard.

661
00:56:35,023 --> 00:56:37,820
The U.S., mostly.
South America and Asia, some.

662
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:39,707
There's nothing going on in Europe.

663
00:56:39,984 --> 00:56:42,498
Europe got the worst of it,
that's what everybody's saying.

664
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:45,314
- Completely wiped out some of it.
- I don't give a shit who it is.

665
00:56:45,322 --> 00:56:47,597
I got up close to one of those things
in Stanfordville.

666
00:56:47,908 --> 00:56:49,665
If they're all over the place,
we're dead.

667
00:56:49,742 --> 00:56:52,381
- Looks like the power's still on here.
- Yeah.

668
00:56:52,704 --> 00:56:54,659
Yeah, power's still on.

669
00:56:54,955 --> 00:56:57,946
Because nothing bad's come up
from the ground.

670
00:56:58,291 --> 00:57:01,442
- Hold on. Hold on, move back!
- Watch out there, lady!

671
00:57:01,795 --> 00:57:03,671
I said, move back!

672
00:57:40,199 --> 00:57:43,236
Unless you are O-positive
and RH-negative,

673
00:57:43,578 --> 00:57:47,536
thank you very much, but we already
have more blood than we can use.

674
00:57:47,914 --> 00:57:54,351
Again, if you are O-positive,
RH-negative, identify yourselves.

675
00:57:54,836 --> 00:57:56,792
If you are not, thank you very much.

676
00:57:57,089 --> 00:58:00,045
We already have more blood
than we can use for the transfusions.

677
00:58:00,382 --> 00:58:02,100
Let's go, folks.

678
00:58:02,383 --> 00:58:05,181
This way. This way.
Keep it moving.

679
00:58:05,511 --> 00:58:09,344
Keep it moving. This way.
Let's go, folks. Keep it moving.

680
00:58:09,723 --> 00:58:13,510
Please move forward calmly.
The boat can make more than one trip.

681
00:58:13,893 --> 00:58:18,010
Please move forward calmly.
Take your time. Don't rush.

682
00:58:18,397 --> 00:58:20,546
Ray! Ray! Ray!

683
00:58:20,857 --> 00:58:23,087
- Sheryl?
- Yeah. Hey.

684
00:58:23,401 --> 00:58:25,072
Oh, my gosh, is this your...?

685
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,675
- Are these your kids?
- Rachel.

686
00:58:26,737 --> 00:58:29,126
Hi, I'm Sheryl.
This is my daughter, Nora.

687
00:58:29,448 --> 00:58:31,563
- Nora. I've heard about you, Nora.
- Hi.

688
00:58:31,866 --> 00:58:34,584
- This is my son, Robbie.
- Just like Dad.

689
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,877
- It's good to see you as well.
- Trees are funny.

690
00:58:53,214 --> 00:58:57,172
We're gonna move a few cars out
of the way to make some more space.

691
00:58:58,427 --> 00:59:00,418
You're gonna have to give us
a few minutes.

692
00:59:00,721 --> 00:59:03,598
But don't worry,
there'll be plenty of room for everybody.

693
00:59:04,057 --> 00:59:06,252
We got sick people here.
Let us on.

694
00:59:42,295 --> 00:59:44,649
Cast off. Get that ramp up.

695
00:59:44,964 --> 00:59:47,796
Cast off now. Get that ramp up.

696
00:59:48,133 --> 00:59:49,248
Cast off.

697
00:59:49,509 --> 00:59:52,306
No more people. No more people.
We're taking the ramp up.

698
01:00:18,074 --> 01:00:21,145
Stay close. Stay close.

699
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:24,132
Everybody stop. Everybody stop.

700
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,843
- Wait, wait, wait. Just...
- Back up. Back up.

701
01:00:28,066 --> 01:00:29,434
- There's room.
- Just stay back.

702
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,899
No more room.
There's no more room.

703
01:00:31,168 --> 01:00:32,767
Just listen to me.
There's three of us.

704
01:00:32,836 --> 01:00:34,985
- Five. There's only five of us.
- There's no room.

705
01:00:35,296 --> 01:00:36,690
Okay, man, just don't push me.

706
01:00:36,756 --> 01:00:38,905
- Sir, there's no more room.
- There's plenty of room.

707
01:00:39,216 --> 01:00:41,366
- There's room for hundreds more.
- Sir...

708
01:00:41,677 --> 01:00:42,945
- Everybody, wait.
- Hold on.

709
01:00:43,011 --> 01:00:44,284
- You just stay with me.
- Okay.

710
01:00:44,553 --> 01:00:45,508
Grab my jacket.

711
01:00:45,763 --> 01:00:47,195
Everybody back up.

712
01:00:47,472 --> 01:00:48,461
Back up.

713
01:00:48,723 --> 01:00:50,076
I got you, Ferrier.

714
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:52,067
- Oh, Jesus.
- You okay?

715
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,304
- Yeah.
- Come on.

716
01:00:53,558 --> 01:00:55,355
- Okay, Jesus. Oh, my God.
- Come on.

717
01:00:56,103 --> 01:00:57,694
Watch out.

718
01:01:05,027 --> 01:01:05,981
Come on.

719
01:01:07,528 --> 01:01:09,086
Oh, Ray.

720
01:01:09,364 --> 01:01:11,081
Ray!

721
01:01:12,199 --> 01:01:13,757
Come on. Come on.

722
01:01:15,827 --> 01:01:17,545
Go. I can go with him.

723
01:01:18,037 --> 01:01:19,469
Sheryl?

724
01:01:19,872 --> 01:01:21,828
Go with them. Go.

725
01:01:22,124 --> 01:01:23,079
- Ray.
- Sheryl?

726
01:01:23,334 --> 01:01:24,891
- Everybody...
- Sheryl?

727
01:01:25,168 --> 01:01:27,841
- There's room on the boat.
- Let us through, goddamn it.

728
01:01:28,171 --> 01:01:30,281
- There's still room on the boat.
- She's a child.

729
01:01:30,381 --> 01:01:31,855
- Robbie.
- There's room on the...

730
01:01:31,924 --> 01:01:34,995
There's still room on the boat.
There's room on the boat.

731
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:41,772
- Robbie.
- Just stay with me.

732
01:01:42,057 --> 01:01:43,933
Stay with me, Robbie.

733
01:01:47,768 --> 01:01:49,247
Robbie!

734
01:02:14,373 --> 01:02:16,523
- Robbie, Robbie.
- Robbie!

735
01:02:16,834 --> 01:02:18,711
Robbie!

736
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:23,975
- Robbie.
- Come on.

737
01:02:24,715 --> 01:02:27,024
Here. Grab my hand.

738
01:02:27,342 --> 01:02:28,296
Here. Hold on.

739
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:31,296
I got you. Hold on.

740
01:02:31,596 --> 01:02:33,313
Take my hand.

741
01:02:33,597 --> 01:02:35,474
Take it. Take my hand.

742
01:02:35,766 --> 01:02:37,085
Here!

743
01:02:57,533 --> 01:02:59,888
Oh, my God.

744
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:19,795
Robbie!

745
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:06,040
Swim. Swim this way!

746
01:04:59,795 --> 01:05:02,707
- Robbie, help me with her.
- Here, Rach.

747
01:05:05,592 --> 01:05:08,026
Don't stop. Don't stop.

748
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:10,311
Don't stop.

749
01:05:27,191 --> 01:05:29,022
Oh, my God.

750
01:06:32,076 --> 01:06:34,112
Robbie, slow down.

751
01:06:44,002 --> 01:06:45,354
Robbie, slow down.

752
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:02,191
- Robbie.
- We gotta stay together, Robbie.

753
01:07:04,601 --> 01:07:06,000
Robbie?

754
01:07:06,395 --> 01:07:07,510
Stay together.

755
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:09,249
Robbie!

756
01:07:12,649 --> 01:07:14,685
Get back here!

757
01:07:19,405 --> 01:07:20,724
Robbie!

758
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:22,784
No, Robbie!

759
01:07:23,073 --> 01:07:24,188
Come back!

760
01:07:31,997 --> 01:07:33,555
Robbie.

761
01:07:33,832 --> 01:07:35,549
Don't move. Don't move.

762
01:07:35,833 --> 01:07:38,506
Now for God's sake, stay right here.
I'm coming right back.

763
01:07:38,836 --> 01:07:40,712
- Robbie!
- Stop those people.

764
01:07:41,004 --> 01:07:42,881
- Turn around. Turn around.
- Robbie.

765
01:07:43,716 --> 01:07:44,989
Robbie.

766
01:07:45,258 --> 01:07:46,407
Robbie.

767
01:07:46,676 --> 01:07:47,791
What the hell?

768
01:07:48,053 --> 01:07:50,008
Why are you doing this?

769
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:56,665
Pull back.
Five hundred meters to my 10 o'clock.

770
01:07:58,853 --> 01:08:00,923
Jekyll, no effect on target.
No effect.

771
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:02,219
Roger. No effect.

772
01:08:02,607 --> 01:08:05,244
Our mission, lieutenant,
is to delay their advance

773
01:08:05,566 --> 01:08:07,953
till those refugees get to safety.
Now, keep firing.

774
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:13,204
You've gotta listen. Turn around!
I want you to listen to me.

775
01:08:16,407 --> 01:08:17,362
Listen to me.

776
01:08:17,616 --> 01:08:19,095
Go back down the hill!

777
01:08:19,368 --> 01:08:21,517
All of you, just turn around!

778
01:08:34,172 --> 01:08:36,541
- Don't do this. I know you wanna fight.
- I wanna be here.

779
01:08:36,549 --> 01:08:37,504
I need to see this.

780
01:08:37,758 --> 01:08:39,391
It seems like you have to,
but you don't.

781
01:08:39,468 --> 01:08:41,106
- Please, let me go.
- You don't.

782
01:08:41,386 --> 01:08:43,377
Okay. Wait. Wait.

783
01:08:43,889 --> 01:08:45,526
What are you doing here
all by yourself?

784
01:08:45,807 --> 01:08:47,486
Sweetie, you gotta come with us,
please.

785
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,675
No. My dad's getting my brother.
I have to stay here.

786
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:51,069
- You can't stay here.
- Gotta go.

787
01:08:51,088 --> 01:08:52,801
- I'm not gonna leave her alone.
- Leave.

788
01:08:52,854 --> 01:08:54,805
I'm not letting you do this.
You can hate me.

789
01:08:54,896 --> 01:08:56,211
- You can hate me.
- Let me go.

790
01:08:56,273 --> 01:08:57,428
- But I love you.
- Please.

791
01:08:57,442 --> 01:08:58,890
- I'm not letting you do this.
- Dad.

792
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:01,255
I can't. No. Please.
Please don't pull me.

793
01:09:01,569 --> 01:09:04,236
It's gonna be okay. You need
to come with us. It is not safe...

794
01:09:04,363 --> 01:09:05,955
Please. I can't go with you.

795
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,792
- My dad's right there.
- Please, come.

796
01:09:07,864 --> 01:09:09,836
- Please, my dad's right there.
- Listen to me...

797
01:09:09,885 --> 01:09:12,318
I need to be here. I want to see this.

798
01:09:12,743 --> 01:09:15,052
Wait. Wait... Just stay for Rachel.
Stay for your sister.

799
01:09:15,371 --> 01:09:18,726
Please, let me go.
You need to let me go.

800
01:09:22,377 --> 01:09:23,532
All right. Okay. All right.

801
01:09:23,586 --> 01:09:24,980
- You're coming with us.
- Dad.

802
01:09:25,046 --> 01:09:26,797
- We're going now.
- I can't.

803
01:09:27,089 --> 01:09:28,408
Dad!

804
01:09:32,425 --> 01:09:33,460
Dad.

805
01:09:34,885 --> 01:09:36,716
Dad!

806
01:09:41,849 --> 01:09:44,601
Let me go! Dad!

807
01:09:46,937 --> 01:09:47,972
Guide on. Guide on.

808
01:09:48,229 --> 01:09:50,140
Black Six. Attack. Attack. Attack.

809
01:09:52,733 --> 01:09:54,166
Stop.

810
01:09:54,526 --> 01:09:57,198
- That's my dad.
- I'm her father. I'm her father.

811
01:09:57,529 --> 01:09:59,406
- We're so sorry.
- We thought she was alone.

812
01:09:59,697 --> 01:10:02,972
- She was standing by the tree...
- She's fine. Let's go! Let's go!

813
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:07,605
Robbie.

814
01:10:17,877 --> 01:10:20,185
Robbie!

815
01:10:38,519 --> 01:10:39,838
Over here.

816
01:10:40,104 --> 01:10:41,173
Over here!

817
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:46,708
Hurry.

818
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:08,013
Are you all right?

819
01:11:08,335 --> 01:11:09,688
Hey.

820
01:11:11,838 --> 01:11:13,953
What about you, huh?

821
01:11:27,642 --> 01:11:29,359
There you go.

822
01:11:31,019 --> 01:11:32,896
Is that comfortable?

823
01:11:34,939 --> 01:11:37,407
I need you to close
your eyes now, okay?

824
01:11:37,776 --> 01:11:39,527
You need some sleep.

825
01:11:41,862 --> 01:11:43,258
Dad?

826
01:11:43,527 --> 01:11:45,165
He's gonna meet us.

827
01:11:46,364 --> 01:11:48,479
Hey. Robbie's gonna meet us, Rach.

828
01:11:48,782 --> 01:11:51,012
In Boston, at your grandma's.

829
01:11:51,326 --> 01:11:54,317
What do you think
Mom's doing right this minute?

830
01:11:54,662 --> 01:11:56,061
Mom?

831
01:11:57,247 --> 01:11:59,238
Boston. She's waiting.

832
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:03,105
And I know she's not sleeping,
because she is so worried about you.

833
01:12:03,461 --> 01:12:04,940
And she's in Grandma's kitchen,

834
01:12:05,213 --> 01:12:06,611
and she's...

835
01:12:08,465 --> 01:12:11,217
She's making that awful tea
she makes.

836
01:12:11,551 --> 01:12:13,303
And they're all just...

837
01:12:14,095 --> 01:12:17,290
They're all just counting the minutes
until they see you again.

838
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:20,959
What is this?

839
01:12:21,225 --> 01:12:22,499
What is this?

840
01:12:23,227 --> 01:12:24,295
I won.

841
01:12:24,561 --> 01:12:25,754
You won?

842
01:12:26,019 --> 01:12:28,135
The walk, trot and canter.

843
01:12:28,439 --> 01:12:30,269
Third place.

844
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:41,249
Sing me "Lullaby and Goodnight."

845
01:12:45,536 --> 01:12:47,366
I don't know that one.

846
01:12:48,496 --> 01:12:50,452
Sing me "Hushabye Mountain."

847
01:12:54,126 --> 01:12:55,241
I'm sorry, Rach. I don't...

848
01:12:55,503 --> 01:12:57,458
I don't know that one either.

849
01:13:18,688 --> 01:13:21,962
<i>I'm not bragging, babe
So don't put me down</i>

850
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:25,764
<i>'Cause I got the fastest
Set of wheels in town</i>

851
01:13:26,109 --> 01:13:29,020
<i>Something comes up to me
They don't even try</i>

852
01:13:30,863 --> 01:13:34,172
<i>'Cause if I had a set of wings
Man, you know she could fly</i>

853
01:13:34,783 --> 01:13:37,216
<i>She's my little deuce coupe</i>

854
01:13:38,161 --> 01:13:40,436
<i>You don't know what I got</i>

855
01:13:41,831 --> 01:13:44,139
<i>Just my little deuce coupe</i>

856
01:13:46,626 --> 01:13:48,742
<i>You don't know what I got</i>

857
01:13:57,133 --> 01:13:58,691
Peach schnapps.

858
01:13:58,968 --> 01:14:00,480
Disgusting, I know it.

859
01:14:00,761 --> 01:14:02,956
Found a whole case of this shit.

860
01:14:09,726 --> 01:14:11,364
Thank you.

861
01:14:16,608 --> 01:14:18,598
I'm sorry about your son.

862
01:14:18,901 --> 01:14:20,380
We got separated. He's...

863
01:14:20,653 --> 01:14:23,609
He's gonna meet us in Boston.

864
01:14:30,368 --> 01:14:31,323
Did you...?

865
01:14:33,829 --> 01:14:35,978
Did you lose anybody?

866
01:14:38,123 --> 01:14:39,795
All of them.

867
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:45,144
Harlan Ogilvy.

868
01:14:46,213 --> 01:14:47,532
Ray Ferrier.

869
01:14:47,798 --> 01:14:49,356
I got water.

870
01:14:50,717 --> 01:14:52,787
Food enough for weeks.

871
01:14:53,762 --> 01:14:56,355
You're welcome to stay. Both of youse.

872
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:58,272
I'm sorry.

873
01:14:59,433 --> 01:15:01,388
I'm gonna get some sleep.

874
01:15:03,228 --> 01:15:05,661
Those machines, those...

875
01:15:06,022 --> 01:15:08,058
...Tripods they got?

876
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,231
They buried them.

877
01:15:13,237 --> 01:15:15,306
Right under our feet.

878
01:15:16,489 --> 01:15:18,399
Since before there...

879
01:15:18,864 --> 01:15:21,014
There were even people here.

880
01:15:21,868 --> 01:15:24,665
They've been planning this
for a million years.

881
01:15:26,662 --> 01:15:28,094
We're beat to shit.

882
01:15:28,371 --> 01:15:29,440
Please.

883
01:15:29,706 --> 01:15:31,742
- My daughter...
- Think about it.

884
01:15:35,086 --> 01:15:38,361
They defeated the greatest power
in the world in a couple days.

885
01:15:38,714 --> 01:15:40,670
Walked right over us.

886
01:15:41,132 --> 01:15:43,851
And these are only the first.
They'll keep coming.

887
01:15:45,386 --> 01:15:46,659
This is not a war

888
01:15:46,929 --> 01:15:49,727
any more than there's
a war between men and maggots.

889
01:15:50,306 --> 01:15:52,866
This is an extermination.

890
01:16:03,107 --> 01:16:04,858
Are you afraid?

891
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:08,282
Of course I am.

892
01:16:10,947 --> 01:16:13,255
I been around death plenty.

893
01:16:14,449 --> 01:16:16,041
I drive an ambulance in the city...

894
01:16:16,326 --> 01:16:18,634
Drove an ambulance in the city.

895
01:16:18,953 --> 01:16:21,262
That's all over now, huh?

896
01:16:24,416 --> 01:16:27,134
You know the people
that make it, Ray?

897
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:30,906
The ones that don't flatline
before the hospital?

898
01:16:33,548 --> 01:16:36,425
It's the ones
that keep their eyes open.

899
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:38,487
That keep looking at you.

900
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:40,274
Keep thinking.

901
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:42,783
They're the ones that survive.

902
01:16:44,557 --> 01:16:46,785
We can't lose our heads, Ray.

903
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:50,322
Running.

904
01:16:50,978 --> 01:16:52,855
That's what'll kill you.

905
01:16:54,564 --> 01:16:57,032
And I'm dead set on living.

906
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:04,679
Dead set on living...

907
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:09,724
Thank you for taking us in.

908
01:17:16,792 --> 01:17:18,986
Not gonna be exterminated.

909
01:17:34,805 --> 01:17:36,442
It's okay. Come on.

910
01:17:36,722 --> 01:17:38,360
I wanna show you something.

911
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:40,782
We're gonna fight them, Ray.

912
01:17:41,059 --> 01:17:42,174
They gotta have a weakness.

913
01:17:42,436 --> 01:17:43,994
Come on. Take a look.

914
01:17:51,902 --> 01:17:54,131
Somehow they killed
a few of these things in Osaka.

915
01:17:54,445 --> 01:17:55,400
That's what I heard.

916
01:17:55,655 --> 01:17:58,130
You telling me the Japanese
can figure it out, but we can't?

917
01:17:58,241 --> 01:17:59,593
We can do this, Ray.

918
01:17:59,867 --> 01:18:01,539
We can do it. We can get them.

919
01:18:01,827 --> 01:18:03,578
We can figure it out.

920
01:18:04,245 --> 01:18:05,963
Stay right there.

921
01:18:25,345 --> 01:18:27,062
I have a daughter.

922
01:18:27,346 --> 01:18:28,665
Why did you bring us here?

923
01:18:28,931 --> 01:18:31,490
To fight them together, Ray.

924
01:18:31,849 --> 01:18:35,157
Now we'll be the ones coming up
from underground.

925
01:18:36,853 --> 01:18:38,002
When the time is right...

926
01:18:38,855 --> 01:18:41,049
...take them by surprise,
the way they took us.

927
01:18:42,191 --> 01:18:44,306
Take them by surprise.

928
01:18:45,526 --> 01:18:47,000
We're right under their feet, Ray.

929
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:49,822
Right here. Under their feet.

930
01:19:38,568 --> 01:19:40,444
You miss your mommy?

931
01:19:41,237 --> 01:19:43,273
I had a little girl.

932
01:19:44,072 --> 01:19:45,425
Nearly your age.

933
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:49,088
You know, if anything happens
to your daddy,

934
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:50,923
I'll take care of you.

935
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:52,556
Rachel.

936
01:20:00,711 --> 01:20:02,621
You don't have
anything to say to her.

937
01:20:02,921 --> 01:20:04,400
Do you understand?

938
01:20:05,173 --> 01:20:06,731
If you wanna talk to somebody,

939
01:20:07,008 --> 01:20:08,687
if you wanna ask a question,
you ask me.

940
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,115
What exactly is your plan, Ray?

941
01:20:11,429 --> 01:20:14,226
I know what I'm gonna do.
How about you?

942
01:20:14,556 --> 01:20:17,513
You gonna sit here?
Wait for them to come get you?

943
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:19,568
Is that your plan?

944
01:20:21,353 --> 01:20:23,467
Maybe you wanna get caught.

945
01:20:23,937 --> 01:20:27,292
Couple days hiding in a basement
too much for you, I bet.

946
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:29,240
You'll probably turn yourself right in.

947
01:20:33,445 --> 01:20:34,718
Listen.

948
01:20:36,114 --> 01:20:37,342
It stopped.

949
01:20:37,615 --> 01:20:38,843
Maybe you'll be okay.

950
01:20:39,116 --> 01:20:41,754
Maybe you'll get lucky,
and they'll train you as their pet.

951
01:20:42,076 --> 01:20:44,873
You know, feed you,
train you how to do tricks.

952
01:20:45,203 --> 01:20:46,352
Will you shut up and listen?

953
01:22:44,047 --> 01:22:45,241
<i>No.</i>

954
01:22:47,883 --> 01:22:49,362
<i>No. No.</i>

955
01:22:50,886 --> 01:22:52,113
No.

956
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:17,982
Give me that.

957
01:28:51,504 --> 01:28:53,176
You and me...

958
01:28:54,506 --> 01:28:57,384
...I don't think
we're on the same page.

959
01:29:34,037 --> 01:29:36,550
Ray. Ray.

960
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:39,466
Ray. Ray. Ray!

961
01:29:39,792 --> 01:29:41,224
Ray!

962
01:29:41,501 --> 01:29:44,219
Keep your voice down. Quiet!

963
01:30:25,785 --> 01:30:28,344
Not my blood. Not my blood.

964
01:30:31,456 --> 01:30:33,287
Not my blood.

965
01:30:34,376 --> 01:30:36,286
Not my...

966
01:30:36,752 --> 01:30:38,151
Not...

967
01:30:39,338 --> 01:30:40,611
...my...

968
01:30:42,924 --> 01:30:44,675
Not my blood.

969
01:30:45,509 --> 01:30:46,828
Not my blood.

970
01:30:47,094 --> 01:30:48,572
Not my blood.

971
01:30:48,845 --> 01:30:50,119
Not my blood.

972
01:30:50,681 --> 01:30:52,000
Not my blood.

973
01:30:52,266 --> 01:30:53,744
- Not my blood.
- Stop it.

974
01:30:54,016 --> 01:30:55,449
- Stop it.
- Not my blood.

975
01:30:55,727 --> 01:30:56,876
- Stop it.
- Not my blood.

976
01:30:57,145 --> 01:30:58,577
You gotta be quiet.

977
01:30:58,854 --> 01:31:00,806
- You want them to hear you?
- They drink us.

978
01:31:00,898 --> 01:31:02,694
- Please, they'll hear you.
- They drink us.

979
01:31:02,982 --> 01:31:05,735
Then they spray us, like fertilizer.

980
01:31:06,069 --> 01:31:07,262
You gotta be quiet.

981
01:31:07,528 --> 01:31:10,122
- Drink us, and...
- They're gonna come back down here.

982
01:31:10,447 --> 01:31:12,679
Then they spit us out all over
the goddamn red weeds.

983
01:31:13,613 --> 01:31:15,531
Do you understand
what I'm gonna have to do?

984
01:31:15,615 --> 01:31:17,452
I can't let my daughter die
because of you.

985
01:31:17,533 --> 01:31:19,364
This tunnel will get us to the city.

986
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:21,251
We'll have tunnels there.
Ready-made.

987
01:31:21,536 --> 01:31:23,215
- Stop it.
- Subway. See what I'm saying?

988
01:31:23,244 --> 01:31:24,772
- Hide an army down there.
- Stop it.

989
01:31:24,790 --> 01:31:26,568
We'll go underground.
Sneak attacks at night.

990
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:27,993
You stop it!

991
01:31:29,918 --> 01:31:32,876
We're the resistance, Ray.
They can't occupy this country.

992
01:31:33,213 --> 01:31:36,443
Occupations always fail. History's
taught us that a thousand times.

993
01:31:36,799 --> 01:31:38,993
This is our land.

994
01:31:39,301 --> 01:31:42,338
We eat it, we breathe it,
only we can live on it.

995
01:31:42,679 --> 01:31:45,317
They can't survive here, Ray.
They weren't built for it.

996
01:31:46,683 --> 01:31:48,718
They're gonna kill you, brother,
not me!

997
01:31:49,017 --> 01:31:51,326
- What are you doing, Dad?
- Not my blood!

998
01:31:51,645 --> 01:31:54,635
Whatever you hear,
don't take this off.

999
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:56,379
- Dad?
- Rach?

1000
01:31:56,648 --> 01:31:58,877
- Dad?
- What was that song?

1001
01:31:59,192 --> 01:32:02,581
- That lullaby that I didn't know?
- Not my blood!

1002
01:32:02,945 --> 01:32:04,663
- "Hushabye Mountain"?
- Yeah, sing it.

1003
01:32:04,947 --> 01:32:07,585
- They can take you!
- Please, Rach, sing it.

1004
01:32:07,907 --> 01:32:10,944
<i>- They can take you!
- A gentle breeze</i>

1005
01:32:11,285 --> 01:32:12,764
- Your daughter!
- Don't stop.

1006
01:32:13,037 --> 01:32:15,391
<i>- Not me!
- On Hushabye Mountain</i>

1007
01:32:15,704 --> 01:32:17,417
- They're gonna kill you!
- That's my girl.

1008
01:32:17,498 --> 01:32:21,888
<i>Softly blows over Lullaby Bay</i>

1009
01:32:22,585 --> 01:32:26,702
<i>- Forget it! Tunnel!
- It fills the sails</i>

1010
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,353
<i>Of boats that are waiting</i>

1011
01:32:32,177 --> 01:32:36,851
<i>Waiting to sail
Your worries away</i>

1012
01:32:38,973 --> 01:32:45,730
<i>So close your eyes
On Hushabye Mountain</i>

1013
01:32:47,147 --> 01:32:51,458
<i>Wave goodbye
To cares of the day</i>

1014
01:32:52,359 --> 01:32:57,273
<i>And watch your boat
From Hushabye Mountain</i>

1015
01:32:57,697 --> 01:33:03,407
<i>Sail far away
From Lullaby Bay</i>

1016
01:34:56,164 --> 01:34:57,677
Rachel?

1017
01:34:58,250 --> 01:34:59,763
Rachel?

1018
01:35:00,544 --> 01:35:02,374
Oh, my God, no.

1019
01:35:05,964 --> 01:35:07,397
Rachel?

1020
01:35:07,674 --> 01:35:09,153
Rachel? Rachel?

1021
01:35:20,476 --> 01:35:22,910
Rachel? Make some noise, baby.

1022
01:35:23,228 --> 01:35:24,216
Rachel?

1023
01:35:26,063 --> 01:35:27,781
Rachel?

1024
01:35:32,317 --> 01:35:34,955
Rachel? Talk to me, baby. Come on.

1025
01:35:38,822 --> 01:35:40,699
Rachel?

1026
01:35:43,534 --> 01:35:45,525
Rachel?

1027
01:35:59,339 --> 01:36:01,135
Rachel?

1028
01:36:01,424 --> 01:36:03,142
Rachel!

1029
01:37:09,978 --> 01:37:11,889
No, no, no!

1030
01:37:12,230 --> 01:37:13,582
No!

1031
01:37:44,462 --> 01:37:46,372
Hey!

1032
01:38:25,621 --> 01:38:27,576
Help!

1033
01:38:29,666 --> 01:38:32,383
What is happening?

1034
01:38:35,044 --> 01:38:36,033
Rachel!

1035
01:39:07,946 --> 01:39:09,617
Rachel.

1036
01:39:09,905 --> 01:39:12,702
Rachel. Rachel.

1037
01:39:13,533 --> 01:39:15,364
Rachel.

1038
01:39:16,661 --> 01:39:18,537
Rachel?

1039
01:39:19,747 --> 01:39:21,465
Rachel.

1040
01:39:22,415 --> 01:39:23,370
Dad.

1041
01:39:50,686 --> 01:39:52,244
No!

1042
01:39:53,356 --> 01:39:55,823
Pull me! Pull me!

1043
01:40:02,697 --> 01:40:05,051
Pull! Pull!

1044
01:40:05,365 --> 01:40:07,832
Pull me! Come on, pull!

1045
01:40:11,287 --> 01:40:13,641
- Dad!
- One, two, three!

1046
01:40:13,956 --> 01:40:17,152
We got him! Keep pulling!

1047
01:40:24,465 --> 01:40:26,932
Everybody down!

1048
01:41:19,549 --> 01:41:20,982
Keep it moving, folks.

1049
01:41:24,136 --> 01:41:26,410
Keep going, sir. Keep moving.

1050
01:41:26,721 --> 01:41:29,110
I don't know what's going on.

1051
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:32,931
Hold Grandma's hand.

1052
01:41:35,103 --> 01:41:38,413
Let's go, folks.
Keep moving forward.

1053
01:41:48,822 --> 01:41:50,494
Put that down.

1054
01:41:53,076 --> 01:41:55,794
Right this way, ma'am.
Right this way, thank you.

1055
01:42:04,041 --> 01:42:06,838
To the left, there, ma'am,
just to your left. Thank you.

1056
01:42:09,087 --> 01:42:11,078
What happened to it?

1057
01:42:15,259 --> 01:42:16,691
It's dying.

1058
01:42:19,262 --> 01:42:20,853
Keep moving forward.

1059
01:42:31,481 --> 01:42:32,834
Keep moving, it's all right!

1060
01:42:33,107 --> 01:42:34,698
You can pass on through.
Move along!

1061
01:42:34,883 --> 01:42:36,411
- What happened here?
- I don't know.

1062
01:42:36,435 --> 01:42:38,532
Something's happening to them.
Please, keep moving.

1063
01:42:38,570 --> 01:42:40,202
- Let's go, move out.
- Let's go, people.

1064
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:43,237
- Something's happening to them?
- Go. Go, just keep moving, sir.

1065
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:46,206
Let's go, sir. Let's go. Do not stop.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

1066
01:42:46,325 --> 01:42:48,694
Excuse me. What's happened here?
Did you guys take it down?

1067
01:42:48,701 --> 01:42:50,971
No, sir, it was behaving erratically,
walking in circles,

1068
01:42:51,079 --> 01:42:53,030
then it went down on its own
about an hour ago.

1069
01:42:53,121 --> 01:42:55,760
Now, please, let's go! Let's go!
Keep moving! Come on! Don't stop!

1070
01:42:56,083 --> 01:42:58,038
Do not stop! Let's go! Thank you!

1071
01:42:59,627 --> 01:43:01,424
How is it dead all by itself?

1072
01:43:01,713 --> 01:43:04,101
- Rachel, I'm not sure.
- Coming through.

1073
01:43:04,423 --> 01:43:07,334
Coming through. Make a hole.
Coming through.

1074
01:43:27,441 --> 01:43:29,556
Calm down.
Calm down and get in the tunnel.

1075
01:43:29,859 --> 01:43:32,851
Calm down and get in the tunnel.
Calm down and get in the tunnel.

1076
01:43:45,206 --> 01:43:47,673
Everybody calm down.
Get in the tunnel.

1077
01:43:47,998 --> 01:43:50,387
- On the other side of the tracks!
- Hey! Hey!

1078
01:43:54,212 --> 01:43:55,691
Look at the birds!

1079
01:43:55,964 --> 01:43:57,442
I can't hear you!

1080
01:43:57,715 --> 01:44:00,388
Look at the goddamn birds!

1081
01:44:03,387 --> 01:44:05,662
- No shield!
- I can't hear!

1082
01:44:05,973 --> 01:44:07,690
No shield!

1083
01:44:11,558 --> 01:44:13,708
The Javelin's the key!

1084
01:44:14,019 --> 01:44:16,657
Load the Gustav!
It's gonna be a tough kill!

1085
01:44:16,979 --> 01:44:17,968
Let's go!

1086
01:44:20,523 --> 01:44:21,638
It's safer in here.

1087
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:23,652
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1088
01:44:23,944 --> 01:44:25,456
Bring out the Javelin!

1089
01:44:34,076 --> 01:44:36,271
Clear! Get from behind! Clear!

1090
01:44:45,587 --> 01:44:47,816
- Let me know when you're tracking!
- Tracking!

1091
01:44:48,130 --> 01:44:49,643
- You got a lock?
- I got a lock!

1092
01:44:49,923 --> 01:44:51,514
Fire the Javelin!

1093
01:44:58,387 --> 01:45:00,617
- I got a lock!
- Fire the Javelin!

1094
01:45:03,933 --> 01:45:05,286
Fire!

1095
01:45:19,779 --> 01:45:21,451
It's okay.

1096
01:45:22,741 --> 01:45:24,492
I love you.

1097
01:45:24,783 --> 01:45:27,297
- It's okay. You're gonna be okay.
- Let's go!

1098
01:45:28,828 --> 01:45:30,819
Keep those civilians out of there.

1099
01:45:31,122 --> 01:45:34,796
Back. Stay back!
Come on, folks, back up!

1100
01:45:40,004 --> 01:45:43,075
Come on, guys, get on the line.
Get up there now.

1101
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:46,593
Stay back. Stay right here, huh?
Hold on right there.

1102
01:45:52,514 --> 01:45:55,152
- It's opening.
- It's opening. Keep them back.

1103
01:46:34,588 --> 01:46:36,101
Clear!

1104
01:46:36,381 --> 01:46:39,611
No, keep them back, keep them back.
Come on, stay back.

1105
01:47:15,244 --> 01:47:17,121
Mom!

1106
01:47:43,977 --> 01:47:46,091
Thank you.

1107
01:48:09,245 --> 01:48:10,917
- Robbie?
- Robbie?

1108
01:48:17,545 --> 01:48:19,455
Hi, Dad.

1109
01:48:20,088 --> 01:48:21,680
Hi, Dad.

1110
01:48:22,507 --> 01:48:24,098
Hi, Dad.

1111
01:48:58,619 --> 01:49:00,813
<i>From the moment
the invaders arrived,</i>

1112
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:04,349
<i>breathed our air, ate and drank,</i>

1113
01:49:04,705 --> 01:49:06,297
<i>they were doomed.</i>

1114
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:10,446
<i>They were undone, destroyed,</i>

1115
01:49:10,794 --> 01:49:13,909
<i>after all of man's weapons
and devices had failed,</i>

1116
01:49:14,254 --> 01:49:19,008
<i>by the tiniest creatures that God
in his wisdom put upon this Earth.</i>

1117
01:49:20,343 --> 01:49:23,778
<i>By the toll of a billion deaths,
man had earned his immunity,</i>

1118
01:49:24,137 --> 01:49:28,493
<i>his right to survive among
this planet's infinite organisms.</i>

1119
01:49:29,976 --> 01:49:33,490
<i>And that right is ours
against all challenges,</i>

1120
01:49:33,854 --> 01:49:39,530
<i>for neither do men live,
nor die, in vain.</i>

1121
