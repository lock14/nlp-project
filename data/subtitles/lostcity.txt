1
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,515
Giddy-up! We're almost home.

2
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,435
All right. Tomatoes.

3
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,312
There you go. OK, boys.

4
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,919
Pull!

5
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,920
How's that?

6
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,075
Try some tomatoes.

7
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,832
Here we go. Ready?

8
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,475
Got 'em! Pretty good, huh? Thanks, guys.

9
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,913
Uh-oh.

10
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,395
Man your battle stations, boys.

11
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,079
Whoa!

12
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:18,156
Welcome home.

13
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,475
- I got it! I got it!
- What did you get?

14
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:26,433
- Come on, I'll show you. Come on.
- Well, let's go then.

15
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,274
So what's the occasion?
Come on. Let me see. Let me see!

16
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,354
Come on, open it.

17
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,913
God, you're gonna love this.

18
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,550
Oh, I hope you like it.

19
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:48,393
- It's a suit.
- Right, a suit.

20
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,752
- You hate it, don't you?
- No, but I could learn to.

21
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,349
You could learn to like it too.
You can't dress like that in America.

22
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,913
Another good reason
not to go to America. Huh?

23
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,793
You're not suckering me
into that argument again.

24
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,753
I'm not getting married here and spending
my honeymoon swinging from vines

25
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,917
and checking the bed for snakes.

26
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,271
Those weren't the only things
I had planned.

27
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,197
Jesse.

28
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,192
- Come on out and show us.
- Not on your life.

29
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,153
Which, by the way,
this suit has put in serious jeopardy.

30
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,514
- You look great.
- I look ridiculous.

31
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,711
I can't breathe. This thing is dangerous.

32
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,319
Come on. Come on.

33
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,110
Ask them how you look. They'll be honest.

34
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,391
OK, boys. How do I look?

35
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:28,637
That's it. That clinches it.

36
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,716
Dumont!

37
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,920
- Dumont!
- Agon.

38
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,031
- They follow... Quatermain.
- Don't try to talk.

39
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:41,356
I'm here. We'll take care of you.

40
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,391
Damn!

41
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,389
- Get him in the house.
- Quatermain!

42
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,949
Quatermain, no!

43
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,199
Quatermain.
Quatermain, are you hurt? Are?

44
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:25,276
Your suit.

45
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,355
I'm fine, thanks.

46
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,389
Quatermain, is that you?

47
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,110
I'm right here. Right here.

48
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,629
Incredible, Q.

49
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:57,752
I had to get out. Incredible.

50
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,875
Gold.

51
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,514
Streets of it.

52
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:06,074
Swarma. He's...

53
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,713
See Swarma. He...

54
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:11,235
See Swarma.

55
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,076
I wanna know if my brother is still alive.

56
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,394
Robeson. He's...

57
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,589
Robeson.

58
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,393
- Please, try!
- Not our fault.

59
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:29,432
Didn't know. Didn't know.

60
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,073
Don't want to die.

61
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,509
No! No!

62
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,398
No!

63
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,720
Come on. Just let him be now.

64
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,875
He's asleep now.

65
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,990
I'm sure after he gets some rest
he'll be able to tell you about your brother.

66
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,638
Those men he was muttering about -
Hudson and Tremont. Who are they?

67
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,436
Old friends. They thought about adventure
first and the danger second.

68
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,438
Always ready to go out
at the drop of a legend.

69
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:29,552
They left while we were
at King Solomon's Mines.

70
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:35,515
They were searching for a great lost city,
a lost white race.

71
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:38,472
My brother pestered me about it for years.

72
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,716
It was a crazy idea and I told him.

73
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,390
Too damn dangerous chasing after
just another improbable African myth.

74
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,514
- I guess he got tired of pestering me.
- Do you think he found it?

75
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,192
They found something,
or something found them.

76
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,834
You're the resident archaeologist.

77
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,519
What do you make of this?

78
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:02,197
It's gold.

79
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,956
Possibly commemorative.

80
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:15,317
The inscription here,
it looks Phoenician, or a variation.

81
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,236
Phoenician?

82
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,114
I've never seen anything quite like it.
Where'd you get it?

83
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,754
It was in Dumont's things. And this knife.

84
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,357
What do you think?

85
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,076
Very strange.

86
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,634
The sun symbol is definitely Egyptian.

87
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,475
But the graphics are Phoenician.

88
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:48,678
And the detail is very advanced.

89
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,875
It just doesn't make any sense.

90
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,959
The man who attacked me wore a band
with this symbol on it.

91
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,676
They found something.

92
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,476
Oh, the devil! The devil's been here!

93
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:14,791
One thing's for sure -
the fever didn't kill him.

94
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,797
Quatermain! Hey, Quatermain!

95
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:31,309
- Not today, trader.
- Some fine pots, Quatermain.

96
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,000
You can never have enough fine pots.

97
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,037
- I don't think so.
- Oh, please, Quatermain.

98
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,956
Come on. Business can't be that bad.

99
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,273
Trader.

100
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:48,596
Trader, I'll, uh... I'll buy it. I'll buy the pot.

101
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,676
Trader.

102
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,990
What a wonderful fabric, eh, Quatermain?

103
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,828
Woven by the finest English craftsmen.
It fits like skin.

104
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,315
Not a nice trick, trader.
Where'd you get it?

105
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,717
From some Lamu tribesmen who,
as you know, are most fond of beheading.

106
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,355
I fear the men who wore them
were not so well-served by the shirts.

107
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,232
A costly oversight by the tailor.

108
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,634
Wait, Quatermain. You must buy
the shirt. It will save your life.

109
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:23,355
Four of them, Quatermain,
for five kilos of ham and four hides.

110
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,552
- Simply avoid the Lamu.
- I'll buy the shirt if I get some information.

111
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,557
- I'm looking for a man called Swarma.
- Ah, Swarma.

112
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:34,467
Knows all, sees all, tells all - for a price.

113
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,677
Perhaps he's in there
on such a hot and dusty day.

114
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,076
- I have no need of your goods.
- But you have need for my information.

115
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,155
Quatermain comes looking for you.

116
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,067
About a man who died, and a coin.
If you wish to know more...

117
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,713
One of my followers
has brought me this news.

118
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,149
What can I say? It's a small town.

119
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,634
Possibly you have more details.

120
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:33,514
A friend of Quatermain stumbled into
his yard with tales of a lost city of gold.

121
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,836
He uttered your name before he died,
killed in his bed.

122
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:41,315
- Quick.
- But my pay?

123
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,351
Yes, yes, here. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

124
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,231
Swarma.

125
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,955
Come in. Come in, sir.

126
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,794
Have you ever seen one of these before?

127
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:10,150
It is a coin.

128
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,229
Very good.

129
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,034
A coin of gold.
I told your brother of such a coin, sir.

130
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:22,316
It belonged to Reverend Mackenzie and
has a history that we can only dream of.

131
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,750
- How did Mackenzie get it?
- Three years ago, sir,

132
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:30,395
a man fell in his doorway
with great fever and many itches.

133
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:32,669
He had such a coin,

134
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:38,830
and he spoke of a city far beyond
Lekanisera, lost in the mountains,

135
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,149
with streets and roofs of gold,

136
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:48,477
ruled by a lost white race.
Fever talk, perhaps.

137
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,149
- Then my friend had the same fever.
- He saw these streets of gold?

138
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:55,669
So he said. Did you tell my brother
how to find this lost city?

139
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:59,269
I told him what I knew.
Find the wall of Jalpora.

140
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:03,278
Pay heed to its secrets.
Seek the Devil's Heart.

141
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:05,754
Watch for signs.

142
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:10,077
- Sounds like helpful travel tips.
- Will you too search for this city of gold?

143
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,592
I'll search for my family and friends.
This lost civilisation can keep its gold.

144
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,475
Kiba, catch.

145
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:34,073
Hi.

146
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:44,869
You had better hurry because we are not
missing that boat and you haven't packed.

147
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,470
I know I haven't,
and there's a good reason.

148
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,556
I'm not going.

149
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,879
My brother still may be out there.
I've gotta look for him.

150
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,551
- But where? Where do you start?
- I found Swarma. He told me. Sort of.

151
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,393
Quatermain.

152
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:11,272
We have planned this trip for six months.

153
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,711
My parents have planned it. They've sent
invitations. We've arranged catering.

154
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,910
You're worrying about hors d'oeuvres?

155
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,394
Now, that's not fair.

156
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,836
Well, when do we think about us?

157
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,669
We're talking about my brother
and my best friends.

158
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,357
What am I?

159
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,596
Look, they've been gone so long...
and after what's happened here, it's...

160
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,837
- It's dangerous and it's crazy.
- And it's what I've gotta do.

161
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,592
Fine.

162
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,393
And going to America is what I have to do.

163
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,916
I just don't think I'm being unreasonable.

164
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,712
Do you think I'm being unreasonable?

165
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,479
Of course I'm not being unreasonable.

166
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:15,910
A relationship is give-and-take.

167
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:18,394
I feel like I'm doing all the giving.

168
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:20,828
You know what I mean, George?

169
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,631
What do you think, George?

170
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:26,829
I think I should drive, madam.

171
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,999
The rumours say, Mackenzie,
that we travel east past Lekanisera.

172
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,032
The ruins of Jalpora are supposed to lie
between here and the Tana river.

173
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,631
That's just the problem, Quatermain.
Too many rumours and not enough facts.

174
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:46,709
Ah, hell, Dutchman. Half of Africa's been
explored on rumour, hope and legend.

175
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:47,989
Yes.

176
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:50,111
And blood.

177
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,914
Too many people going off into
unexplored Africa and not coming back.

178
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:56,348
I outfitted your brother's group last year.

179
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,268
- The last I'll see of that equipment.
- I wouldn't bet my lungs on that.

180
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,551
I'm gonna put a party together,
one way or the other, or I go alone.

181
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,398
You'll do it, too, won't you?

182
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,829
Not knowing where you're going,
and getting lost as hell.

183
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,588
All right, let's go see
if we can buy you some help.

184
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,869
Sure, we've been planning
this trip for months.

185
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,513
OK, so that's one against him.

186
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,759
But after all, isn't his concern for his
family and his friends part of his appeal?

187
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,836
Oh, hell, George.

188
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,993
He needs me. As a matter of fact
he can't live without me.

189
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,310
Whee!

190
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,551
Yahoo!

191
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,188
How would you like to go
on an expedition to East Africa?

192
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,628
Yeah, East Africa. You'll love it.

193
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,636
We leave tomorrow.

194
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:14,715
Maybe next time.

195
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,708
I figure you can choose
between the Wamusas, who'll rob you,

196
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:26,150
Tumatas, who'll desert you,

197
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:28,588
or the Mapaki, who'll eat you.

198
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,116
With all this going for me,
who needs to worry about getting lost?

199
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:44,030
Ah, mighty chief.

200
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,188
Slayer of elephants, eater-up of lions,
clever one, watchful one,

201
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:53,232
brave one, quick one,
whose shot never misses.

202
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:57,353
Grasp a hand and hold it
to the death. Quatermain.

203
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,357
That's me, all right.

204
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,310
Am I a stranger now?

205
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,394
Yah!

206
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,798
Umslopogaas. And Groanmaker.

207
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:21,796
Hey, that's OK. I get the idea.
I'm glad to see you too.

208
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,036
You're a long way from home, aren't you?

209
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,518
I who am highborn, ay,
of the blood of a great king - a chief.

210
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,351
I am a wanderer. A man without a kraal,
with nought save my axe.

211
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:38,951
And you, Quatermain, why are you here?

212
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:43,556
I'm trying to put together a party
to go into East Africa,

213
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,193
but everybody but me is too smart to go.

214
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:48,674
They live and breathe fear. Not I.

215
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,872
Let the blow come quickly
and the blood run red.

216
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,993
I travel with five Askari
over whom I hold much influence.

217
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:59,713
- You have your party.
- Ah.

218
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,432
Quatermain.

219
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,119
Careful there.
That one's got a bloodthirst.

220
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,631
He also has five Askari
over whom he holds much influence.

221
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,836
Thank you.

222
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,955
Well, well, well.

223
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,034
Your image has haunted me, sir, and that
of your brother and the friends you seek.

224
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:55,190
I could not rest easy were I to let you
embark on a journey of such peril alone,

225
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:59,153
when it is I who possess
the legend's secrets.

226
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:02,998
- I guess that means you wanna come.
- No, no, no.

227
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,829
I don't want to come, but, sir,
it is a journey through legend,

228
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,909
shrouded in mystery, which I,
as your humble guide, will unravel.

229
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,156
Gee, and I thought it was just a trek
into unexplored Africa.

230
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,868
Sir, a mystic experience awaits us.

231
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,557
- Oh, no, it can't be.
- Yes.

232
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,633
I recognise that scream.

233
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,028
Attack! Attack!

234
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,271
Hey, good-lookin'.

235
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,872
Quatermain!

236
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,555
Did you make a wrong turn?
America's about 6,000 miles that way.

237
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,958
- I'm glad to see you, too, Quatermain.
- I'm glad, just surprised.

238
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,038
We can always go to America.
We can always get married.

239
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,151
- Yeah.
- Right now I should be with you.

240
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,952
I want you to come
but you said it's too dangerous.

241
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:04,869
- You can't get rid of me with a lecture.
- I don't want you to get hurt.

242
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,753
I'm not gonna sit around worrying if
I'm gonna be a widow before I'm a bride.

243
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,440
- Jesse.
- Please, you can't ask me to do that.

244
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:14,996
- Jesse.
- I won't listen. You see? I'm not listening.

245
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,713
The walls of Jalpora.

246
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:29,990
Nice work. For a while I thought
we'd end up in Cleveland.

247
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:33,156
Proof that only a fool questions
the wisdom of Swarma.

248
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,353
Proof that even a blind monkey
sometimes finds a banana.

249
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,231
Wait.

250
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,278
The guardians of Jalpora.

251
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,960
- Rough neighbourhood.
- Yeah.

252
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:33,832
Perhaps I should wait here.
Meditate on our journey.

253
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:46,038
It is the stirring of restless souls.

254
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,195
What purpose do these walls serve?

255
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:50,276
Religious, possibly?

256
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,435
They don't belong here.

257
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:56,518
These stones are 3,000 miles from home.

258
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,436
- Gold.
- Gold?

259
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,473
A golden sun setting on a river.
A fiery river.

260
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,996
Did someone say "gold"?

261
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:20,270
- Is there a river near here?
- The Tana.

262
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,759
Maybe we follow the river to a golden sun.

263
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,633
Or to a golden city.

264
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,357
I think we're starting
to piss off somebody's god.

265
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,076
- Oh, my God.
- No!

266
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,155
It's Hudson.

267
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:22,951
This is it, isn't it?
We're gonna die now.

268
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:26,435
Please, the stone! Shove back the stone!

269
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,198
Shove back the stone!

270
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,357
Your legs! Your legs! Oh, God! Oh!

271
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,516
Oh, God.

272
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,596
You all right?

273
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:45,029
The legend, of course, warned of this -

274
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,310
the ground devouring intruders.

275
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,954
The golden orb tempting the Fates.

276
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:55,880
So it comes to pass.

277
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,308
What's that?

278
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,357
- An Eshowe.
- War dress.

279
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,913
Yeah.

280
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,749
That doesn't sound too friendly.

281
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,714
It was friendly all right. He wants you
in exchange for using his river.

282
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:31,148
Can't we strike some other arrangement?

283
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,634
I'm sure going to try.

284
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,829
Please, must you upset him?

285
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,909
Umslopogaas can't understand
why he prefers you to the tea kettle.

286
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:27,516
Oh, my God.

287
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,954
- So, it was, I hope, a friendly parting?
- He hopes we enjoyed our last sunset.

288
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:40,789
- So what do we do now? Turn back?
- Too late for that.

289
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,309
We go as far as we can,
then sleep in the canoe.

290
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,389
The Eshowe are territorial.
We just try to get out of their territory.

291
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,916
Swarma, row. Jesse, reload.

292
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,273
Try putting it in the water.

293
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,472
Madam, I am a man of peace,
a man of prayer.

294
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,672
Good. Then pray you don't
have to use this.

295
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,199
Why?

296
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,076
Oh, no! Please!

297
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,757
Please!

298
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,280
Do you think we passed them?

299
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:07,076
Not quite.

300
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:48,115
Oh, my God.

301
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:58,514
Swarma! The dynamite!

302
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,192
Oh!

303
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:17,873
The dynamite! Quick!

304
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,869
- Duva! Duva!
- What is it?

305
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,594
The spear didn't harm me
so they think I'm a devil.

306
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:31,155
- Duva! Duva!
- Come on.

307
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,829
Duva! Duva!

308
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,110
- Do you think they've given up?
- For now, anyway.

309
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:30,516
Depends on how long
they're scared of the devil.

310
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:32,311
Look!

311
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,876
Hold on!

312
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,793
Oh, I have died.

313
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,114
I have died.

314
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:23,789
Why did I not heed the legends
about this rotten trip?

315
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,628
Have I entered into the shadows
with this whimpering wretch?

316
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,070
I hate to disappoint you guys,
but I think we're still alive.

317
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:34,077
And we've lost another Askari.

318
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:12,472
- Feel the heat.
- We enter the Devil's Heart.

319
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:15,432
Thanks for the words of encouragement.

320
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:19,074
The water's hot too.
Are we going into a volcano?

321
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:22,317
No, just the Devil's Heart.

322
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:40,393
Quatermain, what are we gonna do?

323
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,398
Back-paddle.

324
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:06,476
To the right.

325
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,954
Pull.

326
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,275
On the right.

327
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,635
This could be it.

328
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,318
Great.

329
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:34,237
Sorry.

330
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:38,717
Where are we?

331
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:44,597
The river must have tossed us off
into an antechamber. Where exactly?

332
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:49,675
- How are you?
- Oh, I don't know. Ouch.

333
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:52,996
- Fine.
- Yeah?

334
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,273
- What do we do now?
- We're a little vague on that.

335
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,960
Swarma's run out of legend.

336
00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:16,829
I found some markings here
that might help.

337
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,190
They're eroded but these look
like a native dialect

338
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,436
and there's some French
around the corner here. There.

339
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:25,516
And these.

340
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,632
- It's Phoenician.
- What does it say?

341
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,235
"Phoenicians speak of a golden temple."

342
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,353
Jesse! Can you hear me?
Are you all right?

343
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,634
Of course I'm not all right!
I just got sucked down this damn hole.

344
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,715
She's all right.

345
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:59,108
Jesse, take this lantern, see where you are
and tie the rope around your waist.

346
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:01,389
I know where I am.

347
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:04,079
Just get me out of here.

348
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,197
Gold! There's gold blocks down here.

349
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:18,438
Perhaps I should go down and help her.
Gold could be very heavy.

350
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,632
What's goin' on? Are you all right?

351
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:33,516
- I'm coming down, honey.
- There's a bunch of dead people here!

352
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:47,516
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, we're all right.

353
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:52,030
More than I can say for the rest of 'em.
It's a graveyard down here.

354
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,717
Oh, no.

355
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,030
- It's not your?
- No, no. It's Tremont.

356
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,039
We just have to keep hoping.

357
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:07,717
This kind of death goes hand in hand
with our kind of life.

358
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,195
It's the price we pay
for living a great adventure.

359
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,159
OK.

360
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,235
Pull her up.

361
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,835
What's goin' on up there?

362
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:18,793
Quatermain, come on! Come on.

363
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,233
Let's get outta here. Quick.

364
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,318
You don't need to ask me twice.

365
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:36,793
Maybe this tunnel goes under
the lost city and keeps right on going.

366
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,309
Or maybe it stops right here.

367
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,715
Stand back.

368
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,188
- There's no other choice.
- Quatermain!

369
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:56,750
- I don't wanna do this.
- Jump. You can make it.

370
00:49:18,199 --> 00:49:19,679
Uh!

371
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,835
Come on, Swarma.

372
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:53,311
Never in my life have I been so tempted.

373
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,315
- It's getting hot in here.
- We must be near the volcanos.

374
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,634
I hear breathing.

375
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,715
I don't hear anything.

376
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,275
Flatten yourselves against the wall.
Take this.

377
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:14,958
- It feels like we're going uphill.
- Whole trip's felt that way.

378
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,708
The air is cooler, fresher.

379
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,637
It's coming from up ahead.

380
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,431
- Please, do not do that.
- What?

381
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:31,710
Brush against my face.

382
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,920
You can bet your last turban
it wasn't me, pal.

383
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:40,438
Me neither. The breeze is getting stronger.
Jesse, light one of the matches.

384
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,309
Well...

385
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,476
Well done.

386
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:07,351
Look! The Lost City of Gold! It exists!

387
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:15,393
I've seen some amazing things in my life
but never anything to compare with this.

388
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,916
I sure hope Robeson's inside.

389
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:50,269
Swarma's praying the natives are friendly.

390
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,914
Mackenzie was right
about the legend of the lost city.

391
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:56,998
I wonder if he was right
about the lost race.

392
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:02,152
Slow down, Quatermain.
Wait for me.

393
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,840
Come on, Swarma.

394
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,268
- This is incredible.
- Just look at those doors.

395
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,632
- Prideful people.
- And a little ostentatious.

396
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,309
Look.

397
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:38,275
The white race does exist.

398
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,313
Each discovery gives truth to the legend.
I amaze myself.

399
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:46,353
Wait. They may not be as enthusiastic
as we are. I'll go check it out.

400
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,436
- With Swarma.
- Me?

401
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:51,079
But...

402
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,751
A magnificent display of courage.

403
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:32,476
I did not interfere because I did not wish
to intrude on such heroism.

404
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:33,952
Oh, no!

405
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:42,108
Look! Do you see what your stupid act of
barbarism has done? We're dead for sure.

406
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:46,199
- Well, they seem friendly.
- Yeah.

407
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:25,429
- They're so trusting and friendly.
- They haven't met Swarma yet.

408
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,235
For us?

409
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:43,635
Mm. Mm!

410
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,797
- Heavy.
- Allan!

411
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,391
Allan!

412
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:01,518
Robeson.

413
00:57:01,639 --> 00:57:04,108
- Hey, little brother!
- Hey!

414
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:06,548
- God!
- God!

415
00:57:06,679 --> 00:57:11,117
I can't believe it. You're here. Dumont
got through. What are you doing here?

416
00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:15,152
We were in the neighbourhood.
I thought I'd drop by. What do you mean?

417
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,429
Excuse me. Hi.

418
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:20,791
I'm Jesse Huston, and this
could have been our honeymoon.

419
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,559
- What?
- Umslopogaas, the great warrior.

420
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:26,193
Gold, you see. Gold everywhere.

421
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:30,632
And no weapons. You'd think with all
the gold they'd be armed, but they're not.

422
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:36,710
It's wonderful just to see...
to... to see such peace.

423
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:40,548
Such tranquility does the soul
of a holy man good.

424
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:45,434
- Swarma's our spiritual leader.
- The man is a useless hollow reed.

425
00:57:45,559 --> 00:57:47,675
May I slay him?

426
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:48,869
Come.

427
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:57,949
I told you your Japanese
would come in handy.

428
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:02,949
I told them you were my brother.
So, how are you? And Dumont, how's he?

429
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:06,594
I'm fine. He's dead. I'm glad you're OK.

430
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,070
Except for that guy, you'll like it here.

431
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,952
- What's going on?
- That's Agon, the high priest.

432
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:26,355
He says you committed a sacrilege.

433
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,391
- We just got here.
- You killed a lion, the sacred beast.

434
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:32,318
Saved a child
from being eaten, you mean.

435
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:48,190
No. Go with them.

436
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,992
Boy, first impressions
sure can be deceiving.

437
00:58:56,119 --> 00:58:59,271
Just when I was starting
to like these people.

438
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:37,436
Please, must you offend everyone?

439
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:44,117
Sorais.

440
00:59:47,719 --> 00:59:52,713
Sorais. She and her sister Nyleptha
share the rule as queens.

441
01:00:00,679 --> 01:00:02,431
Nyleptha.

442
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:06,235
People love Nyleptha
but they're scared of Agon.

443
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:19,956
I am wary of people ruled by women

444
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:24,231
for, like women, they may quickly
change from friend to foe.

445
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:27,032
Careful.
I taught Nyleptha and Agon English.

446
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:32,313
Which one of you is going to die
for slaying our sacred beast?

447
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:38,757
Me?

448
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:40,878
But...

449
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:49,235
I am like the venerable Agon - a priest.

450
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,516
A man who respects the beliefs of others.

451
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:57,358
I admire the venerable...

452
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:05,634
By all that is holy,
someone has sought to mock me.

453
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:10,833
It was the savage.

454
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:21,998
Believe me. He hid these things
in my garments to make me the fool.

455
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:25,112
You need no help from me to be the fool.

456
01:01:25,239 --> 01:01:30,711
And I will split your venerable head
if you speak more of sacrifice.

457
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:49,076
Hang on!

458
01:01:55,719 --> 01:01:58,393
Get me outta here!

459
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,148
Allan!

460
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,469
That was a neat trick. He says
you're some kind of god, or a devil.

461
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,952
- Are you gods or devils?
- Neither, Your Majesty.

462
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:07,913
We came to find my lost brother.

463
01:03:08,039 --> 01:03:09,996
Is he lost?

464
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:16,831
Forgive our rude welcome.

465
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:21,192
Agon is more interested in the power of
gold than in the great spirit of our temple.

466
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,516
You must be tired.
You must rest and refresh.

467
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,559
Go with them. They will assist you.

468
01:03:41,559 --> 01:03:44,027
By the way, Q.

469
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:47,708
- Nice shirt.
- Careful, kid. You'll blow my cover.

470
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,672
This was like paradise
until Agon showed up.

471
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,996
He was a slave trader from the north,
selling arms to the Eshowe.

472
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:51,032
- They brought him here.
- From slave trader to high priest?

473
01:04:51,159 --> 01:04:53,798
- How?
- By preying on the fears of the people.

474
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:57,434
He's created a cult of lion gods,
slavery, human sacrifice.

475
01:04:57,559 --> 01:04:58,913
And the gold?

476
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:02,315
Agon uses the Eshowe to smuggle it.
The smelter's underground.

477
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:06,956
- The punishment for going near is death.
- Robeson, why don't you leave with us?

478
01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:09,719
I'm in love with the people here.

479
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:14,990
- And Nyleptha's an enemy?
- She fights them.

480
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,193
Aris Tima.

481
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:22,117
- That means welcome in our language.
- Thank you, Majesty.

482
01:05:39,239 --> 01:05:40,797
Hello?

483
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,918
Hello?

484
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:46,400
What is going on here?

485
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,273
You admire the gold statue?

486
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:16,192
Quite a piece of art. Very realistic.

487
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:19,277
Of course. You met him in the temple.

488
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,994
A victim of Quatermain's magic.

489
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,039
He was a good guard.
Now, a beautiful statue.

490
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,628
You mean all these statues?

491
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:43,038
They used to sculpt them by hand.
But good art takes so long.

492
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:46,751
I make more efficient use of resources.

493
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,077
- I admire efficiency.
- And you admire the gold.

494
01:06:50,199 --> 01:06:51,996
Gold?

495
01:06:52,119 --> 01:06:54,269
Pity how it turns men to fools.

496
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,469
Ah, but you're so wise.

497
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:01,994
Well, I am a humble man
but, yes, yes, I am wise.

498
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:07,112
You know the secrets
of Quatermain's powers.

499
01:07:07,239 --> 01:07:10,391
Is he a god? Or a devil spirit?

500
01:07:10,519 --> 01:07:13,751
Quatermain?
Why, he is no more a god than I...

501
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:19,835
I mean, I am more a god.

502
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,916
Greater powers.

503
01:07:28,599 --> 01:07:30,750
Quatermain brings evil here.

504
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,838
Sorais is afraid that her sister
is too weak to stop it.

505
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,918
But if you teach us the secrets, we stop it.

506
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,436
Secrets for me...

507
01:07:46,519 --> 01:07:48,670
gold for you.

508
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:41,997
Oh!

509
01:08:47,159 --> 01:08:50,118
- How you doin'?
- You really like these people, don't you?

510
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:54,198
Look around, Q. These people have
lived together in peace for centuries.

511
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:56,595
Where can you find this
in the modern world?

512
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,676
Cleveland?

513
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:01,395
There you go.

514
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,398
They developed their amazing
way of life right here.

515
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:25,273
Oh, it's a lifetime's worth of study.

516
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,519
- Who's that?
- It's Nasta. He lives in the mountains

517
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:40,109
with a small army to protect
the city's only open border.

518
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:43,550
Looks like he came
to check out the competition.

519
01:09:56,439 --> 01:09:59,078
You want to be his breakfast?

520
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:49,278
How does somebody find out
they can do that?

521
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,756
Uh-oh.

522
01:10:58,199 --> 01:11:02,318
Looks like this could be
your big opportunity.

523
01:11:02,439 --> 01:11:04,395
Yeah?

524
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,828
Nah.

525
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:10,509
No. Slight headache.

526
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:07,747
Argh!

527
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:18,872
- Move everybody back.
- OK.

528
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:34,033
Abracadabra.

529
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:37,791
Abracadabra.

530
01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:40,993
Abracadabra.

531
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:48,354
Abracadabra.

532
01:12:49,359 --> 01:12:52,033
Oop-boop-be-do.

533
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,993
Aloha, belladonna.

534
01:12:55,119 --> 01:12:59,398
Oh, what a goose I am.

535
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,475
Shazam!

536
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:30,112
You have influence now.
If you wish to help us, it is the time.

537
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:56,038
I have told them you will destroy
the altar of sacrifice.

538
01:14:01,039 --> 01:14:04,998
Agon has placed it here
and only a god can remove it.

539
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:09,591
This is what you get for showing off.

540
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:13,997
As you destroyed the stone bench,
so can you destroy this.

541
01:14:14,119 --> 01:14:16,076
Sure.

542
01:14:18,279 --> 01:14:21,192
Any ideas?
I'm fresh out of dynamite.

543
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,119
Ta na reja.

544
01:15:15,159 --> 01:15:18,390
Say "Ta na reja".
It means "No more sacrifice".

545
01:15:19,079 --> 01:15:21,832
- Ta na reja!
- Ta na reja!

546
01:16:14,119 --> 01:16:18,796
There. Are you happy? This is no toy.

547
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:22,150
Magic. My magic.

548
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:27,435
I cannot work with this man.
He is impossible.

549
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:30,198
He does not listen. He is stupid.

550
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:32,435
And he smells.

551
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,832
- I will explain this to Nasta.
- But...

552
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:41,274
Possibly enthusiasm for battle.
Much to be admired.

553
01:16:41,399 --> 01:16:44,038
Much to be admired.

554
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,469
Much to be admired.

555
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,914
Much to be admired.

556
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:09,115
Please to warn him.
I'm overcome with anger.

557
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,832
He joins us in battle.

558
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:24,033
He's worried about the devil's magic,
but... I told him that you have stolen it.

559
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:26,354
That you are a friend.

560
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,630
- We're their last and only hope.
- We have to find a way to help them.

561
01:18:22,319 --> 01:18:25,789
- Where are the rest of the weapons?
- You're looking at 'em.

562
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:30,595
Brother, we better start thinkin'.
Do you have any heavier metals?

563
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:33,074
No, but we have gold.

564
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,833
I am a man of peace, not a warrior,
so if you will just pay me my gold,

565
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:45,591
and provide me my bearers, I will be
returning home to spread your teachings.

566
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:49,997
Tell that to our warriors
who wait for your guidance.

567
01:18:52,439 --> 01:18:56,956
Should I not stay behind and
guard against attack from the rear?

568
01:19:06,279 --> 01:19:09,317
Wow, with this much gold
we can make plenty of weapons.

569
01:19:09,439 --> 01:19:12,000
We can hold the city for weeks.

570
01:19:43,439 --> 01:19:47,034
OK, fellas, I know this stuff is heavy,
but move out.

571
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:17,592
Quick! Come on! Come on!

572
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:22,114
Half of you over there.
The other half come with me.

573
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:25,198
Up on the walls as quickly as you can.

574
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:44,434
- My God, it's the Eshowe.
- Now what do you want me to tell them?

575
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:47,996
- Look confident or the people will crack.
- Sure.

576
01:20:48,119 --> 01:20:50,792
As soon as my knees stop shaking.

577
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:16,676
I welcome you.

578
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,712
I welcome you.

579
01:21:21,119 --> 01:21:26,831
Who will first taste the sweet gift of steel?

580
01:22:07,319 --> 01:22:09,708
No, no, not yet.

581
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:12,676
OK, now!

582
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:22,314
Please, must you ruin that gold?

583
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,475
Hyah! Hyah!

584
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,715
Hah!

585
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:22,876
Duva! Duva!

586
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,789
- Hah!
- Duva! Duva!

587
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:54,036
Duva! Duva!

588
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:24,430
Robeson, get everyone off the walls
and get them into the temple.

589
01:24:44,199 --> 01:24:48,238
- I'll hold these stairs against them.
- We're in your hands.

590
01:24:48,359 --> 01:24:52,876
I, the slaughterer, the swift-footed...

591
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,037
I, Umslopogaas, holder of the axe...

592
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:03,631
the son of kings, the wolfman.

593
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:06,673
I challenge them.

594
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,596
I await them.

595
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:37,318
Umslopogaas, the axe!

596
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,557
The axe!

597
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,153
The axe!

598
01:25:59,399 --> 01:26:03,074
Don't worry.
He's got everything under control.

599
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:24,952
I've got a score to settle with you.

600
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:24,509
Ah! Ah!

601
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:41,350
Well, it looks like everything turned out
just the way I planned.

602
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:06,078
Behind you! Agon!

603
01:31:20,119 --> 01:31:24,716
I was finally able to escape, sir.
Yes, I went through hell to get here.

604
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:27,069
Please. Water.

605
01:31:28,319 --> 01:31:30,470
Water. Please.

606
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,988
Water, sir. Water.

607
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:34,993
Whoa!

608
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:47,837
Not a nice thing to do to a holy man.

609
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:52,037
Only now do I feel the battle is over.

610
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:54,229
It's not a bad place to be a hero.

611
01:31:54,359 --> 01:32:00,195
Yeah, but, uh... I've been thinking
it's time for something else.

612
01:32:00,319 --> 01:32:02,675
Some other great adventure?
