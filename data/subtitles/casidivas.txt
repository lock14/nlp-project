1
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,399
<i>Karen, check it out!</i> María Enamorada.

2
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,552
<i>That divine soap opera.</i>
<i>How long's it been on?</i>

3
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,996
<i>Five years. Look at Eva Gallardo.</i>

4
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,475
<i>- She looks dreadful.</i>
<i>- Does not!</i>

5
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,269
<i>Let's give our audience</i>
<i>that juicy gossip we promised.</i>

6
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,638
<i>Okay, but it's just a rumour. Pure grapevine.</i>

7
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,756
<i>Turns out they're making</i>
<i>a movie version of</i> María Enamorada!

8
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,118
<i>They're scouting for the new</i>
<i>María Enamorada all over Mexico.</i>

9
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,869
<i>So any girl from anywhere, Zapopan,</i>

10
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,158
<i>Coatzacoalcos, San Wackacuacka,</i>

11
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,550
<i>can audition to become a movie superstar.</i>

12
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,714
<i>Imagine! You wake up one morning</i>
<i>and you're a superstar!</i>

13
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,073
<i>I'm Francisca. Francisca Jorge.</i>

14
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,438
I want to be María Enamorada in the movie.

15
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,354
<i>Because she's pretty</i>
<i>and stuff happens to her.</i>

16
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,595
She saw this pageant.

17
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,956
<i>Where they all parade out</i>
<i>for their beauty and all.</i>

18
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,038
<i>She lapped it up.</i>

19
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,277
She'd run out of the house in her undies.

20
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,672
She'd go, "I wanna be Miss Oaxaca!"

21
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,550
<i>But nothing ever came of it.</i>

22
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,751
So like a real movie star? I don't think so.

23
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,316
<i>I love to sing. And learn stuff by heart.</i>

24
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,119
Like songs or news.

25
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,429
Now? No, I'm too embarrassed.

26
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,755
"Eva Gallardo, undisputed soap opera diva,

27
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,474
"famous for her role as María Enamorada,

28
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,950
"refused to comment
on the search for her successor

29
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,512
"for the film version of the role
that immortalised her.

30
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,311
"And now, some reactions
from the world of showbiz."

31
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,359
How dare you? I no longer love you!

32
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,757
- You feel nothing at my caress?
- Not a thing.

33
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,916
- Say it. Say it!
- Get your paws off me, asshole!

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,958
Stop shaking me! Cut!

35
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,073
- The director said to!
- To hell with the director.

36
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,628
When you jiggle me, I wobble all over.

37
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,918
- Maybe tone up the flabby triceps...
- Shut up!

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,117
- From the top, perhaps?
- You get lost, too.

39
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,431
Get me Alejandro!
Where's the damn producer?

40
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:04,117
Obviously, nobody here knows how to treat
a star who slaves 16 hours a day.

41
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,192
You shine those glaring infomercial lights

42
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,590
that pick up wrinkles I don't even have.

43
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,831
I look past 30.

44
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,557
- Find Alejandro.
- What are you hiding? Hand it over!

45
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,959
Give it!

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,831
maybe we could rehearse...

47
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,277
We're all set, Evita. Let's all calm down.

48
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,636
Eva, if you'd be so kind...

49
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,955
Yeah, well, for her to look 30,
she'd need a radio play.

50
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,039
That's the great Gallardo!

51
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,476
Hi, I'm Ximena Lizárraga.
I'm from Guadalajara.

52
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,677
I adore my mom and dad.
They're my best friends.

53
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,830
<i>The family is of long lineage.</i>
<i>The name Lizárraga goes back generations.</i>

54
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,195
If my husband gets wind
of the contest, he'll kill us.

55
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,874
As a boy, my husband played banker.

56
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,794
So cute. With little tellers and all.
You know my husband.

57
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,114
<i>Xime always dreamt of being an actress.</i>
<i>She visualised herself.</i>

58
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,714
But she was a bit on the pudgy side.

59
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,513
<i>Bite it! Bite it!</i>

60
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,834
Watch your manners, Santiago!

61
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,869
Blubber!

62
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,560
One day, she went on a diet, and bam!
She inherited the family will power.

63
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,074
Bye-bye brownies, bye-bye doughnuts.

64
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,869
And she's a Leo.
Lizárraga ascendant. Little joke!

65
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,590
So anyway... How am I doing?

66
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,679
Care for coffee? I have Baileys.

67
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,919
You see it,

68
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,833
and you go for it.

69
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,199
<i>Fifty pounds, and dropping fast.</i>

70
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,198
<i>The camera adds weight.</i>
<i>I'm two sizes smaller than I look on screen.</i>

71
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,309
<i>And since I'll be on screen forever...</i>

72
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,676
'Cause I'm doing that film.

73
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,153
And then another.

74
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,952
And tons more.

75
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,591
You see it, and you go for it.

76
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,029
- You think I need a boob job?
- Maybe. Just a tad...

77
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,876
I told her you were on long distance.

78
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,476
Yeah, well, for long distance,
you're pretty close.

79
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,595
Eva! Always lovely to see you, darling.

80
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,511
Get them two sizes bigger.
They'll look great.

81
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,151
Honey, what part of
"don't-call-us-we'll-call-you"

82
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,073
don't you get?

83
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,919
Excuse me.

84
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,230
Save your breath.
I stopped caring who you screw

85
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,877
since your little video with what's-her-face.

86
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,239
And that was what?
Two, three hundred sluts ago?

87
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,672
Seriously...

88
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,717
Where did we go wrong?

89
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,714
That stuff doesn't work any more with me.

90
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,951
Know why? 'Cause I'm over 20.

91
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,712
The light guy's a pro...

92
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,076
- Dim the lights or I'm history.
- You're thirty-fi...

93
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,513
Shut up!

94
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,791
Even NASA can't make you look 20...

95
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,190
Watch the way you talk to me.

96
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,511
I'm this network's biggest star.

97
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,196
Look, "network's biggest star,"
yesterday's ratings.

98
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,551
Things change in five years.

99
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,996
It's a crappy part! I need to do that film.

100
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,757
- And you need to kill the rumours.
- Nobody promised you the part!

101
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,069
What?

102
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,476
Nobody else can do that part.

103
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,393
Come on, Eva.

104
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,709
Who's going to swallow you

105
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:51,557
as a virginal, na:ïve, small-town girl
at your age?

106
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:57,033
What age is that?
Name one actress who can play that part.

107
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,714
Turn over any rock
and out crawls an actress.

108
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,635
- That's how I discovered you.
- Who were you before you discovered me?

109
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,476
You were nobody, baby. Nobody.
I made you.

110
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,433
Tomorrow I'm setting up
nationwide casting

111
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,230
for the new María Enamorada.
And I'll find her. I will.

112
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,035
You wouldn't dare.

113
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,316
You must've had some shred of virtue
to make me love you so.

114
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:44,310
<i>You're listening to the hottest of the hot!</i>
<i>Heads up, all you cuties!</i>

115
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,392
<i>Your big break has finally come.</i>
<i>Be the next María Enamorada</i>

116
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,917
<i>in your very own movie.</i>
<i>But hurry up! We need a new star!</i>

117
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,709
God damn it, Yesenia!

118
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,872
You leave me
with this frazzled poodle look?

119
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,918
Hi there. My name's Yesenia.

120
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,070
<i>I'm 23 and come from Ciudad Neza.</i>

121
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,712
This is Angelina.

122
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,238
Our family dog's got the blues,
'cause Brad ate a poisoned rat and died.

123
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,032
Yesenia's my sis, man.

124
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,474
She's into this artsy thing,
which is totally awesome.

125
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:31,751
<i>Like singing, you know? Singing's an art</i>
<i>where she, like, totally rules.</i>

126
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,831
<i>It's tough. People don't really</i>
<i>appreciate art around here.</i>

127
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,393
Yesenia was always into performing
and being famous and all.

128
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,556
<i>In school, she'd put on</i>
<i>these, like, choreographies.</i>

129
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,792
- What do you call them?
- "Gypnastics."

130
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,669
She'd do this Shakira number,
shake her booty all over.

131
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,837
She put on routines here with the boys.

132
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,750
In all modesty, I coached her.
Like hot, kick-ass moves.

133
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,318
Sort of like this.

134
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,872
Total class, man.

135
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,952
Cut! Cut!

136
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,758
That was before.

137
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,276
I said homework and no TV.
Who turned on the TV? Homework!

138
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,830
No wonder you don't know shit. Read!

139
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,196
Who'd I tell to do the dishes?
What's so funny?

140
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,238
They're looking for me!

141
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,275
- It's my big break, Mom!
- Fricking Yesenia.

142
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,280
Cut it out! Quit it!

143
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,318
Drop that! Quit spraying! Gimme!

144
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,795
Let someone else get the chocolate stains
off your underpants!

145
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,952
Who's looking for you?

146
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,600
I was in the beauty shop
combing a client's...

147
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,353
Hey, little buggers! Christmas time!

148
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,919
Look what the big honcho has for you.
Hi, Mom!

149
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,356
All yours! Who's your daddy?

150
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,673
You give them some dorky stolen sneakers

151
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,354
and you're the king of the jungle.

152
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,589
I feel the pride.

153
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,558
Stolen? You been hanging out with Wiskas?

154
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,834
They ain't stolen.

155
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,111
At times we disagree somewhat.

156
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,636
Stolen? Bitch!

157
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,275
Mom, I gotta tell you.

158
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,399
They're looking for
a new María Enamorada for a movie.

159
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,919
And it's gonna be me!

160
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,594
I've always been supportive of her.

161
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,519
Like they're gonna pick you! Buy a mirror!

162
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,238
We're a close-knit family.

163
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,118
- Mom!
- Mom!

164
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,000
A sister needs advice, support.

165
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,509
- She started it!
- He did!

166
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,954
I counselled her, "Give the max."

167
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,713
- Excuse me, Grandma.
- Giovanni?

168
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,869
No, Grandma.

169
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,191
- Carlos!
- Whatever.

170
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,468
No. You're Starr. Right? You're Starr.

171
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,558
It's something you just know.
Like the existence of God.

172
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,110
<i>Not that God drops by your house</i>
<i>for breakfast or stuff.</i>

173
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,792
<i>But you know.</i>

174
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,590
<i>Like when you're being two-timed.</i>

175
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,468
<i>That's pretty shabby. But you know.</i>

176
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,633
It's like that. So I just know.

177
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,073
It's a blouse.

178
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,759
It's called a top because
it's separate from the bottom.

179
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,118
The back stays open to show some skin.
So sexy.

180
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,552
María Enamorada, <i>the legendary soap opera,</i>
<i>is being made into a movie.</i>

181
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,680
<i>We're looking for the new star...</i>

182
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,079
Catalina.

183
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,591
From Ciudad Juárez.

184
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,513
Today's the 3rd, dear. Your rent is due.

185
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,156
<i>If Catalina wants, she'll win.</i>
<i>She's pig-headed.</i>

186
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,359
Once in the factory
there were a bunch of mice.

187
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,151
<i>Mice scare me shitless. But she complained.</i>

188
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,990
<i>They were like, "What plague?"</i>

189
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:07,079
So she goes and catches four mice,
dumps them in the manager's office.

190
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,677
Next day, bang! Traps all over the factory.

191
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,799
That's why she's gonna win.
She'll kick Enamorada's butt.

192
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,351
Just like those fricking mice.
May they rest in peace.

193
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,829
Good morning, ma'am.

194
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,717
<i>Your body needs pampering.</i>

195
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,554
<i>Lavish on it the care it deserves.</i>
<i>Find your balance.</i>

196
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,995
<i>Your body is always in danger.</i>

197
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,516
Maribel Flores García.

198
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,796
She worked in the factory.

199
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,712
Melissa Castillo Palma.

200
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,118
Anahí Chantal Trujillo.
Nadia Mendoza López.

201
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,552
Alejandra Regina Ramos Ortega.
Daniela Beltrán.

202
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,792
I knew them all.

203
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,956
Three are still missing.

204
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,671
The others they found.

205
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,753
<i>I'm crossing the border.</i>
<i>And I'm sending for Gladys and the girls.</i>

206
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,272
<i>Here you're nobody.</i>

207
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,111
<i>You gotta become Someone.</i>

208
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,872
<i>Someones don't disappear.</i>

209
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,397
<i>Someones move around freely.</i>
<i>Bad things don't happen to them.</i>

210
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,430
So I figured a movie star is Someone.

211
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,272
Like Salma,
who does what she damn pleases.

212
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,110
<i>So I decided,</i>
<i>"Become a star and get the hell out."</i>

213
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,310
I can't stick around here.

214
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,399
If I stay,

215
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,672
<i>they'll kidnap me.</i>

216
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,673
<i>I can feel it.</i>

217
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,151
No one wants to see 400 episodes
of the poor little virgin.

218
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,119
Now the virgin's gotta be
in all the tabloids,

219
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,795
have scandalous divorces,
and sleep with soccer stars.

220
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,155
- Bullshit like that.
- It's the boss.

221
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,990
How are you, sir? Here's the game plan.

222
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,954
Three phases. High exposure casting.

223
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,794
Aerial shots, interviews,
cameo a few hopeless cases.

224
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,189
That sells. Human interest, melodrama.

225
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,239
Narrow it down to 50 for the semifinals.

226
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,391
For the grand finale, 10.

227
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,230
Are we out of razors?

228
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,393
Live broadcasts. Phone-in votes.
Judges. We got the drill down pat.

229
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,790
We can't pluck her off the street,
but that's the point.

230
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,873
We'll polish her and polish her

231
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,872
till we turn her into a star like...

232
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,154
Like Eva Gallardo, for instance.

233
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,637
What the hell's going on?

234
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,150
Could you wait outside?

235
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,155
- I never wanted this.
- So how'd it get in the papers?

236
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,271
Lulu, go get me the layout guy.

237
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,755
One dot's missing.

238
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,319
But still it's not bad.

239
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,874
You see?

240
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,835
- The things you can think up.
- You're so damn cynical.

241
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,555
This is not the end of it.
It's just the beginning.

242
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,751
You know that door-slamming
rattles the set.

243
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,556
- You're spying on me.
- No, I was just passing by.

244
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,228
- What do you want?
- Me? Nothing.

245
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,199
Actually, something.
I came to tell you I'm off to become a star.

246
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,833
Ouch! Hey!

247
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,038
Well, if she wants to be famous...

248
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,636
- You wanna be on TV, you gotta do this.
- She made me all red!

249
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,078
- You having second thoughts?
- I don't know. Probably won't even win.

250
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,556
My ass, you won't.
Just use the headlights tactic.

251
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,675
Squeeze them boobs together
and it's all yours, baby.

252
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,115
Gladys, you are so nuts.

253
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,159
Headlights on! No judge'll notice
that bushy mono-brow of yours.

254
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,351
You gotta pluck them. You wanna win?

255
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,513
Check it out.

256
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,031
- That's the remedy for my blue balls.
- They are hot.

257
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,350
- Which flavour you want?
- Your call, boss.

258
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,432
I like the one in blue. I know you, sugar.

259
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,957
- I know you, too.
- Yeah?

260
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,958
They call you Satan. But your name's José.

261
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,031
You kidnapped Maribel.

262
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,192
You take them and turn them over.
They never return.

263
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,388
And you're next, gorgeous.

264
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,550
That's what broads need, boss.

265
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,393
You idiot! You stupid idiot!
Now you have to go to Mexico City!

266
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,713
You stick around now, they'll knife you!
What a stupid idiot!

267
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,516
So, Xime, what'll you tell your dad?

268
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,988
Meet me at the Oscars.

269
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,709
Listen, ever think that in Mexico City
you might run into Santiago?

270
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,795
What Santiago? I am so over that jerk.

271
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,116
- You were so gaga.
- "Were."

272
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,392
Past tense.

273
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,873
When he finds out I won the contest,
sees my skinny new bod...

274
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,549
His loss.

275
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,430
He'll die when my picture's
on all the billboards.

276
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,755
Let him grovel for calling me Blubber
when I told him I liked him.

277
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,313
Let him cry, get down on his knees.

278
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,117
I could care less.

279
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,511
<i>Expecting a high of 50 today, clear skies.</i>

280
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,116
<i>And Efrain García brings you</i>
<i>the hottest news from showbiz.</i>

281
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,160
<i>The clip we're about to show you...</i>

282
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,112
<i>I could help you go far on TV.</i>

283
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,916
<i>Baby, you like these puppies?</i>

284
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,233
<i>- Bought them just for you.</i>
<i>- Never seen better.</i>

285
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,596
<i>This was sent in by an unidentified source...</i>

286
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,671
- Hello?
<i>- Hi there.</i>

287
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,511
- Eva?
<i>- Imagine.</i>

288
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,831
<i>Three years ago when I got that video</i>
<i>of the two of you,</i>

289
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,037
<i>I thought it was only good</i>
<i>for screwing up my life.</i>

290
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,358
<i>And now it's going to screw up yours.</i>

291
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,512
<i>The things you can think up.</i>

292
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,239
I swear it was only once.

293
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,118
And you didn't have to put it
on national TV.

294
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,113
Francisca.

295
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,836
What does it say? I can't read.

296
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,271
"For Domingo from Francisca.

297
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,234
"I admire you and care for you a lot.

298
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,909
"Even if you love María Enamorada,

299
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,631
"I, Francisca, love you."

300
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:33,956
622, 623, 624, 625...

301
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:38,989
Time to go. Daddy's still sleeping.
Enrique will drive you to the airport.

302
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,758
Here, dear. Xime...

303
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,999
Don't go looking for that ass, Santiago.

304
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,878
He told the whole town
you were a whale, dear.

305
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,317
Blubber, Mom. Not the same thing.

306
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,475
- You gonna call me, bitch?
- Every day.

307
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,271
And don't forget,

308
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,311
headlights on!

309
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,910
Goodbye.

310
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,478
You don't like it?

311
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,118
It's not that.

312
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,349
I hooked up the lights and everything.

313
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,832
- They blink.
- I noticed.

314
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,829
- It's even got a pink rug.
- You don't like it.

315
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,797
- The thing is...
- You hate it.

316
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,233
I don't hate it.

317
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,993
- At least, admit it.
- Okay, it's tacky.

318
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,510
Ever heard of tact?

319
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,673
You're not going to upset me. I'll call you.

320
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,230
Pardon me.
Is this the way to the, uh, contest...

321
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,190
The TV contest on TV?

322
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,950
No, dear. That's that way, and far.

323
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,476
You're lost. Honestly, these girls!

324
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,149
Sir, you said it was this way.
The TV's that way.

325
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,073
TV? Give me a break, lady.

326
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,359
- Stop. I have to get off.
- The bus stop's over there.

327
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,513
- But I'm so far away! Pull over!
- There's no stop, I told you.

328
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,232
Everybody move back.

329
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,548
Dizzy dame!

330
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,632
Look out!

331
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,193
...with more than 3,000
of the prettiest girls in Mexico!

332
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,394
The place is packed and full of energy!
Gorgeous girls galore!

333
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,558
- Your name?
- Laura.

334
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,551
- Excited?
- Totally!

335
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,916
- How do you resemble María?
- The hair, the whole look.

336
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,877
- Confident?
- I'll win!

337
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,712
- You excited?
- A bunch.

338
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,678
You don't look it.
Come on, some excitement!

339
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,955
How hard was it to do this?

340
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,874
Hard! Tons of tests, gigantic trip...

341
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,552
An hour's drive? Huge effort!

342
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,189
- Why play María Enamorada?
- I don't know.

343
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,032
- You admire her?
- Since I was little.

344
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,076
- Confident?
- Absolutely.

345
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,230
- In what?
- My self-confidence.

346
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,312
What would you be willing to do
to get the part?

347
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,913
Whatever it takes!

348
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,594
- Where's the costume from?
- Mexico.

349
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,194
Way to go. Haute couture?

350
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,793
- Ready for the casting?
- Yeth, I'm the thuper thtar!

351
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,189
- Name?
- María Enamorada!

352
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,550
Hi out there in Tulancingo!

353
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,995
Access now commencing!
Numbers 1 to 100, get ready!

354
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,994
Wrong programme, Rapunzel.

355
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,437
It's PG-13.

356
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,117
What were you thinking?

357
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,353
Thank you, thank you.

358
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,197
It's not a sweet sixteen party.

359
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,708
To the left.

360
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,594
Number? To the left.

361
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,831
How many chicks on the video?
Got any more like that?

362
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,836
Press conference at 6:00.
I'll answer all questions.

363
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,399
You're all invited.

364
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,473
Give me a break.

365
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,709
What are you doing here, Wiskas?

366
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,233
A little bird told me you need a ride back.

367
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,998
- Hop in, baby.
- Now you're all sugar sweet.

368
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,198
Well, screw you.

369
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,673
- I told you to get in.
- Let me go, dickhead.

370
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,036
- Now, look!
- Get in, sugar.

371
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,193
I know you want it. Come on, baby...

372
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,153
You stinking Indian.

373
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,679
You go, girl! That'll teach you.

374
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,797
- Touch me again...
- Fucking bitches!

375
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,279
Run, girl!

376
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,550
You ugly hoes!

377
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,072
Frigging skanks!

378
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,389
Fuck!

379
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,600
Hey! I'm talking to you.

380
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,754
- Let go of me.
- Let go of me, what?

381
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,673
Let go of me, please.
Stupid.

382
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,274
I was first, missy.

383
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,036
And I'll mess your face so bad
they'll have to hide it with make-up.

384
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,319
Make-up is what you need.

385
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,956
And lessons on how to use it.

386
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,792
- At your place?
- Where else?

387
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,594
You're not exactly on a package tour.

388
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,352
That's my beauty spa.
Chofi, how's business?

389
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,471
It's decided then. My place.

390
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:36,998
And after the way we kicked Wiskas' ass,
we're sort of sisters-in-arms.

391
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,996
Boy, was he pissed off.

392
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,311
I'll piss his balls off
if I catch the bastard again.

393
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,998
How do you piss off his... Thingies?

394
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:54,154
Couple of karate kicks. Three per ball.
They'll pop right out his ass.

395
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,238
For 100 each, this place isn't too grungy.

396
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,436
What'll you do if you win?

397
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,269
I'm gonna buy me a house.
I brought it along.

398
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,992
I fit inside.

399
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,114
Hi, I'm Jazmin. Kiss my ass.

400
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,669
- Suckers!
- You're wacky.

401
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,237
Yup. What if you win?

402
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,118
I'm crossing the border with my girlfriends.

403
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,549
- And then?
- And then...

404
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,880
- Know what I've never done?
- What?

405
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,634
Seen snow.

406
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,317
Last year it snowed in Juárez.
I was in Durango.

407
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,314
My mom said the only time she saw snow

408
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,992
she thought clouds
were falling from the sky.

409
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,433
And she cried.

410
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,554
Welcome to our pigsty. Mom!

411
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,312
Dear! That girl Carlos is here.

412
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,199
- They picked me, Mommy!
- What's that?

413
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,876
My friend, Frank. She's staying overnight.

414
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,395
How about a little enthusiasm? Joy?

415
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,473
Joy? There's no water for the beans.

416
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,438
They cut the water off. There's your joy.

417
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,070
Lose that skateboard, damn it!

418
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,189
Don't be rude, you little snot-nose.

419
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,956
- Up yours.
- Yesi!

420
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,314
I heard they picked you! Let's go to Enigma.

421
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,316
I can't. I need my beauty sleep.

422
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,559
Like we used to.
You don't need beauty sleep.

423
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,232
We can dance.

424
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,717
I can't, Jonathan.

425
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,312
My friend, Frank,
behind Grandma's panties. Say hi.

426
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,830
Hi, Frank. How come "no"?
Let's twirl and stuff...

427
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:22,792
What part of "that junky bus sucked
and no way we're going dancing"

428
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,110
didn't you understand?

429
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,317
You don't love me
'cause you're gonna be famous.

430
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:33,278
You're not hearing me.
That dickhead Wiskas stalked us.

431
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,271
You're not the same.

432
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,516
- You think you're from Miami?
- I am the same.

433
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,319
But that jerk Wiskas molested us.

434
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,118
Know what? I don't love you any more.

435
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,879
So there.

436
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,833
Happy now?

437
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,473
You're cruel.

438
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,799
- He was a fag, anyway.
- And you're such a macho. Mini-runt!

439
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,795
<i>No idea where they got it, sir.</i>

440
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,159
Yes, sir. Hello?

441
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,953
- The doorman's my fan.
- Why are you here?

442
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,237
I came to see you in your starring role.

443
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,076
The flat's not bad.

444
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,396
<i>I'm not made of stone, guys.</i>

445
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,199
<i>But I'd like to emphasise</i>
<i>the movie's not to blame.</i>

446
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,838
María Enamorada <i>belongs to the fans.</i>

447
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,273
<i>- What about Eva?</i>
<i>- Eva is a great lady.</i>

448
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,279
<i>And a great actress. A real pro.</i>

449
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,395
<i>She'd never stoop to a trick so low.</i>

450
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,238
<i>How's the casting going?</i>

451
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,718
You're such hot shit.

452
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,072
One point for me.

453
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:32,277
How was your casting? Find any like me?

454
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,516
There's nobody like you.

455
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,840
But I'll Pygmalion her, too.

456
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,473
Ah, the high-drama face slap.

457
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,519
- Life isn't a soap...
- I never saw this in a soap. You?

458
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,948
- Let go.
- Let what go? I don't feel anything there.

459
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,191
- You love touching it.
- You wish.

460
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,714
I hate you.

461
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,873
And I hate you.

462
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,074
Santiago.

463
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,633
There's Blubber!

464
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,873
<i>Excess baggage is history.</i>

465
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,634
<i>Vital lightens your load.</i>

466
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,077
I do love him, but...

467
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,751
He can be such a hick. And he's so touchy.

468
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,720
And now you. Why are you crying?

469
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,795
Your boyfriend's a hick, too?

470
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,193
I think I have to go back home.

471
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,832
You know what?
You're nobody if you're from Oaxaca.

472
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,831
And a Zapotec Indian.

473
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,118
And the only ride to Mexico City
is a four-mile hike away.

474
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,273
You're nobody.

475
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,639
Look, sweetie. I didn't always look like this.

476
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,676
If you have to become someone else
to do what you want,

477
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,716
be someone else.

478
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,035
You want to be someone else?

479
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,999
All right, then.

480
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,230
Tomorrow we'll figure it out.

481
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,357
Now I just need to turn Jonathan
into someone else.

482
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,518
Don't you think Jonathan is a little...

483
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,677
- What?
- Nothing.

484
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,714
Fruity.

485
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,596
Okay, twat, the honcho's home...

486
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,192
Who you with?

487
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,675
So now you do it with chicks?
Give me a break!

488
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,397
Honey, I'd switch beds for some real action.

489
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,392
Son of a bitch! Respect my friend.

490
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,710
You respect my nuts! That hurt!

491
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,154
Mom!

492
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,118
- What's your problem?
- Mom!

493
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,271
But with a soccer star?

494
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,070
That's the cliché of all clichés.

495
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,789
But it got to you, didn't it? Hey.

496
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,916
The casting's off, right?

497
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,474
I just can't call it off.

498
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,474
Let's just put you in another movie.

499
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,674
Get a more complex script.

500
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,069
With a more interesting character.

501
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,634
- Somewhat more mature.
- What do you mean, mature?

502
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,393
Eva, news flash. You dye your hair.

503
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,074
Fine. You do your little casting.

504
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,595
- I'll do my little war.
- I'll let your stunt slide for old times' sake.

505
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,835
This has only just begun.

506
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,876
Elevators tend to ruin dramatic exits.

507
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,157
Drop dead. You and your grey-haired balls!

508
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,071
Still two floors to go.

509
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,351
- You're gorgeous.
- You mean it?

510
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,588
That's some damn transformation.

511
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,358
Let's go to my place.

512
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,551
- You really want me?
- Really bad.

513
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,156
- Really, really bad?
- Baby, you're killing me.

514
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,479
Pity.

515
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,753
'Cause we blubbers
don't go to bed with pigs.

516
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,114
Asshole.

517
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,399
Sleep tight.

518
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,109
If you want a script, you have to...

519
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,636
- Trash.
- Fatso.

520
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,831
Hands off!
You lay your hands on me once more...

521
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,918
May I have one?

522
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,389
- Your name, please?
- Ximena Lizárraga.

523
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,030
Don't I look like Beyoncé?

524
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,032
Hair down to the ass,
guaranteed working class.

525
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,435
They bleached Britney blonde, too.

526
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,310
How do you like it?

527
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,592
It's not me.

528
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,991
It's María Enamorada.

529
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,833
Just might be.

530
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,030
Actually not.
'Cause Enamorada's gonna be me.

531
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,557
No, me.

532
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,949
No.

533
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,669
Me.

534
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,393
Just think.

535
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,429
You go to the movies. The picture starts.

536
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,871
The opening credits appear.

537
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,229
And suddenly, there you are.

538
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,198
I can't imagine.

539
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,956
I've never been to the movies.

540
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,272
Look at her, Frank.

541
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,280
That could be you. Look!

542
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,993
I'm done?

543
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,397
What? What's wrong?

544
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,472
You didn't read the scenes
Alejandro added?

545
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,429
Where your character has an accident?

546
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,430
I'll kill the filthy bastard!

547
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,031
Don't, they'll throw you in jail.

548
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,069
I'll kill him! Dead!

549
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,588
Here, darling. Get well soon.

550
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,239
Your weapon of choice?
The only award you've ever won.

551
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,548
Alejandro! What happened?

552
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,549
My character had an accident.

553
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,638
Hey, didn't I ask for two spotlights?

554
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,234
What happened to them? Lulu, your job!

555
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,958
- You look fat.
- Told you so.

556
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,917
I have a vintage figure!

557
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,595
Let go of me, stupid.

558
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,557
I'll knock the shit out of you.

559
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,110
Ugh! She's not only sneaky,
she's foul-mouthed, too.

560
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,997
Get her out of here.

561
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:35,436
- Touch me and I'll bite you.
- Okay, what's all this?

562
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,752
She called her "Indian."
Kept her out because she's Indian.

563
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,714
Isn't that ugly, Señor Mateos?

564
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,119
Sir, that In...

565
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,474
She tried to sneak in without an armband.

566
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,795
Jessie, please enrol her as a contestant.

567
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,394
Get her a dress. And you, out.

568
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,838
Lulu, please see to it
that this doesn't happen again.

569
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,753
You really think that girl
could ever be Enamorada?

570
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,991
The last thing we need
is to be labelled racist.

571
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:12,352
And anyone can be a star.
It'll boost our ratings.

572
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,638
Spotlights! People, hop to it!

573
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,958
Hello, Mexico!

574
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:25,592
Welcome to our TV special to select
the new star of the Mexican screen.

575
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,231
Please welcome our contestants!

576
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:36,149
- One lucky girl will be...
- María Enamorada.

577
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,719
A big hand for our expert judges.

578
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,549
The divine diva Karen Trigo

579
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,995
and the eminent Manolo Verdejo.

580
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:07,793
And now, let's meet our shooting stars.

581
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,796
From Chihuahua, Chihuahua... Sandra!

582
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,349
Step up, beautiful.

583
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,352
I never thought I'd stoop so low.

584
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,718
I never sought... Sawed...
Thought I'd soup so slow.

585
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,711
I never thought I'd stoop so low.

586
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,270
Often one must stoop quite low
to make dreams come true.

587
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:38,111
I'm willing to stoop and then some
for my dreams.

588
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,276
Never did I... Think so slow.

589
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,670
I dream of you, my hero,

590
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,553
Ramiro.

591
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,993
That's all.

592
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,237
I never thought I'd stoop so low.

593
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,919
I got it, huh?

594
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,551
So you say, Yesi, baby,

595
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,549
no choice for you but stardom.

596
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,555
Who else has that luscious bod
that the Big G gave you?

597
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,429
You're a jewel to be polished with care.
You're stunning.

598
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,312
- You're...
- The pits.

599
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,517
I've witnessed the greats, and you...

600
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,154
You? What are you here for?

601
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,119
Gazing at you makes me want to...

602
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,599
Shoot you dead.

603
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,233
Bravo!

604
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,198
Time to take your bow, baby.

605
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,669
My name's Ximena. Remember it.

606
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,310
My name is unimportant,
because it'll soon be Enamorada.

607
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:48,353
Fierce competition.
Down to 20 starry-eyed dreamers.

608
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,429
She looked stunning.
We got the dress in Texas.

609
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,109
<i>The verdict's in.</i>

610
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,633
It is, indeed.

611
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:58,393
But first, I'd like to thank

612
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:02,753
<i>all of you beauties for your huge effort,</i>

613
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,037
<i>one I'd call Herculean.</i>

614
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,034
But life isn't easy. Some come, some go.

615
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,429
I remain.

616
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,033
You bet, doll baby!

617
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,911
The first girl is...

618
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,958
The first... What a thrill!

619
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,429
The first is Ximena.

620
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,678
Step forward.

621
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,317
<i>My pretty,</i>

622
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,312
you are major league material.

623
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,479
Exquisite beauty and charisma.

624
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:41,030
- She's banging the producer.
- Oh, they all are.

625
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,678
How prosaic!

626
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,755
Ximena.

627
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,554
You...

628
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,115
You are out!

629
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,435
Couldn't resist watching, huh?

630
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,676
I didn't come to watch.

631
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,789
- I came to give you a gift.
- What gift?

632
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,270
One thing I don't get. That Ximena girl.

633
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,789
The only one who's got what it takes.
Why toss her?

634
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,356
She thinks she's a diva.

635
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,951
But the only diva

636
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,228
is you.

637
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,432
Coming through!

638
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,351
<i>And finally... This has gotta hurt...</i>

639
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:11,117
Jazmin, sorry, sweetheart,
but kiss Enamorada goodbye.

640
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:17,319
And the other 10,
my beauties, are our happy finalists

641
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,271
for <i>María Enamorada!</i>

642
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,675
<i>It's thrilling!</i>

643
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:45,437
<i>Your turn, Mexico, to vote for your favourite.</i>
<i>Call the number on screen!</i>

644
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,798
- Dial and decide the next...
- María Enamorada!

645
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,879
They charge by the minute?

646
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:02,590
Bimbo! By the call.
Like that idol thingy show.

647
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,391
It's 20 pesos a call.

648
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,076
Dial! Dial! It's on me!

649
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,950
Out or not, I vote for Ximena.

650
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,157
Don't worry, girl.

651
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:21,391
Worry about who you're gonna get
to split the hotel bill.

652
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,471
Oh, dear. Take care of yourself.

653
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,754
Watch out they don't snow you
up there in the snow.

654
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,994
What?

655
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,679
I have to put out to get the part?

656
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,910
Alejandro. From Eva.

657
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:51,314
<i>Here's the ending you stole</i>
<i>from that other soap. Remember?</i>

658
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,278
<i>I'm sure your boss</i>
<i>would be thrilled to know.</i>

659
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,271
<i>Might just lose your movie.</i>

660
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,510
Is that tomorrow's script?

661
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:40,719
And this would be my Enamorada corset.
Sewed it myself.

662
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,791
Yesi!

663
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,793
I saw you on TV.

664
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,631
I got you the deluxe box set special
of the sitcom.

665
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,711
It's called a soap opera.

666
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,152
Legal or pirated?

667
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,473
Tacky.

668
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,793
Okay, get up.

669
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,708
- So, got a boyfriend?
- No, but I plan to.

670
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:20,875
- You loving his ass?
- Oh, no. No, not just... No, I'm not...

671
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,400
I mean, do you really like him?

672
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,196
Oh, Domingo is so...

673
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:34,755
One day in the rain he held his jacket
over my head and walked me home.

674
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,634
I sort of felt like saying,

675
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,189
"You smell so nice, Domingo."

676
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,993
But he just stood there staring at me.

677
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:50,874
I couldn't say a word.
I just ran away and felt all tingly.

678
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,674
Don't go thinking that I...

679
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:21,195
Let's just go to bed. To sleep.

680
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:27,037
Why don't you just sleep in Osiris' bed?

681
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,030
It's Friday night. He stays out till dawn.

682
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,000
<i>Is Gladys there?</i>

683
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,793
Can you tell her Catalina called?

684
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,195
Thanks.

685
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,357
Sorry, did I scare you?

686
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:01,796
What? I'm gonna have to put out
to get the part?

687
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,356
Would you put out?

688
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,757
Look. Last year I crossed the border.

689
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,199
And got caught.

690
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:17,629
Before I was deported,
two immigration bastards raped me.

691
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,831
So you think I'd care?

692
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,876
Did you turn them in?

693
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,953
You're really clueless
about the world outside your soaps.

694
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:34,389
- You think I could learn?
- You really care?

695
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,718
Listen. I've had a shitty day.

696
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,196
I'd love to have dinner
with someone interesting.

697
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,552
Okay, tell you what.

698
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:52,231
I'll wait for you there. Think it over.

699
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:56,911
Ten minutes. You decide no,
that's fine. No problem.

700
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,711
I haven't got a watch.

701
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,757
Looking for someone?

702
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:47,677
- No one.
- Let's go, then.

703
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,593
Glad you changed your mind, baby.

704
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:40,232
Hands off her, asshole!
And now this limp-dick shows up.

705
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:45,038
You go, girl! Kick him!

706
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:48,199
Quit fighting. You're family!

707
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:57,112
Boy, did he deserve that!

708
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,630
With any luck you killed him.

709
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,314
- I wanna piece of that, too.
- Off her!

710
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,836
You slimeball. Get off me!

711
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,194
Wiskas, you creep!

712
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:12,632
Don't mess with my blood!

713
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,556
Grab your stuff.

714
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,917
Mommy! Osiris is kicking someone's ass!

715
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,117
- What's up?
- We had to make our getaway.

716
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:41,196
It was so late
we decided to come straight here.

717
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,115
- So scoot over.
- Why?

718
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:49,234
'Cause it's cold
and we can cuddle up and get warm.

719
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,959
- You got kicked out?
- Kicked in the butt.

720
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,994
Men! They're all horny slimeballs.

721
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:00,913
Bastards.

722
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:07,718
<i>So you stole that scene, you sneak?</i>

723
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:12,715
- No, she just wants to get even.
<i>- Did you steal it or not?</i>

724
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:17,157
- No, I did not steal that scene.
<i>- Whatever.</i>

725
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:21,199
- It's all under control.
<i>- Keep your woman in line, schmuck.</i>

726
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,748
I know, sir. Hello?

727
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,355
Hi.

728
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,270
- What are you doing here?
- What do you mean?

729
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:41,153
After last night, I stayed over, obviously.

730
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:44,790
Last night I sent you home
without touching you.

731
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,349
So you weren't in the mood.

732
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,474
Doesn't mean we can't get it on now.

733
01:03:56,080 --> 01:04:00,073
Can't get it up? In the car you could.

734
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:05,157
This will not get you a ticket to the finals.

735
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,995
You are out. So if you don't mind...

736
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,719
You sure?

737
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,869
Think it over. You might regret it.

738
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,959
Look, kid.

739
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:25,151
Classier women than you, who I did screw,

740
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:29,116
have threatened me to get the part.
Unsuccessfully.

741
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:34,271
So take my advice. When you leave,
close the door behind you.

742
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,349
Daddy?

743
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,310
- It's Xime.
<i>- You get back home now!</i>

744
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,030
<i>You're making a fool of me!</i>

745
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,791
Daddy, they kicked me out.

746
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,037
<i>- You?</i>
- Yes, me.

747
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,958
And everyone saw it.

748
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:29,112
I look like a zombie. I won't win shit
with these bags under my eyes.

749
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:30,828
Let's see.

750
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:38,238
Go down to the cafeteria,
get two slices of cucumber and some ice.

751
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,434
How much you think they charge?

752
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,354
Really?

753
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:53,080
- Thanks!
- Hurry up!

754
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,598
And you hurry and put those on.
We gotta go.

755
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,112
How do these go?

756
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:14,553
Listen, Yesi, how do these things...

757
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,919
You've got a...

758
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,359
It's a hormonal imbalance.

759
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:31,235
Hormonal imbalance?
That's a weenie and you're a bastard.

760
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,356
Hold on!

761
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:39,592
- I was born a man, but not a bastard.
- That's why you kissed me.

762
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:47,477
That was a chick thing.
I mean, woman-to-wom...

763
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,316
You're mixing me up.

764
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:56,556
Damn, I never pee standing up.
But my pantyhose were such a pain.

765
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,548
My name is...

766
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,475
Carlos.

767
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,475
That's why your grandma called you...

768
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,349
And why Osiris kicked you in the...

769
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:23,554
- And Jonathan...
- Is a fag.

770
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:28,875
That's why I get taunted.
And that's why I became a woman.

771
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,188
Look at me!

772
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,193
No, see me.

773
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,751
See me.

774
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,638
I can be another.

775
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,309
I can.

776
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,439
You can't.

777
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,039
You're a man.

778
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,191
You can't win the contest.

779
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,673
You can't, Yesi... Carlos.

780
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,434
You can't.

781
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,153
I can, too.

782
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,159
I can.

783
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:25,475
Please.

784
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,436
Don't tell anyone, Francisca.

785
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,633
Please. Please.

786
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,308
I surrender.

787
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,394
If you plan to play dirty, I give up.

788
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:52,468
So soon?

789
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,829
- I don't get it.
- What?

790
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:02,076
You're not going to play your trump?

791
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:06,077
Tell the press you were a call girl
when I met you?

792
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:09,716
When you met me, Alejandro, I was a whore.

793
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,075
Expensive, but a whore.

794
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,514
You're not throwing them the story?

795
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,032
I wasn't going to leak
the stolen scene story.

796
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,672
I wanted to scare you.

797
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,958
It's not that.

798
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:38,033
This email is
from one of our main sponsors.

799
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:41,829
It's a bank. If they pull out, I'm fired.

800
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:47,715
And they're threatening to pull
if I don't rethink some of my decisions.

801
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,869
I'm guessing the banker's your lover.

802
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:03,036
Sure! That kid I took back to my place.

803
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:07,069
It pissed her off.
She's a Lizárraga. Daddy's the boss...

804
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,799
Even without the part,
you're screwing them.

805
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:13,875
- I didn't screw her.
- Sure, it was a pyjama party.

806
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,748
Basically.

807
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:30,708
My cell.

808
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:39,512
Pardon me. Is the movie contest here?

809
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:43,668
- Two blocks down. The main entrance.
- Thank you.

810
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,393
Hi, it's me.

811
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,230
You have to do me a favour.

812
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:06,872
Girls, line up back there. Quiet, please.

813
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,398
- You nervous?
- Sort of.

814
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:14,708
- Are you?
- I guess so.

815
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:20,155
I so wanted to reach
my girlfriend back home for luck.

816
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,639
Call her.

817
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:23,594
- Really?
- Sure.

818
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:26,399
- God, thanks!
- No problem.

819
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:32,397
Doña Liz? It's Catalina. Is Gladys there?

820
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,479
Yes, I'll wait.

821
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:41,395
Hi.

822
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:43,958
Learn anything?

823
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,438
It's not so simple.

824
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,428
Claudia.

825
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:02,235
What happened? What happened?
I don't understand.

826
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:05,913
What happened?

827
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,390
When was she last seen?

828
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,034
With Satan?

829
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,714
So not fair. She was out.

830
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,999
If she's back in, they want her to win.

831
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:36,153
What do you care? You can't win, anyway.

832
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,348
Why not?

833
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,080
You gonna spill the beans, girlfriend?

834
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:48,549
- They'll notice.
- You didn't.

835
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:51,633
People see what they want to see, hon.

836
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,470
You were told to stay in line.

837
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,474
Wait, sir!

838
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:15,198
We're on live. He can wait.
Okay, all contestants in position.

839
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,998
That rich bitch get to you?

840
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:34,073
What's wrong?

841
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:36,953
What's wrong?

842
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:42,073
- My friend's missing.
- Missing?

843
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,518
They took her away.

844
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,472
They took her away.

845
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,634
Let's go.

846
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:59,395
You can't go out there like that.
We'll just tell them...

847
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:05,870
Good evening, Mexico!

848
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:10,193
Welcome to <i>María Enamorada: The Search.</i>

849
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,316
<i>Thank you for all your calls.</i>

850
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,393
<i>Phone votes are valid until the very end.</i>

851
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,599
Thought I was gone, huh?

852
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:22,239
That you'd win.

853
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:25,834
Quiet!

854
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,076
I don't know what your story is.

855
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:34,276
But I'm going bald from starvation.
I've had four plastic surgeries.

856
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:37,397
Been hospitalised for spitting up blood.

857
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:39,988
Why?

858
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,991
- Because...
- You're on.

859
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:52,430
You're not going anywhere, honey.
And Daddy's ads are staying on the air.

860
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,238
Get over here.

861
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,789
...in the finals of <i>María Enamorada.</i>

862
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:03,796
You're crazy. And old. And a has-been.

863
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:07,873
You're not banging the producer any more,
so nobody gives a shit about you.

864
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:12,431
What I shared with Alejandro
is way beyond you.

865
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:17,196
What might sink in is your Daddy's call girl.
My girlfriends know her.

866
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:21,592
And since Daddy wants it hush-hush,
he's cool with your being ousted.

867
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:29,234
Just kidding, folks,
to see if you're all still awake!

868
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:32,835
You know Ximena was eliminated
in the last round.

869
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,834
You going to throw a tantrum
on national TV?

870
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,194
Be my guest.

871
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:45,078
No, huh? Know why?

872
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,632
Divas are born.

873
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:50,678
You don't become one
by reading <i>Starstudded.</i>

874
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,756
Looks like the boss is here.

875
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:14,910
The finalists for <i>María Enamorada,</i>

876
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,312
<i>the upcoming movie! Don't miss it!</i>

877
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,392
<i>For our first challenge...</i>

878
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,235
- Is there a ballgame on?
- Yesi's on TV!

879
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,992
<i>They've never seen the script.</i>

880
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:35,910
Check her out! No shit! Shove over.

881
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,310
- Shut up! I can't hear.
- You shut up. Mom!

882
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,918
Shut both your traps.

883
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,598
- Welcome.
- A pleasure to be here.

884
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,557
A star is born! What a thrill!

885
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,235
Action!

886
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:55,519
- What the heck is this?
- I've always loved you.

887
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,558
Every time you bug another...

888
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,073
Every time you hug another woman...

889
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:05,709
That's, like, so mean... 'Cause I love you...

890
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,036
That's how come I love you...

891
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:21,075
<i>Straight from the Ithmuth, Thithmuth,</i>

892
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,958
<i>Thithmus, Isthmus Oaxaca...</i>

893
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:26,239
<i>Francisca!</i>

894
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:32,438
What do you have to say?

895
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:36,431
I'm obsessed with you.

896
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:40,596
Even when I'm asleep. When I'm awake.

897
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:42,113
When I breathe.

898
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,919
And I love you.

899
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,235
A woman is a mystery.

900
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,832
We all have secrets.

901
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,394
We're all deep down someone else.

902
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,155
So...

903
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,633
You know what? Come here.

904
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:17,400
I'll show you all my secrets.
You'll love it, big guy.

905
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:28,951
Shit, I knew Yesenia would make it big.

906
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:30,919
Do your stuff, Yesi!

907
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,517
- Nah, she won't.
- Yeah, she will.

908
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:37,073
I don't need to hear I can. Because I can.

909
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:40,717
I don't need to hear who I am.
Because I know.

910
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:43,279
I don't need to.

911
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:46,992
I don't need anything.

912
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:09,873
<i>I realised</i>

913
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:15,313
if nobody helps us in Juarez,
then we have to help ourselves.

914
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,593
Funny, huh?

915
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:25,153
I went so far to find out that all I needed

916
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,353
was to stay home.

917
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,233
Do something, damn it!

918
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,077
<i>Maybe Gladys'll turn up.</i>

919
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:53,759
Maybe not.

920
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:56,832
But we gotta search.

921
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:00,757
And if I'm busy
acting like a goose in movies,

922
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,517
who's gonna find her?

923
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:11,350
Our judges will now announce
the three contestants

924
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:13,431
Mexico has selected

925
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:17,308
to enter the final round of our contest.

926
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,629
With us now, Dr Oscar Fonseca,

927
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:24,598
from the Regulations Committee. Go ahead.

928
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,159
Doctor, sir.

929
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:35,395
The audience has good taste.
I told you, Manny.

930
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,436
Indeed, they have.

931
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,480
Because these girls

932
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,590
are the most talented.

933
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:49,196
- Say it, for Christ's sake!
- Spit it out!

934
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:54,956
- Shit, they pay them by the frigging minute?
- Hush up!

935
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,992
Geez, I can't hear the TV
with all your yapping.

936
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,632
<i>Should I tell them?</i>

937
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:05,872
Enough suspense!
You're giving us all a heart attack!

938
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,115
<i>They are</i>

939
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:11,079
Sandra, Yesenia and Francisca!

940
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,958
Our three finalists

941
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,475
for <i>María Enamorada!</i>

942
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:23,030
Wow, that's my bitchin' brother!
Queer power!

943
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,068
Shit, Yesi's on TV!

944
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:31,388
Jonathan? Bro-in-law! Come on over, dude.

945
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,553
Yo, bro-in-law.

946
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:36,029
Come watch your ho with us on TV, dude.

947
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:41,392
Have a seat, buddy!
Make room for my main man!

948
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,357
Mom, beer me and bro here.

949
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:46,034
Get them yourself, lazy ass.
With your dough!

950
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:49,712
No wonder you don't dig chicks, dude.

951
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:52,874
<i>And for the big moment,</i>

952
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:57,353
Adrián Miranda, <i>Enamorada's</i> leading man.

953
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:01,198
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

954
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:07,110
I'd like to tell the girls
that even though only one girl wins,

955
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,480
the runners-up will get a part, too.

956
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,873
Excellent news!

957
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,237
Interview time! Step up, Yesenia.

958
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,270
- Hi, Yesenia.
- Hi, Adrián.

959
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,718
Tell us why you should be
María Enamorada.

960
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:36,912
Because when I go to the movies
and the lights dim,

961
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,956
it's like I feel

962
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,911
my life isn't my life.

963
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:49,037
It's the life on screen.

964
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,511
And I wish it were so.

965
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,877
I don't want it to end

966
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:02,278
when the lights go up
and the popcorn is all gone.

967
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,790
God, you're gorgeous.

968
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:15,718
Totally, Yesi. Good vibes.

969
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:22,151
Whom do you most admire?

970
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:27,878
I'd say Benito Juárez
for his legacy of wisdom.

971
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,518
"The right... Uh...

972
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,996
"Respect for others' rights is peace."

973
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:41,992
If you were president for a day,
how would you change Mexico?

974
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:45,872
I'd change the name.

975
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:48,236
The name? Of what?

976
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:50,679
Of the country.

977
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:54,478
In school we learn

978
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:58,279
it's called United States of Mexico.

979
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:05,399
But it's not.
Oaxaca is one thing. This is another.

980
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:08,954
<i>I'm from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.</i>

981
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:11,159
<i>That's a different Mexico.</i>

982
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,956
You have to begin somewhere.

983
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,389
Maybe by telling it like it is.

984
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:21,519
I think so.

985
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:35,514
Phone lines are closing.

986
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:39,790
Ten! Nine! Eight!

987
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,316
My vote goes to Yesenia!

988
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:46,477
I vote for Francisca.

989
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,029
One!

990
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:50,749
Zero!

991
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:53,673
No more phone calls!

992
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:56,071
<i>Hell of a rating, man.</i>

993
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:01,197
<i>Go make them and break them.</i>
<i>Doesn't matter who won.</i>

994
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:03,152
<i>Let's do lunch, buddy.</i>

995
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:11,030
You've made the decision?

996
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:18,955
Yes.

997
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:25,592
Well, now. Manolo, you go first.

998
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:34,271
I'm sure you're dying to know
if you could be María Enamorada.

999
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,112
Let me tell you that...

1000
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:40,629
Yes...

1001
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:42,039
...enia!

1002
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:44,509
You could be María Enamorada.

1003
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,274
Come forward.

1004
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:52,354
Francisca.

1005
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:57,670
You've come all the way from Oaxaca,
cheese paradise.

1006
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,870
You've put your heart into it.

1007
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:06,635
Now it's time to hit the road home.

1008
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:09,674
Because you won't be María Enamorada.

1009
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:15,119
<i>Francisca, step forward.</i>

1010
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:18,629
<i>It's okay.</i>

1011
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:21,719
<i>You look lovely.</i>

1012
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:29,753
You'll still get a part in <i>María Enamorada.</i>
How do you feel?

1013
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,838
<i>When the moment comes,</i>

1014
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,871
it doesn't matter any more.

1015
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:38,993
Makes no difference.

1016
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:43,756
A word to the other girls.

1017
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:49,869
Good luck.

1018
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:58,830
Thank you, Francisca.
Gorgeous girl, pick up your prizes.

1019
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:02,792
Let's hear it for Francisca.

1020
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:09,669
And now.

1021
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:12,840
The moment we've all been waiting for.

1022
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:16,799
Who will be María Enamorada?

1023
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,431
You look lovely.

1024
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:36,470
You've enchanted all Mexico
with your lovely eyes, warm and radiant.

1025
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:39,434
Sandra.

1026
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:44,829
Yesenia.

1027
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:46,754
Welcome.

1028
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,156
<i>You've worked hard to get here.</i>

1029
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:51,071
We're all aware of that.

1030
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:53,517
I must say,

1031
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:57,312
you look lovely.

1032
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:01,718
<i>You hear your name,</i>

1033
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,195
and time stands still.

1034
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,788
And each second seems to last

1035
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,078
<i>your whole life.</i>

1036
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,880
You are not María Enamorada.

1037
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:24,911
Because María Enamorada is...

1038
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,831
Sandra!

1039
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:30,915
Sandra is María Enamorada!

1040
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:38,757
<i>You never frigging win.</i>

1041
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:43,030
<i>It's funny because the best actress is me.</i>

1042
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:44,994
<i>Best of them all.</i>

1043
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:48,630
I act constantly.

1044
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:53,792
Every day. Non-stop.
And they never noticed.

1045
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,198
They never noticed.

1046
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:02,433
Those bastards.

1047
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:04,957
She was rooked! No shit.

1048
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:08,635
Crooks! They were bribed. Carlos won!

1049
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:13,471
- Let it all out.
- Cool it.

1050
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:20,036
We're gonna keep kicking ass.

1051
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:24,589
One day we'll be the winners.
We'll show the bastards.

1052
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:39,710
What a couple of losers.

1053
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:43,239
You're too much woman for them, fella.

1054
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:45,788
I liked the Indian squaw.

1055
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:49,197
- Genuine stuff.
- Sure, but no way she'd win.

1056
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:53,432
No leading man is gonna wanna kiss
one of those natives.

1057
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:56,830
At best she'd get the part of the maid.

1058
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:59,957
It's always the same
with those swarthy types.

1059
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,313
She couldn't have left!

1060
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:53,552
Well, she did, god damn it.
And your ass is swarthy.

1061
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:59,354
Go get Francisca for me. Quick!

1062
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,912
Thank you for your music!

1063
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:05,509
And now

1064
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:10,592
a big hand for the man behind the myth,

1065
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:12,352
Alejandro Mateos.

1066
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:15,475
Congratulations!

1067
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:20,190
Sandra, you're our winner,
but I have a surprise for you.

1068
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:24,356
Sandra, you won't be María Enamorada.

1069
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:28,196
You'll play the daughter
of María Enamorada.

1070
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:33,311
There's only one Enamorada,
and that's Eva Gallardo.

1071
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:41,070
Eva will not desert you, Mexico.

1072
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:45,199
Enamorada will be the same,
but now more than ever.

1073
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:47,232
More woman.

1074
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:52,792
You'll be reunited
with your long-lost daughter.

1075
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:55,515
Let's hear it for Eva Gallardo!

1076
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:12,793
This has been the search
for María Enamorada.

1077
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:16,117
<i>Till the next time.</i>

1078
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:26,872
Why are you here?

1079
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:32,390
To find you when you were done.

1080
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,313
Well, I'm done.

1081
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:02,834
It's snowing.

1082
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:07,438
They caught Satan.

1083
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:10,758
After the contest
people paid attention to me.

1084
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,595
<i>I was on TV. And someone turned him in.</i>
<i>He's behind bars.</i>

1085
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:17,191
<i>But lots more are still out there.</i>

1086
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:21,036
<i>The police aren't lifting a finger,</i>
<i>and don't plan to.</i>

1087
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:26,393
They jail innocent people to shut us up.

1088
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:29,270
And the list keeps growing.

1089
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:32,153
Jessica Cortes.

1090
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:34,712
Melissa Castillo.

1091
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,158
Nadia Mendoza.

1092
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:39,438
Regina Ramos.

1093
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:41,392
Orchidea Martínez.

1094
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,512
Daniela Beltrán.

1095
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:45,558
Anahí Trujillo.

1096
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:47,598
Susana Torres.

1097
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,393
Gladys Ovalle.

1098
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:01,912
God sends you signs.

1099
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:07,036
And mine was, why Mexico?
What I want is to be an international star.

1100
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:09,918
Straight to the top.

1101
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:12,153
You see it.

1102
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:16,158
And you go for it.

1103
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:19,916
This is Ted. My accent coach.

1104
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:40,275
I'm teaching them to read and write.

1105
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:45,910
I ordered the books in Zapotec.
They take a while to get here.

1106
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:51,188
Today we learn the future tense.

1107
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:55,955
I...

1108
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:58,555
Will...

1109
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,155
Be.

1110
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:04,149
Repeat.

1111
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:19,356
I got to play the slut.

1112
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,992
Funny, huh? A speaking part!

1113
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:32,678
We'll see what comes of it.
Nothing's ever sure.

1114
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:36,355
Like one day you have a friend,
and the next you don't.

1115
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:39,432
Or a job. Or...

1116
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:41,959
A secret.

1117
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:45,878
But you act as if it'll last forever.

1118
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:47,828
No choice.

1119
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:49,035
Jonathan.

1120
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,237
<i>I have a song for you.</i>

1121
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:54,554
- Don't sing to me.
<i>- Just one. You love it.</i>

1122
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:57,837
- You are so corny!
<i>- Just one.</i>

1123
01:35:58,120 --> 01:35:59,599
Okay. Just one.

1124
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,592
I announced it on TV.

1125
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:10,390
I'll be her godmother. Or her aunt.
Her mother, no way.

1126
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:13,349
You wanna make me mad?

1127
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,911
The report's in.

1128
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:28,316
What do we do about the rain?

1129
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,709
- Call it off?
- No, we shoot.

1130
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:35,158
Eva, we'll give you a few grey hairs.

1131
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:38,430
Grey hair? I'll tell make-up, sir.

1132
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:43,831
Let's kick ass. What else?

1133
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:55,509
Sound!

1134
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:00,829
Action!

1135
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:03,751
Good day to you, Enamorada.

1136
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:07,509
Cut!
