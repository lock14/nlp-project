1
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,363
There are some things
in this world so frightening,

2
00:00:52,365 --> 00:00:54,665
that we pretend
they don't exist.

3
00:00:54,665 --> 00:00:57,568
Stuff of nightmares.

4
00:00:57,568 --> 00:00:59,870
We tell ourselves,

5
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,171
''There's no such thing.''

6
00:01:02,171 --> 00:01:04,073
But the truth is,

7
00:01:04,073 --> 00:01:05,474
they're out there...

8
00:01:08,376 --> 00:01:09,878
...even closer than we fear.

9
00:03:12,778 --> 00:03:13,879
Silver bullets.

10
00:03:18,983 --> 00:03:20,284
Nice touch.

11
00:03:25,888 --> 00:03:27,290
So, caretaker.

12
00:03:30,092 --> 00:03:32,394
Looks like you're out of a job.

13
00:03:34,996 --> 00:03:36,197
You and your people

14
00:03:36,197 --> 00:03:38,899
have been defending
these pathetic creatures

15
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:40,801
for a long time.

16
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:44,203
But it'll all be over soon enough.

17
00:03:49,808 --> 00:03:53,010
We'll attack each of these camps

18
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,412
and destroy them.

19
00:03:55,913 --> 00:03:59,416
And this disgrace to our true nature
will be over forever.

20
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:02,818
So, what was on the tape?

21
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:04,820
You'll never find the boy
in time.

22
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:10,024
No.

23
00:04:11,926 --> 00:04:13,327
lt can't be.

24
00:04:13,327 --> 00:04:14,928
lt's already begun.

25
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,131
The legend is true.

26
00:04:22,134 --> 00:04:23,335
Where's the boy?

27
00:04:23,335 --> 00:04:24,736
Tell me!

28
00:04:24,736 --> 00:04:26,238
Not in this lifetime.

29
00:04:33,744 --> 00:04:35,545
Hurry. Gather your men.

30
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:37,847
We have four days till full moon.

31
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:39,749
Take this to Varek. He goes north.

32
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:41,150
Tell him there's no time to lose.

33
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,351
You find this boy
or it's the end of us.

34
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:50,858
You can see for yourself.

35
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:52,159
The boy is safe.

36
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,060
But with the red moon,

37
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,162
we should be ready for anything.

38
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,063
Just to make sure.

39
00:04:58,063 --> 00:04:59,865
And you be careful.

40
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:02,767
The red moon's powers
will be very strong.

41
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:04,769
And you'll have to lock down
till this is over.

42
00:05:07,371 --> 00:05:08,872
l gotta go.

43
00:05:08,872 --> 00:05:10,874
Good luck. Stay sharp.

44
00:05:13,276 --> 00:05:14,477
He's gonna make it.

45
00:05:16,278 --> 00:05:17,479
We all are.

46
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,981
This isn't a dream anymore.

47
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,884
Four more days.

48
00:05:25,186 --> 00:05:26,787
Well, that's the good news.

49
00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:29,589
Bad news is now you all
gotta spend the night downstairs.

50
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:42,749
lt's probably just a fuse.

51
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:43,950
l'll be right back.

52
00:07:47,702 --> 00:07:48,702
Ralph?

53
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:09,820
Ralph?

54
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:27,634
Oh, my God.

55
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,641
Tell me when, Varek,

56
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,942
and they're all dead.

57
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:47,350
So it's true?

58
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,851
The boy's alive.

59
00:08:50,052 --> 00:08:51,153
Where is he?

60
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:53,955
Don't hurt him!

61
00:08:53,955 --> 00:08:55,757
That's not what l want.

62
00:08:55,757 --> 00:08:57,158
lf you cooperate with us,

63
00:08:57,158 --> 00:08:59,560
then you will be spared,
along with your husband.

64
00:09:01,061 --> 00:09:02,262
lf you choose otherwise,

65
00:09:02,162 --> 00:09:05,165
then you will be forced
to watch him suffer in agony,

66
00:09:05,165 --> 00:09:06,866
allowing you one last
look at the life

67
00:09:06,866 --> 00:09:08,367
that you elected to end.

68
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:09,768
Do you understand?

69
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:19,176
Good.

70
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:20,977
Now...

71
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:23,279
where's the child?

72
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:27,082
We don't know.

73
00:09:28,283 --> 00:09:29,484
We never have.

74
00:09:29,484 --> 00:09:30,685
She's lyin'.

75
00:09:30,685 --> 00:09:32,187
They gotta know, Varek.

76
00:09:32,187 --> 00:09:34,789
You think we hadn't thought
of something like this?

77
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,591
Of someone like you?

78
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:41,794
You think you're a martyr.

79
00:09:43,596 --> 00:09:45,497
You might as well
be holding the blade.

80
00:09:56,206 --> 00:09:58,408
No! No! No!

81
00:10:09,017 --> 00:10:10,017
That's it?

82
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:12,720
You believe her?

83
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,622
lt doesn't make any sense.
lt's not possible, Varek.

84
00:10:15,622 --> 00:10:16,723
lt makes perfect sense.

85
00:10:17,824 --> 00:10:19,225
They can't tell us
what they don't know,

86
00:10:19,225 --> 00:10:20,726
no matter what we do to them.

87
00:10:21,727 --> 00:10:22,728
lt's foolproof.

88
00:10:22,728 --> 00:10:24,829
They're dying for some kid
they've never even seen?

89
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:25,930
They have faith.

90
00:10:27,532 --> 00:10:28,733
lt's all they need.

91
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:31,735
Think of something.
This kid is out there.

92
00:10:33,737 --> 00:10:35,939
l'd rather die than
go back to that.

93
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:38,240
We'll find the child.

94
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,742
There is no alternative.

95
00:10:42,544 --> 00:10:43,745
We'll find him, Sonja.

96
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,652
You can't even see the kid's face.

97
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,054
So that's how they did it.

98
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,257
Boosted morale
without risking a thing.

99
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:00,959
We're wasting our time, Varek.

100
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,261
We only have four more nights
to find this kid.

101
00:11:05,062 --> 00:11:06,063
Zo.

102
00:11:07,965 --> 00:11:08,965
Wait.

103
00:11:12,068 --> 00:11:13,369
You see that?

104
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:15,371
- What?
- Right there.

105
00:11:16,772 --> 00:11:17,973
Look at the mirror.

106
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:27,881
Huguenot.

107
00:11:29,182 --> 00:11:31,284
Come on, baby, breathe.

108
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:32,785
Please, just breathe.

109
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,891
Will, he can't breathe.

110
00:11:39,891 --> 00:11:42,893
l gave him his shot this morning.
l don't understand.

111
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:44,895
His inhaler doesn't help!

112
00:11:44,895 --> 00:11:46,896
He just keeps getting
worse and worse.

113
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:48,097
Rachel.

114
00:11:48,097 --> 00:11:49,498
lt's gonna be okay.

115
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,002
Tim, l want you to breathe deep...

116
00:11:55,603 --> 00:11:57,105
...and don't move.

117
00:11:57,105 --> 00:11:58,406
Come on, sweetie.

118
00:12:11,616 --> 00:12:12,617
Thank you.

119
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:17,721
Man, this stuff smells like crap.

120
00:12:19,723 --> 00:12:20,824
Yeah.

121
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:44,043
Hey, baby.

122
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:45,744
You okay?

123
00:12:47,646 --> 00:12:49,647
You want to see something freaky?

124
00:12:56,353 --> 00:12:57,854
lsn't that awesome?

125
00:13:07,762 --> 00:13:09,463
Did you have another bad dream?

126
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:11,966
No, l'm fine.

127
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,672
Oh, come here, you.

128
00:13:19,672 --> 00:13:21,373
Let's snuggle.

129
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:24,976
l love you, Mom.

130
00:13:24,976 --> 00:13:26,477
l love you, too, baby.

131
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:06,110
Everything all right?

132
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,211
l was worried when
you weren't there this morning.

133
00:14:08,211 --> 00:14:09,512
Tim had another attack.

134
00:14:09,512 --> 00:14:10,813
A bad one.

135
00:14:10,813 --> 00:14:11,814
He's all right now.
He's sleeping.

136
00:14:11,814 --> 00:14:14,116
So is Rachel. She was up
most of the night.

137
00:14:16,518 --> 00:14:17,519
The, um...

138
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,823
The moon...is
getting very powerful.

139
00:14:22,823 --> 00:14:24,124
This may get worse.

140
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:26,126
Well, thank God for you, Will.

141
00:14:26,126 --> 00:14:27,527
You've always been there for us.

142
00:14:27,527 --> 00:14:28,828
l don't know what we'd
do without you.

143
00:14:28,828 --> 00:14:30,730
lt's all in a day's work.

144
00:14:40,738 --> 00:14:41,739
Hey.

145
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,842
Tim looks well.

146
00:14:47,443 --> 00:14:48,444
Yeah.

147
00:14:48,444 --> 00:14:50,446
He gets sick
and he gets better.

148
00:14:50,446 --> 00:14:51,747
lt's his whole life.

149
00:14:53,848 --> 00:14:55,750
He comforts me.

150
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,851
Jonas.

151
00:14:59,453 --> 00:15:00,854
What's wrong, Rachel?

152
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:04,557
There's something
l have to tell you.

153
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:08,060
lt's time for me and Tim to leave.

154
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,762
We have to.

155
00:15:10,762 --> 00:15:12,163
l have to learn to be a mother.

156
00:15:12,163 --> 00:15:14,565
A good mother.

157
00:15:14,565 --> 00:15:17,768
Figure out what l want to do
with the rest of my life.

158
00:15:17,768 --> 00:15:20,670
You guys have raised Tim.
l haven't.

159
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,973
l'm so goddamned dependent
on everyone here.

160
00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:27,176
l have to learn to stand
on my own two feet.

161
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,278
He's been dead
over 13 years now, Jonas.

162
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:32,580
What progress have l made?

163
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,781
His ghost is all around me,

164
00:15:33,781 --> 00:15:36,984
every time l look
at you, Nana, Katherine.

165
00:15:38,785 --> 00:15:40,086
l still see him.

166
00:15:40,086 --> 00:15:41,687
Come on, Rachel.
Don't fool yourself.

167
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:46,191
My brother's ghost is gonna be
with you wherever you go.

168
00:15:46,191 --> 00:15:47,892
So you need to be strong

169
00:15:47,892 --> 00:15:49,694
despite that.

170
00:15:49,694 --> 00:15:50,795
He'd want you to.

171
00:15:52,296 --> 00:15:53,697
l'm sorry, Jonas.

172
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:57,300
l've already made my decision.

173
00:15:59,802 --> 00:16:00,803
Hey, Doak!

174
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:05,207
Okay.

175
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:09,810
What up, dog?

176
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,913
You know.
Gotta give 'em what they want.

177
00:16:12,913 --> 00:16:14,514
What's that, D?

178
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:16,516
l don't know. Let me see
what l got in here.

179
00:16:17,617 --> 00:16:20,719
- Uh, oh. New DVD.
- Yes!

180
00:16:23,922 --> 00:16:25,323
- Morning.
- Morning.

181
00:16:25,323 --> 00:16:26,724
- Good morning, Rachel.
- Hi, Mom.

182
00:16:26,724 --> 00:16:28,726
What's everyone doing here?
Did l miss something?

183
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:30,127
- Mail.
- Muffins.

184
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:34,631
Oh, you're forgetting your nametag.

185
00:16:35,531 --> 00:16:36,732
- Oh, shoot.
- Here.

186
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:39,234
Thanks, Nana.

187
00:16:39,234 --> 00:16:40,735
Come on, Kat. Let's go hang.

188
00:16:40,735 --> 00:16:42,037
Totally.

189
00:16:43,338 --> 00:16:44,739
Be cool, fool.

190
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:49,543
Ooh! Aw, shoot.

191
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,446
This piece of track keeps catching.

192
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:56,248
Uh, when did we start
wielding blades?

193
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,749
Oh, a few days ago.

194
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,851
What?

195
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:01,452
Mom gave it to me.

196
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:03,254
- All right.
- She was saving it for my birthday.

197
00:17:03,254 --> 00:17:05,356
l caught her trying
to hide it in her jewelry box.

198
00:17:06,757 --> 00:17:08,658
- So l got it early.
- Nice.

199
00:17:08,658 --> 00:17:09,859
Let me see that.

200
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:10,960
Oh, sure.

201
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:14,163
lt looks so, uh, used.

202
00:17:15,664 --> 00:17:17,065
lt was my dad's.

203
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:22,269
Hey, look what
the cat dragged in.

204
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,171
- Hey, Adam.
- Baby.

205
00:17:25,172 --> 00:17:26,172
Hey, babe.

206
00:17:30,776 --> 00:17:31,777
How you feelin', big guy?

207
00:17:31,777 --> 00:17:32,878
l'm hungry.

208
00:17:32,878 --> 00:17:34,479
All right. He said it.

209
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:35,980
Let's go get some breakfast.

210
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:38,883
- Easy.
- Why does he have to do that?

211
00:17:40,384 --> 00:17:43,086
Hey. Heard you had
a bit of a scare last night.

212
00:17:43,086 --> 00:17:44,688
How do you feel?

213
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,789
Huge. Check that out.

214
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:48,090
Check this out.

215
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,491
Thanks, Uncle Jonas.

216
00:17:49,491 --> 00:17:50,692
Early birthday present.

217
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:52,794
Wow, Dad. ls that a smile?

218
00:17:53,795 --> 00:17:55,496
Adam taking care of you?

219
00:17:57,298 --> 00:17:58,299
Come on.

220
00:18:00,701 --> 00:18:02,902
How about that moon last night?

221
00:18:02,902 --> 00:18:05,104
lt was pretty wild, huh?

222
00:18:05,104 --> 00:18:06,906
Shoot. l'm late.

223
00:18:06,906 --> 00:18:08,707
So, you'll drop Timmy at the store?

224
00:18:08,707 --> 00:18:09,708
We'll be there.

225
00:18:30,725 --> 00:18:31,926
Wave to Courtney.

226
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:37,130
Hey, Adam! Rachel!

227
00:18:38,331 --> 00:18:39,732
How's Tim?

228
00:18:39,732 --> 00:18:40,933
All better?

229
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:43,335
He's fine. Thanks.

230
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:45,737
Good news.

231
00:18:52,343 --> 00:18:54,845
Tim had an attack last night.

232
00:18:54,745 --> 00:18:55,946
Last night.

233
00:18:55,946 --> 00:18:57,747
We can't even sneeze in this town

234
00:18:57,747 --> 00:18:59,949
without anyone knowing our business.

235
00:18:59,949 --> 00:19:01,450
lsn't that weird?

236
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,852
l mean, it's not normal. lt's not.

237
00:22:10,004 --> 00:22:11,405
We're not here right now.

238
00:22:11,305 --> 00:22:13,206
Leave a message and we'll
get right back to you.

239
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,807
Thanks.

240
00:22:14,807 --> 00:22:16,209
Hey, guys, it's me.

241
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,610
Where are you?

242
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,911
l thought you'd be here by now.

243
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:21,313
lt's getting late. Um...

244
00:22:21,313 --> 00:22:22,714
Where are you?

245
00:22:26,117 --> 00:22:27,818
Nana?

246
00:22:27,818 --> 00:22:29,820
Do you think the moon
will be red again tonight?

247
00:22:31,921 --> 00:22:33,022
Yeah, maybe.

248
00:22:34,323 --> 00:22:35,825
Really?
What makes it red?

249
00:22:35,825 --> 00:22:38,527
lt's getting late.
Let's just get you to the store.

250
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,241
Nana?

251
00:23:21,762 --> 00:23:22,763
Come on.

252
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,780
All we want is the boy.

253
00:23:58,492 --> 00:23:59,493
Did you hear guns?

254
00:24:18,408 --> 00:24:19,709
Nana, stay down!

255
00:24:30,718 --> 00:24:33,821
l'll explain later. Right now,
learn how to load a gun.

256
00:24:36,223 --> 00:24:37,524
Adam, what are you doing?

257
00:24:37,524 --> 00:24:38,725
We need to move now.

258
00:24:39,926 --> 00:24:40,826
Timothy!

259
00:24:59,742 --> 00:25:00,743
Quick! Get down!

260
00:25:10,751 --> 00:25:11,751
Dad!

261
00:25:17,656 --> 00:25:18,957
Head straight for the saddle shop.

262
00:25:19,258 --> 00:25:20,759
Stay there until l come for you.

263
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:22,760
l'm not leaving you, Nana.

264
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,861
Do as l say.

265
00:25:24,662 --> 00:25:25,663
Go!

266
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:45,979
Go! Get the boy!

267
00:26:05,695 --> 00:26:07,097
Mom!

268
00:26:07,097 --> 00:26:08,798
Oh, my God.

269
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:09,799
Are you okay?

270
00:26:39,123 --> 00:26:40,624
Don't move until l tell you.

271
00:26:45,528 --> 00:26:46,429
Now we need...

272
00:26:50,832 --> 00:26:52,133
...to get to my garage.

273
00:26:56,637 --> 00:26:57,638
Trust me.

274
00:27:19,455 --> 00:27:20,456
Adam.

275
00:27:21,457 --> 00:27:22,658
They're on us.

276
00:27:22,658 --> 00:27:24,059
Where's Jonas?

277
00:27:29,263 --> 00:27:30,564
Go. Let's move!

278
00:27:30,564 --> 00:27:32,166
Come on! Come on!

279
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:34,568
Come on.

280
00:27:34,568 --> 00:27:35,769
Give me your hand.

281
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:36,870
Give me your hand, Rachel.

282
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:38,771
Come on!

283
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:01,790
Adam, get her in the truck!

284
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,791
Give me your hand!

285
00:28:04,993 --> 00:28:05,793
Mom!

286
00:28:05,793 --> 00:28:07,194
Get out of here!

287
00:28:21,106 --> 00:28:22,207
l can't believe...

288
00:28:22,207 --> 00:28:23,408
Anyone else hit?

289
00:28:23,908 --> 00:28:25,009
Get the bandages.

290
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:26,710
Okay.

291
00:28:30,713 --> 00:28:31,914
Wait, let me see this.

292
00:28:31,914 --> 00:28:33,115
Put some pressure.
Put pressure.

293
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:52,031
Nana! lt's Nana!

294
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:54,133
How did they find us,
Jonas? How?

295
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:55,634
What the hell is happening?

296
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:57,836
They want Timothy.

297
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,237
What are you talking about?

298
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,038
They want to kill him, Rachel.

299
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:03,240
And they're not gonna
stop until he's dead.

300
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,842
Why would anyone want
to kill Tim? He's just a boy.

301
00:29:05,842 --> 00:29:07,043
ln three days,

302
00:29:07,043 --> 00:29:08,744
on a full moon,

303
00:29:08,744 --> 00:29:10,746
something's gonna
happen to Timothy.

304
00:29:10,746 --> 00:29:12,748
Something they can't allow.

305
00:29:17,752 --> 00:29:19,853
l'll find them.

306
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:21,054
You know that.

307
00:29:21,054 --> 00:29:23,556
You're not making any sense.

308
00:29:23,556 --> 00:29:25,358
We're cursed.

309
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:28,761
We kept you in the dark
all these years

310
00:29:28,761 --> 00:29:30,062
because it was the best way
to prevent them

311
00:29:30,062 --> 00:29:32,163
from finding Timothy...ever.

312
00:29:32,163 --> 00:29:34,065
And we kept him safe, Rachel.

313
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:36,667
For 13 years, we kept him safe.

314
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:37,668
Don't.

315
00:29:47,576 --> 00:29:49,277
We call ourselves Skinwalkers.

316
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:53,281
l don't understand.

317
00:29:53,281 --> 00:29:54,782
You would call us werewolves.

318
00:29:54,782 --> 00:29:56,383
Who were they?

319
00:29:56,383 --> 00:29:57,784
Skinwalkers.

320
00:29:59,085 --> 00:30:00,487
But not like us.

321
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:04,790
lt's really quite simple.

322
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,092
We want the curse to end.
They don't.

323
00:30:07,092 --> 00:30:08,993
Why do they want me?

324
00:30:08,993 --> 00:30:10,595
'Cause you're the only one

325
00:30:10,595 --> 00:30:14,598
who has the power to end
the curse forever.

326
00:30:14,598 --> 00:30:15,999
You're special, Timothy.

327
00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:18,801
You have your mother's blood

328
00:30:18,801 --> 00:30:20,603
and ours.

329
00:30:20,603 --> 00:30:21,804
Nana was one of us.

330
00:30:21,804 --> 00:30:23,305
So was your father.

331
00:30:23,305 --> 00:30:24,006
No.

332
00:30:24,606 --> 00:30:26,007
That's impossible. Not my husband.

333
00:30:26,007 --> 00:30:27,509
Pull this thing over.
We're getting out.

334
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:28,710
- Rachel, please!
- Don't you get it?

335
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,911
l don't believe you.
You're no better--

336
00:30:31,712 --> 00:30:33,113
Mom!

337
00:30:33,113 --> 00:30:34,514
lt's gonna be okay.

338
00:30:34,514 --> 00:30:35,615
l promise.

339
00:31:31,761 --> 00:31:33,262
Don't worry. She's safe.

340
00:31:33,262 --> 00:31:35,464
They're locked down.

341
00:31:35,464 --> 00:31:37,165
She needs to see it to believe it.

342
00:31:38,867 --> 00:31:40,368
You're not like them.

343
00:31:40,368 --> 00:31:41,969
l'm just a friend.

344
00:31:41,969 --> 00:31:44,071
l knew your father
when he was your age,

345
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:46,273
and Jonas and l go way back.

346
00:31:46,273 --> 00:31:48,274
My people have been taking
care of these people

347
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:50,376
for a long time.

348
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:51,877
There's a legend,

349
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:53,078
a belief,

350
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,479
that if a child who's--

351
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:55,780
A half breed?

352
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:58,883
Something like that.

353
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:01,085
And if he lives to be 13 years old,

354
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,486
there's gonna be a red moon,

355
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:04,487
which is a signal to all Skinwalkers

356
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:07,590
that the prophecy will
be fulfilled at midnight

357
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,892
on the day of your 13th birthday.

358
00:32:11,693 --> 00:32:14,596
When they turn, the craving
for human blood is so intense,

359
00:32:14,596 --> 00:32:16,697
that if they break free and feed,

360
00:32:16,697 --> 00:32:18,599
they will become the beast forever.

361
00:32:20,701 --> 00:32:22,102
The ones trying to kill me,

362
00:32:22,102 --> 00:32:23,503
they don't want the curse to end?

363
00:32:23,503 --> 00:32:25,104
To them, it's not a curse.

364
00:32:26,105 --> 00:32:28,707
The lust and desire
to consume human blood

365
00:32:28,707 --> 00:32:30,809
is so overwhelming for them,

366
00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:32,811
it's like drugs to an addict.

367
00:32:41,317 --> 00:32:43,419
The first Skinwalkers
were Native American.

368
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,621
They believed that the power
of the wolf was a gift,

369
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:48,323
but it mutated and...

370
00:32:48,323 --> 00:32:50,525
many couldn't control
the lust for power,

371
00:32:50,525 --> 00:32:53,527
couldn't fight the beast
inside them.

372
00:32:53,527 --> 00:32:55,129
What makes you think l can?

373
00:32:57,431 --> 00:32:58,832
lf l live through this,

374
00:32:58,832 --> 00:33:01,534
what is it that l'm supposed
to be able to do exactly?

375
00:33:03,736 --> 00:33:04,737
l don't know.

376
00:34:26,503 --> 00:34:27,804
Jonas.

377
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,522
Here you go, little girl.

378
00:34:49,522 --> 00:34:50,923
- Thanks, LJ.
- Anytime.

379
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,226
l'll take your money.
How much was it, anyway?

380
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:58,729
Come to Daddy, baby.

381
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,130
Keep dreaming.

382
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,932
- Yeah.
- Hey.

383
00:35:03,934 --> 00:35:05,735
So, are we gonna play some pool?

384
00:35:05,735 --> 00:35:06,736
Let's play, baby.

385
00:35:06,736 --> 00:35:07,837
Oh, yeah.
We're gonna play, all right.

386
00:35:07,837 --> 00:35:09,438
Hey! Get your hands off me!

387
00:35:09,438 --> 00:35:10,839
How about two against one?

388
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:13,241
- No!
- Party now. Yeah!

389
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:16,244
Get off me! Get off of me!

390
00:35:20,947 --> 00:35:23,349
Hey, sweetheart.
You want some of this?

391
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:30,255
What the--

392
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:52,971
Please forgive us.

393
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,481
We're refueled.

394
00:38:06,782 --> 00:38:08,684
l'm gonna head for the stronghold.

395
00:38:09,685 --> 00:38:10,686
All right.

396
00:38:50,718 --> 00:38:52,420
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

397
00:38:53,721 --> 00:38:55,522
You know, you might even
like it if you try it.

398
00:38:57,023 --> 00:38:58,925
Not in this lifetime.

399
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:14,938
Where the hell
are we gonna go?

400
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:17,440
Follow the leader.

401
00:39:20,743 --> 00:39:22,044
Zo.

402
00:39:22,044 --> 00:39:23,545
Yeah?

403
00:39:23,545 --> 00:39:24,746
Let's get it done.

404
00:39:51,768 --> 00:39:53,469
l'm the same man, Rachel.

405
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,371
No.

406
00:39:57,072 --> 00:39:58,373
You're not.

407
00:39:58,373 --> 00:39:59,975
Not to me.

408
00:39:59,975 --> 00:40:02,377
You've been living like
this your whole life?

409
00:40:02,377 --> 00:40:03,778
Every month?

410
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:06,080
What about them?

411
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,281
The ones coming after us.

412
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:08,381
When they change, do they--

413
00:40:08,381 --> 00:40:10,984
They hunt and they kill.

414
00:40:10,984 --> 00:40:12,385
They're addicted to blood.

415
00:40:12,385 --> 00:40:14,586
Once you feed, you can't go back.

416
00:40:14,586 --> 00:40:15,888
Those beasts killed my husband

417
00:40:15,787 --> 00:40:17,489
and now they're after my son?

418
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,792
How is a 13-year-old boy
gonna end all of this?

419
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:23,594
He's special.

420
00:40:26,296 --> 00:40:27,897
The nightmares, the asthma...

421
00:40:28,698 --> 00:40:29,999
Timothy...

422
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:32,701
Timothy's body is at war with itself.

423
00:40:32,701 --> 00:40:34,403
And he needs you.

424
00:40:34,403 --> 00:40:36,104
We need you.

425
00:40:36,905 --> 00:40:38,006
So, what now?

426
00:40:40,307 --> 00:40:42,209
How do we keep my son safe?

427
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:45,812
Now we keep together,
and we stay out of sight.

428
00:40:47,413 --> 00:40:48,714
Now there's just two more days.

429
00:40:48,714 --> 00:40:50,816
We're so close, Rachel.

430
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,721
- Hey.
- Hey.

431
00:40:57,722 --> 00:40:59,123
What is it, baby?

432
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,624
Mom, l...

433
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,126
l don't feel so good.

434
00:41:09,932 --> 00:41:12,734
lt's okay, baby. l'm here.

435
00:41:12,734 --> 00:41:14,635
lt's gonna be okay, Tim.

436
00:41:14,635 --> 00:41:16,237
What happened?

437
00:41:16,237 --> 00:41:17,838
You passed out.

438
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:20,840
You'll be back
in the game in no time.

439
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,941
You'll be good.

440
00:41:26,745 --> 00:41:28,046
So when you get the nurse...

441
00:41:30,348 --> 00:41:31,749
... l want you to do a walk around.

442
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,952
l don't know this place.

443
00:41:34,952 --> 00:41:36,954
l don't want any surprises.

444
00:41:36,954 --> 00:41:38,855
All right, l'll do it.

445
00:41:39,756 --> 00:41:42,058
What is going on upstairs?

446
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:44,760
Damn it.

447
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,761
Breathe.

448
00:41:47,462 --> 00:41:48,763
Tim's gonna make it.

449
00:41:48,763 --> 00:41:50,064
He always does.

450
00:41:51,265 --> 00:41:53,067
He's stronger than
all of us put together.

451
00:41:54,168 --> 00:41:55,168
Yeah.

452
00:41:56,169 --> 00:41:57,670
l know that.

453
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:59,672
And l believe that.

454
00:41:59,672 --> 00:42:00,773
l just...

455
00:42:02,474 --> 00:42:04,576
l'm sick of looking over my shoulder

456
00:42:04,576 --> 00:42:05,877
and not knowing who to trust.

457
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:09,080
How do you feel, young man?

458
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,481
Better.

459
00:42:10,481 --> 00:42:12,282
- Now that you're here.
- Tim.

460
00:42:12,282 --> 00:42:13,784
lt's fine. lt's cute.

461
00:42:13,784 --> 00:42:15,685
Cute, huh?

462
00:42:15,685 --> 00:42:17,687
You had all the lab technicians
scratching their heads.

463
00:42:17,687 --> 00:42:18,888
Let me guess.

464
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:21,990
l'm a werewolf.

465
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,692
Not quite.

466
00:42:23,692 --> 00:42:25,493
But he does have
a very rare blood type.

467
00:42:25,493 --> 00:42:26,894
Not only that,
but his white blood count

468
00:42:26,894 --> 00:42:28,596
was off the charts.

469
00:42:28,596 --> 00:42:30,897
Uh, he gets that from me.
l'm AB negative.

470
00:42:30,897 --> 00:42:32,699
That's not it.
What about his father?

471
00:42:35,401 --> 00:42:36,702
That's a tough one.

472
00:42:36,702 --> 00:42:38,003
Well, we're not sure.

473
00:42:38,003 --> 00:42:38,904
Okay.

474
00:42:40,505 --> 00:42:42,307
You have some pretty strong blood

475
00:42:42,307 --> 00:42:43,908
running through you.

476
00:42:47,911 --> 00:42:49,813
Adam.

477
00:42:49,813 --> 00:42:51,915
We are so close.

478
00:42:51,915 --> 00:42:55,417
Before we know it,
our lives are gonna be our own.

479
00:42:55,417 --> 00:42:58,720
We can be
whatever we want to be.

480
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,221
Okay?

481
00:43:01,222 --> 00:43:02,323
We're so close.

482
00:43:04,225 --> 00:43:05,526
l want to be your better half.

483
00:43:05,526 --> 00:43:06,827
Well, it's long hours.

484
00:43:06,827 --> 00:43:08,428
Yeah.

485
00:43:08,428 --> 00:43:10,830
What's the pay?

486
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:12,631
lt's more about the benefits.

487
00:43:24,241 --> 00:43:26,543
How long before
we can be on our way?

488
00:43:28,544 --> 00:43:29,745
Let me go talk to the doctor.

489
00:43:29,745 --> 00:43:31,547
Don't be a stranger.

490
00:43:32,748 --> 00:43:33,749
Thank you.

491
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:39,754
What? l'm almost 13, you know.

492
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:57,968
How is he?

493
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,170
He's doing okay. We'll be
out of here in no time.

494
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:02,772
Adam, get to the roof.

495
00:44:02,772 --> 00:44:04,674
You might see something we can't.

496
00:44:04,674 --> 00:44:05,975
Kat, you take the back entrance.

497
00:44:05,975 --> 00:44:07,076
l'm gonna stay here.

498
00:44:08,077 --> 00:44:09,378
Mom?

499
00:44:10,078 --> 00:44:12,380
l want to get out of here.

500
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,981
We need to leave.

501
00:44:13,981 --> 00:44:16,984
l know. Doak's gone
to find someone.

502
00:44:16,984 --> 00:44:18,085
lt'll be a minute.

503
00:44:21,588 --> 00:44:23,289
Car accident. Head trauma.

504
00:45:03,822 --> 00:45:05,924
Let's take a look.

505
00:45:29,743 --> 00:45:30,544
Jonas.

506
00:45:30,544 --> 00:45:32,345
Bring the RV around now.

507
00:45:52,662 --> 00:45:53,763
Excuse me.

508
00:45:53,763 --> 00:45:56,565
Can you get a doctor, please?
We'd like to leave.

509
00:45:56,565 --> 00:45:57,766
Hey, what are you doing?

510
00:45:57,766 --> 00:45:59,367
Mom!

511
00:46:10,076 --> 00:46:12,178
No! No!

512
00:46:17,782 --> 00:46:19,283
lt's time to die.

513
00:46:19,283 --> 00:46:20,384
No!

514
00:46:24,788 --> 00:46:25,989
Tim, get up!

515
00:46:25,989 --> 00:46:28,091
Go, Timmy, go! Go!
Get off!

516
00:46:28,091 --> 00:46:29,992
You okay? Come on, get up!
Get up, Mom!

517
00:46:35,296 --> 00:46:36,798
Come on!

518
00:46:36,798 --> 00:46:38,399
Let's go. Come on!

519
00:46:47,306 --> 00:46:48,307
Hey!

520
00:47:07,523 --> 00:47:08,724
No!

521
00:47:09,624 --> 00:47:10,925
Get ready, Doak!

522
00:47:13,728 --> 00:47:15,529
Now! Go! Go! Go!

523
00:47:15,529 --> 00:47:16,730
Move, move, move!

524
00:47:17,731 --> 00:47:18,732
Move! Move! Move!

525
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:26,738
Rachel!

526
00:47:32,343 --> 00:47:33,344
No!

527
00:47:37,747 --> 00:47:40,049
- lt's okay.
-No! No!

528
00:47:43,552 --> 00:47:44,553
Come here.

529
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:47,555
Come on! ln the truck!

530
00:47:47,555 --> 00:47:49,457
- Take him.
- Come on! Come on!

531
00:48:00,266 --> 00:48:01,166
Jonas.

532
00:48:03,768 --> 00:48:05,670
Let's stop all of this...

533
00:48:06,871 --> 00:48:08,172
...brother.

534
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:12,776
Cover me, Will.

535
00:48:16,579 --> 00:48:17,780
Let her go, Caleb.

536
00:48:26,187 --> 00:48:27,188
Caleb?

537
00:48:46,803 --> 00:48:48,805
Don't make me do something
l don't want to do.

538
00:48:50,406 --> 00:48:51,707
Join me.

539
00:48:51,707 --> 00:48:53,909
We're one and the same.

540
00:48:53,909 --> 00:48:55,711
l'm nothing like you.

541
00:48:55,711 --> 00:48:58,013
l am what l was meant to be.

542
00:48:59,814 --> 00:49:01,515
You live a lie.

543
00:49:03,117 --> 00:49:04,718
You were wrong.

544
00:49:04,718 --> 00:49:07,520
l know what you're feeling. Trust me.

545
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:09,922
Trust you?

546
00:49:13,725 --> 00:49:16,928
You're killing
fellow human beings.

547
00:49:16,928 --> 00:49:19,930
l am not human.

548
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:23,834
And l will not risk spending
the rest of my days as one.

549
00:49:25,935 --> 00:49:28,537
Diseased and flawed.

550
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,741
We're better than that.

551
00:49:34,242 --> 00:49:35,543
Let her go, Caleb.

552
00:49:37,745 --> 00:49:38,746
Let her go.

553
00:49:38,746 --> 00:49:40,948
l'll make you a deal.

554
00:49:40,948 --> 00:49:43,950
Katherine for the boy.

555
00:49:45,151 --> 00:49:48,854
My daughter for your son.

556
00:49:55,259 --> 00:49:56,260
What?

557
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,862
What the hell's
he talkin' about, Varek?

558
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:00,664
No.

559
00:50:18,178 --> 00:50:19,279
Screw this!

560
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:36,493
You told me he was dead,
Uncle Jonas.

561
00:50:36,493 --> 00:50:38,795
You all told me that.

562
00:50:38,795 --> 00:50:41,297
You all lied to me.

563
00:50:41,297 --> 00:50:42,698
You said he was dead!

564
00:50:42,698 --> 00:50:44,499
No! Mom!

565
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,501
They've got her.

566
00:50:48,102 --> 00:50:51,005
Oh, my God, Jonas!
They've got Kat!

567
00:51:12,222 --> 00:51:13,823
How you holdin' up, kiddo?

568
00:51:25,433 --> 00:51:26,834
l thought he was dead.

569
00:51:31,437 --> 00:51:32,839
Well, you were wrong.

570
00:51:35,141 --> 00:51:37,242
Now he's trying to kill my son.

571
00:51:41,045 --> 00:51:42,547
His son.

572
00:51:47,651 --> 00:51:49,452
We have to keep on.

573
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:12,471
She was your wife?

574
00:52:12,471 --> 00:52:13,672
lt was another life.

575
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,373
And that was your son?

576
00:52:15,373 --> 00:52:16,975
l didn't know.

577
00:52:18,576 --> 00:52:20,077
lt changes nothing.

578
00:52:20,077 --> 00:52:21,979
lt changes everything.

579
00:52:21,979 --> 00:52:24,781
That kid has to die.

580
00:52:24,881 --> 00:52:26,282
You know,
Sonja's right, Varek.

581
00:52:26,282 --> 00:52:27,683
This is screwed up.
That boy has to die!

582
00:52:27,683 --> 00:52:29,285
l know.

583
00:52:29,285 --> 00:52:31,687
l don't care whose kid it is.

584
00:52:31,687 --> 00:52:32,888
You can't hesitate.

585
00:52:32,888 --> 00:52:34,889
You shut your mouth.

586
00:52:34,889 --> 00:52:37,191
You question my resolve?

587
00:52:37,191 --> 00:52:38,792
That boy has no father.

588
00:52:40,394 --> 00:52:41,895
And l have no son.

589
00:53:07,215 --> 00:53:08,517
Jonas.

590
00:53:08,517 --> 00:53:11,119
This is our best chance, Adam.

591
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,020
Will and l know this place.
lt's safe.

592
00:53:13,821 --> 00:53:15,422
We'll be able to wait it out here.

593
00:53:15,422 --> 00:53:16,823
We can protect him here.

594
00:53:16,823 --> 00:53:18,825
Tell me she isn't worth it.

595
00:53:20,026 --> 00:53:22,428
Tell me she isn't worth
going back for.

596
00:53:30,534 --> 00:53:31,836
Why are you doing this?

597
00:53:36,039 --> 00:53:38,141
He knows he's got
my only weakness.

598
00:53:38,141 --> 00:53:40,743
That's why she's still alive, Adam.

599
00:53:40,743 --> 00:53:42,144
And that's why we can't go back,

600
00:53:42,144 --> 00:53:43,245
because that's
what he's counting on.

601
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:50,751
They're gonna torture
her mercilessly...

602
00:53:50,751 --> 00:53:52,753
Please don't.

603
00:53:52,753 --> 00:53:54,854
Well, this should be interesting.

604
00:53:54,854 --> 00:53:57,356
...and you know she won't break.

605
00:53:58,457 --> 00:53:59,958
Can you live with that?

606
00:54:05,763 --> 00:54:07,164
Neither can l.

607
00:54:08,565 --> 00:54:11,268
lt's just one more day, Adam,
and all this will be over.

608
00:54:11,268 --> 00:54:13,970
Everything we believe in
lives in Timothy.

609
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:15,971
Everything l believe in is out there.

610
00:54:15,971 --> 00:54:17,773
She's gone, Adam.

611
00:54:17,773 --> 00:54:19,775
Now, if you go back,
it'll be the end of us.

612
00:54:22,076 --> 00:54:23,578
Jonas.

613
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:25,579
We're as safe
as we're gonna get.

614
00:54:25,579 --> 00:54:26,980
Time to lock down.

615
00:54:27,781 --> 00:54:29,482
All right.

616
00:54:30,884 --> 00:54:33,786
Adam, you first. Let's go.

617
00:54:33,786 --> 00:54:36,588
The red moon is gonna be
even stronger tonight.

618
00:55:50,749 --> 00:55:51,950
Adam.

619
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:58,455
Adam, l want you to find
some higher ground

620
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:00,657
and keep your eyes peeled.

621
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:01,758
Adam.

622
00:57:07,411 --> 00:57:09,713
Get Timothy. We're leaving now.

623
00:57:09,713 --> 00:57:11,815
We're no longer safe here.

624
00:57:13,016 --> 00:57:14,417
How did he become one of them?

625
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,422
The night of the attack,
we thought he was dead.

626
00:57:22,723 --> 00:57:24,525
But we were wrong.

627
00:57:24,525 --> 00:57:26,326
Now, he must have survived
and he must have hunted,

628
00:57:26,326 --> 00:57:27,427
'cause now he's one of them.

629
00:57:27,427 --> 00:57:29,429
Jonas, it's Caleb.

630
00:57:29,429 --> 00:57:31,130
My husband. Your brother!

631
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:34,133
The Caleb that you loved
died that night.

632
00:57:34,133 --> 00:57:36,735
He is not dead.

633
00:57:36,735 --> 00:57:38,937
How could you lie to me
all these years?

634
00:57:38,937 --> 00:57:41,239
l did it to protect you.

635
00:57:41,239 --> 00:57:43,040
Now, he's taken Katherine.

636
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,742
You don't think
that l feel any of that?

637
00:57:45,742 --> 00:57:46,843
Do you?

638
00:57:48,144 --> 00:57:49,946
l'm not like you, Jonas.

639
00:57:49,946 --> 00:57:52,047
Any of you. Remember?

640
00:57:54,549 --> 00:57:57,152
l don't have a beast inside of me.

641
00:57:57,152 --> 00:57:58,753
Well, you better find it,

642
00:57:58,753 --> 00:58:01,355
or your son will die.

643
00:58:02,356 --> 00:58:03,757
Jonas!

644
00:58:05,558 --> 00:58:06,759
He found her.

645
00:58:24,073 --> 00:58:27,776
l told you not to go.
Now You've led them to us.

646
00:58:28,677 --> 00:58:30,879
l didn't see anyone.

647
00:58:38,485 --> 00:58:40,387
Everybody in the truck.

648
00:58:41,388 --> 00:58:42,689
We gotta go now.

649
00:58:49,694 --> 00:58:51,095
Tim?

650
00:58:51,095 --> 00:58:52,797
You okay, baby?

651
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:02,405
l couldn't believe
that it was him, Daddy.

652
00:59:04,306 --> 00:59:06,108
He looked so different.

653
00:59:09,811 --> 00:59:13,314
He...He wanted to know
where we were headed.

654
00:59:15,715 --> 00:59:19,018
The others
wanted me dead, but...

655
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,521
...he wouldn't allow it.

656
00:59:25,523 --> 00:59:27,425
l guess he saved my life.

657
00:59:29,427 --> 00:59:30,928
They're gonna be on our tail now.

658
00:59:32,329 --> 00:59:33,830
Hopefully we can make up
some time tonight.

659
00:59:35,832 --> 00:59:37,733
l'm sorry, Jonas.

660
00:59:37,733 --> 00:59:39,034
l couldn't leave her.

661
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:40,436
Yeah, l know.

662
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:46,641
l love you.

663
01:00:17,866 --> 01:00:18,767
lt's all right.
lt's okay.

664
01:00:18,767 --> 01:00:21,569
lt's okay, sweetheart.

665
01:00:21,569 --> 01:00:23,471
We'll talk about it in the morning.

666
01:00:23,471 --> 01:00:25,072
l'll finish with Kat.

667
01:00:25,072 --> 01:00:26,773
You two get yourselves locked up.

668
01:00:26,773 --> 01:00:28,174
She's gonna need some time.

669
01:00:28,174 --> 01:00:29,776
l'm sorry.

670
01:00:29,776 --> 01:00:32,278
l just don't remember.

671
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:34,780
lt's all right.

672
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,181
l wish l had more for you.

673
01:00:36,181 --> 01:00:37,282
lt's okay.

674
01:00:40,785 --> 01:00:44,187
Jonas. We gotta get locked down.

675
01:00:44,187 --> 01:00:46,790
You're gonna be okay, Katherine.

676
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:48,791
Try and relax.

677
01:00:48,791 --> 01:00:51,493
We're gonna take this
one step at a time.

678
01:01:07,506 --> 01:01:08,908
My head.

679
01:01:14,012 --> 01:01:17,014
Daddy, something's
wrong with me.

680
01:01:17,014 --> 01:01:17,815
Kat, what is it?

681
01:01:17,815 --> 01:01:20,417
Get you hands off me,
you son of a--

682
01:01:20,417 --> 01:01:21,918
Will, lock her down. Do it now.

683
01:01:21,918 --> 01:01:24,821
Don't! Just leave me alone.

684
01:01:24,821 --> 01:01:26,822
l don't know what's happening.

685
01:01:26,822 --> 01:01:28,223
l can't control it.

686
01:01:28,223 --> 01:01:30,425
lt's impossible.
They left her for dead.

687
01:01:30,425 --> 01:01:31,226
No!

688
01:01:32,927 --> 01:01:34,829
Will, damn it! He made her feed!

689
01:01:34,829 --> 01:01:36,330
Do it now! Lock her down!

690
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:38,031
He gave me life.

691
01:01:43,936 --> 01:01:45,337
Will?

692
01:01:45,337 --> 01:01:46,338
Will, what happened?

693
01:01:52,243 --> 01:01:53,544
Adam.

694
01:01:53,544 --> 01:01:55,546
She'll kill us, and she'll kill Timothy.

695
01:01:55,546 --> 01:01:56,847
lt's what Varek wanted.

696
01:01:57,948 --> 01:01:59,649
Baby...

697
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:02,151
you have no idea
what you're missing.

698
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:04,953
God, it's so amazing.

699
01:02:04,953 --> 01:02:06,655
We can feel it together.

700
01:02:06,655 --> 01:02:08,756
She's gone, Adam. She's turned.

701
01:02:08,756 --> 01:02:10,758
- Let me kiss you.
- That's not Katherine anymore.

702
01:02:15,362 --> 01:02:16,363
Don't make me do this.

703
01:02:16,363 --> 01:02:18,364
- Jonas, please.
- She's gone, Adam.

704
01:02:18,364 --> 01:02:20,166
You gotta do it!
You gotta do something!

705
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:26,771
Jonas.

706
01:02:36,879 --> 01:02:38,681
You shot me, you little prick!

707
01:02:38,681 --> 01:02:39,982
l'm sorry. lt'll be okay.

708
01:02:39,982 --> 01:02:41,783
All right? l...You'll...

709
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:45,887
Baby?

710
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:51,992
Help me.

711
01:02:54,393 --> 01:02:55,394
Please.

712
01:02:57,396 --> 01:02:58,497
l don't know.

713
01:02:59,898 --> 01:03:01,199
She's gone, Adam.

714
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:03,101
You gotta do something.
She's gone.

715
01:03:04,602 --> 01:03:05,803
Adam. She's gone.

716
01:03:08,805 --> 01:03:09,806
No.

717
01:03:12,808 --> 01:03:14,610
Don't. Don't do it.

718
01:03:16,812 --> 01:03:18,413
Don't, Katherine.

719
01:03:18,413 --> 01:03:19,714
Kat, l love you.

720
01:03:21,616 --> 01:03:23,517
l lo--

721
01:03:23,517 --> 01:03:24,918
You love me, too.

722
01:03:34,126 --> 01:03:35,627
All right, that's enough, baby.

723
01:03:35,627 --> 01:03:36,928
That's enough.

724
01:03:38,129 --> 01:03:39,430
Katherine.

725
01:03:46,636 --> 01:03:47,737
Please, Katherine.

726
01:03:49,538 --> 01:03:50,739
Give me that.

727
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:52,841
Please.

728
01:03:55,143 --> 01:03:57,545
You were wrong, Daddy.

729
01:03:59,947 --> 01:04:00,948
Timothy.

730
01:04:03,049 --> 01:04:04,350
Open the door, kiddo.

731
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:05,752
Timothy, don't!

732
01:04:05,752 --> 01:04:07,653
- Timothy, stay down.
- No, Timothy. Don't!

733
01:04:07,653 --> 01:04:08,954
- Keep the door closed!
- Quiet!

734
01:04:12,357 --> 01:04:13,458
Timothy.

735
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:15,760
- Come on, kiddo.
- No!

736
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,361
- Sit...down.
- Timothy, come out!

737
01:04:17,361 --> 01:04:19,062
Keep the door closed, Tim.

738
01:04:24,467 --> 01:04:26,368
lt doesn't have to be this way.

739
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:29,171
Don't you want to feel
what l'm feeling?

740
01:04:29,171 --> 01:04:30,772
Katherine.

741
01:04:30,772 --> 01:04:31,773
Think about what you're doing.

742
01:04:33,374 --> 01:04:34,775
You helped raise that boy.

743
01:04:34,775 --> 01:04:37,277
This is not you.

744
01:04:37,277 --> 01:04:38,378
lt's not you.

745
01:04:39,779 --> 01:04:41,681
You have to fight it.

746
01:04:41,681 --> 01:04:43,883
Kat, you have to fight it.

747
01:04:43,883 --> 01:04:45,184
Give me your hand.

748
01:04:45,184 --> 01:04:47,586
- Give me your hand.
- Timothy.

749
01:04:47,586 --> 01:04:49,087
Open the door.

750
01:04:49,087 --> 01:04:50,988
No! Keep the door closed!

751
01:04:50,988 --> 01:04:53,190
Uncle Jonas is trying to hurt me.

752
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:54,691
Keep driving!

753
01:04:54,691 --> 01:04:55,792
Timothy, don't.

754
01:04:58,695 --> 01:05:00,796
- Timothy!
- Close the door! He's gonna die!

755
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:01,697
- Kat?
- Close the door!

756
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:02,998
Rachel, keep driving!

757
01:05:02,998 --> 01:05:04,700
Don't stop! Keep driving!

758
01:05:06,701 --> 01:05:08,703
Close the door, now!

759
01:05:10,805 --> 01:05:12,806
Please. Please, stop it.

760
01:05:14,708 --> 01:05:16,109
l'll miss you, Daddy.

761
01:05:16,109 --> 01:05:17,710
No, don't do it.

762
01:05:24,716 --> 01:05:26,117
Oh, my God.

763
01:05:34,924 --> 01:05:36,325
Oh, my God.

764
01:06:51,787 --> 01:06:52,888
There it is.

765
01:06:53,588 --> 01:06:55,390
We only have to make it
till midnight.

766
01:06:59,093 --> 01:07:01,495
Three bodies, but there's no kid.

767
01:07:01,495 --> 01:07:02,796
There's nothin' back there.

768
01:07:02,796 --> 01:07:03,997
They're all gone.

769
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:08,701
They're close.

770
01:07:12,404 --> 01:07:13,905
Just one more hour.

771
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:15,106
We'll be safe in here.

772
01:07:16,107 --> 01:07:17,708
lt has a steel door.

773
01:07:17,708 --> 01:07:19,509
Lock's on the inside.

774
01:07:19,509 --> 01:07:20,910
- What are you thinking?
- Well, l'm out there,

775
01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:22,712
and you're in here with Tim.

776
01:07:24,213 --> 01:07:25,714
You want to go out there alone?

777
01:07:25,714 --> 01:07:27,616
l got a few tricks up my sleeve.

778
01:07:28,717 --> 01:07:30,118
Let me help you, Jonas.

779
01:07:30,118 --> 01:07:31,719
Now, you listen to me.

780
01:07:31,719 --> 01:07:33,521
After l turn, l'm gonna be
fighting the need to feed.

781
01:07:33,521 --> 01:07:35,122
We're here. We can help you.

782
01:07:35,122 --> 01:07:37,724
On anything...and anyone.

783
01:07:40,226 --> 01:07:42,428
Now, l don't know
what's gonna happen.

784
01:07:42,428 --> 01:07:45,330
But if l feed,
l'll probably lose control.

785
01:07:46,832 --> 01:07:48,233
And you're not gonna
have a choice.

786
01:07:49,734 --> 01:07:51,135
Kill me.

787
01:07:52,236 --> 01:07:53,937
You gotta kill me.

788
01:07:53,937 --> 01:07:55,338
You swear it.

789
01:07:55,338 --> 01:07:56,640
Swear to it, Rachel.

790
01:07:57,841 --> 01:07:59,542
You'll have no choice.

791
01:08:13,653 --> 01:08:15,955
lt's not for another hour,
but happy birthday, Timothy.

792
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:23,862
We just have to last until midnight.

793
01:08:23,862 --> 01:08:25,663
You're gonna be okay, Tim.

794
01:08:35,771 --> 01:08:37,072
Don't open the door.

795
01:10:05,645 --> 01:10:06,645
Here.

796
01:11:36,819 --> 01:11:38,020
Uncle Jo--

797
01:11:40,822 --> 01:11:41,923
Get down.

798
01:13:24,006 --> 01:13:25,007
Mom!

799
01:14:32,662 --> 01:14:34,063
We've gotta move now.

800
01:14:52,678 --> 01:14:53,679
Please.

801
01:14:56,381 --> 01:14:57,682
Don't hurt him.

802
01:15:22,102 --> 01:15:23,203
No!

803
01:15:39,717 --> 01:15:40,717
Mom!

804
01:15:42,519 --> 01:15:43,820
Mom, wake up! Please!

805
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:44,921
Mom, get up!

806
01:15:44,921 --> 01:15:46,122
Mom, wake up!

807
01:15:51,826 --> 01:15:52,827
Mom!

808
01:15:52,827 --> 01:15:54,829
Uncle Jonas is in trouble.

809
01:16:14,345 --> 01:16:16,446
Uncle Jonas! No!

810
01:16:18,748 --> 01:16:19,549
Don't!

811
01:16:29,657 --> 01:16:30,658
Uncle Jonas.

812
01:17:27,304 --> 01:17:28,905
Let's get the hell out of here.

813
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:35,911
No.

814
01:18:52,574 --> 01:18:54,175
Are you okay?

815
01:19:35,709 --> 01:19:36,609
Dad?

816
01:19:42,214 --> 01:19:43,215
Dad?

817
01:21:02,379 --> 01:21:03,780
Can l help you?

818
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:05,582
We'd like a room.

819
01:21:10,986 --> 01:21:12,588
l need your names

820
01:21:12,588 --> 01:21:13,989
and a credit card.

821
01:21:13,989 --> 01:21:16,190
lt'll be cash.

822
01:21:16,190 --> 01:21:17,992
Cash works.

823
01:21:36,707 --> 01:21:39,409
Sorry. My wife's a little jumpy.

824
01:21:39,409 --> 01:21:40,510
Yeah, sorry.

825
01:21:41,511 --> 01:21:43,713
lt's just one of those nights.

826
01:22:02,728 --> 01:22:06,131
So many people sacrificed
their lives for me.

827
01:22:06,131 --> 01:22:08,433
And now we make sure
they didn't die in vain.

828
01:22:13,337 --> 01:22:15,138
Uncle Jonas was right after all.

829
01:22:19,142 --> 01:22:21,243
l do have the power
to end the curse.

830
01:22:25,247 --> 01:22:27,949
lt's just not going to be
as easy as they all hoped.

831
01:22:30,851 --> 01:22:32,352
The power is in my blood.

832
01:22:50,868 --> 01:22:51,868
l've heard...

833
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:55,772
l'm here to be cured.

834
01:23:02,677 --> 01:23:06,080
For some, l am salvation.

835
01:23:07,412 --> 01:23:09,883
For the others...

836
01:23:09,883 --> 01:23:11,684
their destruction.
