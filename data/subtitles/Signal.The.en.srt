Which one are you going for, bud?

58
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:16,073
The white one? With goggles?

59
00:01:21,213 --> 00:01:24,682
Okay, I'm gonna show you
how to get there. Okay?

60
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:31,222
Okay, you're gonna follow...

61
00:01:32,457 --> 00:01:35,325
this line till it gets to...

62
00:01:36,228 --> 00:01:39,198
Till it gets to this circle, okay?

63
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,834
When it hits that circle,
you press the button.

64
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:46,838
Then you're gonna follow this bottom
line until it gets to this circle.

65
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,375
Then you press the
button, okay? Got it?

66
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,878
Okay, you got any money?

67
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,378
Okay, well, here's $1.

68
00:01:55,847 --> 00:01:57,848
Good luck.

69
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,387
Hey.

70
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:31,161
Nomad's back. He's
messing with us again.

71
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:41,673
What did he say?

72
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:48,112
"Your hack into MIT
servers was legit."

73
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,283
That was fast.

74
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:55,721
"Ta, ta, ta." What is that?

75
00:05:56,721 --> 00:06:00,826
"They put that shit on us.
"We almost got expelled."

76
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:12,036
"Vibes."

77
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:16,175
Who's this Vibes? Okay, guy.

78
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:19,144
"We're going to expose
you at DEF CON,

79
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:21,812
"so you better watch your back."

80
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:28,619
Dude, what is that?

81
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,826
What the...

82
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,574
<i>Go into the building.</i>

83
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,649
Get the Pwnie.

84
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:59,685
All right, let's do this.

85
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,853
Open up a Linux terminal
and start an Nmap, dude.

86
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,689
Haley's gonna have
to drive tomorrow.

87
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,024
Hey, focus.

88
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,892
That's what I'm saying,
I won't be able to.

89
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:10,629
Technically she's the one moving, so
technically she should be driving.

90
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,764
- Is it open yet?
- In a sec.

91
00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:15,899
- Okay, I'm good.
- Okay.

92
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:24,209
Okay, type something.

93
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:26,745
I'm trying to think
of something funny.

94
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:28,213
Damn.

95
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:32,449
"Do androids take
an electric sheet?"

96
00:07:33,451 --> 00:07:35,519
You're stupid.

97
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:39,324
Okay, read me out the
IPs on the C&C servers.

98
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:44,764
"192. 236. 19. 147."

99
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,766
147. Start sniffing connections.

100
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,933
Copy that. Firing up the listeners.

101
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,435
All right, this guy's toast.

102
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,677
Nevada.

103
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:01,478
Dude, we're going
right through Nevada.

104
00:08:02,213 --> 00:08:04,749
- We got him.
- We got him!

105
00:08:10,956 --> 00:08:13,423
Are you guys being
serious right now?

106
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:19,430
Well, you're driving
in the morning, so...

107
00:08:19,531 --> 00:08:21,298
good night.

108
00:08:23,235 --> 00:08:28,172
I'd like to see you make
me, you Caltech turncoat.

109
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,427
Haley, this fish tank's
leaking something.

110
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:49,961
It's water, Jonah.

111
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,263
- It's gross.
- Shut up.

112
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:56,900
- You Caltech turncoats.
- Dude, can you stop saying that?

113
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,110
- Signal sucks out here.
- You're right, it does suck.

114
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,451
- Hey, you want one of these?
- No, I'm good, thanks.

115
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:08,219
You want?

116
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:17,520
Dude.

117
00:09:19,524 --> 00:09:22,525
- What?
- Check this out.

118
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:26,764
What the hell?
Why isn't that working?

119
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,301
Is that my car?

120
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,804
- Yeah. It's a traffic camera.
- This guy is so gnarly.

121
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:35,508
- How does he have a picture of my car?
- Hold on a sec.

122
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:38,677
Why would this guy go to all
the trouble to hack into MIT,

123
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,013
and then, you know,
just taunt us like this?

124
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,682
The same reason anyone does
anything. Acknowledgment.

125
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,451
"I'm better than you, you're
better than me," whatever.

126
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:48,186
Here, dude, I can't
unlock it. You try.

127
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:55,525
You guys should just
stop provoking him.

128
00:09:56,562 --> 00:10:00,596
He's probably just some little kid.

129
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,738
- Nic, are we doing this or not?
- I can't, dude.

130
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,705
What do you mean, you can't?

131
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:13,345
I just can't right now.

132
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,913
Look, I get we have to
take Haley to California.

133
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:20,586
But there's no reason we
shouldn't do this, too.

134
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:24,856
Nomad hacking into MIT is one
thing, but Haley's computer?

135
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,692
No, but it's crazy not
to go after this guy.

136
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,195
- Jonah, what's the sales tax?
- We're so close.

137
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:33,365
6.3. It's on the way.

138
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:36,567
$14.74. You can keep the change.

139
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:17,107
- You guys want something?
- Yeah.

140
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:20,980
- Coffee?
- Yeah, I'd love a coffee.

141
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,682
- Black?
- There you go. Yeah, please.

142
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,163
What?

143
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:45,769
Has Nic said anything
to you about me moving?

144
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:48,072
No.

145
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:51,076
Nothing?

146
00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:55,245
No, obviously he's bummed you're
gonna be gone for a year.

147
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,789
It just seems like he's trying to
distance himself from me, you know?

148
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:08,091
Look, you guys are my best friends,

149
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,263
and I'm just...

150
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,397
I'm the wrongest guy to ask.

151
00:12:17,101 --> 00:12:18,769
Yeah.

152
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,840
Oh, crap.

153
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:26,543
Hey.

154
00:12:27,712 --> 00:12:29,947
You all right, bud?

155
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,616
- I'm fine.
- Yeah?

156
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,850
I'm fine, I'm fine.

157
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,253
I'm gonna get more coffees.

158
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,528
I'm gonna... move the car.

159
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:04,414
Best friends!

160
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,389
Is this one mine?

161
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,914
Yeah. I already put two in.

162
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,726
- Here you go.
- I got it.

163
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,269
Nic, I offer to help not
because I think you need it,

164
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,537
but because I know you don't.

165
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:29,639
Yeah, well, you won't have to
worry about that soon, will you?

166
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,010
Okay.

167
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:45,522
Thanks, bud.

168
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,261
We're not really that far
from this guy, are we?

169
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:53,429
180 miles, give or take.

170
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,033
All right, dude, let's do it.

171
00:13:58,236 --> 00:14:00,405
Let's go.

172
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:03,274
Now, see, this is the
Nicholas Eastman I love.

173
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:07,277
You know, just determined,
ruthless, competitive.

174
00:14:07,312 --> 00:14:09,946
Oh, and favors caffeine.

175
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,184
Where's Haley?

176
00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:19,022
I don't know. I think
she walked, uh...

177
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:22,493
That way.

178
00:14:43,481 --> 00:14:47,519
Haley, look, I'm sorry. It's
just, I've been distracted.

179
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,587
I think you're getting ready
to make a big speech.

180
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:52,991
I think this whole trip is about
you getting ready to make it.

181
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:56,659
What are you talking about?
I'm not gonna make a speech.

182
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,761
Stop.

183
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,884
Haley, you know how many times
I've played this out in my head?

184
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:22,721
Twice-a-week doctor's appointments.

185
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:28,659
Who knows how many MRis and
tests. Eventually a wheelchair.

186
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,528
All the time wondering if
you're gonna break up with me.

187
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,297
- Stop.
- When you're gonna get tired of this...

188
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,443
It's not fair to
make me the bad guy

189
00:15:33,446 --> 00:15:35,533
- without my input.
- Haley, that's not what I'm saying.

190
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:39,070
I'm just saying I'm not gonna
be the guy who holds you back.

191
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:46,277
Cool. So, uh...

192
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,046
I move away for one year and...

193
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:53,552
because you're scared
of what's gonna happen,

194
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:56,820
you immediately resort
to breaking up?

195
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,700
I'm just saying...
I'm just saying...

196
00:15:59,701 --> 00:16:02,693
- I need to protect myself.
- From what?

197
00:16:04,028 --> 00:16:07,630
- Is it your heart talking or your head?
- It's me talking.

198
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,538
But you're the one that always told me to
run toward something and not away from it.

199
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:15,639
Yeah, well, that was
before all this shit.

200
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:31,822
What are you doing?

201
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:40,431
You can keep your promises.
I don't want them.

202
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:52,743
Haley.

203
00:16:56,748 --> 00:17:01,350
You just take a left up here.
It's about 20 miles or so.

204
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,155
Maybe we should drop
Haley off first.

205
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:07,191
Can you not talk about
me like I'm not in the car?

206
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:13,195
Haley, you don't
have to come along.

207
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:15,865
No, I wanna meet this asshole.

208
00:17:16,234 --> 00:17:18,134
Me, too.

209
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:33,450
Just keep going. We still
got, like, a quarter mile.

210
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,775
- Stop, stop, we passed it.
- What?

211
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,375
Yeah, back up.

212
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,453
Say, 20 or 30 feet.

213
00:18:11,823 --> 00:18:14,023
Stop, stop.

214
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,296
- I think it's right here.
- You serious?

215
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,134
It's right here. It's right here.

216
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:28,505
- Don't get us stuck. Please, Nic.
- We're fine.

217
00:18:28,673 --> 00:18:30,708
It's over here.

218
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,894
You should kill the headlights.

219
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:41,185
Are you sure you want to do this?

220
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:45,489
I'm not gonna lie.
This doesn't look right.

221
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,025
What do you think?

222
00:18:50,494 --> 00:18:53,898
We're not gonna know
by sitting in the car.

223
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,034
Come on, let's go. Get your camera.

224
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:01,003
Haley, stay in and
lock the doors, okay?

225
00:19:02,106 --> 00:19:03,807
Nic.

226
00:19:04,242 --> 00:19:06,943
You know all this is stupid, right?

227
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:18,022
- Where do you think we went wrong?
- What are you talking about?

228
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:21,125
You know, it must have been,
like, a random IP allocation.

229
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:23,561
Like, they could be in
Georgia for all we know.

230
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:27,297
- Like, Europe Georgia.
- Shut up.

231
00:19:31,435 --> 00:19:34,771
Or they could be using
this as a relay point.

232
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,910
A big mama sat in that chair.

233
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:49,452
I'm gonna have to say
there's nobody here, Nic.

234
00:19:58,797 --> 00:19:59,998
Dude, Nomad is not here.

235
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,067
- Let's take a look.
- He's not here.

236
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,769
We'll take a look
and then we'll go.

237
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,071
Let's go find him.

238
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:09,506
A hillbilly lives here.

239
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:14,010
- This guy has a baby?
- Shh!

240
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,349
Shh!

241
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,213
Jonah?

242
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,984
Jonah?

243
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:06,096
Jonah?

244
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,534
Dude, I can see you.
What are you doing?

245
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,201
Hey!

246
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,143
Dude, you're such an asshole!

247
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,383
How funny is this little chair?

248
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:26,917
It was really facing
the corner like this.

249
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,419
Come on. There's a basement.

250
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:33,556
You're such a kike.

251
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,763
- Go down.
- Screw that, you go down.

252
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,534
Be careful.

253
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,415
What is this place?

254
00:22:02,186 --> 00:22:04,320
Check it out, man.

255
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,459
What are those?

256
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,163
- Server racks.
- That's weird.

257
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,271
Oh, wait. Haley!

258
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:26,676
Haley! Haley! Haley!

259
00:22:28,813 --> 00:22:30,779
Haley!

260
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:37,655
What the hell?

261
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,592
- What was that sound?
- I don't know.

262
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:43,961
- Why are the car doors open like that?
- I don't know!

263
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,729
Haley!

264
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,672
- Haley!
- Shh!

265
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,906
Listen.

266
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:07,751
Oh, my God.

267
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:11,221
- Haley!
- Haley!

268
00:23:11,589 --> 00:23:13,556
Haley!

269
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:58,861
Can you... speak?

270
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,465
Where am I?

271
00:25:03,734 --> 00:25:05,868
I can't move.

272
00:25:07,404 --> 00:25:09,505
Can you tell me your name?

273
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:13,211
Nicholas Eastman.

274
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,579
I'm Damon. Dr. Wallace Damon.

275
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:20,050
I'm heading up the transition
team that's going to help you,

276
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:25,989
help all of us understand exactly
what you've been through.

277
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:29,192
What are you talking about?

278
00:25:30,394 --> 00:25:34,798
Can you recall for me the first
time you encountered the signal?

279
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,967
The what?

280
00:25:39,336 --> 00:25:41,637
Why can't I move?

281
00:25:42,773 --> 00:25:44,342
What happened to us?

282
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:47,578
Due to the circumstances
surrounding your condition,

283
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:53,115
I'm afraid that our information
is... extremely limited.

284
00:25:53,183 --> 00:25:55,787
Wait, what's my condition?

285
00:25:55,788 --> 00:26:00,189
What I'm about to tell you, Nic,
you may find a bit disturbing.

286
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:04,760
You have made contact
with an E.B.E.

287
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:07,265
E.B.E.?

288
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:12,201
Extraterrestrial Biological
Entity. E.B.E.

289
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:17,473
I want to talk to my parents.

290
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:23,948
- I'm sorry, that's just not possible.
- What are you talking about?

291
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:28,919
Where's Haley and Jonah?
What happened to us?

292
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:33,423
Why am I... in a wheelchair?

293
00:26:38,128 --> 00:26:40,330
Why...

294
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,632
Why are you wearing that suit?

295
00:26:44,368 --> 00:26:48,906
We're not 100% certain about
what we're dealing with here.

296
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:53,478
The possibility for alien
contamination is... very real.

297
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:56,112
When you say "alien
contamination," do you mean...

298
00:26:56,114 --> 00:27:00,040
microbiological
contamination, as in foreign?

299
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,085
Hold still.

300
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,238
Oh.

301
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,910
It's just blood.

302
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,113
<i>It's just blood.</i>

303
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:36,419
I think we'll stop here for today.

304
00:28:48,092 --> 00:28:51,784
<i>Contact values at 9, 8,</i>

305
00:28:51,785 --> 00:28:56,031
<i>47, 91, 72.</i>

306
00:29:01,538 --> 00:29:04,707
<i>Level 12. Do we know current value?</i>

307
00:29:39,076 --> 00:29:43,090
Stop! Will you stop? Stop!

308
00:29:43,092 --> 00:29:46,648
Go back! Can you go back?

309
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,627
What's wrong with Haley?

310
00:30:01,164 --> 00:30:04,368
As advanced as we are,

311
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:10,972
it's amazing that a tool as crude
as a pen still has its place.

312
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:15,310
There we go.

313
00:30:16,446 --> 00:30:20,650
I want to talk to Haley. Please.

314
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,119
I'm afraid that's not
possible right now.

315
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:25,690
Why?

316
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:27,992
She's in good hands,
Nic, I promise you.

317
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:30,961
The best thing you can do for
her right now is to help us.

318
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:34,697
Now, will you please try
to cooperate with me?

319
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:40,869
- Okay.
- Good.

320
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:47,042
First I'm going to ask you
some simple control questions.

321
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:51,012
Do you have 10 toes?

322
00:30:55,953 --> 00:30:57,854
Yes.

323
00:31:00,991 --> 00:31:03,692
Are you from Earth?

324
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:12,701
- Yes, I am from Earth.
- Good, thank you.

325
00:31:13,904 --> 00:31:16,507
Now, this signal that you and
your friends were pursuing,

326
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,108
when did you first encounter it?

327
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:20,743
- You mean Nomad.
- Yes.

328
00:31:20,744 --> 00:31:23,779
MIT. He got into our
school's security network

329
00:31:23,786 --> 00:31:27,883
and ruined some major servers,
including our personal ones.

330
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:36,192
Nic, I want you to watch something.

331
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:50,539
<i>A big mama sat in that chair.</i>

332
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:21,703
You definitely weren't
pursuing a hacker.

333
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,061
Hey.

334
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:52,902
Hey.

335
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:57,873
- Jonah?
- Nic.

336
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:01,175
- Jonah!
- Nic!

337
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:03,280
Oh, my God! Jonah, where are you?

338
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:06,517
I don't know. I'm locked
up, I'm in a room.

339
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:10,253
Me, too. I'm in a locked room,
dude. Where are we?

340
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:14,392
I heard them say we're not allowed above
ground because we were contaminated.

341
00:33:14,393 --> 00:33:17,327
What the hell was Nomad?
What have they told you?

342
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,230
Not much.

343
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:23,300
I saw Haley. She's in
a coma or something.

344
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:27,502
Nic, they're doing some
weird shit here, man.

345
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,272
My body doesn't feel right.

346
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:34,112
- Nic, I gotta go.
- What? Where?

347
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:38,548
This place is run like a clock.
I can't believe you're in the vent!

348
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:40,718
What? Dude, I'm not in the vent.

349
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:44,788
I'm not in the vent! Jonah! Jonah!

350
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:52,762
- Why don't you have any clocks that work?
- Clocks that work?

351
00:33:52,763 --> 00:33:54,598
Yeah. The one in the
hallway is stuck at 12:30.

352
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,434
- Which hallway?
- Seven windows back. Left turn.

353
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,202
Four windows. Right turn.
Two windows on the right.

354
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:03,301
Next to the bathroom with its sign
upside down. It's stuck at 12:30.

355
00:34:03,305 --> 00:34:09,246
Nic, it's a broken clock. Thank you
for bringing it to my attention.

356
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:13,581
Can we please proceed with
the shapes and colors?

357
00:34:13,617 --> 00:34:17,059
- Screw this. This is stupid.
- What's the matter, Nic?

358
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:19,422
- Can't you do it?
- No, I choose not to do it.

359
00:34:19,423 --> 00:34:24,461
Choose? You choose not to do it?
That sounds like pride talking.

360
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:27,563
False and foolish pride. That's all.

361
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,873
Pyramid, yellow.

362
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:39,976
- And the...
- Cube, blue. Sphere, green.

363
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:42,681
The blue tile here that says "Zero"
corresponds with the green cube.

364
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:44,782
The yellow tile here that says
"Six" goes with the cube.

365
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:47,318
The green tile here that says "Five"
goes with the yellow pyramid.

366
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:49,420
The green cube goes with
the blue shaped cube.

367
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,255
The yellow written sphere goes
with the green-shaped sphere.

368
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,391
The blue written pyramid goes
with the yellow-shaped pyramid.

369
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,025
"Blue," written in yellow,
"yellow," in green,

370
00:34:55,027 --> 00:34:57,094
correspond the visible colors and
shapes rather than the written words

371
00:34:57,096 --> 00:34:59,963
because the spectral quality of light
is more objective, so to speak,

372
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:03,032
than the written English
words of those colors.

373
00:35:04,668 --> 00:35:07,905
- I see.
- You see? What do you mean, you see?

374
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,240
You, Nic.

375
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:14,010
I see you and I think I'm beginning to
understand something more about you.

376
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:16,079
Understand what?

377
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:19,751
The colors, the shapes,
they have an effect on you.

378
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:22,018
I'd say it was an emotional
effect, wouldn't you?

379
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:24,644
I don't care about the shapes and
colors, they don't mean anything to me.

380
00:35:24,646 --> 00:35:28,590
They don't mean shit to me! You're the
one that's infuriating me, you quack!

381
00:35:29,693 --> 00:35:31,561
"Quack."

382
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,730
"Quack."

383
00:35:34,264 --> 00:35:37,302
I wanna see Haley

384
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:41,103
and I'm not gonna say another
word until you let me see her.

385
00:35:43,373 --> 00:35:45,641
Okay, Nic.

386
00:35:54,251 --> 00:35:55,885
There's nothing on here.

387
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:59,420
She's in a coma, Nic.

388
00:35:59,523 --> 00:36:03,159
There's nothing that can
be done for her right now.

389
00:36:03,927 --> 00:36:08,032
I promise, as soon as she wakes up,
you'll be the first one to see her.

390
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:11,601
Right now we're doing
everything humanly possible.

391
00:36:50,407 --> 00:36:52,809
<i>Nic, this place is insane.</i>

392
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:55,246
Yeah, I know. Listen.
You were right.

393
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:59,083
This place is run like a clock.
Listen, I need your help.

394
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:00,918
I've been keeping some
event sequences...

395
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:04,021
Nic, it was hard to put
all this together,

396
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:07,257
but, you know, I think
we're sick, or infected.

397
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:10,193
Hey, Jonah, stop thinking
like that, man. Seriously.

398
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:13,264
No, they're trying to keep whatever's
inside us from metastasizing.

399
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:16,766
Jonah, stop. Nothing's
metastasizing, okay?

400
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,635
- We're fine. We're gonna be fine.
- No, I'm not.

401
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:21,503
- Just trust me on this.
- No, my body is not.

402
00:37:22,606 --> 00:37:24,940
We gotta get out of here.

403
00:37:25,608 --> 00:37:28,179
Yeah, I know. We will.

404
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,481
Okay, I've got the
variables on my keypad.

405
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:33,150
Now I need you to take back
half the sequences, okay?

406
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,619
- Yeah. I'll help.
- Okay.

407
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:39,990
- But my glasses are messed up, though.
- Hey, it's gonna be fine.

408
00:37:39,992 --> 00:37:43,626
It's gonna be fine. Don't
worry about your glasses.

409
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:45,061
Okay, I'm gonna give
it to you spatially.

410
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:47,797
Three v three phone style.
Okay, you ready?

411
00:37:47,797 --> 00:37:50,233
- Yeah.
- Okay.

412
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:56,005
Top-middle, middle-middle,
top-left, bottom-left.

413
00:37:56,005 --> 00:37:58,976
- 2-5-1-7.
- You got it?

414
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:00,844
Bottom-left first.

415
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:05,581
Middle-middle second.
Top-middle third.

416
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,449
Top-left last.

417
00:38:11,588 --> 00:38:14,592
Nic, I'm having a hard
time handling this.

418
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:17,728
They made me drink some
weird stuff the other day

419
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:21,096
and I haven't really been
able to feel my arms.

420
00:38:22,365 --> 00:38:26,534
Your arms? What? What do you mean?

421
00:38:26,536 --> 00:38:28,505
Oh, God!

422
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:34,177
- Dude, who is it?
- I gotta go.

423
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:36,679
Jonah, hold on a second.

424
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:41,016
Jonah! Jonah!

425
00:38:41,518 --> 00:38:43,351
Jonah!

426
00:39:13,483 --> 00:39:15,650
Agitate.

427
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:48,416
<i>Everybody outside.</i>

428
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:53,523
<i>Recovery team to level 14.
Subject has breached.</i>

429
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:55,824
<i>Subject has escaped.</i>

430
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:12,643
Oh, sorry, I was just looking
for the water fountain.

431
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:28,190
<i>Recovery team to level 14.</i>

432
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,427
<i>Subject has breached. Escaped.</i>

433
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:55,452
<i>Can you raise your arm?</i>

434
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:57,918
<i>What happened in the hallway?</i>

435
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,760
Good.

436
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:08,264
Still no feeling in your legs?

437
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:11,101
What happened to Jonah?

438
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:14,672
Look, I know you guys know I
can talk to him through the vent.

439
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:16,340
What the hell did you
guys do with him?

440
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,842
Yes, Nic, we have been
listening to you,

441
00:41:18,842 --> 00:41:21,471
- but the truth of the matter...
- The truth of the matter is,

442
00:41:21,472 --> 00:41:23,246
total Mickey Mouse operation here.

443
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:26,983
Antiquated methodologies,
dinosaurs with government grants.

444
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,619
A whole facility built during
the first wave of Big Science

445
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:33,356
outdated but allowed to continue
pretending that you're important.

446
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:35,525
- I feel sorry for you. It's pathetic.
- Nic.

447
00:41:35,527 --> 00:41:38,159
"The truth of the matter."

448
00:41:38,528 --> 00:41:40,630
What is the truth
of the matter here?

449
00:41:40,632 --> 00:41:44,034
The only thing I know for certain is that
you don't know what you're dealing with.

450
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:47,605
You will be pulled from this shitty little
shack you call a research facility so fast

451
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:49,773
that the only thing relevant
to be shown for any of this

452
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:51,842
is the way it's all exposed,
wrecked, and forgotten.

453
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,844
You have no idea!
You have no clue! Do you?

454
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,440
Have any clue how fast dumb,
lost little kids like me,

455
00:41:57,442 --> 00:41:59,525
Jonah or Nomad could
ruin a place like this?

456
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,219
Have it come to a grinding halt
like the stone wheel it is?

457
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:04,188
You're clueless law in
the Wild West, Damon.

458
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:08,257
You're a relic protecting
ruins. You're pathetic.

459
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:12,262
The truth of the matter is, I'm the
only one with any sense around here.

460
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,367
Your friend Jonah...

461
00:42:20,637 --> 00:42:21,972
was never here, Nic.

462
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:25,773
- We never recovered him.
- Bullshit!

463
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:28,846
I've been talking to him through
the vent this whole time.

464
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:31,012
Have you really?

465
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:35,317
Through your vent, Nic?

466
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:55,063
Three, four, five, six, seven...

467
00:44:07,844 --> 00:44:10,077
Shit.

468
00:44:58,661 --> 00:45:00,795
Shit!

469
00:45:15,278 --> 00:45:17,012
God damn it!

470
00:46:56,445 --> 00:46:58,746
Nic.

471
00:47:06,889 --> 00:47:08,990
Hey.

472
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,293
How are you feeling?

473
00:47:13,963 --> 00:47:16,331
Better.

474
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:43,891
I had a wonderful dream.

475
00:47:44,226 --> 00:47:46,728
Oh, yeah?

476
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:49,630
You, um...

477
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:53,034
You...

478
00:47:54,771 --> 00:47:58,005
You won your regionals.

479
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:07,416
Hay, wake up. Wake up.

480
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:09,583
Haley.

481
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:14,791
Stop it, get off of me!
Get off of me!

482
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:18,896
What the hell are you doing? Let go
of me! Haley! Haley, wake up!

483
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,465
Hey, let go of me! Stop it! What
the hell do you think you're doing?

484
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:24,833
Haley, wake up! Haley! Wake up!

485
00:48:44,353 --> 00:48:46,855
Holy... Holy...

486
00:49:00,302 --> 00:49:03,405
No! What the hell?

487
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,210
Damon!

488
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,646
<i>What did they do to my legs?</i>

489
00:49:53,289 --> 00:49:58,827
Nic, we are going to
need you to calm down.

490
00:50:00,396 --> 00:50:05,402
<i>Now you understand why we've
been so interested in you.</i>

491
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:09,704
<i>As you can see, your
circumstances are very peculiar.</i>

492
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:16,610
And believe me, we didn't
want to shock you with this.

493
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:18,541
I'm sure by now you can appreciate
where we're coming from.

494
00:51:18,543 --> 00:51:22,711
<i>Now, for your safety and ours,</i>

495
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:28,451
I'm going to need you to
hook yourself up to that IV.

496
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:30,518
Right over there.

497
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,722
Nic.

498
00:52:06,724 --> 00:52:09,356
I need you...

499
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:12,393
to calm down.

500
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,239
<i>Nic.</i>

501
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:40,481
Nic.

502
00:53:45,454 --> 00:53:47,621
Don't do this.

503
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:50,827
Why...

504
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:52,795
Why didn't you tell me
what happened to my legs?

505
00:53:52,797 --> 00:53:56,599
How could we? We had
just recovered you.

506
00:53:56,599 --> 00:53:58,969
Now listen to me.

507
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:04,338
It is extremely dangerous
for you up there.

508
00:54:04,873 --> 00:54:09,612
I can only safeguard you
from them down here.

509
00:54:09,612 --> 00:54:11,878
Safeguard me from who?

510
00:55:42,905 --> 00:55:46,807
You okay? Can you feel your legs?

511
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:49,777
Come on, we gotta move.

512
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:51,646
We gotta move.

513
00:55:52,981 --> 00:55:55,284
You okay?

514
00:55:55,286 --> 00:55:57,751
- What's happening?
- Come on, let's go.

515
00:56:38,393 --> 00:56:41,831
I'm sorry to interrupt, but do you know
how long it is until the gas station?

516
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:45,501
Hmm? Oh, it's just up a ways.

517
00:56:45,503 --> 00:56:50,172
Okay. Thank you. And
where are we exactly?

518
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:52,509
When our car broke down,
we kind of got lost.

519
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:57,447
That's okay. That happens to a
lot of people out in these parts.

520
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:58,815
Right.

521
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:02,784
I always tell people they should
take comfort in the thought

522
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:06,286
that they are always
watching over us.

523
00:57:07,556 --> 00:57:09,489
Hmm.

524
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:17,565
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

525
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:22,903
Listen, with your
mouth open, like this.

526
00:57:25,068 --> 00:57:26,672
Excuse me?

527
00:57:32,581 --> 00:57:36,083
Their horns are watching over us.

528
00:57:40,889 --> 00:57:44,826
- I'm sorry. Who's watching us?
- God's little angels.

529
00:57:47,496 --> 00:57:49,496
Who else?

530
00:58:19,228 --> 00:58:21,097
Thanks again for the ride.

531
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:24,233
You have the rest
of the day nicely.

532
00:58:24,233 --> 00:58:27,335
Just push from the inside out.

533
00:58:30,405 --> 00:58:31,972
Bye.

534
00:58:36,411 --> 00:58:38,846
- Bye.
- Bye.

535
00:58:40,449 --> 00:58:42,851
- Inside out, don't forget.
- Okay, thanks.

536
00:58:47,923 --> 00:58:51,768
I'm gonna go use the phone,
okay? I'm gonna get us help.

537
00:58:51,769 --> 00:58:54,846
Stay here. Don't move.

538
00:58:56,498 --> 00:59:00,769
Haley! Haley, sit down. Sit down.

539
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:04,974
I'm serious, okay?
I'm serious. Don't move.

540
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:08,809
- I'm gonna get us out of here, okay?
- Yeah, okay.

Haley!

552
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:27,088
Hey!

553
01:00:28,657 --> 01:00:30,324
Hey!

554
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:32,126
Hey!

555
01:00:33,295 --> 01:00:35,164
Haley!

556
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:39,333
- Stop the truck!
- Christ. What the hell are you doing?

557
01:00:40,202 --> 01:00:42,969
Get back! You get back now!

558
01:00:44,172 --> 01:00:46,608
Stop the truck! Stop it!

559
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:48,943
- Get off my truck!
- Haley! Stop the truck!

560
01:00:49,277 --> 01:00:53,114
- Haley!
- Get off the goddamn truck!

561
01:01:29,818 --> 01:01:31,920
- Get away!
- Haley!

562
01:01:31,922 --> 01:01:34,021
- Stop!
- What is wrong with you?

563
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:54,076
Boy, what's going on with your leg?

564
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:56,043
Come on.

565
01:01:57,079 --> 01:01:59,148
You won't get far.

566
01:02:39,755 --> 01:02:41,489
Nic.

567
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:44,492
Nic, what happened to your legs?

568
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:48,128
Haley, I already explained to you.

569
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:51,398
Are you feeling okay?

570
01:02:52,233 --> 01:02:54,101
Yeah.

571
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:56,572
Yeah, I'm okay.

572
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,840
We're gonna be fine. Just...

573
01:03:00,541 --> 01:03:02,878
Just try to relax.

574
01:03:09,885 --> 01:03:11,818
Oh, shit.

575
01:03:31,739 --> 01:03:35,576
Is something wrong, Officer?
Is there some kind of trouble?

576
01:03:35,577 --> 01:03:39,914
No trouble at all, ma'am.
No trouble at all.

577
01:03:40,615 --> 01:03:42,449
Please.

578
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,355
Will you accompany me?

579
01:03:47,722 --> 01:03:49,456
Certainly.

580
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:11,778
It doesn't make any sense.

581
01:04:14,282 --> 01:04:17,150
Where's the rest of the road?

582
01:04:19,588 --> 01:04:25,159
<i>Mirabelle, have you had contact
with any strangers lately?</i>

583
01:04:28,931 --> 01:04:31,998
Oh, yes.

584
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:36,137
We talked about... so
many wonderful things.

585
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:39,175
But where did you
take them, Mirabelle?

586
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:41,376
What was your proximity to them?

587
01:04:42,746 --> 01:04:45,681
It is so easy to find.

588
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:50,585
<i>Always such a nice bit of color
against the dark nights.</i>

589
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:52,420
<i>Dark nights, dark nights.</i>

590
01:04:52,422 --> 01:04:55,324
Dark nights, dark nights.

591
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:58,893
Dark nights, nights...

592
01:05:02,197 --> 01:05:04,931
We could have a picnic.

593
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:07,034
A picnic.

594
01:05:07,135 --> 01:05:10,206
<i>A picnic. Have a picnic.</i>

595
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:12,474
<i>In a...</i>

596
01:05:12,476 --> 01:05:14,043
In a...

597
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:15,378
<i>In a...</i>

598
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:16,644
<i>On a...</i>

599
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:17,911
<i>On a...</i>

600
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:25,186
<i>We're coming to get you.</i>

601
01:05:50,311 --> 01:05:52,748
Is that the same canyon?

602
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:56,083
I don't know. I thought we
already passed it. Before.

603
01:05:56,318 --> 01:05:58,818
Maybe we circled back?

604
01:06:01,056 --> 01:06:03,556
Yeah, maybe. I don't know.

605
01:06:03,826 --> 01:06:06,293
It looks abandoned.

606
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:14,769
What are you looking for?

607
01:06:14,771 --> 01:06:20,007
A gun, like, a cell phone or
a map or something in here.

608
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:26,146
Do you wanna wear that?

609
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:43,831
Come on, let's check it out.

610
01:06:53,208 --> 01:06:56,610
<i>The network is
currently unavailable.</i>

611
01:07:07,222 --> 01:07:09,856
Haley, did you find anything?

612
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,594
Haley?

613
01:07:14,161 --> 01:07:15,628
Hey.

614
01:07:16,231 --> 01:07:21,601
Yeah, I found a map, but there's
not much information on it.

615
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:23,938
"You are here."

616
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:29,844
But we can't be. We
drove down, right?

617
01:07:29,846 --> 01:07:32,481
Isn't that the same gorge
we just came from?

618
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:35,516
Then that town, Good Springs,
should be down here, right?

619
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:37,418
I guess.

620
01:07:38,856 --> 01:07:40,913
I don't get it.

621
01:08:19,895 --> 01:08:22,563
What do you think that sound is?

622
01:08:26,335 --> 01:08:28,969
I don't hear anything, Hay.

623
01:08:29,137 --> 01:08:31,305
What sound?

624
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:35,009
There.

625
01:08:39,881 --> 01:08:43,484
I think we should
stay here tonight.

626
01:08:46,688 --> 01:08:48,822
Is this my fault?

627
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:51,692
What? No.

628
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:54,430
If anything, it's my fault.

629
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:57,265
I was the one who
wanted to follow Nomad.

630
01:08:57,266 --> 01:08:59,734
I don't remember.

631
01:09:10,345 --> 01:09:12,512
Do they hurt?

632
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:16,484
It's okay.

633
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:23,323
So wide.

634
01:09:23,591 --> 01:09:26,359
I hope we can get across it.

635
01:09:42,543 --> 01:09:44,813
Haley. Hey, hey.

636
01:09:46,114 --> 01:09:48,381
We should go inside.

637
01:10:39,769 --> 01:10:41,436
Jonah!

638
01:10:41,438 --> 01:10:44,806
Jonah! Jonah!
No, Jonah! Jonah! It's me!

639
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:49,144
Jonah, Jonah, Jonah!
Hey, it's Nic! Hey! It's Nic!

640
01:10:49,145 --> 01:10:52,979
Jonah, hey. Hey,
buddy, it's me. It's me.

641
01:10:53,181 --> 01:10:54,614
Shit.

642
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:58,886
Hello, James. Long time no see.

643
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:00,588
"Hello, James."

644
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:06,862
I'm trying to locate three individuals.
Two males, one female.

645
01:11:06,863 --> 01:11:09,465
All extremely contagious.

646
01:11:09,466 --> 01:11:12,399
Have you had any contact
with them, James?

647
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:18,606
What are you doing in my house?

648
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:23,944
I'm glad to see you're comfortable
here, but is this your house?

649
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:26,646
Belongs to my mommy.

650
01:11:27,983 --> 01:11:30,685
- My brother sleeps right there.
- Yes?

651
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:33,822
And I sleep right there,
and I have a little kitty.

652
01:11:33,823 --> 01:11:35,556
Your brother, your
mother and your kitty.

653
01:11:35,557 --> 01:11:37,559
Yeah.

654
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,793
Can you remember
their names, James?

655
01:11:44,666 --> 01:11:48,636
Extraordinary, your will to survive

656
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:53,172
fueled by your anger, your
fear, loneliness, frustration.

657
01:11:57,345 --> 01:12:00,747
- I admire you.
- I don't understand.

658
01:12:03,018 --> 01:12:05,252
It's all right, James.

659
01:13:10,484 --> 01:13:13,119
<i>I'm sorry I left you guys there.</i>

660
01:13:13,521 --> 01:13:16,958
You know, I swear someone was helping me,
though I just can't bring it together.

661
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:19,088
- Jonah, that place was...
- That place!

662
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:22,185
This place! It's all the same, Nic.

663
01:13:22,797 --> 01:13:24,466
It's all the same.

664
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:29,202
- What are you talking about?
- Look at your legs, man.

665
01:13:29,637 --> 01:13:32,341
Look at your legs. Look at us.

666
01:13:32,341 --> 01:13:34,507
Look for the numbers.

667
01:13:34,775 --> 01:13:38,110
For... the tattoo.

668
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,713
Do you have a tattoo?

669
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:49,088
This isn't an ID number?

670
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:52,059
It is an ID number,

671
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:55,729
but it's just not for you.

672
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:59,733
It's an ID for this
whole area, Nic.

673
01:14:00,802 --> 01:14:05,671
Two, plus three,
plus five, plus 41.

674
01:14:07,108 --> 01:14:08,942
51.

675
01:14:09,043 --> 01:14:11,412
Area 51, Nic. We're in Area 51.

676
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:13,347
- Jonah, I'm not sure...
- No, look at your legs!

677
01:14:13,349 --> 01:14:15,681
I'm looking at my legs!

678
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:20,052
Watch. Empty.

679
01:14:22,056 --> 01:14:26,559
Everything is empty.
They're testing us, Nic.

680
01:14:26,561 --> 01:14:28,962
We're like little rats.

681
01:14:29,765 --> 01:14:32,667
Now, did you see the maps?

682
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:34,536
What are you talking
about, the maps?

683
01:14:34,537 --> 01:14:38,306
What are you telling me, it's
not real? Of course it's real.

684
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:42,242
There's roads, highways,
cities on these maps.

685
01:14:42,844 --> 01:14:45,345
They don't exist.

686
01:14:46,047 --> 01:14:49,417
We're trapped in a
huge government annex.

687
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:52,030
Did you meet any of
the charming locals?

688
01:14:52,032 --> 01:14:56,122
Jonah. Jonah, listen to me.

689
01:15:01,229 --> 01:15:05,367
Listen to me. Haley is
really, really sick.

690
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:08,970
Okay, we have to tell someone.
We have to tell someone.

691
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:12,939
- We have to expose this.
- I'm sick, too.

692
01:15:15,042 --> 01:15:18,578
It's hard to explain, but
there's something in me.

693
01:15:20,047 --> 01:15:24,783
There's something that is... It's like
they took something from me, Nic.

694
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:27,621
Took what?

695
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:31,123
I feel like I'm...

696
01:15:31,827 --> 01:15:34,627
I feel like I'm full of...

697
01:15:38,734 --> 01:15:41,234
- Gaps?
- Yes.

698
01:15:41,903 --> 01:15:43,971
That's exactly what it is.

699
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:47,109
I mean, not exactly, but,
you know, it's really close.

700
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:51,677
- So you know what I mean?
- Jonah, whose blood is that?

701
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,713
Is that yours?

702
01:16:01,155 --> 01:16:03,990
I was trying to get them off.

703
01:16:06,161 --> 01:16:09,029
I was trying to get them off.

704
01:16:14,368 --> 01:16:16,270
Hey, buddy.

705
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:20,175
We're gonna get somewhere where we can be
seen by as many people as possible, okay?

706
01:16:20,176 --> 01:16:24,211
- It's the only way to be safe.
- They won't come off.

707
01:16:26,047 --> 01:16:29,082
But how would we do that?

708
01:16:29,885 --> 01:16:33,720
From what I've seen, there's
only one road in here.

709
01:16:35,122 --> 01:16:37,957
Well, that's the one we take.

710
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:20,000
Okay, we're good. We're good.

711
01:17:40,555 --> 01:17:43,055
<i>Stop right there. Hold up.</i>

712
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:50,630
Hey, boss. We have
full clearance to pass.

713
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:54,833
<i>Check it out. Let's go.</i>

714
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:18,425
<i>- Step out of your vehicle, sir.
- No. That's okay.</i>

715
01:18:18,627 --> 01:18:21,360
<i>- It's time to go!
- Block him down. Block him down.</i>

716
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:25,731
Shit! Come on!

717
01:18:28,603 --> 01:18:30,369
Shit!

718
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:37,613
For God's sake, Nic! Stay
in the truck! Run, Nic!

719
01:18:39,614 --> 01:18:41,782
Jonah, what are you doing?

720
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:28,228
It doesn't fucking type!

721
01:20:36,631 --> 01:20:39,932
Jonah!

722
01:20:41,569 --> 01:20:43,703
Jonah!

723
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:51,978
Jonah, come on,
let's go! Get in the truck!

724
01:20:51,979 --> 01:20:53,881
Come on! Get back in!

725
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:57,684
- Jonah, get in the truck!
- I'm done. I'm done.

726
01:21:01,323 --> 01:21:03,057
Just get in the truck.

727
01:21:03,059 --> 01:21:07,527
Nic, keep up.

728
01:21:09,564 --> 01:21:12,030
Get in the truck.

729
01:21:13,167 --> 01:21:17,904
You put this shit on the
accelerator, go when I yell, "Go."

730
01:21:18,372 --> 01:21:20,439
You go, Nic.

731
01:21:21,342 --> 01:21:23,975
Okay, Nic?

732
01:21:26,948 --> 01:21:29,481
I need you to go.

733
01:21:30,752 --> 01:21:34,353
I need you to go. Please.

734
01:24:34,101 --> 01:24:36,403
Put your seatbelt on.

735
01:24:44,145 --> 01:24:46,845
- Nic, I think we should just...
- Hold on.

736
01:25:00,895 --> 01:25:03,195
Nic, stop!

737
01:25:31,059 --> 01:25:33,292
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

738
01:25:47,708 --> 01:25:50,076
I love you.

739
01:26:30,585 --> 01:26:33,351
Haley!

740
01:27:40,621 --> 01:27:43,155
Don't even think about it, Nic.

741
01:27:43,690 --> 01:27:45,891
You can't reach her.

742
01:27:53,967 --> 01:27:56,034
<i>On my side.</i>

743
01:27:59,506 --> 01:28:02,375
Take a look at yourself, Nic.

744
01:28:03,344 --> 01:28:08,311
The perfect integration
of human will and...

745
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:11,818
alien technology.

746
01:28:13,387 --> 01:28:15,988
Our finest achievement.

747
01:28:21,929 --> 01:28:23,930
Nomad?

748
01:28:26,434 --> 01:28:28,168
Nomad!

749
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:32,673
Nomad, yes. I brought you here.

750
01:28:32,675 --> 01:28:37,244
But remember, Nic, you were the
one who came looking for me.

751
01:28:37,246 --> 01:28:40,014
So you might want to ask yourself,

752
01:28:40,015 --> 01:28:44,817
"Did I find what
I was looking for?"
