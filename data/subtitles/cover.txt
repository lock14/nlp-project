2
00:02:47,022 --> 00:02:50,924
<i>Mr. Simmons! Do you have a confession?</i>

3
00:02:50,993 --> 00:02:52,927
There were three shots.

4
00:02:52,995 --> 00:02:56,658
One grazed the shoulder,
a shot to the body, slug to the head.

5
00:02:56,732 --> 00:02:59,223
It was a crime of passion.

6
00:02:59,301 --> 00:03:02,236
<i>Mr. Simmons, how is this case gonna
impact your political career?</i>

7
00:03:02,304 --> 00:03:05,967
We'll hold
a press conference shortly...

8
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,635
and I'll respond
to all your questions then.

9
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,146
<i>- Can you tell us anything else about the suspect?
- Are you guilty, Mrs. Mass?</i>

10
00:03:12,214 --> 00:03:17,083
Hey, Bill. Detective Hicks here will
assist with the interrogation.

11
00:03:17,152 --> 00:03:19,848
- You mean the lynching?
- Counselor Miller.

12
00:03:19,921 --> 00:03:22,947
Dwight. Listen, we all know
that you're up for your boss's job.

13
00:03:23,025 --> 00:03:27,257
But let me ask you a question-
Is the truth getting in the way here?

14
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:31,459
<i>Are we being recorded or videotaped?
If we are, I'm gonna suggest my client say nothing.</i>

15
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:34,161
Richard, don't make this thing complicated.

16
00:03:34,236 --> 00:03:37,000
We have a motive- infidelity.

17
00:03:37,072 --> 00:03:40,530
<i>Access to the murder scene.
Prints on the murder weapon.</i>

18
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:45,808
<i>Earrings- her earrings-
found at the scene. No alibi.</i>

19
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:49,282
We got the Holy Trinity-
probable cause, access, motive.

20
00:03:49,351 --> 00:03:52,013
Let's be reasonable here.
I'm willing to make a deal.

21
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:53,952
No deals.

22
00:03:54,022 --> 00:03:56,684
I'm innocent.

23
00:03:56,758 --> 00:04:00,216
I'm a Christian, not a murderer.

24
00:04:02,464 --> 00:04:06,992
Ah. Oh, Mr. Simmons,
I'm not the negotiator that you are...

25
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:10,334
<i>but would you mind letting me
have a few moments with Ms. Mass here?</i>

26
00:04:10,405 --> 00:04:14,398
<i>- Go ahead, Detective.
- Oh, I see. This is going to be a team effort.</i>

27
00:04:14,476 --> 00:04:17,809
I'm gonna need that confession.

28
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:20,473
- Time.
- Mm-hmm.

29
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:23,746
He's got a press conference.
We don't have a whole lot of time.

30
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:28,153
- That's not our problem.
- Oh, yeah, but it is. It is.

31
00:04:28,223 --> 00:04:30,214
Now, you playin'
the Christian card-

32
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:33,022
<i>good old God-fearin' black woman.</i>

33
00:04:33,095 --> 00:04:35,689
- Miss Spelman College.
- Don't patronize me.

34
00:04:35,764 --> 00:04:38,528
Hey, hey, hey. It's not me that you
should be worried about.

35
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,660
It's the jury that you
should be worried about.

36
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:45,172
With not the slightest
hint of remorse, confession...

37
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,041
that jury just might give
a spiritual woman like yourself...

38
00:04:50,112 --> 00:04:52,774
a free ticket to heaven-
courtesy of the state.

39
00:04:52,848 --> 00:04:55,783
<i>- Detective.
- Hmm?</i>

40
00:04:55,851 --> 00:04:59,548
- Do you go to church?
- Oh, yeah. C.M.E.

41
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:02,715
Christmas, Mother's Day and Easter.

42
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,191
<i>Valerie, you don't have
to respond to any of this.</i>

43
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,251
You're not on trial here.

44
00:05:08,597 --> 00:05:13,591
I'm not worried,
and I have nothin' to hide.

45
00:05:13,668 --> 00:05:16,068
But I must be allowed
to tell everything.

46
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:20,998
Fine.

47
00:05:23,378 --> 00:05:25,369
How long is everything gonna take?

48
00:05:26,815 --> 00:05:28,908
Before I was accused of murder...

49
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:33,344
before my family
was ripped apart-

50
00:05:39,828 --> 00:05:42,729
Aw, Philly's all right.

51
00:05:42,797 --> 00:05:44,765
Yeah, but I got big dreams,
you know?

52
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,926
Whoa!
The prettiest girl in the world.

53
00:05:47,002 --> 00:05:48,936
Huh?

54
00:05:49,004 --> 00:05:51,939
- Hey!
- What's up?

55
00:05:52,007 --> 00:05:53,998
<i>Hey, girl. Hey, Daddy.</i>

56
00:05:54,075 --> 00:05:56,168
- Everything good?
- Yes, girl.

57
00:05:56,244 --> 00:05:58,178
- Practically all moved in.
- Good.

58
00:05:58,246 --> 00:06:01,409
- So, how's the new place?
- Oh, it's nice. It's nice.

59
00:06:01,483 --> 00:06:03,576
- It ain't big-
- Watch out now.

60
00:06:03,652 --> 00:06:05,643
<i>It's not big, but you know.</i>

61
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,655
Girl, you deserve the best,
and that's exactly what you gonna get.

62
00:06:08,723 --> 00:06:11,658
What I need right now is a church.

63
00:06:11,726 --> 00:06:14,126
I told you, you are
gonna love Mercy Baptist.

64
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:16,926
- All right, well, I'm ready to go now.
- All right then.

65
00:06:16,998 --> 00:06:19,023
- I'm late for work. I'll hit you later.
- All right.

66
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,126
<i>Grandpa!
Are you helping us?</i>

67
00:06:22,204 --> 00:06:25,605
<i>- Shh! Forget that "Grandpa" stuff now.
- Go on inside.</i>

68
00:06:25,674 --> 00:06:27,039
Don't look at that.

69
00:06:27,108 --> 00:06:30,669
Daddy and Grandpa
are looking at B-U-T-T-S.

70
00:06:30,745 --> 00:06:32,770
- Whoa, whoa!
- Uh-huh.

71
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:36,681
It's nice that you had such a warm
and fuzzy reception, but is this relevant?

72
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:40,380
We're not gonna be railroaded just because
your boss has a press conference.

73
00:06:40,455 --> 00:06:43,856
Val, anything you say, they can take
and twist it any way that they want.

74
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:45,859
<i>A jury can be manipulated.</i>

75
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:47,986
I have nothing to hide.

76
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,032
And, yes, Detective Hicks,
everything I'm about to tell you-

77
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:53,533
it's all relevant.

78
00:06:53,602 --> 00:06:56,230
So, I took a look at your portfolio. Looks good.

79
00:06:56,304 --> 00:06:58,670
<i>I'm gonna recommend you for some
photo shoots we got comin' up.</i>

80
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,004
- Are you serious?
- Am I serious?

81
00:07:01,076 --> 00:07:03,067
- Don't play with me.
- I ain't playin' with you.

82
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:05,977
Chill it out. It's nothin' immediate.

83
00:07:06,047 --> 00:07:09,244
<i>- But I'm definitely down for hookin' my girl up.
- All right.</i>

84
00:07:09,317 --> 00:07:12,411
That's a real sacrifice-you givin' up
your studio for your husband's career.

85
00:07:12,487 --> 00:07:15,081
You're so old-fashioned.

86
00:07:15,156 --> 00:07:18,614
Well, I love my husband.

87
00:07:18,693 --> 00:07:21,059
And, Zahara, he's worth it.

88
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:24,496
- What's up, baby?
- Dog! You see there?

89
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:26,659
All men are dogs.
All they need are fleas.

90
00:07:26,735 --> 00:07:28,669
And I met one last week
who had some.

91
00:07:28,737 --> 00:07:31,672
So tell me about
Mercy Baptist, girl.

92
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,674
Oh, it's a nice church.

93
00:07:33,742 --> 00:07:37,041
Reverend Dunn and his wife, they don't
just talk the talk. They walk the walk.

94
00:07:37,112 --> 00:07:40,047
<i>They feed homeless folks,
teach H.I. V. prevention.</i>

95
00:07:40,115 --> 00:07:44,848
<i>- Monday nights-women's group.
Fabulous. You must join us.
- I'll be there.</i>

96
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:47,513
Now, Reverend Dunn starts
Sunday services at 10:00 a.m. sharp.

97
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:49,716
So none of that Delta C.T.P. time.

98
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:53,784
<i>No. C.P. time.</i>

99
00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:55,853
<i>And you can't say it right
'cause you're wrong.</i>

100
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,558
You never would've made it to class
on time if it weren't for me.

101
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:02,262
<i>- Whatever, Miss Delta.
- That's right, "crimson and cream'"baby.</i>

102
00:08:02,337 --> 00:08:05,932
<i>Uh-uh. Pink and green-girls with the pearls.</i>

103
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:09,238
- Dog!
- Girl, he didn't say nothin' to you.

104
00:08:09,311 --> 00:08:13,213
He was thinkin' 'bout it.

105
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:15,943
For Dutch...

106
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:18,417
the move from Atlanta
was no big deal.

107
00:08:18,486 --> 00:08:21,080
You know,
he grew up in Philadelphia.

108
00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:24,549
But for me...

109
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:27,459
it was a place where all
our dreams would come true.

110
00:08:30,865 --> 00:08:33,732
It never occurred to me
that nightmares are dreams too.

111
00:08:33,802 --> 00:08:38,637
"'W hat do we have here? ' snarled the huge wolf."

112
00:08:38,707 --> 00:08:41,198
- Not good enough.
- What?

113
00:08:41,276 --> 00:08:43,210
- I'm warning you.
- Mm-mmm.

114
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:48,409
Come on. " 'W hat do we have here? '
snarled the huge wolf."

115
00:08:50,685 --> 00:08:53,313
Not good enough.

116
00:08:53,388 --> 00:08:56,255
- I think we need to-
- Yeah.

117
00:08:56,324 --> 00:08:58,792
One, two-

118
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,794
- What? Come on.
- three!

119
00:09:00,862 --> 00:09:02,887
Come on.

120
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:06,056
I put the gun in my mouth.

121
00:09:08,136 --> 00:09:11,469
I started to... pull the trigger.

122
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:20,045
I saw my daughter's face... crying.

123
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:26,751
Then I realized...

124
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:28,812
how selfish I was being.

125
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:34,189
Some days, everything matters.

126
00:09:34,262 --> 00:09:36,822
Some days, nothin' matters.

127
00:09:39,634 --> 00:09:41,625
I want you
to make a commitment-

128
00:09:41,703 --> 00:09:43,967
every day for the next 30 days.

129
00:09:44,038 --> 00:09:46,472
Deal?

130
00:09:49,778 --> 00:09:52,212
I'll see you tomorrow, same time.

131
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,748
- Thank you, Doctor.
- My pleasure.

132
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,915
- Monica.
- Dutch. Good to see you.

133
00:10:02,991 --> 00:10:05,721
- I'm sorry I wasn't here when you arrived.
- Oh.

134
00:10:05,794 --> 00:10:09,321
I was at a conference. I'm late for
a meeting, but I need to talk to you.

135
00:10:09,397 --> 00:10:12,764
- Can you walk with me?
- Yeah. Yeah.

136
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:15,268
It appears your time
at Oxford has paid off.

137
00:10:15,336 --> 00:10:18,703
You've even picked up an accent.
Good for business.

138
00:10:18,773 --> 00:10:21,435
I know a mind
is a terrible thing to waste.

139
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:23,704
- How are you and Kevin?
- Miserable, as usual.

140
00:10:23,778 --> 00:10:25,769
But I might as well
get to the point.

141
00:10:25,847 --> 00:10:28,077
We won't be able to pay
the salary you requested.

142
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:30,617
I "requested"? Oh, you mean
the salary you promised me.

143
00:10:30,685 --> 00:10:32,585
No one's deceived you.
The offer was-

144
00:10:32,654 --> 00:10:36,181
I moved my family up here from Atlanta.
Now you're telling me there's no money?

145
00:10:36,257 --> 00:10:38,088
Every contract has contingencies-

146
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,286
subject to pending grants
and all the fine print.

147
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:42,727
But that's beside the point.
I want you here.

148
00:10:42,797 --> 00:10:45,231
And I will do everything in my power
to keep you here.

149
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,291
Like old times, right?

150
00:10:49,003 --> 00:10:52,268
Monica, that's inappropriate.
I'm happily married.

151
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,741
- Happily, so am I.
- To one of my best friends.

152
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:59,610
As if Kevin would mind.
Nothing's changed.

153
00:10:59,681 --> 00:11:02,013
We need to have
this conversation later.

154
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,074
Come to our surprise
anniversary party.

155
00:11:04,152 --> 00:11:06,746
It's Sunday afternoon
at the Academy of Fine Arts.

156
00:11:06,821 --> 00:11:09,415
How can it be a surprise
when you already know about it?

157
00:11:09,491 --> 00:11:12,358
There are no secrets between us, Dutch.
You know that.

158
00:11:12,427 --> 00:11:14,418
Ryan Chambers is hosting it for us.

159
00:11:14,496 --> 00:11:16,589
I'm sorry.
We go to church on Sunday.

160
00:11:16,664 --> 00:11:19,929
Your presence is required,
not requested, Dr. Mass.

161
00:11:20,969 --> 00:11:23,062
<i>#Praise the Lord #</i>

162
00:11:23,137 --> 00:11:25,264

00:11:32,714 --> 00:11:37,742
# O Lord, come by me #

167
00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:40,515
Whoo! Yeah! Come on! Sing! Yeah!

168
00:11:40,588 --> 00:11:42,351
<i># Yeah #</i>

169
00:11:46,895 --> 00:11:48,920
Hallelujah!

170
00:11:48,997 --> 00:11:51,761
- Thank God!
- # Ooh #

171
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,858
<i>Praise God!</i>

172
00:11:53,935 --> 00:11:56,369
- Let the church say "Amen!"
- Amen!

173
00:11:56,437 --> 00:11:58,132
<i>- Yes!
- Hallelujah!</i>

174
00:11:58,206 --> 00:12:02,768
I'm talkin' about the land
of the designer walk and the designer talk.

175
00:12:02,844 --> 00:12:06,780
<i>The designer gowns
and the designer frowns.</i>

176
00:12:06,848 --> 00:12:11,217
Designer husbands, designer wives.

177
00:12:11,286 --> 00:12:13,846
Designer smiles, designer styles.

178
00:12:13,922 --> 00:12:17,881
<i>All designed by the one who knows...</i>

179
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:21,360
the weakness of the flesh
is temptation.

180
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:25,331
<i>The flesh may call your name...</i>

181
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,834
but only God can call your soul!

182
00:12:30,872 --> 00:12:33,238
<i>Only God can call your soul!</i>

183
00:12:35,243 --> 00:12:39,009
<i>- Yes! Surrender, rich man.
- Hallelujah!</i>

184
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,605
Surrender, poor man.

185
00:12:41,683 --> 00:12:45,551
Surrender, beggar man.
Surrender, thief.

186
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,088
<i>- Praise the Lord!
- Surrender.</i>

187
00:12:48,156 --> 00:12:52,252
When God calls you, surrender,
adulterer.

188
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:54,261
Surrender, liar.

189
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:58,322
<i>Surrender, kings,
the presidents and Indian chiefs.</i>

190
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,663
<i>- Amen!
- Surrender!</i>

191
00:13:00,735 --> 00:13:05,297
<i>- The time is drawing near for you to surrender.
- Glory be to God!</i>

192
00:13:05,373 --> 00:13:07,671
Surrender.

193
00:13:07,742 --> 00:13:10,575
- Thank you, Heavenly Father.
- Yes.

194
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:15,981
Now, anyone who wants
to join the church this morning...

195
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,076
please come down to the altar.

196
00:13:19,153 --> 00:13:21,951
Let him know.
Let him know.

197
00:13:22,023 --> 00:13:24,514
<i>- Yes, God!
- Let him know.</i>

198
00:13:24,592 --> 00:13:28,551
Whoever you are, let him know.
Come down.

199
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,190
Come on, Dutch.
You ready? Let's go.

200
00:13:31,265 --> 00:13:33,392
- I'm not goin'.
- Why not?

201
00:13:33,468 --> 00:13:36,403
- I just can't.
- Dutch.

202
00:13:36,471 --> 00:13:39,804
- Go.
- Is Daddy coming?

203
00:13:39,874 --> 00:13:43,537
<i>- Daddy's gonna come next time.
- Those of you in pain.</i>

204
00:13:43,611 --> 00:13:47,047
<i>- Those of you in confusion.
- Hallelujah.</i>

205
00:13:47,115 --> 00:13:52,075
<i>- Amen!
- Those of you in deceit and despair.</i>

206
00:13:58,326 --> 00:14:00,817
<i>Dutch, I'm not thinking about this right now.</i>

207
00:14:00,895 --> 00:14:02,886
I can't believe you did that today.

208
00:14:02,964 --> 00:14:06,127
There you go. Faith won't pay the bills.

209
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,862
What does that have
to do with you joining church?

210
00:14:08,936 --> 00:14:11,336
Do we have to talk
about this now, here?

211
00:14:11,406 --> 00:14:13,931
You don't want me to embarrass you
in front of your little friends?

212
00:14:14,008 --> 00:14:16,533
Yeah, that's right.
Can we drop it please?

213
00:14:16,611 --> 00:14:20,138
All right, I'll leave it alone.
I won't say nothin' else about it.

214
00:14:20,214 --> 00:14:25,777
<i>- Hey, Monica. How you doin'?
- That is you. Mmm!</i>

215
00:14:25,853 --> 00:14:30,449
- This is Val, my beautiful wife.
- I'm so glad to finally get to meet you, Val.

216
00:14:30,525 --> 00:14:33,926
It's nice to meet you too. Dutch is always
telling me about the good times...

217
00:14:33,995 --> 00:14:36,486
you, Ryan and Kevin
had back in school.

218
00:14:36,564 --> 00:14:40,125
Well, we used to say, " A party ain't
a party until Dutch Mass shows up."

219
00:14:40,201 --> 00:14:42,362
Oh? Well, happy anniversary to you.

220
00:14:42,437 --> 00:14:44,530
Fifteen years of heaven and hell.

221
00:14:44,605 --> 00:14:46,539
There's my husband.

222
00:14:46,607 --> 00:14:48,598
He's crazy.

223
00:14:48,676 --> 00:14:51,543
- Hi, baby.
- Hey. What's happenin', man?

224
00:14:51,612 --> 00:14:54,775
- Good to see you, man. This is Val.
- Good to see you.

225
00:14:54,849 --> 00:14:57,340
Hello, Val.
Great to meet you.

226
00:14:57,418 --> 00:14:59,852
We had to work very hard
to get your husband up here...

227
00:14:59,921 --> 00:15:03,152
but, uh, Atlanta's loss
is definitely Philly's gain.

228
00:15:03,224 --> 00:15:06,022
I like that color on you.
Takes a real man to pull that off.

229
00:15:06,094 --> 00:15:08,654
<i>Thanks.</i>

230
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:11,995
Hey, I'm going to the sculpture garden.
Anybody wanna come with?

231
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:15,001
Dutch isn't going anywhere
until he dances with me first.

232
00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:17,333
Ooh. I would not disobey
those orders, Doctor.

233
00:15:17,405 --> 00:15:19,873
See you.

234
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:23,707
Val, hey, welcome to Philadelphia...

235
00:15:23,778 --> 00:15:26,338
City of Brotherly Love.

236
00:15:26,414 --> 00:15:28,678
<i>Okay.</i>

237
00:15:30,118 --> 00:15:32,643
- How are you?
- I'm not much of a dancer, so I'm gonna-

238
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,382
Perfect. Then I'll teach you.
Do you mind, Val?

239
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:37,390
No, no, no.
That's all right.

240
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,722
Y'all go ahead. Have a good time.

241
00:15:41,596 --> 00:15:45,259
<i>So you must be the lovely Ms. Dutch Mass.</i>

242
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:48,325
- Ryan Chambers.
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Ryan.

243
00:15:48,402 --> 00:15:50,597
- This is Cynda. She works for me.
- Pleasure to meet you.

244
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:54,038
- You too.
- Why don't you go get me
a drink for 10 minutes, okay?

245
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:56,576
- The usual?
- The usual.

246
00:15:56,644 --> 00:15:58,942
- What do you do, Mrs. Mass?
- I'm a photographer.

247
00:15:59,013 --> 00:16:01,607
- So you love beautiful things.
- Yeah, I do.

248
00:16:01,682 --> 00:16:04,674
- So do I.
- Mmm.

249
00:16:04,752 --> 00:16:07,516
<i>Death on a Pale Horse.
Love it.</i>

250
00:16:07,588 --> 00:16:10,682
My favorite image
is the lion attacking. You?

251
00:16:10,758 --> 00:16:12,749
I don't really have a favorite part.

252
00:16:12,827 --> 00:16:14,768
I guess I like the whole thing.

253
00:16:14,902 --> 00:16:17,029
I bet you do.

254
00:16:17,104 --> 00:16:20,369
What?

255
00:16:20,441 --> 00:16:22,739
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Ryan.

256
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,608
But I just love that song
off your last album.

257
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,375
What song?
There's a lot of songs on that album.

258
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:31,646
- #When-# No, I can't sing.
- Just let me have a little bit.

259
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:34,711
- #What you gonna do when they-#
- # Hurt you #

260
00:16:34,788 --> 00:16:37,586
#Where you gonna go
when they lie to you #

261
00:16:37,658 --> 00:16:40,855
#Who you gonna call
then run to #

262
00:16:40,928 --> 00:16:43,488
#When you know your life ain't right ##

263
00:16:43,564 --> 00:16:46,328
So, uh, you and Dutch ever dance to me?

264
00:16:47,468 --> 00:16:50,528
Um, Dutch and I dance
to a lot of your music.

265
00:16:50,604 --> 00:16:53,198
Right.

266
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:55,833
<i>Stop it.</i>

267
00:16:58,412 --> 00:17:00,710
Monica, come on. Stop it.

268
00:17:00,781 --> 00:17:04,273
- So tell me. How long you know Monica?
- We just met.

269
00:17:04,351 --> 00:17:06,046
Let's dance.

270
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,055
So, Dutch told me that you,
him and Kevin...

271
00:17:09,123 --> 00:17:11,591
were like the Three Musketeers
back in the day.

272
00:17:11,658 --> 00:17:14,183
Yeah. The scholar,
the baller and the flirt.

273
00:17:14,261 --> 00:17:17,924
So, now, you are the scholar?

274
00:17:17,998 --> 00:17:20,933
Guess again, baby.

275
00:17:23,637 --> 00:17:28,973
<i># Wish I could find the right girl #</i>

276
00:17:31,412 --> 00:17:33,277
You ever wonder why Ryan Chambers...

277
00:17:33,347 --> 00:17:38,011
would hit on a Southern belle
like yourself?

278
00:17:38,085 --> 00:17:41,748
- At the time, yes.
- Love 'em or leave 'em.

279
00:17:41,822 --> 00:17:43,983
You know what they say
about a woman scorned.

280
00:17:44,057 --> 00:17:46,048
The same thing they say about
an assistant D.A. running for office.

281
00:17:46,126 --> 00:17:49,323
<i>Could we get on with this, please,
Detective?</i>

282
00:17:49,396 --> 00:17:53,059
<i>- I knew something was wrong.
I just didn't know what.
- Ah.</i>

283
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:55,465
<i>Hey, Val, come on.</i>

284
00:17:55,536 --> 00:17:58,562
Boy, I'm coming.

285
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:03,108
- You can't rush perfection.
- I know that's right.

286
00:18:03,177 --> 00:18:05,168
- Patience.
- That's a virtue, right?

287
00:18:05,245 --> 00:18:08,043
That's right. Patience.

288
00:18:08,115 --> 00:18:11,516
Uh-oh.

289
00:18:11,585 --> 00:18:13,985
Where did you and Monica go?

290
00:18:14,054 --> 00:18:16,682
Come on.

291
00:18:16,757 --> 00:18:19,123
We didn't go anywhere.
I told you.

292
00:18:19,193 --> 00:18:22,754
I went outside to the sculpture garden
with Kevin and the fellas.

293
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,821
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, right.

294
00:18:24,898 --> 00:18:27,833
Who's the one there dancin'
all close with Ryan Chambers?

295
00:18:27,901 --> 00:18:30,836
- Oh, please!
- Yeah. That's all right.

296
00:18:30,904 --> 00:18:34,271
- Jealousy is a strong aphrodisiac.
- Look at you.

297
00:18:34,341 --> 00:18:37,003
- Baby, come on.
- Mm-hmm. You on my list.

298
00:18:37,077 --> 00:18:39,671
Yes, I wanna know
why you didn't join church today.

299
00:18:39,746 --> 00:18:42,840
- I'll join next week. Move your arm.
- You gonna join next week?

300
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,680
- You said we wasn't gonna talk about that again.
- I lied.

301
00:18:45,752 --> 00:18:48,050
- I will join next week.
- Not because I told you.

302
00:18:48,121 --> 00:18:50,214
Val, why you gotta
ruin the mood like this?

303
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,020
It's important. I wanna know
if somethin' bothering you.

304
00:18:53,093 --> 00:18:56,290
Nothing is bothering me. I was in
a good mood until you started all this.

305
00:18:56,363 --> 00:18:58,661
What is that supposed to mean?

306
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:03,300
Noth-Nothing.
Nothin'. I'm-

307
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,533
I got a lot on my mind right now
with the pay cut and everything.

308
00:19:06,607 --> 00:19:09,508
I'm just, you know-
I'm trying to figure some things out.

309
00:19:10,744 --> 00:19:12,735
We can tighten it up.

310
00:19:13,981 --> 00:19:15,972
I'll skip a few pedicures.

311
00:19:20,721 --> 00:19:22,712
Baby, how would you feel-

312
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,350
You know...

313
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:28,724
what would you think if-

314
00:19:32,432 --> 00:19:36,198
- if- if, you know, like-
- What is it, baby?

315
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,707
Maybe I'm not the man...
you think I am, you know?

316
00:19:42,075 --> 00:19:44,600
The man you want me to be.

317
00:19:44,678 --> 00:19:48,409
Maybe I'm not always the woman
you want me to be either.

318
00:19:48,482 --> 00:19:52,213
Come here.
Look at me.

319
00:19:52,286 --> 00:19:55,187
No matter what happens...

320
00:19:55,255 --> 00:19:57,280
you know that I love you, right?

321
00:19:57,357 --> 00:20:00,417
You know?

322
00:20:00,494 --> 00:20:02,894
Dutch, wait a minute, baby.
You're scaring me.

323
00:20:04,865 --> 00:20:07,356
- Is somethin' wrong?
- No.

324
00:20:08,602 --> 00:20:12,561
No. No.

325
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:14,869
Man, I'm sorry.

326
00:20:14,942 --> 00:20:17,137
No, nothin'.

327
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,144
It's the champagne talking, baby.

328
00:20:21,281 --> 00:20:23,215
I love you, Dutch.

329
00:20:23,283 --> 00:20:25,376
I love you more.

330
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:43,001
<i>Good evening, ladies.</i>

331
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:47,769
- Let's welcome Mrs. Mass to our
Women's Faith Fellowship.
- Yes.

332
00:20:47,841 --> 00:20:51,277
I just want to say
how grateful I am to be here.

333
00:20:51,345 --> 00:20:54,007
I'm a guest
of my good friend Zahara.

334
00:20:54,081 --> 00:20:58,017
Me and my husband, Dutch, and my daughter,
Nicole, just moved up here from Atlanta.

335
00:20:58,085 --> 00:21:00,883
<i>And I just wanna say how grateful
I am to meet all you ladies...</i>

336
00:21:00,954 --> 00:21:04,481
<i>and how grateful I am, more than anything,
to be back in the house of the Lord.</i>

337
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:07,618
<i>- Amen! Amen!
- And I give God all the glory and all the praise.</i>

338
00:21:07,694 --> 00:21:10,094
Amen!

339
00:21:10,163 --> 00:21:12,256
I am Mrs. Persons.
I would like to welcome you.

340
00:21:12,332 --> 00:21:14,197
Tell me.
What does your husband do?

341
00:21:14,267 --> 00:21:16,963
- He's a psychiatrist.
- I might need him.

342
00:21:17,037 --> 00:21:19,164
Praise the Lord.

343
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:21,230
Now, the topic
for this evening, ladies...

344
00:21:21,308 --> 00:21:26,439
is how to-within our faith- deal with
spousal cheating in a constructive way.

345
00:21:26,513 --> 00:21:28,208
Yes, Miss Gladys.

346
00:21:28,281 --> 00:21:32,650
My husband cheated on me one time
with some filthy Jezebel.

347
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:35,244
<i>- I snatched that heifer bald.
- Mm-hmm!</i>

348
00:21:35,322 --> 00:21:38,723
Her dog tried to bite me.
I snatched the dog bald too.

349
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:41,522
- Amen!
- Let's remember two things, ladies.

350
00:21:41,595 --> 00:21:45,224
Let's find constructive responses,
and let's keep God in this.

351
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:47,289
- Amen.
- Yes, Miss Honeycomb?

352
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:51,030
- I kept God in it- sent my husband to meet him.
- Amen.

353
00:21:51,104 --> 00:21:56,599
<i>He cheated on me, so I went down
to Miss Dashon down in Chinatown...</i>

354
00:21:56,677 --> 00:22:00,010
got some of that
strong dust pepper...

355
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,878
<i>mixed it in his mashed potatoes.</i>

356
00:22:02,949 --> 00:22:06,476
- He was null and void.
- Null and void.

357
00:22:06,553 --> 00:22:09,021
His head could not lift
from the pillow.

358
00:22:09,089 --> 00:22:10,818
<i>He didn't know what happened to him.</i>

359
00:22:10,891 --> 00:22:15,225
<i>But after that, he ain't cheat on me no more.</i>

360
00:22:15,295 --> 00:22:17,354
<i>- Amen to that.
- Constructive responses, Miss Honeycomb.</i>

361
00:22:17,431 --> 00:22:21,265
- May I help you?
- Excuse me. Sorry I'm late.

362
00:22:21,334 --> 00:22:23,768
I'm sorry.
The men's meeting is Thursday.

363
00:22:23,837 --> 00:22:25,896
I told you this was a bad idea.

364
00:22:25,972 --> 00:22:28,440
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come.
- Greg, wait.

365
00:22:28,508 --> 00:22:31,170
Mrs. Dunn, I'm sorry.
Greg's my guest.

366
00:22:31,244 --> 00:22:34,941
He didn't want to come, but I insisted.
I told him that he would be more than welcome.

367
00:22:35,015 --> 00:22:36,880
- We beg your pardon.
- Yes, he-

368
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,611
<i>- That's a group decision.
- Sure is.</i>

369
00:22:38,685 --> 00:22:41,449
I know, but Greg has something
that he needs to discuss...

370
00:22:41,521 --> 00:22:43,716
that can't wait until Thursday.

371
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,553
His significant other just left him.

372
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:48,856
- Significant other?
- Boyfriend.

373
00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:52,194
- Oh, help us, Jesus.
- If my presence offends anybody, I'll go.

374
00:22:52,265 --> 00:22:54,130
Nobody said anything
about being offended.

375
00:22:54,201 --> 00:22:57,534
<i>- This is supposed to be a women's meetin'.
- Sure is.</i>

376
00:22:57,604 --> 00:22:59,538
- Tolerance, ladies.
- Compassion.

377
00:22:59,606 --> 00:23:03,372
Let's remember.
We are all children of God, including Greg.

378
00:23:03,443 --> 00:23:06,810
<i>Now, Greg, the question is,
would you feel comfortable here?</i>

379
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,907
- Feels just like my family.
- Welcome, Greg. Ladies.

380
00:23:10,984 --> 00:23:12,383
<i>- Welcome, Greg.
- Welcome, darlin'.</i>

381
00:23:12,452 --> 00:23:14,750
- Welcome.
- Huh!

382
00:23:14,821 --> 00:23:18,086
<i>So, Greg, would you care to share with us?</i>

383
00:23:18,158 --> 00:23:21,389
<i>Take your time.</i>

384
00:23:21,461 --> 00:23:24,055
The thing that hurts the most-

385
00:23:24,131 --> 00:23:27,100
is the betrayal.

386
00:23:27,167 --> 00:23:29,795
<i>We got engaged a year ago...</i>

387
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,431
<i>and all that time, he was cheating on me...</i>

388
00:23:33,507 --> 00:23:36,499
with another man- a younger man.

389
00:23:36,576 --> 00:23:39,511
And I never saw it.
I still love him.

390
00:23:39,579 --> 00:23:42,013
Oh, help us, Jesus.

391
00:23:42,082 --> 00:23:44,107
What is this church
comin' to, Mrs. Dunn?

392
00:23:44,184 --> 00:23:46,675
Now, if you can't
share with the group- Ladies.

393
00:23:49,256 --> 00:23:52,157
I'm sorry, Greg.
May God bless you, son.

394
00:23:52,225 --> 00:23:56,753
My son, uh, Randy-
He just came out of the closet.

395
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:00,425
- Do you know him?
- Good Lord! It's spreadin' all over the church.

396
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,958
<i>We came here this evening
to talk about infidelity.</i>

397
00:24:04,037 --> 00:24:07,029
Can we please stick to that topic?

398
00:24:07,107 --> 00:24:10,474
Charlotte, it's your turn.
Do you have anything to say?

399
00:24:10,544 --> 00:24:13,945
- Hmm!
- May we bow our heads in a word of prayer.

400
00:24:14,014 --> 00:24:17,506
- Heavenly Father, we come before you-
- Mm-mmm.

401
00:24:17,651 --> 00:24:20,142
I'm gonna make you
an offer, Mrs. Mass.

402
00:24:21,454 --> 00:24:24,014
Now, I am willing
to recommend clemency.

403
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,719
Lethal injection is not
the only way to go here.

404
00:24:27,794 --> 00:24:30,627
A confession made
in the spirit of remorse...

405
00:24:30,697 --> 00:24:32,631
is very persuasive with a jury...

406
00:24:32,699 --> 00:24:34,963
and with
the district attorney's office.

407
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,468
<i>Thirty-first floor.</i>

408
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,984
<i>Mrs. Mass.</i>

409
00:25:13,673 --> 00:25:16,904
- Hey.
- What was that about?

410
00:25:16,977 --> 00:25:18,968
I don't know what it is with Monica.

411
00:25:19,045 --> 00:25:21,411
She trippin' all the time.

412
00:25:21,481 --> 00:25:24,575
- Did you ever date Monica?
- Hmm?

413
00:25:26,453 --> 00:25:29,718
I didn't stutter.
Did you date Monica?

414
00:25:31,858 --> 00:25:34,383
A long time ago.
Nothin' special.

415
00:25:34,461 --> 00:25:37,362
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

416
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,694
We had an agreement.

417
00:25:39,766 --> 00:25:42,735
And suddenly you can't deal? Huh?

418
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:45,430
<i>- Suddenly? Suddenly, Kevin?
- Suddenly, you-</i>

419
00:25:45,505 --> 00:25:47,905
I didn't change, okay?

420
00:25:47,974 --> 00:25:50,272
Monica, I didn't change.

421
00:25:50,343 --> 00:25:53,210
- I've changed.
- Then you need to change back.

422
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,977
Okay? We have a perfect life.
We have money. We have freedom.

423
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:00,213
And now you are miserable.
You are hysterical.

424
00:26:00,287 --> 00:26:02,619
But, Kevin...

425
00:26:02,689 --> 00:26:05,556
I want kids.

426
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:09,391
<i>I want a normal life.
I want a family.</i>

427
00:26:11,097 --> 00:26:13,793
<i>I want a husband who wants me.</i>

428
00:26:13,867 --> 00:26:15,801
I want you.

429
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:19,498
I love you. I love you.

430
00:26:21,808 --> 00:26:23,799
You know I do, but this...

431
00:26:25,645 --> 00:26:27,636
normal thing, I just-

432
00:26:27,714 --> 00:26:30,274
I'm tired.

433
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,580
<i>You're tired?</i>

434
00:26:32,652 --> 00:26:35,746
- I'm so tired.
- You're gonna have to stick to the agreement.

435
00:26:35,822 --> 00:26:38,985
It just seems like-

436
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:42,119
<i>- l-
- You're always a victim.</i>

437
00:26:42,195 --> 00:26:45,323
<i>Ev-Ev-Everything just revolves around you, right?</i>

438
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:48,094
Keys. I'll drive.

439
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:53,769
Get out of the car.
Give me the keys.

440
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,933
<i>Monica?</i>

441
00:26:56,009 --> 00:26:58,204
<i>I'm gonna drive. Just-</i>

442
00:26:58,278 --> 00:27:00,473
I'll drive.

443
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:05,014
Baby? Co-Come on and get in the car.

444
00:27:05,085 --> 00:27:07,315
Monica?

445
00:27:08,955 --> 00:27:11,321
Hey! Stop!

446
00:27:11,391 --> 00:27:12,790
God, no!

447
00:27:15,562 --> 00:27:17,621
The ambulance stopped just in time.

448
00:27:17,697 --> 00:27:20,222
She tried to kill herself, man.

449
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,359
Look, she's got a lot
of narcotics in her system.

450
00:27:22,435 --> 00:27:25,768
You know that conference that she attended?
She was in treatment.

451
00:27:28,341 --> 00:27:31,970
I realized tonight
how selfish I've been-

452
00:27:32,045 --> 00:27:35,378
not just to her, also to you.

453
00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:39,049
Hey, I got some good news.

454
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:41,053
The, uh, grant came through
at the hospital.

455
00:27:41,121 --> 00:27:43,988
- They're gonna give you a raise.
- Oh, thank God.

456
00:27:44,057 --> 00:27:47,220
And I'm gonna give you something that
you deserve but you can't afford just yet.

457
00:27:47,293 --> 00:27:50,091
I've got a piece of property
up in Chestnut Hill.

458
00:27:50,163 --> 00:27:53,894
Very upscale, nice schools.
Big house.

459
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:56,765
You know, financially,
I can't even think about-

460
00:27:56,836 --> 00:27:59,134
Don't worry. I'm gonna cover
the down payment.

461
00:27:59,205 --> 00:28:01,469
You're gonna take care
of the monthly nut.

462
00:28:01,541 --> 00:28:07,343
Just consider it a...
long-term lease.

463
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:12,108
Kevin, you don't have to do this.

464
00:28:12,185 --> 00:28:14,813
You've done so much for me,
and you've done so much for Monica.

465
00:28:14,888 --> 00:28:17,322
- Without your counseling, l-
- Hey.

466
00:28:19,492 --> 00:28:22,052
You and I go back a long way, right?

467
00:28:25,265 --> 00:28:28,234
Hey, Dutch.
Don't give up the dream.

468
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:35,408
- I got a surprise for you.
- What? What is it?

469
00:28:35,475 --> 00:28:38,137
Now, if I tell you,
it's not a surprise.

470
00:28:38,211 --> 00:28:40,202
How about givin' me a hint?

471
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,216
Now, let's just say some
of our dreams are about to come true.

472
00:28:46,653 --> 00:28:50,145
- I want a hot dog.
- Oh, yeah?

473
00:28:50,223 --> 00:28:53,249
<i>- I'll go get the hot dog.
- Oh, I'll have a 20.
- No.</i>

474
00:28:53,326 --> 00:28:56,318
- Why don't you just give me our wallet?
- Yeah, you got that right.

475
00:28:56,396 --> 00:28:58,591
- Have fun.
- You're it!

476
00:28:59,966 --> 00:29:02,298
I felt like we were movin'
in the right direction.

477
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,476
<i>As my dearly departed mama used to say...</i>

478
00:29:12,545 --> 00:29:15,708
"You wanna make God laugh?

479
00:29:15,782 --> 00:29:17,807
<i>Tell him your plans."</i>

480
00:29:17,884 --> 00:29:20,352
My feet are too quick.

481
00:29:21,387 --> 00:29:24,015
- Did you confront him?
- No.

482
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:27,116
You found a condom
in your husband's wallet, and you didn't-

483
00:29:27,193 --> 00:29:30,492
<i>- She said no.
- He's a doctor.</i>

484
00:29:30,563 --> 00:29:33,293
<i>Sometimes he-he lectures
patients on safe sex.</i>

485
00:29:33,366 --> 00:29:36,597
<i>He-He- He passes out condoms.</i>

486
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,470
What do you think?

487
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:41,871
- She didn't wanna know.
- Mmm.

488
00:29:41,941 --> 00:29:45,035
<i>- Everything changed after that.
- Uh-huh.</i>

489
00:29:45,111 --> 00:29:48,979
<i>Me, I wouldn't trust him
as far as I could throw him.</i>

490
00:29:49,048 --> 00:29:51,209
I'm just bein' real, Val.
I smell a rat.

491
00:29:51,284 --> 00:29:53,445
<i>You should have him followed.</i>

492
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,387
I know this real good private detective-
same one I used on my ex.

493
00:29:56,456 --> 00:29:59,823
Now, Zahara, you know that Dutch
is not that kind of a person.

494
00:29:59,893 --> 00:30:03,192
<i>What's the name of that heifer
had herself a breakdown- Monica?</i>

495
00:30:03,263 --> 00:30:05,356
<i>That was a straight-up play
for sympathy.</i>

496
00:30:05,431 --> 00:30:07,296
I saw that crap from a mile away.

497
00:30:07,367 --> 00:30:10,495
- It was a nervous breakdown.
- Breakdown, "snakedown."

498
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,198
Heifer'd do anything
for a little attention.

499
00:30:13,273 --> 00:30:16,572
I knew this girl, stuck her hand
down a garbage disposal-

500
00:30:16,643 --> 00:30:19,111
<i>halfway cut her fingers off,
cried for two weeks.</i>

501
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:21,409
Her husband bought her
a new house and a car.

502
00:30:21,481 --> 00:30:23,847
<i>I been thinkin' about
cuttin' my fingers off.</i>

503
00:30:23,917 --> 00:30:27,216
I just cannot get that condom
out of my head.

504
00:30:27,287 --> 00:30:32,122
- Lord, why did I find it?
- You trippin'. You lucky you did.

505
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,387
You just gotta get your mind off it.
That's all.

506
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,894
- What is the chance of that happening?
- Knowin' you- slim and none.

507
00:30:36,963 --> 00:30:40,490
- Thank you.
- Hey, we handlin' this new lifestyle piece at work-

508
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:43,434
rich celebrities kickin' it
in their bling-bling homes.

509
00:30:43,503 --> 00:30:45,164
We could use another photographer.

510
00:30:45,238 --> 00:30:49,197
That's right. I got you-
on both fronts.

511
00:30:49,275 --> 00:30:54,736
- What you mean on both fronts?
- I said I'm watchin' Dutch.

512
00:30:54,814 --> 00:30:58,545
- So, you had your husband followed.
- She did not say that.

513
00:30:58,618 --> 00:31:01,382
- I did not have him followed.
- But you let it happen.

514
00:31:01,454 --> 00:31:03,354
<i>She's not responsible
for other people's actions.</i>

515
00:31:03,423 --> 00:31:06,881
Detective, I know why
you sittin' here so patiently.

516
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,793
You waitin' for me to slip up
and say somethin'...

517
00:31:09,862 --> 00:31:12,228
<i>that's gonna wrap up your case
in a nice little package.</i>

518
00:31:12,298 --> 00:31:15,358
- Let me make it easy for you.
- Listen, why don't we put a pin in this?

519
00:31:15,435 --> 00:31:18,598
<i>- We don't need-Shh.
- I confess. I'm guilty.</i>

520
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:22,039
<i>- Say again.
- I'm guilty.</i>

521
00:31:22,108 --> 00:31:25,976
I'm guilty of being... naive.

522
00:31:29,882 --> 00:31:32,578
You tryin' to play us, Mrs. Mass...

523
00:31:32,652 --> 00:31:34,643
like you played your husband?

524
00:31:34,721 --> 00:31:36,851
<i>You do realize these are
unfounded allegations, Dwight?</i>

525
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:37,783
<i>You do realize these are
unfounded allegations, Dwight?</i>

526
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:39,786
Hold. Wait, wait.

527
00:31:39,854 --> 00:31:42,322
Why would a Georgia peach
like yourself...

528
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:45,018
leave your fingerprints on a gun?

529
00:32:17,425 --> 00:32:20,223
<i>Kevin convinced Dutch that...</i>

530
00:32:20,295 --> 00:32:23,093
<i>if he was gonna treat the rich...</i>

531
00:32:23,164 --> 00:32:25,155
<i>he needed to be one of 'em-</i>

532
00:32:25,233 --> 00:32:27,963
<i>adopt the lifestyle.</i>

533
00:32:28,036 --> 00:32:31,403
<i>When I look back on it now...</i>

534
00:32:31,473 --> 00:32:33,771
<i>either I-I couldn't see or...</i>

535
00:32:33,842 --> 00:32:35,969
Open your eyes. Huh?

536
00:32:36,044 --> 00:32:38,706
<i>- didn't want to.
- Oh, my God!</i>

537
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,714
- Is this ours?
- This is ours.

538
00:32:40,782 --> 00:32:43,273
<i>The cars we didn't need
and couldn't afford.</i>

539
00:32:43,351 --> 00:32:45,342
<i>The Louis Vuitton, the Gucci.</i>

540
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,480
<i>We had everything
a man and a woman could want.</i>

541
00:32:48,556 --> 00:32:51,116
She's got her room already.
Let's go see it. Come on, guys.

542
00:32:51,192 --> 00:32:53,786
Or so I thought.

543
00:32:53,862 --> 00:32:56,092
<i>Kevin, I owe all of this to you. Thanks.</i>

544
00:32:56,164 --> 00:32:59,031
Don't thank me yet, because,
uh, you know how payback can be.

545
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,034
Yeah.

546
00:33:01,102 --> 00:33:05,505
Oh, this house is so rare.
I'm proud of you.

547
00:33:05,573 --> 00:33:08,440
It is more than I ever expected,
and I am so happy.

548
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,171
What if I rephrase it?

549
00:33:11,746 --> 00:33:15,443
- Please tell me I'm not the only gay man here.
- I'm afraid so, baby.

550
00:33:15,517 --> 00:33:17,109
Hey, uh, how's she doin'?

551
00:33:17,185 --> 00:33:19,983
<i>It's time to go.</i>

552
00:33:20,054 --> 00:33:24,354
- It's time to go!
- The party is here.

553
00:33:24,425 --> 00:33:29,124
I know you meant to invite me. Is there a bathroom
up here? 'Cause my ladies need to go.

554
00:33:29,197 --> 00:33:32,325
<i>- Upstairs and down the hall.
- I think I'm gonna go with 'em.</i>

555
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,561
I like the view from here. Mmm!

556
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:40,166
- Excuse me. Can I just, uh, steal my wife?
- Oh, yeah. Excuse me.

557
00:33:40,241 --> 00:33:43,506
- Come on.
- What? What?

558
00:33:43,578 --> 00:33:45,773
Listen.

559
00:33:45,847 --> 00:33:48,816
Now, there's no way I can thank you
for your support over the years.

560
00:33:48,883 --> 00:33:50,544
- But, uh-
- What you got?

561
00:33:50,618 --> 00:33:53,143
- Here's a small token.
- What have you-

562
00:33:53,221 --> 00:33:55,985
Oh, man! Is that-

563
00:34:00,395 --> 00:34:01,760
Thank you.

564
00:34:01,829 --> 00:34:05,026
<i>Look at that man.</i>

565
00:34:07,302 --> 00:34:09,566
- What are you doin'?
- What's it look like I'm doin'?

566
00:34:09,637 --> 00:34:12,265
- My daughter's upstairs.
- Dutch, no, no, no. It's all right.

567
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,605
<i>- Dutch. Dutch, it's all right.
- No. This is my house.</i>

568
00:34:15,677 --> 00:34:18,168
I thought it was Kevin's house,
and I thought this was a party.

569
00:34:18,246 --> 00:34:20,771
You know- Okay,
I'd like for you to leave.

570
00:34:20,848 --> 00:34:24,841
- Kevin, ain't this your house?
- Is this necessary, Ryan?

571
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:26,944
I'm just tryin' to clear up
a discrepancy here. My bad.

572
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:31,117
Just get out.
Take your girlfriends and get out.

573
00:34:31,192 --> 00:34:33,285
- Come on. We gonna go to a real party.
- Yeah.

574
00:34:33,361 --> 00:34:37,127
A Ryan Chambers party.
Y'all wanna come to a fun party?

575
00:34:37,198 --> 00:34:39,189
Come to Ryan Chambers's party. Ha!

576
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:46,900
<i>If your significant other
isn't attending church...</i>

577
00:34:46,975 --> 00:34:50,103
this can be the beginning
of a serious rift in the relationship.

578
00:34:50,178 --> 00:34:52,146
Yes. Sister Mass.

579
00:34:52,213 --> 00:34:54,147
Uh.

580
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:58,112
What do you do, Sister Dunn...

581
00:34:58,186 --> 00:35:01,849
if your significant other says he wants
to be a part of the church-

582
00:35:01,923 --> 00:35:03,652
<i>Mmm.</i>

583
00:35:03,725 --> 00:35:05,750
but come Sunday...

584
00:35:05,827 --> 00:35:07,795
he always has some excuse not to go?

585
00:35:07,862 --> 00:35:12,231
...or an excuse. What if honesty wasn't
there from the beginning?

586
00:35:13,301 --> 00:35:15,428
What did you say, Charlotte?

587
00:35:15,503 --> 00:35:19,166
I was...
just agreeing with Val.

588
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,209
<i>- Well, amen.
- Amen.</i>

589
00:35:22,276 --> 00:35:24,767
- Hallelujah.
- Amen.

590
00:35:24,846 --> 00:35:27,815
<i>I see you wearin'
some new bling-bling, Mrs. Mass.</i>

591
00:35:27,882 --> 00:35:31,113
- It's a gift.
- Uh-huh.

592
00:35:37,759 --> 00:35:40,250
- Was she starin' at me?
- She sure was.

593
00:35:40,328 --> 00:35:42,319
That child
been comin' here for months...

594
00:35:42,397 --> 00:35:44,922
and hasn't said a word
until tonight.

595
00:35:44,999 --> 00:35:46,990
I think she got some issues.

596
00:35:52,006 --> 00:35:54,600
- Hey, Monica.
- Where the hell is Dutch, huh?

597
00:35:54,676 --> 00:35:56,610
- Du-
- Dutch!

598
00:35:56,678 --> 00:35:59,613
- Monica, Dutch is not here.
- Where the hell is Dutch
with my prescriptions, huh?

599
00:35:59,681 --> 00:36:01,615
- Monica, Dutch is not here.
- Dutch!

600
00:36:01,683 --> 00:36:03,617
And, girl,
what happened to your face?

601
00:36:04,886 --> 00:36:07,650
Have to hurt myself a little of today...

602
00:36:07,722 --> 00:36:09,815
if that's okay with you.

603
00:36:09,891 --> 00:36:13,520
- Dutch!
- Monica, Dutch is not here.

604
00:36:13,594 --> 00:36:17,758
Dutch! I bet you don't know
where he puts his prescriptions.

605
00:36:17,832 --> 00:36:22,326
I was in the hospital today, and Dutch
wasn't at the hospital today.

606
00:36:22,403 --> 00:36:25,031
- He's not here.
- So where is he?

607
00:36:25,106 --> 00:36:28,371
You obviously don't know where
the doctor keeps his prescription pad.

608
00:36:28,443 --> 00:36:30,377
- Please?
- I don't know.

609
00:36:30,445 --> 00:36:32,242
- Oh, no? You don't know?
- No.

610
00:36:33,981 --> 00:36:36,142
<i>Are you sure?</i>

611
00:36:36,217 --> 00:36:39,311
- What are you doin'?
- Oh, I'm high, and I'm drunk.

612
00:36:39,387 --> 00:36:43,221
- And I'm drunk, and I'm high.
- You need to give me that gun.

613
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:45,088
<i>I'm tired of giving.</i>

614
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:48,595
All I do is give, give.

615
00:36:48,663 --> 00:36:51,996
- Give me the gun. Give- Oh!
- I'm not strong like you.

616
00:36:52,066 --> 00:36:55,832
- Monica, please.
- You could do it.

617
00:36:57,171 --> 00:37:00,163
You could kill me.

618
00:37:00,241 --> 00:37:02,175
- No!
- My heart feels dead.

619
00:37:02,243 --> 00:37:06,111
- I wanna be dead!
- Oh!

620
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:10,674
- I got the gun, all right?
- Don't you understand me? Huh?

621
00:37:10,752 --> 00:37:13,619
<i>You're so naive!</i>

622
00:37:13,688 --> 00:37:16,350
I'm in love with a man...

623
00:37:16,424 --> 00:37:19,257
who sleeps around!

624
00:37:19,327 --> 00:37:22,125
<i>And he knows that I'll never leave.</i>

625
00:37:22,196 --> 00:37:26,929
- And God has forsaken me!
- Monica, you cannot blame God for your problems.

626
00:37:27,001 --> 00:37:29,026
<i>- You cannot blame him for your problems.
- I do.</i>

627
00:37:29,103 --> 00:37:31,537
I do blame God.

628
00:37:31,606 --> 00:37:34,803
And one day, you will blame God too.

629
00:37:34,876 --> 00:37:38,073
At least my husband
tells me the truth.

630
00:37:38,146 --> 00:37:40,410
<i>Your husband?
It's pathetic.</i>

631
00:37:40,481 --> 00:37:43,314
- What's pathetic?
- Your lie.

632
00:37:47,588 --> 00:37:51,490
It's so much more fulfilling
than my truth, and that's pathetic.

633
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:55,325
You wanna know where
Dutch is, don't you?

634
00:37:55,396 --> 00:37:57,921
Oh, I wonder.

635
00:37:57,999 --> 00:38:02,333
<i>Hmm. Where does Dutch wake up?</i>

636
00:38:04,472 --> 00:38:07,532
Oh, Val.
It's snowin' outside.

637
00:38:07,608 --> 00:38:12,272
Hmm. God has given us
another perfect day.

638
00:38:15,149 --> 00:38:17,811
So you're sayin' that that's how
your fingerprints got on the gun?

639
00:38:17,885 --> 00:38:20,683
<i>Val's prints are not
the only prints on the gun.</i>

640
00:38:20,755 --> 00:38:23,849
You should have found Monica's prints on
the gun too. It's all gonna come out in discovery.

641
00:38:23,925 --> 00:38:27,122
<i>Monica's prints were on the gun,
but she has an alibi.</i>

642
00:38:27,195 --> 00:38:29,925
<i>Now, your client,
on the other hand-</i>

643
00:38:29,997 --> 00:38:32,227
The question is not
how the fingerprints got on the gun...

644
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,495
but what you did with it.

645
00:38:34,569 --> 00:38:38,471
Well, up until this point, I had no proof
that my husband was being unfaithful.

646
00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:42,635
What? Come on. You've gotta
be the most naive woman on this planet.

647
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,439
- Naive?
- Yes.

648
00:38:44,512 --> 00:38:47,345
- I never said I was naive.
- You didn't?

649
00:38:47,415 --> 00:38:50,816
"I am guilty of being naive."

650
00:38:50,885 --> 00:38:53,319
<i>- Come on. Is this really-
- You keep out of this!</i>

651
00:38:53,387 --> 00:38:55,685
- What do you mean keep out?
- I didn't say naive.
- You just said you didn't.

652
00:38:55,756 --> 00:38:58,190
- I know I didn't say naive.
- How often do you say what you don't mean?

653
00:38:58,259 --> 00:39:00,159
- I didn't mean naive in the way-
- Tell me what you mean.

654
00:39:00,228 --> 00:39:02,162
I-I love my husband!

655
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,824
I had faith in my husband!

656
00:39:04,899 --> 00:39:07,834
And... I had a lot to lose.

657
00:39:10,571 --> 00:39:13,233
Ooh. That's a nicer piece than mine.

658
00:39:13,307 --> 00:39:15,468
<i>I don't want that thing in my house.</i>

659
00:39:15,543 --> 00:39:18,569
<i>What am I supposed to do with that?</i>

660
00:39:18,646 --> 00:39:20,739
Well, I don't need it.

661
00:39:20,815 --> 00:39:22,510
I already got one.

662
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:25,313
Zahara, if you don't
put that thing away-

663
00:39:25,386 --> 00:39:27,877
- You got a permit for that?
- Mm-hmm.

664
00:39:27,955 --> 00:39:30,116
It's better than mace.

665
00:39:30,191 --> 00:39:33,024
You should hold on to this.
Around here, you never know.

666
00:39:33,094 --> 00:39:36,860
- Just in case.
- Okay, all right. Okay, just stop.

667
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,894
Monica came over to my house,
and-and, yes, she was trippin'.

668
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:44,938
Yes, she was high.
But, Zahara...

669
00:39:45,006 --> 00:39:46,871
some of that stuff
that girl said to me-

670
00:39:48,509 --> 00:39:52,707
- I don't know. It got to me.
- Pull over, Val.

671
00:40:12,934 --> 00:40:15,562
You been takin' pictures
of Dutch all this time?

672
00:40:15,636 --> 00:40:18,628
Baby, I know how painful this is...

673
00:40:18,706 --> 00:40:21,607
<i>but it's time you knew the truth.</i>

674
00:40:21,676 --> 00:40:25,237
For the sake of-

675
00:40:25,313 --> 00:40:27,247
Thanks, Doc.

676
00:40:27,315 --> 00:40:28,976
- I'll see you next week.
- Thank you.

677
00:40:33,721 --> 00:40:35,655
Baby, wh-

678
00:40:35,723 --> 00:40:38,783
What are you doin' here?
What's wrong?

679
00:40:40,194 --> 00:40:44,722
Surprise.
So, you at the office, huh?

680
00:40:44,799 --> 00:40:50,101
- I'm always at the office.
- Not always. Mm-mmm.

681
00:40:50,171 --> 00:40:53,470
Saturday, you said
you had an appointment.

682
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:56,738
Here you are
walkin' out of a restaurant.

683
00:40:59,347 --> 00:41:03,078
I had a business lunch with Kevin,
goin' over some clinic finances.

684
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,084
Why don't you just ask me?

685
00:41:05,152 --> 00:41:07,086
There's a logical explanation for-

686
00:41:07,154 --> 00:41:10,681
And why are you talking on a pay phone
when you got two cell phones...

687
00:41:10,758 --> 00:41:14,285
<i>except but to keep it
off your call log?</i>

688
00:41:14,362 --> 00:41:16,353
- My battery was dead.
- Both of them?

689
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,863
<i>- You wanna check my call log?
- I should.</i>

690
00:41:17,932 --> 00:41:21,993
<i>- Monday, you were workin' out with the guys?
- Yeah.</i>

691
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:24,003
Here you are comin' out of a hotel.

692
00:41:24,071 --> 00:41:26,437
<i>And these pictures here
with Monica-</i>

693
00:41:26,507 --> 00:41:30,841
<i>Do you hug and kiss
on all your patients?</i>

694
00:41:30,911 --> 00:41:33,402
<i>I was consoling her.
It wasn't anything like that.</i>

695
00:41:33,481 --> 00:41:36,006
It wasn't anything like that?
Dutch, come on.

696
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:39,678
<i>You think I'm stupid?</i>

697
00:41:43,924 --> 00:41:46,620
Answer it. Answer it.

698
00:41:46,694 --> 00:41:49,857
<i>Val, you're paranoid, you know.</i>

699
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:52,330
<i>- Why don't you take a Valium?
- Don't play psychiatrist with me.</i>

700
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,164
Who's callin' you?

701
00:41:55,236 --> 00:41:57,500
- It's probably a patient.
- Okay.

702
00:41:58,706 --> 00:42:01,402
- Let me see the caller I.D.
- Come on, Val.

703
00:42:01,475 --> 00:42:04,535
You sleepin' on the couch.

704
00:42:04,612 --> 00:42:07,172
In my house-
the house I'm payin' for?

705
00:42:07,248 --> 00:42:09,580
You don't wanna sleep on the couch?

706
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:11,777
<i>I'm gonna take Nicole,
and we gonna move back to Atlanta.</i>

707
00:42:11,852 --> 00:42:14,082
I guess I'm sleepin' on the couch then.
You happy now?

708
00:42:14,155 --> 00:42:16,282
Am I happy?

709
00:42:20,127 --> 00:42:22,721
<i>Val.</i>

710
00:42:24,532 --> 00:42:26,466
<i>Thirty-first floor.</i>

711
00:42:39,113 --> 00:42:41,411
<i>Look, you runnin' out of time.</i>

712
00:42:41,482 --> 00:42:43,882
Detective Hicks is being
really patient with you.

713
00:42:43,951 --> 00:42:47,148
<i>But a black woman on death row
doesn't really bother me...</i>

714
00:42:47,221 --> 00:42:50,213
not when I have your fingerprints
all over the murder weapon.

715
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:52,384
Yes, my fingerprints are
all over that murder weapon...

716
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,793
but I have not seen that gun
in a long time.

717
00:42:55,863 --> 00:42:59,060
<i>Oh, come on, Dwight.
What are you doing here?</i>

718
00:42:59,133 --> 00:43:02,125
Mrs. Mass,
I am not a patient person.

719
00:43:06,173 --> 00:43:08,641
<i>- Jenny? Well, I'll have another triple.
- Okay.</i>

720
00:43:08,709 --> 00:43:11,473
- My son here-
- Hennessy and water. Two.

721
00:43:11,545 --> 00:43:14,378
<i>Jen, what's a pretty girl like you...</i>

722
00:43:14,448 --> 00:43:17,144
<i>doin' workin' in a joint like this
on a Saturday night?</i>

723
00:43:17,218 --> 00:43:20,551
Don't you have a better offer?
Now, I can offer you a whole range of-

724
00:43:20,621 --> 00:43:23,715
No, Mr. Mass.
I think I already heard that offer.

725
00:43:23,791 --> 00:43:26,817
<i>Sorry, Jenny. You know, he old.</i>

726
00:43:26,894 --> 00:43:29,556
- Just-
- Son.

727
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:31,689
Now...

728
00:43:31,765 --> 00:43:35,599
all marriages have rocky times.

729
00:43:35,669 --> 00:43:37,694
I mean, you can know more
about what women think...

730
00:43:37,771 --> 00:43:40,501
than they know about themselves.

731
00:43:40,574 --> 00:43:42,269
That can lead to "provocatation."

732
00:43:42,343 --> 00:43:44,277
But you're just like your old man.
You're a Mass man.

733
00:43:44,345 --> 00:43:46,575
The last of the Mass men.

734
00:43:46,647 --> 00:43:49,081
And God saved the best for last.

735
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:51,311
- I don't know about that.
- Yes, yes.

736
00:43:51,385 --> 00:43:53,649
Look at your accomplishments.

737
00:43:53,721 --> 00:43:55,746
You know how proud I am of you?

738
00:43:55,823 --> 00:43:58,656
- Listen. Dad, listen-
- Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!

739
00:43:58,726 --> 00:44:01,593
- Now, I brag-
- Dad, listen to me. Listen to me.

740
00:44:01,662 --> 00:44:04,130
- Now-Now, I want you to listen to-
- Dad, listen to me.

741
00:44:04,198 --> 00:44:06,996
- I brag to my buddies about you.
- There's something I wanna talk to you about.

742
00:44:07,067 --> 00:44:09,968
- Listen to me. I wanna talk to you about
something. - I brag to them all the time.

743
00:44:10,037 --> 00:44:11,834
Who else got a kid who's an M. D?

744
00:44:11,906 --> 00:44:14,841
This-This is my son here!

745
00:44:14,909 --> 00:44:17,343
- This one! Here he is!
- That's right.

746
00:44:17,411 --> 00:44:19,709
- Here he is! All right.
- Sit down, Dad.

747
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,975
- Let me- Let me talk to ya.
- Come on.

748
00:44:22,049 --> 00:44:23,983
You been places I could only see.

749
00:44:24,051 --> 00:44:27,350
I want you to look at what
you've done for your family.

750
00:44:27,421 --> 00:44:29,480
They are never gonna be in need.

751
00:44:29,557 --> 00:44:32,321
Look at the example
you are settin' for your daughter.

752
00:44:32,393 --> 00:44:35,829
I am proud of the man you've become.

753
00:44:35,896 --> 00:44:37,659
<i>Jenny.</i>

754
00:44:37,731 --> 00:44:40,495
- Is it something I said?
- No.

755
00:44:40,568 --> 00:44:43,628
- If I say it to you differently, will you listen to me?
- No.

756
00:44:43,704 --> 00:44:47,970
How about if I sing to you, baby?
Now that is a hard, cold woman.

757
00:44:48,042 --> 00:44:51,637
But I'm not gonna give up.
Mass man.

758
00:44:51,712 --> 00:44:54,112
<i>What is it you want to ask me, Son?</i>

759
00:44:55,449 --> 00:44:59,180
<i>What is it? Come on now.
Come on out with it.</i>

760
00:44:59,253 --> 00:45:03,690
All right. Well, um-

761
00:45:07,428 --> 00:45:10,022
Man, it's nothin'.
Just anxiety, you know?

762
00:45:10,097 --> 00:45:13,066
Just Val and me
not gettin' on and-

763
00:45:13,133 --> 00:45:15,067
It-It's nothin'.
It's nothin'.

764
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:18,696
Two young people in love, rich.

765
00:45:18,772 --> 00:45:22,264
It's all gonna work out, Son.
Right here. Mm-hmm.

766
00:45:23,577 --> 00:45:26,671
- I love you, Son.
- I love you, Pops.

767
00:45:28,048 --> 00:45:30,846
Come- Hey, come on, man.
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

768
00:45:34,822 --> 00:45:37,518
<i>- Mr. Chambers will be down momentarily.
- Okay.</i>

769
00:45:37,591 --> 00:45:40,219
Girl, why is my first photo shoot
with Ryan Chambers?

770
00:45:40,294 --> 00:45:42,285
'Cause this is gonna look
great on your rsum.

771
00:45:42,363 --> 00:45:46,094
<i>- Trust me. This is good for you.
- Good for me too.</i>

772
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:49,397
# Hey, ladies #

773
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:52,268
#What we gonna do about it #

774
00:45:52,339 --> 00:45:55,308
<i># Please tell me again #</i>

775
00:45:55,376 --> 00:45:57,537
<i># Our friendship #</i>

776
00:45:57,611 --> 00:45:59,943
<i># Man and woman #</i>

777
00:46:00,014 --> 00:46:03,040
# Somethin' not right about it ##

778
00:46:03,117 --> 00:46:06,086
Don't be intimidated.
I know it's your first time shootin' a star.

779
00:46:06,153 --> 00:46:08,747
I won't bite you-
unless you request it.

780
00:46:08,822 --> 00:46:11,222
Ryan.

781
00:46:11,292 --> 00:46:14,784
I have got another appointment, so-
I have got to go.

782
00:46:14,862 --> 00:46:17,228
- Mmm. Too bad.
- Ready?

783
00:46:17,298 --> 00:46:19,163
Do I look ready?

784
00:46:19,233 --> 00:46:21,394
You always look ready,
my brother.

785
00:46:21,468 --> 00:46:23,402
Nice suit.

786
00:46:25,873 --> 00:46:29,400
So, this how you want me?

787
00:46:42,589 --> 00:46:44,648
Look up. Let me see your eyes.

788
00:46:44,725 --> 00:46:46,317
<i># They don't like my money #</i>

789
00:46:46,393 --> 00:46:50,090
Open your jacket
a little bit so I can see.

790
00:46:50,164 --> 00:46:53,292
Now loosen up the tie.
Loosen up the tie a little.

791
00:46:55,269 --> 00:46:58,136
Yeah.

792
00:46:58,205 --> 00:47:00,196
Turn around a little.
Now give it to me from-

793
00:47:00,274 --> 00:47:02,367
There you go.
It was beautiful.

794
00:47:03,677 --> 00:47:06,733
Open your eyes.
Give me some of the eye-

795
00:47:06,867 --> 00:47:09,427
Okay, Ryan, give me, uh-
Give me a profile.

796
00:47:12,873 --> 00:47:14,966
<i>Thank you. I think we got it.</i>

797
00:47:15,042 --> 00:47:18,808
- That was great. Thank you so much, Ryan.
- But I'm not finished yet.

798
00:47:18,879 --> 00:47:21,643
I think we got some good shots.
You should be happy.

799
00:47:21,715 --> 00:47:24,013
<i>No. I got somethin' else in mind.
You just keep shootin'.</i>

800
00:47:24,084 --> 00:47:27,451
<i>For real. We got
some really good shots.</i>

801
00:47:27,521 --> 00:47:30,581
I'm thinking about using this
for my album cover. You just keep shootin'.

802
00:47:30,657 --> 00:47:33,353
All right, but it's your time
and your money.

803
00:47:37,731 --> 00:47:40,165
What are you doin'?

804
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:43,168
Mmm.

805
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:46,137
How's it look on me?

806
00:47:46,206 --> 00:47:48,731
Yo. Give that back to me, please.

807
00:47:48,809 --> 00:47:52,301
Just let me read your palm.
I'm really good at this.

808
00:47:52,379 --> 00:47:55,371
I think a life-altering experience
about to happen in about 15-

809
00:47:55,449 --> 00:47:58,816
<i>- What are you do- Stop. Get your hands off me!
- What are you doin'?</i>

810
00:47:58,885 --> 00:48:01,979
- What's up, dog?
- Dutch, what are you doing here?

811
00:48:02,055 --> 00:48:04,990
<i>- What are you doin' here?
- I'm doin' a job. It's a photo shoot.</i>

812
00:48:05,058 --> 00:48:07,549
- Just stay away from my wife! That's my wife!
- Dutch!

813
00:48:07,627 --> 00:48:09,925
- It's all good, dog!
- You stay away from my wife! You hear me!

814
00:48:09,996 --> 00:48:11,987
- Stay away from my wife!
- Dutch! Let's go.

815
00:48:12,065 --> 00:48:14,795
Get your hands off me!
What is this, payback? Huh?

816
00:48:14,868 --> 00:48:16,733
Payback? Ain't nothin'
goin' on between me-

817
00:48:16,803 --> 00:48:19,203
He's standin' over there
half naked with a smile.

818
00:48:19,272 --> 00:48:20,830
<i>- Don't tell me you ain't tryin' to do nothin'!
- It's a job!</i>

819
00:48:20,907 --> 00:48:23,501
- I ain't tryin' to get with that man!
- This is your job?

820
00:48:23,577 --> 00:48:26,137
<i>- On my job!
- You are a wife, and you are a mother!</i>

821
00:48:26,213 --> 00:48:28,340
Oh, I'm your wife?
You rememberin' that now, huh?

822
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:30,906
That's what this is about-
Monica. Let me tell you something.

823
00:48:30,984 --> 00:48:33,748
- Monica was just a friend.
- Hello? What about your equipment?

824
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,345
I don't give a damn about that equipment.
Zahara will get it next week.

825
00:48:36,423 --> 00:48:38,857
This ain't over.

826
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,091
You sayin' that's how
the earrings got in the room.

827
00:48:42,162 --> 00:48:44,255
Who leaves earrings
when they commit a murder?

828
00:48:44,331 --> 00:48:46,891
<i>Maybe murder wasn't
option number one.</i>

829
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:51,529
Juries want cases that make sense-
in case you haven't noticed- and so do voters.

830
00:48:51,605 --> 00:48:55,905
<i>I don't know if this is the case that's going
to sweep you into office by a landslide.</i>

831
00:48:55,976 --> 00:49:00,037
<i>- You haven't convinced me.
Has he convinced you, Mrs. Mass?
- Felons can't vote.</i>

832
00:49:00,113 --> 00:49:03,480
<i>Supposition on top of assumption
on top of pure nonsense...</i>

833
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:06,178
which makes it clear to me-
and will make it very clear to a jury-

834
00:49:06,253 --> 00:49:08,187
<i>that, Dwight, you have got nothing.</i>

835
00:49:08,255 --> 00:49:11,190
And you've got 15 minutes
to wrap this up...

836
00:49:11,258 --> 00:49:14,022
<i>and then I'm goin' out there
and I'm telling the press...</i>

837
00:49:14,094 --> 00:49:17,257
<i>that we have charged
our prime suspect with murder-</i>

838
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:20,424
<i>with or without a confession.</i>

839
00:49:21,535 --> 00:49:23,230
Fifteen minutes.

840
00:49:23,503 --> 00:49:26,267
<i>What do you think would
have happened if Dutch hadn't walked in?</i>

841
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:28,534
This woman is always staring at me.

842
00:49:28,608 --> 00:49:31,441
- She gives me the heebie-jeebies.
- Issues. Issues.

843
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:34,639
- Valerie.
- Hey, Charlotte. How you doin'?

844
00:49:34,714 --> 00:49:37,114
I know somethin' about your husband.

845
00:49:37,184 --> 00:49:40,244
- And what is that exactly?
- Something you should know.

846
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,312
What are you talkin' about,
Charlotte?

847
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:46,154
- Loews Hotel. Go there now.
- What is this?

848
00:49:46,226 --> 00:49:48,319
Room 3118.
Please be careful.

849
00:49:48,395 --> 00:49:52,661
<i>It could be very dangerous. You are dealing
with someone who can be very irrational.</i>

850
00:49:52,732 --> 00:49:55,064
Wait a second. Dutch?

851
00:49:55,135 --> 00:49:57,968
Charlotte, how well
do you know my husband?

852
00:49:58,038 --> 00:50:00,302
I'm not talking about your husband.

853
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:03,604
I'm sorry. I just think
you need to know.

854
00:50:03,677 --> 00:50:06,339
- What in God's name?
- Charlotte!

855
00:50:06,413 --> 00:50:09,109
<i>- Val!
- Charlotte!</i>

856
00:50:09,182 --> 00:50:12,777
Let her go! You don't know what you're
walking into. You heard what she said.

857
00:50:12,853 --> 00:50:16,983
Val, you're not listening
to me! Val.

858
00:50:17,057 --> 00:50:21,118
Listen to me. I know
what I'm talking about.

859
00:50:21,194 --> 00:50:26,291
Look. I got this scar when I walked in on
my husband when he was with another woman.

860
00:50:26,366 --> 00:50:29,494
It got ugly. Real ugly.
You don't know.

861
00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:32,094
He could be up there
with some crazy hooker.

862
00:50:32,172 --> 00:50:35,369
Zahara, please get out of my car.

863
00:50:35,442 --> 00:50:39,538
This is between me and my husband,
and I'm gonna deal with it myself.

864
00:50:39,613 --> 00:50:43,174
If you're not gonna let me go with you,
then you are taking this.

865
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,946
You gotta protect yourself, Val.
This ain't heaven, baby.

866
00:50:46,019 --> 00:50:49,785
There are crazy people out there.
You are putting this in your bag...

867
00:50:49,856 --> 00:50:51,847
- or I am coming with you.
- No!

868
00:50:51,925 --> 00:50:55,656
Take it!
Or I'm going with you.

869
00:50:55,729 --> 00:50:58,129
Thank you.

870
00:50:58,198 --> 00:51:01,190
Anything happens, call me, you hear?

871
00:51:01,268 --> 00:51:03,964
<i>- Fine, sure.
- All right.</i>

872
00:51:04,037 --> 00:51:06,062
<i>Get yourself together, all right?</i>

873
00:51:06,139 --> 00:51:08,972
<i>It's gonna be all right.</i>

874
00:51:09,042 --> 00:51:10,634
You okay?

875
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:32,857
- Hi.
- How can I help you?

876
00:51:32,933 --> 00:51:37,393
Do you have a Dutch Mass
registered here?

877
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:39,597
- Dutch Mass? Let me check.
- Yes.

878
00:51:43,076 --> 00:51:45,169
No, I don't see that name.

879
00:51:45,245 --> 00:51:47,236
Thank you.

880
00:51:48,615 --> 00:51:52,210
Oh, wait. I do have a Dr. Dutch Mass.

881
00:51:52,285 --> 00:51:55,413
Would you like me to ring
his room for you?

882
00:51:56,890 --> 00:52:00,417
No, thank you.
No, thank you.

883
00:52:03,263 --> 00:52:05,754
<i>Thirty-first floor.</i>

884
00:52:18,311 --> 00:52:20,973
May I help you?

885
00:52:21,047 --> 00:52:24,448
- Room 3118?
- Yeah.

886
00:52:24,517 --> 00:52:27,042
End of the hall.

887
00:53:51,871 --> 00:53:54,101
<i>I missed you.</i>

888
00:53:54,174 --> 00:53:56,972
<i>I missed you.</i>

889
00:54:00,847 --> 00:54:03,372
<i>Right there. Oh, yeah.</i>

890
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:05,680
<i>I missed you a lot.</i>

891
00:54:09,889 --> 00:54:13,347
Mmm. Right there.

892
00:54:14,661 --> 00:54:18,597
- You've been working out, huh?
- Yeah.

893
00:54:18,665 --> 00:54:23,568
You've been workin' out.
I can feel it.

894
00:54:34,814 --> 00:54:38,215
Val.

895
00:54:39,185 --> 00:54:41,380
I'm sorry.

896
00:54:43,089 --> 00:54:45,216
<i>Okay.</i>

897
00:54:45,291 --> 00:54:47,725
<i>Val. Val.</i>

898
00:54:47,794 --> 00:54:50,422
<i>I'm sorry.
Baby, I'm sorry.</i>

899
00:54:50,497 --> 00:54:52,931
<i>I'm sorry. Val.</i>

900
00:54:54,134 --> 00:54:56,295
<i>Val, I can explain.</i>

901
00:54:57,337 --> 00:54:59,362
<i>God, Val!</i>

902
00:54:59,439 --> 00:55:01,236
<i>Val, I can explain.</i>

903
00:55:01,307 --> 00:55:03,537
<i>Val! Yo, I'm sorry.</i>

904
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:08,279
Val, wait.
Val, you gotta give me a chance!

905
00:55:08,348 --> 00:55:11,715
<i>Give me a chance!</i>

906
00:55:11,785 --> 00:55:15,050
Give me a chance to explain!
Val, wait. I'm sorry!

907
00:55:15,121 --> 00:55:18,716
No, no, no. Wait, wait!
No. Wait. Please!

908
00:55:18,792 --> 00:55:20,953
<i>Wait!</i>

909
00:55:21,027 --> 00:55:23,427
- Val.
- This door's closed.

910
00:55:23,496 --> 00:55:26,431
- No! Oh.
- Listen.

911
00:55:26,499 --> 00:55:29,900
Val, listen to me.
Val, it's not what you think.

912
00:55:29,969 --> 00:55:33,405
Val, listen to me. Come on. Come on, Val.

913
00:55:33,473 --> 00:55:35,964
<i>Baby! Stop it.
Come on, Val. Stop.</i>

914
00:55:36,042 --> 00:55:38,738
- Oh! No!
- Listen to me.

915
00:55:38,812 --> 00:55:41,610
- No!
- Come back.

916
00:55:41,681 --> 00:55:44,514
Do we have a problem here?
Ma'am? Sir, sir.

917
00:55:44,584 --> 00:55:47,644
<i>- You need to let her go. Calm down, sir.
- Don't make me call the police.</i>

918
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,621
Hey, Val. Hey, Val!
Hey, that's my wife!

919
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:54,091
Take your hands off me!

920
00:56:06,873 --> 00:56:09,671
How was the church meeting,
Ms. Mass?

921
00:56:11,177 --> 00:56:14,635
Are you okay? Ms. Mass.

922
00:56:34,067 --> 00:56:36,331
<i>Mrs. Mass,
is there anything I can do?</i>

923
00:56:36,402 --> 00:56:38,529
Ms. Mass,
is there anything I can do?

924
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,170
<i>- Ms. Mass!
- No!</i>

925
00:57:04,797 --> 00:57:08,528
No!

926
00:57:08,635 --> 00:57:10,865
<i>Explain to me...</i>

927
00:57:10,937 --> 00:57:15,601
how you went into that hotel room
with a loaded gun...

928
00:57:15,675 --> 00:57:19,736
and you saw your husband
in that situation and nothing happened.

929
00:57:23,449 --> 00:57:25,440
Nothin' happened?

930
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:28,710
Nothin' happened?

931
00:57:30,423 --> 00:57:32,414
Detective Hicks...

932
00:57:33,426 --> 00:57:35,826
the end of my life happened.

933
00:57:37,463 --> 00:57:41,229
Everything I believed in... died.

934
00:57:43,536 --> 00:57:46,471
My future, my family...

935
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,404
my faith, my hope...

936
00:57:52,245 --> 00:57:54,304
died in that moment.

937
00:57:56,883 --> 00:58:00,944
You can sit over there
and say to me...

938
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,011
nothin' happened?

939
00:58:13,266 --> 00:58:16,292
And that was the last time
you saw that gun?

940
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:18,803
<i>Yes.</i>

941
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:21,465
Come in.

942
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:25,671
We're running out of time.
Meet me in the foyer.

943
00:58:25,745 --> 00:58:28,407
- Five minutes.
- Ah, got it.

944
00:58:36,522 --> 00:58:40,856
<i>When was the next time you saw
your husband or Ryan after the hotel?</i>

945
00:59:01,781 --> 00:59:03,715
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

946
00:59:09,088 --> 00:59:11,716
What are you doing here?

947
00:59:19,098 --> 00:59:21,328
I got a question for you.

948
00:59:23,436 --> 00:59:25,734
And I want you
to answer it honestly.

949
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:44,083
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, baby.

950
00:59:44,157 --> 00:59:46,455
Did you use protection?

951
00:59:48,094 --> 00:59:50,085
Mm-hmm.

952
00:59:52,832 --> 00:59:54,766
Always?

953
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:02,230
Always?

954
01:00:09,449 --> 01:00:11,440
No.

955
01:00:22,795 --> 01:00:24,695
<i>Val!</i>

956
01:00:24,764 --> 01:00:27,198
Wait, wait. I'm sorry.

957
01:00:27,266 --> 01:00:30,633
Val! Val!

958
01:00:30,703 --> 01:00:33,103
Please!

959
01:00:33,172 --> 01:00:35,766
Daddy! Stop!
Make it stop!

960
01:00:35,842 --> 01:00:39,300
<i>- I'm sorry!
- Mommy, stop! Don't! Please.</i>

961
01:00:39,378 --> 01:00:42,404
- Stop!
- Get out!

962
01:00:42,482 --> 01:00:45,417
- Go to your room, sweetheart.
- Get out! Get out!

963
01:00:45,485 --> 01:00:48,477
- Come on, Nicole. Come on, Nicole!
- Daddy! Daddy!

964
01:00:48,554 --> 01:00:51,318
<i>Go to your room!</i>

965
01:00:56,295 --> 01:00:59,389
<i>Val, open up.</i>

966
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,200
Val, you okay?

967
01:01:07,907 --> 01:01:11,070
Now what is going on?
When did you start drinking?

968
01:01:11,144 --> 01:01:13,772
Who's taking care of Nicole?

969
01:01:13,846 --> 01:01:17,942
The babysitter took her to the mall
so I could have some peace.

970
01:01:18,017 --> 01:01:20,747
Val, you have got to stop trying
to hurt yourself.

971
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:23,983
Please, please, y'all,
leave me alone.

972
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:25,990
- What, alone with your booze?
- Yes.

973
01:01:26,058 --> 01:01:28,253
- See, you done lost your mind.
- Hmm.

974
01:01:28,327 --> 01:01:31,626
Girl, we gonna be in your face
till you come out of this room.

975
01:01:31,697 --> 01:01:33,961
You have got a daughter
to raise and a life to live.

976
01:01:34,033 --> 01:01:36,501
- I know.
- This is not your fault.

977
01:01:36,569 --> 01:01:38,867
I just can't take
any more right now.

978
01:01:38,938 --> 01:01:41,168
<i>- Okay?
- Okay.</i>

979
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:44,368
Mrs. Mass, you're gonna
make me get violent.

980
01:01:44,443 --> 01:01:47,776
That means I'm just gonna have to rip
that weave right out your heads.

981
01:01:47,847 --> 01:01:49,815
I don't wear a weave.

982
01:01:49,882 --> 01:01:53,682
Oh, you gonna need one
after I'm done with you, okay?

983
01:01:53,753 --> 01:01:55,778
Okay?

984
01:01:55,855 --> 01:02:00,815
Hey. Put your coat on.
Let's get something to eat, all right?

985
01:02:03,095 --> 01:02:06,064
I'm telling you,
I never saw Ryan that way.

986
01:02:06,132 --> 01:02:07,963
And usually my gay-dar is on point.

987
01:02:08,034 --> 01:02:11,003
I have always suspected
Ryan "the Secret" Chambers.

988
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:13,504
Why didn't Dutch just
say he was bisexual?

989
01:02:13,573 --> 01:02:18,169
Because he's not necessarily bisexual
or gay, at least not if you ask him.

990
01:02:18,244 --> 01:02:20,542
<i>He's just D.L.- down low.</i>

991
01:02:20,613 --> 01:02:23,446
How long would you have stayed
with Dutch if you knew...

992
01:02:23,516 --> 01:02:26,212
he had a thing for men?

993
01:02:26,285 --> 01:02:28,651
One date, half a date.

994
01:02:28,721 --> 01:02:31,315
How you think straight black men
would react to him if he came out?

995
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:33,984
What about his practice?
This is not an easy thing.

996
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:37,029
You shouldn't feel like you're
the only woman who ever went through this.

997
01:02:37,096 --> 01:02:39,929
- It's not that uncommon.
- Oh, I know that's right.

998
01:02:39,999 --> 01:02:43,162
Hmm. There are a whole lot
of boys who like it both ways.

999
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:47,989
Now check out the daddy with
the wife and two kids. Mm-hmm.

1000
01:02:51,335 --> 01:02:53,667
- Be right back.
- You kids ready to order?

1001
01:02:53,738 --> 01:02:56,730
- His wife is right there.
- Right there!

1002
01:02:59,944 --> 01:03:02,708
Yo, man, that dust in here is crazy.

1003
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:06,341
- Oh, really?
- As a matter of fact, I think
you have something in your eye.

1004
01:03:06,417 --> 01:03:10,353
- Oh, really.
- Yeah, you should let me blow it out for you.

1005
01:03:10,421 --> 01:03:12,446
Hey, Dad.

1006
01:03:12,523 --> 01:03:16,425
Oh, hey, Son. Why don't you
come up here and wash your hands?

1007
01:03:23,634 --> 01:03:26,626
- You did not.
- He ain't my type.

1008
01:03:26,704 --> 01:03:30,265
- You guys, I'm sorry, but-
- Val.

1009
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:45,620
They're upstairs.

1010
01:03:50,661 --> 01:03:53,994
Hello, Reverend Dunn, Sister Dunn.

1011
01:03:54,064 --> 01:03:56,123
What y'all doing here?

1012
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,395
<i>Just thought we'd put a few things in order.</i>

1013
01:03:58,469 --> 01:04:02,405
No huggin'. No preachin'.

1014
01:04:02,473 --> 01:04:04,703
Someone told me a story
once about a blind girl...

1015
01:04:04,775 --> 01:04:08,905
who hated herself just
because she was blind.

1016
01:04:08,979 --> 01:04:12,642
She hated everyone,
except her loving boyfriend.

1017
01:04:12,716 --> 01:04:17,153
He was always there for her. She said
that if she could only see the world...

1018
01:04:17,221 --> 01:04:19,121
she would marry her boyfriend.

1019
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:22,785
One day, someone donated
a pair of eyes to her.

1020
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:26,125
Then she could see everything,
including her boyfriend.

1021
01:04:26,197 --> 01:04:28,859
<i>He asked her,
"Now that you can see the world...</i>

1022
01:04:28,933 --> 01:04:31,094
will you marry me?"

1023
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:34,535
The girl was shocked when
she saw that he was blind, too...

1024
01:04:34,605 --> 01:04:37,802
and refused to marry him.

1025
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:40,810
Her boyfriend walked away in tears.

1026
01:04:40,878 --> 01:04:44,575
And later wrote a letter
to her saying...

1027
01:04:44,648 --> 01:04:47,048
"Just take care of my eyes, dear."

1028
01:04:47,117 --> 01:04:49,585
Hmph.

1029
01:04:49,653 --> 01:04:52,520
Who am I supposed to be,
the blind girl?

1030
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:56,686
- You were the blind girl.
- Can a blind girl get a drink?

1031
01:05:01,098 --> 01:05:04,966
Don't preach at me.
I already been saved.

1032
01:05:05,035 --> 01:05:09,665
I am a saved woman.
I have prayed and I have prayed.

1033
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:13,574
You see these scars on my knees?
That's from praying.

1034
01:05:13,644 --> 01:05:17,307
Valerie, once you start feeling sorry
for yourself, you give away your power.

1035
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:20,248
What power?
God ain't listening to me.

1036
01:05:20,317 --> 01:05:23,081
Stop giving Satan the glory.

1037
01:05:23,153 --> 01:05:25,849
I have been everything
God asked me to be.

1038
01:05:25,923 --> 01:05:29,518
I have been a good wife.
I have been a good mother.

1039
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:32,790
Every Sunday I make sure
I'm in somebody's church.

1040
01:05:32,863 --> 01:05:35,491
And I take my family with me.

1041
01:05:35,566 --> 01:05:37,466
<i>I saved myself for my husband.</i>

1042
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:40,231
<i>I saved my body for my husband.
And I have never...</i>

1043
01:05:40,304 --> 01:05:42,238
ever, ever thought
about cheating on him.

1044
01:05:42,306 --> 01:05:47,005
And I did these things not only because
I loved Dutch, but because I loved God.

1045
01:05:47,077 --> 01:05:50,205
You think you're the first woman
who's ever been betrayed by her husband?

1046
01:05:50,281 --> 01:05:53,250
I wasn't just betrayed
by my husband.

1047
01:05:53,317 --> 01:05:55,615
I was betrayed by God.

1048
01:05:55,686 --> 01:05:59,747
God didn't betray you, baby.
As Christians, we all have our cross to bear.

1049
01:05:59,823 --> 01:06:03,418
Jesus is bearing the cross.
You gonna make him bear it alone?

1050
01:06:03,494 --> 01:06:05,485
It was a man.

1051
01:06:06,664 --> 01:06:08,689
It was a man!

1052
01:06:08,766 --> 01:06:10,859
It would be one thing
if it was a woman.

1053
01:06:10,935 --> 01:06:13,768
I could do something about that!
I could compete with that.

1054
01:06:13,837 --> 01:06:17,534
Fix myself up, look cute in his eyes,
make myself beautiful for him.

1055
01:06:17,608 --> 01:06:20,543
But it's a man he wants!
A man!

1056
01:06:21,612 --> 01:06:23,773
In the name of Jesus Christ,
Valerie.

1057
01:06:23,847 --> 01:06:29,251
Women who struggled through
heartbreak, pain, slavery-

1058
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:32,153
And they did not do so
to see it come to this.

1059
01:06:32,222 --> 01:06:34,156
Rise up, Valerie.

1060
01:06:34,224 --> 01:06:36,317
Because someone is watching you.

1061
01:06:36,393 --> 01:06:38,384
And that somebody is your daughter.

1062
01:06:38,462 --> 01:06:41,625
And it's not the betrayal
that's important, Valerie.

1063
01:06:41,699 --> 01:06:43,758
It's the lesson you learn from it.

1064
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:45,893
- I can't.
- Yes, you can, Valerie.

1065
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:48,996
- Please, leave me alone. Please!
- Get up, Valerie.

1066
01:06:49,073 --> 01:06:51,166
Give God the glory.
Get up!

1067
01:06:51,241 --> 01:06:53,300
Take back your power.

1068
01:06:53,377 --> 01:06:55,641
<i>Mommy, are you okay?</i>

1069
01:06:58,749 --> 01:07:01,980
God loves you.

1070
01:07:05,089 --> 01:07:07,614
Yes, baby, Mommy's okay.

1071
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:10,660
Remember what you told me
to do every day?

1072
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:20,259
Come on, Mommy.

1073
01:07:23,674 --> 01:07:26,666
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

1074
01:07:26,744 --> 01:07:29,679
He maketh me to lay down
in green pastures...

1075
01:07:29,747 --> 01:07:34,343
<i>he restoreth my soul, he leads me
in the path of righteousness...</i>

1076
01:07:34,418 --> 01:07:36,352
for his name's sake.

1077
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:39,947
<i>Yea, though I walk...</i>

1078
01:07:40,024 --> 01:07:43,187
through the valley
of the shadow of death...

1079
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:46,229
I will fear no evil...

1080
01:07:46,296 --> 01:07:48,890
for thou art with me;

1081
01:07:48,966 --> 01:07:52,868
thy rod and thy staff...

1082
01:07:52,936 --> 01:07:55,097
they comfort me.

1083
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:58,164
Thou preparest a table before me...

1084
01:07:58,242 --> 01:08:01,302
in the presence of mine enemies.

1085
01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:04,040
Thou annointest my head with oil;

1086
01:08:04,114 --> 01:08:06,981
my cup runneth over.

1087
01:08:07,051 --> 01:08:11,317
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life...

1088
01:08:12,956 --> 01:08:16,323
and I will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever.

1089
01:08:18,629 --> 01:08:21,325
<i>- Your husband sleeps with mens?
- No.</i>

1090
01:08:21,398 --> 01:08:24,265
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord!

1091
01:08:24,334 --> 01:08:26,268
Ms. Honeycomb, let's be mindful.

1092
01:08:26,336 --> 01:08:29,999
<i>I know I shouldn't say this,
but I would have slit his lying throat.</i>

1093
01:08:30,074 --> 01:08:33,771
<i>- Sorry, Sister Dunn, but I would have.
- Greg, no disrespect...</i>

1094
01:08:33,844 --> 01:08:37,712
<i>- but I thinks all you gay, lowdown-
- Mm-hmm.</i>

1095
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:40,341
Down-loaded men is bringing that...

1096
01:08:40,417 --> 01:08:44,114
white homosexual disease
into our community.

1097
01:08:44,188 --> 01:08:48,215
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Spreadin' that Al DS and not tellin' nobody.

1098
01:08:48,292 --> 01:08:52,786
<i>It's a sin and a shame. And I had to
get it off my chest or else I'll bust.</i>

1099
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:54,956
- Sister Honeycomb-
- You interruptin' her.

1100
01:08:55,032 --> 01:08:58,229
I'm afraid for my daughters.
I'm afraid for my granddaughters.

1101
01:08:58,302 --> 01:09:01,567
<i>Lord, I'm afraid for 'em all,
and I'm sorry.</i>

1102
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:05,734
But it's your fault
for all your secrets and disease.

1103
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:08,243
<i>- So what are you saying about my son?
- Ladies!</i>

1104
01:09:08,312 --> 01:09:12,976
<i>First of all, it's not "down-loaded, '"
it's "down low. '"</i>

1105
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:14,745
<i>Whatever.</i>

1106
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:18,219
<i>- Secondly, I'm a homosexual man,
and I'm proud of that...
- Oh, Lord!</i>

1107
01:09:18,288 --> 01:09:21,780
<i>'cause I'm not keeping any secrets
from anybody- trust me.</i>

1108
01:09:21,859 --> 01:09:26,922
<i>It's impossible for any woman
to get anything from me.</i>

1109
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:28,658
- That's not the point.
- Sure ain't.

1110
01:09:28,732 --> 01:09:31,565
I don't condone what these men are doing!
I agree with you!

1111
01:09:31,635 --> 01:09:35,401
But can you realistically
expect anybody...

1112
01:09:35,472 --> 01:09:39,169
to confess anything
or to come out...

1113
01:09:39,243 --> 01:09:41,609
if they know this is the reception
they're gonna receive...

1114
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:43,646
this is how they're
gonna be treated?

1115
01:09:43,714 --> 01:09:46,410
What about the way they treatin'
our daughters and our granddaughters?

1116
01:09:46,483 --> 01:09:48,747
I'm not touching your daughters
or granddaughters. Ew!

1117
01:09:48,819 --> 01:09:53,085
<i>My son might be gay,
but I love him and he loves me.</i>

1118
01:09:53,157 --> 01:09:57,287
- What are you talking about?
- What do you mean? I'm talking about my son.

1119
01:09:57,361 --> 01:09:59,352
We are talking about Greg.

1120
01:09:59,429 --> 01:10:02,159
I thought we were supposed to be
talking about Val's problems?

1121
01:10:02,232 --> 01:10:06,328
<i>That's right, ladies. We are supposed
to be talking about Val's problems.</i>

1122
01:10:06,403 --> 01:10:09,304
<i>We are talking about
Val's problems. Right, Val?</i>

1123
01:10:09,373 --> 01:10:11,466
<i>- Well, l-
- We sure are.</i>

1124
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:14,602
<i>- Heavenly Father.
- Listen.</i>

1125
01:10:14,678 --> 01:10:18,170
Down-low men are only part
of this problem.

1126
01:10:18,248 --> 01:10:20,307
- A major part if you ask me.
- Mm-hmm.

1127
01:10:20,384 --> 01:10:22,682
Oh, really? What about prostitution?

1128
01:10:22,753 --> 01:10:27,486
Sharing drug needles?
Straight men going to Thailand and Brazil...

1129
01:10:27,558 --> 01:10:30,994
<i>on business trips
bringing H.I. V. and-</i>

1130
01:10:31,061 --> 01:10:33,962
<i>and other things back to their wives
and their girlfriends?</i>

1131
01:10:34,031 --> 01:10:37,398
- We're all guilty about something.
- That's right.

1132
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:42,530
<i>And by the way, I love God just
as much as you do.</i>

1133
01:10:42,606 --> 01:10:46,167
- But does he love you?
- Sister Honeycomb!

1134
01:10:46,243 --> 01:10:48,803
Look. God loves me and my son.

1135
01:10:48,879 --> 01:10:51,848
- Would you be quiet?
- Who you tellin' to be quiet, Boo?

1136
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:54,850
Mrs. Persons, would you please sit down!

1137
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:57,716
<i>- We are in church! We're in the house of the Lord.
- Yes.</i>

1138
01:10:57,788 --> 01:11:01,918
<i>Now, let's all look to God
and pray together...</i>

1139
01:11:01,992 --> 01:11:06,486
that he will help Val through
this terrible trial and be healed.

1140
01:11:06,563 --> 01:11:09,930
<i>Now let's join hands
and bow our heads.</i>

1141
01:11:11,401 --> 01:11:13,335
Charlotte.

1142
01:11:16,473 --> 01:11:19,909
- Yeah.
- How did you know about my husband?

1143
01:11:19,977 --> 01:11:23,970
I've been where you are.
My husband lives on the D.L., too...

1144
01:11:24,047 --> 01:11:26,515
but when you're
a famous entertainer...

1145
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:29,347
<i>people cut you a lot of slack.</i>

1146
01:11:29,419 --> 01:11:32,911
- You're Ryan's wife.
- We're legally separated.

1147
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:35,049
We have nothing together now.

1148
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:41,526
Well, I just want
to say... thank you.

1149
01:11:41,598 --> 01:11:44,465
<i>Thank you so much.
I don't know how I'm gonna repay you.</i>

1150
01:11:44,534 --> 01:11:47,867
- For what?
- Opening my eyes.

1151
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:54,376
It was difficult to find out that my marriage
has been a lie for all these years.

1152
01:11:56,146 --> 01:11:59,047
But I guess when you don't know
the truth, you can't make a choice.

1153
01:11:59,116 --> 01:12:03,450
The important thing
to remember, Val, is...

1154
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,852
they can't win by
telling the truth...

1155
01:12:07,925 --> 01:12:10,792
and we can't lose
by telling the truth.

1156
01:12:21,705 --> 01:12:24,538
<i>So what's happening, baby?
You coming back to me? Is that it?</i>

1157
01:12:24,608 --> 01:12:26,542
- No.
- No?

1158
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:30,273
- I'm ending it with you too.
- So, you're a leopard who
is gonna change his spots...

1159
01:12:30,347 --> 01:12:32,474
'cause he doesn't wanna
be a leopard anymore?

1160
01:12:32,549 --> 01:12:35,814
- You're D.L. all the way, baby.
You're gonna be back.
- Yeah?

1161
01:12:35,886 --> 01:12:38,411
- Can't have your cake and eat it too. Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

1162
01:12:38,488 --> 01:12:42,219
- Your marriage is proof of that.
- I think your marriage is proof of that.

1163
01:12:42,292 --> 01:12:45,625
You know, Monica and I got our thing together.
We have an arrangement.

1164
01:12:45,696 --> 01:12:48,221
- It's what's called an "arrangement."
- Oh, arrangement.

1165
01:12:48,298 --> 01:12:51,961
I told you that you need
to come clean with your girl, Val.

1166
01:12:52,035 --> 01:12:54,265
- You really do.
- What you doin'?

1167
01:12:54,338 --> 01:12:56,806
- I'm straightening up your tie. I like that tie.
- What are you doing?

1168
01:12:56,873 --> 01:12:58,807
Well, like it from a distance.
What you doin'?

1169
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,469
- I'm not playing with you, man.
- I'm not playing with you.

1170
01:13:01,545 --> 01:13:04,537
It's over.

1171
01:13:04,614 --> 01:13:08,106
<i>Oh, okay. It's over.
So you're gonna walk away just like that?</i>

1172
01:13:08,185 --> 01:13:12,781
Well, I'm gonna be right here when you come
back, baby, because Kevin knows who he is.

1173
01:13:12,856 --> 01:13:15,188
Everyone knows who Kevin is.

1174
01:13:15,258 --> 01:13:17,556
I am free. Kevin is free.

1175
01:13:17,627 --> 01:13:21,393
<i>'Cause you're D. L!
Go ahead.</i>

1176
01:13:21,465 --> 01:13:24,992
Are you gonna change your spots?
You can't change your spots!

1177
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:29,505
<i>You are nothin', baby.
Look at him! Look at him! He's a faggot!</i>

1178
01:13:29,573 --> 01:13:33,532
<i>He's a big-time punk!
Sissy.</i>

1179
01:13:37,881 --> 01:13:42,284
<i>Coming clean after I caught you
red-handed really doesn't mean that much.</i>

1180
01:13:44,721 --> 01:13:48,054
Yeah, but now there's-
there's no more secrets between us.

1181
01:13:51,795 --> 01:13:55,697
I love you, Val. We're supposed to
be together. I don't want you to leave.

1182
01:13:55,766 --> 01:14:00,863
You think you can do what you've done- live
a double life- and it's all supposed to go away?

1183
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:02,837
Why, Dutch, why?
Why you think that?

1184
01:14:02,906 --> 01:14:05,739
<i>- 'Cause you're cryin'?
- I can change.</i>

1185
01:14:05,809 --> 01:14:08,209
Val, I can change. I swear.

1186
01:14:08,278 --> 01:14:12,339
<i>- I swear to God I can change.
- I'm sorry, Dutch.</i>

1187
01:14:12,416 --> 01:14:15,010
I filed for divorce.

1188
01:14:15,085 --> 01:14:19,078
<i>This is what I get?</i>

1189
01:14:19,156 --> 01:14:21,624
This is what I get for being honest?

1190
01:14:21,691 --> 01:14:26,253
Val, I can't stand the thought
of losing you and Nicole. I need you.

1191
01:14:26,329 --> 01:14:30,265
- Baby, you can't walk out on me.
- You walked out on me...

1192
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:32,301
again and again and again.

1193
01:14:32,369 --> 01:14:36,533
Admit it.
You must have hated them-

1194
01:14:36,606 --> 01:14:38,904
both Dutch and Ryan.

1195
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,909
<i>- I would have.
- Hated them?</i>

1196
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:43,639
I wouldn't say hate.
I wouldn't say that.

1197
01:14:43,713 --> 01:14:46,181
After a betrayal like that?

1198
01:14:46,249 --> 01:14:49,776
Oh. I know you're a good Christian
and all of that.

1199
01:14:49,853 --> 01:14:53,448
- But a jury is gonna have a hard time believing-
- Detective.

1200
01:14:53,523 --> 01:14:55,548
I can assure you
that on that jury...

1201
01:14:55,625 --> 01:14:58,423
they will contain a number of good Christians
who won't have trouble believing.

1202
01:14:58,495 --> 01:15:00,588
Time is up.

1203
01:15:00,664 --> 01:15:03,428
- There's not much more to tell.
- Make it fast.

1204
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:07,596
Ryan Chambers and all that...

1205
01:15:07,671 --> 01:15:09,901
<i>it meant nothin' to me.</i>

1206
01:15:09,973 --> 01:15:15,605
<i>Baby, I swear to God. I swear to God,
it meant nothin'. It meant nothin' to me.</i>

1207
01:15:17,681 --> 01:15:22,015
You a hell of an actor. You sat there
and said them same things to me.

1208
01:15:22,085 --> 01:15:25,486
Sitting at my table. Only you
was sitting where she was sitting.

1209
01:15:25,555 --> 01:15:28,285
- I'm leaving.
- Sit your ass down.

1210
01:15:28,358 --> 01:15:30,849
- Get your hands off me.
- Don't you ever put your hands on my wife!

1211
01:15:30,927 --> 01:15:33,020
- Who do you think you are?
- Check it out.

1212
01:15:33,096 --> 01:15:35,121
- Don't you ever touch me again!
- He used me.

1213
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:37,928
- Just leave. This is between me and her. Just leave.
- You lied to us.

1214
01:15:38,001 --> 01:15:40,526
- You used everybody.
- We have an emergency.

1215
01:15:40,604 --> 01:15:42,469
- Good night.
- Just get out.

1216
01:15:42,539 --> 01:15:44,632
- Let me give you a little hot tip.
- Take your hands off her!

1217
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:49,202
You can tell the tabloids this, okay?
Ryan Chambers is H.I.V. positive, honey.

1218
01:15:49,279 --> 01:15:50,940
- What did you say?
- Have you lost your natural mind?

1219
01:15:51,014 --> 01:15:54,472
Hold up. Stop.
What did you say?

1220
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:57,213
Ryan Chambers is H.I.V. positive.

1221
01:15:58,522 --> 01:16:01,013
What have you done?

1222
01:16:01,091 --> 01:16:03,355
What have you done to me?

1223
01:16:05,095 --> 01:16:08,963
<i>What have you done to me?
What have you done to me?</i>

1224
01:16:09,032 --> 01:16:11,728
Bye, sweetheart.
Happy holidays.

1225
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:14,065
We'll miss you, sweetheart.

1226
01:16:14,137 --> 01:16:16,970
<i>Man, I hate you!</i>

1227
01:16:18,909 --> 01:16:20,809
- I hate you, you know that!
- Hey! Hey, sir!

1228
01:16:20,877 --> 01:16:24,574
- I'll kill you. I hate you.
- Put it down! Drop the knife!

1229
01:16:24,648 --> 01:16:27,742
- I love you, and you love me.
- You love yourself.

1230
01:16:27,817 --> 01:16:29,910
- Man, I hate you!
- Drop the weapon and step away!

1231
01:16:29,986 --> 01:16:32,682
<i>Now!</i>

1232
01:16:33,823 --> 01:16:35,723
<i>I said put it down!</i>

1233
01:16:35,792 --> 01:16:38,158
<i>I love you.</i>

1234
01:16:38,228 --> 01:16:40,662
Go to hell!
God don't want you.

1235
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:43,324
<i>- Don't worry, Mr. Chambers. We
have everything under control.
- He just went off.</i>

1236
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:48,201
You'll burn in hell for this.
You gonna burn in hell for this, Ryan.

1237
01:16:48,271 --> 01:16:50,068
- Calm down!
- You'll burn in hell for this!

1238
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:53,303
<i>Let's go!
I said calm down!</i>

1239
01:16:53,376 --> 01:16:56,436
You'll burn in hell for this!

1240
01:16:56,513 --> 01:16:59,004
<i>- Come on.
- You go to hell!</i>

1241
01:17:08,058 --> 01:17:10,049
Cute.

1242
01:17:14,664 --> 01:17:16,723
<i>Open the gate!</i>

1243
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,734
Robert Mass?

1244
01:17:18,802 --> 01:17:20,793
Your bail was posted.

1245
01:17:22,105 --> 01:17:24,699
- By who?
- Step out.

1246
01:17:26,243 --> 01:17:28,438
<i>Let's go!</i>

1247
01:17:34,284 --> 01:17:37,481
Thanks for bailing me out, Dad.

1248
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:48,790
It's true, isn't it?

1249
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,330
You put your family in danger.

1250
01:17:52,402 --> 01:17:55,997
You don't put...

1251
01:17:56,072 --> 01:17:58,506
your family in danger.

1252
01:17:58,575 --> 01:18:00,475
<i>Pops-</i>

1253
01:18:08,585 --> 01:18:12,419
This is not what Mass men do.

1254
01:18:12,489 --> 01:18:14,684
I tried to tell you-

1255
01:18:18,161 --> 01:18:22,757
I tried to tell you.
You were so proud of me!

1256
01:18:22,832 --> 01:18:27,098
Thief! You stole my granddaughter,
my family, my life.

1257
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:32,335
<i>- You took every single thing l-
- I tried to tell you.</i>

1258
01:18:32,409 --> 01:18:34,502
So many times.

1259
01:18:35,545 --> 01:18:37,536
Listen to me.

1260
01:18:39,082 --> 01:18:41,073
This is who I am!

1261
01:18:42,185 --> 01:18:44,415
This is Dutch!

1262
01:18:44,487 --> 01:18:47,217
I'm not your perfect son.

1263
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:50,550
I can't be what it is
you want me to be!

1264
01:18:55,755 --> 01:18:59,987
<i>This is Dutch. This is Dutch.
This is who I am.</i>

1265
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:02,620
This is who I am!

1266
01:19:04,898 --> 01:19:07,230
This is who I am!

1267
01:19:34,227 --> 01:19:37,287
I don't know why I'm here.

1268
01:19:37,364 --> 01:19:41,460
Then get on your knees, and don't get off
until you've found the answer.

1269
01:19:41,535 --> 01:19:43,059
You judging me?

1270
01:19:43,136 --> 01:19:47,129
What happened to judge
not lest ye be judged?

1271
01:19:47,207 --> 01:19:49,198
What happened to that?

1272
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:56,708
I'm not judging you, son.

1273
01:19:56,783 --> 01:20:01,083
I do have a question. Are you saying
that what you did was right?

1274
01:20:01,154 --> 01:20:05,955
No. I'm not saying I was right.

1275
01:20:06,026 --> 01:20:08,494
But maybe I did the best I could.

1276
01:20:08,562 --> 01:20:10,496
You believe that?

1277
01:20:10,564 --> 01:20:13,465
How far you think that's
gonna fly with the Lord?

1278
01:20:13,533 --> 01:20:17,469
It's cruel and selfish to bring
a possible death sentence...

1279
01:20:17,537 --> 01:20:20,904
to those you say you love
for a few moments...

1280
01:20:20,974 --> 01:20:22,942
of lust and pleasure.

1281
01:20:23,009 --> 01:20:26,035
You think I don't know that?

1282
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:29,206
Yeah, I'm a coward...

1283
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:32,741
and I'm afraid.

1284
01:20:34,354 --> 01:20:37,482
What would have happened
if I'd been honest?

1285
01:20:40,393 --> 01:20:42,384
I'd be called a sinner.

1286
01:20:42,462 --> 01:20:48,423
A homo. A fag.
Do you know how hypocritical that is...

1287
01:20:48,501 --> 01:20:51,061
when you look at the D.L. brothers
in your own congregation?

1288
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:55,836
Are you suggesting that the imperfection
of the sinners in my church...

1289
01:20:55,909 --> 01:20:59,572
is the reason you betrayed
your wife and child?

1290
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:05,111
I'm used to people lying to me, son.

1291
01:21:05,185 --> 01:21:08,313
You're lying to yourself.
That's the worst of it.

1292
01:21:08,388 --> 01:21:12,324
We both know that if I'd been honest,
I'd have lost everything.

1293
01:21:12,392 --> 01:21:17,159
I hate to break the news to you, son.
You lost everything.

1294
01:21:18,865 --> 01:21:21,891
- Except-
- Except what?

1295
01:21:21,968 --> 01:21:24,095
Redemption.

1296
01:21:25,905 --> 01:21:29,500
God don't hold grudges.

1297
01:21:29,576 --> 01:21:31,510
His hands is always
stretched out to us...

1298
01:21:31,578 --> 01:21:34,240
whether we're riding
the chariots of grace...

1299
01:21:34,314 --> 01:21:37,078
or crushed beneath the wheels.

1300
01:21:39,586 --> 01:21:43,955
He's there.
He's there waiting for you.

1301
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:48,757
The longer you wait,
the harder it's gonna be.

1302
01:21:48,828 --> 01:21:51,023
But you have to call him.

1303
01:21:52,966 --> 01:21:54,957
Just call him, son.

1304
01:21:57,137 --> 01:21:59,401
Call him now.

1305
01:22:20,627 --> 01:22:24,085
<i>Number 16. Number 16.</i>

1306
01:22:25,398 --> 01:22:26,990
- Hi.
- Hi.

1307
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:29,035
I'm here to be tested.

1308
01:22:29,102 --> 01:22:32,833
Take this number, and someone
will be with you as soon as possible.

1309
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:34,897
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1310
01:22:36,676 --> 01:22:38,667
<i>Number 17.</i>

1311
01:22:57,163 --> 01:22:59,256
<i>Number 18.</i>

1312
01:23:09,843 --> 01:23:13,370
Ms. Valerie Mass, your time is up,
and the offer's off the table.

1313
01:23:13,446 --> 01:23:15,414
- What are you talking about?
- You're being charged with first-degree murder.

1314
01:23:15,482 --> 01:23:18,849
<i>Are you out of your mind? Valerie,
I'll have you out of here in no time.</i>

1315
01:23:18,918 --> 01:23:23,617
- Detective Hicks, I'm innocent.
- I know you don't care about
this girl's guilt or innocence.

1316
01:23:23,690 --> 01:23:27,217
- Get out of my face.
- There's a long way between here and conviction...

1317
01:23:27,293 --> 01:23:29,261
<i>Assistant D.A.</i>

1318
01:23:29,329 --> 01:23:34,289
<i>And you tell me, where do you think you're
gonna be when this case blows up in your face?</i>

1319
01:23:36,903 --> 01:23:40,270
The election will be over by then.

1320
01:24:08,134 --> 01:24:10,295
Valerie Mass.
Number 225.

1321
01:24:23,049 --> 01:24:27,179
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,
I would like to-

1322
01:24:27,253 --> 01:24:29,721
<i>Excuse me.</i>

1323
01:24:31,524 --> 01:24:34,015
I'm sorry. We're going to have to delay
this press conference...

1324
01:24:34,093 --> 01:24:36,493
<i>for about five minutes or so.</i>

1325
01:24:36,563 --> 01:24:40,431
Now this is still a breaking story.

1326
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:42,434
Can you tell us what happened,
Mr. Simmons?

1327
01:24:42,502 --> 01:24:46,233
This better be worth my while.
What exactly is on this DVD?

1328
01:24:46,306 --> 01:24:48,968
Well, I've only watched a few seconds,
and I already know...

1329
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:52,273
that you can't go to the press conference
without checking this out.

1330
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:57,443
This was delivered to the front desk
addressed to Valerie Mass.

1331
01:24:58,485 --> 01:25:00,385
<i>- And who's it from?
- "To Valerie Mass.</i>

1332
01:25:00,453 --> 01:25:05,356
A gift from me and my ex.
Charlotte Chambers."

1333
01:25:07,694 --> 01:25:10,891
- Talk.
- What do you want me to say?

1334
01:25:10,964 --> 01:25:13,296
I am who I am.

1335
01:25:14,934 --> 01:25:18,893
Or if you're watching this-
who I was.

1336
01:25:18,972 --> 01:25:20,803
What is this?

1337
01:25:20,874 --> 01:25:23,638
It's beginning to look like
that confession you wanted.

1338
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:26,907
<i>My death, like my life, will be spectacular.</i>

1339
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:32,111
What do you do when someone
you trust gives you a gift?

1340
01:25:32,185 --> 01:25:35,245
A disease without any warning.

1341
01:25:35,321 --> 01:25:39,052
Well, you can't blame me
for wanting to share the gift.

1342
01:25:39,125 --> 01:25:41,958
Yes, I'm sorry.

1343
01:25:42,028 --> 01:25:45,020
But who is sorry for me?

1344
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:49,626
For those of you I might
have hurt, what can I say?

1345
01:25:49,702 --> 01:25:52,102
Be more careful.

1346
01:25:52,171 --> 01:25:54,662
You never know where
the bogeyman is.

1347
01:25:56,409 --> 01:26:00,812
<i>And those of you who wanna
make judgment, hell, it ain't my fault.</i>

1348
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:04,782
<i>You want guys like us
to be open and honest...</i>

1349
01:26:04,851 --> 01:26:08,446
<i>so you can publicly
humiliate us and condemn us.</i>

1350
01:26:08,521 --> 01:26:12,048
<i>I might be a coward,
but I ain't stupid.</i>

1351
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:15,856
I will never let you
treat me like that. Never!

1352
01:26:15,929 --> 01:26:18,022
I'll play the monster.

1353
01:26:19,666 --> 01:26:21,691
And I'm just like you.

1354
01:26:23,136 --> 01:26:26,299
I never thought
it would happen to me.

1355
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:30,675
<i>And, yes...</i>

1356
01:26:30,743 --> 01:26:33,268
the bogeyman is for real.

1357
01:26:37,817 --> 01:26:40,786
I'm gonna give you more
of a chance than you gave me.

1358
01:26:50,063 --> 01:26:51,724
Bravo.

1359
01:26:56,336 --> 01:26:58,270
Thank you, Detective.

1360
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:00,306
Captain would be better.

1361
01:27:01,741 --> 01:27:03,675
Captain.

1362
01:27:07,714 --> 01:27:11,582
Well, I am pleased to announce
that after a vigorous...

1363
01:27:11,651 --> 01:27:14,017
<i>and thorough investigation...</i>

1364
01:27:14,087 --> 01:27:16,681
my department has freed
an innocent woman...

1365
01:27:16,756 --> 01:27:19,418
who was falsely accused
of first-degree murder.

1366
01:27:19,492 --> 01:27:22,518
<i>Now regardless of my political ambition-</i>

1367
01:27:22,662 --> 01:27:27,497
<i>Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.</i>

1368
01:27:27,567 --> 01:27:30,001
Give us this day our daily bread...

1369
01:27:30,069 --> 01:27:32,060
<i>and forgive us our trespasses...</i>

1370
01:27:32,138 --> 01:27:34,368
<i>as we forgive those
who trespass against us.</i>

1371
01:27:38,911 --> 01:27:41,072
And lead us not into temptation-

1372
01:27:41,147 --> 01:27:45,311
For all of us, there is light.
But passion...

1373
01:27:45,385 --> 01:27:48,445
<i>without responsibility...</i>

1374
01:27:48,521 --> 01:27:51,285
<i>is not only
a self-destructive act...</i>

1375
01:27:51,357 --> 01:27:55,487
<i>but like the godless stone
of ignorance...</i>

1376
01:27:55,561 --> 01:27:58,052
<i>dropped in the rippling pond
of tragedy.</i>

1377
01:27:58,131 --> 01:28:00,998
<i>In this day and these times...</i>

1378
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:05,367
<i>it can destroy
those we love the most.</i>

1379
01:28:05,438 --> 01:28:09,340
<i>- Charlotte's suicide will
not keep her from God's arms.
- Thank you.</i>

1380
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:13,345
If a man does not seek humility...

1381
01:28:13,413 --> 01:28:15,938
<i>humility will seek man.</i>

1382
01:28:37,522 --> 01:28:39,513
Thank you for coming.

1383
01:28:41,426 --> 01:28:44,156
Are you okay?

1384
01:28:45,797 --> 01:28:49,961
It'll be good
to be back home again...

1385
01:28:50,035 --> 01:28:51,969
running my own studio.

1386
01:29:01,013 --> 01:29:03,777
<i>I just want you to know...</i>

1387
01:29:03,849 --> 01:29:07,216
that none of this is your fault.

1388
01:29:08,854 --> 01:29:11,914
<i>There's nothing
you could have done...</i>

1389
01:29:11,990 --> 01:29:14,982
<i>that would have made a difference.</i>

1390
01:29:19,398 --> 01:29:22,196
I've been tested and, uh...

1391
01:29:22,267 --> 01:29:25,065
they didn't find anything.

1392
01:29:25,137 --> 01:29:27,128
Same with me.

1393
01:29:31,576 --> 01:29:33,510
Val, I told you-

1394
01:29:33,578 --> 01:29:35,910
You know, I've been struggling with this.

1395
01:29:38,884 --> 01:29:40,852
Was I the friend
you needed me to be?

1396
01:29:40,919 --> 01:29:43,911
Was I the wife you needed me to be?

1397
01:29:43,989 --> 01:29:47,755
Was I the Christian
you needed me to be?

1398
01:29:50,529 --> 01:29:54,158
And... could you have stopped?

1399
01:29:58,170 --> 01:30:00,104
Could you?

1400
01:30:05,277 --> 01:30:07,404
I don't know.

1401
01:30:14,986 --> 01:30:16,977
I love you, Dutch.

1402
01:30:21,593 --> 01:30:25,552
But I can't...
trust you anymore.

1403
01:30:52,324 --> 01:30:54,986
<i>- Daddy!
- Hey, sweetheart.</i>

1404
01:30:58,430 --> 01:31:00,421
Oh!

1405
01:31:02,167 --> 01:31:04,362
I love you.

1406
01:31:04,436 --> 01:31:06,427
I love you more.

1407
01:31:10,709 --> 01:31:12,768
My beautiful girl.

1408
01:31:14,913 --> 01:31:16,676
- Be good. Okay?
- Okay.

1409
01:31:17,682 --> 01:31:19,547
Okay, go to Mama.

1410
01:31:34,766 --> 01:31:36,757
All right.

1411
01:31:42,774 --> 01:31:44,765
I love you, Son.

1412
01:32:53,111 --> 01:32:55,671
Are you showing the house?

1413
01:32:57,849 --> 01:33:01,307
Not now. Uh, the Realtor
will be here tomorrow.

1414
01:33:01,386 --> 01:33:03,479
Why don't you come back then?

1415
01:33:03,555 --> 01:33:05,614
You hear that, baby?

1416
01:33:05,690 --> 01:33:09,148
We might have just found
the house of our dreams.

1417
01:33:09,227 --> 01:33:12,788
Hey, um, you mind
if I look around inside?

1418
01:33:12,864 --> 01:33:16,823
It's dusty around here. You look like
you got something in your eye.

1419
01:33:16,901 --> 01:33:19,426
What did you say?

1420
01:33:19,504 --> 01:33:23,565
I think you got something in your eye.
You want me to blow it out for you?

1421
01:33:30,081 --> 01:33:32,072
Hey.

1422
01:33:33,652 --> 01:33:36,519
We'll come back
and look another day, okay?
