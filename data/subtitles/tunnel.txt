1
00:01:08,204 --> 00:01:10,198
You all right, boss?

2
00:01:11,287 --> 00:01:12,802
Yeah.

3
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:14,251
Are the kids all right?

4
00:01:14,292 --> 00:01:16,569
Yeah, everyone's fine.
Thank you.

5
00:01:16,614 --> 00:01:19,176
Well, what are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at home?

6
00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:21,450
I'm waiting for someone.

7
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:26,052
Flipping carbon monoxide, eh?

8
00:01:27,265 --> 00:01:30,102
I went to this flat last year.
Three dead students,

9
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:32,906
with some rip-off landlord
who wouldn't mend the boiler.

10
00:01:32,953 --> 00:01:35,992
Mine's a blocked flue. Apparently.

11
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,998
Nah, they wouldn't, boss.

12
00:01:41,042 --> 00:01:43,638
I'm afraid, I think...

13
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:49,929
Boss...

14
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:56,497
You wouldn't hit a man wearing
two cups of coffee, would you?

15
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:58,371
I'll do more than that.
You attacked my family.

16
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,335
No, I didn't.
You fucking listening to me?

17
00:02:01,384 --> 00:02:03,296
Yeah.

18
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:06,182
When you want to know the truth,
come see me in the office.

19
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:15,391
* Venez dans mes bras *

20
00:02:16,383 --> 00:02:19,009
* Closer to me, dear *

21
00:02:19,731 --> 00:02:22,936
* Donnez-vous a moi *

22
00:02:23,037 --> 00:02:25,288
* Set aside all fear *

23
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:32,786
* Restons sans laisser pour l'eternite *

24
00:02:33,526 --> 00:02:36,090
* Yes, you shall be mine *

25
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:44,098
* Till the end of time *

26
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:03,170
Louise, I apologize for yesterday.

27
00:03:03,668 --> 00:03:07,164
Well, okay.
No, you were right about the phone.

28
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:09,299
OK.

29
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,605
I still believe...

30
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:14,532
that there is a simpler explanation.
But you were right to bring it to my attention.

31
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:17,015
Thank you.
You're a very good agent.

32
00:03:22,356 --> 00:03:24,550
Would you like to see what I found?

33
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,753
Yes.

34
00:03:35,284 --> 00:03:36,485
Elise...

35
00:03:39,824 --> 00:03:43,814
You're will be better leader,
if you stop trying to be one.

36
00:03:45,031 --> 00:03:49,276
I don't care if you remember my birthday.
I really don't...

37
00:03:49,478 --> 00:03:51,540
A reprimand is always been part of the job.

38
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,864
OK.

39
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,663
This is the surveillance video
from the phone shop in Hamburg.

40
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:07,474
The purchase was made with
a credit card at 10:38.

41
00:04:10,406 --> 00:04:11,695
But she's not in the queue.

42
00:04:13,772 --> 00:04:14,903
Zoom in.

43
00:04:18,685 --> 00:04:21,452
What's that logo on his cap?
Looks like an eight.

44
00:04:23,802 --> 00:04:25,716
We don't know who he is.

45
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,393
I could magnify more...

46
00:04:50,853 --> 00:04:53,050
It wasn't us.
Who was it, then?

47
00:04:53,976 --> 00:04:55,411
You ever considered the idea

48
00:04:55,457 --> 00:04:57,735
you didn't have your
boiler properly serviced?

49
00:04:57,781 --> 00:04:59,100
Yeah, that's the problem isn't it?

50
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:01,214
There's always a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

51
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:02,494
That must be frustrating with us,.

52
00:05:02,545 --> 00:05:04,617
because the explanation is reasonable

53
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:06,182
doesn't mean it isn't true.

54
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:11,312
Who are you, anyway?
I mean, do you have an alias or something?

55
00:05:11,915 --> 00:05:13,875
I have several.

56
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:15,831
I also have a name. It's Neil Gray.

57
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:20,475
Your stunt with Vanessa Hamilton
cost us a potential asset.

58
00:05:20,526 --> 00:05:22,439
And contrary to popular myth,

59
00:05:22,487 --> 00:05:26,086
we don't go round knocking people off.
Especially kids!

60
00:05:26,132 --> 00:05:28,853
You don't seem to have too many scruples
about all the young girls murdered

61
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:30,488
at the hands of Vanessa Hamilton.

62
00:05:30,536 --> 00:05:33,053
Remind me to show you a photo of
what happens when a bomb goes off

63
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,819
in a crowded tube carriage.
Oh, please!

64
00:05:34,862 --> 00:05:37,139
You might not rush to judge so quickly.

65
00:05:37,185 --> 00:05:40,338
The Baturins paid the defense
to bring down that plane.

66
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:42,858
I'll be arresting Artem Baturin for that crime.

67
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:45,985
Our little friend has a
"Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free" card.

68
00:05:47,115 --> 00:05:49,028
'The Chemist'?

69
00:05:49,437 --> 00:05:50,793
If Edgar Branco is alive,

70
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,877
he is a walking weapon of mass destruction.

71
00:05:52,922 --> 00:05:54,994
So we find him, we remove the leverage.

72
00:05:55,045 --> 00:05:57,163
We don't just give in.

73
00:05:58,487 --> 00:06:01,244
Or have you already done the deal?

74
00:06:06,096 --> 00:06:07,975
There's a bigger picture here, Karl!

75
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:09,932
Don't tell me, "It involves tough choices."

76
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,540
That's the problem with clichÃ©s.

77
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,384
I told Bowden. Now I gonna tell you.
Don't need to tell me. I know what you're gonna say.

78
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:16,384
And don't think of removing me from my job,

79
00:06:16,427 --> 00:06:18,466
because I will go public on Stefan Czyrko. Yeah!

80
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,738
Olivier, this is Elise. Call me, it's urgent.

81
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:21,653
Armed guards will be present at
all times during your stay here.

82
00:07:26,802 --> 00:07:28,749
How lovely!
_

83
00:07:29,028 --> 00:07:31,387
Football! Aha!

84
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:34,230
You and me, match!

85
00:07:35,156 --> 00:07:38,391
Me, er...champion. Tskhinvali.

86
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:41,196
Nobody beat Gregor.

87
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,398
That is, France. Russia.

88
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,725
You think we'll let you pass? Thick peasant.

89
00:07:49,451 --> 00:07:50,887
_
When my boy comes back,

90
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:52,646
_
we beat your French police asses.

91
00:07:52,747 --> 00:07:55,449
_
He best fucking lawyer.

92
00:07:57,004 --> 00:07:58,005
One...

93
00:07:58,601 --> 00:07:59,603
two...

94
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:00,803
three!

95
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:20,122
Yes?

96
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,523
Hi, it's me. Can I come up?

97
00:08:46,995 --> 00:08:49,956
Hello.
You came back early.

98
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:52,755
I took the night train.
I really wanted to see you.

99
00:08:53,403 --> 00:08:55,874
Look, I bought you some real books.

100
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:04,250
Hope you like Pablo Neruda.

101
00:09:05,616 --> 00:09:07,927
I don't read poetry.

102
00:09:10,942 --> 00:09:14,177
What's wrong?
Who's the man in the "8" cap?

103
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:15,980
What?

104
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:19,182
The man who followed Bresson
into the toilets at the airport.

105
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:21,065
I don't know what you're talking about.

106
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:27,953
My colleague, Karl,
he remained suspicious of you.

107
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,278
I know that.
And I defended you.

108
00:09:30,323 --> 00:09:32,476
Good.

109
00:09:32,527 --> 00:09:33,880
I wanted to clear your name.

110
00:09:33,927 --> 00:09:36,490
I wanted so much to clear your name, but I can't.

111
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,205
I don't understand.

112
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:40,405
The man who follows Bresson in the airport

113
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:42,653
is the same one who buys his phone in Hamburg.

114
00:09:42,697 --> 00:09:45,774
No. I bought his phone.
You can check my credit card...

115
00:09:45,822 --> 00:09:47,176
I have.

116
00:09:47,903 --> 00:09:49,543
And the CCTV footage of the store

117
00:09:49,586 --> 00:09:51,578
where the phone was purchased.

118
00:09:51,628 --> 00:09:53,940
The same man stole your passport from Bresson

119
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,187
so you couldn't board the flight.

120
00:09:59,677 --> 00:10:02,513
Was it a lie about your twin brother as well?

121
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:06,881
No.

122
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:12,129
Listen to me.

123
00:10:12,171 --> 00:10:14,049
Sit down, please, I want to explain.

124
00:10:14,092 --> 00:10:15,653
You're a murderer.

125
00:10:16,536 --> 00:10:19,133
All those people died because of you.

126
00:10:19,178 --> 00:10:21,615
We are on different sides, Elise, but...

127
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,576
And I don't understand why you chose yours.

128
00:10:30,591 --> 00:10:33,347
It was true about Colonia Dignidad.

129
00:10:34,316 --> 00:10:38,073
My brother did vanish into the
hands of Nazis and pedophiles.

130
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,116
I was repeatedly raped by visitors to that place.

131
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:46,716
Underneath the colony there were cables.

132
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:48,328
Do you know where they went?

133
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,203
Langley, Virginia.

134
00:10:52,255 --> 00:10:54,647
The CIA knew everything about that place.

135
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:57,739
They were watching the tapes
of the rapes and the torture.

136
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,261
You don't know that.

137
00:10:59,302 --> 00:11:02,139
Colonia Dignidad was at the
heart of Covert Operations

138
00:11:02,187 --> 00:11:03,779
in Latin America.

139
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:06,025
The CIA were heavily involved.

140
00:11:06,071 --> 00:11:08,668
That's not an opinion or a conspiracy theory.

141
00:11:08,714 --> 00:11:10,274
But...

142
00:11:11,356 --> 00:11:13,634
Bresson was opposed to all of it.

143
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,673
Yes.
Then why?

144
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:17,442
Being right about one thing

145
00:11:17,484 --> 00:11:19,794
didn't make him right about everything.

146
00:11:21,808 --> 00:11:24,644
Both sides do bad things in wars.

147
00:11:25,413 --> 00:11:29,125
I just chose the side I thought
was the least hypocritical.

148
00:11:29,496 --> 00:11:31,375
You think this is a war?

149
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,573
It's a series of engagements.

150
00:11:36,304 --> 00:11:38,662
The art is knowing when to stop.

151
00:11:38,706 --> 00:11:41,177
Well, this stops with you in prison.

152
00:11:52,442 --> 00:11:53,842
Move away, Elise.

153
00:11:55,605 --> 00:11:57,725
You'd really shoot me?

154
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,530
Then none of it was true.

155
00:12:01,572 --> 00:12:05,490
I let somebody put a camera in your flat.
And I watched you.

156
00:12:06,138 --> 00:12:09,418
I watched you argue with your...idiot boyfriend

157
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:12,024
and I judged it a good time to
come over and get you into bed.

158
00:12:15,187 --> 00:12:17,500
You mean nothing to me, Elise.

159
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,429
But believe me now,
I will not hesitate to shoot you

160
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,467
if you do not move away from that door.

161
00:12:56,114 --> 00:12:57,433
Miss Klein?

162
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:24,744
You OK?
Ah, it's nothing.

163
00:13:26,988 --> 00:13:29,184
Graze from a nine mil Makarov.

164
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:31,345
She only wanted to knock me over,

165
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,272
and she knew exactly what she was doing.

166
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,346
Who's she working for?

167
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,879
I think it's obvious.

168
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,673
The Russians.

169
00:13:41,524 --> 00:13:44,120
So Gregor Baturin has powerful friends in Moscow.

170
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:46,967
None of whom would be sad to
see the back of Paul Bresson.

171
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:50,849
He has been a thorn in their
side over human rights.

172
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:55,253
It explains the extravagance issue, right?

173
00:13:55,779 --> 00:13:59,139
Baturin kills a few enemies by hacking a plane.

174
00:13:59,183 --> 00:14:00,664
They give the West a warning.

175
00:14:01,265 --> 00:14:03,259
"Look what we can do."

176
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,342
Hmm.

177
00:14:08,274 --> 00:14:09,788
Think we'll see her again?

178
00:14:10,515 --> 00:14:12,668
They'll get her out if they have any sense.

179
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:14,952
The answer is 'The Chemist'.

180
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:17,923
We need to find Edgar Branco.

181
00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:21,119
Without him, Koba has nothing. We can arrest him.

182
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:25,932
I agree with that.

183
00:14:25,974 --> 00:14:28,934
Then go and find him. But hurry.

184
00:14:28,976 --> 00:14:31,937
Because it won't be long before
the Baturins are in Ossetia

185
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,620
and out of your reach for good.

186
00:14:53,004 --> 00:14:54,802
Aah! Goal!

187
00:14:55,807 --> 00:14:57,764
Oh, you fucking French pussies.

188
00:14:57,808 --> 00:15:00,167
You...I am king of...Tskhinvali.

189
00:15:01,413 --> 00:15:03,532
You...suck my...

190
00:15:07,394 --> 00:15:08,359
Shit!

191
00:15:11,476 --> 00:15:14,066
Quick, call an ambulance. Hurry!

192
00:15:20,715 --> 00:15:22,115
Yeah?
Sir.

193
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,389
Gregor Baturin's had a heart attack. He's dead.

194
00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:28,442
All bets are off, then.

195
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:35,039
Yes?
Sir, Gregor Baturin is dead.

196
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:38,373
Yes?

197
00:15:38,374 --> 00:15:41,352
.
.
.
We were tricked. They killed him.

198
00:15:45,014 --> 00:15:46,168
I'll warn Koba.
_

199
00:15:46,975 --> 00:15:49,370
We must do everything possible to get him out.
_

200
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,184
and if he has Branco and
he can move him in time,

201
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,504
there's gonna be payback.

202
00:15:53,551 --> 00:15:55,783
So...he'll be certain it was us.

203
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:57,667
First thing on his mind will be revenge.

204
00:15:57,716 --> 00:15:59,913
We have to neutralize Koba before he finds out.

205
00:15:59,957 --> 00:16:01,917
He's at Calais, at the Eurotunnel terminus.

206
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,113
I'll alert the French.
Shall we hold back, sir?

207
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,395
No, we must detain him immediately.

208
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:09,203
Niedermayer was a great player.

209
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:12,210
He could always turn a defensive position

210
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:14,210
into an offensive rush.

211
00:16:14,254 --> 00:16:16,407
Incredible.

212
00:16:16,817 --> 00:16:18,730
Yes?

213
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:33,644
Get out! Get out!

214
00:16:33,808 --> 00:16:35,412
Hands up!
Get down!

215
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:37,554
Stay down!

216
00:16:40,145 --> 00:16:42,725
Get down!
Koba is not in the car. He escaped.

217
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:44,116
Hands up!

218
00:17:08,887 --> 00:17:11,096
We have an intruder alert in sector 6,

219
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,238
He's in the Calais tunnel maintenance area,

220
00:17:15,281 --> 00:17:17,958
so we have him cornered?

221
00:17:18,566 --> 00:17:21,037
Look, there's nowhere for him to go.

222
00:17:32,253 --> 00:17:34,031
The helicopter is inbound.
_

223
00:17:35,824 --> 00:17:38,413
Flying West to the site.
_

224
00:17:49,675 --> 00:17:51,189
Stop! Police. Freeze.

225
00:18:26,922 --> 00:18:29,279
Sir, we have a report that
a helicopter is inbound.

226
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:30,964
OK. Right, tell them...

227
00:18:32,048 --> 00:18:34,200
Oh, shoot the fucker down!

228
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,165
Sir, safety...
No, I don't care about safety!

229
00:18:37,213 --> 00:18:39,332
Do not let him get away!

230
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:05,580
He got on to the helicopter.

231
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:07,980
Do you have a clear shot at Baturin?

232
00:19:09,201 --> 00:19:10,217
No, negative.

233
00:19:10,354 --> 00:19:11,450
Report back.

234
00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:27,861
Oh...fuck!

235
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,374
What happened here?

236
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:55,137
She said she was watching me.

237
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,933
I was looking for devices.

238
00:19:58,423 --> 00:20:00,222
You were very thorough.

239
00:20:00,546 --> 00:20:02,699
Did you find anything?

240
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:05,501
No.

241
00:20:09,757 --> 00:20:11,076
What do you want?

242
00:20:11,117 --> 00:20:13,237
Gregor Baturin's dead.

243
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,321
Oh, shit.

244
00:20:15,363 --> 00:20:17,162
Yeah, that's the consensus view.

245
00:20:17,204 --> 00:20:18,720
So he'll think that...

246
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:20,247
We did it.

247
00:20:20,288 --> 00:20:22,645
Well, it's the only reasonable thing to think.

248
00:20:22,691 --> 00:20:24,969
Not that the fat, chain-smoking fucker

249
00:20:25,013 --> 00:20:27,246
had arteries like a Victorian sewer.

250
00:20:27,296 --> 00:20:28,696
Where is Artem now?

251
00:20:28,738 --> 00:20:31,413
He took a short helicopter ride out of Sangatte,

252
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:34,182
then proceeded in a car to fuck knows where.

253
00:20:34,223 --> 00:20:37,059
So that's your grubby little
deal up the Swanee, is it?

254
00:20:38,628 --> 00:20:40,144
Get back to the UK now.

255
00:20:40,191 --> 00:20:43,391
We've got to find 'The Chemist'
before Koba moves him.

256
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,272
Come on. We've been summonsed by the dark side.

257
00:20:54,278 --> 00:20:56,766
.
.
_
He's no longer himself after his father's death.

258
00:20:58,503 --> 00:21:01,992
.
.
_
The old man may have had a heart attack.

259
00:21:04,886 --> 00:21:07,141
.
.
_
I'll call back when we need the helicopter.

260
00:21:27,563 --> 00:21:28,998
They murdered him.

261
00:21:29,486 --> 00:21:31,922
We're still not sure about that,
but we'll find out.

262
00:21:32,648 --> 00:21:35,962
I'm gonna give 'The Chemist' to ISIS as a present.

263
00:21:36,012 --> 00:21:38,449
They gonna have bubonic plague for this.

264
00:21:38,496 --> 00:21:40,134
Don't do anything for now.

265
00:21:40,176 --> 00:21:42,535
Leave 'The Chemist' until
we know what to do next.

266
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:44,971
Moving him can be very dangerous now.

267
00:21:45,022 --> 00:21:47,983
We are making arrangements to
get you out of France.

268
00:21:48,787 --> 00:21:52,465
I'm not leaving without making sure they pay.

269
00:21:53,031 --> 00:21:57,028
Don't do anything. Lie low, wait for orders.

270
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,160
I don't take orders from anybody now.

271
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:11,000
Go to this hotel and wait for us
to arrange your exit.

272
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:12,964
I'll leave with you.

273
00:22:15,016 --> 00:22:17,407
I'm very sorry about your father.

274
00:22:47,732 --> 00:22:50,202
Vanessa Hamilton is still the solution.

275
00:22:52,817 --> 00:22:54,377
As in the dead Vanessa Hamilton?

276
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,491
Remember what she said about 'The Chemist'?

277
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,819
He likes the boys from back home in Brazil.

278
00:22:58,865 --> 00:23:00,823
She supplied him with boys.

279
00:23:00,866 --> 00:23:02,746
So maybe there's still one out there.

280
00:23:02,788 --> 00:23:04,462
We need to go back through her files.

281
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,865
And the Czyrko ones as well.

282
00:23:07,193 --> 00:23:09,232
One of those boys knows where he is.

283
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:21,044
OK, we need to go through
absolutely every detail

284
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:22,844
on Vanessa Hamilton's record.

285
00:23:22,892 --> 00:23:24,372
What are we looking for?

286
00:23:24,413 --> 00:23:26,884
Brazilian rent boys.
What?

287
00:23:26,935 --> 00:23:30,568
Yeah. Check out all the girls
on Vanessa's books as well.

288
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:32,339
Find out if they can help us.
Oh, yes.

289
00:23:32,382 --> 00:23:34,693
We'll take care of that part, right?

290
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:40,788
Be good, BB. Come on.

291
00:23:40,832 --> 00:23:43,587
We'll check out the Czyrko file.

292
00:23:55,488 --> 00:23:58,961
Does Louise ever, er...say anything about me?

293
00:23:59,011 --> 00:24:01,813
You really wanna know that?

294
00:24:04,018 --> 00:24:07,491
I like her a lot, just something
happens whenever she's around.

295
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:10,057
I can't help pushing the
gobby asshole button.

296
00:24:10,265 --> 00:24:13,259
Hey, take your mind off it.

297
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:18,029
She's got...I dunno. She's got style.

298
00:24:18,073 --> 00:24:21,625
The way she stands all cool and
French in that Mac.

299
00:24:21,676 --> 00:24:24,593
Yeah, yeah. You got to just be yourself, man.

300
00:24:24,641 --> 00:24:25,994
That's all.

301
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:29,196
I know. I actually think that's
a big part of the problem.

302
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:35,730
Thiago? That's a Brazilian name, right?

303
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:39,930
Stefan Czyrko mentions three Brazilians in his reports.

304
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:44,977
Thiago. Takes part in videos of
gang rape and torture of twinks.

305
00:24:45,022 --> 00:24:47,539
Of what, sorry?
Twinks.

306
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,067
Young men that look like boys.

307
00:24:49,107 --> 00:24:50,906
Very popular with English ruling class.

308
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,384
I don't know about "look", boss.

309
00:24:52,432 --> 00:24:55,028
Them establishment nonces
usually go for the real deal.

310
00:24:55,075 --> 00:24:57,950
Start tracing the number and go find him.

311
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,881
Your wish is my command.

312
00:25:01,842 --> 00:25:04,803
Does it work any better for you in French, cupcake?

313
00:25:10,731 --> 00:25:12,644
I'm going home.

314
00:25:13,214 --> 00:25:16,050
Won't you stay at our place, Elise?
Your place is a tip.

315
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,738
No. Thanks.

316
00:25:18,381 --> 00:25:19,815
Elise...

317
00:25:19,862 --> 00:25:21,582
I didn't care what Gael was feeling.

318
00:25:21,624 --> 00:25:23,856
I don't see why it would be
any different for me now.

319
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,546
Brian! No, you knocked our tower over.

320
00:25:30,594 --> 00:25:32,075
He broke it!

321
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:34,586
He broke the tower, didn't he, naughty Brian?

322
00:25:34,638 --> 00:25:36,836
Shall we make it really big?

323
00:25:36,881 --> 00:25:39,034
I'll get it.
Are you getting the ball?

324
00:25:39,084 --> 00:25:41,394
Got it.
Brian's ball.

325
00:25:41,445 --> 00:25:43,679
Well, they're all right, aren't they?

326
00:25:43,729 --> 00:25:45,561
Karl.
Yeah?

327
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:47,968
Sorry, darling. Can I just...

328
00:25:49,055 --> 00:25:51,365
You know that time when the hot water went

329
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:54,173
and the guys came to fix it and
they said to check the flues?

330
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,179
And you said?
I'd look into it.

331
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:57,816
Yeah.
Yeah.

332
00:25:57,864 --> 00:26:01,337
You know the secret of a really
good intelligence operation?

333
00:26:01,387 --> 00:26:05,590
The fact that you don't know is
actually the objective.

334
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:07,353
It's too random.

335
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:10,438
If...if they wanted to kill us,

336
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:12,596
they would have made the leak more lethal.

337
00:26:12,641 --> 00:26:15,477
If they just wanted to warn us,
it wasn't controllable enough.

338
00:26:15,523 --> 00:26:17,801
They couldn't have known
Brian would save the day.

339
00:26:17,846 --> 00:26:19,839
Good old Brian.

340
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,646
Call me naive...
You're naive.

341
00:26:23,772 --> 00:26:26,289
But I think it was a...
faulty boiler and a blocked flue.

342
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:28,089
And we're alive.

343
00:26:28,137 --> 00:26:31,019
And I'm gonna go online and
getting a carbon monoxide alarm.

344
00:26:33,703 --> 00:26:35,823
Gonna get dinner started.
OK.

345
00:26:50,403 --> 00:26:52,123
Ssh.

346
00:26:52,164 --> 00:26:54,477
Ssh. I removed it.

347
00:26:54,528 --> 00:26:56,248
A gun really isn't what you want.

348
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:57,883
I want to die.
No!

349
00:26:57,931 --> 00:27:01,244
No, no, no, no.
We're the survivors, remember?

350
00:27:03,657 --> 00:27:05,092
It wasn't true.

351
00:27:07,701 --> 00:27:10,094
That I have no feelings for you.

352
00:27:10,945 --> 00:27:13,222
It wasn't true.
You're a spy.

353
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:16,666
Do you know the phrase, "Maskirovka"?

354
00:27:17,712 --> 00:27:20,434
It means guile and deception.

355
00:27:20,916 --> 00:27:23,877
Soldiers in uniforms without insignia.

356
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,640
Many battles are won that way.

357
00:27:25,682 --> 00:27:27,835
You're not a soldier, you're a liar and coward.

358
00:27:30,007 --> 00:27:31,839
I've had better sex with you.

359
00:27:31,888 --> 00:27:33,961
Now look who's the liar here.

360
00:27:35,292 --> 00:27:38,367
This isn't "Maskirovka", it's just me.

361
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:46,538
You taste like gin.

362
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:01,957
One more night?
No.

363
00:28:02,163 --> 00:28:03,438
One more night?

364
00:28:03,483 --> 00:28:04,838
Yes.

365
00:28:05,487 --> 00:28:07,319
One more night.

366
00:28:47,614 --> 00:28:49,413
Don't fucking run.

367
00:28:49,455 --> 00:28:52,894
Don't run. I was the fastest kid
in my class, so I'll catch you.

368
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,181
For fuck's sake!

369
00:28:57,664 --> 00:28:59,259
So I imagine work's dried up a bit

370
00:28:59,307 --> 00:29:02,859
since Vanessa Hamilton went to
the humidor in the sky, Thiago?

371
00:29:02,911 --> 00:29:05,028
Edgar Branco.
Where can we find him?

372
00:29:09,198 --> 00:29:12,317
I know a man. Let's call him Mr.Gray
because that's his name.

373
00:29:12,361 --> 00:29:13,761
He can fix stuff.

374
00:29:13,803 --> 00:29:16,193
He can certainly organize
a trip back to your "Favela"

375
00:29:16,244 --> 00:29:18,807
with a couple of those nice men from
G4 sitting next to you.

376
00:29:18,847 --> 00:29:21,080
Fuck you. I'm legal.

377
00:29:21,131 --> 00:29:23,728
I don't think that detail would
bother Mr.Gray too much.

378
00:29:25,776 --> 00:29:27,529
Where did you meet him?

379
00:29:27,577 --> 00:29:30,413
She took me to his place in a car,
and when I left,

380
00:29:30,461 --> 00:29:33,297
she had to give me six Bennies
to bring my heart rate down.

381
00:29:33,345 --> 00:29:35,941
He gave you drugs?
Oh, man.

382
00:29:36,147 --> 00:29:38,380
He shot me up with stuff,
you would not believe.

383
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,583
Oh, I might. What do you remember?

384
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:47,711
In the corridor outside his flat
there was a...a plant. Spiky.

385
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,036
Where?

386
00:29:49,082 --> 00:29:51,153
I promise you, blondie, I don't remember.

387
00:29:51,203 --> 00:29:53,596
A block of flats. Ugly.

388
00:29:53,646 --> 00:29:56,323
The flat was on the fourth floor.
It's my lucky number.

389
00:29:56,369 --> 00:29:57,805
What else do you remember?

390
00:29:59,012 --> 00:30:00,811
About the area.

391
00:30:00,855 --> 00:30:02,653
There was, erm...

392
00:30:02,978 --> 00:30:05,814
a tattoo shop, on the corner of the street.

393
00:30:06,662 --> 00:30:09,781
I remember seeing it but
I don't remember its name.

394
00:30:09,825 --> 00:30:11,657
Think.

395
00:30:12,587 --> 00:30:14,342
It had, erm...

396
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,863
it had pictures of birds on it.

397
00:30:16,913 --> 00:30:19,030
Small ones, like, er...

398
00:30:20,076 --> 00:30:21,635
Andorinha?

399
00:30:30,367 --> 00:30:32,838
I saw Eryka Klein last night.

400
00:30:32,891 --> 00:30:34,290
She came to my flat.

401
00:30:38,257 --> 00:30:40,250
She stayed the night with me again.

402
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:45,375
I don't know who I am any more.

403
00:30:48,587 --> 00:30:49,942
I'm gonna tell Olivier.

404
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,788
No, don't do that.

405
00:30:53,314 --> 00:30:56,275
I betrayed my profession,
my colleagues, our investigation.

406
00:30:56,317 --> 00:30:58,115
Your gender.

407
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,159
I'm kidding.

408
00:31:02,963 --> 00:31:04,843
Elise...you're in love.

409
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:08,486
You being you, there are no half measures.

410
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,886
Still trust me?

411
00:31:11,933 --> 00:31:13,767
Oh, come on.

412
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,776
Nothing will ever change
your irritating pedantry

413
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,256
or your photographic memory,

414
00:31:19,303 --> 00:31:21,898
or the fact that you're an embarrassment
in a witness interview,

415
00:31:21,945 --> 00:31:25,224
especially with small, frightened children, but...

416
00:31:27,592 --> 00:31:28,912
Come on.

417
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,746
Of course I still trust you.

418
00:31:31,796 --> 00:31:33,789
God help us.

419
00:31:38,042 --> 00:31:41,482
Thank you.
You're very welcome.

420
00:31:45,932 --> 00:31:47,924
You're my best friend.

421
00:31:53,421 --> 00:31:55,413
Look.

422
00:31:56,503 --> 00:31:58,177
Andorinhas.

423
00:31:58,226 --> 00:32:00,105
Swallows.

424
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,515
Is that ugly?

425
00:32:13,563 --> 00:32:16,682
I don't know anything about architecture.

426
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,048
Shall we call back-up?

427
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,374
Let's just take a look.

428
00:32:52,886 --> 00:32:54,880
Karl.

429
00:32:58,732 --> 00:33:01,125
Call back-up.

430
00:33:18,234 --> 00:33:20,432
Get your fucking hands off her, you...

431
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:01,753
Hmm.

432
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:09,250
Pretty eyes.
Thanks.

433
00:34:10,612 --> 00:34:12,172
Oh...

434
00:34:12,215 --> 00:34:15,016
I remember a prisoner once with eyes like hers.

435
00:34:15,057 --> 00:34:18,577
Actually, it was the first time
I successfully removed a retina

436
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:21,297
from the eyeball of a conscious person.

437
00:34:21,344 --> 00:34:23,418
What a great day.

438
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:29,070
You may call Koba.

439
00:34:32,757 --> 00:34:36,550
The bastards killed my father, so kill them.

440
00:34:36,601 --> 00:34:38,400
Kill them now.

441
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,358
The male cop first.

442
00:34:40,407 --> 00:34:43,402
Put a bullet right up his ass,

443
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:46,092
and leave the phone on so I can hear.

444
00:34:46,132 --> 00:34:48,969
Don't spend too much time
fooling about with the girl

445
00:34:49,016 --> 00:34:51,452
before you kill her either.

446
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:03,672
Wait! Me first! Take me first!

447
00:35:04,673 --> 00:35:06,027
Wait! Wait! Wait!

448
00:35:06,074 --> 00:35:09,275
Excuse me? Hand me the phone, please, sir? Thanks.

449
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,673
Are you sure you want to do it this way?

450
00:35:26,697 --> 00:35:29,818
Karl? It's me, let me know
when you're getting home.

451
00:35:29,862 --> 00:35:31,855
I've bought sea bass.

452
00:35:39,632 --> 00:35:41,306
Mister...

453
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:43,153
You can go.

454
00:35:51,806 --> 00:35:54,927
Yes, it will take you approximately...

455
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:58,123
let's say...three days to die.

456
00:35:58,172 --> 00:36:01,213
Then your bodies will start to decompose...

457
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:03,331
releasing fluids.

458
00:36:04,659 --> 00:36:08,418
Then eventually the neighbors
will smell you, of course,

459
00:36:08,465 --> 00:36:11,425
and call the emergency services.

460
00:36:12,748 --> 00:36:15,346
Who will, in their turn,
become infected themselves.

461
00:36:15,391 --> 00:36:17,224
You understand?

462
00:36:18,074 --> 00:36:20,307
So, that's how it will go.

463
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:23,239
In fact, you will be the little fire
in the baker's shop...

464
00:36:23,922 --> 00:36:25,914
that burns the whole city down.

465
00:36:26,445 --> 00:36:28,039
See?

466
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:30,000
Now, if you will excuse me.

467
00:36:30,048 --> 00:36:32,326
A few minutes. A little preparation.

468
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:56,748
Is the chopper here?

469
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,918
Close.

470
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,681
Good.

471
00:37:01,523 --> 00:37:03,880
I've left them a goodbye present.

472
00:37:07,409 --> 00:37:09,880
Two cops nearly fucked everything up

473
00:37:09,932 --> 00:37:11,925
by finding 'The Chemist'.

474
00:37:12,936 --> 00:37:16,295
No worry. We've got them safe and sound.

475
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,221
Which cops?

476
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,498
The English guy and the French girl

477
00:37:21,545 --> 00:37:23,664
who were snooping after you at the start.

478
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:27,501
Luckily we found them before
they could call reinforcements.

479
00:37:28,514 --> 00:37:30,585
Are...are they still alive?

480
00:37:31,396 --> 00:37:32,751
Just.

481
00:37:32,798 --> 00:37:35,760
I told them not to spend too much time
fooling about with her

482
00:37:35,802 --> 00:37:37,715
before they kill her.

483
00:37:37,764 --> 00:37:39,757
I just hope they listen.

484
00:37:40,367 --> 00:37:42,405
'The Chemist' will let them die slowly

485
00:37:42,449 --> 00:37:45,762
and make them into a toxic booby trap.

486
00:37:45,813 --> 00:37:47,532
That's quite a leaving gift.

487
00:37:47,574 --> 00:37:51,048
It's for my father. He does not go unavenged.

488
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,771
It wasn't an airborne virus, right?

489
00:37:56,224 --> 00:37:58,057
No.

490
00:37:58,867 --> 00:38:01,543
But it will close down that
shitty little island

491
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,070
for a few years.

492
00:38:05,635 --> 00:38:08,231
Helicopter's on its way.

493
00:38:08,518 --> 00:38:10,398
We head out in 20 minutes.

494
00:38:13,204 --> 00:38:15,719
I need to go to the bathroom.

495
00:38:39,313 --> 00:38:43,389
If you're having a shower,
then hurry the fuck up.

496
00:38:54,018 --> 00:38:56,369
.
.
.
Patch me to control center immediately.

497
00:39:00,416 --> 00:39:03,012
We've got a dog. Did I tell you that?

498
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:07,175
No.

499
00:39:09,907 --> 00:39:11,581
What is it called?

500
00:39:11,628 --> 00:39:13,349
What? What is it called?

501
00:39:13,391 --> 00:39:14,905
The dog?
Yeah.

502
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,545
Well, you know, er...

503
00:39:19,717 --> 00:39:21,231
you know the three-headed dog

504
00:39:21,278 --> 00:39:24,275
that guards the Gates of Hades?
Cerberus?

505
00:39:24,842 --> 00:39:26,722
Yeah.
Not that.

506
00:39:27,045 --> 00:39:28,606
Brian.

507
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,961
Oh.

508
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,501
We came close to getting them.

509
00:39:43,344 --> 00:39:45,063
Yeah.

510
00:39:45,626 --> 00:39:47,619
Close but no cheroot.

511
00:39:51,393 --> 00:39:53,271
Well, we found cheroots.

512
00:39:53,315 --> 00:39:56,230
What?
We found cheroots.

513
00:39:58,201 --> 00:39:59,601
What?

514
00:39:59,641 --> 00:40:01,362
We found cheroots.

515
00:40:03,527 --> 00:40:07,000
It's a phrase.
"Close but no cigar."

516
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:10,284
It's when you nearly succeed,

517
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:11,815
but you don't quite make it.

518
00:40:11,856 --> 00:40:14,737
You say, "Close but no cigar."
I said, "Close but no cheroot."

519
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,545
That was a joke, wasn't it?
No...

520
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:26,108
Elise...

521
00:40:27,313 --> 00:40:29,829
it's not funny.

522
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:45,927
Is it...not funny?
No, it's not funny.

523
00:40:46,655 --> 00:40:48,773
So, why do you laugh, then?

524
00:40:48,817 --> 00:40:50,889
I don't know.

525
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:55,021
You have to laugh, don't you?
No time for weeping.

526
00:40:59,228 --> 00:41:01,905
That's for all the kids you
tortured in Colonia Dignidad,

527
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,023
you fucking inhuman Nazi.

528
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:13,201
Mr.Max?

529
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:57,010
Elise?

530
00:41:57,813 --> 00:41:59,373
Elise?

531
00:42:01,056 --> 00:42:03,414
No, no, don't worry.

532
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,338
Just...

533
00:42:05,862 --> 00:42:07,900
Elise?
Sorry, can you...

534
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:09,460
hold her head back?

535
00:42:09,507 --> 00:42:11,864
Elise!

536
00:42:13,391 --> 00:42:14,791
Don't worry. Hold still.

537
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:16,711
Elise! Help!
No worries.

538
00:42:16,755 --> 00:42:19,715
Aagh!
So, this is going to sting...

539
00:42:19,757 --> 00:42:21,751
Get your fucking hands off her!
Elise!

540
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,556
Murder!

541
00:42:27,927 --> 00:42:29,646
Aagh!

542
00:42:30,891 --> 00:42:32,769
Elise!

543
00:42:34,454 --> 00:42:35,684
Elise!

544
00:42:42,784 --> 00:42:44,663
So...

545
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,065
Elise?

546
00:42:51,434 --> 00:42:53,313
You want to see her?

547
00:42:53,356 --> 00:42:55,188
Fuck off.

548
00:42:59,603 --> 00:43:02,757
She has just fainted from the shock. See?

549
00:43:03,527 --> 00:43:07,126
More conventional approach for you, I presume?
Or the same?

550
00:43:09,614 --> 00:43:10,809
Armed police!

551
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:12,085
Drop your weapons!

552
00:43:12,737 --> 00:43:14,809
Do not move!

553
00:43:15,981 --> 00:43:19,056
Get her to the hospital!
He has injected her in the fucking eye!

554
00:43:19,905 --> 00:43:21,260
Get her out of here quickly!

555
00:43:21,306 --> 00:43:24,188
She's contagious,
she's been injected in the eye. Move!

556
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,230
Stay on the floor, Mr.Branco.

557
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:30,344
Don't worry. I'm not in the habit of
executing people in cold blood.

558
00:43:30,757 --> 00:43:32,670
Aaargh!

559
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:36,956
Unless it's a clause in a very tricky
last-minute deal with the Russians.

560
00:43:37,003 --> 00:43:38,438
Photographs and DNA.

561
00:43:38,485 --> 00:43:41,766
They want full evidence that
he has been decommissioned.

562
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:43,684
I gotta get to the hospital.

563
00:43:43,731 --> 00:43:45,166
Come with me.

564
00:43:45,213 --> 00:43:47,809
They'll do everything they can for her.

565
00:43:47,856 --> 00:43:51,010
And unless you're a virologist,
you'll just get in the way.

566
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:54,420
Besides, we've got an
appointment with Artem Baturin.

567
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,994
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

568
00:44:12,684 --> 00:44:14,244
Can you hear me?

569
00:44:51,567 --> 00:44:54,483
Artem Baturin, I'm arresting you

570
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:59,211
for offenses against the Terrorism Act of 2006.

571
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:26,887
.
.
.
.
Control here. Has the Operation finished?

572
00:45:28,175 --> 00:45:30,820
.
.
Affirmative, control. It's over.

573
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:36,686
ONE WEEK LATER
_

574
00:45:49,311 --> 00:45:50,746
How is it?

575
00:45:53,956 --> 00:45:57,077
It's a bit strange...looking out of one eye.

576
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,242
I thought you'd been doing that all your life.

577
00:46:01,965 --> 00:46:04,038
I got another blood transfusion today.

578
00:46:04,088 --> 00:46:05,443
Yeah, I know.

579
00:46:05,489 --> 00:46:08,530
You might have got some of my blood.
We're the same type.

580
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:11,206
They think they might have
flushed the virus out.

581
00:46:11,255 --> 00:46:13,409
They got it so early.
Good.

582
00:46:17,023 --> 00:46:19,255
What's happening to Artem Baturin?

583
00:46:19,304 --> 00:46:21,947
They're trying to find
a place to hold the trial.

584
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,820
Trying to keep the core of it secret.

585
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:29,429
And the plane?

586
00:46:30,757 --> 00:46:32,157
Won't ever come out.

587
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,072
Might let the stuff about
Robert Fournier and Defense

588
00:46:35,123 --> 00:46:37,081
into the public domain, but that's it.

589
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:39,402
Nobody will know who took the plane down?

590
00:46:39,447 --> 00:46:41,168
Nope.

591
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:44,043
And that doesn't bother you?

592
00:46:44,733 --> 00:46:48,092
Well, he's on trial.
He'll spend the rest of his life in prison.

593
00:46:49,259 --> 00:46:50,739
Nothing's ever perfect, is it?

594
00:46:52,621 --> 00:46:55,092
Gotta know when to stop, I guess.

595
00:46:55,144 --> 00:46:57,786
That's almost exactly
what she said to me once.

596
00:46:58,548 --> 00:46:59,949
Have you heard from her again?

597
00:47:01,512 --> 00:47:03,152
No.

598
00:47:05,876 --> 00:47:09,077
She saved your life, Elise.
It was quite a leaving present.

599
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:20,128
Hey, you'll get better.

600
00:47:23,936 --> 00:47:25,690
You don't need to find
your long-lost twin.

601
00:47:25,739 --> 00:47:28,494
You're an exceptional person
in your own right.

602
00:47:31,025 --> 00:47:33,143
You're you.

603
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,574
Good night, boss.
Good night.

604
00:48:05,623 --> 00:48:07,456
Good evening.

605
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:31,521
Hello. You've reached Laura and Karl.

606
00:48:31,572 --> 00:48:32,768
Please leave a message.

607
00:48:32,813 --> 00:48:34,771
Hi, it's me. I'm on my way home.

608
00:48:35,777 --> 00:48:38,054
Tell the kids they can stay up late, eh?

609
00:48:40,782 --> 00:48:42,775
I love you all.

610
00:48:54,518 --> 00:48:56,112
* A long time I have loved *

611
00:48:56,159 --> 00:48:58,356
* the sunned mother-of-pearl of your body *

612
00:48:58,882 --> 00:49:02,036
* Until I even believe that *
* you own the Universe *

613
00:49:02,367 --> 00:49:05,646
* I will bring you happy *
* flowers from the mountains *

614
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:11,454
* bluebells, dark hazels and *
* rustic baskets of kisses *

615
00:49:12,418 --> 00:49:13,898
* I want to do with you *

616
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:16,409
* what spring does with the cherry trees *

617
00:50:05,952 --> 00:50:07,963
(GRACIAS A LA VIDA BY MERCEDES SOSA)

618
00:50:08,054 --> 00:50:23,961
* Thanks to life, which has given me so much *
* HE gave me two stars, which when I open *

619
00:50:24,052 --> 00:50:38,577
* Perfectly distinguish black from white *
* The high sky in the starry background *

620
00:50:38,688 --> 00:50:45,496
* And the man I love in the crowds *
