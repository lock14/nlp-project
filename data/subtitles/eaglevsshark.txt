Lily, l brought you here today
to ask you a very special question.
What is it?

Same. But it feels really natural.
Yeah, same. l feel that too.

Yes. Yes, l will.
Awesome.
You have made me the happiest man

You guys can't come over here

They make these decisions.
Please not me. Please not me.
Sorry, Lily.
lt's OK.
OK, guys, let's get back to work.
Sorry, it's unlucky.
- You can finish up the week.
- Yeah.
The shark is often a solitary
animal. It's only social contact...
No, no. You've eaten already.
Winston's trying
to eat my fish and chips.
Cute.
...from a considerable distance
by the distressed or wounded.
You are apples
And I am tangerines
We're different fruit
From the same tree...
That sounds really cool.
- Here.
l got the idea when Winston
tried to eat my fish.
Thanks, Damon,
l like it a lot.
l'm really sorry you lost your job.
They don't know what they're missing.
And if Mum and Dad were alive
they'd say the same thing.
Thanks, Damon.
Well, it's true.
Good night, sis.
Good night.
l'm Lily McKinnon. Welcome to Meaty
Boy. What would you like to eat today?
A Big Boy Burger Meal, l bet.
Yes, a Big Boy Burger Meal, please.
OK.
Do you want the big fries?

The big size, free, you'll save $1 .50.
- Free.
- OK.
Do you want cheese on your burger?
No thanks.

Yeah, l know that.
Here you go.
Hey, do you know that chick Jenny?
Yeah, she's my best friend.
Would you be able to give her this?
lt's an invitation to my party.
Oh, cool.
lt's gonna be cool. You
get to dress as your favorite animal.
And there's gonna be games.
My friend has a helmet and he's
gonna let us chuck shoes at his head.
Oh, cool.
- Yeah, so thanks for the fries.
- Bye.
Jenny, a guy came in today
with this invitation
to give to you, it's for a party,
for an animal party.
An Animal party.
Dress as your favorite animal.
lt's gonna be really cool.
Do you think there's any potential way
that l could come with you?
Oh, yeah, cool, that sounds really cool.
Dick.
Cool costumes.
- Thanks.
- l'm Duncan.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Can you guess what l am?
- Snake?
- Yes.
Hey, Jarrod.
This is Jarrod. He's my flatmate.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Who are you guys?
- l'm Lily.
- She gave you free fries.
- Damon.
- Oh, yeah. l got some free fries.
- Cool.
- Oh, yeah, l told you, huh?
Yeah, you told me.
Where's that chick Jenny?
Why isn't she here?
She's a lesbian.
She went to a lesbian party.
- Typical.
- Awesome.
Oh, well, it was getting
too crowded here anyway.
l like your costume.
Thanks.
lt's pretty much
the second best outfit here.
So your favorite animal's a shark?
- Yup.
- Pretty cool.
l almost came as a shark, but l realized
that an eagle's slightly better.
- What are you supposed to be?
- Tarantula.
- lt's 7:00, Jarrod.
- OK, let's do this thing.
- What's happening?
- The Fight Man competition. Come on.
- Cool.
- lt's neat.
A knockout tournament.
The finalist gets to fight Jarrod.
You probably won't win.
He's the undefeated champion.
- You're competing?
- Yup.
- You?
- Oh, no, l'm just a spectator.
What's your combat name?
What?
You know, your combat name
for when you're competing.
Jarrod, he's the Eagle Lord
and l'm Blaze.
Mine's the Dangerous Person.
OK.
Fight Man!
Hi, everyone.
Welcome to the second annual...
...third annual Fight Man competition.
First up, we have Valkyrieblood
and the lce Elf Queen.
Let's fight, man.
- Fight!
- Victory!
Tony, bro', you're up.
Fight!
- Destroy him.
- Victory!
Next up is Dangerous Person.
Choose your destiny.
Who are you?
Fight!
- Destroy her.
Outstanding.
That girl sure knows
how to play her video games.
She's all right.
Victory!
Amazing.
Primo. Fantastic.
- Flawless victory.
- Fuck!
- Good stuff.
- You're good.
OK, so that's the end of the list.
And we're into the finals now.
And Dangerous Person will
take on last year's champion,
and the year
before that's champion, Eagle Lord.
Gidday.
Fight!
Nice. But no cigar.
- Kill her.
Victory!
- You win.
- Yeah.
lt's time for my game.
lmpressive fighting, Dangerous Person.
- Thanks.
- Where'd you learn to play like that?
l don't know.
l guess l just got into it.
Hmm.
You had some pretty cool moves for
someone who'd never played before.
Takes more than cool moves
to defeat a champion.
Don't forget that.
Ow, ow.
This is a plane l made.
Cool.
Guitar, emery board, fret board.
Painted eggs.
Jewelry.
Watch wallet.
Wow.
This is the area
where l make my candles.
Flame within a flame. Conceptual.
Giant pencil.
Ancient coin.
Probably sell these to the Muslims.
Sell this one to the Yanks. Make a mint.
Cool.
l guess l've gotta keep creating
or l'll just die.
Wow.
So who's that Tarantula guy.
ls that your boyfriend?
Oh, no. He's my brother.
He's a cartoonist. And he's
very good at accents and impressions.
My brother's dead.
Oh, l'm sorry.
My parents are dead too.
Yeah, well...
...my mum's dead as well.
How did your parents die?
- Heart attacks.
- Were they too fat?
Oh, no. My dad died when he was 72,
and then my mum died
because she really missed him.
Yeah, well...
...my mum got kicked
in the head by a cow.
Can't go near cows now
because of that,
because l think about her too much.
l'm so sorry about your mum.
- And your brother.
- lt's cool.
You're pretty beautiful.
Same. l mean, you are too...
sort of, more handsome.
- Do you wanna kiss?
- Yep.
On the lips, though.
- Yep.
- OK.
Wanna have a lie-down on my bed?
- Yep.
- OK.
Do you wanna have sex?
Um, yep.
Fuck.
Sorry.
Hello?
Hello, is Eric there please?
Who's speaking?
The police.
Hello?
You're fuckin' dead,
you fuckin' Samoan fuck.
Who is this?
Stop...
Oh, hi.
What are you doing here?
l just had a sandwich
and l was, you know, nearby.
That was pretty good sex last night.
OK, well. l'm going back to work.
OK, bye.
- See ya.
- See ya.
Uh, what are you up to tonight?
- l don't know.
- l might go to a movie. You can come.
lt's the new Wolverine movie.
lt's got Hugh Jackman in it.
Apparently, l look like him.
Gets pretty tiresome.
''Hey, Jarrod,
you look like Wolverine.''
Sometimes l wish l did have knives
that came out of my fists.
Anyway, it's 7:30 at Cine-saurus Rex.
- lf you want to come. l don't care.
- Yep.
Do you? OK. OK. See ya.
- See ya. Jarrod?
- Yeah?
- Eagle, eh?
- What?
Your favorite animal? Eagle?
Yeah, or cobra.
But, yeah, pretty much eagle rules.
- OK. See ya.
- See ya.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Yeah, so l didn't end up
going to that movie. Did you?
Yep, oh, no.
l knew it.
How did you find out where l live?
l got my flatmate to ring up your work.
Tell them it was an emergency.
You probably shouldn't go in there.
They think you're dead.
Yeah. l had to be alone.
l got depressed about something.
l suffer from depression.
Fifty. Break.
Yeah, that makes me pretty intense.
l just do stuff without thinking.
What's wrong?
l need to go home. To my hometown.
- Oh, that sounds cool.
- No.
lt's not cool. lt's necessary.
Why?
Because of my mission.
lt's time to put my training into use.
What do you have to do?
Kill a man... Probably.
- Who?
- Eric Elisi. He's Samoan.
Why? What did he do?
Nearly ruined my life, that's all.
He's my high school nemesis.
He's been living in Samoa,
but l just heard from my contact
that he's gonna be home soon.
When he gets back, guess who's
gonna be forming the welcoming party?
- You?
- You got it, girl.
What exactly are you gonna do to him?
l'm gonna kick his Samoan ass,
that's what.
lt's time to pay the piper.
He's gonna reap what he sowed,
and it sure ain't corn... or wheat.
When are you going?
That's the fucking point. l can't leave!
Sorry. l told you, l just
snap sometimes. lt's my depression.
Sorry.
Why can't you leave?
Don't have any wheels. How the hell am l
gonna get there if l got no wheels?
On a bus?
l'm not gonna take a damn bus.
lt'll take ages.
l'll get there in, like, two weeks.
Why don't you hire a car?
OK. Sure. Have you got,
like, a million dollars for me?
- What about Damon?
- Who?
My brother.
Oh, yeah, sorry.
He's got a car. He's got a Ford Laser.
Shall l ask him?
Yeah.
Damon, would it be all right
if we borrowed your car
to take Jarrod to his hometown?
Yes.
- He said yes.
- l heard.
Thanks, man. You're cool.
- Horse.
- Damn.
- l've got 1 4, you've only got eight.
- You're too good.
How many have you got?
None.
- Horse.
- Damn.
Look, l don't even get it.
Just whenever you see a horse,
you say ''horse,''
and whoever, in the end,
has the most horses wins all the horses.
Well, no. Not so much, really,
just like pretend.
Yeah, well,
it's not even a real game.
l don't really want to play this game
anymore, Damon. lt's dumb.
Hey, so...
What did the Samoan guy do to you?
Damon, that might be personal.
lt's cool.
Him and some other guys
from school used to gang up on me.
l used to be a bit of a nerd.
Would've been OK one on one.
Even one on two, me against two of them.
But l'd usually have to fight,
like, eight of them.
That's awful.
Sometimes my brother would help out,
and then we'd kick some serious ass.
But usually they'd find me when
l was alone, and l'm like, ''Oh, OK,
now l have to fight eight of you.
Come on then, bring it on.''
Anyway, l don't really
want to talk about it.
Jarrod...
...get out of the car.
l need your clothes
and your boots and your motorcycle.
- Know who that is?
- [chuckles] Arnie.
- lt's Arnie.
- He sounds just like him.
Hey, l bought some apples for you guys.
Thanks. l'll have one later.
Oh, yuk.
This is rotten.
Thanks very much for
trying to kill me, Damon.
So are you gonna introduce us?
- This is Nancy, my sister.
- Hi.
- This is Doug, her husband.
- Hi.
This is Dad. He's my Dad.
- This is my friend, Damon.
- Hello.
And this is Lily.
Lily's, like, the best female
Fight Man player l have ever seen.
- And she's a dancer.
- Cool.
No, l'm not.
l thought you said that once.
l like your jackets and your pants.
Thanks. This is our own label,
Awesome Apparel.
- lt didn't really take off.
- Which makes these quite rare.
- Really?
- You wouldn't find these in any shops.
We've actually got surplus stock
if you guys are keen to buy anything.
Oh, yeah?
- Are you keen?
- l am.
Yeah?
- Dad.
l made you this.
Thanks, Jarrod.
Where are you guys gonna sleep?
There's no room.
- What about my room?
- Our stock's in there.
- Gordon's room?
- Dad's in there.
Who's in his room?
Us.
- Who's in your room?
- Zane.
- Vinny's in here.
- Where am l supposed to sleep?
Pitch the tent.
l don't want to sleep
in a damn tent. This is typical.
- No one ever thinks about me.
- 'Cause you're a loser.
You're a loser. Bitch.
- Cock hole.
- Bitch.
- Cock hole.
- Bitch.
- Cock hole. Cock hole.
- Bitch.
Stop calling me cock hole, bitch.
- Cock hole.
You're a bitch
and you're gonna die of diabetes.
- Twenty-eight years old.
Treat me like an adult, bitch.
Hey, wow. That's you.
What? Yes.
- That's so well done.
- lt's OK. My brother did it.
What's all that stuff?
- Stuff.
- More candles?
Yes. Rejects.
Ones that aren't good enough.
Hey, wow. lt's a hand.
And it's pointing up.
Give me that. Who gave you
permission to touch that?
No one. Sorry.
How'd you like it if l went to your
place, started touching everything?
Like your books and
your oven, or your computer.
How about l started messing around on
your computer and changed the settings.
Changed your bloody desktop picture?
l said l was sorry.
This candle was supposed to be for
my Dad, but he thought it was dumb.
- Well, l think it's cool.
- lt's a reject.
How did your brother die?
Sorry.
He was saving a kid
from a fire at the school.
- Wow.
- Wow.
[Damon] l'll be back in a week, right?
Yep.
You need anything,
you just give me a call, OK?
Yeah.
- Thanks, Damon.
- Oooh.
Yep.
Oh, wait.
- Safety grass.
- Safety grass.
- [Austrian accent] l'll be back.
- See you later, cock hole.
See ya. Love ya.
Done.
l like your family.
Doug and Nancy are very nice.
They're idiots.
Except for my Dad and me.
l like them.
Yeah, well. They're still idiots.
This is Mason Hutchinson.
He's the best computer hacker l know.
Gidday, Mason.
This is Lily McKinnon. She's the best
female Fight Man player l've ever seen.
Hi.
Down to business. Any developments?
When's the bastard getting back?
Not today, but the next day.
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.
Good work.
How did you find out
this information?
l asked his mum.
She lives in his house.
Good.
l'm glad he'll have someone to wipe his
ass when l turn him into a vegetable.
You've got pornography
on your computer screen.
Oh, Baby. Oh, Baby.
Oh, Baby. Oh, Baby.
lt's got a virus.
Lilies.
Go. Move.
Hi, Dad.
Hey, Zane. You still playing guitar?
Yep, yep.
Me and Zane are in a band.
- Wow.
- He does the music and l dance.
Cool. Lily plays guitar. She's really
good. She's good at finger picking.
- Really?
- No, not really.
- Just, sort of, teaching myself.
- And she's got a degree.
No l don't.
What do your parents do?
- They're dead, unfortunately.
- They're dead.
Good one, Nancy.
They had heart attacks.
Sorry, Lily.
- lt doesn't matter.
- She's an orphan.
Like Oliver Twist.
Well, l suppose l should
say a few words.
Why?
Now we're all here, l'd just
like to say that l'm really happy
that we're all together
under the same roof.
lt's always great to come home.
l'd also like to say
that this Saturday
l will be having a
scheduled fight with Eric Elisi.
- The Samoan.
- Oh, yeah. He used to beat you up.
- Yeah, and me.
- Yeah, and him.
He was the toughest guy at our school.
He used to pick on
quite a few people, actually.
Anyway, you're all invited to attend.
lt'd be great to see you there.
Thank you.
Why are you fighting him, Uncle?
Well, Zane, basically,
l'm gonna restore honor
to the family name, to your family name.
My family name is Davis. Eh, Dad?
Yep. Dangerous Davis, back in the day.
- Yeah, l'm a Davis too.
- Yeah, well it doesn't matter, does it?
We're family. That's what matters.
Why didn't you tell me
you had a little girl?
l don't know.
- How often do you see her?
- Not very.
- How old is she?
- Nine.
- Were you married?
- No. What is this Crimewatch?
We met at a party, we had sex, then
a baby came out. End of story. Finito.
How many boyfriends have you had?
- Three.
- Who?
Sam, Sam, another Sam and Raymond.
How many girlfriends have you had?
About five.
Actually eight. l forgot some.
- Who?
- That's irrelevant.
- Lily.
- Yep.
You can hold my hand
if you want.
OK.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Look at all this stuff.
How much do you reckon you'd pay...
...for all this makeup?
A bag, like this?
Dunno. Maybe a hundred bucks?
No. All this is only 30 dollars.
And it's dermatologically sweet as.
- Yep. But you can have it for 20.
- Cool.
Five.
Twenty-five dollars.
Because you're a guest.
Combination.
Kick, punch, block, spin, double kick.
Kick, spin, kick,
punch, double kick.
OK, ball. Block.
Stick, block. Block.
Hoop. Through, yes.
- Hi.
- Hey, Trace.
Hey, Trace-meister.

Their dead brother's fiance.
- Hey, this is Lily.
- Gidday.
Hi.
She's good at sports.
Netball, darts...
- Here, Jonah, here's that tape.
- Thank you.
Hey Trace-meister.

Naomi got run over in the weekend.
So they... yeah.
That's wonderful news.

Oh, thanks.

- Oh, no. l'm not really that good.
Yes, you are.
She is good. Show them.
Go on. They want to see it.
Why'd you drop it?
Sorry.
Dad, what do you think
of my new girlfriend?
She's an artist and a musician.
Amongst other things.
- She's pretty cool, eh?
- l don't know.
Yeah.
Hey, what's good to buy for girls?
- Socks.
- l don't know.
- Vitamins.
- Flowers, eh?
- Chicks like flowers.
- Yes.
What kind?
l don't mind.
Doesn't matter.
Chicks, they just like flowers.
Chilly.
l have to dump you.
OK.
My life's just too complicated.
l guess, what l'm saying is
l gotta be alone right now.
Oh, yeah.
And l'm busy with the revenge mission.
l'm sorry.
- l didn't know this would happen.
- Oh, it doesn't matter.
And we can still be friends, right?
Yep.
Damn it.
l'm too complex.

- No. He broke up with me.
- Did he?
Would... Do you wanna go out with me?
No thanks.
Yeah, well, l wasn't even serious.

- Oh, Lily just told a funny joke.
Yeah. Where have you been?
Just hanging out with Tracy. We've been

Like this, but about
ten times more laughing.
Wow. That's heaps.
Excuse me.
Thank you for that very lovely dinner.
Excuse me. Thank you.
Gordon. Gordon.
Gordon. Gordon.
Get out of it.
Dad, me and Tracy are going out.
Don't know how it happened,
but it's pretty serious.
Just thought you should know
the good news.
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. l'm asleep.
- Why don't you go sleep in the tent?
- l'm all right.
You go in the tent.
l'll... l'll sleep out here.
No, you go.
- You go. You're the lady.
- l can handle it.
l've got my sleeping bag. l'm good.
You don't complain
about anything, do you?
There's some people in the world
who don't even have sleeping bags.
There's a weird smell down there.
l don't like it.
Think it's probably
a dead hedgehog or something.
Disgusting.
lf you get cold you can
come sleep in my tent,
but please don't wake me up.
The last thing l need.
You seem to be getting on
pretty well with my family.
Told you, l like them.
Yeah, well. Don't get too close.
They'll turn on you, that's for sure.
What was that joke
you told them?
Just my favorite.
One of Damon's.
Can you tell it to me?
No.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
You sucker,
you better watch out. You fool.
Hey, fool. Hey, fool!
Sucker. You foolish, foolish sucker.

- Our fight.
Hold on. Hold on.
Alison! Is there any mail for me?
Yeah. There's something here.
It's a letter. Should I open it?
Yes. l'll call you back. lt's long.
Hello.
- Hi, it's Jarrod.
- Hey there, man.
- Did you read it?
- Yeah, look, man. I'm sorry...
- You will be sorry. You will be.
Meet me, 3pm,

- We're gonna have a fight.
- Now look, I...
No, you look and listen.
You better be on

And if you don't turn up,
everyone's gonna know you're a pussy.
- Because l'm gonna tell them, fool.
- All right. I'll be there.
- OK. Good.
- Yep. All right.
That's all. See you later.

Some chick in a Trans Am.
Reckless bitch.

Oh, yeah.
Dad, do you want to come with me?
We could hang out and train.
Lily and l are doing something.
OK, cool.
Well, l'll see you guys later then.
Have a good day.
Who does he think he is?
You were right to break up with him.
No, l didn't break up with him.
He broke up with me.
Oh, well, you would've. Given time.
Take me away from here.
- Where?
- Anywhere.
- Help me escape.
- OK. Where shall we go?
Where do you wanna go?
Home. Wanna go home.
Home's horrible.
You must wanna go somewhere else.
- Hm, dunno. Be Australia.
- No, not there.
My ex-wife lives there.
What? ls she alive?
Who cares about her? She's a lesbian.
OK, don't put the blade out.
- Whoa. Stop the press.
- Wow.
We've got a fashion model in the house.

potentially still come to that party?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
ls this sort of appropriate? l don't
really have any sort of party gears.
Lily! Lily! Lily!
Lily! Lily! Lily! Lily!
Did you have a nice time
fucking my friend Mason Hutchinson?
What?
You have a nice time
fucking my friend Mason Hutchinson?
Or did you do everyone
at the whole party?
l didn't do anyone.
Anyway, what do you care?
You've got Tracy.
We're not going out.
We haven't even kissed.
Could've if l wanted to,
but l've been too busy training.
Where did you sleep last night?
- ln the bushes.
- Great.
l'm up all night
wondering where the hell you are.
l thought you were dead.
Could've left me a note or something.
Easy, ''Dear Jarrod,
don't wait up all night long.
l'll be sleeping in the bushes.
Thank you.''
l didn't get any sleep last night.
lt's my big day.
What am l going to tell your brother?
Oh, yeah. Hi, Damon.
Your sister, Lily, oh, nah.
Oh, she went to a party and got killed.
Here's a bit of her leg,
that's all that's left.
You should be more careful next time.
l'm not gonna be there
to wait up for you.
- Gotta go.
- You ready for your fight?
- Yes.
l'm gonna cut his damn head off.
Not that you'll be there.
You'll probably be off having sex
with heaps of people.
l'll think about it.
Can you remind my dad to come?
Because he might forget.
- Hi, this is Michael Jackson.
- Damon, it's Lily.
Lily. l tried to call.
- How's it going down there?
- lt's been pretty weird.
You want to come home?
l can come and get you.
No, it's too far. l'll catch a bus.
You sure? l can leave right now.

Gordon jumped off that.
Look at it, sticking up there
like a bloody tombstone.
lt was so wonderful when he won.
l just wanted him to keep on
doing better, you know, to keep winning.
Maybe that's why he did it...
...because of me.
l'll never know now.
My whole life's a complete disaster.
You know,
life is full of hard bits, l think.
But in between the hard bits
are some really lovely bits.
l mean, Jarrod's a lovely bit.
- Jarrod?
- Yep.
- Jarrod?

Mason, why didn't you tell me?
- l did, kind of.

Yeah, on the phone before l came here.
You said, ''When l'm finished with him,
he won't be able to walk.''
- And l laughed.

But l've been training.

For all the things l did.
For picking on you at school.
