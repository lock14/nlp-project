<i>I have a dream</i>

2
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,812
<i>A song to sing</i>

3
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:09,110
<i>To help me cope</i>

4
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,321
<i>With anything</i>

5
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:19,328
<i>If you see the wonder</i>

6
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:24,000
<i>Of a fairy tale</i>

7
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,086
<i>You can take the future</i>

8
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,175
Even if you fail.

00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,141
Sam Carmichael.

10
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,726
Bill Anderson.

00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,522
Harry Bright.

00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,232


13
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,119
Gentlemen, I have to go.

14
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:03,080
Thank you very much. Take care.

15
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,833


16
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,380
Morning, Rodney.

17
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,317
Taxi!

18
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,652


19
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,822
JFK, please, as quick as you can.

20
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,032


21
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,552


22
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:58,636


23
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,932
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

24
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,851


25
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,022
I missed you. Oh, no...

26
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,524
-We're...
-We're...

27
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,651
Sophie, Ali, Lisa!
We're the greatest, bestest mates!

28
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,735
-I'm tough.
-I'm tall.

29
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,779
-I'm tiny.
-And we're gonna rock this place.

30
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:23,870
-Sophie, it's beautiful.
-I want one.

31
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,288
He did well, didn't he?

32
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,164
I'm getting married tomorrow.

33
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,457
I'm so glad you're here,

34
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:33,296
because I have a secret
and I can't tell anybody else.

35
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,300
-Sophie, you're knocked up?
-No! No! No!

36
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,636
I've invited my dad to my wedding.

37
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,388
You are joking!

38
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:46,225
-You found him at last?
-No! No, no, no, no, no, not exactly.

39
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:54,066
Okay. You know what my mom always said
when I asked about my father.

40
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,235
It was a summer romance,

41
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,572
and he'd gone long before she realized
that she was expecting me.

42
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,783
And I'd always kind of accepted that
that's all I'd ever know.

43
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:06,913
Well, I was ransacking some old trunks
and I found this.

44
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,375
It's the diary she kept
the year she was pregnant with me.

45
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,878
Sophie!

46
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:18,049
"July 17th. What a night!"

47
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,301
-I don't know if I want to hear this!
-I do!

48
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,929
"Sam rowed me over to the little island."

49
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,598
That's here. That's Kalokairi.

50
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:29,101
"We danced on the beach,
and we kissed on the beach,

51
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,979
"and dot, dot, dot."

52
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,064
What?

53
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:36,567
"Dot, dot, dot."
That's what they did in the olden days.

54
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,152
Stop it!

55
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,948
"Sam's the one. I know he is.

56
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,533
"I've never felt like this before."

57
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,285

<i>I've heard about him before</i>

63
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,180
<i>I wanted to know some more</i>

64
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,474
<i>And now I know what they mean</i>

65
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,560
<i>He's a love machine</i>

66
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,437
<i>Oh, he makes me dizzy</i>

67
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,818

<i>Let me feel it</i>

00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,319

00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:25,783
<i>Honey, honey</i>
<i>Don't conceal it</i>

70
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,243
<i>Honey, honey</i>

71
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,204
<i>The way that you kiss good night</i>

72
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,164
<i>The way that you kiss me good night</i>

73
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,666
<i>The way that you hold me tight</i>

74
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,584
<i>The way that you're holding me tight</i>

75
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,712
<i>I feel like I wanna sing</i>

76
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,798
<i>When you do your thing</i>

77
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:47,013
-So this guy Sam's your father!
-The plot thickens.

78
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,808
"All this time, Sam's been telling me
he loves me,

79
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,727
"and now he's announced
that he's engaged,

80
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,354
"so he's gone home to get married,

81
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,023
"and I'm never going to see him again."

82
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,357
Poor Donna.

83
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:02,361
"August 4th. What a night!

84
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:06,907
"Bill rented a motorboat,
and I took him over to the little island."

85
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,618
-Bill? Sophie, wait.
-Hang on.

86
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:13,789
"Though I'm still obsessed with Sam,

87
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,542
"Bill's so wild. He's such a funny guy.

00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,419
"One thing led to another,

"and dot, dot, dot."

"August 11th.
Harry turned up, out of the blue,

"He's so sweet and understanding,
I couldn't help it and

-Dot, dot, dot!

00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,977
-Oh, my God !
-Here come the bridesmaids.

96
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,563
Donna!

97
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,524
Look at you!

98
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:43,069
God! Stop growing!

99
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,240
-You sound like you're having fun already.
-Oh, we are.

100
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,950
I used to have fun.

101
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,452
Oh, we know!

<i>Honey, honey</i>
<i>Hold me, baby</i>

<i>Honey, honey</i>

106
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:11,514
<i>You look like a movie star</i>

107
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,101
<i>But I love just who you are</i>

108
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,269
<i>And, honey, to say the least</i>

109
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,897
<i>You're a doggone beast</i>

110
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,649


111
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,027
Bugger!

112
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,655
My sentiments exactly.

113
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,744
So, who is your dad?

114
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,830
-Sam, Bill or Harry?
-I don't know.

115
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,124
But which one did you invite?

116
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,128
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!

117
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,423
-Do they know?
-What would you write to a total stranger?

118
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,426
"Please come to my wedding,
you might be my father"? No.

119
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:53,097
They think that Mom sent the invites,
and with what's in here,

120
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,224
no surprise they said yes!

121
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,725


122
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:01,021

<i>Honey, honey</i>
<i>Nearly kill me</i>

125
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,363
<i>Honey, honey</i>

126
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:14,243
<i>I'd heard about you before</i>

127
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:19,123
<i>I wanted to know some more</i>

128
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,209
<i>And now I'm about to see</i>

129
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:27,131
<i>What you mean to me</i>

130
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,470
I'm trying to get to Kalokairi.
When's the next ferry?

131
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,265


132
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,850
-What?
-Monday.

133
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,937
-Bollocks!
-Yeah, my sentiments exactly.

134
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,066
Bride or groom?

135
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,528
Bride, although I've actually never met her.

136
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,155
Ahoy, there.

137
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,950
You guys need a ride to Kalokairi?

138
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:04,001
Excuse me, coming through.
I have a senior citizen with me. Thank you.

139
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,712
My mother needs a perch.

140
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,756
Mother? We're the same age.

141
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,800
Yeah. Well, parts of us are.

142
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:13,969


143
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,263
Sailor.

144
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,475
No.

145
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,852


146
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:23,854


147
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,152
Oh, he has your book!

148
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,821
Oh...

149
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,699
Stavros, Stavros.

150
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,201
Stavros.

151
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,836


152
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,172
It's just a fish.

153
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,300
You are so clever.

154
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,803
We're going to look fabulous tomorrow.

155
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:59,431
I want the perfect wedding,
and I want my father to give me away.

156
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,558
Better be a wide aisle.

157
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,478
I will know my father as soon as I see him.

158
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,399
Sky! Come here, gorgeous.

159
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,317
Put me down.
I'm getting married tomorrow.

160
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:11,735
Please be careful.

161
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,779
So?
There are pins in the dresses.

162
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,572
What do you think?

163
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,658
Oh, yes!

164
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,410
"Oh, yes." If you had your way,

165
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,288
it'd be a three-minute wedding
in jeans and T-shirts,

166
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,123
washed down with a bottle of beer.

167
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,417
You make me sound so unromantic!

168
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,377
I just thought we should save
our money for traveling.

169
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,296
Well, we're not going anywhere yet.

170
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,299
Anyway, please leave. We're very, very busy.

171
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,467
I'm just getting some props for tonight.

172
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,552
Ooh !

173
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,013
For his bachelor party.

174
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,518
Why haven't you told him
you've invited your dads?

175
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,854
Because he would say that
I'd have to tell my mom.

176
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,981
Donna's absolutely gonna kill you
when she finds out.

177
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,026
By the time she finds out, it'll be too late.

178
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,238
I feel like there's a part of me missing,

179
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,700
and when I meet my dad,

180
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:06,832
everything will fall into place.

181
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,797


182
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,008
More open !
I'm on it. I'm on it.

183
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,468
That's good.

184
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,679
That's it.

185
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,856
Come on, Cleopatra.

186
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,405


187
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,490
My shoe!

188
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,955
Will you look at what the tide washed in?

189
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,212
-For one night.
-And one night only.

190
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:59,218
-Donna and the Dynamos!
-Donna and the Dynamos!

191
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,969


192
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,144
Look at you!

193
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,480
-You baby!
-Look at you!

194
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,898
You look fantastic!

195
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,191
You look like an old hippie!

196
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,068
She looks fab.

197
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,404
These are new, though.
Where did you get these?

198
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,739
Husband number three!

199
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:24,326
-Dynamos! Dynamite!
-Dynamos! Dynamite!

200
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,286
Sleep all day and. . .

201
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,080
All night!

202
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,164


203
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,089
So, any men at this wedding?

204
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,633
Gorgeous Greeks of independent means?

205
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,970
Here we go! Husband number four!

206
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:46,849
-No! Not for me, for her!
-He's coming!

207
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,268
For her, now that her book is a bestseller,

208
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:52,938
and she's got the whole world
stuffing, what,

209
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:57,025
mushrooms? Various vegetables?

210
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,986
It's time to find Mr. Right!

211
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,114
Oh, please. Boring!

212
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,159
Great couple of role models
you two are for Sophie!

213
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:08,245
A serial bride and a little hermit over here!

214
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,748
That's me! I'm a lone wolf!

215
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,251


216
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,964
So, when are the lovebirds
flying the nest?

217
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,217
Oh, God! Who knows?

218
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:26,930
You know, I do not know what is going on
in that child's head sometimes.

219
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,600
She wants a big white wedding, and

220
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,644
she and Sky are making
all kinds of plans for the hotel.

221
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,813
Sometimes I think they'll never leave.

222
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,316
Yeah, but do you really want her to?

223
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,818
Well, I want what's best for her.

224
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,069
Of course not!

225
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,154


226
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,575
Sky! Come meet my backup girls.

227
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,535
Backup girls, my ass!
Backup girls, my ass!

228
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,496
He's the leading man at tomorrow's shindig.

229
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,164
-The lucky man.
-Hello.

230
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,791
-You must be Rosie.
-I am.

231
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,835
-How are you?
-Very well.

232
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,755
And you must be Tanya.

233
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:03,675
-I've heard so much about you.
-All bad, I hope.

234
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,219
-Yes.
-And all true.

235
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:06,595
Donna... Here, let me get them.

236
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,267
I know who you are.
You're Bill Anderson, aren't you?

237
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,981
<i>-Bloke in a Boat in Botswana.</i>
-Yes, I am.

238
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,193
You know, your books are a godsend
on dull business trips.

239
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,154
Now, I may look like I'm pondering
my securities, but in reality,

240
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:28,867
I'm trekking across
some remote corner of the planet.

241
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,911
You should try it for real sometime.

242
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,039
No, certainly, I'll never be
the spontaneous adventurer.

243
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:38,377
-You're a close friend of Donna's?
-No, I haven't heard from her for 20 years.

244
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:41,129
-Really?
-And then this invite, out of the blue.

245
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,965
You know, that's a coincidence,
neither had I.

246
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,592
-Going about!
-You got it!

247
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:50,973
Right. Wait...
I've got it. Fine. Fine.

248
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,644
You should have brought
the iron lung.

249
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,188
Why did I wear stilettos?

250
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:01,066
-Oxygen.
-Oh, my God !

251
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,987
-Auntie Rosie!
-Hey, hey!

252
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:09,408
-Look at Sophie. She's gotten so beautiful!
-I know.

253
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,910
Come here to me.

254
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:20,335
Sophie Sheridan, you get more gorgeous
every time I see you. You do.

255
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,423
-I bet you don't remember me.
-Not with all that plastic surgery.

256
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,844
Of course I do, Auntie Tanya.
You haven't changed at all.

257
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,263
-I'm so happy for you.
-Look at my baby,

258
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,016
her whole life ahead of her.

259
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:39,354
Oh, please, I'm getting married.
I'm not joining a convent!

260
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,440
-She's feisty. I love that.
-Yeah.

261
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,859
She's a chip off the old block.

262
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,779
If she were more like me,
she wouldn't be getting married at 20.

263
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,531
Or married at all.

264
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,785
I meant to get the laundry down
before you came.

265
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,911
Tanya's going home!

266
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,956
And you'd think with all this
new technology,

267
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,001
they would figure out a machine
that would make the beds.

268
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,337
And if they did,
you'd be going along behind it,

269
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,755
making them again.

270
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,465
I know you, Mom.

271
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:11,595
But I am good at modern. . .
Tell them about the Internets.

272
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,805
-He's gonna put me on the line.
-Online.

273
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,265
I'm designing a website.

274
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,519
I just think this place has so much potential,
and no one knows we're here.

275
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:23,982
So, if I market it really, really well, then,
hopefully, people will come flooding in.

276
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:27,986
We just want this to be
the ultimate romantic destination.

277
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,447
This was once supposed to be
the site of Aphrodite's fountain,

278
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,033
you know, the goddess of love.
And if you drank the water,

279
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,827
you were supposed to find true love
and perfect happiness.

280
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,830
-I'll have a glass of that.
-Yeah, I'll have a bucket.

281
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,791
<i>Aphrodite's spa?</i>

282
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,418
Well, I thought you didn't want
boatloads of tourists.

283
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,504
Oh, no, not boatloads, no.

284
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:49,049
But, you know, a few more would be nice.

285
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:54,346
Okay, now, the thing about the toilet,

286
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,559
if it doesn't flush right away, just go
and come back in a while, and it should. . .

287
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,188
Nothing works around here, except for me.

288
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:07,526
I've been running this hotel for 15 years,
and I have never had a day off.

289
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,860
Oh, my God! Sorry.

290
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:09,945


291
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,405


292
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:12,698
<i>I work all night</i>

294
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,577
<i>Ain't it sad?</i>

295
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,539
<i>And still there never seems to be</i>

296
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,166
<i>A single penny left for me</i>

297
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,209
Don't sit down there.

298
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,377
<i>That's too bad</i>

299
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,837
It's broken.

300
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:31,049
<i>In my dreams</i>
<i>I have a plan</i>

301
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:34,553
<i>If I got me a wealthy man</i>

302
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,304
<i>I wouldn't have to work at all</i>

303
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:41,476
<i>I'd fool around and have a ball</i>

304
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,900
<i>Money, money, money</i>

305
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,902
<i>Must be funny</i>

00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,734

316
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,612

317
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:36,031
<i>I bet he wouldn't fancy me</i>

318
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,408

00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:43,955

Do you feel it?

344
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:11,042

We're falling apart here.

00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,296
Don't think about it, come on.
Let's go have fun.

Does she wear it or floss with it?

00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,357
Floss you.

351
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:35,567
Is it edible, Tanya?

352
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,735
Listen to this.

00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:43,033
"contains flakes of 24-karat gold

356
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,243
"and extracts of donkey testicle."

357
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,786
You're just jealous.

358
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,080
At a thousand dollars a dollop.

359
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,749
Tell you, that's the price you have to pay

360
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,293
if you wanna drink before 11:00
in the morning.

361
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,503
-And we do.
-We do.

362
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,590
Hi.

363
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,051
May I help you?

364
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:03,136
Sure, we're here for the wedding.

365
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,888
-I'm Bill Anderson.
-Huh?

366
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:07,349
I'm Bright, Harry Bright.

367
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,101
Sam Carmichael.

368
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,693
You are expecting us?

369
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,737
Oh, my God. Yes!

370
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,657
You're not Donna's daughter?

371
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,618
I thought you looked familiar.

372
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,286
Sofia.

373
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:31,081
-It's Sophie.
-Well, Sofia is the Greek.

374
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,917
Well, I'm named after a Sofia.

375
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:38,380
I used to have a great-aunt
living on the mainland named Sofia.

376
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,384
Would you mind if we see our rooms
before we see your mother?

377
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,551
Sure.

378
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,137
It's just that I'd quite like to freshen up
before the big reunion.

379
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:49,724
No! No! I mean, yes,

380
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,393
but come this way.

381
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,157
Come on!

382
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,242


383
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,331
Oh, my God!

384
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,376
I got a crack in my courtyard.
I gotta go fix it.

385
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,586
-Hey, listen, Donna? Donna.
-I'm serious. Move.

386
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,714
Sit down!

387
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:22,173
-She won't let me go!
-l know...

388
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,884
I know you're going to make
a fortune with web's...

389
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:27,512
-"With web's..."
-With Sky's site.

390
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,139
I know you're gonna make a fortune with

391
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,558
-Sky's website, but...
-It's good.

392
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,518
Are you gonna be okay until then?

393
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,062
I think Tanya is offering to pawn her bling.

394
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:38,565
-No, seriously, Donna...
-Oh, my God.

395
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,900
-Do you need a loan?
-No, sweet.

396
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:44,612
Oh, God, I'm just whining, you know me.

397
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,948
I don't need to be taken care of.

398
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,659
Yeah, but are you being taken care of?

399
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:52,454
-What do you mean?
-Are you getting any?

400
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:53,913
Oh, you mean...

401
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:57,625


402
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,213
Down, boy, down, boy.
No, it takes too much energy.

403
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:05,341
Yeah. Just more plumbing
to be maintained, isn't it?

404
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:06,718
Yeah.

405
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:10,722
Oh, God, I'm so glad
that whole part of my life is over.

406
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,390
You know, seriously.

407
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:13,516


408
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,977
I do not miss it at all.

409
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:18,396


410
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,315


411
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,151
Then it's just right here. Good.

412
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,906
Where's Donna? Hey! Okay.

413
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,493
Up you go.

414
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,412


415
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,458


416
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,169
Hmm.

417
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,172
You know,

418
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,467
I don't want to seem ungrateful
for the scenic tour,

419
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,094
but might I be shown my room now?

420
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:52,514
Well, don't hold your breath, Harry,
but I think this is your room.

421
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,140
Can we see Donna now?

422
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,060
I sent the invites.

423
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,604
My mom doesn't know anything.

424
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,814


425
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:01,898


426
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:05,401
Well, she's done so much for me,
and she's always talking about you guys

427
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:07,487
and the good old days, and

428
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,948
I thought, what an amazing surprise for her

429
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,575
that you are all gonna be at my wedding.

430
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,036
Hang on, Sophie.

431
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:16,955
I can't be here.

432
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:19,249
The last time I saw your mother,

433
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,209
she said she never wanted to see me again.

434
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:25,380
That was years ago.
Please, it would mean a lot to me.

435
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,632
-Why?
-Listen, I can see that you've been

436
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,800
to a great deal of trouble.

437
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,302
Might I suggest that we all reconvene
on your boat?

438
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:32,804
-Good idea.
-Nope.

439
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,598
-Why?
-It's an adventure, Harry.

440
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,433
-It's good for you.
-Oh, I see.

441
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,687
Okay, when I sent the invites,
it was a long shot that you'd even reply.

442
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:43,857
And now you've come all this way
for a wedding.

443
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:48,236
Surely there must have been
some special reason for you to be here.

444
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:52,490
Like some siren call, maybe?

445
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:53,575


446
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:58,163
You're a little minx, you know that?
You're just like your mother.

447
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,790
I'm glad my boys haven't met you.
They'd never recover.

448
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,876
-You have sons?
-Yes, two.

449
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,171
And someday, I'd like to bring them here.

450
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,047
Like you used to bring my mother?

451
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:14,220


452
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,892
-No.
-It's Donna.

453
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:21,686
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Listen, listen, she can't know.

454
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,188
I'm going to go. Please stay.

455
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:27,275
Promise me that you'll not tell anybody
that I invited you.

456
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,860
Okay? Promise?

457
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,154
-You got it, baby.
-It's a promise.

458
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,865
-I might regret it, but okay.
-Okay.

459
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:42,498
There wouldn't, by any chance,
happen to be a trouser press

460
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:43,958
on the island, would there?

461
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,773
Harry?

462
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:10,818


463
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:11,903
Bill?

464
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:13,905


465
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,995
<i>I was cheated by you</i>

466
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,039
<i>And I think you know when</i>

467
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,961
<i>So I made up my mind</i>

468
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,921
<i>It must come to an end</i>

469
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,759
<i>Look at me now</i>

470
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,261
<i>Will I ever learn?</i>

471
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,429
<i>I don't know how</i>

472
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:41,766
<i>But I suddenly lose control</i>

473
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,770
<i>There's a fire within my soul</i>

474
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:49,274
<i>Just one look and</i>
<i>I can hear a bell ring</i>

475
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:52,568
<i>One more look and</i>
<i>I forget everything</i>

476
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,407
<i>Mamma mia</i>
<i>Here I go again</i>

477
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:00,994
<i>My, my</i>
<i>How can I resist you?</i>

478
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:04,455
<i>Mamma mia</i>
<i>Does it show again?</i>

479
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,917
<i>My, my</i>
<i>Just how much I've missed you</i>

480
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:11,462
<i>Yes, I've been broken-hearted</i>

481
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:14,966
<i>Blue since the day we parted</i>

482
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,303
<i>Why, why</i>
<i>did I ever let you go?</i>

483
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,723
<i>Mamma mia</i>
<i>Now I really know</i>

484
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:25,018
<i>My, my</i>
<i>I should not have let you go</i>

485
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,648
<i>I was angry and sad</i>

486
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:32,859
<i>When I knew we were through</i>

487
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,572
<i>I can't count all the times</i>

488
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,449
<i>I have cried over you</i>

489
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:45,830
<i>Look at me now</i>
<i>Will I ever learn?</i>

490
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,999
<i>I don't know how</i>

491
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:51,502
<i>But I suddenly lose control</i>

492
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:55,423
<i>There's a fire within my soul</i>

493
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,885
<i>Just one look and</i>
<i>I can hear a bell ring</i>

494
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:02,430
<i>One more look and</i>
<i>I forget everything</i>

495
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:07,018
<i>Mamma mia</i>
<i>Here I go again</i>

496
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:10,521
<i>My, my</i>
<i>How can I resist you?</i>

497
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:14,067
<i>Mamma mia</i>
<i>Does it show again?</i>

498
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:17,570
<i>My, my</i>
<i>Just how much I've missed you</i>

499
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:21,115
<i>Yes, I've been broken-hearted</i>

500
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,577
<i>Blue since the day we parted</i>

501
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,872
<i>Why, why</i>
<i>did I ever let you go?</i>

502
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:31,542
<i>Mamma mia</i>
<i>Now I really know</i>

503
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:35,463
<i>My, my</i>
<i>I should not have let you go</i>

504
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,259
You always knew how to make an entrance.

505
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,053


506
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,225
I'd better be dreaming.
You'd better not be here.

507
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,726
You want me to pinch you, Donna?

508
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:53,689
No! You keep your hands to yourself,
Bill Anderson.

509
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,318
You probably don't recognize me, do you?

510
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:01,072
Harry! It is you!

511
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,951
I probably changed a bit,
but you certainly haven't.

512
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,747
Why are you here?
What are you doing here?

513
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:11,457
I'm writing a travel piece.

514
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:13,501
I'm here on
a spontaneous holiday.

515
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,585
Uh-huh.

516
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:17,630
I just dropped in to say hi.

517
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,466
Okay. What is this?

518
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:24,429
It's one of those serendipitous moments
in life when three complete strangers

519
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,431
share a common thought.

520
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,100
Strangers?

521
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,813
-You don't know each other?
-That's generally the definition.

522
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,941
Okay, good, but who... Why are you here?

523
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,318
Who said that you could
stay up in my old goat-house?

524
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:40,945
-Didn't catch the name.
-Greek lady.

525
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,780
-Well, she spoke Greek.
-Yeah.

526
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:45,032
Or maybe she said we couldn't
stay in the old goat-house.

527
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,118
-Yeah, maybe that was it, in Greek.
-There you go.

528
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,787
Yeah, that's it, that's it.
You can't stay here because

529
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:52,832
I'm closed and I'm full.

530
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:56,752
And I'm busy, I'm really...
I have a wedding, my...

531
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58,254
Local girl's getting married...

532
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,630
Donna. Donna, don't worry about us.

533
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,174
Bill here is used to roughing it.

534
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,801
-And Harry here...
-I'm spontaneous.

535
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:05,261
-Spontaneous.
-Ah.

536
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,182
What about you?

537
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:11,517
Just wanted to see the island.

538
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,228
You know what it meant to me.

539
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,567
Okay, I'm gonna arrange for a boat

540
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:23,154
to take you all back to the mainland.

541
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,239
-I have a boat, Donna.
-You have a boat?

542
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:26,657
Good, get on it,

543
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:27,950
and anchors away.

544
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,077
-Hey, Donna...
-Away, away.

545
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,455
It's good to see you.

546
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,539


547
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,840
Now, baby, this should
tickle your taste buds.

548
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:46,135
Down, big fella.
I'm old enough to be your mother.

549
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:47,845
Grandmother.

550
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:49,514
Where's Sophie?

551
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,725
-I think she went down to the beach.
-What's up?

552
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:58,231


553
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,944
Donna?

554
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,366
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

555
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,117


556
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,285


557
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,497


558
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,332
Talk to her.

559
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:22,463
<i>Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong</i>

560
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,925


561
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,344
Oh, me.

562
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:33,891
<i>I have never seen such sorrow</i>

563
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:41,148
<i>In your eyes</i>

564
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:46,362
<i>And the wedding is tomorrow</i>

565
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:53,411
<i>How I hate to see you like this</i>

566
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:58,249
<i>There is no way you can deny it</i>

567
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:02,461
<i>I can see</i>

568
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:05,006
<i>That you're oh, so sad</i>

569
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,133
<i>So quiet</i>

570
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:15,891
<i>Chiquitita, tell me the truth</i>

571
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:22,023
<i>I'm a shoulder you can cry on</i>

572
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:27,778
<i>Your best friend</i>

573
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:32,366
<i>I'm the one you must rely on</i>

574
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,330
<i>You were always sure of yourself</i>

575
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:43,628
<i>Now I see you've broken a feather</i>

576
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:53,346
<i>I hope we can patch it up</i>

577
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,097
<i>Together</i>

578
00:32:56,767 --> 00:33:02,396
<i>Chiquitita, you and I know</i>

579
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,607
<i>How the heartaches come and they go</i>

580
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:08,402
<i>And the scars, they're leaving</i>

581
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:11,781
<i>You'll be dancing once again</i>

582
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,617
<i>And the pain will end</i>

583
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:18,621
<i>You will have no time for grieving</i>

584
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:25,920
<i>Chiquitita, you and I cry</i>

585
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,214
<i>But the sun is still in the sky</i>

586
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:32,009
<i>And shining above you</i>

587
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:35,304
<i>Let me hear you sing once more</i>

588
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:38,140
<i>Like you did before</i>

589
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:42,269
<i>Sing a new song, Chiquitita</i>

590
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:47,024
<i>Try once more</i>

591
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:49,568
<i>Like I did before</i>

592
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,279
<i>Sing a new song</i>

593
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,200
-It's her dad.
-Whose dad?

594
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,661
Sophie's dad.

595
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:04,709
Remember how I said it was Sam?
Sam the architect,

596
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,377
who had to go home to get married?

597
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,755
I'm not sure that it was him,

598
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:14,468
because there were two other guys
around the same time.

599
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,848
Donna Sheridan. You shady lady.

600
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,307
Why didn't you tell us?

601
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:23,978
Well, I never knew that
I would ever, ever have to.

602
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,189
I never imagined I'd see all three of them

603
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:28,899
in my old goat-house

604
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:31,569
the day before my daughter's wedding!

605
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,530
-The old goat-house?
-The old goat-house?

606
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,614


607
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:40,077
No! No! Wait!

608
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:41,704
Shoot!

609
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:45,249
Rosie! Tanya!

610
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,918
Wait a minute! Don't let them hear you!

611
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,964
-There's no one here.
-Are you sure?

612
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,507
Of course I'm sure!

613
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,177
Do you think
I would forget my daughter's dads?

614
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:59,180
They were all here. Sam Carmichael,

615
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:02,266
Bill Anderson and Harry "Head Banger."

616
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,642
Harry "Head Banger."

617
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:05,478
They must've gone
back to their boat.

618
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:08,230
I hope they run aground and drown.

619
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:10,024
What are they doing here?

620
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,776
It's like some hideous trick of fate.

621
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,820


622
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:15,905


623
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:16,947


624
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:18,032


625
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:24,538
It's very Greek.

626
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:30,377
-Do they know about Sophie?
-What are they, psychic?

627
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,630
No! I've never told a soul.

628
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:36,175
Oh, Donna,
keeping it to yourself all these years.

629
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,511
It doesn't matter about me.

630
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:44,141
The only thing that matters
is that Sophie never finds out.

631
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:46,477
Well, maybe she would be cool with it.

632
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,103
"Cool with it"?

633
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,855


634
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,484
You don't know my daughter.
This would be like a bombshell.

635
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,236
Donna, they've gone!

636
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,112
I don't know that.

637
00:35:57,197 --> 00:36:00,991
I don't know where they are.
I don't know why they're here.

638
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,285
And I have brought this all on myself

639
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,497
because I was a stupid, reckless little slut!

640
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,999
Whoa!

641
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:11,544
Don't you sound like your mother?

642
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:14,588
-I do not!
-Yes, you so do!

643
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,591
-Oh, my God, I do not.
-You do, it's Catholic guilt!

644
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,301
You've been living like a nun.

645
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:21,804
Yeah, whatever happened to our Donna?

646
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,014
Life and soul of the party,

647
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,892
-<i>el</i> rock chick <i>supremo?</i>
-Yeah, come on.

648
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:31,689
-I grew up.
-Well, then, grow back down again.

649
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,732
-Screw them if they can't take a joke.
-Screw them if they can't take a joke.

650
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:34,859


651
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,236

-Whoa, Sophie.
-Sophie!

704
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,528
We're gonna sail around the island.
You wanna come?

705
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,905
You promised you'd come to my wedding.

706
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:53,283
Yes, well, your mother ejected us
from the goat-house.

707
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,452
She thought we'd better get out of her hair.

Donna freaked out when she saw us.

709
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,499
-What's all that about?
-No.

710
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:04,545
She's just not even thinking straight.
She's so stressed about the wedding.

711
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:08,048
You know, but she's got no idea
that you're her lovely surprise.

712
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:10,092
-She'll be so happy tomorrow.
-You think so?

713
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,176
Mmm-hmm.

714
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:16,223
-You took Mom's guitar!
-No, no. I borrowed it. Look.

715
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,767
No, where is it?

716
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:20,310
D.S.

717
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,395
Donna Sheridan.

718
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:22,771
And H.B.

719
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:24,773
Head Banger.

720
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:26,942
-Head Banger?
-Head Banger?

721
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:30,612
I bought her this. It cost me ten quid
plus my Johnny Rotten T-shirt.

722
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,741
Your mother knew quite a rebel.

723
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:37,744
I was studying in Paris when I met her.

724
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:42,833
I hopped on a train
and followed her to Greece,

725
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:48,130
quite spontaneously.

726
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,091
<i>I can still recall</i>

727
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,261
<i>Our last summer</i>

728
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,263
<i>I still see it all</i>

729
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:01,685
<i>Walks along the Seine</i>

730
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,188
<i>Laughing in the rain</i>

731
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:06,690
<i>Our last summer</i>

732
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,276
<i>Memories that remain</i>

733
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,530
<i>We made our way along the river</i>

734
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:16,658
<i>And we sat down in the grass</i>

735
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:19,328
<i>By the Eiffel Tower</i>

736
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,582
<i>I was so happy we had met</i>

737
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:28,629
<i>It was the age of no regret</i>

738
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,131
<i>Oh, yes</i>

739
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,386
<i>Those crazy years, that was the time</i>

740
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:39,598
<i>Of the flower power</i>

741
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:45,854
<i>But underneath we had a fear of flying</i>

742
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:47,856
<i>Of growing old</i>

743
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:50,359
<i>A fear of slowly dying</i>

744
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,237
<i>We took a chance</i>

745
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:58,659
<i>Like we were dancing our last dance</i>

746
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,411
<i>I can still recall</i>

747
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,164
<i>Our last summer</i>

748
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,833
<i>I still see it all</i>

749
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:13,632
<i>In the tourist jam</i>
<i>round the Notre Dame</i>

750
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,720
<i>Our last summer</i>
<i>Walking hand in hand</i>

751
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,765
<i>Paris restaurants</i>

752
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:27,479
<i>Our last summer</i>
<i>Morning croissants</i>

753
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,358
<i>Living for the day</i>

754
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:33,694
<i>Worries far away</i>

755
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:36,488
<i>Our last summer</i>

756
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:40,659
<i>We could laugh and play</i>

757
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,578
<i>And now you're working in a bank</i>

758
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:49,209
<i>A family man, a football fan</i>

759
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:52,796
<i>And your name is Harry</i>

760
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,299
<i>How dull it seems</i>

761
00:43:55,842 --> 00:44:01,388
<i>Are you the hero</i>
<i>of my dreams?</i>

762
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:05,267
Sophie!

763
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,272
-Sophie!
-Please, I have to go,

764
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,899
-but please come tomorrow, okay?
-Absolutely.

765
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:15,068
-We'll be there.
-It's a promise.

766
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:24,244

Sky!

771
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,385
Where've you been?

772
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:43,638
People have been arriving all afternoon.
No one's seen you.

773
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:46,350
I'm sorry, I was around the island, I just. . .

774
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,602
I just lost track of time.

775
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:52,981
-Where're you going?
-It's my stag do.

776
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,692
My last night of freedom.

777
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,822
Which is how some people might see it,
but for me,

778
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:04,534
it's the last night before
the greatest adventure of my life.

779
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:06,244


780
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,955
You know how I said I wanted
to find my father?

781
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,375
Soph, we've been over this a million times.

782
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,794
You don't need a father, you have a family.

783
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:15,545
And you'll never leave me, right?

784
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,466
Are you kidding?
You have turned my world upside down.

785
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:21,426


786
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:24,137
<i>I wasn't jealous before we met</i>

787
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:29,726
<i>Now every man that</i>
<i>I see is a potential threat</i>

788
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:35,732
<i>And I'm possessive</i>
<i>It isn't nice</i>

789
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:40,570
<i>You've heard me saying</i>
<i>that smoking was my only vice</i>

790
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,033
<i>But now it isn't true</i>

791
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:48,537
<i>Now everything is new</i>

792
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:53,500
<i>And all I've learned has overturned</i>

793
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:57,671
<i>I beg of you</i>

794
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:05,679
<i>Don't go wasting your emotion</i>

795
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:12,310
<i>Lay all your love on me</i>

796
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:16,690
<i>It was like shooting a sitting duck</i>

797
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:21,862
<i>A little smal talk, a smile</i>
<i>and, baby, I was stuck</i>

798
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:28,076
<i>I still don't know what you've done with me</i>

799
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:32,873
<i>A grown-up woman</i>
<i>should never fall so easily</i>

800
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:38,170
<i>I feel a kind of fear</i>

801
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:42,090
<i>When I don't have you near</i>

802
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:45,927
<i>Unsatisfied, I skip my pride</i>

803
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:50,307
<i>I beg you, dear</i>

804
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:57,856

<i>-Thank you.</i>
-Okay.

872
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,955
Why are they here, then,

873
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:26,458
if it's not to ruin Sophie's wedding?

874
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:29,544
But I thought you weren't so keen
on this wedding.

875
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:31,755
I don't want them spoiling it.

876
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,923
They have no right to turn up like this.

877
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:36,718
What have they ever done
for their daughter?

878
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,928
Donna, Donna, they didn't know she existed.

879
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:41,055
Well, they didn't need to know, did they?

880
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,516
I've done a great job with Soph,
all by myself,

881
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:46,811
and I won't be muscled out
by an ejaculation!

<i>A man after midnight</i>

886
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:06,706
<i>Won't somebody help me</i>
<i>Chase the shadows away</i>

887
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:10,460
<i>Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!</i>
<i>A man after midnight</i>

888
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,003
-Hi.
-Hi.

889
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,254


890
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:16,132
I think I should explain to Donna
that I come in peace.

891
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:19,844
Oh, no, really. You should wait
until she has a few drinks in her first.

892
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:21,930
-Really.
-Good idea. Good idea.

893
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,849
What you drew on the boat...

894
00:52:26,227 --> 00:52:28,686
This is good. This is really good.

895
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:31,940
Why don't you pursue this?
You have a real talent here.

896
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:33,233


897
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:35,151
I have enough to do here.

898
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:37,237
Is that really your dream?

899
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,322
Running the villa with Donna?

900
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,491
She just can't do it by herself.

901
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:45,787
Do you know,

902
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:49,582
I drew this whole place up
on the back of a menu one night.

903
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:51,501
I always dreamt I'd come back here.

904
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,127
What kept you?

905
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,672
What's your mother said about me?

906
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:58,675
-She never mentioned you.
-Sophie?

907
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,512
What am I doing here?

908
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:05,682
Some air in here.

909
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:08,351


910
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:11,271
Somebody up there has got it in for me.

911
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,564
I bet it's my mother.

912
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,524
Oh,
and wasn't she a ray of sunshine.

913
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,734
I'm gonna go get them out of here.

914
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:18,653


915
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:21,823
You go in there guns loaded,
there's gonna be questions.

916
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,867
-Help me out of these boots.
-Come on, then.

917
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:26,536
All that fricking yoga's
made my feet bigger.

918
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,455
Now, listen.
Listen, what we're gonna do is,

919
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:32,000
we'll get them plastered tonight,

920
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:36,629
and then tomorrow,
Tanya and I will take them fishing.

921
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:39,424
Fishing? Oh, please.

922
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:42,635
What do you suggest
we do with three men?

923
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:46,139
Well, then, now, that takes me back.

924
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,808
<i>Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!</i>

925
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:51,060
<i>A man after midnight</i>

926
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:54,981
<i>Take me through the darkness</i>
<i>To the break of the day</i>

927
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:02,864
-Hello.
-You okay?

928
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,574
I'm fine.

929
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:05,658


930
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:09,829
Fancy Donna having a grown-up daughter!

931
00:54:10,331 --> 00:54:14,751
-Do you have any children, Harry?
-Well, I have the dogs, Lucy and Kipper.

932
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:17,378
That's the extent of my relationships.

933
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:20,924
I'd have loved a daughter.
I'd have spoiled her rotten.

934
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:26,512
-Is your father here?
-I don't know.

935
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:31,392
I don't know who my father is.

936
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:32,852


937
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:34,812
<i>Is there a man out there?</i>

938
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:39,192
<i>Someone to hear my prayer?</i>

939
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:42,320
This is fantastic!

940
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:47,450
How on earth did Donna get money
to buy this place?

941
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:51,621
She was left some money by the old lady
she looked after when I was little.

942
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:55,750
-Sofia, that I'm named after.
-My great-aunt Sofia?

943
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,377
I guess.

944
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:01,130
I always heard her money was left to family.

945
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,473
-How old are you?
-I'm 20.

946
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:11,766


947
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:16,396
Will you excuse me a minute?

948
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:20,942
I'm sorry.

949
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:25,488
Bill!

950
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:28,574
Bill, wait.

951
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:31,953
Why did your great-aunt
leave my mother money?

952
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:33,538
I don't know!

953
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:36,249
All my life, there's been
this huge unanswered question,

954
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,751
and I don't want any more secrecy!

955
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:41,796
-What do you want from me?
-Bill, please!

956
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,927
Are you my father?

957
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:51,264
Yes. I think so.

958
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,101
Yes.

959
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,271
You know what comes next?

960
00:55:58,439 --> 00:56:02,734
Oh, you're not going to tell me
that you have a twin sister, are you?

961
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,154
Will you give me away tomorrow?

962
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:09,741
-Give you away?
-No! Our secret until the wedding.

963
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:12,744


964
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:14,037
Cute.

965
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,126
Oh, God.

966
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:24,547
Okay.

967
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,133


968
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:29,052


969
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,180


970
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,606


971
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:48,654
<i>People everywhere</i>

972
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:51,824
<i>A sense of expectation hanging in the air</i>

973
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:56,204
<i>Giving out a spark</i>

974
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:59,332
<i>Across the room</i>
<i>your eyes are glowing in the dark</i>

975
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:05,338
<i>And here we go again</i>
<i>We know the start, we know the end</i>

976
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:08,508
<i>Masters of the scene</i>

977
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:12,929
<i>We've done it all before</i>
<i>And now we're back to get some more</i>

978
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:15,681
<i>You know what I mean</i>

979
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:18,851

Sophie, come here.

990
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,756
I know why I'm here.

991
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:52,552
Why didn't Donna tell me?
How long have you known I'm your father?

992
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:56,305
What? Not long at all.

993
00:57:56,807 --> 00:58:00,560
Sam, listen to me.
My mom doesn't know that I know.

994
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:03,229
So can we wait until after my wedding?

995
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,481
-Who's giving you away tomorrow?
-Nobody.

996
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:06,983
Wrong. I am.

997
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:09,026

-I'm your father!
-Harry!

1010
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:39,056
Now, that's why you sent me the invite.

1011
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:42,226
You wanted your old dad
to walk you down the aisle.

1012
00:58:42,311 --> 00:58:45,646
Well, I won't let you down. I'll be there.

<i>...upside down.</i>

1023
00:59:13,634 --> 00:59:15,551

Soph!

1027

Stand back, everybody.
Give her some space.

1028
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,939
Soph...
Baby!

1029
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:35,905
Come on, Mother, rise and shine.

1030
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,573
I was tossing and turning all night.

1031
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:38,658


1032
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:41,911
Those three guys are still loose
on this island.

1033
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,120
We got to do something.

1034
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:46,499
Donna! Donna! Donna! Donna.
It's all under control.

1035
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:50,544
I have been tossing and turning all night.
I've got three dads coming to my wedding,

1036
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:53,214
and I have to tell two of them
they're surplus. Only, which two?

1037
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:54,590
It's all under control.

1038
00:59:54,675 --> 00:59:56,592
I'm taking Bill and Sam fishing...

1039
00:59:56,677 --> 00:59:58,928
We're each gonna go off.
We're gonna grab a man,

1040
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:01,347
interrogate him, swap notes and decide.

1041
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:04,058
And Harry's talked Tanya into water sports.

1042
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:05,393


1043
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:08,437
Oh, God.
Nurse, donkey testicles, quickly!

1044
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:09,522


1045
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:34,839
-No, after you. Please.
-No. No. Go ahead.

1046
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:37,216
No, no, no, no, you first.

1047
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:41,554
-I want to get something off my chest.
-Me, too.

1048
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:52,106
Last night,
I discovered something wonderful.

1049
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:56,068
It was a wake-up call,
a way to look at myself and

1050
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,654
what I really want out of life.

1051
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:03,909
Last night? You didn't know?

1052
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:08,164
You didn't even suspect that you were...

1053
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:11,625
Well, no. Of course not.
That's always been a secret.

1054
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:16,505
And now we... Say it out loud.

1055
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:20,092
No! No! No! It's absolutely hush-hush.
I mean, for now.

1056
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:22,845
All will be revealed tonight.

1057
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:26,390
Talking of revelations, last night. . .

1058
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:31,771
You and the little lady?
I think I know what's going on.

1059
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:33,356


1060
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,358
-No, you don't. You don't.
-It's obvious.

1061
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:38,527
I saw it from the moment
you clapped eyes on each other.

1062
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:40,946
You're kidding.

1063
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:44,450
I'm gonna level with you, Harry.

1064
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,827
I don't think I can do this.

1065
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,288
Well, she's a wonderful girl,

1066
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:52,458
but can I take her on in my life?

1067
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,419
Bill, where's your spontaneity?

1068
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,838
It's this...

1069
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:02,676
-This family, you know?
-You don't have to marry her.

1070
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:04,553
What?

1071
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:05,805


1072
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:09,225
Hey, right in time for breakfast.

1073
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:12,144
We're serving up the works here.

1074
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:15,648
-Think you just did.
-Sunny-side up! Lox or ham?

1075
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,400
I'll just. . .

1076
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,654
I'm just gonna. . .

1077
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:24,073


1078
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:26,325
What a mess!

1079
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:30,371
-Hey!
-What?

1080
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:33,958
-You okay?
-Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

1081
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:36,085
-Sophie.
-What?

1082
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:41,549
Last night, you and Sky... What's wrong?

1083
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:46,679
Tell me. Tell me what's wrong.

1084
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:54,186
-I don't know what to do.
-You know what to do.

1085
01:02:57,858 --> 01:03:00,151
You don't have to do anything.

1086
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:06,198
Not too late, I can still call off the wedding.
Everybody will understand.

1087
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:08,492
Call... Call off the wedding?

1088
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,911
-Isn't that what you want?
-No.

1089
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:12,746
No.

1090
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:16,041
No, that's what you want.

1091
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:17,835
-No!
-Yes! God !

1092
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:18,919
Sophie!

1093
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:21,630
You just... You have no idea.

1094
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:22,882
You never had a wedding.

1095
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:24,800
You never did
the marriage-and-babies thing.

1096
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:26,177
You just did the baby thing.

1097
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:28,179
-Well, good for you.
-You know, I don't know why

1098
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:31,932
-you're going off on me now! I really don't!
-Because I...

1099
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,519
-God! I love Sky, and I want to be with him!
-Good! Great.

1100
01:03:35,604 --> 01:03:39,899
And I don't want my children growing up
not knowing who their father is.

1101
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:42,193
Because it's just... It's crap!

1102
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:45,529
Voulez-vous

1103
01:03:45,614 --> 01:03:46,655


1104
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:49,700
-What are you doing?
-Stop, you're terrible.

1105
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:51,702
Come on, man. What are you talking about?

1106
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:55,915
Okay, okay, Sophie's gonna have
an absolutely beautiful wedding, right?

1107
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:58,542
You're supposed to be helping me.

1108
01:03:58,627 --> 01:04:01,086
You guys... He's got to get ready.

1109
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:11,764
I see you kept my bagpipes.

1110
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:17,728
They're supposed to ward off
unwanted visitors.

1111
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:22,358
Well, you don't need bagpipes to do that.

1112
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:25,653
What are you doing here, Sam?

1113
01:04:25,946 --> 01:04:28,113
This is our dream, remember?

1114
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:32,910
-Villa on the island?
-Yeah. Well, this is my reality.

1115
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:36,413
Hard work and a crippling mortgage. Shoot!

1116
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:41,126
And a hotel that's crumbling around me.

1117
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:45,339
-Look, I'll help... Let me have a look at this...
-No, that's all right, I can

1118
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:47,424
deal my own disasters.

1119
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:50,678
Why didn't you tell me
it was Sophie getting married?

1120
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:52,263
Well, I didn't think
it was any of your business.

1121
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:54,390
Why is she getting married?
Settling down on the island?

1122
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:57,601
I mean, if it was up to me,
I'd be telling her to go get a life.

1123
01:04:57,686 --> 01:04:59,395
-Yeah.
-She's a bright kid.

1124
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:01,438
I know. I know.

1125
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:04,692
But, you know, my daughter
has a mind of her own.

1126
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:09,321
Oh, yeah. I see that. I see that.

1127
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:12,825
-But she's so young.
-I know.

1128
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,286
I mean, does she know
what she really wants?

1129
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:18,455
You see, I think part of her
just wants to let you know

1130
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:22,167
that she isn't going to leave you
alone here, on your own.

1131
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:26,672
-What do you mean?
-Donna, look.

1132
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:30,342
I have two grown children.
I know something about letting go.

1133
01:05:30,677 --> 01:05:32,303
If Sophie felt you were okay on your own,

1134
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:34,763
would she want something different
for herself?

1135
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:36,974
Okay, here's the thing.

1136
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:40,102
I love being on my own. I really do.

1137
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:42,229
You know, every morning,
I get up and I thank God

1138
01:05:42,314 --> 01:05:44,815
that I don't have some middle-aged,
menopausal man

1139
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:46,525
telling me how to run my life.

1140
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:49,320
You know, I'm free and I'm single.

1141
01:05:50,739 --> 01:05:53,032
And it's great.

1142
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:54,116


1143
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:58,537
<i>Where are those happy days?</i>
<i>They seem so hard to find</i>

1144
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:04,084
<i>I try to reach for you</i>
<i>But you have closed your mind</i>

1145
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:09,006
<i>What ever happened to our love?</i>

1146
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:12,509
<i>I wish I understood</i>

1147
01:06:14,012 --> 01:06:18,599
<i>It used to be so nice</i>
<i>It used to be so good</i>

1148
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:25,272
<i>So when you're near me, darling</i>
<i>Can't you hear me?</i>

1149
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:26,732
<i>SOS</i>

1150
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:32,988
<i>The love you gave me</i>
<i>Nothing else can save me</i>

1151
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:34,406
<i>SOS</i>

1152
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:41,246
<i>When you're gone</i>
<i>How can I even try to go on?</i>

1153
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:49,088
<i>When you're gone, though I try</i>
<i>How can I carry on?</i>

1154
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:57,763
<i>You seem so far away</i>
<i>though you are standing near</i>

1155
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:03,686
<i>You made me feel alive</i>
<i>but something died, I fear</i>

1156
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:08,190
<i>I really tried to make it out</i>

1157
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,777
<i>I wish I understood</i>

1158
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:17,408
<i>What happened to our love?</i>
<i>It used to be so good</i>

1159
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:23,372
<i>So when you're near me, darling</i>
<i>Can't you hear me?</i>

1160
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:24,790
<i>SOS</i>

1161
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:31,130
<i>And the love you gave me</i>
<i>Nothing else can save me</i>

1162
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:32,464
<i>SOS</i>

1163
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:36,218
<i>-When you're gone</i>
<i>-When you're gone</i>

1164
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:39,930
<i>-How can I even try to go on?</i>
<i>-How can I even try to go on?</i>

1165
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:44,184
<i>-When you're gone</i>
<i>-When you're gone</i>

1166
01:07:44,269 --> 01:07:48,105
<i>-Though I try how can I carry on?</i>
<i>-Though I try how can I carry on?</i>

1167
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:51,942


1168
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:58,615


1169
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:14,256
Donna must be tearing her hair out,
doing this wedding on her own.

1170
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:17,092
What would the father of the bride
normally do?

1171
01:08:17,177 --> 01:08:21,513
Pay. Though my dad
drew the line at my third.

1172
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:24,767
I see. Excuse me.

1173
01:08:25,977 --> 01:08:27,186
Harry?

1174
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,273
Harry!

1175
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:36,570
Tanya! Let's pick up
where we left off last night.

1176
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:39,281
Last night never happened.

1177
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,825
I've drawn a veil over last night.

1178
01:08:42,494 --> 01:08:45,120
Oh, my God. Look at the time.
I've got work to do.

1179
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:47,748
-Work?
-A little repair and renovation.

1180
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:51,585
Come on.
You don't mess with a masterpiece.

1181
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:54,630
Oh, ignore him, Tanya,
he's all mouth and no trousers.

1182
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:57,007
Tanya can't ignore the chemistry
between us.

1183
01:08:57,091 --> 01:09:00,677
Little boys who play with fire
get their fingers burned.

1184
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,597


1185
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:10,354
<i>You're so hot, teasing me</i>

1186
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:15,901
<i>So you're blue</i>
<i>Well, I can't take a chance on a kid like you</i>

1187
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:19,530
<i>It's something I couldn't do</i>

1188
01:09:22,534 --> 01:09:26,036
<i>There's that look in your eyes</i>

1189
01:09:26,246 --> 01:09:31,124
<i>I can read in your face</i>
<i>that your feelings are driving you wild</i>

1190
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:34,711
<i>Oh, but, boy, you're only a child</i>

1191
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:41,009
<i>Well, I can dance with you, honey</i>
<i>If you think it's funny</i>

1192
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:43,762
<i>But does your mother know</i>
<i>that you're out?</i>

1193
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:48,308
<i>And I can chat with you, baby</i>
<i>Flirt a little, maybe</i>

1194
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:50,894
<i>Does your mother know</i>
<i>that you're out?</i>

1195
01:09:51,771 --> 01:09:55,274
<i>-Take it easy</i>
<i>-Take it easy. Better slow down, boy</i>

1196
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:58,861
<i>That's no way to go</i>
<i>Does your mother know?</i>

1197
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:02,406
<i>-Take it easy</i>
<i>-Take it easy. Try to cool it, boy</i>

1198
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:06,034
<i>Play it nice and slow</i>
<i>Does your mother know?</i>

1199
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,459
Come on, boy.

1200
01:10:20,884 --> 01:10:23,802
<i>I can see what you want</i>

1201
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:29,308
<i>But you seem pretty young</i>
<i>To be searching for that kind of fun</i>

1202
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:32,978
<i>So maybe I'm not the one</i>

1203
01:10:35,857 --> 01:10:39,318
<i>Now you're so cute</i>
<i>I like your style</i>

1204
01:10:39,694 --> 01:10:45,449
<i>And I know what you mean</i>
<i>When you give me a flash of that smile</i>

1205
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:48,660
<i>But, boy, you're only a child</i>

1206
01:10:50,622 --> 01:10:54,625
<i>Well, I can dance with you, honey</i>
<i>If you think it's funny</i>

1207
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:57,169
<i>Does your mother know</i>
<i>that you're out?</i>

1208
01:10:57,879 --> 01:11:01,757
<i>And I can chat with you, baby</i>
<i>Flirt a little, maybe</i>

1209
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:04,343
<i>Does your mother know that you're out?</i>

1210
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:09,014
<i>Well, I can dance with you, honey</i>
<i>If you think it's funny</i>

1211
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,516
<i>Does your mother know that you're out?</i>

1212
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:16,146
<i>And I can chat with you, baby</i>
<i>Flirt a little, maybe</i>

1213
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:25,572
<i>Does your mother know that you're out?</i>

1214
01:11:25,657 --> 01:11:29,451
<i>Does your mother know?</i>
<i>Does your mother know that you're out?</i>

1215
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,535


1216
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:33,038


1217
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,833
Boy down! Boy down!

1218
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:40,128
Yo, girls. We done good.

1219
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:43,548
Yes, any color. Doesn't matter.

1220
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:46,802
There's no plan,
God knows there's no plan.

1221
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:48,929
-It looks great, though.
-<i>Ella,</i> Donna, where would you like this?

1222
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:51,974
Carlos, get the meat out of the heat.

1223
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:56,228
Put a cover on that thing. That's beautiful.
And tell... Ione, help him get the...

1224
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:59,272
-Harry, what are you doing here?
-Hello.

1225
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:01,274
I just wanted to give you this.

1226
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:03,151
I don't mean here, here.

1227
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:07,406
-I mean, why are you on this island?
-I realized. . .

1228
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,992
What is this?

1229
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:13,620
Now, I realized you'll have had to
tighten your belt a bit over the years,

1230
01:12:13,705 --> 01:12:15,747
bringing up Sophie on your own,

1231
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:19,251
and I just wanted to make
a small contribution to the wedding.

1232
01:12:23,381 --> 01:12:26,591
-I can't accept this. I can't...
-No. No.

1233
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:28,343
-Harry, I can't.
-No. No.

1234
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:31,430
-Harry? l can't. . .
-No, you'll have to catch me first.

1235
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:35,475
-Sky.
-What's the matter?

1236
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:38,228
-You have to help me.
-Why, what's happened?

1237
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:39,771
Baby?

1238
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:42,274
Sophie!

1239
01:12:43,151 --> 01:12:44,276
Soph.

1240
01:12:46,154 --> 01:12:48,780
I've done something completely insane.

1241
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:52,367
All my dads are here for our wedding,
and they all think they're giving me away.

1242
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:53,952
All your what?

1243
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:59,541
I read Mom's diary,
and I have three possible fathers.

1244
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:02,961
But how are they here now?

1245
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:04,880
I invited them.

1246
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:08,717
I thought that I would know my dad
right away,

1247
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:10,469
but I didn't. I just...

1248
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:13,096
I have no idea.
And now, my mom is gonna kill me,

1249
01:13:13,181 --> 01:13:15,557
-and they're gonna hate me, and you. . .
-Hold on. Hold on.

1250
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:17,726
You invited these guys
and you didn't tell me?

1251
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,562
No, I thought you would try to stop me.

1252
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:24,107
-I know I messed up.
-Sophie?

1253
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:28,070
Is that what this whole
big white wedding is about?

1254
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:30,989
-You finding your dad?
-No. No!

1255
01:13:31,074 --> 01:13:33,533
I wanted to take a boat to the mainland
with a couple of witnesses.

1256
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:36,495
And you insisted on this sodding circus
so you could play Happy Families.

1257
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:39,915
It's about knowing who I am. And I wanted
to get married knowing who I am.

1258
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:42,876
That doesn't come from finding your father,

1259
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:45,670
that comes from finding yourself.

1260
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:50,175
And the irony is,
I was traveling to find myself.

1261
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:54,012
I put everything on hold for you.

1262
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:58,850
Because I loved you
and I wanted what you wanted.

1263
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:00,352
Now, I don't know.

1264
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:02,270
You don't know if you love me?

1265
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:05,440
Of course I love you.
I just wish you'd told me.

1266
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:08,944
Is everything okay?

1267
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,905
-Sophie, what's wrong?
-Not now, Sam.

1268
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:13,573
Yes, yes, yes, now.

1269
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:15,742
Because I'm supposed to be
giving you away.

1270
01:14:15,827 --> 01:14:17,911
And how can I when I know
you're not really gonna be happy?

1271
01:14:17,995 --> 01:14:21,123
I've heard all this from my mother, and
I think she knows me better than you do.

1272
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:24,084
I know. But I've done the big white wedding,
and believe me,

1273
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:27,879
-it doesn't always end in "happy ever after."
-That is you. That's not me.

1274
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:30,799
Okay? I love Sky more than anything
in the world. And I...

1275
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:31,925


1276
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:34,928
Did you feel that way
before you got married?

1277
01:14:36,764 --> 01:14:37,848
No.

1278
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:57,826
Hey, aren't you supposed to be
getting dressed?

1279
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:00,996
Where's Ali and Lisa?
I thought they were going to help you.

1280
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,747
Will you help me?

1281
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:04,916
Mmm-hmm.

1282
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:06,751


1283
01:15:07,295 --> 01:15:11,214
Wait. It's okay, it's okay.

1284
01:15:11,382 --> 01:15:13,091
We have time.

1285
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:16,970


1286
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:20,098
<i>Schoolbag in hand</i>

1287
01:15:20,183 --> 01:15:24,895
<i>She leaves home in the early morning</i>

1288
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:26,980
<i>Waving goodbye</i>

1289
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:32,569
<i>With an absent-minded smile</i>

1290
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:35,405
<i>I watch her go</i>

1291
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:39,868
<i>With a surge of that well-known sadness</i>

1292
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:45,415
<i>And I have to sit down for a while</i>

1293
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:49,544
<i>The feeling that I'm losing her</i>

1294
01:15:49,629 --> 01:15:52,881
<i>Forever</i>

1295
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:59,095
<i>And without really entering her world</i>

1296
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:04,643
<i>I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter</i>

1297
01:16:04,769 --> 01:16:09,314
<i>That funny little girl</i>

1298
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,859
<i>Slipping through my fingers all the time</i>

1299
01:16:12,944 --> 01:16:17,572
<i>I try to capture every minute</i>

1300
01:16:17,657 --> 01:16:23,119
<i>The feeling in it</i>
<i>Slipping through my fingers all the time</i>

1301
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:26,122
<i>Do I really see what's in her mind?</i>

1302
01:16:26,207 --> 01:16:31,253
<i>Each time I think I'm close to knowing</i>

1303
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:33,421
<i>She keeps on growing</i>

1304
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:39,427
<i>Slipping through my fingers all the time</i>

1305
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:42,389
<i>Sleep in our eyes</i>

1306
01:16:42,473 --> 01:16:47,185
<i>Her and me at the breakfast table</i>

1307
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:49,145
<i>Barely awake</i>

1308
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:54,901
<i>I let precious time go by</i>

1309
01:16:54,986 --> 01:17:01,783
<i>Then when she's gone</i>
<i>There's that odd melancholy feeling</i>

1310
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:08,540
<i>And a sense of guilt I can't deny</i>

1311
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:15,213
<i>What happened to</i>
<i>those wonderful adventures</i>

1312
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:19,801
<i>The places I had planned for us to go</i>

1313
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:21,761
<i>Slipping through my fingers all the time</i>

1314
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:24,806
<i>Well, some of that we did</i>

1315
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:27,475
<i>But most we didn't</i>

1316
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:31,688
<i>And why, I just don't know</i>

1317
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:34,649
<i>Slipping through my fingers all the time</i>

1318
01:17:34,734 --> 01:17:39,946
<i>I try to capture every minute</i>

1319
01:17:40,031 --> 01:17:45,535
<i>The feeling in it</i>
<i>Slipping through my fingers all the time</i>

1320
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:48,496
<i>Do I really see what's in her mind?</i>

1321
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:53,668
<i>Each time I think I'm close to knowing</i>

1322
01:17:53,753 --> 01:17:55,795
<i>She keeps on growing</i>

1323
01:17:55,880 --> 01:18:01,259
<i>Slipping through my fingers all the time</i>

1324
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:03,136


1325
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:11,644
Do you think I'm letting you down?

1326
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:16,524
Why would you even think that?

1327
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:19,527
Well, because of what you've done.

1328
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:22,697
I mean, the Dynamos, raising a kid,

1329
01:18:22,782 --> 01:18:25,158
and running a business all on your own.

1330
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:28,370
Well, honey, I didn't have a choice.

1331
01:18:28,454 --> 01:18:31,122
I couldn't go home, you know.

1332
01:18:32,917 --> 01:18:38,129
When I got pregnant, my mother told me
not to bother coming back.

1333
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:43,259
And I wouldn't have had it any other way.

1334
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:45,804
My God, look at what we've had.

1335
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:52,477
Will you give me away?

1336
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:03,405
Yeah.

1337
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:09,202
<i>Sometimes I wish</i>

1338
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:14,582
<i>That I could freeze the picture</i>

1339
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:18,837
<i>And save it from the funny tricks of time</i>

1340
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:23,925
<i>Slipping through my fingers</i>

1341
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,877
<i>Schoolbag in hand</i>

1342
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:03,798
<i>She leaves home in the early morning</i>

1343
01:20:03,883 --> 01:20:06,050
<i>Waving goodbye</i>

1344
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:12,765
<i>With an absent-minded smile</i>

1345
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:20,190
Donna!

1346
01:20:21,108 --> 01:20:23,985
Donna. I need to talk to you about
who's giving Sophie away.

1347
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:26,029
-That would be me.
-But...

1348
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:28,823
-What about her dad?
-Her dad isn't here.

1349
01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:32,744
It's what she wants.
She told me she wants her father here.

1350
01:20:32,912 --> 01:20:37,207
-What if her father wants that, too?
-What? Sam, don't do this now.

1351
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:40,502
I can't hear this now!

1352
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:44,172
Donna, listen to me. This is about us.

1353
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:45,340

1354
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:47,091
<i>I don't wanna talk</i>

1355
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:51,262
<i>About things we've gone through</i>

1356
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:54,516
<i>Though it's hurting me</i>

1357
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:58,436
<i>Now it's history</i>

1358
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:03,274
<i>I've played all my cards</i>

1359
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:08,029
<i>And that's what you've done, too</i>

1360
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:11,366
<i>Nothing more to say</i>

1361
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:14,202
<i>No more ace to play</i>

1362
01:21:15,621 --> 01:21:19,457
<i>The winner takes it all</i>

1363
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:23,211
<i>The loser standing small</i>

1364
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:27,215
<i>Beside the victory</i>

1365
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:31,386
<i>That's her destiny</i>

1366
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:35,181
<i>I was in your arms</i>

1367
01:21:35,266 --> 01:21:38,726
<i>Thinking I belonged there</i>

1368
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:42,272
<i>I figured it made sense</i>

1369
01:21:42,356 --> 01:21:45,316
<i>Building me a fence</i>

1370
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:50,488
<i>Building me a home</i>

1371
01:21:50,614 --> 01:21:54,325
<i>Thinking I'd be strong there</i>

1372
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:56,494
<i>But I was a fool</i>

1373
01:21:57,746 --> 01:22:01,749
<i>Playing by the rules</i>

1374
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:05,587
<i>The gods may throw the dice</i>

1375
01:22:05,671 --> 01:22:09,424
<i>Their minds as cold as ice</i>

1376
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:13,261
<i>And someone way down here</i>

1377
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:17,098
<i>Loses someone dear</i>

1378
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:20,852
<i>The winner takes it all</i>

1379
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:24,606
<i>The loser has to fall</i>

1380
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:28,484
<i>It's simple and it's plain</i>

1381
01:22:28,569 --> 01:22:32,614
<i>Why should I complain?</i>

1382
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:36,451
<i>But tell me does she kiss</i>

1383
01:22:36,535 --> 01:22:40,121
<i>Like I used to kiss you?</i>

1384
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:43,833
<i>Does it feel the same</i>

1385
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:47,795
<i>When she calls your name?</i>

1386
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:51,883
<i>Somewhere deep inside</i>

1387
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:55,303
<i>You must know I miss you</i>

1388
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:57,263
<i>But what can I say?</i>

1389
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:02,727
<i>Rules must be obeyed</i>

1390
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:06,606
<i>The judges will decide</i>

1391
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:10,485
<i>The likes of me abide</i>

1392
01:23:10,569 --> 01:23:14,405
<i>Spectators at the show</i>

1393
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:18,034
<i>Always staying low</i>

1394
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:21,829
<i>The game is on again</i>

1395
01:23:21,914 --> 01:23:25,667
<i>A lover or a friend</i>

1396
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:29,504
<i>A big thing or a small</i>

1397
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:34,050
<i>The winner takes it all</i>

1398
01:23:35,594 --> 01:23:37,595
<i>I don't wanna talk</i>

1399
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:41,849
<i>'Cause it makes me feel sad</i>

1400
01:23:43,143 --> 01:23:45,436
<i>And I understand</i>

1401
01:23:46,814 --> 01:23:48,981
<i>You've come to shake my hand</i>

1402
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:54,570
<i>I apologize</i>

1403
01:23:54,655 --> 01:23:58,282
<i>If it makes you feel bad</i>

1404
01:23:58,367 --> 01:24:00,993
<i>Seeing me so tense</i>

1405
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:05,373
<i>No self-confidence, but you see</i>

1406
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:19,637
<i>The winner takes it all</i>

1407
01:24:20,973 --> 01:24:24,142
<i>The game is on again</i>

1408
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:27,937
<i>A lover or a friend</i>

1409
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:31,691
<i>A big thing or a small</i>

1410
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:36,904
<i>The winner takes it all</i>

1411
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:43,411
<i>So the winner takes it all</i>

1412
01:24:44,705 --> 01:24:50,960
<i>And the loser has to fall</i>

1413
01:24:52,296 --> 01:24:58,801
<i>So the winner takes it all</i>

1414
01:24:59,803 --> 01:25:05,641
<i>And the loser has to fall</i>

1415
01:25:05,726 --> 01:25:07,351
Donna!

1416
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,440
<i>The winner takes it</i>

1417
01:25:14,485 --> 01:25:20,364
<i>All</i>

1418
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:34,045


1419
01:25:37,174 --> 01:25:39,884
Donna, there you are.

1420
01:25:40,219 --> 01:25:42,220
-It's okay.
-They're my best shoes.

1421
01:25:42,304 --> 01:25:44,680
Panic over! Here she is.
She's here.

1422
01:25:44,765 --> 01:25:47,934
-Oh, don't worry.
-Oh, God.

1423
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:07,620


1424
01:26:36,775 --> 01:26:37,942
I love you.

1425
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:46,033
Welcome to Sophie and Sky,

1426
01:26:46,118 --> 01:26:49,829
and to all your friends
who have gathered together this evening.

1427
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:54,250
And welcome, especially, to Donna,
who represents your family.

1428
01:26:54,334 --> 01:26:56,377
We are all here together in this

1429
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:59,797
-glorious...
-And welcome to...

1430
01:26:59,882 --> 01:27:01,257
To

1431
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:02,717
Sophie's dad.

1432
01:27:02,801 --> 01:27:03,968


1433
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:07,597
-I have to tell you. He is here.
-I know. I invited him.

1434
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:12,184
You couldn't have.
I don't know which one it is.

1435
01:27:12,269 --> 01:27:14,645


1436
01:27:15,272 --> 01:27:16,647
Oh, my God.

1437
01:27:17,691 --> 01:27:20,735
-That's why they're all here!
-I'm sorry. Sorry. I just...

1438
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:24,363
Please, please forgive me!
Please forgive me. Please.

1439
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:26,157
I don't know.

1440
01:27:28,994 --> 01:27:31,412
-Can you forgive me?
-What?

1441
01:27:32,331 --> 01:27:35,917
I don't care if you slept with
hundreds of men.

1442
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:40,838
You're my mom, and I love you so much.

1443
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:44,508
Oh, Soph.

1444
01:27:47,512 --> 01:27:50,723
And I haven't slept with hundreds of men.

1445
01:27:50,891 --> 01:27:52,266


1446
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:57,605
Am I getting this right?

1447
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:02,777
Sophie may be mine,
but she may be Bill's or Harry's?

1448
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:06,530
Yeah, yeah. That's right.
And don't get all self-righteous with me,

1449
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:09,283
because you have
no one but yourself to blame.

1450
01:28:09,368 --> 01:28:13,579
Yeah, if you hadn't just dumped my mother
and gone off and married somebody else. . .

1451
01:28:13,664 --> 01:28:18,250
Hey, hey, wait a minute!
I had to go home. I was engaged.

1452
01:28:18,335 --> 01:28:21,712
But I told Lorraine I couldn't marry her,
and I came right back.

1453
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:27,301
You... You...

1454
01:28:27,636 --> 01:28:28,636


1455
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,972
-Why didn't you call me?
-Because I was crazy enough

1456
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:32,640
to think that you would be waiting for me.

1457
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:36,310
Only when I arrived, they told me
you were off with some other guy.

1458
01:28:38,981 --> 01:28:43,359
So, Lorraine called me an idiot
and married me to prove it.

1459
01:28:43,485 --> 01:28:45,486
Sorry, can I just... Might I just butt in?

1460
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:47,571
Oh, Harry, don't... It's all right.
You don't have to.

1461
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:52,493
No, no, I just wanted to say it's great
to have even a third of Sophie.

1462
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:55,746
I never thought I'd get
even that much of a child.

1463
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:58,916
Donna, you were the first girl I ever loved.

1464
01:28:59,835 --> 01:29:03,129
Well, actually, you were
the last girl I ever loved.

1465
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:07,883
Now, this gives me an excuse
to come here much more often.

1466
01:29:07,968 --> 01:29:11,012
We can find out if you want,

1467
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:13,264
but I'm with Harry.

1468
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:17,977
-Being a third of your dad is great by me.
-By me, too.

1469
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:19,478
I'll take a third.

1470
01:29:19,563 --> 01:29:24,108
Typical, isn't it? You wait 20 years for a dad,
and then three come along at once.

1471
01:29:27,946 --> 01:29:29,071
Dearly beloved...

1472
01:29:29,156 --> 01:29:35,077
You know, I have no clue which one of you
is my dad, but I don't mind.

1473
01:29:35,746 --> 01:29:38,622
Now, I know what I really want.

1474
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:40,374
Sky, let's just not get married yet.

1475
01:29:40,459 --> 01:29:42,334
-What?
-What?

1476
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:45,755
You never wanted this anyway.

1477
01:29:45,839 --> 01:29:50,718
I know that. Let's just get off this island
and just see the world. Okay? All right?

1478
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:52,219
I love you.

1479
01:29:53,055 --> 01:29:55,139


1480
01:29:59,311 --> 01:30:02,521
Donna, do I take it the wedding
is canceled?

1481
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:05,775
I'm not entirely sure
what's happening right now.

1482
01:30:05,859 --> 01:30:07,443
Hang on.

1483
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:12,031
Why waste a good wedding?

1484
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:16,077
How about it, Sheridan?

1485
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:20,831
You're going to need someone
to boss around on this island of yours.

1486
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:26,337
Are you nuts? I am not a bigamist.

1487
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:31,509
Neither am I. I'm a divorced man
who's loved you for 21 years,

1488
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:35,554
and ever since the day
I set foot on this island,

1489
01:30:35,639 --> 01:30:38,808
I've been trying to tell you
how much I love you.

1490
01:30:43,855 --> 01:30:44,855


1491
01:30:45,148 --> 01:30:46,607


1492
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:51,195
Come on, Donna.
It's only the rest of your life.

1493
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,240


1494
01:30:54,324 --> 01:30:59,495
<i>I can't conceal it</i>
<i>Don't you see?</i>

1495
01:30:59,579 --> 01:31:02,331
<i>Can't you feel it?</i>

1496
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,876
Say I do

1497
01:31:05,961 --> 01:31:06,961
Oh, yeah.

1498
01:31:07,045 --> 01:31:12,007
<i>I do, I do, I do, I do, I do</i>

1499
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:16,762
<i>Donna, please show it</i>

1500
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:21,517
<i>You love me</i>
<i>And you know it</i>

1501
01:31:21,601 --> 01:31:24,186
<i>Say I do</i>

1502
01:31:26,231 --> 01:31:27,690
<i>I do</i>

1503
01:31:28,358 --> 01:31:31,402
I do, I do,

1504
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:34,864
I do, I do.

1505
01:31:41,121 --> 01:31:45,749
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1506
01:31:54,301 --> 01:31:55,926
I'm so happy!

1507
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:06,437


1508
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:22,286
<i>Here's to us</i>
<i>One more toast</i>

1509
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:26,874
<i>And then we'll pay the bill</i>

1510
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:30,586
<i>Deep inside both of us</i>

1511
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:34,840
<i>Could feel the autumn chill</i>

1512
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:38,719
<i>Birds of passage</i>
<i>You and me</i>

1513
01:32:38,803 --> 01:32:42,306
<i>We fly instinctively</i>

1514
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:46,602
<i>When the summer's over</i>

1515
01:32:46,686 --> 01:32:50,564
<i>And the dark clouds hide the sun</i>

1516
01:32:51,816 --> 01:32:55,444
<i>Neither you nor I'm to blame</i>

1517
01:32:55,528 --> 01:32:59,156
<i>When all is said and done</i>

1518
01:33:06,456 --> 01:33:09,875
<i>In our lives</i>
<i>We have walked</i>

1519
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:13,045
<i>Some strange and lonely treks</i>

1520
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:14,338
Yeah.

1521
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:16,423
<i>Slightly worn</i>

1522
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:18,300
<i>but dignified</i>

1523
01:33:18,385 --> 01:33:21,428
<i>And not too old for sex</i>

1524
01:33:21,513 --> 01:33:22,888
Yeah!

1525
01:33:22,973 --> 01:33:26,558
<i>Clear-headed and open-eyed</i>

1526
01:33:26,643 --> 01:33:30,020
<i>With nothing left untried</i>

1527
01:33:31,064 --> 01:33:35,276
<i>Standing calmly at the crossroads</i>

1528
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:38,279
<i>No desire to run</i>

1529
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:43,117
<i>There's no hurry anymore</i>

1530
01:33:43,201 --> 01:33:46,620
<i>When all is said and done</i>

1531
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:51,709
<i>Standing calmly at the crossroads</i>

1532
01:33:51,793 --> 01:33:54,586
<i>No desire to run</i>

1533
01:33:56,089 --> 01:33:59,466
<i>There's no hurry anymore</i>

1534
01:33:59,551 --> 01:34:03,846
<i>When all is said</i>

1535
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:06,557
<i>And done</i>

1536
01:34:13,606 --> 01:34:19,486
That's not for me. I'm a writer. Lone wolf.

1537
01:34:25,952 --> 01:34:28,412
<i>If you change your mind</i>

1538
01:34:33,084 --> 01:34:35,085
<i>I'm the first in line</i>

1539
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:40,758
<i>Honey, I'm still free</i>

1540
01:34:43,803 --> 01:34:46,347
<i>Take a chance on me</i>

1541
01:34:46,431 --> 01:34:47,723
Sorry.

1542
01:34:50,101 --> 01:34:53,562
<i>If you need me, let me know</i>

1543
01:34:53,646 --> 01:34:56,190
<i>I'm gonna be around</i>

1544
01:34:56,274 --> 01:34:59,109
<i>If you got no place to go</i>

1545
01:34:59,277 --> 01:35:01,195
<i>If you're feeling down</i>

1546
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:02,279
Speech!

1547
01:35:02,364 --> 01:35:04,031


1548
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:06,200
I'm gonna make a speech, everybody.

1549
01:35:06,284 --> 01:35:07,659
Yeah, get ready.

1550
01:35:07,744 --> 01:35:08,911


1551
01:35:08,995 --> 01:35:11,288


1552
01:35:11,831 --> 01:35:16,251
<i>If you're all alone</i>
<i>When the pretty birds have flown</i>

1553
01:35:16,336 --> 01:35:20,714
<i>Honey, I'm still free</i>
<i>Take a chance on me</i>

1554
01:35:20,799 --> 01:35:25,010
<i>Gonna do my very best</i>
<i>And it ain't no lie</i>

1555
01:35:25,095 --> 01:35:29,723
<i>If you put me to the test</i>
<i>If you let me try</i>

1556
01:35:29,808 --> 01:35:35,854
<i>Take a chance on me</i>

1557
01:35:35,939 --> 01:35:36,939
Go, Bill.

1558
01:35:38,983 --> 01:35:40,984
<i>We can go dancing</i>

1559
01:35:41,361 --> 01:35:45,447
<i>-We can go walking</i>
<i>-As long as we're together</i>

1560
01:35:47,992 --> 01:35:50,244
<i>Listen to some music</i>

1561
01:35:50,328 --> 01:35:52,204
<i>Maybe just talking</i>

1562
01:35:52,288 --> 01:35:54,748
<i>You'd get to know me better</i>

1563
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:59,253
<i>'Cause you know I've got</i>
<i>So much that I wanna do</i>

1564
01:35:59,337 --> 01:36:01,171
<i>When I dream I'm alone with you</i>

1565
01:36:01,256 --> 01:36:04,091
<i>It's magic</i>

1566
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:07,970
<i>-You want me to leave it there</i>
<i>-Afraid of a love affair</i>

1567
01:36:08,054 --> 01:36:12,433
<i>But I think you know</i>

1568
01:36:12,517 --> 01:36:15,853
<i>That I can't let go</i>

1569
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:20,315
<i>If you're all alone</i>
<i>When the pretty birds have flown</i>

1570
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:24,445
<i>Honey, I'm still free</i>
<i>Take a chance on me</i>

1571
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:28,824
<i>Gonna do my very best</i>
<i>And it ain't no lie</i>

1572
01:36:29,075 --> 01:36:30,451
<i>If you put me to the test</i>

1573
01:36:30,535 --> 01:36:31,577


1574
01:36:31,661 --> 01:36:36,123
<i>If you let me try</i>
<i>Take a chance on me</i>

1575
01:36:38,334 --> 01:36:41,837
<i>Take a chance on me</i>

1576
01:37:01,191 --> 01:37:05,903
It's Aphrodite!

1577
01:37:06,905 --> 01:37:09,490


1578
01:37:11,201 --> 01:37:14,203
<i>Mamma mia</i>
<i>Here I go again</i>

1579
01:37:14,287 --> 01:37:17,915
<i>My, my</i>
<i>How can I resist you?</i>

1580
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:21,585
<i>Mamma mia</i>
<i>Does it show again?</i>

1581
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:25,130
<i>My, my</i>
<i>Just how much I've missed you?</i>

1582
01:37:25,215 --> 01:37:28,550
<i>Yes, I've been broken-hearted</i>

1583
01:37:28,635 --> 01:37:32,095
<i>Blue since the day we parted</i>

1584
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:35,098
<i>Why, why</i>
<i>did I ever let you go?</i>

1585
01:37:35,183 --> 01:37:39,019
<i>Mamma mia</i>
<i>Now I really know</i>

1586
01:37:39,103 --> 01:37:43,357
<i>My, my</i>
<i>I should not have let you go</i>

1587
01:37:46,528 --> 01:37:48,362


1588
01:37:49,239 --> 01:37:52,699
<i>I have a dream</i>

1589
01:37:54,035 --> 01:37:56,787
<i>A song to sing</i>

1590
01:37:58,665 --> 01:38:03,377
<i>To help me cope</i>

1591
01:38:03,461 --> 01:38:06,463
<i>With anything</i>

1592
01:38:08,841 --> 01:38:12,636
<i>If you see the wonder</i>

1593
01:38:13,513 --> 01:38:16,807
<i>Of a fairy tale</i>

1594
01:38:18,309 --> 01:38:21,645
<i>You can take the future</i>

1595
01:38:23,106 --> 01:38:26,650
<i>Even if you fail</i>

1596
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:32,364
<i>I believe in angels</i>

1597
01:38:32,448 --> 01:38:37,244
<i>Something good in everything I see</i>

1598
01:38:37,328 --> 01:38:40,622
<i>I believe in angels</i>

1599
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,128
<i>When I know the time is right for me</i>

1600
01:38:46,254 --> 01:38:50,507
<i>I'll cross the stream</i>

1601
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:55,637
<i>I have a dream</i>

<i>Where they play the right music</i>

1614
01:39:59,327 --> 01:40:00,911
<i>Getting in the swing</i>

1615
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:03,747
<i>You come to look for a king</i>

1616
01:40:06,501 --> 01:40:10,629
<i>Anybody could be that guy</i>

1617
