1
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,880
<i># And every time it rains
# It rains pennies from heaven</i>

2
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,200
<i># Don't you know each cloud
# contains pennies from heaven?</i>

3
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,160
<i># You'll find your fortune falling</i>

4
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,800
<i># All over town</i>

5
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,040
<i># Be sure that your umbrella
# is up-up-up-up-upside down</i>

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,760
<i># And trade them for a package
# of sunshine and ravioli</i>

7
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,120
<i>Nice weather we're having, huh?</i>

8
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,240
<i>Here in the kingdom of Malaria,</i>

9
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,320
<i>every day's forecast is rainy
with a 100% chance of horror.</i>

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,960
<i>It wasn't always like this, though.</i>

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,320
<i>Years ago, Malaria was
a sunny land of farmers.</i>

12
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,680
<i>Until the mysterious storm clouds
rolled in and never left.</i>

13
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,280
<i>They killed our crops,
and our people became poor.</i>

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,040
<i>And that's when King Malbert...</i>

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,360
<i>thought up a new way
for us to make money,</i>

16
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,240
<i>Evil Inventions.</i>

17
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,240
<i>The kind that crush you, kill you,
bring you back to life,</i>

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,720
<i>then kill you again,
way worse.</i>

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,160
<i>We invent them, and the world
pays us not to unleash them.</i>

20
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,200
<i>Oh, It's a great gig, especially
if you're an Evil Scientist.</i>

21
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,280
<i>Fame, fortune,
a rent-free castle in the hills.</i>

22
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,520
<i>They get it all.
They're the top of the heap.</i>

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,520
Igor! Pull the switch!

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,000
Yes, Master!

25
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,960
<i>And the bottom of the heap?
Those are the poor slobs like me,</i>

26
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,040
<i>born with a hunch on our back, Igors.</i>

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,440
<i>Actually, that Igor's not me.</i>

28
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,000
Igor! Pull the switch!

29
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,240
Yes, Master!

30
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,360
<i>No, no, no,
that's not me, either.</i>

31
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,240
<i>That's me. See?
I look nothing like those other guys,</i>

32
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,720
<i>much better-looking.</i>

33
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,880
<i>Anyway, all Igors are forced
to serve Evil Scientists.</i>

34
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,160
<i>Our life is a permanent graveyard shift.</i>

35
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,520
<i>But I never wanted to be an Igor.</i>

36
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,200
<i>I always wanted to be
an Evil Scientist.</i>

37
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,120
<i>Unfortunately, the hunch on my
back was a one-way ticket</i>

38
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,560
<i>to Igor School.</i>

39
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,600
<i>I majored in Talking With a Slur
and graduated with a Yes Masters Degree.</i>

40
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,240
<i>Then, it was off to find a job.</i>

41
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,320
Hi, I'm here about the "Igor Wanted" ad.
My name's Igor.

42
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,680
Well, of course it is.
I've got a hunch on my back.

43
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,600
What's my name gonna be? Kevin?

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,880
<i>They didn't
appreciate my creative style.</i>

45
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,240
<i>But eventually, I landed a job
for Dr. Glickenstein.</i>

46
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,720
Pull the switch!

47
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,080
<i>Not the smartest scientist.</i>

48
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,000
<i>His last invention was an Evil Lasagna.</i>

49
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,720
<i>It didn't kill anyone.
And it actually tasted pretty good.</i>

50
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,880
Igor!

51
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,960
<i>Igors aren't allowed to invent,</i>

52
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,800
<i>but I still manage to work
on my own inventions in secret.</i>

53
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,600
<i>And this new one is gonna be
the one that proves</i>

54
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,400
<i>that I'm the biggest Evil Genius
of them all, and not just another...</i>

55
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,080
Igor!

56
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,000
<i>Once they see what I can do,
I'll have a whole new life,</i>

57
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,480
<i>and I'll never have to answer
to another master again.</i>

58
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,360
Sorry Master.
What did you say?

59
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,760
Oh! I mean...

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,400
Sorry, Master.
I was in the bathroom.

61
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,600
Had a bat stuck in the belfry,
if you know what I mean, Master.

62
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,600
I don't want to hear your
toilet memoirs, you cretin!

63
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,960
I give you five minutes a week
to take care of your business.

64
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,520
I'm not running a resort here!

65
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,720
Now get over there and...

66
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,440
Pull the switch!

67
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,680
Yes, Master!

68
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,640
Yes! Yes!

69
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,880
Yes!

70
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,880
Who's the failure now, Mother?

71
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,160
Mummy, Mummy, you were right!

72
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,880
I was never meant to be a scientist.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,120
I should have been a plumber like you!

74
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,280
That was the first time
he was right all day.

75
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,480
You! Go find me a 16-gigawatt
temporal transducer!

76
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,680
Excuse me, Master, are you sure
you don't mean 21-gigawatt?

77
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
You're correcting me?

78
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,320
Strike!

79
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,400
I should do more improv.

80
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,720
My hunch.

81
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,120
Oh, there she goes. Much better.

82
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,160
<i>Good evening, friends!</i>

83
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,480
<i>That's Scamper,
one of my most successful inventions.</i>

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,240
<i>I made him immortal.</i>

85
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,600
<i>Which is kind of a hassle for him,
since he doesn't want to live.</i>

86
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,440
Will nothing end this vicious cycle?

87
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,920
<i>I also made him talk.</i>

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,560
<i>Which is a hassle for me,
since he never shuts up.</i>

89
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,720
No fair!

90
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,680
You wasted your immortality formula
on the wrong guy, Igor.

91
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,040
<i>That's Brain, one
of my other inventions.</i>

92
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,480
<i>Legend has it when the smartest
man in the world died,</i>

93
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,440
<i>they put his brain in a jar.</i>

94
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,320
<i>This is not that brain.</i>

95
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,320
I wanna live forever!
I got plans! And dreams!

96
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,480
I got a squeaky wheel!
Was that me?

97
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,520
Really, Brain?

98
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,280
You want to be trapped in an
endless existential nightmare,

99
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,360
forced to keep living,

100
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,400
even though life is meaningless

101
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,720
and nothing matters?

102
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,120
Possibly.

103
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,920
What exactly did you say?

104
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,640
Too bad he wasted his intelligence
formula on me, too, Brain.

105
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,880
Or should I say "Brian"?

106
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,280
Hey! I was in a hurry!

107
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,480
Stupid permanent marker.

108
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,520
Enough.

109
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,960
The Evil Science Fair is in a week,

110
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,440
and Glickenstein is gonna lose again.

111
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,160
Okay, I get it.
You want me to fix his invention.

112
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,280
Now I'll just need a screwdriver,
some nails and my bag of marbles.

113
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,800
Don't touch his invention, Brain.

114
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,640
Fine! You don't want the
benefit of my brain power?

115
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,160
Then, farewell, Igor.

116
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,280
Like a gentle fawn,
I shall leave this meadow.

117
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,720
On second thought
maybe I'll stick around,

118
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,920
so I can watch Mr. Smarty-hunch

119
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,680
fix Glickenstein's invention.

120
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,960
I could! But you know
what would happen if I did!

121
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,840
The same thing he'd do if he
found out I invented you two.

122
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,360
He'd recycle me.

123
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,040
Can you imagine being chopped up
and used for body parts

124
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,600
and God knows what else?

125
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,880
Horrible.

126
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,280
Dang it!
Still here.

127
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,200
If I had my shot,

128
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,480
I could be one of the greatest
Evil Scientists Malaria has ever seen.

129
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,480
They'd all cheer my name

130
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,840
just like they do for the
great Dr. Schadenfreude!

131
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,600
And now your
master of disaster, the chief of grief,

132
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,240
a man who needs no introduction,

133
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,960
but who will brutally
torture me if he doesn't get one,

134
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,280
Dr. Schadenfreude!

135
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,160
Thank you thank you.
You're too kind

136
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,680
And I'm not.

137
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,200
But I want to welcome you all to my
annual pre-Evil Science Fair party.

138
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,520
My girlfriend Jaclyn.

139
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,560
You know, she may seem like

140
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,840
a shallow, conniving wretch...

141
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,720
That's all I got.
That pretty much sums her up.

142
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,920
A toast to the undefeated winner
of 17 Evil Science Fairs

143
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,000
and the greatest Evil
Genius in the world.

144
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,080
Bow for the King!

145
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,000
"The greatest Evil
Genius in the world. "

146
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,520
I remember when people
used to call me that.

147
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,160
Back when the clouds destroyed
our peaceful land of farmers,

148
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,000
and my plan to blackmail
the world saved us all

149
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,880
Yes, as you've told us all
over and over and over.

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,480
Yeah, well, here's more.

151
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,560
Did you know that years ago,
Schoddy's family name was Poekelmacher?

152
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,880
His family were pickle-makers.

153
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,160
So, what's your Evil Invention
this year, Doctor, kosher or dill?

154
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,200
I want to shove a pickle
right where the sun don't shine.

155
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,440
You mean Malaria, Master?

156
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,080
No matter how many
Evil Science Fairs I win,

157
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,000
I always have to bow
down to that idiot.

158
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,120
I will never get the respect he gets!

159
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,240
Respect? Respect isn't gonna
keep me in baby-seal boots.

160
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,000
You just need to keep on winning

161
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,440
Well, that is spoken
like a true worthless leech,

162
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,120
who, by the way still has not helped
me steal this year's winning invention.

163
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,280
You know, maybe if you
were a real scientist,

164
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,520
you wouldn't need
me to help you cheat every year.

165
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,800
Your whole lab is fake,

166
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,440
just like you.

167
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,000
And maybe I should throw you
back in the gutter where I found you!

168
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,400
You're one to talk,
Dr. Schadenfraude!

169
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,680
You don't have the guts.

170
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,680
Is Daddy still mad at me?

171
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,600
No.

172
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,480
But you and your friend Heidi

173
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,480
still have a little job to do.

174
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,960
Oh, we're trying.

175
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,440
Well, try a little bit harder!

176
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,200
Because this year,

177
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,160
I won't stop at just winning
the Evil Science Fair.

178
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,080
I'm gonna unleash my winning invention

179
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,840
on the King's smug little face,

180
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,120
and then he'll be the one
groveling at my feet!

181
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,320
Hi there.

182
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,320
Look, it's your
little girlfriend, Heidi.

183
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,600
You take a cocoa break,

184
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,520
and I'll guard your plans
for your new invention.

185
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,280
No, wait! You'll spill on my plans.

186
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,960
Heidi, you're not careful enough!

187
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,000
You're so sloppy sometimes.

188
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,840
Oh, poopshkin.

189
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,000
I went to the evil bookstore
and got you an inspirational poster.

190
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,840
It's a little kitten!

191
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,920
To remind you to always take time
in your day for a little torture.

192
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,040
My transducer!

193
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,600
Time to go.
I have no time for cocoa or kittens!

194
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,320
I have to work on my plans
alone and in secret.

195
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,480
In other words, bon voyage.

196
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,400
Who doesn't like tortured kittens?

197
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,760
I...
I like kittens.

198
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,840
I don't like dirty little hunchpeople.

199
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,640
Great, Schadenfreude's gonna kil me.

200
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,320
<i>And why are there two transducers?</i>

201
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,760
Master, the 21-gigawatt
might be somewhat safer, I think.

202
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,800
Think? Igors don't think.

203
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,760
I'm using the 16-gigawatt, you fool!

204
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,480
Now get over there and pull the switch!

205
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,760
What are you waiting for?

206
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,280
Yes, Master!

207
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,720
Yes! Yes!

208
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,960
Yes!

209
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,160
I told you the 16 would work, you Igor.

210
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,880
Behold my rocket ship!

211
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,160
Born to stream through the world,

212
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,520
unleashing pain and misery on everyone.

213
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,720
I named her after you, Mother.

214
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,840
Now to take the old
cow for a test drive.

215
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,600
No, Master!
The rocket is going to...

216
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,720
Uh... Yeah that.

217
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,000
Finally.

218
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,440
Now I can throw out that rug
in the foyer. That thing is hideous.

219
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,520
We were all thinking it.
I just said it.

220
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,320
Oh, no, who's that?
What am I gonna do?

221
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,960
Relax, this is Glickenstein's castle.

222
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,080
And he doesn't have
to open that door for anyone.

223
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,760
Open for the King!

224
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,160
Except for the King.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

225
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,960
He's here to see Glickenstein!
What do I tell him?

226
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,280
Tell him the truth.
And if he kills us,

227
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,760
I'll come back
and give you a beautiful funeral.

228
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,360
Right, right. The truth,
that's a good option. Right, right.

229
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,040
Glicky!
Glicky, my boy.

230
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,480
Where's Glicky?

231
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,760
Your Highness, he's gone.

232
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,960
Curse it, I need to see his invention.

233
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,600
Schadenfreude is getting too popular.

234
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,160
The people might make him king.

235
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,520
Someone has to beat him this year,

236
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,720
with an invention more evil than his.

237
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,440
Someone who can snatch
Schadenfreude's number one position

238
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,600
and rub his face in number two!

239
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,680
Ew...

240
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,000
Your Highness,
Dr. Glickenstein is...

241
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,040
creating life!

242
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,640
Did you say "life"?

243
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,680
Yes.

244
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,440
Thinking, breathing life that can
destroy freely all on its own.

245
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,160
No Evil Scientist has ever
been able to create life

246
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,960
Oh, sure they've mutated life.

247
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
They've ended life.

248
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,320
They've blasted life into
a million gooey pieces.

249
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,120
But created life?

250
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,200
A weapon like that would be
the greatest Evil Invention of all time.

251
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,800
And its inventor the
greatest Evil Scientist of all time?

252
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,080
Of course!
This is what I've been waiting for.

253
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,800
And it's your job to make sure
nothing happens to Glickenstein,

254
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,040
or I'll throw
you down the recycling chute

255
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,720
and use your hunch as a speed bump!

256
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,600
Oh, this is big.
Schadenfreude's winning streak is over.

257
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,920
Come on boys!
Let's go kick some old people.

258
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,000
Ow! What is wrong with you?

259
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,520
That's for having a death wish.
That's my thing.

260
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,640
I am not gonna die, Scamper.

261
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,440
For the first time ever,

262
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,320
I'm gonna live!

263
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,240
I sometimes come down here to think.

264
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,520
Wow, how interesting.

265
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,120
What's next?
You're gonna pull out a guitar

266
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,440
and play us a song you wrote
in college about being misunderstood?

267
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,880
I know, right?
And she's not even done yet.

268
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,760
<i>Baby, baby, it looks
like it's gonna hail</i>

269
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,480
<i>Baby, baby, it looks
like it's gonna hail</i>

270
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,040
<i>You better come inside</i>

271
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,800
<i>Let me teach you how to jive and wail</i>

272
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,800
Come on, bigger.
Do it. Come on, make it bigger.

273
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,640
Bigger!

274
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,120
Okay to the left. Very good.
Now back to the right.

275
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,200
No, no, no!

276
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,880
To the left, now back to the right.
To the right. To the right.

277
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,760
Is that even her hand?

278
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,280
And now to make her
skin indestructible.

279
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,600
<i>You gotta jump, jive,
and then you wail</i>

280
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,720
<i>You gotta jump, jive,
and then you wail</i>

281
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,080
<i>You gotta jump, jive,
and then you wail</i>

282
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,280
Did you see that?
Shoot him again.

283
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,560
And now, the crucial last piece,

284
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,560
the source of all, the Monster's power,

285
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,720
the Evil Bone.

286
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,440
I have to hurry.
It loses its power in the light.

287
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,600
That's it.

288
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,840
Only one thing left to do.

289
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,000
He said "do. "

290
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,280
Pull the switch!

291
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,320
Do not yell at me.

292
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,000
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just...

293
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,000
Pull the switch.

294
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,560
Please pull the switch.

295
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,600
That's better.

296
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Why does he get to pull the switch?

297
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,400
Because I'm not an idiot, Brian.

298
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,440
My name is not Brian!

299
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,840
Then you must have his jar.

300
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,120
Stop! You can both pull the switch.

301
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,200
On the count of three. One.

302
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,520
Hey! No fair!
You said we could both pull the...

303
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,440
Rise!

304
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,320
Rise!

305
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
I...

306
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,640
I don't believe it.

307
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,160
I'm a failure.
I'm a...

308
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,400
I'm an Igor.

309
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,440
Get rid of that thing.

310
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,400
I never want to see it again.

311
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,320
Funny you should say that.

312
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,680
Uh... Igor? Yeah.
Where did the monster go?

313
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,720
I don't know, Brain.

314
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,240
May I suggest looking behind you?

315
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,880
It was just a suggestion.

316
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,840
Maybe it just spontaneously combusted?

317
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,640
Oh, yeah sure.
I've read about that in...

318
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,160
Who am I kidding?
I can't read!

319
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,040
And just like that she
was out of their lives.

320
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,920
I did it. I...

321
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,040
I created life.

322
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,720
Has that hole always been there?

323
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,120
Come on!

324
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,440
Let me get this straight

325
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,760
We are chasing after the
bloodthirsty monster?

326
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,240
"Home For Blind Orphans. "

327
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,160
Oh God, she's killing blind orphans!

328
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,640
That's so evil!
I mean, which is great, but...

329
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,440
Blind orphans!

330
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,120
I wanna go next.

331
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,400
Me, me, pick me!

332
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,640
I wonder what diabolical deed
she has planned next.

333
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,680
Piggyback rides?

334
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,960
It's my turn!
I wanna go next!

335
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,795
I wanna go next!

336
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,320
Me! Me! Pick me!
Me! Me!

337
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,440
Blind orphans get everything!

338
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,800
Ah

339
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,800
Your very large friend is a sweetheart.

340
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,320
No, she's not.

341
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,120
I am your master,
and I command you

342
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,440
to stop this gesture
of goodwill right now

343
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,120
and put them down.

344
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,920
Down!

345
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,800
Okay, now you're gonna
march right back to

346
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,120
the castle, got it?

347
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,280
Oh, he's dead!

348
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,080
Those are paper flowers
the orphans sell.

349
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,880
Sounds like someone likes them.

350
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,520
You touch it,
you buy it!

351
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,680
Master!

352
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,240
I looked inside Dr Glickenstein's castle

353
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,640
and didn't see anyone.

354
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,080
But that's not all...

355
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,560
Yes, it is,
because your voice is annoying.

356
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,720
Now, to break into
Glickenstein's castle

357
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,960
and steal the plans
like Heid failed to do.

358
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,560
What did this?

359
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm guessing something big.
Something like this.

360
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,160
Life? Glickenstein invented ife?

361
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,040
I don't think he had a hand in it.

362
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,240
Well, if he's toast,

363
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,400
who invented that?

364
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,240
I don't believe it.

365
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,480
Wow,

366
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,040
so not only is every other
Evil Scientist smarter than you,

367
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,040
and Igor is, too?

368
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,120
Ouch!

369
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,560
Smart is not mouthing off

370
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,240
to the man who has just found
his way to take the throne.

371
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,600
<i>Oh, baby, won't you please come home?</i>

372
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,680
<i>'Cause your little daddy's
gonna be all alone</i>

373
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,280
She must be making a club
of flowers to smash us with.

374
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,840
This must be very
embarrassing for you.

375
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,120
<i>I never thought that we could part</i>

376
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,720
<i>For every hour in the day
you can hear me say</i>

377
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,280
<i>Baby, won't you please come home?
I need you, I need you</i>

378
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,560
Okay clearly her
Evil Bone wasn't activated

379
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,560
when she came to life. That's it.

380
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,040
Ooh! I have an idea!

381
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,120
Is it about this situation?

382
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,480
No.

383
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,200
Is it even an idea?

384
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,840
Is French fries an idea?

385
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,480
So, how do you activate it?

386
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,480
We need to kick-start it.

387
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,640
We need to get her to
commit one act of evil.

388
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,680
She wouldn't hurt a fly.

389
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,240
Okay. Monster,

390
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,600
I command you to kill that fly.

391
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,960
Kill it! Kill it!

392
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,560
Kill it, girl!
Come on! You're a killer!

393
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,320
Maim it! Wound it! Insult it!

394
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,960
Something!
Kill it! Kill it!

395
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,600
Kill, kill, kill!

396
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,840
You were saying?

397
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,200
No, no, no!
You're evil!

398
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,800
Evil!

399
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,960
Evil!

400
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,120
E...

401
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
Eva.

402
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,840
What? No, you're not Eva.

403
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,400
Eva. Eva.

404
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,800
What now, genius?

405
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,640
Well, thank you for asking.
What we're going to do...

406
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,120
Go soak your brain, Brian.

407
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,400
That's actually not a bad idea.

408
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,120
Monster want a brain wash?

409
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,960
Next!

410
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,040
Hi, I'd like to...

411
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,880
Hey, who you talking to?
I'm the head guy here!

412
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,440
Oh, excuse me. Sorry.

413
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,880
What the heck is that?

414
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,200
It's my Aunt Eva.

415
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,000
She's getting a little
sweet in her old age

416
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,080
so I'd like to,
I don't know, evil her up a bit.

417
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,560
"Sunday Night Massacre. " No.
"Arsonist. "

418
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,240
Gee, they all look so good.

419
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,440
How about the "Axe Murderer" brain wash?

420
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,600
Oh! She must be very special to you.

421
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,400
Hey! Don't touch that!
It s a very complicated system!

422
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,160
One wrong button and you'll just
be watching regular cable

423
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,640
You wanna waste your
nephew's money like that? Huh? Huh?

424
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,520
Gosh I feel like I'm sending my kid

425
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,160
off to school for the first time.

426
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,600
You know, to learn how to murder.

427
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,600
Hi. How are you?
Great wings.

428
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,200
Listen, could you squeeze me in
for a brain wash, too?

429
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,160
A nice thorough scrubbing.

430
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,680
What are you?
An imbecile?

431
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,080
<i>Oh, parlez Italian?
Taco grande to meet you.</i>

432
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,880
Yeah. Take Brian to Room Number 4.

433
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,880
"Wish you weren't there.

434
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,160
"This card teleports your enemy to you
so you can destroy him in person. "

435
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,320
Call me old-fashioned,

436
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,480
but what happened to cards
that just blew your head off?

437
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,040
Just think Scamper.
In a few short moments,

438
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,280
I'm gonna have the most
Evil Invention of all time.

439
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,240
It's my whole life savings,
but I think I'm going to treat myself.

440
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,440
Oh, my hunch.

441
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,000
"Happy Mother's Day. '

442
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,240
See, that's what I'm talking about.
Simple, elegant, classic.

443
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,920
You've seen a lot of brains I'm sure.

444
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,760
Mine's bigger than average, right? No?

445
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,920
Hello? Can you even talk?

446
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,680
Canadians.
I'll just watch TV.

447
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,040
Whoops!

448
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,560
Butterfingers.

449
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,040
Oh. Great. Hold on.

450
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,480
And it's cold, it's cold,
it's cold, it's cold, it's cold.

451
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,200
<i>Hey, Monster,
can I borrow your remote?</i>

452
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,880
Thank you.

453
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,840
Oh, come on!

454
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,160
<i>Let's do the twist
Around and around and around</i>

455
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,640
Stupid remote!

456
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,680
<i>To plumb the depths of
Blanche DuBois in Streetcar</i>

457
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,240
<i>is the ultimate challenge
for any modern actress.</i>

458
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,440
Well, our evil bun should be
out of the oven soon.

459
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,680
Estephan, you're a magician!

460
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,120
What's that smell?

461
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,320
My new air freshener,
"Dead Dog. " Jealous?

462
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,720
I don't hear anything.

463
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,160
I think it worked.

464
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,880
Maybe they did too much?

465
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,240
Oh. Was it?

466
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,720
Was I too much?
I was pushing, wasn't I?

467
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,240
It was only a vocal exercise,
but that is a beginner's mistake

468
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,120
I have to own that.
That's just where I am.

469
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,920
If only I knew whether
I had the "it" factor.

470
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,760
But how can you know?
I mean, you can't learn that,

471
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,520
you just have to be born with it.

472
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,120
Oh listen to me going on
and on about me me, me.

473
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,080
Let's talk about you, Igor.
Do you think I have "it"?

474
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,160
<i>Let's thank our guest who
has taught us in one hour,</i>

475
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,160
<i>a lifetime worth of lessons in acting.</i>

476
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,560
Acting?

477
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,280
Who changed the channel?

478
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,320
Wait, where's the remote?

479
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,240
Move it!
I need this room.

480
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,560
No, no, no. Wait!
We need to unbrainwash her!

481
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,400
No can do, pal.

482
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,040
Every wash comes with a sealant
guaranteed to last a lifetime.

483
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,160
In other words, buzz off!

484
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,320
Okay, things to do,
sign up for yoga classes

485
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,960
get new headshots, adopt children
from all over the world.

486
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,840
Oh! time for my elocution exercises.

487
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,720
I need a box of biscuits.
I need a box of biscuits.

488
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,560
It's just failure after failure.

489
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,320
After failure,
after failure...

490
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,000
Oh, sorry, I thought we were
counting off all your failures.

491
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,480
Biscuit mixer, a box of mix...

492
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,560
A box of mixed biscuits
and a biscuit mixer.

493
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,080
I need a box...

494
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,440
Stop the carriage!

495
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,080
Ow!

496
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,160
What? What's the matter?

497
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,360
I don't mean to be a prima donna,
but I think I need a bigger trailer.

498
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,800
After failure, after
failure, after failure...

499
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,400
After failure, after failure...

500
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,680
That monster is about to be mine.

501
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,640
Oh, really? How?

502
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,680
Well, with a little something I
just stole for the occasion, okay?

503
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,880
Practice poses for the red carpet,

504
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,680
become an environmentalist,
but still fly private when necessary.

505
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,600
A Shrink, Ray? Oh, that's a genius'
plan for stealing a monster.

506
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,520
Hey! I don't come down
to where you work and...

507
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,760
Oh, that's right, you don't work!
So shut your cake hole, darling!

508
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,920
Now to shrink Igor
and steal his monster.

509
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,200
Oh, God. Did I hit it?
Did I hit it? I hope I didn't hit it!

510
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,280
You, sir, put the
"Evil" in "Evil Scientist. "

511
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,560
Here we go.

512
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,560
What the...?

513
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,760
Hold on! Pull over.
I'm getting jar sick!

514
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,320
Someone's trying to shoot us!

515
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,320
Paparazzi! Why can't those
vultures leave me a one?

516
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,760
This has totally
ruined my spa day.

517
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,800
To the right!

518
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,720
To the right!

519
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,800
This is the worst
car service I have ever used!

520
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,600
Now I get to watch you die.

521
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,720
Hold on!

522
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,720
Brake. Brake!

523
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,800
Uh-oh!

524
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,200
Put the brake on, you...

525
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Okay.

526
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,120
Fire the rocket booster!

527
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,320
I can't see who it is!

528
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,400
Here I come!

529
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,400
Oh! My beautiful face.

530
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,120
No more Doctor. Don't Kill Anybody!

531
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,600
We're not gonna make it!
We're not gonna make it!

532
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,880
If only you'd made
yourself indestructible!

533
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,800
Indestructible.
Indestructible.

534
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,320
Who wants to be a big movie star?

535
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,240
Me! Me! I do.

536
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,360
This would be the right time
to curb your suicidal tendencies.

537
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,160
BRAIN
Hey! I can see my room from here.

538
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,400
Go away! Look,
I'm very important.

539
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,560
Ew! What's that smell?

540
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,760
Oh, yes, wait, it is the big,
whopping stench of failure.

541
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,880
Ironically, at an inch tall, you still
have the biggest mouth in Malaria.

542
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,640
Thank you.

543
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,040
You're very welcome.

544
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,960
You saved my life.

545
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,840
As an actor, I feel things very deeply,
and I treasure all of life.

546
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,400
FIY, it is actually me
you should thank.

547
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,760
I was the one who changed the
channel on her brain wash.

548
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,760
- What?
- Yep,

549
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,800
and if she had been evil,
she would have let us all die.

550
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,120
So technically,
I'm the one who saved us.

551
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,320
But no need to thank me.

552
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,600
Actually, a "thank you" would be nice.

553
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,280
It could be in the form of
a card or a poem, your choice.

554
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,000
I a so like ponies.

555
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,720
An axe?

556
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,800
I don't want an axe. That's crazy.

557
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,000
Why would you offer me an axe?

558
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,680
You made my monster an actress!

559
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,080
This is why people
are afraid of hunchbacks!

560
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,480
This. Right here!

561
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,040
Oh! What play are they rehearsing?

562
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,240
<i>Brain-Dead.</i>

563
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,120
Don't let him kill me!
It's gonna be a smash.

564
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,320
Don't let him kill me!

565
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,160
The only thing killed here is my dream.

566
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,080
Bravo! Bravo!

567
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,120
Huh?

568
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,440
Oh, you guys are so lucky to have work.

569
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,840
If only I had a role I could
really sink my teeth into.

570
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,280
Eva, you're in luck.

571
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,280
In four days, there is
an audition for the lead

572
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,520
in the biggest play
to hit Malaria since...

573
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,760
<i>The Desperate Hunchback
Who Grasped at Straws?</i>

574
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,280
Seriously, Eva,
this could be your big break!

575
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,440
Oh, my gosh! I don't believe it!
What play is it?

576
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,720
Play? What play is it?

577
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,000
<i>Is it Annie?</i>

578
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,840
<i>Annie?</i>

579
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,280
So many terrific girls
got their start playing Annie.

580
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,560
<i>Yes, that's it!
It's Annie!</i>

581
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,560
So it's actually a musical?

582
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,000
I think I just wet myself.

583
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,680
Someone can sing!

584
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,000
<i>Gosh! Me trying out for Annie,</i>

585
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:14,400
the plucky orphan whose song of hope
lifts the heart of a weary nation?

586
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,880
Yeah. Except in this version,
Annie goes nuts

587
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,640
and battles a bunch of Evil Inventions

588
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,680
in deadly hand-to-hand combat.

589
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,240
Wow. How avant-garde.

590
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,480
Yeah. Trust me.
You were born to be in this production.

591
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:32,720
<i>The sun'll come out tomorrow</i>

592
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,800
<i>Bet your...</i>

593
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,800
No, you missed it, again.

594
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,400
Excuse me, Igor, but I think
you're supposed to say "cut. "

595
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,640
That's for film.

596
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,680
Film?

597
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,000
Can you imagine a face
like that on a 40-foot screen?

598
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,880
All right, all right.
Now, listen, Eva...

599
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,040
Excuse me, Igor,
I'm a little distracted.

600
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,240
What?

601
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,000
I think the makeup girl
is out to get me.

602
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,200
No, that's Brain. And he's not
the makeup girl, he's the idiot.

603
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,640
Now try to remember
on the word "tomorrow,"

604
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,160
you re supposed to crush the
Evil Invention to your left!

605
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,960
You mean "stage left. "

606
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,120
Yeah, whatever. You're supposed
to smash it to smithereens.

607
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,760
I know, it's just...

608
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,120
It looks kind of real, and
it's hard because I would

609
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,240
never hurt anything real

610
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,320
The props at the audition

611
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,800
are gonna look even more real, Eva.

612
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,800
Some may even scream
when you smash them.

613
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,960
Oh, really?

614
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,800
Yes. And they're also
going to fight back.

615
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,240
But it's all for reality's sake.

616
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,760
But if you don't want
to be a real actress...

617
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,840
Oh, no, no.
I do, I do.

618
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,120
This is a block for me
but I will get through it.

619
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,720
Once more, from the top,
with feeling.

620
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,160
I just have a teeny,
teeny, tiny suggestion.

621
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,360
Now, I know I m not the director
but at the end of the number,

622
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,240
I would love to try
something like this...

623
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:47,400
<i>You're only a day</i>

624
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,160
<i>Away</i>

625
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,840
Works for me.

626
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,720
<i>Dr. Igor.
Dr. Igor von Igorstein.</i>

627
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,520
<i>No, no, no. The Evil Revered
Igor von Igorstein III.</i>

628
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,720
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

629
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,280
<i>I might actually be
able to pull this off.</i>

630
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,840
Good work today, Eva.
You took some really...

631
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,240
big steps.

632
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,880
Thank you, Igor.

633
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,400
I'm whispering to protect my voice.

634
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,120
I really couldn't
have done it without you.

635
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,560
Isn't it beautiful?

636
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,040
King Malbert has turned
this country into a paradise.

637
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,080
His tower shines out for all the world
to see as a beacon of evil.

638
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,880
And that's a good thing?

639
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,080
We were a nothing country
until King Malbert taught us

640
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,240
that the way to succeed
is by doing evil.

641
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,360
Phew!

642
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,960
This is a tough town.

643
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,840
Well, in this world,
nice guys finish last.

644
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,000
So, I have to step on
people to get ahead?

645
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,040
Uh...

646
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,160
Yeah.

647
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,760
Well, I'd rather be a
good nobody than an evil somebody.

648
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,640
And so would you.
Because you're good, Igor.

649
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,720
Eva, don't say that.

650
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,440
It's true.
You are good.

651
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,720
Seriously, stop saying that!

652
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,920
But you are!
You've helped me with my audition.

653
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,160
You've made me this delicious tea.

654
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,480
You're a very good friend.

655
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,200
Evil Scientists don't have friends.

656
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,200
Well, what are Brain and Scamper?

657
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,280
Headaches.

658
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,360
Oh!

659
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,240
Is that all I am?

660
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,280
No.

661
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,160
Okay. Then you can be
my number two friend.

662
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,400
Number two friend.
Well, who's your number one friend?

663
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,560
See? You're jealous.

664
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,280
You do wanna be my friend.

665
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,120
I guess I'm just a pushover.

666
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,800
<i>Hi, welcome to Cristall Clear.
I'm Carl Cristall.</i>

667
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,360
Tonight, we have a very special guest,
someone we all love and respect.

668
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,160
It's Honkers the Gassy Monkey.
But first, King Malbert.

669
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,600
You're not wearing
any, you know, pants.

670
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,640
Hmm?

671
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,040
Oh, no, I'm not.

672
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,040
I figure, why does an
invisible man need to wear pants?

673
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,560
It's very liberating,
Your Highness.

674
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,640
Sire, the clouds,

675
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,400
were they a blessing or a curse?

676
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,440
Well, of course, I would never
wish the clouds on my people.

677
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,200
But we rallied together
for the common good

678
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,880
by embracing evil,
and look at us now!

679
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,760
Respected, successful.

680
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,920
What are you doing?

681
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,120
Scratching my invisible...

682
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,320
But getting back to my
next question, sire.

683
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,000
The Evil Science Fair is two days away.

684
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,280
Any predictions?
Can anyone beat Dr. Schadenfreude?

685
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,520
Well, I hate to predict.

686
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,320
I mean, all the Evil Scientists
are twisted fiends in their own right.

687
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,200
That said, there may
be a genius this year

688
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,600
with an Evil Invention so revolutionary

689
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,880
that Schadenfreude might finally
get knocked off his perch!

690
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,360
The only one getting
knocked off his perch is you!

691
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,160
Damn it, I need that monster!

692
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,520
I will not be beaten

693
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,680
by a hunchbacked
pot-bellied, bulgy-eyed runt.

694
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,600
I think he's kind of cute.
Talent is attractive.

695
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,400
I can just picture Igor
and his monster now,

696
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,840
plotting their deadly combat maneuvers.

697
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,960
<i># I got a woman as big
# as a house, yes, sir</i>

698
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,360
<i># She's as big as a two-family
# house with a porch and a fence</i>

699
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,960
<i># You won't believe what you see
# when you look at her</i>

700
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,720
<i># She's enormous, colossal,
# tremendous, gigantic, immense</i>

701
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,360
<i># Why try to deny it?
# She's just what I like.</i>

702
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,680
<i># If she goes on a diet</i>

703
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,120
<i># I'll go on strike.</i>

704
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,600
<i># The bigger the figure
# The better I like her</i>

705
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,440
<i># The better I like her
# The better I feed her</i>

706
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,160
<i># The better I feed her
# The bigger the figure</i>

707
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,880
<i># The bigger the figure
# The more I can love</i>

708
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,280
<i># She's exactly like a watermelon</i>

709
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,600
<i># Big and round and sweet</i>

710
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,280
<i># And in a party dress
# She may be quite a mess</i>

711
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,040
<i># But I love her a lot
# So what if she's not</i>

712
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:25,880
<i># so neat?</i>

713
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,720
<i># The bigger the figure</i>

714
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,400
<i># The better I like her</i>

715
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,240
<i># The better I like her</i>

716
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,000
<i># The better I feed her</i>

717
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,120
<i># The better I feed her
# The bigger the figure</i>

718
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,120
<i># The bigger the figure
# The more I can love</i>

719
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,480
<i># If she ever</i>

720
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,320
<i># Eats me out of money</i>

721
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,640
<i># And we needed the rent</i>

722
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,200
<i># Oh, that'll be a cinch
# 'Cause when we're in a pinch</i>

723
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,920
<i># I can put her to work
# under a circus tent</i>

724
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,920
<i># The bigger the figure
# The better I like her</i>

725
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,800
<i># The better I like her
# The better I feed her</i>

726
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,800
<i># The better I feed her
# The bigger the figure</i>

727
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,520
<i># The bigger the figure
# The more I can love</i>

728
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,640
Guys, can you come in here?

729
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,960
I need to talk to you.

730
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,480
If she's having a woman problem
it's all yours.

731
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,320
Ta-da!

732
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,040
What are these?

733
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,920
Opening night presents.

734
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,440
I know it's technically
just an audition tomorrow,

735
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,720
but I figured "What the hey?"

736
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,720
They're not much, since I had
to use stuff I found around here

737
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,000
but, well...
You first, Brain!

738
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,640
An envelope!
You spoil me rotten, lady.

739
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,680
I think we better open it.

740
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,240
It's a new label for your jar.

741
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,400
And Brain is spelled right!

742
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,560
It is, right?

743
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,680
You shouldn't really worry
about labels, though,

744
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,000
because you may be a brain,
but you have heart.

745
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,240
And in some ways,
that's more important.

746
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,040
Heart? I'd kill for a pair of feet.

747
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,960
Open yours, Scamper.
It s a prehistoric evergreen.

748
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,480
They live forever.
I just want to make sure

749
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,840
that if anything
ever happens to the three of us,

750
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,080
you always have company.

751
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,080
Great. I must be allergic to it.

752
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,640
With any luck, it'll kill me
with its dinosaur-era toxins.

753
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,600
Can we move on to Igor now?

754
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,360
No one's ever given me a gift before.

755
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,160
It's something no
director can be without.

756
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,520
A beret!

757
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,160
Voil!

758
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,480
That's French for,

759
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,200
"Please stop pelting me and
my ridiculous hat with rocks. "

760
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,720
Hey, Igor where's our gift for Eva?

761
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,040
Our gift?

762
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,960
Oh! You guys didn't.

763
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,200
We did.

764
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,000
Where'd you put it, Igor?

765
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,960
It s in the other room.

766
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,880
Gift, gift, gift, gift.

767
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,520
Eva. Well, we got you this.

768
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,240
It's a necklace.

769
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,800
It's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen!

770
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,720
Igor, can you...

771
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,880
I would do it myself,
but I am all thumbs.

772
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,200
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
I got the thumbs on sale.

773
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,240
I'm never gonna take this off.

774
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,600
That way all of you will be
close to my heart forever.

775
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,040
I need to go write this down
in my sense-memory journal!

776
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,240
Oh, where did I put my glitter pen?

777
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,680
See, this is the kind of
moment that'd be tough

778
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,840
for someone who wasn't meant
to be an Evil Scientist.

779
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,440
Somebody who'd go all soft
and want to tell her the truth.

780
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,120
But lucky for us, I'm evil, right?

781
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,880
Yeah. Lucky us.

782
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,520
I don't feel lucky.

783
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,200
So we stay on track,
'cause we're almost there,

784
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,000
and I just don't let
her get into my head.

785
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,160
It s so hard being a little hunchback.

786
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,360
Heidi!

787
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,240
Dr. Glickenstein is under the rug.
I mean, under the weather.

788
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,240
I didn't come to see him.

789
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,960
I came to see you.

790
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,720
Me?

791
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:48,080
By the way, an Igor came by today

792
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,840
and asked me to
hands-deliver this to you.

793
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,080
And these are my hands.

794
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,080
What? What is it?

795
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,000
<i>Ja, I haven't any idea.</i>

796
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,640
"Wish You Weren't There. "

797
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,000
Oh, excellent, wonderful.

798
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,920
You got my card.

799
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,000
Is everything okay?

800
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,040
I heard a strange noise.

801
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,080
Ooh!

802
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,440
Oh, I wasn't at the door
listening to you and Igor.

803
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,800
I just...

804
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,720
Hi! We haven't met. I'm Eva.

805
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,160
Oh you're upset, aren't you?

806
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,080
"Who is this strange woman
living with Igor," right?

807
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,720
Well, believe me,
Igor and I are just friends.

808
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,360
As his girlfriend you have
nothing to worry about.

809
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,040
I'm not his girlfriend.

810
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,320
You're not?

811
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,480
But the way he looks at you...

812
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,400
He never looks at me that way.

813
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,480
Maybe some men like girls

814
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,240
who don't look like they've
been put together at the junkyard.

815
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,880
Right.

816
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,600
You have a very ugly face.

817
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,200
Well, I have to go
get some rest for my audit on tomorrow.

818
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,560
It was nice meeting you.

819
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,640
Oh.

820
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,960
Whoops!

821
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,000
Audit on?

822
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,840
So, how's your cocktail, Igor?

823
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,840
Is it nice? You like t?

824
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,880
Is it coconut-ty?
Coconut-ty enough?

825
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Wait! You should be sipping in style!

826
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,560
Igor Krazy Straw!
Right now.

827
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,240
Small trumpet. Isn't that better?
Doesn't that taste better?

828
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,280
Excuse me, sir, but why...

829
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,600
I mean, why am I here?

830
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,480
You can drop that slur around me.

831
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,560
I don't even make my Igors talk
that way. Isn't that right, Igor?

832
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,200
Oh, that's right, Master.

833
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,960
How many times do I have to tell you?

834
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,440
Call me Frederick.
Okay? That's my name.

835
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,360
Okay. Frederick!

836
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,640
I have to get back.
Dr. Glickenstein will be missing me.

837
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,920
Somehow, I think he's missing
more than his right-hand man.

838
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:03,800
Look, Iggy baby I know all about
Glickenstein and his deadness.

839
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,120
I also know about your monster.

840
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,440
I m gonna guess your plan.

841
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,160
You win the Evil Science Fair,

842
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,640
and then everyone looks
past the hunch thing,

843
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,560
and they accept you for the real you.

844
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,200
You grab the girl of your dreams
and you cha-cha-cha your way

845
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,360
to a happy ending.

846
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,480
Am I close on this?

847
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,960
No, not entirely.

848
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,760
I don't know how to cha-cha.

849
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,840
We're a lot alike, Igor.

850
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,920
I want to be more as well,

851
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,360
but society, it won't let me.
It stops me.

852
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,480
So, this is my plan:

853
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,680
I enter Evil Science Fair
with your monster and then I win.

854
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,840
I turn the monster on the King.

855
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,360
Ding dong, the King is dead,
long live the new king, me!

856
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:49,800
And then you come in as Malaria's
new Evil Scientist Dr. Igor.

857
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,960
So what do you say to
that? Is that nice?

858
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:52,840
Is that really nice?

859
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,640
You want to overthrow the King?

860
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,040
I thought you wanted
to be an Evil Scientist.

861
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,080
I do. But...

862
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,800
Stop thinking like an Igor!

863
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,080
Evil Scientists do not let
anyone stand in their way.

864
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,880
Yes. I know. They step
on people to get ahead.

865
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,120
Exactly!

866
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:08,960
She'll never do it.

867
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:09,960
She?

868
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,240
The monster.
She isn't evil.

869
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,800
Something went wrong and her
Evil Bone was never activated.

870
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,000
So how do we get this Evil Bone
up and running, huh?

871
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,880
We kick it, we slap it,
we take it to the movies, call it Irene?

872
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,680
She needs to commit an evil act,

873
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,360
but since she's not evil, she won't.

874
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,880
Well, your troubles are over then,

875
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,320
because I can get a woman
to do absolutely anything.

876
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,840
I don't know.

877
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,240
Don't tell me that you have
feelings for this thing?

878
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,680
- No.
- Good,

879
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,640
because that would be pathetic.

880
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,920
I can give you everything
you have ever wanted.

881
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,400
I think I need to go.

882
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,920
Look, the Evil Science Fair
is in a few hours.

883
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,800
You're either with me or against me.

884
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,000
Yes or no?

885
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,160
I take that as a no.

886
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,840
What are you going to do now, smart guy?

887
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,200
Oh!

888
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,320
No!

889
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,640
Frederick!

890
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,040
Frederick! Why are you swimming?

891
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,720
You just ate 10 minutes ago.

892
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,480
Get off of me, you buffoon!

893
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,480
Okay,
we finished your costume.

894
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,760
I just hope it's cinched
enough at the waist.

895
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,000
Obviously, if I had more time,
I would have made it flare out

896
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,320
a little bit more over the knees.

897
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,480
Stop touching it, Brain,
I'm creating a look here.

898
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,440
You guys are my friends.
So, you'll tell me the truth, right?

899
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,080
Yeah, sure.

900
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,360
Do you think I'm pretty?

901
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,680
Brain, get me a tub of eye-liner,
a pound of lipstick,

902
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,360
and if all else fails,
the severed head of a supermodel.

903
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,200
Okay, the Jacuzzi is not a bathroom.

904
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,040
I know that now.

905
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,760
Please, please take your own
sweet time! I'm loving it here!

906
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,280
Oh, really?

907
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,120
Well, then maybe you
should stay down there

908
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,640
with your Igor, poopshkin!

909
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,880
You know something?
He's a good listener,

910
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,840
he's got soft hands, and unlike you,
he sometimes shaves his legs!

911
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,320
Wait.
No kissing Heidi.

912
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,480
Or do you like me better as Heidi?

913
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:12,360
Hmm. Jaclyn, Heidi, Jaclyn, Heidi.

914
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,760
It would be really swell

915
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,320
if you didn't go
psycho-girlfriend on me right now.

916
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,240
I'm not psycho!

917
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,320
Obviously not.

918
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:25,480
How would you feel if every day
you had to be 13 different people?

919
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,080
I'm Jaclyn, your girlfriend.

920
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,480
Then I'm Dr. Nachtmahrs girlfriend.

921
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,840
Then I'm Dr. Groaner's girlfriend.

922
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,480
All for you!

923
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,800
To help you steal
inventions year after year.

924
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,960
And I still say those stolen pills
were the best invention yet.

925
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,800
Well, this time they really paid off.

926
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,640
Guess what Mommy found out
about our favorite little monster?

927
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,160
Or should I say actress?

928
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,200
Oh.

929
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,120
Eva.

930
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,360
Eva, Eva!

931
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:12,440
Just breathe. Okay.
Center yourself on the body.

932
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,680
I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. Director.

933
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,840
Oh, no, this isn't happening.
Act graceful. Act graceful.

934
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,960
Keep smiling.

935
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,000
Too close?

936
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,480
No. Eva, you look...
You look beautiful.

937
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,800
Oh this is such a clich,

938
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,160
the leading lady falling
for her director.

939
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,160
Well, you're not used to high heels

940
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,240
Oh, you mean...

941
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,480
Our work here is done.

942
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,720
Our work?

943
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,880
You spent the entire time
playing with a piece of ribbon.

944
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,920
Eva, about the audition, I think
I've given you the wrong direction.

945
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,600
But I feel so prepared.

946
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:17,800
No, I've been trying to make you
play a role that you're not right for.

947
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,800
What?

948
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,000
I have to tell you the truth.

949
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,520
He did.
I'll just be a minute.

950
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:32,040
Oh, Igor. Ow!
My ankle.

951
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,920
It twisted like the pretzel, Igor!

952
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,880
Enchanting.

953
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,480
Thank you. And who are you?

954
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,880
Someone who does not want
your unique gifts to go to waste.

955
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,480
Are you a talent agent?

956
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,920
I was so deep down worried

957
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,760
that when you opened the card
I thought I lost you forever.

958
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,800
Heidi, I need to tell you something.

959
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,320
I don't know what it is,

960
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,480
but I fee like for the
first time in my life,

961
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,640
I'm seeing a real Igor.

962
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,160
And I think I'm in love with him.

963
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,640
Wow, when it rains, it pours.

964
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,560
No, no.

965
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,120
Igor is a liar.
He does this...

966
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,200
Igor would never lie to me.
Igor cares about me.

967
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,320
Cares?
He doesn't care.

968
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,240
Because he built you to be a weapon.

969
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,720
No, no, no, you re wrong.

970
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,120
He'll never look at you
and see a woman.

971
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,040
All he will ever see is a monster.

972
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,960
I don't believe you.

973
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,880
Open your eyes.

974
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,520
Igor has someone else
in mind for your role.

975
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,040
Heidi, no!

976
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,840
There's nothing more for you here.

977
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,960
Come with me.
I will make you a star.

978
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,560
No.

979
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,200
Oh!

980
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,560
What's wrong?

981
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,240
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I've made someone else.

982
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,320
Huh?

983
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,880
I mean, I've met someone else,
who I made. It s complicated.

984
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,280
Wait a minute.

985
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,120
You're rejecting me?

986
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,200
I'm sorry.

987
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,880
For that big bumpy thing?

988
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:33,880
How do you know about...

989
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,400
I mean, this isn't even the sexiest me,
but come on! Look at you.

990
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,640
You're hideous.
You really are.

991
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,760
And I kissed you!

992
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,120
Ugh! Yuck!

993
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,280
Um...

994
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,520
You're a monster.

995
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:55,160
And as we know, monsters
only exist to be used.

996
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,640
Schadenfreude!

997
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,640
Eva.

998
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,800
Seize him!

999
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,720
Where's Glickenstein?

1000
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:14,360
And before you answer,
you should know

1001
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,680
that someone sent me this!

1002
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,680
Your Highness, he's dead.

1003
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,160
And he didn't invent life, did he?

1004
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,360
No.

1005
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:26,640
I did.

1006
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,840
An Igor inventing...

1007
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:30,920
Silence!

1008
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,480
Hunchy invented life, eh?

1009
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,200
Well, where is it?

1010
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,840
It's a she, and I think
someone's taken her.

1011
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:42,880
Well, if she comes back,
we'll just tell her where to find you.

1012
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,800
In the Igor recycling plant!

1013
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,080
No! Please!
No! No!

1014
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,560
Eva, where are you?

1015
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,440
Eva.

1016
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,440
Eva.

1017
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,880
<i>Lock your doors
and hide your loved ones.</i>

1018
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,480
<i>It's the annual Evil Science Fair!</i>

1019
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:39,080
I m Carl Cristall
and I m coming to you live, invisible

1020
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,120
and totally au nature!

1021
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,640
<i>Fans are taking their seats,
includlng King Malbert himself!</i>

1022
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,560
Don't touch me!

1023
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,680
<i>Meanwhile, the
scientists are in their locker rooms,</i>

1024
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,960
<i>prepping their Evil Inventions!</i>

1025
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,160
Here we are.
A dressing room fit for a leading lady.

1026
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,000
Wow, listen to that.

1027
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:18,040
How many girls are
auditioning for this project?

1028
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:31,280
I'm gonna go save him.

1029
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,320
Wait.

1030
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,280
Look, maybe I'm not a genius, okay.

1031
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,840
But I know one thing, I have to try

1032
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,920
No, I was gonna say,
"Wait I'm coming with you. "

1033
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,280
On three.

1034
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,080
One.

1035
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,760
Hey! No fair!

1036
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,000
What are you doing here?

1037
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,000
We're here to rescue you!

1038
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,400
I don't want to be rescued.
I'm an Igor.

1039
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,880
And this is what happens to us.

1040
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,480
Figures, just when I decided
I want to live...

1041
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,800
Don't peek.

1042
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,400
Don't worry.

1043
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,760
I hope I can still do a
decent audition without Igors help.

1044
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:28,320
Trust me, I'm the one who's gonna
bring out the real you.

1045
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,480
This isn't you, Igor.

1046
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,800
Where's all that stupid
optimism and annoying can-do attitude?

1047
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:37,000
I tried to be someone different,
but the world wouldn't let me.

1048
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:42,120
Don't you want to go after Eva
and save her from Schadenfreude?

1049
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,560
Are you actually trying to
hypnotize me, Brain?

1050
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,760
Yes!

1051
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,760
But if that's not working,
then how about this?

1052
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:50,840
<i>Ow!</i>

1053
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,640
Eva needs you and you're
the only hunchback

1054
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,280
that can stand tall and fight for her.

1055
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,760
Brain, that may be the smartest
thing you've ever said.

1056
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,520
Reach, Brain! Reach!

1057
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,680
You should have built me
with a longer arm.

1058
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,760
Huh?
Huh?

1059
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,520
What? Like this is the first time
I ve gnawed my own feet off.

1060
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,680
Who says rabbits' feet are lucky?

1061
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,000
Wheels, don't fail me now!

1062
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,840
Wheels failed me!
Wheels failed me!

1063
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,080
We went that way!

1064
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,960
What are you doing?

1065
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,320
Looking for the secret passage!

1066
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,840
There's always a secret passage!

1067
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,720
Darn it Brain,
there's no secret passage!

1068
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,120
It's over.

1069
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,200
I'm sorry, you were saying?

1070
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,760
Technically,
it's a secret staircase.

1071
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,920
<i>Welcome! To you and the millions
of viewers around the globe!</i>

1072
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,200
<i>They come from all corners.</i>

1073
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,560
<i>And just look at them.</i>

1074
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,240
<i>They're all worried sick
about one thing, world peace.</i>

1075
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,800
<i>Well, tonight, it's within their grasp.</i>

1076
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:27,360
<i>And it has but a small price,
and that prlce is $100 billion.</i>

1077
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,680
And I, for one,
I think they can do it.

1078
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,280
And if they don't we I,

1079
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,240
the Evil Invention last standing
will be unleashed on the world.

1080
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,280
Ah! It'd just be too
horrible to imagine.

1081
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,280
Where are we?

1082
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,560
And why am I panting?

1083
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:57,880
I don't have lungs.

1084
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,560
The tower of the King's castle.
Look, there's the Killiseum.

1085
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,880
Wow, I don't know what it is,
but I want one!

1086
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,760
It's the beacon of evil
on top of the royal castle.

1087
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,880
Wait. Is it a beacon?

1088
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,960
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

1089
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,080
And bring me back a toy!

1090
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,040
The King's beacon is
really a weather ray.

1091
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:21,760
King Ma bert is making the storm clouds.

1092
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,240
<i>So, citizens
of the world, I beseech you...</i>

1093
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,240
<i>- He lied to us.
- ... call the number</i>

1094
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,280
<i>on the bottom of your screens.</i>

1095
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,480
<i>Yes, right there.</i>

1096
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,680
<i>You need to give, just
like we need to be evil.</i>

1097
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,400
You need to be evil.

1098
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,080
I know my choreography,
if that's what you mean.

1099
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:43,440
I think you need to go deeper.
Have you ever done anything evil?

1100
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,320
No.

1101
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:46,640
Well, then how can you
play it truthfully?

1102
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,160
You know you can't get
this part if you fake it.

1103
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,320
Hit me.

1104
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,000
- What?
- Hit me.

1105
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,680
I could never hit anyone.

1106
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,560
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1107
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,520
Igor was right.
You are not an actress.

1108
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,560
Yes, I am.

1109
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,960
Oh, no, you're not.
No wonder he chose Heidi.

1110
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,880
I mean, you know,
she's beautiful and you are not.

1111
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,560
She has got talent and you do not.

1112
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:07,640
Don't you say that!

1113
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,200
Look at you.
You are pathetic!

1114
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,520
No, I'm not!

1115
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,600
Yes, you are!
You're just a big, freaky...

1116
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,600
And here it is baby.
Buckle up, here it comes.

1117
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:18,960
You are an ugly monster!
You couldn't act your way out of a...

1118
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,080
Ah!

1119
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,360
We've got Annie!

1120
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:46,120
Malarians, let's get evil.

1121
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,440
What? You're gonna lower yourself down?

1122
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,400
You've got your job, I ve got mine.

1123
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,720
I'm coming, Eva!

1124
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,320
And bring me back a toy!

1125
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:34,640
Phew!

1126
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:35,920
That was close.

1127
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,880
He s okay! He's...

1128
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:41,920
Oh!

1129
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,680
I'm coming, Eva.

1130
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,480
Pull the switch!

1131
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:58,560
<i>And here comes
this year's Evil Inventions!</i>

1132
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:31,160
<i>What a menagerie
of mayhem-loving monstrosities.</i>

1133
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:40,480
<i>Take a good look, world,
any of these could be coming for you!</i>

1134
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,960
<i>Only one Evil Invention left.</i>

1135
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:48,320
Time for my crowning achievement.

1136
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:49,840
Pull the switch!

1137
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,520
That's Dr. Schadenfreude's invention?

1138
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,600
Eva?

1139
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,480
Let the battle begin.

1140
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:22,760
No.

1141
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:30,920
<i>The sun'll come out</i>

1142
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:34,200
<i>Tomorrow</i>

1143
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,480
<i>Hold on!
What's this? It's fighting.</i>

1144
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:42,160
<i>Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow...</i>

1145
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,680
<i>And winning!</i>

1146
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:48,000
<i>There'll be sun!</i>

1147
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:50,280
Let me through!
Let me through! I made her!

1148
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,600
You made her?

1149
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:54,440
Hey, here's the genius
Igor that made her.

1150
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:57,960
<i>Just thinking about</i>

1151
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,800
<i>Tomorrow</i>

1152
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:05,120
<i>Clears away the cobwebs</i>

1153
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:08,040
<i>And the sorrow</i>

1154
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:12,880
<i>Till there's none</i>

1155
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:18,000
Eva, Eva!

1156
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,720
<i>And wait!
An Igor has entered the arena.</i>

1157
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:27,200
<i>I just stick out my chin and grin</i>

1158
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:29,720
<i>Don't worry,
folks, he'll be dead soon.</i>

1159
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,480
<i>Oh!</i>

1160
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,200
She's almost at her big finish!

1161
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:42,840
And if we don't destroy
this weather ray, it's really over.

1162
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:57,160
<i>The sun'll come out tomorrow</i>

1163
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:58,640
<i>So you gotta hang on</i>

1164
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,520
<i>Leave
it to Schadenfreude,</i>

1165
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:04,600
<i>destroying his enemies
with a giant girl in a red dress.</i>

1166
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:08,960
I can't believe
Schadenfreude did it again

1167
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,520
What are you doing in
the King's box, Schoddy?

1168
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,720
I was about to ask you
the same question, Malby.

1169
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,960
Malby? What's the meaning of this?

1170
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:21,640
This means you're through.
Or should I say 'overthrown"?

1171
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,920
Hey you unhand him.

1172
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:29,680
He's your new king.

1173
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,200
And if you have a problem with that

1174
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,440
please take it up with the head
of my complaint department,

1175
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,840
who's the big monster over there.

1176
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,600
Majesty.

1177
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,640
There's gotta be a faster way
to demolish this thing!

1178
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:46,440
We're all going to die! Except you!

1179
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:47,760
Oh, yeah.

1180
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:04,280
<i>Tomorrow</i>

1181
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:08,680
<i>Tomorrow</i>

1182
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,200
<i>I love ya</i>

1183
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:12,720
<i>Tomorrow</i>

1184
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,920
She's going to take
this whole place apart.

1185
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,880
<i>You're always a day...</i>

1186
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,960
Wait! This isn't you.

1187
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:30,000
I did create you to be evil.

1188
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:33,120
I'm sorry I lied to you.
I lied to you about everything.

1189
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,680
It's just a role.
You don't have to play it.

1190
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:43,240
Yes, she does! You're an Igor.
She's an Evil Invention!

1191
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:46,000
No. Everyone has
an Evil Bone in their body,

1192
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:48,360
but we choose whether or not to use it.

1193
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,200
And as someone I love once said,

1194
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:56,680
"It's better to be a good nobody
than an evil somebody. "

1195
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:29,160
I'm not evil.

1196
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,800
I'm Eva.

1197
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,040
That is the correct answer.

1198
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:39,800
Igor, I felt like
I was in a dark, horrible place.

1199
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:41,760
We all were.

1200
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,080
Wait! What's happening?

1201
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:47,160
The end of Malaria's
evil role in the world.

1202
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,600
Camera 2!

1203
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:52,240
<i>Oh! Excellent.
Thank you!</i>

1204
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:55,400
<i>For generations, Klng Malbert
has kept us in the dark</i>

1205
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:59,040
<i>by creating the clouds
with a weather ray!</i>

1206
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:00,480
<i>He lied to us!</i>

1207
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,880
<i>We trusted him and he lied to us.</i>

1208
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,680
<i>He tricked us into thinking
we needed to be evil to survive!</i>

1209
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,720
<i>But we don't!</i>

1210
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,000
None of us do.

1211
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,440
This is outrageous!
He has no proof!

1212
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:21,400
Where's his proof?
I demand to see proof!

1213
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,000
I demand to see...

1214
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,320
Oops!

1215
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,000
I'm sure he's fine.

1216
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:36,840
Long live King Schadenfreude!
Everybody!

1217
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,760
King Malbert the liar is dead!

1218
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,320
Long live King Schadenfreude!

1219
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,960
Everybody say, "Long live... "

1220
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,920
Well, that was a short reign.

1221
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:52,520
Hey, fellas, I'm single again!

1222
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,560
No more pills.

1223
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,680
They can't see what I really look like.

1224
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,320
My evil days are over!

1225
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:07,080
From here on out,
all evil doings will be handled

1226
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,960
by my manager/boyfriend.

1227
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:19,840
Eva! Eva! Eva!

1228
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:25,080
Eva Eva! Eva!

1229
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,080
President Igor,
now that you're in charge,

1230
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:39,200
will pants continue to be
as expensive and uncomfortable

1231
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,600
as they were under the
previous administration?

1232
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:44,360
What? What? No.
Everything is about pants.

1233
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:47,280
Why is everything about pants with you?

1234
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,840
There you have it.
Another politician afraid to answer.

1235
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,240
the tough, pants-related
questions of Carl Cristall.

1236
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:59,560
Pickles.
Old family recipe. Pickles.

1237
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:02,680
Cocoas Strudel!

1238
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,280
Mmm-hmm!

1239
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,480
Yuck!

1240
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,160
Pick me up at 7:00.
I'm gonna go home and shave.

1241
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,480
Hey Scamper,
have you seen Eva?

1242
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,240
No. Go away.

1243
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:23,920
Hans, you're wearing this backwards.
What are you? Blind?

1244
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:26,760
Let's switch this around.

1245
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:29,720
So, what do you do?

1246
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,880
I'm a genius. What do you do, mister?

1247
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,280
I'm sorry I'm late.

1248
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,760
I left your opening night gift
back at the lab.

1249
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,240
Oh, my necklace!

1250
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,800
Look inside.

1251
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,560
Oh, my gosh.

1252
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,400
You're really gonna make this?

1253
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:53,880
Yeah. And if it doesn't work out,
then we'll just adopt.

1254
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,560
It's a big step,
getting a pet together.

1255
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:02,080
Come on, after living
with Brain and Scamper

1256
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,600
everything will seem like a breeze.

1257
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:17,920
<i>I can see clearly
now the rain has gone</i>

1258
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:25,600
<i>I can see all obstacles in my way</i>

1259
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:33,240
<i>Gone are the dark clouds
that had me blind</i>

1260
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,800
<i>It's going to be a bright,
bright sunshiny day</i>

1261
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:47,440
<i>It's going to be a bright,
bright sunshiny day</i>

1262
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:54,240
<i>It's going to be a bright,
bright sunshiny day</i>

1263
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:56,880
<i># I got a pocket
# Got a pocket full of sunshine</i>

1264
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,960
<i># I got a love and I know
# that it's all mine</i>

1265
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:01,400
<i># Oh, oh, oh</i>

1266
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:05,160
<i># Do what you want

1267
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,320

1268
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,760
<i># Oh, oh, oh</i>

1269
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,840
<i># Take me away

1270
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,880

1271
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,040

<i># Wish that you could

1290
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,600
