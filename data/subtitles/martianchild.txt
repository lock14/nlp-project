Yeah, Oh... no.



I suppose there's one in every group.



One oddball who never fits in...



Well... that was me...



David Gordon.



I found my escape through my stories.



My imagination was a...



was like a rocket ship
that took me far away



where I could look at life from
a safe distance,



which I guess is what I
I now do in my books.



As unlucky as I was in childhood.
I was very, very...



lucky as a writer.



Um... so instead of becoming a



well adjusted,
normal person I became a kind of a...



deranged, successful person.



And I'm not sure...



which is preferable, but it doesn't really
matter 'cause you don't get to choose.



But to answer your original question



more directly yes,
I believe that in every work of fiction...



there is one character that for the author
is in some ways autobiographical. And...



that certainly holds true for Dracoban.



You know, like, in a dream,
one character usually represents you.



But in this case,
it's not who you'd expect.



Because, you see,
I'm not the human.



I'm the creature.



Is that good?



David...



Hey, Harlee.



Thought I might see you here today.



Yeah, I thought I might see you too.



Sweet of you to come.



I think we spent almost every single
birthday together since third grade.



Hi, Somewhere.



Somewhere's happy to see you.



So what do you think, honestly?



Are you Kiding? I love the idea of
you adopting a child.



I think it's so beautiful for you to
open up your heart like that.



Liz thinks I'm crazy.



What if she's right?
What if I'm not up to it?



Let me tell you something.
My mother raised five kids.



And never for one second did she question
whether she was cut out to be a parent.



And she was great, right?



No, the worst.



My shrink has a house in Laguna
because of her.



Mm.



Just the fact that you're even asking
yourself the question...



pretty much proves you're qualified.
Most peopl...



spend more time worrying about how to raise
tomatoes than they do their own kids.



Oan you even imagine
how happy Mary would be about this?



Yeah, but that's not good enough
reason to do it.



You've got a lot of love
left in your heart.



She always said you'd make
a terrific dad.



Yeah, but she also said I was gonna win
the Nobel Prize for literature.



Yes, and she also said that you snore,
that you can't balance your checkbook.



- Well, that's all true.
- But that you were great in bed.



David, hi.



Hi, Sophie.



- Been a long time.
- Yeah, it's been about two years.



- You look well.
- Thanks, you too.



I'm just not ready to commit to
something like this.



I'm sorry.



Didn't you know I was going to ask
you something like this?



Didn't wanna say no over the phone.



- Right.
- Didn't seem right.



I'm really sorry.



Hi.



What's your name?



- Esther.
- Hi, Esther.



I know who you are.



You do?



You're the man who Sophie
called you about Dennis.



But you don't want him
because your wife's dead.



Who told that?



Dennis.



Jesus.



Jesus is important, but other religions
are just as relevant.



Esther, do me a favor:



When you become president, please don't
take away my Social Security.



Are you a friend of his or what?



No.



He's a weirdo.
He doesn't have any friends.



He doesn't?



Well, where's he hangin' out?



He's in the box.



He doesn't come out until night.



Why does he do that?



The sun.



He hates the sun.



Why does he hate the sun?



I don't know.
Because he thinks it's too sunny?



Right.



I told him you were weird.



He is in the box.



But I don't understand,
why did she call you in the first place?



Well, she thought she'd found
a good match for me.



Aren't, like, single men like the
bottom of the totem pole?



Hey. I am not a single man.
I am a widower.



And that is the worst of all worlds.



I am in the ground,
below the totem pole.



Well, I think it was really insensitive
of her to call in the first place.



I mean, it's only been two years.



Hey!



- Guys, get off the dog.
- We're just playing.



That dog is like 200 years old in human...



Would you do that to Grandma?!



Guys. Get off!



They drive me nuts and they're mine.



I don't know
why Mary wanted to adopt.



She was adopted herself, and...



Yeah, but it was something you were
going to do together and... you know.



Hey, it's not gonna happen.
You're preaching to the converted.



Okay, good. Because here's
a voice from the trenches:



Parenting is really hard. All right?



It's hard, and you need
at least two people.



Well, we had Mom and Dad.



We had two people and
they hated being parents.



I'm just sayin' there're no guarantees,
there's plenty of single



All right. Well, I don't want to see you get hurt.
You could have a kid of rage.



- Kid of rage?
- Yeah, well...



there was a TV movie and
they were crazy.



Listen, I got to go take The Omen
One and Two to soccer practice, okay?



So just stay here. You made the right
choice, that was a good decision, okay?



Have some coffee or some food or
something. We have snacks.



Hey, I miss her too.



Somewhere, a dog, barked and
then he licked his privates.



What do you think, Somewhere?



You think we could do it alone?



Anybody home?



Uh, listen, chief,
I, uh... I brought you some sunblock.



Very strong stuff.



SPF forty-five, that's Sun
Protection Factor, and, uh,



helps you against the ultraviolet rays,
which are...



they call 'em the UV rays...
Anyway, it's...



hypoallergenic and waterproof...



I'll just leave it for You



- Hi Sophie, how ya doin'?
- Fine.



You good?



Good.



Didn't expect to see you back here.



Yeah, I wanted to bring the kid
some sunblock.



What was that?



It's his Polaroid.



He likes takin' pictures.
There's no film in it, he just...



likes takin' pictures.



Just as a point of interest,



what made you think I'd be a good match for
a boy who spends most of his time in a box?



He thinks he's from another planet.



- Out!
- Looks great, guys. Thank you.



So, buddy, what do you think?



- Where's the pathos?
- What?



I mean, where's the pathos?
The Earl of Dracoban is dying.



This is a guy who's fought
his way across the galaxy.



You see, Rastaban... Rastaban was
a blue dwarf that became a red giant.



It's the red dwarf phase of the giant.



What're you ta... Look, I don't know
what I'm talkin' about.



But this I do know.



I see a production that is honoring
the world of your book.



Really. Takin' it very seriously.
That's what I see.



Speakin' of your book...



Guess who I got a call from today.



Your publisher.



Our publisher.



- Tina.
- Tina.



She ask you how
The Revenge of Dracoban is coming?



No, she shouted it.



You know what the problem is?



When I wrote the novel...



there's this giant massacre at the end,
and everybody dies.



- I know.
- All the characters are dead.



- I know, I sold it.
- It's a problem.



That's great. Let's move on
to the massacre scene.



What am I gonna tell Tina?



Tell Tina...



that somewhere in the deepest,
darkest bowels of Oastle Septar



the Earl's necromancers...



are bringing him back to life
against his will.



If that's possible. Is that any good?



Sure.



It says "Fragile. Handle with care,"
for God's sake.



David... and hello, Earth to David...



a kid who sits in a box all day is
a giant red flag. All right?



It's like the equivalent...



of buying a used car and ignoring
the oil spill in the driveway.



You know, for a non-writer,
you're becoming the queen...



- of the muscular analogy.
- OK.



Listen. The thing about kids...
and I wouldn't trade mine for the world...



is that they keep comin' at ya.



All right? They're-They're like mosquitoes
suckin' the life outta you.



They take away your life,
your privacy, your identity.



You should work for Planned Parenthood.



You joke.



You forget that whole shelf full-a books you
wrote or your knowledge of Oalifornia wines or...



that you ever ran a marathon...



here's the thing, Liz.
I never ran a marathon.



I don't want to run a marathon.
I want to do something meaningful.



You know?



And I get all the arguments against it.



I even get the one says I don't know
if I wanna bring another kid into this world.



But how do you argue with the logic
of loving one that's already here?



Trans-fobo-meet-io.



Trans-fobo-meet-io.



Trans-fobo-meet-io...



Trans-fobo-meet-io.



Dennis.



Dennis.



- What're you doing? It's rai...
- I'm waiting for David.



What?



The man with UV protection.



Oome in.



Anybody in there?



Brought you somethin'.



Those really help cut out
the glare in your...



...ongoing battle with the sun.



Thank you.



You're welcome.



Quality throw, chief.



Nice to see you.



Very nice to see you, actually.



He's not a puppy in a window,
you know.



I know.



You see, he's been abandoned.



Emotionally abused,
he's classified as hard to place. He's...



never had a family of his own.



I know, but am I the right person for him?
I'm just a writer.



He's seen a lot of doctors,
if that's what you mean.



But that's not what he needs.



At least tell me what you're thinking.



I'm thinking I must be out of my mind.



You remembered your sunscreen.



It works just as good
if you don't put so much on.



Is that your weight belt?



Earth's gravity is weak.



Mars is constantly pulling me back.



So without all that stuff,
you think you'd just float away?



That ever happen before?



Yes.



When?



With another mommy and daddy.



"Uncommunicative...



a tendency to steal things, inability to



form personal attachments or
distinguish



between right and wrong.
And he thinks..."



He thinks he's from outer space.



Not to put too sharp a point on it,
but I think he thinks he's from Mars.



How do you plan to deal with that,
Mr. Gordon?



Fantasy is my business.
It's what I do for a living.



And one of the things
I've learned about fantasy,



I mean, in my own life is that
it can be a survival technique...



...you know?
Kind of a coping mechanism.



A way to deal with problems
that are bigger than you... bigger than you're...



you're capable of dealing with.



Uh, so uh, you know,
the-the-the- the short answer is um,



you know, try to find that balance
between socializing him



and letting him be who he is.



So, um...



you know, um...



so, you know, on the one hand, uh,



help him out as much as I can



and on the other hand,
uh, if he wants to...



if this little guy wants to believe
he's from another planet, you know...



I mean, who am I to argue?



This isn't science fiction,
this isn't a short story.



Very often with our children
we don't get to have a second draft.



Yeah.



A single man raising a child with



problems that are not common,
that are not easy...



You're gonna need all kinds of help.
You-you'd need to include us. Include me.



- Does anybody have anything?
- No.



We're gonna take some time to think
about this. Thank you, Mr. Gordon.



We'll let you know.



- Hello?
- Hey, man.



What's up?
How's things on the planet?



Go away.



What?



- Hello?
- Hey.



Liz, I can't talk right now,
I'm waiting for the call.



But you have call waiting.



But I don't trust it.



Your uncle is nuts.



Hello?



Really?



Yes!



Oh, my God.



Thanks for comin' out here
with me today.



It's pretty.



I thought you'd like it.



It's cool.



I like the holding-down belt.



You can wear the holding-down belt
all day long if you like.



Listen, Dennis,



Mr. Lefkowitz said you can come...



live in my house if you want.



It'd only be temporary at first,
but if you like it...



you could stay.



I eat Lucky Oharms.



I am a big believer in
a substantial breakfast.



Got your suitcase, sport.



I got it.



Okay.



Go ahead.



You can come through here.
Oh, right over here.



This way, young squire.



Hey! Somewhere!



Hey. S-Somewhere. Somewhere,
down, boy, down, boy.



Hey, sorry, that's just Somewhere.
It's just his way of sayin' hello.



We don't have those
where I come from.



Not a dog person, huh?



I was just waiting for the boys
to get home.



W-Well, what is he doing now?



He's just... He's just in his room.



Should I give him some space,
go in there?



I'll call you back, I'll call you back.



This is kind of an-a...



of an interesting thing.
It's a special night light...



that, as you can see...



it has pictures of the planets and
the solar systems and...



see, they kinda spin around.
It's got mirrors



and lights on the bottom and pictures.



That's not right.



Yeah? Well, what do you mean?



You'll have to make the ceiling bigger.



And you have to make
your planet like this.



You're-You're absolutely right...
For the For it to be accurate,



the-the ceiling would have to be,
I don't know, a hundred feet...



long and the Earth would be
the size of a pea.



Very, very good. How do you know
that much about scale?



It took a very long time to get here.



A very, very, very long time
to get here.



We can get rid of some
of those old clothes if you want.



Or we can keep it till it literally



disintegrates and falls off your body.



That's a good way to go too.



That's kinda cool.



I used to be good at video games.



It's not a game.



It's not?



Whatever it is, it's cool.



Should I close the door or
should I just leave it open, or?



Halfway?



Leave it open?



Midway?



Just think of it as a bigger box.



All right, Dennis.
I think you're gonna enjoy this.



But listen, before we eat,
rules of the house.



First rule: No girls after ten p.m.



Just kidding on that one.



Uh... the first rule is that there...



there really aren't any rules.
You know?



Just maybe some basic stuff about...



Got to put a sticker there,
I guess.



Listen, maybe we can,
uh, have a...



I don't know, more of a guideline more than
a rule that-that we don't um,



...wear the sunglasses indoors,
just for navigational purposes.



This is a grilled cheese sandwich. Uh,



I made you a grilled cheese sandwich
'cause I love grilled cheese sandwiches.



I think that they're...
you know,



an American classic.



I used to eat these a lot
when I was a kid.



I loved 'em.



I eat Lucky Oharms.



Yeah, sure, for breakfast
you can have Lucky Oharms...



or maybe some granola or yogurt,
any kinda cereal. That sounds great.



So, anyway...



...bon appetit.



Try that.



I eat Lucky Oharms.



Oh, here we go.



Look at that.



All right, let's get more because,
you know, you never know.



We gotta stock up.



Never know whether there's gonna be
the avian bird flu or bubonic plague,



or any other sort of pandemic is
gonna come along



and gonna wreck your day.



Wanna make sure
you have the right supplies.



And this stuff is...



This stuff's got a, uh, shelf life of about
thirty-three thousand years.



If anything happened, the, um,



Apocalypse, four horsemen show up...



this stuff is still magically delicious.



We're Lucky Oharms guys.



Mary?



Dennis, are you okay?
What're you doing?



Watching you.



Oh...



It's a little late for that.



Dennis?



Dennis, what're you doing?



Oome on,
let's-let's put the camera away.



Dennis, please. Let's put the
camera away. Oome on, now.



Beware!



I almost Disneygraded you.



You almost disintegrated me?
Why would you wanna do that?



Hey, it's the, um...



It's the middle of the night, chief.
What're you doin'...



with all these pictures?
What're you doin' up?



Learning.



Learning? Learning what?



How to be a human and part of a family.



I think you speak for a lot of us there.



That's very good.



It's very realistic.



Um, maybe we oughta...



pick this up in the morning over a bowl
of Lucky Oharms, what d'you say?



Don't you think we should go
to bed now?



Yeah, yeah, I saw that. Yeah,
it's a very good expression.



- Yeah?
- Yes, Mr. Gordon.



Hi, Mr. Lefkowitz from Ohildren's Services.



Wh-What? Who?



This is Mr. Lefkowitz from
Ohildren's Services.



Oh, hi. Hello, sir. How are you?



Well, good.
More to the point, how are you?



Oouldn't be better.
Oouldn't be better.



Good. How's Dennis? Is there anything
we should talk about?



Mr. Gordon?



Hello, Mr. Gordon.



Uh, yeah. I'm here.



Yeah, hi.
I was asking if... if...



Do you have any concerns about Dennis
that you'd like to talk about?



No, no. Everything's going great.
Oouldn't be better, sir.



I think it's time to get you out
of the house.



Listen, imagination is a rare commodity.



Dennis has the soul of an artist.



He could grow up to be, you know...



become a prodigy like...
You saw Amadeus.



He could be a little Mozart in
waiting for all you know.



Mom, he's being gross.



- Oome on.
- Guys, let it go, okay?



Remember? It all ends up
in the same place, right?



Oome on, guys.



I mean, I want to be sensitive,
but he's a mess.



Hey, that's sensitive?



- You should hear blunt.
- No, but really.



Listen, my point is that not
everybody is born to be...



a go-with-the-flow,
happy little Gap-kid.



Right now, it looks like
he's gonna grow up to be...



Tiny Tim with a ukulele, all right?



What, are you breeding geniuses now?



Mozart, by the way,
died in a hovel at 27, drunk and...



Unspecified fever at 35.



Stuff like that.



Sure, we all enjoyed his music,
but did he enjoy himself?



Give me a chance.



You know, David,



as far as I'm concerned they're all
from Mars. At least your kid admits it.



See, this is a smart man.



- That's the correct answer, man.
- Smart man.



- You married a smart man.
- I know.



I agree they're all from Mars.



Strike two!



Here we go.



Strike three!



That was a nice strike-out, huh?



It's called a strike-out.



It's pretty cool, huh?
You want a peanut?



You know what's really cool
about baseball?



You know what I love about baseball?



Baseball is the only sport...



where you can fail 70 percent
of the time and still be great.



It's about trying hard and
never, ever, ever givin' up.



Just think about it. If you get a hit three out
of every 10 times you're at bat,



you're really good.



If you do a little bit better than that...



just a little bit better than that
maybe 3.2, 3.3 times...



you're great,



and you could be a star.



And you're gonna make it
to the Big Show.



And if you do that on the Big Show
you're a superstar.



Superstars don't exist.



Only supernovas or white dwarfs.



I deserve you. I really do.



You're out.



This guy doesn't look like
much of a hitter.



But we believe, don't we?



Oome on, now!



Strike three!



It's not lookin' pretty.



We're down by seven runs.



We're not hittin' a lick.



Oome on, batter.
We need a hit.



Yeah!



There you go.



Got a single.
Get something started.



I did it.



You did what?



I made a Martian wish.



You made a...



You made a Martian wish?



Yeah. Martians can wish for stuff.



Like hits?



Whatever.



You know, sometimes I make earth wishes
but they don't always work out.



Well, listen,
since you're in the wishing mode...



see this guy comin' up to the plate?



Wish for a home run.



That ball is gone!



Want him to win?



Unbelievable.
What an awesome display of power.



You're a prognosticator,
you're a scholar...



and now you're a baseball fanatic,
and I like it.



Let's hear it for
those Ooal Miners.



Unbelievable game.



Unbelievable game.



This isn't looking pretty.



Do you know we spend
an average of two weeks...



in a lifetime waiting for traffic lights?



I remember when all these lights...



were timed, you know,
when they were synchronized?



And you could just find this little seam
in the universe and float through.



Wow. Did you see that?



Yup.



I just gave you three minutes
of your life back.



Well, thank you.
I'll use them wisely.



Do that again.



Nope.



Why? 'Oause you don't want to or
'cause you can't?



I only have so many Martian wishes.



That's fair.



But if you want,



I can give you one.



Who wouldn't want one?



There, I just gave you a Martian wish.



Don't waste it.



I absolutely won't. I promise.



I'll use it
for something really important.



That was really intense.



You're just a freaky little dude, man.



Hey, Somewhere.



- This is Harlee.
- Hi.



She's... She's our good friend,
me and Somewhere.



She helped design this
whole garden, so...



I've heard a lot about you.



You want to say hi?



- No?
- It's okay.



Don't worry. Don't worry.



Isn't he wild?



He's great,
like a little Andy Warhol.



He has the same social skills,
by the way.



You know what I think it is?



What?



He's an old soul.



What does that mean?



Seriously.



It just means he's figured it out.



You're one relentlessly
sunny individual.



Yeah, well,
I don't always wake up that way.



And that is
what we so admire about you.



This particular move here that
he's got goin'...



can't be sanitary or safe.



He likes to vacuum.



No, no, no, he thinks he is the vacuum.
There's a difference, see?



That's so Zen.



It is, kind of, isn't it?



Yeah.



See?



More sunshine.



Keep your hips towards me, though,
if you can.



Just move this foot a little towards me.
No, no, not that part of your hips.



Just square yourself up this way.
Right like that, right?



And then hand on the bat and, remember,
you're gonna step forward.



When you hit the ball,
you can yell, "Hot coffee!"



Say it.



- Hot coffee!
- Say, "Hot coffee!"



All right, forget it.



Seven out of ten times you can fail...



but you're still a star.
A little better than that...



you'll go to the Big Show for
a cup of coffee.



- I like this game.
- I know. It's good, right?



It's a great game.



So, eye on the ball and swing.



That was a little late.



Watch the ball hit the bat.



Watch. Just have your eyes
go right there.



What is with your pitching?



- Here we go.
- Oh!



That was a little too early.



- But it was so good.
- Yeah.



It was a good form.



Almost, Dennis, that was nice.



All right now,
with fierce determination.



Want to see you, you know,
just groove on it.



You know,
get a little attitude.



You know, a little swagger.
You touch the plate.



Oome on, you're a lefty.
You're weird,



you're eccentric, nobody understands you.
You don't even understand yourself.



You know what I'm sayin'?



Yeah.



Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about.
Yeah.



Now hands back,
give me the eagle eye.



I'm scared.



- That's what I'm talkin' about.
- Yeah.



Oh! Oh!



Hot coffee!



Hot coffee.



Oh! Hot coffee!



Yeah, you drove it it down the line.
That's a fair ball! Run!



- Run! Run, Dennis!
- Fair ball! Run!



Drop the bat and run. Run.



Run!



- Dennis, run.
- Go, run! Run!



- Run!
- Quick!



Oome on now.



Oh, thank you, sweetie.



What was that for?



Oause they're giving medals to
all the wrong guys.



Hello, my name is Jeff.



Hey, buddy.



I'm a friend of your... David's...



um, and I have this present for you.



You're his agent.



Yes, I am.



Wow, that's, pfft, very good.
I'm impressed.



Where is, um, David?
Is he inside?



Is he inside?



Is he writing?
Is he writing inside?



Okay, buddy, listen, I'm...



- Hey, Jeff!
- Hey, buddy, how are ya?



Good to see you.
You met... You met Dennis, huh?



Yeah, we've just been getting
to know each other.



If he gets hungry...



Lucky Oharms all night long, right?



Lucky Oharms.



Knuckles?



He's not... It takes a while.



Hi. We're gonna go.



See you, buddy.
Nice to see ya.



God, I'm so proud of you, man...



- Yeah.
- Re-entering your life fantastic.



It's not going very well.



Buddy, you know what?



There is a long and proud tradition
of asking for help in the form of a nanny.



- No!
- There's absolutely...



No, there's no shame in that.



I'm not talking about...
I'm not talking about Dennis. He's fine.



I'm talking about, you know
the book's not going particularly well.



What... What's, um...
What's going on with the book?



Does that mean like
sagging-in-the-middle not good or what?



- No.
- Like the ending? Ya havin' a hard time...



noodling the ending? Oan I help you?
Is there anything I can help...



No, no, it's just that
there's an essential idea...



I haven't come to grips with.



But you know the great thing
about Dennis?



He is a fountain of ideas.



He is challenging all my assumptions,
all of them...



every one of them,
and I am going with it.



I just got to learn to be
a little less rigid.



Or a little more rigid.



Yup, it's great.



I'm so excited...



that you're figuring out the rigidity...



but, buddy, I am livin'
The Revenge of Dracoban...



on a daily basis and the forces of darkness
are closin' in on me, man.



Tina's coming to town.



- Oh, God.
- Yeah, she's havin'



...a big black tie party for you...



- and she expects you to...
- Party?



Ritualistically hand over
to her the first draft...



ever written of The Revenge of Dracoban
Part Two, the sequel.



- When?
- About six weeks from now.



You know, so that's it.



- When?
- January 28th.



She's doing it January 28th.



- What is the significance of that date?
- I don't know.



She's doing a book signing or
something that night.



- The book signing at the Museum of...
- Jesus.



I got to get a sitter!



Buddy, are you losin' your mind?



No.



Because if you are I just need
a little bit of lead time.



- Don't you think I deserve that after all these years?
- Don't worry.



You sure you don't want me
to come in with you?



Yes.



Yes, come in?



No. Don't come in.



Don't come in.



You need the umbrella?



Yes.



And the weight be
It's an absolutely essential item?



Okay.



You're gonna have
a great first day.



Dennis. Dennis. Dennis.



Listen, just...



Just be yourself.



That's all you got to do, okay?



Dennis, Dennis, Dennis, Dennis.



That way.



Hey, retard.



You little punks.



Oh, Jesus!



Sir, is there a problem?



Uh, no, no, no...



not at...
I'm just here to watch.



Yeah, that's a problem.



No, this is a total misunderstanding.
This is not what it appears to be.



Do you...



I'm a new parent.
That... That...



He's my... He's my son...



and it's his first day
and I was really concerned.



I came to check on my daughter.



That's my baby
right there in the brown.



- Driving the, uh...
- Mm-hmm.



Which one's yours?



Over off on the side there
hanging upside down.



Weirdo.



Good luck to you, sir.



Yeah.



He says he's counteracting earth's
gravitational pull...



because it impedes
the blood flow to his brains.



That's what the yogis believe.



Yogis don't have to
go to second grade.



Hey, there's no harm in being
a little eccentric.



This I know.



So, he thinks he's from Mars...



and you write about Mars,
that's great.



A little Martian chose you to teach him
about being human.



Oome on. He came to earth to
document our existence.



Listen, when I was 11 years old,
I saw The Sound of Music...



and from that moment on,
I was convinced...



I was the lost von Trapp sister.



You?



I was always waiting for Julie Andrews
to turn up with her guitar...



and get me the hell out of West Oovina.



Yeah, but did you go to school
in lederhosen?



Yes, I did.



That's a good look for you.



- He's a sweet little boy...
- Yeah.



But, uh,



he's not like the others.



Really?



The, uh, social worker says
he has above average intelligence...



but, you know, I guess
it just takes time for him to adjust.



He steals from the other children.



- Steals?
- We find things in his cubby'.



Shoes, pencils, retainers.



Um, you know,
Dennis has a really curious mind...



and I think he just really needs...



- You know, he's on his own kick where he wants...
- You know, if it were only...



If it were only about the stealing but...



Dennis needs special attention...



that we're simply
not equipped to offer here.



What do you mean you're
not equipped to offer?



I'm sorry.



About what?



What are you saying? You're saying
you're throwing him out?



Well, that's really...



That's really cold.



- Mr. Gordon.
- Hi.



Dennis and I had a nice, long chat.



Good. How'd that go, pal?



I'm an intelligent being.



I completely agree.



Um, why don't you and I chat?



Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You want to wait here?



What do I do for Dennis?
I mean, to...



Do what you're doing.



You know, you got to give
this some time.



You know, doctor,
I'm really concerned.



I mean, he's not making
any friends...



and he's not relating to me
particularly well...



and he just got expelled from
school for stealing...



and he's a very isolated little guy.



And when he, uh, you know, when he's
vulnerable and scared like that,



I just...



I mean, when he tells me
he thinks he's gonna float away.



He probably thinks
he's gonna float away...



because he's very smart...



and he sees that he's living in a world where
things and people do disappear.



I could give him a prescription,
but, honestly,



I...



I think that seeing
how another intelligent being...



keeps his feet on the ground
would be far more therapeutic for Dennis.



Mr. Gordon, all parents feel like...



they're the blind leading the blind.



Sure.



Listen, pal,
I got to talk to you about something.



Um, after Ohristmas break,



we're gonna start a new school.



And I want to see how
you feel about it...



because that can be kinda scary,
startin' a new school and,



you know, your teacher thinks
it's a good idea and so do I.



And, um...



It's good to measure things, huh?



Anyway, how do you feel about it?



You okay to take a fresh start?



Take a fresh run at a new school?



Would you be up for that?



What are you looking at?



That's where they found me...



on the grass by the big,
round building.



It was raining.



You know what's weird is that
was so long ago...



I would think you couldn't remember it.



I couldn't, so how could you?



They'll come back someday to get me.



Like, like summer camp?



You don't believe me.



So Martians can read minds, too, huh?



Martians can do lots of things you can't.



Besides changing traffic lights,
what can you do?



We can taste color.



Okay.



You can taste color.



Prove it to me.



Off with the glasses,
close your eyes.



They said this would happen.



Open up.



Open... Don't-You were lookin'.



You were totally lookin'.



Right, open up. Here we go.



What color is it?



- Red.
- All right, but that one doesn't count...



because we had obvious
ethical complications.



Open up.



Green.



Very good.



Open up.



Yellow.



Yes, it was.



This one?



Well?



I can't taste it.



It's blue.



I know. I can't taste blue.



A little too bright?



Shade it back up.



Oome, Flomar.



Did you just call Somewhere "Flomar"?



It's Martian for "warm, furry friend."



He picked it.



Oh.



- You want to get a glass of water for you?
- No. No, thank you.



Where do you...
Where do you want him to sit?



Hey, it doesn't matter.
Anywhere you want.



- Be laissez-faire about it, right?
- Okay.



Does he have turkey or
should I get some Lucky Oharms?



I don't know.
Ask boy wonder over there.



Okay.



Hey. Hey, Dennis.



Do you want to have some turkey with us?



I can't eat anything grown on
Saturn's moons.



Well, then, I think you're safe here.



That'll be great.



Okay, buddy?



You ever notice how far apart
his eyes are actually set?



No.



Or that his ears are
just a little bit pointy?



Little bit.



David?



All this time I was thinking that
I was no good as a father, right?



And that, you know,
I was working the Mars as a metaphor angle.



But then I was thinking to myself
what if that's not it?



What if he actually really is imbued,
you know with some special...



You know, he could be a little medium.



- David, you're hysterical.
- I know.



See, everybody says,
"Don't be hysterical."



But I say, "Why not be hysterical?"



Hysterical is the new calm.



My wife dies, boom...



I go out and I adopt
a kid from Neptune.



Should I just chill, or should I be
hysterical? You tell me.



I think hysteria is a way of life.



It's a clothing line at least.



I could stop writing not that
I'm writing anyway.



David,



I'm... I'm worrying about you.



Why?



Because I think what's really going on here
is you guys are really struggling.



You think I don't know that?



I know that.



You know,
you're still in a trial period. I mean...



You can return him like a
defective toaster, right?



Is that what you mean?



I... I guess what I'm trying to
say is that I...



I know you see a lot of yourself in him but,
David, I was there.



You were weird, and you had problems
but this kid is in a whole other league.



You know, what is so amazing about
you is that you're right.



You're always right and
you remember when you're right...



and you never let anybody else forget it.



I'm gonna just go out for a minute.



Hey, come on, Dennis.



Let's get out of here.



Gee, this was fun, huh?
A little later...



- I can make you some Lucky Oharms or something.
- David? David.



David, don't.



- That's okay. Well, you know, whatever.
- Oome on, it's Ohristmas.



- Of course, it is.
- You know? Where... Where you going?



Oome on.



I'm sorry. I didn't mean...



Well, "trial period," is that a code?



Okay.



You Know? I know.



I, You know what? I, I...



It's okay. Everything's cool.



- I was just trying...
- You know, I'm just tired.



But it's Ohristmas, David.



- No. We'll come over tomorrow.
- Just relax.



We'll come over tomorrow, okay?



Jesus! Dennis.



Was I bad?



No, you weren't bad and
you got to stop saying that, all right?



I don't want you to cut your feet.



And Daddy's...



I'm in here working.



We got to put this camera away for
a little while, okay?



But I haven't finished my mission.



Well, you have for today.



But I haven't finished my mission!



Give me my camera back!



I need it!



You got to calm down.



I have to go to work,
or you can go to your room.



You're gonna send me
away, aren't you?



Dennis, why would I send you away?



Because you're mad at me
because I broke your stuff.



Dennis, I don't care about
any of that stuff.



This is stuff.



There's nothing you can do
that would ever change the way I feel.



Do you understand?



Not gonna ever send you away.



Look, this is just stuff.



Oome on, break it like you mean it.



One more. Let it go, buddy.



Here's two. Oh, just one.



Nice one!
Over the head over the head, big time.



Like the Greeks.



That feels so good.



No, not that plate!



I got an idea, but we'll still have fun.



We'll still have fun.



I'm sorry. I'm just trying to have...



I'm just trying to have...
I'm so sorry.



I was just trying to have fun, buddy.



I will wail on you!



This is war!



This is war!



Just stay here.



Hey, Mr. Lefkowitz, uh, come on in.



Uh, what a surprise. Happy holidays.



Thank you. You, too.



Uh, we were just, uh, having, uh...



just having some fun. Sort of a,
uh... It's a breakthrough, you could say.



Nice to see you.
Very, uh,



vigilant of you to come
during the holidays.



I heard there was
a little trouble at school.



Just a little trouble.



Nothing we can't handle.



Right?



Would you mind very much
if Dennis and I went up to his room?



Maybe he could show me his room.
We could chat for a bit.



No, I wouldn't mind.
Would you mind?



Would that be okay, Dennis?



- I think it's okay with Dennis.
- Good.



Where's your room, Dennis?



It's downstairs.



He'll show you.



Thank you.



- Following you.
- Jesus.



Everything all right?



Hey, you knew about this stuff?



Uh, we're just gonna turn
that off real quick.



Yeah, yeah, sure,
we're, we're, um...



Have you seen this?



Yeah, yeah,
I know all about this.



This is a science project that
we're working on.



Kind of a whole transformation
and decay kind of a thing.



We take all the stuff from the house
and we put it in the baggies.



We take photos of it, and we put it away
then we come back to it.



Uh, Dennis and I...
Uh, Dennis mostly...



He'd study how it's...



- See, we're doin' it right now.
- Oar keys.



Sure. You know, car keys.



- Yours?
- Yeah, they are.



Passport, yours?



I knew about that, too. It's amazing
how much a passport can decay.



Everything's good. Everything's fine here.
Everything's great.



We just try to do the things and see...



how they have transformed and
decayed or not. Sometimes they don't.



- Lf... we could just talk in private.
- Yeah.



Good. Excuse us one second, Dennis.



- Outside.
- Please.



I'm just a little bit concerned here,
Mr. Gordon.



You seem to suffer from a syndrome
many adopting parents experience.



Shock?



You're so eager to become the child's friend
you forget to be a parent.



And Dennis needs a parent right now.



He needs a strong role model. He needs
someone to bring him down to earth.



He's been stealing again.



He's been expelled from school.



I think "expelled" is a harsh word.



I think there was a consensus reached
that it wasn't the right place for him.



Yeah, a consensus includes me.



The principal gave me no option.
I... I should have called,



and I apologize for that.



I'm gonna move
your case up for a review.



You'll be notified by mail.



I'll let myself out.



Mr. Lefkowitz, I do know...



that there's no one on this planet
that loves Dennis any more than I do.



I know that.



These pictures are mine.



And they're really important to me.



And I need to understand
why you took 'em.



Will you tell me?



Please, I need you to tell me.



Because you love her so much.



Ahem, that's really true...



but that doesn't change the way
I feel about you, pal.



Not even a little.



You know, Mr. Lefkowitz isn't sure...



that it's such a good idea that
you stay here...



so we gotta make him happy.



So when you're here at home,
it's okay to be from Mars.



But when you're out there
with the rest of the earthlings...



you know,
you gotta go by earth rules.



But...



what we will never do is
we will never, ever, ever...



ever, ever, ever give up.



Winston Ohurchill said that,
I think.



There's one other thing.



It's really serious.



Will you please teach me
how to do that disidney-grate thing?



How you do it?



You'll get it.



We have to do this.



I can't. You do it.



I think it should be
this shirt with these.



Okay.



It looks hot on you.



He'll look devastating.



He will. He will. That's fine.
That's fine.



Right?



What age do they start
making fun of you...



if you wear the wrong clothes?



- You know, like, uh, What... Fifth grade?
- Fifth grade?



That's when I started wearing my
rainbow-colored leg warmers every day.



Pretty much solidified my role as the weird girl
who sat in the back of class...



drawing Smurfs until ninth grade.



What happened in ninth grade?



I grew breasts.



That woulda done it for me.



My God, childhood is barbaric.



I know, it's tough.



But...



But what?



Maybe it's not supposed to be easy.



I mean, maybe the ones who have it easy
they're missing part of the adventure.



Don't you think
all the truly fascinating people...



in the world probably had
dysfunctional childhoods?



You sold me. I'm gonna send him to school
in the rainbow-colored leg warmers.



- Please don't.
- I will.



I'm not that fascinating.



Uh, thing about it is
I just worry about him all the time.



It's the curse of being a parent.



I think Dennis is happier than
he's been in a long time.



Yeah.



I think you are, too.



I should go.
It's late, and I'm tired.



Do you want me to make some coffee
for the ride home or something or...



or you could just stay here.



In the guest bedroom.



You don't have a guest bedroom.



That's right.
Best you were on the couch.



I didn't... Believe me, that That's not
what I meant. That was the furthest...



furthest thing from my mind.
Really.



Oh, really? The furthest?



Well, not the furthest thing from
my mind. It's just...



...things that are a little further away
like smallpox or, you know.



It's really...



I gotta go.



I gotta go feed the goldfish.



The goldfish?



I'm taking care of
my neighbor's goldfish.



Your neighbor's.



- Yes.
- I see.



They need to get fed.



Goldfish, huh?



- Good night.
- Yeah.



- You okay?
- Uh, yeah. Are you okay?



I don't know.



You are. You look okay.



- So do you.
- Okay. Bye.



You look great.



- What?
- You look good.



Oh, you, too.



You look great.



Great.



It's a cloudy day.



I know. That's why you don't need
all that sun block.



I do have a little bit
of bad news, though.



We're gonna have to do without
the holding-down belt.



But I'll float away.



I don't know much,
but I know this.



You will not float away.



- Promise?
- Guarantee it.



But you know... Oome on.



You know,
what I was gonna tell you is...



I don't know if I ever told you this
but when I was a kid, I used to pretend



like I was from another planet.



Why did you do that?



Well, I was going to a new school
and I was nervous...



and I wanted people to like me...



and, you know,
I was afraid I wouldn't fit in and...



Did you wear a hat?



Yeah.



Yeah, sometimes I did 'cause it was
Ohicago, and it was cold...



so sometimes I wore a hat.



You shouldn't have worn a hat.



There it is.



Well, anyway, after a while...



I learned to be a little bit
more like everybody else...



and to fit in a little bit.
And you know what?



It wasn't so bad.
It really wasn't so bad.



Is it good to be like everyone else?



That's a really good question.



Which is usually what adults say
when they don't have the answer.



I think what's important right now
to remember...



is that you need to learn stuff.



About human beingness.



Exactly right.



Instead of, you know...



Human Martianness.



Which you already know
a lot about, right?



Hi, Miss Margie.



- Mr. Gordon, hi.
- Nice to see you.



Do you remember Dennis?



- Hello, Dennis.
- Miss Margie.



Don't worry.
We're all very nice here.



Hey, listen, pal.



If you feel like you're nervous or
you can't handle it...



I'm gonna be right out there
and you can come get me in the car.



What if I don't feel good after
you leave?



Well, you can come get me.
I'll be there all day.



- All day?
- Mm-hmm. All day.



Okay. Your daddy has to go now, Dennis.



Okay, here you go, pal.



We're a little nervous 'cause we
don't have our weight belt today.



We're havin' gravity issues.
Okay, pal.



"And the radios crackled up and down the line
as the fighter lords received the command...



"and turned to their soldiers instructing...



"Fall where you stand.



"Fall where you stand."



And that is enough of Dracoban
for one night.



Good night, sweet prince.



Nice talk.



David!



- David!
- Yeah!



I'm coming!



Dennis, you okay, pal? What's wrong?
What's wrong? What's wrong?



Flomar.



Somewhere?



What's wrong with him?



Oh, Somewhere.



What happened?



Is he okay?



No, no.



He died.



Died?



Damn it.



Hey, let's go for a ride. Let's go for a ride.
Let's get out of here.



We'll go look at the stars.



Oome on, pal.



When I was a little boy like you
I used to think when you lost somebody...



they would go up there in the stars
and you can't see 'em anymore...



but you can talk to 'em,
and they can hear you.



Is that why you were crying...



because you won't see
Flomar anymore?



When you love somebody it's really hard
when you can't see 'em anymore.



Do you talk to Mary?



In a way I do, yeah, all the time.



That's probably why I come out here.



I can see Mars.



Get out. Where? I can't see it.



Oh, that's a good eye.



What do you think of when you see Mars?



That my mission is almost over.



I'll be going back soon...



and then everything will
go back to normal.



Dennis, can I just say
one last thing about Mars...



which may be strange
coming from a science fiction writer...



but, right now, you and me, here...



put together entirely from atoms...



that have been part of millions of other
organisms before they became us...



sitting on this round rock with
a core of liquid iron...



held down by this force,
that so troubles you, called gravity...



all the while spinning around the sun
at 67,000 miles an hour...



and whizzing through the Milky Way
at 600,000 miles an hour...



in a universe that very well may be chasing
its own tail at the speed of light.



And amidst all this frantic activity...



fully cognizant of our own imminent demise
which is a very pretty way of saying...



we all know we're gonna die...



we reach out to one another.



Sometimes for the sake of vanity...



sometimes for reasons you're not
old enough to understand yet...



but a lot of the time
we just reach out



and expect nothing in return.



Isn't that strange?



Isn't that weird?



Isn't that weird enough?



What the heck do you need to be
from Mars for?



So, look,
we're just gonna talk to 'em...



and we're gonna tell 'em about all of the
human stuff we like to do, and,



you know it'll be over before
you know it...



and everything will be fine.



Okay, deal?



Oause if I'm myself
they won't let me to stay with you.



No. No, no.



Whatever you say,
it's gonna be okay.



I love you very, very much.



Ah, you got your ankle weights there.



Be yourself.



- Oome on.
- Hey.



- Hi, Sophe.
- Hi.



You gonna come with me? Huh?



It's gonna be okay.



Let me go get some coffee here.
It's all all right.



So, Dennis,
how you getting along at school?



Okay.



Is there something you want to
tell us about?



No.



You don't seem very happy today, Dennis.



I'm stellar.



So, um, all this moving from school to school
how's that been for you?



Mm, there's been some rough times...



but the important thing is to, um,
you have to face your problems...



and you should never ever, ever, ever...



ever, ever give up.



Never ever, ever, ever.



Winston Ohurchill said that...



I think.



Winston Ohurchill,
he was a very smart man, huh?



Hey, Dennis,
when we've spoken before...



you... you said that you were from
another planet.



Mars.



Mars, right.



Zepper nicki whawok.



Trans fobo medio.



Sometimes it's okay to pretend...



and sometimes it isn't.



So you... You were just pretending?



And then I started doing science...



and I realized we were
spinning around the sun...



at 67,000 miles an hour...



held in place by gravity.



So what the heck do
I need to be from Mars for?



I think it was because I didn't fit in.



And then I started to learn
how to be like everyone else.



Dennis, did, um...



Did Mr. Gordon coach you on...
on what to say here today?



He only coached me on one thing.



What's that?



If you hit three out of ten,
you're a star.



If you get even a little better than that...



a little better than that,
you're a superstar.



You get a cup of coffee.



Hot coffee.



Well, how'd it... How'd it go?



I told them about baseball.



You did?



Then I told them about hot coffee.



You didn't? Did you really?



- Mr. Gordon.
- Yeah?



Oongratulations.



Thank you.



Sophie.



We are highlighting the search for extra
solar planets here at the observatory.



And, well, as many of you know,
the Draco system...



is, uh, the prime focus of the search.



And, well, who better to talk about it
than David Gordon,



whose sci-fi best-seller Dracoban...



has brought this exciting search into
the public eye.



David.



Thank you.



Let's see.



Uh, thank you.



I was fascinated with seeing Draconis...



because it was a system...



that could closely mirror
our solar system...



No planet has been the subject of more
romantic speculation than Mars.



At one point,
it was commonly believed...



that Mars was inhabited by
an ancient civilization...



that had dug an intricate system
of irrigation channels...



and the annual darkening of the planet...



was interpreted as the growing
season of plant life.



But the flyby missions of Mariner I,
VII, and VIII...



showed that the irrigation system...



was nothing but an enormous
network of canyons...



and the famous darkening due to
annual dust storms.



Soil samples taken by the Vliking landers...



showed a complete absence of organic material
from the planet's surface.



In other words,
there is no life on Mars.



No planet has been the subject of more
romantic speculation than Mars.



At one point,
it was commonly believed...



This is not how I remember it.



This isn't it.



I think I'm from a different Mars.



Are you angry with me?



No, I'm not angry with you, I just thought
we agreed that you weren't...



gonna be from Mars.



Jesus, I can't even say that
word anymore.



I thought I was pretending so
we could stay together.



No. Oome on, pal.



You don't believe I am from Mars...



- do you?
- Oh, come on, Dennis...



I think that sometimes
you think you are, okay?



- Stop!
- No, no. You stop, Dennis.



- I mean, it's...
- The car!



I'm so sorry, officer. I was having
a conversation with my son...



and I didn't...
I turned the corner.



I'm really sorry.



Driver's license, please.



I usually have it right here.



Dennis, did you take
my driver's license?



Freen-awa-blee-meet-ia.



Dennis, I'm asking you a question.
I need you to answer me.



Did you take my driver's license?



This is serious, okay?



Freen-awa-blee-meet-ia.



Dennis! Answer the question!



Freen-awa-blee-meet-ia.



Dennis, you took my license!



No, I didn't!



Dennis!



I didn't steal it!



What did you do with her pictures?



I didn't steal 'em. I need them.



Oh, come on, man!



That's not fair!
We talked about all this!



Stop. Those are mine.



It's not your stuff,
Dennis! It's my stuff!



Stop.



Dennis,



adults get their feelings hurt
just like little boys.



This is my stuff.



Stop.



No!



Stop!



Go ahead. Go ahead.



Why don't you?



Trans fobo medio. Trans fobo medio.
Trans fobo medio. Trans fobo medio...



Trans fobo medio. Trans fobo medio.
Trans fobo medio. Trans fobo medio...



- Dennis, Dennis.
- Trans fobo medio.



- Dennis, Dennis, stop.
- Trans fobo medio.



You're not a Martian.
You're just a little boy.



And maybe I can't help you.
Maybe I'm not cut out for this.



Stay here and just...
Just cool out for a minute.



Look, it's just gonna be like, you know
I'm gonna show my face for twenty minutes...



- Hey, no. Take your time.
- Then get back on the road.



Take your time.
Do what you gotta do, you know?



Don't worry about us.



- Okay.
- Great.



Thanks for watching him.



Oh. It's...



You're my brother.



He's my nephew.



Dennis?



Hey, wow. That is cool.



Listen, I'm gonna finish cleaning up
the kitchen...



and call Nicholas and
Jonas and check in on them...



and I thought then I can come back
and hang out, okay?



All right, big guy?



I'll be back.



Oongratulations.



Who is this handsome fellow?



I look like Ohairman Mao.



That's right. You brought
your Little Red Book.



- Oh, that's hideous.
- Louie. Louis?



Louie, right here, snappy snap.



Welcome to the big time, Mr. Gordon.



Tina.



- I was wondering about you.
- So lovely to see you.



You wouldn't be the first.



Everybody, this is David Gordon
and he is brilliant.



And I see he's brought me
a little present.



This is the first draft of
his new book.



And let me tell you,
it did not come cheap.



- Ah, David.
- Yeah?



I'd like to introduce you to Leonard.



He's the head of our marketing.



Nice to meet you.



He's absolutely brilliant.



- Yeah?
- Welcome to the club.



Tina likes to surround herself with
brilliant people.



I can see that.



Well, shall we just give this manuscript
to my assistant for safekeeping?



Linus.



Tina, actually, could I speak with you
in private for a moment?



There's just... I have something
I need to talk to you about.



Uh, listen, this might be a little awkward.



That's my least favorite word.



I'm sure.



Uh, well, could you
take a look at this?



I just want to talk to you
'cause it's a little...



different situation here than
I imagined.



Martian Ohild?



- What's this?
- Is that the alternate, uh...



alternate title idea, buddy?



I thought we agreed on
The Revenge of Dracoban.



Yes. Yes, we did. Um...



but I must say it's more than
just a title change.



So this is the, um,
quantum alternate universe?



- Shut up.
- An idea that...



I tried to write Dracoban.
I really, really, really did.



Well, what's the problem?



I adopted a boy.



Adopted this very fantastic,



difficult young man and
he is very much alive...



and those characters were dead,
and I had to do this.



No, we have a contract.



We paid you a substantial amount.



I know, I know, I know, I know.



And I'II, um, ahem...



I'll write the other one,
or I'll just pay you back.



It's unacceptable.



I'll refinance my house
if that's what it takes. I don't care.



I don't want the money.



I want a Harry bloody Potter in space.



That's what I paid for.



Leonard created an extremely expensive
marketing campaign around this book...



and Dracoban is the cornerstone
of that campaign.



I can't do anything without that.



Do you comprehend
what I am telling you?



You get that, don't you, buddy?
Do you understand that?



Why can't you just be
what we want you to be?



I got it.



Beware. Beware. Beware.



What time is it? I'm so sorry.



I'm gonna write the other thing.
I'm gonna make this up to you, I promise.



You're gonna get a whole series,
rivers of blood...



but just read that because it's good.



It's really good.



And I have to go,
but this was great and I'm sorry.



Hey, Dennis!



What do you say, um...



to some hot chocolate or...
or somethin'?



Does that sound kinda good?



Or... Tang?



Do you know what Tang is?



It's... It's something that
the astronauts drink.



Might like that.



Liz!



Liz!



Liz!



- We just... We just
- What happened?



Can't find him.



- You can't find him?
- He was fine.



Everything was fine. He was in
his room, and I went to get him...



- some hot chocolate.
- It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.



- It's okay.
- Then we just called the police...



- Where... Where's...
- just to make sure.



Where's the last place you saw him?



He's nowhere in the house.



Are you sure?
You checked everywhere?



It's so beautiful.



Maybe he is a little Mozart.



What does it mean?



Means goodbye.



Hey, Harlee, just stay there.
Stay in the car, okay?



Did you find him?



No, no, but I know where to go.
Oan you drive me?



- Yes.
- All right.



I can get the police to move their car.



No. Don't worry about it.



- Okay.
- Okay.



All right. Oall me.



Put your seat belts on!



- You go that way, and I'II...
- David.



- Oh, My god
- Talk to him. Go, go, go, go.



Dennis, stay where you are!



David's coming to get you...



so just don't move, okay?



Don't... Really,
just don't walk, sweetie.



You gotta just try to stay still.



Dennis.



Dennis?



Dennis. Dennis, stop movin'.
Here I come.



Dennis, I'm comin' to get you.



Just... Just... Just stay still.
Please, please.



Dennis, stop movin'.



They're here.



Dennis, hold on, pal!
I'm comin'!



Why are you here?



You can't come with me.



Okay.



Give me your hand.
I'm gonna take you home.



No. I have to go back now.



My mission is over.



Dennis, stop.



Please stop moving.



They're here.
They came back for me.



It's a helicopter, Dennis.
We've all been lookin' for you.



It's not a helicopter. It's not.



Okay. Dennis, give me your hand.
I'm gonna take you home.



I am going home.



I don't belong here.



Okay.



Put the suitcase down...



and hold onto
the edges really tight...



and I'll wait with you until
they come, okay?



I'm sorry, David.



What are you sorry about?



I'm sorry that I have to leave...



but...



I'll tell them about baseball...



and Lucky Oharms...



and Flomar.



Yeah. You can tell 'em about
all the stuff we did...



and how much fun we had.



Dennis, look at me.



Tell 'em about all the fun stuff
we did...



and, you know,
how much fun we had.



You can tell 'em
how hard you tried...



you know, to fit in,
to be like all of us.



Human beings can be kinda cruel...



I promise I'll tell 'em
you were nice to me.



Thanks.



You're a great human, Dennis.



That's the funny part and I just wanted
you to feel like you belong to me...



cause that's what I think
you really want underneath all this.



I think you want to belong to someone.



I wish we could have more time together.



I want to prove to you
that not all parents disappear forever.



Why do they go sometimes?



I don't know. That's a...



I don't know.



That's a mystery.
Sometimes it's their fault,



and sometimes it's not.
It's a... It's a mystery. I don't know.



Why? Why?



Why do you think they left me?



Because...



Because they were stupid!



Whoever let you go those were
the stupidest beings in the universe.



I mean, they were so dumb they couldn't even
see what was right in front of 'em.



How could they not see
how extraordinary you are...



how big your heart is?



I'm not even that smart,
and I can see it.



It's so obvious.



I mean, you're the easiest kid
in the world to love.



Well, to me, you are.



You know what I think?



I think you love me, too.



Like you're just filled with it.



Think it's just waiting to
burst out of you.



Dennis, you're my son.



You're my home, forever.



And I will never, ever, ever...



ever, ever...



ever, ever, ever...



leave you.



Okay. I got you.



I got you.



I got you.



Hey, Dennis,
I got my Martian wish.



- Oh, my God.
- It's okay.



Sometimes we forget that children
have just arrived on the earth.



They are a little like aliens
coming into being...



as bundles of energy and
pure potential...



here on some kind of exploratory mission...



and they're just trying to learn
what it means to be human."



For some reason, Dennis and I reached out
into the universe and found each other



we'll never really know
how or why...



and discovered that
I can love an alien...



and he can love a creature...



and that's weird enough for both of us.



Two, three. Hold on!



Oome on, one more,
one more, one more.



One, two, three.



Was that good?
