1
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:58,824
Yeah, Oh... no.

2
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,859
I suppose there's one in every group.

3
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:03,919
One oddball who never fits in...

4
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,362
Well... that was me...

5
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,358
David Gordon.

6
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,065
I found my escape through my stories.

7
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:13,901
My imagination was a...

8
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,736
was like a rocket ship
that took me far away

9
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,742
where I could look at life from
a safe distance,

10
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:21,075
which I guess is what I
I now do in my books.

11
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:25,140
As unlucky as I was in childhood.
I was very, very...

12
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:27,810
lucky as a writer.

13
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,050
Um... so instead of becoming a

14
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,160
well adjusted,
normal person I became a kind of a...

15
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,720
deranged, successful person.

16
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:37,964
And I'm not sure...

17
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:40,533
which is preferable, but it doesn't really
matter 'cause you don't get to choose.

18
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:41,966
But to answer your original question

19
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,904
more directly yes,
I believe that in every work of fiction...

20
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:49,409
there is one character that for the author
is in some ways autobiographical. And...

21
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,209
that certainly holds true for Dracoban.

22
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:58,548
You know, like, in a dream,
one character usually represents you.

23
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,550
But in this case,
it's not who you'd expect.

24
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:05,124
Because, you see,
I'm not the human.

25
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,453
I'm the creature.

26
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:14,593
Is that good?

27
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:29,940
David...

28
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,313
Hey, Harlee.

29
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,423
Thought I might see you here today.

30
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:40,221
Yeah, I thought I might see you too.

31
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,131
Sweet of you to come.

32
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:56,641
I think we spent almost every single
birthday together since third grade.

33
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,170
Hi, Somewhere.

34
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,974
Somewhere's happy to see you.

35
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,553
So what do you think, honestly?

36
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,455
Are you Kiding? I love the idea of
you adopting a child.

37
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:12,288
I think it's so beautiful for you to
open up your heart like that.

38
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,160
Liz thinks I'm crazy.

39
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,263
What if she's right?
What if I'm not up to it?

40
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,465
Let me tell you something.
My mother raised five kids.

41
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:23,036
And never for one second did she question
whether she was cut out to be a parent.

42
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,504
And she was great, right?

43
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,905
No, the worst.

44
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,007
My shrink has a house in Laguna
because of her.

45
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:29,099
Mm.

46
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:32,175
Just the fact that you're even asking
yourself the question...

47
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,540
pretty much proves you're qualified.
Most peopl...

48
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:38,749
spend more time worrying about how to raise
tomatoes than they do their own kids.

49
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,019
Oan you even imagine
how happy Mary would be about this?

50
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,319
Yeah, but that's not good enough
reason to do it.

51
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,253
You've got a lot of love
left in your heart.

52
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,635
She always said you'd make
a terrific dad.

53
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:59,071
Yeah, but she also said I was gonna win
the Nobel Prize for literature.

54
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:02,942
Yes, and she also said that you snore,
that you can't balance your checkbook.

55
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,706
- Well, that's all true.
- But that you were great in bed.

56
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,824
David, hi.

57
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,134
Hi, Sophie.

58
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:35,606
- Been a long time.
- Yeah, it's been about two years.

59
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,870
- You look well.
- Thanks, you too.

60
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,246
I'm just not ready to commit to
something like this.

61
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,090
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,524
Didn't you know I was going to ask
you something like this?

63
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,060
Didn't wanna say no over the phone.

64
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,465
- Right.
- Didn't seem right.

65
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,293
I'm really sorry.

66
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,139
Hi.

67
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:15,875
What's your name?

68
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,281
- Esther.
- Hi, Esther.

69
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,145
I know who you are.

70
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:21,688
You do?

71
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,956
You're the man who Sophie
called you about Dennis.

72
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:27,050
But you don't want him
because your wife's dead.

73
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,657
Who told that?

74
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,023
Dennis.

75
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,655
Jesus.

76
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,531
Jesus is important, but other religions
are just as relevant.

77
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,706
Esther, do me a favor:

78
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:43,198
When you become president, please don't
take away my Social Security.

79
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,113
Are you a friend of his or what?

80
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,136
No.

81
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:52,706
He's a weirdo.
He doesn't have any friends.

82
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,147
He doesn't?

83
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,580
Well, where's he hangin' out?

84
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,916
He's in the box.

85
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,056
He doesn't come out until night.

86
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:07,797
Why does he do that?

87
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,968
The sun.

88
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,970
He hates the sun.

89
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,438
Why does he hate the sun?

90
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:15,669
I don't know.
Because he thinks it's too sunny?

91
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,066
Right.

92
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,541
I told him you were weird.

93
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,445
He is in the box.

94
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,732
But I don't understand,
why did she call you in the first place?

95
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,634
Well, she thought she'd found
a good match for me.

96
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,970
Aren't, like, single men like the
bottom of the totem pole?

97
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,838
Hey. I am not a single man.
I am a widower.

98
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,641
And that is the worst of all worlds.

99
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,446
I am in the ground,
below the totem pole.

100
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:57,283
Well, I think it was really insensitive
of her to call in the first place.

101
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,148
I mean, it's only been two years.

102
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,441
Hey!

103
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,749
- Guys, get off the dog.
- We're just playing.

104
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,457
That dog is like 200 years old in human...

105
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,755
Would you do that to Grandma?!

106
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,931
Guys. Get off!

107
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,933
They drive me nuts and they're mine.

108
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,235
I don't know
why Mary wanted to adopt.

109
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,371
She was adopted herself, and...

110
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,140
Yeah, but it was something you were
going to do together and... you know.

111
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,910
Hey, it's not gonna happen.
You're preaching to the converted.

112
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,512
Okay, good. Because here's
a voice from the trenches:

113
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,148
Parenting is really hard. All right?

114
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,617
It's hard, and you need
at least two people.

115
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,820
Well, we had Mom and Dad.

116
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,688
We had two people and
they hated being parents.

117
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,282
I'm just sayin' there're no guarantees,
there's plenty of single

118
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:43,057
All right. Well, I don't want to see you get hurt.
You could have a kid of rage.

119
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,330
- Kid of rage?
- Yeah, well...

120
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,233
there was a TV movie and
they were crazy.

121
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:51,567
Listen, I got to go take The Omen
One and Two to soccer practice, okay?

122
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,807
So just stay here. You made the right
choice, that was a good decision, okay?

123
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,299
Have some coffee or some food or
something. We have snacks.

124
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,229
Hey, I miss her too.

125
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:10,907
Somewhere, a dog, barked and
then he licked his privates.

126
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,358
What do you think, Somewhere?

127
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,419
You think we could do it alone?

128
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,327
Anybody home?

129
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:37,076
Uh, listen, chief,
I, uh... I brought you some sunblock.

130
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,445
Very strong stuff.

131
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:43,349
SPF forty-five, that's Sun
Protection Factor, and, uh,

132
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,250
helps you against the ultraviolet rays,
which are...

133
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,113
they call 'em the UV rays...
Anyway, it's...

134
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,783
hypoallergenic and waterproof...

135
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,952
I'll just leave it for You

136
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:01,226
- Hi Sophie, how ya doin'?
- Fine.

137
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,097
You good?

138
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,040
Good.

139
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,042
Didn't expect to see you back here.

140
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,374
Yeah, I wanted to bring the kid
some sunblock.

141
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,683
What was that?

142
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,218
It's his Polaroid.

143
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:22,449
He likes takin' pictures.
There's no film in it, he just...

144
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,353
likes takin' pictures.

145
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,054
Just as a point of interest,

146
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:35,827
what made you think I'd be a good match for
a boy who spends most of his time in a box?

147
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,362
He thinks he's from another planet.

148
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,540
- Out!
- Looks great, guys. Thank you.

149
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,350
So, buddy, what do you think?

150
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,648
- Where's the pathos?
- What?

151
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,922
I mean, where's the pathos?
The Earl of Dracoban is dying.

152
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:59,659
This is a guy who's fought
his way across the galaxy.

153
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,729
You see, Rastaban... Rastaban was
a blue dwarf that became a red giant.

154
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:06,799
It's the red dwarf phase of the giant.

155
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,734
What're you ta... Look, I don't know
what I'm talkin' about.

156
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,258
But this I do know.

157
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:13,806
I see a production that is honoring
the world of your book.

158
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,865
Really. Takin' it very seriously.
That's what I see.

159
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,535
Speakin' of your book...

160
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,739
Guess who I got a call from today.

161
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:21,939
Your publisher.

162
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,372
Our publisher.

163
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:24,847
- Tina.
- Tina.

164
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,620
She ask you how
The Revenge of Dracoban is coming?

165
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,554
No, she shouted it.

166
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,813
You know what the problem is?

167
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,548
When I wrote the novel...

168
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,730
there's this giant massacre at the end,
and everybody dies.

169
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,365
- I know.
- All the characters are dead.

170
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,233
- I know, I sold it.
- It's a problem.

171
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,895
That's great. Let's move on
to the massacre scene.

172
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,561
What am I gonna tell Tina?

173
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,200
Tell Tina...

174
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:53,404
that somewhere in the deepest,
darkest bowels of Oastle Septar

175
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,674
the Earl's necromancers...

176
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,475
are bringing him back to life
against his will.

177
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,651
If that's possible. Is that any good?

178
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,249
Sure.

179
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:21,265
It says "Fragile. Handle with care,"
for God's sake.

180
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,511
David... and hello, Earth to David...

181
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:30,816
a kid who sits in a box all day is
a giant red flag. All right?

182
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,909
It's like the equivalent...

183
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:36,489
of buying a used car and ignoring
the oil spill in the driveway.

184
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,091
You know, for a non-writer,
you're becoming the queen...

185
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,752
- of the muscular analogy.
- OK.

186
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:46,023
Listen. The thing about kids...
and I wouldn't trade mine for the world...

187
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,300
is that they keep comin' at ya.

188
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:51,771
All right? They're-They're like mosquitoes
suckin' the life outta you.

189
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,508
They take away your life,
your privacy, your identity.

190
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,976
You should work for Planned Parenthood.

191
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,341
You joke.

192
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:04,583
You forget that whole shelf full-a books you
wrote or your knowledge of Oalifornia wines or...

193
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,485
that you ever ran a marathon...

194
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:09,054
here's the thing, Liz.
I never ran a marathon.

195
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:12,546
I don't want to run a marathon.
I want to do something meaningful.

196
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:13,950
You know?

197
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,728
And I get all the arguments against it.

198
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:19,064
I even get the one says I don't know
if I wanna bring another kid into this world.

199
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:23,228
But how do you argue with the logic
of loving one that's already here?

200
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,740
Trans-fobo-meet-io.

201
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,341
Trans-fobo-meet-io.

202
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,910
Trans-fobo-meet-io...

203
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,901
Trans-fobo-meet-io.

204
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,510
Dennis.

205
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,541
Dennis.

206
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,674
- What're you doing? It's rai...
- I'm waiting for David.

207
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:40,974
What?

208
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,189
The man with UV protection.

209
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,349
Oome in.

210
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,677
Anybody in there?

211
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,309
Brought you somethin'.

212
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,525
Those really help cut out
the glare in your...

213
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,764
...ongoing battle with the sun.

214
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,860
Thank you.

215
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,194
You're welcome.

216
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,535
Quality throw, chief.

217
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,646
Nice to see you.

218
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,850
Very nice to see you, actually.

219
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,556
He's not a puppy in a window,
you know.

220
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,759
I know.

221
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,038
You see, he's been abandoned.

222
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,736
Emotionally abused,
he's classified as hard to place. He's...

223
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,778
never had a family of his own.

224
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:51,276
I know, but am I the right person for him?
I'm just a writer.

225
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,783
He's seen a lot of doctors,
if that's what you mean.

226
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,784
But that's not what he needs.

227
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,696
At least tell me what you're thinking.

228
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,232
I'm thinking I must be out of my mind.

229
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,673
You remembered your sunscreen.

230
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,443
It works just as good
if you don't put so much on.

231
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,014
Is that your weight belt?

232
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,783
Earth's gravity is weak.

233
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,651
Mars is constantly pulling me back.

234
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:37,628
So without all that stuff,
you think you'd just float away?

235
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,658
That ever happen before?

236
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,228
Yes.

237
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,596
When?

238
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,331
With another mommy and daddy.

239
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,114
"Uncommunicative...

240
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,651
a tendency to steal things, inability to

241
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,618
form personal attachments or
distinguish

242
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,780
between right and wrong.
And he thinks..."

243
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,349
He thinks he's from outer space.

244
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:13,498
Not to put too sharp a point on it,
but I think he thinks he's from Mars.

245
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,590
How do you plan to deal with that,
Mr. Gordon?

246
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:19,070
Fantasy is my business.
It's what I do for a living.

247
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,731
And one of the things
I've learned about fantasy,

248
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,936
I mean, in my own life is that
it can be a survival technique...

249
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,445
...you know?
Kind of a coping mechanism.

250
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:32,313
A way to deal with problems
that are bigger than you... bigger than you're...

251
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,449
you're capable of dealing with.

252
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:39,822
Uh, so uh, you know,
the-the-the- the short answer is um,

253
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:43,155
you know, try to find that balance
between socializing him

254
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,631
and letting him be who he is.

255
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:46,996
So, um...

256
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,524
you know, um...

257
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,728
so, you know, on the one hand, uh,

258
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,098
help him out as much as I can

259
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:57,107
and on the other hand,
uh, if he wants to...

260
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,201
if this little guy wants to believe
he's from another planet, you know...

261
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,741
I mean, who am I to argue?

262
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,750
This isn't science fiction,
this isn't a short story.

263
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:09,917
Very often with our children
we don't get to have a second draft.

264
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,080
Yeah.

265
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,449
A single man raising a child with

266
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,926
problems that are not common,
that are not easy...

267
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:21,432
You're gonna need all kinds of help.
You-you'd need to include us. Include me.

268
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,128
- Does anybody have anything?
- No.

269
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,334
We're gonna take some time to think
about this. Thank you, Mr. Gordon.

270
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,703
We'll let you know.

271
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,945
- Hello?
- Hey, man.

272
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:38,383
What's up?
How's things on the planet?

273
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,374
Go away.

274
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,414
What?

275
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,325
- Hello?
- Hey.

276
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,225
Liz, I can't talk right now,
I'm waiting for the call.

277
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,025
But you have call waiting.

278
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,764
But I don't trust it.

279
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,400
Your uncle is nuts.

280
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:14,743
Hello?

281
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,924
Really?

282
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:32,962
Yes!

283
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,670
Oh, my God.

284
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,433
Thanks for comin' out here
with me today.

285
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,136
It's pretty.

286
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,974
I thought you'd like it.

287
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:45,609
It's cool.

288
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,918
I like the holding-down belt.

289
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:53,053
You can wear the holding-down belt
all day long if you like.

290
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:57,651
Listen, Dennis,

291
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:00,061
Mr. Lefkowitz said you can come...

292
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,191
live in my house if you want.

293
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,996
It'd only be temporary at first,
but if you like it...

294
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,572
you could stay.

295
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,778
I eat Lucky Oharms.

296
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:20,975
I am a big believer in
a substantial breakfast.

297
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,676
Got your suitcase, sport.

298
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,076
I got it.

299
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:52,240
Okay.

300
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,449
Go ahead.

301
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,625
You can come through here.
Oh, right over here.

302
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,101
This way, young squire.

303
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,304
Hey! Somewhere!

304
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,940
Hey. S-Somewhere. Somewhere,
down, boy, down, boy.

305
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:26,449
Hey, sorry, that's just Somewhere.
It's just his way of sayin' hello.

306
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,921
We don't have those
where I come from.

307
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,925
Not a dog person, huh?

308
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,667
I was just waiting for the boys
to get home.

309
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,534
W-Well, what is he doing now?

310
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,731
He's just... He's just in his room.

311
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,836
Should I give him some space,
go in there?

312
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,736
I'll call you back, I'll call you back.

313
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:02,910
This is kind of an-a...

314
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:06,684
of an interesting thing.
It's a special night light...

315
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,056
that, as you can see...

316
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,324
it has pictures of the planets and
the solar systems and...

317
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:15,366
see, they kinda spin around.
It's got mirrors

318
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,465
and lights on the bottom and pictures.

319
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,901
That's not right.

320
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,442
Yeah? Well, what do you mean?

321
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:28,805
You'll have to make the ceiling bigger.

322
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:32,140
And you have to make
your planet like this.

323
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,513
You're-You're absolutely right...
For the For it to be accurate,

324
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,180
the-the ceiling would have to be,
I don't know, a hundred feet...

325
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,953
long and the Earth would be
the size of a pea.

326
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,822
Very, very good. How do you know
that much about scale?

327
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:49,261
It took a very long time to get here.

328
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:54,934
A very, very, very long time
to get here.

329
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,670
We can get rid of some
of those old clothes if you want.

330
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:03,008
Or we can keep it till it literally

331
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,606
disintegrates and falls off your body.

332
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,977
That's a good way to go too.

333
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:11,545
That's kinda cool.

334
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,715
I used to be good at video games.

335
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:15,916
It's not a game.

336
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,119
It's not?

337
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,361
Whatever it is, it's cool.

338
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,102
Should I close the door or
should I just leave it open, or?

339
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:28,730
Halfway?

340
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:30,233
Leave it open?

341
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,570
Midway?

342
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:01,332
Just think of it as a bigger box.

343
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,415
All right, Dennis.
I think you're gonna enjoy this.

344
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:19,055
But listen, before we eat,
rules of the house.

345
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,252
First rule: No girls after ten p.m.

346
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,128
Just kidding on that one.

347
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,994
Uh... the first rule is that there...

348
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,499
there really aren't any rules.
You know?

349
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:34,027
Just maybe some basic stuff about...

350
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,439
Got to put a sticker there,
I guess.

351
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:41,034
Listen, maybe we can,
uh, have a...

352
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:46,373
I don't know, more of a guideline more than
a rule that-that we don't um,

353
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:50,578
...wear the sunglasses indoors,
just for navigational purposes.

354
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,757
This is a grilled cheese sandwich. Uh,

355
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,952
I made you a grilled cheese sandwich
'cause I love grilled cheese sandwiches.

356
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:58,427
I think that they're...
you know,

357
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,997
an American classic.

358
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,395
I used to eat these a lot
when I was a kid.

359
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:05,867
I loved 'em.

360
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,645
I eat Lucky Oharms.

361
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:18,881
Yeah, sure, for breakfast
you can have Lucky Oharms...

362
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:23,546
or maybe some granola or yogurt,
any kinda cereal. That sounds great.

363
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,115
So, anyway...

364
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,158
...bon appetit.

365
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,027
Try that.

366
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,107
I eat Lucky Oharms.

367
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,136
Oh, here we go.

368
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,006
Look at that.

369
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:54,213
All right, let's get more because,
you know, you never know.

370
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,277
We gotta stock up.

371
00:25:57,022 --> 00:26:01,823
Never know whether there's gonna be
the avian bird flu or bubonic plague,

372
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:05,224
or any other sort of pandemic is
gonna come along

373
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,863
and gonna wreck your day.

374
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,867
Wanna make sure
you have the right supplies.

375
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:17,943
And this stuff is...

376
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:21,936
This stuff's got a, uh, shelf life of about
thirty-three thousand years.

377
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,749
If anything happened, the, um,

378
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,644
Apocalypse, four horsemen show up...

379
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,790
this stuff is still magically delicious.

380
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,732
We're Lucky Oharms guys.

381
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:48,365
Mary?

382
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,584
Dennis, are you okay?
What're you doing?

383
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:01,150
Watching you.

384
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,347
Oh...

385
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,451
It's a little late for that.

386
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:08,751
Dennis?

387
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,398
Dennis, what're you doing?

388
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,465
Oome on,
let's-let's put the camera away.

389
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:19,435
Dennis, please. Let's put the
camera away. Oome on, now.

390
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:21,535
Beware!

391
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,264
I almost Disneygraded you.

392
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,477
You almost disintegrated me?
Why would you wanna do that?

393
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,346
Hey, it's the, um...

394
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,484
It's the middle of the night, chief.
What're you doin'...

395
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:36,145
with all these pictures?
What're you doin' up?

396
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:37,480
Learning.

397
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,854
Learning? Learning what?

398
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:43,155
How to be a human and part of a family.

399
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:45,823
I think you speak for a lot of us there.

400
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:55,706
That's very good.

401
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,933
It's very realistic.

402
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,276
Um, maybe we oughta...

403
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,545
pick this up in the morning over a bowl
of Lucky Oharms, what d'you say?

404
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,414
Don't you think we should go
to bed now?

405
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:12,078
Yeah, yeah, I saw that. Yeah,
it's a very good expression.

406
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,917
- Yeah?
- Yes, Mr. Gordon.

407
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,549
Hi, Mr. Lefkowitz from Ohildren's Services.

408
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,354
Wh-What? Who?

409
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,830
This is Mr. Lefkowitz from
Ohildren's Services.

410
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,855
Oh, hi. Hello, sir. How are you?

411
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,059
Well, good.
More to the point, how are you?

412
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,799
Oouldn't be better.
Oouldn't be better.

413
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:02,202
Good. How's Dennis? Is there anything
we should talk about?

414
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:04,703
Mr. Gordon?

415
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:06,707
Hello, Mr. Gordon.

416
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,837
Uh, yeah. I'm here.

417
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:10,346
Yeah, hi.
I was asking if... if...

418
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,746
Do you have any concerns about Dennis
that you'd like to talk about?

419
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:15,820
No, no. Everything's going great.
Oouldn't be better, sir.

420
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,594
I think it's time to get you out
of the house.

421
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:05,036
Listen, imagination is a rare commodity.

422
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:07,163
Dennis has the soul of an artist.

423
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:08,836
He could grow up to be, you know...

424
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,669
become a prodigy like...
You saw Amadeus.

425
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:13,642
He could be a little Mozart in
waiting for all you know.

426
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:16,913
Mom, he's being gross.

427
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:20,246
- Oome on.
- Guys, let it go, okay?

428
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:23,218
Remember? It all ends up
in the same place, right?

429
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,653
Oome on, guys.

430
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:29,954
I mean, I want to be sensitive,
but he's a mess.

431
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:31,462
Hey, that's sensitive?

432
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,362
- You should hear blunt.
- No, but really.

433
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:37,302
Listen, my point is that not
everybody is born to be...

434
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,938
a go-with-the-flow,
happy little Gap-kid.

435
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,599
Right now, it looks like
he's gonna grow up to be...

436
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:44,174
Tiny Tim with a ukulele, all right?

437
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,936
What, are you breeding geniuses now?

438
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:51,745
Mozart, by the way,
died in a hovel at 27, drunk and...

439
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,045
Unspecified fever at 35.

440
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,187
Stuff like that.

441
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,657
Sure, we all enjoyed his music,
but did he enjoy himself?

442
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:00,749
Give me a chance.

443
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:01,553
You know, David,

444
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,229
as far as I'm concerned they're all
from Mars. At least your kid admits it.

445
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:05,330
See, this is a smart man.

446
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,319
- That's the correct answer, man.
- Smart man.

447
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:07,830
- You married a smart man.
- I know.

448
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:10,332
I agree they're all from Mars.

449
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,326
Strike two!

450
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,836
Here we go.

451
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:21,943
Strike three!

452
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,837
That was a nice strike-out, huh?

453
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:25,438
It's called a strike-out.

454
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,551
It's pretty cool, huh?
You want a peanut?

455
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:29,446
You know what's really cool
about baseball?

456
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,112
You know what I love about baseball?

457
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,746
Baseball is the only sport...

458
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:35,724
where you can fail 70 percent
of the time and still be great.

459
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,558
It's about trying hard and
never, ever, ever givin' up.

460
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:42,062
Just think about it. If you get a hit three out
of every 10 times you're at bat,

461
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,368
you're really good.

462
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,268
If you do a little bit better than that...

463
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:49,431
just a little bit better than that
maybe 3.2, 3.3 times...

464
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:51,833
you're great,

465
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,736
and you could be a star.

466
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,870
And you're gonna make it
to the Big Show.

467
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,514
And if you do that on the Big Show
you're a superstar.

468
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,909
Superstars don't exist.

469
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:04,480
Only supernovas or white dwarfs.

470
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:08,649
I deserve you. I really do.

471
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:12,656
You're out.

472
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,256
This guy doesn't look like
much of a hitter.

473
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,225
But we believe, don't we?

474
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:21,497
Oome on, now!

475
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,505
Strike three!

476
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:26,132
It's not lookin' pretty.

477
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,075
We're down by seven runs.

478
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:29,637
We're not hittin' a lick.

479
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,045
Oome on, batter.
We need a hit.

480
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:35,986
Yeah!

481
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:37,217
There you go.

482
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,756
Got a single.
Get something started.

483
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:40,551
I did it.

484
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:41,818
You did what?

485
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,319
I made a Martian wish.

486
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:46,955
You made a...

487
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:48,956
You made a Martian wish?

488
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,968
Yeah. Martians can wish for stuff.

489
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,502
Like hits?

490
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:55,238
Whatever.

491
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:59,237
You know, sometimes I make earth wishes
but they don't always work out.

492
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:03,544
Well, listen,
since you're in the wishing mode...

493
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:06,341
see this guy comin' up to the plate?

494
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:08,511
Wish for a home run.

495
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,022
That ball is gone!

496
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,259
Want him to win?

497
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:31,308
Unbelievable.
What an awesome display of power.

498
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:34,004
You're a prognosticator,
you're a scholar...

499
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:36,912
and now you're a baseball fanatic,
and I like it.

500
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,607
Let's hear it for
those Ooal Miners.

501
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:42,877
Unbelievable game.

502
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,387
Unbelievable game.

503
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,257
This isn't looking pretty.

504
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,849
Do you know we spend
an average of two weeks...

505
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:52,521
in a lifetime waiting for traffic lights?

506
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:54,856
I remember when all these lights...

507
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,567
were timed, you know,
when they were synchronized?

508
00:33:56,567 --> 00:34:00,833
And you could just find this little seam
in the universe and float through.

509
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:06,734
Wow. Did you see that?

510
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:08,267
Yup.

511
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,475
I just gave you three minutes
of your life back.

512
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,277
Well, thank you.
I'll use them wisely.

513
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,251
Do that again.

514
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,656
Nope.

515
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,023
Why? 'Oause you don't want to or
'cause you can't?

516
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:26,455
I only have so many Martian wishes.

517
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,225
That's fair.

518
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,699
But if you want,

519
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,636
I can give you one.

520
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,030
Who wouldn't want one?

521
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,726
There, I just gave you a Martian wish.

522
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,688
Don't waste it.

523
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:03,862
I absolutely won't. I promise.

524
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,696
I'll use it
for something really important.

525
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,035
That was really intense.

526
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,772
You're just a freaky little dude, man.

527
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,583
Hey, Somewhere.

528
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:25,852
- This is Harlee.
- Hi.

529
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,658
She's... She's our good friend,
me and Somewhere.

530
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:30,422
She helped design this
whole garden, so...

531
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,530
I've heard a lot about you.

532
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:42,767
You want to say hi?

533
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:44,342
- No?
- It's okay.

534
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,673
Don't worry. Don't worry.

535
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:50,710
Isn't he wild?

536
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:53,842
He's great,
like a little Andy Warhol.

537
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,846
He has the same social skills,
by the way.

538
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,015
You know what I think it is?

539
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:02,414
What?

540
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,418
He's an old soul.

541
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:06,928
What does that mean?

542
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,157
Seriously.

543
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,763
It just means he's figured it out.

544
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:17,041
You're one relentlessly
sunny individual.

545
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,635
Yeah, well,
I don't always wake up that way.

546
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:22,942
And that is
what we so admire about you.

547
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,812
This particular move here that
he's got goin'...

548
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,719
can't be sanitary or safe.

549
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:29,845
He likes to vacuum.

550
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:33,515
No, no, no, he thinks he is the vacuum.
There's a difference, see?

551
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:35,724
That's so Zen.

552
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,151
It is, kind of, isn't it?

553
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:39,127
Yeah.

554
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:41,689
See?

555
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,762
More sunshine.

556
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,469
Keep your hips towards me, though,
if you can.

557
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:51,871
Just move this foot a little towards me.
No, no, not that part of your hips.

558
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,445
Just square yourself up this way.
Right like that, right?

559
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:57,682
And then hand on the bat and, remember,
you're gonna step forward.

560
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,980
When you hit the ball,
you can yell, "Hot coffee!"

561
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:01,507
Say it.

562
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:03,851
- Hot coffee!
- Say, "Hot coffee!"

563
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:06,717
All right, forget it.

564
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:09,121
Seven out of ten times you can fail...

565
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,854
but you're still a star.
A little better than that...

566
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,530
you'll go to the Big Show for
a cup of coffee.

567
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,021
- I like this game.
- I know. It's good, right?

568
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:15,962
It's a great game.

569
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,434
So, eye on the ball and swing.

570
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,500
That was a little late.

571
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:23,666
Watch the ball hit the bat.

572
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:26,541
Watch. Just have your eyes
go right there.

573
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,543
What is with your pitching?

574
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,672
- Here we go.
- Oh!

575
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:31,839
That was a little too early.

576
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:32,780
- But it was so good.
- Yeah.

577
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,407
It was a good form.

578
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,588
Almost, Dennis, that was nice.

579
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,250
All right now,
with fierce determination.

580
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,256
Want to see you, you know,
just groove on it.

581
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:46,330
You know,
get a little attitude.

582
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,466
You know, a little swagger.
You touch the plate.

583
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:49,592
Oome on, you're a lefty.
You're weird,

584
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,362
you're eccentric, nobody understands you.
You don't even understand yourself.

585
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,372
You know what I'm sayin'?

586
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:54,895
Yeah.

587
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:57,338
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about.
Yeah.

588
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,502
Now hands back,
give me the eagle eye.

589
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:00,976
I'm scared.

590
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:02,980
- That's what I'm talkin' about.
- Yeah.

591
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:04,980
Oh! Oh!

592
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,308
Hot coffee!

593
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:08,950
Hot coffee.

594
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,387
Oh! Hot coffee!

595
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:14,117
Yeah, you drove it it down the line.
That's a fair ball! Run!

596
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,159
- Run! Run, Dennis!
- Fair ball! Run!

597
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,024
Drop the bat and run. Run.

598
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:19,926
Run!

599
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:22,693
- Dennis, run.
- Go, run! Run!

600
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,495
- Run!
- Quick!

601
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,069
Oome on now.

602
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:30,538
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

603
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:34,805
What was that for?

604
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,310
Oause they're giving medals to
all the wrong guys.

605
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,095
Hello, my name is Jeff.

606
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,471
Hey, buddy.

607
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:06,066
I'm a friend of your... David's...

608
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,837
um, and I have this present for you.

609
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,845
You're his agent.

610
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,581
Yes, I am.

611
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:16,275
Wow, that's, pfft, very good.
I'm impressed.

612
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,448
Where is, um, David?
Is he inside?

613
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:21,652
Is he inside?

614
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:24,125
Is he writing?
Is he writing inside?

615
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,153
Okay, buddy, listen, I'm...

616
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:27,822
- Hey, Jeff!
- Hey, buddy, how are ya?

617
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,297
Good to see you.
You met... You met Dennis, huh?

618
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,235
Yeah, we've just been getting
to know each other.

619
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:32,497
If he gets hungry...

620
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,595
Lucky Oharms all night long, right?

621
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:36,599
Lucky Oharms.

622
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:37,906
Knuckles?

623
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:40,945
He's not... It takes a while.

624
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,810
Hi. We're gonna go.

625
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,177
See you, buddy.
Nice to see ya.

626
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:47,051
God, I'm so proud of you, man...

627
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,645
- Yeah.
- Re-entering your life fantastic.

628
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:52,012
It's not going very well.

629
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,421
Buddy, you know what?

630
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:58,129
There is a long and proud tradition
of asking for help in the form of a nanny.

631
00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:59,230
- No!
- There's absolutely...

632
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,831
No, there's no shame in that.

633
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:03,061
I'm not talking about...
I'm not talking about Dennis. He's fine.

634
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,261
I'm talking about, you know
the book's not going particularly well.

635
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:08,896
What... What's, um...
What's going on with the book?

636
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,338
Does that mean like
sagging-in-the-middle not good or what?

637
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:12,807
- No.
- Like the ending? Ya havin' a hard time...

638
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,706
noodling the ending? Oan I help you?
Is there anything I can help...

639
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,779
No, no, it's just that
there's an essential idea...

640
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,081
I haven't come to grips with.

641
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,311
But you know the great thing
about Dennis?

642
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,719
He is a fountain of ideas.

643
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,221
He is challenging all my assumptions,
all of them...

644
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:26,457
every one of them,
and I am going with it.

645
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:28,755
I just got to learn to be
a little less rigid.

646
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:30,060
Or a little more rigid.

647
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,823
Yup, it's great.

648
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,328
I'm so excited...

649
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:35,564
that you're figuring out the rigidity...

650
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:38,061
but, buddy, I am livin'
The Revenge of Dracoban...

651
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:41,502
on a daily basis and the forces of darkness
are closin' in on me, man.

652
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:42,528
Tina's coming to town.

653
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,698
- Oh, God.
- Yeah, she's havin'

654
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,038
...a big black tie party for you...

655
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:46,200
- and she expects you to...
- Party?

656
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:49,143
Ritualistically hand over
to her the first draft...

657
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,172
ever written of The Revenge of Dracoban
Part Two, the sequel.

658
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:54,479
- When?
- About six weeks from now.

659
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,318
You know, so that's it.

660
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,755
- When?
- January 28th.

661
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:59,290
She's doing it January 28th.

662
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,656
- What is the significance of that date?
- I don't know.

663
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:03,627
She's doing a book signing or
something that night.

664
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,729
- The book signing at the Museum of...
- Jesus.

665
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,492
I got to get a sitter!

666
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,934
Buddy, are you losin' your mind?

667
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:10,593
No.

668
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,603
Because if you are I just need
a little bit of lead time.

669
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,834
- Don't you think I deserve that after all these years?
- Don't worry.

670
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:21,969
You sure you don't want me
to come in with you?

671
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:23,343
Yes.

672
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,472
Yes, come in?

673
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,677
No. Don't come in.

674
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,052
Don't come in.

675
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,781
You need the umbrella?

676
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:30,955
Yes.

677
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:33,651
And the weight be
It's an absolutely essential item?

678
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:36,958
Okay.

679
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:39,628
You're gonna have
a great first day.

680
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,461
Dennis. Dennis. Dennis.

681
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,737
Listen, just...

682
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,040
Just be yourself.

683
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:56,007
That's all you got to do, okay?

684
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,083
Dennis, Dennis, Dennis, Dennis.

685
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,056
That way.

686
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:33,983
Hey, retard.

687
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,578
You little punks.

688
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:42,855
Oh, Jesus!

689
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,427
Sir, is there a problem?

690
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:46,258
Uh, no, no, no...

691
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:48,831
not at...
I'm just here to watch.

692
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:50,830
Yeah, that's a problem.

693
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:55,862
No, this is a total misunderstanding.
This is not what it appears to be.

694
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,529
Do you...

695
00:42:58,008 --> 00:42:59,443
I'm a new parent.
That... That...

696
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:01,434
He's my... He's my son...

697
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:04,174
and it's his first day
and I was really concerned.

698
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:05,909
I came to check on my daughter.

699
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,280
That's my baby
right there in the brown.

700
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:11,286
- Driving the, uh...
- Mm-hmm.

701
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,817
Which one's yours?

702
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:18,921
Over off on the side there
hanging upside down.

703
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:20,690
Weirdo.

704
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:24,031
Good luck to you, sir.

705
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,066
Yeah.

706
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:28,236
He says he's counteracting earth's
gravitational pull...

707
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:31,968
because it impedes
the blood flow to his brains.

708
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:33,134
That's what the yogis believe.

709
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:34,979
Yogis don't have to
go to second grade.

710
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:37,812
Hey, there's no harm in being
a little eccentric.

711
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,176
This I know.

712
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:45,019
So, he thinks he's from Mars...

713
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,558
and you write about Mars,
that's great.

714
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:50,857
A little Martian chose you to teach him
about being human.

715
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:55,225
Oome on. He came to earth to
document our existence.

716
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:59,503
Listen, when I was 11 years old,
I saw The Sound of Music...

717
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:01,937
and from that moment on,
I was convinced...

718
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,041
I was the lost von Trapp sister.

719
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:05,065
You?

720
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:08,643
I was always waiting for Julie Andrews
to turn up with her guitar...

721
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:10,680
and get me the hell out of West Oovina.

722
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:13,407
Yeah, but did you go to school
in lederhosen?

723
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,243
Yes, I did.

724
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:16,913
That's a good look for you.

725
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,482
- He's a sweet little boy...
- Yeah.

726
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,057
But, uh,

727
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:25,423
he's not like the others.

728
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,094
Really?

729
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,593
The, uh, social worker says
he has above average intelligence...

730
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:35,536
but, you know, I guess
it just takes time for him to adjust.

731
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,372
He steals from the other children.

732
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,911
- Steals?
- We find things in his cubby'.

733
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:46,505
Shoes, pencils, retainers.

734
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,520
Um, you know,
Dennis has a really curious mind...

735
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,544
and I think he just really needs...

736
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:52,556
- You know, he's on his own kick where he wants...
- You know, if it were only...

737
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:54,854
If it were only about the stealing but...

738
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:58,026
Dennis needs special attention...

739
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:00,159
that we're simply
not equipped to offer here.

740
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,324
What do you mean you're
not equipped to offer?

741
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:04,892
I'm sorry.

742
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:06,429
About what?

743
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,435
What are you saying? You're saying
you're throwing him out?

744
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:18,676
Well, that's really...

745
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:22,542
That's really cold.

746
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,455
- Mr. Gordon.
- Hi.

747
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:29,148
Dennis and I had a nice, long chat.

748
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:30,726
Good. How'd that go, pal?

749
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:33,493
I'm an intelligent being.

750
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:34,963
I completely agree.

751
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,063
Um, why don't you and I chat?

752
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:42,072
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You want to wait here?

753
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,044
What do I do for Dennis?
I mean, to...

754
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:53,539
Do what you're doing.

755
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:56,512
You know, you got to give
this some time.

756
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:58,255
You know, doctor,
I'm really concerned.

757
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:01,358
I mean, he's not making
any friends...

758
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:04,261
and he's not relating to me
particularly well...

759
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,530
and he just got expelled from
school for stealing...

760
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,930
and he's a very isolated little guy.

761
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:12,696
And when he, uh, you know, when he's
vulnerable and scared like that,

762
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,028
I just...

763
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:17,038
I mean, when he tells me
he thinks he's gonna float away.

764
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,978
He probably thinks
he's gonna float away...

765
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:22,673
because he's very smart...

766
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:28,275
and he sees that he's living in a world where
things and people do disappear.

767
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,555
I could give him a prescription,
but, honestly,

768
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:34,746
I...

769
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:39,718
I think that seeing
how another intelligent being...

770
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:43,391
keeps his feet on the ground
would be far more therapeutic for Dennis.

771
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:47,396
Mr. Gordon, all parents feel like...

772
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,735
they're the blind leading the blind.

773
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:51,773
Sure.

774
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,039
Listen, pal,
I got to talk to you about something.

775
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:57,381
Um, after Ohristmas break,

776
00:46:57,381 --> 00:46:59,372
we're gonna start a new school.

777
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:01,846
And I want to see how
you feel about it...

778
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:06,288
because that can be kinda scary,
startin' a new school and,

779
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:10,117
you know, your teacher thinks
it's a good idea and so do I.

780
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:11,653
And, um...

781
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,360
It's good to measure things, huh?

782
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:19,533
Anyway, how do you feel about it?

783
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:21,672
You okay to take a fresh start?

784
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,663
Take a fresh run at a new school?

785
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:30,002
Would you be up for that?

786
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:36,679
What are you looking at?

787
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:38,979
That's where they found me...

788
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:42,419
on the grass by the big,
round building.

789
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:44,259
It was raining.

790
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:49,524
You know what's weird is that
was so long ago...

791
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,498
I would think you couldn't remember it.

792
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:53,997
I couldn't, so how could you?

793
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:57,407
They'll come back someday to get me.

794
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:59,034
Like, like summer camp?

795
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,733
You don't believe me.

796
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:03,904
So Martians can read minds, too, huh?

797
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:07,716
Martians can do lots of things you can't.

798
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:10,616
Besides changing traffic lights,
what can you do?

799
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:13,113
We can taste color.

800
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:15,557
Okay.

801
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:17,424
You can taste color.

802
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:18,519
Prove it to me.

803
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,122
Off with the glasses,
close your eyes.

804
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:27,929
They said this would happen.

805
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:29,165
Open up.

806
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,376
Open... Don't-You were lookin'.

807
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,002
You were totally lookin'.

808
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,574
Right, open up. Here we go.

809
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:39,640
What color is it?

810
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:48,453
- Red.
- All right, but that one doesn't count...

811
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:52,320
because we had obvious
ethical complications.

812
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:54,221
Open up.

813
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:02,205
Green.

814
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,168
Very good.

815
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:08,838
Open up.

816
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:14,941
Yellow.

817
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:16,779
Yes, it was.

818
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,550
This one?

819
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:27,161
Well?

820
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:30,029
I can't taste it.

821
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:31,168
It's blue.

822
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:34,365
I know. I can't taste blue.

823
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:42,869
A little too bright?

824
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,739
Shade it back up.

825
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,846
Oome, Flomar.

826
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:56,158
Did you just call Somewhere "Flomar"?

827
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:59,821
It's Martian for "warm, furry friend."

828
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:01,494
He picked it.

829
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:03,433
Oh.

830
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:13,568
- You want to get a glass of water for you?
- No. No, thank you.

831
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,270
Where do you...
Where do you want him to sit?

832
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,248
Hey, it doesn't matter.
Anywhere you want.

833
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:20,117
- Be laissez-faire about it, right?
- Okay.

834
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:22,915
Does he have turkey or
should I get some Lucky Oharms?

835
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,217
I don't know.
Ask boy wonder over there.

836
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:28,216
Okay.

837
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,063
Hey. Hey, Dennis.

838
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:35,691
Do you want to have some turkey with us?

839
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:39,224
I can't eat anything grown on
Saturn's moons.

840
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:43,305
Well, then, I think you're safe here.

841
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:45,307
That'll be great.

842
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,003
Okay, buddy?

843
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:54,579
You ever notice how far apart
his eyes are actually set?

844
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:55,510
No.

845
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,555
Or that his ears are
just a little bit pointy?

846
00:50:58,555 --> 00:50:59,886
Little bit.

847
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,457
David?

848
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:07,125
All this time I was thinking that
I was no good as a father, right?

849
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:10,065
And that, you know,
I was working the Mars as a metaphor angle.

850
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:12,829
But then I was thinking to myself
what if that's not it?

851
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:18,241
What if he actually really is imbued,
you know with some special...

852
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,799
You know, he could be a little medium.

853
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:21,367
- David, you're hysterical.
- I know.

854
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:23,947
See, everybody says,
"Don't be hysterical."

855
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:26,211
But I say, "Why not be hysterical?"

856
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,649
Hysterical is the new calm.

857
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:30,087
My wife dies, boom...

858
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,355
I go out and I adopt
a kid from Neptune.

859
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:35,525
Should I just chill, or should I be
hysterical? You tell me.

860
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:37,828
I think hysteria is a way of life.

861
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:39,429
It's a clothing line at least.

862
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,231
I could stop writing not that
I'm writing anyway.

863
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:42,459
David,

864
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:44,856
I'm... I'm worrying about you.

865
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:46,026
Why?

866
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:50,263
Because I think what's really going on here
is you guys are really struggling.

867
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,799
You think I don't know that?

868
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:55,938
I know that.

869
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:03,286
You know,
you're still in a trial period. I mean...

870
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:06,380
You can return him like a
defective toaster, right?

871
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,023
Is that what you mean?

872
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,828
I... I guess what I'm trying to
say is that I...

873
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:19,102
I know you see a lot of yourself in him but,
David, I was there.

874
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:24,438
You were weird, and you had problems
but this kid is in a whole other league.

875
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:28,638
You know, what is so amazing about
you is that you're right.

876
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:31,548
You're always right and
you remember when you're right...

877
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:34,016
and you never let anybody else forget it.

878
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:36,678
I'm gonna just go out for a minute.

879
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:39,817
Hey, come on, Dennis.

880
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:42,723
Let's get out of here.

881
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,728
Gee, this was fun, huh?
A little later...

882
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:47,197
- I can make you some Lucky Oharms or something.
- David? David.

883
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:48,164
David, don't.

884
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:50,665
- That's okay. Well, you know, whatever.
- Oome on, it's Ohristmas.

885
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,328
- Of course, it is.
- You know? Where... Where you going?

886
00:52:57,874 --> 00:52:58,898
Oome on.

887
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:03,146
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

888
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:04,738
Well, "trial period," is that a code?

889
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:06,049
Okay.

890
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:07,551
You Know? I know.

891
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:09,109
I, You know what? I, I...

892
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:10,380
It's okay. Everything's cool.

893
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:12,318
- I was just trying...
- You know, I'm just tired.

894
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:15,656
But it's Ohristmas, David.

895
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:17,624
- No. We'll come over tomorrow.
- Just relax.

896
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:20,287
We'll come over tomorrow, okay?

897
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:06,730
Jesus! Dennis.

898
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:09,906
Was I bad?

899
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:12,636
No, you weren't bad and
you got to stop saying that, all right?

900
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:14,733
I don't want you to cut your feet.

901
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:16,401
And Daddy's...

902
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,404
I'm in here working.

903
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:22,218
We got to put this camera away for
a little while, okay?

904
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:23,913
But I haven't finished my mission.

905
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:25,818
Well, you have for today.

906
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:29,058
But I haven't finished my mission!

907
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,727
Give me my camera back!

908
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:32,752
I need it!

909
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:35,325
You got to calm down.

910
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:37,890
I have to go to work,
or you can go to your room.

911
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:41,993
You're gonna send me
away, aren't you?

912
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:45,237
Dennis, why would I send you away?

913
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:50,741
Because you're mad at me
because I broke your stuff.

914
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:54,012
Dennis, I don't care about
any of that stuff.

915
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,580
This is stuff.

916
00:55:57,754 --> 00:56:00,746
There's nothing you can do
that would ever change the way I feel.

917
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,052
Do you understand?

918
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,226
Not gonna ever send you away.

919
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:09,831
Look, this is just stuff.

920
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:28,643
Oome on, break it like you mean it.

921
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:31,647
One more. Let it go, buddy.

922
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:35,257
Here's two. Oh, just one.

923
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:38,728
Nice one!
Over the head over the head, big time.

924
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,389
Like the Greeks.

925
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,759
That feels so good.

926
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:44,834
No, not that plate!

927
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:46,136
I got an idea, but we'll still have fun.

928
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:47,728
We'll still have fun.

929
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,676
I'm sorry. I'm just trying to have...

930
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:56,513
I'm just trying to have...
I'm so sorry.

931
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:58,310
I was just trying to have fun, buddy.

932
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:12,128
I will wail on you!

933
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:13,686
This is war!

934
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,697
This is war!

935
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:28,537
Just stay here.

936
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:43,259
Hey, Mr. Lefkowitz, uh, come on in.

937
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:45,523
Uh, what a surprise. Happy holidays.

938
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:47,095
Thank you. You, too.

939
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:51,463
Uh, we were just, uh, having, uh...

940
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:57,470
just having some fun. Sort of a,
uh... It's a breakthrough, you could say.

941
00:57:57,907 --> 00:57:59,242
Nice to see you.
Very, uh,

942
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:02,302
vigilant of you to come
during the holidays.

943
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:04,747
I heard there was
a little trouble at school.

944
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:06,180
Just a little trouble.

945
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,042
Nothing we can't handle.

946
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:09,812
Right?

947
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:13,311
Would you mind very much
if Dennis and I went up to his room?

948
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:16,655
Maybe he could show me his room.
We could chat for a bit.

949
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,320
No, I wouldn't mind.
Would you mind?

950
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:23,326
Would that be okay, Dennis?

951
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,600
- I think it's okay with Dennis.
- Good.

952
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:30,027
Where's your room, Dennis?

953
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:31,504
It's downstairs.

954
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:32,735
He'll show you.

955
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:34,432
Thank you.

956
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:40,509
- Following you.
- Jesus.

957
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:50,660
Everything all right?

958
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,821
Hey, you knew about this stuff?

959
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:56,329
Uh, we're just gonna turn
that off real quick.

960
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,393
Yeah, yeah, sure,
we're, we're, um...

961
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:00,868
Have you seen this?

962
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:02,839
Yeah, yeah,
I know all about this.

963
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,831
This is a science project that
we're working on.

964
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:08,511
Kind of a whole transformation
and decay kind of a thing.

965
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:11,014
We take all the stuff from the house
and we put it in the baggies.

966
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:14,711
We take photos of it, and we put it away
then we come back to it.

967
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:17,220
Uh, Dennis and I...
Uh, Dennis mostly...

968
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,085
He'd study how it's...

969
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:21,724
- See, we're doin' it right now.
- Oar keys.

970
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,259
Sure. You know, car keys.

971
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:25,352
- Yours?
- Yeah, they are.

972
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:26,861
Passport, yours?

973
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:30,059
I knew about that, too. It's amazing
how much a passport can decay.

974
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:32,001
Everything's good. Everything's fine here.
Everything's great.

975
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:33,491
We just try to do the things and see...

976
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:35,371
how they have transformed and
decayed or not. Sometimes they don't.

977
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:39,102
- Lf... we could just talk in private.
- Yeah.

978
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:42,603
Good. Excuse us one second, Dennis.

979
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:44,840
- Outside.
- Please.

980
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:48,144
I'm just a little bit concerned here,
Mr. Gordon.

981
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:52,689
You seem to suffer from a syndrome
many adopting parents experience.

982
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:53,917
Shock?

983
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:57,549
You're so eager to become the child's friend
you forget to be a parent.

984
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:59,527
And Dennis needs a parent right now.

985
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:02,998
He needs a strong role model. He needs
someone to bring him down to earth.

986
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,792
He's been stealing again.

987
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,497
He's been expelled from school.

988
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:08,972
I think "expelled" is a harsh word.

989
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:12,408
I think there was a consensus reached
that it wasn't the right place for him.

990
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,637
Yeah, a consensus includes me.

991
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:18,046
The principal gave me no option.
I... I should have called,

992
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:20,145
and I apologize for that.

993
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,816
I'm gonna move
your case up for a review.

994
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:24,781
You'll be notified by mail.

995
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:26,855
I'll let myself out.

996
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:32,824
Mr. Lefkowitz, I do know...

997
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:37,332
that there's no one on this planet
that loves Dennis any more than I do.

998
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:39,795
I know that.

999
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:53,013
These pictures are mine.

1000
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:56,347
And they're really important to me.

1001
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:59,386
And I need to understand
why you took 'em.

1002
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:01,555
Will you tell me?

1003
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:04,026
Please, I need you to tell me.

1004
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,027
Because you love her so much.

1005
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:18,196
Ahem, that's really true...

1006
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:22,771
but that doesn't change the way
I feel about you, pal.

1007
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:26,172
Not even a little.

1008
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:33,856
You know, Mr. Lefkowitz isn't sure...

1009
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:36,620
that it's such a good idea that
you stay here...

1010
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,153
so we gotta make him happy.

1011
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:44,426
So when you're here at home,
it's okay to be from Mars.

1012
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:48,660
But when you're out there
with the rest of the earthlings...

1013
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:51,303
you know,
you gotta go by earth rules.

1014
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:53,005
But...

1015
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:59,645
what we will never do is
we will never, ever, ever...

1016
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:03,981
ever, ever, ever give up.

1017
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:06,621
Winston Ohurchill said that,
I think.

1018
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:09,523
There's one other thing.

1019
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,527
It's really serious.

1020
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:17,029
Will you please teach me
how to do that disidney-grate thing?

1021
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:20,932
How you do it?

1022
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:24,337
You'll get it.

1023
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:37,086
We have to do this.

1024
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,187
I can't. You do it.

1025
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:41,850
I think it should be
this shirt with these.

1026
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,824
Okay.

1027
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:46,855
It looks hot on you.

1028
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,999
He'll look devastating.

1029
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:52,263
He will. He will. That's fine.
That's fine.

1030
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:53,335
Right?

1031
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:55,972
What age do they start
making fun of you...

1032
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:57,337
if you wear the wrong clothes?

1033
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,807
- You know, like, uh, What... Fifth grade?
- Fifth grade?

1034
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:04,778
That's when I started wearing my
rainbow-colored leg warmers every day.

1035
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:08,518
Pretty much solidified my role as the weird girl
who sat in the back of class...

1036
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:10,782
drawing Smurfs until ninth grade.

1037
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:13,646
What happened in ninth grade?

1038
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:15,451
I grew breasts.

1039
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:17,951
That woulda done it for me.

1040
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:20,261
My God, childhood is barbaric.

1041
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:21,957
I know, it's tough.

1042
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:24,266
But...

1043
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:26,593
But what?

1044
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:30,171
Maybe it's not supposed to be easy.

1045
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:33,208
I mean, maybe the ones who have it easy
they're missing part of the adventure.

1046
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:37,013
Don't you think
all the truly fascinating people...

1047
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:39,315
in the world probably had
dysfunctional childhoods?

1048
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:42,113
You sold me. I'm gonna send him to school
in the rainbow-colored leg warmers.

1049
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:43,708
- Please don't.
- I will.

1050
01:03:43,786 --> 01:03:45,413
I'm not that fascinating.

1051
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:51,660
Uh, thing about it is
I just worry about him all the time.

1052
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:53,558
It's the curse of being a parent.

1053
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:57,834
I think Dennis is happier than
he's been in a long time.

1054
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:58,801
Yeah.

1055
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:04,095
I think you are, too.

1056
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:16,143
I should go.
It's late, and I'm tired.

1057
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:19,279
Do you want me to make some coffee
for the ride home or something or...

1058
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:21,622
or you could just stay here.

1059
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:23,722
In the guest bedroom.

1060
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,550
You don't have a guest bedroom.

1061
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:27,391
That's right.
Best you were on the couch.

1062
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:30,797
I didn't... Believe me, that That's not
what I meant. That was the furthest...

1063
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:32,668
furthest thing from my mind.
Really.

1064
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:34,237
Oh, really? The furthest?

1065
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:36,967
Well, not the furthest thing from
my mind. It's just...

1066
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:40,770
...things that are a little further away
like smallpox or, you know.

1067
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:42,201
It's really...

1068
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:43,880
I gotta go.

1069
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,648
I gotta go feed the goldfish.

1070
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:46,979
The goldfish?

1071
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:49,678
I'm taking care of
my neighbor's goldfish.

1072
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:51,020
Your neighbor's.

1073
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:53,011
- Yes.
- I see.

1074
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:57,617
They need to get fed.

1075
01:04:58,427 --> 01:04:59,724
Goldfish, huh?

1076
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:10,363
- Good night.
- Yeah.

1077
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:16,736
- You okay?
- Uh, yeah. Are you okay?

1078
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:18,180
I don't know.

1079
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,807
You are. You look okay.

1080
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,384
- So do you.
- Okay. Bye.

1081
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:22,282
You look great.

1082
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:23,352
- What?
- You look good.

1083
01:05:23,352 --> 01:05:24,546
Oh, you, too.

1084
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:39,599
You look great.

1085
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:41,129
Great.

1086
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:44,266
It's a cloudy day.

1087
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:47,337
I know. That's why you don't need
all that sun block.

1088
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:49,839
I do have a little bit
of bad news, though.

1089
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:53,007
We're gonna have to do without
the holding-down belt.

1090
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,683
But I'll float away.

1091
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:58,551
I don't know much,
but I know this.

1092
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:00,646
You will not float away.

1093
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:03,521
- Promise?
- Guarantee it.

1094
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,125
But you know... Oome on.

1095
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:07,630
You know,
what I was gonna tell you is...

1096
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,657
I don't know if I ever told you this
but when I was a kid, I used to pretend

1097
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:13,495
like I was from another planet.

1098
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:15,401
Why did you do that?

1099
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:17,838
Well, I was going to a new school
and I was nervous...

1100
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:20,103
and I wanted people to like me...

1101
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:23,479
and, you know,
I was afraid I wouldn't fit in and...

1102
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,174
Did you wear a hat?

1103
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:28,876
Yeah.

1104
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:31,153
Yeah, sometimes I did 'cause it was
Ohicago, and it was cold...

1105
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:33,087
so sometimes I wore a hat.

1106
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:36,555
You shouldn't have worn a hat.

1107
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:39,929
There it is.

1108
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:42,227
Well, anyway, after a while...

1109
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:45,901
I learned to be a little bit
more like everybody else...

1110
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:48,563
and to fit in a little bit.
And you know what?

1111
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:51,971
It wasn't so bad.
It really wasn't so bad.

1112
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:55,334
Is it good to be like everyone else?

1113
01:06:56,979 --> 01:06:58,810
That's a really good question.

1114
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:03,785
Which is usually what adults say
when they don't have the answer.

1115
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:07,645
I think what's important right now
to remember...

1116
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:10,426
is that you need to learn stuff.

1117
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:12,328
About human beingness.

1118
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:13,761
Exactly right.

1119
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:15,754
Instead of, you know...

1120
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:17,124
Human Martianness.

1121
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:20,635
Which you already know
a lot about, right?

1122
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,638
Hi, Miss Margie.

1123
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:24,640
- Mr. Gordon, hi.
- Nice to see you.

1124
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,164
Do you remember Dennis?

1125
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:28,771
- Hello, Dennis.
- Miss Margie.

1126
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:31,343
Don't worry.
We're all very nice here.

1127
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:34,707
Hey, listen, pal.

1128
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:38,354
If you feel like you're nervous or
you can't handle it...

1129
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:41,846
I'm gonna be right out there
and you can come get me in the car.

1130
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:47,719
What if I don't feel good after
you leave?

1131
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:50,727
Well, you can come get me.
I'll be there all day.

1132
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:55,265
- All day?
- Mm-hmm. All day.

1133
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:59,034
Okay. Your daddy has to go now, Dennis.

1134
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:04,775
Okay, here you go, pal.

1135
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:09,050
We're a little nervous 'cause we
don't have our weight belt today.

1136
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:12,453
We're havin' gravity issues.
Okay, pal.

1137
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:05,508
"And the radios crackled up and down the line
as the fighter lords received the command...

1138
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:08,136
"and turned to their soldiers instructing...

1139
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:10,440
"Fall where you stand.

1140
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:13,377
"Fall where you stand."

1141
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:20,347
And that is enough of Dracoban
for one night.

1142
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:23,954
Good night, sweet prince.

1143
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:56,952
Nice talk.

1144
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:06,221
David!

1145
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:08,626
- David!
- Yeah!

1146
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:13,665
I'm coming!

1147
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:20,971
Dennis, you okay, pal? What's wrong?
What's wrong? What's wrong?

1148
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,602
Flomar.

1149
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:27,682
Somewhere?

1150
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:35,152
What's wrong with him?

1151
01:11:36,725 --> 01:11:38,522
Oh, Somewhere.

1152
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:40,627
What happened?

1153
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:42,855
Is he okay?

1154
01:11:44,266 --> 01:11:45,699
No, no.

1155
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:47,297
He died.

1156
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:50,265
Died?

1157
01:12:00,215 --> 01:12:01,682
Damn it.

1158
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:47,795
Hey, let's go for a ride. Let's go for a ride.
Let's get out of here.

1159
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:49,454
We'll go look at the stars.

1160
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:50,897
Oome on, pal.

1161
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:55,070
When I was a little boy like you
I used to think when you lost somebody...

1162
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:57,506
they would go up there in the stars
and you can't see 'em anymore...

1163
01:12:57,506 --> 01:13:00,031
but you can talk to 'em,
and they can hear you.

1164
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:04,071
Is that why you were crying...

1165
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:07,046
because you won't see
Flomar anymore?

1166
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:12,953
When you love somebody it's really hard
when you can't see 'em anymore.

1167
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,127
Do you talk to Mary?

1168
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:25,196
In a way I do, yeah, all the time.

1169
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:30,834
That's probably why I come out here.

1170
01:13:35,944 --> 01:13:37,878
I can see Mars.

1171
01:13:38,313 --> 01:13:40,873
Get out. Where? I can't see it.

1172
01:13:41,483 --> 01:13:43,474
Oh, that's a good eye.

1173
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:50,120
What do you think of when you see Mars?

1174
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:53,451
That my mission is almost over.

1175
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,796
I'll be going back soon...

1176
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:58,766
and then everything will
go back to normal.

1177
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:01,935
Dennis, can I just say
one last thing about Mars...

1178
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:04,239
which may be strange
coming from a science fiction writer...

1179
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,434
but, right now, you and me, here...

1180
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:08,466
put together entirely from atoms...

1181
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:11,547
that have been part of millions of other
organisms before they became us...

1182
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:16,211
sitting on this round rock with
a core of liquid iron...

1183
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:19,685
held down by this force,
that so troubles you, called gravity...

1184
01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:23,156
all the while spinning around the sun
at 67,000 miles an hour...

1185
01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:27,024
and whizzing through the Milky Way
at 600,000 miles an hour...

1186
01:14:27,062 --> 01:14:31,600
in a universe that very well may be chasing
its own tail at the speed of light.

1187
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,194
And amidst all this frantic activity...

1188
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:38,504
fully cognizant of our own imminent demise
which is a very pretty way of saying...

1189
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:40,599
we all know we're gonna die...

1190
01:14:41,276 --> 01:14:44,245
we reach out to one another.

1191
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:47,716
Sometimes for the sake of vanity...

1192
01:14:47,716 --> 01:14:51,049
sometimes for reasons you're not
old enough to understand yet...

1193
01:14:51,186 --> 01:14:54,155
but a lot of the time
we just reach out

1194
01:14:54,556 --> 01:14:57,320
and expect nothing in return.

1195
01:14:58,727 --> 01:15:00,456
Isn't that strange?

1196
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:03,395
Isn't that weird?

1197
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,566
Isn't that weird enough?

1198
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:11,936
What the heck do you need to be
from Mars for?

1199
01:15:28,657 --> 01:15:30,818
So, look,
we're just gonna talk to 'em...

1200
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:36,728
and we're gonna tell 'em about all of the
human stuff we like to do, and,

1201
01:15:37,299 --> 01:15:39,961
you know it'll be over before
you know it...

1202
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:42,700
and everything will be fine.

1203
01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:44,538
Okay, deal?

1204
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:50,576
Oause if I'm myself
they won't let me to stay with you.

1205
01:15:53,515 --> 01:15:54,812
No. No, no.

1206
01:16:06,361 --> 01:16:08,591
Whatever you say,
it's gonna be okay.

1207
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:15,626
I love you very, very much.

1208
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,940
Ah, you got your ankle weights there.

1209
01:16:26,114 --> 01:16:27,342
Be yourself.

1210
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:30,050
- Oome on.
- Hey.

1211
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:32,281
- Hi, Sophe.
- Hi.

1212
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:34,646
You gonna come with me? Huh?

1213
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:36,354
It's gonna be okay.

1214
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:39,721
Let me go get some coffee here.
It's all all right.

1215
01:16:47,903 --> 01:16:52,897
So, Dennis,
how you getting along at school?

1216
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:55,637
Okay.

1217
01:16:56,878 --> 01:16:59,108
Is there something you want to
tell us about?

1218
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:01,609
No.

1219
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:06,349
You don't seem very happy today, Dennis.

1220
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:10,814
I'm stellar.

1221
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:23,001
So, um, all this moving from school to school
how's that been for you?

1222
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:25,535
Mm, there's been some rough times...

1223
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:31,307
but the important thing is to, um,
you have to face your problems...

1224
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:37,015
and you should never ever, ever, ever...

1225
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:39,855
ever, ever give up.

1226
01:17:39,855 --> 01:17:43,518
Never ever, ever, ever.

1227
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,728
Winston Ohurchill said that...

1228
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:49,455
I think.

1229
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:52,296
Winston Ohurchill,
he was a very smart man, huh?

1230
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:56,260
Hey, Dennis,
when we've spoken before...

1231
01:17:56,371 --> 01:17:58,807
you... you said that you were from
another planet.

1232
01:17:58,807 --> 01:17:59,808
Mars.

1233
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:01,105
Mars, right.

1234
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:03,569
Zepper nicki whawok.

1235
01:18:03,945 --> 01:18:06,277
Trans fobo medio.

1236
01:18:12,287 --> 01:18:14,823
Sometimes it's okay to pretend...

1237
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:16,848
and sometimes it isn't.

1238
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:20,085
So you... You were just pretending?

1239
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:26,128
And then I started doing science...

1240
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:30,193
and I realized we were
spinning around the sun...

1241
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:36,871
at 67,000 miles an hour...

1242
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:39,805
held in place by gravity.

1243
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:43,640
So what the heck do
I need to be from Mars for?

1244
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:46,854
I think it was because I didn't fit in.

1245
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:53,321
And then I started to learn
how to be like everyone else.

1246
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,664
Dennis, did, um...

1247
01:18:56,998 --> 01:19:01,697
Did Mr. Gordon coach you on...
on what to say here today?

1248
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:04,732
He only coached me on one thing.

1249
01:19:04,773 --> 01:19:06,206
What's that?

1250
01:19:07,042 --> 01:19:11,546
If you hit three out of ten,
you're a star.

1251
01:19:11,546 --> 01:19:14,879
If you get even a little better than that...

1252
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:18,852
a little better than that,
you're a superstar.

1253
01:19:21,656 --> 01:19:23,817
You get a cup of coffee.

1254
01:19:25,861 --> 01:19:27,556
Hot coffee.

1255
01:19:33,335 --> 01:19:35,200
Well, how'd it... How'd it go?

1256
01:19:35,303 --> 01:19:37,794
I told them about baseball.

1257
01:19:37,839 --> 01:19:38,771
You did?

1258
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:40,866
Then I told them about hot coffee.

1259
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:42,711
You didn't? Did you really?

1260
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:44,646
- Mr. Gordon.
- Yeah?

1261
01:19:44,646 --> 01:19:46,045
Oongratulations.

1262
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:49,309
Thank you.

1263
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:51,315
Sophie.

1264
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:17,369
We are highlighting the search for extra
solar planets here at the observatory.

1265
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:19,767
And, well, as many of you know,
the Draco system...

1266
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:22,605
is, uh, the prime focus of the search.

1267
01:21:22,911 --> 01:21:25,313
And, well, who better to talk about it
than David Gordon,

1268
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:27,649
whose sci-fi best-seller Dracoban...

1269
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:31,551
has brought this exciting search into
the public eye.

1270
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:32,678
David.

1271
01:21:32,787 --> 01:21:33,845
Thank you.

1272
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:38,522
Let's see.

1273
01:21:38,627 --> 01:21:40,151
Uh, thank you.

1274
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:42,597
I was fascinated with seeing Draconis...

1275
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:45,293
because it was a system...

1276
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:48,598
that could closely mirror
our solar system...

1277
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:54,538
No planet has been the subject of more
romantic speculation than Mars.

1278
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:56,845
At one point,
it was commonly believed...

1279
01:21:56,845 --> 01:22:00,148
that Mars was inhabited by
an ancient civilization...

1280
01:22:00,148 --> 01:22:03,140
that had dug an intricate system
of irrigation channels...

1281
01:22:03,285 --> 01:22:05,387
and the annual darkening of the planet...

1282
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:08,556
was interpreted as the growing
season of plant life.

1283
01:22:08,556 --> 01:22:12,327
But the flyby missions of Mariner I,
VII, and VIII...

1284
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:14,429
showed that the irrigation system...

1285
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:17,398
was nothing but an enormous
network of canyons...

1286
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:21,027
and the famous darkening due to
annual dust storms.

1287
01:22:21,069 --> 01:22:23,629
Soil samples taken by the Vliking landers...

1288
01:22:23,705 --> 01:22:28,074
showed a complete absence of organic material
from the planet's surface.

1289
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:31,442
In other words,
there is no life on Mars.

1290
01:22:33,648 --> 01:22:38,449
No planet has been the subject of more
romantic speculation than Mars.

1291
01:22:38,486 --> 01:22:41,148
At one point,
it was commonly believed...

1292
01:22:53,535 --> 01:22:56,470
This is not how I remember it.

1293
01:22:56,504 --> 01:22:58,233
This isn't it.

1294
01:23:07,615 --> 01:23:10,209
I think I'm from a different Mars.

1295
01:23:15,123 --> 01:23:16,358
Are you angry with me?

1296
01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:20,590
No, I'm not angry with you, I just thought
we agreed that you weren't...

1297
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:22,860
gonna be from Mars.

1298
01:23:22,897 --> 01:23:25,422
Jesus, I can't even say that
word anymore.

1299
01:23:25,867 --> 01:23:29,098
I thought I was pretending so
we could stay together.

1300
01:23:29,237 --> 01:23:32,035
No. Oome on, pal.

1301
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:34,609
You don't believe I am from Mars...

1302
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:35,844
- do you?
- Oh, come on, Dennis...

1303
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:38,779
I think that sometimes
you think you are, okay?

1304
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:41,116
- Stop!
- No, no. You stop, Dennis.

1305
01:23:41,116 --> 01:23:43,107
- I mean, it's...
- The car!

1306
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:52,927
I'm so sorry, officer. I was having
a conversation with my son...

1307
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:54,929
and I didn't...
I turned the corner.

1308
01:23:54,929 --> 01:23:55,997
I'm really sorry.

1309
01:23:55,997 --> 01:23:57,465
Driver's license, please.

1310
01:23:57,465 --> 01:23:59,763
I usually have it right here.

1311
01:24:02,737 --> 01:24:05,205
Dennis, did you take
my driver's license?

1312
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:08,541
Freen-awa-blee-meet-ia.

1313
01:24:10,078 --> 01:24:12,447
Dennis, I'm asking you a question.
I need you to answer me.

1314
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:14,176
Did you take my driver's license?

1315
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:16,080
This is serious, okay?

1316
01:24:16,184 --> 01:24:17,452
Freen-awa-blee-meet-ia.

1317
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:20,114
Dennis! Answer the question!

1318
01:24:20,255 --> 01:24:22,450
Freen-awa-blee-meet-ia.

1319
01:24:22,657 --> 01:24:23,851
Dennis, you took my license!

1320
01:24:23,925 --> 01:24:25,620
No, I didn't!

1321
01:24:26,528 --> 01:24:27,756
Dennis!

1322
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:32,097
I didn't steal it!

1323
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:40,972
What did you do with her pictures?

1324
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:43,445
I didn't steal 'em. I need them.

1325
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:45,504
Oh, come on, man!

1326
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:47,649
That's not fair!
We talked about all this!

1327
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:49,017
Stop. Those are mine.

1328
01:24:49,017 --> 01:24:52,009
It's not your stuff,
Dennis! It's my stuff!

1329
01:24:52,987 --> 01:24:53,955
Stop.

1330
01:24:53,955 --> 01:24:55,252
Dennis,

1331
01:24:56,124 --> 01:24:59,127
adults get their feelings hurt
just like little boys.

1332
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:00,651
This is my stuff.

1333
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:03,195
Stop.

1334
01:25:03,231 --> 01:25:04,493
No!

1335
01:25:04,632 --> 01:25:06,065
Stop!

1336
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:15,435
Go ahead. Go ahead.

1337
01:25:16,578 --> 01:25:18,239
Why don't you?

1338
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:30,423
Trans fobo medio. Trans fobo medio.
Trans fobo medio. Trans fobo medio...

1339
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:44,405
Trans fobo medio. Trans fobo medio.
Trans fobo medio. Trans fobo medio...

1340
01:25:44,405 --> 01:25:45,633
- Dennis, Dennis.
- Trans fobo medio.

1341
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:48,470
- Dennis, Dennis, stop.
- Trans fobo medio.

1342
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:52,002
You're not a Martian.
You're just a little boy.

1343
01:25:57,051 --> 01:26:00,111
And maybe I can't help you.
Maybe I'm not cut out for this.

1344
01:26:04,425 --> 01:26:07,690
Stay here and just...
Just cool out for a minute.

1345
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:27,412
Look, it's just gonna be like, you know
I'm gonna show my face for twenty minutes...

1346
01:26:27,549 --> 01:26:29,717
- Hey, no. Take your time.
- Then get back on the road.

1347
01:26:29,717 --> 01:26:32,253
Take your time.
Do what you gotta do, you know?

1348
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:33,720
Don't worry about us.

1349
01:26:33,755 --> 01:26:35,456
- Okay.
- Great.

1350
01:26:35,456 --> 01:26:36,824
Thanks for watching him.

1351
01:26:36,824 --> 01:26:38,519
Oh. It's...

1352
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:40,755
You're my brother.

1353
01:26:41,596 --> 01:26:43,063
He's my nephew.

1354
01:26:49,103 --> 01:26:50,229
Dennis?

1355
01:26:50,505 --> 01:26:53,133
Hey, wow. That is cool.

1356
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:55,835
Listen, I'm gonna finish cleaning up
the kitchen...

1357
01:26:55,877 --> 01:26:58,279
and call Nicholas and
Jonas and check in on them...

1358
01:26:58,279 --> 01:27:02,045
and I thought then I can come back
and hang out, okay?

1359
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:04,309
All right, big guy?

1360
01:27:04,586 --> 01:27:06,178
I'll be back.

1361
01:27:08,856 --> 01:27:10,517
Oongratulations.

1362
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:11,626
Who is this handsome fellow?

1363
01:27:11,626 --> 01:27:13,595
I look like Ohairman Mao.

1364
01:27:13,595 --> 01:27:14,929
That's right. You brought
your Little Red Book.

1365
01:27:14,929 --> 01:27:17,420
- Oh, that's hideous.
- Louie. Louis?

1366
01:27:17,465 --> 01:27:19,228
Louie, right here, snappy snap.

1367
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:25,198
Welcome to the big time, Mr. Gordon.

1368
01:27:25,506 --> 01:27:26,905
Tina.

1369
01:27:28,443 --> 01:27:30,011
- I was wondering about you.
- So lovely to see you.

1370
01:27:30,011 --> 01:27:31,876
You wouldn't be the first.

1371
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:38,113
Everybody, this is David Gordon
and he is brilliant.

1372
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:44,448
And I see he's brought me
a little present.

1373
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:46,861
This is the first draft of
his new book.

1374
01:27:46,861 --> 01:27:49,762
And let me tell you,
it did not come cheap.

1375
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:52,291
- Ah, David.
- Yeah?

1376
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,493
I'd like to introduce you to Leonard.

1377
01:27:54,535 --> 01:27:56,435
He's the head of our marketing.

1378
01:27:56,604 --> 01:27:57,338
Nice to meet you.

1379
01:27:57,338 --> 01:27:58,600
He's absolutely brilliant.

1380
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:00,107
- Yeah?
- Welcome to the club.

1381
01:28:00,141 --> 01:28:02,143
Tina likes to surround herself with
brilliant people.

1382
01:28:02,143 --> 01:28:03,508
I can see that.

1383
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:09,311
Well, shall we just give this manuscript
to my assistant for safekeeping?

1384
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:10,084
Linus.

1385
01:28:10,084 --> 01:28:13,054
Tina, actually, could I speak with you
in private for a moment?

1386
01:28:13,054 --> 01:28:16,820
There's just... I have something
I need to talk to you about.

1387
01:28:17,558 --> 01:28:20,288
Uh, listen, this might be a little awkward.

1388
01:28:20,328 --> 01:28:22,096
That's my least favorite word.

1389
01:28:22,096 --> 01:28:23,085
I'm sure.

1390
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:24,499
Uh, well, could you
take a look at this?

1391
01:28:24,499 --> 01:28:26,734
I just want to talk to you
'cause it's a little...

1392
01:28:26,734 --> 01:28:28,827
different situation here than
I imagined.

1393
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:30,997
Martian Ohild?

1394
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:32,563
- What's this?
- Is that the alternate, uh...

1395
01:28:32,607 --> 01:28:33,539
alternate title idea, buddy?

1396
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:35,843
I thought we agreed on
The Revenge of Dracoban.

1397
01:28:35,843 --> 01:28:38,243
Yes. Yes, we did. Um...

1398
01:28:39,414 --> 01:28:42,817
but I must say it's more than
just a title change.

1399
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:46,054
So this is the, um,
quantum alternate universe?

1400
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:47,521
- Shut up.
- An idea that...

1401
01:28:47,555 --> 01:28:50,625
I tried to write Dracoban.
I really, really, really did.

1402
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:51,626
Well, what's the problem?

1403
01:28:51,626 --> 01:28:53,428
I adopted a boy.

1404
01:28:53,428 --> 01:28:56,591
Adopted this very fantastic,

1405
01:28:57,198 --> 01:29:00,301
difficult young man and
he is very much alive...

1406
01:29:00,301 --> 01:29:01,703
and those characters were dead,
and I had to do this.

1407
01:29:01,703 --> 01:29:04,035
No, we have a contract.

1408
01:29:04,205 --> 01:29:06,341
We paid you a substantial amount.

1409
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:08,070
I know, I know, I know, I know.

1410
01:29:08,109 --> 01:29:09,744
And I'II, um, ahem...

1411
01:29:09,744 --> 01:29:12,180
I'll write the other one,
or I'll just pay you back.

1412
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,511
It's unacceptable.

1413
01:29:13,548 --> 01:29:15,516
I'll refinance my house
if that's what it takes. I don't care.

1414
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:17,040
I don't want the money.

1415
01:29:17,085 --> 01:29:19,387
I want a Harry bloody Potter in space.

1416
01:29:19,387 --> 01:29:20,955
That's what I paid for.

1417
01:29:20,955 --> 01:29:25,324
Leonard created an extremely expensive
marketing campaign around this book...

1418
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:29,194
and Dracoban is the cornerstone
of that campaign.

1419
01:29:30,431 --> 01:29:32,899
I can't do anything without that.

1420
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:36,600
Do you comprehend
what I am telling you?

1421
01:29:36,637 --> 01:29:39,572
You get that, don't you, buddy?
Do you understand that?

1422
01:29:40,908 --> 01:29:44,605
Why can't you just be
what we want you to be?

1423
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:02,491
I got it.

1424
01:30:03,631 --> 01:30:06,327
Beware. Beware. Beware.

1425
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:09,895
What time is it? I'm so sorry.

1426
01:30:10,004 --> 01:30:13,667
I'm gonna write the other thing.
I'm gonna make this up to you, I promise.

1427
01:30:14,108 --> 01:30:15,943
You're gonna get a whole series,
rivers of blood...

1428
01:30:15,943 --> 01:30:17,812
but just read that because it's good.

1429
01:30:17,812 --> 01:30:19,013
It's really good.

1430
01:30:19,013 --> 01:30:22,346
And I have to go,
but this was great and I'm sorry.

1431
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:33,951
Hey, Dennis!

1432
01:30:34,662 --> 01:30:36,823
What do you say, um...

1433
01:30:36,998 --> 01:30:41,662
to some hot chocolate or...
or somethin'?

1434
01:30:42,003 --> 01:30:44,062
Does that sound kinda good?

1435
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:47,873
Or... Tang?

1436
01:30:48,242 --> 01:30:50,311
Do you know what Tang is?

1437
01:30:50,311 --> 01:30:54,111
It's... It's something that
the astronauts drink.

1438
01:30:54,148 --> 01:30:55,843
Might like that.

1439
01:31:13,034 --> 01:31:14,023
Liz!

1440
01:31:19,006 --> 01:31:20,166
Liz!

1441
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:21,933
Liz!

1442
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:23,211
- We just... We just
- What happened?

1443
01:31:23,211 --> 01:31:24,678
Can't find him.

1444
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:25,947
- You can't find him?
- He was fine.

1445
01:31:25,947 --> 01:31:28,643
Everything was fine. He was in
his room, and I went to get him...

1446
01:31:28,683 --> 01:31:30,651
- some hot chocolate.
- It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

1447
01:31:30,685 --> 01:31:32,320
- It's okay.
- Then we just called the police...

1448
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,309
- Where... Where's...
- just to make sure.

1449
01:31:33,354 --> 01:31:35,049
Where's the last place you saw him?

1450
01:31:43,965 --> 01:31:45,296
He's nowhere in the house.

1451
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:47,995
Are you sure?
You checked everywhere?

1452
01:32:00,815 --> 01:32:02,578
It's so beautiful.

1453
01:32:03,551 --> 01:32:05,985
Maybe he is a little Mozart.

1454
01:32:11,225 --> 01:32:12,954
What does it mean?

1455
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:17,822
Means goodbye.

1456
01:32:18,966 --> 01:32:21,264
Hey, Harlee, just stay there.
Stay in the car, okay?

1457
01:32:21,302 --> 01:32:22,436
Did you find him?

1458
01:32:22,436 --> 01:32:24,734
No, no, but I know where to go.
Oan you drive me?

1459
01:32:24,772 --> 01:32:25,602
- Yes.
- All right.

1460
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:28,476
I can get the police to move their car.

1461
01:32:28,476 --> 01:32:29,306
No. Don't worry about it.

1462
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:30,278
- Okay.
- Okay.

1463
01:32:30,278 --> 01:32:31,836
All right. Oall me.

1464
01:32:31,979 --> 01:32:34,243
Put your seat belts on!

1465
01:32:39,687 --> 01:32:41,621
- You go that way, and I'II...
- David.

1466
01:32:45,626 --> 01:32:48,322
- Oh, My god
- Talk to him. Go, go, go, go.

1467
01:32:50,731 --> 01:32:52,323
Dennis, stay where you are!

1468
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:54,500
David's coming to get you...

1469
01:32:54,535 --> 01:32:56,503
so just don't move, okay?

1470
01:33:26,033 --> 01:33:28,035
Don't... Really,
just don't walk, sweetie.

1471
01:33:28,035 --> 01:33:30,162
You gotta just try to stay still.

1472
01:33:36,811 --> 01:33:37,778
Dennis.

1473
01:33:43,317 --> 01:33:44,215
Dennis?

1474
01:33:44,418 --> 01:33:46,682
Dennis. Dennis, stop movin'.
Here I come.

1475
01:33:47,054 --> 01:33:48,222
Dennis, I'm comin' to get you.

1476
01:33:48,222 --> 01:33:51,123
Just... Just... Just stay still.
Please, please.

1477
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:53,020
Dennis, stop movin'.

1478
01:33:54,195 --> 01:33:55,662
They're here.

1479
01:33:57,732 --> 01:34:01,532
Dennis, hold on, pal!
I'm comin'!

1480
01:34:01,836 --> 01:34:03,736
Why are you here?

1481
01:34:04,372 --> 01:34:06,431
You can't come with me.

1482
01:34:07,208 --> 01:34:08,266
Okay.

1483
01:34:12,013 --> 01:34:14,038
Give me your hand.
I'm gonna take you home.

1484
01:34:14,615 --> 01:34:17,846
No. I have to go back now.

1485
01:34:18,653 --> 01:34:20,712
My mission is over.

1486
01:34:21,922 --> 01:34:23,014
Dennis, stop.

1487
01:34:23,424 --> 01:34:25,722
Please stop moving.

1488
01:34:26,927 --> 01:34:30,197
They're here.
They came back for me.

1489
01:34:30,197 --> 01:34:32,667
It's a helicopter, Dennis.
We've all been lookin' for you.

1490
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:35,795
It's not a helicopter. It's not.

1491
01:34:38,472 --> 01:34:41,498
Okay. Dennis, give me your hand.
I'm gonna take you home.

1492
01:34:41,542 --> 01:34:43,510
I am going home.

1493
01:34:44,111 --> 01:34:46,011
I don't belong here.

1494
01:34:46,147 --> 01:34:47,079
Okay.

1495
01:34:52,987 --> 01:34:54,716
Put the suitcase down...

1496
01:34:55,423 --> 01:34:58,324
and hold onto
the edges really tight...

1497
01:34:58,359 --> 01:35:00,623
and I'll wait with you until
they come, okay?

1498
01:35:12,673 --> 01:35:14,538
I'm sorry, David.

1499
01:35:15,843 --> 01:35:17,333
What are you sorry about?

1500
01:35:17,912 --> 01:35:20,380
I'm sorry that I have to leave...

1501
01:35:20,681 --> 01:35:21,648
but...

1502
01:35:22,516 --> 01:35:26,247
I'll tell them about baseball...

1503
01:35:26,954 --> 01:35:28,751
and Lucky Oharms...

1504
01:35:31,025 --> 01:35:33,118
and Flomar.

1505
01:35:33,227 --> 01:35:37,323
Yeah. You can tell 'em about
all the stuff we did...

1506
01:35:37,431 --> 01:35:39,092
and how much fun we had.

1507
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:44,138
Dennis, look at me.

1508
01:35:44,138 --> 01:35:46,207
Tell 'em about all the fun stuff
we did...

1509
01:35:46,207 --> 01:35:48,198
and, you know,
how much fun we had.

1510
01:35:49,009 --> 01:35:51,569
You can tell 'em
how hard you tried...

1511
01:35:52,012 --> 01:35:54,242
you know, to fit in,
to be like all of us.

1512
01:35:56,283 --> 01:35:58,274
Human beings can be kinda cruel...

1513
01:36:04,725 --> 01:36:07,523
I promise I'll tell 'em
you were nice to me.

1514
01:36:08,229 --> 01:36:09,196
Thanks.

1515
01:36:11,665 --> 01:36:13,189
You're a great human, Dennis.

1516
01:36:13,234 --> 01:36:16,965
That's the funny part and I just wanted
you to feel like you belong to me...

1517
01:36:17,037 --> 01:36:19,733
cause that's what I think
you really want underneath all this.

1518
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:21,799
I think you want to belong to someone.

1519
01:36:25,579 --> 01:36:27,740
I wish we could have more time together.

1520
01:36:28,182 --> 01:36:31,515
I want to prove to you
that not all parents disappear forever.

1521
01:36:38,926 --> 01:36:41,224
Why do they go sometimes?

1522
01:36:44,331 --> 01:36:45,923
I don't know. That's a...

1523
01:36:50,704 --> 01:36:51,762
I don't know.

1524
01:36:52,072 --> 01:36:54,308
That's a mystery.
Sometimes it's their fault,

1525
01:36:54,308 --> 01:36:57,766
and sometimes it's not.
It's a... It's a mystery. I don't know.

1526
01:37:11,425 --> 01:37:13,689
Why? Why?

1527
01:37:15,262 --> 01:37:18,026
Why do you think they left me?

1528
01:37:35,649 --> 01:37:36,843
Because...

1529
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:41,749
Because they were stupid!

1530
01:37:42,156 --> 01:37:45,751
Whoever let you go those were
the stupidest beings in the universe.

1531
01:37:46,026 --> 01:37:49,257
I mean, they were so dumb they couldn't even
see what was right in front of 'em.

1532
01:37:49,930 --> 01:37:52,266
How could they not see
how extraordinary you are...

1533
01:37:52,266 --> 01:37:53,790
how big your heart is?

1534
01:37:56,470 --> 01:37:58,405
I'm not even that smart,
and I can see it.

1535
01:37:58,405 --> 01:37:59,804
It's so obvious.

1536
01:38:00,641 --> 01:38:02,905
I mean, you're the easiest kid
in the world to love.

1537
01:38:03,444 --> 01:38:04,911
Well, to me, you are.

1538
01:38:07,147 --> 01:38:08,478
You know what I think?

1539
01:38:10,284 --> 01:38:12,081
I think you love me, too.

1540
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:15,021
Like you're just filled with it.

1541
01:38:16,056 --> 01:38:18,650
Think it's just waiting to
burst out of you.

1542
01:38:21,996 --> 01:38:24,123
Dennis, you're my son.

1543
01:38:24,598 --> 01:38:27,431
You're my home, forever.

1544
01:38:28,002 --> 01:38:31,665
And I will never, ever, ever...

1545
01:38:31,939 --> 01:38:33,531
ever, ever...

1546
01:38:34,575 --> 01:38:37,408
ever, ever, ever...

1547
01:38:38,846 --> 01:38:40,040
leave you.

1548
01:38:45,786 --> 01:38:48,016
Okay. I got you.

1549
01:38:50,157 --> 01:38:51,624
I got you.

1550
01:38:52,626 --> 01:38:53,923
I got you.

1551
01:38:59,433 --> 01:39:01,901
Hey, Dennis,
I got my Martian wish.

1552
01:39:07,274 --> 01:39:09,469
- Oh, my God.
- It's okay.

1553
01:39:12,112 --> 01:39:15,673
Sometimes we forget that children
have just arrived on the earth.

1554
01:39:15,983 --> 01:39:18,042
They are a little like aliens
coming into being...

1555
01:39:18,085 --> 01:39:20,454
as bundles of energy and
pure potential...

1556
01:39:20,454 --> 01:39:22,649
here on some kind of exploratory mission...

1557
01:39:22,723 --> 01:39:26,124
and they're just trying to learn
what it means to be human."

1558
01:39:26,627 --> 01:39:30,393
For some reason, Dennis and I reached out
into the universe and found each other

1559
01:39:30,731 --> 01:39:32,961
we'll never really know
how or why...

1560
01:39:33,233 --> 01:39:35,793
and discovered that
I can love an alien...

1561
01:39:35,836 --> 01:39:37,531
and he can love a creature...

1562
01:39:38,105 --> 01:39:40,335
and that's weird enough for both of us.

1563
01:39:51,151 --> 01:39:53,619
Two, three. Hold on!

1564
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:55,856
Oome on, one more,
one more, one more.

1565
01:39:55,856 --> 01:39:58,222
One, two, three.

1566
01:39:58,926 --> 01:40:00,018
Was that good?
