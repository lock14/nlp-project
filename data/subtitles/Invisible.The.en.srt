00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,958
"We wove a web in childhood,
A web of sunny air.

2
00:00:07,958 --> 00:00:11,599
"We dug a spring in infancy
Of water pure and fair.

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,640
"We sowed in youth a mustard seed,

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,237
"We cut an almond rod;

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,440
"We're now grown up to riper age -
Are they withered in the sod?

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,719
"Are they blighted failed and faded,

7
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:25,838
"Are they moulded back to clay?

8
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:30,719
"For life is darkly shaded;
And its joys fleet fast away."

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,679
What the hell is going on?

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,560
Qui sont ces gens?!

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,439
They'll tear us limb from limb.

12
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:43,920
I've crossed the Arctic
and seen nothing like it.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,920
Down on them! Instantly! Run!

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,439
Know you that I give into your
protection - but not for your own -

15
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:55,359
these mortals whom
you hold in your hands.

16
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,838
What's yours called? Wellesley.
This is Gravey.

17
00:00:58,838 --> 00:01:00,798
Because he looks a bit grave.
Mine's called...

18
00:01:00,798 --> 00:01:04,037
Waiting Boy. Is it? Why?

19
00:01:04,037 --> 00:01:07,879
Because he's a queer looking little
thing, Anne. Much like yourself.

20
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:11,597
Look who's talking. This is Sneaky.

21
00:01:11,597 --> 00:01:15,158
Thou art under my protection.
I will watch over thy life,

22
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:19,638
for I tell you all - one day...
you shall be kings.

23
00:01:19,638 --> 00:01:21,117
Yes!

24
00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:33,758
BELL TOLLS

25
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,317
"Dear Ellen.
It was ten o'clock when I got home.

26
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:06,718
"I found Branwell ill.

27
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:11,318
"He is so very often these days,
owing to his own fault.

28
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:14,598
"I was not therefore surprised at
first, but when Anne informed me of

29
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:18,437
"the immediate cause of his present
illness, I was greatly shocked."

30
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:25,639
Charlotte! How was the journey?
Pleasant.

31
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,997
How was Miss Nussey? Well.

32
00:02:27,997 --> 00:02:29,158
Did my box arrive safely?

33
00:02:29,158 --> 00:02:32,997
In our room, we took it up,
me and Emily. What's...? Branwell.

34
00:02:32,997 --> 00:02:36,319
He's been drinking.
He's had a letter. From Mr Robinson.

35
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,878
This last Thursday.
He's been dismissed.

36
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:42,079
How does he do it?

37
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:46,920
It's every job he's ever had.
I know, but this is different. How?

38
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,319
Nothing was spelled out
in the letter. But he...

39
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:52,997
Him and Mrs Robinson...

40
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:56,718
I had reason to know
that they were...

41
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,079
carrying on.

42
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,878
With one another. And I don't know,
I can only assume,

43
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:03,960
that Mr Robinson's found out,
and that's what it's about.

44
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,277
Carrying on? How?

45
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,919
Congress? Mr Robinson's wife?

46
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,800
It's why I resigned.
I couldn't look people in the face.

47
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
I've known for months.
Papa doesn't know.

48
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,277
He just knows he's been dismissed,

49
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:20,117
he doesn't know why.
Emily does. I told her.

50
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:23,598
And of course we don't know
that IS the reason. Where is Emily?

51
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:26,437
You must have some idea
what this is about!

52
00:03:26,437 --> 00:03:28,960
You think repeating the question
enough times, over and over,

53
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,759
is suddenly going to make me
able to answer it?

54
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,520
And if not then someone
must write to the man

55
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,598
and ask for an explanation!

56
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:38,199
He hates me! He's not going
to give any kind of an explanation.

57
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,920
It's an excuse to get rid of me!

58
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,598
He's a monster, he's a bully, he's
a law unto himself. He's an idiot.

59
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,319
Why does he hate you? Why does
he need a reason to get rid of you?

60
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,399
Because he's old, he's ill
and he's jealous of me!

61
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,117
No, no, no.
That doesn't make any sense!

62
00:03:56,117 --> 00:03:58,800
There must have been
a misunderstanding.

63
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,997
Has someone misrepresented you
to him?

64
00:04:00,997 --> 00:04:03,199
Just... GOD!

65
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:08,437
This HOUSE! Just go to bed and stop
asking me fucking questions!

66
00:04:08,437 --> 00:04:10,399
If you don't like this house,
don't stay in it.

67
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:12,878
There's none of us'll miss you,
not when you're like this.

68
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,079
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED!

69
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,480
Tell him.

70
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,680
Branwell's been at it.

71
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,480
With his employer's wife.

72
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,079
She was lonely.

73
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,800
She was lonely!

74
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,079
THE CHILDREN YELL

75
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,680
'Tis a shame you're embarked on this
course of myopic self-destruction,

76
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,800
for I imagine you and I might -
under better circumstances -

77
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,319
have made very stimulating
company for one another!

78
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:55,840
I despise everything you stand for!
Revolution is in the air!

79
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,399
Only a fool like you, sir,
would ignore it!

80
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,959
If the parson and your Aunt Branwell
were in,

81
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:06,240
you'd noan make so much din!

82
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,160
They all think you're right quiet

83
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,759
and studious down
in t'village, y'know!

84
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,800
YELLING CONTINUES

85
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,759
Mr Brown's here.

86
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,439
"Another outrage
has happened in Ireland.

87
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,879
"A party of Orangemen at Armagh,
on the 12th,

"unhappily disregarding
the advice given them,

89
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:45,119
"of abstaining from processions..."
Are you fit, lad?

90
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:48,040
Yeah, I'm just...

91
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,920
"..conducting themselves
with propriety."

KNOCK AT DOOR

93
00:05:54,558 --> 00:05:56,360
John's here. We're off.

94
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:00,920
Don't get up.
No, no. I'd like to see him.

95
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,439
How are you today, John?
I'm very well, thank you, Mr Bronte.

96
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,040
Good, good.

97
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,399
Well, travel safely.

98
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:15,600
Picked a fine day for it, eh?

99
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:20,639
You, er, look after yourself.

100
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:24,319
Thank you.

101
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,920
Well...

102
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:44,680
I think, with kindness
and understanding and prayer,

103
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,399
we might still be able...

104
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:52,759
in spite of his naivety
and...his nonsense...

105
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:57,800
..be able to get him back
onto a proper path.

106
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,800
Will you bring us all something
back from Liverpool, Father?

107
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,639
You behave yersen.
And then we'll see.

108
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
You dozy bastard.

109
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,839
Getting caught.

110
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:26,119
"Anne left her situation at Thorp
Green of her own accord, June 1845.

111
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:27,720
"Branwell...left.

112
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:31,360
"We are all in decent health
only that Papa

113
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,279
"has a complaint in his eyes
and with the exception of Branwell,

116
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,119
"and merely desiring that everybody
could be as comfortable as myself

"we should have
a very tolerable world of it."

119
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,720
They've set off.

120
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,558
Good. Call me old-fashioned,

121
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,720
but I think it's nice
having everybody back at home.

122
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,319
In theory. What happened?

123
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,360
You heard the shouting.
I had my pillow over my ears

124
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,920
so I didn't catch the details.
Lucky you.

125
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,680
So he's...been mucking about,

126
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,119
and by way of punishment,

127
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,920
he's packed off on holiday
for a week with Martha's father?

128
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,839
Packed off on holiday for a week,
or got shot off for a few days.

129
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,680
It's all a question of
how you might choose to look at it.

130
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,079
Tabby. Well, if that's how you feel.

131
00:08:48,197 --> 00:08:50,957
Do you still write stories?
Sometimes.

132
00:08:52,557 --> 00:08:53,639
About Gondal?

133
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,197
When we can.

134
00:08:57,918 --> 00:09:01,477
Emily as well? You've been here
with her more than I have, surely.

135
00:09:01,477 --> 00:09:03,357
We never talk about it.
Never?

136
00:09:16,197 --> 00:09:18,238
Do you? Write?

137
00:09:18,238 --> 00:09:20,238
Still? Not so much.

138
00:09:20,238 --> 00:09:22,317
What about the infernal world?

139
00:09:22,317 --> 00:09:24,597
I relinquished my pen.

140
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,000
Why? Because it frightened me.

141
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,557
Threatened to make
the real world seem...

142
00:09:30,557 --> 00:09:33,678
pointless.
And colourless and drab.

143
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,158
And that way lies madness.

144
00:09:38,238 --> 00:09:41,238
You know, the real world is what it
is, but we must live in it, so...

145
00:09:41,238 --> 00:09:45,158
You should write, if it makes you
happy. I worry about my eyes.

146
00:09:47,158 --> 00:09:50,519
And I think, as well...
when I got that reply from Southey -

147
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:53,957
"Literature cannot be the business
of a woman's life."

148
00:09:57,278 --> 00:09:58,759
At the time I brushed it off.

149
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:01,798
But the longer I've dwelt on it,
the older I've got,

150
00:10:01,798 --> 00:10:03,238
the more I've thought...

151
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:06,717
..what's the point?

152
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,120
The point...for me...

153
00:10:13,918 --> 00:10:16,077
..I'm never more alive
than when I write.

154
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,519
You're the same, surely.

155
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,639
But with no prospect of publication?

156
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:25,038
It's just playing at it, isn't it?

157
00:10:28,597 --> 00:10:30,399
Are we playing then, or what?

158
00:10:32,077 --> 00:10:35,038
Does it ever bother you
that we might be getting...

159
00:10:35,038 --> 00:10:36,837
a bit old? For that.

160
00:10:40,357 --> 00:10:43,077
You weren't saying that
two weeks ago in York. No, well...

161
00:10:44,038 --> 00:10:46,437
I didn't want to spoil things
in York.

162
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,678
It's something
I've been thinking for a while.

163
00:10:52,437 --> 00:10:55,437
Well, what did you come out
with me for then? To talk.

164
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:59,437
What about? Things. At home.
Do you never think about...?

165
00:11:00,597 --> 00:11:01,639
What?

166
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,557
The future!

167
00:11:04,557 --> 00:11:06,437
What are we
without Papa and Branwell?

168
00:11:06,437 --> 00:11:08,879
Papa won't... He won't live forever.

169
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,077
And he's blind,
and that house, our house,

170
00:11:11,077 --> 00:11:13,477
it belongs to
the Church trustees, not us.

171
00:11:13,477 --> 00:11:15,759
And Branwell! What's he doing?

172
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,717
What's he thinking
that he has such a hopeless grasp

173
00:11:18,717 --> 00:11:21,077
on the realities of what comes next?

174
00:11:21,077 --> 00:11:23,759
Are we nothing to him?
Does he even see us?

175
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:26,238
If we don't make
something of ourselves,

176
00:11:26,238 --> 00:11:28,639
and God knows we've been trying,

177
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,837
I've been trying...

178
00:11:29,837 --> 00:11:33,197
I was a governess at that
ludicrous place for five years!

179
00:11:34,678 --> 00:11:37,798
What will we do, Emily?
What will...

180
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:39,317
What will we be?

181
00:11:43,798 --> 00:11:46,477
It was when I came back
from Roe Head.

182
00:11:46,477 --> 00:11:48,918
And he was there, at home,
Branwell.

183
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,437
And he wasn't supposed to be.

184
00:11:53,957 --> 00:11:56,837
You'd gone. You and Charlotte.
You'd gone off back to Roe Head.

185
00:11:56,837 --> 00:11:58,879
And he was supposed to be in London,

186
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:01,597
trying to get his foot in the door
at the Royal Academy.

187
00:12:03,197 --> 00:12:06,597
That's when I knew
what a liar he was.

188
00:12:06,597 --> 00:12:09,197
Sharpers? Thieves! So what?

189
00:12:09,197 --> 00:12:12,918
They attacked you? You were robbed?
Four of them?! I think four.

190
00:12:12,918 --> 00:12:15,317
In broad daylight? That's...

191
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,597
Well, surely someone saw
what happened?

192
00:12:17,597 --> 00:12:20,437
You didn't even get there? No!

193
00:12:20,437 --> 00:12:22,759
It was just after I arrived
at the coaching inn

194
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:25,120
at St Martin Le Grand,
and I knew my way around.

195
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,477
From the maps in my head.

196
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:30,519
But London...the whole thing is
so much bigger than I imagined.

197
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:34,038
And you didn't tell me
how big it was, did ya?

198
00:12:34,038 --> 00:12:37,317
And I didn't know who to turn to,
with no money. So, I came home!

199
00:12:37,317 --> 00:12:39,879
Well, er... Witnesses.

200
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:42,238
Surely someone must have seen
what happened.

201
00:12:42,238 --> 00:12:43,437
There were no witnesses.

202
00:12:43,437 --> 00:12:45,879
Everyone just turned around
and went about their business!

203
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,477
So all 30 shillings?

204
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:50,399
Gone? YES!

205
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,759
Oh!

206
00:12:55,798 --> 00:12:59,197
Then, when Aunt Branwell went to bed
and Papa went back to his study,

207
00:12:59,197 --> 00:13:00,759
I said to him, "You're lying."

208
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,000
And he admitted it.

209
00:13:03,038 --> 00:13:04,597
He didn't even make it to London,

210
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:07,317
never mind any business
at any Royal Academy.

211
00:13:08,597 --> 00:13:11,077
He said he was about to get on
the high-flier, in Bradford,

212
00:13:11,077 --> 00:13:13,197
with his paintings and his sketches.

213
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,278
But then, when he was faced with the
reality of setting off for London,

214
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:21,399
he realised that they just...
weren't that good.

215
00:13:23,158 --> 00:13:25,238
They might look well enough at home,

216
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,798
but next to a Lawrence,
or a Gainsborough...

217
00:13:27,798 --> 00:13:30,837
So he fortified himself, he said,

218
00:13:30,837 --> 00:13:33,879
to get courage to get on the next
coach, which was his intention.

219
00:13:36,918 --> 00:13:38,197
But he didn't.

220
00:13:40,477 --> 00:13:41,837
He spent four days in Bradford.

221
00:13:41,837 --> 00:13:43,918
Drunk and miserable
and dreaming up some trash

222
00:13:43,918 --> 00:13:46,759
that he thought everyone at home
would be blown enough to believe.

223
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,437
He spent 30 shillings on drink,
in four days?

224
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:52,639
I could've cheerfully murdered him,
to start with. And then...

225
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,837
Actually I felt sorry for him.

226
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:01,759
They always expected so much of him.

227
00:14:02,837 --> 00:14:06,120
More, probably,
than he was ever capable of.

228
00:14:07,957 --> 00:14:11,120
And I just thought,
"Thank God I'm not you."

229
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,759
It's disappointing, I know.

230
00:14:19,197 --> 00:14:22,759
And I'm angry with him too.
He humiliated me at Thorp Green,

231
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,399
and he knew what he was doing.

232
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:27,557
But we shouldn't give up on him,
should we?

233
00:14:27,557 --> 00:14:32,437
No, we shouldn't give up on him. But
we should see him for what he is.

234
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:35,639
Not what he isn't.
It's not fair on him.

235
00:14:40,038 --> 00:14:44,557
I sometimes think
Charlotte despises him. Mm, well...

236
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:47,717
Charlotte has her own demons.

237
00:14:49,437 --> 00:14:50,597
What demons?

238
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,077
Look, you know how low she's been?
For months.

239
00:14:57,077 --> 00:14:58,879
To the point of making herself ill,

240
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,000
and convincing herself
she's going blind.

241
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yes? Well, you know
when we were in Brussels?

242
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,879
Monsieur Heger? Yes.

243
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,918
Well...she was very...

244
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:15,077
taken...with him.

245
00:15:16,317 --> 00:15:18,597
Not when I was there.
This was after Aunt Branwell died,

246
00:15:18,597 --> 00:15:19,957
when I stayed at home.

247
00:15:19,957 --> 00:15:21,639
She became...

248
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,158
..obsessed with him.

249
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,238
He was married.

250
00:15:28,837 --> 00:15:31,000
That's why she left. At finish.

251
00:15:51,597 --> 00:15:53,357
"My dear Leyland,

252
00:15:53,357 --> 00:15:55,120
"I returned yesterday

253
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,639
"from a week's journey
to Liverpool and North Wales,

254
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,678
"but I found, during my absence,

255
00:16:00,678 --> 00:16:04,357
"that wherever I went,
a certain woman, robed in black

256
00:16:04,357 --> 00:16:07,798
"and calling herself Misery,
walked by my side,

257
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:09,879
"and leant on my arm
as affectionately

258
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:12,120
"as if she were my legal wife.

259
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,879
"Like some other husbands,
I could have spared her presence."

260
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,717
For the food
we are about to receive,

261
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:33,678
may the Lord make us
truly thankful. Amen.

262
00:16:39,357 --> 00:16:41,798
Is she feeding those dogs again? No.

263
00:16:41,798 --> 00:16:43,759
Chicken, please.

264
00:16:45,477 --> 00:16:47,120
More tea.

265
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,837
Branwell...

266
00:16:48,837 --> 00:16:53,837
Yeah? Tell us something
about...Liverpool.

267
00:16:53,837 --> 00:16:57,120
All right. Well,
the docks were extraordinary.

268
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,599
Uh-huh? We saw a black man.
A blackamoor, a Creole.

269
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:05,798
He really was black. So dark, Papa.

270
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:07,558
Ah? And I spoke to him.

271
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:10,079
Didn't really understand
what he was saying

272
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,278
and I don't think he understood
a word I was saying either

273
00:17:13,278 --> 00:17:15,359
but it was just...fascinating.

274
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,640
I think he was something
on one of the ships.

275
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:27,599
MUFFLED LAUGHTER

276
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:39,119
CHUCKLING

277
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,798
Yes?

278
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,999
If you...

279
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:03,719
If you don't...

280
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:05,920
get on top of...

281
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,319
of this habit...

282
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,278
when things don't go right for you,

283
00:18:10,278 --> 00:18:13,199
if you can't exercise
some restraint,

284
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:16,119
then it'll take over your life,
Branwell. Don't be ridiculous.

285
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,640
I'm not being ridiculous.

286
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,559
It'll destroy you. Mm.

287
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,798
Potentially, you still have
so much to offer, Branwell.

288
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:28,999
You need a plan.
I've got plans. Have you?

289
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,599
And can you share them? With anyone?

290
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,839
D'you know what I've realised? What?

291
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:40,400
There's no money in poetry.

292
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,479
Novels.
That's where the money is.

293
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,759
Whilst the composition of a poem

294
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:54,439
demands the utmost stretch
of a man's intellect...

295
00:18:56,278 --> 00:18:59,319
..and for what?
ã10 at best.

296
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,038
I could hum a tune
and smoke a cigar

297
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:07,759
and I'd have a novel written.

298
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:10,278
No-one will publish a novel
by an unknown author.

299
00:19:10,278 --> 00:19:13,400
I've had nine poems published
in the Halifax Guardian.

300
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,920
It's only Halifax, I know,
but it is widely enough read.

301
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:22,079
You'd need a good story for a novel.

302
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,640
Oh, when was I ever
short of a story?

303
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:35,798
Are you still thinking about going
to Paris? I don't think it's likely.

304
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,199
At the moment.
Why? It might do you good.

305
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:45,839
Are you still hell-bent
on making yourself poorly?

306
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:48,999
I'm not...poorly.

307
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,359
I'm just struggling to...

308
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:04,038
Why is it that a woman's lot
is so very different to a man's?

309
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:08,759
I've never felt inferior.
Have you? Intellectually?

310
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,719
Why is it that we have
so very few opportunities?

311
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:17,439
You or I could do almost anything
we set our minds to. But no.

312
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:20,239
All we can realistically plan
is a school, a modest enough school,

313
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:21,640
that no-one wants to come to.

314
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,719
Why is it that the woman's lot
is to be perpetually infantilised...

315
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,400
..or else invisible and powerless
to do anything about it?

316
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,798
Did he never write back
to you, then?

317
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,880
Heger?

318
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:51,519
No.

319
00:21:58,199 --> 00:22:00,880
Anne says
you've written some poems.

320
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,119
Have you ever thought about
publishing them? No.

321
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,119
It's just the...

322
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,400
The thing is, you see...
I've written some verses too...

323
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,920
and if between us we could
accumulate enough material

324
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,999
to think about publishing
a small volume...

325
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:34,359
And have it pored over
and rubbished and ridiculed

326
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:38,079
by anyone who might choose to waste
their money on it? Not likely.

327
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:43,239
"He comes with Western winds,
with evening's wandering airs,

328
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:46,880
"With that clear dusk of heaven
that brings the thickest stars.

329
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,479
"Winds take a pensive tone,
and stars a tender fire,

330
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:55,079
"And visions rise, and change,
that kill me with desire."

331
00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:02,239
"High waving heather
'neath stormy blasts bending,

332
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:05,319
"Midnight and moonlight
and bright shining stars;

333
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:08,160
"Darkness and glory
rejoicingly blending,

334
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,920
"Earth rising to heaven
and heaven descending,

335
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,119
"Man's spirit away from
its drear dungeon sending,

336
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:16,719
"Bursting the fetters
and breaking the bars."

337
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,079
"Then dawns the Invisible;
the Unseen its truth reveals;

338
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:26,880
"My outward sense is gone,
my inward essence feels;

339
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,880
"Its wings are almost free -
its home, its harbour found,

340
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,559
"Measuring the gulf, it stoops
and dares the final bound."

341
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,719
"O dreadful is the check -
intense the agony -

342
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:41,599
"When the ear begins to hear,
and the eye begins to see;

343
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:44,759
"When the pulse begins to throb -
the brain to think again -

344
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:47,439
"The soul to feel the flesh,
and the flesh to feel the chain.

345
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:52,999
"Yet I would lose no sting,
would wish no torture less;

346
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:56,920
"The more that anguish racks
the earlier it will bless;

347
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:01,319
"And robed in fires of hell,
or bright with heavenly shine,

348
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:05,519
"If it but herald Death,
the vision is divine."

349
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,719
BANGING

350
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:44,559
FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS

351
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:52,199
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

352
00:26:52,199 --> 00:26:53,880
Somebody has been in my room!

353
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,079
Somebody?
Somebody has been through my things.

354
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,920
And not had the wit,
when they put them back,

355
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,519
to realise that everything was
in a certain order Well, who?

356
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,239
We haven't, I haven't.
You haven't.

357
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:03,880
You wouldn't. I know that.

358
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,959
Branwell's in Halifax.

359
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:06,759
It's safe to assume
Papa couldn't see to do it,

360
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:08,319
and anyway why would he bother?

361
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:11,278
Tabby's got better things to do
and Martha can't read that well.

362
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:13,160
Yet, she also has too much dignity

363
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,400
and respect
for other people's things!

364
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,079
I shouldn't have...I know.

365
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,798
But I'm not sorry.
I mean, I am sorry!

366
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:24,479
Look, Emily.

367
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:27,038
Your poems are...

368
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:28,798
They're extraordinary.

369
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:31,199
I know they're private,
I know they're personal -

370
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:33,839
they're 1,001 things, but they're
not something to keep hidden.

371
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,359
I admit it was curiosity,
but not idle curiosity, I hope,

372
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:41,439
but something more...noble. Noble?!

373
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:44,519
Going in people's bedrooms?
Going through people's things?

374
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:47,798
No woman, no-one, has ever
written poetry like this!

375
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:50,479
Nothing I've read,
nothing I can think of,

376
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:52,999
nothing published, is its equal.

377
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:55,479
Emily...they're exceptional.

378
00:27:55,479 --> 00:27:56,959
They're...astonishing.

379
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:59,160
I couldn't breathe
when I was reading them.

380
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,719
I know you're angry and
I know what I did is unforgivable.

381
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:06,439
Except, please, see that it isn't.

382
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:11,439
You...disgust me.

383
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,719
You can't begin to imagine how much.

384
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:17,599
You stay out of my room
and you don't speak to me.

385
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:20,759
You don't speak to me generally and
you don't speak to me specifically

386
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:24,519
about your misguided, tedious,
grubby little publishing plans.

387
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:28,199
What on earth is the matter?

388
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:31,599
She has been in people's bedrooms
going through people's things!

389
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:33,400
I'm putting a lock on that door!

390
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,839
She? What happened?

391
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,319
Charlotte? Nothing.

392
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,999
It was nothing.
I went in her bedroom.

393
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:45,759
Oh!
HE SIGHS

394
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,439
And, um, where is Branwell?

395
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:53,359
Halifax. He's where? Halifax.

396
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,119
Oh. And is he due in? Tonight?

397
00:28:57,439 --> 00:29:01,559
Or have we to lock the back door?
I imagine he's taken a key.

398
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:02,959
Right.

399
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:25,319
All right! I made a mistake.

400
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,680
Except I didn't!

401
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,119
They're...

402
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:34,798
Have you read them?

403
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:36,079
No.

404
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,079
She's never asked me to.

405
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:46,559
What did she mean about your
"grubby little publishing plans?"

406
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:12,798
They're not without charm.

407
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:20,160
It's not just the poems, you see.

408
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,359
I'm writing this, too.

409
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,798
It's a novel.

410
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:27,319
It's not Gondal and Gaaldine.

411
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:30,239
It's more about how things are
in the real world.

412
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:33,599
It's about being a governess,
it's all...

413
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,199
things I've seen and heard
and witnessed.

414
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,920
The thing is, you see, I...
This is beautifully written.

415
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:46,519
I would be ready.

416
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:49,400
To try and publish.
I would be ready to risk failure.

417
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,640
And who knows? This is what
we've done all our lives.

418
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,199
Write. We've lived in our heads.

419
00:30:56,719 --> 00:30:59,278
I don't regard the attempt
to do something with it as venal.

420
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:01,599
It's more venal selling ourselves
as governesses

421
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,439
when we find it such a trial.

422
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:06,880
So long as we approached
it carefully, wisely,

423
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,599
and not make fools of ourselves,
then surely... The plan...

424
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:14,400
would be to try to publish
a volume of poetry first.

425
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,559
And, then, if that met with
a modicum of success,

426
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,759
and something of a name
was established,

427
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:23,079
then we could each risk
a work of fiction.

428
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:28,400
I've toyed with writing
something about...Brussels.

429
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,439
I mean, I don't even know
if that's the etiquette.

430
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:36,719
But I could write to
a publishing house and find out.

431
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,038
Your poems are competent...

432
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:44,519
and charming.

433
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:46,479
And I'm no great poet myself,

434
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:50,559
but Emily's contribution could
elevate a small volume

435
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,999
into something...

436
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:56,079
..actually worth spending
a few shillings on.

437
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,680
I feel sorry for her. Why?

438
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:08,920
Same reason I feel sorry
for Branwell.

439
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,759
So much is expected of her.
Being the eldest.

440
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:14,439
And not even the eldest.
By accident the eldest.

441
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:17,439
Bossiest. She was bossy when Maria
and Elizabeth were still alive,

442
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:19,278
I remember it. Vividly.

443
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:23,400
It's being so bossy
that's stunted her growth.

444
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,920
She's ambitious.

445
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,759
For all of us.

446
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:28,880
And I can see
nothing wrong with that.

447
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:34,400
I realise some people might think
it's vulgar, but, Emily,

448
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,880
we were born writing, and if we're
cautious, if we're clever,

449
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,880
and we are, and if we disguise
our real selves and our sex...

450
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,719
Right, that's done.

451
00:32:43,719 --> 00:32:46,119
Tabby! I'm off down the...hill.

452
00:32:48,278 --> 00:32:52,119
It's wonderful how quiet they all
think she is in t'village

453
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:53,920
and how loud she is at home.

454
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:57,160
You can come with me, if you want.

455
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,719
Have you ever thought about writing
something that's not Gondal?

456
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:07,959
Something more...not princesses
and emperors, more just...

457
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:09,759
what happens in the real world.

458
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:15,160
You know when I worked in Halifax?
At that school at Law Hill.

459
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,400
Yes. Miss Patchett, that ran it,
she told me this tale.

460
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,160
And I've often thought
it'd make a story. A novel.

461
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,319
What was it about?

462
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:25,439
This man, this lad. Jack Sharp.
Have I never told you this?

463
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:28,640
It serves us well enough, but it's
not an attractive building, I know.

464
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,559
It has a rather curious history.

465
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,719
It was built out of spite,
apparently, 60 years ago,

466
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:35,439
by a man called Jack Sharp.

467
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:37,400
So, there's this family,
the Walkers.

468
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,038
They own Walterclough Hall,
this big house, just above Halifax,

469
00:33:40,038 --> 00:33:41,759
it's been in the family
for generations.

470
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:43,999
They're woollen manufacturers -
aren't they all?

471
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:47,119
Anyway, John Walker has four
children - two boys and two girls -

472
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:49,239
and he's adopted this nephew,
Jack Sharp.

473
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,559
Richard and John, the two sons,
were educated well,

474
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,880
and they ended up
making their livings in London.

475
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,278
Jack stayed at home with the girls,
Grace and Mary,

476
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:01,839
and he was trained up
to take over the family business

477
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:04,919
which suited everyone, because,
it seems, he'd always been

478
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:07,317
old Mr Walker's favourite,
the truth be told.

479
00:34:07,317 --> 00:34:09,398
Then when Richard,
the eldest son, dies

480
00:34:09,398 --> 00:34:11,000
in some tragic accident somewhere,

481
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,960
old Mr Walker decides to leave
the district and he leaves Jack

482
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,358
in charge of his business
and Walterclough Hall.

483
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:19,797
Eventually, some years later,
old Mr Walker himself dies,

484
00:34:19,797 --> 00:34:21,559
and the remaining son, John,

485
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,398
in London, inherits everything
and gives Jack Sharp,

486
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:28,119
who he'd never liked, notice
to vacate the property forthwith.

487
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:30,480
But John Walker Jr
has the law on his side,

488
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,239
and after enough wrangling,
in court, Jack Sharp has to

489
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,679
vacate the property,
whether he likes it or not.

490
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,239
But not before he'd trashed the
place and taken anything of value.

491
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,277
Furniture...

492
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:42,239
..the silver, the plate, the linen.

493
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,960
You can only imagine
what they all went through.

494
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,000
The anger and the bitterness.

495
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,878
And then he built his own home,
a new house.

496
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:51,277
Here, at Law Hill.

497
00:34:51,277 --> 00:34:53,719
The spot chosen very carefully,
people believed,

498
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,039
because it looks down
on Walterclough Hall.

499
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:58,960
And then he filled it with the stash
he'd purloined from the Hall.

500
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,838
Like he was goading John Walker
to come and fetch it. If he dared.

501
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:06,000
And did he dare? I doubt it.
But the worst thing Jack Sharp did,

502
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,797
one of old Mr Walker's sisters
had a son,

503
00:35:07,797 --> 00:35:09,398
grown up by then, called Sam Stead.

504
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,440
And Jack Sharp apprenticed him
in the trade,

505
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,358
like he himself had been apprenticed
by old Mr Walker.

506
00:35:14,358 --> 00:35:17,480
And he cleverly,
calculatedly, bit by bit,

507
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,559
indulged and degraded Sam Stead
with gambling and drink,

508
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:22,918
and the lad was too feckless
to know any better.

509
00:35:22,918 --> 00:35:24,119
Why would you do that?

510
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:26,358
He did it to cause as much misery
and humiliation

511
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:27,639
to the Walkers as he could.

512
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:32,440
That's... I know. All that anger.
It's so...rich.

513
00:35:34,838 --> 00:35:38,679
Anyway, if we're writing novels.
I imagine we'll need more paper.

514
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,518
BELLS PEAL

515
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,518
Of course we're not going to
use our real names!

516
00:35:47,518 --> 00:35:49,000
But must they be men's names?

517
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,960
When a man writes something, it's
what he's written that's judged.

518
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,398
When a woman writes something,
it's her that's judged.

519
00:35:54,398 --> 00:35:57,759
We must select the poems
we want to use and then...

520
00:35:57,759 --> 00:36:01,518
yes, if we're to be taken seriously
and judged fairly

521
00:36:01,518 --> 00:36:03,797
and make anything resembling
a profit...

522
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:06,639
..we must walk invisible.

523
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,277
What about names that are
neither men's nor women's?

524
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:05,838
"Dear Ellen. I reached home
a little after 2 o'clock

525
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:07,719
"all safe and right yesterday.

526
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:10,358
"Emily and Anne were gone
to Keighley to meet me.

527
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:12,878
"Unfortunately,
I had returned by the old road

528
00:37:12,878 --> 00:37:16,239
"while they were gone by the new,
and we missed each other."

529
00:37:30,318 --> 00:37:31,759
KNOCK ON DOOR

530
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:33,079
I'm back home.

531
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,440
Ah, Charlotte...

532
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,358
Miss Bronte!

533
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,119
Mr Nicholls.

534
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:54,960
"I went into the room where
Branwell was, to speak to him.

535
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,239
"It was very forced work
to address him.

536
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:00,159
"I might have spared myself
the trouble as he took no notice..."

537
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:01,440
Branwell?

538
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,797
"..and made no reply."

539
00:38:02,797 --> 00:38:04,318
Branwell.

540
00:38:04,318 --> 00:38:06,518
"He was stupefied."

541
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,239
What's this?

542
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:17,159
Branwell? What's this?

543
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:18,480
That's for you.

544
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,599
I opened it by mistake.
It said "Esquire."

545
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:24,039
Give me that.

546
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:26,159
Proof pages!

547
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:29,797
How much are you paying them for
the privilege of being published?

548
00:38:29,797 --> 00:38:32,039
I assume you're paying them.

549
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:35,159
I assume you've all
clubbed together.

550
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:37,559
I assume they're not paying you.

551
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:39,398
You've been sick.

552
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,039
I didn't confirm or deny,
I made no reply.

553
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:50,197
I don't care about him knowing
we're paying them,

554
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:52,119
it's a means to an end
as far as I'm concerned.

555
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:53,518
I care about him talking to people.

556
00:38:53,518 --> 00:38:56,277
About us. Where's he got the money
from anyway? To get into that state?

557
00:38:56,277 --> 00:38:58,918
He screwed a sovereign out of Papa,
yesterday. He claimed to have

558
00:38:58,918 --> 00:39:01,518
some pressing matter, and Papa said
no. And the next thing you know

559
00:39:01,518 --> 00:39:03,918
he's given it to him. God knows how
or why and he's trotting off

560
00:39:03,918 --> 00:39:05,878
down the hill to get it changed
at the Black Bull.

561
00:39:05,878 --> 00:39:08,318
Perhaps, when he's sober,
he'll not even remember he's seen

562
00:39:08,318 --> 00:39:10,838
our proof sheets. I'll write to
Aylott and Jones and ask them

563
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:13,197
to address our correspondence
differently in future.

564
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:17,039
Was he angry, Branwell?
What can we do?

565
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:19,559
We can't include him, the way
he is now! He's unmanageable!

566
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:21,518
We'd never get anything
agreed or done!

567
00:39:21,518 --> 00:39:24,639
Anyway, why would Northangerland
want to publish with his sisters?

568
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:27,000
He certainly couldn't afford
to contribute to the costs.

569
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,440
We're doing the right thing, Anne.

570
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,797
It's hard, it's tough,

571
00:39:30,797 --> 00:39:33,639
but I'm sorry, he'd drag us down
with him if we let him.

572
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:37,679
Right, come on, you big oaf.

573
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:40,559
That way. Shift.

574
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:23,039
TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS

575
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:25,797
HAMMERING

576
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,039
Hello, Joe.

577
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,518
Well, I never.

578
00:40:41,518 --> 00:40:42,559
Eh?

579
00:40:59,398 --> 00:41:04,878
How y'doing, lad? I've resolved
this morning to keep myself busy.

580
00:41:04,878 --> 00:41:06,119
Good.

581
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:09,639
Good!

582
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:10,918
Me too.

583
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,559
I thought I'd go and see
John Frobisher.

584
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:18,797
I thought I might write
something to set to music.

585
00:41:18,797 --> 00:41:22,119
And he'd be the man.
He is still here, isn't he?

586
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:24,159
At the church?
So far as I know, yeah.

587
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:26,518
Have y'not thought any more
about going abroad?

588
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:29,159
Not... No...

589
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,277
I haven't seen any vacancies,

590
00:41:32,277 --> 00:41:35,440
at least nothing, you know...

591
00:41:36,797 --> 00:41:39,440
Not with the way things are
at the moment.

592
00:41:41,197 --> 00:41:43,159
How are things at home?

593
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:49,079
It's like living with people

594
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:51,039
who don't speak
the same language as I do.

595
00:41:52,398 --> 00:41:54,719
Honestly, Joe.
I could be with some tribe

596
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:56,878
from some far flung corner
of the globe

597
00:41:56,878 --> 00:41:58,679
for all I have in common with them.

598
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:00,559
They despise me,

599
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:01,719
and I...

600
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:06,277
I only live there because
I'm such a fucking pauper.

601
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:10,239
They need to get married,
those three.

602
00:42:11,398 --> 00:42:12,960
Only, who'd have 'em?

603
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:17,277
Who'd have any of us?

604
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:20,480
What a ridiculous set we've become.

605
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,318
And we used to be
quite a nice little family.

606
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:41,838
She...she does love me, you know,
Joe, Lydia.

607
00:42:44,358 --> 00:42:47,679
Yeah. Well...
You know, I don't know.

608
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:51,759
I wasn't there, I can't say.

609
00:42:53,878 --> 00:42:55,797
I know everyone thinks I'm...

610
00:42:56,878 --> 00:42:59,639
God knows, but if you saw her,

611
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:03,197
if only for a moment,
you'd get it, you'd see.

612
00:43:03,197 --> 00:43:05,079
What would I see?

613
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:08,759
That she's the kind of woman
that can change a man's life.

614
00:43:08,759 --> 00:43:10,559
His whole...everything.

615
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:13,197
You've got to look forward,
though, eh? Not back.

616
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:15,918
We've talked about this.

617
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:22,197
Am I boring you, Leyland?

618
00:43:22,197 --> 00:43:24,197
No, lad. No. You're not boring me.

619
00:43:28,918 --> 00:43:30,960
I worry that you're kidding yerself.

620
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,358
Eh?

621
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:35,197
A woman her age, in her position.

622
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:44,239
My only hope is that he'll be dead
soon and I'll be asked back.

623
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:00,239
Hello.

624
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:07,878
Hello.

625
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:15,398
Look.

626
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,679
I know.

627
00:44:34,358 --> 00:44:36,440
Ahh, it's beautiful!

628
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,559
The same moon that's shone down
since we were children.

629
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Since our ancestors were children.

630
00:44:44,277 --> 00:44:45,719
We're so tiny, really.

631
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,159
Aren't we? So...

632
00:44:50,197 --> 00:44:51,518
..so unimportant.

633
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,440
All of us.

634
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,119
That's right.

635
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:02,039
DOGS BARK IN THE DISTANCE

636
00:45:05,318 --> 00:45:06,797
Bloody dogs.

637
00:45:08,759 --> 00:45:10,918
HE HOWLS

638
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:14,277
SHE JOINS HIM

639
00:45:14,277 --> 00:45:18,398
A CACOPHONY OF HOWLING

640
00:45:19,797 --> 00:45:21,878
HE LAUGHS

641
00:45:21,878 --> 00:45:24,079
THEY CONTINUE HOWLING

642
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:05,039
There's a fella in Black Bull
lookin' for thee. Who?

643
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:07,639
He says he's from Thorp Green.

644
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,518
Who?

645
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:15,480
I'll get my coat.

646
00:46:26,358 --> 00:46:28,197
Shift!

647
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,480
Is there a fella looking for me?
Aye, he's through there.

648
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:44,838
Mr Bronte.

649
00:46:46,759 --> 00:46:49,838
Someone's dead. Mr Robinson.

650
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,599
He passed away three weeks
this last Tuesday.

651
00:46:55,639 --> 00:46:56,759
Did you not know?

652
00:46:57,797 --> 00:47:00,119
No. How could I?

653
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:02,719
Well, it's been in t'papers.

654
00:47:03,797 --> 00:47:05,518
We don't get the York papers.

655
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,918
You're advised...

656
00:47:29,318 --> 00:47:30,918
..to stay away.

657
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:42,079
Does she not...want me
to go to her?

658
00:47:44,878 --> 00:47:46,239
She didn't say that.

659
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:47,679
No, it isn't her.

660
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,918
It's Mr Evans.

661
00:47:50,918 --> 00:47:53,559
One of the trustees
of Mr Robinson's will.

662
00:47:55,318 --> 00:47:58,960
Apparently...he's said
if he sees you, he'll shoot you.

663
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:02,398
Did he send you?

664
00:48:02,398 --> 00:48:04,119
No. No.

665
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:05,719
She did.

666
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:09,759
She was concerned you might turn up.

667
00:48:09,759 --> 00:48:13,277
And that Mr Evans might feel
obliged to do as he's threatened.

668
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:18,878
But, as well as that,
you should know

669
00:48:18,878 --> 00:48:20,518
by the terms of the will...

670
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:24,599
..that if she marries again,

671
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:27,878
she'll forfeit any right
to her husband's fortune.

672
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,759
What?

673
00:48:30,759 --> 00:48:32,079
Every penny.

674
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:35,480
And the house.

675
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:41,119
She...

676
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,119
She asked me not to tell you
how wretched she is.

677
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:56,719
You'd not recognise her, Mr Bronte.

678
00:48:58,197 --> 00:49:01,518
She's worn herself out these past
few months in attendance upon him.

679
00:49:01,518 --> 00:49:04,000
And then, the last few days
before his death,

680
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,639
his manner was so mild, so, er...

681
00:49:08,759 --> 00:49:10,197
..conciliatory.

682
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:15,358
It's a pity to see her,
kneeling at her prayers.

683
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,719
In tears.

684
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:20,878
I suppose we can only guess at

685
00:49:20,878 --> 00:49:23,918
what torments of conscience
she might be going through...

686
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,759
..now.

687
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:35,197
But...she sent you.

688
00:49:35,197 --> 00:49:36,518
Hm.

689
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,000
To beg you to think of
your own safety, Mr Bronte.

690
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:45,878
And her sanity.

691
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:48,639
Which...

692
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:50,797
below stairs,

693
00:49:50,797 --> 00:49:53,878
we fear hangs by a thread.

694
00:49:56,197 --> 00:49:58,719
I don't give a damn
about my own safety.

695
00:50:00,759 --> 00:50:01,838
No.

696
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:05,119
But the thing is...

697
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:11,918
..it's never going to happen,
Mr Bronte.

698
00:50:14,398 --> 00:50:16,159
Do you understand?

699
00:50:22,878 --> 00:50:24,679
You're advised to stay away.

700
00:50:50,878 --> 00:50:53,639
Mr Brown! Mr Brown!

701
00:50:54,679 --> 00:50:57,000
Mr Brown! What do you want,
you little bugger?

702
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,878
You've to come! Mr Thomas at
Black Bull says you've to come!

703
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:08,679
Now what? God knows.

704
00:51:08,679 --> 00:51:10,639
There were a fella here.

705
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:13,277
Paddy? Come on, lad. What's up?
I sent for thee.

706
00:51:13,277 --> 00:51:16,000
Look at state he's in...
No, you've done right.

707
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,197
Come on, lad.

708
00:51:17,197 --> 00:51:19,159
BRANWELL WEEPS

709
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:21,398
Come on, you're all right.

710
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:24,197
Nothing I do, John.

711
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,197
You're just tired. Nothing I do.

712
00:51:28,197 --> 00:51:30,759
Let's get you home. Come on.

713
00:51:34,518 --> 00:51:37,440
Why are we going up here?
It's where you live.

714
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,039
I don't want to go home,
I don't want to go home.

715
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:43,559
Well, where d'you want to go, then?

716
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:44,960
Keighley.

717
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,759
I think meself
you'd be better off at home.

718
00:51:47,759 --> 00:51:50,440
No, no! I need to go to
Thorp Green, John.

719
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,918
I need to go to Thorp Green.

720
00:51:51,918 --> 00:51:55,559
Fair enough, but not just now,
not today, not in this state.

721
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:58,838
Yes, in this state.
This is the right state.

722
00:51:58,838 --> 00:52:01,878
Well, you can. I can't, obviously,

723
00:52:01,878 --> 00:52:05,197
it's two o'clock in the afternoon,
I've to get to work.

724
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:08,159
Ah, Mr Nicholls.

725
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:11,719
He's... He's had a bad do,

726
00:52:11,719 --> 00:52:13,679
he's had a bit of bad news.

727
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:19,159
Down you go.

728
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:23,559
Nearly there.

729
00:52:30,838 --> 00:52:32,440
Careful. Nearly there.

730
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,599
BRANWELL SOBS

731
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:37,719
Calm down. Get off me!
Please, keep your voice down.

732
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:39,960
Shut up, I hate you!

733
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,599
Tell me to calm down
in my own house!

734
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:43,918
I want to kill you!

735
00:52:43,918 --> 00:52:47,559
Get your hands off me! Calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down.

736
00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:49,878
I don't want you
to tell me anything.

737
00:52:50,797 --> 00:52:52,159
My house!

738
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:53,759
Nothing wrong with me.

739
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,440
Look at them, all looking at me!

740
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,480
They're always looking at me!

741
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,119
With your stupid, empty faces!

742
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:10,759
Please, stop looking at me!

743
00:53:10,759 --> 00:53:11,918
Just stop.

744
00:53:16,759 --> 00:53:18,277
And him!

745
00:53:22,197 --> 00:53:23,878
What do you want, eh?

746
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:27,119
You've had everything!

747
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,599
You've had everything
you're getting.

748
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:33,440
You just stand there
staring at me all the time!

749
00:53:35,398 --> 00:53:37,159
I hate you!

750
00:53:38,797 --> 00:53:42,277
BRANWELL WEEPS
AND MUMBLES INCOHERENTLY

751
00:53:48,398 --> 00:53:50,239
Come on upstairs, have a lie down.

752
00:53:52,358 --> 00:53:54,039
Have a few knock-out drops, eh?

753
00:53:55,159 --> 00:53:57,559
Eh? Come on.

754
00:53:57,559 --> 00:53:59,599
Ohh...I feel sick.

755
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,398
Come on.

756
00:54:01,398 --> 00:54:04,878
Up we go. You heard him. Lift me up.

757
00:54:04,878 --> 00:54:06,838
I can do it!

758
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:22,277
Sorry. Sorry.

759
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,878
"Dear Ellen.

760
00:54:35,878 --> 00:54:38,797
"We have been somewhat
more harassed than usual lately.

761
00:54:38,797 --> 00:54:41,960
"The death of Mr Robinson has served
Branwell for a pretext

762
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,797
"to throw all about him
into hubbub and confusion.

763
00:54:44,797 --> 00:54:47,159
"He's become intolerable.

764
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:49,797
"To Papa he allows rest
neither day nor night and

765
00:54:49,797 --> 00:54:53,277
"he's continually screwing money
out of him, sometimes threatening

766
00:54:53,277 --> 00:54:56,079
"that he'll kill himself
if it's withheld from him."

BELL RINGS

768
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:05,398
BRANWELL AND FATHER ARGUE IN ROOM

769
00:55:05,398 --> 00:55:08,239
Morning, Miss Bronte. Thank you.

770
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:10,277
BRANWELL: Are you stupid
as well as blind?

771
00:55:10,277 --> 00:55:11,878
There's nothing out there!

772
00:55:11,878 --> 00:55:14,518
Not for someone
who's fit for nothing, like me!

773
00:55:14,518 --> 00:55:18,599
"He says Mrs Robinson is now insane,
that her mind is a complete wreck,

774
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:21,679
"owing to remorse for her conduct
towards Mr Robinson,

775
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:24,277
"whose end it appears was hastened
by distress of mind,

776
00:55:24,277 --> 00:55:26,277
"and grief for having lost him.

777
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,719
"I do not know how much to believe
of what he says.

778
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:34,079
"He now declares that he neither can
nor will do anything for himself.

779
00:55:35,719 --> 00:55:38,119
"Good situations have been offered
more than once,

780
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:41,197
"for which by a fortnight's work
he might have qualified himself,

781
00:55:41,197 --> 00:55:44,277
"but he will do nothing except
drink and make us all wretched."

782
00:55:44,277 --> 00:55:46,079
BRANWELL: Just tell me where it is!

783
00:55:48,039 --> 00:55:51,719
BRANWELL AND FATHER CONTINUE ARGUING

784
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:54,797
I beg you to recognise it -
you are ill!

785
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:05,398
Two reviews. One from The Critic
one from The Athenaeum.

786
00:56:05,398 --> 00:56:09,358
Both anonymous,
but both really, really quite good.

787
00:56:09,358 --> 00:56:10,838
Especially about you.

788
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:15,559
"Refreshing, vigorous poetry,
no sickly affectations,

789
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:19,159
"no namby-pamby, no tedious
imitations of familiar strains."

790
00:56:23,239 --> 00:56:24,960
Are they still fighting?

791
00:56:29,838 --> 00:56:32,197
Are you going to be all right?

792
00:56:32,197 --> 00:56:34,679
When I go to Manchester with Papa?

793
00:56:34,679 --> 00:56:38,239
It's only three weeks. I'm more
concerned about when he comes back.

794
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:39,759
He'll need rest and quiet.
Not...

795
00:56:39,759 --> 00:56:42,197
Oh, did you get what you wanted?

796
00:56:42,197 --> 00:56:44,599
Yeah, you!
Are you proud of yourself, eh?

797
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:47,599
Wangling money out of a blind man?
A man practically in his 70s.

798
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:51,918
Fuck off. Eh! Come back here and say
that. Yeah, go on. Have a go.

799
00:56:51,918 --> 00:56:53,639
See what happens. I haven't time.

800
00:56:53,639 --> 00:56:56,159
No? Just the blind and the elderly
then, is it?

801
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:57,838
Otherwise I would.

802
00:56:57,838 --> 00:56:59,759
Course you would!

803
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:30,918
It's nothing.

804
00:57:30,918 --> 00:57:32,197
Did he just hit you?

805
00:57:34,679 --> 00:57:36,039
Don't make a fuss.

806
00:57:48,277 --> 00:57:51,277
I'm still aiming to finish my story
by the end of this week.

807
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,119
There's a handful of passages
I'd like to look at again,

808
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:58,039
but then, depending on where
you and Anne are with yours...

809
00:57:58,039 --> 00:58:01,559
Oh, The Professor's finished.
As much as it ever will be.

810
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,000
Perhaps we could aim to get them off
to a publisher

811
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,878
before you set off for Manchester.

812
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:31,960
Emily.

813
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,440
Good luck.

814
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,159
And you.

815
00:58:35,159 --> 00:58:36,878
Keep him wrapped up, see.

816
00:58:36,878 --> 00:58:39,440
All the bags on?
Everything's under control, Papa.

817
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,518
Has she heard? Yes! I've heard.
Emily, Emily.

818
00:58:42,518 --> 00:58:44,599
You know where the gun is?

819
00:58:44,599 --> 00:58:45,918
Yes.

820
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:48,719
We're all in. Thank you.

821
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:52,719
I'll send you the address
as soon as we know what it is.

822
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,480
DRIVER: Walk on!

823
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,440
Branwell doesn't know
where the gun is. Does he?

824
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,079
Not any more.

825
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:11,599
Is he still abed?

826
00:59:12,797 --> 00:59:14,398
Daft question.

827
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:25,480
You give him no money.

828
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,719
Whatever sob stories
he comes up with.

829
00:59:28,838 --> 00:59:29,960
All right?

830
00:59:32,358 --> 00:59:34,079
He won't hit you.

831
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,759
And if he hits me,
I'll hit him back. Harder.

832
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,358
"Dear Ellen. Papa and I came here
on Wednesday.

833

they actually read them?

01:01:09,918 --> 01:01:12,079
Do they look like they've been read?

01:03:27,639 --> 01:03:31,318
..forced to abandon her home.
A good, well-off home,

856
01:03:31,318 --> 01:03:33,518
to protect her child and herself,

857
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:37,639
because of a change in her husband's
character when he sinks into...

858
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:42,318
You know, addictive behaviour.

859
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:45,797
And then forced to make her own way
in the world.

860
01:03:45,797 --> 01:03:48,398
No. I don't think it's wrong.

861
01:03:50,197 --> 01:03:51,918
I'd never have invented Hindley

862
01:03:51,918 --> 01:03:54,559
if I hadn't been set
such a fine example at home.

863
01:04:04,518 --> 01:04:07,119
Have you seen Branwell today?
No.

864
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:10,518
Have you heard him?

865
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:19,838
"I see a corpse
upon the waters lie,

866
01:04:19,838 --> 01:04:24,159
"With eyes turned,
swelled and sightless, to the sky

867
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:28,918
"And arms outstretched,
to move as wave on wave

868
01:04:28,918 --> 01:04:32,318
"Upbears it
in its boundless billowy grave.

869
01:04:33,559 --> 01:04:38,639
"Not time, but Ocean thins
its flowing hair;

870
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:42,599
"Decay, not sorrow,
lays its forehead bare;

871
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:47,159
"Its members move,
but not in thankless toil,

872
01:04:47,159 --> 01:04:50,518
"For seas are milder
than this world's turmoil.

873
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:55,277
"Corruption robs its lip
and cheeks of red,

874
01:04:55,277 --> 01:04:58,440
"But wounded vanity grieves
not the dead;

875
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,358
"And, though those members
hasten to decay,

876
01:05:02,358 --> 01:05:06,239
"No pang of suffering takes
their strength away;

877
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:09,918
"With untormented eye,
and heart, and brain,

878
01:05:09,918 --> 01:05:14,119
"Through calm and storm
it floats across the main.

879
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:19,079
"Though love and joy
have perished long ago,

880
01:05:19,079 --> 01:05:22,797
"Its bosom suffers
not one pang of woe;

881
01:05:22,797 --> 01:05:26,358
"Though weeds and worms
its cherished beauty hide,

882
01:05:26,358 --> 01:05:29,599
"It feels not wounded vanity
or pride."

883
01:05:38,119 --> 01:05:40,079
WIND BLOWS

884
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,518
Where's ye going, lad?

885
01:06:05,518 --> 01:06:06,719
Haworth.

886
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:08,119
HORSE WHINNIES

887
01:06:08,119 --> 01:06:09,918
Whoa. Whoa!

888
01:06:12,918 --> 01:06:14,599
Go on!

889
01:07:07,838 --> 01:07:09,358
Oh, hello.

890
01:07:14,398 --> 01:07:15,918
Branwell!

891
01:07:18,197 --> 01:07:21,398
Branwell's here! He's collapsed!
He's outside!

892
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:27,197
Branwell?

893
01:07:28,197 --> 01:07:29,239
Branwell.

894
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:31,639
Branwell?

895
01:07:33,719 --> 01:07:35,838
One of you go and fetch
Dr Wheelhouse.

896
01:07:35,838 --> 01:07:37,518
Get a cloak on!

897
01:07:37,518 --> 01:07:39,318
Let's get him inside.

898
01:07:39,318 --> 01:07:41,119
Branwell, eh?

899
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:45,000
Come on, son, sit up.

900
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,599
Let's get him in the house. Come on.

901
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:49,797
DOOR OPENS

902
01:07:49,797 --> 01:07:52,440
You know where I am. Yes, yes.

903
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,119
Thank you for coming, Doctor.

904
01:07:56,318 --> 01:07:58,277
DOOR CLOSES

905
01:08:00,797 --> 01:08:02,277
There is hope.

906
01:08:03,759 --> 01:08:05,480
He's home, he's back with us.

907
01:08:06,518 --> 01:08:09,918
And, with nourishment
and abstinence,

908
01:08:09,918 --> 01:08:13,157
and prayer, and peace and quiet,

909
01:08:13,157 --> 01:08:15,838
we may yet hope for better things.

910
01:08:16,957 --> 01:08:21,279
His body has suffered the ravages
of gross neglect. And...

911
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:22,837
abuse.

912
01:08:24,078 --> 01:08:25,479
Self inflicted.

913
01:08:27,917 --> 01:08:30,479
And I cannot, in all conscience,

914
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:32,479
do other than blame that woman.

915
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:35,520
That...sinful, hateful woman.

916
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:40,759
Who, with her more mature years
and social advantages,

917
01:08:40,759 --> 01:08:43,759
surely should have shown
better responsibility.

918
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,118
He has come very low.

919
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:53,118
But, you know, sometimes
a man must sink to the bottom

920
01:08:53,118 --> 01:08:55,479
before he can turn his life around.

921
01:08:55,479 --> 01:09:01,078
And perhaps that's what's happened,
what's happening.

922
01:09:01,078 --> 01:09:02,719
Here. Where's he been?

923
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:05,158
How's he been living?

924
01:09:05,158 --> 01:09:06,600
Does he want to abstain?

925
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:09,038
Oh, he has to. He has to abstain.

926
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,118
Halifax, I assume.

927
01:09:12,118 --> 01:09:15,560
I don't know. That's where
John always imagined he was.

928
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,078
Or where John knew
damned well he was.

929
01:09:18,078 --> 01:09:20,797
Have you talked to him?
About abstention?

930
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:23,399
He's asleep.

931
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:26,038
It'll only work if he's determined
to do it himself.

932
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,759
Anne. Ssh!

933
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:42,600
I...

934
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,759
Anne.

935
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:48,837
I should have done more.
At Thorp Green.

936
01:09:48,837 --> 01:09:51,759
I should have stopped him,
I should've told someone,

937
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:53,118
I should've...

938
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,719
I'm...complicit in their sin.

939
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:00,719
No, you're not.

940
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:03,319
You were in an impossible position.
I let it happen.

941
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:06,719
All I did was leave, in the end...

942
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,958
I was a coward.

943
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:14,479
A moral coward, before God.

944
01:10:22,078 --> 01:10:23,917
WOMAN LAUGHS

945
01:10:28,199 --> 01:10:31,038
CHORUS OF LAUGHTER

946
01:10:52,118 --> 01:10:54,239
LAUGHTER BECOMES MORE RIOTOUS

947
01:11:01,479 --> 01:11:03,038
Are you all right, lad?

948
01:11:34,998 --> 01:11:37,199
Lydia.

949
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:53,958
Wake up! Wake up! There's a fire.

950
01:11:53,958 --> 01:11:55,319
HE SHIVERS

951
01:11:55,319 --> 01:11:56,520
I think I've put it out.

952
01:11:57,797 --> 01:12:00,479
Branwell! Branwell! Branwell!

953
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:01,958
Look at me.

954
01:12:01,958 --> 01:12:03,319
Branwell!

955
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,158
Delirium tremens.

956
01:12:05,158 --> 01:12:06,520
It's when someone

957
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:09,640
who's been drinking solidly
for weeks suddenly stops.

958
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:15,560
Either through choice
or, more usually, lack of funds.

959
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:21,640
The body doesn't know how
to respond, so it goes into spasm.

960
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:24,719
Will it happen again?

961
01:12:25,958 --> 01:12:28,439
With care...no.

962
01:12:30,038 --> 01:12:32,640
But you do need
to keep an eye on him.

963
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,877
He's lucky.
You could've been sending

964
01:12:34,877 --> 01:12:37,600
for the undertaker this morning,
Mr Bronte, not me.

965
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:56,759
I think
rather than come back in here,

966
01:12:56,759 --> 01:13:00,759
he should stay
in my bedroom with me.

967
01:13:02,998 --> 01:13:04,560
For the time being.

968
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:24,719
I wrote a rhyme for you.

969
01:13:26,078 --> 01:13:27,439
Did you?

970
01:13:28,917 --> 01:13:31,877
Well, I wrote it, and I was thinking
about you, after I'd written it.

971
01:13:31,877 --> 01:13:32,958
So...

972
01:13:35,319 --> 01:13:36,917
It goes...

973
01:13:36,917 --> 01:13:38,958
D'you want to hear it?

974
01:13:38,958 --> 01:13:40,359
Yes.

975
01:13:42,759 --> 01:13:44,399
It starts, it's...

976
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:47,118
The first line is...

977
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,719
It goes...

978
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:52,640
"No coward soul is mine

979
01:13:54,118 --> 01:13:57,359
"No trembler in the world's

01:13:58,759 --> 01:14:00,877

01:14:00,877 --> 01:14:03,520
"And Faith shines equal
arming me from Fear..."

982
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,680
Take your time.

983
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,479
"Oh, God, within my breast...

984
01:14:11,797 --> 01:14:14,640
"Oh, God, within my breast

"Vain are the thousand creeds

"Unutterably vain,

"Worthless as withered weeds

01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,640
There's nothing
to be frightened of.

1008
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:48,560
Not for someone like you.

1009
01:15:57,797 --> 01:15:59,239
I love you.

1010
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:04,439
Good.

1011
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:08,319
I love you.

1012
01:16:15,958 --> 01:16:18,359
Who? Currer. Bell.

1013
01:16:18,359 --> 01:16:21,560
There's no-one of that name here.
No, I know that, Mr Bronte,

1014
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:25,439
only it's addressed to here, so...
That's a mystery.

1015
01:16:25,439 --> 01:16:28,239
There's no-one of that name
in the entire parish,

1016
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:29,877
as far as I'm aware.

1017
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:32,199
No, well, that's why I thought
happen a visitor.

1018
01:16:32,199 --> 01:16:35,078
No, no. No visitors.

1019
01:16:35,078 --> 01:16:36,719
Not at the moment.

1020
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:39,917
Fair enough, I'll take it back
to sorting office then.

1021
01:16:56,359 --> 01:17:00,239
Ah, morning, Miss Bronte.
Did I hear the name?

1022
01:17:01,359 --> 01:17:03,359
Currer Bell? Yes.

1023
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:07,680
Good. That's not me. Obviously.
But if I could take it,

1024
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,600
I can make sure it reaches him.

1025
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,877
Him.

1026
01:17:13,158 --> 01:17:15,958
You see, he... Papa, he forgets.

1027
01:17:15,958 --> 01:17:20,837
He's... Mr Bell, he's not here.

1028
01:17:20,837 --> 01:17:24,479
He was here. But now...he isn't.

1029
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:27,279
So, I can forward it to him.
I have his address.

1030
01:17:29,239 --> 01:17:30,680
It's a funny name.

1031
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:33,998
Currer. I thought happen it were
summat to do wi' Mr Nicholls.

1032
01:17:33,998 --> 01:17:37,078
Arthur Bell Nicholls. No.
No, no, no, that's... It's just...

1033
01:17:37,078 --> 01:17:39,719
That's just coincidental.
Can I take it?

1034
01:17:39,719 --> 01:17:42,917
Good! Well, that saves me filling in
a docket back at sorting office.

1035
01:17:42,917 --> 01:17:45,560
I'm much obliged. And so will he be.

1036
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,797
How's your...brother? Is he...?

1037
01:17:47,797 --> 01:17:49,078
Oh, he...

1038
01:17:50,359 --> 01:17:52,319
He's...you know.

1039
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:56,600
Till tomorrow, then! Miss Bronte.

1040
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,158
Bye! Bye. Bye.

1041
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:32,560
Where's Emily?

1042
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,399
Kitchen. D'you want her?

1043
01:18:36,359 --> 01:18:37,759
Letter from a publisher.

1044
01:18:41,439 --> 01:18:42,680
Emily!

1045
01:18:53,038 --> 01:18:55,158
Thomas Cautley Newby

1046
01:18:55,158 --> 01:18:58,199
is offering to publish
Wuthering Heights and Agnes Grey.

1047
01:18:58,199 --> 01:19:00,680
His terms are steep,
but he's offering to publish them,

1048
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:02,759
which is more than anyone else
has done, so...

1049
01:19:02,759 --> 01:19:04,118
What about The Professor?

1050
01:19:04,118 --> 01:19:05,279
No.

1051
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:08,439
No, he's not offering
to publish that. Why?

1052
01:19:08,439 --> 01:19:11,958
So you need to think about how you
want to approach this. No, that's...

1053
01:19:11,958 --> 01:19:14,560
We should publish them
all together or not at all. Surely.

1054
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:17,560
That's sentimental, it's kind,

1055
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,439
but it's nonsense.

1056
01:19:19,439 --> 01:19:21,917
This is a solid offer,
not a generous one, as I say,

1057
01:19:21,917 --> 01:19:25,078
but I'll persevere in sending out
The Professor

1058
01:19:25,078 --> 01:19:27,719
and with the other one
that I've been writing.

1059
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:30,797
But in the meantime, you've got
a choice to make. Read it.

1060
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:35,600
He's asking for you to provide
an advance of ã50

1061
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,199
towards the cost of publication.

1062
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:40,319
But clearly he believes it's viable
or he wouldn't make the offer.

1063
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:43,837
This is addressed to Currer Bell.
Yes. That was interesting.

1064
01:19:43,837 --> 01:19:47,520
You didn't...
Of course not! I had to...

1065
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,640
..fib.

1066
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:52,078
ã50.

1067
01:19:52,078 --> 01:19:55,759
Perhaps that's normal. Perhaps
whoever undertook to publish it

1068
01:19:55,759 --> 01:19:57,917
would ask for an advance
of that sort.

1069
01:19:57,917 --> 01:20:01,680
We're a risk, we're unknown, despite
the poems. Because of the poems.

1070
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:03,239
Two copies sold.

1071
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,877
You will...persist?

1072
01:20:06,877 --> 01:20:08,759
Oh, yes.

1073
01:20:28,998 --> 01:20:30,958
BANGING ON DOOR

1074
01:20:38,118 --> 01:20:39,479
Yes?

1075
01:20:39,479 --> 01:20:41,719
I'd like to speak to Mr Bronte.

1076
01:20:41,719 --> 01:20:43,118
The Reverend Bronte?

1077
01:20:43,118 --> 01:20:45,038
Mr Patrick Bronte.

1078
01:20:45,038 --> 01:20:47,158
What shall I say it's to do with?

1079
01:20:47,158 --> 01:20:48,759
Is he in?

1080
01:20:48,759 --> 01:20:50,399
Who wants to know?

1081
01:20:50,399 --> 01:20:53,118
I'm a bailiff of the county
appointed by Mr Rawson,

1082
01:20:53,118 --> 01:20:54,797
the magistrate at Halifax.

1083
01:20:54,797 --> 01:20:57,640
I'm here about an unpaid debt.
Is Mr Bronte in?

1084
01:20:58,680 --> 01:20:59,998
I'll...

1085
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:04,038
You'll just have to
give me a minute.

1086
01:21:11,279 --> 01:21:13,279
SHE KNOCKS ON DOOR

1087
01:21:13,279 --> 01:21:14,319
Yes?

1088
01:21:16,998 --> 01:21:19,837
The's a man at the door, Mr Bronte.

1089
01:21:19,837 --> 01:21:23,239
He says he's here about
an unpaid debt.

1090
01:21:23,239 --> 01:21:26,958
He says he's been sent
by a magistrate at Halifax.

1091
01:21:46,439 --> 01:21:50,600
Now, then, gentlemen. How may I help
you? Mr Patrick Bronte? Yes.

1092
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:53,837
I'm appointed by the Magistrate
at Halifax to collect a debt of

1093
01:21:53,837 --> 01:21:55,479
ã14, 10s 6d,

1094
01:21:55,479 --> 01:21:58,479
owing to Mr Crowther of the
Commercial in Northgate, Halifax,

1095
01:21:58,479 --> 01:22:00,759
and now outstanding
for a total of eight months.

1096
01:22:00,759 --> 01:22:04,359
What's going on?
Branwell, what's going on?

1097
01:22:04,359 --> 01:22:05,759
Branwell...

1098
01:22:05,759 --> 01:22:07,958
Shift. Shift...

1099
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:14,479
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1100
01:22:14,479 --> 01:22:17,319
Not so fast, little fella.
Steady now!

1101
01:22:17,319 --> 01:22:18,998
You don't want me to hurt you.

1102
01:22:18,998 --> 01:22:22,680
And you don't want to hurt me,
cos, if you do,

1103
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,279
there'll be bother. Get off me!

1104
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,998
I think it must be
my son that you want.

1105
01:22:27,998 --> 01:22:31,479
Your son? Right, well,
where is your son, Mr Bronte?

1106
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:33,439
I've got him, Mr Riley!

1107
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:39,399
Emily! Get him off me! I can't
breathe, Emily! Stop wriggling!

1108
01:22:39,399 --> 01:22:42,239
Stop struggling! You're not going
anywhere! I've done nothing wrong!

1109
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:44,719
You've got the wrong man!
What were you legging it for then?

1110
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:46,600
And why did you try and hit me,
you little twat.

1111
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:49,319
Get your hands off me!
Are you Patrick Bronte? Up!

1112
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,239
Are you Patrick Branwell Bronte?

1113
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:55,877
Answer the man!

1114
01:22:55,877 --> 01:22:57,958
I have no idea who these people are.

1115
01:22:59,078 --> 01:23:02,797
You owe money
to some publican in Halifax.

1116
01:23:02,797 --> 01:23:04,837
And if the debt isn't paid,

1117
01:23:04,837 --> 01:23:07,399
they'll take you
to the debtors' prison.

1118
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:09,279
You'd best pay up then, eh?

1119
01:23:13,078 --> 01:23:14,239
Take him.

1120
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:15,719
What?

1121
01:23:15,719 --> 01:23:19,239
No! Papa, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1122
01:23:19,239 --> 01:23:22,399
I didn't mean it! I'm sorry!
Charlotte! Emily!

1123
01:23:22,399 --> 01:23:26,038
We have money. We have money!
We have money, please stop them.

1124
01:23:26,038 --> 01:23:27,439
Please. Hang on, boys!

1125
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:40,078
Bring him back. If it's all right
with you, Reverend,

1126
01:23:40,078 --> 01:23:43,479
my colleagues'll keep hold of him
until I've got the remittance.

1127
01:23:43,479 --> 01:23:45,439
I shall require a receipt.

1128
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:48,319
I shall give you one.

1129
01:24:22,359 --> 01:24:23,680
Come on.

1130
01:24:29,319 --> 01:24:31,038
It's all right.

1131
01:24:41,399 --> 01:24:44,118
"Gentlemen. I have received
your communication

1132
01:24:44,118 --> 01:24:46,640
"of the 5th instant,
for which I thank you.

1133
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:49,600
"Your objection to the want of
varied interest in The Professor is,

1134
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,837
"I am aware, not without grounds.

1135
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:54,479
"I have a second narrative
in three volumes now completed,

1136
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:57,118
"to which I have endeavoured
to impart a more vivid interest

1137
01:24:57,118 --> 01:24:58,719
"than belongs to The Professor.

1138
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:02,439
"I send you per rail a manuscript,
entitled Jane Eyre,

1139
01:25:02,439 --> 01:25:05,279
"a novel in three volumes

1140
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:23,958
VOICES IN ANOTHER ROOM

1141
01:26:23,958 --> 01:26:26,719
BRANWELL: One of us is not going to
leave that room alive!

1142
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:29,600
I will either kill you
or I will kill myself!

1143
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,759
Do you want me to kill myself? Eh?

1144
01:26:31,759 --> 01:26:34,439
Cos if I do, old man,
you can rest assured

1145
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:36,479
that you'll have driven me to it

1146
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:39,439
with your endless prayers
and your drivel!

1147
01:26:39,439 --> 01:26:44,158
Can you not understand,
can you not get the idea

1148
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:49,319
that the only...only respite I have
from the misery of my existence

1149
01:26:49,319 --> 01:26:52,917
is being allowed
a little bit of something to drink.

1150
01:26:52,917 --> 01:26:55,319
I'm only asking for a shilling,
for God's sake!

1151
01:26:55,319 --> 01:26:57,078
Just...just take it.

1152
01:27:17,038 --> 01:27:20,958
He'll just go on and on until
he gets what he wants anyway.

1153
01:27:21,998 --> 01:27:23,239
And I just...

1154
01:27:25,078 --> 01:27:27,640
..I don't always have the energy...

1155
01:27:28,998 --> 01:27:30,038
..any more.

1156
01:27:58,998 --> 01:28:02,279
I know this is contradicting
what I've said before, but...

1157
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,877
..my second thoughts are,
occasionally,

1158
01:28:05,877 --> 01:28:07,399
better than my first ones.

1159
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:11,118
I think you should tell Papa
about Jane Eyre.

1160
01:28:12,877 --> 01:28:14,759
About how successful it's been.

1161
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:18,759
Why?

1162
01:28:18,759 --> 01:28:21,279
I think it would help him to know

1163
01:28:21,279 --> 01:28:24,520
that we now seem to have found
a means of supporting ourselves,

1164
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:28,680
possibly, in the event of...
whenever something happens to him.

1165
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:31,837
Why Jane Eyre?

1166
01:28:31,837 --> 01:28:35,640
No, we'll tell him about everything,
but just...as a way in.

1167
01:28:36,877 --> 01:28:40,118
But then...he'll read it.

1168
01:28:44,279 --> 01:28:45,719
Now?

1169
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:49,199
SHE KNOCKS

1170
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:50,399
Hello?

1171
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:53,038
Papa?

1172
01:29:55,038 --> 01:29:57,158
Have you got a moment?

1173
01:29:57,158 --> 01:29:58,719
Yeah, quickly.

1174
01:30:02,319 --> 01:30:03,797
I've...

1175
01:30:05,158 --> 01:30:07,439
I've...I've been writing a book.

1176
01:30:07,439 --> 01:30:10,520
A book. And... Oh, well...

1177
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:13,038
Would you like to read it?

1178
01:30:13,038 --> 01:30:15,038
No, I can't.

1179
01:30:15,038 --> 01:30:16,560
I don't have time.

1180
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:20,520
And you know, with your tiny,
little writing, I can't see it.

1181
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:21,640
But well done.

1182
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:27,520
The thing is, you see...
it's published.

1183
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:29,199
It's been published,

1184
01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:33,917
it's a properly published...
it's a book in three volumes.

1185
01:30:38,837 --> 01:30:40,560
Well, well!

1186
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,118
Currer Bell.

1187
01:30:46,118 --> 01:30:48,759
No, he's famous, he's...
No, that's me.

1188
01:30:49,837 --> 01:30:52,479
That's you? What's you?!

1189
01:30:52,479 --> 01:30:53,719
That...

1190
01:30:53,719 --> 01:30:56,359
I've published under a pseudonym.

1191
01:30:56,359 --> 01:30:59,319
Currer Bell.
You see, it's the same initials.

1192
01:30:59,319 --> 01:31:02,479
And the thing is, it's just about
to go into a second edition.

1193
01:31:02,479 --> 01:31:05,118
It's...sold a lot of copies.

1194
01:31:05,118 --> 01:31:07,877
It's been really
quite unusually successful.

1195
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:12,837
There's a stage play of it
in rehearsal as we speak

1196
01:31:12,837 --> 01:31:15,837
at a theatre in...
the Victoria Theatre, in fact,

1197
01:31:15,837 --> 01:31:17,199
in London.

1198
01:31:18,759 --> 01:31:20,719
It's been so, um...

1199
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:23,038
hugely well received.

1200
01:31:24,797 --> 01:31:25,998
But I...

1201
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:30,319
So...you're...?

1202
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:34,078
You're...?! Yes.

1203
01:31:34,078 --> 01:31:36,680
And...I've made money.

1204
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:39,038
With the prospect of making
quite a lot more.

1205
01:31:39,038 --> 01:31:43,319
And if we...if I continue
to work hard

1206
01:31:43,319 --> 01:31:45,078
and produce the kind of writing

1207
01:31:45,078 --> 01:31:47,118
that people are prepared
to pay money for,

1208
01:31:47,118 --> 01:31:50,759
then it should furnish us
with a comfortable existence.

1209
01:31:54,917 --> 01:31:57,118
Would you like me to read you
some of the reviews?

1210
01:31:57,118 --> 01:31:59,038
Well, I...

1211
01:31:59,038 --> 01:32:01,158
HE LAUGHS

1212
01:32:02,439 --> 01:32:06,199
Why have you kept it such a secret?
To protect ourselves.

1213
01:32:06,199 --> 01:32:09,958
We've been accused of
vulgarity and coarseness.

1214
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:13,078
I have "forfeited my right to be
called a member of the fairer sex"

1215
01:32:13,078 --> 01:32:14,719
according to Lady Eastlake,

1216
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:17,479
who speculates that Currer Bell
might actually be a woman

1217
01:32:17,479 --> 01:32:20,479
and complicit in the revolutions
throughout Europe.

1218
01:32:20,479 --> 01:32:24,359
"We do not hesitate to say
that the tone of mind and thought

1219
01:32:24,359 --> 01:32:28,158
"which has overthrown authority
and violated every code -

1220
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:30,078
"human and divine - abroad,

1221
01:32:30,078 --> 01:32:32,759
"and fostered Chartism
and rebellion at home,

1222
01:32:32,759 --> 01:32:35,279
"is the same which has also written
Jane Eyre."

1223
01:32:35,279 --> 01:32:36,399
Jane Eyre.

1224
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:40,520
And why is it vulgar?
It isn't, Papa!

1225
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:43,797
People are just squeamish about
the truth, about real life.

1226
01:32:43,797 --> 01:32:46,797
Our work is clever.
It's truthful.

1227
01:32:46,797 --> 01:32:50,837
It's new, it's fresh, it's vivid
and subtle and forthright.

1228
01:32:51,998 --> 01:32:56,239
But...more importantly,
the point is...

1229
01:32:58,038 --> 01:32:59,719
..we didn't want Branwell to know.

1230
01:33:00,797 --> 01:33:03,877
That's first and foremost
why we've kept it a secret.

1231
01:33:03,877 --> 01:33:06,078
It's not that he'd be scathing,
we can stand that.

1232
01:33:06,078 --> 01:33:08,319
It's because it's what
he always wanted to do.

1233
01:33:08,319 --> 01:33:11,078
And now it looks less and less
likely that he ever will,

1234
01:33:11,078 --> 01:33:13,359
it'd be like rubbing salt
into a wound.

1235
01:33:13,359 --> 01:33:16,640
No-one can ever know who we are.
We've agreed.

1236
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:19,038
We just didn't want you
to worry that we weren't

1237
01:33:19,038 --> 01:33:22,199
doing anything with ourselves,
because we have been. We are!

1238
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:25,998
So, who else knows, besides me?

1239
01:33:25,998 --> 01:33:28,038
No-one. I've not even told Ellen.

1240
01:33:28,038 --> 01:33:29,520
Tabby?

1241
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:32,399
No-one. The publishers
don't even know who we are.

1242
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:33,958
They think we're three men.

1243
01:33:33,958 --> 01:33:37,600
We'd like to keep it that way.
We just wanted you to know.

1244
01:33:39,958 --> 01:33:41,600
HE SIGHS

1245
01:33:44,359 --> 01:33:45,917
Little Helen Burns.

1246
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:50,998
That's your little sister, Maria.

1247
01:33:52,239 --> 01:33:54,158
Maria was our big sister.

1248
01:33:55,239 --> 01:33:57,239
Yeah. Of course she was.

1249
01:34:00,279 --> 01:34:01,917
Of course she was.

1250
01:34:03,719 --> 01:34:07,279
Not a day passes
when I don't think about her.

1251
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:11,877
And little Elizabeth.

1252
01:34:14,359 --> 01:34:15,797
And your mother.

1253
01:34:28,958 --> 01:34:31,399
I am very proud of you.

1254
01:34:39,797 --> 01:34:41,877
I always have been.

1255
01:34:43,917 --> 01:34:45,837
CHURCH BELLS RING

1256
01:34:56,118 --> 01:34:57,359

HE COUGHS

1268
01:36:10,797 --> 01:36:13,319
BELLS CONTINUE RINGING

1269
01:36:52,399 --> 01:36:53,797
(Have you got a minute?)

1270
01:37:05,958 --> 01:37:08,877
What?
We're going to have to go to London.

1271
01:37:08,877 --> 01:37:12,319
Who is? We are. All three of us.

1272
01:37:12,319 --> 01:37:14,680
When? Today.

1273
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:16,239
Why?

1274
01:37:19,797 --> 01:37:21,877
Your...

1275
01:37:21,877 --> 01:37:26,560
Mr Newby must've... I don't know...

1276
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:29,199
sold the first few pages of
The Tenant Of Wildfell Hall

1277
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:31,520
to an American publisher
on the understanding

1278
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:33,199
that it was written Currer Bell.

1279
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:35,600
Well, it's obviously
a misunderstanding.

1280
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,399
No. Will you...

1281
01:37:37,399 --> 01:37:39,158
please...see

1282
01:37:39,158 --> 01:37:42,759
that this man is a con man.
A rogue!

1283
01:37:42,759 --> 01:37:45,600
How many mistakes did
he print in Wuthering Heights?

1284
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:48,359
Proofs that you painstakingly
corrected that he ignored,

1285
01:37:48,359 --> 01:37:51,118
and now this.
My publisher is livid

1286
01:37:51,118 --> 01:37:54,359
that I could have sold my next novel
to another publisher.

1287
01:37:54,359 --> 01:37:56,359
They have first refusal
of my next two novels,

1288
01:37:56,359 --> 01:37:59,279
and now they think I'm some kind of
unscrupulous double-dealer!

1289
01:37:59,279 --> 01:38:01,837
Well, just write and explain. No.

1290
01:38:01,837 --> 01:38:05,038
No, we have to go to London

1291
01:38:05,038 --> 01:38:07,797
and give ocular proof
that we are three separate people,

1292
01:38:07,797 --> 01:38:10,038
the novels are not all the work
of one person,

1293
01:38:10,038 --> 01:38:12,399
and that this is absolute trash.

1294
01:38:12,399 --> 01:38:14,038
Well, I'm not going.

1295
01:38:14,038 --> 01:38:18,640
Why? Because you can write a letter
and explain all that,

1296
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:22,319
and just say that Newby's made
a mistake. This is not a mistake!

1297
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:24,877
This is a deliberate
and deceitful attempt

1298
01:38:24,877 --> 01:38:27,118
to cash in on the success
of Jane Eyre. Sorry.

1299
01:38:27,118 --> 01:38:29,078
It isn't! It is!

1300
01:38:29,078 --> 01:38:32,319
Newby has made the mistake,
along with a lot of other people,

1301
01:38:32,319 --> 01:38:35,199
of assuming we're all one person,
that is all it is.

1302
01:38:35,199 --> 01:38:37,759
Why are you so obtuse?

1303
01:38:37,759 --> 01:38:39,877
Why are you so melodramatic?

1304
01:38:39,877 --> 01:38:41,118
Emily!

1305
01:38:41,118 --> 01:38:44,078
I don't want The Tenant
Of Wildfell Hall promoted and sold

1306
01:38:44,078 --> 01:38:46,877
on a deceitful...
misunderstanding, whichever,

1307
01:38:46,877 --> 01:38:48,877
that it's by anyone other than me.

1308
01:38:48,877 --> 01:38:50,837
We have to go to London.

1309
01:38:50,837 --> 01:38:52,118
Now.

1310
01:38:52,118 --> 01:38:53,759
Today.

1311
01:38:53,759 --> 01:38:56,439
And explain to Mr Smith and Mr
Smith Williams what's happened.

1312
01:38:56,439 --> 01:38:59,640
It's intolerable to imagine they
could think I could be so slippery.

1313
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:01,078
But, wait, look, you can't.

1314
01:39:01,078 --> 01:39:03,439
You can't go to London
and explain who you are

1315
01:39:03,439 --> 01:39:05,680
because they will see you.
That's the whole point.

1316
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:08,118
Yes, and you promised -
you promised me -

1317
01:39:08,118 --> 01:39:11,038
that we would never reveal ourselves
to anyone. Ever.

1318
01:39:11,038 --> 01:39:12,560
Well...

1319
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:16,719
I'm afraid because of
your...Mr Newby...

1320
01:39:17,719 --> 01:39:21,279
..we now find ourselves in a...
situation.

1321
01:39:21,279 --> 01:39:23,837
Emily...I think we should go.

1322
01:39:23,837 --> 01:39:25,719
No! You're not going, either.

1323
01:39:25,719 --> 01:39:27,520
No, I am! No, you're not.

1324
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:30,279
Newby's compromised my integrity
just as much as Charlotte's.

1325
01:39:30,279 --> 01:39:32,359
I shan't publish with him again.

1326
01:39:32,359 --> 01:39:36,158
If you won't come with us,
that's...that's your choice.

1327
01:39:36,158 --> 01:39:38,917
We don't need to fall out
about this, Emily.

1328
01:39:38,917 --> 01:39:41,279
It's about your novel -
and your name.

1329
01:39:41,279 --> 01:39:43,239
It's got NOTHING to do with me!

1330
01:39:44,759 --> 01:39:46,359
Don't be like that, Em...

1331
01:40:03,359 --> 01:40:05,479
What's the matter?

1332
01:40:08,917 --> 01:40:10,439
Emily.

1333
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:20,877
Yes, but you do know her bark's
worse than her bite, don't you?

1334
01:40:28,199 --> 01:40:30,917
TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS

1335
01:41:42,359 --> 01:41:43,877
Charlotte...

1336
01:41:43,877 --> 01:41:45,399
Jane Eyre.

1337
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:47,958
Look.

1338
01:42:04,038 --> 01:42:05,877
Can I help you, ladies?

1339
01:42:07,479 --> 01:42:08,958
Yes.

1340
01:42:10,759 --> 01:42:12,479
Yes, I'd...

1341
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:21,038
We'd like to speak to
Mr George Smith, please.

1342
01:42:21,038 --> 01:42:22,520
Mr Smith?

1343
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:24,199
Mr Smith's very busy.

1344
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:26,479
Yes...

1345
01:42:28,078 --> 01:42:30,837
But the thing is, you see...
It's important.

1346
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:34,199
Can I tell him what it's about?

1347
01:42:34,199 --> 01:42:35,759
Just...

1348
01:42:37,038 --> 01:42:39,319
Just that it's a matter
of importance.

1349
01:42:40,797 --> 01:42:43,399
I'll, er... I'll see what...

1350
01:42:43,399 --> 01:42:45,239
I'll see if he's got a minute.

1351
01:42:45,239 --> 01:42:48,560
Who should I say is asking
to see him? It's...

1352
01:42:50,759 --> 01:42:52,038
That's delicate.

1353
01:42:52,038 --> 01:42:53,680
He is a very busy man.

1354
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:56,439
We've been travelling
for 17 hours,

1355
01:42:56,439 --> 01:42:59,479
and we'll take up less than
one minute of his time.

1356
01:43:10,239 --> 01:43:12,560
Sir, two ladies asking to see you.
What ladies?

1357
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:14,479
Didn't give a name, sir.
What's it about?

1358
01:43:14,479 --> 01:43:17,158
The only thing I could prise out,
sir, is that it's important.

1359
01:43:17,158 --> 01:43:21,038
To me or to them? They've asked for
no more than a minute of your time.

1360
01:43:21,038 --> 01:43:24,279
They say they've travelled
for 17 hours.

1361
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:33,680
Ladies. How can I help you?

1362
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:38,319
Am I addressing Mr George Smith?
Yes.

1363
01:43:40,319 --> 01:43:42,199
It's a confidential matter.

1364
01:43:53,279 --> 01:43:54,399
We're...

1365
01:43:55,680 --> 01:43:58,199
We're here to address
a misunderstanding,

1366
01:43:58,199 --> 01:44:01,038
which, once accomplished,
will be to everyone's advantage,

1367
01:44:01,038 --> 01:44:02,640
yours as much as ours.

1368
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:05,680
And so we apologise
for what must be an interruption

1369
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:07,118
to your morning's work.

1370
01:44:07,118 --> 01:44:10,399
But perhaps if I gave you this,
it would clarify who we are.

1371
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:16,319
Where did you get this letter?

1372
01:44:16,319 --> 01:44:18,680
In the post. From you.

1373
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:19,958
You sent it to me.

1374
01:44:23,158 --> 01:44:26,158
I am...Currer Bell.

1375
01:44:27,319 --> 01:44:29,158
C Bronte, that's me.

1376
01:44:29,158 --> 01:44:31,038
And this is Acton Bell,

1377
01:44:31,038 --> 01:44:32,479
author of Agnes Grey.

1378
01:44:32,479 --> 01:44:36,118
The point is, author of
The Tenant Of Wildfell Hall, not me.

1379
01:44:36,118 --> 01:44:40,279
And Ellis couldn't come.
Ellis didn't want to come.

1380
01:44:40,279 --> 01:44:44,239
Ellis is... Anyway...the point is...

1381
01:44:44,239 --> 01:44:46,279
we are three sisters.

1382
01:44:47,479 --> 01:44:50,038
I have not sold the first few pages
of my next novel

1383
01:44:50,038 --> 01:44:53,319
to an America publisher, as claimed
by Mr Thomas Cautley Newby.

1384
01:44:53,319 --> 01:44:55,877
That is not my novel, it's Acton's.

1385
01:44:55,877 --> 01:44:59,998
I...Mr Smith, have nothing, exactly
nothing, to do with Mr Newby.

1386
01:44:59,998 --> 01:45:02,958
And nor will my sister, now she has
seen him in his true colours.

1387
01:45:02,958 --> 01:45:05,359
We are people of integrity.

1388
01:45:05,359 --> 01:45:07,078
And probity.

1389
01:45:07,078 --> 01:45:10,239
And that is why we are here.

1390
01:45:10,239 --> 01:45:11,600
To set matters straight.

1391
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:13,719
Sorry, you're...

1392
01:45:14,917 --> 01:45:17,078
You are Currer Bell?

1393
01:45:17,078 --> 01:45:19,759
What makes you doubt it, Mr Smith?

1394
01:45:19,759 --> 01:45:22,359
My accent? My gender? My size?

1395
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:29,680
Oh, good heavens!

1396
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:31,359
Oh, good Lord!

1397
01:45:31,359 --> 01:45:34,719
Forgive me, I'm sorry.

1398
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:38,719
I'm sorry, too,
we've caught you off-guard.

1399
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:41,797
But you see, we felt it best
to come and see you in person,

1400
01:45:41,797 --> 01:45:44,078
given the tone of your letter.

1401
01:45:44,078 --> 01:45:47,158
I wanted no room left for any
further misunderstanding or doubt.

1402
01:45:47,158 --> 01:45:49,640
That's deeply, deeply appreciated,
Miss...

1403
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:50,917
BOTH: Bronte.

1404
01:45:50,917 --> 01:45:53,078
And a great relief, of course.

1405
01:45:53,078 --> 01:45:55,877
Have you really been travelling
for 17 hours?

1406
01:45:55,877 --> 01:45:58,998
Through the night. Such was
the tone of your letter that..

1407
01:45:58,998 --> 01:46:00,439
You must be exhausted.

1408
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:04,439
Oddly, Mr Smith,
I feel extraordinarily awake.

1409
01:46:04,439 --> 01:46:05,759
Where are you staying?

1410
01:46:05,759 --> 01:46:08,680
We've booked into the Chapter
Coffee House. In Paternoster Row.

1411
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:11,998
Our father stayed there briefly
before he went up to Cambridge.

1412
01:46:11,998 --> 01:46:17,560
And my sister and I,
my other sister, Ellis, did once,

1413
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:21,837
before we travelled to Brussels.
You've taken my breath away.

1414
01:46:21,837 --> 01:46:25,520
Miss Bronte.
Oh, you have to meet people.

1415
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:28,917
Have you any idea how many people
want to... Thackeray!

1416
01:46:28,917 --> 01:46:32,439
Thackeray, Thackeray...
Thackeray will have to meet you.

1417
01:46:32,439 --> 01:46:33,680
Er...Kent, Kent.

1418
01:46:34,759 --> 01:46:38,600
Kent! Fetch Smith Williams!
You have to meet Smith Williams.

1419
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:42,279
He...he is such an admirer
of...of...of...

1420
01:46:42,279 --> 01:46:43,600
He was...

1421
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:45,279
..of your genius.

1422
01:46:45,279 --> 01:46:51,239
He was the one that read...that read
The Professor, and saw instantly,

1423
01:46:51,239 --> 01:46:54,239
before Jane Eyre -
which is glorious, by the way -

1424
01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:56,399
um, he saw...

1425
01:46:56,399 --> 01:46:59,600
he saw, he saw, Miss Bronte.

1426
01:47:02,199 --> 01:47:06,640
The whole of literary London -
the whole of London -

1427
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:09,038
will fall over itself
to spend a minute

1428
01:47:09,038 --> 01:47:10,958
in the company of Currer Bell.

1429
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:13,917
Um, somebody really needs

1430
01:47:13,917 --> 01:47:16,759
to do something about this Mr Newby,
though, Mr Smith.

1431
01:47:16,759 --> 01:47:19,038
Absolutely, indeed.
He will be dealt with.

1432
01:47:19,038 --> 01:47:21,917
Please, please, come through
to my office.

1433
01:47:21,917 --> 01:47:23,680
Ah, Smith Williams!

1434
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:24,998
This...

1435
01:47:24,998 --> 01:47:26,680
This is...

1436
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:28,199
Currer Bell.

1437
01:47:31,038 --> 01:47:32,877
Oh, how perfect.

1438
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:39,078
How delightful.

1439
01:47:39,078 --> 01:47:41,319
And this is Acton...Bell.

1440
01:47:42,359 --> 01:47:44,877
Ellis couldn't come.
Do you like opera?

1441
01:47:57,479 --> 01:47:59,600
BRANWELL COUGHS

1442
01:48:05,399 --> 01:48:08,078
I'll see to him,
I'll sit with him.

1443
01:48:10,837 --> 01:48:11,958
Are you sure?

1444
01:48:11,958 --> 01:48:13,837
You go sleep in their bed.

1445
01:48:13,837 --> 01:48:15,038
Branwell.

1446
01:48:16,118 --> 01:48:17,600
I'm going to be sick.

1447
01:48:18,877 --> 01:48:21,319
HE VOMITS

1448
01:48:44,118 --> 01:48:46,399
You're back!

1449
01:48:46,399 --> 01:48:49,560
That was quick!
All the way to London.

1450
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:52,640
How were things here? Oh, well,

1451
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:56,917
we've had sad work with Branwell.
But other than that...

1452
01:48:56,917 --> 01:48:59,279
Good. Good.

1453
01:49:06,359 --> 01:49:09,600
You're the last person in the world
I want to fall out with.

1454
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:10,719
I know.

1455
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:25,199
We only told Mr Smith
and Mr Smith Williams.

1456
01:49:25,199 --> 01:49:27,158
Well, and Newby, later.

1457
01:49:27,158 --> 01:49:30,877
No-one else. We made it clear they
hadn't to tell anyone else either.

1458
01:49:30,877 --> 01:49:33,199
They took us
to the Royal Opera House,

1459
01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:34,837
Mr Smith and Mr Smith Williams did,

1460
01:49:34,837 --> 01:49:36,759
with Mr Smith's mother
and his sisters,

1461
01:49:36,759 --> 01:49:38,917
and us with nothing to wear
but what we'd gone in.

1462
01:49:38,917 --> 01:49:40,520
They'd no idea who we were!

1463
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:43,239
Heaven alone knows what
they must have thought about us.

1464
01:49:45,158 --> 01:49:46,600
He's...

1465
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:50,038
What?

1466
01:49:53,199 --> 01:49:54,520
Branwell.

1467
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:56,877
He's been vomiting blood.

1468
01:50:09,958 --> 01:50:11,520
"Dear Ellen,

1469
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:13,199
"I received your letter informing us

1470
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:15,917
"of the time of your arrival
in Keighley with great delight.

1471
01:50:15,917 --> 01:50:18,719
"Emily and Anne anticipate
your long-delayed visit

1472
01:50:18,719 --> 01:50:20,560
"as eagerly as I do, myself.

1473
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:23,877
"We will be outside the Devonshire
Arms promptly at two o'clock.

1474
01:50:23,877 --> 01:50:26,199
"Wishing you a safe
and comfortable journey."

1475
01:50:26,199 --> 01:50:27,837
Anyone for Keighley?

1476
01:50:32,078 --> 01:50:33,640
Ellen!

1477
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:35,158
Charlotte!

1478
01:50:36,837 --> 01:50:38,279
Emily!

1479
01:50:38,279 --> 01:50:40,239
Anne! Miss Nussey.

1480
01:50:40,239 --> 01:50:42,118
Which one's your box?
Is it this one?

1481
01:50:42,118 --> 01:50:44,118
Yes, that one there.
How was your journey?

1482
01:50:44,118 --> 01:50:45,199
Long, tiresome.

1483
01:50:45,199 --> 01:50:46,917
We haven't seen you for so long.

1484
01:50:46,917 --> 01:50:48,600
I know, I've missed you.

1485
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:50,239
Shall we go? Yes.

1486
01:51:00,279 --> 01:51:03,199
In the end I realised
we'd delay your visit forever

1487
01:51:03,199 --> 01:51:04,399
if we weren't careful.

1488
01:51:04,399 --> 01:51:05,958
And he's so quiet now.

1489
01:51:05,958 --> 01:51:09,640
We barely see him during the day.
He just sleeps.

1490
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:12,877
I think more people have crosses
to bear than we realise.

1491
01:51:12,877 --> 01:51:15,078
On the domestic side.

1492
01:51:15,078 --> 01:51:16,640
On the quiet.

1493
01:51:18,319 --> 01:51:20,680
The oddest thing -
I think I told you -

1494
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:24,359
The Robinson girls, you know the
youngest two, Elizabeth and Mary?

1495
01:51:24,359 --> 01:51:26,600
They've started writing to Anne.

1496
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:29,877
About six months after
their father died.

1497
01:51:29,877 --> 01:51:33,399
I mean, they're very fond of Anne,
more than she imagined.

1498
01:51:33,399 --> 01:51:35,877
Then they wanted to visit. Here.

1499
01:51:37,399 --> 01:51:40,199
So we let them,
and they came last week.

1500
01:51:40,199 --> 01:51:42,877
Of course, Branwell knew
nothing about it.

1501
01:51:42,877 --> 01:51:45,680
What were they like? Oh.

1502
01:51:45,680 --> 01:51:47,359
You know.

1503
01:51:47,359 --> 01:51:49,917
Pretty. Vacuous.

1504
01:51:49,917 --> 01:51:51,958
Non-stop yak-yak-yak.

1505
01:51:51,958 --> 01:51:53,877
Emily popped her head in,

1506
01:51:53,877 --> 01:51:56,479
purely to satisfy her own curiosity,
of course,

1507
01:51:56,479 --> 01:51:59,199
and then, after approximately
four seconds, withdrew.

1508
01:51:59,199 --> 01:52:02,359
It's one of the few occasions
I've really enjoyed her surliness.

1509
01:52:02,359 --> 01:52:07,199
Anyway, the point is,
they told us last week...

1510
01:52:09,279 --> 01:52:10,640
..that their mother...

1511
01:52:12,038 --> 01:52:13,759
What?

1512
01:52:17,158 --> 01:52:18,917
..is going to marry...

1513
01:52:18,917 --> 01:52:20,797
Sir Edward Scott.

1514
01:52:20,797 --> 01:52:24,239
So much for contrition
and guilt and madness

1515
01:52:24,239 --> 01:52:26,399
and clauses in people's wills.

1516
01:52:26,399 --> 01:52:28,759
He's been very sadly used, Branwell.

1517
01:52:30,118 --> 01:52:31,399
You didn't tell him?

1518
01:52:32,399 --> 01:52:33,998
What purpose would it serve?

1519
01:52:35,439 --> 01:52:37,998
I'm sorry to inflict
all this on you, Ellen.

1520
01:52:37,998 --> 01:52:41,399
Charlotte, I'm your oldest friend.

1521
01:52:41,399 --> 01:52:43,917
You can tell me anything,
you know that.

1522
01:52:45,279 --> 01:52:46,479
Look!

1523
01:52:50,199 --> 01:52:52,680
What is that? It's extraordinary.

1524
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:54,078
It's three suns!

1525
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,680
What is it? It's beautiful.

1526
01:53:01,078 --> 01:53:02,560
It's you three.

1527
01:53:30,158 --> 01:53:32,399
You can go now.

1528
01:54:50,479 --> 01:54:53,719
You'll have to sit him up
to get his shirt off.

1529
01:55:50,837 --> 01:55:54,998
'Tis a shame you're embarked on this
course of myopic self-destruction!

1530
01:55:54,998 --> 01:55:57,078
'I despise everything you stand for!

1531
01:55:57,078 --> 01:55:59,279
'Revolution is in the air!

1532
01:55:59,279 --> 01:56:02,439
'Only a fool like you, sir,
would ignore it!'

1533
01:56:42,797 --> 01:56:45,279
..this is the famous
dining room table,

1534
01:56:45,279 --> 01:56:47,719
at which the sisters used to sit
and write.

1535
01:58:37,239 --> 01:58:40,797
Have you been inspired by the story
of the Bronte sisters?

1536
01:58:40,797 --> 01:58:45,239
To unlock your own creativity, and
watch behind-the-scenes interviews

1537
01:58:45,239 --> 01:58:47,199
with the cast and crew go to...
