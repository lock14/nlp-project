1
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,877
THE COUNTERFEITERS

2
00:00:59,844 --> 00:01:03,804
THE WAR IS OVER

3
00:01:14,558 --> 00:01:17,059
BEAUTIFUL SHORE

4
00:02:12,743 --> 00:02:13,909
Monsieur Sorowitsch?

5
00:02:13,993 --> 00:02:16,243
I'm afraid we require a deposit.

6
00:02:26,955 --> 00:02:29,540
$200 is more than enough.

7
00:02:38,543 --> 00:02:40,793
Is this your first visit
to Monte Carlo?

8
00:02:59,091 --> 00:03:01,717
Excellent.
That's going to be fine.

9
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:03,967
Little adjustment here, that's all.

10
00:03:28,226 --> 00:03:30,894
PRIVATE ROOM

11
00:03:42,272 --> 00:03:43,522
Cheers.

12
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:18,368
What's that?

13
00:04:23,576 --> 00:04:25,535
You're not from a camp,
are you?

14
00:04:50,586 --> 00:04:51,753
I'm not a...

15
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:31,432
Sally!

16
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:39,435
Schmitz!

17
00:05:40,769 --> 00:05:43,352
Where's the other 150?

18
00:05:43,435 --> 00:05:46,604
Know how risky it is
off-loading your duds?

19
00:05:46,687 --> 00:05:47,854
Sally!

20
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:53,689
Can you lend me something?
Twenty?

21
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:57,191
Come over all political?

22
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,358
Ludwig here took me along
to a meeting.

23
00:05:59,441 --> 00:06:01,191
Heil! Heil! Heil!

24
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:04,193
And I've joined them too!

25
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:06,027
Look!

26
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:08,694
He gave it to me
'cause I'm so kind to him!

27
00:06:08,778 --> 00:06:10,529
In bed or in the party?

28
00:06:12,445 --> 00:06:13,779
You see, Schmitz...

29
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,489
if I let you cheat me, tomorrow
someone else will cheat me.

30
00:06:17,572 --> 00:06:19,073
Soon they'll all cheat me.

31
00:06:19,198 --> 00:06:22,699
It's not about the 150.
It's a matter of principle.

32
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:26,449
It's about my very existence,
and for that I could be driven...

33
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,367
to take extreme measures.

34
00:06:30,785 --> 00:06:32,202
Sally, you old crook!

35
00:06:32,285 --> 00:06:34,619
Let me introduce
an old friend of mine!

36
00:06:34,743 --> 00:06:38,703
Sally Sorowitsch, the most
charming scoundrel in Berlin!

37
00:06:39,788 --> 00:06:40,913
Sorowitsch?

38
00:06:40,996 --> 00:06:42,372
Are you Russian?

39
00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:45,040
I hope you're not a Communist?

40
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:47,873
Enough of a Communist
to share my champagne with you.

41
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,375
Sally--that's a droll sort of name.

42
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,085
Where does it come from?

43
00:06:57,127 --> 00:06:58,627
It's short for Salomon.

44
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:01,962
Salomon?

45
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:10,547
She can spit the champagne back.
It's a Rothschild.

46
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:19,300
I'm trusting you.

47
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,636
What do they always say?
Don't do business with Jews!

48
00:07:29,471 --> 00:07:32,388
Trying so hard not to be noticed
gets you noticed.

49
00:07:32,471 --> 00:07:34,389
Not learnt that yet
in the Resistance?

50
00:07:34,472 --> 00:07:35,722
I'm sorry, Sally.

51
00:07:35,806 --> 00:07:38,890
- In two hours up at my place.
- OK, Sally.

52
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:52,395
You're leaving?

53
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:53,602
Tonight.

54
00:07:53,686 --> 00:07:56,146
Got a tip-off.
Been here too long.

55
00:08:05,065 --> 00:08:07,232
Crack the dollar
and you can do anything.

56
00:08:07,315 --> 00:08:10,401
It's not quite perfect.
But one of these days...

57
00:08:10,483 --> 00:08:12,651
Have you got the money?

58
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:16,485
That's what we wanted
to talk to you about.

59
00:08:18,153 --> 00:08:20,571
- They're our people.
- Our people?

60
00:08:20,654 --> 00:08:23,238
I'm me and the others
are the others.

61
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:28,239
Don't you see
what's going on around you?

62
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:30,240
What the Nazis are doing to us?

63
00:08:30,323 --> 00:08:32,991
Know why the Jews
are always persecuted?

64
00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:35,741
Because they refuse to adapt!
It's not that hard.

65
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:39,242
- Sally, don't you have any--
- No.

66
00:08:39,325 --> 00:08:40,909
Need a certificate of Aryan purity?

67
00:08:40,993 --> 00:08:44,078
I'll do one proving you descend
from Siegfried and the Dragon.

68
00:08:44,161 --> 00:08:45,412
Do you know Schiele?

69
00:08:46,412 --> 00:08:48,580
I even met him once,

70
00:08:48,663 --> 00:08:49,830
in Vienna.

71
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:51,122
A great master.

72
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,747
Your pictures.

73
00:08:54,748 --> 00:08:56,832
I don't believe
you're such an asshole.

74
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:06,252
Who'd have thought it?
Hans using beautiful women...

75
00:09:06,335 --> 00:09:08,420
Listen--

76
00:09:08,503 --> 00:09:10,837
The jewelry's
not even worth half.

77
00:09:12,338 --> 00:09:14,421
I need an Argentinean passport.

78
00:09:16,504 --> 00:09:19,590
- I've already packed.
- Hans, you can go.

79
00:09:21,673 --> 00:09:23,215
I'll settle this with Mr. Sorowitsch.

80
00:09:37,345 --> 00:09:38,762
You're lucky...

81
00:09:40,221 --> 00:09:42,264
wanting an Argentinean passport.

82
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:46,057
The home of tango.

83
00:10:35,031 --> 00:10:36,698
You could be a really great artist.

84
00:10:38,032 --> 00:10:39,698
What do you know about it?

85
00:10:40,866 --> 00:10:42,033
A great deal.

86
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:44,949
Otherwise I wouldn't have stayed.

87
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:49,285
Why earn money by making art?

88
00:10:50,368 --> 00:10:53,287
Earning money by making money
is far easier.

89
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,499
I have to go.

90
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:18,920
May I?

91
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:23,213
Friedrich Herzog, Berlin CID,
Counterfeit Squad.

92
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:26,297
It is a great honor

93
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,006
to arrest the world's
best counterfeiter,

94
00:11:30,048 --> 00:11:31,715
if that is any consolation.

95
00:11:35,217 --> 00:11:36,383
The dollar!

96
00:11:38,718 --> 00:11:40,551
Bitten off more
than we can chew, eh?

97
00:12:13,063 --> 00:12:14,562
Go on!

98
00:12:21,565 --> 00:12:23,316
Get up, you lazy Jewish bastard!

99
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,982
Get up, will you!

100
00:12:29,068 --> 00:12:31,069
You there!
Get rid of that vermin!

101
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:37,070
They're out to get us.

102
00:12:42,072 --> 00:12:43,906
This is no jail.

103
00:12:45,074 --> 00:12:46,323
They're going to kill us.

104
00:12:47,406 --> 00:12:49,573
They're out to get us.

105
00:12:51,908 --> 00:12:53,033
The Kapo:

106
00:12:53,116 --> 00:12:54,492
Melzer.

107
00:12:55,785 --> 00:12:57,118
Watch out for him.

108
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:00,285
A murderer.

109
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:04,995
The ones with the green triangle...

110
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:08,039
habitual criminals,
worse than the SS.

111
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,416
But you don't look like a--

112
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:26,003
If you touch me I'll cut your throat.

113
00:13:32,088 --> 00:13:35,129
I'll be watching you,
you filthy swine.

114
00:13:35,213 --> 00:13:37,297
I'll get you!

115
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,675
Are you crazy?
You can't just--

116
00:13:41,758 --> 00:13:43,175
He has to respect me,

117
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:45,509
but not lose face.

118
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,510
The same as in any other jail.

119
00:14:57,782 --> 00:14:58,949
On your feet!

120
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:09,494
Who did this?

121
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:26,126
Number 75517.

122
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,378
I like it.

123
00:15:40,296 --> 00:15:42,714
You've caught it well, Jew.

124
00:15:42,797 --> 00:15:45,172
- It would be better in color.
- What?

125
00:15:45,256 --> 00:15:49,382
It would be better in color,
Herr Unterscharführer.

126
00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:51,799
The sheen of the boots.

127
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:55,342
Drawn from memory.

128
00:16:17,308 --> 00:16:18,474
What's all this?

129
00:16:21,643 --> 00:16:24,351
Herr Hauptsturmführer, it's...

130
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,352
It's like this, I...

131
00:16:46,984 --> 00:16:49,027
FIVE YEARS LATER

132
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,487
Sorowitsch!

133
00:16:54,821 --> 00:16:55,946
Look at this.

134
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,905
I thought a Styrian jacket
would look good!

135
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:02,281
I can paint whatever you want,
Herr Sturmbannführer.

136
00:17:02,364 --> 00:17:05,282
You're being moved.
Sachsenhausen. Tomorrow.

137
00:17:07,658 --> 00:17:09,575
But the picture isn't finished.

138
00:17:09,658 --> 00:17:11,700
I have to finish the picture.

139
00:17:11,783 --> 00:17:14,410
So the maggot's afraid
of losing its bacon!

140
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:17,578
A dirty little Jew like you
can fix himself up anywhere!

141
00:17:50,172 --> 00:17:52,340
Stinks to high heaven, that Jew!

142
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,052
Food.

143
00:18:34,853 --> 00:18:37,771
I always admired
the Russian avant-garde.

144
00:18:37,854 --> 00:18:39,270
Kandinsky, Rodchenko!

145
00:18:39,354 --> 00:18:42,355
At the academy in Odessa
we had a professor called Lebed.

146
00:18:44,397 --> 00:18:46,940
In my time,
Lebed was a junior lecturer.

147
00:18:47,024 --> 00:18:50,191
You were at the academy?
You're Russian too?

148
00:18:51,232 --> 00:18:55,193
I don't like speaking Russian.
Reminds me of bad times.

149
00:18:56,777 --> 00:18:59,153
You prefer to speak German?

150
00:19:04,196 --> 00:19:06,071
I had a family.

151
00:19:09,364 --> 00:19:10,781
We used to say,

152
00:19:10,864 --> 00:19:15,449
Lebed and good art
is like a virgin and good...

153
00:19:15,532 --> 00:19:17,116
Fucking.

154
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,742
So you know that one too!

155
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:49,959
Number 75517.

156
00:19:50,043 --> 00:19:51,794
Salomon Sorowitsch.

157
00:19:54,712 --> 00:19:56,129
The King of Counterfeiters!

158
00:19:57,713 --> 00:20:01,297
SS Sturmbannführer Herzog.
Don't you remember? Herzog?

159
00:20:01,381 --> 00:20:03,465
CID Berlin, Counterfeit Squad.

160
00:20:04,882 --> 00:20:07,466
I arrested you!
It got me promoted!

161
00:20:11,217 --> 00:20:12,634
What size are you?

162
00:20:13,718 --> 00:20:14,885
48.

163
00:20:15,886 --> 00:20:17,844
- Shoe size?
- 42.

164
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,430
Welcome to Sachsenhausen!

165
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:32,431
Name, profession, size?

166
00:20:33,516 --> 00:20:34,974
Burger, printer.

167
00:20:35,058 --> 00:20:36,475
Collotype. 52.

168
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:38,976
More like 46/48 now.

169
00:20:40,602 --> 00:20:41,602
Shoe size?

170
00:20:41,686 --> 00:20:42,686
41.

171
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:43,894
No, thanks.

172
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:47,312
A non-smoker! As you wish.
Much healthier!

173
00:20:49,563 --> 00:20:50,980
Name, profession, size?

174
00:20:55,564 --> 00:20:57,148
Welcome to Sachsenhausen.

175
00:21:25,741 --> 00:21:28,575
We use a different tone
here in my domain

176
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:31,493
than in the camps
you've just come from.

177
00:21:31,576 --> 00:21:34,619
I'd like to regard you
as coworkers here.

178
00:21:34,703 --> 00:21:36,620
Together we're going to...

179
00:21:39,912 --> 00:21:41,080
Yes.

180
00:21:42,247 --> 00:21:44,872
The clothes are secondhand.

181
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:49,041
You can wear prison stripes
if you prefer.

182
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,167
After all,
stripes flatter the figure!

183
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,292
What's his name?

184
00:22:03,586 --> 00:22:05,129
What the hell was that for?

185
00:22:06,254 --> 00:22:08,922
A symbolic gesture--
to get us shot?

186
00:22:51,602 --> 00:22:52,769
My dear Jews...

187
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:57,688
today I bring you a specialist
of international standing,

188
00:22:57,771 --> 00:22:59,855
Salomon Sorowitsch.

189
00:22:59,938 --> 00:23:02,440
He will supervise
the retouching department!

190
00:23:06,108 --> 00:23:07,525
"Operation Bernhard."

191
00:23:08,608 --> 00:23:10,608
Counterfeit money
on a huge scale.

192
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:14,193
ID cards, documents, banknotes...

193
00:23:15,236 --> 00:23:17,945
all to the latest technical standards.

194
00:23:19,987 --> 00:23:23,195
I expect the newcomers will want
to freshen up and relax?

195
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:25,864
Our foreman here, dear old Atze,

196
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,448
will show you around.

197
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,532
I wish you every success!

198
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:40,285
Another fine speech by
Herr Sturmbannführer.

199
00:24:02,292 --> 00:24:03,459
Fine beds.

200
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,210
Why are they giving us
such fine beds?

201
00:24:12,295 --> 00:24:13,879
It's still a concentration camp.

202
00:24:18,131 --> 00:24:19,422
But the beds are soft.

203
00:24:21,298 --> 00:24:22,466
That's good.

204
00:24:45,139 --> 00:24:48,223
"Anny Ondra will only wash
with Sarinol."

205
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,394
I was a commercial photographer.

206
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:17,816
Quiet in here, isn't it?

207
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,651
One forgets what it's like.

208
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:25,320
Where are they all running to?

209
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:27,986
The shoe-testing squad.

210
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,987
They make the prisoners
run in a circle...

211
00:25:32,488 --> 00:25:33,905
to test the shoes.

212
00:25:33,988 --> 00:25:35,405
Test them? How?

213
00:25:35,489 --> 00:25:39,573
It's a punishment. The shoes are
too small, sandbags on their backs.

214
00:25:39,656 --> 00:25:40,823
Many of them die.

215
00:25:42,158 --> 00:25:43,742
Best not to even listen.

216
00:25:45,993 --> 00:25:47,577
Music!

217
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,911
Right lads, I'll show you
where you'll be working!

218
00:25:55,996 --> 00:25:58,747
We've got men here from all
different camps. All professional--

219
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:03,248
graphic artists, printers,
retouchers, copper engravers.

220
00:26:03,332 --> 00:26:05,416
Why are they using Jews
for the work?

221
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,249
I assume
they mean to kill us after the war.

222
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,583
To keep it under wraps.

223
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:12,917
A genuine platen press.
Worked with one before?

224
00:26:15,335 --> 00:26:18,419
Lazy bastards!
Faster, you idle riffraff!

225
00:26:18,503 --> 00:26:20,921
It's OK. He's Dr. Klinger,
our Kapo.

226
00:26:21,004 --> 00:26:23,337
The SS need to hear him
yelling at us.

227
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,257
The new arrivals?

228
00:26:34,841 --> 00:26:36,759
Dr. Klinger, internal medicine.

229
00:26:38,343 --> 00:26:40,260
Welcome to the Golden Cage.

230
00:26:40,344 --> 00:26:43,261
Come and see me
at once, young man.

231
00:26:43,345 --> 00:26:45,095
That foot looks bad...

232
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:46,762
really bad!

233
00:26:53,181 --> 00:26:56,432
I wept too, the first time
I saw a printing press again.

234
00:26:56,516 --> 00:26:57,765
Reminds you
you're a human being.

235
00:26:59,682 --> 00:27:01,767
Zilinski, darkroom.

236
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:04,101
Matti, show him the ropes.

237
00:27:05,685 --> 00:27:06,852
Karloff?

238
00:27:07,936 --> 00:27:11,937
Graphics section. Through there,
straight ahead. You can't miss it.

239
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,437
Us two beauties...

240
00:27:14,438 --> 00:27:16,022
are going to Quality Control.

241
00:27:24,024 --> 00:27:27,442
Dr. Viktor Hahn, Royal Prussian
Credit Bank, Hamburg.

242
00:27:28,485 --> 00:27:31,860
Mr. Sorowitsch will supervise
the retouching section.

243
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:34,860
You're also
from the financial sector?

244
00:27:37,362 --> 00:27:39,862
Our main problem is the paper.

245
00:27:39,946 --> 00:27:41,863
It has the wrong feel.

246
00:27:42,863 --> 00:27:46,948
The English paper has the same
structure as a kind of Turkish linen.

247
00:27:47,031 --> 00:27:50,033
We've experimented
with various chemicals,

248
00:27:50,116 --> 00:27:52,283
but the results
remain unsatisfactory.

249
00:27:54,784 --> 00:27:55,951
A green triangle?

250
00:27:56,034 --> 00:27:58,619
A habitual criminal, Herr Laube?

251
00:27:58,702 --> 00:28:00,994
Sorowitsch is--if one can say so--

252
00:28:01,078 --> 00:28:03,371
a "professional" counterfeiter.

253
00:28:03,454 --> 00:28:05,287
Till now the only criminals here

254
00:28:05,371 --> 00:28:08,497
were those wearing
Nazi uniforms, my good man.

255
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:14,750
So it besmirches your honor
having to work with a jailbird?

256
00:28:15,374 --> 00:28:17,791
If honor is all one has left!

257
00:28:17,874 --> 00:28:20,792
You'll have a hard time here.
And that's a promise.

258
00:28:24,544 --> 00:28:25,711
Fuck you.

259
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:38,132
A weekend off!

260
00:28:40,882 --> 00:28:42,466
And a shower on Sunday!

261
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,968
Fraternizing
with a common criminal?

262
00:28:45,051 --> 00:28:48,135
The true criminals
are the capitalist exploiters.

263
00:28:48,219 --> 00:28:50,802
They're the ones
who made Fascism possible.

264
00:28:50,885 --> 00:28:54,303
If a proletarian steals bread
to feed his children...

265
00:28:54,387 --> 00:28:56,763
That's not exactly what I did.

266
00:28:56,847 --> 00:28:59,305
You gave a comrade
your slice of bread.

267
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:01,638
That was solidarity.

268
00:29:01,721 --> 00:29:03,931
That was soup.

269
00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:06,307
A low number.

270
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:08,641
How did you survive
so long in Auschwitz?

271
00:29:10,225 --> 00:29:11,393
A good work detail.

272
00:29:13,892 --> 00:29:15,310
What about a game?

273
00:29:16,727 --> 00:29:19,478
- What are we playing for?
- For honor's sake.

274
00:29:21,396 --> 00:29:23,397
I win even when I don't cheat.

275
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,860
What are you doing,
you idle bastard?

276
00:29:40,943 --> 00:29:42,694
This isn't a rest home!

277
00:29:42,777 --> 00:29:45,153
You're here to work!
Understood?

278
00:29:45,237 --> 00:29:46,404
Holst!

279
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,404
Leave him be!

280
00:29:50,738 --> 00:29:54,739
Thinking can also be work, Holst!
Try it yourself sometime.

281
00:29:59,408 --> 00:30:01,492
All amateurs and idiots.

282
00:30:01,575 --> 00:30:04,493
Forget the circumstances
for a moment.

283
00:30:05,577 --> 00:30:08,495
It's just you and me.
The most perfect forgeries ever.

284
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:10,578
First the pound...

285
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:13,746
and then the dollar!

286
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:17,831
Men, machines, material--
whatever you need!

287
00:30:19,582 --> 00:30:21,331
You see, Sorowitsch...

288
00:30:22,582 --> 00:30:25,332
there are ways of surviving here.

289
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:27,917
I can't guarantee it
for the others, but for you...

290
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:31,419
if...

291
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:55,843
Gentlemen, can't you stop that
nigger music?

292
00:30:55,926 --> 00:30:58,177
As if there
weren't any German music!

293
00:30:59,177 --> 00:31:00,511
One more before bedtime.

294
00:31:00,595 --> 00:31:03,179
Why isn't God in Auschwitz?

295
00:31:03,263 --> 00:31:05,429
He didn't get through
the selection process!

296
00:31:10,431 --> 00:31:11,598
Kanada.

297
00:31:14,932 --> 00:31:16,099
The low number.

298
00:31:17,266 --> 00:31:19,766
I was in the Kanada work detail.

299
00:31:20,767 --> 00:31:23,019
We sorted the luggage
on the platform.

300
00:31:23,102 --> 00:31:25,269
We took the food in the bags

301
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:28,354
while the people it belonged to
were being gassed.

302
00:31:30,937 --> 00:31:32,897
One adapts or dies.

303
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,190
I can't go on like this.

304
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,025
We have it so good in here...

305
00:31:44,942 --> 00:31:46,317
while out there...

306
00:31:48,943 --> 00:31:50,527
My wife is still in Auschwitz.

307
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:56,945
I won't give the Nazis the pleasure
of being ashamed I'm still alive.

308
00:32:04,281 --> 00:32:08,366
All prisoners to remain
in their barracks!

309
00:32:12,118 --> 00:32:15,493
Allegedly not even the commandant
knows what we do in here!

310
00:32:15,577 --> 00:32:16,785
...will be shot immediately!

311
00:32:29,205 --> 00:32:32,291
...anything, as long as
we aren't put out here again.

312
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:34,291
Anything...

313
00:32:55,798 --> 00:32:57,299
What's the matter?

314
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,716
They're going to gas us!

315
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:02,384
We're too valuable,
they won't harm us.

316
00:33:02,468 --> 00:33:04,260
Come on, get undressed.

317
00:33:04,343 --> 00:33:05,510
Come on!

318
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,137
Burger!

319
00:33:11,636 --> 00:33:13,303
Can you hear me?
Are you hurt?

320
00:33:14,304 --> 00:33:15,804
Get up.

321
00:33:16,305 --> 00:33:17,972
- Leave him, Burger! Come here!
- Dr. KIinger!

322
00:33:22,514 --> 00:33:23,682
You there!

323
00:33:25,308 --> 00:33:26,725
What are you doing here?

324
00:33:28,976 --> 00:33:30,477
Did any of them speak to you?

325
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:32,727
Did anybody speak to you?

326
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,227
Number 64000.

327
00:33:34,311 --> 00:33:36,895
- I asked if anybody here spoke to you.
- He was lying on the...

328
00:33:36,978 --> 00:33:39,063
Shut your face.
Did he speak to you?

329
00:33:39,146 --> 00:33:41,563
- I don't know him.
- What did he say?

330
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:44,065
God, are you dumb!
You come with me.

331
00:33:47,815 --> 00:33:49,566
What did you say to him?

332
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:53,567
It's forbidden to speak
to other prisoners.

333
00:33:58,485 --> 00:34:02,903
Mr. Burger
is our only collotype expert.

334
00:34:02,986 --> 00:34:04,904
He didn't speak to him either.

335
00:34:07,988 --> 00:34:09,155
Go and shower.

336
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:14,658
Go and shower!

337
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,243
I just wanted to help him.

338
00:34:34,789 --> 00:34:37,456
Move!

339
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:43,916
They're going to gas us.
Gas... I can smell it.

340
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,334
Water! It's water!

341
00:35:23,596 --> 00:35:24,763
Odessa?

342
00:35:26,014 --> 00:35:27,305
For you!

343
00:35:28,347 --> 00:35:30,974
Please excuse,
about today in shower.

344
00:35:31,057 --> 00:35:33,266
Reminds me a bit of Lukanov.

345
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:36,267
Yes.

346
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:38,184
Do you know his city views?

347
00:35:39,184 --> 00:35:41,936
Colors!
A pity there are no colors here.

348
00:35:42,019 --> 00:35:44,603
For me Odessa is blue, dark blue!

349
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:50,271
In the academy they said
my style is bad.

350
00:35:50,355 --> 00:35:53,356
But it's my art.
Even if it only pleases me.

351
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,447
Let me have a look.

352
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:23,365
I can do better than that.

353
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,866
Let me try again.

354
00:36:30,743 --> 00:36:31,910
Number 93--

355
00:36:33,661 --> 00:36:35,786
Have you settled in yet?

356
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:37,286
Got everything you need?

357
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:40,622
The ID cards we're supposed
to produce--

358
00:36:40,706 --> 00:36:42,788
the problem's
the cover and the paper.

359
00:36:42,871 --> 00:36:46,080
If we could have used originals...

360
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:49,374
You must now devote
all your efforts to the pound!

361
00:36:50,457 --> 00:36:52,959
It's important
we get results soon.

362
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:54,876
Himmler is growing impatient.

363
00:36:58,168 --> 00:36:59,335
What's this?

364
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,044
My 5-year-old could do better!

365
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,630
I'm a rail track layer.

366
00:37:08,714 --> 00:37:11,798
I said I was a printer
to get out of Sobibor.

367
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:14,632
They couldn't translate
my ID card. Help me!

368
00:37:17,551 --> 00:37:21,135
Paracystosis,
a material defect in the copper.

369
00:37:21,218 --> 00:37:23,802
Loszek is a specialist
in relief printing.

370
00:37:23,884 --> 00:37:26,969
He could be transferred
to the ID card section.

371
00:37:28,053 --> 00:37:29,721
Paracystosis.

372
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:36,639
Or we could have him shot.

373
00:37:40,474 --> 00:37:41,182
Beat it!

374
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:52,061
Never try to deceive me again,
Sorowitsch.

375
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,562
We're on the same side now.

376
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,581
Is this some
of the Turkish linen?

377
00:38:55,581 --> 00:38:57,957
Yes. I thought--

378
00:38:59,207 --> 00:39:00,375
Throw that away.

379
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,834
Rags!

380
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:06,002
The English use rags!

381
00:39:06,085 --> 00:39:08,586
Fibers, torn and abraded
thousands of times!

382
00:39:45,264 --> 00:39:48,515
Hardly any of the English
use wallets.

383
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:52,184
They pin the notes together
with safety pins.

384
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:56,185
That's why we're making
the little holes here at the edges.

385
00:40:00,269 --> 00:40:01,644
Negative retouching.

386
00:40:33,613 --> 00:40:38,698
It's not just a matter of slipping
a few notes past a shop assistant.

387
00:40:40,616 --> 00:40:43,700
We intend to flood and destroy
Britain's economy.

388
00:40:46,284 --> 00:40:49,202
If they realize we're using
forged notes...

389
00:40:50,787 --> 00:40:52,537
that'll be the end of the operation.

390
00:40:53,454 --> 00:40:55,119
We'd have to send you back...

391
00:40:56,453 --> 00:40:58,162
to the camps.

392
00:41:15,252 --> 00:41:17,377
She wasn't wearing any knickers!

393
00:41:17,461 --> 00:41:21,337
Just imagine, a photo shoot with
an agent, producer, and everything,

394
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,047
and that hot little tart
with no knickers! Skirt like this.

395
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:27,715
"Doesn't the gentleman
want to take another shot?"

396
00:41:28,798 --> 00:41:31,715
"Sure. I won't even need a tripod."

397
00:41:33,674 --> 00:41:35,051
You're standing in the sun.

398
00:41:42,802 --> 00:41:44,552
If we fail to bring off the pound...

399
00:41:45,804 --> 00:41:47,387
we should organize ourselves!

400
00:41:49,305 --> 00:41:50,555
There's a lot of us.

401
00:41:51,138 --> 00:41:54,139
We're well nourished,
we're strong, we could fight!

402
00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:56,390
We've got tools.

403
00:41:56,474 --> 00:41:58,058
With retouching knives?

404
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,059
Against an SS company?

405
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:03,975
Rather than let them gas us!

406
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:10,521
I'd rather be gassed tomorrow
than shot for nothing today.

407
00:42:10,604 --> 00:42:11,938
A day is a day.

408
00:42:13,771 --> 00:42:16,772
A revolt would at least be a sign!

409
00:42:21,148 --> 00:42:22,315
Zilinski's right.

410
00:42:23,982 --> 00:42:25,232
You're standing in the sun.

411
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,070
Kolya?

412
00:42:37,153 --> 00:42:38,737
When did the fever start?

413
00:42:40,488 --> 00:42:42,572
Sometimes fever is bad.

414
00:42:42,655 --> 00:42:44,240
In between, it's OK.

415
00:42:46,116 --> 00:42:50,074
We've had TB cases here before.
I asked for drugs, and...

416
00:42:50,157 --> 00:42:51,908
Kleinfeld, Stiasny, Jilovsky.

417
00:42:51,991 --> 00:42:54,701
All shot, because of
the risk of infection.

418
00:42:54,785 --> 00:42:56,202
Can you help him?

419
00:42:56,285 --> 00:42:57,828
I'll see what I...

420
00:42:58,828 --> 00:43:00,328
Without the right drugs...

421
00:43:02,327 --> 00:43:03,495
Isolate him.

422
00:43:06,996 --> 00:43:08,580
I'm a doctor--

423
00:43:08,664 --> 00:43:09,831
internal medicine!

424
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:15,707
Bad sickness?

425
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:17,250
No, no.

426
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:19,917
The doctor will make it better.

427
00:43:21,959 --> 00:43:25,086
I have to live to see
when the camp is over.

428
00:43:28,003 --> 00:43:29,170
Exactly!

429
00:43:49,009 --> 00:43:50,260
Bring some dressings, fast!

430
00:43:56,512 --> 00:43:59,429
Those original documents
you asked for.

431
00:43:59,513 --> 00:44:01,430
The crates came from Auschwitz.

432
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:03,932
Loszek found
his children's passports.

433
00:44:09,517 --> 00:44:11,184
This is pointless!

434
00:44:13,935 --> 00:44:15,060
You have to survive.

435
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:19,436
Only by surviving
can we defeat them!

436
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,437
You have to survive!

437
00:44:22,521 --> 00:44:24,021
Loszek, you must survive!

438
00:44:33,149 --> 00:44:34,732
Wake up!

439
00:44:34,816 --> 00:44:36,275
Assemble for roll call outside!

440
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:38,025
Filthy Jewish scum!

441
00:44:40,818 --> 00:44:42,068
Outside!

442
00:44:48,946 --> 00:44:50,572
Get out!

443
00:45:05,535 --> 00:45:09,286
Sorry to wake you,
but I have a story to tell.

444
00:45:10,369 --> 00:45:13,579
A few days ago, a businessman
went into a bank in Zurich.

445
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,580
He was carrying a small case...

446
00:45:17,163 --> 00:45:18,330
full of money.

447
00:45:20,373 --> 00:45:21,790
Pound notes.

448
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:32,127
Our agent asks to open an account
with his British pounds.

449
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:33,502
Of course, Monsieur.

450
00:45:34,503 --> 00:45:37,420
But you must understand,
for reasons of security,

451
00:45:37,503 --> 00:45:40,462
we have to check
the authenticity of these notes.

452
00:45:40,546 --> 00:45:41,755
But of course!

453
00:45:42,755 --> 00:45:44,464
In times like these...

454
00:45:47,841 --> 00:45:49,966
For half an hour,

455
00:45:50,049 --> 00:45:53,258
Swiss bank experts scrutinized
our little printed products,

456
00:45:53,341 --> 00:45:55,134
with a vengeance.

457
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,929
Your bank notes.

458
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,972
Our examination has confirmed

459
00:46:09,055 --> 00:46:11,764
that as far as we can tell...

460
00:46:12,347 --> 00:46:14,974
they are...

461
00:46:15,557 --> 00:46:17,892
genuine!

462
00:46:22,144 --> 00:46:23,643
Wait, it's not over yet.

463
00:46:23,727 --> 00:46:25,811
Our agent gets cocky!

464
00:46:25,895 --> 00:46:27,228
Monsieur le Directeur...

465
00:46:28,228 --> 00:46:29,979
since I received these notes

466
00:46:30,062 --> 00:46:34,146
from an admittedly
rather dubious source...

467
00:46:35,229 --> 00:46:37,981
I'd prefer to have
absolute certainty.

468
00:46:38,064 --> 00:46:40,690
Our bank
will accept your money.

469
00:46:40,773 --> 00:46:43,650
- There is no need--
- Absolute certainty, Monsieur.

470
00:46:44,734 --> 00:46:46,650
If you insist,

471
00:46:46,734 --> 00:46:50,652
then I suggest we have the notes
checked by the Bank of England.

472
00:46:50,736 --> 00:46:52,819
The Bank of England!

473
00:46:52,903 --> 00:46:55,321
Let's see what they have
to carp about.

474
00:46:55,404 --> 00:46:57,070
Maybe we'll get a few tips.

475
00:47:01,573 --> 00:47:03,823
"After thorough examination,
we conclude

476
00:47:03,907 --> 00:47:06,991
"that the bank notes
submitted by you

477
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,742
"in denominations of £5,

478
00:47:08,824 --> 00:47:11,951
"£10, and £20 sterling...

479
00:47:13,035 --> 00:47:15,785
"are not forgeries.

480
00:47:16,869 --> 00:47:20,661
The Bank of England herewith
guarantees their authenticity."

481
00:47:27,414 --> 00:47:30,498
Reichsführer SS Himmler
is very pleased with our efforts.

482
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:34,499
These duds are so perfect
our plans have changed.

483
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:36,834
They're too good to be
simply dropped over England.

484
00:47:36,918 --> 00:47:42,169
The German Reich will use them
for its long-term currency dealings!

485
00:47:43,002 --> 00:47:46,420
And in turn
this gave me the idea...

486
00:47:47,421 --> 00:47:49,505
of giving you a little pleasure.

487
00:47:51,089 --> 00:47:52,882
As an incentive, so to speak.

488
00:48:05,426 --> 00:48:06,676
I thought perhaps...

489
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,011
after work, or...

490
00:48:11,261 --> 00:48:12,720
at the weekend?

491
00:48:15,764 --> 00:48:20,181
On behalf of all the men, I'd like
to thank you for all our privileges.

492
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:22,515
Motivation, Klinger, motivation!

493
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,184
I'm interested in managing people;
that's where the future lies.

494
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,768
If you treat people like dirt,
they won't work.

495
00:48:30,851 --> 00:48:33,269
And if you treat dirt like people...

496
00:48:36,938 --> 00:48:40,354
You Jews--tricks and fakery,
that's what you're good at.

497
00:48:40,437 --> 00:48:44,064
If one scratches just a bit
at that respectable façade...

498
00:48:44,939 --> 00:48:46,439
Herr Sturmbannführer.

499
00:48:47,941 --> 00:48:50,357
All my life I've been
an upright citizen.

500
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,857
I must point out that

501
00:48:51,941 --> 00:48:55,359
here I am being coerced
into performing dishonest acts.

502
00:49:09,031 --> 00:49:10,531
Excellent work, Sorowitsch.

503
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:13,365
Set up a new working group
for the dollar!

504
00:49:42,291 --> 00:49:43,875
Can't anyone see
what's happening?

505
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,377
The Germans are bankrupt.

506
00:49:47,459 --> 00:49:50,044
No foreign currency means
no gasoline, no raw materials.

507
00:49:50,127 --> 00:49:53,295
- We're financing the Nazi war effort!
- So?

508
00:49:54,295 --> 00:49:57,130
Are you suggesting sabotage?
In a concentration camp?

509
00:50:40,978 --> 00:50:44,395
The Americans use rotogravure,
we're using collotype...

510
00:50:44,478 --> 00:50:47,311
in order to produce
large amounts quickly.

511
00:50:48,396 --> 00:50:50,646
Collotype is good for definition
and halftones.

512
00:50:51,647 --> 00:50:56,231
There are still some problems,
but we're dealing with them.

513
00:50:56,314 --> 00:50:59,899
Thankfully we have
an expert in this field.

514
00:51:03,276 --> 00:51:05,193
A score to settle with the dollar?

515
00:51:05,277 --> 00:51:07,735
You know it was the dollars
that led to your arrest.

516
00:51:07,819 --> 00:51:10,152
Back then, I didn't have
the technical means.

517
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,654
And now?

518
00:51:13,488 --> 00:51:14,989
How much do you need?

519
00:51:17,488 --> 00:51:18,739
Maybe a few hundred million.

520
00:51:25,826 --> 00:51:27,493
You cheap whore!

521
00:51:28,534 --> 00:51:31,742
Just be thankful you're in here,
you idiot!

522
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:41,162
Shit, shit, shit!

523
00:51:58,168 --> 00:52:01,254
Maybe it's not the negative
but your gelatin.

524
00:52:07,338 --> 00:52:09,589
Sorowitsch's negative
was perfect, as always.

525
00:52:13,673 --> 00:52:14,840
But why...?

526
00:52:20,676 --> 00:52:25,093
My wife and I were sent to Auschwitz
for printing anti-Nazi flyers.

527
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:29,595
I'm not going to print money
for the Nazis.

528
00:52:37,514 --> 00:52:38,682
Look...

529
00:52:39,515 --> 00:52:41,433
my family, small business...

530
00:52:41,516 --> 00:52:46,435
always careful, never any
problems with the authorities.

531
00:52:46,518 --> 00:52:49,601
Kept my nose out of politics.

532
00:52:49,685 --> 00:52:51,686
Gisela, my wife, always said...

533
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:55,687
the reason we're printers
is to print the truth!

534
00:52:56,687 --> 00:52:58,688
Where did you learn that slogan?

535
00:52:59,229 --> 00:53:02,689
The Communist Printers' League,
youth section?

536
00:53:06,691 --> 00:53:10,109
If we print millions of dollars,
it could decide the war.

537
00:53:10,191 --> 00:53:12,359
We could contribute to fighting
the Nazis here...

538
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,902
that wouldn't be
just a symbolic gesture!

539
00:53:15,986 --> 00:53:17,777
We're alive.

540
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:20,195
- That's worth a hell of a lot.
- Exactly.

541
00:53:20,279 --> 00:53:22,779
Isn't it about more
than your own shitty little life?

542
00:53:22,863 --> 00:53:25,572
Our shitty life
is the only thing we have.

543
00:53:25,655 --> 00:53:30,158
Is this about surviving, or proving
that you can forge the dollar?

544
00:53:36,116 --> 00:53:38,117
I'll keep on
destroying your negatives.

545
00:53:39,701 --> 00:53:41,618
You can squeal to Herzog
if you want.

546
00:53:44,869 --> 00:53:48,078
We'll have to pay for it
if we don't deliver!

547
00:53:48,162 --> 00:53:51,538
All of us will pay!

548
00:53:53,873 --> 00:53:55,040
Yes.

549
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,464
Warsaw!

550
00:54:20,547 --> 00:54:22,340
The bastards
are being driven back!

551
00:54:38,679 --> 00:54:39,846
Carry on!

552
00:54:43,722 --> 00:54:46,556
So you're failing with the dollar?

553
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,308
We're still having problems
with the gelatin,

554
00:54:50,391 --> 00:54:51,975
Herr Hauptscharführer.

555
00:54:52,391 --> 00:54:54,309
We can do the pound
without you now.

556
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:57,894
And you know what you are
without the dollar?

557
00:54:57,977 --> 00:55:00,644
Nothing but criminal
Jewish scum.

558
00:55:02,728 --> 00:55:06,145
Fuck Herzog and his "motivation."

559
00:55:09,064 --> 00:55:11,647
I'd soon make you knuckle under.

560
00:55:27,736 --> 00:55:29,320
You're such filthy swine.

561
00:55:30,404 --> 00:55:32,572
Stoop to anything
to save your wretched lives.

562
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:36,074
Nauseating.

563
00:56:19,253 --> 00:56:20,421
Plappler.

564
00:56:21,088 --> 00:56:24,587
Get Hotte. A basin's broken--
maybe he can repair it.

565
00:56:42,761 --> 00:56:47,261
I saved all our butts
by forging the pound for the Nazis.

566
00:57:00,266 --> 00:57:03,184
Dr. Klinger said you must eat well.

567
00:57:03,267 --> 00:57:04,435
What for?

568
00:57:08,102 --> 00:57:10,519
One for the Expressionists.

569
00:57:10,602 --> 00:57:13,354
One for the Avant-garde.

570
00:57:13,437 --> 00:57:15,188
Eat, or I'll flatten you.

571
00:57:20,106 --> 00:57:22,190
You certainly know
how to bring up children.

572
00:57:29,943 --> 00:57:31,526
What happened to your family?

573
00:57:36,445 --> 00:57:38,862
Deported, killed?

574
00:57:42,279 --> 00:57:45,198
I could've bought their release,
if I'd had money.

575
00:58:03,121 --> 00:58:06,121
14 to 6. Burger to serve.

576
00:58:16,749 --> 00:58:17,916
Get up!

577
00:58:20,042 --> 00:58:21,418
Keep running!

578
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:28,628
What's going on?

579
00:58:28,711 --> 00:58:30,920
Herr Rottenführer,
I was about to--

580
00:58:31,003 --> 00:58:32,796
What are you waiting for?

581
00:58:33,796 --> 00:58:37,297
No, please not...!

582
00:58:47,135 --> 00:58:50,301
Are you crazy, soldier?

583
00:58:50,385 --> 00:58:52,386
Stand at attention!

584
00:58:52,469 --> 00:58:53,761
Your name, cretin?

585
00:58:53,845 --> 00:58:55,720
Rottenführer Wegener,
Herr Hauptscharführer.

586
00:58:57,471 --> 00:58:59,222
Why are you shooting here?

587
00:58:59,305 --> 00:59:02,973
What if you'd hit one of my Jews?

588
00:59:06,307 --> 00:59:07,474
Play!

589
00:59:08,976 --> 00:59:10,351
15 to 6.

590
00:59:14,809 --> 00:59:17,894
It's a concentration camp.
Dozens are murdered here every day.

591
00:59:17,977 --> 00:59:19,478
Let's just stop up our ears!

592
00:59:22,146 --> 00:59:23,312
16 to 6.

593
00:59:29,982 --> 00:59:31,315
One of thousands.

594
00:59:32,482 --> 00:59:35,400
Just be thankful we're
on this side of the wall, Sally.

595
00:59:44,154 --> 00:59:47,195
Look at that!

596
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:05,535
If you don't survive here
why survive at all?

597
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:36,003
Atze has just told me why we still have
no results after so many months.

598
01:00:36,545 --> 01:00:39,753
The gelatin, Herr Sturmbannführer.
It melts.

599
01:00:39,837 --> 01:00:41,005
Oh, yes!

600
01:00:43,171 --> 01:00:45,672
I've already heard that lie
from the other Jew there.

601
01:00:55,508 --> 01:00:57,260
Are you trying to sabotage?

602
01:01:02,678 --> 01:01:04,387
- We're doing everything--
- Hold your tongue!

603
01:01:04,471 --> 01:01:06,637
Don't think you're irreplaceable!

604
01:01:13,016 --> 01:01:14,183
Right.

605
01:01:15,349 --> 01:01:17,099
Berlin is demanding the dollar.

606
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:19,476
Those five there.

607
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:21,058
Klinger, take down their names!

608
01:01:21,142 --> 01:01:23,101
If there's no dollar in four weeks,

609
01:01:23,185 --> 01:01:26,102
those five will be shot
and five others selected.

610
01:01:26,186 --> 01:01:28,103
Not Sorowitsch, that one.

611
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,271
Don't believe
I can't dispense with you.

612
01:01:35,189 --> 01:01:36,355
By the way, Klinger.

613
01:01:40,023 --> 01:01:42,774
It's Carnival time!
What about having an evening's fun,

614
01:01:42,858 --> 01:01:46,276
with music, dancing,
cabaret, a knees-up!

615
01:01:46,359 --> 01:01:48,694
I'm sure a few talented men
can be found!

616
01:01:50,527 --> 01:01:51,944
Herr Sturmbannführer!

617
01:01:52,028 --> 01:01:55,196
I've always done my best.

618
01:02:05,531 --> 01:02:09,283
He won't kill anyone. He's got to deliver,
so he's blackmailing us.

619
01:02:09,366 --> 01:02:12,743
- What would you do in his position?
- Me in his position?

620
01:02:12,826 --> 01:02:15,118
I'd never be in the position
of an SS criminal.

621
01:02:38,376 --> 01:02:39,543
It's Burger.

622
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:42,628
I suspect he's deliberately...

623
01:02:44,377 --> 01:02:45,961
Yesterday I saw him...

624
01:02:46,045 --> 01:02:48,629
- He's sabotaging them. I know.
- What?

625
01:02:50,379 --> 01:02:52,422
But if he doesn't stop...

626
01:02:58,549 --> 01:03:00,132
Herzog saved our lives.

627
01:03:00,216 --> 01:03:01,633
He plays fair.

628
01:03:01,716 --> 01:03:05,968
- One can talk to him.
- You'll hold your tongue, Zilinski.

629
01:03:06,052 --> 01:03:08,969
- One doesn't betray one's mates.
- Mates?

630
01:03:09,053 --> 01:03:12,303
We're to die for the ideals
of that shitty political ideologue?

631
01:03:15,388 --> 01:03:16,972
Sit down.

632
01:03:18,556 --> 01:03:20,057
Burger the hero!

633
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:24,849
He's always determined
to play the martyr.

634
01:03:24,933 --> 01:03:26,849
That's fine for him,
but not with me!

635
01:03:30,226 --> 01:03:32,976
I lost four toes to frostbite
in Buchenwald.

636
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:35,144
They broke my back in Dachau.

637
01:03:35,227 --> 01:03:37,978
More than once
I nearly died of starvation.

638
01:03:38,062 --> 01:03:41,104
I deserve to survive this too!

639
01:03:41,188 --> 01:03:43,731
One never squeals on one's mates.

640
01:03:45,064 --> 01:03:46,231
Never!

641
01:03:46,814 --> 01:03:48,315
What's this?

642
01:03:49,398 --> 01:03:50,900
Jailbirds' honor?

643
01:03:58,902 --> 01:04:01,237
If you betray him, I'll kill you.

644
01:04:17,075 --> 01:04:19,824
We've delayed the dollar by months.

645
01:04:19,908 --> 01:04:21,825
You've had your fun.

646
01:04:21,909 --> 01:04:24,827
But now our mates' lives
are at stake.

647
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:26,161
You can't just...

648
01:04:30,203 --> 01:04:31,204
Gisela...

649
01:04:32,996 --> 01:04:34,163
my wife.

650
01:04:38,415 --> 01:04:39,958
She was in Auschwitz too.

651
01:04:42,416 --> 01:04:43,750
Shot trying to escape.

652
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:46,334
I'm...

653
01:04:47,752 --> 01:04:48,919
You're sorry?

654
01:04:54,086 --> 01:04:55,253
Thanks.

655
01:05:05,923 --> 01:05:07,007
But now it's the dollar!

656
01:05:10,259 --> 01:05:11,425
We have to go on.

657
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:14,926
It's a matter of...

658
01:05:15,593 --> 01:05:17,511
our comfortable life here.

659
01:05:17,594 --> 01:05:19,804
Of these fine beds.
These fine...

660
01:05:19,886 --> 01:05:21,596
soft beds!

661
01:05:41,601 --> 01:05:43,394
I thought I'd be able to cry.

662
01:05:59,108 --> 01:06:00,441
Serious but stable.

663
01:06:01,441 --> 01:06:03,192
A race against time.

664
01:06:03,276 --> 01:06:05,026
But without medication...

665
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:06,527
What do you need?

666
01:06:08,611 --> 01:06:11,195
- But how...?
- The drugs!

667
01:06:13,612 --> 01:06:15,113
In Theresienstadt...

668
01:06:16,113 --> 01:06:17,697
there were never enough drugs.

669
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:22,198
I had to decide...

670
01:06:23,282 --> 01:06:24,615
who was healed...

671
01:06:26,283 --> 01:06:27,866
and who died.

672
01:06:34,286 --> 01:06:37,245
Herzog's a crook.
I know how to handle him.

673
01:06:48,249 --> 01:06:50,125
Need an invitation, or what?

674
01:07:13,464 --> 01:07:15,465
How nice that you could come!

675
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,050
For goodness' sake
take the handcuffs off him.

676
01:07:21,634 --> 01:07:22,801
Chilly, isn't it?

677
01:07:29,221 --> 01:07:33,638
How I wish certain East Coast circles
in America could see you!

678
01:07:33,722 --> 01:07:36,181
You've no idea
of the dreadful propaganda

679
01:07:36,265 --> 01:07:38,057
being circulated about the camps!

680
01:07:38,807 --> 01:07:41,182
Friedrich, do pour Herr Soritsch
another cup of tea!

681
01:07:42,265 --> 01:07:45,558
Do you take candy sugar--
as a Jew?

682
01:07:45,641 --> 01:07:48,560
Friedrich told me you were
a dangerous criminal...

683
01:07:48,643 --> 01:07:49,768
and now?

684
01:07:49,852 --> 01:07:51,894
Serving a noble cause!

685
01:07:51,978 --> 01:07:54,311
I don't understand anything
about politics, but...!

686
01:07:54,811 --> 01:07:56,270
Now, children...

687
01:07:56,353 --> 01:07:59,272
we must leave Daddy
and his visitor alone.

688
01:08:06,149 --> 01:08:07,816
Leni, Lotte...

689
01:08:08,858 --> 01:08:09,900
and little Friedrich.

690
01:08:11,818 --> 01:08:13,068
Bringing up children...

691
01:08:15,652 --> 01:08:18,236
making responsible individuals
of them,

692
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,737
who take charge of their lives.

693
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:23,070
I don't hit my children.

694
01:08:23,154 --> 01:08:24,571
Ever.

695
01:08:24,654 --> 01:08:26,072
Words are enough...

696
01:08:27,488 --> 01:08:29,406
and setting
a good example oneself.

697
01:08:30,656 --> 01:08:32,240
That's what counts, Sorowitsch.

698
01:08:38,326 --> 01:08:40,409
After all, who knows
what the future will bring?

699
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:45,579
If the Russians come...

700
01:08:47,163 --> 01:08:50,747
one will just have to fight anew
for one's place in society.

701
01:08:52,372 --> 01:08:53,539
Do you know...

702
01:08:53,998 --> 01:08:57,791
I used to be--a long,
long time ago--a Communist.

703
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,751
Liberty, equality, human rights--

704
01:09:02,834 --> 01:09:04,251
the whole caboodle!

705
01:09:04,335 --> 01:09:06,668
And don't get the idea
that I'm a Nazi!

706
01:09:06,752 --> 01:09:08,252
No, no.

707
01:09:09,252 --> 01:09:11,170
No more grand ideals.

708
01:09:12,171 --> 01:09:14,420
I do my work where I'm needed.

709
01:09:14,503 --> 01:09:15,588
Do you understand?

710
01:09:16,588 --> 01:09:18,589
Everyone has to look out
for himself.

711
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,257
You must produce the dollar!

712
01:09:24,674 --> 01:09:26,549
Any longer and I can't--

713
01:09:27,842 --> 01:09:31,968
I know about the sabotage.
I know you won't betray your friends.

714
01:09:32,052 --> 01:09:33,386
But I must deliver the goods.

715
01:09:34,386 --> 01:09:35,844
Whatever the price.

716
01:09:56,684 --> 01:09:58,018
Who's it for?

717
01:10:01,019 --> 01:10:02,478
And then I get the dollar?

718
01:10:04,687 --> 01:10:05,979
You Jews!

719
01:10:06,063 --> 01:10:08,897
You'd even bargain
with a comrade's life!

720
01:10:15,524 --> 01:10:18,108
By the way, that Burger--

721
01:10:18,192 --> 01:10:19,942
Absolutely trustworthy.

722
01:10:20,026 --> 01:10:21,817
Collotype.
Our most important man.

723
01:10:36,364 --> 01:10:38,114
Only six days left.
Will you do the dollar?

724
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:44,616
Leibowitz is a rotogravure printer.
Show him how, so you don't have to--

725
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:45,867
No, Zilinski.

726
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,868
We have a responsibility

727
01:10:47,951 --> 01:10:50,452
towards our families
and our comrades...

728
01:10:50,535 --> 01:10:54,953
- because we've got it so good.
- I can't listen to this crap any longer!

729
01:10:57,704 --> 01:11:00,414
So you decide
that we get ourselves shot?

730
01:11:00,497 --> 01:11:01,790
It's the principle.

731
01:11:01,873 --> 01:11:04,624
Nobody's prepared
to die for a principle.

732
01:11:04,707 --> 01:11:06,832
That's why the Nazis'
system works!

733
01:11:11,917 --> 01:11:15,502
You will do the fucking dollar!

734
01:12:53,575 --> 01:12:54,742
Well...

735
01:12:55,743 --> 01:12:59,327
let's see what progress
has been made.

736
01:13:06,247 --> 01:13:07,497
Herr Sturmbannführer...

737
01:13:09,081 --> 01:13:11,498
we're still having problems
with the gelatin.

738
01:13:12,915 --> 01:13:16,208
Herr Sturmbannführer,
no, it's like this.

739
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:17,458
Burger...

740
01:13:26,752 --> 01:13:29,170
See if you can tell
which are the genuine ones.

741
01:13:42,591 --> 01:13:44,091
The dollar!

742
01:13:45,092 --> 01:13:46,259
That is brilliant!

743
01:13:47,009 --> 01:13:48,427
Your masterpiece!

744
01:13:50,761 --> 01:13:55,429
Using collotype we could produce
a million a week?

745
01:13:58,388 --> 01:14:00,847
Now that is a nice surprise
for Carnival!

746
01:14:18,769 --> 01:14:21,270
I knew you could be relied upon!

747
01:14:33,691 --> 01:14:35,525
Ladies and gentlemen,

748
01:14:35,608 --> 01:14:42,401
let me give you a very warm welcome
to our 1945 Carnival Show.

749
01:14:42,943 --> 01:14:46,153
From the world's
most expensive stage!

750
01:15:23,624 --> 01:15:26,207
Try not to cough
when Herzog's around.

751
01:15:57,635 --> 01:15:59,927
You always wanted colors!

752
01:16:30,729 --> 01:16:32,105
Listen...

753
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:38,815
here's another one...

754
01:16:39,899 --> 01:16:44,443
you've not heard this one yet.

755
01:16:44,526 --> 01:16:47,485
A nun goes to the gynecologist
with a hamster...

756
01:16:48,027 --> 01:16:50,943
Wait, I haven't finished yet!

757
01:16:52,444 --> 01:16:55,653
That you all owe your lives to me,
for getting you out of...

758
01:16:56,653 --> 01:16:58,821
- Auschwitz, Mauthausen...
- The drugs?

759
01:17:03,656 --> 01:17:06,073
Name, place of birth, in capitals.

760
01:17:06,157 --> 01:17:08,991
SWISS PASSPORT

761
01:17:13,159 --> 01:17:15,368
Put "Jew" as well,
to be on the safe side.

762
01:17:17,828 --> 01:17:20,495
You should take care
you don't get infected.

763
01:17:21,995 --> 01:17:26,289
Ultimately, your survival
is what it's all about!

764
01:17:33,499 --> 01:17:34,999
These are difficult times.

765
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:38,167
It's no longer easy for me either.

766
01:17:56,507 --> 01:17:57,590
Wonderful!

767
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:00,926
This will give us a chance.

768
01:18:02,176 --> 01:18:03,510
Where's Kolya?

769
01:18:38,937 --> 01:18:40,479
How old are you?

770
01:18:42,355 --> 01:18:43,523
Twenty.

771
01:18:44,523 --> 01:18:45,856
And where are you from?

772
01:18:46,857 --> 01:18:48,024
Odessa.

773
01:18:49,399 --> 01:18:51,441
The Black Sea, how lovely.

774
01:18:52,525 --> 01:18:53,692
Kneel down.

775
01:19:30,037 --> 01:19:31,788
Karloff had TB,

776
01:19:31,871 --> 01:19:34,956
a very dangerous,
infectious disease.

777
01:19:35,038 --> 01:19:38,122
He was endangering
the health of you all,

778
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:40,290
so I had to shoot him.

779
01:19:40,873 --> 01:19:43,542
For your own good, lads!

780
01:19:44,542 --> 01:19:46,708
We smoked a cigarette together.

781
01:19:47,875 --> 01:19:50,293
He knew
what was going to happen.

782
01:19:50,377 --> 01:19:53,795
I tell you,
he was really brave.

783
01:19:53,878 --> 01:19:55,003
A Jew...

784
01:19:55,087 --> 01:19:57,380
but he died like a man!

785
01:19:59,380 --> 01:20:01,797
But now, let's forget about it!

786
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,799
Sturmbannführer Herzog
has had to leave,

787
01:20:04,882 --> 01:20:07,967
but he left me these to give you.

788
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:10,384
So let's thank him for that
with three cheers!

789
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:18,387
Carry on as you were!

790
01:21:41,454 --> 01:21:43,163
Stop work!

791
01:21:43,247 --> 01:21:46,289
Stop work immediately!
Dismantle the machines!

792
01:21:48,874 --> 01:21:51,499
The Exakt platen press,
the rotopress,

793
01:21:51,583 --> 01:21:54,333
and the Boston press
must be loaded first.

794
01:21:54,417 --> 01:21:55,917
We must find out--

795
01:21:56,418 --> 01:21:58,669
Didn't I express myself
clearly enough?

796
01:21:58,751 --> 01:22:01,169
I said dismantle the machines!

797
01:22:01,253 --> 01:22:04,503
You've got exactly six days
to dismantle and pack everything!

798
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:08,380
Anything not working afterwards
counts as sabotage!

799
01:22:08,463 --> 01:22:10,840
What's wrong with you?
Get them moving!

800
01:22:10,923 --> 01:22:13,007
Standing there
like stuffed dummies.

801
01:22:13,090 --> 01:22:15,674
The Exakt platen press,

802
01:22:15,757 --> 01:22:19,509
the rotopress, and the Boston press
must be loaded first.

803
01:22:19,593 --> 01:22:23,177
Herr Hauptscharführer,
where are we being moved?

804
01:22:23,261 --> 01:22:26,595
How dare you?
Think we're a travel agency?

805
01:22:27,635 --> 01:22:28,927
Are you stupid, or what?

806
01:22:30,012 --> 01:22:31,137
A stupid fucking Jew!

807
01:22:36,263 --> 01:22:38,431
Hurry up!

808
01:22:49,768 --> 01:22:51,352
Those aren't aircraft bombs.

809
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:56,104
They're not aircraft bombs,
it's artillery!

810
01:22:57,105 --> 01:22:58,605
The Allies are outside Berlin!

811
01:23:05,107 --> 01:23:07,108
If the war's ending, they'll kill us.

812
01:23:27,031 --> 01:23:28,197
Lads!

813
01:23:29,615 --> 01:23:32,740
The machines will be
taken to a safe hiding place.

814
01:23:32,823 --> 01:23:34,116
Secret caves in the Alps.

815
01:23:35,783 --> 01:23:36,992
You'll be following on.

816
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:45,786
Hand these out to the men!

817
01:23:46,787 --> 01:23:47,954
Don't worry, men!

818
01:23:48,954 --> 01:23:50,788
We'll all be fine
come the Final Victory!

819
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,052
The shoe-testing squad.

820
01:24:32,802 --> 01:24:33,968
They're not there anymore.

821
01:25:15,815 --> 01:25:16,982
What are you doing here?

822
01:25:18,816 --> 01:25:22,568
I forgot something.

823
01:25:22,652 --> 01:25:24,235
Sorowitsch, I warn you.

824
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:27,235
If I'm harmed,
you'll all be liquidated!

825
01:25:27,319 --> 01:25:29,070
I'm your only chance of surviving!

826
01:25:39,990 --> 01:25:41,157
Do you want the money?

827
01:25:42,991 --> 01:25:44,408
We can share the money!

828
01:25:47,494 --> 01:25:48,743
Is it about Kolya?

829
01:25:50,661 --> 01:25:52,244
It was Holst who shot him!

830
01:25:52,328 --> 01:25:55,913
I know you think
Holst was only following orders.

831
01:25:55,996 --> 01:25:57,330
But what do you think I did?

832
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:03,414
I always treated you well!

833
01:26:03,498 --> 01:26:05,748
No other prisoners
were treated so well as here!

834
01:26:07,165 --> 01:26:09,333
I can't save the entire
Jewish race on my own!

835
01:26:13,334 --> 01:26:15,752
One has to look after oneself.

836
01:26:16,835 --> 01:26:18,336
You know that better than anyone.

837
01:26:26,672 --> 01:26:29,090
You've pissed yourself.

838
01:27:31,359 --> 01:27:32,859
What's happened here, Sally?

839
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:35,027
Herzog.

840
01:27:36,111 --> 01:27:39,445
- You haven't...?
- I wanted to kill him, but...

841
01:27:40,947 --> 01:27:42,363
I let him go.

842
01:27:48,407 --> 01:27:49,908
They'll put us up against a wall.

843
01:27:55,034 --> 01:27:58,119
That would've suited you,
wouldn't it?

844
01:27:58,202 --> 01:27:59,995
If they'd shot you too.

845
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:04,286
It's over.

846
01:28:05,245 --> 01:28:06,537
The war's over.

847
01:28:08,371 --> 01:28:09,955
No one will come for us now.

848
01:28:11,706 --> 01:28:14,582
I'm just not cut out
to play the martyr.

849
01:28:14,666 --> 01:28:15,832
Got any cards?

850
01:28:27,711 --> 01:28:31,462
Our people have taken over
the camp! This is the end.

851
01:28:31,546 --> 01:28:32,879
We're free!

852
01:28:34,755 --> 01:28:36,715
Dr. Klinger, internal medicine.

853
01:28:38,297 --> 01:28:41,632
We're the inmates
from Blocks 18 and 19.

854
01:28:41,716 --> 01:28:43,883
I know him! He's SS!

855
01:28:43,967 --> 01:28:45,968
No, no, no!

856
01:28:46,051 --> 01:28:48,427
Operation Bernhard.

857
01:28:48,551 --> 01:28:51,093
- We're prisoners!
- Mow them down, the scum!

858
01:28:51,176 --> 01:28:52,301
We're Jews.

859
01:28:52,385 --> 01:28:53,636
Shoot them, the fat pigs!

860
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,470
Here!
Jewish nose, big ears!

861
01:28:55,554 --> 01:28:57,179
Don't shoot.
We're prisoners.

862
01:28:57,263 --> 01:28:58,680
Here, Auschwitz!

863
01:29:00,514 --> 01:29:02,097
Who else was in Auschwitz?

864
01:30:04,368 --> 01:30:08,328
We let the negatives
for the dollar overheat,

865
01:30:08,411 --> 01:30:10,911
to make the contours blur.

866
01:30:12,036 --> 01:30:14,245
They threatened to shoot us.

867
01:30:15,246 --> 01:30:17,329
This is Burger!
He's a hero!

868
01:30:17,413 --> 01:30:18,914
Say something!

869
01:30:20,497 --> 01:30:22,831
And then it was too late!

870
01:30:22,914 --> 01:30:25,166
The dollar would have changed
the course of the war.

871
01:30:25,249 --> 01:30:28,333
They'd have had heaps of dough.

872
01:30:31,044 --> 01:30:33,585
Sometimes we heard
that lovely music.

873
01:30:43,505 --> 01:30:47,423
We made the pound here.

874
01:30:47,506 --> 01:30:48,674
Clever, eh?

875
01:31:06,387 --> 01:31:08,388
I told him he had to keep going.

876
01:31:11,389 --> 01:31:12,723
I only said...

877
01:31:12,806 --> 01:31:15,016
he had to survive
until it was over.

878
01:31:17,932 --> 01:31:19,059
What an idiot.

879
01:31:19,142 --> 01:31:20,476
Best get away from here.

880
01:31:23,435 --> 01:31:24,852
Forget all about it!

881
01:31:33,105 --> 01:31:38,106
Where do I take him?
He's dead.

882
01:31:56,987 --> 01:31:58,322
Full house.

883
01:32:10,159 --> 01:32:11,409
Full house.

884
01:33:17,889 --> 01:33:19,056
To change?

885
01:33:19,139 --> 01:33:21,139
No, for the staff.

886
01:33:28,142 --> 01:33:30,726
May I offer you a bottle
of champagne on the house?

887
01:33:55,983 --> 01:33:58,068
You had bad luck?

888
01:34:04,821 --> 01:34:06,403
So much money!

889
01:34:16,659 --> 01:34:18,242
So much money!

890
01:34:19,158 --> 01:34:21,326
We can always
make us some more.

891
01:34:26,828 --> 01:34:29,494
The Sachsenhausen
counterfeiting workshop

892
01:34:29,577 --> 01:34:31,995
forged pound notes to
a total value of £132 million...

893
01:34:32,995 --> 01:34:36,330
equivalent to four times Britain's
foreign currency reserves.

894
01:34:37,540 --> 01:34:39,749
Thanks to the inmates'
delaying tactics,

895
01:34:39,832 --> 01:34:42,499
only a very small number
of dollars was produced.

896
01:34:43,999 --> 01:34:45,917
