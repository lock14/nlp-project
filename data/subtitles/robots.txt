Push! Push!
A work of 12 hours.
Will it be that it was worth to the feather?
Only look for him!
Rodney Copperbottom! He/she has the eyes
of his/her mother and my father's nose.
It was good to have kept
those parts!
I feel that he will accomplish big
done for the world!
Dear, what does that break is?
They always put one
he/she leaves extra.
Did we want a boy, right?
He/she won't hurt anything, son.
It is his/her narizinho.
It is yours...
- Hello, son!
- Will I win new parts?
He/she goes yes!
- But they are not brilliant...
- Well, they are used...
They were given by the
my cousin Jeffrey.
And they are alone for that year.
- Father, who is that?
- That is Bigweld.
The largest robot of the world.
I thought you went
the largest robot of the world!
Besides me!
He is owner of the industries Bigweld.
He invents things that
they improve the life of all.
- Can I know him/it?
- Clear. Who knows one day?
- Father, what do you make?
- I work at a chic restaurant.
I am lava-plates!
Live of Robot City,
the show of Bigweld.
He/she walks, father! He/she is losing.
I am going, Rodney!
I had to bring work home.
Mr. Gunk is collecting me.
He/she is now his/her presenter, Bigweld!
Welcome! I thought you/they would like
of giving a walk in the industries Bigweld.
There it is the main gate.
And it is very nice!
- Good morning, Tim!
- Good morning, Mr. Bigweld.
Tim, who did the main gate close?
- I thought...
- We never closed the main gate!
It would be the same as
to end with our ideas!
Everyday robots come here
to show their new ideas!
I listen all of them.
And remember. You don't care
it is done of surpluses or of new parts.
You can shine, it doesn't matter
of what it is done.
He is speaking to me, father.
With certainty, son.
Certain, personal.
We will invent!
But all of the inventions that exist
they were born of a good idea!
Then seek a need and begin
to have ideas for us to supply such need.
An idea takes the other and
before you notice...
you got!
Discover the need and put an end to her!
It is that, father! I have to seek...
a need.
He/she calms there...
Hello, boy!
Here they are their 12 year-old parts.
- They are...
- Second-hand.
I know, father.
But I don't call.
They Belong to his/her cousin Veronica.
You know that her
it is quite popular!
As soon as his/her warranty ends,
you begin to fall to the pieces.
- Soon I will be covered with adhesive ribbon.
- Try again, father.
Rodney, you ended
with all of the problems of that?
We go there! That goes
to facilitate his/her work.
I invented for you.
- Certain, we will try.
- Great! It is now.
Robot-fantastic, to the work!
- Copperbottom!
- Mr. Gunk!
- The one what is this?
- My son invented.
- The one what is making?
- Mr. Gunk, you scared him.
He/she is destroying my kitchen!
- I will stop him/it.
- Not!
- Was his/her son?
- My father didn't have to do anything with that.
He is a brilliant boy
and it invented that.
Clean that mess!
And you leave of here, inventor.
You will never be anything besides the
son of a washer of plates.
Somebody removes that oil of me.
He/she will frighten the customers.
- Round trip?
- Only departure.
There it is you!
I told you that he/she would find him/it.
It is the maternal instinct.
He left a ticket saying
that it left of train!
He/she leaves for there. Catch his/her suitcase,
he/she will go back home now.
No, mother. I need to do that.
I am going to Robot City to arrange a job
and to help the father to pay Mr. Gunk.
Speak to him.
Robot City?
- You are just a boy!
- I will never be somebody here.
I want to be an inventor
as Bigweld.
I want to be somebody!
You are somebody. Somebody that
he/she won't arise in that train.
- I go yes.
- Speak to him.
- A passage for Robot City.
- Where what does think goes?
Who goes is him.
- But...
- Rodney, I wanted to be musician in his/her age.
I played well, but my father
it thought it would not be future.
Then I ended up being a washer of plates.
I am not complaining.
But I always said for me same...
if I could choose again,
he/she would follow my heart.
You are big, Rodney.
Never doubt.
Go to Robot City,
find Bigweld
and show him their great ideas.
And Rodney, never give up.
All the on board.
Mother...
I won't disappoint him/it, father.
You will be proud of me!
I know that yes.
With license, it was able to...
He/she can tell me where they are
the industries Bigweld?
- Perfect! They are 50 silvers.
- 50 silvers? For the the something?
For a beautiful picture of his/her first
moment in Robot City!
Now it is his/her second moment.
They are more 50 dollars.
Is he/she writing down?
Help me here! More presence, less pose.
Inside of you he/she has a model
ready to leave.
Feel big eyes,
same to the of Japanese drawing.
- I am adoring!
- I don't want pictures.
- Doesn't he/she want?
- Not!
Everything well, the camera is without film.
Does he/she want a map with the houses of the famous ones?
Where him?
I am "with a free screw"
Does he/she want to buy a clock?
Don't buy us, we are falsified.
Close.
With license, as I do for
to arrive in the industries Bigweld?
He/she leaves for there.
With license, as I do for
to arrive in the industries Bigweld?
How?
Ta, thank you.
The express that it crosses the city with
I destine to the industries Bigweld is leaving.
Children cannot travel alone.
It is advisable to hold their movable parts.
Forced to all and a good morning.
What...?
Do I have, are you following myself?
No.
First time in the express?
- Actually me...
- Gee!
Good luck in the big city. If he/she does
success here, will do anywhere.
If it doesn't get,
welcome to the club.
- Oh, not!
- What was the one?
- We left the rail! We will fall!
- The one what?
I was playing.
Put the hands among the legs.
There he/she is leaving my point.
My parts are falling.
That shame.
Excuse.
It was very worse, he/she had
a gigantic hammer.
He/she still has!
Be with me, boy. I know the
city as the palm of my hand.
I have, that is new.
"You can shine, it doesn't matter
of what it is done."
With license, can I help him/it?
Excuse, me... I have!
- You are Tim of the program of TV!
- I am me!
Hello, Tim. Who did the gate close?
- Him never clamor...
- The one what you want?
I would like to see Mr. Bigweld.
I am an inventor.
Why didn't say soon he/she?
Wait there.
Thank you!
I caught you! You were
all lively and there "bum!"
Certain, I already had fun.
He/she can enter.
That is very funny!
It was the second time.
He/she thought I will let to enter him.
But I don't go.
Excuse boy, but
they are rules of the company.
Like them they will negotiate
new inventors like this?
Don't go!
That is thing of the past.
Return two years ago and
maybe get a job!
And remember. You don't care
it is done of surpluses or of new parts.
You can shine, it doesn't matter
of what it is done.
Mine ours. That delegated extraordinary.
Concern with the common robot.
They are not more values like this.
And for a good reason.
That doesn't give money!
Wake up! We are not one
charity company!
It is for that that Bigweld no
he/she sits down more in that chair.
It is a relic!
I don't want more to hear
"please, Bigweld... "
We can say next month,
in the party of Bigweld!
Now we will suck all the
the common robots' cents.
What do the more robots want?
Improvements, personal!
It is like this that we will make money.
We were always telling the robots that not
he/she matters of what are done.
Like this they won't feel rusty
and they won't buy our improvements.
Therefore I invented a new slogan.
"Why you to be when
can you be new? "
I found diamond, but I want
the employees' opinion.
Very good, boss Ratchet!
Don't look down.
I have, he/she leaves!
Shoo!
Leave! Shoo!
Leave from me!
- Cappy, you didn't say anything.
- He/she gave me chills.
- Thank you.
- But...
But?
Why would the robots buy improvements
if the parts are a lot
more cockroaches?
It is easy. Starting from today not
we will manufacture more parts!
He/she knows what call robots that
cannot they buy improvements?
Junk-dealer! You see them in the streets,
full of rust,
Them nor they are scrubbed!
Cappy, want his/her department
working in the new slogan.
I will transfer her/it for one
room beside mine.
We will work juntinhos in that.
Won't it be entertaining?
A lot.
- Excuse.
- The one what...?
I am a youth inventor
and my dream was always
to come for Robot City
to show my ideas
for Mr. Bigweld.
That it seems not to be here...
But he left me in the command.
Then let to show me the one that
that can do.
I have a better idea.
I will show you the one that
that can do.
He can make that!
How was it?
What devils is he/she having here?
A starchy idiot is
seating in the place of Bigweld!
I like to sit down in the sidewalk.
I will return.
And I will discover what is having!
You do be devoted
to you cause lost!
I already knew dreamer like you.
He/she sneaks out, crazy!
Certain, hour of the rest.
He/she ended, continue working!
- Who comes there?
- Hi, mother!
Hello, dear.
How is it going my boy?
Great! I did exactly
as it ordered!
We won't be more extra parts.
In some weeks those losers
there of top they will turn junk-dealer.
You can control everything!
That good boy!
And when we end with Bigweld
nobody more it can repair them.
Exactly! Can it explain to me again?
Stupid! All idolize him/it!
And if he decides to return?
Mother, he won't cause
problem from where is.
Of the one what does have fear he/she?
Take courage!
Or does he/she want to finish equal to his/her father?
Hi, son. That good to see you.
Imagine that on the contrary
of industries Bigweld
be Indústrias Ratchet.
Continue speaking.
- Ratchet City!
- It seems brilliant.
Without Bigweld we won't have
more difficulties!
- We are going ahead!
- That is my boy!
Is he/she hungry? Does he/she want to eat something?
He/she is thin.
No, mother. I need to go. Good-bye.
- Good-bye, father.
- Even plus, son.
Good luck with yours
malicious plans.
Hello.
To think I am
being small is because...
I am leaving out!
Stop there!
You took my foot!
Great.
- Is it happy now?
- Only when it returns me my foot, thief!
I am not thief.
I am just a stranger.
I didn't see that it was his/her foot.
- Let to help me him.
- No, he/she can leave.
I have my pride.
Here!
No, wait...
Wait!
No, no...
He/she is not fast, not
he/she has anything in the garbage.
I have, Diesel!
I found a vocal part for you.
He/she has other here.
Don't render. Feel that.
I never find parts of my size.
What was, boy?
To split, did you lose weight?
Did he/she lose weight? His/her donkey, is the head
of him in a basket! We are ended.
Shut up. He/she would give a slap
in you if he/she had hand!
Speaking in the devil, there I come!
Hurt!
Only see! Who would play out
a coffeepot so bonitinho?
Be not afraid.
- I have, that is mine!
- It is him!
It was that guy! I recognize
that face and that foot.
He is there, stupid.
He is the thief that
he/she pulled my head.
Does he/she want to pull another piece?
He/she thinks can make that
with my brother, you... it is even bonitinho.
Can Piper, behave?
We have to repair Splitting.
Again.
That is yours.
To purpose, I am Piper.
I am fire!
I see you thereabout.
We already spoke hundreds of times:
don't "speak with strange."
I speak to you.
Who can stranger be?
I have good and bad news.
- Which is the bad?
- I checked the stock
and starting from today they don't manufacture more
parts for you.
- You were discontinued officially.
- Done discontinue?
That good.
And which is the good news?
If we had their parts,
they would be for sale!
How did that go to happen?
I am practically a boy!
Be controlled. You only need
of an improvement.
- The new improvements are too much.
- Has just arrived.
They have door-glasses even.
- Does he/she have size super big?
- Clear!
See the new collection
Spring Bigweld.
I cannot buy that luxury.
I only need a committee for the neck.
Why is that
happening with me?
I am hurting myself.
Stupid!
Excuse, friend.
It is the improvement or undo him/it.
Do undo? No!
I am well.
See, without the hands.
- I am back. Did longings feel?
- Nobody goes for it undoes him/it!
Quite so! But as
does it think we would get in him?
Stop with that!
Listen here.
Find my brother's part.
We are neither garbage nor junk-dealer!
We won't be treated like this.
Lament, I don't have the parts.
But he/she has screws, spray
anti-corrosive and plastic.
I can repair him/it easily.
"The force is powerful in that there."
When it was the last time
what did take oil?
I cannot answer,
my sister is here.
- Stop with that, to Split!
- Be stopped. He/she can make tickles.
We were not presented.
I call to Split.
He/she called me Bumper, but I had
that to change when I came for here.
- My name is Rodney Copperbottom.
- Tell me...
- Why was in the garbage?
- Well, today I tried to see Bigweld...
To meet him, say that we needed
a lot that he returns.
- He worried about robots like us.
- I heard to say that he got tired
and he/she abandoned us for
we fall to the pieces.
Well, I think it is ready.
Only see! He repaired my neck!
- Sweeping!
- Sweeping?
Hide!
- Which is the problem?
- If you are an obsolete model,
- as Splitting...
- I have!
They sweep you and you
they take for it undoes him/it.
There they melt you and they transform you
in another thing.
He/she wants to say...
He/she has an obsolete model
that you won't diffuse!
To split, run!
When the robots are in a rut,
there is no best place than the Tia Nádegas.
I will inform that we are here.
Aunt Buttocks!
- We brought somebody.
- I am at the kitchen.
- is he/she sure that his/her aunt doesn't care?
- Relax, she is not my aunt.
She welcomes robots that
they are... hard.
- Blessed it is.
- And why do call her/it of Tia Nádegas?
Because we are not able to
to call her/it of Tia Bunda!
She has the behind one
little big.
Until there everything well, but
when she is with gases...
Forgive me, I am so clumsy...
Hello, who are you, my youth?
I am Rodney Bundão...
No! Rodney Copperbottom!
Copperbottom.
That wonderful name.
- The one with his/her friend what was there?
- He was flipped.
There it is!
Aunt Buttocks, he needs
of a place to be.
Feel home.
- Thank you, it is his/her a lot of kindness.
- The pleasure is mine.
Which is his/her need?
I have, he/she spoke equal to Bigweld.
That is that he/she is robot...
It can be at my room.
Don't call the gossips.
He/she forgot a place.
To split, leave my room!
I am out. I am inside.
I am out.
Leave my room!
Face, is the third time that I go
to the bathroom. He/she has something wrong with me.
Excuse.
Here we are. Home sweet home.
What is mine is yours.
- It pulls life...
- I diffuse.
Another arm wrestling.
Can it separate them? Wait,
my backs are scratching.
I know that it seemed a fart,
but I did with the hand under the arm.
Does he/she know how to do? It is difficult, since
we are of metal.
But it is there that he/she enters the ability.
I am almost there. Listen.
No, wait...
That seemed of old.
I am a little tired.
- Tomorrow we talked.
- Did he/she have a difficult day, it was not?
My father should be waiting for mine
connection to count that success I did.
I know that it is not his/her problem. If you
he/she annoys their friends ends without them.
Are you a cookie of the luck?
The friends are for that...
- Do you consider me as friend?
- Clear. Or else what would the one be?
A shame, a desperate one...
the list is long.
- We will be with the friend.
- Same tends a difficult day, remember...
Tomorrow it will be same!
My last room friend
did he/she jump of that window, did he/she know?
Do I have, to Split?
It is that there, expensive!
Are you 3 years old?
A man does like this...
You are disgusting!
Besides, it is like this that it is done...
Children, only listen...
Aunt Buttocks, we were
doing with the armpits!
- Excuse...
- Mrs., please...
I need a doctor.
That will wake up you.
Hot oil of the Tia Nádegas.
Care, is hot!
What will you make today?
- We are already doing.
- And as for you?
Bigweld disappeared and
you are there seating.
I think you already know about that.
I need to discover him/it
that it happened with him.
- Does he/she want a piece of advice?
- Clear.
Forget that.
My slogan is been you never
to try, it will never fail."
Crank, the idol of all disappeared
and nobody seems if it matters.
He/she should have a crowd
infuriated outside.
But the one what...?
Diamond, my friend!
Now say should rain money."
Say! Say...
Lament, personal. Everything is out of print.
I will only receive improvements of here for front.
But I like me of the way that I am.
We cannot buy improvements!
Do I have, what is making? Don't play me!
I have, he/she is that boy that repaired Splitting. He repairs robots!
- It is, he can help them. - You will be famous.
Only the ones that have warranty. He/she leaves for there... all come!
I need parts.
You don't seem so... bad.
I have, personal! Extra parts!
Wait there!
- The one what is with you there? - They owed if it feels embarrassed!
Why is with two noses?
One breathes and the other sneezes.
It was badly.
Could he/she take a look in my arm?
- Beautiful handshake.
- He/she wanted to get rid of that tire. - I am losing the head!
Back!
He also has dreams that won't take place.
"Why you to be same? "
"Discover the need and put an end to her! "
Wait!
Who wants to be repaired?
Thank you, Rodney. You are too much.
Rodney! Rodney!
Rodney! Rodney!
I felt never so relaxed.
Could he/she scrub among my shoulder pads?
He/she is too strong. He/she calms there!
Does he/she want to kill me?
Relax, he/she is his/her mother.
- As it arrived here? - For the ventilation, I know that it doesn't like them
to see me.
- The one what you want? - Somebody is repairing them.
- The one what? - Somebody is repairing obsolete models!
- They are laughing at you! - Who?
Is he/she sure that you/they are not "laughing with me?"
I have.
Is it then if a fanatic nut is repairing obsolete? Who does care he/she?
Use the brain that I stole for you. Today it is just a, but and is fashion
seen?
We can repair ourselves, we didn't need improvements! "
We "want Bigweld." He/she knows what will happen with you!
Certain, have calm. We have to discover who is and to stop him/it.
Just not to stop him/it. To squeeze him/it! To destroy him/it!
To purpose, he/she brought a decoration for his/her table.
Does he/she have more anybody waiting?
Let to see me.
Some.
- Some? - For what did the one wait, Rodney?
Bigweld disappeared, the sweepers are to the free,
but there he/she appears Copperbottom!
- I am hysterical only of thinking in that! - I am not Bigweld.
- Those robots need parts. - Mail!
Mail for Copperbottom.
It belongs to his/her mother.
- Does he/she have something for me? - He/she has yes.
It belongs to my sister!
I recognized the letter.
Something wrong?
He/she says that his/her father is on the verge of turning junk-dealer.
If they don't arrange parts for him,
he/she will only live more some miles.
Is Rodney, very concerned with his/her father? Does he/she want to go home?
Same if I go cannot help him/it.
He needs parts and only Bigweld can solve that.
He wants to say something. What was, boy?
Bigweld... it goes...
to dance!
Clear! The dance of Bigweld!
It cannot have dance without Bigweld!
Then it is that! I will go to the dance.
It is the chic party of the year. Nor it will go by the gate.
- Can I help them? - I have faith that yes.
That is Condorodorik Von Grokenzipper!
Knowner like Conde Del Crock.
Where are the trumpets?
They were promised trumpets to announce the count's arrival.
Excuse, his/her grace. I can beat myself until being happy.
He is happy and I don't feel bad also.
- You are not in the list? - As it is that it is?
Again.
Thank you.
We leave. Explain to their superiors the reason
why we could not participate in his/her lual, party, be there what goes.
- We are going! - Not! Wait!
They can enter. Actually,
would the count like to beat me?
That arrogance!
I will beat you on behalf of him.
Thank you, his/her grace.
Certain, we will separate.
To meet Bigweld, call me.
If something gives wrong, we have to use a sign.
What sign type? Something subtle type "has to go" or...
What such that?
We are going to the work.
- Beating, no moved. - Yes, gentleman.
I want what he took!
I like that sees me like this, Cappy. Far away from the work.
He/she can see my side more informal, more loving.
Where were we?
I was never interested in men in those parties.
Good night, young ladies. Conde Von to Split at your disposal.
I am Loretta. You seem to be an eccentric millionaire.
Ladies and gentlemen, receive his/her boss,
- Mr. Ratchet! - Thank you.
That is the hour in that I have the honor of presenting to you
ours adored Bigweld,
that unhappily could not attend.
How?
He ordered their excuses, his/her affection and that sack of cookies.
- Doesn't he come? - The one what are you making here?
What did you make with Bigweld?
Why don't see him/it more?
- Safety, we have a gatecrasher. - It is quite so!
I had to put that garbage hill to enter here
and to say for Bigweld that you are putting an end to millions of robots
that the day I passed repairing!
You!
The voice of the duty calls me!
I need to leave!
Take him/it for a walk and they swallow him/it of turn as clips!
- Not! - Not?
I take him/it outside.
Doesn't he/she want to seem bad for the people, right?
- Well thought. - When I return, I will show my informal side.
- We are going walking! - The one what is making?
Saving his/her life.
Let us go!
- Let to go him! Please, let to go him! - Leave of here, his/her idiot!
Diffuse them!
We will Split!
To split, wait for me!
Fantastibot!
Leave front!
Tim, I would like to see Mr. Bigweld!
Be not able to!
It was incredible! Where we do go now?
I will take you for the train station.
Of way none!
He/she doesn't know with what is working. Ratchet will kill you.
I won't leave before finding Bigweld.
Can you take me until him?
I must have been crazy.
Good-bye, my wanted.
Thank you for bringing me home.
- It is just more a care the. - Until tomorrow?
I will count the seconds.
4 up to now!
His/her maluquinho.
Maluquinho for you.
I am singing in the oil"
I am singing in the oil"
"After so much work, I am slipping in the oil"
I "know what have to do"
"To satisfy" you
My life changed! From now on, I am a winner!
Now that I feel alive you cannot make that!
I help...
Certain, we tried. We leave.
No, he/she has something strange. All see those newspapers and correspondences.
They must already have stopped giving does time.
Newspaper!
Last edition.
- You something spoke? - His/her beautiful picture.
Evil "robot invades dance" - we Go, we have to remove you of here.
That it carries frightening. Perfect.
See that place!
It is the studio of Bigweld! I recognized of the tv program.
Speak quietly, we should not be here.
What does the one know that? The original drawings of the inventions of
Bigweld!
He drew!
That strange. Why would he stop in the middle?
Look! Does he/she remember that?
He/she appeared in the program.
- Rodney, don't know how I can speak, but... - Why are so covered in dust?
Wait! No...
It is much more complex than the ones that appeared in the program.
- What will Rodney, make? - I don't know, that is innovation for me!
It is him!
- Who is the king of the beach? - Are you well?
Considering that I am an old one fat that has just fallen in the ground,
I am fantastic. Now, who devils are you?
I am Rodney.
I thought it was the deliverer of dominoes.
We will arrange again! That time will be larger.
Mister, is it in that what has been working?
Is it for that what is disappeared?
Boy, nobody likes of talkative.
But a terrible crisis is happening. We needed to talk.
Filho, you are causing a first terrible impression.
Mister, he is his/her largest fan. Actually, he is an inventor.
As well as you. Show what you did.
A device?
Don't get scared. Show to Mr. Bigweld that can do.
It can go, it is everything well.
Is it that what he does?
- He is nervous under pressure, but... - Filho, I will feel a piece of advice.
- Yes... - Give up.
Is he/she telling me to abandon everything? - I said "gives up."
But to "abandon" also serves.
Is it that what you did? Therefore it is here while Ratchet
does he/she transform robots as my father in obsolete?
Sometimes you have to know that doesn't work more.
But you are Bigweld! It can repair any thing!
I thought so.
To have a company for me meant to improve the life of all.
But Ratchet made money and that was more important.
I was old-fashioned. I became obsolete.
Go to house, son. If he won me, you will expire.
Who you sought doesn't exist more!
Find another foolish dream!
Now if they give me license, I am a lot... busy.
I am seeing.
Everything that I wanted was to be like him.
Help! Open that!
Close! He/she can close!
How many parts only see!
So many things that I always wanted...
That is too much!
- For here, mother. - It lets me to look! I don't tolerate!
- He/she cannot look, it is surprised. - You are an evil boy.
Look!
"Crazy mom" - it is with the full tank!
It is ready when he/she wants.
You are the best son that a mother can have.
I also discovered who was repairing the robots.
That belezinha will slice all of the obsolete models that to find.
I am only made sick of looking.
What is that?
That is not right!
Help!
Rivet Town, please.
Hi, mother. I am well.
- And you and the dad? - He is well here.
I will pass for him.
Hello, amigão! How does it go?
Hi, father. How are you?
I am well. Me...
I only caught some rain.
We are only with difficulties of finding some parts.
But we will speak about you.
What is making he/she? Did he/she find with Bigweld?
I found yes.
- But... - What was the one, son?
It was not how we waited, father.
It is not... I am not able to...
I understand.
- Excuse to be disappointed. - Anything of that.
You would never be disappointed, Rodney.
Listen, I know that it is not easy.
But to give up a dream
it can worry for the rest of the life.
- Yes, father. - It is with you, son.
- His/her father loves you a lot. - I know.
If he/she wants to speak with his/her family and friends he/she will have 500
minutes free.
Rodney, wait!
- His/her suitcase. - Thank you, but me no...
Their friends wanted to come to dismiss also.
Why didn't come?
They came.
Of next time we will split a taxi.
Who is she?
I had a body like this.
A passage for any place!
To split?
I have a sister!
A sister very it finds strange.
I saw the sweepers!
They are there below and they will come to stick to!
And who do guess is behind everything?
- Ratchet. - Don't they want to try to guess?
- We go there, they can try. - Ratchet!
Ratchet. We won't last one week.
Certain, I have a plan. All will catch the train!
Wait for a little. Are all giving up?
- It was you that began. - And I will finish.
My mistake was to think Bigweld would struggle for us.
But the responsibility is ours! If we don't stop Ratchet, nobody will stop.
We will hit back!
- To struggle doesn't solve the things. - To give up also not!
- Me that he/she says him/it. - He/she is the boss.
As it beats my heart.
If you will struggle, I am going with you.
- Does it go even? - Who is that charming lady?
- Why? - I know there...
Because I am man, woman's taste...
No. Why will help us?
Why I want to be same to you.
Then we go there.
We will give to Ratchet a repair to the old fashion!
That man!
Somebody calls a crane.
Mother, I am already adult! Stop telling me how to kill Bigweld.
I will do in the day that wants and as he/she wants.
I want you two in my room in 10 minutes.
Should Mr. Bigweld, also go?
No, be here and watch the dad's limousine.
- Yes, gentleman. - I am going there inside to kick some behind.
His/her boyfriend is a genius.
- He is not... is it? - Am I?
Thank you for still to believe in me.
It is good to be home.
He makes to feel as if everyday they went a party...
Say Ratchet that he has company.
Yes, gentleman!
Mr. Bigweld!
Say that I am not here! Don't let to enter him!
Ratchet!
- I go direct to the subject. - The one what was there? Did they finish the
dominoes?
- I order more! - It is dismissed!
But the company never gave so much profit!
- He/she can leave! - No, listen to me please!
He/she cannot make that with me, that job is my life!
Everything is for me. He/she doesn't know what did to arrive here.
The lies that I counted, the lives that I ruined...
That is not helping each other me.
Call the safety.
Wait! Can I make a last appeal?
What does certain, mean?
That!
Mine ours, I am as crazy as my mother!
Light the fat for it undoes him/it and put my name in his/her vacancy.
Loosen him/it!
Face, boy. He/she ended.
You lost. Bigweld will be melted to turn an improvement.
With you, his/her stupid coffeepot and Cappy.
That waste.
- Mr. Bigweld, are you well? - I am the most beautiful girl of the dance.
I will consider as a "no!"
Leave the road!
Rodney!
You only pay capuchin monkey!
It is Rodney. It seems that it is in trouble!
- I have to repair him/it. - Certain, I protect you!
We have to help Rodney.
- You are here. - Anything of that!
We will face a great battle. He/she doesn't matter what will happen with us.
Live his/her life.
You are the only thing that I have!
Piper, they are going to a great battle.
I got!
What is Rodney, happening?
- Where are we? - It is everything well.
Certain, boys! They are well where wanted. Get up.
He/she looks at the hands there below.
Rodney, came to survive!
How are we doing?
The socket. Hold strong, I need to arrive to the other side.
We will leave of here.
- It is it undoes. - It is that. Game end.
He/she still didn't finish.
It is our chance of shining.
It is when we showed of what are done.
In my case, it is a metal called rare "medum." It is yellow,
he/she has chicken taste...
He/she didn't know that could make that.
Rodney is right. I am tired
of complaining and never to do anything.
Me... I want to try.
Forget, I feel a lot... No, me...
I want to try!
Then you are the first.
First so that?
Do they want us to make improvements? Then we will make them.
Gasket, you are an evil and unhealthy robot.
I try.
That good! Company!
You are the busybody that it has been causing so many problems.
But who are those losers?
- Mister, us... - I am woman!
We came to rescue our friend, sack of screws of the evil!
And you will be defeated in their own domains.
Yes, because they are 7 against only 1.
- We are 7 against ...8, 9... - Did it count that there?
I think so. Can they be quiet?
I lost the bill, I will have to count again!
While it is counting, include that!
As soon as I end with you, they will invade the streets.
That will be his/her last day!
Did I lose the commemoration?
No.
Actually, it arrived early.
Rodney! Rodney!
Then we will begin!
He/she ordered well, sister!
To attack!
Oh, not! He went diffuse!
Only see that devastating blow!
He climbs until the top...
and it puts an end to all!
Say hi for my "amigona."
That will be disgusting!
- Is he/she thinking about the one what am thinking? - With certainty!
- He/she discovers a need and put an end to her! - I was not thinking about
that.
What are you making? Release me!
Come unfastened! Obey!
My improvements!
Everything well, son. You can shine, it doesn't matter of what is...
Stop!
Come, Rodney. We will open the gates of the industry for all!
First I need to do a thing.
- Herb! - The one what is making, done want?
- It is Rodney, dear! - Is he well?
- Come outside. - Copperbottom, where what does think goes?
And the plates?
I have, return here!
He/she will never again wash anything in that city!
What is that? The whole city is here.
- Rodney? - Father!
I want him to know somebody.
- That is... - Bigweld, father.
The largest robot of the world.
- Besides you. - I know that he/she needs some parts.
I am not of complaining, but...
He/she has enough to set up two of you.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I came here...
- Stop with that, he/she is becoming distracted. - Excuse.
Where was I?
Mr. and Mrs. Copperbottom, I came here
to tell them personally that his/her son Rodney,
the responsible for removing me of my confinement,
he/she is my new right robot and my future successor.
Filho...
Father, I know that always if he/she felt bad for not could give me a lot of
thing,
but you gave me the most important thing.
You believed in me.
Since the moment in that he/she was born.
Now I want that his/her dream if it accomplishes.
You always wanted to be musician.
Now be one!
For all they listen.
It is that there, Herb!
Now I am sure that I have a heart.
Forgive me, but I am a little rusty.
There he/she is leaving our happy end.
No, it is a jazz mixture and funk.
He/she calls himself "junk."
I love you, dear!
- To split! - My dear Loretta!
Oops! Excuse!
I am in the list of the party! Who doesn't know he/she I am?
