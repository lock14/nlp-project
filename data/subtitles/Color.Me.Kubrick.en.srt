Meet local girls from Snapchat on

00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,191
These houses all look
the same to me.

3
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,088
That"s because...
they are all the fucking same!

4
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:06,092
Is it me or is it
"The Telegraph" crossword?

5
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,529
Is what you
or "The Telegraph" crossword?

6
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,032
Lt"s getting difficult.

7
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:15,230
Is it more difficult to do or
is my ability to do it lessening?

8
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,433
Probably a bit of both, Freddie.

9
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:19,908
It can"t be "anal", can it?

10
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,911
No, dear.
Not on "The Telegraph"!

11
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:27,012
Your handwriting is a disgrace.
I can hardly read this, can I?

12
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,987
Is this the address
that he gave you?

13
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,023
Yeah. That"s what it says.
It"s where we picked him up!

14
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:36,217
You want some of this?

15
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:38,521
Dirt bag!

16
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,891
God! Who on Earth
could that be at this time?

17
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,266
- L"ll go, dear.
- No, no, no. L"ll get it.

18
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,207
L"m afraid you"ve got
the wrong house.

19
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,942
- How would you know that now?
- L"ve told you.

20
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:05,788
Now take your foot out of the door
or I shall have to call the police.

21
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:09,587
Listen up, major, we"ve come
to see Stanley Kubrick.

22
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,287
There"s no one of that name here.
Good night.

23
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,399
Who are you? The butler?

24
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,862
No, l"m not the bloody butler.

25
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,404
Go tell your master Mr. Kubrick
that we have come to see him.

26
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,473
- Mister who?
- Kubrick.

27
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,871
The famous film director.

28
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,378
- Never heard of him.
- Stanley has been a frequenter...

29
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:33,211
of a club that we and some associates
run over in King"s Cross, all right?

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,286
He"s run up a bloody big bar bill
of 200 quid last Thursday...

31
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,890
and he borrowed
one hundred in Nelsons.

32
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,024
- Nelsons?
- Nelson Neddies.

33
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,090
Reddies, cash, squire.

34
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,325
Cash is what the poor people use
instead of credit card, you sawy?

35
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,970
There"s no man of that name here.

36
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,801
And there are no reddies,
no Nelson Eddies. So...

37
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:01,107
We know he lives here!
Well, enough of this.

38
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,483
We know he lives here
because we picked him up from here!

39
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,680
Steven, if you please.

40
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,884
- He owes us money!
- And he"s hiding in there!

41
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,495
For the last time,
button it, you two!

42
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,103
What a wonderful drawing!

43
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,742
And such inovative design.

44
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,706
Good designs are as rare today...

45
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:14,611
as good scripts,
please, believe me.

46
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,813
Are they?

47
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,889
Do you mind if I join you?

48
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,724
Please.

49
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,262
Thank you. That"s very kind.

50
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:32,695
L"ve been at the film studios
in a production meeting all day.

51
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,901
I just had to have a drink
on the way home.

52
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,270
I just had to.
Would you?

53
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,640
No. Not just now, thanks.

54
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,818
May I?

55
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,649
Yes, please.

56
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:04,028
- Are these your designs?
- L"ve put together a new collection.

57
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:09,265
L"m very impressed.
It"s very... original.

58
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,377
That is a charming suit.

59
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,010
L"d be very proud
to wear a suit like that.

60
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,078
You must be very successful.

61
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:28,350
L"ve got designs being considered by
knit wear company in Huddersfield...

62
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:32,290
and there"s a boutique in Brighton
very interested in my jackets.

63
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:37,296
There"s a man in Margaret Street who
thinks my trousers are so exciting.

64
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,998
- He does?
- Yes, he just loves them.

65
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:45,675
And so he should, my friend.
So he should.

66
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,613
- L"m sorry, what is your name?
- L"m Rupert. Rupert Rodnight.

67
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,919
And l"m quite exceptionally
pleased to meet you.

68
00:05:58,324 --> 00:05:59,689
Good. Thank you.

69
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,922
I didn"t catch your name.

70
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:05,859
Stanley.

71
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,159
Stanley.

72
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,934
Stanley Kubrick.

73
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,000
Stanley Kubrick?

74
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,710
What? Stanley Kubrick,
the film director?

75
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,878
Yes, unless there is another one.

76
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,715
There you are, Stanley.
Another triple brandy.

77
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,055
Thanks, you are a sweetie.

78
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:39,086
And l"ll reciprocate
this kindness as soon as l"ve...

79
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,896
been to the bank and sorted out
all these damn stolen credit cards.

80
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,798
No, it"s not a problem, honestly.

81
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:50,499
It is. Such graciousness
cannot go unrecognized.

82
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,871
Do you know? L"ve never designed
the costumes for a film before.

83
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,571
I mean, any film.

84
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:02,047
This portfolio of yours convinces me
that only you could do it.

85
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:06,822
I think this is gonna be
the happiest relationship...

86
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:09,460
l"ve ever had
with a costume designer.

87
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,597
You haven"t told
me the title yet.

88
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,866
It"s catchy. It"s called
"Designer Death". It"s about...

89
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,333
a male model
who stumbles upon a murder.

90
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:23,435
And designing his wardrobe
is what I want you to do.

91
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,043
We shoot on location there
on Pinewood Studios.

92
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:29,214
Have to be with me the whole time.

93
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:31,309
It"s a challenge.

94
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,279
No. The whole time.

95
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,473
Sorry, but I feel
so much more relaxed now.

96
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,543
Can I get you another Spitzer?

97
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,007
No, no, I still got some left.

98
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,519
Ah, such a nice apartment.

99
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,216
And very cheap.

100
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:17,228
My people rented it for me
under an assumed name...

101
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,058
so I could be nearer
to the studio...

102
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,097
l"m building in Wealdstone.

103
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:26,399
But, Rupert, you mustn"t tell
anyone about that. You mustn"t.

104
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,439
Oh, no, no.
It"s an absolute secret with me.

105
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,739
I knew it would be.

106
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:36,442
Now we"re working, of course,
very feverishly on the script.

107
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,878
But I have to get you a hardcopy...

108
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:45,114
so you can start designing
for specific scenes.

109
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,759
By the way, do you have an agent?

110
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,293
No, l"ve always handled myself.

111
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,596
I used to handle myself...

112
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,963
but now I prefer
letting someone else do it.

113
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,564
You don"t always
have the choice, do you?

114
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,872
We don"t always have the choice.

115
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,204
L"m going to take you
under my wing...

116
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:12,140
and l"m going to make sure
that nobody handles you...

117
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,416
except myself.

118
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,003
I need to speak to Mr. Kubrick!

119
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,405
<i>I need to see Mr. Kubrick!</i>
<i>Where is he?</i>

120
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,971
<i>I need justice!</i>

121
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:46,149
I need the justice and the
satisfaction that is due to me!

122
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,689
I want this Stanley Kubrick!

123
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,024
Come on, sir.
Come along with us, please.

124
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,455
Calm down.

125
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:02,198
Just get in the car!
Thank you.

126
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,275
He alone was going to finance and
produce my "Virginia Woolf".

127
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,812
I turned all the other backers away.

128
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:17,476
I told my friends, the cast...

129
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,348
"Mr. Kubrick"s behind me".

130
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,740
<i>Yes, l"m a personal friend!</i>

131
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,117
Yes, a personal friend
of Stanley Kubrick.

132
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,380
I need to contact him.

133
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,681
The number I have for his home seems
to be out of order or something.

134
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,588
<i>How can you not have heard of</i>
<i>him? He"s a famous movie director!</i>

135
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:19,168
Yeah. "2001 - Spacey Odissey",
"The Shining"...

136
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:24,003
What else? "Doctor Strangelove",
"Clockwork Orange"!

137
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,842
"Full Metal Jacket",
you must have heard of that!

138
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,576
<i>So the band is playing this gig</i>
<i>up in Camden.</i>

139
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:35,242
<i>This guy comes up to me and starts</i>
<i>trying to tell me how good they are.</i>

140
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,046
<i>Then he tells me who he is.</i>

141
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,783
Stanley Kubrick, the film director.

142
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,459
- Stanley "fucking" Kubrick!
- Fuck me!

143
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:46,529
Exactly. Amazing.
So, anyway, we get chatting...

144
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:50,131
and Stanley says how he can help us.
You know, help the band.

145
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:53,462
Who would"ve thought Stanley Kubrick
was into heavy metal, then?

146
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:56,232
So he said "When is the next gig?"
I told him about this one at Roxxy.

147
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,637
- And he wanted to come?
- Right.

148
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:01,506
So I said we"d pick him up,
ferry him out there.

149
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,409
He"s got a big apartment
in Little Venice.

150
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,276
- That"s where we"re collecting him.
- Pretty smart address.

151
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,782
The guy"s loaded...

152
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,979
but more important than that:
He"s got the contacts.

153
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,352
You see, normally,
l"d have this address in...

154
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:18,988
Belgravia. And what l"d do,
you see, is that...

155
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:22,929
<i>the people I was meeting,</i>
<i>very important people.</i>

156
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,928
<i>L"d give them this address and</i>
<i>they"d come by to pick me up...</i>

157
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,108
<i>at a very specific time.</i>

158
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,705
And when they got there...

159
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,738
<i>l"d be sitting</i>
<i>on the front steps...</i>

160
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,549
<i>pretty as a picture.</i>
<i>You see?</i>

161
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,085
It always worked.

162
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:04,602
- Nothing here now, dear.
<i>- They thought it was my house.</i>

163
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:06,972
Simple.

164
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:12,843
But then the neighborhood
started to go downhill.

165
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,951
Arabs, blacks,
all sorts of riff-raff.

166
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:21,990
Obviously, I couldn"t find myself
associated with those people...

167
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:28,560
so I decided to find somewhere
a little more media-ish.

168
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,930
You know, a little more me.

169
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,137
Little Venice.

170
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:56,124
<i>You didn"t tell him you used</i>
<i>to make a few pirate tapes...</i>

171
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,159
of "Clockwork Orange",
up at Camden, did you?

172
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,524
<i>Shut up, Toby.</i>

173
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:24,147
- You see the numbers?
- L"ll slow down, have a squint.

174
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,910
He"ll probably
invite us up for drinks.

175
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,607
L"ve never met anyone
like Stanley Kubrick.

176
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,115
It"s flat 8.

177
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,557
Right. Flat 8.

178
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,753
Gentlemen, over here!

179
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,959
Here I am! Over here

180
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:15,206
You simply must forgive me!
You simply must!

181
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:19,935
L"ve been talking over old
creative differences with Marlon!

182
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:24,175
The trouble with Marlon is
he thinks he"s Brando.

183
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,651
He would not let me go!
Simply wouldn"t!

184
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,315
That"s all right, Stanley!
Good to see ya!

185
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:35,857
Very good to see you, Spencer!
Very good indeed!

186
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:40,094
This is Toby! He"s the co-manager
of Exterminating Angels!

187
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,296
We"re working together!

188
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:48,064
- Very good to see you, Toby!
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Kubrick!

189
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,141
Stanley, please.

190
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,877
So, what movie are you
working on now, Stan?

191
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:01,780
It is a science fiction
comedy-drama...

192
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:06,048
Iove affair, caper movies,
set in the future.

193
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,653
Sounds great. What"s it called?

194
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,432
"All Night Prescriptions".

195
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:19,099
Wacky title.
"All Night Prescriptions".

196
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,797
So, who have you got in it, Stan?

197
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,472
L"ve still got the casting to do.

198
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:28,745
Madonna wants in,
but I told her, "Madonna"...

199
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:35,578
I told her, "Madonna, darling,
stick to the day job: The singing".

200
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,753
Jack Nicholson wants in to,
but I said to him, "Jack...

201
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,357
you know what the protocol is.

202
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,894
L"ve got to offer it
to Harrison Ford first".

203
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:52,602
And little Tommy Cruise would like a
part, and I said to him "Perhaps"...

204
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,132
over breakfast this morning
at the Savoy.

205
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,944
Jesus! Some line-up, Stan!

206
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,842
Now, boys, in this next movie...

207
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:06,643
a metal rock group
plays a very important part.

208
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:11,719
That"s where
Exterminating Angels comes in.

209
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,524
I need an unknown group...

210
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,752
but one possesses star quality.

211
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:21,132
Exterminating Angels
are your lads, Stanley.

212
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,857
They"ve got everything it takes.

213
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,393
Well, then you should listen,
shouldn"t you?

214
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,899
Well, I presume that"s what you"re
supposed to do, or am I mistaken?

215
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,576
I am a personal friend
of Stanley Kubrick!

216
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,635
Yes, that"s who I am!

217
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,038
And one word from Mr. Kubrick...

218
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,808
and you would be out of a job,
you stupid little man!

219
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,292
Back in a few, boys.

220
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,399
- We"ve got it fucking made!
- I know.

221
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:59,036
I can actually see Exterminating
Angels becoming a phenomenon.

222
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,295
That"s for sure.

223
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,838
If we haven"t got phenomena
potential, then I don"t know who has.

224
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,640
Either of you boys
have any cash on you?

225
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:09,439
I seem to have left
my Laser Platinum...

226
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:13,015
no-limit American
Express VIP card at home.

227
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,115
Sure, Stan.
How much do you want?

228
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:19,287
Enough for some cigarretes
and a drop of vodka...

229
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,391
for my throat irritation.

230
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,458
Here"s twenty.
Keep the change.

231
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,227
Rich people never have
any cash on them, do they?

232
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,459
- I mean, it"s vulgar.
- They don"t.

233
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,936
But that, Toby, my old son, has got
to be the best fucking 20 quid...

234
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,803
we"ve ever invested
in our whole fucking lives!

235
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,710
Fucking Stanley
fucking Kubrick, man!

236
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,212
- Don"t do that in front of him.
- So what?

237
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,945
Either of you boys
crave a taste?

238
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:52,186
No, it"s all right, Stan.
Not while l"m at the wheel.

239
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,590
<i>All the way from Acton,</i>
<i>West London...</i>

240
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:59,025
the one and only
Exterminating Angels!

241
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,836
Boys, I believe
Exterminating Angels...

242
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:47,239
will become a coast-to-coast
sensation in America.

243
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:50,414
But we have to be careful
how we play it...

244
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:54,052
because you do not get
a second chance...

245
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:59,186
to make a first impression
on the great American public!

246
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,426
You fucking ass!

247
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:05,656
I knew l"d get a hold of you
one day, you fucking "great doctor"!

248
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,396
Hold on!

249
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,658
You"ve had it.
You have tons of money! Fuck it!

250
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,769
- Wait. You"re way out of it, Pilgrim!
- Oh, yeah? Let me at him!

251
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,462
We"re not having anyone
talking like that to our guest!

252
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:19,633
"Our guest!" Oh, I pray you, tell,
why on Earth fucking not?

253
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,472
Because he"s our fucking guest...

254
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,715
and "cause he"s Stanley
fucking Kubrick, that"s why.

255
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,817
No, he fucking ain"t!
He ain"t Stanley Kubrick!

256
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,454
He"s a fucking conman
called Alan Conway...

257
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:33,921
and he owes my band 200 fucking quid
which he don"t have it!

258
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,787
What?

259
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,292
I wanna drag him out!

260
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,936
You"re fucking joking! There he is!

261
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,603
You wanker!

262
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,935
You fucking Conway!

263
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,711
Never had a famous film director
in my cab before.

264
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,543
Well, thank you
for a very pleasant chat.

265
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:05,019
Deepak, you"ve got my number,
so there"s no excuse not to call.

266
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:08,681
My idea is to start you off
on some standing role...

267
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:12,328
and then gravitate toward
some small speaking roles.

268
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:14,596
Over the moon, I am!

269
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,433
Now, you need to wait
for me a couple of minutes.

270
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:21,297
L"m gonna run in and
borrow some cash off my son.

271
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:28,010
L"m going to leave here in the back
my Louis Vuitton shoulder bag...

272
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:32,114
which Louis himself personally
gave me, for your piece of mind.

273
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,581
- There"s no need to do that, Mr...
- Ah! I insist.

274
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:33,438
You say he was ordinary
looking, average height...

275
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:37,639
and to that, we can add that
he calls himself Stanley Kubrick.

276
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:40,909
He cost me 40 quid.
40 fucking quid!

277
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:42,983
Okay, sir.

278
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:47,690
Now, we can go formal,
and you can give us a statement...

279
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:50,156
and while you"re doing that...

280
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:54,321
l"ll get one of my PCs to verify the
road-worthiness of your vehicle.

281
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,035
Or... We can call it a night.

282
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:00,235
Damn it!

283
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:13,013
You know, Sean,
I don"t mind you staying here...

284
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:16,210
but you really must learn
how to tidy up after yourself.

285
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:21,986
And I do not like your dirty knickers
and socks in the kitchen sink.

286
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,959
There"s a laundro down the road.

287
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:27,131
Yeah, keep your wig on, Stanley.

288
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:32,531
- Did you see this here in the paper?
- What in the paper?

289
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:36,036
About this serial gay killer who"s
going all over London and killing?

290
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,639
No, what about it?

291
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:42,007
Well, it says he murdered someone
last night over in Tennyson Road.

292
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,876
Tennyson Road?
But that"s just at the end here.

293
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,315
You got any fairies at your garden?

294
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,246
No.

295
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,720
Perhaps he might be
paying you a visit next.

296
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,617
What"s the world coming to, eh?

297
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,452
When a bloke can"t go around,
minding his own business...

298
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,290
commiting acts against nature...

299
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,899
without running the risk of
bumping into a homicidal maniac?

300
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,825
Too right.

301
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,270
I know him very well.

302
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:11,272
Of course, he left his calling card
in "2001- Spacey Odissey", but...

303
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,808
- none of us recognized it.
- 2001?

304
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,536
Yes, HAL computer.
????
...

305
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:19,183
Positively Danny Debonair,
with that voice.

306
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,416
That"s why he killed the astronaut.

307
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,850
Wanted to be alone
with the other beef cake.

308
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:28,249
What"s he working on now, Kubrick?

309
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,526
He"s doing a remake of that
Julie Christie film, "Darling".

310
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,525
And she"s a boy this time.

311
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:37,527
They wouldn"t let John Schlesinger
get away with that in the 1960"s.

312
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:38,964
It sounds captivating.

313
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,035
It is, dear.
Very captivating.

314
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:45,275
L"ve got a rather juicy part in it.
So it"ll be good-bye soaps for "moi".

315
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,946
Well, they do say in Hollywood
the only way to the top...

316
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,105
is through the bottom.

317
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,124
- L"m a friend of Stanley Kubrick.
- I couldn"t hear that.

318
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:13,028
- Stan and I were talking about you.
- Really?

319
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,631
Yeah. Come meet Stan.

320
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,620
I want to get into films, sir.
I really do.

321
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:37,758
Well...

322
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:48,062
He"s straight.
I think it"d be worthy.

323
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:50,197
To advance his career.

324
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,409
Do you like them straight?

325
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,342
That"s the attraction, eh?

326
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,193
"Dear Mr. Kubrick...

327
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,633
I would like to alert you
to an impostor who uses your name...

328
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,134
"Stanley Kubrick"...

329
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,800
as a cover for his wicked actions.

330
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:25,599
His real name is Alan Conway.

331
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,641
I first met him
in Marseille last year...

332
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:29,905
when I was working as a rent boy.

333
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,048
Conway recks people"s lives...

334
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,311
and has no moral conscience."

335
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,885
All yours, my friend.
Now, that will be...

336
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:42,084
£16.20.

337
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:45,254
And you won"t mind a check,
of course, Mordecai?

338
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:47,861
Oh, no, no, no.
You live around the corner.

339
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:52,592
Advice.

340
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:57,973
You were gonna give me some.
The amateur rock group that I manage.

341
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,406
Mordecai, it"s tricky, you see?

342
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:05,572
Rock is the single most treacherous
area for the show biz entrepreneur.

343
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,419
As a matter of fact,
when I was in L. A...

344
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,818
I had to sort out some
really sticky problems for Bruce.

345
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:15,192
What Bruce?

346
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,552
Springsteen.

347
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:25,297
Why don"t you come around my house
tomorrow evening, say eightish...

348
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:27,696
and we"ll discuss it fully then.

349
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:30,167
Got you.

350
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:32,801
Will be there.

351
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,738
There"s Stanley.
Stanley!

352
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,877
- How are you?
- How are you, Jasper?

353
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:43,117
L"d like you to meet Oliver,
my lawyer.

354
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:45,015
Oliver, Stanley Kubrick.

355
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,224
Very great honor
to meet you, Mr. Kubrick.

356
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:51,122
No, Stanley, please. You know,
that "Mr." puts years on me!

357
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,088
Sure.

358
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:56,597
Shall we repair to the "salle privé",
where we can talk in private?

359
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:00,266
Show me the way
to the "salle privé"!

360
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:01,764
Excellent.

361
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,267
- Figgy?
- Sir?

362
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:06,542
- Bottle of champers.
- Coming out.

363
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:13,582
When you told me you lost your
Limited Edition Mont Blanc pen...

364
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,446
that Tom Cruise had given you...

365
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:19,487
I thought the very least
I could do was to replace it.

366
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,390
Shall I open?

367
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:32,302
Oh, my God, that is perfect!
That is absolutely perfect!

368
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,808
Oh, Jasper, l"m so touched!

369
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,605
L"m too kind!

370
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:43,006
Oh, l"m so pleased that
you"re pleased, Stanley.

371
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:45,842
It"s wonderful! Look at that!

372
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,651
Do you have the receipt?

373
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:54,855
So... You"re not feeling yourself?

374
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,325
He didn"t say
he wasn"t feeling himself.

375
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,827
He said he wasn"t himself.
He was somebody else.

376
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,095
Since when? And who?

377
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,728
Didn"t say.

378
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:11,306
To me, he"s Alan Conway.
To you, he"s Alan Conway.

379
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:14,067
Yes, but to him,
he"s not Alan Conway.

380
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:19,444
- Who is he, then?
- What I said was...

381
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:22,751
l"m not who you think I am.

382
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,554
Didn"t I say that?

383
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:32,119
Alan Conway is merely
a name I use when l"m here.

384
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:35,355
Not only here. In the shop, also.

385
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,400
Here.

386
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,673
Here.
When l"m here, in Wealdstone.

387
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,339
When l"m staying here,
here about.

388
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,584
Why is that, then?

389
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:04,254
I suppose that at times I grow quite
disgusted by the razzle-dazzle...

390
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:07,192
noise and glitz of the showbiz.

391
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:15,003
And at times, I must concentrate on
what is truly important in my life...

392
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,571
my work.

393
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:20,508
And I must be undisturbed.

394
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,340
This is my hideaway...

395
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:31,111
my space for inner tranquility.

396
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,555
Very nice.

397
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:45,101
So, who are you?
If you"re not Alan Conway?

398
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,604
L"m Stanley Kubrick,
the film director.

399
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:51,536
- Stanley...
- Kubrick?

400
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:55,506
How long have you been him then?

401
00:31:56,447 --> 00:32:00,281
L"ve always been him.
I am him.

402
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,277
L"m also Shirley Bassey"s agent...

403
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,547
which is why I was recently
in the States...

404
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,225
and I was a child actor.

405
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:11,759
I played Pip in David Lean"s
"Great Expectations".

406
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:17,661
I was also a holiday rep.
A big one.

407
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:20,997
All that, and he knows
how to promote a rock group?

408
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:22,297
Such talent!

409
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:25,499
Tomorrow morning...

410
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:30,075
I have a meeting
with Miss Elizabeth Taylor.

411
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:34,479
We are endeavoring to raise some
funds for the Betty Ford Clinic.

412
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:38,182
But I feel that
our meeting is so early...

413
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:42,481
that my bank will be closed.
I was wondering if either of you...

414
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:45,686
could possibly cash a personal
check for me this evening?

415
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,130
Sure.

416
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:51,924
Thank you.

417
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,669
What you"re saying is
that this overdraft...

418
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:58,806
that prevents Jasper from
opening further wine bars?

419
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,102
Correct.

420
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,712
And this overdraft
stands at £350,000?

421
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,778
£354,500, to be precise.

422
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:13,319
And you"re looking for me
to act as guarantor for that sum?

423
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:15,048
Yes, yes.

424
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:17,584
That"s an acceptable option
for the bank.

425
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:20,821
- You"ll be made director, of course.
- Sounds pretty simple to me.

426
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:24,164
Stanley, all my problems
are solved if you do that.

427
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:27,661
There is no prob...
You know?

428
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:30,136
Oliver, if you can get
the paperwork together...

429
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,434
l"ll run it by
my New York attorneys...

430
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,769
and we"ll be ready to tango.

431
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,849
- L"ll do that tomorrow.
- This time next year...

432
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:43,242
we"re gonna be opening
wine bars in Paris, France!

433
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,613
Yes!

434
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,721
There"s a problem with this pen.

435
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,586
Oh, dear, what seems
to be the problem?

436
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:52,361
Well, the knib.

437
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:57,198
- We can change it for you, sir.
- Well, it"s not just the knib.

438
00:33:57,668 --> 00:34:01,764
It"s the pen itself.
It"s so big and bulky.

439
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,898
Makes my hand tired.

440
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,242
- L"d like a refund.
- Certainly. You have the receipt?

441
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,311
Here it is.

442
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,382
Thank you.

443
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,525
Right. We can recredit your
VISA card. L"ll do it for you now.

444
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,057
My VISA card?

445
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:26,025
You paid for it by VISA,
and we"ll simply recredit your card.

446
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,026
No, but I want cash.

447
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:31,192
L"m afraid
we don"t do that here, sir.

448
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,769
When I spoke with my attorney
Milt Greenberg in New York...

449
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:43,040
he says he was very happy
with those papers.

450
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,841
There was no reason
whatsoever not to sign them.

451
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:50,280
You"ll be guarantor until such time
as Jasper has discharged the amount.

452
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:54,286
Which I estimate will be
three to four years, at max.

453
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:57,659
The banks are perfectly happy.
They checked you out, Stanley...

454
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:02,299
- and you came up A-1 okay.
- I bet I did.

455
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,435
I told the manager you"re not to pay
for anything whenever you come in.

456
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:08,434
Drinks, the food... Everything
is on the house from now on.

457
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,551
What is it, Stanley?
What"s the title?

458
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:27,587
Lt"s "3001 - A Space Odissey".

459
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:30,422
Wow! And who have you got?

460
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,722
John Malkovich in the lead.

461
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,758
John who?

462
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,460
He will redefine astronaut.
Redefine it.

463
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,963
But of course Warner Bros. Says...

464
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:47,372
"But he"s not big enough
to carry this picture".

465
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:51,977
And I said, "Oh, really?"
So, now l"ve solved that.

466
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:54,844
- How? How have you solved it?
- It"s simple.

467
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:01,156
Miss Elizabeth Taylor
as mission control.

468
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,961
What was it Gore Vidal said?

469
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,030
Vidal?
Oh, the thing about...

470
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,827
"The only people who enjoy
themselves in the theater...

471
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,936
are those who are
already on the stage"?

472
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,941
- That was certainly true tonight.
- Well, was it ever?

473
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:22,445
You noticed that gentleman behind us
was asleep before the end of Act I?

474
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:27,910
He"d wake up through the dialogues,
and as soon as the music was...

475
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:37,759
Excuse me. Could you tell me
who these people are next to us?

476
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:40,122
Yes, yes, A journalist
from the "New York Times".

477
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,629
It"s Frank Rich,
famous drama critic...

478
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,059
and it is Mrs. Frank Rich.

479
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:47,160
- Thank you.
- You"re welcome.

480
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:58,879
I do not like what your newspaper
wrote about me. Not at all.

481
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,577
I beg your pardon?

482
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:05,381
I said I did not like what
your newspaper wrote about me...

483
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,525
and I am not a recluse.

484
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:13,129
A recluse wouldn"t be coming into
a restaurant like this, now would he?

485
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:15,526
And who are you?

486
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,024
I am Stanley Kubrick.

487
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:21,303
And I nearly sued
your newspaper once.

488
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,034
And l"ve shaved off my beard off.

489
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:31,406
Well, please, sit down, join us.
This is my wife, Alix.

490
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,343
- Hello.
- How do you do?

491
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,018
- Please, sit down.
- I can"t.

492
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:37,346
I have my people waiting.

493
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:40,185
- You"re Frank Rich, aren"t you?
- Yes.

494
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:41,688
- Drama critic?
- Yes.

495
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:43,450
- L"m Butch.
- Of course you are.

496
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:48,097
L"ve a good play l"d like you
to read. I want to be a playwright.

497
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:50,426
Really? You know,
l"ve never heard that before.

498
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,865
So, you"ve been to
Sunset Boulevard?

499
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:54,395
Yes.

500
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:59,074
Yes, we have.
Patti Lupone is a friend.

501
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:02,438
She"s the best of it.
The rest of the cast is shit.

502
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,772
Frankly, they laid an egg.
8 months, it closes.

503
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,013
I was invited to preview.

504
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,183
Are you working on another movie?

505
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,484
Yes. L"m in pre-production.

506
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:16,917
How about an interview?

507
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:19,988
No.
Do you know why?

508
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:22,961
Because I never give interviews.

509
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:32,265
This is a ring which
Christian Dior gave to Helmut...

510
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,575
who gave it to me...

511
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,447
and now, I give it to you.

512
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,779
Thank you, that"s very nice.

513
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:42,614
You"re lovely.

514
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,289
Good night.

515
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:55,122
Come on, Kubrick!

516
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:59,395
So was that really Stanley Kubrick,
the director?

517
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:02,936
Well, I assume it"s Stanley Kubrick,
but I wouldn"t swear on it.

518
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,046
I know you.

519
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:16,653
You appeared in one
of my films, haven"t you?

520
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:20,423
Your face is so familiar.
L"m just trying to...

521
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:22,057
place which one it was.

522
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:26,957
Well, sit down and buy me
a drink while you decide.

523
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:29,931
Buy you a drink?

524
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:35,430
Well... What are you drinking?

525
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,196
Jack Daniel"s.

526
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,169
A large one.

527
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:41,638
- Barman?
- Yes, sir?

528
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:45,643
Another large Jack Daniel"s, please,
and another glass of mineral water.

529
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,882
So, you"re a what...

530
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,789
a real life
film producer now, are you?

531
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:58,853
Would you like a cigarrete?

532
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,623
No, thanks, I don"t smoke.
But, you know, you go ahead.

533
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:04,865
Thank you.

534
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:09,399
So, would I have heard of you?
Would I have seen one of your films?

535
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,173
You may have.

536
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:12,869
What"s your name?

537
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,848
Stanley Kubrick?

538
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,054
Fuck me!

539
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,253
Stanley...

540
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:35,259
you are one of my favorite
directors of all time.

541
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,961
I have seen all of your films and I
have loved every single one of them.

542
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:42,897
This is unbelievable.
An honor.

543
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:44,772
I mean, l"ve seen...

544
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:49,570
"Spartacus", which was brilliant.
"Lolita", fantastic.

545
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,441
"Dr. Strangelove"...

546
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:53,815
"Clockwork Orange"...

547
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:55,817
"Barry Lyndon"...

548
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:59,953
What was it? My favorite, this is my
favorite: "Judgement in Nuremberg".

549
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:09,064
Odd you say that, because that was
quite a difficult film to make.

550
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:14,135
L"ve had a lot of problems, but
it all worked out well in the end.

551
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:17,936
Absolutely. Yes, it did.
That was amazing.

552
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,201
That was just amazing.

553
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:24,039
Do you know, what amazes me
the most about that is that...

554
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:29,613
you know, that it was directed
by Stanley Kramer...

555
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,552
not Stanly Kubrick.

556
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:37,826
Oh, dear...

557
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:41,559
You"ve got your Stanleys
in the twist, haven"t you?

558
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:47,065
Listen, mate, let me give you
a little bit of advice.

559
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:53,140
If you"re gonna come here pretending
you"re someone that you"re not...

560
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:58,111
at least do us the courtesy of doing
a little bit of research, okay?

561
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,822
I found one.

562
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,857
Good, "cause there isn"t a single
photo in any one of these books.

563
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:16,196
In this one, he"s got a beard.

564
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:19,536
But he did say
he "shaved off his beard off".

565
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,028
Right.

566
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:25,799
- When was this taken?
- About 1971.

567
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:29,978
Doesn"t look a thing
like that guy.

568
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,169
Not a thing.

569
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:36,185
I got a tip off
about this Kubrick impostor.

570
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,746
The story was right up my street.

571
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,618
<i>Kubrick himself</i>
<i>has got a problem here.</i>

572
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:46,789
<i>In order to get an injuction</i>
<i>out against Conway...</i>

573
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:50,228
<i>he has to prove that Conway</i>
<i>is impersonating him.</i>

574
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,560
<i>But to do that, he"s got get</i>
<i>some people to stand up in court...</i>

575
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,329
<i>and admit they were conned.</i>

576
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:58,406
<i>Well, it"s bad enough</i>
<i>being conned by someone.</i>

577
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:02,168
You wouldn"t wanna tell the
whole world about it, would you?

578
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:04,378
Well, I wouldn"t.

579
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,506
Cooperation?

580
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:09,686
What kind of cooperation
are we talking about here then?

581
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:13,550
Statements from each of you to begin
with and we"ll call you as witnesses.

582
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,726
Hold on. I don"t mind helping you
as much as I can, but...

583
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:20,294
I can"t go to court. It will be in
the papers, and everyone will know.

584
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:23,193
Yeah. I can"t afford that either.
No way.

585
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:26,434
They"ll think Spencer and me
are a couple of puffs!

586
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:29,495
No offense,
but you know what I mean.

587
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:31,004
Actually, I have no idea
what you mean.

588
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,574
L"ve got a cab office to run,
and a corner shop.

589
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:39,407
<i>Stanley had called me to say...</i>

590
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,676
<i>his son had died</i>
<i>in a car accident.</i>

591
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:44,376
<i>And he said that he wanted me</i>
<i>with him at this terrible moment.</i>

592
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:47,952
<i>When I told him I could only</i>
<i>afford to come a few days...</i>

593
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:50,793
<i>he told me he"d need me</i>
<i>within for the foreseeable future.</i>

594
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:56,066
<i>And even beyond that, to the part of</i>
<i>the future that we couldn"t foresee.</i>

595
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:58,225
Thanks.

596
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,899
<i>He then offered</i>
<i>to pay off the balance...</i>

597
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:03,664
<i>of an apartment</i>
<i>I had in Marseille...</i>

598
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:08,337
<i>which I had been rehabing</i>
<i>with two dear friends of mine.</i>

599
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,339
<i>He told me to bring</i>
<i>their bank details...</i>

600
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:15,349
<i>and would have his attorney</i>
<i>handle it immediately.</i>

601
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:20,045
<i>He also said his driver, Manolo,</i>
<i>would be at the airport...</i>

602
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:21,986
<i>to whisk me off</i>
<i>in his white Jaguar.</i>

603
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,788
<i>He wasn"t.</i>

604
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:26,728
My client, as you know...

605
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:30,093
has lost many thousands of pounds
as a result of this impostor and...

606
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,997
his understanding with the banks in
question is in doubt. Nevertheless...

607
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:37,332
for reasons which I think
you will readily appreciate...

608
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:40,101
he cannot go further
and appear in an action...

609
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,574
which will expose
him to public ridicule...

610
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,907
for having been
taken in by this con man.

611
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:47,913
Even if it means that it stops Conway
from doing the same thing to others?

612
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,376
Not even.

613
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:52,515
I see.

614
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:57,320
Oh, Stanley...

615
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:02,663
I admit it!

616
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:05,693
I admit it!

617
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:08,632
I knew you weren"t him.
I just knew it.

618
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:20,274
L"m not Stanley Kubrick, I know.
L"m Alan Conway!

619
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:26,249
Alan Conway,
one of life"s great failures!

620
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,049
Please, you must forgive me!

621
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:34,224
Well, what about having a son
who was killed in a car accident?

622
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:37,195
I suppose that"s all lies
and bullshit too, isn"t it?

623
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:41,994
Please, please, Piers, I would"ve
said anything to get you here.

624
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:43,639
Please, you must forgive me.

625
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:45,934
You fucked over
my friends in Marseille!

626
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,339
I gave up my apartment there.

627
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:50,479
I used my savings
to come over here.

628
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:54,448
My bridges are all burned,
and you ask me to forgive you?

629
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:57,313
Please, Piers, you must forgive me.
You have to.

630
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:59,522
Forgive a disaster queen like you?

631
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,384
No fucking chance!

632
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:04,158
Piers!

633
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:08,887
Piers!

634
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:12,063
I certainly need you!

635
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:15,567
Never had such
genuine feelings for anyone!

636
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:20,673
L"ve never felt
something so big inside me!

637
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:28,743
I mean, feelings for someone else
so big in me! Really, really!

638
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,386
Lt"s just I have to try
to escape myself!

639
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:37,219
Whenever I go to somewhere
nice like New York...

640
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:41,921
or Benidorm or...
Or Camp du Mor...

641
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:44,961
or Rio...

642
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:50,132
who is the first person there
to greet me?

643
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:53,235
Lt"s Alan Conway!

644
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:57,812
L"m only trying to escape myself.

645
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:02,844
That"s why I have to pretend
to be someone else.

646
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,011
Please, don"t go, Piers.
Please.

647
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,023
I thought we had something.

648
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:12,321
I really did.

649
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:16,862
- No! Piers, you mustn"t go, please!
- Don"t.

650
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,660
- Get the...
- Piers, please!

651
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:29,410
You see, I thought I could be
myself with you.

652
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,309
Jesus!

653
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,813
I thought you could help me!

654
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:36,744
I thought I could help you.

655
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,594
I thought we had a future.

656
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:08,668
What happened to you happened
to a very dear friend of mine.

657
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:12,406
He didn"t eat properly.
Just the booze and the drugs.

658
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,141
And then, one day,
he just collapsed.

659
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:17,377
See, your body can only take
so much abuse.

660
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:21,690
Body? Abuse?
Sounds interesting.

661
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,118
Well, we"re not gonna let
it happen again, are we?

662
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:30,232
We"re going to eat regularly, we"re
going to reduce our alcohol intake.

663
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:32,331
Let"s see.

664
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:37,967
You"re used to having
stiff things in your mouth, huh?

665
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:40,336
They don"t stay stiff for long.

666
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:45,673
L"m being discharged
tomorrow, then?

667
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:48,880
After sir has seen you,
and not before.

668
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:56,190
You wouldn"t care to join me at my
hotel tomorrow night, would you?

669
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:58,924
You"re so forward!

670
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:02,360
I thought you"d never ask.

671
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:10,234
No, you see, because Alan Conway
is merely my "nom de travel".

672
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:15,207
Life is much easier sailing
under that "nom".

673
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:19,542
Because then l"m not bothered
and hassled by people.

674
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:24,485
Which is very important
for a man in my position.

675
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:29,018
So what should I call you then?
Should I call you Alan or Stanley?

676
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:33,987
You see, people who know me,
"simpatico" people...

677
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:37,629
they always call me Stanley,
of course.

678
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:41,535
Well, knock me over
with a sponge dildo!

679
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:46,573
Lt"s amazing, I mean, it"s just...
Staggeringly amazing!

680
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:51,974
At times, I have to get away from
the glitz and glamour of showbiz...

681
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:54,946
away from the jet set,
the servants...

682
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:58,685
the kiss-ass creeps.

683
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:03,588
You see, I have to stay in touch
with the common man...

684
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:07,154
the common folk,
the salt of the earth...

685
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:11,460
the unwashed, the unloved,
the unwanted...

686
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:15,136
the unknown, the unattractive.

687
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:17,272
Sounds like a full-time job to me.

688
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:23,440
But it"s not already time
for your party, is it?

689
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,715
Yes, it is. Come on, then.

690
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:28,741
I knew Lee Pratt before
he was famous...

691
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:32,278
when he"d come down here to play all
the clubs. I met him on the scene.

692
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:35,822
Very active, you know, although
none of his audience know that.

693
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:37,994
They all think
he"s as straight as narrow.

694
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:42,994
I saw his television show
once on... television.

695
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:47,162
You know, I nearly
cast him in one of my films.

696
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,895
Well, tell him that.
His head will get even bigger.

697
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,041
He"s the biggest
praise queen I know.

698
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,273
What do you think of the house then?
Isn"t it amazing?

699
00:51:57,681 --> 00:51:58,739
Hello!

700
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,780
John, how are you?
Nice to see you.

701
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:04,148
My friend Stanley Kubrick.

702
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,987
Would you like some bubbly and?

703
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:10,952
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.
- Would you like to go on now?

704
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:15,093
L"d like you to meet
my friend Stanley Kubrick.

705
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:17,764
Nice to meet you.

706
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:27,834
Oh, look.

707
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,431
Stan, the man!

708
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:35,411
The United States of America
have defeated me.

709
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:37,876
Totally defeated me.
Isn"t that right, Norman?

710
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:40,675
That"s right, Lee.
Defeated you.

711
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,819
I mean, lots of British entertainers
who have gone out there...

712
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,510
and they were great,
talented people.

713
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,485
Great entertainers, you know?
Big stars.

714
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:50,057
Much loved, you know, like me.

715
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,896
But, you know, they were as
welcome as a radioactive dog turd!

716
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:57,831
There"s nothing radioactive
about our Lee!

717
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:02,399
Lee, you see, over here,
in this country...

718
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:07,634
you have a greater appeal with the
lower working middle classes.

719
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:10,813
And the mistake you made
is assuming...

720
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:14,878
that the same groups
were gonna like you over there.

721
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:20,313
You see, you pitched
yourself too low, Lee.

722
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:23,882
You"re a Vegas performer.
Vegas!

723
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:29,290
Vegas is where you belong.
Do you hear what l"m saying?

724
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:31,859
Vegas!

725
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:35,196
- Las Vegas?
- Right, Las Vegas.

726
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:37,965
But it all has to be managed right!

727
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:41,234
It all has to be
carefully coordinated.

728
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:46,177
We have to contour you with
the shape of the American media.

729
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:48,384
You see?

730
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:54,285
Look, Moe Greenbaum,
at the Sands Hotel...

731
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:56,788
is an old school chum of mine.

732
00:54:57,027 --> 00:55:00,485
We go way back!
He knows how to handle this!

733
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:02,865
You know people like that?!

734
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:06,661
Lt"s not what you know,
but who you know, right?

735
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:11,606
- You could be bigger than Elvis.
- Bigger than Jesus, lad.

736
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:15,141
Can you imagine how big Jesus would
be if only he could play the guitar?

737
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:22,211
- Vegas.
- Vegas...

738
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:27,322
Let me teach you a little something.
Repeat after me. "Maitre d"".

739
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:28,582
"Maitre d"".

740
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:31,022
- Lock the door.
- Lock the door.

741
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:33,252
No one"s going home tonight.

742
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:36,023
No one"s going home tonight.

743
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:39,460
- Vegas.
- Now what the fuck is a "Maitre d""?

744
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:06,218
L"m going to have to edit this very
carefully for an American audience.

745
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:09,361
That"s my twelve
basic English routines...

746
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:13,798
and this is my loose material, what
I call "My Pick and Mix" file.

747
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:17,495
- Very expensive, dear.
- Very expensive.

748
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:21,540
Well, l"m sure it"s not
all money gone to waste.

749
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:26,041
L"m going to have my man
in New York, Shecky Green...

750
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:28,444
send me the work scripts...

751
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:31,882
of all the top comics
and singers in America.

752
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:34,047
Grand. Just grand.

753
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:37,892
The other night, when we met,
gentlemen, I said to myself...

754
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:42,030
"Stanley, either you can
press ahead with the remake...

755
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:45,395
of Otto Preminger"s
"Samson and Delilah"...

756
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:49,899
or you can lend a helping hand
a British comedian...

757
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:52,040
who needs a States side break.

758
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:56,372
If you can"t lend a hand to a close
friend, then who can you lend it to?

759
00:56:57,647 --> 00:57:00,172
I seem to have run out of vodka.

760
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:10,254
Here"s to Las Vegas.

761
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:14,720
And here"s to Lee Pratt,
the British singer, comedian...

762
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,525
who"s gonna set the States on fire!

763
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:21,431
Here"s to my friend, the famous
film director and fixer...

764
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:25,534
- Stanley Kubrick.
- L"ll drink to that.

765
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,143
Vegas.

766
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:42,309
Ah, here we are.

767
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,612
Compliments of the hotel,
naturally.

768
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:52,060
If you have a short of inspiration,
look out across that bay.

769
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:56,526
I nearly once made a film here.

770
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:58,599
Oh, did you hear that, Cyril?

771
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:00,632
Stanley could"ve put you
on the international map.

772
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:02,930
Well, I hope Mr. Kubrick
will reconsider that film.

773
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:06,806
If it does, it will have
to star our Lee.

774
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:11,407
Yes. I left my heart in Devon, eh?
I left my heart in Devon.

775
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:13,813
Very good, Mr. Pratt.

776
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:16,679
Thank you, Cyril.
Now, Cyril...

777
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,877
Mr. Kubrick is my special guest.

778
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:20,953
I want you to look after him
the way you look after me.

779
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:22,351
Certainly, Mr. Pratt.

780
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,993
Everything Mr. Kubrick wants
Mr. Kubrick should have.

781
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:26,525
Of course, Mr. Pratt.

782
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:29,926
I once had controlling interest
in a hotel...

783
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:32,124
on Fifth Avenue, in New York.

784
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:35,329
But it wasn"t
as nearly well run as here.

785
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:39,341
Thank you, Mr. Kubrick.
Thank you.

786
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:41,702
Well, lovies,
l"ve got a show to produce.

787
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:44,072
Stanley, if you need me, l"ll be
just down the end of the corridor.

788
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:49,047
I have to run and call Shecky
and start on these work scripts.

789
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:51,643
Las Vegas!

790
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:53,816
Here we come.

791
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:22,075
I tell you, I don"t know
what happened last night.

792
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:24,906
It must have been
the sea food in lunch time.

793
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,906
But you"re alright now?

794
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:29,048
Oh, perfect. Never felt better.

795
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:31,948
- Ready to go!
- Oh, great, Stanley, great.

796
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:36,889
Gentlemen, listen. Last night,
I spoke with Shecky in New York.

797
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:41,530
I said, "Shecky, you gotta be ready
to get on the 1st plane to Vegas".

798
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:45,063
Also, he"s meeting Moe there.
I fully briefed the both of them.

799
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:48,795
I told them, "Gentlemen, I want
an absolutely up-to-date report...

800
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:52,736
on everything that"s happening
in every hotel and theater.

801
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:54,636
Vegas! I can"t believe it!

802
01:01:55,611 --> 01:02:00,913
What... schedule
are you thinking about then?

803
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:04,551
I get your point, Norman.
Here"s my thinking at the present.

804
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:07,780
A, we need a lot of
lead time for publicity.

805
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:12,356
B, selected personal
appearances before opening.

806
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:14,663
What have we got
in the book there, Norm?

807
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:17,362
Slack season, you"re resting...

808
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,198
apart from opening a hospice
in Wolverhampton...

809
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:22,731
a charity night in Preston and...

810
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:24,531
taking your mom on holiday.

811
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:27,873
Well...

812
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:30,739
fuck the hospice,
fuck the charity...

813
01:02:30,947 --> 01:02:33,040
and mom"s always wanted
to do Vegas.

814
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:37,451
Now, gentleman,
I may have to fly out ahead...

815
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:40,053
and make sure everything
goes smoothly.

816
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:44,352
But, Norman, I wanna tell you, l"m
making my executive jet available.

817
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:45,891
Handsome.

818
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:47,790
Just handsome.

819
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:55,803
No calls for New York or Vegas
from Mr. Kubrick"s suite?

820
01:02:57,273 --> 01:03:02,472
No. But most of our guests prefer
the use of their personal mobiles.

821
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:09,844
Right.
Right. Interesting.

822
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:19,053
Come in.

823
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:28,137
Shall I leave it here as it is, sir,
or shall I prepare the table?

824
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:33,202
Oh... Just leave it there, "garçon",
and l"ll help myself.

825
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:36,979
That is a double helping
of coq-au-vin, isn"t it?

826
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,545
Yes, it is, sir.

827
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:41,509
And my bottle of vodka?

828
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:45,650
Yes, sir.

829
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:50,754
Lovely. And the cigarettes.
I can"t see the cigarettes.

830
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,052
The cigarretes?

831
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:56,857
Yes, I ordered a carton of 200
cigarettes. Where might that be?

832
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:58,999
L"ll fetch them right away, sir.

833
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:00,562
Young man...

834
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:06,273
once upon a time, I was directing
a movie called "Spartacus".

835
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:12,305
And there was a very young "Miss"
Kirk Douglas playing the title role.

836
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:14,310
And one day...

837
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:19,710
the waiter forgot to bring "Miss"
Kirk Douglas "her" cigarettes.

838
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:24,892
And "Miss" Douglas, being
the shit that "she" is, fired him!

839
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:30,294
That waiter never worked
in Hollywood again.

840
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:33,602
How very tragic, sir.

841
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:41,299
His number one fan!

842
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:47,171
- Another scooter of sherry, Lee.
- Leave that to me, Mrs. V.

843
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:52,117
Gargoyle? Can I have another
junery thing of Cyprus for Mrs. V?

844
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:56,421
2 large scooters of Cyprus and we
haven"t even ordered starters yet.

845
01:04:56,826 --> 01:04:59,351
Tell you what,
you"re the best cheer leader...

846
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:02,156
anyone could ever wish. And you"re
worth your weight in gold lame.

847
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:03,662
Gold lame.

848
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:07,959
She"s like a mother to me. A mother.
Someone you can always rely on.

849
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:10,871
Tell me, Mr. "Kuteprick"...

850
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:13,505
Kubrick.

851
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:18,342
Lee tells me you"re going to make him
very famous in the United States.

852
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:21,949
- That"s the plan.
- Lee says you make pictures...

853
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:24,286
- films.
- Yes, I do.

854
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:28,147
Have you ever made any films
with anyone famous?

855
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:31,121
You know, film stars,
Mr. "Kuteprick"?

856
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:35,820
Kirk Douglas, James Mason...

857
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:38,292
Greta Garbo...

858
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:41,933
Ava Gardner...

859
01:05:43,339 --> 01:05:46,103
and that Funicello.

860
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,510
So you never made
any carry-on films then?

861
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:54,574
No.

862
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:58,651
Well, then, dear, you"ve got
something to look forward to.

863
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:10,894
Well, that"s my done. L"m up the
wooden hill to "Bed-for-sure".

864
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:16,734
Oh, God. And you, Mrs. Vitali?

865
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:21,767
That was a lovely meal.
We must come here again.

866
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:24,008
Oh, that we will.
Come on.

867
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:32,786
Oh, she"s a riot, isn"t she?
Fucking hell!

868
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,630
Where are you going then?

869
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:44,726
Just going.

870
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:51,167
I thought, seeing all the hospitality
you"ve enjoyed courtesy or Lee...

871
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:54,241
that when his
number one fan came down...

872
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:58,169
you might show him gratitude
by paying the bill yourself.

873
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:04,143
It seems to me the least you could
do in the circumstances, old son.

874
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:13,319
Thank you very much.

875
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:17,557
Thank you very much.

876
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:24,403
Norman, that is...
That is a wonderful idea.

877
01:07:41,757 --> 01:07:43,122
Oh, Mr. Prett.

878
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:49,463
L"m sorry to call you down so late.

879
01:07:49,765 --> 01:07:51,926
It"s all right, Cyril.
We weren"t asleep, were we?

880
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:57,362
No. All is well with the world, the
concerts are sold out completely.

881
01:07:57,573 --> 01:07:58,972
Viva Las Vegas.

882
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:00,739
It"s about...

883
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:04,138
Mr. Kubrick.

884
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:05,946
Stan, the man.

885
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:09,547
This afternoon, after
Mr. Kubrick left his room...

886
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:12,482
to visit the Starlight
Spa & Sauna in our basement...

887
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:16,855
Maria Teresa, a most
trustworthy Filipino cleaner...

888
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:21,353
and I cannot tell you
how hard they are to get...

889
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:23,655
went to his room
to do the cleaning...

890
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:28,034
and discovered a number
of magazines in the courtesy bar.

891
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:31,569
Well, let"s hope it was
"Celebrity Monthly", featuring me.

892
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:35,009
These magazines
featured young men...

893
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:41,173
naked young men,
performing explicit acts...

894
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:45,312
upon each other and in groups.

895
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:51,720
The sort of acts, I believe, that
were popular in Sodom and Gomorra.

896
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:56,158
Riding and hove, you mean?
They were having a gay ole time.

897
01:08:56,532 --> 01:09:00,127
Maria Teresa, a most innocent
devout Catholic, went into shock...

898
01:09:00,536 --> 01:09:03,061
and is receiving counseling
as we speak.

899
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:06,730
I was called, and I discovered
amongst these magazines...

900
01:09:06,942 --> 01:09:10,173
personal items,
including a passport.

901
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:13,815
A passport not in the name
of Stanley Kubrick...

902
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:17,610
but in the name
of Alan Conway, a gentleman.

903
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:20,880
So, Mr. Bates, our director
of security, discovered...

904
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:26,027
much to the shog of everyone
at the South Coast Hotels limited...

905
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:29,456
to be a proven confidence man.

906
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:42,102
- There must be some mistake.
- None whatsoever, l"m afraid.

907
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:54,378
Oh, goodness, no...
Fucking.

908
01:09:57,459 --> 01:10:00,724
Would you like to see
one of these magazines?

909
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:11,468
Who is it?

910
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:12,834
<i>Lt"s me.</i>

911
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:24,280
Come in.

912
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:32,855
How"s it going, "Stanley"?

913
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:40,501
Well, really I was speaking
to the "David Letterman Show".

914
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:45,370
And they were saying that they...

915
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:47,974
can"t wait for you to come on.

916
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:49,508
They can"t wait.

917
01:10:50,112 --> 01:10:53,775
I think you and I
need a bit of a chat.

918
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:57,675
Let go of me!

919
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:07,461
I can"t swim!

920
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:53,234
What"s that smell?

921
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:56,442
Have you had one
of your floozies over?

922
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:59,876
Yeah. Sorry about that.
I had Sharon round.

923
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:01,947
We got a bit carried away.

924
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:06,110
I don"t want to find any stains,
any deposits.

925
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:07,482
You won"t.

926
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:10,420
We did it inside bin bags
on polythene, all right?

927
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:15,390
- Oh, yeah, some journalist phoned.
- Right.

928
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:19,192
He knows all about you and your
tricks. So you"d better watch out.

929
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:21,164
He"s doing some big story on you.

930
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:24,305
- Journalist?
- Yeah, he"s gonna call back.

931
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:27,800
He"s got your number, mate.
Knows all about you.

932
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:30,108
<i>You"re Alan Conway...</i>

933
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:32,712
the guy who goes around
impersonating Stanley Kubrick.

934
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:34,344
<i>L"m sorry, l"m not.</i>

935
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:39,180
Mr. Conway, I have got
independent corroboration.

936
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:42,189
<i>Well, I believe you.</i>

937
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:44,620
<i>I like your voice.</i>

938
01:12:44,827 --> 01:12:46,260
Thank you.

939
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:50,159
Well, Frank Rich has written it up.

940
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:53,392
<i>- You lie!</i>
- No, l"m not lying to you.

941
01:12:53,602 --> 01:12:56,093
L"ve got it here in front of me.
It"s in "The New York Times".

942
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:57,397
<i>About me?</i>

943
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:26,692
<i>Hello?</i>

944
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:28,964
<i>Hello?</i>

945
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:31,070
<i>Mr. Kubrick?</i>

946
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:33,506
<i>Hello?</i>

947
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:45,884
Ah, you"re my audience.

948
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:48,854
You"ve come to see my latest film.

949
01:13:49,057 --> 01:13:50,854
Have they given you
an appointment yet?

950
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:55,493
L"m Stanley Kubrick.
I give the appointments around here.

951
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:58,530
Please, take a seat, Mr. Kubrick.
Do not disturb the other patients.

952
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:02,261
They"re not patients!
They"re my audience!

953
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:05,300
Aren"t you?
Aren"t you all?

954
01:14:05,674 --> 01:14:07,938
Please, tell her!
Tell her!

955
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:11,670
- Lf you"d like to take a seat here.
- Why don"t you tell her?

956
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:15,711
Alan?

957
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:18,549
Alan, it"s me, Sean.

958
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:23,752
Is camera ready now?

959
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:28,926
Has "Miss" Kirk Douglas
left "her" dressing room yet?

960
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:34,129
Alan, this is Dr. Stukeley.
She"s gonna help you.

961
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:37,634
Please, please...

962
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:39,704
take me home now!

963
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:47,209
Please, I missed.
L"ve been a very, very naughty boy.

964
01:14:48,183 --> 01:14:50,276
This man"s condition"s very serious.

965
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:54,250
We need to institutionalize,
I mean, hospitalize him right away.

966
01:14:54,456 --> 01:14:56,048
He requires immediate sedation.

967
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:59,453
Well, can"t you just slip him a few
Valium and get him to a day clinic?

968
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:02,357
If only it was easy as that.
It"s quite beyond that.

969
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:05,326
Quite beyond that.

970
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:10,333
There you are.

971
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:17,270
Shepard"s pie or
change in the hole, love?

972
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:22,513
Why, thank you, my good woman.
By the way, do you know who I am?

973
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:25,312
No, but if you ask the ward
supervisor, she will tell you.

974
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:28,918
L"m Stanley Kubrick.

975
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:30,757
L"m Stanley Kubrick.

976
01:15:31,426 --> 01:15:32,950
L"m Stanley Kubrick.

977
01:15:33,629 --> 01:15:34,994
L"m Stanley Kubrick.

978
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:37,363
How dare you?

979
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:41,400
L"m Stanley Kubrick.
L"m Stanley Kubrick.

980
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:47,566
Will all the Stanleys Kubrick
please be quiet and eat their lunch?

981
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,978
- Did you bring it?
- Did I bring what?

982
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:55,873
The bottle, stupid.

983
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:01,213
You owe me, squire.

984
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:15,467
Never tasted better.

985
01:16:16,338 --> 01:16:19,068
You know, you got me worried
that day they brought you in here.

986
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:21,037
I thought you really had flipped.

987
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:24,872
Well, that"s very good insurance,
you see. But with my...

988
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,707
glamourous
psychiatrist backing me...

989
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:29,440
they would never dare
take this case to court.

990
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:37,648
The moment I woke up this morning,
I knew something was different.

991
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:40,827
I couldn"t put my finger
on exactly what it was...

992
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:44,759
and then I suddenly realized
I had become myself again.

993
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:48,696
My real self.
L"d become Alan again.

994
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:51,439
This may only be
a temporary remission.

995
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:54,336
But we need to keep you here
under close observation.

996
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:57,645
You"re such a good person,
Dr. Stukeley.

997
01:16:57,879 --> 01:17:01,337
You really are a good person.
God bless you.

998
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:06,043
Let us return now to your mother,
Nadja Conova, the famous ballerina.

999
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:11,555
All right, let me just ask you
one simple question.

1000
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:15,324
How come, when Mr. Conway
became Stanley Kubrick...

1001
01:17:15,864 --> 01:17:18,389
it was always in situations
and circumstances...

1002
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,728
where he, Conway,
benefited directly?

1003
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:25,167
Where he was on the take?
On the make?

1004
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:27,205
No, no, becoming Stanley Kubrick...

1005
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:30,242
has cost Mr. Conway
the larger part of his life savings.

1006
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:33,706
Everyone, of course, expected
Mr. Kubrick to be generous...

1007
01:17:33,915 --> 01:17:37,976
being so rich and famous.
And Alan had to live up to that.

1008
01:17:38,186 --> 01:17:40,416
He spent many thousands of pounds.

1009
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:42,521
Most of his life savings gone

1010
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:45,822
Where did you get this from?
From him?

1011
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:50,190
You"re willfully refusing to see the
gravity of Mr. Conway"s condition.

1012
01:17:50,532 --> 01:17:52,796
He"s a victim of mental illness.

1013
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:58,633
Dr. Stukeley, why do you think
he"s saying such hurtful things?

1014
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:04,977
Can it be because he doesn"t want
to see me healing and recovering?

1015
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:07,781
Well, if you believe that,
you"d believe anything.

1016
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:12,152
It was all bullshit.
All oxygen for him.

1017
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:17,921
Everybody felt sorry for him,
took him on his own terms...

1018
01:18:18,126 --> 01:18:19,423
as a victim.

1019
01:18:20,162 --> 01:18:21,254
What?

1020
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:24,623
He appeared on television!

1021
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:29,403
He even got paid
for newspaper articles.

1022
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:32,305
"Sic transit".

1023
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:36,067
Yes, the International
Journal of Psychiatric Studies...

1024
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:39,645
has accepted my case history
study of you for the winter issue.

1025
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:44,243
Oh, that"s wonderful, doctor.
Congratulations. Really.

1026
01:18:44,953 --> 01:18:47,854
But l"m afraid that I must tell
and I must insist on this:

1027
01:18:48,323 --> 01:18:52,692
I couldn"t possibly accept
even the smallest fee.

1028
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:55,222
Unless you thought
it was all right.

1029
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:57,227
Nobody gets a fee. Not even I.

1030
01:18:57,432 --> 01:18:59,229
It is an honor
to be published there.

1031
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:03,968
But would my name and address
be included in the article...

1032
01:19:04,172 --> 01:19:07,073
just in case anyone
should try and contact me?

1033
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:10,005
Alan, patients are never
identified in case histories.

1034
01:19:10,212 --> 01:19:12,009
They"re always given a pseudonym.

1035
01:19:13,315 --> 01:19:15,510
- Not much advantage in that.
- Sorry?

1036
01:19:16,284 --> 01:19:18,844
I was saying I understand it.

1037
01:19:19,354 --> 01:19:23,415
Now, we must address ourselves your
last and, I say, lingering problem.

1038
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:26,185
My lack of cash.

1039
01:19:26,628 --> 01:19:30,029
- I was referring to your alcoholism.
- Oh, that?

1040
01:19:30,332 --> 01:19:33,199
L"ve decided to send you on an
alcoholic rehabilitation course...

1041
01:19:33,401 --> 01:19:36,131
for four weeks,
to the Rimini Clinic.

1042
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:41,068
The Rimini Clinic?

1043
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:46,905
The Rimini Clinic?

1044
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:52,314
But I read about it in a magazine
I bought at the supermarket.

1045
01:19:52,521 --> 01:19:58,221
That"s where the famous people, and
film and rock stars go to dry out.

1046
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:01,190
<i>It has a success rate of 95%.</i>

1047
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:03,829
<i>But I can"t afford to stay there.</i>

1048
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:07,597
<i>The National Health Services has</i>
<i>4 placements a year there and...</i>

1049
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,395
<i>you"ll be one of them.</i>

1050
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:13,731
<i>But, Dr. Stukeley,</i>
<i>I don"t deserve to go there.</i>

1051
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:17,370
<i>It"s essential.</i>
<i>You"re recovering, healing.</i>

1052
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:19,911
<i>That"s true.</i>

1053
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:26,616
<i>Would I get some sort of allowance</i>
<i>while l"m in there, doctor?</i>

1054
01:20:27,622 --> 01:20:29,487
<i>Well, we can discuss that later.</i>

1055
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:35,792
<i>L"ll be surrounded</i>
<i>by rich and famous people.</i>

1056
01:20:38,233 --> 01:20:40,064
<i>L"d be in lock down.</i>

1057
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:44,096
<i>How will I cope?</i>

1058
01:20:45,305 --> 01:20:51,936
