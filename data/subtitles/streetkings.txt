1
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,710
Yo, dawg.

2
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,378
Konichiwa.

3
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,672
- What?
- Konichiwa.

4
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,008
Konichiwa means:
"What's up?"

5
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:21,929
- So what the fuck's up?
- We know what it means.

6
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,805
You wanna smoke?

7
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,516
Read the paper ??? yourself clean.

8
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,893
Couple of these and you'll be
fucking like beasts.

9
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,771
- Boys like pussy, right?
- Hey!

10
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,526
Yo, do we look like fucking
tweakers (speed addicts) to you?

11
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:39,696
- So you got the shit or not?
Yeah. You?

12
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,623
What the fuck is this?
We said a machine gun.

13
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,959
It is a machine gun.

14
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,128
- The kind you can carry.
- Couldn't get none of those.

15
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,549
This baby's got character,
Korean war vintage.

16
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:00,759
Maybe we mowed down
one of your grand-papa sans,

17
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:03,053
when he was charging the wire
in China.???

18
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,389
Shit, it's fuckin' stuck.

19
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,724
Fuck it! Take it right. 3 large,
($3000) [and it's yours].

20
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,768
Nigger, I drive a $100,000 car.

21
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:12,604
We want your fagotty ass right
or we'll jack (take) it from you.

22
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,606
Cool. Down to insult right now.

23
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:18,485
Konichiwa is Japanese.
It's insulting to Koreans.

24
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,195
How am I supposed to tell
if you can't?

25
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,614
Fuck's that supposed
to mean, white boy?

26
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,034
Means you got eyes like apostrophes,
you dress white, you talk black,

27
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,953
and drive dukes ??? (gay cars).
So how am I supposed to know

28
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,246
what kind of zipperhead

29
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,123
dog-munching thing you are,
if you don't

30
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:32,875
Yo.

31
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,335
You know what the fuck we are?

32
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,754
Yes, you're a couple of
panheads (peasants)...

33
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,673
buyin' a machine gun out of a trunk.

34
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,927
What's up?

35
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,935
- Take him up.
- Get your ass up!

36
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:54,438
Shit.

37
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,273
What do you mean, shit?!

38
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,863
- Konichiwa, bitch.
- Let's go.

39
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,192
Where?

40
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,950
MISSING
[Call Missing Children Hotline]

41
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,673
(Shit!)

42
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:57,514
It' okay.
I'm a cop.

43
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,748
Captain Wander, congratulations on
breaking the case.

44
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,249
Can you tell me how
you've found the twins?

45
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,252
Truly, my people turned this city
upside down, looking for these girls.

46
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,630
I could not be prouder of my men.

47
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,507
Ma'am, excuse me.

48
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,635
How can you shoot a guy
taking a dump?

49
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:36,386
I mean, seriously, that's sacred.

50
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,055
That's like shooting
the man in a church.

51
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:39,264
Or a Dodger game.

52
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:42,351
Whatever it takes to be a hero,
any time, any place, right, Lud?

53
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,060
I guess so...

54
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,062
I hate these slit-eyed
kiddy-raping bastards.

55
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,523
At least kidnap some full-grown
ladies with shapes.

56
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:50,067
Wow. Maybe we should check his
closet next, eh, Lud?

57
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,736
The girls are being examined by
a physician right now.

58
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:55,822
Both twins are in good health

59
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:58,408
and will be reunited
with their family shortly.

60
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,911
L.A. Times front page tomorrow
is gonna say:

61
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,747
"Vice detective rescues missing twins."

62
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,376
Detective.
Singular.

63
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,128
Yeah, maybe we've been sittin'
around on our asses and doin' jack shit

64
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:11,547
- and all during the last month.
- Hey!

65
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:14,091
You two cut the shit.
The boss is on his way right now.

66
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,634
I mean, you could've
just saved some for us.

67
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:16,969
[What do you want], Santos?

68
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:19,555
You wanna see their faces every night?
You wanna be a killer?

69
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,348
You know what? Shut the fuck up!

70
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,725
Hey, what the hell is going on?
Hey!

71
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:25,310
This is real professional.

72
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,896
What if I walk in here
with the chief? Huh?

73
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,568
Santos, go get your ass outside.

74
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,069
Find Ted Berman and make sure

75
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,863
that that crime scene lot
is in order.

76
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:37,447
- Yes, sir.
- Ride along, boy.

77
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,157
- Shut the fuck up.
- Hey, secure that bullshit, right?

78
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,033
Both of you.

79
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:43,537
Clady, you take DeMille back
to the ward and start writing.

80
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,165
I want something to red-pin by midnight.

81
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,209
Tell your buddy he's
gonna do his writing.

82
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:50,669
Got it captain. Let's go.

83
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,386
This is crazy.

84
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,851
You fucked 'em up.

85
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,146
This is beautiful.

86
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,607
And that machine gun shit,
that was perfect.

87
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,903
I know you hate to wait,
but it's better this way.

88
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,989
- You all right?
- Yeah.

89
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,033
- I got shot.
- Yeah, but you're okay?

90
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:23,118
Yeah. I'm okay, Jack.

91
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:27,706
Because I know you're not tripping
about these...these assholes, right?

92
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,625
Fuck, it's cool.

93
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,920
You were toe to toe with evil,
and you won.

94
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:35,255
You saved those girls.

95
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,257
This is lovely, Tommy.

96
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:40,135
Come here, man.
Give me a hug.

97
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:41,595
Come on.

98
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:48,852
- Not so tight.
- What are you hiding from?

99
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,813
You've been drinking.

100
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,692
You know, that thing
they say about vodka?

101
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,319
That you can't smell it?

102
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,862
It's bullshit.

103
00:12:58,987 --> 00:12:59,863
The D.A. (district attorney)...

104
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,448
shooting team is in rut
right now (do their job).

105
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:03,659
And you're not ready
for public consumption.

106
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:06,870
So...come on, I wanna
get you to a hospital.

107
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,622
Get you away from all of this.

108
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,041
Thanks, Jack.

109
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,099
If that aint L.A.'s deadliest white boy.

110
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:30,310
Aren't you on the wrong side
of the yellow tape?

111
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,522
Congrats on four more notches
for your gun butt.

112
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:36,024
I'll be praying for
the families of your victims.

113
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:38,235
They're called "suspects."

114
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,571
The victims are the
14-year old school girls...

115
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,490
the suspects kept in a cage
and sold to chicken hawks (paedophiles)

116
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:45,742
to poke prod (harrass)
put on the Internet.

117
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:48,704
"Suspects," Washington.
"Suspects."

118
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:53,417
As evil as those men were,
they had a right to trial.

119
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,252
There is gonna be some
blowback (revenge)...

120
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:56,753
from the Korean community on this one.

121
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,548
Now that you're off limits,
why don't you just say it?

122
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,300
You think I'm a racist.

123
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:03,385
- Do you have another explanation?
- No, I don't,

124
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,804
because if I rule and
determine a suspect...

125
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,181
is black, yellow or brown

126
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:09,308
I blow them out of their socks.

127
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:12,186
But if they are white,
I give them a ride home.

128
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:15,314
You know why?
Because I am a racist. Fuck you.

129
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:18,984
Man, I would give you my right arm
to have that shit on tape.

130
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:22,654
What happened to you, Terrence?
We used to be brothers.

131
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:23,947
Hey, hey!

132
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,826
Stay on point, Washington.
You stay on point (focus).

133
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:31,413
Always, Captain Wander.
Always.

134
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:34,875
Tom. Come on,
let's get you out of here.

135
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:40,130
Don't go near that piece of shit.

136
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,632
He's got it coming, Jack.

137
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,842
Do not go near him.
Stay away, far away.

138
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:46,470
- Fuck him.
- That's an order.

139
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,642
I'm waiting for Nurse Garcia.

140
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:58,398
I did the same thing
with this girl once.

141
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:02,361
She was a waitress at a jazz bar.

142
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,989
I'd sit in her section and
won't let anybody else serve me.

143
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:08,325
If they changed sections,
I'd change tables.

144
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,620
Persistence, that's the key.

145
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,960
Wait a second.

146
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:22,089
You're that cop. You're that--
I've just seen your face on TV.

147
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:26,051
You rescued those
Korean twins, right?

148
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,597
Are you okay?
Did you get shot?

149
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,851
No.
Yeah.

150
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,895
How about you?

151
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,107
Me? I sell insurance.
Life, auto, casualty.

152
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,068
That was some heavy shit, man.

153
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,572
So those guys, they shot first, right?

154
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,741
Excuse me?

155
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:52,035
The whole city was looking
for those kids.

156
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:58,667
- How'd you find them?
- That's my job.

157
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:05,048
Excuse me, Captain.
Sorry to interrupt.

158
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:08,969
Deputy Chief ??? is trying to raise you
on the simplex (radio).

159
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:12,306
Insurance, Tom.
I sell insurance.

160
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:18,061
If you ever need any,
and you will,

161
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,813
why don't you give me a call?

162
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:24,067
No one has to know but us.
Not Clady, not Wander, no one.

Listen, for your own good...

165

Don't get yourself so far out there
that I can't reel you back.

166
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,372
See you sometime.

- Nobody, Grace.

- Hi.
- Hi.

171
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:01,605
Hold this.

You know, you can just
stop by sometime.

173
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:08,529
You don't have to get shot
when you want to see me.

174
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,739
Why? I like it like this.

175
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:12,366
Don't you?

176
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:13,951
No, I don't.

177
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:16,161
I don't.

178
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:18,247
No.????

179
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,583
I work here. I'm not losing
my license for you.

180
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,878
- I am a cop.
- No.

181
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:33,011
I keep the door open after
identifying myself as a police officer.

182
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:34,555
Upon entry, I was fired upon

183
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:37,558
by a suspect in the living room
with a silver automatic.

184
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:40,018
I returned fire,
he goes down.

185
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,397
Then I'm hit in the torso by shotgun
fire from the second suspect.

186
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:44,648
Point of entry?

187
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,817
Front door in the
west side of the structure.

188
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:49,027
Why didn't you call
for backup?

189
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:52,114
Exigent (urgent) circumstances.

190
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,533
I heard screams
emanating from the house,

191
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:56,910
and ascertained a crime was in progress.

192
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:28,567
Great work you did there.
Thanks a lot.

193
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,195
Now it's a party.

194
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:32,988
Oh my goodness, now it's
a bandage ???, captain.

195
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:33,989
How you doin'?

196
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:37,117
Steady, steady.
Yeah, he's in.

197
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:40,329
What's with you?
Clady give you a 'happy ending'?

198
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,831
Is that any way to address a commander?

199
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,583
Got the call from the
chief this morning.

200
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:45,834
[The promotion] is next week.

201
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,961
Congratulations, boss.

202
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:51,256
We're gonna have the keys to the city.

203
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,509
Do you believe that shit?
They're crowning him king.

204
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:55,802
Let's get a toast to that.
Toast to the king.

205
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:57,513
King Wander.

206
00:18:57,846 --> 00:18:59,473
Yo boss, gotta be your driver
when you make chief?

207
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:01,642
- You got it, you got it if you want.
- All right.

208
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,727
You know, I owe you one, Tom.

209
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:06,438
That pot twins caper,
that gave me the edge.

210
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,024
You know, the chief,
he's breaking tradition.

211
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,150
????

212
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,612
The first commander's slot?? always goes
to the head of Internal Affairs,

213
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:14,655
that's the way it is.

214
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,240
That's because they got
so much dirt on everyone.

215
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:16,823
That's right,

216
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:18,534
and they're always
looking for more, huh?

217
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:21,328
Yeah.

218
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:24,289
You know this prick?

219
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:27,793
Came at me like "Joe Concerned Citizen"
asking procedural questions.

220
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,170
Yeah, we got a history, this--

221
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:33,382
See, if they'd show up
during the daytime,

222
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:34,800
you would know who your enemies are.

223
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,385
What did you tell him?

224
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:38,971
I couldn't help myself clearly,
I told him everything.

225
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:39,805
Atta boy.

226
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:41,974
You know, this is a typical
Biggs bullshit move,

227
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:44,142
???
Backdoor is all they fuckin' got.

228
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,353
Why is Internal Affairs
after my ass all of a sudden?

229
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:47,855
It's Washington, brother.

230
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,565
Your ex-partner is a snitch.

231
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,114
Holy shit.

232
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,950
Jack, talk to me.

233
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,994
Washington has had several meetings...

234
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:04,288
with Captain Biggs over
the last few weeks.

235
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,957
They're no secrets in the department,

236
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:10,878
so when I became cognizant (aware)
of the problem, we threw a tail on him,

237
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:12,963
I followed this guy,
Eastside, Westside, Southside.

238
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,007
Next thing I know, he's ringing Biggs'
doorbell in??? land.

239
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:18,010
Who's Washington given up?
(betrayed)

240
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,891
You, Tom.

241
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:25,267
- Me?
- Yeah.

242
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,060
- Why now?
- Because I shitcanned (fired)

243
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:29,605
him from this unit
and he is a vindictive bastard.

244
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,400
And now he is on a mission
to pull the ??? from under my best guys.

245
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:37,446
All my best guys,
that's what this shit's about.

246
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:40,949
Tommy, Tommy.

247
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:44,203
- That's your life right there.
- I'm just gonna talk to my friend.

248
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:45,537
- No, you 're not. You're not.
- You wanna talk?

249
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,080
Let's talk about my foot up your ass

250
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,541
if you don't sit the fuck down
here on your chair right now.

251
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,044
Have a seat.
Come on.

252
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:55,589
What the fuck is wrong with you?

253
00:20:57,758 --> 00:21:01,386
Do not, and I repeat, do not
hand Washington your badge.

254
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:05,849
I know you two have done some
??? (shit) together,

255
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:08,769
But we gotta hold the line,
you and me.

256
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,438
We've been here before, haven't we?

257
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:13,857
When the gates of hell
opened up on you, Tom.

258
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:16,693
I took care of you then,
I'm gonna take care of you now.

259
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,572
- All right?
- Okay.

260
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,343
Washington.

261
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:08,180
Drop it.
- What are you doing?

262
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:09,806
Do you want to kill me, partner?

263
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:11,558
Are you crazy, we've
got a 211 in Park Rest ???.

264
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:13,477
I got you.
I got you and Wander.

265
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,939
Listen to me, you idiot. We've got two
gang bangers rolling in hot.

266
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:27,741
Shit.

267
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:00,524
Washington.
Stay with me, partner.

268
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,257
- Don't move! Let me see your hands!
- I'm a cop...

269
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:27,634
I'm a cop,
I'm a fucking cop!

270
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:29,344
Fuck.

271
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,722
- It's Ludlow.
- Give me an ambulance now.

272
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:33,432
Holy shit.

273
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,058
He's a cop too?

274
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:37,728
Yeah.

275
00:25:21,897 --> 00:25:23,982
Where's the video?

276
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:49,174
- Who else has seen this?
- Just us, boss.

277
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:50,717
It was a straight 211 that went south.

278
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:52,761
That's not what it was,
that's what it looks like.

279
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:55,138
But it's not what it looks like.
It's not.

280
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:57,140
That's all there is, Tom.

281
00:25:57,766 --> 00:26:00,185
What it looks like.
What everybody sees.

282
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:01,603
You knew that.

283
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:03,105
Right, if anybody in the
department sees this video,

284
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,565
you're no longer a cop,
do you understand that?

285
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,818
The department?
If the D.A. sees this...

286
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:10,404
- he's going to prison.
- Why?

287
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:12,489
Because Washington was
in the wrong place at the wrong time?

288
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:14,283
No, because you were.

289
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:17,870
Washington's problems are over.
Yours are just beginning.

290
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:21,290
Try to think
two moves ahead, for once.

291
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:25,002
Captain Biggs will say that you got
two thugs (criminals) off the street

292
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:27,004
went after a cop who
was diming (selling) you out

293
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:28,797
to Internal Affairs.

294
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:29,840
It writes itself.

295
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:32,009
I was just gonna break his jaw.
- That's a good answer.

296
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:36,013
I gave you a direct order:
Stay away from him.

297
00:26:37,723 --> 00:26:40,267
Give me your goddamn gun.
Now.

298
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:42,978
Give me your goddamn gun.

299
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,402
You don't give a shit about yourself,
that's pretty obvious,

300
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:52,779
but you gotta think about the unit.
You really fucked us on this one.

301
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:55,157
Clady, give me a minute, please.

302
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:57,826
Yes, sir.

303
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:05,292
I can't afford to lose you.

304
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,253
Who would do what you do?

305
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:12,132
You are the tip of the fucking spear.

306
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:17,471
Who's gonna hold back the animals?

307
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:24,937
Maybe...

308
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,398
the clerk...

309
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:33,362
forget to put a disk
in the recorder today.

310
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:39,827
Maybe you were first on the scene, Tom.

311
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:43,413
And you ran to the aid to Washington.

312
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:49,795
Who wanna say...

313
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:56,760
Make some calls.

314
00:27:57,386 --> 00:27:59,096
And me...

315
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:01,849
this shit won't be here

316
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:05,018
when I get back.

317
00:28:57,112 --> 00:28:59,740
He was my partner, back in the day.

318
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:02,201
We were black and white...

319
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:05,329
when black and white
was still a big deal.

320
00:29:05,454 --> 00:29:07,498
White cops wouldn't back us
'cause of him,

321
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:09,958
black cops because of me.

322
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,418
Fuck 'em.

323
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:13,170
We made it.

324
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:18,175
Sorry. You tried to save him,
you did your best.

325
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,471
My best? I was curled up
in a ball (hiding) while he got shot.

326
00:29:22,596 --> 00:29:24,264
We should have dumped those guys.

327
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:27,226
They just wave a pen and
change what happened.

328
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:28,685
Just like that.

329
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:32,397

we can do whatever the hell we want.

It's how we write it up.

331
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,194
What about the truth?

332
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:39,488
What about it?

333
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:43,909
You have to honor him,
your friend.

334
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:45,786
Honor him?

335
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:49,122
I was gonna knock him out
and he thought I was gonna kill him.

336
00:29:49,248 --> 00:29:53,377
- Prick.
- Don't turn your back on him.

I don't want to give you
another dose here, but

345
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:27,077
Got a set of blues (uniform)
still in your locker?

346
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:28,996
- No...
- Here's the thing.

347
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,581
- I gotta bury you.
- Not that.

348
00:30:30,664 --> 00:30:32,541
In a nice politically correct spot.

349
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:34,877
Until this Washington
thing's cooled off a bit.

350
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:36,670
No, Jack.

351
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:40,757
You work is to conduct preliminary
interviews of the [delinquents. ]

352
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:46,555
If there is a specific allegation
against an officer

353
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:49,600
you write it up and forward
it over to Internal Affairs.

354
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:53,270
Now, temptation is to be a good
brother cop.

355
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:58,317
Don't be. Noe of this shit's
going anywhere anyway.

356
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:00,527
There is your desk.

357
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:05,073
Suppose I get a complaint
against myself?

358
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:08,619
Write it up and forward it.

359
00:31:08,744 --> 00:31:11,622
- Okay?
- Okay.

360
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:16,251
[Protecting L.A.'s Future]
[I am the LAPD]

361
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:23,759
Do you have a complaint?

362
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:26,887
Motherfucker beat my ass
like I was Rodney King, man.

363
00:31:27,471 --> 00:31:29,181
Except there wasn't no video.

364
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:32,726
Dude looked just like you,
but black.

365
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:37,564
This ass been working longer than
all the y'all cops disrespecting me.

366
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:39,566
He pulled me out of my
ride, disrespected...

367
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:40,817
me in front of my old lady.

368
00:31:40,943 --> 00:31:43,070
Tried to get her number and shit.

369
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:45,614
Do you have his badge number?
Did you see his name tag?

370
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:48,200
No, with his boot on my throat and
his partner kickin' me...

371
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:49,409
No, it's a little bit difficult.

372
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:51,036
Everyone comes here,
they have a complaint.

373
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,205
They sit down, I've been waiting
here for motherfuckin' 5 hours,

374
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,249
and now you do ask me:
do I have a complaint.

375
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:56,834
Obviously I have a complaint.

376
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:58,627
You know what, this is some bullshit.

377
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:00,212
That's why I hate all
these motherfuckers.

378
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:01,922
Fuck all ya!

379
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:14,351
Wander has got sense of humor,
I give him that.

380
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:16,270
Do you have a complaint?

381
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,564
Where to begin?

382
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:22,776
The black band.

383
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:25,154
Man down.
Hurts, right?

384
00:32:25,571 --> 00:32:28,574
Losing a colleague,
a brother in blue.

385
00:32:28,699 --> 00:32:30,659
I am sorry he's gone, sir.

386
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:33,120
You two worked Vice Special together,

387
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:35,122
pushed the black and
white in the Southend.

388
00:32:35,873 --> 00:32:37,583
"Phonebook Tom."

389
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:40,419
The last of the ghetto gunfighters.

390
00:32:41,587 --> 00:32:44,381
Heard you got your best
confession with a '91 directory.

391
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:47,593
You know Washington was holding
me assholed down.

392
00:32:48,427 --> 00:32:50,012
Is this an interview?

393
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:51,597
Just a little back and forth.

394
00:32:51,722 --> 00:32:53,265
Look, Captain, I'm not much a dancer.

395
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,684
So if there's something
you'd like to ask...

396
00:32:56,602 --> 00:32:59,438
Why don't we go get some lunch, Tom?

397
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:02,816
This is the interview.

398
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:04,359
Regarding yesterday's incident.

399
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:07,404
You were the first on scene, correct?

400
00:33:08,447 --> 00:33:10,157
Yes, sir.

401
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,658
Three shooters, right?

402
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:13,327
Two. Read the report.

403
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:16,079
What would you say if I told you that
the pathologists recovered

404
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:18,874
three different calibres
from Terrence Washington's body?

405
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,377
That sounds like three shooters to me.

406
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:25,214
What are you doing here, Tom?

407
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,971
Come on, man to man.
Tape's off.

408
00:33:35,307 --> 00:33:36,475
Damn it!

409
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,686
It doesn't bother you that
there are two cop killers out there

410
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:42,022
living, laughing, fucking?
It doesn't bother you, Tom?

411
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:44,066
Yes, it bothers me.

412
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,902
So why'd you let them
get away, gunfighter?

413
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:48,987
Hey, let's get something
straight Captain.

414
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:50,113
Nobody's getting away.

415
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:52,449
What happened to the
video from the store?

416
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:55,619
What video?

417
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,454
Listen to me.

418
00:33:57,538 --> 00:34:01,250
Every time you shit in the bed,
Wander's there to change the sheets.

419
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:02,751
Well, not anymore, son.

420
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:04,711
I'm gonna pour gas on you,

421
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:07,923
and I'm gonna pour gas on Wander
and everyone in Vice Special.

422
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:11,552
Then I'm lighting a match
and I'm gonna burn all of you.

423
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:14,555
I tried to save you,
Detective Ludlow.

424
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:16,765
Your windows closed.

425
00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:19,059
And that third shooter?

426
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:21,436
He's mine, so help me God.

427
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:27,860
Get back into your office!

428
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:31,780
<i>Captain, are you still there? </ i></i>

429
00:34:31,864 --> 00:34:33,532
I'll call you back.

430
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,910
What the fuck are you
doing in my office?

431
00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:39,580
What the fuck are you doing,
jamming my people at lunch?

432
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:42,207
If you got a problem with Ludlow,
you come to me.

433
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:44,668
You keep your dog on a leash.

434
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:46,920
Everybody knows he can't
make a move without you.

435
00:34:47,546 --> 00:34:50,215
- You go cry to daddy?
- Stop, right there.

436
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:52,092
Stop.

437
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:55,387
Tom is a damn fine cop.

438
00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:58,932
He bleeds cool.

439
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:02,144
You got an open case on him?

440
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,521
Vice Special?

441
00:35:05,147 --> 00:35:07,024
You got one on me?

442
00:35:07,774 --> 00:35:10,068
You formally investigating us?

443
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:15,073
This is a fishing expedition.

444
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,742
'Cause you know
if you went to the chief,

445
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:17,743
and you asked him

446
00:35:17,868 --> 00:35:20,579
to open a case on me or
anybody on my unit.

447
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:22,080
he would laugh you out of his office.

448
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:23,999
Listen to me, you piece of shit.

449
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:26,627
I watched you intimidate,
bully and blackmail

450
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:29,671
your way up through the
pay grades for 20-plus years.

451
00:35:29,755 --> 00:35:31,924
I know exactly what you are.

452
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:35,427
You got no business being a commander.

453
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:40,098
You like Tom, don't you?

454
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:44,853
I saw the way you watched
him when we came in.

455
00:35:44,937 --> 00:35:47,105
That's why you're following him around.

456
00:35:47,189 --> 00:35:49,191
You want him to give you a blowjob,

457
00:35:49,316 --> 00:35:50,442
Like that hooker I caught...

458
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:52,277
you with when we were
sergeants, remember?

459
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:53,779
Shut up, Jack.

460
00:35:53,904 --> 00:35:57,032
Does your wife know that
you use prostitutes, Jimmy?

461
00:35:59,827 --> 00:36:02,454
That was the best
head (blowjob) I ever had.

462
00:36:02,538 --> 00:36:04,206
What about you, Jack?

463
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:07,209
You always found it hard to keep
your prick out of the ghetto.

464
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:09,753
It's a two-way street, buddy.

465
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:12,089
You can't ride the tiger forever.

466
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:14,424
Now get the hell out of my office.

467
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:19,346
Do the department a favor
and wash your mouth out with buckshot.

468
00:36:19,513 --> 00:36:21,265
(go kill yourself)

469
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:24,059
Come on, Tom.
Let's get out of here.

470
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:32,943
In his time on the street,

471
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:36,780
and through his time in
your schools and homes,

472
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:40,075
Detective Washington was tireless

473
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:44,413
in his devotion to his church,
his love for his family...

474
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:47,291
and his dedication to this department.

475
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:50,878
Uniform detail,
atten-hut!

476
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:55,174
Fire guard,
port arms.

477
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:58,468
Half right, face.

478
00:36:59,845 --> 00:37:02,931
Ready.
Aim! Fire!

479
00:37:03,432 --> 00:37:05,392
Aim!
Fire!

480
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:07,269
Aim!
Fire!

481
00:37:08,437 --> 00:37:11,023
Uniform detail,
present arms!

482
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:40,469
- Go back to work.
- Yes sir.

483
00:37:41,303 --> 00:37:44,389
Let's go get 'em.

484
00:37:44,473 --> 00:37:45,516
Sir.

485
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:01,615
Mrs. Washington?

486
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:08,163
- I was the first scene.
- Yeah, of course you were.

487
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:11,083
Excuse me.

488
00:38:27,808 --> 00:38:29,685
Are you Diskant?

489
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,103
Yeah.

490
00:38:32,563 --> 00:38:34,356
You're working on Washington?

491
00:38:35,274 --> 00:38:36,233
Yeah.

492
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:38,819
You know who I am?

493
00:38:39,153 --> 00:38:40,237
Yes.

494
00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:43,073
Are you not interviewing me?

495
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:46,160
You are on my list.

496
00:38:46,577 --> 00:38:49,163
Let's get rolling.
Where do I start?

497
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:53,625
Gang books, mug shots (photos)?
211 ("robbery") reports?

498
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:56,420
If you want.

499
00:38:56,503 --> 00:38:59,173
Come on, Diskant.
You've worked for homicide before.

500
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:03,427
I'm 242 ("battery": brawls, fights).

501
00:39:04,553 --> 00:39:06,889
Okay, 242.
You got the ballistics report?

502
00:39:06,972 --> 00:39:08,015
No.

503
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,850
The bullets are still at the coroner's.

504
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:12,311
Yeah, but they've given
you updates, right?

505
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:15,272
Did they tell you how many different
calibres they dug out of Washington?

506
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:17,733
- What do you want?
- How many?

507
00:39:22,738 --> 00:39:24,740
Goodbye, detective.

508
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:35,876
Harry, I thought you were dead.

509
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,686
[Department of Coroner]
[Administration Operations]

510
00:39:57,606 --> 00:39:59,274
I'm from Vice Special.

511
00:40:01,777 --> 00:40:04,071
Tom Ludlow.
I know who you are.

512
00:40:04,196 --> 00:40:06,114
I handled your wife's autopsy.

513
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,827
That was you?

514
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:11,787
The asshole, remember?

515
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:13,872
Right.

516
00:40:14,498 --> 00:40:17,209
The guy who washed away all the
hair and fibre evidence.

517
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:20,212
The guy who wouldn't do a vaginal swab.

518
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:23,006
The guy who left me
with nothing to go on.

519
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:25,425
It's not my job to investigate adultery.

520
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:27,803
How can I help you?

521
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:34,601
Pulled these out of Washington?

522
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:37,312
Yep. 18 rounds. Ten .45 calibre...

523
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:40,774
full metal jackets,
seven 9 millimeter FMJs

524
00:40:40,858 --> 00:40:42,359
and a single .38 hollow point...

525
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:44,736
mushroomed against the
scapula (shoulder blade).

526
00:40:44,862 --> 00:40:48,323
Serious overkill.
Must've really pissed off the shooters.

527
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,620
Did you get what you were looking for?

528
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:57,624
I am Detective Diskant, we spoke
on the phone earlier.

529
00:40:57,749 --> 00:41:00,878
- I'm here for the ballistics evidence.
- How're you doing?

530
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:05,257
- When can I expect the report?
- In about an hour, sir.

531
00:41:07,176 --> 00:41:08,427
- Can you fax this to my office?
- Okay.

532
00:41:09,428 --> 00:41:10,554
Thank you, Doc.

533
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:21,190
Diskant, talk to me.

534
00:41:21,273 --> 00:41:24,318
You got three different calibres,
that means three weapons.

535
00:41:25,235 --> 00:41:27,988
What's your take went
on down in that market?

536
00:41:28,822 --> 00:41:30,616
Two bad guys come through the front door...

537
00:41:30,741 --> 00:41:32,618
to rob the place, one
of them sees the clerk,

538
00:41:32,743 --> 00:41:34,161
cut's him in half, the other one sees

539
00:41:34,244 --> 00:41:35,871
Washington, whose weapon
is already drawn,

540
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:38,165
empties his clip into him.

541
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:40,542
His buddy joins the party,
till he runs dry,

542
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:42,211
then one of them pulls a .38,

543
00:41:42,336 --> 00:41:45,339
pumps a final "fuck you"-round
into Washington's back.

544
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:49,384
They leave, you show up
after they're gone.

545
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,555
Got it all figured out.

546
00:41:57,351 --> 00:41:58,185
I got your back here,

547
00:41:58,268 --> 00:42:00,687
but you got to keep your distance
and let me work this case.

548
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:03,649
No one's gonna find these assholes.
Is that what you need to hear from me?

549
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:05,651
Are you fucking kidding me?

550
00:42:06,485 --> 00:42:08,445
They get a pass and you get a pass.
That's the deal, right?

551
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:10,989
What are you talking about,
"the shooters get a pass"?

552
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:13,116
I don't understand.
Clady said you were on board.

553
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,576
Not with this.

554
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:17,246
What is the deal?
You throw in this case for a promotion?

555
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:19,706
If I were you I'd be
more worried about yourself.

556
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:22,417
Hey, you piece of shit! You got a
187 (homicide) on a police officer

557
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:24,503
and you're fucking
lettin' the suspects walk?

558
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:26,380
- You want these guys found?
- That doesn't piss you off?

559
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:28,173
- So they can put you out in the????
- Fuck off!

560
00:42:28,257 --> 00:42:29,341
Place you in the store
before the shooting?

561
00:42:29,424 --> 00:42:31,343
Do you want to catch
a felony for obstruction?

562
00:42:31,426 --> 00:42:33,762
If I say you weren't there,
you weren't there.

563
00:42:35,347 --> 00:42:37,850
This is your mess,
and I'm cleaning it up.

564
00:42:37,975 --> 00:42:39,893
Yeah, it pisses me off.

565
00:42:41,937 --> 00:42:43,105
Diskant.

566
00:42:44,273 --> 00:42:45,357
Yeah.

567
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:48,402
Yes, hang on one second.

568
00:42:52,948 --> 00:42:54,616
All right, go ahead.

569
00:42:55,784 --> 00:42:57,703
All right, thank you.

570
00:42:57,828 --> 00:42:59,163
Bye Bye.

571
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:03,458
You write in codes.

572
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:06,670
The lab found saliva on a cigarette butt
and a bandana outside the store.

573
00:43:07,171 --> 00:43:08,964
The DNA corresponds to those two names.

574
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:11,008
Congratulations, you
I.D. ed the shooters.

575
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:13,093
Yeah, normally I would be pretty happy.

576
00:43:13,218 --> 00:43:15,512
Pull the rep sheets. Give me copies.

577
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,723
I'll see you around.

578
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:26,982
The computer says you
arrested these guys.

579
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:30,277
Fremont and Coates.

580
00:43:31,403 --> 00:43:33,447
Good guys.
Say hi from me.

581
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:34,990
Do you remember them?

582
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:36,533
Who can forget?

583
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:39,203
Heroin dealers with a
taste for blood.

584
00:43:39,828 --> 00:43:43,665
Came up from Belize to make a sale
and they liked the Southland so much.

585
00:43:43,749 --> 00:43:44,750
They never left.

586
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:48,128
Yeah, we hooked these fine gentlemen
on a rape/mutilation caper.

587
00:43:48,962 --> 00:43:50,923
It seems they had a
three day hostage fest

588
00:43:51,048 --> 00:43:52,966
with this cute little Guatemalan chick.

589
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:55,969
They snatched her up
when she was walking over from school.

590
00:43:56,053 --> 00:43:57,095
Hurt her bad.

591
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:59,765
- Then why are they on the streets?
- They walked from the ????.

592
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,391
One of our own felt we violated

593
00:44:01,517 --> 00:44:03,560
Mr. Coates' and Mr.
Fremont's civil rights

594
00:44:03,977 --> 00:44:05,646
and told the city attorney.

595
00:44:06,063 --> 00:44:07,981
- Washington dimed you out.
- Yeah.

596
00:44:09,316 --> 00:44:11,860
Why do you think they put that dude
community relations?

597
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:13,487
Are you shittin' me?

598
00:44:13,612 --> 00:44:16,406
Washington kicked loose
the very guys who whacked him?

599
00:44:16,532 --> 00:44:18,283
Damn ironic, isn't it?

600
00:44:19,243 --> 00:44:21,954
Hello, guys.
What is this, a garage sale?

601
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:24,915
Hello, Lud?
What's this?

602
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,416
Why...uh...

603
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,919
Why do you have this?

604
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:31,421
Those are the shitbags
who popped Washington.

605
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,131
Sarge, we can get these guys.

606
00:44:33,215 --> 00:44:35,926
No, no.
Not if you want to keep your badge.

607
00:44:36,343 --> 00:44:37,427
Besides, these two animals?

608
00:44:37,511 --> 00:44:38,929
These guys,
they'll take care of each other.

609
00:44:39,054 --> 00:44:40,305
They'll be dead by the end of the week.

610
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,807
Probably shoot
each other's fucking faces off.

611
00:44:41,932 --> 00:44:42,975
no one needs to.

612
00:44:43,058 --> 00:44:44,142
You know how this shit it works.

613
00:44:44,268 --> 00:44:46,520
This week's suspect,
next week's victims.

614
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,438
Right?

615
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:51,150
Yeah, right.

616
00:45:05,873 --> 00:45:08,625
- What are you doing here, Tom?
- Let's talk.

617
00:45:23,473 --> 00:45:25,184
I'm sick of this shit, man.

618
00:45:25,601 --> 00:45:28,020
It's the same damn song for three years.

619
00:45:28,103 --> 00:45:30,105
Crying about your wife.

620
00:45:30,397 --> 00:45:32,191
She's gone, Tom.

621
00:45:33,025 --> 00:45:35,736
What's it going to take
to bring you back from Mars?

622
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,157
Have I ever asked you for anything?

623
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,117
You know what,
you ask me for shit all the time.

624
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:43,952
Big things, Jack?

625
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:45,954
Important things.

626
00:45:46,038 --> 00:45:47,706
What's up, Tom?

627
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:49,333
Give me a green light to...

628
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:51,627
take out the assholes
who did Washington.

629
00:45:52,169 --> 00:45:55,214
Come on, Jack.
King's X. (time-out, truce)

630
00:45:56,757 --> 00:45:58,342
What the hell is this?

631
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:01,595
I can lay them out like
I did those Koreans, but off the books.

632
00:46:02,012 --> 00:46:03,764
I'm talking shovels and trash bags.

633
00:46:04,097 --> 00:46:05,891
Who's going to know?
Who's going to care?

634
00:46:05,974 --> 00:46:07,684
The Koreans...

635
00:46:08,101 --> 00:46:09,686
that was business.

636
00:46:10,312 --> 00:46:11,647
This is some crazy bullshit...

637
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,816
wrapped around in that
drunk ass mind of yours.

638
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:15,984
Look at yourself.

639
00:46:16,109 --> 00:46:18,529
Look at yourself Tom, you're a mess!

640
00:46:20,197 --> 00:46:21,990
When did you start drinking today?

641
00:46:22,407 --> 00:46:24,368
You're little airplane bottles of vodka.

642
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:26,328
And you drove over here intoxicated.

643
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:27,788
You want a second DUI?
(driving under influence)

644
00:46:27,913 --> 00:46:29,540
No one's going to fuck with me, Jack!

645
00:46:29,832 --> 00:46:30,916
You're not listening to me!

646
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:32,501
You're not listening to me!

647
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:34,419
No, you listen to me.

648
00:46:35,254 --> 00:46:37,881
This is much bigger than that.

649
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:41,426
Do you think Biggs is stupid?

650
00:46:41,844 --> 00:46:44,304
He has a PhD in catching cops slipping.

651
00:46:45,764 --> 00:46:49,142
You know this.
You know all this.

652
00:46:49,434 --> 00:46:51,436
You gotta hold your mud (stay strong).

653
00:46:52,062 --> 00:46:53,605
Can you do that?

654
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:57,818
It's time to turn the page
and close the book.

655
00:47:08,662 --> 00:47:10,372
They took $200.

656
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:13,750
I had forgotten about this
until I saw this.

657
00:47:14,877 --> 00:47:16,670
That's the man.

658
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:18,922
That's him.

659
00:47:19,673 --> 00:47:23,427
They took all my pay.
Said it was for the cookie jar.

660
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,889
The cookie jar.

661
00:47:27,222 --> 00:47:28,974
That's what he said.

662
00:47:32,978 --> 00:47:34,646
I'll be right back.

663
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:51,413
What do you want, Disco?

664
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,210
Washington was dirty.
He was a piece of shit.

665
00:48:00,172 --> 00:48:01,965
Why are you telling me this?

666
00:48:02,174 --> 00:48:03,926
I think you know why.

667
00:48:05,177 --> 00:48:06,929
I know why.

668
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:12,267
- Got it in this? Huh?
- That's a new phone.

669
00:48:12,392 --> 00:48:14,561
You're working for Internal Affairs.

670
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:17,648
You made one deal,
maybe you made two?

671
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:20,734
Did Captain Biggs
flip you to the dark side, punk?

672
00:48:22,194 --> 00:48:23,862
You know what?

673
00:48:25,864 --> 00:48:29,076
They're right about you.
You are fucking out there (mad).

674
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:32,663
From now on you stay away from me.
We don't talk.

675
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:35,958
Hold on, Disco.
Hold on.

676
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,336
I gotta watch my own back
these days, you know?

677
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:42,506
Come on.
Don't be mad.

678
00:48:42,631 --> 00:48:44,466
Washington was dirty.

679
00:48:46,468 --> 00:48:49,763
Hit me, princess.
Come on.

680
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:52,891
Couple of things.

681
00:48:53,517 --> 00:48:56,019
You know, we found $50,000 in cash
??? at the store?

682
00:48:56,144 --> 00:48:59,273
No, I didn't. That's a lot of cash
but not in itself damning.

683
00:48:59,439 --> 00:49:01,358
Oh, but this is.

684
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:02,860
Looks like an evidence tag.

685
00:49:02,985 --> 00:49:04,236
I found it in Washington's truck.

686
00:49:04,361 --> 00:49:06,029
I had SID (Scientific
Investigation Division)...

687
00:49:06,155 --> 00:49:07,573
scan it, corresponds
to a kilo of heroin.

688
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:10,492
Guess who comes along
and signs up the dope?

689
00:49:10,576 --> 00:49:12,077
Washington.

690
00:49:12,161 --> 00:49:15,122
Washington signed out heroin
and returned brown sugar.

691
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:20,210
Guys who worked (killed) him moved dope.

692
00:49:21,378 --> 00:49:24,756
You know, Washington sprung them from
a rape [charge] on a technicality.

693
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,466
No, I did not know that.

694
00:49:26,592 --> 00:49:29,178
Maybe they had a business arrangement.

695
00:49:29,803 --> 00:49:31,555
Maybe it was a hit?
(assassination)

696
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,807
That would explain
the heavy artillery.

697
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:38,395
Washington deserved it, right?

698
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,689
He was dirty, so fuck him.

699
00:49:41,815 --> 00:49:43,817
I feel much better
about the suspects walking,

700
00:49:43,942 --> 00:49:47,362
And you must feel better, too, right?
We're doing the right thing.

701
00:49:50,908 --> 00:49:53,076
No shame if you want to take your pass.

702
00:49:58,332 --> 00:50:00,209
This has to be you and me.

703
00:50:02,336 --> 00:50:04,588
Why do you think we're
in the goddamn bathroom?

704
00:50:26,693 --> 00:50:29,196
This is it. The last known address.

705
00:50:45,295 --> 00:50:46,755
We are cops.

706
00:50:47,673 --> 00:50:48,799
Do you live here?

707
00:50:48,924 --> 00:50:50,133
How long have you been living here?

708
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,426
Three months.

709
00:50:52,511 --> 00:50:53,637
Who's living with you?

710
00:50:53,762 --> 00:50:57,808
My mum, my dad, my sisters and brothers
and my cousin Grisella.

711
00:50:57,891 --> 00:50:59,059
No one else?

712
00:51:03,897 --> 00:51:05,149
Okay.

713
00:51:08,944 --> 00:51:11,947
Family or not.
Our boys are long gone.

714
00:51:13,949 --> 00:51:15,659
All right, Disco.

715
00:51:16,285 --> 00:51:18,871
See those yahoos (idiots)?
I'm gonna jam 'em.

716
00:51:18,954 --> 00:51:20,998
And when I do,
one of them is gonna bolt (run).

717
00:51:21,123 --> 00:51:22,499
That's the one that has to do it.

718
00:51:23,876 --> 00:51:25,460
Are you bored or something?

719
00:51:26,086 --> 00:51:27,421
This is their (neighbor)hood.

720
00:51:27,546 --> 00:51:29,590
If anyone knows Fremont
and Coates, they do.

721
00:51:32,885 --> 00:51:35,429
- Fuck it.
- Look at those guys.

722
00:51:42,394 --> 00:51:44,146
Get him.

723
00:51:49,568 --> 00:51:51,653
Suck on my balls!

724
00:51:52,821 --> 00:51:55,866
Go home.
You're in the wrong neighborhood.

725
00:51:59,703 --> 00:52:01,371
Watch out!

726
00:52:08,337 --> 00:52:10,130
Run, amigo.

727
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:33,654
Spencer.

728
00:53:15,112 --> 00:53:16,780
I had him.

729
00:53:18,407 --> 00:53:20,033
Why are you running, man?

730
00:53:20,117 --> 00:53:23,078
Get me the fuck down here.
I just????.

731
00:53:24,746 --> 00:53:27,708
- Get me the fuck down, man.
- What else?

732
00:53:29,084 --> 00:53:31,420
What the fuck are you doing, man?

733
00:53:32,629 --> 00:53:34,339
So what do they call you?

734
00:53:34,423 --> 00:53:36,425
They call me fucking Quicks, man.

735
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,802
"Quicks"?
Not quick enough.

736
00:53:39,136 --> 00:53:41,847
Hey, get me the fuck down.
This meshes are cutting me up.

737
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:44,141
Fremont and Coates, they used to live...

738
00:53:44,224 --> 00:53:46,894
across from where you were
partying at. You know them?

739
00:53:47,102 --> 00:53:49,354
I don't fucking know the fools, man.

740
00:53:49,438 --> 00:53:51,023
I 'm a fucking Southsider, right?

741
00:53:51,148 --> 00:53:53,358
I won't fuck nobody with
my brothers and shit.

742
00:53:53,692 --> 00:53:54,776
Hey, what the fuck you doin'?

743
00:53:54,902 --> 00:53:56,069
They're from Belize.

744
00:53:56,153 --> 00:53:58,322
Who knows them?
Who knows them?

745
00:53:58,405 --> 00:53:59,573
Who knows them?!

746
00:54:01,658 --> 00:54:03,118
Look, look.
Check this out, man.

747
00:54:03,202 --> 00:54:04,119
Should you listen...

748
00:54:04,203 --> 00:54:06,205
[I know a guy from]
San Pedro, all right?

749
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,582
Dude's name is Grill.
He's from 40ies Town, you know?

750
00:54:08,665 --> 00:54:10,459
- Grill, 40ies Town.
- Yes.

751
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:12,294
Grill, man.
The motherfucker, he knows all of them.

752
00:54:12,461 --> 00:54:13,670
All right, let me--Hey!

753
00:54:14,588 --> 00:54:15,339
Hey!

754
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:17,007
What about him?

755
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:18,717
- The fucker is not going to jail.
- Hey!

756
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,219
I wanna run Grill through [database],

757
00:54:20,344 --> 00:54:22,262
- see if I can get an address.
- Hey! Fucking white boys!

758
00:54:34,733 --> 00:54:35,818
Fuck.

759
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:41,740
Shit.

760
00:54:42,574 --> 00:54:44,409
Police!

761
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:47,079
Get on your face!

762
00:54:47,204 --> 00:54:49,248
What the fuck did I do, man?

763
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:53,460
Get your ass in here, Disco.

764
00:54:53,585 --> 00:54:55,420
No one's telling me
what the fuck I did.

765
00:54:55,504 --> 00:54:56,547
Shut up.

766
00:55:22,823 --> 00:55:23,866
Shit.

767
00:55:26,702 --> 00:55:28,704
You got two strikes, Grill.

768
00:55:29,121 --> 00:55:30,164
This is three strikes.

769
00:55:30,706 --> 00:55:32,040
25 (years) to life.

770
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:34,209
That ain't my fuckin' shit.
Fuck you!

771
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:36,336
You put that shit there.

772
00:55:36,461 --> 00:55:38,380
Dirty ass punk ass cop.

773
00:55:48,682 --> 00:55:50,058
What are you--?

774
00:55:50,309 --> 00:55:51,351
Shit!

775
00:55:51,476 --> 00:55:54,021
Ludlow!
- What the fuck, man?

776
00:55:57,274 --> 00:55:58,650
Stop!

777
00:55:58,859 --> 00:56:01,570
Fuck man.
Listen to your boy, man. Shit.

778
00:56:01,653 --> 00:56:03,197
Don't you have to ask
him something first?

779
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,491
Homey, right. Aren't you
supposed to ask me some shit first?

780
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:07,618
Fremont and Coates,
where're they at?

781
00:56:07,743 --> 00:56:09,578
Aww man,
stop hitting my fucking head first,

782
00:56:09,703 --> 00:56:11,288
and I'll tell you.

783
00:56:12,331 --> 00:56:14,166
Where do they fucking stay?

784
00:56:16,502 --> 00:56:19,421
You're fucking crazy, man.
I don't know where they're headed.

785
00:56:19,505 --> 00:56:21,798
???????????

786
00:56:22,508 --> 00:56:25,010
If I catch them, I'm gonna
bust their motherfucking head, man.

787
00:56:25,135 --> 00:56:28,055
Answer the fucking question!
How do we find them?

788
00:56:29,515 --> 00:56:31,934
Only cass ??(guy)I know
didn't know them.

789
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:33,811
It's up in the county (jail) man.
High Powell.

790
00:56:33,936 --> 00:56:36,188
- I'm gonna book you into county.
- For what, man?

791
00:56:37,648 --> 00:56:39,650
Talk to your friends.
Find me Fremont and Coates.

792
00:56:39,817 --> 00:56:40,943
and you'll be out by tomorrow,

793
00:56:41,068 --> 00:56:43,237
otherwise I'm gonna
book you for tomorrow.

794
00:56:43,362 --> 00:56:44,780
Fuck man, fuck!

795
00:56:50,744 --> 00:56:53,330
- I ain't no fucking snitch, man.
- I know that.

796
00:56:54,289 --> 00:56:56,041
There won't be no jacking,
no papers.

797
00:56:56,124 --> 00:56:57,751
It's just you and me.

798
00:56:57,835 --> 00:56:59,711
Fuck, man.

799
00:57:00,462 --> 00:57:03,090
Come on, they ain't nothing to you.
I want them.

800
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:06,510
All right, man.
Fuck it.

801
00:57:49,428 --> 00:57:51,221
Mrs. Washington?

802
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:56,643
Can we talk outside?

803
00:58:07,362 --> 00:58:09,823
Terrence had $ 50,000 in cash on him.

804
00:58:10,782 --> 00:58:14,203
This just might be more than just
wrong place, wrong time.

805
00:58:16,205 --> 00:58:17,998
"Might be"?

806
00:58:18,624 --> 00:58:21,835
How many people knew he was
talking to Internal Affairs?

807
00:58:23,754 --> 00:58:25,797
My husband had a good heart.

808
00:58:26,632 --> 00:58:30,093
And when he started listening to it,
he became a pariah.

809
00:58:31,011 --> 00:58:32,721
His eyes opened.

810
00:58:32,804 --> 00:58:34,848
When will your eyes open?

811
00:58:36,391 --> 00:58:39,353
Terrence always said
you were the worst one.

812
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:41,647
Because with all the shit
going on around you,

813
00:58:41,772 --> 00:58:44,024
you choose not to see.

814
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:46,652
Look, I came here to help you.
- Help me?

815
00:58:46,735 --> 00:58:49,112
You came to help
yourself sleep at night.

816
00:58:49,404 --> 00:58:51,615
That $ 50,000.
Do you think Terrence was stupid?

817
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:55,285
He knew he has a bull's eye in his back
the second he went to Captain Biggs.

818
00:58:56,245 --> 00:58:58,539
So we sold our house.

819
00:58:59,081 --> 00:59:01,834
We were leaving Friday for the Bahamas.

820
00:59:02,876 --> 00:59:04,795
To start over.

821
00:59:05,754 --> 00:59:07,923
Silly of us, wasn't it?

822
00:59:10,551 --> 00:59:12,719
Anything else, detective?

823
00:59:14,847 --> 00:59:15,973
No.

824
00:59:25,274 --> 00:59:26,859
Lud.

825
00:59:27,276 --> 00:59:29,153
What the fuck?

826
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:34,074
- How's complaints?
- You've just missed your wife.

827
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:35,576
- She was here?
- Yeah.

828
00:59:35,701 --> 00:59:37,244
That's cute.

829
00:59:38,287 --> 00:59:40,080
I got something for you.

830
00:59:47,546 --> 00:59:49,214
That's for you.

831
00:59:50,132 --> 00:59:53,844
- Is that it?
- That's it, yeah. That's it.

832
00:59:54,469 --> 00:59:58,515
You can keep it as a nice souvenir
for yourself ???.

833
00:59:58,932 --> 01:00:00,809
I mean, it is over.

834
01:00:04,229 --> 01:00:06,982
Tom, this is over.

835
01:00:08,734 --> 01:00:11,028
We got your back, Tom.

836
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:26,543
[PROJECTILE]
[WASHINGTON, TERRENCE]

837
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:40,807
- Yeah.
- It's your man at High Powell.

838
01:00:41,016 --> 01:00:43,018
- I got the name.
- Fire away.

839
01:00:43,101 --> 01:00:46,688
It is an old Cheetoh (crook).
He sells a little this, a little that.

840
01:00:46,772 --> 01:00:48,398
He drives an old S Cadillac.

841
01:00:48,482 --> 01:00:51,693
- Name.
- Scribble. They call him Scribble.

842
01:00:52,236 --> 01:00:54,905
His real name's Winston or some shit.
I don't know.

843
01:00:55,239 --> 01:00:56,615
All right, [now get me out of here.]

844
01:00:57,032 --> 01:00:58,784
It's on its way.

845
01:00:59,201 --> 01:01:02,955
I can't believe this shit worked.
Scribble. It's catchy.

846
01:01:03,288 --> 01:01:05,624
We got a metro unit tailing him.

847
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:08,252
Go get him, Disco.

848
01:01:08,377 --> 01:01:11,296
- Make me proud.
- You're not coming?

849
01:01:19,221 --> 01:01:22,432
- Watch it, watch it!
- Are you married, Diskant?

850
01:01:23,475 --> 01:01:26,270
Engaged. And I'd like
to see her again.

851
01:01:26,979 --> 01:01:29,064
Have you ever heard of something
like the cookie jar

852
01:01:29,189 --> 01:01:32,067
in reference to corruption.
Shakedown, Serpico shit?

853
01:01:32,568 --> 01:01:35,571
- No, why?
- A complaint I'm working on.

854
01:01:35,863 --> 01:01:38,782
We are eastbound, Vernon passing.
[Should we stop him?]

855
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,993
That's a negative,
just keep eyes on him.

856
01:01:41,118 --> 01:01:42,411
I call it out. We're en route.

857
01:01:42,536 --> 01:01:44,621
Watch it!
Crosswalk.

858
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:49,418
There he is.

859
01:01:49,543 --> 01:01:52,671
- We got him. Break out.
- That's a roger.

860
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,093
Shit.

861
01:02:09,271 --> 01:02:11,190
Hands where I can see them!

862
01:02:15,444 --> 01:02:18,197
Who are you supposed to be, man?
Narcs?

863
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:20,741
Yes, we're Narcs (Narcotics).

864
01:02:20,866 --> 01:02:24,286
Look how pinned out your eyes are.
Take a little off the top?

865
01:02:24,411 --> 01:02:26,163
A little Jones maintenance?

866
01:02:26,288 --> 01:02:27,664
You need to kick that shit.

867
01:02:27,748 --> 01:02:29,958
I got a lawyer, you might wanna
talk to him. I got his card.

868
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:32,294
You wake up.
Nothing's happened yet.

869
01:02:32,377 --> 01:02:35,589
But FYI (for your information),
I know you've got a no-bail-warrant.

870
01:02:35,881 --> 01:02:38,509
I put the cuffs on now,
you're locked up until the Apocalypse.

871
01:02:38,592 --> 01:02:40,636
Whatever, man.
Take me on a ride right now, dawg.

872
01:02:40,761 --> 01:02:41,887
I mean, read me my Miranda (rights).

873
01:02:42,012 --> 01:02:43,972
Put your hands back
on the fucking wheel!

874
01:02:44,097 --> 01:02:46,517
Yo, "242".
Watch those fucking jokers.

875
01:02:46,725 --> 01:02:48,894
Get back!
Get the fuck back!

876
01:02:49,603 --> 01:02:52,815
- Fuck you're looking at, white boy?
- Get the fuck back!

877
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:55,108
Do you really wanna
kick heroin in County?

878
01:02:55,192 --> 01:02:58,070
Wanna see that judge all sick,
shitting and puking yourself?

879
01:02:58,403 --> 01:03:00,823
That'll look real good.
And for what?

880
01:03:00,948 --> 01:03:02,950
You are just a rung in
a ladder I'm climbing.

881
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:04,409
What ladder, man?

882
01:03:05,244 --> 01:03:08,205
How do I find Fremont and Coates?

883
01:03:10,123 --> 01:03:13,961
Look, I ain't got no love
for them banana boat motherfuckers, man.

884
01:03:14,044 --> 01:03:15,337
But those dudes are straight masters,

885
01:03:15,796 --> 01:03:18,173
they'd put me in a box
if they think I'm snitching.

886
01:03:18,257 --> 01:03:19,591
I am not asking to finger
(fuck) the guys...

887
01:03:19,675 --> 01:03:20,133
on an open court,

888
01:03:20,259 --> 01:03:21,844
I just wanna find them.

889
01:03:21,969 --> 01:03:23,929
Once I do,
you're out of the net.

890
01:03:25,264 --> 01:03:26,974
I ain't seen them in a week, man.

891
01:03:27,057 --> 01:03:29,643
- Got a number?
- No, I ain't got no number.

892
01:03:30,602 --> 01:03:33,355
Look, all they do is drop
phones all the time.

893
01:03:33,438 --> 01:03:34,481
They call me, man.

894
01:03:34,606 --> 01:03:36,692
Look man, your man makes me nervous,
could you--

895
01:03:36,775 --> 01:03:38,485
Look at me.
Look at me!

896
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:41,655
You wanna see that judge?
You're gonna help me find 'em.

897
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:48,162
Look. I did business with
them one time in El Sereno.

898
01:03:48,996 --> 01:03:51,748
In their badass house,
way up in the hills.

899
01:03:51,874 --> 01:03:52,916
That's it.

900
01:03:56,128 --> 01:03:57,379
Show me.

901
01:03:57,588 --> 01:04:00,507
You expect me to leave
my car in the hood, man?

902
01:04:47,554 --> 01:04:49,264
Someone had a party.

903
01:05:13,914 --> 01:05:15,666
Smell that?

904
01:05:44,945 --> 01:05:46,864
Want me to put it out?

905
01:05:49,158 --> 01:05:51,451
No, get the murder book.

906
01:05:58,041 --> 01:05:59,793
Yes, it's Fremont.

907
01:06:04,548 --> 01:06:07,176
And this is his buddy, Coates.

908
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:13,265
- We found them.
- Great. Case closed.

909
01:06:14,308 --> 01:06:17,227
Now these guys have been here a while,
there's no way they killed Washington.

910
01:06:17,644 --> 01:06:19,438
You think?

911
01:06:20,063 --> 01:06:23,066
Fuck you.
I'm doing my best.

912
01:06:23,484 --> 01:06:26,195
If Fremont and Coates
didn't kill Washington, who did?

913
01:06:26,528 --> 01:06:28,989
- Who are we chasing?
- The assholes who smoked these guys.

914
01:06:29,072 --> 01:06:31,867
harvested their DNA and
planted it in the market, that's who.

915
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:35,704
I'm with you.
But why do you frame two dead dudes?

916
01:06:36,538 --> 01:06:38,832
We're gonna ask them.

917
01:06:40,167 --> 01:06:42,127
Let's go.

918
01:06:49,134 --> 01:06:50,177
What's up, man?

919
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:52,346
You know it's coyotes
out here and shit, right?

920
01:06:52,763 --> 01:06:54,264
Yo, they've been gone a minute.

921
01:06:54,389 --> 01:06:56,642
Do you know these guys?

922
01:06:57,768 --> 01:07:00,312
No man, I ain't never seen these dudes.

923
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,982
Look, if Fremont and Coates call you,
set up a meeting.

924
01:07:04,483 --> 01:07:07,277
You tell them I can do for them
what Washington can't anymore.

925
01:07:07,361 --> 01:07:09,321
They'll know what you mean.

926
01:07:13,492 --> 01:07:17,871
All right man, I hook it up.
Now you take me back to my car?

927
01:07:18,705 --> 01:07:20,249
Sure.

928
01:07:42,604 --> 01:07:46,024
- This way.
- Yeah, thank you.

929
01:07:47,609 --> 01:07:50,863
I hope you guys will play nice
with the new girl.

930
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,950
- Is Tom taking care of you?
- I take care of him.

931
01:07:55,367 --> 01:07:57,494
How's complaints, Lud?

932
01:07:59,246 --> 01:08:01,832
Another scrape on a body
and it's a traffic collision.

933
01:08:02,249 --> 01:08:04,334
So, Tom here falls apart
when he's not chasing bad guys.

934
01:08:04,459 --> 01:08:05,586
He's always been like that.

935
01:08:05,669 --> 01:08:07,713
He was born without fear.
I could tell you some stories.

936
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:08,255
Tell me.

937
01:08:08,338 --> 01:08:10,132
No, we don't get so intolerant here.???

938
01:08:10,215 --> 01:08:12,050
I got the classic Tom Ludlow story.

939
01:08:12,885 --> 01:08:15,470
When he was a rookie,
I took him under my wing.

940
01:08:15,554 --> 01:08:18,348
It was a Friday night,
and we were in Crib city,

941
01:08:18,474 --> 01:08:19,516
that's a [bad area]

942
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:21,727
lots of dope and shootings,
whatever, what have you.

943
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:24,771
So, we get to this quarrel
that shut down this house party.

944
01:08:25,314 --> 01:08:27,524
And Tom, he's like the
saltiest boot ever,

945
01:08:27,608 --> 01:08:28,650
and I think:

946
01:08:28,775 --> 01:08:30,819
Let's give him a lesson
in humility.

947
01:08:30,903 --> 01:08:33,989
So I sent him in there.
Alone.

948
01:08:34,531 --> 01:08:36,742
And all of a sudden,
all hell breaks loose, right?

949
01:08:37,159 --> 01:08:40,204
They got guys coming out of the doors,
others flew out of the windows...

950
01:08:40,746 --> 01:08:43,290
Everybody is screaming inside,
I rush in, I charge in,

951
01:08:43,415 --> 01:08:44,666
and there's Tom,
busting heads.

952
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:46,543
They wouldn't turn the music down.

953
01:08:48,504 --> 01:08:51,548
Tom's always gonna be Tom.
He's like a guided missile, locks on...

954
01:08:51,673 --> 01:08:53,258
That's it.

955
01:09:13,278 --> 01:09:15,823
- Yeah?
- Hey, so I just talked to Scribble.

956
01:09:16,532 --> 01:09:19,910
Fremont and Coates, or whoever they are,
want to meet us.

957
01:09:21,161 --> 01:09:23,580
- When?
- Tonight.

958
01:09:25,082 --> 01:09:27,000
I see you at Vice in an hour.

959
01:09:38,428 --> 01:09:40,514
I know it's late,
I'm sorry.

960
01:09:41,807 --> 01:09:45,018
- I wanted you to have this.
- And that is?

961
01:09:46,353 --> 01:09:48,522
It's the video
of your husband's murder.

962
01:09:49,356 --> 01:09:51,275
It shows everything.

963
01:09:51,692 --> 01:09:53,610
Why are you doing this?

964
01:09:54,444 --> 01:09:56,905
Because I know how not knowing hurts.

965
01:09:58,574 --> 01:10:01,493
When I lost my wife,
she was with another man.

966
01:10:03,787 --> 01:10:06,623
She had a blood clot in her brain,
and then it burst.

967
01:10:09,668 --> 01:10:12,004
The bastard dumped her outside
of the hospital and...

968
01:10:14,089 --> 01:10:16,300
she died quite alone on the sidewalk.

969
01:10:20,262 --> 01:10:21,680
Linda...

970
01:10:21,805 --> 01:10:24,600
I am sorry for wanting to hurt Terrence.

971
01:10:24,725 --> 01:10:26,727
and I'm sorry for your loss.

972
01:10:28,395 --> 01:10:30,689
I want you to know
he didn't die alone.

973
01:10:31,523 --> 01:10:34,193
and that the men who killed him
are gonna pay.

974
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:47,539
That won't bring him back.

975
01:10:49,416 --> 01:10:51,668
And that won't bring your wife back.

976
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,630
I don't care.

977
01:10:57,341 --> 01:11:00,469
Not in my name.
Please.

978
01:11:01,512 --> 01:11:03,472
Not in my name.

979
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:07,226
That doesn't wash away blood.

980
01:11:09,102 --> 01:11:11,063
Shouldn't we roll with backup?

981
01:11:11,188 --> 01:11:13,941
- Fuck backup.
- What? Why?

982
01:11:16,151 --> 01:11:17,903
What do you think
is going to happen tonight?

983
01:11:18,028 --> 01:11:19,988
Do you think I'm
throwing the cuffs on these boys,

984
01:11:20,113 --> 01:11:23,367
drive them back to the barn
and write it up?

985
01:11:25,661 --> 01:11:27,287
Here's the deal:

986
01:11:27,371 --> 01:11:30,207
I'm going out there
and you go now,

987
01:11:30,833 --> 01:11:33,836
and we never ever gonna
discuss any of this again.

988
01:11:33,919 --> 01:11:35,212
What? What do you mean?

989
01:11:35,295 --> 01:11:38,423
It means Fremont and Coates
never existed and we never met.

990
01:11:43,345 --> 01:11:45,264
I'm not going home tonight, Tom.

991
01:11:45,681 --> 01:11:47,224
Look, Paul...

992
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:50,727
This thing you want,
that you think you want,

993
01:11:51,145 --> 01:11:52,521
you don't want.

994
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:55,357
You don't know
who I am or what I want.

995
01:11:56,191 --> 01:11:58,110
Who are you to judge me?

996
01:12:00,195 --> 01:12:02,281
You want to be a gunfighter, huh?

997
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:17,963
Then let's do it.

998
01:12:29,808 --> 01:12:31,602
Back on the night watch, Tom?

999
01:12:33,562 --> 01:12:36,732
You two keep
being seen all over town.

1000
01:12:39,026 --> 01:12:42,613
Tom, did you really think
I was gonna do nothing about you?

1001
01:12:43,447 --> 01:12:46,492
If you're gonna do something,
do it now.

1002
01:12:49,703 --> 01:12:52,664
I know you want my scalp
nailed to your wall,

1003
01:12:52,789 --> 01:12:54,166
but then who's gonna
go in when the law won't?

1004
01:12:54,875 --> 01:12:56,543
You, Captain?

1005
01:12:57,461 --> 01:12:58,754
You?

1006
01:12:59,254 --> 01:13:01,381
You gonna clean up the needles
and baby parts?

1007
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:05,594
No. You need me
and our company of men.

1008
01:13:05,677 --> 01:13:08,514
You hate me
but you need me.

1009
01:13:11,517 --> 01:13:13,060
Ludlow...

1010
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:16,772
Maybe you're right.
Maybe we do need you,

1011
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:20,609
but goddamn if you don't need me, son.

1012
01:13:26,865 --> 01:13:28,450
Hey, detective.

1013
01:13:29,993 --> 01:13:31,453
You've ever asked yourself

1014
01:13:31,537 --> 01:13:34,164
if Washington's dead
because he was dirty

1015
01:13:34,498 --> 01:13:36,416
or because he came clean?

1016
01:13:48,679 --> 01:13:50,973
Swap your rounds out.

1017
01:13:51,807 --> 01:13:53,350
We don't want the coroner digging...

1018
01:13:53,433 --> 01:13:55,352
department issue ammo
out of these assholes.

1019
01:13:58,147 --> 01:13:59,815
Use the gloves.

1020
01:14:01,692 --> 01:14:05,028
Jesus,
these are some serious man slappers.

1021
01:14:06,864 --> 01:14:09,241
So we just go in there and kill them?

1022
01:14:11,451 --> 01:14:14,037
No, I 'm gonna ask
them some questions.

1023
01:14:14,872 --> 01:14:17,166
Then we're gonna kill them.

1024
01:15:01,418 --> 01:15:03,003
Fucking time, man.

1025
01:15:04,171 --> 01:15:05,797
No gun?

1026
01:15:06,924 --> 01:15:08,884
You know that's some bullshit, right?

1027
01:15:08,967 --> 01:15:10,928
These dudes is monsters, right?

1028
01:15:11,011 --> 01:15:15,265
I mean, if they can't fuck it, rob it
or kill it, they don't want it.

1029
01:15:17,935 --> 01:15:20,562
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1030
01:15:21,522 --> 01:15:27,069
- Make the introduction.
- All right. Tried take.???

1031
01:15:52,594 --> 01:15:55,347
Get fucking in here.
- Shit, man.

1032
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:57,391
You, move to the fucking wall.

1033
01:15:57,641 --> 01:15:59,935
What the hell is this?
You know we're cops.

1034
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:01,395
Get over there.

1035
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:04,481
- They're cool, man.
- Shut the fuck up, Scribble.

1036
01:16:05,899 --> 01:16:07,067
Get in here.

1037
01:16:07,192 --> 01:16:09,361
Yo, do you think I'm fucking playing?

1038
01:16:09,778 --> 01:16:12,865
Get your asses against the wall
before you find your brains up here.

1039
01:16:13,031 --> 01:16:14,241
We're here to do business.

1040
01:16:14,324 --> 01:16:16,493
If you want me feel me up,
come on and try it.

1041
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:19,454
Oh, shit. You want a fill of shit?

1042
01:16:19,788 --> 01:16:21,582
Cause he ain't taking it out for you.

1043
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:26,545
Shut the fuck up, Richard.
Scribble say they good.

1044
01:16:27,379 --> 01:16:29,548
- Scribble, what's up
with these fools, man?

1045
01:16:29,673 --> 01:16:30,924
They good, man. They cool.

1046
01:16:31,049 --> 01:16:34,386
- Nigger, take a seat.
- Fucking asshole!

1047
01:16:35,929 --> 01:16:39,141
- You wanna drink?
- No, we're good.

1048
01:16:42,603 --> 01:16:45,355
Man, we got the one time
opportunity.

1049
01:16:47,149 --> 01:16:51,320
Motherfucking PoPo.
Is there any square cops out there?

1050
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:54,490
Or is everybody out for theirs?

1051
01:16:55,115 --> 01:16:57,159
Everyone's out for theirs.

1052
01:16:57,284 --> 01:16:59,661
- Way of the world.
- Duh.

1053
01:16:59,995 --> 01:17:01,747
Cops are like weeds...

1054
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:05,125
You pull one out,
and two more fucking grow back.

1055
01:17:05,918 --> 01:17:08,212
Well, Washington got greedy.

1056
01:17:11,465 --> 01:17:15,427
Don't shoot me now, I'm just
gonna get something out of my pocket.

1057
01:17:19,556 --> 01:17:21,517
This is just a sample.

1058
01:17:22,684 --> 01:17:24,478
We're all about weight.

1059
01:17:24,603 --> 01:17:27,397
We can help you transport.
letting you know if there's heat.

1060
01:17:27,606 --> 01:17:30,025
letting you know if you're selling
to a narc or a snitch,

1061
01:17:30,234 --> 01:17:32,820
or bust people
and sell you their shit.

1062
01:17:44,456 --> 01:17:46,583
We're all about weight, too.

1063
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:51,255
Look at that shit.
That's sexy right there.

1064
01:17:52,089 --> 01:17:54,174
That's better than pussy.

1065
01:17:54,716 --> 01:17:59,012
That's better than money.
Ain't no Mexican tar neither.

1066
01:17:59,221 --> 01:18:02,808
That's their worldwide war
on terror dope, nigger.

1067
01:18:02,933 --> 01:18:05,894
Pure Afghan home.

1068
01:18:06,645 --> 01:18:08,981
Lord, we know this chap.

1069
01:18:09,314 --> 01:18:12,151
That's the same motherfucker
that was in the market...

1070
01:18:12,276 --> 01:18:14,194
the day we pushed Washington??? back.

1071
01:18:14,987 --> 01:18:16,738
Hell, yeah.

1072
01:18:17,531 --> 01:18:19,408
That was you, right?

1073
01:18:20,117 --> 01:18:21,702
Come on, man, cool, man.

1074
01:18:21,827 --> 01:18:25,164
Y'all just chill out.
I see where this is going, all right?

1075
01:18:25,247 --> 01:18:26,248
Everybody just be cool, man.

1076
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:27,791
We got all these
thrilling opportunities.

1077
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:31,879
- I'm gonna pump me some of this shit--
- Shut your fat ass up.

1078
01:18:35,382 --> 01:18:37,593
Is that what you're here for, dawg?

1079
01:18:38,093 --> 01:18:39,928
You here to get some get-back...

1080
01:18:40,012 --> 01:18:42,556
for that sorry ass
nigger, Detective Ludlow?

1081
01:18:45,058 --> 01:18:47,102
No, you guys did me a favor.

1082
01:18:48,854 --> 01:18:52,733
So you know who I am
and I know who you're not.

1083
01:18:53,442 --> 01:18:57,529
If you're not Fremont and Coates,
then who the hell are you?

1084
01:18:59,448 --> 01:19:02,326
Who are we, detective?

1085
01:19:04,661 --> 01:19:07,122
We're straight nightmares.

1086
01:19:07,414 --> 01:19:12,211
We're the walking, talking
"exigent circumstances".

1087
01:19:13,128 --> 01:19:15,964
Ludlow, wait!
I know these guys!

1088
01:19:35,067 --> 01:19:37,319
It's all over, detective.

1089
01:19:38,153 --> 01:19:39,613
Shit!

1090
01:19:39,696 --> 01:19:41,657
I will do your bitch ass
like my nigger did our partner.

1091
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:43,158
Hold on, Diskant, hold on.

1092
01:19:43,242 --> 01:19:44,910
What the fuck are you doing?

1093
01:19:44,993 --> 01:19:47,371
Nigger, pick that gun up and
blast the motherfucker!

1094
01:19:47,663 --> 01:19:49,498
[I'm scared, ] dawg.

1095
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:53,126
The next one in your
dome (head), nigger.

1096
01:19:55,587 --> 01:19:58,006
- Winston, don't do it!
- "Winston"?

1097
01:19:58,090 --> 01:20:01,093
Winston? What the fuck is that?
That's your slave name, nigger.

1098
01:20:01,635 --> 01:20:04,138
Do it, nigger.
Man, kill them white boy!

1099
01:20:04,346 --> 01:20:07,474
Yo, white man killed a white boy.(???)

1100
01:20:07,766 --> 01:20:10,644
- I can't, man.
- Fuck this nigger!

1101
01:20:13,647 --> 01:20:15,941
Comin' out, dawg, cover me.
Come on.

1102
01:20:21,572 --> 01:20:23,282
Hang on.

1103
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:24,783
Hang on.

1104
01:22:32,911 --> 01:22:35,789
- Let me see.
- Why are you crying?

1105
01:22:36,748 --> 01:22:38,750
Take that off.

1106
01:22:42,963 --> 01:22:44,756
Sit down, Tom.

1107
01:22:47,301 --> 01:22:48,969
It went bad, Grace.

1108
01:22:49,595 --> 01:22:51,138
I know...

1109
01:22:51,388 --> 01:22:52,806
I know.

1110
01:22:57,603 --> 01:22:59,521
I should have gone alone.

1111
01:22:59,813 --> 01:23:01,899
I took a boy to a gunfight.

1112
01:23:04,610 --> 01:23:06,778
Why are you crying?

1113
01:23:07,112 --> 01:23:09,072
What's wrong?

1114
01:23:09,156 --> 01:23:11,241
What's wrong?

1115
01:23:14,286 --> 01:23:16,371
<i>...in our coverage of tonight's story</i>

1116
01:23:16,455 --> 01:23:20,584
<i>Detective Tom Ludlow, an 18 year veteran
of the Los Angeles police department,</i>

1117
01:23:20,709 --> 01:23:22,336
<i>is wanted in connection
with the shooting deaths</i>

1118
01:23:22,503 --> 01:23:26,548
<i>of two undercover deputy sheriffs
in the early hours of the morning.</i>

1119
01:23:26,673 --> 01:23:28,383
<i>Officials have yet to confirm...</i>

1120
01:23:28,509 --> 01:23:31,136
<i>a third victim who may
also be a police officer.</i>

1121
01:23:31,261 --> 01:23:33,347
<i>In addition, they have
stated Detective Ludlow...</i>

1122
01:23:33,472 --> 01:23:35,224
<i>was off duty at the
time of the shootings</i>

1123
01:23:35,349 --> 01:23:37,267
<i>- and is the only suspect in yet another
- Cunts.</i>

1124
01:23:37,392 --> 01:23:39,269
tragedy of the L.A. law enforcement.

1125
01:23:39,978 --> 01:23:41,271
<i>Of course we will
continue to bring you...</i>

1126
01:23:41,396 --> 01:23:44,149
How do they know that?
That they were cops?

1127
01:23:44,858 --> 01:23:47,569
I just left.
It's on the news?

1128
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,197
Did you do it?

1129
01:23:52,533 --> 01:23:54,159
Of course you did it.

1130
01:23:54,243 --> 01:23:56,245
I had no idea
they were deputies,

1131
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:57,788
but I should have.

1132
01:23:57,871 --> 01:24:00,624
"Exigent circumstances".
Jesus!

1133
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:04,545
What is wrong with you?
Huh?

1134
01:24:04,878 --> 01:24:08,590
Why can't you have
a normal life like everyone else?

1135
01:24:09,007 --> 01:24:10,759
- I should go.
- No.

1136
01:24:10,884 --> 01:24:14,721
- No, you're not going out there.
- This is gonna be a nightmare, Grace.

1137
01:24:14,805 --> 01:24:16,598
- I gotta go.
- No, Tom.

1138
01:24:16,682 --> 01:24:18,600
The door is staying closed.

1139
01:24:19,226 --> 01:24:22,396
Every cop in L.A. is hunting for you,
you wanna get killed?

1140
01:24:24,731 --> 01:24:27,317
You need to get away from me, okay?

1141
01:24:27,442 --> 01:24:29,736
You need to get far away.

1142
01:24:31,488 --> 01:24:33,740
Everything I touch dies.

1143
01:24:35,325 --> 01:24:36,952
Down on the fucking floor!

1144
01:24:37,578 --> 01:24:41,165
- ???????
- Now!

1145
01:24:41,456 --> 01:24:43,458
- Don't say a fucking word.
- No, please.

1146
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:45,419
Shut up.

1147
01:24:47,087 --> 01:24:48,672
Get up.

1148
01:24:52,176 --> 01:24:54,970
You're an asshole. You're going down.
You killed two fucking cops.

1149
01:24:55,053 --> 01:24:56,847
What's the matter with you?

1150
01:24:58,098 --> 01:25:00,058
Get that piece of shit out of here.

1151
01:25:14,114 --> 01:25:15,949
- Downtown is the other way.
- We're not going downtown.

1152
01:25:16,033 --> 01:25:17,826
Where are you going?

1153
01:25:19,912 --> 01:25:22,122
That bitch of yours is fine.

1154
01:25:22,206 --> 01:25:24,958
- What?
- Saw you with Washington's widow.

1155
01:25:25,375 --> 01:25:27,586
You're fucking them both, huh?

1156
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:31,548
- Which one are you feeling, Dante?
- I like Linda.

1157
01:25:31,632 --> 01:25:34,301
You shouldn't have given
her the video, Lud.

1158
01:25:34,384 --> 01:25:36,512
What the fuck were you thinking?

1159
01:25:36,595 --> 01:25:38,680
- You handed that bitch
your death sentence.

1160
01:25:38,806 --> 01:25:40,265
The hell are you talking about?

1161
01:25:40,474 --> 01:25:42,184
We've been watching you, asshole.

1162
01:25:42,309 --> 01:25:44,686
How many times were
you told to let it go?

1163
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:47,147
- How many?
- Let's go home.

1164
01:25:47,231 --> 01:25:49,107
Fuck him.
Look what he's making us do.

1165
01:25:49,233 --> 01:25:51,109
Smug fucking punk.

1166
01:25:51,235 --> 01:25:52,694
Did you figure it out, Lud?

1167
01:25:53,111 --> 01:25:55,364
How do Fremont and Coates
make it to the market that day?

1168
01:25:55,489 --> 01:25:58,826
After Washington got them kicked
loose, you picked 'em back up.

1169
01:25:59,243 --> 01:26:01,161
You took them to the hills
and popped their melons, right?

1170
01:26:01,245 --> 01:26:02,871
You should be a detective.

1171
01:26:02,955 --> 01:26:06,291
- We took some DNA samples first.
- Little bit of hair, a little spit.

1172
01:26:06,375 --> 01:26:08,210
Voil.
Fremont and Coates did it.

1173
01:26:08,293 --> 01:26:11,755
Who signed out the dope
wasn't Washington. You.

1174
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,590
That was gonna be
incinerated. Might as well...

1175
01:26:13,674 --> 01:26:15,342
sell it and make a dollar
out of it, you know?

1176
01:26:15,425 --> 01:26:17,386
For you or the cookie jar?

1177
01:26:22,391 --> 01:26:25,686
You're not that smart, Santos.
Who is in?

1178
01:26:25,853 --> 01:26:28,313
Silky?
Clady?

1179
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:36,530
Wander.

1180
01:26:38,615 --> 01:26:40,325
Wander.

1181
01:26:45,038 --> 01:26:47,249
It's a Wander caper all the way.

1182
01:26:48,458 --> 01:26:50,711
He's the only one who
could pull those strings.

1183
01:26:50,794 --> 01:26:52,963
He should have pulled
your string years ago.

1184
01:26:53,088 --> 01:26:55,382
We couldn't figure out why the fuck
he kept you around all this time.

1185
01:26:55,591 --> 01:26:59,595
He's Jack's little pet. He's been doing
the man's dirty missions for years.

1186
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:02,181
Washington wasn't giving me up to Biggs.

1187
01:27:04,725 --> 01:27:08,687
He was giving up the big dog.
He was giving up the king.

1188
01:27:09,021 --> 01:27:11,940
Wander played your fool ass, puto.
We all have.

1189
01:27:12,941 --> 01:27:14,526
You're a fucking chum, bro.

1190
01:27:21,450 --> 01:27:24,077
Washington's killers,
were they really cops?

1191
01:27:24,203 --> 01:27:26,497
Yeah, they were. Couple
deputies from the ghetto,

1192
01:27:26,622 --> 01:27:28,040
having the time of their lives.

1193
01:27:28,165 --> 01:27:29,416
And they were making a lot of money.

1194
01:27:29,541 --> 01:27:30,876
Those were gonna punch
your ticket (kill you),

1195
01:27:30,959 --> 01:27:31,710
but you punched theirs.

1196
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:33,587
Yeah, now we gotta punch yours.

1197
01:27:34,087 --> 01:27:35,589
Up in the hills.

1198
01:27:35,714 --> 01:27:37,174
Up in the hills, brother.

1199
01:27:37,299 --> 01:27:39,259
First we bite your hair,
saliva and blood.

1200
01:27:39,384 --> 01:27:41,678
When they finally know
Washington's corps,

1201
01:27:41,762 --> 01:27:43,764
guess whose DNA gonna be all over it?

1202
01:27:43,847 --> 01:27:45,349
And what is it gonna look like?

1203
01:27:46,225 --> 01:27:49,269
Like you finally snapped
just like everyone knew you would.

1204
01:27:49,686 --> 01:27:51,563
That little nurse of yours, Lud?

1205
01:27:51,688 --> 01:27:53,690
You know, I'm popping a 100 mill Viagra

1206
01:27:53,816 --> 01:27:56,443
and I'm gonna work
that little brown ass.

1207
01:27:57,069 --> 01:27:59,071
And then I'm gonna break her neck.

1208
01:28:06,078 --> 01:28:08,705
Get the fucking cuffs off me!

1209
01:28:14,503 --> 01:28:16,922
Get off, you motherfucker!

1210
01:28:17,714 --> 01:28:19,925
Motherfucker!

1211
01:28:27,850 --> 01:28:29,768
Motherfucker!

1212
01:28:42,197 --> 01:28:45,784
Well hello there, handsome.
Did you have a nice nap?

1213
01:29:11,768 --> 01:29:14,229
Santos, your girlfriend's getting away.

1214
01:29:19,151 --> 01:29:22,321
What are you doing, Lud?
Are you crawling to your own grave?

1215
01:29:22,988 --> 01:29:25,449
Watch me play with this fool.
Hey pendecho.

1216
01:29:41,965 --> 01:29:43,801
Oh, yeah.

1217
01:29:47,888 --> 01:29:50,182
Who is the boy now, motherfucker? Huh?

1218
01:29:50,974 --> 01:29:52,935
Homeboy wants to bury himself.

1219
01:29:53,018 --> 01:29:55,187
Just do the fucking [job]
and let's go.

1220
01:30:06,949 --> 01:30:08,492
This is it, Lud.

1221
01:30:10,953 --> 01:30:14,164
- This is how it ends.
- DeMille, what the fuck? Let's go, bro!

1222
01:30:14,289 --> 01:30:16,291
Shut up, I'm having fun!

1223
01:31:06,091 --> 01:31:08,719
Where is the fucking disk?

1224
01:31:12,764 --> 01:31:14,308
Where is the disk?

1225
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:41,376
Come here.

1226
01:31:41,502 --> 01:31:42,711
You're a lot tougher than...

1227
01:31:42,794 --> 01:31:44,755
that piece of shit
husband you used to have.

1228
01:31:46,548 --> 01:31:48,258
????? is off.

1229
01:31:50,886 --> 01:31:53,096
We 're gonna be here all night.

1230
01:32:06,151 --> 01:32:09,696
You gotta go, Linda.
wherever it is, you gotta go.

1231
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:12,115
I have everything packed.

1232
01:32:13,116 --> 01:32:15,118
Take care of yourself, detective.

1233
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,585
Where do you wanna go, cop killer?

1234
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:43,897
I let myself in.

1235
01:32:45,941 --> 01:32:47,693
Clearly.

1236
01:32:48,735 --> 01:32:51,363
You all right, Tom?
I've been worried about you.

1237
01:32:52,364 --> 01:32:55,784
Apparently I killed two deputies.
Diskant is dead.

1238
01:32:55,909 --> 01:32:58,537
Santos and DeMille
dragged me out to die,

1239
01:32:58,662 --> 01:32:59,830
so I put them down.

1240
01:33:01,206 --> 01:33:02,416
- Can you fix this, Jack?

1241
01:33:02,499 --> 01:33:04,418
Oh, I'm gonna fix it. I'm gonna fix it.

1242
01:33:04,626 --> 01:33:06,336
You know, I suspected that
Santos and DeMille...

1243
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:07,921
were capering with
Washington, but...

1244
01:33:09,339 --> 01:33:11,425
I don't want to believe that this
kind of shit was going on in my unit.

1245
01:33:11,550 --> 01:33:12,968
Yeah, me neither.

1246
01:33:13,343 --> 01:33:16,346
Boss, you better get Clady up here.
I need you guys.

1247
01:33:16,472 --> 01:33:17,931
I'll get him in the loop.

1248
01:33:18,432 --> 01:33:21,643
Better plan what we're doing.
You need an alibi.

1249
01:33:21,977 --> 01:33:26,690
You were sleeping on a
couch after the party.

1250
01:33:27,232 --> 01:33:30,694
Santos and DeMille, they killed
those deppies, not you. Not you.

1251
01:33:40,329 --> 01:33:42,915
[He's here. Kill him. King's X. ]

1252
01:33:45,417 --> 01:33:49,338
This is Clady's phone,
and his badge.

1253
01:33:50,714 --> 01:33:53,217
All this is you.
It's you, Jack.

1254
01:33:53,509 --> 01:33:55,469
No, it's you.
It's you, Tom.

1255
01:33:55,552 --> 01:33:58,013
Honor it!
Fucking honor it!

1256
01:33:58,555 --> 01:33:59,681
You knew they were cops.

1257
01:33:59,807 --> 01:34:01,725
Those guys are so deep
undercover that they--

1258
01:34:01,850 --> 01:34:03,101
They lost their fucking minds!

1259
01:34:03,435 --> 01:34:04,978
Don't mourn them. You can't mourn them.

1260
01:34:05,103 --> 01:34:07,898
You set me up.
You sent me into dying, Jack!

1261
01:34:07,981 --> 01:34:09,316
I didn't set you up!

1262
01:34:09,441 --> 01:34:12,653
You set yourself up!
I was trying to save you.

1263
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:14,446
You're backing up in a fucking corner--

1264
01:34:14,571 --> 01:34:17,115
- You killed Washington!
- Fuck him!

1265
01:34:17,241 --> 01:34:21,119
Fuck Santos. Fuck DeMille. Fuck Clady.
Fuck 'em all.

1266
01:34:21,328 --> 01:34:22,996
Fuck them all!

1267
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:24,957
They are a dime a dozen (worthless).

1268
01:34:25,082 --> 01:34:26,542
You.

1269
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:30,963
You man.
You're special.

1270
01:34:31,255 --> 01:34:34,174
- You're special to me.
- Diskant.

1271
01:34:34,633 --> 01:34:36,635
He is special.

1272
01:34:36,969 --> 01:34:39,429
I've watched a good man die
because of you.

1273
01:34:39,638 --> 01:34:43,350
That is entirely your fault.

1274
01:34:44,768 --> 01:34:46,311
Come on, Tom.

1275
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,564
I know we can get past this.

1276
01:34:51,525 --> 01:34:54,444
We got a destiny,
you and me.

1277
01:34:56,446 --> 01:34:58,240
Nobody's getting past this, Jack.

1278
01:34:59,241 --> 01:35:03,036
Everything ends now.
You end now.

1279
01:35:56,006 --> 01:35:57,966
I surrender.
I surrender.

1280
01:35:58,091 --> 01:36:00,719
Hook me and book me.

1281
01:36:03,430 --> 01:36:05,808
Come over right there.

1282
01:36:06,642 --> 01:36:10,687
Put it out. One for
transport. Goddamn.

1283
01:36:10,771 --> 01:36:13,440
Tom Ludlow, he's got his man now.

1284
01:36:18,946 --> 01:36:24,159
I've found you
and I've made you...possible.

1285
01:36:27,287 --> 01:36:29,498
Now you need me more than ever, Tom.

1286
01:36:30,582 --> 01:36:33,961
What did you think I'd do
when I found out?

1287
01:36:36,713 --> 01:36:39,424
Wait, man.
Wait.

1288
01:36:41,051 --> 01:36:42,427
Wait.

1289
01:36:47,850 --> 01:36:49,434
In my wall.

1290
01:36:51,645 --> 01:36:54,148
It is all there in the wall.

1291
01:36:55,399 --> 01:36:57,860
These secrets, they're killing us.

1292
01:37:05,701 --> 01:37:07,536
???, open it up.

1293
01:37:11,123 --> 01:37:13,500
Open it up.
Tear it down.

1294
01:37:27,014 --> 01:37:28,849
Tear it down.

1295
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,023
Hit it.

1296
01:37:40,319 --> 01:37:41,778
Here it is.

1297
01:37:50,621 --> 01:37:53,040
This is my power.

1298
01:37:55,125 --> 01:37:57,753
This is my crown.

1299
01:37:59,338 --> 01:38:01,757
I'm the king of secrets, Tom.

1300
01:38:02,591 --> 01:38:04,760
I know which city council man is
doing lines,

1301
01:38:04,843 --> 01:38:06,637
I know who likes boys.

1302
01:38:06,762 --> 01:38:09,932
I know who's selling contracts.
I know who's beaten his wife.

1303
01:38:10,015 --> 01:38:13,936
I own them!
Even the Chief is in my pocket, Tom.

1304
01:38:15,187 --> 01:38:19,525
How you think that I've been able
to protect you all these years?

1305
01:38:20,609 --> 01:38:25,531
What do you think is it you're doing?
All these missions.

1306
01:38:27,324 --> 01:38:30,744
How do you think you're able
to touch the untouchables?

1307
01:38:32,287 --> 01:38:34,206
I'm gonna be chief!

1308
01:38:34,873 --> 01:38:36,667
I will be chief!

1309
01:38:36,875 --> 01:38:38,669
I will be mayor!

1310
01:38:39,670 --> 01:38:42,172
This is our world, Tom.

1311
01:38:42,756 --> 01:38:44,800
So let's take it.

1312
01:38:45,175 --> 01:38:47,177
Is that why you put a hit on Washington?

1313
01:38:47,344 --> 01:38:49,680
Why you tried to kill me?

1314
01:38:49,805 --> 01:38:52,349
So you can keep stuffing
money in your wall?

1315
01:38:52,474 --> 01:38:54,643
But this is our money.

1316
01:38:55,602 --> 01:38:57,396
The unit's.

1317
01:38:58,647 --> 01:39:00,315
Who do you think paid for

1318
01:39:00,399 --> 01:39:03,318
Silky's defense, doing
all those law suits?

1319
01:39:05,237 --> 01:39:07,447
Who's going to pay for your retirement?

1320
01:39:08,699 --> 01:39:11,660
I just corrected a
flaw in the system, Tom.

1321
01:39:11,994 --> 01:39:15,247
This is about cops helping cops.

1322
01:39:17,124 --> 01:39:22,379
And if a teacher
or a fireman could do it,

1323
01:39:22,504 --> 01:39:24,381
they would do it, too.

1324
01:39:27,342 --> 01:39:30,721
What happened to just
locking up bad people?

1325
01:39:33,182 --> 01:39:35,934
We're all bad, Tom.

1326
01:39:55,078 --> 01:39:57,623
You were my best friend.

1327
01:40:02,586 --> 01:40:04,963
We were family.

1328
01:40:37,746 --> 01:40:39,498
Drop it, Ludlow.

1329
01:40:50,425 --> 01:40:52,344
It's been enough killing.

1330
01:40:57,224 --> 01:40:59,268
I came as soon as you called.

1331
01:40:59,935 --> 01:41:01,854
Guess you're first on scene.

1332
01:41:05,607 --> 01:41:07,609
No, you were.

1333
01:41:15,826 --> 01:41:20,539
Looks like Jack's friends
got greedy, came after the money.

1334
01:41:21,915 --> 01:41:24,001
Is that what it looks like?

1335
01:41:26,962 --> 01:41:29,256
This your plan, Captain?

1336
01:41:29,882 --> 01:41:33,135
Just sit back and
let us all kill each other?

1337
01:41:33,218 --> 01:41:35,179
You were the plan.

1338
01:41:37,806 --> 01:41:39,933
No one else could touch him.

1339
01:41:40,601 --> 01:41:44,938
Once your eyes were opened,
there was no other outcome.

1340
01:41:49,401 --> 01:41:51,403
Decisions were made, Tom,

1341
01:41:51,945 --> 01:41:55,407
- by powerful men with powerful secrets.
- Captain?

1342
01:41:56,617 --> 01:41:58,535
They were afraid of Jack

1343
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:00,537
and they asked me to help.

1344
01:42:02,748 --> 01:42:08,295
One day, you will pass the chief
in the hall and he will give you a nod.

1345
01:42:08,712 --> 01:42:10,464
And you will know why.

1346
01:42:13,884 --> 01:42:15,761
Because you were right, Tom.

1347
01:42:16,804 --> 01:42:18,263
We do need you.
