It's all right.

Oh, calm your nerves, baby.

23
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:56,936
It ain't nothing
but an old jar.

24
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,015
- All right, guys,
let's mount up.

- All right,
you guys behave in there.

52
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,691

on liberal interest groups,

53
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,268
especially those
on environmental fronts,

54
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,737
to warn their constituencies
Bush could win.

55
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,535
- Another apparently warm day
for November,

56
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,940
with temperatures topping out
in the mid 60s.

57
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,369
Traffic on the southbound 84
continues to be slow

58
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,708

67
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,967

71
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,544

We get a hair show

with Lavosha again?

75
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:23,813
- Mm-hmm.

76
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,390
We've been
practicing for months.

77
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,686
I'm hoping to win enough
to start up at junior college.

78
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,319
- Oh, good luck
to you, honey.

79
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,419
- Thank you.

80
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,725

85
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,279
- Mm-hmm.

86
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,254
Sherice,
take him my good bowl there.

87
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,257
Hold it with both hands.

88
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,726
My grandma gave me that
from Alabama.

89
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:03,887
- Bye-bye, Grandma.

90
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,020

102
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,608
No, stay here.

Sherice, baby,
it's okay.

109
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,226
Come here.

110
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,535
- We got one
jumping the east fence.

111
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:18,763
- Roger that.

112
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:27,976

[helicopter blades whirring]

117
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,366
Ah!

118
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,268
- The Gore campaign calls it
the closing argument.

119
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,465
The vice president laid out
what he believes

120
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,702
is the best case
for a Gore presidency.

121
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,506
- Yo, Dee,
can I get a refill?

122
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:01,910
- Sure thing, Julie.

123
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,349
Don't need
anything else?

124
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,578
- No.

125
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,093
- Are you Dee Roberts?

126
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,991
Dee Roberts?

127
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,295

What did I do?

128
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,391
Will you tell me
what I did?

- I think--I think
it's my parking tickets.

133
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,333
I'm sorry, Doreen.

134
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:32,934
- Parking tickets?
This is ridiculous.

135
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,342
I'll pay
the parking tickets.

136
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,778
- Just back away, ma'am.

137
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,440
- I said,
"I'll pay the parking tickets."

138
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,415

[door slams]

148
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:31,464
- Uh, when do l
get my phone call?

149
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,663
I got to call my kids.

150
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,034

[gunshots]

152
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,228
- They was
running like cockroaches

153
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,797
from a burning torch.

154
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,058
- No one figured
on the U-Hauls.

155
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,155
You would've loved it.

156
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,758
Surprised 'em all.

157
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,336
- Beckett

158
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,429
- Of course.
He loves that thing, man.

159
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,598
Scares the shit out of 'em.

00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,902
- Mm.

161
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,170
You know, you been watching
too many cop shows.

You know that?

163
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,147
Anybody get hurt?

164
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,239
- No.

165
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,751
Got some bruises.
That's about it.

Nothing serious.

to get all caught up
in this mess, have you?

174
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,000
I mean, somebody said
that they was looking for you.

175
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,476
- Mama, you know I don't have
nothing to do with that.

Good Lord.

Hell, you can buy a car
for that much money.

183
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,184
- I know, Mama.

184
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,628
I'm sorry.

185
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,290
Mama, I'm scared in here.

186
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,527
Can you help me
out of here?

187
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,967
I'll pay you back.
I promise.

188
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,129
- When you
seeing the judge?

189
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,672
- Tomorrow morning.

190
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,742
- Tomorrow.

00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,369
I'll find it,

192
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,742
I guess, you know...

193
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,680
- Thank you, Mama.

194
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,547
Oh...

195
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:29,985
Um, tell the girls
that I will be there tomorrow.

196
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,579
I love you.

Miss Roberts?

with distributing narcotics

- Is that correct,
Mr. Beckett?

223
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,021
- It is, Your Honor.

224
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,326
- That can't be right.

225
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,165
I never had
anything to do with drugs.

226

as a not guilty plea.

Miss Roberts?

in a school zone

- Hello, Miss Roberts.

258
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:13,508
I'm David Higgins,

259
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:14,950
the lawyer
appointed by Judge Pryor

260
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,351
to represent you.

261
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:19,424
And this is Robert Foster,
assistant district attorney.

262
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,550
- Miss Roberts, you've been
indicted by a grand jury

263
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,718
as a drug dealer.

264
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:23,817
And the district attorney's

265
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,419
been gathering information
for months.

266
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,158
He has a very strong case.

267
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,631
- There must be
some kind of mistake.

268
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:32,067
- Miss Roberts, I would
advise you to be silent.

269
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,900
Mr. Foster's job
is to build a case against you.

270
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,031
- You can ask anyone.

271
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:37,574
I don't have
anything to do with drugs.

272
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,167
- Miss Roberts,
you're only hurting yourself.

273
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,747
Mr. Foster, were drugs found
on Miss Robert's person

274
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:45,043
when she was arrested?

275
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,139
- Apparently not.

276
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,514
- At her place of work?

277
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,850
In her home?

278
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,787
Does she have any record
as a drug dealer?

279
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,325
- The Harmon County
Drug Task Force

280
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,156
has conducted an extremely
impressive operation.

281
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,321
It convinced the DA.

282
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,658
It convinced
the grand jury.

283
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,198
And frankly, David,
if you saw it,

284
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,961
it'd convince you.

285
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,501
- Miss Roberts,
how many children do you have?

286
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:09,801
- Four.

287
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,002
Sherice is eight,
Sharonda's five,

288
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,306
Laquisha's four,
Tanya's two.

289
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,437
But I never done any drugs,

290
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:16,878
and I wouldn't--

291
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:18,176
- Mr. Foster,

292
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,149
could I speak with you alone
for a minute, please?

293
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,617
- Certainly.

294
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:35,026
[indecipherable speech]

295
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:40,831
- Miss Roberts, you have
a very talented lawyer.

296
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,536
And against my better judgment,

297
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,803
he has convinced me
to offer you a plea bargain.

298
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,013
- Miss Roberts,
despite what Mr. Foster

299
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,139
believes to be
the strength of his case,

300
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,684
because your record
is relatively clean

301
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,048
and due to the nature--

302
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,247
- And because of the age
and the needs of your children.

303
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,551
- He's prepared
to offer you a plea.

304
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,250
- If you plead guilty

305
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,191
to felony possession
with intent to distribute,

306
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,319
you can go home today

307
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,761

suspended sentence

308
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,297
and a small fine.

309
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,832
- But I never sold any drugs.

310
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:11,992
- Then post bail.
We'll set a court date.

311
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,264
- $70,000?

312
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,932
Or you can stay in jail
and await your pretrial hearing

313
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,839
in...
end of March.

314
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:19,933
- That's almost six months.

315
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:21,034
I can't do that.

316
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,376
What am I gonna do
about my kids?

317
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,780
- I'm sorry the burden
your behavior has imposed

318
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,317
on your children,
Miss Roberts.

319
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,546
That is why I'm prepared
to offer you a plea.

320
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,952
But be under no doubt,

321
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,284
if you don't take the plea,

322
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,882
we will prosecute you to
the fullest extent of the law.

323
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,590
Good-bye, David.

324
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,335

"the fullest extent of the law"?

325

if you plea, you a felon?

330
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,208

00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,971
- I'm bothered by it.

367
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,345
- It bothers you,
you change it.

368
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,987
- I'll come by
when I want them back.

369
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,250
- That's great.

370
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,416
Darrell,
that's just great.

371
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:48,515
Come on, y'all.

372
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,159
- # Glory #

373
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,357
- # Glory #

374
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,661
- # Glory #

375
00:18:56,768 --> 00:19:01,501
# Our Lord #

376
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,302
- You don't think
she might've been

377
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:04,397
mixed up with drugs,
do you?

378
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,875
- Heck no.

379
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,946
Dee ain't no angel, but
she sure ain't no drug dealer.

380
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:09,240
- Sherice is fighting.
- What?

381
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,576
- Grandma,
Sherice is fighting.

382
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:11,774
- What's going on?
Come here.

383
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,408
- Let go!
Ow!

384
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,508
- Cut that out!

385
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,780
Don't you push her!

386
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:16,912
Sherice!

387
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,512
Acting like that
in your Sunday clothes.

388
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:19,716
Quit it!
Stop it!

389
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,122
- Come on.
Stop that this instant.

390
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:22,386
- Hey, hey.

391
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:26,555
- This is what the Lord expects
from you on the Sabbath?

392
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,428
Sherice, Chantrelle,
what's wrong?

393
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:29,694
- She grabbed me.

394
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,359
- 'Cause you called my mama
a drug dealer.

395
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,267
- Your mama
is a drug dealer.

396
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,361
- Oh, oh, wait a minute!

397
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,462
- Stop that now.

398
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,836
- Come on,
not another word

399
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,409
from either one of you,
not another word.

400
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,499
Did y'all
see this here?

401
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:40,669
Y'all see this here?

402
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,270
This thing done tricked down
to the children.

403
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:46,146
Now, I wonder
where they got that from?

404
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,879
Half of our congregation

405
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:50,887
is in trouble with the law,

406
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:54,390
some that did wrong
and some that didn't.

407
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,586
Sherice...

408
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,720
Chantrelle...

409
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,661
I want you...

410
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:08,198
- Lord, have mercy.

411
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,404
- Thanks, Gladys.

412
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,680
- Dee Roberts.

413
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:19,773
- How I look?

414
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,581
- You look great.

415
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:23,677
- Thanks.

416
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,418
- Dee?

417
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:31,518
Dee!
- T en minutes.

418
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,359
- There she is.
I see her.

419
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:34,454
- Hey, Mama.

420
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,966
- Hey,
say hi to your mama.

421
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,764
- Hey, babies.

422
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,894
- Hey, Mama.

423
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,529
- Do you see her?
Come here, sweetie pie.

424
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,107
- Ah.

425
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,368
- You look good, Dee.

426
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:45,909
- Look at my hair, Mama.

427
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,569
I am not looking good.

428
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,668
But look at y'all,

429
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,214
how pretty you are
in your Sunday dresses.

430
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,682
- Yeah,
we been to church.

431
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:54,774
- What happened to Sherice?

432
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:55,875
- Oh, she okay.

433
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,421
She just got
into a little scuffle.

434
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,490
- Here, let me talk to her.

435
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,580
- Come on, Sherice.

436
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:01,886
Come on up
so your mom can see you.

437
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,053
Come here.
Can you see her?

438
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:05,356
Come on up here
so you can see her.

439
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,726
- Hey, baby.

440
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:07,856
- Hey, Mama.

441
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:08,955
- What happened to you?

442
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,625
- Nothing.

443
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:11,725
- Mm-mm.

444
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,065
I can see
something happened.

445
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,765
Come on.

446
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,240
- They said you were
staying in here for life.

447
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,675
They say
we're gonna be homeless.

448
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,768
[children crying]

449
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,245
- Everybody, calm down,
calm down.

450
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:24,815
This is all right.
It's all right.

451
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,781
You are not
gonna be homeless.

452
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,978
They crazy,
'cause your mama,

453
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,179
your mama's coming home.

454
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,347
She's coming home
real soon,

455
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,946
ain't you?

456
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,047
- Mm-hmm.

457
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,751
- They offer you a plea?

458
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:37,385
- I didn't do anything,
Mama.

459
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:38,827
- Dee, everybody pleas,

460
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,955
and nobody ever's guilty.

461
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,294
- I'd be a convicted felon,
Mama.

462
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,891
- You'd be home
with your girls.

463
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,299
- They'd throw me
out the apartment.

464
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,701
I'd lose my food stamps,

465
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,136
the money
for Sharonda's medicine.

466
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,208
- You gonna lose all that anyway
if you go to prison.

467
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,642
- Didn't you always say,
"The truth will set you free"?

468
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:54,871
- [chuckles]

469
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,641
Girl,
that's in the afterlife.

470
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:57,908
God care about the truth.

471
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:00,985
The DA don't
give a shit about the truth.

472
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,987
He'd lock niggers up
till judgment day.

473
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,078
- Time's up.

474
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,623
- Dee?

475
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:09,193
Darrell has been coming back
to get the girls.

476
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,762
So you think about that
when you thinking of what to do.

477
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:12,852
- He still with Claudia?

478
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:14,454
- Mm-hmm.

479
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,659
- Mama, don't leave the girls
alone with her.

480
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:19,032
- Dee, I am doing
the best I can.

481
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,866
- Mama?
- He is their daddy.

482
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:23,270
- Mama, do not leave them
alone with her.

483
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,275
Promise me, Mama.
- Think about that plea.

484
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:26,503
- Mama?
Mama?

485
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:27,635
Mama, you know what she's done--

486
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:28,735
- Say bye to your mama.

487
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,371
- Bye, Mama.

488
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:31,471
- Bye.

489
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,312
- Oh, babies, bye.

490
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:34,646
- Love you.

491
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:35,742
- Bye, babies.

492
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,219
Bye, babies.
I love you, Mama.

493
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:38,311
- Dee!
- Bye!

494
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:39,412
- Bye, Dee.
We love you.

495
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,616
Come on, baby.

496
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:43,251
Let's get
out of this jail.

497
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:47,355
They love to see black folks
up in this place.

498
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:48,865
- To the desk and he said,

499
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,026
"You know how many times I've
been through this with you?

500
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,626
"I'm gonna tell you right now,
you gonna have to arrest me,

501
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:53,727
'cause I don't give a shit"--

502
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,466
- Excuse me.

503
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,168
Do y'all know
where I might find Judge Pryor?

504
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:01,006
[knocking on door]

505
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:02,102
- Judge Pryor?

506
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,545
- Yes, Sam?

507
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,548
- I have someone here
who'd like to speak with you.

508
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,117
- Yeah, come on in.

509
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,016
- Appreciate it.

510
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:11,021
- And I think
the U.S. Supreme Court--

511
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,591
- We--
we've counted all the votes.

512
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,353
We counted them
on election day.

513
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,189
- We haven't counted them.
- The machine...

514
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:19,058
- Hey, y'all.

515
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:20,563
- Hi, Alma.

516
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:21,996
- Girl, how you doing?

517
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,534
- This is what
I called y'all about.

518
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:27,400
- Girl, how Dee doing?
We sure miss her.

519
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,235
- She--
she all right.

520
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,673
The judge say
he'll lower Dee's bail

521
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,267
if enough folks
sign this here.

522
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:37,542
It say you have never seened her
doing or selling drugs.

523
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,640
That color's
sure looking good on you, girl.

524
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,309
- I love it.
I love it.

525
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,751
- I think
I want to bump it up, though.

526
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,048
- Give Dee our love.

527
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,647
- And tell her we sure
miss her around here, okay?

528
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,918
- Y'all know I will.

529
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,088
Tamika,
I need you to sign.

530
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:53,789
[chatter]

531
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,162
- Listen up.
Listen to me now.

532
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,256
Listen to me.

533
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:57,665
Year after year,

534
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:01,865
we have endured these raids
on our community.

535
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:05,807
And l, for one,
have had enough.

536
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:09,108
So I put in a call
to my old friend

537
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:12,513
Joe Fischer
up at Baylor Law School.

538
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,177
Professor Fischer
has a long history

539
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,085
of fighting
for what's right here in Texas.

540
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,384
And we thank him for that.

541
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:23,621
[applause]

542
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:26,720
Well, Joe didn't let us down,

543
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,163
'cause next thing I know,

544
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:32,498
I'm talking to a Mr. David Cohen
at the ACLU.

545
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,162
Mr. Cohen,
thank you.

546
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:35,796
Thank you for coming.

547
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,670
- Thank you, Reverend.

548
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,040
My associate
Byron Hill and l

549
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,342
appreciate your inviting us
here tonight.

550
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:47,612
What's happening in Melody is
happening all over our country.

551
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:50,552
Drug task forces
use military tactics

552
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,555
to terrorize poor people.

553
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:56,787
And drug laws selectively target
people of color.

554
00:24:56,895 --> 00:25:00,558
Meanwhile, federal money
goes to the counties

555
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,394
that convict
the most people.

556
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,993
And plea bargains
are aggressively pushed

557
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,868
to hasten those convictions.

558
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:11,943
Now, can anyone guess
what percentage

559
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,307
of the criminal cases
in our country

560
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:16,175
are settled
by plea bargains?

561
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,245
Just guess.

562
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,811
How many folks never see
a jury of their peers?

563
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,015
- Half.

564
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,251
- 95%.

565
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,353
For most people, the penalties
of not taking the plea

566
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,364
are so frightening
that even if they're innocent,

567
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:35,660
they plead guilty.

568
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:37,530
- My son James got arrested
up in the projects.

569
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:38,625
- Uh-huh.

570
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:39,863
- Can you
help him post bail?

571
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:44,567
- The ACLU
does not post bail money.

572
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,974
But we do offer
legal advice

573
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,238
and expert testimony.

574
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:51,008
- Young man,
I'm grateful for your offer,

575
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:54,017
but I don't know
that an ACLU Yankee lawyer

576
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,110
can help my child
with no Texas jury.

577
00:25:56,221 --> 00:26:00,351
- Look, he's here,
and he wants to help.

578
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:03,222
'Cause there ain't no way
my son gonna get a fair trial

579
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:05,796
as long as Beckett
cuts the cords.

580
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:09,799
Now, the DA wants Brian
to take an eight-year plea.

581
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:13,928
If he doesn't,
they pushing for 25 years.

582
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:19,272
- The story you're telling
is exactly why we're here.

583
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:24,280
- Our oldest boy
fought charges three years ago.

584
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:27,044
He didn't stand a chance.

585
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:30,019
He's in for 1 5 years.

586
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:37,521
- Yeah, yeah, something
really exciting and fun.

587
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:39,927
- [baby talk]

588
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:42,397
- Count to 17.

589
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,127
- That could be fun.

590
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,601
Well, do you want to start it
or shall l?

591
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,104
- I'll start it, Big Bird.

592
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,731
- Okay, you start.

593
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:53,208
- One...
- Two...

594
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,279
- Tanya, come on, so I can
change your diaper, girl.

595
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,438
Come on.

596
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,413
- Three?
- Three!

597
00:26:58,516 --> 00:26:59,983
Y eah, three!

598
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,553
Then we have, um...

599
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:03,643
four!

600
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,780
- Come on, T anya.
Your diaper got to be full.

601
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,587
- [laughing]

602
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:11,958
- Five!

603
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:16,796
- Texas law says
a grand jury

604
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:19,768
can indict them on the word
of a single informant.

605
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:22,396
- So all I have to do
is accuse you...

606
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:25,237
- And then I can be indicted
and arrested,

607
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,743
and I'm told
to take the plea or else.

608
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:30,041
- And this system
is an abomination.

609
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,844
Poor black folks
are easy pickins.

610
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:34,509
- But we can
change the system.

611
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:37,816
We're gonna hit this DA
really hard.

612
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,355
- Up in the city,

613
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,291
a DA
may not be a big deal,

614
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,830
but down here,

615
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:49,991
he rules like a king.

616
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:53,195
Beckett's been the DA
for nine years.

617
00:27:53,304 --> 00:28:00,767
White folks vote for him
'cause he keeps the town quiet.

618
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:04,246
Black folks...

619
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,283
half of 'em
are too lazy to vote,

620
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:10,650
and the other half can't vote
'cause they're felons.

621
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:16,887
I'll find you
your lead plaintiff,

622
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:20,761
but they gonna be in
for a hell of a ride.

623
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,675
- Roberts.

624
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:34,142
Your lawyer's here.

625
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:35,439
- You got
what I been asking for?

626
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,844
I really need 'em.

627
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:39,883
- You too good to wad up toilet
paper like everybody else?

628
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:41,975
Let's go.

629
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:45,614
- DA's
playing hardball with us.

630
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,282
He says he might
withdraw his plea offer

631
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,019
if you don't take it soon.

632
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,163
Look, I've learned a little bit
about their case.

633
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,500
All right,
the DA has an informant

634
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:04,166
and audio tapes
of people selling him drugs.

635
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:06,300
The informant claims
he bought crack from you.

636
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,140
The tapes confirm it.

637
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:12,148
And two police offers say
they witnessed the whole thing.

638
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,244
It's pretty strong stuff,
Miss Roberts.

639
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:22,215
- It's bullshit.

640
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:25,319
[gunshots]

641
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:33,299
- Sam Conroy?

642
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:34,496
- Y eah.

643
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,097
- Hi, I'm David Cohen
with the ACLU.

644
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,574
Joe Fischer up at Baylor
told me I might find you here.

645
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,804
Do you have a second?

646
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:44,780
There's a case I'd like
to discuss with you.

647
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,617
- Girl, anyone that can make
Laquathia look that good

648
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,191
is a damn genius.

649
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,554
- You just jealous.

650
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,127
- [chuckles]

651
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,229
- Gladys Williams?

652
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:02,663
Come on,
you're going home.

653
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,394
- Going home?
Gladys?

654
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:05,491
- I took the plea.

655
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,935
I'm sorry.

656
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,438
I'm just
not as strong as you are.

657
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,838
- Don't--
don't worry about it.

658
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:17,938
Gladys, you got to do
what you think is right.

659
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:22,509
So you know...

660
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,609
All right.

661
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:25,086
- Bye, girl.

662
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,990
- Say hi to my babies.

663
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:12,100
- Leona?

664
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,693
- Hey.

665
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,466
- Hey.

666
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:20,440
I got your medication.

667
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:23,541
How are you feeling?

668
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,276
- I'm good.

669
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,373
Thank you.

670
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,046
- [mumbling]

671
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:34,681
- What are you reading?

672
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:36,885
You've been snortin'
and sputterin' over there

673
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:37,984
for an hour.

674
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,461
- Well,
this background on a case

675
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,589
Joe Fischer
recommended me for.

676
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,326
- Joe Fischer?
- Yeah.

677
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:45,425
- Well, that's flattering.

678
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:46,696
- Well, I suppose.

679
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:51,741
But what it is
is that the ACLU

680
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:54,471
is trying to sue
Calvin Beckett

681
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,841
and a whole lot
of other people,

682
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:59,246
including your employer,
the sheriff,

683
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,648
'cause of the raids
down in Melody.

684
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:05,052
They're claiming
it's a racial thing,

685
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:06,384
racial bias.

686
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:11,617
- You think it's true?

687
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:14,789
- Maybe.

688
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:17,732
Probably.

689
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:19,735
Maybe.

690
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:23,671
But you know, racist intent
is very hard to prove.

691
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:28,371
And I mean,
I got to work down here.

692
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,277
I don't want to get tagged
with the ACLU people.

693
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:32,781
That's...

694
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,317
- So you're not
gonna do it?

695
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:35,750
- I don't know.

696
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,418
I don't know.

697
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,538
buzz!

698
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:34,375
[indecipherable speech]

699
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:45,312
- I didn't order apple pie.

700
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:48,586
I ordered tuna on rye.

701
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,321
The pie
rhymes with the rye.

702
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:52,691
- Oh.

703
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,822
[door opens]

704
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,160
- Mama!

705
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,599
- Oh.

706
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,330
[laughing]

707
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:01,700
Come here.
Come to your mommy.

708
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,603
- They got me
watching Sesame Street,

709
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,039
and I don't like that show.

710
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:06,132
- [laughs]

711
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,973
- Here's the sweetie one.

712
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,944
Oh, dang.

713
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,208
- Oh.

714
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,806
- That your mama?

715
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,408
- [laughing]

716
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,511
- I told you
she was coming back.

717
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,556
Yeah.

718
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,454
- Where Sherice at?

719
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,016
Mm.

720
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:48,085
You been brushing this?

721
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:50,154
[chuckles]

722
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,456
Looks like it need
a little bit of a treatment.

723
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:58,895
Mind if we work on it tonight?

724
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:09,065
You been scared
I wasn't coming home?

725
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:16,836
It's okay, baby.

726
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,973
I'm here now, okay?

727
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,478
I'll never...

728
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:27,615
ever leave you again.

729
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,386
I won't let
anything happen to you.

730
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,560
All right, baby?

731
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:30,019
- Let there be no doubt,

732
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:33,784
while I strongly disagree
with the court's decision,

733
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:34,880
I accept it.

734
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:37,392
- [clears throat]

735
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:38,860
There she is.

736
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,499
- Whole system's crazy, Dee.

737
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,092
Take the Mexicans.

738
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,899
No one else
will work in the kitchen.

739
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,336
But if you hire them,

740
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,238
government comes and busts
for hiring illegals.

741
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,038
- Doreen,
I need my job back.

742
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,547
- Dee, how many years
you been working here?

743
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,585
Six?
- Seven.

744
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:06,851
- Dee, after the police
came and got you,

745
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,482
they came back...

746
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:10,083
twice.

747
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:12,424
First time,
looking for drugs in your stuff.

748
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,861
And then a week later,

749
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:16,832
to talk to me about the papers
on my guys in the kitchen.

750
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,701
I can't be fighting
with the DA.

751
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,271
- Don't worry about it.

752
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:28,538
- Please, take it.

753
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:31,046
- Don't worry about it.
- Take it.

754
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:33,048
Please.

755
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,517
- Thank you.

756
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:43,389
- You're welcome.

757
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:46,088
- Um...

758
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,097
I'm sorry.

759
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,188
- Me too.

760
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,860
- So did you get a chance
to read the material

761
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:22,990
that I gave you?

762
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,035
- What do you need
local counsel for?

763
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,105
Doesn't the ACLU
have enough lawyers?

764
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:30,765
- We need insight
into the local justice system.

765
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:31,864
- It's simple.

766
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,841
The DA
decides what he wants,

767
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,070
the cops
go and get it for him,

768
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:37,477
and the judges
bless what they have done.

769
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:42,179
- Are you hostile toward
this case for some reason,

770
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:43,480
Mr. Conroy?

771
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,347
- Mr. Cohen, when Joe Fischer
recommended me to you,

772
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,119
did he tell you,
before I became a lawyer,

773
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:50,523
I'd been a drug cop
for ten years

774
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,323
and that I trained
the task force officers

775
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,727
you're planning on suing?

776
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:58,727
- Mr. Fischer told me
you were a man of principle,

777
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,235
a fair man.

778
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,828
Does what happened
at Arlington Springs

779
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:02,997
seem fair to you?

780
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,701
- Not much
seems fair to me these days,

781
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,778
Mr. Cohen,
so I deal in practicalities.

782
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:10,642
You're asking me to sue
everybody I ever met

783
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,010
for racial discrimination.

784
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,708
Now, you know
where we are down here?

785
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:16,184
You might as well ask me
to stick a shotgun up my ass

786
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,517
and blow my head off.

787
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,918
- Well, that's very colorful.

788
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,360
I apologize
for wasting your time.

789
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:33,497
- You don't
have to be sorry.

790
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,162
You're just doing
what you think is right,

791
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:37,968
and despite how it may look,
so am l.

792
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,710
But I got to live down here.

793
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:45,748
You're gonna be able to go back
where you come from.

794
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,249
I'm gonna ask you again.

795
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,216
Why do you want
local counsel?

796
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:55,058
- We intend
to file very quickly.

797
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,617
To handle discovery,
depositions,

798
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,594
and a trial,

799
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:04,691
I need somebody who knows
how to navigate shit down here,

800
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:09,501
somebody to whom witnesses
and a local jury can relate.

801
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:12,542
I think we both know
that isn't me.

802
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:14,042
- [chuckles]

803
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,715
Well, that's a sensible answer
there, Mr. Cohen.

804
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,816
[sighs]

805
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,252
Who is your plaintiff?

806
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:29,224
- Hello.
Is your mom home?

807
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:31,089
- Who's that, Sherice?

808
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,995
- Hi, are you Dee Roberts?

809
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,191
- Mm-hmm.

810
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,531
- Hi, I'm David Cohen
with the ACLU,

811
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:42,401
and this is Sam Conroy.

812
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:46,738
Reverend Sanders suggested
that we come talk to you.

813
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,574
- Reverend Sanders?

814
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,669
Mm-hmm.

815
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:51,770
Okay.

816
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:54,043
Bye, babies.

817
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:55,277
Get into Mommy's room.

818
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,614
Got a visitor.

819
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,280
Sharonda, make sure your
sisters keep quiet, all right?

820
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,220
All right.

821
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:05,420
- So, Miss Roberts,

822
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:08,020
what has happened to you
and others here in Melody

823
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,861
is simply wrong.

824
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:13,198
The ACLU wants to make sure
that it doesn't happen again.

825
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,398
And we plan to sue
the district attorney,

826
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:17,872
the county,

827
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,272
the drug task force,

828
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:23,142
and the policemen
involved in the raids.

829
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:27,013
We'd like to do it
in your name.

830
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:29,108
- Are you kidding me?

831
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,518
You want her to sue
Calvin Beckett?

832
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:32,953
- Yes, ma'am.

833
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:34,456
- Y'all must be
the ones doing drugs

834
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:37,152
if you think my daughter's
gonna sue the DA

835
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,957
and Harmon County,
Texas.

836
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:42,828
- Would y'all excuse me
for a second, please?

837
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:48,268
- Huh.

838
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:55,834
Hey.

839
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:57,607
Mm-mm.
Mm-mm.

840
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:03,750
Since when
did you start smoking?

841
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,845
- Since I spent
21 days in jail.

842
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:08,447
- I can't believe Reverend
Sanders sent them round here,

843
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,584
talking about sue Beckett.

844
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,218
You can't beat Beckett.

845
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:13,762
- I would need to.

846
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,491
He wants to put me in prison
for 1 6 years.

847
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,897
- Beckett
don't care nothing about you.

848
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,629
You take the plea,
he will leave you alone.

849
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:20,829
You stay to yourself,

850
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:22,371
he ain't gonna bother you
never again.

851
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:24,134
- Why should l
have to keep to myself?

852
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,141
I did not do anything.

853
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:27,835
- Dee,
it ain't always about you.

854
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:29,242
You got kids
to take care of.

855
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:31,712
- Mama, these police
been raiding these projects

856
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:32,804
since I was a kid.

857
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:36,978
Now they done
started on my kids.

858
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:40,079
Look at Sherice in there.

859
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,181
It scared her
half to death.

860
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:44,090
You think it's gonna stop
'cause I plead guilty?

861
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:45,183
- Excuse me.

862
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,923
Why is that
any of your business?

863
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:52,332
- After what
they done to me, Mama,

864
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:54,802
they made it my business.

865
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,065
- Dee!

866
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:57,470
Dee, wait a minute!
- No, Mama.

867
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,118
I want to help.
- Great.

868
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:10,846
- May l?

869
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:12,422
- Please.

870
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,284
- Miss Roberts,
I know Calvin Beckett.

871
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:19,453
I know him personally.

872
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:24,262
And filing this suit
against him,

873
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:27,826
it may make him
change his plans.

874
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,236
But more than likely,

875
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:33,640
he's gonna come after you
even harder.

876
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:35,507
He may come after you
very hard.

877
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,911
You need to remember that you
still have criminal charges

878
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:41,007
pending against you.

879
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,107
- He's right.

880
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:49,782
- [mumbling]

881
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:53,989
He ain't gonna leave me alone
unless I plead guilty.

882
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:56,293
And I ain't doing that.

883
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,836
So...

884
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:01,564
what exactly
do you need me to do?

885
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:14,448
- So why does it seem
such a hard choice, Sam?

886
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:16,678
- Well, it makes me take sides.

887
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:19,722
It'll seem kind of like
a political thing, doesn't it?

888
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,188
And I'm not
a political person.

889
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:22,553
You know that.

890
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,025
And I mean,

891
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:27,291
well, okay, I'm gonna sue
the district attorney down here.

892
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:31,266
I mean, the establishment would
be done with me, wouldn't it?

893
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:34,496
And Leona has been sick.

894
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:35,833
And we can't afford--

895
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:40,069
- Then why are you thinking
about doing it at all?

896
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,379
- Hey, did you know that
when I was in high school,

897
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:47,040
I was in West Louisiana,

898
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:50,951
and used to work
at a town pool out there?

899
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:54,684
And blacks and whites were just
beginning to swim together.

900
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:58,523
The idea wasn't very popular
with anybody at that time.

901
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:01,996
And one afternoon,

902
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:04,693
I was out there,

903
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:07,498
and there were
two blacks in the pool,

904
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:10,300
and there was one black man
in the shower room.

905
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:12,398
It was in the pool house

906
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:14,409
where I was mopping down
the floor in there.

907
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:17,878
And this white man
comes in and he says,

908
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:20,779
"Sam, get out of here."

909
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,442
And I said,
"Well, I work here.

910
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,043
I'm mopping up the floor.
What do you"--

911
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:25,587
And he said,
"Get the hell out of here."

912
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:26,678
And I said,
"l can't do that.

913
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:27,882
I'm not finished
mopping up."

914
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:29,356
And he pulled out
a tire iron and said,

915
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,951
"Boy, you get your ass
out of here right now."

916
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,962
And I did.

917
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,398
And as I'm running out,

918
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:40,561
all these men
come running in.

919
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:44,539
They're carrying metal rods,
sticks, pipes.

920
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:49,271
And as I'm running out,
I heard, you know,

921
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:51,870
the sound...

922
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:59,987
And, um...

923
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,081
man died that night.

924
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:10,356
Couple weeks later,

925
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:12,662
the FBl
came to my house.

926
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,738
And they wanted to know
what I'd seen.

927
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:23,578
- What did you tell them?

928
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,205
- I didn't say anything.

929
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:35,388
I knew
who those men were,

930
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:38,052
and I didn't say anything.

931
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:50,767
- Lavosha.

932
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:53,069
- Hey, Dee, girl.

933
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:55,145
Baby, how you doing?

934
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:57,577
It's so good to see you.

935
00:46:57,681 --> 00:46:58,670
- Mm, I'm...

936
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:01,080
[chuckles]

937
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:04,615
- There.

938
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:06,586
A whole new you.

939
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:08,453
- Wow, thank you, Vosha.

940
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,993
I promise,
when I get a new job...

941
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:12,288
- Mm-mm.

942
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:14,296
Don't worry about it.
It's on me, honey.

943
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:16,059
Anytime.

944
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:19,098
- Thank you so much.

945
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:22,104
- Aw, sweetie.

946
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:23,537
- This is good.

947
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,130
- Y eah.

948
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,345
- Okay.

949
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,914
Well, okay.

950
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,890
Well, it's nice to meet you,
Miss Roberts.

951
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:46,087
Do you think you could
start next Monday?

952
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,458
- Can I start sooner?

953
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:49,862
- We're just gonna do
a background check first.

954
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:52,663
You know, arrest record
and all that stuff.

955
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:56,330
But it shouldn't take long.

956
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,907
- It was nice to meet you.

957
00:47:58,008 --> 00:47:59,339
- Nice to meet you.

958
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:12,611
- No.

959
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:13,815
- Look...

960
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:15,357
- No, we're not hiring
at the moment.

961
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:17,154
No.

962
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:18,353
- I'm a hard worker.

963
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:20,293
You won't
have to pay me much.

964
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,126
- I'm sorry.

965
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:25,531
- I'll do dishes,
bus tables, anything.

966
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:26,864
- No.
- Come on.

967
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,631
- I said no.

968
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,647

- [speaking Spanish]

971
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:48,220
Here, everybody
has to do everything:

972
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:50,623
clean the bathrooms,

973
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:51,716
scrub the dishes,

974
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:53,193
and go to the warehouse
to get supplies.

975
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:54,286
Thanks.

976
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:57,890
- That's all right for me.

977
00:48:58,001 --> 00:48:59,696
- It's minimum wage,
no benefits.

978
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:02,738
- That's okay.

979
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:04,898
- [speaking Spanish]

980
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,477
All right,
we'll try it for a month.

981
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,915
- Thank you.

982
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:17,350
I'll do a good job.

983
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,115
You'll see.

984
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:23,689
Look what I got.
- Mama!

985
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,056
- [laughing]

986
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:26,390
Look what I got.

987
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:27,827
- Christmas tree!

988
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:29,455
We got a Christmas tree!

989
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:31,261
- We got a Christmas tree!

990
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:32,426
Who's gonna help me decorate?

991
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:33,594
Who's gonna help me decorate?

992
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:34,830
- Me!

993
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:36,735
- The whole truth
and nothing but the truth,

994
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,273
so help you God?

995
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,206
- I do.

996
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,868
- Mr. Porter,

997
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:46,109
on August the 1 4th, did you buy
drugs from the defendant?

998
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:47,376
- Yes.

999
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,974
- And did anyone
witness this?

1000
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:50,075
- Yes.

1001
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:52,712
Well, no--
not exactly.

1002
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,518
I recorded it
on a tape recorder

1003
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:56,285
that the police
had gave me.

1004
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:57,485
Are you sure
there were drugs?

1005
00:49:57,594 --> 00:49:58,652
- Yes.

1006
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:00,195
- How are you sure?

1007
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:02,925
- Well, I taste them.

1008
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:05,934
And when I brought them
to the police,

1009
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:07,765
they put them
on a little piece of glass

1010
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:09,236
and put the stuff on it
and it turned--

1011
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,170
- Mr. Porter,
thank you.

1012
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:12,673
That'll be all for now.

1013
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:18,408
- Mr. Porter, have you ever been
in a mental institution?

1014
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:19,846
- Objection, Your Honor,
this is--

1015
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,008
- Overruled.

1016
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:24,781
- Mr. Porter,
I repeat,

1017
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:30,258
have you ever been
in a mental institution?

1018
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,349
- Yes.

1019
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:33,326
- And who sent you there?

1020
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:34,795
- He did.

1021
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:36,229
- Mr. Beckett?

1022
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,333
- Yes.

1023
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:41,836
- And were you afraid--

1024
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:44,668
- I guess we just found
our first deposition.

1025
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:48,905
- Your Honor,
I move we recess for lunch.

1026
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:51,947
- Court is adjourned
until 1 :00 p.m.

00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:07,028
- Hello, Calvin.

1029
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:08,461
How are you?

1030
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,260
- Calvin Beckett.
I don't believe I know you.

1031
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:11,527
You visiting?

1032
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:13,603
- David Cohen.
I'm gonna be here for a while.

1033
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:16,103

seeing you around.

1034
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:18,367
- I look forward to that.

Hey, Grace.

- What you
doing here so soon?

1040
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,925
I wasn't expecting you.
Everything all right?

1041
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:43,829
- Yeah, everything's okay.
Where's Sherice at?

1042
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:44,923
- She at basketball.

1043
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:47,663
- Where the girls at?

1044
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:55,039
Mama?

1045
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:57,909
- That's their daddy, Dee.

as lay a hand on my girl--

get them back!

1080
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,607
- You best
listen to your mama, Dee.

1081
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:04,702
- Uh-huh.

1082
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:05,906
- You know
what friends I got.

1083
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,313
Police gonna be here
in a minute.

1084
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:09,044
You better stay away
from my truck, though.

1085
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:10,813
Hey!
- I want my girls!

1086
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:12,252
- All right,
now get off that truck.

1087
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,982
You know
I need that for work.

1088
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:15,785
Damn it!
Are you out your God damn mind?

1089
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:17,416
- I said I want my girls,
Darrell!

1090
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,188
- Get off my truck!

1091
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:20,695
- Dee!

1092
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:22,355
- Come on now, Dee.
You know you can't do--

1093
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:23,727
Hey!
- I'm counting to three!

1094
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,095
I want my damn kids back!

1095
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,191
- Knock that shit off!

1096
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:27,531
You better not.

1097
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:29,161
- Two!
- Dee, cool yourself.

1098
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:31,069
- Three!

1099
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:33,005
Come on, Darrell!
Come on!

1100
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:34,440
I want my damn kids!

1101
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:35,602
- Dee!

1102
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,839
- Stop!

1103
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:39,347
- Goddamn it!

1104
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,178
[siren whoops]

1105
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:45,988
- I want my damn kids.

1106
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:47,078
Come on!

1107
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:49,681
- Dee, get off that truck!

1108
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:50,782
- I want my girls.

1109
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,657
- You scaring them kids.
Come here.

1110
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:54,525
- Go on and take 'em.

1111
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:55,689
Take 'em!

1112
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:57,323
- Don't cry, baby.
Baby, I'm sorry.

1113
00:53:57,434 --> 00:53:59,368
Come here, baby.

1114
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:01,832
- I'm just
trying to protect them

1115
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:05,203
from your
insane bullshit anyway.

1116
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:07,173
- What?

1117
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:08,744
Look at my Goddamn truck.

1118
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:10,039
- You know the drill,
Miss Alma.

1119
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:11,272
- Look at this shit.
- Come on.

1120
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:12,405
- You don't
have to cuff her.

1121
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:13,504
- Get my girls
out of here.

1122
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:14,641
- I got 'em.

1123
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:18,414
Dee, I'm gonna
come and get you.

1124
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:22,389
- It's not like I won't
have 'em back soon anyway.

1125
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:33,224
Bitch.

1126
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,403
- Your mother told Darrell she'd
fix his car

1127
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:39,236
if he dropped the charges.

1128
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:42,470
Did she tell you that Claudia's
an accused child molester?

1129
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:45,139
- No one can blame you
for protecting your girls.

1130
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:48,513
But destroying Darrell's car
just wasn't smart.

1131
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,142
- Worked, didn't it?

1132
00:54:50,253 --> 00:54:53,416
- Dee, we get
hundreds of letters every week

1133
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:54,854
from people who need help,

1134
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,950
people, frankly,
just as deserving as you.

1135
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:01,292
We have the resources for
one major case on this issue,

1136
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:03,662
and I chose you.

1137
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:05,826
I need you
to stay out of trouble.

1138
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:07,903
Can you do that?

1139
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:14,399
Thank you.

1140
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:20,379
- 35,000 thousand people
at eight official balls

1141
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:23,509
hang between
$1 00 and $200 a pop.

1142
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:24,746
- I don't know him that well,

1143
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:28,017
but I know him well enough
to say I know him...

1144
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:30,024
- Hello, Dee.
- Hello.

1145
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:33,391
- Have a seat.

1146
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,464
- Congratulations.

1147
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:37,692
You made the paper.

1148
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:40,201
- Yeah, lucky me.

1149
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:41,793
- I just spoke
to David Higgins.

1150
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:42,963
He should be here
any minute.

1151
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:47,476
Did he listen
to that tape with you?

1152
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:48,805
- Right there in jail.

1153
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:50,379
Wasn't nothing
but a lot of crackling

1154
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,607
and some men arguing.

1155
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:55,685
Not a woman's voice
on the tape.

1156
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:58,083
- Oh, speak of the devil.

1157
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,088
Hello, David.

1158
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,055
Have a seat.

1159
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:03,250
I think you know Dee.

1160
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,022
David Cohen,
David Higgins.

1161
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:09,121
- I'm here
because of George Bush...

1162
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:11,757
- I just can't find it.

1163
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:15,269
- Are you telling me
you lost the tape?

1164
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,068
- Well, did you call the DA
about a copy?

1165
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:20,472
- It seems theirs
is missing too.

1166
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,414
- Okay,
what about the arrest warrant

1167
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:28,109
that Dee gave you?

1168
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,516
- Well, I'm sure we'll
find it sooner or later.

1169
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,713
- Oh, come on, David.

1170
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:35,188
You can't really expect us
to believe this bullshit.

1171
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:36,952
- Well, I don't really care what
you believe.

1172
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,028
- Mr. Higgins,
at the very least,

1173
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:40,562
you're guilty
of gross dereliction

1174
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:42,062
of your responsibilities.

1175
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:43,427
And you may
very well be guilty

1176
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:44,932
of criminal obstruction
of justice.

1177
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:48,060
- You be very careful
what you say, Mr. Cohen.

1178
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:49,729
As Sam can tell you,
down here,

1179
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,204
you make enemies for life.

1180
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:53,935
Miss Roberts, let me
give you some free advice.

1181
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:55,533
You take the plea.

1182
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:56,873
You do a little time
on probation,

1183
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,675
and you go back
to your family in peace.

1184
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:00,511
Be careful
you don't get sent away

1185
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:02,107
just so some
self-important asshole

1186
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:04,277
can play civil rights lawyer.

1187
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,230
- Well, that went well.

1188
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:20,892
[knocking on door]

1189
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:23,268
- I'll get it.

1190
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:33,204
- Hi.

1191
00:57:33,316 --> 00:57:35,147
Is your mommy here?

1192
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:36,718
Would you
tell her that Mr. Moss

1193
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,550
from Child
Protective Services is here.

1194
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:42,989
[camera clicks]

1195
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:46,721
Miss Roberts, our office has
received a number of complaints

1196
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:52,097
from the girls' father,
a Mr. Darrell Hughes.

1197
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:55,069
He claims you're negligent
and abusive.

1198
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:57,605
- Do you see them,
Mr. Moss?

1199
00:57:57,707 --> 00:58:00,301
Do they look abused?

1200
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:03,277
- Well, that's what
we're here to evaluate.

1201
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:05,745
Here is your notice
for a custody hearing

1202
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:07,544
before the district attorney.

1203
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:13,349
- Calvin!

1204
00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:15,481
- Calvin, care to comment
on the jury's decision?

1205
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:16,991
- The jury made a mistake.

1206
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:18,754
Mr. Green should
never have been acquitted.

1207
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:20,796
I'm convinced he's guilty,
and he should be in jail.

1208
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:22,455
- Did the ACLU lawsuit
have anything to do

1209
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:23,998
with your decision
to drop the charges

1210
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,590
against the other defendants?

1211
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:27,863
- Look, since the jury
made clear today

1212
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:30,599
that they do not consider
Mr. Porter a credible witness,

1213
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:33,403
I'm forced to drop the charges
against everyone we arrested

1214
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,000
in the sweep in Melody.

1215
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:36,874
Make no mistake,

1216
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:39,175
I'm certain everyone
was guilty as sin.

1217
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:40,340
Just can't prove it...

1218
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:41,508
this time.

1219
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:44,985
- What about the people
who already pled guilty?

1220
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:46,282
- What about them?

1221
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:47,913
They pled guilty.

1222
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,184
They're guilty.

1223
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:50,919
- Is there gonna be...
- Calvin!

1224
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,593
- Dee, that's great news.

1225
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:57,723
- Mm.

1226
00:58:57,834 --> 00:58:59,802
But he said I'm guilty.

1227
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:01,370
- Doesn't matter
what he said.

1228
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:02,733
The charges are dropped.

1229
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:11,711
- What you think, David?

1230
00:59:11,814 --> 00:59:14,977
- Well, it's good news for you.

1231
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:17,518
And your suit
and the jury's verdict

1232
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,417
have forced Beckett
to change his plans.

1233
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:22,719
But the system
isn't changing.

1234
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:25,020
He could raid
Arlington Springs tomorrow

1235
00:59:25,128 --> 00:59:27,062
and start
all over again.

1236
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:28,755
He's not even
throwing out the convictions

1237
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:30,196
of people like Gladys,

1238
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,790
who pled guilty
under duress.

1239
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:32,890
- Excuse me.

1240
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:35,971
What does this
have to do with Dee?

1241
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:38,404
- She filed the case
against Beckett.

1242
00:59:38,508 --> 00:59:41,306
If she quits,
the case is over.

1243
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:44,141
- So you expect her
to keep going?

1244
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:47,915
What you think?

1245
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:54,280
- If Dee wants to drop the case,
now's the time to do it.

1246
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:01,858
But what David's saying is true.

1247
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:04,263
Beckett's not gonna change.

1248
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:05,834
The system's
not gonna change.

1249
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,493
- Y'all crazy.

1250
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,435
Dee got a custody hearing
in front of this man.

1251
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:12,702
- Would y'all please stop
talking about "Dee"

1252
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:15,903
Iike I'm not here?

1253
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:17,604
Just...
I don't know.

1254
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:30,352
- Dee?

1255
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:33,819
There's a lot riding on this,

1256
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:36,490
but it's your family,

1257
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:38,533
your life.

1258
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,365
This has
got to be your decision.

1259
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:42,802
I'm your lawyer.

1260
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:44,202
I'll do what you want.

1261
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:09,095
- Hello, Miss Roberts.

1262
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:13,596
- Hello, sir.

1263
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:17,272
- Cisco around?

1264
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:19,864
- He's in the kitchen.

1265
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:27,278
- Hey, Cisco,
how are you?

1266
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:30,409
- Nice to meet you.

1267
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:52,232
Hey, Dee.

1268
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,954
[door opens]

1269
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,806
- [stammers]

1270
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:42,386
[crying]

1271
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:10,984
[knocking on window]

1272
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:19,489
So they just up
and threw you out?

1273
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:23,122
- [coughs]

1274
01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:26,133
That's the law.

1275
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:28,829
Didn't think
it would happen,

1276
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:31,133
but it did.

1277
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,174
- Gladys,
you can stay with me.

1278
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:35,904
I got a little bedroom.

1279
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:37,877
- Thank you.

1280
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,540
It wouldn't work anyhow.

1281
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:43,278
They'd just throw you out too
if they catch you.

1282
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:53,584
[crying]

1283
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:55,891
- Gladys.

1284
01:03:55,998 --> 01:04:00,867
- [crying]

1285
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:04,462
- Our case has been assigned
to Judge C.W. Belmont.

1286
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:07,270
He's as strict law and order
as they come.

1287
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:09,401
Hasn't ruled against the police
in over 1 5 years.

1288
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,412
- How many times has Beckett
appeared before him?

1289
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,982
- At least a dozen times
in the last five years alone.

1290
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:15,380
- Then he's conflicted.

1291
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:16,883
We move
for a change of venue.

1292
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:18,817
- That's never gonna happen.

1293
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:20,252
No.

1294
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:21,687
Beckett knows the system.

1295
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:24,521
Belmont getting this case
is no accident.

1296
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:31,863
We gonna have to win this thing
before it ever goes to trial.

1297
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:39,367
- Uh.

1298
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:43,741
They came
in the middle of the night,

1299
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:45,245
two of them.

1300
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:49,079
crack!

1301
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:52,245
One of them
put a gun to my head,

1302
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:54,050
told me I was
a worthless piece of shit

1303
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:57,250
and scum like me
deserved to die.

1304
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:02,388
I just laid there
and took it.

1305
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:04,932
The next day, they took me over
to Mr. Beckett's office,

1306
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:08,197
and I was real ready
to cooperate.

1307
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,463
- Mr. Porter,
what happened

1308
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:14,407
after you were taken
to Mr. Beckett's office?

1309
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:15,738
- He told me about,

1310
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:21,750
that I know
I could get 60 years and...

1311
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:26,288
he was real tired
of seeing me.

1312
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:30,086
So he was gonna watch for my
no-good drug-head ass family.

1313
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:34,856
- So he threatened you
and your family with jail terms?

1314
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:36,454
- Yes.

1315
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:38,829
- Did he threaten you
with bodily harm?

1316
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:43,338
- He told me
he'd make a phone call

1317
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:47,603
and get the biggest-dicked
son of a bitch he could find--

1318
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:50,508
excuse my language, y'all,
but these his exact words:

1319
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:53,741
"I'm gonna get you locked up,

1320
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:55,146
"and I'm gonna
make a phone call

1321
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:57,185
"and get the biggest-dicked
son of a bitch I can find

1322
01:05:57,286 --> 01:06:00,084
to screw you every day for the
rest of your natural born life."

1323
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:01,486
- Those were his exact words?

1324
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:03,285
- That was his words to me,
yes.

1325
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:06,452
- Are you uncomfortable,
Mr. Porter?

1326
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:10,227
- Well, I said
I didn't want him here.

1327
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:11,322
- Who are you
referring to?

1328
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:14,631
- Him.

1329
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:15,863
- Let the record show

1330
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:19,169
that Mr. Porter has pointed
at Calvin Beckett.

1331
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:20,936
- I'm always
gonna be here, Eddie.

1332
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:22,635
That's my rag.

1333
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:24,303
I ain't going anywhere.

1334
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:32,214
- I was given
a list of names.

1335
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:33,310
- By Beckett?

1336
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:34,753
- Yeah.

1337
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:35,983
He had them
right there.

1338
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:38,492
- Mr. Porter, was Dee Roberts'
name on the list

1339
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:41,028
the DA gave you?

1340
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,394
- Uh, I don't remember.

1341
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:44,727
- Oh, come on, Mr. Porter.

1342
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:48,463
Did you put Dee Roberts'
name down as a drug dealer

1343
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:52,200
because your cousin Claudia
asked you to?

1344
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:53,536
- l-l-I can't remember.

1345
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:55,405
- But you do know
who Claudia is, right?

1346
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:56,535
You...

1347
01:06:56,645 --> 01:06:58,636
She's--
she lives with Darrell Hughes.

1348
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:00,215
- I know her.
She my cousin, yeah.

1349
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:01,806
- Boy, did you put
Dee Roberts' name down

1350
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:03,680
because your cousin Claudia
asked you to or not?

1351
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:04,878
- I don't know.

1352
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:06,545
Look, all they needed
was five more names,

1353
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:08,520
and they didn't care
who they was.

1354
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:14,592
- Mr. Porter,
my name is Mark Shelby.

1355
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:19,396
Mr. Porter, generally, would you
say that you tell the truth?

1356
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:21,629
- I try to,

1357
01:07:21,737 --> 01:07:23,898
unless I feel
like I'm in danger

1358
01:07:24,006 --> 01:07:26,338
or I got to protect myself.

1359
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:27,966
- Mm-hmm.

1360
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:29,305
And were you telling the truth

1361
01:07:29,412 --> 01:07:32,006
when you testified under oath
at the Green trial?

1362
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:34,139
'Cause the truth
you're telling today

1363
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:37,242
is not exactly the same truth
you were telling back then.

1364
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:39,981
- So I'm just trying to figure
out what about today's truth

1365
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:42,023
is true.

1366
01:07:42,124 --> 01:07:44,922
- Well,
he had me locked up then.

1367
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:48,121
He could've did anything
he wanted to do to me.

1368
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,460
And now I got to do
what's right,

1369
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:51,863
'cause the truth
will set you free.

1370
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:53,332
- Which truth
we talking about,

1371
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:55,631
the truth you told before
or the truth you're telling now?

1372
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:58,468
'Cause I'm
a little confused by all that.

1373
01:07:58,574 --> 01:07:59,802
Mr. Porter,

1374
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,570
you ever had
any mental problems?

1375
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:05,508
- Yeah.

1376
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:08,515
- Could you tell me
what type?

1377
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:12,451
- I was diagnosed
with paranoid schizophrenia,

1378
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:14,785
and I can't remember
the other one.

1379
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:16,824
- That's all right,
Mr. Porter.

1380
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,451
That's probably enough.

1381
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:22,326
Now, you understand that we're
embroiled in a lawsuit here.

1382
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:26,800
And these plaintiffs
are seeking damages.

1383
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:28,665
And if these
allegations are proven,

1384
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:31,831
a lot of police officers,
some good men,

1385
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,636
not being
police officers anymore.

1386
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:37,769
- Is there going to be an end
to this cascade of rhetoric?

1387
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:42,476
- I'm just trying to determine
if Mr. Porter here

1388
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:44,450
truly comprehends
the seriousness

1389
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:45,645
of these allegations,

1390
01:08:45,754 --> 01:08:47,449
allegations
that were brought forth

1391
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:50,354
by a paranoid schizophrenic

1392
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:52,290
that can't remember
what else he is.

1393
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:57,093
- I understand the seriousness
of this whole situation.

1394
01:08:57,199 --> 01:09:01,533
I understand the seriousness
of people being incarcerated.

1395
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,662
I understand the seriousness
of people's lives

1396
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:08,209
being changed forever
and affected.

1397
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:09,368
I understand the seriousness

1398
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:13,278
of not being able
to sleep good at night

1399
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:16,943
'cause you worried about
somebody coming to your house

1400
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:22,581
and harming you
or your family members.

1401
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:24,591
I understand a lot.

1402
01:09:27,429 --> 01:09:29,488
And I know my life
will never be the same.

1403
01:09:47,983 --> 01:09:50,178
- They'll destroy
Porter on the stand.

1404
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:53,119
- Well, we need to turn his
unreliability back against them.

1405
01:09:53,222 --> 01:09:57,352
- We need a change in venue.

1406
01:09:57,459 --> 01:09:59,893
- The motion is denied.

1407
01:09:59,995 --> 01:10:01,223
- But the district attorney

1408
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:03,491
has appeared
before you 1 6 times.

1409
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:06,932
Surely a change in venue would
result in a fairer trial.

1410
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:10,733
- The motion
has been denied.

1411
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:12,431
Is there something
about the word "denied"

1412
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:14,975
that you don't understand,
Counselor?

1413
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:16,408
- No, Your Honor.

1414
01:10:16,512 --> 01:10:17,672
- Good.

1415
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:26,014
- Did you hold a gun
to Eddie Porter's head

1416
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:27,713
and threaten
to kill him

1417
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:29,381
if he didn't help you
with your drug cases?

1418
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:32,790
- No.

1419
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:35,227
- Did you
give him crack cocaine...

1420
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:36,355
- No.

1421
01:10:36,465 --> 01:10:37,796
- So he could make
drug buys for you?

1422
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:38,958
- Absolutely not.

1423
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:40,433
- Did you suspect
he was using drugs?

1424
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:41,969
- No.

1425
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:43,800
- Did you test him?

1426
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:47,103
- No.

1427
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:48,870
- You think Eddie Porter
is mentally stable?

1428
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:49,967
- Objection.

1429
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:53,571
My client's
not a psychiatrist.

1430
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:55,650
- You go ahead
and answer the question.

1431
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:00,886
- I still can't believe
you're doing this.

1432
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:03,151
- Well, here I am.

1433
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,557
Now please
answer the question.

1434
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:11,322
- Look,
I can answer any question

1435
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:13,128
y'all want to throw at me, okay?

1436
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:14,725
Just 'cause
I didn't go to law school

1437
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:15,929
doesn't mean shit.

1438
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:20,236
Eddie Porter is crazier
than a $3 bill, okay?

1439
01:11:20,342 --> 01:11:22,105
He wouldn't know
which way the sky was

1440
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:24,111
unless I pointed him
up to it.

1441
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:25,475
The shit that boy did--

1442
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:27,742
I mean, I had to walk him
through every single step

1443
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:29,477
every time.

1444
01:11:31,854 --> 01:11:35,654
- Then why'd you trust him
as a confidential informant?

1445
01:11:35,758 --> 01:11:38,226
- Mr. Arnold,
you were a combined

1446
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:41,694
county drug task force commander
in November of 2000,

1447
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:43,094
were you not?

1448
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:44,688
- Yes.

1449
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,325
- Was the drug task force
racist in its design?

1450
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:49,267
- Absolutely not.

1451
01:11:53,242 --> 01:11:55,642
- I'd like to enter this
as exhibit 5.

1452
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:57,268
It comes
from your files.

1453
01:11:57,379 --> 01:12:02,043
And it's dated a month before
the raid at Arlington Springs.

1454
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:06,281
Are those the folks
whom you arrested that day?

1455
01:12:06,388 --> 01:12:07,377
- Most of them.

1456
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:09,116
- Do you know them?

1457
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:12,160
- Most of them.

1458
01:12:15,798 --> 01:12:17,766
- Could you tell us
each person's race?

1459
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:26,664
- Black--

1460
01:12:26,775 --> 01:12:29,710
African American.

1461
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:32,212
Black,
don't know,

1462
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:34,908
black, black,
black, black.

1463
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:37,042
I believe black.

1464
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:39,643
Black, don't know,

1465
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:41,484
gonna assume black,

1466
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:42,579
black, black,

1467
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:44,181
assume black again,

1468
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:47,524
black, black,
black, black,

1469
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:50,723
black, black, black,
don't know,

1470
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:52,391
black.

1471
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:04,774
- Mr. Lloyd,
I warned you last time.

1472
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,040
- What?

1473
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:08,673
He ain't fit
to take the kids.

1474
01:13:08,784 --> 01:13:10,513
All right, the first chance
he has to go to a bar,

1475
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:12,086
he'll leave
their ass hungry.

1476
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:14,451
- True, but I'm not gonna leave
the children with you either.

1477
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:15,955
They're gonna have to go
to a group home.

1478
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:17,047
- Look, I got a house.

1479
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:18,148
They belong
with their mama.

1480
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:19,249
- Miss Lloyd?
- What?

1481
01:13:19,361 --> 01:13:20,350
- This is not a debate society.

1482
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:21,451
You're done here.

1483
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:22,928
- Those are my kids.

1484
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:24,328
They belong
with their mama.

1485
01:13:24,433 --> 01:13:26,196
- Thank you very much.

1486
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:29,528
- Next case.
- Here you are, sir.

1487
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:33,734
- Hughes versus Roberts.

1488
01:13:35,677 --> 01:13:36,974
- Dee.

1489
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:43,517
- She's violent.

1490
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:44,608
She's abusive.

1491
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,654
Just last month,

1492
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:48,916
she was arrested
for a criminal attack.

1493
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:50,719
- The attack
was on his truck

1494
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:52,418
because he kidnapped my girls.

1495
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:55,053
- Well, they my children too.

1496
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:57,155
- I've never
abandoned my daughters.

1497
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,666
I was in jail, and I left them
with their grandmother,

1498
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:01,736
my mother,
who's an excellent caregiver.

1499
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:04,237
- Well, Miss Roberts,
you do seem to have

1500
01:14:04,339 --> 01:14:07,740
a rich and varied
relationship with the law.

1501
01:14:07,843 --> 01:14:09,868
Larceny, criminal attack,

1502
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:11,502
repeated disturbances
of the peace.

1503
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:13,638
- You mean where I'm screaming
'cause he's beating me?

1504
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:16,445
- An arrest for selling drugs
in a school zone.

1505
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:20,212
- Those charges
have been dropped.

1506
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:21,949
- Mm.

1507
01:14:22,057 --> 01:14:24,582
One can see
why Mr. Hughes is concerned.

1508
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:26,024
- If he is so concerned,

1509
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,221
maybe he should make some
of his child support payments.

1510
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:29,558
- I do pay child--

1511
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:31,394
it's called "child support"
not "Dee support."

1512
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:32,489
I pay for my children.

1513
01:14:32,601 --> 01:14:34,159
- Or stop seeing a woman

1514
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:35,964
who's been convicted
for child molesting.

1515
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:38,266
- All right, now,
you know that's not true.

1516
01:14:38,373 --> 01:14:41,103
Mr. Hughes, if I want
any more input from you,

1517
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:42,541
I will ask for it.

1518
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:48,610
You seem to have a point,
Miss Roberts.

1519
01:14:48,717 --> 01:14:52,050
Perhaps these girls shouldn't be
with Mr. Hughes either.

1520
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:56,748
Unfit parents are why the state
has homes for children,

1521
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:59,419
after all.

1522
01:14:59,528 --> 01:15:03,055
- I am not
an unfit mother.

1523
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:06,896
Now, if you want to hurt me
because I'm suing you,

1524
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:10,130
go ahead and do it.

1525
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:13,606
But so help me God,
if you hurt my children...

1526
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:25,245
I'm not an unfit mother.

1527
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:31,351
- [sighs]

1528
01:15:34,296 --> 01:15:38,460
- I have a report here
from CPS lnspector Moss.

1529
01:15:38,567 --> 01:15:41,161
Hm.

1530
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:45,001
Based on that, I am leaving
the children with you for now.

1531
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:46,802
But, Miss Roberts,

1532
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:52,541
do not assume that I will be
so lenient next time.

1533
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:54,343
Next case.

1534
01:16:13,535 --> 01:16:15,799
- Do you think
it will help?

1535
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:16,893
- Help?

1536
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:18,563
- The lawsuit.

1537
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:20,471
Will it really help?

1538
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,373
- Will it--
Dee?

1539
01:16:22,477 --> 01:16:24,672
An African-American man
has a better chance

1540
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:28,238
of being charged for a crime
than graduating college.

1541
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:35,916
The system
is so fundamentally broken...

1542
01:16:36,024 --> 01:16:39,460
Oh, God,
I don't know.

1543
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:41,188
Yes.

1544
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:44,129
I think it'll help.

1545
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:45,597
I hope it'll help.

1546
01:16:49,137 --> 01:16:51,605
Are you ready for tomorrow?

1547
01:16:51,707 --> 01:16:55,370
- I'll be fine.

1548
01:16:55,477 --> 01:16:57,308
Thank you.

1549
01:16:57,412 --> 01:16:58,401
- I should be thanking you.

1550
01:16:58,513 --> 01:17:00,037
I don't...

1551
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:04,244
I don't know how you have
the strength to keep going.

1552
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:05,615
- I had help.

1553
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:12,754
- All right.

1554
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:14,192
Shall we?

1555
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:19,267
- Miss Roberts,
do you have a job?

1556
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:20,426
- No.

1557
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:23,265
- Are you currently
seeking employment?

1558
01:17:23,372 --> 01:17:24,498
- Yes.

1559
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:27,598
But it's hard
because of the drug thing.

1560
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:30,576
- So you have
no source of income?

1561
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:33,537
- But my mama's
helping me out.

1562
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:37,085
- Sounds to me like
you could use some money.

1563
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:39,176
I bet a big, old, fat settlement
check from my clients

1564
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:40,379
would come in handy,
wouldn't it?

1565
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:41,478
What do you think, Gus?

1566
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:42,579
- Objection.

1567
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:43,680
Is that a question?

1568
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:44,918
- [chuckles]

1569
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:46,961
I knew that was coming.

1570
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:49,792
Speaking of that drug thing,

1571
01:17:49,898 --> 01:17:52,298
you'd been arrested before,
hadn't you,

1572
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:54,562
and since.

1573
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:55,830
- Yes.

1574
01:17:55,937 --> 01:17:59,236
- Now, it seems to me that
the more you do something,

1575
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:02,208
the more used to it
you get,

1576
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:04,107
the less stressful
it should become.

1577
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:06,043
- Oh, come on, Mark.
What are you do--

1578
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:07,615
are you asking a question,

1579
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:09,809
or is this a monologue?

1580
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:11,749
- Just an observation, Sam.

1581
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:14,014
Tell me about
your first arrest.

1582
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:15,817
- It was for theft.

1583
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:16,982
It was a very long time ago.

1584
01:18:17,092 --> 01:18:19,060
- You were guilty?

1585
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:21,925
- Well, yes, but--
- You were guilty.

1586
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:23,258
So your second arrest,

1587
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:26,095
that was for selling drugs
in a school zone.

1588
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:27,395
We know all about that,
don't we?

1589
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:28,696
- Those charges
were dropped.

1590
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:31,238
- What about
this most recent arrest?

1591
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:34,035
Tell me about that.

1592
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:36,633
- It was for criminal mischief.

1593
01:18:36,745 --> 01:18:39,179
I busted up Darrell's truck

1594
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:41,272
so he would give me
my girls back.

1595
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,078
- You were guilty
of that one too?

1596
01:18:43,185 --> 01:18:44,311
- Those charges
were dropped.

1597
01:18:44,419 --> 01:18:46,216
- But you were guilty.
- Objection.

1598
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:48,585
Mr. Shelby,
this is not a court of law,

1599
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:50,351
and you're not a judge.

1600
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:52,324
- Uh, who's this guy Darrell?

1601
01:18:52,427 --> 01:18:53,724
- Darrell Hughes,
he's the father

1602
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:55,194
of my two youngest kids.

1603
01:18:55,297 --> 01:18:56,889
- But I thought
you had four children.

1604
01:18:56,998 --> 01:18:59,728
- I do have four children.

1605
01:18:59,835 --> 01:19:01,530
- The oldest two
have different fathers.

1606
01:19:01,636 --> 01:19:03,194
- Fathers,
like plural?

1607
01:19:04,639 --> 01:19:06,698
- [laughs]
Damn, woman.

1608
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:08,400
How many different men
have you had sex with

1609
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:09,568
in the past eight years, huh?

1610
01:19:09,678 --> 01:19:10,667
- Objection!

1611
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:18,246
- You okay?

1612
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:20,253
- Uh-huh.

1613
01:19:20,355 --> 01:19:22,152
Seen better days.

1614
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:25,158
- Well, you're doing good.

1615
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:28,855
Remember, they're just as afraid
of you as you are of them.

1616
01:19:28,964 --> 01:19:31,159
- [sighs]

1617
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:40,973
- All right, let's get back
to these multiple fathers

1618
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:42,543
we were talking about
before the break.

1619
01:19:42,644 --> 01:19:44,236
Now, we know about
Darrell Hughes,

1620
01:19:44,346 --> 01:19:47,543
but what can you tell me
about the other two?

1621
01:19:47,649 --> 01:19:49,913
Where do they
currently reside?

1622
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:51,042
- They in prison.

1623
01:19:51,153 --> 01:19:52,484
- Both of them?

1624
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:55,956
- Mm-hmm.

1625
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:58,821
- Why?
What were they convicted of?

1626
01:19:58,927 --> 01:20:01,896
- You know,
I believe drugs.

1627
01:20:01,997 --> 01:20:03,225
- Drugs.

1628
01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:04,423
What kind of drugs?

1629
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:06,556
- Cocaine.

1630
01:20:06,668 --> 01:20:08,192
- Cocaine.
Crack cocaine?

1631
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:12,168
Would you mind
repeating that for the record?

1632
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:15,708
- Crack cocaine.

1633
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:18,302
- That's the same drug that you
were arrested for dealing,

1634
01:20:18,413 --> 01:20:20,176
was it not?

1635
01:20:20,282 --> 01:20:21,271
- Well, I didn't do that.

1636
01:20:21,383 --> 01:20:23,442
- Yeah, so you say.
- Objection!

1637
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:27,181
Miss Roberts
is not on trial here.

1638
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:28,551
- Well, Counselor,
forgive me,

1639
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:30,852
but I'm just having a tough time
trying to understand

1640
01:20:30,959 --> 01:20:34,122
why it is that this arrest
has caused Miss Roberts

1641
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:36,823
so much mental duress.

1642
01:20:36,932 --> 01:20:39,400
I mean, it seems to me
like she and her whole family

1643
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:42,436
have been in
and out of jails and prisons

1644
01:20:42,537 --> 01:20:46,667
and police stations
her whole life long.

1645
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:48,743
So what is it
about this particular arrest

1646
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:50,368
that is so different?

1647
01:20:50,478 --> 01:20:51,809
- Mr. Shelby--

1648
01:20:51,913 --> 01:20:53,847
- I'll tell you what
made this arrest so different.

1649
01:20:53,949 --> 01:20:55,644
I've only spent
one night in jail before this.

1650
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:57,012
I was 1 6 years old,

1651
01:20:57,118 --> 01:21:00,110
was arrested for stealing
diapers and milk for my babies.

1652
01:21:00,222 --> 01:21:02,486
I did it.
They kept me for one night.

1653
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:04,058
I knew
I was getting right out.

1654
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:08,027
To be locked up
for 21 days

1655
01:21:08,129 --> 01:21:09,653
away from my girls

1656
01:21:09,764 --> 01:21:13,029
not knowing if I was gonna
get out to see them again,

1657
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:16,626
21 days in a cage...

1658
01:21:16,738 --> 01:21:18,467
I may not
have all your schooling,

1659
01:21:18,573 --> 01:21:20,734
but it seems
pretty different to me.

1660
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:29,280
- Judge Belmont
has decided

1661
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:33,081
that Beckett only has to answer
our questions for three hours.

1662
01:21:33,188 --> 01:21:37,090
Any more time would be
wasting the DA's time.

1663
01:21:37,192 --> 01:21:40,286
- We knew he was gonna
give him a lot of room.

1664
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:43,592
- Dee, it is atrocious after
what they've put you through.

1665
01:21:49,204 --> 01:21:50,728
- Mr. Hill,

1666
01:21:50,839 --> 01:21:55,071
if you were Beckett's lawyer,
what would you do?

1667
01:21:55,176 --> 01:21:57,542
- Uh...

1668
01:21:57,646 --> 01:22:01,639
I'd destroy Porter's credibility
right from the start.

1669
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:02,739
I mean, he's nuts.

1670
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:04,580
Nothing he says
can be believed,

1671
01:22:04,686 --> 01:22:06,517
and he's our
only source of information

1672
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:09,283
as to what really went on.

1673
01:22:09,391 --> 01:22:11,723
I'd argue that having the police
rely on him as an informant

1674
01:22:11,826 --> 01:22:14,351
was a mistake
but an honest one.

1675
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:16,487
- All right,
what about the numbers?

1676
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:18,327
All white cops,
all black targets.

1677
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:19,764
- Coincidence.

1678
01:22:19,868 --> 01:22:22,769
It's a result of the drug
they chose to go after,

1679
01:22:22,871 --> 01:22:24,566
crack cocaine.

1680
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:27,540
Feds target it.
Why can't the task force?

1681
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:32,376
And, Dee,
I'd go after you.

1682
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:35,779
I mean,
really work on you,

1683
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:38,444
suggest that you're
just a desperate crack mother

1684
01:22:38,553 --> 01:22:41,784
trying to score
a monetary judgment

1685
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:43,084
by playing the race card

1686
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:46,718
against a hardworking group
of public servants.

1687
01:22:46,828 --> 01:22:48,557
The police
made some mistakes.

1688
01:22:48,663 --> 01:22:49,925
They have a tough job.

1689
01:22:50,031 --> 01:22:51,498
Occasionally,
they'll make mistakes.

1690
01:22:51,599 --> 01:22:53,328
They're only human.

1691
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:56,871
Should we really punish them
for trying to protect us?

1692
01:22:58,206 --> 01:23:01,004
- Well, there you have it.

1693
01:23:01,109 --> 01:23:03,304
It'll work too.

1694
01:23:03,411 --> 01:23:05,242
We'll never
get anywhere with Belmont

1695
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:07,781
by criticizing the cops.

1696
01:23:07,882 --> 01:23:11,716
We have to prove that Beckett
was motivated by racist intent.

1697
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:22,224
- How can you prove
racist intent?

1698
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:28,426
- You look
at a person's history.

1699
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:30,504
You interview his coworkers,
his family,

1700
01:23:30,605 --> 01:23:32,197
people who know him well.

1701
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:34,434
But we've tried everyone.

1702
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:37,136
No one is gonna
say anything about Beckett.

1703
01:23:41,316 --> 01:23:42,943
- There's Julie's car.

1704
01:23:45,887 --> 01:23:48,447
She's a regular
at the coffee shop.

1705
01:24:04,105 --> 01:24:05,538
Thank you, Julie.

1706
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:08,131
- It's about time
somebody said something.

1707
01:24:11,646 --> 01:24:14,308
- Just a second now.

1708
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:18,608
- Okay?

1709
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,244
- We're good.

1710
01:24:20,355 --> 01:24:25,224
- Are you ready,
Mrs. Beckett?

1711
01:24:25,326 --> 01:24:27,317
- Yes.

1712
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:28,521
- All right,

1713
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:30,291
now, this one's gonna be
a little bit harder.

1714
01:24:30,398 --> 01:24:32,491
- Used fractions...

1715
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:35,467
[pounding on door]

1716
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:37,663
- Come on, it's me!

1717
01:24:37,772 --> 01:24:38,761
Open up the door, Dee.

1718
01:24:38,873 --> 01:24:39,862
I know you in there.
Come on.

1719
01:24:39,974 --> 01:24:41,168
[pounding on door]

1720
01:24:41,276 --> 01:24:42,766
- Darrell, go home.

1721
01:24:42,877 --> 01:24:43,866
- Dee, open the door.

1722
01:24:43,978 --> 01:24:45,070
Come on.

1723
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:47,205
[pounding on door]

1724
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:49,215
- Stop knocking on my door,
come on.

1725
01:24:49,317 --> 01:24:51,478
Stay there, Sherice.

1726
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:52,575
- Hey.

1727
01:24:52,687 --> 01:24:55,178
- You drunk.

1728
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:57,258
- I came
to get the girls.

1729
01:24:57,358 --> 01:24:58,382
They need
their father too.

1730
01:24:58,493 --> 01:24:59,824
- Look, you heard
what the man said.

1731
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:01,122
They need
to be with their mother.

1732
01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:03,220
Mm-mm. Go home.
Good night.

1733
01:25:03,331 --> 01:25:05,424
- Come on now,
listen to me.

1734
01:25:05,533 --> 01:25:07,728
Look, think about it.
Hear me out.

1735
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:09,201
If we got back together,

1736
01:25:09,304 --> 01:25:12,671
then they could have us both.

1737
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:14,503
- Mm-mm.

1738
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:16,668
No, we been through this
already, Darrell.

1739
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:17,767
No.
- It won't be like that.

1740
01:25:17,879 --> 01:25:19,141
- Darrell, go home.

1741
01:25:19,247 --> 01:25:21,306
Darrell!
- Come on!

1742
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:22,644
Don't come into my--

1743
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:24,240
Go to your room, Sherice!

1744
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:26,183
Get to your room right now.

1745
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:28,380
- Give me
two seconds to talk!

1746
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:32,893
Give me my girls!

1747
01:25:32,994 --> 01:25:34,120
- 2-4--
- Go ahead, call 'em.

1748
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:36,663
I don't care.

1749
01:25:36,764 --> 01:25:38,254
Come on, man,
we're getting out of here.

1750
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:39,890
- Please come
as soon as you can.

1751
01:25:40,001 --> 01:25:41,093
It's an emergency.

1752
01:25:41,202 --> 01:25:42,430
Darrell, please!

1753
01:25:42,537 --> 01:25:43,868
- Let's go.
- Don't do this, Darrell.

1754
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:44,961
- Come on,
get out my way!

1755
01:25:45,073 --> 01:25:46,870
- I'm not--
- Get off me!

1756
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:48,670
- Stop it!
Get out my house!

1757
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:50,573
- Hey, have you lost
your Goddamned mind?

1758
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:52,043
- Mama!
- Put that baby down!

1759
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:53,205
- What you gonna
do with that?

1760
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:54,303
- I will knock you out.

1761
01:25:54,415 --> 01:25:55,746
- Well, hell,
old lady, swing!

1762
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:56,839
- Come on,
step into it.

1763
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:57,940
- What you gonna
do with that, huh?

1764
01:25:58,052 --> 01:25:59,041
- I'm gonna
knock your head off!

1765
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:00,246
- Go ahead, go ahead!

1766
01:26:00,355 --> 01:26:01,686
- Your girls
are looking at you, Darrell.

1767
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:03,723
- I wish you would.
- Go ahead, swing!

1768
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:05,122
- I'll knock you out,
Darrell!

1769
01:26:05,226 --> 01:26:06,352
- Get off me!

1770
01:26:06,461 --> 01:26:08,520
- You know Beckett
ain't gonna charge me!

1771
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:11,121
You know Beckett
ain't gonna charge me!

1772
01:26:11,232 --> 01:26:14,258
You know Beckett
ain't gonna charge me, Dee.

1773
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:15,393
I'll be back!

1774
01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:16,492
- Come on.

1775
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:32,847
- I know.

1776
01:26:32,954 --> 01:26:35,218
I know, sweetie.

1777
01:26:35,323 --> 01:26:39,020
I'm here with you.

1778
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:40,822
I'm here with you.

1779
01:26:49,103 --> 01:26:50,593
- Hey.

1780
01:26:55,443 --> 01:26:57,138
- I'm here with you.

1781
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:04,112
- Come on, Dee.

1782
01:27:08,122 --> 01:27:11,649
All right,
here we go.

1783
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:14,387
- So sorry I'm late.

1784
01:27:14,495 --> 01:27:15,621
Had a rough night.

1785
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:18,460
- It's all right.
Sam's already there.

1786
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:20,193
- You okay, Dee?

1787
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:22,667
- I'm fine.

1788
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:24,795
David,

1789
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:26,703
I have an idea.

1790
01:27:26,808 --> 01:27:28,605
[engine turns]

1791
01:27:32,647 --> 01:27:34,842
- Three hours, Sam.

1792
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:36,940
The judge said
you get three hours with me.

1793
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:38,518
Nine minutes is over.

1794
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:40,087
- [mumbles]

1795
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:45,184
- Sam, there's no need
to be uncivil, is there?

1796
01:27:45,293 --> 01:27:47,386
After all,
we used to be friends.

1797
01:27:47,495 --> 01:27:51,898
We still have to be together
for 2 hours and 50 minutes.

1798
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:56,459
- Sorry we're late.

1799
01:28:03,077 --> 01:28:07,207
Mr. Beckett, you're aware
that the videotape we're taping

1800
01:28:07,315 --> 01:28:08,839
will become part
of the public record?

1801
01:28:14,155 --> 01:28:16,089
I'm gonna
take your silence as assent.

1802
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:19,125
Before we begin,
Mr. Beckett,

1803
01:28:19,227 --> 01:28:21,286
I'd like
to introduce my associate,

1804
01:28:21,396 --> 01:28:24,160
Mr. Byron Hill.

1805
01:28:24,265 --> 01:28:29,862
Mr. Hill will be
conducting your deposition.

1806
01:28:38,746 --> 01:28:40,407
- Good morning.

1807
01:28:40,515 --> 01:28:44,212
Mr. Beckett,
is it your regular practice

1808
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:47,015
to indict someone based on
the word of a single informant?

1809
01:28:47,121 --> 01:28:49,521
- Regular practice
all across Texas.

1810
01:28:49,624 --> 01:28:51,854
- And is it also your practice
to give the informant

1811
01:28:51,959 --> 01:28:53,859
a list of people
you want to find guilty?

1812
01:28:53,961 --> 01:28:55,292
- Objection.

1813
01:28:55,396 --> 01:28:57,330
Question assumes my client
gave such a list.

1814
01:28:57,432 --> 01:28:59,696
- Mr. Beckett, do you frequently
use informants

1815
01:28:59,801 --> 01:29:03,168
with a history of...

1816
01:29:03,271 --> 01:29:04,431
mental instability?

1817
01:29:04,539 --> 01:29:08,339
- We use informants
that know the drug dealers.

1818
01:29:08,443 --> 01:29:10,775
This list rarely
includes Baptist preachers,

1819
01:29:10,878 --> 01:29:12,140
Jewish rabbis,

1820
01:29:12,246 --> 01:29:14,874
or wise-ass lawyers.

1821
01:29:21,656 --> 01:29:24,022
- Please mark this
as exhibit 5.

1822
01:29:30,164 --> 01:29:32,291
- Mr. Beckett, these are
your drug arrest records

1823
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,027
for the past five years.

1824
01:29:34,135 --> 01:29:37,593
Now, Harmony County
is less than half black.

1825
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:41,141
Why do you think over 85%
of the task force arrests

1826
01:29:41,242 --> 01:29:42,800
are of black people?

1827
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:44,901
- Must be that it's them
doing all the drugs.

1828
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:50,612
40 minutes left, boy.

1829
01:29:56,924 --> 01:29:59,256
- Mr. Beckett,

1830
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:03,558
even black people
can tell time.

1831
01:30:03,664 --> 01:30:06,030
Calvin...

1832
01:30:06,134 --> 01:30:09,763
You don't mind
if I call you that, do you?

1833
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:11,896
You seem to have a problem
with us black people.

1834
01:30:12,006 --> 01:30:13,098
- Objection.

1835
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:14,674
- To what?
That wasn't even a question.

1836
01:30:14,776 --> 01:30:16,676
- You ever call
blacks "niggers"?

1837
01:30:20,815 --> 01:30:21,839
Answer the question.

1838
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:25,947
Answer the question.

1839
01:30:28,156 --> 01:30:30,386
Mr. Beckett,
you are under oath,

1840
01:30:30,491 --> 01:30:32,686
and you have
an obligation to respond.

1841
01:30:32,794 --> 01:30:33,886
- I don't remember.

1842
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:37,394
- You never said it?

1843
01:30:37,498 --> 01:30:39,466
- I don't remember
ever saying it.

1844
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:45,766
- What's your relationship like
with your ex-wife?

1845
01:30:45,873 --> 01:30:47,568
- Don't have
any kind of relationship.

1846
01:30:47,675 --> 01:30:49,973
What the hell
kind of a question is that?

1847
01:30:50,077 --> 01:30:52,204
- She seems to have a better
memory than you do, Calvin.

1848
01:30:55,716 --> 01:30:58,879
- My name
is Elizabeth Beckett.

1849
01:30:58,986 --> 01:31:02,615
And I'm competent
to testify therein.

1850
01:31:02,723 --> 01:31:08,593
- How'd your ex-husband feel
about black people?

1851
01:31:08,696 --> 01:31:09,993
- Oh, he hated them.

1852
01:31:10,097 --> 01:31:12,497
Calvin hated them.

1853
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:13,658
He even hated the children.

1854
01:31:13,768 --> 01:31:15,201
If they came in our yard,

1855
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:17,635
he'd go out there
and scream at them.

1856
01:31:17,738 --> 01:31:22,198
- You think his views
affect his behavior as a DA?

1857
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:25,143
- He thought
that people wanted convictions.

1858
01:31:25,246 --> 01:31:29,649
He thought that
the feds wanted convictions.

1859
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:33,208
Calvin would say that,

1860
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:39,123
"Who better to convict
than the lazy-ass niggers? "

1861
01:31:42,763 --> 01:31:46,597
- He referred
to black people as "niggers"?

1862
01:31:46,701 --> 01:31:49,932
- Yes.

1863
01:31:50,037 --> 01:31:51,800
Yes, he did.

1864
01:31:51,906 --> 01:31:53,100
Yes.

1865
01:31:53,207 --> 01:31:57,940
- Now, uh,
you remember her, right?

1866
01:31:58,045 --> 01:31:59,103
Ex-wife?

1867
01:31:59,213 --> 01:32:01,943
That's your ex-wife.

1868
01:32:02,049 --> 01:32:03,710
You want to see
what your daughter has to say,

1869
01:32:03,818 --> 01:32:06,548
or has your memory returned?

1870
01:32:06,654 --> 01:32:08,986
Let's see what
your daughter has to say.

1871
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:10,318
- My name is Julie Beckett.

1872
01:32:10,424 --> 01:32:14,451
I'm 22, and I'm competent
to testify herein.

1873
01:32:14,562 --> 01:32:16,962
- Right, okay, Julie,

1874
01:32:17,064 --> 01:32:21,330
did your father ever express any
hostility toward black people?

1875
01:32:21,435 --> 01:32:24,063
- Oh, yeah, never even
tried to hide it, you know?

1876
01:32:24,171 --> 01:32:25,468
Him and Jerry Arnold,

1877
01:32:25,573 --> 01:32:28,269
they would, like, sit around
and drink beers and shit.

1878
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:30,241
And they would always say,

1879
01:32:30,344 --> 01:32:31,811
"The only way
to save our town

1880
01:32:31,913 --> 01:32:34,541
is to blow
Arlington Springs up."

1881
01:32:34,649 --> 01:32:36,116
They would say shit like,

1882
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:40,119
"Make
the nigger cockroaches burn,"

1883
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:41,552
shit like that,
you know?

1884
01:32:41,656 --> 01:32:44,181
- So how'd he feel
when he found out

1885
01:32:44,292 --> 01:32:46,351
that you were
dating a black man?

1886
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:49,759
- Oh, he was--
he was so angry,

1887
01:32:49,864 --> 01:32:51,855
Iike, crazy angry.

1888
01:32:51,966 --> 01:32:54,332
He started chasing me down,
okay?

1889
01:32:54,435 --> 01:32:55,459
He chased me down,

1890
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:58,403
and he started whipping me
with his belt.

1891
01:32:58,506 --> 01:33:00,235
I mean, he was
just going crazy, you know,

1892
01:33:00,341 --> 01:33:01,638
Iike,
saying shit to me like,

1893
01:33:01,742 --> 01:33:04,905
"You're nothing but a dirty
nigger-loving whore,

1894
01:33:05,012 --> 01:33:07,503
dirty nigger-loving whore,
dirty nigger-loving whore."

1895
01:33:11,452 --> 01:33:12,441
- What the fuck are you doing

1896
01:33:12,553 --> 01:33:13,884
when they're
over here whipping me?

1897
01:33:13,988 --> 01:33:17,014
- Mr. Beckett, do you ever
call blacks "niggers"?

1898
01:33:17,124 --> 01:33:18,455
- Oh, of course
I call them niggers,

1899
01:33:18,559 --> 01:33:20,254
you uppity piece of shit.

1900
01:33:20,361 --> 01:33:22,488
Can't think
of any folks down here

1901
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:24,155
that don't
call you people niggers.

1902
01:33:25,666 --> 01:33:28,829
Yet race has nothing to do
with whom you prosecute as DA?

1903
01:33:58,699 --> 01:34:01,600
- Sam, Byron.

1904
01:34:01,702 --> 01:34:05,433
He practically
ordered them to settle.

1905
01:34:05,539 --> 01:34:07,166
There's no way
he wanted that tape

1906
01:34:07,274 --> 01:34:09,401
played in a Texas courtroom.

1907
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:11,171
It's over.

1908
01:34:11,278 --> 01:34:12,802
- [laughing]

1909
01:34:12,913 --> 01:34:14,175
Hey!

1910
01:34:14,281 --> 01:34:17,148
[laughing]

1911
01:34:17,251 --> 01:34:18,513
- Oh, my goodness.

1912
01:34:18,619 --> 01:34:20,086
- Oh, my gosh,
we did it.

1913
01:34:20,187 --> 01:34:21,848
[laughing]

1914
01:34:24,191 --> 01:34:25,215
- Well?

1915
01:34:25,326 --> 01:34:26,884
- Let's get out of here.

1916
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:29,826
- I want to go...

1917
01:34:32,933 --> 01:34:33,922
- Hm.

1918
01:34:34,035 --> 01:34:36,401
- Can you believe that?

1919
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:38,199
Isn't he yours, Dee?

1920
01:34:41,909 --> 01:34:45,538
- They've offered to disband
the drug task force

1921
01:34:45,646 --> 01:34:49,173
and to give each of the accused
a small settlement.

1922
01:34:49,283 --> 01:34:51,649
- What about Gladys?

1923
01:34:51,752 --> 01:34:52,776
- She's no longer a felon,

1924
01:34:52,887 --> 01:34:56,482
so she can move back
into Arlington Springs.

1925
01:34:56,590 --> 01:34:57,614
- And our arrest records?

1926
01:34:57,725 --> 01:34:58,714
- Expunged.

1927
01:35:01,128 --> 01:35:02,823
- And Beckett?

1928
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:05,831
- Dee, we did
everything we could.

1929
01:35:05,933 --> 01:35:07,560
Beckett
will have to face the voters.

1930
01:35:07,668 --> 01:35:09,795
But that's the best
we could do.

1931
01:35:09,904 --> 01:35:11,132
The judge was firm on that,

1932
01:35:11,238 --> 01:35:13,934
that Beckett's future
be decided by the voters.

1933
01:35:17,978 --> 01:35:19,240
- Will this stop the raids?

1934
01:35:19,346 --> 01:35:21,814
- I think so.

1935
01:35:21,916 --> 01:35:22,940
I really think so.

1936
01:35:50,678 --> 01:35:55,138
[radio chatter]

1937
01:35:56,951 --> 01:36:00,409
- Sam?

1938
01:36:00,521 --> 01:36:01,920
- Yeah.

1939
01:36:02,022 --> 01:36:03,114
- Is everything all right?

1940
01:36:04,792 --> 01:36:06,259
- Yeah, yeah.

1941
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:08,851
Everything's all right.

1942
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:24,034
- Now, in our congregation,

1943
01:36:24,145 --> 01:36:29,481
there is a woman
that has struggled

1944
01:36:29,583 --> 01:36:31,881
and suffered

1945
01:36:31,986 --> 01:36:33,977
and prevailed,

1946
01:36:34,088 --> 01:36:36,682
not just for herself

1947

I knew how it would feel #

1956
01:37:14,428 --> 01:37:17,454
# to be free #

1957
01:37:17,565 --> 01:37:20,557
# I wish I could break #

1958
01:37:20,668 --> 01:37:24,229
# all the chains
holding me #

1959
01:37:25,306 --> 01:37:28,571
# I wish I could say #

1960
01:37:28,676 --> 01:37:32,339
# all the things
that I should say #

1961
01:37:32,446 --> 01:37:34,414
# Say 'em loud #

1962
01:37:34,515 --> 01:37:36,312
# Say 'em clear #

1963
01:37:36,417 --> 01:37:40,979
# for the whole
round world to hear #

1964
01:37:41,088 --> 01:37:44,216
# I wish I could share #

1965
01:37:44,325 --> 01:37:48,819
# All the love
that's in my heart #

1966
01:37:48,929 --> 01:37:51,898
# Remove all the bars #

1967
01:37:51,999 --> 01:37:56,663
# that keep us apart #

1968
01:37:56,770 --> 01:37:59,830

# what it means
to be me #

1970
01:38:03,811 --> 01:38:07,406
# Then you'd see
and agree #

1971
01:38:07,514 --> 01:38:12,349
# that it ever man
should be free #

1972

I could fly #

1984

# Oh, I'd soar
to the sun #

1985
01:39:02,536 --> 01:39:06,529
# and look down
at the sea #

1986
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:10,701
# Then I'd sing
'cause I know, yeah #

1987

# not sing
'cause I'm known, yeah #
