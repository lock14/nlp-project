1
00:00:41,844 --> 00:00:43,402
Good night, Carrie.
Have a good weekend.

2
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:46,611
Oh, Mr. Burke.

3
00:00:48,484 --> 00:00:52,477
Your meeting on Monday with Mr. Harrington
has been pushed back to 1:15.

4
00:00:55,992 --> 00:00:57,152
Have a nice weekend.

5
00:03:06,522 --> 00:03:08,820
You are not where you belong.

6
00:03:28,611 --> 00:03:31,045
- The girl broke the lamp.
- Which lamp?

7
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,811
The antique lamp.

8
00:03:33,215 --> 00:03:34,546
- In my room?
- Yes.

9
00:03:36,652 --> 00:03:38,984
That lamp cost over $220.

10
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:41,447
Well, maybe we can get it fixed.

11
00:03:41,724 --> 00:03:45,057
We're never gonna get it fixed.
I think that's why she did it.

12
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:52,631
Yes. All right. I'm going.

13
00:03:54,303 --> 00:03:56,771
- Will you bring me cigarettes?
- I'm not coming back.

14
00:03:57,306 --> 00:03:59,433
- What?
- I'm not coming back.

15
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:02,445
- What do you mean?
- I'm not going to come back.

16
00:04:02,445 --> 00:04:04,174
- You're not ever coming back?
- No.

17
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:06,716
Why not?

18
00:04:06,716 --> 00:04:08,650
I don't want to
live this kind of life.

19
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:10,413
What does that mean?

20
00:04:10,786 --> 00:04:12,688
That I can't live this life.

21
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:14,223
- You can't live this life?
- Yes.

22
00:04:14,223 --> 00:04:16,418
- So you're leaving me?
- Yes.

23
00:04:30,306 --> 00:04:33,298
Then what about me?
Don't you love me anymore?

24
00:04:33,843 --> 00:04:35,140
- You don't?
- No.

25
00:04:36,746 --> 00:04:39,840
- And why is that?
- I don't know.

26
00:04:41,517 --> 00:04:44,850
- And when did you find this out?
- A long time ago.

27
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:46,355
- You did?
- Yes.

28
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:48,186
- How long ago?
- Years ago.

29
00:04:48,691 --> 00:04:50,989
You've known for years
that you don't love me?

30
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,464
Then why do you decide
you're leaving me now?

31
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,503
- I've had enough.
- Yes, but why now?

32
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,708
Because you don't interest me,
spiritually or sexually.

33
00:05:11,213 --> 00:05:13,883
Hadn't you known
this for some time?

34
00:05:13,883 --> 00:05:15,050
Why do you think?

35
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,245
- I think that you did.
- Yes, I did.

36
00:05:17,653 --> 00:05:22,317
Then why didn't you leave then,
you stupid shit?

37
00:05:22,892 --> 00:05:26,623
All of these years you say you've
been living here? You idiot!

38
00:05:27,396 --> 00:05:31,901
I've had enough! You idiot!
Passing judgment on me all this time!

39
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:34,301
- I never passed judgment...
- And then you tell me you're leaving!

40
00:05:36,172 --> 00:05:37,867
- Yes.
- Go, then.

41
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,175
I'll call ya.

42
00:05:39,175 --> 00:05:42,303
Please! And we'll talk. What should
we do with the house, cut it in half?

43
00:05:42,678 --> 00:05:44,447
Go, get out of here, go!

44
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:48,315
- You think I'm fooling.
- I do not. Goodbye. Thank you.

45
00:05:48,784 --> 00:05:51,116
Goodbye! Get out!

46
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,453
Get out of here! And don't you
ever come back, do you hear me?

47
00:06:44,006 --> 00:06:46,372
- I'll tell you who's got it easy.
- Who?

48
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,479
The niggers.
Sometimes I wish I was a nigger.

49
00:06:53,382 --> 00:06:55,077
Sometimes I wish I was too.

50
00:06:55,351 --> 00:06:58,377
I'd rob a store.
I don't blame 'em, I swear to God.

51
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:00,489
Because I want to tell ya...

52
00:07:00,489 --> 00:07:03,424
we're bred to do the
things that we do.

53
00:07:04,627 --> 00:07:09,326
Northern race, one thing...
southern race... somethin' else.

54
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,534
They want to do is sit under the tree
and watch the elephant.

55
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,934
And I don't blame them one small bit.

56
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:25,745
Because there's too much pressure on us.

57
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:31,020
And that's no joke, and that's
not poetry. It's just too much.

58
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,148
It is. It absolutely is.

59
00:07:34,757 --> 00:07:37,282
- A man has got to get out.
- What do you mean?

60
00:07:37,526 --> 00:07:40,086
A man has got to
get away from himself.

61
00:07:40,396 --> 00:07:41,420
That's true.

62
00:08:01,483 --> 00:08:04,884
Because the pressure is too much.

63
00:08:07,156 --> 00:08:09,556
- What do you do?
- What do you mean?

64
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:11,819
What do you do to get out?

65
00:08:12,795 --> 00:08:14,490
- What do I do?
- Yeah.

66
00:08:15,965 --> 00:08:19,560
What are the things to do?
What are the things anyone does?

67
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,933
Pussy? I don't know. Pussy.

68
00:08:25,007 --> 00:08:28,033
Power. Money. Adventure.

69
00:08:29,411 --> 00:08:30,537
I think that's it.

70
00:08:32,982 --> 00:08:37,180
Self-destruction.
I think that that's it.

71
00:08:39,922 --> 00:08:41,412
- Don't you?
- Yes.

72
00:08:43,926 --> 00:08:48,727
Religion.
Um, I suppose that's it.

73
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:52,231
Release. Gratification.

74
00:08:54,303 --> 00:08:59,002
You gotta get something that opens
your nose. Life is too short.

75
00:09:03,545 --> 00:09:05,570
My wife and I are incompatible.

76
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,840
I'm sorry to hear that. In what way?

77
00:09:09,585 --> 00:09:11,212
I don't find her attractive.

78
00:09:12,788 --> 00:09:14,221
And she hates my guts.

79
00:09:16,592 --> 00:09:19,561
It's a boring thing to talk about,
but that's what's on my mind.

80
00:09:20,295 --> 00:09:21,489
I understand.

81
00:09:22,131 --> 00:09:23,530
- You do?
- Yes.

82
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,322
Thank you.

83
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:27,666
Believe me, it's all right.

84
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:31,907
I know that we all need it,
we don't know where to find it...

85
00:09:31,907 --> 00:09:34,171
and I know what it means
and I understand.

86
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:38,414
I... feel...

87
00:09:38,414 --> 00:09:40,245
I know, like your balls
were cut off.

88
00:09:40,582 --> 00:09:42,516
Yes. A long long time ago.

89
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,978
And I don't feel like a man.

90
00:09:47,856 --> 00:09:49,414
- You know what you need?
- No.

91
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,224
- You need to get laid.
- I do. I know I do.

92
00:09:55,998 --> 00:09:58,660
And that's why the
niggers have it easy.

93
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:01,636
I'll tell you why.

94
00:10:01,837 --> 00:10:06,206
There are responsibilities
they never have accepted.

95
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,451
Try the Allegro.

96
00:10:20,022 --> 00:10:21,421
THE PRIEST

97
00:10:21,657 --> 00:10:22,817
What is that?

98
00:10:23,225 --> 00:10:24,852
It's a club on 47th Street.

99
00:10:27,096 --> 00:10:30,497
I want this to be on me.
I want you to remember...

100
00:10:32,468 --> 00:10:34,231
there was someone who listened.

101
00:10:36,071 --> 00:10:37,800
You'd do the same for me.

102
00:11:27,322 --> 00:11:28,550
Want to buy me a drink?

103
00:11:32,795 --> 00:11:33,489
Yes.

104
00:11:38,734 --> 00:11:40,235
I'm putting myself at your mercy.

105
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:42,471
This is my first
time in a place like this.

106
00:11:42,471 --> 00:11:45,929
I don't want to be taken
advantage of. You understand?

107
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:49,707
Buy me a drink, and
we'll go in the back.

108
00:11:50,345 --> 00:11:53,007
- And do what?
- Whatever you want.

109
00:11:58,987 --> 00:12:00,147
$50.

110
00:12:03,926 --> 00:12:05,359
Buy me a drink.

111
00:12:10,966 --> 00:12:14,026
- You... get a commission on the drinks?
- Yes.

112
00:12:14,336 --> 00:12:16,531
- How much commission do you get?
- 50%.

113
00:12:17,873 --> 00:12:19,101
That's $100.

114
00:12:20,642 --> 00:12:22,610
- It's too much.
- What?

115
00:12:23,345 --> 00:12:25,472
Too much. Thank you.

116
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:28,246
- 80.
- No, thank you.

117
00:12:28,483 --> 00:12:30,644
- 80.
- I'll give you 50.

118
00:12:30,886 --> 00:12:33,856
I'll give you the 50 you'd get
if I gave her 100 for the drink.

119
00:12:33,856 --> 00:12:35,824
But I'm not gonna give them 100.

120
00:12:36,258 --> 00:12:38,886
- But you have to buy me a drink.
- No, I'm sorry.

121
00:12:39,962 --> 00:12:42,954
- All right, give me 30.
- On top of the 50?

122
00:12:43,232 --> 00:12:45,564
- Yeah, you give me 80.
- To you?

123
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:46,631
Yes.

124
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:48,860
- I should give the 80 to you?
- Yes.

125
00:12:50,072 --> 00:12:53,337
- And then you give her the 50?
- Yes, I got to give her the 50.

126
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:54,676
No.

127
00:12:54,676 --> 00:12:55,711
For the drink.

128
00:12:55,711 --> 00:12:58,547
No, you don't have to pay
her for the drink... tea.

129
00:12:58,547 --> 00:13:00,412
- It's not tea.
- It's not tea?

130
00:13:01,183 --> 00:13:03,447
If it's not tea, what is it then?

131
00:13:05,721 --> 00:13:09,452
I came in here to be straight!
Why do we go through this?

132
00:13:10,192 --> 00:13:13,059
Get in or get out.
Don't mill around.

133
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,197
Get in or get out.

134
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:08,940
Seven. Go in seven.

135
00:15:10,712 --> 00:15:14,614
Oh, no. Six... I mean, six.
Go in six.

136
00:16:02,064 --> 00:16:03,190
Take your dick out.

137
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,026
Take your dick out.

138
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:09,693
Come on.
Take your dick out.

139
00:16:10,372 --> 00:16:12,567
- I'm not a cop.
- I know you're not a cop.

140
00:16:12,941 --> 00:16:16,001
Take your dick out.
I'm gonna give you a good time.

141
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:21,709
How do we get this barrier
to come down?

142
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,385
It doesn't come down.

143
00:16:23,385 --> 00:16:25,012
Then how are you
gonna give me a good time?

144
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:26,853
Come here.

145
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,585
Give me 10 bucks.
Give me 10 bucks.

146
00:16:35,063 --> 00:16:35,927
Put it through the thing.

147
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:38,993
Put it through the thing.

148
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:42,698
I... don't have 10 bucks.

149
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:46,033
Yes. Give me the 20.

150
00:16:46,608 --> 00:16:47,943
And you're gonna make change?

151
00:16:47,943 --> 00:16:49,808
Yes, just give me the 20.
Give it to me.

152
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:55,917
Good.

153
00:17:06,461 --> 00:17:07,894
Now take your dick out.

154
00:17:16,505 --> 00:17:17,995
Can... can I have my 10?

155
00:17:27,249 --> 00:17:28,716
Give me my 10 back. Come on!

156
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,441
Give me my 10 bucks.

157
00:17:39,528 --> 00:17:40,695
Let me hold the 10.

158
00:17:40,695 --> 00:17:43,186
Give me my 10 back and I'll
give you a tip when you're done.

159
00:17:52,974 --> 00:17:53,906
Thank you.

160
00:17:54,376 --> 00:17:55,934
Now, take your dick out!

161
00:17:56,811 --> 00:17:58,711
How do we get this thing
to come down?

162
00:17:58,914 --> 00:18:00,313
It doesn't come down.

163
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:02,548
- It doesn't come down?
- No!

164
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:05,753
Well, then what the fuck am
I giving you 10 bucks for?

165
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:08,749
Look, you can touch me.

166
00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:13,422
You can touch me.

167
00:18:15,297 --> 00:18:17,492
I don't want to touch you.
I want you to touch me!

168
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:18,791
Come on! Honey, come on.

169
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,338
You're only cheating yourself.

170
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,728
The fellow over there? He's a shill.

171
00:18:48,396 --> 00:18:49,385
Who is?

172
00:18:51,366 --> 00:18:53,129
- You know how to beat the game?
- How?

173
00:18:53,768 --> 00:18:55,736
You figure out which
card has got to win...

174
00:18:56,238 --> 00:18:57,466
and bet the other one.

175
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:02,005
They're all shills.
They're all part of an act.

176
00:19:02,944 --> 00:19:04,212
Red is also
gonna get you men in black.

177
00:19:04,212 --> 00:19:05,981
20 gets you 40, 40 gets you 80.

178
00:19:05,981 --> 00:19:08,245
Cops cops cops cops.
Yo, don't run, don't run.

179
00:19:27,068 --> 00:19:28,399
Check it out, man, check it out.

180
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:30,561
Is this what you're
lookin' for, man?

181
00:19:32,173 --> 00:19:34,539
Yo, I'm sayin', take it.
I'm tryin' to give you somethin'.

182
00:19:38,146 --> 00:19:40,115
EVERYTHING
FOR THE GENTLEMAN

183
00:19:40,115 --> 00:19:41,983
Now is that what
you're lookin' for or not?

184
00:19:41,983 --> 00:19:44,611
- Is this true?
- Would I give it to you if it wasn't?

185
00:19:49,257 --> 00:19:50,622
- Hello.
- Hello.

186
00:19:50,992 --> 00:19:52,892
- Have you been here before?
- Uh, no.

187
00:19:53,194 --> 00:19:54,855
How did you hear about us?

188
00:19:56,598 --> 00:19:59,999
- Are you from out of town?
- Yes. What's the deal here?

189
00:20:00,468 --> 00:20:02,732
- This is a health club.
- I know.

190
00:20:02,937 --> 00:20:06,737
- And our rates are by the hour.
- Yes?

191
00:20:07,042 --> 00:20:11,570
$68 for the first hour.
Sauna, free bar, showers.

192
00:20:12,147 --> 00:20:15,275
The hour doesn't start until you
and the masseuse are in the room.

193
00:20:15,617 --> 00:20:16,641
All right.

194
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:19,287
Whatever happens in the room,
of course, is between you.

195
00:20:19,287 --> 00:20:20,254
I understand.

196
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:22,447
- You understand?
- Yes.

197
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:24,691
For two hours it's $150.

198
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:29,053
If you want two hostesses
that'll be $200 for one hour.

199
00:20:29,364 --> 00:20:32,299
Whatever arrangements you choose
to make with them is between you.

200
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:33,797
Good.

201
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:35,730
- What would you like?
- One hour.

202
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:38,606
You pay that now.
How would you like to pay?

203
00:20:38,606 --> 00:20:40,301
- How can I pay?
- Cash or credit.

204
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:43,272
The billing on your card will read,
"Atlantic Ski and Tennis."

205
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:46,747
I'll pay with cash. Thank you.

206
00:20:47,115 --> 00:20:48,673
Not at all. Have a lovely evening.

207
00:21:43,138 --> 00:21:45,038
- How are you?
- Fine.

208
00:21:46,341 --> 00:21:47,842
I've never done this before.

209
00:21:47,842 --> 00:21:50,470
- No?
- No. That feels good.

210
00:21:52,447 --> 00:21:55,314
- You've got a good body.
- Thank you.

211
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,785
- Do you work out?
- I jog.

212
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,684
And I used to wrestle in high school.

213
00:22:07,162 --> 00:22:09,858
- You've kept yourself in good shape.
- Thank you.

214
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,161
So what shall we do?

215
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:19,107
- I'd like to have intercourse with you.
- That sounds nice. I'd like that too.

216
00:22:19,107 --> 00:22:21,376
You would?
How much would that be?

217
00:22:21,376 --> 00:22:23,276
For a straight fuck, that'd be 250.

218
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:25,177
Th-that's too much.

219
00:22:25,914 --> 00:22:27,749
You know I'm givin' you a break...

220
00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:29,951
'cause it's your first time here.

221
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:32,353
No, it's too much on
top of the 68 at the door.

222
00:22:32,353 --> 00:22:35,186
I know, I know, I know. But, you
know, I don't get to keep it all.

223
00:22:35,423 --> 00:22:36,391
It's too much.

224
00:22:36,391 --> 00:22:38,052
I split it with them.

225
00:22:38,993 --> 00:22:40,858
Yeah, I mean, they
don't pay me, I pay them.

226
00:22:41,463 --> 00:22:42,623
It's too much.

227
00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:46,601
Okay, well,
how much do you have?

228
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:48,870
All I had was 100
for the whole thing.

229
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,168
- You mean 100 for it all?
- That only left me 30.

230
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,143
Honey, you couldn't
get a thing for that.

231
00:22:55,143 --> 00:22:56,667
Well, how much do you want?

232
00:22:58,913 --> 00:23:00,813
All right, for a straight fuck, 220.

233
00:23:01,015 --> 00:23:02,717
I couldn't pay that.

234
00:23:02,717 --> 00:23:04,219
Well, I'm sorry, then.
It would've been nice.

235
00:23:04,219 --> 00:23:06,554
- I'll give you 100.
- No.

236
00:23:06,554 --> 00:23:09,387
- 120.
- 200.

237
00:23:10,358 --> 00:23:13,228
- Because this is your first time.
- I know.

238
00:23:13,228 --> 00:23:15,696
- Because we split with them.
- I understand.

239
00:23:17,098 --> 00:23:19,464
- All right, 200.
- Thank you.

240
00:23:19,968 --> 00:23:21,435
I appreciate this.

241
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:26,140
Would it offend
you if I wore a rubber?

242
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,300
Not at all.

243
00:23:27,842 --> 00:23:29,469
- Do you have one?
- Yes.

244
00:23:31,212 --> 00:23:33,578
- Do you want to pay me now?
- Yes, certainly.

245
00:23:42,557 --> 00:23:43,785
I need cash, honey.

246
00:23:44,392 --> 00:23:46,553
- They said at the door...
- You have to pay me with cash.

247
00:23:47,262 --> 00:23:49,264
I don't think I have it, but...

248
00:23:49,264 --> 00:23:52,233
- Well, how much do you have?
- Well, I, um... only 60.

249
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:55,570
Oh! Jeez. I'm sorry,
honey, I can't do it.

250
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,801
Well... well, wait, wait.
Maybe you could... wait!

251
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:02,010
You know, why don't you
go get it and come back here?

252
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,211
Well, where could I get it?

253
00:24:03,211 --> 00:24:06,214
Go to an ATM or a
restaurant and cash a check.

254
00:24:06,214 --> 00:24:08,842
- I'll be here till 4:00.
- I'll... I'll...

255
00:24:10,018 --> 00:24:12,452
- Yes, thank you.
- Not at all.

256
00:24:28,736 --> 00:24:29,504
See?

257
00:24:29,504 --> 00:24:31,972
Here you go. You can't
win if you don't play.

258
00:24:33,241 --> 00:24:35,106
- You, sir?
- Me?

259
00:24:35,643 --> 00:24:37,611
- You gonna try me again?
- "Again"?

260
00:24:38,546 --> 00:24:41,115
I remember you beat me out that
50 that time with your girlfriend.

261
00:24:41,115 --> 00:24:43,174
- When was this?
- On 14th Street.

262
00:24:43,585 --> 00:24:44,950
You gonna try me one more time?

263
00:24:45,954 --> 00:24:47,922
Play for that 50. 50 gets you 100.

264
00:24:47,922 --> 00:24:49,357
We'll see who's fast as you was.

265
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:51,092
Pay on the red, pass to the
black.

266
00:24:51,092 --> 00:24:53,652
Where's the queen? You
pick the queen, you win.

267
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:56,453
Where's the queen?
You put a 50, win 100.

268
00:24:57,899 --> 00:24:59,264
Now, who saw the queen?

269
00:24:59,534 --> 00:25:00,865
- I got her.
- How much?

270
00:25:01,302 --> 00:25:02,496
Put your money up. How much?

271
00:25:03,104 --> 00:25:04,901
- Uh, I bet 50 bucks.
- Put it up.

272
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:07,332
There.

273
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:10,044
My man, I'm just too
quick for you today.

274
00:25:10,044 --> 00:25:12,347
We got two cards left.
Who saw the queen?

275
00:25:12,347 --> 00:25:14,941
We got two cards left.
Pay on the red queen. Who saw her?

276
00:25:15,283 --> 00:25:18,150
- I saw her.
- Aw, shit, man, he too fast for me.

277
00:25:18,786 --> 00:25:19,810
For $50?

278
00:25:20,955 --> 00:25:22,786
All right, all right. Put it up.

279
00:25:23,124 --> 00:25:24,819
Will you pay me if I win?

280
00:25:24,993 --> 00:25:28,485
Yes, I will. If you win.
But you got to win first.

281
00:25:28,696 --> 00:25:30,960
- All I got to do is turn the queen?
- That's all you got to do.

282
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,232
I'll bet you $50.

283
00:25:33,735 --> 00:25:35,293
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

284
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:36,525
Put it up.

285
00:25:37,772 --> 00:25:38,568
Now...

286
00:25:39,907 --> 00:25:41,272
which one you like?

287
00:25:41,643 --> 00:25:42,541
There.

288
00:25:43,511 --> 00:25:44,739
WHEEL OF FORTUNE

289
00:25:46,948 --> 00:25:49,550
I'm sorry, my man.
This time you lose.

290
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,142
Now we even. Take another shot.

291
00:25:51,352 --> 00:25:53,582
You pick the queen, you win.
I'll bet you another 50.

292
00:25:53,988 --> 00:25:55,023
Let me see those cards.

293
00:25:55,023 --> 00:25:56,650
These cards is fine.
It's you that's slow.

294
00:25:56,924 --> 00:25:59,260
- I want to see those cards.
- These cards are good. You lost.

295
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,294
You show me those cards.

296
00:26:00,294 --> 00:26:02,430
You ain't seein' no motherfuckin'
cards. We're playin' a game here.

297
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,159
You lost, man. Get lost.

298
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,101
You let me see those cards, fella.

299
00:26:07,101 --> 00:26:09,337
You wanna see these cards?
You wanna see these cards?

300
00:26:09,337 --> 00:26:10,770
Here's your motherfuckin' cards!

301
00:26:24,886 --> 00:26:25,511
Turn around!

302
00:26:32,126 --> 00:26:33,525
He said... he said my cards...

303
00:26:36,164 --> 00:26:37,529
Come on, let's get out of here.

304
00:27:07,695 --> 00:27:08,684
I want a room.

305
00:27:10,331 --> 00:27:11,559
$22.

306
00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:13,389
I lost my wallet.

307
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,571
Go to the police.

308
00:27:16,571 --> 00:27:18,172
You can call up American Express.

309
00:27:18,172 --> 00:27:20,475
Go to the police.
I don't want to hear about it.

310
00:27:20,475 --> 00:27:23,444
You can call the credit card people.
I... I have insurance.

311
00:27:23,778 --> 00:27:26,406
You can call them yourself.
Right across the hall.

312
00:27:30,685 --> 00:27:31,982
I have no money.

313
00:27:33,688 --> 00:27:35,519
I'm sure it's a free call.

314
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:46,261
- Does that phone require a coin?
- I'm sure I don't know.

315
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:50,360
You know if it needs a coin
or not to get a dial tone.

316
00:27:51,105 --> 00:27:53,232
You know if it needs a coin,
for Christ's sake.

317
00:27:53,441 --> 00:27:55,068
You want to live in that kind of world?

318
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,478
You want to live in a world like that?

319
00:27:57,712 --> 00:27:59,703
I've been hurt. Are you blind?

320
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:02,315
Would you appreciate it
if I acted this way to you?

321
00:28:03,217 --> 00:28:06,948
I ask you one simple thing:
Does it need a coin?

322
00:28:09,891 --> 00:28:12,724
No. It doesn't need a coin.

323
00:28:16,931 --> 00:28:20,867
You make your call and
then you go somewhere else!

324
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:34,273
Please deposit ¢75 for
the first three minutes.

325
00:28:52,867 --> 00:28:54,836
What do you get for that?
What is that, 14 or 19?

326
00:28:54,836 --> 00:28:55,734
14.

327
00:28:56,304 --> 00:28:58,339
Yeah? Let me see that.
How much is that?

328
00:28:58,339 --> 00:28:59,738
685.

329
00:29:00,308 --> 00:29:02,276
Why is that? How old is that?
Is that old?

330
00:29:02,276 --> 00:29:06,610
You know how much gold
you got in there? Feel that.

331
00:29:07,682 --> 00:29:09,081
Where is it marked?

332
00:29:09,483 --> 00:29:12,452
- Right there. You want the loupe?
- No, I can see it.

333
00:29:20,228 --> 00:29:21,126
What?

334
00:29:21,495 --> 00:29:24,623
- I want to pawn something.
- Talk to the man in back.

335
00:29:28,135 --> 00:29:29,727
- I want to pawn something.
- What?

336
00:29:29,971 --> 00:29:31,768
- My ring.
- Take it off.

337
00:29:38,045 --> 00:29:40,479
- It's difficult to take it off.
- Spit on it.

338
00:29:44,418 --> 00:29:45,476
I got it off.

339
00:29:48,089 --> 00:29:50,057
What do you want to do with this?
You want to pawn it?

340
00:29:50,057 --> 00:29:52,493
- Yes, how does that work?
- Is that what you want to do?

341
00:29:52,493 --> 00:29:54,393
- Yes.
- Are there other things to do?

342
00:29:54,695 --> 00:29:57,565
What you can do, no.
I mean, if you wanted it appraised...

343
00:29:57,565 --> 00:29:59,834
or wanted to sell it,
or if you wanted it to pawn.

344
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:01,358
- I understand.
- All right?

345
00:30:01,602 --> 00:30:03,900
- How much to get it appraised?
- $5.

346
00:30:05,373 --> 00:30:08,001
- What would you give me?
- How much you want for it?

347
00:30:08,276 --> 00:30:09,436
Whatever it's worth.

348
00:30:09,744 --> 00:30:13,281
You pawn it, all you're gonna get...
you know how this works?

349
00:30:13,281 --> 00:30:14,448
No.

350
00:30:14,448 --> 00:30:16,575
What you get, a quarter of the value.

351
00:30:17,485 --> 00:30:19,953
Approximately for one year,
you're paying 12%.

352
00:30:20,221 --> 00:30:21,789
You can redeem your pledge with the year...

353
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:24,257
you pay the 12% to that time
plus the amount of the loan.

354
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:27,662
- What is my pledge?
- Well, that depends on what it is.

355
00:30:27,662 --> 00:30:28,529
What do you mean?

356
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:30,431
- What it is. Do you understand?
- No.

357
00:30:30,431 --> 00:30:33,134
Whatever the amount is,
that is your pledge.

358
00:30:33,134 --> 00:30:34,802
- The amount of the loan?
- That's right.

359
00:30:34,802 --> 00:30:36,003
I understand.

360
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:37,493
What are you looking for the ring?

361
00:30:38,773 --> 00:30:39,874
What's it worth?

362
00:30:39,874 --> 00:30:42,843
The most I can give you is 120 bucks.

363
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:50,642
- I'll take it.
- I'll be back. Give me the ring.

364
00:30:53,487 --> 00:30:56,217
This is nice.
What are you asking for this?

365
00:30:56,424 --> 00:30:59,052
43 bucks. 40 bucks.

366
00:31:02,797 --> 00:31:04,025
40 bucks.

367
00:31:04,598 --> 00:31:07,999
- Why's it so expensive?
- Why is it so expensive?

368
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:12,296
No, I'm gonna pass.
I'll catch ya later. Thanks.

369
00:31:14,008 --> 00:31:15,339
Why is the knife so expensive?

370
00:31:15,576 --> 00:31:19,342
This is survival knife.
GI issue. World War I.

371
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:20,873
And that is why.

372
00:31:21,082 --> 00:31:23,050
- Survival knife.
- That is correct.

373
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:23,982
Is it a good knife?

374
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,688
Is the best knife money can buy.

375
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,384
SWORD

376
00:31:34,862 --> 00:31:36,090
You want it?

377
00:31:42,837 --> 00:31:44,566
What are you lookin' for?

378
00:31:46,407 --> 00:31:47,374
What?

379
00:31:47,842 --> 00:31:51,479
- What are you looking for?
- I'm not lookin' for nothing.

380
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:53,414
If you're lookin' for that
joint, it's closed.

381
00:31:53,414 --> 00:31:55,905
- What joint?
- That joint you was lookin' for.

382
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:59,020
Thanks, no, I'm not lookin'
for that joint.

383
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,123
Well, you lookin' for somethin', and
I think I know what you lookin' for.

384
00:32:02,123 --> 00:32:03,190
You do?

385
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,593
Yeah, you come with me.
I get you what you want.

386
00:32:05,593 --> 00:32:07,361
What am I looking for?

387
00:32:07,361 --> 00:32:11,532
I know. We'll get you some action.
We'll get you something sweet.

388
00:32:11,532 --> 00:32:13,334
I know.
That's what I'm doin' here.

389
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:14,869
What are you saying?

390
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:17,505
I'm sayin' we gonna find
you somethin' nice.

391
00:32:17,505 --> 00:32:19,106
You're saying you're
gonna find me a woman?

392
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:20,903
That's what I'm
doin' out here, friend.

393
00:32:21,342 --> 00:32:23,139
- How much?
- Well, how much you want?

394
00:32:24,378 --> 00:32:25,902
- I want somebody clean.
- That's right.

395
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:27,415
- I want a blowjob.
- All right.

396
00:32:27,415 --> 00:32:28,848
- How much?
- 100 bucks.

397
00:32:29,016 --> 00:32:30,051
That's too much.

398
00:32:30,051 --> 00:32:31,245
Well, how much you wanna spend?

399
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:34,417
Say, $35.

400
00:32:34,855 --> 00:32:36,254
- 60.
- No.

401
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,023
- 40?
- Yes.

402
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,551
- Is that all right?
- Give me the 40.

403
00:32:41,095 --> 00:32:43,364
I'll give you the 40
when we see the girl.

404
00:32:43,364 --> 00:32:45,924
I'm not gonna leave you. You comin'
with me. We goin' to see the girl.

405
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,200
Good.
I'll give it to you then.

406
00:32:48,602 --> 00:32:52,402
You give it to me now, man, understand?
That's the transaction.

407
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:57,011
Unless you a cop, you give me the
money, then that's entrapment.

408
00:32:57,011 --> 00:32:58,479
Yes. I'm not a cop.

409
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:00,470
All right.
You see what I'm sayin'?

410
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:06,013
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

411
00:33:09,123 --> 00:33:11,792
Now, you come with me,
we'll walk here like we're talkin'.

412
00:33:11,792 --> 00:33:15,319
- Is she going to be clean?
- Yes, she is. I understand you, man.

413
00:33:15,729 --> 00:33:17,788
I understand what you want.
Believe me.

414
00:33:18,632 --> 00:33:19,800
Is there any money in this?

415
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,792
Well, you know, there's some.
You get done piecin' off the police...

416
00:33:23,104 --> 00:33:25,539
this man here, the medical,
the bills, you know.

417
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:27,666
- How much does the girl get?
- 60%. Oh, yeah.

418
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:29,942
Uh, it's right up here.

419
00:33:43,924 --> 00:33:46,757
All right, motherfucker, now give
me all your money! All of it! Now!

420
00:33:47,094 --> 00:33:48,129
All right.

421
00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:50,998
Don't turn around.
Just hand me all you've got.

422
00:33:50,998 --> 00:33:51,999
All right.

423
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:53,534
Don't you make
a motherfuckin' sound.

424
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:54,969
I'm gonna do everything you say.

425
00:33:54,969 --> 00:33:57,403
You just hand me all you've got.

426
00:34:04,712 --> 00:34:06,612
- You motherfucking nigger!
- Hold on!

427
00:34:08,782 --> 00:34:10,147
Motherfucking shit!

428
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,413
Jungle bunny!

429
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:17,889
You coon! You cunt!
You cocksucker!

430
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,121
- Take me upstairs?
- Oh my God!

431
00:34:23,164 --> 00:34:24,791
You fuck! You nigger!

432
00:34:25,432 --> 00:34:27,764
You dumb cunt! You shit!

433
00:34:28,602 --> 00:34:30,968
Shit! You fucking nigger!

434
00:34:32,506 --> 00:34:34,770
Don't fuck with me, you coon!

435
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:43,214
I hope you're dead!

436
00:35:07,775 --> 00:35:08,833
I want a cup of coffee.

437
00:35:09,577 --> 00:35:10,976
No. A beer.

438
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:13,576
Irish whiskey.

439
00:35:13,981 --> 00:35:16,108
- Irish whiskey?
- Yes. A double.

440
00:35:16,383 --> 00:35:19,147
- Beer chaser.
- You're in a peppy mood today.

441
00:35:19,353 --> 00:35:20,650
You're goddamn right I am.

442
00:35:30,664 --> 00:35:34,031
And do you know why?
Because I am alive.

443
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:38,230
You know how much of our life
we're alive you and I? Nothing!

444
00:35:38,706 --> 00:35:40,139
Two minutes out of the year.

445
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:42,841
When we meet someone new.
When we get married.

446
00:35:43,043 --> 00:35:44,533
When... when...

447
00:35:45,045 --> 00:35:46,410
when we're in difficulties.

448
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,605
In a car crash. And that's it.

449
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,284
You know, we're sheltered.

450
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:55,322
- Who is?
- You and I. White people.

451
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:59,360
All of us. The white race is doomed.
And do you know why?

452
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,521
- Sit down.
- I can't, I'm working.

453
00:36:03,097 --> 00:36:05,532
You can do anything you want to do.
You don't sit 'cause you're working.

454
00:36:05,532 --> 00:36:07,935
The reason you don't sit down
is you don't want to sit down...

455
00:36:07,935 --> 00:36:10,204
because it's more
comfortable to accept a law...

456
00:36:10,204 --> 00:36:12,365
than question it and live your life.

457
00:36:13,274 --> 00:36:16,510
All of us. We've bred
the life out of ourselves!

458
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:20,241
We live in a fog. In a dream.
And we are dead.

459
00:36:20,848 --> 00:36:22,611
- How old are you?
- 23.

460
00:36:23,217 --> 00:36:27,187
I've lived in a fog 47 years.
Most of the life, it's gone.

461
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:30,324
I wasted it because I didn't know.

462
00:36:30,324 --> 00:36:35,956
And you know what the answer is?
To live. That's it.

463
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:43,197
In one moment, for which
I thank God. To live!

464
00:36:51,912 --> 00:36:53,277
I want to tell you something.

465
00:36:55,149 --> 00:36:58,346
No one's going to know.
Just you. That's all.

466
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:01,354
No one's keeping score,
and no one cares.

467
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:08,826
- I want to go home with you tonight.
- Why?

468
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,862
Why do you think?
I want to fuck you.

469
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:14,995
It's as simple as that.

470
00:37:16,804 --> 00:37:18,203
- What's your name?
- Glenna.

471
00:37:19,273 --> 00:37:21,104
- You see this?
- Yes.

472
00:37:21,842 --> 00:37:25,107
That fuckin' nigger comes up to me...
"Gimme all your money."

473
00:37:25,346 --> 00:37:30,751
47 years fits me to sweat and say:
"He's underpaid. He can't get a job.

474
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:34,421
He's bigger than me. He's a killer.
He don't care about his life...

475
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:36,223
so he'd do anything".

476
00:37:36,223 --> 00:37:37,991
That's what I'm fitted to do.

477
00:37:37,991 --> 00:37:42,696
In a mess of intellectuality
to wet my pants...

478
00:37:42,696 --> 00:37:44,891
while this coon
cuts my dick off, huh?

479
00:37:45,366 --> 00:37:48,035
Because I'm taught to hate.

480
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:49,593
I want to tell you something.

481
00:37:50,304 --> 00:37:52,932
Something spoke to me.
I got a shock.

482
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,768
I spoke back to him,
that motherfucker!

483
00:37:56,043 --> 00:37:59,069
I came out there with my knife,
and I stuck it in his neck!

484
00:37:59,313 --> 00:38:02,510
Up your ass, you coon!
You wanna fight? I'll fight you!

485
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:05,486
I'll cut your fuckin' heart out!
I don't give a fuck!

486
00:38:05,486 --> 00:38:07,321
- Yes?
- I don't give a fuck.

487
00:38:07,321 --> 00:38:11,519
I got some warlike blood
in my veins too, ya fuckin' spade!

488
00:38:11,725 --> 00:38:13,522
The blood ran down his neck.

489
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:15,692
- With that?
- You bet your ass.

490
00:38:17,831 --> 00:38:18,661
Did you kill him?

491
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:20,527
- Did I kill him?
- Yes.

492
00:38:21,402 --> 00:38:23,996
- I don't care.
- That's wonderful.

493
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,010
And in that moment, when I spoke...

494
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,179
you understand, 'cause that was
more important than the knife...

495
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:35,148
I didn't fucking want to understand.
Let him understand me.

496
00:38:35,449 --> 00:38:38,145
I wanted to kill him,
and in that moment...

497
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:41,755
47 years of prejudice
came out of me...

498
00:38:41,755 --> 00:38:44,690
47 years of all those...

499
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,996
of all those cleaning ladies...

500
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:52,159
who might have broke the lamp.
So what?

501
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:54,935
I swear to God,
for the first time I saw...

502
00:38:54,935 --> 00:38:56,459
they're people too!

503
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,239
- You know who I hate?
- No, who's that?

504
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:01,208
- Faggots.
- Yes, I hate them too.

505
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:02,476
- Do you know why?
- Why?

506
00:39:02,476 --> 00:39:05,411
They suck cock. And that's
the truest thing you'll ever hear.

507
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,981
I hate them because they
don't like women.

508
00:39:07,981 --> 00:39:09,539
- They hate women.
- I know that they do.

509
00:39:10,651 --> 00:39:12,812
- It feels good to say it, doesn't it?
- Yes.

510
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,883
Then say it. Say it.

511
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:19,390
If it makes you feel whole,
always say it, always, for yourself.

512
00:39:19,793 --> 00:39:21,784
- It's hard.
- Yes.

513
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:24,896
- Sometimes it's hard.
- You're goddamn right it's hard.

514
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:28,101
And there's a reason why it's hard.

515
00:39:28,101 --> 00:39:29,203
Why?

516
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:32,866
So that we will stand up.
Glenna, there is no law.

517
00:39:33,474 --> 00:39:35,840
There is no history.
There's only now.

518
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:38,579
And if there's a God,
he may love the weak, Glenna...

519
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:40,547
but he respects the strong.

520
00:39:40,781 --> 00:39:47,482
And if you are a man, you should be feared.
You must know you command respect.

521
00:39:48,622 --> 00:39:50,647
- That's why I love the theater.
- Yes.

522
00:39:50,858 --> 00:39:53,460
Because what you must
ask respect for is yourself.

523
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,128
- What do you mean?
- When you're on stage.

524
00:39:55,128 --> 00:39:56,163
Yes.

525
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:58,298
- For your feelings.
- Absolutely! Absolutely, yes!

526
00:39:58,298 --> 00:40:00,267
- And not be someone else!
- Why should you?

527
00:40:00,267 --> 00:40:02,803
That's why I'm so proud
to be in this profession.

528
00:40:02,803 --> 00:40:03,904
I don't blame you.

529
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:06,573
- Because your aspirations...
- And I'll bet you're good at it.

530
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:08,275
They have no bounds.

531
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:10,277
There's nothing to
bound you but your soul!

532
00:40:10,277 --> 00:40:11,471
I understand.

533
00:40:12,713 --> 00:40:13,975
Do something for me.

534
00:40:16,283 --> 00:40:17,875
Act something for me.

535
00:40:18,785 --> 00:40:20,719
- Will you act something for me?
- Now?

536
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:22,586
- Sitting right here?
- Yes!

537
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:25,483
- Would you really like me to?
- You know I would.

538
00:40:26,026 --> 00:40:28,996
You see me sitting here.
You know I would. I'd love you to!

539
00:40:28,996 --> 00:40:30,088
- You want one?
- Nah.

540
00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:32,733
What would you like me to do?

541
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:34,735
Whatever you'd like.
What plays have you done?

542
00:40:34,735 --> 00:40:37,636
- Well, we've only done scenes.
- You've only done scenes?

543
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:41,241
I shouldn't say "only."
They contain the kernel of the play.

544
00:40:41,241 --> 00:40:43,209
What plays have you done?

545
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,705
In college, I played Juliet.

546
00:40:46,046 --> 00:40:47,377
In Shakespeare?

547
00:40:47,681 --> 00:40:49,842
Yes, in Shakespeare.
What do you think?

548
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:53,220
Well, I just meant there's
plays named "Juliet."

549
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,621
- There are?
- Yes.

550
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:55,815
I don't think so.

551
00:40:56,156 --> 00:41:01,128
Well, there are.
Don't... don't... don't be so limited

552
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:04,631
and don't assume I'm dumb
because I wear a suit and tie.

553
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:05,666
I don't assume that.

554
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:08,201
Because what we've done tonight,
since you met me...

555
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:10,066
it didn't make a difference then.

556
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,174
Forget it. All I meant...

557
00:41:17,344 --> 00:41:19,335
- You say you're an actress.
- I am an actress.

558
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:23,107
That's what you say, so I say:
"What plays have you done?" That's all.

559
00:41:23,317 --> 00:41:25,452
The work I've done,
I've done for my peers.

560
00:41:25,452 --> 00:41:26,987
- What does that mean?
- In class.

561
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:28,852
- "In class"?
- In class or workshop.

562
00:41:29,089 --> 00:41:32,388
- Not for a paying group?
- No, absolutely not.

563
00:41:32,859 --> 00:41:35,384
Then you're not an actress.
Face it.

564
00:41:37,297 --> 00:41:39,458
Let's start right, the two of us.

565
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,735
I'm not lying to you,
don't lie to me...

566
00:41:41,735 --> 00:41:45,172
and don't lie to yourself.
You are a beautiful woman.

567
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:47,541
You have worlds before you.
I do too.

568
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:50,669
What I'm saying, start now,
start tonight, with me.

569
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:53,973
- Be what you are.
- I am what I am.

570
00:41:54,414 --> 00:41:58,612
That is right and that's what I
loved when I saw you tonight.

571
00:41:59,186 --> 00:42:01,950
What I loved. I use that word.

572
00:42:02,422 --> 00:42:05,292
I loved a woman, standing there...

573
00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:08,862
a working woman who brought
life to what she did...

574
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:12,032
who took a moment to joke with me!

575
00:42:12,032 --> 00:42:16,401
God bless what you are!
Say it. "I am a waitress!"

576
00:42:18,138 --> 00:42:19,706
What does it mean
if I say something?

577
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:21,174
- Say it with me!
- What?

578
00:42:21,174 --> 00:42:22,505
I am a waitress!

579
00:42:23,343 --> 00:42:24,742
I think that you'd better go.

580
00:42:25,579 --> 00:42:27,381
If you want me to go, I'll go.

581
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:30,450
Say it with me... what you are.
And I'll say what I am.

582
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,619
Say what you are, and
I'll say what I am.

583
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:34,888
- What you are?
- I've made that discovery.

584
00:42:34,888 --> 00:42:37,691
Now, I want you to change
your life with me! Right now!

585
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:40,927
For whatever that it can be! I don't
know what that is, you don't know.

586
00:42:40,927 --> 00:42:44,564
- Speak with me, right now! Say it!
- I don't know what you're talking about!

587
00:42:44,564 --> 00:42:47,692
Oh, but the Lord, yes you do.
Say it with me!

588
00:42:49,903 --> 00:42:51,564
- What are those?
- Pills.

589
00:42:51,805 --> 00:42:54,174
For what? Don't take them.
Go through it with me!

590
00:42:54,174 --> 00:42:56,699
- I have this tendency to get anxious.
- Don't take them!

591
00:42:56,777 --> 00:42:59,905
Go through it!
Go through it with me!

592
00:42:59,946 --> 00:43:01,048
You're scaring me!

593
00:43:01,048 --> 00:43:03,684
I am not! I know when I'm
scaring you, believe me.

594
00:43:03,684 --> 00:43:04,651
- Get out!
- Glenna!

595
00:43:04,651 --> 00:43:06,887
Get out! Get out! Get out!

596
00:43:06,887 --> 00:43:09,923
Leave me the fuck alone!
What did I do, pledge my life to you?

597
00:43:09,923 --> 00:43:12,325
I let you fuck me! Go away!

598
00:43:12,325 --> 00:43:14,394
Listen to me.
You know what madness is?

599
00:43:14,394 --> 00:43:16,521
- I told you, go away!
- Listen to me.

600
00:43:18,165 --> 00:43:21,568
Lis... I'm lonely too.
I know what it is too, believe me.

601
00:43:21,568 --> 00:43:23,403
- You know what madness is?
- Suzy?

602
00:43:23,403 --> 00:43:25,005
It's self-indulgence.

603
00:43:25,005 --> 00:43:26,273
Suze, can you come over here?

604
00:43:26,273 --> 00:43:29,606
Will you please put that down!
Do you know how rare this is?

605
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:32,379
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm talking to you!

606
00:43:32,379 --> 00:43:35,348
Don't hurt me!
I... no, I can't deal with this.

607
00:43:35,348 --> 00:43:39,286
- You're being ridiculous!
- I... no... no. Help! Help!

608
00:43:39,286 --> 00:43:43,245
Would you shut the fuck up?
What are you trying to do?

609
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:44,591
Help!

610
00:43:44,591 --> 00:43:47,082
- You wanna wake the neighbors?
- Will somebody help me?

611
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,697
- Shut up!
- Help! Will somebody help?

612
00:43:50,697 --> 00:43:53,800
You get away from me! You are
the devil! I know who you are!

613
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,836
I know what you want me to do!
Get away from me!

614
00:43:55,836 --> 00:43:57,604
I curse you!
Get away from me!

615
00:43:57,604 --> 00:43:59,906
- You shut the fuck up!
- You can't kill me! I'm good!

616
00:43:59,906 --> 00:44:01,541
You stupid fucking bitch!

617
00:44:01,541 --> 00:44:03,510
You're nuts! Are you insane?

618
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,445
Are you insane?
You fucking bitch!

619
00:44:05,445 --> 00:44:07,080
You stupid fucking bitch!

620
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,479
You stupid fucking...

621
00:44:23,797 --> 00:44:25,424
Now look what you've done.

622
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:29,799
Now look what
you've bloody fucking done.

623
00:45:08,275 --> 00:45:09,765
My mother had a hat like that.

624
00:45:14,714 --> 00:45:16,409
My mother had a hat like that.

625
00:45:17,918 --> 00:45:19,476
I'm not making conversation.

626
00:45:21,555 --> 00:45:24,854
She wore it for years.
She wore it when I was a child.

627
00:45:27,093 --> 00:45:29,329
I didn't just make it up.
It happened.

628
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:30,353
Excuse me.

629
00:45:31,031 --> 00:45:33,967
Who the fuck do you think
you are? I'm talking to you!

630
00:45:33,967 --> 00:45:37,137
What am I, a stone? Did I say,
"I want to lick your pussy"?

631
00:45:37,137 --> 00:45:39,472
I said my mother had that same hat!

632
00:45:39,472 --> 00:45:41,775
You cunt! What am I, a dog?

633
00:45:41,775 --> 00:45:44,141
I'd like to slash your fucking face!

634
00:45:44,377 --> 00:45:47,214
I'd like to slash your motherfucking
face apart!

635
00:45:47,214 --> 00:45:48,738
Will somebody help me?

636
00:45:49,149 --> 00:45:52,949
You don't know who I am!
Is everybody in this town insane?

637
00:45:54,187 --> 00:45:56,121
Fuck you! Fuck you!

638
00:45:56,857 --> 00:46:00,156
Fuck you! Fuck the lot of you!

639
00:46:00,694 --> 00:46:01,786
I don't need you!

640
00:46:02,929 --> 00:46:04,556
I worked all my life!

641
00:46:06,366 --> 00:46:07,765
I worked all my life!

642
00:46:11,137 --> 00:46:12,434
I worked all my life.

643
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,053
You say, "Oh, no, not me.

644
00:46:30,757 --> 00:46:33,817
Not me, Lord, to whom
you hold out Your hand.

645
00:46:35,228 --> 00:46:38,356
Not me to whom You
offer Your eternal grace.

646
00:46:39,766 --> 00:46:41,791
Not me who can be saved."

647
00:46:42,869 --> 00:46:46,100
But who but you, I ask?
Who but you?

648
00:46:47,774 --> 00:46:49,332
You say you are a grievous sinner?

649
00:46:50,777 --> 00:46:52,369
He knows that you are!

650
00:46:53,179 --> 00:46:56,478
You say: "He does not
know the depth of my iniquity".

651
00:46:57,484 --> 00:46:59,577
Believe me, friends, He does.

652
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:03,519
And still you say:
"He does not know".

653
00:47:06,593 --> 00:47:09,221
You say this in your secret soul.

654
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:13,695
"He does not know the
terrible depth of my unbelief."

655
00:47:14,401 --> 00:47:17,199
Believe me,
friends, He knows that too.

656
00:47:17,637 --> 00:47:22,597
To all who say His grace is not
meant to one as black as you...

657
00:47:23,376 --> 00:47:25,867
I say, "Who but you?"

658
00:47:25,979 --> 00:47:27,003
To you alone.

659
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:29,047
Not to the blessed.

660
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:32,677
You think that
Christ died for the blessed?

661
00:47:33,553 --> 00:47:35,612
That He died for the heavenly host?

662
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,453
That did not make Him God!

663
00:47:40,593 --> 00:47:42,117
It does not need a God.

664
00:47:42,395 --> 00:47:43,123
For you!

665
00:47:45,031 --> 00:47:48,865
There is none so black
but that He died for you.

666
00:47:50,737 --> 00:47:54,195
It's required of God
to sacrifice for man.

667
00:47:55,141 --> 00:47:56,233
You hear me?

668
00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:00,311
For you!
He died especially for you.

669
00:48:02,015 --> 00:48:05,246
Upon my life
on the graves of my family...

670
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:10,020
and by the surety
I have of his eternal bliss.

671
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:14,256
He died for you, and you are saved!

672
00:48:16,596 --> 00:48:18,120
Praise God, my friends!

673
00:48:18,865 --> 00:48:20,457
Praise God and testify.

674
00:48:21,301 --> 00:48:24,168
Who will come up and
testify with me, my friends?

675
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:26,963
Who will come up and testify?

676
00:48:28,141 --> 00:48:30,473
Who will testify for Jesus?

677
00:48:31,444 --> 00:48:33,207
Who will testify with me?

678
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,770
I will testify.

679
00:48:36,883 --> 00:48:37,872
Who is that?

680
00:48:39,152 --> 00:48:40,585
I will testify!

681
00:48:40,887 --> 00:48:43,185
Sweet God, let that man come forth!

682
00:48:46,026 --> 00:48:49,792
Who will come open up his soul?
Hallelujah, my friends!

683
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:51,292
Be with me!

684
00:48:52,232 --> 00:48:54,167
That's the man! That's the man!

685
00:48:54,167 --> 00:48:56,158
Get him now! That's him! Stop him!

686
00:48:57,003 --> 00:48:59,801
Where is that man?
Let him come forth!

687
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,341
Just a minute, sir.

688
00:49:01,341 --> 00:49:03,543
I... I'm on my way to church.

689
00:49:03,543 --> 00:49:06,512
Sweet Jesus, let that man
come forth!

690
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,272
That's the man that
tried to rape me on the train!

691
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,885
What's this all about, sir?

692
00:49:15,221 --> 00:49:18,324
- He had a knife!
- Must be some mistake.

693
00:49:18,324 --> 00:49:21,555
He tried to rape me. That's the man
who tried to rape me on the train!

694
00:49:22,062 --> 00:49:24,564
There's some mistake.
I'm on my way to church.

695
00:49:24,564 --> 00:49:25,965
What's the trouble here?

696
00:49:25,965 --> 00:49:29,059
No problem. I'm on my
way into this mission.

697
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:32,634
This man tried to
rape me on the train!

698
00:49:32,939 --> 00:49:34,907
Obviously the woman is mad.

699
00:49:35,241 --> 00:49:37,043
Can I see some identification,
please?

700
00:49:37,043 --> 00:49:39,379
Please, officer, I... I haven't time.

701
00:49:39,379 --> 00:49:41,210
It's been a long...

702
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:45,351
I don't have my wallet on me.

703
00:49:45,351 --> 00:49:49,310
My name is Gregory Burke.
I live at 428, 22nd Street.

704
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:50,683
I own the building.

705
00:49:51,024 --> 00:49:53,151
I have to... preach.

706
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,596
- You're gonna show me some ID.
- I don't have any, I told you.

707
00:49:56,596 --> 00:49:58,231
Well, you're gonna have
to come with me.

708
00:49:58,231 --> 00:50:01,501
Yes, but in one moment.
Not now. I have to preach.

709
00:50:01,501 --> 00:50:03,536
- Come on.
- Please. You're making a mistake.

710
00:50:03,536 --> 00:50:06,673
Let me go, and I'll...
I'll come with you afterwards.

711
00:50:06,673 --> 00:50:09,005
I swear I will.
I swear it on my life.

712
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:12,278
There's been, uh, some
sort of a mistake.

713
00:50:12,278 --> 00:50:14,439
I'm an elder in this church.

714
00:50:14,714 --> 00:50:17,283
Come with me, if you will.
I have to speak.

715
00:50:17,283 --> 00:50:20,514
Look... What's that?

716
00:50:21,254 --> 00:50:22,152
Nothing.

717
00:50:28,928 --> 00:50:30,361
It's a knife.

718
00:50:31,197 --> 00:50:32,425
It's there for self-protection.

719
00:50:35,602 --> 00:50:36,626
What was the knife for?

720
00:50:37,237 --> 00:50:38,704
For protection.

721
00:50:39,372 --> 00:50:41,340
- From whom?
- Everyone.

722
00:50:44,744 --> 00:50:46,803
- You know that it's illegal?
- No.

723
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,338
It is.

724
00:50:49,315 --> 00:50:50,717
I'm sorry.

725
00:50:50,717 --> 00:50:53,419
Speaking to that woman in the way
you did is construed as assault.

726
00:50:53,419 --> 00:50:54,721
I never spoke to her.

727
00:50:54,721 --> 00:50:57,557
She identified you as the man
who accosted her last evening.

728
00:50:57,557 --> 00:50:59,092
She is seriously mistaken.

729
00:50:59,092 --> 00:51:01,227
If she presses charges,
you'll be arraigned for assault.

730
00:51:01,227 --> 00:51:02,455
For speaking to her?

731
00:51:02,729 --> 00:51:04,697
You admit that you
were speaking to her?

732
00:51:10,803 --> 00:51:12,236
I want to ask you something.

733
00:51:13,673 --> 00:51:14,640
All right.

734
00:51:14,874 --> 00:51:18,275
Did you ever kick a dog?
Well, that's what I did.

735
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:21,147
Man to man, that's what I did.

736
00:51:21,147 --> 00:51:25,516
I made a harmless comment to her.
She responded like a fucking bitch!

737
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,322
Did you try to pick her up?

738
00:51:29,322 --> 00:51:30,857
Why would I try to pick her up?

739
00:51:30,857 --> 00:51:33,693
- She was an attractive woman.
- She was not an attractive woman.

740
00:51:33,693 --> 00:51:37,664
- You gay?
- What business is that of yours?

741
00:51:37,664 --> 00:51:39,063
- Are you?
- No!

742
00:51:39,265 --> 00:51:40,300
You married?

743
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,268
Yes, in fact.
I was going back to my wife.

744
00:51:42,268 --> 00:51:46,272
- You were going back to your wife?
- I was... going home to her.

745
00:51:46,272 --> 00:51:48,297
You said you were going back
to her. What did you mean?

746
00:51:49,309 --> 00:51:50,936
I'd left my wife, all right?

747
00:51:51,544 --> 00:51:53,179
- You left your wife?
- Yes.

748
00:51:53,179 --> 00:51:54,237
Why?

749
00:51:55,548 --> 00:51:58,574
I was bored.
Didn't that ever happen to you?

750
00:52:02,922 --> 00:52:05,322
- And why did you lie to the officer?
- What officer?

751
00:52:05,725 --> 00:52:07,060
Who picked you up.

752
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:09,324
There's no Gregory Burke
at the address you gave.

753
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:12,393
You didn't give him
your right name.

754
00:52:16,302 --> 00:52:18,930
- I was embarrassed.
- Why?

755
00:52:19,806 --> 00:52:21,637
- I didn't have my wallet.
- Why?

756
00:52:22,742 --> 00:52:25,345
- I'd left it at home.
- Why did that embarrass you?

757
00:52:25,345 --> 00:52:27,540
I don't know! I have had no sleep!

758
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:29,441
I just want to go home!

759
00:52:30,783 --> 00:52:31,943
I am a solid...

760
00:52:34,087 --> 00:52:35,315
Look...

761
00:52:38,424 --> 00:52:39,721
my name is Edmond Burke.

762
00:52:40,059 --> 00:52:42,161
I live at 485, West 79th Street.

763
00:52:42,161 --> 00:52:44,297
I work at Stearns & Harrington.

764
00:52:44,297 --> 00:52:49,428
I had a tiff with my wife. I went out,
I've learned my lesson.

765
00:52:50,069 --> 00:52:52,469
Believe me.
I just want to go home.

766
00:53:01,914 --> 00:53:05,251
Whatever I've done, I'll make right.

767
00:53:05,251 --> 00:53:06,377
All right?

768
00:53:08,621 --> 00:53:09,645
All right?

769
00:53:10,556 --> 00:53:12,854
These things happen,
and then they're done.

770
00:53:18,698 --> 00:53:21,189
When you stopped me,
I was going to church.

771
00:53:21,901 --> 00:53:23,994
I've been... unwell.

772
00:53:25,138 --> 00:53:27,106
I confess to you, I've...

773
00:53:29,042 --> 00:53:31,306
been confused, but...

774
00:53:32,345 --> 00:53:34,981
I've learned my lesson,
I'm ready to go home.

775
00:53:34,981 --> 00:53:36,107
Why'd you kill that girl?

776
00:53:38,618 --> 00:53:39,482
What girl?

777
00:53:40,586 --> 00:53:42,110
That girl you killed.

778
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:45,180
- How's everything?
- Fine.

779
00:54:49,489 --> 00:54:51,889
- I'm all right too.
- Oh, good.

780
00:54:54,427 --> 00:54:56,452
You wanna tell me you're
mad at me or something?

781
00:54:56,796 --> 00:54:58,730
Did you kill that
girl in her apartment?

782
00:55:00,733 --> 00:55:01,495
Yes.

783
00:55:02,335 --> 00:55:04,929
But I want to tell you something.
I didn't mean to.

784
00:55:05,171 --> 00:55:08,231
But you wanna hear something
funny? Now, don't laugh.

785
00:55:09,842 --> 00:55:11,810
I think I just had too much coffee.

786
00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:14,978
I'll tell you something else.

787
00:55:15,548 --> 00:55:19,040
There are too many people in the world.
That's why we kill each other.

788
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:25,248
I suppose you're
mad at me for leaving you.

789
00:55:26,225 --> 00:55:29,126
I don't suppose
you're, um, inclined...

790
00:55:30,229 --> 00:55:34,029
or nor do I think you should be
to stand by me.

791
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,327
I understand that.

792
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:41,841
I'm sure there are marriages
where the wife would...

793
00:55:41,841 --> 00:55:44,139
or the husband,
if it would go that way.

794
00:55:44,844 --> 00:55:48,940
But, I know ours is
not one of that type.

795
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,684
I know you wished
at one point it would.

796
00:55:53,453 --> 00:55:55,614
I wished that too, at one point.
I know...

797
00:55:57,490 --> 00:56:01,688
I'm sure this is how you feel
when someone near you dies.

798
00:56:02,228 --> 00:56:05,026
You never said the things
you wanted desperately to say.

799
00:56:05,865 --> 00:56:07,730
It would have been so
simple to say them...

800
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,231
but you never did.

801
00:56:12,839 --> 00:56:15,307
- You got the papers?
- Yes.

802
00:56:15,975 --> 00:56:17,909
- Good.
- Oh, yes, I got them.

803
00:56:21,747 --> 00:56:24,739
- Anything you need?
- Nope.

804
00:56:26,452 --> 00:56:27,851
Can't think of a thing.

805
00:56:38,898 --> 00:56:40,126
You take care now.

806
00:59:36,008 --> 00:59:37,873
You know... you know... you know...

807
00:59:39,712 --> 00:59:43,443
we can't distinguish between anxiety
and fear. You know what I mean?

808
00:59:45,918 --> 00:59:47,510
I don't mean fear. I mean...

809
00:59:49,855 --> 00:59:51,982
I do mean fear.
I don't mean anxiety.

810
00:59:52,692 --> 00:59:56,628
When we fear something
I think we wish for it.

811
00:59:58,664 --> 01:00:00,393
Death. Or burglars.

812
01:00:01,901 --> 01:00:02,868
Don't you think?

813
01:00:08,674 --> 01:00:12,542
I always knew I would end up here.
Every fear hides a wish.

814
01:00:14,747 --> 01:00:16,112
I think I'm gonna like it here.

815
01:00:17,016 --> 01:00:18,347
- You do?
- I do.

816
01:00:18,584 --> 01:00:20,916
You know why? It's simple.
That's why I think I am.

817
01:00:23,823 --> 01:00:26,325
You know, I always thought white
people should be in prison.

818
01:00:26,325 --> 01:00:27,993
I know it's the black
race we keep there...

819
01:00:27,993 --> 01:00:29,862
but I always thought white people
should be there.

820
01:00:29,862 --> 01:00:31,731
- You know why?
- Why?

821
01:00:31,731 --> 01:00:34,859
To be with the black people.
Does that sound too simple to you?

822
01:00:36,068 --> 01:00:36,625
No.

823
01:00:37,103 --> 01:00:38,627
Because we're lonely.

824
01:00:39,271 --> 01:00:43,037
But what I know...
I think all this fear...

825
01:00:44,443 --> 01:00:47,310
all this fucking fear
we feel must hide a wish.

826
01:00:47,747 --> 01:00:50,807
'Cause I don't feel it since
I'm here. I don't.

827
01:00:51,217 --> 01:00:53,276
I think for the
first time in my life.

828
01:00:55,054 --> 01:00:56,489
I think we're like birds.

829
01:00:56,489 --> 01:00:58,991
We suspect when
there's going to be an earthquake.

830
01:00:58,991 --> 01:01:00,959
Birds know. They
leave three days earlier.

831
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,662
Birds leave when there's
gonna be an earthquake?

832
01:01:03,662 --> 01:01:07,700
Yes. And I think,
in our soul, we feel...

833
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,691
we sense there's going to be...

834
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,766
a cataclysm.

835
01:01:17,409 --> 01:01:18,842
But we cannot flee.

836
01:01:19,044 --> 01:01:21,376
Something tells us, "Get outta here!"

837
01:01:22,915 --> 01:01:25,509
White people feel that.
You feel that?

838
01:01:28,187 --> 01:01:31,088
Well... but I don't
feel it since I'm here.

839
01:01:31,357 --> 01:01:33,222
So... so... so...

840
01:01:35,728 --> 01:01:39,687
I must be somewhere safe.
Isn't that funny?

841
01:01:40,299 --> 01:01:41,323
No.

842
01:01:42,168 --> 01:01:44,432
- You think that it's not?
- Yes.

843
01:01:49,575 --> 01:01:52,066
- Thank you.
- That's all right.

844
01:01:55,714 --> 01:01:58,046
- You want a cigarette?
- No, thank you. Not just now.

845
01:01:58,984 --> 01:01:59,882
That's all right.

846
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,381
- Maybe later.
- Sure.

847
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:06,155
- Now you know what?
- What?

848
01:02:07,126 --> 01:02:08,491
I think you just get on my body.

849
01:02:08,961 --> 01:02:11,088
I... yes.

850
01:02:12,631 --> 01:02:13,655
What do you mean?

851
01:02:16,302 --> 01:02:18,600
I think you get on my body. Now.

852
01:02:19,572 --> 01:02:21,140
I don't know what that means.

853
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:24,974
It means you should suck my dick.
Now, don't you wanna do that?

854
01:02:25,878 --> 01:02:26,810
No.

855
01:02:29,014 --> 01:02:32,347
- Well, you just do it anyway.
- You're joking.

856
01:02:34,486 --> 01:02:35,817
Not at all.

857
01:02:37,723 --> 01:02:40,419
- I don't think I could do that.
- Well, you better try.

858
01:02:41,293 --> 01:02:45,525
Or you're gonna die.
Let's just get this out the way.

859
01:02:48,734 --> 01:02:51,237
Seriously, we're
gonna be here a long time.

860
01:02:51,237 --> 01:02:53,068
I don't think we
want to start like this.

861
01:02:53,339 --> 01:02:54,966
I'm not gonna repeat myself.

862
01:02:59,211 --> 01:03:00,269
I'll scream.

863
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:03,740
If you scream,
you'll offend me...

864
01:03:04,483 --> 01:03:06,212
you gonna die.

865
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:10,348
Look at my face. Say I'm foolin'.

866
01:03:11,624 --> 01:03:13,615
I can't. I can't do...

867
01:03:15,261 --> 01:03:18,628
The motherfuck you can't, missy!
Right now, missy!

868
01:03:19,164 --> 01:03:22,292
Right now, Jim,
and you'd best be nice.

869
01:03:40,552 --> 01:03:41,849
You don't have to talk.

870
01:03:42,588 --> 01:03:43,885
I don't want to talk.

871
01:03:57,303 --> 01:03:59,237
Are you accustomed to life in here?

872
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:04,134
- Do you know what happened to me?
- No.

873
01:04:04,677 --> 01:04:05,911
I was sodomized.

874
01:04:05,911 --> 01:04:07,742
- Did you report it?
- Yes.

875
01:04:08,714 --> 01:04:11,046
- What did they say?
- "That happens".

876
01:04:12,818 --> 01:04:15,787
- I'm sorry it happened to you.
- Thank you.

877
01:04:25,397 --> 01:04:26,830
Are you lonely?

878
01:04:30,369 --> 01:04:35,932
Yes. I feel so alone.

879
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:40,401
I'm so... empty.

880
01:04:41,213 --> 01:04:43,204
Maybe you are ready to be filled.

881
01:04:43,749 --> 01:04:47,810
That's bullshit.
It's bullshit. It's pious bullshit.

882
01:04:48,187 --> 01:04:49,518
- Is it?
- Yes!

883
01:04:49,822 --> 01:04:52,992
That you are ready to be filled?
Is it impossible?

884
01:04:52,992 --> 01:04:54,789
Yes. Yes!

885
01:04:58,364 --> 01:04:59,956
I don't know what's impossible.

886
01:05:00,232 --> 01:05:01,665
Nothing's impossible.

887
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:05,237
Nothing is impossible, not to God.
Is that what you're saying?

888
01:05:05,237 --> 01:05:06,205
Yes.

889
01:05:06,205 --> 01:05:07,968
Then you're full of shit!
You understand that?

890
01:05:08,807 --> 01:05:13,710
If nothing is impossible then let
Him let me walk out of here!

891
01:05:14,413 --> 01:05:15,607
And be free!

892
01:05:16,782 --> 01:05:21,387
Let Him cause a new day, in a
perfect land, full of life and air...

893
01:05:21,387 --> 01:05:24,323
where people are kind
to each other!

894
01:05:24,323 --> 01:05:26,125
And there's work to do!

895
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:30,696
Where we grow up
in love and in security.

896
01:05:30,696 --> 01:05:33,358
We're wanted. Let Him do that.
Go on. Let Him do that...

897
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:36,635
you asshole, if nothing
is impossible to God.

898
01:05:36,635 --> 01:05:38,262
I think that must be easy.

899
01:05:38,737 --> 01:05:42,307
Not "Let me fly"
or "If there is a God...

900
01:05:42,307 --> 01:05:44,798
make him to make the sun
come out at night". Go on.

901
01:05:45,411 --> 01:05:46,712
Please.

902
01:05:46,712 --> 01:05:48,509
Please! Please!

903
01:05:49,481 --> 01:05:51,346
I'm begging you! I'm begging you!

904
01:05:52,418 --> 01:05:54,978
If you're so smart, let him do that!
Please! Please!

905
01:05:55,587 --> 01:05:57,089
I'm begging you!

906
01:05:57,089 --> 01:05:59,148
Are you sorry that you
killed that girl?

907
01:06:03,228 --> 01:06:04,661
- Edmond?
- Yes.

908
01:06:10,569 --> 01:06:12,901
Are you sorry that you
killed that girl?

909
01:06:13,238 --> 01:06:14,967
I'm sorry about everything.

910
01:06:15,741 --> 01:06:19,768
- But are you sorry that you killed?
- Yes.

911
01:06:22,314 --> 01:06:24,839
Yes, I am. Yes.

912
01:06:27,152 --> 01:06:28,915
Why did you kill that girl?

913
01:06:30,989 --> 01:06:32,923
I... don't...

914
01:06:34,193 --> 01:06:36,525
I don't...

915
01:06:42,935 --> 01:06:44,266
I don't think...

916
01:06:45,537 --> 01:06:46,765
I don't...

917
01:06:50,375 --> 01:06:51,433
I don't...

918
01:07:07,726 --> 01:07:09,057
"Dear Mrs. Brown.

919
01:07:09,628 --> 01:07:12,426
You don't remember me.
Perhaps you do.

920
01:07:13,565 --> 01:07:16,295
Do you remember Eddie Burke,
who lived on Euclid?

921
01:07:17,002 --> 01:07:18,196
Maybe you do.

922
01:07:19,037 --> 01:07:20,698
I took Debbie to the prom.

923
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,876
I know that she never
found me attractive...

924
01:07:23,876 --> 01:07:28,247
and I think she was coerced
in some way to go with me...

925
01:07:28,247 --> 01:07:30,215
though I can't think in what way.

926
01:07:31,884 --> 01:07:34,219
It also strikes me as I write...

927
01:07:34,219 --> 01:07:36,517
that maybe she went
of her own free will...

928
01:07:37,422 --> 01:07:40,687
and I found it important to think
that she went unwillingly.

929
01:07:46,131 --> 01:07:50,397
I don't think this is true.
She was a lovely girl...

930
01:07:51,537 --> 01:07:55,073
and I'm sure if you remember me...

931
01:07:55,073 --> 01:07:57,007
you will recall how
taken I was with her then."

932
01:07:58,377 --> 01:07:59,401
You have a visitor.

933
01:08:06,251 --> 01:08:07,513
You have a visitor.

934
01:08:09,221 --> 01:08:10,813
Please tell him I'm ill.

935
01:08:36,215 --> 01:08:38,547
You can't control
what you make of your life.

936
01:08:39,818 --> 01:08:41,217
Now, that's for damn sure.

937
01:08:42,487 --> 01:08:44,580
There's a destiny that
shapes our ends.

938
01:08:46,058 --> 01:08:49,425
- Rough hew them how we may.
- However the motherfuck we may.

939
01:08:50,229 --> 01:08:52,629
- And that's the truth.
- You know that is the truth.

940
01:08:52,831 --> 01:08:57,200
And people say it's hereditary
or it's environment but it's not.

941
01:08:57,869 --> 01:08:58,837
What do you think it is?

942
01:08:58,837 --> 01:09:00,405
I think it's something beyond that.

943
01:09:00,405 --> 01:09:03,141
Beyond these things
that we can know.

944
01:09:03,141 --> 01:09:07,271
I think maybe in dreams we see
what it is. What do you think?

945
01:09:07,613 --> 01:09:09,080
I don't know.

946
01:09:09,681 --> 01:09:13,208
I don't think we can know.
I think if we knew it, we'd be dead.

947
01:09:13,485 --> 01:09:14,620
We'd be God.

948
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:16,485
We would be God.
That is absolutely right.

949
01:09:16,722 --> 01:09:18,257
Or some genius.

950
01:09:18,257 --> 01:09:20,926
No. I don't think even
genius can know what it is.

951
01:09:20,926 --> 01:09:24,162
No, some great genius.
Or some philosopher.

952
01:09:24,162 --> 01:09:26,531
I don't think even
genius can see what we are.

953
01:09:26,531 --> 01:09:27,733
You don't think that...

954
01:09:27,733 --> 01:09:29,166
I think that we can't perceive it.

955
01:09:30,502 --> 01:09:32,504
Well, something's goin' on,
I'll tell you that.

956
01:09:32,504 --> 01:09:34,870
And somewhere, some poor
sucker knows what's happenin'.

957
01:09:35,107 --> 01:09:36,631
- Do you think?
- Shit, yeah.

958
01:09:36,875 --> 01:09:40,538
Some whacked-out sucker
somewhere in the Ozarks.

959
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:42,010
Shit, yes.

960
01:09:42,648 --> 01:09:43,706
Some guy.

961
01:09:44,983 --> 01:09:47,679
Some inbred sucker
walks around all day, just...

962
01:09:48,086 --> 01:09:50,247
- You think?
- Yeah.

963
01:09:50,555 --> 01:09:54,389
Well, maybe not him,
but somewhere, some guy.

964
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:58,486
Some fuck locked up
has got time for reflection.

965
01:10:00,265 --> 01:10:03,735
Or some fuckin'... I don't know...
some kid who's just been born.

966
01:10:03,735 --> 01:10:05,837
Some kid that's just been born.

967
01:10:05,837 --> 01:10:07,773
- He's got no preconceptions.
- Yes.

968
01:10:07,773 --> 01:10:09,468
- All he's...
- Yes, absolutely right.

969
01:10:09,708 --> 01:10:12,006
Yes. Maybe it's memory.

970
01:10:12,577 --> 01:10:15,205
- That's what I'm sayin'. Maybe...
- It could be.

971
01:10:15,447 --> 01:10:18,617
Or some knowledge.
Some intuition.

972
01:10:18,617 --> 01:10:21,320
I don't even mean intuition.
Something... something...

973
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,655
- Or maybe some animal.
- Why not?

974
01:10:23,655 --> 01:10:27,259
The whole time when they say
"We'll wait for the men from space."

975
01:10:27,259 --> 01:10:29,194
- Maybe they're already here.
- Maybe they are.

976
01:10:29,194 --> 01:10:30,529
- Maybe they're animals...
- Yes.

977
01:10:30,529 --> 01:10:32,429
...that were left here.
- Eons ago.

978
01:10:32,798 --> 01:10:34,891
- Long ago.
- And have been bred here.

979
01:10:36,568 --> 01:10:38,263
Or maybe we're the animals.

980
01:10:43,542 --> 01:10:44,634
Maybe we are.

981
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:52,484
You know how they...
they are supreme on their...

982
01:10:52,484 --> 01:10:54,611
on their native world.

983
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:57,084
- But when you put them here...
- We call them dogs.

984
01:10:57,489 --> 01:11:00,151
Or animals. And we scorn them.

985
01:11:00,692 --> 01:11:02,990
We scorn them in our fear.

986
01:11:03,395 --> 01:11:05,625
- But don't you think...
- It very well could be.

987
01:11:07,232 --> 01:11:10,535
But on their native world
they are supreme.

988
01:11:10,535 --> 01:11:11,770
I think that's very...

989
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:14,773
And what we have done is
to disgrace ourselves.

990
01:11:14,773 --> 01:11:15,841
We have.

991
01:11:15,841 --> 01:11:17,934
Because we did not treat
them with respect.

992
01:11:23,949 --> 01:11:26,918
- Maybe we were the animals.
- That's what I'm saying.

993
01:11:28,653 --> 01:11:34,285
Maybe they're here to watch over us.
Maybe that's why they're here.

994
01:11:35,227 --> 01:11:37,218
Or to observe us.

995
01:11:39,064 --> 01:11:41,032
Maybe we're here to be punished.

996
01:11:47,506 --> 01:11:48,996
You think there's a hell?

997
01:11:51,042 --> 01:11:52,373
I don't know.

998
01:11:53,512 --> 01:11:54,809
I don't know.

999
01:11:56,648 --> 01:11:58,115
You think we're there?

1000
01:11:59,151 --> 01:12:00,880
I don't know, man.

1001
01:12:02,788 --> 01:12:05,657
Think we go somewhere when we die?

1002
01:12:05,657 --> 01:12:09,753
I don't know, man.
I like to think so.

1003
01:12:11,129 --> 01:12:12,426
I do too.

1004
01:12:12,664 --> 01:12:14,757
I sure do like to think so.

1005
01:12:17,369 --> 01:12:19,030
Perhaps it's heaven.

1006
01:12:21,006 --> 01:12:22,132
I don't know, man.

1007
01:12:23,708 --> 01:12:26,768
I don't know either.
But perhaps it is.

1008
01:12:28,413 --> 01:12:30,210
