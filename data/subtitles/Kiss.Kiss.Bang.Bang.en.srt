1
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:42,292
On the count of three.

2
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:46,204
One, two, three!

3
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:50,801
Try the ring toss. Three for a quarter.
Look how easy it is.

4
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:53,262
There you go, a winner!

5
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:57,182
And now, for my shocking finale.

6
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,725
Not for the squeamish.

7
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,222
Not for the faint of heart.

8
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:08,269
I call my trick "The Jaws of Death."

9
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,656
Now. Say it. Say it.

10
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:16,450
Harold, use your awesome might
to save me from this hopeless plight.

11
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,155
No harm will come to you.
Alakazam!

12
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,414
Help me! Help me!

13
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,929
I'm going to be an actress.

14
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:36,858
<i>It's hard to believe it was
just last Christmas...</i>

15
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:38,843
<i>that me and Harmony
changed the world.</i>

16
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:42,805
<i>And we didn't mean to.
And it didn't last long, you know.</i>

17
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:44,307
<i>A thing like that can't.</i>

18
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,956
<i>Now that I'm in L.A.,
I go to parties.</i>

19
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:48,311
<i>The kind where
if a girl is named Jill...</i>

20
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,973
<i>she spells it J-Y-L-L-E, that bullshit.</i>

21
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:55,860
<i>That's me there. My name's
Harry Lockhart, I'll be your narrator.</i>

22
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,403
<i>Welcome to L.A.</i>

23
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:58,939
<i>Welcome to the party.</i>

24
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:16,173
<i>The guy smoking, that's Dabney Shaw,
my producer. He discovered me.</i>

25
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:20,509
<i>The man with him is Perry Van Shrike,
a.k.a. Gay Perry.</i>

26
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:24,264
<i>Honest-to-God private eye,
consults in film, TV. Just incorporated.</i>

27
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,850
<i>He's bigtime. Also, he's gay.</i>

28
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,350
Don't start, Perry, huh?

29
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,521
I seen you play ball. You're tough.
But you see a naked guy...

30
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,355
your brain says, "I want that."

31
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,901
I don't make that leap. It's like,
"Look, there's an elephant. Quick..."

32
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:39,904
"let's drain its blood
to paint my boathouse."

33
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:43,033
It's just that that's not
the first thing you think of.

34
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,867
<i>L.A.</i>

35
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:47,995
<i>By now you may wonder
how I wound up here, or maybe not.</i>

36
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:51,249
<i>Maybe you wonder how Silly Putty
picks shit up from comic books.</i>

37
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,461
<i>Point is, I don't see another
goddamn narrator, so pipe down.</i>

38
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,497
<i>How did I get here? See for yourself.</i>

39
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,098
Chloe, just run the name by me
one more time...

40
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,184
because I must be missing something.

41
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:12,062
I'm going nuts.
I've been through the store three times.

42
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,980
<i>Cyber Agent. C-Y-B-E...
Why don't you ask...</i>

43
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,851
<i>- An employee or something?</i>
- No no, they're all busy.

44
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:23,281
"Protocop, protector of man."
Is that it? Protocop? He protects men.

45
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,617
<i>Uncle Harry, look around.
There are signs.</i>

46
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:31,622
<i>That show was cancelled two years ago.
Just ask... Wait, are they even open?</i>

47
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:34,668
Yeah, it's holiday hours. Look...
Get away from the window.

48
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,288
I gotta go, but I'll find this.

49
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:41,088
Great.

50
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,716
Shit, Harry, that shit went wrong, man!

51
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,886
- Give me the gun!
- No. Give me the bullets!

52
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,848
Freeze!

53
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,863
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

54
00:05:48,865 --> 00:05:51,350
We'll stand right here
and wait for the police.

55
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:55,062
Drop the gun. We didn't do anything.
We are not dangerous. Drop the gun.

56
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:58,183
- Hey, lady, gun is not loaded...
- Ritchie, no!

57
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,310
Richie!

58
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,228
Shit!

59
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,194
Oh, boy.

60
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,790
Take it easy.

61
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:26,093
Jesus. Oh, no, no.
We're not ready for you yet, sir.

62
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:29,389
- Go wait with the others.
- Grace, do me a favor, let's take him.

63
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,141
- He's ready. You're ready?
- Ready?

64
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,718
Okay, come on.

65
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,562
You know the setup?
Got any questions?

66
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,105
He's got no questions.
Look at him. Let's go.

67
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,641
Let's read.

68
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:45,613
- Where is he? Where's Raphael?
- Where is he?

69
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:47,149
Where's...?

70
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,283
Beat up on me all night. You want me
to give up my partner, you can go spit.

71
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,081
Quit acting like the good guy,
jerk-off.

72
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,874
You got your partner killed.

73
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:07,093
He was in over his head,
you knew it.

74
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,428
You may as well
have pulled the trigger.

75
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,173
You killed him!

76
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:18,055
No, I didn't... I didn't kill him.
He wanted in.

77
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,850
Why...?

78
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,317
Why!

79
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:25,778
I didn't want him to come in on it.
He insisted.

80
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,120
I said, "Stay at home."
But he doesn't listen.

81
00:07:28,122 --> 00:07:30,901
He's such a stupid son of a bitch.

82
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,911
I killed him, didn't I?

83
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:37,074
Oh, fuck, this is my fault. I'm sorry.

84
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,124
Sorry.

85
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,586
Hey, good luck.

86
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,680
See, this is what I'm talking about.
Old school. Method.

87
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:53,466
Studio.

88
00:07:53,468 --> 00:07:55,382
Brando. Put this in the pouch to L.A.

89
00:07:55,384 --> 00:07:57,101
Get Gay Perry on the phone.

90
00:07:57,103 --> 00:08:00,471
<i>Now, get this, they're
screen-testing me. Is that wild?</i>

91
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,608
<i>One minute, I'm boosting Xboxes
in the East Village...</i>

92
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,069
<i>the next,
I'm sipping champagne in L.A.</i>

93
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,071
- Hi.
- Hey.

94
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:09,956
So, what do you do for a living?

95
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:13,843
I'm retired.
I invented dice, when I was a kid.

96
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,276
How about you?

97
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:17,389
I do a little acting.

98
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,418
I'm gonna see who else is here.

99
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,829
<i>Anyway, that's how I got to the party.</i>

100
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,925
<i>Now, Harmony, different story.</i>

101
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:32,261
<i>Some will tell you she got here
on account of the giant robot.</i>

102
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:33,929
<i>I'll show you that in a minute.</i>

103
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:37,225
<i>But for me, robot-schmobot,
she was destined to be here.</i>

104
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,184
<i>Jeez, look at those stems, will you?</i>

105
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:42,438
<i>Not that that's what constitutes
why she should be here.</i>

106
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,399
Yes, racist. I'm serious.

107
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,110
The other reindeer laughed at him.
Then, out of the blue, they need him.

108
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,238
He's as good as a fog light
or whatever.

109
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:53,658
You know what, so you tell me,
how is it any different than:

110
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,036
"Don't talk to Reggie, he's black.

111
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:59,748
Oh, wait, he can play basketball.
Sign him up."

112
00:08:59,749 --> 00:09:02,326
Rudolph, Reggie.

113
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:07,004
<i>Harmony Faith Lane was your typical
L.A. girl, she wasn't from there.</i>

114
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,298
<i>She grew up in a burg
in southern Indiana.</i>

115
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,802
<i>"When in doubt, cut up a pig."
That was the town motto.</i>

116
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:17,014
<i>Like most soon-to-be-fucked-up girls,
Harmony was wicked smart.</i>

117
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,058
<i>Of course, credit where credit's due...</i>

118
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,811
<i>she had a terrific mentor.
No, not her.</i>

119
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,054
<i>Him.</i>

120
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,274
"'Go to hell, Jonny Gossamer!"

121
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,277
"She poured herself
into a seamless dress."

122
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,988
"From the looks of it,
she spilled some."

123
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,532
<i>Jonny spoke from the pages
of cheap paperbacks...</i>

124
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,869
<i>and told of a promised land
known as "the Coast"...</i>

125
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:42,164
<i>and a magical city
called Los Angeles.</i>

126
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:45,918
<i>As the years progressed,
she wished he was real.</i>

127
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,749
<i>Wished that he would come to Indiana
to save her little sister, Jenna.</i>

128
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:55,586
<i>You see, Papa was at her
night after night.</i>

129
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,548
<i>But Jonny never showed.</i>

130
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,850
<i>And then the guy
writing the books died.</i>

131
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,726
<i>Age 16, she split.</i>

132
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,813
<i>Took the bus to L.A.,
the promised land.</i>

133
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:08,691
<i>She'd get rich and famous
and then help little sis.</i>

134
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:10,192
<i>Before he died...</i>

135
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,903
<i>the guy who wrote the books
said Jonny was a joke.</i>

136
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,072
<i>He wrote it for money,
and it was bullshit.</i>

137
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:18,610
<i>Harmony ignored this. She knew better.
I mean, who the hell was he?</i>

138
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,577
<i>He was just a writer.</i>

139
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,288
<i>And that's how she got
to the same party as me...</i>

140
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,082
<i>Oh, shit. I skipped something.</i>

141
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,086
<i>Damn it. This robot bit.
I made a big deal, then I forgot.</i>

142
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,838
<i>Fuck, bad narrating.
Like my dad telling a joke.</i>

143
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,926
<i>"Oh, wait, back up. I forgot to tell you
the cowboy rode a blue horse." Fuck.</i>

144
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:38,763
<i>I don't know if you want to see it now,
but here's the fucking robot stuff.</i>

145
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,264
<i>Can I say "fuck" more?</i>

146
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:43,009
<i>Now back to Protocop,
starring Jeff Neal.</i>

147
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,370
What the...?

148
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:15,208
Oh, my God.

149
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,836
Hey!

150
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:28,395
<i>Sources close to Neal, who has not
worked as an actor in two years...</i>

151
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:30,731
<i>say he seemed despondent
earlier tonight...</i>

152
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,900
<i>during a rerun of Protocop.</i>

153
00:11:32,902 --> 00:11:36,028
<i>The actor, who still retains a costume
he wore on the show...</i>

154
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,654
<i>allegedly dressed up...</i>

155
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,783
<i>stumbled down the bike path and
wandered into this Venice Beach house...</i>

156
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:46,581
<i>where aspiring actress Harmony Faith
Lane was shocked to discover him.</i>

157
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:50,043
<i>I'd jog by, "Hi, hello," you know,
that sort of thing.</i>

158
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,753
- Who's this?
<i>- I feel for the guy.</i>

159
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:54,297
<i>This city can't get enough
of messing with people.</i>

160
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:57,759
<i>Like putting a whoopee cushion
on the seat of an electric chair.</i>

161
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,844
<i>- Like that.</i>
- They always do this.

162
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:03,889
You can never see below the waist.
It's like a Playmate in 1964.

163
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,268
It was always behind the bedpost
or there's a shadow. You never...

164
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:10,179
What the fuck am I telling you for?
Invite her to something.

165
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:13,142
<i>And there it was. Bingo.</i>

166
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,352
<i>Destiny.</i>

167
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,503
You know what,
you better be her doctor.

168
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,971
Walk away. Don't think, just do it.

169
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:29,009
What, are you her brother or something?
It's none of your business, man.

170
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:33,395
- I will fuck you up.
- No, you'll try.

171
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:36,356
And that little experiment
will end in tears, my friend.

172
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:40,610
So again, for the cheap seats,
do not think, walk the fuck away.

173
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,904
Or let's you and me
go outside right now.

174
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,490
It's past my bedtime.

175
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,735
Make a choice.

176
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:05,546
Asshole.

177
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,217
You all right?

178
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,803
Yeah.

179
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:15,605
Thanks, bro.

180
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:18,106
One day,
I'll actually learn how to fight.

181
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,644
- Perry Van Shrike.
- Hey. Harry Lockhart.

182
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:25,865
I heard about you. You're
the whatchamacallit, the consultant.

183
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,369
- You must be... Anyway...
- Gay Perry?

184
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,580
Yeah. Right.
Dabney calls you that.

185
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:35,124
- I guess you guys are old buddies.
- Five years.

186
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,460
Wow, five years.

187
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,086
- Still gay?
- Me? No.

188
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:44,084
I'm knee-deep in pussy. I just like the
name so much, I can't get rid of it.

189
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:49,213
You should know better than to fall
asleep at a party. There's freaks here.

190
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:53,643
Dabney wants you
to take detective lessons.

191
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:56,437
- Come again?
- For your acting.

192
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,523
I've got surveillance tomorrow.
You game?

193
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:00,441
What's the person like? Crime lord?

194
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:03,693
Please. I'm guessing some sad,
lonely little man...

195
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:07,030
who single-handedly haunts his own
home in the Hollywood Hills.

196
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,533
That was incredibly gay.

197
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,953
- Good God. Ouch.
- Yeah, you should see the other guy.

198
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:16,374
Harry, this is our generous host,
Harlan Dexter.

199
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:21,044
Ah, yes, of course. You're Dabney's
golden boy from back East.

200
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,963
I hope it isn't past your bedtime.

201
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:25,549
No, sir. My mom used to say
I had the neon disease.

202
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,717
When the neon lights came on,
I woke up.

203
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,644
I'm afraid I'm
similarly afflicted.

204
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:32,056
My daughter just lived
10 years in Paris.

205
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:35,844
She says it is heaven
for the vampire set.

206
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:42,100
If you'll excuse me, apparently I'm
meant to help out this monstrosity.

207
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,653
Mom's gone, so it's just him
and his born-again little bundle of joy.

208
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,865
- Born-again? That's precious.
- Isn't it?

209
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,741
Three months ago, she was suing him
over Mom's millions.

210
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,986
He called her a... Well, a bad word.

211
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:59,000
Cunt. Welcome to Hollywood.

212
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,878
<i>Okay, I apologize.</i>

213
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:05,548
<i>That is a terrible scene.
It's like, "Why was that in the movie?"</i>

214
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,134
<i>"Gee," you think,
"maybe it'll come back later, maybe?"</i>

215
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,261
<i>I hate that. A TV's on,
talking about the new power plant.</i>

216
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,181
<i>Wonder where the climax will happen.</i>

217
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:17,268
<i>Or that shot of the cook in
Hunt tor Red October. Sorry.</i>

218
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:19,895
Hi, thank you for coming.

219
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:22,981
Hey, do you know that blond gal
who just left?

220
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,735
Oh, the one with the guy
that beat the shit out of you? No.

221
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,696
Bye, have a better night.

222
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:31,115
She had something, that gal,
this quality.

223
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,908
Like the girl from high school...

224
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:36,412
the one that got away. You know
what I mean? That haunts you still.

225
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,538
- Yeah, I had that.
- You did?

226
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,991
Bobby Mills.

227
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:45,046
Well, maybe you should
try to get in touch.

228
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:47,506
I got 5 bucks says
you could still get him.

229
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:50,967
Really? That's funny.
I got a 10 says, "Pass the pepper."

230
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,988
I got two quarters singing harmony on
"Moonlight in Vermont."

231
00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:56,097
- What?
- Talking money.

232
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,433
- A talking monkey?
- Talking monkey, yeah.

233
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,971
Came here from the future.
Ugly sucker. Only says, "Ficus."

234
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,106
Detective lessons tomorrow.

235
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,651
- Don't forget.
- Okay.

236
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:08,152
And Harry...

237
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:10,070
Come here.

238
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,691
That girl, I know her.
She's done some work for me.

239
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,492
Try the Domino Room.

240
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,362
Where's that?

241
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:37,390
- Hey there. I'm Flicka.
- Hey.

242
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:40,509
- How are you?
- Good. So, what do you do?

243
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:45,522
- I'm a private detective. And you?
- I'm a stewardess.

244
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,482
- Really?
- Yeah.

245
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,818
- Well, nice to meet you.
- That it?

246
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,146
- Yeah.
- Yep.

247
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:02,115
Could I have a Jack and soda? Thanks.

248
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:05,160
Evening. Harry.

249
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,546
God, I'm sore.

250
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:13,000
I mean, physically, not like a guy
who's angry in a movie in the 1950s.

251
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:20,432
- Didn't I see you at a party hours ago?
- Why?

252
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,226
- Why what?
- Why me?

253
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:27,230
Seriously, why not the girl over there?
Look, she's very pretty.

254
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,732
Which one?

255
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,277
On the left,
next to Brazilian Billy Bob Thornton.

256
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:33,528
Oh, that's a bit of a reach.

257
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,240
I'm interrupting. I feel badly.
What are you drinking?

258
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,035
- Bad.
- Bad? Sorry?

259
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:40,869
- You feel bad.
- Bad?

260
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:44,414
"Badly" is an adverb. To say you
feel badly says that the mechanism...

261
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:49,295
which allows you to feel is broken.
- Well, that one over there?

262
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,330
Between... Oh, God, nix, nix. That's...

263
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,884
- The blond. The blond's pathetic.
- Because?

264
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:59,763
For starters, she's been fucked
more times than she's had hot meals.

265
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:02,724
I heard. It was neck and neck,
and then she skipped lunch.

266
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,559
- Worst thing, though...
- Do tell.

267
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,721
Worst thing is she's 35 years old
and still trying to act.

268
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,724
I see her at auditions all the time.

269
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:14,028
- It's over, baby. You missed.
- That's charitable of you.

270
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,771
May I ask how old you are?

271
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:18,449
- Go for it.
- Okay, how old are you?

272
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,991
- Thirty-four.
- Yeah?

273
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,828
- I'm a baby.
- Where's your buddy? The guy you...

274
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,333
- The guy you left the party with?
- He's a fucking asshole.

275
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,542
I just needed a ride.
Sorry, I swear a lot.

276
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,711
- I know. It's okay.
- Did you know the host?

277
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,214
- No.
- He looked familiar, though.

278
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,375
Probably an actor.

279
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,628
Go away, Mr. Fly.

280
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:44,141
- I was talking to your friend.
- She doesn't want to talk to you.

281
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:46,810
Sunshine, she'll be back to you
in a minute. Relax.

282
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,888
She doesn't have a minute.

283
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:54,818
Tell you what, if you change your mind
about that drink...

284
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:58,315
I'll be over there
with Native American Joe Pesci.

285
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,952
- You are so...
- That was good, right?

286
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,954
Why are you humoring him? Stop it.

287
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,958
You know what,
there's an empty table over there.

288
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:12,127
I hear it's a recommended
cheeseball hangout.

289
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,672
Your mouth is a recommended place
to put a sock.

290
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:17,459
Princess. Scary friend.

291
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,844
Goddamn it.

292
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:24,140
Harry Lockhart, are you gonna
recognize me or what?

293
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:26,593
God! Embrey, Indiana!

294
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:31,347
Loves snakes, afraid of spiders.

295
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:36,026
Come on, remember?
You were Amazing Harry...

296
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:38,695
- No, no, no. Harold the Great.
- Harmony?

297
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:40,239
You cut me in half, remember?

298
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,367
Oh, shit. Oh, my God. How are you?

299
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,703
<i>Okay, I was a bad narrator again...</i>

300
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,999
<i>because the kid at the beginning,
the magician, that was me.</i>

301
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,916
<i>I don't want to put this on you...</i>

302
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,045
<i>but if you've been paying attention,
I shouldn't have to...</i>

303
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,589
<i>Great. No wonder. Ma and Pa Kettle.
I got an idea.</i>

304
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,426
<i>Why not put these two lame-o extras
in front of the mammoth fucking lens?</i>

305
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,679
<i>Boo. Scat. Fat lady, leave.</i>

306
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,140
<i>See there? "Harold."</i>

307
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:08,933
<i>Remember how I said
this high school chick haunted me'?</i>

308
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,144
<i>How seeing Harmony made me
think of her?</i>

309
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,847
<i>That's because it was her.
It all came flooding back.</i>

310
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,434
<i>How I was the one she confided in.</i>

311
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,561
<i>While she was doing every other guy.</i>

312
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,491
<i>It was the first time I felt
that how pitying someone...</i>

313
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:27,787
<i>and wanting to fuck them
can get all tangled up in your head.</i>

314
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:30,372
<i>Overwhelming sadness.
Meanwhile, you got a Rodney.</i>

315
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:34,493
<i>Is that sick? I think...
Yeah, I think that's sick.</i>

316
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:40,375
Leaving my sister back home,
leaving her there all alone...

317
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:45,046
Hardest thing I ever did.

318
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:51,727
Do you remember
when we were real little...

319
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:55,021
and a movie crew came to town?

320
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:58,150
That mystery flick with the guy,
Jonny what's-his-name?

321
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,193
- Gossamer.
- Jonny Gossamer. Right.

322
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:03,565
Your mom went nuts,
and she bought all the books and stuff.

323
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:08,111
- That was... God, that was forever ago.
- Yeah, that was back in the day.

324
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:10,904
Harry...

325
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:14,200
I didn't get famous.

326
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:17,996
Yet.

327
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,967
I did...

328
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:25,051
get to do this one commercial.

329
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:27,596
You're shitting me. Which one?

330
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,266
Well, you know the one with the bear?

331
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:33,810
And it goes... Well, this is funny.

332
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:36,896
- "I prefer Genaros, but..."
- "But I'm a bear, what do I know?

333
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,898
"I suck heads off fish." That was you?

334
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,902
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, it was. Yeah.

335
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,778
- That's awesome.
- Commercial.

336
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,447
Come on, that's a big deal.

337
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,700
- That's a national commercial.
- Harry, stop.

338
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:51,578
It's nothing. There was actually this
kind of cool moment where I got...

339
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,781
to sort of do the wave.

340
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,167
"I prefer Genaros."

341
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,628
- Whatever, it's nothing.
- It's pretty cool.

342
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,665
- It's nothing special at all.
- Well, I think it's special.

343
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:07,176
Punk-rock Steven Seagal
thinks it's special.

344
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:09,930
Right there, at your 11 o'clock.

345
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:11,598
That's dead-on, right?

346
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,594
That's all right.
I had him pegged when I came in.

347
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,365
Come back to the hotel
for a little while,

348
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:19,440
just have one drink.
Bring your friend.

349
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:20,537
It'd just be a drink.

350
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:23,568
You'll be home faster than
you can say "Jack Robinson."

351
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,980
I don't know about that. I can say...

352
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:30,943
- "Jack Robinson" pretty fast.
- I'm timing you.

353
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,489
Jack Robinson.

354
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:05,818
- Do you have any idea what time it is?
- I'm really sorry.

355
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,696
God, you still look great.
You're just stunning I like...

356
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:10,657
- Why are you here?
- Good question.

357
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:13,242
Sounds crazy, but I don't remember
what occurred...

358
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,412
between the hours of 2 and 5,
a blur.

359
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:17,664
- Really? Where's Marleah?
- Marleah?

360
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:20,541
- The girl you...
- Marleah fell asleep at my place...

361
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,211
and I didn't see you leave...

362
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,755
I left when you had your tongue
down her throat.

363
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:26,256
- I did?
- Yeah.

364
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:28,800
God. No, wrong throat, wrong woman.
That's bad.

365
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,220
Yeah, that's bad.
You got 10 seconds, Harry.

366
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:33,388
Oh, boy, pressure, pressure.
I came here...

367
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,057
because I think
you're intelligent and attractive...

368
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:39,686
That's plenty. Stop. Oh, my God!
I can't believe you'd come here...

369
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:42,564
to tell me you like me
after you fucked my friend!

370
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:45,192
That's just it, I didn't.
I believe that I did not.

371
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,068
What? You said you don't remember!

372
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:50,655
If I don't remember because I was drunk,
how could I have gotten it up?

373
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,825
I know this is outrageous
and not normal.

374
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:56,904
I'm not pretending that I'm normal.
I just chickened out...

375
00:24:57,163 --> 00:25:01,159
Moron. Why? Why? Why?

376
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:34,199
And the plots, they all have this thing,
this formula that was so cool.

377
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,660
Seriously, I would go through one
in a day.

378
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:40,372
- A whole book in one day. Wow.
- See, Gossamer would always take on...

379
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,708
two cases
that were seemingly unrelated.

380
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:45,210
One's normal
and the other's some wild shit...

381
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,628
then you'd find out
that they're connected.

382
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,798
That it's all one case.

383
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,424
That's the essence of the...

384
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:56,047
Yeah, I get that all the time. Would
you mind not rooting around in there?

385
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:58,307
It's tiny. Is this real?

386
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:01,678
Yeah, it's a derringer. It's loaded.

387
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:05,355
- I call it my faggot gun.
- Because?

388
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:09,644
It's only good for a couple shots, then
you gotta drop it for something better.

389
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,896
You asked, chief.

390
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:16,401
On with our lesson.

391
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:20,133
My client is one Allison Ames.
A-M-E-S.

392
00:26:20,134 --> 00:26:21,371
Ames.

393
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:24,750
Female. She hired me
to do some video surveillance.

394
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,501
- Is she a looker?
- Oh, man.

395
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:29,998
She opens the door,
she got nothing on but the radio.

396
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,508
Invites me to sit down,
sits on my lap...

397
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:35,009
fires up a smoke.
- Really?

398
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,679
No. Idiot.

399
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,807
She hired me over the phone.

400
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:43,018
- Paid for it with a credit card.
- Okay.

401
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:48,731
Rule number one:
This business, real life, it's boring.

402
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,276
- Do you have to smoke?
- You want me to put it out?

403
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:55,614
Yeah, soon as you find a large, brown
clump of shrubs, just throw it in there.

404
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:59,576
So you knew Harmony in high school.
You said she dissed you.

405
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,162
No, not really.
She fucked every other guy but me.

406
00:27:02,163 --> 00:27:04,539
No, that's not true.
She made one concession.

407
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,209
She agreed not to fuck my best friend,
Chook Chutney.

408
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,670
He was my best friend,
so she gave me that.

409
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:11,059
Well, that was nice of her.

410
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,589
Even if he asked, she
said she wouldn't.

411
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,634
Stay put. Be quiet.

412
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,839
"Chock Chutney"? Yeah, he's gay.

413
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:39,901
- What's wrong with his car?
- Do I look like a mechanic?

414
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:44,538
- Are we gonna follow him?
- Where'd he go?

415
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:48,241
He was right in front of us,
then he cut in... Where is he?

416
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,500
What the hell. He's gotta be somewhere.
He turned right in front of us.

417
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,848
- Jesus!
- Shit!

418
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,517
Harry, come back.

419
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,059
Harry.

420
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,105
- There's no one in the car. Harry.
- What?

421
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,432
Harry, stop.

422
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,402
- I think it's going down.
- Wait, the sound.

423
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:17,695
- Check the back seat.
- No, get the keys!

424
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,107
The keys! Get the keys!

425
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:26,864
Perry.

426
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,701
Perry?

427
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:33,663
Shit.

428
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:39,042
Perry!

429
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:44,513
Where'd she come from?

430
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:48,143
She was in the trunk.
I had to shoot the lock to get it open.

431
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:49,679
Oh, Jesus.

432
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,266
God, what did they do to her face?

433
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:55,893
Is she dead?

434
00:28:55,894 --> 00:28:58,903
No. She's resting her
eyes for a minute.

435
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,398
Of course she's fucking dead.
Her neck's broken.

436
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,623
- Hey, what the hell's going on?
- Shut up.

437
00:29:18,508 --> 00:29:21,050
- Hey, we got a dead girl here!
- Hey, shut up.

438
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:23,679
Two guys in masks,
and there they go.

439
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,721
What the fuck is going on?
This is bad.

440
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,766
We gotta roll before the cops come.

441
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:30,894
- Nix. We go right to the cops.
- Exactly, to the cops...

442
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:34,730
who'll believe that she broke her neck
before you shot her in the head.

443
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,316
What?

444
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:38,777
- Come on, we gotta go.
- Oh, God.

445
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:41,404
- We gotta go. Go, go, go.
- Oh, God.

446
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:43,323
Oh, God.

447
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:46,410
- All right, we're out of here.
- We gotta go, go, go.

448
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:47,911
Where's my gun?

449
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:49,913
- No, I...
- Give me my gun.

450
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,580
- I got rid of it.
- Say again.

451
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:53,834
Threw it in the lake.
You wouldn't, I would.

452
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:56,670
I got priors in New York,
so I can't be messing around...

453
00:29:56,671 --> 00:29:58,630
- You threw it away?
- It's evidence.

454
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:01,133
- Watch it. Relax.
- Okay, okay. No, I'm sorry.

455
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:04,377
- I got a little nonplussed there.
- This is crazy. I understand.

456
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,263
- What is that? Is that a clue?
- What do you mean?

457
00:30:07,265 --> 00:30:08,965
- Do you see that?
- In the thing?

458
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,143
What were you thinking?

459
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:14,438
My $2000 ceramic Vektor
my mother got me as a special gift...

460
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:17,941
you threw next to the car.
What happens when they drag the lake?

461
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,776
You think they'll find my pistol?

462
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:21,961
Jesus. Look up "idiot"
in the dictionary.

463
00:30:21,961 --> 00:30:23,529
You know what you'll find?

464
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,281
- A picture of me?
- No...

465
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:28,944
the definition of the word "idiot,"
which you fucking are.

466
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:32,705
Bitch client.

467
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:35,041
Hires me, has me witness a murder.

468
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,765
Can I use a dry towel?
This towel's wet.

469
00:30:36,766 --> 00:30:37,501
No.

470
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,921
- This towel is wet.
- The towel is for the seat.

471
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:42,883
This was for your shoes.
You handed it to me for my face?

472
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:45,469
- This is wet. Can I use a dry...?
- It's dirty. No.

473
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,381
- Can I...?
- No. Stop dripping.

474
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:51,717
Shit better be improving your acting.

475
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:05,404
- Get out.
- Sorry about the gun.

476
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,357
Whatever. Out.

477
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:09,734
Go. Sleep badly.

478
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:12,578
Any questions, hesitate to call.

479
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,705
- Bad.
- Excuse me?

480
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:16,208
Sleep bad.

481
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:19,377
Otherwise, it seems like
the mechanism that allows sleep...

482
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:23,124
What, fuckhead? "Badly" is an adverb.
Who taught you grammar? Out. Vanish.

483
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:27,711
- I'll give you a buzz.
- Die.

484
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:39,605
That's all right, don't apologize.

485
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:43,144
- Blow me. You forgot this.
- Oh, thanks.

486
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:46,153
<i>- Hello?
- I'm trying to locate Harry Lockhart.</i>

487
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,073
<i>- Speaking.
- I'm detective Sgt. Kale.</i>

488
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:50,366
<i>Mind answering a question or two?</i>

489
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,618
Of course, no problem.
Fire away, officer.

490
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:56,123
<i>Are you familiar with a woman
by the name of Harmony Faith Lane?</i>

491
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:57,624
Yeah, what's this...?

492
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:00,710
<i>Are you aware of giving your number
to Miss Lane recently?</i>

493
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:02,962
<i>- On a slip of paper, Perhaps?
- No.</i>

494
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:06,133
- Are you <i>sure?</i>
- Well, maybe she had my number. Why?

495
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:10,136
<i>We're required by law to treat every
suicide as a potential homicide.</i>

496
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:12,431
<i>Harmony Lane shot herself, sir.</i>

497
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:15,099
- Suicide?
- Yes...

498
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:16,768
Hello?

499
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:18,762
Hello?

500
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,601
- I'll be goddamned.
- Jesus.

501
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:30,615
Don't blame yourself. Listen...

502
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:34,035
sometimes these things just happen...
- For a reason.

503
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:36,404
For a reason? Fuck that.

504
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,209
Why? Because I fall off a building,
10 people in Baltimore...

505
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,211
survive a bus crash?

506
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:47,750
Swell, they're enjoying Baltimore.
I'm lying here with my brains out.

507
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,252
I've been to Baltimore, you win.

508
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:54,923
Listen...

509
00:32:56,517 --> 00:33:00,136
I'm really sorry. I gotta go.
- Yeah.

510
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,392
I gotta go.

511
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:08,061
I have to go.

512
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,545
<i>Genaros. Pure drinking pleasure.</i>

513
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:28,714
<i>I prefer Genaros.
But what do I know? I'm a bear.</i>

514
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,794
<i>I suck the heads off fish.</i>

515
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,131
<i>Genaros.</i>

516
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:42,144
<i>I was tired. I was pissed. I was wetter
than Drew Barrymore at a grunge club.</i>

517
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,807
<i>I needed a hot bath, a warm bed.</i>

518
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:50,237
<i>But the night had other plans for me.</i>

519
00:33:50,238 --> 00:33:52,447
- Oh, you did?
<i>- I got the Cyber Agent.</i>

520
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:55,534
- You got the Cyber Agent.
<i>- It has all the cool weapons.</i>

521
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:57,160
You got Protocop coming too.

522
00:33:57,161 --> 00:34:01,414
It's gonna be worth more too because
I think he's, like, paralyzed now.

523
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,166
Son of a bitch!

524
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:08,630
<i>See, I forgot, old Jonny,
he always had two cases. Remember?</i>

525
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,416
How are you?

526
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,418
Hey.

527
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:16,429
She's gone, Harry.

528
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,349
- Yeah.
- She's gone.

529
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:22,635
I know. Who?

530
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:26,139
Fact is, she stole not only
your credit card, but your ID.

531
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:28,817
We're very sorry about
the mix-up on our part.

532
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:30,987
So are you willing to
positively identify

533
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:32,320
this woman as your...

534
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,440
- My sister! Yes!
- Your sister was here?

535
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,657
Oh, God!
God, we haven't spoken in years.

536
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:39,402
She's never forgiven me
for leaving her all alone.

537
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:42,414
- I'm just gonna get you a blanket.
- I don't want a blanket!

538
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,324
- But you're shivering.
- I don't care!

539
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,626
You're freaking me out.
Will you relax, okay?

540
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,795
- Oh, God.
- I'm so glad that you're okay...

541
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:52,132
but now, I don't know, you're
making me more nervous. Sit down.

542
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:53,717
- Okay.
- Tell me what happened.

543
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:57,387
Yesterday, Jenna,
she got into my house, Harry.

544
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,514
She must have been broke,
I don't know.

545
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:03,143
She swiped 200 bucks, a credit card,
California ID, God knows what else.

546
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:05,228
- Right.
- Oh, God.

547
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,014
- No more lies, Harry.
- No.

548
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:08,731
No.

549
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:10,809
Are you a detective?

550
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:15,523
- Are you a detective?
- Who told you that?

551
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,365
Flicka. Flicka.
You know, my friend? She told me.

552
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:20,117
She told me you were a detective.

553
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,934
If you are, then I
really need your help.

554
00:35:21,934 --> 00:35:22,704
Well...

555
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,572
That's empty, honey.

556
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:29,536
Okay, I know this sounds crazy,
Harry, but listen. Okay. Okay.

557
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:33,380
- My sister's been living out here...
<i>- Harmony's sister, dead. What the hell?</i>

558
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:36,967
<i>What was she even doing here?
The lady in the lake, now the sister.</i>

559
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:40,512
<i>This was two corpses in three hours.
Am I crazy? That's unusual, right?</i>

560
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:43,307
<i>Yeah, looking back,
I maybe should've told her...</i>

561
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:45,469
<i>I wasn't really a nipple... Detective.</i>

562
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:49,188
<i>Detective. Sorry. I should've said
something, but she wouldn't shut up.</i>

563
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,565
The card she stole from me
was maxed out.

564
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:56,355
Right before she died, she charged over
$2000 on it. That's weird, isn't it?

565
00:35:56,364 --> 00:36:00,442
Sentron something.
Some bullshit company! Plus...

566
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:03,987
Red flag, Harry. She took her
birth control pill for the day.

567
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:06,289
Why would she even bother
with the pill, huh?

568
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,501
She was murdered, Harry.
She was murdered. She was murdered.

569
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:12,295
Honey, all right.
Relax, relax, relax. Okay, relax.

570
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,164
Are you gonna help me, Harry?

571
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,175
- I gotta check my schedule...
- If you're not gonna help me...

572
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,219
I need to get out of here,
find someone that'll help me.

573
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:22,764
- I just gotta check my schedule.
- Can you help me?

574
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:25,599
If you're not gonna help me,
I need to find somebody else!

575
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:28,721
- My caseload is pretty...
- Oh, Harry, thank you.

576
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,210
Yuck, come on.

577
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:15,023
- It was nothing. I didn't do anything.
- What are you doing?

578
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:17,610
- I didn't do anything.
- You were grabbing my tit.

579
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,320
No, there was a spider.
There was a big spider.

580
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:23,108
- Oh, please, whatever.
- I swear to God.

581
00:37:23,117 --> 00:37:28,197
Look, I'll find it. I'll find the thing.
Where are you? Fuzzy little bitch.

582
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:31,824
- Whatever. It's okay, I believe you.
- Clearly, you don't.

583
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:35,411
Look, Harry, you grabbed my tit.
It's life, all right? It's no biggie.

584
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,210
No biggie? Guy grabs your tit,
"That's life, no biggie"?

585
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:44,429
I mean, what kind of talk is that?

586
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:47,974
No, you tell me. What kind of talk
is that? I can't believe you.

587
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:51,177
I can't believe that
that's the reaction that...

588
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,434
See there?

589
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,268
Yeah.

590
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:03,106
- I trust you.
- Right.

591
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,951
What is your problem? I'm letting you
off the hook. You didn't do anything.

592
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,737
No, but you thought I did.

593
00:38:08,746 --> 00:38:12,324
Do you get it? I'm on the hook. The hook
is my home. Do you understand?

594
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:16,920
Listen to me. I grab your tit,
it's a fucking biggie!

595
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,380
That came out wrong.
But what I'm saying is...

596
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,626
you act like, "Oops, it's an okay lapse.
You know, everybody does it."

597
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:26,755
What the fuck kind of guys
you hang out with here?

598
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:29,599
I mean, are you the kind of girl
who like, you know...?

599
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,802
Who what, Harry?

600
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:34,722
Who what?

601
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,766
Forget it.

602
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,693
I'm sorry, just relax.
Just get some rest, okay?

603
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:46,074
Okay, we'll start on your case
tomorrow. All right?

604
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:48,117
- Afternoon good?
- Whatever, Harry.

605
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,619
- I'm going.
- Okay.

606
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:53,164
- I'm taking some sweats, all right?
- Yeah, anything you want to borrow.

607
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,376
- I'll give them back.
- Yeah. Yeah, anything in the drawer.

608
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:58,536
If it's in the drawer, it's clean.

609
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:01,248
Night, Harry.

610
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:05,585
Harry?

611
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,679
This is...

612
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:11,891
- This is really great.
- Isn't it?

613
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:15,394
- I'm leaving.
- Yeah, some nice rest.

614
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:16,929
Bye.

615
00:39:17,273 --> 00:39:19,599
Fuck off...!

616
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,686
Say again? They gave her back?

617
00:39:22,695 --> 00:39:25,780
Yes. She's in my shower.
I'm looking at her, for chrissake.

618
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,074
<i>That's impossible.
They don't even know you.</i>

619
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,326
You're right.
The body can't be here.

620
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:33,036
This is all a dream.
There's Elmo the elf.

621
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:35,331
<i>- Shut up. How did they get in?
- I don't know.</i>

622
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,701
How am I supposed to know?
Fire escape, maybe.

623
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:41,628
Okay, first things first. We gotta move
her somewhere. You got gloves?

624
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,672
- Excuse me?
- Gloves. Do you have gloves?

625
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:44,735
You have to move her.

626
00:39:44,735 --> 00:39:47,927
If it's a frame-up, some asshole's
calling the cops on you.

627
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:50,929
<i>Do this: Wrap up the body
in a blanket, a sheet, anything.</i>

628
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:54,384
- Okay, any particular kind of gloves?
- Yes, fawn.

629
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:56,018
<i>Will you fucking hurry?</i>

630
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,519
- Perry?
- Yeah?

631
00:39:57,521 --> 00:39:59,806
- I peed on it.
- What? You peed on what?

632
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:02,692
I peed on the corpse.
Can they do, like, an ID from that?

633
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:05,771
- I'm sorry, you peed on...?
- On the corpse. My question is...

634
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,614
No, my question. I get to go first.

635
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:10,192
Why in poo-perfect hell
would you pee on a corpse?

636
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,159
It's not like I did it for kicks.

637
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:15,079
You said this doesn't happen.
This is your fault!

638
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,498
Shut up and listen.
First, we have to wrap the body.

639
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,494
<i>Second, you've got to find the gun.</i>

640
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,539
<i>- Say this with me, "Find the gun."
- Find the gun.</i>

641
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:25,414
Damn it, I threw it in the lake.

642
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,760
Not my gun, idiot. They dropped
the body on you, it's a frame-up.

643
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,637
Then they also have planted a gun,
trust me. Move it.

644
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:34,173
I'll be there in four minutes.

645
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:58,706
Caller specified room 714, some sort of
brawl or something. Violent.

646
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:02,001
Yeah, 714. Lockhart.

647
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:05,755
- Let me get you the key.
- Actually, it's not 714, it's 514.

648
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:08,340
I was just up there,
and it's really noisy.

649
00:41:08,342 --> 00:41:11,586
- Let's get the key.
- Yep, pretty awful.

650
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:25,434
- Don't answer that.
- Yeah, duh.

651
00:41:25,693 --> 00:41:27,777
- That it?
- No, that's the corpse...

652
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,862
from the last guy who stayed here.

653
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,364
Fuck off. Was there a gun?

654
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:34,534
Yeah, it's right here. Perry,
sons of bitches made us, made me.

655
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:37,869
I'm in town for two days, they know
who I am and where to find me.

656
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:38,969
That's impossible.

657
00:41:38,969 --> 00:41:41,909
Yeah, it's totally nuts.
Back stairway.

658
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:47,045
I forgot to tell you, Harmony's alive.
She thinks her sister was murdered.

659
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:49,081
- Come again?
- Never mind.

660
00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:07,817
See, these dudes tonight,
they see two assholes out of nowhere.

661
00:42:07,818 --> 00:42:10,436
- What do they think?
- They think we know something.

662
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:13,822
They panic. They got a body,
they've gotta dispose of the evidence.

663
00:42:13,824 --> 00:42:15,907
In my shower?
Come on, you said real life.

664
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:20,413
- They were setting you up, dummy.
- They're not setting me up. Shut up.

665
00:42:20,414 --> 00:42:22,831
You change your tune
every five minutes.

666
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:25,327
- Kiss me.
- What? No, no, no.

667
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,958
Check out Doris and Lucinda
over here.

668
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:41,050
These lessons suck.

669
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:44,436
I quit. This is not being a detective.
Corpses floating in lakes...

670
00:42:44,438 --> 00:42:48,648
people kissing people. This is wrong.
This is every shade of wrong.

671
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:51,018
Somebody wanna fill me in?

672
00:42:52,112 --> 00:42:54,572
She thinks I'm a detective,
so go along with it.

673
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,190
- What?
- Don't fuck me up.

674
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,860
Hey.

675
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:01,913
Do you know the oops
are looking for you, Harry?

676
00:43:01,914 --> 00:43:03,414
- They are?
- Yeah.

677
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,617
I sent them to the wrong room.
I didn't know what else to do.

678
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:09,329
You did fine.
Perry and I, we're just...

679
00:43:09,338 --> 00:43:12,047
- Hiya, Perry.
- We're just running, you know, a game.

680
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,925
Perry, what do you call it?

681
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:18,471
The old Bring Them In and Push
Them Out. That's what we're doing.

682
00:43:18,472 --> 00:43:19,972
What's going on?

683
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:23,092
Why are you and Perry nacking
on each other?

684
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:30,440
<i>I sent her home believing, A, we'd meet
tomorrow to go over her case...</i>

685
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:32,811
<i>and, B, I wasn't actually gay.</i>

686
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:35,313
<i>Do not ask me how I did B.</i>

687
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,572
Why didn't we just leave it there?

688
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:40,034
Think, dummy.
A 911 call from your hotel room...

689
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,869
all of a sudden,
there's a corpse outside? Bad idea.

690
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:46,498
Speaking of bad ideas, what's this
about you taking on your own case?

691
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,793
Of all the dipshit things to do.

692
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,536
Killed herself, by the way.

693
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,713
Killed herself.
I solved your case for you.

694
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:55,882
- Harmony's convinced...
- I don't care about... Listen to me.

695
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:59,344
- Little sis punched her own ticket.
- Okay. Gotcha.

696
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:02,882
All right, this looks good up ahead.
Time to lose the luggage.

697
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:12,440
Sorry, sweetheart.

698
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:14,603
You deserved better.

699
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,498
Before I left,
I got her into foster care.

700
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:31,335
I've never told you just how awful he
treated her. My dad, I'm talking about.

701
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:34,422
I'll tell you what,
I take notes, in general...

702
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:39,210
so if you're just real specific,
thorough and precise, that'll help.

703
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:42,346
I remember only lying to her one time.

704
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:43,965
I said to her:

705
00:44:43,974 --> 00:44:47,219
"Maybe the man who is living here
is not your father."

706
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:50,137
You told your sister
she was adopted, yeah?

707
00:44:50,898 --> 00:44:52,523
No, I did one better.

708
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,733
I told her her real father
was an actor...

709
00:44:54,735 --> 00:44:57,445
who was in the movie
that came through town.

710
00:44:57,445 --> 00:45:00,398
- Jonny Gossamer...
- Jonny Gossamer movie. That's right.

711
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:03,451
I told Jenna one day she'd go
to Hollywood...

712
00:45:03,452 --> 00:45:06,530
and she'd meet her famous,
real father.

713
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:22,344
She believed me, Harry,
and she came out here looking for him.

714
00:45:22,346 --> 00:45:25,757
Okay, this is a bunch.
I can start my...

715
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:28,385
process, I guess.
- Thank you.

716
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:31,512
I'm on the case. Here is my card.

717
00:45:33,023 --> 00:45:35,934
- It's a magic card, so...
- Wow, "the Amazing Harold."

718
00:45:35,943 --> 00:45:39,186
- Just say "abracadabra."
- What happened, somebody sue you?

719
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,239
It used to be "alakazam"
when you cut me in half.

720
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,034
And, not to be picky,
but it was "Harold the Great."

721
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:48,905
No, I used to be great,
now I'm amazing. Get with it.

722
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:52,576
<i>Hi, it's me. You hear anything?</i>

723
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,668
No, there's nothing
in the papers, so...

724
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:57,539
I'm busy working on Harmony's case.

725
00:45:57,547 --> 00:45:59,123
<i>What case? Leave her alone.</i>

726
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:02,543
<i>News on Channel 5, just starting.
Call me after.</i>

727
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:06,222
<i>...a kidnapping gone wrong.
It is unclear why his daughter...</i>

728
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:08,340
<i>... was subsequently murdered
or where...</i>

729
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:12,228
<i>for she was almost certainly killed
and then moved, police sources say.</i>

730
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:15,231
<i>Veronica Dexter was reported missing
yesterday afternoon...</i>

731
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:18,108
<i>when she failed to greet
her boyfriend at the airport.</i>

732
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:21,487
<i>Miss Dexter recently made headlines
when she returned from Paris...</i>

733
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:24,990
<i>and withdrew her multimillion-dollar
lawsuit against her father...</i>

734
00:46:24,992 --> 00:46:27,867
<i>actor-turned-entrepreneur
Harlan Dexter.</i>

735
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:30,204
<i>Mr. Dexter owns
the prestigious Dexter Clinic.</i>

736
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:33,958
<i>His wife died last spring, prompting
Veronica's return to the U.S...</i>

737
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:37,954
<i>and a father-daughter reconciliation
following years of estrangement.</i>

738
00:46:37,963 --> 00:46:42,416
<i>Veronica Dexter,
25 years old yesterday. Paul.</i>

739
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:44,927
We were just at that party.
Are you telling me...

740
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:47,722
that the girl in the lake,
that was Veronica Dexter?

741
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:49,681
Positive ID, scars, dental records.

742
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:52,476
- You talked to your police guy?
- Yeah, not much there.

743
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,554
The lab report came back,
no sign of rape.

744
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:57,398
Boils down to this:

745
00:46:57,398 --> 00:47:01,527
Veronica Dexter, yesterday afternoon
about 4:30, left her home.

746
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:05,405
Went off to the airport, pick up
some dude, old boyfriend. Off she went.

747
00:47:05,407 --> 00:47:09,159
- That was the last anybody saw of her?
- With a symmetrical, ungooshed head.

748
00:47:09,161 --> 00:47:10,827
Police ever find the car?

749
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:13,155
No, genius, that was us. Remember?

750
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:14,824
Oh, yeah, right.

751
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:17,835
- The killers were at the party, Harry.
- They were?

752
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:21,248
- The killers were at Dexter's?
- That's how they recognized you.

753
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:24,592
It's getting too scary. You gotta bail.
Get a flight out, today.

754
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:27,887
But I got my screen test Tuesday.
I'll go Wednesday.

755
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:30,965
- You're not getting the part.
- Fuck off. Don't be a schmuck.

756
00:47:30,974 --> 00:47:33,851
- I know it's a long shot.
- You're not gonna get the part.

757
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,603
You're not listening to me.
You won't get the... Harry!

758
00:47:36,605 --> 00:47:41,525
You're not gonna get the part, okay?
Colin Farrell wants too much money.

759
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,269
Do you get me now?

760
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:47,690
Dabney, he unearths a discovery.
New kid, works for cheap.

761
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:50,318
Flies him out here,
high profile, parties...

762
00:47:50,327 --> 00:47:53,530
screen tests,
detective lessons, all of it.

763
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:55,039
You were just being used.

764
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,909
Shave a couple million
off of Colin Farrell's price tag.

765
00:47:59,628 --> 00:48:02,121
Sorry, chief. There it is.

766
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,416
I'm not gonna lie to you anymore.

767
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:10,005
I understand if you wanna
take a swing at me. You fuck!

768
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,922
You sissy bitch!

769
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:13,431
Stop.

770
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,726
Don't bother asking Harmony out
on your date.

771
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:20,731
She wasn't very happy to find out that
you're not a detective, that you lied.

772
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,809
- You told her?
- Pick those up.

773
00:48:22,818 --> 00:48:24,643
Pick them up.

774
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:28,188
Why did you tell her?
You didn't have to tell her.

775
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:30,112
I am an idiot. I
thought we were friends.

776
00:48:30,112 --> 00:48:31,324
We're not friends.

777
00:48:31,326 --> 00:48:33,248
I was in trouble, you
were there for me.

778
00:48:33,248 --> 00:48:34,947
No, I was... Stop speaking.

779
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:37,907
I was there protecting
my employer, Dabney. Hello.

780
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:40,284
He pays me to insulate him
from corpses.

781
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:48,467
I'm not a nice man, Harry.

782
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,128
Go home before something bad
happens to you.

783
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:53,639
- What, are you threatening me?
- No, moron.

784
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,391
Go home before the bad guys
do something bad to you.

785
00:48:56,393 --> 00:48:58,510
Right, I get it. Fine.

786
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:01,396
Merry Christmas.
Sorry I fucked you over.

787
00:49:01,398 --> 00:49:04,768
No problem. Don't quit your gay job.

788
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:20,199
<i>Arriving passengers
from flight number 758 from Denver...</i>

789
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:22,952
<i>may retrieve their baggage
at carousel two.</i>

790
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:30,967
Hey, Flicka. Hey, it's me, Harry.

791
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:33,262
Remember me?
What's up, honey? How are you?

792
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:35,972
- She doesn't want to talk to you.
- Oh, no, no. I know.

793
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:38,641
Did you ever think maybe
I don't want to talk to her?

794
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:41,103
I just saw your really distinctive ears.

795
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,481
You look different,
but it's obviously Flicka.

796
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:45,983
- Maybe it's you I'm interested in.
- Is that true?

797
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,110
Not really. Look, she must have
a cell phone, right? She must.

798
00:49:49,112 --> 00:49:52,864
- Forget it. This is between you two.
- Look, I got a ticket. I am leaving.

799
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:55,826
I'm going back to the East Coast,
and that's...

800
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:58,786
No? Come on,
I just want to say something to her.

801
00:49:58,788 --> 00:50:02,750
Just anything before I split.
I'm begging you. Come on, help me out.

802
00:50:02,751 --> 00:50:04,918
- I'm gonna regret this.
- No, you're not...

803
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,789
and that is a very smart suit,
by the way.

804
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:12,376
- It's not here, that's funny.
- What's funny?

805
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:14,427
Nothing.
It's just under her stage name.

806
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:18,014
Oh, God. Everyone's got a stage name.
What's her stage name?

807
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:20,976
Ames. Allison Ames.

808
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:23,353
Okay, well, I'll just write it down
and then...

809
00:50:23,355 --> 00:50:25,681
Hey! Say that name again.

810
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:28,858
- Allison Ames.
- Allison Ames. A-M-E-S.

811
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,070
- That's her stage name.
- I just said that.

812
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,947
That's the name on her credit cards.

813
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:36,742
- How am I supposed to know?
- Fuck! Thanks, honey. Gotta roll.

814
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,610
Later.

815
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:43,574
<i>You have reached the offices
of Sentron, Inc. Leave a message.</i>

816
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:47,043
Newsflash, Perry. Your client, Ames,
it was the little sister.

817
00:50:47,045 --> 00:50:48,963
Repeat, the little sister.

818
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:51,047
That's where Harmony's
2 grand went.

819
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,425
It's in your bank,
you overpriced bastard.

820
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,344
Her kid sister hired you.

821
00:50:55,344 --> 00:51:01,175
Do you get this? Your case and my case
are the same fucking case.

822
00:51:01,518 --> 00:51:03,887
- Come on!
- Get out of my life!

823
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:07,766
I'm at the airport, right,
and I run into Flicka, and she says...

824
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:11,402
- Did I just cut off your finger?
- Yeah.

825
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:14,565
It's on the floor, to my
periph... I don't wanna see it.

826
00:51:14,565 --> 00:51:16,233
Pick it up, put it on ice.

827
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:18,067
Thanks.

828
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,873
<i>You're a genius, Harry.
You're a genius.</i>

829
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:29,420
<i>Oh, my God, I'm so sorry I had to bail
on you, but I had to go to work.</i>

830
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,213
<i>I am going nuts here.
I can't stop thinking about this.</i>

831
00:51:32,215 --> 00:51:35,009
<i>What's my sister's connection
to Veronica Dexter?</i>

832
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:38,971
<i>She predicted that murder, Harry. She
sent you and Perry to that exact spot.</i>

833
00:51:38,972 --> 00:51:43,300
That whole thing is wild. You know what
else is nuts? You cut off my finger!

834
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:47,554
Oh, God, Harry,
I am so sorry about that. How is it?

835
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:50,440
It's fine. It's all shut up.
They gave me painkillers.

836
00:51:50,442 --> 00:51:53,478
- Where's Perry? We gotta find him.
- Perry's coming by here.

837
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,362
I'm working a party on Sunset Plaza.

838
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,865
Remember you said the killer may have
been at Dexter's party?

839
00:51:58,867 --> 00:52:00,751
<i>Well, that whole bunch
is here tonight.</i>

840
00:52:00,753 --> 00:52:03,036
Honey, put me on the list,
I'll drop by.

841
00:52:03,038 --> 00:52:05,005
I'll see if I can stir up the kettle,

842
00:52:05,007 --> 00:52:07,498
stick out my hat,
see if anyone shoots at it.

843
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,751
Maybe you could put the hat
in the kettle...

844
00:52:09,753 --> 00:52:13,672
and if they shoot at it, it'll ricochet.
Harry, you sound trashed.

845
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,666
Give me the address. I'm coming.

846
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,387
<i>I showed up mildly whacked
on Demerol...</i>

847
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,349
<i>thinking Harmony's theory
wasn't so crazy.</i>

848
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,849
Hi.

849
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:27,853
<i>What if little sis had been murdered
by the same assholes...</i>

850
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,480
<i>who offed Veronica Dexter?</i>

851
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:31,690
<i>Remember?
With the ski masks, those dudes.</i>

852
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,608
<i>Then and there, I made a decision.</i>

853
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:37,005
<i>If it fucking killed me,
I would not stop...</i>

854
00:52:37,012 --> 00:52:40,023
<i>until I got, like,
two more Demerol.</i>

855
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:45,228
<i>No, seriously, I was on the case.
Harry Lockhart, L.A.P.I.</i>

856
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:05,306
- I got it.
- What do you got?

857
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:08,594
Just now. My friend Tiff
does the video dubbing at Fox.

858
00:53:09,938 --> 00:53:13,190
- "Lord of the Cock Rings."
- No, Harry, it's a fake label.

859
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,943
Copyright infringement, she'd get fired.
It's a Jonny Gossamer movie.

860
00:53:16,945 --> 00:53:21,239
If Jenna was hunting her mystery dad,
this is where she would start, right?

861
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,367
- Jesus, don't patronize me!
- I'm not.

862
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:24,518
You're patronizing me.

863
00:53:24,519 --> 00:53:27,280
No, I'm not. It's just
a funny little buzz.

864
00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:29,956
I don't know if this guy's
your boyfriend or not...

865
00:53:29,958 --> 00:53:33,077
but when you were in the bathroom,
he was checking me out.

866
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:37,547
What? What is it out here
with these women?

867
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:40,092
Please, they're no different
from anywhere else.

868
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:44,088
They are. These are damaged goods,
every one of them, from way back.

869
00:53:44,097 --> 00:53:47,599
Take a guy who sleeps with 100 women
a year, go into his childhood...

870
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,393
dollars to doughnuts,
it's relatively unspectacular.

871
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:54,021
Now, you take one of these gals
who sleeps with 100 guys a year...

872
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:56,817
and I bet you
if you look in their childhood...

873
00:53:56,818 --> 00:53:59,027
there's something rotten in Denver.

874
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,280
- Denmark.
- That too. But it's abandonment...

875
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,407
It's abuse. It's, "My uncle
put his ping-ping in my papa."

876
00:54:04,409 --> 00:54:05,909
Then they all come out here.

877
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:09,121
It's like someone took America
by the East Coast and shook it...

878
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:11,498
and all the normal girls
managed to hang on.

879
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:15,619
Okay, everybody who hates Harry
here raise their hand.

880
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:20,583
- See that? Obedient little bitches too.
- Fuck you!

881
00:54:20,592 --> 00:54:22,175
Hey.

882
00:54:22,177 --> 00:54:26,005
Okay, you've got 30 of my
fucking seconds, thrill me.

883
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,307
All right, guys, cast list.

884
00:54:29,309 --> 00:54:32,219
Catch. That's the credit card
my sister used to hire you.

885
00:54:33,438 --> 00:54:35,606
So who's in this cinematic milestone?

886
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:38,121
We got a Michael Beck,
whoever that is.

887
00:54:38,121 --> 00:54:40,710
Oh, he's the star of Xanadu...

888
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:43,371
...with Olivia Newton-John and Gene Kelly.
- Gay.

889
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:45,699
- What?
- Nothing.

890
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:49,202
Perry, listen up. I know this is
a long shot, but indulge me, please.

891
00:54:49,204 --> 00:54:51,746
We gotta lose the hat.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't...

892
00:54:51,748 --> 00:54:54,166
- God, I'm working!
- I know, but just forget it.

893
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:58,085
Seriously, don't jump all over me.
Just pay attention. Watch it, please.

894
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,713
- That's Harlan Dexter.
- What?

895
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,166
- Who's Har...? What?
- Look, that's...

896
00:55:02,175 --> 00:55:04,967
He's 20 years younger,
but that's Harlan Dexter.

897
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:07,422
<i>Always sees the inside
of a police van.</i>

898
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:10,465
No way.

899
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:15,512
This kind of makes sense. He had
the Gossamer books at his house.

900
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:17,056
Used to be an actor.

901
00:55:17,065 --> 00:55:20,684
I remember him now. 1980.
Oh, my God, I saw him like this.

902
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:22,811
- Young.
- Where?

903
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,489
In Indiana. He was there
with the movie crew.

904
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:29,818
Remember, I told you he looked familiar.
Oh, God, this can't be true.

905
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:34,539
And your sister has to have seen this,
so you know what it comes down to.

906
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:37,543
You tell your sister a fairy tale
about her real father...

907
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:41,289
And 20 years later, she comes out
to L.A. hunting Harlan Dexter.

908
00:55:44,384 --> 00:55:47,344
I've got a surveillance
in MacArthur Park.

909
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:51,264
I gotta follow some chick around
till midnight. Do not play detective.

910
00:55:51,266 --> 00:55:53,516
This is not a book. This is not a movie.

911
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:55,476
We got it. Do you think I'm stupid?

912
00:55:55,478 --> 00:55:57,728
You wouldn't know where
to feed yourself...

913
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:02,851
if you didn't flap your mouth so much.
Yes, I think you're stupid.

914
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:07,565
Harry, don't listen to a word he says,
all right? We're getting somewhere.

915
00:56:07,574 --> 00:56:10,074
I'll call you tomorrow.
I'm going back to work.

916
00:56:10,076 --> 00:56:11,277
Good.

917
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,755
- Excuse me.
- What's up, baby? How you feeling?

918
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:33,599
- I'm just gonna...
- Come and take a walk. Walk with me.

919
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,967
Great, this is fucking rich.

920
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:40,313
Well, now, here we all are:

921
00:56:40,315 --> 00:56:44,393
- Ike, Mike and Mustard.
- What the hell does that mean?

922
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:47,403
I'm with him on this one.
That's pretty fucking obscure.

923
00:56:47,405 --> 00:56:49,447
- I hear that all the time.
- You do?

924
00:56:49,449 --> 00:56:51,824
- Yeah, sure.
- Where? At the 1942 Club?

925
00:56:51,826 --> 00:56:53,188
Just because you didn't get it...

926
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:54,847
Motherfucker, I could...
Hey...!

927
00:56:54,849 --> 00:56:55,938
Slow your roll, man!

928
00:56:55,938 --> 00:56:59,534
This is bullshit. What will you do,
take me out here? There's sec...

929
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:02,744
- Keep talking. Keep talking.
- You wanna know who we are?

930
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:05,672
I'm the frying pan, see?
And my boy over here...

931
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:08,458
He's Mustard.
I'm Mustard, baby.

932
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,001
- Sure.
- He's the fire.

933
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:13,297
- Fuck you, Mr. Mustard.
- Here we go.

934
00:57:13,306 --> 00:57:16,724
Now, me and my man, we're puzzled
lately by your behavior, such as...

935
00:57:16,726 --> 00:57:22,722
Such as why is a savvy, stand-up cat
like yourself consorting with gay men?

936
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,360
Frolicking in the lake together.
What is that?

937
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,813
You're the guys
who were wearing the masks.

938
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:32,239
- You don't ask the questions.
- Don't ask questions.

939
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,744
God, you just tore up my fucking
finger! I just got this fixed. Jesus!

940
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:38,829
I bet there's a doctor in New York,
clear that shit right up.

941
00:57:38,831 --> 00:57:40,615
Clear it right up.

942
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:48,248
L.A. don't want you no more,
tough guy.

943
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,333
All right?

944
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:54,554
- How much further to the hospital?
- Five minutes away.

945
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:57,592
Talk to me. Our mascot,
back in high school, who was it?

946
00:57:57,766 --> 00:58:00,010
Come on, Harry, stay with me.

947
00:58:01,521 --> 00:58:03,431
Whitey, the white knight. Whitey.

948
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,815
I guess it's better
than calling him "Knighty."

949
00:58:05,817 --> 00:58:09,686
Then it'd be Knighty Knight. Soon
it'd be Toodles, and then Ta-Ta.

950
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:13,481
- It's very emasculating.
- Harry, that's them. Twelve o'clock.

951
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:16,235
You said it's a black guy
and a white guy?

952
00:58:16,244 --> 00:58:18,411
You're right.
Get the plate, call the cops.

953
00:58:18,413 --> 00:58:21,657
- Let me find a pen.
- No. Whatever. Watch the road.

954
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:23,291
Are we slowing down?

955
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:26,621
- No, I'm getting a pen.
- Are you following them? Better not be.

956
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:30,423
- Tell me you're not following them.
- I'm taking you to the hospital.

957
00:58:30,425 --> 00:58:33,668
- Oh, shit. They're turning.
- What?

958
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,170
Holy shit.

959
00:58:36,389 --> 00:58:40,684
Perry's stakeout. It's a setup. They're
going to MacArthur Park after Perry!

960
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:43,887
Wait a second! My finger's hanging off.
We gotta move on this.

961
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:46,766
We're gonna go save Perry,
really quickly.

962
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,559
Then we'll go fix your finger.

963
00:58:48,568 --> 00:58:52,396
It'll be like, "Hey, Perry, look out."
Boom, back in the oar. All right?

964
00:58:52,405 --> 00:58:55,523
- Cool?
- Yeah. This is exhausting.

965
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:59,237
Bingo. All right. All right, Harry.

966
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:02,530
Twelve o'clock, that's them.
One of them is on foot.

967
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:11,206
God, Harry. Shit, if I leave the keys,
can you take yourself to the hospital?

968
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:12,965
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- All right, good.

969
00:59:12,967 --> 00:59:15,543
- I got the gun you gave me.
- You what?

970
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:14,186
Perry!

971
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,440
Now, where you going?

972
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:23,278
No, no, no. Don't fight it.

973
01:00:24,163 --> 01:00:26,532
Let it happen, baby.

974
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:02,193
Perry!

975
01:01:08,291 --> 01:01:11,619
Perry, watch out!
Goddamn it, turn around!

976
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:24,172
Son of a bitch!

977
01:01:31,731 --> 01:01:35,309
How about that, you fucking animals!
Goddamn cocksuckers.

978
01:01:58,132 --> 01:02:00,300
- Perry.
- Where the hell did you come from?

979
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,677
- He got away.
- It's okay. You did good.

980
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:06,597
- I couldn't shoot him, Perry. Oh, God.
- You did fine. You did fine.

981
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:08,425
We gotta go now.

982
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:26,277
Hello?

983
01:02:37,213 --> 01:02:39,206
Anyone home?

984
01:02:46,097 --> 01:02:47,965
Hello?

985
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:54,304
Anyone home?
I got an injury problem. Hello.

986
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:57,891
All right, first things first.
You've gotta ditch that car.

987
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:00,402
I know, I know. I've...

988
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:04,822
I know you said that there was
gonna be consequences, but fuck.

989
01:03:04,824 --> 01:03:06,992
I saw him shot to death.

990
01:03:06,992 --> 01:03:12,114
- I was scared.
- Look, it's okay, yeah.

991
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:16,835
We can absolutely
talk about it, all right?

992
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:19,378
Thank you. Thank you so much.

993
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:22,215
It's nothing against your boss.
I'm grateful. I just...

994
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,717
I spoke to him.

995
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:26,719
You'll never have to go through anything
like that again.

996
01:03:26,721 --> 01:03:28,672
I swear.

997
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:31,099
Promise?

998
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:32,842
Yep.

999
01:03:42,695 --> 01:03:44,230
Who are you?

1000
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:47,608
Who are you?

1001
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,985
Who...?

1002
01:04:34,413 --> 01:04:36,155
Well, hey.

1003
01:04:39,126 --> 01:04:42,454
So you still here, huh, tough guy?

1004
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:45,666
Oh, you got a gun, I see.

1005
01:04:47,134 --> 01:04:49,085
Well, damn, you are tough.

1006
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:40,346
Sorry.

1007
01:05:53,534 --> 01:05:55,610
Fuck.

1008
01:06:06,922 --> 01:06:09,090
Hey. Hey!

1009
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,416
Sit.

1010
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:20,135
- Yeah? What?
<i>- Where the hell are you?</i>

1011
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:23,980
I'm with one of the kidnappers. One of
them, anyhow. I shot him. He's dead.

1012
01:06:23,981 --> 01:06:25,516
Come here, you fuck.

1013
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,809
<i>Wipe the place clean
and get out of there.</i>

1014
01:06:27,818 --> 01:06:29,519
I want to, but I can't.

1015
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:30,474
So do it.

1016
01:06:30,474 --> 01:06:33,072
My fingerprint's here.
The dog's got it.

1017
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:37,452
<i>- No one's gonna dust the fucking dog.
- He's got the finger, asshole...</i>

1018
01:06:37,452 --> 01:06:40,704
<i>- with the print part.
- Get the finger, kill the dog, get out.</i>

1019
01:06:40,706 --> 01:06:42,916
Hang on.

1020
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:46,661
Shit. Well, I think...

1021
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,914
I think we're safe.

1022
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:50,916
<i>Harry?</i>

1023
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:55,211
- Harry?
- Hey, Perry, I shot a guy.

1024
01:06:55,471 --> 01:06:58,090
I never did that before.

1025
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:01,260
<i>Harry, listen...</i>

1026
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:12,820
<i>...link to the items found
in the Silver Lake home...</i>

1027
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,606
<i>to the kidnap-murder
of socialite Veronica Dexter.</i>

1028
01:07:15,824 --> 01:07:18,409
<i>Police theorize a falling out
between the kidnappers...</i>

1029
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:21,788
<i>resulting in at least two deaths,
and possibly a third tonight.</i>

1030
01:07:21,789 --> 01:07:25,123
So this evening,
was it Jonny Gossamer enough for you?

1031
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:28,878
To tell you the truth, Jonny Gossamer
always has a way bigger ending.

1032
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,547
There's always the part
where the guy gets tortured.

1033
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:35,668
Yeah, tortured, sure. Then he usually
breaks free and shoots, like, 16 guys.

1034
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:39,297
Yeah, 16 guys. It's always 16.
That's funny.

1035
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,159
So this thing, it's over, right?

1036
01:07:45,159 --> 01:07:47,730
They say the kidnappers
are all dead, so...

1037
01:07:47,731 --> 01:07:50,483
Well, Harry, I'd be lying to you
if I didn't say...

1038
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:53,193
that I still didn't have
a few questions.

1039
01:07:53,195 --> 01:07:54,903
Harmony's sister.

1040
01:07:54,905 --> 01:07:58,324
If she stumbles on a murder plot,
why hire me to film it?

1041
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:01,536
- Why not simply go to the police?
- Right. And I still think...

1042
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:04,746
this Veronica Dexter
father-daughter business is wanky.

1043
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:07,916
So the whole reconcilement thing?

1044
01:08:07,918 --> 01:08:09,793
"Reconciliation," idiot.

1045
01:08:09,795 --> 01:08:14,215
She comes back to the States, drops
the lawsuit, moves in with her father.

1046
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:17,252
- Suddenly they're inseparable?
- So, what are you saying?

1047
01:08:17,261 --> 01:08:19,671
We're gonna, like, probe deeper?

1048
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,471
- Absolutely not.
- What?

1049
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:23,926
What are you talking about?
My sister paid you.

1050
01:08:23,934 --> 01:08:26,269
- What, you're gonna bail?
- Harmony...

1051
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:28,688
do you want your sister's
money back? Done.

1052
01:08:28,689 --> 01:08:31,356
In the meantime, back off.

1053
01:08:31,358 --> 01:08:33,435
Before you get me and Harry killed.

1054
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,292
Pardon me.

1055
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:51,627
Hey, I lucked out.
They gave me the same room.

1056
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:54,296
- Lucky you.
- It's pretty good. You wanna come up?

1057
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:57,376
No, I don't wanna come up.
Why would I go up there?

1058
01:08:57,384 --> 01:09:00,462
- They cleaned it.
- The car is coming. I'm going. Jesus.

1059
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:07,135
You know what, Harry? Stop.

1060
01:09:08,228 --> 01:09:10,305
Why'd you lie to me?

1061
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:16,228
It was an excuse to stay around you.
So I think, in the realm of lies...

1062
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:18,104
You are such a dumb-ass.

1063
01:09:19,573 --> 01:09:23,201
- I am so not who you think I am, Harry.
- And who would that be?

1064
01:09:23,202 --> 01:09:26,070
You think I'm... You think I'm amazing.

1065
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:28,782
You do. You think I'm so amazing...

1066
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:31,000
because that's who
I told you I'd be.

1067
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:32,786
Yeah, that was the game plan.

1068
01:09:32,795 --> 01:09:35,663
- You know what? It worked.
- No one else thinks so.

1069
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:39,167
- My opinion doesn't count?
- No, it doesn't.

1070
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:40,717
Because you're new here.

1071
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:42,880
Look around,
there's younger and better.

1072
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:45,465
I don't want younger and better,
I want you.

1073
01:09:45,474 --> 01:09:47,842
I'm such a moron. I'm sorry.
You know what...

1074
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,262
- It doesn't matter, I'm going.

1075
01:09:49,264 --> 01:09:51,055
Look, just...
I'm such an idiot.

1076
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:57,269
I steal shit.

1077
01:09:59,697 --> 01:10:01,988
- Come again?
- That's what I do for a living.

1078
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:03,908
I steal audio-visual components.

1079
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:07,412
I steal. I robbed a house.
I stole this watch.

1080
01:10:07,412 --> 01:10:11,490
It's a cool watch. It's got this
little light thing. I stole this gum...

1081
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:15,203
from the lobby,
because it was kind of a rush.

1082
01:10:15,212 --> 01:10:20,708
I've never finished anything
that I've started my entire life.

1083
01:10:21,969 --> 01:10:25,005
Not school, not marriage, nothing.

1084
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:29,100
And I have this thing where,
like halfway in the middle, I just...

1085
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,094
and I cut and run.

1086
01:10:31,103 --> 01:10:34,229
Like the other night
when you were all over me...

1087
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,565
and you gave up
and just went for it with...

1088
01:10:36,567 --> 01:10:40,436
Prime example. I switched to the ugly
friend. Homely friend. She's not ugly.

1089
01:10:40,445 --> 01:10:42,855
She's homely.

1090
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:47,618
Don't go. Please.

1091
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:49,494
Not yet.

1092
01:10:49,496 --> 01:10:51,323
This isn't finished.

1093
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:01,423
- Turn around.
- Why?

1094
01:11:01,425 --> 01:11:04,301
- Just turn around.
- What, my tag's out?

1095
01:11:04,302 --> 01:11:07,965
- This dump have a bar?
- Yeah.

1096
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:11,217
- Call me "Slick" from here on out.
- That was such a good job.

1097
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:13,226
You snagged a ton of gum.

1098
01:11:13,228 --> 01:11:16,521
- I mean, petty theft...
- Oh, Harry.

1099
01:11:16,523 --> 01:11:20,609
I really didn't need
that last shot of tequila.

1100
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:23,854
Oh, God.

1101
01:11:37,002 --> 01:11:39,545
I just had a weird thought.

1102
01:11:39,546 --> 01:11:41,688
Veronica Dexter.
I saw the body up close.

1103
01:11:41,689 --> 01:11:43,381
Hell, I carried the damn thing.

1104
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:46,927
Both times, the dress was soaked
through, so it was transparent. So...

1105
01:11:46,929 --> 01:11:49,715
God, Harry,
where are you going with this?

1106
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,925
No, no, no. It's just...

1107
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:55,478
Perry said this chick was deep
into the born-again bit...

1108
01:11:55,479 --> 01:12:00,891
so it's probably nothing,
but just if she had on underwear...

1109
01:12:01,443 --> 01:12:04,854
I didn't see any.

1110
01:12:06,907 --> 01:12:10,493
- I guess I'm taking the couch.
- Yeah. Thanks.

1111
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:15,198
Or you can sleep here.
But it would only be sleeping, Harry.

1112
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,994
If that's gonna frustrate you.

1113
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:22,497
Let's see.

1114
01:12:29,637 --> 01:12:32,256
Oh, Harry.

1115
01:12:33,684 --> 01:12:36,136
So long ago.

1116
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:42,600
Didn't really turn out
the way we hoped, did it?

1117
01:12:43,318 --> 01:12:49,518
I guess if I racked my brain,
I could think of worse places to be.

1118
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:55,662
- Is that so, Whitey?
- Whitey?

1119
01:12:55,663 --> 01:12:57,998
- Calling me a knight?
- Maybe, yeah.

1120
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,210
Except for the boner.
That's not too knightly.

1121
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:04,581
The hell it isn't. Actually,
it's nightly and most mornings.

1122
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:12,971
Fuck it, I'm not a knight. I'm sorry.

1123
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:15,640
I'm thinking...
I'm going nuts, so I think maybe...

1124
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,101
the couch is good.
- What? Stop. Harry.

1125
01:13:18,103 --> 01:13:20,313
Or I can keep drinking
until it goes away.

1126
01:13:20,314 --> 01:13:22,939
Harry, seriously,
if you're at all uncomfortable...

1127
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:25,435
I am more than happy
to do something.

1128
01:13:25,444 --> 01:13:27,110
- For chrissake, no.
- Why not?

1129
01:13:27,112 --> 01:13:30,439
I don't want you to offer it as...
Not, "it's a courtesy freebie."

1130
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:32,658
- You're so anal.
- I don't want the backup:

1131
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:35,744
"Let me just give you a hand here"...

1132
01:13:35,746 --> 01:13:41,368
as a kind of, like,
default backup thing.

1133
01:14:01,688 --> 01:14:05,065
You're gonna stop calling me.

1134
01:14:05,067 --> 01:14:07,068
No. You know, that's crazy.

1135
01:14:07,069 --> 01:14:09,104
I swear to God, this is it.

1136
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:11,822
You are the dream girl.
You always have been.

1137
01:14:11,823 --> 01:14:14,525
This is destiny.

1138
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:16,862
Okay.

1139
01:14:21,917 --> 01:14:24,961
Before we do this...

1140
01:14:24,962 --> 01:14:27,956
I have a little confession to make.

1141
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:33,170
My best friend! You said you were going
to drop by his house, wave goodbye.

1142
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:35,805
I was leaving for L.A.
I was never gonna see him...

1143
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:37,640
- He looked sad.
- He looked sad?

1144
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:40,176
- Yes, he did.
- You slept with Chock Chutney.

1145
01:14:40,185 --> 01:14:42,853
Fuck. For chrissake, Harry,
it was forever ago.

1146
01:14:42,854 --> 01:14:45,222
Come on,
I was a different person back then.

1147
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:47,649
- You slept with Chook. Excuse me.
- Come on.

1148
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:49,810
- Watch your hand.
- Harry!

1149
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:33,939
<i>- Yeah.
- Harry, was she raped?</i>

1150
01:15:35,032 --> 01:15:37,234
The Dexter girl, was she raped?

1151
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:41,703
No, the ME's report showed no
indication of rape stuff.

1152
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,698
You slept with Chock Chutney.

1153
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:05,427
Wake up. Harry, wake up.

1154
01:16:06,688 --> 01:16:09,189
- Get up.
- What's up?

1155
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:11,817
Harmony's in trouble. Get dressed.

1156
01:16:11,818 --> 01:16:13,645
Let's go.

1157
01:16:15,613 --> 01:16:19,074
<i>Perry, it's me. Listen,
this Veronica Dexter business stinks.</i>

1158
01:16:19,076 --> 01:16:21,452
<i>I'm gonna go
check on something Harry said.</i>

1159
01:16:21,453 --> 01:16:23,697
<i>Call me. If I'm right, you'll shit.</i>

1160
01:16:24,122 --> 01:16:26,032
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing.

1161
01:16:26,041 --> 01:16:29,251
- I don't get what's happening.
- She solved this thing.

1162
01:16:29,252 --> 01:16:33,881
That sly little minx of yours has solved
this case, and now I can't find her.

1163
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:36,091
- You're worried.
- You're not worried?

1164
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:38,002
Of course. If you are, I should be.

1165
01:16:38,011 --> 01:16:40,005
Now, what did you say? Think.

1166
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:43,132
- You said something about the case.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1167
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,010
What?

1168
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:53,234
<i>I tell him about destiny.
He's shaking his head.</i>

1169
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:57,363
<i>About dream girls, he doesn't care.
I mention the underwear thing...</i>

1170
01:16:57,363 --> 01:16:59,155
<i>he has a fucking conniption.</i>

1171
01:16:59,157 --> 01:17:01,400
<i>And you?
How about it, filmgoer?</i>

1172
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:05,996
<i>Have you solved the case
of the dead people in L.A.?</i>

1173
01:17:05,997 --> 01:17:08,748
<i>Times Square audiences,
don't shout at the screen.</i>

1174
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:11,661
<i>And stop picking at that,
it'll just get worse.</i>

1175
01:17:14,005 --> 01:17:17,167
- This won't take a second.
- Right.

1176
01:17:29,813 --> 01:17:32,689
Hi. How are you doing tonight?

1177
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,850
They gave away my crickets.

1178
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:43,074
Excuse me, you wouldn't, by chance,
happen to have seen this woman?

1179
01:17:43,076 --> 01:17:47,121
No. I don't like him.
Kurt Cobain, he took my cricket.

1180
01:17:47,122 --> 01:17:48,706
Of course. That's sad.

1181
01:17:48,707 --> 01:17:52,208
Ma'am, I hope you won't be offended
when I ask you...

1182
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:55,837
if you're wearing anything at all
underneath your hospital blues.

1183
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:59,708
Any undergarments. It's important.

1184
01:18:12,439 --> 01:18:15,149
That's the clue.
Veronica Dexter was a patient here.

1185
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:18,853
Private mental clinic,
where even nice girls don't wear undies.

1186
01:18:18,862 --> 01:18:22,155
How could she be here and meanwhile,
she's out having parties?

1187
01:18:22,157 --> 01:18:24,661
Think. First she hates
her dad, then loves him.

1188
01:18:24,662 --> 01:18:26,529
Has a lawsuit, withdraws it.
Why?

1189
01:18:26,536 --> 01:18:29,029
- I'll tell you why.
- Oh, my God.

1190
01:18:32,667 --> 01:18:35,293
Oh, my God.
So it's two different girls, right?

1191
01:18:35,295 --> 01:18:36,855
He stashed his daughter in here,

1192
01:18:36,856 --> 01:18:39,041
and then he put
the ringer on the street.

1193
01:18:39,048 --> 01:18:42,377
He needs someone who looks like her
to withdraw the complaint.

1194
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:44,671
- It's been 10 years.
- This is nuts.

1195
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:47,222
- It's right out of a Gossamer book.
- Of course...

1196
01:18:47,224 --> 01:18:50,266
because the guy who planned
the crimes has all the books.

1197
01:18:50,268 --> 01:18:52,655
He's read them all.
They're in his house.

1198
01:18:52,657 --> 01:18:54,979
Plus, he was in that piece of shit...

1199
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,932
movie.

1200
01:18:57,692 --> 01:18:59,810
You're telling me the girl imposter...

1201
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:02,154
A desperate man needs
a replacement daughter.

1202
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:04,399
Along comes a girl, Harmony's sister.

1203
01:19:04,407 --> 01:19:06,442
Fresh off the bus,
looking for her dad.

1204
01:19:06,443 --> 01:19:08,284
I'd say I found my imposter.

1205
01:19:08,286 --> 01:19:10,654
Let's get out of here.

1206
01:19:12,373 --> 01:19:15,577
- So where did she go from here?
- Shut up, I'm thinking.

1207
01:19:15,585 --> 01:19:17,211
By the way, this thing:

1208
01:19:17,212 --> 01:19:19,413
Single gayest thing you've ever done.

1209
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,507
- Evening, gentlemen.
- Hi, we are so incredibly lost.

1210
01:19:22,509 --> 01:19:24,377
Mr. Van Shrike, hello.

1211
01:19:24,386 --> 01:19:26,921
You look chilly. Come back inside.

1212
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:29,631
I'm from back East.
I'm kind of digging the cold.

1213
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:33,636
- Fuck! He's the one who said it.
- Or I can kill you here.

1214
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:40,900
Harry, I was thinking some more
about this reality versus fiction.

1215
01:19:40,902 --> 01:19:45,981
Like in the movies, when a guy sticks
a gun at some schmuck's back and says:

1216
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:47,905
"Let's take a walk."
He's got a hostage.

1217
01:19:47,907 --> 01:19:49,284
I've seen that movie.

1218
01:19:49,286 --> 01:19:52,954
In reality, the pros like about
five feet of separation.

1219
01:19:52,956 --> 01:19:57,034
That's so the schmuck doesn't take
the gun back and make him eat it.

1220
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:02,457
Doesn't that suck?
I just hit you for no reason.

1221
01:20:02,465 --> 01:20:04,876
Watch it.

1222
01:20:09,889 --> 01:20:12,725
- Tell us where Harmony is.
- Fuck you, Mary.

1223
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:16,011
You don't get it, do you?
This isn't "good cop, bad cop."

1224
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:19,856
This is fag and New Yorker.
You're in a lot of trouble.

1225
01:20:19,858 --> 01:20:24,604
For chrissake, who are you protecting?
It's all over. Dexter is going down.

1226
01:20:24,612 --> 01:20:27,064
- Down.
- I know about Veronica's lawsuit.

1227
01:20:27,073 --> 01:20:30,492
I know Dexter was facing ruin.
I even know he switched daughters.

1228
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:34,029
Which, for God's sake, actually
did work for a while, till last week.

1229
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:36,789
- Then he had to kill her, huh?
- Put a sock in it.

1230
01:20:36,791 --> 01:20:39,292
- I'm asking a question.
- If you ask questions...

1231
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:42,128
then it seems like
we don't know anything. Okay?

1232
01:20:42,130 --> 01:20:45,250
And for the record, it was the
boyfriend, the guy from Paris.

1233
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:49,052
He would've spotted the fake and said,
"That's not Veronica." Am I right?

1234
01:20:49,054 --> 01:20:51,346
- Fuck you!
- Exactly.

1235
01:20:51,347 --> 01:20:54,175
So Dexter had Veronica killed,
threw a dress on her...

1236
01:20:54,184 --> 01:20:57,845
dumped the body and walked away
clean, except for one little thing.

1237
01:20:57,854 --> 01:21:01,224
- Underpants.
- One tiny little pair of undies.

1238
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:02,891
Yeah.

1239
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:07,104
You think that's funny, huh?
I'm gonna break your nose now.

1240
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:11,240
I want you to picture a bullet inside
your head. Can you do that for me?

1241
01:21:11,242 --> 01:21:13,284
Fuck you.

1242
01:21:13,286 --> 01:21:16,204
- Anyway, that's ambiguous.
- Ambiguous? I don't think so.

1243
01:21:16,206 --> 01:21:18,998
He means when you say,
"Picture it inside your head"...

1244
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,502
is that "a bullet
will be inside your head"...

1245
01:21:21,502 --> 01:21:24,505
or "picture it in your head"?
- Harry, will you shut up.

1246
01:21:24,506 --> 01:21:27,841
I don't know anything about a girl,
seriously. I was bluffing.

1247
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:30,359
I think that you are
bluffing right now.

1248
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:32,261
Harry, what are you doing?

1249
01:21:32,262 --> 01:21:34,756
What I'm doing for the guy
who likes to bluff...

1250
01:21:34,765 --> 01:21:40,345
is I'm playing a little game called
"Am I Bluffing?" Where is she?

1251
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:43,181
Where the fuck is Harmony?
You want to play hardball?

1252
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:46,144
Where is the girl?

1253
01:21:46,444 --> 01:21:48,229
What did you just do?

1254
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:51,864
- I just put in one bullet, didn't I?
- You put a live round in that gun?

1255
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:54,827
Yeah, there was like
an 8 percent chance.

1256
01:21:54,828 --> 01:21:58,614
- Eight? Who taught you math?
- Maybe it was more. I don't know...

1257
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:00,992
Shit!

1258
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:03,585
<i>- Hello?
- Perry, is that you?</i>

1259
01:22:03,586 --> 01:22:05,787
<i>- Hey, it's me.
- Hi, Harmony.</i>

1260
01:22:05,796 --> 01:22:07,713
- What's <i>going</i> on?
- Where are you?

1261
01:22:07,715 --> 01:22:09,382
<i>- At home.
- You're at home?</i>

1262
01:22:09,384 --> 01:22:12,594
I just got back. I was in the Hills
all day. Shitty reception.

1263
01:22:12,595 --> 01:22:16,090
- You don't sound so good.
- Why aren't you following your lead?

1264
01:22:16,099 --> 01:22:18,301
Oh, forget it. It's just crazy.

1265
01:22:18,309 --> 01:22:20,386
No, it's not crazy. Listen...

1266
01:22:20,395 --> 01:22:23,972
<i>- It's right out of a Gossamer book.</i>
- Don't talk. Listen.

1267
01:22:23,981 --> 01:22:26,315
- Eight percent.
- And you, stop multiplying.

1268
01:22:26,317 --> 01:22:29,194
No, not you. Listen, call downtown...

1269
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:32,155
see if Veronica Dexter's body
has gone to the mortuary.

1270
01:22:32,157 --> 01:22:34,699
<i>If it has, see if there's
a cremation scheduled.</i>

1271
01:22:34,701 --> 01:22:38,029
- Wait, Perry.
- Call me back right away.

1272
01:22:40,457 --> 01:22:43,408
Look, he was gonna kill you anyway.
He said so.

1273
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:49,122
Cover him up. I'll get the car.

1274
01:22:51,592 --> 01:22:53,814
All right, that's
pretty much all done.

1275
01:22:53,815 --> 01:22:54,720
Harry...

1276
01:22:54,720 --> 01:23:00,051
I got an idea. I say we take
the son of a bitch Dexter down.

1277
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:05,521
To the racetrack and buy
the son of a gun a drink.

1278
01:23:05,523 --> 01:23:10,359
What do you say, Perry?
Oh, fuck, no fair. No fucking fair.

1279
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:13,814
Aurelio, give Mr. Van Shrike
a little pat down.

1280
01:23:21,622 --> 01:23:24,367
Fucking maricón.

1281
01:23:27,587 --> 01:23:30,247
Toss it here. Let's see who it is.

1282
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:34,127
We're in trouble. Dexter's got us.

1283
01:23:38,597 --> 01:23:41,300
He just asked a carpet-cleaning service
to save him.

1284
01:23:41,684 --> 01:23:44,345
Sorry, kid. Good hands, though.

1285
01:23:44,354 --> 01:23:47,597
Thanks. Used to be a magician.

1286
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:52,694
And for 39.99 we'll carpet
up to three rooms in half the time.

1287
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:56,356
That's a $40 value. Act today.

1288
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:02,578
That chick in the casket,
she won't even match up with that...

1289
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:05,791
ringer you been toting around.
You ever think about that?

1290
01:24:05,792 --> 01:24:08,618
He did, Harry.
That's why he's cremating the body.

1291
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:11,788
Yeah, you ready?

1292
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:16,467
Speak of the devil. Gotta go.

1293
01:24:16,469 --> 01:24:20,256
Perry, nice to have known you.

1294
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:22,515
- Harry.
- Harry. Yes, of course.

1295
01:24:22,516 --> 01:24:24,092
Harry from New York.

1296
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:28,430
I hope you don't judge Los Angeles
based solely on your experience tonight.

1297
01:24:35,988 --> 01:24:38,823
I'm kind of scared here, Perry.

1298
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:41,368
Aurelio, why don't you give
the kid a break?

1299
01:24:41,368 --> 01:24:44,078
Do unto others and all that.
It's Christmas.

1300
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:46,448
- Who else knows?
- I don't know anything.

1301
01:24:46,457 --> 01:24:48,909
I'm not even from here, you fuck-up.

1302
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:03,640
Mr. Dexter, the coffin's good to go.

1303
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:06,551
Okay, let's burn the bitch.

1304
01:25:09,271 --> 01:25:11,556
You could zap his chest.
It'd be easier.

1305
01:25:11,565 --> 01:25:13,734
But we know why you gotta do
it down there.

1306
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:16,110
You like looking at his johnson,
don't you?

1307
01:25:16,112 --> 01:25:18,104
Admit it, dude, you got it in you.

1308
01:25:21,242 --> 01:25:25,947
Enough! Look me in the eyes and
tell me you've never been with a man.

1309
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:29,367
- Fuck you, maricón! Fuck you!
- That's what you want, isn't it?

1310
01:25:29,375 --> 01:25:32,703
- You want to fuck me.
- Stop helping. Stop helping.

1311
01:25:32,712 --> 01:25:35,622
- If you are not gay, just say so.
- Fuck you, maricón!

1312
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:39,710
- Look at him. He can't even say it.
- Stop helping!

1313
01:25:39,719 --> 01:25:42,505
- Can't wait to have you as a patient.
- Bet you can't.

1314
01:25:42,512 --> 01:25:44,631
- This is what you want. Here.
- Shut up!

1315
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,844
Take a look. You want some of this
right here? Look at this.

1316
01:25:47,851 --> 01:25:49,261
Just shut up!

1317
01:25:52,899 --> 01:25:54,684
Yeah!

1318
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:59,814
Homophobes never check there.

1319
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:04,944
Thank God you had a gun in there.
I thought it was a gay thing...

1320
01:26:04,952 --> 01:26:07,871
like somehow
you guys could do that. Sorry.

1321
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:11,117
- Are you okay?
- Not really, no.

1322
01:26:11,292 --> 01:26:14,119
Gentlemen, let's wrap it up
and get out of here.

1323
01:26:16,213 --> 01:26:19,632
- Who's driving?
- I tell you what, I'll flip you for it.

1324
01:26:19,634 --> 01:26:21,668
All right.

1325
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:28,175
- This way, come on.
- Shit!

1326
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:36,692
<i>- Yeah.
- Hey, Harmony, it's me.</i>

1327
01:26:36,693 --> 01:26:38,895
Oh, God, how did you get away?

1328
01:26:38,903 --> 01:26:41,771
I shot him with a small revolver
I keep near my balls.

1329
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:45,742
I can't get to my car. We're near Olive
and the freeway. Can you pick us up?

1330
01:26:45,743 --> 01:26:48,779
<i>I'm in a van with the body.
I'll be there in 30 seconds.</i>

1331
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:51,698
All right, be where I can see you.
Be ready to move.

1332
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:56,828
Shit, they're on my tail. I gotta go.

1333
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:11,344
Right there. She's right there! Shit.

1334
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:20,519
Harmony!

1335
01:27:37,587 --> 01:27:39,913
Harmony!

1336
01:27:55,354 --> 01:27:57,430
- Harmony!
- Harry, don't!

1337
01:28:25,926 --> 01:28:30,006
Come on, we gotta go. They're coming
back around. Harmony's down there.

1338
01:28:32,182 --> 01:28:35,845
Perry, what's wrong?

1339
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:39,305
Come on, breathe.

1340
01:28:53,996 --> 01:28:56,157
Harry.

1341
01:29:01,921 --> 01:29:03,831
Harold.

1342
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:30,065
<i>Harold...</i>

1343
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:33,735
use your awesome might.

1344
01:29:33,743 --> 01:29:37,448
<i>Save me from this hopeless plight.</i>

1345
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:41,534
<i>Harold...</i>

1346
01:30:31,801 --> 01:30:33,546
Harmony!

1347
01:30:45,899 --> 01:30:49,728
Captain Fucking Magic.

1348
01:30:55,368 --> 01:30:56,985
Come on!

1349
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:10,666
No.

1350
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:21,594
There, all done.

1351
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:24,846
Finished.

1352
01:31:34,073 --> 01:31:35,858
Harry.

1353
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:41,787
- Did you call me?
- Harry, you're shot.

1354
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:44,408
No, no. Look, you want
to see something cool?

1355
01:31:46,877 --> 01:31:50,788
Cool! This stopped the bullet, Harry.

1356
01:31:57,887 --> 01:32:00,298
No, not really.

1357
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:02,635
Oh, Harry.

1358
01:32:02,643 --> 01:32:05,470
Oh, God, Harry.

1359
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:10,016
Harry.

1360
01:32:19,452 --> 01:32:24,155
- Hi. Welcome back.
- Yeah.

1361
01:32:25,875 --> 01:32:26,832
How many fingers?

1362
01:32:26,833 --> 01:32:29,621
Put that cat down,
because I'm allergic.

1363
01:32:31,087 --> 01:32:34,006
You feeling okay? How's your...?

1364
01:32:34,007 --> 01:32:36,542
- My what?
- Well, your...

1365
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:40,256
- Everything down there.
- I can't believe he told you that.

1366
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:44,885
It's Christmas,
where's my present, Slick?

1367
01:32:44,894 --> 01:32:47,304
Your present is you're not in jail,
fag-hag.

1368
01:32:47,313 --> 01:32:50,230
<i>Yeah, boo, hiss, I know.
Look, I hate it too.</i>

1369
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:53,818
<i>In movies where the studio gets all
paranoid about a downer ending...</i>

1370
01:32:53,819 --> 01:32:57,863
<i>so the guy shows up, he's magically
alive on crutches, I hate that.</i>

1371
01:32:57,864 --> 01:33:01,193
<i>I mean, shit,
why not bring them all back.</i>

1372
01:33:01,952 --> 01:33:06,122
<i>But the point is, in this case,
this time, it really happened.</i>

1373
01:33:06,122 --> 01:33:08,875
<i>Perry, like, lived.
Yeah, it's a dumb movie thing...</i>

1374
01:33:08,876 --> 01:33:11,668
<i>but what do you want me to do,
lie about it?</i>

1375
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:13,630
So you found something out?

1376
01:33:13,631 --> 01:33:16,958
Yeah. But you're not gonna like it.

1377
01:33:18,344 --> 01:33:20,587
Dexter didn't murder your sister.

1378
01:33:21,221 --> 01:33:25,390
That's crazy. He was using my sister
to impersonate his daughter, Perry.

1379
01:33:25,391 --> 01:33:28,304
Never happened.
I talked to my police guy.

1380
01:33:29,479 --> 01:33:35,680
The ringer was a girl named Mia Frye,
23-year-old from Glendale.

1381
01:33:35,903 --> 01:33:38,488
When she wasn't impersonating
Veronica Dexter...

1382
01:33:38,488 --> 01:33:40,899
she wore a pink wig.

1383
01:33:42,743 --> 01:33:47,363
But my sister sent you up
to Big Bear Lake, to his cabin.

1384
01:33:48,666 --> 01:33:52,828
Your sister was convinced
that Dexter was her natural father...

1385
01:33:52,837 --> 01:33:55,538
so she started following him,
hanging around.

1386
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:58,250
Do you see where I'm going with this?

1387
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:01,594
One day your sister came calling,
and she saw Dexter...

1388
01:34:01,595 --> 01:34:03,713
in bed with the pink-haired girl.

1389
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:06,557
What she thought
was father and daughter.

1390
01:34:06,559 --> 01:34:08,976
Remember,
that's how it would appear.

1391
01:34:08,978 --> 01:34:10,561
It was too much for her.

1392
01:34:10,563 --> 01:34:15,184
First the old father,
now the shiny new one.

1393
01:34:15,192 --> 01:34:20,355
She couldn't handle it,
and she took her own life.

1394
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:25,027
What she hired me to film
wasn't murder, but incest.

1395
01:34:27,246 --> 01:34:29,497
I'm sorry.

1396
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:31,666
<i>So much for unreality.</i>

1397
01:34:31,667 --> 01:34:33,327
<i>I said goodbye...</i>

1398
01:34:33,543 --> 01:34:37,296
<i>watched Jonny's world
go back on the fiction shelf.</i>

1399
01:34:37,297 --> 01:34:40,083
<i>But while it lasted, brother...</i>

1400
01:34:40,717 --> 01:34:42,961
<i>it was one for the books.</i>

1401
01:34:44,054 --> 01:34:46,798
You should've told me
you were arrested five times.

1402
01:34:47,307 --> 01:34:49,016
I should be pissed.

1403
01:34:49,018 --> 01:34:52,854
You should have told me that when you
go home, you put on lady's underpants.

1404
01:34:52,854 --> 01:34:55,105
- That's cross-dressing, imbecile.
- Whatever.

1405
01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:58,984
Half those guys are straight.
Perfect fathers, love their kids.

1406
01:34:58,985 --> 01:35:01,195
How about you?
Did your father love you?

1407
01:35:01,197 --> 01:35:05,365
Sometimes. You know, when I dressed
up like a bottle. How about yours?

1408
01:35:05,367 --> 01:35:08,569
Well, he used to beat me in Morse code,
so it's possible...

1409
01:35:08,578 --> 01:35:11,122
but he never
actually said the words.

1410
01:35:11,122 --> 01:35:13,582
- Harry.
- What?

1411
01:35:13,583 --> 01:35:16,119
Don't steal any more shit.

1412
01:35:16,878 --> 01:35:19,081
You're not a punk.

1413
01:35:22,592 --> 01:35:24,086
You bet I'll turn around.

1414
01:35:24,345 --> 01:35:25,802
You like that, huh?

1415
01:35:25,804 --> 01:35:29,224
I saw him in the commissary twice.
What is he, like 6'4"?

1416
01:35:29,225 --> 01:35:32,518
He doesn't know he's gay.
Look how he walks.

1417
01:35:32,519 --> 01:35:34,311
<i>So that's pretty much that.</i>

1418
01:35:34,313 --> 01:35:37,474
<i>We went back to Indiana,
the three of us, for Jenna's funeral.</i>

1419
01:35:38,943 --> 01:35:41,319
<i>Don't worry,
I saw the last Lord of the</i> Rings.

1420
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:43,238
<i>I won't have the movie end 17 times.</i>

1421
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:46,315
<i>There is, though, one final scene
for your viewing pleasure.</i>

1422
01:35:55,792 --> 01:35:58,036
Do I know you?

1423
01:36:01,923 --> 01:36:04,710
No. Just in town for the funeral.

1424
01:36:04,969 --> 01:36:06,502
What do you want?

1425
01:36:06,511 --> 01:36:10,841
The zoo was closed, so I thought
I'd come here and look at an animal.

1426
01:36:10,849 --> 01:36:12,516
Son of a...

1427
01:36:12,518 --> 01:36:15,520
Who do you think you're talking to?

1428
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,015
I buried my daughter today.

1429
01:36:18,023 --> 01:36:20,350
No.

1430
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:23,604
You buried her 20 years ago.

1431
01:36:23,612 --> 01:36:27,823
Harmony was right,
her sister was murdered.

1432
01:36:27,824 --> 01:36:31,987
You pulled the trigger. It just took
this long for the bullet to hit.

1433
01:36:32,662 --> 01:36:35,073
Who are you?

1434
01:36:35,957 --> 01:36:38,034
I loved my girl.

1435
01:36:38,752 --> 01:36:42,380
You fucker!
If I could get out of this bed...

1436
01:36:42,381 --> 01:36:46,001
Yeah? Well, you can't.

1437
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:49,253
You bastard!

1438
01:36:52,557 --> 01:36:55,260
An old man that can't defend himself.

1439
01:36:55,269 --> 01:36:57,270
Big tough guy.

1440
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:58,805
Yeah, that's right.

1441
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:02,684
Big tough guy.

1442
01:37:16,206 --> 01:37:21,578
<i>I prefer Genaros, but what do I know?
I'm a bear. I suck the heads off fish.</i>

1443
01:37:29,761 --> 01:37:33,722
That's it. That's the true story
of what happened last Christmas.

1444
01:37:33,724 --> 01:37:37,560
That was some pretty harsh shit
with the old guy back there, right?

1445
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:40,688
But whatever, he's creepy.
Fuck him. Don't worry about him.

1446
01:37:40,689 --> 01:37:43,024
Anyhow, so...

1447
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:44,900
Thanks for coming.

1448
01:37:44,902 --> 01:37:48,646
Thanks for taking the trip to L.A.
with me.

1449
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:51,615
If I had to sum it up,
and I do...

1450
01:37:51,617 --> 01:37:54,202
Because, you know,
it's, like, the end.

1451
01:37:54,203 --> 01:37:58,872
...I would say that this movie is about...
It's about friendship.

1452
01:37:58,873 --> 01:38:01,250
- Friendship is sacred.
- What are you doing?

1453
01:38:01,251 --> 01:38:03,127
I'm trying to wrap up the movie...

1454
01:38:03,127 --> 01:38:05,622
...and leave the people
with a message.

1455
01:38:06,297 --> 01:38:09,550
I've got a message for you.
Get your feet off my fucking desk.

1456
01:38:09,551 --> 01:38:11,802
