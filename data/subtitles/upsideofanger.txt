1
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,886
A case in point in anger's ability
to change us, is my mother.

2
00:00:54,165 --> 00:00:56,566
My mother was always
the nicest person I ever knew.

3
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,801
She was the nicest, sweetest woman
than anyone who knew her ever knew.

4
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,105
Then things changed...

5
00:01:07,143 --> 00:01:08,974
then she changed.

6
00:01:09,012 --> 00:01:12,344
She got angry.
Good and angry.

7
00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:26,853
Anger has turned my mother
into a very sad and bitter woman.

8
00:01:29,563 --> 00:01:31,623
If she wasn't my mother,
I'd slap her.

9
00:01:31,665 --> 00:01:33,793
I would.

10
00:01:33,835 --> 00:01:37,463
I'd look her straight in the face and
tell her what I really think of her...

11
00:01:37,504 --> 00:01:41,372
and then I'd run really fast
in the opposite direction.

12
00:02:20,243 --> 00:02:22,872
- Are you eating?
- Yes.

13
00:02:22,913 --> 00:02:25,312
I want you eating.
I mean it.

14
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,109
Okay.

15
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:34,247
You ladies
are old enough now,

16
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:36,257
I'm not gonna pull
any punches here.

17
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,259
He took his wallet...

18
00:02:38,293 --> 00:02:40,260
and he left.

19
00:02:40,295 --> 00:02:42,263
When he didn't come home
the other night,

20
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:44,264
you know,
I thought we got lucky

21
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:46,265
and he was just
in a car crash,

22
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,563
dead by the side of the road,
but the fact is,

23
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:52,230
he's run off with his little Swedish
secretary, who, oh, what a coincidence,

24
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,264
mysteriously left work three days ago
and moved back to Sweden!

25
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:01,907
But where did he go?
Have you spoken to him?

26
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,915
No, I haven't
spoken to him.

27
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:06,144
There is
very little to say.

28
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:09,153
He knows that. But I did cut off
all his goddamn credit cards.

29
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:11,587
Closed his checking
account, yeah.

30
00:03:11,622 --> 00:03:13,614
See how long she sticks
around when he's broke.

31
00:03:13,658 --> 00:03:16,421
Your father is a...

32
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:18,451
small man.

33
00:03:19,463 --> 00:03:21,295
Very small.

34
00:03:21,331 --> 00:03:24,460
I hope that's not an allusion
to the man's genitals

35
00:03:24,502 --> 00:03:26,936
- 'cause that'd just be gross.
- Aw, dude,

36
00:03:26,971 --> 00:03:29,131
- I was about to eat a string bean.
- Oh, my god...

37
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:31,731
Excuse me, excuse me.
Everything is not a joke.

38
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:33,765
I am talking.

39
00:03:44,086 --> 00:03:47,453
And as a jittery
nation worries

40
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,356
about a counterstrike, we'll go to the
scene of the anthrax scare in Florida.

41
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,192
Sheesh.

42
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:15,646
Hey.
Hey, Terry.

43
00:04:15,681 --> 00:04:17,649
What do you want?

44
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:19,651
Well, I, I...

45
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:21,653
I wanted to talk
to you and Grey

46
00:04:21,687 --> 00:04:24,052
about them building that
subdivision back there?

47
00:04:24,088 --> 00:04:26,057
- Yeah?
- He's so, um...

48
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:28,059
He's so damned set
against it,

49
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:30,060
he hasn't even heard
the proposal.

50
00:04:30,095 --> 00:04:32,062
Grey doesn't
live here anymore, Denny.

51
00:04:32,096 --> 00:04:34,064
He doesn't exist.

52
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:36,088
Go away.

53
00:04:41,372 --> 00:04:43,932
Officials tell us
that they are worried

54
00:04:43,973 --> 00:04:47,170
about how to manage the fragile US-led
coalition in the days ahead,

55
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:49,939
but the facts
are already evident

56
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:52,173
from south Asia, to Africa,
to the Middle East.

57
00:04:52,213 --> 00:04:55,240
Worldwide, thousands
of angry demonstrators

58
00:04:55,283 --> 00:04:58,151
are taking to the streets
to protest US military...

59
00:04:58,187 --> 00:05:01,314
The least he could have done
was taken this stupid jock with him.

60
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:04,415
There have been plenty
of protests in the world.

61
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:06,120
and I suspect...

62
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:09,129
Ugh.

63
00:05:09,163 --> 00:05:11,130
What... what...

64
00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:13,723
what do you mean,
"He doesn't exist"?

65
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:16,257
Oh.

66
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:19,538
Are you stoned?

67
00:05:19,572 --> 00:05:22,735
- Yeah.
- Oh... Jesus.

68
00:05:22,776 --> 00:05:24,744
What do you...
what do you mean,

69
00:05:24,778 --> 00:05:26,404
"He... he doesn't exist"?

70
00:05:26,446 --> 00:05:28,572
He's been messing around
with his assistant.

71
00:05:28,615 --> 00:05:30,582
Go talk about it
on the radio.

72
00:05:30,617 --> 00:05:32,913
No, I'm... I'm...
no, I'm, I'm... I'm, I'm be...

73
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:35,283
I'm being serious.
I need... I need to talk to him.

74
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:38,721
Um...

75
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,747
He left me.

76
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,651
- He left you?
- Mm. For Danken Shane

77
00:05:44,696 --> 00:05:46,663
or whatever his
secretary's name is,

78
00:05:46,697 --> 00:05:49,360
so Denny you can go ahead
and build your...

79
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,367
damn subdivision
back there...

80
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:53,369
I don't know,
whatever it is you want.

81
00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:55,836
It was him who had the
problem with it, not me, okay?

82
00:05:57,406 --> 00:05:59,374
- He left you?
- Yes.

83
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:01,399
- Really?
- Yeah.

84
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:07,238
Hey, I'm sorry,
Terry.

85
00:06:10,086 --> 00:06:12,884
You know, go ahead and build
your houses back there, Denny.

86
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:15,389
- He's gone. He won't stop...
- They're not my houses.

87
00:06:15,423 --> 00:06:17,389
They're not.
I'm just, um...

88
00:06:17,423 --> 00:06:19,721
I'm just the front man,
you know,

89
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,454
wave the
World Series ring.

90
00:06:21,495 --> 00:06:24,952
They get the sales,
I'm getting a free lot out of it.

91
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:26,966
Ooh, a free lot.

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,992
- Hmm.
- It's something Shep set up.

93
00:06:34,108 --> 00:06:37,132
He really left?
Really?

94
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:39,143
This is... true?

95
00:06:39,177 --> 00:06:41,168
Yeah.

96
00:06:43,314 --> 00:06:45,942
Hey, come on.
Just go away.

97
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:56,750
Hey. Well... ah... look,
let me come in.

98
00:06:57,961 --> 00:06:59,826
Come on, if yo...
if you don't want,

99
00:06:59,863 --> 00:07:02,194
I won't talk. I'll just sit there
and I'll drink with you.

100
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,867
There was a large mob...

101
00:07:06,903 --> 00:07:08,870
of angry demonstrators
here today,

102
00:07:08,904 --> 00:07:11,930
proving that a number of people
are willing to go and fight.

103
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:14,807
- The feeling is that...
- I got her to school.

104
00:07:14,843 --> 00:07:16,778
Thank you.

105
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:19,042
You know I'm going back
to school in the morning,

106
00:07:19,081 --> 00:07:21,173
you're gonna get her
yourself tomorrow.

107
00:07:38,231 --> 00:07:41,098
Billy Edwards on my bus says
that when you get really drunk,

108
00:07:41,134 --> 00:07:44,365
you get friendly and you sign baseballs
without bitching about it.

109
00:07:46,538 --> 00:07:48,529
- He does?
- Yeah.

110
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:52,603
So, you got any
baseballs around?

111
00:07:52,644 --> 00:07:54,875
No.

112
00:07:56,382 --> 00:07:58,441
Why don't you run down
the street to my house.

113
00:07:58,483 --> 00:08:00,451
I got a...

114
00:08:00,485 --> 00:08:03,886
stack of boxes in my garage.
There's a key under my mat.

115
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:06,982
You grab one of those boxes.
You bring it back here.

116
00:08:08,524 --> 00:08:10,550
One box.

117
00:08:12,362 --> 00:08:14,990
Anything she makes...

118
00:08:15,031 --> 00:08:17,091
I'm gonna split with her.

119
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:30,273
Buddy, Goddamn you!
Out!

120
00:08:30,312 --> 00:08:33,440
What's the big deal? He wasn't licking
it more than three seconds.

121
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:36,918
The three second thing is for floors,
not dogs' mouths.

122
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:39,648
He spends all day
licking other dogs' asses.

123
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,655
Oh, let's just call
for take-out.

124
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,418
It's fine. You guys, it's good chicken.
It's fine.

125
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,926
Like you'd eat it?

126
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,765
It's fine.

127
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:58,066
You know the Zilwaukees'
Great Dane, "Mo'fo?"

128
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,969
You're licking
his asshole right now.

129
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,604
You know what,
that's really sick.

130
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:06,907
How's dinner coming?

131
00:09:06,945 --> 00:09:09,572
Good.
We made your favorite.

132
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,480
- Chicken.
- Thank you.

133
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:14,315
Um, can you make an extra plate?
Denny's staying for dinner.

134
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:16,513
That was quick.

135
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,991
What was quick?

136
00:09:19,264 --> 00:09:21,272
What was quick?

137
00:09:21,993 --> 00:09:23,984
Denny?!

138
00:09:25,361 --> 00:09:27,330
Please...

139
00:09:27,364 --> 00:09:30,230
Give me more credit than that, Hadley.
He's a drunk.

140
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:32,235
You make a nice couple.

141
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:38,673
My life is falling apart
at this moment.

142
00:09:38,706 --> 00:09:42,107
I expect some compassion
from you.

143
00:09:42,144 --> 00:09:44,111
Now you go back up
to school tomorrow,

144
00:09:44,145 --> 00:09:46,544
come back home
at Christmas break

145
00:09:46,581 --> 00:09:48,548
and bust my hump
if you want to,

146
00:09:48,582 --> 00:09:52,144
but right this minute, I want the
benefit of the doubt at every turn!

147
00:09:52,187 --> 00:09:54,154
Are we clear?

148
00:09:54,188 --> 00:09:56,179
Yes.

149
00:09:57,692 --> 00:09:59,682
Thank you.

150
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:07,254
Mm, this looks good.

151
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:17,674
What kind of a dick-head
runs away with his secretary?

152
00:10:17,995 --> 00:10:21,235
That is lame. Take a right,
make a left at pathetic.

153
00:10:22,181 --> 00:10:24,671
I think he's coming
back home.

154
00:10:27,951 --> 00:10:31,011
Maybe not soon,
but... I do.

155
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,158
I think we should
call him.

156
00:10:35,192 --> 00:10:37,159
And say what?

157
00:10:37,193 --> 00:10:39,594
"Hey Dad, how's your
new life going so far?

158
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:41,790
I got an A
in interpretive dance. "

159
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:45,293
He doesn't care about you, Emily.
Get real.

160
00:10:48,171 --> 00:10:50,138
He lost his job, Hadley.

161
00:10:50,172 --> 00:10:53,072
- What?
- Your father was about to be laid off.

162
00:10:53,107 --> 00:10:55,099
He was told
a few months ago.

163
00:10:58,614 --> 00:11:01,105
He was devastated.
He didn't want you girls to know it.

164
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:04,586
Okay? I think he
flipped out or something.

165
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,587
I read this article

166
00:11:06,621 --> 00:11:08,645
on the internet.
Apparently, it's common.

167
00:11:08,688 --> 00:11:10,815
They lose their jobs,
and they go nuts.

168
00:11:10,856 --> 00:11:12,586
What do you want
from me?

169
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,253
It's the best
that I can come up with.

170
00:11:14,293 --> 00:11:16,057
I don't want
anything from you.

171
00:11:16,096 --> 00:11:18,461
Well, don't take it out on me, Hadley.
You aren't gonna have to be here.

172
00:11:18,498 --> 00:11:20,226
You aren't gonna know how
empty this house is gonna be.

173
00:11:20,267 --> 00:11:22,701
Well, if it makes you feel
any better, I hate him too.

174
00:11:22,735 --> 00:11:24,703
Oh, does that mean
you hate me?

175
00:11:24,738 --> 00:11:26,706
You are such a mental.

176
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,730
I have to go, okay?

177
00:11:30,942 --> 00:11:32,932
All right.

178
00:11:34,546 --> 00:11:36,537
I'll see you later,
okay?

179
00:12:01,671 --> 00:12:03,639
Terry.

180
00:12:03,673 --> 00:12:05,264
Hey.

181
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,275
Listen to my show
today, okay?

182
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,302
I'll mention you.

183
00:12:10,346 --> 00:12:12,313
I'm gonna bring you up
as a drinking buddy

184
00:12:12,347 --> 00:12:15,803
- I watched the invasion with.
- I don't want you to do that, Denny.

185
00:12:15,849 --> 00:12:18,078
I know, but...
you don't have a choice.

186
00:12:18,118 --> 00:12:20,518
Yeah, I do. I don't want to be
mentioned on the radio.

187
00:12:21,522 --> 00:12:23,490
You don't want
to be mentioned?

188
00:12:23,524 --> 00:12:25,048
<i>- She cried more, more, more!
- No.</i>

189
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:27,322
<i>With a rebel yell</i>

190
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,385
<i>- She cried more, more, more!
- Okay.</i>

191
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:31,921
Oh, God.

192
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:41,802
Hey, come on!
Slow down!

193
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,671
- There's children playing here!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry!

194
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:45,700
- There's children playing here!
- Sorry!

195
00:13:04,293 --> 00:13:06,591
And now, once again,

196
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:08,597
Detroit's own legendary
Denny Davies.

197
00:13:10,634 --> 00:13:13,659
Okay, it's the
Denny Davies show.

198
00:13:13,702 --> 00:13:15,671
and if you're
a regular listener,

199
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:18,730
and you've just tuned in, you know
that you haven't missed much.

200
00:13:18,774 --> 00:13:21,241
And you know that's the beauty
of the show, right, Shep?

201
00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:24,107
You can always just
jump right in here with us

202
00:13:24,144 --> 00:13:26,544
- because...
- Because nothing ever happens.

203
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:28,548
Nothing ever
happens, exactly

204
00:13:28,582 --> 00:13:31,312
Now what were we talking about
just before the commercial?

205
00:13:31,351 --> 00:13:33,912
Oh yeah.
The invasion, right?

206
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:35,923
- See?
- Right?

207
00:13:35,956 --> 00:13:38,082
- You still do have your memory.
- Yeah.

208
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,592
I know what people are saying.
Were you watching TV?

209
00:13:40,626 --> 00:13:42,595
As a matter of fact,
I was watching it

210
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:44,596
with my drinking buddy
the very sweet,

211
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,597
the very tall
and absolutely sexy

212
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:48,600
Terry Ann Wolfmeyer.

213
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:51,101
But you...
but you know what?

214
00:13:51,136 --> 00:13:53,605
- What? - She doesn't
want me to talk about her,

215
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,698
so I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna talk about her.

216
00:13:56,741 --> 00:13:58,368
Not gonna talk
about who?

217
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:01,139
- Terry Ann Wolfmeyer.
- Terry Ann Wolfmeyer.

218
00:14:01,178 --> 00:14:04,046
I get it. We're not even mentioning
Terry Ann Wolfmeyer's name.

219
00:14:04,081 --> 00:14:06,606
- Nope.
- Is that the game that you're playing?

220
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,447
- Not even gonna bring her up.
- Terry Ann Wolfmeyer.

221
00:14:09,485 --> 00:14:12,886
- You're getting no play.
- On 101 WRIF Detroit.

222
00:14:12,923 --> 00:14:15,083
You're listening to
the Denny Davies show.

223
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,094
What I don't get, is how come
you won't talk about baseball?

224
00:14:18,128 --> 00:14:20,924
With all they pay you every year,
what's with you not talking about base...

225
00:14:20,962 --> 00:14:23,363
Hey, guess what,
guess what, pinhead?

226
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,366
They don't pay me
that much.

227
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,767
He just got flushed.

228
00:14:29,538 --> 00:14:31,903
Okay, that's...

229
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,908
that's it for me folks,
the Poobah's up next,

230
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:35,909
Big Daddy Arthur P.

231
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:38,412
But I'll be with you tomorrow,
and you can all call in

232
00:14:38,447 --> 00:14:41,846
give me hell, the radio equivalent
of dunking the clown...

233
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,850
into the water.

234
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,851
WRIF Detroit at 5:00...

235
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,716
That wasn't too bad,
was it, Shep?

236
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,552
Wasn't too... vicious?

237
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,615
No, you were mild today. You probably
only lost about 6 or 7,000 listeners.

238
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:54,717
You should feel really
good about yourself.

239
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,251
- WRIF or email the Poobah
at Arthur P...

240
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,230
Hey, but what was
all that about?

241
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:01,629
- All what?
- That whole thing about the woman

242
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,634
you watched the invasion
with? Who's she?

243
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:05,636
Just a girl.

244
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,969
Yeah, she's one of the
20-year-olds, isn't she?

245
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:10,440
From the college thing.
The one I got you.

246
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:12,443
No.

247
00:15:12,477 --> 00:15:14,707
No, she's not 20.
She's nowhere near 20.

248
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:17,374
In fact, look,
don't superimpose

249
00:15:17,414 --> 00:15:19,383
your warped thinking
onto my life, okay?

250
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:20,884
I got enough problems.

251
00:15:20,918 --> 00:15:22,884
Okay, well,
then while we're at it,

252
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:24,886
don't knock my
dating habits, okay?

253
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:26,889
'Cause they keep me young.

254
00:15:26,923 --> 00:15:30,450
I happen to be a walking encyclopedia
of every boy-band that ever existed.

255
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:33,394
Trust me, you don't get that
from dating Arianna Huffington.

256
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:37,024
Did you, uh, find out about that, uh,
mall opening in Toledo?

257
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:39,899
- What it's price was?
- Yeah, $10,000.

258
00:15:39,934 --> 00:15:41,994
$10,000 for you
to show up

259
00:15:42,037 --> 00:15:44,937
for one-half an hour.

260
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:47,338
- You know, it must suck for you...
- You're going.

261
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:50,173
...not, uh, being me.
- Yeah, almost as much as it must suck

262
00:15:50,211 --> 00:15:52,576
- actually being you.
- And now, your Rock 'n' Roll

263
00:15:52,614 --> 00:15:54,844
- radio chaperone of Detroit...
- Go home.

264
00:15:54,883 --> 00:15:58,341
Seriously. I've got a real
disc jockey to produce.

265
00:15:58,385 --> 00:16:00,410
A die-hard drinking fan with
a serious football problem.

266
00:16:00,455 --> 00:16:02,615
My impression of you
in about 15 minutes.

267
00:16:02,655 --> 00:16:05,817
...WRIF Detroit.

268
00:16:05,857 --> 00:16:08,190
That was said with love.

269
00:16:48,864 --> 00:16:50,831
Where's Mom?

270
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:54,096
She's upstairs
taking a shower.

271
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,804
What are you working on?

272
00:17:03,846 --> 00:17:05,746
What are you looking
in the want-ads for?

273
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,770
A job.

274
00:17:09,281 --> 00:17:11,375
I need to work.
I'm not going to college.

275
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:13,409
Okay.

276
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:16,355
It's okay with me,
I guess.

277
00:17:16,388 --> 00:17:18,413
Thank you.

278
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,653
- What are you gonna do?
- I want to be a reporter.

279
00:17:20,693 --> 00:17:23,788
- A newscaster.
- Well, you have the face for it.

280
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:29,567
Oh. Are you staying
for dinner?

281
00:17:29,602 --> 00:17:32,661
Depends.

282
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:34,933
If you're making any more
of that chicken, I am.

283
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:01,195
Here you go.

284
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,892
A little something to get
you into second gear.

285
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:05,901
What are you doing?

286
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:08,300
I wasn't looking, relax.

287
00:18:08,336 --> 00:18:10,394
Get out!
Jesus!

288
00:18:10,438 --> 00:18:13,270
I get out, I'm taking
this drink with me.

289
00:18:13,307 --> 00:18:15,366
Have you ever heard
of boundaries?

290
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,376
Okay, that's it.

291
00:18:17,411 --> 00:18:19,402
I'm drinking them both.

292
00:18:21,281 --> 00:18:23,272
Give me the drink.

293
00:18:25,752 --> 00:18:27,721
I, I wasn't looking.

294
00:18:27,755 --> 00:18:29,746
All right?
I, uh...

295
00:18:31,157 --> 00:18:33,147
I didn't see much.

296
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:37,118
All right, well...
what are you doing here?

297
00:18:37,163 --> 00:18:39,686
- What do you want?
- Well, little Emily invited me...

298
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,163
for dinner.

299
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:43,792
- She did?
- Yes, she did,

300
00:18:43,835 --> 00:18:46,565
and I think you know
my position on free food.

301
00:18:53,978 --> 00:18:55,969
Which one of you
recites Brownie?

302
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,980
Come on, your mother
told me once that one of you

303
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:05,180
recites Brownie,
beautifully.

304
00:19:06,423 --> 00:19:08,391
Oh.
Browning,

305
00:19:08,424 --> 00:19:11,291
Elizabeth Barrett Browning
and I was telling you that...

306
00:19:11,327 --> 00:19:13,296
um... Popeye,
a few years back

307
00:19:13,329 --> 00:19:15,626
when you were like,
I don't know, nine or 10 or so.

308
00:19:15,663 --> 00:19:17,393
I had her read Browning
and she used to

309
00:19:17,432 --> 00:19:19,059
commit some of the
poems to memory

310
00:19:19,101 --> 00:19:21,068
and recite them here
at the dinner table.

311
00:19:21,103 --> 00:19:23,070
That's right.

312
00:19:23,105 --> 00:19:25,071
That's what it was.
That sounds...

313
00:19:25,105 --> 00:19:27,074
that sounds good.

314
00:19:27,107 --> 00:19:29,076
I've never heard anything
like it before

315
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:31,077
but it...
it sounds fun.

316
00:19:31,112 --> 00:19:33,079
To who?

317
00:19:33,114 --> 00:19:35,273
To all of us,
if she can remember.

318
00:19:37,284 --> 00:19:39,275
Popeye?

319
00:19:42,189 --> 00:19:44,656
Can we do this tomorrow
night when I've had notice

320
00:19:44,691 --> 00:19:47,089
and can make plans
to eat somewhere else?

321
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,116
I don't remember any
of them anyway.

322
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,897
I do.

323
00:19:52,932 --> 00:19:54,900
- You do?
- Yeah.

324
00:19:54,933 --> 00:19:58,198
Really?
Wow.

325
00:19:58,236 --> 00:19:59,863
I'm impressed.

326
00:19:59,903 --> 00:20:02,236
Good.
You should be.

327
00:20:11,347 --> 00:20:13,316
What's so funny?

328
00:20:14,317 --> 00:20:16,286
Nothing.
Just...

329
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:18,309
You're just all...
I don't know...

330
00:20:19,654 --> 00:20:21,645
very female.

331
00:20:38,806 --> 00:20:42,105
I got her number in Sweden...
from Helen Trailer.

332
00:20:42,143 --> 00:20:44,111
It forwards and I...

333
00:20:44,144 --> 00:20:47,740
called last night.

334
00:20:47,781 --> 00:20:50,410
It must've been the middle
of the night there.

335
00:20:50,451 --> 00:20:52,976
It was Grey that answered.
I'm sure of it.

336
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,682
Yeah. I hung up
like a six-year-old.

337
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,493
Ah, he'll marry her.
I'd bet any money in the world.

338
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,659
What do you think
you'll do?

339
00:21:11,702 --> 00:21:13,671
Eh, what can I do?

340
00:21:13,704 --> 00:21:15,673
Well, you're set up, right?

341
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,673
Right?

342
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,971
I mean Grey's got to be
pretty chunky

343
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,773
in the money department,

344
00:21:22,813 --> 00:21:24,678
- plus, you have...
- I have, what?

345
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,643
Bills?
Responsibilities?

346
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:30,653
Four girls?
One that hates me,

347
00:21:30,686 --> 00:21:33,177
two or three that are
leaning that way.

348
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:38,920
You can have your damn
lots back there, Denny.

349
00:21:41,296 --> 00:21:43,423
I'm not here
for the lots.

350
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,866
Then leave.

351
00:21:48,903 --> 00:21:52,167
Any other reason than that
for you to be here, frankly,

352
00:21:52,207 --> 00:21:54,198
is just pitiful.

353
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:17,492
- Are you okay?
- No.

354
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:19,520
I'm a wreck.

355
00:22:21,634 --> 00:22:23,623
She's gonna take
us to school.

356
00:22:26,936 --> 00:22:29,962
You see women...

357
00:22:30,007 --> 00:22:32,907
on TV, in the movies,

358
00:22:32,942 --> 00:22:37,242
and they get left
or whatever.

359
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,147
You just wanna kick 'em,
they're so whiny.

360
00:22:41,618 --> 00:22:43,609
Look at me.

361
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:52,722
I hate his guts.
I hate his guts for what he's done.

362
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,228
Oh.

363
00:22:54,262 --> 00:22:56,230
He's a pig, your dad.

364
00:22:56,265 --> 00:22:59,132
Just a vile, selfish,
horrible pig,

365
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:00,999
but you know what?

366
00:23:01,036 --> 00:23:03,128
I'm not gonna trash him
to you girls.

367
00:23:03,172 --> 00:23:05,162
I'm not.

368
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:08,941
I hate him too.

369
00:23:08,974 --> 00:23:10,942
I hate him so much.

370
00:23:10,977 --> 00:23:13,444
I know you do, baby.

371
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,971
You're human.
How could you not?

372
00:23:21,121 --> 00:23:24,021
<i>When your eyes
were open wide</i>

373
00:23:27,026 --> 00:23:29,425
<i>- All right. See you.
- For the the last...</i>

374
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,499
Hey, hey, wait.

375
00:23:35,532 --> 00:23:37,000
Who is that?

376
00:23:37,035 --> 00:23:39,002
He's cute.

377
00:23:39,037 --> 00:23:41,005
That's Gorden Reiner.
He's new.

378
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:43,007
He's from Chicago.

379
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,009
- Go meet him.
- Yeah.

380
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:48,409
I met him. He's not
interested in me.

381
00:23:48,444 --> 00:23:51,471
All he likes to talk about
is bungee jumping.

382
00:23:52,715 --> 00:23:54,705
Tell him you're
from a broken home.

383
00:23:56,719 --> 00:23:59,813
- I'm serious.
- Should I?

384
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,948
Guys think things
like that are great.

385
00:24:03,092 --> 00:24:07,461
Trust me.
I'm gonna use it.

386
00:24:09,497 --> 00:24:11,464
Hi, Gorden.

387
00:24:11,499 --> 00:24:13,490
Hey.

388
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:17,359
Did you know I'm
from a broken home?

389
00:24:27,047 --> 00:24:29,037
Okay, bye.

390
00:25:01,443 --> 00:25:03,412
Turn it down.

391
00:25:05,481 --> 00:25:08,178
- Wolfmeyer residence
- Hey, beautiful.

392
00:25:08,218 --> 00:25:11,185
It's Denny.

393
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,982
- Which one is this?
- It's Andy.

394
00:25:13,021 --> 00:25:14,990
Bingo. You still
lookin' for work?

395
00:25:15,023 --> 00:25:18,049
- I am. - Well, I want you
to come in tomorrow.

396
00:25:18,093 --> 00:25:21,118
and see Shep Goodman
from my show.

397
00:25:21,163 --> 00:25:23,153
He needs
a production assistant.

398
00:25:23,198 --> 00:25:25,392
Denny, you're kidding me.

399
00:25:25,432 --> 00:25:27,401
- You're amazing.
- Yeah...

400
00:25:27,434 --> 00:25:29,460
well, you tell that to
your mom, we're even.

401
00:25:29,503 --> 00:25:31,971
So you come in tomorrow, okay?
I'll set you two up.

402
00:25:32,005 --> 00:25:34,529
Okay!
Thank you so much!

403
00:25:38,211 --> 00:25:40,179
Oh my God.

404
00:25:40,212 --> 00:25:42,238
I might get a job
working on Denny's show.

405
00:25:42,281 --> 00:25:44,250
- Are you kidding me?
- No!

406
00:25:44,284 --> 00:25:47,275
- That would be amazing!
- That would be so cool.

407
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,809
- Oh my God.
- What's up?

408
00:25:48,854 --> 00:25:51,152
Denny just called.
She might get a job on his show.

409
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,281
Oh, really?
Denny just called here?

410
00:25:53,325 --> 00:25:55,155
Yeah, I have an
interview tomorrow...

411
00:25:55,192 --> 00:25:56,625
for a job.

412
00:25:56,661 --> 00:25:58,855
Wait, wait.
What about school?

413
00:25:58,896 --> 00:26:01,161
I want a job.

414
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:03,064
I'm not going to college.

415
00:26:03,101 --> 00:26:06,468
Wha... you're not going
to college?

416
00:26:06,503 --> 00:26:09,665
No, I told Daddy and he wanted me
to wait to tell you, but now...

417
00:26:09,707 --> 00:26:11,834
Oh, but now that he's off
screwing his assistant,

418
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:14,365
you think you can safely drop
the bomb on me, is that it?

419
00:26:16,813 --> 00:26:18,780
No.

420
00:26:18,815 --> 00:26:22,011
"No" is right.
You are going to college!

421
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,041
You know damn well
how I feel about this.

422
00:26:26,422 --> 00:26:30,256
All four of you.
You're all goddamn going to college!

423
00:26:33,894 --> 00:26:35,224
I don't have a job open.

424
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:38,095
It's that simple, Denny.
It's cut and dry.

425
00:26:38,132 --> 00:26:40,099
This girl has something.

426
00:26:40,134 --> 00:26:42,102
She does, Sheppy,
she's sharp.

427
00:26:42,135 --> 00:26:44,104
She has class.

428
00:26:44,137 --> 00:26:47,505
You could be hiring the next, um...
Diane Sawyer.

429
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,237
I don't have a job open.

430
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:52,836
I know you don't,
but you could do this

431
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,846
for me, right?
You could do this for me.

432
00:26:54,881 --> 00:26:56,779
No, I can't.
Wanna know why?

433
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,782
- Yes, why?
- Okay, I'm gonna come in there.

434
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,511
I'm gonna tell you.
Hold on.

435
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:02,519
Jesus.

436
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,249
I'm going on
in a second here.

437
00:27:04,288 --> 00:27:06,519
Because, my lord,
I'm too busy doing

438
00:27:06,557 --> 00:27:08,252
other things for you.

439
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,057
"My lord"?

440
00:27:12,096 --> 00:27:15,123
<i>I'm looking for</i>

441
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:19,396
<i>A simple kind of life.
slow and easy</i>

442
00:27:19,435 --> 00:27:21,403
<i>- A life that won't
- Hi.</i>

443
00:27:21,438 --> 00:27:23,405
<i>- Bring me down
- Um, I'm Andy Wolfmeyer,</i>

444
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,102
I'm here to see
Shep Goodman about a job.

445
00:27:26,143 --> 00:27:28,770
Um... Denny Davies
asked me to come in.

446
00:27:28,811 --> 00:27:32,144
Oh, okay. Well, if you'd like
to take a seat over there.

447
00:27:32,182 --> 00:27:35,241
- I'll let him know you're here.
- Okay, thank you.

448
00:27:35,285 --> 00:27:37,252
No, you're not
understanding me,

449
00:27:37,287 --> 00:27:39,309
- You're making this really...
- I found one!

450
00:27:39,354 --> 00:27:41,322
I've got an opening.
Something's come up.

451
00:27:41,355 --> 00:27:42,788
I found an opening.

452
00:27:42,824 --> 00:27:44,290
- I'm on the phone.
- Okay.

453
00:27:44,325 --> 00:27:47,226
If you want her to have
the job, I'll make it happen.

454
00:27:47,261 --> 00:27:49,627
You'll just owe me, as usual.

455
00:27:49,663 --> 00:27:51,290
I got the job.

456
00:27:51,332 --> 00:27:53,993
What job?

457
00:27:54,035 --> 00:27:56,298
With Denny, as a
production assistant.

458
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:07,130
Yes, what?

459
00:29:07,167 --> 00:29:09,031
Are you looking
to get laid?

460
00:29:09,068 --> 00:29:11,037
Is... is this
what's going on?

461
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,198
I mean, are-are you
looking for

462
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,298
another notch in your belt,
or... I don't know...

463
00:29:15,342 --> 00:29:17,809
whatever it is you super
sports heroes call it.

464
00:29:17,844 --> 00:29:19,811
I mean are you looking
to get lucky with me...

465
00:29:19,846 --> 00:29:23,212
- to get me into bed?
- Uh, who's calling?

466
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:25,217
Be straight with me, Denny.

467
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,980
Be straight. Now, Grey always
thought you had an eye for me,

468
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:29,851
and I need you to be
really straight with me now.

469
00:29:29,888 --> 00:29:32,755
Uh, okay.
Um...

470
00:29:33,758 --> 00:29:35,851
I do like you.

471
00:29:35,894 --> 00:29:38,488
I always have.
Um...

472
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:40,498
You wanna have sex with me.
Is that it?

473
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:42,500
No!
Uh, no, I mean...

474
00:29:42,534 --> 00:29:45,695
um... well, uh...

475
00:29:45,736 --> 00:29:48,603
yeah, if you're offering,
I guess.

476
00:29:48,638 --> 00:29:50,266
Okay then.

477
00:29:50,307 --> 00:29:52,298
I'll be right there.
Give me 10 minutes.

478
00:29:53,742 --> 00:29:56,576
- Uh, ex... excuse me?
- Give me 10 minutes.

479
00:29:56,612 --> 00:29:59,273
I'm not gonna do much with my face,
though, so don't expect much.

480
00:29:59,315 --> 00:30:01,282
In fact,
keep the drapes shut.

481
00:30:01,317 --> 00:30:03,750
I don't like a lot of light.
It's not very light in there, is it?

482
00:30:03,786 --> 00:30:05,752
No, there, uh...

483
00:30:05,787 --> 00:30:08,118
there's not a lot
of light here.

484
00:30:08,155 --> 00:30:10,124
Okay, well,
have a drink.

485
00:30:10,157 --> 00:30:11,954
Have a couple.

486
00:30:11,992 --> 00:30:14,290
I don't want you to have
a real clear memory of this

487
00:30:14,328 --> 00:30:16,386
when it's over, okay?
I'll see you soon.

488
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:27,103
Slow down!

489
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,199
- Slow down!
- Oh, please. Come on.

490
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:31,938
- There's children playing here!
- Ah, get over yourself!

491
00:30:31,978 --> 00:30:33,969
There's children
playing here!

492
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:42,653
Hello?

493
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,679
I'm here!

494
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:51,750
Uh, Denny?

495
00:30:55,766 --> 00:30:57,461
Denny?

496
00:30:58,469 --> 00:31:00,460
I'm coming up!

497
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:05,530
Denny?

498
00:31:29,663 --> 00:31:31,756
Hello?

499
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:33,766
It's me.

500
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:36,325
Listen, um,
something came up.

501
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:39,167
I had a, uh...
I had a call.

502
00:31:39,205 --> 00:31:42,403
They needed me right away
over at the station.

503
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,500
- Shep's in some kind of trouble.
- Oh, yeah.

504
00:31:44,544 --> 00:31:47,067
- You are so full of shit.
- I'm not.

505
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,080
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

506
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,105
I'm not and...

507
00:31:52,349 --> 00:31:53,817
in fact, I'd like
a rain check.

508
00:31:53,852 --> 00:31:55,819
It's not gonna happen.

509
00:31:55,854 --> 00:31:57,822
This was like...
Halley's Comet.

510
00:31:57,855 --> 00:32:01,347
It's not coming around
again for 57 years.

511
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:08,055
What the fuck
is Halley's Comet?

512
00:32:08,098 --> 00:32:09,826
But this is the main
production booth

513
00:32:09,866 --> 00:32:12,334
This is where you and I will
be doing a lot of working.

514
00:32:12,367 --> 00:32:14,597
- Okay.
- Here, come on, I'll show you this.

515
00:32:14,636 --> 00:32:17,834
this is the live
on-air studio. Arthur?

516
00:32:17,874 --> 00:32:19,967
Say hello to my new
assistant Andy Wolfmeyer.

517
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:23,467
- Hello, Andy.
- This is Arthur Pennhallow.

518
00:32:23,512 --> 00:32:25,480
- He's a big deal here in town.
- Yeah.

519
00:32:25,515 --> 00:32:28,746
We're friends.
He idolizes me, actually.

520
00:32:28,785 --> 00:32:30,776
The fuck I do.

521
00:32:31,853 --> 00:32:33,819
- He does.
- Okay.

522
00:32:33,854 --> 00:32:36,584
That was a joke. We're tight,
and we're good friends.

523
00:32:36,624 --> 00:32:38,592
Okay.

524
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:41,185
So what is "Andy" short for?
"Andrea?"

525
00:32:41,228 --> 00:32:43,627
- Yeah, "Andrea. "
- Cool. See? I'm good with names.

526
00:32:43,663 --> 00:32:44,994
Yeah.

527
00:32:45,031 --> 00:32:47,000
Okay, I'll show you
up at the office now,

528
00:32:47,034 --> 00:32:49,001
- where we work a lot up there, too.
- Okay.

529
00:32:49,036 --> 00:32:51,003
Have you seen
an Emmy in person?

530
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:53,006
- You've won an Emmy?
- Couple.

531
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,506
Local, but who's counting?
Actually, I have three.

532
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,135
There's only two up there, 'cause one
I keep for the hotel room when I travel.

533
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:03,442
Wow.

534
00:33:14,925 --> 00:33:17,586
Kids, hurry up!
You're gonna be late!

535
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:22,121
- How's your lunch, Gordon?
- It's good.

536
00:33:28,371 --> 00:33:31,032
Did you ever see that documentary
on the Chicago Seven?

537
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:35,469
What about the one...

538
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:37,479
the one about the
Kent State killings?

539
00:33:37,512 --> 00:33:40,709
- No.
- Something like...

540
00:33:40,749 --> 00:33:42,717
six people were killed
by the cops,

541
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,719
there was
all this turmoil

542
00:33:44,752 --> 00:33:47,915
and it got really ugly and just
opened up a lot of old wounds

543
00:33:47,955 --> 00:33:49,445
between the police

544
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,481
and the people
of the area.

545
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:02,328
I'm from
a broken home also.

546
00:34:02,367 --> 00:34:04,528
You are?

547
00:34:09,675 --> 00:34:11,802
Hey, do you bungee jump?

548
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:15,476
- No.
- Well, I do.

549
00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:17,483
I go up with my dad.

550
00:34:17,516 --> 00:34:19,483
We drive up north
to Fenton Valley...

551
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:22,418
- and bungee jump off this huge crane.
- That sounds exciting.

552
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,840
Well, I read your letter.

553
00:34:48,876 --> 00:34:50,844
Was it too mean?

554
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:53,541
I don't want it
to be mean.

555
00:34:53,581 --> 00:34:55,014
Well, I mean I do,
but I don't.

556
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:57,382
Well, he's your father
and he's...

557
00:34:57,418 --> 00:35:00,614
left you
at a very tough time.

558
00:35:00,655 --> 00:35:03,054
I know and I want him to know
that it pisses me off he hasn't called.

559
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:05,284
Oh, he knows.

560
00:35:05,326 --> 00:35:07,793
He's not talking to his brother
or his friends at work.

561
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:09,523
He knows what he's done.

562
00:35:09,563 --> 00:35:11,052
Are you gonna call him?

563
00:35:11,097 --> 00:35:13,565
Please?

564
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,465
This is stupid.
It's just a stupid game.

565
00:35:15,501 --> 00:35:17,231
You said you have
his number.

566
00:35:17,269 --> 00:35:19,965
This letter is good.
I mean, it's good for you

567
00:35:20,005 --> 00:35:21,972
to get your feelings out.

568
00:35:22,007 --> 00:35:23,634
Um...

569
00:35:24,677 --> 00:35:26,940
I want you eating,
though.

570
00:35:26,978 --> 00:35:28,844
You are dancing so much.

571
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,643
Do you think maybe
it's too much?

572
00:35:30,682 --> 00:35:33,708
I know you have this out here.
Daddy built it for you,

573
00:35:33,751 --> 00:35:36,652
- but you spend so much time out here.
- You're such a head case.

574
00:35:36,688 --> 00:35:39,918
- What?
- Be happy for me.

575
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:42,925
Be proud!
Shit!

576
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,259
You know? I'm focused!
What is your problem?

577
00:35:46,295 --> 00:35:48,923
The only thing you're focused
on is drinking and Denny!

578
00:35:48,965 --> 00:35:50,956
Be glad that I have
a dream!

579
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:56,599
I was just going to tell
you how proud I am of you.

580
00:35:57,606 --> 00:35:59,472
That's the sad thing.

581
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,677
What?

582
00:36:03,711 --> 00:36:05,679
Well,
I'm not going to now.

583
00:36:05,713 --> 00:36:07,510
Not after that outburst.

584
00:36:07,548 --> 00:36:09,539
Fine, I don't care.

585
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,313
I'm in the kitchen
making dinner,

586
00:36:14,356 --> 00:36:17,085
and it wouldn't kill you
to come up and help.

587
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,226
Who knows? You may
get there just in time

588
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,251
to pull my head out
of the oven.

589
00:36:46,516 --> 00:36:49,007
- Hello?
- What... what are you doing?

590
00:36:50,621 --> 00:36:53,987
- Oh, making the girls' lunches.
- Good for you.

591
00:36:54,025 --> 00:36:57,255
Yeah, what the hell. I'm going after
the Mother-of-the-year award.

592
00:36:57,295 --> 00:37:00,161
See, um...

593
00:37:00,197 --> 00:37:02,960
- You know what I was thinking?
- No.

594
00:37:02,998 --> 00:37:05,831
Maybe it's been...
57 years.

595
00:37:05,867 --> 00:37:08,961
- What are you talking about?
- Halley's Comet, you know?

596
00:37:09,003 --> 00:37:10,994
By the way, it's, uh...

597
00:37:13,175 --> 00:37:16,201
76 years, but I'll give you
that one, smarty pants.

598
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,349
Can I come over?

599
00:37:21,382 --> 00:37:23,349
When?

600
00:37:23,384 --> 00:37:25,351
Now.

601
00:37:25,385 --> 00:37:28,353
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

602
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:33,416
- Did you hang up?
- Uh, not yet.

603
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,019
Good, then, um...
I'm coming over.

604
00:37:36,063 --> 00:37:37,826
I am, so...

605
00:37:37,864 --> 00:37:39,661
don't go hide
in the yard,

606
00:37:39,699 --> 00:37:42,134
don't pull any
reciprocal crap.

607
00:37:42,168 --> 00:37:44,501
Is that what you did that day?
You hid in the yard?

608
00:37:47,106 --> 00:37:49,096
No, um...

609
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,175
You know what?
Delete that last line.

610
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:54,177
Look, um...

611
00:37:54,211 --> 00:37:56,179
I'm coming over.
I am.

612
00:37:56,213 --> 00:37:58,204
I'm coming now.

613
00:38:02,753 --> 00:38:04,722
<i>Hold it.
Hold it!</i>

614
00:38:04,755 --> 00:38:06,724
Wait, wait, wait.

615
00:38:06,757 --> 00:38:08,384
- What is this?
- Your lunches.

616
00:38:08,425 --> 00:38:09,947
- Our lunches?
- Mm-hmm.

617
00:38:09,992 --> 00:38:11,960
- Are you kidding?
- I make my own lunch.

618
00:38:11,994 --> 00:38:13,963
You haven't done
it in years.

619
00:38:13,996 --> 00:38:15,987
I'm back to basics.
What do you want?

620
00:38:18,601 --> 00:38:20,831
- Bye.
- Have a good day!

621
00:38:58,036 --> 00:38:59,664
No!

622
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:20,918
Oh, shit.
Great.

623
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:32,568
Were you...
you taking off?

624
00:39:32,601 --> 00:39:35,297
Hey. You're taking off,
just like that?

625
00:39:35,336 --> 00:39:37,304
Yeah, I'm going to hide
in your yard.

626
00:39:37,338 --> 00:39:39,829
Oh, come on, that's bullshit.
I was kidding.

627
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:43,010
- What are you doing?
- Step out.

628
00:39:43,043 --> 00:39:45,034
Just step out.

629
00:39:48,016 --> 00:39:49,983
- Are you stoned?
- Not at all.

630
00:39:50,018 --> 00:39:52,009
- Not a bit.
- Well, you should be.

631
00:39:53,588 --> 00:39:55,554
Listen, I, uh...

632
00:39:55,588 --> 00:39:59,286
I know that you're fresh.
I know you're good and hurt

633
00:39:59,326 --> 00:40:01,690
and I know that on some level,
this is way too soon...

634
00:40:01,726 --> 00:40:03,695
- and not right.
- Yeah.

635
00:40:03,728 --> 00:40:05,697
What's the other level?

636
00:40:05,731 --> 00:40:09,132
I dial your number 10 times
a day and hang up.

637
00:40:09,168 --> 00:40:10,965
Come on!

638
00:40:11,003 --> 00:40:13,130
Just a minute.

639
00:40:13,172 --> 00:40:16,538
Goddamn, Terry, it's not like, you know,
it's not like I'm asking a lot.

640
00:40:16,574 --> 00:40:18,543
It's just...

641
00:40:18,577 --> 00:40:20,545
it's just...

642
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:22,547
I get it, okay?

643
00:40:22,581 --> 00:40:24,547
I know who I am for you.

644
00:40:24,581 --> 00:40:26,550
I'm this guy that you sit
and you drink...

645
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:28,552
and you talk with.

646
00:40:28,585 --> 00:40:31,987
- And now you want to fuck me.
- Well, you offered it.

647
00:40:32,021 --> 00:40:33,989
That was before you hid
in your yard.

648
00:40:34,023 --> 00:40:35,992
Well, I'm not hiding
in my yard, now am I?!

649
00:40:36,025 --> 00:40:38,322
- Hey come on, lady!
- Hey, hey, hey!

650
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,351
Can that horn, now!

651
00:40:41,697 --> 00:40:43,666
Jeez!

652
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:45,668
Not bad.

653
00:40:45,702 --> 00:40:47,692
Thank you.

654
00:40:49,036 --> 00:40:51,164
You wanna...
go back to my house?

655
00:40:51,206 --> 00:40:53,070
I've seen your house.

656
00:40:57,012 --> 00:40:58,842
I'll make the bed!

657
00:41:00,847 --> 00:41:02,838
Let's go to my house.

658
00:41:04,552 --> 00:41:06,543
Fine, let's go
to your house.

659
00:41:41,385 --> 00:41:43,353
Oh, God.

660
00:41:43,387 --> 00:41:46,048
Now that was
a real misstep.

661
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:51,327
Aw...

662
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,327
that was
a sweet thing to say.

663
00:41:53,362 --> 00:41:56,126
God, what am I doing?

664
00:41:56,164 --> 00:41:58,155
Why am I here?

665
00:41:59,534 --> 00:42:03,561
You're here because
you're sad and lonely.

666
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:05,572
Desperate.

667
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:08,940
You need someone,
something,

668
00:42:08,976 --> 00:42:10,945
anything to fill you.
Any...

669
00:42:10,978 --> 00:42:13,777
- port in a storm.
- Mmm.

670
00:42:13,815 --> 00:42:15,782
I asked why I
was here, not you.

671
00:42:15,817 --> 00:42:17,806
What's my story?

672
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,146
Oh, your story is...

673
00:42:23,255 --> 00:42:25,246
you're good and
bent out of shape.

674
00:42:27,193 --> 00:42:30,788
Pissed off like
I've never seen a woman.

675
00:42:42,074 --> 00:42:44,063
What?

676
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:07,460
Francis Wellard.

677
00:43:07,496 --> 00:43:09,487
Timothy Westerburg.

678
00:43:11,367 --> 00:43:13,358
Matthew Wintergarden.

679
00:43:14,603 --> 00:43:16,594
Hadley Wolfmeyer!

680
00:43:17,972 --> 00:43:19,804
Stephanie Winnington!

681
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:25,467
Nancy Woodside.

682
00:43:28,347 --> 00:43:30,748
It's a special day for her.
So, just be nice.

683
00:43:30,784 --> 00:43:32,751
- She's excited for you to meet him.
- Oh, really,

684
00:43:32,786 --> 00:43:35,880
how excited can she be?
She's been seeing him for three years.

685
00:43:35,922 --> 00:43:37,650
And she's in love?
She's in love?

686
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:41,320
- I'm just hearing about this today?
- Be nice!

687
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,920
It's not in my nature.
Why does she hate me so damn much?

688
00:43:43,963 --> 00:43:46,590
She doesn't hate you,
she just thinks that he's stupid.

689
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:49,827
She thinks he's stupid?!
I thought she loved him.

690
00:43:49,867 --> 00:43:51,802
No, she thinks
you'll think he's stupid.

691
00:43:51,835 --> 00:43:53,804
Well, I won't think that.
That's my point.

692
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:56,237
She judges me so harshly.
I am her mother.

693
00:43:56,273 --> 00:43:58,173
- Okay.
- I love her. I want her to be happy.

694
00:43:58,208 --> 00:44:00,403
I mean, if she loves
this guy I'm gonna love...

695
00:44:00,445 --> 00:44:04,074
- Okie dokie.
- Hi! Hi! Oh, baby!

696
00:44:04,114 --> 00:44:06,083
Baby!

697
00:44:06,117 --> 00:44:08,481
Oh God, I'm so proud
of you! I am!

698
00:44:08,518 --> 00:44:10,485
I am so proud of you.

699
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:12,317
- Let me see your face.
- Mother.

700
00:44:12,355 --> 00:44:15,119
A college graduate.
I'm so proud of you.

701
00:44:15,157 --> 00:44:17,456
Your father doesn't know
what he's missing today.

702
00:44:17,492 --> 00:44:19,460
I think he might.
Mm-mmm!

703
00:44:19,494 --> 00:44:21,326
This is it.
This is life.

704
00:44:21,364 --> 00:44:23,331
Mom?

705
00:44:23,365 --> 00:44:26,027
- David. Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

706
00:44:26,068 --> 00:44:28,434
My parents are having lunch
at the Wheeler hotel.

707
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:31,164
- You're all invited.
- The Wheeler, really?

708
00:44:31,204 --> 00:44:33,570
We'd... well, girls,
would you like that?

709
00:44:33,606 --> 00:44:35,574
- We... we had lunch.
- Have it again.

710
00:44:35,608 --> 00:44:38,702
Come on, I want us to go.
I want you to meet David's parents.

711
00:44:38,746 --> 00:44:41,681
David you tell your folks we'd
absolutely love to join them, okay?

712
00:44:41,715 --> 00:44:43,684
- Cool. Okay, see you later.
- See you later.

713
00:44:43,717 --> 00:44:45,686
Bye.

714
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:47,688
Wow.

715
00:44:47,722 --> 00:44:49,688
He is so handsome.

716
00:44:49,722 --> 00:44:51,690
Nice and...

717
00:44:51,724 --> 00:44:53,692
- intelligent.
- Mother.

718
00:44:53,726 --> 00:44:56,353
Oh! He is, baby.
I can tell by looking at him.

719
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:58,362
He's incredibly intelligent.

720
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:00,364
All right...
um...

721
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:02,367
there's something
you all should know.

722
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,527
You're pregnant and
you're getting married.

723
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:07,164
How did you know that?
Who told you that?

724
00:45:08,974 --> 00:45:11,168
I guessed?
Really?

725
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,199
I guessed that?
I was right?

726
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,179
No, you've got
to be kidding me.

727
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,840
No, I'm...
I'm not.

728
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,873
I'm getting married.

729
00:45:22,518 --> 00:45:24,487
This is how I find out?

730
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:27,422
Through Popeye?
A 15-year-old?

731
00:45:27,456 --> 00:45:29,253
- Don't be condescending...
- Close it!

732
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:31,259
You are a child.
What do you know?

733
00:45:31,293 --> 00:45:33,260
Oh, that old chestnut.

734
00:45:33,295 --> 00:45:35,262
You close it
as well, please.

735
00:45:35,297 --> 00:45:36,923
Do his parents know?

736
00:45:36,965 --> 00:45:38,592
Yes, they're ecstatic.

737
00:45:38,632 --> 00:45:40,362
Oh, how long have
they been ecstatic?

738
00:45:40,402 --> 00:45:42,597
You know what, can we just
go to the lunch please?

739
00:45:42,637 --> 00:45:45,070
How long have they been
ecstatic, damn you, Hadley?!

740
00:45:52,945 --> 00:45:55,436
I need a Bloody Mary as soon
as is humanly possible.

741
00:45:58,117 --> 00:46:00,085
Hi.
I'm Terry.

742
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:02,086
Oh. Gina.
Nice to meet you.

743
00:46:02,121 --> 00:46:04,487
- Nice to meet you.
- And this is David, my husband.

744
00:46:04,523 --> 00:46:06,514
Oh, David Senior.
That's nice.

745
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:08,527
You're not Jews, obviously.

746
00:46:10,663 --> 00:46:13,061
Oh, well I mean not that
that's a good or a bad thing.

747
00:46:13,097 --> 00:46:15,896
That they don't just
name their children

748
00:46:15,934 --> 00:46:18,231
after... okay,
that was horrible.

749
00:46:18,269 --> 00:46:21,034
Um... these are
Hadley's sisters,

750
00:46:21,072 --> 00:46:22,766
Emily, Andrea and Popeye.

751
00:46:22,807 --> 00:46:24,273
- Hi, girls.
- Hi.

752
00:46:24,307 --> 00:46:26,105
Could we order you
a drink before lunch?

753
00:46:26,143 --> 00:46:27,610
Oh, I'm set for now.
Thank you.

754
00:46:27,644 --> 00:46:29,340
Um, I'll have the same.

755
00:46:31,815 --> 00:46:33,306
Mmn.
Mmn!

756
00:46:33,349 --> 00:46:36,409
So, I understand we have something
to celebrate? Some good news, huh?

757
00:46:36,452 --> 00:46:38,045
Oh, we're
very excited, Terry.

758
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:40,715
We are crazy about Hadley.
We really are.

759
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:43,954
I knew from the minute
I met her. I did.

760
00:46:43,992 --> 00:46:45,516
- You did not.
- I did.

761
00:46:45,561 --> 00:46:46,994
No, Mother, you didn't.

762
00:46:47,028 --> 00:46:48,996
If she said she did,
she probably did!

763
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:50,896
Well, I was taken
for a surprise,

764
00:46:50,932 --> 00:46:53,333
- but... but a happy one.
- Yeah, well, you and me both.

765
00:46:57,472 --> 00:47:00,032
- Should we toast?
- Oh, yes. Let's do.

766
00:47:00,074 --> 00:47:02,769
Well... to David
and Hadley.

767
00:47:02,809 --> 00:47:05,005
- David and Hadley...
- Oh wait, wait, wait.

768
00:47:05,045 --> 00:47:07,139
My glass is...
this is bad luck. Uh, waiter?

769
00:47:07,181 --> 00:47:09,148
Mother, it's okay.
Here.

770
00:47:09,181 --> 00:47:11,809
Oh.

771
00:47:11,851 --> 00:47:13,820
Oh, just...
a little more.

772
00:47:13,853 --> 00:47:15,820
Just...

773
00:47:15,855 --> 00:47:17,822
Thank you.

774
00:47:17,856 --> 00:47:19,824
So, shall we toast?

775
00:47:19,858 --> 00:47:22,657
- May I?
- Please, do.

776
00:47:26,264 --> 00:47:28,233
To David and Hadley.

777
00:47:28,266 --> 00:47:31,757
A long and beautiful
partnership.

778
00:47:31,802 --> 00:47:32,996
- Aww.
- Thanks.

779
00:47:33,036 --> 00:47:35,005
The... mostly right now...

780
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:38,097
I'm sorry, David,
this is very emotional for me.

781
00:47:39,309 --> 00:47:41,277
To my baby.

782
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,541
My first born,
my little Hadley-wadley.

783
00:47:43,579 --> 00:47:45,172
Aww.

784
00:47:45,215 --> 00:47:48,184
That's what we called her.
Hadley-wadley.

785
00:47:48,217 --> 00:47:51,016
She was so loved from
the minute she was born.

786
00:47:51,054 --> 00:47:53,021
Just an adorable
little thing.

787
00:47:53,056 --> 00:47:56,081
She was... well,
she grew up too fast didn't she?

788
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:58,114
She grew up so fast
and had a mouth on her.

789
00:47:58,159 --> 00:47:59,353
Mother!

790
00:47:59,393 --> 00:48:01,021
When she was in her teens
she was her own little boss.

791
00:48:01,061 --> 00:48:02,119
Mother!

792
00:48:02,163 --> 00:48:03,824
And she would sometimes
just not come home...

793
00:48:03,864 --> 00:48:06,264
All right, could we just toast, please?
Thank you.

794
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,134
Okay, baby.
We'll toast.

795
00:48:13,574 --> 00:48:15,543
You have to
forgive me. Um...

796
00:48:15,577 --> 00:48:17,373
you all had a chance
to process this,

797
00:48:17,411 --> 00:48:19,344
and I'm just coming
on board, so to speak.

798
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,847
To Hadley-wadley.

799
00:48:22,882 --> 00:48:24,873
Hadley-wadley.

800
00:48:32,525 --> 00:48:34,550
Mmn.

801
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:38,996
Oh.

802
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:40,998
Oh!

803
00:48:41,032 --> 00:48:42,726
Oh, no, no.
I'm done toasting.

804
00:48:42,766 --> 00:48:44,757
I'm just ordering
another drink.

805
00:48:46,237 --> 00:48:48,204
- It was horrible.
- Maybe it wasn't.

806
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:50,206
Maybe it wasn't
as bad as you thought.

807
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,208
No, it was horrible.

808
00:48:52,242 --> 00:48:54,677
It was. I made an ass
of myself. I was like...

809
00:48:54,711 --> 00:48:57,373
a public service film
against drinking.

810
00:48:57,414 --> 00:48:59,382
Just...

811
00:48:59,416 --> 00:49:01,382
yeah, I was an old lush.

812
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:03,385
Poor Hadley.

813
00:49:03,418 --> 00:49:05,387
I feel so bad
for her, Denny.

814
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:07,945
Why are we going
out here?

815
00:49:09,724 --> 00:49:11,693
I hate the way
I come off to my girls.

816
00:49:11,726 --> 00:49:13,820
I just hate that I can't
control my emotions.

817
00:49:16,898 --> 00:49:18,594
Oh, God.

818
00:49:18,634 --> 00:49:20,625
This is creepy.

819
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:25,804
This was all a farm
owned by the...

820
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,806
Firestone family
until the 50's.

821
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,570
This and the whole
subdivision.

822
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:32,271
It goes on a bit about
another eight acres.

823
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:36,672
Why are we out
here today?

824
00:49:38,585 --> 00:49:40,576
I wanna do it.

825
00:49:42,623 --> 00:49:44,282
- Out here?
- No.

826
00:49:44,322 --> 00:49:46,289
Don't be an asshole.

827
00:49:46,324 --> 00:49:48,315
I wanna sell
my part of it.

828
00:49:49,728 --> 00:49:51,992
Just let your friends develop
the lots and tell them "Yes. "

829
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,519
Tell them I don't need
the money, though.

830
00:49:53,565 --> 00:49:56,226
If they think I need the money,
they'll play games with me.

831
00:49:57,902 --> 00:50:00,166
- Do you?
- No.

832
00:50:00,204 --> 00:50:02,764
Yes. No.
I don't know.

833
00:50:04,842 --> 00:50:06,809
I'm in some trouble...

834
00:50:06,844 --> 00:50:08,902
unless I officially
divorce the shitbox

835
00:50:08,945 --> 00:50:10,913
which I refuse to do,

836
00:50:10,947 --> 00:50:13,574
until at least he has
the balls to show his face.

837
00:50:19,789 --> 00:50:21,780
I wanna give
the girls the money.

838
00:50:22,958 --> 00:50:25,289
Just tell your friend Shep
I want to make the deal.

839
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:30,021
What?

840
00:50:31,164 --> 00:50:33,463
Nothin'.

841
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:35,195
Good.
I'm going in.

842
00:50:35,235 --> 00:50:37,500
This place is a clearinghouse
for Lime disease.

843
00:50:47,313 --> 00:50:49,474
- Hey, this is cute.
- Shep...

844
00:50:49,516 --> 00:50:51,813
- How are you, pal?
- I'm doing great.

845
00:50:51,851 --> 00:50:53,818
I'm hanging with Andy,
how could I not be?

846
00:50:53,851 --> 00:50:55,376
Hello, Terry.

847
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,411
Hadley...

848
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:01,882
Hadley's boyfriend.

849
00:51:01,927 --> 00:51:03,894
Okay, okay.

850
00:51:03,929 --> 00:51:06,329
- We're gonna go watch a movie.
- Isn't that sweet?

851
00:51:06,364 --> 00:51:10,164
"The Bicycle Thief. "
She's never seen "The Bicycle Thief. "

852
00:51:10,201 --> 00:51:11,827
He's a nut
for foreign cinema.

853
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:13,530
Anyone wanna join us?

854
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:16,197
Snuggle up on the couch?
Watch a classic?

855
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:24,780
I think we'll, uh,
probably pass.

856
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:27,181
Is it the subtitles?

857
00:51:28,184 --> 00:51:30,152
You know me too well.

858
00:51:30,186 --> 00:51:32,847
I do and it's a burden.

859
00:51:34,856 --> 00:51:36,824
- I know him too well...
- Okay.

860
00:51:36,858 --> 00:51:38,826
so it's a burden.
That's it.

861
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,293
Okay.

862
00:51:40,327 --> 00:51:43,728
I cannot tell you how much
this thing disgusts me.

863
00:51:43,764 --> 00:51:45,733
Oh, come on.
She's doing great at work.

864
00:51:45,766 --> 00:51:48,257
Shep's got her producing
morning drive-time,

865
00:51:48,302 --> 00:51:51,532
plus... I think
he really likes her.

866
00:51:51,572 --> 00:51:53,938
Oh, the whole thing
just infuriates me.

867
00:51:53,974 --> 00:51:55,965
That's probably half
the attraction.

868
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,746
What?

869
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:04,079
You know what.
Not another word.

870
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:20,597
The deep hatred that men
have felt for one another

871
00:52:20,798 --> 00:52:23,733
through the ages has blossomed
into one chapter after another

872
00:52:23,768 --> 00:52:27,465
of repression,
violence, hate, rape,

873
00:52:27,505 --> 00:52:29,405
religious slang
and genocide.

874
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,998
I'm still working on it.

875
00:52:32,041 --> 00:52:34,804
I need to fix the music.

876
00:52:34,844 --> 00:52:36,777
It's my final in
television production.

877
00:52:47,588 --> 00:52:49,579
You're really handsome,
Gorden.

878
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:52,949
Thanks.

879
00:53:02,402 --> 00:53:04,393
I should go.

880
00:53:09,509 --> 00:53:11,500
I really do have to go.

881
00:53:16,949 --> 00:53:19,509
The power of stress
and naked anger

882
00:53:19,552 --> 00:53:21,782
is seen over and over again
in the relationships

883
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:24,516
that exist between the male
and the female of our species.

884
00:53:24,556 --> 00:53:27,253
Here, in rural Botswana,
an unfaithful tribeswoman

885
00:53:27,293 --> 00:53:29,157
is brought to a field
by a group of locals

886
00:53:29,195 --> 00:53:31,753
for a ritualized punishment
of beating and harassment.

887
00:53:31,795 --> 00:53:34,820
Events quickly spiral out of control
for the tribesmen, though

888
00:53:34,864 --> 00:53:37,094
as the woman's fury
becomes too great to contain

889
00:53:37,134 --> 00:53:40,297
and the men are quickly forced
to flee for their safety.

890
00:54:19,239 --> 00:54:21,400
Why am I not excited by it?

891
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,967
Um, because I don't think any
of these new age arts colleges

892
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:26,978
are really colleges.

893
00:54:27,012 --> 00:54:29,538
Of course, it's a college.
What are you talking about?

894
00:54:29,581 --> 00:54:32,244
Honey, I've been there.
I have.

895
00:54:32,284 --> 00:54:34,253
I wanted to be a poet,
remember?

896
00:54:34,286 --> 00:54:36,255
Just take arts courses
at Ann Arbor.

897
00:54:36,289 --> 00:54:38,550
I don't want to go
to school in Ann Arbor.

898
00:54:38,588 --> 00:54:41,614
No, of course you don't. It's what
I want you to do. Why would you?

899
00:54:41,659 --> 00:54:44,184
Okay, four years learning
dance theory?

900
00:54:44,228 --> 00:54:46,128
I have a theory about that.

901
00:54:46,163 --> 00:54:48,153
It's not going to happen.

902
00:55:02,478 --> 00:55:04,469
How's the show?
You enjoying it?

903
00:55:13,755 --> 00:55:15,746
I wish you would
take me seriously.

904
00:55:15,791 --> 00:55:17,759
Honey, I take you seriously.

905
00:55:17,793 --> 00:55:20,784
I just don't think you have much
capacity for self-evaluation.

906
00:55:20,827 --> 00:55:23,795
You know, you'd think
you'd be happy for me...

907
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:25,797
considering the way
your life turned out.

908
00:55:25,831 --> 00:55:28,891
- The way your parents pushed you...
- To marry your father?

909
00:55:28,936 --> 00:55:31,130
- Yeah.
- I'm not complaining.

910
00:55:32,505 --> 00:55:34,474
They pushed me to
take life seriously...

911
00:55:34,507 --> 00:55:36,498
not to live
in the clouds.

912
00:55:40,346 --> 00:55:42,974
Do you have any idea
what a fucking idiot

913
00:55:43,014 --> 00:55:45,278
you sound like
sometimes?

914
00:55:52,791 --> 00:55:54,759
I love how you worry
that the letter

915
00:55:54,793 --> 00:55:57,956
you sent to the parent who
deserted you is too mean,

916
00:55:57,996 --> 00:56:00,327
and yet, to the one
who's here in the fight,

917
00:56:00,364 --> 00:56:03,264
you have no problem
saying the most vile things.

918
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:04,960
Isn't that a tad odd?

919
00:56:12,074 --> 00:56:14,838
Please finish setting
the table.

920
00:56:31,992 --> 00:56:33,983
Fuck you!

921
00:56:36,262 --> 00:56:38,231
Shep, wake up.
Wake up, wake up.

922
00:56:38,264 --> 00:56:40,391
- Hey.
- Oh, it's 5:00.

923
00:56:40,434 --> 00:56:41,525
Okay, 5:00.
Just...

924
00:56:41,568 --> 00:56:43,695
No, my mother's downstairs
we need to get up.

925
00:56:43,737 --> 00:56:46,001
We need to get up right...
Ah, hello!

926
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:48,199
Okay, not now.
We need to get...

927
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,038
- No, we need to get up.
- And...

928
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:53,501
My...

929
00:56:55,179 --> 00:56:57,170
G... God!

930
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:12,161
Wow.

931
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:14,164
That was weird, huh?

932
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:16,164
Yeah.

933
00:58:03,943 --> 00:58:06,275
And according to a recent report,
the average male waist size

934
00:58:06,311 --> 00:58:08,438
in the United States
has increased four sizes

935
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,414
in the last 10 years.
From 34 to 38.

936
00:58:11,449 --> 00:58:13,418
See, here's my question.

937
00:58:13,452 --> 00:58:15,681
When are they going to stop
calling it 'average? '

938
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:17,744
Just start calling it
what it is. "Fat ass!"

939
00:58:17,789 --> 00:58:19,757
You have a fat ass!

940
00:58:19,791 --> 00:58:21,759
Say something to her.

941
00:58:25,795 --> 00:58:27,786
- Go in there.
- No.

942
00:58:29,666 --> 00:58:32,498
- Do you mind if I do?
- Yes, I do mind.

943
00:58:32,534 --> 00:58:34,525
Quite a bit.

944
00:58:37,606 --> 00:58:40,336
All right.

945
00:58:40,376 --> 00:58:42,344
Well...

946
00:58:42,378 --> 00:58:44,005
Well what?

947
00:58:45,014 --> 00:58:47,003
Well...

948
00:58:48,784 --> 00:58:51,842
I didn't quite actually have the
end of that thought worked out.

949
00:58:54,722 --> 00:58:56,713
It's late.

950
00:58:58,492 --> 00:59:00,460
I think you should
go home, Denny.

951
00:59:00,494 --> 00:59:02,554
I think it's going to be
nothing but trouble,

952
00:59:02,597 --> 00:59:05,429
you staying here tonight.

953
00:59:05,465 --> 00:59:08,161
Well, if you want me
to leave, just say so.

954
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,431
That was a joke.

955
00:59:26,085 --> 00:59:28,451
...English National
Ballet School

956
00:59:28,487 --> 00:59:30,454
under the direction
of Katherine Wade

957
00:59:30,489 --> 00:59:32,545
perform their highly
acclaimed production...

958
00:59:32,588 --> 00:59:34,556
Can we talk?

959
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:36,820
Not now,
I have a stomachache.

960
00:59:38,929 --> 00:59:41,193
Well, can I get
you anything?

961
00:59:41,231 --> 00:59:43,222
No, but you can shut
the door.

962
01:00:17,963 --> 01:00:19,931
I'm gay.

963
01:00:19,965 --> 01:00:21,956
What?

964
01:00:24,003 --> 01:00:25,731
No.

965
01:00:25,771 --> 01:00:27,672
No, no, no.
You're not.

966
01:00:27,706 --> 01:00:29,675
Yeah.

967
01:00:29,708 --> 01:00:31,608
I am.

968
01:00:33,445 --> 01:00:35,436
Are you lying to get
out of kissing me?

969
01:00:39,317 --> 01:00:41,307
Have you ever
had gay sex?

970
01:00:45,021 --> 01:00:47,012
What about sex
with a woman?

971
01:00:50,161 --> 01:00:53,391
Look, you can't be gay
if you haven't tried it.

972
01:00:53,431 --> 01:00:55,398
Or at least tried it
with a girl

973
01:00:55,432 --> 01:00:58,094
to know that you don't
like it with girls.

974
01:00:58,134 --> 01:01:00,101
No.

975
01:01:00,135 --> 01:01:02,659
I like men,
because I'm gay.

976
01:01:05,074 --> 01:01:07,065
I think you're lying.

977
01:01:08,177 --> 01:01:10,168
I do, and I think
it's mean.

978
01:01:12,081 --> 01:01:14,048
Have sex with me.

979
01:01:14,083 --> 01:01:16,074
Just try it

980
01:01:16,117 --> 01:01:18,311
and then, if you want to be gay,
you can be gay.

981
01:01:18,353 --> 01:01:20,344
That's nice of you.

982
01:01:48,112 --> 01:01:51,139
Hi. Um, I came
to apologize.

983
01:01:51,181 --> 01:01:53,150
- Did you?
- I did.

984
01:01:53,184 --> 01:01:54,981
I've been
a real shit to you.

985
01:01:55,019 --> 01:01:57,545
Yes, you have.

986
01:01:57,588 --> 01:01:59,385
What's this?

987
01:01:59,422 --> 01:02:01,152
Well, I just want to do
something nice for you.

988
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:02,590
I want to clean
your house.

989
01:02:02,626 --> 01:02:05,458
What if I don't want
my house cleaned?

990
01:02:05,496 --> 01:02:08,827
Well, come on. Just don't be defensive
and shitty because I've been shitty.

991
01:02:08,864 --> 01:02:09,956
- Let us in, okay?
- No. No.

992
01:02:09,998 --> 01:02:12,092
No, come on. We're not gonna destroy
it, we're gonna clean it.

993
01:02:12,135 --> 01:02:14,159
I don't want my house
cleaned, Terry, okay?

994
01:02:14,202 --> 01:02:16,193
I just want you to
be nice to me, okay?

995
01:02:18,041 --> 01:02:20,007
You know something?

996
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:22,476
What?

997
01:02:25,514 --> 01:02:27,481
Nothing.

998
01:02:27,516 --> 01:02:30,972
Right. Then move,
I'm coming in to clean.

999
01:02:41,393 --> 01:02:43,362
These...

1000
01:02:43,396 --> 01:02:45,364
are all inventoried,
okay?

1001
01:02:45,398 --> 01:02:47,365
I know how many
boxes are here.

1002
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,369
- And what does that mean?
- You know what it means.

1003
01:02:51,804 --> 01:02:53,771
I don't know this crew.

1004
01:02:53,806 --> 01:02:55,797
You don't either.

1005
01:02:57,076 --> 01:02:59,043
This is why I don't like
people over.

1006
01:02:59,077 --> 01:03:01,478
I don't like too many people
knowing what I have here.

1007
01:03:01,512 --> 01:03:03,503
They're balls, Denny,
not gold bullion.

1008
01:03:05,483 --> 01:03:07,451
Yeah, well...
say what you want

1009
01:03:07,485 --> 01:03:09,476
but they keep me
in firewood.

1010
01:03:17,728 --> 01:03:19,719
I do what I have to do.

1011
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:23,498
I'm not ashamed.

1012
01:03:23,532 --> 01:03:25,523
I didn't say
you should be.

1013
01:03:27,202 --> 01:03:29,034
Other...

1014
01:03:30,873 --> 01:03:32,840
Other guys
I played with, they, uh...

1015
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:35,639
pulled car dealerships
out their asses, you know,

1016
01:03:35,677 --> 01:03:38,237
ran insurance companies
after they retired?

1017
01:03:39,414 --> 01:03:41,405
That wasn't me.

1018
01:03:43,117 --> 01:03:45,108
I get by, though.

1019
01:03:46,853 --> 01:03:48,822
You wanna have a drink?

1020
01:03:48,856 --> 01:03:50,847
You know me pretty well,
what do you think?

1021
01:03:56,163 --> 01:03:58,427
So what is it
about you and baseball?

1022
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,697
Aw, come on, why don't
you just call in to the show

1023
01:04:02,735 --> 01:04:04,702
if you're gonna hit me
with that one.

1024
01:04:04,737 --> 01:04:06,862
Come on, really.
What are you so touchy about?

1025
01:04:06,905 --> 01:04:08,702
Nothing.
I'm just not sure

1026
01:04:08,739 --> 01:04:10,731
what they want from
me anymore, you know?

1027
01:04:11,809 --> 01:04:13,777
It was good.
It was grand.

1028
01:04:13,811 --> 01:04:17,110
Nice. Next.
It's over.

1029
01:04:17,148 --> 01:04:20,141
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

1030
01:04:20,184 --> 01:04:22,585
And I realize I'm a
walking contradiction.

1031
01:04:22,621 --> 01:04:24,588
You know, hocking balls...

1032
01:04:24,621 --> 01:04:26,588
going to malls,
having my picture taken

1033
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,614
in a room
full of fat fucks.

1034
01:04:33,429 --> 01:04:35,898
It's just... you know, it's...
I'm... I'm tired, okay?

1035
01:04:35,931 --> 01:04:39,731
- I'm just...
- Yeah, I know. Moving ahead is hard.

1036
01:04:39,768 --> 01:04:43,489
No, I don't have a problem
with moving ahead.

1037
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:53,335
You know what it is I like about going
over to your house, Terry?

1038
01:04:55,048 --> 01:04:57,016
I like how it smells.

1039
01:04:57,050 --> 01:04:59,041
Something's always cooking.

1040
01:05:00,887 --> 01:05:03,253
My house doesn't smell
like that.

1041
01:05:03,291 --> 01:05:06,192
And I don't even mind going
over there when there's tension,

1042
01:05:06,226 --> 01:05:08,750
and there's a... there's a fucking
lot of it, you know?

1043
01:05:08,793 --> 01:05:11,284
Somebody is always
mad at somebody.

1044
01:05:11,329 --> 01:05:13,297
Doors are slammin'.

1045
01:05:13,331 --> 01:05:15,322
Fur's flyin'.

1046
01:05:16,501 --> 01:05:19,369
Even when no one
is talkin', it's...

1047
01:05:19,405 --> 01:05:21,373
it's loud.

1048
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:23,398
But at least
it's fucking real.

1049
01:05:29,347 --> 01:05:32,838
Believe me, this is not where
I saw my life going, okay?

1050
01:05:32,882 --> 01:05:35,612
This is not how
I would've drawn it.

1051
01:05:39,523 --> 01:05:41,514
But I'm okay
with all of it.

1052
01:05:46,163 --> 01:05:48,153
Well...

1053
01:05:48,197 --> 01:05:50,164
lucky me.

1054
01:05:50,199 --> 01:05:51,871
No.

1055
01:05:52,675 --> 01:05:54,228
No.

1056
01:05:55,213 --> 01:05:56,554
Lucky me.

1057
01:06:00,175 --> 01:06:02,143
When I'm with you, Terry...

1058
01:06:02,177 --> 01:06:04,168
with your girls...

1059
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:08,646
I feel like there's
a big chunk of my life

1060
01:06:08,682 --> 01:06:10,673
still left to be played out.

1061
01:06:12,552 --> 01:06:14,521
And that's what
I want to talk about,

1062
01:06:14,554 --> 01:06:16,545
not... baseball.

1063
01:06:18,590 --> 01:06:22,288
I've had my heart broken
really badly, Denny.

1064
01:06:25,532 --> 01:06:27,523
I know.

1065
01:06:28,934 --> 01:06:30,902
It's not the kind of
thing that ever heals.

1066
01:06:30,936 --> 01:06:33,369
Yeah, it does. It heals.
It just heals funny.

1067
01:06:33,405 --> 01:06:35,373
You know, you more
or less walk...

1068
01:06:35,407 --> 01:06:37,034
with a limp.

1069
01:06:41,311 --> 01:06:43,280
Well, we'll...

1070
01:06:43,313 --> 01:06:46,181
we'll figure out a way
to be okay with that.

1071
01:06:46,217 --> 01:06:47,775
You know...

1072
01:06:47,818 --> 01:06:49,809
with the limp.

1073
01:07:03,264 --> 01:07:07,099
<i>Oh, she may be weary</i>

1074
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:11,596
<i>And young girls,
they do get weary</i>

1075
01:07:11,639 --> 01:07:14,608
<i>Wearing that...</i>

1076
01:07:14,641 --> 01:07:17,610
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1077
01:07:17,644 --> 01:07:19,612
I'm showing.

1078
01:07:19,646 --> 01:07:21,614
I can't... I'm so pissed
off I'm showing.

1079
01:07:21,648 --> 01:07:23,275
Well, you're not
showing that bad.

1080
01:07:23,318 --> 01:07:25,443
Another two weeks,
and we'd have to elope.

1081
01:07:25,485 --> 01:07:27,476
I have to go
get my bracelet.

1082
01:07:32,492 --> 01:07:35,119
I hate the fact that so many people
know she's pregnant.

1083
01:07:35,161 --> 01:07:37,391
Half of them, she's told.
I think she's actually

1084
01:07:37,429 --> 01:07:39,728
- proud of herself for this.
- What's the big deal?

1085
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:41,494
She would have gotten
married anyway.

1086
01:07:41,534 --> 01:07:43,161
I know, sweetie,
she's a doll.

1087
01:07:43,202 --> 01:07:45,431
I just wish she could learn to keep
her goddamn mouth shut.

1088
01:07:45,471 --> 01:07:47,300
Hey.

1089
01:07:48,306 --> 01:07:50,273
- Do I look horrible?
- No.

1090
01:07:50,307 --> 01:07:52,036
- Tell me the truth.
- Are you kidding?

1091
01:07:52,077 --> 01:07:53,942
You... are...

1092
01:07:53,978 --> 01:07:56,503
a beautiful,
gorgeous bride.

1093
01:07:56,547 --> 01:07:58,514
- I am?
- Yes.

1094
01:07:58,548 --> 01:08:01,278
You are. You look
perfect in that dress.

1095
01:08:01,318 --> 01:08:04,775
Elegant and classy
and sexy and fresh

1096
01:08:04,822 --> 01:08:06,789
and your skin
looks great.

1097
01:08:06,824 --> 01:08:09,222
And your face is big and plump
and healthy-looking.

1098
01:08:09,257 --> 01:08:11,385
- Oh, I could just eat you up!
- My face is plump?

1099
01:08:11,427 --> 01:08:13,394
Oh, God.
No, I didn't...

1100
01:08:13,429 --> 01:08:15,293
- My...
- I didn't mean plump as in plump.

1101
01:08:15,331 --> 01:08:16,627
You said my face
looks plump.

1102
01:08:16,666 --> 01:08:18,929
No, I meant plump
like "adorable. "

1103
01:08:18,966 --> 01:08:20,490
- Liar!
- I did! Sweetheart...

1104
01:08:20,534 --> 01:08:23,503
I have a fat face on my wedding
day and you... you know it!

1105
01:08:23,537 --> 01:08:26,268
You do not have a fat face, a plump
face, she didn't mean it, I swear.

1106
01:08:26,307 --> 01:08:29,175
- She just told me my face looked fat.
- Sweetheart... honey...

1107
01:08:29,211 --> 01:08:32,304
You're... wh... 10 minutes before my
wedding ceremony? That's just mean.

1108
01:08:32,345 --> 01:08:34,371
Well, what about all the beautiful
things that I said with that?

1109
01:08:34,414 --> 01:08:36,144
- Can we focus on those?
- Right, right, right.

1110
01:08:36,182 --> 01:08:38,707
- Nice fat face, Hadley. Go get married.
- Hadley! Ha...

1111
01:08:38,752 --> 01:08:40,743
Hadley...

1112
01:08:42,521 --> 01:08:44,512
Okay.

1113
01:08:47,127 --> 01:08:49,095
She'll be fine.

1114
01:08:49,128 --> 01:08:53,587
...what potential the bonds
of marriage hold for us.

1115
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:57,693
To walk together into
the fog of the future.

1116
01:08:57,735 --> 01:08:59,703
Two partners, together...

1117
01:08:59,737 --> 01:09:01,704
in concert...

1118
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:03,707
in tandem...

1119
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:06,573
in holy matrimony.

1120
01:09:06,610 --> 01:09:10,877
Is any bond as sacred
as this one?

1121
01:09:10,914 --> 01:09:14,817
Is any promise
more permanent?

1122
01:09:14,851 --> 01:09:17,877
<i>Girl</i>

1123
01:09:17,921 --> 01:09:21,219
<i>You'll be a woman</i>

1124
01:09:21,256 --> 01:09:23,247
<i>Soon</i>

1125
01:09:25,226 --> 01:09:27,559
<i>I love you so much
can't count all the ways</i>

1126
01:09:27,595 --> 01:09:29,927
<i>I'd die for you girl
and all they can say is</i>

1127
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:33,195
<i>"He's not your kind"</i>

1128
01:09:33,234 --> 01:09:35,203
<i>They never get tired
of putting me down</i>

1129
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:38,331
<i>And I'll never know
when I come around</i>

1130
01:09:38,373 --> 01:09:40,341
<i>What I'm gonna find</i>

1131
01:09:40,375 --> 01:09:42,204
<i>- Don't let them make up your mind
- Emily.</i>

1132
01:09:42,242 --> 01:09:44,710
Would you like
to dance with me?

1133
01:09:44,744 --> 01:09:47,542
I don't think so. I have
a stomachache right now.

1134
01:09:47,581 --> 01:09:50,175
Oh, bullshit.
Come on.

1135
01:09:50,216 --> 01:09:52,185
<i>- You'll be a woman soon
- Come on.</i>

1136
01:09:52,219 --> 01:09:54,448
I don't... I don't want her
or any of them to judge me.

1137
01:09:54,488 --> 01:09:56,421
<i>- Please
- Okay.</i>

1138
01:09:56,457 --> 01:09:59,948
<i>- Come take my hand
- I don't want them judging me either.</i>

1139
01:10:01,993 --> 01:10:05,087
<i>Girl</i>

1140
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:10,033
<i>You'll be a woman...
soon</i>

1141
01:10:10,068 --> 01:10:13,127
<i>Soon</i>

1142
01:10:13,171 --> 01:10:17,698
<i>You'll need a man</i>

1143
01:10:17,743 --> 01:10:20,234
<i>I've been misunderstood
for all of my life</i>

1144
01:10:20,278 --> 01:10:22,837
<i>But that's what they're sayin',
it cuts like a knife</i>

1145
01:10:22,881 --> 01:10:25,313
<i>"The boy's no good"</i>

1146
01:10:25,347 --> 01:10:28,215
<i>When I've finally found
what I'm looking for</i>

1147
01:10:28,251 --> 01:10:30,480
<i>If they get the chance,
they'll end it for sure</i>

1148
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:33,386
<i>They surely would</i>

1149
01:10:33,422 --> 01:10:36,186
<i>Baby, I've done
all I could</i>

1150
01:10:36,225 --> 01:10:40,753
<i>Now, it's up
to you girl</i>

1151
01:10:46,634 --> 01:10:49,363
I'll have, um,
a coke, please.

1152
01:10:49,403 --> 01:10:51,029
Coke?

1153
01:10:51,072 --> 01:10:53,336
Not drinking today?

1154
01:10:56,610 --> 01:10:58,578
Okay, nice talking
to you.

1155
01:10:58,613 --> 01:11:00,239
<i>Have you heard
the news?</i>

1156
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:03,579
<i>It's all over town,
if you ain't heard it boys</i>

1157
01:11:03,618 --> 01:11:05,983
<i>- You'd better sit down
- What is your problem?</i>

1158
01:11:06,019 --> 01:11:08,145
I don't have a problem.
I'm having a nice day.

1159
01:11:08,188 --> 01:11:11,645
Running around with young women half
your age. I mean, what is that about?

1160
01:11:11,689 --> 01:11:15,989
You manipulate young women,
use your power and title

1161
01:11:16,028 --> 01:11:19,054
to seduce them, and get them
to run around with you.

1162
01:11:19,097 --> 01:11:21,588
- Yeah, so?
- It makes me sick,

1163
01:11:21,634 --> 01:11:23,601
the thought of you
with my daughter.

1164
01:11:23,636 --> 01:11:26,195
Well, here's a tip.
Don't think about it.

1165
01:11:29,541 --> 01:11:31,507
Goddamn.

1166
01:11:31,542 --> 01:11:34,568
<i>Betty Lou's
getting out tonight</i>

1167
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:37,011
<i>Betty Lou's getting
out tonight</i>

1168
01:11:37,046 --> 01:11:39,675
<i>Betty Lou's
getting out tonight</i>

1169
01:11:39,716 --> 01:11:42,548
<i>She was bad,
her mama got mad</i>

1170
01:11:42,586 --> 01:11:44,712
<i>But her mama
said it's all right</i>

1171
01:11:44,755 --> 01:11:46,746
Who should
I sleep with, Terry?

1172
01:11:46,789 --> 01:11:49,655
Women like you?

1173
01:11:49,692 --> 01:11:52,182
<i>- Betty Lou's getting out tonight
- Your age? My age?</i>

1174
01:11:52,228 --> 01:11:54,592
<i>- I don't. You know why?
- Betty Lou</i>

1175
01:11:54,628 --> 01:11:56,994
<i>- 'Cause younger women are nice.
- It's all true</i>

1176
01:11:57,032 --> 01:12:00,262
You take them out,
they're actually grateful.

1177
01:12:00,301 --> 01:12:02,532
<i>- "Oh, look a steak. Yummy. "
- It's really true</i>

1178
01:12:02,570 --> 01:12:04,538
You go for a walk
after dinner

1179
01:12:04,573 --> 01:12:06,541
the air smells nice.
They say, "Thank you.

1180
01:12:06,574 --> 01:12:08,542
"This was nice.

1181
01:12:08,577 --> 01:12:10,543
"This was fun.
You're funny.

1182
01:12:10,578 --> 01:12:12,876
Tee hee. "

1183
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:15,279
What should I do, Terry?
Settle down and marry

1184
01:12:15,315 --> 01:12:17,283
some pissed off
thing like you?

1185
01:12:17,317 --> 01:12:19,716
I'd rather have someone
come over and do dental work

1186
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:21,685
every day,
from my backside

1187
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:24,849
up through my ass.

1188
01:12:24,890 --> 01:12:27,951
<i>Come on!
Play it, Betty Lou</i>

1189
01:12:29,628 --> 01:12:31,595
You gonna slap me
in the face again?

1190
01:12:31,630 --> 01:12:33,597
No, probably not.

1191
01:12:33,631 --> 01:12:35,622
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

1192
01:12:41,805 --> 01:12:44,104
<i>Have you heard
the news?</i>

1193
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,109
<i>It's all over town</i>

1194
01:12:46,143 --> 01:12:48,440
<i>If you ain't heard it, boys,
you'd better sit down</i>

1195
01:12:48,479 --> 01:12:51,470
A vodka and orange
juice, please.

1196
01:12:51,514 --> 01:12:54,346
<i>Brace yourself now
and take a deep breath</i>

1197
01:12:54,384 --> 01:12:57,284
<i>Grab hold of something,
gotta hold on tight</i>

1198
01:12:57,319 --> 01:13:00,220
<i>- Betty Lou's getting out tonight
- There you are.</i>

1199
01:13:00,256 --> 01:13:03,282
<i>First heard the rumor
down on 12th and Main...</i>

1200
01:13:03,324 --> 01:13:06,122
- What did you just say to Shep?
- Nothing.

1201
01:13:07,328 --> 01:13:10,354
He left. He told me he
couldn't handle you anymore.

1202
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:13,025
- What did you say?
- We had a heart to heart.

1203
01:13:13,067 --> 01:13:15,034
It was needed.

1204
01:13:15,069 --> 01:13:18,095
<i>Betty Lou's
getting out tonight</i>

1205
01:13:18,139 --> 01:13:20,630
<i>Betty Lou's getting
out tonight</i>

1206
01:13:20,675 --> 01:13:23,143
<i>Betty Lou's
getting out tonight</i>

1207
01:13:23,176 --> 01:13:26,338
<i>- Dance with me.
- She was bad, her mama got mad</i>

1208
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:29,144
<i>But her mama
said it's all right</i>

1209
01:13:29,181 --> 01:13:32,048
<i>All the boys are getting
ready and right</i>

1210
01:13:32,085 --> 01:13:34,881
<i>Betty Lou's
getting out tonight</i>

1211
01:13:36,788 --> 01:13:38,122
<i>Betty Lou</i>

1212
01:13:38,791 --> 01:13:40,782
<i>Betty Lou</i>

1213
01:13:42,228 --> 01:13:45,060
<i>It's all true</i>

1214
01:13:45,096 --> 01:13:47,894
<i>It's really true</i>

1215
01:13:47,932 --> 01:13:49,900
<i>Well what do you
think about that, boys?</i>

1216
01:13:49,935 --> 01:13:51,926
<i>Come on</i>

1217
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:27,494
Mmm, no.

1218
01:14:27,536 --> 01:14:31,027
Yes?
What?

1219
01:14:31,072 --> 01:14:33,768
Emily, what's up?

1220
01:14:37,711 --> 01:14:39,542
Hold... hold on.
Hold on.

1221
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:42,948
It's... it's Emily.
She's in the hospital.

1222
01:14:42,983 --> 01:14:45,349
What?
Baby?

1223
01:14:45,385 --> 01:14:47,353
- I should go with you.
- No.

1224
01:14:47,386 --> 01:14:49,377
- I should go with you, Terry.
- No.

1225
01:14:50,856 --> 01:14:52,824
That's a long drive
this time of night.

1226
01:14:52,859 --> 01:14:55,452
Oh, no. I need you to stay here
in case Popeye wakes up.

1227
01:14:55,493 --> 01:14:57,461
I don't want her
to be scared, okay?

1228
01:14:57,494 --> 01:15:00,292
I'll be fine.

1229
01:15:03,667 --> 01:15:07,899
<i>Can I help it
if I'm bolder?</i>

1230
01:15:09,239 --> 01:15:11,970
<i>Can I help it
if I'm faithful?</i>

1231
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:13,978
At this point,
I can't say much.

1232
01:15:14,011 --> 01:15:15,979
Could be an ulcer,

1233
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:17,979
could be pancreatic.

1234
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:20,778
I don't know.
I'm at a loss for tonight.

1235
01:15:20,815 --> 01:15:22,783
What?
You're at a loss?

1236
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:25,719
She's in a lot of pain.
I had to put her out and let her sleep.

1237
01:15:25,755 --> 01:15:27,746
I can't do anything
until the morning.

1238
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:30,926
Well, what are you
gonna do in the morning?

1239
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,927
Actually, I won't be here
in the morning.

1240
01:15:32,962 --> 01:15:34,930
I'm at the end
of a long shift,

1241
01:15:34,963 --> 01:15:37,761
but tests will be taken and tomorrow
night, when I come back

1242
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:40,265
- I'll look at them and we'll talk.
- Tomorrow night?

1243
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:42,268
Yes.

1244
01:15:42,301 --> 01:15:44,395
And what if I want
a second opinion?

1245
01:15:45,605 --> 01:15:47,664
Well, I haven't given you
a first one yet.

1246
01:15:47,707 --> 01:15:50,676
And if I want
a second opinion?

1247
01:15:50,711 --> 01:15:53,009
It's 4:30 am.

1248
01:15:53,046 --> 01:15:55,277
I don't think you're going
to get a strong one.

1249
01:16:26,443 --> 01:16:29,240
Well, why would they
do something like that?

1250
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:31,907
Because I didn't give
them candy, that's why.

1251
01:16:31,948 --> 01:16:35,645
Great. You're standing at the door
with a bowl of candy, why can't you...

1252
01:16:35,685 --> 01:16:37,653
Because I don't accept
15-year-old-girls

1253
01:16:37,686 --> 01:16:40,417
with no costume on.
If you don't have a costume on,

1254
01:16:40,457 --> 01:16:42,480
- you shouldn't be allowed...
- Who cares?!

1255
01:16:42,524 --> 01:16:44,548
They're just using
Halloween to get candy!

1256
01:16:44,592 --> 01:16:46,992
Who cares?! It's Halloween!
Just give them candy!

1257
01:16:47,028 --> 01:16:49,757
It's okay to use a holiday for
your own selfish purposes?!

1258
01:16:49,796 --> 01:16:51,423
Oh, so what?!

1259
01:16:51,466 --> 01:16:54,162
So you'd rather just have them
toiletpaper your house?

1260
01:16:54,202 --> 01:16:56,726
Well, I didn't know it was gonna
be "felony or treat!"

1261
01:16:56,770 --> 01:16:58,898
I don't... I didn't think that
trick extended to felony!

1262
01:16:58,939 --> 01:17:00,908
Why would it kill you just to give
'em a few pieces of candy?!

1263
01:17:00,942 --> 01:17:03,238
- I don't understand that!
- Because there's gotta be

1264
01:17:03,275 --> 01:17:05,801
some kind of cut-off!
Shouldn't there be for Halloween?

1265
01:17:05,845 --> 01:17:07,814
Bob, what is with you
and your cut-offs

1266
01:17:07,847 --> 01:17:10,782
and your shouldn't there be
and should there be... who cares?!

1267
01:17:11,783 --> 01:17:13,842
She's really sick.

1268
01:17:13,886 --> 01:17:16,945
And the worst thing is
they don't know what it is.

1269
01:17:16,988 --> 01:17:20,220
I mean, it could be an ulcer,
it could be thyroid.

1270
01:17:20,259 --> 01:17:21,783
It, uh...

1271
01:17:21,827 --> 01:17:23,795
She can't eat and...

1272
01:17:23,828 --> 01:17:25,796
you know,
it could be cancer.

1273
01:17:25,829 --> 01:17:29,060
It could be...
it could be so many things.

1274
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:31,590
I don't know what it is.

1275
01:17:38,242 --> 01:17:40,233
I don't know what it is.

1276
01:17:45,381 --> 01:17:47,610
Oh, God.

1277
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:14,573
Directory assistance.

1278
01:18:14,608 --> 01:18:17,234
Um, yes, operator.
I would like, um,

1279
01:18:17,277 --> 01:18:20,246
I'm looking for directory assistance
for Karlstad, Sweden.

1280
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:23,215
You said
"Karlstad, Sweden?"

1281
01:18:23,248 --> 01:18:25,239
Yes, thank you.

1282
01:18:31,756 --> 01:18:33,747
Look at you
all alone in here.

1283
01:18:35,327 --> 01:18:37,318
I like it like this.

1284
01:18:41,064 --> 01:18:43,055
Did you call Daddy
to tell him?

1285
01:18:44,868 --> 01:18:46,837
Um...

1286
01:18:46,871 --> 01:18:48,860
No, I didn't.

1287
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:00,015
I don't hate him.

1288
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:02,016
I mean, you know,
I know that you do,

1289
01:19:02,051 --> 01:19:04,019
but I've, uh, been
thinking about it,

1290
01:19:04,052 --> 01:19:06,043
and I just don't.

1291
01:19:18,233 --> 01:19:21,030
- Did you talk to the doctor?
- Yes.

1292
01:19:21,069 --> 01:19:23,037
Did he tell you
it wasn't cancer?

1293
01:19:23,070 --> 01:19:25,868
Yes, he did.
Thank God.

1294
01:19:25,905 --> 01:19:28,500
He thinks that whatever it is
might be stress-related.

1295
01:19:30,109 --> 01:19:32,077
An ulcer, maybe.

1296
01:19:32,110 --> 01:19:35,671
He's very worried that you're
under too much stress, Emily.

1297
01:19:35,715 --> 01:19:38,274
- I'm not stressed.
- Yes, you are.

1298
01:19:38,317 --> 01:19:40,284
You are.
You're mad.

1299
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:42,787
Mad at me.
Mad at Daddy.

1300
01:19:42,822 --> 01:19:45,551
I can see that
all the time.

1301
01:19:45,591 --> 01:19:47,421
You've got a cloud
over your head.

1302
01:19:47,458 --> 01:19:49,426
We need to get it
to go away.

1303
01:19:49,461 --> 01:19:52,395
Give you some air.

1304
01:19:52,429 --> 01:19:54,420
The doctor's
very worried, Emily.

1305
01:19:57,333 --> 01:19:59,268
- Maybe yoga.
- Stop it.

1306
01:19:59,302 --> 01:20:01,134
- I'm serious.
- Well, so am I.

1307
01:20:01,171 --> 01:20:03,435
You can't dance or exercise
your way out of this.

1308
01:20:05,042 --> 01:20:07,033
You need to
get better, Emily.

1309
01:20:08,212 --> 01:20:10,179
I can take a lot,

1310
01:20:10,212 --> 01:20:12,543
but I couldn't take
losing you.

1311
01:20:20,188 --> 01:20:22,179
Why is that funny?

1312
01:20:24,725 --> 01:20:28,092
Because you just don't seem
to care all that much about me,

1313
01:20:28,130 --> 01:20:30,097
unless, like now,
I'm sick.

1314
01:20:30,131 --> 01:20:32,099
That's not true.
That's just not true.

1315
01:20:32,132 --> 01:20:33,997
I adore you.

1316
01:20:35,635 --> 01:20:37,966
- You do?
- I do!

1317
01:20:39,171 --> 01:20:41,162
I don't see that.

1318
01:20:43,208 --> 01:20:45,176
Well, what can I say?

1319
01:20:45,211 --> 01:20:46,939
You're like everybody else
in my life

1320
01:20:46,979 --> 01:20:49,413
you need to pay
closer attention to me.

1321
01:20:54,351 --> 01:20:56,546
Okay.

1322
01:21:00,057 --> 01:21:02,025
How's the wind, Dad?

1323
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:05,154
Fantastic!
Whoa! Yeah!

1324
01:21:05,195 --> 01:21:07,186
Far out!

1325
01:21:13,871 --> 01:21:16,359
Woo!

1326
01:21:21,911 --> 01:21:24,470
The only thing
I understand about this...

1327
01:21:25,814 --> 01:21:27,783
is the screaming.

1328
01:21:27,817 --> 01:21:30,809
Whoo!
Hey, hey!

1329
01:21:32,555 --> 01:21:34,523
So, how does
this work now?

1330
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:37,582
- You going next, Gorden?
- Hell no. He won't jump.

1331
01:21:37,625 --> 01:21:40,114
He's too scared.
He's a watcher.

1332
01:21:43,997 --> 01:21:46,226
- You're not gonna jump?
- No, he won't jump.

1333
01:21:46,265 --> 01:21:48,996
I'll go again,
unless you wanna take a shot.

1334
01:21:50,537 --> 01:21:52,505
Nope.
Not me.

1335
01:21:52,538 --> 01:21:54,871
I'm a watcher too.

1336
01:22:07,118 --> 01:22:09,109
Are you gonna marry
my mother?

1337
01:22:14,259 --> 01:22:16,226
I don't know.
It's, um...

1338
01:22:16,261 --> 01:22:18,887
it's tough.
Your mom, she's...

1339
01:22:19,896 --> 01:22:21,864
she's tricky.

1340
01:22:21,899 --> 01:22:23,865
She didn't used to be.

1341
01:22:23,899 --> 01:22:26,595
Ask anyone.
She was always sweet.

1342
01:22:28,938 --> 01:22:31,064
You should
marry her, Denny.

1343
01:22:31,106 --> 01:22:34,270
Would that make you happy?

1344
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:36,301
It would, yeah.

1345
01:22:42,484 --> 01:22:44,452
Mmn.

1346
01:22:44,485 --> 01:22:46,418
So, uh...

1347
01:22:46,453 --> 01:22:48,421
your daughter asked me

1348
01:22:48,456 --> 01:22:51,220
if I was going
to marry you, today.

1349
01:22:51,259 --> 01:22:53,988
Oh, please.
That's a cheap shot.

1350
01:23:00,001 --> 01:23:01,967
What do you mean?
She's, um...

1351
01:23:02,002 --> 01:23:03,970
she's adorable.

1352
01:23:04,003 --> 01:23:05,994
I know she is.

1353
01:23:14,246 --> 01:23:16,213
It wasn't
a cheap shot, Terry.

1354
01:23:16,247 --> 01:23:18,216
What?

1355
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:20,240
Bringing up what...

1356
01:23:22,587 --> 01:23:25,055
bringing up what Popeye said.
It wasn't, um...

1357
01:23:25,088 --> 01:23:27,079
it wasn't a cheap shot.

1358
01:23:28,493 --> 01:23:30,461
I have enough problems
right now, Denny.

1359
01:23:30,494 --> 01:23:32,587
I don't need you using
my daughter as a pawn.

1360
01:23:37,868 --> 01:23:39,859
What are you
talking about?

1361
01:23:43,472 --> 01:23:45,634
I have a child incredibly
ill in the hospital.

1362
01:23:45,675 --> 01:23:48,974
Another one's sleeping with a pervert
that you brought into her life,

1363
01:23:49,011 --> 01:23:50,979
so I don't want to get
into something silly

1364
01:23:51,012 --> 01:23:52,980
like a cute talk
about a marriage

1365
01:23:53,015 --> 01:23:55,243
that we both know would
be doomed from the start,

1366
01:23:55,283 --> 01:23:57,307
so you know what
I'm talking about. Don't.

1367
01:23:57,351 --> 01:23:59,342
I don't wanna hear
what Popeye said, no.

1368
01:24:19,639 --> 01:24:22,539
I am so sick
of being your bitch.

1369
01:24:24,210 --> 01:24:27,542
I put up with your shit,
because I know how much pain you're in.

1370
01:24:27,578 --> 01:24:29,569
But it's enough!

1371
01:24:31,516 --> 01:24:34,110
It's a tall order for a
patient motherfucker,

1372
01:24:34,152 --> 01:24:36,119
and I am the farthest
thing from that

1373
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:38,145
that you're ever
gonna lay eyes on.

1374
01:24:53,235 --> 01:24:56,228
- Denny? - ... tomorrow.
- Can I talk to you for a second?

1375
01:24:56,273 --> 01:24:59,400
Yeah, I, I, I can
do this tomorrow.

1376
01:25:05,613 --> 01:25:07,581
Bad news.
You ready?

1377
01:25:07,614 --> 01:25:10,778
Management has
a bug up their ass.

1378
01:25:10,818 --> 01:25:12,786
Okay, they've been
getting a lot of calls.

1379
01:25:12,819 --> 01:25:14,787
I've been trying to
keep this from you,

1380
01:25:14,822 --> 01:25:16,813
but they want
to renegotiate.

1381
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,858
Renegotiate what?

1382
01:25:20,895 --> 01:25:23,055
Come on,
you know what.

1383
01:25:23,096 --> 01:25:24,893
They want you
to talk baseball.

1384
01:25:24,931 --> 01:25:26,922
What?

1385
01:25:26,966 --> 01:25:29,832
Either that or they want
to take us off the air.

1386
01:25:31,837 --> 01:25:34,567
- Good gag.
- It's not a gag, Denny.

1387
01:25:34,606 --> 01:25:36,471
I wish it was a gag.
It's not a gag.

1388
01:25:36,509 --> 01:25:39,136
You either talk baseball,
or we go off the air next week.

1389
01:25:39,177 --> 01:25:41,543
- I don't wanna talk baseball.
- Big deal.

1390
01:25:41,581 --> 01:25:43,480
They didn't want to have a sports
talk show in the middle of a day

1391
01:25:43,515 --> 01:25:45,881
with an all-rock format,
but I talked them into it.

1392
01:25:45,917 --> 01:25:48,476
Guess what?
You're a baseball star.

1393
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:52,250
That's what people want to hear
from you. Baseball talk.

1394
01:25:52,288 --> 01:25:55,189
Nobody wants to hear your cooking
and your stock tips, Denny.

1395
01:25:55,225 --> 01:25:57,216
I'm sorry,
but it's true.

1396
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,199
Saturday. Baseball talk.
They may even promo it.

1397
01:26:08,704 --> 01:26:12,265
Okay, Arthur, you're on in 5, 4, 3, 2...
better yet, you're on. Go.

1398
01:26:12,306 --> 01:26:14,969
All right, 101 WRIF, Detroit's home
of rock 'n' roll...

1399
01:26:32,158 --> 01:26:34,921
You're not even
gonna talk to me?

1400
01:26:34,961 --> 01:26:36,792
Denny?

1401
01:26:36,829 --> 01:26:39,712
I called you
eight times today.

1402
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:41,434
Denny.

1403
01:26:42,041 --> 01:26:43,301
Denny.

1404
01:26:43,336 --> 01:26:45,395
Hey, come on.

1405
01:26:46,405 --> 01:26:48,840
I was in a bad mood, okay?

1406
01:26:48,875 --> 01:26:50,774
Denny?

1407
01:26:50,810 --> 01:26:52,777
I want you
to talk to me.

1408
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:04,188
So, I brought
baby pictures.

1409
01:27:04,689 --> 01:27:06,179
Oh, I wish you'd
brought him.

1410
01:27:06,224 --> 01:27:08,123
He's with the nanny,
we needed a night off.

1411
01:27:08,158 --> 01:27:10,957
So it's done? They're gonna build
a subdivision back there?

1412
01:27:10,994 --> 01:27:12,984
Yeah, next month,
they break ground.

1413
01:27:14,631 --> 01:27:16,597
It's gonna change
the view.

1414
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:18,622
The view
could use changing.

1415
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:23,536
She's coming, okay?
Big smiles...

1416
01:27:23,572 --> 01:27:25,539
and compliments,
but normal though.

1417
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:27,542
Everything's normal,
she looks great,

1418
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:30,203
you're great.
Everything's calm.

1419
01:27:30,246 --> 01:27:33,043
- Calm and great.
- Yes, all of us.

1420
01:27:33,082 --> 01:27:35,207
Why don't you just put
some valium in her soup?

1421
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,217
Don't test me tonight,
Hadley, I mean it.

1422
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,242
I want her calm.

1423
01:27:43,556 --> 01:27:45,524
- Hey you.
- Hey.

1424
01:27:45,559 --> 01:27:48,721
- Hi.
- Look at you. You look beautiful.

1425
01:27:48,761 --> 01:27:51,730
No, you really do.
You look fantastic.

1426
01:27:55,635 --> 01:27:57,626
What?

1427
01:28:00,372 --> 01:28:03,033
So... David and I
have some news.

1428
01:28:05,644 --> 01:28:08,340
- We're pregnant again.
- Jesus.

1429
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:11,712
Really?
Wow.

1430
01:28:19,989 --> 01:28:22,823
You... are...

1431
01:28:26,762 --> 01:28:29,287
Well, you... you don't
look stressed out to me.

1432
01:28:29,332 --> 01:28:31,630
What do you know?
You're a child.

1433
01:29:08,435 --> 01:29:11,130
Wh... what do you mean you want
to end it? You're dumping me?

1434
01:29:11,170 --> 01:29:14,002
No, not really.

1435
01:29:14,038 --> 01:29:16,769
I just...
want us to move on...

1436
01:29:16,809 --> 01:29:19,868
- see other people.
- And continue seeing each other?

1437
01:29:21,979 --> 01:29:24,608
No, probably not.

1438
01:29:24,649 --> 01:29:27,015
So, you don't want to
sleep together anymore?

1439
01:29:27,051 --> 01:29:29,814
I mean, did I do something wrong,
'cause we were doing great.

1440
01:29:29,854 --> 01:29:31,547
I can't believe
we're hearing this.

1441
01:29:31,587 --> 01:29:34,181
Hey, don't turn around, man.
Just pretend we're in a meeting, okay.

1442
01:29:34,224 --> 01:29:36,192
Is this because your
mother detests me?

1443
01:29:36,225 --> 01:29:38,421
'Cause that's not a big deal.
A lot of people do.

1444
01:29:38,462 --> 01:29:41,487
I, I, I wouldn't have the things
that I have in my life

1445
01:29:41,530 --> 01:29:44,363
if people detesting me
was a big deal, 'cause it isn't.

1446
01:29:44,399 --> 01:29:46,425
It's not about my mother,
Shep, It's me.

1447
01:29:46,469 --> 01:29:48,698
Is it 'cause I've been
falling asleep lately?

1448
01:29:49,971 --> 01:29:52,202
Been, y-y-you know, quick,
whatever you're saying?

1449
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:55,470
'Cause I'm tired,
but basically the sex is good, right?

1450
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:58,274
I don't know.
Yeah, I guess.

1451
01:29:58,313 --> 01:30:00,280
You guess?

1452
01:30:00,314 --> 01:30:03,146
You make a lot of noise
and a lot of very odd sounds

1453
01:30:03,184 --> 01:30:05,175
for someone that guesses.

1454
01:30:06,287 --> 01:30:08,755
I guess I've just gotten
good at faking it.

1455
01:30:13,527 --> 01:30:15,154
I'm sorry.

1456
01:30:15,195 --> 01:30:18,595
Okay, look, I just
want to move on with my life.

1457
01:30:19,666 --> 01:30:21,657
I'm sorry.

1458
01:30:23,635 --> 01:30:26,296
Don't be sorry.
Don't be sorry.

1459
01:30:26,337 --> 01:30:28,738
You know what?

1460
01:30:28,774 --> 01:30:31,140
It was inevitable.
Don't be sorry.

1461
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:33,302
You're right.
It was bound to happen.

1462
01:30:33,345 --> 01:30:36,542
- Right?
- Yeah, I guess so.

1463
01:30:36,582 --> 01:30:38,548
Okay.

1464
01:30:38,582 --> 01:30:40,551
We gonna be able to
work together?

1465
01:30:40,585 --> 01:30:43,644
I mean... me producing morning
drive and you in the afternoons?

1466
01:30:47,323 --> 01:30:49,121
Yeah. Yeah,
it's gonna be fine.

1467
01:30:49,158 --> 01:30:50,956
- Okay.
- It's gonna be fine. It doesn't matter

1468
01:30:50,993 --> 01:30:53,154
'cause you're not gonna
be here that much longer anyway.

1469
01:30:53,195 --> 01:30:56,393
- What?
- This place is too small-time for you.

1470
01:30:56,432 --> 01:30:58,229
You're gonna be
long gone, real soon.

1471
01:30:58,268 --> 01:31:01,828
Now he's kissing
her ass, now?

1472
01:31:01,871 --> 01:31:03,838
Okay, I gotta get
back to work.

1473
01:31:03,872 --> 01:31:06,841
- All right? Okay.
- Go, go, go.

1474
01:31:41,740 --> 01:31:44,538
- Hello?
- Hey, come to the window.

1475
01:31:44,577 --> 01:31:46,542
What?

1476
01:31:46,577 --> 01:31:48,568
Come to the window.

1477
01:31:53,783 --> 01:31:56,082
I'm not a liar.

1478
01:31:56,119 --> 01:31:57,849
I really do bungee jump.

1479
01:32:00,957 --> 01:32:02,948
You are so stoned.

1480
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,051
Yeah, I know.

1481
01:32:08,796 --> 01:32:10,315
Whoa!

1482
01:32:10,798 --> 01:32:12,630
Whoa!

1483
01:32:12,667 --> 01:32:15,101
Oh!

1484
01:32:15,136 --> 01:32:17,127
Gorden, shh.

1485
01:32:18,472 --> 01:32:20,600
Oh!
Hold it.

1486
01:32:20,641 --> 01:32:22,371
Whoa!
Whoa!

1487
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:27,167
Don't worry about that.
Go to the back and start working.

1488
01:33:27,203 --> 01:33:29,228
All right, all right,
I got it.

1489
01:33:58,663 --> 01:34:01,359
Oh, hey.

1490
01:34:01,399 --> 01:34:03,390
Hello, Shep.
How are you?

1491
01:34:04,569 --> 01:34:06,560
I'm doin' good.
How are you?

1492
01:34:08,672 --> 01:34:11,335
- You and Denny still not talkin'?
- No.

1493
01:34:11,376 --> 01:34:13,604
No, it's been awhile.
You know, it's been hard.

1494
01:34:14,712 --> 01:34:16,680
You know...

1495
01:34:16,713 --> 01:34:19,181
I'm not as bad as you have
me painted out to be, Terry.

1496
01:34:19,216 --> 01:34:21,184
Just so you know.
I promised myself

1497
01:34:21,217 --> 01:34:23,208
if I ever ran into you,
I would say that.

1498
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:26,511
So there, I said it.

1499
01:34:28,490 --> 01:34:30,890
I should come over
some night with a bottle,

1500
01:34:30,926 --> 01:34:32,757
and you and I
should sit and talk.

1501
01:34:32,796 --> 01:34:35,194
- God...
- What?

1502
01:34:35,229 --> 01:34:37,960
What? You gave me that whole
lecture at Hadley's wedding.

1503
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,230
- What lecture?
- About sleeping with women my own age.

1504
01:34:42,904 --> 01:34:45,533
You know, I'd love to sit
with you and talk to you

1505
01:34:45,573 --> 01:34:47,541
and give you my side
of that story.

1506
01:34:47,574 --> 01:34:49,838
You know, without
getting slapped around.

1507
01:34:49,877 --> 01:34:52,175
Oh, so you wanna come over
and sleep with me?

1508
01:34:52,212 --> 01:34:55,204
- Is that it, Shep?
- No, I didn't say that.

1509
01:34:55,248 --> 01:34:57,045
I said I'd like to have
a drink with you.

1510
01:34:57,083 --> 01:34:59,074
Hey, I'm not
drinking, okay?

1511
01:35:01,188 --> 01:35:03,155
Good, then we'll hang!

1512
01:35:03,189 --> 01:35:04,817
We'll hang...

1513
01:35:04,858 --> 01:35:07,257
or talk about you and Denny.
I mean, this is silly,

1514
01:35:07,293 --> 01:35:09,488
- you guys should be talking.
- It's silly, huh?

1515
01:35:09,528 --> 01:35:11,894
So you wanna tell me how
to live my life? Is that it?

1516
01:35:11,930 --> 01:35:14,490
Oh, God. Shep, you know, you were doing
better when you just wanted to screw me.

1517
01:35:14,533 --> 01:35:17,329
- What was that?!
- Hey...

1518
01:35:17,368 --> 01:35:19,336
you are a piece of work.
I gotta shop.

1519
01:35:19,369 --> 01:35:21,930
- Move back.
- Go.

1520
01:35:21,972 --> 01:35:23,940
Go.

1521
01:35:23,975 --> 01:35:25,966
- Go.
- Shep!

1522
01:35:30,747 --> 01:35:33,443
Oh, Jeez!

1523
01:35:33,484 --> 01:35:35,713
Just for the record,
I never wanted to screw you!

1524
01:35:35,752 --> 01:35:37,742
Got it, got it.

1525
01:35:47,630 --> 01:35:50,359
Heavens to Murgatroids.
It's Denny Davies.

1526
01:35:50,399 --> 01:35:52,867
That promo's on disk two,
loaded and ready to go, Art.

1527
01:35:52,902 --> 01:35:55,563
You hit on Terry?

1528
01:35:55,604 --> 01:35:58,333
- What?
- You hit on Terry in a grocery store?

1529
01:35:59,907 --> 01:36:01,703
You guys are talking now.
That's good.

1530
01:36:01,742 --> 01:36:04,369
We are now. We're talking about
what an asshole you are.

1531
01:36:04,411 --> 01:36:06,970
Come on. I was talking
about something very innocent.

1532
01:36:07,014 --> 01:36:08,981
I was gonna pay
a little social call.

1533
01:36:09,015 --> 01:36:11,484
No, you wanted to go over
there with a bottle of wine.

1534
01:36:11,519 --> 01:36:14,180
You wanted to...
you wanted to screw her.

1535
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:16,188
Screw her?

1536
01:36:16,221 --> 01:36:18,280
No, I didn't.

1537
01:36:18,323 --> 01:36:20,722
I wa... I was talking about
something very innocent.

1538
01:36:20,759 --> 01:36:22,726
Right out of "Gunsmoke. "

1539
01:36:22,761 --> 01:36:24,729
This is the problem
with being a deviant,

1540
01:36:24,762 --> 01:36:26,662
everyone sees you
as so one-dimensional.

1541
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:29,292
Don't... no, don't do your rap on me.
I know you.

1542
01:36:29,333 --> 01:36:30,801
You were hitting on her.

1543
01:36:30,836 --> 01:36:33,304
I wasn't hitting on her, Den.
You're over-reacting.

1544
01:36:33,337 --> 01:36:35,238
Yeah, you were and
I'll tell you something else.

1545
01:36:35,274 --> 01:36:37,002
The whole Andy thing?
That was wrong.

1546
01:36:37,042 --> 01:36:39,009
It should have
never happened.

1547
01:36:39,042 --> 01:36:41,908
You had no business
being with her daughter.

1548
01:36:41,944 --> 01:36:44,640
I should've
said something. I...

1549
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:46,671
- Go, Art.
- I don't know why I didn't.

1550
01:36:48,851 --> 01:36:50,819
Terry's right
to despise you.

1551
01:36:50,854 --> 01:36:52,412
She's right
to despise me?

1552
01:36:52,454 --> 01:36:54,582
What are you, a victim
of Stockholm Syndrome?

1553
01:36:54,623 --> 01:36:56,488
Come on. This is me.
Don't do this.

1554
01:36:56,525 --> 01:36:58,493
I knocked off
a great piece of ass...

1555
01:36:58,528 --> 01:37:01,189
What the fuck
are you doing?!

1556
01:37:01,229 --> 01:37:03,890
Shep, stop it!
Just stop it.

1557
01:37:16,144 --> 01:37:18,112
Okay, Arthur,
do your list...

1558
01:37:18,145 --> 01:37:21,945
and your promo and the give-away
Go right into the give-away.

1559
01:37:21,983 --> 01:37:25,212
You know what, Denny?
Everybody won here.

1560
01:37:25,251 --> 01:37:28,448
Okay? She went from being
a production assistant

1561
01:37:28,487 --> 01:37:31,456
to a producer in record time,
so you do the math.

1562
01:37:36,229 --> 01:37:38,197
I'll talk baseball.
I will...

1563
01:37:38,230 --> 01:37:41,631
but I don't want you producing
my show anymore, Shep.

1564
01:37:41,667 --> 01:37:44,032
I'm done with you.
I mean, I'll say what they want,

1565
01:37:44,069 --> 01:37:46,036
but you're off
of my show.

1566
01:37:46,069 --> 01:37:47,627
Now you want
to tell them,

1567
01:37:47,671 --> 01:37:49,639
or should I?

1568
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:58,871
Sorry, Arthur.

1569
01:38:04,587 --> 01:38:06,578
It's not your year,
is it, Sparky?

1570
01:38:28,341 --> 01:38:30,707
- Do you want me to dry your back?
- Jesus!

1571
01:38:30,744 --> 01:38:32,404
Oh, you scared
the hell out of me.

1572
01:38:33,412 --> 01:38:35,381
Oh!

1573
01:38:35,414 --> 01:38:38,179
You have no boundaries.

1574
01:38:41,688 --> 01:38:43,679
You have quite an ass,
know that?

1575
01:38:45,324 --> 01:38:47,292
What are you doing?

1576
01:38:48,293 --> 01:38:50,261
Have a drink?

1577
01:38:50,296 --> 01:38:52,855
No thanks.

1578
01:38:52,898 --> 01:38:55,524
Just, um... I'm not
drinking right now.

1579
01:39:17,453 --> 01:39:19,444
Do you want
to stay for dinner?

1580
01:39:21,189 --> 01:39:23,555
What do you think?

1581
01:39:25,027 --> 01:39:27,791
I didn't just come over
to see you naked.

1582
01:39:27,829 --> 01:39:29,819
You know,
been there, done that.

1583
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:38,261
Gonna be late, ladies!

1584
01:39:45,378 --> 01:39:47,369
Let's move!

1585
01:39:57,789 --> 01:39:59,757
Thanks for going to this.

1586
01:39:59,792 --> 01:40:02,122
Oh, I know it means
a lot to you.

1587
01:40:04,895 --> 01:40:07,831
Mom, did you call him?
Did you ever call him?

1588
01:40:09,868 --> 01:40:11,858
No, I didn't.

1589
01:40:13,069 --> 01:40:15,037
And you know... you know,
I don't need to.

1590
01:40:15,072 --> 01:40:16,936
The doctor says
you're improving.

1591
01:40:18,641 --> 01:40:21,202
You're not wiggin' out about this,
are you? Stressing out?

1592
01:40:22,412 --> 01:40:24,380
Jeez.

1593
01:40:24,413 --> 01:40:26,381
Terry?

1594
01:40:26,416 --> 01:40:29,078
I don't mean to be the girl here,
but we're gonna be late.

1595
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,994
People don't know
how to love.

1596
01:42:03,037 --> 01:42:05,596
They bite
rather than kiss,

1597
01:42:05,639 --> 01:42:08,766
and they slap
rather than stroke.

1598
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:14,704
Maybe it's because they realize
how easy it is for love to go bad,

1599
01:42:14,747 --> 01:42:18,011
to become
suddenly impossible...

1600
01:42:18,050 --> 01:42:21,645
unworkable,
an exercise in futility.

1601
01:42:21,686 --> 01:42:24,587
So they avoid it and
seek solace in angst

1602
01:42:24,622 --> 01:42:26,591
and fear
and aggression,

1603
01:42:26,625 --> 01:42:28,819
which are always there
and readily available.

1604
01:42:28,860 --> 01:42:31,591
Or maybe sometimes...

1605
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:33,597
they just don't have
all the facts.

1606
01:43:18,739 --> 01:43:20,729
In here?

1607
01:43:32,051 --> 01:43:34,042
Holy mother of shit.

1608
01:43:36,221 --> 01:43:37,746
What is it?

1609
01:43:38,123 --> 01:43:40,114
What is it?

1610
01:43:42,961 --> 01:43:44,952
What is it?

1611
01:43:55,038 --> 01:43:57,734
You'd better go back, okay?
Just...

1612
01:43:57,774 --> 01:44:00,140
- I'll be right there. Look... no, no.
- No, what is it?

1613
01:44:00,176 --> 01:44:02,167
We pulled this jacket up,
found a wallet.

1614
01:44:21,729 --> 01:44:23,525
Go back, Terry.
Look, I mean it, honey.

1615
01:44:23,564 --> 01:44:26,088
- I mean it. Go back, go back
- No, I don't wanna go back.

1616
01:44:26,132 --> 01:44:28,123
Terry, please.

1617
01:44:32,271 --> 01:44:33,932
- Give me the flashlight.
- Baby, no.

1618
01:44:33,974 --> 01:44:35,532
- No.
- Give it to me. Give it to me.

1619
01:44:35,574 --> 01:44:37,735
Give me the flashlight, Denny.
Give it to me!

1620
01:45:09,105 --> 01:45:11,073
It's an old water well.

1621
01:45:11,108 --> 01:45:13,099
All covered up.

1622
01:45:20,248 --> 01:45:22,216
He must have...

1623
01:45:22,251 --> 01:45:24,219
come out to walk
the property

1624
01:45:24,252 --> 01:45:26,243
and fallen through.

1625
01:46:17,033 --> 01:46:20,400
You guys sh-should
go call the police.

1626
01:46:45,461 --> 01:46:47,427
Oh, my God.

1627
01:46:47,462 --> 01:46:49,453
Oh, God.

1628
01:48:10,703 --> 01:48:12,671
...to honor...

1629
01:48:14,507 --> 01:48:16,474
...our sense of loss.

1630
01:48:16,507 --> 01:48:18,475
What is the price
we've paid?

1631
01:48:18,510 --> 01:48:20,501
What is the price
we've paid for...

1632
01:49:16,064 --> 01:49:19,328
Anger and resentment
can stop you in your tracks.

1633
01:49:21,835 --> 01:49:24,394
That's what I know now.

1634
01:49:24,436 --> 01:49:26,631
It needs nothing to burn
but the air and the life

1635
01:49:26,671 --> 01:49:28,662
that it swallows
and smothers.

1636
01:50:04,841 --> 01:50:07,274
- What? What?
- Okay.

1637
01:50:07,310 --> 01:50:08,832
Whoa!

1638
01:50:15,850 --> 01:50:17,819
It's real, though...

1639
01:50:17,853 --> 01:50:20,185
the fury,

1640
01:50:20,221 --> 01:50:23,314
even when it isn't.

1641
01:50:23,356 --> 01:50:25,324
It can change you...

1642
01:50:25,359 --> 01:50:27,452
turn you...

1643
01:50:27,494 --> 01:50:30,259
mold you and shape you
into someone you're not.

1644
01:50:33,365 --> 01:50:36,301
The only upside
to anger, then...

1645
01:50:36,336 --> 01:50:38,304
is the person you become...

1646
01:50:38,337 --> 01:50:40,328
Good job.

1647
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:45,172
...hopefully someone
that wakes up one day

1648
01:50:45,210 --> 01:50:47,974
and realizes they're
not afraid of its journey,

1649
01:50:49,782 --> 01:50:52,649
someone that knows
that the truth is, at best,

1650
01:50:52,685 --> 01:50:54,652
a partially told story.

1651
01:50:54,685 --> 01:50:57,086
That anger,
like growth,

1652
01:50:57,121 --> 01:50:59,088
comes in spurts and fits

1653
01:50:59,122 --> 01:51:00,988
and in its wake,

1654
01:51:01,024 --> 01:51:04,255
leaves a new chance
at acceptance

1655
01:51:04,293 --> 01:51:06,284
and the promise of calm.

1656
01:51:09,565 --> 01:51:13,229
Then again,
what do I know?

1657
01:51:13,270 --> 01:51:15,238
I'm only a child.

1658
01:51:18,046 --> 01:51:21,756
<i>How many roads
you've traveled</i>

1659
01:51:24,359 --> 01:51:27,988
