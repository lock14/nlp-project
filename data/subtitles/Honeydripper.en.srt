00:40:53,057 --> 00:40:57,341
Here's my baby. What's up, Ty?
How your mama doing, China Doll?

519
00:40:57,376 --> 00:40:59,305
She doing fine, Uncle Shack.

520
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:02,303
I'm just telling the boys here
about how Brother Randolph

521
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:05,697
pushing this deal how boys are gonna
be a full part of the service.

522
00:41:05,732 --> 00:41:07,401
I carried a rifle in the Great War.

523
00:41:08,136 --> 00:41:09,755
Boys get in the middle of this Korea mess,

524
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,740
they ain't gonna thank you
for your efforts.

525
00:41:12,525 --> 00:41:16,083
If we want our full due in this
country, we've got to go whole hog!

526
00:41:16,118 --> 00:41:19,401
Black folk shooting yellow folk
to keep white folks happy?

527
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:22,005
We need to move on
from that kind of thinking.

528
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:26,318
Move right on, Shack. Then come back
and tell the rest of us how it is.

529
00:41:26,353 --> 00:41:27,757
[ LAUGHTER ]

530
00:41:30,496 --> 00:41:32,235
That's a hard headed man.

531
00:41:34,255 --> 00:41:36,998
I'd have to ask Mr Skinner.
- Of course you would.

532
00:41:37,983 --> 00:41:41,382
While you're at it, remind him how one
of the reasons coloured folks come here

533
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:43,521
is to get the low-down
on what's happening.

534
00:41:43,856 --> 00:41:45,104
China doll!

535
00:41:45,356 --> 00:41:47,504
You gonna let us put up these posters,
ain't ya, Luther?

536
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:50,343
Oh, I don't think there'll be
any problem at all.

537
00:41:50,378 --> 00:41:54,336
That's awful nice of you, Luther.
- You're looking special today.

538
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:56,020
That's sweet of you to say.

539
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,179
Maceo, you go with the man here,

540
00:41:58,214 --> 00:42:00,358
he'll show you where to put these up.

541
00:42:00,593 --> 00:42:03,772
Darling, we've got a lot
of more places to go.

542
00:42:04,207 --> 00:42:05,951
Nice to see you, Luther!

543
00:42:15,007 --> 00:42:17,806
You've got that boy
eating out of your hand!

544
00:42:17,841 --> 00:42:20,605
Luther is the only one didn't pull my hair,

545
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,609
he sat behind me in Sunday school.

546
00:42:22,644 --> 00:42:24,593
I hope you got a little
of that sugar left, cos

547
00:42:24,594 --> 00:42:26,542
we got to spare some on
Miss Bertha Mae Spivey.

548
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,898
You gonna ask her to come sing again?
- No. I'm gonna ask her for money.

549
00:42:29,933 --> 00:42:32,919
Word is, she got a whole pile
of it squirrelled away.

550
00:42:33,454 --> 00:42:34,357
Daddy...

551
00:42:34,454 --> 00:42:35,957
Hey, come on, girl.
We in a rush here.

552
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:37,457
I got to rest.

553
00:42:39,796 --> 00:42:43,400
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

554
00:42:43,835 --> 00:42:45,954
You catch your breath here, OK.

555
00:42:46,989 --> 00:42:47,693
Yeah.

556
00:42:49,893 --> 00:42:53,256
So why Miss Spivey gonna give you money,

557
00:42:53,291 --> 00:42:55,350
you don't let her sing at the club no more?

558
00:42:55,485 --> 00:42:58,409
I'm gonna make her partner.
- Partner in what?

559
00:42:58,444 --> 00:42:59,893
The Honeydripper.

560
00:43:00,428 --> 00:43:04,246
But all you ever say, it's just
a hole you pour good money into.

561
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:06,885
It don't matter.
I'm gonna make her proprietor.

562
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,163
'Tress'. Like waiter and waitress.

563
00:43:11,682 --> 00:43:13,527
Proprietress.

564
00:43:13,562 --> 00:43:15,961
She got to like the sound of that.

565
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:22,763
Lovely ladies out to make a purchase.

566
00:43:22,998 --> 00:43:25,157
Is that the same Guitar Sam
that's on the radio?

567
00:43:25,198 --> 00:43:26,157
The very one.

568
00:43:26,392 --> 00:43:27,501
What's he look like?

569
00:43:27,936 --> 00:43:32,614
Fine looking man,
a real lady killer from what I hear.

570
00:43:32,949 --> 00:43:35,138
Got that New Orleans style to him.

571
00:43:35,473 --> 00:43:36,947
Well, you ought to have a picture up there.

572
00:43:37,122 --> 00:43:39,671
We'll be getting some of those
when he come in on the train.

573
00:43:40,206 --> 00:43:43,548
Main thing is, the man is electrifying

574
00:43:43,983 --> 00:43:46,027
and you know what that means.

575
00:43:46,962 --> 00:43:47,997
OK.

576
00:43:50,946 --> 00:43:55,109
Make like we just come by
to see how how she keeping.

577
00:43:55,344 --> 00:43:59,502
Then I'll kind of mention I'd been
thinking of bringing her on as a partner.

578
00:44:01,541 --> 00:44:03,061
Left the door open.

579
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:18,695
She gone.

580
00:44:19,534 --> 00:44:23,871
Oh. When she going to be back?

581
00:44:25,851 --> 00:44:27,370
She's gone.

582
00:44:32,528 --> 00:44:34,047
Woke up beside her.

583
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,919
Oh, damn.

584
00:44:54,954 --> 00:44:56,038
24 years.

585
00:44:57,757 --> 00:44:59,441
China doll, go find your mama.

586
00:44:59,876 --> 00:45:01,635
She'll know how to fix up the body.

587
00:45:07,113 --> 00:45:09,272
Laugh and all but...

588
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:13,510
.. I've been with that woman
24 years.

589
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:18,628
She gave me the only home I ever had.

590
00:45:22,627 --> 00:45:24,066
What am I gonna do now?

591
00:45:50,555 --> 00:45:52,094
What's your hurry, boy?

592
00:45:53,733 --> 00:45:55,213
No hurry.

593
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:58,091
Take your hat off.

594
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:01,549
Where you headed?

595
00:46:02,184 --> 00:46:03,774
I'm looking for work.

596
00:46:04,509 --> 00:46:05,728
You're not from around here?

597
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:07,612
No, sir.

598
00:46:08,847 --> 00:46:11,785
Stranger wandering around, no job,

599
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:14,024
that would make you a vagrant.

600
00:46:14,759 --> 00:46:16,363
But I'm looking.

601
00:46:18,602 --> 00:46:20,801
I got a job for you.
Get in the back.

602
00:46:44,032 --> 00:46:46,036
I can always use another hand.

603
00:46:46,371 --> 00:46:51,328
Well, I caught this young fella in
flagrant violation of the statutes...

604
00:46:51,363 --> 00:46:53,487
gawkery, with intent to mope.

605
00:46:55,006 --> 00:46:56,571
What's he going to run me?

606
00:46:56,606 --> 00:46:59,190
3 a day, plus you feed him lunch.

607
00:46:59,925 --> 00:47:03,623
The sentence, that all depends on how
long you're gonna need the help?

608
00:47:03,958 --> 00:47:05,367
I don't get any trial?

609
00:47:05,802 --> 00:47:08,961
Sure you do, boy, and a speedy
one at that. Meet the judge.

610
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:10,897
Judge Gatlin.

611
00:47:10,932 --> 00:47:12,799
Grab a sack.

612
00:47:18,837 --> 00:47:21,596
Oh dear, I believe it's about that time.

613
00:47:24,234 --> 00:47:26,353
Would you care to join me?
- No, thank you.

614
00:47:29,512 --> 00:47:31,991
Of course you won't join me,
you don't partake.

615
00:47:32,026 --> 00:47:34,439
That was thoughtless of me.

616
00:47:34,824 --> 00:47:36,789
No, that's all right.

617
00:47:39,787 --> 00:47:45,945
So, you don't take spirits
and what else in your church?

618
00:47:47,384 --> 00:47:51,667
I'm sort of between churches
- Oh.

619
00:47:53,702 --> 00:47:56,440
I've been thinking about
changing over to the Holiness,

620
00:47:57,675 --> 00:47:59,859
but I haven't been sanctified yet.

621
00:47:59,994 --> 00:48:01,278
Oh.

622
00:48:05,696 --> 00:48:09,254
There's been a minister in this week.

623
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:11,813
The tent over by the fairgrounds?

624
00:48:14,972 --> 00:48:18,431
The church I was raised in,
we were Pentecostals.

625
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:26,588
They wouldn't have anything but
the human voice inside the church.

626
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:30,346
Dancing, any kind of dancing,

627
00:48:30,381 --> 00:48:32,203
music, card-playing.

628
00:48:32,238 --> 00:48:34,025
It was very strict.

629
00:48:37,443 --> 00:48:39,001
They took up serpents.

630
00:48:39,136 --> 00:48:40,706
I heard of that.

631
00:48:40,741 --> 00:48:45,299
I tell Floyd these stories,
and he's... He's horrified.

632
00:48:46,718 --> 00:48:49,542
They have always been Methodists,
Floyd's family.

633
00:48:49,577 --> 00:48:53,316
It can be a trial, married folks
differ in their religion.

634
00:48:53,951 --> 00:48:55,795
And your husband is a...?

635
00:48:59,473 --> 00:49:00,778
Unaffiliated.

636
00:49:01,113 --> 00:49:03,632
Unaffiliated, I see.

637
00:49:06,691 --> 00:49:08,874
But he has his social club.

638
00:49:08,909 --> 00:49:12,468
The Honeydripper?
- That is such a colourful name.

639
00:49:12,503 --> 00:49:13,986
Yes.

640
00:49:17,745 --> 00:49:21,903
He must devote a great deal
of his energy to it.

641
00:49:21,938 --> 00:49:24,427
It's just him and Maceo Green runs it,

642
00:49:24,662 --> 00:49:27,705
I go over and cook some
after I get off here.

643
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:34,198
Well, that's very supportive of you,
considering the sort of environment.

644
00:49:34,243 --> 00:49:37,177
I've been in those bar rooms
most of my life, Miss Amanda.

645
00:49:40,306 --> 00:49:41,785
I see.

646
00:49:49,302 --> 00:49:50,840
I was a singer.

647
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,978
I met Tyrone in the Paradise,
down in Treefork.

648
00:49:56,313 --> 00:49:57,938
China doll was only two.

649
00:49:59,757 --> 00:50:02,001
And I was just...

650
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,394
living alone, you know,

651
00:50:05,929 --> 00:50:07,973
drinking more than I ought,

652
00:50:08,808 --> 00:50:10,393
and then Tyrone...

653
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:15,006
.. Like a light, come into my life.

654
00:50:15,541 --> 00:50:18,809
People think things cos he owns the lounge,

655
00:50:19,214 --> 00:50:21,258
but they don't know him.

656
00:50:23,178 --> 00:50:26,056
Small minds are never in short supply.

657
00:50:28,815 --> 00:50:31,094
People in this town...

658
00:50:36,971 --> 00:50:42,429
I suppose they expected that Floyd,
being from a prominent family,

659
00:50:43,904 --> 00:50:47,507
as prominent as is possible
here in Harmony,

660
00:50:47,642 --> 00:50:51,085
would have chosen somebody more...

661
00:50:56,323 --> 00:50:59,282
In school, if you didn't have shoes...

662
00:51:05,818 --> 00:51:08,017
Oh, I forgot!

663
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:26,310
I was going through some of Emily's
old things the other day.

664
00:51:26,745 --> 00:51:29,709
I thought this would look
just darling on your China Doll.

665
00:51:31,998 --> 00:51:34,687
Oh, I don't think that would
near fit her, Miss Amanda.

666
00:51:35,122 --> 00:51:37,485
Why, how old is she, now?

667
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,005
17...

668
00:51:41,363 --> 00:51:42,843
Oh, my...

669
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:48,520
I must have lost track
somewhere along the line.

670
00:51:48,555 --> 00:51:50,164
17?

671
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:52,878
It was a very nice thought.

672
00:51:54,938 --> 00:51:57,277
- Mama, mama, they need you at...

673
00:51:59,196 --> 00:52:00,200
Oh, I'm sorry.

674
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:04,998
Miss Amanda, I didn't know...
- China Doll!

675
00:52:05,533 --> 00:52:09,612
We were just recalling
how you used to play right here,

676
00:52:09,947 --> 00:52:10,971
under this table.

677
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:16,488
There's not any cash money that I know of.

678
00:52:16,823 --> 00:52:19,452
She sold a good deal of the furniture,

679
00:52:19,487 --> 00:52:23,165
but there's still a nice looking
couch in the parlour.

680
00:52:24,885 --> 00:52:28,328
Didn't care about too much,

681
00:52:28,363 --> 00:52:31,802
other than singing at the Pine Top's place.

682
00:52:32,437 --> 00:52:33,768
You're welcome to look around the house,

683
00:52:33,903 --> 00:52:35,765
if there's anything your missus might like.

684
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,279
As long as it's not something
personal to me and Bertha Mae.

685
00:52:39,864 --> 00:52:42,007
It's just...

686
00:52:43,027 --> 00:52:45,066
She's got to go out in style.

687
00:53:32,535 --> 00:53:35,934
You ain't never done this job before?
- Can't say I have.

688
00:53:37,453 --> 00:53:43,001
You want to set your pins out wide,
bend over at the hip.

689
00:53:43,206 --> 00:53:46,469

01:21:15,655 --> 01:21:18,596
All kinds of spangly pants and jacket!

1035
01:21:19,231 --> 01:21:22,337
Got his name spelt out on the back!

1036
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:26,076
The clothes, right?!
- All slick and shiny!

1037
01:21:26,211 --> 01:21:28,055
Flash them gold teeth at them gals!

1038
01:21:28,290 --> 01:21:29,859
Got his sax man behind him.

1039
01:21:30,494 --> 01:21:33,358
Maybe a piano, harmonica and drums.

1040
01:21:33,493 --> 01:21:36,092
Hey, you remember that night
at the Esquire Club,

1041
01:21:36,127 --> 01:21:38,188
when the lights went out in Mobile?

1042
01:21:38,223 --> 01:21:40,214
Yeah, and they took off with the gate.

1043
01:21:40,749 --> 01:21:43,278
Just stole the damn register
right off the counter!

1044
01:21:43,583 --> 01:21:45,547
They didn't hold Reggie Porter
for it, did they?!

1045
01:21:45,682 --> 01:21:47,736
Nah! They knew it was
his place got robbed!

1046
01:21:48,141 --> 01:21:51,729
Did nobody hold it to Reggie Porter?

1047
01:21:51,864 --> 01:21:55,223
And nobody expected
their money to come back.

1048
01:21:55,558 --> 01:21:58,182
No, cos they was too busy
diving for the pot

1049
01:21:58,217 --> 01:21:59,966
in that tonk game got interrupted.

1050
01:22:00,201 --> 01:22:04,259
And nobody suspected that it might
have been Reggie Porter hisself!

1051
01:22:04,294 --> 01:22:07,418
Hisself that pulled the lights!

1052
01:22:11,117 --> 01:22:12,441
No.

1053
01:22:12,476 --> 01:22:13,675
No, Ty. No.

1054
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:14,839
No. No. No.

1055
01:22:14,874 --> 01:22:19,432
China Doll! You mind the place till
we get back. Hey, come on, Mace.

1056
01:22:19,567 --> 01:22:20,957
Where you going, Daddy?!

1057
01:22:21,192 --> 01:22:25,090
I promised the people Guitar Sam,
and they're going to get Guitar Sam!

1058
01:22:25,145 --> 01:22:26,709
Come on, Mace, let's get out of here!

1059
01:22:26,824 --> 01:22:28,009
We got work to do.

1060
01:22:34,946 --> 01:22:37,045
Why are you so interested in this boy?

1061
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:39,464
Got a job for him.

1062
01:22:41,064 --> 01:22:44,502
You must be doing pretty well
for yourself out there, Tyrone.

1063
01:22:44,537 --> 01:22:46,501
You're hiring new people on.

1064
01:22:46,536 --> 01:22:49,345
Passing well, yeah.

1065
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:52,298
But this boy...
- Name is Sonny.

1066
01:22:52,333 --> 01:22:54,302
Uh-huh.

1067
01:22:54,837 --> 01:22:57,536
Well, he's paying off his debt
to society right now.

1068
01:22:57,971 --> 01:23:00,060
If I was to pull him out of the field...

1069
01:23:00,195 --> 01:23:03,493
Judge Gatlin pays 3 a day
for prison labour.

1070
01:23:04,833 --> 01:23:08,091
You willing to pay 4
for the duration of his sentence?

1071
01:23:08,426 --> 01:23:11,470
Which might be?
- As long as I care to make it.

1072
01:23:14,749 --> 01:23:17,008
Well, I was counting on...

1073
01:23:17,643 --> 01:23:20,094
more of a one-time deal.

1074
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:23,645
If I can rent him out just for the weekend
- 50 dollars.

1075
01:23:26,704 --> 01:23:27,818
It's not just the money.

1076
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:32,511
There's legalistic principles
involved here. Public safety issues.

1077
01:23:33,566 --> 01:23:34,995
I'll pay you Sunday morning.

1078
01:23:35,190 --> 01:23:37,808
You going to pay me now,
or you can forget about it.

1079
01:23:39,998 --> 01:23:41,287
I don't have it now.

1080
01:23:41,422 --> 01:23:43,126
Hm.

1081
01:23:45,086 --> 01:23:48,244
You think you're too smart for
the rest of us, don't you, Tyrone?

1082
01:23:49,179 --> 01:23:51,703
Think you can go it all by yourself.

1083
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:56,406
You'd rather eat roofin' nails

1084
01:23:56,441 --> 01:23:59,010
than come to me for a favour now,
wouldn't you?

1085
01:23:59,295 --> 01:24:01,679
It's not a favour if I gotta pay for it.

1086
01:24:02,314 --> 01:24:04,157
Oh, you're gonna pay all right.

1087
01:24:05,276 --> 01:24:08,595
If you don't hand over that money
to me by Sunday morning,

1088
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:10,994
you got yourself a new partner.

1089
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:18,851
Same deal as I got with Toussaint.

1090
01:24:18,886 --> 01:24:20,330
What'll that be?

1091
01:24:24,869 --> 01:24:25,998
You'll get the 50.

1092
01:24:27,828 --> 01:24:29,407
And that wife of yours.

1093
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:32,925
Delilah?
- Mm-hm.

1094
01:24:34,525 --> 01:24:36,609
Them fried chicken sandwiches.

1095
01:24:37,044 --> 01:24:41,881
If I was to come by now and then
and check in on my interests?

1096
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,284
She be happy to fix you whatever you want.

1097
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:50,477
Good. Cos my wife's cooking
would gag a maggot.

1098
01:24:51,612 --> 01:24:55,560
Different people got different talents.
- Yeah.

1099
01:24:56,295 --> 01:24:58,434
Well Lurleen ain't discovered
what hers is yet.

1100
01:24:59,069 --> 01:25:00,093
Let's go fetch that boy.

1101
01:25:16,946 --> 01:25:19,225
Is this the one you want?
- Mm.

1102
01:25:22,063 --> 01:25:25,682
You got any ideas about running
rabbit on me, best get rid of them now.

1103
01:25:26,017 --> 01:25:28,721
You paying my way out?
- Till Monday.

1104
01:25:28,956 --> 01:25:30,325
How come?

1105
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:32,799
You like dragging that cotton sack?

1106
01:25:33,434 --> 01:25:36,337
No.
- Then don't ask questions.

1107
01:25:55,789 --> 01:25:59,272
♫ Why don't you do right

1108
01:25:59,307 --> 01:26:02,706
♫ Like some other men do... ♫

1109
01:26:03,341 --> 01:26:04,630
This size, right...

1110
01:26:05,915 --> 01:26:07,919
but it's got to shine.

1111
01:26:07,954 --> 01:26:10,398
And when you need this?
- Tonight.

1112
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:14,116
That's a tall order.
- It's got to happen.

1113
01:26:14,551 --> 01:26:20,868
You know, I do my best work,
my fastest work,

1114
01:26:21,503 --> 01:26:23,353
when I'm happy.

1115
01:26:25,238 --> 01:26:28,596
Yeah, I suppose you do.

1116
01:26:30,774 --> 01:26:33,073
You gonna make me happy, baby?

1117
01:26:33,708 --> 01:26:35,632
Uh...

1118
01:26:36,812 --> 01:26:39,775
You come down by the club tonight.

1119
01:26:40,110 --> 01:26:44,088
We having a special show.
Tell 'em at the door, you my guest.

1120
01:26:44,323 --> 01:26:48,467
Food ain't the only thing a
woman needs three times a day.

1121
01:26:48,823 --> 01:26:50,967
[ Mutters ] Wouldn't hurt
you to skip a few meals.

1122
01:26:51,585 --> 01:26:53,110
What's that, baby?

1123
01:26:53,145 --> 01:26:58,442
Um, that boy gonna need time, try
this jacket on, see how he feels.

1124
01:26:59,177 --> 01:27:00,702
Later, Nadine.

1125
01:27:19,593 --> 01:27:21,977
You got to do something
to this boy's hair, darling.

1126
01:27:22,912 --> 01:27:26,370
They may not know what the real Sam
looked like, but it ain't this.

1127
01:27:26,505 --> 01:27:28,014
I can try.

1128
01:27:28,749 --> 01:27:30,404
What exactly am I supposed to do?

1129
01:27:30,569 --> 01:27:33,227
You're gonna stand up there
with that contraption you got,

1130
01:27:33,262 --> 01:27:35,324
and play Guitar Sam's numbers.

1131
01:27:36,059 --> 01:27:37,651
I can do that with my eyes closed.

1132
01:27:37,706 --> 01:27:40,544
If we can get the audience to
close theirs, we'll be better off.

1133
01:27:41,079 --> 01:27:43,302
- Ty! I tracked Mr Trenier down.

1134
01:27:45,022 --> 01:27:46,001
Let's hit it.

1135
01:27:48,236 --> 01:27:49,080
Bye, Daddy.

1136
01:28:05,994 --> 01:28:07,512
You know what you're doing?

1137
01:28:08,947 --> 01:28:10,996
I fix Mama's hair all the time.

1138
01:28:12,531 --> 01:28:14,451
But you ain't been to that school yet.

1139
01:28:15,465 --> 01:28:17,829
You go to school to learn your guitar?

1140
01:28:19,948 --> 01:28:20,692
No.

1141
01:28:21,467 --> 01:28:23,505
I might pick up
some things at beauty school,

1142
01:28:23,550 --> 01:28:25,381
but mostly it's for my certificate.

1143
01:28:25,616 --> 01:28:28,519
"And that is a ticket to adventure."

1144
01:28:28,654 --> 01:28:30,788
That's what it says in the brochure.

1145
01:28:30,823 --> 01:28:33,007
People looking for beauty
all over the world.

1146
01:28:34,482 --> 01:28:36,620
You ought to watch out for
them wires sticking down.

1147
01:28:36,655 --> 01:28:37,745
That don't look safe.

1148
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:39,939
Yeah, power's always going out.

1149
01:28:39,974 --> 01:28:42,098
People getting shocks and whatnot.

1150
01:28:42,233 --> 01:28:44,182
Somebody ought to fix it.

1151
01:28:44,917 --> 01:28:48,575
"Career and beauty
is like money in the bank."

1152
01:28:49,110 --> 01:28:50,751
Says that in the brochure too.

1153
01:28:51,486 --> 01:28:53,558
Plus it isn't physically taxin'.

1154
01:28:53,893 --> 01:28:57,511
Yeah, can't see no pretty thing
like you behind a plough.

1155
01:29:01,909 --> 01:29:04,358
I had the rheumatic fever
when I was little.

1156
01:29:04,663 --> 01:29:06,427
It left me with a weak heart.

1157
01:29:07,562 --> 01:29:08,451
Oh.

1158
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:11,685
Mine been acting kind of funny too.

1159
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:14,684
About since I laid eyes on you.

1160
01:29:20,202 --> 01:29:23,920
What's that?
- Just some old moonshine they keep around.

1161
01:29:25,615 --> 01:29:28,099
What are you gonna do with it?

1162
01:29:28,198 --> 01:29:31,407
They joke about how this stuff
will straighten your hair right out.

1163
01:29:33,596 --> 01:29:35,834
I'll just make yours relax a little.

1164
01:29:51,348 --> 01:29:53,192
Mr Time Trenier.

1165
01:29:54,727 --> 01:29:56,591
Has a name to be reckoned with.

1166
01:29:57,526 --> 01:30:00,204
The story goes you used
to play with Buddy Bolan.

1167
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:02,209
- I played with them all down there.

1168
01:30:02,244 --> 01:30:03,432
And King Oliver.

1169
01:30:03,644 --> 01:30:06,802
One band falls apart,
you find yourself another.

1170
01:30:06,997 --> 01:30:10,279
There's never a shortage in bands
down in New Orleans.

1171
01:30:11,114 --> 01:30:12,798
I didn't know you were giving lessons.

1172
01:30:12,833 --> 01:30:14,997
It pays the rent, almost.

1173
01:30:16,197 --> 01:30:18,141
You interested in a playing job?

1174
01:30:18,676 --> 01:30:22,075
If you can pay, I can play.
- You got to dress sharp.

1175
01:30:24,114 --> 01:30:25,838
It ain't like an all-night thing.

1176
01:30:25,873 --> 01:30:30,831
You just got to start out, and
then there's gonna be an accident.

1177
01:30:30,866 --> 01:30:31,955
An accident?

1178
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:35,389
Yeah, a sudden loss of power.

1179
01:30:35,524 --> 01:30:36,749
Lights out.

1180
01:30:38,128 --> 01:30:39,728
It's your gig, man.

1181
01:30:40,163 --> 01:30:41,772
8 o'clock.

1182
01:30:41,807 --> 01:30:44,126
This ain't no coloured people's time.

1183
01:30:44,161 --> 01:30:45,722
And sure ain't New Orleans time.

1184
01:30:46,057 --> 01:30:48,148
I mean, 8 o'clock on the money.

1185
01:30:48,883 --> 01:30:51,242
If you got the green, I'm on the scene.

1186
01:30:51,277 --> 01:30:52,998
Then that's a deal.

1187
01:30:53,033 --> 01:30:54,685
You know any drummers?

1188
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:58,279
I bring you one.
- And nothing fancy.

1189
01:30:58,314 --> 01:31:00,358
Just as long as he keep time.

1190
01:31:01,203 --> 01:31:03,037
Time is my name.

1191
01:31:12,313 --> 01:31:17,411
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.

1192
01:31:18,296 --> 01:31:20,160
Make your mark here, please.

1193
01:31:21,195 --> 01:31:22,359
You owe me 30.

1194
01:31:24,698 --> 01:31:26,082
The book says 28.

1195
01:31:26,997 --> 01:31:30,755
1.50 every 100lb, and I picked...

1196
01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:33,009
2 deducted for stones.

1197
01:31:33,934 --> 01:31:36,258
But there was no stones in the sack.

1198
01:31:37,293 --> 01:31:40,011
We mill the cotton, son.
There's always stones.

1199
01:31:40,346 --> 01:31:42,850
But there weren't none in my sack.

1200
01:31:46,149 --> 01:31:50,227
We take off 2 a week for stones.
That's the way it's always been.

1201
01:31:52,686 --> 01:31:54,310
Ain't that right, Junebug?

1202
01:31:55,005 --> 01:31:57,944
Yes, sir.
Been that way my whole life.

1203
01:31:59,463 --> 01:32:02,921
You gonna take your pay, son,
or you gonna give it up to charity?

1204
01:32:20,624 --> 01:32:22,423
Wouldn't let nobody mess
with my money like that.

1205
01:32:22,458 --> 01:32:24,307
He took the same 2 off yours.

1206
01:32:24,342 --> 01:32:27,661
Yeah, but you could pave a highway
with the rocks I threw in that mess.

1207
01:32:28,096 --> 01:32:30,997
You country nigros
let the crackers run you like dogs.

1208
01:32:31,732 --> 01:32:34,398
If the sheriff wasn't here
I'd snap your neck, boy.

1209
01:32:34,633 --> 01:32:35,861
Don't let me stop you.

1210
01:32:38,116 --> 01:32:41,314
But first, you're gonna sign
that ledger like you're s'pose to.

1211
01:32:42,149 --> 01:32:44,943
Don't want nobody crying
they didn't get their due.

1212
01:32:55,029 --> 01:32:57,868
[ DELILAH HUMS ]

1213
01:33:18,139 --> 01:33:20,417
How could you do that?
- I'm gonna put it back.

1214
01:33:20,852 --> 01:33:23,496
You don't go gambling with my baby's money.

1215
01:33:23,931 --> 01:33:27,080
If I don't pay him,
the man don't come, ain't playing.

1216
01:33:27,515 --> 01:33:29,314
I don't care what you took it for.

1217
01:33:29,409 --> 01:33:31,199
I save for China Doll

1218
01:33:31,244 --> 01:33:33,872
and you ain't got not business
putting your fingers on it.

1219
01:33:33,997 --> 01:33:35,477
China don't need any school, baby.

1220
01:33:35,512 --> 01:33:38,271
She could walk into any of those
places right now and get a job.

1221
01:33:38,306 --> 01:33:41,509
There's got to be some line
you won't cross, Ty.

1222
01:33:41,544 --> 01:33:43,746
There's got to be something you won't do.

1223
01:33:43,881 --> 01:33:45,113
The world start throwing me a break woman,

1224
01:33:45,148 --> 01:33:47,612
maybe I'll catch religion
and walk the straight and narrow

1225
01:33:47,647 --> 01:33:50,944
like those Bible thumpers you
sit up with. But until that day...

1226
01:33:51,179 --> 01:33:53,923
Reverend Cutlip was right about you.

1227
01:33:58,222 --> 01:33:59,661
Horseshit!!!

1228
01:33:59,896 --> 01:34:01,501
Damn!

1229
01:34:34,866 --> 01:34:35,905
Mr Purvis?

1230
01:34:37,925 --> 01:34:43,043
People call me Ty or they call me
Pine Top, it's Mr Pine Top to you.

1231
01:34:46,461 --> 01:34:49,500
I just want to tell you how
I appreciate the opportunity.

1232
01:34:49,535 --> 01:34:51,019
Right.

1233
01:34:56,017 --> 01:34:58,996
I know every one of Guitar Sam's songs.

1234
01:34:59,031 --> 01:35:01,975
I know the chords, I know the words.

1235
01:35:06,212 --> 01:35:09,091
China Doll was saying
how you was famous once.

1236
01:35:10,910 --> 01:35:12,534
I was known,

1237
01:35:12,969 --> 01:35:14,649
but never what you call famous.

1238
01:35:18,777 --> 01:35:20,456
How do you get your start?

1239
01:35:24,255 --> 01:35:25,699
Down in Mobile.

1240
01:35:26,334 --> 01:35:30,002
An old cathouse professor,

1241
01:35:30,727 --> 01:35:33,516
the name of Joe Dudlow.

1242
01:35:34,251 --> 01:35:36,650
He'd had a stroke on one side.

1243
01:35:37,849 --> 01:35:40,207
Curled him all up.

1244
01:35:41,727 --> 01:35:43,366
Kept on plugging.

1245
01:35:46,455 --> 01:35:51,043
I used to come out and
play his left hand for him.

1246
01:35:51,978 --> 01:35:53,507
This one night,

1247
01:35:53,582 --> 01:35:55,821
he was going hot and heavy.

1248
01:35:58,420 --> 01:36:00,159
Joe just passed,

1249
01:36:00,194 --> 01:36:01,864
right at the piano,

1250
01:36:01,899 --> 01:36:04,278
middle of Black Bottom Stomp.

1251
01:36:06,297 --> 01:36:09,236
They propped him up at the bar,

1252
01:36:09,571 --> 01:36:11,615
stuck a drink in his hand...

1253
01:36:13,174 --> 01:36:18,331
Told me to keep pounding those ivories.

1254
01:36:19,891 --> 01:36:24,249
There was a meanness
hanging over them juke joints.

1255
01:36:24,684 --> 01:36:27,005
There was murder in the air.

1256
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:30,371
Stopped playing for a minute,

1257
01:36:31,406 --> 01:36:34,605
come down on you like a flock of crows.

1258
01:36:34,940 --> 01:36:35,729
- Hey.

1259
01:36:36,564 --> 01:36:37,663
This is you.

1260
01:36:41,342 --> 01:36:43,606
Big band days on the road.

1261
01:36:44,241 --> 01:36:48,579
Reginald Erskine.
I don't believe I've heard of him.

1262
01:36:48,914 --> 01:36:51,997
Big, tall, light skin fella outta Carolina.

1263
01:36:53,107 --> 01:36:55,775
Said he was part Cherokee.

1264
01:36:56,934 --> 01:36:58,719
Couldn't play nothing,

1265
01:36:58,754 --> 01:37:02,732
but he'd wave his little stick
and he had this long greasy hair

1266
01:37:02,767 --> 01:37:05,351
he'd through around like Cab Calloway.

1267
01:37:06,386 --> 01:37:08,055
And you were the piano man?

1268
01:37:08,390 --> 01:37:12,003
Piano man, arranger, you name it.

1269
01:37:12,428 --> 01:37:15,227
That must have been something,
travelling the country first class.

1270
01:37:15,262 --> 01:37:19,725
I don't know about first class,
but I seen the country.

1271
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:22,544
How come you stopped?

1272
01:37:25,703 --> 01:37:29,166
I got tired of carrying
another man's water.

1273
01:37:29,501 --> 01:37:33,779
Didn't want to die in no
coloured hotel some night

1274
01:37:33,814 --> 01:37:35,918
in who knows where Arkansas.

1275
01:37:39,616 --> 01:37:41,060
Met Delilah.

1276
01:37:42,495 --> 01:37:44,294
Wanted something of my own.

1277
01:37:48,893 --> 01:37:51,611
You don't have nothing
to worry about, Mr Pine Top.

1278
01:37:52,246 --> 01:37:54,035
I won't let you down.

1279
01:37:54,570 --> 01:37:58,769
No, I... I don't suppose you will.

1280
01:38:24,837 --> 01:38:26,002

Hi there, young lady.

1310
01:40:23,187 --> 01:40:25,785
Good evening, welcome to the
Honeydripper. Have a good time.

1311
01:40:31,043 --> 01:40:32,646
Native's gettin' restless.

1312
01:40:33,981 --> 01:40:37,060
How we doing?
- We gonna be full up, but the food...

1313
01:40:40,179 --> 01:40:41,598
Is Delilah comin' in?

1314
01:40:43,697 --> 01:40:45,301
What if I lost her?

1315
01:40:45,336 --> 01:40:49,195
She won't let you down, Ty.
- This ain't going to work, is it?

1316
01:40:49,530 --> 01:40:52,658
You just got to play it out and see.
- Guitar Sam!

1317
01:40:52,993 --> 01:40:55,152
See if you can push another round
of drinks while I stall 'em.

1318
01:40:55,487 --> 01:40:56,257
Then you going to bring him out?

1319
01:40:56,292 --> 01:40:59,790
Hey! We come here to hear
the guitar man play!

1320
01:41:00,525 --> 01:41:01,215
Be on the wires.

1321
01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:05,313
Give them three bars, then you pull it.
- Guitar Sam!

1322
01:41:05,388 --> 01:41:08,867
Look, I got a baseball bat under the
counter but you out here all alone.

1323
01:41:09,502 --> 01:41:11,190
Just get the liquor moving, Mace.

1324
01:41:11,425 --> 01:41:13,504
And keep the money
where you can run with it.

1325
01:41:14,239 --> 01:41:14,848
Guitar Sam!

1326
01:41:15,883 --> 01:41:20,661
The Lord don't want nobody
to sit back and suffer.

1327
01:41:21,196 --> 01:41:23,397
He want you to stand up.

1328
01:41:23,732 --> 01:41:26,205
He want you to rise up.

1329
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:29,143
He want you to step forward

1330
01:41:29,578 --> 01:41:34,915
and come down to the merciful arms
of his eternal salvation.

1331
01:41:35,450 --> 01:41:40,003
A fire is heating up, brothers and sisters,

1332
01:41:40,328 --> 01:41:42,497
and judgement day is nigh.

1333
01:41:42,932 --> 01:41:46,735
Anybody out there tonight
want to answer his call?

1334
01:41:47,070 --> 01:41:52,207
Anybody out there tonight, is gonna
step forward and be saved?

1335
01:41:52,542 --> 01:41:55,251
Ain't no time to hesitate.

1336
01:41:55,286 --> 01:41:58,485
Got to come on down
and offer yourself to the Lord.

1337
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:01,049
Come on. Come on, come on, sister.

1338
01:42:02,384 --> 01:42:05,582
I believe you hear the
Lord's voice talking to you sister.

1339
01:42:05,617 --> 01:42:08,401
That's the Lord's voice
and I believe you hear it.

1340
01:42:09,136 --> 01:42:10,325
I do believe you hear it.

1341
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:14,458
Come on down.
Bring it on down to his salvation.

1342
01:42:14,893 --> 01:42:17,062
Feel the Lord at your back.

1343
01:42:17,097 --> 01:42:21,935
You got to leave them sinners behind.
Come on down.

1344
01:42:23,494 --> 01:42:25,938
Come on down.

1345
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:28,097
I see you sister, coming.

1346
01:42:28,132 --> 01:42:30,571
I see the Lord is talking to you.

1347
01:42:30,606 --> 01:42:33,467
I hear the Lord is talking to you.

1348
01:42:33,902 --> 01:42:36,494
I believe you hear him, sister.

1349
01:42:36,829 --> 01:42:41,307
Come on down,
you hear the voice of the Lord?

1350
01:42:41,342 --> 01:42:43,523
You hear the voice of the Lord.

1351
01:42:43,558 --> 01:42:45,670
That voice is trying to tell you

1352
01:42:45,705 --> 01:42:48,543
where you need to be right now, sister.

1353
01:42:48,578 --> 01:42:51,382
All you've got to do, all you've got to do

1354
01:42:51,417 --> 01:42:54,238
is move your feet and get there.

1355
01:42:54,273 --> 01:42:57,060
Move your feet and get there.

1356
01:43:02,038 --> 01:43:03,437
You look good.

1357
01:43:04,672 --> 01:43:06,076
Damn.

1358
01:43:07,475 --> 01:43:09,519
He look good, don't he, Daddy?
- Yeah.

1359
01:43:10,354 --> 01:43:14,372
Honey, I need you to get right
by that front door

1360
01:43:14,707 --> 01:43:16,808
and take over collecting the cover charge.

1361
01:43:17,003 --> 01:43:19,005
Anything happens, go wrong or something,

1362
01:43:19,430 --> 01:43:22,149
you just step out and walk away
from the club, you hear?

1363
01:43:22,384 --> 01:43:23,788
What's gonna go wrong?

1364
01:43:26,368 --> 01:43:29,346
Guitar Sam here,
gets them soldier boys jumping,

1365
01:43:29,681 --> 01:43:31,001
gets a little rough in here.

1366
01:43:31,286 --> 01:43:33,125
Just stay on your toes, that's all.

1367
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:34,484
OK.

1368
01:43:37,642 --> 01:43:39,121
China Doll?

1369
01:43:40,641 --> 01:43:44,159
You know there ain't a thing in
this world I wouldn't do for you?

1370
01:43:44,694 --> 01:43:46,878
Even if I mess up sometimes.

1371
01:43:47,213 --> 01:43:48,954
You know that, right?
