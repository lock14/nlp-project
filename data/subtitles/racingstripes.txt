1
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:48,979
We gotta jack it up. We need help here.

2
00:00:49,145 --> 00:00:52,662
Hey, we got a flat tire in the back now.
They gotta get that unloaded.

3
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,801
Slim, get over there.
I don't need you working on the tarp.

4
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,454
I got it, I got it! Pull it down.
Hook it at the bottom.

5
00:00:59,621 --> 00:01:01,860
Just get out of the way. Come on.

6
00:01:02,025 --> 00:01:06,732
Hey, guys, get out of the truck.
We need a hand out here. Hurry up.

7
00:01:07,407 --> 00:01:09,646
Come on, they got a flat tire down there.

8
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,641
Let's go, let's go. We gotta get down there.
The animals are getting spooked.

9
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:18,035
Hurry up. Hurry, now.
We've gotta get it unloaded.

10
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:20,475
Don't worry about it. Just let it go.

11
00:01:21,216 --> 00:01:24,481
No, no. No, five of them. Go.
Don't worry about that.

12
00:01:25,476 --> 00:01:28,740
Don't let the zebras run. Stay with them.

13
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,441
- Both of you, come here.
- Everything's off.

14
00:01:33,613 --> 00:01:36,912
- No, no, no.
- All right, it's good. It's good.

15
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:39,625
We'll load them up
as soon as the tire's on.

16
00:01:39,796 --> 00:01:42,165
Load them back on!
Don't forget anything!

17
00:01:42,326 --> 00:01:44,817
- Come on. There you go.
- Go. Go.

18
00:01:44,986 --> 00:01:47,160
- Let's go.
- We've got it.

19
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:49,815
- We got everything?
- We've got it all.

20
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:04,017
What the...? Hey. Hey, there.

21
00:03:11,581 --> 00:03:15,711
Hey, boy, just calm down.
It's all right. It's all right.

22
00:03:19,463 --> 00:03:22,368
There we go. There you go.

23
00:03:58,644 --> 00:04:00,621
It's all right.

24
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,216
It's all right. There you go.

25
00:04:04,635 --> 00:04:07,573
- All right.
- You weren't kidding.

26
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:12,955
Can we keep him, Daddy?
Can we, please?

27
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:16,550
I don't know, it's...

28
00:04:16,712 --> 00:04:20,710
You know, he's probably got all kinds
of special needs. We should...

29
00:04:20,878 --> 00:04:23,664
- We should probably call the zoo and...
- No.

30
00:04:23,825 --> 00:04:27,058
No zoos. You know I don't like the idea
of animals in cages.

31
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:30,071
Honey, neither do I,
but let's just see what we got here.

32
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:32,537
Let's... I gotta think about this.

33
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:40,894
Well, first things first. Let's get him
some blankets and warm milk.

34
00:04:41,188 --> 00:04:44,291
Okay, don't get too carried away.

35
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:05,596
- Stop waking me up.
- What's in the basket?

36
00:05:05,762 --> 00:05:08,220
Hey, Tucker. Did you see that?

37
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:11,141
You seen one funny-Iooking horse,
you seen them all.

38
00:05:11,305 --> 00:05:14,623
Oh, come on.
Get out there and say hello.

39
00:05:14,796 --> 00:05:18,215
- Wake me up when he leaves.
- You know what, I'll do it myself.

40
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,874
That's the weirdest-Iooking horse
I've ever seen.

41
00:05:21,043 --> 00:05:24,790
Oh, he's cute. Tucker, come out here
and meet our guest.

42
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:28,118
I'm coming. I swear, Franny,
the funnier-Iooking the animal...

43
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:31,735
...the more you wanna keep it.
- Kept you, didn't I?

44
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,229
Well, subdivide me and Kentucky-fry me.

45
00:05:35,396 --> 00:05:37,635
You know what, Tucker,
you cut those bangs...

46
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:41,447
...you and him could be cousins.
- Bad hair.

47
00:05:41,611 --> 00:05:45,510
- Just thinking out loud. Thinking out loud.
- Question time.

48
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,623
- What exactly are you?
- Good question.

49
00:05:47,795 --> 00:05:51,410
- I don't know.
- Okay, we can rule out genius.

50
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,706
Don't make me chew open a can
of pony whup.

51
00:05:54,874 --> 00:05:56,950
Save the sweet talk for later.

52
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:01,114
Don't pay any attention to him.
Listen, he's all whinny and no bite.

53
00:06:01,282 --> 00:06:04,734
I'm Franny, this is Reggie,
and Mr. Sensitive here is Tucker.

54
00:06:04,901 --> 00:06:07,272
And that old goat there is an old goat.

55
00:06:07,432 --> 00:06:09,344
It's the Chief.

56
00:06:10,764 --> 00:06:13,768
- You used to be so nice.
- Yeah, I know, but I got over it.

57
00:06:13,936 --> 00:06:16,078
Why do you have to be
such a horse's...?

58
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:29,724
Well, let's just get you dried off first,
all right?

59
00:06:36,777 --> 00:06:39,171
He's got real strong legs.

60
00:06:39,343 --> 00:06:41,581
He's quite the little athlete.

61
00:06:45,524 --> 00:06:47,216
Hey, buddy.

62
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:50,842
Why don't you grab the milk
and see if he'll come to you.

63
00:06:52,702 --> 00:06:55,192
Come here, boy. Come on.

64
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,779
Come on. Come on. There you are.

65
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:03,073
Come on, boy.

66
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,835
Come on.

67
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:07,912
Attaboy.

68
00:07:08,686 --> 00:07:11,823
- Welcome to your new home, Stripes.
- Stripes?

69
00:07:12,274 --> 00:07:14,798
Well, "Spot" doesn't work, now, does it?

70
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,417
You like that name, don't you?

71
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:20,313
Stripes.

72
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,633
Well, I'll take that as a yes.

73
00:07:31,946 --> 00:07:34,502
Good morning, Walsh Farm!

74
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,258
Well, I know it's not glamorous,
but it's a living.

75
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:41,553
Keeps my head on my shoulders, which
is more than I can say for my cousins.

76
00:07:44,345 --> 00:07:46,552
Simmer down there, Lightning.

77
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,614
Hey, hey, slow down. Boy, oh, boy.

78
00:08:04,783 --> 00:08:07,537
Kids these days, no control.
Now, back in my day...

79
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:11,086
Oh, here we go again with
the ancient-history lesson. Enough.

80
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:16,851
Now we're in for it.

81
00:08:21,796 --> 00:08:24,450
<i>And the horses are entering</i>
<i>the starting gates.</i>

82
00:08:24,614 --> 00:08:26,210
Oh, what is that?

83
00:08:26,378 --> 00:08:28,802
That is the only reason
for a horse to live, kid.

84
00:08:28,972 --> 00:08:30,183
It's called a racetrack.

85
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:33,549
Oh, there's more to life
than running around in a circle.

86
00:08:33,715 --> 00:08:37,428
Well, maybe to you. It's like this:
Humans race, horses race.

87
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:41,904
There was even a <i>Chicken Run</i>, but there's
never been a goat race. Ever, ever, ever.

88
00:08:42,075 --> 00:08:43,418
Get the picture, Franny?

89
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,438
- Could I race?
- It's complicated.

90
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,871
It takes a lot of work
to become a racehorse.

91
00:08:48,034 --> 00:08:51,070
- What's a racehorse?
- They're the greatest.

92
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,209
Once a year, there's a big race
to see who's the best.

93
00:08:54,378 --> 00:08:57,829
By the way, the horses that won every year
were the ones we trained.

94
00:08:57,997 --> 00:09:01,197
- Why did you quit?
- lxnay on the other-may.

95
00:09:01,362 --> 00:09:04,562
Say what you mean.
We haven't spoken Latin since the pigs left.

96
00:09:04,725 --> 00:09:05,905
Oh, all right.

97
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:08,791
A few years ago, the girl's mother
had an accident.

98
00:09:08,955 --> 00:09:12,155
Yeah. Her horse stumbled
and neither one of them could be saved.

99
00:09:12,317 --> 00:09:15,769
- The Chief couldn't bear to train after that.
- And neither did we.

100
00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:18,559
Hey, look, they're ready to go.

101
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,960
- How come none of them have stripes?
- You take this one.

102
00:09:22,122 --> 00:09:23,465
Thanks.

103
00:09:24,107 --> 00:09:26,445
Just unlucky, I guess.

104
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,515
<i>And they're off. Flash of Thunder's...</i>

105
00:09:29,683 --> 00:09:33,844
Look at them. Look at them run.
Watch me, I'm a racehorse.

106
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:38,519
Well, would you look at him?
He loves to run. It's in his heart.

107
00:09:38,684 --> 00:09:40,989
- But that's not enough.
- You could train him.

108
00:09:41,152 --> 00:09:43,804
- Then it would be enough.
- Let me tell you something.

109
00:09:43,971 --> 00:09:48,253
The legs are too short, the head's too big.
He's got as much chance to race as me.

110
00:09:48,424 --> 00:09:52,138
Besides, I have got better things to do.

111
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,303
- Oh, go fix your hair.
- I heard that.

112
00:09:55,472 --> 00:09:57,743
Watch me, I'm in the big race.

113
00:09:58,292 --> 00:10:01,295
Excuse me. Racehorse coming through.

114
00:10:08,512 --> 00:10:10,074
Whoa, look at that.

115
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,594
- Come on.
- Dude, I'm right with you.

116
00:10:16,553 --> 00:10:19,872
Whoa, nice mohawk.

117
00:10:20,044 --> 00:10:22,535
That's funny. Mohawk.

118
00:10:22,703 --> 00:10:25,325
- What's a mohawk?
- Shut up, you idiot.

119
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:28,658
- You guys train to race?
- Yeah, you want a taste?

120
00:10:28,822 --> 00:10:32,275
- Ready, set, go. Catch me if you can.
- Hey, I wasn't ready.

121
00:10:32,442 --> 00:10:35,446
Come on, you slowpoke! Yeah!

122
00:10:40,676 --> 00:10:45,832
- I'm not even in second gear yet.
- Yeah, he's not even in second gear yet.

123
00:10:50,288 --> 00:10:52,362
Last one to the fence is a donkey.

124
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,085
- Dude, it's your dad.
- Great.

125
00:10:56,373 --> 00:10:59,224
Son. Stay away from that fence.

126
00:10:59,385 --> 00:11:01,592
Come on, Dad.
We were just having some fun.

127
00:11:01,757 --> 00:11:02,936
Fun is overrated.

128
00:11:03,101 --> 00:11:06,902
If you're going to be a champion,
I suggest you start acting like one.

129
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:10,307
- Oh, your dad scares me, dude.
- Not me.

130
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:13,059
- Pride! Ruffshodd!
- Coming, Father.

131
00:11:13,226 --> 00:11:16,076
Yeah, coming, Mr. Sir Trenton, sir.

132
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:23,763
I don't understand.
Why won't he let them play with me?

133
00:11:23,927 --> 00:11:29,847
You're just different.
And for some horses, different is scary.

134
00:11:52,214 --> 00:11:53,678
Come on, he's never late.

135
00:11:54,969 --> 00:11:57,394
I'm all ready to go. Where is he?

136
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,313
Oh, here he comes.

137
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,340
Bring it on. Show me what you got.

138
00:12:07,528 --> 00:12:09,354
Here we go.

139
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,654
Better luck tomorrow!

140
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:19,057
Dang! I had him today.

141
00:13:26,755 --> 00:13:29,573
- She's just not right today, Mr. Cooper.
- Yep.

142
00:13:29,736 --> 00:13:32,389
- Better give her a break.
- Okay.

143
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:36,488
You call that jumping?
Looked like she was having a seizure.

144
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:39,888
Sorry, Miss Dalrymple.
She seemed a bit shy on the high jump...

145
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:43,022
...so I thought I'd take it easy.
- Of course you did.

146
00:13:43,192 --> 00:13:47,025
But, you know, the thing is,
I don't pay you to take it easy.

147
00:13:47,196 --> 00:13:49,140
I pay you to train.

148
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:51,581
You can only push a horse so hard.

149
00:13:52,225 --> 00:13:56,900
Cooper, Cooper, Cooper.
Why must you be so tedious?

150
00:13:58,696 --> 00:14:00,127
Okay, here's the deal.

151
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:05,323
Now, as long as I am signing your checks,
you will push her as hard as I tell you to.

152
00:14:05,488 --> 00:14:08,590
Don't you have a board meeting
at the track to get to?

153
00:14:09,173 --> 00:14:11,345
As a matter of fact, I do.

154
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:17,975
Yo, yo, Pride. Check out the new filly.
What a mane.

155
00:14:18,144 --> 00:14:19,422
Look at those flanks.

156
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:23,331
Watch. She's gonna come straight for me.
Do I have anything in my teeth?

157
00:14:23,493 --> 00:14:26,048
You always have something
in your teeth, Ruffshodd.

158
00:14:26,504 --> 00:14:28,776
- Hey, where's she going?
- Excuse me.

159
00:14:29,131 --> 00:14:33,162
- Would you care to join me for a drink?
- A drink. Good call.

160
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:36,372
No.

161
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:38,573
Talk to the tail, boys.

162
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:43,413
Did you ever consider going around
that tree instead of through it?

163
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,032
Yeah, well, usually it moves
out of my way.

164
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,659
I've never heard of a tree doing that.

165
00:14:49,827 --> 00:14:52,001
You don't know the trees here.
Are you new?

166
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,236
- Just got here. I'm Sandy.
- I'm Stripes.

167
00:14:55,402 --> 00:14:57,477
You don't say?

168
00:14:57,645 --> 00:15:01,392
- Are you a racehorse?
- No, I'm a jumper.

169
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:03,727
I've actually competed
all around the world.

170
00:15:03,892 --> 00:15:07,026
Well, I'm a racehorse.
I'm training to be in the big race.

171
00:15:07,415 --> 00:15:09,010
By racing the mailman?

172
00:15:09,178 --> 00:15:11,352
Well, the other horses
don't wanna race me.

173
00:15:11,516 --> 00:15:14,073
- I'm just way too fast for them.
- He's not a racer.

174
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,486
Oh, not them again.

175
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:19,998
They say his dad's a horse
and his mom's a fence.

176
00:15:20,807 --> 00:15:22,533
Real funny, guys.

177
00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:26,476
I've gotta go, I'm sorry.
I'll see you around, Stripes?

178
00:15:26,638 --> 00:15:29,359
- Later.
- So, Stripey, how's it going?

179
00:15:29,521 --> 00:15:32,842
- You still racing the mailman?
- Oh, the mailman wasn't racing him.

180
00:15:33,013 --> 00:15:37,688
- He was running away from him.
- I'll race you any time you want.

181
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:42,942
- Well, unfortunately I don't race nobodies.
- Yeah, he don't race nobodies.

182
00:15:43,105 --> 00:15:47,715
- Figures. All talk and no action.
- Well, this is disappointing.

183
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,183
- Oh, it's my dad.
- Listen, you.

184
00:15:50,345 --> 00:15:54,026
I want you to stop bothering my son.
And you can tell Tucker I said that.

185
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:58,156
Trenton's Pride is a champion
with a real future. And you, well...

186
00:15:58,322 --> 00:15:59,916
You have your place.

187
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,389
- Father, l...
- You and I will talk later.

188
00:16:02,552 --> 00:16:06,385
Mr. Sir Trenton, sir, we been trying
to get this guy to stop bothering us...

189
00:16:06,556 --> 00:16:08,827
...but he just won't stop...
- Ruffshodd.

190
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,776
...bothering us.
- Shut up, you idiot.

191
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:14,429
Yes, Mr. Sir Trenton, sir.

192
00:16:14,596 --> 00:16:17,699
And may I say,
your coat is very shiny today.

193
00:16:17,865 --> 00:16:21,546
There's a place where we can settle this.
No humans. No rules.

194
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,396
Where and when?

195
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:37,596
- Welcome to the Blue Moon Races.
- Yeah!

196
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:39,354
- It's him.
- Be quiet. Be quiet.

197
00:16:39,522 --> 00:16:44,481
Tonight's first contestant
is 10-0 and good to go.

198
00:16:44,648 --> 00:16:48,426
He is the baddest pony on the prairie.

199
00:16:48,588 --> 00:16:53,810
Give it up for Trenton's Pride.

200
00:16:59,193 --> 00:17:01,235
Step right up, if you're horse enough.

201
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:03,959
- Not me, no way.
- Who's feeling their oats?

202
00:17:04,126 --> 00:17:06,649
- Nobody can beat him.
- No way. He's too tough.

203
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,794
I'll take him on.

204
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:23,566
Laugh it up. Just wait and see.

205
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:28,149
- Hey, Sandy.
- Hi, Stripes.

206
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:31,769
Well, well.
I'm surprised you showed up.

207
00:17:31,935 --> 00:17:34,009
You wanna talk or race?

208
00:17:34,176 --> 00:17:37,956
- That coat is simply dreadful.
- Well, it's slimming, though. Right?

209
00:17:38,117 --> 00:17:42,017
- Oh, you're gonna wish you stayed home.
- You're gonna wish I stayed home too.

210
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,394
After I kick your butt.

211
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,740
And now, let's get ready to...

212
00:17:49,906 --> 00:17:53,359
...race!

213
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:04,988
Up to that heap, around it
and back to here.

214
00:18:07,944 --> 00:18:11,723
I am going to make you look so bad
in front of your girlfriend.

215
00:18:12,334 --> 00:18:14,824
- Send him home, Pride.
- Show him who's boss.

216
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,003
You got guts, kid.

217
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,825
Come on, Pride.
You show him who's in charge.

218
00:18:21,496 --> 00:18:22,675
Let's go!

219
00:18:22,842 --> 00:18:26,194
Come on, Stripey, try and keep up.
See you, loser.

220
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:29,985
Just giving you a head start.
You're gonna need it.

221
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:32,602
Come on, Pride, is that all you got?

222
00:18:32,773 --> 00:18:34,848
I'm not even breaking a sweat yet.

223
00:18:35,016 --> 00:18:37,637
Good thing your daddy's not here
to see this.

224
00:18:37,803 --> 00:18:40,106
Holy cow, what a kick.

225
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,904
- At least you're gonna keep this interesting.
- I told you guys he's fast.

226
00:18:50,425 --> 00:18:53,496
Slow down, kid,
you're gonna blow the turn.

227
00:18:57,633 --> 00:18:59,261
Stripes!

228
00:19:00,163 --> 00:19:03,943
Nice turn, Stripey.
I tried to warn you.

229
00:19:08,878 --> 00:19:11,336
How's that ridge taste?

230
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,184
What can you say? Rookie mistake.

231
00:19:19,354 --> 00:19:22,325
- Stripes, are you all right?
- Go back where you belong!

232
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,279
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- What a loser!

233
00:19:25,442 --> 00:19:27,200
Get out of here!

234
00:19:28,997 --> 00:19:30,975
- Stripes.
- We don't want you.

235
00:19:31,689 --> 00:19:34,593
- Go home!
- Hey, Stripey.

236
00:19:34,764 --> 00:19:38,860
Did you really think that you could beat
a trained professional?

237
00:20:02,444 --> 00:20:04,814
Hey there, boy.

238
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,331
What's up? What's the matter?

239
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:12,178
Feel like there's something
you're not telling me.

240
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,484
What, you sick or something?

241
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:19,196
There you are.
Now you're all gorgeous again.

242
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,107
I can't have my best boy
looking all gnarly, now, can I?

243
00:20:25,222 --> 00:20:27,331
Stay out of the mud.

244
00:20:27,497 --> 00:20:29,834
So you don't know
where the mud came from?

245
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:34,857
- It didn't come from the Blue Moon Races?
- Nope, just took a mudbath for my arthritis.

246
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:40,013
Chan!

247
00:20:41,753 --> 00:20:43,763
Helmet.

248
00:20:46,848 --> 00:20:49,305
- Take it easy.
- I'm gonna be late for work.

249
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:51,452
Yeah, that's right.

250
00:21:02,897 --> 00:21:05,072
Boy, will you get a load of this dump?

251
00:21:05,236 --> 00:21:08,589
Even Old MacDonald wouldn't want
this farm, but it's perfect.

252
00:21:08,761 --> 00:21:12,889
Miles from the Jersey shore,
not an ocean in sight, not even a birdbath.

253
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:16,287
No one will look for a classy guy
like the Goose here.

254
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:21,543
Watch where you're going,
that's my knee.

255
00:21:22,537 --> 00:21:24,547
So that's how we land
in the big city.

256
00:21:24,715 --> 00:21:27,468
If there's no parking space,
you make one.

257
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:29,771
Any of you mugs got a problem
with that?

258
00:21:29,937 --> 00:21:32,013
Nice landing.
Can we see you take off now?

259
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,419
Are you a small horse
or some sort of an ass?

260
00:21:34,582 --> 00:21:37,782
- Because you look like an ass to me.
- I don't mean to be rude...

261
00:21:37,947 --> 00:21:41,463
...but you seem to be more surf than turf.
Did you take a wrong turn?

262
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,863
Because you look slow, I'll skip the salad
and get to the risotto.

263
00:21:45,026 --> 00:21:48,194
Let's just say I'm having
a little disagreement with my family.

264
00:21:48,358 --> 00:21:51,907
We disagree on whether or not
they should whack me. Name's Goose.

265
00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:54,599
Oh, a pelican named Goose.
Well, my name's Duck.

266
00:21:54,765 --> 00:21:56,655
- Duck? Duck?
- Duck. Goose.

267
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,155
Oh, you're funny.

268
00:21:58,321 --> 00:22:02,100
But there's only room for one wise guy
on this farm, and you should know...

269
00:22:02,261 --> 00:22:06,128
...Goose is a name that strikes fear
into anyone on the East Coast.

270
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,567
Don't shoot! I didn't do it!

271
00:22:08,734 --> 00:22:11,705
It was the horse with the funny hair.
The goat's in on it.

272
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:14,462
You're fine unless you're being chased
by a tractor.

273
00:22:14,629 --> 00:22:16,605
Look, here's the whole spaghetti sauce.

274
00:22:16,775 --> 00:22:20,162
I'm a hit bird, and when Sammy the Gull
needs a lesson taught...

275
00:22:20,331 --> 00:22:21,991
...the Goose is the guy he calls.

276
00:22:22,158 --> 00:22:25,007
Only this last job, I had a little mishap.

277
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:30,161
Instead of hitting Freddy the Flamingo,
I hit Sammy's capo, Johnny Storkanado.

278
00:22:30,327 --> 00:22:33,199
And now Sammy, Freddy, Johnny,
they're all after me.

279
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:36,921
- Hey, ever try shutting up?
- Ever try swimming in cement horseshoes?

280
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:40,571
- I've taken out punks bigger than you.
- What, you talk them to death?

281
00:22:40,738 --> 00:22:44,769
Careful, pony boy, or somebody's gonna
wake up with your head in their bed.

282
00:22:44,935 --> 00:22:47,174
Knew from that pecker
you'd be a bigmouth.

283
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:48,550
Watch it, stumpy.

284
00:22:48,716 --> 00:22:52,616
I'd cut you off at the knees, but it looks
like somebody's beaten me to it.

285
00:22:52,785 --> 00:22:55,888
All right, knock it off.
Nobody has anything to prove here.

286
00:22:56,053 --> 00:22:58,193
Proof? You want proof, huh?

287
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,429
You see Rusty the Rotating Rooster
up there?

288
00:23:01,596 --> 00:23:05,856
- He's about to get Goosed.
- Where is hunting season when you need it?

289
00:23:07,425 --> 00:23:10,561
Okay, adjust for the wind.
Nice, level flight.

290
00:23:10,949 --> 00:23:13,823
Come on, Goose, use the Force.

291
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:26,066
Well, you can't say that he couldn't
hit the broadside of a barn door.

292
00:23:26,232 --> 00:23:30,514
Acid rain! Acid rain! I'm blind.
It's too late for me.

293
00:23:30,684 --> 00:23:35,807
Save yourselves. I'm going to the light.
I see a bucket of dead relatives!

294
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:40,318
Extra crispy. Extra crispy!

295
00:23:48,786 --> 00:23:51,342
That's the worst turn
I've ever seen anybody make.

296
00:23:51,509 --> 00:23:54,993
- Awful, terrible, stink-o.
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

297
00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:58,197
The Blue Moon Races
are the worst-kept secret of all time.

298
00:23:58,364 --> 00:24:00,821
I know. I almost had him.

299
00:24:00,991 --> 00:24:03,263
- I should have beaten him, easily.
- Wrong.

300
00:24:03,426 --> 00:24:05,817
You need more than raw talent,
which you have...

301
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,578
...to beat a well-trained racehorse.
It takes skill.

302
00:24:08,744 --> 00:24:12,131
Real skill and real discipline
to become a racer. It's hard work.

303
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,212
Nothing good ever comes easy.

304
00:24:15,632 --> 00:24:17,521
And speaking of hard work...

305
00:24:17,683 --> 00:24:21,298
Oh, boy. See you later, kid.
Good luck.

306
00:24:24,251 --> 00:24:26,491
Tractor's down, Stripes.

307
00:24:26,653 --> 00:24:29,242
Yeah, it's time to earn your keep.

308
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,864
Yeah.

309
00:24:32,677 --> 00:24:34,915
There you go. Easy, take it easy.

310
00:24:35,271 --> 00:24:37,346
Yeah, good boy.

311
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:40,775
There you go.

312
00:24:41,582 --> 00:24:45,230
Come on, now. Come on, Stripes,
just give it a little more.

313
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:48,398
Little more.
It's gonna be over that much quicker.

314
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:49,844
Come on, now.

315
00:24:50,007 --> 00:24:52,182
Come on. Come on.

316
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,736
Hey, sweetness.
Look at your bigtime racehorse now.

317
00:24:55,935 --> 00:24:58,426
Yeah, bigtime.

318
00:24:58,594 --> 00:24:59,839
Check it out.

319
00:25:00,004 --> 00:25:03,554
Hey, plow boy, you missed a spot!

320
00:25:05,514 --> 00:25:08,200
Why don't you guys
go choke on an apple.

321
00:25:08,364 --> 00:25:11,817
Come on, darling, don't go getting
your tail in a knot.

322
00:25:28,964 --> 00:25:31,620
Talk to me. You look frustrated,
what's the matter?

323
00:25:31,944 --> 00:25:36,072
What is it gonna take for me to get
to the track so I can have another shot?

324
00:25:36,237 --> 00:25:39,917
I won't blow sun up your tail.
You're from the wrong side of the fence.

325
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:41,937
The only chance you've got is...

326
00:25:42,101 --> 00:25:45,717
- Forget it, forget it, forget it.
- No. What? What were you gonna say?

327
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,753
You gotta get someone to ride you
so you can show them.

328
00:25:48,925 --> 00:25:50,649
- A human?
- No, we're gonna strap...

329
00:25:50,814 --> 00:25:55,521
...Reggie to your back. Of course a human.
So if you do get to race, you'll be ready.

330
00:25:55,683 --> 00:25:59,398
And pulling that thing can only help.
Put your back into it. Get to work.

331
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,214
Yeah. I will make it to the track, Tucker.

332
00:26:02,379 --> 00:26:06,214
And when I do, I'm gonna beat Pride
and win the big race.

333
00:26:09,556 --> 00:26:12,527
- Whoa, big fella!
- That's the attitude.

334
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,596
Well, like my mama used to say:

335
00:26:16,764 --> 00:26:21,373
"You can put your boots in the oven,
but that won't make them biscuits."

336
00:26:43,162 --> 00:26:45,019
Good boy.

337
00:26:47,423 --> 00:26:49,215
Good boy.

338
00:26:50,115 --> 00:26:52,287
You did all right, huh.

339
00:26:52,454 --> 00:26:54,146
Yeah.

340
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:04,717
Good boy.

341
00:27:15,264 --> 00:27:17,754
Hey, there's my best boy.

342
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:20,762
Been working you hard, hasn't he?

343
00:27:20,934 --> 00:27:22,945
I'll see you later.

344
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:29,319
All right.
I need to find a way to get rid of you.

345
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:31,083
That could be arranged.

346
00:27:32,531 --> 00:27:34,224
- Who are you?
- Name's Goose.

347
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:37,710
Always looking to do a favor
for someone that's been in the joint.

348
00:27:37,881 --> 00:27:39,607
- When'd you get out?
- Out of where?

349
00:27:39,772 --> 00:27:42,425
The pokey, the do-right ranch,
the iron-bar inn.

350
00:27:42,592 --> 00:27:46,175
- Come on, you can level with me.
- What are you talking about?

351
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:49,059
Oh, you're good.
Yes, you are, you are very good.

352
00:27:49,223 --> 00:27:53,865
So where did you do your stretch?
Sing Sing? Alcatraz? The Bronx Zoo?

353
00:27:54,028 --> 00:27:55,656
Look, how can you help?

354
00:27:56,527 --> 00:27:59,826
All right, listen up,
you glue-factory rejects.

355
00:27:59,986 --> 00:28:03,505
Professor Goose is gonna school youse
in how to take out a motorcycle.

356
00:28:03,671 --> 00:28:06,742
- Class is now in session.
- Will we be tested on this?

357
00:28:06,907 --> 00:28:10,556
Stuff it, McNugget. Rule number one,
we never say nothing.

358
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,374
Even when tortured,
not a word gets out.

359
00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:16,608
Watch this. Look out!
Freddy the Flamingo's right behind you.

360
00:28:16,775 --> 00:28:19,079
- Hey, Goose.
- All right, I'll talk, I'll talk.

361
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:22,562
It was Vito. Vito Pelligrino from Pier 9.

362
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:26,666
What do you know? Goose, who was really
a pelican, is really a stool pigeon...

363
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:29,106
...who is actually a chicken that ducks.

364
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:32,469
- That makes five birds in one, count them.
- I'm no chicken.

365
00:28:32,632 --> 00:28:34,708
Mind you, I got nothing
against chickens.

366
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:39,419
I mean, some of my best friends
are chickens. Fowl are fine folks.

367
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:41,692
All right, let's go, it's time.

368
00:28:41,859 --> 00:28:44,644
Now, you guys stay here.
This ain't gonna be pretty.

369
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:46,980
Oh, boy, now what do I do?

370
00:28:47,145 --> 00:28:50,795
All right, tough guy, we can do this
the easy way or the hard way.

371
00:28:51,149 --> 00:28:54,537
Gentlemen, don't let the feathers fool you,
this dude's dangerous.

372
00:28:54,707 --> 00:28:57,263
He's a killing machine
disguised as an idiot.

373
00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:00,215
Hey, you like that? Huh?
Right in the seat.

374
00:29:00,376 --> 00:29:02,551
Okay, lights out.

375
00:29:02,716 --> 00:29:05,053
Turning up the pain. You like that?

376
00:29:05,214 --> 00:29:06,907
Come on, can you hear me?

377
00:29:08,515 --> 00:29:11,486
Oh, a spitter, huh?
Oh, you wanna dance?

378
00:29:11,654 --> 00:29:13,282
You want a piece of the Goose?

379
00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:19,149
Karate-chop-a! Poke-a-sock-a!
Smack-a-face-a! Break-a-bones-a!

380
00:29:26,648 --> 00:29:32,186
You see?
You call the Goose, and ba-da-bing.

381
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:34,463
Ba-da-boom.

382
00:29:36,707 --> 00:29:39,940
This is Reggie Redrooster
with the farm report.

383
00:29:40,103 --> 00:29:44,263
In sports news, Goose the Pelican
dropped the motorcycle in the first round.

384
00:29:44,428 --> 00:29:48,459
Then, for good measure,
taught the truck a lesson as well.

385
00:29:50,129 --> 00:29:53,232
Move it along, nothing to see here.

386
00:29:53,687 --> 00:29:55,577
I'm gonna be late for work.

387
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,800
Well, you can take Old Blue.

388
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,238
Oh, that's just great.

389
00:30:06,406 --> 00:30:07,869
Oh, come on.

390
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,408
How long will it take
to put on the spare?

391
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,573
Honey, that is the spare.

392
00:30:13,741 --> 00:30:15,337
What the...?

393
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,801
Can I take Stripes?

394
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,641
- What do you mean, ride him?
- Just for today.

395
00:30:27,197 --> 00:30:29,338
No. No.

396
00:30:29,504 --> 00:30:32,606
Come on, I have to get to work.
Can I take him, please?

397
00:30:32,771 --> 00:30:33,949
Honey, no.

398
00:30:34,117 --> 00:30:36,803
Besides, I'd never be able
to get a saddle on him.

399
00:30:42,127 --> 00:30:45,577
All right, so I got a saddle on him,
big deal.

400
00:30:45,746 --> 00:30:48,204
Not like he's gonna let you ride him.

401
00:30:48,374 --> 00:30:51,825
- You don't know him like I do.
- Well...

402
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,903
...even if he does let you,
you know how I feel.

403
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,730
I've been riding since I was 5.

404
00:30:57,504 --> 00:31:00,736
- That's not the point.
- Come on.

405
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:03,870
I mean, it's almost like he wants
to be ridden.

406
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,563
Oh, honey. Honey, come on.

407
00:31:07,341 --> 00:31:09,611
Just let me try.

408
00:31:10,767 --> 00:31:12,559
Come on, come on.

409
00:31:17,271 --> 00:31:18,614
Careful.

410
00:31:26,592 --> 00:31:28,768
- Now we're talking.
- Talking to who?

411
00:31:28,932 --> 00:31:32,864
What you been talking about?
You been training Stripes, haven't you?

412
00:31:35,692 --> 00:31:37,668
Just nice and easy.

413
00:31:56,034 --> 00:31:58,242
Run like the wind.
Show them what you got.

414
00:31:58,406 --> 00:31:59,684
Will you shut up?

415
00:31:59,848 --> 00:32:03,266
I'm the coach, you're the goat.
Now, listen to the way it's done.

416
00:32:03,467 --> 00:32:05,805
Run like the wind, kid!
Show them what you got!

417
00:32:05,968 --> 00:32:07,561
See, that's coaching.

418
00:32:09,106 --> 00:32:11,411
Come on, Stripes. Come on.

419
00:32:16,155 --> 00:32:17,913
Come on, boy!

420
00:32:31,276 --> 00:32:33,767
Good boy.

421
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,954
Better get going back!
Circus must be in town!

422
00:32:46,204 --> 00:32:48,629
I used to see spots,
now I'm seeing stripes.

423
00:32:48,992 --> 00:32:50,587
Where'd that come from?

424
00:32:50,755 --> 00:32:53,475
Shouldn't you be
on a carousel somewhere?

425
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,761
- This ain't the zoo!
- Oh, no way.

426
00:32:59,084 --> 00:33:01,390
- Go home!
- Go home, four left hooves!

427
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:03,560
- Haven't you learned?
- You don't fit in!

428
00:33:03,729 --> 00:33:05,871
- Hoof it!
- We don't want you!

429
00:33:06,036 --> 00:33:08,974
- Nobody asked you here, freak!
- Yeah, no freaks allowed.

430
00:33:21,446 --> 00:33:24,449
I'll see you later, buddy. Be good.

431
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,481
Those guys aren't so fast.
I can take them.

432
00:33:45,409 --> 00:33:48,709
Scuzz, how can you ruin
a great song like that?

433
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:51,262
Oh, come on, man!
That song's already ruined.

434
00:33:51,433 --> 00:33:53,803
You need some good tunes like this:

435
00:34:01,621 --> 00:34:04,624
- Those aren't even the words.
- The words don't matter, man!

436
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,546
You know "you can't touch this,"
the rest of it's gold.

437
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:11,006
Okay, smart boy,
just go fly yourself into a fan.

438
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:14,170
Now, come on, let's go get some food.
Just follow me.

439
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:16,862
Waiter! Table for one, please.

440
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,270
Hey, why don't you take a closer look.

441
00:34:19,561 --> 00:34:21,636
I'll tell Mom!

442
00:34:23,759 --> 00:34:27,144
Scuzz, I don't believe it.
I got 20 million brothers and sisters...

443
00:34:27,314 --> 00:34:29,935
...and Mom tells me
that I gotta look out for you.

444
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:35,378
Well, that's because it's easy, dumb-dumb.
Nothing bad ever happens to me!

445
00:34:36,348 --> 00:34:40,991
Scuzz, you know what?
Bad is the only thing that happens to you!

446
00:34:41,154 --> 00:34:42,562
- Hey, pull my wing.
- No.

447
00:34:42,725 --> 00:34:46,110
It's not like before.
I promise, nothing will happen.

448
00:34:47,529 --> 00:34:50,315
Never, never fall for that. It's too easy!

449
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:00,149
Who does that thing belong to?

450
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:10,335
He's mine, Miss Dalrymple.
I had no other way of getting here.

451
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:15,398
- I'll go put him in the stables.
- Yes, and from now on...

452
00:35:15,562 --> 00:35:20,488
...you will leave him at that petting zoo you
and your father so laughably call a farm.

453
00:35:20,656 --> 00:35:23,692
This is a racetrack, dear,
not the Serengeti.

454
00:35:30,266 --> 00:35:32,308
You don't know the words
to that either.

455
00:35:32,477 --> 00:35:34,333
I can make up a rap about anything.

456
00:35:39,942 --> 00:35:41,603
Hey. Hey, what's that?

457
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:44,521
Well, that's obvious.
It's the racetrack referee.

458
00:35:44,682 --> 00:35:49,030
Buzz, check this out.
Hey, pal, why the long face?

459
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:53,361
- Thank you!
- "Why the long face?"

460
00:35:53,524 --> 00:35:55,699
- Still got it!
- What are you doing? Look.

461
00:35:55,865 --> 00:35:59,348
You're a horse!
You all have long faces, get it?

462
00:35:59,516 --> 00:36:01,974
- It's a joke!
- I've heard all the jokes.

463
00:36:02,144 --> 00:36:04,896
The others have been making fun
of me since I was born.

464
00:36:05,059 --> 00:36:07,811
- I know I'm different.
- You think you had it rough?

465
00:36:07,975 --> 00:36:11,776
You try starting out life as a maggot.
Nobody wants to pet a little maggot.

466
00:36:11,947 --> 00:36:14,535
- Nobody.
- Scuzz, Scuzz, Scuzz. Come on, now. Easy.

467
00:36:14,702 --> 00:36:18,568
Seriously, what's with the stripes?
Are you making some kind of statement?

468
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:20,201
Yeah, you know, I saw you...

469
00:36:20,372 --> 00:36:22,612
...and I was about to say
to my brother Buzz:

470
00:36:22,775 --> 00:36:25,299
"I never seen a black horse
with white stripes."

471
00:36:25,466 --> 00:36:30,207
You dimwit! He is obviously
a white horse with black stripes!

472
00:36:30,367 --> 00:36:31,799
Now, anybody could see that.

473
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:35,167
Guys, look out!

474
00:36:40,652 --> 00:36:42,957
- Are we dead? Are we dead?
- Well, if we are...

475
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,030
...Buzz, we're in heaven!

476
00:36:53,113 --> 00:36:55,004
Here comes your open winner, Miss D.

477
00:36:55,164 --> 00:36:57,589
Yes, well, he better be, Mr. Cooper.

478
00:36:57,761 --> 00:37:01,080
Anything less than a victory,
and you'll be back shoveling manure.

479
00:37:20,602 --> 00:37:23,223
- See you, Woodzie.
- Night, Ken.

480
00:37:32,071 --> 00:37:35,555
What are you doing, boy?
We shouldn't be out here.

481
00:37:42,772 --> 00:37:44,815
I know, boy.

482
00:37:44,981 --> 00:37:47,220
I feel it too.

483
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,738
When I was little...

484
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,700
...my mama used to bring me out here
at around this time.

485
00:37:57,669 --> 00:38:00,060
Put me on the saddle behind her...

486
00:38:00,263 --> 00:38:02,918
...take me once around the track.

487
00:38:06,608 --> 00:38:08,398
It was like magic.

488
00:38:13,816 --> 00:38:16,239
Come on, boy! Come on!

489
00:38:17,372 --> 00:38:19,928
Go! Let's go, boy!

490
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:29,831
Easy, boy. Come on.

491
00:38:29,994 --> 00:38:32,265
Attaboy.

492
00:38:32,429 --> 00:38:34,374
Easy does it.

493
00:38:37,907 --> 00:38:39,370
Good boy.

494
00:38:39,637 --> 00:38:41,233
Channing!

495
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:43,922
- Hold on a second.
- Woodzie.

496
00:38:44,347 --> 00:38:48,607
- You're not gonna tell anyone, are you?
- Mum's the word.

497
00:38:48,863 --> 00:38:50,328
Well, who's your friend?

498
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:53,250
- Some turn of foot.
- This is Stripes.

499
00:38:53,413 --> 00:38:55,618
- He's quick, huh?
- I'll say.

500
00:38:55,784 --> 00:38:58,404
Like to get a watch on him for real.

501
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:01,797
Dad doesn't want me to ride,
let alone race.

502
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:05,801
Well, that's a crime.
You move just like your mom.

503
00:39:06,098 --> 00:39:09,682
God rest her soul.
And not even a proper saddle.

504
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:13,747
A trainer friend of mine's working
some horses in the time trial tomorrow.

505
00:39:13,917 --> 00:39:16,768
Why don't you come out early
and join in.

506
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:20,795
Yeah, you think about it.

507
00:39:30,191 --> 00:39:31,655
Hey.

508
00:39:31,825 --> 00:39:34,000
Forget where the house is?

509
00:39:34,292 --> 00:39:36,563
Miss Dalrymple made me stay late.

510
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:41,559
- I can't stand her.
- Don't give me excuses.

511
00:39:41,725 --> 00:39:45,024
And don't take it out on her.
If anything, you should pity her.

512
00:39:45,184 --> 00:39:48,450
She sees a horse, she doesn't see beauty.
She just sees business.

513
00:39:48,613 --> 00:39:51,748
I don't see how you ever worked for her.
She's such a pain.

514
00:39:51,913 --> 00:39:54,337
I let most of it go in one ear
and out the other.

515
00:39:54,507 --> 00:39:57,992
It was worth it. I got a chance to work
with some mighty fine horses.

516
00:39:58,449 --> 00:40:00,840
We could do it again, you know.

517
00:40:04,534 --> 00:40:06,097
- Chan...
- Dad...

518
00:40:06,265 --> 00:40:08,472
...everybody says you're still the best.

519
00:40:08,635 --> 00:40:11,160
We just need a few horses
to get us started.

520
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:13,916
Then we could put old Dalrymple
out to pasture.

521
00:40:14,082 --> 00:40:15,644
That's in the past, honey.

522
00:40:15,971 --> 00:40:18,910
I fixed the flat.
You can take Blue to work tomorrow.

523
00:40:19,785 --> 00:40:21,314
But I wanna ride Stripes.

524
00:40:23,853 --> 00:40:26,093
He was great, Dad.
You should've seen him!

525
00:40:28,562 --> 00:40:31,086
That was a one-shot deal.

526
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,941
You know how I feel.

527
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:35,608
- What about how I feel?
- Discussion's over.

528
00:40:35,771 --> 00:40:37,530
- But, Dad...
- I said no, Chan.

529
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:42,496
You are so busy trying to keep me
from hurting myself like Mom...

530
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:46,209
...that you won't give me a chance
to just try anything.

531
00:40:49,035 --> 00:40:53,295
Well, just because you've given up
on your dreams doesn't mean that I have to.

532
00:41:02,587 --> 00:41:05,625
He treats me like I'm still a little girl.

533
00:41:08,993 --> 00:41:10,457
Well, I'm not.

534
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:13,373
I wanna race.

535
00:41:16,234 --> 00:41:17,959
I'm gonna race...

536
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,837
...and no one can stop me.

537
00:41:59,003 --> 00:42:02,389
Doesn't anybody have a clock?

538
00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:21,198
Easy, girl.

539
00:42:29,919 --> 00:42:32,409
Hey! It's Woodzie.

540
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,836
No! Help me! I'm drowning!

541
00:42:36,998 --> 00:42:39,871
Get out of there, Scuzz!
That's the man's expresso!

542
00:42:40,042 --> 00:42:41,955
I know.

543
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:44,811
I'm expressing myself.

544
00:42:45,426 --> 00:42:49,041
You are the reason
they invented fly swatters.

545
00:42:49,589 --> 00:42:53,521
There are those that say Trenton's Pride
is the only real contender this year.

546
00:42:53,691 --> 00:42:57,468
- How do you feel about that?
- Well, dear, how do you feel about that?

547
00:42:57,631 --> 00:43:01,858
Miss Dalrymple, how does Trenton's Pride
compare with his legendary father?

548
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,373
Well, I like to believe that
I can see a good bet, and l...

549
00:43:05,545 --> 00:43:08,810
What...? Where's...? What the...?

550
00:43:08,971 --> 00:43:12,041
Excuse me. Excuse me!

551
00:43:13,874 --> 00:43:16,943
I can't believe we're being upstaged
by a zebra.

552
00:43:17,109 --> 00:43:19,445
What is that dreadful child up to now?

553
00:43:19,608 --> 00:43:21,716
How can they allow this to happen?

554
00:43:24,221 --> 00:43:25,947
- Eat my dust, runt!
- Loser!

555
00:43:26,527 --> 00:43:29,379
I'm gonna run you down!
Who do you think you are?

556
00:43:31,045 --> 00:43:32,356
You don't belong here!

557
00:43:35,018 --> 00:43:37,639
You don't know nothing about this!

558
00:43:38,862 --> 00:43:40,839
You're a joke!

559
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,368
It's all right, boy. It's all right.

560
00:43:59,302 --> 00:44:02,621
Let's go, boy! Whoa, whoa, Stripes.

561
00:44:08,496 --> 00:44:10,800
Come on, come on, boy!
Come on, Stripes!

562
00:44:10,996 --> 00:44:12,656
Come on!

563
00:44:12,822 --> 00:44:14,896
Come on, boy! Come on!

564
00:44:15,064 --> 00:44:16,757
Faster! Come on, buddy!

565
00:44:23,586 --> 00:44:25,497
Attaboy!

566
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:27,650
Faster, Stripes, faster! Come on!

567
00:44:31,305 --> 00:44:34,409
Who would have thought a zebra
could have such a kick?

568
00:44:50,881 --> 00:44:53,754
He's on the rail and moving fast.

569
00:45:09,848 --> 00:45:11,540
Chan!

570
00:45:12,345 --> 00:45:14,716
- Oh, my.
- Come on, come on, let's go!

571
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,301
You better make sure you get this, Mike.

572
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,258
Chan!

573
00:45:20,421 --> 00:45:21,632
- Chan!
- Nothing's broken.

574
00:45:21,796 --> 00:45:23,293
Honey, just look in my eyes.

575
00:45:23,463 --> 00:45:24,894
- Dad, it's nothing.
- Listen.

576
00:45:25,065 --> 00:45:28,647
- It's fine.
- This is what I told you was gonna happen.

577
00:45:28,814 --> 00:45:32,079
- Your father's right.
- He just got spooked. It's not his fault.

578
00:45:32,241 --> 00:45:34,666
- He just needs some more training.
- Yes, right.

579
00:45:34,836 --> 00:45:39,446
I'm sure that more than half of the blame
sits squarely on the shoulders of his rider.

580
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:41,521
- You're such a...
- Chan. Chan, Chan!

581
00:45:41,691 --> 00:45:44,565
Just go get Stripes
and meet me in the parking lot.

582
00:45:46,946 --> 00:45:49,501
You so obsessed with winning
you'll pick on a girl?

583
00:45:49,926 --> 00:45:53,858
Really, Nolan.
You expect me to dignify that?

584
00:45:54,186 --> 00:45:58,664
I'm just a Kentucky gal who loves watching
Thoroughbreds race at the top of their game.

585
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:01,132
Of course you are.

586
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:05,004
I'll tell you what.

587
00:46:05,431 --> 00:46:08,338
As chairman of the Turfway Board...

588
00:46:08,507 --> 00:46:10,931
...I hereby extend an invitation
to Mr. Walsh...

589
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:14,850
...to enter his zebra in the Kentucky Open.

590
00:46:17,445 --> 00:46:19,651
All it takes is an entrance fee.

591
00:46:24,685 --> 00:46:26,214
How about that, Mr. Walsh?

592
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:28,622
- Mr. Walsh?
- Mr. Walsh?

593
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:31,407
Well, there goes the great Nolan Walsh,
everyone.

594
00:46:31,574 --> 00:46:35,255
Corn farmer and zebra trainer.
And you can print that.

595
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:39,700
Hey, Clara, can they print that you
ain't won the Kentucky Open...

596
00:46:39,872 --> 00:46:42,974
...since Nolan stopped training
your horses for you?

597
00:46:43,138 --> 00:46:46,208
- What do you have to say about that?
- Mind your own business.

598
00:46:48,938 --> 00:46:52,554
You there! See what happens
when you forget your place.

599
00:46:52,718 --> 00:46:55,176
A racetrack is no place for a zebra.

600
00:46:55,344 --> 00:46:57,553
- What did you just call me?
- A zebra!

601
00:46:57,715 --> 00:46:58,894
Which is what you are.

602
00:46:59,063 --> 00:47:01,585
You didn't really think
you were a horse, did you?

603
00:47:01,753 --> 00:47:04,210
But I am a horse. A racehorse.

604
00:47:04,379 --> 00:47:05,755
You're nothing of the kind.

605
00:47:05,918 --> 00:47:08,156
You're lunch for a lion,
and that's about it.

606
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:12,803
One thing's for sure, kid.
You will never be a racehorse.

607
00:47:19,246 --> 00:47:21,866
A zebra? I thought I was a racehorse.

608
00:47:22,031 --> 00:47:24,172
Why didn't anyone tell me?

609
00:47:31,578 --> 00:47:34,429
Well, I just can't believe
you deliberately disobeyed me.

610
00:47:35,231 --> 00:47:37,534
- I can't believe you took her side.
- I didn't.

611
00:47:37,698 --> 00:47:39,708
And don't change the subject.

612
00:47:39,909 --> 00:47:43,260
- Mom would've let me ride.
- Don't bring your mother into this!

613
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,806
Just don't.

614
00:47:44,971 --> 00:47:46,280
Why not?

615
00:47:46,444 --> 00:47:50,475
At least she would've tried to understand.
It's more than I can say for you!

616
00:47:50,641 --> 00:47:52,268
Don't get out of the truck!

617
00:47:52,852 --> 00:47:55,156
Channing, get back in the truck.

618
00:47:55,511 --> 00:47:57,335
Don't do it.

619
00:48:39,497 --> 00:48:41,026
Well, well, well.

620
00:48:41,194 --> 00:48:44,068
Look what the cat drug in.

621
00:48:51,191 --> 00:48:53,201
Don't shoot me, don't shoot me!

622
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:54,746
Jersey flashback.

623
00:48:58,911 --> 00:49:01,817
Hey, we made it, man! Nice!
That sure beats flying.

624
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,647
We made it, but...

625
00:49:03,813 --> 00:49:06,467
- Well, little Skeeter here didn't.
- Oh, no.

626
00:49:06,633 --> 00:49:08,523
You know, that's why Mom always said:

627
00:49:08,682 --> 00:49:11,882
- "Look both ways before crossing."
- "Look both ways before crossing."

628
00:49:12,944 --> 00:49:14,768
Afternoon, Woodzie.

629
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:18,061
- What brings you out here?
- I got a hunch about your zebra.

630
00:49:19,577 --> 00:49:20,854
Look at this.

631
00:49:21,017 --> 00:49:23,321
I left it right where it was
this morning.

632
00:49:25,182 --> 00:49:28,088
- Twenty-three seconds a quarter mile?
- He didn't finish...

633
00:49:28,258 --> 00:49:31,644
...but I got him between the quarter pole
and the half-mile pole.

634
00:49:31,814 --> 00:49:33,341
Twenty-three flat.

635
00:49:33,575 --> 00:49:35,466
Your zebra.

636
00:49:39,663 --> 00:49:44,011
Look, that zebra really wants to race.
I can see it.

637
00:49:44,179 --> 00:49:47,052
You just need to train him.

638
00:49:47,576 --> 00:49:49,650
Where would I do that?

639
00:49:49,915 --> 00:49:51,957
And even if I could, I mean...

640
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:54,298
...you got the $5000 entrance fee?
I don't.

641
00:49:54,496 --> 00:49:57,532
I do. And I won most of it
betting on your horses.

642
00:49:58,564 --> 00:50:02,759
I know a good bet when I see it,
and I can't bet him if he's not in the race.

643
00:50:03,402 --> 00:50:05,673
Come on, Nolan.

644
00:50:06,574 --> 00:50:09,774
No. That's final.

645
00:50:10,162 --> 00:50:14,193
Too poor to paint,
too proud to whitewash.

646
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:16,783
He's not gonna let Stripes race.
That's not cool.

647
00:50:16,954 --> 00:50:18,898
Let's go talk to Tucker.

648
00:50:20,574 --> 00:50:22,616
- Guess who.
- Hey, Buzz and Scuzz!

649
00:50:22,785 --> 00:50:24,445
How you been, fellas?

650
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:27,515
- We miss you down at the track.
- Those were great years.

651
00:50:27,686 --> 00:50:30,985
Yeah, yeah. Listen, listen.
We got some bad news for Stripes.

652
00:50:31,146 --> 00:50:35,112
Let me guess. His parole officers caught up
with him. Don't let them take you.

653
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:37,033
Is he always like this?

654
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:39,625
- Worse. Much worse.
- Anyway, listen, kid.

655
00:50:39,797 --> 00:50:43,892
- The Chief isn't gonna let you race.
- But don't worry. We'll cheer you up.

656
00:50:44,057 --> 00:50:45,553
Check this one out.

657
00:50:56,455 --> 00:50:58,979
Get off me, you stupid flies! Get off!

658
00:50:59,146 --> 00:51:01,931
Man, "Ebony and Ivory" didn't work.
That's a first.

659
00:51:02,094 --> 00:51:04,070
- Told you we should've rapped.
- Stripes.

660
00:51:04,432 --> 00:51:06,704
Walking away isn't gonna solve anything.

661
00:51:06,995 --> 00:51:08,852
Who cares. Leave me alone!

662
00:51:09,013 --> 00:51:12,760
- We've gotta get this kid into the race.
- The Chief will never go for it.

663
00:51:13,114 --> 00:51:15,606
Of course he will.
Just like somebody else I know.

664
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:17,685
He just needs a little push.

665
00:51:20,258 --> 00:51:22,235
I'm going to bed.

666
00:51:22,694 --> 00:51:24,583
Channing?

667
00:51:29,069 --> 00:51:31,856
- Yeah?
- Why don't you come on out here.

668
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:35,023
Come on.

669
00:51:42,077 --> 00:51:44,895
This is gonna be a hard one, honey.

670
00:51:45,504 --> 00:51:48,671
Probably the only thing to do,
really the obvious thing...

671
00:51:48,963 --> 00:51:51,137
...is to get rid of the problem.

672
00:51:51,463 --> 00:51:53,090
What?

673
00:51:53,897 --> 00:51:55,360
Dad.

674
00:51:55,532 --> 00:51:57,290
No!

675
00:51:57,454 --> 00:52:01,037
It's not Stripes' fault.
He's not the problem. It's my fault.

676
00:52:01,938 --> 00:52:04,790
Dad, you can't just get rid of him.

677
00:52:04,983 --> 00:52:08,598
l... I know him
better than anyone ever could.

678
00:52:10,045 --> 00:52:11,672
I love him.

679
00:52:13,633 --> 00:52:16,188
What do you think the alternative is?

680
00:52:17,765 --> 00:52:19,906
I don't ride him.

681
00:52:27,761 --> 00:52:29,771
Ever, ever again.

682
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,909
That's right, honey.

683
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:17,153
Franny?

684
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:21,379
Hey.

685
00:53:28,014 --> 00:53:29,773
Hey.

686
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,929
How did you know?

687
00:55:40,006 --> 00:55:43,272
If you build it, they will come.

688
00:55:43,468 --> 00:55:46,569
Well, it's showtime, kid.
You ready to start training?

689
00:55:47,665 --> 00:55:49,554
Why bother?

690
00:55:50,419 --> 00:55:53,488
I don't understand this.
Isn't this what he wanted?

691
00:55:53,654 --> 00:55:55,991
This is exactly why I never had kids.

692
00:55:56,154 --> 00:55:57,584
- Reggie?
- Yes?

693
00:55:57,755 --> 00:55:59,732
Get off my back.

694
00:56:11,531 --> 00:56:12,777
Hey, hotshot.

695
00:56:13,102 --> 00:56:16,651
- Run into any trees lately?
- Oh, great. More jokes.

696
00:56:16,818 --> 00:56:19,888
- I really wanna be alone, Sandy.
- What's going on with you?

697
00:56:20,053 --> 00:56:22,642
That doesn't sound like the attitude
of a racehorse.

698
00:56:22,809 --> 00:56:26,009
Because I'm not a racehorse.
I'm not even a regular horse.

699
00:56:26,173 --> 00:56:28,117
- I'm a...
- Zebra?

700
00:56:28,287 --> 00:56:31,137
I know. I've traveled
around the world, remember?

701
00:56:31,298 --> 00:56:32,761
Why didn't you say anything?

702
00:56:32,932 --> 00:56:35,805
Because I don't care
that you're not a racehorse.

703
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:38,313
You love to run,
and that's all that matters.

704
00:56:38,474 --> 00:56:42,308
Maybe to you.
But it's not your problem, Sandy.

705
00:56:43,023 --> 00:56:46,890
You know, if you wanna see
the real problem, try looking down.

706
00:56:47,061 --> 00:56:48,622
Fine.

707
00:56:59,043 --> 00:57:01,282
After we're done with the gate...

708
00:57:01,445 --> 00:57:03,782
...we need to think about
how he's gonna last.

709
00:57:03,944 --> 00:57:06,335
So we gotta work on stamina,
more than speed...

710
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:08,484
...because zebras burn more adrenaline.

711
00:57:08,653 --> 00:57:11,308
They have a heightened flight reflex...

712
00:57:11,794 --> 00:57:14,611
...that comes from being hunted
on the plains of Africa.

713
00:57:15,509 --> 00:57:17,814
You're not the only one who uses
the Internet.

714
00:57:18,135 --> 00:57:21,041
- Impressive, Dad.
- Come on, let's get back to it.

715
00:57:21,212 --> 00:57:23,452
Let's give him one more shot at it.

716
00:57:23,646 --> 00:57:26,137
All right, bring him in. That's it, that's it.

717
00:57:26,659 --> 00:57:28,286
Careful, Chan. Careful.

718
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:34,435
It's all right. Stop. Walk him away.
Now, just walk him away from the gate.

719
00:57:34,764 --> 00:57:37,034
The gate's always trouble.
They should know.

720
00:57:37,198 --> 00:57:40,267
He needs a break. He needs a break.
So do I.

721
00:57:41,042 --> 00:57:45,271
- I don't know why he's acting like this.
- It's gonna take him some time, that's all.

722
00:57:45,432 --> 00:57:47,288
He'll be all right.

723
00:57:56,004 --> 00:58:00,133
- I better go talk to the kid.
- Take it easy on him.

724
00:58:02,667 --> 00:58:05,224
- Hey, what's your problem?
- I'm not a racehorse.

725
00:58:05,391 --> 00:58:07,368
- What?
- I don't belong in the gate!

726
00:58:07,537 --> 00:58:09,744
No, no, you're wrong.
And I'll tell you why.

727
00:58:09,908 --> 00:58:13,741
Racing is for anyone.
Anyone with a fire in their heart.

728
00:58:14,362 --> 00:58:17,846
What do you know, you little nobody?
You never raced.

729
00:58:22,179 --> 00:58:24,252
They're all the same.

730
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:26,558
Tucker doesn't understand.

731
00:58:26,727 --> 00:58:30,856
He didn't even know that I was a zebra.
He doesn't get it. What's he ever done?

732
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:34,253
Let me tell you something.
I've made a few clams on the ponies.

733
00:58:34,416 --> 00:58:36,623
This guy's all hair and no brains.

734
00:58:36,787 --> 00:58:40,173
That's just about enough out of you,
young colt. And, Goose, bang!

735
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:42,580
Hit the hay!

736
00:58:43,034 --> 00:58:45,371
Come here.
People think they know everything.

737
00:58:45,534 --> 00:58:48,057
You tell somebody something,
they get an attitude.

738
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:51,009
Hey, I didn't know the goat
was packing.

739
00:58:52,742 --> 00:58:55,592
Come up here.
I want you to take a look up there.

740
00:58:55,754 --> 00:58:57,992
- You tell me what you see.
- I've seen them.

741
00:58:58,316 --> 00:59:03,855
- The Chief, my girl and her mother.
- And that's it? No. Look closer.

742
00:59:04,242 --> 00:59:06,134
- That's Sir Trenton.
- And who else?

743
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:08,335
- Tucker.
- That's right, Tucker.

744
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:11,889
He trained Sir Trenton.
He and the Chief trained all the winners.

745
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,484
And not one of them ever,
ever thanked him.

746
00:59:15,232 --> 00:59:17,820
- How come he never said anything?
- Because to him...

747
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:20,990
...actions speak louder than words.
He believes in you.

748
00:59:21,158 --> 00:59:23,845
And now you're gonna
have to believe in him too.

749
00:59:29,456 --> 00:59:33,738
I'm sorry for the way I've been acting. I'm
the last one who should be name-calling.

750
00:59:33,908 --> 00:59:37,012
Look at me. When you got shorter legs
than a sheepdog...

751
00:59:37,177 --> 00:59:40,029
...you get used to being made fun of.
I can relate.

752
00:59:40,187 --> 00:59:41,913
It's just...

753
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,220
I'm not really a racehorse.

754
00:59:44,385 --> 00:59:46,209
I'm a...

755
00:59:46,467 --> 00:59:48,324
- I'm a zebra.
- So what?

756
00:59:48,486 --> 00:59:51,588
You're a horse with stripes
who needs an attitude adjustment.

757
00:59:51,946 --> 00:59:55,178
Tucker, you don't really think
I have what it takes, do you?

758
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:57,166
Now listen to me, kid. You're right.

759
00:59:57,328 --> 01:00:00,681
You don't have the strength or ability
of a Thoroughbred...

760
01:00:00,852 --> 01:00:04,303
- I knew it.
...but you have got more heart...

761
01:00:04,473 --> 01:00:06,613
...than all of them put together.

762
01:00:07,163 --> 01:00:10,812
But the gate! I freeze up.
It keeps me from running.

763
01:00:11,008 --> 01:00:12,985
I don't know what it is. I can't do it.

764
01:00:13,154 --> 01:00:15,524
Most horses are afraid of
the gate at first.

765
01:00:15,684 --> 01:00:18,688
It's perfectly normal.
But they get over it. You will too.

766
01:00:18,857 --> 01:00:22,408
You just keep running, okay?
And let the Chief worry about the gate.

767
01:00:22,573 --> 01:00:24,582
He knows what he's doing.

768
01:00:36,156 --> 01:00:37,467
Attaboy!

769
01:00:42,917 --> 01:00:44,512
Yeah, boy!

770
01:01:00,633 --> 01:01:03,189
Did you see that? You see that?
Good job, Chan!

771
01:01:03,613 --> 01:01:06,136
There it is! That's what I'm talking about!

772
01:01:08,066 --> 01:01:10,239
Good job, Chan! Walk him out.

773
01:01:10,597 --> 01:01:12,322
We might actually have a chance.

774
01:01:12,486 --> 01:01:16,036
If we're lucky, maybe at 99-1.

775
01:01:16,203 --> 01:01:18,410
There's just one thing left to work on.

776
01:01:18,573 --> 01:01:20,878
- And that's the gate.
- No problem.

777
01:01:21,041 --> 01:01:23,213
You've worked every kind
of horse there is.

778
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:25,683
Yeah, well, the problem is,
he's not a horse.

779
01:01:25,846 --> 01:01:29,779
Relax, Nolan.
If anyone can do it, you can.

780
01:01:29,946 --> 01:01:31,891
I'm counting on it.

781
01:01:38,341 --> 01:01:40,230
It's gonna sound like a carnival.

782
01:01:40,486 --> 01:01:43,241
You won't know which way to look.
Look straight ahead.

783
01:01:43,498 --> 01:01:47,726
Just ignore all that noise, all that talk,
all that yelling, all that jiggling.

784
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:50,124
Come on, now.

785
01:01:51,028 --> 01:01:53,234
You gotta let all this...

786
01:01:53,398 --> 01:01:55,735
This out of your mind.

787
01:01:55,896 --> 01:01:58,354
All that's gotta fall away.

788
01:01:58,845 --> 01:02:00,734
That's right. That's right.

789
01:02:00,895 --> 01:02:03,714
Because I want your world
to be silent.

790
01:02:03,937 --> 01:02:07,969
I want you to hear nothing
but your own heartbeat.

791
01:02:10,152 --> 01:02:11,878
That's it.

792
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:16,040
Easy does it. Come on, buddy.

793
01:02:16,208 --> 01:02:18,666
- That's a good boy.
- Good boy.

794
01:02:18,834 --> 01:02:21,140
- Good boy.
- That's it. You got the idea.

795
01:02:21,303 --> 01:02:23,092
- Come on, now.
- Good job, Stripes.

796
01:02:23,256 --> 01:02:27,003
Good boy. Chan, duck your head.
That's not so hard. Slow down.

797
01:02:27,165 --> 01:02:31,512
- Good boy. Easy does it.
- Good boy. Just like that. There you go.

798
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:35,780
Good.

799
01:02:37,384 --> 01:02:38,728
That's right, good boy.

800
01:02:39,179 --> 01:02:41,352
Attaboy.

801
01:02:42,735 --> 01:02:43,980
Easy does it.

802
01:02:44,369 --> 01:02:46,475
Good boy.

803
01:02:50,296 --> 01:02:53,081
- You did it.
- Yeah, I guess I did, huh?

804
01:02:53,244 --> 01:02:54,838
Now what?

805
01:02:55,006 --> 01:02:57,047
Now you give it all you got.

806
01:03:02,758 --> 01:03:05,794
- Let's show them what we got!
- They cannot be serious.

807
01:03:06,121 --> 01:03:10,862
This will not stand. I will not allow
that beast to run in my competition.

808
01:03:11,023 --> 01:03:14,288
Please, Father, don't interfere.
I can win it, fair and square.

809
01:03:14,964 --> 01:03:17,650
That's not a risk I'm willing to take.

810
01:03:23,517 --> 01:03:26,172
Double Pride's workout schedule.

811
01:03:46,775 --> 01:03:50,195
Pull! Pull! Come on, pull!

812
01:04:28,778 --> 01:04:31,847
Come on, Scuzz! What are you
doing here? Give it to me! Push!

813
01:04:32,013 --> 01:04:35,431
I can't do no more, take it!
Put the marshmallows back on!

814
01:04:35,602 --> 01:04:37,097
You ate the marshmallows!

815
01:04:37,267 --> 01:04:40,369
Stretch him out! Lighten up on him!
Lighten up on him!

816
01:05:03,697 --> 01:05:05,675
Boy, are you in for a surprise.

817
01:05:07,285 --> 01:05:09,874
You'll never beat a Trenton.

818
01:05:22,086 --> 01:05:25,636
- You weren't supposed to hear that.
- Oh, God, what is that?

819
01:05:25,803 --> 01:05:29,451
I got a million eyes,
and you got every one of them burning!

820
01:05:33,107 --> 01:05:36,111
- Well, tomorrow's the big day, kid.
- Do you think I'm ready?

821
01:05:36,279 --> 01:05:39,961
Absolutely. Listen, you can run,
there's no doubt about that.

822
01:05:40,124 --> 01:05:43,477
Your legs are gonna be burning
when you're turning for home.

823
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:45,952
That's when you find out
what you're made of.

824
01:05:46,114 --> 01:05:50,527
You know what I used to tell my racers?
"Don't look back, leave it all on the track."

825
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:55,240
- What does that mean?
- Kid, when the time is right, you'll know.

826
01:06:05,721 --> 01:06:07,250
Hello?

827
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:11,414
Where you think you going?
You have a big day tomorrow. You can't go.

828
01:06:12,321 --> 01:06:14,876
I need to make things right with Sandy.

829
01:06:15,492 --> 01:06:18,179
All right. I understand.

830
01:06:18,343 --> 01:06:20,899
But listen, a little advice
from an old goat:

831
01:06:21,323 --> 01:06:26,599
Relationships are like racing. When you do it
for love, you've already won.

832
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:29,136
Go on, go on.

833
01:06:37,887 --> 01:06:39,415
- Hey, Sandy.
- What?

834
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:43,644
I was hoping you'd come by.

835
01:06:46,407 --> 01:06:48,832
- I'm sorry that I was mean.
- I'm sorry that l...

836
01:06:49,228 --> 01:06:52,941
- You go first.
- The things I said the other day?

837
01:06:53,104 --> 01:06:56,938
- I just wanna say I was wrong.
- Well, yeah.

838
01:06:57,974 --> 01:07:00,945
You just... You got me so mad
because you weren't seeing it!

839
01:07:01,114 --> 01:07:03,505
- Seeing what?
- How lucky you are.

840
01:07:03,675 --> 01:07:05,172
- Me, lucky?
- Yes.

841
01:07:05,342 --> 01:07:07,897
The grass is way greener on your side
of the fence.

842
01:07:08,065 --> 01:07:11,998
Look at the training facilities. You've got
everything a horse could dream of.

843
01:07:12,165 --> 01:07:14,308
Yeah, everything except real friends.

844
01:07:14,472 --> 01:07:18,371
Friends like you have.
And a friend like I bet you are.

845
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:25,355
Listen, Sandy, I know I don't look
like a racehorse, but...

846
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,694
Stop! Stop.

847
01:07:28,151 --> 01:07:32,379
You know, I care more about what's on the
inside, and you have more on the inside...

848
01:07:32,541 --> 01:07:36,855
...than any of the horses over there.
And I also happen to think...

849
01:07:37,027 --> 01:07:41,155
...that what you have on the outside
is the cutest thing on four hooves.

850
01:07:43,369 --> 01:07:47,848
And, just so you know,
I'm already on your side.

851
01:07:58,428 --> 01:08:01,879
Well, well, well. What have we here?

852
01:08:02,624 --> 01:08:05,924
- Beauty and the beast.
- Oh, no. Sir Trenton.

853
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:08,508
I'm afraid there's been
a change of plans, zebra.

854
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,880
You're about to get scratched
from tomorrow's racecard.

855
01:08:12,041 --> 01:08:16,488
- Oh, no. There are so many.
- It's okay. Let's stay calm.

856
01:08:16,912 --> 01:08:21,227
- Pretty picture, huh, boys?
- Don't do this, Sir Trenton, please!

857
01:08:21,525 --> 01:08:24,016
- Take her away.
- All right, boss.

858
01:08:24,184 --> 01:08:25,265
- Let's go.
- Sandy!

859
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:27,707
Stripes, I'm not going
anywhere without you!

860
01:08:27,869 --> 01:08:29,878
- It's all right, Sandy. Just go.
- Yeah!

861
01:08:30,047 --> 01:08:32,253
Better hide your eyes there, honey!

862
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:36,387
We're out of here. Trust me,
you don't wanna see this.

863
01:08:36,551 --> 01:08:39,140
- You better not hurt her.
- Oh, don't fret about her.

864
01:08:39,306 --> 01:08:43,140
As long as you don't race tomorrow,
I wouldn't dream of harming her.

865
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:46,184
You, on the other hand,
need to be taught a lesson.

866
01:08:46,354 --> 01:08:48,180
Show him!

867
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:07,978
Oh, that's just great!
The race is in four hours.

868
01:09:08,139 --> 01:09:11,755
Well, he went out last night,
he said he was gonna go find Sandy and...

869
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,575
And you, Miss Softy,
you just let him go, didn't you?

870
01:09:14,739 --> 01:09:17,590
- Goose, time to earn your keep.
- I'm on it!

871
01:09:23,389 --> 01:09:25,814
Where are you, kid? Where are you?

872
01:09:37,261 --> 01:09:39,019
Looks like the work of a pro.

873
01:09:39,183 --> 01:09:43,411
Hey, kid. Kid, come on, wake up!
How many wings am I holding up?

874
01:09:47,738 --> 01:09:50,523
- Is he okay?
- Goose, go get him some water.

875
01:09:55,683 --> 01:09:58,206
I knew I should've stayed with him
last night.

876
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:10,673
They have Sandy.
Sir Trenton's gonna hurt her if I race.

877
01:10:10,835 --> 01:10:14,998
Those dirty rats. I say we get busy
and show those bums what for!

878
01:10:16,122 --> 01:10:19,475
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
No, you right. You are right.

879
01:10:19,646 --> 01:10:23,513
Let us go and kick some horse flank.
Come on, y'all!

880
01:10:23,683 --> 01:10:25,922
Let's move in with the SWAT team!

881
01:10:27,848 --> 01:10:30,533
Quiet!

882
01:10:31,659 --> 01:10:36,553
Thank you. Now, listen. To rescue Sandy,
we all have to work together.

883
01:10:36,722 --> 01:10:40,337
Just when I think I'm out,
they pull me back in!

884
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:44,303
Here's the plan. And I don't know why
I didn't think of this earlier.

885
01:10:44,475 --> 01:10:48,374
I could build a giant wooden chicken
and hide inside.

886
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:53,635
Then, under cover of night,
I'll jump out and I'II...

887
01:10:57,130 --> 01:10:58,592
Or I could just stay home.

888
01:10:58,763 --> 01:11:02,412
Knock it off, Reggie. Now, listen up.
Here's what we're gonna do.

889
01:11:04,497 --> 01:11:06,639
Listen, boy. I won this race...

890
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:10,770
...my daddy won it, his daddy won it,
all the way back to General Trenton...

891
01:11:10,937 --> 01:11:14,836
...who won the first Kentucky Open
100 years ago. You get my point?

892
01:11:15,006 --> 01:11:17,879
- I'll do my best, Dad.
- Yeah, well, good.

893
01:11:23,335 --> 01:11:25,061
You won't get away with this.

894
01:11:25,226 --> 01:11:28,545
Hush, now, little girl.
You're interfering with my Mozart.

895
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:30,694
I wonder if he was a Thoroughbred.

896
01:11:32,306 --> 01:11:34,445
- There's Sandy.
- And there's Sir Trenton...

897
01:11:34,613 --> 01:11:37,170
...all 1500 pounds of him.
We'll never get her out.

898
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:39,607
Oh, yes, we will.
We just need a diversion.

899
01:11:39,771 --> 01:11:42,108
I got your diversion right here.
Out of my way.

900
01:11:42,268 --> 01:11:43,645
Goose! Stick with the plan!

901
01:11:44,416 --> 01:11:46,141
Hey, moron! Up here!

902
01:11:46,563 --> 01:11:48,452
Never side against the family.

903
01:11:54,219 --> 01:11:56,425
Will you remind me again
why we brought him?

904
01:11:56,589 --> 01:11:59,888
- Hey, who killed the lights?
- How did you get in here?

905
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:03,502
Say your prayers, pelican.
Your lights are about to go out for good.

906
01:12:03,669 --> 01:12:06,989
- Can I get a little help here?
- Oh, great. There goes plan A.

907
01:12:07,161 --> 01:12:10,034
- Say hello...
- To plan B!

908
01:12:10,494 --> 01:12:13,399
Horse's booty at 12 o'clock.
Follow me, you're my wingman.

909
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:16,922
No way! You follow me! You are
my wingman! I am not your wingman!

910
01:12:17,093 --> 01:12:19,038
You're my "pull my wing" man!

911
01:12:19,208 --> 01:12:21,731
Whoa, dude.
A little trim wouldn't kill you!

912
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:29,299
What is that hideous racket?

913
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:32,944
Get back here! Come on,
I'll fight you with one wing behind my back.

914
01:12:33,111 --> 01:12:35,088
Nobody is allowed in my stables!

915
01:12:35,868 --> 01:12:37,877
I'll shut you up for good!

916
01:12:38,365 --> 01:12:41,020
Scuzz! You always get us in trouble.

917
01:12:41,856 --> 01:12:44,708
Hey, Trenton! Walk this way.

918
01:12:44,869 --> 01:12:46,464
- Break it down!
- What in the...?

919
01:12:46,631 --> 01:12:49,121
- This just ain't my speed here.
- You can do it.

920
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:52,939
- You're Superfly, son.
- All right, step back and watch me work.

921
01:12:55,377 --> 01:12:57,202
Turn this up, now!

922
01:12:57,364 --> 01:12:59,025
Say it like you mean it!

923
01:12:59,638 --> 01:13:01,101
Come on, now!

924
01:13:02,682 --> 01:13:04,507
What is going on here?

925
01:13:04,989 --> 01:13:07,513
- Tucker, get Sandy.
- You're the boss.

926
01:13:10,756 --> 01:13:12,186
What?

927
01:13:12,549 --> 01:13:15,041
- Come on, Sandy.
- Tucker! You old rail rat!

928
01:13:15,209 --> 01:13:17,316
- I might've known!
- Let's go! Quick!

929
01:13:17,579 --> 01:13:21,544
You and your animal freak show
have gotten in my way for the last time!

930
01:13:21,712 --> 01:13:25,032
- Those legs won't carry you far, Tucker!
- Hey! Wait for us!

931
01:13:30,425 --> 01:13:31,834
Where are they?

932
01:13:32,444 --> 01:13:35,743
- Come on.
- Stripes! Over here!

933
01:13:35,969 --> 01:13:37,628
Sandy!

934
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:39,425
Look out, he's coming!

935
01:13:48,944 --> 01:13:52,722
- I'm getting too old for this.
- You was born too old for this. Let's go!

936
01:13:55,095 --> 01:13:59,126
- You won't get away with this!
- Leave us alone, Sir Trenton.

937
01:13:59,292 --> 01:14:01,815
You and your foolish friends
accomplished nothing.

938
01:14:01,982 --> 01:14:04,952
The affections of a filly
do not make you a racehorse!

939
01:14:05,122 --> 01:14:08,421
You know something, Sir Trenton?
I don't want to be a racehorse.

940
01:14:08,582 --> 01:14:11,432
I'm a zebra.
And I'm going to the big race.

941
01:14:11,658 --> 01:14:14,148
- You fool.
- Come on, Tucker.

942
01:14:14,317 --> 01:14:17,387
- Let's go win ourselves a horserace.
- I like your attitude.

943
01:14:17,937 --> 01:14:21,170
You runts don't know
what you're in for.

944
01:14:21,781 --> 01:14:23,759
Well, he's nowhere south of the barn.

945
01:14:23,928 --> 01:14:26,516
He's not by the creek either.
What are we gonna do?

946
01:14:26,683 --> 01:14:29,752
We're gonna keep looking.
We'll start at the top of the hill.

947
01:14:29,919 --> 01:14:31,830
Well, let's go! We got a race to run.

948
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,393
Stripes is missing.
We don't know what happened.

949
01:14:34,565 --> 01:14:37,250
What are you talking about?
He looks okay to me.

950
01:14:39,818 --> 01:14:42,308
Chan, get him cleaned up
and loaded right now.

951
01:14:42,477 --> 01:14:43,908
You got it, coach.

952
01:14:50,102 --> 01:14:53,270
- It's the filly.
- It always is.

953
01:14:53,658 --> 01:14:55,548
Hey! Hey, she's from Philly.

954
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:59,389
I didn't know she was from Philly.
Man, I love those Philly cheesesteaks.

955
01:14:59,554 --> 01:15:03,814
Or any kind of cheese, really. Or any food
from anywhere. Especially candy and poop.

956
01:15:03,974 --> 01:15:06,530
- What were we talking about?
- I hate my life.

957
01:15:15,476 --> 01:15:17,867
Guys, I'm not gonna let Tucker
have all the fun.

958
01:15:18,039 --> 01:15:20,430
- There's no way I'm missing this.
- Hey, hold on!

959
01:15:20,762 --> 01:15:22,323
Wait for me!

960
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:26,683
This chicken is flying the coop!

961
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:31,772
Finally, some peace and quiet.
Y'all go ahead. Bye-bye, now.

962
01:15:31,941 --> 01:15:35,012
I'll just stay here and watch the palace.
For shizzle.

963
01:15:45,942 --> 01:15:47,799
Hang on a second. I just...

964
01:15:49,147 --> 01:15:52,281
I think your mom would've wanted
you to have that.

965
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:01,990
Dad...

966
01:16:03,338 --> 01:16:05,544
...I don't know what to say.

967
01:16:06,415 --> 01:16:08,872
Well, you were right.
You know, I've been...

968
01:16:09,683 --> 01:16:11,178
...scared since Mom died.

969
01:16:11,828 --> 01:16:13,839
You know, too scared to train horses...

970
01:16:14,936 --> 01:16:17,110
...too scared to let you grow up.

971
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:20,151
You forgive your old man?

972
01:16:21,536 --> 01:16:23,326
Daddy, you're not old.

973
01:16:28,296 --> 01:16:31,682
- Maybe a little gray.
- All right, well, let's get a move on.

974
01:16:55,046 --> 01:16:57,088
Riders, up!

975
01:16:57,610 --> 01:16:59,684
There you go. Okay, come on.

976
01:17:00,525 --> 01:17:02,948
Stay away from the rail, now.
Don't get boxed in.

977
01:17:09,239 --> 01:17:12,144
Ladies and gentlemen,
would you all please stand...

978
01:17:12,314 --> 01:17:15,416
...and join in singing the national anthem.

979
01:17:32,401 --> 01:17:35,405
When you're in the gate,
don't listen to the other racers.

980
01:17:35,573 --> 01:17:39,189
Let them do all the horsing around.
Save your energy for when it counts.

981
01:17:39,353 --> 01:17:42,837
Right. But, Tucker,
I do kind of feel sick to my stomach.

982
01:17:43,005 --> 01:17:45,180
Good. That means you're ready.

983
01:18:02,067 --> 01:18:04,656
This is Courtney Jones, KNN,
coming to you live...

984
01:18:04,822 --> 01:18:08,372
...from Turfway Park, where
horseracing history is about to be made.

985
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:10,909
- Can a zebra...?
- Sentimental favorite, Stripes...

986
01:18:11,069 --> 01:18:12,566
...can beat Trenton's Pride.

987
01:18:13,408 --> 01:18:15,648
He is trained by the legendary
Nolan Walsh...

988
01:18:15,812 --> 01:18:18,663
...who came out of retirement
specifically for this race.

989
01:18:18,823 --> 01:18:22,471
Stripes is ridden by the remarkable
16-year-old jockey, Channing Walsh.

990
01:18:22,636 --> 01:18:26,054
What could go down as extraordinary
in the history of horseracing...

991
01:18:26,225 --> 01:18:28,463
...is taking place at Turfway Park.

992
01:18:28,626 --> 01:18:32,820
Only a few short weeks ago, no one
had ever heard of Stripes, the racing zebra.

993
01:18:47,335 --> 01:18:48,831
Nolan.

994
01:18:49,226 --> 01:18:50,503
Clara.

995
01:18:50,796 --> 01:18:52,259
Beautiful day, huh?

996
01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:55,695
It would be if you weren't working
so hard to ruin my race day...

997
01:18:55,858 --> 01:18:58,249
...with that glorified donkey of yours.

998
01:18:59,382 --> 01:19:01,773
You're chipper
for someone who's about to lose.

999
01:19:01,945 --> 01:19:04,467
You wanna make this more interesting?
I mean...

1000
01:19:05,083 --> 01:19:07,770
- I'm listening.
- All right. I'll make you a deal.

1001
01:19:07,936 --> 01:19:11,103
My zebra wins, I get your filly,
the white jumper.

1002
01:19:11,492 --> 01:19:14,015
And your horse wins, I'II...

1003
01:19:15,913 --> 01:19:18,468
I'll give you the Walsh farm.

1004
01:19:18,796 --> 01:19:23,623
Nolan. My filly is worth twice as much
as your piece of land.

1005
01:19:24,434 --> 01:19:28,432
I tell you what. You lose,
and you come back to work for me.

1006
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:32,311
Lifetime contract, in writing.

1007
01:19:36,898 --> 01:19:38,525
Deal.

1008
01:19:39,907 --> 01:19:42,212
It'll be real nice
to have you back, Nolan.

1009
01:19:48,398 --> 01:19:51,850
All right, no speeches.
You all know what to do. Go get them.

1010
01:19:53,972 --> 01:19:56,114
There he is! Come on, Franny!

1011
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:02,940
You didn't think we'd let you
have all the glory to yourself.

1012
01:20:03,104 --> 01:20:05,112
Just like old times, Franny.

1013
01:20:17,744 --> 01:20:21,261
Ladies and gentlemen,
the starter has now called the roll.

1014
01:20:23,383 --> 01:20:26,256
The horses are approaching
the starting gate.

1015
01:20:48,564 --> 01:20:50,835
I'm gonna grind you into the track,
pony boy!

1016
01:20:51,574 --> 01:20:53,847
- You're pathetic!
- You're going down!

1017
01:20:54,171 --> 01:20:56,475
- Knock you out of the park!
- Gonna get trampled!

1018
01:20:56,861 --> 01:20:58,390
You're a joke!

1019
01:21:14,033 --> 01:21:15,310
They're all in.

1020
01:21:17,525 --> 01:21:21,720
And away they go. Marietta's Rock,
Pirate's Cove and Trenton's Pride...

1021
01:21:21,883 --> 01:21:24,535
...came away smartly,
with Jordan's Revenge...

1022
01:21:24,861 --> 01:21:27,101
- Ride, Stripes!
- Go! Come on, Stripes!

1023
01:21:27,264 --> 01:21:29,635
Ruffshodd keeping Stripes
tight on the rail...

1024
01:21:29,795 --> 01:21:33,214
...with Marc's A Mystery,
Flemish Fury and Brown-Nose-Biren.

1025
01:21:33,383 --> 01:21:37,479
As they head into the first corner,
Marietta's Rock's gone ahead to lead...

1026
01:21:37,868 --> 01:21:39,975
You're out of your league, freak!

1027
01:21:40,143 --> 01:21:42,217
You should've stuck
to racing the mailman.

1028
01:21:46,262 --> 01:21:49,397
- Tell Tucker Ruffshodd's got him boxed in!
- Copy that, Goose!

1029
01:21:49,563 --> 01:21:50,873
Ten-four! Roger Wilco!

1030
01:21:51,036 --> 01:21:55,230
Trenton's Pride is back in third.
Stripes is along the inside...

1031
01:21:55,394 --> 01:21:58,211
- Ruffshodd's boxed him in.
- Tell Stripes hug the rail...

1032
01:21:58,373 --> 01:22:01,278
...and make his move at the turn.
- Got it! Let's fly!

1033
01:22:01,704 --> 01:22:02,916
- Hey, Buzz?
- What?

1034
01:22:03,082 --> 01:22:05,670
Did you notice the irony
when you said, "Let's fly"?

1035
01:22:05,837 --> 01:22:08,142
- What are you talking about?
- I'm just asking.

1036
01:22:08,303 --> 01:22:11,723
Because we are flies and all.
Do you ever think about that stuff?

1037
01:22:11,893 --> 01:22:13,357
Would you shut up?

1038
01:22:13,526 --> 01:22:16,628
Tucker says to hug the rail
and make your move at the turn.

1039
01:22:16,793 --> 01:22:18,705
You're doing great!
You're doing great!

1040
01:22:18,876 --> 01:22:23,737
- Mistake. Miyuki's Magic is a long leader
outside, then comes Marc's A Mystery...

1041
01:22:30,538 --> 01:22:32,132
How does the rail taste?

1042
01:22:35,567 --> 01:22:37,456
You'll never see the finish line!

1043
01:22:38,483 --> 01:22:42,099
Ruffshodd's putting the Jersey
squeeze on him. That's a dirty trick!

1044
01:22:42,263 --> 01:22:45,300
Oh, not for long.
Time to take a bite out of crime.

1045
01:22:45,467 --> 01:22:47,476
Oh, I hate horse meat. Here goes.

1046
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:53,821
- coming out of the turn. And Ruffshodd
has inexplicably tossed his rider!

1047
01:22:55,366 --> 01:22:57,605
And Ruffshodd is out of the race!

1048
01:22:58,185 --> 01:23:00,096
- Marietta's Rock...
- That's my boy.

1049
01:23:00,268 --> 01:23:02,791
You've always been a pain in the butt.

1050
01:23:05,778 --> 01:23:09,677
They're down the back stretch.
Trenton's Pride is running the perfect race.

1051
01:23:09,846 --> 01:23:14,073
He's moving like an absolute winner.
Trenton's Pride, right up there in third spot.

1052
01:23:14,236 --> 01:23:18,496
The sentimental choice, Stripes, is coming
under pressure and starting to drop back.

1053
01:23:18,657 --> 01:23:21,824
- Stripes seems to be running out of steam.
- Had enough, boy?

1054
01:23:21,989 --> 01:23:26,117
Trenton's Pride is going strongly up
there amongst the leading line.

1055
01:23:26,281 --> 01:23:29,995
Three parts of the way through the race,
Marietta's Rock still in front...

1056
01:23:30,158 --> 01:23:33,937
...from Pirate's Cove, then Trenton's Pride
moving like a winner in third.

1057
01:23:34,099 --> 01:23:35,988
It was just too much to ask of him.

1058
01:23:36,149 --> 01:23:37,295
- in comes Miyuki's Magic.

1059
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:39,376
By a league is Pirate's Cove...

1060
01:23:39,545 --> 01:23:42,331
- I can't do it. I can't do it!
- Stripes is in the rear.

1061
01:23:43,709 --> 01:23:46,614
Oh, boy. Maybe I was wrong.
He might not have it.

1062
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:53,955
- The kid... The kid is wiped out.
- Yeah, he's falling back fast.

1063
01:23:54,122 --> 01:23:56,426
All right. Okay. One last shot.

1064
01:23:56,589 --> 01:24:01,231
You tell him if he believes he's not good
enough, he should stop trying. It's okay.

1065
01:24:01,555 --> 01:24:05,552
This is Superfly. We're proceeding
to the target. Do you copy, Scuzz?

1066
01:24:05,718 --> 01:24:09,552
Hey, I told you to use my code name,
Luke Scuzzwalker!

1067
01:24:13,889 --> 01:24:18,050
Kid, listen. Coach says that if you're
not good enough, you should stop trying.

1068
01:24:18,213 --> 01:24:21,032
- It's okay.
- You tell Tucker I've got a message for him!

1069
01:24:24,684 --> 01:24:29,907
Hey! Stripes said to tell you, "Don't
look back, leave it all on the track!"

1070
01:24:30,067 --> 01:24:32,656
Yes! That trick works every time!

1071
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:40,698
- Good boy! Go, Stripes! Let's go!
- Stripes is starting to get in on the inside.

1072
01:24:40,864 --> 01:24:43,769
Stripes is surging back into contention.

1073
01:24:43,939 --> 01:24:48,702
Trenton's Pride in front, but here comes
Stripes charging along the inside.

1074
01:24:48,873 --> 01:24:52,805
And Stripes is picking them off one by one,
he's coming at Trenton's Pride!

1075
01:24:52,974 --> 01:24:55,431
- Come on, Stripes!
- Stripes! Come on, Stripes!

1076
01:24:55,601 --> 01:24:57,391
Stripes is coming in around the inside.

1077
01:25:05,147 --> 01:25:07,289
- Come on, Channing!
- Come on, Channing!

1078
01:25:07,454 --> 01:25:09,661
These two are now locked together!

1079
01:25:09,825 --> 01:25:11,999
Stripes inside,
finding trouble on the rail.

1080
01:25:12,196 --> 01:25:15,745
Behind him, Trenton's Pride.
These two are head-to-head!

1081
01:25:15,912 --> 01:25:18,665
- Come on!
- Let him run!

1082
01:25:22,288 --> 01:25:25,674
They're head-to-head.
They're inside the final stages!

1083
01:25:25,842 --> 01:25:27,569
Stripes and Trenton's Pride...

1084
01:25:27,734 --> 01:25:30,224
- Come on! Yes, yes!
- Come on!

1085
01:25:30,392 --> 01:25:33,746
They're racing up towards the line.
Stripes along the inside.

1086
01:25:33,917 --> 01:25:36,090
- Let him run!
- Come on, Channing!

1087
01:25:36,255 --> 01:25:38,877
Come on! Come on! Run!
Move your butt! Come on!

1088
01:26:08,132 --> 01:26:10,076
- Way to go!
- Yeah!

1089
01:26:13,642 --> 01:26:14,953
Yeah!

1090
01:26:16,525 --> 01:26:18,120
That's my boy right there!

1091
01:26:18,289 --> 01:26:21,009
- Kentucky Open,
he's edged out Trenton's Pride...

1092
01:26:21,332 --> 01:26:25,165
...and Stripes is the winner
of the Kentucky Open...

1093
01:26:25,336 --> 01:26:29,530
...narrowly beating Trenton's Pride
in a driving finish.

1094
01:26:31,903 --> 01:26:34,775
I won. I can't believe I won!

1095
01:26:47,314 --> 01:26:49,138
That's my best boy.

1096
01:26:50,389 --> 01:26:53,327
Come on, hurry up!
We're going to the winner's circle!

1097
01:26:53,497 --> 01:26:55,921
This is his moment, guys. Come on.
He did it!

1098
01:27:04,614 --> 01:27:09,354
Did you see him, Dad? Did you see him?
He almost shot out from underneath me!

1099
01:27:12,143 --> 01:27:14,600
Your mom would be so proud.

1100
01:27:15,091 --> 01:27:16,685
And so am I.

1101
01:27:22,843 --> 01:27:25,562
- Hey, Stripey.
- Yeah?

1102
01:27:25,726 --> 01:27:29,406
My father was wrong about you.
You're a great racer.

1103
01:27:29,699 --> 01:27:33,216
Thanks! So are you.
We left it all on the track, didn't we?

1104
01:27:33,381 --> 01:27:36,070
Yeah. Yeah, I guess we did.

1105
01:27:36,522 --> 01:27:37,833
I'll see you at the fence?

1106
01:27:38,316 --> 01:27:40,359
Yeah. See you.

1107
01:27:46,966 --> 01:27:50,450
Great job. You make a lousy gangster,
but you're a stand-up pelican.

1108
01:27:50,619 --> 01:27:53,492
Listen, you mug, I...

1109
01:27:53,662 --> 01:27:57,178
Hey, that's the nicest thing
a very short horse ever said to me.

1110
01:27:57,923 --> 01:28:01,276
Then why don't you stick around here.
We make a pretty good team.

1111
01:28:01,446 --> 01:28:03,621
Now, that's an offer I can't refuse.

1112
01:28:03,786 --> 01:28:06,309
But first there's something
I gotta take care of.

1113
01:28:06,798 --> 01:28:09,451
I demand an inquiry!

1114
01:28:09,841 --> 01:28:11,730
- Do you hear me?
- Channing, over here!

1115
01:28:11,891 --> 01:28:14,479
That zebra was all over the field!

1116
01:28:15,416 --> 01:28:18,385
You listen to me,
I want that zebra disqualified!

1117
01:28:19,036 --> 01:28:22,684
Say hello to my little friend.

1118
01:28:23,233 --> 01:28:26,979
And I insist that you pay attention to...

1119
01:28:32,459 --> 01:28:33,922
To me.

1120
01:28:37,328 --> 01:28:39,273
If you'll excuse me.

1121
01:28:43,256 --> 01:28:45,647
I know how you feel, honey.
It happened to me.

1122
01:28:45,818 --> 01:28:50,745
All I can tell you is rinse, lather and repeat.
Rinse, lather and repeat!

1123
01:28:53,507 --> 01:28:57,669
Is there anybody special you'd like
to dedicate today's victory to?

1124
01:29:06,194 --> 01:29:08,617
Stripes! Stripes! Over here!

1125
01:29:10,518 --> 01:29:12,432
Where's he going?

1126
01:29:12,793 --> 01:29:15,448
Okay, Dean, get him.
Get the animals.

1127
01:29:15,613 --> 01:29:17,753
You should be in the winner's circle.

1128
01:29:17,919 --> 01:29:20,890
We both should be.
I'd be nothing without you.

1129
01:29:26,185 --> 01:29:29,766
- Thanks, kid.
- The roses make you look like Elvis.

1130
01:29:30,382 --> 01:29:33,068
Very Elvis. Very Elvis '75.

1131
01:29:33,329 --> 01:29:36,529
- I'm so proud of you, Stripes.
- Thanks, Sandy.

1132
01:29:37,366 --> 01:29:42,128
Coming through! Coming through!
Big winner! Coming through!

1133
01:29:51,557 --> 01:29:54,758
Yeah! Catch me, baby, catch me!
Get the good side!

1134
01:29:58,509 --> 01:30:00,169
Hey, boy.

1135
01:30:00,625 --> 01:30:02,993
- Say cheese!
- Big smile!

1136
