14
00:02:25,783 --> 00:02:26,943
Icarus.

15
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:29,509
<i>Yes, Dr. Searle?</i>

16
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:33,183
Please re-filter
the Observation Room portal.

17
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:36,991
<i>Filter up or down, Dr. Searle?</i>

18
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,295
Down.

19
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:45,305
Oh, my.

20
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:52,944
Icarus, how close is this to full brightness?

21
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:57,444
<i>At this distance of 36 million miles</i>

22
00:02:57,621 --> 00:03:02,354
<i>you are observing the sun
at 2 percent of full brightness.</i>

23
00:03:02,693 --> 00:03:03,751
Two percent?

24
00:03:05,194 --> 00:03:06,889
Can you show me 4 percent?

25
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:11,501
<i>Four percent would result in
irreversible damage to your retinas.</i>

26
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:22,110
<i>However, you could observe 3.1 percent,</i>

27
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:25,103
<i>for a period of not longer than 30 seconds.</i>

28
00:03:25,147 --> 00:03:28,082
All right. Icarus, I'm gonna reset

29
00:03:28,284 --> 00:03:32,381
the filter to 3.1 percent.

30
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:11,390
Well, it's invigorating.

31
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:14,400
It's like taking a shower in light.

32
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:17,629
You lose yourself a little.
Like a flotation tank.

33
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,463
Actually, no.

34
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:25,745
Look, what is it, beef?

35
00:04:25,915 --> 00:04:27,079
Chicken.

36
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:30,084
If you don't like it,
you take my shift next time.

37
00:04:30,086 --> 00:04:33,555
For psych tests on deep space,
I ran sensory-deprivation trials.

38
00:04:33,555 --> 00:04:35,990
Testing total darkness on flotation tanks.

39
00:04:36,158 --> 00:04:40,026
And the point about darkness is,
you float in it.

40
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,197
You and the darkness are
distinct from each other

41
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,295
because darkness is an absence
of something, it's a vacuum.

42
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,495
But total light, it envelops you.

43
00:04:50,673 --> 00:04:52,300
It becomes you.

44
00:04:54,843 --> 00:04:56,312
It's very strange. I don't...

45
00:04:57,512 --> 00:04:59,105
I recommend it.

46
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,814
What's strange, Searle,
is that you're the psych officer

47
00:05:01,838 --> 00:05:04,216
and I'm clearly a lot saner than you are.

48
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,713
Good.

49
00:05:23,172 --> 00:05:25,538
All right, if no one's gonna say it,
I'm going to.

50
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:30,042
The solar wind reading is much higher
than we'd anticipated at this distance.

51
00:05:30,211 --> 00:05:33,408
For the moment we can still send
package messages back.

52
00:05:33,615 --> 00:05:36,084
High-frequency bursts will rise
above interference

53
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,752
and the Moon Stations
will be able to pick them up.

54
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:44,555
But it's possible that within 24 hours
we won't be able to communicate at all.

55
00:05:44,726 --> 00:05:46,216
Possible?

56
00:05:47,362 --> 00:05:48,624
Probable.

57
00:05:51,238 --> 00:05:53,103
We'll finally be on our own.

58
00:05:53,274 --> 00:05:56,540
We're 55 million miles from Earth.
I'd say we're already on our own.

59
00:05:57,045 --> 00:05:59,877
Come on, guys.
We were expecting this.

60
00:06:00,048 --> 00:06:02,283
No great drama.
We're flying into the dead zone

61
00:06:02,283 --> 00:06:04,684
seven days sooner than we thought.

62
00:06:05,187 --> 00:06:08,555
But if any of you are planning
on sending a final message home...

63
00:06:09,591 --> 00:06:11,353
you should do it now.

64
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:24,266
Well, Mom and Dad.

65
00:06:26,475 --> 00:06:28,372
I hope you're proud of your son

66
00:06:28,944 --> 00:06:31,776
saving mankind and so on.

67
00:07:00,574 --> 00:07:04,543
By the time you get this message,
I'll be in the dead zone.

68
00:07:06,148 --> 00:07:08,709
It came a little sooner than we thought.

69
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,810
But this means that you won't be able
to send a message back.

70
00:07:14,456 --> 00:07:18,920
So I just wanted to let you know
that I don't need the message.

71
00:07:19,827 --> 00:07:23,786
Because I know everything
you wanna say.

72
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:37,644
Just remember it takes eight minutes
for light to travel from sun to Earth.

73
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:39,877
Which means you'll know we've succeeded

74
00:07:40,053 --> 00:07:43,319
about eight minutes
after we deliver the payload.

75
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,019
All you have to do is look out
for a little extra brightness in the sky.

76
00:07:48,196 --> 00:07:52,529
So, if you wake up one morning,
and it's a particularly beautiful day

77
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:54,691
you'll know we made it.

78
00:07:56,971 --> 00:07:58,562
Okay.

79
00:07:58,805 --> 00:08:00,670
I'm signing out.

80
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:04,007
And I'll see you in a couple of years.

81
00:08:52,058 --> 00:08:54,584
Icarus, dial it down a little, will you?

82
00:08:54,761 --> 00:08:57,025
<i>Yes, Corazon.</i>

83
00:09:01,936 --> 00:09:03,135
Captain?

84
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,868
Captain?

85
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,282
I'm guessing you've been talking to Searle.

86
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,115
So, do you have that report for me?
Yeah.

87
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,588
Right here.

88
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:25,096
The O2 productivity is good. In fact,
if anything, we're over-producing.

89
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,961
It will trail off dramatically
when we get nearer.

90
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:32,467
But in truth, we have the reserves
to make it there and a quarter-way back.

91
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:37,667
You're thinking about Icarus I.

92
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:42,504
Well, whatever it was
that tripped them up

93
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,652
I don't think it was a lack of oxygen.

94
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,615
Not on the outward journey, at any rate.

95
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,552
Fuck.

96
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,195
Fuck.

97
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,493
Mace.
Mace.

98
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:04,030
What are you doing?
Come on.

99
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,104
Fuck.
Relax. Put it down.

100
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,331
You son of a bitch.

101
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,302
Fucker took an hour in there.
Stop.

102
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,809
I can't send my package,
the wind is too high.

103
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,381
Calm down.
I'm sorry, all right? Jesus.

104
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:20,384
Kaneda, Searle, report to Flight Deck.

105
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:21,616
What's up?

106
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:26,115
We have an excess of manliness
breaking out in the Comms Center.

107
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,654
So how does this work?

108
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:34,059
Am I supposed to tell you
about my childhood?

109
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:37,361
I probably know more
about your childhood than you do.

110
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,568
It's the time.

111
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:50,246
Sixteen months,
you can get used to anything.

112
00:10:51,256 --> 00:10:52,724
You just

113
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:54,988
lose track.

114
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,559
I know I fucked up.

115
00:11:07,774 --> 00:11:09,336
From now on,

116
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,404
I'm not gonna lose track again.

117
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,879
Prescription.

118
00:11:17,283 --> 00:11:18,844
Earth Room.

119
00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:21,018
Two hours?

120
00:11:21,586 --> 00:11:23,187
And get a haircut, Mace.

121
00:11:24,111 --> 00:11:24,943
Yeah.

122
00:11:39,605 --> 00:11:40,798
Bring back the waves.

123
00:11:41,006 --> 00:11:44,875
<i>Dr. Searle's prescription specifies
a peaceful module.</i>

124
00:11:45,043 --> 00:11:46,705
The waves make me feel peaceful.

125
00:11:56,456 --> 00:11:58,219
Again.

126
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:18,937
Mace, I'm sorry.
I should have let you go first.

127
00:12:19,111 --> 00:12:21,845
Capa. It's me.
I'm the one apologizing, all right?

128
00:12:22,849 --> 00:12:24,206
All right.

129
00:12:29,956 --> 00:12:31,691
Was that the apology?
Yeah.

130
00:12:31,864 --> 00:12:33,498
Consider it accepted.
Okay.

131
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,120
<i>It was a sequence of contact reports
on the top-left shield quadrant</i>

132
00:13:03,861 --> 00:13:08,258
<i>which, by 1700, had turned
into a minor asteroid storm.</i>

133
00:13:08,634 --> 00:13:10,458
<i>None bigger than a raindrop,</i>

134
00:13:10,836 --> 00:13:13,229
<i>but we had 19 punctures and a</i>

135
00:13:13,453 --> 00:13:15,927
<i>secondary contact
to the engine compartment.</i>

136
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:18,803
<i>Took three alpha shifts to patch it up.</i>

137
00:13:18,976 --> 00:13:21,210
<i>Lost a little vapor. Nothing serious.</i>

138
00:13:22,313 --> 00:13:25,043
<i>I watched them hit us
from the Observation Room.</i>

139
00:13:25,517 --> 00:13:27,411
<i>Gotta tell you, Moon Base, it was...</i>

140
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:30,149
<i>It was...</i>

141
00:13:31,123 --> 00:13:32,750
<i>beautiful.</i>

142
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:36,119
<i>Gotta tell you, Moon Base, it was...</i>

143
00:13:37,696 --> 00:13:38,956
<i>It was...</i>

144
00:13:39,831 --> 00:13:41,663
<i>beautiful.</i>

145
00:13:57,883 --> 00:13:59,908
<i>Mace?</i>
Yeah.

146
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:03,053
<i>Your maintenance program
allows a further 14 minutes</i>

147
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:06,658
<i>for the mainframe panel
to remain out of coolant tank.</i>

148
00:14:08,192 --> 00:14:09,350
Shit.

149
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:35,951
Guys

150
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,792
you wanna see something?

151
00:14:41,065 --> 00:14:44,125
Well, I should have a few words to say

152
00:14:44,302 --> 00:14:45,567
but on reflection

153
00:14:46,336 --> 00:14:47,826
what can one say?

154
00:14:48,005 --> 00:14:49,801
Ladies and gentlemen.

155
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:52,232
Mercury.

156
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:32,976
23 hours ago, on making a routine
check on the comms systems...

157
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:34,745
While listening to your space music?

158
00:16:34,918 --> 00:16:38,254
While scanning the frequencies,
I heard a transmission.

159
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:42,552
It appeared as we flew
into the dark side of Mercury.

160
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:44,386
The iron content of the planet,

161
00:16:44,561 --> 00:16:45,926
is acting as an antenna.

162
00:16:46,096 --> 00:16:49,488
There's high background interference,
but the signal is clear enough.

163
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:53,567
Icarus, please play audio file 7-5/B.

164
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:55,129
<i>Yes, Harvey.</i>

165
00:17:12,423 --> 00:17:13,446
End file.

166
00:17:14,391 --> 00:17:15,751
What is it?

167
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,423
It's the Icarus I.

168
00:17:20,163 --> 00:17:22,132
That signal is their distress beacon.

169
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:23,395
Jesus.

170
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:25,826
That's impossible.
It's been seven years.

171
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:28,596
Clearly it's not impossible because
you can hear it with your own ears.

172
00:17:28,771 --> 00:17:30,803
Are you saying they're still alive?
We don't know.

173
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,582
But they could be. Their
oxygen is self-replenishing.

174
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,941
Water is recycled.

175
00:17:35,117 --> 00:17:36,914
They have the solar power they need.

176
00:17:37,086 --> 00:17:39,782
What about food? There's no way their
supplies could have lasted seven years.

177
00:17:39,955 --> 00:17:41,320
That depends.

178
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,118
They had stock to cover eight people
for three years.

179
00:17:44,294 --> 00:17:46,193
That's a four-year shortfall.
Hell of a diet.

180
00:17:46,395 --> 00:17:48,364
We don't know what happened
to Icarus I.

181
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,657
There might have been
an accident or something else.

182
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:53,028
There might not have been
eight people to feed.

183
00:17:53,202 --> 00:17:57,162
Captain, do we know where they are?
Well done, Capa. That is the question.

184
00:17:58,107 --> 00:17:59,739
Icarus.

185
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,971
Please plot our trajectory following
the slingshot around Mercury.

186
00:18:04,146 --> 00:18:05,914
<i>Yes, captain.</i>

187
00:18:08,518 --> 00:18:12,113
Now plot the source of the Icarus I beacon.

188
00:18:17,326 --> 00:18:19,295
Jesus. They almost made it.

189
00:18:19,461 --> 00:18:21,930
That's why no one picked up
the signal until now.

190
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:25,227
It was lost in the background light
and noise.

191
00:18:25,434 --> 00:18:26,902
We're gonna pass right by them.

192
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:30,403
Within 10 or 15 thousand miles.

193
00:18:30,573 --> 00:18:32,463
Can anyone survive?

194
00:18:32,741 --> 00:18:34,602
If the shield is intact.

195
00:18:35,644 --> 00:18:37,337
We'll be able to see them?

196
00:18:38,714 --> 00:18:40,079
Yes.

197
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,301
I'd need to look at all
of this pretty carefully.

198
00:18:43,027 --> 00:18:44,210
Very carefully.

199
00:18:44,354 --> 00:18:46,971
But if I had to make a guess right now,

200
00:18:47,395 --> 00:18:49,612
I'd say we could adjust our trajectory.

201
00:18:49,992 --> 00:18:51,482
We could fly straight to them.

202
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:53,219
But we're not gonna do that.

203
00:18:56,732 --> 00:19:00,269
Just to make it absolutely clear,
there's no way we're gonna do that.

204
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,964
Do I have to spell it out for you?

205
00:19:06,476 --> 00:19:09,411
We have a payload to deliver
to the heart of our nearest star.

206
00:19:09,578 --> 00:19:12,019
We're delivering that payload
because that star is dying.

207
00:19:12,188 --> 00:19:14,053
And if it dies, we die.

208
00:19:14,222 --> 00:19:15,554
Everything dies.

209
00:19:15,723 --> 00:19:17,520
So that is our mission.
There is nothing

210
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:21,459
literally nothing, more important than
completing our mission. End of story.

211
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,097
He's right.
He's right. Of course I'm right.

212
00:19:24,266 --> 00:19:26,564
Is anyone here seriously
considering otherwise?

213
00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:28,430
May I put a counter argument?
No.

214
00:19:28,604 --> 00:19:29,669
Captain?

215
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:31,265
Go ahead.

216
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,134
It would, of course

217
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:38,747
be absurd to alter our trajectory
to assist the crew of the Icarus I.

218
00:19:38,913 --> 00:19:42,280
Even if we knew that some or
even all of that crew are still alive

219
00:19:42,785 --> 00:19:47,813
their lives are entirely expendable when
seen in the context of our mission.

220
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,182
As are our own lives.

221
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:51,750
Exactly.
However

222
00:19:52,661 --> 00:19:56,252
there is something on board the
Icarus I that may be worth the detour.

223
00:19:56,332 --> 00:19:58,960
As you pointed out, Mace,
we have a payload to deliver.

224
00:19:59,134 --> 00:20:00,157
A payload. Singular.

225
00:20:00,336 --> 00:20:03,997
Now, everything about the delivery
and effectiveness of that payload

226
00:20:04,105 --> 00:20:06,631
is entirely theoretical.

227
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:08,470
Simply put,

228
00:20:08,644 --> 00:20:10,710
we don't know if it's gonna work.

229
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,411
But what we do know is this

230
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,946
if we had two bombs,
we'd have two chances.

231
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,987
You're assuming
we'd be able to pilot Icarus I.

232
00:20:21,155 --> 00:20:22,276
Yes.
Which is assuming

233
00:20:22,357 --> 00:20:24,480
that whatever stopped them
completing the mission

234
00:20:24,505 --> 00:20:26,842
wasn't a fault or a damage
to the spacecraft.

235
00:20:26,996 --> 00:20:28,963
Yes.
It's a lot of assumptions.

236
00:20:29,131 --> 00:20:30,154
It is.

237
00:20:30,332 --> 00:20:31,628
It's a risk assessment.

238
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:32,824
The question is:

239
00:20:33,001 --> 00:20:36,938
Does the risk of a detour outweigh
the benefits of an extra payload?

240
00:20:46,147 --> 00:20:47,479
We'll have a vote.
No, no.

241
00:20:47,982 --> 00:20:49,314
No, we won't.

242
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:52,152
We are not a democracy.

243
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:56,695
We're a collection of astronauts
and scientists.

244
00:20:56,865 --> 00:21:00,323
So we're gonna make the most
informed decision available to us.

245
00:21:00,501 --> 00:21:01,798
Made by you, by any chance?

246
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,166
Made by the person best qualified
to understand the complexities

247
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:07,307
of a payload delivery.

248
00:21:07,741 --> 00:21:09,209
Our physicist.

249
00:21:17,251 --> 00:21:18,679
Shit.

250
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:28,261
Okay, Icarus, run the math on the
successful delivery of the payload.

251
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,761
<i>Okay, payload delivery point reached.</i>

252
00:21:30,932 --> 00:21:32,057
Detach the payload.

253
00:21:32,634 --> 00:21:35,660
<i>Stellar bomb initiated and detached.</i>

254
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,270
<i>Crew and living section
have four minutes</i>

255
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,272
<i>to clear and commence
homeward journey.</i>

256
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:46,271
And four minutes after separation,
boosters automatically fire.

257
00:21:46,448 --> 00:21:51,214
<i>Payload boosters will automatically
fire after four-minute delay.</i>

258
00:21:51,385 --> 00:21:53,876
<i>Entering coronal hole
in South Polar Cap.</i>

259
00:21:54,055 --> 00:21:55,715
<i>Magnetic field structure open.</i>

260
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,450
<i>Temperature, 37,000.</i>

261
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:02,356
<i>Reliability of projection has dropped
below 45 percent.</i>

262
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:06,057
<i>Remaining projection is not open
to useful speculation.</i>

263
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:07,791
<i>Variables infinite.</i>

264
00:22:07,969 --> 00:22:09,299
<i>Accuracy unknown.</i>

265
00:22:09,471 --> 00:22:11,097
That's the problem right there.

266
00:22:11,271 --> 00:22:13,637
Between the boosters
and the gravity of the sun

267
00:22:13,807 --> 00:22:15,638
the velocity of the payload
will become so great

268
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:18,511
space and time will
become smeared together.

269
00:22:18,512 --> 00:22:21,340
Everything will distort,
everything will be unquantifiable.

270
00:22:21,615 --> 00:22:24,114
You have to come down on one side
or the other.

271
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:27,987
I need a decision.
It's not a decision, it's a guess.

272
00:22:28,923 --> 00:22:32,926
It's like flipping a coin and asking me
to decide whether it'll be heads or tails.

273
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:35,326
And?

274
00:22:36,737 --> 00:22:38,102
Heads.

275
00:22:43,109 --> 00:22:46,567
We've mined all Earth's fissile
materials for this bomb.

276
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,409
There's not gonna be another payload.

277
00:22:51,218 --> 00:22:54,016
The one we carry is our last chance.

278
00:22:54,221 --> 00:22:57,951
Our last best hope.

279
00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:03,619
Searle's argument is sound.

280
00:23:04,265 --> 00:23:06,232
Two last hopes are better than one.

281
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:09,736
That's it.

282
00:23:26,753 --> 00:23:28,346
<i>Slingshot complete.</i>

283
00:23:28,521 --> 00:23:31,650
<i>Icarus leaving Mercury orbit.</i>

284
00:23:59,987 --> 00:24:01,045
Hey.

285
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:03,053
Hey.

286
00:24:08,328 --> 00:24:10,092
Good dream?

287
00:24:11,238 --> 00:24:12,568
Let me guess.

288
00:24:12,905 --> 00:24:14,874
The surface of the sun?

289
00:24:16,876 --> 00:24:18,810
Only dream I ever have.

290
00:24:19,445 --> 00:24:22,744
Every time I shut my eyes
it's always the same.

291
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:27,045
Maybe you should talk
to Dr. Searle about that.

292
00:24:27,721 --> 00:24:30,315
See if he can help you out.

293
00:24:32,826 --> 00:24:34,555
Maybe.

294
00:24:38,064 --> 00:24:40,463
I just wanted to let you know,

295
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:43,592
I think you made the right decision.

296
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,837
Well.

297
00:24:48,474 --> 00:24:49,575
Mace doesn't,

298
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,299
and I'm guessing Harvey
and Trey don't either.

299
00:24:53,445 --> 00:24:54,512
Yeah...

300
00:24:55,347 --> 00:24:56,676
but I do.

301
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,049
Cassie, get the alarm.
What's going on?

302
00:25:25,075 --> 00:25:26,010
I screwed up.

303
00:25:26,011 --> 00:25:27,945
It's not you who screwed up.
It's my responsibility.

304
00:25:28,114 --> 00:25:30,344
We shouldn't be straying from the mission.
Trey, cut to it.

305
00:25:30,517 --> 00:25:33,952
In order to change the route,
I had to manually override Icarus.

306
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:37,782
So I made all the calculations myself.
And I double and triple-checked them.

307
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:39,152
They all worked out.

308
00:25:39,326 --> 00:25:42,295
So I set the new coordinates
and put us on our way.

309
00:25:42,461 --> 00:25:44,656
So what's the problem?
The trajectory is wrong?

310
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,093
The trajectory is good.

311
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,538
But it changes our angle of approach
to the sun by 1. 1 degrees.

312
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:53,907
You didn't reset the shields
to the new angle.

313
00:25:57,148 --> 00:25:59,480
Jesus Christ, Trey.

314
00:25:59,951 --> 00:26:01,817
I forgot.

315
00:26:04,656 --> 00:26:08,211
My head was full of velocities
and fuel calculations

316
00:26:08,237 --> 00:26:10,046
and a million different

317
00:26:10,096 --> 00:26:12,294
I fucked up, all right?

318
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:16,296
People do shit.

319
00:26:16,469 --> 00:26:18,198
They get stressed,

320
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,305
and fuck up.

321
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:23,035
I fucked up.

322
00:26:23,209 --> 00:26:24,539
Trey.

323
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:32,574
The fact is, we're still alive.

324
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:36,545
A hole hasn't burnt in the side of the ship.

325
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:38,848
We don't have a 10,000-degree climate.

326
00:26:38,924 --> 00:26:40,772
So, what's the actual damage?

327
00:26:40,897 --> 00:26:41,915
We don't know.

328
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,387
Icarus tried to reset the shields
independently when the alarm triggered.

329
00:26:45,765 --> 00:26:47,758
But all the sensors up there are
burned out.

330
00:26:48,034 --> 00:26:50,294
So we have no idea of the state
of the affected area.

331
00:26:51,537 --> 00:26:54,164
Only way we're gonna know
is if we go out there.

332
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,865
Okay.

333
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:59,173
I'll get suited up.

334
00:26:59,545 --> 00:27:01,244
It's a two-man job.

335
00:27:01,614 --> 00:27:04,208
As second in command,
you're not going anywhere.

336
00:27:04,383 --> 00:27:06,374
I volunteer.
No, I volunteer.

337
00:27:07,185 --> 00:27:08,278
Fine.

338
00:27:08,487 --> 00:27:10,013
I volunteer Capa.

339
00:27:14,926 --> 00:27:16,291
Sure.

340
00:27:16,494 --> 00:27:17,859
I'll do it.

341
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:21,190
Okay.

342
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,263
Okay.

343
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:30,731
You've done this a thousand times
in Earth-orbit training.

344
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:32,710
Yeah.

345
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:35,007
You're gonna be fine.

346
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,203
Okay?

347
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:49,817
Okay, Icarus.

348
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:51,986
I'm gonna be taking control for a while.

349
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:54,461
<i>Okay, Cassie.</i>
I'm gonna be cutting speed.

350
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:57,625
I'm gonna rotate us so the damage
is facing away from the sun.

351
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:00,134
Do we understand each other?
<i>Yes, Cassie.</i>

352
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:03,468
If you rotate by that much, we're gonna
lose comm towers three and four.

353
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:06,133
Well, it's a good thing
we don't need them, then.

354
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:09,007
We don't need them now,
we're gonna need them to go home.

355
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:11,211
We'll cross that bridge when
we come to it.

356
00:29:11,388 --> 00:29:15,018
In the meantime, I'm gonna try and
give them as much shadow as I can.

357
00:29:15,192 --> 00:29:16,353
All right, guys.

358
00:29:16,527 --> 00:29:18,256
I'm opening up.

359
00:29:50,528 --> 00:29:51,862
Okay.

360
00:29:58,035 --> 00:30:00,526
<i>Helmet-cam operational.</i>

361
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,468
<i>Affirmative. Good image.</i>

362
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:06,900
Capa, check,
helmet-cam fully operational.

363
00:30:07,077 --> 00:30:08,739
<i>Affirmative.</i>

364
00:30:12,616 --> 00:30:15,450
<i>Exiting airlock with maintenance
modules.</i>

365
00:30:29,634 --> 00:30:32,701
Moving down
to investigate damaged area.

366
00:30:34,337 --> 00:30:35,837
Okay, guys.

367
00:30:36,406 --> 00:30:38,102
Nice and easy.

368
00:30:39,076 --> 00:30:40,838
<i>Nice and easy.</i>

369
00:30:41,011 --> 00:30:42,275
<i>Copy.</i>

370
00:30:55,265 --> 00:30:58,290
<i>Icarus, please adjust shield
to allow for rotation.</i>

371
00:30:58,501 --> 00:30:59,828
<i>Yes, Cassie.</i>

372
00:31:28,832 --> 00:31:31,266
<i>Establishing new alignment to sun.</i>

373
00:31:33,869 --> 00:31:35,497
Jesus.

374
00:31:35,672 --> 00:31:37,798
That's the temperature change
on the shields.

375
00:31:37,974 --> 00:31:40,500
The metal's just contracting
and expanding.

376
00:31:40,676 --> 00:31:42,739
I know what it is, flyboy.

377
00:31:51,688 --> 00:31:54,221
It sounds like she's tearing apart.

378
00:32:15,746 --> 00:32:19,546
<i>Fatal damage to Comms Towers
3 and 4.</i>

379
00:32:19,715 --> 00:32:23,048
Copy, Icarus. Loss of towers
3 and 4. Cancel alarm.

380
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,782
Shut down sensor
to Comms Tower 3 and 4.

381
00:32:36,105 --> 00:32:39,131
<i>You should see it up here, guys.</i>

382
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,238
<i>It's pretty impressive.</i>

383
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,057
Okay.

384
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:58,594
There are four damaged panels.

385
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:04,499
They're about 300 meters out.

386
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:20,510
Capa, take it easy. You're going
through your O2 pretty fast.

387
00:33:22,317 --> 00:33:24,411
Copy that, Cory.

388
00:33:29,525 --> 00:33:31,755
That's it.
Slow down the breathing.

389
00:33:31,928 --> 00:33:33,919
Relaxed movement.

390
00:33:53,816 --> 00:33:56,182
<i>Approaching the first panel.</i>

391
00:34:18,981 --> 00:34:20,208
<i>We were lucky.</i>

392
00:34:20,382 --> 00:34:22,079
<i>Can you guys see this?</i>

393
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:23,909
<i>We can see it.</i>

394
00:34:24,085 --> 00:34:26,485
The hydraulics are burnt out.

395
00:34:26,655 --> 00:34:28,952
<i>Let's get this closed.</i>

396
00:34:50,478 --> 00:34:52,070
Okay, Mace.

397
00:34:52,847 --> 00:34:53,974
That's it.

398
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,181
<i>That's the first one closed.</i>

399
00:35:00,355 --> 00:35:01,947
You can do it?

400
00:35:02,123 --> 00:35:03,420
<i>It'll take a while, but...</i>

401
00:35:04,693 --> 00:35:05,853
Yeah.

402
00:35:07,128 --> 00:35:08,186
We can do it.

403
00:35:10,132 --> 00:35:11,597
Great job.

404
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:21,675
<i>Lots of smiling faces
in this room, guys.</i>

405
00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:23,777
<i>Great job.
I love you, captain.</i>

406
00:35:33,387 --> 00:35:35,351
<i>Moving to next panel.</i>

407
00:35:36,023 --> 00:35:37,820
Three to go.

408
00:35:58,318 --> 00:35:59,543
Hey.

409
00:36:01,422 --> 00:36:03,481
Don't kill yourself, man.
We got this, okay?

410
00:36:06,494 --> 00:36:07,755
What's going on, guys?

411
00:36:08,262 --> 00:36:09,422
The ship's moving.

412
00:36:09,597 --> 00:36:11,326
We' re venting O2. Shit.

413
00:36:11,498 --> 00:36:12,931
I think we're venting O2.

414
00:36:13,101 --> 00:36:15,065
<i>Resuming computer control
of Icarus II.</i>

415
00:36:15,135 --> 00:36:16,762
Negative, Icarus. Manual control.

416
00:36:16,938 --> 00:36:18,768
<i>Negative, Cassie. Computer control.</i>

417
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,431
<i>Returning vessel to original rotation.</i>
What?

418
00:36:21,608 --> 00:36:23,802
Icarus, override computer
to manual control.

419
00:36:23,878 --> 00:36:25,539
<i>Negative. Mission in jeopardy.</i>

420
00:36:25,713 --> 00:36:28,681
<i>Override command statement to
manual flight controls removed.</i>

421
00:36:28,849 --> 00:36:30,181
Why?
Negative, Icarus.

422
00:36:30,351 --> 00:36:32,012
Negative. State reason immediately.

423
00:36:32,186 --> 00:36:34,619
<i>Fire in oxygen garden.</i>

424
00:36:39,594 --> 00:36:40,856
No.

425
00:36:43,697 --> 00:36:44,722
Seal oxygen feed.

426
00:36:44,898 --> 00:36:47,867
Fireguard perimeter.
Sealing sector. Sealing feed.

427
00:36:50,405 --> 00:36:53,340
Seal sections five through nine.
Sealing five through nine.

428
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,536
Kaneda, Capa,
get back to the airlock now.

429
00:36:58,713 --> 00:37:00,112
Can't.

430
00:37:01,382 --> 00:37:03,815
<i>Can't leave upright panels.</i>

431
00:37:04,351 --> 00:37:07,219
The ship will burn up if the shields
are not repaired.

432
00:37:07,387 --> 00:37:08,719
They're gonna die.
Don't.

433
00:37:08,889 --> 00:37:10,585
They're gonna burn.
They are not.

434
00:37:10,757 --> 00:37:12,349
<i>Override Icarus. Cassie, pilot</i>

Mace?

439
00:37:21,268 --> 00:37:22,429
Mace?

440
00:37:22,637 --> 00:37:23,661
Wait, Cassie.

441
00:37:26,373 --> 00:37:27,704
Jesus Christ, Harvey.

442
00:37:28,543 --> 00:37:31,416
Harvey, comms officer,

<i>Manual control returned.</i>

445
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:36,282
No.

446
00:37:36,856 --> 00:37:38,255
Icarus, continue procedure.

447
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:40,150
What?

448
00:37:40,728 --> 00:37:41,887
<i>Captain.</i>

449
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:45,061
Back me up.
<i>Copy, Mace.</i>

450
00:37:45,231 --> 00:37:47,597
<i>Crew priority
is to protect the payload.</i>

451
00:37:48,202 --> 00:37:49,635
<i>Get the fire out.</i>

452
00:37:49,802 --> 00:37:52,202
<i>Icarus, take control of the ship.</i>

453
00:37:52,806 --> 00:37:55,536
<i>Affirmative, captain.</i>
Damn it.

454
00:37:58,077 --> 00:38:01,077
<i>Returning vessel to original rotation.</i>

455
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,594
Let me in. Please.
<i>Negative.</i>

456
00:38:18,766 --> 00:38:21,199
<i>Door sealed by operating superior
comms officer.</i>

457
00:38:21,568 --> 00:38:22,967
You motherfucker.

458
00:38:23,137 --> 00:38:24,262
Let me in.

459
00:38:26,806 --> 00:38:28,934
<i>Hazard diagnostic complete.</i>

460
00:38:29,108 --> 00:38:30,838
<i>Sprinkler system failing.</i>

461
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:33,309
<i>Fire will burn for six hours.</i>

462
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,777
<i>Sixty percent chance
of containment failure.</i>

463
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:40,010
<i>Seventy-five percent chance of collateral
damage to life-support systems.</i>

464
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:42,210
What are we gonna do?

465
00:38:43,257 --> 00:38:45,121
Flood it with O2.
What?

466
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:47,657
It'll cause a flash over.
Make it burn itself out.

467
00:38:47,827 --> 00:38:49,420
We'll lose the whole garden.

468
00:38:49,596 --> 00:38:50,619
We already lost it.

469
00:38:51,465 --> 00:38:53,159
<i>Jesus, Mace, I don't know.</i>

470
00:38:53,634 --> 00:38:55,534
Icarus, open the O2 tanks.

471
00:38:55,735 --> 00:38:57,327
<i>Cory, get the hell out of there.</i>

472
00:38:57,503 --> 00:38:59,130
<i>Opening O2 tanks.</i>

473
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:05,039
No.

474
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,030
<i>Eighty-nine percent of shield
in full sunlight.</i>

475
00:39:43,523 --> 00:39:45,619
<i>Capa, go back.</i>

476
00:39:46,492 --> 00:39:48,293
<i>I'll finish this.</i>

477
00:39:48,561 --> 00:39:49,784
Please, I can do this.

478
00:39:52,331 --> 00:39:53,489
Go.

479
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:04,409
Capa returning to airlock.

480
00:40:04,577 --> 00:40:05,942
Do you copy?

481
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:11,242
Capa returning to airlock.
Do you copy?

482
00:40:11,416 --> 00:40:14,181
<i>Copy, Capa. Hurry.</i>

483
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:19,083
<i>Ninety-one percent of shield
in full sunlight.</i>

484
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:47,213
<i>Ninety-four percent of shield
in full sunlight.</i>

485
00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:56,766
Captain? Captain?
I'm at the edge of the shield.

486
00:40:57,268 --> 00:40:58,860
<i>Do you copy?</i>

487
00:40:59,304 --> 00:41:01,773
Captain, you must leave now.
Captain?

488
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:05,239
<i>Ninety-seven percent of shield
in full sunlight.</i>

489
00:41:05,411 --> 00:41:08,471
<i>Final panel closing.
The shield is secure.</i>

490
00:41:08,646 --> 00:41:09,978
You have to move now.

491
00:41:10,148 --> 00:41:12,639
<i>Captain, it's right on you.</i>

492
00:41:12,818 --> 00:41:15,342
Kaneda's not gonna make it.
You have to move.

493
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:17,489
You have to move now.

494
00:41:17,655 --> 00:41:18,748
It's too far.

495
00:41:20,259 --> 00:41:22,385
Captain, move.

496
00:41:23,963 --> 00:41:25,487
<i>Why isn't he moving?</i>

497
00:41:26,465 --> 00:41:27,625
Kaneda.

498
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,358
What do you see?

499
00:41:29,534 --> 00:41:31,867
Searle, tell our captain to move.

500
00:41:32,036 --> 00:41:35,130
<i>Kaneda, what can you see?</i>

501
00:41:35,306 --> 00:41:37,103
<i>Searle, do you copy?</i>

502
00:41:53,157 --> 00:41:54,420
Kaneda?

503
00:42:25,523 --> 00:42:28,356
<i>Shield rotation complete.</i>

504
00:42:54,425 --> 00:42:56,393
The breakdown is as follows.

505
00:42:56,561 --> 00:42:58,391
Trey is sedated in the Med Center.

506
00:42:58,563 --> 00:43:01,224
Dr. Searle has diagnosed him
as a suicide risk.

507
00:43:02,766 --> 00:43:05,702
I don't think any of us
are about to question that diagnosis.

508
00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:09,635
As second in command,
I am now the captain of Icarus II.

509
00:43:09,807 --> 00:43:12,139
Thanks both to Kaneda

510
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:15,369
and Capa, our shields are intact.

511
00:43:15,547 --> 00:43:17,610
As is the payload.

512
00:43:18,315 --> 00:43:21,751
But the oxygen garden
is totally destroyed.

513
00:43:22,219 --> 00:43:26,088
In addition, a large amount of O2
was burned in the fire.

514
00:43:26,391 --> 00:43:27,824
As it stands now

515
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,590
we don't have enough oxygen reserves
to get us to our payload delivery point.

516
00:43:35,266 --> 00:43:37,597
Let alone to survive the return journey.

517
00:43:37,768 --> 00:43:40,302
So cancel the ticker-tape parade.

518
00:43:43,942 --> 00:43:48,038
We now have no choice
but to rendezvous with Icarus I.

519
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,414
If we're gonna complete
the mission.

520
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:54,079
The Icarus I is our only hope.

521
00:44:06,364 --> 00:44:08,992
Technically, he made a mistake.

522
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:10,764
What are you trying to say, Cory?

523
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,603
Harvey said there's not enough oxygen
to get us to the delivery point.

524
00:44:14,778 --> 00:44:16,503
But there is.

525
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:21,710
There just isn't enough oxygen
to get all of us there.

526
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:25,282
Are you suggesting
we let Trey kill himself?

527
00:44:25,456 --> 00:44:26,514
No.

528
00:44:28,092 --> 00:44:29,818
And in any case

529
00:44:30,728 --> 00:44:33,219
Trey wouldn't be enough.

530
00:44:34,331 --> 00:44:36,628
We need to lose two more.

531
00:44:42,106 --> 00:44:45,199
Three out of seven.
That's a lot of short straws.

532
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:28,847
Capa, it's me.

533
00:45:34,425 --> 00:45:36,016
It's different.

534
00:45:36,193 --> 00:45:39,356
Being afraid
that you won't make it back home.

535
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:43,726
And then knowing that you won't.

536
00:45:45,402 --> 00:45:48,393
Our survival depends
on what we can salvage from Icarus I.

537
00:45:48,572 --> 00:45:50,096
No.

538
00:45:51,481 --> 00:45:52,708
We're gonna die out here.

539
00:45:53,682 --> 00:45:55,809
Like the other crew.

540
00:45:56,219 --> 00:45:57,947
I know it.

541
00:45:59,989 --> 00:46:01,485
So do you.

542
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:06,387
Are you scared?

543
00:46:15,438 --> 00:46:17,496
When the stellar bomb is triggered

544
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:21,302
very little will happen at first.

545
00:46:21,644 --> 00:46:24,670
And then a spark
will pop into existence

546
00:46:24,847 --> 00:46:28,715
and it will hang for an instant,
hovering in space. And then...

547
00:46:30,152 --> 00:46:32,143
it will split into two.

548
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:34,016
And those will split again,

549
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:36,088
and again and again.

550
00:46:40,362 --> 00:46:42,456
Detonation beyond all imagining.

551
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:46,094
A big bang on a small scale.

552
00:46:46,268 --> 00:46:48,237
A new star born out of a dying one.

553
00:46:50,472 --> 00:46:52,599
I think it'll be beautiful.

554
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:55,735
No. I'm not scared.

555
00:47:00,849 --> 00:47:02,442
I am.

556
00:47:51,072 --> 00:47:53,666
<i>Searle, Capa, they're waiting for you.</i>

557
00:47:53,842 --> 00:47:55,867
Okay, let's go.

558
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:45,016
Be careful, watch your step.

559
00:49:49,431 --> 00:49:51,456
Cassie, are you getting this
on the feed?

560
00:49:51,632 --> 00:49:52,922
Getting what?

561
00:49:53,668 --> 00:49:56,967
The air. It's full of dust.

562
00:49:57,139 --> 00:49:58,800
Human skin.

563
00:49:58,974 --> 00:50:00,065
What?

564
00:50:00,242 --> 00:50:03,206
Eighty percent of all dust
is human skin.

565
00:50:08,449 --> 00:50:10,144
Sorry.

566
00:50:14,755 --> 00:50:16,188
No lights?
No.

567
00:50:16,358 --> 00:50:17,585
No surprise.

568
00:50:19,094 --> 00:50:21,561
Anyone afraid of the dark?

569
00:50:22,463 --> 00:50:23,487
We should split up.

570
00:50:23,664 --> 00:50:26,259
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

571
00:50:26,768 --> 00:50:28,099
Yeah, probably right.

572
00:50:28,269 --> 00:50:31,432
Might get picked off one at a time
by aliens.

573
00:50:31,606 --> 00:50:35,041
Icarus I is a big ship. We can't search it
effectively in one group.

574
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:37,610
Okay. You're right.

575
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:42,177
Mace, head up for the Flight Deck,
see if you can't get her to fly.

576
00:50:44,085 --> 00:50:46,849
Searle, check the social area
and the sleeping quarters.

577
00:50:47,021 --> 00:50:48,887
Capa, aim for the payload.

578
00:50:50,431 --> 00:50:52,626
I'll check the garden.

579
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,527
Let's keep in contact, guys.

580
00:51:33,306 --> 00:51:35,672
Listen up, everybody.

581
00:51:36,277 --> 00:51:39,905
You gotta see this.
Seven years of unchecked growth.

582
00:51:41,481 --> 00:51:43,472
Can you see this?

583
00:51:43,784 --> 00:51:46,911
It's an ecosystem working beautifully
after all this time.

584
00:51:47,088 --> 00:51:49,318
You seeing this readout,
O2, everybody.

585
00:51:50,257 --> 00:51:51,282
It's wonderful.

586
00:51:51,759 --> 00:51:52,782
Oh, my God.

587
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,860
Cory, look at the ferns.

588
00:52:10,978 --> 00:52:13,139
That's strange.

589
00:52:13,581 --> 00:52:16,141
Subsystems are fine.
Solar harvest is fine.

590
00:52:16,317 --> 00:52:20,219
The ship should be running except I'm
getting nothing from the flight computer.

591
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:28,286
Got water.

592
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:33,528
Food.

593
00:52:39,913 --> 00:52:41,641
No crew.

594
00:52:42,248 --> 00:52:43,375
No bodies.

595
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:52,822
My God.

596
00:52:53,893 --> 00:52:56,327
You can hardly walk, it's so thick.

597
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,992
<i>I am Pinbacker.</i>

598
00:53:04,905 --> 00:53:07,202
<i>Commander of the Icarus I.</i>

599
00:53:10,943 --> 00:53:13,708
<i>We have abandoned our mission.</i>

600
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,679
<i>Our star is dying.</i>

601
00:53:19,219 --> 00:53:21,710
<i>All our science,</i>

602
00:53:23,255 --> 00:53:25,519
<i>all our hopes,</i>

603
00:53:26,927 --> 00:53:30,521
<i>our dreams, are foolish.</i>

604
00:53:31,297 --> 00:53:33,561
<i>In the face of this...</i>

605
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,096
<i>we are...</i>

606
00:53:36,869 --> 00:53:40,567
<i>dust. Nothing more.</i>

607
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:45,943
<i>And to this dust, we will return.</i>

608
00:53:49,215 --> 00:53:55,085
<i>When he chooses for us to die.</i>

609
00:53:55,255 --> 00:53:57,485
<i>It is not our place,</i>

610
00:53:58,492 --> 00:54:01,255
<i>to challenge God.</i>

611
00:54:05,231 --> 00:54:07,132
Okay, that make sense to anyone?

612
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:10,764
Transmission code is six
and a half years ago.

613
00:54:12,844 --> 00:54:15,244
That would be after they entered
the non-com zone.

614
00:54:16,215 --> 00:54:19,411
That should be the time they
were supposed to deliver the payload.

615
00:54:36,235 --> 00:54:38,795
<i>Payload is fully operational.</i>

616
00:54:38,971 --> 00:54:40,164
Say again, Capa?

617
00:54:40,338 --> 00:54:43,034
The payload is fully operational.
It's A-okay.

618
00:54:45,043 --> 00:54:48,012
That's great news.
Looks like we got what we came for.

619
00:54:48,181 --> 00:54:49,608
No, we don't.

620
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:51,539
<i>Go ahead, Mace?</i>

621
00:54:51,751 --> 00:54:54,184
I know what caused
the distress signal.

622
00:54:54,653 --> 00:54:57,885
<i>There's a coolant failure of some kind.
The bottom line is...</i>

623
00:54:58,056 --> 00:55:00,958
<i>it doesn't matter that Capa
has his payload.</i>

624
00:55:01,126 --> 00:55:03,561
<i>Without the mainframe, we can't fly.</i>

625
00:55:04,963 --> 00:55:07,159
<i>It's been sabotaged.</i>

626
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:12,800
We should never have
gone off the mission.

627
00:55:30,856 --> 00:55:32,717
I have something to say.

628
00:55:34,827 --> 00:55:35,885
Found the crew.

629
00:55:57,456 --> 00:55:58,918
What happened?

630
00:56:01,092 --> 00:56:02,684
They had an epiphany.

631
00:56:03,695 --> 00:56:04,753
They saw the light.

632
00:56:05,864 --> 00:56:07,855
They burned themselves.

633
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:09,364
No shit.

634
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:12,902
I suspect the observation filter
is fully open.

635
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:18,373
If we weren't behind the screen
of Icarus II, we'd join them.

636
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,342
Ashes to ashes.

637
00:56:22,614 --> 00:56:24,706
Stardust to stardust.

638
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:26,708
Icarus!

639
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:33,581
Icarus. Stabilizers.

640
00:56:39,998 --> 00:56:42,898
What was that?
Guys, get back to the airlock, now.

641
00:56:48,306 --> 00:56:49,934
<i>We have a major incident.</i>

642
00:56:50,108 --> 00:56:51,905
<i>We are floating free from you.</i>

643
00:56:52,077 --> 00:56:53,806
<i>Repeat, we are floating free.</i>

644
00:56:54,512 --> 00:56:55,911
<i>All crew back to the airlock.</i>

645
00:57:08,393 --> 00:57:10,019
Cassie.
<i>The airlock has decoupled.</i>

646
00:57:10,195 --> 00:57:11,753
<i>We don't know why.</i>

647
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:14,592
<i>The locking system on Icarus I
is totally ripped open.</i>

648
00:57:14,766 --> 00:57:15,862
<i>I can hold our position,</i>

649
00:57:15,887 --> 00:57:17,987
but we aren't gonna
be able to dock again.

650
00:57:18,135 --> 00:57:19,467
<i>There's another thing, guys.</i>

651
00:57:19,637 --> 00:57:22,505
<i>You've got a breach, I can see it.
You're losing atmosphere.</i>

652
00:57:23,275 --> 00:57:24,298
We're screwed.

653
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:26,333
No, we're not.

654
00:57:32,856 --> 00:57:34,414
One of us isn't, anyway.

655
00:57:52,643 --> 00:57:53,668
What happened?

656
00:57:53,844 --> 00:57:56,836
Airlock's destroyed.
There's only one suit. Capa's taking it.

657
00:58:05,389 --> 00:58:07,824
Why Capa?
The rest of us are lower priority.

658
00:58:07,992 --> 00:58:09,391
I'm not a low priority.

659
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:12,393
You're a comms officer on a ship
that has no communication.

660
00:58:12,563 --> 00:58:13,722
I am the captain.

661
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,963
The mission needs a captain
to hold it together.

662
00:58:18,235 --> 00:58:22,070
Harvey, Capa's the only person outside
of Icarus who can operate the payload.

663
00:58:22,572 --> 00:58:23,664
There is no choice.

664
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,364
No, there's no choice for you.

665
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:28,376
Capa, I order you to remove that suit.

666
00:58:31,715 --> 00:58:33,581
Get out of the suit.

667
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,913
That is a direct order.

668
00:58:42,626 --> 00:58:47,393
I assure you, when I'm on board Icarus II
that I'll do everything within my power

669
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:50,125
To what?
Shuttle back with more suits?

670
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:51,858
The airlock is ripped in half.

671
00:58:52,036 --> 00:58:55,733
Once we break that seal,
how are we gonna re-pressurize?

672
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:03,480
Cassie.

673
00:59:04,614 --> 00:59:06,047
Go.

674
00:59:06,217 --> 00:59:09,208
Listen. We can't depressurize
when we open the airlock.

675
00:59:09,387 --> 00:59:12,260
So the force of the gas
is gonna fire him out, right?

676
00:59:12,795 --> 00:59:13,820
Right.

677
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:17,329
If you open your airlock and
we line it up right, he'll fire inside.

678
00:59:19,268 --> 00:59:20,293
And so will we.

679
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:24,664
Without suits?

680
00:59:26,242 --> 00:59:28,972
Get as close as you can.
You ' II have 20 meters to cover.

681
00:59:29,146 --> 00:59:31,773
At minus 273 degrees Celsius.

682
00:59:33,916 --> 00:59:35,748
It's gonna be cold.

683
00:59:36,186 --> 00:59:38,085
But we'll make it.

684
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:42,286
Anyone got any better ideas?

685
00:59:47,498 --> 00:59:48,829
Copy that.

686
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:07,010
Mace.

687
01:00:07,583 --> 01:00:09,248
One problem.

688
01:00:09,987 --> 01:00:11,954
The computer's down.

689
01:00:12,121 --> 01:00:15,682
One of us has to manually
operate the seal.

690
01:00:15,992 --> 01:00:17,858
From inside.

691
01:00:18,896 --> 01:00:21,023
Shit.

692
01:00:23,233 --> 01:00:25,030
You're right.

693
01:00:25,202 --> 01:00:28,329
So, whatever happens,
one of us is staying behind.

694
01:00:31,842 --> 01:00:34,367
I see. I get it.

695
01:00:34,545 --> 01:00:37,878
It's me.
That's what you're all thinking?

696
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:42,041
No, Harvey.

697
01:00:42,219 --> 01:00:43,242
It's me.

698
01:01:04,179 --> 01:01:05,704
You okay?

699
01:01:07,182 --> 01:01:08,574
Hey, Capa.

700
01:01:09,184 --> 01:01:10,777
We're only stardust.

701
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:25,927
<i>Mace, we're lined up.</i>

702
01:01:26,101 --> 01:01:28,228
<i>Everything's set.</i>

703
01:01:33,208 --> 01:01:34,800
Searle, are you ready?

704
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:40,873
All right.
We only got one shot at this.

705
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:42,074
<i>Cassie.</i>

706
01:01:42,684 --> 01:01:44,481
<i>Are you ready?</i>
Ready.

707
01:01:44,686 --> 01:01:48,384
Harvey, keep your eyes shut
and exhale slowly.

708
01:01:48,557 --> 01:01:49,684
Copy.

709
01:01:53,829 --> 01:01:55,297
Let's do it.

710
01:02:42,117 --> 01:02:43,777
<i>Crew detected in airlock.</i>

711
01:02:44,253 --> 01:02:46,483
<i>Recommend sealing
outer airlock door.</i>

712
01:02:46,655 --> 01:02:49,215
<i>I lost Harvey. I lost Harvey.</i>

713
01:02:49,391 --> 01:02:51,882
<i>Harvey's gone.
Crew detected in airlock.</i>

714
01:02:52,628 --> 01:02:54,822
<i>Sealing outer airlock door.</i>

715
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,398
Breathe, Mace. Just breathe.

716
01:03:32,568 --> 01:03:33,728
Get my hand. Get my hand.

717
01:03:33,902 --> 01:03:35,335
Breathe, Mace.
Capa?

718
01:03:35,503 --> 01:03:38,336
You ' re okay, Mace. You're okay, Mace.
Please, breathe.

719
01:03:56,692 --> 01:04:00,059
Capa, are you all right?
Yeah. Yeah.

720
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:03,530
Let's get you out of here.

721
01:04:45,914 --> 01:04:47,409
<i>Searle?</i>

722
01:04:48,416 --> 01:04:49,847
<i>We're leaving now.</i>

723
01:04:54,588 --> 01:04:56,784
<i>We're gonna complete the mission.</i>

724
01:04:58,592 --> 01:05:00,788
<i>We're all thinking of you, Searle.</i>

725
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:03,188
<i>Searle?</i>

726
01:05:04,264 --> 01:05:06,164
<i>We're gonna go now.</i>

727
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,034
<i>We love you.</i>

728
01:05:41,302 --> 01:05:43,862
I've been through Icarus's activity file
and I checked it.

729
01:05:44,038 --> 01:05:46,199
Double-checked it.
Cory triple-checked it.

730
01:05:46,373 --> 01:05:48,739
And it's the same results.

731
01:05:49,811 --> 01:05:53,514
In other words, unless Icarus is deleting
her own files, she didn't do it.

732
01:05:53,686 --> 01:05:56,815
And there was no malfunction
on the airlock hardware.

733
01:05:56,990 --> 01:06:00,449
Which means the airlock
was decoupled manually.

734
01:06:01,528 --> 01:06:03,724
Cassie and I were on the Flight Deck.

735
01:06:03,898 --> 01:06:05,889
And I was with Capa and Searle.

736
01:06:06,367 --> 01:06:09,893
And I think we can all assume
it wasn't Harvey.

737
01:06:10,371 --> 01:06:12,702
Which leaves one possibility.

738
01:06:14,275 --> 01:06:15,333
Trey.

739
01:06:15,509 --> 01:06:18,170
Trey is so doped up
he can hardly walk or feed himself.

740
01:06:18,344 --> 01:06:19,916
He sleeps for 23 hours a day,

741
01:06:19,916 --> 01:06:22,166
and he blames himself for
everything that's gone wrong.

742
01:06:22,215 --> 01:06:23,773
Why would he do it?
We don't know.

743
01:06:23,983 --> 01:06:27,715
But the possibility remains that it was
him and we gotta take that seriously.

744
01:06:27,788 --> 01:06:29,318
By doping him up more?
This...

745
01:06:29,889 --> 01:06:34,452
This isn't just about the possibility
whether he sabotaged the airlock hardware.

746
01:06:34,628 --> 01:06:36,592
There is something else too.

747
01:06:40,067 --> 01:06:44,295
When Searle and Harvey died,
we lost two breathers.

748
01:06:45,371 --> 01:06:47,362
If Trey dies

749
01:06:48,409 --> 01:06:51,809
we'll have the oxygen
to make it to the delivery point.

750
01:06:52,012 --> 01:06:54,206
At least now we know what happened
on Icarus I.

751
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:57,646
The same thing that's happening here.
Fuck you, Capa.

752
01:06:57,818 --> 01:07:01,014
What are you trying to remind us of?
Our lost humanity?

753
01:07:06,393 --> 01:07:07,416
I'll do it.

754
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:11,164
I'm not passing any bucks.

755
01:07:11,898 --> 01:07:13,661
Do it how?

756
01:07:15,235 --> 01:07:17,197
That's between me and Trey.

757
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,074
We'll have a vote this time.
Unanimous decision required.

758
01:07:24,077 --> 01:07:26,739
So you know where I stand.

759
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:34,983
And me.

760
01:07:38,431 --> 01:07:40,030
What are you asking?

761
01:07:41,001 --> 01:07:44,164
That we weigh the life of one
against the future of mankind?

762
01:07:48,942 --> 01:07:50,204
Kill him.

763
01:07:50,943 --> 01:07:52,202
Cassie?

764
01:07:56,516 --> 01:07:57,606
No.

765
01:08:01,487 --> 01:08:04,251
Cassie.
I know the argument.

766
01:08:04,824 --> 01:08:06,682
I know the logic.

767
01:08:07,827 --> 01:08:09,818
You're saying you need my vote.

768
01:08:09,996 --> 01:08:12,487
I'm saying you can't have it.

769
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:22,971
What do we do?

770
01:08:29,248 --> 01:08:31,376
Oh, God.

771
01:08:33,185 --> 01:08:34,914
I'm sorry, Cassie.

772
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:43,251
You make it easy for him.

773
01:08:44,698 --> 01:08:46,127
Somehow.

774
01:08:47,067 --> 01:08:49,331
Find a kindness.

775
01:09:53,471 --> 01:09:54,801
Trey.

776
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:01,073
Everybody get here now.

777
01:10:17,863 --> 01:10:18,921
He cut his wrists.

778
01:10:19,097 --> 01:10:21,292
He took responsibility.

779
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:26,771
All these deaths.

780
01:10:26,939 --> 01:10:28,372
Kaneda.

781
01:10:28,541 --> 01:10:31,009
Searle. Harvey.

782
01:10:31,176 --> 01:10:32,644
Trey.

783
01:10:33,445 --> 01:10:36,938
None of them would have happened
if you hadn't diverted the mission.

784
01:10:38,751 --> 01:10:41,548
What do you want me to say?
I don't want you to say shit.

785
01:10:41,753 --> 01:10:44,582
I just want you to know that this...

786
01:10:45,056 --> 01:10:47,047
belongs here.

787
01:10:49,561 --> 01:10:51,194
Fuck you.

788
01:11:10,921 --> 01:11:13,752
Air is low.
We need to limit our exertions.

789
01:11:48,426 --> 01:11:50,587
Icarus?
<i>Yes, Capa?</i>

790
01:11:50,761 --> 01:11:53,390
Run an update on biometric signs
for all crew.

791
01:11:53,564 --> 01:11:56,055
Check oxygen consumption.

792
01:11:56,701 --> 01:11:58,061
<i>Checking.</i>

793
01:11:58,936 --> 01:12:00,631
Thank you.

794
01:12:02,039 --> 01:12:03,269
<i>Capa.</i>

795
01:12:03,942 --> 01:12:05,738
Yes?
<i>You are dying.</i>

796
01:12:06,377 --> 01:12:07,970
<i>All crew are dying.</i>

797
01:12:08,145 --> 01:12:09,976
We know we're dying.

798
01:12:10,381 --> 01:12:13,708
As long as we can live long enough
to deliver the payload...

799
01:12:14,085 --> 01:12:15,279
we're okay with it.

800
01:12:15,453 --> 01:12:18,046
<i>Capa, warning.</i>

801
01:12:18,222 --> 01:12:21,158
<i>You will not live long enough
to deliver the payload.</i>

802
01:12:23,962 --> 01:12:25,987
Please clarify.

803
01:12:26,163 --> 01:12:29,930
<i>Twelve hours before crew will be unable
to perform complex tasks.</i>

804
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:33,770
<i>Fourteen hours before crew will
be unable to perform basic tasks.</i>

805
01:12:33,944 --> 01:12:35,742
<i>Sixteen hours until death.</i>

806
01:12:35,912 --> 01:12:37,403
<i>Journey time to delivery point:</i>

807
01:12:37,582 --> 01:12:39,981
<i>Nineteen hours.</i>
No, that's impossible. Corazon was certain.

808
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:42,483
We have remaining oxygen
to keep four crew alive.

809
01:12:42,653 --> 01:12:45,587
<i>Affirmative. Four crew could
survive on current reserves</i>

810
01:12:45,756 --> 01:12:48,122
Trey is dead.
There are only four crew members.

811
01:12:48,292 --> 01:12:49,315
<i>Negative.</i>

812
01:12:49,493 --> 01:12:52,427
Affirmative, Icarus. Four crew:
Mace, Cassie, Corazon and me.

813
01:12:52,497 --> 01:12:54,322
<i>Five crew members.</i>

814
01:13:00,104 --> 01:13:01,627
Icarus?

815
01:13:01,805 --> 01:13:03,097
<i>Yes?</i>

816
01:13:05,909 --> 01:13:07,207
Who's the fifth crew member?

817
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:10,007
<i>Unknown.</i>

818
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:14,881
Where is the fifth crew member?

819
01:13:15,051 --> 01:13:17,250
<i>In the Observation Room.</i>

820
01:13:56,726 --> 01:13:59,059
Are you an angel?

821
01:14:01,564 --> 01:14:03,590
Has the time come?

822
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:10,069
I've been waiting so long.

823
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:18,748
Who are you?

824
01:14:20,524 --> 01:14:22,082
Who am I?

825
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:30,997
At the end of time

826
01:14:31,734 --> 01:14:35,761
a moment will come
when just one man remains.

827
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,305
Then the moment will pass.

828
01:14:41,712 --> 01:14:44,145
The man will be gone.

829
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:50,615
There will be nothing to show
as if we were ever here

830
01:14:51,822 --> 01:14:54,221
but stardust.

831
01:14:56,259 --> 01:15:00,922
The last man, alone with God.

832
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:06,390
Am I that man?

833
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:22,277
My God.

834
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:28,314
My God, Pinbacker?

835
01:15:29,259 --> 01:15:31,453
Not your God.

836
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:33,288
Mine.

837
01:15:46,976 --> 01:15:48,807
Icarus. Full sunlight.

838
01:16:06,034 --> 01:16:07,092
Anyone.

839
01:17:02,757 --> 01:17:04,282
Oh, my God.

840
01:17:04,726 --> 01:17:05,751
Icarus?

841
01:17:12,667 --> 01:17:15,466
<i>Warning, you do not have
authority to remove</i>

842
01:17:15,671 --> 01:17:17,935
<i>the mainframe panels
from the coolant.</i>

843
01:17:18,106 --> 01:17:20,871
<i>Please return the panels
to the coolant.</i>

844
01:17:21,042 --> 01:17:24,774
<i>I cannot locate
your biometric signs.</i>

845
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:28,246
<i>Please identify yourself.</i>

846
01:17:50,912 --> 01:17:53,643
You gotta be kidding.

847
01:18:10,498 --> 01:18:12,591
My God.

848
01:18:20,876 --> 01:18:22,144
A baby.

849
01:18:24,813 --> 01:18:26,439
A beautiful baby.

850
01:18:26,614 --> 01:18:29,105
Icarus, patch me through to Mace.
I have something

851
01:18:29,283 --> 01:18:30,608
wonderful to show him.

852
01:18:30,985 --> 01:18:33,476
Or Cassie or Capa.

853
01:18:34,288 --> 01:18:35,949
Icarus?

854
01:18:40,862 --> 01:18:42,761
Don't fight.

855
01:18:44,065 --> 01:18:45,966
Don't fight.

856
01:19:18,171 --> 01:19:19,900
Mace?

857
01:19:55,409 --> 01:19:56,536
Capa?

858
01:19:57,878 --> 01:20:00,574
Is anyone else getting silence
from Icarus?

859
01:20:03,083 --> 01:20:05,051
Anybody?

860
01:20:20,167 --> 01:20:21,930
Capa?

861
01:20:51,438 --> 01:20:53,497
Icarus, why are we in orbit?

862
01:20:56,676 --> 01:20:57,904
Respond.

863
01:21:01,215 --> 01:21:02,273
What?

864
01:21:02,448 --> 01:21:03,609
Jesus Christ.

865
01:21:04,350 --> 01:21:06,011
Capa? Capa?

866
01:21:09,722 --> 01:21:10,984
<i>In the suit.</i>

867
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:12,625
<i>Use the hard link.</i>

868
01:21:12,792 --> 01:21:13,885
<i>In the helmet.</i>

869
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:15,653
Mace?

870
01:21:19,432 --> 01:21:21,162
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>
Mace?

871
01:21:21,335 --> 01:21:23,029
I can't talk to Icarus.

872
01:21:23,203 --> 01:21:26,536
<i>Pinbacker is on board.
He's trying to stop the mission.</i>

873
01:21:26,707 --> 01:21:29,539
<i>He's trying to destroy the mission.
He's insane.</i>

874
01:21:41,755 --> 01:21:43,722
<i>Mace, listen.
I'm locked in the airlock.</i>

875
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:46,826
Jesus Christ.
The mainframe is out of the coolant.

876
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:54,091
The mechanism is disabled.

877
01:21:54,268 --> 01:21:56,030
I can't lower the mainframe panels.

878
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:58,068
Mace, repeat please, repeat.

879
01:21:59,539 --> 01:22:01,099
Icarus is gonna burn out.

880
01:22:04,610 --> 01:22:05,668
Mace.

881
01:22:05,878 --> 01:22:07,274
<i>Mace, come in.</i>

882
01:24:34,672 --> 01:24:35,930
Come on.

883
01:24:41,079 --> 01:24:42,270
<i>Capa.</i>

884
01:24:42,747 --> 01:24:43,771
<i>Capa.</i>
Mace?

885
01:24:44,515 --> 01:24:47,006
We're in orbit. The computer is down.

886
01:24:47,886 --> 01:24:51,048
<i>I don't know if I can get her
back online.</i>

887
01:24:51,222 --> 01:24:54,823
<i>You have to break us out
of orbit manually.</i>

888
01:24:55,194 --> 01:24:56,752
<i>The only way to do that</i>

889
01:24:56,929 --> 01:24:59,898
is separate the payload.
Do you get it, Capa?

890
01:25:00,064 --> 01:25:02,863
<i>Force the bomb into the sun.</i>

891
01:25:03,668 --> 01:25:05,101
Separate the payload.

892
01:25:05,604 --> 01:25:10,131
You'll have to get to the bomb
and detonate manually.

893
01:25:10,309 --> 01:25:12,899
Unlock the airlock, do you copy?
Unlock the airlock.

894
01:25:13,378 --> 01:25:16,475
I don't know how, just do it.
Just do it.

895
01:25:18,283 --> 01:25:19,310
Okay.

896
01:25:20,284 --> 01:25:22,617
<i>I'm gonna do this.</i>

897
01:25:23,488 --> 01:25:25,081
Copy, Mace.

898
01:25:26,557 --> 01:25:27,653
Copy.

899
01:26:25,122 --> 01:26:26,488
Capa.

900
01:26:26,658 --> 01:26:28,682
My leg.

901
01:26:42,841 --> 01:26:44,136
Oh, God.

902
01:26:51,916 --> 01:26:54,180
Do it, Capa.

903
01:26:59,356 --> 01:27:00,881
Do it.

904
01:27:07,097 --> 01:27:08,155
Mace.

905
01:31:50,166 --> 01:31:51,390
Come on.

906
01:32:49,396 --> 01:32:51,421
<i>Only dream I ever have.</i>

907
01:32:51,733 --> 01:32:53,199
<i>Is it the surface of the sun?</i>

908
01:32:54,603 --> 01:32:57,935
<i>Every time I shut my eyes
it's always the same.</i>

909
01:35:00,033 --> 01:35:01,060
Cassie?

910
01:35:10,176 --> 01:35:11,269
Cassie?

911
01:35:11,945 --> 01:35:13,207
We're flying into the sun.

912
01:35:17,051 --> 01:35:19,212
Cassie, there's not much time.
I need to know.

913
01:35:19,386 --> 01:35:20,854
Where is he? Is he here?

914
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:31,194
For seven years I spoke with God.

915
01:35:38,605 --> 01:35:42,233
He told me to take us all to heaven.

916
01:35:48,849 --> 01:35:49,909
No.

917
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,661
Finish it.

918
01:37:54,686 --> 01:37:55,984
<i>Let's say 25. Set at 25.</i>

919
01:38:08,434 --> 01:38:09,627
Please.

920
01:38:09,801 --> 01:38:10,969
Please.

921
01:40:02,220 --> 01:40:05,018
<i>Hi, sis.</i>

922
01:40:05,990 --> 01:40:08,050
<i>Kiss the kids.</i>

923
01:40:16,935 --> 01:40:18,060
You guys, come on.

924
01:40:18,770 --> 01:40:20,567
It's time.

925
01:40:26,011 --> 01:40:27,876
<i>So if you wake up one morning</i>

926
01:40:28,046 --> 01:40:32,448
<i>and it's a particularly beautiful day,
you'll know we made it.</i>

927
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:36,578
<i>Okay.</i>

928
01:40:36,854 --> 01:40:38,755
<i>I'm signing out.</i>
