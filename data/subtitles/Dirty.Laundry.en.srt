00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,851
Christine? No, I don't
know any Christine.

169
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,855
Christine?

170
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:07,120
She was always coming around
here lookin' for you.

171
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,925
Fat girl,
standing at the backdoor...

172
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,795
always looking for a snack.

173
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,103
Oh. Yeah.
You're talking about Cookie.

174
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:22,231
Yeah. Cookie.

175
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,213
Oh, my God.

176
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,215
Oh. Cookie?

177
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,217
Yeah. Cookie.

178
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:35,617
Ow.

179
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,849
- You okay?
- No.

180
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,619
You need some water
or some lemonade?

181
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,287
Oh, he don't need no lemonade.

182
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,023
[Grunts]

183
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:53,003
- My chest is tight.
- I guess this qualifies as a special occasion.

184
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,199
There you go.

185
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,175
Ah! Ugh!

186
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,649
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let me get this straight.

187
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,982
- Gabriel-
- That's your son.

188
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:11,045
- And I'm-
- Big daddy.

189
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,990
Big daddy. Oh.

190
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,050
Well, what happened to his mother?

191
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,323
<i>- Phew!
- [Jackie] Well-</i>

192
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,763
Well, where is she?
Where's Cookie?

193
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,666
Well, that's- that's kind
of a hard story, Sheldon.

194
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:27,172
- Damn shame.
- Well, what happened?

195
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,673
Well, I'm gonna let
Jackie tell that story.

196
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:33,007
Okay. Well, um,
it all started about...

197
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,672
two or three years
after you left town.

198
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,216
That poor Cookie,
she was a goddamn mess.

199
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:42,243
I mean, she was just all
destroyed after you left.

200
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,051
<i>She cryin'all the time,
yellin' out your name.</i>

201
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,285
We didn't even know
about Gabe at that point.

202
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,494
Okay. All right.
So what-what happened?

203
00:13:49,627 --> 00:13:54,530
Well, you know, she tried
to get her life on track.

204
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:56,726
She was still a big girl.

205
00:13:56,801 --> 00:13:59,292
- Big?
- Ooh, real big.

206
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,838
<i>- Big?
- All right, real big.</i>

207
00:14:01,906 --> 00:14:06,707
She joined up with
a big-girl stripper troupe.

208
00:14:06,777 --> 00:14:10,645
<i>They would travel around
the lodges and restaurants and bars...</i>

209
00:14:10,715 --> 00:14:12,649
fat-boy bachelor parties-

210
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:16,414
any place where men wanted
to see big booties in G-strings.

211
00:14:16,487 --> 00:14:18,955
<i>Now, personally,
I think that's nasty.</i>

212
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:22,959
I don't know why anybody would
want to see anything like that.

213
00:14:23,027 --> 00:14:25,996
<i>Big old booties hanging
out of a G-string...</i>

214
00:14:26,063 --> 00:14:29,260
like a uneven apple on one side
and then all flabby, you know, on the-

215
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,961
Mama, please,
just tell me what happened.

216
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:34,004
Well, okay.

217
00:14:34,071 --> 00:14:38,201
In any case, they had just
finished doin' a show.

218
00:14:38,276 --> 00:14:41,803
I think it was at Ruby's House
of Chickens and Ribs.

219
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:45,144
- Yep.
- And they got back on the tour bus.

220
00:14:45,216 --> 00:14:48,845
- The driver was one of the girls in the tour.
- Uh-huh.

221
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,286
Well, apparently, the driver
reached for a rib...

222
00:14:51,355 --> 00:14:54,188
that was left over in her purse...

223
00:14:54,258 --> 00:14:56,317
[Sighs]
And didn't see the deer in the road.

224
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:58,658
Oh, my God.
So she hit the deer.

225
00:14:58,729 --> 00:15:02,961
No. Apparently, she got
barbecue sauce in her eyes...

226
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:06,128
and the bus just went careening
off the side of the road.

227
00:15:06,203 --> 00:15:09,172
- What?
- Everybody was killed.

228
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,538
Freak fat stripper accident.

229
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:14,703
- Oh.
- And while they were cleaning up the wreckage...

230
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:19,011
they found Gabriel's birth certificate
hidden inside a take-out menu.

231
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,313
A take-out menu.

232
00:15:21,385 --> 00:15:24,218
Mm-hmm. And that's when Gabe
came here to live with us.

233
00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:27,689
<i>Yeah, it was just recently
he started to ask about his daddy, and...</i>

234
00:15:27,758 --> 00:15:31,956
well, I guess that just
got the ball rolling and here you are.

235
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:34,156
<i>Boy, what you doing?</i>

236
00:15:34,231 --> 00:15:37,257
I'm writing a check.
You know, I didn't sign up for this.

237
00:15:37,335 --> 00:15:39,360
So why don't you call me
if there's an emergency...

238
00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:41,371
or you need an organ
transplant or something?

239
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:45,136
Boy, you're gonna need a transplant
if you don't get up there and talk to that boy.

240
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:48,542
Sheldon!
Now, why is he so strange?

241
00:15:48,613 --> 00:15:50,911
- Mm-mmm.
- Lord.

242
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:59,719
- So, how do you like living with Aunt Jackie?
- And Gran. She's cool.

243
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,350
Huh. Give it time.
Give it time.

244
00:16:02,426 --> 00:16:05,691
- I tried telling you.
- Yeah, about that-You know, I'm sorry.

245
00:16:05,763 --> 00:16:08,960
I'm just not really
good at, uh-Anyway.

246
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:11,001
- You don't like kids, do you?
- No.

247
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:17,029
I mean- I mean, no,
I don't not like kids.

248
00:16:17,108 --> 00:16:19,906
I mean, they're real little people.

249
00:16:19,977 --> 00:16:23,538
You know?
And they're- they're great if you like kids.

But which I do.

251
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,242
I do.
It's just, uh, kids.

252
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,153
You know?

253
00:16:32,223 --> 00:16:35,989
[Sighs]
Listen.

254
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:41,225
I'm really glad that we, you know,
had this time to meet.

255
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:45,462
And I think that we're gonna end up
being really great friends.

256
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:52,607
Okay. Well, you know,
I think it's really getting late.

257
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:54,611
Oh, yeah.
I better get to bed.

258
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,874
Okay. All right.

259
00:16:58,482 --> 00:17:01,645
Okay.
[Exhales]

260
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:04,051
[Chuckles]
Well, that was easy.

261
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:12,118
[Sighs] Okay, Jackie, where is a guy
to get some sleep around here?

262
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:15,290
- Your old room's right upstairs.
- Oh, right.

263
00:17:15,366 --> 00:17:20,133
But before you go,
you finish these dishes.

264
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:22,934
- [Laughs]
- Sheldon!

265

[Snoring]

266
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:02,534
- He don't look foreign.
- He's not foreign. He's from New York.

267
00:18:02,613 --> 00:18:05,810
- [Snoring]
- He smells funny.

268
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:09,444
- It's probably fancy cologne.
- Why is he wearing cologne? He have a date?

269

<i>[Boy]
It's this stuff.</i>

270
00:18:13,858 --> 00:18:17,350
- It smells good.
- It's probably expensive.

271
00:18:17,428 --> 00:18:21,057
Duh! Yeah. Everything
in New York is expensive.

272
00:18:21,132 --> 00:18:24,499
Why is he wearing that mask?
He a superhero?

273
00:18:24,568 --> 00:18:26,502
That's stupid.

274
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,504
Maybe he's a cat burglar.

I didn't mean to, but I gotta get up early
and practice my moves.

285

- Right.
- The dance recital is next week...

286
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:23,817

as much as I can.

You know what?
Is there someplace in town...

00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:51,276
where I can get online and do
some research on the Internet?

317

There ain't nothing on that
Internet but porn and bad music.

318
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:56,182
You need to go to the library
and crack a book.

There's computers
at the library you can use.

- Uh-uh. I don't have time for that.
I don't want to hear it.

<i>Oh, yeah! In honor to God,

Used Automobiles and Boats.

701
00:42:22,002 --> 00:42:25,335
He and I just want
to make a small donation...

702
00:42:25,405 --> 00:42:28,636
for the uniforms
for the junior usher board.

703
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:30,642
Hallelu-

704
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,338
- Sit down, Lettie.
- Mm-mmm.

705
00:42:33,413 --> 00:42:38,783
A check in the amount of $1,000.

706
00:42:38,852 --> 00:42:43,346
<i>- [Man] Yeah!
- [Lettuce] Thank you. Thank you very much.</i>

707
00:42:43,423 --> 00:42:46,654
- Thank you.
- Sit down.

708
00:42:46,726 --> 00:42:50,685
I am simply testifying
to the glory of the Lord! Hallelujah!

709
00:42:50,764 --> 00:42:55,133
Sounds like you're testifyin' about the size
of your bank account.

<i>[Congregation]
Ooh!</i>

711
00:42:57,204 --> 00:42:59,138
Evelyn, that's a hurtful

712
00:42:59,206 --> 00:43:01,674

[Snickers]

715
00:43:06,913 --> 00:43:10,576
<i>Well, today's sermon
is gonna come to us from...</i>

716
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:13,118
- Luke, 15th chapter.
- Mm-hmm.

717
00:43:13,186 --> 00:43:15,211
<i>- [Woman] All right.
- The 11th through the 32nd verse.</i>

718
00:43:15,288 --> 00:43:17,222
- All right.
- All right.

719
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:19,224
<i>- Prodigal son.
- [Man] Yes, sir!</i>

720
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:23,956
Here's a sermon that all of you should hear
because it actually talks about forgiveness.

721
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:26,294
- Yes.
- And how to love one another.

722
00:43:26,366 --> 00:43:28,357
I can't believe I'm here.

723
00:43:28,435 --> 00:43:30,562
Shh!

724
00:43:30,637 --> 00:43:34,368
I like the story. It goes like this.
You know, the man had two sons.

725
00:43:34,441 --> 00:43:36,375
Don't you "shh" me.

726
00:43:36,443 --> 00:43:38,377
- I'll "shh" you whenever I want.
- Shh!

727
00:43:38,445 --> 00:43:40,470
- Shh!
- Sheldon.

728
00:43:40,547 --> 00:43:42,208
Psst. Psst.

729
00:43:42,282 --> 00:43:46,150
Hey. I'm a good cook.

730
00:43:46,219 --> 00:43:49,985
<i>[Pastor James]... go off and live a little bit,
you know. Don't wanna stay here with you.</i>

731
00:43:50,056 --> 00:43:52,183
So the father thought
about it for a moment.

732
00:43:52,259 --> 00:43:54,250
He said, "Well,
that's what he wants to do.

733
00:43:54,327 --> 00:43:56,261
I'll let him spread his wings."

734
00:43:56,329 --> 00:43:58,695
- You know about spreading
your wings, right? All right.
- Yes.

735
00:44:00,767 --> 00:44:02,701

736
00:44:02,769 --> 00:44:04,703

Good to see you here today,
my brother. You know-

741
00:44:19,352 --> 00:44:22,048
Oh, Pastor James, we have got to go.

742
00:44:22,122 --> 00:44:25,819
But I will be calling you.
I have some ideas for your sermon next week.

743
00:44:25,892 --> 00:44:31,762
Um, backsliders, honor thy mother and father.
I'll do you one better than that.

744
00:44:31,831 --> 00:44:34,493
I'm gonna write my thoughts
out on a pad of paper, okay?

745
00:44:34,568 --> 00:44:38,231
- But we must go. Come on, Son.
- God bless you. Good luck, my son.

746
00:44:38,305 --> 00:44:40,239
- Yep.
- He never shut up.

747

<i>¢ÜI got the-¢Ü¢Ü Check the bucket.

750
00:44:49,849 --> 00:44:51,783
Tried to short me
on the breasts last time...

751
00:44:51,851 --> 00:44:53,785
fillin' that bucket
with nothin' but wings.

752
00:44:56,156 --> 00:44:58,420
My fried okra in there
and hot sauce?

753
00:44:58,491 --> 00:45:00,823
<i>- Pudge, check for the biscuits.
- [Jackie] Yes, Mama. Yes.</i>

754
00:45:00,894 --> 00:45:04,330
- All right then.
- Hmm. Sunday brunch.

755
00:45:05,865 --> 00:45:07,958
Nice. Dignified.

756
00:45:10,136 --> 00:45:15,335
Sitting waterfront, eating egg-white omelets
and a glass of champagne.

757
00:45:15,408 --> 00:45:18,138
What you mumbling about?

758
00:45:18,211 --> 00:45:20,145
Uh, nothing.
Nothing, nothing.

759
00:45:20,213 --> 00:45:23,478
I was just thinking
about being home...

760
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:26,178
having brunch with, uh-

761
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,579
- Ryan?
- Who?

762
00:45:29,656 --> 00:45:31,487
<i>[Pudge]
Who's that man on the porch?</i>

763
00:45:31,558 --> 00:45:33,856
- I don't know.
- It's a white man.

764
00:45:33,927 --> 00:45:35,918
Is he from the gas company?

765
00:45:42,068 --> 00:45:44,002
[Groans]

766
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:49,800
Ryan, what are you doing here?
How did you get here?

767
00:45:49,876 --> 00:45:53,277
- Airplane, silly.
- You know exactly what I'm talking about.

768
00:45:53,346 --> 00:45:55,974
- I found the tickets, Patrick.
- Sheldon, what's going on?

769
00:45:56,049 --> 00:45:57,983
- Uh-
- Who's Sheldon?

770
00:45:58,051 --> 00:46:01,680
- Uh- Oh, God.
- Who's this?

771
00:46:01,755 --> 00:46:04,019
- This-
- I'm his mother. Who are you?

772
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:07,617
[Scoffs] I don't think so.
Patrick's mom lives in France.

773
00:46:07,694 --> 00:46:10,663
France?
Sheldon, what is going on?

774
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:12,664
- Who's Sheldon? Baby, you-
- Uh-

775

- Mama, watch your mouth.
- Sheldon, who is that?

781
00:46:35,055 --> 00:46:39,185
His name is Ryan,
and he is my partner.

782
00:46:39,259 --> 00:46:41,727
- Partner?
- Yes, my partner.

783
00:46:41,795 --> 00:46:43,854
Okay?
We-We're together.

784
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:47,331
- The white boy?
- Let's not make this more dramatic-

785
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,334
Dramatic?

786
00:46:49,402 --> 00:46:51,370
You got a lot of nerve!

787
00:46:51,438 --> 00:46:54,407
Right in your-
Inviting your partner into my house!

788
00:46:54,474 --> 00:46:57,272
- I didn't invite him here.
- What you mean you didn't invite him?

789
00:46:57,344 --> 00:46:59,403
- That's not the point, Jackie.
- Then what does matter, Sheldon?

790
00:46:59,479 --> 00:47:00,912
It doesn't matter.
It's irrelevant.

791
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:03,005
Boy, I'm going to relevant
you all over this house.

792
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:05,017
Ooh! Partner?

793
00:47:06,186 --> 00:47:08,552
- A white boy? In my house?
- Mama.

794
00:47:08,621 --> 00:47:10,680
And on a Sunday too!

795
00:47:10,757 --> 00:47:12,691
Come on, Mama.

796
00:47:12,759 --> 00:47:16,058
Didn't- Didn't I cover this when
I told you about the birds and the bees?

797
00:47:16,129 --> 00:47:18,461
Yeah, I remember
the conversation very well.

798
00:47:18,531 --> 00:47:20,522
"Sheldon, don't get
any girls pregnant...

799
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,534
and don't bring home
any white girls."

800
00:47:22,602 --> 00:47:26,129
- I remember.
- Well, I guess I must have left something out.

801
00:47:26,206 --> 00:47:29,107
Excuse me.
I'm really sorry.

802
00:47:29,175 --> 00:47:31,541
Patrick, can I speak
with you for a minute?

803
00:47:36,683 --> 00:47:38,617
Yeah.

804
00:47:38,685 --> 00:47:41,813
Sit down, Mama.
Mama, sit down.

805
00:47:41,888 --> 00:47:43,913
- Oh, I'm okay, Jackie.
- Sit down, Mama.

806
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:46,049
- Mama, just sit down, please.
- Oh.

807
00:47:49,729 --> 00:47:52,357
- I'm leaving.
- What?

808
00:47:52,432 --> 00:47:54,627
- I'm leaving.
- Ryan, you just got here.

809
00:47:54,701 --> 00:47:57,932
<i>Yeah, and it's already more drama
than a double episode of the Gilmore Girls.</i>

810
00:47:58,004 --> 00:48:00,165
Don't leave.

811
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,732
I mean, has our whole entire relationship
just been built on lies?

812
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:05,971
No. I love you.
I always have.

813
00:48:06,045 --> 00:48:09,105
And that's just supposed to make
everything better, huh?

814
00:48:09,182 --> 00:48:13,118
You know, Dr. Phil says that a love
built on a foundation of lies and mistrust...

815
00:48:13,186 --> 00:48:15,450
is just like
Joan Rivers's face- fake.

816
00:48:17,657 --> 00:48:21,286
Look, you know what?
I really don't think that Dr. Phil said that.

817
00:48:21,361 --> 00:48:23,522
Don't patronize me right now.

818
00:48:23,596 --> 00:48:25,530
Calm down. Stay.

819
00:48:25,598 --> 00:48:28,260
[Sighs]
Don't leave.

820
00:48:28,334 --> 00:48:30,802
- I'm leaving.
- No, you're not.

821
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:33,065
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

822
00:48:33,139 --> 00:48:35,573
<i>[Evelyn]
Yes, he is!</i>

823
00:48:36,709 --> 00:48:38,643
[Whispering]
No, you're not.

824
00:48:38,711 --> 00:48:41,077
<i>Yes, he is!</i>

825
00:48:41,147 --> 00:48:43,672
- [Sighs]
- [Whispering] Come here.

826
00:48:46,085 --> 00:48:48,019
You know, I must say...

827
00:48:48,087 --> 00:48:50,351
this is some of the best
chicken I've ever had.

828
00:48:51,624 --> 00:48:54,388
It came from the chicken shack
down the street.

829
00:48:54,461 --> 00:48:57,328
You know, Patrick
never lets us eat like this.

830
00:48:57,397 --> 00:48:59,831
He always wants to eat
some schmancy fancy food...

831
00:48:59,899 --> 00:49:03,357
and I'm like, "Muh!
Give me a corn dog, you know?"

832
00:49:10,443 --> 00:49:12,911
[Sighs]

833
00:49:16,382 --> 00:49:19,545
This... is nice.

834
00:49:19,619 --> 00:49:22,179
Could you excuse us for a minute?

835
00:49:22,255 --> 00:49:23,882
Oh.

836
00:49:26,593 --> 00:49:28,788
And I'm gonna go check on the kids.

837
00:49:38,204 --> 00:49:41,264
You were always ashamed
to be a part of this family.

838
00:49:41,341 --> 00:49:43,571
Oh, God. Please, man,
don't start with me now.

839
00:49:43,643 --> 00:49:46,407
- You know that's not true.
- [Scoffs] Really?

840
00:49:46,479 --> 00:49:49,744
You walk around here with them big-ass ideas
like you was better than everybody else.

841
00:49:49,816 --> 00:49:53,752
Okay. It's not my fault that I didn't want
to be a manager of a butcher shop.

842
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:56,152
That's a good job.

843
00:49:56,222 --> 00:49:59,020
And it paid for your fancy ass
for many a year.

844
00:49:59,092 --> 00:50:01,560
- You got one more time to call me fancy.
- You know what?

845
00:50:01,628 --> 00:50:03,858
- Just callin' it like I see it, bro.
- That's it right there.

846
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:06,558
<i>That's exactly why I didn't wanna spend
the rest of my fuckin' life-</i>

847
00:50:06,633 --> 00:50:09,466
- Now, wait a fuckin' minute.
- In this little small-ass town...

848
00:50:09,536 --> 00:50:11,401
<i>with simple people with small ideas.</i>

849
00:50:11,471 --> 00:50:14,440
I'm the only one that can use
that language in my house, boy.

850
00:50:14,507 --> 00:50:16,270
Mama, I'm not a boy.
I'm a man.

851
00:50:16,342 --> 00:50:19,937
See, that is your problem, Sheldon.
Always sassin' and talkin' back.

852
00:50:20,013 --> 00:50:21,947
You always had too much pride.

853
00:50:22,015 --> 00:50:25,451
Mama, do you know
how long it took me...

854
00:50:25,518 --> 00:50:28,282
<i>to finally feel good about who I am?</i>

855
00:50:28,354 --> 00:50:30,379
I don't know what you're
talkin' about, Sheldon.

856
00:50:30,456 --> 00:50:33,619
<i>- I have always-
- Have you ever looked at me for who I am?</i>

857
00:50:33,693 --> 00:50:38,398
- Sheldon, I see you.
- Oh, hell, Mama. Everybody can see.

858
00:50:40,633 --> 00:50:43,659
Do you realize how hard it was
growing up around here?

859
00:50:43,736 --> 00:50:46,967
You know, feeling like I never
was really a part of anything...

860
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:49,064
or feeling like something
was wrong with me.

861
00:50:49,142 --> 00:50:52,942
I always raised my kids not to even care
about what other people think.

862
00:50:53,012 --> 00:50:56,607
- Mama, I'm talking about you.
- Excuse me?

863
00:50:56,682 --> 00:50:58,775
I never felt good enough.

864
00:50:58,851 --> 00:51:00,819
At all. Never.

865
00:51:00,887 --> 00:51:03,822
You know, I couldn't say the right things,
I couldn't do the right things.

866
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:06,484
You know, I just- I felt
like I always came up short.

867
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:10,017
- Sheldon. Now, you know that-
- Did you ever accept me for being me?

868
00:51:10,096 --> 00:51:12,030
- Well, what about you, Sheldon?
- Excuse me?

869
00:51:12,098 --> 00:51:14,931
Always lookin' down your nose
at your own family.

870
00:51:15,001 --> 00:51:18,266
<i>- Oh, come on.
- Oh, listen to you now. Poor Sheldon.</i>

871
00:51:18,337 --> 00:51:22,899
- "Nobody understands me. Nobody loves me."
- That's bullshit, man.

872
00:51:22,975 --> 00:51:25,842
- You are full of bullshit.
- Shut up, Eugene, 'cause you don't even know me.

873
00:51:25,912 --> 00:51:29,439
No. You don't know yourself, bro.
That's your problem. You're not proud of yourself.

874
00:51:29,515 --> 00:51:31,676
Man, that is the last thing
that I need.

875
00:51:31,751 --> 00:51:35,881
Some psychoanalysis from a guy
who cuts meat at a butcher shop.

876
00:51:35,955 --> 00:51:38,185
Butcher shop, huh?

877
00:51:39,659 --> 00:51:42,093
That's fine. I guess you
can talk about me, huh?

878
00:51:42,161 --> 00:51:44,129
'Cause I just work
at a butcher shop.

879
00:51:44,197 --> 00:51:47,394
And you've done gone off and made
this whole new life for yourself, huh, Sheldon?

880
00:51:47,467 --> 00:51:49,833
- Well-
- Oh, wait a minute. That's right. I'm sorry.

881
00:51:49,902 --> 00:51:52,837
It's Patrick now.
Patrick the writer.

882
00:51:52,905 --> 00:51:55,396
<i>Patrick the man about town.</i>

883
00:51:55,475 --> 00:51:59,468
Man, you think you are smarter than everybody
else and better than everybody else.

884
00:51:59,545 --> 00:52:02,878
Better than me. Better than Mama.
You don't know yourself, boy.

885
00:52:02,949 --> 00:52:05,474
You know, Eugene, listen to me.

886
00:52:05,551 --> 00:52:10,614
- I am not ashamed of who I am.
- Oh, you're proud of who you are?

887
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:14,319
Is that why little Swiss Miss out there thought
Mama was some supermodel in France?

888
00:52:14,393 --> 00:52:18,090
<i>You so damn proud of yourself, but apparently
you couldn't tell your fancy-ass friends...</i>

889
00:52:18,164 --> 00:52:21,224
- that your mama ain't nothing
but a washwoman, huh, boy?
- Sheldon, is that true?

890
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,768
<i>- Mama, l-
- [Eugene] You need to look in the mirror, boy.</i>

891
00:52:23,836 --> 00:52:26,930
- Look in the mirror.
- Could you guys keep your voices down?

892
00:52:28,574 --> 00:52:31,338
You know what? You think you know everything,
and you don't know shit.

893
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:32,934
<i>- [Eugene] Really?
- [Sheldon] Really!</i>

894
00:52:33,012 --> 00:52:37,244
All you do is whine.
Talk about yourself.

895
00:52:37,316 --> 00:52:39,841
<i>Complain about yourself.
You didn't even care about your own son!</i>

896
00:52:39,919 --> 00:52:41,887
Look, I didn't ask
to have a damn kid, okay?

897
00:52:41,954 --> 00:52:44,047
<i>Everybody shut up!</i>

898
00:52:44,123 --> 00:52:46,091
<i>[Sheldon]
Know what? This is simple. It's real simple.</i>

899
00:52:46,158 --> 00:52:48,217
<i>Wanna know why I didn't
come back here for 10 years?</i>

900
00:52:48,294 --> 00:52:50,956
<i>Because I didn't want
to have to look in the mirror...</i>

901
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:53,362
and realize one day
that I had become you!

902
00:52:55,134 --> 00:52:57,125
Sheldon.

903
00:52:58,771 --> 00:53:01,706
<i>[Sheldon Narrating]
Let's go back a couple chapters.</i>

904
00:53:01,774 --> 00:53:03,605
<i>[Typing]</i>

905
00:53:03,676 --> 00:53:07,669
<i>I had a wonderful life
in New York City.</i>

906
00:53:07,747 --> 00:53:10,773
<i>And why wouldn't I?
I had the perfect job-</i>

907
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:13,910
<i>a successful writer
at a prominent magazine.</i>

908
00:53:13,986 --> 00:53:15,544
- [Knocking]
- Yes?

909
00:53:15,621 --> 00:53:17,213
You're late.

910
00:53:19,158 --> 00:53:22,252
This month's cover just hit the stands,
and the buzz is phenomenal.

911
00:53:22,328 --> 00:53:25,229
We are on fire.
All I keep hearing...

912
00:53:25,298 --> 00:53:28,165
is how this absolutely captures
the drive, the energy...

913
00:53:28,234 --> 00:53:30,725
the struggle of what
it's like for today's woman...

914
00:53:30,803 --> 00:53:33,294
<i>to be successful, both at home
and in the marketplace.</i>

915
00:53:33,372 --> 00:53:37,172
It is very new,
very now, very modern...

916
00:53:37,243 --> 00:53:40,110
and very, very, very Susan.

917
00:53:41,881 --> 00:53:43,940
Thank you, everyone. I really
couldn't have done it-

918
00:53:44,016 --> 00:53:46,075
Oh, Patrick, so nice
of you to join us.

919
00:53:46,152 --> 00:53:48,120
Oh, I am so very sorry.

920
00:53:48,187 --> 00:53:52,624
- He was drinking coffee.
- I spilled coffee on my tie.

921
00:53:52,692 --> 00:53:57,129
Okay, Liz, be a love and get us two coffees,
would you, dear? Patrick, what'll you have?

922
00:53:57,196 --> 00:54:00,029
Uh, yeah. I'll have
a mochaccino grande...

923
00:54:00,099 --> 00:54:03,432
made with decaffeinated
native bean, uh, soy milk...

924
00:54:03,502 --> 00:54:06,471
<i>heavy on the foam
and a hint of nutmeg.</i>

925
00:54:06,539 --> 00:54:08,666
- Okay? Thank you.
- Two black coffees, dear.

926
00:54:08,741 --> 00:54:10,470
<i>- What about his mochaccino?
- For next month's magazine...</i>

927
00:54:10,543 --> 00:54:13,103
we're gonna have a wonderful photo
of myself and the dog, Winston.

928
00:54:13,179 --> 00:54:15,170
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Yes?

929
00:54:15,247 --> 00:54:18,978
Well, this month's cover, Susan-
I didn't notice my article.

930
00:54:19,051 --> 00:54:22,282
- I got your latest article.
So anyway, Winston and l-
- And?

931
00:54:27,326 --> 00:54:30,853
- [Chuckles] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Susan.
- I hated it.

932
00:54:32,398 --> 00:54:34,730
Susan, I've been very good
to this magazine.

933
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,566
Well, of course you have. Otherwise I never
would've hired you to work for Susan Fairchild.

934
00:54:38,638 --> 00:54:41,129
- Okay. So what's the problem?
- There's no grit.

935
00:54:41,207 --> 00:54:43,641
There's no emotional depth.
It just doesn't pop.

936
00:54:43,709 --> 00:54:45,574
- Pop.
- It's boring.

937
00:54:45,645 --> 00:54:47,408
- Boring.
- Boring?

938
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,414
- Boring.
- As a friend, I adore you...

939
00:54:49,482 --> 00:54:51,814
but as your editor,
you bore the hell out of me.

940
00:54:52,718 --> 00:54:55,050
Susan, are you firing me?

941
00:54:55,121 --> 00:54:57,055
No, no, no, no, no.
Nothing like that.

942
00:54:57,123 --> 00:55:00,820
What I do think is you should go back
to the drawing board. Take a couple of months-

943
00:55:00,893 --> 00:55:04,226
<i>two, three, four, six.</i>

944
00:55:04,296 --> 00:55:06,890
<i>And come back with something fresh.</i>

945
00:55:06,966 --> 00:55:09,901
Get real, Patrick.
You're a writer. Now write.

946
00:55:09,969 --> 00:55:12,836
- Uh-
- Thank you. For next month's cover,
Winston and I are-

947
00:55:12,905 --> 00:55:15,499
<i>[Sheldon Narrating] You know how we're always
looking for that one person...</i>

948
00:55:15,574 --> 00:55:19,442
<i>who accepts us for exactly who we are,
warts and all?</i>

949
00:55:19,512 --> 00:55:21,673
<i>Well, I found him.</i>

950
00:55:21,747 --> 00:55:23,942
Well, it's their loss.

951
00:55:24,016 --> 00:55:26,507
Me. Fired.
I can't believe it.

952
00:55:26,585 --> 00:55:30,385
Well, I mean, she didn't really fire you.
She just said that you should-

953
00:55:30,456 --> 00:55:32,447
You needed to take some time off.

954
00:55:33,993 --> 00:55:36,461
[Together]
Fired.

955
00:55:36,529 --> 00:55:38,554
Two years.
That job was so perfect.

956
00:55:38,631 --> 00:55:41,600
- Nothing's perfect, baby.
- We are.

957
00:55:41,667 --> 00:55:43,396
- Oh.
- [Chuckles]

958
00:55:43,469 --> 00:55:45,767
Well, maybe now you can-

959
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:47,999
you can write that book
you've always wanted to...

960
00:55:48,074 --> 00:55:50,907
<i>- and you'll become super famous
and everyone will want you.
- Right.</i>

961
00:55:50,976 --> 00:55:52,910
And then you can
make tons of money...

962
00:55:52,978 --> 00:55:55,811
and buy the magazine back
and totally fire her ass.

963
00:55:55,881 --> 00:55:57,872
[Laughs]
Yeah, yeah.

964
00:55:57,950 --> 00:56:01,442
You are goofy. You know that?
Cute but goofy.

965
00:56:02,788 --> 00:56:05,882
And we're gonna have mini quiches.

966
00:56:05,958 --> 00:56:08,426
- Mmm. Do I have to come?
- Yes.

967
00:56:08,494 --> 00:56:11,463
It's my three-year anniversary.
You're my best friend.

968
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:15,296
It's not like you guys are married. You know,
honestly, I don't know what you see in him.

969
00:56:15,367 --> 00:56:17,392
He loves me and we wear
the same size shoe.

970
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:20,837
- I think I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.
- Ooh.

971
00:56:20,906 --> 00:56:22,840
You know,
and another thing-

972
00:56:22,908 --> 00:56:25,172
Patrick has never once complained
about my acting career...

973
00:56:25,244 --> 00:56:27,906
- or any of-
- Or lack thereof.

974
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:29,914
<i>That's what I'm talking about.</i>

975
00:56:29,982 --> 00:56:32,849
You're my best friend and you are constantly
ragging on me all the time.

976
00:56:32,918 --> 00:56:35,887
I'm just saying that
nude musical theater...

977
00:56:35,955 --> 00:56:37,980
isn't the fast track to Broadway.

978
00:56:38,057 --> 00:56:41,788

No. Don't say it like that, man.

1201
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:04,658
'Cause they have all these turkey products
that taste like pork.

1202

There's the turkey bacon and turkey ham...

1298
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:52,174
- Mm-hmm. You'd be great.
- That's a first.

1299
01:15:52,244 --> 01:15:55,236
No one's ever thought
I was talented before.

1300
01:15:55,314 --> 01:15:59,250
- You like it here?
- Yeah, it's not so bad.

1301
01:15:59,318 --> 01:16:02,151
- Everybody always fighting.
- You should see my family.

1302
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:05,280
- [Snorts] They're worse than this?
- A lot worse.

1303
01:16:05,357 --> 01:16:07,348
I mean, your family's not so bad.

1304
01:16:07,426 --> 01:16:10,418
<i>A little dysfunctional,
with some underlying anger issues...</i>

1305
01:16:10,495 --> 01:16:13,259
<i>but, really, it's not that bad.</i>

1306
01:16:13,332 --> 01:16:16,199
Well, I can't wait to leave here.

1307
01:16:16,268 --> 01:16:18,964
<i>- Me and my mom are gonna be leaving here soon.
- For reals?</i>

1308

<i>Yeah, she gots a new job
working for the airline.</i>

1309
01:16:21,707 --> 01:16:23,834
- Pilot?
- Flight attendant.

1310
01:16:23,909 --> 01:16:26,707
Oh, right.
That's even better.

1311
01:16:26,778 --> 01:16:30,407
I mean, free peanuts and access to all those
little tiny bottles of liquor.

1312
01:16:30,482 --> 01:16:34,043
- Oh, and your mom's
gonna look hot in that uniform.
- Yeah, but Gran don't know.

1313
01:16:34,119 --> 01:16:37,748
- Why not?
- She wants us to stay here
and be miserable like her.

1314
01:16:37,823 --> 01:16:40,986
<i>Hey. That's no way to talk
about your grandmother.</i>

1315
01:16:41,059 --> 01:16:42,993
I'm sure she loves you.

1316
01:16:43,061 --> 01:16:45,791
Mom says she means well,
but just chases folks away.

1317
01:16:45,864 --> 01:16:49,163
<i>Guess that's what happened
to Grandpa, and Uncle Sheldon, and now Mom.</i>

1318
01:16:49,234 --> 01:16:51,896
They all left and never came back.

1319
01:16:51,970 --> 01:16:55,098
Well, your uncle came back.

1320
01:16:55,173 --> 01:16:57,903
I mean, who knows?

1321
01:16:57,976 --> 01:17:00,376
Maybe he'll stick around.

1322
01:17:00,445 --> 01:17:02,572
He has a kid now.

1323
01:17:02,648 --> 01:17:06,846
Hmm. He'll probably be goin' back
to New York City, and then she'll be all alone.

1324
01:17:08,053 --> 01:17:10,647
Maybe.

1325
01:17:10,722 --> 01:17:12,656

1326
01:17:14,259 --> 01:17:16,727

With all my heart.

1328
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:24,200
You'd never chase him away?

1329
01:17:24,269 --> 01:17:27,705

Never.

1330
01:17:27,773 --> 01:17:29,707

1331

Enough of all this serious talk.

- Well, there is one boy.
- Oh?

1334
01:17:43,655 --> 01:17:47,318
Okay, well, think of Lattrice

1335
01:17:47,392 --> 01:17:49,690

1336
01:17:49,761 --> 01:17:51,592
Grilled cheese.

1337
01:17:51,663 --> 01:17:56,259
No. I was thinking of more along the lines
of maybe a puppy dog or world peace.

1338
01:17:56,334 --> 01:17:58,802
No. Grilled cheese.

1339
01:17:58,870 --> 01:18:00,861
Okay.
Grilled cheese it is.

1340
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:04,238
All right. So...

<i>You see the grilled cheese.

1343

1344
01:18:14,352 --> 01:18:17,048
- Hi.
- Hi! Hi is good.

1345
01:18:17,122 --> 01:18:21,616
Good, good, good, good, good. And then
you introduce yourself, and what happens?

1346
01:18:21,693 --> 01:18:25,493
- Then I throw up.
- Grilled cheese. Grilled cheese.

1347
01:18:25,564 --> 01:18:27,930
Okay. So I can talk to a sandwich.

Oh, big-ass kids.

1614
01:33:31,435 --> 01:33:33,767
Titties bigger than mine in here.

1615
01:33:33,837 --> 01:33:36,465
Eatin' up all the damn cake.

1616
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:38,599
[Mumbling]
Oh, this is good.

1617
01:33:41,011 --> 01:33:43,912
Oh, heavenly spirit,
we thank you for this wonderful opportunity...

1618
01:33:43,981 --> 01:33:47,178
for us to get together-
family- and breaking bread.

1619
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:49,741
Things haven't always been easy.
Things haven't always been right.

1620
01:33:49,820 --> 01:33:52,653
But we here, so, um,
let's eat. Come on.

1621
01:33:55,425 --> 01:33:58,326
<i>Pass me some chicken, boy.</i>

1622
01:33:58,395 --> 01:34:00,420
<i>I don't know.
Let's just eat.</i>

1623
01:34:00,497 --> 01:34:02,988
Mmm, mmm!

1624
01:34:03,066 --> 01:34:05,159
Evelyn, this is all wonderful.

1625
01:34:05,235 --> 01:34:08,932
- Everything is just perfect.
- Thanks.

1626
01:34:09,006 --> 01:34:11,873
You were always
the domesticated one.

1627
01:34:11,942 --> 01:34:14,069
<i>Cook, clean.</i>

1628
01:34:14,144 --> 01:34:17,045
I had to marry money.
Mm-hmm.

1629
01:34:17,114 --> 01:34:21,016
I couldn't even do what you do,
and you do it so well.

1630
01:34:22,085 --> 01:34:24,280
Thanks, Lettuce.

1631
01:34:24,354 --> 01:34:26,549
So, Trae-Trae, how's
the whole rap thing going?

1632
01:34:26,623 --> 01:34:28,887
Well, coz...

1633
01:34:28,959 --> 01:34:32,258
I can call it good, solid,
flowin' and rollin'.

1634
01:34:32,329 --> 01:34:35,264
Mm-hmm. Jimmy's financing
a demo for him.

1635
01:34:35,332 --> 01:34:37,664
- His record drop next month.
- Go on, Trae baby.

1636
01:34:37,734 --> 01:34:39,964
- Do some of that rappin' for us.
- No, Mama.

1637
01:34:40,037 --> 01:34:42,870
- Let everybody hear you.
- Oh, come on, Son. You always got to be ready.

1638
01:34:42,939 --> 01:34:45,772
First of all, I'm not your son.

1639
01:34:45,842 --> 01:34:50,074
- Do some of your rapping.
- Don't nobody want to hear none of that.

1640
01:34:50,147 --> 01:34:52,081
Believe me, baby, with that body...

1641
01:34:52,149 --> 01:34:54,379
we want to hear
anything you got to sing.

1642
01:34:54,451 --> 01:34:56,442
- All right.
- What the hell are you doing?

1643
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:58,681
¢Ü I was never one
to ask for help ¢Ü

1644
01:34:58,755 --> 01:35:01,883
¢Ü And I'm from where niggas
keep more guns on their waists than belts ¢Ü

1645
01:35:01,958 --> 01:35:05,257
¢Ü You get shot, skip the ambulance
Straight to death ¢Ü

1646
01:35:05,328 --> 01:35:07,558
¢Ü I fire rounds till there
ain't shit left ¢Ü¢Ü

1647
01:35:07,631 --> 01:35:11,123
<i>Whoo! Well, okay!
There ain't shit left. That was good.</i>

1648
01:35:11,201 --> 01:35:14,102
Ain't shit left! Hey.

1649
01:35:14,171 --> 01:35:17,140
You know,
I once thought about a career in rap.

1650
01:35:17,207 --> 01:35:19,175
<i>[Chuckles]</i>

1651
01:35:19,242 --> 01:35:21,904
Oh, bless your heart.

1652
01:35:21,978 --> 01:35:25,971
Ryan helped me with my dance tryout
the other day. He's really talented.

1653
01:35:26,049 --> 01:35:29,610
I'm sorry, honey. I didn't get your name.
You are who again?

1654
01:35:29,686 --> 01:35:32,678
- This is my friend Ryan.
- Friend, you say?

1655
01:35:32,756 --> 01:35:35,657
Mm-hmm.
Well, if I remember, at the picnic-

1656
01:35:35,726 --> 01:35:38,286
Sheldon, you know, you don't
even have to explain.

1657
01:35:38,361 --> 01:35:40,693
You know what, Jackie?
It's- It's okay.

1658
01:35:41,865 --> 01:35:43,958
Ryan is my partner.

1659
01:35:44,034 --> 01:35:46,594
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

1660
01:35:46,670 --> 01:35:48,661
This sure is modern.

1661
01:35:48,739 --> 01:35:50,707
<i>[Laughing]</i>

1662
01:35:50,774 --> 01:35:53,299
Evelyn, I don't know how you do it.
Oh, no, honey.

1663
01:35:53,376 --> 01:35:56,072
<i>You a better woman
than I'll ever be.</i>

1664
01:35:56,146 --> 01:35:59,206
Raise these kids, and they run around
and do all kind of things.

1665
01:35:59,282 --> 01:36:03,378
<i>Living all types of lives
in all types of places.</i>

1666
01:36:03,453 --> 01:36:06,013

01:36:06,089 --> 01:36:10,116
Bless your heart.
Bless your heart.

1668
01:36:10,193 --> 01:36:14,152
What I want to know is, uh,
how is little Gabriel takin' all this?

1669
01:36:15,899 --> 01:36:18,299
- I'm fine.
- That's enough, Lettuce.

1670
01:36:18,368 --> 01:36:20,233
I'm just concerned
about the child, Jimmy.

1671
01:36:20,303 --> 01:36:22,999
You know what?
You don't have to worry about anything.

1672
01:36:23,073 --> 01:36:25,303
And my son is doing fine.

1673
01:36:25,375 --> 01:36:29,038
<i>Well, I would just hate to see
you do what your daddy did.</i>

1674
01:36:29,112 --> 01:36:31,672
- Excuse me?
- Quiet as it's kept.

1675
01:36:31,748 --> 01:36:35,309
I never thought he was good enough
to be in this family anyway.

1676
01:36:35,385 --> 01:36:38,843
He weren't ever around.
You weren't ever around.

1677
01:36:38,922 --> 01:36:42,585
You know, Lettie, you are
the worst part of family.

1678
01:36:42,659 --> 01:36:44,627
Evelyn, I'm just being honest.

1679
01:36:44,694 --> 01:36:49,324
And sometimes honesty can
be a hard thing to take.

1680
01:36:49,399 --> 01:36:52,698
It's no wonder I'm the way I am.
You're just like Mama was.

1681
01:36:52,769 --> 01:36:55,101
Don't bring Mama into this, Evelyn.

1682
01:36:55,172 --> 01:36:57,436
Mama was a saint.
Her and daddy too.

1683
01:36:57,507 --> 01:37:01,603
Oh, please. The both of'em,
they ran me to the bottle and you to ho'in'.

01:37:05,582 --> 01:37:09,279
Oh, girl.

<i>I ain't gonna start.
You-You-</i>

1688
01:37:13,356 --> 01:37:16,382
This is supposed to be a family dinner,
and we gonna do this right.

1689
01:37:16,459 --> 01:37:18,654
<i>Well, this ain't Soul Food,
and we ain't the Cosbys.</i>

1690
01:37:18,728 --> 01:37:22,186
I am not gonna sit here,
let you tear everybody down at this table...

1691
01:37:22,265 --> 01:37:24,256
and then act like it's okay.

1692
01:37:24,334 --> 01:37:27,770
Well, it looks like you doin' a good job
of tearing everybody down yourself.

1693
01:37:27,838 --> 01:37:30,432
This is supposed to be
a pleasant dinner.

1694
01:37:30,507 --> 01:37:33,408
We're all here because Sheldon
is leaving tomorrow, okay?

1695
01:37:34,811 --> 01:37:37,609
- [Chuckles] You leaving?
- Well-

1696
01:37:37,681 --> 01:37:40,081
- Ain't nobody going nowhere!
- That's what I'm trying to-

1697
01:37:40,150 --> 01:37:41,549
- Shut up!
- What?

1698
01:37:41,618 --> 01:37:43,779
I didn't mean "shut up" shut up.
I mean just shut up!

1699
01:37:43,854 --> 01:37:47,722
Look at her, always trying to tell somebody
what to do with her fat ass.

1700
01:37:47,791 --> 01:37:49,725
You call me fat again...

1701
01:37:49,793 --> 01:37:52,990
and I'm gonna go upside your big
hat-wearing head with a biscuit.

1702
01:37:54,331 --> 01:37:56,731
Now, look here, Jackie, Eugene...

1703
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,734
Abby.

1704
01:37:58,802 --> 01:38:01,204
You know I ain't perfect.

1705
01:38:01,337 --> 01:38:03,999
I'm stubborn...

1706
01:38:04,073 --> 01:38:07,065
ornery, opinionated sometimes.

1707
01:38:07,143 --> 01:38:08,508
- Mean-spirited.
- Insulting.

1708
01:38:08,578 --> 01:38:11,672
- Inflexible.
- All right, all right! I get it!

1709
01:38:11,747 --> 01:38:16,184
But in my own way,
all I have ever tried to do...

1710
01:38:16,252 --> 01:38:20,245
was to make this
the best family I knew how.

1711
01:38:20,323 --> 01:38:23,156
And that meant sometimes
I may say things or do things...

1712
01:38:23,226 --> 01:38:25,717
that, well, when I
think back on it now...

1713
01:38:25,795 --> 01:38:28,696
I guess, l- I'm not proud of.

1714
01:38:28,764 --> 01:38:30,925
- Mama.
- Jackie.

1715
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,663
<i>I know you plan on leavin'.</i>

01:38:34,737 --> 01:38:38,298
You done found some opportunity to go
somewhere and make something out of your life.

1717
01:38:38,374 --> 01:38:41,036
But what you don't know is
that I've been pushin' you.

1718
01:38:41,911 --> 01:38:44,573
Pushin', pushin', pushin'.

1719
01:38:44,647 --> 01:38:46,638

<i>[Laughs]

01:38:49,885 --> 01:38:52,285
- I am not drunk!
- Mama?

1722
01:38:52,355 --> 01:38:54,653
Maybe I am.

1723
01:38:54,724 --> 01:38:59,286
That don't have nothing to do or change
anything that I got to say right here and right now.

1724
01:38:59,362 --> 01:39:02,490
Evelyn, what are you trying to say?

1725
01:39:02,565 --> 01:39:04,658
I'm saying I can't
stand you, Lettie!

1726
01:39:04,734 --> 01:39:08,067
<i>You have been horrible to me
ever since I was a child!</i>

1727
01:39:08,137 --> 01:39:11,265
<i>But it's because Mama
was horrible to you!</i>

1728
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:15,743
<i>I had my kids, I was horrible to them!
It's that Lion King shit.</i>

1729
01:39:15,811 --> 01:39:18,211
The circle- circle of life.

1730
01:39:18,281 --> 01:39:21,682

- What she need is Jesus.

I'm sorry for all
the years of pain I caused you.

1737

<i>I'm sorry for not
being there for you.</i>

1738
01:39:42,972 --> 01:39:47,671
I'm sorry that I never just opened up my arms
and hold you tight.

1739
01:39:47,743 --> 01:39:51,577
- Mama-
- And I just wanted to be able to take this time...

Thank you.

<i>And you were so sweet

- Oh, queer as a three-dollar bill.

Queer. Queer. Queer as

That's it.

1758
01:40:53,509 --> 01:40:57,001
But it's okay, Sheldon. It is okay.
You can tell the whole world you gay.

1759

Don't you hide yourself
from nobody...

Be proud of yourself.

we're gonna stay in Paris.
