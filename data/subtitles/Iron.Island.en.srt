00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,920
Wait.

5
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,920
I RON ISLAND

6
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,160
It's old,

7
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,240
but it's in good shape.

8
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,160
The rent is reasonable too.

9
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,680
It comes with everything.

10
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,080
See.

11
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,320
It stands like a rock.

12
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,680
Meraj!

13
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,480
Give me that megaphone.

14
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,200
Here you go, Captain.

15
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,280
Meraj!

16
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,440
Where the hell are you?

17
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,760
LoWer the lift!

18
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,520
Hey, Meraj!

19
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,280
Let go!

20
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,320
What's the matter?

21
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,920
What's wrong with you assholes?

22
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,400
Fighting like animals.

23
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,680
This bastard wrote to my sister.

24
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,320
He's lying, I didn't.

25
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,520
You've fucked up... and you too.

26
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,240
Haven't I told you
to stay away from this girl?

27
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,080
If I catch you fighting
one more time

28
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,400
I'll throw you in the sea.

29
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,480
Go home.

30
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,240
Get to your work!

31
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,360
Hurry up. Let's go!

32
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,720
Meraj, I've told you
not to leave the lift!

33
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,120
Go get the people down there.

34
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,000
Tell the guy to use the ladder. Hurry.

35
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,800
What is it?

36
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,360
Put your shoes on.

37
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,600
Make some tea.

38
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,080
Kid, I've told you a hundred times
that girl isn't right for you.

39
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,120
You don't have anyone.

40
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,160
God knows where
you would've ended up

41
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,040
if I hadn't brought you here.

42
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,120
I put you to work
to earn some money.

43
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,800
To make something of yourself.

44
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,080
She's engaged.

45
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,360
Her dad's very protective.

46
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,120
When he gets back from the sea,

47
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,440
he'll put you in your place.

48
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,400
He wants to marry off his daughter

49
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,640
to have one less mouth to feed,

50
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,840
not to add another one.

51
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,040
I have a job... an income.

52
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,440
You call this a job?

53
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,560
An income?

54
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,040
- Who's her fiancé?
- Never you mind.

55
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,120
- She wants to marry me.
- You both fucked up!

56
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,680
Captain Nemat, they're here.

57
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,840
Hurry up and get this phone working.
People are waiting.

58
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,440
- Hello, Captain.
- Hello there.

59
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,160
- How many children do you have?
- Six, Captain.

60
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,440
Great. May God protect them.
Big family.

61
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,840
- That's life, Captain.
- Stay here.

62
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,760
Look out, girl. Be careful.

63
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,080
- Hello, Captain.
- Hello there.

64
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,920
- Stay here with us.
- Yes, yes.

65
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,480
I'll give you a job
here on the ship.

66
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,640
You'll go to work in the morning,
come home after sunset. How's that?

67
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,920
Hello, Captain.

68
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,600
Hello, Haj Khanoom.
You got rid of the bakery?

69
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,960
- I don't have any flour.
- What do you do with it all?

70
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,040
You keep bringing in new tenants.
So, I bake more.

71
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,520
That's fine, stop whining.
I'll get you more flour.

72
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,120
Thank you, Captain.

73
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,400
No more payments due.

74
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,600
We're even now.

75
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,440
Hey, kid, look out.
Watch your step.

76
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,720
All your kids are girls too.
You have to find husbands for them.

77
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,600
If you stay here
I'll find them good husbands.

78
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,960
Not those penniless punks.
Suitable husbands!

79
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,240
I'll get good prices for you.

80
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,800
Everything's in order here.

81
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,840
They'll live a happy life together.

82
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,760
How much is the rent, Captain?

83
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,480
No rent, my dear sir.

84
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,080
Anything we charge

85
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,320
is spent on the ship and
it's deducted from your salary.

86
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,600
I'll show you what you need to do

87
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,840
and teach you how to do it.

88
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,400
- Hi, Uncle Sadegh.
- Hi there, Captain.

89
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,120
- How are you, Uncle?
- I'm fine.

90
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,000
What do all animals need

91
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,800
in order to breathe?

92
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,680
They need air.

93
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,640
Second graders, be quiet.

94
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,440
First graders, tell me how many syllables.

95
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,120
Two syllables.

96
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,280
- The first syllable?
- Dosh...

97
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,040
- The second syllable?
- Man.

98
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,080
Read it.

99
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,000
D... o... sh...

100
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,240
ma... n.
(enemy)

101
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,320
Uncle,

102
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,120
I'd like to go to war
and fight the enemy.

103
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,080
Pay attention.

104
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,160
The war has long ended.

105
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,680
You mean there'll be no more wars?

106
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,800
Pay attention, students.

107
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,120
War isn't a good thing.

108
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,280
May there never be a war
anywhere in the world.

109
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,200
My dad told me
we have to kill the enemy.

110
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,240
Uncle, where is the world?

111
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,920
Where we are now
is part of the world.

112
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,200
So, we're in the world.

113
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,080
Uncle, but this is an oil tanker.

114
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,600
Pay attention, students.

115
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,840
We're inside the ship,
the ship is in the sea,

116
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,680
and the sea is in the world.

117
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,880
So, we're all in the world.

118
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,120
- Understand?
- Yes.

119
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,160
Uncle, my dad lost his leg in the war.

120
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,960
Uncle, who's the enemy?

121
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,600
You can relax.
Everything's at hand.

122
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,160
- Hello, Captain.
- Hello there.

123
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,840
Hello, teacher.

124
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,920
Please.
This is the classroom.

125
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,240
The kids can start right away.

126
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,560
Education is more necessary
to them than food.

127
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,760
I've brought you
four wonderful students.

128
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,560
Here's the paper.

129
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,960
Thanks, but the school
is getting very crowded.

130
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,000
Praise the Lord.
Thank God for that.

131
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,600
This teacher is truly kind.

132
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,680
A hard worker.

133
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,280
You're kind. Thank you.

134
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,400
So, I'll leave these
students with you.

135
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,480
These are old newspapers again.

136
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,960
Abdolkarim, what's the difference?
Just read it for fun.

137
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,120
Let's go, my dear sir.

138
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,400
Bye for now.

139
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,600
- I need to talk to you, Captain.
- Okay, fine.

140
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,600
- It's important.
- Do come and see me.

141
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,920
I'll come to see you.

142
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,480
- It's important. I have to see you.
- Okay, fine.

143
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,480
Can you read or write?

144
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,160
How about you?

145
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,440
And you?

146
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,080
You?

147
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,280
I need to speak to Private Mohammad.

148
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,360
Yes, his wife wants to speak to him.

149
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,760
Hi, Mohammad, how are you?

150
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,760
Hold on, hold on.

151
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,320
Hi. How are you?

152
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,200
She's fine too.
I'm holding her.

153
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,120
Your mom's fine too.
Everyone says hello.

154
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,160
I've got you some dates.

155
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,880
When are you coming?

156
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,280
The Captain looks after us.

157
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,960
Okay, okay.
I'm waiting for you.

158
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,400
Bye.

159
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,960
Thank you.

160
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,800
- Should I put it on your account?
- Yes.

161
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,120
Next.

162
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,800
Dial this number for me.

163
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,200
Make up your mind.

164
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,080
I only have this one room.

165
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,280
It belonged to a guy
who used to work here.

166
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,240
He made good money,
set up his own house.

167
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,160
Now he's living a comfortable life.

168
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,800
- Here you go. This is it.
- Thank you.

169
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,560
I'll have them give you
a large carton,

170
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,520
so you can make a divider.

171
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,360
Clean it up,
put a carpet here

172
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,080
and live a lifetime of comfort.

173
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,800
Hello there.

174
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,560
How are you?

175
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,640
Here are your new neighbors.

176
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,320
They can give you anything
you need for the cleaning.

177
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,520
They're good people.
They look out for each other.

178
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,000
I'll take care of your job right away.
Now get on with your life.

179
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,920
Send some money.

180
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,840
I have no money.

181
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,480
I got cut off. Dial again.

182
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,800
He got the message.
He has to send money.

183
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,080
- Put it on my account.
- I can't.

184
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,320
You owe me money.

185
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,960
I don't have any.

186
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,160
I don't care. You owe a lot.

187
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,680
I have no money.

188
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,680
- What'll I tell the Captain?
- I'll talk to him.

189
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,240
- Right, you talk to him.
- Yes, yes.

190
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,200
Next person.

191
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,240
Dial this number.

192
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,720
Hi.

193
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,760
Is this Captain Abdallah's raft?

194
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,000
I want to speak to Issah.

195
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,800
I'm his son.

196
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,640
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi there.

197
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,000
- I need to change the oil.
- So, do it.

198
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,720
- We have no oil.
- I'll send you some.

199
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,360
Hello there.

200
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,280
Hello there.
God bless you.

201
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,960
Hi, Bibi Khanoom.
How are you?

202
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,560
In pain.

203
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,160
Is it your knee?

204
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,200
Use this ointment every night.
It'll take care of it.

205
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,800
- Here you go. Bye.
- Thank you.

206
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,600
God willing, you'll get better.

207
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,080
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi there.

208
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,120
Do something, Captain.
We have no oil.

209
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,000
- Oil?
- We have no lamps.

210
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,840
I'll have them bring you some
from the reservoir.

211
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,320
Thanks.

212
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,120
Bye.

213
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,840
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi.

214
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,960
These burkas are ready.

215
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,360
- How many are there?
- Eight.

216
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,600
- Should I put it on your account?
- Yes, please.

217
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,320
Fine, eight burkas

218
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,080
for Mrs. Ommalbani.

219
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,560
Hi, Captain.

220
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,880
Hi there.

221
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,200
Does she still have a fever?

222
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,240
- Is she feeling any better?
- No, Captain.

223
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,760
- How about yourself?
- Thank you. I'm okay.

224
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,400
- Any news from your husband?
- No news.

225
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,960
It's been eight months now.

226
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,520
I'll give you to your mom.
Calm down.

227
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,000
God willing, he'll come back
one of these days with good news.

228
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,120
Thank you.

229
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,640
Be careful,
you're about to give birth.

230
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,120
Give her one of these pills
every morning

231
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,080
and a spoon of this syrup every night
before she goes to sleep.

232
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,440
Good. She's quiet now.

233
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,560
Thanks, you've calmed her down.

234
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,960
I'll put it on your account.

235
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,560
I'm so grateful.

236
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,800
Bye.

237
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,480
- Hi.
- Hi there.

238
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,760
- Kid, why aren't you at school?
- He's sick.

239
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,160
Sick? Kids have to go to school.

240
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,280
- God willing, he'll go tomorrow.
- Make sure he does.

241
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,560
- Hi, Captain Nemat.
- Hi, Uncle Abdolkarim.

242
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,280
Wait, Captain.

243
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,800
I need to talk to you.

244
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,560
You've probably
invented something again.

245
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,320
You better see it up close.

246
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,920
Come with me, Captain.

247
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,320
- What's this?
- The machine I've designed.

248
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,520
One end of this rope's tied
to a float in the sea.

249
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,160
The other end is tied to this weight.

250
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,680
As the float rises,
the weight will drop.

251
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,920
When does it rise?
When the ship sinks in the water.

252
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,160
The ship's sunk this much
over the last two months.

253
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,400
What do you think?

254
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,080
You've said for years
the ship's sinking.

255
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,360
We haven't seen a thing.

256
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,280
Thank God, this ship is
still standing like a rock.

257
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,600
It's sunk two meters
since a few years ago,

258
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,160
but it can't be seen
with the naked eye.

259
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,680
Give me a break.

260
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,440
When the tide is low, eight meters
of the ship is out of the water.

261
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,800
You say it's sunk two meters
in the last few years.

262
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,040
Who cares what happens
in a hundred years?

263
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,480
Captain Nemat,

264
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,680
if this continues, the ship will sink.

265
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,400
Instead of having
these negative thoughts

266
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,960
and the nonsense that you put
in poor children's heads,

267
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,840
you should think of
something useful,

268
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,640
something that would make
them successful in the future.

269
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,400
Captain Nemat
to the Phone Company.

270
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,600
- Captain, they're calling you.
- Who is it?

271
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,680
Hello there.

272
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,120
You shouldn't have called me here.

273
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,240
I told you that I'd contact you myself.

274
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,400
What do you mean
it doesn't concern me?

275
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,240
No, I can't do this.

276
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,160
What do you mean?
Where the hell should I tell them to go?

277
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,480
You're forcing me.

278
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,760
I said this six months ago,
I said it two months ago,

279
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,080
and I'm telling you now.

280
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,640
What's in it for these people?

281
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,160
Will you give them a place to sleep?
A piece of land?

282
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,480
Do you have any idea
what will happen to them?

283
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,760
No, sir. I can't.
No, it can't be done.

284
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,320
Then go and talk to the people
you bought it from.

285
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,440
You don't care what
will happen to these people?

286
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,360
All you think of
is your end of the deal.

287
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,280
I won't do this.

288
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,000
I won't evacuate this ship.

289
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,040
And you can't do anything about it.
Do whatever you want.

290
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,760
Akbar!

291
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,760
Where are you?

292
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,640
Get over here.

293
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,360
How's it going?

294
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,160
We're having a problem.
The steel's too thick.

295
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,120
Hurry up.
You're wasting time.

296
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,320
Move the ones you've
already taken apart on deck.

297
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,280
Here, this is for the guys.
It's for this week.

298
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,360
I've deducted what they owed.

299
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,520
Sign here.

300
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,400
Hurry up. There's no time.
Hurry. Let's go.

301
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,040
Move it. Hurry!

302
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,160
Akbar!

303
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,600
Uncle Sadegh, what do you see
in the sun? I can't see a thing.

304
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,840
I've been looking for years in vain.

305
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,560
And you want to see
something in five minutes!

306
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,360
Don't move away
from the lift, understood?

307
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,560
From sunrise to sunset.

308
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,520
Men use the ladder.
Women and children use the lift.

309
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,800
Got it?

310
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,480
Good.

311
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,960
Have you told them
to shut off the generator?

312
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,720
Yes, Captain. I have.

313
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,880
Lower the lift. Go ahead.

314
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,040
At 9::30 p.m.,

315
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,560
the generator Will be shut off.

316
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,520
Get your I Ds ready.
I Ds. Get them ready.

317
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,040
Hurry, get your I Ds ready.

318
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,000
- What for?
- The Captain needs them.

319
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,520
- What for?
- To get green cards.

320
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,760
We already have ours.

321
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,920
The Captain knows people.
He can get as many as he wants.

322
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,280
He'll sell them and deduct it
from your rent, okay?

323
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,160
- Maybe he should get it himself.
- Okay, wait.

324
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,080
I Ds. Get them ready.

325
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,040
Get your I Ds ready.

326
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,360
It'll get there.
Just wait a bit.

327
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,960
Okay, okay.

328
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,520
It'll be there in one or two days.

329
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,040
All right, okay.

330
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,560
It was the asphalt makers.
Hurry up.

331
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,920
Yes, Captain.
I'll tell Akbar.

332
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,400
- Counted them?
- Yes.

333
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,240
I got the new neighbors' I Ds, too.

334
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,360
Go and hide yourself somewhere.

335
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,040
If he finds you, he'll kill you.

336
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,400
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi there.

337
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,560
Welcome back.
How was the sea?

338
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,560
I had a phone call.
Was there a problem here?

339
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,680
They probably just wanted to say hi.

340
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,720
Hi. How are you?

341
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,320
Bye, Captain.

342
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,120
How are you, Baby Fish?

343
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,960
There are no fish here.

344
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,240
From the sea. They come in
through that hole in the corner

345
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,360
and they can't get back...

346
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,280
to the sea.

347
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,600
Ah, it got away.

348
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,840
Give me your net, I'll help you.

349
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,600
Here you go.

350
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,680
Father,

351
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,520
please forgive me!

352
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,880
Let her go!

353
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,280
My honor's at stake. Go inside.

354
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,560
I didn't raise my daughter
to dishonor me.

355
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,000
Let her go.
Have mercy on her.

356
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,680
Leave me alone.
What is it to you?

357
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,280
She's my daughter!

358
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,960
I'll kill her if I want to!

359
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,080
You bastard!

360
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,680
Come out, you filthy bastard!

361
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,520
I'll find you!

362
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,560
We listen to everything you say.
You know that, Captain.

363
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,920
I come here once
every two weeks.

364
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,000
I'm at sea all the time,
working like a slave.

365
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,040
Take these away.

366
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,920
I told you not to leave her like this.

367
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,960
Marry her off.

368
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,040
The guy I'm telling you about

369
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,280
is a decent man.

370
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,560
It's true that she'll be away,

371
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,360
but at least you'll know she's safe.

372
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,960
She's taken care of.

373
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,960
This guy has money.
He's dependable.

374
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,480
I'll get you something too.

375
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,400
Whatever you say.

376
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,280
I say, let her go.

377
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,120
This guy's a good man.
What do you say?

378
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,240
- Do you agree?
- Whatever's the will of God.

379
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,640
Shall I proceed?

380
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,040
You know best. I trust you.

381
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,560
But I'm leaving on a raft tomorrow.
I have to go to sea.

382
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,400
I want no embarrassment later on.
I want to be proud.

383
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,480
I guarantee that you'll be proud.

384
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,920
And your daughter will be settled down.

385
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,160
You can relax.
Don't worry a bit.

386
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,680
When you get back,
there's one less mouth to feed

387
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,040
and God willing,
you'll even gain something.

388
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,400
Meraj!

389
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,480
Go and rest assured.

390
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,120
Hey, Meraj!

391
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,240
Come and lower the lift.

392
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,120
It's 9::30 p.m.

393
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,160
The generator Will be shut off.

394
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,680
Should I hand you over to her father?

395
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,080
Should I?

396
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,240
Or maybe I should beat
the hell out of you myself!

397
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,040
This is the end, Ahmad.

398
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,280
Yesterday when he left,

399
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,480
he asked me to look after her
in his absence.

400
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,920
I swear to God,

401
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,680
if you mess things up one more time

402
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,160
or set your foot
where it shouldn't go,

403
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,200
I'll kill you, and the seagulls
will fly over your grave.

404
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,600
Understood?

405
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,560
The key.

406
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,240
Now go downstairs.

407
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,480
Tell Akbar that
the Captain has sent you.

408
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,480
He knows what to do,

409
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,400
and you'll obey him.

410
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,600
Go!

411
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,600
You can't come aboard, sir.

412
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,120
I'm responsible. I just can't.

413
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,920
Go call the Captain.

414
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,280
He's not here.

415
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,480
Look, we have an official notice.

416
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,200
You shouldn't resist.

417
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,440
I don't knoW.
Come back tomorroW

418
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,360
When the Captain is here.

419
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,800
Let us come up.

420
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,040
We'll do our job and then leave.

421
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,360
And what is your job?

422
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,000
- Are you Captain Nemat?
- Yes, I am.

423
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,360
- Hello.
- Hello there.

424
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,160
We have an official
evacuation notice for the ship.

425
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,120
Evacuation?

426
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,600
You think you can just throw us out?

427
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,760
Where do you think you're going?

428
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,120
I'll explain to you when I get up there.

429
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,520
Wait. I won't allow this.

430
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,600
Hey, people!

431
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,760
They Want to throWyou
out of your home!

432
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,440
Come and defend yourselves!

433
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,560
The sea

434
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,480
is beautiful

435
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,040
and spectacular.

436
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,000
The ship

437
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,480
is in the sea.

438
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,120
The ship...

439
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,560
sinks more...

440
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,080
in the sea every day.

441
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,960
Life...

442
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,480
in the ship...

443
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,600
is beautiful.

444
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,640
- Did you write it down?
- Yes.

445
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,000
I've already told you.

446
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,200
No, it can't be done.

447
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,240
What?

448
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,240
You're going to use force?

449
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,560
Go ahead. Do it.

450
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,280
Listen, listen.

451
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,760
You can bring a tank.

452
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,960
You can use a rocket if you want.

453
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,200
Look, these people need homes.

454
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,760
They want a life.

455
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,560
Their children were born here,
they grew up here.

456
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,320
You expect them to leave just like that?
No rights, no nothing.

457
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,280
That's fine. You're welcome.

458
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,080
We have nothing to talk about.

459
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,640
Listen, they can call a meeting
when they have something to discuss.

460
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,960
We have nothing to discuss.

461
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,400
Okay, I'll come.
We can have a cup of tea.

462
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,080
But tea won't resolve our problem.

463
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,080
Okay, okay. I'll come.
I'll definitely come.

464
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,000
Good-bye.

465
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,120
Get closer to the lift.

466
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,360
I'm watering my flower,
my dear flower.

467
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,680
I'll teach it patience.

468
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,960
No one has watered it.

469
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,640
That's why it's gone dry.

470
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,960
Hi, UncleJalal.

471
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,760
Hi, Baby Fish.

472
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,160
- How are you?
- Fine.

473
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:45,440
- How many fish have you got?
- I don't know. Probably 10 or 20.

474
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,920
Your goat given birth yet?

475
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,840
No, she hasn't. One of these days.

476
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,040
Hi, Uncle Sadegh.

477
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,600
Hi, Baby Fish.

478
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,360
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

479
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,280
- Seen what you wanted to see?
- I haven't found anything yet.

480
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,920
God willing, I'll soon find it.

481
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,560
What's up, Akbar?

482
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,320
Stop, stop!

483
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,760
The damn thing
has broken the drill.

484
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,640
But I think it'll work.

485
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,000
I hope it's the right place.

486
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,320
Go, pour some water.

487
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,440
More.

488
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,840
Akbar!

489
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,320
- What happened?
- It's done, Captain.

490
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,720
Hassan, switch on the pump.

491
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,920
Switch it on!

492
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,840
Switch the pump on.

493
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,400
It's working, Akbar. It's working.

494
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,280
Move it. Let's get the barrels.

495
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,560
"The aggressive nature
of the enemy and our duties.

496
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,560
Our world is a world of phenomena
and in facing any phenomena,

497
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,400
we have to get to know it first.

498
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,360
Meaning we have to know

499
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,560
the key elements
of its nature and its goals."

500
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,800
That's good.
Give it to the next person.

501
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,240
"We then have to discover

502
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,320
ways of resisting it,
based on a precise methed..."

503
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,120
Not "methed" - "method".
Give it to the next person. Next.

504
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,000
"Floods are one of
the destructive phenomena

505
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,120
which have to be handled."

506
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,720
All rise.

507
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,440
- Hi.
- Hi.

508
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,600
Sorry, teacher, we have to
end the class. Kids, follow me.

509
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,160
They have a class, lessons to learn.

510
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,280
Where are they going?

511
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,760
This is a class.

512
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,760
Fill the barrels half way.
Half way!

513
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,000
No more, no less.

514
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,160
That's enough. That's half.

515
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,520
Pull it up!

516
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,200
Everyone ready.

517
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,520
Parviz.

518
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:46,240
Hurry up, kids. Quick.
Let's go.

519
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,800
Do something!
I can't deliver the baby!

520
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
We have to take her to a hospital!

521
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:55,200
Ali Mansour,
turn on the generator!

522
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,400
Wait, her husband's not here.
Put the burka on her face.

523
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,480
God, please help me.

524
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:39,080
God, do you hear my cry?

525
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,120
What is this?

526
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,120
What are you doing?

527
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,320
You worthless losers!

528
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,760
You have no shame?

529
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:30,200
The ship is in the sea.

530
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,360
The sea is vast.

531
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,240
The sea is beautiful

532
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,400
and spectacular.

533
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,800
Did you write it down?

534
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,440
- Hi.
- Hello.

535
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:12,160
I want to see Mr. Razequinia.

536
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,640
Which one?

537
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:17,440
I don't know. The one who's
in the ship scrapping business.

538
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,040
They're all in that business.

539
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,040
You probably need to see someone
in charge of acquisitions.

540
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,400
Go and make a U-turn,

541
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:30,600
take the coastal road
and after 20 kilometers, make a right.

542
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,760
There you can ask anyone
for the breaker's yard.

543
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,120
You can find him there.

544
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,280
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

545
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,960
I'm looking for Mr. Razequinia.

546
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,240
Over there.

547
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,960
Be careful, careful.
Go ahead, move.

548
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,280
When you're done here,
go and cut up that pipe too.

549
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,560
Hey Parviz.
Hey, Moslem.

550
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,560
Be careful With the steel parts.
Don't play around.

551
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:14,640
HoWmany times must I tell you
not to drop them in the Water?

552
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,280
- Hi.
- Hi.

553
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:45,880
- Is Captain Nemat here?
- No. Can I help you?

554
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,880
I've got some stuff for him.

555
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,280
Right. He told me something about it.

556
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,520
Wait here.

557
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:52,880
No problem.

558
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,320
Ali, Ahmad, take the stuff
from the pickup truck and put it

559
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,800
in the boat.

560
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,840
What's all this stuff for?

561
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,280
A wedding.

562
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,960
But this is a classroom,
the students will be here.

563
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:44,040
There's no room for them.

564
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,520
Where should I put 'em?
I can't put 'em in the cabins.

565
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,360
Meraj, lower the lift.

566
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,320
Hi, Captain.

567
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,920
Hi there.

568
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:45,800
Anything else, Captain?

569
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,120
Thanks.
I hope I can return your kindness.

570
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,720
Good-bye, Captain.

571
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,560
Let me know
if you need anything.

572
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,240
Is this what I get for all my kindness?

573
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,440
You steal my boat.

574
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,800
Where in the sea did you want to go?

575
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,640
Say you've fucked up.

576
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,760
Forgive him. He's young.
Let him go.

577
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:59,520
If I let him go,
there'll be chaos on this ship.

578
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,800
I fucked up!

579
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,360
I'm sorry, Captain!
For God's sake!

580
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:38,400
I fucked up!

581
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:43,880
Please, Captain!

582
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,000
I'm sorry.

583
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,960
We'll give the ship

584
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:16,520
so We can get ourselves some land.

585
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,720
We Want to live on dry land.

586
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,040
As the teacher says,

587
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,680
this ship's sinking every day.

588
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:29,000
We have to leave as quickly as possible.

589
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,880
I Want you to help each other

590
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:35,480
so We can build a toWn on dry land.

591
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,640
A toWn...

592
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,360
With a house

593
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,840
for each one of you.

594
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,080
We Won't let go of each other.

595
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,360
We're used to one another.

596
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:49,880
You all have to give me

597
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,480

There are still some problems,
but they can be solved.

01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,240
Theyjust need folloWing up.

601

You can go.

604
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,880
Attention, residents!

I'm going to get it
notarized immediately.

618
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,040
Yes, sir.

619
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,520
They can come
tomorrow morning at 10:00

620
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:11,400
to collect it completely.

621
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,920
Yes.

622
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:16,080
Everybody has agreed.
All of them, yes.

623
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,560
Uncle Sadegh, come down.

624
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,600
I won't! What do you want?

625
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,560
You're wasting our time.
Come down!

626
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,160
I won't come down.

627
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,000
You can leave if you want.

628
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,480
We're all going on a pilgrimage

629
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,800
to Shah-e-Shahid.
There's a sun over there too.

630
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,200
Women and children, use the lift.

631
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,640
Men, use the ladder.

632
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:49,360
AmooJalal, Where are you
taking that goat? Take it back.

633
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:04,600
The boats that are full can leave.

634
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,960
What are you doing here, kid?

635
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:55,960
Come on up.
Why didn't you leave with the rest?

636
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:58,760
- I was fishing.
- Fishing?

637
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:00,920
What are these?

638
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,600
Why did you do that?

639
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,840
Poor fish.

640
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:13,600
Let them grow bigger,
and then we'll catch them and eat them.

641
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:26,400
Attend the pilgrimage.
Gather for the pilgrimage.

642
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,920
Pray for the lands.

643
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:36,200
Attend the pilgrimage.
Please go ahead.

644
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:46,360
Welcome.
Isn't Mr. Hachemnia coming?

645
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,960
No. We're here to collect the ship.

646
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,720
What about the check and the rest?

647
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,720
We have it. We'll inspect the ship.

648
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:58,760
After drafting an inventory,
we'll be at your service.

649
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:01,120
Are there any people here?

650
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:04,000
No, they're all gone, evacuated.

651
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:04,680
Here are the official
power of attorney papers.

652
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:09,440
It's all in order.
Give him the check.

653
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:12,360
- There you go.
- Good-bye.

654
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:13,960
Take care.

655
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,160
Come here, kid. Come.

656
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:24,520
I hope

657
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,560
all your prayers are heard.

658
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:27,880
Keep the faith.

659
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,880
Come on, let's go see the lands.

660
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,200
Hurry up, kid.

661
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,280
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi there.

662
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,600
Go on, kid. Hurry, we're late.

663
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,680
Hey, wait!

01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,680
Where are you going,

665
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,160
Let's go, we have no time.

666
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:40,200
Take her to the shrine.

667
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,120
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi there.

668
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,600

I took the money for you.

672
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:23,480
Thank God,
all the problems are solved.

673
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:27,880
This land that you're standing on

674

Will be yours one day.

675
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,920

a big park

684
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:01,280
for the kids to play in.
