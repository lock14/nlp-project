1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Meet local girls from Snapchat on 
DMhookup.com

2
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,980
Bloody kids.

3
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:11,091
How fastidious you've become,
Wormtail.

4
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:15,668
As I recall, you once called
the nearest gutter pipe home.

5
00:03:15,837 --> 00:03:21,036
Could it be that the task of nursing me
has become wearisome for you?

6
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:23,677
Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort.

7
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:25,106
I only meant...

8
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:28,248
...perhaps if we were to do it
without the boy.

9
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,816
No! The boy is everything!

10
00:03:30,985 --> 00:03:34,512
It cannot be done without him.
And it will be done.

11
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:37,351
Exactly as I said.

12
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:41,454
- I will not disappoint you, my Lord.
- Good.

13
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:44,689
First, gather our old comrades.

14
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:47,096
Send them a sign.

15
00:03:58,813 --> 00:04:02,305
Nagini tells me
the old Muggle caretaker...

16
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:06,180
...is standing just outside the door.

17
00:04:06,354 --> 00:04:11,656
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

18
00:04:11,826 --> 00:04:13,657
Avada Kedavra!

19
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,190
Harry.

20
00:04:20,935 --> 00:04:22,596
Harry!

21
00:04:23,905 --> 00:04:25,702
Are you all right?

22
00:04:26,407 --> 00:04:28,500
Hermione. Bad dream.

23
00:04:28,676 --> 00:04:32,043
- When did you get here?
- Just now. You?

24
00:04:32,213 --> 00:04:33,441
Last night.

25
00:04:33,614 --> 00:04:35,844
Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!

26
00:04:36,017 --> 00:04:37,279
Bloody hell.

27
00:04:37,452 --> 00:04:38,976
Honestly, get dressed.

28
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:41,450
And don't go back to sleep.

29
00:04:41,622 --> 00:04:44,955
Come on, Ron!
Your mother says breakfast's ready!

30
00:04:51,632 --> 00:04:54,465
- Ron, where are we actually going?
- Don't know.

31
00:04:54,936 --> 00:04:58,201
- Hey, Dad. Where are we going?
- Haven't the foggiest.

32
00:04:58,372 --> 00:04:59,896
Keep up!

33
00:05:02,477 --> 00:05:04,308
Arthur!

34
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,470
It's about time, son.

35
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:11,016
Sorry, Amos. Some of us
had a bit of a sleepy start.

36
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:16,851
This is Amos Diggory, everyone.
Works with me at the Ministry.

37
00:05:17,058 --> 00:05:19,549
And this strapping young lad
must be Cedric, am I right?

38
00:05:19,727 --> 00:05:20,887
Yes, sir.

39
00:05:21,062 --> 00:05:22,723
This way.

40
00:05:24,465 --> 00:05:27,832
Merlin's beard!
You must be Harry Potter.

41
00:05:28,002 --> 00:05:30,732
- Yes, sir.
- Great, great pleasure.

42
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:32,702
Pleasure to meet you too, sir.

43
00:05:35,343 --> 00:05:38,005
Yes, it's just over there.

44
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:42,078
- Shall we?
- Oh, yeah.

45
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,444
We don't want to be late.

46
00:05:43,618 --> 00:05:47,748
Come on. Nearly there now.
Get yourself into a good position.

47
00:05:48,756 --> 00:05:51,088
Why are they all standing around
that manky old boot?

48
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:53,750
- That isn't just any manky old boot.
- It's a Portkey.

49
00:05:53,928 --> 00:05:55,293
Time to go!

50
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:57,055
What's a Portkey?

51
00:05:57,231 --> 00:06:01,258
- Ready! After three. One, two...
- Harry!

52
00:06:01,435 --> 00:06:02,527
...three!

53
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,707
Let go, kids!

54
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:17,476
- What?!
- Let go!

55
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,090
I'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh?

56
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,635
- Total shambles, as per usual.
- Thanks.

57
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,569
Go on, look at that!

58
00:06:43,811 --> 00:06:48,339
Well, kids, welcome to
the Quidditch World Cup!

59
00:06:51,352 --> 00:06:53,980
Stay together! Keep up, girls!

60
00:06:55,523 --> 00:06:56,785
Look!

61
00:06:57,692 --> 00:06:59,956
Come on! Keep up, girls!

62
00:07:06,868 --> 00:07:08,267
Blimey!

63
00:07:08,436 --> 00:07:10,301
Parting of the ways, I think, old chap.

64
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,870
- See you at the match.
- See you.

65
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:13,336
- Cedric.
- Ced, come on.

66
00:07:13,507 --> 00:07:15,202
See you later, Cedric.

67
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,907
Home sweet home.

68
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:25,242
What?

69
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,560
- Excellent, excellent.
- Ginny, look!

70
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:36,026
- All to the bath.
- Look.

71
00:07:36,197 --> 00:07:38,688
Girls, choose a bunk and unpack.

72
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,734
Ron, get out of the kitchen.
We're all hungry.

73
00:07:41,903 --> 00:07:44,371
- Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron!
- Feet off the table!

74
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:46,802
- Feet off the table!
- Feet off the table!

75
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:50,237
I love magic.

76
00:08:05,493 --> 00:08:08,985
Get your Quidditch World Cup
programs here!

77
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,393
Blimey, Dad. How far up are we?

78
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:13,999
Well, put it this way:

79
00:08:14,235 --> 00:08:15,964
If it rains...

80
00:08:16,137 --> 00:08:18,503
...you'll be the first to know.

81
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,640
Father and I are in
the minister's box...

82
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:25,074
...by personal invitation
of Cornelius Fudge himself.

83
00:08:25,246 --> 00:08:27,441
Don't boast, Draco.

84
00:08:27,615 --> 00:08:29,708
There's no need with these people.

85
00:08:32,186 --> 00:08:34,711
Do enjoy yourself, won't you?

86
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:36,920
While you can.

87
00:08:50,338 --> 00:08:55,002
Come on up. Take your seats. I told you
these seats would be worth waiting for.

88
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:57,041
Come on!

89
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,248
It's the Irish! There's Troy!

90
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,246
- And Mullet!
- And Moran!

91
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,824
Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!

92
00:09:16,063 --> 00:09:19,260
- Here come the Bulgarians!
- Yes!

93
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:26,704
Who's that?

94
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,501
That, sis, is the best Seeker
in the world.

95
00:09:32,546 --> 00:09:36,073
Krum! Krum! Krum!

96
00:09:40,821 --> 00:09:42,049
Krum!

97
00:09:42,223 --> 00:09:43,952
Yes!

98
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:53,599
Good evening!

99
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,127
As Minister for Magic...

100
00:09:57,371 --> 00:10:00,397
...it gives me great pleasure...

101
00:10:01,008 --> 00:10:04,774
...to welcome
each and every one of you...

102
00:10:04,945 --> 00:10:10,815
...to the final
of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!

103
00:10:11,452 --> 00:10:12,817
Let the match...

104
00:10:13,187 --> 00:10:14,779
...begin!

105
00:10:20,928 --> 00:10:23,089
Krum! Krum! Krum!

106
00:10:30,938 --> 00:10:32,599
There's no one like Krum.

107
00:10:32,773 --> 00:10:34,365
- Krum?
- Dumb Krum?

108
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:37,602
He's like a bird,
the way he rides the wind.

109
00:10:37,778 --> 00:10:40,679
- He's more than an athlete.
- Dumb Krum.

110
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,247
He's an artist.

111
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,680
- I think you're in love, Ron.
- Shut up.

112
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,251
Viktor, I love you

113
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,012
Viktor, I do

114
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,420
When we're apart
My heart beats only for you

115
00:10:51,592 --> 00:10:54,254
Sounds like the Irish
have got their pride on.

116
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:56,157
Stop! Stop it!

117
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,289
It's not the Irish.

118
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:01,594
We've gotta get out of here. Now!

119
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,070
Get out, it's the Death Eaters!

120
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,607
Get back to the Portkey, everybody,
and stick together!

121
00:11:09,777 --> 00:11:12,439
Fred, George!
Ginny is your responsibility.

122
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,743
Go!

123
00:11:14,915 --> 00:11:16,746
Harry!

124
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,726
- Keep up, you lot!
- Harry!

125
00:11:35,002 --> 00:11:37,129
Harry! Harry!

126
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,275
Morsmordre!

127
00:12:53,047 --> 00:12:54,537
Harry!

128
00:12:56,016 --> 00:12:59,247
- Where are you?
- Harry!

129
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:03,115
We've been looking for you for ages!

130
00:13:04,225 --> 00:13:06,056
Thought we lost you, mate.

131
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,851
What is that?

132
00:13:11,966 --> 00:13:14,025
Stupefy!

133
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:15,532
Stop!

134
00:13:15,703 --> 00:13:17,933
That's my son!

135
00:13:18,973 --> 00:13:21,635
- Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right?
- We came back for Harry.

136
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:23,106
Which of you conjured it?

137
00:13:23,277 --> 00:13:25,438
- Crouch, you can't possi...
- Do not lie!

138
00:13:25,613 --> 00:13:27,604
You've been discovered
at the scene of the crime.

139
00:13:27,781 --> 00:13:29,806
- Crime?
- Barty! They're just kids.

140
00:13:29,984 --> 00:13:31,474
What crime?

141
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:34,143
It's the Dark Mark, Harry. It's his mark.

142
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:35,481
What, Voldemort?

143
00:13:36,657 --> 00:13:40,525
Those people tonight, in the masks,
they're his too, aren't they?

144
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,924
- His followers?
- Yeah.

145
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,995
Death Eaters.

146
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:49,760
- Follow me.
- There was a man, before.

147
00:13:50,237 --> 00:13:51,602
There!

148
00:13:51,772 --> 00:13:54,070
All of you, this way!

149
00:13:54,808 --> 00:13:56,241
A man, Harry?

150
00:13:56,543 --> 00:13:58,010
Who?

151
00:13:58,445 --> 00:14:00,208
I don't know.

152
00:14:01,849 --> 00:14:04,044
I didn't see his face.

153
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:22,292
Anything from the trolley?

154
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,533
Anything from the trolley?

155
00:14:31,478 --> 00:14:33,207
Anything from the trolley, dears?

156
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,575
Packet of Drooble's...

157
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,546
...and a Licorice Wand.

158
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:41,078
On second thought, just the Drooble's.

159
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:45,248
- It's all right, I'll get it. Don't worry.
- Just the Drooble's. Thanks.

160
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,927
Two Pumpkin Pasties, please.

161
00:14:54,301 --> 00:14:55,928
Thank you.

162
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,765
Anything sweet for you, dear?

163
00:14:59,606 --> 00:15:01,938
Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Thank you.

164
00:15:02,843 --> 00:15:04,868
Anything from the trolley?

165
00:15:05,045 --> 00:15:07,070
This is horrible.

166
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,178
How can the Ministry
not know who conjured it?

167
00:15:10,384 --> 00:15:12,113
Wasn't there any security or...?

168
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,084
Loads, according to Dad.

169
00:15:15,255 --> 00:15:19,214
That's what worried them so much.
Happened right under their noses.

170
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:25,265
It's hurting again, isn't it? Your scar.

171
00:15:25,432 --> 00:15:27,093
I'm fine.

172
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,037
You know Sirius will
want to hear about this...

173
00:15:32,206 --> 00:15:36,165
...what you saw at the World Cup
and the dream.

174
00:15:44,618 --> 00:15:47,815
Hedwig. There we go.

175
00:16:26,994 --> 00:16:29,292
Clear the runway!

176
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:37,465
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

177
00:17:01,462 --> 00:17:06,365
Well, now we're all settled in and sorted,
I'd like to make an announcement.

178
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:10,768
This castle will not only be
your home this year...

179
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:14,101
...but home to some
very special guests as well.

180
00:17:14,475 --> 00:17:17,103
You see, Hogwarts has been chosen...

181
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:19,535
Yes, what is it?

182
00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:21,111
What is it?

183
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:26,783
Tell them to wait.
Tell them to wait. Wait.

184
00:17:26,987 --> 00:17:32,926
So Hogwarts has been chosen
to host a legendary event:

185
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,152
The Triwizard Tournament.

186
00:17:35,696 --> 00:17:37,755
- For those of you who do not know...
- Brilliant.

187
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:41,094
...the Triwizard Tournament
brings together three schools...

188
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,395
...for a series of magical contests.

189
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:47,097
From each school, a single student
is selected to compete.

190
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,969
Now let me be clear.

191
00:17:49,142 --> 00:17:52,077
If chosen, you stand alone.

192
00:17:52,246 --> 00:17:54,180
And trust me when I say...

193
00:17:54,348 --> 00:17:57,317
...these contests are not
for the faint-hearted.

194
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:01,952
But more of that later.
For now, please join me in welcoming...

195
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:06,149
...the lovely ladies of the
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic...

196
00:18:06,326 --> 00:18:10,319
...and their headmistress,
Madame Maxime.

197
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:24,434
Bloody hell.

198
00:18:32,286 --> 00:18:34,618
Blimey. That's one big woman.

199
00:18:56,643 --> 00:18:58,702
And now our friends from the north.

200
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:01,712
Please greet the proud sons
of Durmstrang...

201
00:19:01,882 --> 00:19:04,715
...and their high master,
lgor Karkaroff.

202
00:19:27,774 --> 00:19:29,332
Oh, it's Krum!

203
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:30,976
Blimey, it's him!

204
00:19:31,144 --> 00:19:33,009
Viktor Krum!

205
00:19:41,922 --> 00:19:43,355
Albus.

206
00:19:43,523 --> 00:19:45,252
Igor.

207
00:19:58,872 --> 00:20:02,535
Professor Dumbly-dorr,
my horses have traveled a long way.

208
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:05,234
- They will need attending to.
- Don't worry, Madame Maxime.

209
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:08,939
Our gamekeeper, Hagrid,
is more than capable of seeing to them.

210
00:20:09,116 --> 00:20:11,380
But you know, Monsieur Hagrid...

211
00:20:11,885 --> 00:20:14,251
...they drink only single-malt whiskey.

212
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,156
You idiot!

213
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:29,158
Your attention, please!

214
00:20:31,505 --> 00:20:33,666
I'd like to say a few words.

215
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:37,468
Eternal glory.

216
00:20:37,911 --> 00:20:41,938
That is what awaits the student
who wins the Triwizard Tournament.

217
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:46,313
But to do this, that student
must survive three tasks.

218
00:20:46,486 --> 00:20:50,445
Three extremely dangerous tasks.

219
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:51,880
- Wicked.
- Wicked.

220
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:56,291
For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit
to impose a new rule.

221
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,828
To explain all this...

222
00:20:57,998 --> 00:21:01,627
...we have the head of the Department
of International Magical Cooperation...

223
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,963
...Mr. Bartemius Crouch.

224
00:21:18,385 --> 00:21:21,115
Bloody hell. It's Mad-Eye Moody.

225
00:21:21,888 --> 00:21:25,085
- Alastor Moody? The Auror?
- Auror?

226
00:21:25,258 --> 00:21:28,716
Dark-wizard catcher. Half the cells
in Azkaban are filled thanks to him.

227
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:32,523
He's supposed to be mad as a hatter,
though, these days.

228
00:21:44,311 --> 00:21:48,077
- My dear old friend, thanks for coming.
- Stupid ceiling.

229
00:21:48,248 --> 00:21:49,340
Thank you.

230
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,721
What's that he's drinking,
do you suppose?

231
00:21:58,158 --> 00:22:01,150
I don't know, but I don't think
it's pumpkin juice.

232
00:22:08,135 --> 00:22:10,069
After due consideration...

233
00:22:10,237 --> 00:22:13,138
...the Ministry has concluded that,
for their own safety...

234
00:22:13,306 --> 00:22:16,275
...no student under the age of 17...

235
00:22:16,443 --> 00:22:20,174
...shall be allowed to put forth their
name for the Triwizard Tournament.

236
00:22:20,347 --> 00:22:23,043
- This decision is final.
- That's rubbish!

237
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,810
That's rubbish!
You don't know what you're doing!

238
00:22:25,986 --> 00:22:29,717
- Silence!
- They're not too happy about that, then.

239
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:51,543
The Goblet of Fire.

240
00:22:52,112 --> 00:22:55,013
Anyone wishing to submit themselves
to the tournament...

241
00:22:55,182 --> 00:22:58,083
...need only write their name
upon a piece of parchment...

242
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:01,345
...and throw it in the flame before
this hour on Thursday night.

243
00:23:02,455 --> 00:23:04,685
Do not do so lightly.

244
00:23:05,058 --> 00:23:08,619
If chosen, there's no turning back.

245
00:23:08,795 --> 00:23:13,755
As from this moment,
the Triwizard Tournament has begun.

246
00:23:39,926 --> 00:23:41,985
Alastor Moody.

247
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,557
Ex-Auror...

248
00:23:47,267 --> 00:23:49,701
...Ministry malcontent...

249
00:23:49,903 --> 00:23:52,303
...and your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

250
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:56,932
I am here because Dumbledore asked me.
End of story, goodbye, the end.

251
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,873
Any questions?

252
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,777
When it comes to the Dark Arts...

253
00:24:05,151 --> 00:24:07,813
...I believe in a practical approach.

254
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:13,688
But first, which of you can tell me
how many Unforgivable Curses there are?

255
00:24:14,227 --> 00:24:16,559
- Three, sir.
- And they are so named?

256
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,961
Because they are unforgivable.
The use of any one of them will...

257
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:24,263
Will earn you a one-way ticket
to Azkaban, correct.

258
00:24:24,437 --> 00:24:27,167
The Ministry says you're too young
to see what these curses do.

259
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,798
I say different! You need to know
what you're up against!

260
00:24:30,977 --> 00:24:33,138
You need to be prepared.

261
00:24:33,313 --> 00:24:35,781
You need to find another place
to put your chewing gum...

262
00:24:35,949 --> 00:24:38,247
...besides the underside of your desk,
Mr. Finnigan!

263
00:24:38,418 --> 00:24:41,410
No way. The old codger
can see out the back of his head.

264
00:24:42,122 --> 00:24:43,885
And hear across classrooms!

265
00:24:46,226 --> 00:24:49,718
So which curse shall we see first?

266
00:24:49,896 --> 00:24:51,124
- Weasley!
- Yes?

267
00:24:51,298 --> 00:24:52,629
Stand.

268
00:24:55,802 --> 00:24:57,565
Give us a curse.

269
00:24:57,737 --> 00:25:01,605
Well, my dad did tell me about one.

270
00:25:02,175 --> 00:25:03,437
The lmperius Curse.

271
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:06,909
Oh, yeah, your father
would know all about that.

272
00:25:07,314 --> 00:25:09,976
Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief
a few years ago.

273
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,941
Perhaps this will show you why.

274
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,891
Hello.

275
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,225
Lovely little beauty.

276
00:25:28,368 --> 00:25:30,359
Engorgio.

277
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,398
Imperio!

278
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,244
Don't worry. It's completely harmless.

279
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,079
If she bites...

280
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,110
...she's lethal.

281
00:25:51,658 --> 00:25:53,455
What are you laughing at?

282
00:25:54,794 --> 00:25:56,227
Get off!

283
00:25:58,665 --> 00:26:00,428
Talented, isn't she?

284
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,001
What should I have her do next?
Jump out the window?

285
00:26:05,972 --> 00:26:07,371
Drown herself?

286
00:26:19,152 --> 00:26:22,417
Scores of witches and wizards
have claimed...

287
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:26,582
...that they only did
You-Know-Who's bidding...

288
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,990
...under the influence
of the lmperius Curse.

289
00:26:29,162 --> 00:26:31,096
But here's the rub:

290
00:26:31,431 --> 00:26:34,423
How do we sort out the liars?

291
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,465
Another, another.

292
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,996
Up, up. Come on.

293
00:26:41,174 --> 00:26:42,732
Longbottom, is it?

294
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,900
Up.

295
00:26:46,946 --> 00:26:50,814
Professor Sprout tells me
you have an aptitude for herbology.

296
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:54,346
There's the...

297
00:26:54,587 --> 00:26:56,521
The Cruciatus Curse.

298
00:26:56,689 --> 00:26:59,556
Correct, correct. Come, come.

299
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:01,386
Particularly nasty.

300
00:27:04,431 --> 00:27:06,262
The torture curse.

301
00:27:07,267 --> 00:27:09,428
Crucio!

302
00:27:22,148 --> 00:27:25,948
Stop it! Can't you see
it's bothering him? Stop it!

303
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:47,563
Perhaps you could give us the last
Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.

304
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:51,340
No?

305
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,672
Avada Kedavra!

306
00:27:58,451 --> 00:27:59,975
The Killing Curse.

307
00:28:01,121 --> 00:28:04,249
Only one person is known
to have survived it...

308
00:28:04,824 --> 00:28:07,190
...and he's sitting in this room.

309
00:28:38,791 --> 00:28:40,554
Brilliant, isn't he?

310
00:28:40,727 --> 00:28:44,754
Completely demented, of course, and
terrifying to be in the same room with...

311
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:48,094
...but he's really been there, you know?
He's looked evil in the eye.

312
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,862
There's a reason those curses
are unforgivable.

313
00:28:51,037 --> 00:28:55,133
To perform them in a classroom...
I mean, did you see Neville's face?

314
00:28:58,077 --> 00:28:59,544
Neville?

315
00:28:59,712 --> 00:29:01,145
Son?

316
00:29:01,514 --> 00:29:03,141
You all right?

317
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:07,484
Come on. We'll have a cup of tea.
I want to show you something.

318
00:29:22,035 --> 00:29:24,026
We're gonna be late!

319
00:29:37,617 --> 00:29:39,949
Come on, Cedric. Put it in!

320
00:29:55,568 --> 00:29:58,059
Eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it?

321
00:29:58,238 --> 00:30:00,866
Three years from now,
when we're old enough to be chosen.

322
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,667
Yeah, rather you than me.

323
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,776
Yes!

324
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,880
Thank you, thank you.

325
00:30:09,048 --> 00:30:12,108
- Well, lads, we've done it.
- Cooked it up just this morning.

326
00:30:12,285 --> 00:30:14,446
It's not going to work.

327
00:30:15,655 --> 00:30:18,146
- Oh, yeah?
- And why is that, Granger?

328
00:30:18,324 --> 00:30:21,293
You see this? This is an Age Line.

329
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:23,258
Dumbledore drew it himself.

330
00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:24,862
So?

331
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:30,061
So a genius like Dumbledore
couldn't possibly be fooled...

332
00:30:30,236 --> 00:30:33,228
...by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted
as an Aging Potion.

333
00:30:33,406 --> 00:30:37,672
- But that's why it's so brilliant.
- Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.

334
00:30:39,412 --> 00:30:41,403
- Ready, Fred?
- Ready, George.

335
00:30:41,581 --> 00:30:43,412
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

336
00:30:46,853 --> 00:30:48,753
- Yes!
- Yes!

337
00:30:49,622 --> 00:30:51,089
Yeah!

338
00:30:52,258 --> 00:30:53,885
Yes!

339
00:30:54,327 --> 00:30:55,817
Ready?

340
00:30:59,132 --> 00:31:01,259
- Yes!
- Yes!

341
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:11,777
- You said!
- You said!

342
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:16,181
- Oh, right, you want a piece of me?!
- I'll tear your ears off!

343
00:31:16,349 --> 00:31:18,840
- Now you're making me laugh.
- Take this! Come on!

344
00:31:19,018 --> 00:31:20,451
Fight! Fight! Fight!

345
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:27,287
We're "old school," right?

346
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,860
Yeah, but you look older!

347
00:32:01,227 --> 00:32:03,889
Sit down. Please.

348
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,167
Now the moment
you've all been waiting for:

349
00:32:10,336 --> 00:32:12,463
The champion selection.

350
00:32:43,903 --> 00:32:47,703
The Durmstrang champion
is Viktor Krum.

351
00:33:03,656 --> 00:33:06,056
The champion for Beauxbatons...

352
00:33:06,225 --> 00:33:08,250
...is Fleur Delacour.

353
00:33:18,805 --> 00:33:21,797
The Hogwarts champion, Cedric Diggory!

354
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:36,254
Excellent! We now have
our three champions.

355
00:33:36,422 --> 00:33:40,620
But in the end,
only one will go down in history.

356
00:33:40,793 --> 00:33:44,126
Only one will hoist
this chalice of champions...

357
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:47,456
...this vessel of victory...

358
00:33:47,633 --> 00:33:49,828
...the Triwizard Cup!

359
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,261
Harry Potter.

360
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,997
Harry Potter?

361
00:34:30,376 --> 00:34:32,571
No. No.

362
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:34,376
Harry Potter!

363
00:34:34,814 --> 00:34:36,304
Go on, Harry.

364
00:34:36,482 --> 00:34:38,245
Harry, for goodness sake.

365
00:35:09,749 --> 00:35:10,943
He's a cheat!

366
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:14,044
He's not even 17 yet!

367
00:35:41,914 --> 00:35:45,406
- It's wrong, I tell you!
- You French tart.

368
00:35:45,585 --> 00:35:48,554
- Everything is a conspiracy theory with you!
- Quiet! I can't think!

369
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:50,712
- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- I protest.

370
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,084
- Harry.
- I protest!

371
00:35:52,258 --> 00:35:54,123
Did you put your name
in the Goblet of Fire?

372
00:35:54,293 --> 00:35:56,454
- No, sir.
- Did you ask one of the older students...

373
00:35:56,629 --> 00:35:57,960
...to do it for you?
- No, sir.

374
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:01,031
- You're absolutely sure?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

375
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:03,697
- But of course he is lying.
- The hell he is!

376
00:36:03,903 --> 00:36:06,269
The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally
powerful magical object.

377
00:36:06,439 --> 00:36:09,567
Only an exceptionally powerful
Confundus Charm could have hoodwinked it.

378
00:36:09,742 --> 00:36:11,733
Magic way beyond the talents
of a fourth year.

379
00:36:11,911 --> 00:36:14,903
You seem to have given this
a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.

380
00:36:15,081 --> 00:36:18,244
It was once my job to think
as dark wizards do, Karkaroff...

381
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:21,511
...perhaps you remember.
- This doesn't help, Alastor.

382
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:25,587
Leave this to you, Barty.

383
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:29,154
The rules are absolute.

384
00:36:30,363 --> 00:36:34,094
The Goblet of Fire constitutes
a binding magical contract.

385
00:36:35,635 --> 00:36:37,830
Mr. Potter has no choice.

386
00:36:38,638 --> 00:36:40,970
He is, as of tonight...

387
00:36:42,775 --> 00:36:44,800
...a Triwizard champion.

388
00:37:12,738 --> 00:37:14,865
This can't go on, Albus.

389
00:37:15,207 --> 00:37:18,040
First the Dark Mark. Now this?

390
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,201
What do you suggest, Minerva?

391
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,439
Put an end to it.

392
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:25,907
Don't let Potter compete.

393
00:37:26,085 --> 00:37:28,553
You heard Barty. The rules are clear.

394
00:37:28,721 --> 00:37:31,554
Well, the devil with Barty
and his rules.

395
00:37:31,724 --> 00:37:34,158
And since when did you
accommodate the Ministry?

396
00:37:34,326 --> 00:37:38,319
Headmaster, I, too, find it difficult
to believe this mere coincidence.

397
00:37:38,497 --> 00:37:42,433
However, if we are to truly discover
the meaning of these events...

398
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:46,196
...perhaps we should,
for the time being...

399
00:37:47,106 --> 00:37:49,370
...let them unfold.

400
00:37:49,542 --> 00:37:51,703
What...? Do nothing?

401
00:37:51,877 --> 00:37:53,504
Offer him up as bait?

402
00:37:54,513 --> 00:37:57,346
Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.

403
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,980
I agree. With Severus.

404
00:38:01,554 --> 00:38:04,387
Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?

405
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:07,125
- I can do that.
- Don't let him know, though.

406
00:38:07,393 --> 00:38:10,487
He must be anxious enough as it is...

407
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,692
...knowing what lies ahead.

408
00:38:14,066 --> 00:38:16,626
Then again, we all are.

409
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,314
How did you do it?

410
00:38:34,787 --> 00:38:39,417
Never mind. Doesn't matter.
Might've let your best friend know, though.

411
00:38:39,592 --> 00:38:42,891
- Let you know what?
- You know bloody well what.

412
00:38:43,062 --> 00:38:45,462
I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.

413
00:38:45,931 --> 00:38:47,523
Okay?

414
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,191
- You're being stupid.
- Yeah, that's me.

415
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:53,896
Ron Weasley,
Harry Potter's stupid friend.

416
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,578
I didn't put my name in that cup.

417
00:39:00,012 --> 00:39:03,846
I don't want eternal glory.
I just wanna be...

418
00:39:05,618 --> 00:39:10,078
Look, I don't know what happened tonight,
and I don't know why.

419
00:39:10,256 --> 00:39:11,484
It just did.

420
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:13,916
Okay?

421
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,498
Piss off.

422
00:39:39,518 --> 00:39:41,986
What a charismatic quartet.

423
00:39:43,322 --> 00:39:44,914
Hello.

424
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:48,351
I'm Rita Skeeter.

425
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,419
I write for the Daily Prophet.

426
00:39:52,031 --> 00:39:56,730
But of course you know that, don't you?
It's you we don't know.

427
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,100
You're the juicy news.

428
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:03,469
What quirks lurk
beneath those rosy cheeks?

429
00:40:03,676 --> 00:40:07,134
What mysteries do the muscles mask?

430
00:40:07,313 --> 00:40:10,544
Does courage lie beneath those curls?

431
00:40:10,716 --> 00:40:13,742
In short, what makes a champion tick?

432
00:40:14,253 --> 00:40:18,553
"Me, Myself & l" want to know.
Not to mention my rabid readers.

433
00:40:18,724 --> 00:40:21,215
So who's feeling up to sharing?

434
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:27,124
Shall we start with the youngest?
Lovely.

435
00:40:39,411 --> 00:40:41,208
This is cozy.

436
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,475
It's a broom cupboard.

437
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:46,147
You should feel right at home, then.

438
00:40:46,352 --> 00:40:49,116
Don't mind if I use
a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?

439
00:40:49,288 --> 00:40:50,846
No.

440
00:40:51,223 --> 00:40:53,214
So tell me, Harry.

441
00:40:53,392 --> 00:40:56,293
Here you sit, a mere boy of 12...

442
00:40:56,462 --> 00:40:57,952
I'm 14. Sorry.

443
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:01,099
- About to compete
against three students...

444
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:04,532
...not only vastly more
emotionally mature than yourself...

445
00:41:04,703 --> 00:41:07,297
...but who have mastered spells
that you wouldn't attempt...

446
00:41:07,473 --> 00:41:09,805
...in your dizziest daydreams.

447
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:12,334
Concerned?

448
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:16,345
I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it.

449
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,380
Just ignore the quill.

450
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,376
Then, of course,
you're no ordinary boy of 12, are you?

451
00:41:21,553 --> 00:41:24,147
- Fourteen.
- Your story's legend.

452
00:41:24,924 --> 00:41:27,085
Do you think it was
the trauma of your past...

453
00:41:27,259 --> 00:41:30,490
...that made you so keen to enter
such a dangerous tournament?

454
00:41:30,663 --> 00:41:32,426
No, I didn't enter.

455
00:41:32,598 --> 00:41:34,190
Of course you didn't.

456
00:41:36,468 --> 00:41:38,095
Everyone loves a rebel, Harry.

457
00:41:40,406 --> 00:41:41,930
Scratch that last.

458
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:46,872
Speaking of your parents, were they alive,
how do you think they'd feel?

459
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,843
Proud? Or concerned...

460
00:41:49,014 --> 00:41:52,848
...that your attitude shows, at best,
a pathological need for attention...

461
00:41:53,018 --> 00:41:55,612
...at worst, a psychotic death wish?

462
00:41:56,622 --> 00:42:01,685
Hey, my eyes aren't
"glistening with the ghosts of my past."

463
00:42:33,993 --> 00:42:36,325
Harry, I couldn't risk sending Hedwig.

464
00:42:36,495 --> 00:42:39,760
Since the World Cup, the Ministry's
been intercepting more and more owls...

465
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:42,162
...and she's too easily recognized.

466
00:42:42,334 --> 00:42:45,201
We need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.

467
00:42:45,371 --> 00:42:49,535
Meet me in the Gryffindor common room,
1:00 this Saturday night.

468
00:42:49,708 --> 00:42:51,471
And make sure you're alone.

469
00:42:51,643 --> 00:42:53,133
Sirius.

470
00:42:53,312 --> 00:42:54,802
P. S:

471
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,777
The bird bites.

472
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,559
Sirius?

473
00:43:25,444 --> 00:43:27,344
Harry Potter, age 12...

474
00:43:27,513 --> 00:43:30,482
...suspect entrant
in the Triwizard Tournament.

475
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:33,243
His eyes swimming
with the ghosts of his past...

476
00:43:33,419 --> 00:43:34,977
...and choking back tears...

477
00:43:50,469 --> 00:43:53,063
Sirius. How...?

478
00:43:53,238 --> 00:43:55,729
I don't have much time,
so let me get straight to it.

479
00:43:55,908 --> 00:43:58,843
Did you or did you not put your name
into the Goblet of Fire?

480
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,478
No!

481
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,342
I had to ask.

482
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:07,315
Now, tell me about this dream of yours.
You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.

483
00:44:07,486 --> 00:44:09,920
But who was the third man in the room?

484
00:44:10,089 --> 00:44:12,580
- I don't know.
- You didn't hear a name?

485
00:44:13,425 --> 00:44:14,949
No.

486
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:19,592
Voldemort was giving him a job to do.
Something important.

487
00:44:19,765 --> 00:44:21,062
And what was that?

488
00:44:23,235 --> 00:44:24,862
He wanted...

489
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,698
...me.

490
00:44:27,272 --> 00:44:31,606
I don't know why. But he was
gonna use this man to get to me.

491
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,039
But, I mean, it was only a dream, right?

492
00:44:35,414 --> 00:44:37,041
Yes.

493
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,774
It's just a dream.

494
00:44:39,518 --> 00:44:40,951
Look, Harry.

495
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:44,578
The Death Eaters at the World Cup,
your name rising from that goblet...

496
00:44:44,756 --> 00:44:48,749
...these are not just coincidences.
Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.

497
00:44:48,927 --> 00:44:50,019
What are you saying?

498
00:44:50,195 --> 00:44:54,461
I'm saying the devils are inside
the walls. Igor Karkaroff?

499
00:44:54,633 --> 00:44:59,036
He was a Death Eater. And no one,
no one stops being a Death Eater.

500
00:44:59,471 --> 00:45:04,602
Then there's Barty Crouch. Heart of stone.
Sent his own son to Azkaban.

501
00:45:09,414 --> 00:45:11,507
You think one of them
put my name in the goblet?

502
00:45:11,683 --> 00:45:13,981
I haven't a clue who put your name
in that goblet...

503
00:45:14,153 --> 00:45:18,112
...but whoever did is no friend to you.
People die in this tournament.

504
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:21,782
- I'm not ready for this, Sirius.
- You don't have a choice.

505
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:27,730
- Someone's coming.
- Keep your friends close, Harry.

506
00:45:31,036 --> 00:45:32,367
Who were you talking to?

507
00:45:32,538 --> 00:45:35,598
- What? Who says I was talking to anyone?
- I heard voices.

508
00:45:35,874 --> 00:45:39,867
Maybe you're imagining things.
Wouldn't be the first time.

509
00:45:40,412 --> 00:45:43,745
You're probably just practicing
for your next interview, I expect.

510
00:46:09,675 --> 00:46:11,302
Amazing.

511
00:46:13,278 --> 00:46:16,975
- Amazing!
- Neville. You're doing it again.

512
00:46:17,549 --> 00:46:18,948
Right, sorry.

513
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:22,810
"Magical Water Plants
of the Highland Lochs"?

514
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:26,151
Moody gave it to me.
That day we had tea.

515
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,388
It's already been through enough people.

516
00:46:29,561 --> 00:46:31,654
Why don't you just go
and talk to him yourself?

517
00:46:33,131 --> 00:46:35,463
Ron, this is your problem, not mine.

518
00:46:35,634 --> 00:46:37,727
What do you want me to say again?

519
00:46:37,903 --> 00:46:39,234
Go.

520
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:46,338
Ronald would like me to tell you
that Seamus told him...

521
00:46:46,912 --> 00:46:50,507
...that Dean was told by Parvati
that Hagrid's looking for you.

522
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:53,116
Is that right? Well, you...

523
00:46:53,285 --> 00:46:54,343
What?

524
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:02,393
- Are you sure you won't do this?
- Do it.

525
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:08,166
Dean was told by Parvati that...

526
00:47:09,401 --> 00:47:11,631
Please don't ask me to say it again.

527
00:47:12,004 --> 00:47:13,471
Hagrid's looking for you.

528
00:47:13,972 --> 00:47:17,032
- Well, you can tell Ronald...
- I'm not an owl!

529
00:47:27,586 --> 00:47:29,850
Did you bring your father's cloak,
like I asked you?

530
00:47:30,022 --> 00:47:32,616
Yeah, I brought the cloak.
Hagrid, where are we going?

531
00:47:32,791 --> 00:47:34,190
You'll see soon enough.

532
00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:36,554
Now pay attention, this is important.

533
00:47:38,297 --> 00:47:39,764
What's with the flower?

534
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:43,199
Hagrid, have you combed your hair?

535
00:47:43,602 --> 00:47:45,331
As a matter of fact, I have.

536
00:47:45,771 --> 00:47:48,706
You might like to try the same thing
now and again.

537
00:47:57,215 --> 00:47:58,682
Hagrid?

538
00:48:02,587 --> 00:48:04,487
The cloak! Put the cloak on!

539
00:48:11,029 --> 00:48:14,430
- Bonsoir, Olympe.
- Oh, Hagrid.

540
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:18,330
I thought perhaps you weren't coming.
I thought perhaps...

541
00:48:18,503 --> 00:48:21,165
...you had forgotten me.

542
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,308
Couldn't forget you, Olympe.

543
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:25,773
What is it you wanted to show me?

544
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:30,677
When we spoke earlier,
you sounded so...

545
00:48:31,016 --> 00:48:32,506
...exhilarated.

546
00:48:33,085 --> 00:48:35,918
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.

547
00:48:46,498 --> 00:48:48,261
Can we get closer?

548
00:48:56,074 --> 00:48:57,541
Dragons?

549
00:48:57,709 --> 00:48:59,199
That's the first task?

550
00:48:59,611 --> 00:49:01,636
- You're joking.
- Come on, Harry.

551
00:49:02,914 --> 00:49:05,940
These are seriously
misunderstood creatures.

552
00:49:07,052 --> 00:49:08,519
Oh, crikey!

553
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:14,014
Although, I have to admit,
that Horntail is a right nasty piece of work.

554
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:17,159
Poor Ron nearly fainted
just seeing him, you know.

555
00:49:18,663 --> 00:49:20,688
- Ron was here?
- Oh, sure.

556
00:49:20,866 --> 00:49:24,393
His brother Charlie helped
to bring him over from Romania.

557
00:49:24,569 --> 00:49:26,002
Didn't Ron tell you that?

558
00:49:27,939 --> 00:49:29,338
No, he didn't.

559
00:49:30,075 --> 00:49:31,940
He didn't tell me a thing.

560
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:44,981
- You cheat, Potter.
- You stink, Potter.

561
00:49:46,491 --> 00:49:49,153
- Good luck, Potter.
- Potter stinks!

562
00:49:49,327 --> 00:49:51,989
- Cedric rules.
- Thanks.

563
00:49:53,064 --> 00:49:54,725
Like the badge?

564
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,029
Excuse me.

565
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,673
Harry.

566
00:50:03,241 --> 00:50:05,209
Hey! Read the badge, Potter!

567
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,867
Can I have a word?

568
00:50:07,846 --> 00:50:09,711
- All right.
- You stink, Potter!

569
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:12,873
- Potter, you stink!
- Harry Potter smells!

570
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,947
Dragons. That's the first task.

571
00:50:18,123 --> 00:50:21,251
- They've got one for each of us.
- Come on, Ced!

572
00:50:21,426 --> 00:50:23,451
Are you serious?

573
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:27,255
And Fleur and Krum, do they...?

574
00:50:27,432 --> 00:50:29,696
- Yes.
- Come on, Ced, leave him.

575
00:50:29,868 --> 00:50:31,335
- Right.
- He's not worth it.

576
00:50:31,503 --> 00:50:33,994
- Read the badges, Potter!
- Hey, listen. About the badges.

577
00:50:34,172 --> 00:50:37,198
- I've asked them not to wear them, but...
- Don't worry about it.

578
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:39,809
It's not like I try
to blow things up, exactly.

579
00:50:40,512 --> 00:50:41,979
It just happens a fair bit.

580
00:50:42,147 --> 00:50:45,207
You have to admit, though,
fire's pretty fascinating.

581
00:50:45,383 --> 00:50:47,214
You're a right foul git, you know that?

582
00:50:47,385 --> 00:50:49,649
- You think so?
- I know so.

583
00:50:49,821 --> 00:50:51,152
Anything else?

584
00:50:51,323 --> 00:50:54,815
- Yeah. Stay away from me.
- Fine.

585
00:50:57,195 --> 00:51:00,790
- There's Potter. Cheat.
- Why so tense, Potter?

586
00:51:01,566 --> 00:51:03,966
My father and I have a bet, you see.

587
00:51:04,135 --> 00:51:07,332
I don't think you're gonna last
10 minutes in this tournament.

588
00:51:09,908 --> 00:51:12,843
He disagrees.
He thinks you won't last five.

589
00:51:13,011 --> 00:51:16,139
I don't give a damn
what your father thinks, Malfoy.

590
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:21,108
He's vile and cruel.
And you're just pathetic.

591
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,614
- Pathetic?
- Oh, no, you don't, sonny!

592
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:29,692
I'll teach you to curse someone
when their back is turned!

593
00:51:29,861 --> 00:51:33,695
You stinking, cowardly, scummy...

594
00:51:33,865 --> 00:51:35,594
- Professor Moody!
...back-shooting...

595
00:51:35,767 --> 00:51:38,668
- What are you doing?
- Teaching.

596
00:51:39,704 --> 00:51:43,834
- Is that a...? Is that a student?
- Technically, it's a ferret.

597
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,415
Stand still! Stand still!

598
00:52:02,394 --> 00:52:04,589
- My father will hear about this!
- Is that a threat?

599
00:52:04,763 --> 00:52:06,697
- Professor Moody!
- Is that a threat?

600
00:52:06,865 --> 00:52:08,730
Professor!

601
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,461
I could tell you stories about your father
that would curl even your greasy hair!

602
00:52:12,637 --> 00:52:15,333
- Alastor! Alastor.
- It doesn't end here!

603
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:19,307
We never use transfiguration
as a punishment!

604
00:52:19,477 --> 00:52:21,672
Surely Dumbledore told you that.

605
00:52:22,213 --> 00:52:26,673
- He might've mentioned it.
- Well, you will do well to remember it.

606
00:52:27,786 --> 00:52:29,253
Away!

607
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:34,552
You. Come with me.

608
00:53:09,794 --> 00:53:11,853
That's a Foe-Glass.

609
00:53:12,597 --> 00:53:14,758
Lets me keep an eye on my enemies.

610
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:19,569
If I can see the whites of their eyes,
they're standing right behind me.

611
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:26,210
Wouldn't even bother telling you
what's in there.

612
00:53:26,378 --> 00:53:28,403
You wouldn't believe it if I did.

613
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,375
Now...

614
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:34,883
...what are you going to do
about your dragon?

615
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:41,088
Well, you know, I just thought I'd...

616
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,050
Sit.

617
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:49,165
Listen to me, Potter.

618
00:53:50,168 --> 00:53:51,328
Your pal Diggory?

619
00:53:51,503 --> 00:53:55,963
By your age, he could turn a whistle
into a watch and have it sing you the time.

620
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:58,370
Miss Delacour?

621
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:01,507
She's as much a fairy princess as I am.

622
00:54:02,013 --> 00:54:05,574
As for Krum, his head
may be filled with sawdust...

623
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,911
...but Karkaroff's is not.

624
00:54:08,086 --> 00:54:09,917
They'll have a strategy.

625
00:54:10,088 --> 00:54:13,615
And you can bet that it will
play to Krum's strengths.

626
00:54:18,396 --> 00:54:19,954
Come on, Potter.

627
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:22,224
What are your strengths?

628
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,167
I don't know.

629
00:54:25,336 --> 00:54:28,134
Well, I can fly.
I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But I...

630
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:32,333
- Better than fair, the way I heard it.
- But I'm not allowed a broom.

631
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:36,139
You're allowed a wand.

632
00:54:42,587 --> 00:54:44,054
Bets! Place your bets!

633
00:54:44,222 --> 00:54:46,383
Bets taken! Bets taken here!

634
00:54:46,558 --> 00:54:49,493
Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter
in today's bloodbath?

635
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:52,528
Smart money's on Krum to survive!
Any bets?

636
00:54:52,697 --> 00:54:54,187
Yes, sir?

637
00:54:54,532 --> 00:54:57,262
Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go.
Thank you very much.

638
00:54:57,769 --> 00:54:59,703
Your attention, please.

639
00:54:59,938 --> 00:55:02,532
This is a great day for all of us.

640
00:55:05,977 --> 00:55:10,209
Each of the three tasks involves
very considerable danger.

641
00:55:10,381 --> 00:55:13,077
Please keep your seats at all times.

642
00:55:13,251 --> 00:55:15,981
This will minimize any risks
you may be exposed to.

643
00:55:16,154 --> 00:55:19,590
- Harry? Is that you?
- Yeah.

644
00:55:19,758 --> 00:55:21,453
I'm sure we all wish our champions...

645
00:55:21,626 --> 00:55:24,686
- How are you feeling? Okay?
...the greatest of luck.

646
00:55:26,998 --> 00:55:30,399
The key is to concentrate.
After that, you just have to...

647
00:55:30,568 --> 00:55:32,399
Battle a dragon.

648
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:39,199
Young love.

649
00:55:39,911 --> 00:55:41,173
How...

650
00:55:43,648 --> 00:55:44,945
...stirring.

651
00:55:47,619 --> 00:55:50,782
If everything goes unfortunately today...

652
00:55:50,955 --> 00:55:53,719
...you two may even
make the front page.

653
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,122
You have no business here.

654
00:55:56,294 --> 00:55:58,319
This tent is for champions...

655
00:55:58,663 --> 00:56:00,358
...and friends.

656
00:56:03,168 --> 00:56:07,332
No matter. We've got what we wanted.

657
00:56:10,475 --> 00:56:13,273
Good day, champions.
Gather round, please.

658
00:56:13,444 --> 00:56:17,642
Now, you've waited, you've wondered,
and at last the moment has arrived.

659
00:56:17,816 --> 00:56:21,047
A moment only four of you
can fully appreciate.

660
00:56:21,219 --> 00:56:23,346
What are you doing here, Miss Granger?

661
00:56:24,656 --> 00:56:26,317
Sorry, I'll just go.

662
00:56:26,491 --> 00:56:28,083
Barty, the bag.

663
00:56:28,459 --> 00:56:30,689
Champions, in a circle around me.

664
00:56:30,862 --> 00:56:33,956
Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.

665
00:56:34,132 --> 00:56:38,068
And, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here.
That's right. Now...

666
00:56:38,236 --> 00:56:40,670
...Miss Delacour, if you will.

667
00:56:44,742 --> 00:56:46,403
The Welsh Green.

668
00:56:51,049 --> 00:56:52,380
Mr. Krum.

669
00:56:55,353 --> 00:56:57,253
The Chinese Fireball.

670
00:57:03,728 --> 00:57:06,128
The Swedish Short-Snout.

671
00:57:06,598 --> 00:57:08,589
- Which leaves...
- The Horntail.

672
00:57:08,766 --> 00:57:11,030
- What's that, boy?
- Nothing.

673
00:57:14,439 --> 00:57:16,839
The Hungarian Horntail.

674
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:22,138
These represent four
very real dragons...

675
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:25,373
...each of which has been given
a golden egg to protect.

676
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:28,018
Your objective is simple:

677
00:57:28,186 --> 00:57:29,676
Collect the egg.

678
00:57:29,854 --> 00:57:32,846
This you must do,
for each egg contains a clue...

679
00:57:33,024 --> 00:57:36,516
...without which you cannot hope
to proceed to the next task.

680
00:57:36,694 --> 00:57:38,025
Any questions?

681
00:57:39,063 --> 00:57:41,725
Very well. Good luck, champions.

682
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:44,733
Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon,
you may...

683
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:57,178
Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!

684
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,127
Three of our champions
have now faced their dragons...

685
00:58:12,297 --> 00:58:15,789
...and so each one of them
will proceed to the next task.

686
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:19,461
And now our fourth and final contestant.

687
00:58:21,439 --> 00:58:25,000
Harry! Harry! Harry!

688
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:35,045
Your wand, Harry! Your wand!

689
00:59:35,546 --> 00:59:37,571
Accio Firebolt!

690
01:00:06,577 --> 01:00:08,738
- Yeah!
- Yes!

691
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:19,088
Oh, my God.

692
01:00:28,733 --> 01:00:32,032
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Well done, dragon!

693
01:03:04,021 --> 01:03:06,182
Yes! Yes!

694
01:03:29,413 --> 01:03:32,109
- Yes, Harry!
- Knew you wouldn't die, Harry. Lose a leg.

695
01:03:32,283 --> 01:03:34,217
- Or an arm.
- Pack it in altogether?

696
01:03:34,385 --> 01:03:36,148
- Never!
- Never!

697
01:03:38,256 --> 01:03:39,587
Shush!

698
01:03:40,057 --> 01:03:42,719
Go on, Harry. What's the clue?

699
01:03:43,761 --> 01:03:46,594
- Who wants me to open it?
- Yes!

700
01:03:47,398 --> 01:03:49,923
- Do you want me to open it?
- Yes!

701
01:04:01,112 --> 01:04:03,512
What the bloody hell was that?

702
01:04:07,652 --> 01:04:10,382
All right, everyone!
Go back to your knitting.

703
01:04:10,554 --> 01:04:14,581
This is gonna be uncomfortable enough
without all you nosy sods listening in.

704
01:04:17,762 --> 01:04:21,755
I reckon you have to be barking mad
to put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.

705
01:04:22,099 --> 01:04:24,829
Caught on, have you?
Took you long enough.

706
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:28,063
I wasn't the only one
who thought you'd done it.

707
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:30,503
Everyone was saying it behind your back.

708
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:35,941
Brilliant. That makes me
feel loads better.

709
01:04:36,881 --> 01:04:40,282
- Least I warned you about the dragons.
- Hagrid warned me about the dragons.

710
01:04:40,451 --> 01:04:41,918
No, no, no, I did.

711
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:45,112
No, don't you remember?
I told Hermione to tell you...

712
01:04:45,289 --> 01:04:49,350
...that Seamus told me that Parvati
told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.

713
01:04:49,527 --> 01:04:53,463
Seamus never actually told me anything,
so it was really me all along.

714
01:04:54,465 --> 01:04:57,457
I thought we'd be all right, you know...

715
01:04:57,702 --> 01:04:59,693
...after you'd figured that out.

716
01:05:00,071 --> 01:05:02,733
Who...? Who could possibly
figure that out?

717
01:05:03,407 --> 01:05:04,840
That's completely mental.

718
01:05:05,009 --> 01:05:08,035
Yeah. Isn't it?

719
01:05:08,212 --> 01:05:10,237
I suppose I was a bit distraught.

720
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:14,545
Boys.

721
01:05:39,009 --> 01:05:40,442
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

722
01:05:44,081 --> 01:05:46,675
Cho, Harry's looking at you.

723
01:05:50,621 --> 01:05:52,316
Shush.

724
01:05:53,023 --> 01:05:54,388
Look at this!

725
01:05:56,394 --> 01:05:58,885
I can't believe it! She's done it again.

726
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:02,160
"Miss Granger,
a plain but ambitious girl...

727
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:05,097
...seems to be developing a taste
for famous wizards.

728
01:06:05,269 --> 01:06:07,533
Her latest prey, sources report...

729
01:06:07,705 --> 01:06:11,334
...is none other than the
Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum.

730
01:06:11,642 --> 01:06:15,578
No word yet on how Harry Potter's
taking this latest emotional blow."

731
01:06:16,947 --> 01:06:18,881
Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.

732
01:06:19,049 --> 01:06:20,539
Thank you, Nigel.

733
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:28,189
Not now, Nigel. Later.

734
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:31,551
Go on.

735
01:06:36,901 --> 01:06:39,665
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.

736
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:43,635
Oh, look, Mum's sent me something.

737
01:06:51,782 --> 01:06:53,613
Mum sent me a dress.

738
01:06:53,784 --> 01:06:57,584
Well, it does match your eyes.
Is there a bonnet?

739
01:06:58,055 --> 01:06:59,886
Nose down, Harry.

740
01:07:00,424 --> 01:07:04,383
- Ginny, these must be for you.
- I'm not wearing that, it's ghastly.

741
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:07,961
What are you on about?

742
01:07:08,132 --> 01:07:10,066
They're not for Ginny.

743
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:11,633
They're for you.

744
01:07:12,603 --> 01:07:16,369
- Dress robes.
- Dress robes? For what?

745
01:07:17,608 --> 01:07:19,769
The Yule Ball...

746
01:07:19,944 --> 01:07:25,280
...has been a tradition
of the Triwizard Tournament...

747
01:07:26,016 --> 01:07:28,075
...since its inception.

748
01:07:28,752 --> 01:07:32,620
On Christmas Eve night,
we and our guests...

749
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:34,451
...gather in the Great Hall...

750
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:38,686
...for a night of well-mannered frivolity.

751
01:07:40,231 --> 01:07:42,495
As representatives of the host school...

752
01:07:42,666 --> 01:07:47,763
...I expect each and every one of you
to put your best foot forward.

753
01:07:48,072 --> 01:07:50,700
And I mean this literally, because...

754
01:07:50,875 --> 01:07:55,312
...the Yule Ball is, first and foremost...

755
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:57,670
...a dance.

756
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,716
Silence!

757
01:08:03,921 --> 01:08:06,913
The house of Godric Gryffindor
has commanded the respect...

758
01:08:07,091 --> 01:08:09,719
...of the wizard world
for nearly 10 centuries.

759
01:08:09,894 --> 01:08:13,955
I will not have you, in the course of
a single evening, besmirching that name...

760
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:18,329
...by behaving like a babbling,
bumbling band of baboons.

761
01:08:19,069 --> 01:08:21,037
Try saying that five times fast, huh?

762
01:08:21,205 --> 01:08:22,695
Now, to dance...

763
01:08:22,873 --> 01:08:26,570
...is to let the body breathe.

764
01:08:26,744 --> 01:08:30,077
Inside every girl,
a secret swan slumbers...

765
01:08:30,247 --> 01:08:32,613
...longing to burst forth and take flight.

766
01:08:32,783 --> 01:08:36,776
Something's about to burst out of Eloise
Midgen, but I don't think it's a swan.

767
01:08:36,954 --> 01:08:40,082
Inside every boy,
a lordly lion prepared to prance.

768
01:08:40,257 --> 01:08:42,487
- Mr. Weasley.
- Yes?

769
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:45,094
Will you join me, please?

770
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:53,227
Now, place your right hand on my waist.

771
01:08:53,404 --> 01:08:55,964
- Where?
- My waist.

772
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:58,700
And extend your arm.

773
01:08:59,143 --> 01:09:01,111
Mr. Filch, if you please.

774
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:06,172
One, two, three.

775
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:09,842
One, two, three. One, two, three.

776
01:09:13,557 --> 01:09:15,684
Never gonna let him forget this, are you?

777
01:09:15,859 --> 01:09:17,019
- Never.
- Never.

778
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:21,062
Everybody come together.
Boys, on your feet!

779
01:09:44,154 --> 01:09:46,088
Why do they have to travel in packs?

780
01:09:46,256 --> 01:09:48,918
How are you supposed to get one
on their own to ask them?

781
01:09:56,767 --> 01:10:00,259
Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons.
If you can't get a date, who can?

782
01:10:00,437 --> 01:10:02,701
I think I'd take the dragon right now.

783
01:10:08,912 --> 01:10:10,470
I take after my mum.

784
01:10:10,648 --> 01:10:14,584
Though I didn't know her very well.
She left when I was about 3.

785
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:16,686
No, not the maternal sort, her.

786
01:10:16,854 --> 01:10:20,415
Broke me dad's heart, though.
He was a tiny little fella, my dad.

787
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:25,119
I could pick him up at the age of 6 with
one hand and put him up on the dresser.

788
01:10:25,295 --> 01:10:27,627
He laughed so hard at that.

789
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:31,565
Very funny.

790
01:10:37,508 --> 01:10:41,239
And then he died
just when I started school, so...

791
01:10:41,412 --> 01:10:44,438
So I sort of had to make
me own way, as it were.

792
01:10:44,882 --> 01:10:47,112
But enough of me. What about you?

793
01:11:04,301 --> 01:11:09,398
This is mad. At this rate, we'll be
the only ones in our year without dates.

794
01:11:11,675 --> 01:11:14,405
Well, us and Neville.

795
01:11:14,578 --> 01:11:17,240
Yeah, but, then again,
he can take himself.

796
01:11:17,981 --> 01:11:21,314
It might interest you to know
that Neville's already got someone.

797
01:11:23,787 --> 01:11:25,550
Now I'm really depressed.

798
01:11:31,395 --> 01:11:34,853
"Get a move on or all the good ones
will have gone."

799
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:38,868
Who you going with, then?

800
01:11:41,605 --> 01:11:43,300
- Oi, Angelina?
- What?

801
01:11:43,474 --> 01:11:48,776
Do you wanna go to the ball with me?

802
01:11:49,113 --> 01:11:50,842
To the ball?

803
01:11:51,014 --> 01:11:52,481
Yeah, all right.

804
01:11:56,186 --> 01:11:57,744
Oi, Hermione.

805
01:11:57,921 --> 01:11:59,548
You're a girl.

806
01:11:59,723 --> 01:12:01,054
Very well spotted.

807
01:12:01,225 --> 01:12:03,159
Come with one of us?

808
01:12:07,798 --> 01:12:10,699
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke
to show up alone.

809
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,358
For a girl, it's just sad.

810
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:16,302
I won't be going alone, because,
believe it or not, someone's asked me!

811
01:12:23,247 --> 01:12:25,238
And I said yes!

812
01:12:27,084 --> 01:12:28,676
Bloody hell.

813
01:12:28,852 --> 01:12:30,513
She's lying, right?

814
01:12:30,687 --> 01:12:31,915
If you say so.

815
01:12:32,623 --> 01:12:35,922
Look, we've just gotta
grit our teeth and do it.

816
01:12:36,093 --> 01:12:39,995
Tonight, when we get back to the common
room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?

817
01:12:40,164 --> 01:12:41,722
Agreed.

818
01:13:06,089 --> 01:13:07,420
- Cho!
- Harry!

819
01:13:10,994 --> 01:13:13,724
Watch yourself on the stairs.
It's a bit icy at the top.

820
01:13:13,897 --> 01:13:15,489
Okay, thanks.

821
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:20,995
Cho?

822
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:23,497
Yes?

823
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:27,105
Well, I just wondered if you...

824
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:29,939
I wondered if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

825
01:13:31,748 --> 01:13:34,012
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

826
01:13:34,918 --> 01:13:39,821
I was just wondering if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

827
01:13:45,863 --> 01:13:47,421
Harry...

828
01:13:47,598 --> 01:13:50,431
...l'm sorry, but someone's
already asked me.

829
01:13:51,435 --> 01:13:52,868
And...

830
01:13:53,537 --> 01:13:56,768
Well, I've said I'll go with him.

831
01:13:58,442 --> 01:14:01,002
Okay. Yeah. Great.

832
01:14:02,312 --> 01:14:05,042
Fine. No problem.

833
01:14:05,349 --> 01:14:06,941
Okay. Good.

834
01:14:08,218 --> 01:14:09,947
Harry?

835
01:14:10,587 --> 01:14:12,384
I really am...

836
01:14:12,556 --> 01:14:14,183
...sorry.

837
01:14:23,967 --> 01:14:25,457
It's all right, Ron.

838
01:14:25,636 --> 01:14:28,833
It's okay, Ron. It's all right.
It doesn't matter.

839
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:30,871
What happened to you?

840
01:14:31,141 --> 01:14:33,302
He just asked Fleur Delacour out.

841
01:14:33,477 --> 01:14:35,968
- What?
- What did she say?

842
01:14:36,146 --> 01:14:37,511
No, of course.

843
01:14:39,082 --> 01:14:42,415
- She said yes?
- Don't be silly.

844
01:14:42,819 --> 01:14:47,256
There she was, walking by.
You know how I like it when they walk.

845
01:14:47,991 --> 01:14:51,620
I couldn't help it.
It just sort of slipped out.

846
01:14:51,795 --> 01:14:55,253
Actually, he sort of screamed at her.
It was a bit frightening.

847
01:14:56,433 --> 01:15:00,028
- And what did you do then?
- What else? I ran for it.

848
01:15:00,203 --> 01:15:03,934
I'm not cut out for this, Harry.
I don't know what got into me.

849
01:15:04,107 --> 01:15:05,335
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

850
01:15:05,509 --> 01:15:08,569
I always liked looking at them
from behind.

851
01:15:09,913 --> 01:15:12,473
She's never gonna forgive me, ever.

852
01:15:13,116 --> 01:15:14,105
Hey!

853
01:15:31,201 --> 01:15:32,896
Bloody hell.

854
01:15:35,138 --> 01:15:36,901
Bloody hell.

855
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:41,707
Bloody...

856
01:15:41,878 --> 01:15:43,106
Oh, bloody...

857
01:15:46,817 --> 01:15:49,513
What are those? What are those?

858
01:15:49,686 --> 01:15:52,712
- My dress robes.
- Well, they're all right!

859
01:15:52,889 --> 01:15:55,824
No lace. No dodgy little collar.

860
01:15:55,993 --> 01:15:57,927
Well, I expect yours are more traditional.

861
01:15:58,095 --> 01:16:03,123
Traditional?! They're ancient!
I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!

862
01:16:05,502 --> 01:16:08,562
I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.

863
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:15,141
Murder me, Harry.

864
01:16:16,546 --> 01:16:18,104
Leave it alone!

865
01:16:19,082 --> 01:16:22,518
Poor kid. I bet she's alone in her room,
crying her eyes out.

866
01:16:22,686 --> 01:16:25,154
- Who?
- Hermione, of course.

867
01:16:25,322 --> 01:16:28,917
Come on, Harry, why do you think she
wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?

868
01:16:29,092 --> 01:16:31,287
Because we'd take the mickey out of her
if she did.

869
01:16:31,461 --> 01:16:36,558
Nobody asked her. Would've taken her
myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.

870
01:16:37,534 --> 01:16:38,933
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, boys.

871
01:16:39,102 --> 01:16:40,933
Don't you look...

872
01:16:41,505 --> 01:16:42,699
...dashing.

873
01:16:43,273 --> 01:16:46,436
There you are, Potter.
Are you and Miss Patil ready?

874
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:48,441
- Ready, professor?
- To dance.

875
01:16:48,612 --> 01:16:51,638
It's traditional that the three champions...
Well, in this case, four.

876
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:52,873
- Are the first to dance.

877
01:16:53,216 --> 01:16:55,844
- Surely I told you that.
- No.

878
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:58,149
Well, now you know.

879
01:16:59,656 --> 01:17:03,956
As for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed
into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.

880
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:06,527
- Oh, there you are.
- Come on, then.

881
01:17:06,696 --> 01:17:08,186
Come along this way.

882
01:17:13,070 --> 01:17:14,901
Oh, come on.

883
01:17:15,739 --> 01:17:17,730
- Hi.
- Now, I need you all to line up...

884
01:17:17,908 --> 01:17:21,275
...in the procession, please.
Oh, you are very late.

885
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,880
This way. This way. Come along.

886
01:17:27,584 --> 01:17:29,814
She looks beautiful!

887
01:17:29,986 --> 01:17:31,578
Yeah, she does.

888
01:18:18,969 --> 01:18:22,530
Is that Hermione Granger?
With Viktor Krum?

889
01:18:23,173 --> 01:18:25,733
No. Absolutely not.

890
01:18:30,447 --> 01:18:32,005
Hi!

891
01:18:40,757 --> 01:18:42,748
Harry, take my waist.

892
01:18:43,627 --> 01:18:45,060
- What?
- Now!

893
01:19:51,628 --> 01:19:53,493
Are you ready?

894
01:19:54,064 --> 01:19:56,328
Move your body like a hairy troll

895
01:19:57,100 --> 01:19:59,568
Learning to rock and roll

896
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:02,564
Spin around like a crazy elf

897
01:20:03,073 --> 01:20:05,303
Dancing by himself

898
01:20:05,609 --> 01:20:08,942
Boogie down like a unicorn

899
01:20:09,112 --> 01:20:11,546
No stopping till the break of dawn

900
01:20:11,715 --> 01:20:14,548
Put your hands up in the air

901
01:20:14,751 --> 01:20:17,515
Like an ogre who just don't care

902
01:20:18,221 --> 01:20:20,883
Can you dance like a Hippogriff?

903
01:20:23,226 --> 01:20:25,421
Ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?

904
01:20:27,597 --> 01:20:30,998
I don't think it was the books
that had him going to the library.

905
01:20:32,936 --> 01:20:34,460
May I have your arm?

906
01:20:34,638 --> 01:20:37,368
Arm. Leg. I'm yours.

907
01:21:03,266 --> 01:21:04,858
Hot, isn't it?

908
01:21:05,535 --> 01:21:08,868
Viktor's gone to go and get drinks.
Would you care to join us?

909
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:12,736
No, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.

910
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:16,743
What's got your wand in a knot?

911
01:21:17,047 --> 01:21:20,744
He's a Durmstrang.
You're fraternizing with the enemy.

912
01:21:20,917 --> 01:21:24,478
The enemy?
Who was it wanting his autograph?

913
01:21:25,188 --> 01:21:27,622
Besides, the whole point
of the tournament...

914
01:21:27,791 --> 01:21:31,318
...is international
magical cooperation...

915
01:21:31,895 --> 01:21:33,453
...to make friends.

916
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:37,293
I think he's got a bit more
than friendship on his mind.

917
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:49,609
Are you going to ask me
to dance or not?

918
01:21:49,779 --> 01:21:51,212
No.

919
01:21:59,456 --> 01:22:01,890
- He's using you.
- How dare you?!

920
01:22:02,058 --> 01:22:06,256
- Besides, I can take care of myself.
- I doubt it. He's way too old.

921
01:22:06,429 --> 01:22:10,092
- What?! What? That's what you think?
- Yeah, that's what I think.

922
01:22:10,266 --> 01:22:12,393
You know the solution then, don't you?

923
01:22:12,569 --> 01:22:14,560
- Go on.
- Next time there's a ball...

924
01:22:14,738 --> 01:22:17,866
...pluck up the courage and ask me
before somebody else does!

925
01:22:18,041 --> 01:22:20,066
And not as a last resort.

926
01:22:20,243 --> 01:22:24,441
Well, that's... I mean,
that's just completely off the point.

927
01:22:24,614 --> 01:22:25,945
Harry.

928
01:22:26,416 --> 01:22:27,713
Where have you been?

929
01:22:27,884 --> 01:22:30,375
Never mind! Off to bed, both of you.

930
01:22:33,189 --> 01:22:37,216
- They get scary when they get older.
- Ron, you spoiled everything!

931
01:22:37,394 --> 01:22:39,259
What's this about?

932
01:22:43,533 --> 01:22:46,525
No, don't let

933
01:22:48,338 --> 01:22:52,672
This magic die

934
01:22:54,444 --> 01:22:57,208
The answer's there

935
01:23:55,538 --> 01:23:57,631
Let me see it again.

936
01:23:58,942 --> 01:24:01,877
Yes, the time is close now.

937
01:24:06,549 --> 01:24:08,414
Harry, at last!

938
01:24:09,719 --> 01:24:15,055
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

939
01:24:25,668 --> 01:24:27,067
You all right, Harry?

940
01:24:28,505 --> 01:24:30,268
I just got in.

941
01:24:30,874 --> 01:24:32,102
Me.

942
01:24:43,386 --> 01:24:46,651
Harry, you told me
you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.

943
01:24:46,823 --> 01:24:51,021
- The task is two days from now.
- Really? I had no idea.

944
01:24:52,562 --> 01:24:54,359
I suppose Viktor's
already figured it out.

945
01:24:54,531 --> 01:24:57,364
Wouldn't know. We don't actually
talk about the tournament.

946
01:24:58,568 --> 01:25:03,164
Actually, we don't really talk at all.
Viktor's more of a physical being.

947
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:10,107
I just mean he's not
particularly loquacious.

948
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:12,810
Mostly, he watches me study.

949
01:25:13,616 --> 01:25:15,709
It's a bit annoying, actually.

950
01:25:17,086 --> 01:25:19,782
You are trying to figure this egg out,
aren't you?

951
01:25:20,623 --> 01:25:22,147
What's that supposed to mean?

952
01:25:22,725 --> 01:25:25,694
It just means these tasks
are designed to test you...

953
01:25:25,895 --> 01:25:29,058
...in the most brutal way.
They're almost cruel.

954
01:25:30,199 --> 01:25:31,826
And...

955
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:36,070
...l'm scared for you.

956
01:25:37,006 --> 01:25:39,600
You got by the dragons mostly on nerve.

957
01:25:40,209 --> 01:25:42,700
I'm not sure it's going
to be enough this time.

958
01:25:42,879 --> 01:25:44,574
Hey, Potter!

959
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,810
- Potter!
- Cedric.

960
01:25:54,524 --> 01:25:56,185
How...? How are you?

961
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:58,659
Spectacular.

962
01:26:00,196 --> 01:26:04,030
I realize I never really thanked you properly
for tipping me off about those dragons.

963
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,532
Forget it. I'm sure you
would've done the same for me.

964
01:26:06,836 --> 01:26:08,394
Exactly.

965
01:26:09,505 --> 01:26:12,065
You know the Prefects' bathroom
on the fifth floor?

966
01:26:15,912 --> 01:26:18,506
It's not a bad place for a bath.

967
01:26:20,883 --> 01:26:22,783
Just take your egg...

968
01:26:23,519 --> 01:26:26,249
...and mull things over
in the hot water.

969
01:27:01,457 --> 01:27:03,618
I must be out of my mind.

970
01:27:13,836 --> 01:27:15,997
I'm definitely out of my mind.

971
01:27:18,675 --> 01:27:21,940
I'd try putting it in the water
if I were you.

972
01:27:22,111 --> 01:27:24,011
Myrtle!

973
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:25,909
Hello, Harry.

974
01:27:26,649 --> 01:27:29,914
Long time no see.

975
01:27:34,190 --> 01:27:37,853
I was circling a blocked drain
the other day...

976
01:27:38,027 --> 01:27:41,463
...and could swear I saw a bit
of Polyjuice Potion.

977
01:27:41,631 --> 01:27:43,963
Not being a bad boy again,
are you, Harry?

978
01:27:44,133 --> 01:27:45,896
Polyjuice Potion?

979
01:27:46,669 --> 01:27:50,696
Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say,
"Try putting it in the water"?

980
01:27:57,513 --> 01:27:59,208
That's what he did.

981
01:28:00,049 --> 01:28:01,710
The other boy...

982
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:05,178
...the handsome one...

983
01:28:06,489 --> 01:28:07,717
...Cedric.

984
01:28:11,127 --> 01:28:13,789
Well, go on. Open it.

985
01:28:21,904 --> 01:28:26,898
Come seek us
Where our voices sound

986
01:28:27,076 --> 01:28:31,740
We cannot sing
Above the ground

987
01:28:31,914 --> 01:28:36,283
An hour long you'll have to look

988
01:28:37,019 --> 01:28:41,683
To recover what we took

989
01:28:49,866 --> 01:28:51,094
Myrtle...

990
01:28:52,769 --> 01:28:56,205
...there aren't merpeople
in the Black Lake, are there?

991
01:28:57,106 --> 01:28:58,767
Very good.

992
01:28:59,642 --> 01:29:04,011
It took Cedric ages to riddle it out.

993
01:29:04,514 --> 01:29:08,280
Almost all the bubbles were gone.

994
01:29:25,935 --> 01:29:27,903
Harry, tell me again.

995
01:29:29,605 --> 01:29:32,438
"Come seek us
where our voices sound."

996
01:29:32,608 --> 01:29:35,168
The Black Lake, that's obvious.

997
01:29:36,145 --> 01:29:38,670
"An hour long you'll have to look."

998
01:29:38,848 --> 01:29:42,306
Again, obvious. Though, admittedly,
potentially problematic.

999
01:29:43,686 --> 01:29:45,551
"Potentially problematic"?

1000
01:29:45,721 --> 01:29:48,986
When's the last time you held your breath
underwater for an hour, Hermione?

1001
01:29:49,525 --> 01:29:53,859
Look, Harry, we can do this.
The three of us can figure it out.

1002
01:29:54,030 --> 01:29:56,521
Hate to break up the skull session.

1003
01:29:56,699 --> 01:29:58,690
Professor McGonagall
wants you in her office.

1004
01:29:58,935 --> 01:30:01,335
Not you, Potter,
just Weasley and Granger.

1005
01:30:01,504 --> 01:30:04,166
But, sir, the second task
is only hours away, and...

1006
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:06,934
Exactly. Presumably Potter
is well prepared by now...

1007
01:30:07,109 --> 01:30:08,974
...and could do with
a good night's sleep.

1008
01:30:09,145 --> 01:30:11,636
Go. Now!

1009
01:30:21,624 --> 01:30:23,421
Longbottom!

1010
01:30:23,593 --> 01:30:25,618
Why don't you help Potter
put his books back.

1011
01:30:34,270 --> 01:30:36,465
You know,
if you're interested in plants...

1012
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:39,233
...you'd be better off with
Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.

1013
01:30:39,842 --> 01:30:44,176
Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal
who's growing gravity-resistant trees?

1014
01:30:44,347 --> 01:30:48,078
Neville, no offense,
but I really don't care...

1015
01:30:48,684 --> 01:30:50,413
...about plants.

1016
01:30:50,753 --> 01:30:52,448
Now, if there's...

1017
01:30:52,622 --> 01:30:57,423
...a Tibetan turnip that will allow me
to breathe underwater for an hour...

1018
01:30:57,593 --> 01:31:00,084
...then great. But otherwise...

1019
01:31:00,263 --> 01:31:04,063
I don't know about a turnip.
But you could always use gillyweed.

1020
01:31:05,234 --> 01:31:08,135
- Any bets? Any bets?
- Come on, place your bets!

1021
01:31:08,304 --> 01:31:09,771
Step up, mates! Don't be shy.

1022
01:31:09,939 --> 01:31:11,372
- Three lads.
- One lady.

1023
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:13,701
- Four go down.
- But do four come up?

1024
01:31:13,876 --> 01:31:15,400
Don't be so mean.

1025
01:31:16,012 --> 01:31:17,843
- Any bets?
- Fleur's 10-1.

1026
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:22,007
- You're sure about this, Neville?
- Absolutely.

1027
01:31:22,184 --> 01:31:24,118
- For an hour?
- Most likely.

1028
01:31:24,287 --> 01:31:25,777
Most likely?

1029
01:31:25,955 --> 01:31:28,150
Well, there is some debate
among herbologists...

1030
01:31:28,324 --> 01:31:30,792
...as to the effects of fresh water
versus salt water...

1031
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:33,622
You're telling me this now?
You must be joking!

1032
01:31:33,796 --> 01:31:35,764
I just wanted to help.

1033
01:31:35,932 --> 01:31:39,026
Well, that makes you a right sight
better than Ron and Hermione.

1034
01:31:39,201 --> 01:31:40,964
Where are they anyway?

1035
01:31:41,137 --> 01:31:44,163
- You seem a little tense, Harry.
- Do I?

1036
01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:53,410
Welcome to the second task.

1037
01:31:53,582 --> 01:31:57,279
Last night, something was stolen
from each of our champions.

1038
01:31:57,453 --> 01:31:58,818
A treasure of sorts.

1039
01:31:58,988 --> 01:32:01,616
These four treasures,
one for each champion...

1040
01:32:01,791 --> 01:32:04,487
...now lie on the bottom
of the Black Lake.

1041
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:06,218
In order to win...

1042
01:32:06,395 --> 01:32:10,229
...each champion need only find
their treasure and return to the surface.

1043
01:32:10,399 --> 01:32:13,027
- Simple enough, except for this:
- Put that in your mouth.

1044
01:32:13,202 --> 01:32:16,831
They will have but one hour to do so,
and one hour only.

1045
01:32:17,006 --> 01:32:20,942
After that, they'll be on their own.
No magic will save them.

1046
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:23,674
You may begin
at the sound of the cannon.

1047
01:32:50,206 --> 01:32:53,141
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know, I can't see him.

1048
01:32:54,477 --> 01:32:57,469
Oh, my God.
I've killed Harry Potter.

1049
01:32:59,315 --> 01:33:01,215
Yeah!

1050
01:33:02,385 --> 01:33:04,012
What?

1051
01:34:23,599 --> 01:34:25,726
The Beauxbatons champion,
Miss Delacour...

1052
01:34:25,901 --> 01:34:28,426
...has unfortunately
been forced to retire...

1053
01:34:29,071 --> 01:34:32,165
...so she will take no further part
in this task.

1054
01:35:49,952 --> 01:35:51,817
But she's my friend too!

1055
01:35:53,389 --> 01:35:55,118
Only one!

1056
01:36:46,475 --> 01:36:48,340
Let's get down below.

1057
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:01,187
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1058
01:37:58,714 --> 01:38:00,443
Yes!

1059
01:38:18,567 --> 01:38:20,626
Ascendio!

1060
01:38:25,874 --> 01:38:27,569
Harry!

1061
01:38:29,878 --> 01:38:31,345
He's all right.

1062
01:38:32,548 --> 01:38:33,981
He's all right. Barty!

1063
01:38:34,149 --> 01:38:37,585
- Go get him another towel.
- I want all the judges over here now!

1064
01:38:38,187 --> 01:38:41,679
You saved her, even though
she wasn't yours to save.

1065
01:38:42,324 --> 01:38:44,019
My little sister.

1066
01:38:44,426 --> 01:38:45,984
Thank you.

1067
01:38:46,795 --> 01:38:49,525
And you! You helped.

1068
01:38:50,165 --> 01:38:53,191
Well, yeah, a bit.

1069
01:39:00,409 --> 01:39:01,569
- Harry!
- Hermione!

1070
01:39:01,744 --> 01:39:04,406
Are you all right? You must be freezing.

1071
01:39:05,647 --> 01:39:07,581
Personally, I think you behaved admirably.

1072
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:09,775
I finished last, Hermione.

1073
01:39:10,619 --> 01:39:14,749
Next to last.
Fleur never got past the Grindylows.

1074
01:39:14,923 --> 01:39:18,154
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1075
01:39:18,327 --> 01:39:21,228
- Come on! Come on!
- Attention!

1076
01:39:23,565 --> 01:39:26,159
Attention!

1077
01:39:26,635 --> 01:39:30,503
The winner is Mr. Diggory...

1078
01:39:30,939 --> 01:39:34,431
...who showed innate command
of the Bubble-Head Charm.

1079
01:39:34,610 --> 01:39:37,272
However, seeing as Mr. Potter
would have finished first...

1080
01:39:37,446 --> 01:39:42,406
...had it not been for his determination
to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...

1081
01:39:42,584 --> 01:39:46,850
...but the others as well,
we've agreed to award him...

1082
01:39:47,022 --> 01:39:49,013
...second place...

1083
01:39:49,191 --> 01:39:50,681
- Second place!
- Well done!

1084
01:39:50,859 --> 01:39:53,487
...for outstanding moral fiber!

1085
01:39:54,763 --> 01:39:56,287
Yes!

1086
01:39:59,802 --> 01:40:01,599
- Right on.
- All that moral fiber, eh?

1087
01:40:01,770 --> 01:40:03,397
- It's great.
- Moral fiber?

1088
01:40:03,572 --> 01:40:05,938
Blimey. Even when you go wrong,
it turns out right.

1089
01:40:06,108 --> 01:40:08,770
- Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber.
- Congratulations, Potter.

1090
01:40:08,944 --> 01:40:10,605
- A fine achievement.
- Thank you.

1091
01:40:10,779 --> 01:40:12,303
Well done, boy.

1092
01:40:12,481 --> 01:40:15,712
- See you at Hagrid's, Harry.
- I'm sorry we haven't spoken.

1093
01:40:15,884 --> 01:40:19,877
After all, your story is one
I've heard so many times.

1094
01:40:20,889 --> 01:40:24,347
Quite remarkable, really.
Tragic, of course...

1095
01:40:24,526 --> 01:40:26,517
...to lose one's family.

1096
01:40:28,530 --> 01:40:30,691
Never whole again, are we?

1097
01:40:32,935 --> 01:40:35,028
Still, life goes on...

1098
01:40:35,704 --> 01:40:37,365
...and here we stand.

1099
01:40:40,242 --> 01:40:42,972
I'm sure your parents would be
very proud of you today, Potter.

1100
01:40:43,145 --> 01:40:44,612
Bartemius!

1101
01:40:44,780 --> 01:40:48,910
Not trying to lure Potter into one of
the Ministry's summer internships, are we?

1102
01:40:49,084 --> 01:40:52,281
The last boy who went into
the Department of Mysteries never came out!

1103
01:41:04,766 --> 01:41:06,666
And they say I'm mad.

1104
01:41:15,944 --> 01:41:19,675
Now, I remember...
I remember when I first met you all.

1105
01:41:19,848 --> 01:41:22,874
Biggest bunch of misfits
I ever set eyes on.

1106
01:41:23,385 --> 01:41:25,945
Suppose you remind me of meself a little.

1107
01:41:26,121 --> 01:41:30,148
- And here we all are, four years later.
- We're still a bunch of misfits.

1108
01:41:30,325 --> 01:41:33,658
Well, maybe,
but we've all got each other.

1109
01:41:33,829 --> 01:41:35,387
And Harry, of course.

1110
01:41:35,564 --> 01:41:40,934
Soon to be the youngest
Triwizard champion there's ever been!

1111
01:41:41,136 --> 01:41:43,161
Hooray!

1112
01:41:44,606 --> 01:41:47,097
Hogwarts, Hogwarts
Hoggy Warty Hogwarts

1113
01:41:47,276 --> 01:41:49,904
Teach us something, please

1114
01:41:59,888 --> 01:42:01,378
Mr. Crouch?

1115
01:42:08,463 --> 01:42:12,058
A man has died here, Fudge. And he
won't be the last. You must take action.

1116
01:42:12,234 --> 01:42:13,792
I will not.

1117
01:42:13,969 --> 01:42:18,030
In times like these, the wizard world looks
to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!

1118
01:42:18,206 --> 01:42:19,537
Then for once show them some!

1119
01:42:19,708 --> 01:42:23,804
The Triwizard Tournament will not be
canceled. I will not be seen as a coward!

1120
01:42:23,979 --> 01:42:27,176
A true leader does what is right,
no matter what others think.

1121
01:42:27,349 --> 01:42:30,147
- What did you say to me?
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1122
01:42:30,319 --> 01:42:33,982
It may interest you to know
this conversation is no longer private.

1123
01:42:38,327 --> 01:42:39,885
Oh, Harry!

1124
01:42:40,062 --> 01:42:42,360
Harry, how good to see you again.

1125
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:44,722
I can come back later, professor.

1126
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:48,233
Not necessary, Harry. The minister and I
are done. I'll be back in a moment.

1127
01:42:48,403 --> 01:42:50,963
Minister, after you.

1128
01:42:51,506 --> 01:42:53,497
There you are. Your hat.

1129
01:42:53,675 --> 01:42:57,338
Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in
a little Licorice Snap in my absence.

1130
01:42:57,512 --> 01:43:00,743
But I have to warn you,
they're a wee bit sharp.

1131
01:44:32,174 --> 01:44:33,766
Professor?

1132
01:44:33,942 --> 01:44:36,467
- Professor.
- Yeah.

1133
01:44:47,389 --> 01:44:51,155
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought
from Azkaban at your own request...

1134
01:44:51,326 --> 01:44:53,260
...to present evidence to this council.

1135
01:44:53,428 --> 01:44:56,124
Should your testimony
prove consequential...

1136
01:44:56,298 --> 01:45:00,359
...council may be prepared
to order your immediate release.

1137
01:45:00,535 --> 01:45:05,131
Until such time, you remain in the eyes
of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.

1138
01:45:05,307 --> 01:45:07,002
Do you accept these terms?

1139
01:45:07,576 --> 01:45:10,272
- I do, sir.
- And what do you wish to present?

1140
01:45:10,612 --> 01:45:13,080
I have names, sir.

1141
01:45:13,615 --> 01:45:17,210
There was Rosier, Evan Rosier.

1142
01:45:19,888 --> 01:45:22,413
- Rosier is dead.
- He took a piece of me with him...

1143
01:45:22,591 --> 01:45:24,718
...though, didn't he?
- I didn't know.

1144
01:45:24,893 --> 01:45:27,521
- Lf that is all the witness has to offer...
- No, no, no.

1145
01:45:27,696 --> 01:45:30,995
There was Rookwood! He was a spy.

1146
01:45:31,166 --> 01:45:33,532
Augustus Rookwood?
Of the Department of Mysteries?

1147
01:45:33,702 --> 01:45:34,896
Yeah, the same.

1148
01:45:35,070 --> 01:45:38,733
He passed information to You-Know-Who
from inside the Ministry itself.

1149
01:45:39,975 --> 01:45:43,240
Very well. Council will deliberate.

1150
01:45:43,411 --> 01:45:45,379
In the meantime,
you will return to Azkaban.

1151
01:45:45,547 --> 01:45:50,280
No! Wait! Wait, please! Please, I have more!
What about Snape? Severus Snape?

1152
01:45:50,452 --> 01:45:53,421
As the council is aware,
I've given evidence on this matter.

1153
01:45:53,588 --> 01:45:57,547
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater
and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall...

1154
01:45:57,726 --> 01:46:00,718
...turned spy for us at great personal risk.
- It's a lie!

1155
01:46:00,896 --> 01:46:04,332
- Today he's no more a Death Eater than I am.
- Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!

1156
01:46:04,499 --> 01:46:06,797
Silence!

1157
01:46:07,402 --> 01:46:10,838
Unless the witness possesses
any genuine name of consequence...

1158
01:46:11,006 --> 01:46:13,133
...this session is now concluded.

1159
01:46:13,308 --> 01:46:15,401
Oh, no, no, no.

1160
01:46:16,311 --> 01:46:17,778
I've heard about one more.

1161
01:46:17,946 --> 01:46:20,506
- What's that?
- The name.

1162
01:46:20,682 --> 01:46:22,149
- Yes?
- I know for a fact...

1163
01:46:22,317 --> 01:46:24,342
...this person took part
in the capture...

1164
01:46:24,519 --> 01:46:26,680
...and, by means
of the Cruciatus Curse...

1165
01:46:26,855 --> 01:46:30,347
...torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom
and his wife!

1166
01:46:30,525 --> 01:46:32,857
The name.
Give me the wretched name!

1167
01:46:33,028 --> 01:46:35,553
Barty Crouch...

1168
01:46:38,266 --> 01:46:39,290
...Junior.

1169
01:46:48,777 --> 01:46:50,472
Hold him down!

1170
01:46:54,115 --> 01:46:57,744
Get your filthy hands off me,
you pathetic little men!

1171
01:46:59,454 --> 01:47:01,046
Hello, Father.

1172
01:47:02,457 --> 01:47:04,516
You are no son of mine.

1173
01:47:15,837 --> 01:47:20,297
Curiosity is not a sin, Harry.
But you should exercise caution.

1174
01:47:21,676 --> 01:47:23,075
It's a Pensieve.

1175
01:47:23,245 --> 01:47:27,909
Very useful if, like me,
you find your mind a wee bit stretched.

1176
01:47:28,083 --> 01:47:31,610
It allows me to see once more
things I've already seen.

1177
01:47:32,087 --> 01:47:35,056
You see, Harry, I have searched
and searched for something...

1178
01:47:35,223 --> 01:47:36,781
...some small detail...

1179
01:47:38,193 --> 01:47:40,320
...something I might have overlooked...

1180
01:47:40,495 --> 01:47:44,693
...something that would explain why
these terrible things have happened.

1181
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:49,368
Every time I get close to an answer,
it slips away.

1182
01:47:50,438 --> 01:47:52,030
It's maddening.

1183
01:47:54,376 --> 01:47:56,139
Sir? Mr. Crouch's son.

1184
01:47:56,912 --> 01:47:58,971
What exactly happened to him?

1185
01:47:59,147 --> 01:48:03,948
He was sent to Azkaban.
Destroyed Barty to do it.

1186
01:48:04,619 --> 01:48:08,214
But he had no choice.
The evidence was overwhelming.

1187
01:48:09,691 --> 01:48:12,683
- Why do you ask?
- It's just that I...

1188
01:48:13,428 --> 01:48:15,521
I had a dream about him.

1189
01:48:17,799 --> 01:48:20,597
It was in the summer, before school.

1190
01:48:22,737 --> 01:48:25,729
In the dream, I was in a house.

1191
01:48:25,941 --> 01:48:30,708
And Voldemort was there,
only he wasn't quite human.

1192
01:48:30,879 --> 01:48:34,508
And Wormtail was there too.
And Mr. Crouch's son.

1193
01:48:34,883 --> 01:48:37,716
- Have there been others like this dream?
- Yes.

1194
01:48:38,553 --> 01:48:40,180
Always the same one.

1195
01:48:43,224 --> 01:48:45,556
Sir, these dreams...

1196
01:48:45,727 --> 01:48:50,926
...what I see, you don't think
it's actually happening, do you?

1197
01:48:52,567 --> 01:48:55,536
I think it's unwise for you
to linger over these dreams, Harry.

1198
01:48:56,037 --> 01:48:58,005
I think it's best if you simply...

1199
01:49:03,645 --> 01:49:05,408
...cast them away.

1200
01:49:14,689 --> 01:49:18,648
It's a sign, Severus.
You know what it means as well as I.

1201
01:49:27,369 --> 01:49:28,563
Potter!

1202
01:49:28,737 --> 01:49:31,262
What's your hurry?

1203
01:49:36,378 --> 01:49:40,144
Congratulations, your performance
in the Black Lake was inspiring.

1204
01:49:40,315 --> 01:49:42,579
Gillyweed, am I correct?

1205
01:49:43,351 --> 01:49:44,875
Yes, sir.

1206
01:49:45,820 --> 01:49:47,219
Ingenious.

1207
01:49:49,057 --> 01:49:53,016
A rather rare herb, gillyweed.

1208
01:49:53,828 --> 01:49:57,320
Not something found
in your everyday garden.

1209
01:49:59,034 --> 01:50:00,968
Nor is this.

1210
01:50:05,173 --> 01:50:06,834
Know what it is?

1211
01:50:08,143 --> 01:50:09,576
Bubble juice, sir?

1212
01:50:10,145 --> 01:50:12,045
Veritaserum.

1213
01:50:12,781 --> 01:50:16,478
Three drops of this and You-Know-Who
himself would spill his darkest secrets.

1214
01:50:16,651 --> 01:50:21,816
The use of it on a student is,
regrettably, forbidden. However...

1215
01:50:22,490 --> 01:50:25,516
...should you ever steal
from my personal stores again...

1216
01:50:25,693 --> 01:50:30,562
...my hand might just slip over
your morning pumpkin juice.

1217
01:50:30,732 --> 01:50:35,135
- I haven't stolen anything.
- Don't lie to me.

1218
01:50:36,271 --> 01:50:41,971
Gillyweed may be innocuous,
but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?

1219
01:50:42,677 --> 01:50:46,010
You and your little friends are brewing
Polyjuice Potion, and believe me...

1220
01:50:46,181 --> 01:50:48,376
...l'm going to find out why!

1221
01:51:15,210 --> 01:51:16,802
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1222
01:51:35,997 --> 01:51:37,521
Sonorus!

1223
01:51:41,769 --> 01:51:47,105
Earlier today, Professor Moody placed
the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.

1224
01:51:47,275 --> 01:51:52,235
Only he knows its exact position.
Now, as Mr. Diggory...

1225
01:51:54,349 --> 01:51:56,146
...and Mr. Potter...

1226
01:51:58,019 --> 01:51:59,748
...are tied for first position...

1227
01:51:59,921 --> 01:52:04,051
...they will be the first to enter the maze,
followed by Mr. Krum...

1228
01:52:05,293 --> 01:52:08,751
...and Miss Delacour.
- Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!

1229
01:52:09,631 --> 01:52:12,725
The first person to touch the cup
will be the winner!

1230
01:52:17,071 --> 01:52:19,801
I've instructed the staff
to patrol the perimeter.

1231
01:52:19,974 --> 01:52:22,909
Should, at any point, a contestant wish
to withdraw from the task...

1232
01:52:23,077 --> 01:52:27,571
...he or she need only send up
red sparks with their wands.

1233
01:52:27,916 --> 01:52:31,818
Contestants! Gather around. Quickly!

1234
01:52:34,956 --> 01:52:39,290
In the maze, you'll find no dragons
or creatures of the deep.

1235
01:52:39,460 --> 01:52:42,827
Instead, you'll face something
even more challenging.

1236
01:52:42,997 --> 01:52:46,023
You see, people change in the maze.

1237
01:52:46,201 --> 01:52:47,896
Oh, find the cup if you can.

1238
01:52:48,069 --> 01:52:52,836
But be very wary, you could just
lose yourselves along the way.

1239
01:52:54,309 --> 01:52:57,301
Champions, prepare yourselves!

1240
01:53:06,354 --> 01:53:07,821
Good luck.

1241
01:53:08,223 --> 01:53:10,157
- My boy.
- See you later, Dad.

1242
01:53:12,527 --> 01:53:15,121
On the count of three. One...

1243
01:56:42,904 --> 01:56:44,132
Fleur?

1244
01:56:45,807 --> 01:56:47,240
Fleur.

1245
01:56:50,812 --> 01:56:52,643
Periculum!

1246
01:57:31,319 --> 01:57:32,786
Get down!

1247
01:57:33,354 --> 01:57:35,083
Get down!

1248
01:57:35,723 --> 01:57:36,951
Expelliarmus!

1249
01:57:46,567 --> 01:57:49,764
No, don't! Stop!
He's bewitched, Cedric!

1250
01:57:49,937 --> 01:57:51,996
- Get off me!
- He's bewitched!

1251
01:58:03,618 --> 01:58:05,313
Yes.

1252
01:58:26,207 --> 01:58:27,970
Harry!

1253
01:58:30,278 --> 01:58:31,939
Harry!

1254
01:58:34,315 --> 01:58:35,748
Harry!

1255
01:58:38,219 --> 01:58:39,777
Harry!

1256
01:58:41,756 --> 01:58:43,553
Reducto!

1257
01:59:00,341 --> 01:59:02,832
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1258
01:59:03,244 --> 01:59:07,943
You know, for a moment there,
I thought you were gonna let it get me.

1259
01:59:08,115 --> 01:59:09,844
For a moment, so did I.

1260
01:59:11,719 --> 01:59:12,879
Some game, huh?

1261
01:59:13,921 --> 01:59:15,320
Some game.

1262
01:59:20,761 --> 01:59:22,388
Go!

1263
01:59:32,540 --> 01:59:35,566
Go on, take it.
You saved me, take it!

1264
01:59:35,743 --> 01:59:37,734
- Together. One, two...
- Two...

1265
01:59:37,912 --> 01:59:39,140
...three!
...three!

1266
01:59:51,592 --> 01:59:54,527
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

1267
02:00:01,602 --> 02:00:02,933
Where are we?

1268
02:00:08,643 --> 02:00:10,270
I've been here before.

1269
02:00:13,914 --> 02:00:15,506
It's a Portkey.

1270
02:00:17,284 --> 02:00:21,550
- Harry, the cup is a Portkey.
- I've been here before, in a dream.

1271
02:00:23,624 --> 02:00:27,025
Cedric! We have to get back
to the cup. Now!

1272
02:00:27,194 --> 02:00:29,162
What are you talking about?

1273
02:00:34,402 --> 02:00:37,303
- Harry! What is it?
- Get back to the cup!

1274
02:00:44,945 --> 02:00:47,277
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Kill the spare.

1275
02:00:47,448 --> 02:00:50,212
- Avada Kedavra!
- No! Cedric!

1276
02:01:01,529 --> 02:01:03,394
Do it! Now!

1277
02:01:15,342 --> 02:01:17,833
Bone of the father...

1278
02:01:18,012 --> 02:01:20,310
...unwillingly given.

1279
02:01:27,788 --> 02:01:30,814
Flesh of the servant...

1280
02:01:32,860 --> 02:01:36,023
...willingly sacrificed.

1281
02:01:40,134 --> 02:01:43,865
And blood of the enemy...

1282
02:01:49,677 --> 02:01:52,168
...forcibly taken.

1283
02:01:58,219 --> 02:02:01,188
The Dark Lord shall rise...

1284
02:02:01,956 --> 02:02:03,890
...again.

1285
02:03:07,288 --> 02:03:10,689
My wand, Wormtail.

1286
02:03:20,234 --> 02:03:22,202
Hold out your arm.

1287
02:03:22,369 --> 02:03:23,961
Master.

1288
02:03:24,138 --> 02:03:26,766
Thank you, master.

1289
02:03:26,941 --> 02:03:28,408
The other arm, Wormtail.

1290
02:04:09,049 --> 02:04:10,949
Welcome, my friends.

1291
02:04:12,353 --> 02:04:15,117
Thirteen years it's been, and yet...

1292
02:04:15,756 --> 02:04:21,251
...here you stand before me
as though it were only yesterday.

1293
02:04:22,196 --> 02:04:25,131
I confess myself...

1294
02:04:25,599 --> 02:04:27,157
...disappointed.

1295
02:04:27,835 --> 02:04:29,928
Not one of you tried to find me.

1296
02:04:30,104 --> 02:04:33,471
Crabbe! Macnair!

1297
02:04:34,375 --> 02:04:35,706
Goyle!

1298
02:04:38,212 --> 02:04:39,839
Not even you...

1299
02:04:43,717 --> 02:04:45,651
...Lucius.

1300
02:04:47,488 --> 02:04:52,323
My Lord, had I detected any sign,
a whisper of your whereabouts...

1301
02:04:52,493 --> 02:04:55,485
There were signs, my slippery friend.
And more than whispers.

1302
02:04:55,663 --> 02:05:00,828
I assure you, my Lord,
I have never renounced the old ways.

1303
02:05:02,536 --> 02:05:08,168
The face I have been obliged to present
each day since your absence...

1304
02:05:10,177 --> 02:05:12,805
...that is my true mask.

1305
02:05:13,180 --> 02:05:14,738
I returned.

1306
02:05:17,217 --> 02:05:21,119
Out of fear, not loyalty.

1307
02:05:22,256 --> 02:05:28,024
Still, you have proved yourself useful
these past few months, Wormtail.

1308
02:05:33,233 --> 02:05:35,565
Thank you, master.

1309
02:05:36,170 --> 02:05:37,899
Thank you.

1310
02:05:41,008 --> 02:05:43,374
- Such a handsome boy.
- Don't touch him!

1311
02:05:44,845 --> 02:05:46,335
Harry.

1312
02:05:46,513 --> 02:05:49,311
I'd almost forgotten you were here.

1313
02:05:49,483 --> 02:05:53,886
Standing on the bones
of my father. Yeah.

1314
02:05:54,054 --> 02:05:55,419
I'd introduce you...

1315
02:05:55,589 --> 02:05:59,889
...but word has it you're almost
as famous as me these days.

1316
02:06:02,563 --> 02:06:05,225
The boy who lived.

1317
02:06:05,399 --> 02:06:08,300
How lies have fed your legend, Harry.

1318
02:06:08,469 --> 02:06:12,462
Shall I reveal what really happened
that night 13 years ago?

1319
02:06:12,639 --> 02:06:17,372
Shall I divulge how
I truly lost my powers?

1320
02:06:17,544 --> 02:06:19,136
Yes, shall I?

1321
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:20,811
It was love.

1322
02:06:20,981 --> 02:06:25,475
You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter
gave her life for her only son...

1323
02:06:25,652 --> 02:06:28,246
...she provided the ultimate protection.

1324
02:06:28,655 --> 02:06:30,452
I could not touch him.

1325
02:06:31,692 --> 02:06:33,819
It was old magic.

1326
02:06:33,994 --> 02:06:36,258
Something I should have foreseen.

1327
02:06:36,430 --> 02:06:38,227
But no matter, no matter.

1328
02:06:38,399 --> 02:06:40,594
Things have changed.

1329
02:06:41,368 --> 02:06:44,860
I can touch you...

1330
02:06:45,472 --> 02:06:47,201
...now.

1331
02:06:55,349 --> 02:06:56,680
Yeah.

1332
02:07:03,023 --> 02:07:06,720
Astonishing what a few drops
of your blood will do, eh, Harry?

1333
02:07:07,861 --> 02:07:09,590
Pick up your wand, Potter.

1334
02:07:11,198 --> 02:07:13,428
I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!

1335
02:07:15,002 --> 02:07:17,334
You've been taught how to duel,
I presume, yes?

1336
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:19,938
First, we bow to each other.

1337
02:07:20,107 --> 02:07:22,473
Come on, now, Harry.
The niceties must be observed.

1338
02:07:22,643 --> 02:07:25,874
Dumbledore wouldn't want you
to forget your manners, would he?

1339
02:07:26,046 --> 02:07:27,377
I said, bow.

1340
02:07:29,249 --> 02:07:33,583
- That's better. And now...
- No.

1341
02:07:33,987 --> 02:07:35,852
Crucio!

1342
02:07:38,325 --> 02:07:40,054
Crucio!

1343
02:07:41,128 --> 02:07:43,062
Attaboy, Harry.

1344
02:07:43,230 --> 02:07:45,357
Your parents would be proud.

1345
02:07:45,666 --> 02:07:49,067
Especially your filthy Muggle mother.

1346
02:07:49,236 --> 02:07:50,828
Expelliar...

1347
02:07:53,841 --> 02:07:56,241
I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.

1348
02:07:56,410 --> 02:07:58,401
I'm going to destroy you.

1349
02:08:00,614 --> 02:08:06,177
After tonight, no one will ever again
question my powers.

1350
02:08:06,820 --> 02:08:09,380
After tonight, if they speak of you...

1351
02:08:09,556 --> 02:08:12,218
...they'll speak only of how you...

1352
02:08:12,526 --> 02:08:14,357
...begged for death.

1353
02:08:14,528 --> 02:08:18,294
And I, being a merciful Lord...

1354
02:08:18,832 --> 02:08:20,424
...obliged.

1355
02:08:20,767 --> 02:08:22,257
Get up!

1356
02:08:27,274 --> 02:08:29,242
Don't you turn your back on me,
Harry Potter!

1357
02:08:29,409 --> 02:08:31,673
I want you to look at me
when I kill you!

1358
02:08:31,845 --> 02:08:35,042
I want to see the light
leave your eyes!

1359
02:08:48,996 --> 02:08:50,725
Have it your way.

1360
02:08:51,765 --> 02:08:54,165
- Expelliarmus!
- Avada Kedavra!

1361
02:09:11,685 --> 02:09:14,347
Do nothing! He's mine to finish!

1362
02:09:18,926 --> 02:09:20,621
He's mine!

1363
02:09:53,694 --> 02:09:57,687
Harry, when the connection is broken,
you must get to the Portkey.

1364
02:09:57,864 --> 02:09:59,923
We can linger for a moment
to give you some time...

1365
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:01,863
...but only a moment.
Do you understand?

1366
02:10:03,070 --> 02:10:06,096
Harry, take my body back, will you?

1367
02:10:06,273 --> 02:10:08,798
Take my body back to my father.

1368
02:10:09,843 --> 02:10:11,174
Let go.

1369
02:10:11,645 --> 02:10:13,613
Sweetheart, you're ready.

1370
02:10:14,448 --> 02:10:17,076
Let go! Let go!

1371
02:10:22,823 --> 02:10:24,188
Accio!

1372
02:10:29,896 --> 02:10:31,887
No!

1373
02:10:44,645 --> 02:10:46,237
He did it!

1374
02:10:47,481 --> 02:10:49,142
Harry!

1375
02:10:51,918 --> 02:10:53,408
Harry!

1376
02:10:54,621 --> 02:10:57,852
No! No! No, don't!

1377
02:10:58,158 --> 02:11:00,023
For God's sake, Dumbledore,
what's happened?

1378
02:11:00,327 --> 02:11:02,887
He's back. He's back.

1379
02:11:03,063 --> 02:11:05,088
Voldemort's back.

1380
02:11:05,265 --> 02:11:07,665
Cedric, he asked me
to bring his body back.

1381
02:11:07,834 --> 02:11:10,166
I couldn't leave him, not there.

1382
02:11:10,337 --> 02:11:13,135
It's all right, Harry. It's all right.

1383
02:11:13,307 --> 02:11:15,605
He's home. You both are.

1384
02:11:15,776 --> 02:11:19,405
Keep everybody in their seats.
A boy has just been killed.

1385
02:11:22,482 --> 02:11:26,145
The body must be moved, Dumbledore.
There are too many people.

1386
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:28,115
Let me through.

1387
02:11:28,288 --> 02:11:29,812
Let me through!

1388
02:11:31,725 --> 02:11:32,987
Let me through!

1389
02:11:33,160 --> 02:11:34,559
That's my son!

1390
02:11:35,862 --> 02:11:37,295
That's my boy!

1391
02:11:40,133 --> 02:11:42,863
It's my boy!

1392
02:11:45,672 --> 02:11:49,233
- Come on. Get up. Easy, easy!
- No.

1393
02:11:49,409 --> 02:11:52,378
This is not where you want to be
right now. Come on.

1394
02:11:53,046 --> 02:11:55,241
No!

1395
02:11:58,318 --> 02:12:00,718
It's all right, I got you.

1396
02:12:00,887 --> 02:12:04,220
I got you. Come on. Easy, now.

1397
02:12:08,228 --> 02:12:10,025
No!

1398
02:12:11,131 --> 02:12:12,996
No!

1399
02:12:55,409 --> 02:12:57,104
Are you all right, Potter?

1400
02:12:57,677 --> 02:12:59,611
Does it hurt? That?

1401
02:12:59,780 --> 02:13:01,577
Not so much now.

1402
02:13:02,516 --> 02:13:04,609
Perhaps I'd better take a look at it.

1403
02:13:07,754 --> 02:13:09,745
The cup was a Portkey.

1404
02:13:12,459 --> 02:13:14,290
Someone had bewitched it.

1405
02:13:14,561 --> 02:13:16,654
What was it like?

1406
02:13:16,997 --> 02:13:18,658
- What was he like?
- Who?

1407
02:13:18,832 --> 02:13:20,595
The Dark Lord.

1408
02:13:22,903 --> 02:13:25,997
What was it like
to stand in his presence?

1409
02:13:27,274 --> 02:13:29,071
I don't know.

1410
02:13:31,912 --> 02:13:34,847
It was like I'd fallen
into one of my dreams...

1411
02:13:37,818 --> 02:13:39,809
...into one of my nightmares.

1412
02:13:58,538 --> 02:14:00,096
Were there others?

1413
02:14:00,273 --> 02:14:02,537
In the graveyard, were there others?

1414
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:07,879
I...

1415
02:14:08,582 --> 02:14:12,518
I don't think I said anything
about a graveyard, professor.

1416
02:14:19,960 --> 02:14:23,225
"Marvelous creatures, dragons,
aren't they?"

1417
02:14:27,634 --> 02:14:30,694
Did you think that miserable oaf
would've led you into the woods...

1418
02:14:30,871 --> 02:14:32,771
...if I hadn't suggested it?

1419
02:14:36,309 --> 02:14:40,006
Do you think Cedric Diggory would've
told you to open the egg underwater...

1420
02:14:40,180 --> 02:14:42,671
...if I hadn't told him first myself?

1421
02:14:44,284 --> 02:14:46,946
Did you think Neville Longbottom,
the witless wonder...

1422
02:14:47,120 --> 02:14:50,317
...could've provided you with gillyweed
if I hadn't given him the book...

1423
02:14:50,490 --> 02:14:52,048
...that led him straight to it?

1424
02:15:00,467 --> 02:15:04,460
It was you from the beginning.
You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.

1425
02:15:05,038 --> 02:15:08,667
- You bewitched Krum, but you...
- "But... But..."

1426
02:15:08,842 --> 02:15:11,003
You won because I made it so, Potter.

1427
02:15:11,645 --> 02:15:15,137
You ended up in that graveyard tonight
because it was meant to be so.

1428
02:15:15,315 --> 02:15:16,612
And now the deed is done.

1429
02:15:18,285 --> 02:15:22,619
The blood that runs through these veins
runs within the Dark Lord.

1430
02:15:31,131 --> 02:15:34,623
Imagine how he will reward me
when he learns...

1431
02:15:35,569 --> 02:15:38,060
...that I have once and for all...

1432
02:15:38,672 --> 02:15:43,006
...silenced the great Harry Potter.

1433
02:15:43,176 --> 02:15:44,438
Expelliarmus!

1434
02:15:49,149 --> 02:15:50,411
Severus.

1435
02:15:52,886 --> 02:15:54,376
That's it, take it.

1436
02:15:56,356 --> 02:15:59,814
- Do you know who I am?
- Albus Dumbledore.

1437
02:15:59,993 --> 02:16:02,689
- Are you Alastor Moody? Are you?
- No.

1438
02:16:02,862 --> 02:16:05,956
Is he in this room? Is he in this room?

1439
02:16:09,002 --> 02:16:10,526
Harry, away from there!

1440
02:16:31,524 --> 02:16:34,857
- You all right, Alastor?
- I'm sorry, Albus.

1441
02:16:35,829 --> 02:16:37,888
That's Moody. But then who's...?

1442
02:16:39,699 --> 02:16:40,791
Polyjuice Potion.

1443
02:16:40,967 --> 02:16:44,198
Now we know who's been stealing
from your stores, Severus.

1444
02:16:44,437 --> 02:16:46,371
We'll get you up in a minute.

1445
02:17:20,807 --> 02:17:22,206
Harry!

1446
02:17:25,879 --> 02:17:28,074
Barty Crouch Junior.

1447
02:17:28,314 --> 02:17:31,249
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

1448
02:17:33,620 --> 02:17:34,814
Your arm, Harry.

1449
02:17:39,192 --> 02:17:41,422
You know what this means, don't you?

1450
02:17:42,328 --> 02:17:43,659
He's back.

1451
02:17:44,864 --> 02:17:46,991
Lord Voldemort has returned.

1452
02:17:47,934 --> 02:17:50,266
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it.

1453
02:17:50,470 --> 02:17:54,998
Send an owl to Azkaban. I think
they'll find they're missing a prisoner.

1454
02:17:55,475 --> 02:17:57,966
- I'll be welcomed back like a hero.
- Perhaps.

1455
02:17:58,545 --> 02:18:01,412
Personally, I've never had much time
for heroes.

1456
02:18:21,301 --> 02:18:23,963
Today, we acknowledge...

1457
02:18:24,671 --> 02:18:27,435
...a really terrible loss.

1458
02:18:29,542 --> 02:18:32,306
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know...

1459
02:18:32,479 --> 02:18:34,811
...exceptionally hard-working...

1460
02:18:35,715 --> 02:18:38,081
...infinitely fair-minded...

1461
02:18:38,651 --> 02:18:40,949
...and, most importantly...

1462
02:18:41,254 --> 02:18:45,816
...a fierce, fierce friend.

1463
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:51,329
Now, I think, therefore, you have
the right to know exactly how he died.

1464
02:18:54,367 --> 02:18:55,891
You see...

1465
02:18:56,736 --> 02:18:58,829
...Cedric Diggory was murdered...

1466
02:18:59,739 --> 02:19:01,730
...by Lord Voldemort!

1467
02:19:03,643 --> 02:19:07,204
The Ministry of Magic
does not wish me to tell you this.

1468
02:19:07,847 --> 02:19:11,544
But not to do so, I think,
would be an insult to his memory.

1469
02:19:13,720 --> 02:19:15,381
Now, the pain...

1470
02:19:15,555 --> 02:19:19,218
...we all feel at this dreadful loss
reminds me...

1471
02:19:19,392 --> 02:19:20,723
...and reminds us...

1472
02:19:20,894 --> 02:19:24,591
...that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues...

1473
02:19:24,764 --> 02:19:28,200
...our hearts beat as one.

1474
02:19:28,701 --> 02:19:30,726
In light of recent events...

1475
02:19:31,070 --> 02:19:36,007
...the bonds of friendship we've made
this year will be more important than ever.

1476
02:19:36,876 --> 02:19:42,212
Remember that, and Cedric Diggory
will not have died in vain.

1477
02:19:42,649 --> 02:19:44,776
You remember that...

1478
02:19:45,385 --> 02:19:48,411
...and we'll celebrate a boy who was...

1479
02:19:48,955 --> 02:19:51,423
...kind and honest...

1480
02:19:51,925 --> 02:19:56,521
...and brave and true,
right to the very end.

1481
02:20:21,754 --> 02:20:23,779
I never liked these curtains.

1482
02:20:24,390 --> 02:20:27,052
Set them on fire in my fourth year.

1483
02:20:27,393 --> 02:20:29,224
By accident, of course.

1484
02:20:34,901 --> 02:20:39,270
I put you in terrible danger
this year, Harry. I'm sorry.

1485
02:20:42,675 --> 02:20:44,370
Professor...

1486
02:20:44,577 --> 02:20:47,569
...when I was in the graveyard,
there was a moment...

1487
02:20:48,381 --> 02:20:52,784
...when Voldemort's wand and mine
sort of connected.

1488
02:20:54,354 --> 02:20:56,686
Priori Incantatem.

1489
02:21:00,827 --> 02:21:03,557
You saw your parents that night,
didn't you?

1490
02:21:04,130 --> 02:21:05,961
They reappeared.

1491
02:21:07,433 --> 02:21:11,199
No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry.
I trust you know that.

1492
02:21:13,773 --> 02:21:16,367
Dark and difficult times lie ahead.

1493
02:21:16,843 --> 02:21:21,678
Soon we must all face the choice
between what is right and what is easy.

1494
02:21:25,051 --> 02:21:26,712
But remember this:

1495
02:21:26,886 --> 02:21:28,820
You have friends here.

1496
02:21:30,823 --> 02:21:32,586
You're not alone.

1497
02:21:53,279 --> 02:21:55,008
Hermione.

1498
02:21:55,415 --> 02:21:57,406
This is for you.

1499
02:21:58,017 --> 02:22:00,212
Write to me. Promise.

1500
02:22:01,321 --> 02:22:02,720
Bye.

1501
02:22:08,962 --> 02:22:10,896
Au revoir, Ron.

1502
02:22:54,841 --> 02:22:57,366
Do you think we'll ever just have
a quiet year at Hogwarts?

1503
02:22:57,543 --> 02:22:58,669
- No.
- No.

1504
02:22:58,845 --> 02:23:03,214
No, I didn't think so. Oh, well.
What's life without a few dragons?

1505
02:23:07,620 --> 02:23:10,453
Everything's going to change now,
isn't it?

1506
02:23:17,764 --> 02:23:19,231
Yes.

1507
02:23:23,970 --> 02:23:27,269
Promise you'll write this summer.
Both of you.

1508
02:23:27,440 --> 02:23:30,000
I won't. You know I won't.

1509
02:23:31,277 --> 02:23:35,043
- Harry will, won't you?
- Yeah. Every week.
