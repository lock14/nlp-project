1
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,036
Dear David Bowie...

2
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,791
Well, it's Monday morning, which,
Iet's face it, in Cincinnati, is redundant.

3
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,073
I'm getting ready for school,
or, as I like to call it,

4
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,430
Guantánamo with a lunch period.

5
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,915
My mom says
that's seeing the glass half-empty.

6
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,032
Personally, I just hope one day
to actually see the glass.

7
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,230
Will, you're going to be late.

8
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,395
Will?

9
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,634
Are you writing another letter
to David Bowie?

10
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,549
Doesn't it bother you
that he never writes back?

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,038
-He knows that would only intimidate me.
-See, why can't I process rejection like that?

12
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,153
Good. Let's go.

13
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,112
So, what does the white whale
symbolize here?

14
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,595
School isn't gut-wrenchingly awful.

15
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,031
Mostly, it's just kind of like novocaine
for the soul.

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,956
I tend to make snap judgments
about people

17
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,517
based on what kind of music they like.
Like these kids are into hip-hop lite,

18
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,428
the kind where some rapper does one verse
of a Christina Aguilera song.

19
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,278
Then there's the "Trustafarians."

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,837
Rich suburban white kids with knit caps
and $2,000 dreadlock extensions.

21
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,555
The indie-rock clique is made up of me
and one other kid I refuse to meet

22
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,229
until he bathes
and stops flattening his hair with his hand.

23
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,828
What can I say?

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,158
I think I just kind of missed the memo
about how to fit in in Cincinnati.

25
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,590
I'm sorry. That was an accident.

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,919
- Dewey.
- Dewey!

27
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,189
Dewey!

28
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,993
Oh. well. As a wise musician once said.

29
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,954
"l have become comfortably numb."

30
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,717
Well, that's all for now.

31
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,669
Your number-one fan, Will Burton.

32
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,519
What's the one thing I could say right now
to make this better?

33
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,200
You quit your job
and we're moving out of Cincinnati?

34
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,675
I quit my job
and we're moving out of Cincinnati.

35
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,679
-You're a cat and I'm just your play toy.
-No, no, I mean it, I mean it.

36
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,836
-Aunt Nan gave me a job.
-ln Jersey?

37
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,554
Yeah! Yeah, and it's more money,
and flexible hours...

38
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,069
-Seriously?
-Yeah! And it's perfect.

39
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,839
The schools in Jersey
start second semester later.

40
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,949
Mom!

41
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,390
What? What is it?

42
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,875
I mean, it's not going
to be any different there.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,833
Okay, there's the Will Burton
I know and love.

44
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,111
God, for a moment,
you were actually possessed

45
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,629
by a happy, well-adjusted teenager.

46
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,750
-lt might be different. Different kids.
-Yeah, but same me.

47
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,312
Hey, hey. You are not the problem.
You are terrific.

48
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,875
Will.

49
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,472
Listen, honey, if you miss out on life,
they win.

50
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,193
- lf you just put your hand in mine
- lf you just put your hand in mine

51
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,798
-We're gonna leave all our troubles behind...
-We're gonna leave all our troubles behind...

52
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,718
-We'll walk and don't look back...
-We'll walk and don't look back...

53
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,115
-Don't look back...
-Don't look back...

54
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,549
Okay, Mick Jagger recorded this
with Peter Tosh.

55
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,353
It's almost ska.
It's like reggae, but it pops more,

56
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,277
and they don't sing about Jah.

57
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,196
You have no idea
what I'm talking about, do you?

58
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,230
No.

59
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,589
But it's nice to see you so happy!

60
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,595
Lodi!

61
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,592
Will, honey, it's a big day tomorrow.
Get to bed.

62
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,035
Well?

63
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,798
Elvis is entering the building.

64
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,036
-Unharmed?
-Completely.

65
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,671
All right!
See. I told you it would be different here.

66
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,795
Night and day.

67
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,872
Dear David Bowie.

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,073
there's one big advantage to
my new school over my old one: anonymity.

69
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,917
All those years of wishing I could
make myself invisible?

70
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,077
Turns out. all I had to do
was move to New Jersey.

71
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,748
Happy New Year, Van Buren! What's up?

72
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,197
I just have one question for you.

73
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,073
What's gonna happen
3,600 hours from right now?

74
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,838
-Bandslam!
-Bandslam!

75
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,635
And who's gonna bring home the gold?

76
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,715
-Glory Dogs!
-Glory Dogs!

77
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,071
Give it up for Ben Wheatly
and the Glory Dogs!

78
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,149
Lunch today was like
a Nuremberg rally produced by MTV.

79
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,759
Yes, you're number one!

80
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,235
Out of nowhere.
people were acting like maniacs

81
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,191
over something called Bandslam.

82
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,598
- I love you, Ben!
- What's up, Van Buren?

83
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,988
All right.

84
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,752
As we all know, Iast year at Bandslam.

85
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,268
the Glory Dogs tied for second
with the Burning Hotels.

86
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,752
Well, that's not happening this year.
You know why?

87
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,029
Why?

88
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,799
'Cause there's some new dogs
in the pound.

89
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,036
First up, all the way from Montclair.

90
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,835
Iiving with his dad, who he hates.
just to play with the Dogs:

91
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,192
Dylan Dyer!

92
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,395
Exactly how big is
this whole Bandslam thing around here?

93
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,715
Texas high-school-football big.

94
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,752
-You're new.
-Yeah.

95
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,550
Let me see your class schedule.

96
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,635
We have Human Studies together.

97
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,918
What's your name?

98
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,034
Will Burton. What's yours?

99
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,909
Last, but certainly not least.
everybody loves a drummer.

100
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,757
We got a bad boy on the kit.
and his name is Boe!

101
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,636
The "5" is silent.

102
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,119
Kit is crazy.

103
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,959
Incredible.

104
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,435
-What are you doing?
-Let me have a...

105
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,198
What are you doing?

106
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,432
Dear David Bowie.

107
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,632
today in my Human Studies class.
our teacher. Miss Wittenberg.

108
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,230
said the two words I dread more
than any others in the English language.

109
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,549
Buddy up.

110
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,993
This semester,
I want you to pick someone in the class

111
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,638
and create a presentation
that will show us who that person truly is.

112
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,752
Now, you can use photography,
poetry, video. Get creative, people.

113
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,395
You'll have to get together after school.

114
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,796
We're gonna know each other
in ways we never expected.

115
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,118
Do you want to start?

116
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,038
What's your favorite color?

117
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,151
Come on. I mean,
we have to dig a little deeper than that.

118
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,919
This project counts for, like, half our grade.

119
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,754
Look, why don't we take each other
to, like, our most favorite spot

120
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,189
and our least favorite spot
in the whole world?

121
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,355
Okay.

122
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,233
Least favorite?

123
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,749
Done.

124
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,589
Done.

125
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,559
Most favorite?

126
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,035
-Can I get back to you on that?
-Why do you talk like that?

127
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,112
- Like what?
- Like that.

128
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,351
Why do you look like that?

129
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,677
-I just do.
-Same here.

130
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,438
I used to stutter.

131
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,992
Emotion is overrated.

132
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,470
There may be a middle ground.

133
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,869
Idiots.

134
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,275
Morons.

135
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,748
Open. Right now.
Right now, right now, right now.

136
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,838
-I'm sorry. Are you okay?
-Do not come near me!

137
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,030
Are you all right?

138
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,709
If anything happened to my cello,
I'm going to sue his parents.

139
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,795
Seems all right.

140
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,993
It's impossible to tell until you play it.
It's not like it's a viola.

141
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,199
Hey! Hey, Good Samaritan,
do you like kids?

142
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,590
-What?
-Do you like kids? It's a simple question.

143
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,073
Of course you do.
All Good Samaritans like kids.

144
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,919
It's in the handbook.
Come on, we don't have a lot of time.

145
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,075
What?

146
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,472
-What is this?
-This is a daycare program

147
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,831
our fair school set up
with Lindsay Elementary around the corner.

148
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,840
-Beef jerky! Beef Jerky!
-Beef jerky! Beef Jerky!

149
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,111
Beef jerky. Teriyaki flavor.
They... They love it.

150
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,309
- Beef Jerky!
- Beef Jerky!

151
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,873
Okay, ready?

152
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,955
You.

153
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,349
Who's...

154
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,830
Oh, uh...

155
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,428
That's Mr. Berry. He "supervises."

156
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,472
All right, everybody, sit down.
Come on, monsters.

157
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,794
-Name?
-Will. Will Burton.

158
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,759
Charlotte Barnes.

159
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,668
Ladies and gentlemen,
Will Burton is in the house!

160
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,512
Can I have your iPod?

161
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,312
Hey, Rory,
you want to listen to some of Will's music?

162
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,000
Is it like your band? Glory Dogs rock.

163
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,399
Ex-band, Rory.

164
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,432
-They're not gonna want to listen to that.
-Halt.

165
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,955
Way to soothe the savage beast.

166
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,633
You are a weirdo, aren't you, Will Burton?

167
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,435
She wants you to do this every week?

168
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,672
You know, just 'cause someone
tells you to do something

169
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,791
doesn't mean you have to do it.

170
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,875
Why is she still here?

171
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,389
I thought you trained these dogs
at Aunt Nan's kennel.

172
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,149
She's getting placed tomorrow,
with a lady who has tummy issues.

173
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,555
Yeah. Right, Mazzy? Mazzy, Maalox.

174
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,433
So, now, since when are you so interested
in daycare?

175
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,028
Since when do you talk to the dogs
like that?

176
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,152
Since when did you get so good
at changing the subject?

177
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,509
-That's appetizing.
-Yeah, and it's not Maalox. Mazzy, Maalox.

178
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,070
So, what's this Charlotte like?

179
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,511
Not only is she the coolest person
who's ever spoken to me,

180
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,030
she's potentially the coolest person
on the whole planet.

181
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,352
But please,
don't make a big deal about it, okay?

182
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,115
-ls she pretty?
-Mom!

183
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,231
We are not going to sit here,
do each other's nails

184
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,397
and gossip about crushes, okay?
Not gonna happen.

185
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,510
Tylenol is not Maalox.
Well, it's not a bad idea. High five!

186
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,472
You walk home from school?

187
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,558
School bus waits for no one.
Not even art class.

188
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,880
Hey, want to see the coolest place ever?

189
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,398
-My dad used to bring me here.
-ls he dead?

190
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,993
No. Take it back.

191
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,795
I take it back. Sorry.
Just the way you were talking about him.

192
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,279
No, I'm sorry.

193
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,713
It's just last summer he got sick,

194
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,719
and I don't like putting stuff like that
into the universe, you know?

195
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,592
Can I ask a question?

196
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,559
You're a senior.

197
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,074
-Was that the end of the question?
-Why are you hanging out with me?

198
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,873
I don't do whys.
Okay. The Velvet Underground.

199
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,548
If I'm going to teach you the basics,
we might as well start with the best.

200
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,113
Well, actually,
if we're gonna start with the Velvets,

201
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,028
I'd rather listen to the 1969 self-titled
The Velvet Underground.

202
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,195
Unless you think the band went downhill
when Lou Reed fired John Cale.

203
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,119
Who are you?

204
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,595
Will.

205
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,476
Do you know a lot about music?

206
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,795
Yeah.

207
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,875
-Why hasn't this come up before?
-We didn't really have a before.

208
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,228
Good point.

209
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,917
-My dad's a musician.
-No way. Have I heard of him?

210
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,989
No, he's what they call a sideman.

211
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,631
If The Who need a keyboard
during their tour,

212
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,274
or Sonic Youth wants a synth part
on a track...

213
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,868
Wait, he tours with The Who?

214
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,038
I know it sounds cool, but I mean,
it just means he's never around.

215
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,750
That's why my mom divorced him.

216
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,997
So, what's the deal with the whole
Bandslam thing? It's like a town obsession.

217
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,159
Yeah. That's because the winner
gets an actual bona fide record deal.

218
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,630
- Seriously?
- Yep. Seriously.

219
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,873
Do any other bands from the school enter?

220
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,913
Going up against Glory Dogs
would be like burning the American flag.

221
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,392
-Then why'd you quit?
-I told you, I don't do whys.

222
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,716
Besides, I'm thinking
of starting another band.

223
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,751
Hey, come hear us jam on Saturday.

224
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,952
Give us the benefit
of your vast musical knowledge.

225
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,798
-I don't really do well in groups.
-Always do the thing that scares you.

226
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,949
Hello. London!

227
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,990
I want you to want me

228
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,870
I need you to need me

229
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,716
I'd love you to love me. yeah

230
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,996
And I'm begging you to beg me

231
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,993
Shine up the old brown shoes
Put on a brand-new shirt

232
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:23,592
Get home early from work
lf you say that you love me

233
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,318
Didn't l, didn't l, didn't I see you crying?

234
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,835
Didn't l, didn't l, didn't I see you crying?

235
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,158
-Who's this?
-Oh!

236
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,677
Hey! This would be the coolest kid ever.

237
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,520
Knows absolutely everything about music.

238
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,316
Guys, this is Will. Will, this is guys.

239
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,909
-What's up?
-So, what do you think?

240
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,038
I mean, it's pretty tasty, huh?

241
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,357
Did you catch how, like, my bass line,
it shadowed his lead guitar?

242
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,233
I mean, it was almost like I was a bodyguard
for his riff, dude. He was like...

243
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,039
And I was like... And he was like...
And I was like... And he was like...

244
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,472
Dear David Bowie, how do you tell
Pinocchio he'll never be a real boy?

245
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,119
Okay, okay!

246
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,035
Okay!

247
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,230
Look, I know you're going for this kind of

248
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,669
Thin Lizzy, dual guitar,
third-above harmony.

249
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,916
-Right.
-But, I mean, it's tough, sonically,

250
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,952
to pull off, because you can't
get the bass sound fat enough,

251
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,231
or even in the same octave
to create any real presence.

252
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,154
Especially if your instruments
aren't exactly tuned to each other.

253
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,711
- I bloody well told you!
- Did you? When?

254
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,718
Bug, you stupid git, I don't need any
more of your bloody nonsense.

255
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,717
I don't need any
of your bloody Englishisms.

256
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,149
You're not English, Omar, you are
from Newark. Get that hand out of my...

257
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,669
Hey, wait, wait, whoa, whoa. Can it.

258
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,993
Look, we were afraid of sounding too slick.

259
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,473
No, you're safe.

260
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,075
What else?

261
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,918
I mean,
they don't really want to hear what l...

262
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,950
No, what else?

263
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,514
I can't stress how badly
you need an actual drummer.

264
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,517
Well, what about me, then?

265
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,552
No offense, but it seems
like you're trying way too hard

266
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,353
to be Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

267
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,194
I am not.

268
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,915
Okay. It's just with all the jumping around
and the shorts...

269
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,554
Come on, man. I don't want to be Flea.
I don't even like Flea.

270
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,750
-Yeah, what's your name?
-Bug.

271
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,717
-I mean, what's the band called, anyway?
-Glory Dogs.

272
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,831
Isn't that the name of the other band?

273
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,758
No. They're Ben Wheatly
and the Glory Dogs.

274
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,155
Like Bruce Springsteen
and the E Street Band,

275
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,158
or Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.
You get it?

276
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,274
That way, he can fire whoever he wants to
whenever he wants to,

277
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,152
and it stays his band.

278
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,358
Look, are we through here,
because I'm starving.

279
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,836
Yes. Come on.
So, Will, every Saturday at noon, right here.

280
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,836
And don't be late.

281
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,235
So, Omar, where exactly in England
is New Jersey?

282
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,679
Bug, leave it out.

283
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,314
Miles Feltenstien is a puzzle.

284
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,508
An enigma.

285
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,714
A sphinx.

286
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,190
- So, I guess we should get together again.
- Okay, sure. What about your house?

287
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,877
Can you have friends over?

288
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,549
Friends. Don't have those.

289
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,788
Me neither.

290
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,959
Maybe we could not have friends together.

291
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,431
Actually, I might have one friend.
You know Charlotte Barnes?

292
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,235
-Since I was 1 0. She's a senior.
-Yeah, I thought that was weird, too.

293
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,874
So there's a 50% chance
that I might be the punch line

294
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,275
to some elaborate practical joke,

295
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,717
but she seems pretty sincere.
Are you friends?

296
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,151
Ever hear a stutterer laugh?

297
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,595
Ha.

298
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,430
Ha.

299
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,677
-Be careful, Will.
-Why?

300
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,197
Leopards and cheerleaders
don't change their spots.

301
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,677
She's a cheerleader?

302
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,076
Was. Last year. Junior prom queen, too.

303
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,353
That's amazing to me.
I mean, she seems so...

304
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,309
Not.

305
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,115
She's got her own Wikipedia page.

306
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,357
You're head cheerleader?
I read your Wikipedia page.

307
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,118
Was. That was last year. Another life.

308
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,393
Hey, I notice you never say anything
about my vocals.

309
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,511
Afraid I'll stop being your friend
if you rip me a new one?

310
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,154
What? No. You're amazing.

311
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,710
-Don't get infatuated with me.
-I'm not getting infatuated with you!

312
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,389
Please, Louise!
You'd eat my laundry for a month if I asked.

313
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,189
But I'm never going to ask you, Will.

314
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,278
This has just become
my new least favorite memory.

315
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,432
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we get it.

316
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,913
Hey, Charlotte.

317
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,238
- What's up, guys?
- Hey.

318
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,271
What's going on? Omar.

319
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,472
Hey, you got a little something
on your upper lip there.

320
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,158
Don't talk to him.

321
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,390
Why? All right, what did I do?

322
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,837
Do you have a head injury?

323
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,473
I did not screw them over.

324
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,592
I have a chance to play with my heroes,
you know?

325
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,078
Dylan Dyer is an artist, right, Omar?
You said so yourself.

326
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,431
-He's all right.
-"He's all right"? The guy's a monster!

327
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,632
-Well, what about loyalty?
-No one's saying you aren't good,

328
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,513
'cause you guys are good.
You guys are really good.

329
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,198
We just have to be great, you know?

330
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,153
And sometimes you just have to realize
when it's time to step aside.

331
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,113
- Like right now. I have tables.
- Why are you being like this?

332
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,391
You quit before any of this
even happened with them.

333
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,197
All right, can we just please
go somewhere and talk?

334
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,995
-I'm working.
-Okay, then tomorrow, after last period.

335
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,156
-I'm hanging out with Will.
-Who the heck is Will?

336
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,352
That the heck is Will.
Say hello, the heck is Will.

337
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,910
Hi.

338
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,073
You gotta be kidding me.

339
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,239
Will happens to be my friend
and the manager of my new band.

340
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,873
-Whoa! Hey.
-What?

341
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,879
-Your band? You guys are a band now?
-Yeah.

342
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,470
- And he's your manager?
- Yeah.

343
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,070
-This is crazy!
-Holla.

344
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,633
It gets worse.

345
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,911
This year, Van Buren's
sending two bands to Bandslam.

346
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,389
What? What? No.

347
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,919
You guys are going up against Glory Dogs?

348
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,871
We are Glory Dogs!

349
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,032
You have changed, Charlotte.
Everybody says so.

350
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,638
Everybody's right.

351
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,838
My cell phone died.

352
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,556
-So, what happened?
-I got caught up.

353
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,829
All day?

354
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,519
With Charlotte.

355
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,272
I'm managing her band.

356
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,273
You're what?
I thought you were doing daycare.

357
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,915
-She's very demanding.
-Well, shouldn't we talk about this?

358
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,955
No. I think we should trust me.

359
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,029
Well, I do trust you.

360
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,596
It's just that five minutes ago
you were afraid to get on a school bus,

361
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,676
and now you're managing a band.

362
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,394
It's all just moving a little fast,
don't you think?

363
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,397
I made some friends, Mom.

364
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,792
I know.
It's uncharted territory for both of us.

365
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,994
Twizzler?

366
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,633
Food of the gods.

367
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,194
It's ska.

368
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,748
I like it.

369
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,510
-It's like reggae, but they made it their own.
-Exactly.

370
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,678
There you are. Hey.

371
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,155
Wait. Don't tell me you're the world-famous
Sa5m-the-5-is-silent.

372
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,475
For that alone, you are my hero.

373
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,399
-I'm Charlotte. Nice to meet you.
-I've known you since fifth grade.

374
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,912
You used to babysit me.

375
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,835
Huh.

376
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,038
Come on. Time for the ankle-biters.
They'll eat their own if we're late.

377
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,755
-Are we still gonna meet up after school?
-Yeah, it's a date.

378
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:57,071
Not like a "date" date. You know,
we're just working on a project for class.

379
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,634
-It's not like we're dating.
-She gets it, Will.

380
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,318
Okay. See you.

381
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,758
Nice seeing you again, Sa5m-the-5-is-silent.

382
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,595
Genius.

383
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,953
Dear David Bowie.

384
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,550
despite my usual worries and fears
and complaints.

385
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,077
Van Buren does not actually
completely suck.

386
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,551
As for the band.
they finally agreed to add a drummer.

387
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,830
but only if it's Basher Martin.

388
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,750
Apparently, he's the best drummer
in school.

389
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,156
but all he takes are auto shop
and anger management classes.

390
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,233
Which he failed.

391
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,949
Twice.

392
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,796
I just have to be cool.
I just have to walk right up to him and say...

393
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,989
Drums.

394
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,279
What about them?

395
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,709
Look. You can either say
what's on your mind,

396
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,876
or take your little afro
and go ahead and scurry back...

397
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,149
You play.

398
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,798
Wow, this is hard.

399
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,432
I'm Will. I manage this awesome band.

400
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,236
We need a drummer for Bandslam.

401
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,270
Hey, look, I'm sorry.

402
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,597
You know, I need things in my life
that keep me calm.

403
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,918
You know,
I hate the whole Bandslam thing.

404
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,554
It's just a bunch of lemmings
chasing after a record deal,

405
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,069
but they don't care about their art.

406
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,757
You know, I care about art.

407
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,190
And if you do too,
then how can this be enough for you?

408
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,356
I mean, you're a musician,

409
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,673
and here you are going through life,
passing people every day,

410
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,713
and no one knows that inside,
you're this golden god.

411
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,874
Don't you feel like Clark Kent?

412
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,075
I do kind of feel like Clark Kent.

413
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,795
Look, I'll tell you what.
Have them make a rehearsal demo.

414
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,798
I'll check it out, see how they sound.

415
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,992
No. That would be like licking the pages
of a cookbook.

416
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,397
You have to actually go hear them.
Play with them.

417
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,033
Make them great.

418
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,233
Who's the babe?

419
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,353
I dig older chicks 'cause they're
the only ones who really get me.

420
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,754
That's my...

421
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,993
Older sister.

422
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,876
Well, she actually hangs out with the band,
like, all the time.

423
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,353
All the time.

424
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,113
So, you know...

425
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,078
Didn't l, didn't l, didn't I see you crying?

426
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,109
Didn't l, didn't l, didn't I see you crying?

427
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,633
I can't believe I'm doing this.

428
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,877
I have a very slim shot at being popular
if this whole band thing works out.

429
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,752
You can help me do it.

430
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,838
He is 17 years old!

431
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,192
He likes older chicks.

432
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,955
I look ridiculous.

433
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,039
No, you look great. We'll run you
through a carwash on the way home.

434
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,118
-How old did you tell him I was?
-Twenty-three.

435
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,915
God!

436
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,157
Dude, that was sick.

437
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,750
Look, it was obviously better,
but we still need a fuller sound.

438
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,233
-What?
-I'm thinking we bring in

439
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,270
some more players, just for Bandslam.

440
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,119
That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard.
Get out of my house.

441
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,674
-We don't need any more players!
-Hey!

442
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,999
We have a guest.

443
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,074
Hi. Thanks.

444
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,394
And Will's right. We probably should
bring in some other players.

445
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,069
-You mean, like, use sidemen?
-Hold on, wait. Use what men?

446
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,952
Sidemen. Will's dad is a sideman.

447
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,072
Plays with lots of famous bands.
Is that what you meant, Will?

448
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,350
Will's dad is joining the band?

449
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:12,474
...these huge stadium crowds at that time.
and I'm thinking.

450
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,830
"What are these people doing here?
Why have they come to see me?

451
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,952
"They should be seeing Phil Collins.
They were definitely... "

452
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,958
I'm taking a shower.
I'm taking three showers.

453
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,115
Will, what's a sideman?

454
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,549
"...your mother and l,
we tried to protect you from all this.

455
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,069
"but... Well, if you must know.
your sister ran away. "

456
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,433
"Why did you kill Ziggy?"
It was hard for all of us...

457
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,676
Yo, his name is Chet
and you know he's crunk

458
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,711
He likes the girls that got the junk

459
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,035
He's a paperboy
And he's making them bills

460
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,310
He got these diamonds all up in his grills

461
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,192
He makes the grades from day to day

462
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,436
When he go to the club he don't gotta pay

463
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,836
Hey, we're almost the only ones left to go.
We should get together.

464
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,952
Soon, I promise, 'cause I really
have to work on the band now, you know?

465
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,479
They have to sound fuller.

466
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,956
They're living on Cheap Trick covers.
It's embarrassing.

467
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,036
You don't have to. You want to.

468
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,038
You haven't heard them.
Believe me, I have to.

469
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,634
You want to.

470
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,994
Dear David Bowie.

471
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,872
first thing we need is a brass section.

472
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,595
Though, granted. Van Buren
has a limited pool to choose from.

473
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,639
The pianists around here are all classical.

474
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,472
If Arcade Fire can have a cello.
we can have a cello.

475
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,034
- Need a hand?
-Need a Stanford-Binet test?

476
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,674
What? Sorry. It looked heavy.

477
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,113
I have eight weeks
to turn them into an actual band.

478
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,391
We need to take all this
psychotic energy and talent

479
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,351
and turn it into something new.

480
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,950
Okay, look, let's just start
by playing something simple.

481
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,310
You guys ever heard of blue beat?

482
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,630
Basher, get behind your drum kit.

483
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,715
Please?

484
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,350
All right, now, give me a Sly and Robbie
kind of groove, you know?

485
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,993
-Something 2 Tone.
-I don't do blue beat.

486
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,395
Everybody knows
you could beat that kit senseless,

487
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,875
but real power is in holding back.

488
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,038
Control, you know, finding a groove.
Come on.

489
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,273
Use some hi-hat.

490
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,277
Okay, you know what a reggae groove is.
Cross stick.

491
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,637
There we go. Kick drum.

492
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,755
Sweet. No wonder you are a legend.

493
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,155
All right, Bug, come on, come on.

494
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,868
All right, listen to what he's doing
and try and play against it.

495
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,638
Okay, that's good.

496
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,759
There we go.

497
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,919
That is what I'm talking about. That is what
you call a rhythm section. Everybody!

498
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,270
Come on. Just make up your part.

499
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,915
Don't worry about it being perfect, okay?

500
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,194
Just make it fit to what you're hearing.

501
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,073
And after the one,
let me hear some trombone.

502
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,589
Trumpet.

503
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,555
And sax.

504
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,673
Will Burton, you are amazing...

505
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,155
Mon.

506
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,632
You guys are gonna sound great.

507
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,194
But for Bandslam,
we need to find that one great song

508
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,993
-that says who we really are.
-So what exactly are you looking for?

509
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,838
I mean, I don't know,
but I will when I hear it.

510
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,915
What else?

511
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,270
All right, we have to talk
about the band name.

512
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,470
I mean, there can't be two Glory Dogs.
There just can't.

513
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,431
-Why? We are the Glory Dogs!
-We are the Glory Dogs. Yeah?

514
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,152
Honestly, the name just sucks.

515
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,989
It's lame and generic
and sounds like a Springsteen cover band.

516
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,114
Okay, well, what do you want to call us?

517
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,631
I Can't Go On, I'll Go On.

518
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,190
I Can't a What a What?

519
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,790
I Can't Go On, I'll Go On.
It's evocative. It's memorable.

520
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,036
It's ridiculous!
And it's not a name, all right?

521
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,798
- Don't say that!
- Glory Dogs, it says we're scruffy,

522
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,070
-you know? We bite.
-You know, it is a name.

523
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,714
Like Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly,

524
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,877
or Clap Your Hands Say Yeah,
which are both great bands.

525
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,594
This is where I draw the line.
I am not giving Ben Glory Dogs!

526
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,153
Get your ego out of it!

527
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,077
Will knows more about this stuff
in his little finger

528
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,758
than the rest of us put together.

529
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,758
You actually think we were better
before Will came along?

530
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,310
Yeah, we were a joke.
Now we have a shot at being a band.

531
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,068
Come on, to I Can't Go On, I'll Go On!

532
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,759
Fine. Fine.

533
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,871
- How was your day?
lnappropriate! Inappropriate!

534
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,157
-Honey, I was just...
-Taking a shower!

535
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,669
Years from now, some shrink will pick out
this moment in time...

536
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,677
Fine, fine, but hurry up.

537
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,833
You're pulling away from me. A little bit.

538
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,438
And I don't know how I feel about it.
I just... I have to say that out loud.

539
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,676
We are not having this discussion now.

540
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,109
Can we continue this after rehearsal?

541
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,355
Please?

542
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,833
On the seventh hour ofthe seventh day

543
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,950
The seventh son was looking
for a seventh-stage getaway

544
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,393
The word came down from a blinding light

545
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,675
You got one chance. baby
Baby. you better do it right

546
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,991
Well, I was driving down on the 101

547
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,599
And it was late at night and I was thinking
about the things I'd done

548
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,191
All of my regrets

549
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,711
And baby, all of my fears

550
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,709
Yeah, I was slipping the car.
From gear to gear to gear

551
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,239
Hey, hey, hey

552
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,158
God bless the child

553
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,718
God bless his soul

554
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,830
God perish the idea
that he'll die before he's old

555
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,678
You gotta be cool

556
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,476
You got to behave

557
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,192
Man. there'll be a time for that
when I'm lying in my grave

558
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:19,438
You gotta watch your step
or you'll lose your way

559
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,955
Take heed of the others
and do everything they say

560
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,718
Watch out for the man

561
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,836
Who never tolls the bells

562
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,519
'Cause if I fear for the devil
and I fear for myself

563
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,200
Then I'm gonna have to fear
for everybody else

564
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,669
I'm gonna fly

565
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,434
And I'm gonna live

566
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,833
Until the day I die

567
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,309
And I ain't got time

568
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,035
To wonder why

569
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,108
I'm gonna live

570
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,273
Till the day I die

571
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,473
We still have that stupid
Human Studies project to finish,

572
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,388
and we haven't hung out
since you've become Joe Cool Rock 'n' Roll.

573
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,192
You still haven't taken me
to your favorite place.

574
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,949
-'Cause I've never been there.
-How can it be your favorite place, then?

575
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,555
What?

576
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,430
Will.

577
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,233
What now? Huh?

578
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,590
Got you.

579
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,310
Oh, no.

580
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,078
-Check it out.
-Cool.

581
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,999
CBGB's.

582
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,117
The nerve center of everything that mattered
in music in the past 40 years,

583
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,838
and it closed
before I ever got to step inside.

584
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,116
Now they're turning it
into some cheesy clothing store.

585
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,756
It's better that way.
Now it can never disappoint you.

586
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,632
What are you doing?

587
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,315
Come on.

588
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,478
-Look at it.
-Yeah, it's a toilet.

589
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,038
Are you kidding me?

590
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,240
Birthplace of punk!

591
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,073
The Ramones.

592
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,590
Patti Smith.

593
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,550
Do you know how many times
she must've spit on this floor?

594
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,914
Bad Brains.

595
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,989
Without CBGB's,
there'd be no Sex Pistols or The Clash.

596
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,630
So U2 doesn't get inspired
to form a band in lreland.

597
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,753
And the Killers don't hear U2 in Vegas
and decide to pick up guitars.

598
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,430
The list is endless!

599
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,357
Wow. I'm starting to feel
like a Japanese tourist.

600
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,155
Then the rent got jacked, like, 2,000%.

601
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:55,876
So now CBGB's is just a T-shirt
Paris Hilton wears if she wants to look cool.

602
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,230
I knew it'd be my favorite place.

603
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,473
So, what's yours?

604
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,671
Now this is.

605
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,835
It's all right. You lived.

606
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,191
I think if you tried signaling,
people would honk less.

607
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:39,518
-They don't need to know my business.
-It's not really a privacy issue.

608
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,154
Pretty good rehearsal today,
don't you think?

609
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,475
So, what's up with you and Sa5m?

610
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,996
-You like her.
-She's my friend.

611
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,793
-No, you "like her" like her.
-Shut up.

612
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,672
-Have you kissed her yet?
-No.

613
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,915
Have you ever kissed any girl?

614
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,759
Remember how I said that "eating
your laundry for a month" conversation

615
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,190
was my least favorite memory?
We have a new champion.

616
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,996
You gotta go for her. Carpe diem.

617
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,509
You're crazy. She'd laugh at me.

618
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,313
Trust me, that girl is one kiss away
from doodling "Mrs. Will Burton"

619
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,192
all over her sneakers.

620
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,910
I wouldn't even know what to do.

621
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,074
Okay, I only do this for people with dazzling
artistic ability and whose initials are W. B.

622
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,908
Come here.

623
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,873
Don't have an aneurysm.
This is strictly educational.

624
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,788
Commit everything I do and say to memory.
How you handle this moment with Sa5m

625
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,196
will haunt you, good or bad,
for the rest of your life.

626
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,468
All right.

627
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,469
First, start by gently moving
a strand of hair from her face.

628
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,069
Go ahead.

629
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,072
Allows you to touch her
without freaking her out.

630
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,155
Nice.

631
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,512
Now that your hand is there,
turn it into a caress down her cheek.

632
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,835
Once you've made physical contact,
never cede your ground.

633
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,392
It's very important.

634
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,433
Now, lower your hand
to the back of her neck.

635
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,469
Then lean in. Slowly. Slowly.

636
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,589
Breathe.

637
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,396
Slight parting of the lips, and...

638
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,189
I bet you'll never forget that song
for the rest of your life.

639
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,599
Night, Will.

640
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,637
Good night, Charlotte.

641
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,951
I am so going to heaven.

642
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,559
Hello, Mother.

643
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,198
-Morning.
-Morning.

644
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,513
You busy after school?
Have you ever been to the Overlook?

645
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,998
What's the Overlook?

646
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,195
What?

647
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,115
Dear David Bowie.
I wouldn't tell anyone this but you.

648
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,395
Boy, you sure like to read, huh?

649
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:23,235
My shrink says it allows me
to control something in my life.

650
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,749
This was it.
the moment that would haunt me.

651
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,997
for better or worse.
for the entire rest of my life.

652
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,236
Start with a strand of hair.

653
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,118
She's wearing a hat!

654
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,036
-What are you doing?
-You...

655
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,432
What was next? Caress!

656
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:01,599
This was not a caress.
This was petting. I'm petting her.

657
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,760
Okay, enough. This was it.

658
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,791
Have you seen Evil Dead ll?

659
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:03,949
No.

660
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,196
It's my favorite movie ever.

661
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,273
You never get to see it in a theater,

662
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,153
but it's playing at the college
Saturday night.

663
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,397
They don't card anyone there.
Would you want to go?

664
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,075
Sure, I'd love to.

665
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:21,795
Cool.

666
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:29,114
All in all, I think it went pretty well.
Your number-one fan. Will Burton.

667
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:48,032
But it's fun, it's fun.
You know, I've been in a few bands, and...

668
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,835
Boy, you tied the heck
out of that shoe.

669
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,313
Considering it was already tied
and everything.

670
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,591
-Can't be too careful.
-You don't have an inhaler, do you?

671
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,836
'Cause if you do,
you might want to get it ready.

672
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,313
-No!
-Yeah.

673
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,919
You're getting a sneak peek
at the competition,

674
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,439
and I'm not talking Glory Dogs.

675
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,869
Burning Hotels?
But I didn't think there was any way that...

676
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,831
Where there's a will...

677
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,549
Dear David Bowie.
I know it's not saying much.

678
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,956
but this is the coolest thing
that ever happened to me.

679
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,516
I got in, you got out

680
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,394
I walked in, you walked out

681
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,512
As usual I'm stuck in the middle

682
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,275
I'm closer to closure

683
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,120
Admitting that it's over

684
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,198
As usual I'm stuck in the middle

685
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,276
And now you know

686
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,474
That you control everything

687
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,753
As usual I'm stuck in the middle

688
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,596
And now I'm drowning

689
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,596
Where's Will?

690
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,551
In myself again

691
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,912
Yes, I'm drowning

692
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,234
In myself again

693
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:37,393
White at night

694
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:42,038
I am dead

695
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:49,432
White at night

696
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:55,271
I am dead

697
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:59,034
Who knows how I got out?

698
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,390
Who knows how I got out?

699
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,035
As usual I'm stuck in the middle

700
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,596
I am such a jerk. But it was Burning Hotels!

701
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,395
I had to see the competition.
Don't I get a Burning Hotels pardon?

702
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,078
Tell me one thing.

703
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,996
-Were you with her?
-Yeah.

704
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,436
Are you in love with Charlotte?

705
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,595
What?

706
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,758
-You are.
-I'm not.

707
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,719
-I'm not.
-You had a thing. I don't care.

708
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:55,474
Look, just remember.
She's trouble. Girls like that always are.

709
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,637
That's ridiculous.
I'm not in love with Charlotte.

710
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:04,269
You still haven't washed your hand yet.
It was that special, being with her.

711
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,710
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

712
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,876
Sa5m should be home any minute.

713
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,275
What is this project
that you're working on about?

714
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,439
Each other. We're supposed to show
the class who the other person really is.

715
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,435
Yeah.

716
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,278
You sheltered me from harm

717
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,317
Kept me warm

718
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,632
Kept me warm

719
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,273
You gave my life to me

720
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,551
Set me free

721
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,150
Set me free

722
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,317
It was a competition. She didn't win.

723
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,037
Yeah. Judges were idiots.

724
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,035
Morons.

725
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,796
All the years I had with you

726
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:18,392
And I would give everything I own

727
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:24,314
I'd give up my life. my heart. my home

728
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:30,553
I would give everything I own

729
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,912
What are you doing?

730
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,840
-Here we go.
-What's wrong? That was amazing.

731
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,713
-I can't believe you showed that to him.
-Why not? What's the big deal?

732
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,478
Why are you here?

733
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,955
-I came to apologize again.
-Just go.

734
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,799
She'll forgive you.
I happen to be a girl. I know these things.

735
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,194
Yeah. Okay.

736
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:58,355
Hey, we got our first post.
"Lower your mortgage rates now."

737
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,119
Does spam count?

738
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,955
You weren't reading my lM, were you?

739
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,513
You mean the one from Phil
that said "love you"?

740
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,516
-Yeah.
-No.

741
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,675
Good.

742
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,674
He's my dad.

743
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,755
-And you call him Phil?
-That's his name.

744
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,750
Hi, I've been looking for you.

745
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,472
Well, you found me.

746
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:48,996
I went back up to Hunter Mountain again.
Got stuck on the exact same lift as last year.

747
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,998
- No way.
- Seriously.

748
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,592
It seems it's not as magical
when you're by yourself.

749
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,313
What'd you do?

750
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,750
Same thing I did last year.
I cried like a little girl.

751
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,912
Listen, Charlotte.

752
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:07,077
I was thinking that maybe it's time for you
to give me another chance.

753
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,315
Look...

754
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:17,470
-What's this?
-This is me risking complete humiliation.

755
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,718
Say, won't you stay

756
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,351
We can talk about nothing at all

757
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,993
You are so corny.

758
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,039
Or sit here and make up the words

759
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,437
As we go along

760
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,439
They told me maybe she's crazy

761
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,676
A little like you

762
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,669
Everyone said you were nothing but trouble

763
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:54,238
And all that I know
is that I've never been here before

764
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:58,628
I don't need to pretend anymore

765
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:08,154
Strange, so strange

766
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,429
You are hilarious.

767
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:12,757
When it feels better being alone

768
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:16,757
You'll accept there is nobody else

769
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,276
Then set it in stone

770
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,358
And they told me maybe she's crazy

771
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,118
A little like you

772
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,753
Everyone said...

773
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:37,876
Will and I were just updating our band's
MySpace page.

774
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,353
You know that kid, Will Burton?
Do some recon.

775
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:50,790
Find out everything you can about him.

776
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,037
They'll have his records in the office.
Where he's from, where he went to school.

777
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,993
His guidance counselor report,
that'll have all the good stuff. All right?

778
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,599
Everything. And do it today.

779
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,439
Whoa. Yo, dude,
we don't actually work for you.

780
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,836
It's not like you're the Joker
and we're your henchmen.

781
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,631
Fine. I'll do it myself.

782
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:13,989
All right, best for last. Sa5m, Will?
Tell us who you are.

783
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:26,079
My project is Will Burton.

784
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,512
I'm pointing
because it's hard to tell who he is.

785
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:35,471
I was going to use photographs
for this presentation,

786
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:41,073
but then I realized, the real Will Burton
can't be captured on film.

787
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,389
Instead,

788
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,433
you need this.

789
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:50,314
Will is a reflective surface.

790
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:54,078
He mirrors back at you
whatever you want to see.

791
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,471
He reflects you back to you.

792
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,516
And it's nice for awhile.

793
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,551
You stop feeling lonely.

794
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:09,031
But then you realize,
he's doing that with everyone.

795
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,754
The only person he can't do it for

796
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,349
is Will.

797
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,956
Because he doesn't have a clue

798
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,148
who he is.

799
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,915
Okay, well, that was very creative.

800
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,630
And really mean. Okay, Will, you're up.

801
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,831
Ifl told you things I did before

802
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,554
Told you how I used to be

803
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,233
Would you go along with someone like me?

804
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,235
If you knew my story word for word

805
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,920
Had all of my history

806
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:57,519
Would you go along with someone like me?

807
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,992
And we don't care about the young folks

808
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,553
Talking about the young style

809
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,558
And we don't care about the old folks

810
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:11,797
Talking about the old style too

811
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,193
And we don't care about our own faults

812
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,918
Talking about our own style

813
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,600
All we care about is talking

814
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:25,269
Talking only me and you

815
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:28,712
And we don't care about the young folks

816
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,278
Talking about the young style

817
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,153
And we don't care about the old folks

818
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,714
Talking about the old style too

819
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,952
And we don't care about our own faults

820
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,233
Talking about our own style

821
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,478
All we care about is talking

822
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,160
Talking only me and you

823
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,190
Talking only me and you

824
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,599
Dear David Bowie,

825
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:07,110
sometimes it seems like things
actually work out.

826
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:16,838
English, Irene. English. There is
no such thing as conversational Elvish.

827
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,759
Sorry, Dewey.

828
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,310
It's what they call you, isn't it?

829
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,395
No.

830
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,672
It was at your last school.
Or do you prefer "Junior"?

831
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,189
Do you know your buddy,
his full name is Will Burton, Jr.?

832
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,673
Did you know that I don't care?

833
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,438
Well, he told you
his dad was famous, right?

834
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:39,279
Or infamous, right, Dewey?
I mean, you still close to the old man?

835
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,992
You probably don't get to talk to him
much anymore, do you?

836
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,749
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Well, I think you do, Dewey.

837
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,632
I think you do, Dewey.

838
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:57,237
Okay, that was surreal. Are you okay?

839
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,910
I don't... I got... I gotta...

840
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,278
What are you doing?

841
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:16,070
You didn't answer my texts,
and you left me alone with the monsters.

842
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,758
Sorry, I'm sick.

843
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,794
My spidey-sense tells me you're lying.

844
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,830
I'm thinking about changing schools.

845
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,111
No way, my little friend. I'm not facing
the Neanderthals without you.

846
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:32,597
Besides, if you change schools,
then you can't gain access to this.

847
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,715
-What's that?
-Something private.

848
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,918
Something I would only show
the manager of my band.

849
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,158
Or my best friend.

850
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,555
Scooch.

851
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:50,031
Okay. You said we needed one song
that says who we are.

852
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,435
Well, these say who I am.

853
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:56,959
Little brothers.

854
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,512
Little brothers again.

855
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,878
-For your dad?
-No.

856
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,992
Not for him, exactly.

857
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,916
Inspired by him, I guess.
You know, things he said to me.

858
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:13,350
But it's not just about my dad anymore.
That'd be, hello, weird.

859
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,277
It's about everything.

860
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,152
Wow, that's articulate.

861
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:19,789
You know, there's other stuff in here, too.

862
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,718
-I'm not saying any of it's good...
-Thanks.

863
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:28,115
Hey. By accepting this, it means that there
will be no more talk of changing schools.

864
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,035
Agreed?

865
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,751
-Man, I'm good.
-Charlotte!

866
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,988
-Charlotte! My mom is in the...
-I knew you were ticklish.

867
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:40,315
You are so ticklish, I knew it.

868
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:45,078
Somebody wanna tell me
what's going on in here?

869
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,679
Get off his bed.

870
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,151
Wait. You don't think...

871
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:55,436
I saw you kiss him in the car.

872
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,751
Well, that was
for educational purposes only.

873
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:58,835
I wanna die.

874
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,269
Did you hear that? He wants to die.
He needs help, Karen.

875
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,391
Then I'll help him. I'm his mom.

876
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,476
But I am wise in the ways of Will.

877
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:09,912
I'm actually here, you know. These covers
don't literally make me disappear.

878
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,395
You know what I think?
I think you're full of it, Charlotte.

879
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,795
And when I think someone's full of it,
I don't trust them.

880
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,797
Mom, will you stop interfering?

881
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,639
Sorry, I'm not your friend,
I'm your mother. That's my job.

882
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,912
No, Mom, you're supposed to give me
a little breathing room so I can have a life,

883
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:26,270
instead of just saying that's what you want.

884
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,994
-He's got a point, Karen.
-And you, I'm not a manager.

885
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:33,238
I don't take on the biggest band
in school and change destiny. I can't.

886
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,279
Will you both just please leave me alone?

887
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,189
Get out.

888
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:58,076
-Somebody called me Dewey today.
-What? How?

889
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:01,158
-He must've found out about Dad.
-I hate them all.

890
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,430
-Me too.
-You, however, I love.

891
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:07,269
Yeah, but you married Dad.
We can't really trust your taste.

892
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,832
I was 19. And he was a drummer.

893
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,671
And overnight it made my mother
finally take me seriously,

894
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,153
which is really all I wanted.

895
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,235
-Mom?
-l... What?

896
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:20,318
You're doing that thing
where you talk to me like I'm Oprah.

897
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:24,399
I'll tell you this, though.
I'd marry him all over again to get you.

898
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:33,599
I promise you're going to get
everything you deserve out of life.

899
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:36,075
And a little bit of the next guy's.

900
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,272
I'll never be

901
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:53,518
A knight in armor with a sword in hand

902
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:57,000
Or a kamikaze fighter

903
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,749
Don't count on me

904
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:06,030
To storm the barricades and take a stand

905
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:09,315
Or hold my ground

906
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:15,192
You'll never see any scars or wounds

907
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,148
I don't walk on coals

908
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:21,278
I won't walk on water

909
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,914
I am no prince

910
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,629
I am no saint

911
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:33,068
I am not anyone's wildest dream

912
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:37,234
But I will stand behind

913
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:41,797
And be someone to fall back on

914
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,159
That's the song.

915
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,151
Some comedy

916
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,318
You're bruised and beaten down

917
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:09,592
And I am the one who's looking for a favor

918
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,311
Still, honestly

919
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:16,116
You don't believe me
But the things I have

920
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:19,040
Are the things you need

921
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,276
You look at me like I don't make sense

922
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:28,111
Like a waste of time
Like it serves no purpose

923
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,551
I am no prince
I am no saint

924
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:37,958
And if that's what you believe you need

925
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:41,352
You're wrong
You don't need much

926
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:45,395
You need someone to fall back on

927
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:51,871
And I'll be that
I'll take your side

928
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,197
If I'm the only one

929
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:57,754
I'm used to that

930
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,911
I've been alone

931
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:04,192
I'd rather be

932
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,910
The half of us

933
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,311
The least of you

934
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:14,798
The best of me

935
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,395
And I will be

936
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,718
I'll be your prince
I'll be your saint

937
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:27,473
I will go crashing through fences
in your name

938
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,990
I will, I swear

939
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:33,669
I'll be someone to fall back on

940
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,870
I'll be the one who waits

941
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:41,596
And for as long as you let me

942
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:45,959
I will be the one you need

943
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,836
I'll be someone to fall back on

944
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:08,319
Someone to fall back on

945
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:17,274
One to fall back on

946
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,553
Dear David Bowie,

947
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:33,753
just when it looked like things
might be okay,

948
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,154
disaster struck.

949
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:38,635
What's going on? Where is everybody?

950
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:42,754
-Art class is canceled today.
-Why? What happened?

951
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,275
Charlotte's father passed away.

952
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,192
I assumed you knew.

953
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,235
No.

954
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,314
This was a mistake. We shouldn't be here.

955
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,549
She didn't return any of my calls.

956
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,510
-You going to be okay?
-Yeah.

957
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:17,675
Okay.

958
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,714
Go, she's your friend. She needs you.

959
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,872
- Boys...
- I got them.

960
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:44,868
Charlotte?

961
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,234
I'm sorry.

962
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:54,629
I called.

963
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:57,673
I don't know if you got any of my messages.

964
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,717
Yeah, I got them. Thanks.

965
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,509
I wish you would've called me back.

966
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,189
Why?

967
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:09,709
"Why?"

968
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,594
I don't know. I mean, you told Ben.

969
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:13,675
So?

970
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,349
Is anything wrong?

971
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:17,515
Yeah.

972
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,075
Yeah, my dad died.

973
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,633
No, I know.

974
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:24,036
I wish I could've met him.
I'm sure he was a great man.

975
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,675
He was.

976
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,758
I got to do this.

977
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:35,994
Charlotte.

978
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,314
Charlotte.

979
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,112
-What do you want, Will?
-What do I want?

980
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,958
I just want you to know that I'm here
for you.

981
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,718
Okay, got it. What else?

982
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,638
And not to worry about the daycare.
I can handle that until you come back.

983
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:49,715
That's it.

984
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:50,716
Listen, I'm sorry, okay.

985
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:53,115
It's just a lot to deal with right now,
and I sort of want to be alone.

986
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,355
Okay. I get it, yeah.

987
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:55,515
And look, about the band...

988
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:59,952
Don't even worry about the band, okay?
We'll use Phil's Song for Bandslam.

989
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:02,800
Or not. We don't have to use Phil's Song.
We can find another song, or...

990
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,309
Hey, go ahead. Knock yourselves out.

991
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:12,280
I mean, it's a beautiful song, Charlotte.

992
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,190
It would make your dad proud.
It would be like he's there.

993
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,390
Stop! Please, just stop!

994
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,992
There is no us, Will. I'm not in the band.

995
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:23,112
What? No, no, no.
Okay, we'll find another song...

996
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:26,119
It's not about the song. I quit. I just quit.

997
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,514
-Why?
-I don't do "why"!

998
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:30,279
No, you have to. You just have to!

999
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:38,435
Please.

1000
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,391
You really want to know why?

1001
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,268
Last summer, when my dad got sick,

1002
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:55,153
I promised God, the universe,

1003
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:59,118
anyone who'd listen,

1004
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,752
that I'd be different.

1005
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,599
Better. Nicer.

1006
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,598
My dad hated the way I acted
when I was with Ben.

1007
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:12,913
The way I treated kids who weren't popular.

1008
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,959
So, I changed.

1009
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:20,477
I started volunteering with the monsters.
I left my friends. I left my band.

1010
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,397
I left everything that set me apart
from people like...

1011
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:26,789
Me.

1012
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,909
People like me.

1013
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,832
So we were just this

1014
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,639
experiment to try and make your dad okay?

1015
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,512
No, I know how crazy this must sound...

1016
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,473
Honestly, Charlotte,
the thing that never made sense

1017
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,398
was you being my friend in the first place.

1018
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,671
Hey!
While you're up there on your high horse,

1019
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,837
ask yourself who are you
to judge me about lying?

1020
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,229
Dewey!

1021
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,155
That stands for DWl, right?

1022
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,191
Driving while intoxicated?

1023
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,237
I don't know what's worse.

1024
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:21,071
Losing a father you love so much
you change your whole life for him,

1025
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:29,158
or having a father you're so ashamed of,
you make up a whole life for him.

1026
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,951
Can I have some beef jerky?

1027
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:08,079
Is he kidding?

1028
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,271
You warned me about her.

1029
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,112
I didn't listen.

1030
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:19,789
She can't help it.
It's how girls like that are hardwired.

1031
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,390
How are we hardwired?

1032
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:30,275
I mean, sure, right now, I am just a kid.

1033
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:31,549
Whatever.

1034
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,157
What's going to change?

1035
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,434
Nothing.

1036
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,078
I'm just going to be

1037
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,234
unhappy,

1038
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,115
alone,

1039
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:51,998
scared of, like, everything.

1040
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,397
You're not alone, Will.

1041
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,957
Experiment? We were just her experiment?

1042
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,318
I keep thinking...

1043
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:11,629
What?

1044
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:15,999
Well, if you were just part of
Charlotte's experiment this whole time,

1045
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,872
then, what is reality?

1046
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,437
What if Charlotte and her experiment are

1047
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,597
really a part of someone else's
larger experiment?

1048
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:28,476
I mean, what if we're being manipulated
by some greater intelligence than our own?

1049
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,797
And if so, is there really such a thing
as free will?

1050
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:35,268
Am I moving my hand,

1051
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,836
or was it predetermined by a force
I'm not even aware of?

1052
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:42,153
Charlotte times a trillion.

1053
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,189
See, this is why you don't have friends!

1054
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:56,517
All right, this is ridiculous! She doesn't
get to make our whole lives a lie!

1055
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,712
I mean, it was real for me.
Wasn't it real for you?

1056
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:03,835
I say we refuse to let Charlotte
screw this up for us.

1057
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:06,030
I mean, we've worked too hard.

1058
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:09,632
We're doing Bandslam.

1059
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:11,195
- You're crazy.
- Why?

1060
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:13,038
How long have you got?

1061
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,433
It won't work.
What song are we going to do?

1062
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:17,959
Phil's Song. She said we could.

1063
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:20,548
Oh, yeah? And who's going to sing it?

1064
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:08,113
You say your patience is longer
than my face

1065
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:14,032
Oh, yeah, but I can see right through
your plastic case

1066
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:19,591
Oh, you're running round
like your life is some type of race

1067
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:25,157
You know I'm trying
but I cannot keep your pace

1068
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:29,792
Oh, so take your blizzard
somewhere else, little girl

1069
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,388
Your stormy weather ain't welcome here

1070
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,111
I Can't Go On, I'll Go On.

1071
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,472
Can't not buy it, buy it.

1072
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,354
-Hey.
-Hey.

1073
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:48,199
How are the guys holding up?
Have you been backstage?

1074
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:51,118
Yeah, they're fine. Actually, they're great.

1075
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,675
Think I'll go and wish them luck.

1076
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:55,675
Okay.

1077
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:05,272
Hey! Dennis Ardmore.

1078
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:07,476
What?

1079
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,273
Dennis Ardmore.
Does that name ring a bell?

1080
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,279
No. Should it?

1081
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:16,952
I guess not. I just didn't know how much
research you all had done, so...

1082
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:19,389
But he would've been about your age now.

1083
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:22,478
Except that Will's father got drunk in
the middle of the afternoon,

1084
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,113
Iike he did every afternoon,

1085
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:27,516
and ran him over while he was walking
home from school.

1086
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:30,070
I heard. I'm sorry.

1087
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:34,113
Yeah. Did you hear that Will insisted
that I bring him to the funeral?

1088
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:36,117
That's what kind of kid he is.

1089
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:39,994
Twelve years old, he walks right up to
Dennis Ardmore's parents,

1090
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,476
and asked their forgiveness.

1091
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,317
Everyone hated Will's dad.

1092
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,635
Well, who wouldn't? I mean...

1093
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:58,197
And then they put him away, and it's
like they just turned it all on his kid.

1094
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:59,719
It was awful.

1095
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,308
So just give him a break.

1096
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,670
Please? Not a lot of people have.

1097
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:10,595
So I don't know what you were planning
on saying to him, or doing, but just don't.

1098
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:12,713
Just don't. Okay?

1099
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:15,752
Don't make up with him. Don't be his friend.

1100
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:18,275
Why not?

1101
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,915
Because, I don't think he'll recover
if you leave him twice.

1102
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,550
I've never met a kid like Will.

1103
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:29,837
My friends have never met a kid like Will.

1104
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:32,793
The monsters have never met a kid like Will.

1105
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:36,795
And I want you to let me apologize to him
because I want to keep knowing him.

1106
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:39,434
You know, I like who I am
when I'm with Will.

1107
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:43,439
And I will do anything in the world
to be that person again.

1108
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:47,833
So, please,

1109
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,438
don't ask me not to.

1110
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,115
Okay.

1111
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,474
Thank you.

1112
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,599
I said, "Okay." I'm not going to hug you.

1113
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:06,630
Okay.

1114
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:09,710
And by the way,
I'm really glad you don't wear

1115
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,070
those little groupie outfits
all the time, Karen.

1116
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,872
You'll need this.

1117
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,148
All right.

1118
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:22,235
And I'm so sorry about your father.

1119
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:46,797
Tax and total it for me

1120
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:54,075
I'll pay my bill and run so fast

1121
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:00,559
Separation is our love now

1122
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:03,432
Well, we're toast.

1123
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:06,595
I don't know. They're okay.

1124
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:08,595
I hear the band to watch

1125
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:12,679
is I Can't Drive Stick, I'll Drive Stick,
or something like that.

1126
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,717
Look, let me just speak.

1127
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:24,635
The whole experiment thing,
not my finest hour.

1128
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:30,432
I was angry and stupid
and really, really confused.

1129
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,639
And I'm sorry.

1130
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:39,472
Are you kidding me?

1131
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,113
Okay, quick recap:

1132
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:43,959
Charlotte dumps Ben,
turns you guys into a band,

1133
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,196
finds the genius that is Will,

1134
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,515
then, does one stupid thing

1135
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:51,631
because her father has died,

1136
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,035
realizes, and comes to apologize.

1137
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,639
And you're not going to
accept the apology?

1138
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:03,153
Plus, I really miss you guys.

1139
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,353
Is that real?

1140
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:09,469
Hundred percent.

1141
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:15,356
The only thing that matters is seeing
you guys kick some serious butt tonight.

1142
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,030
And you're singing Phil's Song.

1143
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,035
-ls that okay?
-Yeah. Of course.

1144
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:27,674
And I'll be the girl in front,
screaming my head off while you do.

1145
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:42,750
Keep it hot like steam, that's your dream

1146
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,359
Baby, get up off me

1147
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:47,951
It's so clean, the way I've been
Gots me looking glossy

1148
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:51,197
On the scene with the queen
That be acting bossy

1149
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:54,915
I don 't want no drama, little mama
So please get up off me

1150
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:58,517
Yeah, you know how I blow
Till you're feeling dizzy

1151
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:00,437
Lots of soul, that's the goal

1152
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:04,835
Yeah, go ahead. Copy that.

1153
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:06,598
Way to be im partial.

1154
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:09,434
Way to be realistic about your chances.

1155
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,070
Way to say "way" just because I did.

1156
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,760
Yeah. Standing by. Follow spots.

1157
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:19,951
And now, from Martin Van Buren
High School in Lodi, New Jersey,

1158
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,640
Ben Wheatly and the Glory Dogs!

1159
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,958
You're number one!

1160
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:34,068
Thank you.

1161
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,512
Thank you so much.

1162
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:46,228
I'd like to dedicate this next song
to someone very special to me.

1163
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:49,038
She taught me a lot,

1164
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,037
and she wrote this song.

1165
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:54,274
So, Charlotte, this one's for you.

1166
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,519
I'll never be

1167
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:04,472
A knight in armor with a sword in hand

1168
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:07,038
Whoa, whoa! No, no, no!

1169
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,511
Don't count on me

1170
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:14,110
To storm the barricades and take a stand

1171
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:16,435
I didn't know. I swear. I didn't know.

1172
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:17,879
-No, no, no.
-What?

1173
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,513
You'll never see

1174
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:23,789
It's old. Ben knew it. He probably thought
he was doing something nice for me.

1175
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,990
I had no idea, Karen.
You've got to believe me!

1176
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:28,079
I am no prince

1177
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:29,873
I am no saint

1178
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:33,112
I am not anyone's wildest dream

1179
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:35,674
What are we going to do?
We can't sing the same song.

1180
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,756
I don't know anything else.

1181
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:39,709
Yes, you do.

1182
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:42,752
And it's famous and only has, like,
four chords.

1183
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:44,399
Alley. Now!

1184
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:47,751
Someone to fall back on

1185
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:10,432
Someone to fall back on

1186
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,228
Come on!

1187
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:30,395
We need another minute.

1188
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:31,589
We don't have another minute! They just...

1189
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:33,790
We need another minute!

1190
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:43,196
Our last band is also from
Martin Van Buren High.

1191
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:45,790
I don't know what they're putting
in the water in Lodi,

1192
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:49,435
but give it up for I Can't Go On, I'll Go On!

1193
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:55,398
That's us! Come on!

1194
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:57,948
What's going on?

1195
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,433
Get on stage.

1196
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:01,711
-Where?
-On stage!

1197
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:04,799
-Why? No! What am I going to do?
-You're going to stall!

1198
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:07,388
-They hate me.
-Go!

1199
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:26,993
Say something, for God's sake,
say something.

1200
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:32,749
Dewey!

1201
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:37,989
Dewey!

1202
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:39,394
Oh, my God!

1203
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,355
Dewey!

1204
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:45,678
Where's the band?

1205
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,149
Dewey!

1206
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:48,595
Dewey.

1207
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:49,789
Dewey!

1208
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:53,314
Dewey!

1209
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:06,151
Dewey! Dewey! Dewey!

1210
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:48,429
Dewey. Dewey. Dewey.

1211
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,950
Dewey. Come on! Dewey.

1212
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:59,595
Dewey. Dewey. Dewey.

1213
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:01,392
Dewey... Yeah, come on!

1214
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,239
Dewey! Dewey! Dewey!

1215
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:07,352
Do we want to rock?

1216
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:12,118
Wake up, New Jersey!

1217
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:16,877
I said, do we want to rock?

1218
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:26,469
Because I have seen the future

1219
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:28,079
and their name is,

1220
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:31,875
I Can't Go On, I'll Go On!

1221
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,475
You shelter me from harm

1222
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:28,111
You kept me warm

1223
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:31,159
Kept me warm

1224
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:34,719
You gave my life to me

1225
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:36,798
Set me free

1226
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,589
Set me free

1227
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:43,750
The finest years I ever knew

1228
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:47,320
All the years I had with you

1229
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:51,035
And I would give everything I own

1230
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:52,115
One time

1231
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:55,516
Give up my life, my heart, my home

1232
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:56,550
Two times

1233
01:31:56,680 --> 01:32:00,559
I would give everything I own

1234
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:04,591
Just to have you once again

1235
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:19,634
You taught me how to love

1236
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:22,076
What it's of

1237
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:24,555
What it's of

1238
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:28,835
You never said too much
But still you showed the way

1239
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:33,317
And I knew from watching you

1240
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:37,516
Nobody else could ever know

1241
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:41,000
The part of me that can't let go

1242
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:45,193
And I would give everything I own

1243
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:49,474
Give up my life, my heart, my home

1244
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:53,993
I would give everything I own

1245
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:58,999
Just to have you once again

1246
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:03,154
Just to have you once again

1247
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:08,559
Is there someone you know

1248
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:10,830
You're loving them so

1249
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:14,919
But taking them all for granted

1250
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:17,556
You may lose them one day

1251
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:20,035
Someone takes them away

1252
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:25,917
And they don't hear the words
you long to say

1253
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:31,279
I would give everything I own

1254
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:35,679
Give up my life, my heart, my home

1255
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:40,194
I would give anything I own

1256
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:43,514
Just to have you

1257
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:46,031
I gotta have you

1258
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:48,833
I would give everything I own

1259
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,439
Everything I own

1260
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:52,596
Give up my life, my heart, my home

1261
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:57,149
I would give everything I own

1262
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:59,635
Everything, everything I own

1263
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:02,035
-Just to have you
-Just to have you

1264
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:06,992
I would give everything I own

1265
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:10,749
Give up my life, my heart, my home

1266
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:15,758
I would give everything I own

1267
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:20,078
Give up my life, my heart, my home

1268
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:21,474
I would give

1269
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:48,629
Everything, everything I own
Everything, everything I own

1270
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:51,832
Everything, everything I own
Everything, everything l

1271
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:03,590
Own

1272
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:05,439
Dude! That was sick!

1273
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:09,992
The whole thing with Ben singing
the song, I swear, I didn't know.

1274
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:11,879
I know. I know.

1275
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,912
That... They were ridiculously good!

1276
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:16,917
Who are you? You are...

1277
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:19,315
-Mom.
-Where do you come from?

1278
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:23,798
Cute lead singer I hope to make
my girlfriend is actually laughing at me.

1279
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:26,032
All right. Fine.

1280
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,238
It's time to leave.

1281
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:48,709
And the winner ofthis year's Bandslam is...

1282
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:06,476
From Greenwich High School in
Greenwich, Connecticut, The Daze!

1283
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:30,196
Over here, please.

1284
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:31,833
Can we get a sm iley one right here?

1285
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:34,315
- One more.
- $10,000.

1286
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:38,155
The part of me that can't let go

1287
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:41,877
Forget The Daze,
these guys rocked harder than anybody.

1288
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,274
You should post it.

1289
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:46,790
Give up my life,
my heart, my home

1290
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:54,194
If you feel like singing a song

1291
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:58,232
And you want other people to sing along

1292
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:02,955
Then just sing what you feel

1293
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:06,072
Don't let anyone say it's wrong

1294
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:11,638
And if you're trying to paint a picture

1295
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:15,631
But you're not sure which colors belong

1296
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:20,429
Just paint what you see

1297
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:22,198
Don't let anyone say it's wrong

1298
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:23,309
Hey!

1299
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:25,916
KYra17 -1, what's up?

1300
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:28,190
I told you, the dash is silent.

1301
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:33,356
Or stung awake in the night

1302
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:37,675
It's all right to be frightened

1303
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:40,356
When there's a light

1304
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:41,754
What light?

1305
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:44,237
There's a light

1306
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:45,713
What light?

1307
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,276
There's a light

1308
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:49,719
White light

1309
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:52,157
There's a light

1310
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:53,349
White light

1311
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:55,838
Well, there's a light

1312
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:57,514
One light

1313
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:59,519
There's a light

1314
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:01,514
White light

1315
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:03,149
And there's a light

1316
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:04,952
Dear Will Burton,

1317
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:07,036
it says on your MySpace page

1318
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:10,072
that you manage I Can 't Go On, I'll Go On.

1319
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:11,874
Nice name.

1320
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,718
I really like your band.

1321
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:16,308
You know, I'm starting an indie label.

1322
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:19,473
Are you signed to anyone?

1323
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:22,068
Maybe we can sit down and have a chat.

1324
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:25,874
Oh, my God!

1325
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:32,035
All the best,

1326
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,119
David Bowie.

1327
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:37,237
White light

1328
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,078
Well, there's a light

1329
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:40,474
White light

1330
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:43,037
There's a light

1331
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:44,513
White light

1332
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:46,559
There's a light

1333
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:48,952
White light

1334
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:50,832
There's a light

1335
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:52,234
-Hey.
-Hey.

1336
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:54,149
Smile.

1337
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:00,913
-Hey.
-Hey.

1338
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:03,076
-You look great.
-Thanks.

1339
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:05,998
It's my new makeup,
"l Can't Wear Blush, I'll Wear Blush."

1340
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:11,474
- Hey, you got room for one more?
- No!

1341
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:12,510
- Shotgun.
- No way.

1342
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:14,915
I called shotgun like an hour ago.

1343
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:53,436
Don't it blow your mind?

1344
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:57,313
Don't it blow your mind like the first time?

1345
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:01,833
Circle of voices
in a crowded room

1346
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:06,998
Plays in my head
so out of time

1347
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:14,358
Kill me with kindness
never enough I find

1348
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:17,990
Don't it blow your mind?

1349
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:21,229
Don't it blow your mind again?

1350
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:24,792
Don't it blow your mind for the third time?

1351
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:28,395
The dream is never over

1352
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:34,799
The dream is never over

1353
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:41,718
Envision a future still in black and white

1354
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:46,592
Colors of youth run into gold

1355
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:54,116
Blue is for sorrow,
red is for sadder light

1356
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:57,476
Don't it blow your mind?

1357
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,675
Don't it blow your mind again?

1358
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:04,352
Don't it blow your mind for the third time?

1359
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:07,710
The dream is never over

1360
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:14,199
The dream is never over

1361
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:40,354
To my favorite teacher

1362
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:42,436
Told me never give up

1363
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,790
To my fifth grade crush

1364
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:47,070
Who I thought I really loved

1365
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:51,671
To the guys I miss
and the girls we kissed

1366
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:54,439
Where are you now?

1367
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:58,670
To my ex-best friends

1368
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,995
Don't know how we grew apart

1369
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:03,350
To my favorite band

1370
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:05,675
And sing-alongs in my car

1371
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:10,316
To the face I see
in my memories

1372
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:13,193
Where are you now?

1373
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:17,275
Where are you now?

1374
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:19,630
'Cause I'm thinking of you

1375
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,876
You showed me how

1376
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,230
How to live like I do

1377
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:26,510
If it wasn't for you

1378
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:31,998
I would never be who I am

1379
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:35,989
To my first girlfriend

1380
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:38,270
I thought for sure
was the one

1381
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:40,550
To my last girlfriend

1382
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:42,955
Sorry that I screwed it up

1383
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:45,594
To the ones I loved

1384
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:47,551
Didn't show it enough

1385
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:50,717
Where are you now?

1386
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:54,476
Where are you now?

1387
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:56,875
'Cause I'm thinking of you

1388
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,150
You showed me how

1389
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:01,510
How to live like I do

1390
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:03,915
If it wasn't for you

1391
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:08,318
I would never be who I am

1392
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:13,758
I know we'll never see
those days again

1393
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:17,830
And things will never
be that way again

1394
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:20,155
But that's just how it goes

1395
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:22,430
People change but I know

1396
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:24,710
I won't forget you

1397
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:46,080
To the ones who cared

1398
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:48,077
And who were there
from the start

1399
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:50,509
To the love that left

1400
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:52,676
And took a piece of my heart

1401
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:55,189
To the few who'd swear

1402
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:57,515
They'd never go anywhere

1403
01:44:57,640 --> 01:45:00,598
Where are you now?

1404
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:04,555
Where are you now?

1405
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:06,830
'Cause I'm thinking of you

1406
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:09,030
You showed me how

1407
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:11,469
How to live like I do

1408
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:13,830
If it wasn't for you

1409
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:19,637
I would never be who I am

1410
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:23,155
If it wasn't for you

1411
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:28,229
I would never be who I am

1412
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:32,395
If it wasn't for you

1413
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:33,999
I'd be nothing

1414
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:37,270
Where are you now?

1415
01:46:30,120 --> 01:46:31,270
