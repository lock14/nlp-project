1
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,916
My name is Antoni Clarke,
and I am a bride's best friend.

2
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,109
I'm not gay.

3
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,749
<i>Now, I own "Confetti" magazine,</i>
<i>but Vivien is the editor,</i>

4
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,513
<i>and she's really</i>
<i>the backbone of the publication.</i>

5
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,036
She does all the day-to-day work, if you like.

6
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,750
This will be the event of the year. We have
to really go for it as the event of the year.

7
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,597
It's immense, because our reputation
is hanging on a thread if we fail in this.

8
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,592
It's half an hour on a Saturday afternoon.

9
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,750
Three weddings. It's easy.

10
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,152
All you have to do is hold up a card
and say, "Ten out of ten," or, <i>"Nil points."</i>

11
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,915
We were going to do
another Bride of the Year competition,

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,039
but we thought that would just end up being
given to a woman in a white dress again.

13
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,033
<i>So we thought we'd do</i>
<i>The Most Original Wedding as an idea.</i>

14
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,274
<i>We're giving away a house</i>
<i>to the couple with the most original wedding.</i>

15
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,069
Not everyone
wants to get married in a crazy way.

16
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:08,757
Not everyone wants their special day
ruined by a gimmick. But some people do.

17
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,519
Pitch us your vision
of the most original wedding.

18
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,388
OK. Well, erm, we're really
into dinosaurs, raptors, actually.

19
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,031
- It's a dinosaur themed wedding?
- Absolutely. We want it in a cave, first of all.

20
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,873
- Thanks so much for coming.
- Already? So soon?

21
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,554
I don't want to waste your time.

22
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,108
Hi, hello. Thank you so much for coming.

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,231
All the guys are going to be dressed
as Elvis Presley.

24
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,437
And the girls will be dressed as teddy girls.

25
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,557
- Do you think it's been done before?
- No.

26
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,153
Right. Next.

27
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,789
Vivien, am I going to be
meeting more mental people today?

28
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,510
We're going to get married
following the Daffodil Route round Wales.

29
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,512
It's a train route, it starts at Cardiff...

30
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,717
I appreciate you want to win a house,
it's not gonna happen.

31
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,155
Good three changes
on the way here.

32
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,913
You fucking loved it, didn't you?
You love the train.

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,434
You know, she was tremendously pretty.

34
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,114
We could partner her up with somebody else.

35
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,239
Well, what we had in mind
was a kind of ancient Roman wedding.

36
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,594
Great!

37
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,878
It starts with the sacrifice of a pig
at the bride's house.

38
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,709
Fuck me.

39
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,713
But maybe with some hairstyle around it,
and prescription lens.

40
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,756
Oh... Next.

41
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,831
Get out.

42
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,390
If we were producing a sort of
updated version of <i>The Joy of Sex,</i>

43
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,358
you two would be perfect.

44
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,713
<i>Naturists, or "The Joy of Sex"?</i>

45
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,236
<i>The Joy of Sex</i> are better-looking,
but the naturists...

46
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,515
Well, it's more... It's more <i>Confetti.</i>

47
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,637
Well, I don't want them at all.
I'd rather have the Romans.

48
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,555
That's as may be. Naturists, tennis, musicals.

49
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,430
Our submission was accepted,

50
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,990
and our submission, by the way,
we should probably say, is musicals.

51
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,310
- A musical wedding.
- Hollywood musicals.

52
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,118
That's what we're going for.

53
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,838
<i>The idea that we picked is,</i>
<i>it's in the style of the sort of Busby Berkeley,</i>

54
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,195
<i>so it's a big kind of production number.</i>

55
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,955
We're having the sort of bridesmaids
as the chorus girls.

56
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,955
You know, they have the sweeping kind
of staircase of bridesmaids in those films,

57
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,795
and Jen, my sister, obviously,
she'll be bridesmaid of honor, won't she?

58
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,836
- Absolutely.
- She's away at the moment.

59
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,309
She's a dancer.
She's in Bahrain with a cruise.

60
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,790
<i>She travels around a lot,</i>
<i>we don't always know where she is.</i>

61
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:53,076
Erm, I work in a care home for the elderly.
Sam comes along sometimes and helps out.

62
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,469
She sings for them, lovely.

63
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,199
I'm slightly tone-deaf, but Matt's always said

64
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,556
if I wasn't tone-deaf,
I'd have a very good voice.

65
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,349
- Yeah, I think that's true.
- So, you know, I enjoy it.

66
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,718
It's all confidence, that's all it is.
A lot of it is confidence.

67
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,877
Well, the vision for our wedding
is quite simple. Tennis.

68
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,155
Tennis.

69
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,755
Yeah! Whoo! Come on, Josef.

70
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,798
I mean, we are gonna win.
If you're listening, losers,

71
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,269
the other people in the competition,
give it up.

72
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,669
- Stop.
- Stop now, cos we're gonna win.

73
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,110
It's not about how good our wedding is,
it's about can we do anything to make theirs...

74
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,876
That's what you do in tennis. You look at
someone's game, and you have to destroy it.

75
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,597
Yeah, we have a coach. Well, I say "coach"...

76
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,750
- We have a coach.
- He's, uh...

77
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,719
Jesus. He's amazing. He's so supportive.

78
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,997
My inner game has gone at the moment,
he's working on that with me.

79
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,355
So in the court, that's what we're working on.

80
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,353
- He's very interested in getting inside you.
- He's fantastic at it.

81
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,794
<i>- Well, I'm Michael, this is Joanna.</i>
<i>- Joanna.</i>

82
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,872
And, er, yeah,
I've been a naturist all my life.

83
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,076
Joanna's... Oh.

84
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,948
And Joanna's quite new to it, really. Um...

85
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,031
I'm a beginner.

86
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,950
<i>Summerland. It's the oldest</i>
<i>naturist camp in the country.</i>

87
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,316
Mum and Dad lived here,
and they were naturists.

88
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,552
<i>Well, my dad was a policeman,</i>
<i>my mum worked as a legal secretary.</i>

89
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,077
And they do think...
They do worry a bit that I'm in a cult.

90
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,070
It's not a cult.

91
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,395
It's not a cult.

92
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,355
- I mean, we are all naked, apart from clothes.
- All the time.

93
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,238
And when you take the clothes off,
it's more obvious.

94
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,677
I know I'm... For this film, I'm supposed
to sit like this so you can't see my penis,

95
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:11,278
but, you know, I'm looking at my penis now,
and it seems absolutely fine to me.

96
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,113
Now, the auditions we had, I was very
excited about it, but I'm not particularly now.

97
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,988
<i>One is a potential idea,</i>
<i>perhaps, the musical couple.</i>

98
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,039
No, no, no, we're going back
to singing out of tune again, dear.

99
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,554
The tennis couple maybe could work.

100
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,950
But the girl,
she has the most extraordinary nostrils.

101
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,759
I mean, I can't take my eyes off them.

102
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,630
If you put that on a front cover, the nation
won't be able to take their eyes off them.

103
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,836
The third choice...

104
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,672
Oh.

105
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,311
I mean, where do you want me to start?
They want to be on the front cover naked.

106
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,391
But I'm optimistic.

107
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,871
I have my wedding planners
coming in soon, and...

108
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,952
Heron and Hough,
and they seem absolutely dynamic.

109
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,876
Push a bit from the other side.
That's it. You all right?

110
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,314
Come in, come in.

111
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,789
- Hi!
- Hello.

112
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,954
This is my partner.

113
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,315
- Heron and Hough.
- Your dreams are enough.

114
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,835
I think this is going to be
the most extraordinary,

115
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,912
theatrical, wedding love celebration.

116
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,560
- Three-ring circus.
- A three-ring circus of love.

117
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,596
We're going to be right at its center.

118
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,838
Don't show them that.
Come away, don't show them that.

119
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,558
- This...
- No, stop it.

120
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,918
This is our award wall.

121
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,753
- You shouldn't show them that, Archie.
- I know, but...

122
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,876
Don't show them that one, or that one.

123
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,676
<i>We're not clear on budget, are we?</i>

124
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,433
<i>But the great thing is,</i>
<i>it's a big magazine.</i>

125
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,354
So I think we're safely assuming
there will be some money to spend.

126
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,509
Just a little bit.

127
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,230
<i>So we've already started. We haven't</i>
<i>met the couples, but we have a load of ideas</i>

128
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,871
<i>- that we wanted to kind of spring on them.</i>
<i>- And I think one's first instinct is the best.</i>

129
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,157
- Black and silver sparkle.
- Oh, lovely. Good choice.

130
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,831
<i>Also we're up against time.</i>

131
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,832
<i>We would often plan a wedding</i>
<i>over 9, 12, 18 months,</i>

132
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,912
<i>and we have three months</i>
<i>to plan three weddings.</i>

133
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,199
<i>- Which we're up for.</i>
<i>- Mad as cheese, the pair of us. As cheese.</i>

134
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:25,354
What we give people is a huge part
of ourselves. It's our wedding, on the day.

135
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,829
<i>- We have not lost one yet.</i>
<i>- No.</i>

136
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,196
There is nobody who has been married
at a wedding we have organized

137
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,952
who is not still together.

138
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,391
Oh, come on, don't serve so hard to her.

139
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,392
- What do you mean, don't serve so hard?
- You're a man...

140
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,471
Are you here? Are you in the room?

141
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,313
- Do it again.
- Do what again? Serve, so you can miss it?

142
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,391
Jesus is, uh...

143
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,473
exceptionally,
an exceptionally mediocre coach.

144
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,236
Oh, well, my name is Jesus
and I'm from Spain. Um...

145
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,639
Yup.

146
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,076
That's the difficulties of my name,
cos it's also called "Jesus".

147
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,950
I mean, if anyone goes around
calling himself "Jesus", frankly it's a bit sad.

148
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,033
There must be a deep well
of insecurity in there.

149
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,957
I will hurt if they getting married,

150
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,430
because I think
he is not the appropriate man for her.

151
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,956
Yeah, that's character.
I mean, she needs more love,

152
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,876
she needs more smiling,
and she needs a little bit more of sweetness.

153
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,437
- Back.
- It's really helping.

154
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,238
And front.

155
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,834
- Don't stop. I think this is good.
- What's good?

156
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,911
- Just wait. Keep going.
- You tired?

157
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,878
- No, I'm not... I'm not ti-red.
- You can sit down, yeah?

158
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,235
- Just for the...
- If anything, I'm "tired".

159
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,639
- Positive.
- Sorry.

160
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,838
Just for the opening, I was feeling something.
Take my hand.

161
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,514
- What were you feeling?
- That this could be used.

162
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,591
- For the wedding?
- Used in the wedding?

163
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,831
- That will be excellent.
- Who's getting married?

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,231
<i>He goes on about how</i>
<i>warm they are in the Mediterranean,</i>

165
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,077
<i>they're very tactile, but he doesn't touch</i>
<i>anyone as much as he touches my fiancée.</i>

166
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,151
I don't think...

167
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,271
Oi!

168
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,349
I'm watching.

169
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,190
<i>Rules of entry, number one: you</i>
<i>hereby confirm you're not already married.</i>

170
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,673
Two: you agree to participate
in pre-marriage counseling.

171
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,751
Counseling.

172
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,431
- Counseling.
- Yes.

173
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,391
- I'm not doing counseling.
- Josef...

174
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,759
I'm not doing counseling. I've done
counseling, you know that. I'm not doing it.

175
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,909
I'm not doing it!

176
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,275
Let's just concentrate
on how we want these people to look.

177
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,592
I mean, the tennis players, Isabelle and Josef.
We want them to look so glamorous.

178
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,310
- Well, we want them to win, don't we?
- Yes. I quite like, erm, the musical couple.

179
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,709
- They'll look wonderful.
- Sweet.

180
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,552
She's a little dowdy.

181
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,359
No, she'll be fine
if we dress her in a beautiful dress.

182
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,956
You never know on the day, either. The
naturist couple on the day might be fantastic.

183
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,429
I don't think anyone wants to see her muff.

184
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,590
You chose them.

185
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,314
<i>I was quite excited</i>
<i>by the people we met.</i>

186
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,075
I think of the three couples,
I think I wouldn't want to favor any of them.

187
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,914
I think they're all exciting,
they're very much in love, I think.

188
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,233
<i>I have slight problems with the tennis,</i>
<i>Isabelle and Josef.</i>

189
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,594
<i>A woman that only wears things that</i>
<i>she's knitted herself is going to be difficult.</i>

190
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,752
Yes, and they did smell.

191
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,516
- It was...
- It was a really good day.

192
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,513
- Yeah, it was an amazing day.
- There was so many things to see, and...

193
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,355
<i>And also from the time</i>
<i>that Sam had the makeover.</i>

194
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,509
<i>That would be enough, the fact that</i>
<i>she was chosen to have a makeover...</i>

195
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,079
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

196
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,756
<i>They just happened to pick her</i>

197
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,752
<i>to have a makeover</i>
<i>out of all those people in the audience.</i>

198
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,673
So we had to have a word.

199
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,512
A civil word.

200
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,230
And they kindly agreed to, uh, to go again.

201
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,999
Oh, doesn't she look gorgeous!

202
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:04,359
Big round of applause for the lovely Isabella.

203
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,795
Look, she's got herself in the picture.
She's got herself in the...

204
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,950
Just... See, at the back?

205
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,189
Hi.

206
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,153
- Oh, hi.
- Hello.

207
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,196
Come on in.

208
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,432
- Lovely to see you.
- You too. Perch yourself on the couch.

209
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,751
- Lovely to see you. In you come.
- Lovely to see you.

210
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:35,109
OK. Well, you know, first and foremost, thank
you so much for coming and doing this job.

211
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,237
- We are so excited.
- Good. I'm thrilled.

212
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,117
Now, to cut to the chase.

213
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,476
There are several things
that are on my mind at the moment.

214
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,439
Firstly, I need... And this has also
come from the powers-that-be above.

215
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,910
I need one venue for all three weddings.

216
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,150
For the wedding competition.

217
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,435
- For all the weddings?
- That's right, yes.

218
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,717
Cos we thought about
Queen's Club and Roland Garros.

219
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,997
Well, I love your ideas.
But they're not within the budget.

220
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,469
So, um, one venue.

221
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,838
Now, the second point is, and one
that does concern me over the naturists, erm,

222
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,277
I need... I need the naked girl dressed.
I need her in a dress.

223
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,959
- In a dress?
- In a dress.

224
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,713
- But they're nudists, aren't they?
- No, naturists.

225
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,314
Well, yes, but they take their clothes off.

226
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,392
- Well, I need them in a dress.
- Does she know that?

227
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,552
No. That's your job, to tell her.

228
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,914
Right.

229
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,915
- Do they actually play volleyball?
- We're going to find out.

230
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,958
I feel a bit sick, actually, Archie.

231
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,955
- Oh, my God.
- Oh! It's a naked man on a bike! A naked...

232
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,031
Just keep your eye on the road.

233
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,157
- Did you see?
- I'm choosing to ignore it.

234
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,754
No clothes on,
riding around...

235
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,308
Just pull up here. Pull up here.

236
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,198
Will there be any...
Yes, it'll be obvious, won't it?

237
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,953
- It'll be obvious when we meet them.
- What are they...

238
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,031
Hi!

239
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,753
- How you doing? You all right?
- Hey, there.

240
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,674
- Nice to see you again. Hi, how you doing?
- Hi. Joanna.

241
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,513
- Archie.
- Hi, there.

242
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,556
- Glad you made it.
- I stood on your toe.

243
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,835
- Oh, I'm all right.
- Thanks for coming.

244
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,275
- Well, let's...
- We'll show you round.

245
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,633
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

246
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,711
- Hi.
- Hi.

247
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,639
You know, you have a really good game
of badminton, then no need to wash your kit.

248
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,393
Well, that's a bonus.

249
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,074
- Do you play badminton?
- No.

250
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,628
You are aware that these weddings will all...

251
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,475
All three competitors will have their weddings
in the same venue, on the same day?

252
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,790
One after another, sort of concurrently.

253
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,758
- In a venue?
- It doesn't, it... No, I didn't know that.

254
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,229
No, it... it... it doesn't absolutely...

255
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,710
Well, it is clear,
but it isn't underlined, or anything.

256
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,076
It just says
you have to approve where we do it.

257
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,950
Well, the magazine approves, and they've
decided that to make it easier for the judges,

258
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,838
it all has to be inside and on one occasion.

259
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,276
- What's that?
- This is <i>Primavera.</i>

260
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,954
- Who's he?
- No, that's a painting by Botticelli.

261
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,395
- Oh, sorry.
- And it just... You said nature.

262
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,835
It explores some of the themes of nature.

263
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:22,153
You've got these apples, pears and things,
and the elements blowing on her,

264
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,915
and there's flowers and so on,
and the strength of this sword.

265
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,357
And she's just slightly veiled,
and you can see the nakedness underneath.

266
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,398
But that's just wacky costumes.
It's just costumes.

267
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,793
It's kind of theatre, isn't it?
It's not real. And we're about nature and real.

268
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,953
- Oh, hi. Thanks ever so much.
- Quite all right. Where do you want them?

269
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,076
I'll move those. Thanks.

270
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,152
- Quite all right.
- Thanks, Becky.

271
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,359
What do we do? They're going to want
to walk in and take their clothes off.

272
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,032
- Aren't they?
- Yes.

273
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,078
- You think we should allow that?
- If that's what they want.

274
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,119
Good. I think that too. If they want to do that,
they should be allowed to do that.

275
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,078
To ask them to get married, in...
you know, clothed,

276
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,594
is contrary to everything we believe in.

277
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,071
So, yes, they must be naked people as they
get married, because that's who they are.

278
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,673
Right. Lovely. So.

279
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,830
- Musical.
- Musicals. <i>The King And I.</i>

280
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,630
Oh, it's not <i>The King And I.</i>
Why does it have to be <i>The King And i?</i>

281
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,996
<i>- King And I</i> this, <i>King And I</i> that.
- It offers so much designwise.

282
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,834
It's East meets West, there's
a fantastic opportunity for food there,

283
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,354
you know I can...
I can get hold of elephants.

284
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,512
I'm thinking <i>Singin' in the Rain,</i>
I can just see it.

285
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,674
We can have the rain from the Wimbledon
falling all over the MGM and we'd just be...

286
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,479
Or <i>On the Town.</i> Oh, please, <i>On the Town.</i>

287
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,632
- I hate <i>On the Town.</i>
- How can you hate <i>On the Town?</i>

288
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,995
It's that woman in the cab.
She drives me mad.

289
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,911
Oh, she's wonderful.

290
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,632
So, folks. <i>El maestro.</i>

291
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,029
- This is Paul. Sam.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

292
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,554
Nice to meet you.

293
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,358
- Hi, Matt.
- Nice to see you.

294
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,714
Oh, how are you?

295
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,920
Paul has been working with us
on some ideas for your wedding,

296
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,992
- which we'd like to show you.
- This is nice, isn't it?

297
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,710
So we've put some stools out.
We've kind of... It's like a little show.

298
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,872
- If you could take the stools, we're going to...
- What, now?

299
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,439
- Right now.
- Take a pew.

300
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,752
And we want to show you what we've come
up with as potential vows for your wedding.

301
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,435
Shall I take my coat off?

302
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,271
- That is really amazing.
- Exciting, isn't it?

303
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,920
- That is... That's amazing.
- Do you like that?

304
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,595
Yeah. I love it, and it's a bit like ours.

305
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,910
- Show us.
- Ours isn't as good...

306
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,434
I'm sure it is,
we just cobbled that together.

307
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,751
I'm sure we can get some sort
of middle ground between the two.

308
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,428
You're both singing in different keys.

309
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,431
- Yep.
- Yeah, that's...

310
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,829
- Is that how?
...harmony.

311
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,313
We know now we can't be here, but if
we get married there, it has to be clothed.

312
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,789
- I don't...
- For me, it has to be clothed.

313
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,348
- But for me, it does have to be.
- You want it to be?

314
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,671
Well, I'm happy as a naturist with you,
and with naturists.

315
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,752
But I'm not happy being undressed
in front of clothed people.

316
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,071
It's been your life forever,
and I'm new to it still.

317
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,799
You won't give them nightmares.
You look beautiful.

318
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,555
- It's not... They'll laugh. Someone will laugh.
- They won't laugh.

319
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,235
I'm not prepared to feel shame
and feel humiliation on our wedding day.

320
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,518
It's completely their problem though.
I think it's your mum that does this.

321
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,672
Think about your mum now.
Picture your mum.

322
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,557
Do you want to get dressed?

323
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,393
Yes. See? There we go. It's her.

324
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,268
She's so... clothed.

325
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,754
I'm like Eno on speed.

326
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,910
It's just like you take the whole thing...

327
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,594
- Speedo.
- Speedo.

328
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,992
This is what we're like, innit?
This is what we used to be like.

329
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,072
- Well, we still are, it's all right.
- Yeah.

330
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,314
We can do <i>Wizard of Oz.</i> Right?

331
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,153
Well, <i>Wizard of Oz</i> is a musical, OK, all right?

332
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,268
- Do you mean at the wedding?
- Yes. You've got the bass, the Cowardly Lion.

333
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,796
The Tin Man on drums.
You've got Dorothy on guitar.

334
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,475
- You've got the, um, second guitar can be...
- Toto.

335
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,279
Toto, yes.
I could be the monkey with the wings.

336
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,195
I just think you're taking the mickey.
I don't think you're taking it seriously.

337
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,077
- Flaming Lips do it.
- It's not a joke.

338
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,754
It's not a joke, Snoopy, it's our wedding.

339
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,559
Flaming Lips do it. Have you heard...
I can speak to her.

340
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,756
You don't really need to speak to her.

341
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,276
I'll have to calm this one down,
she thinks you're taking the piss.

342
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,954
No, mate, it's just the monkey tipped it over.

343
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,919
- Soon as I said the monkey with the wings...
- I don't know if it was the monkey.

344
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,470
I saw her face, it dropped.
If you don't want a monkey, don't have it.

345
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,279
It wasn't an integral part.
I could be a wicked witch.

346
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,829
<i>- I am anxious.</i>
<i>- We both are. Today is a big day,</i>

347
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,708
<i>we've got the wedding planners coming in,</i>
<i>and those... lovely fellas</i>

348
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,633
<i>hopefully will have come up</i>
<i>with something exciting,</i>

349
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,756
<i>because we've not heard much.</i>

350
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,957
<i>No, not much.</i>
<i>And we gave them a lot of information.</i>

351
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,555
<i>- We're hoping they'll come back...</i>
<i>- With something concrete.</i>

352
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,474
- Sorry we're so late.
- That's OK, let's start. Let's waste no time.

353
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,836
Look, shall we just show you?
We've got it in our heads.

354
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,559
- Opening of your ceremony.
- Brilliant.

355
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,996
- Where do you want us?
- If you just go over there.

356
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,356
- Imagine you're the congregation and we're...
- Right.

357
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,795
And we're sort of looking that way.

358
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,429
- What?
- Let's give them a chance. You never know.

359
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,310
The parade of the ball boys.

360
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,833
On they come!

361
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,997
Go!

362
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,233
Go!

363
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,513
Oof!

364
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,673
And then,
from the back come your gigantic balls.

365
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,349
- All the way down, on the tramlines, hm?
- Right.

366
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,477
And then you perform your vows.
Then you're married.

367
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,075
And that's the start. What do you think?

368
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,030
That's not... We need
to speak to someone professional.

369
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,395
I mean, you move beautifully, both of you,

370
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,189
but we need someone who knows
what they're doing. Properly.

371
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,159
- Well...
- With, um, ball boys and ball girls, don't we?

372
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,992
- Yeah.
- So a choreographer.

373
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,878
We think that the choreographer, really,

374
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,239
should be the remit
of the MGM wedding couple.

375
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,039
We can't have the choreographer
cos they've got one?

376
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,318
Well, because their dance
is sort of key, central to their...

377
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,551
- It's central to ours.
- I've worked a lot on it.

378
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,518
Right before you guys came in,
I was working on the moves.

379
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,116
- She does dancing.
- I saw that. I thought you'd injured yourself.

380
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,158
Yeah, whatever, whatever. We need a...

381
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,958
We asked for...

382
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,234
Ahem!

383
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,517
- The problem...
- Oh, for fuck's sake, it's Jesus.

384
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,750
Can you get rid of him? Get rid of him.

385
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,353
Um...

386
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,398
I have to explain something.
We must win this competition.

387
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,313
There's no question of if, but or maybe,
we have to win it.

388
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,472
We are in severe financial...
What are you doing?

389
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,676
- I invited him along.
- Can you go away?

390
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,876
- No, I invited him here.
- I want him to go.

391
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,713
- I want him to stay!
- I want him to go!

392
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,633
Listen, speak nice to her.
She's going to be your wife...

393
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,517
No, can you go?

394
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,912
- What's it like being short? Do you like it?
- Josef, stop being rude all the time!

395
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,357
What's the weather like down there?
What's the Spanish for "Go away, you fairy"?

396
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,069
- Josef, stop it.
- You have to say "I love you" to her. Not...

397
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,515
I'm sorry? What do you have to say to her?

398
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,636
- Don't touch me.
- I'm not touching you.

399
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,154
- Stop it!
- I'm not touching you.

400
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,515
- Stop it!
- Josef!

401
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,397
No, no!

402
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,471
No, no, no!

403
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,753
Now, listen! Listen, please, please.

404
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,150
- Please, please, please listen. Please.
- Get off me...

405
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,231
Please, now listen to me.

406
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,552
You do not have an education from a boy's
boarding school in the north of England

407
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,837
and be the only gay boy,
and not know how to handle yourself.

408
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,595
So if you move again, I'm going
to break your arm. Do you understand?

409
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,830
He doesn't deserve you.

410
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,230
He'll be fine.
He just... he just needs to run it off.

411
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,154
- Sorry.
- That's fine. It's fine. So, from the top.

412
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,549
I think we should just...

413
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,278
No!

414
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,635
No, no, no, no!

415
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,280
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

416
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,319
You stop it, you stop it!
And you stop it, just stop it!

417
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,109
It's ridiculous! It's just stupid!

418
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,952
I come here for this?

419
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,555
I was appalled by that, and shocked.

420
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,428
It was... It was terrifying.
It was a terrifying experience.

421
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,115
It's in my top ten terrifying experiences.

422
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,955
It's just not what we're used to.
It's not the world we work in, really.

423
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:04,955
But, you know, we showed them a few things,
and we'll come back and show them more.

424
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,110
You showed them some things.

425
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,272
You stood up for me,
and you stood up for yourself.

426
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,989
It was amazing. It was wonderful, Archie.

427
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,789
It was really wonderful, you do know that?
I'm so proud of you.

428
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,269
Come on, let's go.
We'll see you later. Bye.

429
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,351
Bye.

430
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,635
- People don't like me, do they?
- Josef, people like you.

431
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,517
- Who?
- I like you.

432
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,079
- You don't count.
- Why not?

433
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,516
Well, you do count,
but you don't count in people who like me.

434
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,909
- Why not?
- Because you obviously like me.

435
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,310
Well, do you like me? I don't like me.

436
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,714
Maybe that's the real problem.

437
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,870
- Thank you, Dr. Freud.
- I'm just saying.

438
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,077
I have a lot more experience.
I mean, I went to counseling.

439
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,355
I'm not going to counseling.
Don't start.

440
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,151
I'm just saying if you'd stayed a bit longer,
we'd have answered some of these questions.

441
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,438
We're gonna get you in a positive space
right now. I don't feel that you are.

442
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,511
Know what we've got?

443
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,712
You want to hold that for a while?
Hold it.

444
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,789
Huh?

445
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,871
That's what we've got. We've got...

446
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,633
I won this ten years ago.

447
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,234
Hold this. Come on, hold it.

448
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,550
Look at me. Hnngh! Come on.

449
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,710
Come on, Josef, gimme that!

450
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,552
That's it!

451
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,557
- Hello, there!
- Gregory, how you doing? All right?

452
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,029
- Hello, Sam, how are you?
- Hi, hi.

453
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,033
- This is Jen, my sister.
- Oh, hello. Nice to meet you.

454
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,749
So if you two lovebirds
would like to flutter down with me.

455
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,798
- Do you want to come as well?
- Jen's coming as well.

456
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,316
Jen's really interested.
Jen's a professional choreographer...

457
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,551
- Professional dancer and choreographer.
- A choreographer?

458
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,030
She'd like to...
She's going to be choreographing the show.

459
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,839
- Oh.
- I've got loads of ideas, cos I've done loads.

460
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:02,038
You know, I've been dancing for 12 years,
so I've got loads of ideas worked out.

461
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,635
We're sorry about the other lady,
but Jen really wants to do it.

462
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,555
Well, we have the best dance choreographer
in the country. You do realize that?

463
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,871
I was just explaining...
Well, we were just explaining,

464
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,157
- I'm actually a professional choreographer.
- Oh, really?

465
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,438
- So we've kind of come up with a few ideas.
- Yeah.

466
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,640
And what we're kind of thinking is
we've kind of got it wrapped up, really.

467
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,711
I mean, I can show you a few...

468
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,713
I'm not quite sure what the ideas are
originally. I'm a bit new to this.

469
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,439
- Well, shall I...
- Can you explain what it is?

470
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,353
Cos I don't know that it is all wrapped up yet.

471
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,753
It's like, the theme that we've gone after,
right, is a kind of '30s and '40s musical.

472
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,071
- Right. Fred Astaire and all that.
- Exactly. Exactly.

473
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,312
- Who's the water woman?
- Oh, it's sort of like an Esther Williams style.

474
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,278
Oh, right, yes.
With hundreds of girls, and all of that.

475
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,351
Obviously a smaller version of that.

476
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,513
I mean, it's like... You know.
I just might as well hop up.

477
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,830
- Jen's worked some moves out.
- Right.

478
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,480
- Two rows of girls...
- Is she allowed on the stage?

479
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,949
...Busby Berkeley, all the tinfoil dresses.

480
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,032
And then it's like out,
the next girl out, the next girl out.

481
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,032
On the other side,
simultaneously, all at the same time,

482
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,918
out, next girl, out, next girl, out.

483
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,639
- Jen...
- And then, Matt and Sam can sink down,

484
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,712
and you know like
the dream ballet in <i>Oklahoma!</i>

485
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,031
Dream Laurey comes out,
me, same costume, wig.

486
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,111
- So I'm Sam.
- Jen...

487
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,354
You know, it just gives you an idea.
we do stuff like it on the ships all the time.

488
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,991
If she'd like to do it, then that's fine.
You don't need me.

489
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,638
- She is not...
- Do you like...

490
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,756
What do you think about the dream ballet?

491
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,391
Cos Sam, you know, physical dyslexia,
and that, she's going to be all nervous.

492
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,311
- What?
- Sorry?

493
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,915
- Well, Sam's got physical dyslexia.
- What's that?

494
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,275
Well, she's, like, clumsy.

495
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,518
- Clumsy? She can't dance?
- No, of course she can dance.

496
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,718
We did a lot of dancing as kids.
I mean, I did a lot of dancing.

497
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,237
I think it's great that we've got Jen here
cos she can play a really strong role in this,

498
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:13,668
but I really feel that we've got Jenny here,
who is an expert in choreography,

499
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,753
as opposed to a dancer,
and we should be using her like we said.

500
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,069
She's done cruise ships for years.

501
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,436
- Cruise ships, exactly.
- Who works out all the dances? She does.

502
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,988
- Right...
- Who's a professional dancer? She is.

503
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,390
- And this choreographer's not?
- All she wants to do

504
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,189
is help her sister on her wedding day.
Something wrong with that?

505
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,034
But this isn’t just an ordinary wedding.
We've entered a competition.

506
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,032
- We've got to abide by the rules.
- It's her wedding day.

507
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,795
Yeah, and it's my wedding day as well.
It's my important day as well.

508
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,235
I'll be your sister.
Have you thought of that?

509
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,833
Jesus, every night.

510
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,549
I know you're stressed and tired
and you've been getting up really...

511
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,794
You know, I know you're working hard,
and I... and I'm totally amazed...

512
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,839
I'm about to get married in a competition.
Of course I'm stressed.

513
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:06,038
But you're being so lovely, and you're
really putting your heart and soul into it.

514
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,157
- Yeah, for you.
- And I know that. But they don't know that.

515
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,993
Yeah, but they should know it.
Why don't they know it?

516
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,877
Yeah, because they've not met...

517
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,509
They've not met me? I've lived with
your flippin' mum for nine months.

518
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,591
- They will see it, they will.
- Christ!

519
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:24,879
All I'm saying is that you need to go
and be a bit... Do a bit of diplomacy.

520
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,871
- Oh, yeah, I will.
- You know.

521
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,592
But I love you and I'm completely with you
and I'm totally, day by day,

522
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:37,879
I'm just amazed at how wonderful you are.

523
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,552
And, and...

524
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,438
I'm so pleased to be marrying you.

525
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,957
<i>I come down the aisle,</i>
<i>you're waiting at the altar,</i>

526
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,352
<i>in your top hat and tails, with Snoopy,</i>
<i>you know, doing the sway, whatever.</i>

527
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,798
<i>I come down, you know, shuffling down</i>
<i>the aisle, whatever. In time, hopefully.</i>

528
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,996
<i>And then meet you at the altar.</i>

529
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,790
<i>The other question that I'm worried about</i>
<i>as well is who's going to take me down there?</i>

530
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,189
What about your dad?

531
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,840
I don't... I...

532
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,390
You know, I'm not sure
if he's gonna be there, to be honest.

533
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,914
At the moment
it doesn't look like he'll be there.

534
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,036
- Why?
- Well, because he's obviously...

535
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,430
- I haven't invited him, Mum hasn't...
- Do you not want him...

536
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:35,719
I'd like him to be there,
but obviously I'm not in a position to...

537
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,792
To invite your dad to your wedding?

538
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,917
I'm not in a position to...

539
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,112
I'm not in a position to... to do that.

540
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,033
You do want him there, don't you?

541
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,712
All right, your dad being at your wedding
is more important than anything else.

542
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,954
Or that your family being at your wedding
is more important than getting the song right.

543
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,319
I think your mum's going to have
to lump it for four hours of her life.

544
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,871
Feel this bit. That's it. Out.

545
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,868
And run to each other, and round.

546
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,554
And turn out.

547
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,437
And back. Hold his face.

548
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,676
- Not quite like that.
- Should I hold...

549
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,558
Where's Snoopy's bit?

550
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,029
Where's... We haven't done any of the music.

551
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,714
It's not all, it can't be this, surely, you know?

552
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,950
Cos we've got a thing. La, la.

553
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,110
Not that, it's bigger.

554
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,477
Snoop...

555
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,988
I can do that bit. I can do the twiddly bit.

556
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,038
That's, er, not good. But...

557
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,430
That, I mean, I thought that could be the big...

558
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,919
That's... great.

559
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,232
"Steel III", it's called. "Steel III."
Still ill, "Steel III". There's lots...

560
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,517
- But what's it got to do with the wedding?
- Shining.

561
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,639
Is that what you think I am?
I'm a girl on the cover of a porno magazine?

562
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,234
With a steel tongue?
Is that what you're saying?

563
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,470
No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying, er...

564
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,916
You're saying it's nomothetic?
Yeah, yeah, good idea.

565
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,673
- It makes me sick.
- Our relationship makes you sick?

566
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,159
- No, no.
- Well, Snoopy,

567
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,550
if you sing that song at our wedding,
that's what it sounds like.

568
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,634
I'm not. I'm saying everyone else's
relationship's normal, nomothetic. This is...

569
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:18,157
- There is no nomothetic!
- What does pedantic mean? That's the...

570
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,712
Snoopy, that's an interesting question,
but it's not the time to work it out here.

571
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,432
- Snoopy can do the lyrics...
- We're going to have...

572
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,513
Snoopy has a vital part to play in this
wedding, there's no doubt about that.

573
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,957
He is Matt's best friend and he's
musically talented, and he's going to be there.

574
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,110
But this will be their dream wedding,

575
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,670
and I am prepared to kill or maim
for them to have that wedding.

576
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,113
Do you understand me?

577
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,990
- Out you come, my honey.
- Bless, look at that.

578
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:10,437
Oh, she's looking a bit ragged, actually.
She didn't quite make the journey.

579
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,878
Now, which way are we round? We're all
moving around now, it's like Dunsinane.

580
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,554
I like the idea.
Kind of <i>Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>

581
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,269
That kind of thing. Fairies,
<i>Midsummer Night's Dream.</i> They arrive...

582
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,918
- Where's the couple?
- There.

583
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,275
I think they're hiding. They're hiding.

584
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,636
- Well, they're not going to be naked.
- Well, this is the problem.

585
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,392
It's tricky convincing them.

586
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,393
I'm not interested in convincing them.
This is what we need for our front cover.

587
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,357
- We can't have nude people.
- Vivien.

588
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,149
They're not going to be on the front cover
cos they're not gonna win.

589
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,834
- I think we all know that.
- Well, they may do.

590
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,399
Well, they may not.

591
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,119
Don't write them off
cos they've got no clothes on.

592
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,273
What about having a little bush,
if you'll pardon the language,

593
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,476
a bush area that covers the...

594
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,792
- Well, we had thought...
- A bush? How elegant is that going to be?

595
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,078
Well, if it's... If the topiary is done properly,
I think it could be rather lovely.

596
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:08,439
- Well, they're wearing...
- I gave you an agenda. Agenda is: no nudes.

597
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,396
To begin with, the dance is very formal.

598
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,996
Then, more country.

599
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,594
Suddenly, bright lights.

600
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,433
What's that rumble?
The rumble of something. What?

601
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,671
What it is is the arrival of your camper van.

602
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,115
And inside, you...

603
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,715
are the queen of the fairies.

604
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,318
Me, Oberon-like, as the king of the fairies,
emerge from the camper van.

605
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,039
The green man guides them, comforts them.

606
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:55,636
And he is, of course,
our green man/registrar.

607
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,711
And you're married.

608
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,157
Well, I just think that completely sucks.
I mean, that whole thing is rubbish.

609
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,915
I mean, this is our wedding.
We can't be prancing around like berks.

610
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,198
We have a little problem here
that I think we ought to share with you.

611
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,273
That is that our brief, if you like,

612
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,558
is that your naturist wedding
must not be naked.

613
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,712
And that's come right from the top.

614
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,590
I really have to apologize.
I chose these people.

615
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,595
And it was after lunch, they were the best of
a bad lot, I'd had a couple of glasses of wine,

616
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,513
- and I think I've made an error of judgment.
- All right.

617
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,068
OK, we just need
to deal with it now, yeah? OK.

618
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,277
- We just need to get them in a dress.
- We do. We absolutely do.

619
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,000
- Lovely to see you.
- Come on in.

620
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,277
This gentleman is James Thursk.
He's our lawyer.

621
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,353
And he sorts things out. I believe
we've got some sorting out to do today.

622
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,671
Yeah. Well, er, we've been talking,

623
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,673
and the problem is that we were asked
for an idea for an original wedding,

624
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,955
and our idea was a naturist wedding,

625
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:10,991
and we found out recently that this is going
to be a naturist wedding featuring no nudity.

626
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,718
Mr. Thursk.

627
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,635
You can't really expect anyone to put naked
people on the cover of a magazine if they win.

628
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,315
- I'm talking about our wedding.
- Don't put us on the cover.

629
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:26,235
And as naturists, we know that you can't be
a bit naked. You're either naked or you're not.

630
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,959
You're not naked now,
you seem comfortable enough.

631
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,191
Is that some kind of challenge?
All right, fine.

632
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,872
- I don't think...
- Michael.

633
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,952
I hardly think it's appropriate...

634
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,237
- This isn't going to help.
- You're naked or you're not.

635
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,915
Stop it there, please.
We're trying to have a civilized discussion.

636
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,798
I'm having a civilized discussion.

637
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,714
I can still have a civilized
discussion whether I'm dressed or not.

638
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,189
He's becoming impossible to live with.

639
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,999
I'm going to stay here
until we write a new contract

640
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,436
that says that we can have the wedding
that you said that we can have.

641
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,513
I've got to tell you now,
that's just not going to happen.

642
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:08,799
We cannot put out a magazine with people
in it naked. I'm sorry, we simply cannot do it.

643
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,030
- OK. Well, uh...
- That is the end of it.

644
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:16,319
- Yeah, I guess that is the end of it.
- What we do after that, Mr. Collier...

645
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,436
Joanna, maybe if you just
wore a wedding dress...

646
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,829
I'm not even sure that I want to get married.

647
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,037
This is not what I dreamt of
since I was a little girl.

648
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,237
It is not becoming
what I wanted for a wedding.

649
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,356
He sleeps in the kitchen at the moment.

650
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,273
What if you dressed yourself up
to allure him?

651
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:42,638
Maybe you've just been naked too much.
Maybe you've become immune to each other.

652
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,757
Being so naked the whole time,
you've got used to your bodies.

653
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,149
There's no sort of magic. James?

654
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,756
Yes. There's something
very romantic about a wedding dress.

655
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:58,551
Well, if I can just start by simply explaining
why we're here and what it's all about.

656
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,919
We're here today to talk about
what it means to actually be getting married.

657
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,991
There's not really much to talk about.

658
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,437
I mean, you know, I felt that what we were
going to do was have a naturist wedding,

659
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:15,958
and that would involve people
acting like naturists, aka being naked.

660
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,110
- It's AKA, not aka.
- And...

661
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:24,116
Apparently not everybody feels the same way.
Including the person I was hoping to marry.

662
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:29,911
I have expressed a... Not just a
made-up problem, but a real issue with me,

663
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,231
is that being naked in front
of non-naturists is not as easy.

664
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,834
I keep saying,
nobody's going to laugh.

665
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,118
Your body is the most eloquent expression
of how beautiful you are.

666
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,760
Get it into your thick head
how much I respect you.

667
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,753
If we take "thick" out for the moment,
there were some very nice words there.

668
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:50,628
- Right.
- We can pop one out and put another one in.

669
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,191
- Let's take "thick" out then.
- Let's take "thick" out. Good. Good.

670
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:01,276
Could you, could you... Are you ready
to shuffle up a bit yet on the settee?

671
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,870
Well done. Lovely. OK.

672
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,357
The wedding planners
are not giving us the same service.

673
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,830
They get a choreographer.
We're not allowed a choreographer.

674
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,478
- Next.
- Next point.

675
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,997
Well, she had a makeover at the wedding fair
before we made a fuss and I got Isabelle one.

676
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,277
- You did make a fuss.
- They're getting resources that we are not.

677
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:33,480
- They're getting... Is it rigged?
- Oh, please! Is it rigged? I mean...

678
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,120
- Just tell us, because we...
- Absolutely not.

679
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,909
Well, it doesn't seem like that
from where we're sitting.

680
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,551
I'm the chair of the judging panel,
I've got the casting vote. It will not be fixed.

681
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,598
- You have the casting vote?
- Yes.

682
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:55,550
So what are you, uh, what do you w...
What are you looking for?

683
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,070
So, Isabelle. Let's have a look at your nose.

684
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,277
- Shall I?
- Yes, please. Can you look in the mirror?

685
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,998
- OK. So...
- I love that nose.

686
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,516
What I see in your nose
is that the dorsum here,

687
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,275
the bridge, is a little bit too wide,
and too flat. OK?

688
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:15,797
The nose a little bit too short,
and is pointing up too much.

689
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:20,431
And when I look at you,
I see inside your nostrils.

690
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,590
And I personally don't like that.

691
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,993
Yeah? OK.

692
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:42,556
Have to check what that country's called.
I don't think it's that.

693
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:28,636
- That's really all I've got at the moment.
- I just think that's beautiful.

694
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,914
Here we go. So, voilà.

695
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,278
That's your basic set, as it were.

696
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,510
- Er, your wedding area.
- Dark, innit?

697
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,239
It'll be lit. Obviously, it's not just this dark.

698
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,995
Here, it's peopled with,
as you described to us before,

699
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:55,436
about maybe a little canopy of people.

700
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,149
- I don't know what you think...
- It just looks so dark, I don't like it.

701
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,754
- But it'll be lit.
- Is the floor going to be black?

702
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:05,549
- I'm saying, it'll be lit.
- You don't want black walls and a black floor.

703
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,631
These are star lights all around here.

704
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,709
- Do you?
- No.

705
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,189
- Star lights, like little stars.
- I don't care.

706
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,114
That's a black floor, and it's not right
for a wedding. That's my opinion.

707
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,079
It makes it easier for you
to stand out in whatever, in your white,

708
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,310
or what I thought was using a color.

709
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,278
I just don't like the sound of it.
Well, carry on.

710
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,033
- Thank you. Cheers. Carry on.
- I don't like it at all.

711
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,269
- Matt.
- What if...

712
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,716
Few flowers or something.
Looks like a morgue.

713
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,634
- Flowers don't exist in this theme.
- Yeah.

714
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,711
Busby Berkeley was not full of flowers.

715
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:42,157
- What are you doing?
- It's about angles. Geometrics. Art Deco.

716
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,708
Shapes, bodies of...
She's nodding. She knows.

717
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,597
What are the lights for?

718
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,752
The great thing about the spotlights
is we'll just see you,

719
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,355
- not people hanging around.
- What's the point in having people then?

720
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,592
Shut the fuck up! Seriously. Shut the fuck up.

721
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,989
- Matt, excuse me.
- Excuse nothing.

722
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,470
- I don't want language like that.
- No, we had this out yesterday.

723
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:07,235
- You shut up.
- I beg your pardon! Goodness me!

724
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:11,359
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- We're losing the wedding planners now.

725
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,035
- It's gone pear-shaped.
- It's not <i>gone</i> pear-shaped. You put it...

726
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:18,749
- Your fault. Not mine. Not Sam's. Not Jen's.
- You put it pear-shaped.

727
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,310
You shouting like as though
you're on a barrow in a market.

728
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,631
If you want to come and see us,
you two, getting married, do.

729
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:29,315
But we don't need your sister
and your mother, it is not their wedding,

730
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,472
- and we won't do it.
- Sort your sister out. You sort her out.

731
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,950
- Can you leave my house, please?
- It would be an absolute joy.

732
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,237
This green is giving me a headache.
Speaking of headaches...

733
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,959
Stop commenting on my house.

734
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:45,635
Oh, my godfathers, I tell you what.
I've had it with you.

735
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,915
I've had enough. I've had enough.

736
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,275
- Right. OK. Take care.
- Thank you.

737
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:55,229
- You need that house, so call us.
- I don't want to talk to her again.

738
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,471
That makes two of us. Thanks a lot.

739
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,677
Thanks for coming over. Safe journey.

740
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,274
Well, that was a waste of time.
That's all we need.

741
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:09,832
I'm only trying to help. I tell you what, you
might as well pack your fucking bags and go,

742
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,718
cos you've really upset me this time,
I tell you what.

743
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,759
You won't apologize and repair it this time.
Bugger off.

744
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,874
<i>Matt's gone.</i>
<i>I don't know where he is.</i>

745
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,509
He could be lying on a park bench
somewhere. He's gone because of you.

746
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,477
Cos of the way you behaved yesterday.

747
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,836
Don't say you're worrying about him.
Not after the way he behaved.

748
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,913
Shouting at your sister, shouting at me,
shouting in front of you.

749
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,275
Language like that? No.

750
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,999
He's shouting because
he can't stand it any more.

751
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,911
And I can't stand it any more.

752
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,231
Stand what any more, Sam?
Stand me and Mum trying to help?

753
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:51,189
Me coming back off a cruise, I'll do the
choreography, be in a dream ballet sequence.

754
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,750
I was so pleased when I heard
you were coming back from the cruise.

755
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:59,755
I was so excited to see you. And then
you come back and you just try and take over.

756
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,877
It's like you don't trust
that I can do it on my own.

757
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,988
I've had to sit there and watch you and
clap you, with half a flamingo on your head,

758
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,993
Going, "Oh, look at Jen, look at Jen."
And it's my turn now.

759
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:15,629
I want to have a chance. I want to have
a chance. I want it to be me and Matt.

760
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:19,952
Me and Matt getting married, loving each
other. Getting married in that spotlight.

761
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:25,114
Give me one day, just one chance,
to have my day, my wedding day,

762
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,990
and I want you to be there loving me,
and supporting me.

763
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,356
Not making me feel like some idiot.

764
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,309
Hello.

765
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,999
Morning, Matt. Are you well?

766
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,991
Cheers. Thanks a lot.

767
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,629
You're not the first person to turn up here
before a wedding, freaking out.

768
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:21,952
No. You've just got to accept
the fact that it's a stressful time,

769
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:27,194
take some time out and look after yourself
and look after her, and don't get so wound up.

770
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,635
You need a bit of me time.
That's what you need.

771
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,439
It's very difficult. There's so much pressure.

772
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:37,196
Particularly with this...

773
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,394
What is that?

774
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,279
Jesus Christ! What are you...
What are you doing?

775
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,920
Stop it. St...

776
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,514
Sorry, I'd better go and...

777
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:00,516
It's Julie. Julie Andrews.

778
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,319
Fly, my Romeo, fly.

779
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,990
He's coming down, he's coming down.

780
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,433
Oh!

781
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,394
- Archie, look!
- Aw...

782
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,550
My lovebirds.

783
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,871
That's beautiful.

784
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,751
Oh, Archie.

785
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,680
Just put something on, please.

786
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,877
I'm not gonna get dressed
just because your mother's coming.

787
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,349
- I'll have to go somewhere else.
- It's our room.

788
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,352
When I go to her house,
then I'll put some clothes on.

789
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,635
- Tubsy, darling.
- Mummy, hello.

790
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,235
- How are you, sweetheart?
- Good, thank you. How are you?

791
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,710
I'm fine. What have they done to you, then?
Where have they put you?

792
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,155
- Oh, it's quite nice.
- It is nice.

793
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,438
Sweetheart, you're looking thinner.
Well done, that's excellent.

794
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:25,150
Right. Well, I've had a long day,
so it's lovely to be here.

795
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,708
There you are, sweetie.

796
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,028
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

797
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:35,468
Mrs. Roberts. Well, I suppose now
I should call you Mum, really, shouldn't I?

798
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,676
- Erm...
- Pleasant trip?

799
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,638
Oh, my God.

800
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,711
Look at them.

801
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,837
- That is ridiculous.
- We're fucked.

802
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,832
That is absolutely ridiculous.

803
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,273
'Ere, move over.
I'm almost on these chairs here.

804
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,316
You ready, Mum?

805
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:13,832
See, I don't know where Matt's coming from.
Is that him? Is that us, Jenny? Is this us?

806
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,516
- Five, six, seven, eight, go.
- Go.

807
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,119
Lower the arm.

808
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,550
- God.
- What's he doing here?

809
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,154
Oh, no, I don't believe...

810
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:41,597
How come he knew about it? Who's been
talking to him, that's what I want to know.

811
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:45,878
- Well, Matt obviously knew about it.
- I could have been warned.

812
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,397
You all right? Don't get upset, Mum, don't
get upset, cos then it's like he's winning.

813
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,199
All right, Dave?

814
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,794
You never said.

815
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:59,270
I wasn't sure if he was gonna come,
but I'm glad. Shall we get on?

816
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:03,592
Well, it would have been nice if you could
have told me your dad was going to be here.

817
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,796
- Sorry.
- Is he going to be dancing?

818
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,598
- Yeah.
- No.

819
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,355
Five, six, seven, eight.
Up! Down! Up! Down!

820
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,556
- Up, two, three...
- Go!

821
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:17,269
One, two, three, four!

822
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,511
And run. Good, very good. Perfect.

823
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:25,037
Five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

824
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,509
- One, two...
- I'm sorry, but...

825
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,716
- Keep going!
- One, two...

826
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,759
- He's too close to me.
- Up, two, three, four. And up...

827
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:38,789
- For God's sake, Dave, do me a favor.
...and over, and over.

828
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,395
- I'm trying my best.
- How can anyone be so insensitive?

829
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,517
- You punch me in the back of the head.
- I'm not Fred Astaire.

830
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,636
- Pushing me.
- I'm not Ginger Rogers.

831
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:51,190
And if you're not pushing me,
I can feel you making me lose me balance.

832
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,352
Chris, there's only a little bit of room.
We've all got to...

833
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:59,389
All right. What I'm saying is, he's standing
right next to me, bish, bash, bosh.

834
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,233
- It's very hard.
- I'm doing my best.

835
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:06,916
- We've all got to try...
- If you were a bit more sensitive.

836
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,070
And...

837
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,277
- Hi.
- Hi, guys.

838
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,636
What's happened?
What's happened to your face?

839
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,554
The nose job. The nose job.
This is just protecting it.

840
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,631
- It's next week!
- How long's it on for?

841
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,518
- It's gonna be fine.
- Don't worry about the timing.

842
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:34,276
We're not worried about this any more.
I'm only worried because I had to pay for it.

843
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,828
Right. Cliff Richard?

844
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,309
- Very possibly.
- What do you mean, possibly?

845
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,551
He's out of the country,
but he said if he can get back, he will,

846
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:46,110
and if not he's got somebody he'll send
who is more like him than he is.

847
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,270
- So that's...
- Big ball? The big ball?

848
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,476
- We've got you a big ball.
- Where is it?

849
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,471
- It's arriving on the day.
- On the day?

850
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:56,189
- It's £1,000 a day.
- How many, erm, how many ball boys?

851
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,919
- Six.
- Or possibly even eight.

852
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,797
Choreographer?

853
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,838
We're still talking to her,
we're still talking to her.

854
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,639
It's just that we've got so many weddings...

855
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,632
If we can get a shape, right?

856
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:12,792
We haven't really got the budget
for a choreographer, but...

857
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:17,192
Listen to me. If we can get a shape to it,
on the day we can get her in, hopefully,

858
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,909
we're talking to her, we can get her in,
and she can tidy it up at the end.

859
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,355
She's busy with 42 dancers
in the other wedding.

860
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,352
She is the choreographer,
and the choreographer...

861
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,078
- Choreographs.
- Dance pieces.

862
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,798
And provides ideas.

863
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,438
- Yes, but...
- Provide ideas.

864
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,353
No, no, that's what couples do
who want to get married.

865
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,318
- We have given our ideas!
- Where have your ideas been?

866
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,914
- We gave you ideas.
- We wanted ball boys,

867
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,356
we wanted you to arrive at a net,
we wanted you in Edwardian clothes,

868
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,228
- and everything was thrown out.
- No, you didn't. When have... What...

869
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,993
We came to you at your club and said:

870
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,992
"Entrance of ball boys
to prepare your arena for you."

871
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:56,550
It's not our fault that you don't
have enough friends to bring along

872
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,437
who can do these things for you.

873
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,511
- Fuck you!
- Oh, no, please...

874
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,160
- No, we have friends!
- Well, where are they?

875
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,913
Fuck off about the friends.
This is not about friends.

876
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,312
- Of course it is. On the day, we need people...
- They can't make it.

877
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,039
Her family are from Canada.
Know how far away that is?

878
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:17,989
We can't afford it cos we've
had to spend all our money on her nose.

879
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,111
Thanks very much.

880
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:30,795
Oh, Arch, come on, don't be silly.
Come on, don't be silly.

881
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,998
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, come on. It's not your fault.

882
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:38,231
I don't like him shouting...

883
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,754
Oh, come here. Come here.

884
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:44,196
You silly sausage. Silly sausage.

885
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,555
It's not your fault though.

886
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:55,839
Come on, my big bear.
Don't be silly. Come on.

887
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,911
Don't be silly.

888
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:05,989
Oh, they're coming back.
Come on, don't let them see you like this.

889
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,753
Why not?
They just think I'm a stupid puff anyway.

890
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:12,150
Don't be stupid.
I'm the puff, you're the straight man.

891
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,231
Don't be silly.

892
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,509
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK now.

893
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:32,396
I just wonder how long
before she gets sick of me, really.

894
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,391
Before she, um...

895
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:41,712
You know. Especially if we don't win the
competition, I've got nothing to offer her.

896
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:45,236
I'm at the end of my tennis career, and...

897
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:48,232
- OK.
...I've got no money,

898
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:52,438
and I don't know whether,
you know, whether in a year's time

899
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:55,318
she'll still want to be married,

900
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:59,916
you know, if I haven't
provided anything good for her,

901
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,151
or, you know,
if I'm not winning any tennis matches.

902
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:07,995
They're under huge pressure,
these, you know, these people,

903
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:12,073
to sort of have the perfect wedding,
and they...

904
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:16,516
So it's natural that they should
take that out on us a bit, I suppose.

905
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:22,197
You know, if we don't like it,
then we wouldn't be doing it, would we?

906
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,229
- You're tired, aren't you?
- Sorry?

907
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:31,713
- You're just tired. He's just tired.
- No, I'm not tired. I'm fine.

908
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:36,669
Tell Mr. Rusedski to ring me,
I won't ring again.

909
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:40,275
The wedding's really soon.
He wanted to come. OK?

910
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:44,319
Josef Worrell, you have my number.
Thank you.

911
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,231
Do you like it?

912
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,229
Yeah.

913
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:06,118
- You don't.
- I do.

914
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,668
Why are you crying? Don't cry.

915
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,957
- It's good?
- No, I do, I like it. Don't cry.

916
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,758
It's OK. I like it. I love it.

917
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,114
- You do?
- Yeah.

918
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,431
- It's just a bit of a shock.
- Do you want to see it from the side?

919
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:20,511
- OK.
- OK.

920
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,509
Hey. You look gorgeous.

921
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,114
- All right?
- All right? I'm tremendous.

922
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,158
Terribly exciting, isn't it?

923
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,389
How can that nose go on a front cover?

924
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,950
I didn't say it specifically,
but I implied "change it for the better".

925
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,359
Well, it wasn't, was it?

926
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,556
- It's ever so subtle.
- I know.

927
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,631
- It's out here.
- I know.

928
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:56,359
It looks like it's been broken and then reset.

929
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:59,000
Is that the mother over there?

930
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:04,200
- She's not going to be naked, is she?
- No.

931
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,838
No one wants to see that.

932
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,354
- Who's that?
- That's her sister.

933
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,192
Sister of who?

934
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,635
- Really?
- Yeah.

935
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:16,474
- Are you insisting that they wear clothes?
- I think it would be better.

936
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:20,872
I too. I couldn't agree with you more.
Now let's just stop the silly stuff, shall we?

937
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,354
Thanks.

938
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,954
"Looking at the view"?
I've heard that one before.

939
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,190
- Mum!
- I weren't born yesterday.

940
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,273
Do you think Jen would be that cheap
to go upstairs with a stranger and have sex?

941
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:36,238
- Mum, excuse me, we was talking.
- I mean, she's...

942
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,276
This is my little girl here.

943
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:42,876
I can assure you, sir,
that nothing happened... Vivien? Vivien?

944
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:47,478
- Er, so, here's to a wonderful day.
- Here's to <i>Confetti.</i>

945
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,551
Cheers!

946
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,278
Oh, look, look.
Somebody's set this right-handed.

947
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,911
No, but it's good. It's good.

948
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,788
It's lovely, it's lovely.
It's just detail, it's just detail.

949
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,348
- Start getting ready now.
- I am getting ready.

950
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,192
- All right.
- Look, what's this?

951
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:34,751
I know. They need to come out,
you need to be... Go see Marella now.

952
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,790
- Is everybody all right?
- Yeah.

953
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:45,351
- OK, I think a few people have disappeared.
- They've just gone to the loo.

954
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,910
Please just make it a loo run
and nothing else. All right?

955
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,959
- You look absolutely fabulous. Smashing.
- Thank you.

956
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,837
- So do you.
- Thank you very much.

957
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:59,391
Can't say I hope you win, cos I don't.
But anyway, good luck. Hope it goes well.

958
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:02,040
- Yeah, I hope yours goes well. Really do.
- Thanks.

959
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,156
Is everything all right? No panic?

960
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,276
- No. It's lovely.
- Is it?

961
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,954
- I'm worried...
- What are you talking about?

962
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:12,350
- I just don't know if I can do it, I mean...
- Hey, hey, no, no, no.

963
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:15,830
- Just cos of the singing...
- You'll be fine, darling.

964
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,434
Sam, listen to me. Listen to me. Breathe.

965
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:21,193
- Your singing is...
- I think I'm going to be sick.

966
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,748
- Sam, do you want me to come?
- I feel sick.

967
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:27,276
- Sam?
- Keep her hair away from her face.

968
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,920
- OK.
- Otherwise you get sick on the hair.

969
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,390
If it's something different,
something you like, and you think:

970
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:38,554
"Well, I haven't seen this before." That's not...
Regardless of whether you like it or not.

971
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:42,030
If you hate it, step back and say,
"Original, but I didn't like it."

972
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:49,517
Just popped by to say, on behalf of <i>Confetti</i>
magazine, the best of British. All right?

973
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:53,878
- Thanks.
- And I think you've got a very strong chance.

974
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:56,633
- Thank you. That's very nice.
- Smashing.

975
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:00,076
lf, erm... Yes, if you keep your clothes on.

976
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,151
See you later.

977
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,948
What I'm about to say now
is not meant as a criticism, I swear to you.

978
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,713
But you know you're sort of
painted brown, some of...

979
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:14,270
It's just, like, there's a line,
and I don't know if...

980
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,999
If you want to change it...
maybe you didn't notice it.

981
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:20,675
But I know you're a perfectionist,
I thought you might want to change it.

982
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:24,548
- Cos you're a perfectionist...
- What do you mean?

983
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,950
- I've fake tanned it, I've just, like, done it...
- I know, but...

984
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:32,431
Yeah, but you don't get brown palms when
you sunbathe. You don't sunbathe like that.

985
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,988
But not everyone
looks like Biffo the Bear.

986
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:38,436
Cos I mean, like, there's a sort of brown,
and there's a white...

987
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:40,590
We have to win. We have to win.

988
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:44,275
So we will win. We will win. Come on, Josef.

989
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,874
Come on. Do you want to go through it?

990
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,154
Wha...

991
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,435
- What if we lose?
- We're not gonna lose.

992
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,829
- Why? How do we know?
- Because we're winners!

993
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,956
We are winners. We're gonna win this.

994
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,678
They'll kill us out there.

995
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:04,272
I'm sure you'll all agree with me
when I say marriage is about commitment,

996
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:09,992
and we at <i>Confetti</i> magazine are committed
to pushing the envelope in weddings.

997
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:14,278
Today is about new and exciting weddings,
things that you haven't seen before.

998
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:17,352
<i>I know the couples are backstage now,</i>
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

999
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:21,353
<i>Do remember, the work is over now,</i>
<i>everything is prepared.</i>

1000
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:27,197
<i>So just relax, take a breath,</i>
<i>and get ready to enjoy yourselves.</i>

1001
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:31,308
Let's move on to our first wedding,
I think it's taking place over here.

1002
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:35,393
You can probably guess the theme.
Ladies and gentlemen, <i>Confetti</i> gives you:

1003
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:40,918
Josef and Isabelle.

1004
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:57,910
<i>Welcome to Wimbledon</i>
<i>on this absolutely glorious summer's day.</i>

1005
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,710
<i>There's a palpable sense of excitement</i>
<i>here amongst this full house.</i>

1006
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,792
<i>A real buzz around center court.</i>

1007
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:14,434
<i>This really does promise</i>
<i>to be the most wonderful occasion.</i>

1008
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:31,475
<i>Oh, and here they are! Here they come!</i>
<i>I say!</i>

1009
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:51,398
<i>Aw!</i>

1010
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,748
- Who's going to call?
- I will.

1011
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,996
Heads.

1012
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:07,389
- I'm sorry, it's tails.
- I'll serve.

1013
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:12,829
Josef Cecil Worrell
has won the toss and elected to serve.

1014
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,070
Quiet, please.

1015
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,037
Play.

1016
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:26,079
I, Josef Cecil Worrell, know of no legal reason

1017
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:29,311
why I may not be married
to Isabelle Frances Fontaine.

1018
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,118
15-love.

1019
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,077
I, Isabelle Frances Fontaine,

1020
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:36,596
know of no legal reason why
I cannot be married to Josef Cecil Worrell.

1021
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:38,159
15-all.

1022
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:42,631
I, Josef Cecil Worrell,
take you, Isabelle Frances Fontaine,

1023
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,438
to be my lawfully wedded wife.

1024
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,238
30-15.

1025
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:51,678
I, Isabelle Frances Fontaine, take you, Josef
Cecil Worrell, to be my lawful legal husband.

1026
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,830
30-all. New balls, please.

1027
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,030
Isabelle...

1028
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,514
I've never won a tournament,

1029
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:08,115
but I don't care, because I've won you.

1030
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:10,913
40-30.

1031
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:16,154
I know it's not been possible
to have any friends or family here today,

1032
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:21,394
but that doesn't matter, cos you're here,
and that's all I'll need now and for ever.

1033
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,232
Deuce.

1034
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:27,359
Isabelle, I can't promise
I'll never be jealous again,

1035
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:33,913
but I can promise that I'll look after you,
and love you, till the day I die.

1036
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:44,311
Josef Cecil Worrell,
Isabelle Frances Fontaine,

1037
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,550
it gives me great pleasure to pronounce...

1038
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,149
<i>Well, what a shame.</i>
<i>Covers are going on.</i>

1039
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,593
<i>Looks like a passing shower,</i>
<i>so hopefully it'll not...</i>

1040
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:03,355
<i>What's this? Someone's standing up.</i>

1041
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:07,399
<i>It's Cliff Richard! Oh, my goodness.</i>

1042
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:11,598
<i>He's going to sing!</i>
<i>What a privilege to be here.</i>

1043
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:58,471
Game, set, and match.

1044
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:12,118
- You could try a bit harder.
- I am! But this isn't what we wanted to do.

1045
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:15,909
I've had everybody telling us
what we have to do, sticking stuff on us.

1046
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,389
I've got leaves in places I didn't know existed.

1047
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,710
How do you think I feel?
They've done it to me.

1048
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,837
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
as if that wasn't a treat enough,

1049
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:27,117
and I think it really was,
we've three weddings to get through,

1050
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,839
and I can scarcely believe it,
we're onto our second.

1051
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:33,276
This one's very interesting.
I love it, I love the concept.

1052
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,669
I've not seen anything yet, but I love the idea.

1053
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:40,311
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Michael and Joanna.

1054
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,676
Oh, Tubs.

1055
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:28,149
I vow to never make you cover up
for shame or fear or duty.

1056
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:31,550
You'll never need to shed your clothes
for me to see your beauty.

1057
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:34,837
I won't ignore our differences,
but let them just connect.

1058
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:38,674
One word for that is compromise,
a better one's respect.

1059
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:42,992
They drove you mad, but do not fear,
for now you have a wife.

1060
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:47,915
Your husband's here, screw them, my dear,
their wedding but our life.

1061
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,198
You join the dots between the stars
like a pen of heaven's manna.

1062
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:56,831
You make two houses into one.
You join me up, Joanna.

1063
01:15:56,920 --> 01:16:01,072
You're like an angel overhead,
but with me on a cycle.

1064
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:05,756
Come live with me and be my love,
my Gabriel, my Michael.

1065
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:18,110
Ladies and gentlemen,
now that Michael and Joanna

1066
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:22,671
have exchanged head rings
and promised themselves to each other,

1067
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:27,880
the solemn moment has come for
the couple to make their marriage contract.

1068
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:30,076
If you'll please all stand.

1069
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:40,637
I call upon these persons here present
to witness that I, Michael Gabriel Collier...

1070
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:45,635
I call upon these persons here present
to witness that I, Michael Gabriel Collier,

1071
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:50,271
do take thee, Joanna Martha Roberts,
to be my lawful wedded wife.

1072
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:55,798
I call upon these persons here present
to witness that I, Joanna Martha Roberts,

1073
01:16:55,880 --> 01:17:01,238
do take thee, Michael Gabriel Collier,
to be my lawful wedded husband.

1074
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:06,474
It gives me great pleasure to pronounce
you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.

1075
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,591
Whoo-hoo!

1076
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:39,111
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
that was Michael and Joanna.

1077
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:44,354
And I think we can all... Well, let's raise
our glasses to them, the happy couple.

1078
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:48,877
Michael and Joanna.
What a wonderful, wonderful thing.

1079
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:53,113
Listen, everyone, we're not going
to worry about the steps, or the tune,

1080
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:57,557
we're just going to have fun, all right? None
of us are singers, none of us are dancers.

1081
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:00,871
- Well, I...
- I'm nervous of forgetting that bit.

1082
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,951
But do you know what? It doesn't matter.

1083
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:06,749
When we went through it I got it all wrong,
I thought, "I've let you down."

1084
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:10,628
Girls, girls, this is stage fright.
I've seen it a thousand times.

1085
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:13,280
- I don't want to let you down.
- Calm. Deep breaths.

1086
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:16,909
This is going to be fabulous.
We're going to do a wonderful show.

1087
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,798
For once in your life, Jen, I think you're right.

1088
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:23,077
I want you to give the warm
reception you gave the others

1089
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:27,517
to our final couple. It is Matt and Sam.

1090
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,359
Right! Yeah!

1091
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,997
- I love you.
- I love you, too. Right.

1092
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:24,629
How are you two?
Matthew Norris, Samantha Whiston.

1093
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:27,029
Marriage,
according to the law of this country,

1094
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:30,032
is the union of one man and one woman,

1095
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:36,195
voluntarily entered into for life,
to the exclusion of all others.

1096
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,871
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

1097
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:42,635
Matthew and Samantha
are going to make their marriage vows

1098
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:44,551
through the medium of song.

1099
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:30,868
Once again, thank you so much
for sharing this day with us.

1100
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,872
It's been so wonderful for us,
it's been really good of you

1101
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:39,193
to open up your most precious day to
our magazine, <i>Confetti.</i> Thank you so much.

1102
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:45,473
Smile, look like we're winners. They
won't give it to us if we look like losers.

1103
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:50,156
Right. First off, let's go through
couple by couple, couple by couple.

1104
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:53,149
The judge in the green suit seems to be a fan.

1105
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:56,710
- He was lovely, wasn't he?
- He keeps saying, "Well done."

1106
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,314
- Just wanted to say congratulations.
- Thanks.

1107
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,994
- Good luck.
- Congratulations.

1108
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,069
Yeah.

1109
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:05,754
- We'll have a drink later.
- Yeah.

1110
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,273
They are so two-faced.

1111
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:11,079
Think about innovation.
It was really innovative.

1112
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:16,188
- Well, let's all put down a score.
- Original. In that you wouldn't do it again.

1113
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:20,273
- You look so beautiful. You absolutely do.
- So do you.

1114
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:25,309
You've got a great body.
I had to tell him to stop looking at your bum.

1115
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,590
- They know they've won, that's why...
- They don't. They have not won.

1116
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:32,393
They have not necessarily won.
We could still win. For God's sake.

1117
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:37,756
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could have your attention, please.

1118
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,991
The judging panel have reached a verdict.

1119
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:44,675
And Vivien, the editor of the magazine,
has the golden envelope,

1120
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:48,992
and it would be churlish not to let her do
the honors, she's done so much of the work.

1121
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:51,719
So, Vivien, over to you.

1122
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:55,473
OK. And the winner is...

1123
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:04,717
Yes!

1124
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,109
Matt and Sam!

1125
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,673
Fix! It's a fix!

1126
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:51,832
- No, I think not really the time...
- It's a fix!

1127
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,798
Josef, it is not the time. Don't be a bad loser.

1128
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,916
- It's a fix.
- It's not a tennis match.

1129
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,993
- Donkey! Bring it on.
- It was a fair and square competition.

1130
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:05,517
I object to that in the strongest possible
terms. Let Matt and Sam have their moment.

1131
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:08,672
Round of applause for Matt and Sam.

1132
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:15,710
Now, I've got the key, I've got the key
to a half a million pound house

1133
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:20,396
for Matt and Sam, our winners,
winning fair and square.

1134
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:48,877
Since that competition, I've trusted
my intuition. I've trusted in my dreams.

1135
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:52,236
Because you have an idea like that,
and it's that big a success,

1136
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:56,871
you think, "Well, just trust
in yourself and go for it."

1137
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:01,238
So what I've done is take some of the profit
from that competition, the success of it,

1138
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:03,788
and I've invested it in music.

1139
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:07,393
Not just a couple of CDs.
I've bought a record label.

1140
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:09,550
And, you know, doing some A&R.

1141
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:24,393
<i>Oh, please, God, you know,</i>
<i>the deeds are gonna come through soon.</i>

1142
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:28,234
They've told us, haven't they, not to worry.
It's all all right, it's OK.

1143
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:33,030
But of course you never actually can believe
it until you're there, in your new home.

1144
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:36,635
- So, we're keeping our fingers crossed.
- Yeah.

1145
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,878
I would say to anyone
thinking of getting married, do it,

1146
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:49,635
if you are doing it for the reason
that you just love the other person.

1147
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:57,389
I went into a bit of a decline
after the weddings.

1148
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:00,040
- Post-nuptial depression.
- In bed for four weeks.

1149
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:01,678
Hit him pretty hard.

1150
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:06,197
<i>- But we're over that. I'm coaching.</i>
<i>- He's fantastic with children.</i>

1151
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:10,068
The forehand is this, there, there, there.
Got it? Right. Go away.

1152
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:12,594
<i>We're thinking</i>
<i>about one of our own.</i>

1153
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:15,035
Who knows what, er...

1154
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:19,470
nose they'll... get.

1155
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,357
Mainly, we've just sort of found out

1156
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:42,194
that the only people we really need
to be naked in front of is each other.

1157
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:45,795
We don't call ourselves naturists any more.
We call ourselves...

1158
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:48,519
- Well, I call myself Michael.
- And I'm Joanna.

1159
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:53,196
- And, er, yeah. That seems to work better.
- Better, I think.

1160
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:05,080
- Erm...
- You're not doing this, are you?

1161
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:09,073
- Are you... Are you really doing this?
- Shh, be quiet. This is my bit.

1162
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:12,197
Er, Gregory Hough, erm... I...

1163
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:14,271
Will you marry me?

1164
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:19,310
Is that the right hand?

1165
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:21,277
It's actually...

1166
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,437
One love.

1167
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:32,238
Peace.

1168
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:36,438
Don't stand around on the edges of other
people's weddings crying at pretty brides

1169
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:41,719
and thinking, "Oh, wouldn't it be nice if?"
If you see what you want, go and get it.

1170
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:44,314
So that's what we're doing.
And you should too.

1171
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,790
Heron and Hough, your dreams are enough.

1172
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:07,194
- You were great.
- Well, you were.

1173
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:36,913
