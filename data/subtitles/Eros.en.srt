00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,079
Cloe,

4
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,999
Why do we talk in such a way?

5
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,167
This is what you said

6
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,546
Me?
Everything is my fault

7
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:54,258
Why do you blame me when the
relationship faced with problems?

8
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,760
What are you saying? Wish? Yes

9
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,263
I don't want to wish

10
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,265
And you always hope
your wish comes true

11
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,560
Why can't you accept the fact
that we've broken up?

12
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,897
This way, everything is understood,
we'll know what to do

13
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,359
If I've not mistaken,
you always want to make things clear

14
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,611
Isn't that correct?

15
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,030
Answer me!

16
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:20,075
Can we go now?

17
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:41,740
Thank you, Nuccio

18
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,039
Sing

19
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:06,009
Why haven't we been here before?

20
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,393
Not enough curiosity

21
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,646
Yes

22
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,352
Do you still remember
the beautiful things?

23
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,939
What do you want to remember,
the sun, the moon?

24
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,691
Don't you tell me suddenly
you've become a romantic person

25
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:49,530
I do all these things because
I don't want to be trapped in the past

26
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,073
This is a must

27
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,161
What I do remember is not the day,
but clouds

28
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:59,581
The sad feelings emerged
when summer came to the end

29
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:04,711
I don't want to be sad, that's why
sometimes I smile without reason

30
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:06,547
So, smile

31
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,944
How are you?

32
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:32,841
How are you?
- How are you?

33
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,802
Can I take 2 apples for the horse?
- Yes

34
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,721
How are you?
- How are you?

35
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:42,684
Do you know her?

36
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,686
Who?

37
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,855
The girl who went outjust now

38
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,484
The girl lives below the tower

39
00:10:59,409 --> 00:10:59,993
Thank you

40
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:06,643
I like this location,
today I was sued

41
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:15,444
If you want personal space,
it's up to you

42
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:31,293
You're not allowed to talk in such a way,
who do you think you are?

43
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:32,461
You're silly
- Is that so?

44
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:33,378
Yes!

45
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:37,674
Tell me what do we do the whole day
besides fighting, nothing else

46
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,677
What do you wanna do? Sex?
- Yes, sex

47
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,430
But make me happy,
sex is not an illusion

48
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,599
You think too much

49
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,851
Walk quickly!

50
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:54,316
I hate this, but I get it everytime

51
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,486
Isn't that funny?

52
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,489
You are always searching for purity

53
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,491
You are a hated person

54
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:09,039
I can't do anything
I like this

55
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,000
You like it?

56
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,629
Let us be here

57
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,123
What are you finding inside?

58
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:58,625
Yes

59
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:05,340
I like old things
- But I am young

60
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:07,843
I like it even more

61
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:17,144
Is this an invitation?

62
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:21,982
Hopes you like it

63
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:23,942
What?

64
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,571
Generally

65
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,057
I seems to know you for a long time

66
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:56,808
No

67
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:01,897
You're the opposite type

68
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,902
Other types

69
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:09,821
Who?

70
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:12,282
A saxophone player

71
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,037
I saw 2 butterflies near the beach

72
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,789
They're always following me

73
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,417
I'm sure you've met one of them

74
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:23,919
No

75
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:28,006
But I believes one of them is with us

76
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:31,009
You want us to find it?
- No

77
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,095
No?
- No

78
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:35,639
This is a message
- Message?

79
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,935
Might be a message related to 2 people

80
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:41,186
Maybe

81
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:10,757
I feel cold

82
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,091
Goodbye

83
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:18,594
Goodbye

84
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,264
Are you here?

85
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:45,078
If I throw it, what will happen?

86
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:48,248
I tell your name

87
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,440
My name is Linda

88
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:01,173
How are you?
- How are you?

89
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:18,417
Hello?

90
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:20,210
How are you?
- How are you?

91
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:23,297
Where are you?
- Beach

92
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:27,134
The horse has ran away,
I want to bring them back

93
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:30,846
I am looking at the snow
- Where?

94
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:33,682
Paris
- I can't hear you, where are you?

95
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:35,392
I am in Paris

96
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,228
Is it snowing there?

97
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:41,190
I hope it snows here too

98
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:43,358
Cleo, if you're saying this

99
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:46,361
You makes me want to go there

100
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:48,197
I hope to get close to you

101
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:52,242
But the way you analyse problems

102
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:54,369
Hello? I can't hear

103
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:56,872
I said the way you analyse problems

104
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,917
The way I analyse problems,
how do we change?

105
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:01,543
Forget it

106
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:04,338
This is about searching

107
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:06,215
Foundation to something

108
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:10,052
Now I can't think of anything

109
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:15,015
Snow makes me calm,
I'm nervous now

110
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:18,477
la might be your best friend today

111
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:22,439
Kiss you
- Me too

112
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:29,947
Let's go back!

113
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:52,246
I don't remember exactly
when it happened

114
00:31:52,496 --> 00:31:56,834
It was 2 weeks ago

115
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:59,920
Yesterday,
that was the day that I lost my...

116
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:03,632
It was the day after we're told we'll
be pitching this Samson's account

117
00:32:05,217 --> 00:32:08,804
The copy guy comes in
and he's wearing a...

118
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:12,182
What's the socially acceptable term

119
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:17,563
Somebody encountered this trap,
kill it

120
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:20,816
We're shocked,
our molecules are moving

121
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:25,654
And before we processed this betrayal,
Howard says calmly

122
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:27,656
He decides to do something
about his hair problem

123
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:30,534
And he'll appreciate it if we kindly
refrain from making it

124
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:33,328
A topic of comment or conversation.

125
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:34,997
This is my team

126
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:37,833
Good people.
They're great at what they do

127
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,668
It's like Jazz

128
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:44,590
We can't talk about this tragedy
of Hallet's hair

129
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:48,677
I mean you should see him,
faces like starving animals

130
00:32:49,428 --> 00:32:50,512
Look at me

131
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:57,644
Do something!

132
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,108
It is an alarm clock

133
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:06,820
They want a new concept
for their shitty little alarm

134
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:09,907
You know the, Samson,
'coz time is important to us

135
00:33:11,408 --> 00:33:16,205
We're polishing the vase
when the house falls down

136
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:21,877
- Do you've an alarm clock?
- I do. Yes.

137
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:25,214
- You happy with it?
- It does the job.

138
00:33:25,214 --> 00:33:28,342
Right, but you need a new alarm clock,
Dr Pearl

139
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:29,760
And it's gotta be a Samson

140
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:32,221
A new colour, a new texture

141
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:37,100
You want softer kick

142
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,895
You wanna kick it off a night stand
every morning for a year, you can

143
00:33:40,145 --> 00:33:44,066
Our mechanism is incredibly

144
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:47,236
You see what I'm saying?
The message is simple

145
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:50,364
The life is lacking something

146
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,120
Pearl

147
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:59,206
Yes, it's short for Dr Pearl

148
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:02,209
You're talking about alarm clocks

149
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,381
All around me, these other firms,
they can hit home-runs

150
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:08,924
Left
Right

151
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:13,971
Melt in your mouth, not your hand,
it's great!

152
00:34:14,555 --> 00:34:16,431
Dollar for dollar

153
00:34:24,314 --> 00:34:27,818
Any of 'ur patients famous?
- I can't discuss my patients

154
00:34:27,985 --> 00:34:30,779
All right, no, I saw a sketch
about that one at a night club

155
00:34:31,363 --> 00:34:34,199
Doctor patient,
patience, doctor

156
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:37,286
I remember that, I want to remember
the names, anything personal

157
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:42,082
Mr Penrox ain't

158
00:34:42,207 --> 00:34:43,125
Do you remember Jack?

159
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:45,544
I really can't help you there

160
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:48,380
Oh my god,
their sales up to the roof

161
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:50,048
I have the data

162
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:55,679
Your sister mentioned something
about a recurring dream

163
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:58,640
The woman in the dream.

164
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:02,978
The woman in the dream,
why did you say it that way?

165
00:35:03,312 --> 00:35:04,730
Cecelia says it like that

166
00:35:05,147 --> 00:35:07,608
Is Cecelia is your wife?
- Yeah

167
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,194
And you tell her about the dream?

168
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:16,241
I make the mistake of
mentioning it once

169
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:20,537
Now it has become a ritual,
it's a ritual

170
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:23,081
Until yesterday

171
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:26,043
What happened yesterday?

172
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,379
Yesterday I came down to the kitchen,
I was telling her about the dream

173
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:32,633
The latest installment.
There was a woman in the dream

174
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:37,137
When I wake up, I don't remember who
it is, but in the dream, I know her

175
00:35:37,554 --> 00:35:40,599
It's not a sex dream

176
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:43,560
Exactly

177
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:48,565
But we're there and I said,
'Boy, who is it? '

178
00:35:49,775 --> 00:35:54,029
Because I was thinking about it, I felt
like the air in the room has change

179
00:35:54,196 --> 00:35:58,659
I look over and there she was,
shoulder shaking, she's crying

180
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:00,327
Why is she crying?

181
00:36:01,328 --> 00:36:02,204
I don't know

182
00:36:02,913 --> 00:36:04,039
Did you asked her?

183
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:07,042
She won't say it

184
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:09,419
She is upset?

185
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:12,339
Yes

186
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:16,385
Have you given any
thought of sitting down?

187
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:23,475
I'm wondering if cavemen
sat around talking about their dreams

188
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,602
And having coded conversations
with their wives

189
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:27,229
Over cold venison.

190
00:36:29,064 --> 00:36:32,025
Do you often imagine
that you're a caveman?

191
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:34,444
No

192
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:36,947
I am happy with 1955

193
00:36:37,447 --> 00:36:41,743
Look at the advances
in medicine, polio, TB

194
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:45,330
That was a joke

195
00:36:47,457 --> 00:36:50,043
So, how is it with Cecelia
since her crying in the kitchen?

196
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:51,545
It's great

197
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:57,634
She's like a nurse on the night
when I've my tonsils out

198
00:36:58,051 --> 00:37:00,929
Civil and unavailable

199
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:07,769
And how long is it since
you've been having this dream?

200
00:37:08,145 --> 00:37:08,812
That's the thing...

201
00:37:09,146 --> 00:37:11,148
It was the night when Hallet show up
with a new on his head

202
00:37:13,525 --> 00:37:15,944
They show the woman in the dream

203
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:19,573
I've to show Cecelia
that I know the answer

204
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,408
Or she's gonna be gone

205
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:25,787
You've to help me, if this woman is
pulling away, I don't know what I'll do

206
00:37:25,954 --> 00:37:28,540
So, I need to know the answer now

207
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:32,252
Before I leave, I gotta know

208
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:35,964
Mr Penrose

209
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,677
Human beings is not a car brake, I mean
we'll talk, we'll see what happens

210
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:44,598
Everybody is different.
You're under a lot of stress.

211
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,018
You're anxious about the job,
the recurring dream, the situation...

212
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:50,187
With your wife, you're much
more anxious than usual.

213
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:51,104
Exactly.

214
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:54,650
There're various ways I can try
to help you reduce 'ur anxiety.

215
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:57,486
First, I'll have you lie down
on the couch over here.

216
00:38:03,575 --> 00:38:05,786
This couch?
Yes, right here

217
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:09,873
Just put 'ur head up on one end and
slide your feet down the other end

218
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:12,918
This works for people, the couch?

219
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:16,588
I can tell you,
I've great success with this couch

220
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:23,929
Should I take my shoes off?
- Yes, whatever makes you comfortable

221
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:32,479
We want your mind completely clear

222
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:35,023
Should I close my eyes?
- I find that helps

223
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:37,025
'coz I see things in great details

224
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:04,011
Sometimes, I imagine myself
as a person with no responsibility

225
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:07,723
That's very interesting

226
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:11,560
Part of me knows I enjoy it

227
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:14,938
Now, I want you to tell me
about 'ur dream

228
00:39:15,772 --> 00:39:16,356
Okay

229
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:20,027
But first, take a minute, go back
to the beginning of the dream

230
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:21,528
When you got there,

231
00:39:21,904 --> 00:39:25,407
Just pause for a moment, and
hold the first image in your mind

232
00:39:28,243 --> 00:39:31,914
We at the beginning?
- Yes.

233
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:35,375
Tell me the first thing
you see in the dream

234
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:37,586
A woman's face

235
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:41,048
Can you see the woman
in 'ur mind right now?

236
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,927
Yes.

237
00:39:45,177 --> 00:39:48,305
Where are you? Are you very close
or are you far-away?

238
00:39:48,305 --> 00:39:51,934
We've facing each other in bed.
It's right after

239
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:59,608
That's very close.

240
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:03,403
Think for a minute what it feels like

241
00:40:05,697 --> 00:40:06,990
How do you feel?

242
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:14,456
Then what happens?

243
00:40:15,624 --> 00:40:18,794
She looks at me with kinda funny smile

244
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:21,463
And goes off to the bathroom

245
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:25,801
Turns on the tub and lets it run

246
00:40:31,515 --> 00:40:35,394
This is when I realised we've
been in this room before

247
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:38,230
Describe the room to me?

248
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:44,194
Feels like a hotel room

249
00:40:45,696 --> 00:40:47,447
Doesn't feel like a place
where anybody live

250
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:51,451
The only person
belongs to us

251
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,831
So, when I hear the water running,
I think,

252
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:59,960
I love it, that
she's gonna take a bath and I,

253
00:41:01,253 --> 00:41:04,548
Begin to imagine her getting ready.

254
00:41:05,215 --> 00:41:08,635
Taking off her make-up,
putting her hair up

255
00:41:09,553 --> 00:41:12,973
So excited thinking about it.

256
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:19,062
When I hear her turn the water off,

257
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:22,816
I'm gonna go right
in the tub with her.

258
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:27,279
That's when the phone starts ringing.

259
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:34,077
- Who do you think might be calling?
- I don't know.

260
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:38,624
Aren't you afraid of being discovered?
- No.

261
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:41,335
Not even a slightest feel guilty?

262
00:41:43,295 --> 00:41:45,464
- No.
- Not the tiniest bit?

263
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:46,882
No, no guilt whatsoever.

264
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:52,179
Then what happened?

265
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:04,024
Got better things to do
than answering the phone

266
00:42:04,441 --> 00:42:05,776
She takes her bath

267
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:09,822
She gets up and dry herself up

268
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:16,912
She climbs up on the sink
in front of the mirror like a cat

269
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:21,333
And puts on her make-up

270
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:23,836
She finishes and,

271
00:42:25,462 --> 00:42:27,965
Back in the bedroom,
I watched her as she,

272
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:30,050
Get dressed.

273
00:42:30,926 --> 00:42:32,886
In the bathroom for a minute,
close the doors

274
00:42:36,348 --> 00:42:39,184
She comes back out in her living room

275
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:46,358
She puts her hand on my face

276
00:42:49,987 --> 00:42:51,780
There is a glove on her hand.

277
00:42:52,447 --> 00:42:53,991
She kisses me.

278
00:42:58,162 --> 00:43:00,205
I just lay there for a minute.

279
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:06,003
Then the phone rings again, I got up

280
00:43:06,003 --> 00:43:10,257
Answer it, but there's
no one at the other end

281
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,761
- Then what happens?
- I wake up.

282
00:43:16,013 --> 00:43:18,223
- Should I stop?
- No, no, stay in the dream.

283
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:32,821
I feel so sad.
Yes, you wanna be with her.

284
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:34,364
Yes.

285
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:39,036
Stay there on the bed.
You're in the dream now.

286
00:43:39,036 --> 00:43:42,247
And I want you to go back.

287
00:43:42,581 --> 00:43:45,959
I want you to go back in the dream
when the woman is in the bathroom.

288
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:06,230
The bathroom door is close?

289
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:07,564
Yes.

290
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:10,025
And you're lying on the bed?
- Yes.

291
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:23,580
Raise your head slowly, slowly

292
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,377
Where are you?
- I am standing.

293
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:30,420
And where is the purse?

294
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:32,923
The purse?

295
00:44:33,632 --> 00:44:37,553
Yes, you said that when she sat down
next to you, she picked up a purse

296
00:44:40,973 --> 00:44:44,226
- You see it?
- Yes.

297
00:44:46,645 --> 00:44:49,106
I want you to go to the purse.

298
00:44:54,945 --> 00:44:56,613
I can't.
- Why?

299
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:08,750
You're in a very vulnerable
state right now,

300
00:45:09,126 --> 00:45:11,170
It's crucial you do not feel
judged at this moment.

301
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:14,006
If you turn around,
any expression on my face,

302
00:45:14,006 --> 00:45:18,427
No matter how sympathetic
or supportive

303
00:45:18,427 --> 00:45:22,222
And I cannot allowed that,
I'll not allowed that.

304
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:27,019
Thank you.

305
00:45:45,162 --> 00:45:47,080
Let's go back to your work
for a while.

306
00:45:57,424 --> 00:45:59,801
You feel as if
you've run out of ideas?

307
00:46:00,594 --> 00:46:02,596
I feel like I've run out
of good ideas.

308
00:46:02,804 --> 00:46:04,181
Something is missing.

309
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:05,807
Yes.

310
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:11,980
What is your favourite part
of the dream?

311
00:46:19,029 --> 00:46:21,281
When she standing at the door
while the phone rings

312
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:22,366
Why?

313
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:29,373
By standing at the door and
letting the phone rings,

314
00:46:29,623 --> 00:46:33,252
She's keeping outside world
away for a minute.

315
00:46:36,255 --> 00:46:39,341
That's where I screw up, I answer
the phone and the dream ends

316
00:46:39,466 --> 00:46:42,928
Maybe if I didn't answer the phone,
she'll come back

317
00:46:43,971 --> 00:46:47,432
So, the phone is an interruption
from the outside world.

318
00:46:47,432 --> 00:46:48,350
Yes.

319
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,854
Like the alarm clock.

320
00:46:54,064 --> 00:46:55,232
Maybe.

321
00:47:11,415 --> 00:47:14,168
You hear the alarm clock
in the morning, what happens?

322
00:47:14,585 --> 00:47:17,713
I turn it off.
- Yes, but what did you wanna do?

323
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,631
Go back to sleep.

324
00:47:19,756 --> 00:47:24,219
- Why don't you?
- If I don't get up,

325
00:47:24,803 --> 00:47:27,097
I'll fall back to sleep
and I will be late for work.

326
00:47:27,681 --> 00:47:31,268
Yes, yes, but you just want a few
more moments of sleep, just a few.

327
00:47:31,685 --> 00:47:34,980
You've to reset the entire alarm

328
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:37,566
And the setting mechanism
isn't that precise.

329
00:47:39,026 --> 00:47:40,611
What'll solve the problem then?

330
00:47:42,946 --> 00:47:46,700
You've to turn the alarm off, and then
turn it off again automatically

331
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:08,680
I actually think I would.

332
00:48:15,854 --> 00:48:20,567
Samson,
the alarm clock of your dreams.

333
00:48:22,236 --> 00:48:24,822
Sounds like one of those good ideas.

334
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,160
Can I get up now?

335
00:48:31,161 --> 00:48:32,204
Absolutely.

336
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:37,960
Feeling better?

337
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:39,628
Yes.

338
00:48:42,881 --> 00:48:44,675
I feel like we've accomplished
something today.

339
00:48:57,145 --> 00:48:59,940
No need to thanked me.
The work is an honourable reward.

340
00:49:05,737 --> 00:49:08,949
Breakthrough is exhausting.

341
00:49:12,536 --> 00:49:14,329
I feel really tired all of a sudden.

342
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:18,667
Are you all right?
- I feel like I can lay down again

343
00:49:20,711 --> 00:49:24,756
You've some time left on your hour.

344
00:49:36,393 --> 00:49:37,060
Thank you.

345
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:06,358
Are you up?

346
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:11,155
You must have hit the alarm
about a half a dozen times.

347
00:51:12,281 --> 00:51:13,866
It's become a ritual.

348
00:51:17,744 --> 00:51:18,412
What?

349
00:51:22,332 --> 00:51:25,252
Promise me you'll talk to Hall
about his hair today.

350
00:51:31,175 --> 00:51:32,301
I gotta go.

351
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:09,421
We can't pitch this,
we can't present this.

352
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:30,067
We work very hard on this.

353
00:52:30,567 --> 00:52:32,903
And I'll like to think we've
accomplished something.

354
00:52:33,195 --> 00:52:35,948
Don't you feel like we've
accomplished something?

355
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,201
No, I don't.

356
00:52:40,285 --> 00:52:41,829
Neither do I.

357
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:48,418
We're living in the shadow
of a freaking snooze alarm

358
00:52:49,878 --> 00:52:51,755
Where do you go from there?

359
00:52:57,678 --> 00:52:58,470
What?

360
00:56:06,116 --> 00:56:07,534
How are you now?

361
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:09,578
Fine

362
00:56:10,913 --> 00:56:13,582
Don't you ever come again,
epidemic illness

363
00:56:16,585 --> 00:56:17,753
No

364
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:27,429
You don't have to

365
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:29,598
That person is gone

366
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:31,225
Look at my face

367
00:56:32,309 --> 00:56:34,144
Can't wear it anymore

368
00:56:36,146 --> 00:56:37,272
No

369
00:56:40,442 --> 00:56:41,610
You will be fine

370
00:56:45,948 --> 00:56:48,742
Do you want to try?
- No

371
00:56:50,994 --> 00:56:53,080
I believes you've done it well

372
00:56:54,998 --> 00:56:57,292
Do you remember

373
00:56:58,001 --> 00:57:00,045
The first time we met?

374
00:57:02,005 --> 00:57:02,881
Yes

375
00:57:06,218 --> 00:57:07,886
Do you remember my hand?

376
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,306
Yes

377
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:20,357
Where is block 1 first floor?

378
00:57:20,357 --> 00:57:22,442
To the left
- Here?

379
00:57:22,442 --> 00:57:23,777
Yes
- Thank you

380
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:30,909
Who is it?

381
00:57:33,412 --> 00:57:36,665
Is Miss Hua here?
- Who is looking for her?

382
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,836
I'm Master Jin's worker,
he asked me to come

383
00:58:35,432 --> 00:58:38,227
Mr Zhao, wanna go?
- Yes

384
00:58:42,773 --> 00:58:45,818
Miss, Master's Jin worker is here

385
00:58:47,528 --> 00:58:48,737
Let him ini

386
00:58:51,365 --> 00:58:53,992
You can come in

387
00:58:55,369 --> 00:58:57,371
You can come in

388
00:59:07,756 --> 00:59:09,716
Miss Hua

389
00:59:10,634 --> 00:59:13,595
You're Master Jin's worker?
- Yes

390
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,097
Name?

391
00:59:15,973 --> 00:59:17,558
Xiaozhang

392
00:59:20,435 --> 00:59:21,603
What's the matter?

393
00:59:23,647 --> 00:59:24,731
Nothing

394
00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:28,402
Stand nicely

395
00:59:37,494 --> 00:59:39,246
Put down your arms

396
00:59:49,006 --> 00:59:50,215
What happened to you?

397
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:54,469
Nothing

398
00:59:57,389 --> 00:59:58,599
Take out your pants!

399
01:00:01,393 --> 01:00:02,269
Take it out!

400
01:00:05,189 --> 01:00:07,357
Do you want me to call your Master?

401
01:00:10,736 --> 01:00:11,695
Take it out!

402
01:00:29,505 --> 01:00:30,714
Underwear too

403
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:49,191
Nothing?

404
01:00:50,943 --> 01:00:51,985
Come here

405
01:00:57,783 --> 01:00:59,117
Give me your hand

406
01:01:18,262 --> 01:01:20,597
Have you touched a woman before?

407
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:29,565
No, how can you become a tailor?

408
01:01:33,819 --> 01:01:35,779
You'll touch many women

409
01:01:36,655 --> 01:01:38,407
It becomes like this when you touched

410
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:41,451
Who wants to find you?

411
01:01:51,086 --> 01:01:53,922
Am I good to you?

412
01:01:56,383 --> 01:01:57,301
All right

413
01:01:58,385 --> 01:01:59,678
You remembered

414
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:03,432
Your master is old

415
01:02:05,058 --> 01:02:07,186
He said you will be successful

416
01:02:09,229 --> 01:02:13,400
Maybe you'll become
a tailor after this

417
01:02:18,697 --> 01:02:21,074
You have to remember
your feeling today

418
01:02:22,493 --> 01:02:25,704
The dress made by you
is gonna be very beautiful

419
01:03:43,657 --> 01:03:44,867
Miss Hua

420
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,410
We have yet to congratulate you

421
01:03:47,619 --> 01:03:49,454
Some said you are married

422
01:03:50,414 --> 01:03:53,667
How come we don't know
such wonderful news?

423
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:59,423
Xiaozhang? He went out

424
01:04:00,215 --> 01:04:03,677
Yes, the festival is near

425
01:04:03,886 --> 01:04:05,721
A bit busy nowadays

426
01:04:07,055 --> 01:04:09,099
Why do you say such things?

427
01:04:09,391 --> 01:04:12,186
You know Xiaozhang

428
01:04:12,352 --> 01:04:14,062
He won't served other customers

429
01:04:14,354 --> 01:04:16,231
He only makes your dress

430
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:21,612
All right, when Xiaozhang is back,
I asked him to come to your house

431
01:04:22,946 --> 01:04:24,865
All right

432
01:04:25,616 --> 01:04:28,368
Didn't I say not to come again?

433
01:04:28,994 --> 01:04:31,663
If they see, what will happened?
You take care of me?

434
01:04:31,955 --> 01:04:33,290
I take care of you

435
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:36,210
What can you do?

436
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:38,420
What do I eat later on?

437
01:04:38,795 --> 01:04:40,172
Eat me

438
01:04:40,631 --> 01:04:42,508
Irritating

439
01:04:54,812 --> 01:04:56,438
Forget it

440
01:04:58,857 --> 01:04:59,942
Don't be like that

441
01:05:08,367 --> 01:05:12,538
Next time, you go back first,
I called you, ok?

442
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:20,003
I go back first
- Just go

443
01:05:27,553 --> 01:05:31,557
Mr Zhao, are you going?
- There are things to do

444
01:05:32,141 --> 01:05:33,142
Goodbye

445
01:05:39,022 --> 01:05:41,984
Ying, if Mr Zhao come again,
tell him I'm not at home

446
01:05:42,317 --> 01:05:43,193
Yes

447
01:05:46,196 --> 01:05:47,823
Has Xiozhang came?
- Not yet

448
01:05:48,157 --> 01:05:50,033
Call him, ask him to come quickly

449
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:54,079
What Adonis?

450
01:05:55,289 --> 01:05:56,373
Him?

451
01:05:56,832 --> 01:05:58,625
He is my cousin brother

452
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:01,795
You always hear rumours

453
01:06:05,591 --> 01:06:08,385
Looks like Adonis
- Waiting for you

454
01:06:09,678 --> 01:06:12,097
His hair is less than you

455
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:19,146
I have choosen the house

456
01:06:19,813 --> 01:06:22,858
When you come tonight,
bring the cheque along

457
01:06:23,442 --> 01:06:25,527
I want to give deposit

458
01:06:27,029 --> 01:06:29,823
What?
- Miss Kofi

459
01:06:30,365 --> 01:06:32,493
Has Xiaozhang came?
Yes

460
01:06:32,993 --> 01:06:36,497
Give him this clothes, tell him Boss Chu
bought for me this clothes from France

461
01:06:37,414 --> 01:06:39,166
Let him do it carefully

462
01:06:40,042 --> 01:06:42,294
Give him a few dumplings, say
I'm the one who give him to eat

463
01:06:42,836 --> 01:06:43,879
All right

464
01:06:44,463 --> 01:06:45,297
Hello?

465
01:06:46,048 --> 01:06:47,216
What did you say?

466
01:06:48,217 --> 01:06:50,469
What do you scare?

467
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:53,055
Scare of your wife?

468
01:06:53,889 --> 01:06:55,724
Scare of me?

469
01:06:57,017 --> 01:06:58,435
Scare of me is all right

470
01:07:00,395 --> 01:07:02,356
Don't come tonight

471
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:05,150
This dumplings is given by miss

472
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:06,985
She makes it herself

473
01:07:08,779 --> 01:07:10,531
Thank you
- Okay

474
01:07:10,697 --> 01:07:12,950
Goodbye
- Goodbye

475
01:07:13,242 --> 01:07:14,159
See you again

476
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:42,104
Master Zhang, so early

477
01:07:42,312 --> 01:07:45,899
Have miss woke up?
- Miss is talking with Mr Zhao

478
01:07:46,024 --> 01:07:47,442
Any problem?

479
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:51,113
The dress is ready,
I want to let her try

480
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:52,948
Give it to me

481
01:07:53,323 --> 01:07:55,784
Looks like they're
gonna discuss further

482
01:07:58,203 --> 01:07:59,163
All right

483
01:07:59,955 --> 01:08:02,958
If there's problem, call me

484
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:04,418
Okay
- I go first

485
01:08:07,963 --> 01:08:09,006
There's no need for you
to say like this

486
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:12,968
How many times must I say
we're relatives

487
01:08:13,135 --> 01:08:15,137
We don't have any relationship at all

488
01:08:19,516 --> 01:08:23,770
I know, you're boring, right?

489
01:08:24,813 --> 01:08:28,984
Wanna dumped me just like that?
It's not that easy

490
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:30,986
You listen carefully

491
01:08:32,529 --> 01:08:35,240
If you don't do things that satisfy me

492
01:08:36,825 --> 01:08:38,577
I won't let you go

493
01:08:44,249 --> 01:08:47,628
Miss, Master Zhang
is waiting for you outside

494
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:56,053
How dare for him to come

495
01:08:58,722 --> 01:09:01,850
I don't want.
I won't sew at there again

496
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,729
Xiaozhang has gone out,
who is talking?

497
01:09:07,648 --> 01:09:08,982
Sis Ying, how are you?

498
01:09:09,525 --> 01:09:12,194
I am Jin, he has gone out

499
01:09:13,362 --> 01:09:16,281
What? Miss is looking for him?

500
01:09:17,366 --> 01:09:19,493
If he comes back,
I ask him to go at once

501
01:09:21,161 --> 01:09:24,540
You're welcome, okay

502
01:09:31,296 --> 01:09:33,423
Hello Mr Shao?

503
01:09:35,425 --> 01:09:36,426
Me

504
01:09:37,511 --> 01:09:39,012
You can't recognise my voice?

505
01:09:42,516 --> 01:09:44,393
Terrible

506
01:09:46,395 --> 01:09:47,813
You didn't go out?

507
01:09:50,774 --> 01:09:51,775
I am okay

508
01:09:57,156 --> 01:09:59,408
Call you, nothing

509
01:10:00,742 --> 01:10:02,828
These 2 days

510
01:10:03,453 --> 01:10:05,038
I miss you

511
01:10:07,749 --> 01:10:08,584
Who?

512
01:10:10,544 --> 01:10:11,753
Him?

513
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:14,631
I didn't see him

514
01:10:16,592 --> 01:10:18,218
I didn't see him for some time

515
01:10:21,138 --> 01:10:23,015
Mr Shao

516
01:10:24,016 --> 01:10:26,852
I want to work

517
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:31,231
Being at home is quite boring

518
01:10:31,773 --> 01:10:33,233
Nothing to do

519
01:10:35,944 --> 01:10:37,196
Mr Shao

520
01:10:37,654 --> 01:10:39,323
When I am performing

521
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:41,492
You have to come and watch

522
01:10:43,452 --> 01:10:44,786
You promised to come?

523
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:50,000
Yes

524
01:10:58,050 --> 01:10:59,593
Are you

525
01:11:00,052 --> 01:11:01,261
Busy later on?

526
01:11:06,183 --> 01:11:08,185
I treat you to eat supper

527
01:11:10,437 --> 01:11:11,730
Where?

528
01:11:14,608 --> 01:11:15,567
Okay

529
01:11:17,986 --> 01:11:20,072
So, you must come

530
01:11:21,156 --> 01:11:22,324
Okay

531
01:11:26,662 --> 01:11:27,704
See you later

532
01:11:36,672 --> 01:11:38,006
Is it tight enough?

533
01:11:50,394 --> 01:11:51,687
Am I fat?

534
01:11:54,022 --> 01:11:55,440
A little

535
01:11:55,732 --> 01:11:57,359
You're usually 23 inches

536
01:11:58,026 --> 01:11:58,902
Now

537
01:12:05,701 --> 01:12:07,578
24 inches, 2 inches more

538
01:12:11,415 --> 01:12:12,708
Do like previously

539
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:16,128
I want to go to work

540
01:12:17,212 --> 01:12:18,463
Will be thin

541
01:12:20,591 --> 01:12:23,260
Don't you misunderstand

542
01:12:23,427 --> 01:12:25,846
I don't want to force you

543
01:12:26,221 --> 01:12:27,556
I heard that you're sick

544
01:12:27,848 --> 01:12:29,933
I called to ask how are you

545
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:32,478
Yes

546
01:12:34,021 --> 01:12:38,066

549
01:12:44,865 --> 01:12:46,408
I asked Xiaozhang to come

550
01:12:46,408 --> 01:12:48,452
Okay

551
01:12:49,244 --> 01:12:51,497

552
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:57,878
Who do you think you're?

553
01:12:57,878 --> 01:12:59,755
You're just a hooker

554
01:13:00,672 --> 01:13:02,841
You're just like last time?
Without money

555
01:13:03,133 --> 01:13:04,468
No need to say anything

556
01:14:03,861 --> 01:14:06,488
You are back
- Yes

557
01:14:07,906 --> 01:14:08,866
What did he say?

558
01:14:11,118 --> 01:14:13,579
He is sick, ask me
to find him after a few days

559
01:14:14,204 --> 01:14:16,999
It's more than half a year

560
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:19,543
He can't take it anymore

561
01:14:19,877 --> 01:14:22,504
She didn't go to work

562
01:14:22,713 --> 01:14:25,841
Everyday live in luxury

563
01:14:26,008 --> 01:14:27,551
Her lifestyle is luxurious

564
01:14:27,968 --> 01:14:30,179
Force her after 2 days

565
01:14:30,179 --> 01:14:32,264
The festival is here soon

566
01:15:05,297 --> 01:15:07,257
Look at all these clothes

567
01:15:08,133 --> 01:15:09,968
All needs to be changed

568
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:12,638
Just sell it

569
01:15:14,097 --> 01:15:15,599
You keep the money

570
01:15:17,601 --> 01:15:19,186

You keep all these clothes

574
01:15:44,628 --> 01:15:45,838
A lot are still new

575
01:15:51,051 --> 01:15:54,054
I can't wear that many,
I want to go other places

576
01:15:54,763 --> 01:15:56,473
I don't want to bring so many things

577
01:15:58,016 --> 01:15:59,935
Keeping it is not useful

578
01:16:01,979 --> 01:16:03,355
Just bring it along

579
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:06,108

580
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:23,834

I can't wear all those clothes

648
01:23:26,381 --> 01:23:27,508
I have become thin

649
01:23:30,552 --> 01:23:32,596
Want to measure for me again?

650
01:23:34,389 --> 01:23:35,307
There's no need

651
01:23:36,975 --> 01:23:38,644
I am used to your body

652
01:23:41,438 --> 01:23:43,649
Measure with your hand is enough

653
01:26:10,128 --> 01:26:15,175
Do you know where Miss Hua went?
- You try to find her at the beach

654
01:26:15,592 --> 01:26:17,594
She is usually there at this time

655
01:26:17,970 --> 01:26:18,512
What is she doing over there?

656
01:26:18,679 --> 01:26:21,807
To work, what else?

657
01:26:22,182 --> 01:26:24,476
It is raining heavily outside

658
01:28:38,610 --> 01:28:40,195
Is it enough?

659
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:44,783

That person have gone

670
01:29:29,203 --> 01:29:33,248
Can't wear it anymore

671
01:29:35,584 --> 01:29:36,710
No

01:29:39,797 --> 01:29:41,173
You will be fine

673
01:29:45,302 --> 01:29:46,762
Do you want to try?

674
01:29:47,596 --> 01:29:48,555
No

675
01:29:50,224 --> 01:29:52,351
I believe you did it very well

676
01:29:54,102 --> 01:29:55,813
Do you remember

677
01:29:57,272 --> 01:29:59,566
The first time we met?

678
01:30:01,985 --> 01:30:02,986
Yes

679
01:30:06,156 --> 01:30:08,575
Do you remember my hand?

680
01:30:09,785 --> 01:30:10,911
Yes

681
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:15,958
Do you hate me that day?

682
01:30:19,002 --> 01:30:20,462
No

683
01:30:24,341 --> 01:30:26,218

I can't repay you back

690
01:30:59,668 --> 01:31:02,337
I don't think there's chance

691
01:31:05,632 --> 01:31:07,676
I am fine

692
01:31:10,387 --> 01:31:12,264
I still have something last time

693
01:31:13,265 --> 01:31:14,641
Now nothing

694
01:31:18,896 --> 01:31:20,606
Only this hand that is left

695
01:31:31,074 --> 01:31:32,451
Do you mind?

696
01:33:52,633 --> 01:33:55,177
