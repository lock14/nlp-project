1
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,349
INSIDE
PARIS

2
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,638
No mistake.
This is an apostrophe.

3
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,155
I'm speaking to you, dear viewer.

4
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,192
But, like you, I...

5
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,716
I'm aware of
the intolerably embarrassing odour

6
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,430
of someone who dares
speak directly to the audience.

7
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,396
But I'll do it to begin this story
with an introduction.

8
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,432
What I have in mind
isn't just verbose and pedantic

9
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,954
beyond my wildest dreams...

10
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,630
Without spoiling anything,
it's also horribly personal.

11
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,918
Back to the introduction...

12
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,233
Despite the evidence, I'm not this story's hero.

13
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,510
So I'll give myself the right to be the narrator.

14
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,915
Besides,

15
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,434
that suits well my characteristic omniscience.

16
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,318
Despite the doubts confessed to you

17
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,916
by some of the young girls I know,

18
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,308
those little lovelies have no idea.

19
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,395
But I can be everywhere at once.

20
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,758
<i>Like here, in the middle of France.</i>

21
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,637
<i>A potato-shaped region.</i>

22
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,550
<i>A year ago, my brother Paul...</i>

23
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,629
<i>You saw him earlier in my bed...</i>
<i>He left the city</i>

24
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,153
<i>to move there.</i>

25
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,391
<i>He didn't go alone,</i>
<i>but with Anna and Loup.</i>

26
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,913
<i>He's Anna's son.</i>

27
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,478
<i>To justify leaving, he lamely assured me</i>

28
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,155
<i>that life would be easier</i>
<i>in the countryside than Paris.</i>

29
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,998
<i>Without a smile,</i>

30
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,117
<i>he argued he needed distance</i>
<i>between him and us.</i>

31
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,475
<i>I never mentioned his confession.</i>

32
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,675
<i>I should have.</i>

33
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,077
<i>I should have stopped him.</i>

34
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,276
I never should have let Paul go
without begging him to stay.

35
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,311
If I had stopped him,
the rest wouldn't have happened.

36
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,158
I'll shut up now.

37
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,549
This is an intro, not a guided tour.

38
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,836
I'll turn back into a character
who doesn't know you nor the plot.

39
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,309
That small privilege is my right.

40
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,151
Just one last question...

41
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,676
Maybe your viewing experience
outdoes what I've already lived.

42
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,673
Is it really possible

43
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,273
for a love story to make us jump off a bridge?

44
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,634
Wow!

45
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,676
Looks like a serious event.

46
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,715
Not really.

47
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,198
White shirt!

48
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,829
What's with your new craze?

49
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,797
Showering immediately after?

50
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,314
Anna, I don't have time to fight.

51
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,438
Sorry. Did I hurt you?

52
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,318
Leave me alone, asshole. Get dressed.

53
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,112
I'll tell you why you shower.

54
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,074
Three reasons.

55
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,668
First, so I see it tires you out.

56
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,915
You only fuck me for nostalgia's sake.

57
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,036
Your twisted way of being faithful.
To what, I don't know.

58
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,953
That's all I am in your eyes, an old memory.

59
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,235
- Second reason.
- Shut up.

60
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,719
Get dressed.

61
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,119
Second reason.

62
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,794
You don't want to offend me, contradict me.

63
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,236
Coward! You'd rather fuck me
than admit you don't want me.

64
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,910
Love me too much to hurt me, is that it?

65
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,513
Your love is more about loyalty to the past.

66
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,199
The idea of hurting me terrorises you.

67
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,508
Are you listening?

68
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,874
It terrorises you!

69
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,234
Third reason.

70
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,595
<i>You shower because you hope I will.</i>

71
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,835
<i>You don't dare tell me I stink,</i>
<i>my odours disgust you.</i>

72
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,949
<i>You run to the shower, praying I'll follow you,</i>

73
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,352
praying I'll lather up.

74
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,158
Seriously, Anna, I have to go.

75
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,277
I'm speaking seriously.

76
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,078
I've never been more serious.

77
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,037
What are you after?

78
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,115
I'm after a reason for your inelegance.

79
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,113
Despite your nice white shirts
with their impeccably ironed collars,

80
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,633
you're about as elegant as a pile of shit,
sweetheart.

81
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,709
It's cruel to act like you made a mistake.

82
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,872
Like you can't stay in bed.
Like you must shower.

83
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,472
Like "What have I done?"

84
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,111
Like "Sorry I ever fucked you."

85
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,394
What are you saying?

86
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,398
You're forcing yourself, Paul.

87
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,590
I won't hear this right now.

88
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,958
But you will.

89
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,836
You expect me to speak for you,

90
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,756
to destroy everything, then leave.

91
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,154
Well, fine.

92
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,472
I'm ready to destroy everything.

93
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,995
No need to get out.
I'll say goodbye here.

94
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,910
- I'll call you from Paris.
- When are you back?

95
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,673
Three, four days.
By Saturday, for sure.

96
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,311
I could drive you and sleep at Dad's.

97
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,960
And Loup? I'd rather you stay with him.

98
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,395
Fuck you.

99
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,429
Bye, Loup!

100
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,075
I'll be back.

101
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,312
- Need a light?
- Yes, thanks.

102
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,833
So we're out of love?

103
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,514
Yes, Paul. We are.

104
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,551
"I don't know what's happening.

105
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,631
"I don't trust myself when I'm in love.

106
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,631
"I get nervous. I say the wrong things.

107
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,508
"Or I start examining, evaluating,
calculating what I say.

108
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,876
"I say 'Think it will rain? '
She responds 'I don't know.'

109
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,030
"Then I wonder if she's even interested.

110
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,429
"It all scares me to death!"

111
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,794
Wait!

112
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,597
"Yes, scared to death!

113
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,428
"A friend once told me

114
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,796
"having a fuck buddy
is better than falling in love.

115
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,949
"I think he's right.

116
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,874
"Rain makes flowers grow and snails happy.

117
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,838
"That's a fact, but...

118
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,038
"But if a girl loves me,
and she starts acting strangely...

119
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,270
"Like asking me funny questions,

120
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,476
"and pouting when I snap at her.

121
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,870
"Or saying things like 'Think it will rain? '

122
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,393
"And I say 'I have no idea'

123
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,114
"and she says 'oh'

124
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,829
"and gets all sad looking up
at the California-blue sky.

125
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,117
"That makes me thank God it's you, darling.

126
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,997
"This time it's your turn."

127
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,589
How are you?

128
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,671
You look good. You seem happy.

129
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,428
For me?

130
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,675
I don't know.

131
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,558
Yes, they're for me. Thanks, darling.

132
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,398
Eight at the audition.

133
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,598
The guys from the ad agency,

134
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,112
the clients, the salesmen...

135
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,478
They all seemed enthusiastic.

136
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,278
Don't lie about your lovers.

137
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,875
An exclusive deal would set me up for a year.

138
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,871
Don't lie about your lovers!

139
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,279
I was at Cecile's.

140
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,951
I forgot my phone charger.

141
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,232
Call her and check.

142
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,713
I'm going to bed.

143
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,788
Don't stay up too late.

144
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,114
Get in!

145
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,070
We can't stay here all day. Get in!

146
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,549
Listen to this:

147
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,156
"How nice to wake up alone in the morning

148
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,959
"without having to tell anyone you love them...

149
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,678
"when you don't any more!"

150
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,756
"How nice to wake up alone in the morning

151
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,070
"without having to tell anyone you love them

152
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,593
"when you don't any more!"

153
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,475
What are...

154
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,514
Is that what you want?

155
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,075
Is that it?

156
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,479
Proud of yourself?

157
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,433
Are you proud?

158
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,316
That's what you wanted, right?

159
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,117
- Right?
- You're drunk!

160
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,599
I'm not drunk.

161
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,032
Believe I'm drunk, if you want.

162
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,710
But I can drink litres and not get drunk.

163
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,313
For us, I won't be drunk.

164
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,634
- I have all my wits about me.
- Good for you!

165
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,349
I know it, I do. You know nothing!

166
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,953
You've always been strong.

167
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,557
Proud to not fuck the woman who loves you?

168
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,914
You love me?

169
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,315
Being loved
doesn't mean everything's fine.

170
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,631
That doesn't mean you're mine
and I'm yours.

171
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,719
What are you saying?

172
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,789
Yes!

173
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,678
A baby? That's so stupid!

174
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,753
You didn't care enough.

175
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,070
Loving someone doesn't mean
giving them a baby.

176
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,798
You didn't care enough.

177
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,756
How mean to bring that up!
It's not about a baby.

178
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,354
You didn't care enough.
Loup was enough for you.

179
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,998
You can't say that!

180
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,593
You never brought it up.

181
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,640
And you? Don't you have a mouth?

182
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,830
You couldn't ask me to have a baby?

183
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,114
It was beyond you to say
"Have my baby."

184
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,558
I love you.

185
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,675
I know.

186
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,079
I know you love me.

187
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,711
That's the difference between us.

188
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,358
How can you know I love you?
How can you be sure?

189
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,391
In the beginning,
before I followed you into this hole...

190
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,314
Our first days, I lulled myself to sleep
repeating "Paul loves me".

191
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,630
I said it out loud, hundreds of times,
like a prayer.

192
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,395
Meaningless words.
We hardly knew each other.

193
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,075
But something came about,
something was established.

194
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,358
I believed you loved me.
I had faith in your love.

195
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,550
This belief never left me.

196
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,669
We can pray to be loved by only one person.

197
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,716
It's not the worst way to save the soul.

198
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,550
You never prayed for me to love you.

199
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,071
You never needed my love.

200
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,918
Dad, what are you doing?

201
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,233
It's already 8, son. Want some coffee?

202
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,919
I'm sleeping. Don't wake me.

203
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,870
Healthy, refreshing sleep happens
before midnight.

204
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,030
Know what time you went to bed?

205
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,398
No, please! I can't stand that.

206
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,913
Can't stand what?

207
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,913
I hope you don't stay up counting the minutes
till I get home!

208
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,836
No one's counting minutes.

209
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,114
Smart-ass!

210
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,915
Dad!

211
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,871
- You're staying?
- Just ignore me.

212
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,837
But you're in my bed!

213
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,876
Where am I supposed to watch TV?

214
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,599
This can't be!

215
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,639
I had to give up my bedroom.
The living room is my space!

216
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,878
- We'll put the TV in your room.
- Don't move it.

217
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,949
Dad!

218
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,636
Did you speak to your brother today?

219
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,196
How? You're talking crazy!

220
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,279
Lower your voice.

221
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,999
I couldn't possibly have talked to him.
I got home late, as you know.

222
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,873
You promised me you'd talk to him.

223
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,439
Don't be selfish, Jonathan.
I hate that attitude.

224
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,432
I couldn't talk to him! I just told you.

225
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,834
Paul doesn't even want to talk to us.

226
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,589
Come on, Dad. I want to sleep.

227
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,669
I'm asking you nicely to go away.

228
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,557
You'll set the bed on fire!

229
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,993
Go away!

230
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,190
- Do you have class today?
- Yes.

231
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,918
- What time?
- At noon.

232
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,998
Then you'll help me with grocery shopping.

233
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,230
Tomorrow's Saturday. Too many people.

234
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,117
Yeah, we'll see.

235
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,474
Now I'm sleeping.

236
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,312
I called your mother

237
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,909
when I woke up.

238
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,828
Always the same!

239
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,431
Not even an answering machine!

240
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,629
I can never reach her in such moments.

241
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,470
How is Paul such a moment?

242
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,514
You're stupid!

243
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,151
You want coffee or not?

244
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,992
Drink it before it gets cold.

245
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,111
- You want it or not?
- Yeah, coffee!

246
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,158
Thanks, Dad! You know me so well.

247
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,596
How can you always grant my every wish?
Thanks, Dad!

248
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,793
Your breath stinks.

249
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,990
I'd better call the dentist for you.

250
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,592
Must be something stuck in there.
Let me see.

251
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,910
Open your mouth. Open!

252
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,798
Go away! Leave me alone!
Go away, go!

253
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,837
I'll go only when you tell me
what you'll do for your brother?

254
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,311
I'm going to let him live out
his depression in peace.

255
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,958
Very funny.

256
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,073
I'll fight to stop you from ruining everything.

257
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,037
You're incapable of feeling
the slightest pity for anyone.

258
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,473
Not even your brother.

259
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,515
You want me to pity Paul?

260
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,795
- I didn't say that.
- Yes, you did! You said it.

261
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,440
That's enough! Enough aggravation
for one day!

262
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,558
Good one! Very impressive.

263
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,874
Look at you! Sleeping naked in winter!

264
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,469
Wear a t-shirt if not pyjamas.

265
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,349
Already up?

266
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,078
You've been yelling.

267
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,674
Not my fault. Tell it to Dad.

268
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,752
Did you sleep well?

269
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,717
Have you ever slept on that couch from hell?

270
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,677
It has fleas. I got bit!

271
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,836
That's called getting fat!

272
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,879
And that's called needing a haircut!

273
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,868
What's wrong, Paul?

274
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,389
Nothing.

275
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,590
- Do you feel sick?
- Jo, I'm on the toilet.

276
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,954
Sorry.

277
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,832
Shit! That's cold!

278
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,839
That's bitter cold.

279
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,798
Sleep well, dear?

280
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,674
You weren't too hot?

281
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,591
Those idiots put the heat all the way up.

282
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,069
I was dying.

283
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,949
I had to turn it off in my room.

284
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,395
We can here too, if you want.

285
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,674
No, that's OK.

286
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,438
What do you want for lunch?

287
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,116
I don't know. I'm not hungry.
Don't worry about me.

288
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,270
I'm going shopping with your brother.

289
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,351
They do fish downstairs now.

290
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,513
I'll get some sole. You still like that?

291
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,989
Yes, but forget it.
I'm really not hungry.

292
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,278
I'll make chicken soup.

293
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:03,199
I wanted to make some yesterday,
but I didn't have the little cubes.

294
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,508
I'll make you a pot.

295
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,919
You can have it when you like.

296
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,839
Have you seen my underwear?

297
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,029
What a mood!

298
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,920
Chicken soup is really good when you're sick.

299
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,031
Your brother is an idiot!

300
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,913
It's nourishing and makes you sweat.

301
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,912
Refuse it. Our childhood was traumatised
by chicken soup.

302
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,672
Don't eat it any more!

303
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,953
Go ahead and complain! Both of you.

304
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,837
Dad, I'm not sick.

305
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,597
You haven't eaten in two days.

306
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,874
I'm just not hungry.

307
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,995
Got it?

308
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,554
I'm going.

309
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,200
- You guys have a lot to talk about.
- That's it.

310
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,669
Bon appétit!

311
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,511
I told you he gets delirious.

312
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,431
You don't know. But I do.

313
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,714
He was always a pain.

314
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,510
But he can't control his mood.
And he forgets things.

315
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,919
I'll be careful.

316
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,555
Get dressed!

317
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,875
No.

318
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,472
Come on! Let's go to Paris.

319
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,192
Why should I go to Paris?

320
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,356
Let's see the Bon Marché windows.

321
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,714
Come on.

322
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,917
At Christmas, you always took me
to see the Bon Marché windows.

323
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,557
I don't have the energy.

324
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,952
I know! We can go to Galeries.

325
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,549
That's even further.

326
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,949
Bon Marché is only 20 minutes away.

327
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,954
- Don't play with me.
- Listen, you don't know.

328
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,077
A year away from Paris
and you forgot distances.

329
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,639
A half-hour max.

330
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,511
Make it to Bon Marché in a half-hour,
and I swear I'll go meet you.

331
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,715
Swear?

332
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,794
Yes, but you can't do it.

333
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,992
I can and I will.

334
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,675
It's 9:36. I'll be there at 10:06.

335
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,752
Right, if you take the Metro.

336
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,469
Yeah, right. I walk!
I'll call you and send photos.

337
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,949
- Does your phone receive photos?
- Stop being stupid.

338
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,589
It's 9:36. I'll be there at 10:06.

339
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,238
You'll have to meet me. Go!

340
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,355
Stay here.

341
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,592
Let it be clear it's out of the question
for you to die today.

342
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,719
Where are you going?

343
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,797
I'm waiting on you to go shopping.

344
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,395
I didn't slam the door like that!
It wasn't that hard.

345
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,913
Where are you going?

346
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,877
I need you for the groceries.

347
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,355
That's better.

348
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,717
From the day I understood the value
of different coins,

349
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,360
I was entrusted with the coat of arms

350
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,590
with this embroidered motto:

351
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,958
"Take time to ignore the sadness
of your family."

352
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,953
Every lineage has its great quality.
Ours is detachment.

353
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,793
It's also our handicap.

354
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,036
<i>You'll note that limping is how</i>
<i>I got down the street that morning.</i>

355
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,235
Hi!

356
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,153
Yes, it's me.

357
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:59,153
No kidding, I'm already at Beaugrenelle.
I'm at the bridge.

358
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,438
I'm hopping on one foot.
I'll get there early. Hurry!

359
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,239
Get dressed, man. I'm waiting.

360
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,234
Your brother is really messing up.

361
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,788
He had a class at noon.
He took nothing with him.

362
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,632
I'm in love with Anna.

363
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,159
I'm in love with Anna.

364
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,560
FRIDAY, DECEMBER 23

365
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,153
Move!

366
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,151
I have the right of way!

367
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,029
Hello, are you Paul?

368
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:18,159
I'm calling on behalf of Jonathan.
He says stop the clock.

369
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,674
- He has been kidnapped.
- Paul, I'll call later.

370
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,159
He said he'll call later.

371
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,198
- He hung up.
- That's normal, he's depressed.

372
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,957
I swear, I'm next to Dad's.
I just left her place.

373
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,315
I won't look back.
She must be watching.

374
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,628
You want details?

375
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,554
Man, it's clear I already hit
the high point of my day.

376
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,230
<i>Limited time rushed me.</i>

377
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,510
<i>Good direction of operations,</i>

378
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,398
<i>stripping on command,</i>
<i>mischievous little pose,</i>

379
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,550
<i>a little slap on the derriere,</i>
<i>and sword straight up.</i>

380
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,392
<i>Very nice to unveil herl</i>

381
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,512
<i>After, she didn't stop talking.</i>

382
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,478
<i>Said she's married. She has a little girl.</i>

383
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,959
<i>She told me I was really cute.</i>

384
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,473
<i>That's what she said.</i>

385
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,113
Of course, I'll make it.

386
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,034
Great marathon runners sprint till the end.

387
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,399
Don't tell Dad, OK?

388
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,357
He'll bitch me out for weeks.
Call you later.

389
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,713
Shit!

390
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,069
- What are you doing here?
- I came to kiss you.

391
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,032
Which one do you want?

392
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,039
Whatever. Big, small.

393
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,829
Take 5 minutes to help me carry it.
I can't do it alone.

394
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,717
No, I can't help you.

395
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,554
The little ones are too little.
Stingy for Christmas.

396
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,198
Who cares about your tree!

397
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,116
No one can count on you!

398
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,869
Sorry.

399
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,950
Paul? Come help me.

400
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,953
Paul, come help me!

401
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,910
Paul, it's Jo.

402
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,230
I ran into a girlfriend.

403
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,959
I'm in deep shit, man.
I'll call you later.

404
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,634
I'm taking a little break. Don't go to sleep!

405
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,517
I swear you'll see the windows.

406
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,113
Big kiss. OK?

407
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,869
Glad to see you!

408
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,871
Don't make me laugh. You ran away from me.

409
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,872
No! Things aren't always as they seem.

410
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,359
Yeah, right.

411
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,953
Can I explain?

412
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,678
Don't bother.

413
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,993
I want my money, that's all.
I'm sick of your stories.

414
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,552
If you want to be mean, you succeeded.

415
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,312
You're expecting scruples?

416
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,755
You owe me 3000 euros. Should I apologise?

417
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,832
It's not 3000, and I won't give them to you.

418
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,558
Disgusting! You owe even more.

419
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,835
Alice! Weren't we together?

420
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,039
That means I had to support you?

421
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,951
We can't talk if you use that tone.

422
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,271
I don't want to talk to you!
I just want my money.

423
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,750
If I hadn't broken up,
you'd never ask me for the money.

424
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,593
I broke it off. It was my decision.

425
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,432
And it wasn't about money.

426
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,709
Then why?

427
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,079
Because you stink.

428
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,869
You're dirty.

429
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:10,151
You fuck dirty.
You always smell of sweat or piss.

430
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,231
Kissing you is hellish.

431
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,038
- You're joking.
- No.

432
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,951
So why stay with me for six months?

433
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,835
- I was in love with you.
- Despite everything!

434
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,911
Despite everything.

435
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,232
We can fall in love with pigs.

436
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,912
Listen to yourself!

437
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,991
I won't stop till I get my money.

438
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,718
I don't have 3000 euros.

439
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,109
I don't care. Go get it.

440
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,519
I don't have an ATM card.

441
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,878
Call your father.

442
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,110
- Are you crazy?
- Find a way.

443
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,192
I wasn't not going to pay you back.
Just not today.

444
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,429
Yes, today!

445
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,149
OK! What do you want me to do?
Rob a store?

446
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,597
Or dream on the scene, jelly bean,
in a limousine like Jimmy Dean?

447
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,432
- Come on!
- Leave me alone.

448
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,990
What's this new role about?
"Leave me alone!"

449
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,548
Come on! I won't touch you.

450
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,477
I'll just hug you.

451
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,035
See?

452
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,118
That's not so bad.

453
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,511
Why get all upset?

454
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,313
Don't we deserve better?

455
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,519
Invite me to lunch?

456
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,919
Idiot!

457
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,513
- Don't let me go.
- Out of the question.

458
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,672
<i>No, not here.</i>

459
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:41,276
<i>Why not? No one's here.</i>
<i>Everyone's working.</i>

460
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,516
<i>Hello, Missl How are you?</i>

461
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,194
<i>Why not?</i>

462
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,913
<i>Here, I really can't.</i>

463
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,035
<i>See?</i>

464
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,590
- <i>Then let's go to your place.</i>
- <i>My mother would kill you.</i>

465
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,432
<i>What did you tell your mother?</i>

466
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,635
<i>The truth.</i>

467
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,599
<i>You're really tough.</i>

468
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,716
<i>Yeah, right. Really tough.</i>

469
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,189
- <i>What are you doing?</i>
- <i>Let's not stay here.</i>

470
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,633
<i>I'll buy you lunch.</i>

471
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,353
- <i>You dress like me.</i>
- <i>What?</i>

472
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,555
<i>The scarf.</i>

473
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,108
<i>You're not the only Parisian with a scarf.</i>

474
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,156
<i>How mad you getl</i>

475
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,275
Paul!

476
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,314
Time to eat!

477
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,839
Time to eat!

478
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,550
It's ready, son. Are you coming?

479
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,153
I told you I wasn't hungry.

480
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,119
But I got you a sole.

481
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,477
Stop bugging me.

482
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,348
Enough, Paul! Come and eat!
Staying in bed isn't healthy.

483
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,077
I don't want to eat. I'm not hungry.

484
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,712
Don't be ridiculous.
I just cooked it. It'll get cold.

485
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,836
I won't eat your sole.
You eat it.

486
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,113
I can bring it to you.

487
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,432
Be nice, leave me in peace!

488
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,430
Around the holidays, sole is expensive.

489
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,636
Make me happy. Come and eat.

490
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,199
Then you can go back to bed.

491
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,039
Shit!

492
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,077
What's wrong?

493
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,912
What's wrong with you, son?

494
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,752
What's wrong with you?

495
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,477
What's wrong with you?

496
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,753
Nothing.

497
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,558
Don't worry. It's nothing.

498
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,311
I'm just tired.

499
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,674
I'll come eat.

500
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,154
I'll come eat.

501
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,956
Remember our first time here?

502
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,195
No?

503
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,750
After we went out for crepes.

504
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,910
You said you always eat crepes
after making love.

505
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,309
We walked a long time in the rain

506
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,992
before finding a creperie.

507
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,113
We were soaking wet,
but we walked slowly, I remember.

508
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,598
I talked to you about love.

509
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,917
You talked about umbrellas.

510
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,308
Yes, yes. I remember very well.

511
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,676
I don't want to go back to you.

512
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:16,230
It's OK. I know you're not in love with me.

513
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,638
I don't know what to say, Alice.

514
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,038
I have to call my brother.

515
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,797
Plus, your mother's coming home.

516
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,873
As soon as you leave,
things will be shitty again.

517
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,075
Why shitty?

518
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,555
- My shitty life.
- Stop pressuring me!

519
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:47,792
You're not the only shit in my life.
Just a small part.

520
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,916
You're right! Just don't say it!

521
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,831
Don't start. I'm not in the mood.

522
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,909
Sorry.

523
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,959
When will I see you again?

524
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,632
Your decision, princess.

525
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,750
You want to see me again? Sincerely?

526
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,676
If you assure me it's good for you, OK.

527
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,749
OK.

528
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,829
But here is too complicated.
I don't want my mother to know.

529
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,751
We'll go to my house.

530
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,035
Sure?

531
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,713
It's you who won't come
to my neighbourhood!

532
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,869
I'll come.

533
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,955
Alice, it's 4. I have to go.

534
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,870
I'll come, hear me?

535
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,678
- What?
- I'll come!

536
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,115
Yes, you'll come.
You'll be most welcome.

537
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,794
I believe you. Do what you want.
No need to explain.

538
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,757
It's 4:40. It took you seven hours
to go to Bon Marché!

539
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,955
That's good!

540
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,558
Very good.

541
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,471
Yeah, if you want.

542
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,838
OK, in 15 minutes.

543
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,470
Your brother missed class today?

544
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,076
That's the last time I pay his tuition.

545
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,832
Next year, he's on his own.

546
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,672
I won't be taken for a fool.

547
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,992
He'll have to ask his mother

548
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,714
to pay for his studies.

549
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:54,755
Don't stay out in bare feet. You'll catch a chill.

550
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,316
Come in, Paul. We'll decorate the tree.

551
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,909
It's been a long time since we've had a tree.

552
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,150
Not since Claire died.

553
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,639
You're right.

554
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,949
12 years.

555
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,152
I don't keep track of such anniversaries.

556
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,908
Sorry.

557
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,154
It's not forbidden to talk about your sister.

558
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,071
I never forbid anyone.

559
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,239
Don't get mad.

560
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,028
I'm not mad.

561
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,349
You're always accusing me of something.

562
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,750
Your brother probably forgot his key.

563
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,509
Oh, it's you.

564
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,075
Is he there?

565
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,348
I knew your father was exaggerating.

566
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,749
You don't look like you're dying.

567
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,149
I'm happy to see you, sweetie.

568
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,519
How handsome you are!

569
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,879
More and more handsome.

570
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,712
You got a tree!

571
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,391
The three of us together for Christmas.

572
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,715
A way of telling me I'm not invited.

573
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,751
Your father's as elegant as ever.

574
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:15,596
So, tell me. You gave up on the provinces?

575
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,716
I don't know yet. For now, I'm here.

576
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,711
Didn't I warn you it turns you mad?

577
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:26,352
You wanted to prove God knows what.
But country life isn't for us.

578
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,635
Don't be silly. Want some coffee?

579
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,870
I'm not silly.
Playing farmer like that!

580
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,355
I didn't go to become a farmer.

581
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,668
I know.

582
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,315
So?

583
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,388
Tell me.

584
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,519
You have heartaches?

585
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,593
No.

586
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,319
Your dad told me she left.
Don't lie.

587
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,277
I don't want to talk to you about this.

588
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,153
Nothing to say?
Then I'm here for nothing.

589
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,668
Bravo!

590
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,954
Really!

591
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,598
Perfect!

592
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,118
It's easy not to answer!
I made it, I'm here.

593
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,633
The lights are beautiful!

594
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,553
Come on, I'm waiting for you.
Put on your cap and mittens.

595
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,870
OK, brother? Big kiss.

596
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,070
Oh, it's you. Where are you?

597
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,838
No, I can't pass him to you.

598
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,759
No, Jonathan!

599
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,999
I said no.

600
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,631
We're fine, just fine.

601
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:38,915
Idiots!

602
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,632
Can I possibly kiss you?
It's a question of life or death.

603
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,229
Go on.

604
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,674
That's nifty.

605
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:00,432
Nifty? No one says nifty any more.

606
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,749
What should I say?

607
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,192
I don't know.

608
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,474
For nifty?

609
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:09,518
You could say cool, good,

610
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,909
hot, kick-ass, the bomb.

611
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,470
Or even groovy.

612
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,236
- Did he tell you anything?
- No.

613
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,038
I tried hard, though.

614
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:50,112
He wouldn't tell me anything either.

615
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,718
He doesn't want to talk to us.

616
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,668
He said that?

617
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,629
He said the only person he wants
to talk to is Claire.

618
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,154
Want to eat?

619
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,239
No, I should go back.

620
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:13,312
That's a big tree.

621
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,670
Earlier, I thought he would
jump off the balcony.

622
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,318
Don't exaggerate.

623
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,311
I'm not.

624
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,155
Is it normal your son
wants to talk to his dead sister?

625
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,473
He said nothing to Jonathan?

626
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:37,593
Jonathan should question him first.

627
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,831
He's getting more and more selfish.
That kid's getting worse and worse.

628
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,596
Complain about your son. Go on.

629
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,875
You only see him once a month.
Easy for you!

630
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,270
Must we argue, Mirko?
You really want to fight?

631
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,078
No, I don't!

632
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,875
Here's your coffee, dear.

633
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,436
I think he should see someone.

634
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,832
Maybe start on meds.

635
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,114
You want to drug him.

636
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,191
That's it. Exactly.

637
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,872
I want to drug my son.

638
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,677
There are other ways to get well
besides tranquilizers.

639
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,436
Happiness can be found not only through pills.

640
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,477
I want to call Anna.

641
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,430
That's the last thing you should do.

642
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,914
Paul's heart is too fragile.

643
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,318
He's like his father.

644
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,958
Oh Mirko, please!

645
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,792
Think what you want, but it's true.

646
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:41,030
I think your heart's healthy.

647
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,910
I'm worried about your brain.

648
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,989
Did you see the neurologist again?

649
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,593
I'm sure Anna has the answer.

650
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,717
Maybe something bad happened.

651
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:58,554
The answer to what?
It's just you're all so closed.

652
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,756
None of you listen to the questions!

653
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:05,632
Paul acts like his father.
He thinks no one can help.

654
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,073
I don't need a neurologist.

655
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,754
And Paul doesn't need your help to get better!

656
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,234
See how stupid that sounds?

657
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,668
Fine!

658
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:24,392
Don't make yourself sick.
You're not the worst of fathers.

659
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,959
What's for dinner?

660
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,308
Chicken soup.

661
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,833
How festive!

662
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,430
I'll have some with you.

663
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,359
If your invitation still stands?

664
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,192
Money problems at the moment?

665
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,679
Why do you ask?

666
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,079
I don't know.

667
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,718
Because of the chicken soup.

668
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,474
I'm fine.

669
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,912
We can help, you know.

670
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,871
I'm sure you can't hold out long.

671
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,155
All three of you on your pension.

672
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,879
Your guy already supports you.

673
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,235
Must he pay for your ex-husband, too?

674
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,073
Brilliant!

675
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,719
You brought up money.
You brought it up!

676
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:27,156
I brought it up because you're in the shithouse.

677
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,515
Don't say shit so much!

678
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,357
That's not very elegant.

679
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,633
You're so stupid!

680
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,593
Really stupid.

681
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,233
Mum!

682
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,351
- Did she leave?
- Yes.

683
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,629
Did you fight?

684
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,234
The usual.

685
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,073
Where's the TV guide?

686
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:37,429
On the table, or maybe your brother
took it to the toilet.

687
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,151
Forty Gun on cable?

688
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,674
Yeah, sure.

689
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:57,273
You know, I didn't want to jump
off the balcony earlier.

690
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:00,033
I saw you thought I wanted to, but I didn't.

691
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,315
I was looking at my phone that fell.

692
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:11,757
Listen to me and don't interrupt.
Can you do that?

693
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:14,195
- Do what?
- Keeping quiet.

694
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,350
Say what you have to say!

695
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,439
Last night, at around 4 in the morning,
I got up and left the apartment.

696
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,839
- What?
- Dad!

697
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,151
So I went out.

698
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,997
I was wearing Jonathan's clothes.

699
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,832
<i>And his shoes too.</i>

700
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,716
PARIS STUDENT ID

701
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,438
I don't know how I got back.

702
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,873
Or how long it took.

703
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,073
I suddenly saw the building,

704
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,717
then the apartment door.

705
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:40,436
I undressed in the bathroom.
Then I ran the hot water.

706
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:41,999
Did you tell your brother?

707
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,198
Did you tell your brother?

708
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,550
Are you under the influence of alcohol?

709
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,275
What?

710
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,473
What is it, Paul?

711
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:19,829
What is it?

712
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,399
Paul, what's wrong?

713
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,511
What are you looking at?
What is it?

714
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,672
What is it? Look at me!

715
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,358
But did you tell him?

716
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,477
Yes, of course. He was there.
I couldn't not tell him.

717
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:54,595
What did he say?

718
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,240
He said if I do that again, he'll punch me out.

719
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,717
For once, I agree with him.

720
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,479
What is it?

721
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,471
Remember me? I'm Alice.

722
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,949
- Jonathan told me to drop by.
- He's not back yet.

723
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,268
When will he be back?

724
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:21,510
Lmpossible to know.

725
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:22,749
He asked me to...

726
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,910
Then come in!
Wait in here.

727
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,229
This way.

728
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,793
Have a seat on the couch. Watch TV.

729
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,269
Excuse me.

730
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:38,912
What the hell are you doing?

731
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,592
Hungry? There's chicken soup.

732
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,710
- Is this a joke?
- I'm going to bed.

733
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,071
Sit on the couch!

734
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,399
Wait, wait!

735
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,596
Hitting me wasn't very nice.

736
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,159
You're crazy!

737
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:06,476
Don't leave me with her.
Who is she?

738
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,039
Ask your brother.

739
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,155
Good night.

740
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:30,434
Good night!

741
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,597
Is my brother an asshole?

742
01:06:58,840 --> 01:06:59,955
I see.

743
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,034
We can talk bad about him,
so you'll feel better.

744
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,279
Or talk nicely?

745
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,469
No?

746
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,112
Not talk about him at all?

747
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:13,948
Keep quiet?

748
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,354
Not that either?

749
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,392
What should we talk about?

750
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:32,433
I'm not the best conversationalist
these past few days.

751
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:42,549
However...

752
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,758
It's coming back some.

753
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,550
But barely an hour ago.

754
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:51,595
Above all...

755
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,671
I won't hold out long alone.

756
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:04,035
In this house, it's rare to not be interrupted.

757
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:05,758
I lost the habit.

758
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:31,115
Jon surely told you about our sister Claire.

759
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,155
No?

760
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,309
Don't be mad at him.
Certain silences can be wise.

761
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:46,439
Anyway, we had a sister, Claire.

762
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:52,033
I remember, once or twice a month

763
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:57,069
she spent the whole day sobbing,
her nose in a tissue.

764
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,754
Nothing could draw her away from heartache.

765
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:03,674
Not the best jokes,
nor the biggest confessions.

766
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,830
Attempts to distract her were in vain.

767
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:09,879
That's because she cried
for absolutely no reason.

768
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:11,757
She said it herself.

769
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,717
A very old sorrow,

770
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:17,911
so old she probably felt it the first time

771
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,513
in a previous life...

772
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,235
In the Middle Ages or in the times of idle kings.

773
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:36,719
Ever since, you see

774
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:41,550
this sadness kept coming back regularly.

775
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:45,789
Impossible for Claire to escape it. Useless.

776
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,757
She called them the blubbering days.

777
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:51,359
She welcomed with laughter, like cousins.

778
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,598
Her eyes stayed moist.

779
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:01,159
I could have strangled her those days,
not being able to help her.

780
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,197
I felt so humiliated.

781
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:12,071
Like she was testing my helplessness
against others' suffering.

782
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,276
So she cried to make you mad?

783
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,631
It wasn't against me.

784
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,312
She just cried.

785
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,436
Like a Buddha or some divinity.

786
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,798
It's impossible for others to admit
being able to cry that way.

787
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:31,639
With that smile.

788
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,998
Then Claire killed herself when she was 17.

789
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,590
Everyone was so surprised.

790
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:56,435
I swear...

791
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,918
Before heartache,
astonishment reigned in our home.

792
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,320
My sister was beautiful and happy.

793
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:15,069
Everything with her happened in communion...

794
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,629
Know what I mean?

795
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:21,359
She shared everything.

796
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,356
Yes, her blubbering days...

797
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:40,832
I think those very old sorrows killed her.

798
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:46,592
I think we grossly underestimate
our sorrow, in general.

799
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:54,076
We always die of sadness, actually.

800
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,309
You...

801
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:04,189
You mean sadness is put inside us at birth?

802
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,235
Yes.

803
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,197
Like eye colour?

804
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,148
Exactly.

805
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,271
That's why it needs our care.

806
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,559
But others can do nothing.

807
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,552
No one can do anything about eye colour.

808
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:27,396
Also, I think it would be fair

809
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:30,040
to let you take care of your sorrow alone.

810
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,472
Will you wait all night for my brother?

811
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,549
Yes.

812
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:39,789
I think.

813
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,909
Excuse me, I'm taking the phone.
I broke my mobile.

814
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,069
Good night.

815
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:38,236
Did you know, my darling

816
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:41,310
The most brilliant loves tarnish

817
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,714
The day's dirty sun in the day

818
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,791
Subjects them to torment

819
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:53,352
I have an irrefutable idea

820
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:57,310
To avoid the unbearable

821
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:01,029
Before the hatred
Before the blows

822
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,470
Of hissing or lashing

823
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,030
Before the sorrow
And the disgust

824
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:10,993
Let's break up now, please

825
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:15,551
No. I kiss you and it passes

826
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,039
You can see

827
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,635
You can't brush me off like that

828
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:30,989
You thought you'd be able to

829
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:33,676
By leaving me hanging

830
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:38,115
From the mighty love which must die

831
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,949
But you see I prefer

832
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:45,076
The inescapable storms

833
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:48,596
To your measly little idea

834
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,238
Before the hatred

835
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,276
Before the blows

836
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,711
Of hissing or lashing

837
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,518
Before the sorrow

838
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,397
And the disgust

839
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:02,398
Let's break up now, you say

840
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:06,632
But you kiss me and it passes

841
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,438
I can see

842
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,035
You're not brushed off like that

843
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:22,310
I could avoid you at the worst

844
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,756
But the best is yet to come

845
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,592
Before the hatred

846
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:29,636
Before the blows

847
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,951
Of hissing and lashing

848
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,837
Before the sorrow

849
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,672
Before the disgust

850
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:39,553
Let's break up now, please

851
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:44,156
No. I kiss you and it passes

852
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,309
You can see

853
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,072
Before the hatred

854
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,435
Before the blows

855
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,357
Of hissing and lashing

856
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,192
Before the sorrow

857
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:56,157
And the disgust

858
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:58,993
Let's break up now, you say

859
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:03,676
But you kiss me and it passes

860
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,079
I can see

861
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:12,429
You're not brushed off like that

862
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,549
You can't brush me off like that

863
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,514
Kiss Loup!

864
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:58,152
You're a pain, Paul! Pick up!

865
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,389
Answer!

866
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,234
Here, you'll catch cold.

867
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:54,595
Thanks.

868
01:17:56,360 --> 01:18:00,353
Sharing a bed
is a nice and sensible family tradition.

869
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,953
Mum stopped by.

870
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,075
Oh, yeah?

871
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,638
Did she put gifts in our stockings?

872
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:06,948
Idiot.

873
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,837
She slammed the door on her way out.

874
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:13,756
I've never seen Mum leave
without slamming the door.

875
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,598
I hadn't seen that in two years.

876
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:23,119
She slammed the door
after finding out about December 23?

877
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,428
I didn't talk to her.

878
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,592
But Dad knows.

879
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,830
<i>You want to overwhelm him?</i>

880
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,115
<i>He left me no choice.</i>

881
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,237
<i>So what did the old man say?</i>

882
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,992
<i>"Moscow doesn't believe in tears"?</i>

883
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,150
<i>No, not even.</i>

884
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:51,235
<i>It was like it wasn't important.</i>

885
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:57,919
How can you remember that?
You were so little.

886
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,355
- Mum told you?
- I don't remember.

887
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:03,750
He stopped saying it.
Who knows where he picked it up.

888
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,751
The last time I heard Dad say that

889
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:10,229
was when Mum ran off
with that Canadian lumberjack.

890
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,880
- What?
- Her Canadian lumberjack.

891
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:17,000
I can still hear his voice.

892
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:19,196
"Moscow doesn't believe in tears."

893
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:24,870
He said we mustn't hold it against
our Saint Whore-of-a-Mother.

894
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,396
No life is definitive. On the contrary...

895
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,630
Nice idea to remake your life.

896
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,270
An idea that demands great courage.

897
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:36,958
About that, he was right.

898
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:41,114
Will you have the courage to remake your life?

899
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:46,752
Have mercy. Don't beat up on me. Not now.

900
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:49,149
Coming back here wasn't the best plan.

901
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:50,559
Where to go?

902
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,149
If I were you, anywhere but here.

903
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,708
But I'm not you.

904
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,279
No.

905
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,396
- My life's not yours.
- No.

906
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,152
And yours isn't mine.

907
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:05,635
Too bad.

908
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,511
Can I have some of your cheese?

909
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,192
Go ahead!

910
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,999
If you were me, you would have slept
with three girls today.

911
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:14,035
Jo...

912
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:16,511
I request you not to interrupt me.

913
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,357
I can't stand commentary.

914
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,317
You continued after the scooter girl?

915
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,792
After the scooter girl...

916
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,710
Sensational girl, between us.

917
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,837
I'll give you her address if ever you start living

918
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:33,151
outside this room which isn't even yours.

919
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,037
So, after the scooter,

920
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:38,992
I ran into that girl
who's sleeping on the couch!

921
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,797
Seeing her again took up
a good part of my afternoon.

922
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,791
If I'm loyal to you...

923
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,794
We agree tonight's about honesty...

924
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:52,633
Then I have to admit
my afternoon was not too bad.

925
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,309
Then,

926
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,233
since I committed to doing it for you
this morning,

927
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,192
I ran to the Bon Marché.

928
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:11,075
I called you to celebrate my victory,
and you had the nerve to not answer.

929
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:13,037
I got scared, I admit it.

930
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,678
Scared you'd take another dive.

931
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:22,992
Suddenly, I don't know how,
but I fell into a hospitable girl's arms.

932
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,433
Very nice breasts.

933
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:29,715
For the third time of the day,
I got kissed nicely.

934
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:34,869
Three times

935
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:37,878
I prayed for you today.

936
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,518
I shared those girls with you.

937
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,795
I prayed they'd save your soul.

938
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,634
Pig! You fuck and pretend it's for my soul.

939
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:51,312
Stop, I'm not finished!

940
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:52,515
Three times.

941
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:54,468
I believed...

942
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:58,196
that I was keeping my brother alive.

943
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:06,838
Don't panic.
A night of honesty ends at daybreak.

944
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,629
Anna prayed to be sure I loved her.

945
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:23,116
She repeated "Paul loves me" so that I would.

946
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:24,952
It was prayer, not acquisition.

947
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:27,357
Meaning when she said it,

948
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,832
she wasn't sure I loved her.

949
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:33,754
But by merely repeating it,
this truth came to be.

950
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,594
She experienced its real presence in her heart.

951
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,474
Did you have prayers for her?

952
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:46,913
No, never.

953
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:49,755
Although...

954
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:55,355
a few these last days,
but not in a disciplined manner.

955
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,908
I don't believe in her, nor her love.

956
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:01,599
I'm not like you two.

957
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,676
I don't feel capable of saving a soul.

958
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:07,673
<i>Do you think if she could,</i>

959
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:12,869
<i>Claire would move her ass up there</i>
<i>to save our souls?</i>

960
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:20,153
Yours, without a doubt.

961
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:21,673
Very clever.

962
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:22,749
Dumbass!

963
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:30,159
So, what do we do now?

964
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,117
Hug and say we love each other?

965
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:38,473
I noticed you have no books, nor CDs.

966
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:40,754
Yes, I have books...

967
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:43,669
Yeah, right!

968
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:47,756
Some classics of Mum's,
things you read in school, period.

969
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,274
"I regretfully saw you in that dreadful state

970
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:52,157
"Ready to follow the deplorable Oreste
everywhere

971
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:53,992
"Always interrupting the flow of my madness

972
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:56,753
"And finally saving myself everyday."

973
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,119
You gave it to me for Christmas.

974
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,758
Read it to me.

975
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,308
- You know it by heart!
- Read it to me.

976
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,152
I've read it to you a hundred times.

977
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:21,999
You're going to giggle.

978
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,035
No!

979
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:33,396
There was once a rabbit, Tom,
who had never met a wolf.

980
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,231
Young wolf, Loulou, had never met a rabbit.

981
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:42,155
Tom and Loulou became good friends.

982
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:45,198
Loulou grew and Tom taught him
how to play marbles, to read,

983
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,952
and to fish for eating.

984
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:51,476
Loulou taught Tom to run very fast,
faster than the other rabbits.

985
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,036
Loulou also taught Tom fear.

986
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:59,912
Sometimes they played fear-the-wolf,
sometimes they played fear-the-rabbit.

987
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:05,514
One day, Loulou scared Tom so much
that Tom ran into his burrow

988
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,397
and decided never to come out.

989
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:12,797
Tom dreamt the wolf was huge, black and red,

990
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,279
and that he ate him.

991
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:19,230
Loulou thought their friendship was over.

992
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:23,436
He went sadly into the mountains.

993
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:33,039
One night, wolves attacked Loulou,
mistaking him for a rabbit.

994
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:36,279
That night, Loulou learned fear-the-wolf.

995
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,672
Loulou went to Tom.

996
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,076
He told him that he understood.

997
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:49,276
He would never scare him again.

998
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,157
And Tom came out of his burrow.

999
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:18,754
Want a hut?

1000
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:21,277
Come inside the hut!
