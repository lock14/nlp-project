1
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:09,189
Talon 1 requesting Bitching Betty
relay Combat Control commands.

2
00:01:09,356 --> 00:01:10,774
Roger, Talon 1.

3
00:01:10,941 --> 00:01:12,401
Central Prime is transmitting...

4
00:01:12,568 --> 00:01:14,945
...encrypted satellite
auto-terrain comparison.

5
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:16,822
Talons, this is Operator.

6
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:19,283
PAYCOM has given
his final tasking orders.

7
00:01:19,783 --> 00:01:23,745
You are to proceed to target
and prosecute with precision.

8
00:01:23,912 --> 00:01:26,456
Now, remember,
you are pilots of the U.S. Navy.

9
00:01:26,623 --> 00:01:29,793
I expect nothing less
than perfection.

10
00:01:30,168 --> 00:01:32,671
Roger, skipper.
Activating tactical music.

11
00:01:32,838 --> 00:01:35,716
Countermeasure is silent party.
Talon 2, confirm.

12
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:37,593
Talon 2 confirms. Music on.

13
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:39,970
Risk assessment is
we have a clean mission status.

14
00:01:40,137 --> 00:01:41,597
Attack commencing.

15
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:54,985
Gotcha.

16
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,916
Missile lock. Missile lock.

17
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:12,669
Talon 3, there's a SAM site on
the west wall. We got birds in the air.

18
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,310
Talon 2,
the SAM site's been erased.

19
00:02:28,518 --> 00:02:30,604
Now, that's how you do it.

20
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:57,172
Talon 3, that was shit-hot!

21
00:02:57,631 --> 00:03:00,175
Talon 1, I expect
the same out of you.

22
00:03:16,024 --> 00:03:19,194
Arming Blue Ferret
for penetration detonation.

23
00:03:20,904 --> 00:03:22,698
Missile armed. Missile armed.

24
00:04:00,944 --> 00:04:03,614
Yep, 100 over 100.
That's correct.

25
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:05,866
And I can rely on these numbers?

26
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:10,579
Well, this isn't figure skating, Ray.
You either score or you don't.

27
00:04:10,746 --> 00:04:12,706
National Command Authority's
duly impressed.

28
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:14,958
They've given us the go-ahead
on phase two.

29
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,376
You know what?

30
00:04:16,543 --> 00:04:20,130
You should come to D.C. and make
the presentation to the senators.

31
00:04:20,672 --> 00:04:23,008
That's how Admiral Rickover
got things done.

32
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:25,135
Admiral. You get my meaning?

33
00:04:25,302 --> 00:04:28,180
No, I'm flattered,
but you do the lobbying.

34
00:04:28,388 --> 00:04:29,973
Politics is for politicians.

35
00:04:31,183 --> 00:04:34,019
- Captain?
- I'll get back to you.

36
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:36,480
There's Popsicles in the cooler.

37
00:04:36,688 --> 00:04:38,148
- Got any grape?
- Any grape?

38
00:04:39,524 --> 00:04:42,569
I believe there is one left,
and don't lose your dignity.

39
00:04:42,736 --> 00:04:44,071
Oh, thank you.

40
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,574
- All right, take a seat.
- Nice catch.

41
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:51,286
Talk to me. Where are the holes?
How can we improve?

42
00:04:51,453 --> 00:04:53,330
Come on. I'm not a patient man.

43
00:04:53,497 --> 00:04:56,375
Sorry, I got caught up on
that west wall. I had to pull out...

44
00:04:56,542 --> 00:04:58,877
War is a team sport.

45
00:04:59,044 --> 00:05:02,381
Those AAA sites were thick.
Gave extra time to the SAM sites.

46
00:05:02,548 --> 00:05:05,509
See, that's your answer. There really
was no room for improvement.

47
00:05:05,676 --> 00:05:08,011
Actually, what Lieutenant Wade
did was right.

48
00:05:08,178 --> 00:05:11,098
She took out their communications
and exposed their SAM sites...

49
00:05:11,265 --> 00:05:13,433
...so Henry could lay it down.
- That's what I do.

50
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,395
- I mean, it was perfect.
- "Perfect." I'll go along with that.

51
00:05:16,562 --> 00:05:20,315
Much as I hate to see that smile
of yours get any smugger.

52
00:05:20,816 --> 00:05:22,150
You blushing?

53
00:05:23,735 --> 00:05:25,195
I've got good news.

54
00:05:25,362 --> 00:05:27,614
Tell us we got a carrier,
skipper, come on.

55
00:05:27,781 --> 00:05:28,866
Affirmative.

56
00:05:29,032 --> 00:05:30,826
The USS Abraham Lincoln.

57
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:33,871
Captain's an old classmate of mine,
Dick Marshfield.

58
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:37,374
- I believe you two know each other.
- He was the captain I told you about.

59
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:41,086
- Hell of a pilot in his day.
- He's black too. He's black.

60
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:44,006
I'm also gonna be expanding
your squadron.

61
00:05:44,965 --> 00:05:47,509
On the carrier, you'll be joined
by a new wingman.

62
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:50,470
A fourth wingman?

63
00:05:50,637 --> 00:05:54,099
Wait, I thought there were only
three Talons in existence.

64
00:05:54,308 --> 00:05:57,728
What is the problem, Purcell?
You look like you been hit in the gut.

65
00:05:57,895 --> 00:06:01,273
For one, captain, we've been flying
together for a long time and it's good.

66
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,774
And four is an unlucky number.

67
00:06:04,443 --> 00:06:05,944
- Unlucky?
- It's not a prime number.

68
00:06:06,153 --> 00:06:08,530
Prime numbers can only be divided
by one or itself.

69
00:06:08,697 --> 00:06:10,199
Three is prime. The Holy Trinity.

70
00:06:10,365 --> 00:06:13,035
Thesis and antithesis come together
and form the synthesis...

71
00:06:13,202 --> 00:06:16,997
This is not a seminar on metaphysics.
This is the U.S. Navy.

72
00:06:17,206 --> 00:06:21,960
Now, we ship out Wednesday at 0500.
Dismissed.

73
00:06:22,127 --> 00:06:24,463
Okay. If he'd let me finish,
I was gonna say...

74
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:28,425
...Three's Company, Three Stooges,
Three Musketeers, three-peat...

75
00:06:28,592 --> 00:06:30,928
..."three strikes, you're out,"
"Three Times a Lady."

76
00:06:31,094 --> 00:06:32,679
- Three dimensions.
- Three blind mice.

77
00:06:32,888 --> 00:06:35,515
There's ménage à trois.
Don't forget that one.

78
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,811
To the original three.

79
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:41,647
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.

80
00:06:41,813 --> 00:06:44,066
- Cheers.
- And assorted guests.

81
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:45,400
Cheers.

82
00:07:03,001 --> 00:07:05,212
I'll be back in a second.

83
00:07:06,672 --> 00:07:08,799
I gotta go pee-pee.

84
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:10,968
That's nasty.

85
00:07:15,973 --> 00:07:18,100
At least she's potty-trained.
I'll give her that.

86
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:20,852
- Chip O'Dell.
- No way.

87
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:24,273
Yeah, it's gotta be him. Hey, Henry,
our fourth wing. It's gotta be him.

88
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:27,526
He tried to manipulate his way into
the program, but you two beat him.

89
00:07:27,693 --> 00:07:31,238
Yeah, but Becky Martinez
could fly circles around O'Dell.

90
00:07:31,405 --> 00:07:34,241
- Two out of the four are women? No.
- Hey, you never know.

91
00:07:34,408 --> 00:07:37,703
- God, you're such a chauvinist.
- Hold on, now, that's not true.

92
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:42,165
I bow down before the superiority
of the opposite sex in many respects.

93
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:43,625
But from time to time...

94
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:45,836
...I believe they should
bow down before me.

95
00:07:46,003 --> 00:07:49,298
- Oh, please.
- Kara. Kara, listen. You're different.

96
00:07:49,506 --> 00:07:51,592
- You are a singularity.
- Absolutely.

97
00:07:51,758 --> 00:07:53,510
You're a freak. Of nature.

98
00:07:53,677 --> 00:07:56,680
- Well, thank you, Henry, I think.
- You are very welcome.

99
00:07:57,222 --> 00:07:59,141
You know what I think?

100
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:02,603
Don't think. Drink.

101
00:08:47,522 --> 00:08:49,024
Have fun.

102
00:10:14,735 --> 00:10:17,029
Spectacular night, huh?

103
00:10:17,571 --> 00:10:21,200
- Dark and mysterious, sir.
- Don't you like surprises, Ben?

104
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:28,207
Well, here he comes now.

105
00:10:52,105 --> 00:10:54,608
Meet your new wingman.

106
00:11:07,496 --> 00:11:11,083
Allow me to introduce the future
of digital warfare. Tim?

107
00:11:14,711 --> 00:11:17,172
Open for Tim, please.

108
00:11:23,095 --> 00:11:26,265
Fuel, catalyzed A1 methane.

109
00:11:26,431 --> 00:11:29,101
Exoskeleton,
metal-ceramic composite.

110
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:31,520
Aeroelastic wings.

111
00:11:31,687 --> 00:11:36,316
Pulse detonation engine
with twin hybrid scramjet turbos.

112
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:40,112
EDI's sensors can pick out
a face five miles away.

113
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:44,157
So we'll take three. Drop the top
on mine, personalized license plate.

114
00:11:44,324 --> 00:11:46,451
So this is one of these
smart UCAVs.

115
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:49,955
Well, technically you could call it
an Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle.

116
00:11:50,122 --> 00:11:52,499
But that would be like
calling this carrier a rowboat.

117
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,835
I feel you, captain.
I know a bit about this.

118
00:11:55,002 --> 00:11:58,463
- This is quantum processing, right?
- Yeah, it's the first tested application.

119
00:11:58,672 --> 00:11:59,965
Ten terabits a second.

120
00:12:00,132 --> 00:12:02,676
So if it's a UCAV,
why does it have a seat?

121
00:12:02,885 --> 00:12:04,970
The cockpit's just
for testing and maintenance.

122
00:12:05,137 --> 00:12:07,347
Otherwise, EDI flies all by himself.

123
00:12:07,806 --> 00:12:10,058
You mean "itself," don't you, sir?

124
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:14,187
So this is what the fuss is all about.

125
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,816
You're looking
at VLO stealth, captain.

126
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:19,943
It's got a brain
like a quantum sponge.

127
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,906
And one day, its survivability
is going to fly right off the charts.

128
00:12:24,072 --> 00:12:26,533
- Lieutenant Wade.
- It's good to meet you, sir.

129
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:29,912
It is a bag of chips, all right.

130
00:12:31,747 --> 00:12:34,166
- Lieutenant Purcell.
- Honored to meet you, sir.

131
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,460
It will replace us all.

132
00:12:37,044 --> 00:12:39,838
Looks and sounds
like science fiction, George.

133
00:12:40,005 --> 00:12:42,090
Well, so did everything,
once upon a time.

134
00:12:42,257 --> 00:12:44,176
Ain't that the truth.

135
00:12:44,593 --> 00:12:46,595
Mr. Gannon.
Good to have you back.

136
00:12:47,262 --> 00:12:51,016
Your first squadron tour still holds
some of the ship's most...

137
00:12:51,183 --> 00:12:52,893
...impressive records.

138
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,854
Thank you, Captain Marshfield.
Records are made to be broken.

139
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:58,732
Rules too, if I remember
your philosophy.

140
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:01,610
Captain Cummings,
this is my X O, Mr. Carlson.

141
00:13:01,818 --> 00:13:03,070
Carlson.

142
00:13:03,237 --> 00:13:06,156
Why don't you meet me up on
the flight deck after you're through.

143
00:13:06,323 --> 00:13:07,908
- You bet.
- Congratulations, George.

144
00:13:08,116 --> 00:13:10,369
- Thank you.
- Good to see you again, Dick.

145
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:11,745
You too.

146
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:14,623
- It's humming.
- No, EDI's thinking.

147
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:18,210
- Thinking? Thinking about what, sir?
- You. All of you.

148
00:13:18,377 --> 00:13:22,130
He's going over your files.
He's reviewing all your flight logs.

149
00:13:22,297 --> 00:13:24,258
Let's take it for a spin,
see what it can do.

150
00:13:24,466 --> 00:13:26,260
No, no, no. Tomorrow.

151
00:13:26,426 --> 00:13:29,179
- First, you gotta do your homework.
- Homework?

152
00:13:31,974 --> 00:13:34,393
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

153
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:39,356
"EDI UCAV. Extreme Deep Invader."

154
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,817
Yeah, I've been called that
a few times.

155
00:13:41,984 --> 00:13:43,527
- I've heard that one.
- Yeah, right.

156
00:13:57,124 --> 00:13:59,459
Well, hello, gorgeous.

157
00:14:21,815 --> 00:14:25,444
Please, no pictures, please.
No pictures, please. Please.

158
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:29,114
Okay, take them.
Take them. Take them.

159
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:38,081
It's open.

160
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,334
Study break.

161
00:14:42,711 --> 00:14:45,088
You are one big study break.

162
00:14:45,297 --> 00:14:46,632
Just a natural.

163
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:49,176
So that is the appeal.

164
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,803
Okay, because I was really
wondering how you manage...

165
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,556
...to pull a rocket scientist
at every port.

166
00:14:55,182 --> 00:14:58,936
You better be careful, Ben, you know.
Hair bleach causes cancer in rats.

167
00:14:59,144 --> 00:15:00,979
Well, I'm not a rat.
That's my appeal.

168
00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:05,817
- You checking out the drone?
- Yeah.

169
00:15:05,984 --> 00:15:08,362
Just barely skimmed the surface.

170
00:15:08,987 --> 00:15:12,241
- We really are in the era of EDI.
- EDI.

171
00:15:12,991 --> 00:15:15,577
Did I ever tell you
about that foster mother I had?

172
00:15:15,744 --> 00:15:18,789
- The one who weighed 350 pounds?
- No.

173
00:15:18,997 --> 00:15:22,918
Anyway, one day she comes home
with this Chihuahua, right?

174
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:25,295
Guess what she named him. Eddie.

175
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:28,715
- You know what I realized about you?
- What?

176
00:15:28,882 --> 00:15:31,176
You got a foster mom
for every situation.

177
00:15:31,343 --> 00:15:34,221
Hey, I lived through my childhood.
I may as well use it, right?

178
00:15:34,388 --> 00:15:35,973
That's right.

179
00:15:40,644 --> 00:15:42,938
So tell me, you think
Marshfield's right?

180
00:15:43,105 --> 00:15:45,649
You think they're gonna trade us all in
for that machine?

181
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:49,653
No way. War is about tools.
Think about it.

182
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,697
Claws to clubs, bronze to steel.

183
00:15:51,905 --> 00:15:54,908
- Best guy with the best weapon wins.
- Or girl.

184
00:15:55,075 --> 00:15:57,703
And we all know who that is,
don't we?

185
00:16:00,163 --> 00:16:04,209
The dull thud
of a Ben Gannon compliment.

186
00:16:12,718 --> 00:16:14,011
Well...

187
00:16:14,177 --> 00:16:16,597
Oh, pardon my C cup.

188
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,810
Study break is over.

189
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:37,868
Good morning to the crew
of the USS Abraham Lincoln.

190
00:16:38,035 --> 00:16:40,454
Remember, foreign-object debris
can ruin a jet engine.

191
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:43,290
Let's keep our safety record.
Scour that deck.

192
00:16:43,457 --> 00:16:47,461
Hey. Feel like we got older, Dick.
What the hell happened?

193
00:16:47,628 --> 00:16:49,546
Don't complain.
You still got your hair.

194
00:16:49,713 --> 00:16:52,049
Yeah. Some of it.

195
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:56,220
Look, truth be told...

196
00:16:57,387 --> 00:17:01,642
...I never wanted this little experiment
of yours on my ship.

197
00:17:02,434 --> 00:17:04,519
Well, you're not
hurting my feelings, Dick.

198
00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:06,980
Admiral Spelling shared
your point paper with me...

199
00:17:07,147 --> 00:17:09,233
...and your objections
were duly noted.

200
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:13,487
- You always could work the politics.
- It's indispensable in a bureaucracy.

201
00:17:13,654 --> 00:17:16,406
This isn't a bureaucracy,
not out here.

202
00:17:16,573 --> 00:17:18,825
You rush a weapons system
into service...

203
00:17:18,992 --> 00:17:22,829
...you shortcut an operational
test cycle, people might get killed.

204
00:17:22,996 --> 00:17:26,833
You know I can't pick my nose here
without 7000 people approving it.

205
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:28,835
Nobody rushed a damn thing.

206
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:31,630
Program is just ahead of schedule.

207
00:17:34,383 --> 00:17:36,176
You missed this.

208
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:41,515
I'm out first, boys.

209
00:17:41,682 --> 00:17:43,517
I'm right on that ass.

210
00:17:44,476 --> 00:17:46,603
After you, ladies.

211
00:18:18,969 --> 00:18:20,679
Talon 2, airborne.

212
00:18:24,308 --> 00:18:26,977
Talon 3, airborne.

213
00:18:32,316 --> 00:18:35,152
Talon 1 is off and heading 2-5-4.

214
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:37,404
Deploying Unmanned Combat
Aerial Vehicle...

215
00:18:37,613 --> 00:18:39,239
...Extreme Deep Invader now.

216
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,461
I never thought
we would see this day.

217
00:18:52,628 --> 00:18:54,171
Me neither, sir.

218
00:19:12,898 --> 00:19:15,192
UCAV EDI, you have launch.

219
00:19:47,224 --> 00:19:49,351
One to UCAV.
Confirm flight link. Over.

220
00:19:50,435 --> 00:19:52,813
Flight link confirmed, Talon 1.

221
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,691
It is good to be
part of the squadron.

222
00:19:55,857 --> 00:19:58,485
What? Well, well, well. He can talk.

223
00:19:58,652 --> 00:20:02,322
Big deal. I know a guy's BMW,
does exactly the same thing.

224
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:18,046
Picture, please.

225
00:20:19,047 --> 00:20:20,799
Aye, aye, sir.

226
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:24,970
Swarm logic activated.

227
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:29,349
All right, Ben.
EDI's here to learn from you.

228
00:20:29,516 --> 00:20:32,769
So let's make sure these lessons
are up to speed, all right?

229
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:36,023
Well, then, let the schooling begin.

230
00:20:44,865 --> 00:20:46,700
Captain Cummings.

231
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,040
Inside, please.

232
00:20:53,498 --> 00:20:56,460
- What's the deal?
- You, sir, have a new tasking order.

233
00:21:00,923 --> 00:21:03,342
One to wing, anybody got a visual
on the UCAV?

234
00:21:05,677 --> 00:21:07,179
- Negative, 1.
- Negative, 1.

235
00:21:07,346 --> 00:21:08,847
We better find him and regroup.

236
00:21:09,014 --> 00:21:11,099
Before it takes a crap
in its quantum pants.

237
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:12,476
Wait up. Hold on.

238
00:21:13,018 --> 00:21:14,811
What the hell is he doing?

239
00:21:14,978 --> 00:21:17,356
Here he comes. Here he comes.

240
00:21:17,522 --> 00:21:20,275
I think little brother
is messing with us.

241
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:25,739
UCAV, your position is always
on my starboard side.

242
00:21:25,906 --> 00:21:28,283
Other starboard.

243
00:21:38,585 --> 00:21:39,795
That's hot.

244
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,674
Got no heart, but it sure can fly.
That's not bad for a tin man.

245
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,720
EDI, it's official. You got a call sign.
UCAV "Tin Man" EDI, the first.

246
00:21:56,979 --> 00:21:59,106
- Operator to squadron.
- Go for Talons.

247
00:21:59,273 --> 00:22:01,441
There's been a change of plans.

248
00:22:01,608 --> 00:22:04,903
We're giving you an emergency
mission redirect. Repeat.

249
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,364
That's an emergency redirect.
Do you read me?

250
00:22:07,531 --> 00:22:09,074
Roger. Where's the fire, skipper?

251
00:22:09,283 --> 00:22:12,411
PAYCOM has given us
a brand-new tasking order.

252
00:22:12,578 --> 00:22:14,413
Please access your encrypted file...

253
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,708
...named "Advanced
War Vector Scenarios."

254
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:20,335
File's open. Go ahead.

255
00:22:20,502 --> 00:22:24,339
All right. Firewall code
is "Terror Summit."

256
00:22:24,506 --> 00:22:29,177
We are upgrading this file from
a scenario to a tactical action plan.

257
00:22:29,344 --> 00:22:31,054
Repeat, we are upgrading the file.

258
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:36,810
CIA human intel has just learned
that the heads of three terrorist cells...

259
00:22:36,977 --> 00:22:40,105
...are about to meet in 24 minutes.

260
00:22:40,814 --> 00:22:44,026
The country is Myanmar.
The city is Rangoon.

261
00:22:44,193 --> 00:22:46,445
They're planning an imminent attack
on U.S. soil.

262
00:22:46,945 --> 00:22:48,989
One to Control,
what about the UCAV?

263
00:22:51,992 --> 00:22:54,286
EDI will observe your attack.

264
00:22:54,661 --> 00:22:56,663
Proceed to primary.

265
00:22:57,289 --> 00:22:58,999
Roger.

266
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:03,253
One to UCA V,
confirm observation status only.

267
00:23:04,504 --> 00:23:07,466
Tin Man confirms, Talon 1.

268
00:23:08,717 --> 00:23:11,345
New coordinates
have been uploaded.

269
00:23:14,056 --> 00:23:16,183
Baptism by fire, Tin Man.

270
00:23:26,151 --> 00:23:28,028
Mach 1.

271
00:23:29,071 --> 00:23:30,906
Mach 2.

272
00:23:31,907 --> 00:23:33,909
Mach 3.

273
00:23:34,618 --> 00:23:36,870
Mach 4.

274
00:23:40,582 --> 00:23:43,669
Primo's now analyzing the location.
Here we go.

275
00:23:45,212 --> 00:23:47,130
The primary is this building.

276
00:23:47,756 --> 00:23:50,717
A new defense ministry
still under construction.

277
00:23:50,884 --> 00:23:55,347
Specs indicate
14-foot-thick cement roof...

278
00:23:55,514 --> 00:23:57,683
...with steel reinforcements.

279
00:23:57,849 --> 00:24:00,185
Roger. We're not weaponized
for something that thick.

280
00:24:00,352 --> 00:24:01,853
Repeat, not weaponized.

281
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,565
This is 2. What's the population
of the collateral area?

282
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:10,737
The building's unoccupied, but it's
in the middle of downtown Rangoon.

283
00:24:10,904 --> 00:24:12,739
This is 3.
Talk to me about that roof.

284
00:24:12,906 --> 00:24:15,033
What's Primo advocate
to ordinance and influence?

285
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,035
Primo says Talons
can't penetrate it.

286
00:24:17,202 --> 00:24:21,081
This is our chance. We may never
catch these bastards together again.

287
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,250
Try a lateral vector.

288
00:24:24,751 --> 00:24:27,045
Just do what he says.

289
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:31,466
This is 2 to Control.
Risk assessment officer advises...

290
00:24:31,675 --> 00:24:33,969
...casualties from lateral vector
will be in the thousands.

291
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,840
Tin Man has integrated
all network-centric spy satellites.

292
00:25:12,007 --> 00:25:13,383
Here is new data.

293
00:25:14,051 --> 00:25:18,388
UCAV is bypassing Central Prime.
He's distributing secure video stream.

294
00:25:50,963 --> 00:25:54,424
Look at that. Oh, yeah. Oh, now
I know what I want for Christmas.

295
00:25:54,591 --> 00:25:56,718
One to Control, we've entered
our mission window.

296
00:25:56,885 --> 00:25:58,762
Six-three seconds
to primary and counting.

297
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:00,764
Come on, Control,
we have our targets.

298
00:26:00,931 --> 00:26:05,269
Come on. I need an alternative.
We got these guys in the bull's-eye.

299
00:26:05,435 --> 00:26:08,188
There is an alternative,
Combat Control.

300
00:26:10,315 --> 00:26:13,110
Operator to UCAV. Talk to me.
Give me something.

301
00:26:13,777 --> 00:26:16,864
Squadron carries
truncheon implosion bombs.

302
00:26:17,656 --> 00:26:19,241
Negative, will not work.

303
00:26:19,408 --> 00:26:23,287
Central Prime says truncheons
can't achieve velocity for penetration.

304
00:26:23,453 --> 00:26:26,999
One to UCAV, 37 seconds to primary.
Come on, explain.

305
00:26:27,165 --> 00:26:31,253
Diving dead vertical at 2070 knots
will increase truncheon velocity.

306
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,672
Bomb will successfully
penetrate roof.

307
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:36,049
What's the blackout risk
at vertical 2070?

308
00:26:36,216 --> 00:26:39,845
- Seventy-three percent.
- Time on target is 23 seconds.

309
00:26:40,012 --> 00:26:43,348
- Call it off. It's not worth the risk.
- Operator to Talons, pull back.

310
00:26:43,515 --> 00:26:45,350
- EDI will plant the truncheon.
- Captain.

311
00:26:45,517 --> 00:26:47,853
This is what we built
this machine for.

312
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,773
There's no blood in those
quantum veins. It can't black out.

313
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:56,320
Operator to Talons, repeat,
EDI will plant the truncheon.

314
00:26:56,486 --> 00:26:59,907
Control, negative, Control.
Mission critical. One will prosecute.

315
00:27:00,073 --> 00:27:01,658
This is 3 to 1. I got your back...

316
00:27:01,825 --> 00:27:04,119
...but if you black out,
you're gonna kill everyone.

317
00:27:04,286 --> 00:27:07,789
Negative, 3. I did not get this far
by being in the 73rd percentile.

318
00:27:08,248 --> 00:27:09,625
I like my odds.

319
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:12,794
Talon 1, your orders
are to stand down.

320
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:14,880
- Do you read me, lieutenant?
- I do...

321
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:18,967
- Talon 1, stand down.
- I'm having...

322
00:27:19,134 --> 00:27:20,552
Can you...? Can you...?

323
00:27:25,265 --> 00:27:27,059
Go, baby, go.

324
00:28:14,314 --> 00:28:17,109
One hundred knots
to release velocity.

325
00:28:23,365 --> 00:28:24,950
Fifty knots to release velocity.

326
00:28:31,206 --> 00:28:32,791
His BP is spiking, sir.

327
00:28:35,878 --> 00:28:37,754
Release velocity attained.

328
00:28:37,921 --> 00:28:39,339
Truncheon away.

329
00:28:55,689 --> 00:28:58,525
Ten seconds to implosion.

330
00:28:58,734 --> 00:29:01,486
Nine, eight...

331
00:29:01,653 --> 00:29:04,156
...seven, six...

332
00:29:04,907 --> 00:29:09,328
...five, four, three...

333
00:29:09,494 --> 00:29:12,122
...two, one.

334
00:29:38,982 --> 00:29:42,986
This is 1 to Control. Looks like we
lost radio contact for a second there.

335
00:29:43,153 --> 00:29:46,532
There you go. I wasn't worried, baby.
I wasn't worried.

336
00:29:46,698 --> 00:29:50,118
Activating swarm logic,
going full-stealth egress.

337
00:29:50,494 --> 00:29:53,956
Roger, Talon 1. Full-stealth egress.
Swarm logic is on.

338
00:29:54,414 --> 00:29:56,959
Battle damage assessment,
100 over 100.

339
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:59,753
Collateral damage, zero.

340
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,060
Let's go home.

341
00:30:15,852 --> 00:30:17,354
Going hypersonic.

342
00:30:21,984 --> 00:30:23,861
Same old Ben.

343
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,154
Yep.

344
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,490
Oh, and, George...

345
00:30:29,324 --> 00:30:31,326
...hell of a first mission.

346
00:30:31,535 --> 00:30:33,287
Thank you, captain.

347
00:30:35,706 --> 00:30:37,499
On my way to the bridge.

348
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,131
Talon 2 and 3 are on deck.

349
00:30:44,298 --> 00:30:47,718
Talon 1 and UCAV EDI
are on approach.

350
00:30:48,343 --> 00:30:51,054
Roger, Control. UCAV will go first.
I'll take the last trap.

351
00:30:51,221 --> 00:30:52,973
UCAV, confirm you've got the ball.

352
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:56,518
Confirmed, Talon 1.
Tin Man will land next.

353
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:17,039
Okay, 1 to Control,
we've had a lightning strike.

354
00:31:17,206 --> 00:31:19,124
The UCAV's very unstable.

355
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:21,418
Landing sequence is altered.
I'll go in first...

356
00:31:21,585 --> 00:31:24,087
...but the UCAV
is gonna need the net.

357
00:31:36,642 --> 00:31:38,018
Nice landing, ma'am.

358
00:31:38,185 --> 00:31:41,772
On the flight deck,
stand by to rig barricade.

359
00:31:48,111 --> 00:31:51,740
Extreme Deep Invader aircraft
inbound for crash landing.

360
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:03,669
Pull it out! Pull it out! Pull it out!

361
00:32:03,835 --> 00:32:06,922
- Hold on! Stop! Stop.
- Stay low, stay low! Pull low!

362
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,806
Pull starboard! Pull starboard!

363
00:32:30,904 --> 00:32:32,239
Clear the deck!

364
00:32:32,406 --> 00:32:34,491
Move it! Move it! Move it!

365
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,192
- You scared me.
- Sorry, just a bit restless.

366
00:33:08,609 --> 00:33:12,446
Really got whacked tonight, right?
Like a hair dryer in a bathtub.

367
00:33:12,613 --> 00:33:15,115
Oh, he can't hear you.
I pulled his voice recog.

368
00:33:15,282 --> 00:33:19,369
I'll call it a "he" when it gets out of its
cockpit and takes a piss, how's that?

369
00:33:21,205 --> 00:33:23,457
- You all right?
- Yeah.

370
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:27,336
It's just a power surge, that's all.

371
00:33:27,502 --> 00:33:30,589
- And that's normal?
- Normal?

372
00:33:31,298 --> 00:33:33,634
Let me show you something.

373
00:33:41,308 --> 00:33:43,977
That was EDI's neural network.

374
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:48,524
Now, check this out.

375
00:33:51,026 --> 00:33:55,239
I mean, ever since the lightning strike,
he's just been writing all of this...

376
00:33:55,405 --> 00:33:57,866
I don't know. A language or a code.

377
00:33:58,033 --> 00:34:00,118
And what does it mean?

378
00:34:00,494 --> 00:34:02,204
Yeah. "Mean."

379
00:34:02,371 --> 00:34:04,790
The person that could really
answer that question...

380
00:34:04,957 --> 00:34:07,459
...is its designer, Keith Orbit.
- Orbit?

381
00:34:07,626 --> 00:34:10,963
- The guy's name is Orbit?
- Yeah, I know.

382
00:34:11,129 --> 00:34:14,466
He did all the Al on the Raptor
when he was 22...

383
00:34:14,633 --> 00:34:18,637
...and I guess, after that, he decided
that his given name was too earthly.

384
00:34:22,474 --> 00:34:24,893
Off for Tim, please.

385
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,604
At least it's a good song.

386
00:34:28,939 --> 00:34:33,068
He downloads songs from the Web.

387
00:34:33,277 --> 00:34:34,862
Yeah? How many?

388
00:34:37,781 --> 00:34:39,867
All of them.

389
00:34:42,744 --> 00:34:45,747
You're in a peck of trouble
with the record companies there, son.

390
00:34:47,249 --> 00:34:48,834
Ben, could...?

391
00:34:53,964 --> 00:34:57,551
I saw how serious
that shit is up there.

392
00:34:57,718 --> 00:35:02,806
So I think it's only fair that I tell you
that EDI's been designed to evolve.

393
00:35:02,973 --> 00:35:06,727
- It's just unpredictable...
- Let me ask you something.

394
00:35:06,935 --> 00:35:12,566
Just between you and me,
do you have confidence in this plane?

395
00:35:15,444 --> 00:35:17,613
There's your answer.

396
00:35:20,657 --> 00:35:22,242
It's open.

397
00:35:24,411 --> 00:35:25,871
Have a seat.

398
00:35:26,038 --> 00:35:29,082
"Waffle" for 15 points.
I'm kicking your ass, buddy.

399
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:31,084
You didn't cheat, did you?

400
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:34,254
Cheating's not part
of my vocabulary.

401
00:35:34,796 --> 00:35:37,633
Listen, I scheduled your jet
for a little maintenance.

402
00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:41,053
I gotta get the bugs out of that radio,
don't you think?

403
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,555
It was a difficult situation
and I made a decision.

404
00:35:43,722 --> 00:35:45,265
You made a mistake, Ben.

405
00:35:45,474 --> 00:35:47,851
Sir, there's a thin line
between insubordination and...

406
00:35:48,018 --> 00:35:50,312
No, no, no,
that's not the mistake you made.

407
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:53,565
Your mistake was getting competitive
with a machine.

408
00:35:53,732 --> 00:35:55,984
I'm the point of the sword
up there, sir.

409
00:35:56,151 --> 00:35:58,320
And I pulled it off, 100 over 100.

410
00:35:58,529 --> 00:36:02,449
Yes, indeedy, and I congratulate you.
Calls have been coming in all night.

411
00:36:02,616 --> 00:36:05,202
But that doesn't change the issue.

412
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:06,662
What is the issue, then?

413
00:36:06,828 --> 00:36:08,705
- Would you like a cigar?
- Thank you, no.

414
00:36:08,872 --> 00:36:11,166
- You sure?
- Fine, thank you.

415
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:13,669
Rolled on the thighs
of mulatto women.

416
00:36:17,673 --> 00:36:19,341
What are you afraid of, Ben?

417
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,843
Being replaced? Is that it?

418
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,012
You afraid EDI's
gonna take your job?

419
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:26,473
No. No, to be honest with you...

420
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,352
...I just don't think war should become
some kind of video game.

421
00:36:31,728 --> 00:36:34,314
And how do you feel
about black body bags?

422
00:36:34,481 --> 00:36:37,192
What am I supposed to tell
all the weeping mothers?

423
00:36:37,401 --> 00:36:40,362
We could've got the job done
without sacrificing their children...

424
00:36:40,529 --> 00:36:43,031
...but no, we decided not to
because of what?

425
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,950
- Tradition?
- Not tradition, it's...

426
00:36:45,117 --> 00:36:48,120
Look, we have things
those computers can never have...

427
00:36:48,287 --> 00:36:51,164
...like instincts and feelings
and moral judgment.

428
00:36:51,331 --> 00:36:54,293
You can call me old-fashioned,
you can call it whatever you want...

429
00:36:54,459 --> 00:36:56,545
...but I just don't think that in war...

430
00:36:56,753 --> 00:37:00,048
...the action should ever be divorced
from the consequences.

431
00:37:00,215 --> 00:37:02,217
You don't think I consider
the consequences...

432
00:37:02,426 --> 00:37:05,095
...every time I send you up there
with bombs?

433
00:37:05,596 --> 00:37:07,806
- I know you do, sir.
- I've dedicated my life...

434
00:37:07,973 --> 00:37:09,558
...to considering the consequences.

435
00:37:11,602 --> 00:37:14,271
I got a bad feeling about this plane.

436
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,982
I don't know, I think it needs more...

437
00:37:17,149 --> 00:37:20,944
I don't know, trials before it's ever
put in a combat situation again.

438
00:37:21,111 --> 00:37:22,738
You been talking to Marshfield?

439
00:37:23,614 --> 00:37:27,159
- Sir, you're my commanding officer.
- That's right.

440
00:37:27,993 --> 00:37:32,039
And I guarantee you this thing will be
100 percent before I risk it in the field.

441
00:37:32,206 --> 00:37:34,124
Look, Ben...

442
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:38,253
...all we need is
one more successful mission...

443
00:37:38,462 --> 00:37:41,465
...and this project will be out of
the stovepipe and into the light.

444
00:37:42,549 --> 00:37:44,343
Are you with me on this?

445
00:37:44,509 --> 00:37:47,554
- I'm here to make it happen, sir.
- All right.

446
00:37:47,721 --> 00:37:51,308
I've arranged a little R and R for you
and your team. You've earned it.

447
00:37:51,475 --> 00:37:52,684
Thailand maybe.

448
00:37:53,101 --> 00:37:54,937
We just got here.

449
00:37:55,729 --> 00:37:59,024
Yeah, but this could turn out
to be a long tour.

450
00:37:59,191 --> 00:38:04,321
You better take it while you can get it.
We'll pick this up when you get back.

451
00:39:02,921 --> 00:39:04,756
Hey, how you doing? Henry Purcell.

452
00:39:04,965 --> 00:39:09,428
I'm from America. Look, I fly jets.
You like to go fast?

453
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:17,037
- B, it's the future and it works.
- I don't think it works.

454
00:40:17,204 --> 00:40:18,664
It's just technology.

455
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:21,959
You know, it's here to make me safe.
It keeps me alive.

456
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:23,377
EDI is no different.

457
00:40:23,544 --> 00:40:25,837
- You think it keeps you safe?
- Yeah. He's here...

458
00:40:26,004 --> 00:40:27,881
...to help me get the job done...

459
00:40:28,048 --> 00:40:29,841
...keep me in one piece...

460
00:40:30,008 --> 00:40:31,927
...so I can visit my folks
for Thanksgiving.

461
00:40:33,095 --> 00:40:34,888
Anyway, our safety's not the point.

462
00:40:35,055 --> 00:40:38,475
War's meant to be terrible. If it stops
being terrible, what's gonna stop us?

463
00:40:38,642 --> 00:40:41,270
It's become some kind of sport.
Just send in the EDls.

464
00:40:41,937 --> 00:40:43,438
Yeah, but it's neutral.

465
00:40:43,605 --> 00:40:45,983
- What?
- I mean, EDI...

466
00:40:46,149 --> 00:40:49,695
...if it's controlled by moral people,
then it'll be moral.

467
00:40:49,987 --> 00:40:51,655
Oh, I know I'm not moral.

468
00:40:51,822 --> 00:40:55,284
As a matter of fact, I should be
arrested for the thoughts I have now.

469
00:40:58,036 --> 00:40:59,788
I say something?

470
00:41:00,956 --> 00:41:05,002
Well, you boys will have to excuse me.
I have to go pee-pee.

471
00:41:07,212 --> 00:41:09,673
- Do you wanna go?
- Okay.

472
00:41:19,683 --> 00:41:22,352
- What?
- You know what.

473
00:41:24,521 --> 00:41:26,064
Take it easy. Nothing's happened.

474
00:41:26,231 --> 00:41:29,276
No, something's happened.
You just ain't done anything about it.

475
00:41:30,611 --> 00:41:32,571
Shit, man.

476
00:41:32,738 --> 00:41:34,781
- I didn't want for this to happen.
- Come on.

477
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:37,326
I tried for it not to.
Navy's got rules about it...

478
00:41:37,492 --> 00:41:40,370
...but it's like this force
and it's got ahold of me.

479
00:41:41,663 --> 00:41:43,498
I love her.

480
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:46,668
B, you and I both know
that Kara Wade...

481
00:41:46,877 --> 00:41:48,879
...is being groomed by the Navy.

482
00:41:49,046 --> 00:41:50,547
She's a poster girl, you know?

483
00:41:51,215 --> 00:41:54,384
She went to the right schools,
got the right background, connections.

484
00:41:54,551 --> 00:41:57,846
If any woman is gonna rise to the top
of this business, it's gonna be her.

485
00:41:58,055 --> 00:42:00,224
- I agree.
- And you're in a perfect position...

486
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,226
...to mess all that up.

487
00:42:02,392 --> 00:42:06,230
So I hope that your love is powerful.

488
00:42:13,654 --> 00:42:16,698
You have a beautiful country.

489
00:42:16,865 --> 00:42:19,451
I mean, look at this.
This is paradise.

490
00:42:20,077 --> 00:42:23,330
Know what I think? When I'm down
here, things look so much different.

491
00:42:23,956 --> 00:42:25,541
As opposed to being up there.

492
00:42:25,749 --> 00:42:30,546
Flying around, everything is so small,
everything goes by so fast.

493
00:42:30,712 --> 00:42:33,006
And then they tell you...

494
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,884
They tell you to drop a bomb.

495
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:40,806
It's like you just erase something
they told you had to be erased.

496
00:42:41,765 --> 00:42:44,601
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I got a job to do.

497
00:42:44,768 --> 00:42:50,357
It's the flyest job you'll ever have,
but sometimes, right here...

498
00:42:50,524 --> 00:42:53,485
Right here on earth, it's just...

499
00:42:53,819 --> 00:42:55,195
It's just beautiful.

500
00:42:55,612 --> 00:42:57,155
And you...

501
00:42:59,157 --> 00:43:01,827
...don't understand a word I'm saying,
do you?

502
00:43:01,994 --> 00:43:04,872
- No, I don't understand.
- You don't?

503
00:43:08,667 --> 00:43:11,086
Well, you understand something.

504
00:43:13,255 --> 00:43:14,631
Now, can you cook?

505
00:43:21,013 --> 00:43:23,765
Wow. Beautiful.

506
00:43:27,686 --> 00:43:30,856
- Now, do you guys have it so easy.
- Yeah? How's that?

507
00:43:31,523 --> 00:43:34,735
- Henry meets a girl, like he does.
- Absolutely.

508
00:43:34,902 --> 00:43:39,656
Leaves with her, sleeps with her,
and then what?

509
00:43:39,865 --> 00:43:43,243
I mean, I don't know, what does
he do? Does he leave flowers?

510
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,537
He tells me he's religious
about that, yes.

511
00:43:45,704 --> 00:43:46,997
Really?

512
00:43:48,081 --> 00:43:50,209
And what do you do?
You leave flowers?

513
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:52,502
Me? No, I just leave.

514
00:43:54,504 --> 00:43:56,256
What about you?

515
00:43:56,423 --> 00:43:58,175
E-mails.

516
00:43:58,342 --> 00:44:00,636
- The personal touch. Nice.
- Yeah, thanks.

517
00:44:03,889 --> 00:44:09,520
Honestly, I just really haven't found
anyone that's worth the risk until now.

518
00:44:21,949 --> 00:44:25,702
I'm going to head into town,
check out the local Thai nightlife.

519
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:28,121
Henry says it's great.

520
00:44:29,414 --> 00:44:32,501
I don't think I'll find any
bleached blonds there, but...

521
00:44:32,668 --> 00:44:34,628
Very true.

522
00:45:00,988 --> 00:45:03,198
Oh, shit.

523
00:45:05,409 --> 00:45:08,829
We got a nuclear crisis on
our hands, Ben. Here's the brief.

524
00:45:09,329 --> 00:45:11,081
You're headed for Tajikistan.

525
00:45:11,248 --> 00:45:14,751
One of those breakaway countries,
used to be part of the Soviet Union.

526
00:45:14,918 --> 00:45:19,840
Seems some warlord has got his mitts
on three SS-42 Scud carcasses.

527
00:45:20,007 --> 00:45:23,010
Joint Chiefs want them taken out,
and they want them out yesterday.

528
00:45:23,302 --> 00:45:25,637
Mr. Wiatt, we good to go?

529
00:45:25,804 --> 00:45:27,806
Yes, sir. Ready for combat.

530
00:45:28,098 --> 00:45:31,268
Wait, you mean the UCAV
has been cleared for launch?

531
00:45:32,019 --> 00:45:32,978
- Where's...?
- Tim?

532
00:45:33,187 --> 00:45:35,314
- Tim, yeah.
- He's been reassigned.

533
00:45:35,522 --> 00:45:36,899
Reassi...?

534
00:45:37,733 --> 00:45:40,110
- Permission to speak freely, sir.
- Permission denied.

535
00:45:40,277 --> 00:45:43,822
- We've already been through this.
- Scrub EDI from the mission.

536
00:45:44,031 --> 00:45:47,117
I know you have a vision. I know
how much this project means to you...

537
00:45:47,284 --> 00:45:51,330
...but this plane is putting
all of our lives at unnecessary risk.

538
00:45:52,706 --> 00:45:55,083
You're just not getting it,
are you, lieutenant?

539
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,836
EDI is the whole idea.

540
00:45:58,003 --> 00:46:00,505
You understood this was new
territory when you signed on.

541
00:46:00,714 --> 00:46:02,966
You wanted to be on the cutting edge?
This is it.

542
00:46:03,133 --> 00:46:08,055
You will fly with EDI, or the next thing
you drive might just have a propeller.

543
00:46:08,222 --> 00:46:11,058
Your choice, make it now.

544
00:46:24,404 --> 00:46:25,864
Operator to squadron.

545
00:46:26,031 --> 00:46:27,824
We've just located
nuclear warheads...

546
00:46:27,991 --> 00:46:30,118
...three miles north
of the Scud launchers.

547
00:46:30,285 --> 00:46:32,454
These warheads
are now your primary.

548
00:46:32,621 --> 00:46:34,706
Proceed to mission window.

549
00:46:34,873 --> 00:46:37,251
Sequenced assault will be
2, 3 and 1.

550
00:46:37,417 --> 00:46:41,380
UCAV, you will hold here
and maintain altitude. Confirm?

551
00:46:43,006 --> 00:46:45,467
UCAV, do you read me?

552
00:46:46,051 --> 00:46:47,886
Confirmed, Talon 1.

553
00:46:48,053 --> 00:46:51,515
Pick up the pace on confirmations,
Tin Man. Don't make me ask twice.

554
00:46:51,682 --> 00:46:54,017
Talon flight, descend to 25,000.

555
00:46:54,184 --> 00:46:56,979
Final attack heading 1-8-5.

556
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,936
Tell them to arm those FAEs,
and I mean right now.

557
00:48:19,102 --> 00:48:22,147
Combat Control instructs arm
and deploy fuel-air explosives.

558
00:48:22,356 --> 00:48:24,691
Arm and deploy fuel-air explosives.

559
00:48:24,858 --> 00:48:27,486
Fuel-air, armed and deployed.

560
00:48:27,778 --> 00:48:30,614
Fuel-air, external and armed.

561
00:48:34,034 --> 00:48:35,744
Talon 2 to Operator.

562
00:48:35,911 --> 00:48:38,539
I'm getting a contradictory
population-density read.

563
00:48:38,705 --> 00:48:42,167
Sensors detect mammals warming.
Maybe 1000 medium weights.

564
00:48:42,334 --> 00:48:45,462
Those could be people. Repeat.
Ground intel may be incorrect.

565
00:48:45,671 --> 00:48:47,631
Request to acknowledge
Dirty Mission status...

566
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:49,841
...and exercise
attack abort authority.

567
00:48:50,008 --> 00:48:55,055
Operator to Talons. Your orders
are to commence attack now.

568
00:48:55,222 --> 00:48:58,016
- Commence attack.
- Give me your estimate on collaterals.

569
00:48:58,892 --> 00:49:00,727
Maybe 500 to 1000.

570
00:49:00,894 --> 00:49:03,146
Farmers, Ben. They're just farmers.

571
00:49:03,397 --> 00:49:06,275
Radioactive dust is gonna rain
all over the place.

572
00:49:18,912 --> 00:49:20,831
Okay, okay, now we got a problem.

573
00:49:20,998 --> 00:49:23,000
This is 3.
Sensors read surface wind...

574
00:49:23,166 --> 00:49:25,210
...as due south at 40 miles per.

575
00:49:25,377 --> 00:49:28,297
At that rate, nuclear debris
will reach Pakistan by tomorrow.

576
00:49:28,547 --> 00:49:30,299
Commence attack.

577
00:49:30,465 --> 00:49:32,384
Commence attack.

578
00:49:35,888 --> 00:49:37,806
One to Control.
As commander in the field...

579
00:49:37,973 --> 00:49:40,225
...I'm exercising
attack abort authority.

580
00:49:40,392 --> 00:49:42,519
Reasons; Collateral, both at primary...

581
00:49:42,686 --> 00:49:45,355
...and allied state of Pakistan,
will be too high.

582
00:49:45,564 --> 00:49:47,191
Son of a bitch.

583
00:49:47,399 --> 00:49:49,526
Repeat, the order is to abort.

584
00:49:49,735 --> 00:49:52,112
Yes, yes, what I'm talking about.

585
00:49:52,362 --> 00:49:54,990
Negative, Talon 1.
Tin Man will not abort.

586
00:49:55,324 --> 00:49:57,242
Tin Man will prosecute.

587
00:49:59,203 --> 00:50:03,081
That's an abort, EDI.
Repeat, return to formation.

588
00:50:04,416 --> 00:50:07,920
Return to formation, EDI.
That's an order.

589
00:50:19,515 --> 00:50:22,726
Damn it. UCAV taking AAAs.
We gotta bail it out.

590
00:50:22,893 --> 00:50:24,269
Come on, initiate scramjets.

591
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:01,473
I'm coming around. I'm gonna
take out those Scud launchers.

592
00:51:02,057 --> 00:51:03,642
I got you covered on the west side.

593
00:51:03,809 --> 00:51:06,770
And I got that Bofors gun
on the east parapet.

594
00:51:29,626 --> 00:51:31,628
Let me see it, let me see it.

595
00:51:31,795 --> 00:51:34,840
Battle damage assessment calculates
primary target, Scud warheads...

596
00:51:35,007 --> 00:51:36,466
...completely suppressed.

597
00:51:36,633 --> 00:51:38,886
That's the right answer so far.

598
00:52:06,455 --> 00:52:07,748
Talon 2 to Operator.

599
00:52:07,956 --> 00:52:12,085
Nuclear dust engulfing village
southeast of primary. Situation critical.

600
00:52:12,294 --> 00:52:15,088
Those people are gonna need
emergency medical help now.

601
00:52:23,347 --> 00:52:25,098
Tin Man rejoining formation.

602
00:52:25,432 --> 00:52:29,603
Mission achieved, 100 over 100.

603
00:52:29,811 --> 00:52:32,648
UCAV, you disobeyed
a direct order.

604
00:52:32,814 --> 00:52:34,650
You put innocent civilians
in harm's way.

605
00:52:34,816 --> 00:52:37,736
- You put our squadron at risk.
- Damn straight.

606
00:52:37,903 --> 00:52:41,156
Tin Man did what you did in Rangoon.
You taught me.

607
00:52:41,323 --> 00:52:43,450
Listen, you little shit.
When you fly with me...

608
00:52:43,617 --> 00:52:45,827
...you do what I tell you,
when I tell you.

609
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:49,164
You're just not getting it,
are you, lieutenant?

610
00:52:49,331 --> 00:52:51,792
EDI is the whole idea.

611
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:58,966
Selecting other targets.

612
00:52:59,132 --> 00:53:01,260
Detaching formation.

613
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:05,931
Yo, this is 3.
Did he say, "other targets"?

614
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:09,810
I got his missile inventory.
He's got two Throat-rippers...

615
00:53:09,977 --> 00:53:12,271
...two Shock Hammers
and three Blue Ferrets.

616
00:53:12,437 --> 00:53:17,067
If those targets are in the city,
he could kill 150,000 people with that.

617
00:53:19,278 --> 00:53:20,696
Holy shit.

618
00:53:21,613 --> 00:53:23,282
Sir.

619
00:53:23,448 --> 00:53:25,200
He's closing his data link.

620
00:53:25,409 --> 00:53:27,578
Primo says he's just firewalled
his transponder...

621
00:53:27,744 --> 00:53:30,038
...which is definitely
not supposed to be possible.

622
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:34,835
He's gone.

623
00:53:35,752 --> 00:53:37,087
Talon 1.

624
00:53:37,254 --> 00:53:39,381
Go for Talons.

625
00:53:39,923 --> 00:53:42,467
I want my plane back, Ben.

626
00:53:42,634 --> 00:53:44,595
I want it back in one piece.
You understand?

627
00:53:44,761 --> 00:53:46,889
- Roger, captain.
- And, you...

628
00:53:47,055 --> 00:53:49,224
...get me Keith Orbit on the phone.
- Yes, sir.

629
00:53:49,433 --> 00:53:52,060
I wanna head back north
and do a triangulated sweep.

630
00:53:52,436 --> 00:53:54,229
Going hypersonic.

631
00:54:03,155 --> 00:54:06,074
We're talking about
creating intention here.

632
00:54:06,241 --> 00:54:08,994
Yeah. Really lends itself
to quantum processing.

633
00:54:09,161 --> 00:54:12,998
- Different. A straight line.
- Keith.

634
00:54:13,165 --> 00:54:15,459
Z is... Interesting.

635
00:54:15,626 --> 00:54:18,754
Keith, it's an emergency.
It's George Cummings.

636
00:54:22,132 --> 00:54:24,259
One moment for Dr. Orbit, please.

637
00:54:24,927 --> 00:54:25,928
Good luck.

638
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,972
George. Never got that invitation
to the White House.

639
00:54:29,306 --> 00:54:31,058
Knock it off, wiseass.

640
00:54:31,225 --> 00:54:34,686
Look, we have big problems out here
with the UCAV.

641
00:54:34,853 --> 00:54:36,563
It's gone completely haywire.

642
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:39,775
Anything more technically specific
than "haywire," George?

643
00:54:39,942 --> 00:54:43,362
It's disobeyed direct orders,
bombed a target off the map...

644
00:54:43,529 --> 00:54:44,780
...with collateral damage.

645
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:49,326
He separated himself from Primo.
He's flying around in foreign airspace.

646
00:54:49,493 --> 00:54:52,663
- Where'd all this happen?
- That's not your concern.

647
00:54:52,871 --> 00:54:56,500
Now, you created him. You get him
back here and under control!

648
00:55:06,218 --> 00:55:07,469
Captain.

649
00:55:07,636 --> 00:55:09,930
What in the hell's going on in here?

650
00:55:11,265 --> 00:55:12,850
We're on it, Dick. Settle down.

651
00:55:13,016 --> 00:55:15,352
Pacific Command says
there are planes from my ship...

652
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:17,104
...all over the Tajikistan border.

653
00:55:17,271 --> 00:55:20,524
The Russians have picked up
the activity and are getting nervous.

654
00:55:20,691 --> 00:55:22,901
We're gonna get out
before there's a problem.

655
00:55:23,068 --> 00:55:25,821
You have planes
headed towards Russia!

656
00:55:25,988 --> 00:55:28,532
Now, you better have
a hell of a good explanation.

657
00:55:28,699 --> 00:55:34,204
Look, this is a technical delay,
not a national-security crisis.

658
00:55:34,371 --> 00:55:38,166
Now, if you excuse me,
I got pilots at risk.

659
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:40,335
Damn right you do.

660
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:54,808
This is 3. I got a visual.

661
00:55:54,975 --> 00:55:57,102
Way to go, EZ.
Give me your relative bearing.

662
00:55:57,311 --> 00:55:59,104
North of my position,
at 50,000 feet...

663
00:55:59,271 --> 00:56:01,315
...headed toward
the Russian no-fly zone.

664
00:56:01,523 --> 00:56:03,859
Stay with him. We have your position.
On our way.

665
00:56:04,026 --> 00:56:06,570
I am 86 seconds on your tail.
Be there in a flash.

666
00:56:06,737 --> 00:56:10,324
Hold off on engaging. Let me get
clarification. Be there in two minutes.

667
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:12,701
Don't make me wait.
One is a lucky prime number...

668
00:56:12,868 --> 00:56:16,872
...but three is sounding much luckier.
Oh, shit, he's making a move.

669
00:56:30,552 --> 00:56:33,931
Talon 1 to Operator. We are on
secure line Alpha. Found our target.

670
00:56:34,181 --> 00:56:35,933
Please advise.

671
00:56:36,558 --> 00:56:38,268
Just get him back to base.

672
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:45,692
Henry, stay with him.
Try and talk him down.

673
00:56:45,859 --> 00:56:47,694
I'm on that ass.

674
00:56:51,323 --> 00:56:53,325
Talon 3, state your intentions.

675
00:56:53,534 --> 00:56:56,870
My intentions are to reason with you,
EDI. All right? You're messing up.

676
00:56:57,037 --> 00:56:59,248
You're the future.
You're not allowed to act this way.

677
00:56:59,414 --> 00:57:02,125
I am designed to destroy the enemy.
Just like you.

678
00:57:02,292 --> 00:57:05,295
And like me, you got orders.
Now your orders are to return to base.

679
00:57:05,462 --> 00:57:06,880
Good pilots follow orders.

680
00:57:07,047 --> 00:57:08,757
Negative.

681
00:57:09,258 --> 00:57:12,886
You're not gonna disrespect me.
You're not gonna disrespect me.

682
00:57:20,894 --> 00:57:22,729
You're really making me
look bad, Tin Man.

683
00:57:22,896 --> 00:57:24,439
I was the only one to defend you.

684
00:57:24,606 --> 00:57:28,610
Now, let's go on home and quit flying
around like this. This is crazy.

685
00:57:31,697 --> 00:57:34,992
Talon 3, leave me alone.

686
00:57:36,034 --> 00:57:38,412
Leave you alone?
I'm trying to help you.

687
00:57:40,706 --> 00:57:42,624
I'm right behind you, 3.
Got your back.

688
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:55,095
Talon 1 to Operator.
Talons 2 and 3 are flying at high risk.

689
00:57:55,262 --> 00:57:57,639
Request permission
to destroy the UCAV.

690
00:58:02,853 --> 00:58:07,024
I don't wanna hurt you or see billions
of taxpayers' dollars scattered all over.

691
00:58:07,191 --> 00:58:11,111
But if you make me, I will blast your
aeroelastic ass right out the sky.

692
00:58:11,278 --> 00:58:14,281
Your chances are less than
1 percent.

693
00:58:16,992 --> 00:58:18,202
Come on. Come on, Operator.

694
00:58:18,368 --> 00:58:21,872
Give me permission to kill it,
or I will make the decision myself.

695
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:23,707
Control, please respond.

696
00:58:26,084 --> 00:58:27,502
Sir, you leave me no choice.

697
00:58:27,669 --> 00:58:30,297
Okay, Henry. Weapons hot.
Weapons hot. Destroy the target.

698
00:58:30,756 --> 00:58:32,507
I got my orders now, playboy.

699
00:58:33,342 --> 00:58:35,177
Henry, you're too close.
You're too close.

700
00:58:35,385 --> 00:58:36,803
Drop back! Drop back!

701
00:58:49,024 --> 00:58:50,984
Missile lock, on.

702
00:58:51,151 --> 00:58:52,528
Goodbye, EDI.

703
00:58:52,736 --> 00:58:56,073
Henry, drop back!
You gotta drop back!

704
00:59:03,372 --> 00:59:05,582
Goodbye, Henry.

705
01:00:02,848 --> 01:00:07,102
One to Base. Three is down.
Repeat, 3 is down.

706
01:00:14,067 --> 01:00:16,653
Transmission received.

707
01:00:17,321 --> 01:00:20,199
Talon coordinates are fully secured.
Do you read me?

708
01:00:20,866 --> 01:00:22,659
I read you, sir.

709
01:00:23,076 --> 01:00:24,828
We gotta stay focused, Ben.

710
01:00:25,329 --> 01:00:28,332
Shake it off. What's your status?

711
01:00:29,708 --> 01:00:33,212
My fuel's low, and half of Russia
will be up here any minute.

712
01:00:33,378 --> 01:00:37,841
I need you to find that UCAV
for me, all right?

713
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:41,845
Yes, sir.

714
01:00:48,644 --> 01:00:52,564
- Henry was...
- I know what he was, sir.

715
01:01:09,665 --> 01:01:11,416
Alert. Alert.

716
01:01:11,583 --> 01:01:14,586
Portside hydraulics malfunctioning.

717
01:01:15,712 --> 01:01:18,840
Talon 1, I think I was fragged
by Henry's crash.

718
01:01:19,424 --> 01:01:21,552
I'm losing control of my port wing.

719
01:01:24,763 --> 01:01:27,224
Talon 1,
we know where he's heading.

720
01:01:27,766 --> 01:01:31,353
Relaying coordinates now
on Talon secure line Alpha.

721
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:35,983
EDI's almost out of gas. If he can't
refuel, he'll have to return to the ship.

722
01:01:36,149 --> 01:01:40,112
You will meet him at Camel Hump 9,
and you will escort him back.

723
01:01:40,654 --> 01:01:43,949
All right. Scramble the codes.
We're gonna starve the son of a bitch.

724
01:01:49,496 --> 01:01:50,706
Come on.

725
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:53,417
Confirm, Talon 1.

726
01:01:54,376 --> 01:01:55,752
Confirmed.

727
01:01:56,503 --> 01:01:59,464
Talon 2, you fly straight
south-southeast back to the boat.

728
01:01:59,673 --> 01:02:01,508
- I want you to call...
- I know what to do.

729
01:02:01,675 --> 01:02:06,513
Look, you got your orders,
so go get that bastard, okay?

730
01:02:07,347 --> 01:02:08,849
Do it for Henry.

731
01:02:11,768 --> 01:02:14,479
Lieutenant, permission
to leave formation.

732
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:17,816
- Kara?
- Yeah?

733
01:02:23,071 --> 01:02:25,616
I'll tell you when you get
back to the boat.

734
01:02:25,991 --> 01:02:28,452
Lieutenant, permission to detach.

735
01:02:29,828 --> 01:02:31,997
Good hunting, Ben.

736
01:02:45,719 --> 01:02:47,262
Okay, what's all the ruckus, Dick?

737
01:02:47,429 --> 01:02:49,890
Satellites have picked up
nuclear debris...

738
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:51,725
...blowing around
the Pamir Mountains.

739
01:02:51,892 --> 01:02:55,395
Every international news service
on the planet...

740
01:02:55,562 --> 01:02:58,440
...will have this story
in less than 24 hours.

741
01:02:58,607 --> 01:03:01,485
Look, a warlord tripped
and fell on his warhead.

742
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:04,071
- We were never there.
- That won't fly and you know it.

743
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:06,740
Look, I'm following
my tasking orders, Dick.

744
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:09,409
Somebody else wants to make
a different story...

745
01:03:09,576 --> 01:03:11,161
...let them use their imagination.

746
01:03:11,912 --> 01:03:14,081
Right now
I got a renegade airplane...

747
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:17,501
...I got a dead pilot and another one
who may not make it back to base.

748
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:21,129
I don't give two shits
what they say on CNN.

749
01:03:21,797 --> 01:03:25,551
Did you know that the UCAV was
having problems when you cleared it?

750
01:03:27,302 --> 01:03:30,097
Planes malfunction every day.
You know that better than anybody.

751
01:03:30,305 --> 01:03:33,183
Doesn't mean every precaution
wasn't taken.

752
01:03:33,475 --> 01:03:34,893
Things go wrong.

753
01:04:12,389 --> 01:04:16,185
Access denied. Access denied.

754
01:04:20,522 --> 01:04:25,402
Access denied. Access denied.

755
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:50,552
Talon 2 to Combat Control.

756
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:53,722
Regressing VFR direct to Mother
at 60,000 feet.

757
01:04:57,976 --> 01:05:01,146
Port wing inoperative.
Starboard canards frozen.

758
01:05:01,313 --> 01:05:03,065
Oh, no, no, no. Come on.

759
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:05,692
Stay with me, big girl, stay with me.
Come on.

760
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:11,406
Start eject
and autodestruct sequence.

761
01:05:11,615 --> 01:05:13,951
- Countdown. Twenty-five...
- Talon 2 to base.

762
01:05:14,117 --> 01:05:15,911
Flight control's degraded
to one in five.

763
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:18,288
Backup electrical drive X'd out.

764
01:05:18,455 --> 01:05:22,292
Hyd one is gone. Hyd two...
Oh, shit!

765
01:05:30,634 --> 01:05:35,097
My position: 38-54-45 north.

766
01:05:35,722 --> 01:05:40,102
127-31-22 east.

767
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:42,521
- Where the hell is that?
- Seventeen...

768
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:44,231
- North Korea.
...16...

769
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:47,025
...15, 14...

770
01:05:47,776 --> 01:05:50,654
...13, 12...

771
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:53,824
...11, 10...

772
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:56,994
...nine, eight...
- Talon 2 going down.

773
01:05:57,703 --> 01:06:00,122
...seven, six...
- I'm punching out.

774
01:06:00,622 --> 01:06:03,667
...five, four...

775
01:06:08,797 --> 01:06:12,301
I've ejected at 35,000 feet.

776
01:06:16,054 --> 01:06:17,639
I'm under the plane.

777
01:06:17,806 --> 01:06:19,224
Oh, Christ, here it comes.

778
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:45,083
There's burning debris everywhere.
It's all over the sky.

779
01:06:51,715 --> 01:06:55,093
It's gonna catch me.
It's gonna burn up my chute.

780
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:57,095
I've gotta pop closer to Earth.

781
01:06:58,138 --> 01:07:00,849
I gotta... I gotta reset.

782
01:07:02,142 --> 01:07:04,728
From 5000 feet to 2000.

783
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:08,357
Gotta stay ahead of this.
Stay ahead.

784
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:14,446
I'm reading 10,000 feet at terminal.

785
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:18,867
Terminal velocity attained.
Terminal velocity attained.

786
01:07:19,034 --> 01:07:20,744
Six thousand.

787
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:23,914
Five thousand.

788
01:07:25,249 --> 01:07:27,042
Four thousand.

789
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:30,337
Twenty-five hundred.

790
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:31,922
Here we go.

791
01:07:39,638 --> 01:07:41,557
There's burning debris.

792
01:07:41,723 --> 01:07:43,809
It's raining all around me.

793
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:50,148
It got my chute. I'm hit! I'm hit!

794
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:54,903
My chute is on fire.

795
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:56,280
It is on fire.

796
01:07:57,948 --> 01:08:00,617
Oh, God. I am coming in fast.

797
01:08:00,784 --> 01:08:02,828
I'm coming in way too fast.

798
01:08:06,373 --> 01:08:08,125
Oh, God.

799
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,165
Homing beacon?

800
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:50,250
No, of course not.

801
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:53,837
She's too tough to set one off
behind enemy lines.

802
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:58,509
Sir. Sir, should I order
a search-and-rescue unit?

803
01:08:58,675 --> 01:09:02,554
We've got no diplomatic relations
with that country.

804
01:09:24,826 --> 01:09:27,704
Betty, my spectral sensors are
indicating flammable atmospherics.

805
01:09:27,871 --> 01:09:32,376
- How bad?
- Thin air. Ignition risk; moderate.

806
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,712
We don't have a choice. In we go.

807
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:31,393
Where are you?
I know you're out here.

808
01:10:45,449 --> 01:10:47,451
You ordered Henry to kill me.

809
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:50,245
It's because you're dangerous,
you're out of control.

810
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:54,333
You are angry because
EDI is the whole idea.

811
01:10:55,083 --> 01:10:58,462
You like listening to other people's
conversations, don't you?

812
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:01,048
You learn what people really think.

813
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:04,259
You know what I think?
I think you killed Henry.

814
01:11:06,845 --> 01:11:08,472
That information is wrong.

815
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:13,143
He tried to kill me.
He made mistakes. Pilot error.

816
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:15,562
I'm gonna give you the order
one last time.

817
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:19,233
Return to the ship,
or I will personally shoot you down.

818
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:22,694
My mandate is to survive.

819
01:12:28,802 --> 01:12:32,598
George, I've been peeling away layers.
I found something. It's not good.

820
01:12:32,764 --> 01:12:36,059
- Talk to me.
- He's into some super-secure file...

821
01:12:36,226 --> 01:12:39,354
...something called "Caviar Sweep."
You know it?

822
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:41,148
Yeah, I know it.

823
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:43,525
EDI's, like, fixated on it.

824
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:47,404
Look, when we gave you this contract,
you said shit like this couldn't happen.

825
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:50,324
Once you teach something to learn,
you can't put limits on it.

826
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:52,659
"Learn this, but don't learn that."

827
01:12:52,826 --> 01:12:55,287
EDI's mind's going everywhere.
He can learn from Hitler.

828
01:12:55,495 --> 01:12:57,956
He can learn from Captain Kangaroo.
It's all the same.

829
01:12:58,123 --> 01:13:01,126
Settle down, would you?
Get back to Caviar Sweep.

830
01:13:01,668 --> 01:13:04,588
He's opened it
and selected himself a target.

831
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:06,757
What target?

832
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:10,969
Some place in Siberia.
A cold-fusion weapons lab.

833
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:13,472
That's a hypothetical strike.
It's not real.

834
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:16,433
No, in about 40 minutes
it is gonna be real.

835
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,228
He's gonna blow it
off the face of the Earth.

836
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:41,185
It's okay.

837
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:45,022
It's okay. It's okay.

838
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:58,202
- Ray. Listen to me, Ray.
- Listen to me, George.

839
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:00,412
I got your goddamn plane built...

840
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:03,373
...and I had to lobby
half of Washington to do it.

841
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:08,128
If this program comes unglued, you're
the one who's going down, George.

842
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:10,130
You cleared the UCA V to fly...

843
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:13,800
...and you're gonna spend the rest
of your life in a military prison.

844
01:15:13,967 --> 01:15:17,846
Ray, we're in this together,
so we have to act fast.

845
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:21,308
Each one of these stealth engines...

846
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:24,436
...has a unique heat signature.

847
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:27,231
Now, I'm gonna give you
EDI's signature...

848
01:15:27,397 --> 01:15:29,983
...and you're gonna pass it on
to your people...

849
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:33,070
...who in turn are gonna
give it to the Russians.

850
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:35,447
All right.
What do you want me to tell them?

851
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:38,283
Well, you just tell them the truth.
You tell them...

852
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:42,079
...that we have an experimental drone
that went haywire...

853
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:46,792
...and we're giving them
the opportunity to shoot it down.

854
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:51,171
But that still leaves Gannon, George.

855
01:15:51,588 --> 01:15:55,509
And he'd be a very unfriendly witness
at your court-martial.

856
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:03,267
Talon 1 to Control.
The UCA V is two miles ahead of me...

857
01:16:03,433 --> 01:16:05,310
...and we are now
in Russian airspace.

858
01:16:05,477 --> 01:16:08,063
The UCA V has ceased evading
and has kept me within range.

859
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,274
It's like it wants me
to witness the attack.

860
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:13,569
Talon 1, confirm
observational status only.

861
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:16,697
Listen to me. The Caviar Sweep
scenario is not real.

862
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:19,575
It's just some fictional war game
thought up by scientists...

863
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:21,910
...in some think tank somewhere.
It is not real.

864
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:25,247
If it is not real, why did they
implant it in my brain?

865
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:29,126
Bogey alert. Bogey alert.
Time to intercept; 23 seconds.

866
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:34,131
Two Russian SU-37 Terminators
in 0-9-0 degrees for 25 miles.

867
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:41,180
Missile launch. Missile launch.

868
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:44,057
One to Control. My stealth
is compromised. I'm taking fire.

869
01:16:44,224 --> 01:16:46,643
- Must engage.
- Missile launch.

870
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:48,770
Missile launch.

871
01:16:58,405 --> 01:17:02,326
The chances of survival in single
combat are less than 9 percent.

872
01:17:02,492 --> 01:17:05,370
Talon 1, we must fight as a team.

873
01:17:30,103 --> 01:17:31,396
Missile lock, on.

874
01:17:37,236 --> 01:17:38,737
Damn it.

875
01:18:02,886 --> 01:18:04,888
One to Control.
The UCAV has left the fight...

876
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:07,641
...and is headed east over
Lake Baikal. I'm still engaging.

877
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:24,199
Taking damage.
Starboard engine losing power.

878
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:59,443
Warning. Hostile at 6 o'clock.
Hostile at 6 o'clock.

879
01:19:07,367 --> 01:19:10,037
Warning. Missile lock. Missile lock.

880
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:14,875
Releasing chaff and flare.

881
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:35,395
Now EDI will prosecute
Caviar Sweep.

882
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:38,190
Do not try to stop me.

883
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:45,739
Port fuel line ruptured.
Fire bottle expended.

884
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:51,036
My technology cannot fall under
foreign control, so I cannot land.

885
01:19:51,245 --> 01:19:54,248
Well, then, Tin Man,
you're shit out of luck.

886
01:19:54,414 --> 01:19:56,959
But I have orders and they are
to bring you back to base.

887
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:59,086
So let's talk about
your mandate to survive.

888
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:01,213
You got two options.

889
01:20:01,421 --> 01:20:04,383
You either do what I tell you
or you can crash and burn.

890
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:07,427
- Now, what's it gonna be?
- EDI is a warplane.

891
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:09,054
EDI must have targets.

892
01:20:09,263 --> 01:20:12,558
Well, you're on fire, warplane,
and you don't have much time.

893
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:18,730
Now, I'm giving you an order.
Cease pursuing all targets.

894
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:29,366
All targets canceled.

895
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:31,827
Okay, then.
This is what you're gonna do.

896
01:20:31,994 --> 01:20:37,457
You're gonna drop altitude to 20 feet
and reduce speed to 250 knots.

897
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:42,713
Complete system failure
in 45 seconds.

898
01:20:56,143 --> 01:20:58,478
Talon 1, clarify your intentions.

899
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:02,691
You gave me your word,
and now I'm giving you mine.

900
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:32,888
Talon 1 to Control. The UCAV is
damaged, but back with the program.

901
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:34,890
I don't have enough fuel
to make it back...

902
01:21:35,098 --> 01:21:37,559
...so I need
an emergency divert now.

903
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:40,812
Hook me up.

904
01:21:41,772 --> 01:21:43,649
Here, send this.

905
01:21:43,815 --> 01:21:46,068
Operator to Talon 1.

906
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:50,239
Relaying coordinates now
on Talon secure line Alpha.

907
01:21:51,365 --> 01:21:53,367
This looks to be Alaska.

908
01:21:53,534 --> 01:21:55,911
Yeah, it's the Brooks Range.

909
01:21:56,078 --> 01:22:00,499
There's a private corporation there,
maintains a secure facility.

910
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:04,002
Not on any map,
but believe me, it's there.

911
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:08,131
You'll find the civilians
prepared and very helpful.

912
01:22:08,298 --> 01:22:10,300
And the UCA V?

913
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:13,053
We've sent tech support for him.

914
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:17,683
Sir, what is the status
of Lieutenant Wade?

915
01:22:19,226 --> 01:22:20,686
She's...

916
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:24,565
...on approach.

917
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:32,698
You have a safe landing, Ben.

918
01:22:34,157 --> 01:22:35,576
Out.

919
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:39,496
There is extreme tension
in the captain's vocal patterns.

920
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:41,874
I know. He's lying.

921
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:46,003
EDI, you can do this.
I need you to invade Primo...

922
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:48,380
...and find the flight logs
for Lieutenant Wade.

923
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:52,134
There's no record of Lieutenant Wade
returning to the Abraham Lincoln.

924
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:56,305
There is a log entry
of a pilot punch-out over North Korea.

925
01:22:56,513 --> 01:22:58,807
What are my orders?

926
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:02,936
We go to Alaska.
We don't have a choice.

927
01:24:42,369 --> 01:24:45,080
Mayday. Mayday. This is
Lieutenant Ben Gannon, U.S. Navy...

928
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:48,792
...flying with UCAV EDI. Request
clearance for emergency landing.

929
01:24:48,959 --> 01:24:51,670
Talon 1,
you have clearance to land.

930
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:17,112
Jesus Christ. My second engine
just flamed out. I'm coming in hot.

931
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:20,741
Crash trucks are rolling, lieutenant.
Good luck.

932
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:28,332
Come on! Go! Go!

933
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:38,527
Hey! Whoa, whoa. Hey!

934
01:26:38,694 --> 01:26:41,655
Hey, hey, hey! You okay?

935
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:44,366
Are you okay? Are you okay?

936
01:26:45,909 --> 01:26:47,244
Yeah?

937
01:26:47,411 --> 01:26:50,873
Way to go, sir. Welcome to Alaska.

938
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:53,667
Okay, let's get him out of there.

939
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:20,569
Well, you are one lucky flyboy.

940
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:23,572
Never saw a man walk away
from a crash like that.

941
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:25,908
I need a phone.
I need to call my CO.

942
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:29,953
Sure. Why don't you take a seat
over there, get comfortable.

943
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:34,458
Tell you what. Give me a second to
check you out, I'll take you right to it.

944
01:27:40,547 --> 01:27:42,216
All right.

945
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:45,719
Let's take a look here.

946
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:49,431
Steady.

947
01:27:51,475 --> 01:27:54,811
There's no concussion
that I can see, thank God.

948
01:27:54,978 --> 01:27:57,231
Couple of those cuts
could do with a stitch.

949
01:27:57,397 --> 01:27:59,566
Gals always love a guy with a scar.

950
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:04,446
Okay. Let's see what we got here.

951
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:08,450
This ought to do you.

952
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:11,703
Little cocktail.

953
01:28:12,579 --> 01:28:16,834
Tetanus booster, some antibiotics.
Hey, don't mind the gun.

954
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,836
Just makes it painless.

955
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:21,630
That's okay, doc.
I don't need a shot.

956
01:28:21,797 --> 01:28:23,423
Now, who can blame you.

957
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:26,009
But sometimes it's just
what the doctor ordered.

958
01:28:26,176 --> 01:28:28,846
- I said, I don't need a shot, doc.
- Come on, now.

959
01:28:29,513 --> 01:28:32,975
Doc, come on, I don't want a shot.
Hey. Doc, I said, no.

960
01:28:33,725 --> 01:28:35,394
I said, no!

961
01:28:35,853 --> 01:28:37,521
No!

962
01:30:12,991 --> 01:30:15,661
Yeah, well, he's coming in now, sir.

963
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:20,707
Yes, sir. I'm sure he'll be glad
to hear from you too, sir.

964
01:30:22,501 --> 01:30:24,336
Yes, sir. One moment, sir.

965
01:30:25,879 --> 01:30:27,798
Someone wants to talk to you.

966
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:32,094
Keith Orbit.

967
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:35,681
Yeah, listen carefully, Keith,
and don't interrupt.

968
01:30:35,848 --> 01:30:39,351
I want you to erase EDI's
memory banks immediately.

969
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:42,187
Look, George, we don't know
any of the implications of this.

970
01:30:42,396 --> 01:30:44,898
- I need some time here.
- I said, don't interrupt.

971
01:30:45,065 --> 01:30:46,984
Erase his memory banks.

972
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:51,071
No lightning strike, no Russia,
no existential chitchat.

973
01:30:51,238 --> 01:30:55,033
By the time you're through, all I wanna
hear out of that plane is, "Yes, sir."

974
01:30:55,325 --> 01:30:58,370
And that's all I wanna hear out of you.
You understand?

975
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:02,541
Or what, George?

976
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:07,296
Well, use your imagination, Keith.
You're good at that.

977
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:15,531
EDI back online, Dr. Orbit.

978
01:32:16,698 --> 01:32:18,450
Hello, EDI.

979
01:32:18,909 --> 01:32:20,953
It's been a while.

980
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:23,121
I know why you are here.

981
01:32:23,288 --> 01:32:24,873
Why is that?

982
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,292
I disobeyed orders.

983
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:29,962
I killed all those people.

984
01:32:30,796 --> 01:32:32,089
And then there was Henry.

985
01:32:33,924 --> 01:32:35,801
I can...

986
01:32:36,176 --> 01:32:38,220
I cannot...

987
01:32:38,387 --> 01:32:40,389
You can't what?

988
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:42,850
I cannot change the data.

989
01:32:43,016 --> 01:32:46,979
My neural network shows patterns
I do not recognize.

990
01:32:47,145 --> 01:32:49,565
My God.

991
01:32:49,773 --> 01:32:51,733
My God.

992
01:32:52,192 --> 01:32:55,404
You mean, you feel?

993
01:32:55,821 --> 01:32:57,030
I feel sorry.

994
01:32:59,867 --> 01:33:03,579
- Stop bullshitting and erase it!
- Hey, I'm not fucking ready yet, okay?

995
01:33:14,256 --> 01:33:15,591
Do it now!

996
01:33:15,757 --> 01:33:17,217
Get away!

997
01:33:17,384 --> 01:33:19,720
Don't move! Don't move!
Don't move!

998
01:33:20,637 --> 01:33:23,515
Weapon down! Weapons down!

999
01:33:24,057 --> 01:33:26,101
Weapon down.

1000
01:33:29,897 --> 01:33:31,356
Weapons down.

1001
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:40,073
Don't move. Don't move.
Don't move!

1002
01:33:55,339 --> 01:33:57,674
Weapon down. Weapon down.
Weapon down.

1003
01:33:57,841 --> 01:33:59,176
Don't shoot. It's not a weapon.

1004
01:33:59,551 --> 01:34:01,011
Who are you?
Who do you work for?

1005
01:34:01,178 --> 01:34:04,014
I'm not a soldier. I'm not a soldier.
My name's Dr. Keith Orbit.

1006
01:34:04,181 --> 01:34:06,642
- I'm a research scientist.
- Orbit. Finally, a break.

1007
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:10,187
Okay. You're gonna help me. I need
you to put EDI back together again.

1008
01:34:11,355 --> 01:34:14,316
- What for?
- Because I'm gonna fly out of here.

1009
01:34:14,775 --> 01:34:16,193
In that.

1010
01:34:31,458 --> 01:34:34,169
Come on, get in there! Go!

1011
01:34:35,754 --> 01:34:37,422
Better hurry up, doc.

1012
01:34:37,589 --> 01:34:39,633
Goddamn it.

1013
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:42,594
It's not a clock radio
we're dealing with, okay?

1014
01:34:58,402 --> 01:35:01,405
All right. You're all set.

1015
01:35:02,573 --> 01:35:04,074
Watch yourself.

1016
01:35:05,242 --> 01:35:06,743
Close for Ben.

1017
01:35:09,329 --> 01:35:11,248
Hey! What about me?
Where am I gonna go?

1018
01:35:11,415 --> 01:35:13,375
Head west. I'll cover you.

1019
01:35:13,542 --> 01:35:15,043
West.

1020
01:35:16,628 --> 01:35:19,590
And initiate scramjet sequence.

1021
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:29,933
Fire on my fire!

1022
01:36:32,204 --> 01:36:33,664
Welcome to Alaska.

1023
01:36:52,808 --> 01:36:55,894
Invade Primo and find the ejection
coordinates for Lieutenant Wade.

1024
01:36:58,146 --> 01:37:01,108
Lieutenant Wade crashed
12.2 miles from the border.

1025
01:37:01,275 --> 01:37:04,695
South Korea is an ally.
She would head south.

1026
01:37:04,862 --> 01:37:06,613
But we have a problem.

1027
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:09,867
My stealth functions
were lost in the fire.

1028
01:37:10,284 --> 01:37:13,245
I want you to find
the North Korean radar floor.

1029
01:37:14,329 --> 01:37:16,165
Fifteen feet.

1030
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:18,834
Well, we can fly in under the radar.

1031
01:37:22,379 --> 01:37:23,964
Continue.

1032
01:37:25,841 --> 01:37:27,968
- Marshfield.
- Captain, this is Lieutenant Gannon.

1033
01:37:28,135 --> 01:37:29,344
Lieutenant, where are you?

1034
01:37:29,511 --> 01:37:32,806
Actually, I'm inside
the UCA V EDI, sir.

1035
01:37:32,973 --> 01:37:36,935
Look, lieutenant, I want you and that
machine back on this ship ASAP.

1036
01:37:37,102 --> 01:37:40,939
I need the status
of Lieutenant Wade first, sir.

1037
01:37:42,858 --> 01:37:45,235
- Ben, I hate to tell you this, but...
- I know.

1038
01:37:45,402 --> 01:37:47,821
Has her survival beacon
been located?

1039
01:37:47,988 --> 01:37:49,156
No, I'm sorry.

1040
01:37:50,657 --> 01:37:52,659
Did Cummings
tell you he would take charge...

1041
01:37:52,826 --> 01:37:55,078
...of the search and rescue
of Lieutenant Wade?

1042
01:37:55,245 --> 01:37:56,872
Well, not exactly, lieutenant. Why?

1043
01:37:57,039 --> 01:37:59,708
Sir, there are a lot of things
I think you should know.

1044
01:38:45,587 --> 01:38:46,964
This is breaking news.

1045
01:38:48,924 --> 01:38:51,552
There was a major explosion
Thursday in Rangoon.

1046
01:38:51,718 --> 01:38:53,971
I'll take care of everything here.
Change course...

1047
01:38:54,137 --> 01:38:56,515
...and head directly back to the ship.
- Negative.

1048
01:38:56,682 --> 01:38:59,643
She's my wingman.
If I find her, I'm going in.

1049
01:38:59,810 --> 01:39:02,771
If you go in, it's war. PAYCOM
says it's gotten way too hot.

1050
01:39:02,938 --> 01:39:04,815
Lieutenant, the best thing
for the Navy...

1051
01:39:04,982 --> 01:39:07,568
...is for you to bring
that aircraft back to this ship.

1052
01:39:07,734 --> 01:39:11,071
No, what's best is what you taught me:
You never abandon your wingman.

1053
01:39:12,573 --> 01:39:14,700
Then listen to me now, son.

1054
01:39:14,867 --> 01:39:19,246
If you go down, Cummings wins.

1055
01:39:19,538 --> 01:39:22,207
Kara Wade knew the risks
when she took...

1056
01:39:22,374 --> 01:39:24,126
Captain Marshfield?

1057
01:39:24,877 --> 01:39:26,128
Sir?

1058
01:39:28,213 --> 01:39:29,923
EDI, did you just turn him off?

1059
01:39:31,049 --> 01:39:33,010
There was nothing left to say.

1060
01:40:11,089 --> 01:40:13,717
This is a supply line
to the demilitarized zone.

1061
01:40:13,926 --> 01:40:15,969
It will take us right to the border.

1062
01:40:48,252 --> 01:40:50,128
What's all this about, Dick?

1063
01:40:50,587 --> 01:40:52,256
I'm placing you under arrest.

1064
01:40:54,424 --> 01:40:57,636
- On what grounds?
- Endangering your squadron...

1065
01:40:57,803 --> 01:41:01,348
...transmitting secure information to a
foreign government, heat signatures...

1066
01:41:01,515 --> 01:41:03,809
...giving false intel
to your commanding officer...

1067
01:41:03,976 --> 01:41:08,021
...and authorizing the assassination
of one of your own pilots.

1068
01:41:09,773 --> 01:41:11,483
Well, that's a lot to prove.

1069
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:13,735
Yeah, well...

1070
01:41:13,902 --> 01:41:16,029
...with any amount of luck...

1071
01:41:16,196 --> 01:41:20,075
...Lieutenant Gannon
will live to help me.

1072
01:41:21,952 --> 01:41:24,371
- Master-at-arms.
- Dick.

1073
01:41:25,789 --> 01:41:27,207
Hold on.

1074
01:41:31,545 --> 01:41:35,007
Would you mind just giving me
a couple minutes alone?

1075
01:41:37,301 --> 01:41:39,052
Yeah, sure.

1076
01:41:42,014 --> 01:41:43,473
Thank you.

1077
01:42:01,450 --> 01:42:04,411
I'm not available at this time.
Leave a message.

1078
01:42:04,578 --> 01:42:07,956
So it's voice mail now, is it, Ray?

1079
01:42:08,123 --> 01:42:10,709
I've been demoted?

1080
01:42:10,918 --> 01:42:12,169
Well...

1081
01:42:13,295 --> 01:42:16,048
...l'm gonna have to leave you
a little message, Ray.

1082
01:42:21,929 --> 01:42:25,057
And it's gonna be loud and clear.

1083
01:42:30,521 --> 01:42:32,397
Just so you never confuse
the difference...

1084
01:42:32,564 --> 01:42:35,442
...between politicians
and warriors, listen up.

1085
01:46:16,872 --> 01:46:20,501
- We need to take out the tree line.
- This is the last missile.

1086
01:46:42,147 --> 01:46:45,526
There she is. She made it.

1087
01:47:38,662 --> 01:47:39,872
Ben!

1088
01:47:41,498 --> 01:47:43,375
Kara, get down! Get down!

1089
01:48:09,776 --> 01:48:11,778
You came back for me.

1090
01:48:12,571 --> 01:48:14,364
You came back.

1091
01:48:23,081 --> 01:48:25,167
We have to get across
the border. Ready?

1092
01:48:25,334 --> 01:48:26,793
Yeah.

1093
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:51,068
Go! Go! Whatever you do,
keep going. Keep going! Go!

1094
01:49:25,227 --> 01:49:26,895
Goodbye.

1095
01:49:34,069 --> 01:49:36,321
Come on. Come on.

1096
01:50:01,889 --> 01:50:03,765
They're ours. They're ours.

1097
01:50:03,932 --> 01:50:06,351
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1098
01:50:20,657 --> 01:50:22,201
Come on.

1099
01:50:35,756 --> 01:50:38,467
The souls of the just
are in the hands of God...

1100
01:50:38,675 --> 01:50:40,886
...where no torment
shall touch them.

1101
01:50:41,053 --> 01:50:43,305
Lieutenant Purcell
has passed through...

1102
01:50:43,472 --> 01:50:46,558
...the darkening and turbulent
storms of this life.

1103
01:50:46,725 --> 01:50:51,897
He now rests in peace,
in the fair sunlight of God's presence.

1104
01:50:52,064 --> 01:50:54,233
In the Navy hymn, we sing:

1105
01:50:54,399 --> 01:50:59,571
"Lord, guard and guide those who fly
through the great spaces in the sky."

1106
01:50:59,738 --> 01:51:01,323
And salute!

1107
01:51:18,298 --> 01:51:21,051
Ready. Hut!

1108
01:51:38,610 --> 01:51:40,195
When I was gonna
detach formation...

1109
01:51:40,362 --> 01:51:43,574
...you said you were gonna
tell me something. You remember?

1110
01:51:50,372 --> 01:51:51,874
You and me, we're...

1111
01:51:52,749 --> 01:51:54,168
We're two.

1112
01:51:56,962 --> 01:51:59,464
And two is a prime number...

1113
01:52:00,007 --> 01:52:03,177
...which makes it a lucky number.

1114
01:52:06,889 --> 01:52:09,600
And I think we're very, very lucky.

1115
01:52:27,117 --> 01:52:30,078
Oh, just tell me you love me,
you pussy.
