00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,296
<i>I am a genius.</i>

3
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:14,262
<i>I am the greatest artist</i>
<i>of the 20th century.</i>

4
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,901
<i>My name is Pablo Picasso.</i>

5
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,412
I pretty much invented modern art.

6
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:23,241
And I do weird, abstract paintings...

7
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,784
...even though I can paint totally
realistic, if I wanted to.

8
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:31,286
Also, even though
I'm super short and bald...

9
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:34,460
...I am able to have sex
with any beautiful woman I want...

10
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,788
...just because I'm so great.

11
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,908
Come here.

12
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,881
Look.

13
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,882
- Pretty good.
- Thanks.

14
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:10,488
Some day, if you get famous,
this can be worth a lot of money.

15
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,697
You're wasting your time, Jerome.

16
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,768
You gotta set your sights
on a more realistic girl.

17
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,132
Shit, here comes Stoob.

18
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,333
Hey, pencil-prick, thanks for helping
me with that poster for Erikson's class.

19
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,104
- He said I was a natural artist.
- A natural scam artist.

20
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,372
Got that right, queer-bait.

21
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,280
What's this?

22
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:35,851
- Are you jacking off in school now?
- It's a college brochure, you moron.

23
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:38,387
What college has a naked chick
for a teacher?

24
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,991
She's an art model, you stupid ape.

25
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:44,090
Hey. You're all right, Platz.

26
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:58,036
I don't know, Jerome. It just seems
a little too good to be true.

27
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:04,572
Don't you think?

28
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,429
Fucking shit!

29
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:13,704
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:17,349
It's based on the whole thing
with the campus murder, but...

31
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,609
Hell no, it ain't
no boring-ass documentary.

32
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,844
Look, forget that shit, okay?

33
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:25,718
Yeah, fucking A, there's gonna
be tons of action, are you kidding me?

34
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,885
- You're an art major?
- Yeah. Drawing and painting.

35
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:34,055
- What are you guys?
- I'm fashion. He's film, I guess.

36
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,861
Are you for real?
You're shitting me, right?

37
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,231
- Well, yeah.
- God, this is so depressing.

38
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,772
- Why, what's wrong?
- I just really, really miss my girlfriend.

39
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:46,411
One hundred percent.
Yeah, you won't be sorry.

40
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,170
I love you too, Grandpa. Yes!

41
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,409
Yes! I'm so fucking pumped!

42
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,517
- I'm Vince.
- Hi. Jerome. How are you?

43
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,351
- What's your name again?
- Matthew.

44
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,184
God, I'm so fucking jazzed.
I get to make my movie.

45
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,921
That's fantastic.

46
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,897
- You guys freshmen?
- Yeah.

47
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,466
- You a sophomore?
- Junior.

48
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,399
It's all right.
You listen to me, you'll be okay.

49
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,596
Why do you still live in the dorm?

50
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:20,412
A lot of juniors still live in the dorm.
What's wrong with that?

51
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,497
That guy's some hot shit
sculpture major.

52
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,900
I have never seen
so many beautiful girls.

53
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:53,175
This is nothing. Dude,
you should've seen last year's crop.

54
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,472
Enrollment's way off
since the murders.

55
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,740
- What murders?
- You're shitting me, right?

56
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:01,147
I heard about it. Somebody killed
a guy on campus, or whatever.

57
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:05,051
Yeah. Three people
in the neighborhood since March.

58
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:10,126
You're fucking with me. You've never
heard about the Strathmore Strangler?

59
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:11,990
He killed a guy, like, 10 days ago.

60
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,063
- Are you from out of state?
- The suburbs.

61
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,235
Then you have no excuse.

62
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,767
What about Richard Natwick?

63
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,766
- Jesus.
- Sorry, I don't really follow the news.

64
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:26,372
Okay, I'm gonna give you the story...
You gotta pay attention.

65
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:30,806
Because this story is huge.
This is, like, national news, man.

66
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,314
I'm listening.

67
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:38,085
Just after the first murder,
there's this guy, Richard Natwick.

68
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,659
<i>He's, like, some second-year</i>
<i>painting major.</i>

69
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,329
<i>Does these stupid-ass</i>
<i>word paintings.</i>

70
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,193
<i>He has a show at the student center.</i>
<i>Cops send some guys to check it out.</i>

71
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,763
<i>But they're not used to</i>
<i>this kind of artsy bullshit, right?</i>

72
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,067
- Fucking...
- Cut your shit.

73
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,104
Get used to being bent over, prick.

74
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,303
So then a couple of professors
freak out.

75
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,210
And before you know it,
he's like a fucking martyr.

76
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,576
Art is not a crime! Art is not a crime!

77
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,347
Of course, it turns out
he's completely innocent.

78
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,786
And the cops have to totally eat shit.

79
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,825
- So, what happened to him?
- He had his 15 minutes of fame.

80
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:19,623
Then he got hurt real bad in
some crazy-ass performance art thing.

81
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,459
Okay...

82
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,032
...hit the juice.

83
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,862
Anyway, you gotta read my script.

84
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,905
I mean, it's all in there.
It's totally huge.

85
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,502
So, what, you don't get the paper
in the suburbs?

86
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:39,351
I mean, for all they know,
the killer could be from the suburbs.

87
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,247
Those cops, they don't know shit.

88
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,322
So, what, you're a drawing major?

89
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,229
Yeah. Drawing and painting.

90
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:54,763
That's awesome.

91
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,834
I hear you guys get to see
tons of naked vagina.

92
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,873
Okay, Leslie.
Time to work your magic.

93
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,439
First pose, people.

94
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,675
We're gonna hit
the ground running.

95
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,211
Okay, first pose.

96
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:19,851
I don't have any particular wisdom
to impart to you people, except this:

97
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,253
These four words:

98
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,055
Don't have unrealistic expectations.

99
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:28,131
If you wanna make money,
better drop out right now.

100
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:32,532
Go to banking school
or website school.

101
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,070
Anywhere but art school.

102
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:38,675
And remember,
only one out of 100 of you...

103
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:42,211
...will ever make a living as an artist.

104
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,969
Hello?

105
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,770
Yes.

106
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,634
Ah, Lorenzo.

107
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:11,571
No. Absolutely, yes...

108
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,575
Sandy, can I get a break up here?

109
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,177
Take a break. Five minutes.

110
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:23,419
Are you kidding? I would absolutely
love to have you look at it.

111
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:31,587
No, because I feel like I've really
turned a corner with this latest series.

112
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,167
In January?

113
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:41,232
Yeah, yeah. I'm sure I could.

114
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,133
I mean, I don't think my plate
is completely full.

115
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,338
Well, I'd be happy...

116
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:52,282
No, of course not.

117
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,388
Hi.

118
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,285
- Really pretty, what you're doing.
- I gotta go.

119
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,175
Jesus.

120
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:23,909
Why are the people in these freshman
classes exactly the same every year?

121
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,481
Look.

122
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,243
You got the vegan holy man.

123
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,912
The boring blowhard.

124
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,491
- The angry lesbian.
- Professor?

125
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,025
Professor? Professor?

126
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,422
And here, you got kiss-ass.

127
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,361
I wanted to tell you that I looked up
some of your paintings on the Internet.

128
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:45,230
- I thought they were really terrific.
- You get an "A" for the class.

129
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,538
And Mom.

130
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:53,267
I feel that I am finally about to ripen.

131
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,912
Artistically.

132
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,842
Mom's youngest just left the nest...

133
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,019
...so she's ready to explore
her creative side.

134
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,687
How do you know all this stuff?

135
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,723
Because I'm a living cliché
just like the rest of these guys.

136
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,418
I'm the guy who keeps dropping out
and changing majors...

137
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,927
...because he's afraid
he really sucks at everything.

138
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,056
So who am I?

139
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,768
I don't know.
I haven't figured you out yet.

140
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,239
Jesus.

141
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,578
Who's the weirdo?

142
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,252
Professor? Professor?

143
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,090
Professor Okamura?

144
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,027
What is your attendance policy
for this class?

145
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,627
I...

146
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,304
...don't...

147
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,030
...care...

148
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,239
...if you come to class or not.

149
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,776
This is ready for the kiln.

150
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,144
Let me see if I got this right:

151
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,583
You're the guy
that never got laid in high school.

152
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,019
So you came here
to try to bone your way through...

153
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:13,851
...an endless lineup of art skanks.

154
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,792
Not exactly. I mean,
I really do wanna be an artist.

155
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,096
A great artist, you know, if possible.

156
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,326
Which enables you to bone your way
through a lineup of art skanks.

157
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,199
So why wait, man?
Art school's like a pussy buffet.

158
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,374
I don't want just any girl.

159
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,273
All right.

160
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,008
There she is.

161
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,979
There is the beautiful beatnik
art chick of your dreams.

162
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,280
- Yeah, so?
- So ask her to borrow something.

163
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,116
It's the easiest thing in the world.

164
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,125
Want me to teach you?
Daddy will bring you there.

165
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,923
- Jesus...
- Come on.

166
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,505
Hi...

167
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,700
Do you think I could borrow
your pencil?

168
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,970
Why?

169
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,978
- What for?
- Doesn't matter, it was a stupid idea.

170
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,741
Oh, my God.

171
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,081
You have the most beautiful eyes.

172
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,356
You have to let me
take a picture of them.

173
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,752
Okay.

174
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,468
How about pizza?
Do you wanna go get pizza?

175
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:51,021
The only trouble with that is all those
beatnik chicks are totally insane.

176
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,927
Look, what you really want is a nice,
innocent, suburban girl.

177
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,688
Some freshman chick
who hasn't been corrupted yet.

178
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,999
Stay out of that cave, Koala Bear.

179
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:09,333
There's snakes and bats.

180
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:15,002
Don't be silly, Pepper.
I'm not afraid of a little snake.

181
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:18,242
You know, come to think of it,
they're all insane.

182
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,045
Just find yourself some nympho slut
and get it over with.

183
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,693
Excuse me.

184
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,522
Can you help me get this off?

185
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,759
I want you to know,
I definitely don't have AIDS.

186
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:39,233
I've been tested, like, 40 times,
so I know it for a fact.

187
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:46,234
Keep the fucking kid quiet,
you motherfucking asshole!

188
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,303
It's just my old man.

189
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,242
Are you serious?

190
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,511
You've never been laid before?

191
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,714
It just hasn't worked out yet.
I have very high standards.

192
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:04,087
Man, I gotta take you out
whore-busting some night.

193
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,094
We gotta remedy this situation
before it gets any worse.

194
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,392
Maybe you have issues
that make it difficult...

195
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:12,695
...to feel comfortable
with your own sexuality.

196
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,930
Could be, I guess.

197
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,506
You guys know what
whore-busting is, right?

198
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,344
You leave the money on the dresser,
fuck the whore and go to sleep.

199
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:26,814
You wake up, not only is your money
still there, but she's left you a tip.

200
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,351
It's the fucking
greatest deal ever, man.

201
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,254
Crackheads aren't so good.

202
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:36,587
Their tip is a little glass pipe
and a piece of tinfoil.

203
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:40,959
You don't want that shit. Get a nice
call girl or something, you know?

204
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,898
You fuck a lot of chicks, Matthew?

205
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,128
Yeah, I figured, man.

206
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,239
Fashion, and all that shit. Models...

207
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:54,340
Crack whores, call girls, strippers...

208
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:58,107
We could bust some strippers
together, that'd be fucking awesome.

209
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,856
What is art?

210
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,789
Is this art?

211
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,728
Or this?

212
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,732
Or this?

213
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,303
Who's that?

214
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,936
Ignore that. That's a mistake.

215
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,512
<i>Hamlet. War and Peace.</i>

216
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,948
"Beethoven's 9th". <i>Guernica</i>.

217
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,646
These are works which hold as much
emotional resonance today...

218
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,949
...as they did at the time
of their creation.

219
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:44,027
What makes a work of art timeless?
What qualities must it possess?

220
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,297
- Yes?
- Everything on your list...

221
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,467
...was done by a dead white male.

222
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,226
I noticed that too.

223
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:55,134
To be clear, they were not yet dead
when they created those works.

224
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,035
You're just playing into
the patriarchy.

225
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:01,144
The history of art is largely about
the implementation of masculinity.

226
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:04,782
- That is such bullshit.
- Part of some Darwinian imperative.

227
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,213
Most artists become artists
because...

228
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,216
...they have no way
to attract a mate.

229
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,889
I hardly think
I'm the first to point out...

230
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:16,494
...that the vast preponderance
of artists are, shall we say...

231
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:19,255
...physiologically deficient
in some way.

232
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:29,770
Dribble the ball, Hurst!

233
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:31,972
Please don't yell.

234
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:34,611
- Going to Marvin Bushmiller's talk?
- Yeah, are you?

235
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,246
We better get there early.

236
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,473
It's weird how he's so famous.

237
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:41,209
I used to see him around Strathmore
when I was a freshman.

238
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,944
I saw his show at Broadway Bob's...

239
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,850
...now he's on
the cover of <i>Artforum</i>.

240
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,117
- Well, that's how it works.
- Platz! Get in there.

241
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,522
Mr. Bushmiller, <i>The New York Times</i>
has called your work:

242
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:00,099
"An expedition to the far contours
of an evolving techno-culture."

243
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:04,537
With that in mind, where do you see
art headed in the 21st century?

244
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,305
"Art" who?

245
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,911
No, really, that's such...

246
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:12,515
...a stupid question.

247
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:15,050
Why don't you
ask me something relevant.

248
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,553
Ask me how much money I have
in the bank, or...

249
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,791
Did you learn anything
at Strathmore?

250
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,692
Yes, I learned many things.

251
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,891
I learned that the faculty
is made up of old failures...

252
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,900
...who teach only because
they need the health insurance.

253
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,436
Present company excluded,
of course.

254
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,871
I was about to say.

255
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:44,039
David was too busy trolling the halls
for fresh meat to worry about health.

256
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,848
What advice would you give
to a young artist...

257
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:54,890
Shut up. There's only one question
any of you wanna ask.

258
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:58,859
You wanna know what it would take
to turn you into me.

259
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,697
Well, listen closely, because
I'm gonna give you the answer.

260
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:07,000
In order to be a great artist...

261
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:11,836
...you simply have to be
a great artist.

262
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:16,572
There's nothing to learn, so you're all
wasting your time. Go home.

263
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,514
Why are you such an asshole?

264
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,790
Now, that's a great question.
No, it really is.

265
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:31,556
I am an asshole
because that is my true nature.

266
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,455
Maybe it's everybody's true nature.

267
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,759
Every one of you looks like
a fucking asshole, but who knows?

268
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,903
The difference between
you and me is that...

269
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:42,938
...I have gained the freedom
to express my true nature.

270
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:47,473
And what could be more beautiful
than truth and freedom?

271
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,219
Another day, another dollar.

272
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,552
Hello, Larry.

273
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,189
Oh, by the way...

274
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:09,663
...are you and Lois gonna be free
the night of January 18th?

275
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:11,799
How the hell should I know?

276
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:15,235
Well, I have to do
this little gallery thing.

277
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,341
Lorenzo Massengale
has been torturing me...

278
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,837
...to put my new series of paintings
in his new space...

279
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:27,508
...and I just thought maybe you
and Lois would want an invitation.

280
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,984
I think I'm busy that night, Sandiford.

281
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:40,496
Here, I stopped off at Broadway Bob's.
You're welcome.

282
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,996
I thought Broadway Bob's
was an art gallery or something.

283
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:47,501
It's a very famous shithole
run by an obnoxious windbag...

284
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:50,675
...who takes credit for the career
of every half-talented monkey...

285
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:53,504
...who ever took a class
at Strathmore.

286
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,339
But the coffee's good.

287
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,511
Hello, Lorenzo, it's Sandy.

288
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:03,780
Just wanted to make sure
you got the slides and...

289
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:08,022
You don't need to call me,
because I have a class starting.

290
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:11,320
So I will call you afterwards.

291
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,963
Thanks. Bye.

292
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:15,832
Sorry I'm late.

293
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:17,896
Hello, dear.

294
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,638
Looks like this is our lucky day.

295
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,140
I'm sorry, Sandy,
I'm just dying for a cigarette.

296
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:14,375
Yes, absolutely.
Five-minute break.

297
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,284
I'm gonna go to the john.

298
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,189
Let me borrow this.

299
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:25,590
All right.

300
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,821
She smiled at you, how sweet.

301
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,525
You've seen her before?
Who is she?

302
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:05,192
Don't get your hopes up.
She's prime real estate, my friend.

303
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:06,927
Hey, faggots.

304
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,133
What a cute couple.

305
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:11,264
I think they like us.

306
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,607
- Is she a student or just a model?
- Can we forget about her for a minute?

307
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,510
We're about to have
a life-changing experience here.

308
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:34,622
Jimmy, it's Bardo.

309
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,596
Brought someone over to meet you.

310
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,905
I got a bottle of Slivovitz here.

311
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:54,108
It's 80 proof, made in Poland,
imported by...

312
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:05,720
Boys, welcome.

313
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:12,262
I'm afraid you've interrupted me
in the middle of one of my shows.

314
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:13,966
This is Jerome.

315
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:17,064
Hi, nice to meet you.
Thank you for having us.

316
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:18,806
A pleasure.

317
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,372
Isn't this a great place?

318
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,513
Jimmy's got rent control.

319
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,919
So Jerome here...

320
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:39,994
...wants to be a great artist, Jimmy.

321
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,232
How terrific.

322
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:49,836
Jerome, are you exceptionally skilled
as a cocksucker?

323
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,673
It wasn't a rhetorical question.

324
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:56,506
Are you a great artist
when it comes to fellatio?

325
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,118
No.

326
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:05,846
No, I guess not.

327
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:08,917
Well, that's no good.

328
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,532
So who do you like?

329
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,966
Who's your favorite artist, Jerome?

330
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,882
- Maybe Picasso.
- I see.

331
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,482
Very good.

332
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,716
Our old friend...

333
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:38,479
..."pick-asshole."

334
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:41,285
The nasty little dwarf
who went his whole life...

335
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,654
...without a single original thought.

336
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,031
I presume you're joking, right?

337
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,564
Jimmy's a Strathmore grad.

338
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,768
Just look at me now.

339
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:01,072
Just think, Jerome.
One day, this could all be yours.

340
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,340
You're going places, young man.
I can feel it.

341
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:08,916
But you need to take some lessons
in sucking cock and licking ass.

342
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,079
Otherwise, you might find yourself
rotting away in some shithole...

343
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:18,118
...postponing suicide for the slim
chance that you might one day...

344
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:22,060
...possibly see some glorious plague
or pestilence...

345
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:25,498
...bring horrible suffering
to your hateful species.

346
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,105
What are you smiling about?

347
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:36,246
Laugh away, laughing boy!

348
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:39,443
I will stomp your guts
till they shoot out your ass!

349
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:43,246
I will bury you alive
and shit on your grave!

350
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,259
Okay, boys. Show's over.

351
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,902
I have to get back
to my masturbation.

352
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,947
Isn't Jimmy great?

353
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:13,741
Yeah, definitely.

354
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:20,490
Self-portrait.

355
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:27,627
Starting next week...

356
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:32,531
...I will be selecting the most effective
work from each session...

357
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,796
...and placing it in the hall gallery.

358
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,304
- Which gallery?
- It's on this floor.

359
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:40,478
- Down at the end of the hall.
- By the men's toilet?

360
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,007
Yes.

361
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,178
Now, let's get started on these.

362
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:47,783
Who wants to comment?

363
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,887
I like Flower's drawing.

364
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,484
- Yeah. Me too.
- It seems like she's trying to do...

365
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:57,354
...something more
than just draw herself.

366
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,462
It's more about
the process of drawing.

367
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:09,064
All right. Does anything else up here
command your attention?

368
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:17,648
Does anyone have anything more
to say on Flower's piece?

369
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,319
Yes, Jerome?

370
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:27,581
- Nothing.
- Well, "nothing" doesn't exist...

371
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:30,556
...in this classroom.
What are you thinking?

372
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,223
We're waiting, Jerome.

373
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,801
I don't know. It just...

374
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:43,738
It looks like a lame
Cy Twombly imitation to me.

375
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:46,410
It looks like she did it
in about two minutes.

376
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:50,711
That is such bullshit.

377
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:53,611
Because her drawing isn't perfect,
it's automatically bad?

378
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:55,547
At least it has humanity.

379
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:57,186
Yeah, totally.

380
00:30:57,388 --> 00:31:00,255
Jerome, your drawing looks like
it was done by a machine.

381
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,827
Whereas Flower's...

382
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,325
Flower's is full of playfulness and...

383
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,828
Yeah, like, humanity.

384
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:12,096
What's so great about humanity?

385
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:16,365
Humans are a bunch of jerks.
I hope a plague wipes out the species.

386
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:19,236
- What is your problem?
- Jesus Christ, Jerome.

387
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,573
Okay, that's enough.

388
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,272
This is a required assignment.
I have to give it to you.

389
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:31,046
And, Flower, it is certainly
not worth crying about, okay?

390
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,532
Hey, man.

391
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:48,204
I agree with you 100 percent.

392
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:53,909
I think the entire human race should
be wiped off the face of the earth.

393
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,972
Oh, I didn't really mean... I was just...

394
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:59,046
You don't have to apologize.

395
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,013
I'm totally with you on this.

396
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,552
So this is the hall gallery.

397
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:13,260
Hey.

398
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:16,024
You guys have to come
to my opening tonight.

399
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:19,565
You were really an asshole
in class today.

400
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,270
Hey. You guys.

401
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:29,107
So are we gonna go see
Shilo's opening?

402
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:32,748
- How did she ever get a gallery show?
- It's totally meaningless.

403
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,385
Any idiot could sign up
for a student gallery.

404
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:37,782
Oh, my God.

405
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:40,285
What?

406
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:44,850
I didn't notice that.
We gotta go.

407
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:53,465
Great work, Shilo.

408
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,058
Hey.

409
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,620
Do you know this girl?

410
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:24,327
Yeah. We had her as a model.
Remember?

411
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:27,129
But do you know who she is?
Do you know her name?

412
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,167
You are such a prick.

413
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:36,905
What? You can't say anything nice
about my photos?

414
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:41,383
- Hi.
- Hi.

415
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:42,985
That came out really good.

416
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,788
- Thank you.
- Shilo.

417
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,356
What?

418
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,354
Oh, hi. I'm Audrey, by the way.

419
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,029
So is that your real name?

420
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:57,031
Or are you just obsessed with Audrey
Hepburn like every art school chick?

421
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:58,998
I was named after an old cartoon.

422
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:03,672
Another ironic pop culture reference.

423
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:05,899
She's a keeper.

424
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,806
- Hey.
- God, do you know that guy?

425
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,909
- No. I thought he was your friend.
- No way.

426
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,384
Oh, you're the guy
from Sandy's class.

427
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,719
I have such a bad memory for faces.
I'm sorry.

428
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,192
That's okay. I'm Jerome.

429
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,592
I was thinking about you today.

430
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,961
I saw an old photo
of Marie-Thérèse Walter...

431
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:33,569
...and it looked just like the way
that you drew me.

432
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:39,133
She's one of the women
who modeled for Picasso.

433
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,436
I know just the picture
you're talking about.

434
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,045
You do?

435
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,275
Let's get out of here.

436
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:53,112
What? I said I liked your photos.

437
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,092
- You didn't have to do that.
- It's okay.

438
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:59,127
I couldn't bear to watch you
get cornered by that creep again.

439
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:05,062
Well, I have to get going anyway.
I'm kind of making the rounds tonight.

440
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,638
Really?
Well, maybe sometime we could...

441
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:13,366
I have to go to
a Donald Baumgarten show.

442
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:16,445
Oh, I know who he is.
He's an old pop art guy, right?

443
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:18,808
Yeah, he's really good. He's great.

444
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:24,314
He's absolutely awful.
But I can't get out of it.

445
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,382
Do you wanna go with me?

446
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:33,790
Come on, please.
I hate to take the subway by myself.

447
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:37,092
Especially with that weirdo
out there strangling everybody.

448
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:41,566
A little bit. Well, my parents go a lot.

449
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,235
Hi.

450
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,640
Audrey, I was afraid
you weren't coming.

451
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:51,939
So how's it going?

452
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,017
Well, I think I might have sold
two of the small ones.

453
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:58,211
- The ones you hate.
- I like them just fine. You know that.

454
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:00,515
Just not as much
as the big, blue ones.

455
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,186
I know.

456
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:04,554
Daddy, this is Jerome.

457
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:07,456
Jerome is a big fan of yours.
I brought him to meet you.

458
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,462
Jerome, this is Donald Baumgarten.

459
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:14,802
Wow. I'm a big fan of yours, sir.
It's really a pleasure.

460
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,199
My pleasure, son.

461
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:19,433
Daddy, I hate to do this,
but I don't think we can stay.

462
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:23,341
Jerome has to meet someone
at another party, and we're late, so...

463
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,845
- Will I see you on Sunday?
- I'll call you.

464
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,251
I can't believe you grew up
with a dad like that.

465
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:39,152
He's a famous artist.

466
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:42,465
He's hardly a famous artist.

467
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,730
It's really heartbreaking.

468
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,667
He should've given up, like,
30 years ago.

469
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,066
God, I am starving.

470
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:51,070
- Should we go eat somewhere?
- Sure.

471
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,106
Have you ever heard
of Broadway Bob's?

472
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:00,008
So why are you a model?
Just for the money?

473
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,050
Oh, yeah. I make a fortune.

474
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:05,914
My God, is that who I think it is?

475
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:07,590
He's always here.

476
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:10,761
That table is practically reserved
for post-minimalists.

477
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:13,260
This is where everybody gets
their first big show.

478
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:16,490
It's like the launching pad
from Strathmore to the real world.

479
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:20,602
- How do they pick who gets a show?
- They go to the surveys and all that.

480
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:24,540
What's the matter?
Don't you love me anymore?

481
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,835
When's the last time
you came to see me?

482
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:29,411
Jerome, this is Broadway Bob.

483
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:31,303
- How you doing?
- Hi.

484
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:33,244
Bob knows everybody.

485
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:39,515
Every artist you can think of
had their first show in this place.

486
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,659
Bushmiller, Naugle, Bilbo,
you name it.

487
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,761
The minute they get famous,
they got no time for me, right?

488
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:49,623
Hey! I told you to stop hassling
my customers!

489
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:52,394
Hector! Fucking Brown Shirts.

490
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:54,399
What are you doing?

491
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:57,235
- Good to see you.
- Bye.

492
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,204
- Tell your father I said hi.
- Okay.

493
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,970
- Hey. Excuse me.
- Yeah, what?

494
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,704
You wanna help me out?
I got two homeless fucks outside...

495
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:07,941
...that panhandle all day.
They bother my customers outside.

496
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,780
This kid's not a serial killer.
Look at that guy out there.

497
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:13,479
- Just get the fuck out.
- All right, let's go.

498
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,750
- Your coffee sucks.
- Go to Starbucks.

499
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,388
Who's this?

500
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:25,600
- Jerome, this is Candace.
- Hi, how are you? Nice to meet you.

501
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,934
Audrey and I used to bump cunts.

502
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:31,902
Just kidding.

503
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:35,676
But little Audrey doesn't wanna play
with me anymore, does she.

504
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,680
What do you think
of these paintings?

505
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:45,548
They're okay.
I mean, they're not the most...

506
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:46,950
They're Candace's paintings.

507
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:51,055
- They're really good.
- Where do you find them, Audrey?

508
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:55,858
Anyway, thanks to this little exhibit,
I'll get a spring show at the Haberman.

509
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:59,794
- That's really great. Congratulations.
- I know. Golly gosh!

510
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:03,030
- You. Get over here.
- Later, kids.

511
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:08,169
What's this I hear about a show at
Haberman? You gotta let me know...

512
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:12,707
So, what do you wanna do, Jerome?

513
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:16,749
I wanna be the greatest artist
of the 21st century.

514
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:21,422
Oh, I just meant,
"What do you wanna do now?"

515
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:22,922
I should probably get home.

516
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:26,095
- I'm stupid...
- No, no, I think it's great.

517
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,597
I think you really could be
a great artist.

518
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,030
You have the right kind of...

519
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:33,703
...energy.

520
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,043
- You won't believe...
- Did you hear the news?

521
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:50,618
- No, but guess where I was?
- The strangler got another one.

522
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:54,120
Some poor schmuck on his way to
the subway. I got a major rewrite to do.

523
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:58,491
- I was on the subway tonight.
- You're lucky to be alive.

524
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:01,756
- Anyway, guess what I was doing.
- Smoking pole?

525
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:05,298
No, I was on a date with the most
beautiful girl in the whole school.

526
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:07,937
All right. Can I smell your finger?

527
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:16,406
Look.

528
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:20,943
No shit.

529
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:25,249
- Nice.
- Yeah. She thinks I'm a great artist.

530
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:28,050
You fucking snake.
What the fuck are you doing here?

531
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,487
Did you already pop her?

532
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:32,923
No, I...

533
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,430
- You know, we just met...
- Man, if she was my girlfriend...

534
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:42,765
...I would be pounding that shit
day and night.

535
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,802
November 28th.

536
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,210
November 28th.

537
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,143
Try and keep that date...

538
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:55,512
...in your tiny, little,
drug-addled brains.

539
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:59,815
That is the date of
the post-Thanksgiving assessment...

540
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,083
...where you'll put up all your work...

541
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,091
...and a bunch of us professors
are gonna sneak in...

542
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:09,858
...behind your backs
and give you a grade.

543
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:15,061
However, that is but a mere prelude
to this day:

544
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,638
December 19th.

545
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:23,275
December 19th is the final survey
where you will receive...

546
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:27,076
...your one-and-only official grade
for this class...

547
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:30,811
...provided, of course, you all
haven't been murdered by then.

548
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:37,189
I heard the final survey
is where big-shot gallery owners...

549
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:38,952
...show up to troll for new talent.

550
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,723
I wouldn't worry about that
too much right now.

551
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:44,025
This could be a big break
for somebody.

552
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:48,865
But this is not Schwab's drugstore.
You are definitely not Lana Turner.

553
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:52,600
- What does that mean?
- It means you children are too young...

554
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,505
...to be worrying about that.

555
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:58,148
Now, Eno, why haven't you
been doing the assignments?

556
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,716
Frankly, I find them constricting
and largely irrelevant.

557
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:05,150
My work has nothing to do
with form or light or color...

558
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:09,224
...but with questioning the nature
of aesthetic experience.

559
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:12,861
I'll buy that.

560
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:16,897
- Jonah, what about you?
- I'll bring something next time. Sorry.

561
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:19,602
I also heard that the student
with the best grade...

562
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:23,637
...gets a show at Broadway Bob's.
- That's been known to happen, yes.

563
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:27,538
Professor Okamura said no one in
your class ever got the best grade.

564
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:34,216
Well, Larry seems to care about
that kind of thing a lot more than I do.

565
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:39,548
And Larry has a tendency to live
vicariously through his students...

566
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:42,419
...which I find rather pathetic.

567
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:45,254
I also heard they're cutting faculty,
and all the profs...

568
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:48,659
...are shitting bricks trying to get
a student to the Broadway Bob show.

569
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:52,858
Actually. I'm too busy
concentrating on my own painting...

570
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,597
...to get involved with
any kind of faculty intrigue.

571
00:42:56,807 --> 00:43:00,436
Is it true Marvin Bushmiller got his
break when he got the best grade?

572
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,859
Audrey.

573
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:19,359
Hi.

574
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:21,994
I just came in to get a coffee.

575
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:25,896
I have to model for
Professor Bogle's class at 6:30.

576
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,037
Can I walk with you?

577
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:30,700
God, you're so polite. Sure.

578
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:40,778
<i>Look at you.</i>

579
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:44,284
<i>So content with your happy,</i>
<i>little lives.</i>

580
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:47,924
<i>But none of you know the taste</i>
<i>of true happiness...</i>

581
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:52,061
<i>... the happiness that</i>
<i>only death can bring.</i>

582
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:57,256
<i>I am hell on earth, personified!</i>

583
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:06,835
What do you think?
Should I trim that last part?

584
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,508
How much longer you gonna be?

585
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:16,650
It's up to the boss.

586
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:21,022
See you later.

587
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:25,487
Hey, hey, hey. You can't just leave.

588
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,498
What do you think
of the movie so far?

589
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:32,664
- It's fine.
- Yeah. Thanks.

590
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:37,034
She doesn't get this kind of stuff.
I wouldn't worry about it.

591
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:39,966
I gotta cram some love story
into this thing, man.

592
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:43,340
Those skags make up 50 percent
of the audience.

593
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:52,748
You're missing the best part.

594
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:55,922
Hey.

595
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:07,904
Now...

596
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:11,268
...we're not gonna have any more
official assignments in this class.

597
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:16,139
Last week, I asked you to bring in
what you thought was your...

598
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,583
...best work of art, old or new. Okay?

599
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:23,514
And we're gonna use that work...

600
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:27,350
...as a starting point to, hopefully,
help you become better artists.

601
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,118
"We live in a police state."

602
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,391
Ain't that the truth.

603
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,499
This is interesting.

604
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:41,227
That's not finished, but I thought
the class might find it interesting...

605
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,998
...to see the various stages
of my process.

606
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:46,569
Indeed.

607
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:51,610
And what have we here?

608
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:06,657
- Who did this?
- That's mine.

609
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,134
Where have you been all my life?

610
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:18,905
- What do we think of this work, class?
- It's so...

611
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:23,705
It's like, he figured out how to unlearn
all the typical art school bullshit.

612
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:25,245
It's really great.

613
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:30,476
It has the singularity of outsider art,
though the conscious rejection...

614
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:33,747
...of spatial dynamics
could only come from an intimacy...

615
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:36,357
...with the conventions
of picture-making.

616
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,686
Are you kidding me?

617
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,260
You look at?

618
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:12,758
Professor Okamura, what are some
of your favorite Halloween memories?

619
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:17,065
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

620
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:20,632
You want a drink? There's some
weird orange punch over there.

621
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:23,999
- Yeah. That's really sweet. Thank you.
- Okay.

622
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:34,714
Better get back there. You're about
to get cock-blocked by Joe College.

623
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:36,647
How did you do that painting?

624
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:39,345
It's like you've never seen
another painting before.

625
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:41,421
What the fuck?

626
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:47,722
My God, we look like
Bonnie and Clyde.

627
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,793
Oh, thanks.

628
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:53,834
Isn't it weird?
Look how perfectly we match.

629
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:59,698
- That's great.
- There's an empty seat over there.

630
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,297
Looks like a duel.

631
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:23,693
No? Comments?

632
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,995
Jonah's seems totally original
and authentic.

633
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:29,729
And Jerome's just seems lame.

634
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:33,772
It's pathetic. No offense.

635
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:36,138
Yeah, it's like Jonah is tapping...

636
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:38,473
...into this total childhood innocence.

637
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:41,981
He's got a whole way of seeing
that's completely outside the box.

638
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:44,653
And Jerome is totally in the box,
you know?

639
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:47,983
- Yeah. It sucks.
- You know, Jerome's is really...

640
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:52,719
Okay, I think that's fine.
We shouldn't be too hard on Jerome.

641
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:57,196
Jerome's trying to do something
that is essentially impossible.

642
00:48:57,401 --> 00:49:00,268
He's trying to sing in his own voice...

643
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,768
...using someone else's
vocal chords.

644
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:03,890
I mean, it's the greatest.
He picks a completely random victim.

645
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:06,968
I mean, this chick was, like...

646
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,331
She was, like,
a cashier or something.

647
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:13,100
- How do they know it's the same guy?
- Come on, it's obvious.

648
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:15,710
There's a million clues.
For one thing, he always...

649
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:18,779
- Okay, I believe you.
- Look at her.

650
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:21,951
She was only 31 years old.

651
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:25,652
I mean, it's like a goddamn miracle.

652
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:27,855
Here I am, busting my nuts...

653
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:30,549
...trying to find some female character
for my movie...

654
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:33,423
...and this guy goes and drops
one right in my lap.

655
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:36,832
Murder?

656
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,901
Don't worry so much, man.
No one's gonna murder me.

657
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:45,097
I don't want nothing
to happen to my best ho.

658
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:48,106
The streets ain't safe no more.
Not since...

659
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:49,403
Fuck you.

660
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:53,446
You're just trying to keep me down,
and I am not your whore any more.

661
00:50:57,921 --> 00:50:59,183
I mean...

662
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:03,760
I'm not your whore no more.

663
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,329
This is total shit, you know that?

664
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:11,233
No, I don't know that.

665
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:15,030
Come on. All of this "gangsta,"
"motherfucker" bullshit.

666
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:19,072
Why do you wanna regurgitate this
Hollywood crap for the zillionth time?

667
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:21,676
Don't you have anything original
to say?

668
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:25,938
- I think I do.
- Then you need to say it.

669
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:30,112
Because this is
completely worthless.

670
00:51:41,998 --> 00:51:44,592
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi. It's Jerome Platz.

671
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:48,396
- Hey, Jerome Platz.
<i>- Hey, I was just calling...</i>

672
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:50,503
To... I've got...

673
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:53,801
I've gotta go home for Thanksgiving,
and I was wondering...

674
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:57,571
...if you had any plans, if, maybe,
you wanted to come with me...

675
00:51:57,814 --> 00:52:01,773
Unfortunately, I have to go up north
to visit my grandmother.

676
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:04,316
<i>- But that's really nice of you.</i>
- No...

677
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:06,250
Don't be silly.

678
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,788
Have a great time.
I'll talk to you soon.

679
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:11,550
- Okay. Bye.
<i>- Take care. Bye.</i>

680
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:29,437
I think maybe I'll go on tour
with Dominick's band this summer.

681
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:33,673
They're playing shows in the Midwest.
They need someone to sell T-shirts.

682
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:35,374
Who's Dominick?

683
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:38,520
This guy, who's friends
with Stacy's big brother.

684
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:41,384
- Forget about it.
- God, you are so unfair.

685
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:44,890
Jerome gets to go to art school,
and I can't go on a summer trip.

686
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:48,929
You gonna get a job doing paintings
somewhere once school's done?

687
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:51,659
That's not really how it works.

688
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:53,961
Who in their right mind would buy
your paintings?

689
00:52:54,204 --> 00:52:57,503
- Cynthia.
- God, you love Jerome more than me.

690
00:52:58,441 --> 00:52:59,635
You know what you gotta do?

691
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:02,845
Figure out who's the top guy in your
business and hook up with him.

692
00:53:03,046 --> 00:53:05,571
It's not what you do
so much as who you know.

693
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:09,081
That's how it is in my business,
and it's all about business.

694
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:14,580
Yeah. Actually, I've kind of
made a connection already.

695
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:18,557
My girlfriend's dad
is kind of a famous artist, so...

696
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:20,593
- Your what?
- Hugh...

697
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:23,322
...help me get the rest of the pies
out of the oven?

698
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:36,769
We thought for sure
you were a homo.

699
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:48,423
My friend's granddaughter paints
little pictures on the shoes...

700
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:50,252
Oh, what do you call them?

701
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:55,523
Anyhow, she paints pictures
of little animals and whatnot.

702
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:59,928
And I believe the other children
pay her for it.

703
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,432
"Sneakers."

704
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,601
Isn't that what they call them?

705
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:11,213
Anyhow, that's something
I thought you could do, Jeremy.

706
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:29,654
It's not that at all. It's just that,
I really felt that they were...

707
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:34,735
...some of, really, the best things
I'd done in a very long time.

708
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,428
And I'm just...

709
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:40,335
And I'm just slightly...

710
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:42,710
...surprised that...

711
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:48,144
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

712
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:56,818
I'm Helena Sandiford.
Sandy will be right with you.

713
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:01,487
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate...

714
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:06,458
No, I do. I do understand.

715
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,265
No. Not at all.

716
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:13,334
And I really appreciate
you looking at the slides.

717
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:15,238
Yeah.

718
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:16,639
And you.

719
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:18,279
Bye.

720
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:21,946
Go fuck yourself, Lorenzo!

721
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:39,565
Those are mine, yes.

722
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:42,299
They're really good.

723
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:45,097
Yes, I rather like them.

724
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:49,472
Unfortunately, we're not
in the majority, Jerome.

725
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:54,111
Apparently, they're a little too "difficult"
for some people.

726
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:57,678
So how long have you been
doing the triangles?

727
00:55:58,588 --> 00:55:59,885
A long time.

728
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,324
I was one of the first.

729
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:09,664
So tell me, Jerome...

730
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:12,164
...what are you not getting
out of my class?

731
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,337
I don't know. I feel like...

732
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:18,069
...I don't really know
what I'm doing and...

733
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:21,205
Maybe I should be finding
my own style...

734
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:23,276
...or voice or something.

735
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,778
That is absolute bullshit.

736
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:29,816
What would an artist at your age
want with a style?

737
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:35,053
What about Jonah?
He's got sort of a style.

738
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:39,558
No, Jonah doesn't have a style.
He has a sort of "nowness."

739
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:42,254
It's exciting. It's seductive.

740
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:45,628
But that does not mean, Jerome...

741
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:49,362
...that he is a better artist than you are.
Far from it.

742
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:52,001
You're very similar to me.

743
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:54,642
It is going to take you
a very long time...

744
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:56,368
...to get where you're going.

745
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:59,047
Look, do you have any idea...

746
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,717
...how long it took me
to paint like this?

747
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:08,886
- No.
- Twenty-five years.

748
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:13,484
Jerome, it is absolutely essential
at your age...

749
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:16,790
...that you start to experiment
with all the arts...

750
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,834
...all the philosophies
and all the lifestyles.

751
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:24,905
So, that's what you think I should do,
is try a bunch of different styles...

752
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,201
...and see where it takes me?

753
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:31,403
Yes, yes and yes, Jerome.

754
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:35,607
- Okay.
- I have seen so many young artists...

755
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:40,552
...get locked into
this incredibly rigid way of thinking.

756
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:45,756
So that's what I should try to do,
is experiment?

757
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:50,198
Absolutely.

758
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,666
And I am here to facilitate
that experimentation...

759
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:56,998
...in any way I can...

760
00:57:57,207 --> 00:58:00,199
...either in or out of the classroom.

761
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:04,671
Thank you, professor.

762
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:01,827
For the last time, come on, get out.

763
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,200
Get out of my building.

764
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:25,319
He says they're all done.
We can go in now.

765
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:31,151
<i>Too experimental.</i>

766
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:33,158
<i>You're all over the map.</i>

767
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:35,126
<i>No focus.</i>

768
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:37,265
<i>Hollow and derivative.</i>

769
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:39,492
<i>You need to be yourself.</i>

770
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:41,329
What's up, Platz?

771
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:43,335
- Hey.
- Hey.

772
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:51,703
So are you going
to Marvin Bushmiller's opening?

773
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:55,307
No. I didn't even know about it.

774
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:00,189
It might be an invite-only thing.

775
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:02,620
It's probably done
through his gallery.

776
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:06,185
- I'm sure it'll be a total drag, anyway.
- When is it?

777
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,324
I don't even know.

778
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:10,330
- Hey.
- Hey.

779
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:12,262
I can't believe it.

780
01:01:14,937 --> 01:01:16,370
I got an "A."

781
01:01:16,606 --> 01:01:18,073
Everybody got an "A".

782
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:22,074
It's a total scam to trick everybody
into feeling good about themselves.

783
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:25,475
Yeah, well, I never got better
than a "C" in my whole life.

784
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:27,012
That's hard to believe.

785
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:31,184
Yeah, well, guess I didn't go
to class too much.

786
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:34,185
- I was too busy getting into trouble.
- Really.

787
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:37,386
Yeah, me too.

788
01:01:39,762 --> 01:01:41,320
No kidding.

789
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:45,365
Did you grow up in the city?

790
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,736
Well, not right in the city.

791
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,467
But I came here all the time.

792
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:56,509
All the fucking time.
Practically lived here.

793
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:57,975
So...

794
01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:00,014
...how about it, dude?

795
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:03,183
You got any deep, dark secrets
we should know about?

796
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:25,897
<i>Forgive me!</i>

797
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,391
What the hell was that?

798
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:50,494
Don't worry, it's a totally rough cut.
That's a temp score without...

799
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,863
I thought you were gonna make
a nice little murder picture...

800
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:59,098
...but, here, you got the worms
and the dancing...

801
01:02:59,308 --> 01:03:03,142
- Did you like it?
- It's symbolism, Grandpa.

802
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:07,749
And where are the guns?
I thought this was a shoot-them-up.

803
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:11,283
The guy's a strangler, Grandpa.
What am I supposed to do?

804
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:13,079
I want guns.

805
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:16,789
The movie is called,
<i>The Strathmore Strangler.</i>

806
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:19,291
You want the strangler
to shoot people?

807
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:23,029
I paid for a movie with guns.

808
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:28,265
Hello, Torsiello Gallery.
I can put you on the pre-waiting list.

809
01:03:31,073 --> 01:03:32,973
It's not working. Do it better.

810
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:37,070
Excuse me.

811
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:39,144
We're closed.

812
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:43,478
I heard that Mr. Bushmiller
was having a party tonight.

813
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:45,347
And I was just wondering
if there was...

814
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,283
Sorry. Invite only.

815
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:52,159
I was gonna make up some elaborate
lie, but I decided to be honest.

816
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:55,728
I'm desperate. I'm not crazy.
I won't even talk to Mr. Bushmiller.

817
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:58,423
You see how busy I am here?

818
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,507
Please.

819
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:10,439
Please.

820
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:15,180
Did you put any grenadine in this?

821
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:17,280
I'm new to this. I'm sorry.

822
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:21,484
I'd like a Martell.

823
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,253
There you go.

824
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,895
I heard that Marvin needed some help,
so I figured, why not?

825
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:40,833
I'll have a...

826
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:43,770
I'm just gonna take one of these.

827
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:45,812
Just a Bud is fine.

828
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:48,406
We have...

829
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:50,749
Hoegaarden...

830
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:52,545
...or Stella Artois.

831
01:04:55,825 --> 01:04:57,122
The first one.

832
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,266
You look pretty busy, so...

833
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:14,298
I drink Slivovitz, not Sambuca.

834
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:17,532
You were right about art.

835
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:22,402
It's all about the cock-sucking.

836
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:25,546
It's not what you do,
but who you blow.

837
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:27,511
And even that's not enough.

838
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:32,421
You don't even have a chance,
unless you're the most ruthless...

839
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:34,521
...cold-blooded...

840
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:41,623
Jesus, I'm really sorry.

841
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:53,034
Have you heard about
the great man's latest masterpiece?

842
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:55,903
- No.
- Some of his finest work, I believe.

843
01:06:56,112 --> 01:06:57,545
Damn good stuff.

844
01:06:58,414 --> 01:07:00,473
Who? The murderer?

845
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:02,550
"The murderer"?

846
01:07:03,586 --> 01:07:05,315
That's so disrespectful.

847
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:11,449
Got a few victims for him,
if he's interested.

848
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:23,563
Do you wanna see my paintings?

849
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,941
This is my humble tribute
to the great man.

850
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:35,340
He doesn't simply reproduce reality,
like an ordinary idiot artist.

851
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:39,419
He courageously reshapes it
to suit his own needs.

852
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:43,683
And why did our great artist
select these particular victims?

853
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:45,658
Who can say?

854
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:51,365
A real artist knows
when he's found his ideal subject.

855
01:07:54,503 --> 01:07:58,064
Perhaps, this one
was a dishonest cashier.

856
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:03,602
This one might have reminded him
of a domineering aunt.

857
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:07,378
And this one...

858
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:12,177
Maybe he was just too stupid
to be allowed to live.

859
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:18,559
All of humanity is too stupid to live.

860
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:22,597
Fuck them all.

861
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:24,894
My boy.

862
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,862
I say, you can't do anything
really good...

863
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:32,563
...until you truly don't care at all
if you live or die.

864
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:35,141
Kill me right now.
I couldn't care less.

865
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:40,743
It's only when every human misery
is just a big joke...

866
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,578
...that you can finally get
some enjoyment out of this life.

867
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:46,186
I wish someone would kill me
right now.

868
01:08:47,389 --> 01:08:50,415
- Do you want me to kill you?
- Go for it.

869
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:04,534
Well, I guess I'd better be going,
before I throw up on your rug again.

870
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:06,002
Wait.

871
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:11,808
I wanna give you something.

872
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:40,837
- What's this?
- A gift, from me to you.

873
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:46,575
- No, I couldn't.
- You could.

874
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:48,210
You could.

875
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:03,558
Let's see some ID.

876
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,427
ID.

877
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:13,635
Are you drunk?

878
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:15,704
No.

879
01:11:53,742 --> 01:11:55,767
Well, look who's here.

880
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:59,445
One of those.
Where the hell you been all week?

881
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:03,148
Been having a really hard time.

882
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:05,317
Yeah?

883
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:08,780
Well, you should just do
what I always do.

884
01:12:09,024 --> 01:12:12,619
Drop out, and start over again
next semester.

885
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:15,888
This is my third time,
soon to be my fourth.

886
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,664
You don't understand. I'll never have
another chance like this.

887
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:22,359
I can't just...

888
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:23,833
...start over.

889
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,467
I'll never find another Audrey.

890
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:28,870
Don't start with this shit again.

891
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:33,378
Every artist needs a subject,
and she's my perfect subject.

892
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:36,642
- I can't let her slip through my fingers.
- Hey, come on.

893
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:39,252
Let's rescue these art chicks.
That's easy pickings.

894
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:42,583
If I can just come up with something
for that final survey...

895
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:44,725
...she'll forget all about Jonah.

896
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:49,057
- We're gonna miss our chance here.
- I just need to think of something.

897
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:50,595
There they go.

898
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:54,333
What can I do?

899
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:03,138
You know, I think I just figured out
who you are.

900
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:06,872
- Who?
- You're the class douche bag.

901
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:10,512
Thanks for the beer.

902
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:44,752
Oh, please. You can't fall for every guy
who does a halfway-decent painting.

903
01:13:44,953 --> 01:13:46,477
I don't know.

904
01:13:46,789 --> 01:13:48,450
There's something about him.

905
01:13:48,657 --> 01:13:52,957
You don't need any more boyfriends,
you need about 15 years of therapy.

906
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:56,221
I thought you were all mad
for what's-his-name... Jonah.

907
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:01,527
Look...

908
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:03,864
...when this one doesn't work out...

909
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:08,167
...you can always come
crawling back to me.

910
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:04,092
So, looks like you finally
got Jonah on the run.

911
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:06,358
- What do you mean?
- He was asking about...

912
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:10,026
...some painting of yours.
You got a surprise for the final survey?

913
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:44,404
What do you want?

914
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:51,676
I need a big favor.

915
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,906
- I see you've come empty-handed.
- I know. I'm sorry.

916
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:58,348
You must think
I'm the cheapest whore in town.

917
01:15:59,187 --> 01:16:03,647
I'll bring you a case of Slivovitz.
Whatever you want.

918
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:06,453
I just... I wanna buy
the rest of your paintings.

919
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:09,597
- They're not for sale.
- Please, just tell me what you want.

920
01:16:09,798 --> 01:16:12,460
- I don't want anything.
- I'm just fucking lost...

921
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:15,102
- I thought you were an artist.
- I am. I am.

922
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:17,532
You wanna be an artist
or an "aficionado"?

923
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:19,138
An artist.

924
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:21,605
What do you think
an artist cares about?

925
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:24,676
Does he think all day
about fine wines...

926
01:16:25,948 --> 01:16:28,712
...and black-tie affairs...

927
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:32,618
...and what he's gonna say
at the next after-dinner speech?

928
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:39,988
No.

929
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:46,325
He lives only for that narcotic moment
of creative bliss.

930
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:50,299
A moment...

931
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:52,837
...that may come once a decade.

932
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:56,204
Or never at all.

933
01:16:58,046 --> 01:16:59,536
You think I'm wrong?

934
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:02,644
Fuck you.

935
01:17:04,152 --> 01:17:06,017
You know nothing at all
about anything.

936
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:13,790
- Listen, I don't care about fine wines.
- Oh, I know what you want.

937
01:17:15,497 --> 01:17:18,989
If it was me, I'd get my way
by any means possible.

938
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:22,500
I'd grab them by the balls,
and I'd never stop twisting.

939
01:17:24,906 --> 01:17:27,568
Once you're on top,
they're helpless.

940
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:32,302
You've got them squirming
under the toe of your shoe.

941
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:39,750
Would you please put out
that goddamn cigarette...

942
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:42,650
...before you kill me
with your awful smoke!

943
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:44,291
What about the paintings?

944
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:47,620
I don't care, do whatever you want.

945
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:54,720
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

946
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:01,826
I have a confession to make.

947
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:04,236
Yeah?

948
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:07,101
Forget it.

949
01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:09,802
- No, what?
- Nothing. Forget I said anything.

950
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:13,174
- What is it? Some boyfriend problem?
- What? Why?

951
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:17,051
- I don't know. What is it?
- Why did you say that?

952
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:18,549
Do you think I'm gay?

953
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:23,080
- I don't know.
- Really?

954
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:27,053
Yeah. Maybe a little, I guess.

955
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:29,492
Yeah. Well, that's it.

956
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:31,097
That's my confession.

957
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:33,859
I think I'm gay.

958
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:36,665
Okay.

959
01:19:38,874 --> 01:19:40,136
Okay.

960
01:20:00,262 --> 01:20:02,492
I thought you said you were working.

961
01:20:03,498 --> 01:20:05,989
I am working.
I gotta have this done for Monday.

962
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:09,430
It looks fine, Jonah.
It doesn't have to be perfect.

963
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,868
It's got a long way to go.

964
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:15,008
What's gotten into you?
When you were working Narcotics...

965
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:17,371
...you didn't spend your off-hours
smoking crack.

966
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:21,140
And what about your son?
He misses his daddy.

967
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:23,374
Will you get off my ass for once?

968
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:29,189
Lonny and the guys are here,
or are you too busy for them?

969
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:47,173
Well, look who's here. How's
the <i>Mona Lisa</i> coming, Rembrandt?

970
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:50,742
You're off duty, Jonah.
You don't gotta dress like a fruitcake.

971
01:20:50,946 --> 01:20:53,380
Yeah. It's good to see you guys too.

972
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:55,482
How much longer is this gonna
go on, Lonny?

973
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,845
I never see him anymore
since he became an artist.

974
01:20:58,086 --> 01:20:59,951
I'm just trying to do my job.

975
01:21:00,155 --> 01:21:03,522
That's a good question, Marie.
So, what about it, superstar?

976
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:06,193
Hey, we got the blow-ups
of the pictures you took.

977
01:21:06,394 --> 01:21:09,955
He used the same colors we found
on the glove of the first crime scene.

978
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:11,825
I don't know about this guy Platz.

979
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:15,059
He didn't live near the campus
when the first killings took place.

980
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:18,899
He used to come to the city
all the time. He told me so himself.

981
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:21,439
It would've helped
if you had taken a paint sample.

982
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:25,038
You can't just monkey around
with a piece of art like that...

983
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:28,876
"Piece of shit" is more like it.
You take a look at this fucking thing?

984
01:21:29,084 --> 01:21:30,881
Excuse me, Marie.

985
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:34,613
We can't even question this asshole?
It's like he's making fun of us.

986
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:38,919
I'm taking shit to this day
about that first weirdo you dragged in.

987
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:40,856
I can't afford any more fuck-ups.

988
01:21:44,332 --> 01:21:46,357
I need better shit than this, Jonah.

989
01:21:47,469 --> 01:21:49,130
Listen to me, Gerry.

990
01:21:49,971 --> 01:21:51,404
Will you listen to me? Look...

991
01:21:51,606 --> 01:21:53,904
I know you're a genius,
but I'm a genius too.

992
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:56,802
What are you, on vacation?
Move your ass.

993
01:21:57,012 --> 01:22:00,243
Look, this dyke is gonna make us
both a fortune, I'm telling you.

994
01:22:00,448 --> 01:22:01,938
I'm 100 percent on this one.

995
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:05,649
Fine. Don't listen to me.
What do I care?

996
01:22:05,854 --> 01:22:08,516
Don't you ever call me again,
you ungrateful prick.

997
01:22:23,972 --> 01:22:27,100
Excuse me?
I'm in your Tuesday/Thursday class.

998
01:22:28,043 --> 01:22:29,476
Can I ask you a question?

999
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:35,844
So, there's this...

1000
01:22:36,051 --> 01:22:38,986
...freshman survey tomorrow.

1001
01:22:39,888 --> 01:22:41,719
And you wanna know
what you can do...

1002
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:45,518
...to land a big gallery contract
like Marvin Bushmiller.

1003
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:48,661
No. Not exactly.

1004
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:52,128
Perhaps you want a major
retrospective at the Metropolitan?

1005
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:54,961
Actually, there's someone who...

1006
01:22:57,038 --> 01:22:59,131
I don't know. I want her to...

1007
01:23:00,175 --> 01:23:01,506
It's for a girl?

1008
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:02,972
Yeah.

1009
01:23:04,112 --> 01:23:07,639
You wanna take the prize
so you can win the heart of a girl?

1010
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:09,311
Yeah.

1011
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:14,048
That's so exciting.

1012
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:18,654
Think you could look at my paintings
and tell me if they're good enough?

1013
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:20,926
No.

1014
01:23:21,863 --> 01:23:23,922
But I'll be rooting for you.

1015
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:36,509
Hey.

1016
01:23:40,448 --> 01:23:43,110
Think Jonah's getting any gash
on the side?

1017
01:23:43,318 --> 01:23:47,152
No. Marie's got him so pussy-whipped
it's not even funny.

1018
01:23:53,228 --> 01:23:54,627
Hey, hey.

1019
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:57,696
That's our guy.
That's our guy, right there.

1020
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,867
Will you look at him.

1021
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:01,865
I ought to wring his neck
right now.

1022
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:04,903
- What the fuck are we waiting for?
- He couldn't strangle a cat.

1023
01:24:05,106 --> 01:24:07,233
Fucking scumbag!

1024
01:24:08,343 --> 01:24:11,710
Where the fuck is Jonah?
Lonny told him to be on the guy's ass.

1025
01:25:13,374 --> 01:25:15,274
Jesus, that was disappointing.

1026
01:25:15,477 --> 01:25:17,707
Who are you trying to fool
with that badass stuff?

1027
01:25:17,912 --> 01:25:20,904
All that murder shit?
Totally September 10th, Jerome.

1028
01:25:29,524 --> 01:25:31,253
Jerome...

1029
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,352
Have you seen Jonah?

1030
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:37,159
No.

1031
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:40,201
Don't despair, okay?

1032
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:44,167
You call me over the break,
and we'll get you right back on track.

1033
01:25:44,372 --> 01:25:45,862
Okay?

1034
01:26:09,931 --> 01:26:11,228
Okay, you win.

1035
01:26:11,432 --> 01:26:13,366
It's all yours, so live it up.

1036
01:26:13,968 --> 01:26:15,663
- Jerome...
- You're the one out of 100...

1037
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:19,328
...that goes on to fame and fortune.
I'm just another deluded asshole.

1038
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:22,874
- These paintings...
- Fuck those paintings, and fuck you.

1039
01:26:23,077 --> 01:26:24,942
You have everybody fooled,
but not me.

1040
01:26:25,146 --> 01:26:28,775
You came up with a good gimmick,
your tough-guy, Joe Normal act...

1041
01:26:28,983 --> 01:26:32,646
...but your paintings are fucking
bullshit, and you know it.

1042
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:35,254
Well I still kicked your ass, didn't I?

1043
01:26:35,456 --> 01:26:38,050
Jonah, come on.
Where you been? We gotta go.

1044
01:26:38,259 --> 01:26:40,557
Jerome, wait here.
I wanna talk to you.

1045
01:26:40,762 --> 01:26:42,593
You have to meet your public.

1046
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:46,730
Marvelous work, Jonah.

1047
01:26:47,168 --> 01:26:49,329
Good job, Jonah.

1048
01:27:17,865 --> 01:27:19,799
Building burned up.

1049
01:27:20,335 --> 01:27:21,893
Everybody died.

1050
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:29,071
Some asshole didn't put out
his cigarette.

1051
01:27:35,116 --> 01:27:36,674
This is it.

1052
01:28:01,909 --> 01:28:04,673
What the fuck, Jonah.

1053
01:28:05,313 --> 01:28:07,645
Mikey, get your ass over here.

1054
01:28:07,849 --> 01:28:09,043
Where's Jonah?

1055
01:28:10,885 --> 01:28:12,079
So?

1056
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:14,778
What? This fucking nobody
is gonna stand me up?

1057
01:28:14,989 --> 01:28:16,786
I gave him the message,
Mr. D'Annunzio.

1058
01:28:24,232 --> 01:28:27,065
Hey, come on.
Bob hates people being late.

1059
01:28:27,268 --> 01:28:29,099
I really gotta find Jerome.

1060
01:28:32,273 --> 01:28:33,535
Come on.

1061
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:38,010
Don't shoot me, man! Don't shoot!

1062
01:28:56,898 --> 01:28:58,763
Police! Get down on the ground!

1063
01:28:59,367 --> 01:29:00,561
Face down!

1064
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:05,362
Cut! What are you doing,
asshole, you ruined my best take!

1065
01:29:06,741 --> 01:29:09,574
My arm...
I think my arm is broken.

1066
01:29:09,777 --> 01:29:12,473
Well, that's great!
What in fuck's name do I do now?

1067
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:14,208
Hey!

1068
01:29:14,415 --> 01:29:16,610
Where have you been?

1069
01:29:20,288 --> 01:29:21,516
What the hell is this?

1070
01:29:22,724 --> 01:29:24,783
What is this nonsense?

1071
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:28,621
Let's go, hotshot.
Chief wants you right now, come on.

1072
01:29:29,630 --> 01:29:33,066
What are you thinking, huh?
You paying attention to me?

1073
01:29:34,902 --> 01:29:36,699
God, I'm a fucking idiot.

1074
01:29:50,151 --> 01:29:52,085
Did you see a portrait of me?

1075
01:29:52,286 --> 01:29:53,753
A really beautiful...

1076
01:29:54,288 --> 01:29:55,915
It was right here.

1077
01:29:56,491 --> 01:29:58,220
I chucked everything out back.

1078
01:30:00,762 --> 01:30:03,424
Police! Open the door!
I got a warrant!

1079
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:08,962
Police! Don't try anything!

1080
01:30:10,571 --> 01:30:13,267
- Oh, Jesus.
- This isn't what you think.

1081
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:23,547
- Jerome Platz!
- Jerome Platz!

1082
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:25,514
Jerome Platz! You in there?

1083
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:27,551
- Jerome Platz!
- Hey, Jerome Platz!

1084
01:30:52,413 --> 01:30:55,041
Audrey, I know you
don't care about me...

1085
01:30:56,184 --> 01:30:57,811
...but maybe someday you'll...

1086
01:31:03,324 --> 01:31:07,658
Excuse me. Police business.
Clear the way, please. Excuse me.

1087
01:31:07,862 --> 01:31:09,420
Are we gonna have a problem?

1088
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:12,497
Excuse me, please. Excuse me.

1089
01:31:13,167 --> 01:31:15,465
Go draw something, will you?

1090
01:31:27,582 --> 01:31:30,107
Lonny, I'm sorry.

1091
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:32,786
I know I let personal things
get in the way of my job...

1092
01:31:32,987 --> 01:31:35,683
...but it'll never happen again.
- Superstar, we got him.

1093
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:38,950
- All's well that ends well, okay?
- Hey, Jonah.

1094
01:31:39,193 --> 01:31:40,785
You suck!!

1095
01:31:40,995 --> 01:31:42,257
Have a nice death, pig.

1096
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:43,691
You wanna spit at us again?

1097
01:31:43,931 --> 01:31:48,459
I will take you down so fast,
you got no idea, you fucking freak.

1098
01:31:48,703 --> 01:31:50,728
Mikey, let's clear it up
and get out of here.

1099
01:31:50,938 --> 01:31:54,430
- Kevin, you wanna ride with him?
- Let me do it, Lonny.

1100
01:31:57,345 --> 01:32:01,213
- Yeah, you fucking pig!
- Fucking pig!

1101
01:32:07,388 --> 01:32:09,720
Well, I knew there was something
weird about you.

1102
01:32:17,899 --> 01:32:20,094
What did you really think
about my?

1103
01:32:21,936 --> 01:32:24,336
Did you think my paintings
were any good at all?

1104
01:32:30,011 --> 01:32:33,208
- Yeah, maybe.
- I could have made it as an artist?

1105
01:32:34,849 --> 01:32:36,612
No, I don't know about that.

1106
01:32:40,855 --> 01:32:42,550
Hey.

1107
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:44,953
So are you really the guy?

1108
01:32:45,159 --> 01:32:48,595
Jerome, look over here!
Let me get a picture! Jerome!

1109
01:34:04,905 --> 01:34:07,499
Jerome. Visiting hours.

1110
01:34:11,212 --> 01:34:15,546
<i>Should we judge an artist</i>
<i>by what he does in his personal life?</i>

1111
01:34:16,917 --> 01:34:19,010
<i>If he's an anti-Semite,</i>
<i>like T.S. Eliot...</i>

1112
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:22,383
<i>... or a bully, like Picasso...</i>

1113
01:34:22,590 --> 01:34:24,820
<i>... or in this case, a murderer...</i>

1114
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:29,059
<i>... should his art</i>
<i>have any less value?</i>

1115
01:34:29,964 --> 01:34:31,329
<i>I think not.</i>

1116
01:34:31,532 --> 01:34:34,194
<i>Look, if I wanna have a showing</i>
<i>of this artist's work...</i>

1117
01:34:34,402 --> 01:34:36,097
<i>... nobody has any right to stop me.</i>

1118
01:34:36,303 --> 01:34:38,032
<i>I'm fighting</i>
<i>for First Amendment rights.</i>

1119
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:41,970
<i>You're with me or you're a fucking</i>
<i>Nazi, as far as I'm concerned.</i>

1120
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:44,337
<i>What? Why can't I say that?</i>

1121
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:48,681
<i>We didn't even know it was</i>
<i>a documentary at first, but then...</i>

1122
01:34:50,051 --> 01:34:53,487
<i>... you know, it just sort of</i>
<i>all came together.</i>

1123
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:57,920
<i>I mean, that's the way I like to work.</i>
<i>Finding my way as I go along.</i>

1124
01:34:58,125 --> 01:35:00,525
<i>No, I don't think I'd ever sell it.</i>

1125
01:35:00,728 --> 01:35:03,526
<i>Jerome was always so passionate</i>
<i>about his art.</i>

1126
01:35:05,066 --> 01:35:07,694
<i>It's really unfortunate</i>
<i>what happened...</i>

1127
01:35:07,902 --> 01:35:11,998
<i>... but, I mean, I always knew</i>
<i>he'd be a famous artist someday.</i>

1128
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:14,400
I just wanna do what's best
for my client.

1129
01:35:14,608 --> 01:35:16,838
Why don't you trust Jerome
to know what's best?

1130
01:35:17,044 --> 01:35:20,036
And what's best for Jerome
is to stay for as long as possible...

1131
01:35:20,247 --> 01:35:21,839
...followed by a lengthy trial.

1132
01:35:22,083 --> 01:35:24,278
I have more than enough evidence
to get him out.

1133
01:35:24,518 --> 01:35:29,012
- This case should not even go to trial.
- Where the fuck did they find you?

1134
01:35:29,223 --> 01:35:31,657
Jerome needs a lawyer
who understands what to do...

1135
01:35:31,859 --> 01:35:34,054
...when a situation like this
presents itself.

1136
01:35:34,295 --> 01:35:37,355
I am very close to the family.
I went to school with Hugh Platz.

1137
01:35:37,598 --> 01:35:39,190
That's real nice. Now, look...

1138
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:42,062
You know how many paintings
I can sell for your client...

1139
01:35:42,269 --> 01:35:43,896
...while this is going on?

1140
01:35:45,773 --> 01:35:48,173
Jerome. How's my boy?

1141
01:35:48,375 --> 01:35:51,139
- How's the work coming?
- It's fine.

1142
01:35:51,345 --> 01:35:53,939
Can't believe how many
people are calling about you.

1143
01:35:54,148 --> 01:35:56,514
- I had to cut off the waiting list.
- Great.

1144
01:35:57,718 --> 01:35:59,709
Jerome, I just wanna let you know...

1145
01:35:59,954 --> 01:36:03,151
...if you change your mind,
we can get you out of here.

1146
01:36:03,824 --> 01:36:07,624
I know, I know.
But we've been through all this.

1147
01:36:10,831 --> 01:36:12,389
Are these my only visitors?

1148
01:36:14,869 --> 01:36:18,464
Jerome, you get a chance
to call the guy from <i>Artforum</i>?

1149
01:36:18,706 --> 01:36:22,107
He wants to talk. Also, did you take
a moment to look at those papers?

1150
01:36:22,309 --> 01:36:24,038
I need you to sign the yellow one.

1151
01:36:25,179 --> 01:36:27,977
Keep your chin up, Jerome.
We all love you.

1152
01:36:28,215 --> 01:36:31,150
- All right.
- I'll call you tonight.

1153
01:36:48,068 --> 01:36:49,467
Hi.

1154
01:36:56,177 --> 01:36:57,474
Hey.

1155
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:10,955
- Can we go now?
- Cut.

1156
01:42:11,305 --> 01:42:17,397
Better than Tinder on 
DMhookup.com
