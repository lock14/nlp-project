00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,388
I Don't
Want To Go.

40
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,390
They're Trying
To Get Rid Of Us Before They Arrived.

41
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,591
A Few Of The Residents

42
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:06,593
Are Just Leaving
On A Day Excursion

43
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,394
But, Um, Come On Through
To The Sitting Room.

44
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:09,895
We'll Get You
Comfortable,

45
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,898
And I Can Explain
All About Life Here At Woodlane.

46
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,400
I'm Not Going.
I Am Not Going.

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,901
Actually, She's
Just Trying To Get Rid Of Us.

48
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,404
Heather, Hazel...
She's Just Trying To Get Rid Of Us.

49
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:19,405
Let Me Tell You
Something About This Bloody Place.

50
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,906
Are You
Looking Forward To Your Day Out?

51
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:24,410
No!
I'm Not Going, And You Can't Make Me.

52
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,411
We're Not
Going, Anyway.

53
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,412
If She's Not Going,
I'm Not Going.

54
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,414
Do Those Two Hags
Never Stop Whining?

55
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,416
Shall We All Come
Through To The Fire,

56
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,418
And Settle
Down, Yes?

57
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:33,419
By The Way,
Someone Went Into My Room

58
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,920
And Left The
Toilet Seat Up

59
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:35,922
While I Was
At Breakfast.

60
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,424
Hazel, Why Would Anyone
Do Anything Like That?

61
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,125
So That People
Would Think I Had Men In.

62
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,630
Men In Your Room.
That'll Be The Day.

63
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,634
Heather,
Wait For Me!

64
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,037
They Practically
Ran Out Of The Place.

65
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,539
Oh No! You'll Have To Advertise Again.

66
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,542
You Do Realise That
In The Last Six Months,

67
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,443
You've Lost Two Nurses,
Six Carers,

68
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,945
And Three Residents
Because Those Four Obnoxious Old...

69
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,447
Two Residents.

70
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,949
Mrs. Holland Died Of
A Massive Heart Attack.

71
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,651
Yeah, Well I'm Sure
They Caused It.

72
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:06,853
Look, As
Your Accountant,

73
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,654
I've Said It Before
And I'll Say It Again,

74
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,757
Get Rid Of Them.
Got To Call You Back.

75
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:11,758
What's All This?

76
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,760
Well How About,
"Hi, Ellie, How's It Going?"

77
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,661
You Should
Have Rung. What...

78
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,664
It Cost A Fortune
To Send You To College.

79
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,365
Now You Want To
Work As A Skivvy?

80
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,367
A Hygiene
Technician.

81
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,868
And It's
Temporary.

82
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:23,870
It Won't Work.

83
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,371
It Never Works.

84
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,872
I Haven't Seen
You For What...

85
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,975
A Year? And
After 10 Minutes,

86
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,076
I Don't Think I Want
To See You For Another Year.

87
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,577
Oh, Come On, Kate.

88
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,080
It Looks Like
You Could Do With Some Help.

89
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,082
I Heard The Staff
Are Leaving Here

90
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,084
Quicker Than
The Residents.

91
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,185
Mum Told Me.

92
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,586
So, You Two Are
Speaking Again, Then?

93
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,088
Well, Not Really.

94
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:46,592
I Ring Home, She Talks
About You, Or Herself.

95
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:47,794
Mostly About You.

96
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,096
I Don't Figure
Largely In The Conversations.

97
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,098
It Would Be Good
For Both Of Us.

98
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:55,000
Ellie, You're Not
Doing This For Me.

99
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,002
So What's
Really Going On?

100
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,406
Some Friends Are
Planning This Round The World Trip,

101
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,408
And I Really Want
To Go With Them, Kate.

102
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,209
How Many Times Are
You Going To Go Around The World?

103
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,212
Look, I Figured If You
Just Paid Me In Cash...

104
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,214
I Suppose You Want
To Live Here As Well?

105
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:09,715
Well, You've
Plenty Of Room.

106
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:13,219
I Gave Up My Flat
So I Wouldn't Have To Waste Money On Rent.

107
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,221
It's The Only Way
I'd Have Enough Money To Go With Them

108
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,623
And I'm Trying To Get
Dan To Go With Me, Too.

109
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,325
You're Not Still Going
Out With Him, Are You?

110
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,826
Two Years Now,
Thank You Very Much.

111
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,728
I Just Don't Know
What You See In Him.

112
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,731
He Always Seems So
Bloody Miserable.

113
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,033
Not When He's
With Me, He's Not.

114
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:30,536
So, What Do
You Say?

115
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:32,839
Why Can't I Stay
At Your House?

116
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,340
If You Want
To Work Here,

117
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,341
You Have To Stay In
Staff Accommodation.

118
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,348
Ugh... Jesus, It's
Freezing In Here!

119
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,855
You Don't Seriously
Expect Me To Wear This?

120
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,461
Mum Was Right.

121
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,463
His Eyes Are Too
Close Together.

122
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,964
She Said The Same
About David.

123
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,968
You May As Well
Start Straight Away.

124
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,870
Ten Minutes,
Downstairs.

125
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:05,872
Oh, And Ellie?

126
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,073
Do Something
With Your Hair!

127
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,178
Get Out Of My Home!

128
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,879
Get Out! Get Out!

129
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,083
You Come Into My Room,

130
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,086
You Move Everything,
And I Can't Find It.

131
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,987
And I Know You're
Stealing From Me.

132
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,991
Why Don't You
Go Back To Asia,

133
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:25,791
Where You Belong?

134
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:26,993
I Am Spanish,
Georgia.

135
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,996
Who Cares?

136
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:30,796
You're All The Same.

137
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,799
Do You Even Have
A Visa To Get Into This Country?

138
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,300
I Don't Need
A Visa To Work.

139
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,801
I Am European.

140
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,804
You're A What?

141
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,305
You're A...

142
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,507
You're A Pain
In The Ass!

143
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,309
I Can't Go Out
With One Earring.

144
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,812
Get Back In My Room
And Find My Earring!

145
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,314
But I Cannot
Find It.

146
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:49,815
Maybe Ellie
Could Find It?

147
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,044
Hello.

148
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,046
Hello.

149
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,549
Shame About
The Weather.

150
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,551
Yes, Isn't It?

151
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:32,058
I'd Like To Go Down
By The River.

152
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,061
But They Say
I'll Catch My Death.

153
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,266
What's So Funny?

154
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,271
I'm Dying Anyway.

155
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,273
A Little Trip
To The River

156
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,774
Won't Make
The Slightest Difference.

157
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,580
Never Think He
Was Once A Judge Of The High Court,

158
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,081
Would You?

159
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,584
Quite Brilliant In
His Day, Apparently.

160
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,390
You Don't Look
Like Someone

161
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,892
Who'd Work In
A Place Like This.

162
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:08,794
You Don't Look
Like Someone

163
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,296
Who'd Stay In
A Place Like This.

164
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,798
Well, I Never
Thought I'd End Up In One.

165
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,301
I'm Alice.

166
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,802
I'm Ellie.

167
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,805
It's Very Nice
To Meet You.

168
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,306
Well, Ellie, If
You Don't Mind,

169
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:23,809
I'd Like To Continue
Taking In The View.

170
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,014
I'll Clean Up
In Here Later.

171
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:38,724
What Is It?

172
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,225
I'm In The Middle
Of A Game Of Pool.

173
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,227
Would You Let
Hazel Know,

174
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,328
There's A Registered
Letter Here For Her?

175
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,829
How Many Times Have
I Got To Tell You

176
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,332
That Hazel Does Not
Want To Be Bothered

177
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,333
With Stuff Like This?

178
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,335
The Post
Goes To Me!

179
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,700
Ah, We're Awake, Are We?

180
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,003
Now, How Are
We Feeling Today?

181
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,505
No Need To Shout.

182
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,507
I May Be Dying,
But I'm Not Deaf.

183
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,013
Ellie? Uh,

184
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,516
You'd Stay And Give
Me My Breakfast, Don't You?

185
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:11,517
Of Course.

186
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,018
Well, Thank You,
Nurse.

187
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,825
Oh, Wow!

188
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:20,826
You Look Really
Beautiful.

189
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,327
Where Was This Taken?

190
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,830
Morocco.

191
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,331
A Long Time Ago.

192
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,235
I Remember Very Well,

193
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,839
Lying On A Beach
Outside Casablanca.

194
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,241
Smoking Hashish.

195
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,246
Not The Sort Of
Behaviour Expected

196
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,348
Of A Young Lady
In Those Days, Believe Me.

197
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,552
I Can Get You Some,
If You Like.

198
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,554
Well, At This Stage
I'd Try Anything.

199
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,359
We Were There
One Christmas...

200
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,362
It Was Just Right,
You Know?

201
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,865
Sunny And Warm.

202
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:03,869
A Holiday Relaxes A Man.

203
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,872
He Was Very Handsome.

204
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,375
He Was.

205
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,179
Unfortunately, We
Were Never Blessed With Children,

206
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,681
And I Regret That.

207
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,683
But We Travelled A Lot.

208
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:22,187
I've Led
A Charmed Life, Ellie.

209
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,790
Is He Still Alive?

210
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,995
Only In Here.

211
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,097
Oh, I'm Sorry.

212
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:31,897
Don't Be.

213
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,399
We Had A Great
Time Together.

214
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:38,404
And I'm Kind
Of Hoping...

215
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:42,408
That I'll See Him
Again Someday.

216
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,019
Hey?

217
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,522
Ellie, Waking
Everyone Up

218
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:57,623
In The Middle Of
The Night Is Not On.

219
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,125
Sorry!

220
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,527
Nurse Has Been
Complaining About You Again.

221
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,429
Said She Had To
Serve Breakfast By Herself This Morning.

222
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,731
Where Were You?

223
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,733
I Was With Alice,
She Needed To Talk.

224
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,735
I'm Not Paying You
To Sit Around Chatting.

225
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:11,036
Anything Else?

226
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,438
No.

227
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:15,941
God, You're
So Uptight All The Time. Jeez!

228
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,945
When Was The
Last Time You Took A Holiday?

229
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,947
All That Money You
Got When David Died.

230
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,949
What About It?

231
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:25,450
Why Don't You
Spend Some Of It?

232
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,453
How Do You Think
I Bought This Place?

233
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,459
Always Poking Your
Nose Into Things

234
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,460
That Don't Concern
You, Aren't You?

235
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,464
We're Going To
End Up Like Them If We're Not Careful.

236
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,969
Yeah.

237
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,470
They Spent
Their Whole Lives

238
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:46,472
Looking After
Their Invalid Mother.

239
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,973
And Then When
She Died,

240
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,975
They Didn't
Know What To Do With Themselves.

241
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,476
So They Moved
In Here?

242
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,478
Mm-Hmm.

243
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,085
I Never Faint

244
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,587
Because I'm Not
Sure That I Would Fall Gracefully

245
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,088
And I Never Use
Smelling Salts...

246
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,590
I Never Use Smelling Salts,

247
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,092
Because Zey
Puff Up Ze Eyes.

248
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,595
Yes? Yes?

249
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,096
I Found
Your Earring.

250
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,099
Oh, You Are An Angel.

251
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,112
Georgia Summers?

252
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,114
That Was
Your Stage Name.

253
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,014
Very Glamorous.

254
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,516
I Suppose "Platt"
Isn't Very...

255
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:34,019
Darling, Could You
Make Me A Martini?

256
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,021
That's What
I Need.

257
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,023
I Didn't Know You
Were Allowed Alcohol.

258
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,025
We're Not Prisoners.

259
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,526
We Actually Pay
To Be Here,

260
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,028
Bizarrely Enough.

261
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,530
75 Milli Of Gin,

262
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,733
Whisper Of Dry Vermouth.

263
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,234
Shake And Pour,

264
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,237
And Don't Forget
The Olive.

265
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,746
Are You Out
Of Your Mind?

266
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:01,546
What?

267
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:06,552
I Could Be
Arrested For This.

268
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,553
Would You Relax?

269
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,554
It's A Tiny Bit
Of Grass,

270
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:09,555
And It's For Alice.

271
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,557
Oh, Oh! It's
For Alice.

272
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,558
Oh, Silly Me.

273
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,059
Oh, That's
Okay, So...

274
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,560
What... What
Are You Doing?

275
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,063
You Do This Again
And You're Out, Do You Hear?

276
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,065
And If You've
Any More Drugs, Get Rid Of Them.

277
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,567
You Just Don't
Think, Do You?

278
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,570
You Know, If You
Want To Mess Up Your Own Life,

279
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,571
That's Fine.
Just Don't Try

280
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,572
And Drag Me
Down With You.

281
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,574
Yeah, You Don't Need
My Help For That.

282
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,576
Oh, You Always Have
The Smart Answer, Don't You?

283
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,077
It Helps Her
With Her Pain.

284
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:33,578
She's Dying, Kate.

285
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,080
I Was Trying
To Help Her.

286
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,082
You're Trying
To Get Me Closed Down, You Mean.

287
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:38,083
This Is
My Premises,

288
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,584
I'll Be Held
Responsible.

289
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,587
These Are Going
Down The Toilet.

290
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,088
Oh, You And
Your Fucking Rules!

291
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,302
Huh...

292
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:19,785
Yes.

293
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:30,796
Was That Absolutely
Necessary?

294
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,198
Oh, Tactics, My Darling,
As Our Donald Would Say.

295
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:34,199
Tactics.

296
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:39,104
Mammy Always Said You
Were Too Competitive.

297
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,414
Oops-A-Daisy.

298
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:57,822
Who's Having Tea?

299
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,225
Two Shots To Me.

300
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:03,228
Oh No, Ellie! You
Totally Distracted Me.

301
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:04,229
I Was Just About
To Pot The Ball.

302
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,731
Did You Not Think...
God Almighty!

303
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,233
What Are You
Laughing At?

304
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,034
You Stupid
Woman! God!

305
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,241
Jesus Christ, What's
Happened To You?

306
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:16,741
Jesus, Mary
And Joseph.

307
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:19,244
Hazel, Let Me
See Your Eyes!

308
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,246
Please! Please,
Let Me See If You're Blinded!

309
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,747
Oh, Thank God!

310
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:23,548
There's No
Blood, Darling.

311
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:32,558
What Were You Thinking?

312
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:33,559
It Was An Accident.

313
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,060
Look, I Wasn't Even
Aiming For Hazel,

314
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,161
I Was Aiming
For Heather.

315
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,662
Well, I
Warned You.

316
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,164
So You Can
Pack Your Bags And Leave.

317
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,665
Oh, Come On, Kate.

318
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,167
Look, What Am
I Supposed To Do When I'm Attacked?

319
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,468
Attacked?

320
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,970
By A Woman Twice Your Age
In A Residential Home?

321
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,972
You Let Them Get
Away With Murder.

322
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:48,473
I've A Business To Run.

323
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,375
Yeah. Well, If You
Ask Me, You're Running It Into The Ground.

324
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,877
Well, I Didn't
Ask You,

325
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,379
And You're Not
Making My Life Any Easier.

326
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,181
I Have A Department
Of Health Inspector

327
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,682
Due Here Soon.

328
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,184
It'll Be Just Great
If Hazel Tells Them

329
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,185
What Happened
To Her Eye.

330
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,586
Staff Attacking
Residents?

331
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:02,588
It Was Hardly An Attack.

332
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:05,190
She Didn't Even Need
That Fucking Eye Patch.

333
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,191
I Don't Need
Any More Trouble.

334
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,695
So...

335
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,701
Where Will
You Go?

336
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,802
Look, I'm
Really Sorry.

337
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,303
I Didn't Mean It.

338
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:22,007
Would You Give Me One
More Chance, Please?

339
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:24,410
Please.

340
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,917
Go On. Get It.
Get The Remote Control.

341
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:32,918
He's Asleep.

342
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,329
You'll Be Able
To Munch Through Acres Of Grass

343
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,331
With Those New
Gnashers, Mary.

344
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,540
That Was
A Horrible Thing To Say.

345
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,341
Horrible, But True!

346
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:57,842
Bloody Dentist!

347
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:01,346
I'd Like To Gnash
His Gnashers.

348
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,447
I'll Have Tea.

349
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:03,449
A Little Milk,
No Sugar.

350
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,450
Get It Yourself.

351
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:10,055
I Said, No Sugar
And A Little Milk.

352
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:33,438
God. Jeez.

353
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:34,439
What Are You
Doing In Here?

354
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,941
Your Nerves Are
In A Bad Way.

355
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,443
You Shouldn't
Be In Here,

356
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,445
And You Certainly
Shouldn't Be Smoking.

357
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:46,451
Your Concern
For My Health Is So Touching.

358
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,556
Hot Date, Have We?

359
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:53,458
I Suppose
"Honk-Honk"

360
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,960
Is Zooming Up
Late As Usual.

361
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,462
We're Supposed To
Keep Them Waiting,

362
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:58,963
Not The Other
Way 'round.

363
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,470
Honk-Honk.

364
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,585
Hello! Dan?

365
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,087
Can You Hear Me?

366
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:23,088
Shit!

367
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,601
Do You Want To Come In?

368
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,006
Shit...

369
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,508
Is He Always Late?

370
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,710
He's Just Been Working
Really Hard Lately.

371
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:58,724
He's Not
Coming, Is He?

372
00:20:58,724 --> 00:20:59,725
No, He's Busy.

373
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,729
Well, Do You Want
To See A Film?

374
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:04,730
We Could Get
A Pizza...

375
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,731
No, I Don't.

376
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,232
It's Saturday Night,
I Want To Go Out.

377
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,733
Look, Why
Don't We Go?

378
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,235
Are You Mad?

379
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,237
Kate, It's Been
Five Years Now Since David Died.

380
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,738
How Do You Expect
To Meet Anyone

381
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:14,740
If You Don't
Get Out There?

382
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,443
When Did Donald's Wife Die?

383
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:22,747
Um... Couple
Of Years Ago.

384
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,249
I Bet He Never
Acted The Arsehole

385
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:25,750
When She Was Around.

386
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,352
Why?

387
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:28,853
I Was Just Wondering.

388
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,355
It's Funny How
Differently

389
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:31,856
People Respond To Loss.

390
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,360
What Did She Die Of?

391
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,862
Cancer.
Same As David.

392
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,365
He Doesn't Like
To Talk About It.

393
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,367
I Wonder
What's Worse...

394
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:45,870
Dying, Or Being
The One Watching,

395
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:46,872
Not Being Able
To Do Anything.

396
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:49,474
Either Way,
It's Shite, Ellie.

397
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,576
Fuck It. I'm Going To
Go And Surprise Him.

398
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,178
Some Men Don't Like
To Be Surprised.

399
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,780
He's Not Like That.
He'll Love It!

400
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,285
Close The Bloody Door.

401
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,536
As You Know, The Department
Needs To Ensure

402
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,537
Regulations Are Met.

403
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,038
Yes, I'll See What I Can Get Done

404
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,541
With That Application
In The Meantime.

405
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,043
And, Uh, I Need It
On My Desk A.S.A.P.

406
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,547
Yes, Thank You
Very Much, Mr. Evans.

407
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,555
Elle, Are You
All Right?

408
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,556
You Look A Bit...

409
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,557
Yeah, I'm Fine.

410
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,559
How Was Dan?

411
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,560
Great.

412
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,061
So, He Didn't Mind
Being Surprised, Then?

413
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,564
No. Why
Should He?

414
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,565
Who Was That?

415
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,567
Mmm. Department
Of Health.

416
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,569
Mr. Evans.

417
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,572
He Likes Dropping
In Unannounced Every So Often,

418
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,575
To See If He'll
Catch Us Torturing The Residents.

419
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,077
Oh! Look,
Missed A Bit.

420
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,486
Hi, Alice.

421
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:43,488
I Have Something
For You.

422
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,302
What's Wrong, Ellie?

423
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,304
You Look Tired.

424
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,814
Take Me Down To The River.

425
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,816
The Nurse'll Have A Fit.

426
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:11,817
Screw Nurse.

427
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,220
Quick! Quick! Yes!

428
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:17,722
Shh, Shh...

429
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:19,384
Ellie, Just Because
You Split Up With Your Boyfriend

430
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:21,085
Doesn't Mean
You Can't Go.

431
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,087
Don't Be One
Of Those Women

432
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,589
Who Thinks They
Can Only Do Things

433
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,591
If They Have A Man
At Their Side.

434
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:30,094
What Does
Your Sister Say?

435
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,596
I Didn't Tell Her.

436
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:32,897
She'd Just Say,
"I Told You So".

437
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,900
Oh, Ellie.
You Need To Pay More Attention

438
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,901
To What People Do.

439
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,802
Not To What
They Say,

440
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:38,803
Or How They Seem.

441
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:39,804
It's What They Do

442
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:42,006
That Tells You
About Them.

443
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,509
She Gave You
A Job, Didn't She?

444
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,010
And A Place
To Live.

445
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:48,012
Ugh.

446
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:06,330
Maybe I Should Have
Thought Of This Earlier.

447
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:10,335
Or Maybe It's
Just As Well.

448
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,844
You Only See
Things Properly

449
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:22,847
When You're
About To Leave.

450
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:23,848
Then It's As
If You're Seeing

451
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,349
For The First Time.

452
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,854
Everything
Seems To Shine!

453
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:22,707
Open A Window And
Let Some Air In.

454
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:13,157
Bye-Bye. Merry Christmas.

455
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,160
See You At New Year!
Merry Christmas!

456
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:56,300
Would You Like Some Tea,
Or Some Cookies?

457
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:58,202
I Thought You Said "Cocaine".

458
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,205
Do All The
Residents Leave?

459
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,208
A Few Will Stay,
The Horrible Ones.

460
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:06,211
And Poor Kate,
She Stay Here To Mind Them.

461
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,713
I Would Rather
Spend Christmas

462
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:10,214
With The Devil
Than With Them.

463
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,716
How About You?

464
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:12,717
Um...

465
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:14,719
No, I've Got
To Leave.

466
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:15,720
I'll Stay With
Some Friends

467
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,222
For A Few Days,
And Then...

468
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:19,724
Who Knows?

469
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:21,225
How About You?

470
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,728
Uh, I Go Back To
Spain, To My Family.

471
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,463
Goodbye.

472
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,976
You Still Play?

473
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,680
Um, Yeah,
Sometimes.

474
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,182
I Haven't
Played For Ages.

475
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,186
Ellie, Mum's
Had A Stroke.

476
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,687
She's In
Hospital.

477
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:23,688
Is She Okay?

478
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:24,889
Yeah, She's Fine,
She's Stable.

479
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:25,890
Why Didn't You Tell Me?

480
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,591
I Only Found Out
A While Ago.

481
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:28,893
Look, I've Spent
The Last Hour

482
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:30,394
Trying To Relocate
Donald And Georgia

483
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,897
And The Nightingales
Into Santa Rosa.

484
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:34,098
All The Other Homes
Are Either Full

485
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:35,599
Or Closed For Christmas.

486
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,603
And, Frankly Even If
I Do Find Somewhere

487
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:39,604
For Donald And
The Nightingales,

488
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,606
No One'll Take Georgia.

489
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,608
She's Actually Barred
From Santa Rosa.

490
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,810
Did You Know That?

491
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:46,811
Why Can't They Stay Here

492
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:48,512
And Nurse Healy
Look After Them?

493
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,515
I Can't Ask Her.

494
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,016
She's Going
On A Cruise.

495
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,018
I've Never Seen
Her So Excited.

496
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,825
You'll Have
To Stay And Mind Them.

497
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,526
Me?

498
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,728
Look After Them?

499
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:05,329
Look, We've
No Choice.

500
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,331
You Know You Don't
Get On With Mum.

501
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:07,332
There's No Point
In You Going.

502
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:08,333
Look, Let Me Go.

503
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,334
I Won't Say
Anything To Upset Her.

504
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,336
You Don't Have
To Say Anything.

505
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:12,337
Look, I Really
Need This, Ellie.

506
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:13,838
It's The Only
Way It'll Work.

507
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:17,041
Keep An Eye On Georgia,
She's Manic-Depressive.

508
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,043
Keep Her Away
From The River.

509
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,545
I'm Always Afraid
She'll Fall In And Drown, Or Jump.

510
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,947
Afraid Or Hoping?

511
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:24,248
Very Funny.

512
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:25,250
Um...

513
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,352
Keep This On You
At All Times

514
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,853
In Case I Need
To Contact You.

515
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,154
All Right?

516
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:34,558
God, Ellie,
This Is Insane!

517
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,160
I Could Be Shut
Down For This.

518
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,661
If That Little Shit,
Mr. Evans,

519
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:38,663
Comes Snooping Around...

520
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:39,864
We've Just Had
An Inspection.

521
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:40,564
He Won't Be Back
For Months.

522
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,567
That's Not How
Mr. Evans Works.

523
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,268
Anyway...

524
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,271
I'll Send A Temp
As Fast As I Can.

525
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,272
Worst Case Scenario,

526
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:49,274
The Staff Will Be
Back On The 28Th.

527
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,475
That's A Week Away.

528
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:51,976
I Said, "Worst Case".

529
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,477
I Just Can't
Afford To Lose

530
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:54,979
Any More
Residents, Ellie.

531
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:57,081
You Really
Need To Be... Look, I'll Be Nice To Them,

532
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,082
Look, I Promise.

533
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,083
Will You Call Me
When You Get There?

534
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,584
All Right, Okay.

535
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,596
Hi.

536
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,598
Hi. Here You Go.

537
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,600
And A Miss Nightingale,
Hazel?

538
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,601
Yeah.

539
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,102
Sign There, Please.

540
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:29,514
No, I Had A Very,
Very Bad Experience

541
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:30,915
With Mushrooms.

542
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,917
Now, Miss Harris
Knows That.

543
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:35,019
Where Is She?

544
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,126
Our Mother
Isn't Very Well.

545
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,628
So, Kate Has Gone
To Look After Her.

546
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,131
Well, If Miss Harris
Is Not Here, Who Is?

547
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,632
Well, Only Me,
I'm Afraid.

548
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,634
I Think She Means:

549
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,736
"Anyone Of Any
Consequence".

550
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:53,237
Well, How Long Is
Miss Harris Going To Be Away For?

551
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,239
Well, It Could Be
Until After Christmas

552
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:57,040
Now, I Don't Know.

553
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,943
Oh, No This Is Not
Good Enough. No.

554
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:01,745
We Pay Good Money
To Be Here

555
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,748
And We Don't Need
To Put Up With This.

556
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:08,252
Well, Where Would You
Two Raconteurs Go To?

557
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:10,654
That Is, If You Can
Get Your Sister

558
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,657
To Go Out Of
The Front Door.

559
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,160
Santa Della Maria
Della Rosa, Actually.

560
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,162
Oh, Please, Go!

561
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,164
And Regale Them
All With Stories

562
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,666
Of Your Fabulous Love
Lives And Your Careers.

563
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,070
Santa Rosa Della Maria

564
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:29,073
Is Closed For
Christmas Now. And...

565
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:31,075
Georgia Is Banned
From Santa Rosa, Anyway,

566
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,077
So She Can't
Go Anywhere.

567
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:35,979
So, It Looks Like
We're Just Stuck With Each Other.

568
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,982
It Seems The
Only Way To Leave Here Is In A Box.

569
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:42,887
What About Me Soup?

570
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:44,889
You Can Have Chicken Noodle,

571
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:45,789
Classic Vegetable,

572
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,291
Carrot And
Coriander Soup,

573
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,292
Potato And Leek Soup,

574
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:49,793
Pea Soup, If You Like.

575
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:50,795
You Could Have
Mutton Broth,

576
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:52,296
Or You Can Have
Lobster Bisque.

577
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:53,297
Oxtail Soup,
Mmm!

578
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,298
Or You Can Have
French Onion Soup.

579
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:55,299
It All Comes
Out Of A Tin,

580
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,301
So It Makes No
Difference To Me.

581
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:58,302
What Would You Like?

582
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:32,036
Georgia? Hello?

583
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,537
I Expect You've Got An Ailment

584
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:36,040
And I've Got The Cure.

585
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,542
We'll Beat The Loath
From Your Body

586
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,044
And Every Morning You
Come Here To Work...

587
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:42,547
Georgia, What's Wrong?

588
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:43,447
There's A Bluebottle
Buzzing.

589
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,049
What?
A Bluebottle, Buzzing!

590
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:46,550
Can't You Hear It?

591
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,553
Th-That's The Fridge.

592
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:52,556
The Fridge.

593
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,060
As You're Here...

594
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,562
Might As Well
Get Me A Martini.

595
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:01,065
Two Measures Of Gin.

596
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:03,067
Four Measures
Of Vermouth.

597
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:04,568
Lot Of Ice. Shake It.

598
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:06,571
And Get Me Some Olives,
I've Run Out.

599
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,072
The House Phone
Is For Emergencies,

600
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:09,573
Not Bloody
Room Service.

601
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:11,075
You Bloody Well
Watch Your Language

602
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,576
Or I'll Bloody Well
Get You Sacked.

603
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:16,380
Ellie!

604
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,383
Ellie! Ellie!

605
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:21,886
Ellie!

606
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,992
Georgia:
Ah, Now...

607
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:30,995
Two Jigs Of Gin,

608
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:33,697
Four Jigs Of
Dry Vermouth.

609
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:36,200
Plenty Of Ice.

610
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,201
Shake It Well.

611
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:39,603
Thank You, Dear.

612
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:41,305
That's So Sweet Of You.

613
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,016
Donald, You Okay?

614
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,517
One Soft-Boiled Egg,

615
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:56,020
Two Slices Of Toast
With Butter And Tea

616
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,521
And Marmalade On The Side.

617
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,524
Donald, It's 5:30
In The Morning.

618
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:02,527
I'm Well Aware
Of The Time.

619
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,028
Breakfast Is At 8:00.

620
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:05,529
I Have It In My Room,

621
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,032
Every Day At
6:00 O'clock Sharp.

622
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:23,447
I Like My Toast
Cut Into Soldiers.

623
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,355
You'd Never
Think She Had Two Hip Replacements.

624
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,357
Didn't Have Two
Hip Replacements.

625
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,658
She Had One
Hip Replacement

626
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,160
And Then She
Broke Her Leg.

627
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,162
Tsk. At Her Age

628
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:39,963
You'd Think She'd
Be More Careful.

629
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,465
Especially
On Wet Grass.

630
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:42,966
She'd Do Anything
For Attention.

631
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,671
<i>I Love To Window Shop</i>

632
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:50,474
<i>On Fifth Avenue</i>

633
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:51,475
<i>I Like Banana Splits</i>

634
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:52,976
<i>Late Supper
At The Ritz</i>

635
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:54,979
<i>How About You?</i>

636
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:56,981
Whee!

637
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:58,482
Here, You Must
Be Freezing.

638
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:04,988
Whoop!

639
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,795
I Remember Feeling
Like That Once.

640
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:13,797
But I Was On Drugs.

641
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:19,603
Mozart!

642
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:20,605
Strauss!

643
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:21,606
Mozart!

644
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,608
Strauss!

645
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:26,110
Mozart Wrote
"Die Fledermaus".

646
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,611
What Mouse?

647
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,614
"Die Fledermaus"
By Mozart.

648
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,415
Strauss!
Mozart! Strauss!

649
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,916
Sorry?
"Die Fledermaus",

650
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,318
It's An Opera
By Strauss.

651
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:35,319
Hah!

652
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:36,320
I Don't Know
Anything About Opera.

653
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,322
Well, Neither Do
These Two Bats,

654
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,023
But It Doesn't
Stop Them Talking About It.

655
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,027
Bats!

656
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:46,030
"Die Fledermaus"!

657
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,332
No, Georgia, I
Don't Have Time To Get Your Olives.

658
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:50,834
Oh, You Stupid Girl, Stupid...

659
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,840
Oh, Shit!

660
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:06,850
God, Not Even When I'm 90.

661
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:22,366
Huh.

662
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:36,080
What The Hell Are
You Doing Here?

663
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,581
I'm... I'm So...

664
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:38,582
You Have No Right
To Be In Here.

665
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:39,883
Okay, I'm Sorry...
No Right Whatsoever!

666
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,285
Get Out!

667
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:58,802
Run! Run! Run!

668
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,304
Yes, Yes, Yes.

669
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:04,809
How Could You?

670
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,211
What Are You
Talking About?

671
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,712
He's Been Trying
To Find Me,

672
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:10,815
And You Knew.

673
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,817
Turn That
Fucking Thing Off!

674
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,819
What's The
Matter With You?

675
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:16,821
This. This
Is The Matter.

676
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:17,822
"Dear Miss
Nightingale,

677
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,824
Thank You For
Your Letter.

678
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:23,227
We Passed It On
To Simon As You Instructed.

679
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:24,228
He's Very
Disappointed

680
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:25,729
That You Don't
Want To Meet Him

681
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,331
But He Understands."

682
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:28,832
Oh, Come On, Hazel.

683
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,635
You Wrote,
Pretending You Were Me.

684
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:34,137
My Son Has Been
Trying To Find Me

685
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:35,839
And You Weren't
Going To Tell Me.

686
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,841
Well, I Just
Didn't Think

687
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:38,342
It Was Worth
Dragging All This Stuff Up...

688
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:40,143
How Long Have You
Known About This?

689
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:41,145
Well...

690
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,147
You Didn't Think
I'd Want To Meet My Son?

691
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,351
I Always Said
That If He Ever Looked For Me,

692
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:48,852
I Would Welcome Him
With Open Arms,

693
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:49,854
And You Knew That.

694
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:51,856
He's My Son,
For God's Sake.

695
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,958
He's Not
Your Son, Hazel.

696
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:57,661
You Gave Him Up
35 Years Ago.

697
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:59,663
But I Didn't Give
Him Up, Did I?

698
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,666
He Was Taken
From Me.

699
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:05,168
He Was Taken
From Me, Heather.

700
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:06,170
Because That
Father Of Ours

701
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,672
Was More Concerned About
What People Would Think

702
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:10,674
Than He Was For Me.

703
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:12,676
Ah, Daddy Was Only
Trying To Do The Best For You, Hazel,

704
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:13,877
And For The Family.

705
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:17,882
He Ruined My
Life And Yours And Mammy's.

706
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:19,884
No Wonder
She Got Sick.

707
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,385
And We Sat There

708
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:23,787
Like Fools And Took It.

709
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:27,291
You Have No Idea.

710
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,293
You Have No Idea
At All...

711
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:30,794
What It's Like To
Have A Part Of You

712
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,296
Taken Away Like That.

713
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:36,300
Not A Day Passes
That I Don't Think Of Him.

714
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,802
Not A Day Goes By
When I Don't Worry

715
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,304
About What
Happened To Him.

716
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:42,306
I Have Never Stopped
Thinking Of Him,

717
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:43,307
And Wondering...

718
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:51,415
And I Didn't Even
Know His Name.

Yeah.

725
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:29,753
Thought You
Wouldn't.

726
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:31,254
"Die Fledermaus",
Act One.

727
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:34,258
Will You Ever Go And
Fuck Yourself, Donald?

728
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:40,364
Now, Hazel Won't
Be Down For Her Food Tonight.

729
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:41,365
She's Not
Feeling The Best.

730
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:42,866
Oh, Something
Fatal, I Hope?

731
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:45,369
And Did Miss Harris
Not Tell You

732
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,871
That You Never,
Ever, Give The Post To Hazel?

733
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:48,873
You Give It
To Me.

734
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:49,874
You've Upset Her.

735
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:50,574
Okay, I'm Sorry...

736
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:52,075
Oh, You've Upset Her.

737
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:57,080
Oh, Very Parsimonious
With The Vegetables, Aren't We, Eleanor?

738
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:58,582
Have Either Of You
Seen Georgia Anywhere?

739
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:00,784
I Said, "Very
Parsimonious With The Vegeta..."

740
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:01,785
I Heard You.

741
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:15,900
Ugh...

742
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:29,913
Oops.

743
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:32,416
You... You Bastard!

744
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:33,917
Oh! Ooh.

745
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:42,926
Georgia's Missing.

746
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:44,328
Thank God For That.

747
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:45,829
Look, I-I Want
My Dessert

748
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,130
And I'd Like It Now.

749
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,133
Preferably
On My Plate,

750
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:51,034
Not On My Lap, If It's
Not Too Much To Ask.

751
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:55,439
She's Not Too Good

752
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:56,440

Oh, Oh.

753
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,341
She Said To Add It
To Her Bill.

754
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:01,444

That'll Be The Police.

755
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:04,949

756
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,450

Fine. Um...

760
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:11,955
Look, I'm... I'm Just
In The Middle Of Something Right Now.

761
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:12,957

Back Later?

762
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:14,959
Ellie, Tell Me Now!

807

808
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,449
I Passed
Three Auditions

809
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,451
And I Got Into
The Chorus

810
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,753
Of The Kit Kat Klub
In "Cabaret".

811
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:32,756
Oh, No. I've
Told You That.

812
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:35,258
And Before That, I Was
In "The Sound Of Music".

813
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:37,160
Or, Did I Tell You That?

814
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:40,164
No. No, You Didn't.

815
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:41,665

Long Ago.

816
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,669

You Were Born.

Nuthouse With A Bloody Stick.

821
00:46:57,681 --> 00:46:59,182

Good, Though.

822
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:00,684

00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:03,187
Oh, No, Sorry,
I Didn't Mean...

825
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:04,688
I Know What You Meant.

826
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,792
You See, Everything
Was Different.

827
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:10,293
Me And My Friends,

828
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:12,296
We All Wanted
To Look Like Twiggy.

829
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:13,797
"Look Like Twiggy".

830
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,801
None Of These
Goldfish Lips

831
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:19,302
And Balloon Boobs.

832
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:22,305
I Hated Living Alone.

833
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:24,308
That's Why I
Ended Up Here.

834
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,812
But All You Do
Is Abuse Everybody.

835
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:32,816
Guess That's
Part Of The Fun.

836
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:38,322
So, Why Here,
Georgia?

837
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:40,924
Well, My Husband
Was Irish, So We Lived Here.

838
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:42,926
We Had A Lot
Of Laughs.

839
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:45,428
Very Happy,
And Then He Went And Died On Me.

840
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:47,431
So, I Got The Stupid Idea

841
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:48,932
I'd Go Back
Into The Theatre.

842
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:50,433
Everything
Was Changed.

843
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:52,436
All The People I Knew
Had Either Died

844
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:54,438
Or...

845
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:57,941
Or Just
Didn't Care.

846
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:00,944
Mmm.

847
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:04,448
I Felt Like A Ghost.

848
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:07,451
Wandering Around.

849
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,953
No Connections Here.

850
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:12,956
Nothing To Go
Back To.

851
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:19,463
Ah...

852
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:24,467
Oh, Dear...

853
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:26,470
Don't Forget
The Olives.

854
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:43,546
I Know. One
Soft-Boiled Egg,

855
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:46,249
Two Pieces Of Toast,
Butter And Tea

856
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:48,751
And Marmalade
On The Side.

857
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:56,059

Piece Of Music

858
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:57,560

Last Night?

859
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,065
You Forgot The Salt.

860
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:03,566
Donald, Would You
Give Me A Break?

861
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,569
Look, I Can't Eat
My Egg Without Salt.

862
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:06,570
Right!

863
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,071

Salt As You Like

864
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:09,572

At 8:00 O'clock With The Others.

865
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:10,574
Now, Wait
A Minute.

866
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:11,775
Eleanor!

867
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:14,277
Well, I Was Thinking
Of Burning The Place Down,

868
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:15,278
With Them In It.

869
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:16,779

All Your Problems.

870
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,281
You Are Insured,
Aren't You?

871
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:19,782
Don't Even Joke About It.

872
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:21,284
Listen, Ellie...

873
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:24,787
I Don't Think I'm Going
To Get Home For Christmas.

874
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:26,790

Christmas Dinner Together.

894
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:31,955
Look, We're All
Going To Be Here For Christmas,

895
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:33,456
And There's Nothing
We Can Do About It,

896
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:35,659
So, We Might As Well
Try And Be A Family.

897
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:37,861
We May Be
A Dysfunctional Family,

898
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:39,762
But We're Still
A Family, Nonetheless.

899
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,664
I'd Rather Be Dead Than
Related To Any Of Them.

900
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:44,367
So, Is That
The Announcement?

901
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:46,969
I'm Going To Have
My Christmas Lunch In My Room.

902
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,571
Please Make
Sure It's Hot.

903
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:49,573
I'll Have Mine
In My Room,

904
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:50,574
You Can Leave It
Outside My Door.

905
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,077
I'm Not Going To
Take Any More Shit From Any Of You.

906
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:57,280
If You Want Your Lunch,
You Can Eat It Down Here, Or Else Starve.

907
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,281
Is There A Full
Moon Or Something?

908
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,782
Oh, Look At You.

909
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,785
You've Made A Mess
Of Your Whole Life.

910
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,387
And Here You Are,
Old, Bitter And Hateful.

911
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:06,789
And All You Do,
All Day, Is Sit Around,

912
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,892
Bitching And Moaning
And Complaining.

913
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:10,393
Wash This!
Bring Me That!

914
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:11,594
I Don't Eat This!
I Don't Eat That!

915
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:13,496
Bees Buzzing Around,
And Olives,

916
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:14,598
And Your Fucking Post.

917
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:16,099
Yeah, And You.

918
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:17,900
You're Probably Going To
End Up Leaving In A Box,

919
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:19,702
And The Sooner
The Better, As Far As I'm Concerned.

920
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:21,204
Look, I Can Be A
Spoiled Bitch Too.

921
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:26,009
Well, Come On! Let's
Smash The Place Up.

922
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:27,010
It's Going To Close Anyway.

923
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,312
C-Control
Yourself, Girl.

924
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,313
Why Should I?

925
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,314
You Bloody Don't.

926
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,014
I...

927
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:33,416
Just Because
You Pay To Be Here,

928
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:35,217
Doesn't Give You
The Right To Treat Me Like Shit!

929
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:37,220
Do You Know Between
The Four Of You,

930
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,621
You've Almost
Bankrupted Woodlane?

931
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:39,823
Nonsense!
Just Think About All The People

932
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,324
That Have Moved Out
Because Of You.

933
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,326
All The Empty
Rooms Upstairs.

934
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,328
How The Hell
Do You Think Kate Pays The Bills?

935
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,529
Don't Be Ridiculous.

936
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:47,531
W-W-Woodlane
Can't Close Down.

937
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:49,032
Yes, Heather, It Can.

938
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:50,533
And By The Way
That You Behave,

939
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:52,235
Nobody's Going To
Take You In For Long.

940
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:54,737
You'll End Up
Out On The Street

941
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:57,140
Or In A Mental
Institution With Mad People Screaming

942
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:59,342
And The Smell Of
Piss Everywhere.

943
00:53:00,544 --> 00:53:02,045
And As For You Two,

944
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:03,546
You Don't Even
Need To Be Here.

945
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:05,048
You're Not Even
Fucking Old.

946
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:06,349
You've Checked
Out Of Life

947
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:07,249
And You've
Checked Into Here.

948
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,150
All Of You!

949
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:55,298
Hazel...

950
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:56,799
Let Me In?

951
00:53:57,801 --> 00:53:59,803
Go Away!

952
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:13,116
Thanks.

953
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:27,130
Uh, "Gnossienne
Number 4" By Erik Satie.

954
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:30,633
I Used To
Play It...

955
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:33,136
For My Wife.

956
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:35,638
The Lady In
The Picture?

957
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:37,641
She Was Very
Beautiful.

958
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:42,645
It Was Sarah's
Favourite Piece.

959
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:47,150
And When I Play It,

960
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:48,151
I Feel Very
Close To Her.

961
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:55,658
One Moment,
She Was There.

962
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:01,664
Next Minute,
She Had Gone.

963
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:07,170
It Just Didn't
Make Sense.

964
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:12,575
Might Have Been Easier To Accept If...

965
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:15,077
I'd Managed To Sober
Up Before She Died.

966
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:20,082
I Mean, That Was
The Very Least

967
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:22,085
I Could Have
Done For Her.

968
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,591
But I Didn't.

969
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:35,098
I Wish I Had.

970
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,604
The Committee...

971
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:22,504
The Committee Said
That We Might Be Able To Help You.

972
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:25,608
Can You Let Her Finish
Just One Sentence?

973
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,109
Just Once.

974
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,811
Who Asked You,
Has-Been?

975
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:30,814
Well, At Least I Was Something.

976
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:32,816
What Did You Ever Do?

977
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:34,717
Nothing. You're Useless.

978
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:36,618
Like Tits On A Bull.

979
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:39,822
Ugh!

980
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:40,323
Donald!

981
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:44,126
The Committee Decided
We Might Help

982
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,828
Make Christmas
Dinner Tomorrow.

983
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:49,032
And We Made A List
Of What We Need.

984
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:51,034
We Should All Go
And Do The Shopping.

985
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:52,535
Oh, Shopping!
That's A Good Idea.

986
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:55,838
I'll Stay Here And...
No, Hazel...

987
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:56,940
Mind The House.

988
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,441
No, Please. I Don't Want You
To Be On Your Own.

989
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:00,643
I Don't Want To Go.

990
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:01,644
Look, We All Go
Or Nobody Goes.

991
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:07,049
Merry Christmas To You.

992
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:11,053
Merry Christmas To You.

993
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:15,558
Merry Christmas To You...

994
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,561
I Told You,
I'm Not Going.

995
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:19,962
She's Afraid
To Go Out.

996
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:21,464
But I See Her In
The Gardens All The Time.

997
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:22,965
But Not Out-Out.

998
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:24,467
Well, Tough.
You're Going.

999
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:25,468
Come On,
We Can Have A Little Talk.

1000
00:58:25,468 --> 00:58:26,469
I Don't Want
A Little Talk.

1001
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:29,472
All Right.
All Right.

1002
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:30,973
I Hate Going Out.

1003
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:32,475
I'll Be Out In
The Garden If You Change Your Mind.

1004
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:54,297
<i>The World In Sin And Error Pining</i>

1005
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:56,299
<i>Till He Appeared</i>

1006
00:58:56,299 --> 00:59:00,903
<i>And The Soul
Felt His Worth</i>

1007
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:06,910
<i>A Thrill Of Hope,
The Weary World Rejoices</i>

1008
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:08,411
We'll Take
That One.

1009
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:09,412
What?

1010
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:12,314
Donald's Getting
The Vegetables.

1011
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:15,017
Um, What Else
Do We Need?

1012
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:17,020
Ham.

1013
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,021
We Have The Ham.

1014
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:20,023
We Have
The Sprouts...

1015
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:22,025
Wh... Where's
Georgia?

1016
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:26,529
Oh, Okay, Um, Look...
Here, Take This.

1017
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:28,531
Take This. You're
Going To Have To Finish The Shopping.

1018
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:29,532
Just...

1019
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:31,534
Look, Um, Uh,
Look, Okay...

1020
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:32,535
I'm Going To Meet
You In There

1021
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:34,336
In An Hour
From Now, Okay?

1022
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:35,338
I'm Not Going
In There.

1023
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:36,339
Yes, It's...
You'll Be Fine.

1024
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:37,340
Hey, Come Here.

1025
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,841
Come Here,
Take That.

1026
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:40,342
Just Take That.

1027
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:41,844
I'll Meet You In
The Bar, Okay?

1028
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:42,845
All Right.

1029
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:46,849
Georgia?

1030
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:51,354
Georgia?

1031
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,763
Lovely Boys.

1032
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:16,479
There You Are.

1033
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:19,482
Now, What'll
You Have, Ladies?

1034
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:20,983
I'll Have Some Of
What She's Having.

1035
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:21,985
What's That?

1036
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:23,486
It's A Kind
Of Fancy Orange.

1037
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:25,488
A Kind Of Fancy Orange?

1038
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:26,489
Two Of Those, Please.

1039
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:29,492
Two Of Those Things...

1040
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:30,993
And, Uh, For Me,

1041
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:33,296
A Coffee With
Just A Little Milk And No Sugar.

1042
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,299
Excuse Me? Okay?

1043
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,302
Huh.

1044
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:42,104
Good, Huh?

1045
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:46,409
Georgia, You're Going To
Get Us Chucked Out Of Here.

1046
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:47,910
You're Not
Supposed To Smoke.

1047
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:49,711
Darling, We've Had
This Discussion.

1048
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:54,216
Have You Seen
The Paintings?

1049
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:56,219
Hmm? What?

1050
01:00:58,721 --> 01:00:59,521
Huh!

1051
01:00:59,522 --> 01:01:01,223
Hazel Did These.

1052
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:05,327
Good Lord!

1053
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,731
Well Done, My Dear.

1054
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:10,432
Well Done.

1055
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:16,138
Cheers.

1056
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:17,640
Donald, You Should
Have One Of These.

1057
01:01:19,742 --> 01:01:22,444
Trouble Is, Once I
Start, I Can't Stop.

1058
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:26,449
I Drank My Way Through
Two Family Fortunes.

1059
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:29,952
One Day, I
Was Sitting In My Chambers,

1060
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:30,953
And Three Of My
Colleagues Came In,

1061
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:32,955
And Suggested
That I Retire.

1062
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:37,160
I Thought...

1063
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,661
I've Got A Few
Years To Go Yet.

1064
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:39,662
But, No...

1065
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:42,665
They Insisted I
Retire That Afternoon.

1066
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:47,270
And I Hope
Nobody Knew.

1067
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:51,473
Hey, Lady?

1068
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:54,177
You're On.

1069
01:02:03,986 --> 01:02:05,687
Every Now And Then When
My Room Would Get Too Full,

1070
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:06,689
Heather Would Bring Them
Down To A Dealer In Town

1071
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:08,190
And He'd...
He'd Sell Them.

1072
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:12,995
I Had A
Boyfriend Once.

1073
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:15,498
He Was A
Painter, Too.

1074
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:18,000
We Were Going To
Set Up A Studio Together But...

1075
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,202
My Father
Didn't Approve.

1076
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:23,706
He Didn't Consider
It A Proper Career For A Man.

1077
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:25,708
Certainly Not
A Man Who Wanted To Marry His Daughter.

1078
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:32,214
He Said That
Artists Were A Bunch Of...

1079
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:35,218
"Sexually Depraved
Reprobates, And Drug Addicts".

1080
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:36,719
So He Banned Him
From The House,

1081
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:38,220
And He Locked Me
In My Room.

1082
01:02:39,722 --> 01:02:41,724
He Kept Me
There For...

1083
01:02:43,726 --> 01:02:44,727
Months.

1084
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:50,233
If It Hadn't Have
Been For Heather,

1085
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:52,235
I Don't Know What
I'd Have Done.

1086
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:53,736
Yes!

1087
01:02:55,738 --> 01:02:57,740
She Gave Up A Lot
To Be With Me During That Time.

1088
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:01,744
Yes!

1089
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:03,045
God... My Heart!

1090
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:28,370
Clear The Way,
Get Out Of The Way...

1091
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:37,779
Yes!

1092
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:47,389
Woo!

1093
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:09,312

Are You Okay?

1120
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:54,616
Hello, Darling.

1121
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,619
Mmm.

Happy Christmas,
You Nutcase.

1131
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:48,670

Hobo-Man.

1132
01:06:52,074 --> 01:06:54,076
I Got Him. I Got Him.

1133
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:02,484
Oh...

1134
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:03,486
I Keep Forgetting.

1135
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:09,992
I'm Old.

1136
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:15,998
I Don't
Notice Things.

1137
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,001
You've Got A Few
Little Hairs In There.

1138
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:21,003
Hairs? They're
Walrus Whiskers!

1139
01:07:22,505 --> 01:07:24,006
I Can Help You
Get Rid Of Them,

1140
01:07:24,006 --> 01:07:25,707

1141
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:26,709

Ah!

1146
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,225
Oh... God,
I'm So Sorry.

Okay, Okay.

1150
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:18,160
Auntie Floss.

1151
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:20,162
She Was
A Wild One.

1152
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:26,668
Hazel...

1153
01:08:26,669 --> 01:08:29,171
All I Want Is
For You And Me,

1154
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:32,174
To Be The Same As
We Were Before.

1155
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:34,176
I Don't Know If
That's Possible.

1156
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:38,680
I'm Trying
To Understand Why You Did It.

1157
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:49,692
I Was Afraid.

1158
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:54,696
I Was Absolutely
Terrified...

1159
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:56,198
That He Would
Come Back,

1160
01:08:56,198 --> 01:08:57,699
And He Would Take
You Away From Me.

1161
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,702
And I Can't Bear
To Be Without You.

1162
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:03,706
Sure, You're
My Sister.

1163
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:08,210
I'll Always
Love You.

1164
01:09:11,714 --> 01:09:14,717
We'll Just...

1165
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:16,719
We'll Have
To Move On.

1166
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:20,723
You Know, Maybe...

1167
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:23,225
Maybe We Should
Go And Meet Him.

1168
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:26,728
Together.

1169
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:29,731
In The New Year.

1170
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,371
Oh... Well Done.

1171
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:16,178
Hello, Donald.

1172
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:18,180
I Was, Uh...
I Was Saving Them,

1173
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:19,381
In Case I Went On
The Drink Again.

1174
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:20,382
Oh Dear!

1175
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:22,884
I Wanted To Do
It In Style.

1176
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:27,589
Oh, Ellie, This
Is Beautiful.

1177
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:31,694

1178
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:34,096
Oh, The Diva, As Usual,
Keeping Us Waiting.

1179
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:35,597

1180
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:49,811
Well?

1181
01:10:51,513 --> 01:10:53,014
Not Bad.

1182
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:54,516
Not Bad At All.

1183
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:56,417
Don't Look
Bad Yourself.

1184
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,922
I Never Thought
I'd Say This But...

1185

Beautiful, My Dear.

1186
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:08,030

01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:44,046
Things Would
Be Different.

1247
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:47,549
But They're
Just The Same.

1248
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,151
I Don't Like
Being Old.

1249
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:53,154
It's Shit!

1250
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:55,157
Being Old Is A Pain
In The Arse.

1251
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:58,861
So Is Being
Sober.

1252
01:14:58,861 --> 01:15:00,863
I Have Just
The Thing For You.

1253

<i>Let There Be Birds</i>

1262
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:16,938
<i>To Sing In The Trees</i>

1263

<i>Someone To Bless Me</i>

1264
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:24,947

1265
01:16:25,948 --> 01:16:29,451

01:16:33,956 --> 01:16:35,958
<i>But First Of All</i>

1268
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:40,062
<i>Please
Let There Be Love</i>

1269
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:51,173
Ugh...

1270
01:16:57,879 --> 01:16:59,881
Oh Fuck!

1271
01:16:59,881 --> 01:17:01,482
What A Great Day Yesterday Was.

1272
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:04,986
It Was Fun!

1273
01:17:04,987 --> 01:17:05,988
Morning!

1274
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:08,991
Where's
Miss Harris?

1275
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:10,993
Uh, Kate?
She, Um...

1276
01:17:10,993 --> 01:17:12,995
She Had To Leave
For A Few Days.

1277
01:17:12,995 --> 01:17:14,496
Who The Hell
Are You?

1278
01:17:14,496 --> 01:17:15,997
I'm Mr. Evans.

1279
01:17:15,998 --> 01:17:17,499
Department Of Health.

1280
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:19,400
That's Who I Am.

1281
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:21,903
I Can't Believe
That Anyone Would Be That Irresponsible.

1282
01:17:21,903 --> 01:17:23,004
Please, Would You
Let Me Explain?

1283
01:17:23,005 --> 01:17:24,606
No, There's No Excuse For
What Miss Harris Has Done.

1284
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:25,907
It's Illegal!

1285
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:27,808
Not To Mention
Downright Dangerous

1286
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:29,811
To Leave Residents
Unattended At Any Time!

1287
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:31,712
There Isn't Even
A Carer Here.

1288
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:34,215
No Nurse,
No Cook, Nobody.

1289
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:36,518
It's An Outrageous
Breach Of Regulations.

1290
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:38,520
I'll Be Writing
My Report

1291
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,021
And You Can Be Damn
Sure I'll See To It

1292
01:17:40,022 --> 01:17:41,523
That Miss Harris'
Licence Is Revoked.

1293
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:43,925
She Isn't Fit To Manage It.

1294
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:46,728
You Needn't Worry.

1295
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:48,229
The Department

1296
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:50,532
Will Find Alternative
Accommodation For You.

1297
01:17:50,532 --> 01:17:52,033
I Don't Want To Go.

1298
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:53,535
I Love It Here.

1299
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,235
All Our Friends
Are Here!

1300
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:57,339
And We May Not Be
A Proper Family.

1301
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:59,240
You Know, Maybe A
Dysfunctional Family

1302
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:00,742
But We Are A Family
Nonetheless.

1303
01:18:00,742 --> 01:18:03,745
Mmm. And Miss Harris
Did Not Leave Us.

1304
01:18:03,745 --> 01:18:05,246
We Chose To Stay.

1305
01:18:07,749 --> 01:18:09,250
Heather Has Cooked A Goose.

1306
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:10,852
I Believe There's A...

1307
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:13,754
Bottle Of Wine
Or Two Left.

1308
01:18:13,755 --> 01:18:16,457
Why Don't
You Join Us For Dinner?

1309
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:29,170
Just Throwing
The Dog A Bone.

1310
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:38,580
I Really Fucked
Up This Time.

1311
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:41,082
It's Not
Your Fault.

1312
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:43,085
What Kind Of
A Sad Bastard

1313
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:45,087
Would Do A Job
Like That?

1314
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:47,589
And At
Christmas?

1315
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:50,592
Oh, I Need
A Drink.

1316
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:57,499
It's Him, Ellie.

1317
01:18:57,499 --> 01:18:59,000
Beep-Beep!

1318
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,001
Oh, No!

1319
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:02,003
I Thought
He'd Be Back.

1320
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:04,505
Why Can't He Ring
The Bell Like A Normal Person?

1321
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:06,508
Don't Let
Him Give You Any Bullshit!

1322
01:19:11,513 --> 01:19:12,514
Where Are
We Going?

1323
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:14,015
Where Are
We Going? I Hope...

1324
01:19:14,015 --> 01:19:17,518
I Hope She Doesn't
Fall For Any Of His Bullshit.

1325
01:19:20,522 --> 01:19:22,023
Back, Hurry, Hurry.

1326
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:26,528
What's She Saying?
What's She Saying?

1327
01:19:26,528 --> 01:19:28,530
Oh, That Swine!

1328
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:32,533
She's Done It!

1329
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:35,036
Get Back, Back, Back,
Back, Back, Back...

1330
01:19:35,036 --> 01:19:36,037
Oh!

1331
01:19:55,557 --> 01:19:57,559
Some People
Never Take "No" For An Answer.

1332
01:19:57,559 --> 01:19:59,561
Why Don't You
Just Fuck Off?

1333
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:06,067
We Have To Set
Another Place For Dinner!

1334
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:14,075
I Didn't Mean
To Upset You.

1335
01:20:14,075 --> 01:20:15,276
I'm Sorry.

1336
01:20:15,277 --> 01:20:17,279
It's Just That...

1337
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:21,683
His Wife Just
Left Him.

1338

Time Ever...

1340
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:32,994

Ellie.

1343
01:20:54,716 --> 01:20:56,217
Lovely Boys!

1344
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:58,220
Here We Are.

1345
01:20:58,220 --> 01:20:59,221
Whoop...

1346
01:22:13,995 --> 01:22:15,496
I Knew I'd
Find You Here.

1347
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:26,307
It's Beautiful,
Isn't It?

1348

Mmm.

1349
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:34,816
So, Where
To First?

1350
01:22:34,816 --> 01:22:36,818
I Don't Know.

1351
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:40,822
I Want To Stay With
Mum For A Few Days,

1352
01:22:40,822 --> 01:22:41,823

Anywhere.

1353

Good.

1354
01:22:42,824 --> 01:22:45,326

Really Pleased.

1355
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:47,329

The Entire Week

1356

You This Time?

1357
