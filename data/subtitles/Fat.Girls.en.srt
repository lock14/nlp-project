Both day and night

8
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:45,574
I get so bored

9
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,407
If only

10
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,479
I could find

11
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,479
Alive or dead

12
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:53,413
A man, a body

13
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,417
An animal

14
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,317
I don 't mind

15
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,992
Just to dream

16
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:02,588

00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,354

Both day and night

21
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,165
I get so bored

22
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:15,865
If only

23
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,839
I could find

24
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,636
Man or woman

25
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,438
A body, a soul

26
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,445
A werewolf

27
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,345
I couldn 't care less

28
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,020
Just to dream...

29
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:35,053
When you fall for a boy,
you try to pin him down too soon.

30
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,025
Affter three days,
he wants to kick his way free

31
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,860
and get as far away as he can.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,994
Oh, yeah? So Iet's see
who can pick up a decent boy first.

33
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,699
I'II be generous.
Doesn't even have to be decent.

34
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,274
Any boy.

35
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,842
Even a fat slob Iike you.

36
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,104
That shows how dumb you are.

37
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,272
You're great physically,

38
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,146
but once they get to know you,
they run a mile.

39
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,445
They run before even
getting to know you!

40
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,180
I'm just too young.

41
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,084
They'd be scared to sleep with me.

42
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,419
But you reek of Ioose morals.

43
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:09,960
I don't sleep around.

44
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,722
That's the only thing you don't do.

45
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,430
You have a weird notion
of what "not sleeping around" means.

46
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,330
That's what matters, you know.

47
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,063
I don't think so.

48
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:23,538
If I meet a man I Iove,
I'd want to be broken in.

49
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:26,770
He won't think my first time counts.

50
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:29,609
The first time should be with nobody.

51
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,376
I don't want a guy bragging
he had me first.

52
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:33,951
Guys are all sick.

53
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,509
I'm wiped out.

54
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,883
- Oh, come on!
- I thought you wanted a drink.

55
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,792
That place is a dump.

56
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,228
You can sit here if you Iike.

57
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,904
Tell your friend -
- My sister.

58
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,971
You can't just sit down.
You ask if people mind.

59
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:08,741
I don't mind.
I asked you to.

60
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:12,441
Go ahead.

61
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,647
It's very kind of you.

62
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:21,385
When there's no seats free
and you're thirsty and tired,

63
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,023
it's nice to find someone friendly.

64
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:27,155
- Fernando.
- EIena.

65
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,595
My Iittle sister, Anaïs.

66
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,670
Don't just stand there, you Iump.

67
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,788
What would you Iike?

68
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,254
Coffee.

69
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:58,091
Are you Italian?
- Yes, from Rome.

70
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,027
A banana split - my favorite.

71
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,116
We're on vacation here,
staying at the Residence.

72
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,717
It's nice because it's quiet but...

73
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,948
we can't get out easily.

74
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,656
We're not allowed.

75
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,355
Speak for yourself.

76
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,892
Don't worry.

77
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,503
He can't understand
a word you're saying.

78
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,130
He's just being polite.

79
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,368
No, it's okay.

80
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,604
But can you speak more slowly?

81
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,011
I need to improve my French.

82
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,915
I'm in high school.

83
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:01,788
I just finished sophomore year.
I'II be a junior next year.

84
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,957
I don't know what I'm gonna do Iater,
but it's handy, see.

85
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,933
It's part Iiterature,
and part science.

86
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:14,666
High school.

87
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:17,207
That was Iong ago.
I'm in college.

88
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,537
I study Iaw. Avvocato.

89
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,580
You're in college?
That must be different. You're free.

90
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,317
That's the problem.

91
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,081
You're not required
to attend classes,

92
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,693
but you have to take final exams.

93
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:38,687
You can always retake them in June,
but if you keep falling behind...

94
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,891
Besides,
my father wouldn't understand.

95
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,401
- What does he do?
- My father?

96
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,267
He's an avvocato internazionale.

97
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,438
Mine's a company director.

98
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,320
Excuse me.
I'm finishing my shifft.

99
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,823
See you back at the gate.

100
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,925
Been waiting Iong?

101
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,763
I almost went home.

102
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,138
You're sweet.

103
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:44,119
- I couldn't believe there was a tornado.
- This is France.

104
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,522
Precisely.
We don't have tornadoes here.

105
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,586
The bed was shaking.
I was terrified.

106
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,296
But I didn't come downstairs to safety.

107
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,765
I pulled the sheets over my head

108
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,462
and decided

109
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,665
to ignore the noise
and go back to sleep.

110
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:06,676
I must have been crazy.
SIeeping wouldn't save me.

111
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,279
- What?
- What are you studying?

112
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:14,511
I'm studying Iaw.
Next year I'II be in my third year.

113
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,653
Criminal Iaw?

114
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,915
Yes, that's what interests me.

115
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:23,184
I think it's much more useful.

116
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:27,162
Of course, I'II study
international Iaw too

117
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,163
to be a business Iawyer.

118
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:33,202
But I'd Iike to start out
working for good causes.

119
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,964
So you'II be in international Iaw.

120
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,234
My father insists on it.

121
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:40,971
He's an international Iawyer
and so, of course,

122
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,809
he'd Iike me to follow
in his footsteps.

123
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,909
Have you gotten acquainted?

124
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:50,053
Is this okay for you?
- Yes, perfect.

125
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,486
I'm putting him on a diet.

126
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,490
You think I'm fat.

127
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,958
No, but you're not thin for your age.

128
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:05,162
- Sure you've got enough?
- I was worried it'd all be gone.

129
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,006
And people wonder why she's fat.

130
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:12,633
It's simple: She eats Iike a pig.
It's all she does.

131
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:16,976
It's not her fault - it's hormonal.
She can't help it.

132
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,343
Maybe so,
but she keeps stuffing herself.

133
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,716
It ruins my appetite.
- Oh, come on.

134
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,116
So, how did you meet my daughters?

135
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,693
François!

136
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,422
Young people meet.

137
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,325
It just happens these days.

138
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,906
I get so bored
It's not over yet

139
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,914
After my life
and my survival

140
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:52,943
After my death
I'll still be bored

141
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,180
More than ever before

142
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,448
If only I could find

143
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:02,620
A specter or a ghost
Woman or man

144
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:06,531
An animal
I don 't mind

145
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,693
To dream...

146
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,006
My Iips are sofft, huh?
I 'm a good kisser.

147
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,938
Yes, you're my Iove,

148
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,480
but I don't want to marry you yet.

149
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,722
Now that I know men Iike me,

150
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,223
I want other experiences.

151
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:41,297
Don't I kiss well?
I've only been kissed once before.

152
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:53,877
Are you jealous?
I didn't really cheat on you.

153
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,174
Women aren't Iike bars of soap,
you know.

154
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,847
They don't wear away.

155
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:05,081
On the contrary,
each Iover brings them more,

156
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,488
and you get all the benefit.

157
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:15,160
You make me sick. How can you
disgust me and attract me so much?

158
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:20,431
You're the one I'II give it all to.

159
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,372
No, I've never slept
with anyone before.

160
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,891
What are you doing? Can't you ask?

161
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,899
- What are you doing?
- Get Iost.

162
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,906
- Going out?
- No, I'm not. How the hell can I?

163
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,710
You didn't invite him here, did you?

164
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,242
Go to sleep.

165
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,413
You hear nothing,
see nothing and know nothing.

166
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,749
No need for makeup
if you're going to sleep.

167
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,285
Go to sleep, okay?

168
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,097
And remember,
mind your own business.

169
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,748
You got the right place.

170
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,956
You said the first door on the Iefft.

171
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,660
My Iittle sister's asleep.

172
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:09,140
The gateman almost didn't Iet me in.

173
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:12,869
- How did you manage?
- I gave him a tip.

174
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,423
Let's put on some music.

175
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,029
We can't.

176
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:36,399
It's no big deal.
- What's a big deal?

177
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:38,927
It's as if...

178
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,969
the music counted more than I do.

179
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,404
As if it meant more to you.

180
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:48,170
I could get offended.

181
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,007
- What?
- Nothing.

182
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,852
I'm sorry
I don't speak French well.

183
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,722
I'd Iike to tell you
all kinds of things.

184
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,900
That you're so pretty.

185
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:15,632
I know. It's hard not being able
to understand each other.

186
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:21,710
To think I could have taken Italian
but chose Spanish instead.

187
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,006
They're machos.

188
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:29,185
I can try to Iearn Italian next year.

189
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,550
No, I have to Iearn French.

190
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,690
I don't see why.

191
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:38,489
When I come to see you in Paris,
I'II have Iearnt French better.

192
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,858
- You'II come to see me in Paris?
- Yes.

193
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,662
I don't actually Iive in Paris.

194
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,801
I Iive just outside.

195
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,166
I have a great house, though.

196
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,744
That's okay,
I'II be coming anyway.

197
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,647
You wear your bra to bed?

198
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,954
No, I forgot to take it off.

199
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,010
Can't you help me?

200
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,616
A boy has to work.

201
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,787
If it's too easy,
there's no pleasure.

202
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:43,656
Don't worry. These things
are always so complicated.

203
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:46,763
Is that true?

204
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,898
You've Ioved a Iot of girls before?
I'm not the first.

205
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:57,106
Of course, you're not the first.

206
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:01,744
I realize that. I'm just asking
if you've had Iots and Iots of girls.

207
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,607
What does it matter?

208
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,453
I'm here with you now.

209
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,257
But how many have you had?

210
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,655
- Not that many.
- How many?

211
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,064
I don't know.

212
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,931
If you don't know, that means Ioads.

213
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,532
You're jealous.

214
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,035
I've never had one Iike you.

215
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,401
Are you sure?

216
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,981
Even if I don't sleep with you
and others do?

217
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,695
That makes a big difference.

218
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:14,009
I haven't been interested
in a virgin since...

219
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,786
Since?

220
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,785
Since I was 1 5.

221
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,720
The other girls all slept with you
on the first date?

222
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,398
First or second, it's the same.

223
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,159
No, it's not the same.

224
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:36,270
You can tell it's all they want.

225
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,209
Sometimes, it's so obvious
it makes me sick.

226
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,376
There was this one once.

227
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,884
She asked me to dinner
and took me to her bedroom.

228
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,453
You're in mine now.

229
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,317
This is different.

230
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,352
We have no choice.
Anyway...

231
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:01,991
someone told me that this girl
had wanted to go out with me

232
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,693
since the start of the year,
but I hadn't noticed.

233
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:10,540
So she asks me to dinner,
and we go to her room.

234
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:15,713
And there we start drinking.
There were four bottles of wine,

235
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,111
just Iike that, as if by chance.
Four of them.

236
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,410
So we start drinking and eat nothing.

237
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,319
I'm thinking,
"You won't get me, bitch."

238
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:28,984
I mean, a girl can't take
as much drink as a guy.

239
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:33,156
So I slow down on my drinking

240
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,095
and keep on filling her glass.

241
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:40,535
At half past midnight,
I tell her, "Sorry.

242
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,402
Got to go. I'II miss the Iast tram.
Good night."

243
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:49,013
I Iefft her blind drunk
and mad at me.

244
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,274
She hasn't spoken to me since.

245
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,407
You didn't Iike her?

246
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,247
She was kind of cute.

247
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:58,252
But I got a kick
out of dumping her Iike that.

248
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,221
Besides, she wasn't the only one.

249
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,854
I've done it Ioads of times.

250
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,496
It's so easy with girls.

251
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,970
Were you in Iove
with the others you've slept with?

252
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:23,010
I know what you're getting at.
You're jealous.

253
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,015
The others don't count.

254
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,649
I only sleep with them
because I'm a guy. That's all.

255
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:35,122
So if you slept with me,

256
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,489
I'd be Iike all the other girls?

257
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:40,529
No.

258
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,597
I'd respect you.

259
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,170
Even if you slept with me?

260
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:52,537
Yes.

261
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,949
Promise you won't do it.

262
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,983
I don't want you to.

263
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,988
I swear on my mother's head

264
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:43,025
I'II stay on the edge.

265
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,158
On the edge doesn't count.

266
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,364
- It does.
- It doesn't.

267
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,228
It does.

268
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:51,993
Because I count.

269
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:55,004
You're the only one who counts.

270
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,952
I'm scared you won't
be able to hold back.

271
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,354
Don't worry about that.
That's my problem.

272
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:18,927
I'm a man. I know if I can
hold back or not. And I can.

273
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,598
But I'd Iike to have you properly.

274
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,601
That's not possible.

275
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:33,944
It's dumb if I have to go
with another girl, a girl I don't Iove.

276
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,942
Will you need to?

277
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,814
Look, I don't want

278
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:47,720
to bring myself off on my own
in the can. That's sick.

279
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,465
I Iove you.

280
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:07,672
I really Iove you.
But give me time.

281
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:40,540
I said I don't want to.

282
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,507
I didn't do anything.

283
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:49,585
I thought you wanted it too.
I didn't do anything.

284
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:04,533
You're spoiling everything,
understand?

285
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,731
You're spoiling it.

286
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,967
It was fine.

287
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:14,203
Yes, it was fine.
Don't you realize it was fine?

288
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,406
I can't.

289
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:49,578
It's not my fault. I can't.
Not Iike this, straight off.

290
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:05,323
I didn't trick you.

291
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:11,860
I warned you.

292
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,028
I'm not a cocktease.

293
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:15,763
Are you crazy?

294
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:19,672
How can I resist if you press up
against me Iike that?

295
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:22,238
You think I'm some kind of saint?

296
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:26,175
You can't see
what you're doing to me, huh?

297
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,085
You think it's good for me?

298
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:36,090
No.

299
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,426
But...

300
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,590
Don't you think it's best
to do it for the first time

301
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:46,001
with someone who Ioves you?

302
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:47,730
Yes.

303
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,086
That would be a proof of Iove,

304
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:09,056
a real proof of Iove,

305
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:12,959
from you to me,
and from me to you too.

306
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:17,566
I mean, there are Ioads of guys

307
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:21,068
who take off
when they see a girl's a virgin.

308
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:24,402
It's too much hassle,
too much responsibility, see.

309
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,010
They come back
once the job's been done.

310
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,872
- Really?
- Yes.

311
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,607
That's sick.

312
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:38,322
If not, I'II need to find
another girl older than you.

313
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:43,492
That's sick too,
and I don't want to do that.

314
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,396
I don't want to.

315
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,366
You're a Iittle girl.

316
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,709
A Iittle girl who Iooks Iike a woman.

317
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:12,252
You have to forgive men.

318
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,790
You're not mad at me?

319
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,798
Are you crazy?

320
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:28,235
I'm mad about you.

321
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,355
If you were kind...

322
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,091
If I was kind?

323
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,803
AII the girls take it the back way.

324
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,102
- AII the girls?
- Yes.

325
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,339
That way, it doesn't count.

326
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,946
They can say that
they've never slept with anyone.

327
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,018
- That's sick.
- It isn't.

328
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,556
It's not sick.
It's a proof of Iove.

329
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:25,854
If you Iove me the way I Iove you...

330
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,527
I feel Iike crying.

331
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:12,160
No, you mustn't.

332
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,401
You mustn't.
That was a wonderful gifft.

333
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:21,069
Didn't you feel what it did for me?

334
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,713
Yes, but I'm ashamed.

335
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:37,920
You've shown your Iove for me.
It was a proof of Iove.

336
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:42,761
A proof of Iove, see.

337
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:46,166
From me to you and from you to me.

338
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,048
Do you Iove me all the same?

339
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:05,920
Yes.

340
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,920
Don't worry.

341
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:13,826
You're the kind of girl

342
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:16,365
that men dream of marrying.

343
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:20,231
You'd Iike to marry me?

344
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:24,972
If you weren't so young, yeah.

345
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:34,377
I have to take my exams first.

346
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:36,881
Would you wait for me?

347
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,856
What else am I doing
but waiting for you?

348
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,229
Stay.

349
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:54,836
Yes.

350
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:42,176
It's morning.

351
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:45,316
I have to get back.

352
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:25,223
You know what I'd Iike before I go?

353
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:32,427
I'd Iike you to take me in your mouth.

354
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,632
Not with my Iittle sister here.

355
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,433
She's asleep.

356
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:47,275
She might be pretending.
You don't know her.

357
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,044
She's jealous.

358
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:52,247
She won't accept
that I'm older than her.

359
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,117
She's sleeping, okay?

360
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,161
It would really bother me
if she saw me.

361
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:07,803
I want to get some sleep!

362
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:11,668
I'm sick of you rattling on.
- You're awake?

363
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:16,204
You've been spying on us all night?

364
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:21,012
No, I've been trying to sleep.
I don't care about you screwing.

365
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,710
You Iittle bitch!

366
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,787
You're calling me a bitch?

367
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,017
That's a good one!

368
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:34,288
My sister Iets some guy
fondle her all night Iong,

369
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,957
never thinking about me,
and I'm the bitch!

370
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,137
Are you mad at me?

371
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:52,211
I feel dirty.
I don't feel comfortable.

372
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,954
- Because of my sister?
- No, it's not her.

373
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:05,961
What should be natural
between two people in Iove is so -

374
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,722
Well, it's sinister.

375
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,730
I don't want it to happen again, see?

376
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,837
You want to split up?

377
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:28,512
I want to Iove you.

378
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:37,384
Next time.

379
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:42,966
Next time we'II do it.
You want to? You still want to?

380
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,563
Answer me!

381
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,367
Of course.

382
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,840
If you'd said no, I'd have died.

383
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:25,002
I'II be your first Iover.

384
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:29,943
The very first.
The one who introduces you to Iove.

385
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,883
You'II always remember me.

386
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:38,647
Even with other guys Iater,

387
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,884
I'II always be the first.

388
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:44,289
Won't you remember me?

389
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,986
Guys aren't Iike girls.

390
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:47,721
You'II never Ieave me, then.

391
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:12,984
Stop.

392
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:16,992
Stop it.

393
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,294
You'II catch cold. Stop it.

394
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,059
No, I'm not cold.

395
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:38,403
You know what I risk back home
if we're found together?

396
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:39,844
Tell me.

397
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,077
I'II go to prison.

398
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:44,551
It's too dangerous. You're not 1 6.

399
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,986
That's not fair.
It's me who wants it.

400
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,073
See, it wasn't me who stopped first.

401
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,910
Next time,

402
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:15,242
I'II teach you all about Iove.

403
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,699
Returned goods?
In the returned goods column!

404
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:41,305
There's a Iot? No difference.

405
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:44,913
What the hell have you done?
It was going smoothly,

406
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,640
and once I turn my back...

407
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:48,910
You want me to come back, huh?

408
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:57,252
I'm telling you,
that jerk will make me go back.

409
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:01,429
No, Iet them get by
on their own for once.

410
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,760
Enjoy your vacation for now.

411
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:07,262
You think it's easy
to start up a company?

412
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:12,338
Everything's so sluggish at first
before it takes off.

413
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,273
If you pick the wrong path,

414
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:16,673
things happen fast.

415
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:20,511
One asshole and you can go broke.

416
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,749
- Oh, come on.
- It's the old idol with feet of clay.

417
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:29,758
You're way ahead of the competition.
You feel strong.

418
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:33,524
And you get done in
by cash flow problems.

419
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:36,725
Eat. It'II take your mind off things.

420
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:42,228
- What's Anaïs doing?
- Showing off.

421
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:46,337
- Anaïs!
- Don't shout. I'II get her.

422
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:17,369
Okay, I was a bit hard on you,
but I had my reasons.

423
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:22,177
I've just got a temper.
It's not your fault.

424
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:24,506
I'm sick of being
your ball and chain.

425
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:26,781
You're not my ball and chain.

426
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:30,079
But if you're not with me,
they'II never Iet me out.

427
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:31,882
They Iike me to drag you along.

428
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:34,182
See? You "drag me along."

429
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,723
Yes, tomorrow.

430
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,264
No, the morning's best.
Ah, well, never mind.

431
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,461
Ten past 8:00.

432
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:50,472
About time!

433
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:54,641
What's the sense in being here
if we don't eat together?

434
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:03,878
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing.

435
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,356
I should hope not!

436
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:15,026
I'm not working myself to death
to see a face Iike that on vacation!

437
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:22,135
In fact, I can't take a vacation,
and I'm the only one not sulking!

438
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:23,705
Look at you all!

439
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:28,703
I'm glad you're so happy.
Thank God I'm Ieaving tomorrow.

440
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:31,713
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with her?

441
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:34,180
It's adolescence.
She'II get over it.

442
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:37,278
She'd better get over it fast.

443
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,802
It can't be serious.
You haven't Iost your appetite.

444
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,146
Come on, eat.

445
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:13,083
It'II do you good.

446
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,323
Eating takes your mind off things.

447
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:00,369
François, you almost forgot this.

448
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:03,931
If he's flying back -

449
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:07,305
What of it?
We'II go home by car.

450
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:10,242
I'II drive.

451
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:15,381
We'II use highway rest stops
when I'm tired.

452
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,384
It'II just take Ionger.

453
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:19,146
You'II be driving?

454
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:24,319
Oh, come on. I can do it.
I just don't Iike to.

455
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:46,279
Every year, I wonder
how Iong your dad will Iast.

456
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:49,318
He broke his record this time.

457
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,778
He can't stand vacations.

458
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:55,356
And he can't stand his partners
being on vacation either.

459
00:44:56,694 --> 00:45:00,186
You'II see. He'II have them
back at work in no time.

460
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,229
I guess I'm not Iike him.

461
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,092
I understand him.

462
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:06,827
Vacations suck.

463
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:26,913
Not again!

464
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:29,992
You're not getting
the exact same dress as me.

465
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:32,059
Aren't you sick of copying me?

466
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:34,660
Try to be original for once.

467
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,264
It's a different color.

468
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:37,991
It's the same dress.

469
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:42,330
I'm stuck with you all the time,
and now you copy me.

470
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:45,066
I didn't know
you chose the same one.

471
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,107
I think it's the best one too.

472
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:49,711
You could take my boyfriend too

473
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,872
and say, "I didn't see
he was already yours."

474
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:54,813
He's not yours. He's not a dog.

475
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:58,818
He is mine. And you're just a bitch,
trying to copy me.

476
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:02,116
You don't stand a chance.
You'II never be Iike me.

477
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:05,717
You must be joking!
I don't want to be Iike you.

478
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:09,227
Well you'd better not copy me
in any case.

479
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,260
I didn't realize it was the same one.

480
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:30,515
Shorter.

481
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:40,428
I want it shorter.

482
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:42,758
It's prettier below the knee.

483
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:47,895
I'm the one wearing it,
and I want it shorter.

484
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,339
Let me do it.

485
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:54,068
A real mule.
I can't do a thing with her.

486
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:21,968
It's pretty creepy out here.

487
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:25,266
I think so, at Ieast.
I feel really uneasy.

488
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:28,669
You're wrong.
It's great out here.

489
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:31,276
You can't even see the road.

490
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:35,012
I hope we Iose our way
and never get out,

491
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,517
Iike in an ancient Iegend.

492
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:39,484
Good idea.

493
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:26,897
I've set my heart to rot away

494
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:30,938
On the windowsill

495
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,002
I trust in a future day

496
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:37,345
The crows may come
I hope they will

497
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:40,243
With their beaks so fleet

498
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:44,045
They will peck away

499
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:47,088
At this lump of raw meat

500
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:50,385
O'er which you thought you held sway

501
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:53,223
I've set my heart to rot away

502
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:57,526
On the windowsill

503
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:00,364
For the joyless joy of the day

504
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:03,437
My worries fall still

505
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:07,206
If you see the flock

506
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:10,608
Of crows fighting o 'er it

507
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:13,341
Throw them not a rock

508
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:16,747
For I am worth not a bit

509
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:19,412
I've set my heart to rot away

510
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:23,423
On the windowsill

511
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,323
I trust in a future day

512
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:29,829
When the crows come, if they will

513
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,628
With their beaks so fleet

514
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:36,237
They will peck away

515
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:39,102
At this lump of raw meat

516
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:42,472
O'er which you thought you held sway

517
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:34,956
SIut.

518
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:55,803
No one would think we're sisters.

519
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:02,848
It's true.
We don't take affter anyone.

520
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,192
It's Iike we're born of ourselves.

521
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:17,028
It's funny. We really have
nothing in common. Look at you.

522
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:21,266
You have small, hard eyes,

523
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:24,337
while mine are hazy.

524
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,075
But when I Iook deep into your eyes,

525
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,548
it makes me feel Iike I belong,

526
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,444
as if they were my eyes.

527
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:41,824
I feel the same thing.

528
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:45,491
That's why we're sisters.

529
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:48,894
When I hate you,
I Iook at you and then I can't.

530
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,228
It's Iike hating part of myself.

531
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:58,304
That's why I Ioathe you so violently,

532
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,606
because you ought to be Iike me.

533
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:07,782
But at times I have the feeling
you're the exact opposite.

534
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:09,646
I feel that too.

535
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:18,325
That's why you make me angrier
than anyone else.

536
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:23,762
I don't Iet you get away with anything.

537
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:29,665
You have no rights,
whereas I have a say in your Iife.

538
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:34,238
We hate each other
because we're raised as rivals.

539
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:37,143
It's Dad and Mom's fault.

540
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:39,009
And yet it's not their fault.

541
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:42,511
They think it's good,
that it stimulates us.

542
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,349
I think you hated it
when I came along.

543
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:48,956
I mean,

544
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:52,758
when I was a baby,
you played mommy with me.

545
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:55,255
But when I got bigger -

546
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:57,297
Fatter, you mean!

547
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,195
Bitch.

548
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:02,767
When I could start belting you
for bossing me around,

549
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,668
when you couldn't play
mommy anymore,

550
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:10,108
and when I caught up with you
Ianguage-wise too.

551
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,171
Really? I don't remember that.

552
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:16,411
Are you sure
you aren't making it up?

553
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:20,486
No, I remember it really well.

554
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:25,991
The day your passion
for educating me ended

555
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:31,762
was when we were in bed one evening,
in our pink twin beds,

556
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:36,496
and for some reason you Iaunched
into a speech, bossing me around.

557
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:40,437
And wham, I pounced on you.

558
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:45,148
I was pleased because
you called Mom to complain

559
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:49,551
that I'd pinched you really hard,
and you had two big bruises.

560
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:53,383
Since that day,

561
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,590
the wind's gone out of your sails.

562
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:02,756
You've never bossed me around again.

563
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:05,332
I don't remember that at all.

564
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:07,333
I remember it perfectly.

565
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:12,365
I was nice with you.
I'd wheel you in your stroller

566
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:14,942
and call myself Mommy Lélaine.

567
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,940
- I hated that.
- You did?

568
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:43,029
You have to admit, it's pretty unfair.

569
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:46,937
You're allowed to do things
two years sooner than I could.

570
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:53,882
Yes, I'm not denying that's unfair.

571
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:58,811
If not, there's no advantage
in being second.

572
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:04,684
Besides, so many people don't bother
to remember which one's which

573
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:08,958
since we have the same surname.
I mean, we're not alike.

574
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:11,429
That's for sure, we're not alike!

575
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:12,728
Bitch!

576
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:15,703
I wasn't being mean.

577
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:22,941
Want me to tell you a secret?

578
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,923
Fernando gave me this.

579
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:47,230
It's an engagement ring.

580
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:51,905
A mauve opal.
- He can't have given you that.

581
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,774
You're out of your mind.

582
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:55,773
There must be a catch.

583
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,278
No. This way, we're engaged now.

584
00:56:59,115 --> 00:56:59,979
It's a pact.

585
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:03,410
I need to get it fitted.

586
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:06,954
- When did he give you that?
- In the dunes.

587
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:12,219
Something's fishy.
I don't think you should have accepted.

588
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,954
It's not right. It's too valuable.

589
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:17,998
Hold on.
I didn't want some shitty ring!

590
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:20,294
Where the hell did he get it?

591
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,302
His grandmother Iefft it to him.

592
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:28,004
I think I'm going
to give myself to him tonight.

593
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:31,305
You use some really
weird expressions.

594
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:34,882
If he uses a condom,
I'II Iet him go all the way.

595
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:37,810
Spare me the details, please.

596
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:42,782
You have no idea how scared I am.

597
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:45,524
Still, I have to go
through it one day.

598
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,125
So it may as well
be with someone I Iove.

599
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:56,401
What do you think?
What do you suggest?

600
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:02,242
In any case, between
what you've already done and that,

601
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:05,404
there's no moral difference
in my opinion.

602
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:07,539
There's a world of difference!

603
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:11,648
Personally, I want my first time

604
00:58:11,855 --> 00:58:13,720
to be with a boy I don't Iove.

605
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:15,923
Because affterwards

606
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:21,062
you realize he doesn't Iove you
or you don't Iove him, and you feel dumb.

607
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:24,392
You'II see when you fall in Iove.

608
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,362
I doubt it.

609
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:29,869
In any case, don't mind me.

610
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,073
Kiss me.

611
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:16,242
I'm scared.

612
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:19,947
Be gentle.
- No.

613
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:22,649
One hard push is best, then it's over.

614
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,321
- No, gently.
- Trust me.

615
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:55,239
Do audiences come to see you

616
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:58,643
for kicks or what?

617
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,143
No, not at all.

618
01:02:02,752 --> 01:02:04,617
Why not? Why?

619
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:08,279
True, my show tackles sexual issues.

620
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:10,949
There's no sex, that's different.

621
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:13,823
Maybe I confuse
sex and sexual issues.

622
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:18,729
It's an investigation
of sexual issues. That's all.

623
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,728
Its a big problem in France.

624
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:26,173
You have Bardot,
who is a sexual issue.

625
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:28,935
No, she's a case, not an issue.

626
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:31,512
She's a case, so she's an issue.

627
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:35,208
You should read
what De Beauvoir wrote.

628
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:38,182
She wrote some great things.
I love Bardot,

629
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:40,082
but she's a sexual issue.

630
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:42,985
So why do you investigate this issue?

631
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:48,220
It's a simple and obvious issue
that everyone can understand.

632
01:02:48,364 --> 01:02:51,356
It's a very simple human issue.

633
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:54,368
And no one is perfect on that level.

634
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:57,971
Things are more complicated
with other issues,

635
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:00,632
given the confusion in the world.

636
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:03,973
How about you?
How do you fall short on that level?

637
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:06,613
I'm not saying.

638
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:16,285
She's great, isn't she?

639
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:22,929
I 'II never know the people
I 'd Iike to know. I was born too Iate.

640
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:33,636
Excuse me.
Is this the Pingot home?

641
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:36,403
Come now,
it's not a difficult question.

642
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:39,446
Still, I suppose it's stupid
to expect an answer.

643
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,947
In that case, I'II come in.

644
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:45,852
I'm Fernando's mother.

645
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:48,718
I'm sorry.
I just walked right in.

646
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:51,621
Are you EIena's mother?

647
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:56,120
Am I disturbing you.
- Not at all!

648
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:59,496
The moss grows so fast
with all this wet grass.

649
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:04,334
This is very awkward, you see.
Very awkward indeed.

650
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:07,434
No, not at all. Really.

651
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:12,807
It's an awkward situation.

652
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:14,540
- Not at all.
- I'm bothering you.

653
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:18,312
No. I really must compliment you.
Your son is -

654
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:23,350
It's an awkward situation.

655
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:26,427
I don't know where to begin.

656
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:29,794
You know, every summer,

657
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:33,901
I always bring
a few valuable jewels along.

658
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:39,766
Some precious,
others just costume jewelry, you see.

659
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:43,204
I don't check on them every day.

660
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:46,179
Trouble is, they're memories.

661
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:49,249
Rings represent the men

662
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:52,546
whom you managed
to make understand

663
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:56,784
that they should
offer them to you, you see?

664
01:04:56,926 --> 01:04:58,325
I don't understand.

665
01:04:58,494 --> 01:05:01,292
Besides, it's totally ridiculous

666
01:05:01,497 --> 01:05:06,764
to give such a valuable ring
to some young girl

667
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,929
whom you just happen to meet

668
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:11,471
on vacation.

669
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:13,199
It's totally absurd!

670
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:15,241
What ring? What do you mean?

671
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:18,311
My mauve opal.

672
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:24,209
I don't understand how she could have
accepted it just Iike that.

673
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:29,319
My son is too young to dispose
of my property. I'm not dead yet!

674
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:32,221
And I don't intend to die!

675
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:37,691
I don't understand any of this,
but my daughter's not Iike that.

676
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:50,408
There you are.
Where's your sister?

677
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:52,771
I'm not her keeper.

678
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,351
You're crazy.

679
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:59,720
You're always ready to back her up
when she screws up, aren't you?

680
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:02,956
- You're crazy.
- Don't pretend you don't know.

681
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:05,855
She has a ring
that belongs to this Iady.

682
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:09,994
- Couldn't your son come himself?
- Stop it.

683
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:29,543
- You're Ieaving?
- We have to go home one day.

684
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:31,949
- You didn't stay Iong.
- That's Iife.

685
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:37,691
Can we have some music on?

686
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:54,170
I didn't do anything.

687
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:58,576
I get yelled at because of her.

688
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:05,051
And my vacation's been wrecked.

689
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:42,148
Your father wants
to have you examined.

690
01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:50,551
How about a police report too?

691
01:08:51,594 --> 01:08:53,824
Published in the papers?

692
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:57,694
He can't.
- Oh, yes, he can, my girl.

693
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,164
You should have
thought of that first!

694
01:09:01,904 --> 01:09:04,134
I suppose you never had a first time?

695
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:07,274
Did you ask your dad's permission?

696
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:09,070
This isn't about me.

697
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:14,410
I'm sick of it.

698
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:18,616
Stop this playacting!
I'm sick of you sniveling!

699
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:21,050
I can't help crying.

700
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:23,521
Well, cry in silence, then.

701
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,554
Mom.

702
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:34,027
Stop the car, please.
I feel sick.

703
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:48,177
Look at the bitch.

704
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:51,947
She's pleased with herself!
- Shut up.

705
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:54,646
I hate her.

706
01:09:56,258 --> 01:09:58,123
I wish she'd die.

707
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:08,696
I don't care.
I'II die with her.

708
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:10,532
Speak for yourself.

709
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:15,835
I don't want to die.

710
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:19,271
No danger of that.

711
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:22,309
You're not in the dead man's seat.

712
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:33,486
Turn that down! It's horrible!

713
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:37,324
I'm driving.
I need to keep myself company.

714
01:11:47,102 --> 01:11:49,366
People are pigs.

715
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:51,063
Typical French.

716
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:58,011
We have enough to be ashamed of.

717
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:16,060
You're eating again?

718
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:44,057
Mom, that's terrible!

719
01:12:44,226 --> 01:12:45,989
Look who's talking!

720
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:25,149
I'm worn out.

721
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:28,517
I need to sleep a bit.

722
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,306
I have to pee.

723
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:29,706
You think she told dad everything

724
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:32,242
and that he'II have me examined?

725
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:37,518
I don't know.

726
01:17:38,286 --> 01:17:41,278
It's sick that people
think it's their business.

727
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:44,151
It's sick being a virgin.

728
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:48,286
I'm scared.

729
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:55,627
He's a real bastard

730
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:58,500
to have made me think
we were getting engaged.

731
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:02,671
And with his mother's ring, too.

732
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,204
Stop thinking about it.

733
01:18:06,815 --> 01:18:08,373
Go to sleep.

734
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:12,347
I can't stop thinking about it.

735
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:16,685
He was the first.

736
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:20,219
There'II be plenty of others.

737
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:23,058
You won't give them
such a hard time now.

738
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:31,305
Maybe, but I can't stop
thinking about him.

739
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:35,305
Go to sleep.
He's already forgotten you.

740
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:36,843
You bitch.

741
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:38,809
I'm just being honest with you.

742
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:42,113
You deserve better.

743
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:44,476
Now go to sleep.

744
01:18:54,429 --> 01:18:56,693
Lock your door.

745
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:04,583
You're not going to hurt me?

746
01:21:04,726 --> 01:21:06,125
Shut up!

747
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:29,562
She was in the woods.
She says he didn't rape her.

748
01:23:29,738 --> 01:23:32,298
Don't believe me
if you don't want to.

749
01:23:33,305 --> 01:23:39,891
