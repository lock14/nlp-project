1
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,708
Attention.

2
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,250
At ease, gentlemen.
Be seated, please.

3
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,416
As you've all probably noticed,
we're currently headed north.

4
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:24,833
Tomorrow morning at 0500 hours, we will
be taking a position at Yankee Station.

5
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,083
That means we're back in business.

6
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:32,000
We'll be flying sorties over North Vietnam
to take out enemy supply lines,

7
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:35,250
which means we have to cross over
into Laos.

8
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,958
This mission is classified.

9
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:44,208
No cards and letters to sweethearts.
No phone calls to family back home.

10
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,250
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

11
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,041
No one can know.

12
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,875
No one except Charlie
when we kick his ass.

13
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,708
For survival
in the jungle environment,

14
00:03:55,791 --> 00:04:01,083
the smart soldier must understand
that nature is not a force against him.

15
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,708
He has to make nature work for him

16
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:08,208
by utilizing the ample natural provisions
at his disposal.

17
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,250
Is this a double feature?

18
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:15,083
For God's sake, just lean your head back
and open your mouth.

19
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,625
What is this?

20
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,875
Hell, the boys back home
don't know anything about the jungle.

21
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,791
In the jungle,
your best friend is your knife.

22
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,583
Oh, look at...
Now he's getting serious.

23
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:32,041
Cut the leaf, man. Here it goes.
Come on, baby, cut. Cut.

24
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,875
Where is the salt and pepper shaker
for that leaf?

25
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,916
Chew it, boy! Chew it!

26
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:44,375
Leaf good. Me like leaf.

27
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,958
Maintain a constant state
of readiness...

28
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,916
What did he do, sit in an anthill?
Look at him.

29
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,875
And then, when the rescue
helicopter appears, make sure...

30
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,958
Honestly,
it's right above your head!

31
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,791
Jeez. Shake it, Pops.

32
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,249
He's got a nice ass for a sailor,
I'll tell you that.

33
00:05:10,374 --> 00:05:12,749
I don't mean that in a weird way.

34
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,666
God bless America.

35
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,374
Are you a smart soldier?

36
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:23,124
I mean, I just thought we'd be assisting
some South Vietnamese generals

37
00:05:23,249 --> 00:05:26,208
against a few infiltrators. Whole thing
would be done in three, four weeks.

38
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,249
You picked the wrong time

39
00:05:27,374 --> 00:05:28,333
- to enlist, Dengler.
- I know.

40
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,208
No, but I just wanted to fly so badly,

41
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:34,749
and everybody, they were telling me
all about the fantastic massage parlors

42
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,874
and the go-go girls, everything, and...

43
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:39,416
And what did I get?
Goddamn one night?

44
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:42,333
- One night in Saigon. That's me.
- Yeah, and that didn't go so well.

45
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,249
Gentlemen, next please.

46
00:05:46,124 --> 00:05:47,208
Okay.

47
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:49,708
Hey, are there any mosquito nets?

48
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,249
What you see is what you get.

49
00:05:51,374 --> 00:05:54,249
- Okay. Okay. I see plastic.
- Yes, sir.

50
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,916
I see plastic there and how about...

51
00:05:57,041 --> 00:06:00,333
Are you able to give me two
slices of that plastic, please?

52
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,541
- Sir?
- And maybe six foot by three foot,

53
00:06:02,624 --> 00:06:03,749
you put a zipper in the middle,

54
00:06:03,874 --> 00:06:04,874
- and I crawl inside...
- What you're describing

55
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:05,999
is a sauna,
not a mosquito net.

56
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,624
Not a mosquito net,
but it holds off the bugs.

57
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:10,083
And you put some netting on it so I
can breathe through at night time.

58
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,291
- You got it, sir.
- Yes?

59
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,874
- Absolutely, sir.
- Okay.

60
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:16,291
Now, look here. Look at this.
I have my boot on your table.

61
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:19,083
- Why do I have my boot on your table?
- I don't know, sir.

62
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,541
Okay, this is why.
Look at this.

63
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,874
Can you create a flap for me
in the tongue here

64
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:29,333
so I could hide my American passport
inside of here should I need it?

65
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:32,999
You know what, sir? Since you're my only
customer today, it would be my pleasure.

66
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,416
Thank you.

67
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:39,083
So, Charlie got his shit together.

68
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:43,083
Now we have heavy antiaircraft fire
around Mugia Pass.

69
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:46,874
Change direction and
altitude every seven seconds

70
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:50,541
so the radar of the enemy gun
cannot lock onto you.

71
00:06:50,624 --> 00:06:55,499
Your secondary target will be
the intersection of 121 and 90.

72
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:56,624
That's the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

73
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,124
That's right, Spook,
inside Laos.

74
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:00,708
Now, one more thing.

75
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:05,624
They've been using your radios
to lure our rescue teams into ambush.

76
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:09,583
Now, don't get me wrong.
You go down, you use that radio.

77
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,458
But if they're hot on your trail,
you scrap it.

78
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,708
You scrap anything
that they can use against you.

79
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:20,833
Now, this is Flight Lieutenant Dengler's
first mission.

80
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,208
Yes, sir.

81
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,291
You're gonna be Spook's wingman.
You think you can handle that?

82
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:29,083
I could not ask for a better man, sir.
But, please,

83
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,333
- could I ask you a question, sir?
- Go ahead.

84
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,583
You know, Spook is such
a goddamn daredevil,

85
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:38,249
could you please order him not to
try too hard to die for his country,

86
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:42,749
but rather to let the son-of-a-bitch
on the other side die for his instead?

87
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,458
Okay. All right, boys.

88
00:07:46,374 --> 00:07:47,999
- You all set?
- Yes, sir.

89
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,124
Anything else?

90
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:50,416
- No, sir.
- Okay. Let's go, go, go!

91
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:57,124
Radar Kilo, 6195, position four.

92
00:07:57,624 --> 00:08:02,374
Radar Yankee, 67279,
position two.

93
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,124
- Heads against the wall. Come on.
- Come on, Diet.

94
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:07,041
Come here.
This is what we would do as kids

95
00:08:07,124 --> 00:08:09,416
when we were out for mischief.
It would keep us out of trouble.

96
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,708
But we would usually pee right now.

97
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,666
- Can we pee?
- I don't really have to.

98
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:15,083
I'm not gonna.

99
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,208
But this will keep us safe.
Okay, fellas?

100
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,458
Stay out of trouble.
Come back in one piece. Good luck.

101
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,541
- Come back, boys.
- You, too.

102
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:06,291
Boys, get set to change
the altitude again. On my mark.

103
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,166
- Now.
- Roger.

104
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:13,332
Gentlemen, do you notice
the coastline down there?

105
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,249
Welcome to North Vietnam.

106
00:09:18,582 --> 00:09:20,249
It's pretty boring.

107
00:09:23,082 --> 00:09:24,957
Boys, we got too much
cloud cover.

108
00:09:25,082 --> 00:09:28,207
Climbing again 280 west.
We're heading into Laos.

109
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,082
Target in sight.

110
00:09:35,624 --> 00:09:37,332
Lessard, roll in.

111
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,666
Rolling.

112
00:09:46,124 --> 00:09:47,707
Farkas, roll in.

113
00:09:48,207 --> 00:09:49,374
Rolling.

114
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,874
Dengler, roll in.

115
00:09:55,999 --> 00:09:57,374
Rolling in.

116
00:10:14,582 --> 00:10:17,999
I'm hit. I'm hit!

117
00:10:19,582 --> 00:10:22,499
Dieter, you're losing altitude!
Pull it up!

118
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,207
Dieter, pull up!

119
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,499
Dengler, get out of there!

120
00:10:35,624 --> 00:10:37,249
Dieter, bail out!

121
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,957
Dieter, bail out!

122
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,707
I'm not gonna bail out!

123
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,916
I'm not gonna bail out!

124
00:16:27,082 --> 00:16:28,457
Oh, come on.

125
00:16:30,832 --> 00:16:32,040
Come on.

126
00:16:37,082 --> 00:16:39,207
Come on, search planes.

127
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:43,040
Where are you?
Where have you gone?

128
00:16:51,748 --> 00:16:52,957
Come on.

129
00:17:00,748 --> 00:17:03,165
God, how can it get this hot?

130
00:19:19,581 --> 00:19:23,498
Hey. Hey.
I need to go to the bathroom.

131
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,748
I need...

132
00:19:27,331 --> 00:19:29,498
I need to go to the bathroom.

133
00:19:31,123 --> 00:19:33,790
Yeah.
I need to take a shit.

134
00:19:37,956 --> 00:19:40,040
Hey. Hey.

135
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:43,248
I need to take a shit.

136
00:19:55,415 --> 00:19:56,706
Oh, shit.

137
00:19:57,873 --> 00:19:59,456
Hey. Hey.

138
00:20:01,956 --> 00:20:03,956
Does nobody listen to me?

139
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,331
Why doesn't anybody listen around here?

140
00:20:11,456 --> 00:20:12,456
Why don't you listen to me?

141
00:20:12,581 --> 00:20:16,206
I said I needed the bathroom
and now I've shit myself.

142
00:20:16,331 --> 00:20:19,248
Why doesn't anybody listen around here?

143
00:20:19,373 --> 00:20:21,081
I've shit my pants.

144
00:21:56,456 --> 00:22:00,165
They can't hear us.
They can't see us through the treetops.

145
00:22:02,331 --> 00:22:05,040
It's not my fault.
I didn't signal them.

146
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:19,706
Don't ever,
ever do that again!

147
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:23,873
You better just shoot me right away!
Don't you ever do that again!

148
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:04,498
This is unusual.

149
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:08,456
You American pilots normally
attack us earlier in the day. Sit.

150
00:25:13,748 --> 00:25:15,081
No English.

151
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:17,873
German.

152
00:25:26,498 --> 00:25:29,248
Why don't you admit
that you are an American?

153
00:25:38,748 --> 00:25:39,706
Yes.

154
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,498
I am an American citizen,

155
00:25:44,456 --> 00:25:46,331
and I love my country.

156
00:25:47,706 --> 00:25:49,873
But why are you in this war against us?

157
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:52,289
I never wanted to go to war.
I never wanted to go to...

158
00:25:52,414 --> 00:25:56,539
I saw enough as a child.
I only wanted to fly.

159
00:26:00,956 --> 00:26:02,997
Then you should sign this.

160
00:26:03,747 --> 00:26:05,414
"Condemning the imperialistic aggression

161
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:09,372
"of the corrupt and debased political
establishment of the United States... "

162
00:26:09,497 --> 00:26:10,997
What else would you call it?

163
00:26:11,122 --> 00:26:13,706
"... against innocent children and
the peace loving working classes. "

164
00:26:13,831 --> 00:26:16,622
No, I cannot sign this.
I cannot sign it.

165
00:26:16,747 --> 00:26:19,622
If you sign this,
we would be your friends.

166
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:24,289
- You could be released in two weeks if...
- I cannot sign this.

167
00:26:25,622 --> 00:26:27,581
- It's against my...
- Your what?

168
00:26:27,706 --> 00:26:30,206
I mean, what is in here?

169
00:26:30,664 --> 00:26:32,039
What isn't here?

170
00:26:32,122 --> 00:26:36,622
I love America. America gave me wings.
I will not sign it, absolutely not.

171
00:26:37,872 --> 00:26:39,039
No way.

172
00:26:42,456 --> 00:26:43,831
Your choice.

173
00:30:01,205 --> 00:30:03,872
The quick have their sleepwalkers,

174
00:30:06,122 --> 00:30:07,914
and so do the dead.

175
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:04,372
Hey.

176
00:32:04,497 --> 00:32:07,622
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey, there. Who's that? Hello.

177
00:32:07,747 --> 00:32:09,122
Hey, you American?

178
00:32:09,247 --> 00:32:10,914
- What?
- He's American.

179
00:32:12,122 --> 00:32:15,622
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

180
00:32:15,747 --> 00:32:17,414
Yeah, I'm American.

181
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:23,289
My name is Dieter. I'm a U.S. Navy pilot.
And originally I was born in Germany...

182
00:32:23,414 --> 00:32:25,497
- Be quiet.
- ... but I am a U.S. Citizen now.

183
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,205
- Quiet.
- What?

184
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:28,789
- Who's that?
- Quiet.

185
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,914
Why? I'm whispering.

186
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,497
- Little Hitler's coming.
- Who?

187
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,705
- Little Hitler.
- Who's that?

188
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,455
Who's Little Hitler?

189
00:32:54,289 --> 00:32:55,372
Okay.

190
00:33:08,288 --> 00:33:11,205
Now, what the hell is this?
The Middle Ages?

191
00:33:15,163 --> 00:33:20,247
Hey, listen. Don't mess with
these guys. You'll regret it.

192
00:33:35,288 --> 00:33:39,038
- Hi. Dieter Dengler.
- All right, let's go. Give it over.

193
00:33:39,747 --> 00:33:41,372
Who won the World Series?

194
00:33:41,497 --> 00:33:42,955
- The World Series?
- Yeah.

195
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,997
- I don't know...
- Hey, man, the guy don't like baseball?

196
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,122
You don't like baseball?

197
00:33:46,247 --> 00:33:49,372
- No, I don't know. I don't follow baseball.
- I'm Yik Chiu Tuo.

198
00:33:49,455 --> 00:33:50,622
- Yik Chiu Tuo?
- They call me Y.C.

199
00:33:50,747 --> 00:33:52,455
- Okay, Y.C.
- Y.C.

200
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,788
Hi, I'm Dieter Dengler.

201
00:33:53,913 --> 00:33:55,705
- Dieter Dengler.
- Yeah.

202
00:33:56,705 --> 00:33:58,830
We all flew together for Air America.

203
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:03,372
Yeah, I'm world champion of bad luck.
But I tell you something, I'm undefeatable.

204
00:34:05,913 --> 00:34:06,997
Hi. Phisit.

205
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,372
- Phisit.
- My name is Phisit.

206
00:34:08,455 --> 00:34:10,455
- Dieter. Dieter.
- Yeah.

207
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,330
Procet Kam Phong Kit.

208
00:34:12,413 --> 00:34:13,747
- What?
- Procet.

209
00:34:13,872 --> 00:34:15,705
- Okay.
- Procet.

210
00:34:15,788 --> 00:34:17,122
What was that?

211
00:34:17,247 --> 00:34:18,205
- Procet.
- It's okay.

212
00:34:18,288 --> 00:34:19,288
Okay.

213
00:34:19,413 --> 00:34:23,372
- That was actually Procet... Got that?
- Right.

214
00:34:23,497 --> 00:34:25,830
- But you need to call him Procet.
- Okay, Procet.

215
00:34:25,913 --> 00:34:27,122
That's what we call him.

216
00:34:27,247 --> 00:34:28,205
He's also Air America.

217
00:34:28,288 --> 00:34:30,497
- Also got shot down flying supplies...
- Okay, okay.

218
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,663
...to royalist villages,

219
00:34:31,747 --> 00:34:33,913
- just like the rest of us.
- And when was that?

220
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:36,705
Two... No,
two and a half year ago now.

221
00:34:37,538 --> 00:34:40,122
- Two and a half years ago?
- Oh, yeah.

222
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:43,372
I had no idea that we
were here for that long.

223
00:34:43,455 --> 00:34:47,038
Yeah, been here a lot longer
than people know.

224
00:34:47,163 --> 00:34:49,372
- Duane Martin.
- Duane Martin. I'm Dieter Dengler.

225
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:52,580
United States Air Force. I was shot down
about a year and a half ago.

226
00:34:52,705 --> 00:34:54,372
- Okay.
- And when this war starts,

227
00:34:54,497 --> 00:34:56,747
we'll be here a lot longer
than we already have.

228
00:34:56,872 --> 00:34:58,622
Well, you see...

229
00:34:59,372 --> 00:35:04,205
How many more times you think
I'm gonna have to say,

230
00:35:04,413 --> 00:35:09,122
like I been saying and saying
and saying and saying again,

231
00:35:09,247 --> 00:35:12,288
that we will never go
to war in Vietnam, man?

232
00:35:12,413 --> 00:35:13,663
- No, they just...
- They, no...

233
00:35:13,747 --> 00:35:16,497
Because any day now... Listen.
They will what?

234
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,538
- Yeah, Christmas come every day.
- They...

235
00:35:18,622 --> 00:35:19,663
They will release us, man.

236
00:35:20,872 --> 00:35:24,247
They will let us go any day now.

237
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,247
- No, you see...
- Gene, by the way.

238
00:35:26,372 --> 00:35:28,038
- Gene.
- But listen.

239
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,830
It's... The trick to it is
it's actually Eugene.

240
00:35:31,913 --> 00:35:35,038
- Okay, Eugene.
- Eugene DeBruin from

241
00:35:35,163 --> 00:35:37,663
- Eugene, Oregon.
- Okay.

242
00:35:37,788 --> 00:35:39,747
- How do you like that?
- Yeah.

243
00:35:39,872 --> 00:35:42,330
See how that works out?
Name, name...

244
00:35:42,413 --> 00:35:44,580
Jesus Christ,
not this Oregon shit, again.

245
00:35:44,705 --> 00:35:47,372
I've heard this over 2,000 goddamn times.

246
00:35:47,497 --> 00:35:49,705
- Eugene from Eugene.
- Oh, yeah, right. Eugene from Eugene.

247
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:51,247
- You know what? You know what? Listen.
- Yeah.

248
00:35:51,372 --> 00:35:55,205
What you really need to know is
you see this man here?

249
00:35:55,288 --> 00:35:57,497
Take a good look at him.
He, he...

250
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:03,997
Listen now, he shits in his pants
every night without fail, man.

251
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,330
Trust me.

252
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,955
And you know the only thing that he
thinks is worth complaining about?

253
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,997
You know what that is?

254
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,205
- This man right here.
- Right.

255
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,663
- Eugene from Eugene.
- From Eugene.

256
00:36:16,247 --> 00:36:17,247
Okay.

257
00:36:22,288 --> 00:36:23,455
Dieter.

258
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,330
Take a careful look to your right.
You see that guy there?

259
00:36:26,413 --> 00:36:29,413
We call him Little Hitler
for a very good reason.

260
00:36:29,538 --> 00:36:31,080
He is the worst.

261
00:36:31,205 --> 00:36:34,163
This one we call Jumbo.

262
00:36:34,246 --> 00:36:35,830
Oh, wow.

263
00:36:35,955 --> 00:36:37,746
That's the first smile I've seen
since I was shot down.

264
00:36:37,871 --> 00:36:40,538
Yeah. He's, in fact,
one of the only truly nice guys here.

265
00:36:40,621 --> 00:36:45,330
This is Nook the Rook right here.
He's also very much not a nice guy.

266
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:51,038
- What is his problem?
- It's all right. Just keep going.

267
00:36:51,163 --> 00:36:53,788
His problem is he's Crazy Horse.
That's what we call him.

268
00:36:53,913 --> 00:36:58,496
And he is a bastard. Keep going.
And I just cannot stand him.

269
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,871
- That's Walkie Talkie.
- Walkie Talkie?

270
00:37:00,955 --> 00:37:04,538
We call him that 'cause he does not speak.
Never, never.

271
00:37:05,705 --> 00:37:09,163
Hey, do yourself a favor, Kraut.

272
00:37:09,288 --> 00:37:10,788
Keep your head down
and your mouth shut.

273
00:37:10,913 --> 00:37:13,455
That's your best chance of surviving.

274
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,246
So there is a war.

275
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,330
There is a war.

276
00:37:55,413 --> 00:37:58,496
All right. So tell me about
the peace talks, man. Geneva?

277
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,038
There's got to be peace talks, man.

278
00:38:01,121 --> 00:38:04,038
Shut up, Gene.
There is no goddamn conference.

279
00:38:04,121 --> 00:38:05,205
When are you gonna get
that through your skull?

280
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:08,121
Secret talks, man.
I'm just talking about secret talks.

281
00:38:08,246 --> 00:38:09,538
Forget it.

282
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:10,871
We're not getting out.

283
00:38:10,996 --> 00:38:13,205
No, no, no, there was a honcho
on the outside,

284
00:38:13,288 --> 00:38:15,455
he said I would not be here too long.

285
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,371
They tell that to everyone
to get them to sign.

286
00:38:17,455 --> 00:38:20,205
No, I did not sign. No.

287
00:38:22,288 --> 00:38:26,371
Anyway, nice having met you.

288
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,705
What do you mean, met?

289
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:32,371
Well, my friends,
you can rot in here if you like,

290
00:38:33,496 --> 00:38:36,496
but I'm gonna scram this very night.

291
00:38:37,663 --> 00:38:39,996
This hut,
it ain't no prison.

292
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,996
Scram. I like that.
I like that.

293
00:38:46,121 --> 00:38:50,080
Listen, listen, my friend,
you cannot escape.

294
00:38:50,163 --> 00:38:53,538
If you try to escape,
you'll screw up our release.

295
00:38:53,663 --> 00:38:58,205
Look, I don't give a shit about our release
or whatever you think is gonna happen.

296
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:03,538
But without water, you won't survive
more than two days out there.

297
00:39:03,663 --> 00:39:07,455
And without water,
your tracks will be visible for even more.

298
00:39:08,496 --> 00:39:11,538
The jungle is the prison.
Don't you get it?

299
00:39:14,288 --> 00:39:18,496
Hey, when does the rainy season start?

300
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,455
Five months, maybe six.

301
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,496
I can't wait that long.

302
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:28,746
Hey, listen, let's say you do survive
the jungle and lack of water,

303
00:39:28,871 --> 00:39:32,746
whatever you find, snakes and animals
and shit are out there,

304
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,705
you won't make it out of camp.

305
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,538
There's six guards posted during the day.

306
00:39:39,955 --> 00:39:40,996
Yeah.

307
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,580
That is during the day.

308
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,246
I'm going at night.

309
00:39:56,121 --> 00:39:57,788
Why, what happens at night?

310
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,080
No.

311
00:40:01,038 --> 00:40:01,996
No.

312
00:40:02,538 --> 00:40:03,496
No.

313
00:40:07,163 --> 00:40:09,371
I'm shitting my intestines out.

314
00:40:12,163 --> 00:40:13,496
Again.

315
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:15,704
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

316
00:40:17,163 --> 00:40:21,038
You just shit right on my hand again, man.

317
00:40:21,163 --> 00:40:26,121
- Sorry.
- That makes it 2,207 times and counting.

318
00:40:26,246 --> 00:40:27,954
Leave the guy alone, okay?

319
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,246
There ain't no alone, brother.

320
00:40:30,746 --> 00:40:32,829
Does anybody have a nail?

321
00:40:32,913 --> 00:40:34,704
What are you gonna do with a nail?

322
00:40:34,788 --> 00:40:37,621
You're gonna stab all the lousy guards
to death with a nail?

323
00:40:37,746 --> 00:40:40,079
What kind of plane you fly off of?

324
00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:43,829
- Procet has got a shard of glass, man.
- No, that's no good.

325
00:40:43,913 --> 00:40:45,121
I have porcupine needle.

326
00:40:45,246 --> 00:40:46,454
No.

327
00:40:47,454 --> 00:40:50,913
I've got a hammer and a socket wrench
stuffed up my ass.

328
00:40:54,246 --> 00:40:55,788
There's no nails.

329
00:40:55,913 --> 00:40:58,121
This whole prison's made
of bamboo and rattan.

330
00:40:58,246 --> 00:40:59,413
Damn it.

331
00:41:03,371 --> 00:41:05,454
I know where there's a nail.

332
00:41:19,121 --> 00:41:20,204
Okay.

333
00:41:21,538 --> 00:41:23,371
I'm gonna make my move.

334
00:41:24,704 --> 00:41:27,371
So all of you scatter in
all directions, okay? Go.

335
00:41:27,454 --> 00:41:28,663
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

336
00:41:28,746 --> 00:41:33,538
What makes you think you're not crazy
for thinking that'll work, man?

337
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:36,038
Eugene's right.
It'll attract too much attention.

338
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:39,454
Oh, for God's sake,
that's what I want.

339
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:40,871
Please.

340
00:41:41,621 --> 00:41:43,954
You trust me? Please.

341
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,204
Duane, head to the outhouse.

342
00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:49,704
Y.C., go to the top right.
Okay?

343
00:41:49,829 --> 00:41:52,538
Gene, please come on.
No, no, no.

344
00:41:52,621 --> 00:41:56,996
Gene, Phisit, Procet,
head towards the gate.

345
00:41:57,079 --> 00:41:59,038
Move as fast as you can.

346
00:41:59,746 --> 00:42:03,329
Get their attention, that's what I need.
Go, go, go, go. Go, go.

347
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:19,913
Hey, Jumbo, Jumbo.
Hey, no, no, no.

348
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:24,496
Can I borrow some of the toothpaste?
Let me get some of that. That's good.

349
00:42:25,746 --> 00:42:28,871
I felt so like having a good smile,
you know?

350
00:42:28,954 --> 00:42:31,163
Like you have.
You got a good smile, too.

351
00:42:33,163 --> 00:42:34,371
Okay.

352
00:42:40,746 --> 00:42:44,204
Y.C., when I hit it,
you make a noise.

353
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:46,038
Cough or something.

354
00:43:14,788 --> 00:43:16,079
I love it.

355
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:19,704
I love it.

356
00:43:20,788 --> 00:43:23,038
I love it.

357
00:43:23,329 --> 00:43:27,163
I love it. I love it.

358
00:43:57,996 --> 00:43:59,704
Give me some slack.

359
00:44:00,662 --> 00:44:01,912
Let's see.

360
00:44:02,037 --> 00:44:05,496
Oh, God. Oh, God,
that was an easy one.

361
00:44:08,496 --> 00:44:14,454
You see, I apprenticed as a
tool and die maker in Germany.

362
00:44:16,829 --> 00:44:22,037
There was no aviation at the time
and I wanted to learn something useful

363
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:23,912
that would help me repair planes.

364
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:28,829
And, boy, are those years coming in handy
in unexpected ways now.

365
00:44:28,912 --> 00:44:31,329
There's only one brand
that I cannot handle,

366
00:44:31,412 --> 00:44:32,871
that is Smith and Wesson.

367
00:44:37,496 --> 00:44:42,954
I think with practice, I can open these up
in maybe two, three seconds flat.

368
00:44:46,246 --> 00:44:52,371
But listen, everybody keep one cuff
on a wrist at all times,

369
00:44:53,412 --> 00:44:57,329
so that if the guards come checking,
we can put them on again quickly.

370
00:44:57,412 --> 00:45:00,704
No, they don't check us at night.
They think we can't get out of these.

371
00:45:00,787 --> 00:45:02,704
They think it's impossible.

372
00:45:02,912 --> 00:45:04,912
Show me how you did that.

373
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,996
It's so simple. Okay.

374
00:45:09,704 --> 00:45:12,912
All you do,
insert the nail.

375
00:45:13,537 --> 00:45:16,579
There's a cuff and a spring.
They both have teeth.

376
00:45:16,704 --> 00:45:21,162
You push down on the spring,
disengage the teeth like that.

377
00:45:21,246 --> 00:45:24,454
You see?
This is what happens inside.

378
00:45:26,287 --> 00:45:28,621
- And the cuffs release.
- Wow.

379
00:45:29,954 --> 00:45:30,996
Hands free.

380
00:45:50,496 --> 00:45:51,704
Get away.

381
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:55,162
Get away.

382
00:45:55,246 --> 00:45:59,204
No, no, no, no, no. Let him.
He's our friend, Malay.

383
00:45:59,287 --> 00:46:02,204
Let him do it. It's the best way
to heal sores around here.

384
00:46:02,287 --> 00:46:03,496
Okay.

385
00:46:03,912 --> 00:46:05,162
Hey,

386
00:46:06,246 --> 00:46:09,079
that cuff thing,
that's good, real good.

387
00:46:09,204 --> 00:46:11,246
Yeah. Thanks.

388
00:46:12,579 --> 00:46:13,912
Hey, Duane,

389
00:46:15,746 --> 00:46:18,746
do you know where we are?
I mean, you have any idea?

390
00:46:18,871 --> 00:46:22,912
No. But my guess is that
this here's still Laos.

391
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:25,579
And the guards, they're...

392
00:46:25,662 --> 00:46:26,704
- Laotian.
- ... Laotian?

393
00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:28,537
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but the camp is Vietcong,

394
00:46:28,662 --> 00:46:30,246
there's no question.

395
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:32,787
Look, I know what you're thinking,

396
00:46:33,996 --> 00:46:36,912
but jungles on these mountains
is a nightmare.

397
00:46:39,371 --> 00:46:41,746
Besides, you'd end up in Vietnam.

398
00:46:41,871 --> 00:46:44,496
- No, but if we can get to Thailand...
- Yeah.

399
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:46,204
If we can make it to the Mekong River...

400
00:46:46,329 --> 00:46:48,329
Yeah, the Big Muddy.
If you could, you would, right?

401
00:46:48,454 --> 00:46:49,871
Yeah. We can.

402
00:46:50,871 --> 00:46:53,579
- Hey, why not? We can.
- Yeah.

403
00:46:53,704 --> 00:46:56,204
Just stop talking about it.
Okay?

404
00:46:56,329 --> 00:46:58,287
Just quiet. Excuse me.

405
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,787
- Hey, Gene.
- Yeah.

406
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,454
Which of you guys knows most
about the country?

407
00:47:09,579 --> 00:47:14,079
Oh, that would be Phisit,
but he doesn't talk to us.

408
00:47:14,412 --> 00:47:15,954
What do you mean?

409
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,829
You see,
Phisit is pissed about...

410
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:20,870
About...

411
00:47:25,245 --> 00:47:26,579
He's pissed about something.

412
00:47:26,704 --> 00:47:30,954
We don't even remember
what he's pissed about.

413
00:47:50,704 --> 00:47:51,704
Hey!

414
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:53,412
Hey!

415
00:47:54,495 --> 00:47:56,370
Hey, come back!

416
00:47:58,370 --> 00:47:59,954
Hey!

417
00:48:02,204 --> 00:48:04,204
I can't believe that bastard shot you.

418
00:48:04,329 --> 00:48:07,245
I know. I didn't even pull down
my flight suit.

419
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:09,704
Hey, look, when I was standing
it looked like...

420
00:48:11,829 --> 00:48:13,995
We're gonna get even one day.

421
00:48:21,954 --> 00:48:23,079
Howdy.

422
00:48:31,912 --> 00:48:33,412
Americali.

423
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:40,204
- Americali.
- Americali. Americali. Americali.

424
00:49:02,495 --> 00:49:05,079
Two years ago a parcel came through.

425
00:49:07,745 --> 00:49:08,787
Yeah.

426
00:49:09,704 --> 00:49:12,454
He puts it on display on really bad days.

427
00:49:14,412 --> 00:49:17,704
The bacon label still looks greasy.

428
00:49:18,579 --> 00:49:20,454
Does it still have a scent on it?

429
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:21,912
Oh, you bet.

430
00:49:23,954 --> 00:49:25,412
Can I get a sniff?

431
00:49:25,537 --> 00:49:27,204
Oh, no, you may not.

432
00:49:28,287 --> 00:49:30,787
You may not.
That is my sniff.

433
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:33,995
Man, that is my sniff.

434
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:48,620
Hey.

435
00:49:50,204 --> 00:49:52,370
How'd you ever end up a pilot?

436
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,704
I always...
I always wanted to be one.

437
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,037
I was

438
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:04,745
five years old, or something, in a little
town, Wildberg, in the Black Forest,

439
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:08,204
and it was just bombed to ashes,
you know?

440
00:50:08,287 --> 00:50:11,162
No clear reason,
just these senseless attacks.

441
00:50:12,579 --> 00:50:17,495
But I remember I was in the attic
with my brother.

442
00:50:19,245 --> 00:50:20,995
We were looking out,

443
00:50:21,745 --> 00:50:24,995
and we see this fighter plane,

444
00:50:25,579 --> 00:50:29,079
beautiful, coming right at us.

445
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:31,953
And it's firing from its wings,

446
00:50:32,078 --> 00:50:36,203
and I see the machine gun,
it's flashing and it

447
00:50:38,662 --> 00:50:40,162
Goes flying past the house.

448
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:45,328
It's so close. I mean,
it's feet away from the house.

449
00:50:47,203 --> 00:50:50,120
And the canopy was open.

450
00:50:51,828 --> 00:50:57,245
And this pilot,
he had his goggles up on his helmet.

451
00:50:58,578 --> 00:51:00,537
And I could see his eyes.

452
00:51:01,495 --> 00:51:03,578
And he was looking at me.

453
00:51:04,495 --> 00:51:05,787
Right at me.

454
00:51:05,912 --> 00:51:07,578
He's looking right at me.

455
00:51:07,703 --> 00:51:11,162
And as he turns to go, he's starting back,
he's looking right at me still.

456
00:51:11,245 --> 00:51:12,953
And the thing is,

457
00:51:13,745 --> 00:51:17,287
from that moment on,
little Dieter,

458
00:51:18,495 --> 00:51:20,370
he needed to fly.

459
00:51:23,537 --> 00:51:25,703
You're a strange bird, Dieter.

460
00:51:26,287 --> 00:51:29,203
Guy tries to kill you
and you want his job.

461
00:51:33,703 --> 00:51:35,078
Yeah.

462
00:52:05,828 --> 00:52:07,745
God, we need the rain.

463
00:52:08,828 --> 00:52:11,203
We need the rain to come quicker.

464
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:20,120
See, here's what I can see,
you still need to understand.

465
00:52:20,245 --> 00:52:23,745
- No, I understand.
- You wanna talk about the rain again, we...

466
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:25,745
Listen, now. Listen.

467
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:30,703
We will be released by
the time the rain comes

468
00:52:30,828 --> 00:52:32,453
like I have told you before...

469
00:52:32,578 --> 00:52:35,912
- Stop telling me.
- I don't wanna have to keep telling you.

470
00:52:36,037 --> 00:52:38,953
- Then stop telling me.
- They will release us.

471
00:52:39,078 --> 00:52:40,203
You understand?

472
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:42,037
And here's what I'm starting to think,

473
00:52:42,162 --> 00:52:45,162
that maybe you're trying
not to understand.

474
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:49,328
If you try and escape, we,

475
00:52:50,078 --> 00:52:53,078
we will be killed,
we who you leave behind.

476
00:52:53,162 --> 00:52:55,828
- It's not just me, we all try to escape.
- Taking off. We who have been here

477
00:52:55,912 --> 00:52:57,870
for two years.

478
00:52:57,953 --> 00:52:59,787
Two years before you showed up.

479
00:52:59,912 --> 00:53:02,495
I don't want to escape alone.
We escape together.

480
00:53:02,578 --> 00:53:05,453
Wait, wait.
Why would the guards spend all this time

481
00:53:05,578 --> 00:53:08,370
cutting bamboo and wood
to build a watchtower

482
00:53:08,453 --> 00:53:10,162
if we weren't meant
to be here for a while?

483
00:53:10,245 --> 00:53:11,245
- Exactly.
- Two years.

484
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:13,412
- Exactly. Why would they do that if they...
- Listen. Listen to me.

485
00:53:13,537 --> 00:53:16,495
- ... didn't plan to hold us a long time?
- Listen. Here's what it all comes down to.

486
00:53:16,578 --> 00:53:20,912
I am not,
I'm not gonna let you do that.

487
00:53:21,037 --> 00:53:22,203
No, no, no.

488
00:53:22,328 --> 00:53:23,995
You know what I am gonna do?

489
00:53:24,078 --> 00:53:25,703
I am gonna scream.

490
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:29,495
That's right. I think
I'm gonna scream my head off.

491
00:53:35,453 --> 00:53:39,495
'Cause see,
I would much rather they shoot you,

492
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:43,162
than me, or any of us.
You understand?

493
00:53:45,537 --> 00:53:46,495
Yeah.

494
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:48,787
You understand?

495
00:53:48,912 --> 00:53:50,037
Yeah.

496
00:53:51,703 --> 00:53:53,370
You've been warned.

497
00:53:54,453 --> 00:53:55,787
Haven't you?

498
00:55:03,286 --> 00:55:05,578
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

499
00:55:06,745 --> 00:55:08,536
This is for shaving.

500
00:55:10,078 --> 00:55:11,370
Howdy.

501
00:55:22,995 --> 00:55:25,995
- Man, I can't get over it.
- What, this?

502
00:55:26,078 --> 00:55:28,203
No, that girl, you know?

503
00:55:28,328 --> 00:55:29,911
She smiled at me.

504
00:55:30,495 --> 00:55:32,703
And when she smiled,

505
00:55:34,036 --> 00:55:37,745
man, did I wish there was no war.

506
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:38,828
Really.

507
00:55:38,953 --> 00:55:41,786
- I thought you were engaged.
- Oh, yeah, I am.

508
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:43,703
We got engaged the day before I left.

509
00:55:43,786 --> 00:55:48,286
Marina, she is a wonderful girl.
So smart, you know?

510
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:50,620
She studies marine biology.

511
00:55:50,745 --> 00:55:53,328
But I hope that she's waiting for me.

512
00:55:56,203 --> 00:55:58,661
- I'm sure she is.
- Yeah, well, she said she would,

513
00:55:58,745 --> 00:56:01,203
but, you know, women can be funny
and go looking for another man...

514
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:19,536
Duane, you okay?

515
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,370
- Yeah.
- Y. C?

516
00:56:21,453 --> 00:56:22,411
Yik Chiu Tuo, okay.

517
00:56:22,536 --> 00:56:24,286
Okay. Gene?

518
00:56:24,411 --> 00:56:25,828
Phisit? Procet?

519
00:56:25,911 --> 00:56:26,995
Yeah.

520
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:56,995
Happy birthday to you.

521
00:56:58,536 --> 00:57:02,203
Happy birthday to you.

522
00:57:03,828 --> 00:57:06,703
Happy birthday, dear Dieter.

523
00:57:07,245 --> 00:57:10,120
Happy birthday to you.

524
00:57:10,745 --> 00:57:12,495
It is May the 22nd?

525
00:57:13,036 --> 00:57:14,245
Happy birthday.

526
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:16,286
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday, Dieter.

527
00:57:16,411 --> 00:57:18,661
What kind of champagne is this?

528
00:57:18,745 --> 00:57:21,328
You just got to keep thinking protein,
lots of protein.

529
00:57:21,411 --> 00:57:22,870
It's not bad.

530
00:57:23,286 --> 00:57:25,328
Squished insect larva.

531
00:57:27,495 --> 00:57:28,703
Protein.

532
00:57:29,411 --> 00:57:30,369
Mmm.

533
00:57:31,911 --> 00:57:34,369
Oh, this is a good year,
this one.

534
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:36,453
Yeah, my favorite.

535
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,119
So, listen, guys.

536
00:57:38,578 --> 00:57:40,203
Thank you so much.

537
00:57:40,328 --> 00:57:42,203
And it is my birthday, yes,

538
00:57:42,286 --> 00:57:45,369
but I would like to
give you some presents.

539
00:57:45,494 --> 00:57:47,828
Okay. Now, look.

540
00:57:48,536 --> 00:57:53,994
I have taken these cartridge shells
and I have made a knife of each one.

541
00:57:55,036 --> 00:57:56,328
Okay.

542
00:57:56,411 --> 00:58:01,119
Now, I'm sorry, but I have to keep one
for myself. Okay?

543
00:58:01,703 --> 00:58:03,411
Duane, you're first.

544
00:58:04,078 --> 00:58:05,203
Right.

545
00:58:07,994 --> 00:58:09,161
Phisit.

546
00:58:09,703 --> 00:58:11,161
Left or right?

547
00:58:13,328 --> 00:58:14,453
Y.C.

548
00:58:16,203 --> 00:58:17,744
Easy money, pal.

549
00:58:20,244 --> 00:58:21,286
Gene.

550
00:58:24,494 --> 00:58:28,328
- Procet, it is yours. Okay.
- I don't care about the knife.

551
00:58:28,411 --> 00:58:29,453
This is for Crazy Horse.

552
00:58:29,578 --> 00:58:32,286
No, no, no.
Crazy Horse is mine.

553
00:58:32,411 --> 00:58:35,328
My Crazy Horse. Mine.

554
00:58:36,286 --> 00:58:40,828
Now listen, we must collect the rice
and hide it.

555
00:58:41,578 --> 00:58:45,036
But we must dry it because it rots
too quickly if we don't dry it, okay?

556
00:58:45,161 --> 00:58:47,203
What? Hide it?
You wanna hide it?

557
00:58:47,328 --> 00:58:48,619
- Yeah, yeah.
- We can eat it now.

558
00:58:48,744 --> 00:58:49,953
- No, no.
- We eat it now.

559
00:58:50,036 --> 00:58:54,036
Look, look, look, I've created a
secret compartment here for the rice.

560
00:58:54,161 --> 00:58:58,244
It is at the bottom of my crap container.

561
00:58:58,411 --> 00:58:59,578
So I don't think the guards

562
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:01,911
- are gonna want to check that.
- Crazy. This is...

563
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,661
Why are you hiding it now?

564
00:59:04,744 --> 00:59:06,244
For our escape.

565
00:59:09,911 --> 00:59:11,494
You have a plan.

566
00:59:11,911 --> 00:59:12,953
Yes.

567
00:59:13,744 --> 00:59:16,536
Now, have you noticed

568
00:59:16,661 --> 00:59:19,744
that the guards when they are called
to the kitchen hut for chow time,

569
00:59:19,869 --> 00:59:21,828
they always leave
their rifles behind, always?

570
00:59:21,911 --> 00:59:26,078
So we have a few minutes
before they return for their rifles.

571
00:59:26,203 --> 00:59:29,078
We go out through the hut,
we grab their guns,

572
00:59:29,203 --> 00:59:30,369
- we surprise them.
- No.

573
00:59:30,494 --> 00:59:33,369
- And we surprise... We surprise them...
- Crazy.

574
00:59:33,453 --> 00:59:35,078
...and we surround them, okay?

575
00:59:35,203 --> 00:59:39,119
Then we take the guards as prisoners.

576
00:59:39,203 --> 00:59:42,036
We take over the camp.
Think about it, okay?

577
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:46,161
We hold it down for a few days
until we can signal our aircraft

578
00:59:47,619 --> 00:59:49,078
to pick us up.

579
01:00:11,286 --> 01:00:12,703
- Dieter, quick.
- Okay.

580
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:17,161
They'll call mess any second.

581
01:00:18,869 --> 01:00:20,369
Quick, quick.

582
01:00:53,619 --> 01:00:57,453
- Who's in the kitchen?
- I see four.

583
01:00:57,578 --> 01:01:01,744
The cook, Little Hitler and Nook the Rook
and somebody I've never seen before.

584
01:01:01,869 --> 01:01:03,828
He looks like a villager.

585
01:01:03,953 --> 01:01:06,203
- What about the rifles?
- Okay, rifles.

586
01:01:06,286 --> 01:01:11,328
Little Hitler's rifle and
Nook's rifle in Hut A.

587
01:01:11,411 --> 01:01:15,869
And, okay, Crazy Horse
going towards Hut B

588
01:01:15,994 --> 01:01:18,577
with his submachine gun.
Okay.

589
01:01:18,952 --> 01:01:20,786
There's somebody else
coming up over the hillside.

590
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:22,286
- Who?
- I can't make him out,

591
01:01:22,411 --> 01:01:24,369
but he has a machete.
Okay.

592
01:01:24,452 --> 01:01:25,869
Oh, shit.

593
01:01:25,994 --> 01:01:27,869
Nook the Rook is coming back
with his food.

594
01:01:27,994 --> 01:01:29,327
Quick. Quick.

595
01:01:32,994 --> 01:01:36,036
Hooks in now. Hide the nail.
Hide the nail.

596
01:01:36,161 --> 01:01:37,536
- Got it?
- Yeah.

597
01:01:37,661 --> 01:01:39,327
Okay. Okay.

598
01:01:43,536 --> 01:01:44,744
Close it.

599
01:02:12,869 --> 01:02:16,619
Nice, because we all happen to be...

600
01:02:16,744 --> 01:02:19,911
Hungry

601
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:22,536
Hungry

602
01:02:22,744 --> 01:02:24,869
Hungry

603
01:02:24,994 --> 01:02:27,702
Hungry

604
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:28,911
- Hey, Duane.
- What?

605
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:30,619
Okay. Your turn.

606
01:02:30,744 --> 01:02:32,286
- What, my turn?
- Yeah.

607
01:02:32,411 --> 01:02:34,869
- Stack it up.
- Oh, all right. You ready?

608
01:02:35,911 --> 01:02:38,369
- Bottom shelf, raspberry pie.
- Okay.

609
01:02:38,452 --> 01:02:41,702
The way my mom makes it
with the crust as thick as a steak.

610
01:02:41,827 --> 01:02:44,494
- Yeah.
- And on top shelf is a turkey.

611
01:02:44,577 --> 01:02:46,036
I'm not talking Thanksgiving big.

612
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:50,827
I'm talking, you know, an obscene,
enormous, like, 35-pound turkey

613
01:02:50,911 --> 01:02:54,077
with breasts the size of Jayne Mansfield's.
You know what I mean?

614
01:02:55,494 --> 01:02:58,536
You've got gravy, stuffing,
six-pack of Budweiser...

615
01:02:58,661 --> 01:02:59,869
No, no, no, no.

616
01:02:59,952 --> 01:03:03,619
No, I prefer the Bavarian stein.
You know?

617
01:03:03,744 --> 01:03:07,286
With a quarter of a gallon
and it's dark and it's cool

618
01:03:07,411 --> 01:03:10,119
and you get the foam lapping up

619
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:12,161
- and coming over the side.
- Yeah. Okay.

620
01:03:12,244 --> 01:03:15,536
- It's so cool you get the mist on the side...
- All right, that's in your fridge.

621
01:03:15,619 --> 01:03:18,119
- This is my fridge. Right?
- Okay.

622
01:03:18,244 --> 01:03:20,036
- I'm sorry. Go ahead.
- Six-pack stays where it is.

623
01:03:20,161 --> 01:03:21,661
Yeah. It's okay.

624
01:03:21,744 --> 01:03:22,994
- Muffins.
- Okay.

625
01:03:23,077 --> 01:03:26,077
- Yeah.
- Okay, oranges, couple of dozen eggs.

626
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:31,577
- All right.
- And, oh, a pile... A huge pile of pancakes

627
01:03:31,702 --> 01:03:36,661
- with tons of syrup, I mean, just soaked.
- Why always the sweet stuff?

628
01:03:36,744 --> 01:03:38,202
- Okay. Go ahead.
- Why always the sweet stuff?

629
01:03:38,327 --> 01:03:39,577
- You stack the fridge. Go ahead.
- Okay.

630
01:03:39,702 --> 01:03:42,911
- It's my turn.
- Noodles and Spam, okay.

631
01:03:43,036 --> 01:03:44,952
No, okay. Sorry.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

632
01:03:45,077 --> 01:03:47,077
- It's your turn. You go.
- Right.

633
01:03:47,702 --> 01:03:49,244
- Some cake.
- Yeah.

634
01:03:49,369 --> 01:03:51,036
See, you ruined it.

635
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,369
Why you always got to interrupt me?

636
01:03:54,577 --> 01:03:55,702
God.

637
01:03:58,786 --> 01:04:02,036
Okay, rifle one and rifle two
in Hut A.

638
01:04:03,077 --> 01:04:06,869
Submachine gun in Hut B
and another rifle in Hut C.

639
01:04:06,952 --> 01:04:09,369
- That's new. Are you sure?
- Affirmative.

640
01:04:09,869 --> 01:04:13,244
And in the kitchen
we have Nook the Rook,

641
01:04:13,369 --> 01:04:15,702
Crazy Horse and Jumbo arriving.

642
01:04:19,452 --> 01:04:20,869
Jumbo's gun?

643
01:04:21,452 --> 01:04:22,994
- Jumbo's gun?
- Duane.

644
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:25,827
- What?
- Duane.

645
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:35,036
It's just a game.

646
01:04:36,411 --> 01:04:38,036
It's just a game.

647
01:04:40,869 --> 01:04:42,077
I won.

648
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,035
Phisit.

649
01:05:17,744 --> 01:05:19,369
Hold this side up.

650
01:06:25,077 --> 01:06:26,285
Come on.

651
01:06:51,619 --> 01:06:53,077
Do you see it?

652
01:06:56,994 --> 01:06:57,994
No.

653
01:07:00,785 --> 01:07:02,827
- I see it.
- Yeah, that's because you dug it.

654
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:05,077
You did a good job, trust me.

655
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:21,535
I've seen clouds, okay?

656
01:07:22,244 --> 01:07:24,327
When does the monsoon start?

657
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:25,660
I don't know.

658
01:07:25,744 --> 01:07:27,535
Could be another two weeks.

659
01:07:27,619 --> 01:07:29,119
- No, no, no, no.
- Or a month.

660
01:07:29,244 --> 01:07:30,452
No, no, no, no, no.

661
01:07:30,577 --> 01:07:32,577
- Maybe five days.
- Okay. No.

662
01:07:32,702 --> 01:07:35,160
We need to set a start date

663
01:07:35,285 --> 01:07:40,077
because the guards, you know,
they are starving as well.

664
01:07:40,202 --> 01:07:43,660
And they are getting
meaner and meaner, so...

665
01:07:43,744 --> 01:07:47,494
I don't care about anything else.
Your plan, I don't care.

666
01:07:47,577 --> 01:07:49,410
- You can stay behind...
- Listen to me.

667
01:07:49,535 --> 01:07:51,785
- ... if you want.
- Listen to me now.

668
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:53,577
- How about that?
- Listen...

669
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:56,327
Dieter, I'm on board.

670
01:07:56,827 --> 01:07:59,202
I'd rather be dead out there
than rotting away in here.

671
01:07:59,285 --> 01:08:00,535
Okay, buddy. Okay.

672
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,535
Y.C., are you on board?

673
01:08:05,577 --> 01:08:06,910
I guess so.

674
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:10,035
- Okay. Procet?
- I am out.

675
01:08:10,577 --> 01:08:14,244
- You are out of the plan?
- I am. No, no, I want to get out.

676
01:08:14,369 --> 01:08:17,368
You're coming with us out.
Great. Okay, Phisit?

677
01:08:22,035 --> 01:08:24,577
That's a yes. So...

678
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:26,702
So,

679
01:08:27,827 --> 01:08:29,327
it is settled then.

680
01:08:30,243 --> 01:08:31,285
Okay.

681
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:34,535
July the 4th.

682
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:36,827
July the 4th.

683
01:08:37,243 --> 01:08:38,743
No matter what.

684
01:08:41,077 --> 01:08:42,368
Okay.

685
01:09:28,452 --> 01:09:31,702
We had this two years ago
when it was really bad.

686
01:09:31,827 --> 01:09:34,827
- How can it get any worse?
- Really bad.

687
01:09:34,952 --> 01:09:37,993
You don't ask, you just eat.

688
01:09:38,118 --> 01:09:43,702
You just smile, smile and eat.
Duane, Duane, Duane.

689
01:09:43,827 --> 01:09:44,827
- Come on.
- No.

690
01:09:44,952 --> 01:09:47,285
You got to try.
It's protein.

691
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:49,493
Protein's not gonna kill you.

692
01:09:49,577 --> 01:09:50,827
Just try.

693
01:09:51,535 --> 01:09:52,535
Hey.

694
01:10:03,743 --> 01:10:08,368
I am going to eat my rice.

695
01:10:08,452 --> 01:10:10,577
- I'm gonna eat my rice.
- No, you are not.

696
01:10:10,702 --> 01:10:12,868
I'm gonna eat that rice.

697
01:10:13,577 --> 01:10:16,702
I'm gonna eat that rice
because it is my rice.

698
01:10:16,785 --> 01:10:20,077
- You are not.
- I will eat my rice.

699
01:10:20,202 --> 01:10:21,618
We're not gonna eat that rice.

700
01:10:21,743 --> 01:10:23,077
My rice.

701
01:10:23,202 --> 01:10:25,868
That is not your rice.
That is our rice.

702
01:10:25,952 --> 01:10:26,993
- Okay.
- Oh, I see.

703
01:10:27,077 --> 01:10:28,827
And I tell you what.

704
01:10:29,743 --> 01:10:33,660
I'm not gonna let you out of
your handcuffs tonight, okay?

705
01:10:33,743 --> 01:10:36,368
Because I still have the key.

706
01:10:43,493 --> 01:10:45,827
Oh, I see. I see.

707
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:48,202
Let me see if I have this right.

708
01:10:49,077 --> 01:10:50,993
You're the warden himself now.

709
01:10:51,077 --> 01:10:54,285
Is that right? Is that right?
Do I have that right?

710
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:00,660
Okay?

711
01:11:09,452 --> 01:11:10,993
- Dieter.
- No.

712
01:11:16,452 --> 01:11:17,827
- Dieter.
- No.

713
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:25,493
Oh, God.

714
01:11:26,202 --> 01:11:28,368
Come on, Dieter,
open the cuffs.

715
01:11:28,452 --> 01:11:29,535
No.

716
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:34,160
You, you are on my list
right after Crazy Horse.

717
01:11:34,243 --> 01:11:35,493
Cut that crap, you know?

718
01:11:35,577 --> 01:11:38,202
Because I will do you in two seconds flat.

719
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:41,368
- Okay.
- Hey, hey, hey. You are on my list.

720
01:11:41,493 --> 01:11:43,910
On my list.

721
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:47,285
That's right.

722
01:11:58,285 --> 01:11:59,493
No food.

723
01:12:00,118 --> 01:12:02,368
Go away,
there's no food today.

724
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:04,118
No food.

725
01:12:11,826 --> 01:12:13,035
Dieter.

726
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,535
- You should apologize.
- Okay.

727
01:12:15,618 --> 01:12:17,326
I was just making a point.

728
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:19,076
You should apologize to Gene.

729
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:23,660
You are not gonna keep me prisoner.
I said you are not gonna keep me prisoner.

730
01:12:23,785 --> 01:12:25,826
Oh, and you are not the one
that I'm afraid of, okay,

731
01:12:25,951 --> 01:12:28,410
because the man who will frighten me
has to be born yet.

732
01:12:28,535 --> 01:12:30,618
- Come on, apologize.
- Okay?

733
01:12:32,993 --> 01:12:33,993
Okay.

734
01:12:34,076 --> 01:12:36,368
Gene, I apologize.

735
01:12:38,576 --> 01:12:39,951
Gene.

736
01:12:45,076 --> 01:12:46,160
Gene.

737
01:12:47,201 --> 01:12:49,701
Hey, I'm really sorry.

738
01:12:54,701 --> 01:12:55,743
Okay?

739
01:13:00,285 --> 01:13:01,576
I'm sorry.

740
01:13:02,243 --> 01:13:03,243
Okay.

741
01:13:33,493 --> 01:13:35,035
Motherfucker!

742
01:13:46,035 --> 01:13:48,868
I think they believe we call in aircraft.

743
01:13:52,451 --> 01:13:55,410
- I can't take this.
- Duane. Duane.

744
01:13:56,368 --> 01:13:57,743
- You hang in.
- I can't take it anymore.

745
01:13:57,868 --> 01:13:59,201
You hang in.

746
01:14:00,618 --> 01:14:02,451
I'm your true friend.

747
01:14:02,868 --> 01:14:04,493
I'm your true friend.
I would not lie to you.

748
01:14:04,576 --> 01:14:06,743
I will never let you down, okay?

749
01:14:06,868 --> 01:14:08,285
- Okay.
- Never.

750
01:14:11,285 --> 01:14:12,910
- Okay.
- Never.

751
01:14:13,035 --> 01:14:14,201
Okay.

752
01:14:40,993 --> 01:14:41,951
Hey.

753
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:43,743
So, listen.

754
01:14:44,451 --> 01:14:46,993
Once we have got the guards,

755
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:50,368
we are gonna set up a perimeter.

756
01:14:51,326 --> 01:14:53,326
If reinforcements come along
this jungle path...

757
01:14:54,576 --> 01:14:56,826
They're having some kind of
discussion in the kitchen.

758
01:14:56,910 --> 01:15:00,368
I understand what they are saying.
I just need to hear.

759
01:15:13,868 --> 01:15:16,034
Hey, what's going on?

760
01:15:16,118 --> 01:15:17,326
Silence.

761
01:15:21,743 --> 01:15:22,993
So what are they saying?

762
01:15:23,076 --> 01:15:24,701
What they're discussing is this.

763
01:15:24,826 --> 01:15:27,534
They sent some villagers out
to forage for some rice.

764
01:15:27,659 --> 01:15:29,618
- Yeah?
- They came back with nothing.

765
01:15:29,743 --> 01:15:33,368
Ever since the bombings,
the entire province cannot grow rice.

766
01:15:33,493 --> 01:15:35,159
I didn't think it could get any worse.

767
01:15:35,243 --> 01:15:37,409
No, it's much worse than that.

768
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:41,493
They plan to march us out
in the jungle and kill us,

769
01:15:41,576 --> 01:15:44,659
and make it look as if
we were trying to escape.

770
01:15:45,951 --> 01:15:50,409
They wanna all go back to their villages
and somehow try to get some food.

771
01:15:50,951 --> 01:15:53,868
The ringleaders are Little Hitler
and Crazy Horse.

772
01:15:53,993 --> 01:15:56,493
- I knew it.
- Okay, so

773
01:15:57,909 --> 01:15:59,951
it has to be tomorrow.

774
01:16:00,326 --> 01:16:01,618
Come here.

775
01:16:03,118 --> 01:16:04,284
Procet.

776
01:16:05,993 --> 01:16:11,076
We are still a day short of
Independence Day, but so what.

777
01:16:11,743 --> 01:16:14,451
Hey, there's no rain.

778
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:17,201
Tomorrow,

779
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:19,743
chow time.

780
01:17:23,409 --> 01:17:26,034
So then, Duane and I

781
01:17:27,243 --> 01:17:30,743
will go this way outside of the fence.

782
01:17:31,243 --> 01:17:35,784
The four of you will go this way
outside of the fence.

783
01:17:35,909 --> 01:17:39,951
And we must all arrive at the kitchen

784
01:17:40,076 --> 01:17:43,951
at the same moment to encircle them.

785
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:47,868
This is the most important thing, okay?

786
01:17:47,951 --> 01:17:52,284
And then you two,
you will interrogate the guards.

787
01:18:03,284 --> 01:18:06,534
Okay.
Where the hell is the tower?

788
01:18:07,409 --> 01:18:09,034
Where's the tower?

789
01:18:11,201 --> 01:18:14,868
Okay. Yes. Those three are in the kitchen.
I think that is it.

790
01:18:14,993 --> 01:18:17,076
I think they're all in the kitchen,
I think.

791
01:18:17,201 --> 01:18:19,451
This is it. I'm going.

792
01:18:22,743 --> 01:18:25,493
Dieter, good luck.

793
01:18:40,909 --> 01:18:42,409
Quiet, quiet.

794
01:19:51,909 --> 01:19:57,534
Quickly. Kitchen. Kitchen.
Meet us at the kitchen. Yes? Okay.

795
01:20:20,784 --> 01:20:24,409
Duane, come on.
Come on. Oh, God.

796
01:20:32,367 --> 01:20:35,492
Oh, God, there are six or seven
or something.

797
01:20:43,659 --> 01:20:45,826
Gene! Procet! Come on!

798
01:20:56,117 --> 01:20:58,826
Procet! Gene!
Where the hell are you?

799
01:20:58,909 --> 01:21:01,909
Gene! Damn you, where are...
Duane, come on!

800
01:21:02,034 --> 01:21:05,784
Duane, where the hell are you!

801
01:21:05,909 --> 01:21:07,534
Jumbo, don't try anything.

802
01:21:07,617 --> 01:21:09,826
Go on! Go on, run!

803
01:21:09,909 --> 01:21:11,076
Run!

804
01:21:11,201 --> 01:21:12,909
God damn you!

805
01:21:13,492 --> 01:21:15,034
Where are the shoes?

806
01:21:15,159 --> 01:21:19,451
The shoes are always hanging here.
Look for them! Go on, look for them.

807
01:21:20,326 --> 01:21:23,076
This is terrible.
This is terrible.

808
01:21:23,201 --> 01:21:24,742
Come on. Get something.
Get this bag.

809
01:21:24,867 --> 01:21:26,701
- There's no shoes.
- Get this bag.

810
01:21:27,242 --> 01:21:29,284
Get as much as you can.

811
01:21:29,576 --> 01:21:31,534
God damn you, Gene!

812
01:21:31,617 --> 01:21:33,326
God damn you!

813
01:21:34,909 --> 01:21:38,492
We have to leave. We have to leave.
The guards will be coming back.

814
01:21:38,576 --> 01:21:39,826
Come on.

815
01:22:12,742 --> 01:22:14,742
Duane. Duane. Not in the open.
Not in the open. Come on. Come on.

816
01:22:35,242 --> 01:22:36,409
Dieter.

817
01:22:38,742 --> 01:22:43,325
Y. C., what the hell happened?
Why didn't you show up at the kitchen?

818
01:22:43,409 --> 01:22:46,200
Gene?
Gene, where the hell were you?

819
01:22:46,325 --> 01:22:49,159
Gene, where the hell have you been?

820
01:22:49,242 --> 01:22:51,992
Did you hear the shooting?
Did you?

821
01:22:52,784 --> 01:22:54,117
I couldn't get a shot.

822
01:22:54,242 --> 01:22:58,700
Oh, you couldn't get a shot at them.
You weren't there to get a shot at them.

823
01:22:59,075 --> 01:23:01,534
Look at these.
What nice shoes you have.

824
01:23:01,659 --> 01:23:04,367
Where are our shoes?
Where are our shoes?

825
01:23:06,242 --> 01:23:07,367
Phisit.

826
01:23:08,534 --> 01:23:11,200
You're telling me that he took
three pairs of shoes?

827
01:23:11,284 --> 01:23:14,409
He took his, he took Duane's
and he took mine?

828
01:23:14,534 --> 01:23:15,825
- That's right.
- Yeah.

829
01:23:15,909 --> 01:23:16,909
- Yeah.
- That's right.

830
01:23:17,034 --> 01:23:19,367
So, you were busy getting your machetes

831
01:23:19,492 --> 01:23:22,075
and your nice shoes
while we were being shot at.

832
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:25,700
Okay. Where was this rifle?
Where did you find this rifle?

833
01:23:26,492 --> 01:23:27,825
Where'd you get that?

834
01:23:27,909 --> 01:23:29,117
Where am I gonna go?

835
01:23:29,242 --> 01:23:31,825
I don't know where you're gonna go.
Where'd you get the rifle?

836
01:23:31,909 --> 01:23:35,534
Or did you just find that?
You just found it lying around?

837
01:23:36,534 --> 01:23:37,617
We found it.

838
01:23:37,742 --> 01:23:39,159
Okay, listen, that's it.

839
01:23:39,242 --> 01:23:42,367
Listen, I have an ammo clip for you.

840
01:23:42,492 --> 01:23:45,075
My ammo clip for your machete.

841
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:46,700
Oh, yeah.

842
01:23:49,075 --> 01:23:50,659
Oh, that's funny?

843
01:23:51,034 --> 01:23:54,159
- Why is that funny?
- 'Cause I was just thinking,

844
01:23:54,575 --> 01:23:59,034
maybe you'll go back and get one yourself.

845
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:01,117
Maybe I'll go back
and get one myself? Okay.

846
01:24:01,242 --> 01:24:03,159
Happy now
you got to do your big plan?

847
01:24:03,242 --> 01:24:04,242
Yes.

848
01:24:04,367 --> 01:24:05,700
Yes.

849
01:24:05,992 --> 01:24:07,950
Yeah, I bet you're happy.

850
01:24:16,117 --> 01:24:17,825
You hand me that machete.

851
01:24:17,909 --> 01:24:19,492
You hand me that machete.

852
01:24:19,617 --> 01:24:21,534
You tell me where to go.

853
01:24:24,242 --> 01:24:26,200
You tell me where to go.

854
01:24:28,534 --> 01:24:30,742
I don't know where you can go.

855
01:24:32,367 --> 01:24:33,992
I didn't think so.

856
01:24:34,534 --> 01:24:36,034
Didn't think so.

857
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:42,825
Gene. Gene.

858
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:44,492
What's that? What's that?

859
01:24:44,575 --> 01:24:46,034
Yeah, Dieter.

860
01:24:47,075 --> 01:24:49,242
Is that where you're going?

861
01:24:49,367 --> 01:24:53,700
See you, Duane. Duane, love you, brother.
You go that way, I'll go this way.

862
01:24:55,992 --> 01:24:57,909
But where am I gonna go?

863
01:25:00,659 --> 01:25:02,492
I'm gonna go over there.

864
01:25:03,909 --> 01:25:05,700
Where am I gonna go?

865
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:11,909
Where am I gonna go?

866
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:32,825
Dieter.

867
01:25:34,742 --> 01:25:36,325
It's gonna rain.

868
01:25:37,117 --> 01:25:38,200
I know it.

869
01:25:38,325 --> 01:25:40,492
This is how it always starts.

870
01:27:09,325 --> 01:27:10,450
Duane.

871
01:27:13,450 --> 01:27:14,867
Look at this.

872
01:27:14,992 --> 01:27:17,492
You see over there?

873
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:20,992
See?

874
01:27:21,992 --> 01:27:24,033
Down there must be a river.

875
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:26,325
It must lead to the Big Muddy.

876
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:29,283
And then we'll be out of here.

877
01:27:29,867 --> 01:27:33,075
We'll build a raft, and we can float
all the way down to it.

878
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:34,575
No one will see us.

879
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:37,242
Then we can cross over into Thailand.

880
01:29:33,491 --> 01:29:34,950
Listen.

881
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:37,283
Do you hear that?

882
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:41,450
Is that a waterfall?

883
01:29:51,325 --> 01:29:53,950
Waterfall!
Waterfall, bail out!

884
01:29:55,116 --> 01:29:56,408
Dieter!

885
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:09,616
Dieter!

886
01:30:21,533 --> 01:30:23,491
- Careful!
- The shore!

887
01:30:23,991 --> 01:30:25,491
Grab the shore!

888
01:33:40,366 --> 01:33:43,283
Hey, pick a hand.

889
01:33:46,616 --> 01:33:47,616
No.

890
01:33:53,866 --> 01:33:56,324
Which one of your feet is worse off?

891
01:33:56,866 --> 01:33:59,116
That's a trick question, right?

892
01:34:07,366 --> 01:34:09,491
We can trade off with this thing.

893
01:34:11,158 --> 01:34:14,699
There's no way
that we shoot it out with the Vietcong

894
01:34:14,824 --> 01:34:16,533
if we run into them, so...

895
01:34:17,699 --> 01:34:21,241
And we can't use these for hunting
because of the noise.

896
01:34:24,241 --> 01:34:26,033
You wanna ditch them?

897
01:34:27,658 --> 01:34:28,699
Yeah.

898
01:34:38,741 --> 01:34:41,199
I'm sick of carrying these, anyway.

899
01:35:06,741 --> 01:35:07,908
Oh, God.

900
01:35:38,908 --> 01:35:40,033
Duane.

901
01:35:42,366 --> 01:35:43,533
We got to move.

902
01:35:43,658 --> 01:35:45,116
I'm too tired.

903
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:47,699
- Keep moving.
- No, I'm too tired.

904
01:35:48,699 --> 01:35:50,199
Come on, buddy.

905
01:35:52,741 --> 01:35:54,699
I can't go on any longer.

906
01:36:32,199 --> 01:36:33,324
Duane.

907
01:36:34,866 --> 01:36:36,032
Duane.

908
01:36:37,199 --> 01:36:38,824
These are huts.

909
01:36:39,616 --> 01:36:43,282
This is an abandoned village.

910
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:46,657
This is a hut.

911
01:36:48,199 --> 01:36:49,157
No.

912
01:36:49,574 --> 01:36:51,657
- Yeah.
- It's all jungle.

913
01:36:53,074 --> 01:36:54,407
Be careful.

914
01:37:16,366 --> 01:37:17,824
- I'm done.
- No.

915
01:37:19,116 --> 01:37:20,532
Travel by night.

916
01:37:20,657 --> 01:37:22,699
No, I'm telling you,
I can't go any further.

917
01:37:22,824 --> 01:37:24,741
You just leave me here.

918
01:37:26,032 --> 01:37:27,866
We'll travel by night.

919
01:37:28,199 --> 01:37:29,824
I help you along.

920
01:37:29,907 --> 01:37:32,782
When we reach the Big Muddy,
we'll make it across,

921
01:37:32,866 --> 01:37:37,699
and I'm sure we're gonna run right
into an American officers' club.

922
01:37:38,866 --> 01:37:40,407
And we're gonna go
straight into the kitchen,

923
01:37:40,532 --> 01:37:43,491
and we're gonna order a burger
and French fries

924
01:37:43,616 --> 01:37:46,532
and milkshake and ice cream sundaes.

925
01:37:46,907 --> 01:37:49,366
All that sweet stuff that you like.

926
01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:56,741
Duane! Duane!
There's choppers!

927
01:37:56,866 --> 01:37:58,782
Duane! Duane, look!

928
01:37:58,866 --> 01:38:02,032
There's... Oh,
here we are!

929
01:38:02,157 --> 01:38:03,574
Here we are!

930
01:38:03,699 --> 01:38:06,782
Oh, please!
Please, be real!

931
01:38:06,866 --> 01:38:10,282
Here we are! It's your buddies!
It's your buddies!

932
01:38:10,366 --> 01:38:12,032
Oh, yes!

933
01:38:12,157 --> 01:38:14,657
Thank you! Thank you!

934
01:38:14,741 --> 01:38:17,491
We're here! We're here!

935
01:38:17,866 --> 01:38:19,199
No!

936
01:38:19,366 --> 01:38:20,949
We're here!

937
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:23,741
Where are you going?

938
01:38:25,074 --> 01:38:26,574
We are here!

939
01:38:27,532 --> 01:38:29,116
Stop!

940
01:38:30,991 --> 01:38:33,866
You idiots,
where are you going?

941
01:38:41,991 --> 01:38:43,241
Please.

942
01:38:44,949 --> 01:38:46,157
Please.

943
01:38:46,657 --> 01:38:48,282
Please come back.

944
01:38:49,616 --> 01:38:51,199
Please come back.

945
01:39:13,699 --> 01:39:15,199
- Keep your voice down.
- Duane.

946
01:39:15,324 --> 01:39:16,491
- Dieter.
- Duane.

947
01:39:16,574 --> 01:39:18,991
- The guards are coming.
- Duane,

948
01:39:20,574 --> 01:39:22,157
I'm not speaking.

949
01:39:23,866 --> 01:39:25,449
I'm not speaking.

950
01:39:26,866 --> 01:39:30,949
God, why don't you help us
when we need you most?

951
01:39:31,032 --> 01:39:34,032
Keep your voice down.
They're coming.

952
01:39:46,365 --> 01:39:47,657
Come here.

953
01:39:48,574 --> 01:39:49,824
Lie down.

954
01:39:58,199 --> 01:39:59,699
Lie down there.

955
01:40:01,199 --> 01:40:02,407
Lie down.

956
01:40:03,615 --> 01:40:04,865
Okay.

957
01:40:07,365 --> 01:40:12,032
Listen, I'm gonna build
a fire tonight, a big one.

958
01:40:12,199 --> 01:40:14,907
And those helicopters,
they will see it.

959
01:40:15,199 --> 01:40:16,949
And they will come for us.

960
01:40:17,032 --> 01:40:19,157
Okay, they will come for us.

961
01:40:25,324 --> 01:40:27,615
Come on, come on.

962
01:40:28,949 --> 01:40:30,157
Yes.

963
01:41:11,157 --> 01:41:12,824
Here we are!

964
01:41:13,699 --> 01:41:17,240
Here we are! Oh, yes!

965
01:41:17,365 --> 01:41:20,990
Oh, thank God! Oh, yes!

966
01:41:21,115 --> 01:41:22,324
Yeah!

967
01:41:22,865 --> 01:41:24,240
Yes!

968
01:41:34,157 --> 01:41:35,824
You idiots!

969
01:41:35,949 --> 01:41:38,157
You almost killed me!

970
01:42:35,365 --> 01:42:37,782
I dreamed there was a fire.

971
01:42:40,324 --> 01:42:44,990
Why did they think a whole damn village
would be burning?

972
01:42:45,907 --> 01:42:48,115
How could we be Vietcong?

973
01:42:51,365 --> 01:42:53,490
Now they must've heard us.

974
01:42:53,574 --> 01:42:55,157
They must've seen this.

975
01:42:55,240 --> 01:42:59,199
The Vietcong will be on their way.
They could be here any moment.

976
01:43:03,115 --> 01:43:04,324
Let's leave here.

977
01:45:23,782 --> 01:45:25,282
Dieter.

978
01:45:28,990 --> 01:45:30,323
Dieter.

979
01:45:34,032 --> 01:45:35,615
My feet are cold.

980
01:47:17,031 --> 01:47:18,240
I'm cold.

981
01:47:21,156 --> 01:47:22,740
My feet are cold.

982
01:47:28,948 --> 01:47:30,781
You can have the sole.

983
01:47:44,740 --> 01:47:45,865
Duane?

984
01:49:37,865 --> 01:49:39,698
Hey, you!

985
01:49:40,906 --> 01:49:42,531
I'm here!

986
01:49:44,823 --> 01:49:46,990
Please turn around.

987
01:49:50,073 --> 01:49:51,615
Hey!

988
01:49:54,656 --> 01:49:57,323
Don't leave. Hey!

989
01:49:58,990 --> 01:50:01,490
Hey! Hey!

990
01:50:05,906 --> 01:50:07,573
Don't go away.

991
01:50:09,990 --> 01:50:11,615
Don't go away.

992
01:50:17,031 --> 01:50:18,323
Hey!

993
01:50:19,239 --> 01:50:21,073
Oh, come on!

994
01:50:23,656 --> 01:50:25,323
Oh, please!

995
01:50:25,698 --> 01:50:27,156
Come on!

996
01:50:35,698 --> 01:50:38,823
Okay. Hey!

997
01:50:39,406 --> 01:50:43,031
Over here! Over here!

998
01:50:43,156 --> 01:50:45,531
Help me! Come on,
come on, come on.

999
01:50:46,156 --> 01:50:48,906
Come on down.
Yeah, come on.

1000
01:50:53,489 --> 01:50:54,781
They're coming.

1001
01:50:59,031 --> 01:51:01,031
Yes! Yes, please!

1002
01:51:02,448 --> 01:51:03,989
See me!

1003
01:51:12,739 --> 01:51:13,698
Yes!

1004
01:52:13,198 --> 01:52:14,698
Who are you, buddy?

1005
01:52:14,823 --> 01:52:16,156
Name?

1006
01:52:16,573 --> 01:52:21,989
Flight Lieutenant Dieter Dengler,
U.S.S. Ranger.

1007
01:52:22,073 --> 01:52:23,323
Authenticator?

1008
01:52:23,406 --> 01:52:24,573
- What's your authenticator?
- Rescue Dawn.

1009
01:52:24,698 --> 01:52:25,906
- Rescue Dawn.
- Louder!

1010
01:52:26,031 --> 01:52:27,531
Rescue Dawn!

1011
01:52:27,656 --> 01:52:30,448
- Favorite sport?
- Hunting.

1012
01:52:30,531 --> 01:52:32,739
Favorite fish?

1013
01:52:32,864 --> 01:52:33,948
Trout.

1014
01:52:34,031 --> 01:52:35,989
Confirmed.
Confirmed. It's him!

1015
01:52:36,073 --> 01:52:38,239
I can't believe it.

1016
01:52:38,364 --> 01:52:40,448
Jesus, buddy,
you made it out of the bush.

1017
01:52:40,531 --> 01:52:41,989
Bring him home!

1018
01:52:43,364 --> 01:52:45,156
He's coming home with us.

1019
01:52:45,239 --> 01:52:47,739
- Oh, shit!
- Going home.

1020
01:52:47,864 --> 01:52:49,156
All right.

1021
01:52:53,406 --> 01:52:55,156
Way to go, buddy.

1022
01:53:44,906 --> 01:53:46,656
Easy, easy, easy.

1023
01:53:47,531 --> 01:53:51,156
Hold up here, hold up here.
Hey, everyone listen to me.

1024
01:53:51,697 --> 01:53:53,114
- We're in charge here.
- Back up. Back up.

1025
01:53:53,197 --> 01:53:56,447
This man has been on
a highly classified operation. Hold.

1026
01:53:56,531 --> 01:53:59,489
No one is to see him. No one is to
touch him. No one is to talk to him.

1027
01:53:59,572 --> 01:54:01,656
- Get him inside.
- You'll forget what you've seen.

1028
01:54:01,781 --> 01:54:05,072
In fact, from now on,
it's a black operation. Is that clear?

1029
01:54:05,197 --> 01:54:06,239
You got me on that?

1030
01:54:06,364 --> 01:54:07,781
- Back up. Back up.
- Stand back.

1031
01:54:07,864 --> 01:54:09,364
All right. Let's go.

1032
01:54:11,697 --> 01:54:13,739
You're doing great, Dieter.

1033
01:54:14,072 --> 01:54:16,156
You don't need this anymore.

1034
01:54:20,489 --> 01:54:24,322
Hey, when can I go back
to my ship?

1035
01:54:26,447 --> 01:54:27,864
I don't know.

1036
01:54:57,281 --> 01:54:59,364
Okay, go, go, go, go, go.

1037
01:55:01,864 --> 01:55:03,989
You guys are a lot of fun.

1038
01:55:04,072 --> 01:55:08,614
You know, how many times I have to
tell you? I don't know the coordinates.

1039
01:55:08,697 --> 01:55:11,197
Let's go back to the guards.
Tell me about their uniforms.

1040
01:55:11,322 --> 01:55:14,614
There were some with red stars,
maybe they're Vietcong.

1041
01:55:14,697 --> 01:55:16,989
The others were Laotians...

1042
01:55:17,114 --> 01:55:18,364
Oh, no.

1043
01:55:18,489 --> 01:55:19,822
Oh, no.

1044
01:55:22,197 --> 01:55:23,447
Dieter!

1045
01:55:23,531 --> 01:55:24,864
There's my buddies.

1046
01:55:24,989 --> 01:55:28,031
- Happy birthday.
- That's my buddies.

1047
01:55:28,156 --> 01:55:29,322
You made it.

1048
01:55:29,406 --> 01:55:31,489
It's good to see you, Spook.

1049
01:55:32,697 --> 01:55:33,822
Dieter.

1050
01:55:33,947 --> 01:55:36,489
Norman. Oh, my God.

1051
01:55:36,614 --> 01:55:38,822
Gentlemen, can you give us a
couple of minutes alone, please?

1052
01:55:38,906 --> 01:55:40,364
It should be all right.

1053
01:55:40,447 --> 01:55:43,197
I got a little letter from his fiance.

1054
01:55:43,322 --> 01:55:45,239
It's kind of personal.
You know what I mean?

1055
01:55:45,364 --> 01:55:47,156
Keep it personal, Lieutenant.

1056
01:55:47,281 --> 01:55:50,281
We're in the middle of a
highly classified debriefing.

1057
01:55:50,364 --> 01:55:51,906
Will do.
It's from his old lady.

1058
01:55:52,031 --> 01:55:53,572
- Ten minutes.
- Okay.

1059
01:55:53,697 --> 01:55:55,197
Thank you, gentlemen.

1060
01:55:55,322 --> 01:55:56,364
Thank you.

1061
01:55:56,489 --> 01:56:01,197
Hey, Spook, what's with the birthday...
It's not my birthday.

1062
01:56:01,322 --> 01:56:06,197
Dieter, those two CIA dudes wanna take
you back to Guam for debriefing.

1063
01:56:06,947 --> 01:56:09,239
You don't wanna do that, do you?

1064
01:56:10,197 --> 01:56:11,822
I didn't think so.

1065
01:56:33,072 --> 01:56:34,531
Hey, hold on, guys.

1066
01:56:35,072 --> 01:56:38,989
Hey, guys,
he's a bit choked up in there.

1067
01:56:39,739 --> 01:56:44,239
You mind giving him just a couple of
minutes to sort of pull himself together?

1068
01:56:44,364 --> 01:56:46,864
Yeah, it should be fine.
We'll give it a few minutes.

1069
01:56:46,989 --> 01:56:49,072
- He's a good kid, huh?
- Yeah.

1070
01:56:49,197 --> 01:56:50,822
- Thanks, guys.
- Yup.

1071
01:56:59,864 --> 01:57:05,572
Right, left.
Left, left, left, right, left.

1072
01:57:10,531 --> 01:57:11,947
Come on, now.

1073
01:57:13,864 --> 01:57:15,989
Hurry up. Come on, get him in.

1074
01:57:17,197 --> 01:57:19,155
Get him in now, fast!

1075
01:57:19,239 --> 01:57:20,572
Get inside.

1076
01:57:33,864 --> 01:57:35,489
It's my day!

1077
01:57:46,030 --> 01:57:47,655
What are we doing?

1078
01:58:06,905 --> 01:58:08,155
- Hey.
- What?

1079
01:58:08,239 --> 01:58:09,947
Where is everybody?

1080
01:58:10,030 --> 01:58:11,030
- Where?
- Right here.

1081
01:58:11,155 --> 01:58:13,489
Why the decks... They're empty.
Have they gone home?

1082
01:58:13,572 --> 01:58:16,030
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1083
01:58:16,572 --> 01:58:17,655
They're on vacation.

1084
01:58:17,780 --> 01:58:19,364
Is the war over?

1085
01:58:20,822 --> 01:58:21,905
No.

1086
01:58:27,864 --> 01:58:30,239
You know I'm in a lot of trouble.

1087
01:58:37,197 --> 01:58:38,864
Boys, here he is.

1088
01:58:38,989 --> 01:58:41,364
They kidnapped him,
they brought him here to us.

1089
01:58:41,447 --> 01:58:44,489
The CIA held him for four days
but they can't hang onto him forever!

1090
01:58:44,614 --> 01:58:47,155
Dieter Dengler!

1091
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:56,655
All right, all right.
Hold on. Hold on a second.

1092
01:58:56,739 --> 01:58:58,197
Boys, listen up for a second.

1093
01:58:58,280 --> 01:59:00,780
Admiral Willoughby's
got something to say.

1094
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:02,572
Lieutenant Dengler.

1095
01:59:05,530 --> 01:59:07,364
Good to have you back.

1096
01:59:11,197 --> 01:59:13,114
- Thank you.
- All right. That's not all.

1097
01:59:13,197 --> 01:59:16,655
There's more! Hold on, fellows.
Hold on, hold on!

1098
01:59:17,739 --> 01:59:19,155
So, let's start with the man himself.

1099
01:59:19,239 --> 01:59:21,155
Dieter, it is just
incredible you made it home.

1100
01:59:21,239 --> 01:59:24,405
Now, tell us, was it your faith
in God and country?

1101
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:28,364
Come on, Dieter,
you got to believe in something.

1102
01:59:28,489 --> 01:59:30,072
I believe I need a steak.

1103
01:59:30,197 --> 01:59:32,905
A steak!
This guy needs a steak!

1104
01:59:33,030 --> 01:59:35,114
We're grilling up a big old cow for you.

1105
01:59:35,197 --> 01:59:38,322
All right.
Hey, listen up. Hang on.

1106
01:59:38,405 --> 01:59:40,780
Can you pass something on to the boys?

1107
01:59:40,864 --> 01:59:42,447
You know, something you learned
during your ordeal,

1108
01:59:42,530 --> 01:59:46,489
something to keep them going
no matter how bad it gets?

1109
01:59:47,239 --> 01:59:48,614
Sure I can.

1110
01:59:51,322 --> 01:59:54,530
Empty what is full.

1111
01:59:55,905 --> 01:59:58,489
Fill what is empty.

1112
02:00:02,447 --> 02:00:05,280
Scratch where it itches.
That's it.

1113
02:00:05,364 --> 02:00:07,030
Now look at these boys' faces.

1114
02:00:07,155 --> 02:00:09,072
Do they love you, man!

1115
02:00:09,197 --> 02:00:12,822
Do they love you!
