1
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,857
It was a Charlie Foxtrot, 
without a doubt.

2
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,575
Without a doubt.
I've never seen anything like it.

3
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,693
I never thought that 
I would ever see American soldiers

4
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,733
so depressed and morale so low,

5
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,738
and it was just unbelievable.
Everything about it.

6
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,815
<i>You got to consider yourself dead.</i>

7
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,094
<i>And if you come back,
you're just a lucky bastard.</i>

8
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,259
<i>You know, but if you're there
and you consider yourself already dead,</i>

9
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,974
<i>you can do all the shit you have to do.</i>

10
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,771
<i>I wouldn't recommend a vacation
to Iraq anytime soon.</i>

11
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:53,168
<i>When Saddam's sons 
Uday and Qusay were killed,</i>

12
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,692
<i>there was a great deal of information seized.</i>

13
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,449
This was a key operation.

14
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,855
We no longer have to worry
about Uday and Qusay,

15
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,052
but we need to use this information
to find Saddam.

16
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,569
<i>After that big event,
the Secretary of Defence came to visit us.</i>

17
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,777
He wanted to see the prison.
He wanted to see the progress.

18
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,733
He wanted to...
Of course, every trip out there by anybody

19
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,455
included a trip to the torture chambers
and the hanging facility.

20
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,411
So we scheduled different events.

21
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,738
<i>The first stop was 
Saddam's hanging chambers.</i>

22
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,459
<i>We were preparing
to continue his walking tour</i>

23
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,652
<i>and he said,
"No. I don't want to go anywhere else.</i>

24
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,536
<i>"Let some soldiers come over here
and we'll take some pictures.</i>

25
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,096
<i>"I don't need to see anything else
in the prison."</i>

26
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,778
<i>And then he left.</i>

27
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,770
<i>Enter General Miller,</i>

28
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:13,169
the guru of interrogation
and obtaining actionable intelligence.

29
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,097
And he arrives the day after Rumsfeld's visit.

30
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,009
He was gonna "Gitmo-ise" the operation.

31
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,812
Contract interrogators,

32
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,853
military people that had experience
in Afghanistan or down at Guantanamo Bay,

33
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,448
they all arrived after Miller's visit.

34
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,449
He gives an in-brief. He's not afraid to say,
"You have to treat the prisoners like dogs.

35
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,572
"They have to know that you are in control."

36
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,931
Cell block 1A transfers to the control

37
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,172
of the military intelligence
brigade commander, Colonel Pappas.

38
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,450
Cell block 1B, several days later,

39
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,538
under the control of Colonel Pappas
and away from me.

40
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,220
They're going to use those cells exclusively

41
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,808
for higher value security detainees.

42
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,816
<i>Abu Ghraib was becoming exactly</i>

43
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,615
<i>what General Miller said
he wanted to make it,</i>

44
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,493
<i>the interrogation centre of Iraq.</i>

45
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,696
<i>"October 1, 2003. 
First day at the prison.</i>

46
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,608
<i>"It's 9 p.m., and we can hear shots.</i>

47
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,971
<i>"No white lights are allowed 
to be on at night.</i>

48
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,534
<i>"No leaving the building after dark.</i>

49
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,299
<i>"I hope we ain't here long.</i>

50
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,729
<i>"We drove in and two helicopters were landing,</i>

51
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,249
<i>"taking prisoners off.</i>

52
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,338
<i>"I'm scared of helicopters
because of the dream.</i>

53
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,414
<i>"The tail was swaying back and forth.</i>

54
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,293
<i>"Then a huge flame shot up,
and it exploded.</i>

55
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,212
<i>"I have a bad feeling about this place.</i>

56
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,095
<i>"The prison is called Abu Ghraib.
30,000 people were murdered here.</i>

57
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,458
<i>"There's a chamber
where these men were hung.</i>

58
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,898
<i>"I'm not sure about ghosts, 
but it is freaky.</i>

59
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:31,494
<i>"I'm hoping to be home for Christmas,
or soon after. I love you. Sabrina."</i>

60
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:39,371
We're coming up the road,
we see this huge structure.

61
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,331
It's like six football fields.

62
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,817
Then we seen this sign saying like,
"Fallujah," right there, next town over.

63
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,135
We're like,
"Yo, we right in the heart of it right now."

64
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,538
We get inside, it's nothing but rubble,
blown-up buildings from shelling,

65
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,132
<i>dogs running all over the place,
burnt remains.</i>

66
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:03,459
<i>The stench was unbearable.
Urine, faeces, body rot.</i>

67
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,050
<i>It was just disgusting.
You didn't want to touch anything.</i>

68
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,491
<i>And then we had to move 
into prison cells ourselves.</i>

69
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:26,257
You're walking around in your compound.
Next thing you know, boom.

70
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,530
Incoming. Everyone's yelling, "Incoming."
Like, boom,

71
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,128
"Incoming, incoming!" You got to run.

72
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,893
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
Goddamn, you're getting mad,

73
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,535
'cause it happens over and over
and over and over and over again.

74
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,413
After a while, the fear goes away
and you just get angry.

75
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,098
It's like, "Damn it, can we shoot back?"

76
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:49,175
One pierced the roof of the prison
right to the floor, but it didn't explode.

77
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,609
Land on the floor.
Soldiers in there are like, "Holy crap."

78
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,008
<i>Well, they ain't say, "Holy crap."
Now, you know what they said.</i>

79
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,091
<i>When you walk from the main portion
of the prison, and you get to 1A, 1B,</i>

80
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,256
they already had intelligence detainees down there.

81
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,052
That's when I saw the nakedness.

82
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:21,168
I'm like, "Hey, Sarge,
why is everyone naked?" You know.

83
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,851
"Hey, that's the MI. That's what the MI does.
That's the MI thing. I don't know."

84
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,778
"Why these guys have on women's panties?"

85
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,209
He's like, "This is to break them."

86
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,296
There's guys naked, 
guys in women's panties,

87
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,696
guys, you know,
handcuffed in stress positions,

88
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,654
you know, in isolation cells,
no lights, no windows.

89
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,534
You open the door, turn the light on.
"Oh, my God, Allah."

90
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,699
Click, turn the light off, close the door.
It's like, "Whoa, what is that?"

91
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,733
It was like, "Hey, that's Military Intelligence.
You know, just stay out their way."

92
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,454
And from then on, I was like, 
"Something's not right here."

93
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,058
I was working on operations.

94
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,650
Some nights I'd get off work at 10:00.
Some nights I'd be working all night.

95
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,969
Depends on how many prisoners we got in.

96
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,618
Sometimes we'd get up to 200 that evening
and I'd be there till 6:00 the next morning,

97
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,016
and then I had guard duty at 6:00 a.m.
and I'd get off guard duty,

98
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,176
get a couple hours sleep
and then go back to work.

99
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,089
<i>Usually I'd go over to the hard site
after my work day ended.</i>

100
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,848
<i>You know, it'd just be 
Megan and Graner and Freddy,</i>

101
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,609
<i>maybe up in the office 
watching a movie on his laptop.</i>

102
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,173
Some nights I'd go up there

103
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,009
and there would be different people
in stress positions here and there,

104
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,415
and got them up on MRE boxes doing squats,

105
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,010
or running up and down the tier,
or something.

106
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:56,333
We thought it was unusual,
and weird and wrong,

107
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:02,057
but when we first got there,
the example was already set.

108
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:06,696
That's what we saw. 
I mean, it was okay.

109
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,334
The first thing that I noticed were...

110
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,617
Was this guy. 
He had underwear on his head

111
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,335
and he was handcuffed backwards to a window.

112
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,453
And they were pretty much
asking him questions.

113
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,492
That's the first time
I started taking photos.

114
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,930
I wrote a letter home to Kelly,
who is my wife.

115
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,851
<i>"October 20th, 2003.</i>

116
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,570
<i>"I can't get it out of my head.</i>

117
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,137
<i>"I walked downstairs to find
the taxi cab driver handcuffed backwards,</i>

118
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,297
<i>"naked with his underwear
over his head and face.</i>

119
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,372
<i>"He looked like Jesus Christ.
At first I had to laugh,</i>

120
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,890
<i>"so I went and grabbed a camera
and took a picture.</i>

121
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,899
<i>"One of the guys took my asp
and started poking at his dick.</i>

122
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,137
<i>"Okay. That's funny. 
Then it hit me.</i>

123
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,336
<i>"That's a form of molestation.</i>

124
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,891
<i>"I took more pictures now
to record what's going on.</i>

125
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,929
<i>"Not many people know this shit goes on.</i>

126
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,051
<i>"The only reason I want to be there
is to get the pictures</i>

127
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,378
<i>"to prove that the U.S. 
is not what they think.</i>

128
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,096
<i>"But I don't know if I could take it mentally.
What if it was me in their shoes?</i>

129
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,649
<i>"I thought I could handle anything.</i>

130
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,249
<i>"I was wrong."</i>

131
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,819
If I come up to you and I'm like, 
"Hey, this is going on,"

132
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,296
you probably wouldn't believe me
unless I had something to show you.

133
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,014
So if I say, "Hey, this is going on.
Look, I have proof,"

134
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,338
<i>you can't deny it.</i>

135
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,893
<i>Gus was the prisoner with the leash.</i>

136
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,213
We thought he was maybe
part of the Iraqi army,

137
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,409
because he was always, like, you know,

138
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,499
"Saddam's going to come back
and kill all of you. I hate you."

139
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,088
And all this stuff. 
He had all this anger.

140
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,495
And so we thought he was someone
maybe pretty important.

141
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,296
And then we found out the history 
of his arrest and why he was there.

142
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,696
And he had gotten drunk
and beat someone up.

143
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,414
He was just a regular prisoner,

144
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,008
like we'd find at one of our county jails,
or something.

145
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,737
Once he came over to the hard site,
he stopped eating.

146
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:52,332
And we had to pump him, you know, 
five to eight IVs a day,

147
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,179
or bags of IV fluid a day
just to keep him alive.

148
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:01,214
Gus was being verbally threatening
and not following any directions.

149
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,978
Graner put the leash on him.

150
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,013
And then he crawled out on his own 
after that.

151
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,052
And then he handed the leash to Lynndie.

152
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,932
And that's when he took the pictures.

153
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,096
And then the guy got up on his own
after that.

154
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,290
They were trying to say
that she was dragging him,

155
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,092
which never occurred.

156
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,097
I was there, and I know it didn't happen.

157
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,858
It may have been unorthodox,
but he came out of the cell

158
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,292
and he didn't hurt anybody,
and he didn't get hurt.

159
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,533
Graner had the camera in his cargo pocket.

160
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,732
And he asked me and Ambuhl
to come downstairs with him.

161
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,691
When he opened the door,

162
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,972
Gus was in there, he was naked.

163
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,298
He didn't want to stand up,
so that's why he brought the tie-down strap.

164
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:57,611
So he put it around his neck.
So he's gonna make him crawl out.

165
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,016
And I guess he got about halfway
out of the door.

166
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,773
Graner told me to hold onto the end
of the tie-down strap, so I did.

167
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,812
I just grabbed it.
You can see the slack on it.

168
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,137
People said that I dragged him,

169
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,454
but I never did.

170
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,693
<i>Graner took three pictures back-to-back.</i>

171
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,376
You can see Megan on the side standing.

172
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,451
He would've never had me standing
next to Gus if the camera wasn't there.

173
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:59,574
I'm a 95 to 100 pound female,
short female, at that,

174
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,057
holding a strap that's attached to his neck.
I'm dominating him.

175
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,740
Maybe that's what Graner was going for.

176
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,659
Maybe it was for documentation,
maybe it was for his own amusement.

177
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,738
I don't know. I don't know
what was going through his head.

178
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,259
But he took it.

179
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,132
In all the years as a cop,

180
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,649
I'd say over half of all my cases were solved

181
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,817
because the criminal did something stupid.

182
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,768
Taking photographs of these things
is that one something stupid.

183
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,889
<i>They gave me 12 CDs</i>

184
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,773
<i>and said, 
"There's thousands of pictures from Abu Ghraib.</i>

185
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,893
<i>"We want you to find all of them
that depict possible prisoner abuse,</i>

186
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,650
<i>"or people that were in the area at the time
that the abuse was occurring.</i>

187
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,214
"And we need to know exactly
when the pictures were taken."

188
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,732
<i>The pictures spoke a thousand words,</i>

189
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,771
<i>but unless you know
what day and time they're talking,</i>

190
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,892
<i>you wouldn't know what the story was.</i>

191
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,695
<i>I started lining pictures up
based on subject matter.</i>

192
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,335
<i>Put these on a time line
so that the jury could see</i>

193
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,419
<i>when did the incident begin
and when did it end.</i>

194
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,377
<i>How much time elapsed
in between these photographs.</i>

195
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:23,374
<i>How much actual effort did these people put
into what they were doing to the prisoners.</i>

196
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,175
<i>Who else was there in the room 
at the time that it occurred?</i>

197
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,971
<i>How could all this go on
without anybody noticing it?</i>

198
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,654
<i>When you look at this whole case
as one great, big media event,</i>

199
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,294
<i>you kind of lose focus.</i>

200
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:55,050
<i>These pictures actually depict
several separate incidents</i>

201
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:59,731
<i>of possible abuse
or possible standard operating procedure.</i>

202
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,895
All you could do is present 
what you know to be factual.

203
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,296
You can't bring in emotion or politics
into the court.

204
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,694
<i>When I was in the brig,</i>

205
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:17,894
every single woman there 
was in that brig because of a man.

206
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,696
Different reasons, yes,
but it was because of a man.

207
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,529
And when you join the military,
no matter what anybody says,

208
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,898
it's a man's world.

209
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,008
<i>You have to either equal a man
or be controlled by a man.</i>

210
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,416
<i>If you want to be their equal,
you got to be strong.</i>

211
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,178
They're going to try to control you.

212
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,009
You need to step up and tell them,
you know, show them who's boss.

213
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,258
"I'm not gonna take that.
I'm not gonna let you power me.

214
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,690
"You know, control me
because I'm a woman and you're a man.

215
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,459
"It's not gonna happen."
Even though it's the military.

216
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,936
I mean, hell, if you're in the military,
you got a gun.

217
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,209
Use it.

218
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,015
If I would have thought about that then,
by God, I would have.

219
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,451
But I was blinded 
by being in love with a man.

220
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,296
<i>Graner, he's really charming.</i>

221
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,648
<i>If you didn't know him
and you just meet him,</i>

222
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,691
<i>you'd be drawn in to him.</i>

223
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,856
<i>And in a crowded room,
he'd be the one to look at.</i>

224
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,177
<i>He would draw the attention.</i>

225
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,372
<i>If the attention is not on him,
he'll get it there.</i>

226
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,060
<i>That's what he does. 
He thrives on that.</i>

227
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,770
If you're not paying attention to him,
he'll make comments about you

228
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,572
and this and that, you know.

229
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,854
Whatever you wanna hear, he'll say it.
And he knows.

230
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,893
He knew. And I was, what, 
20 years old when I met him? He was 34.

231
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,773
He had 14 years more experience than I did.

232
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,693
So he knew what to say, what to do.

233
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:25,815
<i>And I was dumb enough to fall for it.
I should have listened.</i>

234
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,809
<i>Everyone tried to tell me,
"He's too old for you. He's a bad guy."</i>

235
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,851
<i>But I didn't believe them,</i>

236
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,096
because I believed him for some reason.

237
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,417
Can't figure it out now.

238
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,052
The population was just simply growing

239
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,729
but nobody really had a plan
on how you release

240
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:35,934
a formerly known as "suspected terrorist"
or an "associate of a terrorist."

241
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:41,134
General Wojdakowski told me,
after the first intake of prisoners,

242
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,899
that this was going to go on
for several weeks

243
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:49,652
and at the end of it we might have 
1,500 or more security detainees

244
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,248
that we would be responsible for.

245
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,452
And I said, "Don't you think 
you should have shared that information with me, sir?

246
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,969
"You know, I mean,
we don't have any resources to provide

247
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,570
"for the 200 prisoners
in the cells out at Abu Ghraib.

248
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,976
"And now you're going to give us 1500 more.

249
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,489
"What's the release procedures?"

250
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,818
He said, "You are not to release anybody.
Do you understand me?

251
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,853
"If any one of these prisoners gets released, 
or ends up out on the street,

252
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,413
"I'm coming after you."

253
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,051
They would go out
in the middle of the night

254
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:27,574
and sweep up every single, you know,
fighting age male and lock them all up.

255
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,933
That's why you hear the stories about 
sons and fathers and, you know, nephews,

256
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,255
all getting locked up.
That's what they would do.

257
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:39,214
Imagine someone coming to your town
and taking all the men in it.

258
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,689
They would come in, like, on cattle trucks,
and just like cattle.

259
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,892
I mean, you come to the back door,
I mean, you hear a bang on the door,

260
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,092
you know, bang, bang, bang,
here come the deuce and a half truck

261
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,532
full of scared individuals coming to jail.

262
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,810
Were like, 
"They come get me in middle of night.

263
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,410
"Mister, Mister, what, am I in trouble?
What I do? I'm not terrorist."

264
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,818
You know, they were like taxicab drivers
and welders and, like, bakers,

265
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,009
and they're at Abu Ghraib.

266
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,535
We had kids.

267
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,652
If we can't get the insurgent leader,
we took their kid.

268
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:18,013
"Akbar, I have your son. Your son is in jail.
Turn yourself in and we'll let your son go."

269
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,379
I call that kidnapping.

270
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,969
It got filled up so fast

271
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,216
that we couldn't take
the children out any more

272
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,978
and they had to stay in their cells.

273
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,252
You feel bad for them holding a child

274
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,338
for no reason just 'cause 
of who your father was.

275
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,611
You can only make their stay
a little bit acceptable, I guess.

276
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,379
You give them all the candy from the MREs,

277
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,851
to make their time go by better, I guess.

278
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,609
But there's only so much you can do
or so much you could feel.

279
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,450
<i>"The lights went out in the prison,</i>

280
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,616
<i>"so here we are in the dark.</i>

281
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:15,409
<i>"I hear, 'Missus! Missus!'
I go downstairs and flash my light</i>

282
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,089
<i>"on a 16-year-old sitting down smacking ants.</i>

283
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,689
<i>"Now these ants are Iraqi ants. Large.</i>

284
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:33,575
<i>"So large they could carry the family dog
while giving you the finger.</i>

285
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,055
<i>"All the ants in the prison
came to this one boy's cell</i>

286
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,296
<i>"and decided to take over.</i>

287
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:42,698
<i>"All I could do was spray Lysol.
The ants laughed at me and kept going.</i>

288
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,536
<i>"So here we were in the dark
with one small flashlight,</i>

289
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,689
<i>"beating the ants with our shoes.</i>

290
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,729
<i>"So that was the start of my shift.</i>

291
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,898
<i>"They've been stripping
the fucked-up prisoners</i>

292
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,931
<i>"and handcuffing them to the bars.</i>

293
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,415
<i>"I get to laugh at them
and throw corn at them.</i>

294
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,373
<i>"I kind of feel bad for these guys,</i>

295
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,572
<i>"even if they are accused
of killing U.S. soldiers.</i>

296
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,455
<i>"We degrade them but we don't hit them,
and that's a plus.</i>

297
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:32,136
<i>"They sleep one hour, stay up for one hour 
then sleep one hour.</i>

298
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,612
<i>"This goes on for 72 hours
while we fuck with them.</i>

299
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:43,176
<i>"Most have been so scared
they piss on themselves. It's sad.</i>

300
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,932
<i>"Pictures were taken, 
you have to see them.</i>

301
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:58,339
<i>"A sandbag was put over their heads
while it was soaked in hot sauce.</i>

302
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,657
<i>"Okay, that's bad, but these guys have info.</i>

303
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,409
<i>"We were trying to get them to talk.
That's all."</i>

304
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,332
<i>The big word that always comes up 
for me is "surreal".</i>

305
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,736
<i>Everything that you saw,
everything that was going on.</i>

306
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,136
A bunch of unprofessional schmucks
that didn't know their damn job.

307
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,969
All thrown together,
mixed up with a big-ass stick,

308
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,172
and what you get out of it is the shit
you see on the news from Abu Ghraib.

309
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,890
It's disgusting. Pisses me off.

310
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,931
Because the whole time we're screwing around

311
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,574
and not doing the damn job,
Americans are dying.

312
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,055
<i>Abu G. had been hit by a mortar barrage,</i>

313
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,217
<i>killed two Americans
and wounded about 16.</i>

314
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,051
<i>We went to do an interrogation on the Wolf,</i>

315
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:02,731
<i>the cell leader of that group of people
that mortared the prison.</i>

316
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:07,058
<i>There was two female specialists,
one was an interrogator, one's an analyst.</i>

317
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:11,093
<i>They took all of his clothes off
and got him totally naked,</i>

318
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,415
<i>which we weren't supposed to do.</i>

319
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,253
When we got done with the interrogation,

320
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,178
I'm like, "So, what's the scoop
with the guy being naked?

321
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,576
"I mean, what's going on?"
Trying to think how they put it.

322
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,295
The Arab position on the females,
they're a subservient role in their culture.

323
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,648
And to try and break that down,

324
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,338
so they'll cooperate
with the female interrogator,

325
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,735
they interrogate him nude.

326
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,332
I went back and I asked my section sergeant.

327
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,416
And he's like,
"Yeah, we're not really supposed to do that,

328
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,974
"but we let the females
do some things like that,

329
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,614
"you know, to get over the Arab culture thing."

330
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,493
And I'm like, "You just said
we weren't supposed to be doing that."

331
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,613
And he's like, "Well, they're allowed to do it,
but you can't do it."

332
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,493
I said, "Okay. What am I supposed to do?"

333
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,329
And he's like, "Well, you know, if I was you,
I wouldn't be around that kind of stuff."

334
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,130
It's not like they were trying
to hide anything.

335
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,409
And that's what stands out to me,

336
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,536
is if you know you're doing 
something wrong, dead wrong,

337
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,695
you're gonna hide it.

338
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:25,450
You're gonna do your best to conceal it
so people that know better don't see it.

339
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:31,496
As I walk in,
here's a guy in his black PT shorts

340
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,293
and T shirt and shower shoes,

341
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,059
and there's another guy off
just with his pants and his shirt.

342
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,091
Each one had a naked detainee.

343
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,212
Someone says,
"We're MI. We know what we're doing."

344
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,854
And I'm like, "Okay."
You know, because I had no idea.

345
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,050
They're not wearing rank.
I don't know what rank these people are.

346
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:50,172
And they'll put their handcuffs above their head, 
stretch them out that way,

347
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,335
you know, stretch them out long.

348
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:55,533
Then they started handcuffing them together. 
I'm like...

349
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,049
The whole time they're yelling,
"Confess. Confess. Confess.

350
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,375
"You know you did it.
Tell us what you did. Confess."

351
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,979
Then they start handcuffing them into

352
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,649
what appeared to be
simulated sexual positions.

353
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,568
And, I'm just like.
I thought I had missed something.

354
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,611
Come to find out, what's going on is,

355
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,857
these guys were accused
of raping a teenager inside the jail.

356
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,130
No military intelligence value.

357
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,979
Cruz is yelling at him,
"Get undressed, get undressed!"

358
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,772
And the guy's like, "No, mister, no."

359
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,051
<i>So after they're undressed,
they throw water down on the floor</i>

360
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,216
<i>and they make them low crawl,</i>

361
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,849
<i>making him try to drag his genitals 
onto the concrete.</i>

362
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,579
<i>And I'm like, 
"What is going on here?"</i>

363
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,333
I said, "Is this the way
you all interrogate people?"

364
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,610
He goes, "There's a lots of different ways
we interrogate people."

365
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,013
<i>So I said, "I've had enough," and I left.</i>

366
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,289
The next morning,
the lieutenant's right out back.

367
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,298
I said, "Sir, military intelligence
over at the hard site.

368
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,218
"They are doing some pretty weird things
with naked detainees."

369
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,776
He told me I had no business
being over there.

370
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,494
And he also told me, 
"Stay out of MI's way and let them do their job."

371
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,415
Okay.

372
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:29,933
Okay, on the right, 
in black trunks, it's Cruz.

373
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,337
<i>Right next to him, myself.</i>

374
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:38,056
<i>To the left against the wall, Graner,</i>

375
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,169
<i>and we're looking at the two detainees
handcuffed on the floor.</i>

376
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,455
Can't see anything else, actually.

377
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,489
It was never intended as an interrogation.
It was never an interrogation.

378
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:15,011
The yelling was just for show, I believe.

379
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,731
<i>To show the spectators
this would be done to anybody</i>

380
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,532
<i>who breaks the rules.</i>

381
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:37,096
Abu Ghraib was mortared almost every day.
People were dying there.

382
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,135
So my frustration level was really high.

383
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,851
And when I heard about detainees
that raped a little boy,

384
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,016
I just completely went nuts.

385
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,017
Right before I left, I was so pissed off
that I had a bottle of water

386
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,450
and I splashed some of them
just to show, pretty much, my hate.

387
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,532
<i>At one point,
there was a Nerf ball brought in.</i>

388
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,970
<i>Everybody was throwing it to each other,
playing catch.</i>

389
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,936
<i>Here, I'm going to get it.</i>

390
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,417
<i>Once, I threw the ball,
it hit one of them in the leg, actually.</i>

391
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,691
<i>It's a Nerf ball,
so it can't bring any pain anyway.</i>

392
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,854
Graner wanted me to take some pictures.

393
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,370
He didn't tell me which ones to take
or not to take.

394
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:36,618
So I was just walking around, and...

395
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,015
"Just take one," you know?

396
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,210
MI came in and they got involved.
They wanted to mess with them, too.

397
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,696
They didn't like it
that they were raping the 15-year-old boy.

398
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:53,814
They were roughing them up,
having them run up and down the tier,

399
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,250
crawl, run into walls, stuff like that.

400
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,938
And then they handcuffed them together.

401
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:07,570
<i>That's Graner with his hands on his hips
and the gloves on his hands.</i>

402
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,531
<i>The two guys in the background</i>

403
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,053
<i>are the MI guys.</i>

404
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,729
They didn't wanna be in the pictures.
They were mad.

405
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:20,251
But I was like, "Well, hey, you know,
don't tell me. Whatever.

406
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,177
"Just taking pictures."

407
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,179
I'm not gonna even comment
on picture taking.

408
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,497
The whole time I was there
I didn't see any pictures being taken.

409
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:37,250
Even though I was in a few of them
I didn't see a flash or anything.

410
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:41,259
Because if I did
I would have said something to these guys.

411
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:45,339
First of all, there's a big sign,
"No photography".

412
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:49,089
And besides, photographing something 
like that is just stupid.

413
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:58,573
I received a 10 month sentence, 
a demotion to E1

414
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,055
and a bad conduct discharge.

415
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:05,810
I was more humiliated by that sentence
than actually punished.

416
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,500
Eight months in jail
for pouring water on somebody,

417
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:16,217
and throwing a Nerf ball at somebody.
That's humiliating. People laugh at that.

418
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,536
<i>So I go back home to my prison cell</i>

419
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:33,812
<i>and I got one of the terps, interpreter,
sitting outside waiting on me.</i>

420
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:37,774
And he's like, "Mr. Dugan, I'm so pissed.
I'm just so pissed. I'm pissed off.

421
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,370
"The general that you guys did,
he wanted to tell us where Izzat was."

422
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,774
<i>"Well, that's great."</i>

423
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,336
<i>And he's like, "No, the interrogator
wouldn't ask him where Izzat was."</i>

424
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,850
<i>He's the vice president of Iraq,
Saddam's number two guy.</i>

425
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,459
Ten times the general said,

426
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,810
"I'll tell you where Izzat is.
I'll tell you where Izzat is."

427
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,896
And then he never asked the question.

428
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:06,296
<i>He was standing just in front 
of his cell at attention.</i>

429
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,093
<i>I mean, he wasn't handcuffed or anything.</i>

430
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,575
<i>He was like a grandfather. 
Very respectful.</i>

431
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:22,014
<i>They shaved his eyebrows for some reason
and he was so upset.</i>

432
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:28,611
<i>And I told him not to worry,
that it made him look younger.</i>

433
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,129
<i>I just felt really bad for the guy.</i>

434
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:39,574
<i>Four days later, we were gonna do him
and the Army kid takes off the sandbag</i>

435
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,928
and the dude looks like Yoda.

436
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,494
I mean, he's got no eyebrows,
he's got no hair.

437
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,133
I'm like, "Who the hell is that?" You know.

438
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,569
And he's like,
"That's the freaking general," you know.

439
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,895
And I'm like, "Bullshit."
And I thought he was playing a joke on me.

440
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,772
"Damn it, I don't want this bullshit.

441
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,733
"I wanna do this guy, I wanna get this stuff. 
I want to find out fricking Izzat."

442
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,136
He's like, "This is the fricking general,
I'm not kidding you."

443
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,251
Never got him.

444
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,655
That general wouldn't say 
nothing else about it.

445
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:06,136
He had a serious resolve
that he wasn't gonna cooperate any more.

446
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:13,857
We got promoted from babysitters
to condition-setters.

447
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,494
We got implemented into the plan.

448
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,372
The military intelligence people
would come up there

449
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,378
and say, "Hey, play music at this time.
Play it loud.

450
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,412
"And if you got to, take the megaphone
and stick it right in front of the door.

451
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,612
"And turn it all the way up
so the guy can't pray,

452
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,699
"you know, he can't sleep.
Totally disorient him."

453
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,015
So I played this song called 
<i>Hip-Hop Hooray</i>

454
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,018
over and over and over again.

455
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,131
<i>Hip-hop hooray
Ho</i>

456
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,773
That's what it sounded like.

457
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,299
After a while, the Iraqis were saying...

458
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,456
<i>Hey, ho</i>

459
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,332
This is not working.

460
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:50,499
So, I changed it
and I put on heavy metal music.

461
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,497
I put on Metallica.

462
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,815
Like, <i>Enter the Sandman,</i>
this very loud song.

463
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,737
Then they were screaming like,
"I don't like it."

464
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:00,136
But after a while it didn't...
They were numb to that.

465
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,775
I guess they were so deaf from the guitar,
the A chord,

466
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,893
that they were able to, you know, sleep.
Go figure.

467
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:11,649
I put in country music.
That worked. They couldn't stand it.

468
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:15,489
They're like, "Oh my God, Allah. Allah."
You know, "Cut it off."

469
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:19,056
By the time the interrogators would come
to take them out the cells

470
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:22,456
they were more than ready to go.
Like, "Please take me."

471
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,059
Sometimes MI would come in,

472
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,455
say, "Hey, we're gonna interrogate
this guy today.

473
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:31,255
"Get him out and you can start...
soften him up a little bit."

474
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,575
Scream at him, yell at him, 
make him do PT.

475
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,612
Handcuff him in a awkward position for a while.

476
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,334
Completely strip him 
and have a female do it,

477
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:43,089
because that would embarrass the person
or humiliate them even more.

478
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,611
We didn't kill them.
We didn't cut their heads off.

479
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,658
We didn't shoot them.

480
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,692
We didn't cut them
and let them bleed to death.

481
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,458
We just did what we were told,
to soften them up for interrogation.

482
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,730
And we were told
to do anything short of killing them.

483
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,772
We would make them stand
in awkward positions

484
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,610
for hours at a time to stress them out
and to strain them.

485
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:12,050
And we would have them crawl 
up and down the tier.

486
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,579
We'd pour cold water on them.

487
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:18,136
Point at him and laugh at him
while he was in the shower naked.

488
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,376
Shower him with all his clothes on.

489
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,129
Cut off all his clothes with a knife.

490
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,615
Burn him with a cigarette.

491
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,812
We'd just do what they want us to do.

492
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,694
If they want us to PT the guy
that's what we do.

493
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,459
If they want us to keep him up,
that's what we do.

494
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,219
They say, "I want him to be awake."

495
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:43,458
They say, "He's dirty.
I want him to shower a lot."

496
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,855
Did any of this seem weird?

497
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,892
Not when you take into account
that we're being told

498
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:55,653
that that's helping to save lives
and you see that people are coming in

499
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:59,932
from right outside the wire
with their body parts missing,

500
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:04,690
and they need to know
who's doing it so they can stop it.

501
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,129
And these are your battle buddies.

502
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:09,332
Gilligan was the one on the box
with the wires.

503
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,099
He was accused of killing two CID agents.

504
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:32,696
<i>It was his box.
He had to hold it, he had to stand on it.</i>

505
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:36,730
It was cold so he had a blanket on.

506
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,654
I mean, he was never physically
ever touched that I saw.

507
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,850
He was just very, very tired.

508
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:55,650
<i>He kept giving us different names,
so Graner nicknamed him "Gilligan."</i>

509
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:09,375
<i>When I got there he was in the shower.
There was wires on his fingers</i>

510
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,809
<i>and he was told he would be electrocuted
if he fell off.</i>

511
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,693
<i>There was no electricity
going through the wires</i>

512
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:21,449
<i>and to say, "Hey, if you fall off
you're gonna be electrocuted."</i>

513
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:25,858
<i>I mean, that would keep anybody awake.
So, it was part of the sleep plan.</i>

514
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,696
<i>You had to keep him awake.</i>

515
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,650
<i>It would have been meaner
if there was electricity</i>

516
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,169
<i>and he really could be electrocuted.</i>

517
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,412
<i>It was just words.</i>

518
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:53,058
<i>The wires were taken off
after photos were taken.</i>

519
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:09,209
<i>You'll see Sergeant Frederick in it.
That's the one I took.</i>

520
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:15,692
<i>And the one where 
I'm outside the shower looking in.</i>

521
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,333
<i>I took that one.</i>

522
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:36,216
He became one of our workers
so he was let out, like, every day.

523
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:41,858
He was, like... He's kind of fun.
But I think it was proven he was innocent.

524
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,898
We'd give him an extra meal for helping out
and cigarettes, that kind of stuff.

525
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:53,811
He was about 25. 24, 25.
Young guy. Pretty decent.

526
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,689
<i>Each of the pictures had file time stamps</i>

527
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:09,848
but they were all off anywhere
from a year plus to a couple hours.

528
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:13,850
And every time they got copied to a CD
from one computer to another,

529
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,369
the times would change
based on that computer's time setting.

530
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,816
<i>But the one time setting
that did stay constant</i>

531
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,817
<i>is what we call metadata.</i>

532
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:30,210
<i>Metadata's a big, two-dollar word
for information about information.</i>

533
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,258
<i>Pictures have information inside the file</i>

534
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,498
<i>that tells you about
when that file was created,</i>

535
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:44,614
<i>what software created it,
the exposure settings,</i>

536
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,492
<i>and the date and time
that the camera thought it was</i>

537
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,497
<i>when it took the picture.</i>

538
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:53,689
<i>I was really elated to see
that the metadata was still intact.</i>

539
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:02,657
<i>The three main cameras belonged to
Graner, Harman and Frederick.</i>

540
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:07,376
<i>Graner's camera, the Sony FD Mavica,
that took most of the pictures.</i>

541
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:12,250
<i>There was a Sony Cybershot,
I believe belonged to Harman.</i>

542
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:18,489
<i>And Deluxe Classic Cam,
which belonged to Frederick.</i>

543
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:29,134
<i>I then realised that these people
were actually taking pictures</i>

544
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,650
<i>of the exact same incident
almost at the exact same time.</i>

545
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,897
<i>Found a total of eight separate 
time-synch incidents</i>

546
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,818
<i>where I could say,
"This camera thought it was this time.</i>

547
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:42,374
<i>"This camera thought it was that time."</i>

548
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,573
<i>Once I was able to adjust it,
all the pictures just seemed to line up.</i>

549
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,772
<i>There was a guard log</i>

550
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:56,615
<i>where they recorded incidences
that occurred at the jail.</i>

551
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,937
<i>It actually confirmed
the time line was accurate.</i>

552
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:06,336
<i>Sabrina Harman's camera
thought it was 2002.</i>

553
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:11,534
<i>I had to adjust her camera one year,
nine months, 11 hours, 29 minutes.</i>

554
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:17,139
<i>Frederick's and Graner's 
were only seven or eight hours off.</i>

555
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:44,250
Nobody really got any intelligence there.
Very few of us.

556
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:48,089
Most of our interrogators
were 18-year-old kids that are reservists.

557
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:53,852
And if you think about it,
you got a 45 to a 65-year-old,

558
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:58,329
one, two, or three, or four-star general
that you're gonna be talking to.

559
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,736
And you're 18 years old,
just got out of high school, joined the Army,

560
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,737
and went through interrogator school.

561
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,851
What the hell are you gonna ask
that 55-year-old general,

562
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:10,531
that's seen the world,
done everything and been everywhere?

563
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:13,220
You know, these kids are intimidated as hell.

564
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,410
And the generals and the colonels
and these older guys know it.

565
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,690
And it's like, they laugh at them.

566
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:25,537
<i>So I'm working this guy,
not getting crap out of him.</i>

567
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:29,653
<i>His brother was also captured with him.
So I went into the hallway</i>

568
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:34,217
<i>and decided I'd see 
what was going on with his brother.</i>

569
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:38,413
<i>There's six interrogation booths,
and each one has a two-way mirror,</i>

570
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:41,850
<i>so you can view what's going on
with the interrogation.</i>

571
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:47,930
<i>You got an Army female and an Army male
playing grab-ass</i>

572
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,620
<i>and not asking the detainee questions.</i>

573
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:53,732
<i>There was a guy coming on to a girl
and a girl being receptive,</i>

574
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:57,170
<i>when they're supposed to be
interrogating this schmuck.</i>

575
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:02,657
<i>And I said,
"Hey, why don't we, like, switch guys?"</i>

576
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:08,090
So this new detainee's in my booth
and I say,

577
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,939
"Listen. I've been sitting here for two hours,

578
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,459
"and I've actually been sitting here
for two days

579
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,332
"'cause I was standing outside a two-way mirror

580
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,371
"watching you with the other guys, okay?

581
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,013
"I know you know all kinds of crap.

582
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:19,653
"And I know that you're pulling 
a lot of bullshit

583
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:20,815
"on these Army kids."

584
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,091
I said, "I'm not gonna put up
with your bullshit, okay?

585
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:27,735
"It takes me three minutes and 47 seconds
to smoke this cigarette.

586
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:30,454
"I'm gonna go outside,
I'm gonna smoke this cigarette,

587
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,899
"and when I come back in,

588
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,456
"you're gonna tell me every damn thing
I wanna know. You understand me?"

589
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,969
I said, "Do I look like
I'm in the fricking Army to you?"

590
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:52,009
<i>And I put my fist through the plastic table
and I went outside to smoke my cigarette.</i>

591
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,409
<i>Then after about a minute and a half,</i>

592
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,849
<i>there was crying and yelling
coming out of my booth.</i>

593
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,857
<i>And my terp was standing near the doorway</i>

594
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,652
and he's like,
"You scared the shit out of this guy.

595
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:03,815
"He don't know what you're gonna do.

596
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:06,773
"He'll tell you anything you want.
I mean, whatever you want to talk about."

597
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:10,017
So I walked back in there real calm
and I sat down in the corner

598
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,654
and I said, "So, what's your decision?"

599
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,415
<i>My prisons were spread all over the place,</i>

600
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,175
<i>so I was on the road quite a bit.</i>

601
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:33,535
One time I arrived down at Abu Ghraib
and Lieutenant Wood said to me,

602
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:36,572
"Oh, ma'am, we have an interrogation going on.

603
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,816
"Would you like to come over and see it?"

604
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,818
She took me over there and we stood
in the hallway and I observed it,

605
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,090
and it looked perfectly normal.

606
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,977
I've wondered many times

607
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:52,094
if they didn't take me in there specifically
so I would be able to say,

608
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:55,576
"Yes, I saw an interrogation, and, yes, 
it looked perfectly normal."

609
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:02,816
It's kind of funny how when, say,
General Karpinski or some other big shot

610
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:09,292
would come look at the prison, we'd...
you know, have a dog-and-pony show.

611
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:13,578
And everybody would get 
their mattresses back.

612
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,691
Everybody would get their clothes back.

613
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,050
And then as soon as the people left,

614
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:22,935
whoever was deprived of certain things
got deprived of it again.

615
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,858
That just seemed normal
to deprive people of something

616
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,414
if they're not cooperating with you.

617
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,818
<i>CIA, Iraqi Survey Group,</i>

618
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,089
<i>DIA, FBI,</i>

619
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,219
<i>Task Force 121,</i>

620
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,652
<i>the other government agencies,
that's what we called it, the OGA.</i>

621
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,375
<i>They had no rules.</i>

622
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,059
<i>We called them the ghosts
'cause they'd come in,</i>

623
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,613
<i>you don't know who they are.</i>

624
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:53,698
<i>Whoever their prisoners were,
you never logged them.</i>

625
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,739
"How's it going there, soldier?

626
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,772
"You know, here's this guy,
don't log him in the book.

627
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:02,619
"He's not here, hasn't been here.

628
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:05,618
"Just put him in a cell in there and, 
you know, don't mark it.

629
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:08,812
"When the Red Cross comes here,
move them another place.

630
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,976
"When the Red Cross goes

00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,773
"move them back to where they were.
You know, 'cause they don't exist here."

632
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,533
I'm used to being out in the road, you know.

633
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:19,252
"Hey, soldiers, go do this."

634
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:22,929
"Roger that, sergeant, airborne.
See you later, we're done."

635
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:26,655
But now we're a part
of this big high-profile operation.

636
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:29,374
You know, we're getting, like,
the deck-of-card guys,

637
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,060
the guys who were on the deck of cards.
We're getting them.

638
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:37,095
Like, whoa, we have a big job.
Wow, we got to guard these guys now?

639
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,691
<i>That's when things changed.</i>

640
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:02,138
<i>They'd take them into the shower room,
put a sheet up over the door,</i>

641
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:06,411
<i>stick them underneath the shower spigot.</i>

642
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:12,456
<i>Or stick them in the garbage pails 
with the ice. Then have at it.</i>

643
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,369
<i>A burlap sack on their head,</i>

644
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:29,335
<i>the wetness, it's sticking to your nose,
sticking to your mouth.</i>

645
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:32,258
<i>Makes them feel like they're drowning.</i>

646
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:34,940
<i>Open a window while it's, like, 
40 degrees outside</i>

647
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:37,699
<i>and watch them disappear into themselves.</i>

648
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:47,131
For hours and hours and hours,
all you would hear is screaming, banging.

649
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:51,458
When they were done, eight, ten hours later,
they'd bring their guy out.

650
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:56,176
They'd be halfway coherent or unconscious.

651
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:59,531
Put them back in their cell, and then,
"We'll be back for them tomorrow."

652
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:05,136
I know what it sounds like to hear,
you know, skin smacked or punched.

653
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,137
I know the difference
between someone screaming

654
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,659
because they're upset

655
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,214
and then someone screaming
because they're in pain.

656
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,535
You know, I know the difference.

657
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,253
<i>It was early in the morning,</i>

658
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:25,417
like 4:30, around that time,
so everything was silent.

659
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:29,533
OGAs were, "Okay, we have 
another special prisoner here."

660
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,696
He was wearing only a shirt.

661
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:38,289
So he came in, he was shackled, 
handcuffed and everything, with a hood on.

662
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,213
When he came in, we didn't ask,

663
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:45,777
we didn't ask nobody who this guy was,
what he did. That wasn't our business.

664
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:52,809
<i>Two soldiers took him
straight to the shower,</i>

665
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:55,818
<i>where he was interrogated by one OGA.</i>

666
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:00,168
<i>He was there quite a while.</i>

667
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:03,292
<i>I think he was there
about an hour and a half.</i>

668
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:10,411
<i>All of a sudden,
the OGA guy opened the door and said,</i>

669
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,417
<i>"Can you help me here?</i>

670
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:16,533
"Tie him a little higher
'cause he don't want to cooperate now.

671
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:18,810
"He's, I guess..."

672
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,374
You know, he was just sagging.

673
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:27,609
There were some CIA guys there. 
I think they were CIA. Well, yeah, they were.

674
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:32,336
But at the time,
we didn't know what agency they were with.

675
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:36,499
They asked us to handcuff him to the window, 
so he has to hold himself up

676
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:40,499
'cause he was playing possum.
Now I'm just holding him by the jumpsuit.

677
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:44,374
I'm not holding him
under the arms or anything.

678
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,377
And his jumpsuit is riding up his crotch

679
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:50,535
and I commented and said, you know,

680
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:52,816
"Damn, this guy's pretty good
at playing possum."

681
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,295
'Cause I know I'd be howling 
like a, you know,

682
00:52:55,420 --> 00:53:00,096
whatever with this riding up my crotch
like his jumpsuit was.

683
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:03,132
Everybody just kind of laughed
and nobody really thought anything of it.

684
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:07,173
And I remember how, like,
far back his arms were going

685
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,337
and it was just a really awkward position.

686
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:15,693
Again, you know, I was like,
"You know, this guy's pretty damn good

687
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:18,493
"'cause, you know,
his arms are almost about to break.

688
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:22,533
"I'm surprised they haven't broken.
I'm waiting for the pop."

689
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:25,049
And then all of a sudden, 
just like, I guess,

690
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,740
blood started pouring 
out of his nose and mouth.

691
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:30,852
And so we realised something was,
you know, was wrong.

692
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:37,054
That's when I went and raised the hood.
And that's the first time I saw his face.

693
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:42,299
I was surprised 'cause his face 
was totally messed up.

694
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:47,494
He got huge black eyes
with bruises everywhere.

695
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:50,896
And I was like,
"Whoa, what happened to this guy?"

696
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,898
And then one of his eye was open.

697
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:59,936
So I kind of, like, did the thing like Pierce
so he could move his eyes.

698
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:02,620
And nothing.
He was just looking down like this.

699
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:07,291
And I was, "Whoa, this guy's...
this guy is not even alive."

700
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,491
<i>This whole time
we were messing with this guy,</i>

701
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:21,612
<i>you know, carrying him and lifting him,</i>

702
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:24,254
<i>and this entire time the guy was dead.</i>

703
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:34,453
<i>I even got some blood on my uniform
'cause he was dripping.</i>

704
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:42,292
It kind of felt bad, you know, 'cause I'm like,
I know I'm not part of this, but, you know...

705
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:47,731
But it kind of make you feel like you are
'cause you're there with the guy.

706
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:53,532
Colonel Jordan, he was in charge of the MIs,

707
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:58,051
he came in, the medics came in,
Captain Reese came in,

708
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:02,093
Captain Brinson, the first sergeant,
Sergeant Snider, everybody showed up.

709
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:05,132
You had the entire chain of command
right there,

710
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,488
trying to figure out what was going on.

711
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:11,616
We checked him and, you know,
sure enough he had died.

712
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:16,256
And we kind of...

713
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,213
I don't know, I walked out of the room,
just kind of like, you know...

714
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:26,017
You know, like nothing happened.
And then I asked one of the CIA agents,

715
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:28,779
you know, I was like,
"Well, what do you guys normally do

716
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,049
"in a situation like this?"

717
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:32,614
They were kind of, not panicky,

718
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:37,530
but, you know,
they were on their phones calling,

719
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:40,493
whoever, to see how to, you know, 
see what to do or what not.

720
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:45,496
<i>Well, what do we do with him?</i>

721
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:49,169
<i>We can't take him out in a body bag
'cause that may start a riot.</i>

722
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:56,417
<i>So we had to keep him there overnight.
And so we got a body bag.</i>

723
00:55:56,540 --> 00:56:00,977
<i>We got a bunch of ice. 
Iced him down.</i>

724
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:06,735
<i>Left him in the room where he was at.
And then we shut and locked the door.</i>

725
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:28,250
I remember saying to the NCO,

726
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:31,019
"You need to take the spare key
and hold on to it,

727
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:34,496
"or someone will probably go in there and, 
you know, mess with him."

728
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:36,417
We should have just taken both keys

729
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,338
and held on to them
instead of leaving one there.

730
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,690
But I guess he, you know,
had to leave one there,

731
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:46,257
in case they wanted to come 
take the body that night or something.

732
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:49,858
<i>It was pretty much supposed to be,
you know, hush-hush.</i>

733
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,448
<i>Didn't want the word to spread around.</i>

734
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:02,248
<i>"It was a crazy day yesterday.
The guy they brought in died.</i>

735
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:07,531
<i>"He was beat pretty bad.
I'm not sure what happened.</i>

736
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:09,855
<i>"It was on the shift before us.</i>

737
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:15,777
<i>"They stuck him in a room 
next to where I was working last night</i>

738
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:20,894
<i>"and put him in a body bag on ice.
How fucking gross.</i>

739
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,658
<i>"He's already been defrosting for 24 hours."</i>

740
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:36,099
Captain Brinson had a meeting
in the main office with all of us.

741
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:40,054
And he said that there was a prisoner
who had died in the shower

742
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:41,374
and he died of a heart attack.

743
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:54,648
<i>Sergeant Frederick got the key,
and we just checked him out.</i>

744
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:07,096
<i>He started to melt, 
and it started to smell.</i>

745
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:13,855
<i>He was there for at least 
24 hours prior to us getting there.</i>

746
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:16,574
<i>So he was there for a pretty long time.</i>

747
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:46,056
<i>His knees were bruised,
his thighs were bruised by his genitals.</i>

748
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:48,569
<i>He had restraint marks on his wrists.</i>

749
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:54,170
It was kind of obvious,
after you just kept looking,

750
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:57,258
that there was no way
he died of a heart attack.

751
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:20,218
<i>You've gotten into trouble
because of the thumb.</i>

752
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:24,332
<i>I can understand. 
It does look really bad.</i>

753
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:28,658
<i>But whenever I would get into a photo,
I never know what to do with my hands.</i>

754
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,370
Any kind of photo,
I probably have a thumbs-up,

755
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:35,937
'cause it's just something
that automatically happens.

756
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,096
Like when you get into a photo,
you wanna smile.

757
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:42,418
It's just, I guess, something I did.

758
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:52,417
He was a ghost detainee,
so he wasn't supposed to be there.

759
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:55,134
They didn't want him to be in there
when the Red Cross came,

760
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,739
so we had to do something.

761
00:59:56,860 --> 01:00:02,218
So someone came up with the idea
to take him out of the body bag,

762
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:06,174
dress him in the orange jumpsuit,
put his dead body on a gurney,

763
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:11,658
stick a IV in his dead arm
and take him out of the facility.

764
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:17,174
<i>From that point on,
we never heard anything of it. It was just...</i>

765
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:21,532
<i>The guy died, they put him in a body bag,
put him on a gurney, he was gone.</i>

766
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:26,176
<i>Go about your business, keep working.
Disappeared. He dissolved into thin air.</i>

767
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:32,570
They tried to charge me
with destruction of government property,

768
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,179
which I don't understand,

769
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:38,498
and then maltreatment of taking 
the photos of a dead guy.

770
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:40,929
But he's dead.
I don't know how that's maltreatment.

771
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:42,857
And then altering evidence,

772
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:47,132
for removing the bandage from his eye
to take a photo of it

773
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:49,057
and then I placed it back.

774
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:52,650
When he died, they cleaned him all up
and then stuck the bandages on.

775
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:55,817
So it's not really altering evidence.
They had already done that for me.

776
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:59,410
In order to make the other charges stick,
they were gonna have to bring in the photos,

777
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:03,135
which they didn't want to bring up
the dead guy at all, the OGA,

778
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:07,219
'cause obviously they covered up a murder
and that would just make them look bad.

779
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:11,618
So they dropped all the charges
pertaining to the OGA in the shower.

780
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:33,211
Camp Ganci had a huge riot.

781
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:34,978
It was a female MP.

782
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:38,456
She got smashed in the face with, like,
a cinder block or something like that.

783
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:41,617
They were gonna break out
of the tent encampments,

784
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,651
get the MPs, and hold them hostage.

785
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:46,340
We brought them down the hallway,
put them on the floor.

786
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,815
That's where I come in.

787
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:50,737
I can't go to sleep at night,

788
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:53,897
worrying about the detainees
trying to kill me

789
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:56,250
when I got people outside the walls
trying to kill me.

790
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,211
This has got to stop.
These guys are gonna have to...

791
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,649
They got to know. So I lost it.

792
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:03,851
Threw the guys on the floor,
I fell on the pile,

793
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:09,134
did like a WWF, you know,
just jumped on them a little bit.

794
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:11,774
I wanted to do more, I was mad.

795
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:14,334
I'm like,"You done hurt one of our soldiers, 
like, that's it."

796
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:16,815
So I stepped on the finger,
stepped on the guy's finger,

797
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:18,373
stepped on the guy's toe.

798
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:21,060
I wanted to hurt him,

799
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:23,136
the gentleman who hit the female in the face
with the brick.

800
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:24,693
I wanted to hurt him really bad.

801
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:30,651
I finished my day in the motor pool
and I had generator detail that night.

802
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:35,410
Just sitting there at night,
it gets very boring.

803
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:39,374
Computer system was very slow.
I was waiting for e-mail to come up.

804
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:43,776
And Sergeant Frederick walked in.
He had to print out some papers and stuff.

805
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:46,539
And we started talking.
He got a call on the radio

806
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:48,855
that he had some individuals
he had to in-process.

807
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:51,016
He said, "Come on,
you walk down to the holding cell with me."

808
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:54,809
So I walked down with him.
And they had the seven individuals there.

809
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:56,737
And I said, "Hey, Freddy,

810
01:02:56,860 --> 01:03:00,853
"you want me to grab one of the detainees
and take him down for you?"

811
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,095
He said, "Yeah, go ahead."

812
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:05,895
And as I'm getting closer to Tier 1 Alpha,
I could hear Graner yelling.

813
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:08,580
And I'm like,
"Where do you guys want him?"

814
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,372
They said, "Just put him on the floor."

815
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,810
So I pushed him onto the floor
with the other guys.

816
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:19,173
And that's when all the pictures and stuff 
started happening.

817
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:23,930
That's when Javal was stepping on the fingers 
and stuff and on the toes,

818
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:26,016
and Lynndie was also.

819
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:27,619
And that's when all the pictures started

820
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:31,016
and Graner asked me
to take the staged photo,

821
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:36,612
of him with the one detainee
where he was cradling the detainee's head,

822
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:39,049
and he was acting
like he was gonna strike the detainee.

823
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:45,656
<i>Never struck him.</i>

824
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:49,295
<i>As soon as I took the photograph,
he laid the detainee down.</i>

825
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:57,138
And then they start
the stripping of the detainees

826
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:00,098
and taking more photographs.

827
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:05,010
Graner walks over to one of the detainees,
punches him in the temple,

828
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:07,608
for what reason, I don't know.

829
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:10,891
I mean, hits the detainee hard.

830
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:16,933
And, after he does that,
Sabrina matches up the numbers,

831
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:20,530
says, "This guy's in here for rape."

832
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:26,450
So Graner rips the leg open 
on the jumpsuit that he had.

833
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:29,014
<i>Sabrina writes, 
"I am a rapeist," on him.</i>

834
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:35,695
The guy hasn't moved for, like, 
two or three minutes.

835
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:37,538
I kind of look at him and I said,

836
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:41,335
"Hey, Grane, something's wrong with that guy."

837
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:46,488
And I walked over and I lifted the sandbag,
up to where I could see his eyes.

838
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:51,614
The guy was unconscious. I said,
"Graner, you knocked that dude out."

839
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:54,459
And he kind of shook his...

840
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:56,218
And after he punched him,
he kind of shook his hand

841
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:58,774
and he said, 
"Ouch! Damn, that hurt."

842
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:05,094
And he didn't seem too concerned about it.

843
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:09,498
And then I walked back over by Freddy.
We were standing there.

844
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:13,659
And Freddy looks at me and he says, 
"Hey, watch this."

845
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:16,817
Goes over, gets the guy
that I escorted down,

846
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:24,689
lifts the guy up, marks an "X" on his chest,
punches the guy right square in the chest.

847
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:27,933
I'm like, "What?

848
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:34,298
"Who are you and 
what did you do with Freddy?"

849
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:42,330
<i>Then they started the whole,
one facing the wall on his knees</i>

850
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:45,054
<i>and setting the other one on top of him.</i>

851
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:53,729
<i>They had flex-cuffs, which are, 
more or less, big zip ties.</i>

852
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,850
<i>And I told Graner,
"This guy's gonna lose his hands</i>

853
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:02,211
<i>"if we don't get them off of him.
I mean, they're purple."</i>

854
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:05,491
<i>I said, "Well, I got my Gerber on me.
I can probably get them with that,</i>

855
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:08,612
<i>"but we're gonna have to stand him up."</i>

856
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:11,891
<i>It took a little while,
but I finally got them off of him</i>

857
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:14,011
<i>and then the blood started flowing back
in his hands.</i>

858
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:16,938
<i>And as far as I know,
the guy kept his hands.</i>

859
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:23,211
That's when Graner and Freddy
started with the human pyramid thing.

860
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:26,571
Graner told me that he was doing
what he was told,

861
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:30,458
that's why he was doing it.

862
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:34,892
And as I was leaving the tier that night,
I was told that I didn't see shit.

863
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:40,333
And me being the person that I am,
I try to be friends with everybody.

864
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:43,577
I said, "See what? I didn't see nothing."

865
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:47,696
I was always asked by CID,

866
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:55,019
"Why didn't you report this?
Didn't I feel that it was morally wrong?"

867
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:58,337
I said, "Yes, but when you're in war,
things change."

868
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:03,731
We were told, "No pictures of prisoners."

869
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:07,091
I was asked to take it.
I'm a nice guy, so I took it.

870
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:12,657
I try not to have anybody mad at me.
That's the way I've always been.

871
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:19,929
But I guess being a nice guy
doesn't always pay off.

872
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:27,216
Some people ask me now
why I'm not as nice as what I used to be.

873
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:29,490
I say, "Put yourself in my shoes.

874
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:32,612
"Go through what I've went through
in the last two and half, three years.

875
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:34,617
"See how nice you'll be."

876
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:41,499
<i>Sivits just happened to stick around
for maybe five minutes.</i>

877
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:46,294
<i>I mean, he never hurt anyone.</i>

878
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:57,012
<i>He got a year in jail for nothing.
Just for being there.</i>

879
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:03,253
<i>He shouldn't have got any time at all.</i>

880
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:08,092
<i>I don't think he would've even been charged
if he wasn't in that video.</i>

881
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:13,331
- Who took the video?
- I did.

882
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:19,495
The last thing I remember
was one guy standing

883
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:21,053
and one guy kneeling.

884
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:25,492
And the one guy had his hand
on the other guy's head.

885
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:28,088
And that's the last photo that I took.

886
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:32,215
<i>Then we left to go use the phones.</i>

887
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:36,736
<i>It was Kelly's birthday,
so I went to make a phone call.</i>

888
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:44,816
Me and Megan were still upstairs
in the office.

889
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:48,728
And we walked out
and they were throwing them into a dogpile,

890
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:53,134
<i>and taking pictures from the top tier.</i>

891
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:56,569
<i>About that time,
raner and Davis and Frederick</i>

892
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:59,373
<i>started jumping on the dogpile.</i>

893
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:02,219
<i>And that's when I went downstairs
with a camera.</i>

894
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:05,332
<i>Graner said he wanted some taken 
down there, too.</i>

895
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:11,250
<i>Me, Freddy and Sabrina
were taking pictures,</i>

896
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:13,735
<i>three different cameras that night.</i>

897
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:27,051
<i>They were lined up against the wall,
and Graner started taking them one by one.</i>

898
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:32,615
<i>We didn't know what he was doing.</i>

899
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:37,131
<i>Nobody knew. 
He didn't say anything.</i>

900
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:40,616
<i>And then he told us
that he was piling them in a pyramid.</i>

901
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:44,853
<i>And we're like, "Okay, why?"</i>

902
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:48,689
<i>He's like, "To control them,
so they're all in one area."</i>

903
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:52,092
<i>So we're like, "Okay."</i>

904
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:56,730
Freddy is the one
that started them masturbating.

905
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:58,259
I don't know why, but he did.

906
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:02,771
He started the one, and then he wanted to see 
if the others would do it too, I guess.

907
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,458
I don't know.

908
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:06,411
But he had them all doing it
at the same time.

909
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:18,977
<i>At one point, six of the guys stopped,</i>

910
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:23,218
and the one guy kept doing it
for like 45 minutes.

911
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:26,329
No joke.

912
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:33,258
The one guy that was still masturbating,
that was the one picture with me in it.

913
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:35,132
He wanted me in it,
and I didn't want to be in it.

914
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:36,932
I was like, "I'm not going over there."

915
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:39,893
- Who wanted you in it?
- Freddy.

916
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:43,698
And then Graner joined in.
Graner was like, "Yeah, just come on."

917
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:45,458
I was like,
"No, I don't want to go over there."

918
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:49,368
And he's like, "Come on, just do it for me,"
and this and that. And I'm like, "Fine."

919
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,097
<i>Was this your birthday?</i>

920
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:03,658
They brought them in after midnight.
So, yeah.

921
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:12,014
- Which birthday?
- 21st.

922
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:18,252
I had heard Graner saying,
"Well, this is your birthday present,"

923
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:21,452
or something, and I'm like...

924
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:23,298
I don't know why he would have said it

925
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:27,493
'cause I really wouldn't have wanted that,
but, yeah.

926
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:29,451
I mean, he used me.

927
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:31,457
And even though I was stupid enough
to fall for it.

928
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:34,140
I mean, now I'll know what to look for.

929
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:37,936
Least he's moved on past me.

930
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:49,248
<i>This was the infamous
seven-man naked-Iraqi stacking.</i>

931
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:54,296
<i>The facial expressions 
kind of set the tone</i>

932
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:58,049
<i>for what they were thinking
and feeling at the time.</i>

933
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:02,412
<i>You look in their eyes,
and it looked like they're having fun.</i>

934
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:04,974
<i>This scene is what sealed their fate.</i>

935
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:10,691
Pretty much everybody that participated
is in the photograph at one time or another.

936
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:15,930
<i>Here you see Graner in a punching motion.</i>

937
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:18,494
<i>Two cameras actually caught him
at the exact same time</i>

938
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:21,009
<i>from two totally different angles.</i>

939
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:26,650
<i>And again you see it where they had
the seven men stacked naked</i>

940
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:28,975
<i>with the hoods over their heads.</i>

941
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:35,414
<i>You actually see both of the cameras
inside each of the pictures.</i>

942
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:46,771
It's not so much that you're there
committing these acts of abuse.

943
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:48,970
If you're in the pictures
while this stuff was going on,

944
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:52,092
- you were gonna be in trouble.
- Big trouble.

945
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:57,332
If you make our President apologise
to the world, I would say so, yeah.

946
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:07,099
<i>"I haven't slept all night. I just can't sleep.
Six prisoners escaped last night.</i>

947
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:12,169
<i>"That's eight we've lost in three nights.
Something bad is going to happen here.</i>

948
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:15,736
<i>"I hope I'm wrong,
but if not, know I love you.</i>

949
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:22,169
<i>"We might be under investigation.
There's talk about it.</i>

950
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:31,132
<i>"Yes, they do beat the prisoners.
I don't think it's right and never have.</i>

951
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:36,970
<i>"That's why I take the pictures
to prove the story I tell people.</i>

952
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:43,689
<i>"No one would ever believe the shit
that goes on. No one.</i>

953
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:48,697
<i>"If I want to keep taking pictures
of these events,</i>

954
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:51,209
<i>"I have to fake a smile every time.</i>

955
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:57,133
<i>"I hope I do not get into trouble
for something that I haven't done.</i>

956
01:15:01,820 --> 01:15:04,050
<i>"I love you. Sabrina."</i>

957
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:12,613
I guess reality hit
that what was going on wasn't right,

958
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:14,253
which, of course,
you know from the beginning,

959
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:19,215
but then it's your job.
I mean, there's really nothing.

960
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:21,774
You can't just walk away and say,
"Hey, I'm not coming back,"

961
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:23,413
or "I'm not doing this."

962
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:26,293
'Cause either way,
you're gonna get screwed.

963
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:08,653
We had an Iraqi prison guard
smuggle in a pistol, a 9mm,

964
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:10,657
and a brand-new bayonet.

965
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:13,499
The prison guard wrapped it up in a sheet,

966
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:16,651
<i>shimmied it up to a cell.</i>

967
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:21,493
<i>The detainee went underneath his pillow,
pulled out a 9mm,</i>

968
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:28,655
<i>hit Sarge Cathcart in the vest.</i>

969
01:16:41,660 --> 01:16:44,458
<i>Sergeant Elliot 
had to stick the shotgun inside</i>

970
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:48,334
<i>to get the guy to stop shooting.
And all he hit him in was his leg,</i>

971
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:53,329
<i>'cause he was in the corner praying, like,
"Allah, Allah." And he was willing to die.</i>

972
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:20,900
<i>All the Iraqi prison guards
that were involved,</i>

973
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:25,616
<i>they rounded them all up and fired some,
but the Iraqis hired them right back.</i>

974
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:32,258
Not only did you have to risk your life
from the shelling on the outside,

975
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:33,369
you was risking your life

976
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:37,857
dealing with the unscreened 
Iraqi corrections guards.

977
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:40,175
You know. And the detainees.

978
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:44,373
So strike one, two and three.
One of them is going to take you out.

979
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:49,255
Not all of them were bad,
but a vast majority were bad.

980
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:51,177
The guy who smuggled in the pistol,

981
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:54,258
I thought was a good guy.
I thought was a good guard.

982
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:58,134
He turned out to be Fedayeen.
Smile in your face, stab you in the back.

983
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:03,413
They rushed in right away
and took care of this guy

984
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:06,418
who had just tried to kill us. So...

985
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:13,530
But it doesn't appear when you see a picture
that that's what happened.

986
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:34,538
<i>Your imagination can run wild
when you just see blood.</i>

987
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:42,094
<i>The pictures only show you
a fraction of a second.</i>

988
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:44,609
<i>You don't see forward
and you don't see backward.</i>

989
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:46,970
<i>You don't see outside the frame.</i>

990
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:14,295
<i>"This is the first time I've seen 
military police dogs here.</i>

991
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:19,016
<i>"Two dogs with two owners
go to the man against the wall.</i>

992
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:25,693
<i>"The guy is scared out of his mind.
The dogs get closer.</i>

993
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:30,374
<i>"The Iraqi starts screaming
and runs straight to Graner.</i>

994
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:36,291
<i>"And one of the guys lets his dog 
loose enough to bite him in the leg.</i>

995
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:40,015
<i>"The guy is hysterical.
The dog got another bite.</i>

996
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:41,539
<i>"Blood was everywhere.</i>

997
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:45,209
<i>"It was teeth marks
that looked something like this.</i>

998
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:49,811
<i>"One of our medics came,
and he taught me how to give stitches.</i>

999
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:53,615
<i>"It was kind of fun,
but I felt horrible for this guy.</i>

1000
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:59,334
<i>"The dogs should've never been there."</i>

1001
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:23,452
One of the things
an interrogator does every time,

1002
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:25,457
it's the last paragraph of all your reports,

1003
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:28,458
is you evaluate the truthfulness
and reliability of the information

1004
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:29,535
that was just given you.

1005
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:32,936
That's the very last paragraph
of every report you ever write.

1006
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:38,771
So if I get information through torture
I have no way to verify anything

1007
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:41,812
because, well, I would just assume
that you're going to tell me

1008
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:44,500
whatever the hell you want
so the pain stops.

1009
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:48,249
But if I give you some carrots
and I give you some reasons

1010
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:51,178
to cooperate with me,

1011
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:53,530
usually you're going to get 
more righteous information.

1012
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:59,256
General Sanchez routinely subjected 
Colonel Pappas

1013
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:03,168
to this finger pointing,
poking a finger in his chest

1014
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:09,489
and saying, "I want Saddam. Find Saddam!
Find Saddam! Do you understand me?

1015
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:13,977
"Find Saddam!
Find Saddam at whatever the cost."

1016
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:17,775
If you poke your finger
in somebody's chest long enough,

1017
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:22,371
they'll do whatever they need to do
to get you to stop doing that.

1018
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:24,730
It's a downward spiral.

1019
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:29,490
"This isn't working. Try this.
This worked in Gitmo.

1020
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:34,375
"This worked in Bagram. 
Try this. It's okay."

1021
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:40,940
It doesn't stop the mortars,
doesn't get the information they want,

1022
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:43,016
and it doesn't find Saddam.

1023
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:47,732
It wasn't any information they obtained
in any interrogation

1024
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:49,896
or interview out at Abu Ghraib.

1025
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:53,171
It was soldiers on the ground
who found Saddam.

1026
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:59,579
<i>You ready for this?
The farm that Saddam was hiding on,</i>

1027
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:02,214
<i>a little tiny farm
right next to the Tigris River.</i>

1028
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:04,479
<i>Saddam knocked on the door,</i>

1029
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:09,730
and he said, "I'm Saddam Hussein.
I'm the President of Iraq.

1030
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:13,250
"I am the leader of Iraq
and all the people of Iraq are my people.

1031
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:15,974
"All the homes in Iraq are my homes."

1032
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:19,570
And he went to the kitchen
and he made hisself a single egg

1033
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:25,649
<i>and he ate the egg and he left.</i>

1034
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:30,410
<i>And he came back about four hours later,
and he's like, "I'm staying here."</i>

1035
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:36,609
<i>And the dude's wife, like, freaked.</i>

1036
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:50,692
<i>Saddam was captured
on the 13th, Sunday morning.</i>

1037
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:56,299
<i>And then on Monday,
I had to report to Colonel Pappas' office.</i>

1038
01:22:56,420 --> 01:23:00,493
<i>He asked if we wanted to volunteer
for a special projects team.</i>

1039
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:04,374
<i>He'd just got off the phone
with Defence Secretary Rumsfeld.</i>

1040
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:07,219
<i>Rumsfeld and Sanchez had authorised
all approach techniques</i>

1041
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:09,376
<i>on the high value detainees.</i>

1042
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:12,935
They said we had the opportunity
to break the insurgency right then,

1043
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:15,415
'cause of the stuff
that was captured with Saddam.

1044
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:17,735
And at that time I believed it.

1045
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:38,451
<i>You have to look at exactly
what the pictures depict.</i>

1046
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:44,255
It was important to separate those
that were criminal acts

1047
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:46,940
and those things that were not criminal acts.

1048
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:50,052
And that's what the prosecution
would have to focus on.

1049
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:59,973
<i>If somebody was physically injured,
you know you have a criminal act.</i>

1050
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:10,176
<i>Putting somebody
into sexually humiliating positions,</i>

1051
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:12,131
<i>you have a criminal act.</i>

1052
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:18,209
<i>Making them abuse themselves sexually,
you have a criminal act.</i>

1053
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:24,573
<i>Standing by and watching somebody hit 
their head on the wall</i>

1054
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:27,168
<i>and taking photographs at the time,</i>

1055
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:31,532
<i>that's dereliction of duty,
so it's a criminal act.</i>

1056
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:42,336
<i>The individual with the wires
tied to their hands and standing on a box,</i>

1057
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:47,250
<i>I see that as somebody
that's being put into a stress position.</i>

1058
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:48,335
<i>I'm looking at it, thinking,</i>

1059
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:50,496
<i>"They don't look
like they're real electrical wires."</i>

1060
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:54,612
<i>Standard operating procedure.
That's all it is.</i>

1061
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:07,456
<i>Does this one actually constitute a crime
or is it standard operating procedure?</i>

1062
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:10,378
<i>That's probably
standard operating procedure.</i>

1063
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:22,970
<i>The panties on the head are an added touch,
but it's no more than sleep deprivation.</i>

1064
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:28,219
<i>They weren't being tortured, per se.</i>

1065
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:32,618
<i>They were going through discomfort
to try to aid in obtaining information.</i>

1066
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:43,049
<i>I've been in the Army for 20 years.
You know, I've been to Desert Storm One.</i>

1067
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:47,378
<i>I spent four months at Guantanamo Bay.</i>

1068
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,036
<i>People that haven't been 
where I've been,</i>

1069
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:53,050
I can't expect them to see the pictures
in the same way.

1070
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:24,048
I came back from a meeting,
it was very late at night.

1071
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:26,489
I opened my classified e-mail.

1072
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:31,057
"Ma'am, just wanted to let you know
I'm going in to brief

1073
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:36,857
"the CG on the progress
of the investigation at Abu Ghraib.

1074
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:41,929
"This involves the allegations of abuse
and the photographs."

1075
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:43,937
And I sent an e-mail back to him and I said,

1076
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:46,528
"I don't know what to say.
First I've heard of it."

1077
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:53,214
I was preparing in my mind
to hold a mini-press conference,

1078
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:57,533
to tell the truth and to tell it early.

1079
01:26:57,660 --> 01:27:00,333
To say, "This is what we've uncovered.

1080
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:05,773
"We're looking into it
because we discipline ourselves.

1081
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:09,893
"We're Americans,
and we know right from wrong."

1082
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:14,810
General Sanchez said, "No, absolutely not.
You're not to discuss this with anyone."

1083
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:19,177
The fear of the truth,

1084
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:23,813
silenced people.

1085
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:29,138
Everybody knew.
Everybody that was inside of that prison,

1086
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:33,219
that stayed there, lived there,
worked there, they had the pictures.

1087
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:36,571
They would come over
and they would get copies from Graner.

1088
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:39,294
And he had all these discs
so he would make copies.

1089
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:42,173
"Well, here you go, here you go,
which ones do you want?"

1090
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:46,976
Everybody had a copy of a picture.
Everybody knew.

1091
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:52,933
When those photographs came out,
the infamous photographs,

1092
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:59,135
the day after Colonel Pappas issued

1093
01:27:59,260 --> 01:28:02,138
a battalion-wide amnesty period.

1094
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:06,449
<i>Any type of evidence was destroyed.</i>

1095
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:10,540
<i>Burn it, throw it away,
erase it off your hard drive</i>

1096
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:12,332
<i>and be done with it.</i>

1097
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:17,493
He just wiped out
every last single defence witness,

1098
01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:19,451
every last single person

1099
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:22,014
that would've been available
to come forward

1100
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:26,611
and say, "Look, this is what I know,"
in one day.

1101
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:30,574
You know, after the amnesty period,
who's gonna want to come forward?

1102
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:33,214
Who's gonna want to say,
"Hey, I know something.

1103
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:36,218
"I know what happened"? No one.

1104
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:44,569
<i>Find a way to make it go away
and that's what they did.</i>

1105
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:52,657
<i>Sacrifice the little guys,
that's how they cover it up.</i>

1106
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:08,971
<i>I'm a 28-year-old young American.
A volunteer soldier.</i>

1107
01:29:10,060 --> 01:29:12,699
<i>And I'm gonna get
everything blamed on me.</i>

1108
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:23,418
<i>"Well, sweetie, you married a criminal.
Yep, the pictures are out</i>

1109
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:27,738
<i>"and I'm under investigation
as of 10 a.m. this morning.</i>

1110
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:31,773
<i>"So much for turning those pictures in
when I come home.</i>

1111
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:34,698
<i>"I knew I'd be in trouble 
just by being there.</i>

1112
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:40,009
<i>"But how else would you let people know
the shit the Army does?</i>

1113
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:49,138
<i>"You think I'd be scared, 
but I'm not.</i>

1114
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:52,570
<i>"I knew I'd go down with them.
Wrong place, wrong time.</i>

1115
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:59,531
<i>"What sucks is almost
the entire company knows what happened,</i>

1116
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:02,732
<i>"have seen the pictures
and have done nothing."</i>

1117
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:36,529
<i>My husband is in prison right now.</i>

1118
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:42,455
I can't move on from this
until he comes home.

1119
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:46,812
So, that's pretty difficult.

1120
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:07,938
This huge political monster
cost Lynndie England three years,

1121
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:11,211
Ivan Frederick eight years
and my husband ten years.

1122
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:19,019
When I went through Desert Storm,
we were seen as the rescuers, the heroes.

1123
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:23,930
Our mission was to reclaim Kuwait.
That was something that was honourable.

1124
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:27,097
This war in Iraq, like Vietnam,

1125
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:31,338
will probably get remembered
as the one time that we were not the heroes,

1126
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:33,690
we were not the saviours.

1127
01:31:33,820 --> 01:31:36,937
And these photographs
will play a big part in that.

1128
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:42,536
War is a stressful time for people.

1129
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:46,938
They were getting shelled
on a frequent basis at that prison.

1130
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:49,620
A young person with no experience in the world,

1131
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:53,858
being thrown into something like that,
may get confused.

1132
01:31:55,740 --> 01:31:58,208
We all say that hindsight is 20-20.

1133
01:31:58,340 --> 01:32:03,460
And I'm sure they all look back
realising what happened was wrong,

1134
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:08,449
and they played a part in something
that was very embarrassing for the country.

1135
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:11,140
But at the time, they were in a war zone

1136
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:15,378
where the rules get fuzzy sometimes.

1137
01:32:18,220 --> 01:32:21,178
Lynndie England,
I really feel sorry for that gal.

1138
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:25,054
It's obvious she is one 
of those young people

1139
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:27,330
that doesn't have much experience in life.

1140
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:28,495
There had been no indication

1141
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:31,134
that she would have been involved
in anything like this.

1142
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:33,490
But she was in love.

1143
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:37,090
Ambuhl. She...

1144
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:44,055
Well, she knew when the line was drawn
and when it was time for her to disappear.

1145
01:32:44,180 --> 01:32:46,136
Because she would be present
during some things

1146
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:48,899
and then noticeably absent during others.

1147
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:52,975
So she was probably
one of the smarter ones.

1148
01:32:56,900 --> 01:33:00,370
<i>In the pictures that came out in the media,
all you seen was me.</i>

1149
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:02,815
<i>You didn't see Megan</i>

1150
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:05,849
<i>'cause that was the cropped picture.</i>

1151
01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:11,571
<i>Graner told me he just wanted her 
out of the shot,</i>

1152
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:20,329
'cause it was interfering with,
I don't know, his picture.

1153
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:25,457
Maybe it was to secretly protect her,

1154
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:29,334
because now that I know
that they were closer

1155
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:33,772
than what I thought at the time,
maybe he was trying to protect her.

1156
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:39,258
When did he find out
that you were pregnant?

1157
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:42,099
Well, when I found out on February 20th,

1158
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:44,575
I come back and I told 
the First Sergeant Commander.

1159
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:47,817
And, of course,
they wanted to know who the father was.

1160
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:50,738
So they knew, and then I told him.

1161
01:33:50,860 --> 01:33:52,691
At first he sounded excited

1162
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:56,495
and then he was just like
he didn't want anything to do with me.

1163
01:33:56,620 --> 01:33:58,292
He didn't want anything to do with the baby.

1164
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:01,014
Once the story broke,

1165
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:05,338
and it came out that I was pregnant,
he denied that the baby was his.

1166
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:08,850
He was accusing me of cheating on him,
which I never did.

1167
01:34:12,140 --> 01:34:16,213
So if that's how he wants to play it,
then that's fine with me.

1168
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:17,978
He'll never see him.

1169
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:22,533
It's his choice.

1170
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:29,689
I was in the mess hall. 
I look up

1171
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:36,935
and I saw myself and Dan Rather
and I'm like, "What the hell?"

1172
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:40,018
It's like, "Javal, Sergeant Javal Davis."

1173
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:43,337
I'm like, "Whoa. Yo, that's me.

1174
01:34:43,460 --> 01:34:45,928
"Where the hell did they get 
this picture from?"

1175
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:47,413
They went to my high school.

1176
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:51,419
They acquired a picture of me
from the newspaper

1177
01:34:51,540 --> 01:34:54,532
when I was running track,
going over a hurdle.

1178
01:34:54,660 --> 01:34:57,458
They cut my face out
and showed me like this.

1179
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:01,492
But, in actuality,
I was jumping over a hurdle.

1180
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:05,571
So they made me look like
this mean-ass guy.

1181
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:10,774
They're showing naked people in a pyramid
and then they show a picture of me.

1182
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:13,050
I'm like, "Hold on.
If you look at these pictures,

1183
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:15,899
"do you see a black guy anywhere
in any of these pictures?"

1184
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:21,169
There would be no me, 
no no one else,

1185
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:24,610
no shock-the-world, no scandal,
if there wasn't any photographs.

1186
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:28,369
It'd went away, it'd went underneath a rock,
and that would have been the end of it.

1187
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:39,331
<i>Photographs are what they are.</i>

1188
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:42,020
<i>You can interpret them differently,</i>

1189
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:45,018
<i>but what the photograph depicts
is what it is.</i>

1190
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:51,938
<i>You can put any kind of meaning to it</i>

1191
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:55,450
<i>but you're seeing what happened 
at that snapshot in time.</i>

1192
01:36:01,900 --> 01:36:07,133
<i>You could read emotion on their face
and feelings in their eyes,</i>

1193
01:36:08,260 --> 01:36:11,218
<i>but it's nothing
that can be entered into fact.</i>

1194
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:17,812
All you can do is report
what's in the picture.

1195
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:23,609
Somebody caught our administration
with their pants down. That's it.

1196
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:24,968
They're pissed off at that.

1197
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:27,059
You can kill people off-camera.

1198
01:36:27,180 --> 01:36:29,819
You can shoot people.
You can, you know, blow their heads off.

1199
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:34,058
As long as it's not on camera, you're okay.
But if it's on camera, you're done.

1200
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:37,895
You know, torture didn't happen 
in those photographs.

1201
01:36:38,020 --> 01:36:41,649
That was humiliation.
That was softening up.

1202
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:43,771
Torture happened during interrogations.

1203
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:47,097
Guys going through interrogation,
and they're dead,

1204
01:36:47,220 --> 01:36:49,176
and they were killed, and they died.

1205
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:51,939
That's where the torture happened.
We don't have photographs of that.

1206
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:07,733
I just thought it was a bunch
of schmuck MPs acting like idiots.

1207
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:10,613
I don't think so any more, not at all.

1208
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:14,780
I think you got a bunch of kids
getting shammed.

1209
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:17,175
It's just cover-ups
and people are afraid of culpability

1210
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:21,293
and ramifications of their actions,
so there's nobody saying crap.

1211
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:25,816
Except they're throwing a lot of people
under the bus.

1212
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:30,291
I received a phone call

1213
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:38,056
from a Pentagon reporter who said,
"You were relieved from command."

1214
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:43,409
So I said, "I haven't heard about it."

1215
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:46,771
I didn't hear from General Helmly.
He didn't call me.

1216
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:50,973
He didn't summon me to Washington D.C.
To be in front of his desk

1217
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:52,897
so he could relieve me.

1218
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:57,294
This is cowardice of a different kind.

1219
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:02,409
You're afraid to look 
Janis Karpinski in the eye?

1220
01:38:04,340 --> 01:38:08,413
I got a letter 10 days later from his office,

1221
01:38:09,740 --> 01:38:12,937
relieving me from command
of the 800th brigade.

1222
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:21,291
My name was a good name in the military
until I did what I did.

1223
01:38:23,380 --> 01:38:28,898
My uncle died in Vietnam 13 years 
to the day till I was born.

1224
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:36,015
My dad has two bronze stars
for valour from Vietnam.

1225
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:39,052
My grandfather's got a bronze star from Vietnam.

1226
01:38:42,020 --> 01:38:44,978
And then I come along
and get involved in that.

1227
01:38:48,980 --> 01:38:52,177
That just put that name in the mud.

1228
01:38:56,940 --> 01:39:01,934
You're taught from the very beginning
that you have to follow your orders.

1229
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:04,972
And if you don't, 
you're gonna get in trouble.

1230
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:08,456
And if you do,
obviously you end up in trouble.

1231
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:12,812
You know, it's easy for retired colonels
and generals, and majors,

1232
01:39:12,940 --> 01:39:14,089
or whatever to stand there and say,

1233
01:39:14,220 --> 01:39:15,938
"Well, these people
should have known illegal orders

1234
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:19,257
"and they should've stood up
to these lieutenant-colonels and majors.

1235
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:21,894
"And they should-a stood up to them
at the time in a war zone,

1236
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:24,011
"where, you know, lives were at stake."

1237
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:27,689
And it's just kind of unrealistic
to think that...

1238
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:31,778
that that would happen.

1239
01:39:33,820 --> 01:39:37,893
You were getting shelled every day,
shot at every day.

1240
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:41,854
Detainees, you know,
putting together shanks,

1241
01:39:41,980 --> 01:39:43,891
weapons, starting riots.

1242
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:47,978
You know, this guy blew up, like, 
10 of my buddies.

1243
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:49,897
He needs to get his behind kicked.

1244
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:54,172
I know what I can do and I know what I...
and I think I know what I can't do.

1245
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:57,610
I think I know what I can't do,
but I see these guys doing this

1246
01:39:57,740 --> 01:40:00,459
and I see, you know, 
the CIA guys coming and doing this.

1247
01:40:00,580 --> 01:40:02,810
You know, after a while it's like,
"You know what?

1248
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:04,817
"It's free reign, just don't kill them."

1249
01:40:05,540 --> 01:40:09,738
I was not the same person there
that I am sitting in this chair,

1250
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:12,499
or that I was before I got there.

1251
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:17,538
I don't know what I could've done different.

1252
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:21,216
I could've said,
"Screw you, I'm not working here"

1253
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:24,810
and just gone to jail
for disobeying an order, I guess.

1254
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:27,500
But, I don't know.

1255
01:40:30,740 --> 01:40:33,300
I'm sure everybody can do
something different put in...

1256
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:35,490
I just don't know
what I would've done different,

1257
01:40:35,620 --> 01:40:37,531
put in the same situation.

1258
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:42,410
If I could back all the way up,
I wouldn't have joined the military.

1259
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:45,134
That's what I would have done different.

1260
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:48,451
It's just not worth it.

1261
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:54,377
You go through all that trouble to start back 
where you were when you first went in.

1262
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:57,139
Trying to get in school, 
trying to get...

1263
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:01,897
It just wasn't worth it.

1264
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:07,335
I just want to go on with life.

1265
01:41:08,940 --> 01:41:12,012
You know, get a job, 
raise my son.

1266
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:17,454
I don't think I have a lot of choices.

1267
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:22,336
Can't change anything, so...

1268
01:41:25,020 --> 01:41:27,693
And if I did, 
then I wouldn't have Carter.

1269
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:32,737
I mean, I wouldn't trade him
for the world, so...

1270
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:36,532
I wouldn't want to go back
and change anything.

1271
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:42,289
It's how the world turns, ain't it?

1272
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:46,415
People backstabbing other people.

1273
01:41:47,420 --> 01:41:53,768
Unfairness. It's drama. It's life.
You live it. Now I just got to move on.

1274
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:05,457
I don't know. 
I swear to God, I don't know.

1275
01:42:05,580 --> 01:42:08,140
I'm so fricking confused
about the shit that happened there.

1276
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:11,809
I go over it in my head every day,
and I dream about it every fricking night.

1277
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:19,379
Dream about all kinds of things.
Most of them aren't good.

1278
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:21,456
You know, before I thought
about breaking the fricking back

1279
01:42:21,580 --> 01:42:23,696
of the insurgency and how stupid we were,

1280
01:42:23,820 --> 01:42:26,653
and how we could've fixed this shit,
and how we could've saved fricking lives.

1281
01:42:26,780 --> 01:42:30,534
But, really, there's not a snowball's chance
in hell you could fix any of that.

1282
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:35,129
If we leave, they're killing each other
and they're not killing us.

1283
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:37,649
If we stay, they're killing each other
and they're killing us.

1284
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:42,457
<i>That's the end result
of this whole fucking debacle.</i>

1285
01:43:20,380 --> 01:43:23,929
<i>To the east side of Abu Ghraib
was a huge date palm forest.</i>

1286
01:43:25,980 --> 01:43:28,175
<i>Within five, ten minutes after sun up,</i>

1287
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:31,531
millions of fricking birds took off
out of the date palms

1288
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:35,050
and just blacked out the sunrise 
to the east where I'm looking.

1289
01:43:35,180 --> 01:43:38,650
And they'd fly northwest
and go over the top corner of the post.

1290
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:41,578
And I'd try to get out of my booth

1291
01:43:41,700 --> 01:43:43,975
or take a break, a cigarette break,
around sunset,

1292
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:48,616
because those birds came back every night
about 30 minutes, 15 minutes before sunset,

1293
01:43:48,740 --> 01:43:52,653
and landed back in the date palms.
So I started my day, every day,

1294
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:55,055
at least watching those guys,
the birdies take off

1295
01:43:55,180 --> 01:43:58,217
and at least thinking
something in the world was still normal.

1296
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:05,095
<i>They could fly away from Abu G.</i>

1297
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:09,939
<i>They came back every night,
but they could fly away every morning.</i>

1298
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:14,809
<i>It helped deal with the weirdness.</i>
