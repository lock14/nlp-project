00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:19,930
- Okay, ante up.
- Five.

3
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,310
Okay, l see your five.

4
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,820
- Back in the slammer.
- Those were my last smokes.

5
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,360
This game sucks.

6
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:47,040
This whole place sucks.

7
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,480
Lieutenant, l think you'd
better have a look at this.

8
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:35,250
What the hell is he doing here?

9
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:40,470
Tell the captain we've got
a situation. A NEB coming in.

10
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,430
- How did he get this far?
- l'm going to take him.

11
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,270
He's mine.

12
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:17,170
- What are you waiting for?
- Something's not right. He's alone.

13
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,640
Here comes the cavalry.

14
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,130
No matter how many times
l see this, it still makes me sick.

15
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,310
l'm glad
those things are on our side.

16
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:06,240
Our side's the good side, right?
Tell me again, it's a little blurry.

17
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,950
We created them.
We didn't have any choice.

18
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,700
Without the screamers
we'd have lost the war.

19
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:21,670
- ls the NEB still out there?
- Yeah, but not in one piece.

20
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,670
Just the one?
What the hell was he doing out here?

21
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,800
He had something in his hand
that he wanted to show us.

22
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,940
Well...
l guess l'd better take a look.

23
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,360
Are you going out there?

24
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,820
That's a great plan.
lt's probably some kind of bomb.

25
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,330
Get off your butt
and open the goddamn door.

26
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,470
Check your tabs, sir.

27
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,510
CRUClAL: TO ALLlANCE COM MANDER

28
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,170
- Who wrote this shit?
- Mozart.

29
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,380
- "Don Giovanni."
- Don Giovanni?

30
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,630
What the hell do you want, Chuck?

31
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,560
Tear your eye away from that coin,
and l'll tell you.

32
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,770
lt's the portrait of a sphinx.

33
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:10,900
lt belonged to Augustus Caesar, the
first great emperor of the world.

34
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,990
Riddle me this, Caesar. We haven't
seen a NEB soldier in six months.

35
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:20,910
Why does one solitary grunt
get shredded by a screamer -

36
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,240
- trying to hand deliver this?

37
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:33,590
Priority seven. You and me... and
God, if he's still paying attention.

38
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,840
l doubt it.

39
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,430
- ls it a trick?
- l couldn't get into it, either.

40
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,310
- Don't do that!
- Scared you, didn't l?

41
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:55,190
Jesus!

42
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:06,160
"From Marshall Richard Cooper,
Fifth NEB Army Command."

43
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:11,080
"To Joseph Hendricksson.
Matters of extreme urgency."

44
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,630
"Demand immediate
peace negotiation."

45
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,470
"Request two officers.
Safe passage guaranteed."

46
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:24,850
"We await your arrival ASAP."

47
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:29,100
- Peace negotiation.
- They sound pretty desperate.

48
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:35,730
- We've been waiting for this.
- What have we been waiting for?

49
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,190
The end of the war.

50
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,030
Maybe it's another bullshit tactic
to get us to lay back.

51
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,490
- MacDonald, are you there?
- Yes, sir.

52
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,630
l want the following message
transmitted to San Francisco.

53
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,340
Have received first contact
from NEB army in six months.

54
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:06,560
They wish to open peace
negotiations. Please advise.

55
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,690
We picked up an emergency message
from a commercial transport.

56
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,810
We're 5 million miles
off of the shipping lanes.

57
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:21,820
Find out what their emergency is.
No clearance, no landing.

58
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,740
Joe, what do you make of this?

59
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,830
Looks like a map
of the forward command post.

60
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,840
- They're laying themselves open.
- So why the pony express?

61
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,550
They've been completely silent
for two weeks. Not even radio.

62
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,390
But why just one guy?
Why not a patrol?

63
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:05,910
- Secretary Green is arriving.
- Thank you, MacDonald.

64
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,630
Joe, Chuck, l have some very
inspiring news for you all.

65
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,760
Alliance HQ has been keeping
it classified. Wrapped up tight.

66
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:32,600
The NEB Corporation has approached
us requesting an armistice.

67
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:37,560
We could actually end this war.

68
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:41,530
Reserves of berynium
have been found on Triton 4.

69
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:48,990
After extensive testing,
there's no sign of radioactivity.

70
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,620
We are on the verge of signing
a world peace agreement.

71
00:15:53,790 --> 00:16:00,130
We'd also renew contracts
with the NEB to mine on Triton 4.

72
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:04,920
These negotiations
are extremely delicate -

73
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:10,470
- and we can't afford to do anything
that might upset the apple cart...

74
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,180
- Sorry, sir.
- Fix it.

75
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:22,070
- There's radiation interference.
- Give me the damn thing.

76
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:27,990
Morse code was better
than this virtual reality shit.

77
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:35,330
lt is imperative to make no contact
with NEB Command on Sirius 6B.

78
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:42,130
l'm sure you won't do anything that
would jeopardise our chances now.

79
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:51,510
Peace, can you believe it?
The NEBs are businessmen.

80
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,600
Now they're mining on Triton 4,
peace is in their interest.

81
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:59,230
- Thank God for Green.
- He's a good man.

82
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,810
He prevented a war on Earth.

83
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,990
A war on Earth
might've done them some good.

84
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:10,740
lf those assholes
rolled around in the mud.

85
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,280
- Which assholes?
- NEBs and us.

86
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,210
- We were all NEBs once.
- Exactly.

87
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:30,050
l just want to go home.

88
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,550
What's the first thing you'll do?

89
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,890
l've got no plans for the future.

90
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,730
- You have a lot to look forward to.
- lncome tax.

91
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:50,360
Are you going to look her up
when you get back?

92
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:55,830
- What for?
- You tell me.

93
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,540
She couldn't take it.
She's married and moved on...

94
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,580
...and l'm still here.

95
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,380
Not for long.
Do you still think about her?

96
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:13,590
lt used to be every minute,
then once a day.

97
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,060
About twice a year
l get a kick in the chest.

98
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,930
What did she look like?

99
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,520
All personnel. Radiation alert!
Please light your reds.

100
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:29,440
l left mine in the office.
Have you got one?

101
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:36,490
He must have been a brave man...
that NEB soldier.

102
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:49,710
Alert!
All personnel to their stations.

103
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,960
- They're not civilians.
- No, a troop transport. All ours.

104
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,290
- How bad is it?
- No survivors.

105
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,510
- Then what the hell is that?
- Get me out of here, man!

106
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:39,010
We're going to cut you out of here.
Just hang on.

107
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:45,730
"Sirius 6B Transportation."
We've got no transportation service!

108
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:51,320
- What the hell is that?
- You've got to look at this.

109
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,660
- Look at this.
- And this. lt's a bomb factory.

110
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,540
Holy shit!

111
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,620
A nuclear reactor!

112
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:10,040
- When did we last see one of these?
- What's happening here?

113
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,550
Come on.

114
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:20,430
- Careful. Are you all right?
- Calm down. l'm all right.

115
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,720
- Get this man a tab.
- What the hell's a tab?

116
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,400
- This guy's naked here.
- Hold on a second.

117
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,230
One second!

118
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,930
l'm out of here.

119
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:02,490
You wanted to see me, Commander?

120
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,740
Yeah.
At ease, we're informal around here.

121
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:10,080
That'll be all, Rodgers.

122
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:18,170
- How are you doing?
- Good... there's a scar on my arm.

123
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:23,470
lf you go outside without a tab on,
you'll lose your arm. Name?

124
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,060
Private Michael Jefferson.
Gunnery specialist on six levels.

125
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,270
First class.

126
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,730
Level six? You can shoot
the dots off a dice at 1 00 yards.

127
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:42,320
lf you can load it, l can shoot it.
lnstructors used to call me "Ace".

128
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,620
- Everybody here calls me "sir".
- Yes, sir.

129
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:57,710
- Sir, what are they?
- lt's a sword. Take a look.

130
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:03,840
Screamers were developed to
neutralize the war on the ground.

131
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:10,180
- How do you know it's dead?
- l yanked its brain out.

132
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:17,020
- That'll take your finger off!
- You said it was dead.

133
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:20,690
lt still has
a mechanical surface reflex.

134
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:25,280
They get shot up, but can still
swing a sword. Pretty smart.

135
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:30,910
Maybe too smart.
lt seems to have modified itself.

136
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,210
Where's everybody else?
The guys who were with me?

137
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:40,250
- How many men onboard?
- 38, including me.

138
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,760
Now there's one, including you.

139
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,430
Those guys...

140
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:57,350
l didn't even know them.
l couldn't even talk to them.

141
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,110
Jefferson... what in the hell
are you doing here?

142
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:08,950
There was a nuclear reactor aboard
programmed for weapons manufacture.

143
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,790
- l wasn't aware of that.
- You radioed you were civilian.

144
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:21,460
- Where were you bound?
- Triton 4.

145
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:25,920
Why were you carrying
a nuclear reactor and weapons?

146
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,140
To invade, attack
and extinguish the enemy.

147
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,100
- What enemy?
- The NEBs.

148
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:38,150
You were going to attack
the NEBs on Triton 4?

149
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:43,320
Yes... but we're just a task force.

150
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:50,160
4,000 Alliance Army regulars are
on their way to Triton 4 right now.

151
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,160
- Secretary Green informed us...
- Secretary Green?

152
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:58,830
- That's right.
- Secretary Green is gone.

153
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,840
He's been gone
for almost two years.

154
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:10,180
We got a V. R. communique
from him yesterday.

155
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:16,640
Secretary Green was arrested and
eliminated by the Alliance command.

156
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:22,020
Two years ago.

157
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,530
Dismissed.

158
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:39,960
- l enlisted to fight...
- Dismissed, Jefferson.

159
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:45,630
- The NEBs have been running...
- Get out of here!

160
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:02,190
What in God's name
are we doing, Chuck?

161
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:09,400
- We just saw Green.
- We saw bullshit!

162
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:15,740
You know as well as l do that
they can send us anything they want.

163
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:22,620
- That kid doesn't know policy.
- Get your head out of the lilacs.

164
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:27,340
Do you expect me to believe
that we're being dumped?

165
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,590
That our 20-year stand here has
turned into a galactic gold rush?

166
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,800
They keep sending us provisions.

167
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:41,890
Will they let us die up here while
they carry on running the universe?

168
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,610
- l don't buy it.
- Wake up, man!

169
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:50,490
We are betrayed here, brother.
We are beached.

170
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:57,120
Green's been shit-canned
and this whole place is a lie!

171
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,870
They just can't
cut us off up here.

172
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,790
Families on Earth would raise hell.

173
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,250
And they won't take us back there.

174
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:13,470
lf we sound off about this, nobody's
going to fight their war for them.

175
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:18,510
They're just going to let us
roll on and on up here.

176
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,980
We ain't ever getting off here.

177
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:27,480
Marshall Cooper and
his NEB Command knows it, too!

178
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:30,110
He sent us a map.

179
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:36,740
Your solitary NEB grunt
got his ass shot to stop this thing.

180
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:39,870
They know it's pointless now.

181
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:46,330
- Where are you going?
- l'm going to NEB Command.

182
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,500
We'll make our own peace right here.

183
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:58,760
NEB said they wanted two men.

184
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:07,980
Somebody's got to stay here in case
anyone else falls out of the sky.

185
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:11,270
- l'll take Johnny Gung-Ho.
- The kid?

186
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,030
l'm not risking any more of our men.

187
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:24,620
This is your tab.
lt won't work for anybody but you.

188
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:27,830
That makes me feel a lot better.

189
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,840
Screamers only attack living things.
They read your pulse rate.

190
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,380
Your tab broadcasts
a false heartbeat, flat-lining you.

191
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:41,470
ln theory they work perfectly,
but radioactivity corrodes them.

192
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,390
- What then?
- We thank God you're a good gunner.

193
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:03,080
l was remembering that day
up in Point Reyes.

194
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,790
- That bartender...
- With the monkey.

195
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:14,380
The beach. We sat drinking beer,
watching the humpbacks blowing.

196
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:20,640
You watched the whales, Joe.
l was watching other things.

197
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,180
We should go back there.
l'd like to see that again.

198
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:30,230
What, girls volleyball?

199
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:38,780
Hey, Joe...

200
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,870
l'll see you soon.

201
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:46,910
On that day. Jefferson, are you
coming or are you breathing hard?

202
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,920
Good luck.

203
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:53,940
Cicero, this is Libby.
Radio check, over.

204
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,360
Cicero reading you loud and clear.

205
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:03,410
Next transmission will be 33:00
and then every 4 hours after that.

206
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:08,030
lf l miss one, don't sweat it.
lf l miss two...

207
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,460
...move into the office,
change the music and carry on.

208
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:17,880
l'll take the office, but the
"Don Giovanni" will have to go.

209
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,710
Roger, copy.

210
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:56,330
- The air is terrible out here.
- lt's what's in the air.

211
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:03,050
- What, radiation?
- This'll neutralize it. Here.

212
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:08,600
- lt's an anti-radiation red.
- That's what poisoned it?

213
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:15,600
That used to be the most profitable,
wonderful enterprise in the galaxy.

214
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:20,150
lt produced berynium. The answer
to the world's energy question.

215
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,320
A spoonful could take you from
Earth to Saturn in a day.

216
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:28,410
Then those mines started
puking up tons of radiation.

217
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:33,370
We thought we'd discovered gold...
but we discovered shit.

218
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:40,290
And you smoke this shit just to
neutralize the shit in your lungs.

219
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:48,390
- How do you know it's working?
- lf you don't die.

220
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:57,940
- God! What happened here?
- Blasts.

221
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,150
- NEB bombers.
- They nuked the civilians?

222
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:05,320
The civilians got in the way.
The bombs were aimed at us.

223
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:11,990
You just don't have a clue about
what brought you here, do you?

224
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:17,160
You'd fight for any son of a bitch
if he convinced you you were right.

225
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:21,960
- Someone convinced you.
- Not someone, something.

226
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:26,840
The Alliance was formed
to support you.

227
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:34,390
You're right, Jefferson. And it
divided my country and my world.

228
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:40,060
So as much as you're dying
to get shot by some NEB soldier, -

229
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:44,650
- we're going to make peace
with these people, you and me.

230
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:50,110
We're going to rip you off
of that experience.

231
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,370
Look at this place.

232
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:03,670
l came here 20 years ago
to mine berynium for the NEB.

233
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,840
We were all NEBs then.

234
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:12,510
The scientists found radiation
and shut down the mines.

235
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:18,680
The NEB Corporation threatened them,
and there was a stand-off for years.

236
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:22,850
They they started to rain everything
down on us.

237
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,730
Nuclear disc bombs, chain bombs,
bacteria crystals.

238
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:33,700
Civilian survivors were evacuated.
We retreated to the bunker.

239
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:39,080
- How did you fight back?
- We reinvented an early weapon.

240
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:43,130
- The sword?
- The autonomous mobile sword.

241
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,750
The screamer.

242
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,640
Save it.

243
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:59,930
They don't eat rats, do they?

244
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,770
We're not sure.
They're scavengers and they learn.

245
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:10,440
They use everything. Rotting meat
gives off methane gas for fuel.

246
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,610
Maybe eyeball jelly
makes good blade wax.

247
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:18,540
Are they machines? Are they alive?
l don't understand...

248
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,120
l don't have the answers, Jefferson.

249
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:26,330
- But where are they coming from?
- Underground.

250
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:30,420
The first design was sent to us
from the Alliance on Earth.

251
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:33,720
lt's all automated now.

252
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:39,220
No one's been down there since they
pushed the first button and ran.

253
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:45,480
- They make themselves now.
- And no one knows how?

254
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:50,150
They're down there breeding
like rabbits and no one knows?

255
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,530
Am l speaking Swahili?
That's exactly what l mean.

256
00:35:56,870 --> 00:36:00,040
Hit the dirt!

257
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:11,340
Come out of there!

258
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:16,510
Come out of there!

259
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,220
Come forward.

260
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,270
- Stop.
- Can l come with you?

261
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,690
My God...

262
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:35,200
- Cover me.
- Go.

263
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:44,700
Jefferson.

264
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:08,150
You all right? lt's okay.

265
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,910
What have you got there?

266
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:24,740
Let me see.

267
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:30,920
That's a good guy.
No, you keep him.

268
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:36,090
That's your friend.
Where do you live?

269
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:40,340
- ln there?
- Yes.

270
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,560
ln the ruins?

271
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:51,190
How many are you?
How many people?

272
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:55,780
- You're alone? How do you survive?
- Food.

273
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:00,280
- What kind of food?
- Different.

274
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:05,160
How do you keep away
from the screamers?

275
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:09,410
- The blades underground that kill.
- l hide.

276
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:14,420
- Can l come with you?
- No, you stay here.

277
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:20,380
Give me a macro-ration.
We'll give you something to eat.

278
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:26,390
We'll come back for you.
ln two or three days we'll find you.

279
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:34,150
Take this.
You tear this and eat it.

280
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:41,240
- l want to come with you now.
- We'll come back in two days.

281
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,450
You take care of this guy, okay?

282
00:38:55,460 --> 00:39:00,920
We can't just leave him here.
He's a kid. He'll never survive.

283
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:05,470
- What am l saying?
- Can l come with you?

284
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:30,080
- What's your name?
- David Edward Dearing.

285
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:50,430
- Where's your mum and dad?
- They died in the blasts.

286
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,270
You've been alone here
for four years?

287
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:59,230
Everything seems to be okay.
ls it safe to make a fire like this?

288
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,030
We want to let them know
we're coming.

289
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,580
- Fire keeps the rats away.
- Rats?

290
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:14,000
l had this friend,
he used to eat them. Rats.

291
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,920
You'll appreciate this...

292
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:22,800
You don't just heat up the oil,
that makes them stick to the pan.

293
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,930
You get the pan hot, put the oil
in cold, then add your rats.

294
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,770
But don't crowd the pan,
it sucks all the heat out.

295
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,690
You keep flipping them,
or they burn.

296
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,110
- My friend said...
- Jefferson!

297
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:44,820
You must be confusing me
with somebody who gives a shit.

298
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:51,450
Give me that rock, boy.
Cicero, this is Libby calling.

299
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:56,210
- Come in, Cicero.
- Libby, how is it out there?

300
00:40:56,370 --> 00:41:01,210
lt's cold.
We're at 1 4 degrees north latitude.

301
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:05,510
We expect to reach
the NEB Command...

302
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:08,680
...in about four hours. Hello..?

303
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:13,810
We've got a new arrival.
He came in yesterday.

304
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:16,730
Chuck, you're breaking up.

305
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:21,310
You'll get your next transmission
at 00:00 hours.

306
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,070
- Libby, over.
- lt seems a little strange...

307
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:43,750
lf you're gonna be a rock,
be a rock. Don't be a bug.

308
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,680
Don't do that to me!
l nearly pissed my pants... sir.

309
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,180
Things ain't what they used to be.

310
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:13,140
Jefferson!

311
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,820
- Didn't you hear it?
- No.

312
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,960
- Good God, man!
- Cool, huh?

313
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:52,470
- Do you know how much they cost?
- Keep that on your wrist.

314
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,640
- Doesn't it work if it's nearby?
- lt stays on your arm!

315
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,180
l'm already dragging one kid around.
Do l have to tie your shoes for you?

316
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:05,850
Your tab was on
and it was going for you.

317
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,030
What is this?
l've never seen this.

318
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,410
lt looks like an animal.

319
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:24,660
lt's not an animal.
lt's an upgrade.

320
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:30,380
- Maybe it's a NEB one.
- Jefferson, relent.

321
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:34,670
We're getting out of here.
Take your bear with you.

322
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:39,600
- Where are we going?
- A long way for you, kid.

323
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:46,270
You soap the socks the night before.

324
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,360
The water dries out
but the soap stays in.

325
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:55,570
- You've got soap against skin...
- Have you got a dimmer switch?

326
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:59,950
lf you put a teddy bear
in a microwave, nothing will happen.

327
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:04,290
- But a wet frog...
- Shut up.

328
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:49,600
Jefferson!

329
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:57,320
Goddamn screamer!
lt wanted to kill us.

330
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:04,830
lt can see us and touch us.
l can't tell what the signals say.

331
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:07,370
lt can talk.

332
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:30,350
- He's a fucking toaster.
- That's right.

333
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:34,100
Pinocchio's not a real little boy.

334
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:39,280
- Why didn't it try to kill us?
- lt was tagging you.

335
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,950
They're smarter now. They get
into our bunkers. They tag along.

336
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,790
Who can resist a kid
with a hard luck story?

337
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:54,580
Once it gets inside, the killing
starts. But you knew that already.

338
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:59,000
- You brought him in here.
- lt found us.

339
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:02,470
What is your reason for being here?

340
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:06,890
We were invited here
for a peace negotiation.

341
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:13,060
Marshall Cooper sent this
from NEB headquarters.

342
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:21,110
You want to negotiate..?

343
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,400
We ain't gonna do it here.

344
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:34,660
- Are you taking them to the bunker?
- You got something better to do?

345
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,760
- Sir, do you trust these guys?
- No.

346
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:20,900
- What are you doing?
- Calling the office. Problem?

347
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,400
Cicero, this is Libby. Come in.

348
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:34,410
- How is it out there?
- We've got a new kind of screamer.

349
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:38,870
- l can't hear you real well.
- lt's a kid. A little boy.

350
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:44,880
- Don't let it into the bunker.
- l can't hear you.

351
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:48,130
There's too much interference.

352
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:11,740
That kid, he was like a person.

353
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:15,080
How did he know what to say?

354
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:19,580
You think Santa
makes them his little elves?

355
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:22,750
They've got more brains than you.

356
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:26,040
Fighting won't solve our problems.

357
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:33,050
One of those kids tagged my patrol.
We took him into our bunker.

358
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:37,600
- Nobody got out.
- Except you.

359
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:42,390
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You figure it out.

360
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,400
You guys brought them here.

361
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,610
Only after the bombing started.

362
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:54,450
But now they don't care what uniform
is covering your ass.

363
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:59,450
- Neither do l.
- Slow down, soldier.

364
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:03,250
Would you mind
taking that outside?

365
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,710
Stray bullets
are bad for the inventory.

366
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:12,800
lt's worth a lot more
when it ain't all shot to... shit.

367
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:18,100
l'm letting you stay here out of
the kindness of my heart, Becker.

368
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:25,690
So follow the ground rules.
First, no gunplay inside.

369
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:32,070
Second, this is my place,
and nobody touches anything.

370
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,820
Real Scotch, not synthetic shit.

371
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:41,500
No spitting.

372
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:47,080
Spare a cigarette?

373
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:59,510
Well, gentlemen...

374
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,680
Live it up.

375
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:27,710
l haven't had an American cigarette
in over a year.

376
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:31,670
There's plenty back at base,
but l forgot to bring them.

377
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:36,380
- You got the last one.
- Very generous of you.

378
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,680
What is this place, a commissary?

379
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:51,400
There hasn't been a commissary here
in over two years.

380
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:54,940
Not since those blades arrived.

381
00:53:55,110 --> 00:54:01,070
- Are you a freelancer?
- Right. Black market, Commander...

382
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,660
Hendricksson, Joseph. San Francisco.

383
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:07,790
Jessica Hanson, Pittsburgh.
How do you do?

384
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,000
- lt's early in the day for that.
- Yeah.

385
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,550
l'm looking for Marshall Cooper,
Fifth NEB Army.

386
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:19,970
He'd be in the command bunker,
if there still is one.

387
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:24,890
What about
your communication satellites?

388
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:29,060
lf they're still working,
they'd be in there, too.

389
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:31,980
What do you mean by that?

390
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:35,900
You have no idea
of the hell you opened up.

391
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:43,660
We opened up? Just tell me
where the command bunker is.

392
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:49,500
You wouldn't last ten yards
out there without me.

393
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:54,670
- Have you seen it?
- l heard it.

394
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:58,340
- Hordes of them.
- What hordes?

395
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:03,350
Davids. l heard them
screaming into the bunker above us.

396
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:06,770
l heard the soldiers screaming.

397
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:09,480
Then it got very quiet.

398
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:18,150
Nothing...
except the smell of death.

399
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:28,410
- Still want a guided tour?
- lf Cooper is alive, l'll find him.

400
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:34,710
l'll take you to Command.
We'll go underground.

401
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:42,510
- l want something in return.
- Speak.

402
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,470
- l want off this ashtray.
- Where?

403
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:52,850
Earth. How long do you think
l'm gonna last in here?

404
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:58,980
Nobody leaves. The NEBs and
Alliance are fighting on Triton 4.

405
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:04,610
They've hung everybody
on this planet out to dry.

406
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:11,410
Good Lord, you're beautiful.

407
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:19,960
l can take you back
to the Alliance bunker.

408
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:24,090
- Deal.
- Going somewhere, Jessica?

409
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:29,220
She's taking me to NEB Command
and l'm taking her to Alliance.

410
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:33,020
Cosy.

411
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:37,860
And then what?
Become a prisoner of war?

412
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:42,990
You can relocate anywhere
if you can get off this globe.

413
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:47,450
Or you can go straight to hell
for all l care.

414
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:52,250
You're crazy.
You don't know what's down there.

415
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:57,000
- Afraid of the dark, Ross?
- Get off my back.

416
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:09,550
Look at this. lt's one of ours.

417
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:14,350
She's got everything.
And l found something else.

418
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:27,610
- What is it?
- A plutonium rocket.

419
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:32,700
Plutonium? Have l been
blowing smoke out of my ass?

420
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:39,000
We've not used nukes in this war yet
and we're not going to use them now.

421
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:42,300
So leave it.

422
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:07,360
Okay, let's get on the good foot.
Anybody that's coming, come on.

423
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:11,320
"When he's best,
he's little worse than a man."

424
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:16,200
"And when he's worst,
he's little better than a beast."

425
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:20,420
l never knew they put
Shakespeare in comic books.

426
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:25,210
Ain't it sharp enough yet?

427
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:32,510
lt's never sharp enough.

428
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:49,530
l'm not sure if these tabs work,
but stay close to me and Jefferson.

429
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:53,160
Let's go.

430
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:26,730
This leads to the maintenance tunnel
underneath the command bunker.

431
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,240
l ain't going in there.

432
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:40,060
Don't tell me a big guy like you
is scared of mice!

433
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:45,190
- Has a rat got your tongue?
- Get off my back.

434
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:50,480
ls that all you know how to say?
Explain your vocabulary, Ross.

435
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:56,450
Knock it off!
Just get off my back!

436
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:32,440
We're almost there.

437
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:04,220
This is the command centre.
This is the ground level.

438
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:18,130
- What the hell is this?
- lt's exactly what you think it is.

439
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:23,930
l knew it!

440
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:27,350
We're all gonna die!

441
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:37,400
Jefferson, if that man moves,
or even farts, shoot him.

442
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:43,870
Shut up.

443
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:13,690
lf Richard Cooper were alive,
he'd be here, wouldn't he?

444
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:26,070
The ComSat stabilizers
are all frozen.

445
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:30,910
This one's free.

446
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:47,800
Uplink attempt initiated.
Sat Net downlink does not respond.

447
01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:59,780
Malfunction.
Sat Net does not respond.

448
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:01,350
Way to go, Ross.

449
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:11,360
Can l come with you?

450
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:25,550
Jefferson, get everybody
out of here now. Do it!

451
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:28,510
Go.

452
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:44,120
Can l come with you?

453
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:22,160
Can l come with you?

454
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:39,010
We're not leaving
without Hendricksson.

455
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:16,050
Can l come with you?

456
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:22,970
- Can l come with you?
- Jefferson!

457
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:26,390
Cute, Jefferson.

458
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:52,090
lt won't take them long
to get through this door.

459
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:48,930
- Thanks for waiting, Becker.
- Yeah, next time.

460
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:52,350
There won't be a next time.
That was stupid.

461
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:58,440
- What was so important back there?
- What other type?

462
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:03,820
David was a type 3.
The reptile was a type 1 .

463
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:08,200
What's the other type?

464
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:18,920
Can l come with you?

465
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:24,850
lt's a... type 2.

466
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:29,890
- Genius. You can count up to three.
- Get off my back!

467
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:35,270
- lt's a wounded soldier.
- "Help me. Help me."

468
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:40,610
There were only a few reported.
We thought you'd discontinued them.

469
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:44,910
- We've never seen them.
- What do they look like?

470
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:49,370
- Who do they look like?
- Look in the mirror, Ross.

471
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:55,750
l'm warning you...
just get off my back.

472
01:12:57,210 --> 01:13:02,720
They keep saying the same thing
over and over.

473
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,590
Just get off my..!

474
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:11,520
Exactly.

475
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:33,080
He's one of them.
He's a machine. Type 2.

476
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:37,540
He kept repeating himself.
You heard him.

477
01:13:37,710 --> 01:13:41,460
And what about the scotch?
You saw, he didn't take a sip.

478
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:47,430
That's right, sir.
We offered, but he refused.

479
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,310
That's blood.

480
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:09,030
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit? Take a look.

481
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:15,660
l see a human being who got
wasted for no reason at all.

482
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:30,430
- What are you looking at?
- That wasn't very human of you.

483
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:38,310
Until two days ago,
l didn't even know you existed.

484
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:42,320
You think l'm one of them?

485
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:47,110
Then you'd better kill me, too.

486
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:54,080
See if l've got any switches inside.
Come on, be on the safe side.

487
01:14:58,670 --> 01:15:02,500
Do it!

488
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:08,880
Man, l'm out of here.
Anybody that's coming, come on.

489
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:31,700
Cicero, this is Libby. Come in.

490
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:36,080
Cicero, this is Libby. Come in.

491
01:15:39,210 --> 01:15:42,880
lf you get killed,
will your man let us in?

492
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:46,130
Not if he's smart.

493
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:11,030
Do you want me to say l'm sorry?
Well, l'm not.

494
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:17,160
lt was a mistake.

495
01:16:17,330 --> 01:16:20,910
l'll kill you
before l let you make another one.

496
01:16:57,240 --> 01:17:00,700
Just got out of basic training,
didn't you?

497
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:06,460
lt's pretty obvious you're a rookie.

498
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:12,300
You think you're the centre
of the universe, but you're not.

499
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:16,720
We're just insignificant
little specks, you and me.

500
01:17:16,890 --> 01:17:21,100
We're not gonna change the world.

501
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:25,480
We're not gonna win the war.

502
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:29,480
Nobody's gonna care that we die.

503
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:36,410
"Which many signify that you should
snarl and bite and play the dog."

504
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:40,830
- Not me.
- Shakespeare?

505
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:43,040
Very good.

506
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:36,340
Cicero, this is Libby. Over.

507
01:18:36,510 --> 01:18:38,840
Cicero, come in. Over.

508
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:45,850
Goddamn radiation!
Come on, we've got to get closer.

509
01:18:55,400 --> 01:19:01,280
- Come on down.
- We're right in front of the door.

510
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:07,000
- Come out. Over.
- Bad connection, Joe.

511
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:11,000
l've got NEBs with me.
Come on up.

512
01:19:11,170 --> 01:19:14,340
You're breaking up, Joe.

513
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:24,220
- Come up out of the bunker.
- Come on down, Joe.

514
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:33,270
You come up, Chuck.

515
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:39,740
- Chuck, that's an order.
- Come on down. Over.

516
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:48,000
- Chuck...
- Come on down. Over.

517
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:53,960
- Let me speak to Don Giovanni.
- This is Don Giovanni.

518
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:58,220
Come on down. Over.

519
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:07,310
- This is your old pal Wolfgang.
- l will open the door. Over.

520
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:12,810
l'm coming down right now.
Do you copy?

521
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:18,690
- Come down. Over.
- l'm coming in... Go!

522
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:31,390
Watch the flame.

523
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:07,510
- Give me the nuke!
- What?

524
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:12,020
Give me the mini-pluto
you stole out of the bunker!

525
01:22:17,230 --> 01:22:21,360
- Loading.
- Watch your heads.

526
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:25,320
Hang on!

527
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:12,330
Help me!

528
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:29,380
- Help me!
- Sir!

529
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:35,020
Help me!

530
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:38,520
- Sir.
- l'm okay, Jefferson.

531
01:23:38,690 --> 01:23:44,520
- What about you?
- Becker's down. He's wounded.

532
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:49,860
Becker...

533
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:58,040
- He's wounded...
- Hold on, man.

534
01:23:58,210 --> 01:24:01,080
Wounded.

535
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:06,000
- Help me.
- Jefferson! No!

536
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:11,340
Down! Down to hell!
And say that l sent you there.

537
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:17,770
"l came into the world
with my legs forward."

538
01:24:17,930 --> 01:24:22,730
"And the woman cried,
'He was born with teeth!"'

539
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:50,420
l had no father.
l am my own father.

540
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:54,470
l have no brother
l am my own brother.

541
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:12,110
This word love,
which old farts call blind, -

542
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:16,320
- be resident in men like you,
asshole, but not in me.

543
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:20,790
l am my motherfucking self. Alone!

544
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:42,850
Jefferson!

545
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:53,450
We're gonna die.

546
01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:58,030
You know that, don't you?

547
01:26:05,370 --> 01:26:08,500
Yeah...

548
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:13,970
...but not today...

549
01:26:14,130 --> 01:26:18,600
...and not here.

550
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:23,310
Where will we go?

551
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:27,600
Where do you go
when there's nowhere else to go?

552
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:29,480
Home.

553
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:34,860
Earth.

554
01:26:35,030 --> 01:26:42,540
There's an emergency escape vehicle
for use by the commanding officer.

555
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:46,830
lt's hidden in these mountains
in a place named ironically -

556
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:55,300
- for where they developed the
first atomic bomb. Alamogordo.

557
01:26:55,470 --> 01:26:58,260
l've never been there.

558
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:03,930
- What are you talking about?
- There's a way off this planet.

559
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:15,610
- Type 2?
- Hell if l know.

560
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:20,450
l've never even seen this tag.
l've never even seen this language.

561
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:29,420
Can l see it?

562
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:37,090
Yeah.

563
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:47,020
God! l'm sorry.

564
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:51,940
Give it to me. l'm sorry.

565
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:59,030
l had to know.

566
01:27:59,570 --> 01:28:04,450
No! Don't do that...
you don't need to.

567
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:27,870
- That's the last one.
- lt's okay.

568
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:32,210
According to this
we should be close.

569
01:29:32,370 --> 01:29:36,790
- Does that locator work?
- Yeah.

570
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:40,760
- ls it up there?
- lt should be.

571
01:29:42,170 --> 01:29:46,430
- l don't see anything.
- That's the idea.

572
01:29:53,230 --> 01:29:58,520
l can't go on any more.
l don't want to go on any more.

573
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:10,080
Listen to me. l don't have anybody.

574
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:15,920
l don't have a family or a friend
or that kid Jefferson.

575
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:21,670
l don't even have him.
But l have you, do you hear me?

576
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:25,550
l have you, and we're going home.

577
01:30:29,810 --> 01:30:33,270
l'm taking you home.

578
01:30:47,530 --> 01:30:52,450
When l took over command,
this was coded in my bio-signature.

579
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:56,580
- lt only works for you?
- We'll soon find out.

580
01:31:03,710 --> 01:31:07,050
Then l'm with the right guy.

581
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:23,630
- What do we do?
- l have no idea.

582
01:32:23,790 --> 01:32:27,130
Let's try this chair.

583
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:31,890
What about this?

584
01:32:32,050 --> 01:32:35,220
Elevator activated.

585
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:40,310
Countdown to launch commencing.

586
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:44,230
lt's moving. Get on.

587
01:32:47,230 --> 01:32:51,660
Hang on.
The crane's blocking the trajectory.

588
01:32:51,820 --> 01:32:55,280
- l'll be down.
- Okay.

589
01:32:55,450 --> 01:33:00,620
Please clear launch pad.

590
01:33:02,170 --> 01:33:08,710
Gantry inoperable.
Circuit malfunction.

591
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:24,870
Launch sequence initiated.

592
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:29,000
Time to launch: 15 minutes.

593
01:34:51,610 --> 01:34:55,200
- Chuck!
- Remember that bar at Point Reyes?

594
01:34:56,490 --> 01:35:00,120
l guess you'll never see it again.

595
01:35:08,790 --> 01:35:12,250
We all die alone, Joe.

596
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,510
Like the new look, Commander?

597
01:35:56,670 --> 01:36:00,340
What do you think?
ls this me, or what?

598
01:36:00,510 --> 01:36:03,850
l liked the other face better.

599
01:36:04,010 --> 01:36:08,270
Do you know who l got it from?
Marshall Richard Cooper.

600
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:13,440
Name ring a bell?
Do you know how we got it off him?

601
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:17,280
Just like your buddy Chuck,
we ripped it off.

602
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:21,700
He was screaming
something about God and Jesus.

603
01:36:34,630 --> 01:36:38,300
You're in the wrong place.

604
01:36:38,470 --> 01:36:42,800
l took his face.
He didn't have much use for it.

605
01:36:42,970 --> 01:36:45,600
But l like your face better.

606
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:52,850
"She couldn't take it. She married
and moved on, and l'm still here."

607
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:01,490
Obstruction cleared.
Prelaunch proceeding.

608
01:37:01,660 --> 01:37:06,240
Down to hell,
and say that l sent you.

609
01:37:06,410 --> 01:37:11,670
"l came into the world
with my legs forward..."

610
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:01,920
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Let's go.

611
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:09,390
- Prelaunch sequence complete.
- Joe...

612
01:38:13,390 --> 01:38:16,690
- Damn.
- One seat. One life support system.

613
01:38:20,110 --> 01:38:25,910
Get in. We've got eight minutes
for you to get out of here.

614
01:38:26,070 --> 01:38:31,370
- You know how to fly it.
- lt'll fly by itself.

615
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:34,250
Shit!

616
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:42,550
l'll flip you for it.
Call it. Heads or sphinx.

617
01:38:42,710 --> 01:38:48,800
Rome, Egypt.
l'll flip it. You call it.

618
01:38:48,970 --> 01:38:52,270
All right, Cleopatra, l'll call it.
Rome.

619
01:38:56,520 --> 01:39:00,610
lt doesn't matter. You're going.

620
01:39:00,770 --> 01:39:04,190
Now, go.

621
01:39:12,950 --> 01:39:15,620
l can't...

622
01:39:15,790 --> 01:39:19,920
Pardon me, gentlemen,
would you mind taking that outside?

623
01:39:20,090 --> 01:39:23,210
Stray bullets
are bad for the inventory.

624
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:26,840
Jessica Hansen, Pittsburgh.
How do you do?

625
01:39:29,140 --> 01:39:32,430
We can smile, we can cry,
we can bleed.

626
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:35,350
We can fuck.

627
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:41,820
l wanted to tell you. l did.

628
01:39:55,410 --> 01:39:58,330
Not so fast.

629
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:55,220
Two minutes to launch.

630
01:41:03,860 --> 01:41:07,070
Hey, bitch!

631
01:41:35,430 --> 01:41:38,810
Prelaunch burn complete.
90 seconds to launch.

632
01:41:55,570 --> 01:42:00,620
l didn't want to...

633
01:42:00,790 --> 01:42:06,960
...go back with you. l was afraid.

634
01:42:07,130 --> 01:42:14,680
l know. You were afraid
of what you would do.

635
01:42:18,810 --> 01:42:22,810
You're coming up in the world.

636
01:42:22,980 --> 01:42:26,480
You've learned
how to kill each other now.

637
01:42:29,020 --> 01:42:37,820
l learned something else, too.
l learned to...

638
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:42,660
...love.

639
01:42:53,510 --> 01:42:57,180
30 seconds to launch.

640
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:17,910
This is Joseph Hendricksson
aboard EEVT 3. Over.

641
01:43:18,070 --> 01:43:20,660
Alliance San Francisco. Over.

642
01:43:20,830 --> 01:43:25,790
On a prelaunch, requesting
emergency clearance for Earth.

643
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:30,040
Cleared for Earth. Over.
