1
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,832
Cumfukius says: " If you
want to know a civilization..."

2
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,272
"...you should listen to its music."

3
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,708
Music can reveal you
everything about a place.

4
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,596
Istanbul is a bridge from
which 72 people passed

5
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,755
It is a town of contrasts.
Beautiful-ugly, cold-warm

6
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,752
...old-new, poor-rich,
everything is full of contrasts.

7
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,875
Great Istanbul...

8
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,956
Arrogant town, Byzantium!

9
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,910
We were raised listening to
Zeki Mouren and Pink Floyd.

10
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,870
We didn't like any of these and
we found a common place.

11
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,117
There is food here, apart
from this, nothing else.

12
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,118
I can drive you everywhere
you want in Istanbul.

13
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,598
Baxilar, Bakircoi, wherever you want.

14
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,429
I am Alexander Hake and i play bass.

15
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,835
I first came in Istanbul for "Head-On".

16
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,032
I recorded some songs for the movie.

17
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,030
From that time on, this town
and its music are attracting me.

18
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,119
For me, Istanbul was
and remains a mystery.

19
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,157
I decided to capture the
sounds of this city...

20
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,068
...to understand them.

21
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,035
I was well prepared. I travel
carrying a lot of microphones...

22
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,032
computer, programs,
hard discs, everything.

23
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,270
The first band i met was Baba Zula.

24
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,550
It is a psychedelic underground band.

25
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,595
They believe that surroundings
are affecting their music.

26
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,593
They want to perform for a
whole day in a boat in Bosporos.

27
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,796
I have almost become
member of Baba Zula.

28
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,629
In the beginning i only
wanted to record them...

29
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,510
but their bassist left.

30
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,596
As i said, i am a bass player
and i grabbed the chance.

31
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,920
What makes Istanbul
different, is Bosporus.

32
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,749
The sea that joins the two continents.

33
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,598
It was probably created
after the Cataclysm.

34
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,550
Watch this, Retsep.

35
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,435
They filled it with water.

36
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,239
It is a classic drums, just
like the one's in the West...

37
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,395
but instead of the
drum, i use "Darbouka".

38
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,197
I play it like "Darbouka", not like drum.

39
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,078
I use the West rhythm, playing at 9/8

40
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,873
In West music they play
at 2/4, 3/4 and 4/4...

41
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,713
in teams of three, just like 12/8.

42
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,630
These also exist in Turkish music...

43
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,518
but we use other kinds, like 5/8.

44
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,279
This is called "Turkish idiom".

45
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,030
You split it in 9.

46
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,232
Example of Turkish
music, that Turks use...

47
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,679
...and Iranians...

48
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,948
It's not too connected.

49
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,351
Thank you very much.

50
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,355
What more to say about Istanbul?

51
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,949
It belongs to Asia and Europe.

52
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,999
It is East and West. But
this is an advantage.

53
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,949
We want to be Europeans...

54
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,832
but at the same time we
belong to Asia too. It is in us.

55
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,635
We are both, that what i want to believe.

56
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,668
Ahmend already responded.

57
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,998
Whoever tries to be European, is not.

58
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,515
We are Asians. We are nomadic tribe.

59
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,995
We are what we are.
Especially the musicians.

60
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,954
Station Oxygen, 95,9.

61
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,592
We are DJ Yakuza and Murat Onguog Lu.

62
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,151
Our first song is Orient Expressions.

63
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,715
Istanbul 1:26 a.m.

64
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,230
When you are DJ here...

65
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,997
you watch what happens
in South, East, West

66
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,440
...in America, everywhere.

67
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,557
There, things are more limited...

68
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,877
In the USA, the music
store is at the corner...

69
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,672
...stations are local and DJ's
do not have so many options.

70
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,749
But when you live here, you
ears are open to everything...

71
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,880
whether you like it or not.

72
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,879
For us, it is no problem
to go with West or East.

73
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,875
It is not something that you can't bridge.

74
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,310
The fact that they are two
totally different things

75
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,036
and that they do not meet, is nonsense!

76
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,830
It's a historical lie. Something that...

77
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,557
those who have the power are
growing, through the centuries.

78
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,676
Those who say these things...

79
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,157
...just like those in the White House...

80
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,392
...they mention the existence
of a political chasm.

81
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,189
After the dispelling of the Soviet Union...

82
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,678
...they had to find something
else that will cause terror...

83
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,112
...and it took them 6-7 years to find it...

84
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,069
...and they discovered a new enemy.

85
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,198
I don't believe that East
starts from Istanbul...

86
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,280
...and reaches till China.

87
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,996
And that West ranges from
Greece and reaches L.A.

88
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,429
I live in Beig Lou. That's
where everything started.

89
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,115
I believe that i discovered
Istanbul through Beig Lou.

90
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,757
The first thing you meet
, is Instical Cantesi.

91
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,829
The "Highway of Liberty",
which is always full of traffic.

92
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,916
It ranges from Taxim square, up to Tunel.

93
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,591
Slowly i discovered the
life in the side-roads...

94
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,789
all the clubs, discotheques...

95
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,470
...the hot part of the town.

96
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,714
20 years ago...

97
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,710
no one dared to visit Beig Lou...

98
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,359
it wasn't good, neither for families
nor for young people to visit.

99
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,396
We used to say, "We won't
go to eat in Beig Lou".

100
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,672
Now, everybody wants to go there.

101
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,358
Duman, "Smoke", is one
of the rock bands there.

102
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,195
Istanbul is rock.

103
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,315
There are many clubs
that play rock music.

104
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,549
The singer of Duman,
has been in Seattle.

105
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,273
There, he first performed
in Turkish for the first time.

106
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,311
The town lives with raki and
smokes many cigarettes.

107
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,515
The town lives in the
day and loves the night.

108
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,989
Men are swearing, and
the town hits women.

109
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,794
The town sucks our blood,
but it's worth dying for.

110
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,637
Istanbul kisses your hand.

111
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,712
One and a half year ago, the people
were wondering, if Turkish rock exist.

112
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,511
No one wonders anymore.
This is becoming gradually.

113
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,432
These are Replica... from Beig Lou too.

114
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,719
They like gentler noise...

115
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,149
Back from 90's, rock is in the town.

116
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,079
By the end of the decade,
more genres existed.

117
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,357
We live in a very weird town.

118
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,435
We were raised with the same way...

119
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,275
...like the teenagers in West.

120
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,076
We couldn't understand our
local music till we were 19.

121
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,469
Then it was the first time we saw...

122
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,077
...that we were ignoring Turkish music...

123
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,433
and we got interested with it.

124
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,190
Knowing where you live, you feel safety.

125
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,476
We play music this way.

126
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,313
When we understood this...

127
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,390
we were affected mostly by Erkin Korai.

128
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,629
We understood some things
, and he became our idol.

129
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,351
I can say "He opened every door for us"

130
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,309
We found the Turkish music,
and we finally understood it.

131
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,709
What are you saying?

132
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,869
He is our father.

133
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,029
He was one of the first.

134
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,315
Back then, his way of life
was disturbing the people.

135
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,800
They considered him suspicious.

136
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,190
"Don't play this kind of music,
don't offend the people".

137
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,150
Erkin Korai stopped his
daughter from going to school.

138
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,832
Am I the only one suffering...

139
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,872
in the dark of the night?

140
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,839
On my eyes, seaweeds grow.

141
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,273
When I started, I was all alone.

142
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,312
I have been the only one for years,
i still feel like this sometimes.

143
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,118
Now there are new bands
that play good Turkish rock.

144
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,951
They begin to play good things.

145
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,396
I was crying all night long...

146
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,391
...waves hit on me.

147
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,789
On my eyes, seaweeds grow...

148
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,432
in the tempo of loneliness.

149
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,595
From the first time
I encountered difficulties.

150
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,319
Even today, I can't do what I want.

151
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,956
I have always been a
little extreme for Turkey.

152
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,716
Thank you very much!

153
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,199
I hope to see you soon!

154
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,677
I am on the search of
black music in Istanbul.

155
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,438
That's the East coast of Istanbul.

156
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,356
I am going to meet a
serious man and his family.

157
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,512
I am going to say what i
want, for the last time.

158
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,112
I won't hesitate.

159
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,950
Whoever doesn't know himself, is boring.

160
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,672
What i am going to tell
you, is like a strong fist.

161
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,554
If you look at me, you'll
stop being so tough.

162
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,072
My rhythm is always right
and everything is going well.

163
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,790
I help my friends, I'm
knocking down my enemies.

164
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,880
I am like the tornado
and i have a big heart.

165
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,750
I fly like the wind. I am
Seza and i play good music.

166
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,796
The bad technique is lethal.

167
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,510
Look at me and grow a little bit...

168
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,750
My music is rap, try
it and come with me.

169
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,794
But first you have to see Holocaust.

170
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,717
Maybe my lyrics offend
you. I am sorry pal.

171
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,558
Some people that believe
it's Nostradamus...

172
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,032
they need a nightmare like me.

173
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,630
Show me the Holocaust.

174
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,317
That's hip-hop, God punished it with me.

175
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,834
It's a nice little shop.

176
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,188
That's what people like.
Downstairs is a tattoo store.

177
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,556
What's up bro? It's ours. The Engin.

178
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,150
We are making tattoos
to whoever comes here.

179
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,479
You got a customer. Pay attention.

180
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,916
Male rappers are many
more than female.

181
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,514
Women are not interested, or
they are not confident enough.

182
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,958
Or they don't like rap.

183
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,195
Flies go to the rubbish, just
like the American discs.

184
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,315
Is this rap?

185
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,509
We don't want young MC, girls.
Why so many people play bad rap?

186
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,152
A present for you. I'm crashing
everyone I don't like, like a fly.

187
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,757
Every fly dies, your place is in the toilet.

188
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,914
You have 30 seconds to get lost.

189
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,310
My brother is great.
We are mostly friends.

190
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,196
Elif knows this too.
Everybody is looking up to us.

191
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,036
We share everything.

192
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,118
He is the one and only.

193
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,077
Gangsta is something from America.

194
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,918
Gangsta rap and mafia do not exist here.

195
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,758
We are different.

196
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,319
We rap about anything.

197
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,629
"We are gangsta, we kill".
We do nothing like this.

198
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,634
We are the one's we are.

199
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,879
Hip-hop is money, girls and gangsta crap.

200
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,114
I didn't even think of it.

201
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,477
Sound is the same, the
topics are more serious...

202
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,713
...and everybody is interested in them.

203
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,271
My name is Caesar. I
import these wheels.

204
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,150
They cost 15.000.000. I
sell them for 50.000.000.

205
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,636
I am a Turk.

206
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,516
I am now living in USA. I
lived for 2 years in Dubai.

207
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,520
We want to be real. I am leaving!

208
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,749
People say, "Watch them,
they want to be Americans."

209
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,876
They do what they want. That's
what we do in the name of Turkey.

210
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,429
We don't accuse them. They
don't know anything else.

211
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,397
But we will eventually
make up their minds.

212
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,351
I am not going to change.

213
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,230
I don't want to accuse them.

214
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,440
They are like our parents.

215
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,993
My mother always says, watch
your pants. It's a shame.

216
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,560
You have to understand how they think.

217
00:26:47,595 --> 00:26:49,630
The poster says...

218
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,518
"Sadam Hussein servant"

219
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,197
We want to approach the new people...

220
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,395
...to make them breakdance,
to avoid bad habits.

221
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,470
Our days are dangerous.

222
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,038
Pills, drugs and heroin everywhere.

223
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,790
Breakdance fights them.

224
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,673
I listened to hip-hop for the first
time when my son went to school.

225
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,114
I asked him, "What kind of music is this?"

226
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,355
We knew Eric Clapton
and Jimmy Hendrix.

227
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,870
For me, music comes
along with the lyrics.

228
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,791
These people talk nonsense,
that's how i got it.

229
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,633
But i came to understand,
when i heard Turkish hip-hop.

230
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,839
It's better than pop. It is
going to last a long time.

231
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,278
I think that Turkey needs hip-hop music.

232
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,596
Let's make this live.

233
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,194
You will get on stage,
when we will be singing...

234
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,400
...and in the end, we will sing "a capella".

235
00:29:39,435 --> 00:29:42,358
They are three musicians.

236
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,275
Illiterate.

237
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,748
They are 15, 19 and 21 years old.

238
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,399
They take care of their family,
they survive by playing music.

239
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,431
What I am searching for is
the immobility in the centre.

240
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,713
Like in the eye of the cyclone.

241
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,675
You have to find this place...

242
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,630
where you easier go round
rather you stay still.

243
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,312
The time when your
body is going round...

244
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,399
your spirit goes somewhere else.

245
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,874
The black cape that i wear...

246
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,478
...symbolizes our tomb.

247
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,269
I am wearing a "sike".

248
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,154
It's the tombstone.

249
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:53,116
And the shirt is called "tenoure".

250
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,277
It symbolizes our shroud.

251
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,871
Right hand up, Left hand down.

252
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,997
With the right hand we take from
god, with the left hand we give.

253
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:16,277
We are supposed to give
what we take from God.

254
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,310
We are in the middle.

255
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,953
If we wanted to include the
whole teaching in one word...

256
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,518
...this would be "tolerance".

257
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,479
There is a big difference,
not concerning the song...

258
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,436
...but in the feelings, in Turkish music...

259
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,836
...more common...

260
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,192
...than in the English music...

261
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,870
Which are the lyrics?

262
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,552
From the song "Her window in the Street"

263
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,194
It's on the first side.

264
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:41,119
Before i came to Turkey, they
gave me one great cassette.

265
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,475
Old recordings of Turkish
musicians in Bulgaria...

266
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,198
...during 50's and 60's.

267
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,115
I was looking for something like this.

268
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,640
I had the chance to find it...

269
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,710
...when i was performing
with Muamar Ketansiog Lou.

270
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,029
One friend of mine, driveddrove
me from town to town.

271
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,990
...and i was asking the people.

272
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,150
Do you have something like this?
And they were finding for me.

273
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,355
It was weird.

274
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,189
Under the dust...

275
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,194
...there were many discs.

276
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,999
I listened to them, and
thought, "How nice songs!"

277
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,159
These flowers will be
out to the sun again.

278
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,634
I chose some of them, and
i began to work with Selim.

279
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,754
Her window is in the road.

280
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,275
Those who are passing
by, they throw stones.

281
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,433
My darling, with the perfect eyebrows.

282
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,753
Find her, and count your money.

283
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,076
One woman came, from Canada.

284
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,950
She made a long journey...

285
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,911
...and she tried to sing this music.

286
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,956
She told me, we never
appreciated these kind of things.

287
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,996
And you consider them valuable.

288
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,078
We feel shame and happiness.

289
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,315
The nice rhythms are weird...

290
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,349
...but charming too.

291
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:22,400
There is pain, but happiness in music too.

292
00:37:22,435 --> 00:37:25,995
You may not understand the lyrics...

293
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,355
...but you feel the same,
happiness and pain.

294
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,279
He has got one blue truck.

295
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,111
I am nicely dressed.

296
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,948
I can't hide my happiness.

297
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,879
Find her, and count your money.

298
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,197
I know Selim Sesler for a long time.

299
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,798
We first met each other in "Head-On", we
worked there together for the first time.

300
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,791
We are heading to Kesan. Selims town.

301
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,033
Kesan is West, near the Greek borders.

302
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,030
2/3 of the population are gypsies.

303
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,036
They like "fazel" very much.

304
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,552
They meet in bars and they get drunk.

305
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,870
The music there is very good.

306
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:25,072
In the past, there was an
Arab in Spain that played Uti.

307
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,316
I think his name was Flamo
Mege or something like this.

308
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,119
He was playing like this.

309
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,430
Everybody started imitating him,
and the name was named this way.

310
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,438
They started playing guitar,
just like he was playing Uti.

311
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:50,798
This is Uti, that's where all
stringed instruments derive from.

312
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,232
He knows to play very good.

313
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,472
Gypsy music and Turkish
music are very different.

314
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,909
There is no comparison between
them. When you listen to gypsies...

315
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,274
you can't just sit down,
you want to dance.

316
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,718
This is gypsies music.

317
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,469
The traditional Turkish music...

318
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,354
you just listen to it.

319
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,993
When talking about gypsies, I say...

320
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,276
"God should have made
all people gypsies".

321
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,831
The summer in Kesan,
is a wedding period.

322
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,551
Every night, at least one wedding
takes place, somewhere.

323
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,199
Here, the bride is dressed in
black. She farewells her family...

324
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,958
They know nothing...

325
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,279
...because they don't want to know.

326
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,315
They know nothing...

327
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,309
...because they don't want to know.

328
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,239
Look at them, the world is theirs.

329
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,156
If you are not one of them,
they call you a bad guy.

330
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,036
Don't listen to them my friend.

331
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:21,196
The fact with hard drugs,
is that they are new here.

332
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,628
They just started to appear here.

333
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,874
Stop it.

334
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,189
- How are you Halil?
- I am fine, thanks.

335
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,429
Too low for me.

336
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,037
When you are high, you
forget how you have to live.

337
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,590
That's how it was.

338
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,714
I will tell you about street music.

339
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,557
We were playing in Taxim
square, then in French Institute...

340
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,509
...at Mis Street, Cinema Emek...

341
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,270
and in Galatasarai square, at Ontakoule.

342
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,316
They threw us out of Tunel.

343
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,037
We understood that street music,
matches the European style.

344
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,910
They left us here.

345
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,835
Police doesn't touches us.

346
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,510
It is a game though.

347
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:25,477
We play in this European game as well.

348
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,037
They don't understand, we want to be
in touch with the rest of the world...

349
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,075
...and we prefer, to play in the street.

350
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,830
They would like us to make
a record, and perform live.

351
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,671
It is of no importance what
you sing or if it has a meaning.

352
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:57,836
The things that count are the
appearance and the voice.

353
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,393
I believe that music can
change some things.

354
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,317
Music is one of these things
that can change the world.

355
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:36,470
Street is a neutral zone.

356
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,473
That's why it unites the people.

357
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:46,035
Whatever your social class is.

358
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,230
That's why it's so important.

359
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:53,156
The one who takes
drugs, sticks with us...

360
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,515
but our music touches the
one with the laptop too.

361
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,315
We bring them close.

362
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,390
And sometimes we
leave, letting them talk.

363
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,152
They have to face the situation alone.

364
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,716
The black boy asked,
"What happened to us?

365
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,073
Her love is holy for me.

366
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:39,479
I wish i could hug her for one night.

367
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,197
I would give my life for this.

368
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:02,397
But there is poverty.

369
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,953
You have to fight it.

370
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:11,397
It's hard to talk about
the cement feeling.

371
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:17,553
When Erkin Korai sings
for Agura Roads...

372
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,114
...and sidewalks...

373
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:30,193
...he idealizes them. Whoever
lives in the streets knows that.

374
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,554
Cement is cement.

375
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,875
When you lie on it, then you really feel it.

376
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:55,590
The sound of the river
that flows is loud...

377
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:59,909
...just like the sound of my tears.

378
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,392
You haven't come back for months...

379
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,674
...my love.

380
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,719
You left me suddenly...

381
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,439
...my love.

382
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:07,679
In Dardanellia, 250000
people were killed.

383
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,038
In Tsanakale, during a small battle.

384
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:16,629
According to the legend, the
battlefield was a blood lake.

385
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:21,428
That night, a star was near the moon.

386
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:25,471
Someone -can't remember his name...

387
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:30,073
...saw the image of the moon
and the star in the blood.

388
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,911
That's where the
Turkish flag comes from.

389
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:38,873
It belongs to everyone.

390
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:43,519
Why should only fascists use it?

391
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:51,593
To record Ainour, we visited
a 18th century hamam.

392
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,834
It was like a cathedral.

393
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,830
The excellent acoustic
help us very much.

394
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,870
The Kurds matter exists for centuries.

395
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,558
Kurds want to keep their language...

396
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:33,158
...keep their civilization,
remember their history.

397
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,279
We live in Turkish Republic.

398
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,117
The situation was not easy,
and as a result Kurdish music...

399
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:45,315
...language and
civilization was forbidden.

400
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,116
A new law decide after the 1980 coup.

401
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,148
...that was forbidding
the music of minorities.

402
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,552
English, French and German
music was allowed...

403
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:01,635
but music of another
Turkish tribe was forbidden.

404
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:06,353
We believe that prohibiting
native language is crazy.

405
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:17,235
Ahmet...

406
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,197
...i admire you...

407
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:33,393
...even if you are not teacher or judge.

408
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:42,749
My pain, is god's pain.

409
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:49,239
Spring rain...

410
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,754
...it's not May, neither April nor March.

411
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,710
I suffer in the chest of God.

412
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,039
10 years ago, i wanted
to go to my country.

413
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:11,190
I had my army problems solved.

414
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:16,710
The journey was endless.
Every 50km they checked us.

415
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,554
There was a big sign.

416
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:24,396
If you love the forest,
you love your country.

417
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:29,153
I saw it, the water,
and the forest burning.

418
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,597
They burned our homes,
despite we fought...

419
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,949
...for the liberation of the country.

420
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:43,319
How can they consider us enemies?

421
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,112
How they can call us enemies?

422
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,638
I suffer very much...

423
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:09,236
...and i am missing my country.

424
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,749
Whatever i feel and live, are in my music.

425
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,552
What makes the difference
in Kurdish music, are laments.

426
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:22,277
They talk about the pain someone felt...

427
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:27,831
...war, separation, disaster.

428
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,749
That's what they are about.

429
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,200
My love...

430
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:54,995
...this night is so dark
that i can't see you.

431
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,675
When i first started as a musician...

432
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:15,512
...i performed in Kurdish at Mercin.

433
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:20,553
They took my "sazi" three
times from my hands.

434
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:27,030
10 years ago it was bad,
now we perform everywhere.

435
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:33,312
The prohibition of Kurdish
language extinctedbecame extinct in 1990...

436
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:37,157
but back then, there
were no music videos.

437
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,719
They began to broadcast
via TV months ago.

438
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:45,431
And this because they wanted to comply
with the rules of the European Union.

439
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,713
Politicians should have
made these changes...

440
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,874
...longlong ago.

441
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,716
We have been living
together all these centuries.

442
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:04,592
Civilization, language and
religion should be respected.

443
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,670
That is what we believe in.

444
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:58,550
With eagerness we get
close to Orhan Gensebai...

445
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,157
...one of the biggest starts in Turkey.

446
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:05,233
Not only he has sold
thousands of discs...

447
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,758
...but he has also starred
in numerous movies.

448
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,272
Gkensebai, who have
never appeared live...

449
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,228
...agreed to perform for us.

450
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:19,232
Undress... or should i undress you?

451
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,228
Woman, I have never
sinned like this before.

452
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,837
Come back to your village.

453
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,632
Go away!

454
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,838
That's my organ.

455
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:10,109
It's called "Orhan Baba",
that's how kids call it.

456
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:15,597
It's 38 years old, with this i
have composed all my songs.

457
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,430
For me, it's invaluable.

458
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,190
It's the one i trust.

459
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:24,197
There is no soul without sin...

460
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:29,951
...lovelove me despite my faults.

461
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:35,353
There is no disease that can't be cured...

462
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,351
...pity my pain.

463
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,994
I am lost...

464
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,353
...please...

465
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,590
...find me.

466
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,949
I am tired and i don't
have more strength...

467
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,716
...come and hug me.

468
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:13,474
The pain dried me my strength...

469
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:19,470
...listen to me, without complaining.

470
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:23,199
For lovers sake...

471
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,679
...please...

472
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,908
...lovelove me.

473
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:35,398
Love me.

474
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:57,239
Orhan Gensebai is a very
important musician...

475
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:01,435
...and he brought music
with sazi in cities.

476
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:06,399
Before him, sazi was something local.

477
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:11,439
With him, i think that some
things really started to change.

478
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,397
In 1934, Turkish radio stations...

479
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:18,629
were not allowed to
broadcast Turkish music...

480
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:22,311
...and those who felt
connected with Islamic world...

481
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,952
...were listening to Arabic radio stations.

482
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:29,717
The word "arabesque"
means "Arabic affected".

483
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:33,397
It was established back
then and re-appeared

484
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,356
in the 60's, it hadn't to do only with me...

485
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,754
but it was disparaging and
it was always offending me.

486
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:44,750
It's just not correct.

487
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,231
We incorporated a technique...

488
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:03,233
...from the Egyptian
music, which is like ours...

489
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,917
...one technique that comes from West.

490
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,593
That was not very
common in Turkish music.

491
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:16,239
We wanted to make our music richer.

492
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:21,273
Of course, some people tried
to prevent us from doing this.

493
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,788
They wanted to keep the old traditions.

494
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,869
No one worked on this besides us.

495
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:49,156
When i did it, i didn't spoil our heritage.

496
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,155
This civilization, tradition, still exist.

497
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:54,830
We are all protecting them.

498
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:29,353
They said tables were covered with sin...

499
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,238
...with lovers wine.

500
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:42,159
I am drinking all my life...

501
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:47,071
...that's my sin.

502
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,878
Who cares?

503
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:54,872
Crazy...

504
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:59,311
...that's my sin.

505
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:03,078
Who cares?

506
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:13,640
I have been singing for 72 years now.

507
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:17,398
Me and my voice are 86 years old.

508
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,235
I am a woman of Istanbul.

509
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:39,431
I was born in Bursa and i have been
living in Ouskountar since i was 10.

510
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:45,956
I have been singing since
i was a child in Bursa.

511
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:51,512
But i couldn't talk till i became 10.

512
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:54,715
I was stuttering.

513
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:58,870
I had to talk fast, so that no one
understands what i was saying.

514
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,957
Stutters can sing, but they can't talk.

515
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:22,473
They used to call me Mouzegien Senar...

516
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,754
...but they have forgotten me.

517
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,557
Only Sezen Axou, organised
a performance for me.

518
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:34,359
It was great. I thank
her very much for this.

519
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:46,996
Sezen Axou is like a goddess,
the most famous singer.

520
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:51,873
For me, it mixes up
pop and Turkish music.

521
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:57,072
She has discovered many
new singers, just like Tarkan.

522
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,958
All the people in the country love
her, at least they respect her.

523
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,274
Brother Orxan is here!

524
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:15,388
He is so rude!

525
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:19,749
Who does he think he is? Stupid!

526
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,070
- She composes very good songs.
- We listen to her for years now.

527
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:30,832
I never denied playing
a song of Sezen Axou.

528
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,757
Never.

529
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,631
I admire her since i was a child.

530
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:42,359
Many important songs in my life are hers.

531
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:47,349
She is a very important singer.

532
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,275
She reminds me of my first years.

533
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:59,033
After many meetings,
we began to record.

534
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:03,475
We got a song of her, from the 80's...

535
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,788
...which is classic for
Istanbul of the past.

536
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:11,396
Rehearsal begins.

537
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:04,320
An old painting is hanging on the wall...

538
01:16:04,355 --> 01:16:08,438
...maybe it's finished maybe not.

539
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:14,399
She is sitting at Markiz and stares at it...

540
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:19,393
...with the dust of time on her eyes.

541
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:28,277
What a love, what a sadness.

542
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:33,790
With this song, my soul
breaks into a thousand pieces.

543
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:41,835
Her cheeks are like withered roses...

544
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:48,155
this sadness, this moment of love.

545
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:53,278
Like a lyric she never pronounced...

546
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,668
...pure love.

547
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,915
One autumn day...

548
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:08,434
...painted in many colours...

549
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:12,795
She wants to live one day like this...

550
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:17,598
...to see the yellow leaves of her dreams.

551
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,479
The remembrance of Istanbul...

552
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:30,353
...is deeply inside her.

553
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:55,198
If i was a nightingale in here garden...

554
01:17:56,720 --> 01:18:01,191
i would sing for you all my songs.

555
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:07,873
My soul wouldn't have
the strength for wars.

556
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:45,995
It's time for me to leave.

557
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,199
I couldn't understand this city.

558
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,433
I could only scratch its surface.

559
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:57,552
One thing is for sure. I
loved the music of Istanbul.

560
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,151
If I was a seagull...

561
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:12,239
...I would fly above all the seas.

562
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,470
I would let wind guide me...

563
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:20,391
...and I would travel far.

564
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:27,677
My soul would be free.
