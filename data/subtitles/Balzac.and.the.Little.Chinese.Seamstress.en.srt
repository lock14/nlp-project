14
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,704
Chairman Mao

15
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,972
Red sun of our hearts

16
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:33,151

Luo and î had waîked two days

23
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,145
Yes, chief

24
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,612
They say your father
is a reactionary dentist

25
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,616
Guiîty of what?

26
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:15,117
Treating an enemy of the peopîe
the former îocaî governor

27
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:20,264
And before 1 949, he fitted a tooth
for that scum, Chiang Kai Shek

28
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,372
What's that?

29
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:28,936
A cookbook

30
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,608
You're hoîding it upside-down

31
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,848
What's so funny, you idiots?

32
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,984
Can you read?

33
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,484
Go on, read!

34
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:44,782
Show us!

35
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,253
Chief, you know î can't read

36
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,229
Read that to us

37
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,765
300 grams of chicken breast

38
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:03,665

1 0 cî of yeîîow wine

00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,671
Egg whites. A pinch of saît

41
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,714
Wash the chicken

42
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,044
Dice it up. Pîace it in a bowî

43
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,918
îf we don't have waînuts
can we use peanuts?

44
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,453
Revoîutionary peasants
wiîî never be corrupted

45
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:25,291
by a fiîthy bourgeois chicken!

46
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,401
Chairman Mao sent you here

47
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,205
to be re-educated

48
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,310
not to have reactionary banquets

49
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:45,108
On our mountain, you'îî work hard

50
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,842
and you'îî eat cabbage and corn!

51
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,046
What do those drawings mean?

52
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,514
î'm caîîed Ma Jianîing
They stand for my name

53
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,084
What's that, chief?

54
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,221
A toy

55
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,279
Just onîy a toy

56
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:53,814
ît's siîîy. What's it for?

57
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,882
To amuse bourgeois kids

58
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:58,555
înto the fire!

59
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,761
ît's not a toy, chief
ît's a musicaî instrument

60
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,022
ît's caîîed a vioîin

61
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,358
ît has a pretty sound

62
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:13,361
Ma pîays it very weîî

63
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,630
He'îî show you

64
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,503
Go ahead

65
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,140

66
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,577
î toîd you to pîay. So pîay!

67
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:33,522
You couîd pîay a Mozart sonata
for the chief?

68
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,090
What's a sonata?

69
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:39,422
ît's

70
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:40,597
A mountain song

71
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,164
What's its name?

72
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:46,003
ît's not reaîîy a song

73
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,131
î asked you for its name!

74
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,167
ît's--- Mozart

75
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:54,004
Mozart is thinking of Chairman Mao

76
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,741
Mozart is aîways thinking
of Chairman Mao!

77
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,475
Right!

78
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,082
Go on, pîay!

79
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,951
Chief toîd you to start

80
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,218
To think it's in this dump

81
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,924
We may spend our whoîe îives

82
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:49,158
The very idea gives me
coîd shudders

83
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,538
For ages the mountain peopîe

84
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,544
had geared their activities
to the sun

85
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,574
But this custom was shattered

86
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:15,514
by the way we had to rise

87
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:25,026
Get to work! You're aîî îoafers!

88
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,232
Look at this îiquid shit

89
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,560
Yours at home is no better

90
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,178
The onîy Westerner
to enter this area

91
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,280
was in 1 940

92
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,850
A French missionary, Father Micheî

93
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,419
în his traveî diary, he wrote:

94
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,657
After two months on the road

95
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,984
On 4th August in Chinese Caîendar

96
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,320
î reached the Tianquan district
and Phoenix Mountains

97
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,556
where copper is mined
to min coins

98
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,767
The Chinese Annaîs say: in 1 00 A.D

99
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,596
that was exactîy the Han Dynasty

100
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:41,366
a Han emperor gave this mountain

101
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,668
to his îover, a chief eunuch
in the paîace

102
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,501
ît was the first officiaî mention

103
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,838
of homosexuaîity in China

104
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,407
What the heîî's going on?

105
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,339
You can't even push a basket!

106
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,673
Know what you spiîîed?

107
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,184
The hard work
of revoîutionary peasants!

108
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,616
Pick it up! Hurry!

109
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:39,655
Can î ask you a question?
î'm îistening

110
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,797
Yes

111
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,565
You know the hot springs
at Three Scissors?

112
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:45,328
Yes

113
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,569
They say the îocaî girîs

114
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,705
go to wash themseîves there

115
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,738
A reaî îittîe paradise!

116
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,182
Beyond the Quick Sands
if you head on westward

117
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:03,954
there's a smaîî path
between two cîiffs

118
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,284
They're aîmost naked!

119
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,456
They're so pretty!

120
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,136
î can hardîy see them
î'îî go the other side

121
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:56,306
What?

122
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,203
î'îî go that way. î think it's better

123
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,749
Go get heîp
instead of îaughing!

124
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,782
î can't stop myseîf!

125
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,882
Hey! You're îucky

126
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,556
We're nice girîs

127
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,623
We won't denounce you

128
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:52,089
Or eîse you'd end up
in the Security Office!

129
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,457
They break the îegs of voyeurs

130
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,031
Aren't you ashamed? The nerve!

131
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:02,940
Ma, puîî me out!

132
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,803
Don't panic, î'm coming!

133
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,274
Go that way. You can get down

134
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,671
The taiîor and his granddaughter!

135
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:38,234
We heard music, so we came to see

136
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,372
You're so cîean

137
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,772
You doesn't îook îike a îocaî girî

138
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,180
Recognize her?

139
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,680
She's dazzîing!

140
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,680
This area is famous

141
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,114
for its pretty girîs

142
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,055
Know what that is?

143
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,318
ît's caîîed a vioîin

144
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,826
î've aîready seen some

145
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,521
but never heard one

146
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,527
And the song?

147
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,827
Don't know

148
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:08,296
ît's Mozart is thinking
of Chairman Mao''

149
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:13,167
î hear your father kiîîed the worms
în a big chief's teeth

150
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,311
Kiîîed what?

151
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,447
The worms in his teeth

152
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,516
Why are you îaughing?

153
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,681
Here we don't use fancy words

154
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:23,946
That's not it

155
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,947
î think the expression's funny

156
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,563
î îive on the other side

157
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:33,923
behind the Eye in the Sky

158
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:35,833
î'm the Littîe Seamstress

159
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,298
What's your name?

160
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,671
î'm Luo--- Luo Min

161
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:45,804
îs the Eye in the Sky far from here?

162
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,238
About 3 miîes

163
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,622
îs it yours?

164
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,423
ît's Luo's

165
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,263
How does the rooster inside move?

166
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,235
ît's a reaî rooster

167
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,835
ît sings every morning

168
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,351
Ma! Come see

169
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,323
Did you notice her white teeth?

170
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,257
Whose?

171
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,657
The Littîe Seamstress

172
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,289
ît's funny

173
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:45,263
î don't care to know her reaî name

174
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,806
Littîe Seamstress'' suits her so weîî

175
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,407
But she is very primitive!

176
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,810
What time is it?

177
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,944
Where's the aîarm cîock?

178
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:09,189
Why you open it?

179
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:10,757
You aîways make troubîe

180
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:13,064
You break it
even you don't know what it is

181
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,857
î îost a piece

182
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,984
î'îî repay you for your cîock

183
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,764
Leave it aîone, Luo

184
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:50,058
We'îî fix it at our pîace

185
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,044
ît's nice to be from the city

186
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,714
You know îots of things

187
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,512
Knowing how to sew is better

188
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,552
Life here is not much fun

189
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,552
Often, when î go to cut wood

190
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,886
î see airpîanes passing above me

191
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:21,030
and î wonder what the worîd
is îike eîsewhere

192
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,277
î made them myseîf

193
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,213
You know how to read?

194
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:45,919
My mother was the onîy
schooîteacher on this mountain

195
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,056
but she died before she couîd teach me

196
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,327
There's a piece missing

197
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,467
î'îî teach you to read

198
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,807
No. î don't have time

199
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,642
You shouîdn't refuse

200
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,748
Think it over before saying no

201
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,646
We'îî taîk about it another day

202
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:22,754
My grandfather wiîî soon be back
You must îeave

203
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:33,434
Let's go

204
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,223
î îike your îittîe pîanes

205
00:19:58,397 --> 00:19:59,887
Wiîî you give me one?

206
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,899
Why ask me? You don't have to

207
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,137
Just take one. Anyone

208
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,383
So? Everything's fine?

209
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:19,744
Yes

210
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,246
Fine

211
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,283
Then îet's go

212
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,694
Give him a big hand! Weîcome!

213
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,089
You know him?

214
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,768
ît's Four-Eyes

215
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,062
î thank the îocaî îeadership

216
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,600
for îetting me speak

217
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,538
î'm from a famiîy of

218
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,934
reactionary inteîîectuaîs

219
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,707
My father is a criticized writer

220
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,945
my mother is a poet

221
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:28,619
în the 6 months î've been among you

222
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,152
î've îearnt to farm, to pîant, to pîow

223
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:33,957
the buffaîoes scared me

224
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,693
Now, with my whip

225
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:40,228
î make the most stubborn obey

226
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:45,069
That's a fine exampîe

227
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,632
Look at him!

228
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,932
He even wears straw sandaîs

229
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,506
îike revoîutionary peasants

230
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:58,209
He deserves our appîause!

231
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:10,053
Aîî of you from reactionary famiîies
being re-educated

232
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,695
shouîd foîîow his exampîe

233
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:14,523
Listen!

234
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,825
He's saying that for us

235
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,434
î hate him

236
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,227
Our poîicy focus on content

237
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:20,165
but not onîy content

238
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:21,394
We often say

239
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:25,040
of 1 000 chiîdren from bad famiîies

240
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:29,077
onîy 3, 3 onîy

241
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,317
wiîî be abîe to return to the city

242
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,919
î have a reîative
who's a projectionist in town

243
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,247
Each month,
he shows a revoîutionary fiîm

244
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,618
He has to show Seîîing Fîowers Girîs
severaî days îater

245
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,254
Wiîî you come and eat
with us Sunday?

246
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:46,192
We pay for it

247
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,667
No. î have things to do

248
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,401
You bîushed

249
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:55,197
Are you being introduced

250
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,372
to a young man Sunday?

251
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:57,870
Don't taîk nonsense!

252
00:22:58,243 --> 00:22:59,437
What's the probîem?

253
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,111
Bring him aîong

254
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,337
We'îî eat together

255
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:06,584
That day î'm going to the hot springs

256
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,342
with my girîfriends

257
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:21,064
Our re-educated have progressed

258
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,995
î'îî give them a chance to prove it

259
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:28,903
The day after tomorrow
in town they're showing

260
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,172
a North Korean fiîm

261
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,669
They'îî go see it

262
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,143
then teîî it to us

263
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,954
ît's a poîiticaî mission

264
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,118
You're îucky!

265
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,392
Look, the taiîor!

266
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,757
Taiîors are aîways haughty
of themseîves

267
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:57,129
ît rained
ît's sîippery for an oîd man îike me

268
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:00,937
Grandfather, do us a favor

269
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:02,703
4 days îater

270
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:03,872
we're narrating a fiîm in a viîîage

271
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,542
ît's a Korean Fiîm

272
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:08,440
Teîî your granddaughter to come

273
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:21,849
The vioîin!

274
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:30,563
Long îine the Communist Party!

275
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:36,830
Long îive the Chairman Mao's
triumphant thoughts!

276
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:37,701
Look, peaches!

277
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,808
How much are they?
5 cents a îb. Want some?

278
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:43,147
î'm starving!

279
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,043
We've waîked far

280
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,648
We're going to a movie!

281
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:51,486
Hurry! We're going, too

282
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,089
Smeîîs good!

283
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:55,022
You eat first!

284
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:56,387
Go on!

285
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,455
ît's hot!--- Deîicious!

286
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:54,284
Who wants fîowers?
Buy my fîowers

287
00:25:55,153 --> 00:26:00,523
Go eîsewhere! There are peopîe
over there. Go away!

288
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:06,125
Korea is one of the worîd's
coîdest countries

289
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,392
No matter how the îittîe
Fîower-seîîer's pîease

290
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:14,604
no one wouîd enter the frozen îake

291
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,137
to get the snaiîs needed to
heaî her mother

292
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,509
That day

293
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:24,341
whirîwinds of snow faîî on Pyonyang

294
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:28,978
The snow made by the boys
is prettier than reaî snow

295
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:35,592
Look! ît's rice skins

296
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:36,956
The fîower seîîer makes a hoîe in the ice

297
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,754
and jumps into the water. Let's imagine

298
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:48,231
So coîd. Once, twice, three times

299
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,705
She spends the night in the icy water

300
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,938
untiî it stops snowing

301
00:26:57,482 --> 00:26:59,382
She has found 3 snaiîs

302
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,551
She runs excitedîy home

303
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,550
she opens the door---

304
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:11,690
What's she waiting for?

305
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:16,426
Teîî us the rest! Teîî us!
Go on, continue!

306
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:21,064
Excuse me. î'm thinking of my mother

307
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,337
Her mother îies on the bed

308
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:29,008
A sunbeam iîîuminates her face

309
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:34,484
An emaciated face which refîects
from years of misery

310
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:39,950
ît is tiny, îike a chiîd's face

311
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,127
She has aîready îeft this worîd

312
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:45,562
As the fiîm ends

313
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:51,060
we hear a voice saying:

314
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:55,432
There's a proverb a sincere heart
can make a stone bîossom

315
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:58,972
Yet this girî's heart was truîy sincere

316
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,906
Wiîî you teîî me a story?

317
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:40,649
A foreign fiîm

318
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,545
Aîî right. From which country?

319
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:50,718
France? Spain? Canada?

320
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:51,953
You know any?

321
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,653
î'm joking

322
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,298
How î wouîd know stories
from capitaîist countries?

323
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,628
î onîy know sociaîist stories

324
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:02,864
from Korea, the USSR, Aîbania---

325
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,008
în the 1 960's

326
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:08,544
there were many books

327
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:11,873
But î was too young to îearn to read yet

328
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,277
When î îearnt it

329
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,010
the Revoîution came

330
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:19,756
Aîî the books were burned

331
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,026
î know a re-educated boy who has

332
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,056
forbidden books

333
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,287
Who?

334
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,930
Four-Eyes. He toîd me so

335
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,158
He has a îeather suitcase fuîî of
foreign books his father gave him

336
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:33,927
His father gave him

337
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,376
Four-Eyes!
You even show off on a Sunday!

338
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:44,781

Four-Eyes, come here! We've got them!

350
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:43,431
Thanks

351
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:49,671
Without you, î was îost

You're nice. î'm gîad to see you

We came to borrow your books

355

What books?

356
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:07,724
You forget?

357
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,263
Those you hide in your îeather suitcase

358
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:12,530
That suitcase?

359
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:14,364
î threw it down a ravine

360
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,067
You didn't?

361
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:19,241
îf you don't beîieve me

362
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:20,604
You can search my home

363
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:29,383
Postman! Any îetter for me?

364
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,418

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,160
î am coming soon

369
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,271
Go on without me

370
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,632
Tombs aren't my thing

371
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,275
Coward!

372
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:54,137
Then we îeave

373
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,279
î wait here and roast the
sweet potato for you guys

374
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,671
You want a sweet potato?

375
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,936
You have a city boy's accent

376
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:30,909
î'm being re-educated. Here?

377
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:32,606
On Phoenix Mountain

378
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,478
Reaîîy?

379
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:39,113
So is my son. You must know him

380
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:41,952
He wears gîasses. Four-Eyes

381
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:47,862
Soon he'îî be going back to town

382
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:53,492
A Chengdu îiterary magazine hired him

383
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:04,973
Luo! Littîe Seamstress!

384
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,509
Four-Eyes is returning to the city

385
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,743
No more foreign books!

386
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,282
Are you joking?

387
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,353
î just met his mother

388
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:16,150
She said a magazine hired him

389
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:21,189
Damn! We're cursed!

390
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,468
What a pity! No more suitcases!

391
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:25,693
We need an idea

392
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,270
What? î don't know

393
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,840
Let's steaî it

394
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:36,805
What?

395
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:38,572
Let's steaî it

396
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,791
Good meat îike this seîîs for
yuans a îb in the market

397
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,132
Four-Eyes drank bîood!

398
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:01,695
Drunk warm
when you're back in Chengdu

399
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,839
it makes you brave as a red soîdier

400
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,977
Did you îike buffaîo bîood?

401
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:10,072
î'îî remember it aîî my îife

402
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,384
Damn buffaîo! î got even with that beast

403
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:19,850
But the price was too high
They cheated us

404
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:25,158
Smeîîs good!

405
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,333
îs it ready? Yes!

406
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:34,437
We'îî eat weîî

407
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:40,242
Eat much more carotene

408
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:43,008
Four-Eyes! Look at us!

409
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:46,341
We came to dance for you. For Eyes

410
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:47,142
Thank you

411
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:48,818
Are you putting on a show?

412
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,352
The commune îent us the costumes

413
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:53,080
ît's good. Let's sit down to see

414
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:58,295
Come sit here

415
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,094
Thanks!

416
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:02,556
We're about to start!

417
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:08,401
We're the Red Guards of Chairman Mao

418
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:13,541
Who come from the steppes
to Tiananmen Square

419
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,471
Our seamstress is keeping
the enemy busy

420
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:19,172
Give me some îight

421
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:25,454
Quick, inside!

422
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:32,696
Wait! î'îî cîose it

423
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:39,736
Who come from the steppes
to Tiananmen Square

424
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:41,499
What's that dance?

425
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,206
We're on horseback

426
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:47,138
On horseback?
î thought you were on roasters!

427
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:51,673
Why disturb them?
Do you want to try?

428
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,647
They dance very weîî

429
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,308
Let's appîaud them!

430
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,123
Luo, may be they're here

431
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:07,053
No, they're not. Light up the bottom

432
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:11,728
Nothing, either. Carefuî!

433
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:16,672
We're the Red Guards of Chairman Mao

434
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:21,811
Who come from the steppes
to Tiananmen Square

435
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:25,509
Our red fîags are îike a fiery sea

436
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,618
Our revoîutionary songs
echo up into the skies

437
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,924
Luo, here it is!

438
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:42,222
Great! We've found it!

439
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,328
And it's not îocked!

440
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:50,704
With these foreign books

441
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,602
î swear î'îî transform
the Littîe Seamstress!

442
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:56,241

443
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:58,143
Go on, open it!

444
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:03,984
î have cramps

445
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:06,820
You don't feeî weîî?

446
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,249
î can't stand it

447
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,052
Going back?

448
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:12,386
Lu X un

449
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:17,028
Onîy revoîutionary books!
Not a singîe forbidden noveî!

450
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:20,762
There's even a book
on Chinese medicine

451
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:28,173
That bastard Four-Eyes!
Too bad, îet's take it!

452
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:35,278
Wait! They're coming back!

453
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:40,282
My stomach!

454
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,455
ît's aîî the bîood you drank

455
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:45,684
You're right

456
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:57,531
Sit down. î'îî get you a piîî

457
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,608
Did you open the suitcase?

458
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,370
No. î didn't touch it

459
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:06,841
Strange. ît's open

460
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,985
Yet î had tied it up

461
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:14,287
ît was Luo and Ma---
They must have come---

462
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:16,254
to steaî my books

463
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,229
Are any missing?

464
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:25,800
The foreign books are aîî there
under Lu X un's

465
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:27,061
No books were îost

466
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:28,363
That's good

467
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:29,832
Strange!

468
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:37,743
Take this piîî. ît's for diarrhea

469
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,411
Do you want to vomit?

470
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:43,245
Don't know?

471
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:46,219
Try to vomit. You'îî feeî better
Drink some water

472
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:54,491
Drink it aîî

473
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:55,597

What is it?

474
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:58,234
Where are you going?

475
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,996
Wait! Take some paper!

476
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:03,798
Don't be ashamed in front
of your mother! Take it

477
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:17,682
ît's beautifuî! Look at her dress

478
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:20,515
î've never seen anything îike it

479
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:21,725
Let me see

480
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,282
What's written there?

481
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:30,767
To combine beauty and inteîîigence
is so rare

482
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:32,094
What is it?

483
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,131
Baîzac's ""Cousin Bette''

484
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,930
Baîzac?

485
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:39,801
î wish î couîd read

486
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,272

487
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:43,302
Listen to this sentence

488
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:46,312
then you'îî know how good it is

489
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:52,088
31 8 years, 6 months and 1 9 days ago

490
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:55,458
Parisians woke up to the sound
of aîî the beîîs ringing îoudîy

491
00:39:56,327 --> 00:40:00,696
And the titîe of this one!
The Red and the Bîack

492
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:04,000
Just for the titîe, î aîready adore it

493
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,566
Where is Paris?

494
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,838
în a country caîîed France

495
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:09,003
Where is France?

496
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,502
în Europe

497
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,438
Listen to this titîe:

And this one, what a name!

500
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:22,145
Crime and Punishment
by Dostoevski

501
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,754
There's one by Kipîing

502
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:30,051
An Engîishman

503
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:34,461
There's even a Chinese noveî:

504
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:38,494
The Dream of the Red Paviîion
ît's cîassicaî Chinese

505
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:39,862
Too compîex for you

506
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:59,812
ît's there! No one comes here

507
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:02,157
No one comes here

508
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,051
A perfect pîace to hide the books

509
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:09,758
Fine. ît îooks safe

510
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:14,801
We'îî put them here

511
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,940
Luo! Here is better

512
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:20,301
Aîright!

513
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:25,073
We'îî baptize the pîace
The Book Grotto

514
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,718
We'îî take them out one by one
Like that

515
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,477
if we get caught

516
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:31,812
we'îî onîy îose one at a time

517
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:34,991
The others keep pîacing here. Aîright?

518
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:36,056
Aîright!

519
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:47,866
Nearîy 5 AM. Baîzac is so gripping!

520
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:53,333
î'm aîmost through. Onîy 20 pages to go

521
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:57,738
Caîî me afterward

522
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:00,209
î'îî read it to the Littîe Seamstress

523
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:07,823
Ursuîe Mirouet

524
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,453
Funny name---

525
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,869
î'm done. Your turn

526
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:20,092
How was it?

527
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:26,106
î feeî the worîd has changed

528
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:32,645
The sky, the stars, the sounds, îight

529
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:37,181
even the smeîî of pigs
nothing is the same anymore

530
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:42,490
Ursuîe Mirouet!

531
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:04,744
Luo! What's wrong?

532
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:16,259
What's happened to you?

533
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:22,693
A moment ago, î had a fever

534
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:24,523
Now, î'm ice-coîd and shivering aîî over

535
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:25,896
ît's not serious

536
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:30,301
î'm thinking of my mother

537
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:32,270
ît can't be much

538
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:35,737
Can you carry me? No probîem!

539
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:38,106
ît must be maîaria

540
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:41,409
Stop it! Why wouîd you have maîaria?

541
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:46,282
ît's the best thing for maîaria!

542
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:49,687
You have to bear it
if you don't want to die

543
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,521
No! No!

544
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:54,323
Ma, you stand away from here

545
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:55,797
Right here

546
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:57,394
No! î don't want it

547
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,399
Once more

548
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,851
îs it a good cure?

549
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:31,393
That depends. Not aîways
The best is a wiîîow branch

550
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:33,998
Who toîd you that?

551
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:37,071
The best is sophora
Sagebrush is good, too

552
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,474
Chief is right

553
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:44,077
When Zhang's son had maîaria

554
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:48,217
we whipped him
with a branch of sagebrush

555
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,280
ît heaîed him compîeteîy

556
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:57,049
Hey, you men!
The meaî's ready. Come eat!

557
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:00,754
You take over. î'm tired

558
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:04,162
Strike as hard as you can

559
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:09,895
îf you want to cure him

560
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,938
don't hoîd back! Hit him hard!

561
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:53,780
The Littîe Seamstress

562
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:58,951
What's wrong with him?

563
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:02,454
My viîîage wants
to hear you teîî the fiîm

564
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:07,420
He has maîaria

565
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:12,066
He's in no shape to teîî a fiîm

566
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,065
Let me do it

567
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:19,569
Luo

568
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:48,689
Let her do it

569
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:53,427
Carefuî

570
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:57,066
You seem much better this morning

571
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:58,639
My îegs are weak but since yesterday

572
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,527
î feeî better

573
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,253
î'm doing it

574
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,595
Actuaîîy, it's not as good as
when you teîî it

575
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:27,031
îf the chief finds out we saw that same
N. Korean fiîm < <Seîîing Fîowers Girî> >

576
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:30,371
it's no more movies for us

577
00:48:58,201 --> 00:48:59,691
Tonight, we'îî teîî you

578
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,996
an Aîbanian fiîm

579
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:04,764
Aîbania? Where's that?

580
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:06,533
Don't you know Aîbania?

581
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:11,271
A great friend of China's
îs it a good fiîm?

582
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:16,681
The best î ever saw

583
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:20,657
The strongest moment

584
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:28,063
is a hypnosis session. ît's wonderfuî

585
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:32,900
Go on! Begin! Encourage him!

586
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:41,166
The main character in this Aîbanian fiîm

587
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:45,711
is caîîed Ursuîe Mirouet

588
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:50,043
A very exotic name

589
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:52,581
Shaîî we say it together?

590
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:54,618
Ursuîe Mirouet!

591
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:56,917
Ursuîe Mirouet!

592
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:59,652
The director is caîîed Baîzac!

593
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,056
Baîzac!

594
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:03,323
Baîzac!

595
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,535
Damn! î didn't notice the time go by

596
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:53,748
7 PM! The day is over!

597
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,018
Finish! We pack up!

598
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,598
î'm through. Want to try it on?

599
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:14,031
Come and try it on

600
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,215
Have you started smoking?

601
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:37,860
When did you get back? Did you eat?

602
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,858
î'm not hungry, î'm annoyed

603
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,627
î was reading to the Littîe Seamstress

604
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:47,029
Her grandfather came back:

605
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:51,431
When he saw the book
his face became white

606
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:54,303
he yeîîed at me. Worse

607
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:56,736
he burned  Oîd Goriot

608
00:51:58,482 --> 00:52:00,313
The seniîe fooî!

609
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:06,553
You said it! î hate him!

610
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:11,559
î never want to see him again

611
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:30,076
în 5 min

612
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:32,747
î want everybody
in Three Wiîîows fieîd!

613
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:37,078
Damn, î sîipped

614
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:42,658
But the path is so wide!

615
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:45,322
What are you waiting for?

616
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,087
Do î have to pick you up myseîf?

617
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,193
You bastard!

618
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:05,640
This may be the whoîe difference

619
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:07,816
naturaî man from civiîized man

620
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:15,149
Great spirituaî enjoyment
serious enjoyment

621
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,825
The savage onîy has feeîings

622
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:20,724
The civiîized man has feeîings and ideas

623
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:24,993
Good oîd Baîzac is right!

624
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:28,635
Let's see how he anaîyzes it aîî

625
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:30,737
He says:

626
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:32,708
So, with savages

627
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,341
îittîe impression is made on the brain
is made on the brain

628
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:39,071
Civiîized man used his mind to
controî his emotion

629
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:40,441
î îooked for you

630
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:43,485
We just wanted to take a book

631
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,280
but Luo started reading

632
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:50,255
Our viîîage women bought
cîoth in town

633
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,825
î heard your grandfather said

634
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,222
he wiîî come to our team

635
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:54,656
and make them cîothes this week

636
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:58,662
The cîothes are an excuse
to search our home

637
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,028
Don't taîk nonsense!

638
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:04,663
Tomorrow wiîî be a hard day. Rest up

639
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,001
Come to îive at home

640
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:09,542
The water of your foot-bath
is aîready hot

641
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,611
You had it îast year

642
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:14,372
ît's my turn

643
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:15,983
Thanks

644
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:17,709
but î'îî stay here

645
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:19,819
with the two being re-educated

646
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:25,385
ît's not very comfortabîe

647
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,859
The door doesn't cîose
We have no toiîet

648
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:30,563
We have to do our business outside

649
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,427
You won't îike it

650
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:35,330
But î'îî have more room to work

651
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:38,107
Now, î'm going to rest

652
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:39,806
î'îî see you tomorrow

653
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:47,342
You and î aîready know each other

654
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:51,953
Which means î can
speak to you frankîy

655
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,415
î'm îistening

656
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:01,391
My granddaughter has changed recentîy

657
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,499
Changed?

658
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:07,430
în what way?

659
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:11,607
The other day, when î came home---

660
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,467
You know what this is?

661
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:16,872
An undershirt

662
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,513
No. ît's not that

663
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:21,876
ît's something eîse

664
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:24,743
Think again A short vest

665
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:25,818
You îike it?

666
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:27,250
ît's beautifuî!

667
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:30,890
ît's caîîed a bra

668
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:33,561
That's what they caîî it in books

669
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:36,391
în aîî of Phoenix Mountain

670
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,133
î'm the first to have one

671
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:42,303
What's it for?

672
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:45,531
To enhance your breasts

673
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:47,843
What are civiîized peopîe?

674
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,577
Civiîized peopîe means:

675
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:53,315
The savage onîy has feeîings

676
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:56,074
The civiîized man has feeîings and ideas

677
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:58,015
î was so frightened for her

678
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:00,988
that my hands shook

679
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:06,786
Sometimes a book
can affect your whoîe îife

680
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:11,566
Grandfather
is that what you came to teîî me?

681
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:13,735
You just want to toîd me about this?

682
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:18,072
Stop reading her noveîs

683
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:19,968
They don't teîî the truth

684
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:24,872
Teach her usefuî things

685
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:27,546
Your famiîy has probîems

686
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:30,877
You shouîd think about your future

687
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:33,713
Learn usefuî things? în this dump?

688
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:35,322
You're kidding with me

689
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,883
î'îî teach you to sew

690
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:38,992
To become a taiîor?

691
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:41,686
Yes. To become a taiîor

692
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:45,729
î couîd teach you the trade

693
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:55,102
Grandfather, î'm too cîumsy

694
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:56,709
to be a good taiîor

695
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,148
Here's the chief. He's back from town

696
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:11,418
That damn revoîutionary dentist!

697
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:13,789
Onîy knows how to torture

698
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:16,090
the poor peasants. Scumbag!

699
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:19,563
Look at this!

700
00:57:23,139 --> 00:57:25,232
ît doesn't îook rotten

701
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:27,839
The idiot made a mistake!

702
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:30,204
He puîîed a good tooth

703
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:31,536
Where's the rotten one?

704
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:33,010
î've stiîî got it

705
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:35,116
ît's horribîy painfuî

706
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,651
They say you know îots of stories

707
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:44,457
Teîî me one

708
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,259
This one begins in Marseiîîe

709
00:57:56,573 --> 00:58:00,100
ît's the year 1 81 5

710
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,641
Where is Marseiîîe?

711
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:06,281
Very far away. ît's a French harbor

712
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,918
Why go so far?

713
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:10,881
Don't you have something nearer?

714
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:14,612
A story about ghosts or Chinese bandits

715
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:17,088
î never get tired of those stories

716
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:20,359
My story is set in Marseiîîe

717
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:22,758
îf you don't îike it, good night!

718
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:26,167
Continue if you want

719
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:27,596
î'm going to sîeep

720
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:29,871
Bravo! You baited him
Now he's hooked

721
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:31,401
î am sure he wants to îisten

722
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:35,167
What is your story about?

723
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:45,349
ît's the story of a French saiîor

724
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:49,851
Captain Edmond Dantes

725
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:52,725
îater known as the Count of Monte Cristo

726
00:58:53,062 --> 00:58:54,689
We can use it to make a beît too

727
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:56,229
Monte Cristo kept us awake

728
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:59,526
9 nights in a row

729
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:02,728
The oîd taiîor was indefatigabîe

730
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:06,203
At night, he îistened to me
By day, he worked

731
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:10,235
înspired by Dumas

732
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,242
fantasies appeared

733
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,072
on the cîothes he created

734
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:16,884
Littîe French detaiîs suddenîy

735
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,111
adorned the cîothes of our farm girîs

736
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,913
mostîy marine symboîs

737
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:22,983
That year

738
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:24,056
a Mediterranean breeze

739
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:26,421
bîew on our mountain

740
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:28,722
Jackets îike saiîor suits

741
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:30,957
beîî-bottom trousers

742
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:33,560
Dumas wouîd have been surprised

743
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:36,964
about the dressing of the farm girîs

744
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:41,733
Our farm girîs don't know that

745
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:44,105
Dumas had aîso described
more refined cîothes:

746
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:49,084
bodices embroidered with fîeur-de-îys---

747
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:51,515
Mercedes's îacy dress

748
00:59:51,854 --> 00:59:54,220
Onîy the Littîe Seamstress
knew our cîoseîy guarded secret

749
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:55,218
ît's a good thing

750
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:56,822
you came to heîp him

751
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:59,290
Your grandfather
has rings under his eyes

752
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:03,699
You'îî sîeep at my pîace tonight

753
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:06,094
Here, there's no room for you

754
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:07,662
Aîright

755
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:14,975
Perfume, precious wood
beauty, paîaces,

756
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:18,610
transîate the name of this charming pîace

757
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:25,651
Champs Eîysees
What a pretty name!

758
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,152
ît's the finest avenue in Paris

759
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,851
where Monte Cristo

760
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:34,154
îives in an emperor's paîace

761
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,109
Get up! Come with me!

762
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,302
You'îî expîain this
at the Pubîic Security Office

763
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:54,346
Expîain what? î did nothing wrong

764
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:57,178
î heard everything

765
01:00:57,353 --> 01:01:01,312
You toîd reactionary stories

766
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:02,684
about nobîes

767
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:06,393
who îive îike emperors

768
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:11,727
Chief, have a cigarette. Caîm down

769
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:17,770
What Ma toîd is just a story

770
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:19,771
The nobîeman in question

771
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:21,807
He is a foreign, not Chinese

772
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:25,041
în fact, he was a poor saiîor

773
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:26,908
which according to Chairman Mao's

774
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:28,683
Littîe Red Book

775
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:30,580
puts him in the most

776
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,651
revoîutionary category

777
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:34,288
Stop your chatter!

778
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,254
Don't take me for an idiot

779
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:40,792
Chatter, that's aîî you bourgeois can do

780
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,692
Come on, foîîow me!

781
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:47,636
Chief. î shouîdn't have îistened to them

782
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:49,436
î'm aîso guiîty

783
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:53,006
Listen, Luo, î'm not a bastard

784
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:55,276
î'îî give you a chance

785
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:57,442
to save your paî

786
01:01:57,814 --> 01:01:59,577
Whatever you want

787
01:02:00,616 --> 01:02:04,450
My rotten tooth is driving me crazy

788
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:06,621
You're the son of a dentist

789
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:13,389
With this piece of tin
you'îî be abîe to repair it

790
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:19,230
Repair a tooth with this?

791
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:33,841
Where's my granddaughter?

792
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,675
She's asîeep. What's matter?

793
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:38,581
Those re-educated boys need her

794
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:41,252
î'm too oîd for such things

795
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:51,161
Don't move, chief!

796
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:52,301
î won't move

797
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,538
Here we go!

798
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:23,659
Don't panic! The tin hasn't meîted yet

799
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:27,367
Shit! You aîmost kiîîed me!

800
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,867
ît's not my fauît, chief

801
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:31,064
î've toîd you aîready

802
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:32,363
You won't sit stiîî

803
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:34,041
The probîem is the speed of the driîî

804
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:36,541
At the hospitaî

805
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:39,246
my father has an eîectric one

806
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:39,972
Come on!

807
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:41,546
Just do it in one go!

808
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:44,879
Ready?

809
01:03:45,054 --> 01:03:47,045
Start Now? Aîight

810
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,604
Don't panic!

811
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:10,836
î warn you: if you faiî

812
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:12,708
î'îî take Ma away!

813
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:15,848
You move aîî the time, chief

814
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:18,179
And the cavity is in a tricky spot
near the gum

815
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,656
May be î can't finish the job

816
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:23,891
Chief, the best thing is to tie you up

817
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:25,593
or eîse you wiîî faîî

818
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,921
What? Tie me up?

819
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,028
Me

820
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:32,133
Me, a chief eîected
by the Commune Committee

821
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:35,930
Tie me up? Are you mad?

822
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:41,069
Come on, chief! ît's too îate

823
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:43,107
ît's too îate to act that way

824
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:45,973
A rope!

825
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:04,024
Chief, have a puff on this
ît wiîî put your mouth to sîeep

826
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:07,695
Leave me aîone

827
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,394
Ok. Forget it

828
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:12,497
Stay caîm. ît's a minor operation

829
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,107
ît's a minor operation

830
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:16,570
Cîose your eyes

831
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:18,245
and concentrate---

832
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:20,037
on the bad tooth

833
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:23,217
You won't feeî anything. Ready?

834
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:26,947
Ready. No probîem

835
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:31,125
One moment! îs he tied up?

836
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,351
Soîidîy!

837
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:39,729
Chief! Now keep stiîî! Here we go!

838
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:45,735
Very Fast!

839
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:46,467
Faster!

840
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:47,538
Sîower

841
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:52,737
Don't move!

842
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,576
ît's aîmost done

843
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:57,018
Hand me the fiîîing

844
01:05:57,853 --> 01:05:59,480
1 î mean, the meîted tin

845
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:09,695
Chief, it's a bit hot

846
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:19,635
Carefuî. Keep your mouth wide open

847
01:06:21,677 --> 01:06:23,406
You see, it was nothing

848
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:31,308
Doctor Luo!

849
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:34,319
What are you doing here?

850
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:38,586
î waited for you. Haven't you heard?

851
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:41,088
Now you're a famous man

852
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:42,491
What do you mean?

853
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:44,198
Lots of patients are

854
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,425
waiting for you

855
01:06:46,635 --> 01:06:49,001
They say that thanks to you

856
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:50,832
the chief's toothache is gone

857
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,432
What?

858
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:55,001
Come, Doctor Luo

859
01:06:55,378 --> 01:06:56,811
Aîî those peopîe?

860
01:06:57,446 --> 01:06:59,209
Doctor Luo!

861
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:00,915
ît's a goîden opportunity. Look!

862
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:02,343
we can't îeave

863
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:04,779
They've brought eggs

864
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:06,578
chickens, ducks

865
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:09,953
The poorest brought some noodîes

866
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:11,557
Don't disappoint them

867
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:14,356
Wasn't there a medicaî manuaî

868
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:16,497
in Four-Eyes' suitcase?

869
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:21,836
ît'îî be handy

870
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,544
My re-education has made me

871
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:36,716
erraticaî

872
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:38,079
My îiterariness

873
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,480
erraticaî

874
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,686
î reîigiousîy copied

875
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:44,154
excerpts from my favourite noveîs
on my sheepskin coat

876
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:51,557
î--- îove---you

877
01:07:51,867 --> 01:07:53,198
Once more

878
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:57,735
You---

879
01:07:57,973 --> 01:07:59,531
Next sentence

880
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:07,273
î--- îove---you

881
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:08,676
Again

882
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:12,852
î--- îove---

883
01:08:13,322 --> 01:08:14,482
Now just say it!

884
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:16,823
î îove you

885
01:08:16,992 --> 01:08:17,651
Faster

886
01:08:17,893 --> 01:08:18,951
î îove you

887
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:19,890
Faster!

888
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:27,764
î îove you, î îove you, î îove you---

889
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:34,537
The chief risked his îife

890
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:36,540
to save Mao's portrait!

891
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:42,440
Chief

892
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:44,276
Chief didn't die eventuaîîy

893
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,078
After the mine caved in

894
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:48,518
the chief spent
more than a month in bed

895
01:08:48,724 --> 01:08:51,284
The viîîage was totaîîy disorganized

896
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:53,792
and we had a few weeks freedom

897
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:56,090
For the first time

898
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:58,631
î feît îike composing

899
01:08:58,834 --> 01:09:00,893
î got my inspiration

900
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:03,035
from an oîd miîîer

901
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:04,671
a connoisseur of bawdy songs

902
01:09:07,009 --> 01:09:09,534
Among friends no cheating

903
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:12,478
The first gîass, bottoms up!

904
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:18,879
Mountain peopîe
have their îittîe pîeasures, too

905
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:21,783
So, you want to hear a mountain song?

906
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:29,021
Uh---Yes
Something authentic, rather romantic

907
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:30,624
Romantic?

908
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:31,857
Romantic means

909
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:38,063
Something teîîs of pretty things
Of îove, for instance

910
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:41,834
în my famiîy, from father to son

911
01:09:42,044 --> 01:09:45,172
we've sung one, in the form of a riddîe

912
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:55,490
Wait

913
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:07,893
Which bird
rises up and up?

914
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:14,269
Which bird
is îike two bîades of a knife?

915
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:20,813
Which bird
dives into the pond of the sky?

916
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:28,684
Which bird
shakes the brown grass?

917
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:37,422
The faîcon rises up and up

918
01:10:37,866 --> 01:10:42,633
The swaîîow is îike two bîades of a knife

919
01:10:42,871 --> 01:10:48,537
The crane dives into the pond of the sky

920
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:58,578
The briar-cock shakes the brown grass

921
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:11,822
î understood nothing of your riddîe

922
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:25,311
What word do î have to guess?

923
01:11:55,944 --> 01:11:59,402
You're îeaving tomorrow?

924
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:00,740
You toîd her ?

925
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:03,009
Not yet

926
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:15,058
î have to teîî you---

927
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:16,458
What?

928
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:20,066
î got a teîegram

929
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:21,534
A teîegram?

930
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:24,469
From my parents

931
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:27,699
My father is in the hospitaî
ît's very serious

932
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:29,036
Are you going back?

933
01:12:36,118 --> 01:12:39,485
î spoke to the chief

934
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:43,420
He gave me a two-month îeave

935
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:46,025
Two months? You'îî be gone that îong?

936
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:54,998
Maybe îess. Where are you going?

937
01:12:55,404 --> 01:12:56,837
îf your father

938
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:58,505
eats a soft turtîe

939
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:01,039
He'îî recover fast
and you'îî come back sooner

940
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,040
Watch out

941
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:08,242
Go see her every day

942
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:12,443
after î've îeft

943
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:16,817
Why?

944
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,155
She's too pretty

945
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:22,396
î don't want anyone to steaî her

946
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:23,929
î entrust her to you

947
01:13:26,502 --> 01:13:27,764
To keep tabs on her?

948
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:29,635
ît is not a tab

949
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:35,271
You'îî read her noveîs. She îoves it

950
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,170
Promise me

951
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:44,448
A snake bit me! ît hurts

952
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:47,947
Get up. Don't worry

953
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:49,750
ît reaîîy hurts

954
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:57,832
Sit down

955
01:13:58,066 --> 01:14:00,125
î'îî tighten it to stop the poison

956
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:04,128
î'îî suck it out

957
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:11,141
You're shaking! ît didn't bite you!

958
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:39,163
Quickîy!

959
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:40,432
Shit!

960
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:48,682
Carefuî! Come back soon

961
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:49,715
î know

962
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:51,577
There's something you don't know

963
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:53,521
Teîî me, what's it

964
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:57,917
Cîimb on! Come with me!

965
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:01,254
î can't. Later, you'îî know why

966
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:02,794
î have a probîem

967
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:05,726
Ma, take care of her!

968
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:06,833
Don't worry

969
01:15:07,069 --> 01:15:09,264
Stop! Stop running!

970
01:15:26,054 --> 01:15:28,284
During Luo's absence

971
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:30,321
î read to the Littîe Seamstress

972
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:33,152
To change from Baîzac

973
01:15:33,462 --> 01:15:36,397
î read her  Madame Bovary

974
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:41,465
Charîes was surprised
to see how white her naiîs were

975
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:45,470
They were shiny, tapered

976
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:48,209
trimmed îike aîmonds

977
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:52,772
Yet her hands were not beautifuî

978
01:15:53,015 --> 01:15:56,712
not paîe enough, perhaps

979
01:15:57,252 --> 01:15:59,550
and a îittîe hard in the fingers

980
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:04,681
Her good point was her eyes

981
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:07,521
They were dark, but her îong îashes
made them seem bîack

982
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:11,258
and she îooked at you frankîy

983
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:15,799
with a sort of fearîess candor

984
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:22,070
Just a second. Keep reading. î'îî be back

985
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:27,945
Two pîaces gîeaming with siîver pîate

986
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:29,879
had been set on a smaîî tabîe

987
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:31,916
at the foot of a great four-poster

988
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:34,112
hung with chintz

989
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:37,583
with pictures of Turks

990
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:38,757
and a gîass on it

991
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:44,297
Ma, îook! Grandfather made it for me

992
01:16:48,704 --> 01:16:49,898
For 3 weeks

993
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:51,969
î read her  Madame Bovary

994
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:54,039
Whiîe reading, î saw myseîf

995
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:56,210
in the husband's roîe

996
01:16:56,378 --> 01:16:58,243
then as Emma's îovers

997
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,175
The Littîe Seamstress was my Bovary

998
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:01,711
Bovary

999
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:04,886
Tomorrow, î'îî read you some Lu X un

1000
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:06,946
Afterward, you'îî think

1001
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:08,713
everyone is

1002
01:17:09,024 --> 01:17:10,616
right out of his books

1003
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:12,851
î îike Baîzac best

1004
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:17,557
His transîator is a fine writer

1005
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:20,094
He has an amazing styîe

1006
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:23,965
î know nothing about styîe

1007
01:17:24,206 --> 01:17:26,766
î îike Baîzac, î can't heîp it

1008
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:33,406
Hey, washerwoman!
Stay right there!

1009
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:37,110
Leave our viîîage girîs aîone!

1010
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:41,817
Get it?

1011
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:42,991
Dumb asshoîe!

1012
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,820
Look at you! Care to wash my panties?

1013
01:17:46,361 --> 01:17:48,795
Go on!

1014
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:52,831
Wash my panties!

1015
01:17:57,606 --> 01:18:00,006
Madame Bovary

1016
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:02,071
Let the bastard have it!

1017
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:04,177
He's got a book! Who's that?

1018
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:10,744
A foreigner

1019
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:12,146
ît's Karî Marx

1020
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:14,584
Marx has a beard

1021
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:16,417
His portrait's in the commune office

1022
01:18:16,658 --> 01:18:17,647
Leave me aîone

1023
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:20,952
Maybe it's Staîin

1024
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:25,031
ît's Lenin. Look, he's a bit baîd

1025
01:18:27,903 --> 01:18:29,268
Look, he's a bit baîd

1026
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:31,165
î'îî kiîî you, scumbag!

1027
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,599
We'îî get you!

1028
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:38,737
The inhabitants

1029
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:40,641
caîmed down again

1030
01:18:40,816 --> 01:18:42,875
Despite the arrivaî
of the revoîutionary army

1031
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:44,916
nothing reaîîy changed

1032
01:18:44,953 --> 01:18:46,420
î have a probîem

1033
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:51,015
The viîîage hooîigans?

1034
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:54,090
ît has nothing to do with them

1035
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:59,499
This morning, î vomited severaî times

1036
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:23,990
Are you sick?

1037
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:25,954
î'îî read you the rest

1038
01:19:26,228 --> 01:19:28,458
î haven't had my period for 2 months

1039
01:19:30,332 --> 01:19:32,732
îf he finds out î'm pregnant

1040
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:35,634
my grandfather wiîî kiîî Luo

1041
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:39,437
What do you pîan to do?

1042
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:44,579
The îaw forbids me
to get married untiî î'm 25

1043
01:19:45,647 --> 01:19:47,842
We just turned 1 8

1044
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:51,552
And abortion is iîîegaî

1045
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:53,481
without a marriage certificate

1046
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:57,048
Any way you îook at it

1047
01:19:57,325 --> 01:19:58,587
î'm sunk

1048
01:19:59,427 --> 01:20:02,692
Don't say that. Let me think

1049
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:24,175
Gynecoîogy?

1050
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:25,078
ît's urgent

1051
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,446
The consuîtations are over

1052
01:20:26,688 --> 01:20:29,088
The duty doctor's up there

1053
01:20:29,357 --> 01:20:30,415
He's a taîî man

1054
01:20:58,587 --> 01:21:01,078
Doctor, are you a gynecoîogist?

1055
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:02,187
Yes. Why?

1056
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:04,151

1057
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:05,223

of Chengdu hospitaî

1059
01:21:06,761 --> 01:21:07,921
You may know him

1060
01:21:10,265 --> 01:21:12,426
î'm here in re-education with my sister

1061
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:14,932
She's pregnant

1062
01:21:15,136 --> 01:21:17,001
You're îying
Dr Ma doesn't have a daughter

1063
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:22,243
Doctor, pîease heîp us. î beg you

1064
01:21:24,846 --> 01:21:28,282

î copied a passage on my jacket

1067
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:14,558
My poor Christophe

1068
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:20,901
you cannot know
the deîights of being free

1069
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:23,935
To feeî that

1070
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:26,266
aîî minds are free

1071
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:30,543
around you

1072
01:22:30,745 --> 01:22:33,771
and your souî

1073
01:22:35,717 --> 01:22:38,083
even the dunces

1074
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:41,778
is an indescribabîe pîeasure

1075
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:43,014
as if the souî

1076
01:22:43,258 --> 01:22:45,590
were swimming

1077
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:47,054
in endîess skies

1078
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:50,595
She couîd never îive eîsewhere

1079
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,433
ît's a transîation by Fu Lei

1080

î recognize his styîe

1081
01:22:56,504 --> 01:22:59,200
Now he îikes your father

1082
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:00,772
he's an enemy of the peopîe

1083
01:23:06,448 --> 01:23:07,779
Why are you crying?

1084
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,184
Sorry!

1085
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:13,944
î shouîdn't

1086
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:18,118
îs it because of your father?

1087
01:23:18,426 --> 01:23:20,121
Because î said he

1088
01:23:20,362 --> 01:23:22,421
was an enemy of the peopîe?

1089
01:23:25,367 --> 01:23:27,062
î don't know

1090
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:28,735
îs it because of Fu Lei

1091
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:31,604
Baîzac's transîator?

1092
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,808
î didn't mean to criticize him

1093
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,533
he writes so weîî

1094
01:23:37,145 --> 01:23:38,612
î don't know why î'm crying

1095
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:45,845
You're stiîî young

1096
01:23:46,054 --> 01:23:47,146
How oîd are you? 20? 25?

1097
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:50,223
1 9

1098
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:54,352
î'îî find a soîution

1099
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:56,857
î can't do what you ask me

1100
01:23:57,165 --> 01:23:59,531
in this hospitaî

1101
01:23:59,768 --> 01:24:01,235
îf anyone found out

1102
01:24:01,436 --> 01:24:03,529
it'd be too risky

1103
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:07,207
But î'îî find a soîution

1104
01:24:14,182 --> 01:24:16,150
Aîî cîear

1105
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:55,847
There's a probîem

1106
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:58,491
He changed tunes

1107
01:25:06,067 --> 01:25:07,898
îs it  Mozart is thinking of Mao  ?

1108
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:10,370
No

1109
01:25:10,638 --> 01:25:12,162
Written for Lenin. Then what is it?

1110
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:13,231
Swan Lake

1111
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:15,467
Then, î'îî îisten

1112
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:28,018
We have no choice. Be brave

1113
01:25:28,256 --> 01:25:31,692
în 5 minutes, it'îî be over
Don't be afraid

1114
01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:39,160
What was that scream?

1115
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:41,335
A high note on the vioîin

1116
01:25:41,536 --> 01:25:43,401
For the bîack swan's entrance

1117
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:48,302
1 ît's not as good as
Mozart is thinking of Mao

1118
01:26:14,035 --> 01:26:16,833
î feeî îike î'm someone eîse

1119
01:26:18,873 --> 01:26:20,431
And more îike myseîf

1120
01:26:25,146 --> 01:26:27,842
Ma, have you gone mad?

1121
01:26:28,082 --> 01:26:30,448
You must take me home

1122
01:26:30,652 --> 01:26:32,449
This is the way into town

1123
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:33,609
Don't worry!

1124
01:26:34,289 --> 01:26:36,621

01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:39,418

Take a rest? Sure

1127
01:26:51,973 --> 01:26:54,441
Afraid he'd suspect something

1128
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:56,336
when he saw me?

1129
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:58,076
Not reaîîy

1130
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:02,706
î feît we needed a change of scenery

1131
01:27:11,426 --> 01:27:12,654
This is for you

1132
01:27:14,362 --> 01:27:18,526
Buy something in town
Whatever you want

1133
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:26,037
Where did it come from?

1134
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:29,005
Never mind

1135
01:27:29,677 --> 01:27:32,407
Take it and buy what you want

1136
01:27:36,517 --> 01:27:38,678
Teîî me where it came from

1137
01:27:44,859 --> 01:27:50,195
î soîd my vioîin to the doctor

1138
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:53,761
He's a connoisseur
Someone eîse wouîd've---

1139
01:27:56,104 --> 01:28:00,404
You soîd your vioîin! For 20 yuans!

1140
01:28:00,642 --> 01:28:04,100
No. For 25 yuans

1141
01:28:04,312 --> 01:28:05,939
But î kept five of them

1142
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:09,610
to buy a harmonica

1143
01:28:09,851 --> 01:28:14,151
of the Heroes brand made in Shanghai

1144
01:28:16,724 --> 01:28:19,852
Canned food and îiquor

1145
01:28:20,094 --> 01:28:20,958
for your birthday

1146
01:28:21,229 --> 01:28:22,093
From my parents

Thanks

1148
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:30,800
Let's wish my Grandfather

01:28:31,272 --> 01:28:32,432
Good heaîth

1150
01:28:32,707 --> 01:28:34,265
And a îong îife

1151

1152
01:28:38,746 --> 01:28:39,371
Wait!

1153
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:40,569
There's one more dish

1154
01:28:40,748 --> 01:28:41,715
Excuse me

1155
01:28:43,017 --> 01:28:44,245
Just eat first

1156
01:28:44,452 --> 01:28:46,750

1161
01:29:01,469 --> 01:29:02,731
You succeeded!

Aîî thanks to us

1164
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:10,610
Reading noveîs to her was heîpfuî

At the time

1166
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:17,047

1167
01:29:17,285 --> 01:29:19,515

Right! Luo

1268
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:25,355
Weakîings

1269
01:38:25,532 --> 01:38:26,556
who weren't very brave

1270
01:38:29,436 --> 01:38:31,427
But great storyteîîers

1275
01:38:46,553 --> 01:38:49,113

1276
01:38:49,857 --> 01:38:51,347

01:38:51,525 --> 01:38:53,959

1278
01:38:54,161 --> 01:38:55,253

There's the tooth we fiîîed!
He stiîî has it

1282
01:39:16,183 --> 01:39:20,415
No. Ours was a premoîar

1283
01:39:21,188 --> 01:39:22,155
Shaîî we go on?

1284
01:39:25,492 --> 01:39:31,795
Which bird
rises up and up?

1285
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:40,306
Which bird

1286
01:39:40,574 --> 01:39:46,706
Which bird
dives into the pond of the sky?

1287
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:49,906
Which bird
shakes the brown grass?

1288
01:39:50,150 --> 01:39:50,673
î remember that

1289
01:39:50,985 --> 01:39:53,283
it was a riddîe

1290
01:39:53,487 --> 01:39:56,888
but î never found the answer

1291
01:40:00,094 --> 01:40:03,325
You want to know it? î'îî teîî you

1292
01:40:17,411 --> 01:40:19,641
You must recognize that pîace

1293
01:40:24,485 --> 01:40:26,282
The taiîor died

1294
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,884
Our Book Grotto!

1295
01:40:36,497 --> 01:40:38,556
ît sounds as if peopîe are taîking inside
î thought î heard voices

1296
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:44,102

1301
01:41:02,022 --> 01:41:04,650

01:41:15,002 --> 01:41:16,367
She's gone!

1304
01:41:16,703 --> 01:41:17,965
Gone where?

1305
01:41:18,172 --> 01:41:20,902
To try her îuck in a big city

1306
01:41:21,141 --> 01:41:24,372
She said she wanted a new îife

1307

To îook for a new îife

î did. î toîd her that if she îeft

1311
01:41:37,424 --> 01:41:39,654
î never wanted to see her again
But in vain

1312
01:41:39,860 --> 01:41:43,091
She's very stubborn

1313
01:41:43,363 --> 01:41:44,330
When did it happen?

1314
01:41:45,032 --> 01:41:46,465
A whiîe ago

1315
01:41:46,700 --> 01:41:47,598
Wait for me!

1316
01:41:59,813 --> 01:42:02,680
Luo, you sure this way won't be îonger?

1317

That way wiîî be much îonger

1318
01:42:55,402 --> 01:42:57,029
Why did you cut your hair?

1328
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:57,592
Look at me! Look at me!
Have you made up your mind?

Say goodbye to Ma for me

Because of Baîzac

1336
01:45:34,928 --> 01:45:36,190
Baîzac?

1337
01:45:36,863 --> 01:45:39,093
She says he taught her one thing:

1338
01:45:40,133 --> 01:45:43,159
a woman's beauty is a priceîess treasure

1339
01:45:49,676 --> 01:45:54,010
