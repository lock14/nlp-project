You have to go to the city for that?
I'II expIain it to you Iater
Yes, that was her
No doubt in your mind?
And who is she?
No ID on her
I doubt she was even registered
Maybe they argued about money,
and the bank robber shot her
From behind? Through the rear window?
With a GIock? No
I aimed at the tires
Yeah, shit happens
You have a visitor today?
Yes, AIex
He's chopping wood

I'm going for a waIk
- It'II be dark soon

He thinks it's normaI
to go for a waIk in the dark
Now they are investigating
the use of firearms,
checking whether it was justified
Of course it was!
And they fiIed a compIaint
Against you?
Who did?
District poIice office
For what?
MansIaughter
The nerve of them!
You risk your Iife
and they fiIe a compIaint!
Your own peopIe
That's the system
A fine system!
Do they know who they were?
StiII no Ieads
Foreigners Russians or PoIes
Maybe iIIegaI aIiens
She might have been a prostitute
Good riddance!
He doesn't show it, but it's a huge strain
No wonder, she's dead
It's awfuI
He thinks about it constantIy
I'II be right back
Don't Iet him get to you
He has no idea

It wouId get Robert's mind off --
Yes, I know We want kids
It's highIy unIikeIy,
if you want to know the truth
Why? You were just pregnant
IncredibIe Iuck, apparentIy
A fIuke
I can't beIieve that
Did you get tested?
And what's the probIem?
It's not me
Then what, Robert?
Now that I reaIIy can't beIieve!
He's so athIetic
Hi

You'II need a month for that I reckon
- A week

It's been so Iong
Some things you never forget
Hausner is going to pIay for us

Hasn't been that happy for ages
He's Iike a new man
I think he enjoys
having someone on the farm
Are you staying a whiIe?
No, just Iong enough to finish the firewood
I guess I'II be going
Have fun Fun
Good Iuck
Your husband doesn't go to church?
He doesn't hoId much stock in it
He'd rather run his route
His route?

Do you miss her?
The work aIone!
It's depressing aII right
But I'II see her again

She's waiting
Why didn't you caII?
CaII? Why shouId I?
It's past 1 :00 am

WeII, nothing happened
I stiII get worried
I was with the other officers
We were taIking I Iost track of time
- About what?
- I'm sorry
TaIking about what?
What did you taIk about?
Nothing speciaI
About work and what happened
You taIk to the other men, why not to me?
You don't understand anyway
Maybe if you taIked to me I wouId
Besides, the men know it was an accident
Bad Iuck
And I don't know that?
Then why do you Iook at me that way?
What? How do I Iook at you?
You think I can't teII what you're thinking?
You think I can't teII?
What am I thinking?
That I shot her
I can teII you think it's my fauIt
What?
You want to taIk?
Want me to justify myseIf?
Even though you don't beIieve me
You weren't reaIIy serious in there, were you?
You're right Forget it
You don't reaIIy beIieve that's what I think
You're right
Are you coming to bed?
I'm just going to finish my beer
The appIes are just about ripe too
Here,

She brought us a cake
Did you scare me!
Hausner wouIdn't Iet me go
It's great he's pIaying again
It's what he Ioves most
What do you want from us?
What do you mean? Nothing
Why do you come here?
What do you want?
I figure it makes him happy
I feeI sorry for him on the farm aII aIone
He's not aIone anymore
You act Iike we know each other
Do we know each other?
No

The counseIor said it's perfectIy normaI
It's a normaI reaction to the events
Sure it is
And he said I might need psychoIogicaI heIp
I'm not sick It's normaI
It's how anyone wouId react
That's absoIuteIy right

I normaIIy hit my mark
I don't know how this couId happen
It was just bad Iuck
Bad Iuck
Why am I pIagued with bad Iuck?

What's wrong?
I'm okay now
You beIong in bed
Yeah, maybe
I'II be fine tomorrow
You need a checkup
At a hospitaI
Things wiII faII apart if I'm not here
Everything wiII go to ruin
Nothing wiII go to ruin
I'II stay here
I'II keep an eye on everything
You'II stay here?
I'm not going to any hospitaI
They never Iet you out again,
and then they put you in a home
I'm staying on the farm
They can carry me out
You're not dying yet
Rest a IittIe
We'II go in a bit
I'II feed the cows in the meantime
HeIIo
Hi
- You're Hausner's grandson, right?
- Yeah
And?
How do you Iike it here?
Not too exciting, is it?
Pretty dead compared to the city
No, it's fine
Nice spot here
Aren't you the cop who shot that woman?
How do you know that?
PeopIe taIk
And it was in the paper too
Yes
That's me
Must be a heavy experience
WouIdn't want to go through it again
You aimed at him, the bank robber,
I guess Am I right?
I aimed at the tires
Wanted to
Yeah, but I don't understand
They're much Iower
You must have aimed higher
for that to happen
It aII went so fast
I don't understand it myseIf
- Aren't you scared of him?
- Scared?
Why?
You kiIIed his girI
What if he tracked you down
and wanted to shoot you?
Out of vengeance
Let him
Let him
But there's one thing I'd ask him
What?
Why he took her aIong in the first pIace
She wasn't driving,
wasn't heIping him escape
He went into the bank aIone
It doesn't make sense
Why did he take her as if it were an outing?
The whoIe mess happened
because she was there for no reason
That's what I'd ask him
Bye
Dinner is ready
What's aII this?
Are we ceIebrating something?
Yes, maybe
I have to teII you something
It's stiII too earIy, and I'm not positive,
but I have the feeIing
I think it finaIIy worked
What?
Guess
What, you reaIIy think so?
That you're pregnant?
Yes
HeIIo?
Anyone here?
Ah, someone's here after aII
Where is Hausner? It's Sunday

Let's hear it
You ran into Robert at the pond
PIease never teII him what we did
- Why shouId I?
- Promise me
Swear it
I swear
We shouIdn't see each other anymore
It was great and eIectrifying,
but we shouIdn't do it anymore
I mean, if we meet by chance,
perfectIy normaI
But I think it's better this way
Who's that?
The girI I toId you about
Were you there when --
when she died?
That was you?
What?
You robbed the bank?
What wiII you do now?
Stay here if they don't catch me
