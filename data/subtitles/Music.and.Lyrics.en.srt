1
00:00:53,556 --> 00:00:57,497
I never thought
That I could be so satisfied

2
00:00:57,665 --> 00:01:01,195
Every time that I look in your angel eyes

3
00:01:01,373 --> 00:01:06,076
A shock inside me
That words just can't describe

4
00:01:06,248 --> 00:01:08,845
And there's no explaining

5
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:12,756
Something in the way you move
I can't deny

6
00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:16,425
Every word from your lips is a lullaby

7
00:01:16,603 --> 00:01:19,199
A twist of fate makes life won'thwhile

8
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,971
You are gold and silver

9
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:26,880
I said I wasrt gonna lose my head

10
00:01:27,057 --> 00:01:31,465
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

11
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,469
I wasrt gonna fall in love again

12
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:38,772
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

13
00:01:38,947 --> 00:01:43,911
And I just can't let you go

14
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:46,926
I can't lose this feeling

15
00:01:47,097 --> 00:01:49,761
These precious moments
We have so few

16
00:01:49,935 --> 00:01:54,536
Let's go far away
Where there's nothing to do but play

17
00:01:54,712 --> 00:01:59,278
You've shown to me
That my destiny's with you

18
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:01,720
And there's no explaining

19
00:02:02,494 --> 00:02:05,056
I said I wasrt gonna lose my head

20
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:09,902
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

21
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:12,707
I wasrt gonna fall in love again

22
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:16,549
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

23
00:02:16,722 --> 00:02:21,927
And I just can't let you go

24
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,231
I can't lose this feeling

25
00:02:37,263 --> 00:02:39,529
A twist of fate makes life won'thwhile

26
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:44,143
You are gold and silver

27
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:47,147
I said I wasrt gonna lose my head

28
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:51,656
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

29
00:02:51,826 --> 00:02:55,287
I wasrt gonna fall in love again

30
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:58,667
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

31
00:02:58,839 --> 00:03:00,069
And I just

32
00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:05,183
Can't let you go

33
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,826
PoP was one of the biggest bands
of the '80s...

34
00:03:09,996 --> 00:03:12,592
...but today they're known
as Colin Thompsors old group.

35
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,763
Colin, or as he's been dubbed
by the queen, "Sir Colin"...

36
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:19,277
...has gone on to sell millions of records,
star in blockbuster films...

37
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,147
...and create his own cologne,
"A Whiff of Colin."

38
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,583
But here's a question:

39
00:03:23,756 --> 00:03:27,127
Can you remember the name
of the other guy in PoP?

40
00:03:27,297 --> 00:03:30,292
Whatever happened to Alex Fletcher?

41
00:03:30,904 --> 00:03:34,900
Tonight we find out
on Battle of the '80s Has-Beens.

42
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:39,620
We think it's gonna be bigger
than American Idol.

43
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:41,257
So, what do you think, Alex?

44
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:42,552
Well, I love it.

45
00:03:42,728 --> 00:03:46,668
It's brilliant on so many levels,
I don't even know where to start.

46
00:03:46,836 --> 00:03:47,825
Good for you.

47
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:50,133
Because some of the people
we've approached...

48
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:54,181
...have had a little problem
with the term "has-been."

49
00:03:54,351 --> 00:03:55,341
Have they? Have they?

50
00:03:55,521 --> 00:03:59,893
You see, I don't share that.
I am a happy has-been. Really.

51
00:04:00,062 --> 00:04:02,294
It's a very clear statement:
"I live in the past.

52
00:04:02,467 --> 00:04:04,369
Everything good I ever did
was long ago.

53
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:06,873
Don't expect anything
new or exciting from me now."

54
00:04:07,043 --> 00:04:09,913
Really takes the pressure off.
Especially on a first date.

55
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:11,448
Good for you.

56
00:04:12,287 --> 00:04:14,655
So we've already taped several shows...

57
00:04:14,824 --> 00:04:17,090
...and we're going to start
airing them this week.

58
00:04:17,262 --> 00:04:19,927
And some of the performers
include REO Speedwagon...

59
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:21,935
- Speedwagon.
...Flock of Seagulls...

60
00:04:22,106 --> 00:04:23,266
The Flock? Okay.

61
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:25,173
...Debbie Gibson, Tiffany...
- Debbie.

62
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,415
- History there.
...and Frankie Goes to Hollywood.

63
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:32,526
So "Relax."

64
00:04:33,062 --> 00:04:34,963
Nice one.

65
00:04:35,131 --> 00:04:37,695
Good. Okay. Worthy adversaries, all.

66
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:40,570
And how many songs
would I actually get to perform?

67
00:04:40,744 --> 00:04:42,372
I'd like to do two, you know?

68
00:04:42,547 --> 00:04:44,779
A ballad and then maybe
a more up-tempo number...

69
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,445
...where I get to shake it a bit.

70
00:04:47,624 --> 00:04:52,191
I can't promise any of the acts
that they'll be singing.

71
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:56,840
Sorry? Confused.
What would we be doing, then?

72
00:04:57,377 --> 00:04:59,005
Boxing.

73
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:04,720
That's why the show is called
Battle of the '80s Has-Beens.

74
00:05:04,892 --> 00:05:08,922
Only the winner gets to sing.

75
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,445
Right, right, right. Got you.

76
00:05:24,497 --> 00:05:26,295
- Afternoon, Mr. Fletcher.
- Hello, Willy.

77
00:05:26,468 --> 00:05:27,458
Have a good day.

78
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:29,573
Yes, well, enjoyed it so far.

79
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:33,370
- All right. There he is.
- Oh, my manager.

80
00:05:33,549 --> 00:05:36,248
All right, listen,
I had no idea they meant boxing.

81
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:38,219
Nobody said a word to me, I swear.

82
00:05:38,391 --> 00:05:41,329
No, it's not a problem.
I can definitely take Flock of Seagulls.

83
00:05:41,498 --> 00:05:45,495
We did a tour with them in '89 and we beat
them severely. They cried like little girls.

84
00:05:45,673 --> 00:05:49,272
All right, listen. It's my fault
and I hate myself for it, but I'm not upset.

85
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:51,109
And do you know why?

86
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,810
You've been at my liquor.

87
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:54,286
Because of her.

88
00:05:55,994 --> 00:05:58,294
Cora Corman.
Biggest star in the world.

89
00:05:58,465 --> 00:06:00,833
Bigger than Britney and Christina
put together.

90
00:06:01,004 --> 00:06:04,272
And guess who she loves.

91
00:06:04,444 --> 00:06:05,537
Her country?

92
00:06:06,415 --> 00:06:11,722
You. She's a huge PoP fan
and she wants to meet you, Alex.

93
00:06:11,892 --> 00:06:13,829
Hang on, hang on.

94
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:16,824
Khan, I've missed you.

95
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:19,030
Alex, I have Sophie here for you.

96
00:06:19,207 --> 00:06:20,800
That sounds like fun. Who is she?

97
00:06:20,976 --> 00:06:23,276
She's here to do your plants.

98
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:24,610
But Jane does my plants.

99
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:28,656
She can be in and out in five minutes,
and this is really the best time for her.

100
00:06:28,827 --> 00:06:31,024
It seems she cannot be stopped.
Send her up.

101
00:06:31,698 --> 00:06:33,827
So start again. Cora Corman...

102
00:06:34,003 --> 00:06:37,032
Why do you have a plant lady?
Why do you even have plants?

103
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,512
Because from time to time...

104
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:41,810
...ladies accompany me
back to the apartment...

105
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,786
...and one once mentioned
that plants make women comfortable.

106
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,794
Is that true?
Plants make women comfortable?

107
00:06:47,964 --> 00:06:50,800
Well, maybe if I had plants
I'd still be married.

108
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,633
Yes, I think that was the problem.

109
00:06:52,808 --> 00:06:54,800
Not Susars affair
and raging nymphomania...

110
00:06:54,978 --> 00:06:56,914
...but your lack of vegetation.

111
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,919
Hang on.

112
00:07:05,132 --> 00:07:07,899
- Hi, I'm Sophie Fisher.
- I'm Alex Fletcher.

113
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:11,270
- You didn't get the message from Jane?
- No. I haven't listened to my...

114
00:07:11,443 --> 00:07:14,007
She was supposed to let you know
I'd be doing plants.

115
00:07:14,551 --> 00:07:16,714
Very nice. Lovely. Well, come on in.

116
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:17,947
Thank you.

117
00:07:18,124 --> 00:07:22,065
I hope you have your own watering can.
Jane told me that everyone had their own.

118
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:26,366
But this last guy, Mr. Werther, about 80,
he didn't have his own watering can...

119
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,512
...so he starts yelling at me
and screaming at me in German:

120
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,120
I'm fluent enough
to know what he's saying.

121
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:36,225
You haven't been cursed at
till you've been cursed at in German.

122
00:07:36,394 --> 00:07:38,556
I know what you mean.
I dated a fraulein once.

123
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,463
Plant stuff is in the kitchen under the sink.
And I have my own can.

124
00:07:43,642 --> 00:07:45,908
Oh, well, vielen Dank.

125
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:49,045
Hi, I'm Chris Riley, Alex's manager.

126
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,192
Oh, Sophie Fisher. Nice to meet you.

127
00:07:53,527 --> 00:07:55,863
So kitchen?

128
00:07:56,034 --> 00:07:58,231
- Yeah.
- Great.

129
00:07:59,473 --> 00:08:02,173
So Cora Corman, huh?
How great is that? Do you believe it?

130
00:08:02,345 --> 00:08:05,876
All right, wait, wait, wait.
Is it even a good idea? Pros and cons.

131
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:10,757
Pros: She's a huge star,
great publicity, terrific money.

132
00:08:11,765 --> 00:08:12,926
Cons?

133
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,731
No matter what you do,
in 40 years we'll both be dead.

134
00:08:15,906 --> 00:08:19,573
Okay. Huge star, great publicity,
terrific money versus eventual death.

135
00:08:19,747 --> 00:08:21,375
I think we have to think about it.

136
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:23,953
Okay, good, because Cora
is shooting a video tonight.

137
00:08:24,122 --> 00:08:26,592
- She wants to meet both of us right after.
- Tonight?

138
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:27,956
- Tonight?
- Yes, tonight.

139
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,694
You all right?

140
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,340
Do you have a Band-Aid
and antibiotic cream?

141
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:39,349
No, no. And sadly,
I think I've lent out my iron lung.

142
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,613
Okay.

143
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:44,160
Well, then I'm gonna go because,
you know, this could get infected.

144
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:48,133
And it's not clotting yet, but, I mean,
I'm a little hypochondriacal.

145
00:08:48,304 --> 00:08:50,935
You just... You can never be too careful.

146
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,308
Anyway, I'll come back and finish.

147
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:56,318
So come again. I mean, you live here.
I'll come again.

148
00:08:56,487 --> 00:08:57,979
I'm gonna go get this looked at.

149
00:08:58,157 --> 00:09:02,030
You should really have a first-aid kit.
Thank you. Have a good night. I'll see you.

150
00:09:04,937 --> 00:09:06,098
Weird.

151
00:09:06,273 --> 00:09:08,904
- Don't give her a key.
- No.

152
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:10,810
So you said something about tonight.

153
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,976
Tonight we meet Cora.

154
00:09:18,565 --> 00:09:20,797
I've got to have my Buddha's delight

155
00:09:20,969 --> 00:09:23,565
Om shanti, shanti

156
00:09:23,742 --> 00:09:25,769
I've got to have my Buddha's delight

157
00:09:25,946 --> 00:09:28,747
Om shanti, shanti

158
00:09:30,188 --> 00:09:31,452
I want a revelation

159
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,257
And sweet salvation

160
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,422
And the eternal fire

161
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:38,901
Show me the eternal fire

162
00:09:40,609 --> 00:09:42,738
Like sitting meditation

163
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:45,512
You give me elevation
Can you take me higher?

164
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:48,122
She seems like a very spiritual kid.

165
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,490
Yeah. It's nice to see
a young woman exploring religion.

166
00:09:58,077 --> 00:10:02,450
I'm not satisfied if I don't get

167
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:05,421
My Buddha's delight

168
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,795
And cut.

169
00:10:12,305 --> 00:10:13,899
Terrific.

170
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:17,538
- Hey, I'm Ray, Cora's manager.
- Chris Riley.

171
00:10:17,715 --> 00:10:19,241
- Nice to meet you.
- Alex Fletcher.

172
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,854
- Great to meet you.
- Hi, Ray...?

173
00:10:21,023 --> 00:10:24,086
Just Ray. Cora's this way, come on.
Follow me.

174
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,472
C, this is Alex Fletcher
and his manager, Chris Riley.

175
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:32,736
- We loved the video. It was unbelievable.
- Yeah.

176
00:10:32,913 --> 00:10:36,352
You know, I wish I brought my daughter.
She worships you.

177
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,652
I'm divorced. But that's another story.

178
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:45,162
Mr. Fletcher, it's a pleasure.

179
00:10:46,741 --> 00:10:51,114
Your song "Dance With Me Tonight" got me
through my parents' divorce when I was 7.

180
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,411
Really? Wow.

181
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:55,558
Yeah, because I recorded that
when I was 9, so... Yeah.

182
00:10:55,726 --> 00:11:00,030
I want my fans to know the same
spiritual uplift that your music gave me.

183
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,571
That would be lovely. I have a few tunes
it would be nice to update.

184
00:11:03,742 --> 00:11:07,340
Oh, I don't live in the past, Mr. Fletcher.
It was so long ago.

185
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:09,485
I want you to write a new song.

186
00:11:10,522 --> 00:11:11,784
- Okay.
- You see...

187
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,928
...I recently broke up with my boyfriend.

188
00:11:14,095 --> 00:11:16,931
We had been together
for almost two months.

189
00:11:17,503 --> 00:11:19,165
It was a terrible experience.

190
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:23,280
But then I read a book by Guru Mathashavi
called A Way Back Into Love.

191
00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:26,282
And that will be the title
of our new song.

192
00:11:26,454 --> 00:11:29,392
And in two weeks when I open my tour
at Madison Square Garden...

193
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,085
...we'll perform it together.

194
00:11:31,263 --> 00:11:32,459
Okay. Here's the snag...

195
00:11:32,632 --> 00:11:34,603
We also wanna put the song
on her new CD...

196
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,537
...which is pretty much finished,
so we need it by Friday.

197
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:40,043
- This Friday?
- Yeah, but don't feel any pressure.

198
00:11:40,214 --> 00:11:43,710
We've got seven other retro artists
working on "Way Back Into Love"...

199
00:11:43,888 --> 00:11:46,051
...so if you blow it, we're covered.

200
00:11:46,226 --> 00:11:49,392
Mr. Fletcher,
don't look at this as a competition.

201
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:52,367
If it's meant to be, it will be.

202
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:54,007
It's destiny.

203
00:11:54,175 --> 00:11:55,200
Yes.

204
00:11:55,377 --> 00:11:56,902
Or not.

205
00:12:02,191 --> 00:12:03,318
Okay.

206
00:12:03,494 --> 00:12:06,763
I can't possibly write a song by Friday.
What could she be thinking of?

207
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,097
All right. Look, look,
can I be honest with you?

208
00:12:09,272 --> 00:12:11,402
You're my manager.
I would have to fire you.

209
00:12:11,577 --> 00:12:13,170
We need this.

210
00:12:13,347 --> 00:12:16,548
Let's not be desperate.
We have the state fairs, Knott's Berry Farm.

211
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:17,710
They've canceled.

212
00:12:20,395 --> 00:12:22,057
Knott's Berry canceled?

213
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,938
Look. We're still on
for the Indiana State Fair, okay?

214
00:12:26,106 --> 00:12:28,942
But Texas and Arkansas dropped us.

215
00:12:29,112 --> 00:12:31,811
- The Apple Picking?
- The Apple Picking Festival is a go...

216
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:35,651
...but Great Adventure only wants
three nights instead of 10. All right?

217
00:12:35,824 --> 00:12:38,853
My God. I had no idea.
Why didn't you tell me these things? Why...?

218
00:12:39,031 --> 00:12:40,899
I'm telling... I'm telling you now.

219
00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:43,973
Alex, it's been 15 years since PoP.

220
00:12:44,142 --> 00:12:46,875
There's new old acts
coming up all the time.

221
00:12:47,048 --> 00:12:50,885
Tears for Fears is going on tour.
There's talk of a Spice Girl reunion.

222
00:12:51,055 --> 00:12:52,855
- That's not my audience.
- Ricky Martin.

223
00:12:53,026 --> 00:12:55,657
I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead.
I'm finished. I'm finished.

224
00:12:55,832 --> 00:12:58,599
- No, you're not dead.
- I'm gonna wind up doing bar mitzvahs.

225
00:12:58,771 --> 00:13:02,609
No, you're not. Thirteen-year-old kids
have no idea who you are.

226
00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:03,974
Well, that's good to know.

227
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:07,177
What about you? You might actually
have to take on another client.

228
00:13:07,355 --> 00:13:11,421
Look, don't worry about me. What we gotta
concentrate on is refreshing your image.

229
00:13:11,597 --> 00:13:14,898
Then we'll get Knott's Berry
and Great Adventure. Who knows?

230
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:18,406
- We might even get Disneyland.
- Don't tease me. I'm very vulnerable.

231
00:13:18,577 --> 00:13:20,911
Tell you something, Alex.
You do a song for Cora...

232
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:24,179
...and there is a spot for you
in the Magic Kingdom, baby.

233
00:13:24,355 --> 00:13:27,657
Writing a song. I thought I was done
with that whole nightmare.

234
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:30,356
Just one song.
That's all we need. One song.

235
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:32,566
But it's so...

236
00:13:33,607 --> 00:13:35,099
...time-consuming, you know?

237
00:13:37,281 --> 00:13:39,251
And I haven't written for 10 years.

238
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:42,858
And I need a lyricist. And it's never worked
with anyone except Colin.

239
00:13:43,026 --> 00:13:45,930
Look, I know it's not easy
to get somebody good this fast...

240
00:13:46,099 --> 00:13:49,162
...but there is this guy.
Supposedly he's very hip, very edgy.

241
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:51,502
He just worked with Avril.

242
00:13:56,886 --> 00:13:59,484
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm just a bit blocked here.

243
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,028
If you don't like the lyrics,
be straight with me.

244
00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:05,059
No, no, no, no.
The lyrics are very, very powerful.

245
00:14:05,472 --> 00:14:09,103
Maybe you want something
more commercial? More PoP-y?

246
00:14:09,912 --> 00:14:12,645
Just hold that thinly veiled insult
for one second.

247
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,856
- Hello.
- Hey.

248
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:23,437
- Khan said I could just come up?
- They were able to save the whole hand.

249
00:14:23,608 --> 00:14:26,671
I know. I made too big a deal out of it.

250
00:14:26,846 --> 00:14:30,114
It's just that I hate infections.
But then again, who likes them?

251
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:33,657
- Maybe the people who make penicillin.
- There's two sides to every story.

252
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:37,631
True. Except for the Nazis. I can't really see
the other side of that argument.

253
00:14:37,803 --> 00:14:39,100
Excuse me?

254
00:14:39,272 --> 00:14:42,209
I'm sorry. I didn't even see you there.
Hi. I'm Sophie Fisher.

255
00:14:42,378 --> 00:14:45,908
Yeah, Sophie, this is Greg Antonsky.
He's a noted lyricist.

256
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:51,690
Really? Well, I don't wanna get in your way.
And I can see that I already have.

257
00:14:51,863 --> 00:14:55,530
So I'm off to the kitchen. Don't tell me.

258
00:14:55,704 --> 00:14:57,229
She's kind of hot.

259
00:14:57,408 --> 00:14:59,935
Good. Yeah. I'm glad you enjoyed her.

260
00:15:00,948 --> 00:15:02,612
She's coming back in here, right?

261
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:06,121
I would imagine so. Unless she goes
directly back to the mother ship.

262
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:08,560
How about:

263
00:15:08,997 --> 00:15:11,868
Give it up, I'm a bad hot witch

264
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,702
I look real good, but I'm a nasty bitch

265
00:15:14,877 --> 00:15:17,939
I can scream and claw
And curdle your blood

266
00:15:18,115 --> 00:15:22,557
But you'll die on your way back into love

267
00:15:23,561 --> 00:15:26,556
No. Start on a minor third. Try that.

268
00:15:26,734 --> 00:15:29,204
Right. So:

269
00:15:29,372 --> 00:15:31,969
Give it up, I'm a bad hot witch

270
00:15:32,144 --> 00:15:33,840
I look real good, but I'm a nasty...

271
00:15:34,014 --> 00:15:35,712
Come on. You're missing the point.

272
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:39,915
From the first line.
"Give it up, I'm a bad hot witch" is okay.

273
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:41,391
But then it should be...

274
00:15:41,563 --> 00:15:45,628
But with some magic, I just might switch

275
00:15:51,114 --> 00:15:52,606
Sorry. What did you say?

276
00:15:54,855 --> 00:15:56,849
I don't remember.

277
00:15:57,293 --> 00:16:01,166
I think it was,
"But with some magic, I just might switch."

278
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:04,034
- That is actually quite intriguing.
- That's not my lyric.

279
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,939
No, I know, but it's a lovely phrase.

280
00:16:06,111 --> 00:16:08,879
Look, if you can't handle anything
except moon and June...

281
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,888
...why don't we just let
plant girl finish the lyrics?

282
00:16:13,058 --> 00:16:14,322
Plant girl.

283
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:17,092
Give it up, I'm a bad hot witch

284
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,499
But with some magic, I just might switch

285
00:16:19,672 --> 00:16:23,476
- Finish it.
- I'm just here to cater to the plants.

286
00:16:23,648 --> 00:16:25,742
And you are doing a fine job,
if I may say so.

287
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,511
Although that one is plastic.

288
00:16:30,126 --> 00:16:31,356
This is a waste of time.

289
00:16:32,766 --> 00:16:35,293
Let's fly my broom to the stars above

290
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,307
And we'll charm our way back into love

291
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:47,790
What's the next line,
"Feelings, nothing more than feelings"?

292
00:16:48,763 --> 00:16:50,426
You people disgust me.

293
00:16:53,774 --> 00:16:57,109
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have gotten involved.
I have no filtering system.

294
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,647
No. That's fine, that's fine.

295
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,220
He had to get back to his job
at Hallmark anyway.

296
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:03,825
Listen, have you ever done any writing?

297
00:17:03,993 --> 00:17:07,193
I mean, everybody's done some writing,
you know? Well, not everybody.

298
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:09,599
Illiteracy is a growing epidemic
in this country.

299
00:17:09,772 --> 00:17:11,298
I write slogans for Weight-Not...

300
00:17:11,476 --> 00:17:14,175
...this weight reduction company
that my sister runs.

301
00:17:14,348 --> 00:17:16,682
Did you ever hear of the band PoP?

302
00:17:16,853 --> 00:17:20,851
Yeah, of course, everybody has.
My sister Rhonda loved them.

303
00:17:21,028 --> 00:17:24,057
They had that ridiculous hair
and those ridiculous outfits and...

304
00:17:24,234 --> 00:17:25,726
Oh, my God, you're one of them.

305
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:29,007
That hair was very much in style then.

306
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:31,147
- I'm very sorry.
- Yeah, that's fine.

307
00:17:31,315 --> 00:17:34,412
But I would love to talk to you
about maybe writing some lyrics.

308
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:35,984
But I don't write lyrics.

309
00:17:36,158 --> 00:17:39,187
Well, we could just kick some ideas around,
repot the ficus.

310
00:17:39,364 --> 00:17:41,665
I don't think so.
I appreciate the offer, though.

311
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:44,501
I have to go babysit for my sister now.
I mean, her kids.

312
00:17:44,675 --> 00:17:48,307
She's 38 now, so... Thank you.

313
00:17:50,822 --> 00:17:52,848
Okay, listen.
Do you know who Cora Corman is?

314
00:17:53,026 --> 00:17:54,654
Oh, yeah. My niece loves her.

315
00:17:54,829 --> 00:17:58,029
Okay, well, I'm writing a song for her,
so if you change your mind...

316
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:02,143
...and the idea of working with me is
of any interest at all, please just call, okay?

317
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:05,750
Or if you just fancy a good laugh,
I am performing at the Hilton tonight.

318
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,287
Well, thank you.
I mean, but I can't, you know. I'm sorry.

319
00:18:09,457 --> 00:18:12,452
"I just can't," she says mysteriously.
But I just can't.

320
00:18:12,631 --> 00:18:15,068
- I'm sorry. Thank you for the offer.
- Yes.

321
00:18:19,812 --> 00:18:21,907
Oh, my God.

322
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:24,680
Go to the next level, weirdo.

323
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:27,223
You have to go to the next level.

324
00:18:27,794 --> 00:18:30,994
It's your parents. Go get into bed.
Get into bed. This is not a drill.

325
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:34,937
- But we haven't even brushed our teeth.
- Get in there. Get in there. Get into bed.

326
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,110
- Hey.
- Hi.

327
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,114
- How was the movie?
- I enjoyed it.

328
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,118
- He fell asleep.
- I enjoy sleeping.

329
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:43,019
- How was dinner?
- Really nice place.

330
00:18:43,191 --> 00:18:46,254
It's really hard to enjoy dinner
when you run a weight-loss center.

331
00:18:46,432 --> 00:18:49,404
- Lf I get fat, there goes my fiscal year.
- Honey, you're not fat.

332
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:52,600
You're not about to open a branch in Boca.
But thank you, sweetie.

333
00:18:52,778 --> 00:18:55,044
- How'd everything go here?
- Oh, yeah. Good. Great.

334
00:18:55,215 --> 00:18:57,652
The kids ate and went to sleep.

335
00:18:59,725 --> 00:19:02,892
Yeah, it... They're really bad children.

336
00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:06,794
Okay, okay. Everybody goes to bed.
I'm sending your father in there.

337
00:19:06,973 --> 00:19:11,176
Whoa, we're so scared.

338
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:13,717
And then I'm coming in.

339
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:17,886
I'll just go check
to make sure they're still breathing.

340
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,759
Hey, wanna do some stress eating?
Just a piece of diet cheesecake.

341
00:19:21,936 --> 00:19:25,204
This thing happened to me today...
I don't know. I'm just gonna go home.

342
00:19:25,376 --> 00:19:26,572
You seem so jumpy tonight.

343
00:19:26,746 --> 00:19:29,217
You know, I feel a little guilty
about something.

344
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:30,545
How unusual for you.

345
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:32,615
Okay, listen. I have to tell you.

346
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:36,822
I met that guy from that band
you used to like. Alex Fletcher from PoP?

347
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:38,058
Oh, my God.

348
00:19:38,236 --> 00:19:41,766
Anyway, I do Jane's plant service.
I'm taking over for her while she's gone.

349
00:19:41,943 --> 00:19:44,470
And anyway, she does his apartment,
so I was there.

350
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:46,173
Actually, it was the second time.

351
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,720
And he invited me
to come see him perform tonight.

352
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,689
Gary, I'm going out!

353
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,994
Oh, my God. I love him. I love him.
I love him. I love him.

354
00:19:56,004 --> 00:19:59,273
- That really wasrt the end of the story.
- Come on. Help me dress.

355
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:01,779
Should I wear the red one?

356
00:20:24,328 --> 00:20:27,424
I saw you across the dance floor

357
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,504
Out of the corner of my eye

358
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,068
I felt a connection

359
00:20:33,246 --> 00:20:36,878
I don't know how, I don't know why

360
00:20:37,052 --> 00:20:40,047
I shouldn't have stayed
When I saw you there

361
00:20:40,225 --> 00:20:42,422
With another man

362
00:20:42,596 --> 00:20:45,899
But as we slipped away
I thought I heard you say:

363
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,201
"This wasrt part of the plan"

364
00:20:51,115 --> 00:20:52,947
Just a meaningless kiss

365
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:57,085
It wasrt supposed to end up like this

366
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,956
Just a meaningless kiss

367
00:21:03,139 --> 00:21:05,507
Just a meaningless kiss

368
00:21:05,677 --> 00:21:08,945
We knew it was wrong
But we couldn't resist

369
00:21:09,117 --> 00:21:11,109
Just a meaningless kiss

370
00:21:11,287 --> 00:21:15,785
'Till I fell in love with you

371
00:21:15,964 --> 00:21:18,491
Girls, tell me the truth.
Are these pants too tight?

372
00:21:21,408 --> 00:21:23,104
Oh, my God, I gotta get up there.

373
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:24,975
And here we are two years later

374
00:21:25,148 --> 00:21:27,550
Too late to turn back now

375
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,658
We've gotta finish
What we shouldn't have started

376
00:21:30,826 --> 00:21:33,855
We gotta walk away somehow

377
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:36,937
But it's easier said than done

378
00:21:37,106 --> 00:21:39,339
When two hearts beat as one

379
00:21:40,112 --> 00:21:42,639
And three hearts are one too many

380
00:21:42,816 --> 00:21:45,220
That's why we shouldn't have ever begun

381
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:50,161
Just a meaningless kiss

382
00:21:50,332 --> 00:21:54,067
We knew it was wrong
But we couldn't resist

383
00:21:54,241 --> 00:21:55,903
Just a meaningless kiss

384
00:21:56,077 --> 00:22:00,745
'Till I fell in love with you

385
00:22:11,842 --> 00:22:14,712
We can't go on like this forever

386
00:22:14,881 --> 00:22:17,614
When we're not meant to be together

387
00:22:17,787 --> 00:22:20,759
So leave me here on my own

388
00:22:20,927 --> 00:22:24,764
From now on I guess
I've gotta dance alone

389
00:22:26,905 --> 00:22:30,036
It wasrt supposed to end up like this

390
00:22:43,605 --> 00:22:45,837
- Alex!
- Alex!

391
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,536
- Hello, girls.
- Alex, I'm Barbara.

392
00:22:47,714 --> 00:22:50,014
In Boston, in 1989,
I came back to your hotel...

393
00:22:50,185 --> 00:22:53,625
If you wanna see Alex again,
check his website for the tour schedule.

394
00:22:53,793 --> 00:22:57,630
And the Knott's Berry Farm show
is temporarily postponed, okay?

395
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,001
Great show, huh? They love you.
They're hot for you.

396
00:23:01,174 --> 00:23:04,510
Of course, they're also hot because
so many are going through menopause.

397
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,951
Wait a minute.
Barbara from Boston. From Boston.

398
00:23:09,123 --> 00:23:12,061
I do remember that Barbara. I do.
I'm going back for one second.

399
00:23:12,229 --> 00:23:15,224
No. That's how we wind up
getting chased by angry husbands.

400
00:23:15,403 --> 00:23:17,463
- Not necessarily. She...
- Hi.

401
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,005
Well, hi.

402
00:23:19,176 --> 00:23:22,615
Hello. Hello, hello. Very good news. Yes.

403
00:23:22,784 --> 00:23:24,116
Chris, you remember Sophie?

404
00:23:24,287 --> 00:23:26,279
Planted in my memory.

405
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,957
I just wanted to apologize
for being so cryptic earlier.

406
00:23:31,133 --> 00:23:33,797
- This is my sister, Rhonda.
- Hi.

407
00:23:34,507 --> 00:23:39,416
I'm sorry. I've...
You were so great tonight.

408
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,522
We've met, haven't we? Right?
We were practically a duet there.

409
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:44,785
I know. Anyway,
could I get a quick autograph?

410
00:23:44,961 --> 00:23:46,327
You may, Rhonda.

411
00:23:46,497 --> 00:23:48,990
- Could I get a picture too?
- Only if you're single.

412
00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:51,901
I've been married 16 years,
but nothing's written in stone.

413
00:23:52,075 --> 00:23:53,407
Could you scootch? Thanks.

414
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:55,981
Also, I really wanted to thank you
for your offer.

415
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:58,620
- What offer?
- While Greg, the rhyming psychopath...

416
00:23:58,788 --> 00:23:59,848
Thanks again for him.

417
00:24:00,025 --> 00:24:03,293
- Was in my apartment, Sophie spouted
some really interesting lyrics.

418
00:24:03,465 --> 00:24:04,956
I thought she was doing plants.

419
00:24:05,135 --> 00:24:06,434
I'm holding a pose here.

420
00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:08,768
- I appreciate it...
- I need a song by Friday...

421
00:24:08,943 --> 00:24:11,779
...and it is amazingly difficult
to find a sane lyricist.

422
00:24:11,949 --> 00:24:14,044
Why don't you just
write the lyrics yourself?

423
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:17,157
- That's really not a strength of his.
- That's absolutely right.

424
00:24:17,326 --> 00:24:19,353
I once rhymed "you and me"
with "autopsy."

425
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,193
Well, that's not necessarily bad.

426
00:24:21,367 --> 00:24:23,428
You could do something with that.
You know?

427
00:24:23,605 --> 00:24:28,377
Figuring out you and me
Is like doing a love autopsy

428
00:24:28,548 --> 00:24:31,714
- You see, you see. That's quite good.
- That's not bad.

429
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:35,953
- Go on. More. How does it go?
- I have no idea.

430
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,430
Someone could have sculpted us
in this time.

431
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:39,967
You know what? Let me take it.

432
00:24:40,137 --> 00:24:43,338
They could operate all day long
And never figure out what went wrong

433
00:24:43,511 --> 00:24:46,381
My God, you are...
You are Cole Porter in panties.

434
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:50,046
Of course, having said that,
Cole Porter probably did wear panties.

435
00:24:50,225 --> 00:24:52,718
Anyway, thank you for inviting us.

436
00:24:52,896 --> 00:24:57,133
Okay, I'm just gonna take a real quick one.
Let me take it. Let me take it, Sophie.

437
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,076
- Thank you so much. That was great.
- Hang on.

438
00:25:00,245 --> 00:25:02,374
Nice to meet you guys. Bye-bye.

439
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,020
So this is where Sophie works, eh?

440
00:25:10,198 --> 00:25:12,168
Yeah. She is gonna be right out.

441
00:25:12,335 --> 00:25:14,567
Excellent. Excellent.
Thank you very much.

442
00:25:17,012 --> 00:25:18,275
So how much do you weigh?

443
00:25:18,782 --> 00:25:20,182
I fluctuate. Yeah.

444
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:26,421
Okay, look, I am terribly sorry
to barge in like this...

445
00:25:26,597 --> 00:25:29,330
...but I have decided
I cannot take no for an answer.

446
00:25:29,503 --> 00:25:31,336
- I told you that...
- You're not a writer.

447
00:25:31,507 --> 00:25:33,977
Except when you are writing poems
and short stories...

448
00:25:34,145 --> 00:25:35,945
...in the New School literary magazine.

449
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,779
I Googled you. And you were good.

450
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,548
Look, I'm flattered.

451
00:25:39,724 --> 00:25:43,686
I mean, you're one of six people
in the world who's actually read those...

452
00:25:43,865 --> 00:25:46,233
...but that doesn't mean
I can write a song.

453
00:25:46,704 --> 00:25:50,770
You already did.
Five minutes, that's all I ask.

454
00:25:51,615 --> 00:25:55,144
Please, step in. You'll enjoy this.
This is a treat.

455
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:57,458
Mr. Fletcher. Nice to see you.

456
00:25:57,627 --> 00:26:00,029
- Very nice to see you, Mia, how are you?
- Wonderful.

457
00:26:00,198 --> 00:26:02,668
I just want to get...
Can I try the new Mason & Hamlin?

458
00:26:02,837 --> 00:26:06,503
- Sure, absolutely. Be my guest.
- Thank you very much. Thanks. Please.

459
00:26:06,678 --> 00:26:10,947
This is... It's just a little something
that you might possibly recognize.

460
00:26:12,455 --> 00:26:15,656
Figuring out you and me

461
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:20,464
Is like doing a love autopsy

462
00:26:20,638 --> 00:26:23,610
They could operate all day long

463
00:26:23,778 --> 00:26:27,343
And never figure out what went wrong

464
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:30,821
Love autopsy

465
00:26:32,462 --> 00:26:34,591
Love autopsy

466
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:45,684
What went wrong?

467
00:26:51,567 --> 00:26:54,596
God. That melody is so beautiful.

468
00:26:54,774 --> 00:26:56,766
But I've never written a song.

469
00:26:56,945 --> 00:26:59,347
A song. I know, I know.
And if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.

470
00:26:59,516 --> 00:27:03,547
I just don't think I am.
I think you may be a born lyricist.

471
00:27:06,163 --> 00:27:09,363
We don't have very long,
but what I'd like to do, in an ideal world...

472
00:27:09,536 --> 00:27:11,130
...is continue the "Autopsy" song.

473
00:27:11,307 --> 00:27:14,107
But I think it's gonna be very hard
to get back from there...

474
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:17,342
...into "Way Back Into Love,"
which is the title that Cora demands.

475
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,289
What we could do is continue
with Greg "the Angel of Death's" version.

476
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,826
That's plagiarism.

477
00:27:22,996 --> 00:27:25,091
Yes. Yes, yes. Good. Excellent.

478
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:27,865
I would never in a million years
use someone else's work.

479
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:29,235
I'm very glad you agree.

480
00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:35,011
So, what we need,
we need something brand-new.

481
00:27:36,123 --> 00:27:39,527
- So let's see. A song for Cora.
- Yes.

482
00:27:39,697 --> 00:27:43,500
- Has to be called "A Way Back Into Love."
- Correct.

483
00:27:43,671 --> 00:27:45,972
And it has to be something
Cora would sing about.

484
00:27:46,142 --> 00:27:47,406
Good.

485
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:49,742
And it has to be something
you would sing about.

486
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:51,078
Good, yeah.

487
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:54,419
- What would you sing about?
- Whatever gets me the job, really.

488
00:27:54,994 --> 00:27:57,362
Oh, that's inspiring.

489
00:28:02,742 --> 00:28:07,183
Okay. Two people
searching for love, for salvation.

490
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:08,650
Good, good, I love that.

491
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:12,192
Love lost, love found.

492
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,161
Love lost again.

493
00:28:14,332 --> 00:28:17,964
Yes, this is starting to sound
a little bit like luggage, but good.

494
00:28:36,677 --> 00:28:38,236
Thanks. That's really helpful.

495
00:28:38,848 --> 00:28:41,182
It doesn't have to be perfect.
Just spit it out.

496
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:43,755
- They're just lyrics.
- "Just lyrics"?

497
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:48,392
Lyrics are important.
They're just not as important as melody.

498
00:28:49,736 --> 00:28:51,399
I really don't think you get it.

499
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:53,741
Oh, you look angry. Click your pen.

500
00:28:53,911 --> 00:28:56,849
A melody is like seeing someone
for the first time.

501
00:28:57,017 --> 00:28:58,884
The physical attraction. Sex.

502
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:01,355
I so get that.

503
00:29:01,526 --> 00:29:04,658
But then, as you get to know the person,
that's the lyrics.

504
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:07,463
Their story. Who they are underneath.

505
00:29:08,139 --> 00:29:12,410
It's the combination of the two
that makes it magic.

506
00:29:12,582 --> 00:29:14,175
Let's go for a walk.

507
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:17,324
- A walk? What, now?
- Yeah.

508
00:29:17,492 --> 00:29:21,831
Out on the streets you see things
and, you know, hear things and eat things.

509
00:29:22,001 --> 00:29:24,494
It all sort of unlocks your mind.

510
00:29:29,215 --> 00:29:30,879
This is good. This is good.

511
00:29:31,053 --> 00:29:33,319
When you hit a wall,
you gotta change the subject.

512
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:34,788
So why did PoP break up?

513
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,761
I mean, Rhonda told me
that you guys were friends growing up?

514
00:29:37,932 --> 00:29:40,266
We were, yes,
and then Colin met a new manager...

515
00:29:40,437 --> 00:29:42,670
...who convinced him
he was the star of the band.

516
00:29:42,842 --> 00:29:46,337
Shortly after, he left, taking the last
three songs we'd written together...

517
00:29:46,515 --> 00:29:50,285
...and putting them on his solo album
which went on to sell eight million records.

518
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:53,122
But how did you deal with that?

519
00:29:53,296 --> 00:29:55,233
Oh, with drugs, alcohol...

520
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,432
...and ultimately, my own solo album.

521
00:30:04,152 --> 00:30:05,380
Cool.

522
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:08,116
This copy has been in the racks
for six years.

523
00:30:08,293 --> 00:30:10,025
- Come on.
- No, no. I check every week.

524
00:30:10,197 --> 00:30:12,667
You see, I made a little mark,
there on the back. See?

525
00:30:12,835 --> 00:30:15,671
It sold only 50,000 copies,
most of those to my mother.

526
00:30:15,841 --> 00:30:18,404
Rolling Stone called it
"a crass, contrived effort...

527
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,107
...not even good enough
for a dentist chair."

528
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,785
Well, I'm sure there were other reviews.

529
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,362
There were, there were.
But none as good as that one.

530
00:30:27,532 --> 00:30:29,468
And they were right, by the way. Yeah.

531
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,467
To cut a long story short,
I gave up trying to write...

532
00:30:34,645 --> 00:30:37,412
...lost an incredible amount of money
and then my apartment.

533
00:30:37,584 --> 00:30:40,613
Chris stuck by me, booked me
an '80s reunion night on Long Island.

534
00:30:40,791 --> 00:30:42,886
And suddenly, they liked me again.

535
00:30:43,063 --> 00:30:45,295
It was weird.
It was like I'd never been away.

536
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,369
The audience was a tad older, as was I...

537
00:30:47,538 --> 00:30:50,806
...but we were very, very profoundly happy
to see each other again.

538
00:30:50,978 --> 00:30:53,814
And it went on from there.

539
00:30:53,984 --> 00:30:57,515
Cruises. Reunions. Knott's Berry Farm,
which I'm sure you're familiar with.

540
00:30:57,692 --> 00:31:01,392
Busch Gardens,
that's one of my big fixtures of the year.

541
00:31:01,565 --> 00:31:02,898
What else can I tell you?

542
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:06,600
I really appreciate
you opening up to me like this.

543
00:31:08,045 --> 00:31:11,176
I know what it's like
to live with a shadow overhead.

544
00:31:14,893 --> 00:31:16,123
What?

545
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,694
Shadow.

546
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:25,005
I've been living with a shadow overhead

547
00:31:25,948 --> 00:31:28,181
Now, that's a nice melody, isn't it?

548
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:30,151
- It's good.
- Thank you. Thank you.

549
00:31:30,324 --> 00:31:32,851
Mind you, what do you know?
You don't even like melody.

550
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:34,691
I never said that.

551
00:31:34,866 --> 00:31:36,768
You prefer the lyrics.

552
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:37,996
I don't trust you.

553
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:39,539
Your turn, what's next?

554
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,845
I think that we should get
some breakfast.

555
00:31:43,015 --> 00:31:45,816
Please, come on, we're finally
on a roll here. Listen again.

556
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:49,757
I've been living with a shadow overhead

557
00:31:49,929 --> 00:31:53,095
There'll be no more rhymes until I'm fed

558
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:54,795
Please, seriously, seriously.

559
00:31:54,973 --> 00:31:57,068
I've been living with a shadow overhead

560
00:31:57,244 --> 00:32:00,080
I could be inspired
With just a piece of bread

561
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,879
- I have the perfect place.
- Wait a minute.

562
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:04,388
It's just on the next corner.

563
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:06,461
- Keep moving and keep writing.
- All right.

564
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:10,195
I've been looking
For someone to shed some light

565
00:32:10,737 --> 00:32:12,537
- That's good. That's good.
- Yeah?

566
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:14,574
Shadows and light. You're deep.

567
00:32:14,746 --> 00:32:17,581
Okay, we need two more lines
of Cora verse. What's next?

568
00:32:17,752 --> 00:32:19,084
Soph?

569
00:32:21,993 --> 00:32:22,983
Sophie?

570
00:32:24,499 --> 00:32:26,092
What are you doing?

571
00:32:26,268 --> 00:32:27,669
Nothing.

572
00:32:27,838 --> 00:32:31,834
I thought I saw someone,
but it wasrt him. So it's fine.

573
00:32:32,013 --> 00:32:35,417
- Oh, there he is.
- What?

574
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:38,559
A very nice picture, though.
That's funny.

575
00:32:39,328 --> 00:32:42,665
Interestingly enough, I mean...
Well, it is a bookstore.

576
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,998
- So, you know, that does happen.
- What?

577
00:32:46,575 --> 00:32:48,569
Gosh, where were we? Okay.

578
00:32:48,747 --> 00:32:50,045
Shadow overhead

579
00:32:50,216 --> 00:32:54,054
Okay, can I just say, with all due respect,
that you are clearly...

580
00:32:54,224 --> 00:32:56,194
What is the word?
- Insane at this moment.

581
00:32:56,362 --> 00:32:59,198
And because, according to Chris,
we have less than 36 hours...

582
00:32:59,368 --> 00:33:02,499
...before Cora goes to do Leno,
at which point my career is over...

583
00:33:02,675 --> 00:33:08,084
...it would be infinitely better for me
if you were sane. So how can I help?

584
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,119
Do you know this book?

585
00:33:15,033 --> 00:33:18,267
Sally Michaels? Yes, yes.
Big bestseller. Yes.

586
00:33:18,439 --> 00:33:20,534
- Have you read it?
- No, of course not.

587
00:33:20,711 --> 00:33:24,776
Last book I read was The Alex Fletcher Story
by the editors of Teen Dream Magazine.

588
00:33:26,823 --> 00:33:28,292
Why?

589
00:33:32,835 --> 00:33:35,932
I'm Sally Michaels.

590
00:33:38,512 --> 00:33:42,043
I saw that they were giving these courses
on writing at the New School...

591
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,213
...so I signed up.

592
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:47,796
And my teacher was Sloan Cates.

593
00:33:47,965 --> 00:33:49,957
Brilliant, handsome.

594
00:33:50,136 --> 00:33:53,370
The truth is, I was in love with him.

595
00:33:54,144 --> 00:33:56,171
And we began spending
every minute together.

596
00:33:56,348 --> 00:34:00,152
Which is why I was sort of surprised
when his fiancee showed up.

597
00:34:01,426 --> 00:34:04,955
Yeah, he never mentioned that
he was engaged to a history professor...

598
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:07,570
...who was on a year-long sabbatical
in Spain.

599
00:34:07,737 --> 00:34:10,231
And when she popped in
for an unexpected visit...

600
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:14,007
...it sort of turned into a reenactment
of the Inquisition.

601
00:34:14,451 --> 00:34:16,978
And that... And that was that?
That was the end of that?

602
00:34:17,157 --> 00:34:19,252
Yeah. We never saw each other again.

603
00:34:19,428 --> 00:34:22,662
I dropped the class and a year later,
his new novel showed up.

604
00:34:23,068 --> 00:34:24,901
The Sally What's-it novel.

605
00:34:25,072 --> 00:34:27,805
"The tale of a student
with exalted literary aspirations...

606
00:34:27,978 --> 00:34:32,282
...who lures a brilliant writer into an affair
so she can take advantage of his connections.

607
00:34:32,787 --> 00:34:37,126
But when he tries to break it off,
she devotes herself to ruining his life."

608
00:34:37,464 --> 00:34:39,798
Well, I mean, that obviously wasrt you.

609
00:34:40,903 --> 00:34:46,745
Well, she's a lit major from Long Island,
5'4", my color hair, all my habits.

610
00:34:46,915 --> 00:34:49,944
You know, talks to herself
and asks too many questions.

611
00:34:50,122 --> 00:34:52,559
Her parents founded
a weight reduction company...

612
00:34:52,727 --> 00:34:54,492
...that now her sister runs.

613
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:56,834
Well, anyway, I...

614
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:00,269
Since then, every time I pick up a pen...

615
00:35:00,443 --> 00:35:03,848
...l'm haunted by those words
that he wrote, you know?

616
00:35:04,017 --> 00:35:07,046
"She was a brilliant mimic." You know.

617
00:35:07,223 --> 00:35:10,024
"She could ape Dorothy Parker
or Emily Dickinson...

618
00:35:10,196 --> 00:35:13,362
...but stripped of someone else's
literary clothes...

619
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:17,943
...she was a vacant,
empty imitation of a writer."

620
00:35:18,847 --> 00:35:21,842
First of all, you can't listen to some jerk.

621
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:25,724
He's not a jerk.
He's a National Book Award winner.

622
00:35:25,893 --> 00:35:29,298
Well, then, get the best revenge,
write a hit song.

623
00:35:30,202 --> 00:35:33,402
Honestly, I don't think a pop song
is gonna impress Sloan Cates.

624
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:36,610
Oh, no, of course not.
Pop is just for morons. Forgot that.

625
00:35:36,783 --> 00:35:40,051
- I didn't mean anything by it.
- Brain-dead, or taken too many drugs.

626
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:42,249
You know what I'd say
to you and Sloan Cates?

627
00:35:42,427 --> 00:35:44,590
You can take all the novels
in the world...

628
00:35:44,764 --> 00:35:47,999
...and not one of them
will make you feel as good as fast as:

629
00:35:54,885 --> 00:35:56,854
That is real poetry. Those are real poets.

630
00:35:57,023 --> 00:36:01,054
Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder,
Bob Dylan, the Beatles.

631
00:36:01,231 --> 00:36:05,193
Okay. What if one of your heroes
came up to you and said...

632
00:36:05,373 --> 00:36:07,935
You know, Smokey, what if he said:

633
00:36:08,111 --> 00:36:11,915
"Alex Fletcher,
you are a horrible songwriter"?

634
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,076
How would you react?

635
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:16,921
I know Smokey a little bit. He's too nice
a gentleman ever to say such a thing.

636
00:36:17,998 --> 00:36:21,266
Dylan might. Dylan would, actually.
In fact, Dylan did.

637
00:36:21,438 --> 00:36:26,312
Okay, Dylan walks up to you and he says,
"You are a horrible songwriter."

638
00:36:27,683 --> 00:36:29,983
- How do you react?
- I would be horribly depressed.

639
00:36:30,156 --> 00:36:32,786
Yes. I would. I would.

640
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,627
But then, after, you know,
months of brooding...

641
00:36:36,803 --> 00:36:39,638
...I would find a lyricist...

642
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:43,907
...and write a song
about how horribly depressed I was.

643
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:47,716
And it would be a big hit, everyone
would love me, and I'd make lots of money.

644
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:50,589
Suddenly I'd be less depressed
than if I just sat around...

645
00:36:50,763 --> 00:36:54,134
...being a little bit self-indulgent,
letting my misery eat away at me...

646
00:36:54,304 --> 00:36:59,211
...until I'd become an emotional wreck
and creatively completely moribund.

647
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,316
Yes, moribund.

648
00:37:07,698 --> 00:37:09,360
- Okay, let's go. Come on.
- All right.

649
00:37:10,002 --> 00:37:13,772
I've been living with a shadow overhead

650
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:17,882
I've been sleeping
With a clown above my bed

651
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:20,613
- "Clown" is not right. What is that word?
- It's "cloud."

652
00:37:20,789 --> 00:37:24,320
- Write more clearly. How can I...?
- Why would you have a clown in your bed?

653
00:37:24,497 --> 00:37:27,162
- It would not be the first time.
- Yeah, I'm not surprised.

654
00:37:27,336 --> 00:37:29,738
- Write in capital letters.
- Why don't you write it?

655
00:37:29,908 --> 00:37:32,345
I'm sorry, Khan.
We're gonna come back in one second.

656
00:37:32,513 --> 00:37:35,245
You dictate, I'll write.
And I will write like a human...

657
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,480
...and not like a small Pekingese dog.

658
00:37:37,658 --> 00:37:40,789
What are you doing, you madwoman?
You're destroying my apartment.

659
00:37:40,964 --> 00:37:43,230
I can't write from across the room.

660
00:37:43,402 --> 00:37:46,203
Well, you're not writing here.
Get back to your corner.

661
00:37:46,374 --> 00:37:47,364
I can't have you here.

662
00:37:47,543 --> 00:37:51,004
- I'll be blocked. I'll be completely stuck.
- So go out the other side.

663
00:37:51,184 --> 00:37:53,244
I've never been the other side.

664
00:37:54,123 --> 00:37:57,425
Push, push. Push, push.

665
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,870
Good. Better.

666
00:38:05,044 --> 00:38:08,175
You're still a fraction close.
Just... Just back off, just one...

667
00:38:08,351 --> 00:38:09,843
Just... Just...

668
00:38:10,022 --> 00:38:11,490
There, fine, good.

669
00:38:11,658 --> 00:38:13,150
Okay.

670
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,195
And I don't think those chords are right.

671
00:38:32,365 --> 00:38:35,235
It has to sound different than the verse.

672
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:37,632
What kind of different
did you have in mind?

673
00:38:37,811 --> 00:38:40,577
I don't know.
Something sadder, you know?

674
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:43,984
And I still don't like my line
about "places in my mind."

675
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:47,356
- It's fine.
- Fine isn't good.

676
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,056
We only have time for fine.

677
00:38:49,233 --> 00:38:51,669
I tell you what.
We'll change "places in my mind"...

678
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:54,241
...if I can keep the chord sequence
into the bridge.

679
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:55,845
This isn't a negotiation.

680
00:38:56,014 --> 00:38:59,144
It's either right or wrong,
inspired or insipid.

681
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:03,260
It's 4 in the morning. We're not writing the
last movement of the "Jupiter Symphony."

682
00:39:03,428 --> 00:39:06,457
It's a song for someone who's last hit
was "Welcome to Bootytown."

683
00:39:06,634 --> 00:39:07,933
Please, get back to work.

684
00:39:08,104 --> 00:39:10,804
I still don't like it.

685
00:39:10,977 --> 00:39:13,641
And it's "Entering Bootytown."

686
00:39:15,017 --> 00:39:17,487
And another thing,
the whole top section...

687
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,190
I mean, it's so close.
We're just not there yet.

688
00:39:20,361 --> 00:39:22,765
We just... We have to focus
and stay, you know...

689
00:39:22,934 --> 00:39:25,530
...completely understanding
of what we're trying to say.

690
00:39:25,706 --> 00:39:28,770
Okay, you may now
start killing the next one.

691
00:39:31,451 --> 00:39:36,689
All I wanna do
Is find a way back into love

692
00:39:40,269 --> 00:39:46,145
I can't make it through
Without a way back into love

693
00:39:52,393 --> 00:39:54,055
You know, I'm tone-deaf.

694
00:40:15,906 --> 00:40:18,172
Hey, what do you think of this?

695
00:40:18,345 --> 00:40:21,715
Just keep writing.
Cora is leaving in an hour.

696
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:51,938
Listen, I was thinking that "corners"
was such a better word than "spaces."

697
00:40:52,111 --> 00:40:55,312
For "in the mind." "The corners
of my mind," rather than "the spaces."

698
00:40:55,485 --> 00:40:58,787
It just seems to have a better boundary
to it, you know?

699
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,160
Should I speak to you
about this later? Okay.

700
00:41:11,483 --> 00:41:14,718
It sounds so good. I can't believe it.

701
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,655
And now...

702
00:41:16,828 --> 00:41:18,296
...vocals.

703
00:41:18,465 --> 00:41:22,097
No, you see, you have to sing
into the microphone. It won't follow you.

704
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:24,538
- But I can't.
- It's a duet for a man and a woman.

705
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,236
We are as close as we've got.

706
00:41:26,413 --> 00:41:30,080
Your headphones and a level. You look nice.
You should wear them all the time.

707
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,554
How is that?

708
00:41:32,726 --> 00:41:33,785
- Yes?
- Okay!

709
00:41:35,732 --> 00:41:36,893
It's okay.

710
00:41:37,068 --> 00:41:39,265
And...

711
00:41:40,977 --> 00:41:43,914
..."Way Back Into Love." Take one.

712
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:46,349
Oh, God. I'm getting really nervous.

713
00:41:46,521 --> 00:41:48,787
You'll be fine.
Just use your normal nice voice...

714
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:51,360
...that I've heard so much of
in the last three days.

715
00:41:51,531 --> 00:41:54,662
It's like my throat's closing up.
It's like anaphylactic.

716
00:41:54,837 --> 00:41:57,103
It's fine. It's just a three-minute song.

717
00:42:01,517 --> 00:42:06,322
I've been living with a shadow overhead

718
00:42:06,493 --> 00:42:07,985
I've been sleeping with a...

719
00:42:08,164 --> 00:42:10,964
Just a little bit louder.
This song is intended for humans.

720
00:42:11,137 --> 00:42:13,869
"Way Back Into Love." Take two.

721
00:42:16,914 --> 00:42:21,549
I've been living with a shadow overhead

722
00:42:21,724 --> 00:42:26,359
I've been sleeping
With a cloud above my bed

723
00:42:26,533 --> 00:42:29,733
I've been lonely for so long

724
00:42:30,776 --> 00:42:35,649
Trapped in the past
I just can't seem to move on

725
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:40,787
I've been hiding all my hopes
And dreams away

726
00:42:40,962 --> 00:42:45,870
Just in case I ever need 'em
Again someday

727
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:48,943
I've been setting aside time

728
00:42:49,713 --> 00:42:54,951
To clear a little space
In the corners of my mind

729
00:42:56,026 --> 00:43:02,631
All I wanna do
Is find a way back into love

730
00:43:05,578 --> 00:43:12,457
I can't make it through
Without a way back into love

731
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,727
Hey, hey! Taxi! She's gonna have a baby!

732
00:43:15,899 --> 00:43:18,028
Hey, what if that were true?

733
00:43:18,203 --> 00:43:19,193
Another one.

734
00:43:47,362 --> 00:43:49,889
- Oh, my God. It's Cora.
- Okay, stay calm.

735
00:43:50,067 --> 00:43:52,538
- C, you remember Alex Fletcher.
- How are you, C?

736
00:43:52,706 --> 00:43:54,504
- Hi, Alex.
- Sophie Fisher, my lyricist.

737
00:43:54,677 --> 00:43:56,646
Hi. Aspiring lyricist, actually.

738
00:43:56,813 --> 00:43:58,511
So Ray tells me you have a song.

739
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,492
We do. A little ditty. It's just a rough...

740
00:44:02,658 --> 00:44:05,653
Yeah, go ahead, take it. Help yourself.

741
00:44:05,831 --> 00:44:07,391
Oh, we're gonna do it now?

742
00:44:07,569 --> 00:44:11,099
Great, great. No time like the present.

743
00:44:11,277 --> 00:44:15,614
Very rough. Just put together
in my little studio. Both of us singing.

744
00:44:15,785 --> 00:44:17,879
She's gonna hear my voice,
it's gonna ruin it.

745
00:44:18,056 --> 00:44:19,046
It's gonna be fine.

746
00:44:24,469 --> 00:44:27,032
Anyone see Battle of the '80s Has-Beens
the other night?

747
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:29,201
That Debbie Gibson,
she can take a punch.

748
00:44:35,057 --> 00:44:36,959
I didn't see it.

749
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:28,621
This is the song I've been looking for.
I can't wait to work on it.

750
00:45:28,798 --> 00:45:30,596
Congratulations, guys. We gotta book.

751
00:45:30,767 --> 00:45:33,603
Thank you so much.
Looking forward to working with you guys.

752
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:34,901
Congratulations.

753
00:45:35,077 --> 00:45:36,477
- D Money!
- Let's go home.

754
00:45:36,646 --> 00:45:37,910
This way, folks.

755
00:45:39,085 --> 00:45:40,748
It's unbelievable. We got the job.

756
00:45:41,557 --> 00:45:43,789
I thank you. Thank you.

757
00:45:44,729 --> 00:45:47,826
I thank you, I thank you...

758
00:45:50,941 --> 00:45:53,811
Yes? Chris, she loved it.

759
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:55,746
Unbelievable!

760
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,912
Definitely. Where are you?

761
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:59,853
Okay, got it. Got it.

762
00:46:00,026 --> 00:46:02,259
We're going to dinner. Come on.

763
00:46:03,767 --> 00:46:08,676
To Sophie Fisher, the woman who paved
my way back to Knott's Berry Farm.

764
00:46:08,843 --> 00:46:10,574
Gloria, I love your dress.

765
00:46:10,748 --> 00:46:13,743
Oh, thank you.
It's nice to clean up after a day of work.

766
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:15,047
Where do you work?

767
00:46:15,224 --> 00:46:17,593
I'm a therapist at Columbia-Presbyterian.

768
00:46:17,762 --> 00:46:20,164
I'm working on a study
examining the relationship...

769
00:46:20,334 --> 00:46:21,359
Oh, my God.

770
00:46:21,536 --> 00:46:24,029
That's a strike against us, right?
I mean...

771
00:46:24,208 --> 00:46:27,339
What is it? What?

772
00:46:27,514 --> 00:46:29,781
- Sloan.
- Sloan?

773
00:46:32,858 --> 00:46:35,329
Mr. Cates, good evening.
How are you? Nice to see you.

774
00:46:35,498 --> 00:46:37,330
I'd say about two minutes.

775
00:46:39,739 --> 00:46:42,404
- Hi, how you doing?
- Here it comes.

776
00:46:44,048 --> 00:46:45,710
Here's the thing...

777
00:47:00,547 --> 00:47:01,948
Is she all right?

778
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:06,921
Yeah, she always does this.
It's her way of working up an appetite.

779
00:47:07,094 --> 00:47:08,084
Hang on.

780
00:47:14,676 --> 00:47:16,645
Hello? Sophie?

781
00:47:16,814 --> 00:47:18,282
He's at the bar.

782
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:21,216
I know. I know. I know.
I saw him. I saw him.

783
00:47:21,389 --> 00:47:24,520
He's not that great, you know.
I saw the beginnings of a bald patch.

784
00:47:24,695 --> 00:47:28,032
- Why, come and have a look.
- Oh, he has a great head of hair.

785
00:47:28,203 --> 00:47:29,502
Oh, God.

786
00:47:29,673 --> 00:47:31,836
I think I'll just stay in here
until he leaves.

787
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:34,537
Maybe you could send in a salad
and an iced tea?

788
00:47:34,715 --> 00:47:37,950
Right. I'll get the waiter.
Would you like the dessert can't as well?

789
00:47:38,123 --> 00:47:40,025
Look, this is ridiculous.

790
00:47:41,028 --> 00:47:43,225
I've been dreaming
about confronting him too.

791
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,372
I had a speech prepared for over a year.

792
00:47:47,408 --> 00:47:49,469
Would you like to hear it?

793
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,147
Very, very much.

794
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,652
Hello there. Good evening.

795
00:47:58,696 --> 00:48:03,331
Sloan, even though Sally Michaels
only lives on paper...

796
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:04,941
...I live in the world.

797
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:08,310
And I can never forgive you
for using me as raw material...

798
00:48:08,483 --> 00:48:10,510
...to create a fictional monster.

799
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:13,055
Sally Michaels
is my own personal ghost...

800
00:48:13,226 --> 00:48:16,687
...a shadow hanging over each phone call
and cup of iced tea.

801
00:48:16,867 --> 00:48:21,034
And one cold day, when age
has robbed your mind of its fertile phrases...

802
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:24,978
...and your hand of its dexterity, all
the success won't be able to shield you...

803
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,746
...from the pain you've caused
and the shame you deserve.

804
00:48:27,921 --> 00:48:29,824
Or something like that.

805
00:48:30,427 --> 00:48:32,830
But now I know
I could never actually say it to him.

806
00:48:32,998 --> 00:48:36,266
No. You have to say that. You have
to say that. You have to say it now.

807
00:48:36,439 --> 00:48:38,842
Now is the perfect time.
You're on top of the world.

808
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:41,413
You wrote a song
for the biggest act in the universe.

809
00:48:41,582 --> 00:48:42,880
- But I can't.
- Yeah, you can.

810
00:48:43,051 --> 00:48:45,716
People wait to see an ex-lover
when things are going well.

811
00:48:45,891 --> 00:48:48,658
It never happens.
You can make relationship history here.

812
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:52,167
But I can't. I mean, look at me.
I haven't showered in days.

813
00:48:52,337 --> 00:48:55,605
I'm covered in songwriting grime.
The helicopter flew bugs in my teeth.

814
00:48:55,777 --> 00:48:58,874
Yes, yes, yes. You are a little mangy.

815
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,453
Wait. Wait. Stay.

816
00:49:08,704 --> 00:49:11,676
Sorry, Gloria.
Can I ask you a great favor?

817
00:49:11,843 --> 00:49:15,337
Could you accompany me
to the ladies' room?

818
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,814
He's a good guy. Go ahead.

819
00:49:19,993 --> 00:49:23,124
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Sure. Be right back.

820
00:49:31,616 --> 00:49:34,452
- That's fantastic.
- You look great.

821
00:49:34,622 --> 00:49:37,822
Eleven years of therapy and I finally
help someone. Good luck, honey.

822
00:49:37,996 --> 00:49:38,986
Thank you so much.

823
00:49:39,163 --> 00:49:41,657
Yes, thank you. Thank you, doctor.

824
00:49:42,336 --> 00:49:43,327
It doesn't really fit.

825
00:49:43,506 --> 00:49:45,908
- No, on the contrary. It fits you perfectly.
- Really?

826
00:49:46,077 --> 00:49:48,640
I'm not saying you should go
to confession like that...

827
00:49:48,816 --> 00:49:51,218
...but for what you're about to do,
it's perfect.

828
00:49:52,691 --> 00:49:54,250
Okay. Are you ready?

829
00:49:54,962 --> 00:49:57,798
I think I'm developing
a sudden coronary blockage.

830
00:49:57,968 --> 00:49:59,369
Those pass very quickly, okay?

831
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,269
Shortness of breath. Blurred vision.

832
00:50:01,442 --> 00:50:02,911
- You're fine.
- Scurvy?

833
00:50:04,147 --> 00:50:05,707
You're beautiful. No, it's fine.

834
00:50:05,885 --> 00:50:08,583
"I don't write bestsellers
because I despise humanity."

835
00:50:08,757 --> 00:50:13,460
And I said, "No, John, you don't write
bestsellers because the feeling is mutual."

836
00:50:14,668 --> 00:50:18,005
Should I have stopped? Should
I have stopped right there? Was it over?

837
00:50:18,175 --> 00:50:22,583
Hi. Sophie. My God, Sophie.

838
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,917
How are you?

839
00:50:28,396 --> 00:50:30,059
I'm fine, yeah.

840
00:50:30,232 --> 00:50:32,760
Good, it's great to see you.

841
00:50:32,939 --> 00:50:37,276
- Alex Fletcher. Hi, how are you?
- Hey, Alex. Sloan Cates. How are you?

842
00:50:37,447 --> 00:50:41,649
Well, it's been an eternity.
You look incredible.

843
00:50:42,323 --> 00:50:45,922
Then you were always
mysteriously seductive, werert you?

844
00:50:46,699 --> 00:50:49,535
She is writing a song for Cora Corman.

845
00:50:50,507 --> 00:50:54,412
What? No. Wait. You're a songwriter?

846
00:50:54,581 --> 00:50:57,144
L... I wrote...

847
00:50:57,319 --> 00:50:59,347
Brilliant lyrics. Fantastic lyrics.

848
00:50:59,525 --> 00:51:02,190
A lot of people
are talking about them, actually.

849
00:51:02,364 --> 00:51:04,926
I had a pen, a paper and wrote...

850
00:51:07,507 --> 00:51:11,915
Sloan, the thing is, even though
Sally Michaels only lives on paper...

851
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:13,711
...Sophie lives in the real world.

852
00:51:13,886 --> 00:51:15,116
She can never forgive you...

853
00:51:15,289 --> 00:51:17,817
- Mr. Cates, your table's ready.
- Great, thanks, Stefan.

854
00:51:17,995 --> 00:51:21,229
Listen, I'll be right there, guys. I'm sorry.

855
00:51:21,401 --> 00:51:24,135
They're throwing
this little dinner thing for me.

856
00:51:24,307 --> 00:51:27,279
It's crazy how lavish people get
no matter how cheap they are...

857
00:51:27,446 --> 00:51:29,474
...when Hollywood comes calling.
- Hollywood.

858
00:51:29,651 --> 00:51:32,350
I've sold out. They're making a film
out of Sally Michaels.

859
00:51:32,524 --> 00:51:33,513
- Really?
- Yeah.

860
00:51:33,693 --> 00:51:35,891
It's been crazy. I wrote the script.

861
00:51:36,065 --> 00:51:38,467
We're seeing actresses.
It's been... You know.

862
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:42,741
But listen, it's great seeing you.
Let's get together, okay?

863
00:51:45,216 --> 00:51:47,014
Take care of yourself.

864
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:51,191
Take care, Allen.

865
00:51:56,004 --> 00:51:57,472
Well...

866
00:51:58,108 --> 00:52:00,705
...must feel good to get that over with.

867
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:06,154
I just wanna go home.

868
00:52:06,324 --> 00:52:08,887
Okay. Okay. Okay.

869
00:52:09,064 --> 00:52:12,230
Hang on. Just hang on one second.
One second.

870
00:52:13,038 --> 00:52:15,236
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry to bother you.

871
00:52:15,409 --> 00:52:18,746
It would mean the world if you'd
just let her say what she came to say.

872
00:52:18,916 --> 00:52:20,715
I know what she came here to say, okay?

873
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:23,723
Some sad little story
about how I ruined her life...

874
00:52:23,893 --> 00:52:25,361
...while the truth is...

875
00:52:28,234 --> 00:52:31,172
...that she seduced me
so that I'd help get her published, okay?

876
00:52:31,341 --> 00:52:34,336
Come on. You were engaged
and you never even told her.

877
00:52:34,848 --> 00:52:37,114
I'd say we're done talking.

878
00:52:37,286 --> 00:52:38,721
Bye-bye.

879
00:52:41,929 --> 00:52:44,298
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

880
00:52:44,468 --> 00:52:46,369
Wait.

881
00:52:48,175 --> 00:52:51,204
Do me a favor.
Why don't you just shove off?

882
00:52:51,381 --> 00:52:54,877
I appreciate your request,
but why don't you just shove off?

883
00:52:55,055 --> 00:52:58,255
- Take it easy, my friend.
- I don't believe I will take it easy.

884
00:52:59,297 --> 00:53:01,061
All right. All right!

885
00:53:02,303 --> 00:53:06,003
Don't hurt his hair.
He's working Adventureland this weekend.

886
00:53:06,178 --> 00:53:08,740
I'm giving up. My face is in the butter.

887
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:14,216
Thank you.

888
00:53:14,995 --> 00:53:16,658
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

889
00:53:16,832 --> 00:53:20,431
It's just my PoP hip. It comes from years
of doing our patented dance move.

890
00:53:20,606 --> 00:53:22,701
My God, I've suffered for my art.

891
00:53:22,877 --> 00:53:25,074
No, the thing that really hurts
is my upper gum.

892
00:53:25,248 --> 00:53:27,582
I think I may have impaled myself
on a dinner roll.

893
00:53:27,753 --> 00:53:30,691
Good thing they didn't have breadsticks.
I could've lost an eye.

894
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,887
Well, you should get some ice on that.

895
00:53:33,065 --> 00:53:35,227
Only if it's attached to some whiskey.

896
00:53:35,403 --> 00:53:38,569
Oh, God. I can't believe
you convinced me to do that.

897
00:53:38,742 --> 00:53:41,839
Now I'm more of a joke to him than ever.

898
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,005
And to top it off...

899
00:53:43,451 --> 00:53:46,822
...l'll have my own personal nightmare
playing on 3000 screens.

900
00:53:46,992 --> 00:53:49,725
And you know what the worst part is?

901
00:53:49,898 --> 00:53:51,594
You stole some poor womars dress?

902
00:53:51,767 --> 00:53:56,403
The worst part is that
he still has some kind of power over me.

903
00:53:56,578 --> 00:53:58,605
I still care what he thinks.

904
00:53:58,782 --> 00:54:01,150
I'm sorry, but how?

905
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:05,785
How can that possibly be?
The guy is a jerk.

906
00:54:07,065 --> 00:54:08,864
Well, that's easy for you to say, but...

907
00:54:09,036 --> 00:54:12,099
No. He is a jerk. He is a jerk.
It's not a question. He is a jerk.

908
00:54:12,277 --> 00:54:15,408
No, he is, he's a jerk. He's a jerk.
Okay, here's what I think.

909
00:54:15,582 --> 00:54:19,113
I think that the truth is that you are terrified
of losing Sally Michaels...

910
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:23,732
...because you'd have nothing to hide behind
and you'd have to stand on your own feet.

911
00:54:26,505 --> 00:54:30,502
Wow. I didn't see that coming.

912
00:54:30,913 --> 00:54:32,507
No. Well...

913
00:54:32,684 --> 00:54:34,585
...I have amazing insight.

914
00:54:34,754 --> 00:54:37,520
I would use it on myself,
only I don't have any problems.

915
00:54:38,963 --> 00:54:40,796
And I will tell you my other insight.

916
00:54:40,967 --> 00:54:44,805
I think you are way too talented
and gifted...

917
00:54:44,975 --> 00:54:49,279
...and unusual to let anyone
keep you from standing.

918
00:54:53,692 --> 00:54:56,424
That's wonderfully sensitive, Alex.

919
00:54:56,598 --> 00:54:59,330
Especially from a man
who wears such tight pants.

920
00:54:59,871 --> 00:55:02,364
It forces all the blood to my heart.

921
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:13,051
Listen.

922
00:55:13,595 --> 00:55:16,499
You were amazing tonight.

923
00:55:17,303 --> 00:55:18,669
As were you.

924
00:55:18,838 --> 00:55:21,504
The few syllables you got out
were absolutely devastating.

925
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:28,953
Does this feel any better?

926
00:55:29,393 --> 00:55:31,590
It would if it was on the right side.

927
00:55:44,457 --> 00:55:46,120
And that...

928
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:49,599
...felt much better.

929
00:56:47,416 --> 00:56:50,183
- Hello? Hello?
- Hey, buddy.

930
00:56:50,355 --> 00:56:51,948
How's my hit songwriter?

931
00:56:52,593 --> 00:56:53,960
Hang on. Just... Just hang on.

932
00:56:55,365 --> 00:56:58,531
You don't sound right.
Maybe it's the connect... Hello?

933
00:56:59,273 --> 00:57:01,105
I have a strange situation here.

934
00:57:01,277 --> 00:57:03,510
Oh, you've got a strange situation?

935
00:57:03,682 --> 00:57:07,986
I'm at Beth's soccer game with my ex-wife
who's here with my ex-gardener.

936
00:57:08,157 --> 00:57:10,252
They came on a riding mower.

937
00:57:10,428 --> 00:57:11,897
I slept with Sophie.

938
00:57:12,065 --> 00:57:14,832
You slept with Sophie?

939
00:57:15,005 --> 00:57:18,445
Remember your blood pressure.
You're a tall man. You need all you can get.

940
00:57:18,612 --> 00:57:21,675
Are you out of your mind?
Alex, this is terrible.

941
00:57:21,851 --> 00:57:25,917
Unless, of course, you're happy about it,
and then I couldn't be more pleased for you.

942
00:57:26,093 --> 00:57:28,085
- Should we do pros and cons?
- Not necessary.

943
00:57:29,701 --> 00:57:32,103
- I think she's up. I gotta go.
- We got a show today.

944
00:57:32,272 --> 00:57:34,674
Two o'clock. I'm gonna pick you up
in a little while.

945
00:57:34,843 --> 00:57:38,442
I want you to wear the white shirt
with the fan-friendly pants.

946
00:57:38,618 --> 00:57:41,146
Too much. Too much.
Hanging up on you. Hanging up.

947
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:43,014
Good morning.

948
00:57:44,296 --> 00:57:46,995
- Hi.
- That was Chris just checking in.

949
00:57:47,804 --> 00:57:51,505
So I'm gonna help clean up a little bit...

950
00:57:51,678 --> 00:57:54,012
...seeing as we don't
have any work today.

951
00:57:54,183 --> 00:57:56,380
Right. Fine. Thank you. Very nice of you.

952
00:57:56,554 --> 00:57:59,994
I would obviously invite you to stay,
it's just that I have a show today.

953
00:58:00,663 --> 00:58:02,826
- Oh, really?
- Oh, yes. A big one.

954
00:58:03,001 --> 00:58:05,403
I'm headlining
at Adventureland Amusement Park:

955
00:58:05,572 --> 00:58:07,599
Long Island's family fun center.

956
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:10,247
Biggest outdoor amusement center
east of Rye Playland.

957
00:58:10,415 --> 00:58:13,444
- You have my permission to be impressed.
- Sounds great.

958
00:58:13,621 --> 00:58:16,148
- Okay.
- Yeah.

959
00:58:16,327 --> 00:58:18,456
- So.
- So.

960
00:58:20,301 --> 00:58:21,793
I mean, you...

961
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:25,742
You could come.

962
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:37,334
I said I wasrt gonna lose my head

963
00:58:37,502 --> 00:58:42,171
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

964
00:58:42,345 --> 00:58:44,873
I wasrt gonna fall in love again

965
00:58:45,051 --> 00:58:48,956
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

966
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:54,330
And I just can't let you go

967
00:58:54,503 --> 00:58:57,498
I can't lose this feeling

968
00:58:59,881 --> 00:59:01,679
Okay. Let's hear everyone clapping.

969
00:59:03,387 --> 00:59:07,623
Hey, come on. These guys over here on line
at the Little Dipper, let's hear you clapping.

970
00:59:10,468 --> 00:59:12,335
Don't... Don't if you don't want to.

971
00:59:12,506 --> 00:59:15,535
A twist of fate makes life won'thwhile

972
00:59:15,713 --> 00:59:20,677
You are gold and silver

973
00:59:20,856 --> 00:59:23,122
I said I wasrt gonna lose my head

974
00:59:23,294 --> 00:59:26,824
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

975
00:59:27,002 --> 00:59:32,843
And I just can't let you go

976
00:59:37,756 --> 00:59:41,993
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Adventureland. Thank you.

977
00:59:43,133 --> 00:59:45,127
Thank you.

978
00:59:46,339 --> 00:59:48,777
That was great. That was great.

979
00:59:48,946 --> 00:59:51,007
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

980
00:59:51,183 --> 00:59:53,585
Good show.
All right, you gotta do the encore.

981
00:59:54,456 --> 00:59:57,622
- Do I really have to?
- It's in the contract.

982
00:59:57,797 --> 01:00:00,393
Wanna do "Meaningless Kiss"
or "Dance With Me Tonight"?

983
01:00:01,169 --> 01:00:03,106
This is embarrassing. They don't want it.

984
01:00:03,274 --> 01:00:06,075
No, it's not.
These songs, they're fantastic.

985
01:00:06,781 --> 01:00:08,909
I mean, I've never heard
most of them before...

986
01:00:09,086 --> 01:00:12,992
...but they're full of wonderful
melodic surprises and they're catchy...

987
01:00:13,159 --> 01:00:15,757
...and they're making people happy
and they're just good.

988
01:00:15,933 --> 01:00:18,301
So you should be incredibly proud
to sing them.

989
01:00:20,173 --> 01:00:23,145
You're not just saying that
because you've been on the wave ride?

990
01:00:23,314 --> 01:00:26,286
They're good, really good.

991
01:00:30,328 --> 01:00:33,698
Okay, then.
"Dance With Me Tonight," please.

992
01:00:33,869 --> 01:00:37,000
It's not often one man
gets to say that to another with such joy.

993
01:00:42,452 --> 01:00:44,080
Thank you.

994
01:00:46,259 --> 01:00:48,891
Okay. PoP face.

995
01:00:59,653 --> 01:01:01,555
Thank you.

996
01:01:09,373 --> 01:01:11,843
It's been so long

997
01:01:12,012 --> 01:01:14,812
Since I've known right from wrong

998
01:01:14,983 --> 01:01:16,782
Got no job

999
01:01:16,954 --> 01:01:20,394
Sometimes I just sit down and sob

1000
01:01:20,561 --> 01:01:25,629
Wondering if anything will go right

1001
01:01:27,208 --> 01:01:31,080
Or will you dance with me tonight

1002
01:01:31,249 --> 01:01:33,186
When the sun departs

1003
01:01:33,354 --> 01:01:36,520
I feel a hole down in my heart

1004
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,127
Put on some shoes

1005
01:01:38,296 --> 01:01:42,260
Come down here and listen to the blues

1006
01:01:42,439 --> 01:01:47,780
Wondering if anything will go right

1007
01:01:49,052 --> 01:01:52,616
Or will you dance with me tonight

1008
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:55,228
I'm looking at you

1009
01:01:55,397 --> 01:01:57,698
You're looking at me

1010
01:01:57,870 --> 01:02:01,104
We're the only two off the dance floor

1011
01:02:01,275 --> 01:02:03,508
Do you see what I see?

1012
01:02:03,681 --> 01:02:06,175
Two broken lives

1013
01:02:06,353 --> 01:02:08,619
Working in harmony

1014
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:11,490
Might make for a decent time

1015
01:02:11,663 --> 01:02:13,758
So get up and dance with me

1016
01:02:15,771 --> 01:02:18,071
It was a great show.
You should be very pleased.

1017
01:02:18,244 --> 01:02:19,837
How much money did we make?

1018
01:02:20,013 --> 01:02:23,008
I don't talk business in front of a non-client.
You know that.

1019
01:02:23,186 --> 01:02:25,749
Actually, I'm thinking
about signing with you.

1020
01:02:26,359 --> 01:02:30,026
Well, well, thank you, Sophie.
That's... That's terrific.

1021
01:02:30,201 --> 01:02:34,141
In that case, I don't think it's right
to talk about one client's business affairs...

1022
01:02:34,308 --> 01:02:36,906
...in front of another client.
I'm discreet that way.

1023
01:02:37,081 --> 01:02:40,144
You don't know how much money
we made, do you?

1024
01:02:40,755 --> 01:02:42,121
I have a ballpark figure.

1025
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:43,817
Is it enough for a nice dinner?

1026
01:02:43,994 --> 01:02:46,830
Dinner. I'm supposed to go
to Rhonda's for dinner. I'm late.

1027
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,833
Oh, God, help.

1028
01:02:49,005 --> 01:02:52,808
You know, she wouldn't yell at me
if you came.

1029
01:02:55,483 --> 01:02:57,249
Oh, very well.

1030
01:03:00,394 --> 01:03:02,226
I can't go.

1031
01:03:07,474 --> 01:03:10,378
I'm losing my mind.
You've got me frazzled.

1032
01:03:11,783 --> 01:03:15,484
- Oh, there you go. You're gonna love these.
- Thank you. That's plenty. Honestly.

1033
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:18,357
Trust me, you're gonna want
even more than that. Say when.

1034
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:21,798
When, when, when. Thank you.
Thank you. That's plenty. Thank you.

1035
01:03:21,971 --> 01:03:23,370
- One more. Trust me.
- No.

1036
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:25,908
Listen, now, I don't wanna be
presumptuous...

1037
01:03:26,078 --> 01:03:28,948
...but I'm about to open
a new Weight-Not in Boca...

1038
01:03:29,118 --> 01:03:31,588
...and I was wondering
if maybe you'd like to perform.

1039
01:03:31,757 --> 01:03:34,820
Sounds wonderful. I performed
at a fat farm once. They loved me.

1040
01:03:34,996 --> 01:03:37,398
I threw out treats from the stage.
They went crazy.

1041
01:03:37,567 --> 01:03:39,036
It was like a dietetic Altamont.

1042
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:42,198
That's funny.

1043
01:03:42,378 --> 01:03:45,714
- Honey, no cell phones at the table.
- Could be Jessie about the meeting.

1044
01:03:45,885 --> 01:03:49,449
If we break the rules, what'll the kids think?
Don't. Sorry, Alex. Very rude.

1045
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:52,620
Weirdo, is there a way
we could go to the Cora show?

1046
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:54,996
- That would be so cool.
- We could work that out.

1047
01:03:55,171 --> 01:03:57,698
I believe we can.
I believe we've become close friends.

1048
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:59,572
Don't bug him with stuff like that.

1049
01:03:59,746 --> 01:04:03,082
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Apologies.
I know the rules. Turn it off.

1050
01:04:03,252 --> 01:04:05,917
Oh, no, honey. You go right ahead.
You're a guest.

1051
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,996
You sure? You want me
to call Jessie back while I'm...?

1052
01:04:09,499 --> 01:04:10,797
I'll be very quick.

1053
01:04:10,968 --> 01:04:13,734
Chris, yes? Say that again.
Cora's people what?

1054
01:04:13,907 --> 01:04:15,604
What? Is it about the song?

1055
01:04:15,978 --> 01:04:17,071
Really?

1056
01:04:17,247 --> 01:04:18,682
- What does he say?
- It's Sophie.

1057
01:04:19,419 --> 01:04:20,910
Really?

1058
01:04:21,556 --> 01:04:23,822
Okay. Okay, got it.

1059
01:04:24,362 --> 01:04:25,830
Cora is back in town tomorrow...

1060
01:04:25,998 --> 01:04:29,493
...and wants to meet us at her studio
to work on the song.

1061
01:04:29,672 --> 01:04:32,769
And she wants to know
if we like wheatgrass.

1062
01:04:32,945 --> 01:04:34,881
- Sounds ominous.
- Are you worried?

1063
01:04:35,049 --> 01:04:38,544
- Well, I don't... You know, yeah.
- Lf you're not worried, I'm not worried.

1064
01:04:38,724 --> 01:04:42,185
You've got your worried eyes.
You look like a little worried doggy.

1065
01:04:52,717 --> 01:04:55,689
Sophie, bring those dishes in here, hon.

1066
01:05:00,701 --> 01:05:03,832
Okay, honey. You lead, I'll follow.

1067
01:05:08,182 --> 01:05:10,380
- There you go. There you go.
- What?

1068
01:05:10,921 --> 01:05:12,515
Nothing. Just looking.

1069
01:05:14,261 --> 01:05:16,527
What? What? What, what, what?

1070
01:05:16,699 --> 01:05:20,298
- Well, look. As your older sister...
- Seven years older.

1071
01:05:20,473 --> 01:05:21,840
Now, that's just uncalled for.

1072
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:24,607
Why do you do that?
It just... It hurts, you know?

1073
01:05:24,782 --> 01:05:28,846
Look. I like Alex, you know.
I mean, he's Alex Fletcher. So hot.

1074
01:05:29,024 --> 01:05:30,425
And he ate my mashed potatoes.

1075
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:32,187
Yes. It was a magical evening.

1076
01:05:32,364 --> 01:05:34,561
But look, hon, you don't fall a lot.

1077
01:05:34,735 --> 01:05:38,266
And I've seen the way you look at him,
so if you are falling for him...

1078
01:05:38,442 --> 01:05:41,938
...just please, please make sure
he's passionate about you.

1079
01:05:42,117 --> 01:05:46,456
Well, you know, I mean, I'm not falling.
We're just working together, you know?

1080
01:05:46,625 --> 01:05:50,326
And besides, the one time we slept
together, it's been totally professional.

1081
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:51,969
- You did not.
- I did.

1082
01:05:52,137 --> 01:05:54,039
You slept with Alex Fletcher?

1083
01:05:54,207 --> 01:05:55,437
Oh, my God.

1084
01:05:56,612 --> 01:05:58,276
Don't worry about it, all right?

1085
01:06:01,655 --> 01:06:05,790
Besides, you know,
how do you know who's passionate?

1086
01:06:07,335 --> 01:06:11,104
You know, I think you...
I think you just see it in their eyes.

1087
01:06:11,275 --> 01:06:13,871
And you feel it in their touch.

1088
01:06:14,281 --> 01:06:17,846
In Gary's case, it was when he said
to his mother, "I'm marrying her anyway."

1089
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:20,185
God, I hate her.

1090
01:06:21,395 --> 01:06:24,766
I don't know. I think it's just
when they do something extraordinary.

1091
01:06:25,703 --> 01:06:28,231
Soph, just be careful, okay?

1092
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:29,878
Okay.

1093
01:06:35,423 --> 01:06:39,386
And bigger. And bigger. And bigger.

1094
01:06:41,268 --> 01:06:43,101
With claps, and:

1095
01:06:45,176 --> 01:06:48,080
Ready to spin. And:

1096
01:06:54,194 --> 01:06:56,756
Well, that was fun.

1097
01:06:56,933 --> 01:06:59,199
It was, it was, it was.
Except for those potatoes.

1098
01:06:59,371 --> 01:07:01,739
What I imagine eating insulation
would taste like.

1099
01:07:03,112 --> 01:07:05,811
So Cora tomorrow?

1100
01:07:05,984 --> 01:07:09,320
Yes, tomorrow, 10:00,
her studio, 19th Street.

1101
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:13,254
- Should I meet you there?
- That would be fine.

1102
01:07:13,433 --> 01:07:15,197
Although I was gonna take a cab.

1103
01:07:15,369 --> 01:07:17,566
And seeing as I live
further uptown than you...

1104
01:07:17,741 --> 01:07:20,007
...I could, theoretically, pick you up.

1105
01:07:20,613 --> 01:07:24,109
You could if I was on the street
at, say, like, 9:40.

1106
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:27,316
I would probably see you, depending
how brightly you were dressed.

1107
01:07:27,494 --> 01:07:29,396
I'd wear orange so you couldn't miss me.

1108
01:07:29,564 --> 01:07:31,830
You could get some road work done
while you wait.

1109
01:07:37,747 --> 01:07:41,278
Well, goodbye and thank you.
Thank you very much for this. I enjoyed it.

1110
01:07:41,455 --> 01:07:45,088
- And thank you for your support today.
- Thank you. Today was great.

1111
01:07:46,165 --> 01:07:48,226
- It was.
- Okay. Bye.

1112
01:07:48,402 --> 01:07:49,961
Goodbye.

1113
01:07:57,655 --> 01:07:58,680
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1114
01:08:31,088 --> 01:08:34,550
I want you to hear the new intro
to "Way Back Into Love."

1115
01:08:34,729 --> 01:08:35,958
So imagine this:

1116
01:08:36,131 --> 01:08:38,601
Instead of just starting the song
with the piano...

1117
01:08:38,769 --> 01:08:43,211
...we get this heavy Indian thing going,
very rhythmic.

1118
01:08:46,653 --> 01:08:50,649
Derek, give me a beat:
Steamy and sticky.

1119
01:08:57,307 --> 01:09:00,872
Way back into love

1120
01:09:01,048 --> 01:09:05,284
She's been living
With a shadow overhead

1121
01:09:08,862 --> 01:09:13,497
She's been sleeping
With a cloud above her bed

1122
01:09:16,912 --> 01:09:19,475
Go Cora, go Cora

1123
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:26,263
Cora Corman and Alex Fletcher
Got a new song that's gonna getcha

1124
01:09:26,431 --> 01:09:29,995
Way back into love

1125
01:09:30,172 --> 01:09:33,942
Way back into love

1126
01:09:35,316 --> 01:09:38,914
Way back into love

1127
01:09:41,962 --> 01:09:45,561
You know, I think that I will get
some wheatgrass after all.

1128
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:50,539
- You don't like it?
- No. No, no, no, it's not that.

1129
01:09:50,713 --> 01:09:53,149
She had her eye on that wheatgrass
since we came in.

1130
01:09:53,318 --> 01:09:55,413
What you're doing,
that thing there, is great.

1131
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:58,892
It's steamy and it's sticky, you know.

1132
01:09:59,063 --> 01:10:02,092
Which is... One is normally enough,
but the combo's just amazing.

1133
01:10:02,269 --> 01:10:03,704
C, time for the press shoot.

1134
01:10:04,207 --> 01:10:06,005
I really like what we came up with.

1135
01:10:06,711 --> 01:10:10,014
Oh, and add another verse.
It doesn't feel like the song ends yet.

1136
01:10:10,186 --> 01:10:12,349
Another verse? Right.
That would be an honor, C.

1137
01:10:12,523 --> 01:10:15,290
I'm having a little pre-recording session
party at my place.

1138
01:10:15,463 --> 01:10:17,490
I want you both to come.

1139
01:10:18,067 --> 01:10:19,195
Great.

1140
01:10:19,370 --> 01:10:22,274
I think though, that...
That there... But wait...

1141
01:10:22,477 --> 01:10:24,379
Cheers. Thanks a lot, Ray.

1142
01:10:24,547 --> 01:10:27,017
Thanks, Derek. Nice one.

1143
01:10:27,186 --> 01:10:29,748
Don't speak. Don't say anything.

1144
01:10:31,762 --> 01:10:35,599
You didn't actually like that orgasm
set to the Gandhi soundtrack, did you?

1145
01:10:35,769 --> 01:10:38,798
Well, I thought it was,
you know, horrible.

1146
01:10:38,976 --> 01:10:43,042
I mean, it simultaneously destroyed
two musical cultures in under a minute.

1147
01:10:43,218 --> 01:10:44,344
We have to tell her.

1148
01:10:44,521 --> 01:10:46,013
No, no. I don't think we do.

1149
01:10:46,191 --> 01:10:48,423
Honestly, if she wants to dance,
let her dance.

1150
01:10:48,595 --> 01:10:51,658
I don't understand. Wait. I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

1151
01:10:51,835 --> 01:10:56,139
Your heroes, the Beatles, Smokey,
they would never let this happen.

1152
01:10:56,310 --> 01:10:58,874
That's a completely different thing.
They were geniuses.

1153
01:10:59,049 --> 01:11:01,646
They wrote dinner. I write dessert.

1154
01:11:01,822 --> 01:11:03,654
No. You're better than dessert.

1155
01:11:03,825 --> 01:11:06,388
That's why I'm gonna tell her
what I think at the party.

1156
01:11:06,565 --> 01:11:08,329
- You are not gonna do that.
- Yes, I am.

1157
01:11:08,502 --> 01:11:09,800
- No, you are not.
- Yes, I am.

1158
01:11:09,972 --> 01:11:12,066
In that case, you are no longer invited.

1159
01:11:12,243 --> 01:11:14,543
What? She invited me.

1160
01:11:14,714 --> 01:11:16,206
She invited us, as a team.

1161
01:11:16,384 --> 01:11:19,151
Now that we disagree,
we no longer present a united front...

1162
01:11:19,324 --> 01:11:22,125
...and are thus un-teamed
for the purposes of the invitation.

1163
01:11:22,296 --> 01:11:23,285
So are you going?

1164
01:11:23,465 --> 01:11:26,368
- I might. I don't wanna be rude.
- I don't wanna be rude either.

1165
01:11:26,538 --> 01:11:28,599
You don't think that telling the hostess...

1166
01:11:28,776 --> 01:11:31,406
...that she's destroyed
two musical cultures is rude?

1167
01:11:31,581 --> 01:11:33,174
I'm enrolling you in charm school.

1168
01:11:33,352 --> 01:11:35,982
I have to say what I think.
I can't work this way.

1169
01:11:36,156 --> 01:11:39,060
You can't work this way?
You've been a songwriter for six days.

1170
01:11:39,230 --> 01:11:40,995
God created the universe in six days.

1171
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:45,403
And he never had a hit. Okay, he did.
He had "He's Got the Whole World in..."

1172
01:11:45,576 --> 01:11:47,068
I'm going to the party.

1173
01:11:47,245 --> 01:11:50,308
You are not going to the party.
You, young lady, are grounded.

1174
01:11:50,485 --> 01:11:52,718
You're grounded. Come back here.

1175
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:56,226
- Please. I'm a little bit desperate. Please.
- I'll see you there.

1176
01:11:56,397 --> 01:12:00,270
You won't. You won't because
you're not invited. They won't let you in.

1177
01:12:14,701 --> 01:12:16,865
- Hey, Ray.
- Alex, my man.

1178
01:12:17,039 --> 01:12:19,305
- How are you?
- I'm good, man. How you doing?

1179
01:12:19,477 --> 01:12:20,740
So is Sophie here?

1180
01:12:20,913 --> 01:12:23,509
You know what?
I haven't seen her. Yeah.

1181
01:12:23,685 --> 01:12:25,052
- Chris?
- Who?

1182
01:12:25,222 --> 01:12:27,454
- You know, my manager.
- I'm sorry. Have fun.

1183
01:12:27,626 --> 01:12:30,757
- Yeah.
- Hey, Michelle. Good to see you, babe.

1184
01:12:30,933 --> 01:12:31,924
Hey, how's it going?

1185
01:12:36,878 --> 01:12:38,745
Hey, Ray, what's up, man?

1186
01:12:39,282 --> 01:12:40,912
How's it going?

1187
01:13:06,404 --> 01:13:07,394
Hey.

1188
01:13:07,573 --> 01:13:08,905
- Where's Sophie?
- Hang on.

1189
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:13,177
Hang on. God, she's here. Please
don't let her through. Don't let her through.

1190
01:13:13,351 --> 01:13:16,117
We cannot let her talk to Cora.
She's gonna ruin everything.

1191
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:18,021
- Who?
- Sophie. She hates the song.

1192
01:13:18,194 --> 01:13:20,688
- She hates the song you wrote?
- Yes. She hates it.

1193
01:13:20,866 --> 01:13:24,066
But she wrote the song.
Why does she hate it?

1194
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:26,676
We had a little disagreement.

1195
01:13:26,845 --> 01:13:28,439
Hi there, Soph, how are you?

1196
01:13:28,615 --> 01:13:30,847
- Hey, Sophie.
- Good evening.

1197
01:13:31,019 --> 01:13:33,855
So you brought something,
did you, Sophie?

1198
01:13:34,025 --> 01:13:36,826
Yes. My mother told me,
"Never go to a party empty-handed"...

1199
01:13:36,998 --> 01:13:41,462
...so I went to the Zen Eatery and got
a selection of cookies. No, thank you.

1200
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,304
Nirvana Nougat.

1201
01:13:48,087 --> 01:13:50,251
Hey. It's my favorite writers.

1202
01:13:50,424 --> 01:13:51,757
Hi, C. How are you?

1203
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:53,921
We brought you some cookies,
from all of us.

1204
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,766
Thank you. Derek.

1205
01:13:56,938 --> 01:13:58,703
Cora, I really wanted to talk to you...

1206
01:13:58,875 --> 01:14:01,346
About the fact that
we're gonna have to leave early...

1207
01:14:01,514 --> 01:14:04,178
...to finish this song
which has become important to us...

1208
01:14:04,353 --> 01:14:06,345
...in both an artistic and spiritual sense.

1209
01:14:06,524 --> 01:14:08,756
You can't leave yet. Come see the house.

1210
01:14:08,929 --> 01:14:12,060
I wanna show you the roof. It's upstairs.

1211
01:14:12,235 --> 01:14:14,432
Do you know...? Well...

1212
01:14:17,179 --> 01:14:21,620
Cora, I definitely see how much
you've thought about the song and...

1213
01:14:21,788 --> 01:14:25,124
Great roof. In a very interesting place
as well, right at the top...

1214
01:14:25,295 --> 01:14:28,756
- Sophie was about to say something.
- Was she? I don't think she was. No.

1215
01:14:28,935 --> 01:14:31,964
She looks like she's about
to say something, then just... clams up.

1216
01:14:32,142 --> 01:14:36,549
What I wanted to say is that I appreciate
that you're bringing thought to the music...

1217
01:14:36,718 --> 01:14:40,556
...but I really and honestly feel
that we're pandering.

1218
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:46,665
Which means trying to make others like you,
which I think is a really nice thing.

1219
01:14:46,838 --> 01:14:49,537
I do a lot of it.
"Just going out pandering, be back soon."

1220
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:54,117
The song is about the struggle, you know,
to show your true feelings.

1221
01:14:54,285 --> 01:14:57,223
And your very confident sexual display...

1222
01:14:57,392 --> 01:15:01,390
...is, you know, a total contradiction
of the fear and insecurity.

1223
01:15:01,567 --> 01:15:04,733
No, I don't think so.
And my fans really love it when I dance.

1224
01:15:04,907 --> 01:15:07,207
- You're a wonderful dancer.
- That's a fair point.

1225
01:15:07,379 --> 01:15:10,749
- My last CD only went to number two.
- But in this case, if you trust us...

1226
01:15:10,919 --> 01:15:14,551
And Shakira is breathing down my neck.
So I wanna dance.

1227
01:15:16,597 --> 01:15:18,863
You shall dance.

1228
01:15:19,503 --> 01:15:23,806
But thank you for your honesty, Sophie.
Cherish your passion.

1229
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:27,850
- Well, thank you.
- Cora, Timberlake's here. Wants to say hi.

1230
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:29,919
Nice to see you, C. Talk to you later.

1231
01:15:30,091 --> 01:15:32,358
And I'm looking forward
to the new last verse.

1232
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:33,724
- Cora, wait.
- It's over.

1233
01:15:33,898 --> 01:15:36,494
It was a very nice try,
but you have hit the karmic wall.

1234
01:15:36,671 --> 01:15:40,736
With no help from you.
You just stood there. Talk about pandering.

1235
01:15:40,912 --> 01:15:43,577
I did not pander. I just told her
what she wanted to hear.

1236
01:15:43,752 --> 01:15:46,154
- I'm gonna go tell her the truth.
- You just did.

1237
01:15:46,323 --> 01:15:48,920
Are you gonna use flash cards this time?
You're stubborn.

1238
01:15:49,095 --> 01:15:52,067
And you're not stubborn enough
to stand up for what's good.

1239
01:15:52,235 --> 01:15:55,470
I mean, I just don't wanna see you
do what you did on your solo album.

1240
01:15:55,642 --> 01:15:56,974
Yes, yes, yes.

1241
01:15:58,448 --> 01:16:00,918
I bought it. The last copy.

1242
01:16:01,821 --> 01:16:04,418
All right, well, I insist
on paying you back immediately.

1243
01:16:04,593 --> 01:16:06,027
9.99, right? Do you have a penny?

1244
01:16:06,196 --> 01:16:08,860
You were trying so hard to get a hit
that it wasrt you.

1245
01:16:09,035 --> 01:16:11,130
The songs were soulless.

1246
01:16:11,307 --> 01:16:13,937
I agree. But ours has soul, so...

1247
01:16:14,112 --> 01:16:17,449
But not if we ruin it. And you know that.
Why are you so scared to care?

1248
01:16:17,618 --> 01:16:19,714
Because it won't matter.

1249
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:23,795
Because behind
all her Buddhism-in-a-thong philosophy...

1250
01:16:23,965 --> 01:16:27,233
...what she cares about
is seats filled and units sold.

1251
01:16:27,405 --> 01:16:29,068
Nothing's gonna make her your pal...

1252
01:16:29,243 --> 01:16:31,543
...any more than years with Colin
made him mine.

1253
01:16:31,714 --> 01:16:34,150
Because in the end, it's all just business.

1254
01:16:34,319 --> 01:16:36,221
- What is?
- All of it. Everything.

1255
01:16:36,389 --> 01:16:38,360
That's why they call it
the music business.

1256
01:16:38,528 --> 01:16:41,295
It's a good thing.
I wish everything in life was that clear.

1257
01:16:41,467 --> 01:16:43,937
I want something from you,
you want something from me.

1258
01:16:44,105 --> 01:16:45,630
No false promises or expectations.

1259
01:16:49,249 --> 01:16:50,717
Well.

1260
01:16:50,885 --> 01:16:53,118
Congratulations on your feel-good song.

1261
01:16:55,962 --> 01:16:57,487
Can I get you a drink?

1262
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:27,992
There's plenty of time.
We have the night, part of the morning...

1263
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:30,062
...teeniest little bit of the afternoon.

1264
01:17:59,623 --> 01:18:02,116
I can't read it.
What does that...? What does that say?

1265
01:18:02,862 --> 01:18:04,765
"Sorry, I can't do this."

1266
01:18:09,877 --> 01:18:13,817
Sorry, I can't do this

1267
01:18:15,354 --> 01:18:18,793
Not sure about the scansion.
What...? What, are you leaving?

1268
01:18:18,961 --> 01:18:23,163
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Maybe I'll think of something later.

1269
01:18:23,336 --> 01:18:26,001
There is no later.
She needs the song tomorrow.

1270
01:18:26,176 --> 01:18:29,114
If we don't give it to her,
she's gonna go to someone else.

1271
01:18:29,282 --> 01:18:30,648
I will have lost the job.

1272
01:18:30,818 --> 01:18:32,947
I'm sorry.

1273
01:18:33,757 --> 01:18:36,490
- Okay, look.
- No, I want to help. I do.

1274
01:18:36,663 --> 01:18:38,963
I wanna help you finish, but I can't.

1275
01:18:39,135 --> 01:18:43,439
I can't write when I feel like this.
I'm not inspired.

1276
01:18:43,610 --> 01:18:47,983
I don't care. I don't care if you're inspired.
Inspiratiors for amateurs.

1277
01:18:48,153 --> 01:18:51,648
I just want four lines. Please.
I just want four lines.

1278
01:18:51,826 --> 01:18:54,696
- I can't.
- Oh, but you can and you won't.

1279
01:18:54,866 --> 01:18:58,237
- Are you saying I wanted this to happen?
- I'm saying that's what you do.

1280
01:18:58,406 --> 01:19:00,740
You push and push
and move the furniture around...

1281
01:19:00,912 --> 01:19:02,609
...and talk all the time...

1282
01:19:02,781 --> 01:19:05,218
...and screw everything up
just like he said.

1283
01:19:05,688 --> 01:19:08,352
Who's he? What are you talking about?
What are you saying?

1284
01:19:08,528 --> 01:19:11,294
I read the book because I wanted
to come to you and say:

1285
01:19:11,467 --> 01:19:15,201
"You're not at all like Sally Michaels."
But actually, he's got you spot on.

1286
01:19:15,374 --> 01:19:18,939
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying Sloan Cates was right.

1287
01:19:20,017 --> 01:19:24,013
Oh, my God. Please take that back.

1288
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:27,653
The poor, innocent, helpless
"'I can't write,' she says to herself" girl...

1289
01:19:27,831 --> 01:19:29,858
...has co-authored
three-quarters of a hit...

1290
01:19:30,036 --> 01:19:33,167
...and is holding it ransom
because she can't get what she wants.

1291
01:19:33,343 --> 01:19:36,804
You think life is this fairy tale.

1292
01:19:36,984 --> 01:19:40,616
When it turns out that everything
doesn't end happily, you can't deal with it.

1293
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:07,207
Mama says I can't, Daddy says I can
But now my body just wants to slam

1294
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,005
Slam

1295
01:20:10,985 --> 01:20:14,355
- C, Alex Fletcher is here.
- Hey, Alex.

1296
01:20:14,826 --> 01:20:18,059
C, could I...? Could I have a quick word?
Thanks a lot.

1297
01:20:18,433 --> 01:20:20,836
- Derek, how are you? Good to see you.
- Alex Fletcher.

1298
01:20:23,878 --> 01:20:25,973
Yo, so how's my girl Sophie, man?

1299
01:20:26,149 --> 01:20:28,779
Yeah, no, she's keeping it pretty real.

1300
01:20:28,954 --> 01:20:30,650
Yeah, what a girl.

1301
01:20:30,824 --> 01:20:34,890
C, hi. Listen, it's about
the new last verse.

1302
01:20:35,067 --> 01:20:38,130
It's not completely formed
in the classical sense yet.

1303
01:20:38,306 --> 01:20:41,768
It's more a kind of string of words
that you can connect in almost any way.

1304
01:20:41,946 --> 01:20:44,213
- I think it's quite innovative.
- I got the lyrics.

1305
01:20:44,385 --> 01:20:48,119
Sophie faxed them over this morning.
They are so beautiful.

1306
01:20:48,292 --> 01:20:50,559
It's what I always wanted to say
to my boyfriend.

1307
01:20:50,732 --> 01:20:53,567
It's the perfect end to the song.

1308
01:20:53,938 --> 01:20:58,572
There are moments
When I don't know if it's real

1309
01:20:58,747 --> 01:21:03,587
Or if anybody feels the way I feel

1310
01:21:03,757 --> 01:21:06,820
I need inspiration

1311
01:21:07,598 --> 01:21:13,338
Not just another negotiation

1312
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:20,321
All I wanna do
Is find a way back into...

1313
01:21:21,492 --> 01:21:24,054
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Sorry, sorry.

1314
01:21:24,230 --> 01:21:27,327
I just... I just completely,
I don't know, spaced out.

1315
01:21:27,504 --> 01:21:30,236
That's okay. Let's take it from the top
with the new intro.

1316
01:21:30,410 --> 01:21:32,209
Yep. Great.

1317
01:21:34,117 --> 01:21:38,218
Yeah, Cora Corman and Alex Fletcher

1318
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:40,386
Way back into love

1319
01:21:46,041 --> 01:21:47,032
Hi.

1320
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:49,238
Hello.

1321
01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:53,856
I bought these for your children because
one should never show up empty-handed.

1322
01:21:54,425 --> 01:21:58,798
They're aliens.
Clearly, I have no children. Here.

1323
01:21:58,968 --> 01:22:01,768
- Here, let me get that for you.
- Thank you.

1324
01:22:04,912 --> 01:22:08,408
I am gonna go to the office.

1325
01:22:09,021 --> 01:22:11,788
- I am too. Have fun with those.
- Bye.

1326
01:22:18,105 --> 01:22:20,372
Put them there, thanks.

1327
01:22:22,414 --> 01:22:24,144
You coming to the concert tomorrow?

1328
01:22:24,585 --> 01:22:26,646
Can't disappoint Lucy.

1329
01:22:26,823 --> 01:22:29,020
Yes, yes, very important.

1330
01:22:29,930 --> 01:22:34,598
Chris is bringing his daughter as well,
so should be fun.

1331
01:22:34,939 --> 01:22:37,877
I just wanted to say
I thought your last verse was fantastic.

1332
01:22:38,313 --> 01:22:39,302
Thank you, Alex.

1333
01:22:40,283 --> 01:22:42,617
And I'm very sorry about what I said.

1334
01:22:42,788 --> 01:22:46,421
Well, you know, life isn't a fairy tale
and I have to grow up...

1335
01:22:46,596 --> 01:22:48,462
...and I'm gonna do that in Florida.

1336
01:22:49,133 --> 01:22:51,104
Well, that's just ridiculous.

1337
01:22:51,271 --> 01:22:54,540
No one grows up in Florida.
Unless they're an orange.

1338
01:22:54,712 --> 01:22:57,512
Well, I'm managing
the new Weight-Not branch in Boca Raton.

1339
01:22:57,684 --> 01:23:00,348
You should be writing,
not fighting cellulite.

1340
01:23:00,523 --> 01:23:03,086
Well, I can do both.
We need a new marketing campaign.

1341
01:23:03,261 --> 01:23:05,027
Swimsuit season is coming up.

1342
01:23:06,602 --> 01:23:08,196
Thing is...

1343
01:23:09,608 --> 01:23:11,703
...I can't...

1344
01:23:15,285 --> 01:23:17,586
...compose without you.

1345
01:23:17,758 --> 01:23:20,628
Thanks, but I don't think
it's a good idea.

1346
01:23:25,507 --> 01:23:27,373
All right. You're obviously very busy.

1347
01:23:32,822 --> 01:23:34,415
Good luck.

1348
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,557
You too.

1349
01:25:23,943 --> 01:25:25,606
Cora!

1350
01:25:30,089 --> 01:25:32,821
- Gracie, aren't you excited?
- Let's go.

1351
01:25:34,531 --> 01:25:38,528
You know what? You guys, just go.
I think I'm gonna skip it.

1352
01:25:38,706 --> 01:25:41,176
- No, come on. You can't skip it.
- You know what, kids?

1353
01:25:41,345 --> 01:25:43,815
I'm gonna talk to your aunt, okay?
Gary, take them in.

1354
01:25:43,983 --> 01:25:46,010
- Should I meet you...?
- Do it. How hard is it?

1355
01:25:46,187 --> 01:25:47,679
- Go, walk, sit.
- Find your seats.

1356
01:25:47,857 --> 01:25:50,795
Honey, I need a second. Thank you.
Love you. You're a good man.

1357
01:25:50,964 --> 01:25:52,159
Now, listen to me.

1358
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:56,900
Those kids have told all of their friends
that their aunt wrote Cora's new hit song.

1359
01:25:57,077 --> 01:25:59,673
And they wanna share this with you.
You gotta go in.

1360
01:25:59,848 --> 01:26:02,786
Yeah. No, I know. I know. I just...

1361
01:26:02,954 --> 01:26:06,688
I don't know how I'm gonna go in there
and look at him.

1362
01:26:07,897 --> 01:26:11,097
I know. It's just one night, though,
and I really think you need this.

1363
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:15,802
And then he'll go his way
and you'll go yours. Okay?

1364
01:26:20,423 --> 01:26:22,655
Do you have her autograph?

1365
01:26:22,827 --> 01:26:24,091
- Isn't this exciting?
- Yeah.

1366
01:26:24,697 --> 01:26:25,723
This is so cool.

1367
01:26:26,535 --> 01:26:29,405
- Yeah, weirdo. This is so cool.
- It's great.

1368
01:26:29,574 --> 01:26:31,908
We're in the Cora fan club.
Can we? Please, Mom?

1369
01:26:32,079 --> 01:26:34,778
- Okay.
- Cora!

1370
01:26:56,662 --> 01:26:58,597
Cora!

1371
01:26:58,766 --> 01:26:59,995
Cora!

1372
01:27:10,555 --> 01:27:12,219
Cora!

1373
01:27:36,841 --> 01:27:40,076
- Look, there she is!
- Is that Cora?

1374
01:27:56,615 --> 01:27:58,015
I'm starting to believe, boy

1375
01:27:59,186 --> 01:28:00,620
That this was meant to be, boy

1376
01:28:00,789 --> 01:28:03,455
'Cause I believe in karma

1377
01:28:03,628 --> 01:28:06,099
Boy, do you believe in karma?

1378
01:28:08,973 --> 01:28:12,935
Each time you put your lips to mine
It's like a taste of Buddha's delight

1379
01:28:13,114 --> 01:28:18,853
- Hey, Gary.
- Come on. I'm just watching.

1380
01:28:19,995 --> 01:28:22,990
Tell me all your fantasies tonight

1381
01:28:23,167 --> 01:28:24,760
And I will make them happen 'cause

1382
01:28:24,937 --> 01:28:29,470
I'm not satisfied if I don't get

1383
01:28:29,648 --> 01:28:32,016
My Buddha's delight

1384
01:28:32,754 --> 01:28:35,486
Om shanti, shanti

1385
01:28:37,596 --> 01:28:43,097
This Tuesday on The CW,
it's Battle of the '80s Has-Beens...

1386
01:28:43,274 --> 01:28:46,508
...featuring Tiffany battling
reigning champion Debbie Gibson...

1387
01:28:46,681 --> 01:28:49,346
...followed by a bout
between Adam Ant and Billy Idol.

1388
01:28:50,723 --> 01:28:53,091
Tuesday night on The CW.

1389
01:28:54,497 --> 01:28:56,831
Five minutes, Mr. Fletcher.

1390
01:28:59,473 --> 01:29:04,073
Entering Bootytown
So shake my booty now

1391
01:29:04,249 --> 01:29:09,851
'Cause your booty
Is the way into his heart

1392
01:29:24,189 --> 01:29:26,352
New York, I love you!

1393
01:29:28,598 --> 01:29:29,862
Shanti, shanti.

1394
01:29:30,034 --> 01:29:31,229
What's that mean?

1395
01:29:31,404 --> 01:29:34,342
And now I'd like you to hear
something very special.

1396
01:29:34,510 --> 01:29:37,539
- Oh, Soph.
- Something very different.

1397
01:29:37,716 --> 01:29:39,185
It's a new song.

1398
01:29:39,353 --> 01:29:41,346
This is it, weirdo, your song.

1399
01:29:42,593 --> 01:29:45,996
- I don't think I can listen to this.
- A song no one has heard before...

1400
01:29:46,167 --> 01:29:49,799
...written by Mr. Alex Fletcher.

1401
01:29:49,974 --> 01:29:50,964
Wait.

1402
01:29:56,988 --> 01:30:00,119
What? Alex Fletcher and my sister.

1403
01:30:00,295 --> 01:30:01,695
How quickly they forget.

1404
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:05,736
Let's just go and come back
when the song's over. You and me.

1405
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:09,842
- Actually, I'm gonna go.
- No. What?

1406
01:30:10,013 --> 01:30:12,041
- Yeah, no. I'm fine. Just...
- Are you sure?

1407
01:30:12,219 --> 01:30:15,454
Yeah, I'm fine. I just wanna be alone.
Just take care of the kids.

1408
01:30:36,568 --> 01:30:39,300
It's never been easy for me

1409
01:30:41,110 --> 01:30:44,845
To find words to go along with a melody

1410
01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:52,363
But this time there's actually
Something on my mind

1411
01:30:54,403 --> 01:30:59,004
So please forgive
These few brief awkward lines

1412
01:31:01,182 --> 01:31:05,180
Since I met you
My whole life has changed

1413
01:31:07,596 --> 01:31:12,129
It's not just my furniture
You've rearranged

1414
01:31:14,309 --> 01:31:20,014
I was living in the past
But somehow you've brought me back

1415
01:31:20,521 --> 01:31:26,021
And I haven't felt like this
Since before Frankie said, "Relax"

1416
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:28,693
And though I know

1417
01:31:28,871 --> 01:31:31,843
Based on my track record

1418
01:31:32,011 --> 01:31:35,006
I might not seem like the safest bet

1419
01:31:38,457 --> 01:31:40,723
All I'm asking you

1420
01:31:41,296 --> 01:31:45,202
Is don't write me off just yet

1421
01:31:56,727 --> 01:32:00,725
For years I've been telling myself
The same old story

1422
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:07,506
That I'm happy to live off
My so-called former glories

1423
01:32:09,386 --> 01:32:15,331
But you've given me a reason
To take another chance

1424
01:32:15,833 --> 01:32:21,299
Now I need you despite the fact
That you've killed all my plants

1425
01:32:21,644 --> 01:32:23,704
And though I know

1426
01:32:23,881 --> 01:32:26,911
I've already blown more chances

1427
01:32:27,088 --> 01:32:30,117
Than anyone should ever get

1428
01:32:34,034 --> 01:32:36,528
All I'm asking you

1429
01:32:36,708 --> 01:32:40,477
Is don't write me off just yet

1430
01:32:43,754 --> 01:32:48,321
Don't write me off just yet

1431
01:33:05,932 --> 01:33:07,561
Alex!

1432
01:33:29,613 --> 01:33:32,175
- Nobody backstage.
- I have to get up there. I know Cora.

1433
01:33:32,352 --> 01:33:35,152
- I don't care what you want.
- I know Cora. I wrote this song.

1434
01:33:35,324 --> 01:33:36,314
She's okay.

1435
01:33:36,493 --> 01:33:38,929
- There's nobody backstage.
- I said she's okay, right?

1436
01:33:39,099 --> 01:33:41,091
- Well, you vouch for her, then.
- Thank you.

1437
01:33:41,270 --> 01:33:42,363
What's wrong with you?

1438
01:33:42,538 --> 01:33:45,066
As soon as Cora's done "Slam,"
we'll need you on-stage.

1439
01:33:45,244 --> 01:33:47,680
Okay, got it. Got it.
Thanks very much. Cheers.

1440
01:33:49,318 --> 01:33:51,346
Slam

1441
01:33:51,958 --> 01:33:57,367
Mama says I can't, Daddy says I can
But now my body just wants to slam

1442
01:33:58,671 --> 01:33:59,832
Slam

1443
01:34:01,777 --> 01:34:03,644
Come to a concert, don't bring anything?

1444
01:34:04,716 --> 01:34:07,312
Alex, that song.

1445
01:34:07,487 --> 01:34:10,756
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
It's the best I could do. You could fix it.

1446
01:34:10,928 --> 01:34:14,025
No. That song was dinner.

1447
01:34:17,508 --> 01:34:19,774
Mama says I can't, Daddy says I can

1448
01:34:23,286 --> 01:34:24,414
Thank you!

1449
01:34:27,963 --> 01:34:31,026
I want you to hear my new single.

1450
01:34:31,870 --> 01:34:33,601
Thank you!

1451
01:34:33,774 --> 01:34:38,546
"Way Back Into Love," music and lyrics
by Sophie Fisher and Alex Fletcher.

1452
01:34:38,717 --> 01:34:41,187
What happened to steamy and sticky?

1453
01:34:41,356 --> 01:34:44,385
I explained to Cora that it violated
the very core of the lyric...

1454
01:34:44,562 --> 01:34:46,428
...and corrupted the purity of the song.

1455
01:34:46,599 --> 01:34:49,537
When that didn't work, I told her
it would help me win you back.

1456
01:34:49,706 --> 01:34:50,969
And that did it.

1457
01:34:51,143 --> 01:34:55,480
Turns out that although she thought
the Dalai Lama was, incredibly, a llama...

1458
01:34:55,651 --> 01:34:57,848
...she is, in fact, quite the romantic.

1459
01:34:58,589 --> 01:35:00,492
- Go. Go. Go.
- Okay, Mr. Fletcher.

1460
01:35:00,661 --> 01:35:02,129
Thank you.

1461
01:35:02,297 --> 01:35:07,501
Trapped in the past
I just can't seem to move on

1462
01:35:07,675 --> 01:35:12,208
I've been hiding all my hopes
And dreams away

1463
01:35:12,385 --> 01:35:17,190
Just in case I ever need 'em
Again someday

1464
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:20,355
I've been setting aside time

1465
01:35:21,369 --> 01:35:26,505
To clear a little space
In the corners of my mind

1466
01:35:27,515 --> 01:35:33,517
All I wanna do
Is find a way back into love

1467
01:35:37,201 --> 01:35:44,170
I can't make it through
Without a way back into love

1468
01:35:50,861 --> 01:35:55,359
I've been watching
But the stars refuse to shine

1469
01:35:55,537 --> 01:36:00,378
I've been searching
But I just don't see the signs

1470
01:36:00,548 --> 01:36:04,283
I know that it's out there

1471
01:36:04,454 --> 01:36:09,727
There's gotta be something
For my soul somewhere

1472
01:36:09,899 --> 01:36:14,101
I've been looking for someone
To shed some light

1473
01:36:14,274 --> 01:36:18,579
Not somebody just to get me
Through the night

1474
01:36:18,951 --> 01:36:21,980
I could use some direction

1475
01:36:23,794 --> 01:36:27,894
And I'm open to your suggestions

1476
01:36:28,770 --> 01:36:35,443
All I wanna do
Is find a way back into love

1477
01:36:38,155 --> 01:36:44,692
I can't make it through
Without a way back into love

1478
01:36:45,804 --> 01:36:50,177
And if I open my heart to you

1479
01:36:50,346 --> 01:36:54,754
I'm hoping you'll show me what to do

1480
01:36:54,922 --> 01:36:59,090
And if you help me to start again

1481
01:37:00,199 --> 01:37:07,113
You know that I'll be there
For you in the end

1482
01:40:09,222 --> 01:40:18,231
THE END
