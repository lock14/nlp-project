In the cemetery|it was scary
Shit ain't necessary, I'm gonna|let you niggas, here we go
I'm very deadly,|I bust a nigga's head on top
Body don't drop,|call a cop
Nigga know Little E,|you know I got it locked
Too hot,|don't stop...
Most of us don't see|this on the news anymore.
We have reality TV instead--
''Joe Millionaire,''|''Survivor.''
Well, survive this--
a year in Baghdad|without changing the channel.
Hit it, uh uh,|2003, uh
Hit it, uh uh,|2003, uh
They got us out here|in Baghdad, life is hard
Got us pullin'|fuckin' two hours ago
Got us pullin'|fuckin' two hours ago
And then they up it up|to 8 between 1 2
I don't give a fuck,|I think I'm stuck in hell, uh
I'd rather be there|instead of jail...
Joint Chiefs Chairman|General Richard Myers
has just returned from Iraq.|He praised US forces,
saying morale is high
and troops are committed|to getting the job done.
They understand why|they're in Iraq.
And they understand|the greater mission...
Move that piece|of shit, Commo.
...the war in Iraq|is just one part.
It's particularly|interesting to note
how well our forces are able|to switch from tracking down
the violent former Baath|regime's fellow men
to assisting Iraqis|in rebuilding their country.
But the soldiers understand|their mission,
and they accept|their conditions,
and they accept|their conditions,
and we're working on the quality|of life to make it better.
Welcome to Gunner Palace.
This palace was built|after the first Gulf War
This palace was built|after the first Gulf War
for Saddam Hussein's|first wife.
Later it was given|to his son Uday,
who used it quite often
to have his wild parties.
We dropped a bomb on it,|and now we party in it.
This building was damaged|during the war.
This here was like|an open ballroom-type area.
Over here, you can see|where the staircase is going.
The staircase is still|pretty much safe to use.
You can get a good view.
We live from Baghdad,|man, it's so sad...
From inside of...
the good portion
of the building|to the, uh...
This is our party site|right here.
You can see|where I'm putting in--
I've got a driver's range|for golf.
For people who like|to play golf, I'm putting in
three putting greens.
You can't--|you can't put that--
This is just speculation.
This is just speculation.
We heard before|we moved in there
this is one of Uday's|weekend party palaces.
As you look around here,
you can see it was certainly set up|for that, a little paradise.
It's got a stocked|fishing pond.
It has a lot of these|little enclave buildings
It has a lot of these|little enclave buildings
that are the most impractically set up|that you could ever imagine.
You gotta wonder who he was|trying to impress.
If you look around,
you've got the circular bed|in the back.
The gaudy furniture.
So, yes, we do know|this was Uday's palace.
Everybody said so. The locals said so.|The leaders said so.
They've said they never had|an opportunity to be in here.
I think they've already got two down.
Okay, sounds good.|I'll get with you a little later.
The particular area|of Adhamiya
that I think that|we've seen--
it's been so contentious--
has been the Abu Hanifa|area in particular.
There's other areas|as well,
but that one's the one that|appears to be the hotbed
or the center of gravity|for Baath party meetings.
You probably remember|seeing Saddam Hussein--
it was the last time,|as a matter of fact,
that he was seen publicly|lifted up on shoulders
in a particular|market square.
Well, that's the Abu Hanifa|market square.
Hey, you're too close.
We've got a couple|of wannabe movie stars.
These guys were trained|to stop a Russian advance,
artillery,|the guns of Giessen.
They live to blow stuff up.
But out here|in the streets of Baghdad,
they become policemen,|social workers and politicians.
Today, truant officers.|Two Humvees
and a squad of heavily|armed soldiers
to take a glue-sniffing kid|off the street.
He's not hurting anywhere.|He's just all fucked up.
Come on, get up there.|Come on.
This kid's been causing|multiple problems.
We picked him up|four or five times.
Everything|from basic shoplifting
to breaking and entering,|burglary.
Just an orphaned kid.|He's on drugs.
One of them heartbreaker stories.
Nothing really you can do
but try to get him|into some kind of assistance.
This is an AFRTS|news minute.
Children cheered on|US soldiers
as classes started|at two schools
in Abu Ghraib City, Iraq.
Officials say|the schools were gutted
and had been used to store|weapons and ammunition.
But with hard work and cooperation|from the local people,
the troops were able|to repair the damage.
Come here.
A lot of these guys|are fresh out of high school.
They come from towns that read like|an atlas of a forgotten America--
Pine Bluff,|Chesterton, Argyle.
The area I come from|is very small.
There's not much to it.
Not a lot of opportunities|for people fresh out of high school.
So it was either community|college or go do something.
Travel the world,|get paid for it.
Experience places|like this.
There's nothing else like it.|Nothing else like it.
I talked to just some friends|I have back home,
and their just perception|of this is totally different.
They just say to me,
''Oh, you get to go out shopping|and stuff like that, right?''
It's like, ''No no no.|It's much different than that.''
You try to explain
the streets and the way|these people have to live.
And they can't grip it.|They can't grip it.
I don't think anybody can.
It looks normal,
but the soldiers sense|something that I can't see.
Yeah, see...
They really don't like|Americans back here.
What's up?
This is an AFRTS|news minute.
This is an AFRTS|news minute.
US troops mobilized|during recent deployments
to Iraq and Afghanistan
will not have to worry about|their student loan obligations
while fighting overseas.
The President has|signed into law
the Higher Education Relief|Opportunities for Students...
of 2003.
That extends for another|two years benefits--
That extends for another|two years benefits--
They're trying|to hit the camp.
Is someone smoking|a cigarette in the shitters?
- Where is it?|- It's in the box, dude.
It's in the fucking box?
Dude, he was in my bag.
That's who bagged|your crackers.
That's who ate|my freakin' crackers.
This is my new room--
an old guardhouse|in Gate 2.
A few minutes ago
six mortars impacted|a few hundred meters away,
tossing up dirt
and doing little damage.
But the only enemy|they see here is the rat.
Never mind the explosions,|get the rat.
Let me tell you how we kill|a rat in Indiana.
Good.
I'll help you kill one|of them things.
I have 10 roommates.
Wilf, the youngest, is 19.
He joined the Army at 17.|He hails from Colorado,
just down the road|from Columbine and South Park.
Wilf is what they call|the new Army,
the Army of One.
I'm PFC Stuart Wilf, and you have|my permission to record this.
This is my shirt,
and that's my|desktop background.
The lovely sights.
Happy people.
The flag.
I've got a gun.
Yes.
Once,|not on purpose.
But no one was hurt.|It was all right.
Once at a building.
Yes.
Possibly.
You never know.
Stranger things|have happened.
Very well|could have been.
And if there was|someone in there,
well, they weren't happy.|I can tell you that.
Every time I walk|the streets
I keep the eye|on the foes
Got slugs that'll fuck you|in your dreams and goals
Only roll with real thugs,|and y'all niggas is pussy
Got custom-made coffins|for the faggot that pushed me
Got custom-made coffins|for the faggot that pushed me
Fake niggas don't even tempt me,|false move and you're dead
Someone pushed the fuckin' brains|out of the back of your head
Fuck around and change my mind|and get your family instead
Run up in your crib and murder you|while you sleepin' in bed.
Hey. Hey, mister.
What?
Back up.
Go on, back up.
Captain Garcia spotted|a suspicious-Iooking bag
up the road|on the meridian.
It could be an improvised|explosive device
or IED|as they're called.
IEDs are every soldier's|worst fear.
They're in bags, pots,|garbage piles, trees
and sometimes even molded|into concrete curbs.
Nobody wants to get near|this thing, whatever it is.
Least of all, me.
It's empty.
We stopped traffic in both|directions for 15 minutes
for an empty plastic bag,|and the Iraqis are laughing at us.
That was a really suspiciously|placed bag of trash.
It's true.
No, I'm not scared because I believe|in what I am doing,
but I'm rather careful.
Yeah, so there's something different|between ''to be careful''
and ''to be scared of.''
If I was scared completely,
I would have left|at my own job.
But I'm trying to be careful|because I got my parents waiting
for me to back safe|and sound home.
And you know, God is basically|watching over me,
and He's the best protector|and preserver.
I'm not trying to give|an ideal picture
about the American people.|They are just human beings.
They make mistakes|and make good things
like me|and any other one,
but American people
are getting friendly
with anyone, easily.
They don't have barriers.
If you sit with somebody|for 10 minutes,
he's gonna narrate his whole|life story for you.
And this certainly rare to be found|in somebody else.
Here we go.|We're in the middle of Baghdad.
Here we go.|We're in the middle of Baghdad.
We're doing another plug|for Snapple Pink Lemonade.
When I retire, I want Snapple|for the rest of my life.
Yeah, man, I've always dreamed|of this my whole life.
When I was a kid, I always|wanted to be the first one
to go to strange|faraway places,
meet new people,
be the first kid on my block|with a confirmed kill
and drink Snapple|in Uday's old swimming pool.
I usually drink other things|in the swimming pool.
They won't let us drink beer|and alcohol and stuff like that.
Snapple's pretty good.
Mike Tyson.
The guy with the do-rag|on his head is Mohammed Tyson.
The guy with the blindfold|is Tyson's prisoner.
Mohammed, Mustafa and Roy|are Charlie Battery's interpreters.
The prisoner|is a known assassin,
hired to kill Iraqis who are|cooperating with the coalition.
Mohammed and Roy saw the assassin|driving down the street today
on his motorcycle.
So they jumped out|of the bushes and tackled him.
We suppose that you arrest|the most important person.
I talk to him,|by the way, for an hour
before I come here.
He has a very strong|personality,
a well confidence|in himself,
and he knows|what he's doing
and what he's speaking.
Even I've told him|several times
that he's going to be|in jail, so confess,
tell everything that you know.|He said, ''I don't mind.
I can go to jail.|I don't care about it.''
Let them pack the nice gats|with the hollow tips in 'em
Bodies look like polka-dots|from the hole I put in 'em
Me and my thug niggas|specialize in splitting those wigs
Gotta a killer squad that's thorough,|into toys like Flynt
Our crew will be big
I told your act|he's fucking with thugs
Mr. Crief is so quick to put a slug|in your mug, fake-ass bitch.
Basil!
Basil is the coolest Iraqi|I've ever met.
We both like having|a good time.
- Yes.|- We're both pretty positive, I think.
Oh, yeah.|Not each other.
He might wanna fuck me,|but, uh... no.
Secretary Rumsfeld|said terrorists
Secretary Rumsfeld|said terrorists
are starting to realize|things are changing
in favor|of the Iraqi people.
They see the Iraqi Governing Council|getting on its feet.
I think he's pissed at that guy.|The guy across the table
from him is saying it's the mosque that's|doing this to the coalition.
That's what pissed|this guy off.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Please. Remember,|we had this talk about acting civilly?
Two months ago--|two months ago--
you guys--|gentlemen, please!
About two months ago,|we talked about acting civilly.
You've come so far,|so fast.
Please let's not digress. I'm sure|we can get the same discussion done
without screaming|across the table.
Now is the issue that we have|one of our council members
that's not showing up
because he's|been threatened?
Yes.
Could one of you,|when we break, come to me
with as much information|that you have
on who's threatening him|and when and where,
and I'll do what I can?
Certainly, if we haven't|armed him yet,
we're at the position|where we need to go ahead
and give him a weapons card|and a weapon.
You have glasses on?|You have some sort of eye protection?
You have glasses on?|You have some sort of eye protection?
There you go.|Is it on ''safe'' now?
You couldn't shoot it|because it's on ''safe.''
So you want to|push it over.
There you go.|Okay, good.
And make sure|you aim nice and low
into the sandbags.|Into the sandbags.
The sandbags.
- Okay, aim into the sandbags.|- Okay.
Into the bags. You know|what I'm talking about?
Yeah.|Not high, low.
Into the--
- There you go. That's good.|- I'm afraid you are--
No, that's good.|You're good.
You're good,|but aim into the bags.
- Okay, that's good.|- Good?
You're good. You feel|comfortable with it?
There you go. Now let's see where|to squeeze the trigger.
Now take it off|the safety.
See? That's it.|You got it. You good?
You look nervous.|Are you okay?
All right.
From the AFRTS|news center in Washington,
this is|the ''Two-Minute Report.''
this is|the ''Two-Minute Report.''
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld|Wednesday urged Congress
to pass the President's $87 billion|supplemental budget request
for Iraq and Afghanistan.
Mr. Rumsfeld said most|of the money
will go to support US troops,
who he said,|''Need it and need it soon.''
Smoking weed,|can't smoke in the army
Smoking weed,|can't smoke in the army
Nigga trying to harm me,|bomb me, don't give a fuck
Vietnam--|putting it down
Coming down, North Carolina|funky sound
Get down from the C-Town,|buck, shit
Come down, tuck it down|with my tight grip
20'' rims on the side
Diamonds|in my teeth, look.
Do you know|where the mother is?
Do you know|where the mother is?
I'm sorry?|They found her in the street?
Yes.
Where's the mommy?|Oh, she's crying.
Look at her features.|They're so formed.
She just look like a little,|like a little...
My wife gave birth|to our first son June 30
while I was out here, so...
- Boy or a girl?|- Little boy.
I've seen pictures,|but I haven't gotten to hold him yet.
This is SpongeBob SquarePants.
He's very popular back|in the United States.
One of my heroes.
Today what we're doing
Today what we're doing
is we got a recent tip
of counterintelligence that|we have number 89 on the blacklist,
an elderly gentlemen,|Basil Osan Hussein al-Habib,
about 60 years old.
So we expect|a soft compliant entry.
It won't be|a difficult raid to do.
The particular individual|in question, number 89,
was the former Director General|for Chemical Weapons Development
for the Ministry of Defense,|so he's of some value to us,
mainly for questioning,|and we'll pass him on
and send him back to BiOp.
It's a quiet night.
Two coming in!
How you doing, sir?
Good good. It's always good|to get your man, isn't it?
Roger that, sir.
- Has he been quiet?|- Yeah, he's pretty cooperative, sir.
- He speaks pretty good English, too.|- Okay, where's his wife?
Sir, his wife is here.|We didn't wake his kids up.
His kids are still sleeping. I told them|just to lay down. It wasn't a big thing.
Okay, good good.|Wife doing all right?
Roger, sir.
He's diabetic.
Medics has the medicine.
We have all the medicine|we need for him, okay? We're good.
You have all your medicine|you need, right?
- Yes, we got it.|- Okay.
It's okay.
- Ma'am.|- Osan.
Hey, LT.
There's an IED up ahead.
There's an IED up ahead!
I'm out of here, like 2000.
Alaska, Hawaii, Texas,
Oklahoma, Louisiana, all parts|in-between. You know what I'm saying?
These flies over here|are awful.
The good news is you|got your back to it.
You won't see|what's coming.
''Hey, gimme 18 Whoppers.''|He's like, ''What?''
''Hey, gimme 18 Whoppers.''|He's like, ''What?''
I was like, ''18 Whoppers.'' He's like,|''No one ever orders this big.''
I was like, ''I do.|Gimme my Whoppers.''
He reaches over and grabs|a Coke and just goes--
Food is good.|I love Burger King.
I love McDonald's.|I love all these guys.
Food.
Food is good.
All right, all right.
Hey, what's going on?
Whoo!
Maybe it's all just burned|into my mind now.
I'm just imagining|all of it.
Who knows?
We'll keep one SAW|back here.
We'll keep one SAW|back here.
Just know where|your people are.
We got the rear, so you start|holding 'em like you fucking mean it.
Right now it's not 20 guys|with armed weapons anymore.
They said it's four,|and they might be across the river.
So just keep that in mind,|keep your eyes open,
because if it's anything|like last night,
it's gonna be ugly,|gentlemen.
When we first got here,|they were waving at us.
And next minute,|soon as we drive by,
we'd get shot at.
Or some days they'd|look at us mean
and give us gestures|that they didn't want us there.
You know, you just get|the feeling that these guys,
they don't care|too much about you,
so they will take|your life.
If they don't have any direct|family members in the military,
then it's just|entertainment for them.
This is just|entertainment for them.
A lot of people|watch the war
because it was almost 24/7|action footage,
better than any movie,|better than any sitcom.
This is real life drama|right here.
But soon as the coverage|stopped when the war was over,
there was no entertainment|anymore
unless you have some|live footage
of someone getting shot|in the street
or something like that.|No one cares.
Hey, it's clear.
Hey, it's clear.
- Cleared.|- Don't fucking do it!
Don't fight me,|motherfucker!
He was going for this one.
I punched him in his|fucking face.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, there's his glasses|right there.
Intelligence says that hard-core|bomb builders are in this house.
They're looking|for a few brothers.
So I'm working.
I'm working, too.
I don't know|what it's for.
I'm from...|Medical Technology.
Keep your mouth shut.
It's okay.|It's okay.
You keep|your mouth shut.
Hey, yeah.|Be quiet, all right?
Be quiet!
Just shut your mouth.
Hey, shut up!
Pick him up.|He goes outside the wall.
- This one?|- No, the reporter right here.
The reporter guy|likes to talk.
He goes outside the wall.
Just like that.|''Shut him up.''
Yeah.
No evidence of bomb building|was found in the house.
All of the brothers|were detained
and transferred|to Abu Ghraib Prison.
Before we went on the patrol,|we all had a gut feeling
that something|was gonna happen.
When that explosion took off,|it was just a bright light,
and I looked closer,
and I saw the casualties|laying on the ground.
As I went up, I saw|the soldier lying there
on the ground moving,
so I knew she was all right|and talking.
But then I noticed|her left eye
maybe had shrapnel in it.
So we went ahead and put|a patch on her eye.
That's when we started|hearing gunfire.
And then the MPs just lit up|the rooftops behind us.
At that point,|I was grabbing my weapon,
plus staying|over the patient,
'cause she didn't have|her Kevlar on at the time.
As soon as|the gunfire was over
and we found out everyone|was all right,
no one got hit,
then we proceeded to get|everyone in their vehicles.
We didn't get maybe|50 meters from that area,
and the second one|went off.

Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs|General Peter Pace
says the military is|working quickly to make sure
all service members
have access to body armor|with the latest technology.
General Pace and Defense Secretary|Donald Rumsfeld--
Six hours later,|an IED meant for a Humvee
destroyed two civilian buses.
Dozens were killed|and wounded.
When you look at the ground,|you can't really see the blood
'cause the road is, like, black,
so it just looks like water|on the ground, right?
And the bus?|Oh God.
I ain't want to look|at the bus no more.
The Humvee|got messed up bad.
Our guys are still safe.|Our guys are still good,
so thank the Lord for that,|for our sake.
Just one more day|in Baghdad.
Yo yo yo yo
Hey, yo, sometimes|I just stand in the zone
Contemplating and praying|to God
That I get a chance|to go home
Did you ever get to lay|in the prone
Receiving enemy fire while slugs|barely missing your dome?
Yo, I noticed that my face|is really aging so quickly
'Cause I've seen more|than your average man in his 50s
I'm 24 here,|I got two kids and a wife
Having visions of them,|picturing me up out of their life
This is real life, homey,|and it's just so deep
And it's so deep when you|go through long weeks with no sleep
IEDs be going off|while we out on patrol
Scrap metal be ripping through|your fucking skin and your bones
Got a soldier now, and he's|trying to put up a fight
But you really knowing he's taking|the last breaths of his life.
That's for you, baby.
This is an AFRTS|news minute.

The Department of Defense
says a new initiative|called Horizontal Fusion
will make it easier for war|fighters to do their jobs.
Horizontal Fusion is a system|that enables service members
Horizontal Fusion is a system|that enables service members

It's Thursday night,|wedding night.
It's normal to hear shots|out here.
People are just celebrating.|Wedding parties.
Drummond, calm down.|It's wedding day.
They always shoot up|in the air on wedding day.
Calm down!|It's all right.
I'm already ready.
It's turning out to be|more than a normal Thursday.
Downtown by the mosque,
a large group|of pro-Saddam demonstrators
is trying|to incite a riot.
Rocks are being thrown. There are|reports of weapons in the crowd.
Gunships, M1 tanks|and Bradley fighting vehicles
are circling the area,
hoping to diffuse the situation|without bloodshed.
So you went to|the damn riot, a Baathist riot,
and you got a damn|T-shirt out of it. Outstanding!
I even got a headband, sir.
That's a handsome-Iooking|devil, too, isn't he?
- Got the headband, too.|- Too bad he's scared as shit
and dresses up like women now.
Did you know that?
He hides in women's clothing|so he doesn't get caught anymore.
Yeah.
I wonder if he wears|panties, too.
So what is it|that you do here?
So what is it|that you do here?
People come to the gate
and they say they have|all this kind of...
I got information|on such and such,
like terrorist activity,|attacks on the compound,
weapons of mass destruction,|da-da-da-da-da.
I sit here|with an interpreter
and figure out if they're|telling the truth or not.
At first, I took everything|and wrote it down
'cause I didn't know.
After a few months,|you start to weed out the liars
from the drunks from the people|who are semi sort of telling the truth
but just don't know|where the hell it is.
It's not too bad.
One time I took|these pictures of these guys
while they were blindfolded
and put all this|information down.
I sat there|with my interpreter,
I showed them the pictures|and I was like, ''Is this you?''
And they're like,|''Yeah yeah.''
Then I'd flip it over to the English,|'cause they couldn't read it.
I said, ''This shit here tells me|that you're Fedayeen terrorists,
and your whole family|is Fedayeen terrorists.
You'd better start cooperating,|or you're gonna see Cuba real soon.''
And then they started crying.
I mean, I'm talking guys like 6'2'',
probably about 205 Ibs.|of pure muscle.
''Oh, gosh,|don't send me there.''
You know?
The colonel was with us.
He stayed on the median|and you know,
just coordinated|over the radio with ready 6,
and Captain K ran everything|that went on, like usual.
And Bravo was out there.
Holy fucking shit!
I'm gonna fucking kill|all of you.
What the hell was that?
Pentagon officials said Tuesday|coalition forces
are making steady|and remarkable progress
towards stability in Iraq.
Defense Secretary|Donald Rumsfeld said,
''Since the death of Uday|and Qusay Hussein,
more Iraqis|are coming forward
with useful information
and that has led|to scores of raids.''
Yo yo yo yo
Yo yo yo yo
Yo, it's Baghdad, Iraq
And I'm patrolling|the streets
I got two Humvees|and my M16
My whole team is on the brink,|so we ready to go
It's combat, Commo,|niggas running the show.
Adhamiya has been on edge|for the last week.
Rumors of demonstrations,|Saddam sightings,
reports of armed men|near the mosque.
The response is a Psy-Op.
The whole unit is out|on the streets today,
passing out bumper stickers
and talking to people.
Well, we want 'em|to understand that
we're here to help them.|We don't want to change his mind.
We don't want him to hate|Saddam Hussein or anything.
If he likes him,|he likes him.
But I want him to understand|that he's out of power now,
and we want to help them.|We really do.
No good.
- Sex with Saddam?|- Yes.
Two lines, two words...
Saddam is hero.
Chocolate. America.
Good America.
America good, America.
America good, America.
Mister, mister.
Don't fuck with me, jokers,|I will break you off proper

But I'll pick the fight,|baby, going out in a blaze.
The G group right now,
The G group right now,
there's not a whole lot|of counterintelligence on them.
We do know that|it's some shady business.
They've been dealing|with weapons trafficking.
It's a very tight clan.
They will do anything|to protect Sheik Majid,
although he himself|doesn't pose much of a threat
being about a 60-year-old man.|Very well connected.
Even the children in here|give early warning
as to troop movement|in the sector.
That's why we chose|to go in when we did.
- What's our total count?|- 1 2.
- Is that with Mike?|- Yeah.
We roll out,|no getting our gear
I'm gonna let your boys know we don't|have no fear, your heart is racing
pacing 'cause you're about to go through|this mission
Everybody, pay a-fucking-ttention,|we about to start lynching
We about to gather up, now, niggas,|here we go, pull bodies off in cuffs
We don't give a fuck|when it's time to get there
We boys don't really know,|we really don't care.
Go! Go!
This is not a drill,|in the battlefield
In Iraq, yo,|this shit's fucking real
Yo, it's getting deep,|it's getting fucking grimy
On raids every night,|got the crew behind me
Four men run in your house,|clear the room, boom
Over here! Over here!
Get down, get down!|Down down!
Get down!
Hold on, hold on!
- Get down! Get down!|- Get down! Get down!
- Down!|- Get down!
- Get down!|- Down, get down!
Go to the right.|Where's team two?
Come in, come in!
Come on,|come on, come on!
Get me security.
Security! Security!
Go go go go go!
Go!
- Come come come.|- Come come come.
Come come.
Come on, come on.
- Is it clear?|- Clear.
Coming in!|Friendlies coming in!
Friendlies coming in!
You can start with the females.
The sheik is out.
Gone to Fallujah, they say.
Don't know when he'll be back.
We went to breach the gate,
and we hit it with the Humvee.
We continued to come in.|The car was right in front of the door.
The car breached the door for us,|so we were able to go right in.
Worked out pretty well.
Yo yo, out|of your house, oh
Flexi-cuffed and shit
You in the detainee pit|starting to shit, yo
Steady crying,|getting arrested
Trying to pray to Allah|'cause he didn't bless you
You did the wrong thing|going against 2/3
Yo, I represent HHB
We the raid masters, yo
We got the shit that got|the gun blasters, yo
50 cal blowing|your brain, oh
I've been to the lead,|and I'm going insane
It's all about this shit|right here, the sandbox
Yo, blow Haji right out|of his fucking socks.
The total haul was $48,000|in Iraqi dinar,
a couple of weapons|and some ledger books.
Sheik Majid stopped|by the palace a few days later.
He was arrested then released.
Later that week,
the sheik stopped by with|a home-cooked meal for the colonel
as if nothing had happened|and they were old friends.
Welcome to Gunnerpalooza 4.|I'm Gunner 6.
Welcome to Gunner Palace.
Anybody new that|hasn't been here before?
This is all our guys here?
We got one guy?
That's right. Gunner Palace,|basically an adult paradise,
all for you.
For awhile, I couldn't sleep|for awhile.
It was the first time|I ever had to kill somebody.
So I know for me--
you know, it tore me up|pretty bad.
But after awhile,|I learned to deal with it
because if I look at it|as, you know,
it's either gonna be him|or it's gonna be me,
I know I'm not doing|the wrong thing.
I'm just following orders,|so I'd rather it not be me.
So I had to, you know,
I learned|to live with it.
I live in a place where|the streetlights never come on
I live in a place where|the streetlights never come on
And every time|you step outside
It's like you're hearing|a sad song, yo
Every day I been praying|for my life
I got a little boy, I'm just trying|to make it home to my wife
Not trying to be a victim|of the IED
The streets|is full of trash
Trying to watch|where I place my feet.
All right, it's open.
We've got a breach|on the second door.
Where's my weapon at?
- Go go go!|- Go go!
- You ready?|- Yup.
- It's empty.|- It's empty?
- Yes.|- Good, that makes it easy.
You weren't gone very long.
You weren't gone very long.
I don't feel like I'm defending|my country anymore,
I don't feel like I'm defending|my country anymore,
and that kinda sucks.
That's the whole purpose|when you're a kid to join the Army.
You want to be able to feel like,|you know, defend your country,
but we're not defending|our country anymore.
I know we haven't defended|our country in a while.
But you know...
it's like-- I don't know.
I am 'cause nothing beats it.
Nothing beats it, you know?
We all talk about|when we're gonna go home,
how proud we're gonna be|to be combat vets.
How many people can say|they're combat veterans?
You know, 19 years old,|I fought in a war.
During Friday prayer,
During Friday prayer,
Lieutenant Colgan|and a squad from Survey
come down to the mosque|to monitor what the imam is saying.
Some weeks he condemns|the coalition.
But this week, he's calling for calm|after the demonstrations.
The kids are really funny
'cause at first, they'll be|like, ''Mister, mister,''
and then they'll realize,|''Oh, misses, misses.''
And then they want|to talk to you even more.
You get swarms of kids|right in front of you.
You're trying|to be friendly to 'em,
while looking around,
making sure no one's|gonna shoot you.
But the guys|are even funnier.
You have 'em walk by you,|and then you see 'em.
Their heads still turn
and they about trip over|themselves trying to walk.
And then you have|some people just looking
and about crash their cars.
I don't think they've ever|seen a woman in uniform.
Some days it feels|almost normal here.
Lieutenant Colgan and his team|talk to the neighbors.
People wave|as they drive past.
It's how you hope|it would be-- peaceful.
Sam, you are not looking.
Sam, you are not looking.
Sam, don't make me|hold you at gunpoint.
After you establish|eye contact, right?
Go into your mac mode.
Then give her the what's up nod.|Like, what's up?
If she reply back with that,|then you move towards her
to engage in|casual conversation.
Yeah, just talk,|find out her name,
you know, where she lives,|how old she is.
Make sure she's legal age.
Walk to her,|and ask her her name.
Don't be yelling|across the room.
''Yo, what's your name,|sweetie?''
No no.
Eye of the tiger, Sam.|Eye of the tiger.
Come on, focus.|Focus, all right, focus.
Go get her, baby.|Go get her. Let's go.
He got the mac.|There it goes.
What's up?
I'm out again|with Lieutenant Colgan
and his newly named Tombraiders.
Yeah, that was behind us.
That was an IED and close.
Lieutenant Colgan thinks it went off|next to the Abu Hanifa Mosque
or somewhere|in the market area.
Gunner Main, Gunner 6.
Gunner Main, over.
Large crowd, trying|to figure out what happened.
I'll give you|a better tip...
Just boom.
- What?|- Boom boom. Big.
Man, it's close.|It's black.
Take here and run.
Lieutenant Colgan is trying|to figure out what happened.
Did anyone see anything?
Did it just explode?
Or did someone|drop it and run?
The crowd is getting angry,
not because a bomb went off|a few hundred meters away,
but because we're there.
Watch the rocks.|They're throwing 'em to your left.
- What?|- I said watch the rocks.
They already tried to throw some|on the left-hand side.
They're throwing rocks.
Lieutenant Colgan has decided|to stay in the area.
But he's keeping the Humvees|moving in an effort
to disperse the crowd.
Taking potshots|with those rocks.
The crowd is|borderline violent.
Starting to throw stones.
- Yeah.|- Real big one.
We're gonna stay here|to monitor the area.
A second bomb|was found later.
Both bombs were meant|for our patrol
at the mosque earlier|in the day.
I feel lucky, real lucky.
There's a lot of stuff|we get under the cracks.
Lot of stuff can happen here.|You know what I mean?
And if people aren't watching|back in the States,
kinda scares you because you just get|brushed under the carpet,
like all the soldiers|who die here every day.
Almost every day|there's an attack
and someone gets wounded|or someone dies.
But I'm just afraid|that no one's gonna know.
No one's gonna know|the struggle you're going through.
You know what I mean?
My work is done.
I'm leaving|in the morning.
I can just|pick up and leave.
But they have|seven months to go.
Part of me wants to stay
to see all of them|make it through this
and part of me wants|to be at home,
safe with my family.
10 hours later
in a world away|from Baghdad,
I was home with my family.
For me, the war was over.
Three weeks later,
I received an e-mail|from Gunner Palace.
''Dear Mike,
it is my sad duty|to inform you
that First Lieutenant|Ben Colgan
has been killed in action.
He was killed while trying|to block the bridge
by the Abu Hanifa Mosque,
to catch a vehicle associated|with an RPG attack on our compound.
He died knowing that|you loved and respected him
for who he was|and what he was doing.
I know that you had|a special affinity for Ben.
We all mourn his loss.''
Ben's death was close to home.
He was from Seattle, like me.
I knew the kind of house|he grew up in,
the mountains he dreamt of.
He had two daughters.
Looking at my own daughter,
I couldn't think of his death,
only his life.
Just before Christmas
specialist Billie Grimes was|on the cover of ''Time'' magazine
with two other gunners
to represent the American soldier|as Person of the Year.
The next day,|Lieutenant Matt Saltz
and PFC Stuart Moore|were killed by an IED.
A war most thought|to be over
was just beginning.
And the tears|started flowing
As soon|as they called out roll
Can you all really expect us|to keep it under control?
What could you tell a man|who just saw his two friends die
Right before his eyes,|except sip on his gin?
Trying to drown out his hurt|and pain in a sea full of sorrow
Living only for the day|is the motto we follow.
I speak that real flow|after ringing alarms
This country needs us way more|than when we needed Saddam
We start out our day|by readjusting our sights
And checking out the damage|that happened from mortars last night
Yeah, I think the ICDC|is starting to snitch
Telling what goes where|and which places to hit
If they prove me otherwise,|no intent to be shady
I blame it on this war that|made me paranoid and crazy
But this ain't fact,|it's only theory
In my statements about the struggles,|stress and pain every day we facing
Trials and tribulations|daily we do
And not always this life's pain|we wash away in our pool
When we take a dip,|we try to stick to the script
But when those guns start|blazing and our friends get hit
That's when our hearts start racing|and our stomachs get woozy
'Cause for y'all,|this is just a show
But we live|in this movie.
''Captain Robert Brewer|listens as an Iraqi woman begs
for the release of her son|who's been taken into custody.''
''My son blew you guys up.
Will you please bring him|back to me?
He's a good guy.|He's really a good boy.
He only shot eight mortars at you.|It's not that bad, is it?''
Anytime we would ever stoop|to a level of taking it personal,
we end up putting ourselves in|the same shoes that the terrorists are.
We stay focused.
If anything, we say|take it personal,
that just gives you|a boost of adrenaline
to continue on|with the mission.
Coming up!
Coming in!
I didn't want to say anything|that was inappropriate.
Get in there.|Reach in there.
You see it?|Get down in there.
- Come on. No.|- No?
Bullshit. Yeah, you didn't go down|far enough in there.
Oh, dude!
Damn, this just gets|better and better.
Three RPG launchers.
You know how many years|in jail that is?
That is 30 years in jail.
We scored up here. RPGs.
Oh, that's what|I'm talking about.
You know what?|I gave you your chance.
All you had to tell me was,|''Yes, I know where some RPGs,''
and I would have let you go.
Well...
New cell phone?
God damn, these people|have money.
These are brand-new|cell phones.
Two, three, four, five, six.
You're the neighbor, right?
- No relationship, huh?|- Where's this coming from?
- This guy speaks English, by the way.|- Where's this?
Where's all this shit|coming from? Look at that.
- What do you think about that?|- I don't know.
You don't know?
He says, ''I'm a merchant.''
You're a merchant?
No, hell, I ain't|touching his feet.
Keep your|fucking eyes closed.
He doesn't have|any shoes.
When 2/3 leaves|the palace,
the ICDC will take over|security at Adhamiya.
The question is|if the insurgency grows,
will they stand and fight?
Go go.
Right there.
Y'all are looking|and sounding good this morning.
Give yourselves a hand.
From the AFRTS|news center in Washington,
this is|the ''Two-Minute Report.''
Defense Secretary|Donald Rumsfeld said Monday,
''The President's $87 billion|budget request
is an honest summary of what|it will cost the United States
to continue the War|on Terror in Iraq
and Afghanistan|for the next year.''
All these pieces where only|the paint is chipped off
All these pieces where only|the paint is chipped off
is where it hit the door.
But right here,
it went through here.
Right there.
All the way through into...|the glass that broke.
The friction that broke|the glass and came inside
cut his nose right here.
- Is he all right?|- Yeah, he's good.
Part of our $87 billion|budget provided for us
to have some|secondary armor
to put on top of our|thin-skinned Humvees.
This armor was made in Iraq
and is high-quality metal,
and it will probably|slow down the shrapnel
so that it stays in your body
instead of going clean through.
And that's about it.
Be strong without it,|when people finally see my pain
Switches lives|to see why we insane
We wearing clothes|a week in a row
This ain't a thug thing,|it's 'cause we're at war
Dark colors|to cover mud stains
The world's weight is starting|to weaken our back
Considered a ravenous beast|if we just launch an attack
Lose-Iose situation we face|in anticipation and hating
Although we hunted by Satan,|we're frustration abating
The situation we facing,|not only follow but chasing
Those moving with hatred,|that's why we feel so neglected
I'm protecting life|in the present
No need to like this,|but please respect it
This is life.
You're not gonna|hit me, are you?
You're not gonna|hit me, are you?
Nah, I'll stop-- fuck!
Man, calm your ass down.
What's the matter with you?
What happened?|Hey, give me some scissors.
That's a little tight,|isn't it?
Yes.
Last time I saw this guy,
he was taking prisoners.
Until a few weeks ago,
Mohammed Tyson was|a trusted member of Charlie Battery.
Now he's been accused|of identifying
and photographing targets|for the insurgents.
If it's true,
he's responsible for|at least three murders,
and he'll be sent|to Abu Ghraib Prison.
Nothing is black|and white here anymore.
Now do you want to be my guest,|or do you want to be my prisoner?
Fine.
Tyson, do you want to be my guest,|or do you want to be my prisoner?
What's all this?
- You wanna be my guest?|- Yeah, okay.
Relax, man.|I ain't cutting you.
I'm taking it off.|You're my guest.
You're my official guest.
Whatever you give it to him,
he will never|respect anything.
That's why Mohammed Tyson|is detained,
and he's going to be sentenced|to Abu Ghraib for 30 years.
That's it. It's easy.
One plus one equal two.
You're not gonna try|anything funny.
You'd have to get past|80 guys to get to the gate.
Super Cop and I started|to work about four months ago.
Yes.
We have an agreement.|We have to clean Adhamiya.
First of all,|this is our country.
And the second thing,|we want to live in peace.
So that's why we started|to work together.
He gather intel,|we go together
and then we arrest|the bad people.
...they started some|construction in my town,
Colorado Springs,|it's the Woodman and l-25 interchange.
I'm not really exactly sure what|the construction was for,
but I know they|had started it.
It was causing lots|of backups.
Now I dropped out|of high school,
then went back|to high school again,
and they're still working|on it and stuff.
After I dropped out|of high school again,
I didn't really do much|but a lot of drugs and drinking.
That got old.|I joined the army, right?
Then I'm in Germany|for a year just partying my ass off.
All of a sudden, the army slaps down|this deployment thing.
They're all like,|''You're going to war, right?''
So I go to war.|We destroy a country.
We rebuild a country.
Now I had gotten online
and looked at a Colorado Springs|newspaper the other day,
and one of the headlines was
''Woodman and l-25 Project|Has Some Progress.''
How do I go through all of that
and they have ''some'' progress?
Who knows? Maybe I'll|become president.
Sound good?
Our other vehicle just decided|to keep on fucking driving,
and not even bother to look back|to see if we were still there.
That was really|thoughtful of 'em.
Any station on this,|this is HB405.
Radio check, over.
The worst thing that|could happen?
Well, if you had diarrhea|right now,
that would probably suck|pretty fucking bad.
You know, there's lots of places|around here, if you look around,
someone could shoot|a fucking RPG at us.
This is not my country.
When I leave here,|I'm fucking gone.
They're here to get paid.
Soon as we leave, guess what|the fuck they're gonna do?
I'll hear about|this shit on the news.
I'm gonna feel like crap|because I tried to train 'em.
I tried to train 'em.|I tried to train 'em,
but I can't train someone|who doesn't give a shit.
- And this is yours, not mine.|- I know.
The Military Postal Service|agency is now processing
The Military Postal Service|agency is now processing
around 2 million Ibs.|of mail each week
for troops in Iraq|and Afghanistan.
Lieutenant Commander Brian Lomax,|chief of policy for the agency,
says all those letters|and packages
help keep service members|connected to home.
Yes.
Don't fucking move.
I don't know the rest|of the words.
Well, I'm trying this|new flavor of Easy Mac.
It's Tombstone Cheese Pizza.
Little curious.
That's what us imams do.|We're leaders.
We try and get things straight.
You know, make sure everything|works out nice and neat.
I gotta try something|before I let my people fall
into a big mistake.
Most imams|also speak Arabic.
I do the same.
It says...
''From national citizens.''
That means you.
Well, yes.
I got the no beer blues
Yes, I do
My blood system's dry
My brain's gonna fry
Yeah, I got|the no beer blues!
They believe that|we betrayed our country
because we work with the army,|and that's not true.
They are the real traitors,|and we are the good guys.
We know we are|the good guys
because we want to make|the new Iraq a good country,
a good Iraq country,
and they don't|want this to happen.
Because if this happens...
...and these people|can't live without war.
They've been|living in wars
from the beginning|of their lives.
And it's hard for them to change|and see everyone happy.
Everyone goes back,|sits with his children,
his wife, friends.
They say that's|too much for us.
Hey, what happened|this morning?
This morning...
the Shiites were having|their holy day,
doing their usual walks|around Baghdad
and their little pilgrimage
to some of the holy shrines|in the area.
And then went over|to Kadhimiya
and a couple explosions|went off.
Doctors at the hospital say
at least 75 people|were killed thus far.
When the QRF from|the nights and Dakota
went over to assess|the situation
and try to help|with medical support,
they got there only to be pelted|by rocks and sticks
and bottles and chairs and anything|Iraqis could pick up and throw.
It's been|a wonderful morning.
Listen up.
Listen up.
Hey, when we get out here,|we're not standing up.
Everybody gonna get down,|turn around and face out.
We gotta go up here|and check out this thing.
Here's the thing. We're going to|check out up here by the mosque.
There's supposed to be|some army up here that's armed.
We're going up here|to see how many it is.
We're gonna let the IPs know.|They're gonna disarm 'em.
If they don't disarm 'em, we go back|and disarm 'em ourselves. Understood?
All right.
Oh, shit.
Get down.
We got it.
IEDs are the scariest.
By far have got to be|the scariest.
Gunfire and crap like that,|that shit don't bother me.
You know, it's whatever,
But IEDs? They hide that shit|in the garbage, man.
This whole country's garbage.|Everything is just trash.
And it could be anywhere,|you know?
When we're going around corners, and|there's a box on the side of the road.
You know, cringe|and take the turn
and hopefully|you don't hear a bang.
...and AK-47##s|are standing over there.
The lieutenant is looking|for armed members
of Mahdi's army,|the Shia militia.
While not yet hostile|to the coalition,
they're growing in numbers.
The talk on the street|is civil war.
If it comes,
these soldiers|will be targeted
by every faction.
I don't care|what anybody says.
There's peaceful places in Iraq,|but this ain't one of them.
Know that anybody|who's been here has lived it,
seen it and done it.
They've done their job.
You too!|Get on the fucking ground!
- Get on the fucking ground!|- Get the fuck down!
Yeah, they're gonna|sit down...
All right, get your hands up.|These the bad guys?
Two coming out!
Gentlemen, I'm sorry for|the inconvenience tonight.
But it's necessary|for the security of Iraq.
We have who we're|looking for right now.
We'll try to make it|short, quick and painless.
Well, it's been interesting,|this last year.
It's a once|in a lifetime chance
to live|in a bombed-out palace
and then make|the most of it.
I definitely won't have ceilings|as high as this probably ever again
or chandeliers as many|as I'm living under right now,
but it's the right thing|to do to give it back
to the Iraqi people.
And we're all looking back to going back|to Giessen, Germany.
There's still a lot|of mission between now
and the time we do that,|and we have some definable goals
that we want to get accomplished|before we leave.
When you sit and watch TV,|and you go to your 9:00 to 5:00 job,
and you complain|about the pizza being late,
there's no way you're|gonna know how we live here.
Someone being|sympathetic to this,
I don't even know if I'd be sympathetic|if I wasn't in the army.
After you watch this,
you're gonna go get|your popcorn out of the microwave
and talk about what I say.
And you'll forget me|by the end of this.
You'll forget all of this.
Only people who will|remember this is us.
I don't think|anywhere in history
has somebody killed|somebody else
and something better|has come out of it.
It's just not possible.
I couldn't even answer|that question.
There's not really|any rationalization
behind someone's|child dying.
I don't think it's...
worth the death|of someone's family member.
Okay.
Turn left.
I flew home to Germany|on a MedEvac,
surrounded|by wounded soldiers.
Three weeks later,
fighting erupted in Adhamiya.
Unlike a movie,
war has no end.
Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord.
You ain't nobody, chief,|so stay on guard.
Nobody loves you!
I'll be back soon, honey.|Don't worry about it.
I love you, man!
Oh, Lord, he might|throw me off the vehicle.
I love you!
Gunner, you're always invited.
You know that.|That's right.
Gunner Palace, basically,|an adult's paradise.
