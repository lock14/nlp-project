{1988}{2043}In the cemetery|it was scary
{2044}{2106}Shit ain't necessary, I'm gonna|let you niggas, here we go
{2107}{2156}I'm very deadly,|I bust a nigga's head on top
{2157}{2202}Body don't drop,|call a cop
{2202}{2247}Nigga know Little E,|you know I got it locked
{2247}{2287}Too hot,|don't stop...
{2764}{2823}Most of us don't see|this on the news anymore.
{2824}{2901}We have reality TV instead--
{2902}{2971}''Joe Millionaire,''|''Survivor.''
{2972}{3017}Well, survive this--
{3018}{3096}a year in Baghdad|without changing the channel.
{3132}{3134}Hit it, uh uh,|2003, uh
{3134}{3217}Hit it, uh uh,|2003, uh
{3218}{3281}They got us out here|in Baghdad, life is hard
{3282}{3337}Got us pullin'|fuckin' two hours ago
{3337}{3361}Got us pullin'|fuckin' two hours ago
{3362}{3429}And then they up it up|to 8 between 1 2
{3430}{3506}I don't give a fuck,|I think I'm stuck in hell, uh
{3507}{3591}I'd rather be there|instead of jail...
{3592}{3634}Joint Chiefs Chairman|General Richard Myers
{3635}{3700}has just returned from Iraq.|He praised US forces,
{3701}{3750}saying morale is high
{3751}{3816}and troops are committed|to getting the job done.
{3817}{3866}They understand why|they're in Iraq.
{3867}{3920}And they understand|the greater mission...
{3921}{3957}Move that piece|of shit, Commo.
{3958}{4007}...the war in Iraq|is just one part.
{4008}{4057}It's particularly|interesting to note
{4058}{4124}how well our forces are able|to switch from tracking down
{4125}{4201}the violent former Baath|regime's fellow men
{4202}{4262}to assisting Iraqis|in rebuilding their country.
{4262}{4313}But the soldiers understand|their mission,
{4314}{4324}and they accept|their conditions,
{4324}{4363}and they accept|their conditions,
{4364}{4420}and we're working on the quality|of life to make it better.
{4421}{4470}Welcome to Gunner Palace.
{4471}{4490}This palace was built|after the first Gulf War
{4490}{4579}This palace was built|after the first Gulf War
{4580}{4653}for Saddam Hussein's|first wife.
{4654}{4742}Later it was given|to his son Uday,
{4743}{4817}who used it quite often
{4818}{4893}to have his wild parties.
{4894}{4968}We dropped a bomb on it,|and now we party in it.
{4969}{5062}This building was damaged|during the war.
{5063}{5166}This here was like|an open ballroom-type area.
{5228}{5280}Over here, you can see|where the staircase is going.
{5281}{5371}The staircase is still|pretty much safe to use.
{5372}{5426}You can get a good view.
{5427}{5484}We live from Baghdad,|man, it's so sad...
{5485}{5546}From inside of...
{5547}{5601}the good portion
{5602}{5663}of the building|to the, uh...
{5748}{5809}This is our party site|right here.
{5859}{5900}You can see|where I'm putting in--
{5901}{5941}I've got a driver's range|for golf.
{5942}{5993}For people who like|to play golf, I'm putting in
{5994}{6056}three putting greens.
{6057}{6107}You can't--|you can't put that--
{6107}{6133}This is just speculation.
{6133}{6148}This is just speculation.
{6149}{6198}We heard before|we moved in there
{6199}{6251}this is one of Uday's|weekend party palaces.
{6252}{6301}As you look around here,
{6302}{6372}you can see it was certainly set up|for that, a little paradise.
{6372}{6437}It's got a stocked|fishing pond.
{6438}{6443}It has a lot of these|little enclave buildings
{6443}{6495}It has a lot of these|little enclave buildings
{6496}{6571}that are the most impractically set up|that you could ever imagine.
{6572}{6621}You gotta wonder who he was|trying to impress.
{6622}{6667}If you look around,
{6667}{6729}you've got the circular bed|in the back.
{6730}{6776}The gaudy furniture.
{6777}{6872}So, yes, we do know|this was Uday's palace.
{6872}{6932}Everybody said so. The locals said so.|The leaders said so.
{6933}{6991}They've said they never had|an opportunity to be in here.
{6992}{7056}I think they've already got two down.
{7057}{7117}Okay, sounds good.|I'll get with you a little later.
{7199}{7268}The particular area|of Adhamiya
{7269}{7318}that I think that|we've seen--
{7319}{7368}it's been so contentious--
{7369}{7444}has been the Abu Hanifa|area in particular.
{7445}{7522}There's other areas|as well,
{7523}{7597}but that one's the one that|appears to be the hotbed
{7597}{7698}or the center of gravity|for Baath party meetings.
{7699}{7779}You probably remember|seeing Saddam Hussein--
{7780}{7834}it was the last time,|as a matter of fact,
{7835}{7897}that he was seen publicly|lifted up on shoulders
{7897}{7947}in a particular|market square.
{7948}{8003}Well, that's the Abu Hanifa|market square.
{8316}{8359}Hey, you're too close.
{8360}{8408}We've got a couple|of wannabe movie stars.
{8409}{8491}These guys were trained|to stop a Russian advance,
{8492}{8554}artillery,|the guns of Giessen.
{8555}{8631}They live to blow stuff up.
{8693}{8748}But out here|in the streets of Baghdad,
{8749}{8828}they become policemen,|social workers and politicians.
{8829}{8937}Today, truant officers.|Two Humvees
{8938}{8981}and a squad of heavily|armed soldiers
{8982}{9071}to take a glue-sniffing kid|off the street.
{9151}{9226}He's not hurting anywhere.|He's just all fucked up.
{9256}{9309}Come on, get up there.|Come on.
{9382}{9444}This kid's been causing|multiple problems.
{9445}{9494}We picked him up|four or five times.
{9495}{9570}Everything|from basic shoplifting
{9571}{9633}to breaking and entering,|burglary.
{9634}{9724}Just an orphaned kid.|He's on drugs.
{9725}{9777}One of them heartbreaker stories.
{9778}{9827}Nothing really you can do
{9828}{9890}but try to get him|into some kind of assistance.
{9891}{9971}This is an AFRTS|news minute.
{9972}{10043}Children cheered on|US soldiers
{10044}{10096}as classes started|at two schools
{10097}{10145}in Abu Ghraib City, Iraq.
{10146}{10196}Officials say|the schools were gutted
{10197}{10266}and had been used to store|weapons and ammunition.
{10267}{10342}But with hard work and cooperation|from the local people,
{10342}{10406}the troops were able|to repair the damage.
{10407}{10457}Come here.
{10773}{10839}A lot of these guys|are fresh out of high school.
{10840}{10936}They come from towns that read like|an atlas of a forgotten America--
{10937}{11019}Pine Bluff,|Chesterton, Argyle.
{11020}{11069}The area I come from|is very small.
{11070}{11111}There's not much to it.
{11112}{11197}Not a lot of opportunities|for people fresh out of high school.
{11197}{11266}So it was either community|college or go do something.
{11267}{11323}Travel the world,|get paid for it.
{11324}{11385}Experience places|like this.
{11386}{11451}There's nothing else like it.|Nothing else like it.
{11452}{11518}I talked to just some friends|I have back home,
{11519}{11568}and their just perception|of this is totally different.
{11569}{11618}They just say to me,
{11619}{11692}''Oh, you get to go out shopping|and stuff like that, right?''
{11693}{11776}It's like, ''No no no.|It's much different than that.''
{11777}{11831}You try to explain
{11832}{11948}the streets and the way|these people have to live.
{11949}{12025}And they can't grip it.|They can't grip it.
{12068}{12134}I don't think anybody can.
{12721}{12779}It looks normal,
{12780}{12855}but the soldiers sense|something that I can't see.
{12939}{12988}Yeah, see...
{12989}{13045}They really don't like|Americans back here.
{13332}{13375}What's up?
{13454}{13465}This is an AFRTS|news minute.
{13465}{13504}This is an AFRTS|news minute.
{13505}{13554}US troops mobilized|during recent deployments
{13555}{13604}to Iraq and Afghanistan
{13605}{13669}will not have to worry about|their student loan obligations
{13670}{13728}while fighting overseas.
{13729}{13776}The President has|signed into law
{13777}{13853}the Higher Education Relief|Opportunities for Students...
{13854}{13905}of 2003.
{13906}{13910}That extends for another|two years benefits--
{13910}{13952}That extends for another|two years benefits--
{13953}{14019}They're trying|to hit the camp.
{14020}{14081}Is someone smoking|a cigarette in the shitters?
{14350}{14423}- Where is it?|- It's in the box, dude.
{14424}{14476}It's in the fucking box?
{14477}{14529}Dude, he was in my bag.
{14581}{14634}That's who bagged|your crackers.
{14635}{14684}That's who ate|my freakin' crackers.
{14685}{14711}This is my new room--
{14712}{14762}an old guardhouse|in Gate 2.
{14763}{14812}A few minutes ago
{14813}{14881}six mortars impacted|a few hundred meters away,
{14882}{14908}tossing up dirt
{14909}{14961}and doing little damage.
{14962}{15034}But the only enemy|they see here is the rat.
{15035}{15101}Never mind the explosions,|get the rat.
{15102}{15159}Let me tell you how we kill|a rat in Indiana.
{15160}{15209}Good.
{15210}{15274}I'll help you kill one|of them things.
{15275}{15329}I have 10 roommates.
{15330}{15379}Wilf, the youngest, is 19.
{15380}{15475}He joined the Army at 17.|He hails from Colorado,
{15476}{15572}just down the road|from Columbine and South Park.
{15573}{15621}Wilf is what they call|the new Army,
{15622}{15666}the Army of One.
{15667}{15735}I'm PFC Stuart Wilf, and you have|my permission to record this.
{15736}{15785}This is my shirt,
{15786}{15867}and that's my|desktop background.
{16602}{16676}The lovely sights.
{16677}{16737}Happy people.
{16773}{16813}The flag.
{16873}{16932}I've got a gun.
{17037}{17086}Yes.
{17123}{17195}Once,|not on purpose.
{17264}{17329}But no one was hurt.|It was all right.
{17356}{17418}Once at a building.
{17419}{17460}Yes.
{17498}{17548}Possibly.
{17611}{17660}You never know.
{17661}{17742}Stranger things|have happened.
{17743}{17805}Very well|could have been.
{17806}{17859}And if there was|someone in there,
{17860}{17911}well, they weren't happy.|I can tell you that.
{17912}{17961}Every time I walk|the streets
{17962}{18011}I keep the eye|on the foes
{18012}{18079}Got slugs that'll fuck you|in your dreams and goals
{18080}{18148}Only roll with real thugs,|and y'all niggas is pussy
{18149}{18177}Got custom-made coffins|for the faggot that pushed me
{18177}{18209}Got custom-made coffins|for the faggot that pushed me
{18210}{18282}Fake niggas don't even tempt me,|false move and you're dead
{18282}{18336}Someone pushed the fuckin' brains|out of the back of your head
{18337}{18403}Fuck around and change my mind|and get your family instead
{18404}{18466}Run up in your crib and murder you|while you sleepin' in bed.
{18819}{18870}Hey. Hey, mister.
{18871}{18913}What?
{19072}{19112}Back up.
{19113}{19169}Go on, back up.
{19207}{19292}Captain Garcia spotted|a suspicious-Iooking bag
{19293}{19339}up the road|on the meridian.
{19340}{19408}It could be an improvised|explosive device
{19409}{19488}or IED|as they're called.
{19637}{19706}IEDs are every soldier's|worst fear.
{19707}{19777}They're in bags, pots,|garbage piles, trees
{19778}{19846}and sometimes even molded|into concrete curbs.
{19847}{19932}Nobody wants to get near|this thing, whatever it is.
{19932}{19982}Least of all, me.
{20085}{20134}It's empty.
{20135}{20228}We stopped traffic in both|directions for 15 minutes
{20229}{20303}for an empty plastic bag,|and the Iraqis are laughing at us.
{20304}{20368}That was a really suspiciously|placed bag of trash.
{20369}{20419}It's true.
{20567}{20643}No, I'm not scared because I believe|in what I am doing,
{20644}{20738}but I'm rather careful.
{20739}{20799}Yeah, so there's something different|between ''to be careful''
{20800}{20849}and ''to be scared of.''
{20850}{20899}If I was scared completely,
{20900}{20949}I would have left|at my own job.
{20950}{21025}But I'm trying to be careful|because I got my parents waiting
{21026}{21089}for me to back safe|and sound home.
{21090}{21154}And you know, God is basically|watching over me,
{21155}{21206}and He's the best protector|and preserver.
{21282}{21331}I'm not trying to give|an ideal picture
{21332}{21396}about the American people.|They are just human beings.
{21397}{21461}They make mistakes|and make good things
{21462}{21512}like me|and any other one,
{21512}{21589}but American people
{21590}{21647}are getting friendly
{21648}{21697}with anyone, easily.
{21698}{21747}They don't have barriers.
{21748}{21797}If you sit with somebody|for 10 minutes,
{21798}{21867}he's gonna narrate his whole|life story for you.
{21868}{21934}And this certainly rare to be found|in somebody else.
{21935}{21936}Here we go.|We're in the middle of Baghdad.
{21936}{22001}Here we go.|We're in the middle of Baghdad.
{22002}{22062}We're doing another plug|for Snapple Pink Lemonade.
{22063}{22120}When I retire, I want Snapple|for the rest of my life.
{22121}{22221}Yeah, man, I've always dreamed|of this my whole life.
{22222}{22272}When I was a kid, I always|wanted to be the first one
{22272}{22344}to go to strange|faraway places,
{22345}{22394}meet new people,
{22395}{22453}be the first kid on my block|with a confirmed kill
{22454}{22551}and drink Snapple|in Uday's old swimming pool.
{22552}{22612}I usually drink other things|in the swimming pool.
{22613}{22695}They won't let us drink beer|and alcohol and stuff like that.
{22696}{22747}Snapple's pretty good.
{23029}{23078}Mike Tyson.
{23079}{23158}The guy with the do-rag|on his head is Mohammed Tyson.
{23159}{23228}The guy with the blindfold|is Tyson's prisoner.
{23229}{23332}Mohammed, Mustafa and Roy|are Charlie Battery's interpreters.
{23333}{23386}The prisoner|is a known assassin,
{23387}{23472}hired to kill Iraqis who are|cooperating with the coalition.
{23473}{23556}Mohammed and Roy saw the assassin|driving down the street today
{23557}{23592}on his motorcycle.
{23593}{23647}So they jumped out|of the bushes and tackled him.
{23712}{23797}We suppose that you arrest|the most important person.
{23904}{23971}I talk to him,|by the way, for an hour
{23972}{24021}before I come here.
{24022}{24126}He has a very strong|personality,
{24127}{24182}a well confidence|in himself,
{24183}{24232}and he knows|what he's doing
{24233}{24282}and what he's speaking.
{24283}{24332}Even I've told him|several times
{24333}{24382}that he's going to be|in jail, so confess,
{24383}{24438}tell everything that you know.|He said, ''I don't mind.
{24439}{24526}I can go to jail.|I don't care about it.''
{24677}{24743}Let them pack the nice gats|with the hollow tips in 'em
{24744}{24795}Bodies look like polka-dots|from the hole I put in 'em
{24796}{24870}Me and my thug niggas|specialize in splitting those wigs
{24871}{24920}Gotta a killer squad that's thorough,|into toys like Flynt
{24921}{24964}Our crew will be big
{24965}{25014}I told your act|he's fucking with thugs
{25015}{25095}Mr. Crief is so quick to put a slug|in your mug, fake-ass bitch.
{25240}{25286}Basil!
{25337}{25405}Basil is the coolest Iraqi|I've ever met.
{25531}{25580}We both like having|a good time.
{25581}{25661}- Yes.|- We're both pretty positive, I think.
{25736}{25790}Oh, yeah.|Not each other.
{25791}{25876}He might wanna fuck me,|but, uh... no.
{26027}{26042}Secretary Rumsfeld|said terrorists
{26042}{26089}Secretary Rumsfeld|said terrorists
{26090}{26151}are starting to realize|things are changing
{26152}{26201}in favor|of the Iraqi people.
{26202}{26276}They see the Iraqi Governing Council|getting on its feet.
{26749}{26836}I think he's pissed at that guy.|The guy across the table
{26837}{26924}from him is saying it's the mosque that's|doing this to the coalition.
{26925}{26974}That's what pissed|this guy off.
{27025}{27067}Gentlemen, gentlemen.
{27068}{27154}Please. Remember,|we had this talk about acting civilly?
{27155}{27232}Two months ago--|two months ago--
{27233}{27319}you guys--|gentlemen, please!
{27320}{27395}About two months ago,|we talked about acting civilly.
{27396}{27467}You've come so far,|so fast.
{27467}{27563}Please let's not digress. I'm sure|we can get the same discussion done
{27564}{27614}without screaming|across the table.
{27615}{27675}Now is the issue that we have|one of our council members
{27676}{27728}that's not showing up
{27729}{27778}because he's|been threatened?
{27779}{27824}Yes.
{27941}{27996}Could one of you,|when we break, come to me
{27997}{28047}with as much information|that you have
{28047}{28113}on who's threatening him|and when and where,
{28114}{28163}and I'll do what I can?
{28164}{28234}Certainly, if we haven't|armed him yet,
{28235}{28284}we're at the position|where we need to go ahead
{28285}{28332}and give him a weapons card|and a weapon.
{28333}{28388}You have glasses on?|You have some sort of eye protection?
{28388}{28401}You have glasses on?|You have some sort of eye protection?
{28497}{28575}There you go.|Is it on ''safe'' now?
{28576}{28625}You couldn't shoot it|because it's on ''safe.''
{28626}{28675}So you want to|push it over.
{28676}{28725}There you go.|Okay, good.
{28726}{28802}And make sure|you aim nice and low
{28803}{28857}into the sandbags.|Into the sandbags.
{28858}{28907}The sandbags.
{28935}{28984}- Okay, aim into the sandbags.|- Okay.
{28985}{29049}Into the bags. You know|what I'm talking about?
{29050}{29128}Yeah.|Not high, low.
{29129}{29178}Into the--
{29179}{29256}- There you go. That's good.|- I'm afraid you are--
{29257}{29306}No, that's good.|You're good.
{29307}{29357}You're good,|but aim into the bags.
{29460}{29503}- Okay, that's good.|- Good?
{29504}{29555}You're good. You feel|comfortable with it?
{29556}{29623}There you go. Now let's see where|to squeeze the trigger.
{29624}{29672}Now take it off|the safety.
{29673}{29759}See? That's it.|You got it. You good?
{29760}{29811}You look nervous.|Are you okay?
{29812}{29862}All right.
{30052}{30112}From the AFRTS|news center in Washington,
{30112}{30133}this is|the ''Two-Minute Report.''
{30133}{30161}this is|the ''Two-Minute Report.''
{30162}{30246}Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld|Wednesday urged Congress
{30247}{30342}to pass the President's $87 billion|supplemental budget request
{30342}{30392}for Iraq and Afghanistan.
{30392}{30442}Mr. Rumsfeld said most|of the money
{30442}{30492}will go to support US troops,
{30492}{30542}who he said,|''Need it and need it soon.''
{30543}{30550}Smoking weed,|can't smoke in the army
{30550}{30599}Smoking weed,|can't smoke in the army
{30600}{30666}Nigga trying to harm me,|bomb me, don't give a fuck
{30667}{30698}Vietnam--|putting it down
{30699}{30748}Coming down, North Carolina|funky sound
{30749}{30811}Get down from the C-Town,|buck, shit
{30812}{30864}Come down, tuck it down|with my tight grip
{30865}{30914}20'' rims on the side
{30915}{30964}Diamonds|in my teeth, look.
{30965}{30970}Do you know|where the mother is?
{30970}{31014}Do you know|where the mother is?
{31070}{31124}I'm sorry?|They found her in the street?
{31125}{31182}Yes.
{31183}{31242}Where's the mommy?|Oh, she's crying.
{31307}{31375}Look at her features.|They're so formed.
{31376}{31438}She just look like a little,|like a little...
{31547}{31644}My wife gave birth|to our first son June 30
{31645}{31711}while I was out here, so...
{31746}{31806}- Boy or a girl?|- Little boy.
{31862}{31931}I've seen pictures,|but I haven't gotten to hold him yet.
{32213}{32316}This is SpongeBob SquarePants.
{32317}{32391}He's very popular back|in the United States.
{32392}{32452}One of my heroes.
{32525}{32533}Today what we're doing
{32533}{32578}Today what we're doing
{32579}{32627}is we got a recent tip
{32627}{32740}of counterintelligence that|we have number 89 on the blacklist,
{32741}{32827}an elderly gentlemen,|Basil Osan Hussein al-Habib,
{32828}{32880}about 60 years old.
{32881}{32930}So we expect|a soft compliant entry.
{32931}{32993}It won't be|a difficult raid to do.
{32994}{33061}The particular individual|in question, number 89,
{33062}{33146}was the former Director General|for Chemical Weapons Development
{33147}{33228}for the Ministry of Defense,|so he's of some value to us,
{33229}{33284}mainly for questioning,|and we'll pass him on
{33285}{33333}and send him back to BiOp.
{33334}{33391}It's a quiet night.
{33489}{33541}Two coming in!
{33542}{33599}How you doing, sir?
{33600}{33687}Good good. It's always good|to get your man, isn't it?
{33688}{33733}Roger that, sir.
{33734}{33803}- Has he been quiet?|- Yeah, he's pretty cooperative, sir.
{33804}{33871}- He speaks pretty good English, too.|- Okay, where's his wife?
{33872}{33942}Sir, his wife is here.|We didn't wake his kids up.
{33943}{34013}His kids are still sleeping. I told them|just to lay down. It wasn't a big thing.
{34014}{34064}Okay, good good.|Wife doing all right?
{34065}{34115}Roger, sir.
{34632}{34695}He's diabetic.
{34696}{34745}Medics has the medicine.
{34746}{34805}We have all the medicine|we need for him, okay? We're good.
{34806}{34855}You have all your medicine|you need, right?
{34856}{34917}- Yes, we got it.|- Okay.
{34918}{34968}It's okay.
{34969}{35028}- Ma'am.|- Osan.
{35029}{35073}Hey, LT.
{35507}{35557}There's an IED up ahead.
{35558}{35609}There's an IED up ahead!
{35610}{35666}I'm out of here, like 2000.
{35667}{35733}Alaska, Hawaii, Texas,
{35734}{35828}Oklahoma, Louisiana, all parts|in-between. You know what I'm saying?
{35829}{35883}These flies over here|are awful.
{35884}{35960}The good news is you|got your back to it.
{35961}{36012}You won't see|what's coming.
{36013}{36060}''Hey, gimme 18 Whoppers.''|He's like, ''What?''
{36060}{36079}''Hey, gimme 18 Whoppers.''|He's like, ''What?''
{36080}{36156}I was like, ''18 Whoppers.'' He's like,|''No one ever orders this big.''
{36157}{36225}I was like, ''I do.|Gimme my Whoppers.''
{36226}{36306}He reaches over and grabs|a Coke and just goes--
{36307}{36383}Food is good.|I love Burger King.
{36384}{36461}I love McDonald's.|I love all these guys.
{36462}{36511}Food.
{36512}{36579}Food is good.
{36580}{36631}All right, all right.
{36632}{36696}Hey, what's going on?
{36747}{36798}Whoo!
{36869}{36937}Maybe it's all just burned|into my mind now.
{36938}{37002}I'm just imagining|all of it.
{37067}{37116}Who knows?
{37117}{37122}We'll keep one SAW|back here.
{37122}{37166}We'll keep one SAW|back here.
{37167}{37216}Just know where|your people are.
{37217}{37293}We got the rear, so you start|holding 'em like you fucking mean it.
{37410}{37485}Right now it's not 20 guys|with armed weapons anymore.
{37486}{37548}They said it's four,|and they might be across the river.
{37549}{37618}So just keep that in mind,|keep your eyes open,
{37619}{37692}because if it's anything|like last night,
{37693}{37748}it's gonna be ugly,|gentlemen.
{37777}{37861}When we first got here,|they were waving at us.
{37862}{37953}And next minute,|soon as we drive by,
{37954}{37997}we'd get shot at.
{37998}{38047}Or some days they'd|look at us mean
{38048}{38144}and give us gestures|that they didn't want us there.
{38145}{38211}You know, you just get|the feeling that these guys,
{38212}{38269}they don't care|too much about you,
{38270}{38355}so they will take|your life.
{38695}{38786}If they don't have any direct|family members in the military,
{38787}{38848}then it's just|entertainment for them.
{38849}{38904}This is just|entertainment for them.
{38905}{38954}A lot of people|watch the war
{38955}{39047}because it was almost 24/7|action footage,
{39048}{39136}better than any movie,|better than any sitcom.
{39137}{39196}This is real life drama|right here.
{39197}{39259}But soon as the coverage|stopped when the war was over,
{39260}{39309}there was no entertainment|anymore
{39310}{39359}unless you have some|live footage
{39360}{39409}of someone getting shot|in the street
{39410}{39486}or something like that.|No one cares.
{39487}{39492}Hey, it's clear.
{39492}{39555}Hey, it's clear.
{39556}{39614}- Cleared.|- Don't fucking do it!
{39615}{39662}Don't fight me,|motherfucker!
{39739}{39797}He was going for this one.
{39798}{39847}I punched him in his|fucking face.
{39848}{39887}Oh, yeah?
{39888}{39971}Yeah, there's his glasses|right there.
{40191}{40287}Intelligence says that hard-core|bomb builders are in this house.
{40288}{40371}They're looking|for a few brothers.
{40507}{40579}So I'm working.
{40623}{40672}I'm working, too.
{40673}{40750}I don't know|what it's for.
{40751}{40838}I'm from...|Medical Technology.
{41205}{41296}Keep your mouth shut.
{41343}{41392}It's okay.|It's okay.
{41393}{41448}You keep|your mouth shut.
{41592}{41670}Hey, yeah.|Be quiet, all right?
{41806}{41856}Be quiet!
{42124}{42173}Just shut your mouth.
{42174}{42225}Hey, shut up!
{42355}{42412}Pick him up.|He goes outside the wall.
{42450}{42510}- This one?|- No, the reporter right here.
{42511}{42551}The reporter guy|likes to talk.
{42552}{42605}He goes outside the wall.
{42606}{42651}Just like that.|''Shut him up.''
{42652}{42701}Yeah.
{42742}{42829}No evidence of bomb building|was found in the house.
{42830}{42882}All of the brothers|were detained
{42883}{42934}and transferred|to Abu Ghraib Prison.
{44507}{44557}Before we went on the patrol,|we all had a gut feeling
{44558}{44607}that something|was gonna happen.
{44608}{44694}When that explosion took off,|it was just a bright light,
{44695}{44736}and I looked closer,
{44737}{44801}and I saw the casualties|laying on the ground.
{44802}{44887}As I went up, I saw|the soldier lying there
{44888}{44937}on the ground moving,
{44938}{44990}so I knew she was all right|and talking.
{44991}{45065}But then I noticed|her left eye
{45066}{45115}maybe had shrapnel in it.
{45116}{45165}So we went ahead and put|a patch on her eye.
{45166}{45222}That's when we started|hearing gunfire.
{45223}{45314}And then the MPs just lit up|the rooftops behind us.
{45315}{45364}At that point,|I was grabbing my weapon,
{45365}{45416}plus staying|over the patient,
{45417}{45475}'cause she didn't have|her Kevlar on at the time.
{45476}{45541}As soon as|the gunfire was over
{45542}{45596}and we found out everyone|was all right,
{45597}{45649}no one got hit,
{45650}{45741}then we proceeded to get|everyone in their vehicles.
{45742}{45835}We didn't get maybe|50 meters from that area,
{45836}{45885}and the second one|went off.
{45936}{45941}This is an AFRTS|news minute.
{45941}{46003}This is an AFRTS|news minute.
{46004}{46074}Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs|General Peter Pace
{46075}{46150}says the military is|working quickly to make sure
{46151}{46193}all service members
{46194}{46261}have access to body armor|with the latest technology.
{46262}{46343}General Pace and Defense Secretary|Donald Rumsfeld--
{46344}{46433}Six hours later,|an IED meant for a Humvee
{46434}{46489}destroyed two civilian buses.
{46490}{46551}Dozens were killed|and wounded.
{46552}{46599}When you look at the ground,|you can't really see the blood
{46600}{46686}'cause the road is, like, black,
{46687}{46764}so it just looks like water|on the ground, right?
{46765}{46841}And the bus?|Oh God.
{46842}{46913}I ain't want to look|at the bus no more.
{46914}{47003}The Humvee|got messed up bad.
{47004}{47050}Our guys are still safe.|Our guys are still good,
{47051}{47140}so thank the Lord for that,|for our sake.
{47245}{47302}Just one more day|in Baghdad.
{47386}{47476}Yo yo yo yo
{47477}{47524}Hey, yo, sometimes|I just stand in the zone
{47525}{47574}Contemplating and praying|to God
{47575}{47624}That I get a chance|to go home
{47625}{47677}Did you ever get to lay|in the prone
{47678}{47759}Receiving enemy fire while slugs|barely missing your dome?
{47760}{47831}Yo, I noticed that my face|is really aging so quickly
{47832}{47894}'Cause I've seen more|than your average man in his 50s
{47895}{47959}I'm 24 here,|I got two kids and a wife
{47960}{48032}Having visions of them,|picturing me up out of their life
{48033}{48098}This is real life, homey,|and it's just so deep
{48099}{48170}And it's so deep when you|go through long weeks with no sleep
{48171}{48245}IEDs be going off|while we out on patrol
{48246}{48315}Scrap metal be ripping through|your fucking skin and your bones
{48316}{48379}Got a soldier now, and he's|trying to put up a fight
{48380}{48478}But you really knowing he's taking|the last breaths of his life.
{48479}{48531}That's for you, baby.
{49125}{49126}This is an AFRTS|news minute.
{49126}{49176}This is an AFRTS|news minute.
{49177}{49215}The Department of Defense
{49216}{49267}says a new initiative|called Horizontal Fusion
{49268}{49352}will make it easier for war|fighters to do their jobs.
{49353}{49401}Horizontal Fusion is a system|that enables service members
{49401}{49440}Horizontal Fusion is a system|that enables service members
{49441}{49506}to instantly obtain|and share military intelligence
{49507}{49571}with many sources|by going to one place
{49572}{49641}on their computer.|Program Manager--
{49642}{49713}It's Thursday night,|wedding night.
{49714}{49775}It's normal to hear shots|out here.
{49865}{49947}People are just celebrating.|Wedding parties.
{49948}{50010}Drummond, calm down.|It's wedding day.
{50012}{50072}They always shoot up|in the air on wedding day.
{50072}{50124}Calm down!|It's all right.
{50366}{50415}I'm already ready.
{50416}{50498}It's turning out to be|more than a normal Thursday.
{50499}{50548}Downtown by the mosque,
{50549}{50601}a large group|of pro-Saddam demonstrators
{50602}{50652}is trying|to incite a riot.
{50652}{50738}Rocks are being thrown. There are|reports of weapons in the crowd.
{50739}{50807}Gunships, M1 tanks|and Bradley fighting vehicles
{50808}{50862}are circling the area,
{50863}{50954}hoping to diffuse the situation|without bloodshed.
{51096}{51145}So you went to|the damn riot, a Baathist riot,
{51146}{51195}and you got a damn|T-shirt out of it. Outstanding!
{51196}{51245}I even got a headband, sir.
{51246}{51295}That's a handsome-Iooking|devil, too, isn't he?
{51296}{51357}- Got the headband, too.|- Too bad he's scared as shit
{51358}{51416}and dresses up like women now.
{51417}{51466}Did you know that?
{51467}{51527}He hides in women's clothing|so he doesn't get caught anymore.
{51527}{51577}Yeah.
{51577}{51654}I wonder if he wears|panties, too.
{51878}{51882}So what is it|that you do here?
{51882}{51950}So what is it|that you do here?
{51951}{51989}People come to the gate
{51990}{52045}and they say they have|all this kind of...
{52046}{52125}I got information|on such and such,
{52126}{52187}like terrorist activity,|attacks on the compound,
{52187}{52251}weapons of mass destruction,|da-da-da-da-da.
{52252}{52330}I sit here|with an interpreter
{52331}{52380}and figure out if they're|telling the truth or not.
{52381}{52440}At first, I took everything|and wrote it down
{52441}{52486}'cause I didn't know.
{52487}{52540}After a few months,|you start to weed out the liars
{52541}{52613}from the drunks from the people|who are semi sort of telling the truth
{52614}{52678}but just don't know|where the hell it is.
{52717}{52753}It's not too bad.
{52754}{52835}One time I took|these pictures of these guys
{52836}{52885}while they were blindfolded
{52886}{52937}and put all this|information down.
{52938}{52987}I sat there|with my interpreter,
{52988}{53051}I showed them the pictures|and I was like, ''Is this you?''
{53052}{53100}And they're like,|''Yeah yeah.''
{53101}{53169}Then I'd flip it over to the English,|'cause they couldn't read it.
{53170}{53267}I said, ''This shit here tells me|that you're Fedayeen terrorists,
{53268}{53327}and your whole family|is Fedayeen terrorists.
{53328}{53415}You'd better start cooperating,|or you're gonna see Cuba real soon.''
{53417}{53469}And then they started crying.
{53470}{53575}I mean, I'm talking guys like 6'2'',
{53576}{53631}probably about 205 Ibs.|of pure muscle.
{53632}{53684}''Oh, gosh,|don't send me there.''
{53685}{53726}You know?
{53727}{53776}The colonel was with us.
{53777}{53834}He stayed on the median|and you know,
{53835}{53883}just coordinated|over the radio with ready 6,
{53884}{53970}and Captain K ran everything|that went on, like usual.
{53971}{54020}And Bravo was out there.
{54021}{54070}Holy fucking shit!
{54071}{54153}I'm gonna fucking kill|all of you.
{54154}{54205}What the hell was that?
{54270}{54330}Pentagon officials said Tuesday|coalition forces
{54331}{54386}are making steady|and remarkable progress
{54387}{54437}towards stability in Iraq.
{54437}{54481}Defense Secretary|Donald Rumsfeld said,
{54482}{54543}''Since the death of Uday|and Qusay Hussein,
{54544}{54596}more Iraqis|are coming forward
{54597}{54639}with useful information
{54640}{54689}and that has led|to scores of raids.''
{54690}{54701}Yo yo yo yo
{54701}{54747}Yo yo yo yo
{54748}{54802}Yo, it's Baghdad, Iraq
{54803}{54852}And I'm patrolling|the streets
{54853}{54902}I got two Humvees|and my M16
{54903}{54966}My whole team is on the brink,|so we ready to go
{54967}{55041}It's combat, Commo,|niggas running the show.
{55097}{55156}Adhamiya has been on edge|for the last week.
{55157}{55255}Rumors of demonstrations,|Saddam sightings,
{55257}{55328}reports of armed men|near the mosque.
{55329}{55387}The response is a Psy-Op.
{55388}{55456}The whole unit is out|on the streets today,
{55457}{55506}passing out bumper stickers
{55507}{55558}and talking to people.
{55778}{55843}Well, we want 'em|to understand that
{55844}{55899}we're here to help them.|We don't want to change his mind.
{55900}{55949}We don't want him to hate|Saddam Hussein or anything.
{55950}{55999}If he likes him,|he likes him.
{56000}{56058}But I want him to understand|that he's out of power now,
{56059}{56136}and we want to help them.|We really do.
{56356}{56405}No good.
{56511}{56596}- Sex with Saddam?|- Yes.
{56781}{56833}Two lines, two words...
{56904}{56954}Saddam is hero.
{56998}{57050}Chocolate. America.
{57051}{57096}Good America.
{57097}{57157}America good, America.
{57157}{57210}America good, America.
{57211}{57241}Mister, mister.
{57797}{57827}Don't fuck with me, jokers,|I will break you off proper
{57827}{57875}Don't fuck with me, jokers,|I will break you off proper
{57876}{57944}Give shots to your ribs,|give your kids chocolate
{57945}{57994}It's the show stopper,|you must be off your rocker
{57995}{58043}Step to the fate
{58044}{58079}AKA, body dropper
{58080}{58129}I've seen a lotta hot,|nice and bloody days
{58130}{58204}But I'll pick the fight,|baby, going out in a blaze.
{58205}{58209}The G group right now,
{58209}{58285}The G group right now,
{58286}{58361}there's not a whole lot|of counterintelligence on them.
{58362}{58438}We do know that|it's some shady business.
{58439}{58521}They've been dealing|with weapons trafficking.
{58522}{58583}It's a very tight clan.
{58584}{58671}They will do anything|to protect Sheik Majid,
{58672}{58729}although he himself|doesn't pose much of a threat
{58730}{58813}being about a 60-year-old man.|Very well connected.
{58814}{58869}Even the children in here|give early warning
{58870}{58920}as to troop movement|in the sector.
{58921}{58970}That's why we chose|to go in when we did.
{59127}{59174}- What's our total count?|- 1 2.
{59175}{59253}- Is that with Mike?|- Yeah.
{59872}{59912}We roll out,|no getting our gear
{59913}{59998}I'm gonna let your boys know we don't|have no fear, your heart is racing
{59999}{60063}pacing 'cause you're about to go through|this mission
{60064}{60132}Everybody, pay a-fucking-ttention,|we about to start lynching
{60133}{60210}We about to gather up, now, niggas,|here we go, pull bodies off in cuffs
{60211}{60262}We don't give a fuck|when it's time to get there
{60263}{60316}We boys don't really know,|we really don't care.
{60452}{60503}Go! Go!
{60872}{60926}This is not a drill,|in the battlefield
{60927}{60982}In Iraq, yo,|this shit's fucking real
{60983}{61040}Yo, it's getting deep,|it's getting fucking grimy
{61041}{61102}On raids every night,|got the crew behind me
{61103}{61170}Four men run in your house,|clear the room, boom
{61171}{61223}Over here! Over here!
{61361}{61432}Get down, get down!|Down down!
{61432}{61486}Get down!
{61620}{61658}Hold on, hold on!
{61659}{61709}- Get down! Get down!|- Get down! Get down!
{61710}{61771}- Down!|- Get down!
{61772}{61816}- Get down!|- Down, get down!
{61817}{61882}Go to the right.|Where's team two?
{61883}{61934}Come in, come in!
{61935}{61994}Come on,|come on, come on!
{62047}{62083}Get me security.
{62084}{62134}Security! Security!
{62216}{62319}Go go go go go!
{62320}{62357}Go!
{62405}{62479}- Come come come.|- Come come come.
{62480}{62535}Come come.
{62566}{62640}Come on, come on.
{62674}{62735}- Is it clear?|- Clear.
{62994}{63058}Coming in!|Friendlies coming in!
{63219}{63279}Friendlies coming in!
{63280}{63331}You can start with the females.
{63443}{63503}The sheik is out.
{63504}{63555}Gone to Fallujah, they say.
{63556}{63628}Don't know when he'll be back.
{63629}{63671}We went to breach the gate,
{63672}{63713}and we hit it with the Humvee.
{63714}{63776}We continued to come in.|The car was right in front of the door.
{63777}{63850}The car breached the door for us,|so we were able to go right in.
{63851}{63907}Worked out pretty well.
{64267}{64334}Yo yo, out|of your house, oh
{64335}{64375}Flexi-cuffed and shit
{64376}{64437}You in the detainee pit|starting to shit, yo
{64437}{64496}Steady crying,|getting arrested
{64497}{64558}Trying to pray to Allah|'cause he didn't bless you
{64559}{64607}You did the wrong thing|going against 2/3
{64607}{64670}Yo, I represent HHB
{64671}{64723}We the raid masters, yo
{64724}{64767}We got the shit that got|the gun blasters, yo
{64768}{64840}50 cal blowing|your brain, oh
{64841}{64890}I've been to the lead,|and I'm going insane
{64891}{64940}It's all about this shit|right here, the sandbox
{64942}{65031}Yo, blow Haji right out|of his fucking socks.
{65032}{65132}The total haul was $48,000|in Iraqi dinar,
{65133}{65224}a couple of weapons|and some ledger books.
{65225}{65305}Sheik Majid stopped|by the palace a few days later.
{65306}{65366}He was arrested then released.
{65367}{65411}Later that week,
{65412}{65497}the sheik stopped by with|a home-cooked meal for the colonel
{65497}{65589}as if nothing had happened|and they were old friends.
{65838}{65908}Welcome to Gunnerpalooza 4.|I'm Gunner 6.
{65909}{65963}Welcome to Gunner Palace.
{65964}{66018}Anybody new that|hasn't been here before?
{66019}{66068}This is all our guys here?
{66069}{66130}We got one guy?
{66169}{66261}That's right. Gunner Palace,|basically an adult paradise,
{66262}{66311}all for you.
{67860}{67906}For awhile, I couldn't sleep|for awhile.
{67907}{67961}It was the first time|I ever had to kill somebody.
{67962}{68028}So I know for me--
{68029}{68079}you know, it tore me up|pretty bad.
{68080}{68129}But after awhile,|I learned to deal with it
{68130}{68202}because if I look at it|as, you know,
{68202}{68258}it's either gonna be him|or it's gonna be me,
{68259}{68308}I know I'm not doing|the wrong thing.
{68309}{68379}I'm just following orders,|so I'd rather it not be me.
{68380}{68452}So I had to, you know,
{68452}{68502}I learned|to live with it.
{68603}{68607}I live in a place where|the streetlights never come on
{68607}{68675}I live in a place where|the streetlights never come on
{68676}{68725}And every time|you step outside
{68726}{68777}It's like you're hearing|a sad song, yo
{68851}{68901}Every day I been praying|for my life
{68902}{68991}I got a little boy, I'm just trying|to make it home to my wife
{68992}{69043}Not trying to be a victim|of the IED
{69044}{69093}The streets|is full of trash
{69094}{69164}Trying to watch|where I place my feet.
{69457}{69526}All right, it's open.
{69606}{69705}We've got a breach|on the second door.
{69706}{69756}Where's my weapon at?
{70907}{70965}- Go go go!|- Go go!
{71051}{71106}- You ready?|- Yup.
{71169}{71236}- It's empty.|- It's empty?
{71262}{71356}- Yes.|- Good, that makes it easy.
{71541}{71581}You weren't gone very long.
{71581}{71602}You weren't gone very long.
{71831}{71852}I don't feel like I'm defending|my country anymore,
{71852}{71915}I don't feel like I'm defending|my country anymore,
{71916}{71966}and that kinda sucks.
{71967}{72036}That's the whole purpose|when you're a kid to join the Army.
{72037}{72111}You want to be able to feel like,|you know, defend your country,
{72112}{72161}but we're not defending|our country anymore.
{72162}{72215}I know we haven't defended|our country in a while.
{72216}{72267}But you know...
{72268}{72357}it's like-- I don't know.
{72401}{72483}I am 'cause nothing beats it.
{72484}{72537}Nothing beats it, you know?
{72538}{72609}We all talk about|when we're gonna go home,
{72610}{72669}how proud we're gonna be|to be combat vets.
{72670}{72738}How many people can say|they're combat veterans?
{72739}{72804}You know, 19 years old,|I fought in a war.
{73409}{73414}During Friday prayer,
{73414}{73470}During Friday prayer,
{73471}{73536}Lieutenant Colgan|and a squad from Survey
{73537}{73613}come down to the mosque|to monitor what the imam is saying.
{73614}{73680}Some weeks he condemns|the coalition.
{73681}{73771}But this week, he's calling for calm|after the demonstrations.
{73772}{73829}The kids are really funny
{73830}{73892}'cause at first, they'll be|like, ''Mister, mister,''
{73892}{73969}and then they'll realize,|''Oh, misses, misses.''
{73970}{74019}And then they want|to talk to you even more.
{74020}{74084}You get swarms of kids|right in front of you.
{74085}{74134}You're trying|to be friendly to 'em,
{74135}{74186}while looking around,
{74187}{74237}making sure no one's|gonna shoot you.
{74237}{74287}But the guys|are even funnier.
{74287}{74341}You have 'em walk by you,|and then you see 'em.
{74342}{74391}Their heads still turn
{74392}{74460}and they about trip over|themselves trying to walk.
{74461}{74510}And then you have|some people just looking
{74511}{74562}and about crash their cars.
{74563}{74638}I don't think they've ever|seen a woman in uniform.
{74774}{74888}Some days it feels|almost normal here.
{74889}{74951}Lieutenant Colgan and his team|talk to the neighbors.
{74952}{75021}People wave|as they drive past.
{75022}{75096}It's how you hope|it would be-- peaceful.
{75267}{75310}Sam, you are not looking.
{75310}{75336}Sam, you are not looking.
{75337}{75444}Sam, don't make me|hold you at gunpoint.
{75445}{75523}After you establish|eye contact, right?
{75562}{75611}Go into your mac mode.
{75612}{75700}Then give her the what's up nod.|Like, what's up?
{75701}{75787}If she reply back with that,|then you move towards her
{75787}{75867}to engage in|casual conversation.
{75868}{75923}Yeah, just talk,|find out her name,
{75924}{75990}you know, where she lives,|how old she is.
{75991}{76048}Make sure she's legal age.
{76049}{76106}Walk to her,|and ask her her name.
{76107}{76157}Don't be yelling|across the room.
{76158}{76207}''Yo, what's your name,|sweetie?''
{76208}{76249}No no.
{76250}{76315}Eye of the tiger, Sam.|Eye of the tiger.
{76316}{76388}Come on, focus.|Focus, all right, focus.
{76389}{76451}Go get her, baby.|Go get her. Let's go.
{76452}{76511}He got the mac.|There it goes.
{76512}{76566}What's up?
{76687}{76742}I'm out again|with Lieutenant Colgan
{76743}{76801}and his newly named Tombraiders.
{76967}{77046}Yeah, that was behind us.
{77047}{77129}That was an IED and close.
{77130}{77217}Lieutenant Colgan thinks it went off|next to the Abu Hanifa Mosque
{77218}{77275}or somewhere|in the market area.
{77276}{77337}Gunner Main, Gunner 6.
{77338}{77412}Gunner Main, over.
{77516}{77573}Large crowd, trying|to figure out what happened.
{77574}{77624}I'll give you|a better tip...
{78052}{78096}Just boom.
{78097}{78180}- What?|- Boom boom. Big.
{78240}{78351}Man, it's close.|It's black.
{78423}{78504}Take here and run.
{78557}{78622}Lieutenant Colgan is trying|to figure out what happened.
{78623}{78672}Did anyone see anything?
{78673}{78722}Did it just explode?
{78723}{78781}Or did someone|drop it and run?
{78782}{78838}The crowd is getting angry,
{78839}{78906}not because a bomb went off|a few hundred meters away,
{78907}{78958}but because we're there.
{79033}{79107}Watch the rocks.|They're throwing 'em to your left.
{79107}{79186}- What?|- I said watch the rocks.
{79187}{79253}They already tried to throw some|on the left-hand side.
{79380}{79457}They're throwing rocks.
{79458}{79523}Lieutenant Colgan has decided|to stay in the area.
{79524}{79600}But he's keeping the Humvees|moving in an effort
{79602}{79674}to disperse the crowd.
{79675}{79743}Taking potshots|with those rocks.
{79977}{80051}The crowd is|borderline violent.
{80052}{80104}Starting to throw stones.
{80105}{80155}- Yeah.|- Real big one.
{80157}{80221}We're gonna stay here|to monitor the area.
{80222}{80275}A second bomb|was found later.
{80276}{80325}Both bombs were meant|for our patrol
{80326}{80384}at the mosque earlier|in the day.
{80385}{80460}I feel lucky, real lucky.
{80539}{80621}There's a lot of stuff|we get under the cracks.
{80622}{80682}Lot of stuff can happen here.|You know what I mean?
{80683}{80750}And if people aren't watching|back in the States,
{80751}{80823}kinda scares you because you just get|brushed under the carpet,
{80824}{80906}like all the soldiers|who die here every day.
{80907}{80957}Almost every day|there's an attack
{80957}{81011}and someone gets wounded|or someone dies.
{81012}{81119}But I'm just afraid|that no one's gonna know.
{81120}{81215}No one's gonna know|the struggle you're going through.
{81216}{81274}You know what I mean?
{81442}{81491}My work is done.
{81492}{81544}I'm leaving|in the morning.
{81545}{81601}I can just|pick up and leave.
{81602}{81662}But they have|seven months to go.
{81663}{81712}Part of me wants to stay
{81713}{81775}to see all of them|make it through this
{81776}{81825}and part of me wants|to be at home,
{81826}{81896}safe with my family.
{83110}{83162}10 hours later
{83163}{83213}in a world away|from Baghdad,
{83214}{83276}I was home with my family.
{83361}{83439}For me, the war was over.
{83497}{83549}Three weeks later,
{83550}{83634}I received an e-mail|from Gunner Palace.
{83695}{83745}''Dear Mike,
{83747}{83796}it is my sad duty|to inform you
{83797}{83846}that First Lieutenant|Ben Colgan
{83847}{83907}has been killed in action.
{83908}{83964}He was killed while trying|to block the bridge
{83965}{84014}by the Abu Hanifa Mosque,
{84015}{84095}to catch a vehicle associated|with an RPG attack on our compound.
{84096}{84185}He died knowing that|you loved and respected him
{84186}{84276}for who he was|and what he was doing.
{84277}{84352}I know that you had|a special affinity for Ben.
{84353}{84438}We all mourn his loss.''
{84499}{84561}Ben's death was close to home.
{84562}{84624}He was from Seattle, like me.
{84625}{84674}I knew the kind of house|he grew up in,
{84675}{84724}the mountains he dreamt of.
{84725}{84787}He had two daughters.
{84788}{84838}Looking at my own daughter,
{84839}{84888}I couldn't think of his death,
{84889}{84940}only his life.
{85051}{85103}Just before Christmas
{85104}{85177}specialist Billie Grimes was|on the cover of ''Time'' magazine
{85177}{85231}with two other gunners
{85232}{85320}to represent the American soldier|as Person of the Year.
{85321}{85407}The next day,|Lieutenant Matt Saltz
{85407}{85509}and PFC Stuart Moore|were killed by an IED.
{85510}{85573}A war most thought|to be over
{85574}{85619}was just beginning.
{85748}{85797}And the tears|started flowing
{85798}{85841}As soon|as they called out roll
{85842}{85916}Can you all really expect us|to keep it under control?
{85917}{85976}What could you tell a man|who just saw his two friends die
{85977}{86027}Right before his eyes,|except sip on his gin?
{86028}{86114}Trying to drown out his hurt|and pain in a sea full of sorrow
{86115}{86180}Living only for the day|is the motto we follow.
{86281}{86346}I speak that real flow|after ringing alarms
{86347}{86416}This country needs us way more|than when we needed Saddam
{86417}{86490}We start out our day|by readjusting our sights
{86491}{86552}And checking out the damage|that happened from mortars last night
{86552}{86619}Yeah, I think the ICDC|is starting to snitch
{86620}{86688}Telling what goes where|and which places to hit
{86689}{86745}If they prove me otherwise,|no intent to be shady
{86746}{86807}I blame it on this war that|made me paranoid and crazy
{86808}{86859}But this ain't fact,|it's only theory
{86860}{86949}In my statements about the struggles,|stress and pain every day we facing
{86950}{87006}Trials and tribulations|daily we do
{87007}{87070}And not always this life's pain|we wash away in our pool
{87072}{87129}When we take a dip,|we try to stick to the script
{87130}{87194}But when those guns start|blazing and our friends get hit
{87195}{87270}That's when our hearts start racing|and our stomachs get woozy
{87272}{87314}'Cause for y'all,|this is just a show
{87352}{87426}But we live|in this movie.
{87672}{87761}''Captain Robert Brewer|listens as an Iraqi woman begs
{87762}{87840}for the release of her son|who's been taken into custody.''
{87841}{87926}''My son blew you guys up.
{87927}{87976}Will you please bring him|back to me?
{87977}{88026}He's a good guy.|He's really a good boy.
{88027}{88112}He only shot eight mortars at you.|It's not that bad, is it?''
{88787}{88866}Anytime we would ever stoop|to a level of taking it personal,
{88867}{88956}we end up putting ourselves in|the same shoes that the terrorists are.
{88957}{89007}We stay focused.
{89007}{89057}If anything, we say|take it personal,
{89058}{89107}that just gives you|a boost of adrenaline
{89108}{89150}to continue on|with the mission.
{89246}{89297}Coming up!
{89326}{89375}Coming in!
{89376}{89440}I didn't want to say anything|that was inappropriate.
{89441}{89490}Get in there.|Reach in there.
{89492}{89562}You see it?|Get down in there.
{89602}{89655}- Come on. No.|- No?
{89656}{89737}Bullshit. Yeah, you didn't go down|far enough in there.
{89738}{89804}Oh, dude!
{89805}{89877}Damn, this just gets|better and better.
{89878}{89931}Three RPG launchers.
{89932}{89987}You know how many years|in jail that is?
{89988}{90040}That is 30 years in jail.
{90041}{90090}We scored up here. RPGs.
{90091}{90140}Oh, that's what|I'm talking about.
{90141}{90194}You know what?|I gave you your chance.
{90195}{90261}All you had to tell me was,|''Yes, I know where some RPGs,''
{90262}{90320}and I would have let you go.
{90321}{90376}Well...
{90661}{90712}New cell phone?
{90713}{90795}God damn, these people|have money.
{90796}{90847}These are brand-new|cell phones.
{90848}{90908}Two, three, four, five, six.
{90909}{90959}You're the neighbor, right?
{91005}{91096}- No relationship, huh?|- Where's this coming from?
{91097}{91176}- This guy speaks English, by the way.|- Where's this?
{91177}{91227}Where's all this shit|coming from? Look at that.
{91228}{91294}- What do you think about that?|- I don't know.
{91295}{91339}You don't know?
{91378}{91427}He says, ''I'm a merchant.''
{91428}{91478}You're a merchant?
{91782}{91880}No, hell, I ain't|touching his feet.
{91881}{91930}Keep your|fucking eyes closed.
{91931}{91976}He doesn't have|any shoes.
{92463}{92532}When 2/3 leaves|the palace,
{92533}{92606}the ICDC will take over|security at Adhamiya.
{92607}{92687}The question is|if the insurgency grows,
{92688}{92741}will they stand and fight?
{93184}{93235}Go go.
{93340}{93392}Right there.
{93889}{93966}Y'all are looking|and sounding good this morning.
{93967}{94017}Give yourselves a hand.
{94097}{94165}From the AFRTS|news center in Washington,
{94166}{94216}this is|the ''Two-Minute Report.''
{94217}{94279}Defense Secretary|Donald Rumsfeld said Monday,
{94280}{94353}''The President's $87 billion|budget request
{94354}{94428}is an honest summary of what|it will cost the United States
{94429}{94495}to continue the War|on Terror in Iraq
{94496}{94545}and Afghanistan|for the next year.''
{94546}{94551}All these pieces where only|the paint is chipped off
{94551}{94609}All these pieces where only|the paint is chipped off
{94610}{94645}is where it hit the door.
{94646}{94691}But right here,
{94692}{94736}it went through here.
{94737}{94786}Right there.
{94787}{94851}All the way through into...|the glass that broke.
{94852}{94921}The friction that broke|the glass and came inside
{94922}{94966}cut his nose right here.
{94967}{95017}- Is he all right?|- Yeah, he's good.
{95017}{95131}Part of our $87 billion|budget provided for us
{95132}{95193}to have some|secondary armor
{95194}{95258}to put on top of our|thin-skinned Humvees.
{95259}{95322}This armor was made in Iraq
{95323}{95383}and is high-quality metal,
{95384}{95481}and it will probably|slow down the shrapnel
{95482}{95536}so that it stays in your body
{95537}{95587}instead of going clean through.
{95587}{95641}And that's about it.
{96011}{96079}Be strong without it,|when people finally see my pain
{96080}{96136}Switches lives|to see why we insane
{96137}{96181}We wearing clothes|a week in a row
{96182}{96233}This ain't a thug thing,|it's 'cause we're at war
{96234}{96283}Dark colors|to cover mud stains
{96284}{96326}The world's weight is starting|to weaken our back
{96327}{96393}Considered a ravenous beast|if we just launch an attack
{96394}{96467}Lose-Iose situation we face|in anticipation and hating
{96468}{96538}Although we hunted by Satan,|we're frustration abating
{96539}{96605}The situation we facing,|not only follow but chasing
{96606}{96681}Those moving with hatred,|that's why we feel so neglected
{96682}{96732}I'm protecting life|in the present
{96732}{96789}No need to like this,|but please respect it
{96790}{96839}This is life.
{97009}{97042}You're not gonna|hit me, are you?
{97042}{97058}You're not gonna|hit me, are you?
{97059}{97110}Nah, I'll stop-- fuck!
{97111}{97159}Man, calm your ass down.
{97160}{97209}What's the matter with you?
{97210}{97262}What happened?|Hey, give me some scissors.
{97263}{97326}That's a little tight,|isn't it?
{97327}{97357}Yes.
{97358}{97401}Last time I saw this guy,
{97402}{97470}he was taking prisoners.
{97471}{97520}Until a few weeks ago,
{97521}{97583}Mohammed Tyson was|a trusted member of Charlie Battery.
{97584}{97643}Now he's been accused|of identifying
{97644}{97710}and photographing targets|for the insurgents.
{97711}{97760}If it's true,
{97761}{97835}he's responsible for|at least three murders,
{97837}{97907}and he'll be sent|to Abu Ghraib Prison.
{97908}{97979}Nothing is black|and white here anymore.
{97980}{98055}Now do you want to be my guest,|or do you want to be my prisoner?
{98114}{98153}Fine.
{98154}{98212}Tyson, do you want to be my guest,|or do you want to be my prisoner?
{98213}{98250}What's all this?
{98251}{98317}- You wanna be my guest?|- Yeah, okay.
{98318}{98388}Relax, man.|I ain't cutting you.
{98389}{98460}I'm taking it off.|You're my guest.
{98461}{98502}You're my official guest.
{98503}{98534}Whatever you give it to him,
{98535}{98585}he will never|respect anything.
{98586}{98632}That's why Mohammed Tyson|is detained,
{98633}{98697}and he's going to be sentenced|to Abu Ghraib for 30 years.
{98723}{98796}That's it. It's easy.
{98797}{98846}One plus one equal two.
{98948}{98997}You're not gonna try|anything funny.
{98998}{99049}You'd have to get past|80 guys to get to the gate.
{99050}{99134}Super Cop and I started|to work about four months ago.
{99160}{99206}Yes.
{99207}{99266}We have an agreement.|We have to clean Adhamiya.
{99267}{99320}First of all,|this is our country.
{99321}{99382}And the second thing,|we want to live in peace.
{99383}{99445}So that's why we started|to work together.
{99447}{99505}He gather intel,|we go together
{99506}{99558}and then we arrest|the bad people.
{100044}{100138}...they started some|construction in my town,
{100139}{100237}Colorado Springs,|it's the Woodman and l-25 interchange.
{100237}{100331}I'm not really exactly sure what|the construction was for,
{100332}{100382}but I know they|had started it.
{100382}{100432}It was causing lots|of backups.
{100432}{100495}Now I dropped out|of high school,
{100497}{100546}then went back|to high school again,
{100547}{100626}and they're still working|on it and stuff.
{100627}{100696}After I dropped out|of high school again,
{100697}{100774}I didn't really do much|but a lot of drugs and drinking.
{100812}{100862}That got old.|I joined the army, right?
{100863}{100966}Then I'm in Germany|for a year just partying my ass off.
{100967}{101026}All of a sudden, the army slaps down|this deployment thing.
{101027}{101086}They're all like,|''You're going to war, right?''
{101087}{101205}So I go to war.|We destroy a country.
{101206}{101251}We rebuild a country.
{101252}{101302}Now I had gotten online
{101302}{101371}and looked at a Colorado Springs|newspaper the other day,
{101372}{101452}and one of the headlines was
{101453}{101567}''Woodman and l-25 Project|Has Some Progress.''
{101592}{101642}How do I go through all of that
{101642}{101697}and they have ''some'' progress?
{101698}{101774}Who knows? Maybe I'll|become president.
{101775}{101836}Sound good?
{102120}{102211}Our other vehicle just decided|to keep on fucking driving,
{102212}{102284}and not even bother to look back|to see if we were still there.
{102285}{102348}That was really|thoughtful of 'em.
{102349}{102409}Any station on this,|this is HB405.
{102410}{102450}Radio check, over.
{102451}{102500}The worst thing that|could happen?
{102501}{102550}Well, if you had diarrhea|right now,
{102551}{102608}that would probably suck|pretty fucking bad.
{102680}{102766}You know, there's lots of places|around here, if you look around,
{102767}{102852}someone could shoot|a fucking RPG at us.
{103017}{103071}This is not my country.
{103072}{103129}When I leave here,|I'm fucking gone.
{103297}{103345}They're here to get paid.
{103346}{103412}Soon as we leave, guess what|the fuck they're gonna do?
{103586}{103635}I'll hear about|this shit on the news.
{103636}{103686}I'm gonna feel like crap|because I tried to train 'em.
{103687}{103737}I tried to train 'em.|I tried to train 'em,
{103737}{103787}but I can't train someone|who doesn't give a shit.
{103787}{103856}- And this is yours, not mine.|- I know.
{103857}{103897}The Military Postal Service|agency is now processing
{103897}{103944}The Military Postal Service|agency is now processing
{103945}{104032}around 2 million Ibs.|of mail each week
{104033}{104082}for troops in Iraq|and Afghanistan.
{104083}{104176}Lieutenant Commander Brian Lomax,|chief of policy for the agency,
{104177}{104228}says all those letters|and packages
{104229}{104302}help keep service members|connected to home.
{104657}{104706}Yes.
{104707}{104761}Don't fucking move.
{104762}{104821}I don't know the rest|of the words.
{104822}{104874}Well, I'm trying this|new flavor of Easy Mac.
{104875}{104942}It's Tombstone Cheese Pizza.
{104943}{105018}Little curious.
{105019}{105082}That's what us imams do.|We're leaders.
{105083}{105145}We try and get things straight.
{105147}{105199}You know, make sure everything|works out nice and neat.
{105200}{105287}I gotta try something|before I let my people fall
{105288}{105321}into a big mistake.
{105322}{105372}Most imams|also speak Arabic.
{105372}{105444}I do the same.
{106173}{106225}It says...
{106445}{106490}''From national citizens.''
{106491}{106531}That means you.
{106532}{106570}Well, yes.
{106810}{106888}I got the no beer blues
{106889}{106942}Yes, I do
{106943}{107011}My blood system's dry
{107012}{107065}My brain's gonna fry
{107208}{107291}Yeah, I got|the no beer blues!
{108792}{108842}They believe that|we betrayed our country
{108842}{108927}because we work with the army,|and that's not true.
{108928}{108982}They are the real traitors,|and we are the good guys.
{108983}{109032}We know we are|the good guys
{109033}{109092}because we want to make|the new Iraq a good country,
{109093}{109142}a good Iraq country,
{109143}{109193}and they don't|want this to happen.
{109194}{109261}Because if this happens...
{109302}{109364}...and these people|can't live without war.
{109365}{109414}They've been|living in wars
{109415}{109464}from the beginning|of their lives.
{109465}{109546}And it's hard for them to change|and see everyone happy.
{109547}{109633}Everyone goes back,|sits with his children,
{109634}{109706}his wife, friends.
{109707}{109759}They say that's|too much for us.
{110252}{110321}Hey, what happened|this morning?
{110322}{110382}This morning...
{110383}{110482}the Shiites were having|their holy day,
{110483}{110549}doing their usual walks|around Baghdad
{110550}{110600}and their little pilgrimage
{110602}{110702}to some of the holy shrines|in the area.
{110703}{110752}And then went over|to Kadhimiya
{110753}{110829}and a couple explosions|went off.
{110830}{110910}Doctors at the hospital say
{110911}{110988}at least 75 people|were killed thus far.
{110989}{111087}When the QRF from|the nights and Dakota
{111087}{111141}went over to assess|the situation
{111142}{111198}and try to help|with medical support,
{111199}{111275}they got there only to be pelted|by rocks and sticks
{111276}{111377}and bottles and chairs and anything|Iraqis could pick up and throw.
{111378}{111440}It's been|a wonderful morning.
{111496}{111500}Listen up.
{111500}{111550}Listen up.
{111552}{111604}Hey, when we get out here,|we're not standing up.
{111605}{111669}Everybody gonna get down,|turn around and face out.
{111670}{111720}We gotta go up here|and check out this thing.
{111721}{111788}Here's the thing. We're going to|check out up here by the mosque.
{111789}{111864}There's supposed to be|some army up here that's armed.
{111865}{111920}We're going up here|to see how many it is.
{111921}{111980}We're gonna let the IPs know.|They're gonna disarm 'em.
{111981}{112059}If they don't disarm 'em, we go back|and disarm 'em ourselves. Understood?
{112060}{112101}All right.
{112329}{112376}Oh, shit.
{112377}{112426}Get down.
{112521}{112576}We got it.
{112577}{112626}IEDs are the scariest.
{112627}{112686}By far have got to be|the scariest.
{112687}{112746}Gunfire and crap like that,|that shit don't bother me.
{112747}{112783}You know, it's whatever,
{112784}{112855}But IEDs? They hide that shit|in the garbage, man.
{112856}{112951}This whole country's garbage.|Everything is just trash.
{112952}{113003}And it could be anywhere,|you know?
{113004}{113081}When we're going around corners, and|there's a box on the side of the road.
{113082}{113141}You know, cringe|and take the turn
{113142}{113192}and hopefully|you don't hear a bang.
{113501}{113571}...and AK-47##s|are standing over there.
{113572}{113619}The lieutenant is looking|for armed members
{113620}{113704}of Mahdi's army,|the Shia militia.
{113705}{113761}While not yet hostile|to the coalition,
{113762}{113833}they're growing in numbers.
{113867}{113916}The talk on the street|is civil war.
{113917}{113964}If it comes,
{113965}{114034}these soldiers|will be targeted
{114035}{114097}by every faction.
{114387}{114437}I don't care|what anybody says.
{114437}{114517}There's peaceful places in Iraq,|but this ain't one of them.
{114518}{114586}Know that anybody|who's been here has lived it,
{114587}{114637}seen it and done it.
{114637}{114714}They've done their job.
{118007}{118063}You too!|Get on the fucking ground!
{118064}{118154}- Get on the fucking ground!|- Get the fuck down!
{118618}{118692}Yeah, they're gonna|sit down...
{118920}{119010}All right, get your hands up.|These the bad guys?
{119187}{119236}Two coming out!
{119465}{119526}Gentlemen, I'm sorry for|the inconvenience tonight.
{119584}{119638}But it's necessary|for the security of Iraq.
{119692}{119742}We have who we're|looking for right now.
{119797}{119852}We'll try to make it|short, quick and painless.
{120289}{120363}Well, it's been interesting,|this last year.
{120364}{120415}It's a once|in a lifetime chance
{120416}{120461}to live|in a bombed-out palace
{120462}{120506}and then make|the most of it.
{120507}{120583}I definitely won't have ceilings|as high as this probably ever again
{120584}{120646}or chandeliers as many|as I'm living under right now,
{120647}{120715}but it's the right thing|to do to give it back
{120716}{120765}to the Iraqi people.
{120766}{120866}And we're all looking back to going back|to Giessen, Germany.
{120867}{120912}There's still a lot|of mission between now
{120913}{120975}and the time we do that,|and we have some definable goals
{120976}{121031}that we want to get accomplished|before we leave.
{121106}{121191}When you sit and watch TV,|and you go to your 9:00 to 5:00 job,
{121192}{121250}and you complain|about the pizza being late,
{121251}{121300}there's no way you're|gonna know how we live here.
{121302}{121351}Someone being|sympathetic to this,
{121352}{121410}I don't even know if I'd be sympathetic|if I wasn't in the army.
{121411}{121460}After you watch this,
{121461}{121522}you're gonna go get|your popcorn out of the microwave
{121523}{121577}and talk about what I say.
{121627}{121680}And you'll forget me|by the end of this.
{121722}{121777}You'll forget all of this.
{121828}{121896}Only people who will|remember this is us.
{122006}{122083}I don't think|anywhere in history
{122084}{122134}has somebody killed|somebody else
{122135}{122194}and something better|has come out of it.
{122225}{122279}It's just not possible.
{122426}{122481}I couldn't even answer|that question.
{122577}{122628}There's not really|any rationalization
{122629}{122715}behind someone's|child dying.
{122847}{122893}I don't think it's...
{122925}{123001}worth the death|of someone's family member.
{123738}{123791}Okay.
{123792}{123837}Turn left.
{123838}{123896}I flew home to Germany|on a MedEvac,
{123897}{123964}surrounded|by wounded soldiers.
{124052}{124109}Three weeks later,
{124110}{124160}fighting erupted in Adhamiya.
{124307}{124357}Unlike a movie,
{124357}{124417}war has no end.
{127053}{127126}Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord.
{127127}{127191}You ain't nobody, chief,|so stay on guard.
{127192}{127232}Nobody loves you!
{127233}{127298}I'll be back soon, honey.|Don't worry about it.
{127299}{127366}I love you, man!
{127367}{127426}Oh, Lord, he might|throw me off the vehicle.
{127427}{127474}I love you!
{127475}{127583}Gunner, you're always invited.
{127584}{127646}You know that.|That's right.
{127647}{127735}Gunner Palace, basically,|an adult's paradise.
