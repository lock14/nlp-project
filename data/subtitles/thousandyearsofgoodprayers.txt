We once had a brain that we

Sir, have you ever thought
about finding answers
to all the questions
you have?
America

No good to stomach.
Stomach?
Sir, have you ever heard
of the prophet Joseph Smith?
Or of this book,
the Book of Mormon?
Joseph Smith brought the
Book of Mormon to the world
and we believe it
to be
the most correct book
on the earth.
Uh...
"awake, my sons.
Put on the armor
of righteousness.
Shake off the chains
with which you are bound
and come forth
out of obscurity
and arise
from the dust."
What it means is
this is a prophet
and he is talking
to his sons.
And he's telling them
to break--
break out of the chains,
to be strong.
To stand up.
Workers in the world,
come together.
You free.
You have world.
You know who said this?
No, I'm afraid not, sir.
Marx, Engels.
You too young.
Is he a Chinese wise man?
Yes, clever.
Sir, there are
many wise sayings
by many wise people,
but what we seek
to learn,
what helps us
answer the questions
we have
are the words
of the prophets of God.
I not know
your god.
China no have god.
That's why we're here
talking to you, sir.
Yes yes.
Do you have any questions?
Questions many many.

Hello there.
How do you do?
Can I help you?
I looking something.
Take your time.
I have a feeling
I have here in my store
Exactly what you're
looking for.
So what are you
looking for?
Present-- my daughter.
Something old,
very old.
I see.
How about this?
A friend of mine has a
trading post in Montana.
His great-grandfather
used this knife
in Custer's last stand.
Have you ever been
to the museum in Montana?
You see, Custer stood
maybe about that tall.
He had little feet--
Sorry.
Something good luck.
I see.
Now I get you.
What about this--
Good luck
for Native Americans?
Good luck American.
Native Americans.
American Indians.
These bears
were very special
and thought to possess
magic powers.
The spirit of the bear--
very good luck, see?
I can find the tribal
certificate if you want to see.
Forget the certificate.
Take my word,
it's one of a kind.
Is this old?
Well, honestly,
maybe it's not
that old
but if you want something
from 300 years ago,
you need to pay
big bucks.
And this conceptually
is as old as
a 300-year-old piece.
Hello?
- Dad.
Oh, Yilan.
Hello.
 No one is available to take your call.
Please leave a message
after the tone.
Yilan...
Wei?
Good morning.
I go here.
Oh, I'm going downtown and I can
transfer you to the right bus.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Sir, your I.D., please.
I look--
I'm sorry, sir,
this facility
is only for
the college community.
She work here, library.
My daughter.
My daughter work--
I'm sorry, sir,
but this facility
is for law students and
college community only.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm father.
Hello.
Madam okay?
Grandson okay?
Madam fine.
Grandson fine.
She wasn't going to the
hospital to see her grandson.
I moved her into
the retirement home.
Retire home?
Old people home.
Old people
home.
Madam big son,
doctor--
she say
he take care madam.
Big house.
Not anymore.
Him and his wife--
they don't want madam
to take care
of their baby.
Yilan...
Yilan...
- Mister manager.
- Yes, sir.
Uh, more bus?
No, sir, that was
the last one for tonight.
My daughter no home.
I wait.
The least she could have
done was giving you a call
And saying that she'd either
be out late with friends
- Or working late.
- Yes yes.
I spent 11 years
with the C.I.A.,
so when my kids would
take off for a little while
I always knew
where they were,
or at least
I thought I did.
C.I.A.?
Mm-hmm, yes, I was
with them 11 years.
But, you know, our kids
worry us all the time.
We feed them. We clothe
them. We love them.
And then they turn
around and they bite us.
I worry.
I worry.
Well, that's all we
can do as a parent,
is worry and hope,
you know?
Hope good.
Hope good.
I'll have to agree
with you there.
You know,
when she gets home
sit down and have a
little talk with her.
And if that doesn't work, give
her a swift kick in the shins.
Good night, sir.
You have a good evening.
Oh, good.
Thank you.
You know, in China
we have an old saying--
What does it mean?
"It takes 300 years
of prayers
to cross a river
in a boat with someone.
It takes 3,000 years
of prayers
to share a pillow
with someone."
How many prayers
did we say?
Not enough for us to
become husband and wife.
You know,
you probably
should work
on getting your wife and
daughter to come to America.
I'll see if I can get
another Russian class
to T.A. next semester.
You may think
how much money you make
is important
to your daughter,
but maybe
you just don't know
girls as daughters.
And someday
before it's too late
you may want to explain
something to her--
something about love,
men,
and all the things that
her mother doesn't know.
I'm perfectly fine.
Yilan...
# I waved to you #
# as my boat
was leaving #
# hats flew up #
# and everybody cheered #
# but you turned #
# as I guess
someone spoke to you #
# and in a sea
of arms #
# you disappeared #
# I live a life #
# of a ragged soldier #
# the secretary #
# to a rebel king #
# he kept us
drunk and hungry #
# in a jungle #
# tangled in the lilies #
# of his scheme #
# we gambled #
# and we fought
with one another #
# we had no Code #
# to give us unity #
# most died among us #
# without god or honor #
# as blood became #
# our faith and currency #
# but all the while #
# I kept your name
beside me #
# I wrote it #
# but refused it
on my tongue #
# believing you a song #
# still there
inside me #
# I feared your loss #
# if ever it was sung #
# I found myself
at last #
# on a shoreline #
# I booked
my passage home #
# and stood in tears #
# with a bag of apples #
# and a forged passport #
# the first I'd seen
my face #
# in seven years #
# now I wonder
at the day #
# when I might
find you #
# appear
among the living #
# at your door #
# will you have
a husband #
# and some children? #
# will we
share a secret #
# anymore? #
# oh, life is brutal #
# to the weak
and sober #
# its powers
of persuasion #
# dark and grey #
# it pushes
its way up #
# to the railing #
# and it turns
its face #
# as you start
to wave. #
