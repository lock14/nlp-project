00:01:23,732 --> 00:01:26,300
This is the rocket scientist

00:01:26,301 --> 00:01:28,069

00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,817
Old stories.
I'm retired.

8
00:01:42,818 --> 00:01:45,987
Well, you have a
wonderful visit in America.

00:01:45,988 --> 00:01:49,523

00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,078
Good afternoon, sir.

16
00:17:12,146 --> 00:17:14,114
Hello?

Good morning.

19
00:18:57,652 --> 00:18:59,586
Good morning.

20
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:25,095
<i>What are you writing?</i>

21
00:19:25,096 --> 00:19:26,797
Nothing.

22
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,367
Well, it's a beautiful day.

23
00:19:30,368 --> 00:19:33,470
Uh, yes.

24
00:19:33,471 --> 00:19:35,572
Uh...

00:19:41,395 --> 00:19:43,596
You no work yesterday.

27
00:19:43,597 --> 00:19:45,632
Good.

28
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:48,384
<i>Yeah, well, I'm unemployed</i>
<i>at the moment.</i>

29
00:19:48,385 --> 00:19:50,587
<i>I can't seem</i>
<i>to find a job.</i>

30
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:52,555
What you do?

31
00:19:52,556 --> 00:19:55,325
Oh, well, I studied to be
a forensic scientist.

32
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:57,544
- Scientist?
- <i>Yeah. </i> Uh-huh.

33
00:19:57,545 --> 00:19:59,680
Oh, good good.

34
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:03,149
I scientist--

35
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,585
Oh my God,

00:20:05,586 --> 00:20:07,353
That is so cool.

I want to be
a forensic scientist.

38
00:20:10,124 --> 00:20:13,376
Have you ever been
in a cadaver lab?

39
00:20:13,377 --> 00:20:16,313
It's very peaceful.
It's very peaceful.

40
00:20:16,314 --> 00:20:19,516
We once had a brain that we
sliced up like a loaf of bread--

41
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:22,620
Well, pretty much everything
sliced up for our convenience.

42
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,956
A lot of people think
I'm weird and morbid,

43
00:20:25,957 --> 00:20:28,792
but I think I have a very
sunny outlook on things.

44
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:30,794
Oh, yes,
you like sun.

45
00:20:30,795 --> 00:20:32,896
- Uh-huh. Yes.
- Good good.

46
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:35,365
Uh, goodbye.

Good weather.

50
00:21:02,276 --> 00:21:04,244
Uh...

51
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:27,000
Ci-cah-das.

52
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:30,203

Good.

91
00:24:44,498 --> 00:24:47,099
You look like you're a little
worried about something.

Are you okay?

93
00:24:49,937 --> 00:24:52,638

Stomach?

99
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:16,012
Sir, have you ever heard
of the prophet Joseph Smith?

100
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:23,153
<i>Or of this book,</i>
<i>the Book of Mormon?</i>

101
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,641
Joseph Smith brought the
Book of Mormon to the world

102
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:30,643
and we believe it
to be

103
00:25:30,644 --> 00:25:34,347
the most correct book
on the earth.

104

out of obscurity

109

- Yes yes.
- Yes?

192
00:36:46,152 --> 00:36:47,570
Me?

193
00:36:47,571 --> 00:36:49,371
Thank you.

194
00:36:52,242 --> 00:36:56,378
I love America.

195
00:36:56,379 --> 00:37:00,283
My son,

196
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:02,685
big son,

197
00:37:02,686 --> 00:37:06,889
here-- doctor.

198
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:11,994
Good life.

199
00:37:11,995 --> 00:37:14,897
Good car.

200
00:37:14,898 --> 00:37:16,899
Good house.

201
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,403
All America.

202
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,776
You have son-- good.

203
00:37:31,331 --> 00:37:33,799
My daughter

204
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,935
close to mama.

205
00:37:36,936 --> 00:37:40,372
I make rocket.

206
00:37:40,373 --> 00:37:42,040
We no talk.

207
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,407
I-- no good father.

208
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:27,236
"Seeking."

209
00:38:31,341 --> 00:38:36,512
"Men seeking men."

210
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:48,991
"Women seeking women."

211
00:39:58,395 --> 00:40:00,696
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>Oh, hi.</i>

212
00:40:08,088 --> 00:40:11,590
Well, if every child did the
right thing with the parent,

213
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:14,693
We would lose half of our
traditional Chinese literature.

214
00:40:18,164 --> 00:40:20,165
Yes, you're right.

215
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:22,601
Yeah, I'll try.

216
00:40:22,602 --> 00:40:25,838
All right, I'll see you
in a little bit, okay?

217
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,307
Bye.

218
00:43:50,276 --> 00:43:52,511
I need go.

219
00:43:55,247 --> 00:43:58,016
You come.
I know here.

220
00:43:58,017 --> 00:44:00,586
You sorry.
I sorry.

221
00:44:00,587 --> 00:44:02,521
Oh.

222
00:44:06,993 --> 00:44:09,862
Baby son.
Son baby son come.

223
00:44:09,863 --> 00:44:11,697
Oh.

224
00:44:11,698 --> 00:44:14,065
- Son have son.
- Son have son.

225
00:44:14,066 --> 00:44:17,135
Baby son.
Grandson.

226
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:23,408
Grandmama.

227
00:44:23,409 --> 00:44:25,410
Where grandson?

228
00:44:25,411 --> 00:44:27,412
Hospital.

229
00:44:27,413 --> 00:44:29,548
I go hospital.

230
00:44:29,549 --> 00:44:31,850
Where you go?

231
00:44:31,851 --> 00:44:34,786
Friend,
my friend drive.

232
00:44:34,787 --> 00:44:36,388
Oh, no.

233
00:44:36,389 --> 00:44:39,257
I take bus.
How do you do, madam?

234
00:44:39,258 --> 00:44:41,259
Hello, sir.

235
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:53,556
Sit.

236
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:00,513
I must tell to you
something.

237
00:45:09,322 --> 00:45:13,025
I had daughter.

238
00:45:13,026 --> 00:45:16,261
Where?

239
00:45:16,262 --> 00:45:18,263
In Iran.

240
00:45:18,264 --> 00:45:19,431
Not here?

241
00:45:19,432 --> 00:45:21,433
No, not here.

242
00:45:21,434 --> 00:45:25,704
She died in Iran.

243
00:45:25,705 --> 00:45:27,973
Look look.

244
00:45:31,477 --> 00:45:33,412
Beautiful.

245
00:45:40,787 --> 00:45:43,088
War.

246
00:45:43,089 --> 00:45:45,591
Eight years war.

247
00:45:45,592 --> 00:45:48,944
Two crazy men--

248
00:45:48,945 --> 00:45:52,481
Lose daughter.
Lose daughter.

249
00:46:10,116 --> 00:46:12,751
Sad story.

250
00:46:17,223 --> 00:46:21,126
You look good side.

251
00:46:21,127 --> 00:46:24,095
You two sons.

252
00:46:24,096 --> 00:46:27,299
You baby grandson.

253
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,001
You grandmama.

254
00:46:32,004 --> 00:46:34,773
You good.
You good.

255
00:46:34,774 --> 00:46:36,742
Eh?

256
00:47:05,137 --> 00:47:07,539
<i>Hello there.</i>

257
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,541
How do you do?

258
00:47:09,542 --> 00:47:11,543
Can I help you?

259
00:47:11,544 --> 00:47:14,279
I looking something.

260
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,715
Take your time.

261
00:47:16,716 --> 00:47:18,917
I have a feeling
I have here in my store

262
00:47:18,918 --> 00:47:21,353
Exactly what you're
looking for.

263
00:47:21,354 --> 00:47:23,822
So what are you
looking for?

264
00:47:27,092 --> 00:47:31,596
Present-- my daughter.

265
00:47:31,597 --> 00:47:35,300
Something old,
very old.

266
00:47:35,301 --> 00:47:38,170
I see.

267
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:40,605
<i>How about this?</i>

268
00:47:40,606 --> 00:47:43,542
<i>A friend of mine has a
trading post in Montana.</i>

269
00:47:43,543 --> 00:47:47,028
His great-grandfather
used this knife

270
00:47:47,029 --> 00:47:48,497
in Custer's last stand.

271
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:51,900
Have you ever been
to the museum in Montana?

272
00:47:51,901 --> 00:47:56,839
You see, Custer stood
maybe about that tall.

273
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,342
He had little feet--

274
00:48:00,343 --> 00:48:04,479
Sorry.

275
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,582
Something good luck.

276
00:48:09,135 --> 00:48:11,603
I see.

277
00:48:11,604 --> 00:48:14,006
Now I get you.

278
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,815
What about this--

279
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:26,585
Good luck
for Native Americans?

280
00:48:26,586 --> 00:48:29,287
Good luck American.

281
00:48:29,288 --> 00:48:32,524
Native Americans.
American Indians.

282
00:48:33,843 --> 00:48:36,561
These bears
were very special

283
00:48:36,562 --> 00:48:39,397
and thought to possess
magic powers.

284
00:48:39,398 --> 00:48:43,202
The spirit of the bear--
very good luck, see?

285
00:48:45,037 --> 00:48:47,973
I can find the tribal
certificate if you want to see.

286
00:48:51,077 --> 00:48:54,012
Forget the certificate.

287
00:48:54,013 --> 00:48:56,965
Take my word,
it's one of a kind.

288
00:48:56,966 --> 00:48:59,234
Is this old?

289
00:48:59,235 --> 00:49:03,288
Well, honestly,

290
00:49:03,289 --> 00:49:05,724
maybe it's not
that old

291
00:49:05,725 --> 00:49:08,693
but if you want something
from 300 years ago,

292
00:49:08,694 --> 00:49:10,929
you need to pay
big bucks.

293
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:13,632
And this conceptually

294
00:49:13,633 --> 00:49:17,002
is as old as
a 300-year-old piece.

295
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,701
<i>Hello?</i>
- <i>Dad.</i>

296
00:49:32,702 --> 00:53:12,420
<i>Oh, Yilan.</i>

297
00:53:20,746 --> 00:53:24,249
<i>Hello.
</i> No one is available to take your call.</i>

298
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:26,585
<i>Please leave a message</i>
<i>after the tone.</i>

299
00:53:33,726 --> 00:53:35,660
Yilan...

300
00:53:42,801 --> 00:53:44,736
<i>Wei?</i>

301
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:09,978
Good morning.

302
00:54:09,979 --> 00:54:11,780
I go here.

303
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:15,049
Oh, I'm going downtown and I can
transfer you to the right bus.

304
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:17,018
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

305
00:55:15,928 --> 00:55:17,728
Sir, your I.D., please.

306
00:55:20,032 --> 00:55:22,033
I look--

307
00:55:24,637 --> 00:55:26,671
I'm sorry, sir,
this facility

308
00:55:26,672 --> 00:55:29,240
is only for
the college community.

309
00:55:31,343 --> 00:55:35,613
She work here, library.

310
00:55:35,614 --> 00:55:39,066
My daughter.
My daughter work--

311
00:55:39,067 --> 00:55:41,969
I'm sorry, sir,
but this facility

312
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:45,973
is for law students and
college community only.

313
00:55:49,011 --> 00:55:50,978
I'm sorry.

314
00:55:55,584 --> 00:55:58,787
Okay.
Okay.

315
00:56:33,755 --> 00:56:35,791
I'm father.

316
00:56:40,763 --> 00:56:43,665
Hello.

317
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,303
Madam okay?

318
00:56:49,304 --> 00:56:51,305
Grandson okay?

319
00:56:51,306 --> 00:56:54,142
<i>Madam fine.</i>
<i>Grandson fine.</i>

320
00:56:54,143 --> 00:56:58,013
She wasn't going to the
hospital to see her grandson.

321
00:57:00,149 --> 00:57:02,450
I moved her into
the retirement home.

322
00:57:02,451 --> 00:57:05,753
Retire home?

323
00:57:05,754 --> 00:57:09,106
Old people home.

324
00:57:09,107 --> 00:57:13,645
Old people
home.

325
00:57:13,646 --> 00:57:16,113
Madam big son,

326
00:57:16,114 --> 00:57:19,984
doctor--

327
00:57:19,985 --> 00:57:24,522
she say
he take care madam.

328
00:57:24,523 --> 00:57:26,524
Big house.

329
00:57:26,525 --> 00:57:28,793
<i>Not anymore.</i>

330
00:57:28,794 --> 00:57:31,796
Him and his wife--
they don't want madam

331
00:57:31,797 --> 00:57:34,966
to take care
of their baby.

332
00:58:23,415 --> 00:58:25,349
Yilan...

333
00:58:40,065 --> 00:58:42,032
Yilan...

334
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:05,717
- Mister manager.
- Yes, sir.

335
01:00:05,718 --> 01:00:08,653
Uh, more bus?

336
01:00:08,654 --> 01:00:11,155
No, sir, that was
the last one for tonight.

337
01:00:11,156 --> 01:00:14,959
My daughter no home.

338
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,061
I wait.

339
01:00:19,698 --> 01:00:22,133
The least she could have
done was giving you a call

340
01:00:22,134 --> 01:00:24,201
And saying that she'd either
be out late with friends

341
01:00:24,202 --> 01:00:26,036
- Or working late.
- Yes yes.

342
01:00:26,037 --> 01:00:28,272
I spent 11 years
with the C.I.A.,

343
01:00:28,273 --> 01:00:30,541
so when my kids would
take off for a little while

344
01:00:30,542 --> 01:00:32,543
I always knew
where they were,

345
01:00:32,544 --> 01:00:34,211
or at least
I thought I did.

346
01:00:34,212 --> 01:00:36,213
C.I.A.?

347
01:00:36,214 --> 01:00:39,350
Mm-hmm, yes, I was
with them 11 years.

348
01:00:39,351 --> 01:00:42,870
But, you know, our kids
worry us all the time.

349
01:00:42,871 --> 01:00:44,805
We feed them. We clothe
them. We love them.

350
01:00:44,806 --> 01:00:46,874
And then they turn
around and they bite us.

351
01:00:46,875 --> 01:00:48,776
I worry.
I worry.

352
01:00:48,777 --> 01:00:50,945
Well, that's all we
can do as a parent,

353
01:00:50,946 --> 01:00:53,114
is worry and hope,
you know?

354
01:00:53,115 --> 01:00:56,618
Hope good.
Hope good.

355
01:01:00,939 --> 01:01:02,774
I'll have to agree
with you there.

356
01:01:02,775 --> 01:01:04,409
You know,
when she gets home

357
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,210
sit down and have a
little talk with her.

358
01:01:06,211 --> 01:01:09,079
And if that doesn't work, give
her a swift kick in the shins.

359
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,981
Good night, sir.
You have a good evening.

360
01:01:10,982 --> 01:01:13,484
Oh, good.
Thank you.

361
01:02:20,669 --> 01:02:22,803
<i>You know, in China</i>

362
01:02:22,804 --> 01:02:25,473
<i>we have an old saying--</i>

363
01:02:33,865 --> 01:02:36,234
What does it mean?

364
01:02:39,738 --> 01:02:42,206
"It takes 300 years
of prayers

365
01:02:42,207 --> 01:02:46,744
to cross a river
in a boat with someone.

366
01:02:46,745 --> 01:02:49,913
It takes 3,000 years
of prayers

367
01:02:49,914 --> 01:02:52,182
to share a pillow
with someone."

368
01:02:54,586 --> 01:02:57,622
How many prayers
did we say?

369
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:04,962
Not enough for us to
become husband and wife.

370
01:03:21,263 --> 01:03:23,481
You know,

371
01:03:23,482 --> 01:03:25,549
you probably
should work

372
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:28,552
on getting your wife and
daughter to come to America.

373
01:03:33,258 --> 01:03:35,660
I'll see if I can get
another Russian class

374
01:03:35,661 --> 01:03:38,095
to T.A. next semester.

375
01:03:43,669 --> 01:03:46,704
You may think
how much money you make

376
01:03:46,705 --> 01:03:50,675
is important
to your daughter,

377
01:03:50,676 --> 01:03:53,077
but maybe

378
01:03:53,078 --> 01:03:55,847
you just don't know
girls as daughters.

379
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:02,720
And someday

380
01:04:02,721 --> 01:04:06,824
before it's too late

381
01:04:06,825 --> 01:04:09,661
you may want to explain
something to her--

382
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:14,932
something about love,

383
01:04:14,933 --> 01:04:17,869
men,

384
01:04:17,870 --> 01:04:21,172
and all the things that
her mother doesn't know.

385
01:07:57,272 --> 01:07:58,973
I'm perfectly fine.

386
01:14:10,478 --> 01:14:12,412
<i>Yilan...</i>

387
01:19:52,136 --> 01:19:54,671
<i># I waved to you #</i>

388
01:19:54,672 --> 01:19:57,640
<i># as my boat</i>
<i>was leaving #</i>

389
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:01,595
<i># hats flew up #</i>

390
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:04,214
<i># and everybody cheered #</i>

391
01:20:05,416 --> 01:20:07,084
<i># but you turned #</i>

392
01:20:07,085 --> 01:20:10,520
<i># as I guess</i>
<i>someone spoke to you #</i>

393
01:20:11,990 --> 01:20:14,624
<i># and in a sea</i>
<i>of arms #</i>

394
01:20:14,625 --> 01:20:17,527
<i># you disappeared #</i>

395
01:20:17,528 --> 01:20:20,263
<i># I live a life #</i>

396
01:20:20,264 --> 01:20:22,932
<i># of a ragged soldier #</i>

397
01:20:24,735 --> 01:20:26,736
<i># the secretary #</i>

398
01:20:26,737 --> 01:20:30,740
<i># to a rebel king #</i>

399
01:20:30,741 --> 01:20:33,610
<i># he kept us</i>
<i>drunk and hungry #</i>

400
01:20:33,611 --> 01:20:37,147
<i># in a jungle #</i>

401
01:20:37,148 --> 01:20:40,283
<i># tangled in the lilies #</i>

402
01:20:40,284 --> 01:20:43,686
<i># of his scheme #</i>

403
01:20:43,687 --> 01:20:45,422
<i># we gambled #</i>

404
01:20:45,423 --> 01:20:48,725
<i># and we fought</i>
<i>with one another #</i>

405
01:20:50,395 --> 01:20:52,095
<i># we had no Code #</i>

406
01:20:52,096 --> 01:20:56,500
<i># to give us unity #</i>

407
01:20:56,501 --> 01:20:58,801
<i># most died among us #</i>

408
01:20:58,802 --> 01:21:02,756
<i># without god or honor #</i>

409
01:21:02,757 --> 01:21:04,758
<i># as blood became #</i>

410
01:21:04,759 --> 01:21:08,929
<i># our faith and currency #</i>

411
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:11,331
<i># but all the while #</i>

412
01:21:11,332 --> 01:21:15,602
<i># I kept your name</i>
<i>beside me #</i>

413
01:21:15,603 --> 01:21:17,270
<i># I wrote it #</i>

414
01:21:17,271 --> 01:21:21,942
<i># but refused it</i>
<i>on my tongue #</i>

415
01:21:21,943 --> 01:21:24,578
<i># believing you a song #</i>

416
01:21:24,579 --> 01:21:28,748
<i># still there</i>
<i>inside me #</i>

417
01:21:28,749 --> 01:21:30,584
<i># I feared your loss #</i>

418
01:21:30,585 --> 01:21:35,288
<i># if ever it was sung #</i>

419
01:21:35,289 --> 01:21:37,924
<i># I found myself</i>
<i>at last #</i>

420
01:21:37,925 --> 01:21:41,495
<i># on a shoreline #</i>

421
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:44,598
<i># I booked</i>
<i>my passage home #</i>

422
01:21:44,599 --> 01:21:47,734
<i># and stood in tears #</i>

423
01:21:47,735 --> 01:21:50,169
<i># with a bag of apples #</i>

424
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:54,140
<i># and a forged passport #</i>

425
01:21:54,141 --> 01:21:57,310
<i># the first I'd seen</i>
<i>my face #</i>

426
01:21:57,311 --> 01:22:01,064
<i># in seven years #</i>

427
01:22:04,201 --> 01:22:06,602
<i># now I wonder</i>
<i>at the day #</i>

428
01:22:06,603 --> 01:22:10,673
<i># when I might</i>
<i>find you #</i>

429
01:22:10,674 --> 01:22:13,476
<i># appear</i>
<i>among the living #</i>

430
01:22:13,477 --> 01:22:17,113
<i># at your door #</i>

431
01:22:17,114 --> 01:22:19,515
<i># will you have</i>
<i>a husband #</i>

432
01:22:19,516 --> 01:22:23,519
<i># and some children? #</i>

433
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,456
<i># will we</i>
<i>share a secret #</i>

434
01:22:26,457 --> 01:22:29,459
<i># anymore? #</i>

435
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:31,461
<i># oh, life is brutal #</i>

436
01:22:31,462 --> 01:22:35,966
<i># to the weak</i>
<i>and sober #</i>

437
01:22:35,967 --> 01:22:38,835
<i># its powers</i>
<i>of persuasion #</i>

438
01:22:38,836 --> 01:22:42,472
<i># dark and grey #</i>

439
01:22:42,473 --> 01:22:45,141
<i># it pushes</i>
<i>its way up #</i>

440
01:22:45,142 --> 01:22:48,578
<i># to the railing #</i>

441
01:22:48,579 --> 01:22:51,081
<i># and it turns</i>
<i>its face #</i>

442
01:22:51,082 --> 01:22:55,352
<i># as you start</i>
<i>to wave. #</i>

443
