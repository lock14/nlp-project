<i>Hello there.</i>



How do you do?



Can I help you?

Take your time.



I have a feeling
I have here in my store



Exactly what you're
looking for.



So what are you
looking for?



Present-- my daughter.



Something old,
very old.



I see.



<i>How about this?</i>



<i>A friend of mine has a
trading post in Montana.</i>



His great-grandfather
used this knife



in Custer's last stand.



Have you ever been
to the museum in Montana?



You see, Custer stood
maybe about that tall.



He had little feet--



Sorry.



Something good luck.



I see.



Now I get you.



What about this--



Good luck
for Native Americans?



Good luck American.



Native Americans.
American Indians.



These bears
were very special



and thought to possess
magic powers.



The spirit of the bear--
very good luck, see?



I can find the tribal
certificate if you want to see.



Forget the certificate.



Take my word,
it's one of a kind.



Is this old?



Well, honestly,



maybe it's not
that old



but if you want something
from 300 years ago,



you need to pay
big bucks.



And this conceptually



is as old as
a 300-year-old piece.



<i>Hello?</i>
- <i>Dad.</i>



<i>Oh, Yilan.</i>



<i>Hello.
</i> No one is available to take your call.</i>



<i>Please leave a message</i>
<i>after the tone.</i>



Yilan...



<i>Wei?</i>



Good morning.



I go here.



Oh, I'm going downtown and I can
transfer you to the right bus.



- Thank you.
- Thank you.



Sir, your I.D., please.



I look--



I'm sorry, sir,
this facility



is only for
the college community.



She work here, library.



My daughter.
My daughter work--



I'm sorry, sir,
but this facility



is for law students and
college community only.



I'm sorry.



Okay.
Okay.



I'm father.



Hello.



Madam okay?



Grandson okay?



<i>Madam fine.</i>
<i>Grandson fine.</i>



She wasn't going to the
hospital to see her grandson.



I moved her into
the retirement home.



Retire home?



Old people home.



Old people
home.



Madam big son,



doctor--



she say
he take care madam.



Big house.



<i>Not anymore.</i>



Him and his wife--
they don't want madam



to take care
of their baby.



Yilan...



Yilan...



- Mister manager.
- Yes, sir.



Uh, more bus?



No, sir, that was
the last one for tonight.



My daughter no home.



I wait.



The least she could have
done was giving you a call



And saying that she'd either
be out late with friends



- Or working late.
- Yes yes.



I spent 11 years
with the C.I.A.,



so when my kids would
take off for a little while



I always knew
where they were,



or at least
I thought I did.



C.I.A.?



Mm-hmm, yes, I was
with them 11 years.



But, you know, our kids
worry us all the time.



We feed them. We clothe
them. We love them.



And then they turn
around and they bite us.



I worry.
I worry.



Well, that's all we
can do as a parent,



is worry and hope,
you know?



Hope good.
Hope good.



I'll have to agree
with you there.



You know,
when she gets home



sit down and have a
little talk with her.



And if that doesn't work, give
her a swift kick in the shins.



Good night, sir.
You have a good evening.



Oh, good.
Thank you.



<i>You know, in China</i>



<i>we have an old saying--</i>



What does it mean?



"It takes 300 years
of prayers



to cross a river
in a boat with someone.



It takes 3,000 years
of prayers



to share a pillow
with someone."



How many prayers
did we say?



Not enough for us to
become husband and wife.



You know,



you probably
should work



on getting your wife and
daughter to come to America.



I'll see if I can get
another Russian class



to T.A. next semester.



You may think
how much money you make



is important
to your daughter,



but maybe



you just don't know
girls as daughters.



And someday



before it's too late



you may want to explain
something to her--



something about love,



men,



and all the things that
her mother doesn't know.



I'm perfectly fine.

<i># I live a life #</i>



<i># of a ragged soldier #</i>
