1
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,920
Arthur?

2
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,440
where's he gone to this time?

3
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,440
And the dog's disappeared too!

4
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,240
Alfred!?!

5
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,760
Oh yes, you'll see, he be a great guard dog!

6
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,560
Alfred!
I wonder what exactly it is he'll be guarding!

7
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,000
If you could at least answer when I call!

8
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,320
Arthur...?

9
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:01,760
Arthur?!

10
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,640
Help! An attack!

11
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,520
Men, come to my aid!

12
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,160
Calm down!

13
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,360
It's me! Granny!

14
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,600
Sorry! I was in Africa!

15
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,920
I can tell! Did you have a good trip?

16
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,040
Fantastic...! I was in a tribe with Granpa!
Look!

17
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,400
Grandpa painted a canvas
that he placed in a circle

18
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,200
that way the animals pace round and round it

19
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,120
but can't find us. It's like we're invisible.

20
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,960
Invisible, but not unsmelable!
Did you have your bath this morning?

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,480
I was on my way when I found this book!

22
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,000
Hmm hmm!

23
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,960
It's incredible!

24
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,800
It's all the inventions Grandpa made
for the isolated tribes.

25
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,320
Yes. He was more interested in African tribes
than he was his own!

26
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,240
Look! He dug a super deep well

27
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,000
and invented a whole irrigation system
out of bamboo poles.

28
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,720
You know it wasn't Grandpa who invented
that, it was the Romans.

29
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,920
They called them viaducts.

30
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,640
The Romans? I never heard of that tribe!

31
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,960
Oh, it's a very old tribe
the leader was called Caesar.

32
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,120
Like the salad?

33
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,880
Yes, like the salad.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,200
Put that book back where you got it
we have to go shopping!

35
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,360
Granny, please
can I drive on the way back?

36
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,560
I don't know, Arthur, we'll see.

37
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,280
Oh, please, Grandpa would always

38
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,160
Grandpa's not here, and I'm in charge

39
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,560
Goody day, Mrs. Suchot!

40
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,080
Oh, officer, hello!

41
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,120
Always a pleasure to see you in town.

42
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,240
Thank you, Officer
always a pleasure to see you too.

43
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,360
Good day, Officer!

44
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,040
Good day.

45
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,160
Arthur, um, here, here's the shopping list,

46
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,880
and I'm, I'm just gonna run across
the street for five minutes

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,120
so I'll meet you at the checkout counter.

48
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,200
Can I buy some straws?

49
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,640
Yeah, as many as you like.

50
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,360
Did he follow you?

51
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,680
I don't think so

52
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,240
Perfect! Perfect!

53
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,800
There! It's all there.

54
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,280
Perfect, this is wonderful thank you so much
What do I owe you?

55
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,280
Are you crazy, nothing! Nothing at all!

56
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,120
Now, get going before he catches you.

57
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,560
I'm speechless, I don't know how thank you!

58
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,400
By letting me participate!
Nothing could make me happier!

59
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,560
Now, get going!

60
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,560
Thanks so much.

61
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,200
I'm counting on you to let me
know how it went?!

62
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,040
I will, I'll call you tomorrow!

63
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,840
Talk to you tomorrow

64
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,600
Bye then.

65
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,520
Bye.

66
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,080
Oh Arthur! Arthur, no no no it's fine.

67
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,760
You go off and play.
Go off while it's still light...!

68
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,520
Sure?

69
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,160
Absolutely.

70
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,680
Thanks Granny!

71
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,640
Sure.

72
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,120
Yes! Yes! World champion!

73
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,680
Alfred!

74
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,400
Watch carefully, Alfred!

75
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:50,840
You are about to witness the invention
of the largest irrigation system
in the county.

76
00:04:50,880 --> 00:05:01,920
Bigger than Grandpa's
better than Cesar's.
This is Arthur's invention!

77
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,560
Perfect!

78
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,760
By the grace of God!

79
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,640
Alfred, congratulations!

80
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,480
It's a remarkable invention
that'll go down in history!
Believe me!

81
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,200
Arthur! Telephone!

82
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,000
You'll have to excuse me!

83
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,640
Probably the uh
president calling to congratulate me.

84
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,000
Hey! I built an irrigation system like Cesar's!

85
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,040
Now the radishes will grow twice as fast!

86
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,520
Huh? Is this my honey pie?
Who is this Seesher?

87
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,640
One of Grandpa's colleagues...

88
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,440
but I followed Grandpa's blueprints
and it works really well!

89
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,240
I hope you can get here before nighttime
so you can see it...

90
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,120
where are you now?

91
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,640
Um... well, we're still in the city, Arthur.

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,760
Huh?! Oh. Well...
I guess you'll see it tomorrow morning then?

93
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,960
Um, No
we're not going to able to make it Arthur

94
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,800
but even though we can't be there,

95
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,640
we wanted to
tell you that we're thinking of you

96
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,840
Because... today is... your birthday!

97
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,560
Happy Birthday son!

98
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,200
Thought we'd forgot, didn't you!

99
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,680
But ten years old is a big deal!

100
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,560
You're a big boy now, aren't you?

101
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,360
(ON) So how did you like the present?

102
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,480
We haven't gotten it yet, you idiot!

103
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,120
What?

104
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,960
No, I fixed it with Granny.

105
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,160
Yes, you can go into town tomorrow
and pick out whatever you like.

106
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,160
Not too expensive!

107
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,040
Just joking, son!

108
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,880
But we'll see you real soon
and uh remember you have yourself a

109
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,520
Happy birthday!

110
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,840
It wasn't the president.

111
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,680
Happy birthday to you!

112
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,720
Happy birthday to you!

113
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,440
Happy birthday dear Arthur!

114
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,240
Happy birthday to you!

115
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,320
You know what?
You're the best Granny in the world!

116
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,360
And you're the best grandson!

117
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,600
Go on, blow them out!

118
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,920
Presents first?

119
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,200
Oh, right. This is from Alfred.

120
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,880
I never had a new one before!
Thank you Alfred!

121
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,840
No, ah! If you could wait till
you're outside to throw it

122
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,080
I'd consider that a favor

123
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,760
Oh, yeah, you're right.

124
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,720
And this is from me.

125
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,280
It's beautiful!

126
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,960
How did you manage to bake a cake?
I thought the oven was broken.

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,360
Mrs. Kerman from the hardware store
actually made it!

128
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,040
Still like it?

129
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,960
It's fantastic. Just too big for three.

130
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,240
Don't be too hard on them
Arthur! They try their best

131
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,320
I spend my whole year
in boarding school in England,

132
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,920
and when I come back for vacation
they're not even here!

133
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,800
Anyway I'm used to it now
they're never here for my birthday.

134
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,480
Wait! Make a wish.

135
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:35,040
I wish that, for my next birthday
Grandpa will be here to share it.

136
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,800
Better blow them out quick
you don't wanna eat a wax cake!

137
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,160
Every night this
magnificent sunset was all ours.

138
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,920
It's precisely into this landscape
that your mother came into the world.

139
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,600
While I was having the baby
your grandfather was painting this.

140
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,440
Who are they?

141
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,080
The BOGO-MATASSALAI.

142
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,880
Your grandfather helped build
an irrigation ditch for them

143
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,800
and in return they gave him
a big bag of rubies.

144
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,520
Really?

145
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,840
Really. Oh, I could tell you stories all night long

146
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,720
Great! Tell me.

147
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,920
No, not tonight, Arthur, maybe tomorrow.

148
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,520
Come on!

149
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,560
No, I haven't even cleaned the kitchen.

150
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,280
Please, Granny. Just a little! It's my birthday!

151
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,240
Alright, just one minute.

152
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,360
OK.

153
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,240
The Bogo-Matassalai were very, very tall.

154
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,080
They say that nature always balances itself
with its opposite

155
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,640
and for centuries they searched for them,

156
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,080
in order to find perfect harmony.

157
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,080
And did they find them?

158
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,760
Yes.
It was another tribe living right next to them

159
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,760
and they had this particular trait:
they were small as a tooth...

160
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,360
They called them the Minimoys!

161
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,080
Wow! Did they get along?

162
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,360
Oh, wonderfully! Soon they were inseparable!

163
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,880
The one side very incredibly tall,

164
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,160
the other incredibly small.
And only together could

165
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,240
they have a complete vision of the world.

166
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,400
Who's this?

167
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,920
This is the Princess Selenia.
Daughter of the king of the Minimoys.

168
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,120
She's beautiful! I mean, this is incredible!

169
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,800
Yes and the king himself
gave your grandfather

170
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,680
the secret of
how to find him anytime he wanted!

171
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,520
That's what your grandfather said;

172
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,920
every time he was a little drunk.

173
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,080
I'd like to meet the Minimoys too.

174
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,800
Now, to sleep!

175
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,080
Sweet dreams.

176
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,400
We miss you Archibald. We really do.

177
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,800
No!

178
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,920
How you doing, kid?

179
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,120
Nice shot.

180
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,880
Oh! Mr. Davido! You startled me!

181
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,320
I'm so sorry!'

182
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,280
Spring cleaning? Need a hand?

183
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,200
No, thank you. What do you want this time?

184
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,080
Here it is! Done! Signed
sealed and delivered.

185
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,160
You didn't waste any time!

186
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,160
That was a coincidence really.
I was in church, this morning

187
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,160
You were in church?
I've never seen you there.

188
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,880
Oh, I usually sit in the back. Modesty really.

189
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,760
You really should have been there.

190
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,680
You would have seen the Mayor,

191
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,760
who confirmed the document

192
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,160
which pronounces the expiration
of your ownership

193
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,920
of this property for lack of payment.
The president of the bank,

194
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,920
who transferred your debt to me.
And as amazing as it may seem,

195
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,240
you know who else was there?

196
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,760
The Notary and the Chief of Police

197
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,560
who countersigned the order of eviction.

198
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,160
So you see
there is not a single signature missing,

199
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,240
and if your husband does not sign this paper
within the next 48 hours,

200
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,840
I will be under the obligation to evict you
from this property

201
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,840
whether your laundry is dry or not!

202
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,760
Ah! You should to hang him up to dry as well!

203
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,560
Are we gonna have to leave the house?

204
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm afraid so

205
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,240
I won't be able to hold off
that vulture Davido much longer

206
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,520
but what about the treasure?

207
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,720
The rubies that the Matassalais gave Grandpa?

208
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,600
Your grandpa hid them somewhere out
there in the yard.

209
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,960
I dug for weeks!

210
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,960
And I... he hid them so well I haven't been
able to find them.

211
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,560
Where are you going?

212
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,560
You think I'm gonna hang around

213
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,720
twiddling my thumbs for forty eight hours?

214
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,920
I'm gonna find the treasure!

215
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,160
Just like his Grandpa!

216
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,960
You should go and find my car rather
than sitting there watching me.

217
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,320
Can I help you?

218
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,960
Oh! Pardon me!

219
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,360
You came by our house once and left this.

220
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,040
You said if we ever wanted to get rid
of any furniture or knick knacks

221
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,800
Yes?

222
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,400
Well, I, I brought this...
it's from my private collection

223
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,920
I wondered if it was at all valuable.

224
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,280
Ah! What is this? A carnival mask?

225
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,120
No, this is an African mask.

226
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,680
This is... this belonged to the chief
of the Bogo-Matassalai tribe.

227
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,320
Two bucks.

228
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,920
Two dollars?
But this is... of inestimable value

229
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,760
Alright alright, two fifty.

230
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,880
That's the best I can do!

231
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,480
This kind of exotic object
just isn't selling any more.

232
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,120
People want practical
concrete, modern stuff, you know.

233
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,040
I can't believe you'd have hidden the treasure
in the yard

234
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,640
without leaving some sort of clue,

235
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,160
a note, something to help us find it!

236
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,800
Malthazar... the Evil... M

237
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,240
I hope
I have the honor of meeting you one day,

238
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,160
Princess! In the meantime

239
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,600
Permit me to steal a kiss.

240
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,080
Jealous!

241
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,520
I knew it!

242
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,160
to get to the land of the Minimoys
put your trust in Shakespeare.

243
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,760
The house is here... south is that way.

244
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,720
The tree! The elf! The moon!

245
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,200
It's all there!

246
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,920
Alfred! We found it! Yes!

247
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,240
Ah!

248
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,480
Hang on there, young man!

249
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,320
Arthur, how many times do
I have to tell you?

250
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,520
I don't want you playing in this room.

251
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,640
Excuse me, please, go ahead!

252
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,320
Thank you

253
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:51,880
Granny?!

254
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,360
What?

255
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,360
Who are these guys?

256
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,280
This gentleman is going to evaluate some of
your grandpa's things.

257
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:56,960
Granny?!

258
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,280
What?

259
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,680
You're not gonna sell grandpa's things?!

260
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
I'm afraid I don't have any choice anymore!

261
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,400
Yes we do! Look!
It's the map to get to the Minimoys!

262
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,000
What map?

263
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,520
They're here!

264
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,720
Grandpa brought them back
from Africa with him!

265
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,600
If we can get to them,

266
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,040
I'm sure they can lead us to the treasure!

267
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,080
Arthur you're a big boy now, right?

268
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,120
You don't really believe

269
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,600
there are little elves running around the garden

270
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,000
just waiting for you to visit

271
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,680
so they can slap a bag of rubies in your hand!

272
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,360
Pardon me?

273
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,320
No, nothing...
I... I was chatting with my grandson.

274
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,320
If you have jewels, we are interested

275
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,480
Unfortunately, not a jewel on the horizon.

276
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,560
Go to your room, now

277
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,080
<some words may hide others>
William. 'S' for Socrates?

278
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,960
Shakespeare. William Shakespeare.

279
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,480
Ah! Not too far off!

280
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,440
Yes. Better hurry and make your choice
before I change my mind.

281
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,280
Come on let's go.

282
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:42,920
Granny

283
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,440
Let's go

284
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,240
Three hundred dollars.

285
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,640
It's not very much for thirty years of memories!

286
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,880
A down payment! If sell them well
you'll have more

287
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,280
thank you.

288
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,760
Mrs. Suchot?

289
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,160
Yes.

290
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,280
Frederic De Saint-Clair.

291
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,920
Process server, Bailiff.

292
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,360
It seems I came at an opportune time.

293
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,840
I have a claim for
debt collection which concerns you,

294
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,200
for non-payment of services rendered
by a certain Mr. Davido,

295
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,000
Ernest, for the amount of
two hundred fifty two dollars,

296
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,320
now with the
six percent late penalty surcharge,

297
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,280
and procedural fees added,

298
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,160
that comes to a total of
two hundred ninety five dollars
and five cents.

299
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,400
May I?

300
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,800
Here's your change.

301
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:23,880
Hello?

302
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,960
Sweetie it's mom, is everything alright?

303
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,480
Great!

304
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,440
We're cleaning up today!

305
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,640
It's amazing how much old stuff
just piles up around the place...

306
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,480
but, thanks to Granny, we threw it all out!

307
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,800
Arthur! Don't upset your parents!

308
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,480
Did you hang up on your mother?

309
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,240
Of course not! It hung up by itself!

310
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,760
Well, she'll call back in a second!

311
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
Granny! They've cut the phone line!

312
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,400
Don't you see what's happening?

313
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,360
We've fallen into their trap,

314
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
and it's closing in on us a little bit
more every minute!

315
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,600
But as long as I live and breathe,

316
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,320
they're not gonna get this house!

317
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,440
There you see? That's probably the repairman.

318
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,800
Good evening ma'am!

319
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,800
You came at just the right time!

320
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,760
Our phone's just been cut off

321
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,440
and I really think you should warn people!

322
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,040
I agree, ma'am,

323
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,480
but I'm not from the phone company,

324
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,320
I'm from the electric company.

325
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,840
And I came to tell you

326
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,560
that you're gonna be cut off soon
for nonpayment.

327
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,640
Some words may hide others

328
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,520
Grandpa help me

329
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,040
When am I gonna get cut off?

330
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,360
That's what I call a clear answer...

331
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,560
Don't move, I'll get a candle.

332
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,800
Some words may hide others...! Of course!

333
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,680
My dear Arthur. I was sure
I could count on you to find my riddle.

334
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,800
You must be at least ten to have
become so clever.

335
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
I, on the other hand, have not been so clever,

336
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,880
and if you are reading this
I am probably dead.

337
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,760
Therefore, the heavy task of accomplishing
my mission now falls to you.

338
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,080
If you accept it, that is.

339
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,720
I accept, Grandpa.

340
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,280
I knew you would. Bravo.
To get to the land of the Minimoys,

341
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,400
you must know on which day
the next passage will fall.

342
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,440
There's only one per year.

343
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,120
Take the universal calendar from my desk.
The night of the tenth moon,

344
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,560
at precisely midnight
the moonlight-passage will open

345
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,520
If you follow my instructions,

346
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,760
on the twentieth knock, you

347
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,760
will have the world in your hands

348
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:28,560
That's today!

349
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,440
Night brings good counsel
Arthur. We'll sleep on it

350
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,880
Tomorrow will bring a solution.

351
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,240
Good night, Granny.

352
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,360
Goodnight.

353
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,240
The world in my hands... world in my hands.

354
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,320
On the right side of the chimney,

355
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,920
there's a button
Turn it all the way to the right,

356
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,080
and then turn it back to the left.

357
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,680
Only twenty minutes before midnight.
I've got to do something.

358
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,640
Damn!

359
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,400
Ah! I thought you were in the shower!

360
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,640
No, I was in the living room looking
for my sleeping drops...

361
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,760
And if you don't get back into bed this second

362
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,400
I'm gonna make you drink the whole bottle!

363
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,560
Go!

364
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,520
Go on! Go on!

365
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,480
You know, I don't like to do this.

366
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,200
But I'm gonna lock you in.

367
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,480
I don't want you to do anything stupid tonight.

368
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:12,960
OK.

369
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,040
OK

370
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:13,080
Alfred, what're you doing?
Go to sleep.
Is it the full moon or what?

371
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,760
Thank you, Alfred

372
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,160
Aaaah!

373
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,320
Granny!?

374
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,720
Always keeps this key with you

375
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,400
The garden, the tree, the telescope

376
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,200
Oh my god!

377
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,520
I need more light!

378
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,320
I've seen Granny do this a hundred times.

379
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:42,400
Oh, yeah, the brake... Ah! Oh! No! No!

380
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,160
Perfect!

381
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,640
Sorry, old man!

382
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
Now for the dolls.

383
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,200
Ah! Alfred!

384
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,440
Arthur?

385
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,000
Uh, yeah.

386
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,920
Follow me!

387
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,440
Oh, okay

388
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,480
Hi.

389
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,440
Time to go.

390
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,200
You're not coming?

391
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,680
Only one can pass through,

392
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,960
and you seem to us to be the best
choice to combat Evil M

393
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,800
MALTHAZAR?

394
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,320
Oh!

395
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,440
Never, never speak that name.

396
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,360
It brings bad luck.

397
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,600
OK, OK...

398
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,160
Your grandfather went off to defeat him,

399
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,600
and now it's up to you to continue his fight

400
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,240
Thanks for the honor,

401
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,880
but... I think it might be better
if I leave my place to one of you

402
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,440
I mean, you're so much bigger
and stronger than me...!

403
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,320
Your heart is the strongest of weapons.

404
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
OK.

405
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:20,880
The first ring, for the body
three times to the right

406
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:28,200
The second ring, for the mind
three times to... the left.

407
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:39,520
And the third ring... one whole turn for the soul

408
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,960
Ah!

409
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,000
There! The door is open!

410
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,600
You can introduce yourself!

411
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,640
Introduce myself?

412
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,160
Yes, and try to be convincing
because you only have five minutes.

413
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,400
Alright! Be convincing! OK! OK!

414
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,880
Euh... There's a... with

415
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,080
Archibald?

416
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,160
No, no... No.

417
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,280
Introduce yourself!

418
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,800
I... I'm his grandson... My name is Arthur...
and you are

419
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,800
Saimono Matrodoy de Betameche

420
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,720
Right...

421
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,040
But you can call me Beta...

422
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,120
Pleased to meet you, Beta

423
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,880
I hope you have a good reason
for using the beam like that,

424
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,960
because the Council has strictly forbidden it

425
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,560
Go on! Go on!

426
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,160
This is a matter of extreme urgency!

427
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,480
In just two days' time
the garden will be destroyed

428
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,920
What are you talking about, young man?

429
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,280
Are you a practical joker
like your grandfather?

430
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,080
This is no joke, Mister Betameche...

431
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,640
A building contractor wants to flatten the land

432
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,600
and build apartment blocks!

433
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,520
Ah...! What are apartment blocks?

434
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,840
Enormous houses built from concrete that

435
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,720
will cover up all the gardens
and stop the flowers from growing!

436
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,720
Ah! But what's awful!

437
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,280
The only way to prevent this is for me
to find the treasure

438
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,000
that my grandfather has hidden somewhere!

439
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:00,800
Then

440
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,800
I'll be able to pay off the contractor
and none of this will happen!

441
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,880
Well, that's a really good idea!
All's well that ends well!

442
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,080
See ya!

443
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,560
No, no! To do that...
I need to pass into your world

444
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,360
so I can start looking for the treasure!

445
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,920
That's not possible!
You can't make a journey just like that

446
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,160
The council must first be assembled...

447
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,680
then you must explain your problem to them,

448
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,760
they will then deliberate and

449
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,880
And in two days' time the land will be
flattened and you'll all be dead!

450
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,920
This is an extreme emergency.

451
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,600
Yes, and we have to act now

452
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,960
because the future of your people
is in your hands!

453
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,160
Yes, you're right in my hands.
This calls for action!

454
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,440
Ferryman! Ferryman! Wake-up
it's an emergency!

455
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,760
You did well!

456
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,640
I hope it will be enough to convince him!

457
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,600
Betameche? You little good-for-nothing!

458
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,080
Don't you have anything better to do

459
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,920
than go around waking up honest people?

460
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,880
My father sent me. It's for a trip!

461
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,000
What again!?

462
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,440
Why does everyone want to suddenly travel?!

463
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,760
The last one was three years ago...

464
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,480
Exactly, that's what I mean
I was just starting to nod off

465
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,680
Hurry up, the King is losing patience!

466
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,240
The King! The King!

467
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,000
First, the moon...! Is it full now?

468
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,080
Perfect, perfect!

469
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,720
Now for the rings

470
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,960
So... three turns to the right for the body

471
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,760
three turns to the left for the spirit.

472
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,320
and now, one whole turn for the soul.

473
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,160
What's happening to me?!

474
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,080
You are going to join our brothers
the Minimoys!

475
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,400
They will lead you to

476
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,360
Help! the Seven Kingdoms.

477
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,360
Stop!

478
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,120
You only have thirty-six hours!

479
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:30,880
Granny!

480
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,920
At noon on the day after tomorrow,

481
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,080
the gateway will close again for 1000 days!

482
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,280
Thirty six hours... I'll do my best!

483
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,560
Aaaaaaaah!

484
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,520
Good luck, Arthur.

485
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,280
Aaaaaaaah!

486
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,840
The key! You have the key!

487
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,240
The key?

488
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,040
Yeah I have the key!

489
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,640
OK. Now go over to the lock.

490
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,120
The lock...? That has to be it.

491
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,960
Good! Good! Now turn the key.

492
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,280
I'm gonna die!

493
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,240
Yes!

494
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:27,280
No, no, no, no, no! Aaaaah!

495
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,720
Welcome to the Land of the Minimoys!

496
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,000
It's not funny! You really scared me!

497
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,200
I thought I was going to die in that

498
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,400
That's incredible!

499
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,800
What's incredible?

500
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,280
I dunno, just look at my clothes
they've changed!

501
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,600
You can admire yourself later.

502
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,160
The council's waiting for you...
Come on, follow me!

503
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,240
I think I'd like to take a little nap

504
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,360
How far've they got?!

505
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,120
You're joking, they've only just started.

506
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,720
Princess Selenia!

507
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,960
My little girl

508
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,360
Father!

509
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:44,000
Sorry. Princess Selenia
may the spirits of the Ancients guide you.

510
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:47,920
Papa!

511
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,920
Yes?

512
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,600
Papa!

513
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,320
Where are you?

514
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,480
I'm over here!

515
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,560
My son!

516
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,160
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

517
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,160
Couldn't you have waited ten seconds
before playing the clown?

518
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,880
I'm on a mission of great importance!

519
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,280
Aah? Because my mission isn't of great
importance is that it?

520
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,840
You're far too arrogant to
be able to free the sword!

521
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,320
You know you are!

522
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:03,720
Uh!

523
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,800
Enough! Stop bickering, the two of you!

524
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,040
Betameche!

525
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,400
I hope

526
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,720
you have good reason for daring to
disrupt this important ceremony.

527
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,200
I do father!
The Upperlands Light Beam
was activated today.

528
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,560
Who would dare do this?

529
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,480
His name is Arthur.

530
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,840
He is the grandson of Archibald,

531
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,200
and he says a great misfortune is
about to befall us

532
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,320
Our great misfortune has a name:

533
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,280
The Evil M.

534
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,760
And we have no need of this Arthur person.

535
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,160
As the Princess of royal blood,

536
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,040
the task of protecting our People falls to me.
Hmm!

537
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:48,160
It's moving! I have it, I have it! I feel it!

538
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,880
Hah!

539
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,600
See, told you so. Way too arrogant.

540
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,600
In view of the circumstances,

541
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,560
the Council agrees to hear this young man.

542
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,160
Cute huh?

543
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,800
Ordinary

544
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,320
My humble respects, Princess Selenia.

545
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,840
Who told him my name?

546
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,400
My humble respects, Princess Selenia.

547
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,320
I'm sure it was you
you're only one that knows this Arthur

548
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,680
You can't keep a secret

549
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,480
My humble respects, your Majesty.

550
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,840
Um... yes... my respects

551
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,560
Oh Arthur, I am delighted to meet you...

552
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,640
I was a good friend
of your grandfather Archibald!

553
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,320
Well, young man... we've all ears!

554
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,440
It's like this...

555
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,480
In just under two days some men
are going to come

556
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,520
and destroy my house, my garden,

557
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,960
my world. And your world.

558
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,200
And you, all two and a half millimeters of you,

559
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,400
you've come to save us, is that it?

560
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,160
The only way to stop these men
is to pay them off!

561
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,320
This is why my grandfather
came to you three years ago.

562
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,000
He was looking for a treasure and...
I've come to complete his mission.

563
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,040
Your grandfather was a remarkable man

564
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,160
He taught us so many things!

565
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,960
He was the one who showed Miro
how to harness image and light.

566
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,040
Then one day he left,

567
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,880
in search of this famous treasure.

568
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,520
And after wandering through the seven lands
which make up our world,

569
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,520
he finally found it

570
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,320
Deep in the Forbidden Lands
in the heart of the city of Necropolis,

571
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,720
where he reigns supreme...
the Evil M. And unfortunately,

572
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,280
no one every returns from the Forbidden Lands

573
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,760
So

574
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,960
Look out! To the central gate!

575
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,680
It's Gondolo, the Juggler of the Great River

576
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,440
That's incredible we thought
he was lost forever in the Forbidden Lands

577
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,280
Stop!

578
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,560
What's wrong, Arthur?

579
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,480
Sire, look over there,

580
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,440
it looks as if a piece is peeling off.

581
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,440
I think it's a trap.

582
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,240
That's a painted canvas,

583
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,200
my grandfather used to do this in Africa to
protect himself from wild animals

584
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:56,640
Well, we're not wild animals

585
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,560
and we're not going to leave
this unhappy creature to die...

586
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,080
Here, make yourself useful!

587
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,200
Oh! Oh my god! Gondolo

588
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,480
Selenia!

589
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,640
Yes, take it easy, Gondolo.

590
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,480
It's a... trap!

591
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,600
Oh...! oh my god!

592
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,840
Arthur!

593
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,840
Clo... close the gate!

594
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,960
Charge!

595
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,840
Come on!

596
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,640
Ready to fire!

597
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,480
Watch out!

598
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,640
Follow me to the palace!

599
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,200
Hurry, father!

600
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,200
Yes, yes, I'm coming.

601
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,480
Hah! Oh, I am sorry, I'm so clumsy

602
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,920
Ahem, perfect timing...
I rather fancied stretching my legs a little

603
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,560
Father! Go and take cover, quickly!

604
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,280
Out of the question!

605
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,000
It's king's duty to face his destiny...

606
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,320
and if only one person is left standing,

607
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:38,480
I will be that person

608
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,840
Ah!

609
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,480
Art... we have to go on fighting!

610
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,560
Sure, but with what?!

611
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,560
Take my weapon. I'll find another one!

612
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,680
This is not working.

613
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,080
Gentlemen, it's time to face up to reality.

614
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,760
Watch out... the walls are booby trapped...

615
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,920
fly close to the roof... it's much safer

616
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,640
I couldn't agree with you more

617
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,240
Come on, my lovebirds!

618
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,080
This is your chance to prove you really
love each other

619
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,000
Here you go

620
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,600
Okay, we'll let them have one final kiss

621
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,240
Okay, that's enough now!

622
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,480
When I blow my whistle,

623
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,560
release your Romeo so he
can get back to his Juliet

624
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,320
OK!

625
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,560
Oh no!

626
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,840
Hi! Okay, here we go

627
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,880
Ah! Come on!

628
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,440
Right, this can't be more complicated
than driving a car!

629
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,160
Aah!

630
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,200
Beta! Look out!

631
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,080
Arthur, I'll never forget you!

632
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,360
No, you fool! it's not feeding time!

633
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,640
No... not the gap...! not the gap! Oh! Oh!

634
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,960
Oh! oh! oh!

635
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,680
OK... here we go again...!

636
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,000
That's it, I've got it!

637
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,240
And one mosquito down!

638
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,640
That's better... now let's go for it!

639
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,640
How brave he is,

640
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:21,920
how heroic!

641
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,720
It's amazing how much he's just like me!

642
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,000
He'd make a good partner!

643
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,320
Father, I'm old enough to look after
myself now

644
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,520
Forget it... Forget it

645
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,720
Oh! So who's next in line?

646
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,280
Oh no!

647
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,480
Oh yes!

648
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,680
Betameche!

649
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,480
Arthur?!

650
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,400
Do something!

651
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,240
Hang on, Arthur, I'm coming!

652
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,160
What a gift he is!

653
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,880
Come to think of it, he does remind me of you.

654
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,400
You OK? Nothing broken?

655
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,160
I'm not sure.
I can't feel anything on my butt!

656
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,280
Just one question...
where did you learn to fly like that!

657
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,720
Umm., driving with my grandfather.

658
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,960
Oh, that makes sense.

659
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,840
Let's rise to the occasion.

660
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,480
Aaah... All's well that ends well.

661
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,840
Mogoth! Let's show them what we're made of!

662
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,520
Selenia... The Master wishes to see you.

663
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,120
Follow us and no harm will come to you!

664
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,320
Come and get me!

665
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,320
Right, go on, grab her!

666
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:39,680
Why me?

667
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,560
Well, who else?

668
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,200
Well, you for example!

669
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,120
Me? Why me?

670
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,880
Four of you attacking one woman!

671
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,120
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?

672
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,080
No!

673
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,040
Pick on someone your own size!

674
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:47,960
With pleasure... With pleasure!

675
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,720
Long live the king!

676
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,320
Oh, my daughter!

677
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,440
My daughter, my child, I must do something!

678
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,560
Cover me!

679
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,160
...thank you.

680
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,160
The sword of power.

681
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,480
It's Miracle!

682
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,400
OK, that's enough now.

683
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,600
Get on your knees
and beg the Princess for forgiveness!

684
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,800
Hmm!

685
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,840
I said, on your knees!

686
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,280
And beg the princess!

687
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,280
Forgive us, Princess Selenia

688
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,760
I don't think we heard that.

689
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,640
Our humblest apologies, Princess Selenia.

690
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,800
Pff, I'll think about it.

691
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,320
That's my daughter, just like her mother

692
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,000
You fought like a prince!

693
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,640
Thanks... This sword seems so light
it all seems so easy!

694
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,320
Of course!

695
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,240
It's magic sword.

696
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,560
It's been embedded in that rock for years

697
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,720
and you're the one who released it

698
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,520
Really?!

699
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,440
Oh yes, my friend... you're a hero now...

700
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:14,840
Arthur the hero! Arthur the hero!
Arthur the hero!

701
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:23,720
Long live Arthur the hero!

702
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,720
Father! now that the sword has been freed
from the stone,

703
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,920
we must act fast.

704
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,840
I would like your permission
to continue my mission.

705
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,800
Unfortunately,

706
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,840
I have to agree with you, my child,

707
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,360
but I must insist on one condition

708
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,560
What condition is that?

709
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,760
Arthur is brave and his heart is pure...
He will go with you.

710
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,520
If that is what you wish, father

711
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,600
I know you are going to make a fine team!

712
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,560
The way is clear

713
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,280
Are you sure that you
haven't forgotten anything?

714
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,720
I'm sure, go ahead... let go

715
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,280
Father
do we really have to take Betameche with us?

716
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,240
Even if your brother is still young
one day he will be

717
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,560
Arthur, if you should encounter
a small mole wearing glasses

718
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,920
who answers to the name of Mino
on your travels...

719
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,840
he is my son...
he's been missing for some three months now

720
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,040
You can count on me.

721
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,440
Alright, let's get going.

722
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,520
Thank you, Arthur!

723
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,240
Hey hero, let's go.

724
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,400
Hey... wait for me

725
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,560
You could at least wait for me!

726
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,680
Oh... I do hope they won't fall into any traps.

727
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,160
I slept like a rock

728
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,120
Arthur, time to get up

729
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,040
Selenia, slow down a bit, can't you?

730
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,920
No way! It's your fault for loading yourself up
like a gamallus!

731
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,200
I just packed a little bit of everything
y'know, just in case

732
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:31,800
Uh... What's a gamallus?

733
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,400
It's like a pachymollet, only much bigger.

734
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,480
And what does a pachymollet look like?

735
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,840
Like that!

736
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,720
Any chance you got something in your bag
for dealing with pachymollets?

737
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,240
Don't worry!
I've got my 300 function pocket knife here

738
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,880
Double knife, multicrab clips,

739
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,000
soap bubbles, music box

740
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,840
and for when things get really hot... a fan!

741
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,960
Hey, that's pretty handy alright!

742
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,360
And then you've got all your classic functions:

743
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,720
like your tulipan, matchet
sunjink, whistler, gullybar

744
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,280
Nothing in there to cut off tongue
by any chance?

745
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,600
No, but that's you specialty, isn't it?

746
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,440
Stay right where you are!

747
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:06,720
run on my signal... now!

748
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,960
Here we are

749
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,160
Anybody home?

750
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,600
Not many people come through this way

751
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,760
Once you've tried it, you'll understand why!

752
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,880
Anybody home?

753
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,480
Oh no! I... I'm sorry!

754
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,680
I mistook you for a bell.

755
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:35,600
Um, no, I mean
I didn't realize you were actually... alive!

756
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,560
Hold on, ma que fa, stupido!

757
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,040
What do you think

758
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,680
you're doing knocking
out all o'my customers like that?

759
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,680
It's not as if I got so many to start with.

760
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,440
Hello. I am Princess Selenia.

761
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,160
I know that...
and that is your stupido brother!

762
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,920
So who's the third comedian

763
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,720
who comes around knocking out
all the customers?

764
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,640
My name's Arthur!
And I'm looking for my grandfather!

765
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,320
Ah...?!
I transported a grandfather a few years ago

766
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:59,600
An old eccentric madman
who absolutely insisted on being

767
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,840
transported deep inside Seides territory... to

768
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,320
That's him! That's my grandfather!

769
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,960
And that's exactly where we wanna go!

770
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,640
Sold out!

771
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,120
Ah!

772
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,520
Necropolis, sure, why not the moon as well

773
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,760
We didn't ask you for the moon,

774
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:19,280
we asked for three tickets to Necropolis
is that clear enough?

775
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,720
Arthur!

776
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,080
Arthur?! You break my door to steal the key?!

777
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,600
Answer me Arthur! Ah!

778
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,800
Arthur!

779
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:58,840
Hey...! fasten your safety belts, please

780
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,640
Arrivederci!

781
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:07,840
Arthur?! Arthur?!

782
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,360
The car...? What's the car doing there?

783
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,680
Ah, here it is!

784
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,200
Wow... That's cool

785
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,160
I got another one just like it in pink...
wanna see it?

786
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,160
Beta, we've got enough light already

787
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,040
Arthur

788
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,000
Where exactly are we heading?

789
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,640
We are here... and we're going here!

790
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,360
Oh my gosh, I know where that is.
That's right under the water tank.

791
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,640
A giant water tank

792
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,400
in the hands of that unspeakable piece of.

793
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,680
Now I'm starting to understand

794
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,560
Who are you talking about?

795
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,400
The most evil of evil

796
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,880
Oh...! MALTHAZAR?!

797
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,000
oops!

798
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,000
Holy humpbacked gamallus!

799
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,840
Didn't anyone ever teach you
to hold your tongue?!

800
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,160
I... I'm really sorry!

801
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,760
Arthur?!

802
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,440
Granny?

803
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,080
And... we're off!

804
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:10,920
Arthur?

805
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,360
How long is the flight?

806
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,280
It's pretty short as long as we can avoid
any unpleasant encounters

807
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,600
What do you mean by...
unpleasant encounters?

808
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,440
Holy bumblebee!

809
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,400
He smashed the door in and now we're stuck

810
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,480
Whoa!

811
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,280
What is that?

812
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,880
I have no idea, but I don't think
we should hang around to find out!

813
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,520
Wh... what are you doing?

814
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,920
I'm getting out of here... oops

815
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,240
Hold on tight

816
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,400
I like it much better when it stops.

817
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,960
Somebody's going to get hurt with this

818
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I'll hang onto it... it'll be safer that way...

819
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,320
Water!

820
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,200
Do something, Arthur!? Get us out of this!

821
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,680
It looks like you two are going to have
to get me out of this

822
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,720
There's a hole in my boat!

823
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,640
Minimoys... can't swim!

824
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,640
I'm coming to get you, here I come

825
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,160
Arthur! Arthur, please?!

826
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,520
I'm coming... I'm coming. I'm coming.

827
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,080
I know this river.

828
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,520
First there's a bend to the right,

829
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,920
then, there's a sharp bend to the left

830
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,440
so to catch up with them, all I have to do is

831
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,720
cut straight across as the crowflies

832
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,280
Sorry, but as the crowflies is as the crowflies

833
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,120
You see. I didn't abandon you

834
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:49,800
Oh, great! So instead of the two of us drowning,

835
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,600
now all three of us can drown together!

836
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,760
No one's going to drown, Selenia!

837
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,840
Surely, you're not going to let a li'l ol'
river frighten you, are you?

838
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:59,480
It's not the river I'm frightened of... It's that!

839
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:04,000
So, Mr. <I'm here>
got any good ideas before we drown?

840
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,040
Sure, course I have

841
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:05,880
Beta, any chance there's a rope on

842
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,440
that 300 function pocket knife of yours?

843
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,000
Erm, no, that's only on the smaller model

844
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,080
I've got an idea!

845
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,400
Hey, just because we're going to die

846
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,680
doesn't mean you can start taking liberties!

847
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,920
No, you've got it all wrong!

848
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,160
I need the lace to reach that tree, over there

849
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,720
I'm not so sure about this idea of yours

850
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,800
Well, I'm sure!

851
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,440
Arthur
have you ever thrown a sword like that before?

852
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,760
No, but it can't be much more difficult
than playing darts.

853
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,000
Betameche you go first! Selenia you next!

854
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:34,880
Yes, sir

855
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,440
Your turn Selenia.

856
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,760
Betameche, hurry up!

857
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,320
I can't, I'm slipping!

858
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,320
Selenia, hold on with both hands!

859
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,320
Absolutely no way!

860
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,320
Whew, we're safe!

861
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,320
Not quite!

862
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,320
Come on, Arthur, hurry up
we haven't got all day

863
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,200
I'm coming.

864
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,920
Selenia, you gotta admit it
the guy is pretty agile.

865
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,400
It's easy when you've got both hands free

866
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,560
Thanks

867
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,800
Arthur, you were fantastic!

868
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:18,040
Right, maybe Mr.
Fantastic can return my lace now?!

869
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,480
It's already so hard without my husband,

870
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,040
I don't know how I'll survive without Arthur

871
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,520
I'm sure he's just run away for a spell.

872
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,240
All of these events have probably upset him

873
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,000
Yes...

874
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,200
I don't think he could have gotten far,

875
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,520
and we've gonna do everything
we can to find him, ma'am.

876
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:31,840
okay.

877
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,480
You can count on us

878
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,240
What was that?

879
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,040
Humans.

880
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,600
Really?

881
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,800
Yep, sometime it's like that all day long!

882
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,800
Aw, rats, this map's a total washout

883
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,040
How are we ever going to find our way now?

884
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,440
We'll use the position
of the sun to guide us when it comes up

885
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,040
in the meantime, let's look for a place to sleep

886
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,080
And make sure you find us something comfy
Selenia,

887
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,640
'cause I ache all over

888
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,720
Beta, if you complain once more
you can go sleep under a bullmunch.

889
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,240
What's bullmunch?

890
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:15,080
It's like a gamallus, only much, much bigger.

891
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,240
Beta, I'm going to need your knife.

892
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,120
Coming right up...!

893
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,440
Ummm... Where did they put the METAGLUE?

894
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,040
Whoops... sorry!

895
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,840
Give that to me, Beta!
Before you end up hurting somebody!

896
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,160
Just hang on, I haven't had it very long!
I just got it for my birthday.

897
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:30,760
How old are you?

898
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,880
I'm three hundred years old...

899
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,960
only another sixty years
and I will be a grown-up

900
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,400
How old's Selenia then?

901
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,720
Almost a thousand years old.

902
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,760
A thousand years old?

903
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,000
Oh, yes... the age of reason...
It's her birthday in two days.

904
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,280
How is this working? Got it!

905
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:57,360
Whoa.

906
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,760
What's she up to?

907
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,360
She's making the bed.

908
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,920
Wooh, I'm exhausted

909
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,640
Goodnight!

910
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,440
Well, he certainly doesn't having
any trouble sleeping, does he?

911
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,960
It's normal, he's still young.

912
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,160
Three hundred years young! It's not bad!

913
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,240
Ah... so good.

914
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:23,160
What about you...

915
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,960
are you really going to
be a thousand years old in two days?

916
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,120
Aaah, yes... and in two days time

917
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,640
I am to succeed my father
and watch over the Minimoy people until

918
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,520
it shall come to pass that my own children

919
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,320
reach the age of one thousand
and succeed me

920
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,040
such is the tradition!

921
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,200
But to have children
you need a... husband.

922
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,600
I know, but I'm not worried,

923
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,280
I still have two whole days to find one...
And now...

924
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,760
Goodnight... Arthur!

925
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,720
Goodnight, princess.

926
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,080
Arthur?

927
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,480
Come on, time to get up boys!

928
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,400
We've got a long journey ahead of us today!

929
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,160
Hello, I said, get up

930
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,320
OK! This calls for a change of tactic!

931
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,280
Argh! Ow!

932
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,080
Come on now, shower time!

933
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,160
That's what I call a rude awakening!

934
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,040
Consider yourself lucky!

935
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:04,680
She's been waking me up
like that every morning

936
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,440
for the last three hundred years!

937
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,200
Mmm... these are even better
than the other ones!

938
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,160
Here, try some!

939
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:27,880
Mmum... tastes good!

940
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:28,800
What is it exactly?

941
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,080
Dragonfly eggs

942
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,160
Hey, come and take a look at this!

943
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,320
Oh...! that's awful!

944
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,720
I suppose... uh, seen from this angle...
it is less attractive

945
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,520
Anybody have an idea what this thing is for?!

946
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:48,240
It's an irrigation system... It transports water

947
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,640
Water! More water!?

948
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,960
I'm... really sorry, I had absolutely no idea that

949
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,360
Wait wait wait, wait a minute,

950
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,680
you mean that you're the one
who built this monstrosity?!

951
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,080
Yes... But I only wanted to water the radishes...
Granny loves radishes

952
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,400
You mean
you actually eat those disgusting things?

953
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,600
Let's just hope that your invention

954
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,800
doesn't fall into the hands of the Evil M

955
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,480
otherwise... I have a pretty good idea
of what he'll do with it.

956
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,600
My straws, they're stealing my straws!

957
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,840
As long as they're getting rid of those things,

958
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,040
I'd say they're doing us a favor.

959
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,280
Try thinking before you talk, Betameche!

960
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,480
The Evil M. knows only too well that
the Minimoys can't stand water,

961
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,360
and your friend, Arthur here,

962
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,960
just provided him
with the means to transport water

963
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,440
where do you suppose he'll send it to?

964
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,920
Oh...! our village!

965
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,840
Arthur, where are you going?

966
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,760
To repair the damage I've done.

967
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,720
I can't believe that guy
humans are really crazy.

968
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,760
That may be, but I think Arthur's right

969
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,120
they're bound to take the straws to Necropolis

970
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,200
...and us along with them

971
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,160
I never get to decide anything!

972
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,080
It's really nice of you to come with me

973
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,720
I'm just worried you're gonna
do something stupid
if I'm not around

974
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,480
Psst! Beta... hurry up!

975
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,240
Beta, your foot!

976
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,080
Oh no!

977
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,760
Here we go again.

978
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,640
Do you know
at least where this waterway leads to?

979
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,360
No! But, in any case
all rivers and waterways meet up at some point!

980
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,160
You always have such brilliant ideas
don't you?!

981
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,520
Don't worry, I'll take care of it
give me back your lace.

982
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,800
Absolutely NO WAY.

983
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,320
Hold on tight!

984
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,480
I hate public transportation!

985
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,360
He's coming this way... He's coming this way!

986
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:59,200
Hey-oh! Hey... what you playin' at down there?

987
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,160
Uh... if the Seides find us first
we won't have a chance to tell you.

988
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,520
The Seides?

989
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,160
You got a problem?

990
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,480
Nope, it's nothin',

991
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,280
I was just checkin' that
the accordion part ain't damaged

992
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,840
We don't need that part
we're only interested in the stems!

993
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,680
Oh, yeah, the stems, sure thing

994
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,240
Get a move on, the master is waiting

995
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,320
Oh, yeah, the master, sure thing No problemo!

996
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,120
whatever you do
don't move until I come back
and get you, got it?

997
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,600
No problemo!

998
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,760
So where are these refugees of yours?

999
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,880
I've hidden them in a mega discreet place!

1000
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,240
Pretty cool, huh?

1001
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,400
Yup, and mega discreet like you said.

1002
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,320
Jackfire all 'round!

1003
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,320
Yes please! Yes yes yes!

1004
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,320
sure thanks

1005
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,360
Hey, Jack!? Fill 'em up,

1006
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,680
this one's on me!

1007
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,960
oh good

1008
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:59,840
Long live the Seven Kingdoms!

1009
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:05,600
Cool!

1010
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,120
Aah! Just what I needed.

1011
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,200
Oh, yep, that hits the spot!

1012
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,760
Ah sorry

1013
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,840
To the Seven Kingdoms!

1014
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,800
That's refreshing stuff!

1015
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,440
As long as you here with me
there's really nothing to fear.

1016
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,440
I'm the boss here. My name is Max.

1017
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,440
Hiya Max!

1018
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,400
And you, young lady, who might you be?

1019
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,640
Selenia.
Daughter of Emperor SIFRAT of MATRADOY,

1020
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,280
the fifteenth of that name
governor of the First Kingdom.

1021
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:38,080
Wow! Delighted to meet you, baby!

1022
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,240
Jack, same again

1023
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,680
Hey, yo Easylow!

1024
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,120
Yes boss?

1025
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,840
let's get this show on the road!

1026
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,120
You got it!

1027
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,160
May I have the honor of this dance, Princess?

1028
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,840
Selenia? We ought to be making a move
we've still got a long way to go!

1029
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,160
Certainly.

1030
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:10,280
Pff... she's too old for me anyway!
She's a thousand, I'm only ten!

1031
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,280
What would I want with an older woman?

1032
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,880
What's a good lookin' kid like you doin'
in front of an empty glass?

1033
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,960
well if wasn't empty you couldn't fill it up
could you?

1034
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,800
I like your sense of humor, kid...

1035
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:28,320
we're gonna get along just fine... Jack!

1036
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,600
Hey hey hey, take it easy

1037
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,320
If you want to find a husband in two days
then, there's no time to lose!

1038
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,080
But, I can help you out if you like...

1039
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,520
That's sweet of you, thanks.

1040
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,360
I like to help out,

1041
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,280
besides which
things are pretty tame right now.

1042
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,960
I only have seven wives.

1043
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,960
Wow! Seven wives? That a...
must take a lot out of you!

1044
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,680
I like hard work,

1045
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,400
I can work night and day seven days a week

1046
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,720
and I never get tired.

1047
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,240
Ah, ah, ah, Wonderful

1048
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:54,560
So, where do I sign?

1049
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:58,000
Anywhere you like
kid it doesn't make any difference.

1050
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:06,120
Excuse me, but...
he's already signed up elsewhere.

1051
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,640
Selenia, it's... are you really gonna
be a thousand years old?

1052
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:15,200
Yes, but we count the years in Selenielle blooms
Selenielle's the royal flower.

1053
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:19,120
Ah! OK, Selenielles.
So, how old does that make me?

1054
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,480
about the same age as me!

1055
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,320
Wow, that's amazing!

1056
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,480
And uh... So, before
were you a little girl like me?

1057
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,000
what?

1058
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:30,480
no, uh I mean, I'm a boy of course
but were you a little girl like the other
little girls in my neighborhood?

1059
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:34,440
No, I was born as I am...
and I've never set foot outside
the Seven Kingdoms.

1060
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,960
I'd really like to take you to my world one day.

1061
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,120
That's Malthazar!?

1062
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,280
No, lucky for you, it's only Darkos, his son.

1063
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,520
Hey... Darkos this is an honor!

1064
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:59,360
Hey... Great timing, there's quite a vibe
going down here this evening.

1065
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,360
I can see that."

1066
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,040
Organizing parties without inviting
our friends now are we?

1067
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:09,720
No way, it wasn't planned
Just a little something we improvised...
to impress the newpunters, you know...

1068
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,200
New faces?

1069
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,400
Warn me if he comes this way

1070
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,440
Hey, Darkos... What's up?

1071
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,720
Selenia... what's a princess of your rank doing
in a place like this?

1072
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:23,920
I just dropped in for a dance.

1073
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,760
Ah, Well then... let's dance!

1074
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:27,880
Darkos, sweetheart

1075
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,920
I would rather DIE than dance with you!

1076
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,400
Your wish is my command, Princess!

1077
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,840
you will dance... for all eternity!

1078
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,320
Easylow, get this place rockin

1079
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:38,880
GET THEM!

1080
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,920
Arthur! Look out!

1081
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:01,920
Hey, they're putting up a good fight
Let's see if they've got the groove.

1082
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,560
Huh-huh-hun-hun

1083
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,800
h... I think I'll go get some reinforcements

1084
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,120
Hey, I like this kid

1085
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,760
Oh! Three against one, huh?

1086
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,160
Then I'll just triple the power!

1087
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,320
Oh how sweet!

1088
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,480
So... You shouldn't have!

1089
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,360
Really, it was nothing

1090
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,440
Woooh, that's my girl

1091
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,200
Holy gullybars! You scared me!

1092
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:52,840
What are you doing here?

1093
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,360
I lost my knife, I gotta find something else.

1094
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,080
You find anything?

1095
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,600
my knife!

1096
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:13,240
Wooh, that's entertainment!

1097
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,480
Easylow, closing time I think!

1098
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:25,680
Charge.

1099
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,240
CHARGE, MY BUTT.

1100
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:31,840
Got 'em! There they are!

1101
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,000
I've got one, I got one!

1102
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,360
Let go of me, you idiot!

1103
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,360
Ow! One of them bit me!

1104
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,000
Sorry, boss!

1105
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,200
Somebody turn the lights on!

1106
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,320
What's going on?

1107
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:46,400
I'm just following your orders
my Lord, ten o'clock curfew!

1108
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:47,720
and it's ten o'clock! (blows out the smoke)

1109
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,720
Late opening authorization granted!

1110
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,720
cool, real cool!

1111
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,960
Come on man, follow me!

1112
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,240
Look, if you go this way, you'll travel safe!

1113
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,120
Oh, great!

1114
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:08,760
This is from Max!
it will lead you right to M's quarters.

1115
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:17,080
Oh, I'm sure glad me ain't goin' along!

1116
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,560
Get out, move aside!

1117
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:28,080
I... want... them!

1118
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:30,640
What was that unearthly scream?

1119
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,440
Oh, just Darkos throwing a little temper tantrum.

1120
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,160
Do you think Max will be able to delay him
for long?

1121
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,840
Max is a real smooth talker
I think we can count on him. Come on, let's go

1122
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:41,360
Oh yeah right, how can you even think about
trusting a guy like that?

1123
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,760
Don't start Betameche!
Just keep walking and shut up, please

1124
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,640
Um...! Wh-w-what's that growling noise?!

1125
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,480
What growling noise? I don't hear anything

1126
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,160
Cut it out, Selenia! I know you're just saying
that to give me the creeps!

1127
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,600
Come on, what was it?

1128
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,240
Oh, no

1129
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,760
he's growling because you woke him up
and now, he's gonna eat you!

1130
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:57,760
I did?

1131
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,120
Now what did you say...?

1132
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,320
The Yeti?! Really?!

1133
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,160
Surprise

1134
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,160
Well this is... a... surprise

1135
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,520
Where's Arthur?

1136
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:22,960
In the garden

1137
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,360
In the... In the garden?

1138
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:27,720
This is it!

1139
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:31,040
Thank you, Betameche! Without you,
we'd be completely lost!
Now, give me your knife!

1140
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,520
Okay, but don't break it!

1141
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,320
Come on, boys, let's go.

1142
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,800
Mmmm, after you, Selenia!

1143
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:39,680
Princesses first.

1144
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:42,480
Men only act like gentlemen when it suits them
huh?

1145
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:44,760
Hmm

1146
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,640
Well, uh... princes second

1147
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,080
Guess it's my turn,

1148
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,200
what do you mean he disappeared?

1149
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:12,280
Every night I told him stories
about his Grandpa's adventures in Africa.

1150
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:15,920
And, last night I told him about the Minimoys

1151
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,120
The Mini what?

1152
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:22,240
The Minimoys, and, um...
.he became convinced
that they live in our garden.

1153
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:22,760
In the garden?

1154
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,800
These are just fairy tales and legends, Granny

1155
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:26,840
Of course, but then,

1156
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:30,860
since I made the mistake of letting him know
about our money problems,

1157
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:35,180
he got it into his head to
find the treasure that grandpa hid.

1158
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:39,300
what treasure?

1159
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:42,020
Honey
what's the use of finding the treasure
if Arthur isn't here to enjoy it?

1160
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:48,700
Don't worry, Granny.
I'm sure Arthur will be right back.

1161
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:51,820
He, he just took a little time off that's all...
No, in the hole

1162
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:55,620
Sorry!

1163
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:56,300
not the face!

1164
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:57,580
Hurry!

1165
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:07,580
Selenia, it's crawling with Seides!

1166
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,400
Duh... what do you think we're hiding for?

1167
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,080
What are they doing?

1168
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,160
They must be taking food to their Master...
let's follow them

1169
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:24,960
Do you think he's there?

1170
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:26,540
Yes!

1171
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:27,540
Wh-wh-what are we gonna do. Selenia?

1172
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:28,900
I'm gonna spoil his lunch

1173
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:31,620
oh... he's not going to like that!

1174
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:34,660
But

1175
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,980
This is where our paths separate, Arthur
I have to deal with this alone

1176
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:39,460
What do you mean?
I thought we were a team?

1177
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,620
Well, the team is about to split up!
You're gonna go look for your treasure...

1178
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:44,340
and I'm gonna take care of M...

1179
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:46,340
If I succeed, we'll meet back here

1180
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:47,900
If I should fail...

1181
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:52,300
I bequeath all my powers to you

1182
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:53,420
What do you mean?

1183
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,180
Be a good king...!

1184
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:02,580
But, wait... we have to

1185
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:04,860
Sele-

1186
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:07,420
Congratulations, Arthur
it was a wonderful (wedding)..."

1187
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:09,260
really one of the loveliest weddings
I've ever been to! Very moving,

1188
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:13,340
clear, concise and quick...!

1189
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:14,460
Yeah... A little too quick.

1190
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,380
Oh, no, you got the most important things,"

1191
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:17,220
her hand and her heart...

1192
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:18,020
what more do you want?

1193
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:20,780
Well, I don't know...
maybe like a party or something?

1194
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:22,620
If you would allow me the pleasure

1195
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:26,260
I would love to be
the one to organize that party!

1196
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:58,500
I spend entire days polishing
that sword to perfection

1197
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:01,260
I'd recognize that sound anywhere...

1198
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:05,460
And who else would have been
able to draw the sword

1199
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:11,100
from the stone besides you, Selenia?

1200
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:13,740
I am delighted to see you, Princess.

1201
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:17,140
Likewise! This way I'll be able
to kill you with my own two hands

1202
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:18,700
Why so much hatred?

1203
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:20,020
Because you betrayed your own people,"

1204
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:23,500
slaughtered entire populations
and bound the rest into slavery...

1205
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:24,620
you're nothing but a monster!

1206
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,540
Speak not of monsters...!

1207
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:28,980
Nor of things which you are ignorant!

1208
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:32,860
Back in the time when
I was known as Malthazar the Good,

1209
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:34,300
Malthazar the Bountiful

1210
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:36,500
He who watches and protects
I inspired such trust and confidence...

1211
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:39,020
that when the drought came

1212
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:41,780
one which lasted a thousand years...

1213
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:44,100
I was the one they chose for the crusade

1214
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:46,180
with the task of bringing back water
of course

1215
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:48,820
but also, all the riches I could reap

1216
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:51,580
Malthazar the Conqueror!

1217
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:54,420
How they praised and applauded me when I left

1218
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:57,340
but I faced every hardship quit alone

1219
01:10:57,380 --> 01:11:01,700
the hostile lands, the ferocious beasts
the bloodthirsty tribes

1220
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,060
lurking in the depths of contaminated plateaus

1221
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:06,140
where even the humans dare not go

1222
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:08,340
But I survived all that.

1223
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:10,060
And having accomplished my mission,"

1224
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:14,740
I returned to my village... Malthazar the Hero!

1225
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:21,420
yet, it was not long
before the diseases and bewitchments

1226
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:23,580
which I had encountered during my voyage began to
disfigure my body

1227
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:26,100
Fear spread through the people...
fear of contamination...

1228
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:29,220
people stopped speaking to me

1229
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:31,660
They crossed the street when I approached...

1230
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:37,180
and very soon
I became Malthazar... the Evil M!

1231
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:40,540
Uh, uh. The version recorded in history books
is slightly different.

1232
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:42,580
It is said that
when you returned from your voyage

1233
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:43,820
you celebrated for months on end

1234
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:48,020
each day sinking a little further into
drinking and debauchery

1235
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:53,300
until you began keeping company
with the worst kinds of insects,

1236
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:55,260
even poisonous ones..."

1237
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:56,220
like a certain pretty, young... uh... weevil

1238
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:56,780
Silence!

1239
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:58,660
You gave your powers to her
she gave her powers to you!

1240
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:00,340
That's enough, I tell you!

1241
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:03,780
I was drunk!

1242
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:06,860
Ah, well, if you can't hold your liquor
you shouldn't indulge.

1243
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:09,460
Yes, I know. I let myself go a bit and..."

1244
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,780
it's true, she stole a kiss from me.

1245
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:14,660
One single kiss which has ruined my entire life.

1246
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:17,300
Next time, try being a little more selective
in your choice of partner.

1247
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:21,700
Next time
my partner will be the most beautiful of all

1248
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:24,940
she whom
I have watched blossom like a delicate flower...

1249
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:29,180
and whom I have long dreamt of... picking

1250
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:31,900
Watch yourself...
delicate flowers might have thorns!

1251
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:35,500
Yes... and this lovely flower alone has
the power to release me

1252
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:40,180
from the spell that binds me
and make me look like my old self again.

1253
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:42,460
Only the very first kiss of
a princess has the power

1254
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:45,940
I know, and... if my information is correct...

1255
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:47,820
you are still unmarried

1256
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:50,780
Your information is a little out - of-date.

1257
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:52,860
Master

1258
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:54,420
Who dares disturb me?!

1259
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:56,620
I have news of the utmost urgency
and importance

1260
01:12:56,980 --> 01:12:58,260
Speak up!

1261
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:08,260
Well, Selenia...
you're more clever than I thought you were.

1262
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,180
Thank you.

1263
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:11,660
You could have saved my life
but you chose not to

1264
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:14,260
Don't count on me to spare yours!

1265
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:18,660
Don't worry, Selenia
you won't die right away

1266
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:20,340
You'll just suffer a little first,"

1267
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:23,460
as you watch the destruction
of your people...

1268
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:25,860
You're a monster, Malthazar!

1269
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,860
I know, I get if from my wife

1270
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:29,100
Take her away!

1271
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:37,060
Leave me alone, let me go!

1272
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,940
I'm married five minutes,

1273
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:44,100
and I already feel like a widower,
and a jailbird!

1274
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:45,300
We gotta get out of here, Beta..."

1275
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:46,180
we gotta think of something.

1276
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:47,420
I'm thinking, Arthur, I'm thinking...!

1277
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:48,020
The powers...

1278
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:49,380
what about the powers she gave me
when she kissed me?

1279
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:49,780
I don't know!

1280
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:50,500
What do you mean, you don't know!

1281
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:52,100
Strangling him won't do you any good!

1282
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:55,220
And besides, you'd better save your energy
if you want to eat!

1283
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:56,580
What do you mean?

1284
01:13:56,620 --> 01:13:57,620
If you want to eat down here,"

1285
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:59,540
you'll have to teach them something new
every day,

1286
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:02,700
otherwise you'll go hungry...
and it makes sense... complete sense...

1287
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:04,900
knowledge is the one true source of wealth
is it not?!

1288
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,460
What kinds of things do they want to know?

1289
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:07,900
Pfff... anything will do!

1290
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:10,860
From the elementary laws of physics to
the behavioral patterns of winkles...

1291
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:13,420
even how to cook garden peas.
I taught them to write

1292
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:15,740
And to paint, especially huge canvasses..."

1293
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:18,980
and to harness light using mirrors
And transport water from
one place to another

1294
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:21,180
Yes...
that's true, but how did you know all that?

1295
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:24,580
Because the man who invented all those
wonderful things is my grandfather!

1296
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:25,380
Arthur?!

1297
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:26,260
Grandpa!

1298
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:30,980
Oh my grandson
I'm so happy to see you again!"

1299
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:33,700
Let me look at you... my, how you've grown!

1300
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:34,980
It feels more like I've shrunk!

1301
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:37,940
Yes, that's true.
But how did you manage to get down here?

1302
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:39,540
Well, I found your riddle

1303
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:43,060
Oh, yes, of course! My riddle
oh, you are a true hero!

1304
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:45,300
Hello, Archibald, remember me?

1305
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:47,980
Betameche?! Is that really you?

1306
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:50,220
Oh... I'm so happy to see you again..."

1307
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:51,620
How is your father, that noble king?

1308
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:53,020
Very well indeed, thank you.

1309
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:56,580
and your sister, the charming Princess Selenia?

1310
01:14:58,540 --> 01:14:59,860
Selenia!

1311
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:05,540
I failed, Arthur... I'm sorry, all is lost!

1312
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:07,340
No, as long as we're still alive"

1313
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:09,300
and love each other, nothing will ever be lost

1314
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:10,820
You are so full of hope!

1315
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,580
You can never give up hope."

1316
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:15,900
Look at me, only yesterday
I was just a small, lonely kid,

1317
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:18,540
and today, well, I married a princess!

1318
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:20,580
a happy princess.

1319
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:24,820
Because she's finally found her prince charming

1320
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:29,460
W-W-Whoa! Time out!

1321
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:30,460
I don't mean to be rude,"

1322
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,980
but don't you think you
should maybe respect the tradition...?

1323
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:36,460
Hey, yes, he's right, what was I thinking?

1324
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,860
Oh, hey, Archibald...! how are you?

1325
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:41,540
Well, actually... not bad at all, Selenia,"

1326
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:42,780
what a pleasure to see you again

1327
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:43,860
Likewise, likewise!

1328
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:45,700
Selenia, what's this tradition business?

1329
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:47,260
Once the first kiss has been exchanged,

1330
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:48,900
then you have to wait another thousand years,

1331
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,940
because then desire
and faith have to be put to the test...

1332
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:52,620
that which is rare is always valued highly

1333
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:53,780
She has a point, you know

1334
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:54,580
And as a Princess,"

1335
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:57,020
it is my duty to follow
the teachings of the Great Book...

1336
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:58,580
besides, you ought to do the same,

1337
01:15:58,620 --> 01:15:59,980
instead of trying to steal kisses from me!

1338
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:02,460
Me? It wasn't me, you were the one

1339
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:07,820
Come along now, you two lovebirds
it's showtime!

1340
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:10,380
If you would care to

1341
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:12,940
Gate open, boss.

1342
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:25,940
My God...

1343
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:27,260
When I think that
it was I that taught them all this

1344
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:29,540
and now they are going to use it against us!

1345
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:31,700
And when I think
that I was the one who gave them the straws...!

1346
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:47,220
Look! It's Mino, Miro's son, he's still alive!

1347
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:53,780
the treasure!

1348
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:02,700
Ah, Archibald
what a great pleasure it is to see you again...

1349
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:03,900
The pleasure is all yours.

1350
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:04,700
So, Archibald
aren't you proud of the marvelous use"

1351
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:06,020
I've made of your knowledge?

1352
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:08,060
Looks like a fine structure...

1353
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:08,980
A shame it's only purpose...

1354
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:11,740
is to flood the Minimoys!

1355
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:13,100
Oh, no, not only that..."

1356
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:14,380
we are going to drown them,

1357
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:17,140
pulverize them, and destroy them forever.

1358
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:20,100
They will die in agony
with my name upon their lips

1359
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:22,580
Look... read my lips

1360
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:25,460
Mal-tha-zar

1361
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:26,860
You really are a monster!

1362
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:29,300
Maybe... but I also know how to be noble!

1363
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:30,900
You are free

1364
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:38,460
See?! All you have to do is follow this tunnel

1365
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,900
and you'll be home in no time!

1366
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:41,580
As soon as we're inside that tunnel
you'll flood it

1367
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:44,660
My poor Selenia
What a twisted mind you have! Come on

1368
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:46,580
hurry up, before I change my mind

1369
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:47,020
Sire?

1370
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:48,060
What is it now?

1371
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:51,420
May I ask You Highness to grant me
one last favor before I die

1372
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:53,300
I like this kid!

1373
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:54,220
what is this favor?

1374
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:56,060
I would like to leave my only valued possession,

1375
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:58,620
this bracelet, to my friend, Mino.

1376
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:03,060
Granted!

1377
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:06,740
Your father sent me! I'll get you out of here

1378
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:09,940
But you need to signal your
position at noon precisely!

1379
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:11,540
Signal my position, but how?

1380
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,620
Using your mirrors, Mino, mirrors...!

1381
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:14,900
Oh? Yes! Mmm... mirrors!

1382
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:15,820
That's enough!

1383
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:18,540
Patience is the only thing for which
I set myself a limit...!

1384
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:20,180
At noon... high noon, on the dot!

1385
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:23,460
I shall allow you a head start of... three minutes.

1386
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:28,940
I hope the burns in hell!

1387
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:30,980
He's already there, Selenia, hurry!

1388
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:32,140
Darkos?

1389
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:33,100
Yes, father?

1390
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:35,660
Prepare to open the floodgates

1391
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:39,060
Is there nothing to nibble?

1392
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:45,140
I do love something to nibble
on during a good show

1393
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:49,460
I can't go on...
and what's the point in running anyway?!

1394
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:50,900
Grandpa... come on, hurry

1395
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:52,940
You go on!
I'm staying here... to await my death...

1396
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:55,780
with a little dignity.

1397
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:57,580
Come on, Grandpa! You can do it

1398
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:59,820
Arthur! What's the point?
you must face up to it,

1399
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:01,420
son, we're done for.

1400
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:05,740
Your Highness, a few tasty tidbits

1401
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:13,380
Mmm, delicious! Bring me more!

1402
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:16,100
There must be a solution!
There's always a solution

1403
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:18,180
The only solution is to pray,"

1404
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:19,180
my children... pray for a miracle

1405
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:19,700
The problem is,"

1406
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:21,500
I've already asked the Great Goddess of
the Forest for so many miracles...

1407
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:23,220
I'm afraid she might get mad!

1408
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,260
A miracle!

1409
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:32,380
A miracle, where?!

1410
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:34,620
Right here, Grandpa, you're sitting on it.

1411
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:35,820
Look!

1412
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:37,540
Come and give me a hand...!

1413
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:40,860
Come on... push!

1414
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:43,940
Oh

1415
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:45,940
What is this thing?

1416
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:49,180
It's a car.
It's a Ferrari 250 GTI 12-cylinder...!

1417
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:50,060
It's a birthday present!

1418
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:51,460
Don't tell me you know how to drive that thing?

1419
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:52,580
Of course I do!

1420
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:53,780
If the young lady would care to step this way

1421
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:55,340
Oh God, whatever!

1422
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:01,740
Bingo!

1423
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:20,020
Hurry, Arthur, please get in!

1424
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:21,060
If we want make it the whole way,"

1425
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:22,460
we have to wind it up as far as it will go.

1426
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:23,580
Arthur, the water is coming!

1427
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:25,060
Hurry, Arthur, please.

1428
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:25,740
Got it!

1429
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:27,940
this is the first time I've ever taken
a girl out for a drive, you know!

1430
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:30,180
Well, let's just hope it won't
be the last... Step on it!

1431
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:32,220
We're off!

1432
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:36,220
Faster!

1433
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:42,300
I just hope there aren't any speed
cameras down here,"

1434
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:43,420
or we've had it!

1435
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:44,940
Hey, go to the left!

1436
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:51,700
I'd appreciate a little more warning
next time if that's OK with you?

1437
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:53,300
OK, Turn right.

1438
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:57,060
Which way do I go now, left or right?

1439
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:58,340
Down!

1440
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:03,340
Selenia... I... I don't feel so good!

1441
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:06,260
Just hang in there, the road is smoother now.

1442
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:16,300
Arthur

1443
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:18,140
Honey, do you hear that strange noise?"

1444
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:19,420
It sounds like
there's running water underneath.

1445
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:22,980
Oh great, now you're hearing voice
just like Joan of Arc did?"

1446
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:24,820
Next thing you know you're gonna
be seeing little angels

1447
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:29,220
and great big ghosts
with spears and armor coming after you

1448
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:31,060
Wait wait, you might want to turn around,"

1449
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:34,300
there's, there's large men
with necklaces and feathers

1450
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,540
and I don't know... I...

1451
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:38,900
What the...

1452
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:44,420
What time is it?

1453
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:46,500
The time?! sure!

1454
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:47,980
According to our calculations,"

1455
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:50,860
the water should hit the village in three balls time.

1456
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:53,300
What time is it, my dear Miro?

1457
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:54,940
Five to noon, my good king.

1458
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:57,180
Only five minutes left and still... no news.

1459
01:21:57,220 --> 01:21:58,140
Have faith in them, my good king..."

1460
01:21:58,180 --> 01:21:59,540
I am sure that they will succeed.

1461
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:02,940
May the Gods hear you
Miro, may the gods hear you...

1462
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:14,780
Look, there's the gate!

1463
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:15,540
Yes

1464
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:18,500
We made it!

1465
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:24,140
Arthur
you're not going break down on us now?!

1466
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:26,700
Sorry
I guess we're gonna have to get out and... RUN!

1467
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:32,180
What is that rumbling noise?

1468
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:34,900
I have no idea, Sire
but I have a terrible foreboding

1469
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:37,780
Father, it's me, Selenia!

1470
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:39,380
My daughter... they have returned!

1471
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:42,060
Open the gate!

1472
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:44,140
Open the gate now!

1473
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,460
Close the gate immediately!

1474
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,420
Open it, close it, make up your mind

1475
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:55,580
All together now!

1476
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:08,380
You did it daddy, you did it!"

1477
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:11,700
You are now the uncontested Master
of all the Kingdoms!

1478
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:12,740
Heaven knows,"

1479
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:15,180
I don't care about titles and honors,

1480
01:23:15,220 --> 01:23:18,740
but I must admit that it does feel good
to be Supreme Ruler.

1481
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:20,460
Let us prepare ourselves.

1482
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:25,060
The gate looks as if it will hold.

1483
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:25,900
Not for long!

1484
01:23:25,940 --> 01:23:26,420
It will!

1485
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:27,700
Oh, my children!

1486
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:28,020
Papa!

1487
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:29,140
Daddy!

1488
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:31,500
We missed you, Papa

1489
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:32,340
Oh, my children,"

1490
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:34,660
what a joy it is to
have you back safe and sound!

1491
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:57,140
What's wrong?

1492
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:01,620
No, the phone's cut off, it doesn't work."

1493
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:03,060
What is wrong?!

1494
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:05,180
AHHHH... Ou... out there!

1495
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:06,180
What's out there?

1496
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:06,860
Five!

1497
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:07,700
Five what?

1498
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:09,100
Blllllaaaaaack!

1499
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:10,780
What are you talking about?

1500
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:11,820
Huge!
(panicky whispers, then, LOUD)

1501
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:12,780
Where're you going?"

1502
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:14,900
Don't leave me here, no Granny please!

1503
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:20,180
it's noon!

1504
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:22,500
In one minute!

1505
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:26,100
Hurry now, you only have one minute

1506
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:27,420
Arthur, I must confess we'd..."

1507
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:29,700
well we'd pretty much lost all hope,

1508
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:31,620
but you've brought my children back to me!

1509
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:34,180
And the Minimoys
will be eternally grateful to you.

1510
01:24:35,420 --> 01:24:38,420
And a second turn of the wheel for the spirit

1511
01:24:38,660 --> 01:24:40,820
Thank you for everything,"

1512
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:42,340
my friend. Take good care of my son-in-law.

1513
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:45,340
Sure, and you, you take good care of"

1514
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:49,020
my granddaughter-in-law.

1515
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:50,260
It's going to pretty dull around here
without you!

1516
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:51,100
Come back soon, huh?

1517
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:53,940
At the tenth moon, that's promise.

1518
01:24:57,980 --> 01:25:00,620
Ten moons, that gives us plenty
of time to put our desire

1519
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:03,220
to the test and respect the protocol!

1520
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:06,060
To hell with the protocol!

1521
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:10,660
and a third turn of the wheel for the soul.

1522
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:31,940
See you... ten moons!

1523
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:42,540
Thank you! You okay? Yeah, thanks!

1524
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:43,740
Mom?

1525
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:45,660
Mom...! Mom?

1526
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:48,620
Honey, what, get out... what...

1527
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:55,060
oh! Arthur! where have you been?

1528
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:55,980
I was with the Minimoys

1529
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:57,380
The Min... Miniwhat?

1530
01:25:57,420 --> 01:25:58,740
The Minimoys!

1531
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:02,620
Oooh... Ha, ha!

1532
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:04,060
Mom?!

1533
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:05,340
Oh Granpa!

1534
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:07,700
Are you okay?

1535
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:11,220
My brothers!
Oh I'm so glad to see you again!

1536
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:17,180
Grandpa! We've got no time left
we gotta go!

1537
01:26:17,220 --> 01:26:19,060
You're right

1538
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:22,900
Noon on the dot!

1539
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:24,940
and no one in sight!

1540
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:27,420
I'm afraid
though it is a beautiful Sunday

1541
01:26:27,460 --> 01:26:29,100
despite it being the day of our Lord...

1542
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:32,700
there seems to be no miracle! So

1543
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:36,820
You're right Davido

1544
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:38,540
it is a beautiful, beautiful Sunday!

1545
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:39,940
I believe we have some papers to sign

1546
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:41,020
am I right?

1547
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:41,940
Let's go in the living room,

1548
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,460
we'll be more comfortable!

1549
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:50,100
While I try to buy time,

1550
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:51,020
you get busy finding the treasure

1551
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:52,180
OK!

1552
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:05,180
Mino, Mino where are you? Mino!

1553
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,820
This is not gonna be easy!

1554
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:13,940
Light!

1555
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:39,140
I promised you riches and power

1556
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:42,140
And Malthazar always keeps his promises.

1557
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:44,140
nothing can stop us now!

1558
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:47,180
The Seven Kingdoms are... mine!

1559
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:50,900
I mean, of course, ours

1560
01:27:54,820 --> 01:27:56,220
What?

1561
01:27:56,260 --> 01:27:57,380
Excuse me,

1562
01:27:57,420 --> 01:27:58,500
could you tell me what time it is,

1563
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:00,260
I'm kinda far-sighted

1564
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:02,980
NOON!

1565
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:04,060
Thank you!

1566
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:06,380
My fearless and faithful warriors!

1567
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:09,060
...let the festivities begin.

1568
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:15,180
Now if I do the exact opposite,

1569
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:18,100
the light which reflects downwards should
then reflect... upwards!

1570
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:28,500
Mino! You're the best.

1571
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:32,700
But what is he doing? Darkos!?

1572
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:34,380
That idiot will give our position away!

1573
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:35,980
Make him cut that beam immediately!

1574
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:37,860
Cut the beam!

1575
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:39,900
Huh? Uh, sorry, because I'm far sighted,

1576
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:40,900
but I'm also hard of hearing!

1577
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:46,020
You fool! You will be sorry
that you defied Malthazar!

1578
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:52,540
Oh, it's nothing, really!

1579
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:53,980
Bring him here!

1580
01:28:54,020 --> 01:28:56,540
Watch out! I can get really nasty!

1581
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:58,780
Sure you can... come on, show us!

1582
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:16,940
WHAT IS THIS THING?

1583
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:21,060
I know, I know... Oh gracious Lord
it's a kind of

1584
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:42,980
Damn!

1585
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:48,540
Father! What shall I do?
What about me, father?

1586
01:29:53,980 --> 01:29:57,100
As for you, my son...

1587
01:29:57,180 --> 01:30:00,700
I hereby solemnly appoint you Commander
of the Imperial Forces!

1588
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:02,700
Oh... thank you, father, that's nice

1589
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:04,260
but... you wouldn't have a place left
on that mosquito of yours,

1590
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:05,100
would you?!

1591
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:07,500
A Commander never deserts his post...!

1592
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:13,660
Father... Daddy!?

1593
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:26,300
Mino? Yes!

1594
01:30:30,980 --> 01:30:32,660
More coffee?

1595
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:34,820
No! No more coffee! Thank you!

1596
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:37,140
But what I would love is
for you to sign the paper!

1597
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:39,660
Of course, what did I do with my pen?

1598
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:43,540
Oh what a lovely pen!

1599
01:30:43,580 --> 01:30:45,020
We have wasted enough time.

1600
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:46,060
Sign!

1601
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:47,140
Of course.

1602
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:56,820
And now... the money!

1603
01:30:56,860 --> 01:31:00,620
Hm? Oh the money, yes!

1604
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:02,740
I'd like to see how you're going to
pull one of your tricks now!

1605
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:04,100
Here!

1606
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:07,820
Bravo my boy!

1607
01:31:11,980 --> 01:31:18,980
So then...
good accounts make for good friends
isn't that right?

1608
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:22,740
There you are, paid in full!

1609
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:31,180
Sir, I must now be saying goodbye!

1610
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:32,340
Good bye now.

1611
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:34,460
Good bye!

1612
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:46,420
Congratulations!

1613
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:48,580
Nobody move!

1614
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:50,380
I said!

1615
01:31:56,980 --> 01:31:59,660
So that's why you
had your sights set on this land?

1616
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:02,900
Of course! The call of greed
now and forever!

1617
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:04,300
One night you had a few too many,

1618
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:05,940
and you told me about this treasure,

1619
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:08,260
and ever since
I have not had a good night's sleep!

1620
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:10,180
But now, it's mine!

1621
01:32:10,220 --> 01:32:12,580
Thanks kid! Nice job!

1622
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:13,900
Well, I'll be saying my farewells,

1623
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:16,100
you won't be seeing me ever again!

1624
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:20,420
Because, I am going far, far away!

1625
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:24,300
You're coming with me! C'mon!

1626
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:27,260
Get your hands off me. I know the governor!

1627
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:28,660
Yeah, so do I

1628
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:33,660
I'll take that. I'll take that.

1629
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:34,380
Next time...

1630
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:35,980
please put your gift in a safer place.

1631
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:36,740
That's a promise.

1632
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:40,020
I'll take it. It's much safer with me.

1633
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:03,340
Don't worry Mino,

1634
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:05,100
I'm gonna care of you.

1635
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:15,060
They did it!

1636
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:22,700
Yes, he made it!

1637
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:29,700
Howl would have loved
my little Mino to see this!

1638
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:31,340
I understand Miro,

1639
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:33,140
but our people are safe and sound...

1640
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:35,220
and that is something to be thankful for

1641
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:36,820
Of course. of course.

1642
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:47,460
Wait, I think I know what it is

1643
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:51,420
Hey, it's Mino!

1644
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:53,220
Mino, my son!

1645
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:57,420
Papa!

1646
01:33:59,020 --> 01:33:59,860
Well, there you go!

1647
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:01,740
All's well that ends well!

1648
01:34:02,540 --> 01:34:02,820
Not quite...

1649
01:34:05,700 --> 01:34:06,340
May I?

1650
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:45,660
I think it's ready... Excuse me...

1651
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:48,460
Waited so long for this moment

1652
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:55,540
I propose a toast!

1653
01:34:55,580 --> 01:34:57,540
Here, here!

1654
01:34:57,580 --> 01:34:59,060
Here it comes!

1655
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:02,340
What's that?

1656
01:35:02,380 --> 01:35:03,540
My favorite dish!

1657
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:05,500
African giraffe's neck!

1658
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:06,500
What?

1659
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:13,500
Honey! Honey! Rosie!

1660
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:14,740
Wake up, honey!

1661
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:18,660
Every time she gets a little excited
over she goes!

1662
01:35:21,460 --> 01:35:22,940
Where's Arthur?

1663
01:35:23,740 --> 01:35:25,860
He, he just went to wash up.

1664
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:27,180
He'll be back in a jiffy!

1665
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:45,620
only ten more moons, Selenia

1666
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:02,300
I will wait for you.
