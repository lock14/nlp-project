RIGHT AWAY



It was in 1975...



just before spring.



I was 19.



Time to go.



- What time is it?
- 9:10.



- Shit. What excuse will we give this time?
- Whatever.



- Want breakfast?
- Of course.



- It's me. Open up.
- I'm coming.



It stinks in here!



- Aren't you going to school?
- Yes.



- What are you doing then?
- I just missed the first hour.



Hurry up, then. I have to go, too.
I'm late. See you tonight.



- Coming? I have something to say to you.
- I have nothing to say to you.



- So I'll sit down.
- You're a pain in the ass!



- We're going in here.
- In here?



He won't bother us in here.



What did he do to you?



- Nothing. I just don't want to see him.
- You're exaggerating.



I don't want to see or talk to him, anymore.
He disgusts me.



But you slept with him.



So I slept with him. What's the big deal?



- I slept with him.
- Well, it's something.



That's just it. It's nothing.



- That's what disgusts me.
- May I?



I'm waiting for a friend. I'm a bit early.



- Cheers.
- We're here to eat.



No problem. What do you want?



- Sandwiches.
- No problem. What kind?



- Ham.
- No problem.



Can we get two ham sandwiches, please?



Nothing better than sandwiches
and champagne, right?



- Right.
- Yeah.



I'm going to guess your names.



Oh, there's my friend.
I've got to go. Too bad, eh?



But if you want, we could meet up tonight.
We'll be at Smoking...



on Pierre Charron Street. Ask for Gérard.



Gérard, that's me.



Be there, okay? Gérard.



How much?



Gérard took care of it.



Sketch this for me.



The silhouette, okay?



Just the silhouette. No face. Begin.



He said no face.



Did you make it to your class this morning?



Yes. I missed the first hour. No big deal.



No big deal, but if you keep it up...



Can't you wake each other up?



I'll remind you
that I go to the university, Dad.



Our schedules are different.



Your mother called.



- She'll be in Paris next week.
- Will we see her?



I don't think she plans on it.



She sends you her love.



I'm going to bed early. I'm beat.



- Maybe you'll get up on time tomorrow.
- Good night.



What do you think this guy's name is?



Ahmed. José.



- What do you think?
- I don't care.



- Ready to go?
- Where?



You know. Let's go.



Hello. We're here to see Gérard.



Seriously, how old are you guys?



- We'll tell you, if you tell us your age.
- 23.



23? That's pretty old.



And you?



She's 18. I'm 19.



That's funny, you don't look older than her.



- And your friend?
- Same age.



- Same as whom?
- As me.



- Do you work together?
- Yes.



What do you do?



Stuff, mostly real estate.



And what's your friend's name?



God, you're curious. Ask him yourself.
He'll tell you if he wants to.



I've got to go hang out with them a bit.



I'll be back.



Dance with me now.



- Who's that?
- Yeah, who's that?



- You drew it?
- Yeah.



What's your name?



Time for bed.



Can I turn off the light?



Move over.



- What?
- I'm going to class. It's time.



- I'm not.
- You're an idiot.



That's the way it is.



Wait, I'll show you out.



- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.



- Do you want breakfast?
- No.



- Are you going home?
- No.



Where do you live?



With my parents, like you.



I love you!



What's with all the cash?



It's just cash.



But do you always have so much?



- We do things, mostly real estate.
- You sell apartments?



- Yeah, for example.
- With Gérard?



Yeah, and others.



So why don't you have
your own apartment then?



I live with my parents. I like it there.



I'd love to have my own apartment.



It'll happen.



Be careful.



- Of what?
- I don't know. Just be careful.



It was the good life.



I don't know if it was real life.



It didn't happen, and I don't know...



In high school,
I never aced the entrance exams.



I'll get it.



You have two pieces
quite different from each other.



In one, you're...



Hello?



I'm calling to say goodbye.



Why goodbye?



Where are you?



Where are you?



I just robbed a bank.



We took hostages.



Gérard is dead.



A bank teller is dead.



We won't get out alive.



What are you saying? Are you crazy?



Listen...



I've got to go. I'm calling from the bank.
If you don't believe me, turn on your TV.



I'll try to call you back.



The deadly holdup occurred this afternoon,
in Place de la Nation.



Three gangsters...



killed the teller
who was attempting to trigger the alarm.



Police, making their usual rounds...



thwarted the thieves.



One was shot and killed instantly.



The two other robbers
took cover in the bank.



They are holding four people hostage...



and are negotiating with police.



They are communicating via telephone...



and seem particularly determined
and dangerous.



The gangsters are demanding two million
and a vehicle.



For now, the situation in front of the bank
is calm, surrounded by the police.



The wait continues.



Further developments will be presented
by Gérard Holtz at 10:15.



I wish you a nice evening.



Are you coming? Dinner's served.



- Aren't you hungry?
- No.



What's your sister doing tonight?



She went out. It's Friday.



That's right. It's Friday.



I must remember to give you
this week's allowance.



I'm okay. I still have some. Thanks, Dad.



Are you going out, too?



Yes, but not for long.



BANK



Back up, please.



What's going on?



They're coming out with the hostages.



...17th borough.



They drove around awhile...



to ensure they weren't being followed.



They stopped
in the Meridien hotel parking lot.



There, the two men got out...



and told the woman driving...



to circle the place for 10 minutes...



otherwise, they'd open fire.



- Hello?
- It's me.



Yes?



We left the hostages
at Porte de la Chapelle station.



It's okay. They're not hurt.



We don't know where to go.



- Can we come to your house?
- Yes.



Then we're coming.



Leave the service door open.
Stay in your room.



See you right away.



You have to make a phone call.



Right now?



Where's the phone?



In the hall.



Go and tell him to bring the car.



Here's the number.



Go on.



He says to tell you to bring the car.



Can you give me the address?



12 Eugéne Labiche Street.



Third floor. Buzz and I'll let you in.



He's coming.



We're leaving. We've got to leave.



Yes.



- Do you want to come with me?
- Yes.



You don't need to say yes.



You can say no, if you want.
I'm not forcing you.



I know.



If you don't come, I'll come back for you.



I don't know when, but I'll come back.



If you want me to come, I'll come.



Get your things.



Come in.



- You'll be here tonight?
- Yes, of course.



- Where are we?
- On the Champs Élysées.



I'm suffocating under here.



It's okay. Everything's calm.



Stop. Let me drive.



You can come out, too.



There's no point in hiding
unless you both do.



It's not good to kill.



Shut up. You didn't kill.



Yes, we did.



We're killers.



Who did the killing?



Him or you?



It's the same thing.



We killed.



We're killers.



For me.



Will the pharmacists go on strike?
It's quite possible...



There's absolutely nothing.



...strike starting...



They forgot.



...you know, a conflict...



We've got to leave.



Can't stay here.



...what's known as mutualist pharmacies.



We thought we were Robin Hoods.



Belleville was a slough. It was dirty.



It was poor.



Thanks to us, the whole neighborhood
had color TVs and Dupont lighters.



What did your parents say?



Nothing.



That wasn't supposed to happen.



Gérard.



They shot him like a rabbit.



And that father, the teller.



Didn't your parents notice?



I don't know.



- What do they do?
- They own a hair salon.



My parents adore me.



I adore them.



And they adore each other.



You notice what you want, you know.



You're lucky.



If I'm found, I'm a dead man.



Sleep.



Do you have identification photos?



No. Why?



I'm just asking. To leave.



No, I don't.



There's a photo machine
in the subway station nearby.



Go on. It'll take 10 minutes.



I don't want to go alone.



I'll go, too, after. I don't have any, either.



- Come with me. Let's go together.
- We can't.



Come with me.



What should we do now?



- We're going back.
- No.



- We're going back.
- No.



Eat something. You haven't eaten for days.



I'm not hungry.



Eat, my love.



- Branco! Branco!
- It's a transvestite?



Go on, punch them out!



Wait.



I want to see how prepared you are...



I threw up.



- What's wrong?
- I'm scared.



You think now's the time
to strut your stuff outside?



Are you stupid or what?



It's my fault.



Be careful. Don't lose your head.



They fought?



No. Almost.



This is my place.



Hello.



Hello.



You sleep up there?



No, I never go up there.



But I couldn't sleep.



Is everyone else asleep?



Yes.



- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.



That's a funny name. It's strange.



Don't forget it.



Show me yours.



- Who's that?
- Who's who?



I don't know. Just a person.



We're leaving.



- When?
- Tonight.



Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll be arriving shortly at Hendaye station.



Hendaye, three-minute stop.



We remind you that this train
is destined for Irún.



There's only one. He got on the first car.



Go to the end. Show your ticket.



Once he's seen it, get off.



I'll wait for you at the other end
and give you the bag. Okay?



Wait for me.



- I'll come back to show my ticket after.
- Wait. I'll go.



French Customs. Passport, please.



Thank you.



French Customs. Passport, please.



Thank you.



- Thank you.
- Are you traveling together?



- Yes.
- Yes.



- Thank you. Have a nice trip.
- Thank you.



You'll go through Spanish Customs
before changing trains.



Should I go?



- They went out?
- Yes.



They went to buy themselves some clothes.



We're meeting them for lunch.



Look.



They left us this.



For what?



We're going shopping.



We're going to buy some clothes, too.
Don't you want to?



- Sure.
- We've got to buy stockings.



We've got to buy stockings for us and them.



Where are we meeting them?



Don't worry. I have the address.



Come next door with me.
Their breakfast looks really good.



I'm coming.



You're like me. You're bourgeois.



It's funny that we're with guys like them.



- What kind of guys?
- You know, criminals.



We're not made for this.



- I guess we are.
- You think?



Well, we're here. You'd rather be elsewhere?



No. And you?



No.



We're criminelles.



Is that how you say it?



Criminals, criminelles.



- Are you sure you don't want to come?
- Yes. Really, I don't have time.



- He won't be happy.
- It's okay. He knows.



Do you want me to drop you off?



No, I'll walk. It's not far, I think.



I'll figure it out.
You're okay with bringing everything back?



No, really, tell me.
Why didn't you meet us for lunch?



It's nothing. I just didn't want to see you
with the others. That's all.



What do we do if we're separated?



What do you mean?



If you need to flee, suddenly...



and I'm not with you at the time.
I can't find you. What do I do?



In a foreign country? Like now?



Stay where you are.



And then?



Then I'll know where to find you.



I'll come get you. Quickly.



- Where are we going?
- To my home.



- Where's that?
- Where my family is from.



- Morocco?
- Yeah.



Come on, let's go outside.



What?



Nothing. It was just an idea.



Excuse me.



Can I ask you
what you'll be doing in Morocco?



We're going to visit friends. Why?



- You're staying with them?
- It's possible.



Do you have money?



Sorry, sir. That's fine.



With all the people coming to live
in our country without a cent...



Once again, I apologize. Have a nice trip.



I can't keep them on me. It's too dangerous.



- There's no more room in my jeans.
- Take them!



There's no risk if you have them.



- Where do I put them all?
- Put them in your bag!



CUSTOMS



First, we stayed in Tangier.



We lived in a luxurious hotel.



It was the nicest in the city.
That's what I was told, and I can believe it.



Then we rented cars.



We drove to one village after another.



Usually, they were by the sea,
but not always.



It was like a holiday, our first holiday.



Maybe the only one I'd ever have.



An eternal holiday. Weeks, months.



Sometimes, they'd leave in turns.



They went to convert the cash.
It wasn't going well.



The bills were undoubtedly marked.
We couldn't use them all that much.



They had to be sold for below price.



There were guys for that,
in London, in Brussels.



He told me nothing...



but I knew things weren't going well.



It's happened.



These are the killers



We had to be careful with the money.



We believed we were rich,
yet it was less and less certain.



Not right away.



We rented an apartment
in Casablanca, in Casa.



The holiday was over.



God damn it! Can't you cover up?



- I'm sick of seeing your ass all day!
- Take a cold shower if you're in heat!



Get in.



Where will we go after?



After what?



When we can go wherever we want.



I don't know. Wherever you want.



Okay. But you, where would you like to go?



I don't know.



Maybe...



an island.



- A deserted island?
- No.



An island with people and everything...



but still an island.



Really?



I don't know. Where do you want to go?
I answered.



Where are you going like that?
Come back here!



Where are you going?



Fucking whore!



Where is he?



We've got to leave.



A guy stopped me in the street.



He said something strange. I don't like it.



Anyway, Casa is too small. We'll get caught.



- What do you want it for?
- Take it off.



I'll buy you 10 more.



Excuse me.



There are lots of islands. Look.



I'm scared.



- Scared of what?
- I'm scared.



But of what?



Of everything. I'm sure of it. I'm very scared.



Stop it. Nothing's going to happen.



Greece.



Athens.



I noticed that you had problems with
Customs.



I did, too, because of the visa.
They're such a pain.



I'm Lebanese.



Are you French?



My name is Georges.



- Are you alone?
- Yes.



- Did you reserve a hotel room?
- No.



Where's your suitcase?



Someone stole it.



Did you declare the theft?



- No.
- Why not?



Okay, listen.



If you want, I'll bring you to my hotel.



It's not high season.
I'm sure there'll be a room.



Okay?



Yes.



Come.



- Do you have any money?
- No.



Come.



Do you have your passport?



Eat. It'll do you good.



Okay...



I'm going to a friend's house.



Eat and sleep. You'll see,
tomorrow everything will be just fine.



You didn't eat a thing.



Have a croissant. They're good.



I've got to leave.



You know my Greek friend,
the man I dined with last night...



he's looking for a babysitter.



He's divorced and has custody of the child.



His little boy is 5.



He's willing to let you live in his house...



until your problems are sorted out.



First, he wants to meet you.



That's normal, isn't it?



Here's his phone number.



Everything is written here.



Do you have all the toiletries you need?



Wait, I'll bring you two or three things.



There. I think that's all you need.



I also brought you this.



I noticed you didn't have a watch.



I'm going.



- The plane won't wait for me.
- Thank you.



Don't worry. Everything will be fine.



Thank you.



- Can you start today?
- Yes, okay.



What's your boy's name?



His name is Dimitri. He's 7.



Is that all you have with you?



My suitcase was stolen at the airport.



I have nothing anymore,
but it's not a problem.



You can't stay like that.



Come on.



How's it going?



Your room.



Where's Dimitri?



He lives with his mother.



I get him only on weekends.



- Georges told me he lived with you.
- Are you hungry?



We're going out to eat.
Change your clothes, if you want.



But I'm telling you, I won't touch you.



- No, not tonight.
- I just want to sleep.



Tomorrow I'll slide into bed with you.



I promise, okay?



I promise.



Fine. Okay.



What's going on? Are you okay?



Yes, I'm fine. Sorry, it was nothing.



Are you sure?



- You don't need me?
- No, no.



Sorry. I'm fine.



I'm going back to sleep.



Are you awake?



Are you sleeping?



No, I just woke up.



Okay, listen.



I'm going to work.



I'm in a rush.



I'm locking you in, okay?



No, don't. How will I do the shopping?



What shopping?



The fridge is full.



I don't know. Beauty stuff. Things I need.



Don't worry, I'll be here tonight.



Fine...



I'm leaving the key on the buffet.



Oh, you're French.



What's your name?



Are you here on holidays?



Yes.



I love Greece. I'm out of money.



I want to stay. I'm looking for work.



I work in a boutique.
They need an employee.



We can talk to my boss.



- Now?
- Sure. Why not?



Come.



There's a room at my place.



A guy lived there but he left.



You can come.



Yes or no?



Say yes.



Are you all settled in?



I'm going to bed.



Good night.



Who's that man?



A policeman, obviously.



- Why's he here?
- Why not? He's a friend of the boss.



Why are you scared?



I'm a fugitive.



No, just kidding.



You should watch out. You'll burn.



Does it hurt?



It burns a little.



Don't look at me like that.
You're scaring me.



You're from Paris?



I am. He's from Blois.



I'm from Paris.



We met each other here.



Are you going home soon?



Tomorrow. Our holidays are over.



Do you live in Athens all year?



- No, I'm waiting for someone.
- Oh.



Don't touch me.



Do you want me to leave?



No.



It's okay like this.



Tell them the sentence
I taught you in Greek.



Once more, my darling.



Are you coming?



No, I'm staying here.



- Don't be stupid. Come.
- I said no. I'll see you at your place.



What'll you do? You don't have any money.



I'll find a way.



Okay.



See you later.



I called my father.



In Paris?



Yes.



You spoke to him?



Yes.



To my sister, first, and my dad.
He's coming to get me.



- When?
- Tomorrow.



There he is. My mother's here.



They sentenced him to death.
Forever on the run...



over there...



at the end of the world, or here, so close.
I didn't know.



I waited.



They sentenced me to two years of prison.



Lawyer, court, trial, judge.



I didn't go to jail.



Presidential pardon.



Five years of probation.



They said my name.



I didn't care.



I waited.



I waited for him.



No one came.



I lived alone to be alone.



I wanted to kill myself.



I tried...



several times.



But, no. I waited.



I could no longer stand being alone.



I lived with my sister. We talked a lot.



She was there. And me, I waited.



- Are you having supper with Mother?
- Yes.



Do you want to come with me?
I'll wait for you, if you want.



No. I'm seeing her tomorrow, anyway, so...



- Bye.
- Bye.



You know, we don't have only one life.
We have several.



Several at once?



At once, or consecutively.



For men, it's usually at once.
For women, consecutively.



In any case, there are several.



And what if there's only one real one?



- Hello.
- Hello.



Come in.



I don't know any more than you do.



I know nothing.



You fixed the chair?



I've been thinking of you for a long time.



You took your time coming back here.



I don't like asking.



Where's the hair salon?



The hair salon?



It's near Belleville Street.



Where?



Des Rigoles Street.
But it's useless. Believe me.



- You're going to work?
- Well, yeah. I have to.



- Will you give me your phone number?
- Why?



I don't know. If I have something to tell you.



- You don't want to?
- Yes, I do.



My name is Laurence.



Take a seat.



Come.



Eat. It's good.



Come.



I don't know, my girl. I don't know.



- Despite the police officer's warnings...
- Stop.



...he did not stop
and was killed by a bullet in the heart.



Sentenced to death for contumacy...



he was wanted for the holdup...



Stop!



There's someone on the phone for you.



- Who is it?
- Laurence.



Tell her I'm coming.



What'll you do now?



I've got to find a job.



- What kind of job?
- I don't know.



Far away.



A job, but far away.



- In a foreign country?
- Yes.



Are you allowed, with your probation?



Yes, if the employer is located here.



Okay, I'll call you back.



- When?
- Soon. I'll call you back.



And you've previously stayed
in one of our clubs?



Yes, on vacation with my mother, in Sicily.



What was that place called?



It's slipped my mind.



Cefalù.



That's it. Cefalù.



So you know how it works?



The key is to put yourself
in the shoes of each guest.



You must anticipate what they want
before even they know it.



- Do you think you can do that?
- Yes.



Yes?



Plus, it's exactly what I need,
to put myself in the shoes of others.



Really?



And where would you like to go?



If I could choose, I'd go to an island.



There's no shortage of islands.
