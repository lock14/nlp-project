1
00:02:53,492 --> 00:02:55,575
<i>When I first met Candy...</i></i>

2
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,033
<i>Those were like the
days of juice...</i></i>

3
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,783
<i>Everything was bountiful... </i></i>

4
00:03:04,742 --> 00:03:06,825
<i>Birds filled the sky...</i></i>

5
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:14,950
<i>a great kindness float
through us... </i></i>

6
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,283
Heaven

7
00:03:41,617 --> 00:03:43,700
Here it is.

8
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:51,617
I'm gonna try it your way this time.

9
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:03,075
This is just as good this way.
Honestly.

10
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:07,450
Then why don't you do it?

11
00:04:11,408 --> 00:04:13,492
Schumann,
Why don't I do it?

12
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,283
Dan is a follower, Candy.
Not a leader.

13
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,783
We stick to snorting, keep it simple.

14
00:04:20,783 --> 00:04:22,658
You know...
Dare to be different!

15
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:27,117
Well I think I'd like to try it in the bath.

16
00:04:29,117 --> 00:04:31,200
well that's different.

17
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:43,700
Candy?

18
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,742
Candy!

19
00:04:50,575 --> 00:04:51,617
Schumann, fucking help me!

20
00:04:52,117 --> 00:04:52,867
<i>What?? </i></i>

21
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:53,700
Come here!

22
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:57,950
Come here!
Babe?

23
00:04:59,325 --> 00:05:01,408
Oh, Christ!

24
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:02,533
Shit, I think that she took too much.

25
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,033
Babe!

26
00:05:05,992 --> 00:05:08,075
Fucking saline solution or something?
I need saline solution!

27
00:05:08,283 --> 00:05:09,325
<i>What? </i></i>

28
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:11,408
Fuck it!
Go and get a glass of water...

29
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:13,200
Put salt in it!
Hurry up!

30
00:05:15,992 --> 00:05:18,075
Come on!
Babe!

31
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:20,033
Candy! Look at me!

32
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:22,450
<i>How much salt? </i></i>

33
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,200
I don't know! HEAPS!

34
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,283
Just fucking stir it!
Make sure it's dissolved!

35
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,283
Come here!
Oh baby!??
Fuck!!

36
00:05:28,283 --> 00:05:35,367
I don't think this works man!
What the fuck's salt gonna do?

37
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:36,950
Shut up!

38
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:41,825
Fuck!
Hold her arm!

39
00:05:41,825 --> 00:05:43,367
Hold her fucking arm, man!

40
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:45,450
Harder!

41
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:48,700
This will not be.

42
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,033
Here we go...

43
00:05:48,908 --> 00:05:50,992
No, it's not gonna fucking work!
It's bullshit!!

44
00:05:50,992 --> 00:05:51,950
Shut up!

45
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,033
Call an ambulance.

46
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,283
Here we go.

47
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:01,825
Candy, look at me.

48
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:04,117
Candy! Candy!

49
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:06,617
Candy, Look at me!

50
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,908
Babe...

51
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:11,617
Bring her back.

52
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:14,117
...back.

53
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,783
Enough with the fucking salt.

54
00:06:20,783 --> 00:06:22,867
It was beautiful.

55
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,867
Intense.

56
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:36,950
<i>The future or the thing that gleamed. </i></i>

57
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,283
<i>The present was so very, very good. </i></i>

58
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:44,617
<i>I wasn't trying to
wreck Candy's life .</i></i>

59
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:47,450
<i>I was trying to make mine better. </i></i>

60
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,992
<i>We wanted to share absolutely everything .</i></i>

61
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,033
<i>Especially
the best bits .</i></i>

62
00:06:55,575 --> 00:06:57,658
I want to stay with you
forever.

63
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,533
<i>...and who would'nt! </i></i>

64
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:14,117
It's us!

65
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,033
It's called "The afternoon of
extravagant delight. "

66
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,533
By Candy Wyatt.

67
00:07:24,117 --> 00:07:26,200
It's beautiful.

68
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,783
I love it!

69
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,533
Casper.

70
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:34,533
Casper, It's Dan.

71
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:36,700
Daniel, hang on!, I'm coming in on a win and a prayer!

72
00:08:37,742 --> 00:08:39,325
What?

73
00:08:39,325 --> 00:08:41,408
I'm trying to land
a Jumbo in Dubai.

74
00:08:41,408 --> 00:08:43,492
What?

75
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,575
<i>Casper was like
the dad you always wanted. </i></i>

76
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:50,158
The one that lets you have lollies and fizzy drinks

77
00:08:51,825 --> 00:08:53,908
<i>he lets you stay up late, </i></i>

78
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,367
<i>and watch movies
late at night. </i></i>

79
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,783
Daniel, how are you?

80
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,033
<i>Casper and I went way back. </i></i>

81
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:00,783
I love you

82
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,158
<i>Is that right? </i></i>

83
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:06,200
Yes!

84
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,283
This is George.

85
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,575
A very limited English,
but a very large penis.

86
00:09:10,575 --> 00:09:14,033
Isn't that right, George?

87
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:16,117
Ok.

88
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,867
Our entire conversation is based on the 1995 "Lonely Planet" guide to Havana

89
00:09:21,408 --> 00:09:23,492
Sit down.

90
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,783
Just good friends.

91
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,283
So, what's on the agenda today?

92
00:09:33,992 --> 00:09:36,075
<i>Not much, we're just wandering around. </i></i>

93
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,283
Um, Could you spare us $50?

94
00:09:41,283 --> 00:09:46,200
Does is ever embarrassed you, Candy?
...His naked desperation!

95
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,908
Nakedness, I can deal with!

96
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:50,992
Or give us some ecstasy
we can sell for it?

97
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:53,617
I'm afraid that my days
as a manufacturer of...

98
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,742
recreational farmaceuticals
has come to an end.

99
00:09:56,742 --> 00:09:57,783
Why's that?

100
00:09:57,867 --> 00:10:00,783
I've been made Associate Professor of
Organic Chemistry.

101
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:02,867
- Wow! Congratulations.
- Great.

102
00:10:03,283 --> 00:10:05,367
So, suddenly I have a
reputation to uphold.

103
00:10:07,158 --> 00:10:09,242
Well in that case, could we make it a hundred?

104
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,783
We'll pay it back!

105
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,367
Thanks, Cas.

106
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:29,450
Everything's alright, isn't it?

107
00:10:31,117 --> 00:10:33,700
It's just a cash flow problem.
Only 7 days.

108
00:10:35,783 --> 00:10:37,867
And you, Candy?

109
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:40,492
Being one that's so new to the path
of the dead!

110
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,783
She is fine.

111
00:10:44,825 --> 00:10:49,533
When you can stop,
people don't want to...

112
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:52,658
... and when you want to stop,
You can't!

113
00:10:57,158 --> 00:10:59,867
One of life's little riddles!

114
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,533
What Grandma?

115
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,033
Off you go!

116
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:07,117
Thank you, Casper.

117
00:11:09,325 --> 00:11:10,783
Okay, are you ready?

118
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:12,867
One, two, three...

119
00:11:20,575 --> 00:11:23,700
I feel like some confused
Sesame Street character!

120
00:12:06,617 --> 00:12:08,700
Start the car.

121
00:12:19,742 --> 00:12:23,367
My own parents had long since
cut me adrift

122
00:12:24,325 --> 00:12:27,950
<i>The Wyatts, on the other hand,
kept their firm hold on the ropes. </i></i>

123
00:12:30,158 --> 00:12:32,242
Do you want more potatoes?

124
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:36,117
- It was nice to visit places
where the fridge was always full.

125
00:12:40,283 --> 00:12:43,367
I shall have to bring my plate round
when I come here!

126
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:47,450
I think you'll find that's part of the carbohydrate.

127
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,533
What do you think?

128
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:54,325
I don't know.
I don't know.

129
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,033
See how you go.

130
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,283
Stretchers?

131
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,950
They're like wooden frames you
stretch the canvass on.

132
00:13:09,117 --> 00:13:11,200
and anyway, I feel really stupid...

133
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,367
... I did about a month ago,
and as of tomorrow I'm gonna lose
our deposit on the stretchers.

134
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:20,450
It is really rude to ask...

135
00:13:23,075 --> 00:13:25,158
... but at least I won't surprise her!

136
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:31,200
I can give you the money back
the next time I see you again.

137
00:13:31,825 --> 00:13:34,450
Can you ring him, and tell him to
wait for a week?

138
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:36,950
I already tried that pretty much
last week.

139
00:13:37,242 --> 00:13:39,325
What if I rang him for you?

140
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,533
I haven't got the card with me.

141
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,908
How much is it?

142
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,117
150.

143
00:13:51,117 --> 00:13:53,200
Mate, the question is not the money.

144
00:13:53,617 --> 00:13:55,700
I really appreciate it.

145
00:13:56,283 --> 00:13:59,450
The question...
is the future of my daughter.

146
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:03,617
Mate, she's fantastic!

147
00:14:04,325 --> 00:14:06,408
Should see her paintings!

148
00:14:06,408 --> 00:14:07,950
The question is you.

149
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,783
When are you gonna do something?

150
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,533
I've got some ideas.

151
00:14:18,617 --> 00:14:21,700
I've sent some of my poems into
Heat magazine.

152
00:14:25,158 --> 00:14:29,325
Here we are! -Milk...
and sugar, There!

153
00:14:30,158 --> 00:14:32,242
- Thanks babe!
- Thanks, Elaine.

154
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:35,450
You're not a teenager anymore.

155
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,283
You know that, don't you?

156
00:14:38,283 --> 00:14:39,325
Yes, I know that, Jim.

157
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,783
that is why I did'nt want
you to do it!

158
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:47,783
No, it's alright! It's fine!

159
00:14:47,783 --> 00:14:49,117
Look at it!
You've turned it into butter!

160
00:14:49,117 --> 00:14:51,283
I told you to keep it on blend!

161
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:53,617
I put it on "Whip", because
I'm whipping cream!

162
00:14:53,908 --> 00:14:55,992
Yes, but you don't know how to use it.

163
00:14:56,408 --> 00:14:58,492
Right... You do it!!

164
00:14:58,492 --> 00:15:01,825
- Uhh!! Well it's too late now!!
- Ah well!! Excuse me!!

165
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:04,200
Well all these settings are relatve, and if you're not familiar with the workings of the machine...

166
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,075
Then why the fuck does it say "Whip"?

167
00:15:11,117 --> 00:15:13,200
I'll give them ice cream.

168
00:15:15,033 --> 00:15:17,117
And please don't swear.

169
00:15:21,283 --> 00:15:23,908
<i>Right! Well, I was going to give you cream, but I'm going to have to give you Ice Cream. </i></i>

170
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:29,117
<i>- Everything okay in there?
- Well, we live in hope! </i></i>

171
00:15:30,575 --> 00:15:32,658
<i>A good place to live. </i></i>

172
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:19,617
Go!!

173
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:47,950
I wonder if that was it?

174
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,283
If that was what?

175
00:16:50,992 --> 00:16:53,075
The last shot.

176
00:16:57,367 --> 00:16:59,450
I wouldn't care.

177
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:29,117
It was my Nana's.

178
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,075
We're going to sell anything
We're only hocking it!

179
00:17:33,492 --> 00:17:35,575
We'll get it back!

180
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:59,117
$25.

181
00:17:58,908 --> 00:18:00,992
...and He doesn't want the paints.

182
00:18:14,533 --> 00:18:16,617
I'll be back!

183
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,367
He said maybe we could work
something out!.

184
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:39,117
Let's go!

185
00:19:45,575 --> 00:19:47,658
Yes, I fucked him!

186
00:19:48,908 --> 00:19:50,992
For $50.

187
00:19:51,283 --> 00:19:53,367
I stink!

188
00:19:53,908 --> 00:19:55,992
You okay?

189
00:19:58,908 --> 00:20:00,992
I'm Sorry.

190
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,200
Don't be!

191
00:20:16,408 --> 00:20:19,033
<i>Here is the deepest secret,
that nobody knows .</i></i>

192
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:23,492
<i>Here is the root of the root,
and the bud of the bud...</i></i>

193
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,825
<i>...and the sky of the sky,
in the tree called life .</i></i>

194
00:20:28,492 --> 00:20:32,117
<i>which grows higher than soul
can hope, or mind can hide .</i></i>

195
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:38,075
<i>..and this is the one that is
keeping the stars apart. </i></i>

196
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:42,117
I carry your heart.

197
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,283
I carry it in my heart.

198
00:20:50,575 --> 00:20:52,658
Will you marry me?

199
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:26,200
We will be man and wife.

200
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:29,117
One flesh.

201
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,658
I will ask them if they freely undertake the obligations of marriage...

202
00:21:37,867 --> 00:21:42,033
... and to state that there is no
legal impediment to the marriage.

203
00:21:43,492 --> 00:21:46,617
Are you ready,
freely and without reservation...

204
00:21:46,825 --> 00:21:50,783
<i>to give yourself to eachother...
in marriage?</i></i>

205
00:21:51,742 --> 00:21:53,825
<i>We are!</i></i>

206
00:21:55,033 --> 00:21:57,992
<i>Are you ready for love
and honor each other...</i></i>

207
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,367
<i>... as husband and wife,
for the rest of your life? </i></i>

208
00:22:03,283 --> 00:22:05,367
- We are!
- We are!

209
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:07,450
Candice and Dan...

210
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:14,950
Come back, love.

211
00:22:15,575 --> 00:22:16,825
Ah, okay.

212
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:19,950
Alright everyone, Close together!
Balloons down, Jenny.

213
00:22:20,158 --> 00:22:22,658
Big smiles, everyone!
Happy Day!

214
00:22:22,658 --> 00:22:24,533
One, two... Oh, Shit!

215
00:22:24,533 --> 00:22:25,700
Schumann!

216
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,908
- One, two... Three!
- Right...

217
00:22:28,908 --> 00:22:32,242
Alright everyone!
Back to our place for a few drinks,
and a bite to eat?

218
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,783
I'm sorry, I'm going to have to go,
I've got an appointment!

219
00:22:35,783 --> 00:22:38,367
Oh! Well, I hope that nobody else
has got an appointment!

220
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,783
I'm in for the long hall, Mrs. Wyatt.

221
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,242
Good.

222
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:44,450
No, I hate spelling!

223
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,283
Yeah, me too! Spelling and maths!

224
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:48,617
I was always hopeless at
spelling and maths.

225
00:22:49,742 --> 00:22:50,783
- I like English.
- English?

226
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:51,825
Like stories and stuff?

227
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:53,075
Yeah!

228
00:22:53,075 --> 00:22:54,617
English and Sport!

229
00:22:54,617 --> 00:22:55,450
Well you can't go wrong there.

230
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,117
You can be a Sports journalist.

231
00:22:57,117 --> 00:22:57,867
Really?

232
00:22:57,867 --> 00:22:58,908
I could see you as a
sports journalist.

233
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,283
Well, Dan, you're laughing mate!

234
00:23:01,283 --> 00:23:03,367
Financing this love
as a married couple.

235
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:06,617
You get the first one under your belt,
you pour everything into it.

236
00:23:07,242 --> 00:23:09,325
After that, the minimum equity is
what you're after.

237
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:12,242
You get into as much debt
as possible.

238
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,533
It gives you some focus.

239
00:23:14,533 --> 00:23:18,075
I'm not just talking about
real estate.

240
00:23:18,075 --> 00:23:20,867
I'm talking about a philosophy.

241
00:23:20,992 --> 00:23:23,200
Would you mind...
if you excuse me for a minute?

242
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
No! Sure!!

243
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:30,158
Where are you and Dan going
for the honeymoon?

244
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,450
- More lemonade?
Yeah, thanks!

245
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:37,242
You're so tight!
You're selling next year?

246
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,867
Abbots Road! It's just round
the corner from us!

247
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,200
Geez, that'll be a change, eh?

248
00:23:43,283 --> 00:23:46,617
Yeah, I'd rather go to a state school,
but, it's mom and dad...

249
00:23:46,617 --> 00:23:49,867
<i>Jenny, could you come and help
with sanwiches </i></i>

250
00:23:50,158 --> 00:23:51,533
I'll give you a hand too,
Auntie Cap!

251
00:23:57,367 --> 00:23:59,950
- What?
- What are you doing in there?

252
00:24:00,158 --> 00:24:02,242
Doing a shit.

253
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:04,617
No you're not!

254
00:24:07,867 --> 00:24:09,450
Open the door.

255
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,408
I can't!

256
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,950
<i>You greedy fuckup!!</i></i>

257
00:24:16,617 --> 00:24:18,700
Rather a selfish
way to begin a marriage!

258
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,533
Really! All done!

259
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:25,575
Dick!

260
00:24:25,575 --> 00:24:27,533
<i>Obviously, it was a
big dope weekend! </i></i>

261
00:24:29,325 --> 00:24:31,408
You wanna be relaxed at
your own wedding. </i>

262
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,533
- Sorry about that.
- That's fine!

263
00:24:43,367 --> 00:24:45,450
So where were we?

264
00:24:45,575 --> 00:24:46,283
I was saying, you need to get your t...

265
00:24:46,617 --> 00:24:48,700
- Do you need a seat?
Yeah, sure! Have a seat!

266
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:51,617
You need to get your toe in the
the market, Jim!

267
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:54,200
You know what I'mn saying?
Out of suburbs, fine!

268
00:24:54,742 --> 00:24:56,825
Two bedroom...

269
00:24:56,283 --> 00:24:58,367
...You don't need a garden
courtyard, do you?

270
00:24:58,783 --> 00:25:00,867
You want the worst house,
in the best street!

271
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:04,867
You don't need a kitchen or bathroom...

272
00:25:04,867 --> 00:25:06,408
...Put it in later!

273
00:25:06,825 --> 00:25:08,617
Say for example,
you want to borrow...

274
00:25:08,617 --> 00:25:10,033
...400.

275
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:14,450
Or 300...

276
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:25,158
You do it...
You Struggle...

277
00:25:25,158 --> 00:25:27,242
Understand?

278
00:25:26,533 --> 00:25:28,617
Dan?

279
00:25:29,117 --> 00:25:31,200
Dan?

280
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:33,700
Dan!

281
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,283
Dan...

282
00:25:36,825 --> 00:25:38,908
Wake up.

283
00:25:39,033 --> 00:25:41,117
Dan, Dan, wake up.

284
00:25:42,783 --> 00:25:44,867
I'm fucked.

285
00:25:45,575 --> 00:25:47,658
Too much champagne.

286
00:25:47,867 --> 00:25:49,950
Yeah I'm...
I'm sure it's that...

287
00:25:50,992 --> 00:25:53,200
Well, it is the big day!

288
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,283
<i>I'll make some coffee. </i></i>

289
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,533
<i>He's drunk! </i></i>

290
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:10,575
<i>Is there anything you
want to talk to me about?</i></i>

291
00:26:10,783 --> 00:26:12,867
<i>What? </i></i>

292
00:26:12,867 --> 00:26:14,325
What's going on?

293
00:26:14,325 --> 00:26:15,992
Mum, you know what's going on!

294
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:17,117
We are having a lovely time!

295
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,200
That's not what I meant.

296
00:26:20,283 --> 00:26:22,367
Well then, I don't know what you mean!

297
00:26:23,908 --> 00:26:25,700
What's wrong with Dan?

298
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,533
He's just pissed, Mum!
He's hopeless!!

299
00:26:30,992 --> 00:26:33,075
Sorry.

300
00:26:33,075 --> 00:26:35,158
Thanks for the beautiful reception.

301
00:26:38,908 --> 00:26:42,033
It'd kill your father, you know.

302
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,158
Think we should stop?

303
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,783
- What? Now that we're respectable?
- Yeah, I know!

304
00:27:07,117 --> 00:27:09,200
You know what I mean.

305
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,033
Whenever you say the word.

306
00:27:19,867 --> 00:27:22,450
We are the coolest people
in McDonalds!

307
00:27:28,283 --> 00:27:30,367
<i>We had a lot going for us. </i></i>

308
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:36,408
<i>We'd found the secret glue
that held all things together </i></i>

309
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:40,450
<i>in a perfect place...</i></i>

310
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,658
<i>...where the noise
did not intrude.</i></i>

311
00:27:46,617 --> 00:27:50,700
<i>Our world was...
so very complete. </i></i>

312
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,617
Earth

313
00:28:12,783 --> 00:28:14,867
- Hey baby!
- Hi!

314
00:28:15,158 --> 00:28:17,242
How was it?

315
00:28:17,242 --> 00:28:18,783
About the same.

316
00:28:18,783 --> 00:28:20,700
Here's $200.

317
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,367
I'm gonna give it half an hour
and then I'll split!

318
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,325
Yeah. I won't be long.
I'll meet you at home.

319
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,450
Ok, I see you there.

320
00:28:25,992 --> 00:28:28,075
OK.

321
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:32,367
<i>They say that for every 10 years
you've been a junkie...</i></i>

322
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:35,700
<i>You will have spent 7 of them
...waiting. </i></i>

323
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:41,200
<i>One way is not bad
have as much time to think .</i></i>

324
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:45,450
<i>on the other, the anxiety
was a full time job!</i></i>

325
00:28:59,325 --> 00:29:01,408
- Hey?
- You slimey cunt!

326
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:05,033
- What?
- What do you fucking reckon?

327
00:29:05,033 --> 00:29:07,117
I just had a quick little bit!
It was nothing!

328
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,033
Where?

329
00:29:09,033 --> 00:29:10,575
Um, In the park.
When I met Ange.

330
00:29:10,575 --> 00:29:12,117
Did Angela do it with you?

331
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,200
No, of course not!
We left as soon as we did the deal!

332
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:17,658
Only because he's decent enough
to go home to his girlfriend.
Like you should be!

333
00:29:17,658 --> 00:29:21,283
Oh candy! He sold me the dope!
Why would he want to have a hit
in the public toilet?

334
00:29:21,617 --> 00:29:23,700
Well why the fuck would you?

335
00:29:25,283 --> 00:29:29,117
Oww!
Look, I admit it was dumb!

336
00:29:29,117 --> 00:29:31,200
Okay?

337
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,242
I'm Sorry!

338
00:29:32,242 --> 00:29:34,325
Will you let me make you a nice taste!

339
00:29:34,325 --> 00:29:35,367
I'm getting sick of this, dickhead!

340
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:36,408
What is your problem?

341
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:37,867
You are my problem!

342
00:29:38,075 --> 00:29:39,533
You are a waste of space.

343
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:44,450
Are you getting your period
or something?

344
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,575
No, Dan.

345
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,367
I hardly have my period anymore!

346
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,033
...because my body's
all fucked up!

347
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,533
It's this fucking nightmare
you've led me into!

348
00:29:51,617 --> 00:29:53,700
Oh right! Like I held a
gun to your head! Did I? Eh??

349
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:57,033
Held you down, hit you up, did I?

350
00:29:57,658 --> 00:29:58,700
Fuck You!

351
00:29:59,117 --> 00:30:00,367
Fuck you too, Candy!

352
00:30:01,117 --> 00:30:03,200
Well, Fuck you double then!

353
00:30:33,075 --> 00:30:36,408
Dan, have you noticed, the more
I work, the less I paint?

354
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:40,783
Candy, I don't want a fight! OK?

355
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:43,908
I just don't see what your problem is tonight! I mean...

356
00:30:45,783 --> 00:30:47,867
We've got a life!

357
00:30:47,867 --> 00:30:49,867
It's neither good nor bad! OK?

358
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,783
Do you know... Do you know what I do?

359
00:30:57,117 --> 00:30:59,117
Listen to this, dick fuck!

360
00:30:59,117 --> 00:31:01,117
What do I do all day?

361
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,867
I fuck men I hate!

362
00:31:03,283 --> 00:31:05,283
- Don't do this.
- What are going to do about it?

363
00:31:05,367 --> 00:31:07,033
Look, Okay, that's it! Alright?

364
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:09,200
No more brothels, No more escorts!

365
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,283
- We're gonna take the time to
start a new life!
- You don't understand do you?

366
00:31:11,408 --> 00:31:13,492
That's really it this time.
That's going away!

367
00:31:13,492 --> 00:31:15,367
Maybe I want to keep using!

368
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:17,450
You know, I'm sick of working, yes,
but...

369
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,533
...What if I want to keep using?
What are you gonna do about it?

370
00:31:19,742 --> 00:31:20,783
Candy!

371
00:31:21,283 --> 00:31:22,867
Why don't you ring gay blokes?

372
00:31:23,783 --> 00:31:25,700
You start working!
You hock your ass!

373
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:27,867
Hey, you know you can not do that!

374
00:31:28,908 --> 00:31:30,992
You know, I'll get...
I'll get AIDS!

375
00:31:30,992 --> 00:31:32,867
No you won't, you moron!

376
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,158
You'll make them use condoms,
like everybody else!

377
00:31:35,367 --> 00:31:37,367
I wouldn't know what to do.

378
00:31:37,367 --> 00:31:40,783
You're heterosexual, right? So you're
just doing what you're good at anyway.

379
00:31:40,783 --> 00:31:42,033
Did you even hear what you're saying?

380
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:43,075
Let me fuck women, no problems!

381
00:31:43,075 --> 00:31:47,658
If I can do it with women, I'd make us all the money! You'd never have to work, I swear!

382
00:31:47,658 --> 00:31:49,742
But... These women, they want
muscle types, don't they?

383
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,617
If there was a market out there, I'd
do it, but I don't think there is!

384
00:31:53,617 --> 00:31:55,033
And I'd be hopeless with the gay stuff!
You know that!

385
00:31:55,783 --> 00:31:57,033
You're fucking unbeleivable!

386
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,533
I can't get to sleep with that on.

387
00:32:16,825 --> 00:32:18,908
Can you turn it off?

388
00:32:19,325 --> 00:32:21,408
Candy, it's a really good movie!

389
00:32:22,117 --> 00:32:24,200
I'll turn it down, okay?

390
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:34,117
Anyway, it finishes in half an hour.

391
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,700
Fuck you!

392
00:32:37,783 --> 00:32:39,867
Go to bed.

393
00:32:41,408 --> 00:32:43,492
How can you even hear that?

394
00:32:43,492 --> 00:32:45,158
The light's bugging me!

395
00:32:59,325 --> 00:33:01,408
<i>I can't believe it. </i></i>

396
00:33:01,408 --> 00:33:03,075
<i>I can't fucking believe it. </i></i>

397
00:33:03,617 --> 00:33:05,700
What? I'm not making any noise.

398
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:08,700
The light!

399
00:33:09,117 --> 00:33:11,200
The Light's keeping me awake.

400
00:33:11,283 --> 00:33:13,367
OK, look! I'll cover the light!
Hmm??

401
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,700
There's more light coming from the
workshop than that!

402
00:33:18,783 --> 00:33:20,867
<i>Asshole! </i></i>

403
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:30,575
<i>The pen!! I can hear the pen
scratching on the paper! </i></i>

404
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:33,075
How? This is ridiculous, Candy.

405
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:35,700
You're just looking for an excuse!

406
00:33:36,283 --> 00:33:38,200
Turn off the light and come to bed.

407
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,033
I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore!

408
00:33:40,033 --> 00:33:41,283
Turn the light off!

409
00:33:41,283 --> 00:33:42,867
Nope! I'm not even talking to you!

410
00:33:42,867 --> 00:33:44,325
- TURN THE FUCKING LIGHT OFF!!
- ...Aghhh!

411
00:33:45,992 --> 00:33:48,075
FUCK!!

412
00:33:48,075 --> 00:33:49,117
Oh my God! Oh my God!

413
00:33:49,117 --> 00:33:51,283
- Shit.
- I'm so sorry, Danny!

414
00:33:51,408 --> 00:33:54,200
- What the fuck was that?
- Oh my God! Oh baby! Oh shit!

415
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:56,950
Jesus! It's fuckin' blood!

416
00:33:57,033 --> 00:33:58,075
I didn't mean to hurt you...

417
00:34:02,117 --> 00:34:04,200
Jesus fuckin' shit, alright!.
Fuck!

418
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:07,242
Is there any chance for some morphine?

419
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,783
I'm in a fair bit of pain.

420
00:34:13,783 --> 00:34:15,575
I don't think you need any morphine.

421
00:34:15,867 --> 00:34:17,533
I don't think you're in
much pain at all!

422
00:34:18,492 --> 00:34:20,575
Oh well, it was worth a try!

423
00:34:28,617 --> 00:34:32,117
Excuse me, would you mind if we um,
bought a couple of flavoured milks off you?

424
00:34:32,783 --> 00:34:34,867
- Just take a couple.
- You sure?

425
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:36,117
No worries!

426
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:37,242
- Want some of this?
- Yeah!

427
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:40,992
- Have a good night!
- Thanks.
- Thankyou!

428
00:34:57,117 --> 00:34:59,200
D'you want anymore?

429
00:35:14,742 --> 00:35:16,825
It's been a while.

430
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,992
Yeah! It's been a while.

431
00:35:28,992 --> 00:35:31,075
I'm sorry I hurt your head.

432
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:36,533
I'll get you back!

433
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:05,158
Hello...
Anybody home?

434
00:36:05,867 --> 00:36:07,950
Who the fuck are you?

435
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,742
Yeah, it's me!
Phil.

436
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,950
Phillip Dudley,
from Commercial Realty.

437
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:14,533
I've written to you lately.

438
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:21,700
- What's the problem?
- Well...

439
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:28,075
We've been writing to you about...
Um...

440
00:36:28,075 --> 00:36:32,950
I've got these...
er... hang on...
Er, here they are!

441
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:36,617
Copies of the three letters
we've sent you recently...

442
00:36:37,242 --> 00:36:40,700
Relating to the matter of your er,
rent in arrears.

443
00:36:43,283 --> 00:36:48,908
I'm here to confirm that the 3rd of
these letters is in actual fact a
notice to vacate.

444
00:36:49,533 --> 00:36:51,617
Effective 7 days hence.

445
00:36:52,117 --> 00:36:52,950
Fuck!

446
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,492
Well of course it was...
28 days when you received the letter.

447
00:37:00,033 --> 00:37:03,200
Now, what I'm actually here for today...

448
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,825
is to point out to you the
shortfall owing on the fault
of your bond.

449
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:11,200
Assuming... you've paid no more rent between now and next wednesday...

450
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,700
We've calculated that the shortfall
will be er... $1,125.

451
00:37:16,533 --> 00:37:18,617
Listen, Phillip...

452
00:37:18,783 --> 00:37:20,867
...we're junkies!

453
00:37:20,992 --> 00:37:23,075
I am a hooker!

454
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,283
He's hopeless!

455
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,700
Right now, things are very complicated!
We haven't got any money.

456
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,283
Right.

457
00:37:39,867 --> 00:37:41,408
<i>But it was good...</i></i>

458
00:37:42,117 --> 00:37:43,783
<i>Right when times got tough...</i></i>

459
00:37:43,908 --> 00:37:45,450
<i>There was always Casper. </i></i>

460
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,492
Ah, the young ones!

461
00:37:48,575 --> 00:37:49,617
Hi!

462
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:51,950
<i>Our... port in the storm! </i></i>

463
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:54,117
Don't get overexcited!

464
00:37:54,325 --> 00:37:56,408
<i>...our gingerbread house! </i></i>

465
00:37:56,408 --> 00:38:03,408
For once... Here I come...
Bearing Treats!

466
00:38:14,867 --> 00:38:16,950
So is this it?

467
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:19,533
An honour student didn't show,
so I had an idle hour to fill.

468
00:38:20,283 --> 00:38:22,367
You made that in an hour?

469
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:26,075
Well... Panadine to morphine,
in about an hour and 10!

470
00:38:27,033 --> 00:38:29,325
If you get rid of the paracetamol...

471
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,533
...do a few things...

472
00:38:33,075 --> 00:38:35,783
...and morphine to heroin in 15 minutes.

473
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,283
Thankyou, you guys!

474
00:38:40,783 --> 00:38:42,117
Rearrange the atoms...

475
00:38:43,367 --> 00:38:44,450
...take a bit off...

476
00:38:45,575 --> 00:38:46,533
...put a bit on...

477
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,117
Liquid Diamorphine...

478
00:38:49,242 --> 00:38:53,492
Commonly known as heroin,
pharmaceutical grade, pure.

479
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,783
I call it "My Yellow Jesus!"

480
00:38:57,658 --> 00:38:59,742
Papa bear.

481
00:38:59,742 --> 00:39:01,617
Mama bear.

482
00:39:02,783 --> 00:39:04,867
Baby bear.

483
00:39:49,117 --> 00:39:54,117
<i>It's just that... Candy says I
have to start pulling my weight! </i></i>

484
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,283
Yeah.

485
00:40:03,617 --> 00:40:06,408
What do you know about gay escorts?

486
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:09,617
Growth market.

487
00:40:12,783 --> 00:40:16,117
Would you mind if asked you a few
technical questions?

488
00:40:19,325 --> 00:40:22,117
There's nothing I'd rather
discuss with you!

489
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,450
What do they expect you to do?

490
00:40:28,075 --> 00:40:30,033
Well there's a big down in the park!

491
00:40:30,033 --> 00:40:33,617
Why don't you pop down
and do some research!

492
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:36,200
I mean...

493
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:42,867
If they pay you, would they
expect you to have a stiffie?

494
00:40:45,575 --> 00:40:47,658
It Helps!

495
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,908
I don't think I could manage that.

496
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,283
I'm just washing my hands.

497
00:42:00,283 --> 00:42:01,283
Alright!

498
00:42:01,408 --> 00:42:03,200
He'll cancel his cards.

499
00:42:03,283 --> 00:42:04,825
Not if I get to him first.

500
00:42:08,075 --> 00:42:12,658
M. Ro. Roger. Rog. Rogie baby!
Roger, Donald.

501
00:42:12,658 --> 00:42:14,742
R.D. Here it is!

502
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:19,200
R.D. Moylan,
48 Charles Street, Petersham.

503
00:42:19,325 --> 00:42:21,408
He'll trace the call.

504
00:42:21,408 --> 00:42:23,825
That's why they invented
prepaid phones.

505
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,033
Ah, Hi! Roger?

506
00:42:27,867 --> 00:42:29,950
Is that Roger Moylan?

507
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:34,533
Yeah, Look! Look, This is hard...

508
00:42:34,533 --> 00:42:38,158
I'm the guy who stole your wallet.

509
00:42:39,117 --> 00:42:41,408
Yep! No, hold on! I'm sorry, okay?
That's why I'm calling! I'm really sorry!

510
00:42:41,533 --> 00:42:45,783
I just... I was after some money,
I saw some cash... and you had none...

511
00:42:45,867 --> 00:42:47,867
I want to give your wallet back!

512
00:42:47,867 --> 00:42:52,450
No, I know! I feel so stupid!
It's just that I'm...

513
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:55,575
I'm so lonely right now...

514
00:42:55,575 --> 00:42:58,200
I've got no money,
I've just come from Adelaide...

515
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,867
And I've got no friends...

516
00:43:00,992 --> 00:43:03,158
You know, I saw the wallet on the seat, and I took it! I wasn't thinking!

517
00:43:03,158 --> 00:43:05,158
And I'm not interested in your
credit cards.

518
00:43:05,158 --> 00:43:07,950
I just want to do the right thing
and give it back to you.

519
00:43:09,742 --> 00:43:11,617
Uhh... Well, no! I mean now's not a good time, I...

520
00:43:11,617 --> 00:43:14,325
I'm a little bit nervous about
this whole thing anyway!

521
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:17,117
Can we just...
Let's meet in the morning!

522
00:43:17,367 --> 00:43:19,200
What...
What time do you go to work?

523
00:43:20,867 --> 00:43:22,950
So you're in Petersham, right?

524
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:26,617
Umm... Isn't there a footie oval down
there or something?

525
00:43:27,533 --> 00:43:30,033
How about we meet out in front of
the greyhound stand?

526
00:43:31,117 --> 00:43:32,450
9:30? Is that good?

527
00:43:34,533 --> 00:43:36,950
Well I'll be wearing a
blue baseball cap!

528
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:41,283
Look! look, Take my number!

529
00:43:41,825 --> 00:43:43,908
You got a pen?
Yep, Right...

530
00:43:43,908 --> 00:43:51,533
- 0422844881
- [That's my Plumber's!]

531
00:43:51,533 --> 00:43:53,617
Yes, 881.

532
00:43:53,617 --> 00:43:58,283
Well, have you got...
a mobile just in case there's a...

533
00:43:58,283 --> 00:44:03,367
Yeah... Yeah!
Hey, Tell me one thing...

534
00:44:03,492 --> 00:44:06,950
How did you manage to get such a
cute photo on your license?

535
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:10,367
I'm Sorry! Yeah, I'm sorry,
I go too far!

536
00:44:12,867 --> 00:44:14,950
Alright! 9:30 then!
I'll see you then!

537
00:44:16,533 --> 00:44:18,908
Alright, Thanks Rog!
Okay, bye!

538
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:25,033
Imagine if you'd turned your powers
to the benefit of mankind... Dan!

539
00:44:25,867 --> 00:44:27,950
Does this look like me?

540
00:44:28,492 --> 00:44:30,575
Not even remotely.

541
00:44:31,825 --> 00:44:33,908
I could use these!

542
00:44:36,533 --> 00:44:38,617
And a bit of...

543
00:44:39,117 --> 00:44:41,200
...How about now?

544
00:44:43,075 --> 00:44:45,158
Caucasian man with glasses.

545
00:44:46,408 --> 00:44:47,950
Yes!

546
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:56,117
I felt like Tarzan,
at fuckin' last!

547
00:44:56,117 --> 00:44:59,033
I had to hunt down some
food for Jane.

548
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:02,950
I knew it was in my power
to do something brave.

549
00:45:54,742 --> 00:45:56,825
Yeah...

550
00:45:56,825 --> 00:45:58,908
Can we talk about this
when you get back to the office?

551
00:45:58,908 --> 00:46:01,200
20 minutes... Okay, bye!

552
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,200
Sorry about that!

553
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,533
Good morning,
How are you?

554
00:46:04,533 --> 00:46:06,200
Ah, good!
How are you?

555
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,867
Good.

556
00:46:07,867 --> 00:46:10,450
I just uh, wanted to check my
current balance on this please!

557
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:13,200
Okay, I'll just need to get you to
enter in your PIN...

558
00:46:16,283 --> 00:46:18,367
Oh God, I'm...
terrible with this!

559
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:22,450
God! Do you ever have trouble
remembering your PIN?

560
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:26,283
You'd be surprised at the number of
people who forget them.

561
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,908
Yeah I know!
That's why I came inside...

562
00:46:28,908 --> 00:46:30,867
Because I couldn't remember it
out at the ATM, and I thought...

563
00:46:30,867 --> 00:46:33,700
You know I could just er..
If I had ID?

564
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:38,783
No! I'm sorry, you need your PIN
number for all transactions. It's...

565
00:46:38,783 --> 00:46:40,575
It's one of those security things!

566
00:46:40,575 --> 00:46:42,783
No! Of course, of course!
I understand. Um...

567
00:46:44,033 --> 00:46:46,117
So you can't just...

568
00:46:46,533 --> 00:46:47,783
I really can't!

569
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:53,783
Hello?

570
00:46:53,783 --> 00:46:55,867
- Mr. Moylan?
- Yes?

571
00:46:56,117 --> 00:46:58,200
- Mr. Roger Moylan?
- Yes?

572
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:03,200
Roger Moylan, This is Ewan Douglas
from the Commonwealth Bank
Security division...

573
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,200
Yes? Is something the matter?

574
00:47:06,408 --> 00:47:11,533
We've been tracking some unusual
activity on your credit card, in
the last 24 hours...

575
00:47:11,533 --> 00:47:12,533
Oh no!

576
00:47:12,533 --> 00:47:15,158
When was the last time
you used your Master Card?

577
00:47:15,158 --> 00:47:19,533
Um, look! I think my wallet was
stolen last night...

578
00:47:19,533 --> 00:47:22,242
Did you report it missing?

579
00:47:23,492 --> 00:47:25,575
I was just calling now!

580
00:47:25,575 --> 00:47:27,117
<i>But I called you. </i></i>

581
00:47:27,117 --> 00:47:28,908
Um, I mean I was about to call.

582
00:47:29,533 --> 00:47:34,533
Sir, Mr. Moylan, I'm going to have to
verify your details for a security check.

583
00:47:34,533 --> 00:47:36,700
Would you please tell me your
Date of Birth?

584
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,742
Um... 13th of March, 1977.

585
00:47:39,742 --> 00:47:42,242
Mother's Maiden Name?

586
00:47:42,242 --> 00:47:44,200
Er, Lynch.

587
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:45,783
Number of security?

588
00:47:45,783 --> 00:47:49,950
Is that like your PIN number?

589
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:54,325
Well, it shouldn't be...
but you often find that it is!

590
00:47:54,325 --> 00:48:00,158
Umm...
Try... 3279

591
00:48:16,617 --> 00:48:20,283
It's just one of those days, you know... where everythings just gone!

592
00:48:20,283 --> 00:48:22,533
It happens all the time!

593
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:25,700
Um, but listen... I've already got my daily limit out from the ATM outside...

594
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:29,867
...But I actually need more, because
I'm trying to buy this beautiful old Mercedes...

595
00:48:29,867 --> 00:48:31,533
...you know, the cream ones,
you know, the TLS?

596
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:34,033
Anyway, the guy's willing to negotiate for cash...

597
00:48:40,992 --> 00:48:43,075
...$2247.

598
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,783
God, we're going to be
in the poor house!

599
00:48:45,992 --> 00:48:48,075
...and 50 cents.

600
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:50,992
Never get sentimental about a car!

601
00:48:55,575 --> 00:48:59,117
I might just get you to check the
available credit on this card...

602
00:49:00,575 --> 00:49:02,658
I can get a cash advance, can't I?

603
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,783
Candy? Candy!

604
00:49:07,783 --> 00:49:09,867
I did it! I did it!
I fucking did it, baby!

605
00:49:11,617 --> 00:49:13,700
I fucking did it!

606
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,617
God, You... are going to fucking LOVE me for this...

607
00:49:16,617 --> 00:49:18,492
7 Grand!!

608
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,867
Oh god! You should have seen it!
I was fucking great! It was like...

609
00:49:21,408 --> 00:49:23,492
It was like that movie
we saw with that...

610
00:49:23,492 --> 00:49:27,367
God, what was his name,
that actor we like?

611
00:49:27,367 --> 00:49:29,117
...and he gets all that money,
and he walks in and he's all coool,
and stuf like that...
- Danny!

612
00:49:29,117 --> 00:49:37,450
I'm pregnant.

613
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,783
Shit.

614
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,783
Candy.

615
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:57,950
Crap.

616
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:01,283
It couldn't be, uh...

617
00:50:06,117 --> 00:50:07,117
No.

618
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:09,533
We never broke a condom.

619
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,783
I'd know.

620
00:50:13,367 --> 00:50:15,450
It was the night
I broke your skull.

621
00:50:17,867 --> 00:50:19,950
How fucking weird.

622
00:50:20,367 --> 00:50:22,450
One night.

623
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,283
I can get an abortion.

624
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:31,200
No.

625
00:50:31,617 --> 00:50:33,700
No, no way!

626
00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:36,117
This is good.

627
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:38,700
It was meant to be.

628
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:41,533
This is what we need.

629
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,783
We've got to stop using.

630
00:50:50,367 --> 00:50:51,617
Yeah.

631
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:55,367
Yeah, of course.

632
00:51:03,908 --> 00:51:05,158
Sugar?

633
00:51:06,617 --> 00:51:07,867
Two, please.

634
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:12,450
We've got some news everybody...

635
00:51:15,283 --> 00:51:17,658
We're having a baby.

636
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:26,950
Ah, Darling!

637
00:52:09,617 --> 00:52:11,700
Candice, Good God.

638
00:52:17,867 --> 00:52:22,033
We just wanted you to know that
we've made some decisions. and uh...

639
00:52:22,783 --> 00:52:24,867
We've been putting some money aside,
haven't we?

640
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:27,867
We're going to get out of that
whole warehouse environment.

641
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,033
...and live in a proper house.

642
00:52:30,367 --> 00:52:32,367
Yeah! We really want to raise
our child in the...

643
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,700
...in a proper home.

644
00:52:36,617 --> 00:52:38,700
Have you told your parents?

645
00:52:40,867 --> 00:52:42,450
No.

646
00:52:45,867 --> 00:52:47,950
Day 1

647
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,783
We knew what we had
to do.

648
00:52:55,283 --> 00:52:58,200
It takes alot of planning to stop.

649
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:05,033
Lucky at last!
We can really do this, Candy.

650
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,783
It's going to be hard, but...

651
00:53:10,992 --> 00:53:13,075
I'm sure it's like a bridge...

652
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,700
And once we cross it,
everything will be okay.

653
00:53:18,617 --> 00:53:20,700
You can get back into your
painting again...

654
00:53:21,117 --> 00:53:23,200
Maybe we'll move to the country...

655
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:25,450
Grow some veggies...

656
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:26,950
Feed the chickens...

657
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:31,533
We could go live in Thailand...

658
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,533
Thailand would be great,
if we didn't use.

659
00:53:40,575 --> 00:53:42,658
Or the Himalayas.

660
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:46,533
We'll go canoeing...

661
00:53:46,617 --> 00:53:48,700
A bit of white water rafting...

662
00:53:53,367 --> 00:53:56,950
Get healthy, sleep well...

663
00:53:57,533 --> 00:54:00,158
...not have drugs in our system.

664
00:54:02,033 --> 00:54:04,117
How good would that be?

665
00:54:09,742 --> 00:54:11,825
We really have to do this.

666
00:54:14,033 --> 00:54:16,117
We have to do it this time.

667
00:54:16,533 --> 00:54:18,617
Yeah, we will.

668
00:54:19,617 --> 00:54:21,700
We are.

669
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,283
We're really fuckin' doing it!

670
00:55:30,575 --> 00:55:32,658
Day 2

671
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:50,033
Day 4

672
00:58:57,783 --> 00:58:59,867
I can't do it.

673
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:02,533
I can't do it.

674
00:59:02,533 --> 00:59:04,950
Hey!
Come back to bed.

675
00:59:05,158 --> 00:59:07,242
Alright? You'll catch a cold.

676
00:59:34,325 --> 00:59:36,408
Casper, It's Candy.

677
00:59:36,408 --> 00:59:38,200
Ring me as soon as you get this.

678
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,450
We've tried your mobile.

679
00:59:43,367 --> 00:59:46,533
I know we said to ignore us while
we did this, but...

680
00:59:46,533 --> 00:59:48,075
3 days...

681
00:59:50,783 --> 00:59:53,075
...we did pretty well, but
we're not feeling so great now.

682
00:59:53,075 --> 00:59:55,575
We don't want you to ignore us now.

683
00:59:57,450 --> 00:59:59,533
Are you there?

684
01:00:01,117 --> 01:00:03,200
Pick up if you're there.

685
01:00:04,325 --> 01:00:06,408
Pick up!

686
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,283
Okay, you're not there.

687
01:00:11,283 --> 01:00:12,950
Call us!!

688
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:14,200
Shit! Shit!

689
01:00:15,283 --> 01:00:16,283
Shit! Shit! Shit!

690
01:00:22,367 --> 01:00:24,450
Kojak? It's Candy!

691
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,533
Um... Shit, not so good.

692
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:32,783
I'm really sick. I mean...

693
01:00:32,783 --> 01:00:34,950
We just need credit.

694
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:37,658
Uh... I can work a shift,
and then I can pay you back.

695
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:42,450
Yeah, well if I work a shift,
then I can pay that too.

696
01:00:44,617 --> 01:00:46,617
I can't work when I'm this sick!

697
01:00:48,367 --> 01:00:50,450
Ok, bye.

698
01:00:50,783 --> 01:00:52,867
Fucking cunt!!

699
01:00:54,325 --> 01:00:56,408
Candy.

700
01:00:57,783 --> 01:01:02,033
- Candy.
- Oh God!

701
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:04,117
Answer!
Answer, please!

702
01:01:08,283 --> 01:01:10,867
He was just about to answer!

703
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:19,450
- Give me the phone.
- I want the fucking phone!

704
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:20,450
Don't fucking take it away from me!
No! No!!

705
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:28,367
- We can do it.
- No! Get away!! Nooooo!!

706
01:01:28,367 --> 01:01:30,450
Candy, you're bleeding.

707
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,242
Candy, you're bleeding.

708
01:01:32,367 --> 01:01:34,450
Why are you bleeding?

709
01:01:40,283 --> 01:01:43,700
The water has broken.
Her cervix has dilated.

710
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:46,283
This is what we didn't
want to happen.

711
01:01:47,033 --> 01:01:49,533
We call this an
inevitable miscarriage.

712
01:01:49,533 --> 01:01:50,575
There's no going back.

713
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:55,700
As I was explaining to Candy,
she's going to have to go through
a kind of... labour!

714
01:01:56,283 --> 01:02:00,283
I don't know however long that takes, you need to know that at this state of
the pregnancy...

715
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:02,033
...the baby is not going to survive.

716
01:02:03,367 --> 01:02:04,950
I'm Sorry.

717
01:02:46,825 --> 01:02:48,908
Give me pethidine!

718
01:02:48,908 --> 01:02:50,450
I want pethidine!

719
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,658
Will you give her the fucking
pethidine, or what?

720
01:02:53,075 --> 01:02:55,158
She's fucking in pain,
can't you see this?

721
01:03:09,325 --> 01:03:11,408
That's it! Candy, push!

722
01:03:12,867 --> 01:03:14,950
Almost there!
Push!
That's it!!

723
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,283
Can I hold it?

724
01:03:56,825 --> 01:03:59,033
Doctor, it's leg moved.

725
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:00,450
It's just a spasm.

726
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:01,283
It moved!

727
01:04:01,283 --> 01:04:03,367
It's just a spasm.

728
01:05:08,617 --> 01:05:11,200
Hell

729
01:05:56,117 --> 01:05:58,200
- How much did you get?
-50.

730
01:06:00,158 --> 01:06:02,242
That guy is still back there.

731
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:05,158
- Maybe you'll sell some. Yeah?
- Alright.

732
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:12,033
<i>Everything we ever did...</i></i>

733
01:06:12,533 --> 01:06:14,617
<i>we did with the best
of intentions... </i></i>

734
01:06:15,033 --> 01:06:19,450
<i>But.. events tumble!
and the years pile up.</i></i>

735
01:06:19,533 --> 01:06:24,033
<i>The world is very bewildering
to a junkie. </i></i>

736
01:06:27,242 --> 01:06:29,325
Yeah, we're all good!

737
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:44,200
- Well... Tastes bad.
- Fuck!

738
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,283
Here you go.

739
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:50,783
Do you feel anything?

740
01:06:51,533 --> 01:06:53,075
No.

741
01:06:57,033 --> 01:06:59,117
- Shit!
- Shit!

742
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:09,033
<i>and still... you cling to
the concept of change. </i></i>

743
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,783
Hey, Schumann...

744
01:07:20,783 --> 01:07:23,200
...we are thinking of moving
up the country for a while.

745
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,950
Give methadone a try.

746
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:29,533
What the fuck difference
would it make?

747
01:07:37,867 --> 01:07:40,783
The air's cleaner, for one.

748
01:08:37,867 --> 01:08:39,950
It's a kitchen.

749
01:08:47,117 --> 01:08:49,200
It's a bit dark, isn't it?

750
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,283
Yeah.

751
01:08:51,283 --> 01:08:53,367
Yeah, we Could um...

752
01:08:53,367 --> 01:08:58,617
knock out a hole...
and put a skylight.

753
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:18,283
I love you.

754
01:09:52,783 --> 01:09:54,867
Any frozen peas?

755
01:09:55,367 --> 01:09:56,950
No.

756
01:09:59,867 --> 01:10:00,992
I got one!
There he is!

757
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:03,783
It was all the way down
in the turbo frost.

758
01:10:12,367 --> 01:10:14,450
I can not believe you didn't do
this, this morning.

759
01:10:14,742 --> 01:10:16,825
What time are they coming?

760
01:10:16,825 --> 01:10:18,617
Fuck!!

761
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:35,992
What's the date?

762
01:10:35,992 --> 01:10:38,492
Oh no, this expired a month ago.

763
01:10:42,533 --> 01:10:44,117
Look at that! It smells bad!

764
01:10:44,617 --> 01:10:46,700
- That's got that kind of chicken smell!
- Yeah it does doesn't it!

765
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:52,950
Not to worry, we'll just
baste it in lots of stuff!
Like uh...

766
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:55,033
Basil, uh... honey?
Bayleaves or something?

767
01:10:55,450 --> 01:10:57,533
What's in the cupboard?

768
01:10:58,283 --> 01:11:00,367
What do you put on a roast?

769
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:08,492
How long did it take you to
get out here?

770
01:11:08,992 --> 01:11:11,075
Oh, About an hour and 40 minutes?
Dear?

771
01:11:15,575 --> 01:11:17,658
Yeah, about... 40? 45?

772
01:11:20,908 --> 01:11:22,450
Much traffic?

773
01:11:22,533 --> 01:11:24,617
No, pretty good run really.

774
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:27,033
Can't complain.

775
01:11:29,242 --> 01:11:31,908
It's so beautiful here,
the drive down was so beautiful.

776
01:11:31,908 --> 01:11:35,283
Yeah, it's...
Countryside.

777
01:11:39,658 --> 01:11:41,742
Had any news on the job front?

778
01:11:43,075 --> 01:11:47,992
Um... Well it's pretty...
There's not much work around here.
We're getting by on the dole.

779
01:11:48,492 --> 01:11:51,533
Well, apparently I might be able to
get some work hay bailing.

780
01:11:52,158 --> 01:11:54,242
Hay bailing?

781
01:11:54,825 --> 01:11:56,908
- Ooooh! Tough work, hay bailing!
- Yeah.

782
01:12:01,075 --> 01:12:03,075
So! What can I do in the kitchen?

783
01:12:03,158 --> 01:12:05,158
Nothing mum, really!
It's fine!

784
01:12:05,158 --> 01:12:06,825
Nonsense, there must be something
I can do to help.

785
01:12:07,117 --> 01:12:08,700
Everything's under control.

786
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,575
The oven's heating up.

787
01:12:13,367 --> 01:12:15,283
We're running a bit behind.

788
01:12:15,867 --> 01:12:16,950
<i>No worries, mate. </i></i>

789
01:12:18,617 --> 01:12:21,700
Oh This is unbelievable.
You go to all this trouble
to invite us up here...

790
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:25,158
...and you can't even manage the
simple decency of getting the meal
together on time!

791
01:12:25,367 --> 01:12:26,825
Get off my case, mum!

792
01:12:26,825 --> 01:12:28,158
Is not food that's even the issue here.

793
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:29,533
It's your attitude!

794
01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:32,117
Okay, let's just calm down.
Lunch will be ready in less than an hour.

795
01:12:32,117 --> 01:12:33,200
Who wants some wine?

796
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:36,825
That chicken is rock solid!

797
01:12:36,825 --> 01:12:39,325
We're not going to be eating before
midnight.

798
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:40,658
And where are the vegetables?

799
01:12:40,658 --> 01:12:41,700
Hey hey, Let's all calm down, honey.

800
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:44,533
What do you think is about?

801
01:12:45,158 --> 01:12:48,200
Sunday Lunch.
It's a pretty simple thing.

802
01:12:48,908 --> 01:12:51,075
But with you two, there's no
such thing as simple.

803
01:12:51,408 --> 01:12:52,450
The drugs!

804
01:12:53,075 --> 01:12:55,575
The drugs always come first.

805
01:12:55,867 --> 01:12:57,658
Hey no, that is not true.

806
01:12:57,783 --> 01:12:59,950
We're doing really well now.

807
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:03,783
Do you have any idea...

808
01:13:05,658 --> 01:13:09,117
...what you have done to my family?

809
01:13:10,450 --> 01:13:12,533
To me?

810
01:13:13,992 --> 01:13:17,117
What happened to that beautiful girl?

811
01:13:17,658 --> 01:13:19,742
What happened?

812
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:22,033
What happened?

813
01:13:22,658 --> 01:13:24,742
Can't you see?

814
01:13:25,783 --> 01:13:27,867
Don't you understand?

815
01:13:28,367 --> 01:13:33,617
I have been clutching my fucking fists
since I was 6 years old.

816
01:13:34,617 --> 01:13:36,700
Look at my fucking fists!
Look at them!

817
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,283
Look at them, you fucking bitch!

818
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:43,783
Don't you understand?

819
01:13:44,867 --> 01:13:47,867
No! I gotta clench my hands!

820
01:13:50,283 --> 01:13:51,617
I gotta clench my hands!
I can't relax.

821
01:13:54,617 --> 01:13:58,200
Darling, darling! Look!
It's been a big move.

822
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,242
It's been a big year.

823
01:13:59,825 --> 01:14:01,117
There's been lots of changes.

824
01:14:02,242 --> 01:14:04,117
C'mon, you've lost a child.

825
01:14:04,117 --> 01:14:07,117
But you ARE getting your lives together.
I can see that!

826
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:10,033
Just go.

827
01:14:11,117 --> 01:14:12,325
Fuck off.

828
01:14:13,617 --> 01:14:15,283
Forget lunch.

829
01:14:18,575 --> 01:14:20,658
Can we?

830
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,283
Can we cancel the lunch?

831
01:14:24,033 --> 01:14:26,117
Maybe we can just make
this another day.

832
01:14:27,242 --> 01:14:30,367
Today is just a bad day.
I'm sorry.

833
01:14:41,117 --> 01:14:43,200
I'm scared.

834
01:14:46,408 --> 01:14:48,492
There's nothing to be scared of.

835
01:14:53,283 --> 01:14:55,367
There's nothing to be scared of.

836
01:15:01,533 --> 01:15:03,617
D'you think we're going to end?

837
01:15:06,283 --> 01:15:08,367
- We'll never end.
- It'll end.

838
01:15:16,825 --> 01:15:18,908
It's not gonna work.

839
01:15:34,950 --> 01:15:37,033
Is that the flu vaccine?

840
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:39,117
It's medicine.

841
01:15:40,575 --> 01:15:42,658
It's leading us not into temptation.

842
01:15:47,658 --> 01:15:49,742
Hey Candy, check out this.

843
01:15:49,742 --> 01:15:51,742
Brickie's labourer.

844
01:15:52,117 --> 01:15:54,200
- I'll give it a call, eh.
- Why don't you do that.

845
01:16:57,033 --> 01:16:59,117
- Hi.
- Hey!

846
01:17:05,867 --> 01:17:07,950
This is Paul.
He lives up the road.

847
01:17:11,117 --> 01:17:13,200
Good day.

848
01:17:13,492 --> 01:17:15,575
He's got some good home grow.

849
01:17:15,575 --> 01:17:17,658
Great.
Can I get some more?

850
01:17:20,283 --> 01:17:22,367
Um... There is none left.

851
01:17:29,325 --> 01:17:31,408
Then I'll grab a beer.

852
01:17:31,408 --> 01:17:33,075
There's none of that either.

853
01:17:38,783 --> 01:17:40,867
I'm gonna go and get some more pot.

854
01:17:42,242 --> 01:17:44,325
Uh.. We gonna grab some dinner,
or What?

855
01:17:44,325 --> 01:17:46,117
No, you eat! I'll be fine.

856
01:17:47,783 --> 01:17:49,867
You want some money?
I got paid.

857
01:17:49,867 --> 01:17:51,617
- No.
- No, it's okay mate.

858
01:18:54,117 --> 01:18:56,200
Where were you?

859
01:18:56,533 --> 01:18:58,617
Don't you fuck this one with
your negative comments.

860
01:19:01,408 --> 01:19:03,492
What are you doing?

861
01:19:03,492 --> 01:19:05,367
Going back to my art.

862
01:19:05,367 --> 01:19:07,575
Does not mean anything to you?

863
01:19:07,867 --> 01:19:09,950
Have you been fuckingt that guy?

864
01:19:12,533 --> 01:19:14,617
You do not know what
you're talking about.

865
01:19:14,617 --> 01:19:16,700
Where have you been all night?

866
01:19:16,825 --> 01:19:18,575
Away from you.

867
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:22,658
You fucked him, didn't you?

868
01:19:27,367 --> 01:19:29,450
Firstly...

869
01:19:30,158 --> 01:19:32,242
...You do not know what
you're talking about.

870
01:19:33,492 --> 01:19:35,575
Secondly...

871
01:19:34,867 --> 01:19:36,950
...I hate the sound of your voice.

872
01:19:38,367 --> 01:19:39,408
Thirdly...

873
01:19:40,450 --> 01:19:42,033
...Why don't you just fuck off?

874
01:19:45,575 --> 01:19:47,658
I mean, really!

875
01:19:49,033 --> 01:19:51,117
Fuck off!

876
01:20:14,450 --> 01:20:17,367
Wakey wakey.
Hands off snakey!

877
01:20:19,742 --> 01:20:21,825
What the fuck is that?

878
01:20:21,825 --> 01:20:24,117
A statement of fact.
What do you think it is?

879
01:20:24,117 --> 01:20:26,200
And what's this with your mother anyway?

880
01:20:28,283 --> 01:20:30,367
Well if it's not her...

881
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:31,200
...Then you.

882
01:20:31,408 --> 01:20:32,450
Great.

883
01:20:32,783 --> 01:20:34,867
Okay,
...You.

884
01:20:41,117 --> 01:20:45,700
You think you're so smart,
but youre just fuckin' mad!

885
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:51,408
That's really good, Candy.

886
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:53,492
That's good, glad you think that.

887
01:21:05,033 --> 01:21:07,117
Your a fuckin' poet!

888
01:22:32,533 --> 01:22:34,617
<i>Once upon a time, there was
a Candy and Dan... </i></i>

889
01:22:37,783 --> 01:22:39,867
<i>Things were very hot
that year... </i></i>

890
01:22:40,658 --> 01:22:42,742
<i>All the wax was melting
on the trees... </i></i>

891
01:22:44,533 --> 01:22:49,117
<i>He would crawl on balconies,
climb everywhere. Do anything
for her... </i></i>

892
01:22:49,617 --> 01:22:51,700
<i>My Danny boy. </i></i>

893
01:22:53,617 --> 01:22:57,325
<i>Thousands of birds. The
tiniest birds adorned her hair... </i></i>

894
01:22:57,950 --> 01:23:00,033
<i>Everything was golden... </i></i>

895
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:03,283
<i>One night the bed caught fire... </i></i>

896
01:23:04,867 --> 01:23:08,283
<i>He was handsome, and a
very good criminal... </i></i>

897
01:23:09,033 --> 01:23:11,117
<i>We lived on sunlight and
chocolate bars... </i></i>

898
01:23:15,367 --> 01:23:17,450
<i>It was the afternoon of
extravagant delight... </i></i>

899
01:23:19,658 --> 01:23:21,742
<i>Danny, the Daredevil... </i></i>

900
01:23:22,117 --> 01:23:24,033
<i>Candy the blessing... </i></i>

901
01:23:25,283 --> 01:23:29,200
<i>The day's last rays of sunshine
cruise like sharks... </i></i>

902
01:23:29,742 --> 01:23:32,242
<i>"I wanna try it your
way this time!"</i></i>

903
01:23:39,617 --> 01:23:43,283
<i>You came into my life
really fast, and I liked it. </i></i>

904
01:23:43,783 --> 01:23:45,867
<i>We squelched in the mud of
our joy. </i></i>

905
01:23:47,950 --> 01:23:50,033
<i>I was wet thighed
with the surrender... </i></i>

906
01:23:51,408 --> 01:23:53,492
<i>Then there was a gap in things... </i></i>

907
01:23:54,117 --> 01:23:56,200
<i>And the whole earth tilted... </i></i>

908
01:23:56,283 --> 01:23:58,367
<i>This is the business.
This is what we're after. </i></i>

909
01:23:59,033 --> 01:24:00,700
<i>With you inside me...
Comes the night...</i></i>

910
01:24:00,783 --> 01:24:02,450
<i>... never again sleep...</i></i>

911
01:24:02,658 --> 01:24:03,992
<i>... a monster in the pool...</i></i>

912
01:24:05,033 --> 01:24:07,658
<i>... Part of the
black nature, to board...</i></i>

913
01:24:07,658 --> 01:24:09,325
<i>... chickens and runnerbeans...</i></i>

914
01:24:09,325 --> 01:24:10,367
<i>... everywhere I looked...</i></i>

915
01:24:10,367 --> 01:24:12,658
<i>... sometimes I hate you...</i></i>

916
01:24:12,658 --> 01:24:13,700
<i>... Friday... </i></i>

917
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:14,742
<i>... I didn't mean that...</i></i>

918
01:24:18,367 --> 01:24:19,867
<i>storm... years...
... sometimes I hate you...</i></i>

919
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:32,783
<i>... a box of flowers by the bed...</i></i>

920
01:24:33,617 --> 01:24:34,867
<i>... I broke your head...</i></i>

921
01:24:35,033 --> 01:24:37,117
<i>... from the back of the bed...</i></i>

922
01:24:37,242 --> 01:24:39,325
<i>... the baby died in the morning...</i></i>

923
01:24:40,283 --> 01:24:42,367
<i>... I gave him a name...</i></i>

924
01:24:44,325 --> 01:24:46,408
<i>... His name was Thomas...</i></i>

925
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:49,033
<i>...Poor little guy... </i></i>

926
01:24:49,825 --> 01:24:52,533
<i>... his heart pounds
like a voodoo drum...</i></i>

927
01:25:33,908 --> 01:25:39,242
My name is Daniel, I'm an addict.
I'm clean today, but not for much longer.

928
01:25:40,158 --> 01:25:42,242
Get out.

929
01:25:44,117 --> 01:25:47,242
I suppose I should do just that.

930
01:26:05,158 --> 01:26:07,242
I am in my house Casper.

931
01:28:30,992 --> 01:28:33,075
Promise me you'll stop.

932
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:38,283
Promise me you'll stop
before me.

933
01:29:02,450 --> 01:29:05,575
<i>can talk to Dan Cutter,
Please? It's Jim Wyatt here. </i></i>

934
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:09,033
Yeah Jim, it's me.

935
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:11,283
Hi! Candy's in the hospital.

936
01:29:12,658 --> 01:29:14,742
What?

937
01:29:14,867 --> 01:29:18,200
<i>She's suffered a bit of a nervous breakdown. </i></i>

938
01:29:37,242 --> 01:29:39,325
It's funny where it all ends up
isn't it?

939
01:30:23,158 --> 01:30:25,242
Candy.

940
01:30:27,117 --> 01:30:29,200
You okay?

941
01:30:50,867 --> 01:30:52,950
I was so frightened.

942
01:30:53,075 --> 01:30:55,158
Sorry.

943
01:30:57,533 --> 01:30:59,617
I didn't really understand
what was happening.

944
01:31:06,283 --> 01:31:08,367
Candy?

945
01:31:15,033 --> 01:31:17,117
Everything's dead.

946
01:31:21,825 --> 01:31:23,908
Everything's turning blue.

947
01:31:52,867 --> 01:31:54,950
It's hard through all this you know.

948
01:32:00,283 --> 01:32:03,617
I don't care how wrong you've
been living about your years.

949
01:32:03,617 --> 01:32:22,033
I care about my daughter.

950
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:25,033
What?

951
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:27,783
Whatever you're capable of...
whatever she needs...

952
01:32:31,617 --> 01:32:33,700
Come on, we'll take you home.

953
01:33:00,450 --> 01:33:02,533
Let him go.

954
01:34:55,283 --> 01:34:57,367
<i>And that was it... </i></i>

955
01:34:57,950 --> 01:35:00,033
<i>That was all that was
scattered to the winds... </i></i>

956
01:35:01,117 --> 01:35:03,200
<i>Casper was gone... </i></i>

957
01:35:03,367 --> 01:35:05,450
<i>Schumann was lost... </i></i>

958
01:35:05,867 --> 01:35:08,367
<i>Candy was off getting better... </i></i>

959
01:35:08,783 --> 01:35:10,867
<i>The coast... </i></i>

960
01:35:10,867 --> 01:35:12,783
<i>Rehab... </i></i>

961
01:35:12,783 --> 01:35:14,200
<i>And I...
Was...</i></i>

962
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:16,950
<i>I was just...</i></i>

963
01:35:17,367 --> 01:35:18,492
The washer, Dan.

964
01:35:18,492 --> 01:35:20,158
World Championship washer.

965
01:35:20,992 --> 01:35:22,950
One day, you'll wash for Australia.

966
01:35:25,033 --> 01:35:27,950
<i>The world was full of
startling new concepts. </i></i>

967
01:35:30,575 --> 01:35:34,617
<i>I couldn't think.
I couldn't breathe. </i></i>

968
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:37,783
<i>I was waiting for her
to come back. </i></i>

969
01:35:38,783 --> 01:35:40,867
<i>Because she was everything. </i></i>

970
01:35:42,867 --> 01:35:44,950
<i>She was everything to me. </i></i>

971
01:35:48,617 --> 01:35:50,700
Hey Dan, you have a visitor.

972
01:35:51,117 --> 01:35:53,200
Visit.

973
01:36:05,283 --> 01:36:07,367
Just Tell her I'm not here.

974
01:36:07,367 --> 01:36:08,700
Are you crazy?

975
01:36:08,783 --> 01:36:10,867
Tell her I knocked off.

976
01:36:14,867 --> 01:36:17,450
Your friend is right here,
just come.

977
01:36:28,617 --> 01:36:30,700
- G'day.
- Hey!

978
01:36:38,783 --> 01:36:40,867
I thought it was tomorrow.

979
01:36:42,783 --> 01:36:44,867
I couldn't wait.

980
01:36:46,283 --> 01:36:47,783
Is that okay?

981
01:36:48,283 --> 01:36:50,367
Yeah! No, it's good!

982
01:36:54,533 --> 01:36:56,617
It's just!
You look so beautiful.

983
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:00,283
It's all that country air.

984
01:37:02,033 --> 01:37:04,117
So I finish in an hour.

985
01:38:16,283 --> 01:38:18,367
Dan.

986
01:38:20,867 --> 01:38:22,950
Dan. Hey!
Hey!

987
01:38:31,408 --> 01:38:35,700
Danny, Danny! Hey!

988
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:39,617
It's Okay.
Hey!

989
01:38:39,617 --> 01:38:42,242
Hey, It's Okay,
I'm here now.

990
01:38:56,950 --> 01:38:59,533
There's no going back.

991
01:39:07,533 --> 01:39:10,450
If you're given a repreive...

992
01:39:11,450 --> 01:39:16,158
I think it is good to remember...

993
01:39:16,158 --> 01:39:22,950
...just how thin it is.
