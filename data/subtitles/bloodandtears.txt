2
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,940
The triple-nine call
was logged at 9.40.

3
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:17,523
Isn't this a bit of a fuss
over a probable suicide?

4
00:01:17,523 --> 00:01:22,225
Her boxer died, now she's dead.
I don't like coincidences.

5
00:01:22,225 --> 00:01:25,746
Recording a nasal temperature
of 32 centigrade.

6
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:33,009
When did it happen?
The man opposite heard something
about 9.30. 9.30 could be right.

7
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,571
OK. I'd like a picture
taken from this angle.

8
00:01:38,571 --> 00:01:42,153
Get all the ammunition.
..Anything else?

9
00:01:42,153 --> 00:01:48,635
Bag the head and hands.
Get her over to the mortuary.
Yep. ..Geoff.

10
00:01:48,635 --> 00:01:54,238
We'll need to recover as much skull
and brain as we can off that wall.

11
00:01:54,238 --> 00:02:00,920
Make sure we get the shot. I'd like
the shot's spread pattern plotted.
Suicide?

12
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,182
I couldn't say without a proper
examination. You mean, you won't.

13
00:02:06,182 --> 00:02:09,424
That's right. ..Ah! Wait, thank you.

14
00:02:16,687 --> 00:02:18,327
What?

15
00:02:18,327 --> 00:02:23,689
If Terence needed his daughter,
why would she kill herself? Despair.

16
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:26,250
It doesn't add up.

17
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:33,733
Suicide's linked to low self-esteem.
How could she lack that if her
father relied on her? It's selfish.

18
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:38,215
Heartless. But not a reason
to rule out suicide.

19
00:02:38,215 --> 00:02:43,137
She isn't selfish OR heartless.
Ask the boys in the gym.

20
00:02:43,137 --> 00:02:47,639
If she didn't kill herself,
somebody killed her.

21
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:50,140
Prove it.

22
00:03:06,046 --> 00:03:11,529
Hello, Mr Reeve. Can you spare us
five minutes afterwards, please?

23
00:03:11,529 --> 00:03:14,010
Lift up the tape, son. Thank you.

24
00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:25,594
Oh, Peter. This is a crime scene.
Police on this side, public on that.

25
00:03:25,594 --> 00:03:30,896
Ex-superintendents go on that side.
I'm here in an official capacity.

26
00:03:30,896 --> 00:03:38,399
As? The Boxing Board has an
interest. When I find something the
Board should know, I'll tell you.

27
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:43,861
How did you know she was dead? Is
she doing your job now? YOU'RE not.

28
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:49,004
Over here, Mr Reeve. So, what's
the Boxing Board's view, Mr Reeve?

29
00:03:49,004 --> 00:03:54,446
It's a tragedy. Terri's been under
pressure since her father's injury.

30
00:03:54,446 --> 00:04:00,808
It would seem she took her own life
as a last desperate response
to this pressure.

31
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:30,104
Just go for it. Yeah...
Absolutely. Morning.

32
00:05:30,104 --> 00:05:34,406
I heard you on the radio.
It was a result.

33
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:40,328
The licence
is as good as in the bag.

34
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,651
MEN TALK IN UNDERTONES, AND LAUGH

35
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:52,233
No, I wouldn't.

36
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:58,135
Where is DC Gladwin? Dunno. I asked
to see Cross's shotgun certificate.

37
00:05:58,135 --> 00:06:01,837
He hasn't got one. Really?
He never had one.

38
00:06:01,837 --> 00:06:08,059
Did SHE? No. That's interesting.
So it might not be their gun.

39
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:12,601
I made a few enquiries.
It's a Wilkes. Handmade.

40
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:19,164
How do you know?
I asked Perks, the gun dealer.
I'd rather you asked me first.

41
00:06:19,164 --> 00:06:22,085
What? How's that?

42
00:06:22,085 --> 00:06:25,806
We should stick
to police firearms experts.

43
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:41,432
So what did Mr Perks say?

44
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:45,034
What do you reckon it's worth?
Dunno.

45
00:06:46,855 --> 00:06:49,316
How about 15,000 quid?

46
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:56,118
Normally we can't trace shotguns.
But one worth 15 grand...

47
00:07:15,586 --> 00:07:20,468
This is the contract
for the sale of your mother's house.

48
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:25,470
If you just sign here...

49
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,091
and here.

50
00:07:28,091 --> 00:07:31,633
How much will be left
from the sale?

51
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:38,615
About Ã£20,000, after fees and taxes.
I'll divide the proceeds
and send you a cheque each.

52
00:07:38,615 --> 00:07:41,636
There's no need. Just send it to Sam.

53
00:07:41,636 --> 00:07:44,858
As you wish. Why?

54
00:07:44,858 --> 00:07:51,901
My sister paid all my mother's care
expenses. Nothing but the best.
It cost a lot more than ten thousand.

55
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:54,942
You'll have to put that
in a letter.

56
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:59,844
Well, let's do it now. Just lend me
your pen again, will you?

57
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,427
HORN BEEPS

58
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:22,013
You frightened me! Sorry. I thought
it was you. You know about Terri?

59
00:08:22,013 --> 00:08:23,913
What can I say?

60
00:08:24,994 --> 00:08:31,436
I feel useless. I don't know
how to help. Be a success.
That's all they wanted.

61
00:08:31,436 --> 00:08:39,079
The gym's nothing without a prospect.
That's YOU. Well, you can rely on me,
Mr Jones. I'm not going nowhere.

62
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:42,681
Good. Good... Hey...

63
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:44,642
head up.

64
00:08:48,303 --> 00:08:55,566
I wish you hadn't done that. What?
The money. Oh, that. What's money?
I won't take it. You need it.

65
00:08:55,566 --> 00:09:03,169
What are you living on? The dole.
No Attendance Allowance, or Child
Benefit since Ricky left school...

66
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:09,792
I manage. I'm after a little job
and I've seen a little flat,
easier to manage.

67
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:14,874
What sort of job? How do I know?
I haven't actually found it yet.

68
00:09:14,874 --> 00:09:21,136
Look, you have to take
that money, Sam. Have my half
and buy a little flat.

69
00:09:21,136 --> 00:09:29,600
"Hello, Mr Bank Manager, I'm forty,
on the dole, I've got Ã£20,000 and
I'd like a mortgage." No, take it.

70
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,042
It makes sense. I haven't finished
with this. I have. Want a lift?

71
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:39,784
No, thanks. I have to go
to the Post Office. It's giro day.

72
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,051
Mr Cross.

73
00:10:00,072 --> 00:10:02,553
Mr Cross, can you hear me?

74
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:07,195
I want to ask you about last night.

75
00:10:07,195 --> 00:10:11,236
Do you remember anything
from last night?

76
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:15,338
Do you remember the gunshot?

77
00:10:16,558 --> 00:10:18,479
Mr Cross...

78
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:22,561
could you give me some sign
that you can hear me?

79
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:30,184
He can't. I know he can't. Detective
Inspector Selway. You are...?

80
00:10:30,184 --> 00:10:33,045
Keith Jones. Friend of the family.

81
00:10:36,346 --> 00:10:39,247
How well did you know the family?

82
00:10:40,508 --> 00:10:43,289
VERY well. Work and personal, both.

83
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,951
Young Theresa's a great loss.

84
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:49,412
Did you know they owned a shotgun?

85
00:10:50,532 --> 00:10:53,573
I gave it to them. When?

86
00:10:53,573 --> 00:11:00,216
It was a year ago.
It was a business gift,
to cement our working relationship.

87
00:11:00,216 --> 00:11:04,017
That's a big gift.
I'm told it's worth 15,000.

88
00:11:04,017 --> 00:11:09,740
It was an important relationship.
I'm a promotor, Terence is a trainer.

89
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,821
Was.
They had no shotgun certificate.

90
00:11:12,821 --> 00:11:16,682
I leave that to you.
I just gave them a present.

91
00:11:16,682 --> 00:11:20,424
But you DO have a certificate?
Yes, of course.

92
00:11:20,424 --> 00:11:24,165
Shooting...
It's a good way to entertain people.

93
00:11:24,165 --> 00:11:30,088
We'll need a statement. Come to
the station today or tomorrow. OK.

94
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:41,632
Rigor is established
in all major muscle groups.

95
00:11:41,752 --> 00:11:48,975
Hypostasis in the back of the body,
further marked in the lower back,
buttocks and lower thighs.

96
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:53,757
This is Dr Stewart. He has
an interest in brain injuries.

97
00:11:53,757 --> 00:12:00,780
If you pull the ragged edges
of the wound back together,
you can see where the impact was.

98
00:12:05,402 --> 00:12:08,403
The injury to the head is massive

99
00:12:08,403 --> 00:12:11,985
and ragged
and appears to have been caused...

100
00:12:11,985 --> 00:12:18,347
by gunshot entering the face
at about the level of the lower lip.

101
00:12:18,347 --> 00:12:22,149
There are no contact marks
on the skin,

102
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:27,111
indicating that the weapon
was not pressed against the flesh.

103
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:30,772
The entry wound is about...
Thanks, Fred.

104
00:12:30,772 --> 00:12:33,753
..ten centimetres across.

105
00:12:35,094 --> 00:12:37,795
Part of the head has been destroyed.

106
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:43,037
There's a quantity of shot
inside the skull.

107
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:52,101
I can't find any wadding.
What's wadding?

108
00:12:52,101 --> 00:13:00,244
Shotgun cartridges have a cap
to stop the lead shot falling out
before the cartridge is fired.

109
00:13:00,244 --> 00:13:05,786
Nowadays it's plastic. You find it
where the gun has been fired,

110
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:12,089
or in the wound. We picked up
everything at the scene. OK. Thanks.

111
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,451
CHILDREN CHEERING

112
00:13:23,973 --> 00:13:26,454
Hey! That's my car!

113
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:32,097
HEY...!
Not any more it isn't.

114
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:38,899
I don't believe this.

115
00:13:46,002 --> 00:13:53,365
Cause of death? Massive trauma
to the brain caused by a shotgun.
Not definitely self-inflicted.

116
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:58,247
Well, I think it WASN'T,
but I've no proof. I'll tell
Superintendent Ross.

117
00:13:58,247 --> 00:14:05,130
When can we expect a report?
I need to see a ballistics expert.
Anything else outstanding?

118
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:12,613
Finding that wadding. The SOCOs
are back at the cottage now, but
I doubt they'll find anything new.

119
00:14:12,613 --> 00:14:14,113
OK.

120
00:14:15,574 --> 00:14:22,317
Is there a problem? No, no...
I worked for Peter Ross
for some time in London.

121
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:26,778
Yeah, he said.
You must know him very well.

122
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:30,000
He is... He's very thorough.

123
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,922
I know. And he has great respect
for your profession.

124
00:14:34,922 --> 00:14:39,664
Is this something you've discussed?
We don't need to.

125
00:14:39,664 --> 00:14:48,127
But...? We're going to need
something concrete soon to continue
pursuing this as a suspicious death.

126
00:14:48,127 --> 00:14:50,728
I know that too.

127
00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:01,152
See? It's all in the block.
It's quite scientific.
Amazing. Do it again.

128
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:07,815
OHH!
Sorry!

129
00:15:07,815 --> 00:15:11,296
Speedy.
Sorry...!

130
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:26,902
It's all yours. Huh... Why?
Well, we can't have you going
in raggedy-arsed cars, Charlie.

131
00:15:26,902 --> 00:15:29,543
This is my promise.

132
00:15:29,543 --> 00:15:36,646
I will do at least as well for you
as Terri could have. Better.
That's the least I can do for her.

133
00:15:36,646 --> 00:15:41,088
What will I do for YOU?
Me...? Nothing.

134
00:15:41,088 --> 00:15:46,230
For Terri, for her dad, you can be
a success. Be a success for us.

135
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:53,553
So you're taking over? We'll
get someone to hold the trainer's
licence. But you're gonna be my star.

136
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,974
Er... "We"? The Board.

137
00:15:57,675 --> 00:16:04,638
I can't have this. It's not right.
I only earned Ã£11,000 last year.
The car is a gift.

138
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:12,261
This is your breakthrough year,
Charlie. There's a TV deal
on the table. The sky's the limit.

139
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:16,562
The car's only the start of it.
You sign with me.

140
00:16:16,562 --> 00:16:23,805
Who's gonna train me? We're getting
someone in. You know him. Who?
Tony Kennedy. Tony K...?

141
00:16:23,805 --> 00:16:31,428
Terence wouldn't have him! They had
harsh words. We're putting all that
behind us. Tony's a good trainer.

142
00:16:31,428 --> 00:16:36,410
So I get to keep the car
if I sign with you and Tony? Yes.

143
00:16:38,571 --> 00:16:46,174
What about Terence? We've organised
accommodation for him. He'll be well
cared for. This is the right thing.

144
00:17:08,383 --> 00:17:10,384
Enjoy!

145
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:32,613
There really is no evidence of
anyone else being involved. She's
right. But you don't believe it?

146
00:17:32,613 --> 00:17:37,295
You aren't identifying with Terri?
Helpless parent...

147
00:17:37,295 --> 00:17:44,197
Of course I am. You and Wyn
did everything you could for
your mother. That's just my point.

148
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:46,898
And Selway's message?

149
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:54,181
Ross doesn't agree that a dedicated
carer is unlikely to commit suicide.
He's entitled to disagree.

150
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:58,943
It's not just that. I'll let him
down, it'll go to court...

151
00:17:58,943 --> 00:18:03,465
His promotions will go on hold...
This has to change.

152
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:08,027
I tried the dinner and black frock.
It wasn't really me.

153
00:18:08,027 --> 00:18:13,289
OK. How DO you want to approach it?
I don't.

154
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:20,432
He's a policeman with his job to do.
I'm a scientist with mine. Right.
So, first scientific question?

155
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:25,894
Where's the wadding
from that shotgun cartridge?

156
00:18:25,894 --> 00:18:28,575
I need to see a firearms expert.

157
00:18:31,756 --> 00:18:35,878
Will Rider.
Retired Royal Army Ordnance Corps.

158
00:18:35,878 --> 00:18:40,020
Lives in Cambridge.
Is he available now?

159
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,981
He owes me a favour or two.

160
00:19:38,063 --> 00:19:41,464
KNOCK AT DOOR
It's open.

161
00:19:47,306 --> 00:19:51,368
Dr Ryan? Captain Rider?
Thanks for coming.

162
00:20:32,304 --> 00:20:35,086
It's very good. Very good.

163
00:20:35,086 --> 00:20:40,608
You should have been a detective.
I am, in a way. Of course.

164
00:20:40,608 --> 00:20:45,230
I can see two problems.
One is, how did she fire the gun?

165
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:52,272
Presumably she tied the string
around the chairback
and pulled the trigger. Possible...

166
00:20:52,272 --> 00:20:59,295
But the firing mechanism
is very positive. If she pulled hard,
she risked spoiling the aim.

167
00:20:59,295 --> 00:21:02,657
Is that conclusive?
Unfortunately, no.

168
00:21:02,657 --> 00:21:06,418
Just likely.
I need something physical.

169
00:21:06,418 --> 00:21:11,100
Tangible.
What was the bore of the gun?

170
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,701
Twelve gauge...I'm told.
I'm no expert.

171
00:21:14,701 --> 00:21:19,503
And the area marked in red
represents the damage.

172
00:21:19,503 --> 00:21:24,845
Roughly the right angle on the head.
I'm bothered by the stuff down there.

173
00:21:24,926 --> 00:21:27,587
What does it mean? I don't know.

174
00:21:32,188 --> 00:21:38,251
There's an awful lot of damage.
What does that mean? I don't know.

175
00:21:38,251 --> 00:21:41,592
What sort of shot was it? Um...

176
00:21:43,253 --> 00:21:45,874
I got that out of her skull.

177
00:21:46,854 --> 00:21:48,935
Buckshot!

178
00:21:48,935 --> 00:21:56,678
Why would people use buckshot
around here? I don't know. It's for
shooting big animals. Deer. Bucks.

179
00:21:56,678 --> 00:22:01,900
Hence the damage to her skull.
Not necessarily. Where is this shot?

180
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,262
At the forensic lab.
How much was there? Um...

181
00:22:09,003 --> 00:22:14,045
There. And there's the the stuff
the SOCOs got out of the wall.

182
00:22:14,045 --> 00:22:18,667
How much is that?
About an ounce and a half.

183
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:24,669
There's your answer! That's miles
too much shot for one cartridge!

184
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:28,091
There was more than one shot!

185
00:22:28,091 --> 00:22:35,274
That's why the spread pattern
is a little bit wrong. That's why
there's so much damage to her head.

186
00:22:35,274 --> 00:22:40,276
Ballistics will say the gun
was fired twice down the same barrel.

187
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:44,777
He backed her into the room
with a shotgun...

188
00:22:44,777 --> 00:22:47,619
He sat her down...

189
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,421
Then pulled the trigger. PCHOO!

190
00:22:54,681 --> 00:23:00,524
Then he thinks about it. He's
intelligent and he knows about guns.

191
00:23:00,524 --> 00:23:04,525
He puts himself
in the mind of the police.

192
00:23:04,525 --> 00:23:09,587
Nobody commits suicide with a gun
held at right angles to their head!

193
00:23:09,587 --> 00:23:15,630
If he leaves things as they are,
the stupidest detective
will know it's murder. What to do?

194
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:22,793
Your murderer
sets up a sophisticated suicide.
He brings over a chair...

195
00:23:22,793 --> 00:23:30,716
He ties the gun to it, attaches
a string to look like the victim has
fired it, lines it up carefully...

196
00:23:30,716 --> 00:23:33,657
pulls the trigger...

197
00:23:33,657 --> 00:23:38,719
Presto! The scene is obliterated.
Or almost.

198
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:41,320
What about the cartridge wadding?

199
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,281
Why didn't I find any in the wound?

200
00:23:44,281 --> 00:23:51,484
You wouldn't with buckshot.
It's big and powerful enough
to blow the wadding to smithereens.

201
00:23:51,484 --> 00:23:58,827
It's very clever. The only thing
your gunman failed to account for
was the extra shot.

202
00:24:00,534 --> 00:24:05,476
Where did you acquire the gun?
I told you. A country-house sale.

203
00:24:05,476 --> 00:24:10,938
Where? Herefordshire.
There's the auctioneer's receipt.

204
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:17,180
Ã£14,700.

205
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:23,523
Guineas. It's a great deal of money
for a gun. It's a very good gun.

206
00:24:23,523 --> 00:24:27,324
Anything else?
Yes, Mr Jones. Such as?

207
00:24:27,324 --> 00:24:33,147
You gave the gun to Terence Cross.
When? 12 months ago. On a shoot.

208
00:24:33,147 --> 00:24:37,929
Were you aware of whether he held
a shotgun certificate? No.

209
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:43,051
Did you try to find out?
We talked about this yesterday.

210
00:24:43,051 --> 00:24:48,013
If you're going to charge me with
anything, shouldn't you caution me?

211
00:24:48,013 --> 00:24:54,175
This is a general talk.
But you're taking a statement.
To establish the facts.

212
00:24:54,175 --> 00:25:00,057
Nevertheless, I would like my lawyer
present if we're going to continue.

213
00:25:00,057 --> 00:25:02,598
As you wish.

214
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:10,081
15,000 guineas is a lot of gun.
Yes.
It's a huge gift.

215
00:25:10,081 --> 00:25:13,743
That's business.
It's the way it works.

216
00:25:13,743 --> 00:25:18,005
You must have had something in mind
for a return.

217
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:22,707
Must I?
Yes.

218
00:25:22,707 --> 00:25:29,849
- What did Terence Cross have that
was worth a fifteen grand bauble?
- Well... Nothing.

219
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:34,051
It's much vaguer than that.
It's more "feelgood".

220
00:25:34,051 --> 00:25:41,294
Did you hear that, Inspector?
How much feelgood would 15 grand
buy in this nick? Loads.

221
00:25:41,294 --> 00:25:44,935
Are you going to charge me
over this gun?

222
00:25:44,935 --> 00:25:51,558
- Stuff the gun.
Cross had something you wanted!
- I don't think I like your tone.

223
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:54,239
I don't care if you like my tone!

224
00:25:54,239 --> 00:26:02,022
- Someone is dead because of this
gun and I'm asking you about it!
- Am I under arrest?

225

KNOCKING

226
00:26:15,388 --> 00:26:19,709
Sorry. Dr Ryan's outside.
Oh. Bring her in.

227
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:29,573
Cross had a stable of fighters,
several championship prospects. They
must glitter like jewels to Jones.

228
00:26:29,573 --> 00:26:34,035
So, you don't think Kevin Sharma
was murdered? No.

229
00:26:34,035 --> 00:26:39,297
They needed him alive and kicking.
Punching? Quite. Alive and punching.

230
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:46,560
Terri Cross was murdered.
Two shots were fired into her head,
the one to cover the other wound.

231
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:51,582
It's very rare to shoot yourself
in the head twice. True.

232
00:26:51,582 --> 00:26:56,424
No defence marks on her body.
She let the murderer come in.

233
00:26:56,424 --> 00:26:58,905
She knew and trusted him. Jones?

234
00:26:58,905 --> 00:27:02,126
He's a cool one if it was. Then...?

235
00:27:02,126 --> 00:27:09,689
Reeve and Jones. They're like that,
yeah? Get Reeve in here.
Ask him? Arrest him? Tell him!

236
00:27:09,689 --> 00:27:16,192
He hangs around here
like Banquo's bloody ghost,
burbling about when he ran CID...

237
00:27:16,192 --> 00:27:19,113
He can tell us about his mate Jones.

238
00:27:19,113 --> 00:27:21,654
..Thanks, Sam.

239
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:49,125
I'm sorry. It's time.

240
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:01,270
DOORBELL BUZZES

241
00:28:04,771 --> 00:28:06,532
Wyn!

242
00:28:14,455 --> 00:28:16,256
Wyn?

243
00:28:20,878 --> 00:28:24,639
Did you not hear me
at the front door?

244
00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:29,721
I didn't know it was you. I didn't
want to answer the door like this.

245
00:28:29,721 --> 00:28:32,262
What happened?

246
00:28:32,262 --> 00:28:34,823
Is it Mammy's clothes?

247
00:28:35,864 --> 00:28:38,445
It had to be dealt with.

248
00:28:38,445 --> 00:28:45,207
I just thought,
"I'll have a tidy up and that'll be
that. It's just a practical matter."

249
00:28:45,207 --> 00:28:48,089
Of course it's not "just practical".

250
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:56,072
I'm so useless, bawling like this.
I've the rest of the house to do
before I go. How will I manage?

251
00:28:56,072 --> 00:28:58,993
Don't manage. What do you mean?

252
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:02,995
I'm all alone in that new place.

253
00:29:04,775 --> 00:29:10,418
Why don't you come and stay with me
until you get yourself straight? No.

254
00:29:10,418 --> 00:29:13,799
You'd be doing me a favour. No.

255
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:20,301
How would I? I'm not going soft.
I was sortin' out Mammy's stuff
and got upset.

256
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:25,263
I'll be fine. It'd be nice for me
to have someone there sometimes.

257
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:32,987
And not others! It won't work. We'll
fight like cats and dogs. You're the
sort of person that polishes spoons!

258
00:29:32,987 --> 00:29:39,429
How would you cope with me
slumped on your sofa?
You won't be slumped on my sofa!

259
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:42,710
No. Thanks, but no thanks.

260
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:47,132
I'll get a flat of my own
and slump on my own sofa.

261
00:29:49,213 --> 00:29:53,835
How are you going to get that stuff
down to Oxfam?

262
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:56,696
I hadn't figured that out yet.

263
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:05,159
Will I come back later
and give you a hand?

264
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:08,721
EASY-LISTENING MUSIC PLAYS

265
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:31,770
What the frigging...?

266
00:30:38,413 --> 00:30:40,934
What? ..WHAT?

267
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:02,402
Mr Reeve, as a former policeman, you
know the importance of co-operation.
Go on.

268
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:09,245
Who has to gain from Theresa Cross's
death? You think she was murdered?

269
00:31:09,245 --> 00:31:14,467
I KNOW she was. Who would benefit?
Not me, if that's what you think.

270
00:31:14,467 --> 00:31:22,370
You're a pain in the arse! You're in
and out of this nick as if you own
it, but you're not a suspect! Thanks.

271
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:29,273
Could it be Jones? I suppose Jones
COULD benefit from Theresa's death.

272
00:31:29,273 --> 00:31:32,834
Would he do it? It's unlikely. Why?

273
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:40,778
He plays mind games with people.
He's a game player, a businessman.
You wouldn't call him strong.

274
00:31:40,778 --> 00:31:45,780
You don't have to be strong
to pull a trigger.

275
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:16,132
That's twice.
Next time make an appointment.

276
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,355
Do you want a coffee?

277
00:32:28,357 --> 00:32:33,619
Kevin told me he had a fight
on the building site. When?

278
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:36,480
About six weeks before he died.

279
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,482
So, that's where he got
his injuries to his hands? Yes.

280
00:32:41,482 --> 00:32:46,104
And it's where he got
his blood clot on the brain.

281
00:32:47,244 --> 00:32:51,786
Did he have headaches?
Dunno. He wouldn't talk about it.

282
00:32:51,786 --> 00:32:59,009
But you could see the injuries
to him? He was all beat up.
That was why he avoided Terri.

283
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:03,531
He didn't want her
to see his bruises. Is that all?

284
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:09,033
No. ..I imagine he didn't want
to face her, knowing what he knew.

285
00:33:09,033 --> 00:33:12,234
What did he know?

286
00:33:15,215 --> 00:33:20,117
Why did he have a fight
on a building site?

287
00:33:20,117 --> 00:33:22,878
Who did he fight?

288
00:33:22,878 --> 00:33:31,242
Tony Kennedy, an ex-boxer, bit of a
throwback. He thinks you fight with
your chin out and the toughest wins.

289
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:38,325
Jones knows so little about boxing,
he actually hired Kennedy
to be my trainer. KENNEDY!

290
00:33:38,325 --> 00:33:40,866
I mean, the man is an animal.

291
00:33:40,866 --> 00:33:46,268
How? He's a disgrace. When
he couldn't get a boxing licence,

292
00:33:46,268 --> 00:33:50,069
he did bare-knuckles
in the backs of pubs.

293
00:33:50,169 --> 00:33:53,771
Terence wouldn't have him
in the gym!

294
00:33:53,771 --> 00:34:01,274
And Jones had me sign a contract
and gave me a car as a sweetie.
What happened to Terence?

295
00:34:06,736 --> 00:34:13,959
He got put in a wheelchair
by a hit and run. Only,
the hit and run wasn't an accident.

296
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:17,640
Kennedy knocked him down.
How do you know?

297
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,221
I DON'T know!

298
00:34:20,221 --> 00:34:27,084
Kevin told me. He went off to kill
Kennedy! He wanted to rip him apart
with his bare hands!

299
00:34:27,084 --> 00:34:31,786
He fought Kennedy bare-knuckle?
In a skip.

300
00:34:31,786 --> 00:34:38,689
So, Jones had Kennedy
try to kill Terence Cross
for control of his boxers.

301
00:34:38,689 --> 00:34:44,271
When Kevin found out what Kennedy
did, he tried to settle it with him.

302
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:49,453
Who killed Theresa?

303
00:34:51,994 --> 00:34:54,615
I told her.

304
00:34:54,615 --> 00:34:58,557
Dr Ryan, I told her...all I know.

305
00:35:00,237 --> 00:35:05,599
I told her that Kennedy drove
the van that ran down her dad.

306
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,221
What did she say?

307
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:12,642
I should have...

308
00:35:12,642 --> 00:35:15,543
I should have looked after her.

309
00:35:19,085 --> 00:35:21,046
I-I...

00:35:35,391 --> 00:35:38,493
KNOCK AT DOOR
Yeah.

312
00:35:38,493 --> 00:35:42,474
Sir, could you...?
Yeah, sure.

313
00:35:45,716 --> 00:35:48,417
What was all that about, then?

314
00:35:55,279 --> 00:36:02,262
DOOR OPENS
Do you have an address
for someone called Anthony Kennedy?

315
00:36:02,262 --> 00:36:07,144
Yes. I'd have to go to my records
to get it. Why?

316
00:36:07,144 --> 00:36:11,126
Can you get some big lads and a car?
..Why?

317
00:36:11,126 --> 00:36:13,887
Well, he hasn't won the Lottery!

318
00:36:13,887 --> 00:36:16,628
Did he shoot the girl? Follow!

319
00:36:18,989 --> 00:36:24,611
What IS this?! DS Speed is going to
play snooker with you. For how long?

320
00:36:24,611 --> 00:36:27,832
Till I say different. Tell me why.

321
00:36:27,832 --> 00:36:33,615
I'm off to arrest someone. The few
that know are coming too, except you.

322
00:36:33,615 --> 00:36:41,058
If he runs, you could be accused of
tipping him off. You're arresting me.
I'm offering you a game of snooker.

323
00:36:42,098 --> 00:36:43,799
Billiards.

324
00:36:43,799 --> 00:36:48,441
Heads or tails?
Heads. ..Ha. Chalk?

325
00:36:51,702 --> 00:36:54,683
SIREN WAILS

326
00:36:57,324 --> 00:37:04,707
Charlie, if you get in there
with DI Selway. The boys will be
in the car behind. ..Thanks, Sam.

327
00:37:04,707 --> 00:37:09,509
He wants to do it for Terri.
His evidence only mentions Kevin.

328
00:37:09,509 --> 00:37:13,851
We need something concrete
to take to court on her.

329
00:38:11,074 --> 00:38:18,537
This is the first time I've been
in the back of a police car without
any handcuffs on. How does it feel?

330
00:38:20,557 --> 00:38:22,338
Naked.

331
00:39:30,005 --> 00:39:32,486
Who's this?

332
00:39:33,807 --> 00:39:36,328
That's him. That's him.

333
00:39:51,414 --> 00:39:54,895
SIRENS WAIL

334
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:02,738
Shit!

335
00:40:15,203 --> 00:40:21,946
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence if
you omit something you use in court.

336
00:40:52,778 --> 00:40:57,460
So, Tony, you're in a bit of a jam.
Murder.

337
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:02,242
I killed no-one. Kevin Sharma died
of injuries he got fighting you.

338
00:41:02,242 --> 00:41:06,484
Double jam.
Double? You know why he fought you.

339
00:41:06,484 --> 00:41:09,065
You ran down Terence Cross.

340
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:12,926
I want a brief to be present.
Good idea.

341
00:41:12,926 --> 00:41:18,468
Yeah, keep mum till the brief turns
up. Do you think he killed Theresa?

342
00:41:18,468 --> 00:41:21,330
I never.
Yeah.
I never!

343
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:27,192
He's never coming out. They're all
eligible after 15 years for parole.

344
00:41:27,192 --> 00:41:34,795
It depends on the Home Secretary.
Which way do YOU vote, Tony?
No, they're all tough on crime now.

345
00:41:34,795 --> 00:41:42,298
You're nicked for murder
and attempted murder! You'll be in
prison well into the next century.

346
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:51,041
Look, the old man was an accident.
He stumbled in front of the van.
I only meant to frighten him.

347
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:57,584
Kevin was pickin' a fight.
I was only defending meself.
How's that murder?

348
00:41:57,584 --> 00:42:03,326
When you get that lawyer, get him
to explain the law on murder to you,

349
00:42:03,326 --> 00:42:07,928
cos if he gets that down to
manslaughter, he's your best friend!

350
00:42:07,928 --> 00:42:11,370
Except, YOU could be.

351
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:13,911
Me? How?

352
00:42:13,911 --> 00:42:19,353
Keith Jones shot
Theresa Cross, didn't he?
I don't know.

353
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:24,835
I don't know.

354
00:42:24,835 --> 00:42:27,776
KNOCK ON DOOR

355
00:42:27,776 --> 00:42:30,357
Oh, Trevor. Come in.

356
00:42:30,357 --> 00:42:33,859
Sam asked me to give you a hand.
She's busy.

357
00:42:33,859 --> 00:42:37,320
Where have I heard that before?
Sorry.

358
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,602
It's not YOUR fault.
All this to go?

359
00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:44,243
I hear you've got a new flat.

360
00:42:45,723 --> 00:42:49,165
What's it like?
Small.

361
00:42:50,685 --> 00:42:55,387
Sam said she'd asked you
to move in with her for a bit.

362
00:42:55,387 --> 00:42:57,908
She did, yeah.

363
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,669
Do you think you will?

364
00:43:06,972 --> 00:43:11,394
Guv, Jones is here with a brief.
What, for him?

365
00:43:11,394 --> 00:43:16,376
He hasn't said. They want to see you,
and Dr Ryan's on the phone, too.

366
00:43:16,376 --> 00:43:19,977
Ask DI Selway to see Jones, yeah?
Yeah.

367
00:43:19,977 --> 00:43:23,659
OFFICER:
Right, you, sit down and shut up!

368
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:30,581
Sam? 'Get your man?' You make
me sound like a Mountie. We did.

369
00:43:30,581 --> 00:43:35,943
I think I can prove who murdered
Terri. I examined her body again.

370
00:43:35,943 --> 00:43:41,486
On her arm I found a hair pulled
out by the root, like in a struggle.

371
00:43:41,486 --> 00:43:44,687
So? 'It's not Terri's.

372
00:43:44,687 --> 00:43:47,948
'My bet is it's Jones's.' Mine, too.

373
00:43:47,948 --> 00:43:53,030
If you can get a sample of Jones's
hair, a DNA test will confirm it.

374
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:57,892
Superintendent Ross,
this is my lawyer, Joe Feeney.

375
00:43:57,892 --> 00:44:03,715
Hello. Hello.
Mr Jones thinks we're accusing him.
We didn't call you.

376
00:44:03,715 --> 00:44:09,357
I came here to confront this farrago.
Charlie vandalised my home today!

377
00:44:09,357 --> 00:44:13,739
- Is that a complaint?
- Yes, official!

378
00:44:13,739 --> 00:44:20,321
- I'm here to face my accusers.
I don't run scared!
- Answer me one question.

379
00:44:20,321 --> 00:44:24,563
- Any!
- Can we have a sample of your hair?

380
00:44:31,606 --> 00:44:34,167
Hello, Sam. Hello.

381
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:39,009
Did you get the hair sample?
Yeah, well, he could hardly refuse.

382
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:44,731
The one I got from Terri's body's
in the fridge. I'll get it tomorrow.

383
00:44:44,731 --> 00:44:51,554
Did you arrest Jones? Yeah, but
his lawyer reckons we've nothing.
You don't agree?

384
00:44:51,554 --> 00:44:59,757
On its own, he might be right,
but he knew about the gun, he stood
to gain from her death. The gym?

385
00:44:59,757 --> 00:45:06,460
Exactly. That's a powerful reason
to murder her.
Let's hope the jury thinks so.

386
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:12,902
Fancy another go at dinner? I know
somewhere that stays opens late.

387
00:45:14,103 --> 00:45:17,904
Well, I'll need to go home
and change.

388
00:45:17,904 --> 00:45:20,745
I'll come with you.

389
00:45:35,071 --> 00:45:39,933
You have a drink
while I get changed, and I'll drive.

390
00:45:39,933 --> 00:45:44,495
Why don't we both have a drink
and call a cab?

391
00:45:46,716 --> 00:45:49,717
FOOD SIZZLES

392
00:45:51,938 --> 00:45:56,219
Sam? Sam, is that you?
You came, then.

393
00:45:56,219 --> 00:46:02,422
Yes. Trevor brought me. Very nice.
I've cooked supper for us.

394
00:46:02,422 --> 00:46:06,764
Smells good. Wyn, this is
Superintendent Peter Ross. Wyn.

395
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:12,626
Hello, Peter. I'm sure we can
make it stretch round four. Four?

396
00:46:12,626 --> 00:46:14,767
