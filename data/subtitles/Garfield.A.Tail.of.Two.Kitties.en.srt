1
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:54,655
Once upon a time,
in an English castle far, far away,

2
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,491
there lived a pampered personage

3
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,452
by the name of Prince.

4
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:06,083
- All right, everyone, he's awake.
- Hurry.

5
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:10,254
Quickly. Get the Carlyle log.

6
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:22,391
Prince knew no other life
than a life of luxury.

7
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,727
Did I mention that Prince was a cat?

8
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,317
Good morning, Prince.

9
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,988
Your tea.

10
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,240
Brekkie.

11
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,909
I have your favorite dish.

12
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,411
Carlyle log.

13
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,455
Lovely.

14
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,551
Super.

15
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,726
It's good to be the king.

16
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:11,815
On the other side of the world,
there lived an equally pampered cat

17
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,151
who thought he was the king,

18
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:17,487
but who ruled over
a somewhat smaller domain.

19
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,198
Meow.

20
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,203
I'm the king of the cul-de-sac.

21
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,538
That's what I'm talking about.

22
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:30,876
Jon and I have everything
I could ever want.

23
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,254
Food in the fridge. Cable and satellite.

24
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,506
And don't forget lasagna.

25
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,968
That's right. It's good to be king.

26
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:47,309
I want you to know
you're the most important thing in my life.

27
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,061
Let me sleep, please.

28
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:52,147
Before I met you, my life had no meaning.

29
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,024
I was incomplete.

30
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,193
You still are, really.

31
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:01,949
I guess what I'm trying to say is...
will you marry me?

32
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,201
Marriage.

33
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:08,914
Well, this is kind of sudden.
There may be some legal issues here.

34
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,124
Look, I like you, but not as a spouse.

35
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,628
Maybe as a servant we could
stay together, make it work.

36
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,047
So what do you say, Liz?

37
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,591
Wait a second. Liz?

38
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,718
Garfield.

39
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,889
Liz is a girl. No, worse - she's a girl vet.

40
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:30,560
- Turkey's ready.
- I think Jon has touched bottom now.

41
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,442
We gotta put an end to this torture.

42
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,945
Time for a new DJ.

43
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,285
Cat scratch fever!

44
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,787
Oh, cat scratch fever!

45
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,624
Somebody take my temperature.

46
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,001
Garfield.

47
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,758
- Man, you have changed.
- I can't have you messing this up for me.

48
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:06,555
I get it. It's her.
She doesn't like our music.

49
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:11,059
Whatever happened to Jon,
my metalhead guy, my dude?

50
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,645
You were so much cooler
when you wore a mullet.

51
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,813
Now stay here.

52
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,357
Far cooler. I suppose she likes this haircut?

53
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,487
- Coming.
- Tell me she likes it the way it is now.

54
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:30,287
- Hey, Liz.
- Jon, I have incredible news.

55
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:34,750
Guess who's speaking at the fundraiser
for the Royal Animal Conservancy.

56
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,044
- Siegfried and Roy?
- Come on.

57
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,629
- Just Siegfried?
- Jane Goodall dropped out

58
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,549
'cause she's nursing a sick chimp,
and they asked me.

59
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:46,845
It's gonna be at this really cool castle
on a huge estate.

60
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:52,351
I am flying to London tomorrow morning.
Can you believe this? I have to pack.

61
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,187
Are these rose petals and candles?

62
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,815
Yeah, well, I have... I've some...

63
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,777
Some important news of my own.

64
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,198
Me too.

65
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,995
Excuse me.
Do you believe in love at first sight?

66
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,793
I was hoping you'd say yes.
You have made me so very cat happy.

67
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:23,340
- Come on. What's the news?
- The news is, I...

68
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,094
I finally house-trained Odie.

69
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,387
- Really?
- Yeah.

70
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,972
That would explain the rose petals.

71
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:41,691
I have to pack. I'm so sorry about dinner,
but I will send your regards to the Queen.

72
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:45,487
- Congratulations on Odie.
- Yeah. And you too.

73
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,656
They're lucky to have you.

74
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,449
Bye.

75
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,916
- I thought she'd never leave.
- Garfield. You ate the whole turkey?

76
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,044
- Well, yeah.
- What are you doing with this?

77
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,089
Never mind.

78
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,467
It's too late. She's already off to...

79
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,011
Good stuffing.

80
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,265
Come on. Cheer up.
I saved you the wishbone.

81
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:17,227
- There's nothing I can do.
- Return the ring. Get your money back.

82
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:21,481
- Wait a minute. I'll go to London.
- You poor sap.

83
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,609
- She'll love it. She'll be surprised.
- Tell me you won't.

84
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,112
- She'll say yes.
- Please don't.

85
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,364
- I gotta go pack.
- You moron.

86
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,369
This is a huge mistake, Jon.
One of your biggest.

87
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:39,207
Don't roam. Stay home. Odie and I
are not just coming along for the ride, pal.

88
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,087
This is actually an intervention.

89
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,259
Okay, guys. Here we are.

90
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,721
Quick flight.
We must have been in the jet stream.

91
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:59,227
England is no great shakes. The buildings
here look like the kennel back home.

92
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,565
That is the kennel back home.
They'll never take me alive.

93
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,569
- They're gonna be fine, Jon.
- Yeah.

94
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,323
Garfield's never stayed in a kennel before.

95
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,825
I'm afraid he might have
some separation anxiety.

96
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,038
No. He's probably fast asleep
in his cage by now.

97
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,625
You hear me, Warden?
I have the right to remain silent.

98
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,587
Anything I say can and will
be held against me in a court of law.

99
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,964
And I have the right
to an attorney too, pal.

100
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:32,219
And if I can't afford one,
one must be provided for me by the court.

101
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,973
Never mind. I just broke out.

102
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,518
He likes a belly rub twice a day.

103
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:43,772
If you could give him lasagna
between each meal, that would be great.

104
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,441
Almost forgot Pookie.
He can't be without Pookie.

105
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,499
Great. Just when things were looking up.

106
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,584
Why don't you stay
and get your fleas removed?

107
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,920
Maybe get a brain transplant.

108
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,882
Go away. Beat it. Hide beneath the wheels.

109
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,802
You're ripping my fur. Get off.

110
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:14,886
Get in here. Get in.

111
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,139
You have my cell phone and hotel number?

112
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,183
- Bye, now.
- Okay.

113
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,853
Airport, and step on it.

114
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:29,317
Jon won't mind if I repack him.
We're gonna need some room in this bag.

115
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,939
You savage beast.
How dare you. Get out of here.

116
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,399
Smithee.

117
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,360
There's something in the pool, Smithee.

118
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,409
There's a duck in my pool, Smithee.
A duck.

119
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,869
A duck, sir?

120
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,081
Filthy wild animal
soaking itself in my pool.

121
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:29,586
- What do you intend doing about this?
- I shall speak to the duck, sir.

122
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,966
By the way, the solicitors are here
to read Lady Eleanor's will.

123
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,384
Excellent.

124
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,972
In a few moments,
I'll be the master of this entire estate.

125
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:44,684
And from this day on,
things will be done my way.

126
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:04,913
This is the last will and testament
of Lady Eleanor Carlyle of Carlyle Castle.

127
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,999
"I declare this to be
my last will and testament

128
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,710
"which I make this first day
of September... "

129
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,672
Keep still.
They're reading Lady Eleanor's will.

130
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,924
I've got a bad feeling about this.

131
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,844
If Lord Dargis gets the estate,
we're done for.

132
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,054
Quiet.

133
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:25,266
"To my devoted Smithee:
I make thee caretaker of my estate.

134
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,269
"Care for my beloved animal friends
as you have in the past

135
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:32,107
"and you'll always
have a home at Carlyle Castle. "

136
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,818
Thank you, madam.

137
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:38,363
She's dead, Smithee.
You can stop sucking up.

138
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:42,450
"The rest of my worldly possessions,
my castle and grounds,

139
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,911
"I leave to the love of my life,

140
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,123
"somebody who was like a son to me... "

141
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:53,128
- Thank you, Aunt Eleanor. Thank you.
- Please let me finish, Mr. Dargis.

142
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,755
I'm sorry. I got a little ahead of myself.

143
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,466
"... like a son to me,
I leave all my possessions

144
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,344
"to my beloved kitty, Prince the 12th. "

145
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:05,140
- Incredible. Entirely without precedent.
- This is what it says.

146
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,475
But I'm her nephew, her only heir.

147
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,186
She can't have left it all to her cat.

148
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:14,941
- I, Prince, the new lord of the castle?
- Hurrah.

149
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:18,903
Good show, Lady Eleanor. Bless her heart.

150
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:23,324
- Can it be? We are delivered.
- Thank you, Winston.

151
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:27,245
The will clearly states
that you may stay on at Carlyle Castle

152
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:31,374
and receive your usual stipend
of 50 pounds a week.

153
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,917
50 pounds?

154
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:37,589
Upon Prince's passing, after what
we assume will be a long and happy life,

155
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,759
you will receive the castle,
the land and your title.

156
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:44,387
But that fat ball of fur
could last for another 15 years.

157
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,014
Let us hope so.

158
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:55,315
The castle was built over 600 years ago
by Lord Franklin Carlyle.

159
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,276
Now, the initial structure
is late medieval in style...

160
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,029
On this wing, we'll put the pool and spa.

161
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,865
Yes, and where would
the squash courts be?

162
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,159
- There he is.
- That's unbelievable.

163
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:10,997
Hello. Snap your photos. Unfortunately,
I can but spare a few moments...

164
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:15,376
Buddy, do you mind stepping aside?
I can't get a good shot of the cat.

165
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:19,923
Greetings, all. Hello. So glad.

166
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,425
May I remind you this is private property.

167
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,386
Relax, bro. It's not like you own the place.

168
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,222
We shall see.

169
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:35,647
To all the royal subjects, I give you
the new possessor of Carlyle Castle,

170
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,148
Prince Xll.

171
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,406
To one and all, I pledge,
from this day forward,

172
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,743
to rule my kingdom
with wisdom and valor.

173
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:53,581
And as long as I reign,
you shall continue to have safe haven

174
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,168
here on the bountiful grounds of Carlyle.

175
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,170
Thank you. That is all.

176
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,049
Hurrah. Long live Prince.

177
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,010
I think that went frightfully well,
don't you, Winny?

178
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,972
Sire, I hasten to remind you
that Lord Dargis

179
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,057
has every reason to get rid of you.

180
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,434
Winny, pooh-pooh.

181
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,104
I'm his favorite kitty cat.

182
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,825
Hello, little Prince.

183
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,828
What a beautiful day for a picnic, what?

184
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:35,206
No, thanks, old boy.
You just run along and enjoy yourself.

185
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,708
What the devil...?

186
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:42,130
So it's hide-and-seek you want to play?
All right, I'll count to 100.

187
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,967
- Hello, Rommel.
- One, two, three, four, five...

188
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:51,306
...35, 36, 37, 38...

189
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,977
...96, 97, 98, 99, 100.

190
00:14:56,061 --> 00:15:00,565
All right. Fair warning.
Ready or not, here I come.

191
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,655
Bon voyage, Prince.

192
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,537
Dear me.
I may have misjudged the old boy.

193
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,331
Perhaps he is somewhat of a scoundrel.

194
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,834
After all, this is not the way
one plays hide-and-seek.

195
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,248
Blimey.

196
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,836
- Will that be all, sir?
- Yes. Thank you.

197
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,798
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

198
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,216
Wait.

199
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:12,095
- How do I look?
- Lovely, sir.

200
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:16,975
No, see, I'm proposing to my girlfriend.
She's staying down the hall.

201
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,851
I want to make sure I look...

202
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,478
Let's see, now.

203
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,399
It needs a certain...

204
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:32,573
May I, sir? There we are. Hugh Grant.

205
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,619
Great. Could you deliver this
to the girl in room 407?

206
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,288
- Of course, sir.
- And...

207
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,126
And this.

208
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,169
Cary Grant, sir.

209
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,140
- Jon.
- Hey.

210
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:00,518
- Why are you here?
- It's Fashion Week. Where else would I be?

211
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,396
This is incredible.
I can't believe you're here.

212
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,647
So you're glad?

213
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,983
Glad? I'm thrilled.

214
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:11,112
But London?
Did you come all the way here just for me?

215
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:16,784
Yeah, it's nuts.
In fact, I want us to be together...

216
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,626
Odie. Come here.

217
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,339
Air. Water. Lasagna.

218
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,259
- Garfield?
- That's the hello I get?

219
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,220
13 hours in a bag with a farting dog.

220
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,348
There are quarantine laws here.

221
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,642
Don't let Odie out of your sight.
They might deport him.

222
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,396
Deport Odie? I like this country already.

223
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:52,570
Okay. I'm gonna need a litter box,
room-service menu and the TV remote -

224
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,363
and in that order.

225
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,450
If anyone needs me, I'll be in my office.

226
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,915
Where are my clothes?

227
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,959
Cool. My very own cat tub.

228
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,175
Golly.

229
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:21,224
Got it. Could have just come down
and told me that.

230
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,601
Listen up. Barnyard newsflash.

231
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,770
I've got some good news
and some bad news.

232
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,606
- Which would you like first?
- The bad news.

233
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,526
Lord Dargis just threw Prince in the river.

234
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:38,032
- Okay, give me the good news.
- He was in a lovely picnic basket.

235
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,702
If he throws us in the river,
we'll never survive.

236
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,413
You're ducks. You can swim.

237
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:48,417
- Winston, I'm next in line for the throne.
- This could get ugly.

238
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:52,922
- I have a list of new rules of governance.
- I hardly think that's necessary.

239
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:57,635
Rule number one. The barnyard animals
congregate entirely too close to the castle.

240
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,595
We house pets need our space.

241
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,224
You've got enough space, laddie -
right between your ears.

242
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,477
Take that back.
I command you, as your new king.

243
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:10,481
There's still a chance
Prince may find his way back here.

244
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,609
In the meantime, Claudius,
you get into the castle

245
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,778
and find out what Dargis is up to.

246
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,573
I'm on it. I'm your mouse on the inside.

247
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,200
I'll see what I can learn from my end.

248
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,374
- I want to do something more cultural.
- Okay.

249
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,917
You're cold.

250
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:34,255
Getting colder.
You're an icicle. You're frozen stiff.

251
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:38,384
Let's remind ourselves
what we're looking for. It's a hamburger.

252
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,596
A squeaky hamburger.

253
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:45,808
- We'll take a walk through Hyde Park.
- Excuse me? We walk?

254
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:50,104
Then we stroll down
the incredibly cultural Piccadilly.

255
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,648
- Stroll?
- And then Carnaby Street.

256
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,193
Aren't we 40 years too late
for Carnaby Street?

257
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,029
No, luv, that's where
all the swinging birds are.

258
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,532
Well, then, we are definitely
going to the British Museum.

259
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,994
Any cuter, I'm gonna need a barf bag.

260
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,373
What are you doing?

261
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,418
I'm security, protecting you from yourself.

262
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,712
You have caused enough trouble today.

263
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:17,340
Now, you have food, water and company.

264
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,425
- Which one is he?
- Be good.

265
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:24,055
Jon, you're delirious.
Be careful. She's a man-eater.

266
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,266
Oh, no. He's under her spell.

267
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:31,062
Okay, Odie, I'll give you one small clue.

268
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,813
It's not in there.

269
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,777
Prince?

270
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,114
Where is that cat?

271
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,243
Prince.

272
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,292
Prince.

273
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,753
Prince.

274
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,298
Prince.

275
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,467
Prince.

276
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,844
Pull.

277
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:14,397
Sir, have you by any chance seen Prince?
I can't seem to find him anywhere.

278
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:19,860
Oh, dear. You mean our little orange
bundle of fun is missing?

279
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,155
Pull.

280
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,495
Crikey. The man's got a cannon.

281
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:33,291
- And he's pointing it at us.
- We're sitting ducks.

282
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,877
Careful, sir. You wouldn't want
to injure the creatures, would you?

283
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,921
Run away.

284
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:42,883
Course not. That would make me
some kind of monster, wouldn't it?

285
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,094
By the way, I've a little errand for you.

286
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:48,472
Could you go to London,
pick up my new suits at Willoughby's?

287
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,141
Very good, sir.

288
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,857
Pull.

289
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,780
Can you imagine taking a nap
on that table?

290
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,701
Just lie there for hours and shed.

291
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,954
The Queen's corgis, Milly and Tillie,

292
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,541
returned from their world cruise
with the Queen aboard her yacht.

293
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,877
The animals suffered mild seasickness,

294
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:21,547
but now are back to eating
the finest calf's liver in the universe.

295
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,341
Must be sweet.

296
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,010
"My tummy's upset.
May I have some liver?"

297
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:29,138
- Boy, I wish Jon was a queen.
- Housekeeping.

298
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:32,308
Okay, blockhead, time to bust out of here
and catch up with Jon.

299
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,684
First, let's grab some chow,

300
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:37,772
before I eat your liver with
some fava beans and a nice Chianti.

301
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,780
Sorry, we left a bit of a mess
in the bathroom. Thanks.

302
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,161
Keep your eyes peeled
for a goofy-looking guy with a map.

303
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,830
They're not up here. I'm coming down.

304
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,504
Jon, Jon, Jon.

305
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,382
Where's Waldo?

306
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:09,804
Take the picture. Take it. Take the picture.

307
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,605
Halt. Right face.

308
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:23,109
Excuse me. Did you see a couple of people
who looked like tourists?

309
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,860
I know this drill.

310
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,780
They won't crack up
no matter what you do.

311
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,658
Hey, freeze-frame, your knee's on fire.

312
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,618
I know I can get this guy.

313
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,246
Seriously, your zipper's down.

314
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,206
Hey, dry goods.

315
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,752
Anybody ever tell you
you look like Tina Turner?

316
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:45,923
- That was effective.
- Her Majesty, the queen of England.

317
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,842
What's all the hubbub?

318
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:49,802
Attention.

319
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,681
Hey, Odie, look. It's those royal corgis.

320
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,352
Hey, lady. You got any leftover liver?

321
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,312
Stuck-up little punk.

322
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,940
I know she heard us.
They had the top down.

323
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,567
Odie?

324
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:08,904
Odie, no, don't do the ugly American thing.

325
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,075
The British are coming.

326
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,911
Well, you made him crack, anyway.

327
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:21,584
Disgusting. It's so smelly down here.
I must get out. Hello.

328
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,880
Can someone help a chap?
I'm in the sewer.

329
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,967
This is hopeless. We'll never find Jon.

330
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:33,220
Face it, Odie,
nobody cares whether we live or...

331
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,564
Prince. I've found you.

332
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:48,110
Oh, dear. Why is it the weird ones
always go for the cat, not the dog?

333
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,070
Odie, help, please.

334
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:56,368
- Is that a cologne or a disinfectant, sir?
- I just got you a special treat. Minced pie.

335
00:24:56,495 --> 00:25:00,122
Odie, call a cop. I mean bobby, orjimmy.

336
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:05,002
Never mind, Odie. Don't bother.
There's a pie here. I'll be just fine.

337
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:39,245
Dear heavens. That was absolutely
the most horrifying. But I'm alive. I'm alive.

338
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:42,665
And covered in filth.

339
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,419
Here, here. I must return to my throne.

340
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,797
What ho?

341
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:55,553
Indeed. Seeing me in this state
must be shocking. I've lost my bearings.

342
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:59,056
You must lead me with all due haste
to the castle at Carlyle.

343
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,433
But first I require a bath.

344
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,729
Here, come on.
Do you expect me to lick myself?

345
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:09,275
Garfield? Odie? What are you doing here?

346
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,278
Garfield? What the devil is a Garfield?

347
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,405
What am I gonna do with you guys?

348
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:17,825
Do you know how bad I would feel
if I lost you here?

349
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:21,912
From now on,
I'm not letting you out of my sight, OK?

350
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:27,251
Dear heaven. Why is it the weird ones
always go for the cat and not the dog?

351
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,712
Bath time for you, buddy.

352
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,256
Well, that's the best news
I've heard all day.

353
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,091
The dog's not very bright.

354
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:37,136
Where are you taking me?
Somewhere lovely and special?

355
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,899
Hey, Mario Andretti.

356
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,776
You're driving on
the wrong side of the road,

357
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,613
and I've got an entire pie in my stomach.

358
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,281
Don't worry, Prince.

359
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:00,492
You'll feel better
when we get back to Carlyle.

360
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,830
Excuse me. Yes, hello. Hobbs here.

361
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:10,377
Hobbs. This is Manfred Dargis here.
A terrible thing has happened.

362
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:14,214
Prince is missing.
We've searched everywhere.

363
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,300
- Prince is missing?
- Missing?

364
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:21,347
- This is a rather sudden development.
- Actually, it's quite common.

365
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,475
In the absence or, in this case,
the death of an owner,

366
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,354
it can be quite confusing
and disorienting to a cat.

367
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:32,149
Let's face it,
the brain's the size of a gumball.

368
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,986
All the same, it seems rather fishy to me.

369
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:39,114
I don't particularly care
what it seems to you.

370
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:43,577
Legally, since he is gone,
the title of the Carlyle estate falls to me.

371
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,663
Am I not correct?

372
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,249
Yes, very well.

373
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,751
Goodbye.

374
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:57,132
He's up to something.
He's got some plan for the estate.

375
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,051
And I want to find out what.

376
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:08,852
- Miss Abby Westminster, I presume.
- Lord Dargis. An absolute pleasure. Hello.

377
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,858
I'm so pleased you've shown
such an interest in our little enterprise.

378
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,653
Well, my investors are very interested.

379
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:21,782
- Cheers, dear.
- To a long-lasting business relationship.

380
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,951
To Carlyle Resort and Spa.

381
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:31,166
Allow me to introduce you to my dream.

382
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,547
- What's this?
- A state-of-the-art spa,

383
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:40,968
meditation garden
and, of course, luxury condominium.

384
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,930
But what of the woodland
and barnyard areas?

385
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,558
Allow me.

386
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,146
- If you would.
- Very clever.

387
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:57,317
No woodland. No barnyard area. Gone.

388
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,821
So what will you do with all the animals?

389
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:07,494
Let's just say, those we don't chase off
we will serve up to the guests.

390
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,666
I must alert the others at once.

391
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:27,931
Bus driver, pull it over. I gotta pie belch
coming up that might break your windows.

392
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,363
Come on, Prince.

393
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:51,872
Yeah. I used to be known as Prince,
but you can just call me Gar... field.

394
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:56,001
Wow. Get a load of this dump.

395
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,716
Thanks. No pet door?

396
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,720
Holy cow. I can hear my footsteps.

397
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:10,682
Mom, Dad, I'm home.

398
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,894
- Your Highness.
- You talking to me, Froggy?

399
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,563
It's me, your trusty servant Winston.

400
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:21,026
Warning: I don't fight fair.
I scratch and I bite.

401
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,737
It's all right, sire. All is well now.

402
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,823
- You're home.
- Home?

403
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:29,493
Retirement home? Happy home?
What is this, an insane asylum?

404
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,287
- Am I being kidnapped?
- Very funny, sire.

405
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:37,000
Your loyal subjects await you.
They need to be comforted by your words.

406
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,169
Trust me, windbag.

407
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,839
There's no way I'm gonna give a speech
to a bunch of strange...

408
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,925
And then, following your words,
a royal feast.

409
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:49,304
I think I'm just gonna do a tight
two minutes, see if that'll calm 'em down.

410
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,890
Oyez.

411
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,018
Prince Xll has returned.

412
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:00,691
Thank you, windbag,
for that slobbering introduction.

413
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,734
Hello, everybody.

414
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:09,283
Listen up.
Is this an audience or a landscape?

415
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:12,619
Okay, great to be back here at the palace.

416
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:16,999
I look out and I see a sea
of dumb barnyard animals.

417
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:20,085
I'm here in your country
to break up a romance

418
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,921
between the guy
who owns the house I live in

419
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,673
and a girl who's way out of his league.

420
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:27,050
I know that whatever it is that you have,

421
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,136
there's some sort of affliction
that produces

422
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,763
this glazed look behind your eyes.

423
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,307
I hope you defeat it.

424
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:36,894
I wish I could take every one of you
home with me. Thank you.

425
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:40,105
- I killed.
- Very funny, sire. Well done.

426
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,900
I didn't realize it was amateur hour.

427
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:46,069
- What's up with Prince?
- He's on the catnip again.

428
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:50,073
- Chaps, have I got news for you!
- What's the word, Claudius?

429
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:53,660
Dargis is going to bulldoze the barnyard
and feed us to the tourists.

430
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:57,915
Let him try. He'll have to deal with
these fists of fury, won't he?

431
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,043
Calm yourselves, everybody.

432
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,212
We're all right as long as Prince is alive.

433
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,966
Well, obviously that feline
is not Prince, you idiots.

434
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:11,178
He's not even the cat
formerly known as Prince.

435
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,807
He doesn't have to be Prince.

436
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:19,978
He just has to look like him.
If he fooled me, he'll fool them.

437
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:23,649
But what's to stop Dargis
from getting rid of this cat too?

438
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:27,569
McBunny is right.
We must protect this cat at all costs.

439
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,821
Our fates rely on it.

440
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,450
Mr. and Mrs. Jon Arbuckle.

441
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,954
Liz Arbuckle. Elizabeth Arbuckle.

442
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,623
Listen, you dolt.
There's been a coup d'état.

443
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:43,877
Attempted murder most foul.
I am Prince Xll of Carlyle.

444
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,006
You there, with the wise
and thoughtful look.

445
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,341
Hello.

446
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:52,052
Convince this man there's been a mix-up.

447
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:55,639
- Garfield, I want you in my wedding party.
- Wedding party?

448
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:59,643
- Think you can hold a basket of flowers?
- Enough of the grooming, you dunce.

449
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:02,145
My subjects face mortal jeopardy.

450
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,983
Dog, approach.

451
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:11,738
We must plan my escape, and I'm relying
on your expedience and cunning.

452
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,702
Okey-dokey. New plan.

453
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,706
Call my pumpkin, windbag.
I'm ready to roll.

454
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:24,543
- Roll? Where to?
- You know. To the hotel. To Jon.

455
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:28,005
Your master? The one who's
leaving you for his new wife?

456
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:31,925
He's not leaving me.
It's more of a temporary insanity thing.

457
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:37,180
Garfield, your master's started a new life.
It's time for you to begin yours.

458
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,641
Come on. I want to show you something.

459
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,269
Do you have any idea
what runs through your veins?

460
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,647
- Yesterday's dinner, I guess.
- Royal blood, sire.

461
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:49,109
You are the long-lost heir
to the Carlyle throne.

462
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:51,695
You kill me.

463
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:55,866
These are your ancestors
dating back 400 years.

464
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,451
Mine?

465
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:02,372
Wow. Like, I'm a royal cat?

466
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:06,710
Of course. And anything you need
is only a flick of your tail away.

467
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:10,380
A flick of my tail?
So if I said, "Drool on your foot"...

468
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:14,468
Not bad.
How about, "Roll over and whistle Dixie"?

469
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,138
- How's that?
- Nice.

470
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,058
All right, tough one.
Jump up and touch the ceiling.

471
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:24,311
- How's that, sire?
- You don't get up there too high, do you?

472
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:30,859
I give you your royal bedchamber.

473
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,653
I could do some snoozing here. Yeah.

474
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,449
Even a king needs a catnap. Get up.

475
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,576
Get down.

476
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,329
Get up. This baby is spring-loaded.

477
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,999
Why do you think they call me Highness?

478
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,668
You all right? Sire?

479
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,175
- The royal trapeze?
- That is how you ring, sire.

480
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,594
You pull it when you require something.

481
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:00,388
- And what is that?
- Your playhouse.

482
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,808
I needed a playhouse.

483
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:06,019
I've got a house inside of a house.

484
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,606
Does this castle make my butt
look too big?

485
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,566
Fits you like a glove.

486
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,485
- Blimey.
- Pardon.

487
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:17,280
Well struck, sire.
Good tone. Smooth finish.

488
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,866
Well, you took that in the best spirit.

489
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:24,454
- Shall we have a look at the kitchen?
- Did I hear you say "the kitchen"?

490
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,551
Here we are. I present your cookery.

491
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:41,596
- All mine?
- Every morsel, down to the last crumb.

492
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:47,310
Okay, all right.
You can just call me "Your Highness. "

493
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,981
- Moving on up
- Moving on up

494
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:53,650
- To a castle
- Moving on up

495
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:58,321
With lots of servants all doing my will

496
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,324
- I got me a life
- Moving on up

497
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,994
- Without hassle
- Moving on up

498
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:07,956
Sir Garfield is the king of the hill

499
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,918
I sleep on a bed that's real fluffy

500
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,421
I eat from a plate made of gold

501
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:17,257
They feed me until I get stuffy

502
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:20,343
My pasta never gets cold

503
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,512
All of my devoted subjects

504
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,389
They know it's all about me

505
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,934
Folks are so loyal to this cat who is royal

506
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,021
They call me Your Majesty

507
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,689
- Moving on up
- Moving on up

508
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,941
- To a castle
- Moving on up

509
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:39,613
With lots of servants all doing my will

510
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,365
- I got me a life
- Moving on up

511
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,202
- Without hassle
- Moving on up

512
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:50,123
Sir Garfield is the king of the hill

513
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,376
Yeah, you can just drop that anywhere.

514
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,799
I'll give it to you straight.
It's disappointing.

515
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,718
Your doughnuts are dry
and don't have holes,

516
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,763
and your coffee's so weak,
it looks like tea.

517
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:07,098
I don't suppose, Miss Westminster,

518
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:10,810
you could find time in your busy life
for a wealthy duke?

519
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,105
Lord Dargis, I'm afraid I'm taken.

520
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:17,484
As I am myself - by you.

521
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,197
Don't mind me.
I'm just an incorrigible old...

522
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,158
- Cat.
- What?

523
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:29,079
Nothing, nothing. Nothing at all.
Gosh, is that the time already?

524
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:32,290
Time, I've always said, flies like an arrow.

525
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:37,837
Don't be afraid to just show up
and bring some of those lovely investors.

526
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,173
We'll throw a party. Cheerio.

527
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:49,099
Smithee. Did I see Prince in here?

528
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,809
Isn't it remarkable?

529
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:54,479
I found him wandering the streets
of London as I left Willoughby's.

530
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,772
Indeed?

531
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,066
Extraordinary.

532
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:02,529
And where is the little fiend... fellow
at the moment?

533
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:07,450
- I'm sure I don't know, sir.
- Well, I'll maybe take a little look-see.

534
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,869
- Make him welcome.
- Yes, sir.

535
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:19,045
Look at this room, for example.
How would you liven this place up?

536
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,881
But, sire, this castle is centuries old.

537
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,217
It's a museum. It's boring.

538
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,595
And you know what's missing
when your crib is a museum?

539
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,015
- It's called fun.
- Fun?

540
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:34,561
It's not that hard. You gotta get
a running start at something this dull.

541
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,689
This is going to end so badly.

542
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:46,489
- It was already cracked.
- Nothing escapes you, does it, sire?

543
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:50,076
Yeah, I like the way this feels.
You gotta slide, baby.

544
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,790
Don't worry about it.
That one was cracked as well.

545
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,043
I can relax. Oops.

546
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,846
Smithee. Get this thing off of me.

547
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,974
- Let's go try another room.
- Good idea, sire.

548
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,728
I've got the deed
and the paperwork in order

549
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,313
and contacted the solicitors.

550
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:21,274
- We'll be out there on Monday.
- Monday?

551
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,318
But I need more time.

552
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,446
More time? More time for what?

553
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:32,118
Nothing. That'll be fine.

554
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:36,164
We'll be there Monday unless,
by some miracle, Prince returns.

555
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,750
We can only hope, Mr. Hobbs.

556
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:56,351
- What's the news?
- Dargis is sure to make a move on the cat.

557
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:59,979
- The solicitors will be here Monday.
- Right. Good work.

558
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:08,696
Careful. That's high-grade American
cardboard you're tossing around.

559
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:12,742
Beautiful, fellas. Hang the plasma
right over the Slip 'N' Slide.

560
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,912
- Sire, a word?
- Jowls, my man.

561
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:20,667
Guess what your enlightened, all-powerful
ruler has brought to the castle.

562
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,919
I can't wait to hear this.

563
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,588
Don't tell me. A Renaissance painting.

564
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,800
- Foosball. You know? Foosball.
- Foosball?

565
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,885
What does he think this is? A pub?

566
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,263
Just 'cause we don't have
opposable thumbs

567
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,473
doesn't mean we don't play bar games.

568
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,476
Yes, sire, but I feel your life is in danger.

569
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:43,273
Listen, Winnebago - if I may call you that.
When history speaks of me, and she will,

570
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:46,734
I want to be remembered
as the Party Prince.

571
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,445
As you wish.

572
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:53,074
You chaps know me. I'm no snob, right?
But this cat is too much.

573
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:57,954
- He's an embarrassment to our way of life.
- He's a disgrace to the furry race.

574
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,623
"My pillow isn't soft enough.
My TV remote won't work. "

575
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:04,377
Don't get your knickers in a twist.
I know he's a pain in the neck,

576
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,547
but we've just got to
keep him safe till Monday.

577
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:13,052
Yeah. My loyal and fragrant subjects.
Please. Thank you.

578
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,347
Briefly, I hate Mondays. I just hate 'em.

579
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:20,560
Therefore I decree, from this day forward,
there'll be no more Mondays.

580
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,396
- What?
- Got it? Today is Tuesday, then.

581
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,565
Happy Tuesday, everybody.

582
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,067
I think he's lost it.

583
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,362
Like I said, we've just got to
keep him safe till Tuesday.

584
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,868
Hello, Rommel.

585
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,788
I have a present for you.

586
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,208
Prince's favorite pillow.

587
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,586
Sniffy, sniffy, Rommel. Sniffy, sniffy.

588
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,589
Bad pillow.

589
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:53,134
Kill kitty. Kill kitty.

590
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:58,890
What a clever boy.
Eat the cat. Yum, yum, yum.

591
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:04,354
I think you're ready.

592
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:08,024
- Here comes trouble.
- Eat the pussycat. Good chap.

593
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:11,694
- Operation Feline Protection under way.
- I'm on it.

594
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,043
Oops.

595
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,255
Bon appétit.

596
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:35,593
Here, kitty, kitty. Come to Rommel.

597
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:39,305
Where are you, my little furry friend?

598
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,976
- Hello, Rommel.
- Eat kitty.

599
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,230
No, no kitty, Rommel,
but we have something better to chew on.

600
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:50,525
- No kitty?
- That's right, no kitty.

601
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,611
Bring Lord Dargis's new trousers, please.

602
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,530
Pig, the trousers.

603
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:05,123
- Trousers.
- Thank you, Sam.

604
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:09,502
And now, Rommel,
how about a nice tug of war?

605
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:22,348
Lord Dargis better watch out
next time Rommel's on the loose.

606
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:28,354
Hello, Smithee.

607
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,357
You're in good spirits today, sir.

608
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,819
Yes. For some reason
I feel a great burden has been lifted.

609
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:36,070
A burden, sir?

610
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,865
What do you make of
my new suit, Smithee?

611
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,576
Very smart, sir.

612
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,788
Smithee, I've invited Miss Westminster
for tea on Monday

613
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,458
and it's extremely important
she feel welcome.

614
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:51,085
Bring up a bottle of
the very best champagne

615
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,463
and set out the Prince Royal china.

616
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:56,382
Silver service. You know the type of thing.

617
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,051
Very good, sir.

618
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,142
Trousers.

619
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:13,149
Yes, I'd like to speak
to Miss Westminster, please.

620
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,152
Hello, Rommel.

621
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,030
Did we enjoy our little snack, then?

622
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:22,617
- Trousers?
- Miss Westminster.

623
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,579
- Trousers!
- Would you like to pop over and have...

624
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,301
- Isn't this fantastic?
- Yeah.

625
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,887
- Who ordered the pasta?
- It's for the kitty.

626
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:46,432
Good Lord. What gruel is this?

627
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:50,144
Quite right, old boy.
They must have given me yours.

628
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:52,855
Garfield, since when
do you say no to lasagna?

629
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,484
You do realize I'm a cat, don't you, sir?

630
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:59,737
- He doesn't seem himself.
- He's probably jet-lagged.

631
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:04,450
I suppose I should probably force down
a bite or two to keep up my strength.

632
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,830
It does have a unique texture.

633
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:13,501
So, Liz, I don't know if you've noticed,
but I've been kind of anxious to...

634
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:17,547
Why am I clapping?
I'm sorry. What were you saying?

635
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:21,634
Spot on. Never have I tasted its equal.

636
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,807
Garfield, that's gross.

637
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:32,145
Please, sir, may I have some more?

638
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,619
Does a Great Dane live here?

639
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:52,081
It's a Carlyle log, my lord.
A savory of liver and spleen,

640
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,834
served in a sleeve of sheep's intestines.

641
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:58,421
And you're supposed to eat it?
What is this? FearFactor?

642
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:00,798
Intestines, spleen...

643
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:03,801
- I'm the king, right?
- Prince, actually.

644
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:07,305
- Same difference. I rule, yes?
- Yes, Your Highness.

645
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,640
Great. Then feed this to the humans

646
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:14,479
and just bring me a piping hot dish
of lasagna, OK?

647
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:18,024
I'll see to it at once, sire.

648
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:24,113
Now it says we add the ricotta cheese.

649
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:27,992
Ducks, you're supposed to sift the flour,
not sit in it.

650
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,413
Don't yell at us. We're not the ones
who drank all the cooking sherry.

651
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,584
Oh, the female ferrets sing this song

652
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:38,920
Nigel! Ooh! Nigel! Ha!

653
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:41,547
The female ferrets can't be wrong...

654
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:45,384
Carrots make everything better,
and it can't hurt lasagna.

655
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:49,931
What the heck is...?

656
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,975
That was close.

657
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,353
Slip in the eggs, ooze in the tomatoes,

658
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:58,523
now stir the whole thing up.
Let the bowl sizzle.

659
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,817
- No, sizzle. You know.
- Okay.

660
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:04,153
Hold it right here, all you animals.

661
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:06,447
What goes on here, Winston?

662
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:09,242
We're preparing the royal lasagna, sire.

663
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,244
Unless you'd prefer another dish.

664
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:14,831
Did you say "dish"?
Lasagna's not a "dish," windbag.

665
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,333
It's a way of life, a state of being,

666
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,877
man's one perfect achievement.

667
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:23,339
What did the Indians serve
to the Pilgrims? Lasagna.

668
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:27,844
What did Marie Antoinette scream
to the rabble? "Let them eat lasagna. "

669
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:31,180
What did Neil Armstrong say
when he landed on the moon?

670
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,808
"That's one small slice of lasagna. "

671
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:39,230
It's not a dish. It's the stuff of dreams.
It's the food of the gods.

672
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,816
It's what's for lunch.

673
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,528
Yeah, well, the problem is
it seems we've mucked it up.

674
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:48,030
You just need a little guidance, that's all.

675
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,454
Where's the flour? Who's got it?

676
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:59,000
- I need a mixing bowl.
- One large mixing bowl.

677
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,044
And someone to mix it. Thank you.

678
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,757
Much obliged.

679
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,973
Cheba, did you remember
to wash your hooves?

680
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,768
Ladies. Thank you so much.

681
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,479
Strike. Strike.

682
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,315
A little outside.

683
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,151
Step on it, will you? I need that dough.

684
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,572
Yeah. We'll need about
a half a pound of this.

685
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:33,326
What are barnyard animals doing
in the kitchen? Leave at once.

686
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,786
This is completely against my health code.

687
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:38,039
Getting hot. Turn on the fan, somebody.

688
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:41,167
What are you doing? Get away from there.

689
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:46,130
Sorry. Proof more accidents
happen in the kitchen

690
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:47,632
than any other room in the house.

691
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,926
Where did that big ball of dough go?

692
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:53,846
All I see are magnificent ribbons
of perfection.

693
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:58,184
It's lasagna, not shish kebab.

694
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:01,187
Taste that. Is that too sweet for you?

695
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,358
One time.

696
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:17,536
Here comes the parsley.

697
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:22,041
All right, bring it in, bring it in.
Back, back, back. Good.

698
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,377
I need somebody with a hard head.

699
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,712
Thank you.

700
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,384
It's out of our hands now.

701
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:40,393
Nice bit of cheese.

702
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:43,145
This lasagna's fabulous.

703
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:48,567
- That's a bit of all right, that is.
- Those Italians got it right, didn't they?

704
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:52,238
- Two cheeses.
- That is delicious.

705
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:55,658
- Yeah, not bad on short notice.
- It's beautiful.

706
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:59,328
What did I tell you? If you just let me
be your king and lead you, all right?

707
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,497
- Any more?
- One more piece.

708
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,541
- Would anyone mind if I...
- It's mine.

709
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,918
- Move.
- Easy. Hold up a moment.

710
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:09,213
- That piece has Nigel's name on it.
- I said it's mine.

711
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:12,758
- Get your paws off it.
- Please. I command you.

712
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:15,261
Leave room for dessert.

713
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,015
Wants the bull now.

714
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:22,351
Half an inch adjustment
from his last shot. Nearly.

715
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:26,355
Heavens, I fear there was
something urgent

716
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,691
to which I was supposed to attend,

717
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:32,653
and yet I can't for the life of me
begin to recall what it was.

718
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,699
- You really like it?
- I do. It's great. Thank you.

719
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:38,200
Let me see.

720
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,038
I gotta go.

721
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:45,916
Are you sure I can't go with you
to this castle tour? They won't mind.

722
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,919
It's a conservancy function
for speakers only.

723
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:52,256
I guess the woman who owned the place
was a big animal lover.

724
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,549
Hang with the guys.

725
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:58,971
Odie could use a walk and Garfield
could use some serious ab work.

726
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,933
Anyway, I'll be back soon. Have fun, boys.

727
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:08,689
My entire world seems to revolve around
napping, television and lasagna.

728
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:13,360
Still, I'm plagued by a vague notion
of a duty unfulfilled.

729
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:16,322
Oh, well. Back to sleep.

730
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,784
What is it, woof woof?

731
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:23,079
"Castles of England"?
Good Lord, there it is.

732
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:27,750
Carlyle Castle on the Upper Thames.
Brilliant, Odie.

733
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:31,879
All this time I took you for,
well, a complete simpleton.

734
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:37,009
Now destiny calls.
To the battlements. Sound the horns.

735
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,011
For king and country.

736
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:43,015
Farewell, my loyal squire.
The legend cont...

737
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,683
What ho.

738
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:48,979
Garfield?

739
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:56,445
Okay, sore bottom,
a little disoriented, but undeterred.

740
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,738
Garfield?

741
00:51:58,323 --> 00:52:00,616
Now, which way's the river?

742
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,160
- I think this way.
- Garfield.

743
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,620
Sorry, Jon.

744
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:15,631
Here it is.
Now one needs some kind of conveyance.

745
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,134
Hello.

746
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:23,889
It's an awfully long way down,
but I must, and I shall, and I...

747
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:45,911
Well, Miss Westminster,
I have the papers all drawn up.

748
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,789
We need only sign them
and it's on to the groundbreaking.

749
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:52,209
Wonderful. I'd like to move forward
as soon as possible.

750
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:55,087
Just think - bulldozers, paving machines,

751
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:59,341
busily transforming this dump
into beautiful luxury condos.

752
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:04,638
You and I striding through
centuries of dust like giants,

753
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,933
surveying our emerging empire.

754
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:11,478
Two proud parents.

755
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:16,192
I'll just check on Smithee,

756
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,569
see if tea is ready.

757
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,008
Filthy monsters.

758
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:47,473
Come back here, you smelly creature.
Come here.

759
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,975
Pigs, mark your man.

760
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,479
Come here, you smelly individual.

761
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:59,902
You know what? I got two words
for that guy: "You're fired. "

762
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:02,571
If only it were that simple, sire.

763
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,867
Swine.

764
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:11,497
- Is there a problem, sir?
- There's a bull drinking my champagne,

765
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,500
the pool's full of wild animals,
and a pig tried to kill me.

766
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,752
Yes, I would say there was a problem.

767
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:20,256
- I'll tend to it, sir.
- You'll tend to it immediately.

768
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,092
And we'll have tea indoors.
Do you think you could handle that?

769
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:24,969
Thank you. Good chap.

770
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:35,854
- Has there been an accident?
- I'm afraid tea will have to wait till later.

771
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:50,619
He's about 42½ pounds,
orange fur - more like a burnt sienna -

772
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:53,622
and he answers to the name Garfield.

773
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,586
Okay. Well, fortunately Scotland Yard
isn't very busy this week,

774
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:03,132
so we'll put together
a task force of our best men

775
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:07,469
and turn all our resources and attention
towards finding your fat cat.

776
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,763
- Really?
- No.

777
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,101
Come on, Odie.

778
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:26,864
Now, Rommel, it's really quite simple.

779
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,576
Me, Prince.

780
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:34,121
Prince, me.

781
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:37,291
Provider of food, food.

782
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,335
All right, guv'nor.

783
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:44,548
Yum yum.

784
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:48,927
- Kill.
- Kitty.

785
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,848
Attaboy, Rommel. There you go.

786
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:55,642
Well done. That's the spirit.

787
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:58,187
Bad boy. Bad boy.

788
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:00,022
Come on, get along.

789
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:03,776
Smithee. How are you?

790
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:06,695
Do me a favor. Have that polished.
There's a good chap.

791
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,989
What's on your mind, Smithee?

792
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:13,994
Mr. Hobbs' office called.
Are the solicitors convening again, sir?

793
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,955
It's nothing at all, Smithee.

794
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,708
Papers to sign, you know. Boring.

795
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:23,337
Incidentally, when did you last
have a holiday, Smithee?

796
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,422
Holiday, sir?

797
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:29,259
- I can't remember.
- Seriously, man?

798
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:32,179
What an embarrassing oversight
on my part.

799
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:36,308
I insist you have a week's holiday,
starting today.

800
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:39,812
- I don't know. I don't think I can...
- I won't hear a word of it.

801
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,648
I can just see you cycling in the Dordogne,

802
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:46,402
fighting the wild boar in Tristan da Cunha.

803
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:50,823
Farewell, wind to your sails
and bon voyage, Smithee.

804
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,908
Well, then,

805
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:55,452
thank you, sir.

806
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,838
What am I gonna do?
How am I supposed to find Garfield?

807
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:08,632
London's really big.

808
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,807
I don't care about some
alien love baby, OK?

809
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:19,017
I'm worried about Garfield.

810
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:23,397
Odie, you know what?
You're being a real...

811
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:29,027
"Lady Eleanor of Carlyle has left her entire
estate to her beloved cat, Prince Xll. "

812
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:32,448
Maybe someone mistook
this cat for Garfield.

813
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:33,907
Odie, come on. Come on, buddy.

814
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:39,705
The Venetian crystal chandeliers were
commissioned by the third Earl of Carlyle

815
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:42,374
in the late 18th century.

816
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:47,796
Over here we have several family portraits
painted by the Dutch master, Van Dyck.

817
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:51,592
These are amongst the many treasures
to be found at Carlyle.

818
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:55,387
Rule Britannia
Britannia catches waves

819
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:59,308
Hogwash. I tell you,
this cat is mocking us at every turn.

820
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:00,851
Preston, calm yourself.

821
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:03,270
We're only doing what is best
for everybody.

822
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:06,565
How much longer
must we sustain this charade?

823
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:10,611
I can't believe this cat is so stupid
as to think he's actually royalty.

824
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:15,824
Well, he does,
and, house cat or not, we need him.

825
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,242
House cat?

826
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:20,037
- Just have a little patience.
- Patience?

827
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:25,292
Admit it, Winston. This buffoon
couldn't groom the paws of a real king.

828
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:26,668
Buffoon?

829
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:32,985
Golly, this is without a doubt
my all-time crummiest moment.

830
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:43,412
Jon. Man, I've been such
a stupid, selfish cat.

831
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:47,541
I've lost my friend. I gotta find him.

832
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:52,838
The original medieval kitchen
has stood on this site since 1485.

833
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:56,550
Yes, it's big, it's old and it's musty.

834
00:59:56,634 --> 01:00:01,513
Lord Dargis, please meet the tour group
from the Royal Animal Conservancy.

835
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:05,934
By all means, save the little darlings.
That's my motto.

836
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:09,771
Big fan of Free Willy, Born Free,
all the Free movies.

837
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:12,566
Bravo. Now, off you go.

838
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:16,445
If you come this way, we'll visit
some of the underground passages.

839
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:20,449
Hello. Welcome to Carlyle Castle, my dear.

840
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:22,034
Thank you. It's beautiful.

841
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:23,702
Well, that makes two of you.

842
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:26,997
Did I mention
how much I abhor fox-hunting?

843
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:30,167
- Unless, of course, in self-defense.
- Bye.

844
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:32,711
If I may,

845
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,922
- one question...
- Liz.

846
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:38,967
The same as our own dear queen. Cordial?

847
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:42,471
- One question, Liz.
- Liz?

848
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:46,725
What would you say if I were to donate
one of my priceless oil paintings

849
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,560
to your conservancy?

850
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:53,231
- Thank you?
- But how would you say it?

851
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:57,319
That royal sleaze is hitting on Liz.

852
01:00:57,403 --> 01:01:00,947
Perhaps you would consider
dining with me at the castle tonight?

853
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:04,201
Nobody hits on my best friend's girlfriend

854
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:05,786
and succeeds.

855
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,582
Mr. Piñata Head.

856
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:13,335
You.

857
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:17,130
- Me?
- Excuse me for one moment.

858
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:20,092
- Sure, but...
- Mi castle es su castle.

859
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:30,936
Your nine lives are up.

860
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:33,230
No. No, not now.

861
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:36,983
Good Lord. Do these people never sleep?

862
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,151
Why now?

863
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:40,946
Mr. Hobbs. Punctual as usual.

864
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,282
Just taking out the rubbish.
Won't be a jiffy.

865
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:48,203
Please. Okay, you got me.

866
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:53,166
You are so stupid.

867
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,802
- Dungeon.
- I'm just a cat.

868
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:14,187
Please. I'm so weak.

869
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:16,982
And you're so strong.

870
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,483
So powerful.

871
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:23,280
You creep.

872
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:27,242
There's more than one way
to skin a royal cat.

873
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:31,288
I'm not a royal cat.
I'm a self-centered house cat. Wait. Wait.

874
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:34,708
What? You think I'm gonna crack in here?

875
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:39,671
No. This is gonna be a treat. I'm finally
gonna have some quality alone time.

876
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:42,966
I'm gonna write that novel
I've been putting off.

877
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:47,095
I'm gonna learn a couple of languages
and start a new work-out regimen.

878
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:51,808
I'm gonna lose all this, get myself
in top physical condition. Thank you.

879
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,685
Yeah.

880
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:58,064
I love it here.
You've done me an enormous favor.

881
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:00,025
Who's laughing now?

882
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:17,250
It's nice to get away
from the urban sprawl.

883
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,753
Carlyle, 28 miles.

884
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,714
Going my way?

885
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:27,969
Piece of cake, really.

886
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:32,057
So we make a left up ahead.

887
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:38,647
Right turn. Thanks, buddy.

888
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:46,863
- I'm afraid there's just no sign of him.
- Really?

889
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:50,617
Well, then, let's make it official.

890
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:52,828
Well, if we must, we must.

891
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:55,580
Then there's the time I got hit by that car,

892
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:59,000
and that time that I ate
that six-day-old halibut.

893
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:03,046
That's only seven lives. I got two more.

894
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:05,757
All right. I'm gonna get out of this.

895
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:12,138
- Bingo.
- Winston and I have come to your rescue.

896
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:15,392
Took you long enough.
Did you hear my stomach growling?

897
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:18,270
No, but we heard
your tiresome monologue.

898
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:20,105
Bad halibut indeed.

899
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:26,570
- Let's get you out of here, Your Highness.
- Winster.

900
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:30,156
The solicitors are here.
We have to move quickly.

901
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:37,205
- Then we luncheon, Your Royal Highness.
- Yeah, you can drop that shtick, drool boy.

902
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,374
I heard you and the bird.

903
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:42,002
How about the "house cat" part?
I love that.

904
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:45,714
All right, all right,
so we weren't exactly honest.

905
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,341
We had to do it.
What would you have done?

906
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:50,468
Save your breath, chubby cheeks.

907
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:54,931
I shall abdicate my throne
and return to my TV chair.

908
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:59,060
- You were our only hope.
- The only hope of the hopeless.

909
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:01,646
What do they want - blood?

910
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:05,567
I've been eating and sleeping
my heart out for these animals.

911
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:07,235
Still not enough.

912
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:11,990
Like I'm not as good
as a royal cat could be?

913
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:04,334
I so knew you weren't me.

914
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:06,962
And you must be Garfield.

915
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:11,174
- How do you know my name?
- I've lived your life for the past few days.

916
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:15,011
Yes, if ever a man loved a cat,
it's your Jon.

917
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:18,431
Return to him, Garfield.
Return to your home.

918
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:23,979
Your Highness,
you don't have to tell me twice. Bye-bye.

919
01:06:25,022 --> 01:06:29,818
Sire, thank heavens.
You've returned. Thank heavens.

920
01:06:29,902 --> 01:06:33,822
- It's the real Prince, the genuine article.
- Yes, my friends.

921
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:37,575
I have returned to you
at this, our darkest hour.

922
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:40,829
So, Winny,
what exactly is Lord Dargis up to?

923
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:44,207
He intends to level our homes
and kill us all.

924
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,001
Okay.

925
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:51,506
Well, in that case,
I decree that we pack our bags

926
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:54,300
and get our scraggy bottoms out of here.

927
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:57,262
- Perhaps to the castle next door.
- Oh, boy.

928
01:06:57,346 --> 01:06:59,723
- That was inspirational.
- Brilliant.

929
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:02,100
I am so fired up.

930
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:05,729
- I have to believe we can do better.
- I thought you were leaving.

931
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:10,400
Button the beak, Froot Loops,
or I'll stick that thing on backwards.

932
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:15,447
Look, Lord Doofus is just another bully.
And what do we do to bullies?

933
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:17,532
Well, generally, we run from them.

934
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:22,078
No, we don't leave.
We stand and we kick royal butt.

935
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:26,791
Trust me, if you beasts can bake
a two-cheese lasagna,

936
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,710
you can beat Dargis.

937
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:30,920
Well, do you have a plan, Garfield?

938
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,881
Tell you what.
For the duration of this battle,

939
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:36,009
I would prefer to be called G-Cat,

940
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:40,221
and we have two plans.

941
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,432
Teamwork. Yes.

942
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,982
Hey, girlie dog.

943
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:57,489
Yeah, you, girlie girl.
You're such a silly, sissy dog.

944
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:04,829
- Go. Go!
- The game's afoot.

945
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:13,296
Sissy, silly dog.

946
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:16,007
You don't move so good, bozo.

947
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:25,183
Here, kitty, kitty.

948
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:32,107
Mr. Stinky Dog.

949
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:34,526
Hey, loco.

950
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:36,319
Oh, no.

951
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,988
Run away.

952
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:54,045
The loss of Prince - I'm not quite sure
any of us will ever get over it.

953
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:57,715
Prince and Carlyle Court were one.

954
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:04,556
Sometimes it's almost as if
his spirit were still...

955
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:16,776
- His spirit's still what?
- Still roaming the grounds.

956
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:23,449
I wonder if you could excuse me
for a little while.

957
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:26,035
Do you hear running water?

958
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:30,915
I won't be long.

959
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:34,669
He's a bit of a tool, don't you think?

960
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:41,676
- Yes?
- Lord Dargis. Am I early?

961
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:44,762
Only just, Miss Westminster. Only just.

962
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,931
Please, please, please.

963
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,518
I was just finishing something up.

964
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:53,354
I wonder if you'd like to wait in the library.

965
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:54,480
Okay.

966
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:58,860
- Make yourself at home. Have a seat.
- Thank you.

967
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:02,864
- Tally-ho.
- On the other hand, this simply won't do.

968
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:06,534
- Smithee's been painting again.
- I can't smell anything.

969
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:10,830
You never can. Next thing you know,
you're salsa dancing in your knickers.

970
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:13,124
- What?
- I won't be long.

971
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:25,303
Mr. Dargis,
will we be starting sometime today?

972
01:10:25,429 --> 01:10:27,805
Absolutely, Mr. Hobbs.

973
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:29,599
Hello again.

974
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:33,478
- What's the matter?
- Matter with what?

975
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:36,189
- You screamed.
- No, I didn't.

976
01:10:36,273 --> 01:10:38,775
Why don't you adjourn to my study?

977
01:10:44,823 --> 01:10:47,033
And I'll retrieve the papers.

978
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:58,002
Where are you, you red-headed devil?

979
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:11,683
Mr. Fancy Pants.

980
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:17,855
Wait till I get my hands on you.

981
01:11:18,732 --> 01:11:20,858
Bring it on.

982
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:39,210
Dargis.

983
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:42,922
I got two words for yous: me yow.

984
01:11:43,882 --> 01:11:45,758
Come here, you.

985
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:54,142
No, you won't do.
I specifically requested a feline masseuse.

986
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:03,818
Somebody get this thing off of me.

987
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:12,869
Hey, bozo.

988
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:14,954
Yeah, you, buster.

989
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:23,546
Stupid, red-haired,

990
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,631
flea-bitten...

991
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:34,515
Lord D... What is...

992
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:38,102
- What is that?
- I felt a slight chill.

993
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:40,605
I thought a simple wrap
would be just the ticket.

994
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:42,357
- There.
- There what?

995
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:47,820
There is absolutely no reason
why you can't have a cool, refreshing drink

996
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:52,241
to make you feel calmer
in this steamy weather. Wait in the room.

997
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:54,035
Stupid cat.

998
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:57,622
Nobody makes an idiot out of me.

999
01:13:05,589 --> 01:13:07,632
Upsy-daisy.

1000
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:08,883
Medic.

1001
01:13:09,301 --> 01:13:11,969
- Well done, old man.
- Thank you.

1002
01:13:12,096 --> 01:13:15,139
Never seen a welcome mat on the way out.

1003
01:13:17,142 --> 01:13:21,813
- Get your cameras ready, ladies.
- Come back here, you flea-bitten monster.

1004
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,675
Trousers.

1005
01:13:57,891 --> 01:14:00,518
Trousers.

1006
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:13,322
- Target sighted.
- Shaken him off.

1007
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:16,409
- Pull.
- Take that.

1008
01:14:17,327 --> 01:14:18,744
And that.

1009
01:14:19,496 --> 01:14:22,874
- Down a bit. Down a bit. Up.
- Bob's your uncle.

1010
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:28,588
Good Lord. It's a conspiracy.

1011
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:36,679
- Oh, dear.
- Trousers.

1012
01:14:36,763 --> 01:14:40,016
Smithee!

1013
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:43,936
Excuse me. Sir?

1014
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:46,647
- Is that Carlyle Castle?
- It is.

1015
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:51,736
Maybe you can help me.
Have you seen a cat that looks like this?

1016
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,196
Yes.

1017
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:56,407
That's Prince, the cat of Carlyle.

1018
01:14:57,075 --> 01:14:59,952
It's also Garfield, the cat of the cul-de-sac.

1019
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:03,039
You mean you have a cat
that's Prince's Doppelgänger?

1020
01:15:03,123 --> 01:15:06,167
No. I'm saying they look exactly alike,

1021
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:08,503
and there's a chance
they may have got mixed up.

1022
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:09,587
I see.

1023
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:14,759
There you are, man.

1024
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:19,388
Good God.
What happened to your clothes?

1025
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:22,767
Indeed, it's been that kind of day.

1026
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:25,269
Mr. Dargis, I demand an explanation.

1027
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:28,022
I had no choice.

1028
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:31,400
The cat just won't die.

1029
01:15:31,818 --> 01:15:36,155
- What did you say?
- You will sign the deeds over to me.

1030
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:39,325
- Cat or no cat.
- Oh, my.

1031
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:40,701
Mr. Hobbs, you were right.

1032
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:44,288
Lord Dargis was willing to go
to any lengths to get the estate.

1033
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:47,917
- I can see you're busy. I'm just gonna...
- Young lady.

1034
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:51,212
Get over there.

1035
01:15:51,296 --> 01:15:54,465
Traitoress.
You were working with them all along.

1036
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:03,432
Odie. Odie, wait for me. Odie.

1037
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:06,185
Get on with it.

1038
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:09,939
Hello, everyone. Sorry I'm late.
Shall I ring for tea?

1039
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:12,066
It's Prince, and he's alive.

1040
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:16,404
I am bushed.
All this running-for-my-life stuff.

1041
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:19,532
What say we break for lunch,
take a quick nap

1042
01:16:19,616 --> 01:16:21,242
and pick it up later? Sound good?

1043
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:24,161
There are two of you little monsters.

1044
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:28,332
For those of you keeping score at home,
that's 18 lives.

1045
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,918
This is unbelievable. Two cats?

1046
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:34,338
No matter. I've plenty of ammunition.

1047
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:39,302
Something's biting me.

1048
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:48,102
- Odie, let him go.
- Help!

1049
01:16:48,186 --> 01:16:51,272
Your lunatic dog just bit my bottom.

1050
01:16:52,816 --> 01:16:54,358
All right.

1051
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:57,111
Well played, you.

1052
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:00,698
- Hey, look. It's little Jon.
- Good show, old man.

1053
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:03,451
I'll go quietly.

1054
01:17:03,535 --> 01:17:04,952
- Jon?
- Liz.

1055
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:06,287
What's going on?

1056
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,998
- Well, hello, my dear.
- Hello.

1057
01:17:09,082 --> 01:17:11,792
And not a moment too soon.

1058
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:15,838
Is this a part of the tour?

1059
01:17:15,922 --> 01:17:19,842
- Let her go.
- All in good time. Now, if you'd be so kind.

1060
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:24,388
- OK. Stay calm, OK?
- Mr. Hobbs, the papers, please.

1061
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:26,390
I've seen enough. Wanna call your weasel?

1062
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:27,975
Sic him, Nigel.

1063
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:31,771
I'm a ferret, and I mean business.
Trouser-leg business.

1064
01:17:33,565 --> 01:17:37,902
I'll take a leg, please. On second thoughts,
I'll have some white meat.

1065
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:42,073
Good Lord.
There's a wild animal in my trousers.

1066
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:50,456
Who's next, then?

1067
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:53,793
Glass jaw. He can dish it out,
but he can't take it.

1068
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:56,587
That was amazing. Are you OK?

1069
01:17:57,005 --> 01:18:00,383
Yeah, I never felt better.

1070
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:05,054
- Well done, Garfield. I was rooting for you.
- Did you hear something?

1071
01:18:05,138 --> 01:18:09,141
- Yes, one did.
- I'm here to discuss my new position.

1072
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:11,435
There he is, gentlemen.

1073
01:18:11,561 --> 01:18:14,105
Come along. There's a good boy.

1074
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:19,068
It was the animals, you know. Plotting,
planning, every one of them against me.

1075
01:18:19,152 --> 01:18:21,237
I assume that will be all, sir?

1076
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:24,448
Smithee. He'll vouch for me.

1077
01:18:24,574 --> 01:18:25,700
Smithee.

1078
01:18:25,784 --> 01:18:29,328
Odie, thank you.
You're a hero and a gentleman.

1079
01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:34,792
Whoa. There are two Garfields?
How can you tell them apart?

1080
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:37,211
You forgot imbecile.

1081
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:38,796
Garfield.

1082
01:18:39,297 --> 01:18:44,176
Liz, I've been trying to get the courage up
to ask you something all week.

1083
01:18:44,928 --> 01:18:46,429
And...

1084
01:18:49,307 --> 01:18:51,600
Come on. Really?

1085
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,520
Looking for something?

1086
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:03,738
Thanks, pal.

1087
01:19:06,658 --> 01:19:08,743
Liz, will you marry me?

1088
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:10,578
Yes.

1089
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:19,336
You know a dog's mouth
is cleaner than a human's?

1090
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:22,298
Come on. The coast is clear.

1091
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:34,143
Let's hear it for the cats.

1092
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:39,273
- Go, Garfield.
- That's right. Come on.

1093
01:19:39,357 --> 01:19:41,567
Can you do the Carlyle jig?

1094
01:19:41,693 --> 01:19:43,527
It goes like this.

1095
01:19:45,071 --> 01:19:47,406
- Can you do this?
- Boogaloo.

1096
01:19:52,829 --> 01:19:54,830
Bust a move, man.

1097
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:57,416
No, it's something like this, here.

1098
01:19:57,959 --> 01:20:02,880
And so, my loyal subjects,
I leave you with a final legacy.

1099
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:06,717
Cannonball.

1100
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,687
Brilliant party, sire.

1101
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:23,275
Yeah, when the going gets tough,
the great ones party.

1102
01:20:31,576 --> 01:20:35,079
- Who wants to play Marco Polo?
- Marco.

1103
01:20:35,413 --> 01:20:40,751
I refuse to partake in this sinful display
of hedonism. Those nuts look good.

1104
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:44,463
Get a load of this. Bombs away.

1105
01:20:44,756 --> 01:20:46,841
I love this pond.

1106
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:50,511
We rule the pool, goosy.
Give me some feathers.

1107
01:21:02,774 --> 01:21:04,483
Watch the ears.

1108
01:21:05,777 --> 01:21:08,946
Thank you. You're so kind.

1109
01:21:14,452 --> 01:21:16,745
Odie, could you beat it, please?

1110
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:21,125
It's good to be king.
