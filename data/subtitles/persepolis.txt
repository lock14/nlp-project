00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,860
Passport, please.

3
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,991
Miss,
your ticket and your passport.

4
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,720
Marji, stop running!

5
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,139
Look! Nioucha is here!

6
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,018
Marji, you've really grown up!

7
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,603
Did you bring me a present?

8
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,772
How is Paris?
Did you see Bruce Lee?

9
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,607
And the Eiffel Tower?

10
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:11,817
Welcome to Teheran.

11
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,026
We've missed you!

12
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,027
Your luggage...

13
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,571
No, it's me!

14
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,531
Come on! They're waiting for us.

15
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,575
I remember.

16
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,327
Back then,
I had a quiet life.

17
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,204
A little girl's life.

18
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:27,791
I loved fries with ketchup,
Bruce Lee was my hero,

19
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,128
I was wearing Adidas shoes
and I had 2 obsessions:

20
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:35,674
Being able to shave my legs and to
become the last prophetess in the galaxy.

21
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,978
If you put a pen under your tits

22
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:50,856
and it gets stuck then you're
in deep shit.

23
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,817
If we shake this one,

24
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,903
we can fill a whole box.

25
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:58,655
Calm down!

26
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,533
They let me see him last week.

27
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,785
He wasn't a pretty sight.

28
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:07,372
They told me that they would
release him. It's been 4 years.

29
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,916
Don't worry.

30
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:12,169
This regime won't last much longer.
Sooner or later it will go.

31
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,254
Mom! Marji kicked me!

32
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:19,968
The dragon's revenge is a bitter
dish best eaten cold!

33
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,513
The dragon is gonna get one in a minute.

34
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:33,357
"I, Marjane, future prophetess,
have decided that:

35
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,610
"One, everybody must have
a good behavior.

36
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,072
"Two, everybody must
preach good words.

37
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,200
"Three, everybody must
do one good deed.

38
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:47,788
"Four, the poor must be able to
eat one fried chicken everyday.

39
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,208
"Five, no old woman will
suffer ever again."

40
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,585
Marji,
if it's gonna be like that,

41
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,838
I'll be your first disciple.

42
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,714
Really? Great!

43
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,843
How do you know old ladies
won't suffer anymore?

44
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,594
Simple, It'll be forbidden.

45
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,471
Of course,
I should have thought about that.

46
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,056
What's going on?

47
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:09,351
Death to the Shah!
Death to the Shah!

48
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,865
I knew it!

49
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,241
I knew it!

50
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:27,911
This is an historic moment!

51
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:36,879
He's finally gonna pay.

52
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:40,132
Yes, daughter.
Your father will be avenged.

53
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,759
The Shah will meet his
buddies in Washington.

54
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,929
As for myself,
I think I love the Shah.

55
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,683
He's been chosen by God.

56
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,603
Yes! Absolutely!

57
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:56,732
God himself told me,
And the teacher too.

58
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,693
The Shah wasn't chosen by God.

59
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:00,944
Lies! The teacher says...

60
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,696
Shh...

61
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,366
That's what they say.

62
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,328
I'll tell you how it happened.

63
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:13,665
Truth is that 50 years ago,
the Shah's father, an officer,

64
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,502
wanted to overthrow the
Qadjar emperor.

65
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,922
I'll do like Ataturk!
I'll modernise the country.

66
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,798
I'll create a republic!

67
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,843
But the English heard about it.

68
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,722
Hello! Why do you want
to create a republic?

69
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,225
When you could be emperor!

70
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,018
Me? Emperor?

71
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:36,813
Of course!
It's better than president.

72
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,107
You'll have full powers.

73
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,068
A country like yours

74
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:44,655
needs a strong man like you
to rule it.

75
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,491
Hmm... It's quite true.

76
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,661
And also... you know that
the clergy

77
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,829
is against the republic.

78
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,541
Between us, he's right.

79
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,501
What must I do?

80
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,295
Nothing. You give us the oil.

81
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,590
We'll take care of the rest.

82
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:11,557
Now, I am the king!
Everything that belong to you is mine.

83
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,433
He was an asshole!

84
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,853
- Oh!
- Yes and no.

85
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:19,189
He was a dictator,
but he did modernise Iran.

86
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:22,734
He loved his country,
unlike his son, his successor.

87
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:27,197
I am the king now!
I am the light of the Aryans!

88
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:31,410
I'll make this country
the most modern of all time!

89
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,204
Our people will shine again!

90
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:38,292
Yes, the Shah's father
has been very hard.

91
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,294
He put your grandpa in prison.

92
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,546
But his son was ten times worse.

93
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,298
Grandpa has been in prison?

94
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,592
Yes! He was a member of
the royal family.

95
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,096
He was a Qadjar prince. The Shah's
father took everything from him.

96
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:54,474
He went to prison mainly because
he was a communist.

97
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:04,651
My grandpa was a Qadjar prince
and also a communist!

98
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:13,262
My god! You're still alive.
I was worried.

99
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,223
- They shot on people!
- It was hot.

100
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:19,852
We escaped but we got caught later.

101
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,604
Those sons of bitches
took my films.

102
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:25,482
- We were at the police station.
- Marji was overexcited.

103
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:29,319
She was a pain in the neck with the
proletarians, the class struggle

104
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,655
and this bearded man,
"Che Guevero."

105
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:34,741
The guy who was killed
wasn't even 20 years old.

106
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,201
What is this country?

107
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:40,372
- It's one hell of a mess, daughter.
- Death to the Shah!

108
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:41,665
Here it goes again!

109
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:45,002
Death to the Shah!
Death to the Shah!

110
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:45,919
Marji!

111
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:47,838
Go to bed now!

112
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:53,302
Death to the Shah!
Death to the Shah!

113
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,013
I understand your revolt.

114
00:09:56,221 --> 00:10:00,309
We'll try to walk together
towards democracy.

115
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,187
We'll build the future together.

116
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:27,419
Siamak!

117
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,505
- They released you?
- Hello, Ebi.

118
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,007
It's Siamak!
He's back.

119
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:34,301
Hello, Tadji.

120
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,929
We're so happy to see you alive!

121
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,597
Come in!

122
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,016
Don't stay in front of the door.

123
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,355
But it's Marjane!
You've grown!

124
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:50,526
You were still a baby
when I was arrested.

125
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,861
And now you're a young lady.

126
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:56,907
Who is this guy?

127
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,992
My father. He was in prison.

128
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:01,036
He's a hero.

129
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:05,332
Those scientists knew the
human body very well.

130
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,252
They knew how to hit
where it hurts.

131
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:12,965
I've been lashed with
large electric wire cables.

132
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,301
My foot doesn't look
like a foot anymore.

133
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:21,306
Why? Because there are nerves going
straight to the brain under the feet.

134
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,892
It's an indescribable pain.

135
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:27,312
Our torturers had been
trained by the CIA.

136
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:32,109
They were at the
forefront of torture.

137
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,987
What about Hamid?
What happened to him?

138
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,865
Hamid has been murdered.

139
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:41,994
As a member of the guerilla,
it was hell for him.

140
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,079
He had some cyanide with him.

141
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:47,082
But unfortunately,
he couldn't use it.

142
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,668
So he endured the worst tortures.

143
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,756
The one who loses will be
tortured to the death.

144
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,384
- Cool!
- What kind of torture?

145
00:11:57,593 --> 00:12:00,971
He will be lashed with
a big cable on the head!

146
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,227
But first, he'll have to put
that in his mouth.

147
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:08,812
And chew three times.

148
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:11,773
Yeah!

149
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,818
Look, it's Ramine!

150
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:18,822
Farzad told me that his father was a
member of the Shah's secret service.

151
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:23,327
His father killed a million of
people with his own hands!

152
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,703
A million!?

153
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,330
Absolutely.

154
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:30,584
We'll give Ramine a lesson
in their name.

155
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:39,218
Yeah! We'll gouge his eyes out!

156
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,481
Marjane!

157
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:53,982
What are you doing?

158
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:57,819
- Marji found some nails.
- We're gonna smash Ramine's face.

159
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:01,490
Would you like it if
I nailed you by the ears?

160
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:07,120
Go back home, get into your room
and stay there.

161
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,347
Marjane, what's happening to you?

162
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,392
It's not a behavior worthy
of a prophetess.

163
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,979
But God,
Ramine's father killed people!

164
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:36,108
Marjane, this poor Ramine
must not bear the burden

165
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,068
of his father's mistakes.

166
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:42,531
Bad guys will pay sooner or later.
Have faith in my justice.

167
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:47,327
Your duty is to forgive,
not to make justice.

168
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:52,916
Ramine?

169
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,209
What do you want?

170
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:58,255
Listen, your father is a murderer,
but it's not your fault.

171
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,673
And so I forgive you.

172
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,970
He killed communists,
and communists are the devil!

173
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,477
The country was euphoric

174
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:14,521
during the months following
the Shah's departure.

175
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,650
Everybody had been a revolutionary
and had fought the Shah.

176
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,944
The wine stain on our neighbour's face

177
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:24,198
had changed into a war wound.

178
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:27,159
Our teacher, admirer of the shah,

179
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:31,330
ordered us to tear off all the
pictures of the royal family.

180
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:35,292
Political meetings were increasing
and yesterday's enemies

181
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:38,337
had become heroes of the nation.

182
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:42,549
It's in this climate that, one night,
uncle Anouche appeared in my life.

183
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:47,429
From now on, everything will be better.
Nothing will stop the people.

184
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:51,767
We'll finally have a free
and fair society.

185
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:55,229
Proletariat will rule
as Lenin predicted.

186
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:56,230
Uncle Anouche?

187
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,273
How long did you stay in prison?

188
00:14:58,482 --> 00:14:59,483
Nine years.

189
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,318
Longer tha Laly's father?

190
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:03,362
How old are you?
Are you a communist?

191
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,823
Marji, let your uncle digest!

192
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:08,742
She wants to know everything.

193
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:11,203
It's a good thing to be curious.

194
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,830
Have you digested?

195
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:13,956
Go to bed!

196
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,415
But!

197
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,794
Put your pajamas on and I'll come.

198
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:22,256
Did you see?
They're preparing the elections.

199
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:25,259
People will want
to keep their freedom

200
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,261
after this dictatorship.

201
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:30,264
It will never be worse
than under the Shah.

202
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:32,599
I'm ready!

203
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:35,644
You'll see,
she'll eat your brain.

204
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:37,896
I'm ready!!

205
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:40,357
I'll start with the beginning.

206
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:43,694
I was 18 years old when
my uncle and his friends

207
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:47,197
declared the independence of
Azerbaidjan's Iranian province.

208
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:48,574
Wow!

209
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:53,370
Fereydoun appointed himself as
minister of Justice of this republic.

210
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,124
Justice is the basis of democracy.

211
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:00,502
Men must be equal
in front of the law.

212
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:03,380
I became his secretary.

213
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:07,634
It's just a beginning.
We'll free Iran from dictatorship.

214
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:10,262
Province by province,
city by city.

215
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,889
I'm sure of it!

216
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:16,310
It wasn't easy for me because
my father was loyal to the Shah.

217
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,148
My son is a traitor!
Go and meet my stupid brother!

218
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:24,818
You'll all be shot!
Shot!

219
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:29,239
My father couldn't have been
more right. One morning...

220
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:31,074
My God! Fereydoun!

221
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:33,660
I had to escape.
I had no choice.

222
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:36,955
While my uncle was facing
his destiny alone...

223
00:16:57,726 --> 00:17:01,021
I walked for days in the storm.

224
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,399
I was hungry, I was cold,
but I kept going.

225
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,988
I crossed Alborz mountains
to take refuge at my parents home,

226
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:11,823
in Astara.

227
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:16,119
Who dares bother me at this hour?

228
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:18,580
My God, Anouche!
My God!

229
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:20,499
It's our son, he's almost dead.

230
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,000
My dear son!

231
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,254
My son...

232
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:28,340
My dear son, forgive me!

233
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:31,552
I couldn't stay, I was wanted.

234
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,554
I had to go into exile.

235
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:57,578
I swam across the Aras river
and I arrived in USSR.

236
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:01,582
What did you do then?

237
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,458
I went to Leningrad.

238
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:07,462
Then to Moscow, I got my doctorate
in Marxism-Leninism.

239
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,882
But I was missing my family.

240
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:14,887
I tried to come back by train
with forged identity papers
but it didn't work.

241
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,973
- They arrested me.
- Then you went to prison?

242
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:20,267
Yes. You know...

243
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:22,769
It's important that you know.

244
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:26,148
The memory of the family
must not be forgotten.

245
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:29,818
Even if it's hard,
even if you don't understand everything.

246
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:33,864
Don't worry, uncle Anouche.
I'll never forget.

247
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,741
Were you married in Russia?

248
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,743
It's late. You must sleep.

249
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:40,871
Here, it's for you.

250
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,624
I made it in prison.

251
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,001
It's made of breadcrumbs.

252
00:18:57,638 --> 00:19:01,767
99,99% of the people
voted democratically

253
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,977
for the islamic republic.

254
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:08,190
It's normal. Each revolution
has its transition period.

255
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:10,400
Half the country is illiterate.

256
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:15,489
Only nationalism or religious
ethics rally people.

257
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:20,077
Mina left the country.
She thinks it's too dangerous.

258
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:25,207
We found Mohsen drowned
in the bath tube.

259
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,794
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

260
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:33,590
Siamak and his family left.
Those bastards killed his sister.

261
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,219
Maybe we should leave too.

262
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:40,889
You could be a cleaning lady
and me, a taxi driver.

263
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:44,601
We'll get rid of the
antirevolutionaries.

264
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:48,272
Between them and us, there's only
one law, the law of blood.

265
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,077
- Marji?
- Yes?

266
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:06,248
They arrested Anouche.

267
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:07,708
I know.

268
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,214
- Daddy!
- It will be all right, honey.

269
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:17,050
Do you want to do
something for him?

270
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:21,180
Anouche can have one visitor only.
You're the one he wants to see.

271
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:24,933
I'll go.

272
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:40,824
Ten minutes.

273
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,124
What a nice dress!

274
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,877
What a nice little girl!

275
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:01,261
Your visit honours me.

276
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:07,768
You're the little girl
I wish I would have had.

277
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:13,106
But you'll see, one day,
proletariat will rule

278
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:14,274
Here.

279
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:17,569
I made another swan with
breadcrumbs for you.

280
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:19,905
It's the first one's uncle.

281
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:27,246
Star of my life.

282
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:50,853
What's up my child?
Don't be sad.

283
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:54,773
Shut the fuck up!
They killed him and you did nothing!

284
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:56,859
I've nothing to do with it...

285
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:59,278
Shut up!
I don't want to see you again!

286
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,572
Go away! Go away!

287
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:03,907
Go away!!!

288
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:29,516
One year after the revolution,
Iraq attacked Iran.

289
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:33,103
Saddam took advantage of the
country's weakness to strike.

290
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:37,900
The revolution and the army
massive cleansings had weakened us.

291
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:40,861
In the name of the fight
against the foreign enemy,

292
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:43,363
the state wiped out
the enemy inland,

293
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:46,325
the old opponents to
the Shah's government.

294
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:50,454
Arrests and executions increased.

295
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:52,748
Everybody was scared.

296
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:57,336
The new government established
even more repressive laws.

297
00:22:57,544 --> 00:23:01,924
Within two years,
our everyday life changed.

298
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:03,592
And so did we.

299
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,053
Come on!

300
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,472
On the heart for our martyrs!

301
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,432
Sons and daughters of Iran,

302
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:13,477
war killed our best children.

303
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:17,022
Truth will soon arise
from their blood.

304
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:18,857
Who did they die for?

305
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,276
It's for us.

306
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:23,195
It's for us!

307
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:33,455
Hey! Martyr!

308
00:23:33,664 --> 00:23:35,833
Martyr! Martyr!

309
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,417
Finish me off!

310
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:39,419
Satrapi, what are you doing?

311
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:41,922
I'm suffering, isn't it obvious?

312
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,007
Go to the class immediately!

313
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:52,558
The veil is synonymous of freedom.
A worthy woman must cover herself

314
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:57,020
from the eyes of men.
The one revealing herself is a sinner.

315
00:23:57,229 --> 00:24:00,482
- She'll burn in hell.
- Hey! Did you see that?

316
00:24:00,691 --> 00:24:02,901
- Wow!
- Our soldiers are dying

317
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,820
for our country...
- Hey!

318
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:07,114
Look!

319
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:10,242
Pfff! Abba,
it's for the simple minded!

320
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,586
Go outside in close order!
Come on!

321
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:35,017
Mom, what do we eat?

322
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:37,144
What about some chili?

323
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:39,229
Yes, so we can fart!

324
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:42,357
Give me that!

325
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:45,152
- I saw it first!
- Yeah right, bitch!

326
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,195
Stop!

327
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:49,114
That's how it is as soon
as a shop is empty!

328
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:51,492
Each must take according
to their needs.

329
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:53,744
What business is it of yours?

330
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:54,953
Shut up!

331
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:08,759
Put your scarf back on, sister.

332
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:12,346
Hey! I'm talking to you!

333
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,515
Don't get too familiar.

334
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:17,643
Show some respect.

335
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:18,852
Respect?

336
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:20,604
Women like you,

337
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:22,981
I fuck them against the wall!

338
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:23,941
Get in!

339
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:44,002
Mom, are you all right?

340
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:46,547
Yes, darling.
I'm fine.

341
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:50,300
Are you moving or what?

342
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:52,970
Shut the fuck up!

343
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:45,582
Mom, give me 50 tomans!

344
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:47,584
What for?

345
00:27:47,793 --> 00:27:50,045
To buy a tape.

346
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:52,422
What about your Bee Gees tapes?

347
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:54,424
The Bee Gees suck!

348
00:27:59,388 --> 00:28:02,140
Stevie Wonder.
Julio Iglesias.

349
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:03,809
Pink Floyd.

350
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:05,269
"Jichael Mackson."

351
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:08,313
Lipstick, nail polish, playing cards.

352
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:09,940
Iron Maiden.

353
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:12,568
- How much?
- 100.

354
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:13,902
- 50.
- 60.

355
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:15,404
- 50.
- 60.

356
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:16,655
- 50.
- 50.

357
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:22,536
What the hell is this outfit?

358
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:24,079
Punk shoes!

359
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:25,455
What punk shoes?

360
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:26,373
Those.

361
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:27,749
They're sneakers.

362
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:29,209
It's punk.

363
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:31,879
I play basketball at school.

364
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:33,463
And this jacket?

365
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:34,798
And that?

366
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:36,133
Michael Jackson!

367
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:38,135
A symbol of decadence!

368
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:41,221
Not at all, madam.
It's... It's...

369
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,473
- Malcolm X.
- Are you kidding me?

370
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:45,601
Lower your scarf, you little whore!

371
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:49,104
- Follow us to the committee.
- Sorry, madam.

372
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:53,150
My mother is dead. My evil
mother-in-law is taking care of me.

373
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:58,155
She'll kill if I don't go back home.
She'll burn me with the iron.

374
00:28:58,363 --> 00:29:02,367
She'll force my father to
put me in an orphanage.

375
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:05,871
Have mercy!
Please, madam. Mercy...

376
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,998
Mercy. Have mercy, madam...

377
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:13,253
Phew!

378
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:43,283
Our soldiers bravery has paid off.

379
00:29:43,492 --> 00:29:48,580
Tonight, our army destroyed 63 tanks
and 26 Iraqi fighters.

380
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:52,042
The blood of our martyrs is
irrigating our sacred land.

381
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:55,003
Deserts of despair
will blossom from it.

382
00:29:55,212 --> 00:30:00,300
Dying as a martyr is like injecting
blood in the veins of society.

383
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:14,815
Are you all right, Mrs Nassrine?

384
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:18,902
No, I'm not.
They gave that to my son at school.

385
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:21,822
They told them that if they
died in combat

386
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,992
they would go to
heaven with this plastic key!

387
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,202
They've been told that in heaven,

388
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:30,998
there's plenty of food and women...

389
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:32,082
Women?!

390
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:36,420
Well, yes...
He's 14 yers old, he's interested.

391
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:38,213
I suffered a lot.

392
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:40,966
I raised my 5 children
with my tears.

393
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:44,595
Now they want to take my elder
son for this key.

394
00:30:44,803 --> 00:30:47,347
I've always been
faithful to religion.

395
00:30:47,556 --> 00:30:50,434
I prayed, wore a veil and obeyed.

396
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:54,521
If that's how things are then
I don't want to believe in anything.

397
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,731
It's me!

398
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:57,274
They arrested the Rochanis.

399
00:30:57,482 --> 00:31:00,694
They found some alcohol
at their home.

400
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:03,405
Who are you covering yourself for?

401
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:06,658
For mister.

402
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:09,661
That's how we've been raised.

403
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:12,164
Don't worry.

404
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:14,082
I'll talk to your son.

405
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:16,543
Thanks to my parents,

406
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:19,796
Mrs Nassrine's son didn't
go to the front line.

407
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:23,967
Between the fear of the bombings,
the government's repression,

408
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:28,472
and the spying of the neighbours,
life was taking its course.

409
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:37,856
To make things bearable,

410
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:42,110
people were partying in secret.

411
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:45,823
People were getting drunk at
the parties. Alcohol was forbidden,

412
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:48,534
so my uncle was providing
the family with wine.

413
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:53,747
He has installed a wine production
laboratory in his cellar.

414
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:57,251
Mrs Nassrine,
my uncle's cleaning lady

415
00:31:57,459 --> 00:31:58,877
helped pressing the grapes.

416
00:31:59,086 --> 00:32:00,879
May God forgive me!

417
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:04,633
Going to these
parties was dangerous

418
00:32:04,842 --> 00:32:08,220
but it was our only
little moment of freedom.

419
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:14,226
Come on! Get out!

420
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:16,645
Identity papers,
driving licence.

421
00:32:17,062 --> 00:32:18,605
Ok, ok.

422
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:20,148
Come closer.

423
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:22,526
Blow.
You drank.

424
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:23,527
No.

425
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:25,737
You're lying, you dirty westerner!

426
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:26,822
That's enough!

427
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,992
How dare you talk to me like that?

428
00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:32,161
Shut up!

429
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:33,495
Listen.

430
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:35,831
I could be your mother.

431
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:38,458
How old are you?
My daughter is 13.

432
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:43,463
You'd be in hell without your wife.

433
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:45,007
Thank you!

434
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:46,925
Get in! We're going to your place

435
00:32:47,134 --> 00:32:49,052
to check if there are some bottles.

436
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:52,639
Grandma, Marji, you go first.

437
00:32:52,848 --> 00:32:54,933
Empty all the bottles.

438
00:32:55,142 --> 00:32:57,477
- But how?
- Don't worry, my daughter.

439
00:32:57,686 --> 00:32:59,605
I was used to it with your father.

440
00:32:59,813 --> 00:33:02,232
We had to hide the flyers.

441
00:33:03,442 --> 00:33:06,528
Listen, the neighbour on the same
floor is a bit old.

442
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:09,156
He has a heart condition.
He could die

443
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:12,493
if we make too much noise.
Can we come to an agreement?

444
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:15,871
Hey! Where are you going?

445
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:20,792
I'm diabetic, son.
I have to drink some syrup.

446
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:23,337
Diabetic?
Like my mother.

447
00:33:23,545 --> 00:33:24,546
Go ahead then.

448
00:33:45,234 --> 00:33:47,110
Where are the others?

449
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:51,657
Their arrogance isn't ideological.
A few bank notes were enough.

450
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,202
Tell me,
did you throw everything away?

451
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:57,037
Well, yes!

452
00:33:57,246 --> 00:33:58,705
Shit!

453
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:11,093
It's his heart again.

454
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:14,012
They wanted to stop the communists.

455
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:17,891
They threw a grenade.
Taher couldn't endure it.

456
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,894
He was lying on the ground
when I arrived.

457
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:22,604
Everything will be all right.

458
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:24,523
No, it won't.

459
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:27,651
He must have an
open-heart operation.

460
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,529
They can't afford it here.

461
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:33,323
He must be sent to England.

462
00:34:33,532 --> 00:34:37,035
I went to see the administrative
director of the hospital.

463
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:40,122
It's unbelievable.
Do you know who he was?

464
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,875
My old window cleaner.

465
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:47,254
I pretended not to recognise
this moron.

466
00:34:47,462 --> 00:34:51,592
Only people who are seriously ill
can leave the country.

467
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,052
My husband had three heart attacks.

468
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:56,972
He must be operated or he'll die.

469
00:34:57,181 --> 00:34:59,016
We'll do our best.

470
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:03,145
If God wants it, he'll get better.
Everything depends on God.

471
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:07,399
I need your authorization
for his passport.

472
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:09,568
If God wants it.

473
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:12,196
This asshole grew a beard
and wears a suit.

474
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:14,907
And now he's a director!

475
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:17,034
My husband's fate depends on

476
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:18,744
a window cleaner!

477
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:21,788
He doesn't even look women in
the eyes anymore.

478
00:35:21,997 --> 00:35:23,081
Fucking asshole!

479
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:27,794
I know someone who
makes passports.

480
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:29,713
Calm down.
It'll be all right.

481
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:31,882
Wait!
I'm coming with you.

482
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:38,222
Where did I put it?

483
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,723
Ha! Here it is!

484
00:35:39,932 --> 00:35:40,849
Look at that.

485
00:35:41,058 --> 00:35:42,267
It looks like a real one.

486
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:46,188
A month work,
just for this stamp!

487
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:47,981
What's your name?

488
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,192
How much time do you need?

489
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:54,530
Passports are very much in demand.

490
00:35:54,738 --> 00:35:57,574
I make a living with that.
They closed my publishing business.

491
00:35:57,783 --> 00:36:01,203
It takes 15 days,
but I'll do it in a week.

492
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:03,163
Great. Be quick.

493
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:08,710
It's Niloufar.

494
00:36:08,919 --> 00:36:10,087
This is Ebi,

495
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:13,257
Anouche's brother,
I talked to you about him.

496
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:14,341
Hello.

497
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,176
She is a communist too.

498
00:36:16,385 --> 00:36:20,013
Her brother was my messenger.
I'm hiding her in my cellar.

499
00:36:20,222 --> 00:36:22,975
It's the only place
where she's safe.

500
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:41,493
Is he stupid or what?

501
00:36:41,702 --> 00:36:43,704
He's gonna get crushed!

502
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:46,623
Here! That's what I said!

503
00:36:52,671 --> 00:36:53,797
Don't look.

504
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:56,383
- It's too ugly.
- Grandma, stop it!

505
00:36:57,801 --> 00:37:02,556
What of piece of shit! Apart
from cutting their stomach open

506
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:06,351
and making disgusting monsters,
those Japanese can't do anything.

507
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:15,569
Grandma, do you think that
uncle Taher is gonna die?

508
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:17,821
- Of course.
- Really? You think so?

509
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:21,867
If he doesn't find any passport
to leave, he won't make it.

510
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:24,703
He shouldn't have smoked so much.

511
00:37:24,912 --> 00:37:27,623
What a load of crap!
His heart is sick

512
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:31,752
because his children are far away.

513
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,839
One portion of hot beans please.

514
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:39,051
Children always leave
sooner or later.

515
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:43,514
But being separated from your 13 years
old children because of war is absurd!

516
00:37:43,722 --> 00:37:45,766
It can break anyone's heart.

517
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:51,063
I'd be dead already if I were him.

518
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,149
May God exterminate those barbarians.

519
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:56,109
May God hear you.

520
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:10,249
Hello? Ha, Khosrow, is that you?

521
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:11,959
So, what's up?

522
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:15,337
They arrested Niloufar.
I have to escape!

523
00:38:15,546 --> 00:38:16,755
Hello?

524
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:17,965
Khosrow?

525
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:19,383
Hello?

526
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:31,228
Niloufar was executed.

527
00:38:33,522 --> 00:38:37,943
Khosrow escape by the mountains
in Turkey and went to Sweden.

528
00:38:42,364 --> 00:38:46,743
Uncle Taher was buried
three weeks after these events.

529
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:51,123
The war intensified.

530
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:58,088
Let me pass!

531
00:38:58,297 --> 00:38:59,590
Sorry!

532
00:38:59,798 --> 00:39:01,133
Let me pass!

533
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:02,384
Stop!

534
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:04,261
I live over there!

535
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,013
Go.

536
00:39:27,284 --> 00:39:29,495
- Marji!
- Mom!

537
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:32,164
Are you all right?

538
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:34,208
Yes, honey.
I'm fine.

539
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:36,293
Where did the missile go?

540
00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:39,630
It hit the Baba Levys.

541
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:42,090
What? The Baba Levys?

542
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:07,241
Thanks to the government, we don't
have any political prisoners left.

543
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:08,575
Madam?

544
00:40:08,784 --> 00:40:11,328
We finally earned our freedom.

545
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:13,413
- Madam?
- What?

546
00:40:13,622 --> 00:40:17,960
It's the new government that ordered
the execution of my uncle.

547
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:23,298
From 3000 prisoners during the Shah,
we now have 300000 with you.

548
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:25,801
How dare you lie?

549
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:28,178
Stop it!

550
00:40:37,563 --> 00:40:38,355
Who was it?

551
00:40:38,564 --> 00:40:42,109
The school. Marji put the religion
teacher to her place.

552
00:40:42,317 --> 00:40:43,819
- Again?
- Yes.

553
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:45,529
She takes after her uncle.

554
00:40:45,737 --> 00:40:49,283
Do you want her to end like
her uncle, executed?

555
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:53,412
Do you know what they do to
young women like Niloufar?

556
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,831
The law forbids to kill a virgin.

557
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:58,083
She was forced to marry a guard.

558
00:40:58,292 --> 00:41:00,043
Then he took her virginity before
executing her!

559
00:41:00,252 --> 00:41:02,004
Do you understand?

560
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:06,842
If someone touches one of her
hair, I'll kill him!

561
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:11,221
A little later, they decided
to send me abroad.

562
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:14,766
Since I had studied at
the French school in Teheran,

563
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:19,771
I'd go to the French school in Vienna.
My father managed to get me a visa.

564
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,609
My mother's best friend
was supposed to take me in.

565
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:27,613
The day before my departure,
grandma came to sleep at home.

566
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:33,535
Every morning she would put fresh jasmine
flowers in her bra.

567
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:37,372
When she was taking it off, the
flowers would fall from her breasts.

568
00:41:37,581 --> 00:41:38,832
It was magical.

569
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:43,545
How do you manage to have
such round breasts at your age?

570
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:48,550
Everyday I put them for 10 minutes
in bowl of icy cold water.

571
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:52,346
I'll miss you.

572
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:55,557
I'll come and see you.

573
00:41:57,476 --> 00:41:58,727
Listen.

574
00:41:58,936 --> 00:42:03,565
I'm gonna give you an advice
that will always be useful.

575
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:07,194
In your life, you'll meet
a lot of assholes.

576
00:42:07,402 --> 00:42:11,740
Remember that it's stupidity
that pushes them to be evil.

577
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:14,785
It will prevent you from
answering to their nastiness.

578
00:42:14,993 --> 00:42:18,956
Because there's nothing worse
than bitterness and vengeance.

579
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:23,168
Always remain worthy and
true to yourself.

580
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:31,385
You'll see,
everything will be all right.

581
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:34,429
No tears.
Think about your future.

582
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:36,265
Europe is opening to you.

583
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:39,601
When you'll arrive in Vienna,
eat a sachertorte.

584
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:43,480
It's a delicious chocolate cake.
We'll come to see you.

585
00:42:43,689 --> 00:42:45,816
You're a grown up.
No tears!

586
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,068
- Daddy...
- Enough.

587
00:42:48,277 --> 00:42:49,528
You must leave.

588
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:53,574
Never forget who you are
and where you come from.

589
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:55,242
My daughter.

590
00:42:56,702 --> 00:42:58,579
- Mom!
- My little Marji.

591
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:04,937
Europe opened itself to me,
but not like I imagined.

592
00:44:05,145 --> 00:44:07,856
After a few days at
my mother's friend home,

593
00:44:08,065 --> 00:44:12,361
she decided that their apartment
was too small to accomodate me.

594
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:16,365
She found me a convent
where I would be very well looked after

595
00:44:17,324 --> 00:44:18,575
according to her.

596
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:36,510
What?

597
00:44:36,593 --> 00:44:37,344
Was?

598
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:38,178
Huh?

599
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:16,550
I found shelves of products

600
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:20,596
that no longer existed
in my country.

601
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:24,558
For a while,

602
00:45:24,766 --> 00:45:27,936
going to the supermarket
was my favorite pastime...

603
00:45:28,145 --> 00:45:29,813
favorite pastime...

604
00:45:30,022 --> 00:45:32,191
favorite pastime...

605
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:35,611
Anyway! It was urgent that
I made some new friends.

606
00:45:41,033 --> 00:45:44,369
Fortunately, at the French school,
I could understand everyone

607
00:45:44,578 --> 00:45:46,288
and be understood.

608
00:45:46,747 --> 00:45:47,748
Do you have a smoke?

609
00:45:50,501 --> 00:45:53,754
Quickly, the school's marginals
were interested in me.

610
00:45:53,962 --> 00:45:57,299
There was Momo, Thierry,
Olivier and Eve.

611
00:45:57,508 --> 00:46:00,302
My nationality and my history
were fascinating them.

612
00:46:00,511 --> 00:46:02,888
You saw a revolution and a war?

613
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:05,599
- Yeah.
- Did you see many dead people?

614
00:46:05,807 --> 00:46:07,267
Err... A few.

615
00:46:07,476 --> 00:46:08,810
Wow!

616
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:10,395
Terrific.

617
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:17,861
I was soon a member of the band.

618
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:20,531
With Momo,
I discovered nonchalance,

619
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:24,952
a forced nihilism concept and
the Vienna's alternative life.

620
00:46:39,383 --> 00:46:42,469
I admit that at the beginning
it was a little difficult.

621
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:45,430
And after all, why not?

622
00:46:48,809 --> 00:46:51,812
I was trying to convince myself
that I had found my place.

623
00:46:52,729 --> 00:46:54,898
But I remained different.

624
00:46:55,107 --> 00:46:58,110
Holidays were sure
to remind me of it.

625
00:46:58,694 --> 00:47:02,906
Shit, Christmas again!
I'll have to see my whole family.

626
00:47:03,115 --> 00:47:06,285
All this because of
an American invention.

627
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:08,829
Santa Claus is in red and white because

628
00:47:09,037 --> 00:47:11,540
it was a mascot for Coca-Cola.

629
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:14,418
I'll be bored to death in Monte-Carlo.

630
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:16,461
Monte-Carlo is still all right.

631
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:19,923
Me, I'm gonna see my father in Brazil,
what a load of crap!

632
00:47:20,132 --> 00:47:21,842
It's at least a 13 hours flight!

633
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:24,970
Holidays are scraps left to the pleb.

634
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:28,974
If the anarchists had won,
we wouldn't work anymore.

635
00:47:29,183 --> 00:47:31,351
Is everything all right, my dear?

636
00:47:31,894 --> 00:47:34,605
Good.
What are you doing for Christmas?

637
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:37,816
So?

638
00:47:38,025 --> 00:47:41,320
She'll be with some friends
from shool. Be careful.

639
00:47:41,528 --> 00:47:43,280
Is there anything you need?

640
00:47:44,156 --> 00:47:46,867
You're right, enjoy it.
Kisses.

641
00:47:47,075 --> 00:47:49,369
Eat some fruits and vegetables.

642
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:27,366
Is this a common behavior?

643
00:48:27,574 --> 00:48:28,617
What?

644
00:48:28,826 --> 00:48:31,662
- The way you're eating?
- We can eat in front of the TV.

645
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:34,832
Maybe, but not in a saucepan.

646
00:48:35,624 --> 00:48:39,127
So it's true,
Iranians have no education.

647
00:48:39,795 --> 00:48:43,048
Is it true that you were
all prostitutes before?

648
00:48:43,257 --> 00:48:44,174
Oh!

649
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:48,011
It was the beginning of
a series of moves.

650
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,305
I was flying from
apartment to apartment.

651
00:48:50,514 --> 00:48:53,100
First Eve and her mother took me in.

652
00:48:53,308 --> 00:48:55,769
After that I was living
with 8 homosexuals.

653
00:48:55,978 --> 00:48:59,606
Next, I was living in a maid room
then at some friends home,

654
00:48:59,815 --> 00:49:01,859
and at some friends of
some friends home,

655
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:05,696
to finally end in
Frau Doktor Schloss villa.

656
00:49:05,988 --> 00:49:08,824
She was a retired
philosophy teacher.

657
00:49:09,032 --> 00:49:11,243
To sum up, she was nuts.

658
00:49:14,872 --> 00:49:17,374
The rent is 2000 schillings a month.

659
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:21,837
- You like dogs, don't you?
- Yes, yes. I love them.

660
00:49:23,297 --> 00:49:25,090
Yuki adopted you.

661
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:27,676
Dogs have a sixth sense.

662
00:49:27,885 --> 00:49:30,262
They recognise good people.

663
00:49:33,932 --> 00:49:37,561
I decided to become integrated
during the next year.

664
00:49:37,769 --> 00:49:41,857
But sometimes, western culture
remained a mistery.

665
00:49:42,065 --> 00:49:43,317
Jawoll! Jawoll!

666
00:49:43,525 --> 00:49:45,277
I had to improve my knowledge.

667
00:49:45,486 --> 00:49:48,280
From Sartre to Bakounin,
from Zweig to Freud...

668
00:49:48,489 --> 00:49:50,532
I read everything I could.

669
00:49:50,741 --> 00:49:54,995
But I understood that some things
would be beyond me forever.

670
00:50:02,628 --> 00:50:06,131
Did you see?
That fat pig Waldheim has been elected.

671
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,800
I want to puke!

672
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:11,553
It can't last any longer.
We must demonstrate!

673
00:50:11,762 --> 00:50:13,722
All of this is hot air.

674
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:15,015
Life is empty.

675
00:50:15,224 --> 00:50:17,267
When man realises it,

676
00:50:17,476 --> 00:50:20,312
he creates games with rulers and...

677
00:50:20,521 --> 00:50:23,440
Bullshit!
Life isn't absurd!

678
00:50:23,649 --> 00:50:26,485
People give their life for freedom!

679
00:50:27,569 --> 00:50:29,780
My uncle didn't die for fun.

680
00:50:30,197 --> 00:50:31,281
Fucking asshole!

681
00:50:35,244 --> 00:50:37,371
My feeling of disarray was immense.

682
00:50:38,914 --> 00:50:43,794
I was safe here while my loved ones
were enduring the war.

683
00:50:44,878 --> 00:50:48,590
I couldn't let go of this
feeling of guilt.

684
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:54,429
I wanted to live like
a girl of my age.

685
00:50:55,347 --> 00:50:57,516
Time for changes was appoaching.

686
00:50:57,724 --> 00:51:00,686
Within a few months,
I became a young woman.

687
00:51:00,894 --> 00:51:03,981
It was a time of endlessly
repeating ugliness.

688
00:51:04,189 --> 00:51:08,110
First, I grew 18 cm.
Then my face changed.

689
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:12,573
My face got longer, my right eye
got bigger, followed by my chin.

690
00:51:12,781 --> 00:51:16,285
My right hand became huge,
then it was my left foot.

691
00:51:17,411 --> 00:51:20,539
My nose got three time bigger.
My breast grew.

692
00:51:21,331 --> 00:51:25,043
My buttocks appeared,
thus restoring my centre of gravity.

693
00:51:25,252 --> 00:51:28,839
And to top it all, a huge mole
appeared on my nose.

694
00:51:39,474 --> 00:51:43,645
You see, Yuki? I told you.
She's a whore!

695
00:51:47,566 --> 00:51:49,359
What shitty music!

696
00:51:49,568 --> 00:51:52,362
There are only assholes here.

697
00:51:52,571 --> 00:51:56,950
Bakounin wanted the socialist
resolutions to be voted.

698
00:51:57,159 --> 00:51:58,911
We wouldn't be where we are.

699
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,037
Really?

700
00:52:00,245 --> 00:52:03,165
Capitalism is eating away
our society, don't you see?

701
00:52:03,373 --> 00:52:07,836
Yeah, of course. Well...
Where are you from... Marie-Jeanne?

702
00:52:08,045 --> 00:52:11,381
Yeah... I'm from...
I'm French.

703
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:15,761
Ha? I wouldn't have guessed.
Last year I was in Paris.

704
00:52:15,969 --> 00:52:18,055
Excuse me, I must go.

705
00:52:18,263 --> 00:52:20,265
Okay. Well then, bye.

706
00:52:38,325 --> 00:52:40,702
So you're French now?

707
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:42,746
Grandma, stop it.

708
00:52:42,955 --> 00:52:44,915
It was just a question.

709
00:52:45,123 --> 00:52:47,709
I didn't know you were French.

710
00:52:47,918 --> 00:52:50,587
Do you think it's easy to be Iranian?

711
00:52:50,796 --> 00:52:53,507
People look at me
as if I am a savage.

712
00:52:53,715 --> 00:52:57,761
To them, we're just screaming fanatics,
fighting each other.

713
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:00,639
Is it a reason to disown your origins?

714
00:53:04,977 --> 00:53:07,020
Remember what I told you.

715
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:10,440
Be true to yourself.

716
00:53:17,406 --> 00:53:20,576
Do you know what she told my brother?

717
00:53:20,784 --> 00:53:22,161
That she was French.

718
00:53:23,287 --> 00:53:25,205
- I'm not kidding.
- Did he believe her?

719
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:27,791
What? Did you see her face?

720
00:53:30,502 --> 00:53:33,213
- He wanted to chat her up?
- Don't be ridiculous!

721
00:53:33,422 --> 00:53:36,341
I'd kill myself if
he went out with this ugly ducking.

722
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,051
Shut the fuck up!

723
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:41,305
I'm Iranian and proud to be one!

724
00:53:44,016 --> 00:53:47,436
After 3 years in Austria
I was finally feeling good.

725
00:53:47,644 --> 00:53:51,315
Momo, Thierry, Eve and Olivier
had left school.

726
00:53:51,773 --> 00:53:53,650
I had new friends.

727
00:53:54,651 --> 00:53:59,490
There was Birgit, a 30 years old
hippie with the face of an old child.

728
00:54:00,282 --> 00:54:04,703
She had a house in the forest
where she organised "anarchist" parties.

729
00:54:04,912 --> 00:54:08,874
The State could rest easy.
Those so-called anarchist meetings

730
00:54:09,082 --> 00:54:13,170
were just a pretext to drink
beer and eat sausages.

731
00:54:14,213 --> 00:54:17,216
I met Fernando at one
of these parties.

732
00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:20,511
When I saw him, I immediately knew
that he was the man of my life.

733
00:54:50,165 --> 00:54:52,209
Marjane, are you here?

734
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:53,919
Ha!

735
00:54:54,127 --> 00:54:56,630
Last night, I finally understood,
thanks to you.

736
00:54:57,172 --> 00:54:59,758
You revealed me to myself.

737
00:55:00,467 --> 00:55:03,971
If it doesn't work with you,
it won't work with any girl.

738
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:07,266
I know it, now.
I am homosexual.

739
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:10,519
Ha! It's good to say it.

740
00:55:12,354 --> 00:55:14,189
Thank you, Marjane. Thank you.

741
00:55:15,149 --> 00:55:16,150
You're welcome.

742
00:55:18,902 --> 00:55:22,072
I swore that I wouldn't let
myself be caught at it again.

743
00:55:22,281 --> 00:55:24,241
I won't let myself
be caught at it again!

744
00:55:24,741 --> 00:55:27,452
Love is a conventional feeling!

745
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:32,040
But "Life is life",
as the other losers sang it.

746
00:55:32,249 --> 00:55:36,837
One morning in november,
Markus came into my life.

747
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:51,226
Shall I walk you back?

748
00:56:10,162 --> 00:56:12,080
I had finally found love.

749
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:15,709
Nothing was frightening me.
The future looked radiant.

750
00:56:16,293 --> 00:56:19,004
Markus was to become a great writer.

751
00:56:20,964 --> 00:56:24,760
He was reading me extracts from
his play in his room.

752
00:56:36,772 --> 00:56:38,482
We were as one.

753
00:57:00,921 --> 00:57:02,589
I bought some croissants!

754
00:57:04,508 --> 00:57:05,926
Oh!

755
00:57:06,134 --> 00:57:08,762
Wait.
It's not what you think.

756
00:57:10,806 --> 00:57:12,724
Marjane, I love you!

757
00:57:13,851 --> 00:57:16,103
I love you!

758
00:57:20,858 --> 00:57:22,734
I can't find my brooch.

759
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:25,445
It's you who stole it!

760
00:57:25,654 --> 00:57:27,447
Leave me alone.

761
00:57:27,656 --> 00:57:29,950
I shan't let it rest at that!

762
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:31,535
Bloody thief!

763
00:57:31,743 --> 00:57:33,579
Go to hell!
I hate you!

764
00:57:33,787 --> 00:57:35,956
You and your fucking dog!!!

765
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,920
Don't talk like that about my dog.
Where are you going?

766
00:57:42,713 --> 00:57:46,466
- You won't get away with it so easily.
- Fuck off!!!

767
00:57:46,675 --> 00:57:49,178
Bloody thief!
Give me my brooch back!

768
00:57:49,386 --> 00:57:52,639
I'll call the police!
Come back!

769
00:57:56,268 --> 00:58:01,148
How could I be so stupid?
I was all over him.

770
00:58:01,356 --> 00:58:03,901
I'm a stupid cunt, cunt, cunt!

771
00:58:04,109 --> 00:58:08,322
How could I fall in love with
this scumbag, this skinflint?

772
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:10,199
Shall I take you back?

773
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:13,660
I must fill it up.
Do we split 50-50?

774
00:58:15,412 --> 00:58:20,042
This asshole's breath smelled
like shit with his damned attitude!

775
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:23,629
Fuck! What a stupid cunt are you?

776
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:25,339
My eye hurts like hell!

777
00:58:25,547 --> 00:58:27,758
- Show me, my love.
- No!

778
00:58:27,966 --> 00:58:30,052
Asshole!
Writer, my ass!

779
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,804
With his shitty play!
It sucked!

780
00:58:35,682 --> 00:58:40,687
This son of a bitch had no balls. He didn't
take my defense in front of his mother.

781
00:58:45,234 --> 00:58:46,235
Ja, Mutter.

782
00:58:46,443 --> 00:58:48,278
A gutless individual, yes!

783
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:50,989
Thinking of it, it was always me
who was sent to buy weed!

784
00:58:51,198 --> 00:58:54,117
This jerk was waiting
for me in the car.

785
00:58:54,326 --> 00:58:57,371
He wouldn't have been bothered
if I had been arrested.

786
00:58:59,122 --> 00:59:01,834
What a stupid cunt I was!
A stupid cunt!

787
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:15,848
It was my first night in the street.
The first of many.

788
01:01:31,483 --> 01:01:34,862
I had lost some of my relatives
in a revolution.

789
01:01:35,654 --> 01:01:37,698
I had survived a war.

790
01:01:38,282 --> 01:01:41,743
And it's a love story that
almost got me.

791
01:01:43,495 --> 01:01:44,580
Hello?

792
01:01:47,457 --> 01:01:49,168
Waking up, are we?

793
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:53,088
Well, that was a close one!

794
01:01:53,297 --> 01:01:57,926
It's a good thing we found you.
You've had several bronchitis.

795
01:01:58,135 --> 01:02:02,222
I strictly forbid you
to smoke any cigarette.

796
01:02:02,431 --> 01:02:04,266
- Last name?
- Satrapi.

797
01:02:04,475 --> 01:02:06,477
- First name?
- Marjane.

798
01:02:07,603 --> 01:02:09,813
- Where do you live?
- In Iran.

799
01:02:10,022 --> 01:02:10,981
In Iran?

800
01:02:12,316 --> 01:02:14,067
Can I make a phone call?

801
01:02:14,902 --> 01:02:16,111
Hello?

802
01:02:16,195 --> 01:02:18,906
- Daddy?
- Marjane! Is that you?

803
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:22,534
We were worried to death.
You haven't called for 2 months!

804
01:02:22,743 --> 01:02:25,204
Daddy... Can I come back?

805
01:02:25,412 --> 01:02:28,874
- Of course.
- You won't ask me any question?

806
01:02:29,082 --> 01:02:31,084
No, I promise you.

807
01:02:31,877 --> 01:02:33,670
I'm putting you through to your mother.

808
01:02:33,879 --> 01:02:37,466
- Marjane?
- Mom, please, don't cry.

809
01:02:37,674 --> 01:02:40,552
Come back home.
We're waiting for you.

810
01:02:40,761 --> 01:02:43,388
- Mom...
- We won't ask you any question.

811
01:02:43,597 --> 01:02:44,806
It's a promise.

812
01:02:54,316 --> 01:02:56,443
Don't you have anything forbidden, Sister?

813
01:02:56,652 --> 01:03:01,657
Pork, alcohol, playing cards, music,
film, fashion, porno?

814
01:03:01,865 --> 01:03:03,367
No, sir.

815
01:03:03,826 --> 01:03:05,452
Rearrange your veil, sister.

816
01:03:06,328 --> 01:03:07,454
Yes, sir.

817
01:03:08,163 --> 01:03:09,456
You can go.

818
01:03:18,507 --> 01:03:20,217
It's Marji!

819
01:03:20,425 --> 01:03:23,262
- My daughter...
- I didn't recognize you.

820
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:25,180
- You're here.
- You've grown.

821
01:03:25,389 --> 01:03:26,473
You're here.

822
01:03:36,525 --> 01:03:40,279
I saw the Alborz mountains again.
It had been snowing.

823
01:03:40,654 --> 01:03:44,741
My father was wondering if he had
to put the snow chains on the tires.

824
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:49,288
We had breakfast together,
like before.

825
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:52,875
My mother had prepared
my favorite omelette.

826
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:56,253
Nothing had changed,
and yet, I knew that...

827
01:03:56,461 --> 01:04:00,841
nothing would be like before.
We talked about many things.

828
01:04:01,049 --> 01:04:05,053
My parents kept their word
and didn't ask me any question.

829
01:04:05,262 --> 01:04:10,350
I didn't feel very comfortable but I thought
that the nightmare was behind us.

830
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:14,563
The future might get brighter
once the war will be over.

831
01:04:14,771 --> 01:04:17,983
The war is over for sure.

832
01:04:18,192 --> 01:04:21,153
But people forgot why
there's been 8 years of war.

833
01:04:21,361 --> 01:04:23,947
Let her breathe.

834
01:04:24,156 --> 01:04:25,282
She's just arrived!

835
01:04:25,491 --> 01:04:27,493
No, no, mom.
It's all right.

836
01:04:30,662 --> 01:04:33,165
The West sold weapons
to both sides.

837
01:04:33,373 --> 01:04:37,503
We had been stupid enough
to take part in this cynical game.

838
01:04:37,711 --> 01:04:40,005
8 years of war for nothing.

839
01:04:40,464 --> 01:04:42,966
A million dead for nothing.

840
01:04:44,051 --> 01:04:46,637
The last days were horrifying.

841
01:04:47,471 --> 01:04:52,434
A month before the armistice,
Irak bombed Teheran on a daily basis.

842
01:04:52,643 --> 01:04:56,146
As if it had to be wiped
out from the map.

843
01:04:56,355 --> 01:04:58,398
Just before the ceasefire,

844
01:04:58,607 --> 01:05:03,278
the government got scared because
some opponents had fled to Iran.

845
01:05:03,862 --> 01:05:08,325
The government was afraid of the threat that
represented the thousands of political prisoners.

846
01:05:08,534 --> 01:05:12,663
So the state decided to put
an end to it the hard way.

847
01:05:12,871 --> 01:05:15,165
They proposed to the convicts

848
01:05:15,374 --> 01:05:20,254
to renounce their ideals, to promise
to be loyal to the regime

849
01:05:20,462 --> 01:05:22,923
and to serve their sentence

850
01:05:23,131 --> 01:05:25,175
or to be executed.

851
01:05:29,054 --> 01:05:32,349
Most of them were executed.

852
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:43,235
That's it.

853
01:05:43,443 --> 01:05:46,238
Now streets are
named after martyrs.

854
01:05:46,446 --> 01:05:50,117
That's all that's left to famillies.
Street names.

855
01:05:52,161 --> 01:05:54,288
When you walk in Teheran,

856
01:05:54,496 --> 01:05:57,332
it's like being in a cemetery.

857
01:06:14,516 --> 01:06:16,268
You've really grown!

858
01:06:16,477 --> 01:06:18,937
You'll soon be able to
catch God's balls.

859
01:06:19,146 --> 01:06:20,564
Grandma!

860
01:06:21,857 --> 01:06:23,775
Tell me.

861
01:06:23,984 --> 01:06:25,319
How was Vienna?

862
01:06:25,527 --> 01:06:28,530
Well, yeah...
It was different.

863
01:06:29,114 --> 01:06:30,866
Do you remember Mina?

864
01:06:31,074 --> 01:06:33,035
Of course, she's my cousin.

865
01:06:33,243 --> 01:06:35,913
She got married.
She has two kids.

866
01:06:36,955 --> 01:06:38,290
She's still as stupid as before.

867
01:06:38,499 --> 01:06:40,417
And Shila, do you remember her?

868
01:06:40,626 --> 01:06:42,252
- Yes.
- She's ugly.

869
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:46,507
She has hair on her face.
She looks like a gorilla.

870
01:06:46,715 --> 01:06:48,300
And do you remember Mojdeh?

871
01:06:48,509 --> 01:06:50,385
I remember everybody.

872
01:06:50,594 --> 01:06:53,222
She got a divorce.
He had a small dick.

873
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:57,726
Well, that's what Shahri said.
She told Mehri who told me.

874
01:06:59,144 --> 01:07:01,021
You'll see them all soon.

875
01:07:01,814 --> 01:07:02,898
Oh no!

876
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:04,274
Well, yes...

877
01:07:09,947 --> 01:07:12,825
You must be speaking German now.

878
01:07:13,033 --> 01:07:13,909
Yes, a little.

879
01:07:14,117 --> 01:07:16,703
I know how to say
"Ich liebe dich."

880
01:07:17,746 --> 01:07:20,958
Vienna reminds me of
Empress Sissi.

881
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:22,334
You saw Romy Schneider?

882
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:26,463
Marjane...
Stars are shining in the sky

883
01:07:26,672 --> 01:07:28,215
and you in my heart.

884
01:07:29,883 --> 01:07:33,470
What a nun face! It's doesn't
look like you lived in Europe.

885
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:34,680
Really?

886
01:07:34,888 --> 01:07:37,224
Talk a little!
Tell us.

887
01:07:37,432 --> 01:07:38,767
I don't know...

888
01:07:38,976 --> 01:07:41,728
How are the night clubs in Vienna?

889
01:07:41,937 --> 01:07:44,940
Well... I didn't go out much.

890
01:07:45,149 --> 01:07:47,151
- I don't like night clubs too much.
- What?!

891
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:48,944
Did you have sex?

892
01:07:49,153 --> 01:07:49,987
Well, yes.

893
01:07:50,195 --> 01:07:51,238
Is it good?

894
01:07:51,446 --> 01:07:52,281
It depends.

895
01:07:52,489 --> 01:07:55,325
What?
You had sex with several men?

896
01:07:55,534 --> 01:07:59,246
- Join a nursery school.
- Have your nose fixed.

897
01:08:18,932 --> 01:08:21,393
I can't bear it anymore!
It's 40C!

898
01:08:21,602 --> 01:08:22,936
I can't stand it any longer.

899
01:08:23,145 --> 01:08:25,063
Damn hairdresser!

900
01:08:25,272 --> 01:08:28,233
- You're not worthy of my son!
- Oh! Anahita!

901
01:08:28,442 --> 01:08:29,568
Hello!

902
01:08:31,612 --> 01:08:33,363
Marjane just went out.

903
01:08:33,572 --> 01:08:35,282
All right, I'll tell her.

904
01:08:35,491 --> 01:08:37,117
Good bye.

905
01:08:37,326 --> 01:08:41,371
Stop watching tv!
Didn't you want to try the exam?

906
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:47,878
You're ruining the
best years of your life.

907
01:08:48,086 --> 01:08:49,880
Go and meet people!

908
01:08:50,088 --> 01:08:51,924
Everybody is pissing me off.

909
01:08:52,132 --> 01:08:54,176
Out of 7 million inhabitants,

910
01:08:54,384 --> 01:08:57,262
isn't there one person who
you don't think is stupid?

911
01:08:58,931 --> 01:09:02,643
There was Kia, my childhood friend,
I wanted to see him.

912
01:09:02,851 --> 01:09:06,271
When I saw him,
I understood my grandma's words.

913
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,065
He was almost dead.

914
01:09:08,273 --> 01:09:09,817
Kia went to war.

915
01:09:10,025 --> 01:09:15,239
He lost an arm and a leg.
I spent a good time with him.

916
01:09:15,447 --> 01:09:19,701
We even laughed.
After that, I relativised my miseries.

917
01:09:20,869 --> 01:09:23,705
Yes. For him, it's his whole
life that's screwed up.

918
01:09:23,914 --> 01:09:25,457
Yet, he laughed about it.

919
01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:26,750
Hmm.

920
01:09:26,959 --> 01:09:30,087
It's the only way to bear
the unbearable.

921
01:09:31,296 --> 01:09:34,550
Whatever I tell myself,
I can't do it.

922
01:09:34,758 --> 01:09:36,134
It's still unbearable.

923
01:09:36,885 --> 01:09:40,139
What I endured lies too heavy on me,
but who can I talk to?

924
01:09:40,347 --> 01:09:42,307
- You see?
- Hmm.

925
01:09:43,225 --> 01:09:45,310
My relatives have suffered so much.

926
01:09:45,519 --> 01:09:50,065
I was a stranger in Austria
and I became one here.

927
01:09:50,274 --> 01:09:52,401
I see.
Your sickness has a name.

928
01:09:52,609 --> 01:09:55,154
It's a nervous breakdown.

929
01:09:55,362 --> 01:09:58,240
There are some effective treatments.

930
01:09:58,448 --> 01:10:01,201
I'll prescribe some medication.

931
01:10:15,841 --> 01:10:20,345
Don't you want to come with us?
Some fresh air will do you some good.

932
01:10:20,554 --> 01:10:22,931
No. I want to be alone.

933
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:25,017
Don't worry.

934
01:11:53,605 --> 01:11:56,066
So, kiddo, what are you doing here?

935
01:11:56,275 --> 01:11:58,068
Well... I'm dead.

936
01:11:58,277 --> 01:12:01,363
My child,
your time hasn't come yet.

937
01:12:01,572 --> 01:12:02,573
Oh really?

938
01:12:02,781 --> 01:12:05,409
My daughter,
you'll have to pick yourself up.

939
01:12:05,617 --> 01:12:07,494
He's right for once!

940
01:12:07,703 --> 01:12:10,539
You've got much to do.
Rise and shine.

941
01:12:14,877 --> 01:12:17,421
Go and do what you have to do.

942
01:12:20,424 --> 01:12:23,260
Don't forget that the fight goes on!

943
01:12:23,468 --> 01:12:25,471
Yeah, yeah.
The fight goes on.

944
01:12:57,544 --> 01:13:01,089
Rising up
Back on the street

945
01:13:01,882 --> 01:13:04,676
Did my time
Took my chances

946
01:13:06,345 --> 01:13:09,389
Went the distance
Now I'm back on my feet

947
01:13:09,598 --> 01:13:13,519
Just a man and his will to survive

948
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:17,981
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the cream of the fight

949
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:22,653
Rising up to the challenge of our rival

950
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:26,990
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night

951
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:31,078
And he's watching us all in the eye

952
01:13:31,912 --> 01:13:33,497
Of the tiger

953
01:13:41,088 --> 01:13:42,673
I'm so hungry!

954
01:13:42,881 --> 01:13:45,217
- Didn't you eat yet?
- She's on a diet.

955
01:13:45,425 --> 01:13:48,804
- Are you nuts? - Her cousin asked her
to bring back an issue of Vogue.

956
01:13:49,012 --> 01:13:52,307
She's reading it all the time!

957
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:57,146
It looks like you've
caught someone's eye.

958
01:13:57,354 --> 01:13:58,689
Enough! I'm ashamed.

959
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:02,359
We'll talk about Botticelli.

960
01:14:02,568 --> 01:14:05,487
Venus Birth in particular.

961
01:14:06,029 --> 01:14:07,364
We could also...

962
01:14:07,573 --> 01:14:10,826
call it The Spring,
like the other great...

963
01:14:11,034 --> 01:14:14,872
...Botticelli's mythology
shown at the Offices.

964
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,582
Hey! You, there!

965
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:18,584
Why are you laughing?

966
01:14:22,629 --> 01:14:24,756
Do you wanna bet that
I'll take off my veil?

967
01:14:24,965 --> 01:14:27,259
- Yeah right!
- How much do we bet?

968
01:14:27,467 --> 01:14:28,760
400 tomans?

969
01:14:29,511 --> 01:14:30,512
Go!

970
01:14:41,106 --> 01:14:45,611
At the begining of the 90s,
the time of great ideals was over.

971
01:14:45,819 --> 01:14:50,657
After the Revolution, the government
had put so many students in prison

972
01:14:50,866 --> 01:14:53,660
that we didn't dare to talk
about politics anymore.

973
01:14:54,161 --> 01:14:56,497
And the war was finally behind us.

974
01:14:56,705 --> 01:14:59,708
We were looking for happiness
so much that we forgot

975
01:14:59,917 --> 01:15:02,085
that we weren't free.

976
01:16:13,532 --> 01:16:14,950
Grandma, are you here?

977
01:16:15,159 --> 01:16:16,702
Yes, I wanted to see you.

978
01:16:18,787 --> 01:16:21,832
How nice, you're all
dressed up to the nines!

979
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:23,792
Are you in love?

980
01:16:24,001 --> 01:16:26,461
Exactly, I had a date with him.

981
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:30,257
I got a real fright. Guardians
of the Revolution charged.

982
01:16:30,465 --> 01:16:32,801
Do you see how I'm made-up?

983
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:37,055
I was stuck. Then I remembered
this guy who was eyeballing me.

984
01:16:37,264 --> 01:16:38,515
You know them.

985
01:16:38,724 --> 01:16:41,810
I pretended to be
a little defenseless girl.

986
01:16:42,394 --> 01:16:43,520
Brother!

987
01:16:43,729 --> 01:16:44,771
Yes, sister?

988
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:46,899
A man said indecent things to me.

989
01:16:47,107 --> 01:16:50,110
Where is he so we can shut him up?

990
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:51,361
Over there.

991
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:52,696
That's him!

992
01:16:53,447 --> 01:16:56,450
Aren't you ashamed?
Don't you have a mother? A sister?

993
01:16:56,658 --> 01:16:58,494
Would you like it
if we insulted them?

994
01:16:58,952 --> 01:16:59,912
Ouch!

995
01:17:00,871 --> 01:17:03,624
I didn't do anything!
I swear it on my mother!

996
01:17:03,832 --> 01:17:06,293
What did they do with the guy?

997
01:17:06,502 --> 01:17:08,212
They picked him up.

998
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:09,546
Do you think that's funny?

999
01:17:09,755 --> 01:17:11,173
Yes, don't you?

1000
01:17:11,381 --> 01:17:15,385
I think that you're a fucking slut!
That's what I think.

1001
01:17:19,473 --> 01:17:21,225
I had no other choice!

1002
01:17:21,433 --> 01:17:22,559
Yes, you had!

1003
01:17:22,768 --> 01:17:24,978
Everybody has a choice.

1004
01:17:25,187 --> 01:17:27,731
Everybody always has a choice!

1005
01:17:29,066 --> 01:17:33,695
Your grandfather went to prison
for protecting innocents.

1006
01:17:33,904 --> 01:17:36,323
And your uncle Anouche!

1007
01:17:36,532 --> 01:17:38,200
Did you forget why he died?

1008
01:17:39,868 --> 01:17:41,829
What did I teach you?

1009
01:17:42,037 --> 01:17:44,164
Intergrity!

1010
01:17:45,165 --> 01:17:48,126
Does this word ring a bell, miss?

1011
01:17:50,838 --> 01:17:52,089
Shame on you!

1012
01:18:00,055 --> 01:18:01,473
The lady with the bag!

1013
01:18:01,682 --> 01:18:05,144
Stop running!
The lady with the bag!

1014
01:18:05,352 --> 01:18:08,313
Stop running!
Hey! Stop running!

1015
01:18:12,151 --> 01:18:14,278
Madam, why are you running?

1016
01:18:14,486 --> 01:18:16,238
I'm late.

1017
01:18:16,446 --> 01:18:17,990
You must not run like that.

1018
01:18:19,116 --> 01:18:23,453
When you run, your behind
makes indecent moves.

1019
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:26,206
Then don't look at my ass!!!

1020
01:18:41,263 --> 01:18:44,600
Fuck it! Wherever we stand,
we always see the same thing!

1021
01:18:44,808 --> 01:18:48,103
Anatomy lesson my ass! The only
thing sticking out is her big nose.

1022
01:18:48,312 --> 01:18:51,315
Go to the central university
immediately.

1023
01:18:51,523 --> 01:18:54,485
All the absentees

1024
01:18:54,693 --> 01:18:57,029
will be suspended for 2 weeks.

1025
01:19:00,032 --> 01:19:02,242
We must behave correctly.

1026
01:19:02,451 --> 01:19:05,662
The flowers of the Revolution
grew from the blood of our martyrs.

1027
01:19:05,871 --> 01:19:10,334
To have an indecent behavior is like
trampling on the blood of the martyrs.

1028
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:13,420
So, I'm asking to all
young ladies to wear

1029
01:19:13,629 --> 01:19:16,673
tighter trousers and
longer cowls.

1030
01:19:16,882 --> 01:19:20,719
They must cover their hair
and must not use any make-up.

1031
01:19:20,928 --> 01:19:22,513
Does anybody have a question?

1032
01:19:22,721 --> 01:19:26,225
If not, the session is ended.
Yes?

1033
01:19:26,433 --> 01:19:29,353
Our cowls are short,
our trousers are indecent,

1034
01:19:29,561 --> 01:19:31,230
we put on a lot of make-up, etc.

1035
01:19:31,438 --> 01:19:34,274
I spend a lot of
time at the workshop.

1036
01:19:34,483 --> 01:19:37,319
I need to be able to move
freely to draw.

1037
01:19:37,528 --> 01:19:40,781
A longer cowl makes it difficult.

1038
01:19:40,989 --> 01:19:45,661
Our trousers efficiently
hide our shapes.

1039
01:19:45,869 --> 01:19:48,330
Knowing that those trousers
are in fashion,

1040
01:19:48,539 --> 01:19:51,416
is the religion defending
our integrity...

1041
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:54,753
or is it simply
opposed to fashion?

1042
01:19:54,962 --> 01:19:57,798
You make comments about us
while the brothers...

1043
01:19:58,006 --> 01:20:00,050
have many different clothes
and hair cuts.

1044
01:20:00,259 --> 01:20:03,720
Sometimes, we can even
see their underwears.

1045
01:20:03,929 --> 01:20:06,223
Why is it that as a woman,

1046
01:20:06,431 --> 01:20:10,811
I'm not allowed to feel anything
when watching them,

1047
01:20:11,019 --> 01:20:14,439
while men can get excited on
our shorter cowls?

1048
01:20:15,858 --> 01:20:20,320
It's great. It's as if you had
cut their little dick.

1049
01:20:21,071 --> 01:20:25,242
Take off this fucking cowl.
It makes me claustrophobic.

1050
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:27,619
I tend to forget it.

1051
01:20:29,454 --> 01:20:31,373
Don't ever forget it.

1052
01:20:31,582 --> 01:20:34,793
It's fear that makes us
lose our self-awareness.

1053
01:20:35,002 --> 01:20:38,255
It's also changing us into cowards.

1054
01:20:38,463 --> 01:20:39,923
You had guts.

1055
01:20:40,132 --> 01:20:41,633
I'm proud of you.

1056
01:20:45,387 --> 01:20:46,972
- I want to leave.
- To go where?

1057
01:20:47,181 --> 01:20:48,807
To the USA or to Europe.

1058
01:20:49,766 --> 01:20:50,893
Where in Europe?

1059
01:20:51,101 --> 01:20:53,103
I can't stand living
here any longer.

1060
01:20:53,312 --> 01:20:54,396
What about us?

1061
01:20:54,605 --> 01:20:55,898
You'll come with me.

1062
01:20:56,106 --> 01:21:00,819
- I don't want to leave.
- That's because you're still nostalgic.

1063
01:21:01,028 --> 01:21:03,405
Sooner or later,
people will disgust you.

1064
01:21:04,031 --> 01:21:06,992
You can die in the West,
nobody cares.

1065
01:21:08,243 --> 01:21:09,953
Don't worry.

1066
01:21:11,121 --> 01:21:12,706
We'll manage.

1067
01:21:18,754 --> 01:21:21,131
What's your relationship with him?

1068
01:21:21,465 --> 01:21:22,466
Good.

1069
01:21:22,674 --> 01:21:24,927
We'll call your parents.

1070
01:21:25,135 --> 01:21:27,888
Either they pay
or it will be some lashing.

1071
01:21:37,689 --> 01:21:42,277
When your mother and I were 15,
we used to walk together holding hands.

1072
01:21:43,445 --> 01:21:44,738
Oh la la!

1073
01:21:44,947 --> 01:21:47,407
And yet it was in this country.

1074
01:21:50,327 --> 01:21:55,123
You know, that's how
the situation is now.

1075
01:21:55,332 --> 01:21:57,709
You have to be careful.

1076
01:21:57,918 --> 01:22:01,588
I think it's better if you're
not seen outside anymore.

1077
01:22:12,307 --> 01:22:15,853
This situation is unbearable.
We can't go anywhere.

1078
01:22:16,061 --> 01:22:19,565
We're like prisoners.
It's not a life!

1079
01:22:19,773 --> 01:22:23,068
Yeah... We can only get married.

1080
01:22:24,486 --> 01:22:25,529
So?

1081
01:22:50,262 --> 01:22:52,806
- Did you cry, mom?
- No.

1082
01:22:56,143 --> 01:23:00,105
I always wanted you to be
independent, educated and cultured.

1083
01:23:00,314 --> 01:23:02,733
And now you're getting married
at 21 years old!

1084
01:23:02,941 --> 01:23:07,070
I want you to leave Iran
to be free and liberated!

1085
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:08,363
Mama, it's fine.

1086
01:23:08,572 --> 01:23:11,158
Trust me.
I know what I'm doing.

1087
01:23:11,658 --> 01:23:13,744
One year later

1088
01:23:22,252 --> 01:23:25,130
- Did you see the car keys?
- Huh?

1089
01:23:25,339 --> 01:23:27,591
I left them here.

1090
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:28,801
I don't know.

1091
01:23:32,387 --> 01:23:34,056
They were here.

1092
01:23:55,953 --> 01:23:57,371
We don't share anything anymore.

1093
01:23:57,579 --> 01:24:00,290
You're the ideal couple to us.

1094
01:24:00,499 --> 01:24:01,834
Ideal couple, my ass!

1095
01:24:02,584 --> 01:24:04,419
What? You want my picture?

1096
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:07,130
Asshole!

1097
01:24:07,339 --> 01:24:10,676
Not so long ago,
you were saying that you loved him.

1098
01:24:10,884 --> 01:24:14,596
It's impossible to know...

1099
01:24:14,805 --> 01:24:16,014
until we live under the same roof.

1100
01:24:16,223 --> 01:24:19,309
What will you do?
Are you gonna get a divorce?

1101
01:24:20,227 --> 01:24:21,854
I don't know.

1102
01:24:22,062 --> 01:24:24,982
My sister left
her husband last year.

1103
01:24:26,150 --> 01:24:28,235
As soon as she got a divorce,

1104
01:24:28,443 --> 01:24:31,780
all men wanted to
have sex with her.

1105
01:24:31,989 --> 01:24:33,907
The butcher proposed her.

1106
01:24:34,116 --> 01:24:37,244
Then the baker and the greengrocer.

1107
01:24:37,452 --> 01:24:38,871
And even the beggars.

1108
01:24:40,038 --> 01:24:43,500
Men are convinced that
their thing is irresistible

1109
01:24:43,709 --> 01:24:47,880
and that a divorced woman will
accept since she's not a virgin anymore.

1110
01:24:49,798 --> 01:24:52,843
Stay with your husband
as long as you can.

1111
01:25:00,017 --> 01:25:01,101
Something's wrong?

1112
01:25:04,646 --> 01:25:06,648
Don't get yourself
into such a state!

1113
01:25:06,857 --> 01:25:07,774
Excuse me.

1114
01:25:07,983 --> 01:25:10,402
What is this sorrow for?

1115
01:25:10,611 --> 01:25:12,779
Grandma!

1116
01:25:12,988 --> 01:25:14,239
It's terrible!

1117
01:25:14,448 --> 01:25:16,575
What's so terrible?

1118
01:25:16,783 --> 01:25:19,995
I think that... I think that
I don't love Reza anymore.

1119
01:25:20,204 --> 01:25:22,539
I think we'll part.

1120
01:25:22,748 --> 01:25:25,584
So this is your terrible thing?

1121
01:25:25,792 --> 01:25:27,794
I thought somebody had died!

1122
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:31,507
You've no idea what you're saying!
I have a heart condition.

1123
01:25:31,715 --> 01:25:34,343
And you're talking to me like that!

1124
01:25:34,551 --> 01:25:38,347
All those tears for a simple divorce!

1125
01:25:43,477 --> 01:25:45,145
Listen to me carefully.

1126
01:25:45,354 --> 01:25:48,148
I did it 55 years ago.

1127
01:25:48,357 --> 01:25:51,527
Back then,
no one was getting a divorce.

1128
01:25:51,735 --> 01:25:55,531
I knew that I would be happier
alone than with a damned nuisance!

1129
01:25:55,739 --> 01:25:56,532
But...

1130
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:57,908
No buts!

1131
01:25:58,116 --> 01:26:01,161
A first wedding is a rough
work for the second one.

1132
01:26:01,370 --> 01:26:04,081
It will be better next time.

1133
01:26:10,212 --> 01:26:12,756
You're crying because
you were wrong.

1134
01:26:12,965 --> 01:26:16,510
It's hard to accept your own
mistakes, isn't it?

1135
01:29:01,925 --> 01:29:03,927
Where were you?

1136
01:29:04,136 --> 01:29:05,762
I was very worried.

1137
01:29:07,264 --> 01:29:08,849
Nima is dead.

1138
01:29:09,057 --> 01:29:11,226
Huh? What?

1139
01:29:11,435 --> 01:29:13,854
Nima is dead.

1140
01:29:16,857 --> 01:29:17,983
And I'm leaving you.

1141
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:24,740
The time had come for me to leave.

1142
01:29:24,948 --> 01:29:27,075
I decided to go to France.

1143
01:29:27,284 --> 01:29:30,746
I had to wait 3 months for a visa.

1144
01:29:32,331 --> 01:29:35,626
I went to the Caspian sea
with grandma

1145
01:29:35,834 --> 01:29:39,129
where I filled my lungs with
this unique air.

1146
01:29:40,547 --> 01:29:43,258
An air like nowhere else.

1147
01:29:52,810 --> 01:29:57,105
Then I promised grandpa
that he'd be proud of me.

1148
01:30:02,653 --> 01:30:04,738
Then I went behind the prison

1149
01:30:04,947 --> 01:30:08,033
where my uncle Anouche was resting,

1150
01:30:08,242 --> 01:30:10,202
somewhere next to
thousands of innocents.

1151
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:14,373
I promised him to try and stay true
to myself as much as possible.

1152
01:30:29,179 --> 01:30:31,598
Then, one day, the time
to leave had come.

1153
01:30:32,224 --> 01:30:34,685
My father cried, as usual.

1154
01:30:39,064 --> 01:30:41,567
You're leaving forever.
You're a free woman.

1155
01:30:41,775 --> 01:30:43,902
Iran of today isn't for you.

1156
01:30:44,111 --> 01:30:45,863
I forbid you to come back.

1157
01:30:46,071 --> 01:30:48,574
Yes, mom.
Grandma!

1158
01:30:48,782 --> 01:30:50,659
My sweet little girl!

1159
01:31:11,305 --> 01:31:13,515
I never saw my grandma again.

1160
01:31:15,476 --> 01:31:17,728
She died a little later.

1161
01:31:18,896 --> 01:31:21,440
Freedom always has a price.

1162
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:09,863
Ah! What a shitty weather!

1163
01:32:12,241 --> 01:32:13,784
Where do you come from?

1164
01:32:15,828 --> 01:32:17,246
Iran.

1165
01:32:19,998 --> 01:32:23,377
Grandma, how do you always
smell so good?

1166
01:32:23,585 --> 01:32:26,547
I pick up jasmine
flowers every morning

1167
01:32:26,755 --> 01:32:29,591
and I put them in my bra.

1168
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:32,761
This way, I always smell good.

1169
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:35,597
Wow! That's great!

1170
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,063
