1
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:12,372
Wha-ho!

2
00:01:12,838 --> 00:01:13,850
Whoa!

3
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:19,500
Oh! Man, oh, man!

4
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:21,800
I almost lost it
back there.

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,116
I didn't know
what was going on.

6
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:24,386
Oh!

7
00:01:25,317 --> 00:01:27,520
Oh... Oh!

8
00:01:44,496 --> 00:01:45,500
Mmm.

9
00:01:50,142 --> 00:01:52,824
- Oh, hey, babe? Doug?
- Huh?

10
00:01:52,824 --> 00:01:55,975
Can you take Billy to school today?
My day kinda... got away from me.

11
00:01:55,975 --> 00:01:58,962
Yeah, yeah. Unless there's
an emergency at the office.

12
00:01:58,962 --> 00:02:00,206
Oh, was there an emergency?

13
00:02:00,206 --> 00:02:02,590
You know, dentists
do have emergencies.

14
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,129
- Oh.
- Sometimes.

15
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:09,394
- Ah.
- We are doctors.

16
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:15,133
Hey, no, no! Not until your LDL
is under a hundred.

17
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:21,201
Well, Mr. Putnam,
any plans this summer?

18
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:24,524
What's... What'd he say?

19
00:02:24,524 --> 00:02:26,848
He said we're taking
an African safari.

20
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:30,675
Africa. I don't think I've been
out of Cincinnati in 12 years.

21
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:33,793
You owe it to yourself
to get out and enjoy life.

22
00:02:33,793 --> 00:02:38,780
You can't just live to work!
You need excitement!

23
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:41,595
Come on. Don't be a baby,

24
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:45,221
it's a d... Oh, the suction,
the extractor. Hold on.

25
00:02:45,221 --> 00:02:47,098
That'll suck the spots
off a Dalmatian.

26
00:02:47,411 --> 00:02:49,354
Help me, help me,
all right.

27
00:02:49,354 --> 00:02:52,330
Know what they call this?
One powerful little sucker.

28
00:02:52,404 --> 00:02:54,171
That's the brand name.
It's unbelievable.

29
00:02:54,813 --> 00:02:58,270
See that? I have plenty of excitement
in my life, thank you, Mrs. Putnam.

30
00:03:03,682 --> 00:03:04,368
<i>Bobby?</i>

31
00:03:04,368 --> 00:03:06,862
Karen, I asked
for no disturbances.

32
00:03:06,862 --> 00:03:08,686
<i>I need
to talk to you, Bobby.</i>

33
00:03:08,806 --> 00:03:11,813
Technically,
I'm at the office right now.

34
00:03:11,813 --> 00:03:14,407
And technically, you're
in our guest bedroom.

35
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,656
Look, I know baby. I... I just
gotta finish this chapter.

36
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:18,672
I know.
But you know what?

37
00:03:18,672 --> 00:03:21,215
I have to go to a job
that actually makes us money.

38
00:03:21,215 --> 00:03:23,644
And I'm late,
so... walk me to the door.

39
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,275
Come on, Bobby.
I gotta get to work. Okay?

40
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:27,919
Oh, wait.
I forgot my cell phone.

41
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,226
- Stay.
- Hey, daddy! Listen!

42
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:35,412
Hey, no. Inside voice.

43
00:03:35,412 --> 00:03:37,827
- Inside voice.
- Would you shut up?

44
00:03:37,827 --> 00:03:40,586
God, it's like living
with a car alarm that shits.

45
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,328
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doin'
tryin' to leave the house wearin' that?

46
00:03:44,328 --> 00:03:47,810
- You look like a Eskimo hooker.
- Dad, that's the point.

47
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,596
- You wanna look like a hooker?
- Dad, you are so lame.

48
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:55,481
It's hard for kids to respect a man
that don't do none of the providing.

49
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:59,783
In my day the lady stayed home.
Not the lazy man.

50
00:03:59,783 --> 00:04:02,498
In your day, the men
had pyramids to build.

51
00:04:02,498 --> 00:04:04,140
How old is that?

52
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,905
I'm in complete
control of my finan...

53
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:07,570
No.

54
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:11,469
Hush. Come.

55
00:04:11,723 --> 00:04:13,965
How come she gets quiet
when you say something to her?

56
00:04:13,965 --> 00:04:16,700
Because you, my darling,
have no control.

57
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:21,048
Baby, I know your how-to book
is gonna be a huge success someday.

58
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,365
But do you remember
what day today is?

59
00:04:23,428 --> 00:04:23,914
No.

60
00:04:23,914 --> 00:04:26,432
See, we had agreed that
you would take a year off

61
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:30,256
to pursue this little fantasy
of yours, but... that year is up.

62
00:04:30,256 --> 00:04:32,151
Now you and I
had a deal.

63
00:04:32,151 --> 00:04:34,820
Come on, baby.
Stressful cases.

64
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,769
Clients under duress...

65
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:40,011
I'm tired of dealing
with shit all the time.

66
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:42,587
Besides, how do we even know
they'll take me back?

67
00:04:42,587 --> 00:04:44,676
- Because I called.
- You're serious?

68
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:48,058
The Firm is ecstatic
to have you back, Bobby.

69
00:04:48,058 --> 00:04:50,128
You got a nine o'clock
appointment.

70
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:55,211
- You call The Firm?
- Yeah, men's room.

71
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:59,226
Some truck's driver must've crap
an entire cow in there, man.

72
00:04:59,226 --> 00:05:00,620
Good luck.

73
00:05:03,648 --> 00:05:05,103
I didn't want to
give him the key,

74
00:05:05,103 --> 00:05:07,615
but... I didn't trust
my instincts.

75
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:18,482
I saw my father shot.
I never cry until today.

76
00:05:22,394 --> 00:05:25,715
I got robbed yesterday,
and I know now,

77
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,264
- your job is the bad one.
- Yeah.

78
00:05:48,545 --> 00:05:51,486
- Dudley?
- Yes, good morning, Mac.

79
00:05:51,486 --> 00:05:52,462
How's it going?

80
00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:55,487
<i>It is now
nine o'clock a.m.</i>

81
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:58,686
Thanks, Mac.
Open Internet, please.

82
00:05:58,686 --> 00:06:01,923
- Command unknown.
- Open Internet.

83
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,754
<i>Internet open.</i>

84
00:06:04,913 --> 00:06:07,188
I think I have to research
alternative specs.

85
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:12,077
<i>- Searching alternative sex.
- What? No. I didn't say that.</i>

86
00:06:12,077 --> 00:06:13,944
<i>Want granny
to take her teeth out?</i>

87
00:06:13,944 --> 00:06:15,590
<i>- Barnyard love.
- Shut down.</i>

88
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:19,464
- I'm sorry.
- Enjoy the animals.

89
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,428
<i>Granny's gonna
spank your bottom.</i>

90
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:25,804
<i>All kinds of fun.</i>

91
00:06:27,193 --> 00:06:28,613
I can fix that.

92
00:06:31,772 --> 00:06:32,982
Or not.

93
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:37,901
Well, iCat.

94
00:06:39,335 --> 00:06:41,093
Looks like
it's just you and me.

95
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:54,190
Okay, Larry, so what are
you tryin' to tell me?

96
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,286
- You're broke.
- Well, how does that work?

97
00:06:56,286 --> 00:06:59,253
That means you've spent everything
you had, then you spent some more.

98
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,493
This is... right here.
Nothing. Zero.

99
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,416
You know what?

100
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:05,170
Maybe it's time for my wife,
the "supermodel",

101
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,888
to start paying for some things.
I mean, for once in her life.

102
00:07:07,888 --> 00:07:10,029
You're getting divorced,
why would she pay?

103
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,916
Divorced, going broke...

104
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,525
You think I'm falling apart,
dont you?

105
00:07:14,525 --> 00:07:16,720
Not going broke.
You are broke.

106
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,874
- Okay.
- The door's behind you.

107
00:07:19,052 --> 00:07:22,129
No, no, you listen to me, Toby.
You're not gonna push me around.

108
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:25,075
Look, we agreed on a price, and
that's the price I'm gonna pay.

109
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,451
You got it? And if you don't like it,
just walk away.

110
00:07:28,451 --> 00:07:31,121
I'll tell you this, you can
kiss your business goodbye.

111
00:07:31,121 --> 00:07:34,361
Because if you screw with Woody Stevens,
you go down hard. You got that?

112
00:07:34,698 --> 00:07:37,386
What?
No, money is not a problem.

113
00:07:37,386 --> 00:07:39,949
Don't insult me.
Don't insult me!

114
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:41,459
Money's never a problem!

115
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:44,145
You just have to honor
the correct price, you got that?

116
00:07:44,473 --> 00:07:45,487
What?

117
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,535
Well, then go home, Toby!
You make me sick!

118
00:07:52,535 --> 00:07:54,990
I can't do this many leaves
for ten bucks.

119
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,486
It'll take hours!

120
00:07:56,486 --> 00:07:58,551
Well, you should've thought
of that before you put that flyer

121
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:02,223
on the telephone pole saying
"Any yard for ten bucks".

122
00:08:03,295 --> 00:08:07,367
Toby. Come on, let's talk.
Let's talk like men, okay?

123
00:08:08,783 --> 00:08:09,928
Well, what's the problem?

124
00:08:09,928 --> 00:08:13,953
- Money's the problem!
- Grow up, Toby!

125
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:17,747
- I hate you.
- I hate you!

126
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:20,317
Moron!

127
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,385
- Kel, it's me.
- I'll be right down.

128
00:08:27,706 --> 00:08:28,795
Hey, Bill.

129
00:08:29,296 --> 00:08:33,435
Uh, you wanna shoot some hoops or
something before I take my ride?

130
00:08:33,435 --> 00:08:34,912
No, thanks.

131
00:08:38,136 --> 00:08:40,817
Hey, babe.
How was work?

132
00:08:40,817 --> 00:08:41,928
- Mmm.
- Great.

133
00:08:41,928 --> 00:08:43,140
Good.

134
00:08:44,378 --> 00:08:46,314
Hello? Cool.
I'll ask her now.

135
00:08:46,314 --> 00:08:47,974
Hey, mom, can I play ball
with Stew and his dad?

136
00:08:47,974 --> 00:08:50,087
- Course you can.
- Cool. Thanks.

137
00:08:50,337 --> 00:08:52,681
Here, dude, I'll be right over,
okay? All right, bye.

138
00:08:52,681 --> 00:08:55,715
Bill, I just asked you a couple of second ago
if you wanted to play ball. You said no.

139
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:58,232
Well, yeah. I mean,
Stew's dad is awesome.

140
00:08:58,232 --> 00:08:59,932
He can totally dunk.

141
00:09:00,144 --> 00:09:01,761
The hoop's what?
Eight feet above the ground?

142
00:09:01,761 --> 00:09:06,684
- Anybody could dunk that.
- Well. See you guys later.

143
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:10,464
Doug, I am so sorry.
You know, I had no idea.

144
00:09:10,464 --> 00:09:12,314
It wasn't your fault.
You didn't know.

145
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:15,672
What do I gotta do
to relate to my son?

146
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,444
Hey, guys?

147
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,137
Does this sound better?

148
00:09:43,477 --> 00:09:44,496
Whoa!

149
00:09:52,215 --> 00:09:55,389
I'm okay!
I hit my butt.

150
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:35,132
Thanks, Woody.

151
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,775
I feel really safe with you.

152
00:10:36,775 --> 00:10:39,804
I noticed. If you ever
lay your head on my back again

153
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:42,401
when you're riding, bitch,
I'll throw you in the traffic.

154
00:10:43,196 --> 00:10:45,906
I... I was just trying
to keep the wind off my face.

155
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:49,149
- I felt you smell my neck.
- Guys, could we?

156
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,537
Did you smell
that man's neck?

157
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:58,247
His cologne is fantastic.
It's musky with an oaky finish.

158
00:10:58,523 --> 00:11:04,246
- Like a... lawyer cowboy.
- Lawyer cowboy?

159
00:11:04,536 --> 00:11:06,901
Wild Hogs aren't welcome here.

160
00:11:07,984 --> 00:11:09,132
- Hey, Paul.
- How you doing?

161
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,361
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Paul.

162
00:11:10,435 --> 00:11:10,702
Hey, Woody.

163
00:11:11,156 --> 00:11:14,111
Just waiting on those K-ones
to do your, uh, tax returns?

164
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:17,444
We also need to talk about that
offshore incorporating thing.

165
00:11:17,615 --> 00:11:18,994
Yeah, well,
I'll give you a call.

166
00:11:18,994 --> 00:11:22,861
Okay. I'll set up lunch.
Or we could do a day at the spa.

167
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:24,697
Now that was fun.

168
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:28,161
I don't remember that.

169
00:11:28,161 --> 00:11:31,385
- Got your wine cooler, dad.
- Oh, sweet. Thanks.

170
00:11:32,027 --> 00:11:34,791
- I'll see you Hogs in Hell!
- We'll make it.

171
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,408
- That was scary, Paul. Good work.
- See you later.

172
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:40,337
- I'm not coming here anymore.
- But this is a Wild Hog tradition.

173
00:11:40,337 --> 00:11:43,204
We're not Wild Hogs,
we're like wild lambs.

174
00:11:43,358 --> 00:11:45,563
It's just a patch
that Doug's wife made.

175
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:47,695
We sewed it on our jackets
so she wouldn't feel bad.

176
00:11:47,695 --> 00:11:49,328
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah.

177
00:11:49,328 --> 00:11:51,508
Well, what has
your wife ever made us?

178
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:52,543
Hard.

179
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:54,937
- Hey.
- That's true, she is really.

180
00:11:55,013 --> 00:11:58,382
- All I'm saying is she's good-looking.
- Show some respect.

181
00:11:58,382 --> 00:12:00,787
Come on. That's what your wife does.
She's a swimsuit model.

182
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:03,286
And it... And a good one,
I mean. She is hot.

183
00:12:03,286 --> 00:12:07,292
Okay, here's a question:
What are we doing here?

184
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:09,688
Havin'... Havin' beers
like we do every week.

185
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:13,418
No, no, no. Bigger picture. Life, man.
What do we have to look forward to?

186
00:12:13,418 --> 00:12:16,126
Riding in formation in
the Labor Day Parade, is that it?

187
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:17,947
I'm really looking forward
to the parade.

188
00:12:17,947 --> 00:12:20,395
I got Tootsie Rolls
I can throw to the kids.

189
00:12:20,872 --> 00:12:21,983
Tootsie Rolls

190
00:12:21,983 --> 00:12:24,171
that he can throw
to the kids.

191
00:12:24,171 --> 00:12:27,536
Man, you can't even put on
your turn signal without bustin' your ass.

192
00:12:27,536 --> 00:12:30,550
Look, let's put some
real miles on those bikes.

193
00:12:30,698 --> 00:12:34,426
- Road trip?
- Yeah. A road trip.

194
00:12:34,426 --> 00:12:38,493
Just us. No rules.
No Tootsie Rolls.

195
00:12:38,493 --> 00:12:40,871
Just us, the wind,
the road to the Pacific.

196
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:43,000
You know, we camp out
for a week, whenever we want,

197
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,166
wherever we want...

198
00:12:45,037 --> 00:12:46,569
I mean,
that's freedom, man.

199
00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:48,589
As long as we stop
at some Wi-Fi hotspots,

200
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:50,047
- count me in.
- You're in?

201
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,968
- Yep.
- All right.

202
00:12:50,968 --> 00:12:54,711
Eh, I can't. I ca...
I-I can't get the time off of work.

203
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,094
- You know, I'm a doctor.
- You're a dentist.

204
00:12:57,094 --> 00:13:00,750
Look, in college... Man,
he'd have been packed already.

205
00:13:01,122 --> 00:13:04,048
I'm not kidding. You-you-you know,
and on a bike, he's fearless.

206
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,671
- He was fearless.
- Yeah, well, that was...

207
00:13:05,671 --> 00:13:07,078
This guy, we called him
"The Golden Knight".

208
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:09,931
Where's that guy?
I wanna see that guy again.

209
00:13:09,931 --> 00:13:11,393
That guy's married now.

210
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:15,605
And that guy, uh, used to...
used to get high a lot.

211
00:13:15,752 --> 00:13:18,064
- What's Claudia gonna say about this?
- Nothin'.

212
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:22,051
She's in the Bahamas doing some
swimsuit thing for "Sports Illustrated".

213
00:13:22,508 --> 00:13:24,430
Look, if not now, when?

214
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,499
Y'all know me.
I'm the first to get buck wild.

215
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:28,791
- No, you're not.
- But...

216
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,753
You're just afraid
to ask your wife.

217
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:35,288
- True. True. I said true!
- Come on!

218
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:39,036
This is it, on the edge, we're living!
You know, "St. Elmo's Fire",

219
00:13:39,036 --> 00:13:41,120
"The Wild Bunch".
You know, "Deliverance"!

220
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,685
"Deliverance"?

221
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:43,738
- You know...
- "Deliverance"?

222
00:13:43,846 --> 00:13:45,162
"Deliverance"?

223
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,915
Hey, dudes. We're gonna
ride as an American flag

224
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:50,334
in the parade this year.

225
00:13:50,334 --> 00:13:52,737
Each guy in our chapter
is a star.

226
00:13:52,737 --> 00:13:54,542
- A what?
- I'm gonna get sick.

227
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,853
- Who's gonna do the stripes?
- The Lyman Middle School majorettes.

228
00:13:57,853 --> 00:14:00,202
Oh, boy. Hey, Doug,
we're really living now, huh?

229
00:14:00,202 --> 00:14:02,455
I hope we don't get hit
by a stray baton.

230
00:14:02,774 --> 00:14:04,234
You know what?
I'm outta here.

231
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:06,772
I'm going with you guys
or without you guys.

232
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:07,905
You know what I mean?

233
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:09,841
Take your smelly tees,
whatever. Good night.

234
00:14:10,148 --> 00:14:12,336
- I said I'd go.
- Come on back.

235
00:14:12,371 --> 00:14:14,300
Hmm.
Oh, I almost forgot.

236
00:14:14,786 --> 00:14:16,717
We're also gonna be wearing
these black ribbons

237
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:19,519
in honor of Tom Peterson.
He died last week...

238
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,535
Boom! Just like that.
Anyway, he'll be missed.

239
00:14:25,482 --> 00:14:27,226
Tom Peterson...
Tom Peterson...

240
00:14:27,226 --> 00:14:28,991
You remember that guy?

241
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:31,172
He was our age.

242
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:44,625
- Mom, want some gravy?
- Oh, yeah, thanks.

243
00:14:46,565 --> 00:14:49,023
- So, how was your ride?
- I don't know.

244
00:14:49,023 --> 00:14:52,788
All Woody did was yap about
taking some stupid cross-country trip.

245
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:54,944
So... so do you wanna talk
about going on this ride?

246
00:14:54,944 --> 00:14:56,437
I can't go
on a cross-country trip.

247
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,173
I just can't walk away
from work anytime I want.

248
00:14:59,582 --> 00:15:01,305
Yeah, you know what,
you're right.

249
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,306
It's just as well.

250
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:06,463
You know, road trips probably aren't
the... best thing for a guy your age.

251
00:15:06,463 --> 00:15:08,213
I mean, it's gotta be
really inconvenient, you know.

252
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:10,472
Bunch of middle-aged guys,
having to get off their bikes

253
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,561
every 20 minutes or so
to take a pee...

254
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:16,145
My age? What kind of crack is that?
What's wrong with my age?

255
00:15:16,145 --> 00:15:18,289
I mean, she talks like
I'm not right here, you know?

256
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:19,955
Doug, I'm joking.

257
00:15:19,955 --> 00:15:23,081
No, you don't. You know what I think?
I think you think I'm a boring guy.

258
00:15:23,081 --> 00:15:25,476
I'm old and I'm boring now.
I've become lame.

259
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:28,680
I think everybody thinks that
at this table. I'm lame! I'm just lame.

260
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,231
- Admit it! I'm lame!
- Doug, calm down. It's...

261
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:32,959
No, I'm not gonna calm down.
Cause you know what I think?

262
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,217
"Calming down" means
just another word for "lame"!

263
00:15:36,217 --> 00:15:39,605
I'm not lame!
You know, I'm wild and free!

264
00:15:39,723 --> 00:15:42,435
Wild and free
and a man, yeah!

265
00:15:42,435 --> 00:15:45,047
A man that likes to eat meat.
I'm tired of not eating meat!

266
00:15:45,047 --> 00:15:47,268
Meat's good!
Good for men.

267
00:15:47,268 --> 00:15:51,180
And potatoes. I like
potatoes and I like gravy

268
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,340
on my potatoes.
Yum, yum!

269
00:15:59,457 --> 00:16:01,719
- Don't make sudden moves.
- I'm living wild, I'm living good.

270
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:04,222
- And it feels good, baby!
- Whoa, no, no, dad. Your LDL.

271
00:16:04,222 --> 00:16:07,255
Butt out, LDLs! I miss butter.
You know why I miss butter?

272
00:16:07,255 --> 00:16:09,963
The French think butter
is just like cheese, they eat it...

273
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:12,999
They eat it just like that.
Right off the stick.

274
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:17,235
And the French, who've never won
a major battle, they know how to eat!

275
00:16:17,248 --> 00:16:18,096
And I...

276
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:22,051
I am living,
and it feels great!

277
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:28,697
Mmm...

278
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,415
Doug, are you okay?

279
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:34,658
Doug, you okay?

280
00:16:34,658 --> 00:16:35,869
- Yeah!
- Dad, just spit it out!

281
00:16:36,188 --> 00:16:37,102
I'm all right.

282
00:16:37,102 --> 00:16:38,830
- Dad, just... just spit it out!
- Come on.

283
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:41,030
- Breathe, breathe, breathe!
- I am not all right.

284
00:16:44,141 --> 00:16:46,806
- Well, Mr. Madsen...
- Dr. Madsen.

285
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:50,266
Oh, really? Great. Well, then
I can put this a little more simply.

286
00:16:50,266 --> 00:16:52,057
Looks like you had
a catecholamine-induced,

287
00:16:52,057 --> 00:16:54,144
super-ventricular
tachyarrhythmia.

288
00:16:54,895 --> 00:16:58,727
I'm actually a dentist, so
I have no idea what you just said.

289
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:01,243
- Stress-induced panic attack.
- I'm not stressed.

290
00:17:01,243 --> 00:17:04,778
Your body says otherwise. You know,
we see this a lot in middle-aged men.

291
00:17:04,778 --> 00:17:07,836
- I'm not middle-aged.
- We hear that a lot, too.

292
00:17:08,103 --> 00:17:10,220
How 'bout we get you
out of here in a few minutes?

293
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:12,338
<i>Dr. Wesley to imaging.
Dr. Wesley to imaging.</i>

294
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:14,875
I am a middle-aged man,
aren't I?

295
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,894
Only mathematically.

296
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,208
I think you need
to let off some steam.

297
00:17:21,243 --> 00:17:23,360
You used to love
to travel.

298
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:25,636
No, Doug, you used to play hockey.
You were crazy, man.

299
00:17:25,636 --> 00:17:27,545
You don't even sing
annoying eighties music anymore.

300
00:17:27,545 --> 00:17:29,027
Well, it's different now.

301
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:32,581
You know, I had to slow down
for... for you and... Billy.

302
00:17:32,581 --> 00:17:34,567
Oh, so I'm the one
who did this to you?

303
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:35,676
I'm in a hospital.

304
00:17:35,676 --> 00:17:39,038
It's a lot easier for me right now
to blame other people for my problems.

305
00:17:40,408 --> 00:17:43,393
I think you should
go on that trip.

306
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:46,267
If you don't, I will fire up
the hog and go with the guys.

307
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:49,203
- Woody doesn't even have a plan.
- He never does.

308
00:17:49,203 --> 00:17:51,282
It's like taking
a trip to nowhere.

309
00:17:52,253 --> 00:17:54,957
Maybe that's exactly
what you need.

310
00:18:00,843 --> 00:18:01,963
What up?

311
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:06,452
Hey. You're late! Supposed to
be here at eight-thirty, guys.

312
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:09,832
Hey, look here.
If Karen calls,

313
00:18:09,832 --> 00:18:14,759
okay?, I'm at a toilet
bowl seminar in Cleveland.

314
00:18:15,915 --> 00:18:18,642
Hey, no, I'm serious. I need y'all
to cover for me now, all right?

315
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:20,713
Yeah, sure.

316
00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:24,591
What? What?
What are you looking at?

317
00:18:24,591 --> 00:18:25,615
I got a tat.

318
00:18:25,615 --> 00:18:27,650
- Come on!
- Well, hell just froze over.

319
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:31,398
- Let's see it!
- I'm a biker, dude! I got a tat.

320
00:18:31,472 --> 00:18:34,655
- It's an apple.
- Uh, Dudley, you know, uh...

321
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,887
I know. Trademarked.
But what are they gonna say?

322
00:18:37,887 --> 00:18:40,555
It's in my skin, bitch!

323
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,823
- You guys aren't gonna wear helmets?
- Maybe I don't wanna wear a helmet.

324
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:49,000
Maybe I don't want anything
between me and the road.

325
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,705
You will
if your head falls on it.

326
00:18:50,705 --> 00:18:54,017
Woody, 62 percent of motorcycle
fatalities can be prevented

327
00:18:54,017 --> 00:18:56,207
- with the use of an approved DOT helmet.
- That right?

328
00:18:56,207 --> 00:18:59,715
What's that leather condom
gonna protect you from? Snoopy?

329
00:18:59,715 --> 00:19:01,445
The Red Baron?
How about dating?

330
00:19:01,445 --> 00:19:03,471
- You told me you liked it.
- Guys, guys, hey, hey, hey!

331
00:19:03,471 --> 00:19:07,338
There are no rules on this trip, remember?
We're just heading for the Pacific,

332
00:19:07,338 --> 00:19:10,890
- and there ain't no plans.
- Right. Well, we got a week to do this, right?

333
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,947
So I figure we gotta be
in Illinois by tonight.

334
00:19:12,947 --> 00:19:15,570
Well, the way I mapped it out,
we should be a...  hundred miles

335
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,660
- past St. Louis by sundown.
- Good.

336
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,986
What did I say?
I said it's the open road, okay?

337
00:19:20,986 --> 00:19:23,535
- Who knows where we're gonna be?
- I know where we're gonna be.

338
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:26,516
Dudley hooked me up.
Check out this thing.

339
00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:28,083
It's a GPS in my phone now.

340
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,744
- Just look at that thing.
- No kiddin'? Let me see that.

341
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,686
- Cool!
- What are you...?

342
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,114
- Hey, numbnuts, what'd you do that for?!
- For the good of the trip.

343
00:19:35,114 --> 00:19:37,925
You don't need a GPS
to discover America.

344
00:19:37,925 --> 00:19:39,842
You need a bike and
you need the road, okay?

345
00:19:39,842 --> 00:19:43,177
Freedom. And if we have an
emergency, I got a cell phone.

346
00:19:43,177 --> 00:19:44,423
- No you don't.
- What?

347
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:47,987
Hey! Why did you do that?
I got all my data in there!

348
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:50,206
Well, how does that feel,
Woody?

349
00:19:51,437 --> 00:19:53,707
Feels good. Whoo!

350
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,658
It's my prerogative!
Mm-mm-mm-mm!

351
00:19:56,658 --> 00:19:58,622
- No cell phones!
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

352
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:00,054
- Come on, get rid of it.
- No, Doug, he's right.

353
00:20:00,178 --> 00:20:02,515
- No, wait, wait...
- Whoo!

354
00:20:02,515 --> 00:20:06,192
Yeah! Yeah, Wild Hogs, baby!
Wild Hogs!

355
00:20:06,192 --> 00:20:08,109
You just did that so
Karen wouldn't call you.

356
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:09,705
- Exactly.
- Come on, give it up.

357
00:20:09,705 --> 00:20:13,375
So, we're not gonna discuss this?
We're not gonna even think about this? No, don't!

358
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,839
- We need one phone.
- Freedom, baby!

359
00:20:20,314 --> 00:20:21,509
We gotta go.

360
00:20:22,459 --> 00:20:25,207
- Go, go!
- Come back here!

361
00:20:53,451 --> 00:20:54,850
- Hey!
- Whoo!

362
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:56,318
Where're you guys headed?

363
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,241
I love you!

364
00:21:02,093 --> 00:21:03,601
You're hot!

365
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:26,509
- Losers.
- Look at these guys.

366
00:21:28,066 --> 00:21:29,307
Hey.

367
00:21:30,314 --> 00:21:32,038
You guys wanna a ride?

368
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:39,055
All right.
Sleeping bags are all set.

369
00:21:42,254 --> 00:21:45,317
Bobby, I got two words
for you: foot pump.

370
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:49,668
Woody, I got four words for you:
Got a cheap-ass wife.

371
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:54,467
Hey, guys, this is poop.
So don't eat it.

372
00:21:54,467 --> 00:21:56,786
- Oh, God.
- Excuse me, Mr. Hard Drive,

373
00:21:56,786 --> 00:21:58,883
you're supposed to bury it,
not put it in a bag.

374
00:21:58,883 --> 00:22:01,275
This is plastic,
I'm not gonna put it in the earth.

375
00:22:01,275 --> 00:22:03,573
I'll find a garbage can
tomorrow.

376
00:22:05,222 --> 00:22:08,672
So you gonna sit right next to me
with that doo-doo.

377
00:22:10,977 --> 00:22:14,073
Hey! Come on.
Doesn't get any better than this.

378
00:22:14,073 --> 00:22:17,580
Sitting around a fire, chilling with
your best friends, just relaxing, enjoying...

379
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,353
I'm sorry, Dudley, you gotta get...
You gotta... You gotta bury that thing.

380
00:22:20,353 --> 00:22:23,148
- Otherwise I'll vomit in your lap.
- ... each other's company.

381
00:22:23,148 --> 00:22:25,696
All right. I'll hang it from a tree
so the bears don't get it.

382
00:22:25,696 --> 00:22:28,538
- No, don't hang it in a tree!
- Why not?

383
00:22:28,538 --> 00:22:30,421
Cause bears don't eat shit!

384
00:22:38,122 --> 00:22:39,088
What's up?

385
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:43,650
D'you ever wake up and wonder
what happened to your life?

386
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:46,239
I really had
such great plans.

387
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:49,584
My life and my work
would be an adventure. You know?

388
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,982
All of a sudden
I'm a suburban dentist.

389
00:22:51,982 --> 00:22:54,129
Hey, look, Doug,
I feel your pain, man.

390
00:22:54,253 --> 00:22:57,051
Look, I swore I would
never return to a job

391
00:22:57,051 --> 00:23:00,190
where I had to wear
condoms on my shoes.

392
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,111
- You're still at The Firm?
- Yeah.

393
00:23:02,111 --> 00:23:05,462
I get... yelled at
by an ungrateful wife all night...

394
00:23:05,462 --> 00:23:08,655
- The whole thing has made me...
- A wimp.

395
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:12,160
I was gonna say miserable.
But you think I'm a wimp?

396
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,266
No, no, I thought you were gonna say
wimp, so I just filled it in.

397
00:23:15,266 --> 00:23:17,940
You're... you're a wimp, Bobby.
I... I'll say it.

398
00:23:18,632 --> 00:23:20,941
I mean, you're afraid of women.
It's kind of embarrassing.

399
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:24,040
- I'm afraid of women.
- You're afraid to talk to women.

400
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,365
Bobby's afraid
they'll kill him in his sleep.

401
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:31,132
Wow. Now I'm really
afraid of women.

402
00:23:31,132 --> 00:23:33,601
Well, at least one of us
is living the fairy tale.

403
00:23:33,601 --> 00:23:35,851
Right, Woody? Plenty of money,
travel all the time,

404
00:23:35,851 --> 00:23:38,148
you got the swimsuit model
for a wife...

405
00:23:38,148 --> 00:23:40,225
At least one of us
has got it made.

406
00:23:40,225 --> 00:23:43,388
Well, one man's fairy tale
is another man's nightmare.

407
00:23:45,256 --> 00:23:47,624
You think that the
marshmallow's done, Doug?

408
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,781
Hey, look at that. Anybody
want the first marshmallow?

409
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,593
Starting to look like
Dudley's helmet.

410
00:23:56,489 --> 00:23:57,777
All right.

411
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,081
- I think I'm halfway there.
- Oh, in only one hour?

412
00:24:02,081 --> 00:24:03,755
Bobby, you sure
you wanna do that?

413
00:24:03,755 --> 00:24:06,979
You could use one of the spare
bags we got in the... tent!

414
00:24:07,545 --> 00:24:09,664
Hey, Dudley, go get
the water jug out of my bag!

415
00:24:09,851 --> 00:24:11,982
I want... Kick, kick,
kick, kick! Dirt! Dirt!

416
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:12,999
I got it!

417
00:24:13,217 --> 00:24:15,134
That's camp-stove fuel!

418
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,695
No!

419
00:24:19,447 --> 00:24:22,373
- This is the wrong jug!
- You think?

420
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:26,178
Aw, God. This is supposed
to be flame-retardant.

421
00:24:26,178 --> 00:24:28,698
Guess it wasn't
"Dudley-retardant".

422
00:24:30,607 --> 00:24:32,455
All my drawers are burning.

423
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,549
Oh, perfect!

424
00:24:52,356 --> 00:24:52,848
What are you doin'?

425
00:24:52,848 --> 00:24:55,115
Hmm? Keeping my face
out of the wind.

426
00:24:56,738 --> 00:25:01,423
Hey. Oh!
Boy, my ass is sore.

427
00:25:01,423 --> 00:25:02,837
Mine, too.

428
00:25:03,018 --> 00:25:06,323
It's Woody's fault
for riding us so hard yesterday.

429
00:25:06,323 --> 00:25:10,423
The human body wasn't made to straddle
something that big for that long.

430
00:25:10,808 --> 00:25:14,463
Well, you know, it's gonna hurt a little
bit, but that's part of the experience.

431
00:25:14,463 --> 00:25:16,246
That's why
we didn't bring our wives.

432
00:25:16,246 --> 00:25:18,799
What the...
What the hell?

433
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,807
Somebody wanna explain to me
why I'm the one in the dirt...

434
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,945
when I got sore jaws
from three hours of blowin'...

435
00:25:27,483 --> 00:25:33,026
Please, please for the love
of God, finish your sentence.

436
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,620
Let's see, what, uh...

437
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:39,785
What exactly
do we have here?

438
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:40,597
We got...

439
00:25:41,383 --> 00:25:45,936
one, two, three men,
in a bed... spooning?

440
00:25:45,936 --> 00:25:47,505
This is not
what it looks like.

441
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:50,950
This is a, uh... We, um...
What is it, Woody?

442
00:25:51,315 --> 00:25:51,715
Camping.

443
00:25:51,715 --> 00:25:54,314
I'll tell you just exactly
what it is there, Poindexter.

444
00:25:55,145 --> 00:25:57,706
It is four counts
of indecent exposure,

445
00:25:57,943 --> 00:26:01,209
two counts of lewd,
lascivious behavior, and...

446
00:26:02,075 --> 00:26:05,556
one count...
of pure jealousy.

447
00:26:05,556 --> 00:26:08,875
- Huh?
- How you doin'?

448
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:11,204
- Hey, look.
- Whoa, we're not...

449
00:26:11,204 --> 00:26:12,921
Thanks for waking us up,
officer.

450
00:26:13,437 --> 00:26:16,502
- Oh, it was actually...
- I get it. You gotta get goin'.

451
00:26:16,502 --> 00:26:17,985
That's terrific.

452
00:26:18,126 --> 00:26:20,132
So five's a crowd? Is that
what I'm gleaning here?

453
00:26:20,132 --> 00:26:23,152
Five's... uneven number.
Figure it out.

454
00:26:23,487 --> 00:26:26,368
You guys can't see it, can you?
You're too close.

455
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:29,219
You don't realize how lucky
you are to have each other.

456
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:34,251
Oh, daddy... Damn lucky.

457
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,766
- I've always felt so.
- I know what you've felt.

458
00:26:39,721 --> 00:26:41,285
I have too.

459
00:26:53,644 --> 00:26:56,123
- You wearing pants?
- No.

460
00:26:56,123 --> 00:26:59,579
Would you please put some
pants on, for God's sake!

461
00:27:00,641 --> 00:27:02,509
What a nice guy.

462
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:06,826
Mmm. Oh, yeah.

463
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,193
Whoo! Anybody else
gotta take a leak?

464
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:10,973
- No.
- No.

465
00:27:10,973 --> 00:27:13,820
Hey, guys, last
stop for quite a while.

466
00:27:14,912 --> 00:27:17,655
I gotta pee again now.

467
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:08,702
Wow. I can smell them
from here.

468
00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:12,342
Gentlemen,
that's the real deal.

469
00:28:45,803 --> 00:28:46,832
What?

470
00:28:49,827 --> 00:28:51,855
Now, that's "wild"!

471
00:29:15,168 --> 00:29:16,877
Whoa, stop it!

472
00:29:17,168 --> 00:29:18,648
Biker in trouble!

473
00:29:39,817 --> 00:29:41,264
This is awesome!

474
00:29:44,703 --> 00:29:47,513
Ah, thanks for
waiting for me, jerks!

475
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:49,922
Yoo-hoo!

476
00:29:51,054 --> 00:29:53,821
Oh, it's...
Whoa, it's cold!

477
00:29:54,921 --> 00:29:57,558
- What?
- Why are you naked?

478
00:29:57,597 --> 00:30:00,433
We're swimming. Did you guys
keep your skivvies on?

479
00:30:00,433 --> 00:30:02,740
Yeah. There could be
snapping turtles or something in here.

480
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,112
I kept mine on cause I didn't
want it to get dark in here.

481
00:30:06,112 --> 00:30:08,907
I don't know, I thought we were
doin' this wild and free thing.

482
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,401
Yeah, well...

483
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:14,329
More like old and lame,
isn't it?

484
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:17,265
The high guy would've just...
ripped 'em right off, you know,

485
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:19,746
back in the...
back in the day.

486
00:30:19,746 --> 00:30:23,283
- But the day's today, isn't it?
- This isn't necessary.

487
00:30:23,283 --> 00:30:27,295
Yeah, come on.
Come on! Huh?

488
00:30:28,121 --> 00:30:31,667
Now you see what you just started?
You even got Doug out of his drawers.

489
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,920
What the hell,
you know what I mean?

490
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,474
But everybody
keep their distance.

491
00:30:35,474 --> 00:30:38,843
I don't want the whole size thing
to ruin our friendship.

492
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,238
Launching mine.
Over your head, baby.

493
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:43,172
Whew.
You guys are nuts.

494
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:50,934
Come on! Huh?

495
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:55,774
Fine. I will get naked
with my gay friends,

496
00:30:55,774 --> 00:30:59,486
and if any of them look
at my junk, I will kill them.

497
00:31:02,281 --> 00:31:05,227
Gentlemen, these are
the good old days.

498
00:31:12,601 --> 00:31:14,984
Come on, kids!
Come on!

499
00:31:14,984 --> 00:31:17,043
- Whoo!
- Oh, no!

500
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:19,011
Last one in
smells like uncle Eddie!

501
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:20,894
Aw, hell no.

502
00:31:20,894 --> 00:31:24,134
Hope you guys don't mind some company.
Minivan was getting a little crowded.

503
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:27,915
You know, there's a much shallower creek
for kids just up the canyon there a little bit.

504
00:31:27,915 --> 00:31:31,661
Oh, no, my kids like to dive.
Marky, show this guy your dive.

505
00:31:31,662 --> 00:31:32,178
No!

506
00:31:32,178 --> 00:31:34,334
If you put your arms out like this,
he does a backflip right into them.

507
00:31:34,334 --> 00:31:36,642
Don't-don't do that,
it's not a good idea.

508
00:31:36,737 --> 00:31:40,206
Oh... hello.
You gentlemen like potato salad?

509
00:31:40,206 --> 00:31:41,327
We've got extra.

510
00:31:41,327 --> 00:31:43,743
But, uh, you might wanna
eat that way over there.

511
00:31:43,743 --> 00:31:46,184
Uh, less ants and snakes.

512
00:31:46,184 --> 00:31:47,512
The kids are comin'.
The kids are comin'.

513
00:31:47,512 --> 00:31:50,309
No, no... Oh, oh. Guys, guys,
you can't swim over here.

514
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:52,497
Crawfish, big crawfish,
they're snapping... Ah, ah...!

515
00:31:52,497 --> 00:31:53,426
Crawfish!

516
00:31:54,236 --> 00:31:56,256
Lemme see
if I can catch one!

517
00:31:57,414 --> 00:31:59,207
See? He's looking
for crawfish!

518
00:31:59,207 --> 00:32:00,976
- I told you!
- He's gonna find a couple of them!

519
00:32:00,976 --> 00:32:02,111
Where is he?

520
00:32:07,671 --> 00:32:10,275
Marky! Cooper! Ava!

521
00:32:10,394 --> 00:32:12,826
Let's, uh, let's get
out of the water. Find a new spot.

522
00:32:12,826 --> 00:32:14,930
Why, Hugh?
This is such a nice...

523
00:32:16,762 --> 00:32:18,130
Oh, my God.

524
00:32:19,028 --> 00:32:21,848
- I didn't wanna do this.
- Out of the water! Now!

525
00:32:21,848 --> 00:32:23,243
Kids, listen to your dad.

526
00:32:23,243 --> 00:32:25,250
- No!
- Aw! We just got here!

527
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:28,521
Get out of the damn water, now!
Run! Run! Run! Go!

528
00:32:28,521 --> 00:32:29,727
Come on! Come on!

529
00:32:29,727 --> 00:32:32,082
What's wrong with these people?
Come on, go!

530
00:32:32,127 --> 00:32:35,063
I'll bet her potato salad
was really good.

531
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:39,356
- Maybe we should go.
- Yeah, let's go.

532
00:32:39,356 --> 00:32:40,943
Why?
They ain't coming back!

533
00:32:43,018 --> 00:32:46,525
Fellas!
Forget about them!

534
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:49,857
More room for us, huh?
Come on!

535
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:53,740
You like what you see?
Huh? Let's get involved!

536
00:32:59,714 --> 00:33:03,311
Whoo! Now that's
what I'm talkin' about!

537
00:33:03,311 --> 00:33:04,465
Whoo!

538
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,372
I saw your bikes
over there and I...

539
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:11,174
Chicken fights, fellas?

540
00:33:12,472 --> 00:33:15,074
No? Plan B.

541
00:33:16,569 --> 00:33:18,528
- Marco...
- Polo.

542
00:33:18,528 --> 00:33:21,705
Mar... Marco...

543
00:33:24,094 --> 00:33:25,495
Marco!

544
00:33:51,753 --> 00:33:53,219
Thank you so much!

545
00:33:53,219 --> 00:33:56,142
And, uh, I left
a... window open, all right?

546
00:34:35,503 --> 00:34:38,957
Oh, yeah.
Now, this is a biker bar.

547
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,602
I'm buying, let's go.

548
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:47,041
Hope they've bran muffins.
I'm a little bound up.

549
00:34:52,081 --> 00:34:53,895
My damn leg's asleep!

550
00:34:54,113 --> 00:34:55,895
Oh, it's got an emblem, too.
An FLH emblem.

551
00:34:55,895 --> 00:34:58,121
That is rare, man. Rare.

552
00:34:58,121 --> 00:35:01,429
- Can you see this?
- Oh, man. That's beautiful.

553
00:35:02,147 --> 00:35:04,995
- What's wrong with you?
- My legs are asleep.

554
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:20,276
- How 'bout this one?
- Yeah.

555
00:35:23,787 --> 00:35:24,836
You guys want beers?

556
00:35:25,232 --> 00:35:27,547
I gotta find that guy with the
'55 bike, man. It is beautiful.

557
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:33,341
Ooh. Nice tat.
Where'd you get it?

558
00:35:33,705 --> 00:35:36,593
Leavenworth.
You?

559
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,772
Meadow Hills Galleria.

560
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:48,296
I don't think I've ever seen
you guys around here before.

561
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:50,264
What's your, uh...

562
00:35:50,727 --> 00:35:53,240
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Wild Hogs.

563
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,998
That the name
of your little gang?

564
00:35:54,998 --> 00:35:58,074
It's not a gang. We're just friends
riding from Cincinnati to the coast.

565
00:35:58,074 --> 00:36:00,526
Hey, man.
We in your seats?

566
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:02,096
- No.
- Nah, cause we could just...

567
00:36:02,096 --> 00:36:04,836
No. No, no,
n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-no.

568
00:36:04,836 --> 00:36:09,209
- ...we'll roll out.
- No, n-n-no. No. I insist. Sit.

569
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,019
- Sit?
- Sit. I insist.

570
00:36:11,268 --> 00:36:13,157
I think I'm gonna
join you fellas.

571
00:36:13,157 --> 00:36:14,180
Actually, we have a...

572
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:17,181
Yeah,
let's join 'em.

573
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:21,320
Make ourselves some
nice new little friends.

574
00:36:21,645 --> 00:36:22,498
- Nice patch.
- Yeah.

575
00:36:22,498 --> 00:36:25,187
Did you get your grandmother
to needlepoint that for you?

576
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:28,498
Well, what's... what's going on
with you there, uh, Cochise?

577
00:36:28,498 --> 00:36:30,217
What's your story?

578
00:36:38,249 --> 00:36:40,453
What is that
supposed to be? Is he blind?

579
00:36:40,453 --> 00:36:42,699
He wasn't when
he walked in here.

580
00:36:42,966 --> 00:36:44,319
Hey! I'm talkin' to you!

581
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:47,136
- You hear me?
- He can hear fine.

582
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:49,362
Look, we're...
We don't want any trouble.

583
00:36:51,413 --> 00:36:52,993
I do.

584
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:57,052
Actually, that's what
I'm... looking forward to the most.

585
00:36:58,448 --> 00:37:00,438
That's what he's
looking forward to!

586
00:37:00,517 --> 00:37:03,680
I heard him say that.
I heard him.

587
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,243
Shut up.

588
00:37:09,899 --> 00:37:11,308
A'it, then.

589
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:14,513
You're looking for trouble?

590
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:18,937
You gotta be careful
about Bobby here.

591
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:20,665
His temper's like
a Roman candle.

592
00:37:20,665 --> 00:37:22,591
Man...
That's a damn lie!

593
00:37:23,447 --> 00:37:25,866
On the other hand,
Woody over here,

594
00:37:25,866 --> 00:37:28,926
you get him mad,
people get broke.

595
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,792
Doug makes kids cry.

596
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:34,702
- What?
- Yeah. You make kids cry.

597
00:37:34,702 --> 00:37:36,115
You made my child cry.

598
00:37:36,115 --> 00:37:38,277
Your kid was crying
before she got to me.

599
00:37:38,277 --> 00:37:41,089
Oh, yeah. But I asked you
to give her a lollipop. Be...

600
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:42,309
- It calms her down.
- You can't give a lolli...

601
00:37:42,309 --> 00:37:44,963
- All right, shut up!
- You know what?

602
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:47,250
I think we better
get out of here.

603
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,985
No. We'll get
out of here at sundown.

604
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,936
After we've had
our beverage.

605
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:55,028
Sundown, Hoss?
What?

606
00:37:55,138 --> 00:37:59,798
These are on me. You got
the mocha lattes yesterday.

607
00:37:59,798 --> 00:38:01,322
- Ah...
- Hey, brother.

608
00:38:03,756 --> 00:38:06,399
- Another Wild Hog!
- Yep.

609
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:09,996
Yep-er-oonie.
That's our gang.

610
00:38:10,266 --> 00:38:13,855
Hey, uh, who owns that
'48 Panhead outside?

611
00:38:13,855 --> 00:38:17,564
- That's my '48.
- Sweet ride.

612
00:38:17,564 --> 00:38:21,389
I'm sick of it. How 'bout
a trade there, brother?

613
00:38:21,389 --> 00:38:23,908
- Dudley. Dudley, Dudley.
- Oh. I wish.

614
00:38:23,908 --> 00:38:26,945
I'm just on a Sportster.
It's worth half of what yours is.

615
00:38:26,945 --> 00:38:29,060
A Sportster?
I grew up on a Sportster!

616
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,065
I've been wanting
another Sportster!

617
00:38:31,065 --> 00:38:33,055
No, no, no.
It's even better than that.

618
00:38:33,055 --> 00:38:35,581
In the gas tank
is one of my shoelaces.

619
00:38:35,581 --> 00:38:39,079
I dropped it in there when I was
trying to get my calculator watch out.

620
00:38:39,864 --> 00:38:41,146
- Dudley?
- Dudley.

621
00:38:41,146 --> 00:38:43,745
Dudley...
You got a deal.

622
00:38:43,745 --> 00:38:47,321
- Seriously? You're serious?
- Think about it. He's not gonna trade the bike.

623
00:38:47,737 --> 00:38:49,931
Dudley, I wanna see
what you look like on that.

624
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:50,449
You're on.

625
00:38:50,449 --> 00:38:53,178
Ah! Dudley!
Dudley, no. No, wait a minute.

626
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:56,967
Yo, check this out.

627
00:38:56,967 --> 00:39:00,348
Does anybody else get
that "pre-rape" feeling?

628
00:39:00,497 --> 00:39:01,822
I do.

629
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,389
Oh, oh, this is great!

630
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:12,327
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This is Joker's Panhead.

631
00:39:12,327 --> 00:39:13,757
I thought we were
talking about this one.

632
00:39:13,757 --> 00:39:15,526
Hey, your Panhead
is over here.

633
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:17,923
Oh. I was talking about...

634
00:39:18,388 --> 00:39:20,964
Nah, no, no, no, no.
I got a better one for you.

635
00:39:21,785 --> 00:39:24,438
It's right over here.
The red one, the Panhead.

636
00:39:24,728 --> 00:39:26,195
- Where?
- Right there.

637
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:27,791
That's a Panhead.
There're no other Panheads.

638
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:29,304
- That?
- Yeah.

639
00:39:29,304 --> 00:39:34,030
- That's a pile of junk.
- Yeah. That's your pile of junk.

640
00:39:39,162 --> 00:39:41,194
- He's just joking you.
- You wanna know the joke?

641
00:39:41,194 --> 00:39:44,000
The joke is suburban assholes
who buy leather outfits

642
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,595
who think they're bikers.
And it's a joke that I'm damn sick of.

643
00:39:47,595 --> 00:39:50,554
You wanna know who
a real biker is? Damien Blade.

644
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,258
He founded the Del Fuegos
and he built this bar

645
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:55,444
for real bikers, not this!

646
00:39:55,444 --> 00:39:57,067
Hey, we have a right
to be bikers.

647
00:39:57,067 --> 00:39:59,795
You don't have any rights.
Shut up! I knew you assholes

648
00:39:59,795 --> 00:40:02,723
the minute I laid eyes on you.
Look at the four of you!

649
00:40:02,723 --> 00:40:04,803
- You don't... you don't know us.
- You don't think I know you?

650
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:07,500
What? You're probably a...
a podiatrist

651
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,712
or a ear-nose-and-throat specialist.

652
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,173
- I wish.
- Orthodontist?

653
00:40:12,387 --> 00:40:14,478
Oh. Close enough.

654
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:17,374
And you, Bobby,
guaranteed you're henpecked.

655
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:20,618
- Right? Your wife wears the pants.
- You know my wife?

656
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:22,942
And you,
you anal-retentive wimp,

657
00:40:23,342 --> 00:40:25,412
guarantee
you bag your own shit.

658
00:40:25,621 --> 00:40:27,578
Wow, you're good.

659
00:40:27,578 --> 00:40:29,738
- What color am I thinking of?
- Shut up.

660
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:32,939
You're the biggest
poser of them all,

661
00:40:33,484 --> 00:40:35,418
aren't you, squinty?

662
00:40:35,986 --> 00:40:38,822
Go home. Just go home.

663
00:40:38,822 --> 00:40:40,824
Go home. You couldn't
handle this freedom anyhow.

664
00:40:40,824 --> 00:40:43,649
Get out of here.
Go back to your safe little lives.

665
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,255
All right, guys, let's get
our bikes. We'll get out of here.

666
00:40:45,255 --> 00:40:48,190
You're not listening to what I'm sayin'.
I'm taking your friend's bike

667
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,509
and you guys are gonna
hit the road and go back

668
00:40:50,509 --> 00:40:52,976
to wherever the hell it is that
you came from. Do you understand?

669
00:40:52,976 --> 00:40:55,928
I'm just saying we're gonna
have to work something out.

670
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:59,183
All right.
Let's work something out.

671
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,862
Hey! What's going on?
Something break?

672
00:41:17,607 --> 00:41:20,516
- What's up, man? What's up?
- This is bullshit, man.

673
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:22,282
We should go back there
and get Dudley's bike.

674
00:41:22,282 --> 00:41:24,704
That's why we're stopping?
What are you, nuts?

675
00:41:24,704 --> 00:41:26,600
What we're gonna do is
call the police.

676
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,162
I gotta borrow
somebody's cell phone.

677
00:41:28,162 --> 00:41:30,090
Einstein had us
throw ours away, remember?

678
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,030
Hey, look, man,
damn the bike.

679
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:34,173
He's just gonna have to roll
with that little sidecar.

680
00:41:34,173 --> 00:41:36,473
- Right.
- Let's just-just get up outta here, man.

681
00:41:36,473 --> 00:41:40,842
Oh, come on. The trip is over cause
some tattooed bullies pushed us around?

682
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:41,986
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

683
00:41:42,965 --> 00:41:45,776
- I go where you go.
- Good. See? He's got balls.

684
00:41:45,776 --> 00:41:48,297
No. I mean my sidecar's
attached to your bike.

685
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:51,064
I'd rather turn back.
But, honestly, how far could I roll?

686
00:41:51,064 --> 00:41:52,600
I'm not gonna
let this happen to him.

687
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,718
I say we go back
and we get his bike.

688
00:41:54,718 --> 00:41:55,776
- You?
- Yeah.

689
00:41:55,776 --> 00:41:59,603
Who died and elected you pope? This isn't
about Dudley, is it? This is about you.

690
00:41:59,603 --> 00:42:01,866
You, you, you. All through high school
it's always about you,

691
00:42:01,866 --> 00:42:04,278
- and I am sick of it!
- Oh, screw you, Doug.

692
00:42:04,278 --> 00:42:05,895
It's not my fault
you hate your life.

693
00:42:05,895 --> 00:42:08,931
- I love my life. Why do you...?
- Let me tell you something!

694
00:42:08,931 --> 00:42:11,003
This trip was supposed
to be about adventure!

695
00:42:11,003 --> 00:42:14,377
But no. You're too busy dragging
your baggage around to let that happen.

696
00:42:14,377 --> 00:42:16,273
Well, thank you, dr. Freud.

697
00:42:16,273 --> 00:42:18,225
Look, I'm not going back
to get that bike

698
00:42:18,225 --> 00:42:21,078
to satisfy your bruised ego.
Are you guys with me?

699
00:42:21,078 --> 00:42:23,427
- Oh, I'm with you.
- Yeah, I agree.

700
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,874
There you go, Woody.
We're not going back there with you.

701
00:42:27,038 --> 00:42:29,666
- Should we go after 'im?
- Probably.

702
00:42:29,943 --> 00:42:32,255
- Are we going to?
- Nope.

703
00:43:30,836 --> 00:43:33,841
Come after us now...
assholes.

704
00:43:53,183 --> 00:43:56,216
- I'll be a son of a gun.
- Oh, snap!

705
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:59,289
You did it!
You got her back!

706
00:43:59,289 --> 00:44:01,914
- Woo-hoo!
- Ha-ha!

707
00:44:02,005 --> 00:44:02,767
Who's your daddy?!

708
00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:05,408
- You are my daddy!
- Yeah, that's right, baby.

709
00:44:05,408 --> 00:44:07,162
Aw, man!

710
00:44:07,455 --> 00:44:09,741
- Thank you!
- How'd you do it?

711
00:44:09,745 --> 00:44:12,419
Okay, they were
totally pissed off.

712
00:44:12,419 --> 00:44:14,608
So I take a new tact.
Reality.

713
00:44:14,608 --> 00:44:17,206
So I said to 'em
"Okay, assault us. No problem.

714
00:44:17,512 --> 00:44:19,194
Because we may not be
real bikers,

715
00:44:19,194 --> 00:44:21,871
but we know real lawyers.
And as soon as you touch us,

716
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,373
we'll sue you for everything
you got and everything

717
00:44:24,373 --> 00:44:26,177
you're gonna have."
And they backed down.

718
00:44:26,177 --> 00:44:28,702
They totally backed down.
It was awesome.

719
00:44:28,942 --> 00:44:30,892
- You really said that?
- Yeah!

720
00:44:31,249 --> 00:44:32,156
My man!

721
00:44:32,156 --> 00:44:33,581
- Yeah!
- Show me... show me love.

722
00:44:33,581 --> 00:44:34,929
Show me love.

723
00:44:34,929 --> 00:44:37,505
Hey, guess what.
The trip's back on.

724
00:44:37,505 --> 00:44:39,197
- It's back on!
- The trip is on!

725
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:41,142
Wait. We're gonna
go back that way, then?

726
00:44:41,142 --> 00:44:42,457
Yeah, they don't care.

727
00:44:42,708 --> 00:44:45,878
We should just, you know, do it
before they change their minds.

728
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,207
- Pacific Ocean, here we come!
- Whoo!

729
00:45:01,945 --> 00:45:05,458
Son of a bitch.
Come on. Come on!

730
00:45:23,753 --> 00:45:25,517
Thanks, guys!

731
00:45:31,132 --> 00:45:33,554
Those assholes got balls.

732
00:45:33,554 --> 00:45:36,379
That I'm gonna... put
in my mouth and chew on!

733
00:45:37,807 --> 00:45:39,837
You're gonna put what
in your mouth?

734
00:45:42,672 --> 00:45:44,730
Come on, Del Fuegos,
let's smoke those hogs!

735
00:45:45,384 --> 00:45:47,002
- Let's go!
- Come on!

736
00:45:56,895 --> 00:45:59,232
What the hell...?
Aw, shit!

737
00:45:59,267 --> 00:46:01,748
Fire, fire!
Fire, everybody.

738
00:46:01,748 --> 00:46:03,499
Hey! Fire,
come on, get off!

739
00:46:03,499 --> 00:46:05,607
Fire, fire!
Get away. Come on.

740
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:09,953
Get out of there!
Get out of there!

741
00:46:25,514 --> 00:46:27,622
Holy shit!

742
00:46:29,217 --> 00:46:32,151
Oh, God. Oh, no.

743
00:46:35,217 --> 00:46:36,483
Come on. Let's go!

744
00:46:36,483 --> 00:46:39,212
What's your rush?
My balls are still vibrating.

745
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:40,874
It's... It's the open road, man.

746
00:46:40,874 --> 00:46:42,584
It's ridin' free,
that's the rush.

747
00:46:42,584 --> 00:46:44,742
This isn't freedom,
this is a gas station!

748
00:46:44,742 --> 00:46:47,424
Built by the man!
A prison for our souls!

749
00:46:47,424 --> 00:46:49,167
My soul needs
something to drink.

750
00:46:49,167 --> 00:46:50,285
I need gas.

751
00:46:50,285 --> 00:46:51,759
We'll get gas
at the next station.

752
00:46:51,759 --> 00:46:54,612
Come on, Wild Hogs.
Let's go!

753
00:46:54,832 --> 00:46:57,556
Whoo-hoo! Let's ride!

754
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,074
Did I miss the espresso stop?

755
00:47:00,848 --> 00:47:02,337
He's moving.

756
00:47:03,069 --> 00:47:05,002
Yahoo!

757
00:47:27,031 --> 00:47:28,983
Woody!
You're an asshole.

758
00:47:28,983 --> 00:47:30,646
They should've had
a sign that said

759
00:47:30,646 --> 00:47:33,188
"Last gas...
X amount of miles."

760
00:47:38,061 --> 00:47:42,951
I need... somethin' to drink.
I'm thirsty... Or else I'm-a die!

761
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:47,567
You know, I keep... saving my spit
so it's like a drink of water,

762
00:47:47,567 --> 00:47:50,359
and it just keeps
tasting like my... my spit.

763
00:47:50,992 --> 00:47:52,104
They say you can get

764
00:47:52,104 --> 00:47:55,100
something to drink
out of a cactus. Right?

765
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:56,759
Where are the cactuses?

766
00:47:56,972 --> 00:48:00,055
We're in a desert
that don't have no damn cactuses.

767
00:48:00,055 --> 00:48:00,908
Yeah.

768
00:48:01,001 --> 00:48:05,138
Actually, I think
when it's plural, it's "cacti".

769
00:48:05,138 --> 00:48:07,504
- I'm killing 'im.
- You're gonna kill 'im?

770
00:48:07,504 --> 00:48:10,320
Hey, we're all thinking it, okay?
We gonna need the nourishment.

771
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,747
He'll put up
the least struggle.

772
00:48:11,747 --> 00:48:14,059
- Move out of the way.
- You love Dudley.

773
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:16,512
It's the sun.
It's making us all crazy.

774
00:48:16,512 --> 00:48:19,774
You're right, man.
My-my-my bad, Dud.

775
00:48:19,774 --> 00:48:22,035
You know, I don't know
what came over me.

776
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:25,879
Dehydration. Your blood's thickening,
so your heart's working harder

777
00:48:25,879 --> 00:48:28,724
to pump it through your... arteries.
Less gets to your head.

778
00:48:28,724 --> 00:48:30,850
Our bodies are literally
trying to drink themselves.

779
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,283
All right.
I'm killing 'im.

780
00:48:32,727 --> 00:48:35,256
Guys, wait a minute. Look,
they got a sign up here. Look!

781
00:48:35,305 --> 00:48:37,392
Curve of the road.
Read it!

782
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:40,142
- Madrid? Spain?
- No. It's Madrid.

783
00:48:40,142 --> 00:48:42,132
That's what the locals say.
I Googled it.

784
00:48:42,132 --> 00:48:45,242
Gonna be water,
food and gas...

785
00:48:45,908 --> 00:48:49,261
- We're gonna live.
- We gonna live!

786
00:48:49,261 --> 00:48:51,950
We gonna live, baby!

787
00:48:55,548 --> 00:48:59,783
- It's closed!
- Ah, man! It's closed!

788
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:01,950
But the diner up here...

789
00:49:02,012 --> 00:49:05,006
The diner's open!
Come on!

790
00:49:06,644 --> 00:49:07,955
Get me a drink, quick!

791
00:49:07,955 --> 00:49:09,791
- We need water!
- Quick!

792
00:49:10,093 --> 00:49:12,680
- Hey! Come on!
- Right here. Right here!

793
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:13,329
Whoa!

794
00:49:13,329 --> 00:49:16,591
- Oh! Right here! Me!
- Me! Me!

795
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:17,852
- You?
- Me!

796
00:49:17,852 --> 00:49:18,610
- Hey!
- You!

797
00:49:24,884 --> 00:49:27,974
They just were here three weeks ago
and they're already getting violent.

798
00:49:28,217 --> 00:49:31,061
It's okay, I got it.

799
00:49:35,197 --> 00:49:37,898
- You gentlemen like a seat?
- Is there a booth open?

800
00:49:38,046 --> 00:49:39,296
Let's go!

801
00:49:39,655 --> 00:49:41,886
- Oh, yeah. Uh, what?
- Come on.

802
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:45,161
- Keep moving!
- Uh, nice town.

803
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:53,567
So, uh, I...

804
00:49:54,778 --> 00:49:56,106
Uh...

805
00:50:03,201 --> 00:50:06,943
- She is perfect.
- You like the waitress?

806
00:50:07,303 --> 00:50:09,982
Oh, man. I wanted to say
something funny to her,

807
00:50:09,982 --> 00:50:12,444
but all I could think
of was black jokes.

808
00:50:12,915 --> 00:50:16,037
- Like which ones?
- I forget.

809
00:50:16,037 --> 00:50:20,108
Why don't you tell the one that ends
with you getting your ass whupped?

810
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,596
- Would that be funny?
- I'll be laughing.

811
00:50:22,596 --> 00:50:24,296
Oh, I'll be cracking up.

812
00:50:27,303 --> 00:50:29,724
Oh, it's the law. Oh, boy.

813
00:50:35,398 --> 00:50:38,214
- You boys here for the Chili Festival?
- What, you have a problem?

814
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:41,482
You look like you just saw
something explode or something in that area.

815
00:50:41,482 --> 00:50:43,024
We're just passing through, man.

816
00:50:43,024 --> 00:50:46,853
The people around here
don't want any more trouble.

817
00:50:46,853 --> 00:50:49,374
And me, I got no problem
with you Del Fuegos

818
00:50:49,374 --> 00:50:51,522
as long as you boys
could stay sober...

819
00:50:51,522 --> 00:50:54,973
No, no. No, we're... we're not
associated with those assholes.

820
00:50:54,973 --> 00:50:56,469
- You're not?
- No.

821
00:50:56,469 --> 00:50:58,189
- For real?
- Yeah.

822
00:50:59,325 --> 00:51:01,974
Folks,
they're not Del Fuegos.

823
00:51:03,567 --> 00:51:05,919
Are the Del Fuegos
a problem around here?

824
00:51:05,919 --> 00:51:08,811
Only if you expect 'em
to pay for a meal they just ate

825
00:51:08,811 --> 00:51:10,120
or a beer they just drank.

826
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,419
- Well, you on't have problems with us.
- No, no. No.

827
00:51:12,419 --> 00:51:15,490
- Then welcome to Madrid.
- Excuse me, sheriff?

828
00:51:15,681 --> 00:51:17,693
- Uh, the Del Fuegos?
- Yeah.

829
00:51:17,693 --> 00:51:21,332
Okay, now. Now, how often might
they... come through this town?

830
00:51:21,744 --> 00:51:23,276
Oh, once every few months.

831
00:51:23,276 --> 00:51:24,710
- Oh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

832
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:27,382
And-and, uh, the gas station,
now when would that be open?

833
00:51:27,382 --> 00:51:30,072
That's closed on Sundays.
So tomorrow morning.

834
00:51:30,072 --> 00:51:30,887
Oh, God.

835
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:34,877
But, you know, maybe you should
seriously consider spending the night.

836
00:51:34,877 --> 00:51:38,146
Because we're having
the world's hottest chili contest.

837
00:51:38,146 --> 00:51:40,961
The Chili Festival is not
something you wanna miss.

838
00:51:40,961 --> 00:51:44,093
Last year, somebody's throat
actually started to bleed.

839
00:51:44,093 --> 00:51:47,709
Oh, damn!
Somebody's throat started to bleed?

840
00:51:47,709 --> 00:51:49,357
Yeah. Changed their life.

841
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:52,067
It's great.
Think about it.

842
00:51:53,843 --> 00:51:57,037
We gotta get out of this town, man.
This town is a drag. We gotta move on.

843
00:51:57,037 --> 00:51:59,184
- We gotta find a way out.
- Woody, chill out, man.

844
00:51:59,184 --> 00:52:01,012
We finally get a chance
to relax.

845
00:52:01,012 --> 00:52:03,159
Yeah. And being able
to use a bathroom,

846
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:06,557
- that might be a good idea.
- And I can empty my poop bag.

847
00:52:06,557 --> 00:52:08,204
You gonna
re-use the bag?

848
00:52:08,204 --> 00:52:10,339
Woody, remember
the theme of this trip?

849
00:52:10,339 --> 00:52:12,056
"Whatever", remember?
"Whatever."

850
00:52:12,056 --> 00:52:13,419
Okay, fine! Fine.

851
00:52:13,419 --> 00:52:16,157
We'll stay the night and then
we'll get gas in the morning. Okay?

852
00:52:16,157 --> 00:52:19,018
Calm down. I just don't understand
what your rush is.

853
00:52:19,272 --> 00:52:21,846
I'm not in a rush, man.
I just wanna ride, man.

854
00:52:21,846 --> 00:52:23,055
I just wanna ride.
You know?

855
00:52:23,055 --> 00:52:25,648
Ride, Sally, ride!

856
00:52:25,648 --> 00:52:29,380
You are so weird. He asks the...
You say the weirdest things, man.

857
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:32,655
You're just like "We're digging the roots,
buying real estate and shit."

858
00:52:32,655 --> 00:52:35,646
Yeah. Why don't you just...

859
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:37,952
What?! What?

860
00:52:45,986 --> 00:52:47,628
All right,
everybody come here.

861
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,111
Come on.

862
00:52:51,995 --> 00:52:53,108
All right.

863
00:52:54,626 --> 00:52:56,205
We're here. Right?

864
00:52:56,205 --> 00:52:59,421
They could be in any of these towns
by now. Right around here. A'it?

865
00:52:59,421 --> 00:53:01,158
We're gonna find them,
we're gonna get 'em.

866
00:53:01,394 --> 00:53:02,662
I don't know, Jack.

867
00:53:02,662 --> 00:53:05,737
I mean, by my calculations,
I'm-I'm thinking, you know,

868
00:53:05,737 --> 00:53:07,665
if they're... four hours
ahead of us...

869
00:53:07,665 --> 00:53:11,264
Shut up! Anybody else wanna
tell me how hard this is gonna be?

870
00:53:11,372 --> 00:53:13,871
Huh? Are there
any other naysayers?

871
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:17,524
Good. I want you to
break up into two-man teams.

872
00:53:17,762 --> 00:53:19,844
You call me
when you find 'em.

873
00:53:51,141 --> 00:53:54,499
Oh, snap.
A softball pitch.

874
00:53:54,697 --> 00:53:56,801
You-you... I gotta win
somethin' for my girls.

875
00:53:57,066 --> 00:53:58,706
Wait a minute.
You think you're good at this?

876
00:53:58,706 --> 00:53:59,979
Oh, I know
I'm good at this.

877
00:53:59,979 --> 00:54:03,570
Hey, on my Little League team,
they used to call me "Bull's Eye Bobby".

878
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:05,296
- Yeah.
- Cause I had pinpoint control.

879
00:54:05,296 --> 00:54:05,764
Right.

880
00:54:05,764 --> 00:54:09,274
A hundred and forty-four innings,
and never walked a single batter, baby.

881
00:54:09,424 --> 00:54:11,252
Watch me work, baby.

882
00:54:11,447 --> 00:54:12,140
- Here you go.
- How you doin'?

883
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:13,259
- All right. Good luck.
- Thank you.

884
00:54:13,259 --> 00:54:15,000
All right,
Bull's Eye Bobby, folks!

885
00:54:18,025 --> 00:54:20,439
Bull's Eye Bobby, baby.

886
00:54:21,557 --> 00:54:24,390
It's probably been, what?
Twenty-eight years, Bulls Eye?

887
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:33,546
- Hey.
- Hi.

888
00:54:34,154 --> 00:54:35,764
So, um...

889
00:54:37,837 --> 00:54:39,580
- Excuse me?
- Never mind.

890
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:43,392
- So you like chili?
- Oh, yeah. Not the hot stuff.

891
00:54:43,392 --> 00:54:45,406
But you put a nice,
mild turkey chili in front of me?

892
00:54:45,406 --> 00:54:47,521
Oh, yeah,
I'm gonna eat it.

893
00:54:47,521 --> 00:54:50,109
That's too bad, cause
I wanted you to try mine, but...

894
00:54:50,109 --> 00:54:51,682
- it's pretty hot.
- No, I'll try it!

895
00:54:51,682 --> 00:54:55,595
I like your kinda hot. The...
In your chili. The chili hot. Food hot.

896
00:54:55,595 --> 00:54:58,937
That's the kinda hot
I wanna kiss. Eat.

897
00:55:00,264 --> 00:55:01,916
Okay. If you're sure
you can handle it.

898
00:55:01,916 --> 00:55:04,248
Handle it? I'm a biker.

899
00:55:04,809 --> 00:55:06,596
- What's you call him?
- Bull's Eye Bobby!

900
00:55:06,596 --> 00:55:08,469
Bull's Eye Bobby, baby.

901
00:55:08,483 --> 00:55:10,293
- Yeah, Bull's Eye.
- Ha-ha-ha!

902
00:55:10,631 --> 00:55:11,573
Yep.

903
00:55:13,783 --> 00:55:14,899
Oh...

904
00:55:17,138 --> 00:55:20,064
- I guess that counts as a walk?
- I'm gonna sit.

905
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:40,542
Mmm.

906
00:55:40,803 --> 00:55:45,745
Smooth. Tasty.
Little... spice.

907
00:55:45,745 --> 00:55:47,914
It gets a little hotter
as it sits in your throat down there.

908
00:55:50,268 --> 00:55:51,754
You okay?

909
00:55:53,015 --> 00:55:55,198
You want some of this?
It'll cool you down.

910
00:55:59,641 --> 00:56:01,845
Don't worry, your throat
won't actually bleed.

911
00:56:04,814 --> 00:56:06,223
I understand.

912
00:56:09,231 --> 00:56:12,631
Mother of God!
I swallowed hot lava!

913
00:56:21,043 --> 00:56:22,049
Hundred and
forty-four innings,

914
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:24,051
you never hit anybody
in the crotch like that?

915
00:56:24,051 --> 00:56:26,645
Not on purpose, man,
all right? You all right?

916
00:56:26,645 --> 00:56:30,013
- Yeah, it's... Good fastball.
- Hey. I'd like you boys

917
00:56:30,013 --> 00:56:32,524
to meet my deputies,
Earl and Buck Dooble.

918
00:56:32,524 --> 00:56:35,065
- How are you, Earl?
- I'm Earl. He's Buck.

919
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:36,863
- Earl, Buck.
- Now, just remember:

920
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:40,801
Brother with the word "ear" in
his name has got both on his head.

921
00:56:42,227 --> 00:56:44,847
See, I can only say that
cause I'm on his right side,

922
00:56:44,847 --> 00:56:47,933
which, as you can see,
is mostly blown off.

923
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:49,971
- You say something, Earl?
- No, I did not.

924
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:53,437
Needless to say,
we don't carry firearms anymore.

925
00:56:53,609 --> 00:56:55,674
I mean, sometimes
you pull 'em out,

926
00:56:55,674 --> 00:56:57,935
you think they're not loaded,
and then sometimes...

927
00:56:57,935 --> 00:57:01,214
- They blow your deputy's ear off?
- Yeah.

928
00:57:04,192 --> 00:57:06,388
So, what brings you boys
on this trip, anyway?

929
00:57:06,388 --> 00:57:09,166
Firstly, we had to get away,
okay?

930
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:11,534
And secondly, you know,
you just... never know

931
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,036
how many more summers
you got left.

932
00:57:14,367 --> 00:57:18,296
- Do you?
- Wow. That's deep.

933
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:19,764
I just came on this trip,

934
00:57:19,764 --> 00:57:23,125
you know, hoping to... reclaim
the old Doug, you know?

935
00:57:23,125 --> 00:57:26,418
You know, I know
exactly what you mean.

936
00:57:26,418 --> 00:57:30,202
You know, you can never let life
get too stagnant or too safe.

937
00:57:30,202 --> 00:57:31,751
Every now and then
you gotta do

938
00:57:31,751 --> 00:57:35,130
what we folks around here
like to call "Slap the Bull".

939
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:36,803
What's a "Slapping the Bull"?

940
00:57:36,803 --> 00:57:38,991
That's just
a... little game we play

941
00:57:38,991 --> 00:57:42,061
to make sure your life
is not controlled by fear.

942
00:57:42,061 --> 00:57:43,511
Yeah, I wanna do that.

943
00:57:43,511 --> 00:57:45,858
Oh, come on, guys.
We're exhausted.

944
00:57:45,858 --> 00:57:48,700
I think we should just... put
the bikes in back of the hotel,

945
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:52,545
in a shed with the doors closed,
perhaps, and then... play Scrabble

946
00:57:52,545 --> 00:57:54,848
in the... in the room
with the... with the shades down.

947
00:57:54,848 --> 00:57:58,503
Look, Aunt Bee, maybe you wanna do
something else here in Mayberry.

948
00:57:58,503 --> 00:57:59,020
Yeah.

949
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:03,114
- Hey, Bobby. How 'bout a little Bull Slap?
- That sounds like somethin' I could win at.

950
00:58:03,114 --> 00:58:04,748
- Yeah.
- I-I'll take a little Bull Slap.

951
00:58:04,748 --> 00:58:07,664
Yeah, look, Bull Slap
for everybody. Come on. Line 'em up.

952
00:58:07,664 --> 00:58:09,821
- Let's have a little Bull Slap.
- We'll do it!

953
00:58:11,687 --> 00:58:13,798
So literally,
we're gonna slap a bull?

954
00:58:13,989 --> 00:58:17,938
Yep. Right on the ass. And then you're
gonna wanna hightail it outta there.

955
00:58:17,938 --> 00:58:19,383
- Why?
- Cause he can kill you.

956
00:58:19,383 --> 00:58:20,824
- Mm-hmm.
- Perfect.

957
00:58:20,824 --> 00:58:23,224
Hey, man, I thought
this was a drinking game.

958
00:58:23,224 --> 00:58:25,647
Yeah, you know, you got
a lot of animals I would slap.

959
00:58:25,647 --> 00:58:28,914
But I, you know... A chicken,
I'd slap a chicken or a goat, maybe.

960
00:58:28,914 --> 00:58:30,387
A ferret, I'd slap,
you know?

961
00:58:30,387 --> 00:58:32,731
But I'm not...
I'm not gonna slap a bull.

962
00:58:32,731 --> 00:58:35,644
Oh, come on, Doug.
It was your idea. Get in there!

963
00:58:35,644 --> 00:58:38,087
I didn't know we had to slap so...
Look at the nuts on that thing!

964
00:58:38,087 --> 00:58:38,870
Come on!

965
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:41,335
- It's not safe, Woody.
- It's not safe. You know what?

966
00:58:41,335 --> 00:58:44,058
- You snooze, you lose. I'm going.
- You're gettin' ready to do that?

967
00:58:44,058 --> 00:58:45,634
- Yep!
- Oh!

968
00:58:46,214 --> 00:58:49,540
You jackass. Go ahead, Woody.
Hope you're wearing a cup.

969
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:53,610
- Right on the ass.
- He looks confident.

970
00:58:53,827 --> 00:58:54,948
Easy.

971
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:05,804
Whoa!

972
00:59:06,308 --> 00:59:09,219
Come on, get back, now!

973
00:59:10,816 --> 00:59:12,164
Way to get back!

974
00:59:12,587 --> 00:59:15,307
I just slapped
a big fat bull on the ass!

975
00:59:15,307 --> 00:59:17,350
That was awesome!
Who's next?

976
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,859
- Uh, Doug?
- Doug?

977
00:59:19,859 --> 00:59:21,691
Yeah, no,
that'd be you, yeah.

978
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:23,161
Come on, Doug.
Do it!

979
00:59:23,172 --> 00:59:24,730
You know, it's...
it... you could...

980
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:26,252
That's really an, um...

981
00:59:26,252 --> 00:59:28,107
Doug, go.

982
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,530
- Come on, man!
- Handle your business.

983
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:32,207
- It was easy.
- I'm not gonna...

984
00:59:32,207 --> 00:59:33,985
Yeah, come on! It's fun!

985
00:59:36,071 --> 00:59:37,411
Old days, Doug. Old days.

986
00:59:37,411 --> 00:59:38,892
All right, all right,
I'm gonna slap a bull.

987
00:59:38,892 --> 00:59:42,400
- I'm gonna... slap that bull.
- There you go.

988
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:43,926
- That's my Doug!
- There he goes.

989
00:59:45,581 --> 00:59:47,309
Just slap it right there
on the rear end, huh?

990
00:59:47,734 --> 00:59:50,024
Right on the hind haunches.

991
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:54,061
You know,
this is so good for Doug.

992
00:59:54,061 --> 00:59:56,158
- Actually, it's good for all of us.
- Yeah.

993
00:59:56,158 --> 00:59:58,083
Hey, Charlie, thanks
for bringing us here, man.

994
00:59:58,234 --> 01:00:00,001
Sure. Glad we could help.

995
01:00:00,001 --> 01:00:02,513
Yeah, we never
seen it done twice in a row.

996
01:00:02,513 --> 01:00:03,313
- Mm-mmm.
- What?

997
01:00:03,313 --> 01:00:06,573
I-i-it'll be interesting to see how
the bull takes being slapped

998
01:00:06,573 --> 01:00:07,939
- Mm-hmm.
- ... now that he's alert.

999
01:00:07,939 --> 01:00:08,534
- Mm-hmm.

1000
01:00:09,492 --> 01:00:10,812
Alert?!

1001
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,102
Get back!

1002
01:00:16,278 --> 01:00:17,905
- Hurry!
- Hey! Come on.

1003
01:00:21,483 --> 01:00:22,711
Ow! Ow!

1004
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:25,996
He coming back!

1005
01:00:28,868 --> 01:00:30,004
Bull!

1006
01:00:30,745 --> 01:00:33,335
He coming back!
He coming back! Oh...!

1007
01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:36,957
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Ah! He almost got me!

1008
01:00:36,957 --> 01:00:38,976
Come on! What's this bully want?
Come on, bully!

1009
01:00:38,976 --> 01:00:42,748
You don't wanna use mockery!
That never works!

1010
01:00:42,842 --> 01:00:44,405
Cowboy's in trouble!

1011
01:00:45,247 --> 01:00:47,168
Woody! Maybe if you just
try to reason with...

1012
01:00:47,168 --> 01:00:49,767
- He's coming back for more! Look out!
- Whoa!

1013
01:00:49,767 --> 01:00:53,215
He's more afraid of you
than you are of him!

1014
01:00:53,682 --> 01:00:54,318
Watch out!

1015
01:00:54,425 --> 01:00:56,061
Watch out, watch out.
Come on!

1016
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:58,986
- Come on, let's go, let's go!
- Oh!

1017
01:01:03,425 --> 01:01:04,316
What?!

1018
01:01:04,316 --> 01:01:08,701
- Yeah, man, this is living!
- Yeah, we slapped a bull... in the ass!

1019
01:01:08,701 --> 01:01:09,815
- Yes, sir!
- Yeah!

1020
01:01:10,866 --> 01:01:12,766
Yeah, you sure did.

1021
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:15,665
- You sure did!
- Hey, did y'all see my moves?

1022
01:01:15,665 --> 01:01:18,694
I was shaking and baking,
just like the NFL, baby!

1023
01:01:19,275 --> 01:01:20,315
You hear
what I'm sayin'?

1024
01:01:20,315 --> 01:01:23,614
I delivered it
right to the end zo...!

1025
01:01:42,898 --> 01:01:44,868
- Hey, look at him.
- He threw Bobby ten feet in the air.

1026
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:45,635
It was awful.

1027
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:47,861
Hey, man, that damn bull
kept following me around.

1028
01:01:47,861 --> 01:01:51,437
- You think it was my cologne?
- What are you wearing, uh, Rodeo Clown?

1029
01:01:51,445 --> 01:01:53,209
- Hold on...
- So now you got jokes?

1030
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:55,216
Hey, Woody, you know,

1031
01:01:55,216 --> 01:01:58,057
I apologize for saying you had
ego issues earlier. All right?

1032
01:01:59,085 --> 01:02:00,965
I'm sorry
I called you a pussy.

1033
01:02:02,241 --> 01:02:03,742
You didn't call me a pussy.

1034
01:02:04,496 --> 01:02:07,927
No, not... to your face,
but that's what I was thinking!

1035
01:02:08,207 --> 01:02:11,357
Hey, we're just saying how much fun
this trip's turned out to be.

1036
01:02:11,357 --> 01:02:14,592
I was so close this time!
So close!

1037
01:02:14,592 --> 01:02:16,120
What's the matter, Dudley?

1038
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:18,622
The waitress.
I think she likes me.

1039
01:02:18,622 --> 01:02:20,405
- Good.
- No, it's not good.

1040
01:02:20,405 --> 01:02:22,363
She told me to meet her
on the dance floor.

1041
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:23,892
- So?
- So? Go dance.

1042
01:02:23,892 --> 01:02:27,185
I can't go on the dance floor.
You know what I look like.

1043
01:02:27,497 --> 01:02:30,164
The music moves me,
but it moves me ugly.

1044
01:02:30,164 --> 01:02:32,308
Well, do that... sprinkler thing
you did at my wedding.

1045
01:02:32,308 --> 01:02:34,425
- Yeah, sprinkler.
- No, I can't do the sprinkler.

1046
01:02:34,425 --> 01:02:36,166
I've gotta... I need to...

1047
01:02:38,841 --> 01:02:40,444
- No.
- Yes.

1048
01:02:40,444 --> 01:02:41,575
I said no.

1049
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:44,696
Oh, keep it simple,
why don't we just, uh...

1050
01:02:44,824 --> 01:02:47,964
We'll do the lindy. All right?
I'll be the guy, you be the girl.

1051
01:02:48,066 --> 01:02:50,789
There we go.
And it's just... Remember?

1052
01:02:50,789 --> 01:02:52,707
- Okay. Yeah, right.
- It's one and two

1053
01:02:52,707 --> 01:02:55,771
and three and four,
and turn her around,

1054
01:02:55,771 --> 01:02:57,164
- and start over again.
- Do it two times, and...

1055
01:02:57,164 --> 01:02:59,038
- Whatever you want.
- I'll be the guy.

1056
01:02:59,038 --> 01:03:00,822
- Be the guy, I'll be the girl.
- Ready?

1057
01:03:00,822 --> 01:03:04,627
And... one and two
and three and four.

1058
01:03:04,627 --> 01:03:08,346
One and two and three and four,
and turn me around...

1059
01:03:08,346 --> 01:03:11,031
- Oh, yeah! Now we're...
- Oh, okay, that's enough.

1060
01:03:11,031 --> 01:03:13,025
- That's, uh, good lesson.
- What? No, wait. Is that it?

1061
01:03:13,025 --> 01:03:16,080
- Yeah, that's enough.
- That's just a pocket knife.

1062
01:03:18,134 --> 01:03:20,444
There she is.
You're ready. Go.

1063
01:03:20,444 --> 01:03:22,551
- Yeah, let's do it.
- I'm ready.

1064
01:03:22,551 --> 01:03:25,073
You're ready.
Come on. Go.

1065
01:03:25,073 --> 01:03:26,471
Yeah!

1066
01:03:59,408 --> 01:04:01,731
- Whoo!
- Check it out.

1067
01:04:12,426 --> 01:04:13,780
- Oh!
- Ahh!

1068
01:04:14,052 --> 01:04:15,777
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1069
01:04:18,784 --> 01:04:20,479
- He's panicking.
- He's panicking.

1070
01:04:49,791 --> 01:04:54,506
- Hey! That's my phone!
- Your minutes just expired.

1071
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:59,484
- Baby! Baby, it's Murdock.
- Tell me you found them.

1072
01:04:59,484 --> 01:05:02,231
We did.
They're in Madrid.

1073
01:05:03,052 --> 01:05:05,554
Good! Good, good,
good, good. I like Madrid!

1074
01:05:05,554 --> 01:05:07,594
The ground is soft enough
to bury them in.

1075
01:05:07,594 --> 01:05:09,279
You want us to
smack 'em around a little?

1076
01:05:09,279 --> 01:05:11,347
<i>No! No! No, no, no, no, no.
Listen to me!</i>

1077
01:05:11,347 --> 01:05:13,348
You just make sure
they stay there. Okay?

1078
01:05:13,348 --> 01:05:15,844
But do not touch them.
They're mine.

1079
01:05:15,844 --> 01:05:17,974
I wanna feel their
bones break under my fists.

1080
01:05:17,974 --> 01:05:19,962
Sounds like
a good beating, Jack.

1081
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:21,712
We'll leave 'em
for you, then.

1082
01:05:23,303 --> 01:05:26,045
Anyone else want some
Wild Hog for breakfast?

1083
01:05:26,045 --> 01:05:28,546
Yee-ha!

1084
01:05:33,507 --> 01:05:36,112
You expect me to pay
for this piss-warm beer?

1085
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:38,819
Here, you can have it back.

1086
01:05:43,023 --> 01:05:45,348
If we drank piss,
we'd drink it cold!

1087
01:05:46,723 --> 01:05:47,785
What?!

1088
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:50,860
Wait, guys, guys,
guys, guys, look...

1089
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:52,682
We don't drink piss!

1090
01:05:54,927 --> 01:05:55,815
Hey, hey.

1091
01:05:56,874 --> 01:05:59,320
Hey, Woody. Maybe it's time
to give these guys

1092
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,992
another one
of your famous talks.

1093
01:06:00,992 --> 01:06:04,995
We just avoid them, guys, okay? We...
I-I've handled this legally. We should just go.

1094
01:06:04,995 --> 01:06:07,568
You know what? I'm talking
to these assholes this time, Woody.

1095
01:06:07,568 --> 01:06:08,906
You shouldn't have
to do it twice.

1096
01:06:08,906 --> 01:06:09,385
No!

1097
01:06:09,385 --> 01:06:12,023
You took care of them
the last time, and I just sat there.

1098
01:06:12,023 --> 01:06:15,573
But this time, you know what?
They wanna see rage? Watch me.

1099
01:06:15,573 --> 01:06:17,482
- Bobby, Bob...
- Whoa!

1100
01:06:18,288 --> 01:06:20,039
Hey, assholes!

1101
01:06:20,275 --> 01:06:23,182
You boys got a hell of a lot of trouble
coming. You know that, right?

1102
01:06:23,182 --> 01:06:23,772
I'm gonna tell you again,

1103
01:06:23,772 --> 01:06:28,198
like my friend told your stupid-ass,
cracker-ass, inbred buddies...

1104
01:06:28,198 --> 01:06:29,244
Did he just say "cracker"?

1105
01:06:29,244 --> 01:06:31,151
- "Cracker-ass."
- Oh, perfect.

1106
01:06:31,151 --> 01:06:33,999
You touch us, and we'll
sue your ass so hard,

1107
01:06:33,999 --> 01:06:36,779
you'll be taking out
a loan just to piss.

1108
01:06:36,779 --> 01:06:40,660
Now, if that ain't clear enough
for you, maybe this is: splash.

1109
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:42,636
Huh? Got it?
Did I get it in your mouth?

1110
01:06:42,636 --> 01:06:45,581
Splash! Splash! Splash!
Did I get you on some of that?

1111
01:06:45,581 --> 01:06:47,502
Well, you crossed
a little line right there.

1112
01:06:47,502 --> 01:06:50,349
No, no, no, no, no!
It ain't worth it, man.

1113
01:06:50,428 --> 01:06:51,970
Jack'll kill us
if we touch him.

1114
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:53,905
- So just...
- Yeah, break some of that up.

1115
01:06:53,905 --> 01:06:55,798
Got a little treat for you.

1116
01:06:56,028 --> 01:06:57,920
Huh? Break
a little of that up.

1117
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,750
Can you hear that?
Can you hear that?

1118
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:04,933
Uhh! Uhh!

1119
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:06,733
Uhhh!

1120
01:07:06,733 --> 01:07:09,732
- That's not a discussion.
- No, that's a lawsuit.

1121
01:07:11,979 --> 01:07:15,750
- Aw, look at that.
- What?!

1122
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:19,280
That's gonna stain.

1123
01:07:20,448 --> 01:07:23,107
You boys look like you
belong on a couple of hot dogs.

1124
01:07:24,076 --> 01:07:25,040
Now...

1125
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:29,256
if there's any other Del Fuegos
that need that message repeated,

1126
01:07:29,256 --> 01:07:31,174
you tell 'em
that the Wild Hogs...

1127
01:07:35,046 --> 01:07:36,891
are right here
in Madrid, baby...

1128
01:07:37,162 --> 01:07:41,012
ready to explain it again.
You got that?

1129
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:43,031
I said: you got that?!

1130
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:46,293
Sweet mother of mercy!

1131
01:07:46,979 --> 01:07:47,884
Huh?!

1132
01:07:51,066 --> 01:07:55,284
He don't want it.
He don't want it. I'm hungry.

1133
01:07:56,629 --> 01:07:58,600
Let's evacuate!
Come on!

1134
01:08:02,665 --> 01:08:05,933
- Beer, here!
- Wild Hogs, I gotta tell you,

1135
01:08:05,933 --> 01:08:08,191
you don't know
how many broken windows

1136
01:08:08,191 --> 01:08:09,944
you guys saved this town.

1137
01:08:09,944 --> 01:08:13,141
Sheriff, it's the least we could do
for our new friends here in Madrid.

1138
01:08:13,141 --> 01:08:16,174
- Right, Bobby?
- Wild Hogs!

1139
01:08:16,174 --> 01:08:18,394
Wild Hogs!

1140
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:20,037
That's some good work
you did there, Bobby.

1141
01:08:20,037 --> 01:08:21,562
Hey, thank you, sheriff.

1142
01:08:21,562 --> 01:08:24,485
Now look, you know, if you need
somethin' done, just come to me.

1143
01:08:24,485 --> 01:08:27,629
You know what I mean?
Cause I will beat shit down.

1144
01:08:27,629 --> 01:08:29,486
Let's say them peanuts
are bothering you.

1145
01:08:29,486 --> 01:08:32,278
Huh? Huh? I don't wanna hear it!
I don't wanna hear it!

1146
01:08:32,278 --> 01:08:34,652
What'd the sheriff tell you?
What'd the town people tell you?

1147
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:37,602
What the...?
You know what I mean?

1148
01:08:37,787 --> 01:08:41,072
I ain't got no problem with it, sheriff.
I ain't got... I got no problem with it.

1149
01:08:41,072 --> 01:08:43,877
Yeah. Yeah.
That's all right.

1150
01:08:44,731 --> 01:08:47,693
This is great.
Right, Woody?

1151
01:08:47,693 --> 01:08:50,953
- Huh?
- You all right?

1152
01:08:54,006 --> 01:08:55,235
Yeah...

1153
01:08:56,058 --> 01:08:57,898
- I'm gonna call Kelly.
- Yeah.

1154
01:08:57,966 --> 01:08:59,534
Remind her just what
kind of a stud she married.

1155
01:08:59,534 --> 01:09:02,943
All right,
yeah, you do that.

1156
01:09:06,074 --> 01:09:07,233
Hey, hey, Bobby!

1157
01:09:07,233 --> 01:09:09,631
Next time, I handle
those bozos, eh?

1158
01:09:09,631 --> 01:09:12,354
The wrath of Dudley!
Wild Hogs!

1159
01:09:12,354 --> 01:09:15,188
Wild Hogs!

1160
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:17,537
Tequila, on the Wild Hogs.

1161
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:23,199
In New Mexico.
We actually slapped a bull.

1162
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:25,121
Slapped it right on the ass.

1163
01:09:25,185 --> 01:09:27,215
Doug, you have no idea
how turned on I am right now,

1164
01:09:27,215 --> 01:09:29,552
- but please just be careful.
- Yeah, we're like celebrities here.

1165
01:09:29,552 --> 01:09:32,026
- Well, Bobby is.
- Man, I crush them cashews.

1166
01:09:32,026 --> 01:09:34,134
- Macadamia nuts?
- Oh, macadamia nut?

1167
01:09:34,134 --> 01:09:35,472
I'd kick it out the park.

1168
01:09:35,657 --> 01:09:38,130
Hey! And guess who
dropped by to say hello.

1169
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:40,959
Karen. Yeah, I think
she's feeling a little lonely.

1170
01:09:40,959 --> 01:09:42,698
- Who's that?
- Oh, it's-it's Doug.

1171
01:09:42,698 --> 01:09:44,735
He says they're all having
a great time on the road trip.

1172
01:09:44,735 --> 01:09:46,784
Kelly, don't tell her
about the...

1173
01:09:46,784 --> 01:09:48,431
Road trip?!

1174
01:09:50,676 --> 01:09:53,312
Hey! Dudley,
don't you wanna come inside?

1175
01:09:53,312 --> 01:09:54,868
I'm fine.
I'm just gonna, um,

1176
01:09:55,438 --> 01:09:57,864
sit out here
for... a little while, I think.

1177
01:09:57,864 --> 01:10:00,502
Okay. You okay?

1178
01:10:00,809 --> 01:10:04,000
I'm fine. I'm... uh...

1179
01:10:07,292 --> 01:10:08,622
No, the truth is
I'm not okay.

1180
01:10:08,622 --> 01:10:10,662
The truth is
I like you a lot, Maggie.

1181
01:10:13,716 --> 01:10:15,533
I'm liking you a lot too.

1182
01:10:16,321 --> 01:10:19,584
See, that's... that's
what I was afraid of.

1183
01:10:20,403 --> 01:10:23,061
That you would like me
without knowing...

1184
01:10:23,228 --> 01:10:24,911
Without me telling you...

1185
01:10:28,585 --> 01:10:30,541
I'm not a cool biker,
Maggie.

1186
01:10:31,668 --> 01:10:33,810
I'm not a cool anything.

1187
01:10:34,009 --> 01:10:38,122
I'm a computer programmer.
I'm just a geek.

1188
01:10:39,024 --> 01:10:43,051
I'm sorry if you thought
I was somebody that I'm not.

1189
01:10:49,756 --> 01:10:53,586
Mm-mm. You're not a...
a geek.

1190
01:10:56,708 --> 01:10:59,435
- You're a lot of fun.
- Hmm.

1191
01:11:01,975 --> 01:11:05,195
And you're... really honest.

1192
01:11:07,975 --> 01:11:10,435
You're really sweet.

1193
01:11:13,825 --> 01:11:16,866
You're the kind of guy
that's hard to find.

1194
01:11:24,817 --> 01:11:26,017
Sorry.

1195
01:11:26,854 --> 01:11:29,189
Try again. One more time.

1196
01:11:34,077 --> 01:11:36,402
All right, Bobby!
All gassed up!

1197
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:41,911
- Whoo! All gassed up, baby!
- All right. Let's get Dudley. Let's go!

1198
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:43,957
- Clive, what's up?
- Hey! My man!

1199
01:11:44,032 --> 01:11:45,905
What you know? No good?
All right. Okay, baby.

1200
01:11:45,905 --> 01:11:48,844
Wait a minute. We're going to high altitudes.
I think we should check our tire pressure.

1201
01:11:48,844 --> 01:11:50,499
Ho-ho, no, no, little buddy.

1202
01:11:50,499 --> 01:11:52,776
We gotta ride.
We gotta get going, okay?

1203
01:11:52,776 --> 01:11:55,068
We got new experiences
and new locations, right?

1204
01:11:55,068 --> 01:11:58,037
We can't leave, man.
I'm like the mayor of this town.

1205
01:11:58,037 --> 01:12:01,022
- My people need me.
- I said we're leaving!

1206
01:12:01,729 --> 01:12:03,012
Hey, guys.

1207
01:12:03,183 --> 01:12:04,985
We decided we wanna
have breakfast here.

1208
01:12:04,985 --> 01:12:07,619
Come on! Hey, cowboy!
Let's saddle up, okay?

1209
01:12:07,619 --> 01:12:09,807
You're burning daylight.
Let's go!

1210
01:12:09,807 --> 01:12:11,797
You got a problem with hanging
around this town a few more minutes?

1211
01:12:11,797 --> 01:12:14,090
Do I look like
I have a problem? Do I?

1212
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:15,049
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1213
01:12:15,049 --> 01:12:17,603
Well, there you go again.
Saying the weirdest shit.

1214
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:31,075
Del Fuegos!
Hide the bikes! Quick!

1215
01:12:31,075 --> 01:12:33,294
- Why, why, why?
- Just do it! Trust me!

1216
01:12:33,442 --> 01:12:36,590
What's wrong?
Why are we hiding?

1217
01:12:37,361 --> 01:12:39,554
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1218
01:12:50,694 --> 01:12:53,351
- Holy God!
- Hey! Why are we hiding?

1219
01:12:53,351 --> 01:12:54,831
You took care of this
already, didn't you, Woody?

1220
01:12:54,831 --> 01:12:56,411
No, not like you think,
okay?

1221
01:12:56,411 --> 01:12:58,093
Well, what is it
that I think?

1222
01:12:59,693 --> 01:13:01,434
I didn't really
talk to them, okay?

1223
01:13:01,434 --> 01:13:03,680
- You serious?
- I knew something was wrong.

1224
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:06,569
Dudley, you're like, uh, you're
usually like "I'm all stupid, you know..."

1225
01:13:06,569 --> 01:13:07,623
- It's not Dudley's fault!
- "... take my bike,

1226
01:13:07,623 --> 01:13:09,653
"give me a piece of junk,
I'm happy."

1227
01:13:09,653 --> 01:13:11,949
You guys are all,
"I'm scared. Let's get out of here."

1228
01:13:11,949 --> 01:13:12,600
- Whatever.
- It's our fault?

1229
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,318
Now, the Del Fuegos are all,
"You're nothing, you know."

1230
01:13:15,318 --> 01:13:17,096
- "We're real bikers."
- This isn't about us!

1231
01:13:17,096 --> 01:13:20,003
- What did you do to them?
- What did you do, Woody?

1232
01:13:20,833 --> 01:13:21,808
I...

1233
01:13:23,817 --> 01:13:27,365
I... cut the gas lines
of their bikes.

1234
01:13:27,706 --> 01:13:28,881
Then I...

1235
01:13:29,237 --> 01:13:32,202
- What?
- Maybe blew up their bar.

1236
01:13:32,202 --> 01:13:34,345
- Oh!
- Ah, perfect!

1237
01:13:34,345 --> 01:13:37,232
- Oh, we're dead!
- Oh, come on!

1238
01:13:37,545 --> 01:13:39,324
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

1239
01:13:39,324 --> 01:13:42,348
That means
they're just here to kill us.

1240
01:13:47,773 --> 01:13:49,063
No sign of 'em, Jack.

1241
01:13:53,385 --> 01:13:55,386
Wild Hogs!

1242
01:13:55,386 --> 01:13:58,555
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

1243
01:13:58,555 --> 01:14:01,166
I finally meet a girl,
and now I'm gonna die.

1244
01:14:01,166 --> 01:14:03,016
So, all the mustard
and the ketchup...

1245
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:05,696
didn't help
the situation, huh?

1246
01:14:05,907 --> 01:14:07,166
Ohhh!

1247
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:11,440
Oh, you don't wanna
come out? We'll wait!

1248
01:14:11,777 --> 01:14:14,387
There's only one road
out of this town!

1249
01:14:14,387 --> 01:14:16,175
We own it!

1250
01:14:16,394 --> 01:14:20,079
Me and my boys will be
in this lovely little diner here!

1251
01:14:20,167 --> 01:14:24,074
Get out of here!
The longer you keep us waiting,

1252
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:29,862
the worse it's gonna get for
the peaceful town of Madrid!

1253
01:14:33,138 --> 01:14:37,580
Jack! I'm going
to ask you not to.

1254
01:14:37,672 --> 01:14:38,787
What did you say,
you little turd?

1255
01:14:39,096 --> 01:14:41,467
- What he say?
- He called him a turd.

1256
01:14:44,439 --> 01:14:46,401
- Let's go!
- Enjoy.

1257
01:14:47,633 --> 01:14:49,080
Okay,
I made a mistake.

1258
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,897
Woody, we could have just
went home, man, and been fine.

1259
01:14:51,897 --> 01:14:54,124
Yeah, well, you know,
maybe I don't have a home.

1260
01:14:54,777 --> 01:14:56,413
Claudia left me.

1261
01:14:57,258 --> 01:14:59,203
Three months ago she left.

1262
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:01,703
Then I fell apart...
lost my clients...

1263
01:15:01,703 --> 01:15:03,374
then I... lost my job.

1264
01:15:04,132 --> 01:15:06,336
Now I gotta sell the house
and I gotta sell the car...

1265
01:15:06,506 --> 01:15:08,958
Can't even get
the-the lawn raked, you know?

1266
01:15:08,958 --> 01:15:11,341
Now I just got the bike and
I got you guys. That's all I got.

1267
01:15:11,341 --> 01:15:14,158
So this trip is all about
you running away

1268
01:15:14,158 --> 01:15:16,926
from your miserable,
screwed-up life?

1269
01:15:17,488 --> 01:15:21,713
A-a-a-and you screw up
our lives? Asshole!

1270
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:25,445
I'm sorry about your situation,
Woody, but you're a lying asshole.

1271
01:15:25,445 --> 01:15:28,679
- Which is like an asshole's asshole.
- Well, you know, I thought that...

1272
01:15:28,679 --> 01:15:32,218
I thought that maybe being a Wild Hog
meant something. But clearly it doesn't.

1273
01:15:32,218 --> 01:15:35,220
You don't care about me!
That's fine. I don't care.

1274
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:37,285
It doesn't mean anything,
Woody!

1275
01:15:37,285 --> 01:15:39,891
Remember, it's just
a patch my wife made!

1276
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:41,481
We should go somewhere
to yell at each other

1277
01:15:41,481 --> 01:15:43,379
where there aren't people
trying to kill us.

1278
01:15:49,176 --> 01:15:50,334
Hey, Maggie.

1279
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:54,282
Thanks for letting us
hide in your house.

1280
01:15:54,282 --> 01:15:55,472
Yeah, thanks.

1281
01:15:55,472 --> 01:15:58,524
It's kinda hard not to when you're
screaming and kicking down the door.

1282
01:15:59,419 --> 01:16:02,362
Hey. You okay?

1283
01:16:02,362 --> 01:16:05,161
Mm. Yeah.
Diner's the only thing I have.

1284
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:06,947
If that gets destroyed,
it's...

1285
01:16:09,628 --> 01:16:11,703
But you're safe.
You guys are safe.

1286
01:16:11,703 --> 01:16:13,449
Now just stay put.

1287
01:16:13,556 --> 01:16:16,110
Nobody has to go out there
and be a hero.

1288
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:17,607
You got that right.

1289
01:16:17,607 --> 01:16:19,230
You guys aren't
going out there?

1290
01:16:19,230 --> 01:16:21,328
You're the sheriff.
Why don't you go out there?

1291
01:16:21,328 --> 01:16:24,510
Like sheriff
of a town of 500 people,

1292
01:16:24,645 --> 01:16:27,680
I got my qualification
from a course on the Internet.

1293
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:30,339
For arms training,
they just told us to play Doom.

1294
01:16:30,409 --> 01:16:32,187
I say
we just wait it out,

1295
01:16:32,451 --> 01:16:34,287
they'll lose interest,
and they'll go.

1296
01:16:34,287 --> 01:16:36,891
Yeah, I agree.
Wait it out.

1297
01:16:37,849 --> 01:16:41,121
Hey. Where's Dudley?

1298
01:16:49,037 --> 01:16:50,521
Oh, Dudley,
don't do that.

1299
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:57,099
All right, you Del Fuegos...

1300
01:17:04,485 --> 01:17:05,305
Hey!

1301
01:17:09,023 --> 01:17:10,216
Let's end this.

1302
01:17:10,216 --> 01:17:13,083
At least one of you
came out to face the music.

1303
01:17:13,561 --> 01:17:16,303
Very brave.
But stupid.

1304
01:17:16,303 --> 01:17:18,478
I didn't come
to face any music.

1305
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:21,793
I came here to stop you fellas
from hurting this diner,

1306
01:17:22,286 --> 01:17:25,564
which the love of my life
just happens to own.

1307
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:31,102
So, if it's gotta get ugly...
I'll give you ugly.

1308
01:17:38,369 --> 01:17:40,110
It slipped out of my glove.

1309
01:17:40,277 --> 01:17:43,646
Hey! Is it okay if I tell people
you guys did that?

1310
01:17:43,646 --> 01:17:45,655
I... I should be getting back.
It's late.

1311
01:17:45,655 --> 01:17:48,242
The guys are gonna be worrying.
We'll talk later.

1312
01:17:49,295 --> 01:17:51,642
Guys! Guys!

1313
01:17:51,642 --> 01:17:54,118
No, no. You don't get to
hide out here with us.

1314
01:17:54,118 --> 01:17:57,254
You get to hide outside with
those crazy people that wanna kill us.

1315
01:17:57,254 --> 01:18:00,109
- They got Dudley. Look out the window.
- What?

1316
01:18:00,109 --> 01:18:03,260
All right, this is
what's gonna happen, Wild Hogs!

1317
01:18:03,730 --> 01:18:08,021
You're gonna pay
a disobedience fee of 10,000 dollars!

1318
01:18:08,021 --> 01:18:11,829
Plus another 40,000
to rebuild the bar!

1319
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,266
And if you wanna
see your friend alive again,

1320
01:18:14,266 --> 01:18:16,226
do not call the cops!

1321
01:18:16,226 --> 01:18:18,876
If you're not here
in a half an hour to settle this,

1322
01:18:19,192 --> 01:18:22,209
I'm gonna take the fine out
on your friend's legs!

1323
01:18:22,209 --> 01:18:25,217
I'm gonna break 'em
with this tire iron!

1324
01:18:25,217 --> 01:18:27,152
Don't bring the money!

1325
01:18:27,152 --> 01:18:30,809
I'm a computer programmer!
I don't need my legs!

1326
01:18:30,809 --> 01:18:33,840
Fine! I'll break his hands!

1327
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,588
- Yeah!
- Damn it.

1328
01:18:35,588 --> 01:18:37,124
Bring the money!

1329
01:18:37,124 --> 01:18:40,017
Definitely!
Definitely bring money!

1330
01:18:40,017 --> 01:18:43,024
- Get him out of here!
- Now! We need money!

1331
01:18:45,978 --> 01:18:49,119
Dudley went there to save the diner,
now they're gonna break his hands.

1332
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:51,910
No, they're not. Cause we're gonna...
We're gonna get him back.

1333
01:18:51,910 --> 01:18:54,850
I called in the highway patrol.
They're gonna be here in two hours.

1334
01:18:54,850 --> 01:18:59,016
Hey, man. They said no cops, or else
they gonna take it out on Dudley.

1335
01:18:59,016 --> 01:19:01,928
We don't wanna piss 'em off
until we get him out of their hands.

1336
01:19:01,928 --> 01:19:04,719
Well, you know, he's-he's not exactly
in their hands now, okay?

1337
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:06,060
Why not?
He was sitting right...

1338
01:19:06,489 --> 01:19:10,241
- What the...?
- Get me down!

1339
01:19:11,127 --> 01:19:13,079
Why? You look good
up there!

1340
01:19:13,079 --> 01:19:15,442
You look like
a piata with red hair!

1341
01:19:16,741 --> 01:19:20,131
I think... I think I'm gonna keep you
up there till your buddies come!

1342
01:19:20,131 --> 01:19:22,730
And then if they don't,
I'm gonna bust you open

1343
01:19:22,730 --> 01:19:24,826
and we're gonna see
what falls out!

1344
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:29,695
Bobby! Woody! Doug!

1345
01:19:29,764 --> 01:19:31,321
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

1346
01:19:31,321 --> 01:19:33,599
I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go get 'im.

1347
01:19:34,546 --> 01:19:36,296
There you go
talking crazy again.

1348
01:19:36,296 --> 01:19:39,133
- They will kill you.
- No, I'm not talking crazy.

1349
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,339
I have three people left
in my life that I care about,

1350
01:19:42,565 --> 01:19:44,532
and I let you guys down.

1351
01:19:44,687 --> 01:19:46,503
Nah. I'd rather go out there
and make it go right

1352
01:19:47,042 --> 01:19:50,319
and die doing it than be the asshole
that screwed everything up.

1353
01:19:50,455 --> 01:19:52,255
Hey, hey, Woody,
Woody, where you going?

1354
01:20:00,013 --> 01:20:01,124
Woody!

1355
01:20:02,973 --> 01:20:05,333
Don't you know hogs
run in packs, baby?

1356
01:20:08,437 --> 01:20:09,926
We're still Wild Hogs?

1357
01:20:10,993 --> 01:20:13,120
- Wild Hogs, man.
- Wild Hogs.

1358
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,319
All right, here's
how it's gotta go.

1359
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:16,932
I gotta get up to 30 miles an hour
on a short distance.

1360
01:20:16,932 --> 01:20:18,510
It's only duct tape
holding that rope out there.

1361
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:21,243
I'll get him by the trunk
and I'll grab 'im, I'll save Dudley.

1362
01:20:21,243 --> 01:20:22,711
You'll need a distraction.

1363
01:20:23,197 --> 01:20:26,850
Together, guys. Together we can do this.
I'm ready. I'm ready.

1364
01:20:27,106 --> 01:20:28,292
I'm ready.

1365
01:20:28,934 --> 01:20:30,297
- What?
- What's wrong?

1366
01:20:30,717 --> 01:20:32,816
- It's gonna sound kind of stupid.
- What?

1367
01:20:32,816 --> 01:20:35,144
Well, before I go,
I need one of you to yell,

1368
01:20:35,898 --> 01:20:38,741
"It's the Golden Knight!" You know,
it helps me get in the mood.

1369
01:20:39,341 --> 01:20:40,597
Yeah, baby!

1370
01:20:40,597 --> 01:20:41,972
- It helps motivate me.
- He's back!

1371
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:47,022
It's the Golden Knight...

1372
01:20:47,041 --> 01:20:48,755
With gusto, though.

1373
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:58,968
- Now?
- Now!

1374
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:01,774
Holy crap,
it's the Golden Knight!

1375
01:21:10,644 --> 01:21:13,082
Clear 'em out, boys!
Clear 'em out!

1376
01:21:13,082 --> 01:21:16,125
Del Fuego!
Come out and play, baby!

1377
01:21:16,125 --> 01:21:18,907
All day, baby! All day!

1378
01:21:18,907 --> 01:21:21,626
Thirty-five, thirty-five,
exactly thirty-five!

1379
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:25,910
Wild Hogs, baby!
Wild Hogs!

1380
01:21:28,352 --> 01:21:29,442
Okay, guys, slow down.
You're gonna...

1381
01:21:31,749 --> 01:21:34,701
Oh, no, no, no...
Ooh... Whoa!

1382
01:21:34,701 --> 01:21:36,195
Du-Dud-Dudley!

1383
01:21:37,366 --> 01:21:40,528
- Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho...
- All right, I gotcha. I gotcha.

1384
01:21:41,506 --> 01:21:45,093
- You having fun?
- That was amazing!

1385
01:21:45,093 --> 01:21:47,400
The tape was supposed
to break!

1386
01:21:50,456 --> 01:21:52,626
- Oh...
- There it goes.

1387
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:55,543
- Is there a problem?
- Come on. Come on!

1388
01:21:55,843 --> 01:21:57,443
You burned down
Damien's bar,

1389
01:21:57,443 --> 01:22:00,024
you pull this
little circus act out here,

1390
01:22:00,142 --> 01:22:03,105
now you're gonna see what
it's like when you mess with us.

1391
01:22:03,105 --> 01:22:05,628
- That's right.
- Burn down the diner!

1392
01:22:05,628 --> 01:22:07,134
- Torch it!
- Look, look...

1393
01:22:07,134 --> 01:22:08,266
We can come up
with the money,

1394
01:22:08,266 --> 01:22:10,073
I got a little bit
in my savings.

1395
01:22:10,073 --> 01:22:13,391
I did it.
I cut the fuel lines.

1396
01:22:13,391 --> 01:22:15,783
Let me deal with it.
Let these guys go.

1397
01:22:15,983 --> 01:22:19,665
No! We're not gonna pay any money
and we're not calling the cops.

1398
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:23,311
We're gonna stand here
and fight.

1399
01:22:25,655 --> 01:22:27,457
You don't want our money.

1400
01:22:27,457 --> 01:22:29,420
What do you need money for?
You're free.

1401
01:22:29,463 --> 01:22:31,559
You know, you're just here
to... get what you get

1402
01:22:31,559 --> 01:22:33,181
from the townspeople
all the time, fear,

1403
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:36,247
because you're scary people.
People'll do anything to stay safe,

1404
01:22:36,247 --> 01:22:38,197
including give up the biggest
part of their lives, their adventure.

1405
01:22:38,527 --> 01:22:43,083
I say let's have a little adventure,
huh? Let's fight. Let's dance, huh?

1406
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:44,936
- Let's do it!
- Enough's enough.

1407
01:22:45,073 --> 01:22:48,004
- Let's kick some Del Taco ass.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1408
01:22:48,004 --> 01:22:50,549
Do either of you guys
have a knife or scissors?

1409
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:51,821
A nail clipper?

1410
01:22:51,821 --> 01:22:53,740
All right,
so how do we do this?

1411
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:56,102
Like high school?
A little circle, huh?

1412
01:22:57,333 --> 01:23:00,441
Murdock, Red, Tiny.
Four on four.

1413
01:23:01,544 --> 01:23:03,920
- Body or face, pretty boy?
- Not the face.

1414
01:23:05,727 --> 01:23:06,857
Ow!

1415
01:23:18,453 --> 01:23:20,612
- I'll take him.
- Thank you!

1416
01:23:32,406 --> 01:23:34,555
- Trade back! Trade back.
- I got him.

1417
01:23:34,555 --> 01:23:36,874
It's not really fair,
you know. I'm kinda tied up.

1418
01:23:39,597 --> 01:23:43,062
You ever see a hook off the jab?
Huh? Bring it!

1419
01:23:50,823 --> 01:23:52,126
Let's have a little fun,
baby.

1420
01:23:52,809 --> 01:23:53,898
Let's play.

1421
01:23:54,962 --> 01:23:56,250
Golden Glove, baby.

1422
01:24:00,444 --> 01:24:02,925
Ow! Ow!
You hit my helmet.

1423
01:24:02,925 --> 01:24:04,353
Are you okay, man?
You hurt your hand?

1424
01:24:04,353 --> 01:24:05,888
That actually really hurt.

1425
01:24:11,787 --> 01:24:14,002
Good shot! Get off!

1426
01:24:15,410 --> 01:24:17,602
Uh-oh, no, no, no, no,
don't...

1427
01:24:18,641 --> 01:24:19,916
- Throw sand!
- What?

1428
01:24:19,916 --> 01:24:21,859
- Throw sand!
- Yeah...

1429
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:24,708
I didn't mean
to aim there...

1430
01:24:27,509 --> 01:24:28,908
Whoo! Nice...

1431
01:24:35,625 --> 01:24:38,378
Damn!
I knocked out my boy!

1432
01:24:38,678 --> 01:24:40,653
Come on. You all right?

1433
01:24:49,378 --> 01:24:50,800
Well, that was easy.

1434
01:24:54,321 --> 01:24:55,957
- Come on.
- Burn down the diner!

1435
01:24:55,957 --> 01:24:59,034
- Yeah!
- Come on!

1436
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:01,944
- Oh, good. You want some more?
- I got nothing to lose.

1437
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:06,055
I got no wife.
No job. No house.

1438
01:25:06,055 --> 01:25:09,375
I got my friends, though.
I got them till the end.

1439
01:25:10,571 --> 01:25:12,680
- Oh!
- That's great!

1440
01:25:12,946 --> 01:25:15,353
You know, you know
what's so stupid about this?

1441
01:25:15,353 --> 01:25:18,255
We wanted to be like you guys.
You know, cause what I see here

1442
01:25:18,255 --> 01:25:19,760
is just a bunch of grown men

1443
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:24,161
whose biggest decision in life is
"Uh, sleeveless or, uh... sleeveless?"

1444
01:25:24,161 --> 01:25:27,097
"Do I shit behind the rock,
or over there by that bush?"

1445
01:25:27,589 --> 01:25:29,746
Grown men.
This is pathetic.

1446
01:25:29,746 --> 01:25:31,450
You go ahead
and kick our ass, okay?

1447
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:34,587
Because we're not the posers.
You guys are the posers.

1448
01:25:34,739 --> 01:25:35,894
Ow!

1449
01:25:37,226 --> 01:25:41,512
Hey! Do yourselves a favor
and stay down!

1450
01:25:42,036 --> 01:25:44,056
Twenty-five years
of being yelled at.

1451
01:25:44,056 --> 01:25:45,073
Man, I ain't taking this...

1452
01:25:48,707 --> 01:25:52,573
And I got a girlfriend.
Punch that out of me, bitches.

1453
01:26:00,955 --> 01:26:02,404
- Oh.
- Are we doing this?

1454
01:26:06,190 --> 01:26:07,907
- Let's do it.
- Yeah.

1455
01:26:08,052 --> 01:26:08,978
Come on.

1456
01:26:14,725 --> 01:26:15,831
Come on.

1457
01:26:25,648 --> 01:26:27,272
You're kiddin' me, right?

1458
01:26:31,592 --> 01:26:33,315
What's wrong with you guys?

1459
01:26:35,119 --> 01:26:37,296
All right!
You wanna keep goin'?

1460
01:26:37,858 --> 01:26:39,845
I don't think so.

1461
01:26:39,845 --> 01:26:44,924
You're done, Jack.
You Del Fuegos! You are done!

1462
01:26:44,924 --> 01:26:47,270
And we want you
out of our town, now.

1463
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:50,094
- And who's "we"?
- All of us.

1464
01:26:53,675 --> 01:26:56,540
If four people could
stand up to a gang of bikers,

1465
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:58,743
I guess we can too!

1466
01:26:58,743 --> 01:27:01,680
Well, we'll fight you and
the Children of the Corn too.

1467
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:06,365
Cause the Del Fuegos don't
back down! This is our highway.

1468
01:27:06,365 --> 01:27:08,967
And we're gonna
defend our highway.

1469
01:27:08,967 --> 01:27:11,034
Wrong, Jack.

1470
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:15,887
- It's my highway.
- Blade.

1471
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:18,511
Hi, Maggie.

1472
01:27:20,662 --> 01:27:24,984
- Hmm. Bar burned down.
- Yeah.

1473
01:27:25,382 --> 01:27:28,145
These posers,
these four posers right here.

1474
01:27:28,145 --> 01:27:31,986
Four guys
stand off 50 bikers...

1475
01:27:33,243 --> 01:27:35,760
- and they're the posers?
- Yeah.

1476
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,481
They burned down
the bar that you built.

1477
01:27:37,481 --> 01:27:38,944
It was a shithole.

1478
01:27:38,944 --> 01:27:41,207
I insured it for twice
what it was worth.

1479
01:27:41,207 --> 01:27:43,189
The guys did me a favor.

1480
01:27:43,189 --> 01:27:45,836
We were just following
the code that you wrote.

1481
01:27:45,836 --> 01:27:48,236
Why do you think
I don't wear the colors, Jack?

1482
01:27:48,236 --> 01:27:50,103
Why do you think
I ride alone?

1483
01:27:50,103 --> 01:27:52,299
Cause you don't
know about it anymore.

1484
01:27:52,299 --> 01:27:55,355
I think you all oughta get back on your
bikes and go out and ride the highway

1485
01:27:55,587 --> 01:27:58,508
until you remember
what riding's all about.

1486
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,569
Let it go, Jack.

1487
01:28:13,961 --> 01:28:19,271
- Okay, pop.
- Takes after his mom.

1488
01:28:29,481 --> 01:28:32,288
Man, that was like
level 12 of Doom.

1489
01:28:33,804 --> 01:28:35,118
The posers.

1490
01:28:36,143 --> 01:28:37,906
- What do you guys call yourselves?
- I'm Woody.

1491
01:28:37,906 --> 01:28:38,464
- I'm Bobby.
- I'm Doug.

1492
01:28:38,464 --> 01:28:40,840
No, no, no.
You all riding together?

1493
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:43,387
- What you, what you...
- Hogs! Wild Hogs.

1494
01:28:43,387 --> 01:28:45,385
- Wild...
- Yeah, Wild Hogs.

1495
01:28:46,692 --> 01:28:50,900
Well, Wild Hogs,
ride hard or stay home.

1496
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:54,877
- Yeah.
- Oh, guys? Lose the watches.

1497
01:28:57,625 --> 01:28:59,338
- Freedom, baby.
- We did it, babe.

1498
01:29:00,444 --> 01:29:02,672
All day. All day.

1499
01:29:02,672 --> 01:29:06,482
Hey! Hey! We're the Wild Hogs!
The saga continues!

1500
01:29:21,854 --> 01:29:22,965
What the hell?

1501
01:29:23,490 --> 01:29:26,204
What in the world
is going on around here?

1502
01:29:27,267 --> 01:29:30,799
Plumbing conference?
Have you lost your mind?

1503
01:29:30,799 --> 01:29:31,890
Shut up, Doug!

1504
01:29:32,511 --> 01:29:35,510
Bobby, who are these people,
and where are we at?

1505
01:29:35,510 --> 01:29:39,273
Well, obviously, I'm not at a...
plumbing conference in Cleveland, baby.

1506
01:29:39,273 --> 01:29:40,042
Oh, really?

1507
01:29:40,042 --> 01:29:42,221
Baby, I've been
fighting bikers all day,

1508
01:29:42,571 --> 01:29:44,973
this little Chinese
dude bust my nose,

1509
01:29:44,973 --> 01:29:46,694
I've been slapping bulls...

1510
01:29:46,694 --> 01:29:50,332
Bobby, I don't give a damn
about you fightin' no bulls!

1511
01:29:50,392 --> 01:29:52,756
Now, I want you to get
your ass in that van

1512
01:29:52,756 --> 01:29:53,972
because we are going home.

1513
01:29:53,972 --> 01:29:55,462
I cannot believe that
you'd deceive me like this!

1514
01:29:55,462 --> 01:29:57,635
- Karen...
- No, Bobby, I want...

1515
01:29:57,635 --> 01:29:58,884
Karen!

1516
01:30:00,211 --> 01:30:01,535
Slow your roll.

1517
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:05,241
Look, baby,
I love you. Okay?

1518
01:30:05,449 --> 01:30:07,295
But I'm tired
of being talked at.

1519
01:30:07,295 --> 01:30:09,783
I don't talk at you, Bobby!

1520
01:30:09,783 --> 01:30:11,906
- Bobby, I talk...
- Karen, look at what you're doin' now.

1521
01:30:11,947 --> 01:30:14,227
Come on. You feel me?

1522
01:30:14,628 --> 01:30:17,062
Okay, baby, all right,
all right, I feel you.

1523
01:30:17,062 --> 01:30:19,339
Right now, I just need
you to show me some love.

1524
01:30:19,661 --> 01:30:21,379
Just a little bit o' love.

1525
01:30:22,859 --> 01:30:24,959
Mmm...

1526
01:30:27,674 --> 01:30:29,369
That's scrumptious.

1527
01:30:29,533 --> 01:30:31,109
You seriously got
in a fight with bikers?

1528
01:30:31,109 --> 01:30:33,690
Yeah, a whole bunch of 'em.
We-we-we chased 'em out of town!

1529
01:30:33,690 --> 01:30:34,396
There was 50 of them.

1530
01:30:34,396 --> 01:30:36,021
- It was... it was something.
- Fifty?

1531
01:30:36,021 --> 01:30:38,882
I gotta tell the guys
about this. That is awesome!

1532
01:30:38,882 --> 01:30:39,896
I'll be right back.

1533
01:30:41,201 --> 01:30:42,486
Doug, are you sure
you're okay?

1534
01:30:43,455 --> 01:30:45,705
- Ow, ow, ow, ow...
- Oh, your ribs, your ribs.

1535
01:30:45,705 --> 01:30:47,658
- No, no, you're standing on my foot!
- Oh, sorry!

1536
01:30:48,055 --> 01:30:49,291
So I'll see you
when I get back?

1537
01:30:49,291 --> 01:30:51,178
- Mm-hmm.
- All right?

1538
01:30:51,178 --> 01:30:54,599
- Mmm. I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

1539
01:30:54,599 --> 01:30:55,752
All right.

1540
01:31:02,067 --> 01:31:05,865
- Get a room, baby.
- Can we? Do we have time?

1541
01:31:06,657 --> 01:31:10,168
- When you coming back through?
- A biker never knows.

1542
01:31:10,168 --> 01:31:11,396
Maybe a week.

1543
01:31:12,416 --> 01:31:13,910
Maybe a month.

1544
01:31:14,933 --> 01:31:17,529
Six days, ten hours,
27 minutes,

1545
01:31:17,529 --> 01:31:20,395
give or take... six minutes
for wind resistance.

1546
01:31:24,736 --> 01:31:27,734
Well, I sure do wish
you guys would stick around.

1547
01:31:27,734 --> 01:31:30,133
We got some riding to do, sheriff.
But thanks anyway.

1548
01:31:30,133 --> 01:31:31,657
Well, I'll just say it:

1549
01:31:31,657 --> 01:31:33,855
You fellas were
a blessing to this place.

1550
01:31:33,855 --> 01:31:36,099
I mean, I'm not gonna
get all emotional

1551
01:31:36,099 --> 01:31:38,524
like old hamburger head
over here always...

1552
01:31:40,569 --> 01:31:42,411
What did you
just call me?

1553
01:31:42,776 --> 01:31:45,210
Uh, see, when we walked up,
you were on my...

1554
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:48,334
You son of a bitch!

1555
01:31:48,942 --> 01:31:51,843
Come on, Buck, I swear.
That's the first time!

1556
01:31:51,843 --> 01:31:54,461
- I don't wanna hear it!
- Well, honestly, you can't.

1557
01:31:54,461 --> 01:31:55,024
I heard that.

1558
01:31:56,023 --> 01:31:59,168
- Ready to ride, guys?
- Ready to ride, baby.

1559
01:31:59,168 --> 01:32:01,568
Let's see what
the West Coast has to offer.

1560
01:32:01,715 --> 01:32:03,585
Think there'll be
any trouble along the way?

1561
01:32:03,585 --> 01:32:07,714
- Oh, I hope so.
- Yeah, I like the way you think.

1562
01:32:07,953 --> 01:32:09,987
I like the way you think.

1563
01:32:26,995 --> 01:32:29,603
I'm okay!
I just hurt my face.

1564
01:33:22,178 --> 01:33:23,582
Wow!

1565
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:28,012
- Hey, we did it!
- Woo-hoo!

1566
01:33:28,012 --> 01:33:29,314
Do you believe this?

1567
01:33:34,491 --> 01:33:36,758
- Hello!
- Whoa, my goodness.

1568
01:33:36,758 --> 01:33:39,909
Whoa, oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh! Whoa!

1569
01:33:39,980 --> 01:33:41,536
Whoa! Ah!

1570
01:33:44,238 --> 01:33:45,907
Sorry, sorry.

1571
01:33:47,350 --> 01:33:50,125
Two thousand miles,
but I finally got it.

1572
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:51,880
'Bout time, rookie!

1573
01:33:54,604 --> 01:33:58,236
- Lot of distractions.
- California, baby!

1574
01:34:17,516 --> 01:34:19,668
Welcome back to Extreme Makeover
Home Edition.

1575
01:34:19,668 --> 01:34:21,697
Now, we've met
some incredible families,

1576
01:34:22,125 --> 01:34:24,014
but this could be
the saddest story we've...

1577
01:34:24,423 --> 01:34:25,790
We've ever seen.

1578
01:34:25,790 --> 01:34:28,239
This family
has lost everything.

1579
01:34:28,695 --> 01:34:31,276
They've lost their home,
they've lost their history,

1580
01:34:31,276 --> 01:34:33,042
they've lost their heritage.

1581
01:34:33,533 --> 01:34:35,727
But this week, we've done
something about that.

1582
01:34:35,727 --> 01:34:39,048
So let's welcome back...
the Del Fuego family!

1583
01:34:45,038 --> 01:34:46,702
Jack, two months ago, man,

1584
01:34:46,702 --> 01:34:48,703
you lost the only home
you ever knew.

1585
01:34:51,411 --> 01:34:51,431
But thanks to a phone call
from your friends, the Wild Hogs,

1586
01:34:51,852 --> 01:34:52,714
we built you a new one.

1587
01:34:52,988 --> 01:34:54,517
That's so great.

1588
01:34:54,517 --> 01:34:58,050
They... He didn't have to
mention us. That's... Oh, man.

1589
01:34:58,050 --> 01:34:59,159
<i>So you guys know what to say?</i>

1590
01:34:59,159 --> 01:35:03,324
- Say it with me!
- Bus driver, move that bus!

1591
01:35:08,368 --> 01:35:09,503
Oh!

1592
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:11,821
Wow!

1593
01:35:18,722 --> 01:35:21,503
You know, usually we have some
pretty emotional reactions,

1594
01:35:21,503 --> 01:35:24,697
but, uh, Jack,
you know, wow.

1595
01:35:25,518 --> 01:35:28,849
I'm not sure... what
was going on with Jack.

1596
01:35:28,849 --> 01:35:30,216
Oh...

1597
01:35:30,518 --> 01:35:32,948
Thanks to our friends at Sears
and local breweries,

1598
01:35:32,948 --> 01:35:37,413
who provided state-of-the-art taps
and a year's supply of free beer!

1599
01:35:41,016 --> 01:35:44,105
Oh, my God!
That is so cool!

1600
01:35:44,105 --> 01:35:45,323
That is so cool!

1601
01:35:45,323 --> 01:35:48,408
Cool as a parking lot
made out of real leather?

1602
01:35:48,408 --> 01:35:50,450
- Oh!
- That is so rad!

1603
01:35:50,450 --> 01:35:52,253
That is so rad!

1604
01:35:56,157 --> 01:35:59,487
The bar was... my home.
When it went down,

1605
01:35:59,487 --> 01:36:03,108
I-I felt... homeless.

1606
01:36:03,729 --> 01:36:07,913
Del Fuegos,
go check out your new home!

1607
01:36:13,174 --> 01:36:15,174
Here's the thing. You're
talking about a bunch of guys

1608
01:36:15,174 --> 01:36:18,460
that grew up in broken homes.
They really didn't even have a home.

1609
01:36:18,460 --> 01:36:21,299
And now they've got one.
With a bidet in it.

1610
01:36:21,498 --> 01:36:22,853
Thank you!

1611
01:36:28,418 --> 01:36:31,642
We love our bar.
Thanks, America!

1612
01:36:32,402 --> 01:36:33,860
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

1613
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:35,767
Wild Hogs!
