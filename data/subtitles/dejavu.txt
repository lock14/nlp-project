About a million of those blue particles
washed up on the Algiers side.

71
00:11:41,544 --> 00:11:44,035

73
00:11:45,481 --> 00:11:47,244

75
00:11:49,352 --> 00:11:51,912
The insulation on the leg wire
will inform us

of the blasting cap is.

77
00:11:54,457 --> 00:11:56,049

79
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,695

Heavy fuel burns,

PETN, that's the base explosive

She also lost several fingers

Appeared?

308
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,281
That's right. I checked the tide tables
against the position of the blast.

309
00:26:18,383 --> 00:26:20,977
For her to have washed up
that early and that far upriver,

310
00:26:21,086 --> 00:26:24,544
she would've had to have been killed
two hours before the ferry exploded.

311
00:26:24,656 --> 00:26:25,884
Before?

312
00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:29,690
She died before the explosion?

00:26:29,795 --> 00:26:33,526
She died before the explosion, yeah.
Her name is Claire Kuchever.

314
00:26:33,632 --> 00:26:36,829
She washed up before the explosion
and against the tide.

315
00:26:37,369 --> 00:26:39,963
- Do you have a scenario?
- Yes, I do.

316
00:26:40,072 --> 00:26:43,838
I believe that somebody abducted her
in her home, taped her mouth,

317
00:26:43,942 --> 00:26:46,740
bound her wrists, burned her alive,
dumped her in the river

318
00:26:46,845 --> 00:26:49,871
so she would appear to be
just another disaster victim.

319
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:52,441
A disaster that hadn't happened yet.

320
00:26:52,551 --> 00:26:55,111
But the PETN tells us

321
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,882
that the bomber came in direct contact
with the victim.

322
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,981

to drive the bomb to the ferry.

All right? But given enough lead time,

418
00:33:40,821 --> 00:33:43,085
we can look anywhere
within the target area, all right?

419
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:47,058
It's the when that's always constant.
It's always four days and six hours ago.

It's like a single trailing moment of now,
in the past.

00:33:54,334 --> 00:33:59,294
Okay. So if you can't move forward
or backward in time,

423
00:33:59,406 --> 00:34:01,374
how is it the image keeps
speeding up like that?

424
00:34:01,475 --> 00:34:04,706
It's not the image that's moving faster,
it's just our shifting point of view.

425
00:34:04,811 --> 00:34:07,575
The passage of time remains constant,

- That's what I'm gonna do.
- Nobody home.

676
00:48:43,685 --> 00:48:45,676
How'd you let that happen?

677
00:48:47,689 --> 00:48:51,352
Everything you have, you lose, right?
Mother, father, gone.

678
00:48:51,893 --> 00:48:54,088
Good looks, Pryzwarra, gone.

679
00:48:54,863 --> 00:48:56,592
Loved ones gone in a second.

680
00:48:56,698 --> 00:48:59,030
That's what this job teaches you,
doesn't it?

681
00:48:59,134 --> 00:49:00,726
No matter what,

682
00:49:01,136 --> 00:49:04,936
no matter how hard you grab
onto something, you still lose it, right?

683
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,703
Well, we're gonna grab onto this guy
in a couple hours.

684
00:49:09,244 --> 00:49:11,735
We're gonna nail this son of a bitch.

685
00:49:13,749 --> 00:49:15,182
What's wrong?

686
00:49:18,053 --> 00:49:20,453
No matter what, we still lose her.

687
00:49:22,891 --> 00:49:24,017

00:50:25,353 --> 00:50:26,980
- DENNY: Gunnars.
- It's rebooting. It's coming back.

707
00:50:27,088 --> 00:50:28,953
- Are we online?
- Wait.

708
00:50:29,057 --> 00:50:30,046
- Are we online?
- Gunnars!

00:50:30,158 --> 00:50:32,183
- What the hell's going on?
- Shanti, are we back online?

710
00:50:32,294 --> 00:50:33,591
SHANTI: I don't know.
Something broached the field.

711
00:50:33,695 --> 00:50:36,129
- What broached the field?
- That broached the field, right there.

712
00:50:36,231 --> 00:50:38,927
That broached the field, right there.
That's what broached the field.

713
00:50:39,034 --> 00:50:41,025
Now, you wanna tell me
what the hell this thing is?

714
00:50:41,136 --> 00:50:44,537
It's not surveillance, Paul.
It's not electronic thermal imaging.

715
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:47,301
You guys have figured out a way
to look into the past. Yes or no?

716
00:50:47,409 --> 00:50:48,376
- No.
- You're lying.

717
00:50:48,476 --> 00:50:50,944
- You're lying, and you know it.
- I've told you everything I can.

718
00:50:51,046 --> 00:50:53,776
She saw it, Paul.
I pointed this thing at her just now,

719
00:50:53,882 --> 00:50:56,578
and she responded to it
from four and a half days ago.

720
00:50:56,685 --> 00:50:58,949
- Explain that to me.
- All right.

721
00:50:59,321 --> 00:51:01,255
CARLIN: Somebody explain it!

722
00:51:02,924 --> 00:51:04,414
Hit it, Shanti.

723
00:51:06,561 --> 00:51:07,892
For three years,
Cambridge has been working

724
00:51:07,996 --> 00:51:09,987
for National Reconnaissance
on an R & D grant.

725
00:51:10,098 --> 00:51:11,156
Okay.

726
00:51:11,266 --> 00:51:13,666
We were attempting
to use concentrated bursts of energy

727
00:51:13,768 --> 00:51:16,202
to enhance the sensitivity
of optical telescopes.

728
00:51:16,304 --> 00:51:17,703
In the process, we had a breakthrough.

729
00:51:17,806 --> 00:51:20,240
Given enough energy,
we could warp the very fabric of space.

730
00:51:20,342 --> 00:51:22,902
I said explain it to me, not talk science.

731
00:51:23,011 --> 00:51:24,638
- They found a way to...
- Look, I'll tell you what.

732
00:51:24,746 --> 00:51:27,408
Why don't you guys just keep talking?
I'll just sit here

733
00:51:27,515 --> 00:51:29,642
until you figure out
what it is you really wanna tell me.

734
00:51:29,751 --> 00:51:32,811
They found a way
to fold space back onto itself.

735
00:51:34,723 --> 00:51:38,853
All right, look. We're used to viewing
space as flat, right?

736
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:39,949
- Like this piece of paper.
- Right.

737
00:51:40,061 --> 00:51:42,427
To see something from a distance,
light has always had to travel

738
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:44,088
the long way
across the flat space in between.

739
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:45,598
But given what I was trying to explain,

740
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,464
we can fold the space,
bring the target closer to us,

741
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:50,401
create what's known as
an Einstein-Rosen bridge,

742
00:51:50,505 --> 00:51:53,531
otherwise known as a wormhole,
suspend it via gravitational field.

743
00:51:53,642 --> 00:51:54,870
- That's what we're looking at?
- That's it.

744
00:51:54,976 --> 00:51:56,910
What's on the other end of the bridge?

745
00:51:57,012 --> 00:51:58,536
Claire's house.

746
00:52:00,515 --> 00:52:01,539
Wow.

747
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:03,709
Basically, we're folding space
in a higher dimension

748
00:52:03,818 --> 00:52:06,480
to create an instantaneous link
between two distant points.

749
00:52:06,588 --> 00:52:08,579
- Instantaneous?
- Well, that's what we hoped for

750
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:10,920
and that's what we expected.
But the electrical force...

751
00:52:11,026 --> 00:52:13,517
We used huge amounts of energy
to create this bridge.

752
00:52:13,628 --> 00:52:14,754
All right, how huge?

753
00:52:14,863 --> 00:52:16,956
You remember that little blackout
we had a few years back?

754
00:52:17,065 --> 00:52:18,123
- Yes, I do.
- New York blamed Canada.

755
00:52:18,233 --> 00:52:19,393
- Right.
- Canada blamed Michigan.

756
00:52:19,501 --> 00:52:21,401
Half the Northeast.
You're saying you guys...

757
00:52:21,503 --> 00:52:23,528
- Fifty million homes. Right.
- My bad.

758
00:52:23,638 --> 00:52:25,299
Well, I still say we blame Canada, but...

759
00:52:25,407 --> 00:52:27,773
Okay, so why can't I see this bridge?

760
00:52:27,876 --> 00:52:30,276
It's not visible to the human eye.
I mean, it's real, though.

761
00:52:30,378 --> 00:52:31,572
It's just as real and just as solid

762
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,079
as a cell phone signal or a radio wave.

763
00:52:33,181 --> 00:52:35,479
Right. Well, I don't know
how a cell phone works.

764
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:39,178
I just know how to use it.
So how do we use this?

765
00:52:39,487 --> 00:52:40,852
We can look back four and a half days.

766
00:52:40,956 --> 00:52:43,789
- And what, we can look anywhere?
- Limited radius.

767
00:52:43,892 --> 00:52:45,951
Right, right, right.
Looking into the past.

768
00:52:46,061 --> 00:52:48,052
In a sense,
we're always looking in the past.

769
00:52:48,163 --> 00:52:50,791
Even light reflected
from yourself in the mirror

770
00:52:50,899 --> 00:52:52,366
takes some time to reflect back.

771
00:52:52,467 --> 00:52:53,434
Let me get this straight.

772
00:52:53,535 --> 00:52:57,369
You're trying to tell me
that on the other side of this bridge

773
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,534
- is the actual past?
- Yes.

774
00:52:59,641 --> 00:53:01,040
- Wow.
- DENNY: Yeah. But look, look, look.

775
00:53:01,142 --> 00:53:03,269
We created this thing by pure accident.
All right?

776
00:53:03,378 --> 00:53:07,906
This space and time...
This time window is a complete fluke.

777
00:53:08,249 --> 00:53:12,015
All right? And everybody is terrified
of screwing with it for fear of losing it

778
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,247
or suffering the consequences
of God knows what,

779
00:53:14,356 --> 00:53:16,347
which is why it can only be used
as a retroactive tool...

780
00:53:16,458 --> 00:53:18,585
Hey, let me ask you something.
Is she alive or is she dead?

781
00:53:18,693 --> 00:53:20,251
- You went to her funeral, Doug.
- I know that,

782
00:53:20,362 --> 00:53:23,354
but I think the question still applies.
Is she alive or is she dead?

783
00:53:23,465 --> 00:53:27,162
All right. Life, like time and space,
is not merely a local phenomenon.

784
00:53:27,268 --> 00:53:28,633
All right!

785
00:53:29,938 --> 00:53:31,803
Am I asking a hard question?

786
00:53:31,906 --> 00:53:34,374
(CLEARS THROAT) Looks like I picked
a bad week to stop snorting hash.

787
00:53:34,476 --> 00:53:35,670
All right, I tell you what.

788
00:53:35,777 --> 00:53:40,305
I'll speak slow, so those of you with
Ph.D.'s in the room can understand.

789
00:53:40,448 --> 00:53:42,643
It... Here. Look. Here's a monitor, right?

790
00:53:45,653 --> 00:53:48,679
Now the monitor is broken. It's dead.

791
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:52,590
It is not temporarily transitioned
to another state of entropy.

792
00:53:52,694 --> 00:53:57,859
It's dead, right?
Now, is she alive or is she dead?

793
00:53:58,033 --> 00:53:59,432
- She's alive.
- All right.

794
00:53:59,534 --> 00:54:00,501
Now we're getting somewhere.

795
00:54:00,602 --> 00:54:02,570
All right, now, you said
light could go back. What else?

796
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:04,228
- Nothing.
- Something else could be sent back.

797
00:54:04,339 --> 00:54:06,330
Come on, Paul. Something.
What? A body? A human being?

798
00:54:06,441 --> 00:54:08,534
- No.
- Not a person. Not alive, anyway.

799
00:54:08,643 --> 00:54:10,668
- Why not?
- Because you can't beat the physics.

800
00:54:10,779 --> 00:54:13,270
The electromagnetic field.
Look, you transition across

801
00:54:13,381 --> 00:54:15,212
what's known as
the Wheeler Boundary, all right?

802
00:54:15,316 --> 00:54:17,511
An EM pulse annihilates
all electrical activity.

803
00:54:17,619 --> 00:54:19,553
That's your heartbeat,
that's brainwaves, that's everything.

804
00:54:19,654 --> 00:54:21,519
So what? You haven't tried a person?

805
00:54:21,623 --> 00:54:22,885
Let's just say
that we've done enough tests

806
00:54:22,991 --> 00:54:24,925
to know that it's not even possible.

807
00:54:25,026 --> 00:54:27,586
It's not even theoretically possible.
The hamster goes back, dead.

808
00:54:27,695 --> 00:54:29,890
- A drosophila fly, dead.
- What about a radio signal?

809
00:54:29,998 --> 00:54:31,226
What about that?
We could send a radio...

810
00:54:31,332 --> 00:54:32,492
- A radio signal?
- Yeah, a radio signal.

811
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,431
- Won't work. Electrical.
- The field would scramble it.

812
00:54:34,536 --> 00:54:36,902
- All right, then a note, a warning note.
- No.

813
00:54:37,005 --> 00:54:38,700
- A single piece of paper. One sheet.
- No.

814
00:54:38,807 --> 00:54:40,240
- If we keep the mass low...
- No!

815
00:54:40,341 --> 00:54:41,433
This could work! It could work.

816
00:54:41,543 --> 00:54:42,771
Sure. We know
where the guy's gonna be.

817
00:54:42,877 --> 00:54:44,367
We can apprehend him
and put him away

818
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:45,468
before he even blows up the boat.

819
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,912
- And how do we do that, exactly?
- We send it to ourselves!

820
00:54:48,016 --> 00:54:50,541
You send it to me. Yeah, send it to me.
Send it to my office.

821
00:54:50,652 --> 00:54:52,586
Send it to my office
four and a half days ago,

822
00:54:52,687 --> 00:54:55,815
an anonymous tip, and we can capture
this guy before he even meets Claire.

823
00:54:55,924 --> 00:54:57,721
We know he's gonna be at the dock.

824
00:54:57,826 --> 00:54:58,952
Whatever you did, you did it already.

825
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:01,858
Whether you send this note or you
don't send this note, it doesn't matter.

826
00:55:01,963 --> 00:55:04,898
You cannot change the past.
It's physically impossible.

827
00:55:05,433 --> 00:55:07,458
What if there's more than physics?

828
00:55:09,504 --> 00:55:11,734
Okay. Something spiritual, right?

829
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,638
- Yeah, something spiritual.
- Okay, okay, okay. Look.

830
00:55:14,742 --> 00:55:16,175
Just try to think of it this way.

831
00:55:16,277 --> 00:55:18,302
God's mind is made up about this.
All right?

832
00:55:18,413 --> 00:55:21,041
I mean, you know,
call it fate, call it destiny, whatever.

833
00:55:21,149 --> 00:55:23,481
But it already happened,
it will keep happening,

834
00:55:23,585 --> 00:55:25,985
- and it always will happen.
- Maybe.

835
00:55:26,087 --> 00:55:28,351
And why don't we call it fate,
since we're calling it something?

836
00:55:28,456 --> 00:55:31,050
Maybe you're right. Maybe you guys
are exactly right. I don't know.

837
00:55:31,159 --> 00:55:33,389
All I know is this. For all of my career,

838
00:55:33,495 --> 00:55:36,589
I've been trying to catch people
after they do something horrible.

839
00:55:36,698 --> 00:55:37,722
For once in my life,

840
00:55:37,832 --> 00:55:40,392
I'd like to catch somebody
before they do something horrible.

841
00:55:40,502 --> 00:55:42,367
All right? Can you understand that?

842
00:55:47,609 --> 00:55:48,743
Address is in range.

843
00:55:48,743 --> 00:55:49,300
Address is in range.

844
00:55:54,282 --> 00:55:56,375
Two L's. "Surveilling," two L's.

845
00:55:57,852 --> 00:56:00,412
Since this is such a tremendous waste
of taxpayer money,

846
00:56:00,522 --> 00:56:02,080
the least we could do
is get the spelling right.

847
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:03,179
That's not necessarily true.

848
00:56:03,291 --> 00:56:04,986
Branching universe theory holds
that you can do...

849
00:56:05,093 --> 00:56:07,323
- Oh, branching universe theory.
- SHANTI: Look, hold it. All right.

850
00:56:07,428 --> 00:56:09,362
- No, no, no.
- I'll show you.

851
00:56:09,864 --> 00:56:11,627
The traditional view of time is linear,

852
00:56:11,733 --> 00:56:14,702
like a river flowing from the past
toward the future.

853
00:56:14,802 --> 00:56:16,793
But you can change
the course of a river, right?

854
00:56:16,905 --> 00:56:20,739
Exactly. Introduce a significant enough
event at any point in this river

855
00:56:20,842 --> 00:56:22,571
and you create a new branch,

856
00:56:22,677 --> 00:56:26,113
still flowing toward the future,
but along a different route.

857
00:56:26,214 --> 00:56:27,306
Changed.

858
00:56:27,415 --> 00:56:29,542
Yeah, but that river is the Mississippi,

859
00:56:29,651 --> 00:56:31,642
and we're lobbing
what amounts to a pebble into it.

860
00:56:31,753 --> 00:56:35,120
That's a very few tiny ripples in a kind
of big body of water, don't you think?

861
00:56:35,223 --> 00:56:36,656
Traditionalist.

862
00:56:36,758 --> 00:56:38,385
Say we do create this new branch.

863
00:56:38,493 --> 00:56:40,688
What happens to the old one?
To this one?

864
00:56:40,795 --> 00:56:42,353
Ask the radical.

865
00:56:43,298 --> 00:56:46,597
Well, it might continue
parallel to the new branch,

866
00:56:47,035 --> 00:56:49,094
but most likely it ceases to exist.

867
00:56:49,204 --> 00:56:51,695
The idea is, we cease to exist.

868
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:54,467
All right? This version of us, anyway.

869
00:56:55,143 --> 00:56:57,338
You know, we never came here.
We didn't meet Doug.

870
00:56:57,445 --> 00:56:59,936
We don't remember it ever happening.

871
00:57:00,048 --> 00:57:02,380
Well, that's worth $ 10 billion
right there.

872
00:57:07,355 --> 00:57:10,051
Would've been a lot faster
if you'd written it yourself.

873
00:57:10,158 --> 00:57:12,023
Right. Then I recognize
my own handwriting

874
00:57:12,126 --> 00:57:14,117
and the universe blows up.

875
00:57:30,044 --> 00:57:31,068
We're ready.

876
00:57:31,179 --> 00:57:34,546
All right, third floor, southwest corner.
That's where we are.

877
00:57:36,217 --> 00:57:37,707
<i>MINUTI: How'd you</i>
<i>get that information?</i>

878
00:57:37,819 --> 00:57:38,843
<i>CARLIN: Good police work.</i>

879
00:57:38,953 --> 00:57:39,942
That's me. I can hear me.

880
00:57:40,054 --> 00:57:41,544
- <i>I don't wanna play games with you.</i>
- Where am I?

881
00:57:41,656 --> 00:57:42,918
- <i>I'm not playing games.</i>
- <i>Yeah, you are.</i>

882
00:57:43,024 --> 00:57:44,719
- <i>No, I'm not.</i>
- <i>There are protocols... Yeah, you are.</i>

883
00:57:44,826 --> 00:57:47,124
- There I am.
- Is that Minuti?

884
00:57:47,228 --> 00:57:49,093
- <i>There's procedures...</i>
- Yep. That's my partner, Larry.

885
00:57:49,197 --> 00:57:51,324
<i>Look, I know how this job works,</i>
<i>you know how this job works.</i>

886
00:57:51,432 --> 00:57:53,297
Jesus, I forgot all about this part.

887
00:57:53,401 --> 00:57:56,336
All right, let's find a nice, happy place
to push the note onto.

888
00:57:56,437 --> 00:57:58,302
- That your desk?
- Yeah, that's my...

889
00:57:58,406 --> 00:57:59,998
Okay. Line us up.

890
00:58:00,308 --> 00:58:03,869
<i>When I peg a guy on a hunch,</i>
<i>that's good police work,</i>

891
00:58:03,978 --> 00:58:06,970
<i>not some conspiracy</i>
<i>to keep you out of the loop, all right?</i>

892
00:58:07,081 --> 00:58:09,311
- <i>You know what, Doug?</i>
- Okay, kid, start pushing.

893
00:58:09,417 --> 00:58:10,679
Expand the wave past the note.

894
00:58:10,785 --> 00:58:12,548
<i>I can't watch your back</i>
<i>if you're holding out on me.</i>

895
00:58:12,654 --> 00:58:13,643
<i>Why not?</i>

896
00:58:13,755 --> 00:58:15,780
If my memory serves me right,
we better hurry up,

897
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:17,414
'cause I think I'm about to leave.

898
00:58:17,525 --> 00:58:19,220
- I need more cowbell.
- GUNNARS: I'm trying.

899
00:58:19,327 --> 00:58:20,658
- <i>Okay, well, I...</i>
- Good!

900
00:58:20,762 --> 00:58:21,729
Just give me a second.

901
00:58:21,829 --> 00:58:23,990
- Don't talk to each other.
- DENNY: Expand.

902
00:58:24,098 --> 00:58:25,087
I'm about to leave.

903
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:26,826
<i>... another partner?</i>
<i>How about that? How about that?</i>

904
00:58:26,934 --> 00:58:28,526
- Everybody relax.
- <i>Okay. Yeah.</i>

905
00:58:28,636 --> 00:58:29,830
- Let's go.
- I'm working on it.

906
00:58:29,937 --> 00:58:31,598
Prepare for the final power surge.
Ready?

907
00:58:31,706 --> 00:58:34,971
- <i>Have a good vacation.</i>
- All right. Go, go, go!

908
00:58:36,644 --> 00:58:38,077
<i>Walk away.</i>

909
00:58:48,556 --> 00:58:49,580
PRYZWARRA:
What the hell happened?

910
00:58:49,691 --> 00:58:50,680
DENNY: I don't know.

911
00:58:50,792 --> 00:58:52,589
It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
Pull it back!

912
00:58:52,694 --> 00:58:54,321
- Did it go through?
- I don't know! I don't know!

913
00:58:54,462 --> 00:58:55,429
Pull it back.

914
00:59:03,805 --> 00:59:05,500
- There it is.
- It went through.

915
00:59:05,606 --> 00:59:07,039
- That's right.
- It's through.

916
00:59:07,141 --> 00:59:08,335
PRYZWARRA: It went through!
SHANTI: Great.

917
00:59:08,443 --> 00:59:10,070
Whoa, whoa.
No, wait a minute. Hang on.

918
00:59:10,178 --> 00:59:12,203
It ain't great yet. I don't come back.

919
00:59:27,195 --> 00:59:29,959
Put it down, Larry. I'm not coming back.

920
00:59:38,172 --> 00:59:39,867
Put it down, Larry.

921
00:59:41,109 --> 00:59:42,838
Larry, don't do it.

922
00:59:44,212 --> 00:59:45,873
- Follow him.
- I'm on him.

923
01:00:05,566 --> 01:00:09,525
All right, look, let's... You know what?
Let's cut away from Minuti.

924
01:00:09,637 --> 01:00:12,071
The bomber's on his way to the dock.
He's due there any minute.

925
01:00:12,173 --> 01:00:15,267
We'll come back to Minuti
when he gets there, all right?

926
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,279
All right.

927
01:00:21,048 --> 01:00:22,709
Okay, where is he?

928
01:00:26,621 --> 01:00:28,486
Can we circle it?

929
01:00:32,593 --> 01:00:35,118
We should be able to see him by now.

930
01:00:42,804 --> 01:00:44,669
That's him. There he is. All right.

931
01:00:44,772 --> 01:00:46,262
- Holy shit.
- CARLIN: All right.

932
01:00:46,374 --> 01:00:48,808
Move in on him real close.
I want to see his... That's him.

933
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:50,241
That's him.

934
01:00:51,979 --> 01:00:54,777
That's our guy. That's him.
At the bridge, the cemetery, the ATM.

935
01:00:54,882 --> 01:00:55,906
That's our guy.

936
01:00:56,017 --> 01:00:58,076
Shanti, see if you can get
an ID, facial ID on him.

937
01:00:58,186 --> 01:01:01,121
- Give me some time.
- Okay. All right. Take your time.

938
01:01:04,826 --> 01:01:06,885
- There's your partner.
- I see him.

939
01:01:06,994 --> 01:01:08,461
CARLIN: Try to move in on his truck.

940
01:01:08,563 --> 01:01:10,258
See if we can get a plate.

941
01:01:11,232 --> 01:01:13,223
- No plate.
- Get back on him.

942
01:01:17,505 --> 01:01:18,938
Stay on him.

943
01:01:23,678 --> 01:01:25,111
Where's Minuti?

944
01:01:25,213 --> 01:01:27,511
<i>Federal agent! Turn the engine off!</i>

945
01:01:27,615 --> 01:01:30,049
<i>Turn the engine off!</i>

946
01:01:32,353 --> 01:01:33,320
(CRYING)

947
01:01:44,732 --> 01:01:46,529
Tilt back down.

948
01:01:48,536 --> 01:01:50,333
GUNNARS: He's still breathing.

949
01:02:06,454 --> 01:02:09,981
- What can we do?
- I don't know what to do.

950
01:02:12,293 --> 01:02:15,091
He's traveling east.
He's traveling out of range.

951
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,860
- Okay, what can we do? Anything?
- I don't know,

952
01:02:17,965 --> 01:02:20,695
but if we don't do something fast,
I'm gonna lose this guy.

953
01:02:20,801 --> 01:02:22,462
SHANTI: We're losing the signal.

954
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:23,696
We have to boost the signal.

955
01:02:23,804 --> 01:02:26,034
We need to chase him
with the goggle rig.

956
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:27,801
Yeah, well,
Gunnars is a little busy right now,

957
01:02:27,909 --> 01:02:28,739
and he's the only one who can use it.

958
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,518
- Where is it?
- What, the rig? It's...

959
01:02:33,629 --> 01:02:36,496
- Yeah, the rig. Where is it?
- It's in his Hummer.

960
01:02:40,134 --> 01:02:41,999
- Keys in there?
- Yeah.

961
01:03:07,094 --> 01:03:08,083
(PHONE RINGING)

962
01:03:08,195 --> 01:03:10,254
All right, quiet, everybody. It's him.

963
01:03:10,965 --> 01:03:13,058
- Carlin.
- Where's he now?

964
01:03:13,234 --> 01:03:17,500
- Is he going east?
- Yes.

965
01:03:17,605 --> 01:03:19,163
Okay, he's going east,
going up on De Gaulle.

966
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:23,431
All right, just try to keep him in sight,
and keep feeding me directions.

967
01:03:23,541 --> 01:03:26,305
I'll try and track him with this goggle rig.

968
01:03:26,411 --> 01:03:28,606
- Can he do that?
- Yeah, if he can catch up to the image

969
01:03:28,713 --> 01:03:31,204
and keep him in sight, that could work.

970
01:03:34,285 --> 01:03:35,980
Hey, how do you turn this thing on?

971
01:03:36,087 --> 01:03:39,022
There's an on-off button
on the back of the rig.

972
01:03:39,124 --> 01:03:40,091
Okay, I see it.

973
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,955
It's really simple. Wherever you look,
the eyepiece will auto-focus,

974
01:03:43,061 --> 01:03:45,120
and we'll see what you see.

975
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,633
Okay, you're live. You're on.

976
01:03:50,735 --> 01:03:53,260
- <i>PRYZWARRA: Try the goggles.</i>
- Hang on, hang on.

977
01:03:57,142 --> 01:03:59,702
- He's gone. Out of range.
- What?

978
01:03:59,811 --> 01:04:02,473
- Where's he headed?
- <i>SHANTI: He's headed toward the l</i>- <i>10.</i>

979
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:04,172
East or west?

GUNNARS: I don't know.
SHANTI: I don't know.

East or west?

982
01:04:08,586 --> 01:04:10,383
We lost the signal. We're blind in here.

- <i>SHANTI: I don't know.</i>
- All right, hang on.

Oh, shit!

985
01:04:19,264 --> 01:04:21,960
What? What happened?
What happened?

986
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,096
This is trippy.

987
01:04:29,207 --> 01:04:30,333
Doug, look straight ahead.

988
01:04:30,442 --> 01:04:31,909
We've got the window slaved
to your goggles.

989
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:35,036
We are seeing what you're seeing
four days in the past.

990
01:04:36,548 --> 01:04:38,448
Okay, I got him. I got him.
He's back in range.

991
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:40,017
He's going west, not east,

992
01:04:40,118 --> 01:04:42,052
<i>on the Crescent City Bridge.</i>

993
01:04:44,823 --> 01:04:47,155
There he is. That's him. Opposite lane.

994
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:49,851
- CARLIN: I got him.
- That's him. That's him.

995
01:04:49,961 --> 01:04:51,360
I got him!

996
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:54,394
Watch the traffic.

997
01:05:03,641 --> 01:05:05,472
- What was that?
- I think he hit something.

998
01:05:08,913 --> 01:05:12,349
SHANTI: Doug, you've gotta stay

01:18:01,764 --> 01:18:04,130
Lawrence Minuti. My partner.
You shot him.

1165
01:18:04,233 --> 01:18:07,202
He... I was about to burn him
and he was waking up, you know?

1166
01:18:07,303 --> 01:18:08,895
I mean, I'm not cruel.

1167
01:18:11,407 --> 01:18:15,545
Well, why didn't you "do that"
for Claire Kuchever?

1168
01:18:17,246 --> 01:18:22,707
Well, because I needed her
to look like a ferry victim,

1169
01:18:22,819 --> 01:18:24,020
- and a bullet would've given it away.
- I see.

1170
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:25,180
- And a bullet would've given it away.
- I see.

1171
01:18:25,288 --> 01:18:28,621
I went to her house
on the pretense of buying her car.

1172
01:18:28,724 --> 01:18:31,955
I took her from behind, taped her mouth
and threw a hood over her head.

1173
01:18:32,061 --> 01:18:33,028
Then?

1174
01:18:33,129 --> 01:18:36,155
<i>I bound her wrists and her ankles</i>
<i>and I drove her back to my place.</i>

1175
01:18:36,265 --> 01:18:38,096
<i>I loaded the device into her car</i>

1176
01:18:38,201 --> 01:18:39,759
<i>and then I soaked her</i>
<i>with the gasoline.</i>

1177
01:18:39,869 --> 01:18:40,961
Jesus.

1178
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:42,094
And?

1179
01:18:42,338 --> 01:18:43,737
I think you know
what happened after that.

1180
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,740
No, I don't know. I want you to tell me.
You gotta talk.

1181
01:18:45,842 --> 01:18:47,867
I mean, you know, come on, hero.
What happened after that?

1182
01:18:47,977 --> 01:18:49,137
I'll tell you what happened after that.

1183
01:18:49,245 --> 01:18:52,681
You killed 543 people.
How do you feel about that?

1184
01:18:57,820 --> 01:19:01,449
I think that you were a murderer
right from the beginning.

1185
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:07,521
Sometimes a little human collateral
is the cost of freedom.

1186
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:09,495
To me,
those people were war casualties,

1187
01:19:09,599 --> 01:19:11,499
<i>but to you, they're just evidence.</i>

1188
01:19:11,601 --> 01:19:14,035
That'll do. We got him.

1189
01:19:14,136 --> 01:19:15,103
<i>CARLIN: What'd you say?</i>

1190
01:19:15,338 --> 01:19:19,069
You think you know what's coming?
You don't have a clue.

1191
01:19:19,175 --> 01:19:21,166
I know where you're going.

1192
01:19:21,577 --> 01:19:25,240
I know you're gonna be away
for a long time. I know that.

1193
01:19:26,249 --> 01:19:28,740
- This case will never even go to trial.
- No?

1194
01:19:30,286 --> 01:19:33,312
- 'Cause I seen what's coming.
- Did... Have you? What?

1195
01:19:34,090 --> 01:19:37,253
What is in this glass?
You've seen what's coming, huh?

1196
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,453
Okay, what's coming? You tell me.

1197
01:19:40,429 --> 01:19:43,091
I told you earlier I have a destiny,

1198
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:44,530
a purpose.

1199
01:19:45,234 --> 01:19:48,328
Satan reasons like man,
but God thinks of eternity.

1200
01:19:48,905 --> 01:19:53,433
Well, I prostrate myself before a world
that's going to hell in a handbag,

1201
01:19:53,542 --> 01:19:56,636
'cause in all eternity,
I am here and I will be remembered.

1202
01:19:56,746 --> 01:19:58,338
That's destiny.

1203
01:19:59,048 --> 01:20:00,811
A bomb has a destiny,

1204
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:04,410
a predetermined fate
set by the hand of its creator.

1205
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:07,819
And anyone who tries to alter
that destiny will be destroyed.

1206
01:20:07,924 --> 01:20:11,291
Anyone who tries to stop it
from happening will cause it to happen.

1207
01:20:11,394 --> 01:20:13,294
And that's what you don't understand.

1208
01:20:13,396 --> 01:20:17,230
We're not here to coexist.
I'm here to win.

1209
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,433
So you'd better have
some divine intervention, buddy.

1210
01:20:21,237 --> 01:20:23,364
You're gonna need it.

1211
01:20:23,673 --> 01:20:27,200
You'd better have some K-Y.
You're gonna need it.

1212
01:20:39,121 --> 01:20:41,146
What am I supposed to do?

1213
01:20:42,525 --> 01:20:44,925
- We're shutting you down.
- What?

1214
01:20:45,428 --> 01:20:46,417
Yeah, we got what we need.

1215
01:20:46,529 --> 01:20:48,997
The forensics, the suspect,
a confession. We're done.

1216
01:20:49,098 --> 01:20:52,590
Sir, perhaps we should continue
and watch the actual crime.

1217
01:20:52,702 --> 01:20:54,226
- The ferry bombing.
- Right. He's right.

1218
01:20:54,337 --> 01:20:56,464
I mean, we can't just
go on the confession alone.

1219
01:20:56,572 --> 01:20:58,802
We need an airtight case.
We need to collect more evidence.

1220
01:20:58,908 --> 01:21:01,172
Well, collecting evidence
would've been fine, Agent Carly.

1221
01:21:01,277 --> 01:21:03,837
- You took it a little further than that.
- Agent Carlin. Carlin.

1222
01:21:03,946 --> 01:21:05,038
My name is Carlin, not Carly.

1223
01:21:05,147 --> 01:21:07,707
We had protocols in place.
There's strict protocols.

1224
01:21:07,817 --> 01:21:10,513
And then you had to push it,
and now an agent's dead.

1225
01:21:10,619 --> 01:21:12,883
Sir, by one theory,
that already happened.

1226
01:21:12,989 --> 01:21:16,254
We're done. Power it down.
Pack it up. On to the next case.

1227
01:21:16,993 --> 01:21:18,756
- What about Claire?
- What...

1228
01:21:19,328 --> 01:21:21,319
Lookit, charging Oerstadt
in the Kuchever murder

1229
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:24,024
is gonna raise too many questions
about how we obtained the evidence.

1230
01:21:24,133 --> 01:21:25,532
I understand that, sir,
but what about Claire?

1231
01:21:25,634 --> 01:21:26,692
Are we just gonna drop the case?

1232
01:21:26,802 --> 01:21:29,236
We got him on the ferry bombing,
we got him on killing a federal agent.

1233
01:21:29,338 --> 01:21:31,636
- That's enough to get him the needle.
- I cannot accept that, sir.

1234
01:21:31,741 --> 01:21:34,209
Well, you know, I don't give a rat's ass
what you can accept.

1235
01:21:34,310 --> 01:21:36,744
- She doesn't matter.
- He's gonna kill her.

1236
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:40,571
- In 12 hours, he's gonna kill her.
- He killed her four days ago.

1237
01:21:40,683 --> 01:21:43,345
You were at the funeral.
What's wrong with you?

1238
01:21:47,289 --> 01:21:48,847
It had to happen.

1239
01:21:48,991 --> 01:21:52,324
I delayed turning in my report
till we caught the guy.

1240
01:21:53,029 --> 01:21:54,724
Hey, mission accomplished.

1241
01:21:55,197 --> 01:21:57,324
This is a victory, Doug.

1242
01:22:04,373 --> 01:22:07,399
Hey. Now, my job is closure.

1243
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:10,035
Your job is to help facilitate
that closure.

1244
01:22:10,146 --> 01:22:12,410
Then you tell me,
what do I tell her father?

1245
01:22:12,515 --> 01:22:14,574
We caught the son of a bitch.

1246
01:22:14,683 --> 01:22:15,809
We can't save the victims.

1247
01:22:15,918 --> 01:22:19,183
It's not our job
to make the relatives feel better.

1248
01:22:19,588 --> 01:22:23,752
We lose everything that we care about.
Those are your words.

1249
01:22:24,827 --> 01:22:27,819
Doug, it's not your fault
that Claire dies.

1250

Yeah, I know. EM field, flatline. I got it.

Thing of it is,
no matter how clever we think we are,

1284
01:26:02,544 --> 01:26:05,104
the most probable outcome
of our little experiment

1285
01:26:05,214 --> 01:26:08,945
is that four and a half days ago
you get a call from the coroner's office.

1286

"Hey, Agent Carlin,
I want you to come down here.

"There's something you should see."

1288

You only gotta be right once.

Besides, I think I'd remember
if that happened, right?

1292
01:26:25,934 --> 01:26:27,959
So I gotta face out toward you?

1293

I don't understand.

Why not just call the police
and have them arrest him at the dock?

1491
01:42:56,086 --> 01:42:58,384
He'll set the bomb off
right there on the spot.

1492
01:42:58,489 --> 01:43:00,013
He can't know he's been compromised

until it's too late for him
to do anything about it.

1494
01:43:02,226 --> 01:43:04,956
He'll set the timer, walk away on foot,
get on his motorcycle

and ride to the Crescent City Bridge
to watch.

You defuse the bomb?

all right?

- They better believe you.

- They won't arrest you.

You'll be fine. That's a good thing.
