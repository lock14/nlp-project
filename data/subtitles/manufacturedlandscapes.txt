00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,532
Man: Is there some way
I can actually talk about nature...

3
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:41,267
and kind of bring
a certain appreciation...

4
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,741
for what it represents?

5
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:49,076
That we come from nature, and that
we have to understand what it is...

6
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:53,084
so as not to harm it
and then to ultimately harm ourselves.

7
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:58,146
That there is an importance to have
a certain reverence for what nature is...

8
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,658
because we are connected to it
and we are part of it.

9
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,559
And if we destroy nature,
we destroy ourselves.

10
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:08,725
So I believe that as a fundamental
philosophical position...

11
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,803
when I look at the world.

12
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:13,631
So I started thinking, well...

13
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,039
maybe the new landscape of our time,
the one to start to talk about...

14
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,475
is the landscape that we change.

15
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,844

16
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,076
in pursuit of progress.

17
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:28,347
So, I'm trying to look at...

18
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,922
the industrial landscape...

19
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,321
as a way of defining who we are...

20
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,394
and our relationship to the planet.

21
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,457
It's— It's just this thing that's just
growing, and it's part of our economy...

22
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,763
and it's part of our politics, and it's a part
of how we elect our governments.

23
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,770
It's part of everything we do.

24
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,363
But it's this big machine
that started rolling...

25
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:52,274
and I'm not coming at it...

26
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:56,041
to celebrate or glorify the industry,
nor am I trying to damn it.

27
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:59,084
I'm just trying to say,
"Well, this is what it is".

28
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,378
So to show those types of images
of those types of places...

29
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,617
allows the viewer...

30
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:11,424
to begin to comprehend the scale.

31
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,960

It is a landscape.

Every time we worked on 7562,
if I didn't remind you,

47
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:09,167
then nobody would label the bad items,
so they got messed up.

And I think, quite frankly...

80
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,901
that's where I started.

81
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,497
I had a bit of an epiphany
being lost in Pennsylvania.

82
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,975
I took a left turn trying to
get back to the highway...

83
00:14:38,976 --> 00:14:40,976
and ended up in a town
called Frackville.

84
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,541
And I got out of the car and I stood up,
and it was a coal mining town...

85
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,312
and I did a 360 turnaround...

86
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:51,549
and that became one of the most
surreal landscapes I had ever seen.

87
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,648
Totally transformed by man.

88
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,727
And that— that got me to—

89
00:14:55,828 --> 00:15:00,390
to go out and look at the largest
industrial incursions that I could find.

90
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,798
And that became the baseline
of what I was doing.

91
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,348
Edward: I guess in the back of
everybody's mind,

92
00:15:59,349 --> 00:16:00,949
when you think of
extraction industries...

93
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,791
that we all know that
stuff comes from somewhere,

94
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:04,792
but we're disconnected from that.

95
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:09,257
So my images brought those landscapes
into our consciousness...

96
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,633
and for about ten years
I explored that kind of landscape...

97
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:17,004
through quarries and mines—
nickel or copper or iron ore.

98
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:20,636
And ones that had been going on
for long periods of time...

99
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,873
so that the evidence
of that accumulated taking—

100
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,746
in one frame
you can show the dimensions...

103
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,542

where all these materials coalesce...

104
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,045
and so they're coming in
from all around the world—

105
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:13,676
iron ore and aluminium
and, uh, wood.

All these things that China
has very little of.

107
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,490
And then these factories
are this place...

108

get formed into products...

Burtynsky: The other aspect
of what's happening in China...

118
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,634
is that a lot of the recycled materials
that are collected here...

00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:54,060

is that they actually heat up the boards...

126
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,794
and with pairs of pliers
they pull off all the components.

They're trying to get all the valued metals
out of those components.

of burning of the boards...

when I began to photograph

what I call an oil epiphany...

about how oil had affected my life...

of the last century.

00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:05,307

I thought of it as the oil party—

264
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:09,181
that, you know, there's this
great abundance of black liquid...

265
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:12,153

this freedom.

267
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:18,789
that, you know, China was kind of
either joining the last dance...

268

to this party...

of the world...

275
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:42,418
is a very different energy footprint.

late in the game...

00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:55,363
It's created a reservoir
600 kilometers long...

338
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:58,559
one of the largest reservoirs
ever created.

339
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:01,796
And it's actually a relief
for what's going on in China...

340
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,873
because, I think,
on the table right now...

341
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:08,172
there's 27 nuclear power stations
to be built in the next 10 years...

342
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:12,044
and coal-burning furnaces
are going in there for electric power...

343
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:14,116
literally weekly.

Woman On P. A: [Speaking Chinese]

346
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:43,165
Workers, before you go to the site,

347
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:48,175
please check that you are wearing
safety equipment or proper clothing.

348
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:52,246
Please check if
there's any potential danger

349
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:56,251
and if you are clear about today's work.

350
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:08,223
Today's highest temperature:
26 to 27 centigrade; lowest: 15 to 16.

- Yes.</i>

- <i>Are you working here?</i>
- Yes.</i>

354
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:26,111
<i>How about the work? Is it hard?</i>

355
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,817
Of course it's hard.

356
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:31,810
- 20 Yuan.
- <i>What?</i></i>

357
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,983
20, uh, 30 Yuan.

358
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:39,488
<i>So, 30 Yuan a day? Oh.</i>

359
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:46,093
Woman: [Chinese Continues]
<i>What do you think of this project?</i></i>

360
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:50,263
<i>Are you proud of your involvement
on such a huge project?</i>

361
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:53,567
Man: [Speaking Chinese]
I'm just a general labourer here.

362
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:56,238
We are just working for our boss,
getting paid here.

363
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:04,785
We have three shifts a day:
day shift, mid shift and night shift.

364
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:05,422
Woman: [Speaking Chinese]

365
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:07,449
<i>How long have you
been working here?</i>

366
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:08,479
I've been working here nine years.

367
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:10,850
<i>Nine years? Wow.</i>

368
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:18,326
It's just work. It's all for our country.

369
00:58:05,516 --> 00:58:07,111
Man: [Speaking Chinese]

370
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:11,814
The project was officially launched
on December 14, 1994.

371
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:16,319
It has been almost ten years.

372
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:22,088
It will take 17 years to finish,
ending in 2009.

373
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:30,464
This is the biggest dam
that has ever been made in the world

374
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:33,974
and probably ever will be made.

375
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:36,738
There are three main functions
of the dam.

376
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:40,213
The first is to avoid floods.
That's the most crucial function.

377
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:43,843
The second
is to generate electricity.

378
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:47,013
The third
is to improve transportation.

379
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:50,719
That's it.

380
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:09,437
The full length of the dam
is 2,309 metres.

381
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:15,877
There will be
26 generators installed...

382
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:25,585
as well as 6 underground generators,
as back-up, which makes 32 total.

383
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:34,030
Each one generates 700,000 kW,
with a total capacity of 22,400,000 kW

384
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:41,134
which supplies 84.7 billion kWh per year.

385

Woman: [Speaking Chinese]

386
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:10,072
<i>How many people have to relocate
due to the construction of the dam?</i>

387
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:10,975
Man: [Speaking Chinese]

388
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:17,912
According to the statistics
we got in the 1992 census, 830,000,

389
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:23,975
but considering population growth,
the actual amount is around 1,100,000.

390
01:00:24,922 --> 01:00:26,455
Woman: [Speaking Chinese]

391
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,323
<i>Are these people content
with their new homes?</i>

392
01:00:29,327 --> 01:00:30,895
Man: [Speaking Chinese]

393
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:35,689
Do not ask me this question.
I'm not in charge of this.

394
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:37,665
Take a look at that.

395
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:39,632
Man:
Oh, wow.

396
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:51,336
Burtynsky: So I made three trips
to the Three Gorges Dam...

397
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:54,473
looking at that massive transformation
of a landscape.

398
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:57,781
And it's not— It looks like
a bombed-out landscape, but it isn't.

399
01:00:57,887 --> 01:01:02,153
It—What it is— It's a landscape
that is an intentional one.

400
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:04,158
This is a need for power...

401
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:08,458
and they're moving 13 full-sized cities
up out of the reservoir...

402
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:11,533
and flattening all the buildings
so they can make way for the ships.

403
01:01:11,634 --> 01:01:13,932
And it was all the people
who lived in those homes...

404
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:17,131
were the ones that were actually working
and getting paid, per brick...

405
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,505
to take their cities apart.

406
01:01:20,575 --> 01:01:23,573

[Hammering Of Picks]

408
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:41,950
I want to go back through
to shoot with some different lights.

409
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:44,117
Man: Yeah, this is spectacular.
Good find, Jeff.

410
01:02:57,673 --> 01:02:59,971
[Crumbling Of Bricks]

411
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:06,830
Burtynsky: This—This will all be over
in another three weeks or a month.

412
01:05:06,936 --> 01:05:09,734
And it's here for the moment, and once
they're through this rubble, it's finished...

413
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,739
then the water floods it.

414
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:15,174
So there's this crazy, frenetic activity
for the next month or two...

415
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:17,906
and then it's gone forever, so—

416
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,400
Okay.

417
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:43,070
Okay.

418
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,450
Okay.

419
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,660
Okay.

420
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:14,767

Well, I think it's all— It'll be okay.

421

I need that Polaroid.

422
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:22,638
Man: [Speaking Chinese]
It's a very broad view.

423
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:24,976
It's hard to see the details.

424
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:32,254
Burtynsky:
Keep working on the shot.

This model has 600 square meters...

426
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:15,652
in a scale of 1 to 500.

427
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:18,386
It's the biggest of its kind
in the world...

428
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:20,792
so it set a Guinness record.

429
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:24,994
The planning
is from 2001 to 2020...

430
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,001
so 20 years' planning.

431
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,901
Now we also have 50 years' planning.

432
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:34,032
First we see this blue river
is Huang-p'u River.

433
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:36,805
Here, this is Huang-p'u River.

434
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:40,973
And in the eastern side
is called Pudong area.

435
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:42,983
Pudong area.

436
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:47,078
The western side is called Puxi area.

437
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:49,453
Burtynsky:
When Mao finished his reign...

438
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:53,050
there was 90% agrarian and 10% urban.

439
01:08:53,162 --> 01:08:55,824
Uh, the current idea
coming from Beijing...

440
01:08:55,931 --> 01:09:01,699
is to see it 30% agrarian
and 70% urban...

441
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:05,069
which, when you look at 1.3 billion—

442
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:08,906
The urbanization of China...

443
01:09:09,011 --> 01:09:11,980
um, is unprecedented
in the world.

444
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,117
Woman:
...meters, 88 stories...

445
01:09:15,217 --> 01:09:18,414
now the highest building of Shanghai.

446
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:21,081
This building is under construction.

447
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:24,523
The name is World Financial Center.

448
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:26,595
When this building finished...

449
01:09:26,695 --> 01:09:29,789
they will have 492 meters...

450
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:31,867
101 stories.

451
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:35,835
In the future, they will become
the highest building of Shanghai.

452
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:40,397
Here is Century Park.
Century Park.

453
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:45,139
Behind Century Park, we will see
many white, small buildings.

454
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:47,715
And here is Villa Garden.
Villa area.

455
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:53,410
Burtynsky: One of the things I focused on
in terms of the urbanization of China...

456
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:58,050
was Shanghai, in that Shanghai
is probably China's fastest-growing city.

457
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,094
In the last five years...

458
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:05,156
it's had about four to five million
new citizens arrive.

459
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:09,571
And it's growing
in this kind of crazy fashion...

460
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:14,609
in that thousands and thousands
of high-rise dwellings...

461
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:17,736
are replacing the older,
traditional dwellings...

462
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:19,814
that were there.

463
01:10:56,353 --> 01:10:57,881
Man: [Speaking Chinese]

464
01:10:57,886 --> 01:11:06,794
Because our country was poor in the
past, people's life standards were low.

465
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:13,792
Compared with the old city,
the new city has been improved

466
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:16,594
regarding the scale
and construction quality.

467
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:27,978
Generally speaking, life quality
has been improved as well.

468
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:34,853
Because people feel happy
about the fresh environment.

469
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:50,632
Woman: So the garden's
about 1,800 square meter.

470
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:54,368
So I have two gardener
come every day...

471
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:57,604
to keep these plant all lovely.

472
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:05,544
Actually, in the evening,
when all this light on the garden...

473
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:07,849
really look beautiful.

474
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:09,856
Quiet.

475
01:12:26,975 --> 01:12:30,433
Since I am
in the real estate business...

476
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:33,913
I visit lots of property...

477
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,314
and...

478
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:38,386
Shanghai developed really quickly.

479
01:12:38,487 --> 01:12:41,684
Really, I think
the fastest city in the world.

480
01:12:42,759 --> 01:12:44,286
Woman: [Speaking Chinese]

481
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:47,254

that you can wash your dog?

[Speaking Chinese]

483
01:12:52,434 --> 01:12:55,699
These houses were
basically old houses.

484
01:12:55,804 --> 01:13:00,639
We were old neighbours.
We've been neighbours for decades.

485
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:11,316
My father and mother grew up here...

486
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:16,920
and I was born here.

487
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:19,250
I'm more than 60 years old now.

488
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:32,830
Woman:
You see, this open kitchen here...

489
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:35,535
actually was my garage.

490
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:41,915
Originally, this house
looked totally different.

491
01:13:42,017 --> 01:13:44,110
[Chiming]

492
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:50,090
This is the study room.

493
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:57,565
I spend lots of time here.

494
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:04,472
This is my favorite bookshelf.

495
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:07,269
This is antique style.
Chinese antique style.

496
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:10,106

498
01:14:23,392 --> 01:14:26,884
Go further. You will find
an interesting place to shoot.

499
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:37,772
Woman: I think the Shanghai city
is, more or less, for the younger people...

500
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:40,341
younger generation.

501
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:57,325
Some older generations,
they are not happy...

502
01:14:57,426 --> 01:15:00,418
because they are feeling their hearts
still belong to the old place.

503
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:02,963
This is everywhere in the world, same.

01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:14,067
They came door to door
to persuade you to move, one by one;

506
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:17,377
sometimes they
deceived people into going.

507
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:19,106
Sometimes they coaxed them.

508
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:38,991
Woman: I bought a property,
um, close by here...

509
01:15:39,101 --> 01:15:41,035
called Xi Zhou Hua Cheng.

510
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:44,731
And they— they could not build
the property which they promised us.

511
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:49,436
The reason was they needed longer time
to convince old lady, you know...

512
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:52,912
to— to move just a little bit, maybe...

513
01:15:53,015 --> 01:15:54,983
away from, you know, the area.

514
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:58,211
Even ten minutes. But she just did not.

515
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,220
It was impossible for her.

516
01:16:03,193 --> 01:16:04,761
Man: [Speaking Chinese]

517
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:12,255
Often they beat people up.
One guy here got broken bones.

518
01:16:18,607 --> 01:16:22,566
Woman: The whole community
was knocked down but this house.

519
01:16:23,612 --> 01:16:25,978
She just didn't want to leave.

520
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:07,982
Burtynsky: We are changing
the nature of this planet.

521
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:10,381
We are changing the air,
we are changing the water...

522
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:12,453
we are changing the land.

523
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:16,824
And that's just not China.
That's the world at large.

524
01:19:10,812 --> 01:19:13,679
Burtynsky: There are times
when I have thought about my work...

525
01:19:13,782 --> 01:19:16,876
and putting it into a more
politicized environment.

526
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:26,058
If I said, "This is a terrible thing
that we're doing to the planet"...

527
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:29,028
then people will either
agree or disagree.

528
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:32,192
By not saying what you should see...

529
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:35,736
that may allow them to look at something
that they never looked at...

530
01:19:35,837 --> 01:19:38,431
and to see their world a little differently.

531
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:42,869
So I think many people today...

532
01:19:42,978 --> 01:19:46,641
sit in that uncomfortable spot...

533
01:19:46,748 --> 01:19:50,445
where, you know, we don't necessarily
want to give up what we have...

534
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:53,146
but we realize what we're doing...

535
01:19:53,255 --> 01:19:56,156
is creating problems that run deep.

536
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:06,457
It's not a simple right or wrong.

537
01:20:07,502 --> 01:20:09,800
It needs a whole new way of thinking.
