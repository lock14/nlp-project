<i>This is
my friend Harry Allen.</i>

28
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,300
<i>He's married.</i>

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,100
<i>He likes his wife.</i>

30
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,100
<i>It can happen.</i>

31
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,400
I'm sorry, Mr. Allen,
were you calling for me?

32
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,800
Yes, Miss Jones.

33
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,600
Get Mr. Langley
on the phone for me.

34
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,600
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.

35
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,200
<i>Myself? I always thought marriage
was a mild kind of illness.</i>

36
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,200
<i>Like the flu or chickenpox,</i>

37
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,200
<i>to which I was
safely immune.</i>

38
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,400
<i>It all began on
the 5th of September, 1949,</i>

39
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,200
<i>when Harry called to ask me
to lunch at the Cloud Room,</i>

40
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,700
<i>saying he had something
urgent he wished to tell me.</i>

41
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,100
So, what's so
damn important?

42
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,200
To our mutual
good health.

43
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,800
Uh-huh.

44
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,100
You're not dying on me or
something, old chap, are you?

45
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,200
No.

46
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,200
Just the opposite.

47
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,500
So?

48
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,400
Let's grab a table before
it gets too crowded.

49
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,700
Do you like Pat, Rich?

50
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,100
I mean,
are you fond of her?

51
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,200
Of course I like Pat.
She's your wife.

52
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,200
You know I'm fond of her.

53
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,800
Since the day I met her.

54
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,300
Of course.

55
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,400
What are you getting at?

56
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Well, I'm going
to leave Pat.

57
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,200
And I thought
I'd better tell you.

58
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,600
I thought you
ought to know.

59
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,900
Why, may I ask,
are you gonna leave Pat?

60
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,900
Because I want
to be truly happy.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,400
Oh. That sounds
reasonable.

62
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,800
I'm being
very reasonable.

63
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,500
Well, what's her name?

64
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,200
Look, I know you and Pat
well enough to figure

65
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,000
your marriage is
not an unhappy one.

66
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,300
As a matter of fact,
as marriages go,

67
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,300
I always thought
it was pretty good.

68
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,300
The most successful marriage
I've ever known.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,200
Her name is Kay.

70
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,700
It's Kay Nesbitt.

71
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,000
Pat will take it hard.

72
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,400
I know. I tried
telling her. I couldn't.

73
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,900
I can't stand to
see anyone suffer.

74
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
You know how I am.

75
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,300
Why don't you have Kay,
if you want,

76
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,400
as your girlfriend?

77
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,300
Just to make sure.

78
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,900
What, you mean
as a mistress?

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,200
Just to make sure.

80
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,600
I am sure.

81
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,700
I always dreamed of a woman being
really in love with me, Richard.

82
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,200
For Pat, love means
only one thing.

83
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,800
And what is that?

84
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,900
Sex.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,600
All the rest of it, the romantic
dreams, the self-deception,

86
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,200
what you always call
"the wish to give and give," Harry,

87
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,300
it all boils down
to that. Bed.

88
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,800
Love is sex.

89
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,800
The rest is affection
and companionship.

90
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,500
You're wrong.

91
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,100
You're completely
and utterly wrong.

92
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,600
Well, you're a romantic
and sentimental fool.

93
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,100
If you don't want the truth,
you shouldn't ask me questions.

94
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,300
But I do love you,
darling.

95
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,800
I do. Really.

96
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,600
And you know
I find you as attractive

97
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,800
as that very first night
we danced together.

98
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,400
I know you do.

99
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,400
Perhaps I'm not made
like other women.

100
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,200
I don't know.

101
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,900
I've tried to be
a good wife to you.

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,700
<i>From the day
we were married,</i>

103
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
she committed herself,

104
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,900
she came to life.

105
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,200
But physically only.

106
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,400
Only physically, Richard.

107
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,900
I know some men
crave that sex,

108
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,300
but I want more.

109
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,600
We all have to put up with
something in life, Harry.

110
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
We can't have everything.

111
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,200
You can't possibly
understand.

112
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,100
You're with a different woman
every other week.

113
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,300
I'm going to have to
find a way to leave Pat.

114
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,100
I have to.

115
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,100
I've made up my mind.

116
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,700
<i>Dear, sweet, gentle Kay.</i>

117
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,500
<i>What on earth drew a girl
like you to my friend Harry?</i>

118
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,200
<i>That I could
never understand.</i>

119
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,000
<i>Maybe you were lonely.</i>

120
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,900
<i>Maybe you were smitten.</i>

121
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,400
<i>In truth, who can ever
explain a woman's desire?</i>

122
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,300
<i>It's always been
a bit of a mystery.</i>

123
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,400
<i>It was the next Sunday
that, as habit,</i>

124
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,500
<i>Harry and Pat walked to have
lunch with their daughter Becky,</i>

125
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,300
<i>her husband Tom and their
grandson, little Charlie.</i>

126
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,600
Good afternoon.

127
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,500
Hello.

128
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,000
That awful dog.

129
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,000
That awful woman.

130
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,100
Poor old
Mrs. Walsh.

131
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,900
So I said, "What you have is an
inability to express your emotions.

132
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,200
"You're frigid in
a Freudian sense,"

133
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,700
which completely confused
her, the poor woman.

134
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,300
So I told her that without
a very serious analysis,

135
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,100
she would never
get over it.

136
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,500
We talked about her
childhood for an hour.

137
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,400
<i>Harry was already looking
forward to his evening with Kay.</i>

138
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,800
<i>He'd made all
the proper arrangements.</i>

139
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,200
<i>All his excuses
were lined up.</i>

140
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,500
<i>It has always been the
privilege of the well-to-do</i>

141
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,100
<i>to use their business
as camouflage.</i>

142
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,400
Gotta go.

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,600
Harry, it's Sunday.

144
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Duty calls, darling.

145
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,000
I need to get a head start
on tomorrow's meetings.

146
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,200
<i>So be it.
It is on your own head.</i>

147
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,500
<i>But when evil
comes to you...</i>

148
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,800
I appreciate the television
set, darling, I do.

149
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,800
That's all
I want to do, Kay.

150
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,300
I want to spoil you,

151
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,600
and shower you
with gifts,

152
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,900
and give and give.

153
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,800
Just to see you smile.

154
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,100
I love that smile.

155
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,000
Harry,
you're such a romantic.

156
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,800
That's why I love you.

157
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,400
<i>He had to get out
of his marriage.</i>

158
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,200
<i>He had to have Kay.</i>

159
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
<i>But how?</i>

160
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,400
<i>He couldn't stand to shatter
Pat's world and make her suffer.</i>

161
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,800
You know, the other
week at the cabin,

162
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,800
John O'Brien was
telling Newt Baum

163
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,100
that he thinks a woman
who does a lot for her man

164
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,900
can pay a heavy price.

165
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What do you suppose
he meant?

166
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,200
Oh, it's all rather
uncomplicated, I'm sure.

167
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,600
He was drinking.
You know John.

168
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,900
What is the price
a good wife pays?

169
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,900
Tell me.

170
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,900
I don't know.

171
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,400
Let's skip it. You'll
upset your stomach.

172
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
No, go on.

173
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,800
I'd say he was
probably thinking that

174
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,800
if a married man

175
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,800
falls in love
with another woman,

176
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,800
the dedicated wife is
surprised and hurt.

177
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,800
And she remembers
him as he was.

178
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,300
Before they married,
and she sees him now,

179
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,000
as she made him.

180
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,800
A better-finished
product altogether.

181
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,400
A product another woman
is soon going to enjoy.

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,200
You've given this
a lot of thought.

183
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I know you don't
love me anymore.

184
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,400
No.

185
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,000
I do love you.

186
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,300
Pat.

187
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,900
Pat.

188
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,800
Pat?

189
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,700
Pat! Pat?

190
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,200
Pat?

191
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,000
Thanks for coming
at this ungodly hour, Doc.

192
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,900
That's all
in a day's work.

193
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,800
I thought she was
having a heart attack.

194
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Not a bad way to go,
coronary thrombosis.

195
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,500
If you ask me, it's the
most merciful death of all.

196
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,400
Quick and easy.

197
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,600
But, no, she's fine.

198
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,500
The pain in her chest
is most likely caused

199
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,900
by an emotional
condition.

200
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,300
Are you aware of anything that
could disturb her emotionally?

201
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,200
Anything at all?

202
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,000
No. Nothing I can think of.

203
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,100
<i>When it comes to the
opposite sex, most men are selfish.</i>

204
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,300
Whereabouts
does she live, Harry?

205
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,200
Fairhaven.

206
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,100
<i>I'm no exception.</i>

207
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,800
She's got a little house with
a flower garden down there,

208
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,400
and a decent job in town,
selling wallpaper.

209
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,700
<i>I wanted Harry's girl.</i>

210
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,700
That's near your weekend cabin.

211
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,500
Yeah, not far.
That's right.

212
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,400
You know, if you come by one
weekend to see us at the cabin,

213
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,100
you should stop by
and say hello to Kay.

214
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,500
Hmm.

215
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,200
There's not much for
her to do out there.

216
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,300
When I'm not around, she's just
curled up with a book by the fireplace.

217
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,500
She's a reader,
you know.

218
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,800
Hmm.

219
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,100
Is she?

220
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,000
I want you to get to know
her, the way you know Pat.

221
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,000
Oh, but she won't
want to see me.

222
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,400
I assure you,
she'd love to see you.

223
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,500
She'll have nothing to do
with someone like me, Harry.

224
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,900
You know how
honest-to-goodness women

225
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,200
run kicking
and screaming,

226
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,500
when they see me coming.

227
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,300
Well, stick with me,
my friend.

228
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,400
I'll make a good man out of you yet.

229
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,900
<i>It was while Harry was away
on business that I visited her first.</i>

230
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
<i>As a friend.</i>

231
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,000
<i>Or a friend of a friend.</i>

232
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,200
These look wonderful.
Thank you.

233
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,900
Is this your father?

234
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,700
Yes, it is.

235
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,100
He died of cancer, the
day after Christmas, 1931.

236
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

237
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,000
He looks like a kind man.

238
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,800
He was a drunk, actually.

239
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,100
But he was kind,
at least to us kids.

240
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,800
Thank you.
You're welcome.

241
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,400
That's my late husband,
Ronald.

242
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,700
The men in my life don't
seem to live very long.

243
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,700
I'll warn Harry.

244
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Please do.

245
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,300
Ronnie and I moved here
right after we were married.

246
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,500
But he went missing right
at the beginning of the war.

247
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,600
The Navy declared
him officially dead.

248
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,500
February of '47.

249
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,600
It's funny

250
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,900
how he kept me hoping.

251
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
His body was
never found.

252
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,200
I'm sorry.

253
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,300
I only had him for
about three years,

254
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,700
but I really don't
regret a moment.

255
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,300
You're lucky.

256
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,900
Why? Do you
regret anything?

257
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,300
Hmm.

258
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,900
Lots.

259
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,000
And much more to come.

260
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,300
But about two years ago,

261
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,800
I pulled
myself together.

262
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,300
And then with Harry's help.

263
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,600
My dear, sweet Harry.

264
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,200
Would you care
for a real drink?

265
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,900
Yes, please.
Okay.

266
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,400
I'll take a whiskey.
Straight up.

267
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,500
My mother came to live with
me at the beginning of the war.

268
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,000
And taught me to
laugh at everything.

269
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,700
A year ago, she died.

270
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,200
Thank you.

271
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,300
So here I am.
Gloomy, lonely Kay.

272
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,800
That's my life,
in a nutshell.

273
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,000
What about coming out
with me for a dinner?

274
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,800
We could go into town
or someplace nearby.

275
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,700
Come on. Little change
would do you good.

276
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,800
Well, I don't see why not.

277
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,500
Thank you.
- Sure.

278
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,800
You know, the trouble with Harry is

279
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,000
he's a man who depends
on emotions for happiness.

280
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,400
And he's married
to a woman

281
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,900
who maybe doesn't.

282
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,100
Is that what Harry says?

283
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,000
No, that's what I think.

284
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,600
Harry's just never had
anyone truly in love with him.

285
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,400
Until now.

286
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,200
Yes, until now.

287
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,200
You know,
he loves you very much.

288
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,700
Yes.

289
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,500
It must be difficult
to be apart.

290
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,900
I hate it.

291
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,400
You know, they say

292
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,500
a woman needs to be
loved, and that's true.

293
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,800
But it's not
the whole truth.

294
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,400
She also needs
somebody to love.

295
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,900
Sounds old-fashioned.

296
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,800
But it's true.

297
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,800
I'm sure it is.

298
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,300
I want to look after Harry,

299
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,200
just as he wants
to look after me.

300
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,900
You're his closest friend.
You know.

301
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,400
He's been hurt
and disillusioned.

302
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
And I want
to heal him.

303
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,100
Like a nurse.

304
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,100
Well, then.

305
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,900
Well, then.

306
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,800
Let's have some pie.

307
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,800
No, I'm fine,
thank you.

308
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,700
One pie. Two forks.

309
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,400
Do you think I'm wrong
to want to marry Harry?

310
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm not the judge
of your conscience.

311
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,200
I don't know you
that well.

312
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,600
I just want him
to be happy.

313
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,600
Well, I do, too.

314
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
And I can
make him happy.

315
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,600
Happier than he's been.

316
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
Then it's agreed.

317
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,100
Are you in love
with Harry?

318
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,900
I love him dearly.

319
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,900
Are you in love with him?

320
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,500
Yes.

321
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,100
<i>Did I sense
a breath of hesitation?</i>

322
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,100
<i>I thought I did.</i>

323
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,200
<i>I wanted to.</i>

324
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,400
Should I come in for
one last cup of coffee?

325
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,200
No. I'm pooped.

326
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,100
Okay.

327
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,900
Good night, then.

328
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,300
Good night.
Thanks a bunch.

329
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,300
<i>When are you and
Stephen getting married?</i>

330
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,300
<i>September the 3rd is
the date we've set.</i>

331
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
<i>Then I shall miss
the wedding.</i>

332
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,300
<i>I sail on
September the 3rd.</i>

333
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,200
<i>Something was
happening to me.</i>

334
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,400
<i>Something I had
never felt before.</i>

335
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,000
<i>The thought that those
colorless lips of Harry's</i>

336
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,200
<i>should ever be allowed
to press upon Kay's mouth</i>

337
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,300
<i>tortured me
day and night.</i>

338
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,600
<i>I love you.</i>

339
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,800
<i>Where was he now?</i>

340
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,100
<i>With his wife, like a
good husband should be?</i>

341
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,200
<i>Or with Kay?
In her home?</i>

342
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,800
<i>In her arms?</i>

343
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,400
<i>In her bed?</i>

344
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,700
<i>I had to find out.</i>

345
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,800
Pat, how are you?

346
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,000
<i>Fine, Rich.</i>

347
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,000
Yourself?

348
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,300
<i>Oh, couldn't be better.</i>

349
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,900
How is the old chap?

350
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,100
<i>Out of town.
On business. As usual.</i>

351
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,300
Oh, I didn't know that.

352
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,700
<i>Neither did he.
He plumb forgot.</i>

353
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,200
<i>I tell you, I don't
know where he'd be</i>

354
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,500
<i>if he didn't have me
to organize him.</i>

355
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,400
<i>Can you hear me, Rich?</i>

356
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,300
<i>Mmm-hmm. We've had
troubles with the line.</i>

357
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,000
<i>Rich? Yes. I hear
you fine. I, um...</i>

358
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
<i>Well, I suppose
I'm just a little tired.</i>

359
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,000
You sound as though
you need a vacation.

360
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,900
Maybe a quiet
weekend at your cabin.

361
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,900
<i>Anytime.</i>

362
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,500
You know your room
is always ready.

363
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,900
Well, thank you.
Thank you so much, Pat.

364
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,800
And, well, good night.

365
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,300
<i>Good night, dear.</i>

366
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,900
<i>Pat Allen could never imagine
that her husband would lie to her.</i>

367
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,400
<i>So much for
women's intuition.</i>

368
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,400
<i>I never believed much in it.</i>

369
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,400
<i>I believe even less now.</i>

370
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,000
How far are you going?

371
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,500
Couple of miles
down the road.

372
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,900
Thanks for stopping, pal.

373
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,400
Mind if I turn up
the heat a little?

374
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,300
It's bitter out there.

375
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,900
Alvin's my name.
Alvin Walters.

376
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,600
Nice meeting you, Alvin.

377
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,700
Care for a smoke?

378
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,100
No, thank you.

379
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,100
You're out late.

380
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:05,000
I was with my sister.
My oldest. You?

381
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,200
Just visiting a friend.

382
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,000
Whereabouts does
your sister live?

383
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,700
Ferndale.

384
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,900
She died tonight.

385
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,900
I'm sorry to hear that.

386
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,400
Very sorry.

387
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,300
Frankly, pal,
I was happy to see her go.

388
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,100
She was barely hanging on
for the last seven months.

389
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,800
We all gotta go sometime.

390
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,000
It's not dying that counts,
it's how you die.

391
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,100
And she died
bad and slow.

392
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,400
Both my parents
died in my youth,

393
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,900
so I'm no stranger
to death.

394
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,800
The last two days
were real bad.

395
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,900
Then the poison just burst right
into the walls of her stomach,

396
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
and she was gone.

397
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,800
"A blessed release," she
called it, and that's the truth.

398
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,000
It was a blessed release.

399
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,500
Just ended.

400
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,500
She's at peace now, Mildred.

401
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,300
That's all that matters.

402
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,300
She's happy.

403
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,400
<i>And so,</i>

404
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,700
<i>with the innocent touch
of his wife's hand,</i>

405
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,100
<i>Harry's mind was made up.</i>

406
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,100
<i>He would have to kill her.</i>

407
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,000
<i>"A blessed release."</i>

408
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
<i>It was the only logical way for
him to save Pat from suffering.</i>

409
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,700
<i>And he would
never doubt it again.</i>

410
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,700
<i>Once the emotions involved in taking
a decision to murder have subsided,</i>

411
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,300
<i>the greater emotion involved
in the crime lies ahead.</i>

412
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,700
<i>Between plan
and final action,</i>

413
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,700
<i>there's a wide gap.</i>

414
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,700
You know, you've gotta be
careful with Altrapeine.

415
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
That stuff can
be dangerous.

416
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,500
Yes, I know.

417
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,300
I keep it hidden away
tightly in my darkroom.

418
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,400
If you got kids around...

419
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,800
No.

420
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,200
I don't have any children.
Thank you.

421
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,500
I have to ask you
to sign for it.

422
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,200
Of course.

423
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,900
Right here at the "x".
If you don't mind.

424
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,900
Alvin's my name.
Alvin Walters.

425
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,200
So, what kind you got?

426
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,600
Huh?

427
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,300
Camera.

428
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,900
Uh...

429
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,700
All kinds.

430
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,300
Sir?

431
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,100
You do need to pay.

432
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,400
Uh, pardon me.

433
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,400
How was your trip, darling?

434
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,100
Nothing unusual.

435
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,300
You're still in your coat.
Are you cold?

436
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,100
I just wanted
to see you first

437
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,700
before I settled in
for the night.

438
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,800
I missed you, too.

439
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,400
I think we should go to
the cabin this weekend.

440
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,900
Spend some time alone.

441
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,700
Harry, we can't. What about
our plans with the Arnoffs?

442
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,800
Cancel them.

443
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,800
I want to be
alone with you.

444
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,800
Okay.

445
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,100
I might go up
a little early, then.

446
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,300
Okay.

447
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,900
I'll go get
ready for bed.

448
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,800
Good night.

449
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,800
Good night.
I love you.

450
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,400
<i>On Friday afternoon,
the 7th of October,</i>

451
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,900
<i>I took the rest
of the day off</i>

452
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,700
<i>and drove north
to the Allen cabin.</i>

453
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,900
<i>I had visited Kay
quite a few times by then.</i>

454
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,500
<i>But today I knew
Harry would be up there.</i>

455
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,100
<i>I was restless.</i>

456
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,200
<i>I needed to know how much time
I had before Harry left Pat.</i>

457
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,600
<i>Before I lost Kay forever.</i>

458
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,300
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

459
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,000
<i>John O'Brien.</i>

460
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,800
<i>O'Brien was part of
Harry and Pat's group.</i>

461
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,000
<i>An unpublished fiction writer
of some talent.</i>

462
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,900
<i>And to his credit, the only one
among us who actually fought the Huns.</i>

463
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,000
<i>He lived alone nearby and
traveled every so often to town</i>

464
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,700
<i>for drinks and inspiration.</i>

465
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,200
Richard?

466
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,500
Ah!

467
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,600
John.

468
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,400
Yes, I was just popping in
on Pat and Harry

469
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,200
for a breath of
fresh country air.

470
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,900
"The Assyrian came down
like a wolf on the fold."

471
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,900
Yes.

472
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,800
Come in this way.

473
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,700
Thanks.

474
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,300
How are you, Richard?
Yes, very good. Thank you.

475
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,100
Hello, Pat.

476
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,000
Got a bed for
an old friend?

477
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,400
Of course
I have, Rich.

478
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,700
You know that,
or you wouldn't be here.

479
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,100
God, it's a lovely evening.

480
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,900
Isn't it?
Absolutely gorgeous.

481
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,600
Should be fine tomorrow, too,
judging by the sunset.

482
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,200
I should buy
a house in the country.

483
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,700
You really should.

484
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Yes.

485
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,100
Maybe I will one day.

486
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,400
Would you like
a cup of coffee?

487
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,300
No, thanks.

488
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,600
I can put some on.

489
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,100
Please. Don't make
it especially for me.

490
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,000
I could do with a cup.

491
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,900
And some cookies,
if you got them, Pat.

492
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,200
Maybe Richard would prefer
a whiskey and soda

493
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,400
to warm him up
after the drive.

494
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,800
I expect Pat could
provide it, Rich.

495
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,600
I think just a cup of
coffee will do, thanks.

496
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,700
Sure.

497
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,100
Maybe I should go upstairs,
and see if I can freshen up.

498
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,800
It seems I forgot
my weekend bag.

499
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,200
I'm sorry.

500
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,600
I'll survive.

501
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,600
Well...
Now you know, don't you?

502
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,800
Know what?

503
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,400
How things stand
between Pat and me.

504
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,000
Yes. Yes, I guess I do.

505
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,500
At least I know how
things appear to stand.

506
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,300
But appearance
is not everything.

507
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,200
I saw you kissing her
if that's what you mean.

508
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,600
That's exactly
what I mean.

509
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,500
Yes, well,
it's none of my business.

510
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,200
I'm not married to Pat, and I
have no need to cause trouble.

511
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,000
Pat's not the first woman
to flirt a little

512
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,100
when her husband's
out of the house.

513
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,300
It's not a flirtation.

514
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,400
As far as I'm concerned,

515
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,800
I've seen nothing.

516
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,100
The fire can play
strange tricks.

517
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,600
It's not for me
to pass on stories

518
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,300
that could be based
on a vivid imagination.

519
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,700
I'm very much
in love with John.

520
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,600
And he's in love with me.

521
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,200
That's the way it is.

522
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,600
So.

523
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,600
Divorce?

524
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,600
No.

525
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,400
No divorce.

526
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,000
Not ever?

527
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,000
I made a bargain with Harry,
and I'll keep it.

528
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,600
In sickness
and in health.

529
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,900
If I thought he didn't
need me so much...

530
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,800
But I'm all he's got
to hang on to, you know?

531
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,800
He has no one.

532
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,900
I'm very fond
of Harry.

533
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,600
And I can't stand the thought of
what he might do if I left him.

534
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,200
Do you think he might
commit suicide?

535
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,200
Perhaps not
so much that.

536
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,800
He may start
drinking. Maybe.

537
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,300
And his clothes
would all go to pot.

538
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,900
He'd be lonely.

539
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,600
He'd get caught up
with some floozy

540
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,700
who would drag him down and
take all his money with her.

541
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,000
What do you think, John?

542
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,500
I guess
Pat knows him best.

543
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,500
Poor guy hasn't had much fun
out of life, that's for sure.

544
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,600
Do you want to
know my thoughts?

545
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,800
Please.

546
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,000
He would be lost
without you, Pat.

547
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,400
I certainly think he might try
to kill the pain in some way.

548
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,200
Drinking, maybe.

549
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Too much at first.

550
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,200
No, thank you.

551
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,300
And the business.

552
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,800
I can't stand to think what
that humiliation would do to him.

553
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,800
And think of
yourself, Pat.

554
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,400
I'm not at all certain
that one can build happiness

555
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,900
upon the unhappiness
of someone else.

556
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,800
Some could.

557
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,600
But not someone with
your burden of conscience.

558
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,800
You're too good.

559
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,600
Thanks for being
so honest.

560
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,600
Don't you think, Rich,
he might marry again?

561
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,500
With some nice
woman or other.

562
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,400
No, I don't.

563
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,700
I don't think Harry would
ever fall in love again.

564
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,100
Pat is his entire world.

565
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,700
And don't forget I've
known him since childhood.

566
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,300
<i>Harry arrived
late that evening,</i>

567
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,500
<i>not long after
O'Brien had left.</i>

568
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,300
<i>He was disappointed
to learn I was there.</i>

569
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,900
<i>I didn't know
why at the time.</i>

570
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,400
<i>I didn't know of
his plans for Pat,</i>

571
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,900
<i>and that he needed
to be alone with her.</i>

572
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,500
I'll put the water on.

573
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,000
<i>I didn't know there was
a murderer in the house.</i>

574
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,200
Good evening, Rich.

575
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,500
Good to see you, Harry.

576
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,200
Can you believe
this cold weather?

577
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,300
Yeah, I got it.

578
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,500
Just what I need.

579
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,000
Pharmaceuticals.

580
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,300
That's the future.

581
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,000
I could use a good stock tip
if you have one, Harry.

582
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,700
What I could use
is a drink.

583
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,000
Harry!

584
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,900
He just went to
sleep and died.

585
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,900
Oh, Pat.

586
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,700
Harry.

587
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,900
Poor old Brutus.

588
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,000
His heart just stopped.

589
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,700
Here you go. Here you go.
Here you go. Shh, shh.

590
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,700
At least he didn't
have to suffer.

591
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,500
<i>It was a practice run.</i>

592
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,300
<i>And it confirmed everything
Harry was capable of.</i>

593
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:29,400
You'll have to come and stay with
Kay and me when we're married.

594
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,500
When are you
gonna tell Pat?

595
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,000
One of these days.

596
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,500
<i>Seeing her standing there,</i>

597
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,100
<i>I was suddenly
swept by a wave</i>

598
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,200
<i>of the most revolting
sentimentality.</i>

599
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,800
<i>I had never imagined
that I could be moved</i>

600
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,000
<i>to sacrifice
my own desires for Kay.</i>

601
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:55,300
<i>But that is what I
now proposed to do.</i>

602
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,800
<i>And it made me
feel happy.</i>

603
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:02,400
<i>I will come clean.</i>

604
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,600
<i>I knew enough to
set them all free.</i>

605
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:06,600
Pat?

606
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,400
Yes?

607
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,900
Pat...

608
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,200
What is it, Rich?
Please, tell me.

609
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,500
I could go to town
and buy a stone

610
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,400
with Brutus' name
on it, if you'd like.

611
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,200
Yes.

612
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,900
That would be nice.

613
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,200
What do you say, Harry?

614
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,100
Yeah, if you'd like.

615
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:43,400
<i>If only Harry had stayed
by the grave a minute longer,</i>

616
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,600
<i>so much might have been changed.</i>

617
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,000
<i>As it turned out,
it was the last time</i>

618
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,900
<i>such sentimentality
swept over me.</i>

619
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,900
What's the uproar about?
Are you on fire?

620
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,800
Come on, throw on some
clothes and get cracking.

621
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,400
We're going out
to celebrate.

622
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,000
Celebrate what,
for heaven's sake?

623
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,700
Well, we'll decide
that in the car.

624
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,700
Come on,
country mouse.

625
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,000
Change into something sleek,
and let's go.

626
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,600
Let no time be wasted.

627
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,400
This is no night for
a beautiful girl like you

628
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,700
to be in the house
all on her own.

629
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,500
But what's so special
about tonight?

630
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,100
Nothing special about tonight.
Come on, go.

631
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,700
Give me ten minutes?

632
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,100
Too long.
Seven minutes.

633
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,100
The horses are
getting cold outside.

634
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,600
Well, if the coachman wants
another drink, he can help himself.

635
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,300
The coachman will!

636
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,200
<i># Turn back the clock and
let's get together and rock</i>

637
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,000
<i># All night long</i>

638
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,100
<i># All night long</i>

639
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,600
<i># All night long</i>

640
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,600
Sir, there's only 20
minutes left in the picture.

641
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,800
We don't care.

642
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,500
We really don't.

643
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,700
<i># Now it don't matter
if you got to fight</i>

644
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:15,100
<i># The cops ain't coming out
till Sunday night</i>

645
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,000
<i># The joint is jumpin',
let the good times roll</i>

646
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,400
<i># And satisfy your soul</i>

647
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,700
<i># All night long</i>

648
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,200
<i># All night long</i>

649
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,200
<i># All night long</i>

650
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,200
<i># Rockin' all night long #</i>

651
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,900
Would you like to do
this again next week?

652
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,800
There'll be a swell new
picture at the Hollywood.

653
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,600
I don't think
Harry would mind.

654
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,800
Well...

655
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,700
I think he might be
a little bit jealous.

656
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,300
We can't be together
on the town like this.

657
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,800
He might be a bit hurt.

658
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,600
I'm not sure Harry has
a right to feel hurt.

659
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:10,800
What do you mean?

660
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,200
You know as well
as I do, Kay.

661
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,900
I suppose I do.

662
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,600
It's just hard for him
to find a way to leave her.

663
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,000
I wouldn't want to be
in Harry's shoes.

664
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:35,300
He's always trying to do
things with such perfection.

665
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,400
Well, I don't know
about that.

666
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,800
What I do know is you are.

667
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,100
Perfect, that is.

668
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,100
In my eyes.

669
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,300
You know, Kay,

670
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,500
it'll be hard to build
your happiness

671
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,900
upon the unhappiness
of somebody else.

672
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,200
Some people could.

673
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,700
But not people with your
burden of conscience.

674
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,100
Not this way.

675
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,100
Would you like to
come in for a nightcap?

676
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,300
Or a nightcap
to a nightcap?

677
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:31,200
Hmm.

678
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,700
A morning cap?

679
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,900
Well, just about.

680
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,300
I think even I
have my limits.

681
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,700
Okay. Good night.

682
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,600
Good night.

683
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,700
May I have that
cigarette you're smoking?

684
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,100
What's left of it.

685
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:01,700
Well, if you want.

686
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,900
Why?

687
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,200
Because it touched
your lips.

688
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,800
Good night.

689
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:36,000
<i>I'd heard a Texan say
it once to a pretty brunette</i>

690
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,500
<i>after the liberation
of Paris.</i>

691
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,500
<i>It was corny, of course.</i>

692
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,800
<i>But it worked.
And it was from the heart.</i>

693
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
<i>October 26th.</i>

694
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:58,900
<i>Harry Allen is as sane
and as cool as you and I.</i>

695
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,600
<i>He was simply convinced that
for Pat to fall asleep forever,</i>

696
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:06,000
<i>without fear,
and in the bloom of her life,</i>

697
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,400
<i>involved no hardship at all.</i>

698
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,400
<i>What was the alternative?</i>

699
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,900
<i>A life of suffering
and loneliness?</i>

700
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,400
<i>The humiliation of
an abandoned wife?</i>

701
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,600
<i>Harry loved Pat too much
to allow that to happen.</i>

702
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,200
You look especially
pretty this morning.

703
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:29,500
Thank you, darling.

704
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,900
Like one of those Sleep All
advertisements you see in the magazines.

705
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,600
"Drink a cup of Sleep All
and get eight hours of sleep

706
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,800
"and be a beauty like me."

707
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,800
I don't think they'd sell much
Sleep All if they hired me.

708
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,100
They'd sell plenty of
Sleep All with you, Pat.

709
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,600
You're prettier today
than you've ever been.

710
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:49,900
Thank you.

711
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,700
Let's feast this morning.

712
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,100
You know I shouldn't.

713
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,600
Eat, drink and be merry,
my dear.

714
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,200
I'll taste everything.
I promise, darling.

715
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,800
That's the paper.

716
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,300
Let me go down
and get it for you.

717
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,600
I feel like a queen!

718
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,000
Care for another
slice of toast?

719
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:26,900
Yes, please.

720
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,100
Not so much butter on it
this time, please.

721
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,300
Been having
indigestion again?

722
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,100
Not too bad.
Just the usual.

723
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,300
But you still take
your medicine?

724
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,600
Religiously, sir.
One spoon before bedtime.

725
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:51,200
Sometimes around lunch.
It depends.

726
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,400
That's good.

727
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,800
Have another sausage.

728
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,900
No, I shouldn't.

729
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,200
It took a long
time to prepare.

730
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,400
Honestly, Harry.

731
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,200
I don't know what we're gonna eat
the rest of the week for breakfast.

732
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,100
Harry?

733
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,900
Harry, have you seen
my medicine bottle?

734
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,400
What's going on in there?

735
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,300
I'm in the tub.

736
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:23,000
In the tub?
What on earth for?

737
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,600
I forgot to take
my bath this morning.

738
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,600
Guess I'm not
myself today.

739
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,200
I'll say.

740
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:33,200
Have you seen my
medicine bottle?

741
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,500
That last sausage
really did it.

742
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,600
What, the bottle?

743
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,400
Yes.

744
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,600
I have it here.

745
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,000
Why do you
have it in there?

746
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,100
Oh, my stomach's
bothering me.

747
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,100
Thought I'd steal a dose
from you, if you don't mind.

748
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,800
You poor thing.
What a messy day.

749
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,500
Uh...

750
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,100
Not much of a cook, am I?

751
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:01,200
Well, use the toothbrush mug,
not the rinsing cup.

752
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,800
The powder makes the glass
so hard to polish.

753
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,400
All right, will do.

754
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,100
Here you go.

755
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,600
Thanks.

756
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,700
You're not gonna
take it now?

757
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,900
Not quite yet.
I'm better.

758
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,600
I'll take a dose before
lunch, then another before bed.

759
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,100
That should repair
the damage.

760
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,800
I'm sorry.

761
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,300
It was a lovely breakfast.

762
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:46,200
A lovely gesture, darling.

763
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,700
Bye-bye, Harry.

764
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,400
Bye-bye, Pat.

765
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,000
Take care of yourself.

766
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,200
I will.

767
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,700
I'm sorry.

768
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,600
Don't be silly.

769
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,100
Harry.

770
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,700
Harry.

771
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,100
Harry, what do you think?

772
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,600
Excuse me
for a moment.

773
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:03,700
<i>Operator.</i>

774
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:07,600
I have been dialing
my home over and over.

775
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,700
And I get a strange tone.

776
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,800
We've had this
trouble before.

777
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,500
<i>What's the number
you're calling?</i>

778
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,000
42392.

779
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,600
<i>Hold the line.</i>

780
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:24,400
<i>I'm sorry, caller,
that line is out of order.</i>

781
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,600
Well, can't you fix it
right away? It's very...

782
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,600
<i>I'll report it to
the engineer's department.</i>

783
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,000
Daddy?

784
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:23,200
No, Charlie, put your
mommy on the phone.

785
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,600
<i>Grandpa, is that you?</i>

786
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,100
Call your mommy, Charlie.

787
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:31,000
When are you gonna come
and visit me, Grandpa?

788
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:32,600
I don't know, sweetie.

789
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,800
You go play.

790
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:41,900
Mrs. Walsh?

791
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,600
This is Harry Allen
from next door.

792
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:48,100
Listen, I wonder if you
wouldn't mind doing me a favor.

793
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,700
I've been trying to call my wife,
but the line's out of order.

794
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,300
<i>You want
me to go over and see if she's in?</i>

795
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,900
Yes. Yes, that's it.

796
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,800
<i>Hold on a moment.</i>

797
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,800
<i>Shut up! Just shut up!</i>

798
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,500
<i>Mr. Allen?</i>

799
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,000
<i>Mr. Allen?</i>

800
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,100
Yes?

801
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:25,600
<i>There's no answer
at the door.</i>

802
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,100
<i>I could write a note for you
if you want, and slip it under.</i>

803
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,100
Oh, that's so kind
of you, Mrs. Walsh.

804
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:49,400
Could you ask her
to call me?

805
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,500
<i>She could use my
phone if she wants.</i>

806
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,800
Of course.

807
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:58,800
Now, thank you,
Mrs. Walsh.

808
00:59:58,900 --> 00:59:59,800
<i>Goodbye.</i>

809
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,700
Is everything all right,
Mr. Allen?

810
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:20,700
Why shouldn't it be?

811
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:23,600
I thought you looked
a little pale, that's all.

812
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:25,100
Nonsense.

813
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:35,400
I'm sorry if I snapped
at you, Miss Jones.

814
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,400
I think I might
be getting a cold.

815
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,700
You know how
I hate to be sick.

816
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,400
Oh...

817
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,400
I'll give you some of
my cold pills, Mr. Allen.

818
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,700
I have some in my desk.
They're wonderful.

819
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:45,800
Don't bother.

820
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,800
You take a red one
in the morning,

821
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:51,400
a green one at lunchtime, and a
yellow one before you go to bed.

822
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,500
So it doesn't matter
when you start.

823
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,700
I don't think
I really need it.

824
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,000
It worked
for my sister.

825
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,100
And Milt in shipping.
He swears by them.

826
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,600
I just want you
to be well.

827
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:10,600
Otherwise, Mrs. Allen
might catch it.

828
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,800
Mr. Allen's office.

829
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,200
Yes, of course.

830
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,200
Speak of the devil.

831
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,000
Hello?

832
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,500
<i>Well, hello, Harry.
What's the matter?</i>

833
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:46,600
<i>Mrs. Walsh left a note on the
door, telling me to call you.</i>

834
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,100
Nothing, really.

835
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,000
<i>Oh, good.</i>

836
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,300
<i>I was worried.</i>

837
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:54,200
<i>It's not like you to
call during the day.</i>

838
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,000
The line was out of order.

839
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,400
Where are you
calling from?

840
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,500
<i>Mrs. Walsh's.</i>

841
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,800
<i>I was washing my hair when
she rang the bell before.</i>

842
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,600
<i>I'll call the phone
company from here.</i>

843
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:10,900
And how's your tummy?

844
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Better, thanks. I didn't
take anything for it.

845
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:15,600
I'll just take the usual
dose tonight before bed.

846
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,600
Oh...

847
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,500
There's this ghastly
dinner tonight

848
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,400
<i>with some local
manufacturers.</i>

849
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,800
I'll be late.
That's all I wanted to say.

850
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,800
<i>That's okay.</i>

851
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:33,400
<i>I'll go see that movie
at the Arabian.</i>

852
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,600
<i>It probably won't
be there much longer.</i>

853
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,600
<i>It's supposed to be good.</i>

854
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,000
Well, don't wait up for me.

855
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,700
Uh...

856
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,500
You know how
these things are.

857
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:47,400
I'll be in bed by 11:30,
as usual. I promise.

858
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,800
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

859
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,800
Harry, you must be frozen.

860
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,900
Come in.
I've got a fire going.

861
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,400
Would you like
a gin and tonic?

862
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,900
I'd rather have a whiskey
and soda, if you can spare it.

863
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:29,200
Of course I can
spare it, Harry.

864
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,900
It's yours, anyway.
You bought it.

865
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,900
Don't keep telling me that the
things I give you are mine, darling.

866
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,300
They're ours.

867
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:46,100
Well, then. Cheers.
And God bless.

868
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:48,600
God bless.

869
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,100
Amen.

870
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,600
If there is a God.

871
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,600
Don't you think
there might not be?

872
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,200
This cruel world.

873
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:04,900
Well, I like to think
there's a God.

874
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:11,000
Otherwise, how could we
explain all this hard rain

875
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,200
we've been having
all of a sudden?

876
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,600
Harry, are you
feeling all right?

877
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:20,200
Yes, thank you,
darling.

878
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,000
I feel wonderful.

879
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:28,000
I feel wonderful
when I'm with you.

880
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,300
You do look a bit off.

881
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,700
It's a little chill.
It's nothing.

882
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,400
I'm fine now.
Okay.

883
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:42,100
Well, you shouldn't have come
if you have a chill.

884
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:44,900
Not on a night like this.

885
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,700
And not be here with you?

886
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,600
No, thank you.

887
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:54,300
Best take a few aspirins
before you go to bed.

888
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,300
What's so funny?

889
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,700
Dear Kay,
I love you so much.

890
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:09,200
Nothing frightens me
when I'm with you.

891
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,700
Why don't I put on
some soup for you?

892
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:21,000
I'll help you.

893
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:22,900
There's nothing
you can do, really.

894
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,500
There isn't.
It's just soup.

895
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,400
It just needs
heating up.

896
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:28,400
Go and sit.

897
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,200
I'll miss you.

898
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:35,200
I'll be back
in a minute.

899
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,700
Go on, fix yourself another drink.

900
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,300
What's the matter, Kay?

901
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,500
You're very
thoughtful tonight.

902
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,500
Well, I have
good cause to be.

903
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:55,000
Then what's the matter?

904
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,200
For heaven's sake,
tell me.

905
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:01,500
Don't just sit there.

906
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,700
What's wrong?

907
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,600
Harry,

908
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,100
I don't want you to
get the wrong idea.

909
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,600
The wrong idea?

910
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,300
What wrong idea
could I possibly get?

911
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,600
Kay, what's wrong?

912
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,200
Harry,

913
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:40,500
there's no one who means
as much to me as you do.

914
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:44,100
The way you do.

915
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,900
And there never has
been since Ron died.

916
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:55,800
I just can't go through
with this thing, dearest.

917
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,600
I've given it
a lot of thought.

918
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:03,500
I don't think
it's fair to Pat.

919
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,600
I don't think
it's fair to you

920
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,100
or me.

921
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:12,200
Please, Kay,
don't do this.

922
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,600
Don't you see she would
always be between us?

923
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,700
Would she?

924
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,300
I doubt it.

925
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,300
I want to be happy.

926
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:37,100
With you.

927
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,500
Well, I, for one,
cannot take that chance.

928
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:50,000
I would have liked to have married
you, Harry. But not like this.

929
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:56,800
We can't build our happiness on
the unhappiness of someone else.

930
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:59,100
Some people could,

931
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,500
but not people with our
burden of conscience.

932
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,500
What other way is there?

933
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:12,200
Harry,

934
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:16,300
this is as hard for me
as it is for you.

935
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:19,000
Then don't let's make
a final decision tonight.

936
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,900
I won't feel any
different tomorrow.

937
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:45,400
Let's just see if we could get
through to the end of our lives

938
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,900
without further damage.

939
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:03,100
Thank you for
your past kindness.

940
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:06,000
And for tonight's dinner.

941
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:09,700
Harry, please don't
let it end like this.

942
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,000
Like what?

943
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,600
In bitterness.

944
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:17,100
Don't let it end
like that, either.

945
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:23,100
You think I'm a monster,
don't you?

946
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:33,400
I think you might have
let me know a bit earlier.

947
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:32,300
You did the right
thing, dear.

948
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
It was so quick.

949
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:01,600
May I...

950
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:08,500
May I have back the letters
I wrote to you, Kay?

951
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:21,700
Now?

952
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,600
It's easier for both of us

953
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:26,700
if the letters are
out of the way.

954
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:30,600
I can burn them.

955
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,600
I'd rather have them.

956
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:45,600
Harry,
they're all over the place.

957
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:50,300
Well, burn them
tomorrow morning, Kay.

958
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:56,200
The whole lot.

959
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,900
Without fail. Please.

960
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,500
Harry.

961
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:04,800
You...

962
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,300
Let's pretend
that I'm

963
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,200
just running down to the
store to get a bottle of gin.

964
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:22,100
Or, better yet,
that I was never here.

965
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:36,000
I've lost
everything tonight.

966
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:44,100
And I'd rather
not think about it.

967
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:04,200
I'll be in bed by 11:30,
as usual.

968
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:10,400
Here you go.

969
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,600
Are you aware you have only one
rear light working on this car, sir?

970
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:46,500
No, sir, I'm not aware.

971
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,300
Well, don't take
my word for it.

972
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,400
Why don't you step out of the
car, and check for yourself?

973
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,100
No, that's all right,
I believe you.

974
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:53,700
Can we just
do this quickly?

975
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,600
Step out
of the car, sir.

976
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,300
It's just a bad
connection.

977
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,000
Let me see your
driver's license.

978
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,700
Well, surely you're not going
to give me a summons for this?

979
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,000
You're not driving
without a license?

980
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:16,900
No. No.

981
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:19,900
Sure I... Here.

982
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:32,800
You in a hurry, sir?

983
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:34,400
No.

984
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,300
But I should
get back home.

985
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Well, you should've
thought of that

986
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:44,600
before you decided
to break the law, sir.

987
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:47,600
But I haven't
broken the law.

988
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:48,800
Everything's in order.

989
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:50,000
Good, thank you.

990
01:14:58,100 --> 01:14:59,300
You're free to go.

991
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,000
All right. Thank you.

992
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,300
You're home early.

993
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:20,700
Are you all right, Harry?

994
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:45,100
I must've dozed off.

995
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,500
Oh, dear, what's wrong?

996
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,100
I want you to know.

997
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:14,400
Know what?

998
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,100
How much I need you.

999
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,300
I know, darling.

1000
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:24,900
I've always known that.

1001
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,100
Funny, I could swear
this bottle was half empty.

1002
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,300
I think my mind is going.

1003
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,000
We must be getting older.

1004
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:08,700
Yes, we are.

1005
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,300
A bit too set in
our ways, aren't we?

1006
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:13,300
Yes.

1007
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:19,900
I love you, Pat.

1008
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,500
I love you, too.

1009
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:13,100
Harry?

1010
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:20,900
Why don't we take a trip
somewhere, just the two of us?

1011
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,700
I would like that.

1012
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:33,900
How was the picture?

1013
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:37,800
Fine.

1014
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,700
It was a good picture.

1015
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,800
<i>And so Harry and Pat
Allen resumed their lives together</i>

1016
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:26,800
<i>in that way couples do.</i>

1017
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,100
<i>Kay and I waited till the
next winter before coming out.</i>

1018
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,700
<i>I guess we want to be
kind in our own way.</i>

1019
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,900
<i>To let the pain
subside for Harry.</i>

1020
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,500
She's a doll.

1021
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,100
You're a lucky man.

1022
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,300
I suppose I am.

1023
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,700
You are.

1024
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,400
Couldn't happen
to a nicer fellow.

1025
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:14,500
Aw...

1026
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:15,600
Thank you, Pat.

1027
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:16,900
How serious is it?

1028
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:20,400
Oh, it's very serious.

1029
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:23,300
The most serious
I've ever been.

1030
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:26,800
There's something
really great between us.

1031
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:31,100
So, marriage?

1032
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:37,200
Yes, marriage.

1033
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,700
If she'll have me.

1034
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:44,800
Of course she'll
have you, Rich.

1035
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,300
How could she not?

1036
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,000
Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1037
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:57,000
A toast.

1038
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,500
To Richard and Kay.

1039
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:07,000
To us.

1040
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,800
To all of us.

1041
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,700
To life!

1042
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:30,300
<i>It was later that night
that Harry told me everything.</i>

1043
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,600
<i>It was a funny story,
in its way,</i>

1044
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:36,300
<i>about a man who tried
to poison his wife,</i>

1045
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,400
<i>and then found he would
be lost without her.</i>

1046
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:48,500
Three words.

1047
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:03,000
The drummer boy
is on a road.

1048
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:04,700
<i>And so we were married,</i>

1049
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,500
<i>Kay and I.</i>

1050
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,000
<i>We were meant
for each other.</i>

1051
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,500
<i>Harry was my best man.</i>

1052
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:20,800
<i>Did we build our happiness
upon the unhappiness of others?</i>

1053
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:23,700
<i>That's for you to judge.</i>

1054
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,000
Road. Road. Road.

1055
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,400
<i>Whoever in this
room knows what goes on</i>

1056
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,800
<i>in the mind of the person
who sleeps next to you...</i>

1057
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:38,300

<i>...please, raise your hand.</i>

1059
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
<i>I know you can't.
Not honestly.</i>

1060
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,400
Thank you.

1061
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:05,000

Good night, pal.

01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,800
Your turn. Take care. Good night.

<i>Harry Allen was the
most noble man I'd ever met.</i>

1065
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,900
<i>He never once talked
to me about his loss.</i>

1066
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,600
Come on, boy!

1067
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:48,900
<i>In fact, I now believe
it was a new beginning.</i>

1068
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:02,900
<i>It's funny, isn't it?</i>

1069
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:05,400
<i>What we do for love.</i>
