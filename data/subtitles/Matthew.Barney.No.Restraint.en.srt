0
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000


1
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,011
- Okay.
- Okay, good.

2
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:29,647
And three, two,

3
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:32,487
one; and action
with the harpoonist.

4
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:48,393
You're going to see a crust
starting to form pretty quickly.

5
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:51,301
The interior of the casting
is still soft,

6
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:55,398
so that the, um...
it pushes the, um...

7
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:59,775
it pushes through the crust,
and slides.

8
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:02,576
It starts to sheer
and slide away.

9
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:06,711
It starts behaving a little bit
like a glacier.

10
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,051
It drives the rest of the story.

11
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:11,852
The behavior of this...
of this casting

12
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,825
drives the rest of the story.

13
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,729
I was interested in the context

14
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,565
to describe these
petroleum jelly sculptures

15
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:24,831
that I had been making

16
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:29,399
and the history
of that material.

17
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,411
If you think about
where petroleum comes from,

18
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:35,175
I mean, it comes
from prehistoric fossil,

19
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,648
and the way that, um, you know,

20
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,150
the way that the whale
is probably

21
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:42,712
one of our closest connections
to prehistoric life.

22
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:45,656
I'm learning a hell of a lot
about this stuff.

23
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:46,818
I'll tell you that.

24
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,953
It's, like, more than I...
more than I need to know.

25
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:53,989
I just want to pour
this fucking Vaseline thing.

26
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,406
Hold on, there. Hold on.

27
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,737
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait.

28
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:02,741
- Mike. Mike.
- Everybody, wait.

29
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:03,742
Wait, Mike.

30
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,969
Okay, let's pull it.

31
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,572
That's great.

32
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,209
Excellent.

33
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,884
Big mold.

34
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,328
Yeah, out on the ship,

35
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,269
it's going to behave totally
differently, right? Cold air.

36
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,135
Oh, so you're going to break
it up right on the ship?

37
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,197
We are going to do this
whole procedure again

38
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:37,766
out on... out on...
at sea, yeah.

39
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,102
Come on, gather around.

40
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,373
This project
is by Matthew Barney

41
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:15,575
the artist who is working
in New York...

42
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:18,550
He is making a film
and sculpture

43
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:22,384
for a new project that will open
as a one-person show

44
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:26,882
next year at the 21st Century
Museum in Kanazawa

45
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:33,263
We are asking for your help.

46
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:37,633
Here is Matthew Barney.

47
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,569
Thank you very much.

48
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:41,595
Thank you much, Captain.

49
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,396
We're just starting
to assemble the mold here

50
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:13,098
so these are the first couple
of wall pieces going into place

51
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,334
that we're trying to capture
in this shot.

52
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:30,913
I am an employee
of the company.

53
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,515
I am a site foreman.

54
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,321
We've never had an experience
like this,

55
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,954
so honestly we're having
a hard time doing it.

56
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:52,376
...tie down to the front rail
to further remove the vibration.

57
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,846
It's been shown in drawings,
and we've talked about it,

58
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:58,248
but nobody really understood
what it entailed

59
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:04,245
to have 45,000 pounds of jelly
pumped into a big steel mold.

60
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,780
There's just a lot of things
that are different

61
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,918
than what we did in Brooklyn,
so we don't really know

62
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,622
if it's going to go as well
as it did in Brooklyn.

63
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:13,257
And it's kind of a
more of a sensitive situation

64
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,267
than it was in Brooklyn
'cause it's not our space.

65
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,859
It's their ship,

66
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,700
and the captain's already,
like, pissed off,

67
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,332
and if we screw it up
on this first day,

68
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:25,435
then they can just cancel
the rest of the thing.

69
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,469
I mean, I'm trying to stay calm,
although,

70
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,505
I know there is a lot of shit
that can go wrong.

71
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,417
The jelly is not coming
up right now, right?

72
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,943
Uh, no, they're raising
the pressure.

73
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,955
They're raising the
pressure in the tank.

74
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,685
Okay, everybody,

75
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,659
stand by, here we go.

76
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:42,888
Go ahead and let it go.

77
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,640
That's weird, man.

78
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,166
Okay, booming up, booming up.

79
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,645
- Booming up.
- Okay, Pete.

80
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,673
Very nice.

81
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,912
- Very nice.
- Oh, nice.

82
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,181
That's great.

83
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:15,482
Slow it down. Okay, good.

84
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:53,524
This is the 15th departure
of the Whaling Research team...

85
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:57,696
We are aiming
to catch 440 whales.

86
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:02,265
Without your effort,
we could never be successful

87
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:06,677
with our research on whales.

88
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:27,926
Every year the ship departs
from Shimonoseki

89
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:31,492
for researching
and hunting whales.

90
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:36,567
Each voyage lasts six months.

91
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,874
We take a break
for one to two months,

92
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,904
then we go on our next trip.

93
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,463
Well, the story really takes
place on the mother ship,

94
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,658
and, um, the larger idea
behind the piece

95
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,966
is to do with a guest and host
relationship

96
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:08,336
between my endeavor
of making a project here

97
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,070
and making an exhibition here.

98
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,238
So in that way, the
<i>Nisshin Maru</i> symbolizes Japan

99
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,510
in a certain way.

100
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,984
You know, part of the-the
concept of the...

101
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,987
of this coat and, um, some of
the other costuming is that,

102
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,716
that the characters--
the guest characters--

103
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:28,955
start out as land mammals and
slowly they become whales, so...

104
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,793
the stepping off of land

105
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,857
becomes kind of critical
in the story.

106
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:43,670
The story started to develop
into this, uh,

107
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,700
into kind of a love story,
really.

108
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:49,374
I felt like it would make sense
to bring Björk in

109
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:54,148
as a character, introduce her
into the story that way.

110
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:59,119
We've known each other for,
like, five years

111
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,716
and talked about a lot of stuff,

112
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:06,494
so such a big part of the
project is so intuitive.

113
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:10,730
We've gone to Japan together,
and...

114
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,170
probably found it was a place
where...

115
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:17,574
it was like a neutral place
that wasn't the States.

116
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,942
Because it's... can be tricky
for foreigners like me to be

117
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:23,745
in the States sometimes,
and it wasn't... Iceland.

118
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:27,617
It's tricky for foreigners to be

119
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:31,987
in Iceland, too, so it seemed
like sort of a neutral ground.

120
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:36,859
And-And I think maybe...
that's part of why, um...

121
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:42,994
when Kanazawa Museum asked
Matthew to do the project, um...

122
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,469
I can imagine he
maybe thinking,

123
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:48,871
"Maybe this is the one
that we do together."

124
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,572
I received a phone call

125
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,015
about the project
and Matthew Barney.

126
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,246
And she says that
Matthew Barney would be

127
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:05,451
a very lucrative,
prominent artist

128
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,425
like a Picasso.

129
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,792
I know Picasso,
but I didn't know

130
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,660
anything about Matthew Barney.

131
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:15,394
She also named Mrs. Björk.

132
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,493
But I didn't know the name.

133
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:20,972
She is a very famous singer.

134
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:24,965
I do not understand his project,

135
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:32,347
but, of course, not many people
can understand what is art.

136
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:36,480
If somebody gave
a popularity exam,

137
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,855
ordinary people like me follows.

138
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,349
Matthew always worked

139
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:12,949
in several-- what he called--
states of the same piece

140
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,424
so that there would be,

141
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,554
um, a photographic state
and a sculptural state

142
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,393
and a filmic state.

143
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,235
For this first shot,
let's, uh...

144
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,703
let's just focus on the spine.

145
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,834
If you ask him he would say
he's a sculptor,

146
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:34,403
and it just kind of grows and
becomes this other thing...

147
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:39,110
The only reason why he's doing
it is to serve his sculptures.

148
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,847
I can sort of relate to that.

149
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,685
I mean, I guess in a very
different way, I...

150
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:47,988
at the end of the day, I am
a musician and I end up, like,

151
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,358
doing photo shoots,
and I'm just standing there

152
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,263
thinking, "This is ridiculous.
Wh-What am I doing?"

153
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,199
And then it's-it's
all back to the...

154
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:58,465
it's basically
to serve the first...

155
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,631
you're doing it for
the music, you know?

156
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:04,200
As a group, we'd like to see
them all in the shot so...

157
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:08,145
looking down in the hole,
the object comes down...

158
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:13,912
...make it off through here.

159
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,285
Goes through...

160
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,820
And then have the, uh,
four other people...

161
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,822
...pulling the object
back into the room, yeah?

162
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:36,604
Matthew uses materials which
are not traditional materials

163
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:40,772
for a sculpture, if it's... if
it's being seen as sculpture,

164
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:44,840
which it certainly is,
because it's...

165
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,512
disgusting or liquid or greasy,

166
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,353
or all things which are
so natural, so, I think

167
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,984
it's rather about expanding

168
00:14:54,026 --> 00:15:01,592
these notions of materials than
limiting them to standards.

169
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:04,398
Good, pick up your speed,
very nice.

170
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,666
Here it comes.
Okay, here it comes.

171
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,400
All right.

172
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,668
- Now slow down again.
- Ten feet, B.

173
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,539
Slow down, slow down,
slow down...

174
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,518
In 1991,

175
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,155
Matthew had just come to New
York, he had graduated Yale.

176
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,665
As an undergraduate,
he had come to New York.

177
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,191
He had a studio on 14th Street.
I didn't know him.

178
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:43,402
Clarissa Dalrimple had been
directing a gallery, and, uh...

179
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,969
and a gallery at which Matthew
was about to have an exhibition,

180
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:51,540
maybe in two weeks, uh, and
Clarissa went into work one day

181
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,552
and the-the gallery
had been padlocked.

182
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,918
And I said,
"Oh, you poor darling!

183
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,821
This is terrible."

184
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,451
And she said, "Well it's..."--
typical Clarissa--

185
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:05,156
"It's not terrible for me,
but there was a young artist

186
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,392
"who was about to have a show
in two weeks.

187
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,334
"He's put his life saving into
fabricating his work,

188
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:14,863
"and he's being such a
gentleman, that I feel rotten.

189
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,137
"Would you go
and pay him a visit

190
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,441
and just kind of give him
some attention?"

191
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,912
Absolutely!

192
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:25,178
Matthew had installed,
in the basement

193
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:28,482
of this building,
this incline bench,

194
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,283
and he had covered it
in Vaseline.

195
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:34,258
And because the room was
refrigerated, it held its form.

196
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,317
And it was this

197
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,660
ghostly, beautiful,
amazing thing

198
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:42,394
that I had never seen
or ever thought of.

199
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:46,871
I mean, who would use Vaseline
as a material for a sculpture?

200
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,839
Then the editor of <i>Art Forum</i>,

201
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:52,708
she asked to see some images,
and she was go...

202
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,975
"Oh, Madonna, Madonna..."
and she was, like,

203
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,982
clearly beside herself with
these images, which again were

204
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,920
completely... they had never
been in the world before.

205
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:07,119
Matthew ended up on the cover
of the magazine.

206
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,592
He was probably
the first artist,

207
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,118
or one of the first artists,
who was kind of adopted

208
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,688
straight out of graduate school,
uh, and made a star.

209
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,294
Matthew had become

210
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,306
somewhat mythic by this
moment, and there were

211
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:25,868
instant crowds, instant
publicity, instant accolades.

212
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:29,369
Lot 327, Lot 327,
the Matthew Barney.

213
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,610
And $60,000 starts it.

214
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,242
$80,000 in a new place...

215
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:36,049
$90,000 to the telephone.

216
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,487
It turned a lot of people off,

217
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,219
as well as turned a lot of
people on, precisely because

218
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,955
Matthew was what was then a
relatively new phenomenon--

219
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:47,294
a guy whose career seemed
made before it even started.

220
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,324
And people wanted to find
all sorts of reasons for this,

221
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,496
that Matthew was really
just a fake

222
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,836
but good-looking,
he was marketable.

223
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:57,967
The fact that he was a model

224
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,068
was being used
against him there.

225
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:04,276
Well, if he was a model,
how serious could it be?

226
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:07,547
The whole apparatus
of the marketplace

227
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,749
masked what made
Matthew, um... special.

228
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,518
And that was he had
an imagination

229
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,186
that was pretty big;

230
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:18,492
uh, and that was unusual and a
little hard to get a hold of.

231
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,632
Everything began
with the <i>Drawing Restraint</i>.

232
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,497
That was the initial, uh...

233
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,435
that was the initial
artistic impulse.

234
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:03,100
The early images from Yale,
where he was

235
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,111
literally running up the ramp,
tethered,

236
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,443
making as many marks as he
could on the paper

237
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,677
before he was, like, literally
slammed back down.

238
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:15,915
It is completely
an artificial challenge

239
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,615
that he has set up for himself.

240
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,262
He exerts the maximal amount
of personal energy

241
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:27,663
to achieve the result
within this game

242
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:30,361
that he himself has structured.

243
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,638
Matthew's an athlete.

244
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,941
The sport of choice ended up
being football

245
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:44,311
and really informed
the early work.

246
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,613
Barney.

247
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,347
Again, they're trying to go.

248
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,787
He's got Corby Bernard,
touchdown!

249
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,657
Matt Barney,
what an excellent throw.

250
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,686
He is hot tonight and-and, boy,

251
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,824
are we going to see a
fantastic finish to this game

252
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,836
and some fantastic, uh, plays
through the air tonight.

253
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,704
I think Matthew does think
like a trained athlete,

254
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,765
and I think that has
enormous influence

255
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,835
on how... how the work
is structured.

256
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,981
He was also channeling
a certain kind of

257
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:30,119
1970s performance art
with an emphasis

258
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,790
on endurance and
physicality and process.

259
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:44,103
Because he was an athlete,
and because he is an artist,

260
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:47,111
it was somehow a combination
of the two activities.

261
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:51,411
And I think that he's very
involved, even now,

262
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,010
in the sports concept
of personal best,

263
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:58,453
where I think that he added
something extra

264
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,482
to the making of a drawing

265
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:05,895
by hindering the process
in-in some physical way.

266
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:10,925
So that the evidence you had of
this activity was the marks

267
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:14,905
on the paper, but it's the
activity that predominates.

268
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:39,923
This idea of placing hindrances,

269
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:44,493
of placing obstacles in the way
of achieving something

270
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:47,004
to achieve something
far greater

271
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:50,599
is the basis
of <i>Drawing Restraint.</i>

272
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,545
Cut.

273
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:01,813
All right, cut.

274
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:04,185
Okay, let's move, uh,
dolly over to here.

275
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:14,224
The scene comes from, um,

276
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,962
a traditional ceremony
that's held in Taiji,

277
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,525
a small whaling village,

278
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:24,304
where, um, a plate is served
with, um, shaved whale skin.

279
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,402
So that scene really
comes from that

280
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:31,144
and that we decided to make it
more like a piece of, uh, food.

281
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,880
So we made, in gelatin,
we made a slab of blubber

282
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,480
with black skin over
the top of it.

283
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,956
And we used squid ink
to make the gelatin black,

284
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:44,485
and, um, a milk
to make the gelatin white

285
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,724
and tried to keep the whole
thing edible.

286
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:50,758
The bamboo represents the net

287
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:54,499
that was used in-in early
coastal whaling.

288
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,649
I am nervous.

289
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:14,252
I feel like I'm
on a cooking show.

290
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:24,363
And then we want these guys,

291
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,735
we'll cue them
to all peel their arms.

292
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,740
All four at this table, okay?

293
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,742
Starto!

294
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:35,338
Our story is about the removal
of the arm from the field

295
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,975
and the oval of the,
the field is the body.

296
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:45,286
And the bar is an external
resistance that's self-imposed.

297
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:49,817
So, the symbol represents, uh,
restraint or resistance

298
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,761
that's imposed onto the body.

299
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,859
<i>Drawing Restraint 9</i> is sort of
about removing the resistance

300
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:59,234
from the body

301
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:04,265
and there being the potential
for a sensuality,

302
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,106
or an eroticism,
or, uh, something

303
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:10,740
that the project hasn't allowed
itself to have before.

304
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,945
So there's some sort
of suggestion

305
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,749
that removing the restraint
could enable something

306
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,221
emotionally positive,

307
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:24,718
but, um, but puts the body into
a state of atrophy somehow.

308
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,376
The harpooners
are actually firing

309
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:41,845
at what they think is a whale.

310
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,973
And they hit this.

311
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:49,213
It's basically shells of shrimp
that the whale can't digest.

312
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,983
At a certain point they vomited,

313
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:54,388
and these blocks of vomit
float around for years

314
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:56,223
and they calcify.

315
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,593
Okay, thank you, we're going
to move onto the next...

316
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,564
Thank everybody.

317
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,633
Stand by.

318
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:10,198
Yeah, we got your
signal back down.

319
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,372
And...

320
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:19,644
action!

321
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,810
Starto!

322
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,217
Slower. Slower.

323
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,347
Keep dropping, keep dropping,

324
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:26,084
keep dropping, all the
way to the floor.

325
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,367
You're amazingly calm.

326
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:49,505
Well, we got the shot, so...

327
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,933
- Like that.
- Okay.

328
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,130
- You know.
- So that what means this turn...

329
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:47,399
- Okay, I'll-I'll work it out.
- Right.

330
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,430
- Okay, so that goes up.
- Okay.

331
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:50,600
Yeah.

332
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:51,836
Yeah, that's nice.

333
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,207
- Okay.
- Okay.

334
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:54,472
- Here you go.
- Nice.

335
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:56,503
- See you in a bit.
- Okay.

336
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:01,709
Matthew's stories
are the sort of type

337
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:04,119
that you don't sort of go,

338
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:08,387
"Once upon a time,"
and the whole story comes out.

339
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:09,916
It's just so many layers.

340
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:14,659
I think it's to do also
with, um,

341
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:18,226
to drop the analytical mind,
you know,

342
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:23,764
and not insist on, uh,
an explanation.

343
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,199
And action.

344
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:53,568
Action.

345
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,072
Action!

346
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:58,872
- Starto!
- Starto!

347
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,403
Nice.

348
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,419
I love the coat.

349
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,430
Curtsy.

350
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,432
Nice.

351
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:24,492
Why's he laughing?

352
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,525
Keep going.

353
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,037
Yeah, she's going
through frame.

354
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:28,937
Okay... and cut.

355
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,372
Great. Thanks. Perfect.

356
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:32,069
That was great.

357
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,044
- Yeah? -Yeah,
the timing was perfect, yeah.

358
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,671
- Is there more stuff?
- No.

359
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,238
- No.
- Just that one.

360
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,079
- Sorry.
- Okay, it's okay.

361
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,961
I saw a video of a Norwegian
factory whale ship

362
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,090
from maybe the '50s
or something like that.

363
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,499
They had a games of some sort
where they were, you know,

364
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,799
sprinting and long jumping,

365
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,829
and, I mean, these guys
were probably out on...

366
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:05,104
on the water for, you know,
six, eight months

367
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:06,440
or something like that.

368
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:09,038
So, I suppose that gave me
the idea to,

369
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,911
to try to develop
some sort of a game

370
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,541
that-that our characters
could play.

371
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,779
That guy's having a good time.

372
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:20,756
What happens in this game is

373
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,556
a crudely made
garbage-bag whale

374
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:27,258
is dragged across the deck,
and, um,

375
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:30,426
the guys are-are throwing
these pieces of bamboo at it.

376
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:34,460
And cut.

377
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:35,473
Excellent.

378
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:36,769
Cut.

379
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,503
All right.

380
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:40,374
- Can you get a close-up
on the whale? -Yes.

381
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,208
- Standing by.
- I'm going to try to get a hit.

382
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,647
Can you guys, um,
pull the thing?

383
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:46,912
Slowly, and I'll throw it at it.

384
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,748
Okay.

385
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,180
Cut.

386
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,455
Let me try it again and see
if I can get one sticking up

387
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:58,928
that looks more like
the other one.

388
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,489
Okay.

389
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:07,096
The things that got me most
excited were these older

390
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,801
traditional rituals
and the form of whaling

391
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,400
that's really outdated.

392
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:15,935
I was interested in trying
to integrate some

393
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,541
of these traditional rituals
and ceremonies.

394
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:30,153
The world was dependent
on whale oil

395
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:32,686
as a main source of energy.

396
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:36,359
And when we figured out a way
to use fossil fuel,

397
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:39,734
the need to capture whales
sort of went away.

398
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:04,157
I wanted the mold to
metaphorically be a whale,

399
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,628
but, at the same time, wanted it

400
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:08,530
to have all the language
of a mold.

401
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:10,431
That's cool.

402
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:11,935
- And... rolling.
- Stand by.

403
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,403
Rolling!

404
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:16,305
Telescope out into an overhead.

405
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:19,242
- All the way up?
- Yeah.

406
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:22,610
We need, so we need to widen
as much as we can, right?

407
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,842
- Yeah, this is all the way wide.
- Okay.

408
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,649
Look at that.

409
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,258
There goes the crack.

410
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:38,228
Calving. Nice.

411
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:39,890
Ron, can we have
the flensers go in

412
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,899
and try to work that seam again,

413
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:45,096
to try to get it...
to try to get more to fall?

414
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:48,401
Okay, perfect, there we go.

415
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,498
Okay, stand by for
winches, Ron.

416
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,532
Stand by for winches.

417
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,952
Okay.

418
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:06,388
We're... Oh, yes.

419
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,948
Good one.

420
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,721
Looks good, right?

421
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,662
Did you catch that moment?

422
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:13,664
Yeah.

423
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,962
- That was gorgeous.
- Yeah, great.

424
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,025
That's looking great, Louis.

425
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,601
That's it?

426
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,800
Yeah.

427
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:24,830
That's it!

428
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:27,637
No fanfare?

429
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,977
No, like, "Whoo!"

430
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:35,952
These pieces are always
about landscape for me.

431
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:38,649
Also to do with making, um,

432
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,989
a deliberately entropic piece,

433
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,291
especially at the end of the
<i>Cremaster Cycle</i>, where I think

434
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:49,289
these chapters ended up being
a little more understood as,

435
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:51,768
you know, stories
that have a dramatic arc

436
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:55,136
with a resolve at the end.

437
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:58,665
And I think that for me,

438
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,644
when they're all put together,

439
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,943
it's, um...

440
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:06,949
it comes together
as a system that can't,

441
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,951
it can't overcome its condition.

442
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,081
It's trying to, and there are
moments in each chapter

443
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:15,854
where it seems like it succeeds,
but I think, um,

444
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:19,886
overall, it can't... it can't
overcome its condition.

445
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,559
And in that way,
these pieces, I think,

446
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:27,196
are important in-in...
admitting that.

447
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,832
I was interested in starting

448
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,038
what becomes a more
radical transformation

449
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,205
later in the story,

450
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,875
a kind of a metamorphosis
when the...

451
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:14,248
the two guests start
to become whale,

452
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:15,946
that that could begin
in the barber chair

453
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:19,787
with the removal
of his facial hair.

454
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,223
Who's the star of the show?

455
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,196
Don't ever forget who
the star of the show is.

456
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:41,575
I never will.

457
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:45,104
Have you called your parents
since you've been here?

458
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:48,346
No. Have you?

459
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:50,479
No, not lately.

460
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:52,079
Even as an eight-year-old,

461
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,784
as a ten-year-old,
as a 12-year-old,

462
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:56,385
he was totally committed
to whatever he did.

463
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,861
He was a really
active young guy.

464
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:01,023
He, uh, he liked sports.

465
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:03,932
I remember, uh,
Marsha made him

466
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:08,233
a Superman costume with a
cape and a big "S" on the chest,

467
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,035
and he just loved it.

468
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,905
He just wore it all the time.

469
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,879
And Matt gets up on one of
these, uh, storage sheds,

470
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:17,210
up on one the roof,

471
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:20,081
and... and flies off.

472
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,576
And, uh, and we all look,
and there he is in the air.

473
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:27,523
So I think he learned at that
point that he couldn't fly.

474
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:31,221
Yeah, this piece Matt gave us,

475
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:34,459
he did while he was still
at Yale.

476
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:38,731
And it's probably about
16 or 17 years old.

477
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,862
And this is
the original Vaseline

478
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,373
in the center of this.

479
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:46,308
And this, uh, this piece here,

480
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,938
which is now
a main part of his work,

481
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,972
originated from a wrestling mat.

482
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,847
That's where he,
that's where it started--

483
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:57,787
from his high school
experiences with wrestling.

484
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,813
He always wanted
to wrestle with the guys

485
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:02,325
that were bigger than him.

486
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,351
Does your mom worry
about you?

487
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,791
Um, probably.

488
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,064
Maybe the way that we tend

489
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:15,197
to throw caution to the wind

490
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,570
on some of these projects.

491
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:19,167
She's probably, um, she probably
thinks that at some point,

492
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,077
it's going to come back
and bite us in the tail.

493
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:28,107
At the very beginning
of our conversations, um,

494
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:30,586
I had said to him
at one point, and...

495
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:33,215
"What do you think you'll
be doing in five years?"

496
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:35,691
I mean, "Do you have
any big plans?"

497
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:39,594
And he said that he wanted

498
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,497
to do a work, and he said,

499
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,161
"Please don't think
I'm pretentious by calling it

500
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,400
a visual opera," but he wanted
it to have five acts.

501
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:51,636
Because he had
Barbara Gladstone behind him,

502
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:54,201
he had access to money, um,

503
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:56,372
and was able to make
productions that were

504
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:59,212
larger than
a lot of other artists.

505
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:18,460
He makes films, but they're
not standard movies.

506
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,527
They're not like most video art.

507
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,868
They relate to

508
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,498
sculptures and films
that he makes,

509
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:26,738
but not in a way
that's always clear.

510
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,729
A lot of people

511
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,960
reject it out of hand because
they just don't get it at first,

512
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,935
and they feel that it's
intentionally obscurantist,

513
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:55,166
and just
unnecessarily convoluted.

514
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:58,835
I remember the first time
I was there

515
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:02,209
and he was describing the
storyboard that he had laid out.

516
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:03,907
And he went through this
very elaborate process,

517
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,415
and this leads to this,

518
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,643
and then there were
these mustangs.

519
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:07,912
And there's this thing
in the middle of

520
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,544
the Bonneville Salt Flats

521
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:10,918
and then Norman Mailer.

522
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,013
And it sounded to me
like complete,

523
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:16,049
utter bullshit, I mean
absolute unbelievable nonsense.

524
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:19,688
And then, you know, what happens
is once you become

525
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,392
indoctrinated by this,

526
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,367
you realize that
it does make sense

527
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:25,391
in Matthew's world.

528
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:26,801
How do you feel, Matt?

529
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,668
This is the third day
you've been pretty much

530
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,936
dipped into Vaseline, now
you're into tubes today.

531
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,340
- Feeling pretty good.
- Yeah?

532
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,071
My sternum's a little sore.

533
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:35,078
Mm-hmm.

534
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:39,048
My patellas
are slightly abraded.

535
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:04,697
Matthew was working
with a vocabulary

536
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,369
that I had not seen before.

537
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:10,813
He was introducing
narrative and fantasy

538
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,248
in a very complex,
sophisticated way.

539
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:22,084
Even though each <i>Cremaster</i>
was different,

540
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,856
they had in common this story

541
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:27,329
of the descent of the testicle

542
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,356
and this system
that wanted to be free.

543
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:40,934
It finally, in the end,
had another metaphor to him

544
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:42,842
that very much related
to <i>Drawing Restraint</i>

545
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,041
and the core idea in Matthew.

546
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,413
And that is

547
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,851
that the creative process
itself

548
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,117
involves some strain and effort.

549
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:56,751
That idea of the <i>Cremaster</i>
itself being about

550
00:39:56,794 --> 00:40:00,321
this effort that
one makes, you know,

551
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:01,331
this breakdown that happens

552
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:03,890
and then this newer form
taking shape.

553
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:07,426
I think that's actually
very interesting

554
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:10,167
as a way of looking at
<i>Drawing Restraint, Cremaster</i>

555
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:11,902
and the whole creative process
in general.

556
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,549
There's a certain
cyclical aspect

557
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,348
that he continues to return to,

558
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:25,412
concerns that were there
in the very, very beginning,

559
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:29,984
that are about this notion
of growth through restraint

560
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,154
and I think that underlies
all of his projects.

561
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,501
Red kimonos.

562
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:47,533
Okay, good.

563
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:52,505
This is a place that
swallows up human scale

564
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,108
in the way that a lot of

565
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:56,517
the <i>Cremaster</i> stories
are set in

566
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:59,990
really dominating
architectural conditions.

567
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,185
I think that's useful
to the stories,

568
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:05,525
which are trying
to use landscape

569
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:08,964
as character or architecture
as character as much as,

570
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:11,900
you know, human-driven
characters as character.

571
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:18,238
Matthew wanted to plan
together the story

572
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:21,335
and the Awadori festival,
which is held

573
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:24,370
in South Japan every year.

574
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:26,610
That's good,
right in the center.

575
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,142
Four, four. Walking. More.

576
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:33,423
And around, Louis.

577
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:35,550
All right, Louis, like you
were doing something, okay?

578
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,322
- And then... 180, 180.
- Slightly reverse it.

579
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,699
The story...

580
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:54,870
starts in an oil refinery,

581
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,938
and they're about to bring
the oil to the ship

582
00:41:57,982 --> 00:41:59,540
so the ship can sail off

583
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:02,347
and hunt whales.

584
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:03,444
Okay, here comes the kids.

585
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:04,613
- Sorry.
- I told you to keep...

586
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:07,419
How do you combine
the Awadori rhythms

587
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,790
and an oil refinery?

588
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:12,057
We ended up writing

589
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:15,361
rhythms that are very,
very, very sub.

590
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:18,300
Um, they're almost, you almost
cannot hear them,

591
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:19,700
you can, like, more feel them.

592
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:23,969
Being the music nerds we are,

593
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:27,805
we're trying to write
sort of a sub-bass symphony.

594
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:10,186
I took some of the ideas from

595
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:13,280
one of the whaling
ceremonies in Taiji

596
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:16,088
where people's faces
are painted

597
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:19,960
in black and white and red.

598
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:22,966
Red, being the center,
symbolizes the

599
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,561
inner body or the muscle
tissue of the whale.

600
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,539
And the white is to do with
the layer of blubber,

601
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:31,370
and the black being the skin.

602
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:39,475
Do you feel... is it
pinching you anywhere?

603
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:40,949
No, not at all.

604
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:42,976
Okay.

605
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:49,883
Not the most practical
garment in the world.

606
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:51,827
Looks great.

607
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:54,956
I guess he's a spirit
of some sort.

608
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:57,263
Like somebody that would
probably work

609
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,826
downstairs in
the processing plant.

610
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,202
Some suggestion of belonging
to this place but...

611
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,868
but in the most part,
otherworldly character.

612
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:11,210
Check it out, Pete.

613
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:13,546
Scary.

614
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:14,949
Looks good, eh?

615
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:17,317
Yeah. That is really good, man.

616
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:18,821
It's going to be great.

617
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:21,188
Okay, rolling cameras.

618
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:33,030
Good one. Okay.

619
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:57,290
I've decided not to go too...

620
00:44:57,327 --> 00:44:59,295
like concept something,
whatever.

621
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:03,595
I-I... I've just been, like...
in one... in one song is vocals

622
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:06,262
and, you know,
another song is like-like, uh,

623
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:10,296
a rave track and-and the next
track is kind of like...

624
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,138
you know, a Noh singer.

625
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:15,509
And, you know,
I'm just trusting my gut.

626
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:29,415
My last album,
which was only vocal,

627
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,451
I was very strict with myself

628
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:33,122
and said this, I have to do
everything in vocals,

629
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,721
and no instruments allowed.

630
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:39,293
So it sort of had a discipline
before I even started.

631
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:42,134
So, on this one, I decided
not to have any of that

632
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:46,165
because I felt
I'd earned the freedom...

633
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:49,941
by five years of silence, uh...

634
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:54,440
it-it was time to kind of
just open the door.

635
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:04,419
It's so cute.

636
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:05,519
When I do my own music,

637
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:08,429
I obviously am very,
very, very...

638
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:12,629
deeply concerned
that the music I do,

639
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:14,728
that the root is from me,

640
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,434
the-the trunk is from me,
the branches are from me.

641
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:22,537
That is not, like, borrowed
from anywhere else.

642
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:26,538
Now that I am doing music
that's set in Japan,

643
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:29,177
and Matthew wants the music
to be based on...

644
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:33,315
original, ancient
Japanese music,

645
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:35,621
I kind of got a license to

646
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:38,628
go a lot further
in basing something

647
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:41,961
on something that musically
already exists

648
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:44,024
than I would ever do
for my own albums.

649
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:54,977
It's that... sort of fine
line between using something

650
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:57,309
and making it yours.

651
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,711
I've been doing a lot of-of...

652
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:08,691
just layers of my own voice,
um, kind of, sort of...

653
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:11,922
attempt to do, like,
an oceanic landscape.

654
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:15,398
Sort of... with my voice
since the whole movie happens

655
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:16,865
out on the ocean.

656
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:20,893
Instead of kind of having
me as a narrator.

657
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:37,043
You see the amas,

658
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:39,954
who are traditional women
Japanese divers,

659
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:43,255
coming in the story around the
time that the story departs

660
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:45,284
from land and goes
into the water.

661
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:48,591
So there'll be kind of a...

662
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:50,930
a passage that I'm imagining
will be really, um,

663
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:53,300
carried by music.

664
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:56,329
Everybody, everybody should
take several deep breaths

665
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,170
into their barrel
before they dive.

666
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,268
Hyperventilation.

667
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:03,905
Towards us, towards us.

668
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,005
I was really interested in, um,

669
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,142
in trying to capture
this sort of

670
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:11,621
hyperventilation that they do
and this, um, depressurizing.

671
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:14,215
When they come back up to the
surface, they dive deep enough

672
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:16,556
that they've developed
some way of

673
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:19,118
depressurizing their lungs when
they come to the surface.

674
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:21,323
It sounds like a whistle.

675
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:26,234
I'm hoping that by the time
we start sound design,

676
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,704
that I figure out what
that sounds like.

677
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,969
And then diving.

678
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,838
And action.

679
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,376
Cut.

680
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:18,252
We lost her
at the bottom of frame.

681
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,483
Can we, uh, Björk can we
have you, uh...

682
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:22,583
lean forward so we can focus?

683
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:26,062
Uh, uh, can I ask you one thing?

684
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:29,429
"The oranges were
a pleasant surprise,"

685
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:32,629
it doesn't sound like
a question to me.

686
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:37,129
- "Can you tell me..."
- Yeah, first you're saying...

687
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:39,699
that the bath you were offered
was very refreshing,

688
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:41,210
and then you say, "Can you
tell me about the oranges?

689
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:42,472
They were a
lovely surprise."

690
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:45,845
Yes, but it's not
a question, right?

691
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:51,950
The second line is, right, "Can
you tell me about the oranges?"

692
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:53,353
The way I've translated it,

693
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,858
it doesn't...
it's not like a question.

694
00:49:55,892 --> 00:50:00,727
It's that the oranges
are a pleasant surprise.

695
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:04,894
No, so should I end on
an up note, like a question?

696
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:07,665
- Tone up or-or down?
- Yes.

697
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:10,229
Uh, that would be fine,

698
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:13,606
particularly if... in Icelandic,
if that makes more sense.

699
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:16,271
I mean, I think it could
work either way.

700
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:19,214
Okay, here we go. We're...

701
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:21,308
rolling.

702
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:25,344
- Speed.
- Rolling sound.

703
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,653
And... action.

704
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:36,995
And cut. Excellent.

705
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,433
Okay, and you're going
to sit down next to me.

706
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:39,560
We're going to sit...

707
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:42,436
kind of uncomfortable pause,
then we're going to start

708
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:44,303
kind of looking towards
each other,

709
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:46,002
- but never making eye contact.
- Yeah.

710
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:48,577
And then I'm going to
get up and go to here.

711
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:50,204
- And that's the end of the shot.
- Okay.

712
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:55,207
The two guests
who arrive on the <i>Nisshin Maru</i>

713
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:57,186
work their way
through the hallways,

714
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,018
and eventually find their way
into this room.

715
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:05,757
This is a tearoom,
and is meant to be

716
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:07,457
in the bottom
of the <i>Nisshin Maru</i>.

717
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:10,830
We're good.

718
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:12,698
There's a tea master
who greets them,

719
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,796
and, um, a tea ceremony
takes place.

720
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:28,379
He brings the tea ceremony idea
to his project

721
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:32,912
and connects it
to his own ideas.

722
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:38,223
I sympathized with this idea,

723
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:42,960
and that's why I decided
to collaborate with him.

724
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:45,331
The ship is beautiful.

725
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:49,099
The path through
the-the fox hole is complex.

726
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:50,470
It surprised me.

727
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:52,771
Can you tell me more
about her name?

728
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,444
Okay, I'd like
to try that again.

729
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:03,047
I guess what was surprising
was the, uh...

730
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:05,782
how much like a... a game it is,

731
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:07,881
like a... like-like chess
or something.

732
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:10,449
It's how you hold the objects,

733
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:12,860
and with what finger,
and where you go,

734
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:14,591
and then you do this, and...

735
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,496
It's almost one of the tricks,

736
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:18,364
because, obviously,
the reason why you go...

737
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:21,063
you go have a tea ceremony
is to get

738
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:23,402
a-a vacation
from the busy world,

739
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,965
just to free
or clear your mind.

740
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:28,239
Af-After
the-the tea ceremony scene is

741
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:30,576
that the-the host leaves
and leaves the guests behind,

742
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:32,241
and they're...
they're together alone

743
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:34,978
for the first time,
and-and from that point, um,

744
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,484
they start to

745
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,919
break the formality

746
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:41,253
that-that the tea ceremony
established.

747
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:42,883
And from that point on,

748
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:44,985
the-the scene starts
to become more romantic.

749
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:48,258
The guests become romantic
with one another,

750
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:50,323
and, um, and intimate.

751
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:19,954
So why do they become
barnacles and squid heads?

752
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:26,967
What's interesting
about <i>Drawing Restraint 9</i>

753
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:30,096
and its storytelling
and its cycle of evolution--

754
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,573
Matthew asked us

755
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:34,133
to build this ultra-realistic
body reproductions that,

756
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:36,611
when they're being filmed,

757
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:39,979
as the skin is cut,
that will be parallel

758
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:42,381
to what's going
on top of the boat's surface,

759
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:43,977
cutting up the symbol,

760
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:48,980
is that instead of seeing, um,
graphic blood in human anatomy,

761
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,926
the skin parts, and it actually
becomes quite beautiful inside.

762
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:56,126
It's clean, undriven snow,
like whale blubber.

763
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,997
Nice and easy.

764
00:53:58,101 --> 00:54:01,070
That alone is almost
an-an arc in itself,

765
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:03,265
because you go
from the expected,

766
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:05,638
and you blend
into the unexpected.

767
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,538
Matthew's work tries
to expand the notion

768
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,551
of a traditional artist,

769
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:19,749
to question the body,
the function of the body, and

770
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:23,122
to use the body
in many more ways

771
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:26,651
than we are limiting it
traditionally.

772
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:30,825
What we're doing today is
we're-we're using body doubles

773
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:33,836
for myself and the-the woman
who plays opposite me,

774
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:35,963
and, um, in the story, we...
first we cut off

775
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:37,871
- each other's feet...
- Yeah.

776
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:40,740
And then we start, uh, cutting
the back of each others' legs.

777
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:43,075
Oh. So you try to eat
each other, yeah, yeah?

778
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,239
Eventually, yeah.

779
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,112
So you want it
to sit like this?

780
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:47,514
Nope, like that on the bottom.

781
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,609
Want it to sit like
this on the bottom?

782
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:50,984
Yeah, bottom of the foot up.

783
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:52,577
Oh, not the water heater...

784
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,722
When he decided that he wanted
to go to Yale and-and, uh,

785
00:54:57,761 --> 00:55:00,855
and was planning to go to Yale,
it was for premed,

786
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:03,491
and he wanted
to be a plastic surgeon,

787
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:06,934
and, uh, I had never thought,
you know, a doctor...

788
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:09,164
what kind of doctor
he was going to be.

789
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:10,331
It didn't...

790
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:13,274
But after I look back on it,
I could see, you know,

791
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,743
he wants to create.

792
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:19,238
He wants to create faces
and characters.

793
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:20,510
And I've always laughed

794
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:23,246
about him wanting to be
a plastic surgeon since,

795
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:26,346
because, uh, God, what a job
he would have done on people

796
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:28,823
if, uh, if they allowed him
to do it.

797
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:31,622
There'd be some strange people
walking around the street.

798
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:34,758
And action.

799
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:37,266
Sarah, come again.

800
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,494
Little higher, little higher.

801
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:42,903
There's your mark.

802
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:45,806
Holding.
Now, pulling.

803
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:49,278
Over, and... good.

804
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:51,712
Deep cut,
more behind the leg.

805
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:52,908
And there.

806
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:54,075
Little more.

807
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:55,675
Keep the cut deep.

808
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:58,950
Good. Keep going.

809
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:01,752
And back out, Sarah.

810
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:05,022
And up and out.

811
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:09,924
Great.

812
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,523
And cut.

813
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:13,399
The top horizontal.

814
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:17,872
And the tea guests
start cutting one another

815
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:20,933
in a very similar way
that the whales are cut.

816
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,069
The flesh is peeled away,

817
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:26,173
and the tissue is peeled away
until there are these trenches

818
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,343
that go all the way down
to the bone,

819
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:33,186
and eventually, the legs
are cut off completely.

820
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:54,862
Hi. Um, I just wanted
to welcome everybody

821
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:59,466
um, for the first screening
of <i>Drawing Restraint 9.</i>

822
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:02,706
Um, for a lot of us that
have worked on this film,

823
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:05,771
um, this is the first time
we've seen it as well,

824
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:10,047
so I'm happy that you're all
here to share our anxiety.

825
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:16,553
Honestly, I didn't understand

826
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:21,929
what the content
of the film was.

827
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:26,265
I was honestly surprised
our culture

828
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:31,763
could be portrayed in this way.

829
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:35,638
Pleasure.

830
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,245
Maybe that's shrimp?

831
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:45,482
I wonder what
the white thing is? Wax?

832
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:51,919
When you look closely
it looks gross.

833
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:59,794
He has put Japanese culture
into himself

834
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:05,069
and then represented it
through his own viewpoint.

835
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:07,406
Plus, he is adding his own
imagination to it.

836
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:12,403
Usually, when an American artist
uses Japanese culture

837
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:18,216
in their work,
it makes Japanese people cringe.

838
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:23,317
But his project doesn't give us
any of those feelings.

839
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:29,995
Hi.

840
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:33,059
I am very nervous today.

841
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:39,437
When you see the cutting up
of a whale,

842
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:42,774
it seems like a dark thing,
but in this case,

843
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:45,542
I was amazed
at how beautiful it was.

844
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:48,143
Ah.

845
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:50,477
How are you?

846
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:11,639
When I was in school,
and I just started

847
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:15,474
taking, uh, art classes, um...

848
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:17,376
I found that I was, um...

849
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:19,347
immediately trying
to find things

850
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:22,715
in my own, um... experience,

851
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:24,982
my own life that I could

852
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:27,114
turn into subject matter
and, um...

853
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:30,648
as I started to make things,

854
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:32,490
the process of making

855
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:34,496
started to become more
interesting to me

856
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:37,021
than the things that I was
eventually making.

857
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:43,497
This impulse to put myself
into a...

858
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:46,235
a... a physical condition

859
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:49,767
and to, um...
self-impose some sort

860
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,007
of restraint onto myself,

861
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:55,017
to challenge, um...

862
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:58,885
my ability to make a mark,

863
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:02,288
that eventually that idea,
or that physical condition

864
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:06,659
became an idea,
or became a story in a way.

865
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,566
Well, I grew up in a fairly, um,

866
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:15,298
isolated part of the country.

867
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,966
Boise, Idaho is a small city

868
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:20,065
in the northwest,
but I think, I think

869
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:22,976
I always felt growing up

870
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:27,745
like... there was
a long way to travel

871
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:29,911
to get to anywhere
that I really wanted to be.

872
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:34,684
I tend to start with a place

873
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:37,522
and, um, I bring to that place

874
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,653
my own language,

875
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:44,258
and taking my language and...

876
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,894
passing it through
another culture,

877
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:49,666
another place where, um,

878
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,765
mythologies that belong
to that place

879
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:55,904
can inform my language,
and, um...

880
01:01:55,945 --> 01:02:00,245
my own language becomes a guest
in this host body

881
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:04,481
and passes out the other side,
transformed.

882
01:02:05,481 --> 01:02:15,481
