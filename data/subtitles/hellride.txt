1
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,760
Safe keep the treasure for my boy.

2
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,200
I know you'll
keep your word, baby.

3
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,880
Safe keep the treasure
for my boy.

4
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,680
Keep safe the treasure
for my boy.

5
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,760
Fucking arrow.

6
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,720
Fucking arrow in the middle
of the fucking desert.

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,440
It's a nihilist's dream
come true.

8
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,600
It's a hell
of a place to die.

9
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,960
It's a hell of
a way to die.

10
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,800
It was goddamn perfect.

11
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,560
Shut up.

12
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,800
You want a swig of this whiskey
before I pull that arrow?

13
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,320
It's my destiny
to die right here

14
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,165
with a fucking arrow
sticking out of me.

15
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,120
With any luck, The Gent and
Comanche will die laughing.

16
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,000
Guess I'm gonna
live another day.

17
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,400
You got that right.

18
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,560
Aw, hell.

19
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,880
Fucker's gotta burn!

20
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,400
Come on, hey!
Hey!

21
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,800
Hey!

22
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,760
This might be the best
dust I've ever seen.

23
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,240
Pistol, I've been up to my ass
in dust plenty of times

24
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,920
but this kind of dust
is like a supreme kind of dust

25
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,960
that's been sent
from some other planet.

26
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,120
I just want to live in dust
now for the rest of my life.

27
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,320
Shut the fuck up!

28
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,480
Where's Comanche?

29
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,600
He's over there
taking a piss.

30
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,840
He doesn't want to get
any dust on his dick.

31
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,840
When we ride, move him
up to my left.

32
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,280
His name is Bix.

33
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,240
Forget Bix.

34
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,960
From now on you're
known as Comanche.

35
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,200
Woman:
"Had they really nailed

36
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,360
everyone responsible

37
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,440
for St. Louie's death?"

38
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,680
thought Pistolero.

39
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,000
Sorry.

40
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,880
My finger got stuck.

41
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,200
Next time share a little.

42
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,200
The Six-Six-Sixers.

43
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,680
They're back.

44
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,200
Something is rotten
in the state of Pistolero.

45
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,360
Take this one, motherfucker!

46
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,760
So I say we
cut off their heads,

47
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,240
we take 'em with us.

48
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,360
I say we just take a few
pinkies and call it a day.

49
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,840
Hows about we take their stash,
torch the trailer,

50
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,280
and get the fuck
out of here?

51
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,280
Why don't you put a smile
on your face,

52
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,480
let some sunshine in?

53
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,480
Life is good.

54
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,680
You're having
a bad hair day.

55
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,320
Ask Comanche to take
a little off the top.

56
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,440
Thanks for that.

57
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,720
Danke schön for
the secondhand smoke.

58
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,960
You got right
on the edge there,

59
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,840
closer than a hair
on a gnat's ass.

60
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,320
What, on the verge
of the brink?

61
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,080
Yeah.

62
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,440
Reading the situation
exactly right

63
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,520
is how come I'm the pres.

64
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,000
Hey, Comanch, listen,

65
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,560
Pistolero wanted me
to pass on

66
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,960
some important
information to you.

67
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,040
There's a job opening
at Supercuts,

68
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,800
about two and a half
miles up the road.

69
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,480
Those motherfuckers
had it coming.

70
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,360
Louie really was
a fucking saint.

71
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,680
Yeah.

72
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,640
I'm gonna keep cutting up
any motherfucker

73
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,400
that had anything
to do with him dying.

74
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,285
Trigger?

75
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,520
You named your bike
after a horse.

76
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,480
Exactly how old
is Trigger

77
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,640
in horse-bike years?

78
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,720
She's younger than
the woman I saw you with

79
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,280
in that bar in Reno
last week.

80
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,880
And I gotta tell you,
she's less horsey-looking too.

81
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,680
Pistolero wants you
on his left.

82
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,280
Speechless, eh?

83
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,845
The left, huh?

84
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,760
I never seen anybody
move up so fast before.

85
00:08:59,795 --> 00:09:02,640
I'll do my best
to remember that.

86
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,560
Anything you want to get
off your chest,

87
00:09:04,595 --> 00:09:06,080
anything you want
to talk about,

88
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,880
just think of us as a

89
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,640
support group.

90
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,200
Well, golly gee.

91
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,760
Thanks.

92
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,840
Let's get the fuck out of
this motherfucking hellhole!

93
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,440
# See see, rider #

94
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,200
# See what
you have done now #

95
00:09:53,235 --> 00:09:57,800
# See see, rider #

96
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:03,080
# See what
you have done now #

97
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,820
# You made me love you #

98
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,520
# Now your man has come #

99
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,360
# See see, rider #

100
00:10:11,395 --> 00:10:14,160
# Oh, I'm going #

101
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,580
# Away now, baby #

102
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,887
# And I won't be #

103
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:21,160
# Back no more, yeah #

104
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,120
# Oh, I'm goin' #

105
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,000
# Away now, baby #

106
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,120
# And I won't be #

107
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,000
# Back no more, yeah #

108
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,600
# And if I find me
a new girl #

109
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,400
# I won't be back at all. #

110
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,480
# Jenny Jenny Jenny #

111
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,640
# Won't you
come along with me? #

112
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,240
# Jenny Jenny Jenny #

113
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,280
# Won't you
come along with me? #

114
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,080
# Spinning spinning
spinning #

115
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,680
# Spinning like
a spinning top #

116
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,440
# Jenny Jenny Jenny #

117
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,880
# Spinning spinning
spinning #

118
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,720
# Spinning like
a spinning top... #

119
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,680
Bob The Bum.

120
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,800
We are

121
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,400
financially solvent.

122
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,640
Bob The Bum, it's good to be
financially solvent.

123
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,360
Hey, can we talk?

124
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,160
You want to talk?

125
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Yeah, it's kind of
important.

126
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,920
Now?

127
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,120
Yeah, this is kind of like
real fucking important.

128
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,880
Can't it wait a couple
of hours, you bum?

129
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,320
We'll talk in about
a month and a half.

130
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,520
# Spinning spinning #

131
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,160
# Spinning like
a spinning top... #

132
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,000
Woman's voice:
It was America's Bicentennial.

133
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,440
And for Johnny, St. Louie,
and Eddie Zero,

134
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,200
rebellion was
still in the air.

135
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,160
Sonny.

136
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,280
Cherokee's voice:
The three Victors had a little business

137
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,680
with The Deuce
and Billy Wings.

138
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,440
It was the beginning
of bad blood.

139
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,440
Woman:
Wanna fuck?

140
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,840
# Fast train... #

141
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,880
Trust me, after I
give you the bad news

142
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,400
you ain't gonna
want to fuck

143
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,480
ever again.

144
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,000
# What's at the heart #

145
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,440
Fuck me good one more time

146
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,760
before you never want
to fuck again.

147
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,800
I'm the messenger
of misery, baby.

148
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,880
# Of your engine's rage? #

149
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,360
Let's fuck first.

150
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,880
Then I'll deliver
my miserable message.

151
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,720
# To what smooth place #

152
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,960
# At the end of the line #

153
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,400
# With crackling fires #

154
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,200
# And quiet plains #

155
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,720
# Do the trees bend down #

156
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,040
# Fold their limbs
round you? #

157
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,360
# Welcome home,
faithful one... #

158
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,600
Let's fuck right here.

159
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,000
We never fucked right here
before.

160
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,560
Fuck me good
right here, baby.

161
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,000
If you don't fuck me
right now

162
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,480
you're going
straight to hell.

163
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,920
Baby, I'm already in hell.

164
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,280
Apparently I made
a reservation this morning.

165
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,120
Did you make
your reservation for two?

166
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,920
It's a very strict
dress code in hell.

167
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,720
You just can't
waltz into hell.

168
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,680
- There's a doorman outside...
- Baby...

169
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,160
I was built for hell.

170
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,320
I'm your devil babe.

171
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,280
I'm your very own
personal hellcat...

172
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,120
hellhole.

173
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,600
Mmm.

174
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,040
Baby, you're good.

175
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,200
Maybe you're bad.

176
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,400
Give me the info.

177
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,520
Can I ask you
something first?

178
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,200
Go ahead.

179
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,480
Just what kind of
fucking president are you?

180
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,840
Everybody wants
you assassinated.

181
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,680
Maybe you don't belong
in the presidential suite.

182
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
I'm better than the C.I.A.,

183
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,320
better than the internet,
better than the "Enquirer."

184
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,080
I'm better than all
of them put together.

185
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,600
I've gathered
more intelligence

186
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,360
than anyone
you've ever met.

187
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm better than
Deep Throat.

188
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,960
Give me the fucking info.

189
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,000
Okay.

190
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,800
The Six-Six-Sixers
are reforming

191
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,000
in the City of Angels.

192
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,600
The Deuce and Billy Wings
are back with a vengeance.

193
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,920
Always pay your debts
to Billy Wings.

194
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,920
Late last night a message
was sent to all hellraisers.

195
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,080
It said The Deuce would
like life a lot better

196
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,280
if he was living
in Victors territory.

197
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,240
Give me something new,
will you?

198
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,960
This whole
Deuce business

199
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,240
has something
to do with 1976,

200
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,080
something to do with
that Cherokee Kisum woman.

201
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,720
That's all I wanted to hear.

202
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,320
Now we fuck.

203
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,120
Get much out of Opium yet?

204
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,160
Yep. Flowing red in there,

205
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,120
Blood Alley.

206
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,640
What do you got so far?

207
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,480
How much can you live with?

208
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,080
I can stomach anything
I gotta stomach.

209
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,360
Speed and Machete,
they're tied to The Deuce.

210
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,160
Were. They're finito.

211
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,520
Goody Two-Shoes
just called in.

212
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,600
Speed and the Six-Six-Sixers,

213
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,160
they set up the St. Louie
crack buy... with Opium.

214
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,080
Six-Six-Sixers are
definitely coming at us.

215
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,920
Deuce and Billy Wings
are coming.

216
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,440
Meet me tomorrow in Tucson.

217
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,280
Dani's Inferno. 3:00 P.M.
You got that?

218
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:44,240
I got it.

219
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,880
How much did The Deuce pay you
to set up St. Louie?

220
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,040
Stand up.

221
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,840
I'm sorry.
Please.

222
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,520
Right from the start
I treated you like a son.

223
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,120
Oh, well. Family
isn't everything.

224
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,600
No.

225
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,680
Where's The Deuce, Doc?

226
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,760
And where's Pistolero?

227
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,200
I guess I'm just
a fuckup, Billy.

228
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,200
I guess you are.

229
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,160
I guess I won't be needing
your services anymore.

230
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,600
You're off the payroll,
Doc.

231
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,285
# Might have been a time #

232
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,840
# I needed your kiss
in the night #

233
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,040
# Might have been a time #

234
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,440
# The sound of your voice
made it right... #

235
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,480
- Hello, Gigi.
- Hey.

236
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,080
Tell Yvonne that the Victors are
gonna seize the V.I.P. table.

237
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,360
Bring over some beer.

238
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,680
If our beer don't kill you,

239
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,640
it'll sure make you piss
stronger.

240
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,880
I got the cowboy.

241
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,200
# Now you've gone and cut
a whole new deal #

242
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,360
# And it don't matter
how I feel #

243
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,080
# Hell's bells... #

244
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,440
Come on, bitch!

245
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,240
Hi, Gent.

246
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,240
How many of these horny little
devils you bang anyway?

247
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,480
Yvonne, you snuck up
on me, didn't you?

248
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,960
Gentlemen, this is Yvonne,
the future Mrs. Gent.

249
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,240
We won't be shopping for
furniture anytime soon.

250
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,880
What happened?

251
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,480
You introduced Gigi as the
future Mrs. Gent last month.

252
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,480
I forgot.

253
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,480
To the next Mrs. Gent.

254
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,400
Oh, and when you're done,

255
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,360
come to my office.

256
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,880
We're having a private party.

257
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,640
I'm fuckin' there!
Right now!

258
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,840
- These guys are animals.
- Why do we gotta wait?

259
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,040
You're out!

260
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,640
Pistolero kept his word.

261
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,960
He made a vow
to the three B's:

262
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,160
Bikes, Beer, and Booty.

263
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,560
We could be rich, man,
you know?

264
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,680
I'm talking about four B's:

265
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,920
Bikes, Beer, Booty,

266
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,320
and Big Bucks, man!

267
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,240
That's actually
fuckin' five B's.

268
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,720
There's a lot of dough
to be had out there.

269
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,760
The Deuce, the Six-Six-Sixers,

270
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,880
they're the fuckin' future.

271
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,640
Pistolero...

272
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,960
he needs to be ousted.

273
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,280
All I know

274
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,640
is I'd battle Satan
for Pistol.

275
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,640
A little fuckin' redundant,
don't you think?

276
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,960
You know what?
Fuck you.

277
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,040
Fuck me?

278
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,240
Fuck both you guys.
I'm headed in there right now

279
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,160
and fuckin' wrestle
with those bitches!

280
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,400
Hey!

281
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,840
Well, fuck it. If I have to
help him I have to help.

282
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,040
- Come on in.
- Oh, man!

283
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,520
Shit! Yeah.

284
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,280
Where's all them
oily pussies at?

285
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,720
The oily bird
gets the worm.

286
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,640
Meet me in Tucson
tomorrow at 6:00,

287
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,640
Dani's Inferno.

288
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,800
Ladies are not welcome
except on ladies' night.

289
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,920
We got a sit-down
with the Sixers.

290
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,800
Well, the fuckin' Sixers
ain't here.

291
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,400
This better not be one
long ride for nothing.

292
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,320
I gotta take a piss.

293
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,000
Where's your head?

294
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,680
The ladies room is closed
except for ladies' night.

295
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,440
Now you got a.38
pointed at your head.

296
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,920
You give me your colors,
you little pisser,

297
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,120
or there's gonna be one
unvictorious Victor.

298
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,200
What are you gonna do

299
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,840
with these eight other
little pissers when I don't?

300
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,200
I'm gonna wine 'em
and dine 'em.

301
00:28:17,235 --> 00:28:20,840
I'm gonna show them Paris.

302
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,720
You ought to see how
I'm gonna buy them off.

303
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,480
You know,

304
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,720
you have to accept
the fact that

305
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,080
the brotherhood of bikers
is bullshit.

306
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,880
The three B's:
Bikers, Brotherhood, Bullshit.

307
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,560
Do you ever do anything
but yack?

308
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,960
You half-witty piss-poor
shit-wit nitwit?

309
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,560
Take us to the fuckin' Sixers!

310
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,640
Sure thing, man.

311
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,520
Come on, no probleme.

312
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,880
How long have you
had that bike?

313
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,760
Since 1976.

314
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,600
Follow me if you can!

315
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,560
He's fucking with us, man.

316
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:13,160
Relax. I know this desert
like the back of my hand.

317
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,800
You just keep me
in sight.

318
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,440
This guy's a fucking clown.

319
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,360
Listen to me. We catch
that old motherfucker,

320
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,760
let's whack that Injun
motherfucker too.

321
00:30:27,795 --> 00:30:29,560
We don't need him no more.

322
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
I know whose side I'm on.
The Deuce.

323
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,040
Fuckin' copacetic by me.

324
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,360
I'm with you, man.
The Deuce, the Six-Six-Sixers,

325
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,720
Billy Wings!

326
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,560
Ladies shouldn't ride Indians
except on ladies' night!

327
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,280
Now put your balls on ice.

328
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,680
Let me get some info
out of him first,

329
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,400
before we send him to
the Happy Hunting Grounds.

330
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,160
I hope you got
insurance, old man.

331
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,360
Be cool, Sonny Boy.

332
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,240
Greetings
from Pistolero!

333
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,240
Nobody said nothing to me about
nobody pissing on my boots!

334
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,480
And I'm gonna tell
Johnny Pissed-Off

335
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,760
that I'm lots more
pissed off than him.

336
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,400
Comanche, meet Eddie Zero.

337
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,200
Now gimme a hand with this,

338
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,240
'cause I got things to go
and places to do. Come on.

339
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,000
# If you can dream #

340
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,720
# Dream of Maria #

341
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,400
# If you can love, #

342
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,960
# Then love Maria #

343
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,400
# She'll be the one #

344
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,480
# Who'll come to you #

345
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,640
# When sunset turns #

346
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,960
# To morning dew. #

347
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,040
Perfect.

348
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,960
Don't say that.

349
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,480
The day that it's perfect

350
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,880
is your last day on earth.

351
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,400
Hell is gonna get a hell of a
lot worse from this point on.

352
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,320
I think I finally found
Cherokee Kisum's boy.

353
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:09,120
The ones who killed Cherokee
Kisum killed St. Louie too.

354
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,520
The Gent.

355
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,080
That's me.

356
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,320
Pistolero would like to chat
with you and Comanche.

357
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,800
Well thanks for the latest
breaking news, Wolf Blitzer.

358
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,560
Dani's Inferno at 6:00.

359
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,640
You stay off
the main highways.

360
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,720
The Sixers are
cruising around.

361
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,200
Listen, it's
dangerous as hell out here.

362
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,400
How are you doing
weaponry-wise?

363
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,680
What, are you some kind of
bike-to-bike salesman?

364
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,680
I'm Eddie Zero, man.

365
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,600
I thought Eddie Zero got killed
in a big-rig crash in '86.

366
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,640
Yeah, I wish.

367
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,920
Tell Pistolero that I need
to have a chat with him

368
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,760
before the other chat

369
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,520
about this asshole habit of
him concealing shit from me.

370
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,920
Tell him your
fuckin' self, man.

371
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,240
# She got the love
and admiration #

372
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,200
# Of the Brotherhood Society #

373
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,160
# Of South Napa County,
yeah #

374
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,480
# She got the love
and admiration #

375
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,640
# Of the Brotherhood Society #

376
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,040
# Of South Napa County,
yeah... #

377
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,040
My pussy's on fire!

378
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,680
Your thoughtfulness
has given me the burning bush.

379
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,960
Glad to have the fire marshal
arrive on the scene.

380
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,600
Extinguish the fire,
Mr. Fire Chief.

381
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,960
How 'bout we get that
fire hose out?

382
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,360
Fire drill.
Mmm.

383
00:37:13,395 --> 00:37:14,880
Fireplug me.

384
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,920
First the fire chief takes
a ride into the desert.

385
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,280
Then I put out the fire.

386
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,280
What kind of
fire department is this?

387
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,640
Fire resistant.

388
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,040
Fire retardant
if you ask me.

389
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,760
You ain't the only
fire truck in town.

390
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,480
Maybe I got
fire insurance.

391
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,720
That kind of talk won't
get you anywhere with me.

392
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,480
I'm fireproof.

393
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,960
Did you bring the peyote?

394
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,080
I got some thinking to do.

395
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,480
Here's a little
reading material.

396
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,360
That's a lot of trees, baby.

397
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,120
666 pages.

398
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,640
Maybe when I get back,

399
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,000
your fire boy might do a little
professional fire eating.

400
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,160
Now you're talking,
Mr. Fire Boy.

401
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,040
I know you'll keep
your word, baby.

402
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,560
Safe keep the treasure

403
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:50,480
for my boy.

404
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,560
Portable Pistolero!

405
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,920
Your asshole behavior
looks good all written down.

406
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,600
It's existential
but sexy.

407
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,760
It's sexistential.

408
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,600
And it's not just
the peyote talking.

409
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,360
Let's get
the fireworks started.

410
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,680
I gotta be
moving on.

411
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,605
It's done... finito.

412
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,640
Do whatever you want
with it when I'm dead.

413
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,920
It's your annuity.

414
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,040
Now I want you
to drop those pants,

415
00:40:49,075 --> 00:40:51,120
sit back, relax
and watch my tongue

416
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,360
fight fire with fire.

417
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,280
Can we have a little
fireside chat

418
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,200
after you're done
tonguing me?

419
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,440
How's about we have
the little fireside chat

420
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,880
while I'm
tonguing you?

421
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,800
We'll kill two birds
with one tongue.

422
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,000
Are you 86-ing me?

423
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,120
You're not a pussy eater.

424
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,320
You never ate my pussy,
not once.

425
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,320
Why all of a sudden?

426
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,160
Nobody dumps me.

427
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,680
I'm the one that does
the 86-ing!

428
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,360
You fucking need to get
that Cherokee Kisum

429
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,280
out of your gut
once and for all!

430
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,200
Oh, Jesus!

431
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,560
Puta madre.

432
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,800
Bury me
near St. Louie

433
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,520
at the cactus flower.

434
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,040
Safe keep the treasure
for the boy.

435
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,280
Can I get you
anything, Deuce?

436
00:42:11,315 --> 00:42:13,320
No no.

437
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,760
# I'm going traveling #

438
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,280
# I'm a traveling man #

439
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,760
# Stay with me, baby #

440
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,120
# If you think
you can #

441
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,960
# Well, I don't know
where now #

442
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,760
# But I've got to go #

443
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,040
# I've got a need
inside me #

444
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,480
# That ever
tells me so #

445
00:42:46,515 --> 00:42:48,440
# I got to ride now #

446
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,040
# I'm a traveling man #

447
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,560
# I'm gonna
ride ride ride #

448
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,760
# Like I know I can #

449
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,960
# I'm gonna
ride ride ride #

450
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,920
# I'm a traveling man. #

451
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,280
You must be The Gent.

452
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,920
What tipped you off,

453
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,440
the outfit?

454
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,920
I'm known as Dani
around these parts.

455
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,000
I'm a friend
of Pistolero's.

456
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,680
Is that a fact?

457
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,800
Kind of a dangerous thing
to be nowadays, isn't it?

458
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,480
What's your pleasure,

459
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,760
booze wise?

460
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,320
What's your nationality?

461
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,800
Born in the U.S. of A.

462
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,560
I'm part Irish,

463
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,960
part Italian,
part Arapaho.

464
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,240
I'm an Irishian-hoe.

465
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,040
I must say,
God bless America.

466
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,680
And God damn it,
I'll have an American beer.

467
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,000
You got it.

468
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,120
What a country.

469
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,880
Thank you.

470
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,920
What should we drink to?
Christopher Columbus.

471
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,560
To Amerigo Vespucci.

472
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,440
Hey!

473
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,080
Why'd you fly the coop?

474
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,920
That wasn't part
of the fucking plan.

475
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,840
We were supposed to talk
to Pistolero together

476
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,840
after he got done
fucking.

477
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,920
It would be a whole lot
easier to explain

478
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,000
of you didn't have that gun
pointed at my face.

479
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,160
My life used to be
a bike-and-booty epic.

480
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,720
Because of you
and Pistolero

481
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,840
it's turned into a goddamn whopper
of a chopper opera.

482
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,320
Well, if you'd like,

483
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,760
I can turn your life
into an operetta.

484
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,000
Why'd you hit me
with that bottle?

485
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,440
How many of these
do you got?

486
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,360
Just one.

487
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,400
And I just
used it up.

488
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,920
Yes, you did, son.

489
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,600
Open a beer.

490
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,520
What do you got?

491
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,840
What do you want?

492
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,120
Around here

493
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,600
we drink
American beer.

494
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,960
American it is then.

495
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,400
I want to make a suggestion
where you can stick all your sticks.

496
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,760
Nobody's gonna
stop you.

497
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,480
What the fuck?

498
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,040
Implementing a plan
to save the day?

499
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,240
All you've been doing
is running around

500
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,880
collecting girls' phone numbers.
Come on, motherfucker!

501
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:40,000
Go easy.
Apache uprising.

502
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,960
A medicine woman
saved my life

503
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,880
after she
almost killed me.

504
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,160
- Beer?
- Yeah.

505
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,720
All right.

506
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,120
Which asshole
are you betting on?

507
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,000
I'm betting
you're a bigger asshole

508
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,320
than the two of them
put together.

509
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,680
I'll drink to that.

510
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,000
To the President
of Assholes.

511
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,640
It took me years
to figure out

512
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,760
if you were a good guy
or a bad guy.

513
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,280
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

514
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,120
It's how come
I'm the pres.

515
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,160
I'm gonna kill
the two of you

516
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,080
as soon as you
wear yourselves out

517
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,920
a little bit more.

518
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,560
Rope-a-dopes.

519
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,040
Hell, my life
used to be

520
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:46,320
one long biker party.

521
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,400
where all the pussy
was wide open

522
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,360
and the whiskey
was flowing.

523
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,720
Now it seems my life
has turned into

524
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,480
some kind
of a cycle symphony,

525
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:03,520
a symphony
in 666 movements,

526
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:07,880
a 666cc
cycle symphony

527
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,280
with no intermezzos...

528
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,040
Shut the fuck up!

529
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,760
What the hell were you
two assholes thinking?

530
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,800
Dani, can I be alone
with my two assholes?

531
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,640
No Victor
does any business

532
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,840
without getting
the go-ahead from me first.

533
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,120
You told us
to never ever bother you

534
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,400
when you were fucking.

535
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:42,000
I had everything covered.

536
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,360
Infiltrators, rats,

537
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,240
Benedict Arnolds
up the ass.

538
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,880
I had us covered.

539
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,200
You had you covered!

540
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,600
And God damn it,
I rue the day

541
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,840
that I became a Victor.

542
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,560
And I rue the day
that I brought Bix in.

543
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:02,040
You didn't bring Bix in.
He suckered you

544
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,480
into introducing him
to me.

545
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,360
Nobody likes
to be suckered.

546
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,760
Hey, go easy on him.

547
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:30,000
- I actually felt that one.
- Good.

548
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,920
We got some serious
hell-fighting to do

549
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,800
with Billy Wings.

550
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,920
You in or out?

551
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,080
Oh, I don't know.
I could go either way.

552
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,560
Which way
is it gonna be?

553
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,680
Eenie meenie
miney moe.

554
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,600
I'm in.

555
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,120
Good.

556
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,800
I'm holding two aces.

557
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,080
I'm holding two aces
and one Deuce.

558
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,120
I'm holding one Deuce
at the Inn 6

559
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,440
off route 66.

560
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,640
I had it covered.

561
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,520
I had it all
fucking covered.

562
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:07,280
I want you to meet me
at Inn 6, route 66,

563
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,000
tomorrow morning
at 6:00 A.M.

564
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,240
Think you can
remember that?

565
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,160
Are you gonna tell me
six more times?

566
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,320
A child of six
could remember that.

567
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:37,040
# We all want
to prepare you #

568
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:43,120
# The unbelievable
is going to happen #

569
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,880
# It will linger
in your mind #

570
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,160
# Forever #

571
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,560
# Let this carry you
wherever #

572
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,680
# Wherever #

573
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,560
# Triggering #

574
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,960
# The unconscious
power... #

575
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,400
Hey, what do those
white wings mean?

576
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,440
They're for licking
virgin pussy.

577
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,480
The red wings

578
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,240
are for licking
a bleeding pussy.

579
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,280
See that?

580
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,200
The blue-and-yellow wings

581
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,360
are for licking
a policewoman.

582
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,040
The blue-and-yellow-
on-brown wings...

583
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,360
they're for licking
a policewoman's asshole.

584
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,120
The green wings are for licking
a pussy with crabs.

585
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,920
The purple wings...

586
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,360
they're for licking
a dead pussy.

587
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,200
See that?

588
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,240
Pill-popping,
cunt-eating,

589
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,360
dope-smoking
motherfucker.

590
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,340
But you know,

591
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:52,280
in a good way.

592
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,000
Get out of here.

593
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,520
Come here.

594
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,320
Comanche, I want you
to meet Maria.

595
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,480
Hello.

596
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,800
Who the hell are you
and what the fuck is your story?

597
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:27,280
I'm just a guy
named Comanche,

598
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,840
a Victor

599
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,560
named Comanche.
That's my story.

600
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,720
Do you know anything
about a key?

601
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,280
No.
Tell me about it.

602
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:46,440
Do you know anything
about a safe-deposit box?

603
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,800
No.

604
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,080
Tell me about it.

605
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:01,240
Ever heard
of Cherokee Kisum?

606
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,360
I knew a Cherokee Indian
woman once.

607
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:12,960
The Deuce did too,
from way back.

608
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,880
When they
weren't busy

609
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,200
leading the sexual
revolution

610
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,240
they were busy
producing acid.

611
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,560
They made a fortune
on the L.S.D. market,

612
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,480
then coke.

613
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,640
The only problem was,

614
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,600
she was fucking over The Deuce
while she was fucking him.

615
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,880
And let me tell you
something...

616
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,880
she stashed away
one hell of a mint.

617
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,040
On July 4th, 1976,

618
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:42,840
she went up in flames.

619
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,080
She had a boy.

620
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:48,560
No one ever saw that boy
ever again.

621
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,360
How do I know for sure
that you're you?

622
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,000
Stand up.

623
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,760
Hi, Deuce.
How are you?

624
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,280
Hello, Johnny.

625
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,880
It's been
many a moon.

626
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,400
Mm-hmm.

627
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,760
Thank you
for the suite, Johnny.

628
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,680
You know,

629
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,000
I hope I'm not
being unreasonable,

630
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:49,240
but no mint on the pillow
again last night.

631
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,640
No pillow,
in fact.

632
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,040
You know, Johnny,

633
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,960
mint hoarding

634
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,360
is not good
for business.

635
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,280
The key to a good
business relationship is

636
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,400
everybody's happy.

637
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,600
I'm not happy,
Johnny.

638
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,480
That's a very
nice suit.

639
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:13,800
Yeah, well,
it used to be

640
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,480
before I was shanghaied
two nights ago.

641
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,640
I thought you got killed
by a big rig back in '86.

642
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,480
I ain't happy,
Johnny.

643
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,120
Well, who is, Deuce?

644
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,840
I mean,

645
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,760
tell me if it's
none of my business,

646
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,920
but I heard you did
a lot of traveling all these years.

647
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,840
That's very true.

648
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,880
Seeing America,
building an empire.

649
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,800
It was right around

650
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,440
the summer of '76,
I think,

651
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,120
when you kind of

652
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,320
86-ed yourself
from the Six-Six-Sixers.

653
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,600
You know, Johnny,

654
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,000
motorcycles are
big business,

655
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,920
big business.

656
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:08,280
I mean,
books, magazines,

657
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,040
clothing,
customizing shops...

658
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:14,480
so big that I finally
had to give up

659
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:18,160
riding bikes
so I could concentrate

660
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,360
on my motorcycle
business.

661
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,880
I traveled all over
the United States...

662
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,800
the Keystone State,

663
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,080
the Treasure State,
the Show-Me State,

664
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,640
setting up businesses.

665
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,400
I decided
to come back here

666
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,320
because...

667
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,320
because I had some
unfinished business.

668
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,080
Boy oh boy,
I don't know,

669
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,760
I tell you, l...

670
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,680
I don't know nothing

671
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,960
about the Keystone State,

672
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,200
the Treasure State
or the Show-Me State.

673
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,120
I don't know.

674
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,360
My business
has always been

675
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,280
just kind of minding
my own business.

676
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,040
So how is business?

677
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,240
It's business
as usual.

678
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,160
Good.

679
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,720
Then can we
get down to business?

680
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,080
Let's cut a deal.

681
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,000
How's this?

682
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,120
I get the Sixers
off your back

683
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,720
and off
The Gent's back

684
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,280
and you give me

685
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:21,000
whatever you feel
I'm entitled to

686
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,320
for services
rendered

687
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,680
and everybody's happy,

688
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:29,600
the three key points
of this deal being

689
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:33,360
that I get deposited
back in L.A.

690
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,600
with my entitlement,

691
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,520
and you and The Gent

692
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,440
get to die old men.

693
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,840
Those would be the three
key points of this deal.

694
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,760
I've had enough of you.

695
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:53,160
Cut out the double talk.

696
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,440
He doesn't know anything

697
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,600
about a safe-deposit box
or a key.

698
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,280
A key?

699
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:07,400
What-what-what key
are you talking about?

700
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,640
The key that Cherokee Kisum
had made.

701
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,800
Who's Cherokee Kisum?

702
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,520
Hmm?

703
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,880
Cherokee Kisum was
the young woman

704
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,400
you kept company with.

705
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,800
The young woman
who was set on fire

706
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,640
on July 4th, 1976.

707
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,480
Billy Wings:
Deuce, she's gotta burn.

708
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,520
Nothing, Johnny.

709
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:01,040
I'm sorry,
I don't have

710
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,960
any recollection
of any of this.

711
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,800
It was quite
a long time ago.

712
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:09,560
Can you recollect
setting St. Louie on fire

713
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,840
a couple of nights ago?

714
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,000
Huh.

715
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,560
Deuce, I swear

716
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,680
Pistolero never said
a fucking thing

717
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,240
about any
safe-deposit box!

718
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,720
No, Johnny.

719
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,640
No memory of it
at all.

720
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:30,160
But then I ain't
no Marcel Proust.

721
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:36,560
You got any proof
of all this?

722
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,040
Do I need
fucking proor?

723
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,960
Well, you must need
something

724
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,040
or I'd be dead already,
wouldn't I?

725
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,440
The only reason
you're not dead is

726
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,120
before I kill you
I wanted to ask Sonny Kisum

727
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,960
if he'd like to cut off your head
before I do it.

728
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,440
Hell, yes.

729
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,920
I've waited
all of these years

730
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,880
to kill him
with you.

731
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:50,520
I still got business
with Billy Wings.

732
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,720
Partners in crime,
right?

733
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:05,120
I had Eddie Zero
trying to track down

734
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,760
Sonny Kisum for years.

735
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,400
Maybe you would have
found Sonny Kisum

736
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,360
if your tracker wasn't
a 24-7 hash-head.

737
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,120
No.

738
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:18,840
No, in my opinion,
you don't find Sonny Kisum

739
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,240
until Sonny Kisum
wants to be found.

740
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,720
I was just about
to say that.

741
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:32,400
Cherokee Kisum

742
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:35,760
was one
wild-as-hell woman,

743
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,240
a good woman

744
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,200
but wild.

745
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,640
I gave her my word

746
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:52,920
if anything happened
to her

747
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,080
I'd safe keep the treasure
for her boy.

748
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:59,800
Is it being
kept safer

749
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,800
than the safekeeping
of Cherokee Kisum was?

750
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:06,600
She wasn't looking to me
for safekeeping.

751
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,720
I never knew what happened
the day she died

752
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,640
and couldn't find
anyone who did.

753
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:17,160
It was a 36-carat-

754
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,080
diamond-studded,

755
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,600
solid gold riddle.

756
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,640
Look, I'm an owl.

757
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,880
Get out of here.

758
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,040
In the basket.

759
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,280
Ain't that Pistolero
one malevolent motherfucker?

760
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,720
Follow me
to Pistolero

761
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,880
if you can
stomach it.

762
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,240
Well now,
the way I see it

763
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:21,440
I only got close to that treasure
once before

764
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,360
and I ain't gonna let
that motherfucker

765
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,360
fuck it up again
this time.

766
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,000
Let's ride.

767
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,280
Go home.

768
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,880
It'll all amount
to nothing.

769
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,240
Pistolero's coming here.

770
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:23,080
Don't fuck up.
I need him alive.

771
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,360
Hey, piker biker.

772
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,920
Purple wings.

773
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,480
Can you two stomach
which dead pussy

774
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,400
earned me
my purple wings?

775
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:25,720
Ain't nothing
you can do to me

776
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,240
I can't stomach.

777
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,600
You ain't seen
nothing yet.

778
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,360
Give Comanche the two keys
you're holding.

779
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,600
Let him safe keep 'em
for a while.

780
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,120
Give Comanche the two keys
you're holding.

781
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:02,240
Let him safe keep 'em
for a while, God damn it.

782
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:14,440
Take a peek at St. Louie.
See if he's resting in peace.

783
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,840
Look for
the cactus flower.

784
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,360
You know, you should
lighten up on yourself.

785
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:30,000
When you fuck with The Deuce
you're gonna get burned by The Deuce.

786
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:33,320
I met her before
she met The Deuce.

787
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,200
I first met her
in 1969

788
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,480
through Eddie Zero.

789
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,000
She was 16.
I was 14.

790
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:44,360
Think about that one.

791
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,680
Hey, you okay?

792
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:33,880
- Nada?
- Yes, sir.

793
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,560
- Did you bring my jacket?
- Mm-hmm. Everything okay?

794
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,800
Oh, yeah.

795
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:43,120
So how come
we'd never met before?

796
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,200
- I'm Eddie.
- I know, Eddie.

797
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:47,960
You ever get tired
of faking your own death?

798
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,960
You got a joint?

799
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,720
I sure do.

800
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,640
Baby.

801
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:58,240
Hey, Kemo Sabe,
just how much was

802
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,760
in that box for us
from the Cherokee woman?

803
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,280
Us?

804
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,760
Us, yeah, like you and me.
Us, yeah.

805
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,840
I knew it would
come to this... us.

806
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:10,240
Well, I don't want
nothing from it.

807
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:13,560
I'm only curious to know
how much is in there.

808
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,360
You're just curious,

809
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,280
but you don't want
nothing from it.

810
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:19,400
No, I don't.

811
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,880
It's none of our business
what's in the box.

812
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,800
So what you're
saying is

813
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,080
that the booty
in the box

814
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:31,560
that I've already said
that I don't want nothing from

815
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,200
is none
of my business?

816
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,880
Gent: So let me
get this straight...

817
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:59,720
the box and the booty
that's in it

818
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,920
which I've already said

819
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,320
that I don't want
nothing of

820
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,320
is none
of my business?

821
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,720
Butt out of the booty business,
in other words.

822
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,200
Well, you're being
downright unfriendly now.

823
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:14,800
Where's the cash
that Bob The Bum was holding

824
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:18,240
when he got
his throat slit?

825
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,400
Oh, well,
I'm holding on to that.

826
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:24,800
I'm keeping it safe

827
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,160
'cause that's
my destiny.

828
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,600
And maybe that's
none of your business.

829
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,800
I think it's my business
to have in my hand right there.

830
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:35,800
Listen, I don't want
to have to kill you.

831
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,720
I want you
to hand over

832
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:41,680
Bob The Bum's cash
right now.

833
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,760
Go ahead. Where do you want
to kill me, here?

834
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,920
You want to kill me
between the eyes?

835
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,400
Right between
the eyes, yeah.

836
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,320
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

837
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:34,800
Put it right between my fucking eyes.

838
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,880
Come on, go ahead.
You can do it.

839
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,920
Come on.

840
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:45,640
Eh...

841
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:48,480
I was counting on you
to do something

842
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,440
to stop this whole
fucking ridiculous thing.

843
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,360
What the hell
made you think

844
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,680
you could count
on me?

845
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:56,600
What got into your
fucking brain?

846
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,320
Because I love you.

847
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:03,840
Aw, hell.

848
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:16,280
You did good, Sonny.

849
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:21,400
I think I'm gonna
call you son from now on

850
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:25,360
'cause Sonny's eating up
way too much fucking time.

851
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,920
# Oh, see #

852
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:53,120
# See see, rider #

853
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,480
# I said, see #

854
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,680
# What you have
done now #

855
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:00,080
# Oh, see #

856
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,520
# See see, rider #

857
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,680
# I said, see #

858
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,040
# What you have
done now #

859
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,800
# Oh, you made me
love you #

860
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,920
# Now now now now
your man has gone #

861
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,800
# See see, rider #

862
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,880
- # Oh #
- # See see, rider #

863
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:21,000
# I'm going away now,
baby #

864
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,600
# And I won't be #

865
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,520
# Back no more, yeah #

866
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:28,120
# Oh, I'm going #

867
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:30,520
# Away now, baby #

868
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,760
# And I won't be #

869
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,080
# Back no more, yeah #

870
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:38,120
# If I find me
a good girl #

871
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:42,320
- # I won't be back at all #
- # See see, rider #

872
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,320
- # All right #
- # See see, rider. #

873
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,840
# Mama told you
not to play by the fire #

874
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:08,640
# And now you've gone
and wrapped yourself in barbed wire #

875
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:10,560
# Every time
I see a red light #

876
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:14,440
# You say go #

877
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:17,320
# Sun is burning
on a hot summer day #

878
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:20,080
# I'm in a hurry, honey,
clear the way #

879
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,920
# Daddy still ain't home #

880
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:25,480
# With the babies crying #

881
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,240
# Mama's cooking up
rice and beans #

882
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:29,680
# While we're #

883
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:33,400
# Making mud pies
with gasoline #

884
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:34,840
# We're on
a hell ride #

885
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:38,640
# We're on a hell ride #

886
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:40,600
# Yeah #

887
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,360
# Mama's saddled
with a life degree #

888
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:50,560
# Working night and day,
10 mouths to feed #

889
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,200
# Mama's all alone #

890
