1
00:00:05,552 --> 00:00:09,352
I hope that I am still alive
when this film is shown,

2
00:00:09,423 --> 00:00:12,881
because this kind of thing
is dangerous...

3
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:16,053
...in the sense that one
considers oneself complete,

4
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,462
with the right to self-analysis,
when nothing is complete.

5
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:21,398
I am in the middle of my life.

6
00:00:21,468 --> 00:00:23,959
I am at the formative stage.
I am still an adolescent.

7
00:00:25,472 --> 00:00:31,104
So, if I am alive
when this film is seen...

8
00:00:33,647 --> 00:00:35,774
...that would mean that...

9
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,449
...everything is magical!

11
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,331
The first question I want to ask is:
Who are you?

12
00:02:48,381 --> 00:02:51,646
That's an impossible question
not to be asked.

13
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:58,414
The Emperor of China asked the
same question to Bodhidharma.

14
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:02,253
He had crossed India to come
to China...

15
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:06,493
...where he thought he could
fiind disciples.

16
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:09,034
So, the Emperor met him
and asked:

17
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:13,129
''I translated 2000 books.
What is my merit?''

18
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,905
And Bodhidharma answered:
''There is no merit!''

19
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:24,043
The Emperor said: ''Who are you
to speak to me like that?''

20
00:03:24,117 --> 00:03:28,315
And Bodhidharma replied:
''I don't know.'' And he left.

21
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:31,413
You can only know who you are
when you are dead.

22
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:36,619
You cease to exist when you say,
''That's what I am.''

23
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:41,565
As soon as I can define myself,
I am dead.

24
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:44,063
People consider me a mystic...

25
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:48,972
...because I treat themes that
others avoid treating.

26
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:56,005
But I consider myself
neither a mystic nor an artist.

27
00:03:58,051 --> 00:04:00,144
I am someone
who is playing games.

28
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:05,682
I am a gambler...

29
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:11,755
...just like people in casinos...

30
00:04:11,965 --> 00:04:15,867
...who spend all their money.

31
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:19,496
But as an artist, what I burn...

32
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:24,670
...is part of myself, my ego.

33
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:28,500
Write on my hand
with your finger.

34
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:51,353
I am extremely attracted to what
I don't understand.

35
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:56,061
My intuition tells me...

36
00:05:56,136 --> 00:06:02,132
...that therein lies
something important to study.

37
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:04,472
That's how I started to mime:

38
00:06:04,544 --> 00:06:06,739
I didn't understand what
physical expression was about.

39
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:43,315
Did you start to mime in Chile?

40
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:45,180
Yes.

41
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:51,555
I was a successful actor
at the university theater.

42
00:06:51,624 --> 00:06:54,218
Then I realized that my success
didn't come from me...

43
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:57,195
...but from the text I was reading.

44
00:06:58,264 --> 00:07:00,198
I asked myself: ''What is an actor?

45
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:03,064
A parrot that reads a text?

46
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:09,132
Or everything but the text?''

47
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:14,511
So I decided to found a theater
without any text.

48
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:17,439
That's how I discovered
the art of mime.

49
00:07:17,517 --> 00:07:23,217
It was in the early fifties.

50
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:27,453
I already had my company
in Paris at that time.

51
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:31,554
Alejandro came from Chile...

52
00:07:31,631 --> 00:07:35,499
...and was searching...

53
00:07:35,568 --> 00:07:40,232
...for an art form like mime.

54
00:07:40,306 --> 00:07:43,935
In Chile I had
a company of sixty people.

55
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,137
But I felt I had
nothing more to learn.

56
00:07:46,212 --> 00:07:49,306
So I decided to come to Europe.

57
00:07:49,382 --> 00:07:51,509
I had reached my limit.

58
00:07:51,584 --> 00:07:56,544
Then Alejandro and I met again in '62.

59
00:07:57,824 --> 00:08:01,225
He wrote ''The Cage'' for me.

60
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:06,061
He told me the story without miming:

61
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:10,569
A man walks and finds a cage,
a wall...

62
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:18,771
Alejandro didn't show it to me...

63
00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:22,212
...but at that time I had already
invented this concept...

64
00:08:22,282 --> 00:08:28,084
...that I didn't learn from Decroux,
my master:

65
00:08:28,154 --> 00:08:31,453
this point of support in space.

66
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:37,520
Alejandro felt it.
We were in a state of osmosis.

67
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:41,932
The character is a prisoner in
a square cage...

68
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:46,631
...that shrinks
as he is trying to get out.

69
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:50,938
He puts his hand out...

70
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,036
...to feel the air, freedom.

71
00:08:54,113 --> 00:08:55,808
He manages to get out...

72
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:58,043
...but finds himself prisoner
of a bigger cage.

73
00:08:58,117 --> 00:09:03,384
The cage shrinks and this time
he remains trapped.

74
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:17,527
The first person he finds
is stingy.

75
00:09:17,604 --> 00:09:22,769
He asks him for money,
and the man refuses.

76
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:28,041
The character is obsessed
with crime.

77
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:32,414
Knives are drawn,
but he rejects them.

78
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:35,178
Finally, he takes a knife.

79
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:37,980
He uses it...

80
00:09:38,057 --> 00:09:42,426
...because he is
refused money...

81
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:51,366
and he kills the stingy man.

82
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:55,669
He opens his chest and wants
to eat his heart,

83
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,707
but the heart is much too hard.

84
00:09:58,778 --> 00:10:01,338
This was a bad heart.

85
00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:06,713
So I rejected it.

86
00:10:06,786 --> 00:10:10,916
The second meeting
is with a woman.

87
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,515
At that point, Alejandro and I
had a discussion.

88
00:10:13,593 --> 00:10:17,222
He wanted me to eat the heart
of this beautiful woman.

89
00:10:17,297 --> 00:10:20,266
In the first meeting,
the heart was too tough to eat,

90
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:25,236
but when I met this beautiful woman,
I was to invite her to dance...

91
00:10:25,305 --> 00:10:27,865
then kill her, take her heart...

92
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:29,941
and eat it.

93
00:10:29,976 --> 00:10:32,376
I told him that I couldn't...

94
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:34,208
...and showed him
something else instead.

95
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,545
I imagined that this heart...

96
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:49,857
,,,was like transparent blood,
which vanishes.

97
00:10:51,564 --> 00:10:55,694
I never met this woman.
She was just an illusion...

98
00:10:56,536 --> 00:10:59,164
''Very good!'' said Alejandro.

99
00:10:59,238 --> 00:11:02,503
The third meeting
is with the children...

100
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:05,442
...who represent the future.

101
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:10,146
The man comes across this child--
actually, two children.

102
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:12,240
The first one is afraid
and manages to escape.

103
00:11:12,318 --> 00:11:15,412
The second stays behind,
and he kidnaps this child.

104
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:18,850
I remember I could hear mothers
in the audience...

105
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:21,826
indignant at the kidnapping.

106
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:25,220
Then I take out the knife...

107
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:27,095
and I kill the child.

108
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:30,325
It is unbearable.

109
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:33,099
It goes beyond Artaud...

110
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:36,733
in the concept of cruelty.

111
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:40,939
Then I take his heart...

112
00:11:42,048 --> 00:11:45,211
...and drink his blood.

113
00:11:45,284 --> 00:11:47,775
Through this act
I become the child.

114
00:11:47,854 --> 00:11:51,722
I realize that I have
destroyed posterity...

115
00:11:52,225 --> 00:11:55,456
...so I kill myself...

116
00:11:55,828 --> 00:11:59,696
...and give the heart back to
the child who comes to life again.

117
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:04,703
He then leaves, thanking me.

118
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:17,779
Panic.

119
00:12:18,384 --> 00:12:22,718
This is a reference
to the god ''Pan. ''

120
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:27,556
The Panic Movement
is a sexual act in its totality.

121
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:45,176
The Panic Movement was based
on the explosion of reason.

122
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:52,045
We knew what was to become
obvious for science today:

123
00:12:52,218 --> 00:12:56,917
that we are unable...

124
00:12:56,989 --> 00:13:02,359
...to explain the world...

125
00:13:02,462 --> 00:13:06,091
...solely through the means
of reason.

126
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:29,652
I wanted to do shows
that would never be repeated.

127
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:33,855
This increased my possibilities...

128
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:39,364
...of expression considerably.

129
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:45,862
We would use gelatins, rotten food,
massive destruction...

130
00:13:47,874 --> 00:13:49,569
and a lot of things.

131
00:13:51,677 --> 00:13:58,378
We now have the choice between
the absurd and mystery.

132
00:13:59,685 --> 00:14:04,315
It's the scientific choice:
the absurd or mystery.

133
00:14:04,657 --> 00:14:07,888
We are not obsessed
with the absurd...

134
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,928
we are not fanatics
about the absurd...

135
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:11,861
we are not fanatics
about mystery...

136
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:13,990
we are not soldiers
of confusion.

137
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:17,467
What we are for is...

138
00:14:17,537 --> 00:14:19,232
uncertainty...

139
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:23,935
this impossibility to explain...

140
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:28,344
the fact that time and space
is an illusion.

141
00:14:28,414 --> 00:14:30,109
This explosion...

142
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:36,185
shows us that we cannot live...

143
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:40,086
holding on to this
overwhelming reason...

144
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:42,787
which prevented
us from flourishing.

145
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:16,661
We broke off with surrealism...

146
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:20,563
because Breton had created
a surrealist respectablity...

147
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:22,498
that we wanted to go beyond.

148
00:15:22,568 --> 00:15:26,129
He didn't accept science fiction,
he wanted the fantastic and the poetic.

149
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,164
He didn't like rock music.

150
00:15:29,242 --> 00:15:32,439
He didn't like--
let's not make a list.

151
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:35,742
He didn't like anything
in the world.

152
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:40,184
Surrealism had become an incredibly
petit bourgeois movement.

153
00:15:42,555 --> 00:15:45,183
Would you like to talk about
your theatrical work?

154
00:15:45,258 --> 00:15:49,524
I started in Mexico--
A wild place--

155
00:15:49,595 --> 00:15:52,257
with avant garde theater.

156
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:56,893
My first act there
was Beckett's '' Endgame.''

157
00:15:57,036 --> 00:16:00,096
They called Samuel Beckett a dog,
a son-of-a-bitch.

158
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:01,936
He was insulted.
I was insulted.

159
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:03,168
They vomited on me.

160
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:06,211
All the critics, everyone.
As if we were degenerates.

161
00:16:06,846 --> 00:16:11,783
Then they were embarrassed
when Beckett got the Nobel Prize.

162
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:13,580
It was scandalous.

163
00:16:13,653 --> 00:16:17,919
I did Ionesco, Exit the King

164
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,584
Those shows lasted
for several years.

165
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,150
I did about a hundred plays.

166
00:16:22,228 --> 00:16:27,825
Adamov, Beckett,
Ionesco, Strindberg...

167
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:33,136
...theater of the absurd, Arrabal...

168
00:16:33,272 --> 00:16:35,638
jodorowsky is insanely talented.

169
00:16:35,741 --> 00:16:39,507
Quite literally, he's talented
to the point of madness.

170
00:16:41,514 --> 00:16:47,749
But, as with all madmen,
there's a method to his madness.

171
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,278
He's a mathematical madman.
He's a divine madman.

172
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:58,162
He's a constructivist madman.

173
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:04,664
And this madness, this intelligence,
this talent--

174
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:07,205
for there's no talent
without madness--

175
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:12,904
find their unique expression
in directing, I believe.

176
00:17:24,256 --> 00:17:29,250
You directed ''Fando & Lis''
on stage and then on screen.

177
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:33,264
Yes, I loved that play--
I played a role in it...

178
00:17:33,332 --> 00:17:35,163
one of three main characters...

179
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:37,395
and I loved it.

180
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,199
I loved this play by Arrabal...

181
00:17:39,271 --> 00:17:42,900
because it had
a sort of childish purity...

182
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:47,103
...in a sadomasochisticworld.

183
00:17:47,213 --> 00:17:49,613
It was poetry to me.

184
00:17:49,682 --> 00:17:55,120
I produced the play, we made no money,
but we loved it.

185
00:17:55,187 --> 00:17:58,418
So we ran out of cash;
we had to stop.

186
00:17:58,491 --> 00:18:02,291
I remember I cried.
We were sad to have to stop.

187
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:05,125
For we loved that play.

188
00:18:05,564 --> 00:18:09,330
Then I decided to make films...

189
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:17,202
...and asked Arrabal if I could
adapt his play in my own way...

190
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:22,347
...without a screenplay.

191
00:18:22,415 --> 00:18:25,077
I filmed on weekends...

192
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:30,111
...with what memory of the play
that remained in my head.

193
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:36,889
The performance of'' Fando & Lis''...

194
00:18:36,962 --> 00:18:39,556
...and the film that followed...

195
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:43,761
...are a total mystery for me.

196
00:18:43,836 --> 00:18:50,765
I never understood it,
and I don't want to.

197
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:58,046
The day I understand it
I will love it less.

198
00:18:58,551 --> 00:19:01,281
I just saw '' Fando & Lis'' again.

199
00:19:01,353 --> 00:19:05,551
Thirty years later I am impressed
with the intensity...

200
00:19:05,624 --> 00:19:10,288
...of my artistic determination.

201
00:19:11,297 --> 00:19:16,325
It is a pure piece of art
without any concession.

202
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:20,266
I didn't care about how
the audience would react,

203
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:25,470
whether they'd be bored or shocked.

204
00:19:25,744 --> 00:19:29,908
I didn't care
about all the technical research,

205
00:19:30,516 --> 00:19:34,976
like finding a rhythm for a scene
for the sake of the audience.

206
00:19:35,054 --> 00:19:39,855
I didn't work with the audience in mind.
I just did it with all my guts.

207
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:42,484
You can see the result.

208
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:48,833
I am proud of this film
because it is real.

209
00:19:49,602 --> 00:19:56,007
In Mexico,
no one expected such a film.

210
00:19:56,475 --> 00:20:01,344
People literally wanted to kill me!

211
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:07,543
I had to rush out of the Acapulco
Film Festival hidden in a car...

212
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,112
...because they wanted to lynch me.

213
00:21:33,272 --> 00:21:36,901
''The Holy Mountain''
begins like a fairy tale.

214
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:40,468
I play two characters:

215
00:21:40,546 --> 00:21:43,606
the magician and the thief
who speaks with my voice.

216
00:21:45,084 --> 00:21:48,781
The thief represents the ego...

217
00:21:48,854 --> 00:21:51,345
...and the magician
the essential being.

218
00:21:53,892 --> 00:22:00,695
From a fairy tale
the film evolves...

219
00:22:00,766 --> 00:22:02,961
...into realistic cinema...

220
00:22:03,268 --> 00:22:08,968
...with a hand-held camera and
little means to reach the truth.

221
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:14,775
And the magician becomes real,
like you and me.

222
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:02,610
Art has always been present
in my life.

223
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:07,489
I never made any distinctions
between making a film and my life.

224
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:12,595
''The Holy Mountain''
was an essential experience.

225
00:24:12,664 --> 00:24:17,829
At the time I was obsessed
with reaching enlightenment.

226
00:24:17,903 --> 00:24:22,863
So I thought that the film could be
as sacred as an initiation...

227
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:25,933
...or a holy book,
and we had to live it.

228
00:24:26,011 --> 00:24:30,107
In Mexico, a man
knocked on my door and said:

229
00:24:30,182 --> 00:24:35,779
'' Mr.jodorowsky, I'm here because
I want to study enlightenment.''

230
00:24:36,221 --> 00:24:41,989
I was delighted.

231
00:24:42,427 --> 00:24:47,160
I told him he had
to find himself, to purify...

232
00:24:47,232 --> 00:24:50,065
...all the things gurus say.

233
00:24:51,203 --> 00:24:55,663
He interrupted me, saying:
'' No, that's not it.''

234
00:24:55,741 --> 00:24:57,572
I said, ''What do you mean
that's not it?''

235
00:24:57,643 --> 00:25:00,043
''I want to study theater.
Talking about illumination,

236
00:25:00,112 --> 00:25:02,774
I see that you use
a lot of lights in theater!''

237
00:25:05,951 --> 00:25:10,513
I understood my mistake.

238
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:16,884
All this Chinese,japanese
and Tibetan stuff...

239
00:25:17,162 --> 00:25:19,960
...goes directly to my balls.

240
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:25,095
Illumination doesn't exist.

241
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:30,073
We are all illuminated;
we just don't realize it.

242
00:25:30,142 --> 00:25:32,474
The great mystery is to be alive,
here and now.

243
00:25:32,544 --> 00:25:39,541
Nothing else
is as important as that.

244
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,513
It's an incredible mystery.

245
00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:44,818
What more are we looking for?

246
00:25:46,391 --> 00:25:48,757
Do you consider yourself
a magician of cinema?

247
00:25:48,827 --> 00:25:53,662
I would like to be, but I am not,

248
00:25:53,732 --> 00:25:57,133
and it's not because of modesty.

249
00:25:57,202 --> 00:26:03,937
I have only done six or seven films,
which is very little.

250
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:07,509
Cinema is a matter of practice,
a bit like karate.

251
00:26:07,579 --> 00:26:12,482
You punch and punch
until you achieve magic.

252
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:16,112
But I haven't punched enough
to find the magic.

253
00:26:16,188 --> 00:26:20,090
As a matter of fact,
I haven't even begun to make films.

254
00:26:20,158 --> 00:26:24,219
It's only now that I begin
to see that.

255
00:26:28,634 --> 00:26:33,264
For me cinema is highly important.

256
00:26:37,242 --> 00:26:41,679
When making a film, one disappears.

257
00:26:41,813 --> 00:26:44,247
The person who made my films
is not me.

258
00:26:44,316 --> 00:26:48,343
I was always like a medium
in a trance.

259
00:27:05,737 --> 00:27:10,401
When I choose an actor,
my whole body trembles.

260
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:15,037
One actor is one film.
Another actor is like another film.

261
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:19,782
That's important to know.

262
00:27:19,851 --> 00:27:24,948
If you make a mistake,
the film is spoiled.

263
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:29,527
Sometimes, I follow my intuition,

264
00:27:29,594 --> 00:27:32,290
and I don't know if they
will act well and become sick,

265
00:27:32,364 --> 00:27:40,396
but therein lies an instinct,
a desire, an unconscious order.

266
00:27:40,872 --> 00:27:44,035
It makes me sick
because I can be wrong.

267
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:48,603
For ''Santa Sangre,''
I chose my son Axel,

268
00:27:49,181 --> 00:27:53,117
I didn't know if it was because I
loved him as a father...

269
00:27:53,185 --> 00:27:56,120
...or if it was
because of his acting skills.

270
00:27:56,188 --> 00:27:59,316
So I decided to have him pass
an audition.

271
00:27:59,825 --> 00:28:05,320
I went to his examination at Marceau's
mime school and was convinced.

272
00:28:05,397 --> 00:28:12,394
But I was still afraid I had made
a mistake because he was my son.

273
00:28:12,671 --> 00:28:15,970
So we discussed it,
my life is in your hands.

274
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:19,568
If you are wrong, we're done.
If I'm wrong, we're done.

275
00:28:20,012 --> 00:28:23,140
For ''The Rainbow Thief',
everything was imposed on me.

276
00:28:23,215 --> 00:28:26,480
I fully assumed this nightmare.

277
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:33,549
The producer wanted to offer
a present to his wife...

278
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:39,624
...by making a film
out of her script.

279
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:49,905
She is a talented writer, and somehow
was influenced by my filmmaking.

280
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,972
She has her world,
she's a good writer...

281
00:28:55,047 --> 00:28:58,278
and I found her script interesting.

282
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,318
But the producer warned me...

283
00:29:00,385 --> 00:29:03,786
...that the film would cost
at least 10 million dollars...

284
00:29:03,855 --> 00:29:10,954
...so I had to adapt to American
business rules-- I was not free.

285
00:29:13,498 --> 00:29:17,059
I had three detectives
spying on me...

286
00:29:17,135 --> 00:29:20,229
...to make sure that
I wouldn't change any lines.

287
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:23,900
Every time I wanted to make
even a small change...

288
00:29:23,975 --> 00:29:28,241
...I had to call the writer
and the producer.

289
00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:33,541
He hired stars...

290
00:29:33,618 --> 00:29:37,987
...like Omar Sharif, Peter O'Toole,
and Christopher Lee,

291
00:29:38,156 --> 00:29:40,147
and he warned me
that in case of an argument,

292
00:29:40,225 --> 00:29:42,625
I had to leave...not them,

293
00:29:42,994 --> 00:29:47,693
so I had to be careful...

294
00:29:47,766 --> 00:29:52,066
..not to argue with them.

295
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,638
It was a good massage for my ego.

296
00:29:57,709 --> 00:30:02,442
It was like receiving 300 blows
with a stick every day.

297
00:30:02,514 --> 00:30:05,506
But I managed to adapt and deal
with the new circumstances.

298
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:10,021
I became friends
with the photographer by adapting.

299
00:30:10,355 --> 00:30:13,518
On my other films,
I was a total dictator.

300
00:30:13,592 --> 00:30:17,619
For ''The Rainbow Thief,''
I was a nobody.

301
00:30:17,696 --> 00:30:23,100
The producer saw the rushes
before I did and would say...

302
00:30:23,168 --> 00:30:26,433
'' Please add a close-up there.''

303
00:30:26,505 --> 00:30:30,908
I felt like I was going to have
a ''balls attack''!

304
00:30:30,976 --> 00:30:34,434
Eventually I adapted,
and it was good for me.

305
00:30:34,513 --> 00:30:38,176
I learned how to do it,
and it became useful in the end.

306
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:42,448
For ''Tusk,''
the producer swindled me.

307
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:46,252
He made me sign
for an elephant fight,

308
00:30:46,358 --> 00:30:48,690
but in India it is impossible
to have elephants...

309
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,459
...closer than 15 meters
to each other on the set.

310
00:30:53,532 --> 00:30:56,968
All I needed was one shot with the
elephant close enough to touch...

311
00:30:57,035 --> 00:31:00,232
...at least once for me
to claim there'd been a fight.

312
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:05,504
On the day of shooting,
inspectors came to check the distance.

313
00:31:05,577 --> 00:31:11,641
I began to pray. First take, nothing;
second take, nothing.

314
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:15,786
At the sixth take, one elephant
just got mad and started to charge.

315
00:31:16,388 --> 00:31:18,754
I had my fight-- what a miracle!

316
00:31:26,565 --> 00:31:28,897
There is a lot of violence
in your films...

317
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:31,333
There is no violence.

318
00:31:32,037 --> 00:31:34,904
The explosion of galaxies
is violent.

319
00:31:34,973 --> 00:31:40,707
A comet falling on jupiter...

320
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:44,237
...making seven big holes
is violent.

321
00:31:44,749 --> 00:31:48,344
The birth of a child
is very violent.

322
00:31:49,087 --> 00:31:57,017
Someone passing away--
and I have assisted dying people--

323
00:31:57,128 --> 00:31:58,561
I go sometimes.

324
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:02,396
Even if the person is quietly dying,
it's immense violence...

325
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:05,762
this loss of consciousness.

326
00:32:05,837 --> 00:32:09,534
Life is violent;
the circulation of blood,

327
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:12,577
the heart beating,
all this is violent.

328
00:32:12,644 --> 00:32:17,206
But there are two types of violence:
creative and destructive.

329
00:32:22,454 --> 00:32:24,718
I am creating art.

330
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:32,490
And as I was born in a male body,
my art is virile.

331
00:32:33,031 --> 00:32:36,489
Because I was born
in this virile skin.

332
00:32:36,568 --> 00:32:39,093
I've chosen
to be born as a man.

333
00:32:39,638 --> 00:32:45,133
Sometimes I have feminine
or angelical touches,

334
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:48,345
but there is a strong
virile base.

335
00:32:48,413 --> 00:32:50,142
That's the way it is.

336
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,843
He came to see me because he liked
my film '' El Topo.''

337
00:33:46,971 --> 00:33:49,667
I decided to use my creativity
in something different,

338
00:33:49,741 --> 00:33:51,732
in order to extend my limits.

339
00:34:27,846 --> 00:34:30,371
Another film which remained
as a project is ''Dune. ''

340
00:34:30,448 --> 00:34:32,075
I gave it all up--

341
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:36,018
the contracts, everything--
I was totally broke.

342
00:34:37,055 --> 00:34:42,049
Michel Seydoux,
who did a good job releasing...

343
00:34:42,127 --> 00:34:44,891
...'' El Topo'' and '' Holy Mountain''
in Paris...

344
00:34:44,963 --> 00:34:48,455
...asked me to make a film
with him.

345
00:34:48,933 --> 00:34:52,733
I proposed '' Dune.''

346
00:34:53,004 --> 00:34:56,064
In fact, I hadn't even
read the book.

347
00:34:56,141 --> 00:34:58,006
Someone had simply told me
what the book was about.

348
00:34:58,076 --> 00:35:01,842
So we bought the rights
for '' Dune''.

349
00:35:01,946 --> 00:35:05,245
And reading it,
I realized he was right.

350
00:35:05,316 --> 00:35:06,840
We had to do it.

351
00:35:06,918 --> 00:35:12,356
Besides, I just liked the story
and needed to support my family.

352
00:35:21,366 --> 00:35:24,358
It was a wonderful failure.

353
00:35:24,436 --> 00:35:27,837
That failure proved to be an ally.

354
00:35:27,972 --> 00:35:33,205
The problem was that the producer
was a multimillionaire.

355
00:35:36,314 --> 00:35:38,714
The lesson of this experience is
that one should never work...

356
00:35:38,783 --> 00:35:43,413
...with people who don't need
to earn money with art...

357
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:48,425
...because they can abandon a project
just like that.

358
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,257
For them it's like an insect bite.

359
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:54,025
For me, '' Dune'' was not a failure.

360
00:35:54,098 --> 00:35:59,832
The film was not made, that's all.

361
00:36:00,238 --> 00:36:04,641
What remains
is the wonderful preparation.

362
00:36:04,709 --> 00:36:08,406
We were all euphoric.

363
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:14,382
The film remains what it should be,
a mirage between the dunes.

364
00:36:14,652 --> 00:36:16,517
Perhaps inside myself
I had the intuition...

365
00:36:16,588 --> 00:36:19,580
...that the film wouldn't be made.

366
00:36:19,991 --> 00:36:22,585
For me the film remains there,
and that's okay.

367
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:35,799
I saw Moebius' drawing for the
covers of science-fiiction books...

368
00:36:36,174 --> 00:36:40,440
...and I was struck by his
''non-scientific'' vision of space.

369
00:36:40,512 --> 00:36:43,379
Such artistic imagination.

370
00:36:43,715 --> 00:36:48,345
Then I saw his work in '' Blueberry,''
the comic strip.

371
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:55,091
I saw that he acted like
a film director or a cinematographer.

372
00:36:55,193 --> 00:36:58,458
He had a cinematicvision
in his drawings...

373
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,862
...so I thought he'd be perfect
for the job.

374
00:37:01,366 --> 00:37:05,769
I came in, and two people
were going out.

375
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:12,002
One of them shouted:
''It's him, it's Moebius.''

376
00:37:12,076 --> 00:37:15,307
The other person rushed towards me,
in a nice way,

377
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:21,216
and said: ''So you are Moebius.
I am happy to meet you.''

378
00:37:21,286 --> 00:37:24,278
The person I had before me
was Alejandro jodorowsky.

379
00:37:24,355 --> 00:37:31,386
He proposed that I work on
his latest film project, '' Dune.''

380
00:37:31,462 --> 00:37:39,096
In fact I had just finished
Frank Herbert's novel '' Dune''...

381
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:41,502
...three months before,
and it came as a shock.

382
00:37:41,573 --> 00:37:48,001
I thought thatAmerican cinema,
which was influenced by NASA,

383
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,173
was creating ''flying refrigerators.''

384
00:37:51,249 --> 00:37:55,015
There was absolutely no imagination
in the spacecraft.

385
00:37:55,086 --> 00:38:02,322
I wanted a vessel full of color,
practically living entities.

386
00:38:02,393 --> 00:38:10,129
Look at this pirate vessel
which can hide like a fish.

387
00:38:13,371 --> 00:38:17,034
Giger is the Swiss designer
who conceived the 'Alien''monster.

388
00:38:17,108 --> 00:38:21,477
Look at the head. You can see
the resemblance to ''Alien.''

389
00:38:23,448 --> 00:38:25,939
That's the castle
of the Harkonnen baron...

390
00:38:26,017 --> 00:38:29,475
...who was to be played
by Orson Welles.

391
00:38:29,821 --> 00:38:33,848
There were several worlds, and each
planet had its own designer...

392
00:38:33,925 --> 00:38:35,790
...and its own music score.

393
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,762
Pink Floyd and Magma
were to compose.

394
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:45,731
Different musicians
were to convey...

395
00:38:45,803 --> 00:38:48,931
the world of each planet.

396
00:38:49,007 --> 00:38:52,670
Dali was to be the mad emperor
of the galaxy.

397
00:38:52,744 --> 00:38:56,407
'' Dune'' was supposed to be
an extraordinary fresco.

398
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:07,184
Seydoux was thrilled with Alejandro's
fire and enthusiasm,

399
00:39:08,593 --> 00:39:15,089
the ambition of the project; we were
all carried away by the delirium.

400
00:39:54,105 --> 00:39:56,938
I was responsible for
the preparation of all the actors...

401
00:39:57,008 --> 00:39:59,499
...including Brontis, Alejandro's son.

402
00:39:59,644 --> 00:40:06,277
They had to be warriors,
martial arts experts,

403
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:08,716
so I had to prepare them to fight.

404
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:13,921
I also had a role,
that of a musician...

405
00:40:14,058 --> 00:40:18,961
...who was a killer at the same time.

406
00:40:21,232 --> 00:40:29,867
My guitar was like a weapon,
and I learned to fight with it.

407
00:40:32,877 --> 00:40:38,509
During this preparation,
my emotions would zigzag...

408
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:44,317
...between great admiration
and outraged disapproval.

409
00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:49,321
Alejandro's way of thinking
shocked me.

410
00:40:51,062 --> 00:40:56,694
For instance, one day we had to choose
the costumes of the Harkonnens.

411
00:40:59,837 --> 00:41:02,601
He covered his eyes with one hand
and went through the bookshelf,

412
00:41:02,673 --> 00:41:06,734
took a book, by chance it was
Titian's paintings,

413
00:41:06,811 --> 00:41:09,712
brought it to the table
and banged it down,

414
00:41:09,781 --> 00:41:16,744
opened it to a page and blindly
pointed his finger and said:

415
00:41:17,155 --> 00:41:21,387
''It's going to be like that!''

416
00:41:23,895 --> 00:41:29,390
At first it drove me crazy, but
then I realized that he was right,

417
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:33,164
we could start from anything.

418
00:41:34,972 --> 00:41:38,908
At any rate,
Alejandro had a--

419
00:41:40,478 --> 00:41:41,570
how could I say--

420
00:41:41,646 --> 00:41:45,673
a belief,
or a set of beliefs...

421
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:50,318
that not knowing...

422
00:41:50,755 --> 00:41:53,189
that going blindly into something
gives a chance...

423
00:41:53,257 --> 00:41:57,421
to that mysterious,
all-knowing part of ourselves...

424
00:41:57,495 --> 00:41:58,655
to express itself.

425
00:41:58,729 --> 00:42:02,096
What we didn't achieve in '' Dune''
we achieved in comic strips,

426
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:06,762
thanks to the failure of'' Dune.''

427
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:09,636
I began this immense activity
in comic strips...

428
00:42:09,707 --> 00:42:13,541
...with millions of readers.
I love comic books.

429
00:42:13,845 --> 00:42:19,784
The ''Incal'' is the realization
of'' Dune.''

430
00:42:20,785 --> 00:42:22,753
But we didn't know it at the time.

431
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:25,152
Maybe Alejandro did because...

432
00:42:25,223 --> 00:42:33,153
...his brain works
like 3,000 crazy computers!

433
00:42:33,798 --> 00:42:38,792
At first I had a dream where I was
looking for the inner God.

434
00:42:40,571 --> 00:42:44,701
I saw two pyramids and decided
to go inside.

435
00:42:44,775 --> 00:42:49,803
Then I exploded in the light.

436
00:42:49,881 --> 00:42:51,439
When I awoke I was happy...

437
00:42:51,515 --> 00:42:53,244
...and that's how I got the idea
for ''Incal''...

438
00:42:53,317 --> 00:42:59,779
...which represents our inner God,
the center of our unconscious.

439
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:06,057
Alejandro was telling me the story
and miming at the same time...

440
00:43:08,266 --> 00:43:13,329
...and I was free to interrupt him
at any moment.

441
00:43:14,205 --> 00:43:19,165
So, I was creating
to my heart's content.

442
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:26,311
I played the part of the serious man,
and he was the madman.

443
00:43:27,451 --> 00:43:32,718
So I was happy to interrupt him
and say:

444
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:37,523
'' Look here, there's no logic in that.''

445
00:43:40,131 --> 00:43:45,694
And he would go in another direction.

446
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:50,639
He was never out of imagination
or madness.

447
00:44:35,653 --> 00:44:42,718
When the first part was completed,
we went through the whole story.

448
00:44:43,394 --> 00:44:47,353
Alejandro's well-organized brain
was very useful...

449
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:50,059
...in keeping track of everything.

450
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:56,231
I made notes of dialogue
and the scenes.

451
00:44:57,241 --> 00:45:04,272
It took four to six hours
to do a 60-page album.

452
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:08,575
We did the six volumes like that.

453
00:45:08,652 --> 00:45:13,180
That is extremely unusual because
everything was done in one go:

454
00:45:13,257 --> 00:45:20,493
the story, the scenes, the dialogue.

455
00:45:22,867 --> 00:45:25,631
Working with comic strip designers
is a delight.

456
00:45:25,703 --> 00:45:29,230
They love their art.

457
00:45:30,107 --> 00:45:32,905
It is a commercial art,;
they are paid by the page.

458
00:45:32,977 --> 00:45:38,847
It can be laborious, but they
are as delicate as jewelers.

459
00:45:40,251 --> 00:45:44,585
The relationship is different
according to their personality.

460
00:45:44,655 --> 00:45:48,455
You have to propose stories
they can love.

461
00:45:49,093 --> 00:45:53,928
If you succeed in reaching
their world...

462
00:45:53,998 --> 00:45:56,990
...the collaboration
can be wonderful.

463
00:45:57,068 --> 00:46:00,765
Alejandro knows how to keep...

464
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:04,831
his personal obsessions...

465
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:07,969
...and be receptive to each
designer's sensitivity...

466
00:46:09,046 --> 00:46:10,877
...at the same time.

467
00:46:10,948 --> 00:46:14,042
That's part of his genius.

468
00:46:14,385 --> 00:46:19,914
He gives them their appropriate
fuel in the form of scenarios.

469
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:52,284
We start with a small thing...

470
00:46:53,958 --> 00:46:58,759
...and suddenly it starts to take on
unexpected proportions of grandeur.

471
00:46:58,829 --> 00:47:00,490
Hurrah for greatness!

472
00:47:00,564 --> 00:47:04,796
We have to see Man
in all his weakness.

473
00:47:08,305 --> 00:47:13,265
We have a brain that can go
across the universe,

474
00:47:13,777 --> 00:47:19,409
but we can also shit like a baby,

475
00:47:20,584 --> 00:47:23,348
like my professor.

476
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:28,551
He goes from a state of diarrhea
to that of the most sublime thoughts.

477
00:47:29,126 --> 00:47:33,426
It is not autobiographical because
this professor is impotent...

478
00:47:33,497 --> 00:47:36,466
...and I have five children.

479
00:47:36,534 --> 00:47:38,832
But on the other hand,
parts of him are like me,

480
00:47:38,903 --> 00:47:41,895
the splendid and ridiculous side
of the philosopher.

481
00:47:44,341 --> 00:47:47,139
Today, I am in a bad mood.

482
00:47:47,211 --> 00:47:51,341
I don't know why,
but I am in an awful mood.

483
00:47:54,919 --> 00:47:57,114
I don't want to be anyone's
spiritual master.

484
00:47:57,788 --> 00:48:01,724
If that is what people are
projecting on me,

485
00:48:01,792 --> 00:48:06,491
because of my age, my white hair,
that's their problem.

486
00:48:06,564 --> 00:48:08,794
I don't accept it.

487
00:48:08,866 --> 00:48:11,164
I give my lecture of Wednesdays,
that's all.

488
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:14,860
Take me as I am.

489
00:48:14,939 --> 00:48:17,100
Some people think
that I am a crook,

490
00:48:17,174 --> 00:48:20,735
others the head of a sect.

491
00:48:21,645 --> 00:48:24,239
I begin the lecture with an OM.

492
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:43,960
We've done Om, which in French
means ''man,'' so let's do ''woman.''

493
00:48:44,034 --> 00:48:45,433
''Woman.''

494
00:48:45,502 --> 00:48:47,800
It's not Sanskrit.
We are not a sect.

495
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:50,567
That is the sound needed...

496
00:48:50,641 --> 00:48:53,735
...to induce calm
before the lecture begins.

497
00:48:54,478 --> 00:48:58,505
I could say ''Coca-Cola'';
it would be the same thing.

498
00:48:58,616 --> 00:49:00,880
One day I told myself that I came
to this world...

499
00:49:00,951 --> 00:49:04,443
...not only to accomplish for myself
but also to give something back.

500
00:49:04,521 --> 00:49:07,547
There are already people
working with...

501
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:12,585
...humanitarian or charity
organizations,

502
00:49:13,264 --> 00:49:17,564
but there is also an enormous
emotional catastrophe on the planet.

503
00:49:20,371 --> 00:49:22,236
There is a village,

504
00:49:22,306 --> 00:49:25,275
which is hidden in the shadow
of a mountain.

505
00:49:25,342 --> 00:49:27,537
Everybody is suffering
from the lack of light.

506
00:49:27,611 --> 00:49:30,637
One day the eldest of this village
heads for the mountain...

507
00:49:30,714 --> 00:49:33,182
...with a teaspoon in his hands.

508
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:37,687
The others ask him
what he intends to do.

509
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:43,426
He replies that he is going to
move the mountain.

510
00:49:43,861 --> 00:49:46,796
'' But you will never succeed!''
they cry out.

511
00:49:46,864 --> 00:49:51,961
'' No, I will never succeed,
but somebody has to start!''

512
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:55,696
So, like this man
with a teaspoon,

513
00:49:55,773 --> 00:50:00,073
I started to cure
the emotional illness of mankind.

514
00:50:00,477 --> 00:50:04,004
I said I would give
a lecture per week...

515
00:50:04,081 --> 00:50:08,745
...as long as the participants
contributed to paying the rent...

516
00:50:09,853 --> 00:50:12,447
...at the end of each lecture.

517
00:50:12,523 --> 00:50:14,855
Well, they have been paying
for 14 years now!

518
00:50:15,426 --> 00:50:21,422
A seminarist asks another:

519
00:50:21,498 --> 00:50:25,195
'' How can you smoke
during the prayers?

520
00:50:25,836 --> 00:50:31,365
It is strictly forbidden!''

521
00:50:34,578 --> 00:50:36,569
The other replies:
''Well, it is easy.

522
00:50:36,647 --> 00:50:40,447
I asked for permission to pray
while smoking!''

523
00:50:45,489 --> 00:50:50,153
In the book I wrote in '83 I spoke
of Alejandro as a spiritual father.

524
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:55,459
He gave me answers
no one else could give.

525
00:50:56,166 --> 00:50:58,396
For each question he had an answer.

526
00:51:02,439 --> 00:51:04,498
He encouraged me to write this book
despite the fact...

527
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,236
...that I am not a writer.

528
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:08,710
I didn't find my life
particularly interesting.

529
00:51:08,912 --> 00:51:11,881
But I wrote and wrote,

530
00:51:11,949 --> 00:51:13,974
and eventually it was published.

531
00:51:14,118 --> 00:51:17,110
From then on I have felt
more at ease with myself...

532
00:51:17,187 --> 00:51:20,088
with my family, my mother...

533
00:51:20,157 --> 00:51:22,352
and my normal agressiveness.

534
00:51:22,426 --> 00:51:24,394
It was like an undigested meal
I had to vomit on paper.

535
00:51:24,461 --> 00:51:26,588
Now I really feel better.

536
00:51:29,166 --> 00:51:36,663
The only answer I had for violence
was violence,

537
00:51:37,007 --> 00:51:40,272
yet humor can be just as effective--
though I don't have much.

538
00:51:40,744 --> 00:51:45,841
Alejandro taught me that giving up
a useless fight...

539
00:51:45,916 --> 00:51:49,147
...is not necessarily
self-devaluating.

540
00:51:49,653 --> 00:51:53,145
If you're going to fight,
the adversary must be worthwhile.

541
00:51:54,625 --> 00:51:58,721
As he said, when I give
karate lessons,

542
00:51:58,796 --> 00:52:02,664
and I give 25 lessons a week,
I am paid.

543
00:52:02,966 --> 00:52:07,164
So if I get angry in a traffic jam
and I start fighting,

544
00:52:07,237 --> 00:52:11,003
it is as if I am giving
a free lesson.

545
00:52:11,475 --> 00:52:14,171
So it's not worth it!

546
00:52:16,246 --> 00:52:20,182
Damn, damn, damn,
I am no more than shit,

547
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,741
and don't tell me I am something.

548
00:52:23,053 --> 00:52:28,286
This cruelty helped me to go
further into myself.

549
00:52:31,929 --> 00:52:36,423
I knew I was poetic,
but I was afraid...

550
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:40,095
...of certain strong
and strange feelings.

551
00:52:40,337 --> 00:52:45,468
This excess and violence
in Alejandro moved me.

552
00:52:45,576 --> 00:52:46,838
Let's do this.

553
00:52:47,744 --> 00:52:50,872
I follow her and she follows me.

554
00:53:31,755 --> 00:53:34,417
We did a very peculiar massage.

555
00:53:34,825 --> 00:53:38,818
15 people
were gathered together.

556
00:53:38,896 --> 00:53:46,029
Alejandro's students were learning
massage and working on the ego.

557
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:54,268
We were ready to experiment
with adventures of...

558
00:53:54,344 --> 00:53:59,213
...physical and psychological caress.

559
00:53:59,283 --> 00:54:01,342
For awakening!

560
00:54:01,418 --> 00:54:05,411
So this massage was very special...

561
00:54:05,689 --> 00:54:09,921
...in the sense that everybody there
became a member of my family.

562
00:54:09,993 --> 00:54:11,654
You are my grandfather,
you are my grandmother,

563
00:54:11,728 --> 00:54:14,288
you are my dad, you are my brother,
you are my sister!

564
00:54:14,364 --> 00:54:18,357
We had contact for an hour.

565
00:54:18,669 --> 00:54:21,001
When the contact was over,

566
00:54:21,071 --> 00:54:23,767
this strange experience
immediately became real.

567
00:54:23,874 --> 00:54:28,402
In the end, everybody was
entirely absorbed in their role.

568
00:54:28,478 --> 00:54:31,003
We switched off the lights.

569
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:32,742
I have to say thatAlejandro
was absent.

570
00:54:32,816 --> 00:54:35,649
I was alone with these people.

571
00:54:36,019 --> 00:54:40,888
I was panic-stricken at this moment,
but that quickly disappeared.

572
00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:44,018
I don't really know what happened,

573
00:54:44,094 --> 00:54:46,688
but everybody was moved.

574
00:54:46,863 --> 00:54:50,697
Because in the dark,
it was really something else.

575
00:54:52,402 --> 00:54:54,063
It went on and on.

576
00:54:54,137 --> 00:55:01,236
In the end, we were really
in a strange mood.

577
00:55:02,512 --> 00:55:07,381
It began to reach proportions
no one expected.

578
00:55:08,752 --> 00:55:12,381
So, at the end of this contact,

579
00:55:12,456 --> 00:55:18,918
I disposed the people in the room
in the form of a spaceship.

580
00:55:19,329 --> 00:55:23,891
Some people were
the hull of the spaceship:

581
00:55:23,967 --> 00:55:29,428
others were the engines,
others were the sensitive organs.

582
00:55:30,307 --> 00:55:32,798
It was an act of science fiction!

583
00:55:32,876 --> 00:55:35,970
Then, when everybody was ready,

584
00:55:36,046 --> 00:55:42,110
playing the role of the father and
the engine of the ship,

585
00:55:42,185 --> 00:55:44,745
the mother, and the envelope,

586
00:55:44,821 --> 00:55:48,780
the grandmother and the radar,

587
00:55:48,859 --> 00:55:52,090
the grandfather and the armament,

588
00:55:52,162 --> 00:56:01,195
the brother was a sort of pilot-fish
for this spaceship.

589
00:56:02,039 --> 00:56:06,373
So we were all ready...

590
00:56:06,443 --> 00:56:14,316
...after this unbelievable massage!

591
00:56:14,384 --> 00:56:18,753
Everybody started to believe
in their roles.

592
00:56:18,822 --> 00:56:22,314
The spaceship was complete,
and I was the passenger...

593
00:56:22,392 --> 00:56:24,519
...and the captain of it.

594
00:56:25,195 --> 00:56:29,996
I gave the destination, which was
the center of the universe,

595
00:56:30,834 --> 00:56:34,235
the return to the eternal father.

596
00:56:35,038 --> 00:56:41,534
It started like that,
and we took this trip.

597
00:56:42,379 --> 00:56:47,339
All the people who participated
in this little psycho-drama,

598
00:56:47,417 --> 00:56:53,720
this psycho-situation,
benefitted from it.

599
00:56:54,057 --> 00:57:00,155
They helped me by giving me the
strength to go through this adventure.

600
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:05,395
On the other hand,
they accompanied me,

601
00:57:05,469 --> 00:57:09,405
and would not have experienced
such an adventure without me.

602
00:57:09,473 --> 00:57:13,603
It was a real exchange.

603
00:57:14,177 --> 00:57:17,169
When it was all over,
Alejandro was called in,

604
00:57:17,247 --> 00:57:18,646
and he asked how it went.

605
00:57:18,715 --> 00:57:21,650
We answered that it went okay!

606
00:57:22,185 --> 00:57:24,244
That shows Alejandro's delicacy.

607
00:57:24,321 --> 00:57:29,588
There is no power-taking.
There is a real sense of giving.

608
00:57:29,659 --> 00:57:34,926
I am sure that when he was in
the house next door,

609
00:57:34,998 --> 00:57:40,231
he was probably reading a book...

610
00:57:40,303 --> 00:57:44,740
...praying for things to go well.

611
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:48,541
ButAlejandro is not superstitious.

612
00:57:48,612 --> 00:57:52,013
This is ''psycho-magic''.
I would call it modern medicine.

613
00:57:52,282 --> 00:57:54,978
It is a continuation of
my artistic work,

614
00:57:55,452 --> 00:57:59,513
and I don't see why an artist
shouldn't be interested in therapy.

615
00:57:59,589 --> 00:58:03,218
With the years, I realized that
all my problems,

616
00:58:03,293 --> 00:58:06,558
and all our problems,
originate from the way we were born.

617
00:58:07,564 --> 00:58:10,158
And the way we were born
depends on...

618
00:58:10,233 --> 00:58:13,100
...the relationship between
the father and the mother.

619
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:16,003
And the emotional relationship
between the father and the mother...

620
00:58:16,072 --> 00:58:19,166
...depends on the relationship
between the grandparents.

621
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:24,870
The grandparents' actions depend on
the great-grandparents' ideas,

622
00:58:24,948 --> 00:58:27,678
on religion, economy.

623
00:58:27,751 --> 00:58:31,243
In fact, all our ideas come from
our great-grandparents.

624
00:58:31,655 --> 00:58:35,091
I realized that we had
a family unconscious,

625
00:58:35,158 --> 00:58:36,887
we were a family tree.

626
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,761
I also realized that there were at
least 15 people thinking through me,

627
00:58:42,065 --> 00:58:43,965
my parents, my uncles and aunts,

628
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:46,366
my grandparents,
my great-grandparents,

629
00:58:46,436 --> 00:58:49,769
with all the family around--
I am a thinking family.

630
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:52,331
My illnesses are created
by my family.

631
00:58:52,409 --> 00:58:54,240
My behavior, the way I live,

632
00:58:54,311 --> 00:58:56,973
my conception of money,

633
00:58:57,047 --> 00:59:02,451
my emotional and sexual
relationships,

634
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:04,749
are all created by my family.

635
00:59:04,821 --> 00:59:11,556
Indeed, the psychological and
genetic field I come from...

636
00:59:11,628 --> 00:59:14,119
...marks my whole life.

637
00:59:14,197 --> 00:59:15,926
So, if I want
to understand myself,

638
00:59:15,999 --> 00:59:17,626
I have to understand
my family tree,

639
00:59:17,701 --> 00:59:22,638
because I am permanently possessed,
as in voodoo,

640
00:59:22,706 --> 00:59:25,436
by someone of my family.

641
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:32,509
How did you find that out?

642
00:59:32,582 --> 00:59:34,641
Little by little,
by reading the Tarot to people.

643
00:59:36,686 --> 00:59:39,450
Not intellectually.

644
00:59:39,956 --> 00:59:43,756
Progressively, by seeking the origin
of people's problems,

645
00:59:43,827 --> 00:59:47,957
I suddenly saw the complete
family tree in front of me.

646
00:59:48,398 --> 00:59:51,765
In his autobiography,jung speaks
about the family tree.

647
00:59:51,835 --> 00:59:54,235
It is the only tract I found
of somebody...

648
00:59:54,304 --> 00:59:58,263
...speaking about the family tree.

649
00:59:58,441 --> 01:00:00,807
I don't know if you know this text.

650
01:00:01,244 --> 01:00:03,007
- Shall I read it to you?
- Read it!

651
01:00:04,414 --> 01:00:06,974
'As I was working on my family tree,

652
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:09,245
I understood the strange communion
of destiny...

653
01:00:09,319 --> 01:00:11,150
...that linked me to my ancestors.

654
01:00:11,388 --> 01:00:13,879
I had the strong feeling that I was
under the influence...

655
01:00:13,957 --> 01:00:17,051
...of events and problems
left incomplete...

656
01:00:17,127 --> 01:00:19,027
...and unresolved by my parents,

657
01:00:19,095 --> 01:00:21,393
my grandparents,
and my other ancestors.

658
01:00:21,464 --> 01:00:23,432
It seems to me that often
in a family...

659
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:26,765
...there is an impersonal karma
transmitted from parents to children.

660
01:00:26,836 --> 01:00:29,964
I always thought that I had to
answer questions...

661
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,565
...already asked to my ancestors,

662
01:00:32,642 --> 01:00:38,103
or that I had to finish,
or just continue...

663
01:00:38,181 --> 01:00:42,379
...with problems
previously unsolved.''

664
01:00:42,452 --> 01:00:47,446
Yes,jung is absolutely right,
but he is timid.

665
01:00:47,524 --> 01:00:52,154
He has intuition,
he speaks about himself,

666
01:00:52,228 --> 01:00:56,324
but he has to apply what he says
to all mankind.

667
01:00:56,866 --> 01:00:59,699
We must take our problems in hand
and work on them.

668
01:01:00,036 --> 01:01:05,406
jung usually saw things,
but didn't go into them.

669
01:01:05,475 --> 01:01:09,912
I think the reason for this is the
lack of the masculine archetype.

670
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:13,211
There is no father
anywhere near him.

671
01:01:15,685 --> 01:01:19,121
Exploring the family tree means
engaging in a fierce battle...

672
01:01:19,189 --> 01:01:20,884
...with the monster, like a nightmare,

673
01:01:20,957 --> 01:01:24,120
so that the monster can give you
the treasure.

674
01:01:24,194 --> 01:01:31,464
The family tree is a real nightmare,

675
01:01:31,801 --> 01:01:37,034
where we find sadomasochism
everywhere,

676
01:01:37,207 --> 01:01:42,372
narcissism everywhere,
self-hatred everywhere.

677
01:01:42,645 --> 01:01:47,207
So, with this excrement that is
our family tree,

678
01:01:47,283 --> 01:01:50,116
we have to produce
the treasure gold.

679
01:01:53,723 --> 01:01:55,918
Have you any brothers?

680
01:01:59,129 --> 01:02:01,359
Yes, you who is filming me!

681
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:05,463
Do you have any problems?

682
01:02:05,535 --> 01:02:06,968
Like everybody.

683
01:02:07,037 --> 01:02:10,837
So you have problems.
Do you want to do it?

684
01:02:11,574 --> 01:02:15,374
As you are filming me,
now I am going to film you!

685
01:02:15,478 --> 01:02:17,878
- With pleasure.
- Yes?

686
01:02:17,947 --> 01:02:19,642
Are you sure
you want to do it?

687
01:02:19,716 --> 01:02:21,308
Do you want to work on
an emotional level?

688
01:02:21,384 --> 01:02:22,715
Yes, why not?

689
01:02:22,786 --> 01:02:27,485
Working with you on an emotional
level will be a total struggle.

690
01:02:28,925 --> 01:02:31,723
There, we will have a man
full of defenses,

691
01:02:31,795 --> 01:02:34,593
because he is filming somebody
else's life and not his own.

692
01:02:34,664 --> 01:02:38,862
Now you are going to be
the lead actor in your movie! Okay?

693
01:02:38,935 --> 01:02:41,267
That is my longtime dream.

694
01:02:41,905 --> 01:02:43,600
- What is your first name?
- Louis.

695
01:02:44,074 --> 01:02:47,339
Place three cards
without turning them over.

696
01:02:55,518 --> 01:02:59,147
I think everybody should do that.

697
01:02:59,522 --> 01:03:02,423
Otherwise we will never
understand ourselves.

698
01:03:03,226 --> 01:03:05,592
One thinks one is an individual.

699
01:03:05,662 --> 01:03:09,723
But, even when we cut ties
with our family,

700
01:03:09,799 --> 01:03:12,859
we carry it, that's the problem.

701
01:03:12,936 --> 01:03:15,905
In 1953, I cut ties with my family,

702
01:03:15,972 --> 01:03:17,564
and that remained
for all my life.

703
01:03:17,941 --> 01:03:20,205
My mother is dead.

704
01:03:21,744 --> 01:03:24,008
I had a terrible relationship
with her.

705
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:29,245
She had many problems with my
father, and she never caressed me.

706
01:03:29,986 --> 01:03:33,319
So I didn't have a mother
who touched me.

707
01:03:34,023 --> 01:03:39,928
So when I was 23, I left Chile and
threw my address book in the sea.

708
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:43,394
I never called my father
or my mother.

709
01:03:43,466 --> 01:03:46,196
It was over forever.

710
01:03:48,471 --> 01:03:52,032
When I was 50, I had a dream.

711
01:03:54,677 --> 01:03:57,202
I saw my mother lying in a sofa
telling me:

712
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,976
''Alejandro, I'm dying.''

713
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:02,448
So I told her that,
since she was dying,

714
01:04:02,519 --> 01:04:05,113
we had to solve all our problems.

715
01:04:05,188 --> 01:04:07,713
She explained
why she hadn't touched me,

716
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:10,384
and I explained what I felt.

717
01:04:10,493 --> 01:04:13,428
I told her that, after all,

718
01:04:13,496 --> 01:04:16,863
the mother is an important person
in one's life.

719
01:04:17,467 --> 01:04:21,597
We spoke
and we sealed the wounds...

720
01:04:21,804 --> 01:04:23,669
When I woke up, I told my wife:

721
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:29,770
'' Listen, my mother is dying.
I am going to send a letter...

722
01:04:29,846 --> 01:04:35,307
...to my sister who lives with her
to be read to my mother.''

723
01:04:35,385 --> 01:04:37,546
So I summarized the dream,

724
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:40,020
spoke about her values
and wrote to my sister:

725
01:04:40,089 --> 01:04:42,819
''I send you this letter.
If it arrives too late,

726
01:04:42,892 --> 01:04:45,019
read it in front of mother's grave.''

727
01:04:45,094 --> 01:04:48,461
The letter arrived
one day after her death.

728
01:04:49,232 --> 01:04:51,894
It was true that she was dying.

729
01:04:54,037 --> 01:05:00,203
Then I realized
that in our unconscious...

730
01:05:00,276 --> 01:05:04,042
...the persons are always alive.

731
01:05:04,547 --> 01:05:07,277
The dead live with us...

732
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:09,809
Let's see a tree in action.

733
01:05:10,653 --> 01:05:14,680
Don't think. Look and let yourself
be guided by your unconscious.

734
01:05:14,757 --> 01:05:17,658
Look around and say:
''This is my father!''

735
01:05:28,071 --> 01:05:32,269
Moebius. That's what comes to me.

736
01:05:33,009 --> 01:05:34,340
Your father!

737
01:05:36,045 --> 01:05:37,706
With or without shoes?

738
01:05:38,081 --> 01:05:39,878
As he is.

739
01:05:39,949 --> 01:05:42,383
Your mother?

740
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,649
Madam?

741
01:05:47,357 --> 01:05:49,018
Are you sure?

742
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:50,821
I have chosen.

743
01:05:50,893 --> 01:05:52,190
You are chosen. Don't be shy.

744
01:05:52,262 --> 01:05:53,991
Do you like the way she is dressed?

745
01:05:54,063 --> 01:05:56,031
Very much.

746
01:05:57,133 --> 01:05:58,794
Your father and your mother.

747
01:06:12,115 --> 01:06:14,879
I would see the father
a bit in retreat,

748
01:06:14,951 --> 01:06:18,978
and the mother in front,
but not too much.

749
01:06:25,762 --> 01:06:28,287
Okay. Where do you place yourself?

750
01:06:31,467 --> 01:06:34,265
- Spontaneously, here.
- Okay, that's understood.

751
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:41,142
You had problems
when you were born.

752
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:45,306
You must see clearly
the circumstances of your birth.

753
01:06:46,115 --> 01:06:49,175
- You mean my physical birth?
- Yes, your physical birth.

754
01:06:49,252 --> 01:06:52,050
I was born prematurely
by caesarian operation.

755
01:06:52,455 --> 01:06:54,480
That's the problem at birth.

756
01:06:54,557 --> 01:06:56,991
And the only son.

757
01:06:58,761 --> 01:07:00,956
Move the mother there,
so she can have room...

758
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:04,363
Who is the mother of your mother?

759
01:07:04,934 --> 01:07:08,199
You in the audience do it
in your head. That's how we work!

760
01:07:08,271 --> 01:07:11,604
The lady in the red jacket.

761
01:07:13,376 --> 01:07:14,638
The mother of your mother.

762
01:07:14,711 --> 01:07:18,613
Was there any important brother
or sister in your mother's family?

763
01:07:18,681 --> 01:07:25,610
There were four sisters and
a brother that seems important to me...

764
01:07:25,688 --> 01:07:29,852
...as he died in a hunting accident.

765
01:07:29,926 --> 01:07:31,655
How old was he when he died?

766
01:07:31,728 --> 01:07:33,628
I think he was 16.

767
01:07:33,696 --> 01:07:35,186
That's important.

768
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:37,664
What seems important to me is that...

769
01:07:37,734 --> 01:07:40,703
...he had the same Christian name
as my father.

770
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:43,739
His name was Gian-Carlo:
my father's was Charles.

771
01:07:43,806 --> 01:07:46,240
As if by chance!

772
01:07:46,309 --> 01:07:48,174
Bring the brother and I will
immediately explain...

773
01:07:48,244 --> 01:07:50,144
...what this is all about.

774
01:07:50,213 --> 01:07:56,209
For me this is common. The name
implies a series of meanings.

775
01:07:56,285 --> 01:07:58,753
Where is the boy?

776
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:04,687
Where do you see him?

777
01:08:05,194 --> 01:08:09,358
You, with the pink scarf.

778
01:08:11,768 --> 01:08:13,531
He died in a hunting accident.

779
01:08:13,603 --> 01:08:15,366
Who killed him?

780
01:08:18,741 --> 01:08:23,440
I think that my grandfather
provoked the accident.

781
01:08:23,513 --> 01:08:25,743
A bullet by ricochet.

782
01:08:25,815 --> 01:08:28,978
He is the one who killed him.

783
01:08:31,854 --> 01:08:33,321
Unconsciously.

784
01:08:33,823 --> 01:08:39,853
In this family,
whom did your mother admire?

785
01:08:39,929 --> 01:08:42,762
- Her father.
- The father is very important.

786
01:08:42,832 --> 01:08:46,393
We should put him up on a chair,
but we cannot.

787
01:08:49,872 --> 01:08:54,138
He forms a couple with the daughter.

788
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:58,271
And the mother,
where do you place her?

789
01:09:04,387 --> 01:09:06,321
I would place her on the other side.

790
01:09:10,893 --> 01:09:14,226
Somewhere there, a bit behind,
maybe.just like that!

791
01:09:14,297 --> 01:09:17,323
What is the role of the boy?

792
01:09:19,869 --> 01:09:22,667
I would place him there.

793
01:09:23,139 --> 01:09:24,936
In place of your father?

794
01:09:27,176 --> 01:09:29,838
He has the same name
as your father!

795
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:36,382
Strange isn't it?
That's your mother's family.

796
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:38,950
Your father's now.

797
01:09:47,363 --> 01:09:52,062
You see we are just beginning
to scratch the surface.

798
01:09:52,134 --> 01:09:54,659
In the beginning
we don't see anything,

799
01:09:54,737 --> 01:09:58,571
so we have to scratch more.

800
01:09:59,509 --> 01:10:01,170
You, if you please.

801
01:10:01,244 --> 01:10:04,304
Your dad's mom.

802
01:10:06,415 --> 01:10:11,443
Please come, madam, and thank you
for your participation.

803
01:10:11,587 --> 01:10:13,748
Where are you going to place her?

804
01:10:13,823 --> 01:10:14,812
Here.

805
01:10:14,891 --> 01:10:17,291
He is very close to his mother.

806
01:10:18,294 --> 01:10:20,285
- Quite.
- Very important.

807
01:10:20,363 --> 01:10:22,627
And your dad's dad?

808
01:10:23,065 --> 01:10:25,226
You, with the red shirt.

809
01:10:25,301 --> 01:10:27,861
Do you want to participate?
Okay, come.

810
01:10:28,504 --> 01:10:30,301
Where are you going to place
this father?

811
01:10:30,373 --> 01:10:34,434
I would place him just behind
my father, so he's not seen.

812
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:36,501
Because, although he has exactly
the same name as me,

813
01:10:36,579 --> 01:10:40,379
Louis Mouchet, I never saw him,

814
01:10:40,449 --> 01:10:43,213
- I was never told anything about him.
- Is he erased?

815
01:10:43,286 --> 01:10:45,948
Totally erased.
So I would place him behind.

816
01:10:46,022 --> 01:10:48,354
This one is not in the dark.

817
01:10:48,424 --> 01:10:50,449
This one is more present.

818
01:10:50,526 --> 01:10:51,788
My mother used to speak a lot
about him.

819
01:10:51,861 --> 01:10:54,056
Is mother in the background?

820
01:10:56,599 --> 01:10:58,692
No, not at all.

821
01:10:59,368 --> 01:11:02,531
But she worships her father.

822
01:11:03,673 --> 01:11:05,265
And her mother, is she erased?

823
01:11:05,341 --> 01:11:07,366
Her mother is less present,

824
01:11:07,443 --> 01:11:10,742
but not as absent
as my father's father.

825
01:11:12,648 --> 01:11:15,116
Sit down to let the audience see.

826
01:11:15,885 --> 01:11:17,785
There is a nucleus
that we are going to see.

827
01:11:17,853 --> 01:11:20,344
Right? A family secret.

828
01:11:21,023 --> 01:11:23,491
We have here, according to what
he insinuated,

829
01:11:23,559 --> 01:11:30,226
an accident, a semi-murder,
as his own father killed him.

830
01:11:30,967 --> 01:11:35,529
That almost reaches the dimension
of Greek tragedy.

831
01:11:36,105 --> 01:11:40,701
Here, he is
close to a strong mother,

832
01:11:42,111 --> 01:11:47,378
as your mom relates more
to her father.

833
01:11:53,889 --> 01:11:56,687
Mother has a masculine archetype
injected into her.

834
01:11:58,794 --> 01:12:04,061
Dad has a female archetype in him.

835
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:07,760
That means that things are crossed.

836
01:12:09,639 --> 01:12:15,202
He bears the woman in him,
she bears the man in her.

837
01:12:16,212 --> 01:12:20,239
According to what you said,
I am going to interpret, slowly.

838
01:12:21,951 --> 01:12:24,112
You are absolutely right.
My father said it textually:

839
01:12:24,186 --> 01:12:27,417
''I am the feminine man, and you
are the masculine woman.''

840
01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:31,950
He said it in a letter to my mother.

841
01:12:32,028 --> 01:12:34,121
His father said:

842
01:12:34,196 --> 01:12:37,632
''I am the feminine man and you
are the masculine woman.''

843
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,531
It was already said in the family.

844
01:12:39,635 --> 01:12:42,001
This archetypal male provider...

845
01:12:42,071 --> 01:12:44,835
provider of subsistence...

846
01:12:44,907 --> 01:12:49,844
provider of material means...

847
01:12:49,912 --> 01:12:51,880
it looks like you never knew.

848
01:12:51,947 --> 01:12:55,940
Tell us how they die.
How did your father die?

849
01:12:56,018 --> 01:12:57,246
Throat cancer.

850
01:12:57,953 --> 01:13:02,219
You realize that there is
an emotional nucleus hidden here.

851
01:13:03,159 --> 01:13:09,098
That means that your father
didn't express his emotions.

852
01:13:09,165 --> 01:13:10,393
I say that at the risk of making
an enormous mistake.

853
01:13:10,466 --> 01:13:13,264
They were two. My uncle died
from exactly the same illness.

854
01:13:13,335 --> 01:13:14,768
His brother?

855
01:13:15,438 --> 01:13:17,429
They were born on the same day.

856
01:13:17,506 --> 01:13:19,667
Was he older or younger?

857
01:13:20,076 --> 01:13:22,476
Younger.

858
01:13:22,545 --> 01:13:24,809
He imitated his brother.

859
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:30,512
That means that the two formed
a couple.

860
01:13:30,586 --> 01:13:33,054
Because there were no adults
to take care of them.

861
01:13:35,224 --> 01:13:38,955
It is a progression.

862
01:13:39,028 --> 01:13:42,122
That's why you are making
this film on me.

863
01:13:42,198 --> 01:13:46,897
You are profoundly seeking
the paternal archetype.

864
01:13:46,969 --> 01:13:48,800
That's why I tell you
that the father is absent.

865
01:13:48,871 --> 01:13:51,237
I say that because you move
from the real father...

866
01:13:51,307 --> 01:13:53,673
...to the spiritual one
and the spiritual father...

867
01:13:53,743 --> 01:13:55,438
...to the mythical one.

868
01:13:55,511 --> 01:13:57,376
They are the symbols of the father.

869
01:13:57,446 --> 01:13:59,437
The Emperor, the Pope,
and the Sun are all symbols,

870
01:13:59,515 --> 01:14:01,244
which grow in amplitude.

871
01:14:01,784 --> 01:14:04,810
Herein lies an emotional knot
which is not expressed.

872
01:14:05,121 --> 01:14:07,646
Because of this, as a man,

873
01:14:07,723 --> 01:14:14,060
he'll have problems
expressing his emotions.

874
01:14:15,164 --> 01:14:17,428
That's your heritage!

875
01:14:18,801 --> 01:14:21,269
I'll cope with that!

876
01:14:24,907 --> 01:14:28,035
How old were you
when your father passed away?

877
01:14:28,110 --> 01:14:30,203
I was 22.

878
01:14:30,379 --> 01:14:33,780
What did you feel at that moment?
Was everything said?

879
01:14:33,849 --> 01:14:36,647
Or did things remain unsaid?

880
01:14:37,453 --> 01:14:41,412
The first thing that comes to me
about my father's death?

881
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:44,050
Well, he had cancer;

882
01:14:44,126 --> 01:14:47,960
a long and painful illness,
and he suffered a lot.

883
01:14:48,097 --> 01:14:50,725
How old were you
when he began to suffer?

884
01:14:52,635 --> 01:14:56,071
When it was diagnosed
I was 21 .

885
01:14:56,138 --> 01:14:57,765
Then it lasted for a year.

886
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:03,369
But I think that his pain began
before the illness broke out.

887
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:08,072
And what is
even more striking...

888
01:15:08,150 --> 01:15:09,708
...about the moment of death
is that,

889
01:15:09,785 --> 01:15:12,310
suddenly I saw an expression
of peace on his face...

890
01:15:12,388 --> 01:15:16,586
...that I had never seen before
in my life.

891
01:15:16,659 --> 01:15:20,220
All of a sudden there was peace
and ecstasy on his face...

892
01:15:20,296 --> 01:15:21,456
that I had never seen.

893
01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:23,088
- Yes.
- It was the moment of death.

894
01:15:23,165 --> 01:15:24,655
Unbelievable.

895
01:15:24,733 --> 01:15:27,725
It is beautiful because it
softens the death.

896
01:15:27,870 --> 01:15:30,998
But it is unbelievable
to be on this planet...

897
01:15:31,073 --> 01:15:33,633
...and choose a father
that never showed...

898
01:15:33,709 --> 01:15:35,609
...a peaceful face
in all your life.

899
01:15:35,678 --> 01:15:37,646
You have to see him dead
to understand...

900
01:15:37,713 --> 01:15:39,146
...that he is in peace.

901
01:15:39,215 --> 01:15:41,080
For him, life was--

902
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:43,710
It was enormous suffering.

903
01:15:44,353 --> 01:15:45,820
Living is suffering.

904
01:15:47,556 --> 01:15:51,617
He is the son of a father
who transmits to him...

905
01:15:51,694 --> 01:15:54,356
...that life is great suffering.

906
01:15:54,530 --> 01:15:57,260
That's the first thing
to be clarified.

907
01:15:59,401 --> 01:16:02,234
What was your father's profession?

908
01:16:02,605 --> 01:16:05,267
His vocation was a poet.

909
01:16:05,341 --> 01:16:09,175
So he was an artist.
That's why you chose Moebius.

910
01:16:10,613 --> 01:16:12,808
But poets don't make
a lot of money.

911
01:16:12,882 --> 01:16:16,875
To live, he had
a private school.

912
01:16:16,952 --> 01:16:18,977
He was a teacher and had
his own school...

913
01:16:20,623 --> 01:16:23,751
...equivalent to the beginning
of college level.

914
01:16:23,826 --> 01:16:26,386
For children?

915
01:16:26,462 --> 01:16:30,398
Not young children.
Teenagers.

916
01:16:30,466 --> 01:16:32,764
And he taught literature?

917
01:16:32,835 --> 01:16:37,636
He managed the school and
taught literature and Latin.

918
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:40,267
But above all he wanted
to be a poet?

919
01:16:40,342 --> 01:16:42,776
He is a poet. His work exists.

920
01:16:44,413 --> 01:16:47,712
Do you like his work?
Was he a good poet?

921
01:16:48,017 --> 01:16:52,078
Huh-- In the beginning,
I had trouble liking it.

922
01:16:52,154 --> 01:16:58,150
I couldn't read it like
poems of Baudelaire...

923
01:16:58,227 --> 01:16:59,660
...or Rimbaud.

924
01:16:59,728 --> 01:17:02,026
I had tremendous difficulty
in the beginning.

925
01:17:02,097 --> 01:17:03,860
Why was it so difficult?

926
01:17:03,933 --> 01:17:06,333
Because of all this.

927
01:17:08,437 --> 01:17:11,565
Because he didn't
communicate with you.

928
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:19,046
He was like a lone traveler,
in poetry.

929
01:17:20,282 --> 01:17:22,113
Yes, that might be
the explanation.

930
01:17:22,184 --> 01:17:27,554
I had the feeling that
in his poetry lies...

931
01:17:27,623 --> 01:17:29,853
...what he couldn't
communicate to me.

932
01:17:29,925 --> 01:17:34,521
And, as a result, I didn't
want to love his poeticwork.

933
01:17:34,596 --> 01:17:36,393
Did you go to his school?

934
01:17:36,465 --> 01:17:42,461
I went to do my homework,
after school.

935
01:17:42,538 --> 01:17:45,063
So he was not with you.

936
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:48,075
No, he wasn't with me.

937
01:17:48,143 --> 01:17:52,671
He didn't have an affectionate
relationship with me.

938
01:17:52,982 --> 01:17:54,609
- Being an only child--
- Except that from time to time--

939
01:17:54,683 --> 01:17:56,742
As the only child,
strange, isn't it?

940
01:17:56,819 --> 01:17:58,286
- That's strange.
- Wait. Wait.

941
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:01,116
- That's strange.
- Often--

942
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:02,350
It could be worse.

943
01:18:02,491 --> 01:18:07,793
Often the only relationship
he had with me...

944
01:18:07,863 --> 01:18:11,355
...was giving lessons
or checking my homework.

945
01:18:11,433 --> 01:18:13,094
Nothing affective.

946
01:18:13,168 --> 01:18:16,968
Or, when he was
completely drunk,

947
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:20,531
we would go to the cafes
to fool around.

948
01:18:20,609 --> 01:18:23,772
Alcohol! He was closed.

949
01:18:23,846 --> 01:18:26,974
He couldn't express
his emotions.

950
01:18:27,783 --> 01:18:31,014
Take your father by the hands
and speak to him.

951
01:18:33,122 --> 01:18:34,783
Ask him what was missing.

952
01:18:34,857 --> 01:18:37,417
Face him.
What was missing?

953
01:18:39,361 --> 01:18:41,386
Speak to him directly!

954
01:18:41,563 --> 01:18:43,394
To accomplish totally--

955
01:18:43,465 --> 01:18:46,366
No, no, speak to him,
he's your father.

956
01:18:46,902 --> 01:18:49,928
I would say. To accomplish
totally your poeticwork.

957
01:18:51,573 --> 01:18:55,031
And, speaking of myself,
to love me totally,

958
01:18:56,879 --> 01:18:59,609
to express the love that...

959
01:18:59,681 --> 01:19:03,549
...I'm sure you did feel
for me deep inside.

960
01:19:04,186 --> 01:19:05,517
I couldn't speak to you
directly,

961
01:19:05,587 --> 01:19:08,181
that's why I used poetry.

962
01:19:11,627 --> 01:19:12,958
So I will read your poetry...

963
01:19:13,028 --> 01:19:14,859
...and try to understand
your message.

964
01:19:14,930 --> 01:19:19,060
- Didn't you read his poetry?
- Yes, but poetry is mysterious.

965
01:19:19,802 --> 01:19:23,135
Maybe I didn't understand
his message.

966
01:19:23,205 --> 01:19:26,333
You have to read my poetry
as being addressed to you.

967
01:19:26,408 --> 01:19:28,103
Okay.

968
01:19:28,911 --> 01:19:31,106
Wait! Wait!

969
01:19:40,989 --> 01:19:43,457
No, no, you must protest.

970
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,289
If I were you,
I wouldn't accept that.

971
01:19:46,361 --> 01:19:48,659
But I don't want to protest,

972
01:19:48,730 --> 01:19:51,631
I accept what you are
telling me.

973
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:52,826
I have to help you.

974
01:19:52,901 --> 01:19:54,300
I am speaking to the father.

975
01:19:54,369 --> 01:19:57,736
I know,
but I have to help you.

976
01:19:57,806 --> 01:20:03,244
In this case poetry
is his rival,

977
01:20:04,546 --> 01:20:08,915
because his father gives
all his passion to poetry,

978
01:20:08,984 --> 01:20:10,747
not to him.

979
01:20:10,819 --> 01:20:13,447
Wait, wait, wait.

980
01:20:13,522 --> 01:20:15,922
You risk finding yourself
with an alien woman...

981
01:20:15,991 --> 01:20:18,289
...who is going to give all
her love to singing,

982
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:21,261
not to you, and you are
going to love her...

983
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:25,767
...because she is totally
dedicated to her art.

984
01:20:26,235 --> 01:20:28,066
And you will follow her,

985
01:20:28,137 --> 01:20:31,368
like you followed your father,
who was dedicated to his art.

986
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:35,132
Art is the rival for you.

987
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:38,668
I am doing something
extremely magical for you.

988
01:20:38,847 --> 01:20:41,281
You followed me with my work,

989
01:20:41,383 --> 01:20:46,150
but suddenly I come out
of the work and I am facing you.

990
01:20:46,321 --> 01:20:50,621
- That's revolutionary in your life.
- That's right.

991
01:20:50,692 --> 01:20:53,252
This is the first time that
the father, the artist,

992
01:20:53,328 --> 01:20:56,695
the poet is facing you
and cares about you.

993
01:20:56,765 --> 01:21:00,565
I do not care about myself.
I am not mimicking for the camera.

994
01:21:00,802 --> 01:21:04,966
You are important.

995
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:10,979
Ask your father to care
about you, besides poetry.

996
01:21:11,046 --> 01:21:13,514
When will somebody care
about you?

997
01:21:13,749 --> 01:21:16,513
How long are you going to be
a public person?

998
01:21:16,585 --> 01:21:20,077
When are you going
to be yourself?

999
01:21:20,155 --> 01:21:24,182
When will somebody look at you
as a human being?

1000
01:21:25,394 --> 01:21:27,021
What I want to say
to my father is:

1001
01:21:27,095 --> 01:21:30,826
why did you need poetry?

1002
01:21:30,899 --> 01:21:33,424
Why didn't you
talk to me directly?

1003
01:21:33,569 --> 01:21:36,299
A form of autism.

1004
01:21:37,539 --> 01:21:39,666
By talking directly to me,

1005
01:21:39,741 --> 01:21:41,003
I think you could have
overcome that.

1006
01:21:41,076 --> 01:21:45,240
Express yourself.
Now is the time!

1007
01:21:46,014 --> 01:21:47,743
I am sorry.

1008
01:21:48,016 --> 01:21:50,541
Regrets are useless.

1009
01:21:52,087 --> 01:21:54,783
Now he begins
to express himself!.

1010
01:21:54,856 --> 01:21:57,450
Regrets are of no use.

1011
01:21:59,761 --> 01:22:02,696
That's what he never did!

1012
01:22:09,471 --> 01:22:12,804
I would take a book
of my father's and burn it.

1013
01:22:12,874 --> 01:22:14,569
Keeping one, of course.

1014
01:22:14,643 --> 01:22:17,908
But I would take one copy
and burn it.

1015
01:22:18,247 --> 01:22:20,875
That's what I'd do
as a psycho-magic act.

1016
01:22:20,949 --> 01:22:27,047
Because that is my rival,
that's enough!

1017
01:22:27,122 --> 01:22:30,990
This way I'll be able
to release my anger.

1018
01:23:19,107 --> 01:23:21,075
In all this lies a quest
for love.

1019
01:23:21,143 --> 01:23:23,771
We ask the father why,
what was missing...

1020
01:23:23,845 --> 01:23:25,904
...and when we join the father,

1021
01:23:25,981 --> 01:23:28,006
we find that it is
a need for love.

1022
01:23:28,083 --> 01:23:30,278
All our anger against
our family...

1023
01:23:30,352 --> 01:23:33,446
...lies in misplaced
and unsatisfied love.

1024
01:23:33,522 --> 01:23:35,319
But when we reach this state...

1025
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:36,687
...where we can express
ourselves and communicate,

1026
01:23:36,758 --> 01:23:38,419
everything vanishes.

1027
01:23:39,194 --> 01:23:43,221
The tree couldn't bear fruit because
the productive passage was clogged.

1028
01:23:43,298 --> 01:23:45,664
Now the tree can grow.

1029
01:23:45,734 --> 01:23:51,172
There is no prejudice...

1030
01:23:51,239 --> 01:23:53,707
... no childishness.

1031
01:23:53,775 --> 01:23:55,766
We all become mature,

1032
01:23:55,844 --> 01:23:58,677
artists accomplish themselves,

1033
01:23:58,747 --> 01:24:02,877
money comes, and the fear
of money vanishes.

1034
01:24:07,789 --> 01:24:10,053
Thank you!
