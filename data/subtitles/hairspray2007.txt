00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,028
* Oh, oh, oh *

3
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,792
* Woke up today *

4
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,265
* Feeling the way *

5
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,461
* I always do *

6
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,197
* Oh, oh, oh *

7
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:47,536
* Hungry for something
that I can't eat *

8
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,337
* Then I hear that beat *

9
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:53,106
* That rhythm of town
starts calling me down *

10
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:57,139
* It's like a message from high above *

11
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,616
* Oh, oh, oh *

12
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:02,985
* Pulling me out to the smiles
and the streets that I love *

13
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:06,150
- Good morning, Baltimore!
- * Good morning, Baltimore *

14
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:09,457
* Every day's like an open door *

15
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:13,159
* Every night is a fantasy *

16
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,135
* Every sound's like a symphony *

17
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,833
* Good morning, Baltimore *

18
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:24,037
* And someday when I take to the floor *

19
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:27,706
* The world's gonna wake up and see *

20
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:31,183
* Baltimore and me *

21
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,891
* Oh, oh, oh *

22
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,555
* Look at my hair *

23
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:47,657
* What 'do can compare
with mine today? *

24
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,099
* Oh, oh, oh *

25
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:52,536
* I've got my hairspray and radio *

26
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,335
* I'm ready to go *

27
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,308
* The rats on the street *

28
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,969
* All dance around my feet *

29
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:02,141
* They seem to say:
"Tracy, it's up to you" *

30
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,844
* So oh, oh, don't hold me back *

31
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,785
* 'Cause today all
my dreams will come true *

32
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,187
* Good morning, Baltimore *

33
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:14,751
* There's the flasher
who lives next door *

34
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:18,161
* There's the bum on 
his barroom stool *

35
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:22,362
* They wish me luck
on my way to school *

36
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:25,371
* Good morning, Baltimore *

37
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,533
* And someday when I take to the floor *

38
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:32,705
* The world's gonna wake up and see *

39
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,339
* Baltimore and me *

40
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,575
* I know every step *

41
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,314
* I know every song *

42
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:45,347
* I know there's a 
place where I belong *

43
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,417
* I see all those party lights
shining ahead *

44
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:52,591
* So someone invite me
before I drop dead *

45
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,623
* Before she drops dead *

46
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,636
* So oh, oh, give me a chance *

47
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,663
* 'Cause when I start
to dance I'm a movie star *

48
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,175
* Oh, oh, oh *

49
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,440
* Something inside
of me makes me move *

50
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,413
* When I hear that groove *

51
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,211
* My ma tells me no *

52
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,150
* But my feet tell me "go" *

53
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:16,451
* It's like a drummer inside my heart *

54
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,422
* So oh, oh, don't make me wait *

55
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:32,564
* One more moment for my life to start *

56
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,166
* I love you, Baltimore *

57
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,701
* Every day's like an open door *

58
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:43,147
* Every night is a fantasy *

59
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:46,913
* Every sound's like a symphony *

60
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,320
* And I promise, Baltimore *

61
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:53,484
* That someday when I take to the floor *

62
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:57,860
* The world's gonna wake up and see *

63
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:01,424
* Gonna wake up and see *

64
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,628
* Baltimore and me *

65
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,137
* Yes, more or less, we all agree *

66
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,105
* Baltimore and me *

67
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,732
* Someday the world is gonna see *

68
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:17,240
* Baltimore and me *

69
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:26,085
Mount Everest is the most
famous, but not the highest...

70
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,355
geographical point on this earth.

71
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,885
Now, who can tell me what that is?

72
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,125
Um, excuse me, Miss Whimsy?

73
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,531
I can't see the board again.

74
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,866
Tracy Turnblad.

75
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,371
If I have to write you up...

76
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:42,431
for inappropriate hair height
one more time...

77
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,443
you will be removed to detention.

78
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,877
Miss Wimsey, what am I supposed to do?

79
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:50,041
Hair can't just hang there like a dead thing
on your cheeks.

80
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,678
I mean, well... Uh... you know what I mean.

81
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,154
I... Ahh.

82
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:01,252
As I said, it is not Mount Everest.

83
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:04,058
Now, next week we will be talking...

84
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,032
about earthquakes and volcanoes.

85
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,193
And as exciting as that might sound...

86
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:13,331
we have to look back approximately
60 million years.

87
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,840
Now, if you turn your pages...

88
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,865
we are going to start
with the Ring of Fire.

89
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,877
I want you to contemplate what causes...

90
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,243
the separation of the two components.

91
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,752
Penny, come on, hurry!

92
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,528
Outta my way!

93
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:41,861
Push! We're late.

94
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,241
Ahh!

95
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,738
- One minute to air.
- OK.

96
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,419
40 to go!

97
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,254
Don't change that channel.

98
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,658
Coming up next: <i>The Corny Collins Show.</i>

99
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:09,820
30 seconds.

100
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,263
- Hiya, Dad!
- Goodbye!

101
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:21,603
Hi.

102
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:22,630
It's my daughter.

103
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,644
10 seconds. Places, everyone.

104
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,280
Hurry up, Penny, we're missing it!

105
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,839
My mom says I'm not
allowed to perspire!

106
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:36,114
Hey there, teenage Baltimore!

107
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,282
Don't change that
channel 'cause it's time...

108
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,792
for <i>The Corny Collins Show...</i>

109
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,762
Brought to you by Ultra Clutch hairspray.

110
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,493
* Oh, every afternoon when
the clock strikes four *

111
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,001
* Bop bee ba ba ba ba ba ba bee ba *

112
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:53,528
* Well, a crazy bunch of kids crash
through that door, yeah *

113
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,768
* Bop bee ba ba ba ba ba ba bee ba *

114
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,900
* Well, they throw off their coats *

115
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,604
* And leave the squares behind *

116
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,838
* And then they shake it,
shake it, shake it *

117
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,176
* Like they're losin' their mind *

118
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,476
* You'll never see them frown *

119
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,813
* 'Cause they're the
nicest kids in town *

120
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,978
* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh *

121
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,317
* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh *

122
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:13,018
* Oh, every afternoon
you turn your TV on, huh *

123
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,686
* Naa na na na na na na na *

124
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,661
* Yeah, we know you
turn the sound up *

125
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,630
* When your parents
are gone, yeah *

126
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,791
* Naa na na na na na na na *

127
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,893
* Then you twist and shout
for your favorite star *

128
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,096
* And when you've
practiced every step *

129
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,627
* That's in your repertoire *

130
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,037
* You better come on down *

131
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:31,339
* And meet the nicest kids in town *

132
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:32,639
Whoo!

133
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,146
* Nice white kids
who like to lead the way *

134
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,309
* And once a month
we have our Negro Day *

135
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,819
* And I'm the man who
keeps it spinnin' round *

136
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,879
* Mr. Corny Collins
with the latest greatest *

137
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:47,882
* Baltimore sound *

138
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:51,226
* So, every afternoon drop everything *

139
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,356
Whoo!

140
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,365
* Bop bee ba ba ba ba ba ba bee ba *

141
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,764
* Who needs to read and write *

142
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,268
* When you can dance and sing, yeah! *

143
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,168
* Bop bee ba ba ba ba ba ba bee ba *

144
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,833
* Forget about your
algebra and calculus *

145
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,775
* You can always do your homework
on the mornin' bus *

146
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,038
* Can't tell a verb from a noun *

147
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,512
* They're the nicest kids in town *

148
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,038
* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh *

Tammy.

153
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,056
Fender.

154
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,057

And I'm... Link.

163
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,632
Aah!

164
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,637
* So, if every night you're shakin' *

165
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,730
* As you lie in bed *

166
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:34,740
* Mony, mony *

167
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,105
* Shake it, baby *

168
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:39,236
* And the bass and drums
are poundin' in your head *

169
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,439
* Mony, mony, ooh, mony, mony *

170
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,278
* Who cares about sleep when
you can snooze in school *

171
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,150
* You'll never get to college
but you'll sure look cool *

172
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:48,915
* Don't need a cap or a gown *

173
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,981
* When you're the nicest kids in town *

174
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,584
They must think my ears
are garbage cans.

175
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:58,256
Would you turn that racket down?

176
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,162
I'm tryin' to iron here.

177
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,928
* Nicest kids in *

178
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,230
* Kids in town, whoo! *

179
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,608
Ma, it's not racket.
It's <i>The Corny Collins Show.</i>

180
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,509
Well, it's turning your brains into mud.

181
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,571
Mrs. Turnblad, it's a new dance!

182
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,014
The Stricken Chicken.

183
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,108
Well, I can't hear myself think.

184
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,915
How am I supposed to negotiate pleats?

185
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:22,921
Edna?

186
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,650
I'm in here, Prudy.

187
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,920
What's that racket?

188
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,291
Ohh, Tracy.

189
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,795
Edna, is my laundry ready?

190
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,457
Yep.

191
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,432
That'll be $3.00, hon.

192
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,958
That's pretty pricey
for a pair of petty pants.

193
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,027
Well, I'm sorry, Prudy...

194
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,503
but some-a your personal stains...

195
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,665
required poundin' with a rock.

196
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,107
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

197
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,810
You're letting her listen
to that race music again?

198
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,646
My daughter spends every afternoon
at the Stamp and Coin Club.

199
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,982
Oh, really? Well, your daughter hap...

200
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,817
Ohh, ohh.

201
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,449
Oh, what is that? The Wavin' Raven?

202
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,356
It's a little twitchy.

203
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,761
Oh, you wanna play Charades now.
All right.

204
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,321
OK, go ahead.

205
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,662
You.

206
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,724
Penny.

207
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,327
No. Ahh!

208
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:15,067
Tracy Turnblad, are you tryin' to tell me...

209
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,301
that... that Penny didn't get permission...

210
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,673
from her mother to be here?

211
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,836
What?

212
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,072
Penny.

213
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:23,013
You are banned from this house.

214
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,983
You will never watch that show again!

215
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,544
- Without that show I have nothing!
- Having nothing builds character!

216
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,079
Toodle-oo, Edna!

217
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:41,892
Give 'em a hand, folks.
All right, all right.

218
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,970
And, once again,
that's the Stricken Chicken.

219
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:50,134
We will be right back
for some more of that hot Detroit sound.

220
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,676
And we're off!

221
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,237
Corny.

222
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:58,181
"Detroit sound"?

223
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,481
What's that, the cries
of people being mugged?

224
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,453
Aw, Velma, the kids dig
the rhythm and blues.

225
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:03,887
Yeah, they're kids, Corny.

226
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,551
That's why we have to steer
them in the white direction.

227
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:07,581
Right direction?

228
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:10,251
Didn't I say that?

229
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,935
I'll do it.

230
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,244
You try that again and there'll be stumps
where your feet should be.

231
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:27,802
You got that? You little whor...

232
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,041
Amber.

233
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,413
...holy moly. Baby.

234
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,849
Good job dancing today.

235
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,819
- It's time.
- Ah!

236
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:35,821
Link.

237
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:36,822
Amber.

238
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,084
Ah!

239
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,285
- Amber.
- Amber, Amber, Amber.

240
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,720
Save your personal life
for the cameras, sweetie.

241
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,628
Oh! Shiny.

242
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,627
Tammy, Lou Ann,
you're gonna die.

243
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,828
Speaking of cameras,
did you have a nice nap?

244
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,771
If you'd do your job, my daughter wouldn't
have to fight to be visible.

245
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,240
I gotta show some of the
other kids once in a while.

246
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,709
You know, this is a small city.

247
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,302
There aren't that many stations.

248
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,177
This time next year
you could be wearing...

249
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,842
an ill-fitting tux,
snapping bar mitzvah photos.

250
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,312
I don't know.

251
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:12,786
* It takes two, baby... *

252
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,293
Show Link.

253
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,659
This is nuts. She can't even dance.

254
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,687
Plastic little spastic.

255
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:23,634
Oh, Link. I can dance
so much better than her.

256
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,796
Why don't you notice me at school?

257
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:26,930
Mm-hmm.

258
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,166
* Ooh *

259
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:36,543
Hey, that was our very own Link Larkin
singin' <i>It Takes Two.</i>

260
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,675
And I'm Motormouth Maybelle remindin'...

261
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,743
the last Tuesday of this month's
your rhythm and blues day.

262
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:44,483
That's right! Negro Day
will be comin' your way.

263
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:48,823
So don't... uh... Uh... Over here.

264
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,294
Thank you.

265
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,890
So, catch all the croonin'
when y'all set and tune in.

266
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,423
Thank you, Motormouth.
And now it's time to...

267
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,162
Owner's coming. He'll call
my mother again, let's go.

268
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,170
...very own fun-lovin'...

269
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,501
Hey!

270
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:00,527
Come on up here, Brenda.

271
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:01,870
What?

272
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,340
Brenda will be taking a leave of absence
from the show.

273
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,842
How long you gonna be gone, Brenda?

274
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,538
Just nine months.

275
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,139
Seems like we'll have an opening
here on the show for a girl...

276
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,582
just as fun-lovin' but maybe
not quite as freewheelin'.

277
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,848
Wanna be one-a
the nicest kids in town?

278
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:18,084
Cut school tomorrow and come down
to station <i>WYZT</i> to audition.

279
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,058
- No.
- But, Ma.

280
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,758
Don't test me, Tracy Turnblad.

281
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,266
My diet pill's wearin' off.

282
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,029
But come on.

283
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,867
No one is auditioning for
anything in this household.

284
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,930
But why not? Why not?!

285
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,566
Because dancing is not your future.

286
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:40,545
One day you're gonna own
Edna's Occidental Laundry.

287
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,513
I don't wanna be a laundress.

288
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,776
I wanna be famous!

289
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,078
Look, if you wanna be famous...

290
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,778
learn how to take blood
outta car upholstery.

291
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,810
That's a skill you can take right to the bank.

292
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:51,482
- Hey, hey. What's all this ruckus in here?
- Not a word.

293
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:54,390
Daddy, tomorrow I'm auditioning
to dance on a TV show.

294
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:55,586
- No, she is not.
- You are?

295
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,289
First the hair, now this?

296
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,354
But all the kids are battin' up
their hair now, hon.

297
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,422
You're no help.

298
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,558
It's "ratting," Daddy.

299
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,397
And our first lady,
Jacqueline Kennedy, does it.

300
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:04,493
I don't believe that.

301
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:05,560
What do you mean,
you don't believe that?!

302
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,731
- I don't.
- How else would it look that way?

303
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:09,638
I believe that it is naturally stiff.

304
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,508
She doesn't understand anything.

305
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:15,342
- Dancing on that show is my dream.
- I know.

306
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,646
Just because she wouldn't know
a dream if it bit her on the nose.

307
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,549
Well, I have information for you, missy.

308
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:24,044
I once had a dream that I owned
a coin-operated laundromat...

309
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,149
and I came down from that cloud
real quickly, I'll tell you that.

310
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,454
No!

311
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,088
- Oh, Wilbur.
- Fine! I'm going to my room!

312
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,893
She thinks I'm bein' mean
but I'm not. Those TV people...

313
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:37,426
they don't pick people like Tracy,
or girls like us.

314
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:39,460
They're gonna hurt her, Wilbur.

315
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,099
I'll talk to her.

316
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,574
Ooh.

317
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,305
'K. Talk to her.

318
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,908
I'll talk to her.

319
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,313
Don't you worry.

320
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,407
OK.

321
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,145
What?

322
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,985
Tracy, this TV thing.

323
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,789
You really want it?

324
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:03,817
With all my heart.

325
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,352
Then you go for it!

326
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,855
This is America, babe.

327
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,595
You gotta think big to be big.

328
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,798
Big ain't the problem
in this family, Wilbur.

329
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:15,466
You follow your dream.

330
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:19,967
Mine came true, and now I have the most
precious thing in the world.

331
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,507
The Taj Mahal of joke shops.

332
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,483
Heh heh heh heh!

333
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,485
Heh heh heh heh!

334
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,613
Back step, cha-cha-cha.

335
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,317
Side step, front step.

336
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,326
Back and turn.

337
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,123
Front step, cha-cha-cha.

338
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,788
Tammy, sharper.

339
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,695
Side step, front step.

340
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,529
Back, again.

341
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,626
Oh, my God, Penny, there's Link.

342
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,159
Link!

343
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,501
Penny, pinch me!

344
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,506
Ow!

345
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,837
You told me to.

346
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,173
I can't believe I'm really here auditioning.

347
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,701
Side step, front step.

348
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,577
I can't believe I'm really
here watching you audition.

349
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,479
Front step, cha-cha-cha.

350
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,313
Back step, cha-cha-cha.

351
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,285
Side step, front step.

352
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,416
Back and t... oh, Amber.
Look at this motley crew.

353
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,687
Oh! This town sure has gone downhill...

354
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,125
since I was crowned
Miss Baltimore Crabs.

355
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,185
Ugh.

356
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:13,562
* Oh, my God,
how times have changed *

357
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,262
* These girls must be blind
or completely deranged *

358
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,031
* But time seemed to halt *

359
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,199
* When I was Miss Baltimore Crabs *

360
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,936
Amber, that move is far too dirty.

361
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,240
Mother, wake up from
that dream of yours.

362
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,246
- This isn't 1930.
- Ha ha ha.

363
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,272
* You can laugh but life's a test *

364
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,045
* Don't do this, don't do that *

365
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,916
* Remember, Mother knows best *

366
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,853
* For the crown's in the vault *

367
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,586
* From when I won Miss Baltimore Crabs *

368
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:41,923
* These steps are perfect ammunition *

369
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,726
* Let me show you how your mommy
dear took out the competition *

370
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:48,198
Girls, go get 'em.

371
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,461
Boys, let's rumba.

372
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:53,028
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

373
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,530
* Those poor runner-ups might
still hold some grudges *

374
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:00,272
* They padded their cups
but I screwed the judges *

375
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,906
* Those broads thought
they'd win if a plate *

376
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,246
* They would spin in their dance *

377
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,251
Aah!

378
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:09,254
* Not a chance
Boys, put me down *

379
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,222
Oh, good morning, ladies.

380
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,621
Let's see what you got.

381
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:16,594
* Twist, twist, twist, twist
mashed potato, mambo *

382
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:17,822
* Ready, begin *

383
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,728
* On my show you'll never find *

384
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,426
* A thrusting hip or bump and grind *

385
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,298
* What's that?
A dance for fleas and ticks? *

386
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,200
* Oh, you should-a seen my bag of tricks *

387
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:29,037
* Oh, I hit the stage batons ablaze *

388
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:32,237
* While belting <i>AÏda</i>
and preparing soufflés *

389
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,336
* But that triple somersault *

390
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:39,646
* Is how I clinched
Miss Baltimore Crabs *

391
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,305
Proceed.

392
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:09,837
* Are you scared we're on live? *

393
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,679
* No, I'm sure I can cope *

394
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,311
* Well, this show isn't broadcast in *

395
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,547
* Cinemascope *

396
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,350
* I never drank one chocolate malt *

397
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:22,326
* No desserts for Miss Baltimore Crabs *

398
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,022
* This one will never get a date *

399
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:26,053
* In those hand-me-down clothes *

400
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:30,057
* Ha! Kid, she'll never get a date
till Daddy buys her a new nose *

401
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,399
* I would say <i>"Oy, gevalt"</i> *

402
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:34,837
* If I wasn't Miss Baltimore Crabs *

403
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,308
* Do you dance like you dress? *

404
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,402
* Amber, there's no need to be cruel *

405
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:43,744
* Would you swim
in an integrated pool? *

406
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:44,840
I sure would.

407
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,350
I'm all for integration.

408
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,410
It's the new frontier!

409
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,284
Not in Baltimore, it isn't.

410
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,846
And may I be frank?

411
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,051
* First impressions can be tough *

412
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:55,650
* And when I saw you, I knew it *

413
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,161
* If your size weren't enough *

414
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,096
* Your last answer just blew it *

415
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:02,931
* And so, my dear,
so short and stout *

416
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,526
* You'll never be in *

417
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,765
* So we're kicking you out *

418
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,238
* With your form and your face *

419
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,104
* Aw, well, it isn't your fault *

420
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,507
* You're just down with a case *

421
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:19,882
* Of Miss Baltimore Crabs *

422
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,079
Uh, you may go.

423
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,918
Um... Thank you?

424
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,724
I think they secretly liked you.

425
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,806
Cutting my class, Tracy Turnblad?

426
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:48,904
I trust it was something really important.

427
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:50,437
It should've been.

428
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,348
* Gimme a break, yeah.
Right now! *

429
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,954
* Got a brand-new sound,
so scream and shout *

430
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,191
Hey! Hey!

431
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,495
* With a funky rhythm *

432
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,601
* It's a brand-new look that you can... *

433
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,298
Whoo!

434
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:17,269
* There's a party groovin'
let's get down *

435
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,276
What you lookin' at?

436
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,744
Nothing. Not you.

437
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,081
Can I help you?

438
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,551
That move's swish.

439
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,213
Ya got that right.

440
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:31,245
The man can dine me
on a diet of detention...

441
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,758
so long as he don't starve
me of my tunes, baby.

442
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,556
- Does that dance have a name?
- Oh, this?

443
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,563
Call it the "Peyton Place After Midnight."

444
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:42,260
I use it to attract, uh, the opposite sex.

445
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,428
Wow.

446
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,131
That is so groovy.

447
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,945
You're really good.

448
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,969
Why, thank you.

449
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:59,677
So would it be kinda like this?

450
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:01,944
You can't do that dance.

451
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,477
Hello, now.

452
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:04,853
Not bad for a white chick.

453
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,024
- Hey, I know where I've seen you before.
- Where?

454
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,824
On Corny's show on Negro Day.

455
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:11,988
Negro Day's the best.

456
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,793
I wish every day were Negro Day.

457
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,426
At our house, it is.

458
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:21,199
Hey. Show me another one?

459
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:23,264
You wanna see another one.

460
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:26,038
Well... well, here's a little
something signified to say...

461
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,740
Hello, my name is Seaweed...

462
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,008
Oh, oh, oh!

463
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,709
J...

464
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,217
Stubbs.

465
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:34,445
What's yours, baby?

466
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:39,355
I'm Tra-cy Turn-blad!

467
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,360
You're gonna get it, white girl!

468
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,862
Well, Tracy, you got it goin' on, girl.

469
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,158
You one of us.

470
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:50,692
You're joinin' this program already
in progress!

471
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:52,203
Well, let's go.

472
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,205
* Whoo! *

473
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:56,207
* Yeah! *

474
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,573
* Got a brand-new sound,
so scream and shout *

475
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:03,711
* Hey, a funky beat,
now let's be hurrying *

476
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,216
Whoa!

477
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,013
* We can't wait now *

478
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,076
* Have some fun *

479
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,419
* This party now has just begun *

480
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,321
No, I get who Caesar is.

481
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:15,258
But what's the "Ideas of March"?

482
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:18,194
I mean, how can
a month have an idea?

483
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,356
Hold on.

484
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,763
Come on.

485
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:26,566
* Come on and watch me strut my stuff *

486
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,406
* Watch me *

487
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:30,567
* Come on and watch me *

488
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:31,974
How you likin' detention now?

489
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,946
I'm a bad, bad girl who
needs to be punished.

490
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,453
* Ohh *

491
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,250
Hey.

492
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:48,282
You know, Corny's hosting
the hop tomorrow.

493
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,027
If he saw you dancin' like that...

494
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,290
he'd put you on the show.

495
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,820
Mmm...

496
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,230
- See ya.
- Mm.

497
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,064
Ah, whoa. Sorry, little darlin'.

498
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,297
Hope I didn't dent your 'do.

499
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,303
See y'all later.

500
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:06,401
Hey, Trace. I was looking for you.

501
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,810
What?

502
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:11,440
* I can hear the bells *

503
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:14,008
What? What are you talking about?

504
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:17,488
* Well, don't-cha hear 'em chime? *

505
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,251
Chime's not exactly how I'd put it.

506
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:26,493
* Can't you feel my heartbeat
keeping perfect time? *

507
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:31,867
* And all because he *

508
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,165
* Touched me *

509
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,264
* He looked at me and stared *

510
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,434
* Yes, he bumped me *

511
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,467
* My heart was unprepared *

512
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,638
* When he tapped me *

513
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,705
* And knocked me off my feet *

514
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:47,980
* One little touch now my life's complete *

515
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:50,214
- * 'Cause when he nudged me *
- Oh!

516
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:52,382
* Love put me in a fix *

517
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,324
* Yes, it hit me *

518
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,384
* Just like a ton-a bricks *

519
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,953
* Yes, my heart burst *

520
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,056
* Now I know what life's about *

521
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:05,001
* One little touch and
love's knocked me out *

522
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:08,005
* And I can hear the bells *

523
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,870
* My head is spinning *

524
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,808
* I can hear the bells *

525
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,505
* Something's beginning *

526
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:18,073
* Everybody says that
a girl who looks like me *

527
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,050
* Can't win his love *

528
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,280
* Well, just wait and see *

529
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,187
* 'Cause I can hear the bells *

530
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:27,054
* Just hear them chiming *

531
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,889
* I can hear the bells *

532
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,487
* My temperature's climbing *

533
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,259
* I can't contain my joy *

534
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,459
* 'Cause I finally found the boy *

535
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,730
* I've been missin' *

536
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:44,675
* Listen, I can hear the bells *

537
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,108
* Round one *

538
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,612
* He'll ask me on a date and then *

539
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,512
* Round two *

540
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,881
* I'll primp but won't be late because *

541
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,510
* Round three *

542
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,714
* Is when we kiss inside his car *

543
00:25:56,755 --> 00:26:01,590
* Won't go all the way
but I'll go pretty fa-ar *

544
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,218
* Round four *

545
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:05,957
* He'll ask me for my hand and then *

546
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,897
* Round five *

547
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,265
* We'll book the wedding band so by *

548
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:11,701
* Round six *

549
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,432
* Amber, much to your surprise *

550
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:18,499
* This heavyweight
champion takes the prize *

551
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,807
* And I can hear the bells *

552
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,574
* My ears are ringing *

553
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,775
* I can hear the bells *

554
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:27,216
* The bridesmaids are singing *

555
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:31,120
* Everybody says that
a guy who's such a gem *

556
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,919
* Won't look my way *

557
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,392
* Well, the laugh's on them *

558
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,725
* 'Cause I can hear the bells *

559
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,957
* My father will smile *

560
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,693
* I can hear the bells *

561
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:44,133
* As he walks me down the aisle *

562
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,932
* My mother starts to cry *

563
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:50,533
* But I can't see 'cause Link
and I are French kissin' *

564
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:55,569
* Listen, I can hear the bells *

565
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:01,412
* Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh *

566
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,512
* I can hear the bells *

567
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,682
* My head is reeling *

568
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,624
* I can hear the bells *

569
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,991
* I can't stop the pealing *

570
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:14,055
* Everybody warns
that he won't like what he'll see *

571
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:18,559
* But I know that he'll
look inside of me *

572
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,662
* Yeah, I can hear the bells *

573
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:23,196
* Today's just the start 'cause *

574
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:24,606
* I can hear the bells *

575
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,441
* Until death do us part and *

576
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:31,040
* Even when we die
we'll look down from up above *

577
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:35,314
* Remembering the night
that we two fell in love *

578
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,344
* We both will shed a tear *

579
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:42,190
* And he'll whisper as we're reminiscin' *

580
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:45,856
* Listen, I can hear the bells *

581
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:47,865
* She can hear the bells *

582
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:50,959
* I can hear the bells *

583
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,835
* She can hear the bells *

584
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:59,674
* I can hear the bells *

585
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:05,377
* Bum, bum, bum *

586
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:15,051
* Whoa! *

587
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:18,392
* Hey, little girl with the cash to burn *

588
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,422
* Well, I'm sellin' somethin'
you won't return *

589
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:26,567
* Hey, little girl, take me off the shelf *

590
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:31,098
* 'Cause it's hard havin'
fun playin' with yourself *

591
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:33,133
* Once you bounce through
the whole selection *

592
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,146
* Shake those hips in my direction *

593
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,205
* Bringing back gifts
she never did see *

594
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,079
* Take me home and then unwrap me *

595
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:42,211
* Shop around but, little darlin',
I've got to be *

596
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:45,086
* The ladies' choice *

597
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:46,715
* Ladies' choice *

598
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:48,589
* The ladies' choice *

599
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,322
Go on. Get out there and show 'em.

600
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:53,955
It's packed pretty tight.

601
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:55,590
OK. I'll go in front of you and I'll push.

602
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,726
* Test drive this American male *

603
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,464
Wait.

604
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,836
* It's gonna take cash to fill my tank *

605
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:03,602
* It's gonna take cash to fill my tank *

606
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:05,575
* So let's crack open your piggy bank *

607
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,599
Hey, Seaweed!

608
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:08,077
Wanna do Peyton Place for Corny?

609
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:09,444
Are you crazy? You gotta
dance with your crowd...

610
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,573
and I gotta dance with mine.

611
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:11,673
Why?

612
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,047
It's just the way it is, Tracy.

613
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,381
But it's your dance.

614
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,011
Well, how 'bout you go
borrow it for a second.

615
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,215
- Really?
- Go get it, girl.

616
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,953
* I'm the ladies' choice *

617
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,756
* Ladies' choice *

618
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:26,127
* Ladies' choice *

619
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:29,163
Whoo!

620
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,164
All right! Yeah!

621
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:44,975
Whoa!

622
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:46,643
* Hey, little girl on a spendin' spree *

623
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,675
* I don't come cheap
but the kisses come free *

624
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,781
* On closer inspection
I'm sure that you'll agree *

625
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,985
* Oh, hey, little girl, listen to my plea *

626
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:57,290
* I come with a lifetime guarantee *

627
00:29:57,328 --> 00:30:00,422
* One day maybe we'll find
that baby makes three *

628
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,454
Link!

629
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:02,989
* It's the ladies' choice *

630
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:06,865
* I'm the ladies' choice *

631
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:10,570
* I'm the ladies' choice *

632
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:15,204
* I'm the ladies' choice-choice-choice *

633
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:17,407
* I'm the ladies' choice *

634
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:20,178
Mr. And Mrs. Turnblad!

635
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:23,714
Hey, look out!

636
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:24,722
Ah!

637
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,853
Mrs. Turnblad!

638
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,995
Mr. Turnblad, come quick!

639
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,360
- Me?
- Come on.

640
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,631
Mrs. Turnblad! Come quick!

641
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,033
You gotta see this!

642
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,297
Oh, I read all about it.

643
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,100
It's a big fake Hollywood set.

644
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,504
No, Mrs...

645
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,371
You think I'm gonna think
that he's really up there?

646
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,309
It's not John Glenn, Mrs. Turnblad!

647
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,743
Well, why are we watchin' this?

648
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:48,803
Just watch.

649
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:49,836
- Lou Ann!
- Joey!

650
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:50,848
Mikey! Vicki! Becky!

651
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:51,849
Bix! Jesse! Darla!

652
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,612
- Paulie!
- Noreen!

653
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:54,675
- Doreen!
- Link!

654
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:55,913
And I'm Tracy!

655
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:56,921
Aah!

656
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:59,048
Oh! Oh, my!

657
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,090
* Oh, yeah! *

658
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:05,220
* And the bass and drums
are poundin' in your head *

659
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:06,230
Go, Tracy!

660
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:07,595
- Go, go, Tracy!
- Go, go, Tracy!

661
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:10,362
* Who cares about sleep when
you can snooze in school? *

662
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:13,097
* You'll never get to college
but you sure look cool *

663
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:14,468
* Don't need a cap and a gown *

664
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:17,099
* When you're the nicest kids in town *

665
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,268
* Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo *

666
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,114
* Kids in town, woo! *

667
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,208
Yeah! That was the dance of the week...

668
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,311
I don't know what happened, Mr. Spritzer.

669
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:32,187
Corny had some sort
of aneurysm or something...

670
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,191
and... picked her.

671
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,921
...by our brand-new Council Member,
Miss Tracy Turnblad.

672
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:40,226
So, Trace, come on, cozy up to old Corny
and tell us about yourself.

673
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,563
Well, I watch <i>The Corny Collins Show...</i>

674
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,568
and I do absolutely nothing else!

675
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:46,229
Ooh! I sure like the way you talk.

676
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,432
Oh, Wilbur, to think that
I almost stopped her...

677
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:49,997
from reaching for the stars.

678
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:52,874
And now here she
is on local daytime TV.

679
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,640
She's gonna be a regular.

680
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:58,911
Imagine, my little girl, regular at last.

681
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,078
I also hope to be the first woman president
or a Rockette.

682
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,883
And if you were president, Tracy...

683
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,822
what would your first official act be?

684
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,586
Hmm.

685
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,820
I'd make every day Negro Day.

686
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,992
I read you like tomorrow's
headlines, Tracy.

687
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,090
What do you think, kids?

688
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,600
You think we might
have a hot new candidate...

689
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:17,828
for Miss Teenage Hairspray?

690
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,996
That's only the dream of my life.

691
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,733
But Miss Hairspray is mine.

692
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,240
Uh, we're on the air.

693
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,105
And your dream will be
comin' to you, sweetheart...

694
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:28,510
Saturday, June 2nd,
right here on <i>WYZT.</i>

695
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:31,242
You have to vote for a person, Corny,
not one of the Himalayas.

696
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,271
Hi, Penny.

697
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:33,648
Always the charmer, Amber.

698
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:38,811
I want that chubby communist
girl off the show.

699
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:41,347
Well, let me be the first
to toss the harpoon.

700
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:42,620
She's a corrupting influence!

701
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,289
I agree. We don't want our dancers
thrusting like savages!

702
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:47,730
Hey, speak for yourself.

703
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:48,959
Don't get flip with me.

704
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,331
I'm not.

705
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,131
Look, now I got some
new ideas for the show.

706
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,535
First, we get rid-a Negro Day.

707
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:55,801
Finally, some sense outta you.

708
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,535
And we mix those kids in
with the rest-a the Council.

709
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:59,042
Mix those kids?

710
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,101
That's right, I said it.

711
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,907
This is not a black-and-tan cocktail!

712
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:03,345
Well, why couldn't it be?

713
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,508
Velma, isn't this where
it's all headin' anyway?

714
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,314
Now, you can fight it
or you can rock out to it.

715
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:10,617
Maybe it is time for some fresh ideas...

716
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,681
like... like a nice, fresh new host!

717
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:15,817
Heh.

718
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,919
Gee, Velma,
how do you fire Corny Collins...

719
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:19,691
from <i>The Corny Collins Show?</i>

720
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:23,759
They do it all the time on <i>Lassie!</i>

721
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:25,826
Velma, you've let this go too far!

722
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:26,859
Me?

723
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:27,996
- Fix it!
- What?

724
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,165
Fix it!

725
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:31,764
Ohh!

726
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,741
* Hey, look out for that movin' van *

727
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,406
* Drivin' down our streets *

728
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,677
* You better lock up your man *

729
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:41,742
* Before he meets the new girl in town *

730
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:43,811
* Who just came on the scene... *

731
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,618
Tracyface whoopee cushion.

732
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:46,680
Good choice.

733
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,954
We got your Tracy souvenirs for days.

734
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:52,360
Here, your signed photos.

735
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:53,557
Tracy wigs.

736
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,156
* Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa *

737
00:33:55,199 --> 00:34:00,569
* We don't know what to do
'bout the new girl in town *

738
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,035
* The new girl in town *

739
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,940
* Seems to dance on air *

740
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,342
* The new girl in town *

741
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,778
* She's got the coolest hair *

742
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:14,877
* You better tell the homecoming queen
to hold onto her crown *

743
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,046
* Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa *

744
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,818
* Or she's gonna lose it to *

745
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,381
* The new girl in town *

746
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:24,395
That big little girl is sending
my sales through the roof.

747
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:27,557
More people are breathing
aerosol than oxygen!

748
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:29,225
Do you think you could show us
some of those new dance moves?

749
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,234
Yeah, sure.

750
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:31,235
Ooh, pretty flowers.

751
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,965
Tracy, wait up!

752
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,438
* She's hip *

753
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,907
* So cool *

754
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:41,742
* I'm gonna get her after school *

755
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:44,509
* And yet we'd like to be like her *

756
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:48,747
* 'Cause she's the kitten
that the cats prefer *

757
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,651
* The new girl in town *

758
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:52,451
* Has my guy on a string *

759
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,151
* The new girl in town *

760
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,251
* Hey, look, she's wearin' his ring *

761
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:59,752
* I can't stop cryin' and
so in my own tears *

762
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,731
* I'm gonna drown *

763
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,757
* Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa *

764
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:06,497
* 'Cause he wants to rendezvous *

765
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:07,731
* With the new girl *

766
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,831
* We're kinda sad and blue *

767
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:11,364
* Yes, it's true, girl *

768
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,434
* We'd like to say *

769
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:17,414
* To the new girl in town *

770
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,713
* The new girl in town *

771
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,584
Hi, I'm here to see Tracy Turnblad.

772
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:28,056
Where's her write-up?

773
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:30,652
She doesn't need a detention slip,
she's with me.

774
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:34,520
Penny, this is Seaweed.

775
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:35,532
Seaweed, this is Penny.

776
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:38,262
* Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa *

777
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,771
Huh.

778
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:50,647
* To the new girl in town *

779
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:53,912
* The new girl in town *

780
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:55,851
* Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa *

781
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:57,650
* From out of the blue, girl *

782
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,622
* Hey, this town's in a stew, girl *

783
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,557
* Ohh, what a hullabaloo, girl *

784
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:03,389
* She ain't just passing through, girl *

785
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:05,156
* Ohh, she's sticking like glue, girl *

786
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,720
* Woo, to the man
I thought I knew, girl *

787
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,493
* Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa *

788
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,467
* Hey, look out for that movin' van *

789
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,493
* Look out, look out,
look out, look out *

790
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:18,976
* She was the new girl in *

791
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,501
* Town *

792
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,378
That's the way you do it.

793
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:31,047
And I'm your fabled
Miss Motormouth Maybelle...

794
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:34,319
your DJ <i>du jour,</i>
pitchin' rhythm your way.

795
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,191
So, hey, better stay
and shimmy and sway.

796
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:39,753
We'll be right back with more Negro Day.

797
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:41,594
Brought to you by...

798
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:44,897
Nap-a-Way, for stubborn hair.

799
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:50,104
Every kink will be gone in a blink.

800
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,334
We're off.

801
00:36:58,583 --> 00:36:59,675
Girls, that was great.

802
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,845
How dare you pick the same song?

803
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,377
They wrote it.

804
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:05,684
You watch yourself.

805
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,453
You are one inch from being canceled.

806
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,551
You know what your demographic is?

807
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,722
Cleaning ladies and lawn jockeys.

808
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:22,068
A foot in the door, that's all it is.

809
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,835
One toe at a time.

810
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:28,572
Eh.

811
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:29,705
Hello?

812
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,443
Is this the Turnblad residence?

813
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:33,450
Yes.

814
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:35,611
Mr. Pinky speakin'.

815
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:38,952
Mr. Pinky from... from the dress shop?

816
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,218
Uh-huh.

817
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,555
I'd like Tracy
for our spokesgirl.

818
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,082
You want Tracy to do what?

819
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:44,094
Be our spokesgirl.

820
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:45,095
Be a spokesgirl?

821
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:48,292
I think she'd be perfect.
I'd like to meet her...

822
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:49,765
and discuss the details.

823
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,097
As soon as possible.

824
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:54,263
OK, um, well, we'll have send
someone down to meet you.

825
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:55,272
Tonight, if you can.

826
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:58,434
So, um, oh, OK.
Bye-bye, Mr. Pinky.

827
00:37:58,476 --> 00:37:59,443
Bye-bye.

828
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:00,501
The Mr. Pinky?

829
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:02,535
From Mr. Pinky's hefty hideaway!

830
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,604
A spokesgirl?!

831
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:06,981
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, tell me I get a free caftan, tell me!

832
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:10,112
Oh, Tracy, I think perks like
caftans have to be negotiated.

833
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:12,247
Maybe we should get you an agent.

834
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,281
OK. You be my agent.

835
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:16,293
What? Tracy Turnblad...

836
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:19,125
has fame gone to your head
and made you wacky?

837
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:20,289
Well, why not?

838
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:21,298
Who's goin' to look out for me...

839
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:22,321
better than my mom?

840
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:24,300
Me, an agent?

841
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:26,667
You see me hobnobbin'
and drinkin' rum and cokes...

842
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:28,331
with all those hoi pollois?

843
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:29,464
And out-negotiating them.

844
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:30,804
Oh, you're crazy.

845
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:35,275
Oh, Tracy, I haven't left
this house in... in years.

846
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,541
Then isn't it time you did?

847
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,138
Oh, no, Tracy.

848
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,241
We'll have your father meet with him.

849
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:42,809
L... I don't wanna be seen like this.

850
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:43,820
Why not?

851
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:46,118
I'll do it after my next diet.

852
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,647
That's when I'll do it.

853
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:50,160
Ya see, the neighbors haven't
seen me since I was a size 10.

854
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:51,627
Don't make me do it, Tracy.

855
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,995
Ma, it's changing out there.

856
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:56,329
You'll like it.

857
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,062
People who are different.

858
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,366
Their time is coming.

859
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:05,137
* Hey, Mama, hey, Mama, look around *

860
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,236
* Everybody's groovin'
to a brand-new sound *

861
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:11,214
* Hey, Mama, hey, Mama follow me *

862
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:14,046
* I know somethin's in ya
that you wanna set free *

863
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:17,020
* So let go, go, go of the past now *

864
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:20,046
* Say hello to the love in your heart *

865
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,924
* Yes, I know that
the world's spinning fast now *

866
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,224
* You gotta get yourself
a brand-new start *

867
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:28,060
* Hey, Mama, welcome to the sixties *

868
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,863
* Oh-o-o-o-o *

869
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:33,927
* Oh, Mama, welcome to the sixties *

870
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,997
* Oh-o-o-o-o *

871
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,942
* Go, Mama, go, go, go *

872
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:42,809
* Welcome to the sixties *

873
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:44,280
* Oh-o-o-o-o oh *

874
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:48,877
* Hey, Mama, yeah, yeah, yeah *

875
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:50,784
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

876
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:53,289
* Hey, Mama, hey, Mama, have some fun *

877
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:56,657
* I haven't left this house since 1951 *

878
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:59,185
* Hey, Mama, hey, Mama, take a chance *

879
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,427
* Oh, Tracy, it's been years
since someone asked me to dance *

880
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:05,196
* So let go, go, go of the past now *

881
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,399
* Say hello to the light in your eyes *

882
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:11,135
* Yes, I know that the world's
spinning fast now *

883
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,871
* But you gotta run
the race to win the prize *

884
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,209
* Hey, Mama, welcome to the sixties *

885
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,273
* Oh-o-o-o-o *

886
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:22,285
* Oh, Mama, welcome to the sixties *

887
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,311
* Oh-o-o-o-o *

888
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:28,018
* Go, Mama, go, go, go *

889
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:31,056
* Welcome to the sixties *

890
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,562
Ma, you did it!

891
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,427
Oh, Tracy, I'm a little lightheaded.

892
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:37,059
There's so much air out here.

893
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,228
Can't we go someplace that's stuffy?

894
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,295
No, Ma, you're on your way.

895
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,508
* Hey, Mama, welcome to the sixties *

896
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:49,775
* Oh-o-o-o-o *

897
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:52,612
* Oh, Mama, welcome to the sixties *

898
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,710
* Oh-o-o-o-o-o *

899
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:58,278
* Go, Mama, go, go, go *

900
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,517
Oh. They're so glamorous.

901
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:01,650
Wow.

902
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,456
It kicked.

903
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:06,622
Let's toast to that.

904
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:07,756
To a boy!

905
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,425
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

906
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,833
* Welcome to the rhythm
of a brand-new day *

907
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,700
* Take your old-fashioned fears *

908
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:15,295
* And just throw them away *

909
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:17,864
* You should add some color
and a fresh new 'do *

910
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:19,569
* 'Cause it's time for a star *

911
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,204
* Who looks just like you *

912
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:26,680
Ohh.

913
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,048
Ah!

914
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:30,212
Oh!

915
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:35,420
I thought we marked these down.

916
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:36,483
What?

917
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:38,653
Ohh.

918
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:44,066
Thank you, Nadine.

919
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,669
There's my shining star!

920
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,299
Fantastic to meet you!

921
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,832
I'm Mr. Pinky.

922
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:54,139
It's so nice to meet you.

923
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:58,740
Ha ha! Tracy, is this your older sister?

924
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:00,682
Oh, my.

925
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:03,687
Perhaps she'd like some
complimentary couture.

926
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:04,745
Couture?

927
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:07,518
Now, if you'll just sign here.

928
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:11,358
Flattery will not distract
Miss Turnblad's agent...

929
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:13,295
from reading the fine print.

930
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,059
Her agent?

931
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,192
Tracy, eat your donuts.

932
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:18,496
Let's talk.

933
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,525
Mm-hmm.

934
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,162
All right, let's see here.

935
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:23,662
All right. Now...

936
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:24,674
Mmm.

937
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:28,542
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. No!

938
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,945
I want a non-exclusive contract.

939
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:33,506
Extensions by mutual option.

940
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,917
And I want you to absorb
my 15 percent commission.

941
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:37,352
Not a dime over 10!

942
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,788
Throw in a bustier?

943
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,226
Hmm.

944
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,751
54 double D?

945
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:47,388
Triple E.

946
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:48,898
I hit the mother lode!

947
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:50,560
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

948
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,762
Care for a Baby Ruth?
I got one right here.

949
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:55,237
* Oh-o-o-o-o *

950
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:58,332
* Oh, Mama, welcome to the sixties *

951
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:01,503
* Oh-o-o-o-o *

952
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:04,105
* Go, Mama, go, go, go *

953
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,748
* Don't-cha let nobody
try to steal your fun *

954
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:11,846
* 'Cause a little touch of
lipstick never hurt no one *

955
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:14,722
* The future's got a million
roads for you to choose *

956
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:18,125
* But you'll walk a little taller
in some high-heeled shoes *

957
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:20,824
* And once you find the style
that makes you feel like you *

958
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:22,388
* Something fresh,
something new *

959
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,695
* Step on out, hear us shout *

960
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,793
* Mama, that's your cue *

961
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:31,464
* Ba da ba da-ba-da *

962
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,974
* Step on out, hear us shout *

963
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,108
* Mama, that's your cue *

964
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,584
* Hey, Tracy, hey, baby, look at me *

965
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,249
* I'm the cutest chickie
that you ever did see *

966
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,884
* Hey, Tracy, hey, baby, look at us *

967
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:51,793
* Where is there a team
that's half as fabulous *

968
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:54,525
* I let go, go, go of the past now *

969
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:57,625
* Said hello to this red carpet ride *

970
00:43:57,668 --> 00:44:00,796
* Yes, I know that the world's
spinning fast now *

971
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:03,102
* Tell Lollobrigida to step aside *

972
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,472
* Your Mama's welcoming the sixties *

973
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:08,501
* Oh-o-o-o-o *

974
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:11,639
* Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-baby *

975
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:14,617
* Oh-o-o-o-o *

976
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:18,315
* Go, Mama, go, go, go *

977
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:22,189
* Welcome to the sixties *

978
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:24,820
* Open the door to the girl who has more *

979
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:28,559
* She's a star, Tracy, go, go, go *

980
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:33,326
* Hey, Mama, welcome to the sixties *

981
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,564
* Your mama's hip, your mama's in *

982
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,368
* Hey, Mama *

983
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:38,807
* Your mama's lookin' at herself
and wonderin' "Where you been?" *

984
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,002
* Where you been? *

985
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,069
* Your mama's lit, she's all aglow *

986
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:43,773
* Your mama, what she's holdin' back *

987
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:45,475
* Your mama's gotta let go, go, go *

988
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,007
* Welcome to the "six", to the "O" *

989
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:52,682
* To the apostrophe "s"
hey-yay, baby, yeah *

990
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:53,883
* Oh-o-o-o-o *

991
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:01,729
* Oh, yeah *

992
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:03,926
* Go, Mama, go, go, go *

993
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:06,868
* Oh-o-o-o-o-o,
oh-o-o-o-o-o *

994
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:11,273
* Oh-o-o-o-o go,
go, Mama, go, go, go! *

995
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,210
Mmm. Mmm.

996
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:17,713
Wait till Dad sees you.

997
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:19,215
Sees me?

998
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:21,547
He never notices what I wear.

999
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:25,214
In 20 years, he's never even said to me,
"nice muumuu" or nothin'.

1000
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:26,552
Now he will.

1001
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:30,048
Well, maybe, if he leaves
that shop for 5 minutes.

1002
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:32,585
I swear, I don't know
what goes on down there.

1003
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:33,926
Well.

1004
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:37,092
Mrs. Turnblad.

1005
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:39,659
I'd know whose mother
you were anywhere.

1006
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:41,432
Really?

1007
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:42,598
Hello, Amber.

1008
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:44,368
Hello, Tracy.

1009
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,844
Ma, this is Amber and Mrs. Von Tussle.

1010
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:50,506
Mrs. Von Tussle is the station's manager.

1011
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:52,742
Oh, the station manager.

1012
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:56,378
Oh! Oh, it was so nice-a
you let her on that show.

1013
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,447
Well, Tracy certainly has...
redefined our standards. Ha ha!

1014
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:01,685
That's for sure.

1015
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:03,488
Let me guess...

1016
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:05,518
brand-new dress?

1017
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:06,961
Oh, yes.

1018
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:08,692
Well, you'll stop traffic.

1019
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,063
Ha ha ha.

1020
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:13,033
It was nice meeting you. Tracy.

1021
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,934
Bye, Tracy.

1022
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:20,404
Ugh.

1023
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,607
Ma, don't listen to a word she says!

1024
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:25,046
I'm takin' this back.

1025
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:26,106
Don't you dare.

1026
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,243
- I am.
- Don't you dare.

1027
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,843
Don't you know why she hates us?

1028
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,617
She's afraid I'll beat Amber
for Miss Teenage Hairspray.

1029
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:35,213
Really?

1030
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:37,693
They can't put Tracy in special ed.

1031
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:38,786
I won't have it.

1032
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:41,161
I mean, even if I have to tutor her myself...

1033
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:42,893
they cannot hold my friend back.

1034
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:44,798
- You're a saint.
- Mm.

1035
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:48,271
Oh, and it's totally not true about her
and the entire football team.

1036
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,602
I mean, please.

1037
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,666
Anybody can get grass stains
all over their back.

1038
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,134
Amber, stop it.

1039
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:56,578
I'm sick-a you doin' that.

1040
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:58,342
Just because she's a good dancer.

1041
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:00,179
Uh! I'm sorry.

1042
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:02,082
You think that she can dance?

1043
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,280
Well, maybe you'd rather
have her as your partner.

1044
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,118
You could get sponsored by Goodyear.

1045
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:09,683
Excuse me. What is
going on back there?

1046
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:13,790
Tracy, that's horrible.

1047
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,664
Mr. Flak does not have breasts.

1048
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,863
What? No. I would... I would never.

1049
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:21,495
What... Oh.

1050
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:37,253
Oh, and Mr. Larkin,
perhaps you'd like to share...

1051
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:40,882
with the rest of the class Patrick Henry's
immortal last words.

1052
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:43,524
"Kiss my ass"?

1053
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:55,234
You didn't have to do that, Link.

1054
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:56,569
Hey, no prob.

1055
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:59,508
Besides, looks like
a cool scene down here.

1056
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,840
Right.

1057
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,869
Hey, cool.

1058
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,039
Hey, Tracy!

1059
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,012
Not quite, huh?

1060
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,255
Ah, damn. Just when I was gettin' it.

1061
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:17,760
Listen, man,
you ain't gotta stop now.

1062
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:19,819
My mom's havin' a platter party tonight.

1063
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:21,160
Y'all wanna come check it out?

1064
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:22,859
Now?!

1065
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,061
Would you mind if I, too, checked it out?

1066
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:27,070
I've never been to North Avenue before.

1067
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:28,696
Uh, well, would it be safe?

1068
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,331
You know, for us?

1069
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:32,535
Calm down, cracker boy.

1070
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,543
It's cool.

1071
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,703
Wow.

1072
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,770
Being invited places by colored people!

1073
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:38,474
It feels so hip!

1074
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:42,451
I'm glad y'all feel that way
'cause, uh, not many people do.

1075
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:44,750
- Y'all know what I'm sayin'?
- Yeah, that's right.

1076
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:47,154
* Hey! *

1077
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,886
* I can't see why people look at me *

1078
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,725
* And only see the color of my face *

1079
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:56,392
* Ah, yeah, then there's those that try
to help, God knows *

1080
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:59,732
* But always have to put me in my place *

1081
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,739
* But I won't ask you to be color-blind *

1082
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:06,140
* 'Cause if you pick the fruit then, girl,
you're sure to find *

1083
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:09,543
* The blacker the berry,
the sweeter the juice *

1084
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:12,605
* I could say it ain't so but, darlin',
what's the use? *

1085
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:15,777
* The darker the chocolate,
the richer the taste *

1086
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:17,912
* And that's where it's at *

1087
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,321
* Now, baby, run and tell that *

1088
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:21,688
* Now run and tell that *

1089
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:23,215
* Run and tell that *

1090
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,591
* Run and tell that *

1091
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,925
* Hey, yeah! *

1092
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,261
* I can't see why people disagree *

1093
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:32,098
* Each time I tell 'em what
I know is true, oh, no *

1094
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,102
* And if you come *

1095
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,070
* And see the world I'm from *

1096
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:38,632
* I bet your heart is
gonna feel it, too, yeah *

1097
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:41,542
* I could lie but, baby, let's be bold *

1098
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:42,977
* Vanilla can be nice *

1099
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:44,981
* But if the truth be told *

1100
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:47,609
* Blacker the berry,
the sweeter the juice *

1101
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:50,882
* I could say it ain't so but, darlin',
what's the use? *

1102
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:54,152
* The darker the chocolate,
the richer the taste *

1103
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:56,022
* And that's where it's at *

1104
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:58,357
* Oh, baby, baby, run and tell that *

1105
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:00,090
* Run and tell that *

1106
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,620
* Go run and tell that *

1107
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,962
* Run and tell that *

1108
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,968
* Come on and run and tell that *

1109
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,128
* Run and tell that *

1110
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,636
* Hey, run and tell *

1111
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,865
* Go tell *

1112
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:11,169
* Run and tell that *

1113
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:14,811
Link!

1114
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,403
Link Larkin!

1115
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:20,645
* Hey, yeah! *

1116
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:24,347
* Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah *

1117
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:25,480
- Whoo!
- Hey!

1118
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:26,614
Whoo!

1119
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:29,787
* Whoo! *

1120
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:31,384
Come here, girl.

1121
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:33,362
This is my sister, Little Inez.

1122
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:35,024
Oh, I know Tracy Turnblad.

1123
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:36,760
Good for you, girl.
You got on the show.

1124
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,529
- Well, you better be next.
- Ya got that right.

1125
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:40,661
Oh, you know she is.
You better show 'em, girl.

1126
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,331
Yeah!

1127
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:45,671
* I'm tired of coverin' up all my pride *

1128
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,405
* So give me five on the black hand side *

1129
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:52,108
* I got a new way of movin'
and I got my own voice *

1130
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:54,879
* So how can I help but
to shout and rejoice *

1131
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:58,581
* Oh, the people 'round here
can barely pay their rent *

1132
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:01,648
* They try to make a dollar
outta fifteen cent *

1133
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:04,785
* But we got a spirit
money just can't buy *

1134
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:09,322
* It's deep as a river
and soars to the sky, to the sky! *

1135
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:12,767
* Hey, I can't see the reason it can't be *

1136
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:14,896
* The kinda world where
we all get our chance *

1137
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:15,962
* Aw, yeah *

1138
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:17,303
* The time is now *

1139
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,900
* So we can show 'em how
just turn the music up *

1140
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:22,309
* And let's all dance, yeah, yeah *

1141
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:25,610
* 'Cause all things are equal
when it comes to love *

1142
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:28,743
* Well, that ain't quite true
'cause when push comes to shove *

1143
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:31,754
* The blacker the berry,
the sweeter the juice *

1144
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:35,451
* They say it ain't so but, darlin',
what's the use? *

1145
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:38,359
* The darker the chocolate,
the richer the taste *

1146
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:39,862
* And that's where it's at *

1147
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:42,490
* Now, baby, baby, baby,
run and tell that *

1148
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:44,295
* Run and tell that *

1149
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:45,699
* Run and tell that *

1150
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:47,100
* Ah yeah, baby*
* Run and tell that *

1151
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:49,037
* Go run and tell that *

1152
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:55,341
* G-g-g-g-go home
and run and tell that *

1153
00:51:55,378 --> 00:52:02,443
* Yeah, yeah *

1154
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:09,756
* Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah *

1155
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,590
* Whoo! *

1156
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:14,426
- Go, baby!
- Whoo!

1157
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:17,856
It was horrible.

1158
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:19,994
Mom, he just danced on that bus...

1159
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:21,560
with that great white whale
and those negroes.

1160
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:22,867
No, honey.

1161
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:25,807
Reeling him back in is
the easiest thing in the world.

1162
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:28,276
Remember, I control his career.

1163
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:31,314
Ohh.

1164
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:33,009
Now, don't worry.

1165
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:35,017
Mommy will take care of everything.

1166
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:02,641
Are you all hungry
for some good fun?

1167
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:05,436
* Yeah *

1168
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:09,941
* Bring on that pecan pie *

1169
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:14,821
* Pour some sugar on it,
sugar, don't be shy *

1170
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:19,818
* Scoop me up a mess
of that chocolate swirl *

1171
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:23,697
* Don't be stingy,
I'm a growin' girl *

1172
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:29,194
* I offer big love with no apology *

1173
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:33,573
* How can I deny
the world the most of me? *

1174
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:38,377
* I am not afraid
to throw my weight around *

1175
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:42,044
* Pound by pound by pound *

1176
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:47,819
* Because I'm big,
blonde and beautiful *

1177
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:52,453
* Face the fact,
it's simply irrefutable *

1178
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:56,829
* No one wants a meal
that only offers the least *

1179
00:53:56,866 --> 00:54:00,768
* When, girl, we're servin'
up the whole damn feast *

1180
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:06,568
Well, looks like y'all
took a step outta bounds.

1181
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:07,634
Now, who we got here?

1182
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:09,611
Mom, I want you to meet my new friends.

1183
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:12,240
This here is Link. Tracy Turnblad.

1184
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:15,547
This is just so afro-tastic!

1185
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,382
And this young lady right here...

1186
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,320
is Penny Pingleton.

1187
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:23,417
I'm very pleased
and scared to be here.

1188
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:27,920
Oh, now, honey. We got more reason
to be scared on your street.

1189
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:29,829
Latoya, put that record down.

1190
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:31,094
You gonna scratch it.

1191
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:32,101
Can't you keep your little girl...

1192
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:33,102
Shall we dance?

1193
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:34,330
Come on.

1194
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,129
My name is Mike.

1195
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:38,265
Mike?

1196
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:40,003
Yes, Mike.

1197
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:41,101
Mike who?

1198
00:54:41,144 --> 00:54:42,270
It's Mike.

1199
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:44,280
Anyway, ahem...

1200
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:46,214
I'm calling because
I have some information...

1201
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:47,910
about your daughter's whereabouts.

1202
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,714
- What?
- Right now, as we speak...

1203
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:53,280
your daughter has entered
a hotbed of moral...

1204
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,188
turpentine.

1205
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:57,693
* Baby don't sleep *

1206
00:54:57,727 --> 00:54:59,854
* Baby don't eat *

1207
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:04,799
* Baby just like another boink-boink *

1208
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:07,735
Link, aren't you gonna get
in awful trouble for this?

1209
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:09,568
I'm not plannin' on tellin' my dad.

1210
00:55:09,606 --> 00:55:12,074
No, I mean in trouble
with someone else.

1211
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:14,804
Hmm. Maybe.

1212
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:16,812
Maybe it's worth it.

1213
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:20,111
I think knowin' you's the start
of a pretty big adventure.

1214
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,139
Ahh!

1215
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:25,681
Tracy Edna Turnblad!

1216
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:28,949
Ooh, we get any more
white people in here...

1217
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,482
this gonna be a suburb.

1218
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:34,762
Do you know what I had to pay a cab...

1219
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:36,265
just to consider comin' down here?

1220
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:37,789
Oh, uh, Mom...

1221
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,995
No call. You just disappear.

1222
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:42,504
And all mashed up against a crooner?

1223
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:45,997
Um, Edna Turnblad, this is Link.

1224
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:48,837
Come on, we're goin'.

1225
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:51,312
And, Penny, go home before
your mother shoots you.

1226
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,542
Miss Edna, is it?

1227
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:54,846
Hi, I mean, you don't
have to rush off, you know.

1228
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:57,045
Well, I do. I left my iron on.

1229
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:58,748
Oh, your iron.

1230
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:00,119
Well, before you go...

1231
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:01,817
you sure you
wouldn't like to have...

1232
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,520
a little somethin' to eat?

1233
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:06,722
Mmm-mmm.

1234
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:16,400
Is that braised?

1235
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:18,498
* Whoa oh oh oh oh oh *

1236
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,702
* Whoa oh oh oh oh oh *

1237
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:24,475
* Slice me off a piece
of that hogshead cheese *

1238
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:25,503
* Whoo! *

1239
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,776
* And take a look inside *

1240
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:29,649
* My book of recipes *

1241
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:34,453
* Now, don't-cha sniff around
for somethin' fluffy and light *

1242
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:39,121
* We need a man who brings
a man-size appetite *

1243
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:44,293
* We'll use a pinch-a sugar
and a dash-a spice *

1244
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:48,862
* I'll let you lick the spoon
because it tastes so nice *

1245
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:53,035
* We keep it in the oven
till it's good and hot *

1246
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:57,376
* Keep on stirrin' till it hits the spot *

1247
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:02,852
* Because I'm big,
blonde and beautiful *

1248
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:07,550
* There is nothin' 'bout us
that's unsuitable *

1249
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:11,492
* Why sit in the bleachers
timid and afraid *

1250
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:16,397
* When, Edna, you look
like the whole parade? *

1251
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:19,402
* They say that white
has might and thin is in *

1252
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,960
* Well, that's just bull *

1253
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:22,938
* 'Cause, ladies, big is back *

1254
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:26,271
* And as for black, it's beautiful *

1255
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:28,174
* All shapes and sizes follow me *

1256
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:35,447
* Who wants a twig when
you can climb a whole tree *

1257
00:57:36,305 --> 00:57:42,227
