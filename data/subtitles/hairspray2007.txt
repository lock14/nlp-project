* Oh, oh, oh *
* Woke up today *
* Feeling the way *
* I always do *
* Oh, oh, oh *
* Hungry for something
that I can't eat *
* Then I hear that beat *
* That rhythm of town
starts calling me down *
* It's like a message from high above *
* Oh, oh, oh *
* Pulling me out to the smiles
and the streets that I love *
- Good morning, Baltimore!
- * Good morning, Baltimore *
* Every day's like an open door *
* Every night is a fantasy *
* Every sound's like a symphony *
* Good morning, Baltimore *
* And someday when I take to the floor *
* The world's gonna wake up and see *
* Baltimore and me *
* Oh, oh, oh *
* Look at my hair *
* What 'do can compare
with mine today? *
* Oh, oh, oh *
* I've got my hairspray and radio *
* I'm ready to go *
* The rats on the street *
* All dance around my feet *
* They seem to say:
"Tracy, it's up to you" *
* So oh, oh, don't hold me back *
* 'Cause today all
my dreams will come true *
* Good morning, Baltimore *
* There's the flasher
who lives next door *
* There's the bum on 
his barroom stool *
* They wish me luck
on my way to school *
* Good morning, Baltimore *
* And someday when I take to the floor *
* The world's gonna wake up and see *
* Baltimore and me *
* I know every step *
* I know every song *
* I know there's a 
place where I belong *
* I see all those party lights
shining ahead *
* So someone invite me
before I drop dead *
* Before she drops dead *
* So oh, oh, give me a chance *
* 'Cause when I start
to dance I'm a movie star *
* Oh, oh, oh *
* Something inside
of me makes me move *
* When I hear that groove *
* My ma tells me no *
* But my feet tell me "go" *
* It's like a drummer inside my heart *
* So oh, oh, don't make me wait *
* One more moment for my life to start *
* I love you, Baltimore *
* Every day's like an open door *
* Every night is a fantasy *
* Every sound's like a symphony *
* And I promise, Baltimore *
* That someday when I take to the floor *
* The world's gonna wake up and see *
* Gonna wake up and see *
* Baltimore and me *
* Yes, more or less, we all agree *
* Baltimore and me *
* Someday the world is gonna see *
* Baltimore and me *
Mount Everest is the most
famous, but not the highest...
geographical point on this earth.
Now, who can tell me what that is?
Um, excuse me, Miss Whimsy?
I can't see the board again.
Tracy Turnblad.
If I have to write you up...
for inappropriate hair height
one more time...
you will be removed to detention.
Miss Wimsey, what am I supposed to do?
Hair can't just hang there like a dead thing
on your cheeks.
I mean, well... Uh... you know what I mean.
I... Ahh.
As I said, it is not Mount Everest.
Now, next week we will be talking...
about earthquakes and volcanoes.
And as exciting as that might sound...
we have to look back approximately
60 million years.
Now, if you turn your pages...
we are going to start
with the Ring of Fire.
I want you to contemplate what causes...
the separation of the two components.
Penny, come on, hurry!
Outta my way!
Push! We're late.
Ahh!
- One minute to air.
- OK.
40 to go!
Don't change that channel.
Coming up next: The Corny Collins Show.
30 seconds.
- Hiya, Dad!
- Goodbye!
Hi.
It's my daughter.
10 seconds. Places, everyone.
Hurry up, Penny, we're missing it!
My mom says I'm not
allowed to perspire!
Hey there, teenage Baltimore!
Don't change that
channel 'cause it's time...
for The Corny Collins Show...
Brought to you by Ultra Clutch hairspray.
* Oh, every afternoon when
the clock strikes four *
* Bop bee ba ba ba ba ba ba bee ba *
* Well, a crazy bunch of kids crash
through that door, yeah *
* Bop bee ba ba ba ba ba ba bee ba *
* Well, they throw off their coats *
* And leave the squares behind *
* And then they shake it,
shake it, shake it *
* Like they're losin' their mind *
* You'll never see them frown *
* 'Cause they're the
nicest kids in town *
* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh *
* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh *

turn the sound up *

are gone, yeah *

* Then you twist and shout
for your favorite star *
* And when you've
practiced every step *
* That's in your repertoire *
* You better come on down *
* And meet the nicest kids in town *
Whoo!
* Nice white kids
who like to lead the way *
* And once a month
we have our Negro Day *
* And I'm the man who
keeps it spinnin' round *
* Mr. Corny Collins
with the latest greatest *
* Baltimore sound *
* So, every afternoon drop everything *
Whoo!
* Bop bee ba ba ba ba ba ba bee ba *
* Who needs to read and write *
* When you can dance and sing, yeah! *
* Bop bee ba ba ba ba ba ba bee ba *
* Forget about your
algebra and calculus *
* You can always do your homework
on the mornin' bus *
* Can't tell a verb from a noun *
* They're the nicest kids in town *
* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh *
R... r... r... role call!
I'm Amber.

And I'm... Link.
Aah!
* So, if every night you're shakin' *
* As you lie in bed *
* Mony, mony *
* Shake it, baby *
* And the bass and drums
are poundin' in your head *
* Mony, mony, ooh, mony, mony *
* Who cares about sleep when
you can snooze in school *
* You'll never get to college
but you'll sure look cool *
* Don't need a cap or a gown *
* When you're the nicest kids in town *
They must think my ears
are garbage cans.
Would you turn that racket down?
I'm tryin' to iron here.
* Nicest kids in *
* Kids in town, whoo! *
Ma, it's not racket.
It's The Corny Collins Show.
Well, it's turning your brains into mud.
Mrs. Turnblad, it's a new dance!
The Stricken Chicken.
Well, I can't hear myself think.
How am I supposed to negotiate pleats?
Edna?
I'm in here, Prudy.
What's that racket?
Ohh, Tracy.
Edna, is my laundry ready?
Yep.
That'll be $3.00, hon.
That's pretty pricey
for a pair of petty pants.
Well, I'm sorry, Prudy...
but some-a your personal stains...
required poundin' with a rock.
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
You're letting her listen
to that race music again?
My daughter spends every afternoon
at the Stamp and Coin Club.
Oh, really? Well, your daughter hap...
Ohh, ohh.
Oh, what is that? The Wavin' Raven?
It's a little twitchy.
Oh, you wanna play Charades now.
All right.
OK, go ahead.
You.
Penny.
No. Ahh!
Tracy Turnblad, are you tryin' to tell me...
that... that Penny didn't get permission...
from her mother to be here?
What?
Penny.
You are banned from this house.
You will never watch that show again!
- Without that show I have nothing!
- Having nothing builds character!
Toodle-oo, Edna!
Give 'em a hand, folks.
All right, all right.
And, once again,
that's the Stricken Chicken.
We will be right back
for some more of that hot Detroit sound.
And we're off!
Corny.
"Detroit sound"?
What's that, the cries
of people being mugged?
Aw, Velma, the kids dig
the rhythm and blues.
Yeah, they're kids, Corny.
That's why we have to steer
them in the white direction.
Right direction?
Didn't I say that?
I'll do it.
You try that again and there'll be stumps
where your feet should be.
You got that? You little whor...
Amber.
...holy moly. Baby.
Good job dancing today.
- It's time.
- Ah!
Link.
Amber.
Ah!
- Amber.
- Amber, Amber, Amber.
Save your personal life
for the cameras, sweetie.
Oh! Shiny.
Tammy, Lou Ann,
you're gonna die.
Speaking of cameras,
did you have a nice nap?
If you'd do your job, my daughter wouldn't
have to fight to be visible.
I gotta show some of the
other kids once in a while.
You know, this is a small city.
There aren't that many stations.
This time next year
you could be wearing...
an ill-fitting tux,
snapping bar mitzvah photos.
I don't know.
* It takes two, baby... *
Show Link.
This is nuts. She can't even dance.
Plastic little spastic.
Oh, Link. I can dance
so much better than her.
Why don't you notice me at school?
Mm-hmm.
* Ooh *
Hey, that was our very own Link Larkin
singin' It Takes Two.
And I'm Motormouth Maybelle remindin'...
the last Tuesday of this month's
your rhythm and blues day.
That's right! Negro Day
will be comin' your way.
So don't... uh... Uh... Over here.
Thank you.
So, catch all the croonin'
when y'all set and tune in.
Thank you, Motormouth.
And now it's time to...
Owner's coming. He'll call
my mother again, let's go.
...very own fun-lovin'...
Hey!
Come on up here, Brenda.
What?
Brenda will be taking a leave of absence
from the show.
How long you gonna be gone, Brenda?
Just nine months.
Seems like we'll have an opening
here on the show for a girl...
just as fun-lovin' but maybe
not quite as freewheelin'.
Wanna be one-a
the nicest kids in town?
Cut school tomorrow and come down
to station WYZT to audition.
- No.
- But, Ma.
Don't test me, Tracy Turnblad.
My diet pill's wearin' off.
But come on.
No one is auditioning for
anything in this household.
But why not? Why not?!
Because dancing is not your future.
One day you're gonna own
Edna's Occidental Laundry.
I don't wanna be a laundress.
I wanna be famous!
Look, if you wanna be famous...
learn how to take blood
outta car upholstery.
That's a skill you can take right to the bank.
- Hey, hey. What's all this ruckus in here?
- Not a word.
Daddy, tomorrow I'm auditioning
to dance on a TV show.
- No, she is not.
- You are?
First the hair, now this?
But all the kids are battin' up
their hair now, hon.
You're no help.
It's "ratting," Daddy.
And our first lady,
Jacqueline Kennedy, does it.
I don't believe that.
What do you mean,
you don't believe that?!
- I don't.
- How else would it look that way?
I believe that it is naturally stiff.
She doesn't understand anything.
- Dancing on that show is my dream.
- I know.
Just because she wouldn't know
a dream if it bit her on the nose.
Well, I have information for you, missy.
I once had a dream that I owned
a coin-operated laundromat...
and I came down from that cloud
real quickly, I'll tell you that.
No!
- Oh, Wilbur.
- Fine! I'm going to my room!
She thinks I'm bein' mean
but I'm not. Those TV people...
they don't pick people like Tracy,
or girls like us.
They're gonna hurt her, Wilbur.
I'll talk to her.
Ooh.
'K. Talk to her.
I'll talk to her.
Don't you worry.
OK.
What?
Tracy, this TV thing.
You really want it?
With all my heart.
Then you go for it!
This is America, babe.
You gotta think big to be big.
Big ain't the problem
in this family, Wilbur.
You follow your dream.
Mine came true, and now I have the most
precious thing in the world.
The Taj Mahal of joke shops.
Heh heh heh heh!
Heh heh heh heh!
Back step, cha-cha-cha.
Side step, front step.
Back and turn.
Front step, cha-cha-cha.
Tammy, sharper.
Side step, front step.
Back, again.
Oh, my God, Penny, there's Link.
Link!
Penny, pinch me!
Ow!
You told me to.
I can't believe I'm really here auditioning.
Side step, front step.
I can't believe I'm really
here watching you audition.
Front step, cha-cha-cha.
Back step, cha-cha-cha.
Side step, front step.
Back and t... oh, Amber.
Look at this motley crew.
Oh! This town sure has gone downhill...
since I was crowned
Miss Baltimore Crabs.
Ugh.
* Oh, my God,
how times have changed *
* These girls must be blind
or completely deranged *
* But time seemed to halt *
* When I was Miss Baltimore Crabs *
Amber, that move is far too dirty.
Mother, wake up from
that dream of yours.
- This isn't 1930.
- Ha ha ha.
* You can laugh but life's a test *
* Don't do this, don't do that *
* Remember, Mother knows best *
* For the crown's in the vault *
* From when I won Miss Baltimore Crabs *
* These steps are perfect ammunition *
* Let me show you how your mommy
dear took out the competition *
Girls, go get 'em.
Boys, let's rumba.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
* Those poor runner-ups might
still hold some grudges *
* They padded their cups
but I screwed the judges *
* Those broads thought
they'd win if a plate *
* They would spin in their dance *
Aah!
* Not a chance
Boys, put me down *
Oh, good morning, ladies.
Let's see what you got.
* Twist, twist, twist, twist
mashed potato, mambo *
* Ready, begin *
* On my show you'll never find *
* A thrusting hip or bump and grind *
* What's that?
A dance for fleas and ticks? *
* Oh, you should-a seen my bag of tricks *
* Oh, I hit the stage batons ablaze *
* While belting AÏda
and preparing soufflés *
* But that triple somersault *
* Is how I clinched
Miss Baltimore Crabs *
Proceed.
* Are you scared we're on live? *
* No, I'm sure I can cope *
* Well, this show isn't broadcast in *
* Cinemascope *
* I never drank one chocolate malt *
* No desserts for Miss Baltimore Crabs *
* This one will never get a date *
* In those hand-me-down clothes *
* Ha! Kid, she'll never get a date
till Daddy buys her a new nose *
* I would say "Oy, gevalt" *
* If I wasn't Miss Baltimore Crabs *
* Do you dance like you dress? *
* Amber, there's no need to be cruel *
* Would you swim
in an integrated pool? *
I sure would.
I'm all for integration.
It's the new frontier!
Not in Baltimore, it isn't.
And may I be frank?
* First impressions can be tough *
* And when I saw you, I knew it *
* If your size weren't enough *
* Your last answer just blew it *
* And so, my dear,
so short and stout *
* You'll never be in *
* So we're kicking you out *
* With your form and your face *
* Aw, well, it isn't your fault *
* You're just down with a case *
* Of Miss Baltimore Crabs *
Uh, you may go.
Um... Thank you?
I think they secretly liked you.
Cutting my class, Tracy Turnblad?
I trust it was something really important.
It should've been.
* Gimme a break, yeah.
Right now! *
* Got a brand-new sound,
so scream and shout *
Hey! Hey!
* With a funky rhythm *
* It's a brand-new look that you can... *
Whoo!
* There's a party groovin'
let's get down *
What you lookin' at?
Nothing. Not you.
Can I help you?
That move's swish.
Ya got that right.
The man can dine me
on a diet of detention...
so long as he don't starve
me of my tunes, baby.
- Does that dance have a name?
- Oh, this?
Call it the "Peyton Place After Midnight."
I use it to attract, uh, the opposite sex.
Wow.
That is so groovy.
You're really good.
Why, thank you.
So would it be kinda like this?
You can't do that dance.
Hello, now.
Not bad for a white chick.
- Hey, I know where I've seen you before.
- Where?
On Corny's show on Negro Day.
Negro Day's the best.
I wish every day were Negro Day.
At our house, it is.
Hey. Show me another one?
You wanna see another one.
Well... well, here's a little
something signified to say...
Hello, my name is Seaweed...
Oh, oh, oh!
J...
Stubbs.
What's yours, baby?
I'm Tra-cy Turn-blad!
You're gonna get it, white girl!
Well, Tracy, you got it goin' on, girl.
You one of us.
You're joinin' this program already
in progress!
Well, let's go.
* Whoo! *
* Yeah! *
* Got a brand-new sound,
so scream and shout *
* Hey, a funky beat,
now let's be hurrying *
Whoa!
* We can't wait now *
* Have some fun *
* This party now has just begun *
No, I get who Caesar is.
But what's the "Ideas of March"?
I mean, how can
a month have an idea?
Hold on.
Come on.
* Come on and watch me strut my stuff *
* Watch me *
* Come on and watch me *
How you likin' detention now?
I'm a bad, bad girl who
needs to be punished.
* Ohh *
Hey.
You know, Corny's hosting
the hop tomorrow.
If he saw you dancin' like that...
he'd put you on the show.
Mmm...
- See ya.
- Mm.
Ah, whoa. Sorry, little darlin'.
Hope I didn't dent your 'do.
See y'all later.
Hey, Trace. I was looking for you.
What?
* I can hear the bells *
What? What are you talking about?
* Well, don't-cha hear 'em chime? *
Chime's not exactly how I'd put it.
* Can't you feel my heartbeat
keeping perfect time? *
* And all because he *
* Touched me *
* He looked at me and stared *
* Yes, he bumped me *
* My heart was unprepared *
* When he tapped me *
* And knocked me off my feet *
* One little touch now my life's complete *
- * 'Cause when he nudged me *
- Oh!
* Love put me in a fix *
* Yes, it hit me *
* Just like a ton-a bricks *
* Yes, my heart burst *
* Now I know what life's about *
* One little touch and
love's knocked me out *
* And I can hear the bells *
* My head is spinning *
* I can hear the bells *
* Something's beginning *
* Everybody says that
a girl who looks like me *
* Can't win his love *
* Well, just wait and see *
* 'Cause I can hear the bells *
* Just hear them chiming *
* I can hear the bells *
* My temperature's climbing *
* I can't contain my joy *
* 'Cause I finally found the boy *
* I've been missin' *
* Listen, I can hear the bells *
* Round one *
* He'll ask me on a date and then *
* Round two *
* I'll primp but won't be late because *
* Round three *
* Is when we kiss inside his car *
* Won't go all the way
but I'll go pretty fa-ar *
* Round four *
* He'll ask me for my hand and then *
* Round five *
* We'll book the wedding band so by *
* Round six *
* Amber, much to your surprise *
* This heavyweight
champion takes the prize *
* And I can hear the bells *
* My ears are ringing *
* I can hear the bells *
* The bridesmaids are singing *
* Everybody says that
a guy who's such a gem *
* Won't look my way *
* Well, the laugh's on them *
* 'Cause I can hear the bells *
* My father will smile *
* I can hear the bells *
* As he walks me down the aisle *
* My mother starts to cry *
* But I can't see 'cause Link
and I are French kissin' *
* Listen, I can hear the bells *
* Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh *
* I can hear the bells *
* My head is reeling *
* I can hear the bells *
* I can't stop the pealing *
* Everybody warns
that he won't like what he'll see *
* But I know that he'll
look inside of me *
* Yeah, I can hear the bells *
* Today's just the start 'cause *
* I can hear the bells *
* Until death do us part and *
* Even when we die
we'll look down from up above *
* Remembering the night
that we two fell in love *
* We both will shed a tear *
* And he'll whisper as we're reminiscin' *
* Listen, I can hear the bells *
* She can hear the bells *
* I can hear the bells *
* She can hear the bells *
* I can hear the bells *
* Bum, bum, bum *
* Whoa! *
* Hey, little girl with the cash to burn *
* Well, I'm sellin' somethin'
you won't return *
* Hey, little girl, take me off the shelf *
* 'Cause it's hard havin'
fun playin' with yourself *
* Once you bounce through
the whole selection *
* Shake those hips in my direction *
* Bringing back gifts
she never did see *
* Take me home and then unwrap me *
* Shop around but, little darlin',
I've got to be *
* The ladies' choice *
* Ladies' choice *
* The ladies' choice *
Go on. Get out there and show 'em.
It's packed pretty tight.
OK. I'll go in front of you and I'll push.
* Test drive this American male *
Wait.
* It's gonna take cash to fill my tank *
* It's gonna take cash to fill my tank *
* So let's crack open your piggy bank *
Hey, Seaweed!
Wanna do Peyton Place for Corny?
Are you crazy? You gotta
dance with your crowd...
and I gotta dance with mine.
Why?
It's just the way it is, Tracy.
But it's your dance.
Well, how 'bout you go
borrow it for a second.
- Really?
- Go get it, girl.
* I'm the ladies' choice *
* Ladies' choice *
* Ladies' choice *
Whoo!
All right! Yeah!
Whoa!
* Hey, little girl on a spendin' spree *
* I don't come cheap
but the kisses come free *
* On closer inspection
I'm sure that you'll agree *
* Oh, hey, little girl, listen to my plea *
* I come with a lifetime guarantee *
* One day maybe we'll find
that baby makes three *
Link!
* It's the ladies' choice *
* I'm the ladies' choice *
* I'm the ladies' choice *
* I'm the ladies' choice-choice-choice *
* I'm the ladies' choice *
Mr. And Mrs. Turnblad!
Hey, look out!
Ah!
Mrs. Turnblad!
Mr. Turnblad, come quick!
- Me?
- Come on.
Mrs. Turnblad! Come quick!
You gotta see this!
Oh, I read all about it.
It's a big fake Hollywood set.
No, Mrs...
You think I'm gonna think
that he's really up there?
It's not John Glenn, Mrs. Turnblad!
Well, why are we watchin' this?
Just watch.
- Lou Ann!
- Joey!
Mikey! Vicki! Becky!
Bix! Jesse! Darla!
- Paulie!
- Noreen!
- Doreen!
- Link!
And I'm Tracy!
Aah!
Oh! Oh, my!
* Oh, yeah! *
* And the bass and drums
are poundin' in your head *
Go, Tracy!
- Go, go, Tracy!
- Go, go, Tracy!
* Who cares about sleep when
you can snooze in school? *
* You'll never get to college
but you sure look cool *
* Don't need a cap and a gown *
* When you're the nicest kids in town *
* Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo *
* Kids in town, woo! *
Yeah! That was the dance of the week...
I don't know what happened, Mr. Spritzer.
Corny had some sort
of aneurysm or something...
and... picked her.
...by our brand-new Council Member,
Miss Tracy Turnblad.
So, Trace, come on, cozy up to old Corny
and tell us about yourself.
Well, I watch The Corny Collins Show...
and I do absolutely nothing else!
Ooh! I sure like the way you talk.
Oh, Wilbur, to think that
I almost stopped her...
from reaching for the stars.
And now here she
is on local daytime TV.
She's gonna be a regular.
Imagine, my little girl, regular at last.
I also hope to be the first woman president
or a Rockette.
And if you were president, Tracy...
what would your first official act be?
Hmm.
I'd make every day Negro Day.
I read you like tomorrow's
headlines, Tracy.
What do you think, kids?
You think we might
have a hot new candidate...
for Miss Teenage Hairspray?
That's only the dream of my life.
But Miss Hairspray is mine.
Uh, we're on the air.
And your dream will be
comin' to you, sweetheart...
Saturday, June 2nd,
right here on WYZT.
You have to vote for a person, Corny,
not one of the Himalayas.
Hi, Penny.
Always the charmer, Amber.
I want that chubby communist
girl off the show.
Well, let me be the first
to toss the harpoon.
She's a corrupting influence!
I agree. We don't want our dancers
thrusting like savages!
Hey, speak for yourself.
Don't get flip with me.
I'm not.
Look, now I got some
new ideas for the show.
First, we get rid-a Negro Day.
Finally, some sense outta you.
And we mix those kids in
with the rest-a the Council.
Mix those kids?
That's right, I said it.
This is not a black-and-tan cocktail!
Well, why couldn't it be?
Velma, isn't this where
it's all headin' anyway?
Now, you can fight it
or you can rock out to it.
Maybe it is time for some fresh ideas...
like... like a nice, fresh new host!
Heh.
Gee, Velma,
how do you fire Corny Collins...
from The Corny Collins Show?
They do it all the time on Lassie!
Velma, you've let this go too far!
Me?
- Fix it!
- What?
Fix it!
Ohh!
* Hey, look out for that movin' van *
* Drivin' down our streets *
* You better lock up your man *
* Before he meets the new girl in town *
* Who just came on the scene... *
Tracyface whoopee cushion.
Good choice.
We got your Tracy souvenirs for days.
Here, your signed photos.
Tracy wigs.
* Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa *
* We don't know what to do
'bout the new girl in town *
* The new girl in town *
* Seems to dance on air *
* The new girl in town *
* She's got the coolest hair *
* You better tell the homecoming queen
to hold onto her crown *
* Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa *
* Or she's gonna lose it to *
* The new girl in town *
That big little girl is sending
my sales through the roof.
More people are breathing
aerosol than oxygen!
Do you think you could show us
some of those new dance moves?
Yeah, sure.
Ooh, pretty flowers.
Tracy, wait up!
* She's hip *
* So cool *
* I'm gonna get her after school *
* And yet we'd like to be like her *
* 'Cause she's the kitten
that the cats prefer *
* The new girl in town *
* Has my guy on a string *
* The new girl in town *
* Hey, look, she's wearin' his ring *
* I can't stop cryin' and
so in my own tears *
* I'm gonna drown *
* Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa *
* 'Cause he wants to rendezvous *
* With the new girl *
* We're kinda sad and blue *
* Yes, it's true, girl *
* We'd like to say *
* To the new girl in town *
* The new girl in town *
Hi, I'm here to see Tracy Turnblad.
Where's her write-up?
She doesn't need a detention slip,
she's with me.
Penny, this is Seaweed.
Seaweed, this is Penny.
* Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa *
Huh.
* To the new girl in town *
* The new girl in town *
* Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa *
* From out of the blue, girl *
* Hey, this town's in a stew, girl *
* Ohh, what a hullabaloo, girl *
* She ain't just passing through, girl *
* Ohh, she's sticking like glue, girl *
* Woo, to the man
I thought I knew, girl *
* Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa *
* Hey, look out for that movin' van *
* Look out, look out,
look out, look out *
* She was the new girl in *
* Town *
That's the way you do it.
And I'm your fabled
Miss Motormouth Maybelle...
your DJ du jour,
pitchin' rhythm your way.
So, hey, better stay
and shimmy and sway.
We'll be right back with more Negro Day.
Brought to you by...
Nap-a-Way, for stubborn hair.
Every kink will be gone in a blink.
We're off.
Girls, that was great.
How dare you pick the same song?
They wrote it.
You watch yourself.
You are one inch from being canceled.
You know what your demographic is?
Cleaning ladies and lawn jockeys.
A foot in the door, that's all it is.
One toe at a time.
Eh.
Hello?
Is this the Turnblad residence?
Yes.
Mr. Pinky speakin'.
Mr. Pinky from... from the dress shop?
Uh-huh.
I'd like Tracy
for our spokesgirl.
You want Tracy to do what?
Be our spokesgirl.
Be a spokesgirl?
I think she'd be perfect.
I'd like to meet her...
and discuss the details.
As soon as possible.
OK, um, well, we'll have send
someone down to meet you.
Tonight, if you can.
So, um, oh, OK.
Bye-bye, Mr. Pinky.
Bye-bye.
The Mr. Pinky?
From Mr. Pinky's hefty hideaway!
A spokesgirl?!
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, tell me I get a free caftan, tell me!
Oh, Tracy, I think perks like
caftans have to be negotiated.
Maybe we should get you an agent.
OK. You be my agent.
What? Tracy Turnblad...
has fame gone to your head
and made you wacky?
Well, why not?
Who's goin' to look out for me...
better than my mom?
Me, an agent?
You see me hobnobbin'
and drinkin' rum and cokes...
with all those hoi pollois?
And out-negotiating them.
Oh, you're crazy.
Oh, Tracy, I haven't left
this house in... in years.
Then isn't it time you did?
Oh, no, Tracy.
We'll have your father meet with him.
L... I don't wanna be seen like this.
Why not?
I'll do it after my next diet.
That's when I'll do it.
Ya see, the neighbors haven't
seen me since I was a size 10.
Don't make me do it, Tracy.
Ma, it's changing out there.
You'll like it.
People who are different.
Their time is coming.
* Hey, Mama, hey, Mama, look around *
* Everybody's groovin'
to a brand-new sound *
* Hey, Mama, hey, Mama follow me *
* I know somethin's in ya
that you wanna set free *
* So let go, go, go of the past now *
* Say hello to the love in your heart *

the world's spinning fast now *

since someone asked me to dance *
* So let go, go, go of the past now *
* Say hello to the light in your eyes *
* Yes, I know that the world's
spinning fast now *
* But you gotta run
the race to win the prize *

* Oh-o-o-o-o *
* Oh, Mama, welcome to the sixties *
* Oh-o-o-o-o *
* Go, Mama, go, go, go *
* Welcome to the sixties *
Ma, you did it!
Oh, Tracy, I'm a little lightheaded.
There's so much air out here.
Can't we go someplace that's stuffy?
No, Ma, you're on your way.
* Hey, Mama, welcome to the sixties *
* Oh-o-o-o-o *
* Oh, Mama, welcome to the sixties *
* Oh-o-o-o-o-o *
* Go, Mama, go, go, go *
Oh. They're so glamorous.
Wow.
It kicked.
Let's toast to that.
To a boy!
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *
* Welcome to the rhythm
of a brand-new day *
* Take your old-fashioned fears *
* And just throw them away *
* You should add some color
and a fresh new 'do *
* 'Cause it's time for a star *
* Who looks just like you *
Ohh.
Ah!
Oh!
I thought we marked these down.
What?
Ohh.
Thank you, Nadine.
There's my shining star!
Fantastic to meet you!
I'm Mr. Pinky.
It's so nice to meet you.
Ha ha! Tracy, is this your older sister?
Oh, my.
Perhaps she'd like some
complimentary couture.
Couture?
Now, if you'll just sign here.
Flattery will not distract
Miss Turnblad's agent...
from reading the fine print.
Her agent?
Tracy, eat your donuts.
Let's talk.
Mm-hmm.
All right, let's see here.
All right. Now...
Mmm.
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. No!
I want a non-exclusive contract.
Extensions by mutual option.
And I want you to absorb
my 15 percent commission.
Not a dime over 10!
Throw in a bustier?
Hmm.
54 double D?
Triple E.
I hit the mother lode!
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *
Care for a Baby Ruth?
I got one right here.
* Oh-o-o-o-o *
* Oh, Mama, welcome to the sixties *
* Oh-o-o-o-o *
* Go, Mama, go, go, go *
* Don't-cha let nobody
try to steal your fun *
* 'Cause a little touch of
lipstick never hurt no one *
* The future's got a million
roads for you to choose *
* But you'll walk a little taller
in some high-heeled shoes *
* And once you find the style
that makes you feel like you *
* Something fresh,
something new *
* Step on out, hear us shout *
* Mama, that's your cue *
* Ba da ba da-ba-da *
* Step on out, hear us shout *
* Mama, that's your cue *
* Hey, Tracy, hey, baby, look at me *
* I'm the cutest chickie
that you ever did see *
* Hey, Tracy, hey, baby, look at us *
* Where is there a team
that's half as fabulous *
* I let go, go, go of the past now *
* Said hello to this red carpet ride *
* Yes, I know that the world's
spinning fast now *
* Tell Lollobrigida to step aside *
* Your Mama's welcoming the sixties *
* Oh-o-o-o-o *
* Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-baby *
* Oh-o-o-o-o *
* Go, Mama, go, go, go *
* Welcome to the sixties *
* Open the door to the girl who has more *
* She's a star, Tracy, go, go, go *
* Hey, Mama, welcome to the sixties *
* Your mama's hip, your mama's in *
* Hey, Mama *
* Your mama's lookin' at herself
and wonderin' "Where you been?" *
* Where you been? *
* Your mama's lit, she's all aglow *
* Your mama, what she's holdin' back *
* Your mama's gotta let go, go, go *
* Welcome to the "six", to the "O" *
* To the apostrophe "s"
hey-yay, baby, yeah *
* Oh-o-o-o-o *
* Oh, yeah *
* Go, Mama, go, go, go *
* Oh-o-o-o-o-o,
oh-o-o-o-o-o *
* Oh-o-o-o-o go,
go, Mama, go, go, go! *
Mmm. Mmm.
Wait till Dad sees you.
Sees me?
He never notices what I wear.
In 20 years, he's never even said to me,
"nice muumuu" or nothin'.
Now he will.
Well, maybe, if he leaves
that shop for 5 minutes.
I swear, I don't know
what goes on down there.
Well.
Mrs. Turnblad.
I'd know whose mother
you were anywhere.
Really?
Hello, Amber.
Hello, Tracy.
Ma, this is Amber and Mrs. Von Tussle.
Mrs. Von Tussle is the station's manager.
Oh, the station manager.
Oh! Oh, it was so nice-a
you let her on that show.
Well, Tracy certainly has...
redefined our standards. Ha ha!
That's for sure.
Let me guess...
brand-new dress?
Oh, yes.
Well, you'll stop traffic.
Ha ha ha.
It was nice meeting you. Tracy.
Bye, Tracy.
Ugh.
Ma, don't listen to a word she says!
I'm takin' this back.
Don't you dare.
- I am.
- Don't you dare.
Don't you know why she hates us?
She's afraid I'll beat Amber
for Miss Teenage Hairspray.
Really?
They can't put Tracy in special ed.
I won't have it.
I mean, even if I have to tutor her myself...
they cannot hold my friend back.
- You're a saint.
- Mm.
Oh, and it's totally not true about her
and the entire football team.
I mean, please.
Anybody can get grass stains
all over their back.
Amber, stop it.
I'm sick-a you doin' that.
Just because she's a good dancer.
Uh! I'm sorry.
You think that she can dance?
Well, maybe you'd rather
have her as your partner.
You could get sponsored by Goodyear.
Excuse me. What is
going on back there?
Tracy, that's horrible.
Mr. Flak does not have breasts.
What? No. I would... I would never.
What... Oh.
Oh, and Mr. Larkin,
perhaps you'd like to share...
with the rest of the class Patrick Henry's
immortal last words.
"Kiss my ass"?
You didn't have to do that, Link.
Hey, no prob.
Besides, looks like
a cool scene down here.
Right.
Hey, cool.
Hey, Tracy!
Not quite, huh?
Ah, damn. Just when I was gettin' it.
Listen, man,
you ain't gotta stop now.
My mom's havin' a platter party tonight.
Y'all wanna come check it out?
Now?!
Would you mind if I, too, checked it out?
I've never been to North Avenue before.
Uh, well, would it be safe?
You know, for us?
Calm down, cracker boy.
It's cool.
Wow.
Being invited places by colored people!
It feels so hip!
I'm glad y'all feel that way
'cause, uh, not many people do.
- Y'all know what I'm sayin'?
- Yeah, that's right.
* Hey! *
* I can't see why people look at me *
* And only see the color of my face *
* Ah, yeah, then there's those that try
to help, God knows *
* But always have to put me in my place *
* But I won't ask you to be color-blind *
* 'Cause if you pick the fruit then, girl,
you're sure to find *
* The blacker the berry,
the sweeter the juice *
* I could say it ain't so but, darlin',
what's the use? *
* The darker the chocolate,
the richer the taste *
* And that's where it's at *
* Now, baby, run and tell that *
* Now run and tell that *
* Run and tell that *
* Run and tell that *
* Hey, yeah! *
* I can't see why people disagree *
* Each time I tell 'em what
I know is true, oh, no *
* And if you come *
* And see the world I'm from *
* I bet your heart is
gonna feel it, too, yeah *
* I could lie but, baby, let's be bold *
* Vanilla can be nice *
* But if the truth be told *
* Blacker the berry,
the sweeter the juice *
* I could say it ain't so but, darlin',
what's the use? *
* The darker the chocolate,
the richer the taste *
* And that's where it's at *
* Oh, baby, baby, run and tell that *
* Run and tell that *
* Go run and tell that *
* Run and tell that *
* Come on and run and tell that *
* Run and tell that *
* Hey, run and tell *
* Go tell *
* Run and tell that *
Link!
Link Larkin!
* Hey, yeah! *
* Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah *
- Whoo!
- Hey!
Whoo!
* Whoo! *
Come here, girl.
This is my sister, Little Inez.
Oh, I know Tracy Turnblad.
Good for you, girl.
You got on the show.
- Well, you better be next.
- Ya got that right.
Oh, you know she is.
You better show 'em, girl.
Yeah!
* I'm tired of coverin' up all my pride *
* So give me five on the black hand side *
* I got a new way of movin'
and I got my own voice *
* So how can I help but
to shout and rejoice *
* Oh, the people 'round here
can barely pay their rent *
* They try to make a dollar
outta fifteen cent *
* But we got a spirit
money just can't buy *
* It's deep as a river
and soars to the sky, to the sky! *
* Hey, I can't see the reason it can't be *
* The kinda world where
we all get our chance *
* Aw, yeah *
* The time is now *
* So we can show 'em how
just turn the music up *
* And let's all dance, yeah, yeah *
* 'Cause all things are equal
when it comes to love *
* Well, that ain't quite true
'cause when push comes to shove *
* The blacker the berry,
the sweeter the juice *
* They say it ain't so but, darlin',
what's the use? *
* The darker the chocolate,
the richer the taste *
* And that's where it's at *
* Now, baby, baby, baby,
run and tell that *
* Run and tell that *
* Run and tell that *
* Ah yeah, baby*
* Run and tell that *
* Go run and tell that *
* G-g-g-g-go home
and run and tell that *
* Yeah, yeah *
* Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah *
* Whoo! *
- Go, baby!
- Whoo!
It was horrible.
Mom, he just danced on that bus...
with that great white whale
and those negroes.
No, honey.
Reeling him back in is
the easiest thing in the world.
Remember, I control his career.
Ohh.
Now, don't worry.
Mommy will take care of everything.
Are you all hungry
for some good fun?
* Yeah *
* Bring on that pecan pie *
* Pour some sugar on it,
sugar, don't be shy *
* Scoop me up a mess
of that chocolate swirl *
* Don't be stingy,
I'm a growin' girl *
* I offer big love with no apology *
* How can I deny
the world the most of me? *
* I am not afraid
to throw my weight around *
* Pound by pound by pound *
* Because I'm big,
blonde and beautiful *
* Face the fact,
it's simply irrefutable *
* No one wants a meal
that only offers the least *
* When, girl, we're servin'
up the whole damn feast *
Well, looks like y'all
took a step outta bounds.
Now, who we got here?
Mom, I want you to meet my new friends.
This here is Link. Tracy Turnblad.
This is just so afro-tastic!
And this young lady right here...
is Penny Pingleton.
I'm very pleased
and scared to be here.
Oh, now, honey. We got more reason
to be scared on your street.
Latoya, put that record down.
You gonna scratch it.
Can't you keep your little girl...
Shall we dance?
Come on.
My name is Mike.
Mike?
Yes, Mike.
Mike who?
It's Mike.
Anyway, ahem...
I'm calling because
I have some information...
about your daughter's whereabouts.
- What?
- Right now, as we speak...
your daughter has entered
a hotbed of moral...
turpentine.
* Baby don't sleep *
* Baby don't eat *
* Baby just like another boink-boink *
Link, aren't you gonna get
in awful trouble for this?
I'm not plannin' on tellin' my dad.
No, I mean in trouble
with someone else.
Hmm. Maybe.
Maybe it's worth it.
I think knowin' you's the start
of a pretty big adventure.
Ahh!
Tracy Edna Turnblad!
Ooh, we get any more
white people in here...
this gonna be a suburb.
Do you know what I had to pay a cab...
just to consider comin' down here?
Oh, uh, Mom...
No call. You just disappear.
And all mashed up against a crooner?
Um, Edna Turnblad, this is Link.
Come on, we're goin'.
And, Penny, go home before
your mother shoots you.
Miss Edna, is it?
Hi, I mean, you don't
have to rush off, you know.
Well, I do. I left my iron on.
Oh, your iron.
Well, before you go...
you sure you
wouldn't like to have...
a little somethin' to eat?
Mmm-mmm.
Is that braised?
* Whoa oh oh oh oh oh *
* Whoa oh oh oh oh oh *
* Slice me off a piece
of that hogshead cheese *
* Whoo! *
* And take a look inside *
* My book of recipes *
* Now, don't-cha sniff around
for somethin' fluffy and light *
* We need a man who brings
a man-size appetite *
* We'll use a pinch-a sugar
and a dash-a spice *
* I'll let you lick the spoon
because it tastes so nice *
* We keep it in the oven
till it's good and hot *
* Keep on stirrin' till it hits the spot *
* Because I'm big,
blonde and beautiful *
* There is nothin' 'bout us
that's unsuitable *
* Why sit in the bleachers
timid and afraid *
* When, Edna, you look
like the whole parade? *
* They say that white
has might and thin is in *
* Well, that's just bull *
* 'Cause, ladies, big is back *
* And as for black, it's beautiful *
* All shapes and sizes follow me *
* Who wants a twig when
you can climb a whole tree *
