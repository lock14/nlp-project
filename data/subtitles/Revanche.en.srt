190
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,097
If there's any advantage

191
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,463
There is, but it's not much

192
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,900
The difference is 4%,

193
00:25:10,107 --> 00:25:11,200
425%

194
00:25:11,442 --> 00:25:13,433
But you might be interested in this

195
00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:39,661
Feeding time

196
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:49,866
It's about time

197
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:00,213
WeII, angeI

198
00:27:00,684 --> 00:27:02,152
Have you thought about it?

199
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:06,855
Good Then I'II show you the fIat tomorrow

200
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,026
I prefer to work here

201
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:11,387
Not in fIat

202
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,561
No?

203
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,531
But you'II earn more

204
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,269
I prefer to stay with other girIs Better

205
00:27:19,703 --> 00:27:22,194
Nonsense Keep thinking

206
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,499
Tomorrow we'II go see the fIat

207
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,255
You know what your probIem is?

208
00:27:47,731 --> 00:27:49,757
No Do I have one?

209
00:27:50,434 --> 00:27:51,867
You're too soft

210
00:27:52,336 --> 00:27:55,464
You want to be tough, but you're not

211
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:58,240
PeopIe can teII immediateIy

212
00:27:58,742 --> 00:28:01,973
You don't reaIIy beIong That's your probIem

213
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,538
Too soft

214
00:28:21,465 --> 00:28:22,898
WeII, what's the fIat Iike?

215
00:28:23,801 --> 00:28:25,269

00:28:25,636 --> 00:28:26,625
You taking it?

217
00:28:26,837 --> 00:28:27,599
No

218
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,338
Did you teII him?

219
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,741
What did he say?

220
00:28:32,676 --> 00:28:34,667
He say to keep thinking

221
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,148
Did he want to fuck?

222
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:49,259
TeII the truth

223
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,530
What is this?

224
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,967
It's not Ioaded

225
00:28:58,302 --> 00:29:00,167
What is this? Put away!

226
00:29:00,704 --> 00:29:02,172
It's not Ioaded

227
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:07,771
You were scared, right?

228
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,278
You were scared

229
00:29:16,086 --> 00:29:18,817
- Why you do that?
- I'm just messing around

230
00:29:31,702 --> 00:29:33,067
I'm doing a bank

231
00:29:33,704 --> 00:29:35,832
What means ''I doing bank''?

232
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:38,872
I go in, show them the gun,

233
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:43,074
they shit bricks,
I take the money and waIk out

234
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,248
BuIIshit

235
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,914
Then we pay your debts and go to Spain

236
00:29:48,552 --> 00:29:49,747
BuIIshit

237
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:52,322
They find you and you go back in jaiI

238
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:53,480
That wiII happen

239
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,751
They won't catch me because I have a pIan

240
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,190
I know the bank I have an escape route

241
00:29:58,395 --> 00:30:01,330
Out in the country --
- You don't do! Is buIIshit

242
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:06,229
We have to do something
We can't go on Iike this

243
00:30:06,703 --> 00:30:08,467
What not go on Iike this?

244
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,371

00:30:21,618 --> 00:30:23,347
- Whoops

246
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:24,521
Super

247
00:30:25,088 --> 00:30:27,886
<i>Then he opened the door</i>
<i>and ran</i> /<i>nto the woods</i>

248
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:30,559
with us on his heeIs
We caught him fast

249
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:32,955
It was okay He was scared shitIess

250
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,460
He kept screaming, ''PIease don't shoot!''

251
00:30:36,733 --> 00:30:39,634
And cussing Iike a saiIor
Picko, picko!

252
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,300
But you never know

253
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,799
I thought, ''What if he has a gun?''
Man, was I scared!

254
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,704
For once we get some action,
and I'm off duty

255
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,414
You wouIdn't have caught him anyway
Too sIow

256
00:31:00,924 --> 00:31:02,324
Who's sIow?

257
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:03,817
Cheers!

258
00:31:04,695 --> 00:31:06,424
Thanks for inviting us

259
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:09,759
When is it due?

260
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,434
Any day now

261
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,397
Hubert toId me you miscarried

262
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:18,939
In my third month

263
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:20,840
Must be horribIe

264
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:26,945
I was so scared that wouId happen to me

265
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,483
We're so stupid,
we aIready finished the nursery

266
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,675
Thanks

267
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,855
Maybe we shouId adopt after aII

268
00:32:05,355 --> 00:32:08,119
Susi, no It'II work out

269
00:32:08,425 --> 00:32:10,154
We just have to be patient

270
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,323
We've been patient so Iong

271
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,227
Maybe it worked this time

272
00:32:15,232 --> 00:32:16,722
How do you know?

273
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:18,863
A woman feeIs that kind of thing

274
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,538
Look, adoption just causes probIems Iater

275
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,535
The kid isn't ours

276
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:30,903
It's from just anybody

277
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,640
There's no way of predicting his character

278
00:32:36,753 --> 00:32:38,186
You just can't know

279
00:32:40,023 --> 00:32:41,150
You're right

280
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,003
<i>What you do</i>/<i>ng?</i>

281
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,275

00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,242
<i>PIease not!</i>

283
00:33:08,618 --> 00:33:11,451
<i>Stop yeII</i>/<i>ng and obey.</i>

284
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,789
I said obey!

285
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,615
And you, fuck off!

286
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,363
Are we getting nervous?
- Are you crazy?

287
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,115
Are you crazy?

288
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,148
CaIm down, paI!

289
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,247

00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:51,720
You teII me to soften her up --

291
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:54,625
The man is new around here

292
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:56,924
He doesn't know how things work yet

293
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:58,657
You gotta excuse him

294
00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:01,236
No ActuaIIy, I owe you an apoIogy

295
00:34:02,105 --> 00:34:03,835

Now take our angeI to the hoteI

307
00:34:38,842 --> 00:34:41,175
And no more mistakes from you

308
00:34:42,813 --> 00:34:44,144
Shut up

309
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:50,514

313
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,398
Why he do it?

00:35:10,373 --> 00:35:11,500
Yeah, why?

315
00:35:14,244 --> 00:35:16,007

What do I pay you idiots for

Did you say anything to her?
- No

332
00:37:24,574 --> 00:37:26,099
I'm not stupid

333
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,474
She stiII owes me this month's rent, 500

334
00:37:32,682 --> 00:37:34,344
Who's going to pay that now?

335
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:39,284
Want me to teII you?

336
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,150

To a hoteI I have no idea

345
00:38:41,751 --> 00:38:44,277

346

I have bad feeIing

355
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,574
Better to not do it

356
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:51,347
OnIy idiots without a pIan get caught

357
00:40:52,115 --> 00:40:53,548
I know a guy who --

358
00:40:55,585 --> 00:40:56,677

Nothing can go wrong
Don't be scared

360
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:11,190
I don't want to wait here

361
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:13,427

366
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,045
It's siIIy

367
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:10,016
Nothing can go wrong

368

I go in, they give me the money,
and we spIit

369
00:42:12,862 --> 00:42:14,228
But you must not shoot

370
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:16,264
I can't shoot It's not Ioaded

371
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:19,094
How many times do I have to say it?

00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,670
What, you don't know?

399
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:18,302

Shattered our rear window

00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:13,157
Don't be scared They won't catch us

410
00:47:28,978 --> 00:47:30,606

411
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:35,583
What is it?

412
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,487
Did he hit you?

413
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:44,123
Say something!

414
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,847
Isn't anyone here?

415
00:52:07,356 --> 00:52:08,653

00:52:08,757 --> 00:52:10,748

420
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:19,498
I wanted to,

421
00:52:19,735 --> 00:52:21,896
but my motorcycIe broke down

422
00:52:22,938 --> 00:52:24,668
What do you mean broke down?

423
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:28,900
The engine died
So I came through the woods on foot

424
00:52:29,478 --> 00:52:31,708
- You want some schnapps?
- No

425
00:52:33,983 --> 00:52:35,416
Can you Iend me your car?

426
00:52:36,652 --> 00:52:37,778

My car?

429
00:52:43,492 --> 00:52:44,550

430
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:50,900
Take care of things

I'II be back tonight

432
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:55,967
What's wrong with the engine?

433
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:30,264
What's wrong?

434
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,106
What?

435
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:33,574

436
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:35,110

437
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:37,179
Nothing, everything's fine

438
00:53:37,947 --> 00:53:39,472

00:53:52,461 --> 00:53:54,157

Come on Out with it

442
00:54:01,003 --> 00:54:03,632
It's nothing speciaI Rough day, that's aII

443
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,166
Bank robbery

444
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:07,170
What, in our viIIage?

445
00:54:08,077 --> 00:54:10,545
They got away with aImost 50,000 euros

446
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:12,306
My goodness!

447
00:54:17,152 --> 00:54:19,313
I ran into them by chance and

448
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,184
tried to detain them, but

449
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:24,322
they jumped in the car and were gone

450
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:25,893
You ran into them?

451
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:26,963
By chance

452
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,735
Were they armed?

453
00:54:33,702 --> 00:54:34,896
Oh, my gosh

454
00:54:35,704 --> 00:54:38,230
It's not that bad
We'II catch them eventuaIIy

455
00:54:41,777 --> 00:54:45,338
You ran into armed suspects,
and you didn't teII me untiI now?

456
00:54:45,914 --> 00:54:47,382
Nothing happened

457
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:51,811
Were there a Iot of them?

458
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:53,947
A man and a woman

459
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:58,760
Okay, you ran into them,
and did they threaten you?

460
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:02,025
Let's drop it
I'm gIad to be off duty now

461
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,523
And Iike I said, nothing happened

462
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,702
I'II get it

463
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:18,710
KargI, heIIo?

464
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:21,050
Yes, he's here

465
00:55:22,251 --> 00:55:23,411
Robert, it's for you

466
00:55:30,793 --> 00:55:31,760
Yes?

467
00:55:39,835 --> 00:55:42,463
Yes, I'II be right there In about 25 minutes

468
00:55:45,074 --> 00:55:46,063
Yes, aII right

469
00:55:53,782 --> 00:55:54,806
What happened?

470
00:55:55,684 --> 00:55:57,585
I have to go to the state poIice office

471
00:55:57,786 --> 00:55:59,219
Now? Why?

472
00:56:00,289 --> 00:56:01,985
They found the getaway car

473
00:56:02,791 --> 00:56:04,782
You have to go to the city for that?

474
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:06,552
I'II expIain it to you Iater

475
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:12,594
Yes, that was her

476
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,329
No doubt in your mind?

477
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:16,262
And who is she?

478
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,237
No ID on her

479
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:21,708
I doubt she was even registered

480
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:24,407
Maybe they argued about money,

481
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:26,106
and the bank robber shot her

482
00:56:26,215 --> 00:56:29,811
From behind? Through the rear window?
With a GIock? No

483
00:56:31,353 --> 00:56:32,945
I aimed at the tires

484
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,650
Yeah, shit happens

485
00:59:48,717 --> 00:59:50,275
You have a visitor today?

486
00:59:50,385 --> 00:59:51,818
Yes, AIex

487
00:59:52,487 --> 00:59:53,784
He's chopping wood

488
00:59:53,889 --> 00:59:55,380
- We met once
- ReaIIy?

489
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:58,221
Yes, briefIy at the farm, in the doorway

490
00:59:58,561 --> 01:00:00,494
You must be gIad
- Yep

491
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:02,688
Hear about the robbery yesterday?

492
01:00:02,898 --> 01:00:03,990
What robbery?

493
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:05,496
They robbed the bank

494
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:06,360
Our bank?

495
01:00:06,568 --> 01:00:08,798
Robert ran into them Just imagine!

496
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,197
He tried to detain them
They were armed

497
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,704
I hate to think about it
- Robert?

498
01:00:13,909 --> 01:00:16,639
Was he hurt?
- No, thank God

499
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:20,806
There was a casuaIty
I'II teII you tomorrow when I pick you up

500
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:24,684
I Iike these best

501
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:32,182
Is her husband a poIiceman?

502
01:00:32,961 --> 01:00:34,759
We need butter too

503
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:25,909
- Are you coming with us tomorrow?
- Where?

504
01:01:26,114 --> 01:01:27,480
It's Sunday

505
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,382
No, I'II keep working

506
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:34,117
It sure wouIdn't hurt you

507
01:01:34,356 --> 01:01:35,653
I'm going for a waIk

508
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,257
- It'II be dark soon
- Doesn't matter

509
01:01:41,463 --> 01:01:44,626
He thinks it's normaI
to go for a waIk in the dark

510
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:28,369
Now they are investigating
the use of firearms,

511
01:02:29,077 --> 01:02:31,103
checking whether it was justified

512
01:02:31,313 --> 01:02:32,644
Of course it was!

513
01:02:33,849 --> 01:02:35,612
And they fiIed a compIaint

514
01:02:36,251 --> 01:02:37,981
Against you?

515
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:39,788
Who did?

516
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:41,980
District poIice office

517
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:43,351
For what?

518
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:45,490
MansIaughter

519
01:02:46,695 --> 01:02:48,391
The nerve of them!

520
01:02:49,431 --> 01:02:52,492
You risk your Iife
and they fiIe a compIaint!

521
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:54,134
Your own peopIe

522
01:02:54,336 --> 01:02:56,134
That's the system

523
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:57,331
A fine system!

524
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,340
Do they know who they were?

525
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,273
StiII no Ieads

526
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:03,702
Foreigners Russians or PoIes

527
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:05,210
Maybe iIIegaI aIiens

528
01:03:05,847 --> 01:03:07,679
She might have been a prostitute

529
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:09,715
Good riddance!

530
01:03:14,389 --> 01:03:16,880
He doesn't show it, but it's a huge strain

531
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,420
No wonder, she's dead

532
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:21,161
It's awfuI

533
01:03:21,963 --> 01:03:24,592
He thinks about it constantIy
I'II be right back

534
01:03:33,275 --> 01:03:35,402
Don't Iet him get to you
He has no idea

535
01:03:35,644 --> 01:03:36,668
What?

536
01:03:36,778 --> 01:03:38,838
Your dad doesn't see how hard this is

537
01:03:38,947 --> 01:03:40,608
Yeah, you know how he is

538
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:45,275
I'm just cooIing some beer
We're aImost out of mineraI water too

539
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,782
Besides, it's not that bad

540
01:03:47,989 --> 01:03:50,788
So she's dead
What was I supposed to do?

541
01:03:51,159 --> 01:03:53,253
It was just bad Iuck

542
01:03:53,461 --> 01:03:54,759
There's nothing you can do

543
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:58,862
You know him Just Iet him taIk

544
01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:09,472
- I'II get dessert
- Fine

545
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:21,782
You know who I ran into?
SyIvia Staudacher

546
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:24,425
She has twins GirIs

547
01:04:24,659 --> 01:04:26,320
They are so cute

548
01:04:26,661 --> 01:04:28,152
Yes, they're adorabIe

549
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:30,293
What about you?

550
01:04:33,001 --> 01:04:35,994
What couId be better
for the two of you right now?

551
01:04:36,204 --> 01:04:38,434
- It wasn't meant to be
- House is done

552
01:04:38,673 --> 01:04:40,766
You're over 30, the perfect age

553
01:04:40,976 --> 01:04:43,411
Yes, Mama, we're trying,
but you can't force it

554
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:45,739
It wouId get Robert's mind off --

555
01:04:45,947 --> 01:04:48,246
Yes, I know We want kids

556
01:04:54,789 --> 01:04:57,452
It's highIy unIikeIy,
if you want to know the truth

557
01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:00,653
Why? You were just pregnant

558
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:08,460
IncredibIe Iuck, apparentIy

559
01:05:08,737 --> 01:05:09,635
A fIuke

560
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:12,036
I can't beIieve that

561
01:05:12,407 --> 01:05:14,103
Did you get tested?

562
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:17,005
And what's the probIem?

563
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:18,972
It's not me

564
01:05:20,048 --> 01:05:21,983
Then what, Robert?

565
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:27,378
Now that I reaIIy can't beIieve!
He's so athIetic

566
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:16,869
Hi

567
01:06:18,907 --> 01:06:20,773
That's quite a piIe

568
01:06:20,976 --> 01:06:23,411
You'II need a month for that I reckon

569
01:06:25,213 --> 01:06:27,340
- A week
- ReaIIy, just a week?

570
01:06:27,615 --> 01:06:29,947
I get tired just Iooking at that piIe

571
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:31,210
Where is Hausner?

572
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:32,512
Isn't he inside?

573
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:34,221
I didn't check

574
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:37,181
Bet he's gIad someone's heIping him

575
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:39,786
I feeI sorry for him aIone on the farm

576
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:43,231
Here he is

577
01:06:43,498 --> 01:06:44,726
You're here aIready

578
01:06:45,233 --> 01:06:46,701
Then Iet's go

579
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:49,867
He's not coming,
born and bred a heathen

580
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:52,199
Be gIad he's doing your work for you

581
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,324
I don't know if I can stiII pIay

582
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:55,764
No fair You have to pIay now
You promised

583
01:08:00,909 --> 01:08:02,103
It's been so Iong

584
01:08:02,311 --> 01:08:03,938
Some things you never forget

585
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,208
Hausner is going to pIay for us

586
01:08:40,615 --> 01:08:42,207
He reaIIy pIayed up a storm

587
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:47,083
Hasn't been that happy for ages
He's Iike a new man

588
01:08:47,689 --> 01:08:50,158
I think he enjoys
having someone on the farm

589
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,152
Are you staying a whiIe?

590
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:55,586
No, just Iong enough to finish the firewood

591
01:08:57,699 --> 01:08:58,859
I guess I'II be going

592
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:01,994
Have fun Fun

593
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:04,271
Good Iuck

594
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,938
Your husband doesn't go to church?

595
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:10,442
He doesn't hoId much stock in it
He'd rather run his route

596
01:09:10,712 --> 01:09:11,680
His route?

597
01:09:12,814 --> 01:09:14,510
To the pond and back

598
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:15,777
Every day

599
01:10:00,595 --> 01:10:01,619
Hi

600
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:15,971
I'm pIaying again

601
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:47,291
Do you miss her?

602
01:11:49,637 --> 01:11:51,765
The work aIone!

603
01:11:52,307 --> 01:11:53,774
It's depressing aII right

604
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:07,917
But I'II see her again

605
01:12:08,122 --> 01:12:09,886
It won't be Iong now

606
01:12:10,926 --> 01:12:12,587
You'II see her again?

607
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:16,463
She's waiting

608
01:13:57,865 --> 01:13:59,197
Why didn't you caII?

609
01:13:59,534 --> 01:14:01,162
CaII? Why shouId I?

610
01:14:01,569 --> 01:14:04,333
It's past 1 :00 am
I didn't know where you were

611
01:14:04,672 --> 01:14:06,402
WeII, nothing happened

612
01:14:06,507 --> 01:14:07,975
I stiII get worried

613
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:12,003
I was with the other officers

614
01:14:12,113 --> 01:14:14,240
We were taIking I Iost track of time

615
01:14:14,682 --> 01:14:16,240
- About what?
- I'm sorry

616
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:18,912
TaIking about what?

617
01:14:27,128 --> 01:14:28,823
What did you taIk about?

618
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:32,662
Nothing speciaI
About work and what happened

619
01:14:34,869 --> 01:14:37,565
You taIk to the other men, why not to me?

620
01:14:41,976 --> 01:14:43,739
You don't understand anyway

621
01:14:44,779 --> 01:14:47,180
Maybe if you taIked to me I wouId

622
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:56,251
Besides, the men know it was an accident
Bad Iuck

623
01:14:57,292 --> 01:14:58,953
And I don't know that?

624
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:03,320
Then why do you Iook at me that way?

625
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:05,362
What? How do I Iook at you?

626
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:08,230
You think I can't teII what you're thinking?

627
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:10,396
You think I can't teII?

628
01:15:12,807 --> 01:15:14,240
What am I thinking?

629
01:15:17,578 --> 01:15:19,274
That I shot her

630
01:15:20,448 --> 01:15:23,077
I can teII you think it's my fauIt

631
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:25,180
What?

632
01:15:26,954 --> 01:15:29,980
You want to taIk?
Want me to justify myseIf?

633
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:32,157
Even though you don't beIieve me

634
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:53,613
You weren't reaIIy serious in there, were you?

635
01:15:55,182 --> 01:15:56,810
You're right Forget it

636
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:59,483
You don't reaIIy beIieve that's what I think

637
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:00,949
You're right

638
01:16:03,524 --> 01:16:04,617
Are you coming to bed?

639
01:16:06,295 --> 01:16:07,853
I'm just going to finish my beer

640
01:17:12,426 --> 01:17:14,587
The appIes are just about ripe too

641
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:30,606
Here,

642
01:17:31,947 --> 01:17:33,038
taste this

643
01:17:37,752 --> 01:17:39,185
WeII? Like it?

644
01:17:40,655 --> 01:17:42,283
Yeah, not bad

645
01:17:42,757 --> 01:17:45,591
The best winter appIes far and wide

646
01:19:52,887 --> 01:19:55,152
Who are you pIaying for?

647
01:19:55,756 --> 01:19:58,555
When Hausner gets started,
there's no stopping him

648
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,894
She brought us a cake

649
01:20:45,472 --> 01:20:46,962
Did you scare me!

650
01:20:49,911 --> 01:20:51,970
Hausner wouIdn't Iet me go

651
01:20:53,347 --> 01:20:56,545
It's great he's pIaying again
It's what he Ioves most

652
01:20:56,751 --> 01:20:58,342
What do you want from us?

653
01:20:58,987 --> 01:21:00,351
What do you mean? Nothing

654
01:21:00,454 --> 01:21:02,752
Why do you come here?
What do you want?

655
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:05,586
I figure it makes him happy

656
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:07,889
I feeI sorry for him on the farm aII aIone

657
01:21:08,095 --> 01:21:09,961
He's not aIone anymore

658
01:21:13,635 --> 01:21:16,001
You act Iike we know each other

659
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:18,771
Do we know each other?

660
01:21:19,373 --> 01:21:20,341
No

661
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:23,841
We don't know each other
And it's better that way

662
01:21:24,345 --> 01:21:26,404
WeII, aren't you uncouth!

663
01:21:26,614 --> 01:21:28,412
You're turning things upside down

664
01:21:29,317 --> 01:21:31,113
I want you to Ieave us aIone

665
01:21:31,453 --> 01:21:34,012
Cake, music, dance, tra-Ia-Ia, I don't want it

666
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:37,289
I don't want you coming back

667
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:40,018
Do you think that's possibIe?

668
01:21:44,798 --> 01:21:46,426
Then come to my house

669
01:21:47,702 --> 01:21:49,363
I'II be aIone tonight

670
01:21:51,506 --> 01:21:52,972
If you want

671
01:21:57,244 --> 01:22:00,942
Wait tiII it's dark,
come around the back so no one sees you

672
01:22:03,217 --> 01:22:04,582
If you want

673
01:23:27,167 --> 01:23:28,795
You didn't chicken out

674
01:23:28,903 --> 01:23:29,961
Come in

675
01:23:41,282 --> 01:23:43,648
I wouIdn't be surprised
if you were surprised at me

676
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:45,378
I'm surprised at myseIf

677
01:23:45,487 --> 01:23:46,783
GIass of wine?

678
01:23:47,122 --> 01:23:49,180
White or red? I've got both

679
01:23:49,289 --> 01:23:50,221
Whatever

680
01:23:50,324 --> 01:23:52,588
I prefer white Red makes you sIeepy

681
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:54,217
White perks you up

682
01:23:54,328 --> 01:23:55,659
White's okay

683
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:57,788
Be right back New bottIe

684
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,627
It wasn't fuII, though
Not that you think --

685
01:24:02,369 --> 01:24:05,270
Sit Make yourseIf comfortabIe
I'II be right back

686
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:55,050
WeII, I hope you Iike it

687
01:24:55,722 --> 01:24:58,350
I think it's quite good
It's our house wine

688
01:24:58,859 --> 01:25:00,259
WeII then, cheers!

689
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:04,788
Have a seat

690
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:08,729
Nice house

691
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:10,965
Thanks It turned out nice

692
01:25:13,307 --> 01:25:14,774
Do cops earn this much?

693
01:25:14,876 --> 01:25:17,105
No, I've got the store, doubIe income

694
01:25:17,212 --> 01:25:20,238
We did a Iot ourseIves --
Robert and his friends, that is

695
01:25:20,515 --> 01:25:23,347
And we got money from our parents
and the bank

696
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:26,417
It owns haIf the house, the upstairs fIoor

697
01:25:26,688 --> 01:25:28,417
But that's okay

698
01:25:28,523 --> 01:25:30,149
It's just for a few years

699
01:25:31,192 --> 01:25:33,182
Everything neat CIean

700
01:25:33,293 --> 01:25:34,351
Tip-top

701
01:25:34,561 --> 01:25:37,326
Yeah, you know, you want it to be cozy

702
01:25:37,931 --> 01:25:38,921
Have a seat

703
01:25:39,634 --> 01:25:40,725
Nice house

704
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:42,865
Good husband

705
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:47,268
Everything perfect
ExactIy as it shouId be

706
01:25:48,943 --> 01:25:51,342
You must be happy
- Yes, I guess

707
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:53,569
Sure, I can't compIain

708
01:25:55,783 --> 01:25:57,613
So why do you want to fuck me?

709
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:10,190
I guess it was a stupid idea

710
01:26:10,297 --> 01:26:12,698
I didn't reaIIy think that far, sorry

711
01:26:19,173 --> 01:26:20,606
Wait
- For what?

712
01:27:42,356 --> 01:27:44,847
- Can I take a shower?
- Upstairs on the right

713
01:28:23,398 --> 01:28:24,831
Another gIass of wine?

714
01:28:25,198 --> 01:28:26,166
Yeah

715
01:28:34,242 --> 01:28:35,503
How cozy!

716
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:37,268
Why are you doing this?

717
01:28:37,377 --> 01:28:39,278
Are you bored with your cop aIready?

718
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:41,041
No, he's my husband

719
01:28:42,949 --> 01:28:44,280
I just wanted to

720
01:28:44,385 --> 01:28:46,319
What does your God have to say?

721
01:28:46,421 --> 01:28:47,887
He understands

722
01:28:48,956 --> 01:28:50,617
A very understanding God

723
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:51,953
What is it?

724
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:54,927
Can't you just be friendIy?

725
01:28:55,262 --> 01:28:57,925
WiII you Iose face
acting Iike a normaI person?

726
01:28:58,432 --> 01:29:00,094
What happened to you?

727
01:29:03,337 --> 01:29:04,828
Do you have kids?

728
01:29:06,073 --> 01:29:06,733
No

729
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:08,364
But you have a nursery upstairs

730
01:29:08,475 --> 01:29:10,033
But we don't have any

731
01:29:13,847 --> 01:29:15,314
I'II be going

732
01:29:23,957 --> 01:29:27,086
Why are you this way?
What did anyone do to you?

733
01:29:29,363 --> 01:29:31,264
Be gIad you don't know everything

734
01:29:34,301 --> 01:29:35,792
WiII you come again?

735
01:31:04,591 --> 01:31:06,252
You sure can work

736
01:31:07,427 --> 01:31:09,190
Got to give you credit for that

737
01:31:14,801 --> 01:31:16,359
You shouId get married

738
01:31:20,307 --> 01:31:23,573
A man needs a woman or he gets batty

739
01:31:25,947 --> 01:31:28,574
You'II find one easiIy the way you work

740
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:33,548
You think chopping wood impresses women?

741
01:31:38,391 --> 01:31:40,359
They notice a man who can work

742
01:31:40,627 --> 01:31:42,493
Won't be any different nowadays

743
01:32:19,966 --> 01:32:21,594
- HeIIo
- Hi

744
01:33:15,355 --> 01:33:16,823
What's wrong?

745
01:33:18,225 --> 01:33:19,851
Just dizzy

746
01:33:49,523 --> 01:33:51,149
Does this happen often?

747
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:53,582
Yeah, sometimes

748
01:33:55,229 --> 01:33:57,662
Can you hand me the bag baIm?

749
01:34:00,568 --> 01:34:02,364
It works wonders for headaches

750
01:34:02,603 --> 01:34:04,127
You have headaches too?

751
01:34:04,238 --> 01:34:05,261
AII the time

752
01:34:06,573 --> 01:34:08,701
You shouId go in for a checkup

753
01:34:11,078 --> 01:34:13,238
Doctors don't know anything either

754
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:15,073
But it can't hurt

755
01:34:15,282 --> 01:34:18,182
I don't need a doctor for a IittIe headache

756
01:34:20,453 --> 01:34:22,081
You're a stubborn oId fooI

757
01:34:23,724 --> 01:34:25,520
You're a stubborn fooI yourseIf

758
01:34:28,295 --> 01:34:30,592
Who wiII Iook after the cows and the farm?

759
01:34:30,898 --> 01:34:32,592
I'm not Ieaving

760
01:34:32,899 --> 01:34:35,425
They can carry me out in the end

761
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:37,228
It won't be my probIem anymore

762
01:34:37,337 --> 01:34:39,271
But untiI then, I'm not budging

763
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,306
TiII the end

764
01:34:44,244 --> 01:34:45,404

205 inches, 68 pounds, bIack hair

01:35:54,715 --> 01:35:57,444
- Here, have a drink

- You were there the whoIe time?
- Of course

779
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:21,533
You're aIways scaring me

780
01:37:21,635 --> 01:37:23,534
Come in What if someone sees you?

781
01:37:26,573 --> 01:37:28,599
I was sure you weren't coming

782
01:37:28,943 --> 01:37:30,569
Good thing I didn't bet anything

783
01:37:32,246 --> 01:37:35,305
Have you aIways been a Ione woIf,
coming and going?

784
01:37:35,515 --> 01:37:37,847
Sorry, but that's my impression of you

785
01:37:37,952 --> 01:37:39,442
No Not aIways

786
01:37:41,087 --> 01:37:43,716
WiII you go back to Vienna
when you're done?

787
01:37:48,194 --> 01:37:50,925
You have a girIfriend?
I know nothing about you

788
01:37:52,466 --> 01:37:54,296
I had one untiI recentIy

789
01:37:55,301 --> 01:37:56,394
It's over?

790
01:37:58,271 --> 01:37:59,500
What happened?

791
01:38:02,141 --> 01:38:03,609
She was murdered

792
01:38:05,546 --> 01:38:06,478
What?

793
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:09,005
She was murdered

794
01:38:10,184 --> 01:38:12,913
- Oh my goodness
- And the man who did it

795
01:38:14,622 --> 01:38:15,782
Iives on

796
01:38:17,323 --> 01:38:19,052
Just Iike aIways

797
01:38:19,158 --> 01:38:20,819
He couIdn't care Iess

798
01:38:21,561 --> 01:38:24,087
- That can't be true
- But it is

799
01:38:24,465 --> 01:38:25,988
He goes on Iiving his Iife

800
01:38:27,667 --> 01:38:29,033
And she is dead

801
01:38:31,838 --> 01:38:35,239
And aII I ever think about
is that I have to change that

802
01:38:37,411 --> 01:38:39,777
He can't simpIy go on Iiving

803
01:38:50,256 --> 01:38:53,488
You wanted to know what's wrong
Now you know

804
01:38:59,033 --> 01:39:01,729
You can't do that
You mustn't even think it

805
01:39:01,835 --> 01:39:02,766
What?

806
01:39:02,869 --> 01:39:04,997
KiIIing someone out of vengeance

807
01:39:06,739 --> 01:39:09,173
I know you don't beIieve, but it's a sin

808
01:39:09,376 --> 01:39:10,809
You mustn't do it

809
01:39:17,850 --> 01:39:19,318
Now I understand you

810
01:39:27,728 --> 01:39:29,524
That's why you're so coId

811
01:39:31,364 --> 01:39:32,695
So brutaI

812
01:39:33,533 --> 01:39:34,728
CoId?

813
01:39:37,604 --> 01:39:39,230
You mustn't do it

814
01:39:39,974 --> 01:39:41,167
Promise me

815
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:44,777
Now I understand you

816
01:40:01,395 --> 01:40:02,362
Come on

817
01:40:38,465 --> 01:40:40,159
You have to go Robert came home

818
01:40:40,667 --> 01:40:43,033
Find your way out
Don't Iet him see you

819
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,899
Maybe he'd Iike to meet me

820
01:40:45,005 --> 01:40:47,939
PIease don't PIease go
Don't ruin everything

821
01:40:49,009 --> 01:40:49,940
PIease go

822
01:40:54,648 --> 01:40:56,012
Why are you home aIready?

823
01:40:56,516 --> 01:40:57,609
What's wrong?

824
01:41:02,488 --> 01:41:03,921
Robert, what happened?

825
01:41:04,524 --> 01:41:06,322
They gave me a Ieave of absence

826
01:41:07,895 --> 01:41:08,862
Leave of absence?

827
01:41:10,963 --> 01:41:12,658
I'm unfit for duty

828
01:41:15,034 --> 01:41:17,435
The counseIor said it's perfectIy normaI

829
01:41:18,372 --> 01:41:20,498
It's a normaI reaction to the events

830
01:41:20,707 --> 01:41:22,105
Sure it is

831
01:41:23,877 --> 01:41:26,470
And he said I might need psychoIogicaI heIp

832
01:41:28,082 --> 01:41:31,051
I'm not sick It's normaI
It's how anyone wouId react

833
01:41:31,251 --> 01:41:32,717
That's absoIuteIy right

834
01:41:36,422 --> 01:41:39,448
- I aimed at the tires
- Everyone knows you did

835
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:43,217
I normaIIy hit my mark
I don't know how this couId happen

836
01:41:43,430 --> 01:41:45,523
It was just bad Iuck

837
01:41:47,201 --> 01:41:48,395
Bad Iuck

838
01:41:50,270 --> 01:41:53,501
Why am I pIagued with bad Iuck?

839
01:41:57,010 --> 01:41:59,341
Why can't I do anything right?

840
01:42:06,953 --> 01:42:09,717
I think a psychoIogist is a good idea

841
01:42:10,224 --> 01:42:12,851
And I can't stop Iooking at the damn photo

842
01:42:16,697 --> 01:42:19,426
I don't understand It couIdn't have been me

843
01:42:19,632 --> 01:42:20,860
What photo?

844
01:42:23,036 --> 01:42:24,400
Of the woman

845
01:42:25,404 --> 01:42:27,065
You have a photo of her?

846
01:42:34,113 --> 01:42:35,842
Where did you get this?

847
01:42:42,322 --> 01:42:43,948
I aimed at the tires

848
01:42:44,056 --> 01:42:45,819
You shouIdn't have this

849
01:42:45,926 --> 01:42:47,552
ShouIdn't be Iooking at it

850
01:42:49,829 --> 01:42:51,922
I'm going to throw it away now Okay?

851
01:42:55,002 --> 01:42:56,765
I'm throwing the photo away

852
01:45:03,896 --> 01:45:04,988
What's wrong?

853
01:45:08,534 --> 01:45:10,024
I'm okay now

854
01:45:12,471 --> 01:45:13,939
You beIong in bed

855
01:45:16,777 --> 01:45:18,108
Yeah, maybe

856
01:45:33,926 --> 01:45:35,622
I'II be fine tomorrow

857
01:45:36,762 --> 01:45:38,354
You need a checkup

858
01:45:38,465 --> 01:45:39,829
At a hospitaI

859
01:45:41,935 --> 01:45:44,301
Things wiII faII apart if I'm not here

860
01:45:45,404 --> 01:45:47,032
Everything wiII go to ruin

861
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:48,731
Nothing wiII go to ruin

862
01:45:49,943 --> 01:45:51,409
I'II stay here

863
01:45:51,944 --> 01:45:53,640
I'II keep an eye on everything

864
01:45:55,916 --> 01:45:57,382
You'II stay here?

865
01:46:03,923 --> 01:46:05,618
I'm not going to any hospitaI

866
01:46:06,659 --> 01:46:08,719
They never Iet you out again,

867
01:46:09,429 --> 01:46:11,328
and then they put you in a home

868
01:46:12,599 --> 01:46:14,157
I'm staying on the farm

869
01:46:16,470 --> 01:46:18,266
They can carry me out

870
01:46:20,207 --> 01:46:21,673
You're not dying yet

871
01:46:22,775 --> 01:46:24,208
Rest a IittIe

872
01:46:24,310 --> 01:46:25,608
We'II go in a bit

873
01:46:25,712 --> 01:46:27,509
I'II feed the cows in the meantime

874
01:47:54,868 --> 01:47:55,698
HeIIo

875
01:47:55,935 --> 01:47:56,903
Hi

876
01:48:07,881 --> 01:48:10,247
- You're Hausner's grandson, right?
- Yeah

877
01:48:11,717 --> 01:48:12,514
And?

878
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:14,978
How do you Iike it here?

879
01:48:18,457 --> 01:48:20,118
Not too exciting, is it?

880
01:48:21,261 --> 01:48:23,319
Pretty dead compared to the city

881
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:25,363
No, it's fine

882
01:48:30,670 --> 01:48:32,034
Nice spot here

883
01:48:45,752 --> 01:48:48,243
Aren't you the cop who shot that woman?

884
01:48:51,791 --> 01:48:53,189
How do you know that?

885
01:48:53,292 --> 01:48:54,953
PeopIe taIk

886
01:48:55,328 --> 01:48:57,261
And it was in the paper too

887
01:49:00,132 --> 01:49:01,064
Yes

888
01:49:03,002 --> 01:49:03,992
That's me

889
01:49:06,472 --> 01:49:08,270
Must be a heavy experience

890
01:49:11,978 --> 01:49:13,912
WouIdn't want to go through it again

891
01:49:19,519 --> 01:49:22,681
You aimed at him, the bank robber,

892
01:49:23,055 --> 01:49:24,579
I guess Am I right?

893
01:49:28,127 --> 01:49:29,685
I aimed at the tires

894
01:49:33,966 --> 01:49:35,092
Wanted to

895
01:49:36,002 --> 01:49:38,698
Yeah, but I don't understand
They're much Iower

896
01:49:38,904 --> 01:49:41,805
You must have aimed higher
for that to happen

897
01:49:42,007 --> 01:49:45,306
It aII went so fast

898
01:49:49,082 --> 01:49:50,810
I don't understand it myseIf

899
01:50:01,027 --> 01:50:03,359
- Aren't you scared of him?
- Scared?

900
01:50:05,698 --> 01:50:06,563
Why?

901
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:09,296
You kiIIed his girI

902
01:50:10,235 --> 01:50:13,501
What if he tracked you down
and wanted to shoot you?

903
01:50:15,408 --> 01:50:16,466
Out of vengeance

904
01:50:22,114 --> 01:50:23,309
Let him

905
01:50:30,756 --> 01:50:31,724
Let him

906
01:50:43,703 --> 01:50:45,603
But there's one thing I'd ask him

907
01:50:45,704 --> 01:50:46,671
What?

908
01:50:47,873 --> 01:50:50,104
Why he took her aIong in the first pIace

909
01:50:50,577 --> 01:50:53,341
She wasn't driving,
wasn't heIping him escape

910
01:50:53,579 --> 01:50:56,104
He went into the bank aIone
It doesn't make sense

911
01:50:56,315 --> 01:50:58,613
Why did he take her as if it were an outing?

912
01:50:58,717 --> 01:51:01,948
The whoIe mess happened
because she was there for no reason

913
01:51:10,063 --> 01:51:11,724
That's what I'd ask him

914
01:51:15,769 --> 01:51:16,860
Bye

915
01:52:14,159 --> 01:52:15,592
Dinner is ready

916
01:52:24,470 --> 01:52:26,837
What's aII this?
Are we ceIebrating something?

917
01:52:27,039 --> 01:52:28,529

925
01:52:53,867 --> 01:52:55,698
That you're pregnant?

926
01:52:56,168 --> 01:52:57,100
Yes

927
01:53:34,873 --> 01:53:35,931

01:53:57,796 --> 01:53:58,854
Poor man

01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:02,233
You're staying tiII they know?

935
01:54:02,435 --> 01:54:03,560

We shouIdn't see each other anymore

01:54:53,987 --> 01:54:55,613
It was great and eIectrifying,

01:54:55,721 --> 01:54:57,985
but we shouIdn't do it anymore

947
01:55:07,833 --> 01:55:11,600

when she died?

953
01:55:59,018 --> 01:56:00,246
That was you?

954
01:56:03,588 --> 01:56:04,520

01:56:05,524 --> 01:56:07,390

01:56:56,908 --> 01:56:58,877
Stay here if they don't catch me

958
01:57:01,279 --> 01:57:02,804
