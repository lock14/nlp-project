2
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,720
You knew my dad, right?

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,080
He wasn't senile.\NMore of a bossy go-getter.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,440
Then he started to bug me, bigtime.

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,200
He bugged me as a whole,\Nbut this was new.

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,720
Before, he'd only pretend to consult me.\NHe'd say'Do this'

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,160
and I'd do it.

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,200
Now he starts asking\Nmy advice on everything,

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,080
what I'd do if I were him...

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,760
even what I think of him\Nballing his female staff!

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,320
I hated it. It grossed me out.

12
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,840
He went on like we were buddies.\NIt drove me nuts!

13
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,240
Then it clicked.\NThis wasn't my dad, here.

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,840
He'd become like a kid\Nthat I was responsible for.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,520
Like I was the dad, see?

16
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,440
See what happens?

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,040
You wake up one morning\Nand things have switched places.

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,200
Gimme a light.

19
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,200
The bitch of it is, you're helpless.

20
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,840
You can scream and kick\Nthe walls, it's no goddamn use.

21
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,120
Time's moved on,\Nyour dad's an old man,

22
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,160
you're not immortal anymore.

23
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,040
Do you believe in God?

24
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,600
Times like that\Nmake you start to believe.

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,680
Finally, you learn to put up with it.

26
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,360
Then my dad fell sick and l...

27
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,000
I nursed him like a baby.

28
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,320
Wiped his ass, fed him,\Ncleaned his mouth...

29
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,560
The worst thing was,\NI didn't want it to stop.

30
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,800
The year after that,\NI had my first kid.

31
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,640
THE BEAT THAT MY HEART SKlPPED

32
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,240
I don't see why.

33
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,080
I really don't see why.

34
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,680
I told you about a house\Non Rue Carrel.

35
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,000
On the east side.\NYou didn't mention the west side.

36
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,480
Whichever side,\Nyou knew it was my patch!

37
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,240
Why not the whole region?

38
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,800
You pulled a fast one on me,\Nadmit it.

39
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,920
Can't you kill the sound\Nand your cigar?

40
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,760
- How much d'you want?\N- Dunno.

41
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,000
Don't know?

42
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,080
50-50?

43
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,840
50-50? I set up the deal\Nand you take half for nothing?

44
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,080
Hot stuff!

45
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,640
Hang on!\NI can bring know-how and cash.

46
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,560
Sure! Take a lot of know-how\Nto make me swallow that.

47
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,760
What's your offer?

48
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,840
Nothing. Nada!

49
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,640
You're the one sweating it.\NI don't need you.

50
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,760
That's a new one!

51
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,960
Hear that, Sami?

52
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,880
I don't give a shit.\NDo your business.

53
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,200
Do your deal\Nand stop crapping about it.

54
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,320
I'll give you'l don't need you.'

55
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,000
In the last six months...\NWho found the warehouses?

56
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,320
Without me, you'd still be\Nhaggling with that old bag.

57
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,120
- And the tennis courts...\N- Tennis courts?

58
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,200
The acre along the highway.

59
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,840
If you don't remember that,\Nwhat you need is a doctor!

60
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,880
So what's your offer?

61
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,960
I told you, 50-50.

62
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,480
OK, plus half of the Belgrand deal.

63
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,440
Like fuck!\NBelgrand's worth four times Massy!

64
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,040
Don't give me that!

65
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,200
If Massy's worth shit,\Nwhy make such a big deal of it?

66
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,640
- This it?\N- On the left.

67
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,480
Cut it out!

68
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,000
You go that way.

69
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,080
Two floors up.

70
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,360
I can't see!\NGimme a flashlight. You have a spare.

71
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,120
What's going on up there?

72
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,400
Search me. A rat must've bit him.

73
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,000
The asshole scared me!

74
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,920
- What's up, Sami?\N- It ran up my leg and bit me!

75
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,440
Where? Let me see.

76
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,920
- Fuckin' bit me all over!\N- I can't see.

77
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,240
- What do you want?\N- My smokes.

78
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,440
OK, fuck you.

79
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,480
Fuck you!

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,080
I've thought it over. It's a deal.

81
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,680
- What's a deal?\N- What we said.

82
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,840
Massy and the Belgrand place, 50-50.

83
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,560
- When's the due date?\N- 22nd.

84
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,240
- How much under the table?\N- 500,000.

85
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,040
250,000 each. OK with you?

86
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,760
One thing I don't get about Beefy.

87
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,440
If he hates rats,\Nwhy does he plant them?

88
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,200
- Why not plant something else?\N- What, snakes?

89
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,680
Or his mother?

90
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,360
- Feeling better?\N- And you?

91
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,600
Go away!

92
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,000
When will you be done?

93
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,360
This part tonight.\NThe rest in two days, minimum.

94
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,880
Thursday?

95
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,800
I'm signing the deal at 1 1 AM.\NGet me the plans by 8.

96
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,040
- I can't.\N- Course you can!

97
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,160
What's the rush?\NWe can beat him down.

98
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,080
He owes Martens 60,000.\NI'll tell Martens to collect.

99
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,480
Why would he?

100
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,240
I know him. He owes me one.

101
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,680
If he finds out,\Nwe'll find ourselves buying from him.

102
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,800
Don't be Paranoid. He won't know.

103
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,200
You handle Martens,\NI'll fix the lawyer and City Hall.

104
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,920
You can't go in there!\NYou're trespassing!

105
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,680
They broke the lock!

106
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,200
You're trespassing on private property!

107
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,520
Where are you going? Get out!

108
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,040
- What's your problem?\N- I own this place!

109
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,920
Clear out.

110
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,120
- You're crazy!\N- No, I'm the owner.

111
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,520
- No entry!\N- I live here.

112
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,320
No! No, you don't.

113
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,360
Where were you?

114
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,080
Stuck in traffic. I came quick...

115
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,040
Can't you ever do what you say?

116
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,360
I was stuck in traffic!

117
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,480
Bullshit! The watchman says\Nyou never came here once.

118
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,600
And now look!

119
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,840
Get this zoo out of here!

120
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,920
- Who are you?\N- Leave them alone.

121
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,840
Who are you?

122
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,080
Housing Rights group.\NYou the owners?

123
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,320
Guess!

124
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,600
This is illegal.

125
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,200
The law's on our side.

126
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,320
They've been here 48 hours.

127
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,680
There's water, Power.\NIt's their home now.

128
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,560
You want your building back,

129
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,480
find a place to rehouse them.

130
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,040
We can get the cops.

131
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,680
The cops are right there. Go get them!

132
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,960
They're not squatters, they're families.\NThat's the point.

133
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,640
They've only occupied the street side,\Nnot the back yet.

134
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,240
Get Lesrec and his guys here quick\Nor we're stuck for six months.

135
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,680
How many aPartments are there?

136
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,080
Won't be so easy now!

137
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,280
Halfass!

138
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,960
Hi.

139
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,160
Did you order?

140
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,720
I was waiting for you.

141
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,400
Boy, that looks... What is it?

142
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
Electro.

143
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,000
Try it?

144
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,360
You dig this for real?

145
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,960
Seriously?

146
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,160
I listen to it!

147
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,040
What's this shit called again?

148
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Why are you jumpy? Balls itch?

149
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,080
You wanted to talk.

150
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,160
What if I got married again?

151
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,800
Do I know her?

152
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,840
Not yet. I asked her\Nto come meet you.

153
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,040
Wait till you see her.\NA beaut!

154
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,000
She's got tits...

155
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,120
legs up to her chin...\Nand an ass!

156
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,080
That should do.

157
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,640
Am I making you awkward?

158
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,440
Do you have to marry her?

159
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,880
Have to?

160
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,520
No, why?

161
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,440
She's not pregnant.

162
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,720
That's not what I meant.

163
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,400
Tell me straight.\NYou say no, I won't.

164
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,280
Do it, Dad.\NIf that's what you want.

165
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,040
If it makes you happy, do it.

166
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,840
Sure! Do it.

167
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,120
One other thing.

168
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,160
There's a couscousjoint\Nowes me six months' rent.

169
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,120
Every time I ask for it, he whines,

170
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,160
'My wife's pregnant,\Nmy daughter's getting married,' etc.

171
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,960
Guess what? The rat's buying\Ntax-deductible real estate!

172
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,720
He's fleecing me\Nand lining his nest with it!

173
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,120
Can you fix him?

174
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,240
- It won't take you a minute.\N- I said OK.

175
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,760
I wrote it all down here.

176
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,680
Here comes Gorgeous!

177
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,360
My son Thomas, Chris.

178
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,680
I have a call to make.\NSit there, I won't be long.

179
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,080
- Want a drink?\N- A kir.

180
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,920

181
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,600
So you're Robert's son?

182
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,000
What do you do?

183
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,760
I model, for catalogs.

184
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,360
And commercials, if I can.\NI auditioned for one this morning.

185
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,200
Competition must be stiff.

186
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,240
All those East European girls.

187
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,440
Why East European?

188
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,160
It's just the way I heard it.

189
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,120
You're in real estate, like Robert?

190
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,160
- How's business?\N- OK.

191
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,800
So what's Chris short for?

192
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,040
Yvonne?

193
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,920
No, Christine.

194
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,440
Are you getting at me?\NDid I offend you?

195
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,680
Why are you getting at me?

196
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,160
Just kidding.\NAre you serious about Robert?

197
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,960
I think so.

198
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,280
We haven't known each other long.

199
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,520
We go out and have fun.\NHe makes me laugh.

200
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,560
Introduces me to PeoPle.

201
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,120
I love my dad.

202
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,440
I don't want him taken for a ride\Nand have to pick up the pieces.

203
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,160
Did you order?

204
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,400
I can't stay.

205
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,240
Order, I'll be back.

206
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,720
Why are you leaving?

207
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,840
I forgot an aPPointment.

208
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,200
How do you like her?

209
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,720
You're the one marrying her.

210
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,760
I know, but what do you think?

211
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,960
Nothing.

212
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,640
What's that mean?

213
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,600
She's a whore, Dad.

214
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,600
Why? Because she\Nmodels and stuff?

215
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,160
Because she's a whore!

216
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,840
You asked me, I answered.

217
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,480
Hey, forget it.

218
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,640
Forget it. Sorry I spoke.

219
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,080
Mr. Fox!

220
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,720
Could you ask that gentleman...

221
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,880
Don't you recognize me?\NThomas Seyr.

222
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,280
Sonia's son?

223
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,000
Tom, right?

224
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,880
- How old are you now?\N- 28.

225
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,760
You're here for the concert?

226
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,680
- Did you hear him play at Pleyel?\N- I missed it.

227
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,920
You'll see he's very good.\NI'm his manager.

228
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,120
Have you kept it up?

229
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,320
Music?

230
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,520
Do you still play the piano?

231
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,360
Yes... and no.

232
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,600
It got comPlicated after Mom died.

233
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,400
That's a shame.\NYou had talent.

234
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,320
I remember you\NPlayed something for me.

235
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,920
A Haydn sonata, number 32.

236
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,920
It's starting.

237
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,960
I'll be off.

238
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,320
Here's my card.

239
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,600
Come play piano for me.

240
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,000
Come for an audition.

241
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,920
Call my assistant and set a date.

242
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,400
Don't let me down.

243
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,440
I can't focus.

244
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,520
Try again?

245
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,080
I'm too...\NMy heart's beating too hard.

246
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,520
No good!

247
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,040
I'm too nervous. I can't do it.

248
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,600
- It's not perfect.\N- Very close.

249
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,960
CIose but not quite!

250
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
It Iooks easy but...

251
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,160
It's very clean.

252
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,920
But the emotion is not very generous.

253
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,520
Can I help you?

254
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,000
- You last played when?\N- About ten years ago.

255
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,520
Ten years without Practice?

256
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,040
I practice.\NI never gave up completely.

257
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,240
I play for myself,\Nwhen I'm in the mood, or for friends.

258
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,640
And now you're auditioning?

259
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,400
That's right.

260
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,800
You're too old for the conservatory.

261
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,760
For a comPetition?

262
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,840
For an agent. A manager.

263
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,960
Manager?

264
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,480
So he'll take me on.

265
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,320
I'm confused.

266
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,520
You're not a professional pianist?

267
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,480
So why a manager?

268
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,080
He offered to audition me.

269
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,480
My mother was a concert Pianist...\NHe managed her concerts.

270
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,360
I grew uP with music.\NThere was always a Piano at home...

271
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,960
I know about it.

272
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,320
If I'm good,\NI think he'll take me on.

273
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,160
As what? A pianist?

274
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,280
A concert pianist?

275
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,200
May I ask what you do?

276
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,080
I work.

277
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,480
In what fiield?

278
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,920
I work in real estate.

279
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,440
I'm a broker, see?

280
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,240
I plant rats in buildings,\Ncut off the water and power.

281
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,160
Sometimes me and my pals\Ngo in with baseball bats

282
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,160
and force people out of their homes.

283
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,800
What exactly do you want?

284
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,880
Play me something, go on.

285
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,720
- What are you doing?\N- Fuck you, prick!

286
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,320
What's the big idea?

287
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,600
It's an agency downtown.

288
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,720
Call Madame Bouffera.\NI spoke with her.

289
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,680
06-22-68-90-12

290
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,360
I told you about it. I'm not wacko.

291
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,560
Tell her I sent you and call me back.

292
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,040
What do you want?

293
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,160
I heard you talking to our teacher.

294
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,960
You want piano lessons?

295
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,920
Just someone to judge my playing.

296
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,080
I have a friend, a Pianist.

297
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,040
Her name is Miao Lin.\NShe just arrived in Paris.

298
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,800
She studied at the Beijing Conservatory

299
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,040
and won a two-year scholarship.

300
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,000
She has given lessons and concerts.

301
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,080
Are you interested?

302
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,680
DePends.

303
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,560
If so, call this number\Nand ask for Jean-Pierre.

304
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,200
- Who's Jean-Pierre?\N- Me.

305
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,480
What's this rathole?

306
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,120
I've got business nearby.

307
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,360
How's it going?

308
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,240
A strange thing happened.

309
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,520
Remember Mr. Fox?\NHe managed Mom's concerts.

310
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,800
Tall, faggoty jerk?

311
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,280
I ran into him, we talked.\NGuess what?

312
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,280
He asked me for an audition.

313
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,440
Audition? You?

314
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,840
Why not me?

315
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,240
Think I'm not uP to it?

316
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,200
Audition for what?

317
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,680
I don't know yet. DePends.

318
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,640
DePends on what?

319
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,880
Look how your mom ended uP.

320
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,320
Don't talk about her that way.

321
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,000
What way do you want?

322
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,000
Your Fox is a pimp.

323
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,040
He didn't deal\Nwith her fits like I did.

324
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,720
At the end, you didn't even see her.\NIt was me she talked to.

325
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,080
Don't give me that shit.

326
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,400
What's it to be?

327
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,000
Same as him.

328
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,320
Remember that favor I asked you?

329
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,000
What favor?

330
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,800
The couscousjerk\Nwho owes me six months rent.

331
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,960
Sorry, no time.

332
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,200
No time?

333
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,480
Time to see that fag\Nand get psyched up about pianos,

334
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,520
but not 20 minutes for me.

335
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,680
Don't get anal about it. I forgot.

336
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,440
I'll see him, end of story.

337
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,720
That's handy. He's across the street.

338
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,680
I don't believe it!\NHow can you Pull this on me?

339
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,600
You said you'd do it, do it.

340
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,640
Is this Payback time or what?

341
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,080
Will you do it or not?

342
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,880
No way! Not like this.

343
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,320
Fix your own shit.

344
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,680
Right.

345
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,480
Asshole.

346
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,680
Beat it!

347
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,760
Mounir! The kitchen's on fiire!

348
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,560
Quick! There's a fire!

349
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,080
Freeze!

350
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,160
My dad's money!

351
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,360
Touch my dad again, I'll kill you.

352
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,760
Here.

353
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,320
Not so hard, was it?

354
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,520
Do me a favor.\NForget me for a while.

355
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,040
Is that how you want it?

356
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
How else do you want it?

357
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,960
Dammit, Dad!

358
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,960
My friend, Miao Lin.

359
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,320
What is your name?

360
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,720
What do you need exactly?

361
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,280
For an audition,\Nto know where I stand.

362
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,000
Hold it. Doesn't\Nshe speak French?

363
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,960
She only just got here.

364
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,680
Only Chinese?

365
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,960
Chinese, Viet, and a little English.

366
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,560
Does it matter, no French?

367
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,080
No smoking, no talking?\NPain in the...

368
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,080
We will work it out, don't worry.

369
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,880
She can coach you real well.

370
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,720
She has coached musicians\Nfor competitions.

371
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,520
She is very good.

372
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,040
Do you need some tea?

373
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,600
What about timing and money?

374
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:39,320
Mornings she has classes,\Notherwise she's free.

375
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,280
Every day at 2 PM, OK?

376
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,800
That one looks good.

377
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,680
It's Pushing it, sizewise.

378
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,200
Over 350 square meters,\NCity Hall may poke its nose in.

379
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,000
You're trading business\Npremises for housing...

380
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,760
Can you show me\NMontmorency Villas again?

381
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,040
Same problem.

382
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,680
I have an architect friend...

383
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,560
I'm Thomas Seyr.\NMr. Fox asked me to call.

384
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,440
He told you?

385
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,840
An audition, yes.

386
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,680
Date?

387
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,080
I don't know.

388
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,760
What's available?

389
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,680
I'll hold.

390
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,080
We've made a shortlist.

391
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,640
I forgot something.

392
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,360
Seyr again. We got cut off.\NGo on, I'm listening.

393
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,720
The 23rd? 1 1 o'clock?

394
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,280
Suits me fine.

395
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,600
Where? What's the address?

396
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,360
Are you busy tonight?

397
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,480
Why?

398
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,600
I told Aline we're having dinner.

399
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,560
Again?

400
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,760
She'll believe it if she sees you.\NPick me up from home.

401
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,480
I cross town so you get laid?

402
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,560
Attaboy!

403
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,720
- Who is she?\N- Who cares?

404
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,320
Tell me or I won't come.

405
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,120
The realty chick from uPtown.

406
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,240
- Same as before?\N- The other one.

407
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,880
- I won't do it.\N- Asshole!

408
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,760
- You've come for him?\N- We're running late.

409
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,680
Dinner with a client?

410
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,680
- How've you been?\N- OK.

411
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,800
Will you be out late?

412
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,480
Not very.

413
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,760
- Does he know I'm here?\N- He's on the Phone.

414
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,360
- Fabrice! Tom's here.\N- Coming!

415
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,320
Night, honey.

416
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,720
I won't be late.

417
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,760
Bye.

418
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,760
She suspects something.

419
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,400
She doesn't suspect, in fact...

420
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,920
she's happy I'm with you.

421
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,680
Next time, know what?

422
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,920
We change tactics. You drive me home.

423
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,320
To save me from driving home drunk.\NDig it?

424
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,760
Is that all?

425
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,960
You smug, skirt-chasing smartass!

426
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,120
Don't you have any class?

427
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,120
Don't forget the bank tomorrow.

428
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,200
The loan for the Massy place.\NYou want half, do half the work.

429
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,040
- What time?\N- 1 1.

430
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,960
Horowitz was the magician\Nwho revealed all the piano's magic...

431
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,000
and especially its sparkle.

432
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,040
He had the most\Nmarvelous pianist's hands...

433
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,640
Iike a delicately muscled racehorse.

434
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,680
I can't do it.

435
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,880
Having somebody\Nbehind me puts me off.

436
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,360
I can't take it. It won't work.\NI'm not used to it.

437
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,400
Come over here. Stand here.

438
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,680
Look that way.

439
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,360
Two Jacks on the rocks.

440
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,120
Guess what? Verodin told me\Nhe wants to build on the east side.

441
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,680
He's tight with the lllouz\Nbrothers, so I kePt quiet.

442
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,960
But he came on strong,\N'l want to work with you guys.'

443
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,080
I told him about\Nthe Bussy flour mills.

444
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,720
Guess what? He said he's through\Nwith the lllouz brothers.

445
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,920
He's sick of getting shafted.

446
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,000
That's Number 172,

447
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,960
with the vacant lot.

448
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,760
The homeowner's getting divorced.\NHe'll need dough.

449
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,480
Stick our card in his mailbox,\Nhe'll call us next week.

450
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,560
- That's not my car.\N- It's mine.

451
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,000
If you puke, you go in the trunk.

452
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,600
Stand up!

453
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,400
Is that you?

454
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,480
Who else?

455
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,360
Everything OK?

456
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,680
I am.

457
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,240
I put him there.\NYou want him in the bedroom?

458
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,160
That's fiine.

459
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,680
- Well, I'll...\N- Wait a sec.

460
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,040
Fabrice said he may sell this Place.\NIs it true?

461
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,080
He didn't tell me.

462
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,920
Is business bad?

463
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,520
Not good.

464
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,400
Another drink?

465
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,880
Yeah, OK.

466
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,600
One more and I'll go.

467
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,880
Like this?

468
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,240
Yeah, I know.

469
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,800
Like this?

470
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,160
Excuse me.\NI need to talk to my Partner.

471
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,960
There's a room next door.

472
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,680
Are you trying to screw me?

473
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,200
It's not what we said.

474
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,360
It's not the same Price.

475
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,400
What's my call to Martens worth?

476
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,040
Name a Price.

477
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,520
You're a rat!

478
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,840
Stop right there!

479
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,480
Rats are lazy slobs\Nwho live off other people's work!

480
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,320
You want to redraft the contract\Nand meet with your lawyer?

481
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,520
It's me.

482
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,480
Hi there!

483
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,360
Been out on the town?

484
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,520
I went to a movie.

485
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,800
Which one?\NHungry? They're closing.

486
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,360
I'm OK.

487
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,040
Have a seat.

488
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,680
You've been eating?

489
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,840
What's the matter?

490
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,320
That's odd.

491
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,680
What?

492
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,240
Isn't Fabrice with you?

493
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,040
No, why?

494
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,240
We're eating later but I got hungry.

495
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,400
I skiPPed lunch.

496
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,960
We're meeting with a client uptown...

497
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,480
That's it.

498
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,840
How will you warn him?

499
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,760
Call him on your cell phone\Nfrom the john?

500
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:56,040
'She's here, help!\NWhat do I do?'

501
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,840
How long have you been fooling me?

502
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,000
Fooling you? How?

503
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,520
Skip it.

504
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,280
How long's it been going on?

505
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,520
I dunno.

506
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,840
How can you not know?

507
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,880
Since day one, I guess.

508
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,120
Whenever he says he's going out\Nwith you, he's getting laid?

509
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,560
Listen...

510
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,160
One girl or several?

511
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,600
Gimme a break! I don't fuckin' know.

512
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,480
- You never see them?\N- No, and I don't care!

513
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,680
- Don't care?\N- I don't give a shit.

514
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,560
Why do you do it?

515
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,680
Why I do it?

516
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,280
You wouldn't understand.

517
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,040
Listen...

518
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,600
Aline, wait!

519
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,680
Stay away from me!

520
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,640
Wait!

521
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Fuck off!

522
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,800
Why do I cover for him?

523
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,360
- Because I love you.\N- Get lost.

524
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,800
Did you hear me? I love you!

525
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,800
That's how it is. I want you.

526
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,280
Did you never feel it?

527
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,120
- What?\N- Something between us.

528
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,680
So it's all in my mind?

529
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,880
- Yes.\N- It can't be!

530
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,600
Whenever we meet, we're tongue-tied\Nand shy, like two little kids.

531
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,960
Is that normal?\NAm I making it up?

532
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,080
Honestly, am l?

533
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,360
Idiot.

534
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,640
You know I'm not making it up.

535
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,840
- So, what now?\N- I don't know.

536
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,560
I have to go. He'll be home soon.

537
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,960
What do you care? Stay.

538
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:16,960
Stay.

539
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,080
I can't.

540
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,880
I'm leaving. Let's call each other.

541
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,960
That's good.

542
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,640
God, you're making my day.

543
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:01,160
If you're so damn good, show me.

544
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,240
I Play like that?

545
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,400
No, come off it.

546
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,240
I get it!

547
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,360
Of course!

548
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,320
Move over.

549
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:07,760
Faucet.

550
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,440
And this?

551
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,320
Glass.

552
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,400
Wrong. Cup.

553
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,200
And this?

554
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,240
Matches.

555
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,040
What's this?

556
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,240
Saucepan.

557
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,360
Bad!

558
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:55,080
If you couldn't make the meeting,\Nwhy didn't you call me?

559
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,840
Did you make it to the bank?

560
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,840
You got the files, didn't you?

561
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,520
For fuck's sake...

562
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,040
His secretary's gonna try and catch him.

563
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,520
Anything else you maybe forgot?

564
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,520
- Alright already.\N- What's alright?

565
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,600
I messed up. Nobody died.

566
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,520
- If we lose the Permit, we're fucked.\N- I realize that.

567
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,040
- So what do we do?\N- You got his secretary. What can I do?

568
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,640
Nothing. It's the best thing.

569
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,360
I'm sick of this. Later.

570
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,200
So what's going on? Because...

571
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,920
Nothing.

572
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,200
Nothing?\NYou don't want to tell me?

573
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,880
Tell you what?

574
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,440
Playing piano is making you flip?

575
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,160
Stop it. Now!

576
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,280
Nothing's making me flip.\NI'm not flipping.

577
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,600
I'm having a ball. I feel fantastic!

578
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,560
Don't you see?

579
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,960
It's imPortant. I'm serious about it.

580
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,040
It's wicked.

581
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,840
You gonna make dough from pianos?

582
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,680
Not Pianos. The Piano!

583
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,280
It's not about making money.\NIt's about art.

584
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,360
What's in it for us?

585
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,160
You coming to meetings all mellow?

586
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,840
'Hi guys, I've been playing piano.'

587
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,440
Shit, I'll take up the banjo.

588
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,040
- It's over your head.\N- It isn't at all.

589
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,240
Do what you like to relax after hours.

590
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:19,680
I make balsa models with my kids\Nand I still keep my appointments.

591
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,720
But it's not about appointments.\NYou don't seem on the ball.

592
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,400
Get on the ball, then do what you want.

593
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,320
Collect Panini figures, baseball cards,

594
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,560
do your piano, nobody cares.

595
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,040
Did you tell your dad?

596
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,000
- Yeah.\N- What did he say?

597
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,160
- It grabs him.\N- Grabs him?

598
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,320
It's me.

599
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,640
How's it going?

600
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,160
What are you doing now?

601
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,720
Thinking of me?

602
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,000
All the time?

603
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,640
Think of me all the time.\NI think of you.

604
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,360
I need to see you.

605
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,840
Please!

606
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,600
I've had a shitty day.\NDon't you start.

607
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,040
What are you wearing?

608
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,080
It matters. Pants? A dress?

609
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,280
God, I knew it!

610
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,240
What underneath?

611
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,000
Stockings? Panties?

612
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,960
You don't have to shout. Whisper.

613
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,280
Pantyhose? Any panties?

614
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,720
Do you love me or not?

615
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,320
You love me!

616
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,880
Do you still fuck him?

617
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,920
Do you still fuck Fabrice?

618
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,120
What's wrong with you?

619
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,080
I'm only asking if you fuck.\NYes or no?

620
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,080
You have no right to ask me that.

621
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,480
So that's it!

622
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,400
When you leave me, you fuck him.

623
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,000
He's my husband!

624
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,280
I know. And what am l?

625
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,720
Why not ask me\Nif I fuck someone else?

626
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,080
It's none of my business.

627
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,040
Of course it is, if you love me.

628
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,040
- Do you fuck someone else?\N- Yeah.

629
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,560
You fuck someone else?

630
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,600
Careful!

631
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:54,920
Shut up.

632
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,440
Get off my ass!

633
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,320
I don't understand you!

634
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,320
This is all useless!\NI'm sick of it!

635
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,920
Where? I can't see you.

636
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,480
What bus shelter?

637
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,440
I'm there.

638
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,880
I see you. I'm coming.

639
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,440
Is it bad?\NNeed a hosPital?

640
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,040
Take me home.

641
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:28,640
Get a move on!

642
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,880
Lean forward.

643
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,160
Breathe deeP.

644
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,120
What do you care\Nwhat happened to me?

645
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,080
We're done talking, right?

646
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,040
You gonna sit there all day\Nstaring at me like a mutt?

647
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,680
Suit yourself.\NSee if I care.

648
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,200
Shit!

649
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,000
What's the matter with you?

650
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,120
Stop it!

651
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:23,880
OK, now.

652
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:35,120
I was set to get half the site\Njust by putting up the cash deposit.

653
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:41,920
The site was valued at two million\Nbut easily worth double.

654
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,080
Gently!

655
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,360
That hurt?

656
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,520
- Want another pill?\N- I'm OK.

657
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:54,520
I figured a profit of 2.5 million\Non 300,000...

658
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,560
wasn't bad.

659
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,160
So I put up the cash and we signed.

660
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:07,560
A month later, I heard\Nthe city had blocked the sale

661
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:11,000
so I asked him to pay back my cash.

662
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:15,480
He said sure, Monday, no problem.

663
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,160
Come Monday, zilch.

664
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,600
How long ago was it?

665
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,120
About... three months.

666
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,680
I kePt at him\Nbut he stoPPed taking my calls.

667
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,200
- Socks?\N- Leave them on.

668
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,720
When I heard he was in town,\NI went there.

669
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:36,520
Who is he?

670
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,440
His name is...

671
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,840
Minskov.

672
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,800
You don't know him.\NHe's a Russian.

673
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,720
Where did you find him?

674
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,320
The Riviera, where else?

675
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,360
You don't say.

676
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,200
Can you handle it?

677
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,800
No answer?

678
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,720
What do you expect me to say?

679
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,200
- How's your fiiancee?\N- It's over.

680
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,320
Call me!

681
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:20,040
What happened with my dad?

682
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,840
- That's why you wanted to see me?\N- Not specially.

683
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,480
But I need to know what happened.\NShouldn't I care about him?

684
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:30,720
- No. He's the father, not you.\N- I'm not sure anymore.

685
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,320
Did you walk out?

686
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,040
He dumPed me.

687
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:40,440
Beat me to it by an inch.\NHe'd become a total Pain.

688
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:42,680
Always griping and yelling at me.

689
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,200
You said you had fun.

690
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,480
At first. It wore off.

691
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,760
I'm going to ask you something.

692
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:54,960
Go back to him.

693
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,200
Are you crazy?

694
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,880
Wait, I know what you'll say.

695
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,680
- I say no.\N- Wait.

696
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,440
Think of it as a contract,

697
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,160
Iike a role in a fiilm.

698
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,440
You act.\NI'm the producer, I cough up.

699
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,720
How much do you get as a model?

700
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,760
I'll Pay you the same.\NNo, double! It's worth it.

701
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,520
Just stick with him,

702
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,960
watch what he gets up to.

703
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:25,920
I'll call you twice a day\Nand you'll tell me if he's doing OK.

704
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,240
That's all.

705
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,280
If something goes wrong\Nor he starts acting weird

706
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:32,600
or you lose him,

707
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,000
give me a call.

708
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,160
See? Nothing to it, right?

709
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,520
I'm not a whore, you know.

710
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,240
What do you mean?\NWho says you're a whore?

711
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:46,600
You.

712
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,240
You did. Robert told me.

713
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,760
I'm his son, right?\NCan't expect miracles!

714
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:29,440
I know.

715
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,600
Mr. Minskov, Please.

716
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,640
Did Mr. Minskov go out?

717
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,520
He's in the pool.\NShould I call him?

718
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,240
Don't bother him.

719
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:52,000
St. James Albany Hotel?\NMr. Minskov, please.

720
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,880
It's Personal.

721
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,280
Mr. Minskov?

722
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,080
I'm Mr. Seyr's son.\NYou don't know me...

723
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,240
Don't you sPeak French?

Don't speak French, asshole?\NWhat an asshole!

725

729
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,280
You look pretty glooey!

730
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,640
Listen! Money.\NYou understand that?

731
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,920
Remember Robert Seyr, fuckwit?

732
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,360
Listen, Gloogloo...

733
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,680
Can I talk to you, Miss?

734
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,320
- Hang on, there's a guy...\N- I need to talk.

735
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,520
Lotsa love. See you tomorrow.

736
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,040
Bye-bye.

737
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,680
- What?\N- Minskov owes me money.

738
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,320
What do I care?

739
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,080
- Are those two apes always with him?\N- I'm not talking to you.

740
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,000
You could answer my question!

741
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,360
Hands off!

742
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,200
I just want to meet Minskov.

743
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,040
You're getting boring.

744
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,960
Minskov can droP dead.

745
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,400
Matter of fact,

746
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,960
I just need to call him and you're dead.

747
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:08,480
I get it.

748
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,680
That's why you stay with him.

749
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:17,800
So you can say shit like\N'l call him, you're dead.' What a buzz!

750
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:19,760
I get it.

751
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:23,280
But it's the opposite, right?\NYou're scared shitless.

752
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,440
You're shaking.\NYou have goosebumps.

753
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,840
- Wild, right?\N- You need his permission to breathe.

754
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:30,560
Are you done?

755
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,080
Fuck off.

756
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,800
- It's me.\N- Again? Go away or I'll scream.

757
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,520
- No need to scream.\N- You're a pain!

758
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,960
Tell me one thing.\NI don't understand.

759
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,440
How old are you?\N22, 23, 24?

760
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,360
You're young, not dumb.

761
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:09,360
Why stick with him?\NYou don't even speak Russian.

762
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:15,400
You don't need to.\NHe just fucks you and slaps you around.

763
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:20,440
Forget it.

764
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:23,360
Speak up. I can't hear you.\NWe're all alone.

765
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:25,760
We can't see each other.\NJust say...

766
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,720
Whatever. I'm interested.\NWhat did you do before?

767
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,960
I didn't hear. Say it again.

768
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,600
I said I should stoP...

769
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,600
What are you doing?\NWhere are you?

770
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:45,520
You've moved!

771
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:47,800
What on earth...

772
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:48,960
Make room for me.

773
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,400
Move over!

774
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,080
Here I come!

775
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:59,280
What do you mean,\Nyou only had him on the phone?

776
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,640
What did the bastard come up with?

777
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,360
Dad, you're gonna have\Nto forget your money.

778
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:06,600
Forget it.

779
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,960
Stop thinking about it,\Nstop counting it at night.

780
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,480
Write it off and move on.

781
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,040
Why?

782
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,680
The guy's dangerous.\NHe's a thug, a killer.

783
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:20,120
He's not the lllouz brothers.\NHe's not one of us.

784
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,080
You crossed his path.\NIt was a mistake.

785
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:25,920
Forget it.

786
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:32,240
Hold on.\NWhat did you talk about on the phone?

787
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:34,680
Just bullshit.

788
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,600
Didn't you try anything?

789
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,000
I told you, there's no way.

790
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:45,720
I fucked his girlfriend.

791
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:48,080
You fucked his girlfriend?

792
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,400
I just told you.

793
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:58,720
I ask you to get my money back\Nand all you do is fuck his chick?

794
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,360
I don't believe it.\NYou're turning dumb.

795
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,000
You're turning very dumb.

796
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,160
You there, Dad?

797
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:08,200
She said she'd gone off sex\Nsince they split up.

798
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,120
I thought, no chance.

799
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:13,760
We snort a line in the john.\NLike hitting a magic button. Pow!

800
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,840
She goes sex-crazy.\NGrabs my dick and sucks it.

801
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:19,720
Can't you say excuse me?

802
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:20,600
Sorry.

803
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,160
A real friend!

804
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,800
We went on to her girlfriend's place.

805
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:30,280
Her girlfriend, man!\NWe're at it till 5 AM.

806
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:34,640
I'm seeing her tonight.\NI told Aline I'm eating with you.

807
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:37,680
OK, right.

808
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,440
Don't move.

809
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:55,760
Stay like that.

810
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,880
- What's the matter?\N- Wait, please.

811
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,760
I'm cold.

812
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:02,520
Wait a second.

813
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:14,880
Really?

814
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,520
I'm off.

815
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,120
You think this'll help?

816
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,240
Thanks.

817
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,560

825
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:08,200
You heard me? Verodin's buying!\NHe's leaving tomorrow for two weeks.

826
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:11,880
- It can wait two weeks.\N- It can't. He's waiting to sign now.

827
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,320
Move your foot Please.

What's big about tomorrow?

836
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,960
Does it concern Sami and me?

837
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,800
Go to hell.

838
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,400
What's he up to?

Want to start over?

872
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:51,880
I don't understand it.
