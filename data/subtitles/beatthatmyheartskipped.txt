You knew my dad, right?



He wasn't senile.\NMore of a bossy go-getter.



Then he started to bug me, bigtime.



He bugged me as a whole,\Nbut this was new.



Before, he'd only pretend to consult me.\NHe'd say'Do this'



and I'd do it.



Now he starts asking\Nmy advice on everything,



what I'd do if I were him...



even what I think of him\Nballing his female staff!



I hated it. It grossed me out.



He went on like we were buddies.\NIt drove me nuts!



Then it clicked.\NThis wasn't my dad, here.



He'd become like a kid\Nthat I was responsible for.



Like I was the dad, see?



See what happens?



You wake up one morning\Nand things have switched places.



Gimme a light.



The bitch of it is, you're helpless.



You can scream and kick\Nthe walls, it's no goddamn use.



Time's moved on,\Nyour dad's an old man,



you're not immortal anymore.



Do you believe in God?



Times like that\Nmake you start to believe.



Finally, you learn to put up with it.



Then my dad fell sick and l...



I nursed him like a baby.



Wiped his ass, fed him,\Ncleaned his mouth...



The worst thing was,\NI didn't want it to stop.



The year after that,\NI had my first kid.



THE BEAT THAT MY HEART SKlPPED



I don't see why.



I really don't see why.



I told you about a house\Non Rue Carrel.



On the east side.\NYou didn't mention the west side.



Whichever side,\Nyou knew it was my patch!



Why not the whole region?



You pulled a fast one on me,\Nadmit it.



Can't you kill the sound\Nand your cigar?

In the last six months...\NWho found the warehouses?



Without me, you'd still be\Nhaggling with that old bag.

The acre along the highway.



If you don't remember that,\Nwhat you need is a doctor!



So what's your offer?



I told you, 50-50.



OK, plus half of the Belgrand deal.



Like fuck!\NBelgrand's worth four times Massy!



Don't give me that!



If Massy's worth shit,\Nwhy make such a big deal of it?

Cut it out!



You go that way.



Two floors up.



I can't see!\NGimme a flashlight. You have a spare.

Or his mother?

Go away!



When will you be done?



This part tonight.\NThe rest in two days, minimum.



Thursday?



I'm signing the deal at 1 1 AM.\NGet me the plans by 8.



- I can't.\N- Course you can!



What's the rush?\NWe can beat him down.



He owes Martens 60,000.\NI'll tell Martens to collect.



Why would he?



I know him. He owes me one.



If he finds out,\Nwe'll find ourselves buying from him.



Don't be Paranoid. He won't know.

What's in it for us?



You coming to meetings all mellow?



'Hi guys, I've been playing piano.'



Shit, I'll take up the banjo.

You have no right to ask me that.



So that's it!



When you leave me, you fuck him.



He's my husband!

I was set to get half the site\Njust by putting up the cash deposit.



The site was valued at two million\Nbut easily worth double.



Gently!



That hurt?



- Want another pill?\N- I'm OK.



I figured a profit of 2.5 million\Non 300,000...



wasn't bad.



So I put up the cash and we signed.



A month later, I heard\Nthe city had blocked the sale



so I asked him to pay back my cash.



He said sure, Monday, no problem.



Come Monday, zilch.



How long ago was it?

Did you walk out?



He dumPed me.



Beat me to it by an inch.\NHe'd become a total Pain.



Always griping and yelling at me.



You said you had fun.



At first. It wore off.



I'm going to ask you something.



Go back to him.



Are you crazy?



Wait, I know what you'll say.

You could answer my question!



Hands off!



I just want to meet Minskov.



You're getting boring.



Minskov can droP dead.



Matter of fact,



I just need to call him and you're dead.



I get it.



That's why you stay with him.



So you can say shit like\N'l call him, you're dead.' What a buzz!



I get it.



But it's the opposite, right?\NYou're scared shitless.



You're shaking.\NYou have goosebumps.



- Wild, right?\N- You need his permission to breathe.



Are you done?



Fuck off.
