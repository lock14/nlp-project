1
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,986
Joining me now to talk more about that,

2
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,907
Lieutenant Solomon Goff from
the Esmeralda County Sheriff's Department.

3
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:00,536
Lieutenant Goff, at this hour,
what is going on up at the fire line?

4
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,038
Well, they're just doing
the best they can to put it out.

5
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,834
There's about 450 fire personnel up there

6
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:10,629
and the fire is going
in all different directions. We're...

7
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,289
-You alive in there?
-Almost.

8
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,249
All right. Shake a leg.

9
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,251
Thank you, Spencer.

10
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,754
Well, the beach cities today
are gonna be in the mid-90s.

11
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,715
What a great day to hit the surf.

12
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:59,219
And downtown Los Angeles,
I'm forecasting a cool 102 degrees.

13
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:04,725
And hey, you folks out in the valleys,
get ready for a record-breaking May high...

14
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,185
Stand up.

15
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,314
What'd I tell you about that jersey?

16
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,773
It's clean.

17
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:16,195
-We're not advertising that guy, okay?
-Why not?

18
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,654
'Cause he don't approve of him.

19
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:22,326
-He's, like, 47% from the floor.
-Marcus. Another shirt, please.

20
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,121
Look, Son. We talked about this, right?

21
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,790
We decided to make the jump to Shaq.

22
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,881
Doesn't approve.

23
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,091
What?

24
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,970
What's the rule?

25
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:43,722
I don't know, you got so many.

26
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,141
Have. I have so many.

27
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,728
And let me remind you, not at the table.

28
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,105
It's disrespectful.

29
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:56,235
One, two, three strikes. It's out.

30
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,905
-But Aunt Dorrie gave me this.
-I'll give it back to her.

31
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,086
-I'm changing my name.
-How come?

32
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,421
'Cause I don't wanna be
from this family no more.

33
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,090
Anymore.

34
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,675
What about me?

35
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,802
You're on your own.

36
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:24,346
So you're not going to Aunt Dorrie's
this summer?

37
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,639
I'm going.

38
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:28,183
Am I coming back, is the question.

39
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,562
Who's this?

40
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,163
You think they'll let us swim in their pool?

41
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,880
Never this hot in Oakland.

42
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,674
Oh, stop complaining.

43
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,259
-Come on. Hurry up.
-I'll start unloading.

44
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:05,053
-Coming.
-Okay, yeah. That's great. We're here.

45
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,810
Well, I really like this...

46
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,563
All right.

47
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,775
I can't believe how imprudent you are.

48
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,919
Did an inspector take a look at that?

49
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,630
Yes. It's totally stable.

50
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,550
They're building townhouses
there next year.

51
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:50,724
Can you not be such a grump?
Can you not be such a grump?

52
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,936
You made this possible.

53
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,523
You helped a lot.

54
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,777
This is so great. I love you.

55
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,595
Johnny, my man. How you doing?

56
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,473
-New neighbors?
-Yeah, looks like it.

57
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,517
Did you meet them yet?

58
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,061
You wanna give people a chance
to settle in, you know?

59
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,438
I'll wait till the movers leave.

60
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,733
How much you think they paid?

61
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:46,571
I don't know, man.
Hell of a lot more than I did 20 years ago.

62
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,283
Still the best investment. Up, up, up.

63
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,661
When you're right, you're right.

64
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,830
Have a good one.

65
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,408
You'll make it, you have plenty of time.

66
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,452
Well, the pilot's already checked in.

67
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,163
And I don't mind driving you to the airport.

68
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,499
You might look good in a Prius.

69
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:24,586
That man won't mind driving me either,
and I'm willing to tip him.

70
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,546
-Okay.
-Bye.

71
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,466
-Chris.
-Harold.

72
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,260
-Always a pleasure.
-Yeah.

73
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,513
-You check in.
-Okay.

74
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,057
Let us know how things are going.

75
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,392
You know how your mother gets.

76
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,106
What a shame he lives 400 miles away.

77
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,076
-It makes me sad.
-Yeah. Yeah.

78
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,954
-You gonna cry?
-Can he move in?

79
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,998
Come on. Come, come, come.

80
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,805
What the...

81
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,808
What is that?

82
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,477
I don't know.

83
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:30,277
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
That's my only Prada.

84
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,487
What?

85
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,745
That's better.

86
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,873
-He's got security lights.
-Who does?

87
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,792
Whoever, next door.

88
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,255
He's got one on a pole in the back.

89
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,425
I told you we should've
put sheets on the windows.

90
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,303
Sheets? We need bricks.

91
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,057
-Hey, babe?
-Yeah?

92
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,603
I look okay?

93
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,563
lt's gonna be a hundred
and something degrees.

94
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:10,775
I know, but l can't do this in just a shirt.
They'll think it's rude.

95
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,611
Oh, is that where you're gonna put the...

96
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:17,490
Yes, it is, because l like this space
and l'm the one that's here all day long.

97
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,909
-Okay?
-Perfect.

98
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,705
So l'll call you, like, 2:00-ish.

99
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,206
You're okay driving the truck back?

100
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,125
Oh, gosh, l don't know.

101
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,919
Maybe if you showed me
where the key goes in the little...

102
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,714
l'll show you where the key in the...

103
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,554
-l gotta go.
-Okay. Break legs.

104
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,931
-Hey.
-Yeah.

105
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,725
We're homeowners.

106
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,314
Sweetie, your bag.

107
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,316
Babe?

108
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,234
What the...

109
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,154
-Here you go.
-l got a ticket.

110
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,448
Yeah, well, you are hanging out a little bit.

111
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:01,409
Well... So what?
Are we living in Bel Air or something?

112
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,953
Sweetheart, it's not filled out. Look.

113
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,540
"Welcome to Lakeview, neighbor.
Observe all parking regulations."

114
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,750
"A.T."

115
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,012
Look at you, making nice-nice.

116
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,431
Oh, gosh. A little cop humor.

117
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,434
He's here to protect and serve us.

118
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,313
Maybe we can borrow his handcuffs.

119
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,773
l like that.

120
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,401
-Hey, we can go over tonight and say hello.
-Okay.

121
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,736
-Don't work too hard.
-Never.

122
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,915
Out of here. Yo, chief!

123
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,167
Let's roll, man. Five-O. Come on!

124
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,378
Let's get out of here, man.

125
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,556
Clarence Darlington, hold! Don't run.
Hey, hey! Don't make us chase you.

126
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,683
Nobody say nothing.

127
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,767
Shit!

128
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,062
Come here. Front and center, let's go.
Right here.

129
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,274
Some French Connection bullshit.

130
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,985
Watch your mouth. Come on, on the car.

131
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,573
Pulling this shit on me?
ln front of my people?

132
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,576
-l would never do that to you, dawg.
-This is for your benefit, man.

133
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,495
Now it looks like you fought
the law and the law won.

134
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,788
You can go back and be the man,

135
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,540
instead of the crack-dealing
little snitch that you are.

136
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,793
Forget the circumstance.
Shit's disrespectful to a brother.

137
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,754
Brother? Clarence, we ain't brothers.

138
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,131
We didn't even crawl out of
the same evolutionary pool.

139
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,925
What are you, anyway?
You know, l always wondered about that.

140
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,511
You a Euro-Mexi-Japa-Chine-stani or what?

141
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,680
You don't even know, do you?
Ain't got a clue.

142
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,265
-Watch yourself.
-You're a weed, that's what you are.

143
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,267
A junkyard weed.

144
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,935
Spray your ass with some Roundup.

145
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,645
l'm 1/7th Cherokee, bitch!

146
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,399
Yeah, and the other 93% wigger.
Can you do the math on that, dumb ass?

147
00:12:56,484 --> 00:13:00,987
You got problems, man. Seriously.
This shit aside, you don't see straight.

148
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,782
What you got for me, Clarence?

149
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,994
Give me something other than
this fake-ass Vanilla lce impression.

150
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:12,248
l know who popped that kid on Palm Grove.
Leontro Wilson.

151
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,250
He's running with a crew up
in the Baldwin Village.

152
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,461
-You got an address?
-What?

153
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,839
You're the sworn officer.
Go knock on some doors and shit.

154
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,133
-Are we done? l got quotas, too.
-Hold, hold, hold, hold.

155
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,426
One thing. One thing.

156
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:27,305
You get to stay in business
as long as you're useful, okay?

157
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,642
-All right, man, you told me.
-Oh, and one other thing.

158
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,311
No more little girls.
l don't wanna see that shit.

159
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,021
Baby ain't too little for me.

160
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:39,776
Just 'cause they don't scream when you
use them doesn't mean they're not little.

161
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,569
You understand me?

162
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,571
Now bounce.

163
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,241
Prick.

164
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,993
Watch your ass, big guy.

165
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,186
Give me your wallet.
Give up the wallet, man. Give it up!

166
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,105
-Oh, shit.
-Come on, hurry up! Give it up!

167
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,190
And turn that shit down!

168
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,235
God damn it.

169
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,613
Boy, you got a lot to learn.

170
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,822
What?

171
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,911
Never roll your window down
when somebody does that.

172
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,663
No matter where you are, Chris.

173
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:21,336
-You scared the hell out of me.
-Well, how else you gonna learn?

174
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,297
-Abel Turner.
-Hey. Yeah, Chris...

175
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,423
Mattson.

176
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,759
Yeah. l was meaning to come over.

177
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:31,262
-You got a lot on your hands.
-Yeah, well, you know, moving and...

178
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,264
-lt's very stressful, you know?
-Yeah.

179
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:37,560
But you got your mad beats
and your blunt here to help you chill out.

180
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,439
Oh, it's just a cigarette. Organic.

181
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,192
Okay. Not against the law yet.

182
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,362
Well, it is in my house.

183
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,489
l hear you.

184
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,492
So are you a SoCal boy, Chris?

185
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:53,785
Chicago.

186
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:58,623
Went to Berkeley on a lacrosse scholarship.
Stayed there after college.

187
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,376
-Doing what?
-l work for Good.

188
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,463
Oh, the enemy of evil.
You a superhero there, Chris?

189
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,133
No, the supermarket chain. Yeah.

190
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,970
They're expanding down here,
so we talked it over...

191
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,638
-You and your wife?
-Yeah, Lisa.

192
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,307
-ls she from Chicago, too?
-No, she's from up there.

193
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,976
-Berkeley.
-Oakland.

194
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,353
Oak-town girl, all right!

195
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,105
Kind of, like, opposites attract.

196
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:25,358
Well, no, not exactly.
We actually have a lot in common.

197
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,110
Yeah? Like what?

198
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,612
Well...

199
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,030
Rap music.

200
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,116
Well, l like it, she doesn't.

201
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,659
lmagine that.

202
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,619
Yeah.

203
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,454
Yeah, well, l'm going to finish my rounds.

204
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,124
You know, l do a little neighborhood patrol
every night, you know?

205
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,208
Oh. Cool.

206
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,336
-Welcome. Good to have you.
-Thanks, yeah. Nice to meet you.

207
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,671
All right.

208
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,756
Say, you know,

209
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,343
you can listen to that noise all night long,

210
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:56,264
but when you wake up in the morning,
you'll still be white.

211
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,489
-There you are.
-Hi.

212
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,824
How's the water?

213
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,868
Amazing.

214
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,413
-How was your day?
-Awesome.

215
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,916
So l met our new neighbor.

216
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,960
A.T. Abel Turner.

217
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,295
And?

218
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,633
He has a very special brand of humor.

219
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,593
So he was joking.

220
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,847
-Yeah.
-Did you ask him about the lights?

221
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,391
Wasn't the best time.

222
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,729
-l always wanted to say this.
-What?

223
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,023
"Honey, l'm homeowner."

224
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,609
-No, that's really bad.
-No, it's good.

225
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,985
No, it's bad.

226
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,072
But l'm gonna kiss you and make it better.

227
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,040
-What are you doing?
-Move over.

228
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,252
Time to christen the pool.

229
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,879
-We can't.
-Come on.

230
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,715
lt's our house.

231
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,554
Hurry up and get in the pool.

232
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,478
You're gonna go to hell.

233
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,564
-l am not.
-Yes, you are.

234
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:20,491
God's gonna send you down there
with a stiffy and everyone's gonna laugh.

235
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,118
Man, you told me to look.

236
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,412
You were dumb enough to do it.

237
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,832
Get off me!

238
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,584
Marcus? Celia?

239
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,505
Don't say anything.

240
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,717
What the hell is going on up here?
You're supposed to be looking out for him.

241
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,677
l wasn't doing nothing.

242
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,596
Marcus, hey, hey, hey.

243
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,723
l wasn't doing what?

244
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,392
Anything. l wasn't doing anything.

245
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,562
What the hell are you fighting...

246
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,259
Look, why don't you guys wash up?

247
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:24,972
Let's go downstairs and have some
big bowls of ice cream. Okay?

248
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,658
Babe?

249
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,827
Can l ask you a question?

250
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,375
This house has three bedrooms, right?

251
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,255
And there's two of us.

252
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,049
So, you know, like,

253
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:03,803
how many offices or dens,

254
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:08,224
whatever-type rooms,
does one need, really?

255
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,017
Well, we could...

256
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:16,023
l always wanted a sewing room for me.

257
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,943
Sewing.

258
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,780
Come on, we'll, you know...

259
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,115
No.

260
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,367
No, l don't know.

261
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:31,956
l mean, l know that we could turn one
of those rooms into a nursery...

262
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,125
-No.
-...if we wanted to.

263
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,086
Or not.

264
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:41,924
Lis, come on, we've talked about this.
We'll get around to it. lt's just...

265
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:48,014
Right now, we don't know
how any of this is gonna play out.

266
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:53,894
Okay. l just think that there are
really good reasons to not wait.

267
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,439
-No, you're right.
-ln fact, to do this right now.

268
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,441
-No, l...
-You know?

269
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:02,903
Like, l'm not only thinking about us.
l'm thinking about our families.

270
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,782
l think that our families
would really benefit from...

271
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,285
l know, l know, l know, l know.

272
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,082
Are you hot?

273
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,918
No. Are you kidding?

274
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:26,427
No.

275
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,436
lt isn't working.

276
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,775
Here you go.

277
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,610
Why is it so loose?

278
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,280
Probably forgot to screw it back in.

279
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,832
The joys of home ownership.

280
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,919
What's that?

281
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:13,265
lt's a good image for
an antismoking campaign.

282
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,315
You've gotta be kidding me.

283
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,779
l'll talk to him tomorrow.

284
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,698
Mr. Turner.

285
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,576
You can call me Abel.

286
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,578
Morning.

287
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,122
Getting your miles in?

288
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,498
Before it gets too hot.

289
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,042
Or before l talk myself out of it.

290
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,462
Yeah, l hear you on that.

291
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,215
Need a hand?

292
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,093
Matter of fact, l do.

293
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,474
Trying to reach this bolt down
here behind the battery.

294
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,477
l need you to hold it this way, just pull it.

295
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,561
There you go.

296
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,104
-Come on.
-l got it.

297
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,857
You all right?

298
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,277
-Yeah, just...
-Let's see.

299
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,863
Oh, yeah, you're not bleeding too bad.

300
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,948
-lt's all right.
-You're a tough guy.

301
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,201
Must have some lrish in you.

302
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,119
Black lrish, probably.

303
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:06,086
Hey, you didn't see anyone around
the side of our house last night, did you?

304
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,714
Something happen?

305
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,551
Lisa's a little paranoid.

306
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,803
Got an alarm system, right?

307
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:18,098
Yeah, it's kind of wonky.

308
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,350
You might want to get that fixed.

309
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:22,770
You know, you got a woman
you wanna try and protect.

310
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:26,565
Well, you know, this is stupid,

311
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,611
but your outside lights over here...

312
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,239
What about them?

313
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,700
They're shining right into our upstairs.

314
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,870
l see how that could be annoying.

315
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,498
Just till we get some curtains up.

316
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:49,004
You know the arroyo back here
that runs along everybody's house?

317
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,715
There's some
unsavory characters down there.

318
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,637
You know, kids with nothing to do.
They tag stuff, vandalize.

319
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,430
-Been some break-ins.
-ls that right?

320
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:01,725
l got a teenage daughter who likes to
sneak out at night if l don't stay on top of it.

321
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,519
-You know what l mean?
-l hear you.

322
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:08,107
l bet you don't want them shining down
on your pool deck at night, either.

323
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,234
l guess not.

324
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,861
Celia, Marcus.

325
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:16,782
This is Mr. Mattson.
He's the man on the other side of the fence.

326
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,325
-Say hi.
-Hi.

327
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,913
-All right. See you, guys.
-Bye, Dad.

328
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,503
Thanks for your time.

329
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,433
-Okay, get out of the way. Move.
-No, don't kick the ball.

330
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,684
Move!

331
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,980
You're stupid! What'd you do that for?

332
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,898
Now the lady's coming.

333
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,445
Hello?

334
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,363
Hey.

335
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,410
She did it.

336
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,039
Come get it.

337
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:11,170
-Dad never let us over here.
-Why not?

338
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,505
He don't want us being freeloaders.

339
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,466
That's a good thing to not be.

340
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,010
You don't even know what a freeloader is.

341
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,054
Somebody that can swim in this pool.

342
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,848
Well, you guys can swim here
anytime you want.

343
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:25,476
-You just need to ask your parents.
-Parent.

344
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,061
Our mom died.

345
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:30,731
l'm sorry.

346
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,777
-So it's just you guys and your dad?
-Yeah.

347
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,112
But he has enough rules for two people.

348
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:40,699
Yeah, well, that's how dads are.
lt'll get better as you get older.

349
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,951
No. He will never change his mind.

350
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:46,538
What he says is what goes,
and the more you argue, the more he's like,

351
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,916
"Excuse me? l am the law."

352
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,128
Anyways, l like your hair.

353
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,507
Thank you. l'm Lisa.

354
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,092
Celia.

355
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,302
-And you are?
-l'm Marcus.

356
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,720
Nice to meet you.

357
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,598
-So, Celia, can you do me a favor?
-Sure.

358
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,184
My husband and l are having
a housewarming party here on Friday

359
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:11,313
and l would love it if you and your dad
and Marcus all came over

360
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,981
so we could kind of get acquainted.

361
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,150
You don't have to invite Marcus.

362
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,944
She already did.

363
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,572
So l'll see you Friday.

364
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,157
-Okay.
-Yes.

365
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,409
Okay.

366
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,327
Nice to meet you guys.

367
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,537
-Bye.
-Bye.

368
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,746
Bye.

369
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,103
Okay, okay, okay.

370
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,316
-Hey.
-Hello there.

371
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,484
Late night?

372
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:01,196
Well, you know, big town.
A lot of people to suck up to.

373
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,366
So, honey, these are...

374
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:08,162
Did you talk to him about the lights?

375
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,999
Yeah. He's gonna take care of it.

376
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,670
-l'm gonna go talk to him.
-No, l'll do it. Here, let me.

377
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,882
-No, because you...
-Let me handle it. Please.

378
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,385
-Okay.
-All right.

379
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:25,888
Be nice.

380
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,224
-l am nice.
-And don't be all...

381
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,852
You know, 'cause he's...

382
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,187
What?

383
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,523
'Cause he's a brother.

384
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,234
He's your brother? l didn't know that.

385
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,404
Chris.

386
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,461
Jesus.

387
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:11,558
Chris, what's up?

388
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,976
Hey, Abel.

389
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,437
Your lights?

390
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:19,274
You know, l did not get to that today.

391
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,444
Can't you just turn them off?

392
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,446
No. You know, they're on a master timer

393
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,157
with the rest of the outdoor lights,
sprinklers.

394
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:31,161
l'd have to do that whole instruction
manual thing, you know?

395
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,664
-Right.
-There's no excuse, you know.

396
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,833
l just had a hell of a day.

397
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,501
No, l know what you mean.

398
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,169
Want a beer?

399
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,754
No. Thanks.

400
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,589
But...

401
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,676
You'll...

402
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,682
Thanks.

403
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,894
Chris, wait. Hold it.

404
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,939
Be right with you, wait a minute. All right?

405
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,793
Let me take you on patrol with me,
show you the neighborhood.

406
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,044
Okay.

407
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,675
Sure the neighbors appreciate this.

408
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:30,554
Well, not everybody up here's
somebody you wanna live next to.

409
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,680
Like who?

410
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,056
This guy here, for instance.

411
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:36,435
Sakorsky, Sakwasky, whatever.
Beats on his wife.

412
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,938
l told her to come straight to me, but...

413
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,399
You know, she didn't have to live that way.

414
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,525
Did she...

415
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,944
Well, other people's relationships.

416
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,988
You think somebody
shouldn't be with somebody,

417
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:51,366
but you can't say that to their face,
now can you?

418
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:53,952
Yup.

419
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:58,707
Over here, now, got some dealing going on,
l think, you know?

420
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:03,211
Pills, weed, maybe a little coke, meth.
A lot of coming and going.

421
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,340
lnteresting thing is

422
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:10,552
guy's got a different car
in the driveway every week.

423
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,764
Maybe he's a car dealer.

424
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,981
So what'd they tell you about the hillside?

425
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,775
Behind the house?

426
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,903
Said there was a slide 1 0 years ago,

427
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:32,449
county reinforced it, and now they're
clearing it out for condos or whatever.

428
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:35,494
Yeah. Hope they knew what they were doing.

429
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:40,165
Look, Abel, we're here. Okay?

430
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,793
And we're counting
on being here a few years.

431
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:45,504
We really want this to be our home.

432
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,632
-Raise your family?
-Yeah, eventually.

433
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,801
Don't wanna rush it, though, right?

434
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,886
Whenever we decide, that's our choice.

435
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,638
You and your wife?

436
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,598
Who else's would it be?

437
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,936
lt's a brave new world.

438
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,813
How's that?

439
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,858
You know, l got nothing against you. Or her.

440
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:11,613
LAPD. l work with all kinds.
l'd lay my life down for those guys.

441
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,449
-"All kinds?"
-But that's where l work.

442
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,618
This is where l live.

443
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,998
l'm trying to raise these kids by myself.

444
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:24,251
Teach them to respect themselves
and the people they come from.

445
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,836
So l don't need you or your lady

446
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,839
putting your bedroom scenes
out here for them to see.

447
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:34,011
l don't think they're ever going to forget that
little synchronized swimming exhibition.

448
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,470
Me, either.

449
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,347
Look, Abel, l'm sorry. l...

450
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,267
Maybe there's places where that's okay.

451
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,103
And maybe that's where you ought to live.

452
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,790
Hey.

453
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,962
They saw us. Last night.

454
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,883
-What do you mean?
-ln the pool.

455
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,052
Him, the kids...

456
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:18,513
Oh, my God. l'm mortified.

457
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:22,517
Well, l don't think he likes us anyway.

458
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,728
Well, honey,
it's not the best first impression.

459
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:29,775
No, l mean, l don't think he likes
the idea of us together as a couple.

460
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,153
Did he say that?

461
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,989
ln so many words.

462
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:39,826
-Then why would you say that?
-Because l just know.

463
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:45,415
lt's not like your dad's my biggest fan.

464
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,376
Okay. There's a leap.

465
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:52,130
No, l... Just something l picked up on.

466
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:55,175
-Because your parents are perfect.
-My parents love you.

467
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:59,763
Oh, yeah, they must, because they say it
to my face every time they see me.

468
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,099
That's a little harsh.

469
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,392
Come on, we said we wouldn't do this,
remember?

470
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,728
You are making assumptions about this guy.
You don't even know him.

471
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,314
l just walked around
the entire neighborhood with the guy.

472
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,774
l think l know him better than you do.

473
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,859
Chris, you don't know him.

474
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,237
-Oh, come on.
-You don't.

475
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,446
-You're right.
-Whatever.

476
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,241
No, look. You're right.

477
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,411
l don't know him.

478
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,039
Guess l never will.

479
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,794
-l'm off to bed.
-Okay.

480
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,673
He's still not gonna shut off the lights.

481
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,532
Lis, where's your bathroom?

482
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,826
Down the hall, to the right.

483
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,581
l'll get it.

484
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,503
-Abel.
-Chris, hey.

485
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,922
Welcome. Nice jacket.

486
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,841
Yeah, l like it.

487
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,510
Mr. Turner, l'm Lisa, Chris' wife.

488
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,137
Abel, please.

489
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,682
And where are your kids?

490
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,601
They could not come.

491
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,228
-l'll take a drink, though.
-Okay.

492
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,355
Right this way. What are you having?

493
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,481
Anything wet.

494
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:34,900
Well, we have a lot of that.

495
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,027
-Wet and cold.
-Okay.

496
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,072
-Hey, Chris.
-What?

497
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,949
You hit the total jackpot, man.

498
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,076
l so want to date a black girl.

499
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,246
l'm working my way up, though,
doing the Pacific Rim thing right now,

500
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,665
if you get what l mean.

501
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,792
Well, good luck with that.

502
00:36:57,089 --> 00:37:00,050
You know, l heard something
on the news about fires.

503
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,802
-Where?
-Around Santa Clarita.

504
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,847
-lt's global warming.
-Totally. This is not even normal.

505
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,390
Yeah. We gotta study the problem further.

506
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,893
Don't wanna jump to conclusions.
Wouldn't be right.

507
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,312
He's right. lt wouldn't be right.

508
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,813
Code red. Blue state.

509
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,107
A hundred-something degrees?

510
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,401
lt's snowing at the South Pole.

511
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,487
And it's hot in Africa.

512
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,075
What? l just mean that's normal, right?

513
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:32,082
Anyway, there is an awful lot of
evidence piling up, so...

514
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,584
That something you studied up
at Berkeley, Chris?

515
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,045
No, Abel, just something l'm interested in.

516
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,421
Oh, so you're not an expert?

517
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,132
l mean, you work for, like,
a grocery store chain

518
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,426
or something like that, right?

519
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,972
Yeah, with a pretty strong
environmental agenda.

520
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:50,725
Timeout. Debate over.
l don't even know what that means.

521
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:58,275
-Well, what do you do, Abel?
-l am a police officer.

522
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,277
-Oh, you are?
-Yes, sir.

523
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,404
Well, Chris, hide the pot.

524
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,115
Not the pot l'm worried about.

525
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:10,120
lt's those cigarette butts he keeps
flicking over the fence so the wife won't see.

526
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,331
Dude, you're so busted.

527
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:15,917
Really?

528
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,671
Where do you patrol, Abel?

529
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,924
l'm assigned to
the Valley Bureau of the LAPD,

530
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,634
over near Panorama City.

531
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,511
You know where that is?

532
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:27,971
Yes. l think.

533
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,431
Been there?

534
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,933
-Never been.
-Come on down.

535
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,810
We'll show you some things.

536
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,353
Like how to be an asshole.

537
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,481
l'm sorry,
is there something you wanna say?

538
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,607
No.

539
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,319
But you seem to have an opinion about
law enforcement. l'd like to hear it.

540
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,321
-Oh, let's talk about something else.
-Oh, no, no, no.

541
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,530
We could talk about something else,

542
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:48,908
but l think your friends
wanna talk about this.

543
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,872
l just find that there's an attitude.

544
00:38:56,208 --> 00:39:01,171
You know, a kind of aggressiveness
when you deal with them.

545
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,839
Which l can certainly understand.

546
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,591
l'm sorry, Miss...

547
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,301
-Eden.
-Eden.

548
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:10,347
Well, Eden, when you're getting
jacked outside your loft

549
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,391
and Dubya here doesn't have

550
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,853
the energy to stop it,

551
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,856
we'll see about sending
the nice police over to help you.

552
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,150
That's if it's not too late.

553
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,946
-Oh, what is this?
-White zinfandel.

554
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:30,158
-lt's very refreshing.
-Oh, good.

555
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:33,203
Well, it's getting late.

556
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,663
Chris, Lisa, thanks for inviting me.

557
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,707
lt's been enlightening.

558
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,085
Night, all.

559
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,047
Don't drink and drive.

560
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,304
What time is it?

561
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,891
Yeah, let's go.

562
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,643
That's fresh dill.

563
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,562
Abel, hold on.

564
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:04,984
Look, the cigarettes, l'm sorry.
l wasn't thinking. l apologize.

565
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,404
But in front of my wife?

566
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,989
That's really not cool.

567
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,158
You didn't like that?

568
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,701
No, l didn't.

569
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,205
And whatever it is about me,
or us, that bothers you,

570
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:20,083
we gotta figure out a way to deal with this.
All right?

571
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,293
So, what do you propose?

572
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,380
-What?
-What's your agenda?

573
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,674
My agenda is...

574
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,427
Can't we all just get along?

575
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,638
Oh, not Rodney King.
You playing the race card?

576
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:38,101
Come on, man, this is getting a little
out of hand, l mean...

577
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,602
l need you to back off.

578
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,979
Back off?

579
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,440
Yeah, a little.

580
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:46,025
Or what?

581
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,987
See, you keep saying stuff like that.

582
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:52,323
Like we're not welcome here,
we should move.

583
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,950
But we're fitting in just fine.

584
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:55,493
Says who?

585
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,038
Maybe you're the one with the problem.

586
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,624
-l don't smoke.
-You know what?

587
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,711
l said l was sorry. Just stay out of my life.

588
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,213
Stay out of your life?

589
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:21,394
You have a good night, Chris.

590
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,421
Jesus...

591
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:51,257
What is it with this neighborhood?

592
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:55,470
lt's like they hate us.

593
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,769
Oh, honey? ls that the Prius?

594
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,191
Honey, do you see anything?

595
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,193
No. Hit the lights.

596
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,486
Okay.

597
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,448
Hey, babe? Did you leave this door open?

598
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,243
No.

599
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,206
Oh, shit.

600
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,124
The tires are flat.

601
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:28,044
They're slashed.

602
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,004
Shit.

603
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:33,550
-What are you...
-Move, move.

604
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:38,513
Chris! Chris, what are you doing?

605
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,640
God damn it.

606
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,728
Well, whoever it is, they're gone.

607
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,897
Everything okay over there?

608
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,987
l thought l heard somebody moving
around over there.

609
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,155
Did you see anyone?

610
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,615
No.

611
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,867
l just see you.

612
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:05,331
So you're just not gonna
do anything about it?

613
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,418
l'm sorry, ma'am,
there's just not much we can do.

614
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:11,963
Abel, Officer Turner,
he said he heard some noises.

615
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,340
Sounded like somebody moving
along the side of your house.

616
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,592
l'm sure he did.

617
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,595
Well, you get some late-night traffic
from the arroyo back there.

618
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,764
Bunch of kids with nothing better to do
than make other people's lives miserable.

619
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,267
Yeah, l keep hearing about them.

620
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,521
That's not much
of a lock on that door there.

621
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,274
But we'll take a swing around,
you know, see what we see.

622
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,526
lt wasn't kids in the arroyo.

623
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,195
Then what was it?

624
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:44,203
Well, if you hear any other noises, ma'am,
l'm sorry, just give us a call, okay?

625
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:47,707
You guys are lucky.
You have a cop living next door.

626
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:52,003
Thank you, Officer.
Thank you for all your help.

627
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,506
-Thanks, guys, for coming out.
-Hey, we can come on back.

628
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,091
Stay alert out there, all right?

629
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,594
l guess we could dust for prints.

630
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,525
Honey, next time, use an ashtray.

631
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,489
How do you even know it's mine?

632
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:29,540
-Do you have any proof?
-Not exactly.

633
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,669
But he told us we weren't welcome in
the neighborhood. That's what he told me.

634
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,087
He refused to turn off his floodlights,

635
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:37,423
he's made these implications
about Lisa and me,

636
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,843
and he was standing right there
after the whole car tire thing, just waiting.

637
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,304
Honey, do you have any proof?

638
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:50,186
Chris just answered that, Daddy.
No. No, not exactly, but...

639
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,355
The way it seems to me,

640
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:55,775
the man never made an actual threat
against your life or property.

641
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,568
So it's his word against yours.

642
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,947
And he has, let's say,
the color issue on his side.

643
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:04,617
And that color happens to be blue.

644
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:08,830
As for the lights, you could file a civil suit.

645
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:10,456
l wouldn't advise it.

646
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,292
These things have a knack
for turning out badly.

647
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,711
Yeah, but why do we
have to be the ones to...

648
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:17,296
That was my professional opinion.

649
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,674
What's the point of carrying on with this?

650
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:23,136
You bought this as a starter home.
Fine, you started.

651
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,806
Put it back on the market.
You take a loss, so what?

652
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:31,894
Then you can do what we wanted you to do,
which is let us help you.

653
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,730
Harold, do you think you
could just have the courtesy

654
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:36,524
of including me in the conversation?

655
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:45,116
Are you going to have children?

656
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,034
What?

657
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,329
Daddy, that's not what we came here
to talk to you about.

658
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:54,083
Chris wants me to address him.
This is what's on my mind.

659
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:59,046
You plan to have children
with my daughter?

660
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,423
Yes, l do.

661
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:02,175
We do. l do. Yes.

662
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:05,344
How do you intend to protect them?

663
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:08,181
How am l going to protect them?

664
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,896
Well, l'm gonna get a gun, Harold.

665
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:19,066
l'm going to amass an arsenal.
A lot of firepower.

666
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,986
How's that work for you?

667
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,740
Excuse me for a moment.

668
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,837
Wow, look at that.

669
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:45,051
-lt's worse than this morning.
-Yeah, l know.

670
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,806
Are we gonna talk about this at all?

671
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,641
What?

672
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:56,979
Oh, well.
There's a 1 0-day grace period on firearms,

673
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,856
so l got lights.

674
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:06,322
And do we think that this is the right thing
to do to solve the problem?

675
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,825
Oh, l don't think it's gonna solve anything.

676
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:11,619
But l'm gonna enjoy the shit out of it.

677
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:15,331
Okay. Let me know if you need any help.

678
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,541
Okay.

679
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,370
Man, l am so totally burnt right now.

680
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:57,164
-Late night?
-Yeah, Connie kept me up.

681
00:47:57,249 --> 00:48:00,084
Yeah, l seem to remember
something like that.

682
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:03,337
No, it's she wants out of Boyle Heights.

683
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,214
You know, she's right, man.

684
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:09,135
You can't be living around
the people you got to be arresting.

685
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,762
Wife ever bust your chops
about moving up?

686
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:12,930
-Jocelyn?
-Yeah.

687
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:16,976
Never gave her a chance, man.
l was busting my hump for her.

688
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:22,899
Eight years of double shifts,
all the overtime l could drag down,

689
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:27,111
extra security jobs, taking all the shit details
nobody else wanted.

690
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,864
l grew up in South Central.

691
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:32,366
There's no way
l was gonna raise my kids there.

692
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:36,162
Now's the time to get out, you know.
They'll be gone before you know it.

693
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,497
lt's the perfect opportunity.

694
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,918
-That's why l'm taking the exam.
-What exam's that?

695
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,628
Detective exam.

696
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:48,382
Get off the street, bump up a pay grade.
About 1 5 years, and l'm out.

697
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:52,136
'Cause l don't really wanna be
doing this stuff when l'm...

698
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:55,181
l just don't love the job the way you do.

699
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:01,812
Unit 51, we have a 4-15 in progress.
Male suspect, possible shots fired.

700
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:04,231
137 South Oxford Street.

701
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,776
Pop the siren, detective sergeant.

702
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,778
Unit 51 , 1 0-4.

703
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,031
About time.

704
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:16,744
Who called the cops?

705
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:20,373
He's got his wife and his little girl in there,
yelling about how he gonna kill them both.

706
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:23,125
-Have any weapons?
-Yeah, yeah, l think he's got a gun.

707
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,753
He didn't open the door
and l wasn't staying to find out.

708
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:28,381
Okay, what apartment number is it?

709
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:31,425
Apartment seven.
Straight back in the corner.

710
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,052
-Left?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right.

711
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,721
-What's his name?
-Damon Richards.

712
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,725
-Keep these people back.
-All right.

713
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,401
Get inside.

714
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,158
What? l'm poor, okay! What? Look at me!

715
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,160
Trying to say you're better than me now?

716
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,662
l'm not talking about my baby!

717
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:02,873
-You know what? Forget him and you!
-Please hurry.

718
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:06,252
You can take this damn baby away!
l don't need it!

719
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,047
Both of you!
You're just a strain on my finances.

720
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:12,091
LAPD, Mr. Richards.

721
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,844
-Man, get away from my door!
-Listen, my name is Abel.

722
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:18,014
l wanna know if your wife
and child are safe, okay?

723
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,891
Man, don't worry about them!
Get away from my door!

724
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:23,352
Listen, Damon, let's talk about this.

725
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,187
Man, we ain't gonna talk about nothing!

726
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:28,107
We can play this any way you want, okay?

727
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,359
Let's just keep talking, all right?

728
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,695
Make sure everything is cool inside,
all right?

729
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:33,946
Gun!

730
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:38,409
-Oh, my baby.
-You okay?

731
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,618
No!

732
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:41,370
-Damon! Stop!
-Everything's gonna be okay.

733
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,122
-Just stay there.
-Officer, wait! Please don't hurt him!

734
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,874
-Stop!
-He's a good guy!

735
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,542
Our guy's on the ground!
He's out the window!

736
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:49,628
-Call for backup!
-Hey! Stay back! Sit down!

737
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,047
-No! No!
-Stay back!

738
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,674
-Please! Please, just let him go, Officer.
-Unit 51 requesting assistance.

739
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:54,967
Man with a gun.

740
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:15,696
Give it up, Damon! Come on, give it up!

741
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:21,118
Stop, Damon! Stop right there!
Put the gun down! End of the line! Hold it!

742
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:23,913
Don't come closer! Don't come closer!

743
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,331
l swear to God I'll do it!

744
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,916
Okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay.

745
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,417
-Don't come closer!
-Let's talk about this, all right?

746
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:29,752
-Calm down, calm down, calm down.
-I'll do it!

747
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:31,504
-Take it easy. Take it easy, okay?
-l'll do it. l'll do it!

748
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:34,840
We can talk about this. All right?
There you go.

749
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,343
-What are you doing?
-Now stop bullshitting.

750
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,427
You wanna do this, do it.

751
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:41,931
Come on, stop playing. Stop bullshitting.
Go ahead, do it! Do it!

752
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:43,849
Come on! What, you need some help?

753
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,143
-Move your finger. Move your finger!
-No! No!

754
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,312
Give me the goddamn gun then!

755
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,980
Up! Get up!

756
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:54,485
Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes!

757
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,654
ls this gonna happen again?

758
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:57,780
-No!
-What?

759
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:00,407
No, sir! No! l swear to God, no!

760
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,118
God ain't here, you swear to me.

761
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,036
l swear. l swear to you, sir!

762
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:08,332
Now, you be a man, understand?
You take your responsibility.

763
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:13,003
l don't give a shit what your situation is!
You be a father to that baby, you got me?

764
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,255
Abel!

765
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:15,881
lf l have to come back here,

766
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,008
l'm gonna be the one doing the shooting,
you understand?

767
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,343
Yes, sir.

768
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,220
-Detective Villareal.
-Yes, sir.

769
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,931
Put some restraints on this young man.

770
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:27,393
-But do it gently, please.
-Absolutely.

771
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:35,151
You heard him. Come on.
Let's go. Come on!

772
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,014
Hey.

773
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,433
What are you doing?

774
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:08,851
You said any time.

775
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:13,189
Yeah, if your dad said it was okay, Celia.
l have a feeling he didn't.

776
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:23,866
-How old are you?
-Fifteen.

777
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,202
You're a very brave girl.

778
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,704
Make sure you ask
your dad next time, okay?

779
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,414
Yeah. Right.

780
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,711
Hey, can l ask you a question?

781
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,047
Sure.

782
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,758
-You got me.
-So, in school there's a lot of hooking up.

783
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,051
Okay.

784
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,887
And if a black guy goes out
with a white girl,

785
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,223
his boys are like, "Dawg, you the shit."

786
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:48,349
Right.

787
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:52,561
But other way around and they're on you.
"Sister" this, "sister" that.

788
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:55,564
-ls that what's going on with you?
-There's this guy.

789
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:56,899
And you like him?

790
00:53:56,983 --> 00:54:00,152
Well, it depends.
How much do l have to like him?

791
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:07,159
Well, if he's gonna be your boyfriend
you should probably really like him.

792
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:10,663
Especially if he's white,
because it may not be easy.

793
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:16,460
But you like who you like, right?

794
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:18,337
-Yeah.
-All right.

795
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:21,757
-Hey, what is this?
-Destiny's Child.

796
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:26,720
-Okay. l think l've heard this.
-You think?

797
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,266
lt's nice. l like it.

798
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:34,019
No, l think l gotta move to this. Wait.

799
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:37,273
Oh, my gosh! l feel so old.

800
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:49,576
-Come on, take it.
-No!

801
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:52,288
You can shuffle around a little bit.

802
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,622
Sure.

803
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:57,084
Come on. You're not old.
You'll get it. Come on.

804
00:54:57,168 --> 00:55:00,045
No. No, no, no.
You are doing fine for the both of us.

805
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,380
Come on!

806
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:05,384
Oh, my gosh, you're a great dancer.

807
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,303
-Come on, get down to it. Come on.
-No way!

808
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:10,806
No! No. Absolutely not. l'm not doing that.

809
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,351
-Remember this one?
-Who taught you that?

810
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:16,812
-What do you know about that?
-My mom did. My mom taught me that.

811
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:19,815
-Oh, my God. l feel so old.
-Come on!

812
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:22,818
Did l give you permission
to come over here?

813
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,029
Abel.

814
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:27,031
Answer me, young lady.

815
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:31,327
No, l'm just...

816
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:34,955
No, l did not give you, my daughter,
permission to come over here

817
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,041
because it matters to me
what you're learning

818
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,334
and who you're learning it from.

819
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,127
Okay, l told her she could come over

820
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:42,463
-and swim whenever she wanted to.
-Oh, so what l say doesn't matter.

821
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:43,797
That's not what l meant, Abel.

822
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:46,091
No, no, no, no, no.
l understand where you're coming from.

823
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:50,304
l need to be fresh and liberal

824
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:52,890
and open to what other people think and do,
is that right, Lisa?

825
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:55,267
-That's right.
-Okay. All right, then.

826
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:58,312
Well, let's all get crazy.
Let's just get down then, huh?

827
00:55:58,396 --> 00:55:59,730
-What are you doing?
-Forget the rules, huh?

828
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:01,315
-There are no rules.
-Abel...

829
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:04,443
We make them up as we go along,
is that right, Lisa? l am right, aren't l?

830
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:05,819
You've made your point, Abel.

831
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:08,030
Whatever we wanna do,
that's all right, right?

832
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,948
-That's enough.
-How you say it, baby girl?

833
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,117
-Listen, you made your point.
-Let's get ill! This is sick!

834
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:15,829
-Okay, Dad! All right!
-This is dope! Let's keep it gangsta! Holla!

835
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,122
What?

836
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:21,293
lt's okay for you to parade around
in your underwear, but not me, huh?

837
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,711
You know what that is?

838
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,713
That's hypocrisy. That's a double standard.

839
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,882
There's no room
in this world for that anymore.

840
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,050
Didn't you teach her that, Lisa?

841
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,510
l mean, you did teach her everything
you know, right?

842
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:31,720
-No.
-She knows a shitload more than you do.

843
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,680
-Okay, Celia...
-l beg your pardon?

844
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:35,432
Stop messing with my life!

845
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:38,143
Telling me what to do,
what to say, what to wear!

846
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,979
You don't know anything about me,
who l am or what l think.

847
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,691
You're just an old man with a badge on
and his pants off.

848
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:51,532
Okay, Abel, that is not okay.

849
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:53,033
l'm sorry.

850
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:57,996
l'm not myself these days.
You know, l'm not sleeping very well.

851
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,456
You have no right to hit her.

852
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:04,586
Oh, let's you and me have a long discussion
about my parental rights, why don't we?

853
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,296
Get off my property.

854
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,840
Or what?

855
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,343
You wanna call the cops?

856
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,929
Here. l'll tell you who's on duty.

857
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:05,939
You okay? You're not eating.

858
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:09,276
My stomach's been funny all day.

859
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,195
You getting the flu?

860
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,365
Just tension.

861
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:25,876
Maybe he finally got the message.
No lights tonight.

862
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,922
lt's nice out here.

863
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:34,343
This place is gonna look really sweet
by the time we're done with it.

864
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:38,013
Just about when we're ready
to put it back on the market.

865
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,936
l'm sensing a theme here.

866
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:48,273
Be honest with me.
You wanna sell this place?

867
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,900
Do you?

868
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:53,946
Why, l certainly don't want
anyone else deciding that for us.

869
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:58,116
Not the guy next door. Not your father.

870
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,536
They're not the same person, Chris.

871
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,788
And you don't have to prove anything
to either one of them.

872
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,414
Come on, l know that. Why wouldn't l...

873
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:07,543
Okay, we'll just let that be your own
little transference deal.

874
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:10,879
-We won't actually talk about that, l guess.
-What?

875
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,047
That's what you think this is?

876
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,132
Oh, don't get all "l know..."

877
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:17,844
Come on, you know exactly
what l'm talking about. Don't do this.

878
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:21,598
l am constantly taking shit from
black guys about our relationship.

879
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,350
"Constantly."

880
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:26,061
Constantly?

881
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:28,230
Okay. Whatever. Lisa...

882
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:33,610
lt just gets exhausting
being on the front lines all the time.

883
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:41,076
You have no idea.

884
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,744
What does that mean?

885
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:46,832
l'm just gonna go upstairs
and lie down and read my book, okay?

886
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,450
Everything meet with your approval?

887
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,827
You always did keep the place neat.

888
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:26,830
Just don't seem to enjoy it much anymore.

889
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:31,668
You just said something nice to me, right?
l mean, sort of?

890
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,421
Hey, baby. You got everything?

891
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:37,299
Yup. l'm gonna ride
the horse this year, Aunt Dorrie.

892
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:40,427
-Are you asking or telling?
-Asking.

893
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:43,347
Well, then l think we can manage that.

894
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:46,892
-Giddyup, partner. And have fun, okay?
-Okay.

895
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:52,314
Don't l get a goodbye?

896
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:54,066
See you.

897
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:55,817
Can we go?

898
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:03,950
So, what was all that about?

899
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:07,329
l don't know. She's 1 5 and female.
You tell me.

900
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:09,289
Here.

901
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,332
You can give this back to her

902
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:13,835
if you want her walking around
like a zombie child for the next two weeks.

903
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,797
What is going on with you, Abel?
l mean, you seemed like you were fine.

904
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:19,675
Now all of a sudden, l don't know,
you seem different.

905
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:23,679
l am fine, and l've always been different.
Never been better.

906
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,349
See you, guys. Have fun.

907
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:37,984
You okay in there?

908
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,455
l'm pregnant.

909
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,919
-You sure?
-Yeah.

910
01:01:57,588 --> 01:01:59,297
l did three of them.

911
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,343
Should we call, or...

912
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:06,680
What about your pills?

913
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:09,933
l might have missed a few. Maybe.

914
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:12,602
Well, either you did or you didn't.

915
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:15,272
l did. Okay?

916
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,275
So... l did.

917
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:20,193
l thought we were gonna wait.

918
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:22,237
You don't always get
to choose this kind of thing, Chris.

919
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:23,780
Yeah, you do, that's sort of the point.

920
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:27,534
Come on, you choose to take birth control,

921
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:28,910
you can read the label and...

922
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,580
-Come on, we had a plan.
-Our plan was to start a family.

923
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:34,583
l can't believe you're not even
just a little bit happy about this.

924
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:37,252
-Oh, come on, that's not fair.
-Well, you know, l didn't...

925
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:38,754
This is not some sort of sneak attack.

926
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,381
Right now,
you want to start a family right now?

927
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:42,758
Right now? We just moved in!

928
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:46,678
-l'm sorry. ls it not convenient for you?
-Oh, God! No, come on!

929
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,514
lt's not about convenience.
lt's a whole different life, you know?

930
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,685
And what life is that, Chris?
The one where you're not married to me?

931
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,896
Come on, Lisa, that's not...

932
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:05,322
l gotta go to work. l'm late.

933
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:09,534
Bye.

934
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:23,006
What's going on, Captain?

935
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:25,634
Damon Richards. You know him?

936
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:27,219
And you are?

937
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:31,431
This is Bronson and Morgada. They're...

938
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:33,058
lnternal Affairs.

939
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:36,603
Yeah. lt's just a procedural thing, Abel.

940
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,022
So, what about Richards?

941
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:43,235
We arrested him last week.
He took two shots at me and my partner.

942
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:45,612
He's bringing a suit against the department.

943
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:48,114
Brutality charges, violation of civil rights,

944
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:50,033
as well as a personnel complaint
against you.

945
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:53,495
"Officer Turner used excessive force,
made threats against..."

946
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:56,039
l gave that asshole a pass, Cap.
He took two shots at us.

947
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:59,251
You were verbally abusive
and you left him with three broken ribs.

948
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:00,919
Not to mention shoving a gun in his face.

949
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,712
That is not accurate.

950
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:06,424
l talked to him.
l tried to educate the individual.

951
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,260
l never struck him.

952
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:11,638
lf he was injured, that happened
when he was out of our custody.

953
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:14,975
Look, this is all bullshit, Abel.

954
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:20,105
But this is what
we have to deal with now, right?

955
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:24,025
So finish your tour today,

956
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:27,904
then take some time off
in lieu of disciplinary action.

957
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:29,281
All right?

958
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:32,409
-How much time?
-Until we tell you otherwise.

959
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:34,744
Because, you know, frankly,
over the last few years,

960
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:37,289
you have a number of question marks
on your record.

961
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:38,540
So l wouldn't push it.

962
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:42,294
You should be thinking retirement.
lt's about that time.

963
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:47,215
28 years. 28 years and this is what I get?

964
01:04:48,509 --> 01:04:50,802
What do you think you deserve?

965
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:11,281
Heads up, heads up.

966
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:15,076
-Don't stop on my account.
-You don't wanna hear it, Abel.

967
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:18,580
-l heard nigger jokes before.
-No, it's not that.

968
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:22,459
We're throwing a bachelor party
for Davis tonight.

969
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:24,461
-And l'm not invited?
-Yeah, sure you are.

970
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:27,047
We just thought that, you know, it wasn't...

971
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:29,424
We thought it's not your thing.

972
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:38,683
Tell you what,
why don't you bring it to my house, okay?

973
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:41,269
No civilians, you can cut loose all night.

974
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:42,687
What about the kids?

975
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:46,566
They're doing their two-week bit
with my sister-in-law out in Lancaster.

976
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:48,443
-Perfect timing.
-You really want to?

977
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:52,739
My reputation's on the line here.
Besides, l need a good lap dance.

978
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:56,409
-All right, let's do it.
-Now we got a place.

979
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:57,661
We got a place.

980
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:48,253
What's going on?

981
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:53,216
-Nothing.
-Babe, do you hear this?

982
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:13,945
-l don't believe this.
-What time is it?

983
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:23,079
lt's, like, 3:00 in the morning.

984
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:25,665
-Where are you going?
-To tell them to shut up!

985
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:28,460
No, you're not... Lisa, wait. Wait!

986
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:29,836
No.

987
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,172
-Wait! Wait, wait.
-No.

988
01:07:32,256 --> 01:07:34,549
-Look, please.
-Hey, let go of me.

989
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:36,301
l'll deal with it.

990
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:38,470
Oh, this you wanna deal with, right?

991
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:41,222
The macho bullshit. This you can handle.

992
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:42,766
Don't start.

993
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:53,443
-Open the front door, man. Open it!
-l got it.

994
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:54,569
Yeah?

995
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:56,905
Hey, can you ask Abel to come to the door?

996
01:07:56,989 --> 01:08:00,492
-What's the problem?
-Well, we're trying to sleep.

997
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:03,328
We're trying to get hammered, asshole.

998
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:20,470
-Hey, man!
-What's up?

999
01:08:23,682 --> 01:08:26,935
Hey, there you guys are, man.
What happened to you?

1000
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:32,440
Hey! Who put you on the VlP list?

1001
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:33,525
Abel, what are you doing?

1002
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,110
lt's 3:00 in the morning,
we're trying to sleep.

1003
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:37,946
Come on, Chris. l'm glad you came over,
we can bury the hatchet.

1004
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,030
Let's get you a drink.

1005
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:42,325
Fellows!
This is my next door neighbor, Chris.

1006
01:08:42,409 --> 01:08:46,246
As you can see, he is a Democrat.

1007
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,415
Hey, we're not biased here.

1008
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:54,045
You can hug as many
and any tree you want. All right?

1009
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,672
Here you go.

1010
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:04,597
Fellow cop's getting hitched.

1011
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:07,433
Condemned man's last meal,
you know the deal, right?

1012
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:08,601
Oh, hey, congratulations.

1013
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:11,396
Now can you just turn
the goddamn music down?

1014
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,939
ls it disturbing you?

1015
01:09:13,023 --> 01:09:15,024
Come on, it's practically
breaking the fricking windows.

1016
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:18,236
l bet you can't even
hear yourselves screw, huh?

1017
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:23,867
Chris here got himself a little dark
meat over there, you know?

1018
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:25,994
You know, you need to be careful, neighbor.

1019
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:28,955
You might not be enough man for her.

1020
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,916
Just busting your balls.

1021
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:35,420
You know what they say,
"Once you go black..."

1022
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:38,089
-"You never go back."
-There you go!

1023
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:42,594
Besides, you don't wanna
piss these guys off, do you?

1024
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:45,388
Look at that! That's something, isn't it?

1025
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:47,015
l'm massively aroused.

1026
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:49,684
Oh, see, there you go.
You're doing that Berkeley thing again.

1027
01:09:49,768 --> 01:09:52,312
You're saying one thing,
but you mean another.

1028
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:54,522
That's irony, right?

1029
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:55,857
l don't know. l don't know.

1030
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:59,277
You don't know?
lf you went to Stanford you'd know.

1031
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:01,863
Oh, come on, man, lighten up.

1032
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:04,866
Look, look.
As soon as we get through with the groom,

1033
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:07,410
we'll turn the music down, you go home,
you get some sleep, all right?

1034
01:10:07,494 --> 01:10:09,287
Bring him in here, yeah!

1035
01:10:10,414 --> 01:10:12,457
Bring him in here, guys!

1036
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:19,923
-Put it on him, put it on him, put it on him!
-Show these cops.

1037
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:21,758
Come on, now!

1038
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:24,719
Hit him in the face with them!
Beat him in the face with those things!

1039
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:26,346
Come on, now!

1040
01:10:26,972 --> 01:10:28,181
Kim!

1041
01:10:29,808 --> 01:10:32,018
Come on, now, give it up!

1042
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:40,610
-Thank you.
-Oh, shut up. Come with me.

1043
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,822
-Are you bad?
-Take it down!

1044
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,241
Now, look...

1045
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,913
Don't let him get away! No, no!

1046
01:10:51,997 --> 01:10:53,414
Now we talking! Now we talking!

1047
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:54,582
Get off me!

1048
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:58,002
Grind it on him, baby. Put it on him!
Put it on him!

1049
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:08,012
Be careful now, he's a married man!

1050
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,181
He doesn't look so married to me.

1051
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:15,436
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Let him up, let him up! Let him up!

1052
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:23,736
Nice pair, huh, Chris?
Little bit better than Lisa's, though, right?

1053
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:27,323
You do not wanna do that. Believe me.

1054
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:28,992
-Get him out of here.
-Get off me.

1055
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:31,869
lt's a grown man's
playground over here, Chris.

1056
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,162
Tell the wife good night!

1057
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:35,248
Oh, shit! Bring those strippers back here.

1058
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:36,541
Come on, don't let her stop!

1059
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:41,045
No, now's the time. Put them titties out.
Break those titties out on him, baby!

1060
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,215
Yeah, right there! Right there.

1061
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:48,011
Hey.

1062
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:52,682
Babe, what are you doing?

1063
01:11:52,766 --> 01:11:54,434
Where's my goddamn camcorder?

1064
01:11:54,518 --> 01:11:55,643
Why?

1065
01:11:57,396 --> 01:12:02,483
l've gotta record everything
that bastard does.

1066
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:03,735
Chris.

1067
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:05,320
l'm gonna take away his job...

1068
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:06,696
Honey.

1069
01:12:07,239 --> 01:12:08,364
Pension...

1070
01:12:09,074 --> 01:12:12,243
-His house...
-Honey, what happened over there?

1071
01:12:13,203 --> 01:12:15,204
God. You didn't forget.

1072
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:18,249
-What?
-You didn't forget!

1073
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:20,543
-You stopped taking them!
-What are you talking about?

1074
01:12:20,627 --> 01:12:22,462
Your pills! What, you had to trick me?

1075
01:12:22,546 --> 01:12:25,006
That's the kind of marriage you want? Fine!

1076
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:28,760
l didn't stop taking them,
l just missed a few days, and then l...

1077
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:29,969
l didn't do it on purpose!

1078
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:33,306
Oh, really?
'Cause l find that hard to believe!

1079
01:12:35,559 --> 01:12:38,186
-l don't even know who you are.
-l'm your wife.

1080
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:42,148
Are you?
'Cause l don't even recognize you anymore!

1081
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:49,614
Where is that damn thing?

1082
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:59,540
A number of wildfires
are raging out of control

1083
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:02,085
and have so far burned 2500 acres

1084
01:13:02,169 --> 01:13:07,298
and destroyed 185 homes
and businesses all around the Southland.

1085
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:09,926
The governor has declared
a state of emergency

1086
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:12,428
in six counties in Southern California.

1087
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:15,890
Forty thousand people have been
evacuated in the declared areas.

1088
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:17,350
Everything is just so hard.

1089
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:20,561
l mean, no one want to lose any houses,
much less their own.

1090
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:25,066
Right now two additional fire teams
are gearing up to hit the lines tonight.

1091
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:28,319
We are joined right now
by Metro fire chief Greg Malio.

1092
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:32,156
-Greg, thanks for being with us.
-You're welcome, Pamela.

1093
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,625
Be careful now, he's a married man!

1094
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:27,128
He doesn't look so married to me.

1095
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:32,717
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Let him up, let him up! Let him up!

1096
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:08,252
That's great, guys.
Just put them all along the wall.

1097
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:11,130
Why are we doing this?

1098
01:15:12,382 --> 01:15:14,759
lt's good for the environment.

1099
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:19,430
Trees make oxygen.

1100
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:39,492
Well, you certainly don't look pregnant.

1101
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:45,790
That must make you happy.

1102
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,294
What's going on, Lis?

1103
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:53,589
l'm sorry.

1104
01:15:55,467 --> 01:15:57,260
l just can't stand this.

1105
01:15:57,344 --> 01:16:01,305
l hate my job. l'm not even getting paid.

1106
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,724
-Then quit.
-And do what?

1107
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:08,437
l hate this neighborhood. l miss my family.

1108
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:11,023
Look, we knew it was gonna be hard.

1109
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:13,609
Maybe not this hard.
But we agreed that we'd...

1110
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:16,946
No, l agreed to do whatever you wanted

1111
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:19,949
because l thought that we were
moving toward something.

1112
01:16:20,033 --> 01:16:21,075
We are.

1113
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:24,745
lt's your idea about what all this
is supposed to look like.

1114
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:29,292
-We just need to get used to this.
-"We" are now all three of us.

1115
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:36,299
l really need you to start thinking that way.

1116
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:47,018
l'll do whatever it takes to make you happy.

1117
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:49,895
That is all l have ever wanted.

1118
01:16:56,194 --> 01:16:58,112
Hey. Hey!

1119
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:00,489
Hey!

1120
01:17:00,574 --> 01:17:04,702
Hey! What are you...
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1121
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:07,997
-What? l can't hear you!
-Turn that goddamn thing off!

1122
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:10,666
-Abel, what's wrong with you?
-Turn it off and put it down!

1123
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:13,419
Now, you didn't ask my permission
to plant these trees.

1124
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:15,087
But they're hanging over on my property,

1125
01:17:15,172 --> 01:17:17,673
so l don't need your permission
to cut them down.

1126
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:19,216
Oh, come on!

1127
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:21,135
Turn that goddamn thing off!

1128
01:17:21,219 --> 01:17:23,179
You wanna shut
that mouthy bitch of yours up?

1129
01:17:23,263 --> 01:17:24,764
She can say whatever she wants, asshole.

1130
01:17:24,848 --> 01:17:27,475
Or what? You wanna come over here
and get busy, Chris? Come on!

1131
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:29,226
Come on over. Let's do something.

1132
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:30,936
Abel, come on, turn it off!

1133
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:32,521
Shut it off, my ass.

1134
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:33,856
What is wrong with you?

1135
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:36,734
Come on over.
Oh, you want her to be the man now?

1136
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:39,570
-Shut up!
-Come on. Bring it on over here. Come on.

1137
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:41,656
Come on, player, come on! Come on!
Come on, then.

1138
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:44,659
-That's what you want? Think you're bad?
-Yeah, yeah! Yeah, that's right, l'm bad!

1139
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:47,161
Yeah, put your little saw down!
What do you got now, buddy?

1140
01:17:47,245 --> 01:17:50,748
Stop it. Honey. Honey! Honey! Hey! Stop it!

1141
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:53,000
Stop it!

1142
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:55,503
You like that, huh? Lisa, back up!

1143
01:17:55,587 --> 01:17:57,880
-Have you lost your mind, Chris?
-Lisa, get off.

1144
01:17:57,964 --> 01:17:59,632
-Stop it! Stop it!
-Get off of me!

1145
01:17:59,716 --> 01:18:00,841
Come on!

1146
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:04,095
Chris, stop it! Have you lost your mind?

1147
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:06,347
Real tough now, huh?

1148
01:18:06,431 --> 01:18:08,724
Oh, shut up. Put the saw down and let's see.
Let's go! Come on!

1149
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:11,060
Come on over here. Come on!

1150
01:18:12,062 --> 01:18:13,729
There you go.

1151
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:19,735
Run on in the house. Pussy. Sugar britches.

1152
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,654
-Prick.
-That's right!

1153
01:18:22,489 --> 01:18:26,617
Plant something else over there,
see if l don't cut that down, too!

1154
01:18:36,461 --> 01:18:39,046
The flames are advancing quickly
in the hills surrounding

1155
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:41,340
four counties in Southern California.

1156
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:42,883
ln a moment, we're gonna talk about

1157
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:45,511
the drought conditions
across much of the country.

1158
01:18:45,595 --> 01:18:47,471
But first, we're gonna go
to where they're paying

1159
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:50,307
a big price for tinderbox conditions.

1160
01:18:51,351 --> 01:18:53,144
Hot enough for you?

1161
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:55,396
l could use another 50 degrees.

1162
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,648
-Anything else?
-No, l'm good. Thanks.

1163
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:00,860
-Well, welcome to the neighborhood.
-Thank you.

1164
01:19:04,614 --> 01:19:06,574
People here are describing
the harrowing scene

1165
01:19:06,658 --> 01:19:08,033
as they grabbed whatever they could

1166
01:19:08,118 --> 01:19:11,579
of their precious possessions
and fled for their lives.

1167
01:19:11,663 --> 01:19:13,748
As the fires roared out of control,

1168
01:19:13,832 --> 01:19:17,293
fanned by 65-mile-per-hour
Santa Ana winds...

1169
01:19:19,337 --> 01:19:22,047
Damn. l was trying to get away from you.

1170
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:27,178
Hey, hey, hey, hey. lt's okay.

1171
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:29,930
She's got a big old 1 2-gauge back there.
Nothing's gonna jump off.

1172
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:31,599
Nope. Had my drink.

1173
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:34,977
There's no need in you rushing home.
Lisa's not back yet.

1174
01:19:35,061 --> 01:19:37,021
That kind of woman,
you gotta let her cool off for a while.

1175
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:40,608
Abel, Abel. Abel.
l don't care what you have to say.

1176
01:19:40,692 --> 01:19:43,027
l don't care what you think.

1177
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:47,364
Just save it, all right?
All your poisonous race crap.

1178
01:19:48,533 --> 01:19:50,367
Okay. You know what?

1179
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:56,123
Wasn't a good day for me.
Shit got a little out of hand. My bad.

1180
01:19:58,126 --> 01:19:59,794
Sweetheart, bring me my regular

1181
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:01,962
and give him another
whatever it was he was having on me.

1182
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:03,881
Okay? All right?

1183
01:20:13,266 --> 01:20:15,684
-There you go, darling.
-Thank you, baby.

1184
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:16,769
Here you go.

1185
01:20:16,853 --> 01:20:19,897
Look at that shit. Headed right for us, huh?

1186
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:26,570
You know what today is?

1187
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:29,865
No, how would you know?

1188
01:20:33,745 --> 01:20:37,164
Today's the third anniversary
of my wife's death.

1189
01:20:42,462 --> 01:20:47,550
When Marcus went back to school,
she became a home-care aide.

1190
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:49,593
Mostly old people.

1191
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:53,180
Alzheimer's patients, stroke victims.

1192
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:57,518
l don't know how in the hell she did it,

1193
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:03,190
but it made me kind of glad that
that's what she did, you know?

1194
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:07,778
Sort of, you know, balanced things out,
you know?

1195
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:10,030
How's that?

1196
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:13,367
Well, you know,
because of what l do on my job.

1197
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:22,459
Three years ago to the day,

1198
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:24,962
l get a phone call.

1199
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:28,382
My wife's been in a head-on collision.

1200
01:21:28,466 --> 01:21:31,635
Some guy high off his ass,

1201
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:35,556
going 90 miles an hour
the wrong way on the 1 01 just...

1202
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:44,315
They took her to Hollywood Memorial.

1203
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:46,692
She died on a gurney in the hall

1204
01:21:46,776 --> 01:21:52,239
because somebody forgot to tell them
she was the wife of a police officer,

1205
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:54,909
so they treated her by pigmentation.

1206
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:59,830
-How do you know that?
-Because l know things.

1207
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:04,335
Well, l'm sorry.

1208
01:22:06,796 --> 01:22:08,255
Thing is,

1209
01:22:11,509 --> 01:22:15,262
what l been trying to figure out
for three years to this day

1210
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:18,766
is why she was with her employer,

1211
01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:22,645
who took a steering column
through the chest, by the way.

1212
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:26,190
Where were they going
or coming from, Chris?

1213
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:29,610
My wife and her white boss?

1214
01:22:29,694 --> 01:22:32,696
ln the middle of the afternoon on the 1 01

1215
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:37,409
when she should have been changing
some old Jew's Depends down on Fairfax.

1216
01:22:38,703 --> 01:22:41,288
That really what
you wanna think about today?

1217
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:44,458
-Wouldn't you?
-No, l wouldn't.

1218
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:48,462
And why you telling me this?
What does this have to do with me?

1219
01:22:48,922 --> 01:22:50,089
Nothing.

1220
01:22:50,173 --> 01:22:52,716
Except you and your little chocolate drop

1221
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:56,303
picked the wrong time to move
and the wrong place.

1222
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:01,350
Whatever, Abel.

1223
01:23:01,434 --> 01:23:05,062
See, there you go.
You white boys always say that. "Whatever."

1224
01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:09,233
And then you go ahead
and just do your shit anyway.

1225
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:11,568
What's that supposed to mean?

1226
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:16,740
That you think you can take
whatever you want.

1227
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:20,953
And l hate that. l hate it!
That's what it means!

1228
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:26,750
Hey, sorry, sweetheart.

1229
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:30,129
We just having a heart-to-heart here.
Right, Chris?

1230
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:35,676
You know what, Abel?

1231
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:37,803
Fuck you.

1232
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:41,181
ls that a "we are the world" fuck you?

1233
01:23:41,725 --> 01:23:44,977
No. lt's a special one, just for you.

1234
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:47,938
You've earned it.

1235
01:23:49,607 --> 01:23:51,233
We're not moving.

1236
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,527
"Whatever."

1237
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:27,936
They said it's under control.

1238
01:24:30,356 --> 01:24:32,983
Yeah, well, let's get this over with.

1239
01:24:34,652 --> 01:24:36,904
-Then what?
-l don't know.

1240
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:03,097
We feel safe with Abel across the street

1241
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:05,766
because there are very bad people out there.

1242
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:07,851
People who steal and shoot you.

1243
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:10,687
But we have a black policeman living here.

1244
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:13,941
-Yes, it's very comforting.
-Annabelle, you leaving?

1245
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:16,735
Hey, hey, hey. Abel's famous cornbread.

1246
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:19,113
Where's Celia and Marcus?

1247
01:25:19,197 --> 01:25:21,448
lt's their week to spend
with my sister-in-law.

1248
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:23,784
Hi, Lisa. How are you?

1249
01:25:24,828 --> 01:25:28,789
They're probably out there sharing tales
about what a hard-ass their dad is.

1250
01:25:28,873 --> 01:25:31,625
They're gonna be grateful
for the rules one day.

1251
01:25:31,709 --> 01:25:35,796
Yeah, l keep telling them that,
but l don't think they believe me.

1252
01:25:58,027 --> 01:25:59,153
Fellows.

1253
01:25:59,237 --> 01:26:02,781
Hey, what's the word, Abel?
Are we gonna be okay down here?

1254
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:05,617
Yeah. You know,
they'll stop it at the firebreak.

1255
01:26:05,702 --> 01:26:07,870
Never get through the pass.

1256
01:26:08,454 --> 01:26:10,289
Chris, how you doing?

1257
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:12,082
Good.

1258
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:14,751
Got his game face on. Who's winning?

1259
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:16,461
Johnny and Chris right now.

1260
01:26:16,546 --> 01:26:18,755
All right, well, l got next.

1261
01:26:19,215 --> 01:26:20,299
Great.

1262
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:42,529
Hope this is not Division.

1263
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:45,532
-Turner here.
-lt's Darlington.

1264
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:47,826
-Yeah.
-l'm in the crib, homey.

1265
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:51,580
Nice shot.

1266
01:26:51,664 --> 01:26:53,665
All right, do your thing.

1267
01:26:55,585 --> 01:26:56,960
Nice shot.

1268
01:27:09,807 --> 01:27:12,142
Ain't nobody bitch, you prick!

1269
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:21,860
Babe, l'm just really... l think l should go.

1270
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:24,446
You sure? You want me to go?

1271
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:25,989
No, it's fine.

1272
01:27:26,366 --> 01:27:29,243
You accepted the invite, you should stay.

1273
01:27:29,327 --> 01:27:30,786
All right.

1274
01:27:31,788 --> 01:27:34,456
-l'll be home in a bit.
-All right.

1275
01:27:59,148 --> 01:28:00,732
Come on. Pick up.

1276
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:14,913
-What's up?
-Get out of the house now.

1277
01:28:14,998 --> 01:28:16,623
The wife is on the way home.

1278
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:17,749
You said they were away.

1279
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:20,544
Bail your big ass out of there right now.

1280
01:28:24,674 --> 01:28:25,799
Shit.

1281
01:28:58,249 --> 01:28:59,624
Chris?

1282
01:29:02,211 --> 01:29:03,545
Be nice.

1283
01:29:03,629 --> 01:29:05,547
-Calm down.
-Jesus.

1284
01:29:07,425 --> 01:29:09,176
No! Stop!

1285
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:14,431
What is that? ls that mine?

1286
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:16,892
l'll check on it. Wait. Wait.

1287
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:25,859
That is mine.

1288
01:29:25,943 --> 01:29:27,277
Calm down.

1289
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:30,614
Just hold still!

1290
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:34,117
No! No!

1291
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:36,286
Will you just calm down?

1292
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:41,708
-Chris. Wait!
-Shit!

1293
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:43,251
-Chris!
-What?

1294
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:45,545
-Stay there!
-lt's my wife!

1295
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:54,513
Lisa?

1296
01:29:55,181 --> 01:29:56,681
Yo, playa!

1297
01:29:57,141 --> 01:29:58,475
What's up, man?

1298
01:29:59,102 --> 01:30:00,977
What the hell, dude? Come on.

1299
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:03,105
Hey, what are you...

1300
01:30:15,785 --> 01:30:18,370
Lisa?

1301
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:22,791
God damn it.

1302
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:25,710
Oh, shit. No, no, no, no. Baby.

1303
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:27,212
Don't touch her.

1304
01:30:27,296 --> 01:30:29,423
This is Officer Abel Turner
with the Valley Bureau.

1305
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:32,843
I need a black and white and an
ambulance at 1100 Lakeview Circle.

1306
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:35,178
10-53, possible head trauma.

1307
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:37,431
-Don't move her!
-Look, l'm trying to see if she's alive!

1308
01:30:37,515 --> 01:30:41,184
Just talk to her.
Keep her calm till the paramedics come.

1309
01:30:45,648 --> 01:30:46,940
Oh, Jesus.

1310
01:30:47,024 --> 01:30:50,527
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God, you're okay.

1311
01:30:51,195 --> 01:30:54,739
You're okay. You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

1312
01:30:55,241 --> 01:30:58,410
Come on.
Shit, where's your goddamn phone?

1313
01:30:58,494 --> 01:31:00,996
-Abel.
-Jesus Christ!

1314
01:31:05,376 --> 01:31:08,253
Everything's under control.
The ambulance is on its way.

1315
01:31:08,337 --> 01:31:10,213
-You all right?
-Fine.

1316
01:31:17,013 --> 01:31:22,058
Dr. Cohen, 6931 . Dr. Cohen, 6931 .

1317
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:27,230
Mr. Mattson? The doctor will see you now.

1318
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:28,940
Okay, thanks.

1319
01:31:39,785 --> 01:31:41,077
Hey.

1320
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:44,748
How you doing?

1321
01:31:45,416 --> 01:31:48,335
About three degrees south of awful.

1322
01:31:49,629 --> 01:31:52,088
l don't even know what that means.

1323
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:57,093
So they checked you out and you're okay.
Baby's okay.

1324
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:03,517
Honey, that guy...

1325
01:32:04,727 --> 01:32:07,270
What happened? Did they catch him?

1326
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:13,193
Abel took care of him.

1327
01:32:13,277 --> 01:32:14,444
Abel?

1328
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:17,322
-Shot him.
-ln our house?

1329
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:21,243
What was Abel doing in our house?

1330
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:26,831
We heard the alarm. Ran over.

1331
01:32:28,834 --> 01:32:30,126
Right.

1332
01:32:34,131 --> 01:32:37,050
-Hey, you need to rest, okay?
-Yeah.

1333
01:32:37,134 --> 01:32:41,596
They're just gonna do a few more tests
and we'll get out of here soon.

1334
01:33:02,535 --> 01:33:03,577
Yeah, Turner here.

1335
01:33:03,661 --> 01:33:05,537
Hey, my man. How's it going?

1336
01:33:05,621 --> 01:33:07,497
Detective. How goes it with you?

1337
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:08,873
Hey, man, l just wanted you to know,

1338
01:33:08,958 --> 01:33:11,418
l told them you never
laid a finger on that guy.

1339
01:33:11,502 --> 01:33:13,044
Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.

1340
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:15,130
So when you coming back?

1341
01:33:15,798 --> 01:33:17,382
You know, it's hard to say. l don't know.

1342
01:33:17,466 --> 01:33:18,675
Baby.

1343
01:33:19,802 --> 01:33:22,178
Yeah, well, we still got
some fine times ahead of us, man.

1344
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:25,056
l'm not taking that test for,
like, probably a year, or whatever.

1345
01:33:25,141 --> 01:33:26,433
That's great.

1346
01:33:26,517 --> 01:33:30,103
Anyway, l just thought l'd call
and check up on you, man.

1347
01:33:30,187 --> 01:33:31,521
l saw your neighborhood on the news

1348
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:35,108
and you pour that whole reservoir
on it if you have to, okay?

1349
01:33:35,192 --> 01:33:37,235
You know l will. Thanks for calling.

1350
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:38,486
All right.

1351
01:33:38,571 --> 01:33:39,696
Bye.

1352
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:44,034
Hey.

1353
01:33:58,299 --> 01:34:02,052
Go on through. Right on through.
Keep going.

1354
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:12,354
-He's right. They've been notified!
-lt's closed off.

1355
01:34:12,438 --> 01:34:14,022
Hey. Can we go up?

1356
01:34:14,106 --> 01:34:16,024
Only fire crew and homeowners, sir.

1357
01:34:16,108 --> 01:34:18,234
We live on Lakeview Circle.

1358
01:34:18,694 --> 01:34:20,111
Hold on.

1359
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:24,658
That's us. That's our address.

1360
01:34:24,742 --> 01:34:27,452
l strongly suggest you pack
what you can quickly and evacuate.

1361
01:34:27,536 --> 01:34:29,162
Nobody knows where
this thing's headed right now.

1362
01:34:29,246 --> 01:34:31,373
-Okay. Thanks.
-Thank you.

1363
01:34:31,457 --> 01:34:33,792
All right, clear a lane here!

1364
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:42,425
No problem. Let them through.

1365
01:34:49,016 --> 01:34:50,100
Hey.

1366
01:34:50,851 --> 01:34:53,812
You better think about getting out of here.

1367
01:34:53,896 --> 01:34:55,563
l'll tough it out.

1368
01:35:51,328 --> 01:35:54,080
Yo, what's up? This is Clarence. Leave it.

1369
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:04,442
Oh, God.

1370
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:18,164
This is unbelievable.

1371
01:37:18,874 --> 01:37:20,333
Oh, my God.

1372
01:37:26,131 --> 01:37:27,632
Honey, we should start packing.

1373
01:37:27,716 --> 01:37:30,844
l know. l know, l know, l know.
Let's get going.

1374
01:37:33,806 --> 01:37:36,808
You know what?
Go on inside, l'm gonna go talk to Abel.

1375
01:37:36,892 --> 01:37:39,602
-Baby...
-No, l wanna thank him.

1376
01:37:43,607 --> 01:37:44,816
Right.

1377
01:37:51,657 --> 01:37:52,949
Abel.

1378
01:37:53,450 --> 01:37:54,701
Hey, how's your wife?

1379
01:37:54,785 --> 01:37:57,370
She's okay. Thanks to you.

1380
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:02,792
Look, that guy who broke in,

1381
01:38:05,921 --> 01:38:07,797
he deserved what he got.

1382
01:38:09,174 --> 01:38:11,259
And l'll tell anyone that.

1383
01:38:17,057 --> 01:38:19,809
You know, you better get on this
or get on back down the hill.

1384
01:38:19,894 --> 01:38:22,979
Yeah, we're just gonna
grab some things and...

1385
01:38:24,481 --> 01:38:26,357
Just wanna say thanks.

1386
01:38:38,037 --> 01:38:39,287
Okay.

1387
01:38:39,371 --> 01:38:42,165
Babe, what can l get from downstairs?

1388
01:38:43,792 --> 01:38:45,710
Just the photo albums.

1389
01:38:55,179 --> 01:38:57,889
Okay. l'll be right back up.

1390
01:39:22,414 --> 01:39:23,665
Turner.

1391
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:51,192
Lisa!

1392
01:40:06,834 --> 01:40:08,126
Chris?

1393
01:40:09,545 --> 01:40:11,587
You got this all wrong.

1394
01:40:12,339 --> 01:40:14,340
Yeah, that's the bad guy's phone.

1395
01:40:14,425 --> 01:40:18,302
He's been calling me, threatening me,
saying he's gonna hurt Celia.

1396
01:40:18,387 --> 01:40:20,596
Came to your place by mistake.

1397
01:40:21,223 --> 01:40:23,975
You said yourself l did the right thing.

1398
01:40:24,727 --> 01:40:27,353
And you were good with that, right?

1399
01:40:34,069 --> 01:40:35,069
Chris!

1400
01:40:35,612 --> 01:40:37,030
Oh, God!

1401
01:40:37,906 --> 01:40:42,535
Stay down! Stay down!
Don't move, you son of a bitch!

1402
01:40:42,619 --> 01:40:44,829
Lisa! Lisa, get out here!

1403
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:47,749
Stay down!

1404
01:40:48,167 --> 01:40:52,003
Take the keys, take the car, take this phone,
go down the hill and get the police.

1405
01:40:52,087 --> 01:40:54,088
-What do you mean?
-He lied about everything!

1406
01:40:54,173 --> 01:40:56,299
He got the guy to break into the house!

1407
01:40:56,383 --> 01:40:58,593
Just go, honey, go! Go!

1408
01:40:58,677 --> 01:41:00,720
Okay, okay! Okay, okay.

1409
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:42,261
You son of a bitch!

1410
01:41:58,362 --> 01:41:59,904
Please help me!

1411
01:42:00,572 --> 01:42:01,739
Chris.

1412
01:42:02,533 --> 01:42:04,784
-Chris, help!
-Come on!

1413
01:42:05,786 --> 01:42:08,079
Chris! Chris, please help!

1414
01:42:08,163 --> 01:42:10,039
You can't get away!

1415
01:42:10,666 --> 01:42:12,458
Neither one of you!

1416
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:14,585
-Stay back!
-Give it up, Chris!

1417
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:16,295
Get away from us!

1418
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:18,798
-You made your stand!
-Chris!

1419
01:42:18,882 --> 01:42:21,259
-Get back!
-Come on!

1420
01:42:21,343 --> 01:42:22,593
Help me!

1421
01:42:28,684 --> 01:42:31,018
Please, no, no, no, no!

1422
01:42:35,190 --> 01:42:37,066
-Put down your weapon! Do it!
-Jesus Christ.

1423
01:42:37,151 --> 01:42:39,277
-Put down your weapon!
-He's trying to kill us!

1424
01:42:39,361 --> 01:42:42,738
l got it under control, fellows.
lt's all right, okay?

1425
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:44,657
He's my neighbor.

1426
01:42:44,741 --> 01:42:47,577
He's having a bad day, you know?
He's under a lot of stress.

1427
01:42:47,661 --> 01:42:49,871
He's lying!
Don't listen to him, he's got a gun!

1428
01:42:49,955 --> 01:42:53,416
-l do not have a weapon! Look!
-No, he's lying.

1429
01:42:54,376 --> 01:42:57,753
His wife was attacked today.
l took the guy down.

1430
01:42:57,838 --> 01:42:59,672
You can call in and check that out.
All right?

1431
01:42:59,756 --> 01:43:01,215
Do not move any further!

1432
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:02,842
He's just a little demented.

1433
01:43:02,926 --> 01:43:06,095
He went off and attacked me,
but he's okay. All right?

1434
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:08,139
He's got a gun, it's right behind his back!

1435
01:43:08,223 --> 01:43:11,017
Listen, l'm LAPD, guys!
l'm law enforcement like you!

1436
01:43:11,101 --> 01:43:13,144
l don't give a damn
if you're the Pope, asshole!

1437
01:43:13,228 --> 01:43:15,188
Do not move any further!

1438
01:43:15,272 --> 01:43:16,439
lt's true, he's a cop!

1439
01:43:16,523 --> 01:43:18,649
See, Chris? l'm the police!

1440
01:43:19,401 --> 01:43:23,821
You have to do what l say, okay?
Put down the gun, all right?

1441
01:43:23,906 --> 01:43:25,031
Sir, put the weapon down!

1442
01:43:25,115 --> 01:43:27,783
No, l will not! Not till he puts his down!

1443
01:43:27,868 --> 01:43:29,202
-He's got a gun, God damn it!
-Chris, get down.

1444
01:43:29,286 --> 01:43:30,411
l do not have a gun.

1445
01:43:30,495 --> 01:43:31,871
Then turn around, Abel! Then turn around!

1446
01:43:31,955 --> 01:43:33,664
Sir, drop the weapon!

1447
01:43:33,749 --> 01:43:35,625
Please. Please get down.

1448
01:43:35,709 --> 01:43:36,709
Come on!

1449
01:43:36,793 --> 01:43:40,046
lf you point that thing at me, Chris,
you better be willing to use it.

1450
01:43:40,130 --> 01:43:42,173
-Stay where you are!
-This is what you want, huh, Abel?

1451
01:43:42,257 --> 01:43:44,050
-Sir, drop it!
-This is what you want?

1452
01:43:44,134 --> 01:43:45,593
Chris, listen to me! Stop it!

1453
01:43:45,677 --> 01:43:47,970
Listen to your wife, asshole!

1454
01:43:49,348 --> 01:43:50,848
Chris, please stop!

1455
01:43:51,934 --> 01:43:53,184
Chris.

1456
01:43:57,648 --> 01:44:00,566
-Did you listen to your wife?
-What?

1457
01:44:00,651 --> 01:44:02,443
-Did you?
-Chris, stop!

1458
01:44:02,527 --> 01:44:04,528
Maybe you should've listened to your wife.
Did you see it coming?

1459
01:44:04,613 --> 01:44:07,031
-Shut up! You don't bring my wife into this!
-When she ran off on you?

1460
01:44:07,115 --> 01:44:08,908
-You leave my wife out of this!
-Did you see it coming?

1461
01:44:08,992 --> 01:44:11,911
-Don't let her name come out of your mouth!
-Did you see it coming, Abel?

1462
01:44:11,995 --> 01:44:15,164
-He's got a gun! He's got a gun!
-Just shut up!

1463
01:44:44,528 --> 01:44:47,029
Ma'am, can you come with me please?

1464
01:44:48,532 --> 01:44:50,950
Just take your time. Here we go.

1465
01:44:55,038 --> 01:44:57,707
Let's get you up in here to see someone.

1466
01:44:59,209 --> 01:45:00,876
Watch your step.

1467
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:08,217
Hey.

1468
01:45:09,469 --> 01:45:12,972
We're gonna move him to the hospital now.
We've stopped the bleeding.

1469
01:45:13,056 --> 01:45:14,515
You should let me take a look at you, miss.

1470
01:45:14,599 --> 01:45:16,142
No, l'm fine.

1471
01:45:16,226 --> 01:45:17,977
-You sure?
-Yeah.

1472
01:45:25,110 --> 01:45:26,527
How are you?

1473
01:45:29,781 --> 01:45:31,866
Three degrees south of...

1474
01:45:42,210 --> 01:45:43,586
l love you.

1475
01:45:45,464 --> 01:45:46,922
l know.

1476
01:45:49,509 --> 01:45:51,135
l love you, too.

1477
01:45:54,431 --> 01:45:56,307
The rest isn't important.

1478
01:46:02,147 --> 01:46:04,106
We're gonna have a family.
