- Here you go, sweetie.
- Oh, thanks.

14
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,899
I tried banana nut
sprout this morning.

15
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,068
Thought, you know, a
little change of pace,

16
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:12,446
thought somebody deserves something
special for his birthday.

17
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,572
Yeah. It's good.

18
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:16,450
Okay, so I made reservations
tonight at Babbo at 8:30.

19
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:20,245
I thought maybe we could talk
about, you know, setting a date?

20
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,791
Did you just make a
plan to make a plan?

21
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,751
- Did I just do that again?
- Yeah, you did.

22
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,878
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

23
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,047
All right, I'll see
you later, okay?

24
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,716
- Hey, hey, hey! Love you.
- Love you, too.

25
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,593
- Bye.
- Bye.

26
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,762
- Happy birthday!
- You, too!

27
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,561
Hello, sir. Would you
like to buy some cookies?

28
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:48,273
I would. I really would.
I just...

29
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,296
Unfortunately, I don't
have any money.

30
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,612
I don't have any cookies.

31
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,658
Jack?

32
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,786
I need a key.

33
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,085
Wow.

34
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,171
Wow. That...

35
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,632
A key?

36
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,801
What? No! I want a key.

37
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,566
Like an actual key to your apartment
so I don't have to wait outside

38
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,806
when I'm dressed in these
little slutty outfits.

39
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,058
I don't want to live with you.

40
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,977
No offense.

41
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,604
And you know I mean this in
the nicest possible way.

42
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,150
You're not exactly serious
boyfriend/marriage material.

43
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,485
And I pride myself on that.

44
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,864
I gotta go. I'll see you next week.
What're we doing?

45
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:41,034
Mother of the baby saved from the
fire and the sexy shirtless fireman?

Not now.

60
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:29,541
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey! Here we go! Yeah!
That's looking good! All right!

61
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,586
That's good form right there.
Let's keep that up, huh?

62
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,048
That's a beautiful veneer. Just throw
that on the edge-band and we're set.

63
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,050
- All right!
- Hey, Jack?

64
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:41,720
- Do you know what time it is?
- What? I can't hear you over the saw.

65
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,305
We're in the zone over here.
I don't want to lose focus.

66
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,098
That's how people
lose fingers, huh?

67
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:48,393
- You're fired.
- All right. We are fired up, boys!

68
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,479
You are fired!

69
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,857
All right.

70
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,152
I'll play you for it.
You win, I'm out.

71
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,364
I win. I get a second chance.

72
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,700
It's not a second chance when
you've had a hundred of them.

73
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:15,837
Oh! Nine-seven! Keeping my job!
Yeah!

74
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,677
Okay. All right.

75
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,179
- I'll give you one.
- Do you know what?

76
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,555
You're supposed to
be the future boss,

77
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,350
but you're too busy being
the life of the party.

78
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:31,270
At some point, you're gonna
have to step up and be a man.

79
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:40,153
- Eight-nine! Unemployment!
- Okay, man. You want to play?

80
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,659
Nine-nine! Food stamps!
Tastes so good.

81
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:54,751
- Okay, that's not even a shot.
- The boss got game! The boss got game!

82
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,629
Ten-nine. This is it, Jack.

83
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,346
- You know what? This is ridiculous.
- You know what? That's your problem.

84
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,892
You can't handle the pressure. As soon as
you think you're going to lose, you quit.

85
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,647
Game over, Jack.

86
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,108
Don't get me wrong.
You're like a son to me.

87
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:24,031
- Dad, I am your son.
- Yeah, and it's time to cut the cord.

88
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,491
Let's go clean out your desk.

89
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,081
Mason has no idea,
not an idea at all.

90
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:36,960
- That you're pathetic, or...
- What, do you think I went overboard?

91
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,922
No. No, I think it's the
exact right amount of board.

92
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,216
Which is what I am right now.
Can we start drinking?

93
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,677
Of course. Okay, lookit!
These are for Mason.

94
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,928
What's that?

95
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,097
Vegas? I thought
you hated Vegas.

96
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,383
I do, but, you know, that's
why they call it a gift tip,

97
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:55,103
- because it truly is selfless.
- Oh, thanks.

98
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,067
Okay, everyone listen! I'm
going to bring him in,

99
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,320
I'm gonna turn on the lights, and
that's when you yell, "Surprise!"

100
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,864
Oh, that's how a surprise party works!
I'm totally gonna write that down.

101
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,658
Okay. Everyone, hide!
Hide, hide, hide!

102
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,582
- Hi, sweetie!
- Hey!

103
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,752
Welcome home. Happy birthday.
Okay, come inside...

104
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:22,047
- Listen, Joy. We need to talk.
- Okay. Well, let's do it inside. Okay?

105
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,466
No, no, no. I can't,
or I'll never do this.

106
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,926
Look, there's no easy
way to say this.

107
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,844
Okay, then don't. Okay?
Just think it,

108
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,222
and then later, I'll try to figure
out what it was you were thinking.

109
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,515
Okay? Let's just go inside.

110
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,351
No, no, no, no, no, no!
This can't wait, Joy.

111
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,812
You know I have a
really important job.

112
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:37,938
- Right?
- Yeah.

113
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:41,066
So when I come home, I want
this place to be an escape.

114
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,361
And as of late, it's not.

115
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:48,990
Yes, the sex is great, okay?
I mean, that's fantastic,

116
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:53,203
and I can't tell you how much I appreciate
all the things you've been trying

117
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,329
with my balls.

118
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,833
But the rest is so exhausting.

119
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:02,838
You're so on all the time, with all the
scheduling and planning, it's just...

120
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,674
I don't want to marry you, Joy.

121
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,718
I'm leaving you.

122
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,973
Well, I mean, this is my place, so
technically, you would be the one

123
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,892
that has to leave, but...
Are you crying?

124
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,522
Surprise.

125
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,192
- Oh, shitballs.
- Yeah.

126
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,527
Hey!

127
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,696
Hey. Here...

128
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,615
Do you have any idea how
much money I've made him?

129
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,452
You're my lawyer. Can I
sue him for something?

130
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,788
Well, the problem with suing your
father is that he's your dad.

131
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,623
He'd love it. He'd
think we were bonding.

132
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,378
Maybe he would be! You don't know.
Take him to court. It might be nice.

133
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:47,090
- What am I gonna do about money?
- You're just realizing that right now?

134
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,926
- Fascinating.
- I could do a lot of things for money.

135
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,344
I'm good at stuff.

136
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,389
I'll bet you $5 I can finish
this beer faster than you.

137
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,058
Really? You're on.

138
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,480
He doesn't even deserve me.

139
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,648
Here's my thought on what we should
do with this whole Mason thing.

140
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,816
- Okay.
- Once a week,

141
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,526
we get some of my brother's
loser-ass friends

142
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,321
to go over to Mason's
house, ring his doorbell,

143
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,199
and when he answers,
they're just gonna, bang,

144
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,743
junkpunch him right up
in his man business

145
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,027
and then he's gonna keel over.

146
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:19,122
While he's writhing on the
ground screaming, "Why?"

147
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,333
they'll go, "You know why!"

148
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,753
Wow! Did you just think of that?

149
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,797
No, I was thinking about
it a lot on the way over.

150
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,299
You are a child!

151
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,512
- What is that? What is that?
- Double or nothing.

152
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,222
Joy, you're gonna need
to take off this ring.

153
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,891
No, I... I'm just...
I'm just gonna...

154
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,519
I'm just going to wear
it on the other hand.

155
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,646
You're on fire. Man,
you are on fire.

156
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,689
This is like... I
mean, you're lucky.

157
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,150
- I don't feel good.
- We need to capitalize on this.

158
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,235
You know what's gonna
make you feel better?

159
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,361
What?

160
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:52,656
Where's the one place where
you can step up and be a man?

161
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,865
Community college?

162
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,536
Where can you go where you
can forget all your troubles

163
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,579
and act like a total idiot?

164
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:03,833
I am talking about one place
and one place only, my friend.

165
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,168
Do not say Vegas.

166
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,336
Please say Vegas.

167
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,171
- Vegas, baby.
- Vegas?

168
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,673
- Las Vegas?
- What?

169
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,633
Swish it around in your mouth a little bit.
Think about it.

170
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,385
- Vegas!
- Vegas.

171
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,387
- Carefree.
- Say it like you mean it.

172
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,222
- Spontaneous.
- I can't hear you!

173
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,890
- Vegas!
- Vegas?

174
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:24,437
- Vegas!
- Vegas!

175
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,695
Hello, Las Vegas!

176
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,242
Wow.

177
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,327
Vegas.

178
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,457
Everyone, I'm so sorry, but our
computers are down right now,

179
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,294
so just bear with us, please.
I'm sorry. I know.

180
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,842
Okay, your fiance
is one lucky guy.

181
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,260
I love Vegas!

182
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,390
Time to get a big-boy drink.

183
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:05,645
I'll have a vodka and a Scotch.

184
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,449
This is where I'm passing out.
Pants, you're out of here.

185
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,382
Did we ever tell you you
scream like a girl?

186
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,013
My eyes! It burns!

187
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,060
My head! My head and
my eyes are burning!

188
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,603
My back!

189
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,566
My nose! My nose now!

190
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,077
Whoa! Whoa! Take it easy!

191
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:15,715
It's okay! It's okay!
They're gay!

192
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,425
- What?
- They're gay!

193
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,348
This... No, no, this is
not what it looks like.

194
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,233
We just... We all got
booked in the same room.

195
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:29,270
Let's just go downstairs.
I smell an upgrade!

196
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,816
- You guys aren't gay?
- No.

197
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,282
- I got this.
- No.

198
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,743
Just let me handle it, okay?

199
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:45,995
Okay.

200
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,915
Curtis. You and I
have a problem.

201
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,709
I think we both know
how this game works.

202
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,211
I complain, and you tell me
there's nothing you can do,

203
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,630
but we both know
that's a big, fat lie,

204
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,841
so why don't you just
save us both the trouble

205
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,300
and type in those special codes

206
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,261
that you know you're
gonna type in eventually

207
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:05,265
and find me two rooms
that are so nice

208
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,101
that it turns my night
right back around?

209
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,479
She's awfully hostile
for a girl named Joy.

210
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,484
I'm going to do exactly what
you're telling me to do, because

211
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,737
I'm a little frightened of you.

212
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:19,988
These are penthouse suites.

213
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,490
You can't get any higher than
that without going on the roof,

214
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,411
and you're not allowed on the
roof, because people jump.

215
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,418
Penthouse suites.

216
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,878
- Nice!
- No!

217
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,838
- Yeah.
- That's not bad.

218
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,673
Well, you're welcome.

219
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,800
Now watch and learn.

220
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,928
- Hey, buddy.
- Oh, hi. How are you?

221
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,931
I think you just met
my friend back there.

222
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,433
Kind of a scary person.

223
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,101
Oh, Egyptian cotton.
That's nice.

224
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,771
I want to apologize for her. For
three weeks out of the month,

225
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,773
we get to enjoy God's
most precious creation,

226
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,608
and on week four,
the bill arrives.

227
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,277
I know what you mean.
A period, right?

228
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,615
Look, I don't want to push here,

229
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:07,452
but I know that a man in your position is
capable of producing certain amenities.

230
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,290
Planet Hollywood. Yeah.

231
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,542
VIP!

232
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,679
Hey. So, you're from New
York, we're from New York.

233
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:31,226
- We're going to Le Cirque, please!
- Come on.

234
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,772
Look, I didn't bring my buddy
all the way out to Vegas

235
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,482
so he could get his ass kicked.
Right?

236
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,317
So the least you could do is
help me show him a good time.

237
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,487
Your buddy wouldn't know a good
time if it sat on his face.

238
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:46,825
Okay, you know what, Stripper? You
are kind of a disgusting skank.

239
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,952
Driver, we'll get out here!
Thank you!

240
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,119
- Okay, bye!
- Thank you.

241
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,914
- Use a condom, boys.
- Bye-bye. Bye. Just go!

242
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,336
Oh, come on. One drink.

243
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,922
I'm a pretty fun guy.
You can ask around.

244
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,133
Thanks, but we have
dinner reservations.

245
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,262
And we have to map out our
assault on the Strip.

246
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,640
You have a plan to make plans?

247
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,355
Excuse me?

248
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,692
I bet you look really
good with your hair down.

249
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,944
- My hair is down.
- One drink!

250
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,822
I dare you!

251
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,916
Did I invent hip-hop? No.
But I was there.

252
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,794
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

253
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,838
- So, Joy.
- Yeah?

254
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,715
What brings you to Sin City?

255
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,718
You know, just
being spontaneous,

256
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,178
cutting loose, like everyone else.
How about yourself?

257
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,432
Yeah. Me? Oh, I'm
here on business.

258
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,393
Big business, actually. I'm...

259
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,020
I'm a pretty important guy

260
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,730
in my field.

261
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,565
Really?

262
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,525
No.

263
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,652
Actually,

264
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:11,326
I just got fired.
So, cheers to that.

265
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,666
I just got dumped, so, salud.

266
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,754
Did I mention that I got fired
by my boss-slash-father?

267
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:26,341
Did I mention that I threw a surprise
birthday party for my fiance

268
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,510
and the surprise was that he dumped me
in front of all of our closest friends

269
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,804
while they hid in the closet?

270
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,932
Wow. Okay, you win.

271
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,517
Excuse me. We're gonna
need a whole bottle.

272
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,604
I saved a baby today.
I'm not a hero, though.

273
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,523
- You know what I mean? I'm not a...
- He's married.

274
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,027
This is my lesbian sister. Tell
her about your softball game.

275
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,695
Tell her about your
softball team.

276
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:53,117
What do you say we bet 10-to-1,
with $125 on the hard eight?

277
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,620
- Bets are right there.
- All right. Roll them out.

278
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:59,457
No, no, no, no, no. I wouldn't...
I wouldn't bet on me winning.

279
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,126
You roll, princess.

280
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,381
All right. Go, 44! 44!

281
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,804
This is my party trick.
Here it goes.

282
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,768
What are you gonna do?
Are you going to cut...

283
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,977
You know, you were
right about me.

284
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,186
You just cut it off!

285
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,815
It's like you're trying to come in
first but it's somebody else's race.

286
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,194
- It's like Egypt!
- It's amazing!

287
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,531
You never felt good enough, so you
took yourself out of the game.

288
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,910
To everyone who's
ever been dumped

289
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,414
and to everyone who
has ever been fired,

290
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,626
when I say, "Screw!"
you say, "You!"

291
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,879
- Screw!
- You!

292
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,132
Yes!

293
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,101
I think I just got to the point
where I wasn't even trying.

294
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,728
Why should you try?

295
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:05,148
I work 80 hours a week and
I don't even know why.

296
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,692
I've been so naughty!

297
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,986
Out of my way! Out of my way!

298
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,238
I'm not usually this honest.

299
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,282
I'm usually not this fun.

300
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,836
The best part is...

301
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,005
- We can really talk.
- Really connect.

302
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:32,717
Yeah, 'cause you're like the last person
on the planet I'd ever sleep with!

303
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,594
Ever! Ever! Ever!

304
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,348
This is gonna be fun!

305
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,836
Oh, God. Please be fake.
Please be fake.

306
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,174
Oh, God.

307
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:39,075
No, no, please, please, please!
Oh, please, please, no!

308
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,759
You can't get divorced here, okay?
You gotta do it where you live.

309
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,510
Besides, you don't want a divorce,
all right? You want an annulment.

310
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,834
See, what happens in Vegas, you
pay for when you get back home.

311
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,043
That's what the thing is.

312
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,838
What if she's a clinger?

313
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,841
What if she's a crier? What if
she's, like, a clinging crier?

314
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,468
You murder her. Problem solved.

315
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,722
You don't have to yell.

316
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,224
Was there any part of the night,

317
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,388
I don't know, maybe, say, the part where
I was about to marry the rebound guy,

318
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,854
that you thought,
"Hey, oh my God!"

319
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,398
"This is a really good
time for an intervention?"

320
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,482
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

321
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,277
I, like, threw up in
my own purse, so...

322
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:18,322
This is a city built on
excess and bad decisions.

323
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,533
Vegas should be the only place on
Earth where you can't get married.

324
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,160
Pull it together, dude.

325
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,662
You got to charm that ring
off her finger, okay?

326
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,006
- You all right?
- Yeah.

327
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,927
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

328
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,973
- Hi!
- Good morning.

329
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,516
- Morning.
- Good morning.

330
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,351
Morning, morning, morning.

331
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,813
I could use some coffee.

332
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,690
Oh, God, yeah.

333
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,985
Well, what's mine is yours.

334
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,114
Here, well, you want to, uh...

335
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,783
Mi coffee es su coffee.

336
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,542
- This is good orange juice.
- Yeah. It's very good.

337
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,461
It's ridiculously good.
The orange juice is good.

338
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,422
- I don't usually like pulp. You a fan?
- Not really.

339
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,634
- Jack?
- Yes.

340
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,970
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yep.

341
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,890
Yes. Yep. Talk. Sure.

342
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,226
They're so cute together!

343
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:32,021
If I could make someone dead
with my mind, it would be you.

344
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,993
- Yo.
- Hey.

345
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,289
So!

346
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,336
- Great night, huh?
- Yeah!

347
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,506
I mean, you are a
lot of fun, Joy.

348
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,801
- I am?
- Yeah!

349
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,428
A lot of fun. That... I
mean, last night was

350
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,390
so.

351
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,517
Great.

352
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,896
Actually, you know, there was like...
Maybe there was one tiny little thing...

353
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,315
I think I know what you mean.

354
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,318
Okay, this...

355
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,862
There's no easy way to say
this, so I'm just going to...

356
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,198
Whoa, whoa. Wait. Are...

357
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,033
Are you

358
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,703
- dumping me?
- You didn't...

359
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,788
No! I was coming down
here to dump you!

360
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,707
- Oh! Jeez... Okay, so we're good!
- Yeah!

361
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,126
- Okay, disaster averted!
- You said it!

362
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,586
- Yeah, no. Bullet dodged!
- You betcha!

363
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,714
I mean, pooch unscrewed!
Free at last!

364
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,466
- Thank God Almighty, I'm free at last.
- Okay. I got it, okay?

365
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,969
- Got it.
- Okay. I'm sorry. I...

366
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,055
You just seem like the type of girl who's
looking for a serious relationship,

367
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,060
and I'm not that... I mean, you...
Like...

368
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,643
No offense, but you seem
like a lot of work.

369
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,896
Like it would take, like, a
team of guys, and I'm not...

370
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:00,776
Marriages are an
outdated concept...

371
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,653
Are you dumping me again?

372
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,018
- I'm in a really weird place right now...
- Where's that, Jack? The starting line?

373
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:10,453
Because I have news for you, buddy.
The gun went off a long time ago.

374
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,913
Okay! Look at that! Good
luck with the job, huh?

375
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,541
"Employee handles
criticism poorly!"

376
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,545
Well, then maybe you should
teach a seminar, Jack,

377
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,005
considering you can't even keep
a job with your own father!

378
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:24,383
You know, the one person who's
biologically programed to love you,

379
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,761
and even he can't stand you!

380
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:30,514
Look at that. You had to come all the way
to Vegas and marry a complete stranger

381
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,477
just to prove that you're not a robot.
Congratulations, Joy! That was a feeling!

382
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,021
Oh, I have a feeling, all right!
It's called nausea!

383
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,856
Yeah? "Oh, I
have a feeling, all right!"

384
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,024
"It's called nausea!"

385
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,902
- How old are you, five?
- Six, actually. I'm six.

386
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,195
You know, this is why
we'd never work.

387
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:48,449
'Cause I could never, ever be with
someone that's so completely broken!

388
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,909
- Broken?
- Broken!

389
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,203
Broken. You know what? You
don't even know me, mister!

390
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,955
No, I don't know you, and I got
a feeling that neither do you.

391
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,624
You know what? I'll call
you about the annulment.

392
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:00,002
How about this? Why don't
you just e-mail me?

393
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,922
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

394
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,758
- We'll always have Vegas!
- Hey! That's my quarter!

395
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,030
What the...

396
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,492
<i>♪ We are the champions, ♪
♪ my friends. ♪</i>

397
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:36,914
<i>♪ And we'll keep on ♪
♪ fighting till the end ♪</i>

398
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:40,334
I'm really, really rich!
I'm really, really rich!

399
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:41,877
We are the champions.

400
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,838
That was my quarter!

401
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,508
We are the champions.

402
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,261
- We did it!
- Richest man in the world!

403
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,346
No time for losers 'Cause
we are the champions.

404
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,891
A big giant check! I'm so happy!
I've never been...

405
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,352
I'm really happy!

406
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,938
Oh, my God! That was my quarter!

407
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,484
Congratulations! You just
quadrupled your investment!

408
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,319
What, you think this is all yours?
God!

409
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:11,490
Yes, it's mine. I put the quarter in
the machine and I pulled the lever.

410
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:15,870
My quarter on the machine that I was
using, the one I loosened up for you!

411
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,205
That's right! Now if
you'll excuse me,

412
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,208
I have a giant colofrul
check to deposit!

413
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:25,296
Whatever happened to "What's
mine is yours, baby"?

414
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,341
We're married now, remember?

415
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:38,517
More importantly, Your Honor, my client
only knew Miss McNally for four hours

416
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,186
before they "got married,"

417
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,063
three and a half of which
were spent in a state of

418
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,815
total inebriation.

419
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,567
Mmm-hmm.

420
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:49,028
You. Other one.

421
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:52,406
You have any evidence that you both
knowingly entered into this marriage,

422
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,991
that it's not just a sham?

423
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,409
Let me see.

424
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:59,038
Would a note do?

425
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,707
It's a start.

426
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:09,089
And then there's a photo.

427
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,092
Nice.

428
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,137
I didn't
know anything about that.

429
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,722
There's also

430
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:21,977
- a video.
- And I am going to provide for her,

431
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,938
I'm gonna love her,

432
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,774
and I'm going to
provide for her,

433
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,193
- 'cause we're married!
- Married!

434
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,446
We're all gonna get laid!

435
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:36,617
Was that you, Cueball?
His lawyer?

436
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,954
I didn't... I don't
have my glasses on.

437
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,877
I don't like you.

438
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,712
I don't like any of you.

439
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:52,341
Your generation, with your
Vegas and your Internet

440
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,635
and your "I want it right now."

441
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,680
You know, gay people aren't
destroying the sanctity of marriage,

442
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,098
you people are.

443
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,809
Marriage is about
love and commitment.

444
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:07,439
Listen, I've been married for 25 years to
the same wondefrul, infuriating woman,

445
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,150
and granted, there are days when
I want to light her on fire,

446
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,820
but I don't, because I love her,

447
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,321
and that would be illegal.

448
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,326
And you know something? I
might be old-fashioned,

449
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:20,578
but when I said those vows
out loud, I meant them.

450
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,580
This guy is such a douche.

451
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,374
Before, or should I say if

452
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,876
I ever allow either of you
out of this marriage,

453
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,920
I'm going to make sure
that you try everything,

454
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,257
and I do mean everything,
first to make it work.

455
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,301
- Objection, Your Honor. You can't do that.
- Objection!

456
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:38,304
Watch me. Now, do either one
of you have a place to live?

457
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,806
I don't at the moment,
Your Honor, but I will.

458
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,683
You see, I...

459
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,935
My ex-fiance and I
broke up, and...

460
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,689
You know, Mrs. Fuller, you're not
helping make your case here, okay?

461
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:52,359
What about you, pretty boy?
You got a crash pad?

462
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,863
- Yes.
- Okay, great! We have a hearth!

463
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,366
I am freezing the $3 million
for the next six months

464
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:03,203
and sentencing you two to
six months hard marriage.

465
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,913
And so I can keep an eye on you,

466
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:08,250
I'm ordering you both into
weekly marital counseling.

467
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,252
I want you two to listen to me.

468
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:15,507
You better play by my rules on this, or
I'm gonna tie this money up in litigation

469
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,302
that is so long, so
protracted, so expensive

470
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:22,348
that neither one of you
will ever see a dime of it.

471
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,934
All right. Anything... Oh, yeah!
One more thing.

472
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,562
I now pronounce
you man and wife!

473
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,110
Can he do that?

474
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,029
Yeah, he's the judge. He
can do whatever he wants.

475
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,989
And he clearly wants to make
an example out of you both.

476
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,949
If you just do
what the guy says,

477
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,993
he's gonna be forced to
grant you a divorce.

478
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,453
- In which case...
- You would probably...

479
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:45,537
- ...split...
- ...the money...

480
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,206
...equally as marital property.

481
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,999
You didn't do anything in there!

482
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,364
- What?
- You didn't do anything!

483
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:53,379
I called her a vixen!
I called her a vixen!

484
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:55,964
- So?
- So.

485
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,370
I can do anything
for six months.

486
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,719
I can not wear pants for six months.
So if you aren't up to it...

487
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,471
Oh, I am so up to it.

488
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,973
And if you're trying to insinuate
that I'm the one that can't do this,

489
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,559
then you are sorely
mistaken, short bus.

490
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,520
Whoa! Okay! So it's
settled, then.

491
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,897
All right. Think of it as
a business arrangement.

492
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,942
Be married for six months,
get $1 .5 million.

493
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,946
- How hard can it be?
- I know how hard it isn't.

494
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,157
Excuse me. Out of my way.

495
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,492
Thank you.

496
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:28,414
- Oh, Jesus. Here.
- Great.

497
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,294
Smile for the camera.

498
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,880
Hi, hubby, it's me. Open up.

499
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,215
Hiya!

500
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,994
It's all the
way at the top.

501
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,427
She's here.

502
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,837
Okay, don't overdo it, though.

503
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:50,853
Hey! Look what I
brought my new hubby!

504
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:54,231
'Cause I want to please him,
and men, they like the beer.

505
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:58,569
Hey, look who's being a good wifey,
really trying to make her marriage work.

506
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,738
Oh, muffin pants, what
a wondefrul gift.

507
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:04,408
I'm going to buy you a big box of
Tampax just so I can thank you,

508
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:07,077
'cause that's what
good husbands do.

509
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,126
Sorry, I can't control
myself when I'm around you,

510
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,253
I just love you so much!

511
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,504
Not as much as I love you!

512
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,384
Shall we, Mrs. Fuller?

513
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,095
Oh. Here. Let me get this.

514
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,680
- Let me get that. Oh!
- Wait a sec.

515
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,975
Slippery. Slippery.

516
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:35,522
What?

517
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,029
Sorry, baby, just you're a
little on the heavy side.

518
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,156
Welcome home, sweetheart.

519
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,619
You literally have a bar in the
middle of your living room.

520
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:49,953
It's not so bad.

521
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,998
I mean, I would never
live here, ever, but...

522
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:55,918
What? I ran the New York
City Marathon, okay?

523
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,712
I can do this. I can
totally do this.

524
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,925
Oh, my God.

525
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,302
I can't do this!

526
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,887
Don't throw any of
that hair away, okay?

527
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,389
I'm saving it up to make
you something special,

528
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,975
like a hat or a sweater.

529
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,102
I still haven't decided yet.

530
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,396
Do you train monkeys in here?

531
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:20,859
Seriously! It's one thing if you like a guy,
you put up with disgusting stuff like this,

532
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:24,321
but you I don't care
for, so clean it up.

533
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,908
I'm not here under court order,
so I'm going to take off.

534
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,535
- Later, buddy.
- Bye.

535
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,787
$1.5 million.

536
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36,083
Here. These are antibacterial.
Get to work.

537
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,677
That looks like it's gonna
be comfortable for you.

538
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,554
Where's the bedroom?

539
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:53,559
- Uh... It's in there.
- Sweet dreams.

540
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,768
Yeah.

541
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,856
What is this?

542
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,778
Ooh. That was close.

543
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,867
- That stinks.
- Just a little bit of me.

544
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:13,287
- Oh, God!
- And some other people. Whatever.

545
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,602
- Do you need some help?
- Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact.

546
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,562
You should probably
call somebody.

547
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,814
- What?
- To help you.

548
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,277
Hey, could you do that thing
where you turn around on the bed

549
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,737
and fix the top side again?

550
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,405
Okay, can I sleep on the couch?

551
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,531
No.

552
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,300
Smoothies!

553
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,307
- Hon?
- Yeah.

554
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,975
If I could just get
in there for a sec.

555
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,546
I'm almost done.
I'll be right out.

556
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,312
No, no. "Be right out" is
not really gonna work.

557
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,314
Like, be right out right now.

558
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,441
I'm almost done!

559
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,662
Okay...

560
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,750
Oh, yeah, this is happening.

561
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,586
You only have yourself to blame.

562
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,214
By the way, it's
your day on dishes.

563
00:32:58,893 --> 00:32:59,893
Freak.

564
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,269
Where do you get your underwear?
The hospital?

565
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:04,064
- What?
- Seriously, what's up with the P.E. bra?

566
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:07,943
Well, it's comfy and supportive,
like a man should be.

567
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:12,155
You women. In the beginning it's all,
like, laces and rainbows and trapdoors.

568
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,826
As soon as you get married, it's nothing
but these flesh tones and PMS pants.

569
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,411
You might as well wear a
placard around your neck

570
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,830
- that says, "We're not having sex, ever."
- Ever!

571
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,039
- Ever.
- Ever!

572
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,834
What happened to the purple bra from Vegas?
That was nice.

573
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:27,212
I'm going to save that for
my non-retarded husband.

574
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,842
Well, the grownups have
to go to work today.

575
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:35,595
- What are you going to do all day?
- I don't know yet.

576
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,182
I'd rather do nothing and be happy
than do something I know I don't love.

577
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,101
Words to live by, Yanni.

578
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,186
Beat it, worker drone.
Tell the man I say hi.

579
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,273
- Whatever, loser.
- Hey, don't get hit by a bus.

580
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,649
Or do. Whatever.

581
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,610

586
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,599
- Who is this?
- Your boss.

587
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,226
Get the Chonger and get
up here right away.

588
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,480
Coming right up! Okay. Banger
needs to see us upstairs.

589
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:30,192
After 15 years of loyal service,
we're dumping Bob whatshisname,

590
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:33,278
which means that this office
is gonna be up for grabs.

591
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,643
So, I'm going to promote one
of you skirts out of the pit.

592
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:38,575
And that's not sexual harassment.
Believe me, I've checked.

593
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,036
You're my top guns, girls.
Do me proud.

594
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,662
Thank you, sir.

595
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,416
So! I guess I'll be Maverick
and you can be Goose.

596
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,586
Be whoever you want to be, you'll
still gonna be my subordinate.

597
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,422
- Excuse me?
- It's from the Latin, meaning "my bitch."

598
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,466
- What is wrong with you?
- I eat girls like you.

599
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,593
- Oh, you eat girls!
- Not like that.

600
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:57,677
- Makes total sense.
- It shouldn't.

601
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,085
- No judgments.
- But I'm not...

602
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,180
Just saying.

603
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,939
Ready to do this?

604
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:12,859
Pretend like you don't make me vomit
in my nose every time I look at you?

605
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:14,861
Yes.

606
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,991
So, Jack, tell me about yourself.
What are your hobbies?

607
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,327
Hobbies.

608
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,372
You mean, besides my marriage?

609
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,291
My hobbies.

610
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,460
Mostly, I just like loving her.

611
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,379
It's just so easy.

612
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,216
What else?

613
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:42,389
Listening. I love listening to
what she has to say. It's just...

614
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,809
In fact, actually, I carry
this notebook around with me,

615
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:49,855
just so I can write it down,
because usually it's so important.

616
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:54,693
What else? I think just being
there for her, in general.

617
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,321
Loving her until it hurts.

618
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,490
It hurts.

619
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:04,870
That's... I don't know, that's
probably most of my interests.

620
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,999
Joy?

621
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,667
I'd have to agree.

622
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:13,253
And I'd have to add, you know,

623
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,714
staring at him.

624
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:20,177
Yeah. I mean, I just
love watching him be.

625
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,595
I love everything about him.

626
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,055
Most people would be repulsed,

627
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,225
you know, to find his socks
and his dirty underwear

628
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,103
sort of down shoved in
the bottom of the bed,

629
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,855
touching them in the
middle of the night.

630
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,274
They might want to try to, like,
scrub and scrub and scrub

631
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:38,320
and try to get the stains and
the scent off of them, but...

632
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:43,283
Not me. I just... I love it!

633
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:47,370
I just... I kind of want
to just roll around in it!

634
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,250
Her candles smell awesome!

635
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:57,172
You know, I do have
a few degrees,

636
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:00,884
and I went to a bunch of
really expensive schools.

637
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:04,721
Anyway, I'm not buying any of the
bullshit you two are selling today.

638
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:07,390
Now, if you want me to
report back to the court

639
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,267
that you're both working
on your marriage,

640
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:12,020
you're gonna actually
have to do that.

Yes, that is the topping
I wanted on my popcorn.

648
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,227
I know that the box said
"movie theater butter,"

649
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,104
but, you guessed it,

650
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:57,816
what I really wanted was
Jack's Sweaty Ballsack flavor.

651
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,109
Thanks.

652
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,195
Uh! Uh! Uh! Love.

653
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:08,159
Who can tell me I am lost?
What is love, what is love?

654
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:11,037
I'm just giving you
what you wanted, baby.

655
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:18,295
Pay attention. See how it
goes up and down. Okay?

656
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,796
It goes up,

657
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,008
and then it goes down.
Like that.

658
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,302
See that? Isn't that magical?
Amazing.

659
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,637
Watch one more time.
One more time.

660
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:32,392
It goes up, right? And
then it goes down.

661
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,456
No, no, no, no! Why?

662
00:38:56,292 --> 00:39:00,003
I really, really need
to get in there!

663
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:03,048
Why don't you just use
your special bathroom?

664
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,549
There's no heavy side!

665
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,953
- You got the window!
- No, that's actually the light side.

666
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,567
- Where's the bathroom door?
- We got robbed.

667
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,944
And all they took was the door.

668
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:27,864
$1.5 million.

669
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,161
Marriage is hard!

670
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:35,955
I don't know how people do this.
It's unnatural.

671
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,750
Men and women are not
meant to coexist.

672
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:43,213
And I haven't had sex in forever.
I mean, forever!

673
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,298
And I need to have sex,
'cause I'm good at it!

674
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,550
That's a self-esteem
booster for me.

675
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,595
- I don't know if I can do this, man.
- Oh, really?

676
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:53,473
'Cause I haven't been
sensing that at all.

677
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,974
That's why I did a
little research.

678
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,684
I've been looking
through some case law,

679
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,728
you know, some precedent to
help us get around the ruling.

680
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,815
And I think I found one.
Lafferty Vs. Holden.

681
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,527
You know, Tip, I don't
know if I can do this.

682
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,445
Then we go to plan B.

683
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,656
Mother's third marriage
was to this 20-year-old

684
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,575
club-footed Cuban bartender
who came into a ton of money.

685
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,744
The court said that if they
both wanted the money,

686
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,580
they had to remain married and prove
they can make it work. Sound familiar?

687
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,666
Mother wasn't going to
see a cent of that,

688
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,001
but then she proved that
he'd been unfaithful,

689
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,129
and the judge ruled
in her favor.

690
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,297
And gave her all the money.

691
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,218
See, the judge said
that you had to prove

692
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,011
that you were trying to
make the marriage work.

693
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,514
But if we can make it
seem like she isn't...

694
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,307
I don't know why I haven't
thought of this before!

695
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,101
- Because you're not a very good lawyer.
- Oh, my God.

696
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:41,062
There should be a law against
how bad a lawyer I am.

697
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,147
But then again, I
wouldn't know about it!

698
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:45,108
So if I can get Jack to end the
marriage by either leaving me

699
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,569
or cheating on me...

700
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,154
Not only would you get
out of the marriage...

701
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:52,699
- You will also get the full $3 million.
- Oh, my God.

702
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,869
- I love you! I want to kiss you.
- You want to kiss me?

703
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,079
On your big, beautiful,
prematurely balding man dome.

704
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,372
All right! All right. Okay.

705
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,875
- Game on, sister!
- Game on!

706
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,793
- Game on.
- Game on.

707
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,422
Destroy it. Oh, my God.
Oh, Jesus!

708
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,151
There are some refinery
problems in the South,

709
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,987
- so let's keep our eye on crude oil.
- Oh, that's too bad.

710
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,322
And I just heard a rumor

711
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:35,492
that the platinum futures are
gonna be very active today.

712
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:36,659
Yes!

713
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:38,870
Yeah!

714
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:43,041
I mean, really, let's do this mother!
Oh, my God.

715
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:46,419
Right, guys? I mean, let's buy shit!
Let's buy shit!

716
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,631
Do you see that? Do
you see that, people?

717
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:53,009
That's exactly the kind of
spirit I'm talking about!

718
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,844
- You go, girl!
- Yes!

719
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:59,182
Oh, my God, seriously, you guys!

720
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,898
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What are we doing?
What are we doing?

721
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,618
What's happening? What's happening?
Oh, my God.

722
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,369
Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch!

723
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,882
- Hi.
- Hi.

724
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,009
We got locked out
of our apartment.

725
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:38,429
Would you mind if we just waited
in here until the locksmith comes?

726
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:41,140
He said it would
only be a few hours.

727
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,643
A few...

728
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,562
Sure.

729
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,771
- Thank you!
- Great!

730
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:49,816
Also, we were supposed to have
some friends over tonight.

731
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,652
Do you mind if they
waited in here, too?

732
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,072
I'll jump on that
grenade, too, I suppose.

733
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,574
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

734
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,660
- Thank you so much.
- No, thank you. Thank you.

735
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:03,580
Welcome to my humble abode.

736
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:08,167
Those are probably my friends.

737
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,422
- Hi.
- Hi.

738
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:14,173
We're the friends.

739
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,968
- You look like the friends. You do.
- Hi.

740
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,888
- Hey.
- There is a hot girl party going on

741
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,224
- in my living room.
- What are you talking about?

742
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:26,936
I'm talking about the fact that there
are a buttload of beautiful women...

743
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:30,356
Oh, my God. Okay, there's a
pillow fight about to break out.

744
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,275
Oh, my God. Dude, it's a trap.

745
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,195
No, it's not! No! This happens!

746
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,864
No! It doesn't happen!

747
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,575
Get out of the house! Get
out of the house right now!

748
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,539
She must have figured out
the same thing we did.

749
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,662
Okay, just because
Joy sets a trap

750
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,080
doesn't mean we can't
play at the same game.

751
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,291
You call Bear, you call
every guy we know.

752
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,043
And get some boring
stockbroker kind of guys,

753
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,544
the kind of guys you
and me would beat up.

754
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,795
The more boring, the better.

755
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,006
She has no idea what she's
gotten herself into.

756
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:02,096
You okay?

757
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,480
In here, guys. Yo,
Jack, what up?

758
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,823
This chick's the reason we're not
spending our money right now.

759
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:24,285
This chick is the reason I'm not
having a six-way right now!

760
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,329
- Hey.
- Hey.

761
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:29,832
So, look. This isn't working. I think
we need to call in some sluts.

762
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,335
- Sluts? I know sluts.
- Make the call.

763
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:35,755
Which one of these ugly
losers is ruining your life?

764
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:39,384
That one. The pink
parade over there.

765
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,552
That's your wife?

766
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:45,598
Oh, my God, she is so f-ing hot!

767
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,602
What is wrong with you?

768
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,273
Pick a team. Pick a team. Pick a team!
Right now! Pick a team.

769
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,858
- Come on.
- Hers. Hers! Hers!

770
00:44:55,943 --> 00:45:00,446
Listen up, girls. Do whatever you
need to do to get into his pants.

771
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,490
Ignore her. Don't even
make eye contact with her.

772
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:05,326
Look at every girl in here except for her.
It'll drive her crazy.

773
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,036
Get him drunk. It'll
slip right out.

774
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,162
Go!

775
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,046
Hi.

776
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:24,971
Oh, I get it.

777
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:28,099
I get what you guys are doing.
Okay.

778
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,561
Well, I'm going to... Thank you.
Sorry. Excuse me.

779
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,062
Oh, God!

780
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:39,110
If you need anybody to talk to,
you know, just let me know.

781
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,408
- Thanks.
- Get out of here. Get out of here.

782
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,869
Get out of here! Get out
of here, both of you!

783
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:48,953
I'll give her the money!

784
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,455
- I'll give her the money!
- No, no, no, no, no.

785
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:52,707
Oh, shit.

786
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,292
I'm here about a
noise complaint!

787
00:45:56,211 --> 00:46:00,131
Someone called to complain that
you're not making enough noise!

788
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:09,390
- This is the best party ever!
- This is the greatest party ever!

789
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:19,192
I'm arrested! You
guys, I'm arrested!

790
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:23,738
Hey.

791
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:26,824
Sorry. I was just trying
to find some quiet

792
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:30,495
- from the craziness out there.
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm... Beer?

793
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:33,956
Sure.

794
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:40,129
Do you really think that I'm
dumb enough to cheat on you?

795
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,631
I think it's only
a matter of time,

796
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,841
and, yeah, I think you're
more than dumb enough.

797
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,843
Thank you for the
vote of confidence.

798
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,386
I appreciate that.

799
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,389
This must be so hard for you.

800
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,061
- What?
- Being in a relationship.

801
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:00,233
Okay. I've been in relationships
before, all right?

802
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,151
Oh, come on, Jack.

803
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,904
I know you. Don't forget, I
have been living with you.

804
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:09,367
You're not exactly serious
boyfriend/husband material, okay?

805
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:14,163
- Well, this must be hard for you, too.
- Really?

806
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:18,501
Yeah, being married to me when you're
so clearly in love with your ex.

807
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,965
- I'm not in love with him.
- Right.

808
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,508
Then why are you still wearing
the ring on your finger?

809
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:27,844
Because my current
husband bought me one

810
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,054
out of a vending
machine in Vegas.

811
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:33,057
All I know is, if I
get dumped on my ass,

812
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,461
I'm not wearing the ring unless
I'm still in love with him.

813
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,520
- I'm not in love with him, okay?
- Okay! Right.

814
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,522
In fact, I'm happy I'm
not with him anymore.

815
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,148
I spent the last four
years of my life

816
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,693
trying to be somebody
else's idea of perfect,

817
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:47,446
and you know what? I still don't
feel good enough for him.

818
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,622
Okay, that's not what I meant, okay?
I just...

819
00:47:56,707 --> 00:48:00,001
Hey! Don't worry! Your
secret's safe with me.

820
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,878
Oh, you're such an ass.

821
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,421
You know what? It's
irrelevant now,

822
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:06,465
because I don't care if
I ever see him again.

823
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,140
Wow. Thank you, baby.

824
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:17,643
- That makes me feel so, so, so special.
- You know what? It has nothing

825
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,812
- to do with you, Jack.
- By the way, don't worry about me,

826
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,218
- because I'm a married man.
- Yeah.

827
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,733
We don't need to have sex. And
I'll tell you another thing.

828
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:27,111
I'm not going anywhere, 'cause I
am not screwing this thing up.

829
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:30,531
Neither am I, 'cause I am in
it for the long haul, Jack.

830
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:33,993
- Till death do us part.
- Not unless I kill you first.

831
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,465
- It's like she's always there!
- He doesn't do anything all day, okay?

832
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,634
- Left, right, up, down!
- It's like he's not even a grownup, okay?

833
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,344
- I don't have an ounce of space...
- He does nothing...

834
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,054
- ...for just me! Just me!
- ...all day long!

835
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:55,681
- And I swear to God...
- I think he's trying to drive me crazy!

836
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,600
- The other night, we had this party...
- He peed in the sink!

837
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,284
- ...and everywhere I look...
- I mean, what kind of man animal...

838
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,229
- ...it's just hot tit and ass everywhere!
- ...pees in the sink?

839
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:04,607
- It's like he doesn't even want...
- It's like she doesn't even want...

840
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,932
- ...this marriage to work!
- ...this marriage to work!

841
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:11,030
All right. You're arguing.

842
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:14,367
Now that felt like a
real married couple.

843
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,369
You're making progress.

844
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,084
What am I doing here?

845
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:35,972
Oh, we could kidnap her
until after the hearing.

846
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,724
- She could stay at my place.
- Oh, my God, I got it!

847
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,394
We make it look like she gave
you some kind of disease!

848
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,854
I can have a vial of crabs
here in 30 minutes.

849
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,106
First, we give them to you,

850
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,233
and then, you know, we get
somebody to give them to her

851
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,986
so it looks like she
gave them to you.

852
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,570
You really hadn't thought
that one through, had you?

853
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,658
I'll give her the crabs, easily.

854
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:58,452
- No more ideas from you.
- Oh, I've got it! It's perfect!

855
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,037
This is great!

856
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,248
Like that!

857
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,582
- What are you doing?
- What?

858
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,293
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Relax, relax, relax. Relax!

859
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:08,462
Stay with me on this one.

860
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,131
Huh?

861
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:14,635
God damn it! No, you don't get it!
Dude, you don't get it!

862
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,280
Jack, what happened
to your face?

863
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,158
- I fell.
- You fell?

864
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,285
Yeah.

865
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,122
I hit my head on a doorknob.

866
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,291
A few times.

867
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,418
I fall a lot these days.
I'm just...

868
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,086
I'm so clumsy.

869
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:52,214
Jack, are you sure that's
what happened to you?

870
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,051
Sure someone else
didn't do this to you?

871
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,138
I deserve it.

872
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,474
I'm supposed...

873
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,728
I'm supposed to line up the hand
towels just so, and I didn't...

874
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:08,647
I didn't do it. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

875
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,941
Then she said,
"You put that toilet seat down,"

876
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,610
"or I will put you down!"

877
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:17,448
And I forgot, and she said,
"I'll show you how to put it down!"

878
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:20,659
"I'll stick your head in there and
I will make it stay!" Oh, God!

879
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,078
- ...look real, but don't, like...
- All right.

880
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:24,080
- Oh, God!
- What?

881
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:27,083
He's gotta make it look real so it
seems like she was beating you!

882
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,667
Not that real!

883
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:32,463
- Yeah!
- That sucker's gonna show, dude!

884
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:33,923
Hey, come on. Come on.

885
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,674
Can we get back to therapy now?

886
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:39,929
Yes.

887
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:42,223
Yes, we can.

888
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,111
<i>Hi, you've reached the happy couple.</i>

889
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,403
<i>We can't come to the phone right now</i>

890
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,447
because we're busy
loving each other.

891
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,116
And making our marriage work.

892
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,920
- Leave a message!
- Leave a message!

893
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:03,244
Hi. This is Annette calling

894
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,329
from Dr. Twitchell's office.

895
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:06,789
Hello.

896
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,874
- Yes, Mrs. Fuller?
- Yes.

897
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:11,085
The doctor needed to
cancel today's session,

898
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:13,129
and she was wondering
if you could do Friday?

899
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,631
Do you have anything after
3:00 p.m., possibly?

900
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:19,135
- The doctor can do 4:00.
- Oh, perfect.

901
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,886
- That works for me.
- We'll see you then.

902
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:23,597
- Great, see you then.
- Thanks so much.

903
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:27,226
- She totally bought it.
- Beautiful. Beautiful.

904
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:30,062
- Beautiful.
- You owe me.

00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:19,695
Dr. Twitchell speaking.

918
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:22,364
- Yes, hi, this is Joy Fuller.
- Mrs. Fuller.

919
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:25,075
Yes. I got a phone
call from Annette

920
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,203
saying that our session
was canceled today.

921
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:30,706
- I just wanted to double-check that.
- Your session is definitely still on.

922
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,751
And any absence is considered
contempt of court.

923
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:34,835
It is?

924
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,465
Asshole! Trying to get
me to miss therapy!

925
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,801
75th and Riverside,
and step on it!

926
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,430
Okay.

927
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,602
- What?
- Hey!

928
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:54,146
Good luck paying for that
cab without your wallet.

929
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,733
Only five dollars?

930
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,401
You stole my wallet?

931
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,614
Lost your wallet, huh? Get out.

932
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,909
Come on. What do you want? We
can work something out here.

933
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:08,744
- Show me your breasts.
- What?

934
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:11,622
You'd be surprised how
often it happens.

935
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:16,335
- Okay, one breast. That's all you get.
- All right.

936
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,860
- Nothing like a nice boob.
- What is your problem?

937
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,135
What?
I like breasts. Sue me.

938
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,804
Is there any way around this?

939
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:29,848

is a way around this?

Is this seat taken?

You're remembering
your first date with somebody else!

969
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:42,648
No!
It was not our first date!

970
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,901
You keep thinking that. You always did.
You are demented!

971
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:47,403
- It was not!
- It was!

972
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,568

00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:49,947

Hi, honey! Welcome home!

976
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:55,702
Mom! Dad!

977
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:59,081
What are you doing here?

978
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:00,874
Well, I got a message
from your parents,

979
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:04,878
and I thought I'd surprise you
and invite them over for dinner.

980
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:09,425
You know that I've never
been invited over here?

981
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,510
No! Really?

982
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,262
Why didn't you
tell us you got married?

983
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,305
I know you're still mad
at me about the firing,

984
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,683
but you get married and
you don't tell us?

985
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,935
That is very, very hurtful.

986
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,391
- Especially...
- Dad, I...

987
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,606
Especially when it's a
catch like Joy here.

988
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:26,275
- What?
- Well...

989
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:28,694
We're so proud of you, Jack!

990
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,405
We didn't think you'd
ever settle down.

991
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:35,576
But then we met this wondefrul girl.
You couldn't have done better!

992
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,453
We are very proud of you, Son.

993
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:40,038
- Okay. Love biscuit?
- Yes, tinkle monkey?

994
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,499
Can I speak to you
for one second?

995
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,876
Of course!

996
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,801
He probably just wants
to give me a big smooch.

997
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,279
We haven't seen
each other all day!

998
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:52,050
My God! How weird is it
going to be in court

999
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:55,137
when your parents are
character witnesses for me?

1000
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,389
Well, obviously, you haven't
told them everything.

1001
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,641
No, I was waiting
for you to do that.

1002
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,393
What if we didn't?

1003
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:07,858
What would it take for you to just keep
this our little secret for a little bit?

1004
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:11,361
I want the bathroom door back.

1005
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:14,781
And I want the toilet
seat left the F down.

1006
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,033
No.

1007
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:18,118
- One time up...
- I got it.

1008
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:19,453
...and I make the call.

1009
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:20,704
- Done.
- Okay.

1010
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:24,166
Well, Jack, Sr., you
know, it is just so nice

1011
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:27,920
to finally meet the man who has
taught Jack everything he knows.

1012
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:30,047
- I tried.
- Well, something must've stuck.

1013
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,932
Do you know he made this
bar we're sitting at?

1014
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:34,384
Isn't it beautiful?
I mean, look.

1015
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,803
Dovetail's off on the corner.

1016
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,223
It's off!

1017
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,267
Well, I think it's great.

1018
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,521
I actually think that Jack
could sell his furniture.

1019
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:48,023
I don't know. That would
require actually finishing it.

1020
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:50,484
Maybe you should try telling Jack
you don't want him to finish it,

1021
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:53,028
then maybe he would
actually do it.

1022
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,491
What are you doing on Saturday?

1023
00:58:57,575 --> 00:59:00,077
You've got to come to Uncle Pat's
birthday in the park with us.

1024
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:01,787
I would love to.

1025
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,540
She went after my family!

1026
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,708
Dude, you're letting this
chick get in your head.

1027
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,252
Yeah, I know.

1028
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:12,130
Now I'm going to figure
out how to get into hers.

1029
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,091
You should never let a
chick get in your head.

1030
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:17,302
That's why I prefer not
to even talk to my dates.

1031
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:23,725
Yes!

1032
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,980
Why didn't I think of this before?
If she's going to play dirty, so am I.

1033
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,736
- Hi.
- Hey. Jameson, on the rocks.

1034
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:43,078
- You're Mason, right?
- Yeah.

1035
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:45,998
I'm Jack Fuller.
I'm a friend of Joy's.

1036
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:47,332
- Joy's?
- Yeah.

1037
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,960
I just wanted to
give you this back.

1038
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,379
She threw it in the trash.

1039
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:55,144
But, you know, guy code, I couldn't
just let it end up in the trash.

1040
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:57,259
I mean, you spent, what, like,
five, six thousand on this thing.

1041
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:59,261
Actually, thirty grand.

1042
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,180
I got it.

1043
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,642
All right. Well, thanks.

1044
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,228
Okay.

1045
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,359
Hey, how's she doing?

1046
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,031
You know, she's good.

1047
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:21,035
She's probably put on some
weight, though, right?

1048
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,993
From all the emotional
eating due to the break-up?

1049
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:25,245
You really lived up to the billing.
You know that?

1050
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,706
Joy told me what an
impressive guy you are.

1051
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:28,874
Oh! Yeah.

1052
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:32,169
She said she was trying
to be so perfect, because

1053
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:37,299
deep down, she never really felt like
she was good enough to be with you.

1054
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:40,594
But those insecurities
are long gone now.

1055
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,680
She's really come into her own.
She's on fire!

1056
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:46,526
I'll tell you what, she not gonna be
on the open market for very long.

1057
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:49,161
- It's a feeding frenzy out there!
- A feeding frenzy, huh? Yeah.

1058
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:51,188
Well, I gotta get going.

1059
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:55,067
My Uncle Pat is having a birthday
party tomorrow in Grove Park.

1060
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:56,276
Joy and I are going.

1061
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:59,821
Anyway, I gotta go pick up the present
she got for him. Bag of weed!

1062
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,365
- Her idea!
- Really?

1063
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:03,158
- She's on fire!
- Wow.

1064
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:04,493
On fire.

1065
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,080
Well, thanks again.

1066
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,545
Stripper! Hiya!

1067
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:18,590
- I so want to junkpunch that guy.
- What's with you and junkpunching?

1068
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:20,717
- Joy?
- Hi!

1069
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:23,011
I'm so glad you could make it.
Hey, sweetie.

1070
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:26,723
- Hi! This is my girlfriend, Tipper.
- Hi, Tipper. Judy.

1071
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:28,873
- Thanks for calling.
- Where's Jack?

1072
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:31,770
He's over there, coaching
the Little League.

1077
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,199

1082
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:56,878
This is my niece, and BFF,
the great Sammy Sosa.

1083
01:01:56,963 --> 01:02:01,466
Sammy, this is your Aunt Joy.

1084
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,552
- Nice to meet you, Sammy.
- Hi, Joy.

1085
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:05,303
I didn't know you
coached Little League.

1086
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:08,390
Oh, there's a lot of things you don't
know about me. Isn't that right?

1087
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:13,061
Jack wore a little fedora and
a leather jacket to school

1088
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:14,646
every day for six months.

1089
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,315
Who wouldn't want to
be Indiana Jones?

1090
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:18,942
I agree completely. I mean,

1091
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:23,029
Raiders of the Lost Ark may be
the greatest movie ever made.

1092
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:31,455
- I don't think I like what's going on here.

She doesn't seem so
bad, Uncle Jack.

1096
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:46,595

Mason.

1111
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:36,478
- What are you doing here?
- I was just visiting some friends.

1112
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:39,189
- In Brooklyn?
- Well, yeah. Yeah.

1113
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:41,733
Brooklyn. The B.K.
Love it here.

1114
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,401
Yeah, they're artists.
Yeah.

1115
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:46,238
Hey, you want to go grab a glass of vino?
Maybe chat up for a bit?

1116
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:50,325
I can't right now. Sorry.

1117
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:54,454
- Okay, all right. Well, maybe next week.
- I have my retreat.

1118
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:56,748
Wow!

1119
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:00,418
You seem fine.

1120
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:05,423
No, I mean, you look great. Doesn't
she look great? You look great.

1121
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:07,259
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

1122
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:09,219
I... Yeah.

1123
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:12,889
- I gotta go.
- Yeah, me, too. Me, too.

1124
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:15,809
- All right, well, maybe some other time.
- Yeah.

1125
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:18,094
Good seeing you. Good bumping
into you like that. Weird.

1126
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:20,105
Take care.

1127
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:27,946
- Oh, my God. You're falling for her.
- What?

1128
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:31,116
- You're falling for your wife! You idiot!
- What are you talking about?

1129
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,827
- She's a wily temptress.
- "A wily temptress."

1130
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:35,287
- Yes!
- You just said "wily temptress."

1131
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,247
Yes, I did, because
that is what she is.

1132
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:40,125
And what do wily
temptresses do, Jack?

1133
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:44,337
They tempt in a wily fashion.
And then they play you.

1134
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:49,217
Tempt, play, tempt, play. And
she's playing you, my friend.

1135
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:52,470
Don't let her play you out
of what is rightfully yours.

1136
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:56,641
Keep your eyes on the prize, Jack!
Eyes on the prize.

1137
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,695
Hey, McNally. What'd you
do, take the weekend off?

1138
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:09,905
- Oh...
- Have fun?

1139
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:12,157
No, I remember when I didn't
care about my career, either.

1140
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:16,244
I'm sorry, I just had this thing this
weekend with my husband's family...

1141
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,163
Your husband?
You got married?

1142
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:20,498
Well, thanks for the invite. I didn't
even know you had a boyfriend.

1143
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:22,876
Yeah, no, I'm married.
I didn't tell you that?

1144
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:25,962
No, you didn't. I guess
you're not a big sharer.

1145
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:28,298
Now, listen, Joy, I've been in
this business for a long time.

1146
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:31,468
And the thing that I value most
in my employees is honesty.

1147
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:35,013
So I'm gonna be honest with you.
Right now, you and Chong are tied.

1148
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:38,016
Now, Chonger is bringing her
husband to the retreat.

1149
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:41,686
- I think you should bring yours, too.
- He will be there.

1150
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:44,814
- You can count on it, sir.
- Good.

1151
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:51,655
No?

1152
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:56,034
No. I have a lot of stuff
to do this weekend,

1153
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,994
and while the idea of hanging
out with you and playing house

1154
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,248
in front of all your boring
co-workers sounds not fun at all,

1155
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:04,417
I'm going to have to pass.

1156
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:09,923
This is really important
for my promotion. You see,

1157
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:13,885
my boss said that he
wants to meet my husband

1158
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:17,514
so I just promised him
that you would be there.

1159
01:06:17,598 --> 01:06:19,933
Maybe you should
have asked me first.

1160
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,185
Okay.

1161
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:26,398
- I need this, Jack.
- I need a lot of things, Joy.

1162
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:32,779
So let me get this straight.

1163
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:36,449
She asked you to come to
a retreat for her job.

1164
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:37,826
Yeah.

1165
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:40,870
The most important thing
to her in the world.

1166
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:44,624
Do you believe that?
I was like, "No!"

1167
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:52,507
'Cause I'm like... I'm like,
"Hey, what are you still doing here?"

1168
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:56,344
Jack! You have got to get
your ass down there,

1169
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:59,055
pretend to be the perfect husband,
charm them all, and then,

1170
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,933
when you have them eating out
of the palm of your hand,

1171
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,935
you make her sign this.

1172
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:07,605
- What's this?
- This is a document, okay,

1173
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:11,192
relinquishing all the
rights to the money.

1174
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:16,865
Right? You tell her if she doesn't sign it,
you're gonna out her in front of everybody.

1175
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,410
Yeah.

1176
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:23,872
I mean, that's not, you know...

1177
01:07:23,956 --> 01:07:26,082
It's not pretty, but we can...

1178
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:28,334
I can laminate it.

1179
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:35,800
- I don't know.
- Okay, look, Jack, the hearing's in a week.

1180
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,011
Okay? This is our last shot.

1181
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:00,992
- Hey, McNally.
- Mr. Banger.

1182
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:02,648
So, where's this
husband of yours?

1183
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:05,497
I just met Chonger's husband.
He's a very smart guy.

1184
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:07,665
He's a tool, but he's smart.

1185
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:09,501
He's...

1186
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:15,465
So the spaceman says,
"I don't even have a vagina!"

1187
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:16,925
He's there!

1188
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:20,637
I'll just take this to him.

1189
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:24,891
Mr. Banger, I just wanted
to take this moment

1190
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:27,519
to express to you my gratitude.

1191
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,730
I'll be seeing you at the...

1192
01:08:31,148 --> 01:08:32,357
The dining table.

1193
01:08:32,983 --> 01:08:34,359
- Hey, hey!
- Hey.

1194
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:38,071
I'm so glad to see you.

1195
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:39,823
Muffin, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

1196
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:43,368
This is why everyone should
have their wife on LoJack.

1197
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:46,871
Let me introduce you to my friends.
This is David Young, your CFO.

1198
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,957
Mr. Young. An honor. Hi.

1199
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:51,709
And this is the rest of
your board, actually.

1200
01:08:52,002 --> 01:08:54,921
Great people. Wealthy people.
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

1201
01:08:57,174 --> 01:08:58,633
So you're the lucky guy.

1202
01:08:58,717 --> 01:09:01,344
- Hi. Jack Fuller.
- I'm Richard Banger.

1203
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:04,055
You're in my seat.

1204
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,600
Wait, your name is
Richard Banger?

1205
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:10,061
Your name is Dick Banger.

1206
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:11,980
Dick Banger! Dick Banger?

1207
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:16,109
You, sir, have just provided us
with jokes for the whole weekend!

1208
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:22,824
Well, you must be Jack... off!

1209
01:09:22,908 --> 01:09:24,659
Jack-Off! Give it to me, baby!

1210
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:26,953
- Jack-Off, buddy!
- He has a comeback!

1211
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,789
McNally, where have you
been hiding this guy?

1212
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:31,666
You know, I've just been
keeping him all to myself!

1213
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,150
Well, you gotta
learn how to share.

1214
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:37,297
All right, everybody, let's sit down.
Brainiac, Chonger, move over.

1215
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:41,384
"Jack-Off." How about it?
Oh, boy.

1216
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:45,680
I don't know what made you change your
mind, and I don't need to. I just...

1217
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:47,098
Thank you.

1218
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:53,062
- "Jack-Off." I love that.
- Yeah, I do, too.

1219
01:09:56,650 --> 01:10:00,236
I love that, that you said that.
Because it was...

1220
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:03,114
For a moment there, I...

1221
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,532
I'm so sorry.

1222
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:07,035
Joy, come on over! Joy!

1223
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:09,871
I'm on it!

1224
01:10:10,831 --> 01:10:13,041
- Yeah!
- I'm on it.

1225
01:10:15,836 --> 01:10:17,462
Yeah! Yeah!

1230
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:37,899
- No, not yet.
- You better not be pussying out on me!

1231
01:10:37,983 --> 01:10:40,652
Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'm
just waiting for her to get down here.

1232
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:42,737
Got to warm these
people up, you know?

1233
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:44,948
All right, well, call me
when it's done, okay?

1234
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:46,241
I'm holding down the
fort in the meantime.

1235
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:47,367
- Yeah. All right.
- Bye.

1236
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,622
Lavender.

1237
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:55,541
You get on my head.

1238
01:10:58,013 --> 01:11:02,232
Oh, my God. That is slick.
That is something else.

1239
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,919
- Can you believe this?
- No.

1240
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:45,550
I guess I was wrong.
You do clean up pretty well.

1241
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:50,763
What?

1242
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:54,309
No, you just... You...

1243
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:57,145
I like your hair like that.

1244
01:11:58,105 --> 01:11:59,355
Thanks.

1245
01:11:59,898 --> 01:12:01,691
Can I get two shots?

1246
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:03,860
You know what? Make it three.

1247
01:12:03,944 --> 01:12:06,446
Hello, McNally. Jack-Off,
how are you doing?

1248
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:09,186
- Hey, Mr. Banger.
- How are you?

1249
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,241
Good.

1250
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:11,909
Cheers.

1251
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:18,166
"Hello, my name is Joy's Bitch."

1252
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:23,546
How's it going tonight?
You guys having fun?

1253
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:27,759
That's a good one, McNally.
I had no idea you were so much fun.

1254
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:29,052
She's very serious at work.

1255
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:31,512
You don't know her that well.
This one's a wildcat.

1256
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:35,641
- I wouldn't lie to you, Big Dick.
- Well, if you did, I'd have to kill you.

1257
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,852
- Seriously.
- There's nothing this woman loves

1258
01:12:37,936 --> 01:12:39,257
- more than a good dare.
- Really?

1259
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:41,189
Yeah. You ever see what she can
do with a champagne bottle?

1260
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:44,734
- Unbelievable. Shocking.
- No, it's just... It's a party trick. It's not...

1261
01:12:44,818 --> 01:12:46,194
I dare you.

1262
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:54,952
- I hate you.
- You love me.

1263
01:12:57,915 --> 01:12:59,999
Very good! Very good!

1264
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:02,960
Terrific! You know, had I
seen this side of you before,

1265
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:06,297
I probably would have
promoted you a long time ago.

really don't wanna dance.

1270
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:21,771
You know what?
You shouldn't do that.

1271
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:24,649
You've got this, okay?

1272
01:13:25,692 --> 01:13:27,276
Throw the dice.

1273
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:29,779

1278
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:42,917
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

We're... Okay.

1281
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:50,383
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen,
would you please gather round?

1282
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:55,763
Come on. Don't be afraid.
This year's Golden Handshake Award

1283

goes to a new face,

1284
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:04,063
and one of the funniest son of a bitches
I've ever had the pleasure to know.

1285
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:06,357
And I think you know
who I'm talking about.

1286
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:11,529
- Jack-Off! Jack-Off! Jack-Off!
- Jack-Off! Jack-Off! Jack-Off!

1287
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:13,656
Get up here! Come on!

1288
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:17,618
Congratulations, Jack-Off.

1289
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:22,790
Well, thank you all for
an amazing weekend. I...

1290
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:27,211
I have to thank my wife, Joy.

1291
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:36,012
She probably never told you all
the story about how we met.

1292
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:44,604
It might come as a
surprise to many of you

1293
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:49,442
that we didn't know each other for
very long before we got hitched.

1294
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:58,951
What can I say? You know?
When you know, you know.

1295
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:05,291
On our wedding night, we were so busy
running back to the honeymoon suite

1296
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:10,046
that we never really got a
chance to have a first dance.

1297
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:11,756
So...

1298
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:16,219

1299
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:19,514

I think that means
they want us to kiss.

When's the last time you
were, like, really happy?

1332
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:32,772
- Really happy?
- And don't say Vegas,

1333
01:17:32,856 --> 01:17:36,233
because if you do, I'll just...
I'll have to cry.

1334
01:17:38,111 --> 01:17:39,236
Okay.

1335
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:42,907
There was this one day,

1336
01:17:43,867 --> 01:17:46,285
before the Exchange,
before Mason.

1337
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:52,166
I was feeling really
adventurous, so I took the ferry

1338
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:55,086
- about 30 miles east of the city.
- Mmm-hmm.

1339
01:17:55,629 --> 01:17:57,380
There was this great lighthouse.

1340
01:17:57,464 --> 01:18:01,092
I mean, it was just right on
the beach, off the boardwalk.

1341
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,511
- You went there by yourself?
- Yeah.

1342
01:18:03,595 --> 01:18:06,389
You know, I just, like,
sat on the beach,

1343
01:18:07,432 --> 01:18:10,810
listened to the waves,
watched the sunset.

1344
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:16,857
God! I had no concerns, you know?
I had, like, no responsibilities,

1345
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:18,734
no job stressing me out.

1346
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:21,946
I had no one to
please but myself.

1347
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:25,408
- That's that photo you have.
- Yeah.

1348
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:29,704
That was a great day.

1349
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:49,390
I did take myself
out of the game.

1350
01:18:55,313 --> 01:18:57,356
If you stop betting,

1351
01:18:58,442 --> 01:19:00,317
you never have to lose.

1352
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,541
I'd bet on you, Jack.

1353
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:32,183
So, long day, huh?

1354
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:34,143
Yeah.

1355
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:39,899
So, we should
probably get to bed.

1356
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:43,068
Yep.

1357
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:05,382
Can you undo my zipper?

1358
01:20:06,009 --> 01:20:08,886
- It gets stuck.
- Yeah! Yeah.

1359
01:20:09,763 --> 01:20:11,138
Absolutely.

1360
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:17,645
All right.

1361
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:33,702
All right. Okay. There it is.

1362
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:39,834
Thanks.

1363
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:10,614
Hey, I... These...

1364
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:14,285
- I wasn't in your things.
- It's okay. Just leave them right there.

1365
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:16,120
I can put them back.

1366
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:23,961
Good night, Mr. Fuller.

1367
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:26,463

01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:27,691
It's almost over. I'm
about to be a free woman.

1376
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:30,402
- Joy. Joy!
- What?

1377
01:22:31,696 --> 01:22:33,155
I have to go.

1378
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:34,949
- Mason?
- Yeah.

1379
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:40,746
I can't talk right now. I'm sorry.
I have to get going. I just...

1380
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:42,665
I want you back, Joy.

1381
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,961
- What?
- I made a huge mistake letting you go.

1382
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:48,712
I see that now.

1383
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:52,007
Seeing you the other day, you
had this glow about you.

1384
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:54,843
Not that you didn't
before, it's just...

1385
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:57,054
Sometimes it takes
losing something

1386
01:22:57,138 --> 01:22:59,473
for you to realize what you had.

1387
01:23:00,183 --> 01:23:03,102
I want to make up for
the wrong I did to you.

1388
01:23:04,562 --> 01:23:06,063
This is yours.

1389
01:23:06,731 --> 01:23:09,608
I gave it to you, and I
want you to have it.

1390
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:14,154
- Where did you get this?
- And Joy,

1391
01:23:15,907 --> 01:23:18,117
you are good enough for me.

1392
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:31,588
I mean that!

1393
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:50,232
Court is called to order.

1394
01:23:51,067 --> 01:23:54,111
Well, lookie here, lookie here!
The happy couple!

1395
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:57,948
Six months down the road.
Did you learn anything?

1396
01:23:58,533 --> 01:23:59,575
We'll see.

1397
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:02,786
Now, Dr. Twitchell, in your
opinion, did the couple,

1398
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,913
Jack Fuller and Joy McNally,

1399
01:24:04,998 --> 01:24:07,708
obey the court order to live
together as man and wife,

1400
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:11,211
and do you believe they put
sufficient effort into the marriage?

1401
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:17,718
These two have

1402
01:24:20,638 --> 01:24:22,264
a lot of issues.

1403
01:24:22,682 --> 01:24:26,310
A lot of deeply
unsettling issues

1404
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:30,105
that, as individuals, they
seriously need to work on.

1405
01:24:31,107 --> 01:24:32,441
Seriously.

1406
01:24:33,985 --> 01:24:36,820
But together,
in my honest opinion,

1407
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:40,491
they're perfect for each other.

1408
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:42,326
It's the real thing.

1409
01:24:43,286 --> 01:24:44,620
Go figure.

1410
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:49,166
Well, thank you, Doctor.
You may step down.

1411
01:24:52,003 --> 01:24:53,337
Tipper!

1412
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:02,096
Hi, Your Honor.

1413
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:04,515
Have you lost weight?

1414
01:25:06,601 --> 01:25:08,352
Gotcha. Let's begin.

1415
01:25:08,978 --> 01:25:14,066
Although Ms. McNally ran up $25,000 in
credit card debt in my client's name,

1416
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:16,819
my client recently
spent the same amount

1417
01:25:16,903 --> 01:25:19,863
for materials for his
new furniture business.

1418
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:23,242
Therefore, we propose the
following settlement, Your Honor.

1419
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:25,869
The original $3 million,
deduct half for taxes

1420
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:28,664
and $50,000 that's
already been spent,

1421
01:25:28,748 --> 01:25:31,750
that leaves $1 .45
million to be divided...

1422
01:25:36,714 --> 01:25:37,923
equally.

1423
01:25:38,007 --> 01:25:41,885
Now that's the spirit! You've
learned to share! Do you accept?

1424
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,602
No, Your Honor, we do not.

1425
01:25:51,771 --> 01:25:53,522
Gold-digging whore.

1426
01:25:53,606 --> 01:25:57,568
My client has advised me that she
doesn't want any of the money.

1427
01:25:58,486 --> 01:26:00,445
She just wants a divorce.

1428
01:26:01,364 --> 01:26:03,490
Miss McNally, are you sure?

1429
01:26:06,452 --> 01:26:07,995
Yes, your Honor, I am.

1430
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:13,083
Well, then I hereby grant the divorce
and award all the monies to Mr. Fuller.

1431
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:15,377
Court adjourned.

1432
01:26:20,925 --> 01:26:22,509
You win, Jack.

1433
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:25,095
I officially want
nothing from you.

1434
01:26:32,061 --> 01:26:33,604
Oh, my God.

1435
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:36,732
I won a case! Jesus Christ!

1436
01:26:36,816 --> 01:26:38,859
Dude, we won!

1437
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:40,360
I won!

1438
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:43,197
Yeah! I'm the law, bitches!

1439
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:44,865
I'm a lawyer!

1440
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:46,783
To me!

1441
01:26:47,535 --> 01:26:49,369
Anybody need a lawyer?

Time heals all wounds.

1445
01:27:03,134 --> 01:27:07,971
Now that you guys are officially done,
is there any chance I can get her number.

1446
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:10,974
E-mail is fine.

1447
01:27:12,685 --> 01:27:14,478
Go ahead, run it.

1448
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:21,985
Have any idea what her plans are
going to be for the future?

1449
01:27:25,949 --> 01:27:27,324
Yeah, okay.

1450
01:27:27,742 --> 01:27:30,452
You don't have to
answer that right now.

1451
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:36,667
Hey, I have a question.

1452
01:27:37,835 --> 01:27:39,920
How much does an island cost?

1453
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:51,181
Now we come to the
final item on our agenda.

1454
01:27:53,101 --> 01:27:55,102
Congratulations, McNally.

1455
01:27:57,855 --> 01:28:00,482
Thank you, sir.
I won't let you down.

1456
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:09,366
Okay, I think I'm gonna
have to let you down.

1457
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:11,952
Why don't you just give
it to Chong, you know?

1458
01:28:12,036 --> 01:28:13,453
She's good, she deserves it,

1459
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:15,998
and besides, I think she
just enjoys being miserable.

1460
01:28:16,374 --> 01:28:18,583
- Yes!
- You sure you know what you're doing?

1461
01:28:18,668 --> 01:28:21,628
No, I don't. But I think
that's the point.

1462
01:28:22,922 --> 01:28:25,549
I would rather do
nothing and be happy

1463
01:28:26,426 --> 01:28:29,011
than do something
that I don't love.

1464
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:43,817
Well, I lost her at happy.

1465
01:28:43,901 --> 01:28:45,652
I don't know what the hell she
was trying to say anyway.

1466
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:48,238
Well done, Chonger.
The job is yours.

1467
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:53,327
Thank you.

1468
01:28:53,911 --> 01:28:55,996
So! Jack made a
piece of furniture.

1469
01:28:56,998 --> 01:28:58,415
He finished it.

1470
01:28:58,499 --> 01:29:00,167
Okay. Go ahead, Dad.
What's wrong with it?

1471
01:29:00,251 --> 01:29:01,710
Nothing. It's good.

1472
01:29:01,794 --> 01:29:04,087
It's really good.
I'm proud of you.

1473
01:29:07,258 --> 01:29:08,467
- Thank you.
- But...

1474
01:29:08,551 --> 01:29:09,551
Here we go.

1475
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:11,178
...you royally screwed up
when it comes to that girl.

1476
01:29:11,262 --> 01:29:15,057
It was a big, stupid mistake. Okay?
The entire marriage was a lie!

1477
01:29:15,141 --> 01:29:17,684
The marriage might have been a
mistake, but it was not a lie.

1478
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:20,562
And I think that anybody who has
spent time with you two recently

1479
01:29:20,646 --> 01:29:21,730
could tell you that.

1480
01:29:21,814 --> 01:29:25,025
So why don't you get your
head out of your ass

1481
01:29:25,109 --> 01:29:27,277
and go do something about it?

1482
01:29:27,904 --> 01:29:31,281
Or should I tell you not to,
and then maybe you will?

1483
01:29:34,577 --> 01:29:37,245
- She's gone, man.
- Gone? What do you mean, gone?

1484
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:41,666
She, like, lost it. She quit her job,
shut off her phone. She took off.

1485
01:29:41,918 --> 01:29:43,919
Look, I don't really
care much for you,

1486
01:29:44,003 --> 01:29:45,844
and I want to cut your friend Hater.
Seriously.

1487
01:29:45,922 --> 01:29:47,172
But for some reason,

1488
01:29:47,256 --> 01:29:50,217
you're, like, the only man that
Joy can actually be herself with,

1489
01:29:50,301 --> 01:29:54,262
so I wanna tell you where she is,
I really do. I just don't know.

1490
01:29:54,847 --> 01:29:56,848
- What do you know?
- I don't know. If you were miserable

1491
01:29:56,933 --> 01:30:00,435
and you wanted to get happy
again, where would you go?

1492
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:03,313
What?

1493
01:30:05,024 --> 01:30:06,358
Thank you.

1494
01:30:09,612 --> 01:30:11,947
Okay, tell you what. We both go.

1495
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:13,520
That way, when she sees us both,

1496
01:30:13,533 --> 01:30:16,076
she can make up her mind on
who she wants to be with.

1497
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:20,038
I've loaned you my band saw,
I've loaned you my beer tap.

1498
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:21,665
Do you even know how
to drive an automatic?

1499
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:23,417
The keys. Give me the keys.

1500
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:24,918
Here. Sorry.

1501
01:30:25,461 --> 01:30:27,838
Go get your future ex-ex-wife.

You found me.

1517
01:32:05,937 --> 01:32:07,729
You left this behind,

1518
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:12,817
and I wanted to bring
it back to you.

1519
01:32:18,282 --> 01:32:22,160
Do you know how many lighthouses
there are 30 miles east of the city?

1520
01:32:22,245 --> 01:32:23,995
- How many?
- Five.

1521
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,957
- Really?
- Yeah, just in case you're wondering.

1522
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:28,083
So.

1523
01:32:29,293 --> 01:32:34,839
Did you come all the way out here
just to give this back to me?

1524
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,510
I did. So I'm going
to get out of here.

1525
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:43,223
All right. Here it is.

1526
01:32:44,183 --> 01:32:46,810
When we were married,
I was horrible.

1527
01:32:47,603 --> 01:32:50,230
Sick. Just wrong.

1528
01:32:52,441 --> 01:32:55,026
And it's the best
time I've ever had.

1529
01:32:58,698 --> 01:33:01,032
You bet on me, Joy,

1530
01:33:03,661 --> 01:33:06,288
and you made me want
to bet on myself.

1531
01:33:06,706 --> 01:33:10,000
So don't think about anyone else

1532
01:33:10,501 --> 01:33:13,503
and just answer this for you.

1533
01:33:22,221 --> 01:33:24,556
Do you want to be married to me?

1534
01:33:25,641 --> 01:33:26,808
Again?

1535
01:33:29,395 --> 01:33:30,687
You know,

1536
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:35,191
for so long, I've just... I've
tried to please everybody.

1537
01:33:35,693 --> 01:33:38,778
And by not trying to please you,

1538
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:43,658
I think I became myself again.

1539
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:47,912
I do

1540
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:52,876
want to be married to you again.

1541
01:34:19,403 --> 01:34:20,862
I quit my job.

1542
01:34:22,073 --> 01:34:23,281
I heard.

1543
01:34:23,532 --> 01:34:26,951
I have absolutely no idea what
I'm going to do. No clue.

1544
01:34:27,078 --> 01:34:31,706
Well, it's a good thing that I have...
That we have a ton of money.

1545
01:34:31,791 --> 01:34:33,458
Oh, my God!

1546
01:34:35,211 --> 01:34:38,421
That's right.
We hit the jackpot.

1547
01:34:39,173 --> 01:34:40,507
Yeah, I did.

1548
01:34:45,596 --> 01:34:48,515
Now, Joy, do you
take this young man

1549
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:54,270
to be your lawfully wedded husband,
in sickness and in health,

1550
01:34:54,605 --> 01:34:55,605
Uh-huh.

1551
01:34:55,731 --> 01:34:57,774
For richer or for poorer...

1552
01:34:58,776 --> 01:35:00,068
I do. I take him.

1553
01:35:00,152 --> 01:35:01,986
Naughty! Naughty!

1554
01:35:02,071 --> 01:35:04,989
Jack, would you put the
ring upon her finger?

1555
01:35:05,908 --> 01:35:08,368
- Was that the one?
- That was it! Oh, my God!

1556
01:35:08,452 --> 01:35:10,245
You may kiss the bride.

1557
01:35:12,248 --> 01:35:13,915
This is the greatest
day of my life!

1558
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:18,002
- This is the greatest day of my...
- What? What?

1559
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:21,005
Oh, my...

1560
01:35:21,215 --> 01:35:22,716
This is marvelous,
simply marvelous.

1561
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,843
- Bye! Thank you!
- Bye-bye.

1562
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:26,678
Have fun, you guys!

1563
01:35:26,762 --> 01:35:28,388
It's so much fun in there!
You guys are gonna love it!

1564
01:35:28,472 --> 01:35:30,557
- Woman!
- Holy shit.

1565
01:35:30,641 --> 01:35:32,684
- Woman!
- I'm coming!

1566
01:35:34,645 --> 01:35:35,812
