1
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,657
Stay on the beacon!
Manolo, we lost the beacon.

2
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,742
My God! My God!

3
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,871
What's our heading?
I don't know.

4
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,747
We lost all navigation.

5
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,792
Pull the nose up!
I can't!

6
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,419
Come on, pool is closed, everyone.
Out of the water.

7
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:32,171
Stow that gear and get out of here.

8
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:36,300
Get these divers out of the water.
Let's go, let's go. Come on, back here.

9
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,635
Taking too long.
Watch your step. Here you go.

10
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:41,471
Assholes and elbows, that's all.
You all right?

11
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,933
Where's that fat guy's weight belt?
That's coming out of your pay, Jared.

12
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,727
Would you shut up for two seconds?

13
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,354
If I wanted that kind of lip,
I'd drop my fly. Let's go.

14
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,399
What about my weight belt?
Those are 60 bucks a pop.

15
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,568
You want me to take that out
of your paycheck?

16
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,279
I'll tell you what, Bob.
I got him in, you get him out.

17
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:08,248
Here at the Atlantis, we have the
largest marine habitat in the world.

18
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,460
The nurse sharks in this habitat
grow up to 14 feet...

19
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:14,129
...and feed differently
than most other sharks.

20
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:17,716
They suck in their prey
with one powerful inhalation...

21
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:20,093
...and they swallow it
pretty much whole.

22
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,430
Do you guys hear that?
Yeah.

23
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,015
Did you ever get bit?

24
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:28,644
Yeah, Gina here got a little too frisky
with me one day last year.

25
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:32,981
But for the most part, shark attacks are
just a simple case of mistaken identity.

26
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,302
Hey, Boone.

27
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,560
What's your daddy up to?

28
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,035
Hey.
Hey.

29
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,746
Smells good over there.
What?

30
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,582
Smells good in there.

31
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,002
Yeah, that's my famous chili
and corn bread.

32
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,132
What?

33
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,384
Last time you made your chili
and corn bread...

34
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:43,927
...your ex-girlfriend was here.

35
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,181
Then, the time before that,
you brought home a pregnant...

36
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,474
...flea-infested, three-legged dog.

37
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,895
Last time a storm came through here,
like that last one...

38
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,897
Kam Jackson...
You remember Kam Jackson?

39
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,609
Found that golden cross, remember,
on the north side of the island?

40
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,195
That hurricane that came through
moved so much sand...

41
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,363
...who knows how many
shipwrecks it uncovered?

42
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,283
So this is where
your chili comes in?

43
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,285
I'm saying I should be
out prospecting.

44
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,078
Quit your job?

45
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,498
No, I was fired,
but it's all part of the plan.

46
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:16,418
I'm just gonna get this thing going,
get the boat shaped up...

47
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:20,130
...make a big find, and we'll live
the rest of our lives on our own clock.

48
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:23,091
I thought we already were.
Yeah, but we'll be rich.

49
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,470
You okay?

50
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:30,140
Here, let me see.

51
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,729
I'm all right.

52
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,273
Honey...
Stinking boat.

53
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:42,277
You know I'd live on this
broken boat with you, right?

54
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,240
I love it when you say stuff like that.

55
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,004
Hey. Hey.

56
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:03,924
You guys okay?

57
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,510
Yeah.

58
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:09,888
Yeah, we're good, man.
Just plugging a few holes, you know?

59
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,350
Sea Robin looks great.
Yeah, we just finished it.

60
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,477
We got her out to sea
before the storm hit.

61
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:18,438
We've been working every day since.
What are you looking for?

62
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,482
They found the Titanic.
You didn't hear?

63
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,276
Oh, you mean the one
with the dishes?

64
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,654
No, I only hunt for stuff that comes
in gold and silver. You know that.

65
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,656
Hey, Sam.

66
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,909
Here.

67
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,998
Found it this morning
where we were blowing a site.

68
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:38,542
Maybe this guy can find a stone
to put in that thing.

69
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:42,045
Hey, I'm sorry about your boat.
You want my guy to take a look at it?

70
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,506
I think it's looking good.
Got it under control.

71
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,800
All right.
Well, the least I can do is offer.

72
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,178
Word on the water
is you're out of work.

73
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,346
You can always come back
and work for me.

74
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,056
No. I got my own thing going now.

75
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,726
But if you wanna subcontract me,
that's cool.

76
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:58,729
We can work something out.
Like a fifty-fifty thing, you know?

77
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:02,524
You don't just take a rowboat out and
find a treasure chest filled with gold.

78
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,694
It took me almost 10 years of scraping
till I found my first haul.

79
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:08,071
Hey, I mean what I say.

80
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,657
You need help getting back
in the water, let me know.

81
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,826
Move it out.
Hey, Quinn.

82
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,163
You wanna come work for a real
captain, you let me know, all right?

83
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,583
Are you a captain now? You know,
the water goes outside of the boat.

84
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,046
We'll see you, Sam.

85
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,538
You know I can't slave
for Bates again.

86
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,748
I know that.

87
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,086
There's no way I'm gonna
bust my ass while he gets rich.

88
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,088
Meanwhile, he's blasting holes
in the reef.

89
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:09,132
I just don't operate that way.
I know, honey.

90
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,593
I just want you to be happy, okay?

91
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,095
You know that.

92
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:15,722
Yeah?
Yeah.

93
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:50,090
Welcome to the Bahamas.
It's a pleasure having you here.

94
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,925
Thank you.
Welcome to paradise.

95
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,760
It's a pleasure having you here, sir.

96
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,430
It's a pleasure having me here too.
Thank you.

97
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,015
Business or pleasure?

98
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,310
Come on, bro, what do you think?

99
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,646
Enjoy your stay.

100
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,111
No way.

101
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,488
It's Mr. OG Wannabe.

102
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,866
What's up, you scruffy
little beach rat?

103
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,326
Okay.

104
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,454
I'm gonna throw your ass
right now. Watch.

105
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,916
Go to sleep, go to sleep.
Okay, okay.

106
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,959
All right.

107
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:28,253
You've been spending
too much time in court.

108
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,672
Wait, hold on, hold on.
Don't move for a second.

109
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,592
Oh, that feels really good.

110
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,552
You sick-ass.

111
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,387
What's up?
Good to see you.

112
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,098
Good to see you too, bro.
How's New York treating you?

113
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:43,101
It's paying me. A lot of bad guys
need defending, I defend them.

114
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:46,522
That's what I do.
That's still a scary thought.

115
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,399
Oh, my God. Can I get a what-what
and a side of french fries?

116
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:53,195
Look at that body.
It's ridiculous. Holy shit.

117
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:55,531
How much have you missed me?
Oh, every minute.

118
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:59,451
Oh, my God, it's so tight too.
It's like that everywhere, even.

119
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:02,329
It's good to see you, Sam.
If we had met first, you and l...

120
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,540
...things would be a lot different,
you know.

121
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,500
Easy, cheesy.

122
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,586
Anyway. Okay, so you must be Lisa?

123
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:14,258
Who's Lisa?
Yeah, who the hell is Lisa?

124
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,177
Amanda. Amanda.

125
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,805
Amanda.
Hi, Amanda. I'm Sam.

126
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:22,266
Welcome to the Bahamas.
Hi. Nice to meet you, Sam.

127
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,767
I'm Jared.
Amanda.

128
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:26,436
Sorry about that.
Let's go. These guys are ridiculous.

129
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:31,233
You're such an idiot.
Decent save. You did good.

130
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,693
No, that was horrible.

131
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,278
I love the Caribbean.

132
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,947
Too hot to wear shirts,
too hot to wear pants...

133
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:39,616
...and we're two hot young ladies.

134
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,995
You dive?
Yeah, I can keep up.

135
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,664
So how long you known
this one for?

136
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,584
I don't know, about 14 hours now.

137
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,460
Picked her up last night
at The Mercer...

138
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:54,173
I picked you up last night.
Don't start lying already.

139
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:58,468
So you and Bryce.
I think I'm in love. Serious.

140
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:01,263
I'm not serious.

141
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,393
The guy who owned this place got hit
with 44 counts of racketeering...

142
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,062
...and money laundering.
Our firm represented him.

143
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,815
This is how he floated the bill.
You gotta be kidding me.

144
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:16,612
Boat problem? No problem.
Boat and skis come with the crib.

145
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,989
We get the boat?
You know how Daddy does it.

146
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,782
We get the boat?
We get the boat.

147
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,452
We get the boat! We get the boat!

148
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,987
Let's see it, bro, come on.
Oh, my gosh.

149
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,120
There he goes.

150
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,125
How you like me now?

151
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,921
That was so hot.

152
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:07,556
How sick was that?
That was amazing.

153
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,371
Where are we?
It's our secret spot.

154
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,332
Amazing, isn't it?

155
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,897
Shark, dude. Get out of the water.
There's a shark.

156
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,482
Come on.

157
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,275
Jared, get out. It's a shark.

158
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:03,779
Come on, swim. Swim to me,
swim to me, Jared, swim to me.

159
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,989
Get out, get out.
Come on, come on, get out.

160
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:09,409
What are you laughing at? Get out.
There are sharks everywhere, look.

161
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,286
Give me my mask
and my fins real quick.

162
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:14,790
You... No, you don't need a mask.
There's a shark. He looks like Jaws.

163
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,583
Get out.
Yeah, but I lost my watch.

164
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,669
You lost...?
You need an arm to wear a watch.

165
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:20,546
Would you get out
of the water, stupid?

166
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:23,340
Sam gave me it for my birthday.
I don't care. Sam, get...

167
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:25,634
What are you doing?
They're just curious.

168
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:28,470
Curious as to what? As to what?
What his ass tastes like?

169
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:31,515
Dude, get out. Seri...
Oh, my God, look at that. That shark.

170
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:34,726
Hold on. Hold.
Sam, what is he doing?

171
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,145
Right there, right there.

172
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:39,898
You cool?

173
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:43,652
Don't do that.
Come on, don't do that.

174
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,320
It's not funny?
No.

175
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:53,889
Look. Look what I found.

176
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:56,099
No way. That's a rock, honey.

177
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,852
Three-minute breath-hold
and the guy comes up with a rock.

178
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:03,106
I mean, what are the odds of that?
Wait till I tell the boys at the office.

179
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,442
No, that's a ballast stone, man.

180
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,778
Ships used to carry them
in their hull.

181
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:11,240
Wow, right.
Well, I got a box of Cohibas...

182
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:15,452
...and some rum from back in the day
over on the land part of Earth. Let's...

183
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,246
Let's handle it over there,
you know?

184
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:20,374
He always finds these things.
It's the ship that's always missing.

185
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,585
Help me out. Let's get back in
the water before the sun goes down.

186
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:25,838
Really? You think there's
something down there?

187
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,381
I don't know. Grab your stuff.

188
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:28,715
Hold on. Are you insane?

189
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,927
You think I'm going back in there
with those things? I'm mad at you.

190
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:34,721
They're not aggressive.
It's tiger sharks you should avoid.

191
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,516
Yeah, she's right.
Those tiger sharks are bad news.

192
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:40,602
Those are the ones that are furry
and have the stripes on them.

193
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,438
That was a joke.
He's funny now, this guy. Okay.

194
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,566
Yeah, no,
I'm not getting in the water.

195
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,428
It's gold, right?

196
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,050
You find something?

197
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:41,969
Yeah.

198
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:45,556
What?
A plane.

199
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:48,058
Like an airplane?

200
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:50,561
Yeah, like an airplane.

201
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,855
Well, that's odd.

202
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:41,880
How many of these
do you think are down there?

203
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:44,591
I don't know, enough bricks
to build a house.

204
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,803
A multimillion-dollar
cocaine palace.

205
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,183
With a pool and a waterfall and
a giraffe nibbling on the front yard.

206
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,727
How about a prison cell
with no sunlight for 10 years?

207
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:05,320
Yeah, we're out of here.

208
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,699
Jared, what about this?

209
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:13,453
What-y-what-what?
Come on, Amanda, don't be stupid.

210
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,165
Oh, we're not gonna get caught.
You're right, we're not.

211
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,000
Come on. It's for us.
Come on, relax.

212
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:20,002
I am.
We'll save it for a rainy day.

213
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:21,920
Or a rainy month.
Come on, seriously.

214
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:24,131
Maybe a sunny day?
Let me see it real quick.

215
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:26,717
Hey, Sam. Come here.
Hey. Wait, wait.

216
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:29,011
Come here, come here.
Sam, Sam, stop.

217
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:32,347
Let's just let the defense present
its case for a second.

218
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:34,099
All right.
I don't do drugs.

219
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:35,642
I hate drugs.
Sure.

220
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:39,188
But throwing this away, I don't know.
Maybe I object. Silly, right?

221
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:41,106
Throwing it away,
doesn't it seem silly?

222
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:43,692
Throwing it in the...
ln the ocean?

223
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:45,402
Trash?
Wait, let me see this.

224
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:48,363
I think, you know, it would be...
What are you doing?

225
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,449
It's going away.

226
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:52,409
Really?
Yeah.

227
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:55,037
Wow, that's intense.

228
00:24:57,623 --> 00:24:59,041
That's a new boat, Jared.

229
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:02,961
That's a new b...
Threw away a new boat. Okay.

230
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:06,006
We're out of here.
Threw a new boat into the ocean.

231
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:08,884
You guys are a lot of fun.

232
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:11,845
You're gonna keep this,
though, right?

233
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:14,306
Yep. Jackass.

234
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:15,724
Okay, good.

235
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:21,230
What do you think, Jared? You think
there's more treasure down there?

236
00:25:21,647 --> 00:25:25,859
Big storms bring big treasure.
Oh, good. What does that mean?

237
00:25:27,236 --> 00:25:30,572
What she's saying is that hurricanes
like the one that came through here...

238
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:33,742
...sometimes what they do is they sift
stuff out that's been buried.

239
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:36,870
Good, so we go back tomorrow
and we dig.

240
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:39,164
Not if we report that plane crash.

241
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:41,041
The place will turn
into a crime scene.

242
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:44,628
Coast Guard, DEA. They'll be all over
it and we'll never get near it again.

243
00:25:44,795 --> 00:25:46,964
What happened to
"finders keepers, losers weepers"?

244
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,216
The law down here
doesn't play by those rules.

245
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:52,177
See, the thing of it is,
you have to file a claim.

246
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:54,930
In order to file a claim,
you have to identify the wreck.

247
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:59,768
We have to be able to name
what it was and where it came from.

248
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:03,772
So like I keep saying, we go down
tomorrow and we dig and we find out.

249
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:06,108
What about the plane?
What about the plane?

250
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:09,236
We found bodies. Don't you think
we should tell someone?

251
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:12,239
They're drug dealers, Sam.
They're not missionaries...

252
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:15,284
...flying care packages
to starving kids in Africa. Okay?

253
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,786
Don't worry. Their girlfriends
will have new pimps...

254
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:20,539
...before the milk in the refrigerator
goes bad. It's fine.

255
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:23,250
Don't you think somebody
wants their lost luggage?

256
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,419
I'm sure that they do,
I'm sure that they do.

257
00:26:25,586 --> 00:26:28,005
All the more reason we need to
keep our mouths closed.

258
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:31,800
Yeah, because, you know,
loose lips, they sink ships.

259
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:34,303
That's right, baby.
Loose lips do sink ships.

260
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:38,682
Now, look, what we do is we go down,
we identify the wreck...

261
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:41,351
...and then we call in the plane.

262
00:26:41,518 --> 00:26:44,897
Right? Unless... Unless you don't have
a problem with somebody else...

263
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:47,316
...laying claim on your treasure.

264
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:51,403
These aren't like those shipwrecks
you have at the bottom of a fish tank.

265
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:55,449
I mean, it could be spread
all over the ocean floor.

266
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,534
She's right.

267
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:02,456
But, Sam, I really think
we can do this.

268
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,293
And the equipment we need
and don't have?

269
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:09,421
That's where Mr. Deep Pockets
comes in.

270
00:27:09,588 --> 00:27:11,006
Right?
That's right.

271
00:27:11,173 --> 00:27:12,841
The Kid.

272
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:18,138
The bottom line is we could
spend the rest of our lives...

273
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:21,058
...waiting for another
opportunity like this.

274
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:26,647
All right.
What?

275
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:29,691
All right.
Come on, excitement, a little bit.

276
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:31,860
Can we have some fun...?
Under one condition.

277
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:34,071
Fine.
We report that plane...

278
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:36,406
...as soon as we can
make a claim...

279
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:39,368
...and we stay the hell away
from it until then.

280
00:27:40,911 --> 00:27:42,204
Don't look at me.

281
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:45,707
Come on, guys. I'll just stay here
and suck on my thumb...

282
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:47,709
...while you play
Pirates of the Caribbean.

283
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,171
All right, one more thing, though.

284
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,714
Not a word to anyone.

285
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:55,509
Okay?

286
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:58,887
Got it, got it, got it. We're good.
Can we drink to this, please?

287
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:02,349
We're gonna be rich, people.
Cheers, big ears.

288
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:06,061
Cheers.
Cheers to being loaded.

289
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:10,357
Check it out, though,
I need a... I need a compressor...

290
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:14,570
...air lifts, four sets of AGA gear,
hookah rigs.

291
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:16,405
You got all that?
Ain't no thing.

292
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:19,491
No? What about a boat that's
already dialed in with electronics?

293
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:22,035
Not a problem.
Please don't put me on hold.

294
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:25,581
I need a magnetometer,
I need a side scan sonar.

295
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:27,916
I can set you up with
that whole boat over there.

296
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,377
Sonar, blower,
the whole ball of wax, man.

297
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:32,337
But you gotta pay.

298
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:34,173
How much?
Thirty grand.

299
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:37,885
Hello? Hello? Are you there?

300
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:40,095
What's he doing?
He's tripping me out.

301
00:28:40,262 --> 00:28:43,390
No, he's the bank. He's putting
together the funds. Thirty grand?

302
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:45,267
Thirty grand.
I'll give you two weeks.

303
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:49,730
I'll carry the note.
You do good, you get the toys.

304
00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:51,940
What do you mean, a meeting?
He's a criminal.

305
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:54,026
Criminals don't have meetings.

306
00:28:54,193 --> 00:28:55,944
Look, no, don't hang...
What's up?

307
00:28:56,153 --> 00:28:59,531
I can't believe this guy. The nerve.
I cannot understand it.

308
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:01,617
I basically saved this guy's life.

309
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:03,744
Ten years at Leavenworth,
and I get him off.

310
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:06,330
He can't float me
a couple thousand dollars.

311
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:07,998
So, what are you saying?

312
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:10,334
You don't have any money?
You're tapped out?

313
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:13,504
Dude, I told you about Vegas.
But you told me it was no big deal.

314
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,340
You told me it wasn't a problem.
I lied. Yeah.

315
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:19,218
I lied. I got a pride problem.
Why didn't you tell me that?

316
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:21,678
Tell you what? What do you
wanna hear, my sob story?

317
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:24,431
Here it is, Jared. I borrowed money
from the wrong people.

318
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:27,351
I took out a loan
and now I'm really weighed down.

319
00:29:27,518 --> 00:29:29,978
Yeah, you should've told me
you didn't have any money.

320
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:31,480
You gonna float my marker?

321
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:34,650
You gonna cash in
all your Subway stamps?

322
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:37,486
I'm just...

323
00:29:38,362 --> 00:29:40,239
Why didn't you tell me, bro?

324
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:42,533
Why did we come here
if you don't have any money?

325
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:44,660
Wasting our time.

326
00:29:44,827 --> 00:29:46,662
This is bullshit.

327
00:29:49,832 --> 00:29:51,542
Bye.

328
00:29:53,043 --> 00:29:54,545
Hey, it's me.

329
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:57,798
I got some info that might kick you
in the balls and make you cough.

330
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:02,357
Yo, check this out.

331
00:33:02,524 --> 00:33:03,525
Look.
Where's Amanda?

332
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:05,527
She's with you.
Give me your tank.

333
00:33:05,736 --> 00:33:07,196
What's going on?
Give me a tank.

334
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:08,697
She's not with you?

335
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,824
Give me that tank. Come on.
Jesus Christ.

336
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:12,367
Come on.
Tank, tank, tank.

337
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:12,302
What are you doing in here?
What do you think I'm doing?

338
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:14,429
I was looking for your stupid ship.

339
00:34:14,596 --> 00:34:18,475
I turned around, and you disappeared.
So I came in here looking for you.

340
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:23,939
What?
I told you to stay away from the plane.

341
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:26,441
I didn't take anything.

342
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:31,405
You wanna search me?
Here, go ahead.

343
00:34:34,116 --> 00:34:35,826
We're out of here.

344
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:45,252
Salt water converts silver
into silver sulfide...

345
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:47,796
...and electrolytic reduction
reverses the process.

346
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:50,966
Whatever, bro. Just hurry up
and turn it back into treasure.

347
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:58,056
It's an old cap-and-ball.
That's a old-school gun right there.

348
00:34:58,223 --> 00:35:01,351
Let me see that.
See the hammer, the trigger?

349
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:04,021
What is this...? These markings?

350
00:35:04,188 --> 00:35:06,064
Give it to the Mexican.
What does that say?

351
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:07,900
You're such an ass.

352
00:35:08,483 --> 00:35:10,152
That's not Spanish.
Let me see it.

353
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:15,949
Oh, it's Latin. "Sic semper tyrannis."

354
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:18,994
"Thus always a tyrant."

355
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:22,372
What? Catholic boarding school.

356
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:24,750
So, what, it's a Roman ship?

357
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:27,211
Seventeenth-century lndian dagger?
I don't think so.

358
00:35:27,628 --> 00:35:29,338
No, this is an American ship.

359
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:31,715
Here it is, right here.

360
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:34,843
"Sic semper tyrannis:
thus ever to tyrants."

361
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,095
You were close.
"The motto of Virginia...

362
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:39,556
...said to have been shouted
by John Wilkes Booth...

363
00:35:39,723 --> 00:35:43,810
...after he had assassinated
Abraham Lincoln in 1865."

364
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:46,480
Jared. Check this out.

365
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:50,150
Doesn't that look like a map
of New Providence?

366
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:52,694
That's this island, right?
Yeah.

367
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:55,823
Silver powder horn.

368
00:35:56,532 --> 00:36:00,118
Silver horn and two silver guns.
What?

369
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:02,412
"Later they confirmed it was
the slave-pirate...

370
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:05,415
...by the silver horn and two
silver guns he was never without."

371
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:07,334
And this was his, right here.

372
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:08,877
Whose?
Tillman Thorp's.

373
00:36:09,086 --> 00:36:12,214
The runaway slave turned pirate.
He was crazy. He ran the Everglades.

374
00:36:12,464 --> 00:36:15,259
He and his crew were gnarly.
They ate alligators, drank lead...

375
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:18,887
...pissed musket balls, gave the
Confederates hell. lt was like revenge.

376
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:20,264
He just worked them.

377
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:26,395
So this is Snoop Dogg Silver.

378
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:28,730
These are the homies
over here, chilling.

379
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:30,732
Look at that guy drinking a 40.
Chilling?

380
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:32,234
Chilling. Yeah.

381
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:33,777
So, what do you think we got?

382
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:37,698
Some Confederate flags and old
Skynyrd tapes down there or what?

383
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:41,577
No, I don't think we found his ship.
I think we found the Zephyr.

384
00:36:41,743 --> 00:36:43,579
Yeah?
Yeah.

385
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:46,748
The Zephyr was a clipper ship
owned by this wealthy...

386
00:36:46,957 --> 00:36:50,586
...French trader, lived in New Orleans.
The war broke out, and he freaked out.

387
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:52,880
He takes his ship, family,
throws them onboard.

388
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:55,966
His antiques, valuables, gold, silver,
whatever he's got, onboard.

389
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:57,801
They try to make a beeline
for France.

390
00:36:57,968 --> 00:37:02,806
Okay, but Mr. Two Guns and a Horn
here screws up his itinerary, right?

391
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:06,059
The ship wasn't all he took. He also
took the Frenchman's daughter.

392
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:09,563
He kidnapped her?
No. She ran away with him.

393
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,940
Long after the ship was sunk...

394
00:37:12,149 --> 00:37:14,443
...they were spotted living together
in Eleuthera.

395
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,528
Oh, my God, this is a fairy tale.

396
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:18,447
They knew the French
would catch up...

397
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:21,950
...so they sunk the ship
to throw them off their trail.

398
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:25,621
Right. Gave up the gold for a girl.

399
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:28,457
Stop kissing.
First of all, it's disgusting.

400
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:33,253
Stop kissing. No self-respecting pirate
would do that, okay?

401
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,882
That's ridiculous.
Ten-to-one, this guy got so deep...

402
00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:40,802
...into that fine,
white, French "poo-needy"...

403
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:43,639
"Needy"?
"Needada," that he took his eyes...

404
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:46,475
...off the road and crashed,
splash, right into a rock.

405
00:37:46,642 --> 00:37:47,976
Guys.
That's what happened.

406
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:51,980
This is my new Romeo, right here.
It's reality.

407
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:53,690
I really don't care what happened.

408
00:37:53,857 --> 00:37:55,901
The bottom line is,
the Zephyr's down there.

409
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:57,611
And if we found it...

410
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:01,365
...we have hit the mother lode
of mother lodes.

411
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:05,244
What kind of mother lode are we
talking about here? For real. Reality.

412
00:38:07,538 --> 00:38:09,331
Tens of millions.

413
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:11,834
In 1861.

414
00:38:14,211 --> 00:38:17,381
Sounds like hundreds of millions.
More.

415
00:38:17,548 --> 00:38:19,091
That's insane.

416
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:21,009
Okay, this is the hook, though.

417
00:38:21,218 --> 00:38:23,178
If we want it to be ours,
clean and clear...

418
00:38:23,345 --> 00:38:25,556
...like, legal, no ifs, ands or buts...

419
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:29,268
...we have to come up with something
that says "the Zephyr" on it. Anything.

420
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:31,854
No, no.
What we need to do...

421
00:38:32,312 --> 00:38:35,858
...is figure out what thousands
of millions divided by four equals.

422
00:38:36,024 --> 00:38:37,985
That's what we need to figure out.

423
00:38:38,193 --> 00:38:41,029
God, it's so crazy.
I can't imagine.

424
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:54,418
Hey, Amanda,
you're gonna stay topside.

425
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:56,503
Why?

426
00:38:57,421 --> 00:39:00,215
Because you need to keep
an eye open for visitors.

427
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:02,634
Well, I still get my cut, right?
Of course, baby.

428
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:04,052
We're all equal partners.

429
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:10,017
All right. I'll stay up here
and I will work on my tan.

430
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:25,235
Tie on.

431
00:41:25,736 --> 00:41:27,696
Everything okay out here?

432
00:41:27,863 --> 00:41:29,865
Yeah. Yeah.
You sure?

433
00:41:30,073 --> 00:41:32,701
Yeah, you know, just trying
to even out my naughty bits.

434
00:41:34,953 --> 00:41:36,538
Can you cover yourself up, miss?

435
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:38,415
Sure.

436
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:55,849
Do you have any drugs
or weapons onboard?

437
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:58,310
No, I don't.
This is Bahamian water.

438
00:41:58,477 --> 00:42:00,062
We have the right
to search the boat.

439
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,257
Sir, I found something.

440
00:43:11,842 --> 00:43:13,635
Looks like prescription drugs to me.

441
00:43:16,972 --> 00:43:18,724
Are these yours?

442
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:21,185
No, they're not mine.

443
00:43:55,385 --> 00:43:56,553
What's your name, miss?

444
00:43:58,555 --> 00:43:59,556
Amanda.

445
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,309
Yo, is everything cool?

446
00:44:45,269 --> 00:44:47,354
Jared?
Hey.

447
00:44:48,105 --> 00:44:50,524
Yeah, everything is cool.
I didn't recognize the boat.

448
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:52,359
Yeah, it's a friend of mine's.

449
00:44:52,526 --> 00:44:55,737
Hey, Sam, how you doing?
Hey, Roy.

450
00:44:57,781 --> 00:44:58,991
Good.

451
00:44:59,158 --> 00:45:01,451
How's Allison and Emily?
They're good, good.

452
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:03,495
All right, guys, wrap it up.

453
00:45:03,662 --> 00:45:05,247
Roy, this is my friend, Bryce.

454
00:45:05,956 --> 00:45:08,041
Hey, Bryce.
How you doing?

455
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:11,420
That's Amanda up there.
We met. How you doing?

456
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:13,755
What happened
to your friend's arm?

457
00:45:13,922 --> 00:45:17,384
Oh, I just... Got a little too close
to the fire coral.

458
00:45:17,801 --> 00:45:19,720
Better wrap that up good.

459
00:45:20,137 --> 00:45:21,930
Why didn't you have
a "diver down" flag?

460
00:45:22,097 --> 00:45:24,892
Yeah, I know, I just...
I got lazy, man, you know.

461
00:45:25,058 --> 00:45:28,187
There's not a lot of boat traffic
out here, just a bunch of jellyfish.

462
00:45:28,353 --> 00:45:31,231
And drug traffickers.
Flying their planes in from Colombia...

463
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:33,942
...dropping loads in the water.
You know. Boat like this...

464
00:45:34,151 --> 00:45:36,945
We just saw a shark fin and,
I don't know, I couldn't resist.

465
00:45:37,112 --> 00:45:39,490
Wanted to show these mainlanders
a real shark.

466
00:45:39,656 --> 00:45:41,950
Yeah.
Didn't really think too much about it.

467
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:44,453
Right. Nice.
Yeah.

468
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,706
Came a little too close.
I almost pissed in my Speedo.

469
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:51,043
You crazy. If I saw a shark...

470
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,795
...I'd be like Jesus of Nazareth
and run across that water.

471
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:55,756
You hear what I'm saying?

472
00:45:55,923 --> 00:45:57,883
All right, brother. All right, girl.

473
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,843
Can't wait to see the girls.
All right.

474
00:46:01,053 --> 00:46:02,721
Take care of that arm.

475
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:05,057
I will.
See you, Roy.

476
00:46:05,224 --> 00:46:09,269
All right, guys, let's go.
Bye, guys. Have a good day.

477
00:46:09,686 --> 00:46:12,231
Bye. Bye, boys. Thanks.

478
00:46:30,332 --> 00:46:34,962
If everything pans out correctly,
we're gonna be doing a fifty-fifty split.

479
00:46:35,128 --> 00:46:37,130
That's half for me,
and half for you and Sam.

480
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:40,509
Well, what do you mean?
Don't say it. Do not say it.

481
00:46:40,676 --> 00:46:44,513
Amanda? Not family. You, I? Family.
Amanda, not family.

482
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:46,390
You'd cu...? You'd cut her out?
Yeah.

483
00:46:46,557 --> 00:46:49,268
Guaranteed, she's telling everyone.
She's gonna talk?

484
00:46:49,434 --> 00:46:51,186
Yeah.
No, if she talks, we'll...

485
00:46:51,353 --> 00:46:54,606
We'll have her in the Special Olympics
next year. She's not gonna talk.

486
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:56,316
Guys.

487
00:46:58,485 --> 00:46:59,987
Let's go. Now. Come on.

488
00:47:00,154 --> 00:47:02,656
What?
Protect my ass. Come on.

489
00:47:27,431 --> 00:47:32,102
Hey. I gotta go cool off.
What?

490
00:47:45,115 --> 00:47:46,992
Hey, Jared.
Hey, what's up, Danny?

491
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:49,578
Listen, some pointy-looking dreads
been asking for you.

492
00:47:49,786 --> 00:47:51,246
It was freaking me out a little.

493
00:47:51,413 --> 00:47:54,416
They was all up in my mouth, like,
you know, "Where you been diving?

494
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:57,461
Who you been hanging out with?"
What did you tell them?

495
00:47:57,628 --> 00:48:01,798
I didn't say shit. I don't know nothing.
I got your back, dog. Trust me on that.

496
00:48:02,674 --> 00:48:06,178
But they don't look like they
from around here, that's for sure.

497
00:48:08,263 --> 00:48:10,224
Yeah, well, I appreciate
the heads up. Thanks.

498
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:12,684
Everything cool?
Yeah.

499
00:48:12,851 --> 00:48:15,729
Yeah, everything's cool. Thanks,
though, Danny. I appreciate it.

500
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:18,816
Wet white guy coming through.

501
00:48:20,025 --> 00:48:22,569
Oh, here he comes. Here he comes.

502
00:48:23,821 --> 00:48:25,447
Where's Amanda?

503
00:48:25,656 --> 00:48:26,949
I don't know.

504
00:48:28,242 --> 00:48:29,701
No?

505
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,439
Hey, my man. My man.

506
00:48:59,857 --> 00:49:01,817
My man. Girl's with me.

507
00:49:01,984 --> 00:49:03,694
Just talking to the lady, my boy.

508
00:49:03,861 --> 00:49:06,280
I'm just telling you she's with me.
Baby, it's cool.

509
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:09,283
What's cool?
This is Primo. He owns this joint.

510
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:11,910
What's up, my man?
No, we're good, bro. We're good.

511
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:14,288
Great.
Come on.

512
00:49:14,454 --> 00:49:17,541
Hey, you wanna...?
You wanna do a little...? Little bump?

513
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:19,960
Yeah, yeah, let's do a bump.

514
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:23,172
That shit's for losers.
You know what I mean? Let's go.

515
00:49:23,881 --> 00:49:25,966
Ask her how she was
gonna pay for it.

516
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:29,511
How she was gonna pay for it?
Yeah. Ask how she was gonna pay.

517
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:31,513
Here, hold this.

518
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:34,266
Hey, hey.

519
00:49:38,854 --> 00:49:40,189
Oh, shit.

520
00:49:40,397 --> 00:49:42,316
Watch out. Watch out.
Get out of the way.

521
00:49:42,483 --> 00:49:43,692
Get out of the way!

522
00:49:49,781 --> 00:49:51,325
Hey.

523
00:49:52,075 --> 00:49:53,535
Hey, cut it out.

524
00:49:55,078 --> 00:49:56,538
Talk to your boy, Jared.
Primo...

525
00:49:56,747 --> 00:49:58,624
Talk to your boy.
Come on.

526
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:01,126
Chill out.
You're a bitch.

527
00:50:01,293 --> 00:50:02,920
Don't.
I'll murder you, boy.

528
00:50:07,925 --> 00:50:10,385
Jared, this just sucks.
What's your problem, Bryce?

529
00:50:10,552 --> 00:50:12,721
I ain't got a problem.
What's your problem?

530
00:50:12,888 --> 00:50:14,723
What are you looking at?

531
00:50:15,098 --> 00:50:16,892
He's not the guy to pick a fight with.

532
00:50:17,059 --> 00:50:19,353
I didn't pick a fight.
No, he didn't pick a fight.

533
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,438
I didn't do it.
He just punched the guy.

534
00:50:21,605 --> 00:50:23,690
Shut up. Shut up.
You're awesome. Real tough.

535
00:50:23,899 --> 00:50:26,860
You know what, you shut up.
And don't screw this up.

536
00:50:27,027 --> 00:50:29,738
Okay, I'm so... I'm sorry, okay?

537
00:50:29,947 --> 00:50:33,617
I'm sorry. I apologize.
All set, let's go, come on.

538
00:51:35,596 --> 00:51:36,805
Come on.

539
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:17,179
You all right? You all right?

540
00:52:17,387 --> 00:52:21,016
All right, let's go, let's go.
Get the heck out of here, man.

541
00:52:28,357 --> 00:52:31,235
Mother flip.
My jaw must be broken.

542
00:52:32,986 --> 00:52:35,197
What the hell was that all about?

543
00:52:38,033 --> 00:52:41,704
Okay, let's gather around here.
You wanna stay away from the ropes.

544
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:44,748
Now, you guys know what these are?
No.

545
00:52:44,915 --> 00:52:46,542
They're called "mailboxes."

546
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:52,715
Hit it.

547
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:54,091
Now, watch this.

548
00:52:54,925 --> 00:52:58,262
We use the mailboxes to deflect
the prop wash, right?

549
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:03,225
To blow away sand and debris
so we can find sunken ships.

550
00:53:03,392 --> 00:53:06,395
All right? Now... Hey.
Oh, my God, what is that?

551
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:08,564
What is that?
It's a pirate.

552
00:53:08,731 --> 00:53:10,232
It's a pirate.
It's a pirate.

553
00:53:10,399 --> 00:53:12,401
What does he have?
Treasure.

554
00:53:12,568 --> 00:53:14,403
Treasure.

555
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:15,946
There we go.

556
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:18,782
Yeah, enough chocolate
for everybody.

557
00:53:19,992 --> 00:53:22,703
Like I told you,
I'm not a treasure hunter, I'm a...?

558
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:26,165
Treasure finder.
Finder! Yeah.

559
00:53:26,331 --> 00:53:29,001
Bye, pirates.
Bye.

560
00:53:30,419 --> 00:53:33,756
Bye. Thank you.
Hey, absolutely. lt was a blast.

561
00:53:33,922 --> 00:53:36,633
I hope you guys come back.
Thank you.

562
00:53:37,217 --> 00:53:40,054
See you guys later.
Bye.

563
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:41,472
Have fun back at school.

564
00:53:42,848 --> 00:53:45,934
Hey, Jared. What's up, man?

565
00:53:46,101 --> 00:53:49,772
The Bonzel was that wreck
you found off Mysterioso Bank.

566
00:53:49,938 --> 00:53:51,648
What's going on, captain?
Don't know.

567
00:53:53,275 --> 00:53:56,820
Jared here found a hat. Seems pretty
excited about it, you know?

568
00:53:57,029 --> 00:54:00,657
I don't normally buy back
old souvenirs I sell, but, you know...

569
00:54:00,866 --> 00:54:03,077
...if you need the dough
and, you know...

570
00:54:03,243 --> 00:54:04,828
Just tell your boys to back off.

571
00:54:05,788 --> 00:54:07,498
My boys?

572
00:54:07,664 --> 00:54:11,126
You boys been bothering this man?
No, sir, captain.

573
00:54:11,293 --> 00:54:13,962
I got over 100 people that worked
for me on the Bonzel.

574
00:54:14,129 --> 00:54:16,382
I sold a shitload of hats...

575
00:54:16,548 --> 00:54:19,176
...so this could belong to anybody.

576
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:23,389
Just stay away from us, okay?

577
00:54:23,847 --> 00:54:27,351
Look, you're the one who boarded
my boat without permission.

578
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:30,729
You realize people still get shot
for that down here?

579
00:54:34,608 --> 00:54:36,860
Time and money, Jared.

580
00:54:37,027 --> 00:54:41,240
That's what it takes to bring stuff up
from the bottom of the sea. I got both.

581
00:54:41,699 --> 00:54:43,283
What do you got?

582
00:54:43,492 --> 00:54:46,537
Borrowed time and a borrowed dime?
That must suck.

583
00:54:49,623 --> 00:54:51,208
All right, you take care.

584
00:54:52,876 --> 00:54:54,545
Drive safe.

585
00:55:01,844 --> 00:55:05,013
Do you realize it's just a matter of time
until Bates finds that wreck.

586
00:55:05,222 --> 00:55:07,766
Meantime, we're crawling around
the bottom of the ocean...

587
00:55:07,933 --> 00:55:10,102
...digging for treasure
with spoons, man.

588
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:12,521
Yeah, and I know...

589
00:55:12,855 --> 00:55:16,316
...where to get the money
to get the stuff that we need...

590
00:55:16,525 --> 00:55:19,611
...only I can't go down
and get it by myself.

591
00:55:20,529 --> 00:55:22,865
No, we've already talked
about that.

592
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:25,325
But what are we talking about?

593
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:27,995
What are we talking about?
We're not talking about a lot.

594
00:55:28,203 --> 00:55:30,998
We're talking about just enough
to get what we need.

595
00:55:33,083 --> 00:55:37,171
Look at me right now in my face and
tell me you haven't thought about it.

596
00:55:37,963 --> 00:55:40,174
Well, you know l've thought about it.

597
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:43,302
But have you thought about
the penalties here for drug trafficking?

598
00:55:43,469 --> 00:55:45,929
I know what they are.
They throw you under the prison.

599
00:55:46,096 --> 00:55:47,639
Nope. Nope. Maximum...

600
00:55:47,806 --> 00:55:50,309
Maximum first-time offense
for trafficking, Jared?

601
00:55:50,476 --> 00:55:53,020
You know what it is? Five years.
Five years, Jared.

602
00:55:53,228 --> 00:55:55,939
It took me longer to get through
law school and pass the bar.

603
00:55:56,106 --> 00:55:57,357
Only five years, huh?
Yeah.

604
00:55:57,524 --> 00:56:00,110
Man, you wouldn't last five days
in Fox Hill Prison.

605
00:56:00,277 --> 00:56:02,237
You know what, man?
We're risking our lives.

606
00:56:02,404 --> 00:56:04,239
We're risking our lives
every single day...

607
00:56:04,448 --> 00:56:07,034
Iooking for a 150-year-old ship
that might be buried...

608
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:11,080
...under the bottom of the ocean,
while 100 million, easy...

609
00:56:11,288 --> 00:56:13,540
...easy, sits in a plane
200 yards away.

610
00:56:14,333 --> 00:56:16,585
We could get that money we need
to get that boat.

611
00:56:16,752 --> 00:56:20,047
And what do we do? Keep swimming
on by it like it doesn't even exist.

612
00:56:20,214 --> 00:56:21,924
Tell me what's crazy.

613
00:56:22,132 --> 00:56:24,218
Jesus Chri...
Jared, l've dealt with these people.

614
00:56:24,426 --> 00:56:25,928
I defended these people.

615
00:56:26,136 --> 00:56:28,097
These people who move
tons of this shit.

616
00:56:28,305 --> 00:56:32,142
They're not gifted people, Jared.
This is not rocket science.

617
00:56:32,684 --> 00:56:36,230
And I'm not a drug dealer.
No. You are not a drug dealer.

618
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:38,440
You're a 29-year-old dive bum.

619
00:56:39,483 --> 00:56:40,984
You are.

620
00:56:41,151 --> 00:56:44,321
I'm serious, man. What's so funny?
You live in a trailer.

621
00:56:44,738 --> 00:56:46,907
You got a boat on blocks.

622
00:56:47,074 --> 00:56:50,327
Okay? And you got 50 bucks
to your name on a good day.

623
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:52,955
I mean, come on. Well, Sam... Sam.

624
00:56:53,163 --> 00:56:56,542
How long you think a girl like Sam
will stick around if you don't fix that?

625
00:56:56,709 --> 00:56:58,711
Sam is not like that.
They're all like that.

626
00:56:58,877 --> 00:57:00,796
Sam isn't.
Okay.

627
00:57:00,963 --> 00:57:02,131
Look, I love you to death.

628
00:57:02,339 --> 00:57:04,800
The whole flip-flop-and-board-short
thing is cute now...

629
00:57:04,967 --> 00:57:07,803
...but what about when you're
the old man sitting at the bar...

630
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:09,930
...and nothing in your pocket
but sand...

631
00:57:10,139 --> 00:57:13,100
...and you're drooling and you're
going on and on about how you...

632
00:57:13,308 --> 00:57:15,352
You were the one
who found the Zephyr.

633
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,981
It was you until Bates came along...

634
00:57:19,148 --> 00:57:23,694
...and he stole that shit right from
under you. You gonna be that guy?

635
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:27,656
You know what, Jared? Winners.

636
00:57:27,823 --> 00:57:31,493
Winners make the rules,
and losers live by them.

637
00:57:32,828 --> 00:57:34,955
What are we talk...?
It's a one-time thing, man.

638
00:57:35,122 --> 00:57:39,501
It's a one-time thing.
Means to an end.

639
00:57:39,668 --> 00:57:41,378
That's all it is.

640
00:57:49,136 --> 00:57:50,888
Where are you going?

641
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:54,183
What, the conversation's
done now, Jared?

642
00:57:56,685 --> 00:57:58,312
Jared?

643
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:09,031
He didn't go for it.

644
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:14,661
You wanna keep tricking
or you wanna start pimping?

645
00:58:19,917 --> 00:58:21,627
I think it matters.

646
00:58:21,794 --> 00:58:23,545
What matters?

647
00:58:23,712 --> 00:58:25,172
The legend.

648
00:58:25,339 --> 00:58:27,841
About the pirate and the girl.

649
00:58:29,468 --> 00:58:32,554
I think it matters that he gave up
the treasure for love.

650
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:36,683
You do?
Sure.

651
00:58:36,892 --> 00:58:39,311
Don't let Bryce hear you say that.

652
00:58:40,437 --> 00:58:42,356
What about you?

653
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:46,026
Would you give up treasure
for love?

654
00:58:52,908 --> 00:58:54,576
Like it's even a question.

655
00:58:59,206 --> 00:59:02,543
I'd definitely take the treasure.
You're an ass. You would.

656
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:05,254
No way. No way.
Yes, you would.

657
00:59:05,671 --> 00:59:08,257
We have a good life. A great one.

658
00:59:09,133 --> 00:59:11,719
You should ask yourself
what's missing in your life...

659
00:59:11,927 --> 00:59:14,054
...that money will get you.

660
00:59:31,363 --> 00:59:33,240
All right, hit it.

661
00:59:48,922 --> 00:59:52,134
We good?
Hold on. Hold on. Now.

662
01:00:50,192 --> 01:00:51,735
Hey, guys.

663
01:00:52,069 --> 01:00:53,612
How's it going?

664
01:00:54,988 --> 01:00:58,283
Like shit.
What you gonna do about it?

665
01:00:58,701 --> 01:01:01,286
I have a feeling I'm gonna
make it all better, baby.

666
01:01:01,495 --> 01:01:05,457
Winning. Winning. What's that, bro?

667
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,043
What you gonna do?

668
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:10,421
What'd you do if I sock you
in your face, homeboy?

669
01:01:10,587 --> 01:01:12,589
What if I sock you...?
What if I sock you in...?

670
01:01:12,756 --> 01:01:15,050
What if I sock you
right in your head?

671
01:01:16,176 --> 01:01:19,304
Yeah. No, no.
We're good, right? It's all good?

672
01:01:19,513 --> 01:01:21,223
What's that?
You want the one-two-three?

673
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:23,726
One-two-three?
What are you gonna do, bro?

674
01:01:28,272 --> 01:01:30,691
Get out of the car, Opie.

675
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:36,280
What?

676
01:01:36,447 --> 01:01:39,033
I gotta go, man.
You gotta go?

677
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:41,994
I gotta go to work. My baby mama
harassing me for a new weave.

678
01:01:42,161 --> 01:01:43,328
All right, see you, Danny.

679
01:01:43,495 --> 01:01:45,748
I'll see you later, all right?
Yeah.

680
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:06,477
Yeah?
Hey. What's up, bro? It's me.

681
01:02:06,643 --> 01:02:07,853
Hey, what's going on?

682
01:02:08,062 --> 01:02:11,023
Can you meet me somewhere now?
Yeah, where at?

683
01:02:23,035 --> 01:02:24,078
Now, stop that.

684
01:02:30,084 --> 01:02:31,627
Hey, what's up?

685
01:02:48,477 --> 01:02:49,853
This him?

686
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:51,897
Yeah. He's a local. I know him.

687
01:02:53,399 --> 01:02:54,733
He's okay.

688
01:02:55,609 --> 01:02:58,070
What's going on?
You tell me.

689
01:03:04,743 --> 01:03:07,621
Here's the deal. Don't give me
that look. Everything's fine.

690
01:03:07,788 --> 01:03:10,165
It's fine. It's fine.
These guys... Everything's cool.

691
01:03:10,332 --> 01:03:12,251
They thought I was Babylon,
I'm clearly not.

692
01:03:12,418 --> 01:03:14,712
So everything's good now,
right, brothers? Right?

693
01:03:14,878 --> 01:03:16,630
Come on. Hey, come on.

694
01:03:17,256 --> 01:03:19,883
Mr. Nobody, from nowhere,
tried to crash my party...

695
01:03:20,092 --> 01:03:22,010
...without an invitation.

696
01:03:22,428 --> 01:03:25,764
I need someone to vouch for him
before we nail his coffin shut.

697
01:03:28,225 --> 01:03:29,601
You found my plane, didn't you?

698
01:03:29,768 --> 01:03:32,896
Okay, now, you see that?
Look, let... Do we have a deal or not?

699
01:03:33,063 --> 01:03:34,565
Because I mean, it's...

700
01:03:35,023 --> 01:03:36,525
No, we don't.

701
01:03:38,027 --> 01:03:41,071
So what's...? I mean, F you.
ls there a problem?

702
01:03:41,238 --> 01:03:42,573
Is there a problem?
Yeah.

703
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:47,244
You sound like you work in retail.
Yes, there is a problem.

704
01:03:56,211 --> 01:04:00,257
It takes balls, stealing my cocaine
and trying to sell it back to me.

705
01:04:00,466 --> 01:04:02,760
Your cocaine. Okay.
That's something we didn't know.

706
01:04:02,926 --> 01:04:04,845
Now, listen up. Listen up.
I swear on my...

707
01:04:05,554 --> 01:04:08,390
I don't care how my stuff
found its way back to me.

708
01:04:08,557 --> 01:04:11,351
I just want it back. All of it.

709
01:04:13,896 --> 01:04:17,775
That is all of it.
No, this stuff don't come in six-packs.

710
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:19,985
Well, that's all we found.

711
01:04:22,821 --> 01:04:24,448
That's all we found.

712
01:04:33,832 --> 01:04:35,417
There is 800 kilos in that plane...

713
01:04:35,584 --> 01:04:38,504
...and I want every brick of it
in 12 hours' time.

714
01:04:40,464 --> 01:04:43,842
Primo tells me the ocean
is your soccer field.

715
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:47,513
Me, I never leave this boat.

716
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:51,016
So this is how it's gonna be.

717
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:55,437
You are gonna swim back down
to the octopus's garden...

718
01:04:55,604 --> 01:04:59,650
...get the rest of it and bring it to me.
Then we'll talk numbers.

719
01:05:00,025 --> 01:05:03,654
There's a lot of boats buzzing around
out there, looking for my plane.

720
01:05:03,821 --> 01:05:07,491
If you get caught
and you give them my name...

721
01:05:08,367 --> 01:05:10,411
...I'm gonna come after those
you love most.

722
01:05:14,873 --> 01:05:16,417
Okay?

723
01:05:19,545 --> 01:05:20,879
No, it's not okay.

724
01:05:25,634 --> 01:05:27,094
Did you say something?

725
01:05:28,262 --> 01:05:30,931
We don't have the equipment
we need to haul the rest up...

726
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:32,725
...and it's gonna cost...

727
01:05:33,434 --> 01:05:36,812
...30,000, nonrefundable,
to get the rest of it.

728
01:05:41,567 --> 01:05:42,985
Give him the money.

729
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:55,581
You have 12 hours.

730
01:05:57,374 --> 01:05:59,293
Spend it wisely.

731
01:06:19,104 --> 01:06:21,732
That was intense.
Hey, hey.

732
01:06:21,899 --> 01:06:23,400
Hey. Okay.

733
01:06:23,609 --> 01:06:27,029
I can't believe you.
Okay. All right.

734
01:06:28,322 --> 01:06:30,449
You put everyone's life in jeopardy.

735
01:06:30,616 --> 01:06:32,451
What's wrong with you?

736
01:06:33,077 --> 01:06:35,788
I don't understand. I don't
understand what the problem is.

737
01:06:35,954 --> 01:06:38,332
We go down there,
we go down in that wreck...

738
01:06:38,499 --> 01:06:40,918
...we bring up some coke,
we deal with these morons...

739
01:06:41,085 --> 01:06:43,712
...and then in a month
we're on the Discovery Channel...

740
01:06:43,921 --> 01:06:46,465
...up to our knees in treasure,
smiling, like this.

741
01:06:46,632 --> 01:06:48,717
What's the problem?

742
01:06:53,222 --> 01:06:55,224
It better be that simple.

743
01:06:56,183 --> 01:06:58,811
And if anything happens to Sam,
I swear I'm gonna kill you.

744
01:07:03,232 --> 01:07:04,900
Come on.

745
01:07:08,862 --> 01:07:11,573
Sam, it's all good. This helps.
This is not a problem.

746
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:13,450
Jared hooked it up. It's all good.

747
01:07:13,617 --> 01:07:17,538
I told you she wouldn't be into it.
She's so clean, she squeaks.

748
01:07:17,705 --> 01:07:19,748
Shut up, you coke whore.
Sam.

749
01:07:19,957 --> 01:07:22,334
Very nice.
Amanda, stop. All right?

750
01:07:22,501 --> 01:07:26,213
We're all in this together now, right?
Not me. Not anymore.

751
01:07:26,797 --> 01:07:29,007
Bye.
Sam.

752
01:07:29,174 --> 01:07:30,801
Hey, Sam.

753
01:07:31,844 --> 01:07:33,804
Sam.
See you on the 10:00 news.

754
01:07:33,971 --> 01:07:35,848
What?
You heard me.

755
01:07:36,014 --> 01:07:38,851
Sam, come on, what are you doing?
What is wrong with you?

756
01:07:39,017 --> 01:07:41,812
A week ago you had too much integrity
to work for Scuba Bob...

757
01:07:41,979 --> 01:07:44,273
...and now you're working
for frigging drug dealers?

758
01:07:45,149 --> 01:07:46,608
Yeah, but...

759
01:07:47,151 --> 01:07:51,822
I believe in you more than
in the prospect of any treasure.

760
01:07:53,449 --> 01:07:57,828
If we do this just this one time...

761
01:07:58,287 --> 01:08:02,166
...we salvage the Zephyr
and it's over. That's it.

762
01:08:05,169 --> 01:08:07,379
It's already over.

763
01:08:10,382 --> 01:08:12,676
Oh, come on,
what are you talking about?

764
01:08:13,427 --> 01:08:15,220
Sam, come on.

765
01:08:24,813 --> 01:08:26,774
Sam, come on.

766
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:39,495
Yeah, you ready, Bryce?
All right, hit it, Jared.

767
01:08:53,342 --> 01:08:55,928
Turn it off. Turn it...

768
01:08:58,055 --> 01:08:59,390
Hey, Bryce, you okay?

769
01:08:59,556 --> 01:09:03,185
Let me get the sand out of my ass
and I'll tell you exactly how I am.

770
01:09:04,353 --> 01:09:06,021
You see anything?

771
01:09:06,563 --> 01:09:07,981
Bryce, you hear me?

772
01:09:08,148 --> 01:09:10,150
I see something.

773
01:09:10,526 --> 01:09:13,320
Keep it going, keep it going,
keep it going. Yes, yes, yes.

774
01:09:13,487 --> 01:09:15,030
Keep it going.

775
01:09:17,574 --> 01:09:19,410
Bingo, baby.

776
01:09:22,913 --> 01:09:25,249
Cut it, cut it, cut it.

777
01:09:25,416 --> 01:09:27,042
Bryce, how are we doing?

778
01:09:27,251 --> 01:09:28,961
Come down, come down.

779
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:40,222
Baby, here we come.

780
01:09:41,598 --> 01:09:43,559
Yes, yes.

781
01:09:43,726 --> 01:09:46,854
Oh, my God, look at this.

782
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:50,315
Let's go find the gold,
the G-old.

783
01:09:57,281 --> 01:09:59,616
Blow, baby, blow.

784
01:10:03,954 --> 01:10:05,289
All right, now suck.

785
01:10:23,474 --> 01:10:25,809
Hey, over here.
What? What is it?

786
01:10:25,976 --> 01:10:28,437
You got gold? What?

787
01:10:36,612 --> 01:10:37,863
Hell, no.

788
01:10:38,739 --> 01:10:41,992
What's that say? What's that say?
Read that shit, bitch.

789
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:44,661
Look at that. What's that say?

790
01:10:45,746 --> 01:10:50,042
Zephyr. Zephyr. Zephyr.

791
01:10:50,209 --> 01:10:52,544
That's what we need,
the name on something, right?

792
01:10:53,796 --> 01:10:56,465
That's it right there, baby,
that's the claim and the fame.

793
01:10:56,632 --> 01:10:58,425
Now let's go find the gold
and get paid.

794
01:10:58,717 --> 01:11:02,888
Where's the cheddar? The golden
cheddar? The old-gay eddar-chay?

795
01:11:05,641 --> 01:11:09,603
Jared, where are you going? We need
to find the cheddar cheese, the gold.

796
01:11:23,492 --> 01:11:25,577
Amanda, come here, come here.

797
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:28,956
Look at... Look at the P. Diddy juice.

798
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:32,251
1853. Good year.

799
01:11:32,418 --> 01:11:34,128
Keep it crispy. Pop the top.

800
01:11:35,838 --> 01:11:38,507
I can't take this mask off.

801
01:11:38,674 --> 01:11:42,010
Let's go upstairs. Come on.
Whatever.

802
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:46,014
Would you give up treasure
for love?

803
01:11:46,181 --> 01:11:48,642
Would you give up treasure
for love?

804
01:11:50,018 --> 01:11:52,354
I love you.

805
01:12:06,577 --> 01:12:08,245
Give me the bags.

806
01:12:10,706 --> 01:12:13,917
Hey. Hey, Chico, get the yeyo, man.

807
01:12:14,084 --> 01:12:17,129
I've never seen so much yeyo
in my life.

808
01:12:17,379 --> 01:12:19,923
Lots of cheese.
Look at all the cheese.

809
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:21,633
Come on, let's just get this done.

810
01:12:23,343 --> 01:12:26,305
Take it to the line.
It's heavier than I thought it would be.

811
01:12:37,066 --> 01:12:39,526
All right, I need another bag.

812
01:12:46,075 --> 01:12:50,120
Listen, I'm gonna bring up this load
and the bell. Keep filling the bags.

813
01:13:34,123 --> 01:13:35,708
Bryce, I need another one, come on.

814
01:13:39,962 --> 01:13:41,213
Here you go.

815
01:14:17,499 --> 01:14:20,669
Jesus Christ. Shit. Jared!

816
01:14:21,295 --> 01:14:22,921
Hey, Bryce, come back.

817
01:14:26,508 --> 01:14:29,344
Jared!
Oh, no.

818
01:14:32,806 --> 01:14:34,933
What? What's wrong?

819
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:39,355
Jared. Jared, you gotta...
Oh, no. Oh, no, what happened?

820
01:14:39,521 --> 01:14:41,190
Take off her BC.

821
01:14:44,109 --> 01:14:46,070
Help me out.
Get her on the boat.

822
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:54,953
Turn her over.

823
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,455
Oh, dear God.

824
01:14:56,622 --> 01:14:59,792
Oh, shit. We're getting
out of here, come on.

825
01:15:37,204 --> 01:15:39,206
Was she a certified diver?

826
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:42,793
You know, I don't know.

827
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,087
What about yourself?
Are you a certified diver?

828
01:15:45,254 --> 01:15:49,425
Look, ma'am... Ma'am, I'm a lawyer.

829
01:15:57,224 --> 01:15:58,517
I'm sorry.

830
01:15:59,059 --> 01:16:03,063
I'm just glad you're okay.
I love you.

831
01:16:07,192 --> 01:16:08,902
We gotta get back down there
and get that stuff.

832
01:16:09,069 --> 01:16:12,197
It's down there, just waiting for us.
Shut up, Bryce.

833
01:16:12,406 --> 01:16:14,867
Why don't you shut up, Sam.
Why don't you shut up, okay?

834
01:16:15,034 --> 01:16:16,785
You put us through all this.
Would you...?

835
01:16:16,952 --> 01:16:19,496
This wouldn't have happened
if it weren't for you. Get it?

836
01:16:19,663 --> 01:16:22,624
Yes, I got it. Great.
Now we're here, so let's go.

837
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:25,377
The quicker we go down there
and get them off our backs...

838
01:16:25,544 --> 01:16:27,212
...the quicker we can get
our treasure.

839
01:16:27,755 --> 01:16:30,966
Amanda's dead, and you're
still thinking about treasure.

840
01:16:31,425 --> 01:16:34,803
I've known her for five days.
Five days.

841
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:36,430
You are such an asshole.

842
01:16:36,597 --> 01:16:40,100
Why am I an asshole?
What do you want me to do, Sam?

843
01:16:40,267 --> 01:16:43,187
You want me to wear an armband?
Go into mourning? Plan a funeral?

844
01:16:43,353 --> 01:16:46,398
I'm a terrible person. That's what it is.
I'm a terrible person, Sam.

845
01:16:46,607 --> 01:16:48,150
Yeah.
You got it?

846
01:16:48,317 --> 01:16:49,985
Who is it?
You got the product?

847
01:16:50,152 --> 01:16:53,280
Wait, who is it?
Man, we ran into some complications.

848
01:16:53,447 --> 01:16:55,574
You got it or not?
No.

849
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:58,827
Then we have a problem,
Scuba-Doo.

850
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:00,704
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

851
01:17:01,955 --> 01:17:03,665
He's got a gun.
Go, go, go.

852
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:07,961
Go, Jared. Watch those kids.

853
01:17:09,129 --> 01:17:10,756
Make a right, make a right.

854
01:17:15,719 --> 01:17:17,513
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

855
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:21,225
Come on, Jared. Jared.
I'm going for it.

856
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:25,604
Jared.
Oh, shit.

857
01:17:26,021 --> 01:17:27,064
Shit.

858
01:17:32,486 --> 01:17:35,698
You okay?
Jared? Jared?

859
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:37,950
Jared, he's coming.
Jared?

860
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:40,911
Hey, I'm sorry.
Jared, here he comes. Get in the car.

861
01:17:41,578 --> 01:17:43,580
What are you doing?
I'm gonna take him out.

862
01:17:43,747 --> 01:17:46,792
Jared?
Yo, he's gonna hit the car. Back up.

863
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,461
Back up, man.
I'm going, I'm going.

864
01:17:51,004 --> 01:17:53,173
You'll hit my car. What you doing?
Jesus' sake.

865
01:17:55,008 --> 01:17:56,593
I got it, I got it.

866
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,014
Get him. The man move.

867
01:18:03,851 --> 01:18:05,269
Oh, man.

868
01:18:09,356 --> 01:18:11,900
What are you doing?
Go to Shoreline Cove. I'll meet you.

869
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:13,360
Jared...
Sam, you drive.

870
01:18:13,569 --> 01:18:17,031
No. Jar... It's not safe.
Bro, don't be a hero. Be a coward.

871
01:18:17,156 --> 01:18:19,742
Be a coward, get in the car.
Drive. I need you to drive.

872
01:18:19,908 --> 01:18:21,910
Sam, get in the car.
What are you gonna do?

873
01:18:22,077 --> 01:18:27,207
I'll meet up with you. Bryce, you drive.
I'll see you there. I'll be okay. Drive.

874
01:18:27,374 --> 01:18:31,211
No. No... Fuck.

875
01:18:37,301 --> 01:18:41,138
This boy a madman.
Him a madman here.

876
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:46,268
Sam, where is this place?
Right up here.

877
01:18:46,935 --> 01:18:48,395
All right, slow down.

878
01:18:51,607 --> 01:18:52,816
Where you going?

879
01:18:52,983 --> 01:18:55,027
This is what we should've done
a long time ago.

880
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:03,327
Hey.
Oh, what are you doing?

881
01:19:04,745 --> 01:19:07,122
What's going on? Where you been?
Where's Jared?

882
01:19:08,999 --> 01:19:11,543
Can we talk for a minute?
What's going on?

883
01:19:14,296 --> 01:19:18,008
Stupid. So stupid.

884
01:19:18,175 --> 01:19:20,928
Go. Just go. Just go.

885
01:19:21,887 --> 01:19:23,597
Sorry, Sam.

886
01:19:49,081 --> 01:19:51,333
Here you go.
What this?

887
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:54,545
This is from a sunken ship
full of treasure.

888
01:19:54,712 --> 01:19:58,048
Easily worth 10 times more
than your boss's coke.

889
01:19:58,215 --> 01:20:02,970
And you guys can have all of it,
if you forget you ever met us.

890
01:20:05,139 --> 01:20:07,015
Let's see if we can make a deal.

891
01:20:11,603 --> 01:20:13,022
This is serious, Sam.

892
01:20:14,023 --> 01:20:16,734
If I go to the wrong person
with this, right?

893
01:20:17,526 --> 01:20:20,654
I got the chief of police in my
back yard right now. We're coworkers.

894
01:20:20,821 --> 01:20:22,865
And I don't even know
if I can trust them.

895
01:20:23,032 --> 01:20:28,912
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to drag you into this.

896
01:20:29,079 --> 01:20:33,417
I just... I... I didn't know
who else to go to.

897
01:20:34,793 --> 01:20:36,587
Let me make a call.

898
01:20:37,463 --> 01:20:40,215
I might know somebody
who may be able to help.

899
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:42,760
Okay?

900
01:21:07,242 --> 01:21:08,827
Get down.

901
01:21:09,495 --> 01:21:11,121
Memo.

902
01:23:02,816 --> 01:23:05,194
Well, I see you've met
my business partner.

903
01:23:08,322 --> 01:23:11,116
You have something
that belongs to me, Jared?

904
01:23:33,389 --> 01:23:34,681
No, don't shoot.

905
01:23:40,562 --> 01:23:43,399
There he is. Use the solid.
Go get him.

906
01:24:45,794 --> 01:24:48,797
Man, this boy, he gotta be
around here somewhere.

907
01:24:56,180 --> 01:24:57,389
See him over there, mate?

908
01:25:27,544 --> 01:25:28,796
What it is, man.

909
01:25:36,929 --> 01:25:39,348
No sign of him yet, boss.
Brother's got skills.

910
01:25:39,515 --> 01:25:41,767
Forget about him.
Get back to the boat.

911
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,275
Everything's gonna be all right.
What about Jared?

912
01:25:50,442 --> 01:25:56,240
Oh, Jared, he'll be okay.
Trust me, Reyes is done. Over.

913
01:25:56,407 --> 01:25:58,492
He won't be a problem anymore
for anyone.

914
01:25:58,659 --> 01:26:00,369
Thank you, Roy.

915
01:26:00,577 --> 01:26:03,330
You don't have to thank me, Sam.
This is the guy right here.

916
01:26:07,209 --> 01:26:08,919
Bates?

917
01:26:24,893 --> 01:26:26,562
Hey, Bryce.

918
01:26:27,938 --> 01:26:30,065
Where's Sam?
What the hell happened to you?

919
01:26:30,232 --> 01:26:33,402
The hell with that. Where's Sam at?
She went to... To the cops, bro.

920
01:26:33,569 --> 01:26:36,989
She went to Roy. I couldn't stop her.
She just jumped right out of the car.

921
01:26:37,156 --> 01:26:39,366
Give me your phone.
Why? What's up?

922
01:26:39,575 --> 01:26:41,660
I'm gonna call Sam.
What's going on?

923
01:26:41,827 --> 01:26:43,537
Reyes and Primo are dead.

924
01:26:43,704 --> 01:26:45,330
Bates killed them.

925
01:26:45,497 --> 01:26:47,499
What do you mean,
Bates killed them?

926
01:26:47,666 --> 01:26:49,168
Reyes and Bates were partners.

927
01:26:49,334 --> 01:26:52,755
We found their lost coke, and Reyes
tried to cut Bates out of the deal.

928
01:26:53,505 --> 01:26:56,175
So Bates doesn't look
for treasure, really.

929
01:26:56,341 --> 01:26:59,636
No, he's been looking for his plane,
been moving drugs this whole time.

930
01:27:05,726 --> 01:27:08,312
Hello.
Hey, who's this?

931
01:27:08,479 --> 01:27:11,398
Jared. Hi. Listen,
I just wanted to say...

932
01:27:11,565 --> 01:27:14,443
...that I am really, really sorry
about all this.

933
01:27:14,610 --> 01:27:17,154
Your girlfriend says she doesn't
know where my plane is.

934
01:27:17,321 --> 01:27:19,573
Either she's a good liar
or she likes pain.

935
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:22,409
Not sure. You know her better
than I do. What do you think?

936
01:27:22,785 --> 01:27:24,828
Hey, Derek, why don't you
just let her go.

937
01:27:25,621 --> 01:27:28,415
Well, you tell me where my plane is
and she walks.

938
01:27:29,458 --> 01:27:31,335
Let me talk to her for a minute.
I would.

939
01:27:31,502 --> 01:27:36,840
I would let you talk to her right now,
but she's got this thing in her mouth.

940
01:27:39,093 --> 01:27:41,220
Look, you want me to show you
where your coke is?

941
01:27:41,387 --> 01:27:45,599
No, no, no. Not show, Jared. Tell.

942
01:27:45,849 --> 01:27:49,186
You give me the coordinates right now
and Sam walks off this boat.

943
01:27:49,353 --> 01:27:51,230
No, I'm gonna tell you
how it's gonna go.

944
01:27:51,397 --> 01:27:52,815
This isn't a partnership, Jared.

945
01:27:52,981 --> 01:27:55,275
No, that's exactly what this is.
Fifty-fifty.

946
01:27:55,442 --> 01:27:59,947
If you want your coke, meet me
three klicks due south of Easter Point.

947
01:28:00,155 --> 01:28:03,409
All right. I will see you there.

948
01:28:03,575 --> 01:28:04,785
Oh, and Jared...

949
01:28:05,327 --> 01:28:08,872
...you saw what happened to the
last partner who tried to screw me.

950
01:28:17,005 --> 01:28:19,800
Remember when I said if anything
happened to Sam, I'd kill you?

951
01:28:19,967 --> 01:28:22,469
Oh, don't do that.
Don't hit me with the fucking chair.

952
01:28:31,729 --> 01:28:34,690
You told me this would be easy.
This would be a one-time thing.

953
01:28:34,857 --> 01:28:38,610
Yeah. Okay, it didn't go the way
I planned it. All right? lt went wrong.

954
01:28:38,777 --> 01:28:40,279
Yeah, this was all wrong.

955
01:28:43,157 --> 01:28:46,326
If I didn't have such a sweet tooth...

956
01:28:50,247 --> 01:28:54,376
...I would kill you. Right now.

957
01:28:54,543 --> 01:28:56,211
Bates.

958
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:00,007
Yes, Roy?

959
01:29:04,178 --> 01:29:07,056
What?
You got what you wanted, right?

960
01:29:10,059 --> 01:29:11,268
She's had enough.

961
01:29:12,061 --> 01:29:13,687
I see.

962
01:29:14,563 --> 01:29:17,649
You're the one
who was right on top of it...

963
01:29:17,816 --> 01:29:19,902
...when you stopped them
the other day, right?

964
01:29:20,069 --> 01:29:22,196
And you're the one
that didn't log the location.

965
01:29:22,404 --> 01:29:26,658
Was that you?
I told you it didn't merit the attention.

966
01:29:26,825 --> 01:29:28,744
I believe them.

967
01:29:28,994 --> 01:29:30,662
They're friends of mine.

968
01:29:38,587 --> 01:29:41,673
They are friends of mine too.

969
01:29:47,596 --> 01:29:49,682
I'm not the one who put the gun
to your head.

970
01:29:49,848 --> 01:29:53,394
Did I make you settle with those guys
for that extra cash? Did I do that?

971
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:56,605
Oh, no, you did. You were there,
Jared, too, just like me.

972
01:29:56,772 --> 01:30:00,609
Your eyes were spinning.
Gold bars. Same as mine. No?

973
01:30:04,697 --> 01:30:06,740
I'm sorry, Jared.

974
01:30:08,242 --> 01:30:10,202
I screwed up.

975
01:30:12,454 --> 01:30:14,581
Man, I screwed up.

976
01:30:15,666 --> 01:30:17,626
I was the one that screwed up.

977
01:30:22,339 --> 01:30:24,758
Bates know I'm still here?

978
01:30:38,772 --> 01:30:40,024
Hey, Danny, we need a favor.

979
01:30:40,190 --> 01:30:43,235
Jared? Bryce?
What are y'all doing here?

980
01:30:43,402 --> 01:30:45,738
Come on, help me tie on.
Oh, yeah, man, no problem.

981
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:54,747
There he comes.

982
01:31:07,509 --> 01:31:09,344
Sam!

983
01:31:10,596 --> 01:31:13,265
All right. She's job security.

984
01:31:13,599 --> 01:31:16,435
Now, if you want her to live,
you take me to my plane...

985
01:31:16,643 --> 01:31:19,521
...you dive with us.
lt'll be like old times.

986
01:31:19,688 --> 01:31:21,774
Let her go and I'll sweeten the deal.

987
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:27,112
Sweet...? With what? That shipwreck
in your back yard? What, your dog?

988
01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:29,156
You have nothing to give me, Jared.

989
01:31:29,323 --> 01:31:31,283
I found the Zephyr.
What?

990
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:33,452
And I'll let you have the claim.

991
01:31:33,619 --> 01:31:36,205
I brought you here to save her life,
not to get her killed.

992
01:31:36,372 --> 01:31:38,624
Hundreds of millions...
The Zephyr doesn't exist.

993
01:31:38,832 --> 01:31:41,710
...it's all yours, if you want.
If you let Sam go. lt does exist.

994
01:31:41,877 --> 01:31:43,462
It's not a myth.
It's not a myth?

995
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:45,464
You want it? Then let her go.
Okay.

996
01:31:45,631 --> 01:31:48,300
Then let her go right now.
Sam, let's go. We're out of here.

997
01:31:48,467 --> 01:31:49,760
Go.
Let her go.

998
01:31:49,927 --> 01:31:52,471
Sam, he gave up the gold
and they got away.

999
01:31:54,932 --> 01:31:56,684
He found the Zephyr.

1000
01:31:57,393 --> 01:32:01,146
Maybe we'll meet up
in Never-Never Land...

1001
01:32:01,313 --> 01:32:04,483
...because I heard the tooth fairy
was gonna be there.

1002
01:32:05,359 --> 01:32:09,279
Santa Claus is coming, you know,
with my coke.

1003
01:32:26,547 --> 01:32:28,632
So how long you been
a drug trafficker?

1004
01:32:28,882 --> 01:32:31,593
I'm a salvor, Jared,
the same as l've always been.

1005
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:33,887
But investors don't like it
when you come back...

1006
01:32:34,054 --> 01:32:36,807
...to shore with nothing
but empty fuel tanks and a sunburn.

1007
01:32:37,516 --> 01:32:40,019
All right, is this it?
Throttle down.

1008
01:32:40,769 --> 01:32:42,521
Throttle down.

1009
01:32:43,230 --> 01:32:46,859
Why did you have to put me
in this situation, Jared?

1010
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:51,071
I mean, what am I supposed to do
with you and Sam now?

1011
01:32:51,238 --> 01:32:53,115
Pay us a finder's fee.

1012
01:32:53,282 --> 01:32:56,368
Yeah, see, now you sound like
a man who has a future.

1013
01:32:57,703 --> 01:33:00,873
The way I see it, Bates, you're the one
whose days are numbered.

1014
01:33:01,582 --> 01:33:04,793
You got this big ship and crew,
all this fancy gear...

1015
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:07,588
...and you couldn't even find
your own plane.

1016
01:33:07,963 --> 01:33:09,006
That must suck.

1017
01:33:32,196 --> 01:33:34,740
Hey, captain,
there's something up ahead.

1018
01:33:35,449 --> 01:33:37,993
Do you see it?
Right up there, 2 o'clock.

1019
01:33:39,119 --> 01:33:41,080
Raolo, slow down, man.

1020
01:33:46,418 --> 01:33:48,170
Right here, captain.

1021
01:33:50,255 --> 01:33:52,549
Now who's the treasure finder?

1022
01:33:53,092 --> 01:33:56,136
What the hell is this, Jared?
That's half your coke, captain.

1023
01:33:56,261 --> 01:33:58,430
Now I'm gonna go down
and destroy the rest of it.

1024
01:34:09,024 --> 01:34:10,401
Suit up!

1025
01:35:42,701 --> 01:35:45,287
Hey, crane's out. I'm going below.

1026
01:35:58,884 --> 01:36:00,094
Shit.

1027
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,806
No. No, no, no.

1028
01:36:04,932 --> 01:36:05,933
No.

1029
01:36:26,912 --> 01:36:29,665
Oh, Lordy, Lordy. Hey, hey.
Oh, today's your lucky day.

1030
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:34,128
Hey, boss, just the man I want to see.
You see how big this baby is?

1031
01:36:34,294 --> 01:36:36,338
What you saying?
We got divers in the water.

1032
01:36:36,505 --> 01:36:38,799
What divers, man?
I is the only diver out here.

1033
01:37:27,598 --> 01:37:29,975
Come on, you and the wife
can grill this up tonight.

1034
01:37:30,142 --> 01:37:32,102
I say leave. Now.

1035
01:37:47,701 --> 01:37:49,703
Do you copy?

1036
01:38:47,177 --> 01:38:50,848
Patrol. Message for
patrol boat five. Over.

1037
01:38:51,015 --> 01:38:53,058
This is patrol boat five. Control...

1038
01:39:31,055 --> 01:39:32,931
Come here. Come here.

1039
01:39:44,234 --> 01:39:46,362
Mayday! Mayday!
This is Sea Robin.

1040
01:39:46,570 --> 01:39:48,364
Twenty-five...

1041
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:03,754
Sea Robin, do you copy?

1042
01:40:05,381 --> 01:40:06,548
Sea Robin, do you copy?

1043
01:40:29,822 --> 01:40:32,574
Sea Robin,
please repeat your position.

1044
01:40:33,826 --> 01:40:35,994
Sea Robin, do you copy?

1045
01:40:37,162 --> 01:40:39,623
Sea Robin,
please repeat your position.

1046
01:42:53,006 --> 01:42:54,883
Jared!

1047
01:43:45,934 --> 01:43:47,770
Hey, Boone.

1048
01:43:47,936 --> 01:43:50,397
All right, we're good to go.
ls it all bueno?

1049
01:43:50,564 --> 01:43:51,899
Go ahead, bring it up.

1050
01:44:01,367 --> 01:44:03,202
Here it comes.

1051
01:44:05,162 --> 01:44:06,914
A little bit more.

1052
01:44:08,290 --> 01:44:10,918
Up, up. All right, there we go.

1053
01:44:13,253 --> 01:44:15,756
Jared?
That's all right. Keep going.

1054
01:44:18,676 --> 01:44:20,302
A little more, Bryce.

1055
01:44:26,725 --> 01:44:28,435
Why?

1056
01:44:41,323 --> 01:44:44,952
Oh, well. Let's come back tomorrow.
What do you mean?

1057
01:44:48,831 --> 01:44:51,208
I got everything I need right here.

1058
01:45:16,275 --> 01:45:19,194
Bryce?
What the hell?

1059
01:45:19,486 --> 01:45:22,072
What's he doing?
What a jagoff.

1060
01:45:26,285 --> 01:45:28,037
Hey!

1061
01:45:28,203 --> 01:45:31,165
I got the cheese.
What?

1062
01:45:31,331 --> 01:45:33,667
I have the dough.
What?

1063
01:45:33,876 --> 01:45:35,669
I have gold.
You found the gold?

1064
01:45:41,175 --> 01:45:41,967
Yeah!
