{1902}{1945}I'll ask George to fix your hair

{7561}{7593}She's gorgeous.
{7670}{7714}That's too much hair.
{7717}{7792}I asked you to fix it|like Zbeida Tarwath.
{7795}{7892}Patience, madam.|Your sister is so impatient.
{7898}{7942}I hope Tallel|and his family like it.
{7945}{8079}Everyone will love it. You'll be|the prettiest bride in Damascus.

{9336}{9382}He'll sleep through the wedding.
{9547}{9575}Is this appropriate?
{9599}{9627}No.
{9647}{9685}Wear something more conservative.
{9728}{9788}Fine.

{10200}{10226}Thank you.
{10417}{10492}{Y:i}Name: Marwan Salman|Nationality: Undefined

{10623}{10682}- What did you do in Italy?|- Italian girls are pretty

{10964}{11001}- Where did you stay there?|- Hold on.
{11045}{11203}Hi, I just landed.|I'll see you after my sister's wedding.
{11206}{11238}Where did you stay?
{11241}{11311}They interrogated me|enough when I left Israel.
{11314}{11349}- Wait there.|- Why?
{11352}{11400}Just wait there.
{11470}{11509}Today's a big day for the Druze
{11512}{11613}of the Golan. The pro-Syrian Druze|might provoke the demonstrators
{11616}{11718}supporting the new President and|cause a riot which could turn violent.
{11738}{11780}Therefore we must be careful today.
{11800}{11830}Questions?
{11878}{12012}OK, let me remind you there's a|wedding at the border today at 3pm.
{12017}{12105}No problem, except the bride|is the daughter of Hammed Salman
{12119}{12199}who's pro-Syrian, out on parole,
{12218}{12285}And there's a warrant against|him going to the border. Clear?
{12519}{12556}Hammed!
{12556}{12638}When is Marwan arriving?|I need someone to help me.
{12649}{12717}He'll be here soon,|his plane landed at six.
{12726}{12799}But you can't rely on|Marwan with these things.
{12808}{12869}And when is Hattem |supposed to arrive?
{12977}{13058}If Amal and my daughters|were back, they'd help.
{13061}{13139}Who'll help me?|Everyone will be at the demonstration.
{13142}{13177}No one'll help me!
{13207}{13312}Amin, stop complaining!|Go and slaughter some more sheep.
{13328}{13360}Ready?
{13360}{13421}Yes.
{13423}{13468}One, two, three!
{13530}{13566}Smile, everybody.
{13584}{13612}Together!
{13726}{13746}Mona,
{13746}{13782}what's wrong?|Did something happen?
{13797}{13849}Isn't she a beautiful bride?
{13868}{13891}Yes.
{13891}{13928}We'll never see her again.
{13947}{14017}What do you mean?|She'll come visit, won't she?
{14039}{14114}Why won't you see her again?|I don't get it.
{14209}{14242}I'll miss you.
{14282}{14359}Film me, I want to say something.
{14419}{14512}Tallel, when you see this,
{14539}{14589}Mona will already be your wife.
{14655}{14709}It's the last time I see her.
{14756}{14810}We're giving you our treasure.
{14847}{14911}Protect her like the apple of your eye.
{14925}{14963}Watch over her.
{15466}{15501}Congratulations to the bride.
{15549}{15594}Best wishes, Mona.
{16304}{16339}The village elders are here.
{16396}{16457}Go inside.
{16636}{16663}Hello.
{16663}{16694}Hello.
{16697}{16730}Go to your room.
{16790}{16820}Go upstairs...
{17042}{17075}Listen, Hammed...
{17111}{17168}You know how much we respect you.
{17179}{17263}We've heard your son|Hattem's coming to the wedding.
{17280}{17384}As far as we're concerned, he's outcast|since he married the Russian.
{17393}{17422}If he shows up,
{17428}{17475}you won't see us here.
{17523}{17558}Dear friends,
{17614}{17685}Hattem hasn't been here|for more than 8 years.
{17719}{17764}Today is his sister's wedding.
{17787}{17869}You know that this will|be his last chance to see her.
{17883}{17992}Listen, Hammed, you know|how much we appreciate you.
{18010}{18060}If it were anyone else,
{18075}{18154}we wouldn't have troubled ourselves|to come.
{18181}{18229}We'll never forget
{18238}{18281}what you did for our village
{18297}{18349}nor your years in jail.
{18360}{18404}But this is different!
{18413}{18444}If you prefer him...
{18464}{18507}and go against our religion,
{18535}{18577}you will lose our support
{18582}{18638}and we will cast you out, too.
{19507}{19554}Long time since you've been here?
{19601}{19660}Yes, almost 8 years.
{19663}{19697}Seriously? 8 years?
{19700}{19783}You'll behave yourself|at Grandfather's house, promise?
{19862}{19891}Hattem?
{19891}{19945}Let's go over the Arabic|you taught me.
{19966}{20011}How do you say|"Congratulations"?
{20066}{20092}Hallo?
{20170}{20206}Congrations...
{20221}{20264}How you are?
{20278}{20378}You can speak English.|My sisters understand English.
{20391}{20492}Why? Don't I speak well?|I won't speak at all then.
{20522}{20564}Try to get some sleep.
{20589}{20626}You worry too much.
{20671}{20717}You'll improve with time.
{20814}{20875}Relax, your parents will love him.
{21044}{21156}{Y:i}Huge crowds this morning|at the central square of Damascus
{21159}{21278}{Y:i}to pay their respect to the|late President and welcome his son:
{21962}{21996}That's the way it is.
{22142}{22175}Bless you.
{22197}{22230}May God please you.
{22233}{22264}Greetings!
{22279}{22312}Congratulations!
{22569}{22672}{Y:i}Our beloved president Bashar el-Assad
{22675}{22737}{Y:i}will deliver his speech|from the Parliament:
{22745}{22839}{Y:i}The Israeli withdrawal|in the 80s and 90s
{22842}{22904}{Y:i}and the retreat from Lebanon|this past May
{22907}{23011}{Y:i}proved the importance|of our solidarity:::
{23044}{23092}He looks even tougher|than his father.
{23113}{23164}{Y:i}People of Majdal!
{23167}{23214}{Y:i}Come to the village square!
{23217}{23298}{Y:i}Join the demonstration|for our new President:

{23501}{23551}Don't be late, Hammed.
{23652}{23685}Dad!
{23728}{23774}Are you going to the demonstration?
{23812}{23844}I won't be late.
{23858}{23904}Please don't go.
{23908}{23980}Your parole terms|forbid you to do that.
{23997}{24047}Please don't go.|For Mona's sake.
{24071}{24120}Why don't you let this day|go on peacefully?
{24137}{24189}We don't want|to visit you in jail again.
{24213}{24255}I have to go.
{24261}{24336}What will people think?|That Hammed is a coward?
{24340}{24419}You haven't slept well|since you came out of jail.
{24465}{24517}You're haunted by nightmares.
{24635}{24682}Don't worry about me, Amal.
{24732}{24776}They can't hurt me.
{24879}{24978}Join us, the Syrians|are close to our hearts!
{25292}{25395}Join us, the Syrians|have sacrificed their blood!
{25704}{25805}Unity, national unity.|The Golan belongs to Syria.
{25889}{25968}With spirit, with blood,|we'll redeem Bashar!
{25977}{26034}With spirit, with blood,|we'll redeem Bashar!
{26037}{26089}Hammed... Hammed!
{26092}{26129}Come here! Come!
{26170}{26225}Aren't you on parole?|What are you doing here?
{26246}{26277}Go home.
{26282}{26335}- I'm not leaving.|- Don't provoke me. You know
{26338}{26408}what happens to those who|provoke me!
{26411}{26479}Remember or|should I remind you, 5002?
{26488}{26534}You still remember my number.
{26542}{26655}Even I forgot it. I'm not afraid of you.|I was never afraid of you.
{26660}{26774}A country of criminals! For 33 years|you are occupying us without shame.
{26812}{26889}Hammed, go home.|Your daughter is getting married today.
{26947}{27032}With spirit, with blood,|we'll redeem the Golan!
{27250}{27282}I'll miss you.
{27485}{27529}I'll be lonely there.
{27606}{27636}I'm afraid.
{27654}{27687}Don't be afraid.
{27724}{27789}Tallel will love you|and you'll love him.
{27818}{27881}It won't be|like your previous marriage.
{27903}{27945}It's different this time.
{27979}{28021}What makes you so sure?
{28067}{28184}Life with him could turn out|to be a lot worse than my life now.
{28216}{28289}Perhaps I'm going from one jail|to another one.
{28295}{28325}Stop it.
{28335}{28439}You'll have a much better life there.
{28630}{28686}And what if we don't get along?
{28708}{28796}I won't be able to come back here.
{28840}{28891}Stop being so pessimistic!
{28927}{28967}Stop it!
{29268}{29364}I'm marrying someone|I only know from television.
{29493}{29560}At least you knew Amin|before you married him.
{29564}{29595}Knew him?
{29616}{29696}I saw him once|when he came to fix our roof!
{29746}{29800}A week later we were engaged...
{29811}{29856}A month later married...
{29887}{29931}And then I was pregnant.
{30115}{30149}You're not happy.
{30182}{30242}You were never happy with Amin.
{30255}{30305}How can I leave you here?
{31028}{31072}Wow, what a mess.
{31104}{31170}Do me a favor,|take your suitcases and get out.
{31178}{31269}What? My house|is on the other side of the village!
{31273}{31336}I don't want these Arabs|to throw stones at my cab.
{31339}{31379}Mom, who are those people?
{31421}{31463}Come on, get out already!
{31568}{31603}We have to get out.
{32172}{32243}Hold it, hold it...|Did you get me the whiskey?
{32254}{32353}I swear I was delayed at the airport.|They gave me hell.
{32421}{32457}Why don't you believe me?
{32504}{32573}Calm down, relax. Don't get upset.
{32576}{32680}I promise I'll meet you|with the money in 2 hours, OK?
{32713}{32770}Bye. Asshole.
{33395}{33425}Hattem!
{33446}{33480}Marwan?
{33485}{33517}It's my brother!
{33537}{33569}Marwan!
{33583}{33619}Come on, get in!
{33821}{33847}Amal!
{33899}{33959}Mother!
{33959}{33985}Marwan?
{34021}{34057}Welcome home, son.
{34082}{34113}I have a surprise.
{34131}{34160}Amal?
{34725}{34755}Hattem!
{34815}{34920}Darling! Darling!
{35527}{35581}Meet Evelina, my wife.
{35593}{35628}Congrations.
{35649}{35730}And this is our son Hammed.
{35849}{35933}God bless you, son.
{36110}{36139}Hattem!
{36415}{36463}- You look stunning!|- My turn now!
{36624}{36695}Majdal hasn't seen|such a demonstration for years!
{36711}{36759}Bashar's speech was very good.
{36773}{36816}He's Assad (lion) son of Assad.
{36890}{36934}- Welcome home, son.|- Father...
{37323}{37369}God bless you, Father.
{37402}{37436}How are you?
{37697}{37744}Don't you want to welcome your son?
{37880}{37910}Come in.
{38936}{38976}It's been 8 years,
{38995}{39054}and he still won't talk to me.
{39100}{39159}I thought he would soften up|over the years.
{39183}{39251}Maybe you were right.|We shouldn't have come here.
{39282}{39329}How long can one hide?
{39354}{39384}Enough!
{39420}{39507}I'll try to convince Dad.|He'll agree in the end.
{39523}{39625}Mom agrees, Dad is the problem.|You have to be patient.
{39634}{39711}I have no problem waiting,|but are you sure you'll convince him?
{39895}{39956}Who was it? He must have seen us!
{39967}{40100}Byan, clean out the blood before it|dries. Slaughter the remaining sheep.
{40107}{40156}No need to slaughter more.
{40159}{40230}You want people to say|my father-in-law feeds his guests
{40233}{40285}like he was fed in the Israeli prison?|No way!
{40314}{40386}- Is everything all right?|- Yes.
{40389}{40428}- Forget anything?|- No.
{40481}{40586}Abu-Salim, we need three more tables.
{40592}{40645}- Where from?|- The neighbors.
{40648}{40694}Where's Marwan?|Where did that monkey go?
{40786}{40812}Hello, Salach.
{41030}{41059}Hammed!
{41170}{41252}Doesn't Hattem's son look|just like his Aunt Mona?
{41256}{41315}No, he looks like the Russian...
{41367}{41418}Want to marry|an Israeli collaborator?
{41426}{41468}He's not. His father is.
{41471}{41522}Shut up! Don't say a word.
{41535}{41638}You're not marrying him|as long as I live. Clear?
{41720}{41787}OK, let me go back to Granddad.
{41790}{41827}You're not going anywhere!
{41846}{41921}Go to your room! Beat it!
{42031}{42071}I don't want to see you!
{42640}{42709}{Y:i}School of Social Work|at Haifa University
{43062}{43149}Marwan, how did you know|my favorite perfume?
{43200}{43245}Looks like Tallel, right?
{43299}{43352}Only God knows|if he's a good man.
{43381}{43493}If my deal goes through,|I'll buy you great gifts.
{43502}{43563}Amal, I'll buy you a car.
{43578}{43649}No... I'll take you and Amin to Italy.
{43653}{43719}- Only without Amin.|- OK, without Amin...
{43752}{43807}For you Mona, I'll get...
{43846}{43914}a private jet,|so you can come visit us.
{43949}{43998}I'll teach you how to fly it.
{44129}{44159}I'm going to look for Hattem.
{44273}{44316}And I must go help Amin
{44319}{44347}before he murders me.
{44580}{44610}{Y:i}Beat it!
{45305}{45365}{Y:i}Are you spying on me?!
{45431}{45465}Don't be angry with Dad.
{45492}{45532}You know he loves you.
{45546}{45607}His situation here|is very sensitive.
{45619}{45733}The elders came today,|threatening to cast him out, too.
{45738}{45774}And you know how they are.
{45804}{45891}It makes me mad how much I know,|but he shouldn't have given up on me.
{45894}{45938}When has he given up on you?
{45952}{46028}Didn't we grow up |in the same house?
{46040}{46083}Dad was never here for us.
{46093}{46127}Have you forgotten?
{46150}{46176}I haven't, Hattem.
{46180}{46254}But this isn't a good|time to settle accounts.
{46276}{46349}You know the Israelis won't let him|go to the border to send Mona off.
{46385}{46484}Our father is dead inside.|Don't make it any worse for him.
{46487}{46526}I'm making it worse!?
{46617}{46720}Try to understand,|for me and for Mona's sake.
{46723}{46756}Excuse me.
{46759}{46820}It'll all work out|after the wedding.
{47079}{47168}Go to our mailbox and if|you see a letter for me,
{47171}{47228}bring it and don't let|anyone know. Got it?
{47308}{47349}Mom, I'm going|to Kiryat Shmona.
{47374}{47419}Don't go to the police.
{47432}{47474}Your Dad'll be very angry.
{47477}{47585}He doesn't need to know! If he asks,|tell him I went to buy something.
{47617}{47673}You know|how much it will please Mona.
{47678}{47717}I know, I know...
{47738}{47779}Pray this day ends peacefully.
{47795}{47829}I'll be back soon.
{47923}{47976}She's blond,
{47979}{48027}but she doesn't know|how to slice a tomato.
{48040}{48113}Yes, but Hattem's wife is a doctor.
{48117}{48185}She runs a large hospital in Russia.
{48193}{48265}She probably serves him|hospital food.
{48300}{48345}All the women wanted Hattem.
{48350}{48410}He could have married|the best local girl
{48413}{48454}instead of the Russian.
{48576}{48626}This is how you slice a tomato.
{48670}{48701}Very thin.
{48905}{48939}Hello...
{48956}{49006}We... and tabula...
{49051}{49092}{Y:i}Cousin!
{49097}{49209}{Y:i}Tell the family your uncle passed away:
{49212}{49245}{Y:i}May his soul rest in peace:
{49248}{49326}{Y:i}May his soul rest in peace:
{49355}{49393}And may God strengthen you
{49396}{49478}so you can face this tragedy.
{49493}{49547}{Y:i}Hi, Dad: How are you?
{49550}{49655}How are you, Fahdi?|How are things going at university?
{49659}{49705}{Y:i}Thank God, going well:
{49708}{49801}Tell me, son, is the|wedding on as scheduled?
{49819}{49959}{Y:i}Sure, Dad: Tallel and his family|are on their way from Damascus:
{49959}{50008}{Y:i}When are you coming to the border?
{50014}{50067}I can't come.
{50080}{50155}The Israelis don't allow it.
{50158}{50241}{Y:i}I can't now. I'll call you later.|- It'll be OK, Dad:
{50272}{50346}{Y:i}How are you, Marwan?|When did you arrive?
{50398}{50494}{Y:i}Don't forget to send with Mona|a kilo of coffee from the Golan:
{50530}{50569}{Y:i}Coffee with spices:
{50628}{50696}Is everybody OK? |My plane arrives at midnight.
{50711}{50752}Will Mom be at the airport?
{50782}{50820}Is she bringing Ginger?
{50857}{50942}Send my kisses to everyone.|See you.
{52208}{52324}A fine cigar from Cuba|for my favorite uncle!
{52334}{52420}If you make it stand on your mustache,|I'll give you a bottle of whiskey!
{52462}{52522}Marwan, what do you do abroad?
{52527}{52553}Business.
{52553}{52616}But what kind of business?|What do you sell?
{52620}{52662}Whatever comes to mind.
{52677}{52717}Games for kids,
{52720}{52772}games for adults. Watches...
{52775}{52867}When'll you get married? We want|to see your kids before we die.
{52871}{52899}God willing.
{52902}{52956}God willing we see your children
{52959}{53021}or we die?
{53062}{53103}Marriage isn't for him.
{53107}{53173}He has many women. French, Italian,
{53176}{53219}even Jewish!
{53255}{53368}C'mon, what do you mean? I'll|marry a local girl in the end.
{53371}{53423}Nonsense, nonsense...
{53716}{53775}You Druze know|how to throw a wedding.
{53782}{53815}Hold my calls.
{53885}{53942}A Druze wedding is the real thing.
{53945}{54060}Not like our weddings|with the bad food...
{54070}{54115}Been to one of our weddings?
{54124}{54172}One? Why not a hundred?
{54187}{54266}I have many friends in the Golan.|In Majdal too.
{54269}{54333}Most of my friends are Druze.|Fine people.
{54336}{54389}So can my father come to the border?
{54397}{54450}- What did you say your name is?|Amal? - Yes.
{54494}{54616}How do you like your coffee?|I buy only genuine Arab coffee.
{54619}{54664}Rafi, two coffees please.
{54675}{54702}Thanks.
{54755}{54789}I can't approve it.
{54814}{54849}Sorry.
{54849}{54910}It's the last time|he'll see his daughter.
{54934}{54976}Don't take that away from him.
{54982}{55062}If not for him, do it for her.|It will break her heart.
{55069}{55114}I feel for you, truly.
{55117}{55176}He can't go near the security zone.
{55179}{55215}What harm can he do there?
{55333}{55363}Thank you, Rafi.
{55467}{55517}Drink, it's genuine Arab coffee.
{55520}{55619}I didn't come for coffee, |I came to ask you for a favor.
{55693}{55737}You can't stop me|going to the border.
{55740}{55802}- You're not going there.|- But...
{55805}{55874}No buts, you're not going,|end of story.
{55878}{55935}You treat me the same way|the Israelis treat you.
{56174}{56223}Your brother annoys me.
{56284}{56328}- Welcome.|- Congratulations.
{56331}{56385}Thank you.
{56895}{56936}Hi Uncle, how's it going?
{56991}{57041}Mom, where have you been?
{57072}{57117}- Where's Dad?|- He went home.
{57159}{57183}And Mai?
{57183}{57251}She didn't return|after the demonstration.
{57303}{57343}OK, get something to eat.
{57673}{57712}Mai isn't allowed out.
{57718}{57789}It's your fault. You're too liberal.
{57792}{57899}Amin, I didn't come here to argue.|We need to go back to the wedding.
{57917}{57979}Do you want people to|distance themselves from us?
{57986}{58022}Amal,
{58022}{58111}I love you, but I|can't stand the gossip.
{58114}{58212}"Your wife wears pants,|your daughter loves a collaborator".
{58234}{58307}Isn't the shame of|Hattem's marriage enough?
{58312}{58366}- Hattem?|- Yes, Hattem!
{58373}{58421}You can't even look him in the eyes.
{58489}{58561}This isn't the time.|We must get back to my parents.
{58564}{58633}So what are you waiting for?
{58638}{58692}- And Mai?|- She's grounded.
{58718}{58824}Let her say goodbye to Mona.|You know how attached they are.
{58844}{58877}Coming?
{58912}{58949}Only with Mai.
{59708}{59752}{Y:i}Amal Safdi has been accepted
{59755}{59821}{Y:i}into the B: A: Social Work Program:
{60007}{60084}Mom, I'm sorry I caused|you and Dad to fight.
{60131}{60196}Now he won't let you go|to university.
{60218}{60248}Don't worry.
{60273}{60307}It'll be all right.
{60345}{60390}Everything will be fine.
{60412}{60441}And you?
{60441}{60476}What about you?
{60613}{60683}God willing, your fortune|will be better than mine.
{60734}{60795}Don't give in the way I do.
{60809}{60857}Don't you dare give up!
{60885}{60936}I've already missed my chance
{60948}{61006}but your entire life is ahead of you.
{61060}{61131}Go wash your face|and rest a while,
{61180}{61248}I'll come back soon to|take you to the border.
{61263}{61306}But Dad will be furious.
{61311}{61344}Let him.
{61365}{61402}Go...
{61547}{61584}Let me kiss you.
{62539}{62595}Hello, my sweet! How are you?
{64405}{64495}Please, enjoy...
{65627}{65664}How did you find me?
{65745}{65778}You told me.
{65799}{65827}Me?
{65835}{65897}When?
{65951}{66027}"The place became crowded|and the air thick.
{66070}{66118}"I feel like I'm choking.
{66165}{66212}"I feel there's no place on earth
{66215}{66344}"which can contain|my pain and suffering.
{66394}{66479}"The apple tree is my well of secrets,
{66485}{66548}I sit under it and cry. "
{66649}{66708}I remember every word you sent me.
{66775}{66852}Your letters kept me going in Russia.
{66913}{66999}They made me feel I was|still living among you,
{67002}{67070}kept up-to-date with everyone's life.
{67249}{67310}Tell me, how are things with Amin?
{67367}{67396}As usual.
{67400}{67482}What is "as usual"?|What did you fight about?
{67488}{67533}Trivial things.
{67613}{67653}About your studies?
{67819}{67880}Amal, listen to me.
{67895}{67952}I'm not saying you should give up,
{67966}{68062}but there are ways to persuade Amin.
{68087}{68159}Amin loves and respects you.
{68204}{68256}I don't know what to say.
{68276}{68327}We haven't had a conversation in years,
{68378}{68433}I'm used to writing you letters.
{68441}{68474}It's easier for me.
{69580}{69607}What's wrong?
{69610}{69658}A tire exploded.
{69672}{69714}People, get off the bus.
{69717}{69787}We have a flat tire. God help us.
{69970}{70018}{Y:i}- Yes?|- Haven't you left yet, Joseph?
{70034}{70084}I'm leaving. What's the rush?
{70087}{70167}{Y:i}- Did you take the stamp I gave you?|- A hundred times you asked me!
{70170}{70229}{Y:i}- Did you take it?|- I did, I did:
{70233}{70295}{Y:i}Check again:
{70451}{70481}{Y:i}Well?
{70512}{70557}{Y:i}- I checked.|- Good:
{70570}{70632}Say, won't we have problems|with this new stamp?
{70638}{70714}{Y:i}No, these are the new|regulations: It's fine:
{70734}{70786}If they're the new regulations...
{70789}{70873}{Y:i}- And bring me Golan apples:|- OK, OK.
{70971}{71029}You've done a good job.
{71033}{71083}- Give this to your men.|- Thank you.
{71102}{71130}God bless you.
{71144}{71180}Dad, can I have a word?
{71311}{71374}I went to see the police|officer in Kiryat Shmona.
{71388}{71447}Amal, you made a mistake.
{71481}{71520}You humiliated yourself
{71532}{71562}and you humiliated me.
{71680}{71727}I thought it would please you.
{71782}{71823}I went there for you.
{71903}{71980}I know how much you want to|see Mona off at the border.
{72050}{72147}It wasn't easy for me to go to him,
{72191}{72263}knowing what he has done to you.
{72687}{72789}{Y:i}Plenty of wishes to the beautiful|couple, my heart wishes them well
{72803}{72907}{Y:i}Congratulate them|and spread jasmine flowers all around
{72919}{72999}{Y:i}We'll sing them wedding tunes
{73002}{73091}{Y:i}Love will reside in their home at night
{73094}{73197}{Y:i}God bless them with serenity
{73206}{73347}{Y:i}Soon, it'll be everyone's luck,|loved ones
{74070}{74130}Let's go.
{74141}{74196}Congratulations.
{74470}{74509}Marwan, I'm off.
{75177}{75230}What's wrong, Dad? Get in.
{75250}{75314}Don't worry about the elders.|They won't show up anyway.
{75319}{75383}I know... I know.
{75386}{75444}We'll worry about it|after the wedding.
{75585}{75641}Marwan, I'll be right back.
{75666}{75717}Get in, Amal.

{88130}{88189}You raise your child for 25 years
{88192}{88290}and on the most important day of|her life, you can't say goodbye?
{88293}{88354}You can't enter a closed military zone.
{88357}{88464}Military zone? Two caravans|and your Israeli flag?
{88473}{88520}You have contempt for our flag too?
{88532}{88584}Your Syrian friends |treated you better?
