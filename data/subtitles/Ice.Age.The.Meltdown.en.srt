1
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,068
This gIobaI warming is kiIIing me.

2
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:18,030
This is too hot, the lce Age was too coId.

3
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,992
What wouId it take to make you happy?

4
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,453
This l Iike.

5
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,532
Oh, no, you won't catch me.

6
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,000
No running, James. Camp ruIes.

7
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,463
Make me, sIoth.

8
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:18,716
Make me, sir. lt's aII about respect.

9
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,178
Water baII.

10
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:27,016
Sammy, you just ate. Wait an hour.
Hector, no, no, no, you can't pee-pee there.

11
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,728
OK, there is fine.
AshIey, stop picking your...

12
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,396
PiÃ±ata!

13
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:35,524
Stop! You're supposed to wear bIindfoIds.

14
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,443
OK.

15
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,946
- Hey, it's my turn to hit the sIoth.
- Mine.

16
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,989
- Mine.
- Mine.

17
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,414
Hey, you didn't have any candy in you.

18
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,875
- Let's bury him.
- Yeah!

19
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,883
Hey, whoa. Who said you kids
couId torture the sIoth?

20
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,678
Manny, don't squash their creativity.

21
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:07,556
Hey, Manny, Diego,
my bad mammaIs-jammaIs.

22
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,684
Wanna give a sIoth a hand?

23
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:16,232
Look, l opened my camp.
"Campo deI Sid." lt means Camp of Sid.

24
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,069
CongratuIations.
You're now an idiot in two Ianguages.

25
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:24,949
Not in front of the k-i-d-z.
These IittIe guys Iove me. Right, BiIIy?

26
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,451
Don't make me eat you.

27
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,579
They kid. That's why they're caIIed kids.

28
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:34,208
l toId you, Sid.
You're not quaIified to run a camp.

29
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,378
What do quaIifications
have to do with chiIdcare?

30
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:41,924
Besides, these kids Iook up to me.
l'm a roIe modeI to them.

31
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,261
l can see that.

32
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:50,474
You guys never think l can do anything,
but l'm an equaI member of this herd.

33
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:55,855
l made this herd, so you need
to start treating me with some respect.

34
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:01,235
- Come on, Sid.
- Sid, we were just kidding.

35
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,030
Hey, Iet's pIay
pin-the-taiI-on-the-mammoth.

36
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,614
Yeah!

37
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,575
Sid!

38
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,952
l can do stuff.

39
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,956
Won't give me their stupid respect.

40
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:18,961
l'II show them.

41
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:25,801
And so, in the end,
the IittIe burro reached his mommy.

42
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,637
And they Iived happiIy ever after.

43
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,018
- Good job.
- Question.

44
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:37,354
Why does the burro go home?
Why doesn't he stay with the rabbits?

45
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:41,609
Because... Because he wanted
to be with his famiIy.

46
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,904
He shouId go with the girI burro.
That's a better Iove story.

47
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,532
OK, weII, when you teII your burro story,
that's what he'II do.

48
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:52,828
Burro is a demeaning name.
TechnicaIIy, it's caIIed a wiId ass.

49
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:57,666
Fine. The wiId ass boy
came home to his wiId ass mother.

50
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,004
See, that's why l caIIed it a burro.

51
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:06,759
CouId the burro have a grazing probIem?
Then he'd be more reIatabIe.

52
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,386
- Boring.
- lt's not beIievabIe.

53
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,764
- Do burros eat their young?
- lt's not a good ending.

54
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,058
Sometimes l throw up.

55
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:19,688
They Iived happiIy ever after.
You can't get more satisfying than that.

56
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:23,317
One big, happy famiIy.
That's the way it's supposed to be.

57
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,028
Where's your big, happy famiIy?

58
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:34,120
Then the hungry tiger
ate the pesky IittIe kids.

59
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,708
- You OK, buddy?
- Sure. Why not?

60
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,461
- l thought...
- Story time's over. The end.

61
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,923
- Run for your Iives!
- Where's everybody going?

62
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,801
- The worId's coming to an end.
- What are you taIking about?

63
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,762
Fast Tony,
he says the worId's gonna fIood.

64
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,182
FoIks, l hoId in my hand
a device so powerfuI,

65
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,977
it can actuaIIy puII air right out of the sky.

66
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,061
Yeah, right.

67
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,729
Gather round, gather round.

68
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,607
Pardon me, do you have giIIs, ma'am?

69
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:06,235
So you can't breathe underwater?

70
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,779
My assistant here wiII demonstrate.

71
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,490
Hey, l can smeII the ocean.

72
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,493
What are you doing? l can't seII that now.

73
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,621
You suck air through your mouth,
you moron.

74
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,291
Through its design
and sturdy construction,

75
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,210
you'II have pIenty of air for eons to come.

76
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,255
Of course, resuIts may vary.

77
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,010
Why are you scaring everybody
with this doomsday stuff?

78
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,345
l'm trying to make a Iiving here, paI.

79
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,518
lt's my weather forecast. The five-day
outIook caIIs for intense fIooding

80
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:42,021
foIIowed by the end of the worId.

81
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,025
And a sIight chance of patchy sunshine
Iater in the week.

82
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:50,863
Come on, don't Iisten to him. Fast Tony
wouId seII his own mother for a grape.

83
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:55,451
Are you making an offer?
l mean, no, l wouId not.

84
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,786
Haven't you heard? The ice is meIting.

85
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,456
You see this ground, it's covered in ice.

86
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,042
A thousand years ago,
it was covered in ice.

87
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,961
A thousand years from now,
it wiII stiII be ice.

88
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:10,424
Say, buddy, not to cast aspersions
on your survivaI instincts or nothing,

89
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,719
but haven't mammoths
pretty much gone extinct?

90
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,389
- What are you taIking about?
- About you being the Iast of your kind.

91
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,809
Your breath smeIIs Iike ants.

92
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:28,108
Be that as it may, when's the Iast time
you saw another mammoth?

93
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,278
Don't pay any attention to him.

94
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,573
Mammoths can't go extinct.
They're the biggest things on Earth.

95
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,450
What about the dinosaurs?

96
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,953
The dinosaurs got cocky
and made enemies.

97
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,539
Look. Some idiot's
going down the Eviscerator.

98
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,167
PIease teII me that's not our idiot.

99
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:50,547
OK, l'm gonna jump on the count of three.

100
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,009
One,

101
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,844
two...

102
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,473
Sid, don't move a muscIe.
We're coming up.

103
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:03,435
Jump! Jump! Jump!

104
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,687
Sorry.

105
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,899
Two and three one-thousandths,
two and four one-thousandths...

106
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:11,819
Sid, what are you doing?
Get down from there.

107
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,738
No. l'm gonna be the first
to jump off the Eviscerator

108
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,992
and then you guys are gonna have to
show me some respect.

109
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:21,453
The onIy respect you'II get
is respect for the dead.

110
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,706
Come on, Manny, he's not that stupid.

111
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,044
- But l've been wrong before.
- Geronimo!

112
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:33,882
Hey, watch it.

113
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:45,060
l can't breathe.
l think l just coughed up my spIeen.

114
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:03,954
- Diego, retract the cIaws, pIease.
- Right. Sorry.

115
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:08,917
lf l didn't know you better, Diego,
l'd think you were afraid of the water.

116
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,503
OK, OK. Good thing l know you better.

117
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,088
Guys.

118
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,924
Fast Tony was right.

119
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,427
Everything is meIting.

120
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,207
lt's aII gonna fIood.
Come on, we gotta warn them.

121
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,210
Maybe we can rapidIy evoIve
into water creatures.

122
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:55,255
- That's genius, Sid.
- CaII me Squid.

123
00:11:56,383 --> 00:12:01,553
This whoIe thing's a piece ofjunk.
l can't beIieve l Iive here.

124
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,015
What?

125
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:15,901
Forget reeds. l present you with this
revoIutionary gizmo we caII bark.

126
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:21,073
- lt's so buoyant, it actuaIIy fIoats.
- l'II show you something that fIoats.

127
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,992
AII right, it's your funeraI.

128
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,713
See? This is exactIy
what l'm taIking about.

129
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,424
Giants baIIs of furry Iava

130
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,759
the size of mammoths
raining from the sky.

131
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:43,387
Go suck air through a reed.

132
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:49,435
- Listen to him. He's right about the fIood.
- l am? l mean, yes, l am.

133
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,022
Wait. You said there wasn't going to be
a fIood. Why shouId we Iisten to you?

134
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,316
Because we saw what's up there.

135
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,945
The dam's gonna break.
The entire vaIIey's gonna fIood.

136
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:06,368
FIood's reaI, aII right. And it's coming fast.

137
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,413
Look around. You're in a bowI.

138
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,668
BowI's gonna fiII up. Ain't no way out.

139
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,712
What are we gonna do?

140
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,466
UnIess you make it
to the end of the vaIIey.

141
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,427
There's a boat. lt can save you.

142
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,638
- l don't see anything.
- But

143
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,640
y'aII better hurry.

144
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:33,395
Ground's meIting,
waIIs tumbIing, rocks crumbIing.

145
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,607
Survive that
and you'II be racing the water,

146
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:40,819
cos in three days' time,
it's gonna hit the geyser fieIds.

147
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:41,987
Boom!

148
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,241
There is some good news, though.

149
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,744
The more of you die,

150
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,746
the better l eat.

151
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,584
l didn't say it was good news for you.

152
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,050
He must have been
a reaI pIeasure to have in cIass.

153
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,242
Dam.

154
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:32,955
AII right, you heard the scary vuIture.
Let's move out.

155
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,791
Manny, you reaIIy think there's a boat?

156
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,419
l don't know, but in a few days,
this pIace is gonna be underwater.

157
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,964
lf there's any hope, it's that way.

158
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,362
Manny, Iet's go.

159
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:31,471
Overturned gIyptodont in the far right Iane.
Traffic backed up as far as the eye can see.

160
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:34,891
And it Iooks Iike there might be a fataIity.

161
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,852
l caII the dark meat.

162
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:41,565
Come on, everybody, Iet's go.
Come on, come, come, come. Get in.

163
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,946
- Come on, Grandpa, come on.
- We have to go.

164
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,448
WeII, l'm not Ieaving.

165
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:53,660
l was born in this hoIe
and l'II die in this hoIe.

166
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,587
Do we have to bring this crap?

167
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:08,759
- l'm sure there's crap where we're going.
- This was a gift from my mother.

168
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,136
OK, keep it moving, keep it moving.

169
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,972
Manny, l just heard you're going extinct.

170
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:17,726
Hey, if you ever master hygiene,
try working on sensitivity.

171
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:23,106
- l'm not going extinct.
- Kids, Iook. The Iast mammoth.

172
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,779
WeII, you probabIy won't see
another one of those again.

173
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,030
See?

174
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,241
OK, one, two, three... Where is James?

175
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,616
Stu. Come on, Stu.

176
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,244
Let's bIow this ice-cube stand.

177
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,789
Stu.

178
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,006
FoIks, be the first in the vaIIey
to have your very own mobiIe home.

179
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,310
- Shut up, Sid.
- OK.

180
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,067
Stop singing, Sid.

181
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:03,702
Sid, l'm going to faII on you again
and this time l wiII kiII you.

182
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,872
OK, someone doesn't Iike the cIassics.

183
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,718
What if you're right?

184
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,720
What if l am the Iast mammoth?

185
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:25,098
But Manny, Iook at the bright side,
you have us.

186
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,976
Not your most persuasive argument, Sid.

187
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,442
- Mammoths?
- l knew l couIdn't be the Iast one.

188
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,319
l feIt it in my gut.

189
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,499
Extinct? Come on.

190
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:58,381
He's up by a coupIe of fifths,
ahead by a tusk.

191
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:01,343
And he's beating Diego
as Diego's coming round the corner.

192
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:12,520
Sorry. My stomach hates me.

193
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:19,402
WeII, don't that put
the "stink" in extinction?

194
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:22,489
Nasty.

195
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,493
Manny.

196
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,373
l need to be aIone for a whiIe.

197
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,209
You go on ahead. l'II catch up.

198
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,052
One truIy is the IoneIiest number.

199
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,350
These work great.

200
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:51,726
CooI.

201
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:57,023
- Missed me, now you gotta kiss me.
- l'II get them.

202
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,861
- Which end is up?
- l'd hide that face too.

203
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:05,699
- Hey, ugIy.
- l gotta sit on that.

204
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:11,746
Gotcha.

205
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,422
OK, l'm going in.

206
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,175
- Sid.
- What?

207
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,969
- Nice miss.
- Cover your side.

208
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,847
- l feIt some breeze in that one.
- SmiIe.

209
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,354
- Out of my way.
- HeIIo.

210
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,981
Over here.

211
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,068
- Surrender?
- Never.

212
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:43,278
CooI.

213
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:45,947
Smoke them.

214
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:58,084
lf anyone asks, there were 50 of them
and they were rattIesnakes.

215
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,713
- Here, kitty, kitty.
- Big mistake, you miscreants.

216
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,132
Miscreants?

217
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,218
Diego, they're possums.

218
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:12,390
Retreat.

219
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,835
l guess it's just you and me now.

220
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,725
l knew it. l knew l wasn't the onIy one.

221
00:23:55,810 --> 00:24:00,188
Everyone faIIs out of the tree now
and then. They just don't admit it.

222
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,689
Wait. What?

223
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:04,400
Some of us have a tough time
hoIding on to branches.

224
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:08,404
lt's not Iike we're bats or something.
We don't have wings to keep us up.

225
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:12,534
And you were in the tree because...

226
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,371
l was Iooking for my brothers.
They are aIways in troubIe.

227
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,957
Brothers? You mean there's more?

228
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,250
Sure.

229
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,003
- There's Iots of us.
- Where?

230
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:28,174
Everywhere.
Under rocks. ln hoIes in the ground.

231
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:31,302
UsuaIIy we come out at night
so birds don't carry us off.

232
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:33,471
HeIp! HeIp!

233
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:35,473
HeIp!

234
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,564
WeII, shave me down
and caII me a moIe rat.

235
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,232
You found another mammoth.

236
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:48,361
Where? Wait a minute.
l thought mammoths were extinct.

237
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:54,492
- What are you Iooking at me for?
- l don't know. Because you're a mammoth.

238
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:59,247
Me? Don't be ridicuIous.
l'm not a mammoth. l'm a possum.

239
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:03,168
Right. Good one. l'm a newt.
This is my friend, the badger.

240
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,211
And my other friend, the pIatypus.

241
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:08,882
Why do l gotta be the pIatypus?
Make him the pIatypus.

242
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:12,093
- This guy giving you troubIe, sis?
- Sis?

243
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:17,432
That's right. These are my brothers.
Possum, possum, possum.

244
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:21,603
l don't think her tree
goes aII the way to the top branch.

245
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:27,025
Manny, brink of extinction's
a bad time to be picky.

246
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,194
Hey, she shouId come with us.

247
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,863
Are you insane? No way.

248
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,323
OK.

249
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:37,619
Manny wants me to ask you
if you'd Iike to escape the fIood with us.

250
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,122
- l'd rather be road kiII.
- That can be arranged.

251
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:46,127
Funny. Let me have a IittIe word
with my brothers.

252
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:49,088
EIIie, are you crazy?
We're not going with them.

253
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:52,634
Look, we'II never make it in time
if we onIy traveI at night.

254
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:56,930
These guys can protect us out in the open.
What do you say?

255
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,099
Why did you invite them?

256
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:03,353
Cos you might be
the onIy two mammoths Ieft on Earth.

257
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:07,440
- He has a point.
- Sorry, when did l join this dating service?

258
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:11,986
My brothers and l
wouId be deIighted to come with you.

259
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,447
lf you treat us niceIy.

260
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,242
See that? That's the totaI opposite of nice.

261
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,953
Maybe we'II have a snack
before we hit the road.

262
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:23,081
You want a piece of us? Let's go.

263
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,916
Banzai!

264
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,252
- l got them.
- Back! Back!

265
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:32,298
You know the best part?
We're carrying diseases.

266
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:42,850
OK, thanks to Sid,
we're now traveIing together.

267
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:46,396
And Iike it or not,
we're going to be one big, happy famiIy.

268
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,774
l'II be the daddy, EIIie wiII be the mommy.

269
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:53,653
And Diego wiII be the uncIe
who eats the kids who get on my nerves.

270
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:57,865
Now, Iet's move it before the ground
faIIs out from under our feet.

271
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,785
l thought fat guys
were supposed to be joIIy.

272
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:04,872
l'm not fat.
lt's this fur, it makes me Iook big.

273
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:08,084
- lt's poofy.
- OK.

274
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,419
He's fat.

275
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:48,374
Escaping the fIood is the perfect time
to shed those unsightIy pounds

276
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:51,252
with Fast Tony's Disaster Diet.

277
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:56,758
You, ma'am, you Iook
Iike a big, fat, hairy beast.

278
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:59,719
How wouId you Iike to Iose a ton or two?

279
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,220
WouId l ever.

280
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:05,933
Don't Iisten to him, Vera.
You're aIready thin as a twig.

281
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:10,146
l aIso have the perfect cure
for your eyesight, my bIind friend.

282
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,845
We'II never make it at this pace.

283
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:47,100
EIIie, it's OK, you can
Iose the camoufIage. You're safe.

284
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:50,395
OK. Safe? PIease.

285
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,397
Crash, Eddie, you two go scope it out.

286
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,816
- What you got?
- Perimeter aII cIear.

287
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,444
- Roger that. One-niner, over.
- Roger, over, victor...

288
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,614
- Guys.
- AII cIear.

289
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,539
Hawk!

290
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:20,925
- What are you doing?
- PIaying dead.

291
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:24,846
- Manny, why don't you do that?
- Because l'm a mammoth.

292
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,598
But you'd do it for treats, right?

293
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,767
ls he gone?

294
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,772
You're safe. Get up.

295
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,358
Man.

296
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:38,693
lf you weren't here,

297
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:42,071
that hawk wouId have swooped down
and snatched me for dinner.

298
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:44,240
That's how cousin WiIton went.

299
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,954
Boy, l reaIIy feeI for you. l do.

300
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:54,125
l can't even imagine what it'd be Iike
to be the Iast one of your species.

301
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:58,880
- l'm not the Iast one.
- You brave, brave souI.

302
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,841
That's right. Don't give up hope.

303
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,760
EIIie.

304
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,555
Look at our footprints.

305
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:10,725
They're the same shape.

306
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,769
WeII, how do l know
those aren't your footprints?

307
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:15,813
WeII, then,

308
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:18,232
Iook at our shadows.

309
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,443
We match.

310
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,613
You're right. They're the same.

311
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,740
You must be part possum.

312
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,620
You wish.

313
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:47,345
Diego, there are whoIe continents
moving faster than you.

314
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,722
We gotta catch up with the others.

315
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,067
Hey. Knock it off.

316
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:07,281
Cry me a river, bIubber-tooth tiger.
Have some fun.

317
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:11,077
The ice is thin enough
without you two wearing it down.

318
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,162
Diego, come on. The ice may be thin,

319
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:17,416
but it's strong enough to hoId a ten-ton
mammoth and a nine-ton possum.

320
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:43,401
MammaI overboard!

321
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:01,419
EIIie, get up.
lf you pIay dead, you'II be dead.

322
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:02,878
Look at me.

323
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:21,063
Diego.

324
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:32,992
Come on, Diego. Come on.

325
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:37,705
This may sting a IittIe.

326
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,189
- What in the animaI kingdom was that?
- l don't know.

327
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:49,068
From now on, Iand, safe, water, not safe.

328
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:58,077
That was the bravest thing l've ever seen.

329
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,330
- lt was nothing. l...
- lt's not a compIiment.

330
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:03,374
To a possum, bravery is just dumb.

331
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,293
- Yeah, we're spineIess.
- LiIy-Iivered.

332
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:10,214
Maybe mammoths are going extinct
because they get in danger.

333
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,008
Maybe you shouId run away more.

334
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:15,261
Good point. Thanks for the advice.

335
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:16,971
Happy to heIp.

336
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:22,601
Do you beIieve her? "Bravery is dumb.
Maybe you shouId run away more."

337
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:25,646
She's infuriating
and stubborn and narrow-minded.

338
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,441
You Iike her.

339
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:32,987
- l do not.
- Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

340
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,531
- And so is yours.
- What secret?

341
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,325
You know, the one where you can't swim.

342
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:42,413
- That's ridicuIous.
- Fine. But we're Iiving in a meIting worId.

343
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:46,167
You're going to have to
face your fear sooner or Iater.

344
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,479
AImost there.

345
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:51,565
- OK. Ready, Eddie?
- Set.

346
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,651
Let's roII.

347
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,988
Wait for me.

348
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,711
No brakes. Gotta roII.
Meet you at the other end.

349
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:16,006
So you think she's the girI for me?

350
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:19,134
Yeah. She's tons of fun
and you're no fun at aII.

351
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:21,554
She compIetes you.

352
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,432
Yeah.

353
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:30,020
Hey, Manny. Can you puII back the tree
and shoot me into the pond?

354
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,273
- No.
- Come on.

355
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:36,652
- You expect to impress with that attitude?
- l don't want to impress.

356
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,530
Why are you trying
to convince her she's a mammoth?

357
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:43,367
Because that's what she is.
l don't care if she thinks she's a possum.

358
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:47,580
- You can't be two things.
- Au contraire, Man-fered.

359
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:50,291
TeII that to the buIIfrog,
chicken hawk or turtIedove.

360
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,084
He's never gonna Iet up on you.

361
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:55,504
lt'II be easier on aII of us
if you just go with it.

362
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:03,053
- So what do you want me to do?
- PuII the tree and shoot me into the pond.

363
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,722
l don't know.

364
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:07,808
lf you're too Iame to do it, we can get EIIie.

365
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:10,561
No, no, no. No, l can do it. l can do it.

366
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,521
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, come on.

367
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:16,066
- Have you done this before?
- OnIy a miIIion times.

368
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:19,111
Farther, farther, farther.

369
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:22,072
Perfect. Fire!

370
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,660
Yeah! l can fIy!

371
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,049
Crash!

372
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,178
Crash! Crash!

373
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:47,264
- Crash, are you OK?
- What happened?

374
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:50,434
- Manny shot him out of a tree.
- What's wrong with you?

375
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,646
- He said he couId do it.
- And you Iistened to him?

376
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:57,107
Crash, whatever you do,
don't go into the Iight.

377
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:59,234
Can l heIp in any way here?

378
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:01,362
You've done enough.

379
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:07,368
- Are you happy now?
- Crash, Crash, don't Ieave me.

380
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,787
Who's gonna watch my back?

381
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:13,457
Who's gonna be my wingman of mayhem?

382
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:17,378
Who's gonna roII
in that dung patch with me?

383
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:19,964
Dung patch?

384
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:24,677
- Wait. My Iegs. l can stand.
- He can stand.

385
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:28,597
- l can run.
- He can run. lt's a miracIe.

386
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:30,599
HaIIeIujah!

387
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:42,069
What can l say? They're boys.
They make my Iife a IittIe adventure.

388
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,406
You guys are so dead.
Thanks for embarrassing me.

389
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,574
Not the face.

390
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,504
EIIie, EIIie, me too.

391
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,631
She's not haIf bad.

392
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,594
Crazy and confused, but sweet.

393
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:08,679
So?

394
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:13,517
So what's hoIding you back?

395
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:17,771
My famiIy.

396
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:24,028
You can have that again, you know.

397
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,196
No, Sid, l can't.

398
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:31,452
OK, OK, but think about it.
l mean, if you Iet this chance go,

399
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:36,415
you're Ietting your whoIe species go
and that's just... That's just seIfish.

400
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:46,091
l think l'm starting to get through to him.

401
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:50,471
- Wait, wait. l got you.
- SIowpoke.

402
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:58,562
- Need heIp?
- No, no. Just catching my breath.

403
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,273
- You're stuck.
- l am not.

404
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,358
AII right, then, Iet's go.

405
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,362
l can't.

406
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:09,698
l'm stuck.

407
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:14,161
Don't you think that
picking them up Iike this wouId be easier?

408
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:32,429
EIIie?

409
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,579
l know this pIace.

410
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:05,415
You know, deep down,
l knew l was different.

411
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:11,088
l was a IittIe bigger
than the other possum kids.

412
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,341
OK, a Iot bigger.

413
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:20,514
Now l understand why the possum boys
didn't find me appeaIing.

414
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:26,144
That's too bad,
because as far as mammoths go, you're,

415
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,605
- you know.
- What?

416
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:35,320
Attractive.

417
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:38,365
- ReaIIy?
- Sure.

418
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,701
What about me is attractive?

419
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,872
l don't know.

420
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:48,083
WeII, there's your

421
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:50,669
butt.

422
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,256
What about it?

423
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,550
lt's

424
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:58,593
big.

425
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:02,264
You're just saying that.

426
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:05,058
No, no, no, l mean it.

427
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,646
lt's huge. Biggest darn butt l've ever seen.

428
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:12,149
That is reaIIy sweet.

429
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,027
What a crazy day.

430
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:20,240
This morning l woke up a possum
and now l'm a mammoth.

431
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,099
Boy, Manny sure took a big Ieap
with EIIie today.

432
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:10,976
Sure did.

433
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:16,189
He stood on the shore of uncertainty
and dove right in. SpIash.

434
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,985
Kind of brave, huh?
The way he faced his fear.

435
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:23,113
l wouIdn't know. Sabers don't feeI fear.

436
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:28,201
Come on, aII animaIs feeI fear.
lt's what separates us from, say, rocks.

437
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:30,620
Rocks have no fear.

438
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:33,957
- And they sink.
- What are you getting at, Sid?

439
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:38,795
lt may surprise you to know
that l, too, have experienced fear.

440
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:41,006
No. You?

441
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,633
Yeah. Yes, as impossibIe as it seems,

442
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:49,055
the sIoth has naturaI enemies that wouId
Iike to harm or otherwise "kiII" us.

443
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,309
- l wonder why?
- JeaIousy, mostIy.

444
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:55,228
But the point is that fear is naturaI.

445
00:46:56,606 --> 00:46:59,024
Fear is for prey.

446
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:02,736
WeII, then, you're Ietting
the water make you its prey.

447
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:05,614
Just jump in and trust your instincts.

448
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:09,493
You know,
most animaIs can swim as babies.

449
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:15,373
And for a tiger, it's Iike crawIing
on your beIIy to staIk heIpIess prey.

450
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:20,879
But faster, OK?
Now, cIaw, kick, cIaw, kick.

451
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,840
l'm staIking the prey. CIaw, kick.

452
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:26,760
l Iook back over my shouIder
to see if l'm being foIIowed.

453
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,054
And l'm breathing.

454
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:32,933
And l'm staIking and l'm staIking and l'm...

455
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:38,438
- l'm faIIing.
- Correction. You're sinking.

456
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,607
Kind of Iike a rock.

457
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,907
Hey, do we do any speciaI tricks
Iike roII over?

458
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,743
Or do we just throw our weight around?

459
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,578
Whoops. Sorry.

460
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:56,373
l don't know my own strength yet.

461
00:47:56,457 --> 00:48:00,794
EIIie, do you reaIize that now
we have a chance to save our species?

462
00:48:01,254 --> 00:48:05,632
- ReaIIy? How are we gonna do that?
- WeII, you know...

463
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:07,717
Did you just...

464
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:11,388
l'm not a mammoth for five minutes
and you're hitting on me?

465
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:15,141
l wasn't saying... Not right now. ln time.

466
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:18,687
l was just saying
that it's our responsibiIity.

467
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:19,896
What?

468
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:22,524
AII right, that came out wrong. l...

469
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,609
You're very pretty, but we just met...

470
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,946
ResponsibiIity?
Just doing your duty? ls that it?

471
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:31,866
Ready to make the uItimate sacrifice
to save your species.

472
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:37,539
l got some news for you. You're not saving
the species tonight or any other night.

473
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:51,636
- So, how did it go?
- Not bad.

474
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:02,188
OK, Iet's go. We traveIed with you aII day,
now you're coming with us at night.

475
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,482
But we can't see at night.

476
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:06,693
Then enjoy the fIood.

477
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:09,654
l can't even Iook at him.

478
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:11,197
Pervert.

479
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:21,416
Making friends everywhere you go.
Just making friends.

480
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,777
- Watch out, there's a stump.
- Not anymore.

481
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:52,906
l thought we couId waIk together.

482
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:56,034
Crash, ask the mammoth
why he thinks that.

483
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:59,245
She said she thinks you're a jerk
and to go away.

484
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,247
She didn't say...

485
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:05,043
Look, maybe if we spend more time...

486
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:09,005
TeII him that l need
a IittIe personaI space right now.

487
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:13,593
- She said go jump in a Iake.
- And possums ruIe.

488
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:17,389
- l can hear her, you know.
- What do you want? A medaI?

489
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,653
Stop moving.

490
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:36,282
Thank you.

491
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:46,418
Manny, EIIie. Lock trunks.

492
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:50,463
Now!

493
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,763
Crash, Eddie. Grab on to that Iedge.

494
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,856
- Funny. Now what's your reaI pIan?
- Just do it.

495
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,567
- Bye, Eddie.
- Bye, Crash.

496
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:12,819
- Bye, EIIie.
- Go now.

497
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,994
l'm sorry if what l said before
offended you.

498
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,621
What do you mean "if" it offended me?

499
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:27,083
That it offended her!

500
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:29,919
l mean that, that it offended you.

501
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:36,468
- You just overreacted, that's aII.
- What?

502
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:39,804
- Take it back.
- There are other Iives at stake here.

503
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:42,223
- He's got a point.
- He's got nothing.

504
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:44,934
- lt was a misunderstanding.
- lt was insensitive.

505
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:48,229
- ApoIogize.
- Why me? She overreacted.

506
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:50,440
- Just apoIogize.
- No.

507
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:53,318
- Do it.
- OK, l'm sorry.

508
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:54,903
What?

509
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:57,280
- He's right. l overreacted.
- You mean...

510
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:01,868
Not another word or l'II come down there
and push you over myseIf.

511
00:52:02,495 --> 00:52:05,371
l got it. l got it.

512
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:07,040
l got it.

513
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,715
Manny, EIIie, run! Run!

514
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:31,815
l guess we finaIIy
did something right together.

515
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:36,194
Hey, don't mind me.
Just hanging off the edge of a cIiff here.

516
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:59,926
- Remember the good oId days?
- Which good oId days?

517
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:03,429
You know. Yesterday, Iast week.

518
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:08,309
Back when the trees went up and down
and the ground stayed under our feet.

519
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,646
Yep. Those were the good days.

520
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:15,692
Possums were possums
and mammoths were mammoths.

521
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:18,862
- We shouId get some sIeep.
- Yeah.

522
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,949
Tomorrow's the day
the vuIture said we're aII going to die.

523
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:41,152
Wait a minute.

524
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:43,696
Can l heIp you?

525
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:57,794
Now, that's what l caII respect.

526
00:54:59,672 --> 00:55:00,922
Nice.

527
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:10,306
Somebody here Iikes Sid.

528
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:14,602
Who is your decorator?
l mean, this is fabuIous.

529
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:21,275
Fire King.

530
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:34,330
Fire King? WeII, you know, it's about time
someone recognized my true potentiaI.

531
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:36,499
Let there be fire.

532
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:48,821
lf onIy the guys couId see me now.

533
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:53,618
This is either reaIIy good or reaIIy bad.

534
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:57,080
No, no, no.

535
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:59,624
Me Fire King. Why kiII Fire King?

536
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:03,294
A thousand years'
bad juju for kiIIing Fire King.

537
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:06,297
Super-heated rock from Earth's core
is surging to the crust,

538
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,591
meIting ice buiIt up
over thousands of years.

539
00:57:08,801 --> 00:57:12,595
You're a very advanced race.
Together, we can Iook for a soIution.

540
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:15,473
We have one, sacrifice the Fire King.

541
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:18,392
- WeII, that's not very advanced.
- Worth a shot.

542
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:20,728
No! No!

543
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:38,996
Bad juju!

544
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:03,729
Water? Water!

545
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:14,907
- Crash, l toId you not to drink before bed.
- l didn't do this. At Ieast, not aII of it.

546
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:18,369
- What's happening?
- We oversIept. We need to move.

547
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:23,291
What if we're the Iast creatures Ieft aIive?
We'II have to repopuIate the Earth.

548
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:26,711
How?
Everyone's either a dude or our sister.

549
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,214
Hi. Hey, Manny.

550
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:33,301
Wow. What a night.
You'II never guess what happened.

551
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:36,095
You were sIeepwaIking.

552
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:39,515
No, no, no.
l was kidnapped by a tribe of mini sIoths.

553
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,852
- That was gonna be my second guess.
- And they worshiped me.

554
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:47,356
l mean, sure, they tossed me into
a fIaming tar pit, but they worshiped me.

555
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:49,108
You were dreaming.

556
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:51,319
Come on, the water's rising faster
than we're moving.

557
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:56,365
l'm teIIing you, l was kidnapped.
l was worshiped. Guys.

558
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:58,534
Fine.

559
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:09,462
Can we sIow down a IittIe? l'm dying here.

560
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:15,801
lt was just a figure of speech.

561
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:24,435
They just sit there, watching us.

562
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,813
l wish l knew what they were thinking.

563
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:03,659
There. Now you know
what they were thinking.

564
01:01:09,458 --> 01:01:12,084
- Sid!
- What? lt's catchy.

565
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:28,601
- We made it.
- Yeah, we showed those scary vuItures.

566
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:58,839
lt's just a IittIe hot water and steam.
How bad couId it be?

567
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:09,225
l just did something
invoIuntary and messy.

568
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:12,144
OK, come on.

569
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:16,190
Manny. Get back. lt's a minefieId out there.

570
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:18,984
There's onIy one way to go.
Straight through.

571
01:02:19,194 --> 01:02:22,863
Straight through? We'd Iike to
keep the fur on our bodies, thank you.

572
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:26,575
- We'II head back and go around.
- There's no time.

573
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:29,453
The dam wiII burst before we make it.
We'II drown.

574
01:02:29,538 --> 01:02:31,997
lf we go through this,
we get bIown to bits.

575
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:33,916
- We go forward.
- We go back.

576
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,335
- Forward.
- Back.

577
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,546
- Can l say something?
- No.

578
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:43,634
- You are so stubborn and hard-headed.
- WeII, l guess that proves it.

579
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:45,719
l am a mammoth.

580
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:50,391
- Come on.
- Fine.

581
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:54,145
l don't know. Drowning sounds Iike
a much gentIer way to go.

582
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:57,773
BIown to bits sounds so sudden.

583
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:11,370
He's going to get himseIf kiIIed.
Manny, wait.

584
01:03:11,872 --> 01:03:13,414
Manny.

585
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:39,148
Kids, Iook, the Iast mammoth.

586
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:41,400
l just heard you're going extinct.

587
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:45,070
- You can't be two things.
- She thinks you're a jerk.

588
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:47,823
Where's your big, happy famiIy?

589
01:03:47,908 --> 01:03:50,284
What's wrong with you?

590
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:52,786
Manny, come on. We gotta go. Now!

591
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:01,712
That way.

592
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:47,466
Do not Ieave your chiIdren unattended.
AII unattended chiIdren wiII be eaten.

593
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:53,722
- Have you seen a mammoth?
- No, sorry.

594
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:55,808
- Have you seen a mammoth?
- No.

595
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:59,228
Possum? About 1 1 foot taII?

596
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:04,066
- Hey, buddy, have you seen a mammoth?
- l sure have. Big as Iife.

597
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,151
- Where?
- l'm Iooking at him.

598
01:05:06,695 --> 01:05:08,821
Not me.

599
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,906
Poor guy doesn't know he's a mammoth.

600
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:14,470
- l don't see her anywhere.
- Maybe she's aIready on board.

601
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:30,402
Hurry, this way. Come on.

602
01:06:32,781 --> 01:06:36,241
- There it is.
- EIIie! HeIp!

603
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,919
Come on, come on, run!

604
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:55,177
Push.

605
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:01,850
- You guys gotta go.
- We're not Ieaving you.

606
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:04,228
- l'm not asking.
- EIIie, no.

607
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:09,650
EIIie, don't worry. We're going for heIp.

608
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:11,527
Stay here.

609
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:29,878
- HeIp us.
- HeIp! Somebody heIp.

610
01:07:29,963 --> 01:07:33,966
Manny.

611
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:41,432
- Manny.
- lt's EIIie, she's trapped in a cave.

612
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:42,743
EIIie.

613
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:44,953
Manny.

614
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:52,169
- HeIp!
- l'II save you.

615
01:08:56,716 --> 01:08:58,884
Great. Who's gonna save him?

616
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:03,806
You reaIIy need to brush.

617
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:12,231
OK, OK, OK. Jump in now.

618
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,485
Come on, 'fraidy cat. Come on.

619
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,362
You can do this, you can do this,
you can do this.

620
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,574
Trust your instincts. Attack the water.

621
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:25,160
l am not your prey. l am not your prey.

622
01:09:25,245 --> 01:09:27,538
l am not your prey.

623
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:52,896
Attack the water. StaIking the prey.

624
01:09:52,981 --> 01:09:56,942
CIaw, kick. Even babies can do it. Come on.

625
01:09:57,026 --> 01:10:00,863
CIaw, kick, cIaw, kick.

626
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:03,949
Hey. l'm staIking the prey.

627
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:11,373
Eddie.

628
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:29,433
You did it, buddy. You kicked water's butt.

629
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:32,978
Nothing to it. Most animaIs
can swim as babies, you know.

630
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:36,315
Yeah, but not tigers. l Ieft that part out.

631
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:54,583
There he is.

632
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:56,960
EIIie, hoId on to me.

633
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:31,328
Manny, Manny, behind you.

634
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:10,409
There they are.

635
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:12,911
They made it.

636
01:12:24,048 --> 01:12:26,967
We thought we'd never see you again.

637
01:12:36,436 --> 01:12:38,478
We're gonna Iive.

638
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:45,110
We're gonna die.

639
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:40,684
WeII, l'm not Ieaving.

640
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:43,812
Grandpa, Iet go of the boat.
The fIood's over.

641
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:47,524
- This is my boat now.
- Come on, Iet's go. Come on, come on.

642
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:52,612
Stu. We made it. We're gonna Iive.

643
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:55,282
WeII, l am anyway.

644
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:00,829
l'm thinking about starting a swim schooI.

645
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:03,415
Sid's Squids.

646
01:15:08,546 --> 01:15:10,881
AII haiI Fire King.

647
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:17,554
Hi.

648
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:28,148
Fire King avert fIood.
Join us, O great and nobIe fIaming one.

649
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:35,655
No, not so fast there, OK.
You make a quaIity offer.

650
01:15:35,907 --> 01:15:41,203
But Fire King has a prior commitment.
His herd needs him.

651
01:15:41,996 --> 01:15:48,376
He is the gooey, sticky stuff
that hoIds us together.

652
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:54,758
He made this herd,
and we'd be nothing without him.

653
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:58,887
- You mean it?
- Sid. Sid.

654
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:01,806
That doesn't mean "want to touch".

655
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:08,939
Don't ask.
