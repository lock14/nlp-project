2
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,399
Elaine!

3
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,541
You're never gonna sleep again.

4
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,580
That's the point.

5
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:40,912
Right.

6
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,250
Let me know if you
want to switch seats.

7
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,454
We're close.

8
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,101
No, this should'a been all ours...

9
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,832
Fucking Feds come in here,
we don't even make the local news.

10
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,034
I'm jacked! Three surviving witnesses...
Feds...

11
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,006
I'm fucking jacked!

12
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,407
Wow... handsome... looking good.
Coffee's on.

13
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,473
No, no, no... this is
for the little one...

14
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:44,814
Hot chocolate.

15
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:46,348
Here's where we come in?

16
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,852
Easy now. Both of you...

17
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,034
And a little girl, she's 8 or 9...

18
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,006
and I guess she's not saying
much right now.

19
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:15,505
They're guessing.

20
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,881
With kids, it's different.

21
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,579
I'll be fine by it.
How about you?

22
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,391
She's gonna be a mess.

23
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,051
We don't know what she saw.

24
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,026
Fuck, Anderson!
We know.

25
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,099
Listen...

26
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,068
They call 'em witnesses
because they've seen things.

27
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,827
So we go in, find out.

28
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,907
- You good?
- I'm good.

29
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,747
You real good...

30
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,048
You know it.

31
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,087
Let's do it.

32
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,194
- Billings...
- Agent Hallaway.

33
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:07,232
And this is Officer Degrasso...
Officer Wright.

34
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,301
Agent Anderson.

35
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:15,965
Up-to-date witness files,
they all describe the same thing.

36
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,202
Hasn't gotten us much of anywhere.

37
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,972
We're pretty sure we know
what were dealing with here.

38
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,511
And they all arrived together,
late yesterday?

39
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:25,879
Yeah, that's the way it happened.

40
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,817
One of our Officers brought them in...

41
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,447
he's in there too,
he's also a witness.

42
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,291
I understand one of your
officers was killed?

43
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,957
Yeah. Jim. Jim Conrad.

44
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:43,993
Now, the young woman she seems to
be intoxicated or in shock; the child...

45
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,506
The 'young woman' is high
as a fucking kite.

46
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,235
As I was saying...

47
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,140
The child hasn't said much of anything.

48
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:54,611
However, she has bonded with
the young woman...

49
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,773                
Bobbi... Bobbi Prescott.

50
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,816
And is this all she said?

51
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,785
Yeah, only what we took notes on.

52
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,714
The things that have happened to her,
you can't blame her.

53
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,725
And you have no female officers
here, is that right?

54
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,021
Have two of you always
been present?

55
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,220
Well I was there...
Hi, I'm Janet.

56
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:13,094
Welcome, I could,
can I get coffee for any...

57
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,566
That little girl's name's Stephanie...

58
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,904
'cause Officer Bennett told me
that her name was Stephanie.

59
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,338
We'll need to separate them
for the interviews.

60
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,874
They really should have been
kept apart during the night.

61
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,137
I trust my Officer.

62
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,279
I never said I didn't.

63
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:36,814
You know, I'm sure that proper
procedures were followed, Hallaway.

64
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:42,485
It's interesting that you're the one
that brought up the trust thing.

65
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:46,863
Great. Sam? I'm gonna take
a minute with the little girl, Sam.

66
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,058
Take a few minutes.

67
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:54,504
So, we brought equipment with us,
while I'm in talking with her...

68
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,509
you guys set it up...
rooms... cameras.

69
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:02,075
Everybody work together,
we're gonna get going faster.

70
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,775
Right in here? Do, do you think
if I brought in some coffee...

71
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,511
Why don't you ask him?

72
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:20,124
Stephanie, my name is Elizabeth...

73
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:24,931
and we're gonna try and talk
about what happened, okay?

74
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,802
And it's gonna help you feel better.

75
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,208
- You F.B.I.?
- Yeah... yeah...

76
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,472
You gonna bust me?

77
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:36,876
For now, no. No.

78
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:43,784
The only role is in how it affected
your perception of the events.

79
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:47,355
I know what I saw.

80
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,259
So whatcha got there, Stephanie?
A video game?

81
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,031
You like playing games?

82
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:04,740
So...

83
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:09,843
There's a pair of pants under
that skirt, huh?

84
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,350
You know the equipment
she was talking about?

85
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,016
- It's in the trunk of my car.
- I'm on it!

86
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:26,228
Actually it's quite a bit of equipment,
Captain, so... maybe...

87
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,664
Degrasso. Give Wright a hand.

88
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:32,565
C'mon now.

89
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,513
Agent,
can I ask you a question?

90
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,380
It's just procedure.

91
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,954
I like to separate'em, put'em on tape.

92
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,492
I know one of your officers
is in there, but...

93
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:59,764
there's only one way to unfold
a note, so to speak...

94
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:00,856
without tearing the paper.

95
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,266
Yeah that's what I figured.

96
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,129
So let's look and see what we're...

97
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,900
Well that's not what I wanted
to ask you.

98
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,277
You got a cigarette?

99
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,844
No, sorry.

100
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:57,081
Stephanie?
We're gonna talk, right?

101
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,523
- I want to go home.
- I know you do, Stephanie.

102
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:03,056
I know.

103
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,065
Are you fucking kidding me?

104
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,539
Janet! Could you get us
a light in here?

105
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,510
It is fucking dark in here.
There's no light!

106
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:38,286
- Right... Yeah, these were...
- These shouldn't be here, take'em down.

107
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,528
Yeah. You guys give me
a hand when you're done?

108
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,010
Do you have some crayons in your bag?

109
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:03,911
They were in the car.

110
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,553
I have some crayons in the office.

111
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,883
Oh, great.
Could you get those, Janet?

112
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,292
Yeah. And some paper...

113
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:15,058
and I think I'm gonna bring
back some more marshmallows, okay?

114
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:27,668
Stephanie? So while we're talking you
could do some drawing for me, yeah?

115
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,743
- I gotta go to the bathroom.
- Okay. In a minute.

116
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,921
That agent lady, you know,
she wants these for the little girl.

117
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,794
Crayons?

118
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:50,302
Those F.B.I. Agents think of things
no beat cop ever would.

119
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,230
What is the matter?
What, are you two years old?

120
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,654
So you know, right?

121
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:14,055
I'm sorry?

122
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,727
These two...

123
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,962
fucking... masked fuckers...

124
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:21,624            
Officer?

125
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:25,030
I know you've been through
a really rough time...

126
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,897
but let's work towards making this
a safe space.

127
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,006
I'm gonna ask you to watch
your language.

128
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,841
I really have
to use the bathroom...

129
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,410
Okay, Bobbi, you can go.
Go on.

130
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:44,853
Hi.

131
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,525
Use the toilet.

132
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,095
So how we doing?

133
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:02,842
We're all just fucking swell Mr. F.B.I.

134
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,037
Officer Bennett?
Agent Hallaway.

135
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,679
I gather you two...

136
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,944
swooped into town all suited
up to finish what I started?

137
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:16,284
I see the tensions between our
departments are alive and well.

138
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:20,189
My partner and I, we have many months
invested in this case...

139
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,522
My partner invested his life
in this case.

140
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,033
His and your involvement in
these incidents will not go...

141
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,468
uncredited.

142
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:35,907
The hand... how are you doing?

143
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,876
Like I said...
'we're all just fucking swell'.

144
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,815
Next time
you need to pee...

145
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,821
someone goes with you.

146
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,358
- I'm a witness, not a suspect.
- I know what you are.

147
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,758
And I also know how to pervert
a cavity search.

148
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,298
Wow, I haven't done a girl
since art school.

149
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:00,959
It's just like riding a bike.

150
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:02,968
Yes, Ma'am.

151
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:07,999
Okay, girls, we'll do the interviews
separately, so...

152
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,005
Janet and the officers
will show you where to go.

153
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,878
Jack...

154
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,790
Sam... Go easy.

155
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,860
- Easy?
- Yeah. Remember why we're here.

156
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:39,034
I remember
why we're here... Agent.

157
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:41,706
I'm good.

158
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,076
Real good.

159
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,625
Janet worked the mushroom lamp
for the ambience.

160
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,626
Really livens the place up, doesn't it?

161
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,606
It's alright, sweetheart.
It's just a camera.

162
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:33,388
FBI man...

163
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:37,656
Can we please have Officer Bennett
take his seat at the table, please?

164
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,060
C'mon Jack.
Take a seat in the chair.

165
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,873
Everyone? We're gonna
be starting with yesterday morning.

166
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,285
Jim and I...

167
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,413
were having coffee...

168
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,514
Richard Ramirez.

169
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,758
Jeff 'Hungry-Man' Dahmer...

170
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,860
- Oh. Died in prison!
- Amen, buddy.

171
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,024
Yeah. That'll teach you to sweep.

172
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,469
John Wayne Gacy.

173
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,698
Fucking Manson Family.

174
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,871
- We'll get ours...
- Yeah...

175
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,217
I'm still kinda drunk.

176
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:44,489
I do so love the ladies.

177
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:57,740
We pulled the driver over...

178
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:03,506
He said he'd been
delivering groceries on Camrose...

179
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,681
Said he'd seen something.

180
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:09,945
Something terrible.

181
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,301
Wasn't like you'd think.

182
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:36,779
So Johnny and I drove all this
way to see this guy about a job...

183
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,366
What's up, "Bucket"?

184
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,897
Mister Horns?

185
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,673
- What's going on?
- Hey. Have a seat.

186
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,504
- Who's your friend?
- This is Bobbi.

187
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,109
- Hey.
- Hi.

188
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,803
Yeah, I am...

189
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,409
Speaking of...
can I get the usual?

190
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,787
And... we had our interview.

191
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:26,757
You want a drink?

192
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:30,295
Got some leftovers in the refrigerator.

193
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,234
God no, we've actually, we gotta
get going. So...

194
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,641
we'll see you later.

195
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:39,668
Just a sec.

196
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,511
Bucket... you alright?

197
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,046
Raise your hands above your head...

198
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:52,891
not you.

199
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,620
Jesus Christ...

200
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,361
Bucket!

201
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,573
Oh shit.

202
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:20,813
The interview
ended pretty abruptly.

203
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,051
Whatever doesn't fit
in your pockets, goes in my purse.

204
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:23,780
Got it.

205
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,258
Shit. Get the lighter. Lighter.
Get the pipes.

206
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,962
Thank you. Thank you very much.

207
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,069
Well, I'll talk to you soon.

208
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:39,596
C'mon.

209
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:42,805
See you!

210
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,640
We were pretty sure
we didn't get the job.

211
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,939
Wait, wait, wait...

212
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,542
You mean he didn't just
hire you on the spot?

213
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:54,620
Oh. No. We weren't
interviewing to be cops.

214
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,383
Alright, alright. Let's go on.

215
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,087
That's it. We left.

216
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,851
He took four days off of work,
plus a weekend...

217
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,254
so we could have a vacation.

218
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,918
- Everybody doing okay?
- Yep.

219
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,090
I think you wear this 'father'
thing pretty well.

220
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,231
- Well with these kids, it's easy.
- Thank you.

221
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:49,934
My mother kept saying over and over
what a nice thing it was for him to do.

222
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,375
It's good for people
to get away sometimes.

223
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:58,405
I guess. But I liked
where I was to begin with.

224
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,880
Look what I drew.

225
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:09,292
Oh! Look at that! Oh, honey.

226
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,864
- You are so talented.
- Thank you.

227
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,033
It's great... the ants.

228
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,103
- No, honey, they're bears.
- The bears.

229
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,071
- Beavers.
- The beavers.

230
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,009
Officer Bennett?

231
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:26,908
Yeah.

232
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:34,350
Yeah. You and your partner were first
on the scene, am I correct about that?

233
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:39,887
That's correct. Right after
the grocery delivery man.

234
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,183
If you could continue, Officer Bennett?

235
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:45,689
Keep going.

236
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:52,502
The guys from 'Crime-Scene' showed
and we left.

237
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,744
What are you thinking?

238
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:11,720
She's good-looking.

239
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:20,058
He used to be, too.

240
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,961
So we're driving along...

241
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:30,074
Good girl!

242
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:33,336
Yes!

243
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:55,967
That is some good shit.

244
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,663
- Ok, ok, c'mon!
- Shit! Sorry, I forgot who's driving!

245
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:09,037
Who am I?

246
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:16,786
Ok.

247
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:23,959
Let's see...

248
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:28,066
we stopped.
To stretch.

249
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:30,899
That's good. Stretching.
It's good.

250
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:36,635
And that's when we first
saw the little girl, Stephanie.

251
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,309
Stop! Seriously!
God Damn it, stop!

252
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:40,844
Why, do you have to pee?

253
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,643
Don't act like an asshole.
There's a family.

254
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,512
Hey, it's the elephant
at the rest stop nobody talks about.

255
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,313
Oh, ok, 'Bill W.'
Oh. Hello.

256
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,792
Where a grisly discovery
was made.

257
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:30,996
Police feel certain that
this is the work of the two suspects...

258
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:34,488
who have left a series of victims
across the country.

259
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:37,535
A press conference is scheduled
for later this afternoon...

260
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:40,503
after further examination
of the scene...

261
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,699
and the body discovered inside.

262
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:47,112
Police urge all citizens of the area
to keep their doors locked...

263
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:50,949
and to immediately report any activities
that appear out of the normal...

264
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:54,908
as well as any sightings of the missing
woman, Elaine Meyer, pictured here.

265
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,291
I'm not allowed to watch
the news at home.

266
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,896
Some things children
shouldn't see.

267
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,872
That's what my Mom says...
I mean...

268
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:52,974
Said.

269
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,971
I'm so sorry, Stephanie.

270
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,288
That poor little girl.

271
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,327
Children can be very resilient.

272
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:15,555
I think it's a shame making
her re-live all those things...

273
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:21,396
No, I mean, I know, of course
you're just doing your job, I know that...

274
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,031
it's just, you have to do this, right?

275
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:26,570
I have to know what they've seen.

276
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,347
Every detail, right?

277
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:32,147
Oh yeah... Every detail.

278
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,952
Oh God, I just...

279
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,750
You need the information
and speaking of...

280
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:45,456
It's the Coroner's report.

281
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:47,863
I'm 'friends' with the Coroner.

282
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:51,793
Yeah.

283
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:56,634
Well... thank you.

284
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:58,075
You're welcome.

285
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,317
No lab results?

286
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:18,828
No, no, he's rushing those...

287
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:21,559
but he said it's just going to take
him a long time to collect it all.

288
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:26,631
Did he say what he's collecting?
I mean, did he mention...

289
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:28,870
ballistics?

290
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:32,871
No. But you know he is big on hair
and fibers.

291
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:34,205
It's kind of his specialty.

292
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,476
Apparently they left a lot of that.

293
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:39,710
You know what I'm wondering?
Why would they be so sloppy?

294
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:46,854
- They're likely to improve.
- Of course. Yeah.

295
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,024
Unless, Ma'am...

296
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,758
They just don't give a shit.

297
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:02,840
Oh my God... what we do to each
other, huh?

298
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,415
What are you two doing in here?

299
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:18,545
The uh, the girl, Bobbi?
She had to piss.

300
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:22,426
Why don't you go and make
sure she gets back in the room?

301
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:25,322
- Go on now...
- Okay!

302
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,027
And why don't you go keep an eye on him.

303
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:41,869
Alright. Then?

304
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,216
We have areas we patrol.

305
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:55,553
Nice shot!
Look at him!

306
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:00,555
Alright.

307
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,897
Pick your fucking personality.

308
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:04,969
I get to pick?

309
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,234
I am clearly 'Good Cop.'

310
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,843
Thank you very much.

311
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:14,903
Friend to the people!
'Good Cop'!

312
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:16,844
We patrolled them.

313
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,855
I look forward
to working with you

314
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,966
Hello Officer, looks like
I had a tire blow...

315
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,867
That's what it looks like, huh?

316
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,306
I got a solid spare, so...

317
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:45,043
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you
to get back in the vehicle for the moment.

318
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,978
Is there a problem, Officer?

319
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:49,047
- Well, Sir...
- Keith.

320
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:51,538
Oh. Keith. Okay.
Hi.

321
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:57,117
There's no problem with me,
but you see my partner back there?

322
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,389
Yes Sir.
He looks upset.

323
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:02,956
Yeah. Well...

324
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:06,059
We got a couple of killers loose...

325
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,427
everyone's wound up pretty good about
it but Jack there...

326
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:09,898
he's wound especially tight.

327
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,663
We heard something about
that on the radio...

328
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,864
Oh no, it is worse than they're saying
on the radio. Trust me.

329
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,943
And Jack there is, like I said,
pretty wound up...

330
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:20,945
and we saw you guys coming
down the road...

331
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:24,278
and he swears that you
were pulling too much speed.

332
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:27,546
Oh, jeez, I wasn't speeding, Officer,
really I was going... not speeding...

333
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,814
No. No. No. Relax, Keith.
That's what I said.

334
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,049
You're 'preaching to the choir'.
That's what I told him.

335
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:34,959
- It was just a normal speed...
- Yeah, I know. I know. I told him.

336
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,790
And he didn't like it when I did.

337
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:40,294
Here he comes.
Act casual.

338
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:47,831
Get down on the fucking ground.

339
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,506
Get down on the fucking ground! Now!

340
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,875
Get down, Keith!

341
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,150
Whoa, whoa, whoa... Ma'am!
Please return to the vehicle.

342
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,516
- Keith, honey?
- Please don't shoot me!

343
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,746
- I'll be in the car, honey.
- Please Officers.

344
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,059
I'm going to ask you to get your
wallet and give it to my partner.

345
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,994
Keith, it's best to do what he says,
because when he gets like this...

346
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:15,999
it's just really crucial
that he feels like you're listening.

347
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,061
I'm listening...
Please don't shoot me, Officer!

348
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,366
We let him
go with a warning.

349
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,550
You know how people
get out here, Captain.

350
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,919
The way they start driving
in the desolate stretches...

351
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:47,356
like the race car drivers
they always wanted to be.

352
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:51,161
Speeding is the number one cause
of traffic fatalities, you know.

353
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,694
Not this week.

354
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:01,868
I'll be getting back to it now.

355
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,576
That's an excellent plan, Wright.

356
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:10,276
You getting coffee?

357
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,719
Light and sweet for me, there, Chief.

358
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:59,803
Something I can do for you, Degrasso?

359
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:04,134
Just enjoying your work.

360
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,877
How about you let
me enjoy some of yours?

361
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:11,941
Go on...

362
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,846
I think making him angry
is a really bad idea.

363
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:22,949
Oh, gee Mom...
tell Dad I'm real fucking sorry.

364
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:26,023
Hey.
An attitude change, please?

365
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,067
Is there any more hot chocolate?

366
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:35,797
Of course there is.
Can I keep this?

367
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:37,969
I drew it for you.

368
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,774
It's great.

369
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,439
I'll go get you that hot chocolate.
You'll be alright, on your own?

370
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:49,520
I'll be right back.

371
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:28,383
- Having fun?
- Yeah! Yeah...

372
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:33,528
This is what it's all about.

373
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:38,834
- Beautiful day.
-Yeah!

374
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:41,029
Yeah, it's perfect.

375
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:01,220
Hey...

376
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:08,989
I'll be damned...

377
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:11,864
Yeah, I thought it was pretty
amazing myself.

378
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:20,243
- She hasn't said much.
- Well, I'm working on it.

379
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:25,613
You're good with her.

380
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:32,786
Yeah. Well, I was once
a sad little girl myself.

381
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,823
Don't go getting emotionally involved...
that's not what this is about.

382
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:42,297
It's bringing up
a lot of stuff...

383
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:44,233
A lot of...

384
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,403
You can't save her...

385
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:56,745
I know.

386
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:30,537
Here you go.

387
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:32,477
Thank you.

388
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:35,917
Watch... it's kind of hot.

389
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,017
You like being a cop?

390
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,060
You like being a fuck-up?

391
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:47,289
Hey, Degrasso...

392
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,768
I don't like this... Lady.

393
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:53,898
Really? No?

394
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:56,306
Let's keep the pace, Officers.

395
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:01,537
Yeah. Let's... keep the pace.

396
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,181
You heard the Agent, Bobbi...
Chop! Chop!

397
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,912
So, we were just driving along...

398
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,445
- One for you...
- No, I don't want another one!

399
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:15,822
Do you want me to drive the car or do
you want me to go into cardiac arrest?

400
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,087
- Okay, one more.
- Okay.

401
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,958
I'm not doing another one, no way.
You do it.

402
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:24,160
You do it. You're doing it.
I'm not doing it.

403
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,965
I'll grab your fucking tits right now.
I swear to God I will.

404
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:30,496
Oh then I'm really not doing,
I'm done. I'm so not doing it.

405
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:31,540
Bring it on!

406
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,507
Promises, promises...

407
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:35,909
Oh, shit!

408
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,037
I'll do it...

409
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,817
- I love this song.
- You love every fucking song.

410
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:11,276
Mom! Mom, I saw something!

411
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,748
- Oh, now we're talking!
- Old school!

412
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:13,681
Mom!

413
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,350
Why can't I get just one kiss

414
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,957
Why can't I get just one Kiss

415
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,730
There may be something
That I wouldn't miss

416
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:30,526
But I look at your pants
And I need a kiss

417
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:32,994
Why can't I get just one screw

418
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:35,671
Watch the road!
Watch the road!

419
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:38,473
Believe me I know what to do

420
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:41,306
But something won't let me
Make love to you

421
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:49,948
See now this is music, David.

422
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,585
This is rock!
This rocks, baby.

423
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,817
Why can't I get just one fuck

424
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,056
Just one duck!

425
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,130
Cover your ears...

426
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:02,895
- You guys are great.
- One duck!

427
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,337
No one heard me.

428
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,552
People just weren't
themselves yesterday.

429
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:29,920
Finish up, Jim.
We got one.

430
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:34,287
What do you know...
Mother Fucker is speeding.

431
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:40,996
You gonna take that?

432
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:43,805
Guess.

433
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,244
Unbelievable!
That's supernatural.

434
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:56,581
I'm a little hard right now,
I gotta tell you.

435
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:20,039
Neat.

436
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:23,005
- So let's try it again.
- Well this is the real thing.

437
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,007
We stopped to help...

438
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,877
Shit! Fuck!

439
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,385
I almost just had a heart attack.

440
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:42,327
Like this. So close.

441
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:45,433
That is close.

442
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:51,838
You should have seen Bobbi's face.
She was so scared.

443
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,841
I'll bet you were all scared.

444
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:59,314
Flats suck.

445
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:02,352
I don't wanna see anyone
else die today, please hon'?

446
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:04,751
No shit... God.

447
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:09,048
The lady is a fucking saint, right?

448
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:10,817
Yeah. She is.

449
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:14,462
We stopped. That's what matters.

450
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,968
We gave them a hand.
They were fucking stranded.

451
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:21,134
Oh God...

452
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,009
Where you going?

453
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:30,012
I was gonna go start the paperwork on
"Little Miss Shitty"'s Good Deed Award.

454
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,782
He needs a woman.

455
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:40,652
Me too.

456
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:49,028
Let's go do some bad.

457
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:55,038
It could have been a real mess,
Captain. I'm telling you.

458
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:56,897
Hello, dad.

459
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,941
Oh my God, his shirt says
"Mischief Sausage".

460
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,978
No, it does, look at it,
it says "Mischief Sausage".

461
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:05,515
- Whatever, man.
- Look at him!

462
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,943
- Oh my...
- Oh man...

463
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:15,791
Oh we're fucked.

464
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:18,885
- Oh my God.
- Fuck.

465
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:22,563
Fuck, fuck, fuck...

466
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:24,657
Hand out of nose!
Finger out of nose!

467
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:31,069
Want another one?

468
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,838
Just keep it real.
Seriously. Don't look back.

469
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,676
- Want another one?
- Don't look back!

470
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:42,143
It's okay, Officer,
it's a flat. That's all.

471
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:51,284
Listen up, folks. Get back inside
your vehicle and leave the engine off.

472
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,393
We're going to fuck in the clink.
You know it.

473
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:02,835
You're doing great, sweetheart,
I know it's not easy.

474
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,739
I don't know honey...
it's probably procedural.

475
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:10,377
Officer...
Hi. Fine.

476
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:14,942
What are they doing?
Don't look back!

477
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:17,446
- I'm not!
- What are they doing?

478
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,287
- How would I know if I can't look back?
- Just shut up!

479
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:23,827
Fuck. Now the charge is dying.
Great.

480
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,351
David, watch your language.

481
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:27,363
Do I got shit up my nose?
Do I got chunks?

482
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:29,889
Do I? No, look!

483
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:37,063
- Dad?
- It's okay, honey. Just sit tight.

484
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:38,805
I saw something...

485
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,303
Well I see something too, Bean.

486
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:43,073
Honey pass me the insurance
and registration will you?

487
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:47,979
I'll take the Station Wagon, you take
the Duster, and then we'll switch.

488
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:49,542
Oh, dig it. Alright.

489
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:57,294
I can't fucking believe this!

490
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:58,761
Watch your language, Mom.

491
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:00,964
Alright. You really wanna
poke the bear, David?

492
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:02,022
Okay settle down!

493
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:11,866
Where the hell is he?

494
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:13,406
Oh shit!

495
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:16,811
- Hi.
- Hi.

496
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:18,779
- How ya doing?
- Good.

497
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:21,574
- Kinda snuck up on ya, didn't I?
- You did!

498
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:23,881
You know, you were pulling
a pretty big number.

499
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:27,121
I'm sorry, you know, I just...
I didn't even notice.

500
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:29,516
You guys were driving pretty fast.

501
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:32,793
She's pretty. But we weren't
driving fast.

502
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,329
Oh... come on.

503
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,567
I'm soft when it comes
to the speed limit.

504
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:41,402
I grew up here... pulled a few
race car moves out here myself.

505
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,903
We're awfully sorry, Officer.

506
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,898
Yeah I got that, and I understand.

507
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:49,971
See, there is one issue, though.
My partner.

508
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,178
You're timing's bad because my partner...

509
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:56,377
last year he lost his family
in a traffic incident like this.

510
00:45:56,453 --> 00:46:01,186
He lost his wife and son
to a speeding collision. It was horrible!

511
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:04,116
He had a wife. Had a couple o' kids.

512
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:08,361
And now he goes home
and he eats a TV dinner.

513
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:13,467
And you can't imagine
the depth of grief.

514
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:14,829
No.

515
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:19,741
He wept in a fetal position
for over a year. I held him tight.

516
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:23,112
Oh, it's hysterical, isn't it?

517
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:25,740
- No. It's not.
- Yeah. Give me your fucking wallet.

518
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:27,849
My I. D?

519
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:31,820
No. I'll, I'll need your wallet.
We've moved past I.D. To wallet.

520
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,517
I'll need your wallet as well.

521
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:41,328
- Yeah. Okay.
- I'll be right back.

522
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:48,199
Thank you. You know what they say
about guys who drive red cars?

523
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:49,228
No.

524
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:54,172
- I'll be back in a minute, alright?
- Okay.

525
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:03,444
They don't say that about guys
who drive red cars...

526
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,356
Bad news.
Speeder killed your family.

527
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:10,290
- Yours, too.
- Hey, single again.

528
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:14,022
Those kids are high. You know,
you might wanna search the car.

529
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:17,125
- You smell money?
- No... just beer.

530
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:18,394
Aw fuck it, then.

531
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:23,034
Check out the Mom. She looks
like that skirt from Wood Shop.

532
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,129
Oh! Alright...

533
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:32,777
- Shit.
- What?

534
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:35,615
Don't worry about it.

535
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:37,783
- Here comes my party.
- Great...

536
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:40,483
Where's the fucking fire?

537
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:42,753
Fucker...

538
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,796
Shut up!

539
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:48,356
Oh 'hey' what?
Get your fucking ass on the ground.

540
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:52,466
Alright. Now you
be real fucking quiet...

541
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,937
or else I'm gonna blow
you a new shitter. You understand?

542
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:01,711
Oh fuck...

543
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:05,578
Put your hands on the wheel.

544
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:09,476
Look at him.

545
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,221
Tell your junkie boyfriend...

546
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:19,260
tell him you don't love him.

547
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,365
- I don't love you.
- Mean it.

548
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:25,935
I don't love you.

549
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:28,335
- Fucking mean it!
- I don't love you!

550
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,939
He drive like
this all the time?

551
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:41,449
No, no, never, I swear...

552
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:44,783
Aw, you're protecting him.
That's sweet. I get it.

553
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:52,161
- You settled, didn't ya?
- What?

554
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:57,494
I mean, you know, you get scared.
I get it.

555
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:00,528
Say...

556
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:04,000
'I hate you'.

557
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:06,831
I hate you.

558
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:09,240
Fucking mean it!

559
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:11,178
- I hate you!
- Mean it!

560
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:13,216
I hate you! Fuck...

561
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,448
Look the other fucking way.

562
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,726
Alright. C'mon. Gimme
a little sugar.

563
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,561
C'mon. Gimme a little bit.
It's okay.

564
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,345
Don't cry. It's okay.

565
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:47,577
You're gonna be alright.

566
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,219
Eesh... what a day!

567
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:02,861
You don't fucking move. And you get
your fucking ass outta the car, whore!

568
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:12,238
It's beautiful out here, huh?

569
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:17,539
Sometimes I come out here just to think.
You know, get my head straight.

570
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:31,155
You know, we're in this sad predicament
because you drive too fucking fast.

571
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:33,457
Right?

572
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:39,028
Now, I'm cool... but I'm fair.

573
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:40,933
Right?

574
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:42,997
So we'll let it go.

575
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:50,105
You smell good!
What is that?

576
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:52,280
Louder.

577
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,277
Fifty-five saves lives.

578
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:58,685
Okay calm down.

579
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:01,791
Now we're gonna do one last thing,
just so I'm the boss guy, right?

580
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:03,792
I want you to put this right
in your fucking mouth...

581
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:08,026
C'mon, open your mouth.
Fucking open up your mouth.

582
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:12,593
Open up your fucking mouth!
Do it. Do it.

583
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:14,226
Now slap me in the face.

584
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:26,346
When you get back in that car, you're
going to drive at a safe speed, right?

585
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:27,918
Okay.

586
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,910
I'm all about safety.
That's how I do it.

587
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:32,318
- Okay.
- Okay.

588
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:35,083
Now I bet the kids are
a little worried, right?

589
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:38,291
So let's make a 'snow angel'
right now, go ahead.

590
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:43,093
Snow Angel!
C'mon. You and me. Snow Angel?

591
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:44,998
No! Fuck...

592
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:48,665
Get back in the car.

593
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:06,754
Don't!

594
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:14,523
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Fuck...

595
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:23,271
I didn't mean it,
you know that, right?

596
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:28,172
Look at him, even high
in his driver's license picture.

597
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:32,473
They'll be gone in a few minutes.
It's almost over.

598
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:35,247
- Steph just got out of the car!
- Oh shit!

599
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,290
Get back in the car, sir!

600
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:49,023
My Mom said you'd be gone
in a few minutes.

601
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:52,869
Well yeah... in a few minutes.

602
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:57,336
I tried to tell my parents but
the music was too loud.

603
00:52:57,874 --> 00:52:59,068
Tried to tell them what?

604
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:03,170
- I saw something bad...
- What did you see?

605
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:06,144
There was a white car and a blue car.

606
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:09,412
And the blue car had smashed-up
windows and blood all over it.

607
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:14,023
- You been watching scary movies?
- My Mom doesn't let me.

608
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:20,121
Alright. Thank you for telling us that.
And we are gonna take care of that okay?

609
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:25,760
How about you and me go back to your car?
Your dad looks worried.

610
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,401
I know what blood looks like.

611
00:53:58,134 --> 00:54:00,102
Your daughter's a brave little girl.

612
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:01,231
Good news.

613
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:05,201
We won't be ticketing you for speeding.
Alright? I took care of that.

614
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,509
You know,
I could report your partner.

615
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,307
But he won't!

616
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:14,012
I would just let this go, Sir.
With my apologies.

617
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:16,013
You know, I don't know what
you said to him...

618
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:20,386
but it really did the trick, because
he is grinning like a monkey!

619
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:22,049
You folks got
a good spare in the trunk?

620
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:26,056
We sure do, Officer.
We'll be just fine.

621
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:29,560
So thank you for that, 'cause I gotta 
ride with him all day.

622
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:30,496
Well here you go.

623
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:32,991
You all have a great day, alright?

624
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:37,471
Alright. Take care.

625
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:42,877
Fucking asshole.

626
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:03,161
Steph...

627
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:05,297
honey...

628
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:08,736
what did you say to the Police Officers?

629
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:13,040
I told them I saw something.
You weren't listening.

630
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:17,975
You could have really gotten
your father in trouble...

631
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,474
He's not my father.

632
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:28,790
You know what I meant.

633
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:32,793
Fuck.
Mom, 'are we there yet? '

634
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:35,628
Alright. Thin ice, David.

635
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:41,930
Wanna do another one?

636
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:48,009
Yes. I do.

637
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:54,146
Stephanie, where is your father?
We should contact him.

638
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:57,709
My father's dead.

639
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:07,020
- Soccer Mom's thirsty.
- Bring her a beer.

640
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:13,759
I'm fine, I'll be out
in a minute, okay?

641
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:15,767
Okay.

642
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:23,939
- Here ya go.
- Thanks.

643
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,408
Cheers!

644
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,216
How's the vacation going?

645
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:37,751
I'm not really having a very good time.

646
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:42,293
Okay...

647
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:44,765
I'm suing them.

648
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:47,893
- No you're not, Steven.
- I am suing them. That is unbelievable.

649
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:51,201
Steven, we're lucky to be alive.
They're all corrupt.

650
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:52,901
Yeah, no, yeah...

651
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:55,504
I mean, I was petrified!

652
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:58,670
I don't know if it's the uniform,
or the gun...

653
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:01,946
Hey Mom... maybe I'll be a cop.

654
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,014
David, grow up!

655
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:17,500
Problem?

656
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:20,993
Ah, this fucking...
take the wheel a second, would you?

657
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:22,269
Jesus...

658
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:24,974
show off.

659
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:26,941
- Damn it!
- Look at that.

660
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,102
Tight-ass pants.

661
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:30,510
What, do you have to feed
that thing mice?

662
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:31,443
Ridiculous. I'm serious.

663
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:33,880
- Baby fucking deer-fawn.
- Unbelievable...

664
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,410
It's like a puppet.

665
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:51,925
Ah... whatever.

666
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:55,496
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

667
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:57,301
This is a goddamn bullet hole!

668
00:57:58,174 --> 00:58:01,701
So you think Officers Bennett
and Conrad shot out that man's tire...

669
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:04,103
I don't know, I guess it could
have been a bullet.

670
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:06,239
Are you fucking stupid?

671
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:11,081
No, I'm telling you,
that's what the guy thought it was.

672
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,088
Well, the guy's a fucking asshole!

673
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:15,756
You're the man who'd know.

674
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,269
Are those... little floating dead people?

675
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,235
Yes.

676
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:59,262
Hey Sweetie, we're almost finished.

677
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:04,271
- I wanna go home.
- We're not going home, Sweetie!

678
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:08,904
We're, we're on vacation.
We're having a great goddamn time, okay?

679
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,079
We got blood!

680
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,167
Aw fuck.
They were right behind us.

681
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:34,766
You shot the tire out.

682
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:39,731
The girl told us about the cars.

683
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,509
She said there were two cars.

684
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,876
Yeah, well, you know what?
We're missing the white one.

685
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:47,475
And what happened to Keith,
or 'Candy Pants'?

686
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:51,111
You're describing the Taurus that
you pulled over earlier in the day?

687
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:56,489
My partner and I pulled that Taurus
over earlier, yes.

688
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,421
They were speeding,
blew a tire...

689
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:06,599
And then you, the two of you, left the
scene with the couple alive and well.

690
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:10,499
Is that your statement?

691
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:18,480
I see what you're doing, Agent.

692
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:22,510
So then it was just moments after
you left...

693
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:26,419
that the unknown killers came and took
advantage of the couple's predicament?

694
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:36,490
Fine. That's your statement.
Keep going.

695
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:43,799
Hey, it's his job to shake all our
trees and see what falls out, huh?

696
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:49,573
Fuck him.

697
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:55,881
- A van just passed us.
- A white van.

698
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:09,321
I didn't warn my stepfather
about the van.

699
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:18,897
No one blames you, Stephanie.
I don't blame you.

700
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:25,914
Even if you didn't
tell him on purpose.

701
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:58,542
Stephanie, where are you going?

702
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:03,886
Stephanie!

703
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:30,903
David?
David!

704
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:37,279
Mom?

705
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:39,651
I got you.

706
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:40,917
Mom!

707
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:47,489
I got you. I've got you.
I got you.

708
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:55,666
Hey fuck face! You just
killed my best fucking friend!

709
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,865
Get out! Get out!

710
01:02:58,641 --> 01:02:59,699
What the fuck is your problem?

711
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:02,769
Oh shit. Shit!

712
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:07,439
You alright?

713
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:09,542
Wait, lady, I'm coming.
I'm coming!

714
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:16,281
I think it's the missing woman.
In here!

715
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:17,985
Stay right there!

716
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:20,895
Hold on, I'll be, I'll be right there.

717
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:26,058
Get off the van!

718
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:27,731
Okay, one second.

719
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,270
- Back up, Mom.
- Fuck!

720
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:33,873
Shit!

721
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:38,438
- Hey, get away from the van crack-head!
- Fuck you.

722
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:40,448
Aw, Jesus, Jack...
where are our fucking guys?

723
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:41,984
Fuck! Damn it.

724
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:45,654
Hey, get outta the way.

725
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:48,751
Hang tight, ma'am!

726
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:02,028
Aw fuck! I could've killed you!

727
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,160
I'm doing my job!

728
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:05,867
Go get that woman outta there.
I'll check around.

729
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:07,442
- Alright, pretty fucking great huh?
- Yeah...

730
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:11,408
Police officers!

731
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:25,550
His hands...
were taped to the wheel.

732
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:28,460
The guy from the Taurus.

733
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:34,063
And his head came up...

734
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:50,148
You're saying Bennett just dove in?

735
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:52,811
Minus one good hand, yeah.

736
01:04:53,689 --> 01:04:54,781
Cool.

737
01:04:57,593 --> 01:05:00,926
Fuck!
Mother fucker!

738
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:04,433
Get to the back!
Get to the back, Jim!

739
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,028
- Fuck!
- Shut up!

740
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:10,567
Fuck!

741
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:14,741
This is my fucking shooting
hand, Keith! Fuck!

742
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:16,976
God damn it!

743
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:25,611
It was like a fucking building
had just dropped on me.

744
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:30,248
Wait a minute... she... on top of you?

745
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:34,558
Jesus, lady!

746
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:37,463
It's not her!

747
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:41,165
And I can, I can hear Bobbi
yelling that it wasn't the woman, and...

748
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,330
Hostage is a suspect!

749
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,908
So the mom and the kid just go down.

750
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:56,008
It's fucked up.

751
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,082
Hey little girl! Come here.

752
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:05,956
Quick, quick, come here,
we're gonna hide...

753
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:08,363
c'mon okay get in get in,
head down, head down, head down...

754
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:13,693
And I was almost out the back doors...

755
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,503
Jack.

756
01:06:28,884 --> 01:06:30,442
Jim took a bullet.

757
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:35,584
I went to him...

758
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:41,357
No! Oh shit.
Oh fuck.

759
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:45,499
Oh. No. Jim.

760
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:50,637
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

761
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:55,806
Oh shit. Oh shit. No.

762
01:06:58,047 --> 01:07:01,175
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

763
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:05,478
One of them clocked me from behind.

764
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:10,925
I know you're keeping
a secret, buddy.

765
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:19,527
Oh yeah.

766
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:23,968
I have to go to the bathroom.

767
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:30,710
I can go alone.
I'm almost nine.

768
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:34,039
Alright, you can go.

769
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:42,752
Hey, you.

770
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:49,329
Get going...

771
01:08:25,968 --> 01:08:27,401
Yeah, you should see it, it's amazing.

772
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,239
They're just so good at what they do.

773
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:35,876
I'm sad, of course...
the little girl.

774
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:38,237
But it's exciting.

775
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:41,308
Everyone's so nice, yeah.

776
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:45,978
I just want to be here
in case anyone needs anything.

777
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:00,797
I'll keep what
you said in mind.

778
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:05,000
Yeah. I'll do the same.

779
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:09,172
C'mon.

780
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:21,915
Housekeeping!

781
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:53,720
Ok what is it? Blue?
Blue Dove?

782
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:55,017
Ok. Blue Dove Motel.

783
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:58,059
3 bodies? Oh my God.

784
01:09:58,827 --> 01:10:02,524
Two men. One woman.
Right. Right.

785
01:10:02,598 --> 01:10:04,896
And then... okay.
Less than...

786
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:07,765
24 hours, okay.

787
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:11,205
I'll give it to the Captain
right away. Bye.

788
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:17,378
There goes my dinner date.

789
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:20,006
Janet. I'll take that.

790
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:23,916
Great.
I'd better deal with this.

791
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:32,855
Ladies and Gentlemen...

792
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:37,025
Why don't you go ahead and stretch
your legs and we'll meet in the corridor?

793
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:39,933
There's been a development.

794
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:46,034
Agent Anderson, I'll need to speak
to you before I update the others.

795
01:10:50,312 --> 01:10:52,473
- Ah, this is unfortunate.
- Yeah... boy...

796
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:57,511
You like that man
you work with.

797
01:10:58,387 --> 01:10:59,479
Agent Hallaway?

798
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:01,980
You called him 'Sam'.

799
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:04,450
I did?

800
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:06,552
Well...

801
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:09,797
we've worked together
for a long time.

802
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:14,802
That's the way my Mom looked
at my stepfather...

803
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:16,337
before they were married.

804
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:20,600
They thought it was a secret.
But it wasn't. I knew.

805
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,088
Captain?

806
01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:35,520
Yeah, I'll have
everyone sit tight.

807
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:41,353
Here you go, Agent.

808
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:55,577
You gonna tell us
what's happening?

809
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:59,102
Apparently a maid has discovered
bodies at The Blue Dove Motel.

810
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:00,710
Who's going?

811
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:04,883
I'm gonna take Wright and Degrasso,
see if it's relevant to the case.

812
01:12:05,387 --> 01:12:06,319
Get your stuff.

813
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:09,657
What's going to happen now?

814
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:12,752
I'm going to have to go someplace, okay?

815
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:17,157
- You're gonna stay in here with me.
- We can finish this later.

816
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:19,860
No, we're gonna finish it now,
I have some questions for you.

817
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:22,263
Just do as you're told and everything
will be okay.

818
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:33,882
Ladies, I have some questions for you so
if you could step inside, please?

819
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:36,476
- Come on, Jack
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

820
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:39,788
Where's Janet?

821
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:43,091
- She's talking to the Coroner.
- Well, that could take awhile.

822
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:44,357
C'mon.

823
01:12:50,632 --> 01:12:51,530
Shotgun!

824
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:57,635
- You're gonna be riding in the back.
- Yeah, I'll do that.

825
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:04,344
Nice work, Degrasso.
Pick it up...

826
01:13:04,913 --> 01:13:06,014
Busted.

827
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:07,572
Fuck you, teacher's pet.

828
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:12,879
Ah, shit, buddy!

829
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:20,257
Would you just sit down?
You're driving me fucking crazy.

830
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:22,492
You gotta stay here.
Fuck you!

831
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:25,333
C'mon Jack... take a load off.

832
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:38,403
I'm gonna be in there in a minute,
Stephanie, go on.

833
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:39,777
I don't want to be in there.

834
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:43,917
Look. It's almost over, kid.
It's almost over.

835
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:46,510
Just let me tell you something, first.

836
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:55,827
What?

837
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:30,628
I figure with this under my belt...

838
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:32,894
pretty good candidate
for any job I want

839
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:37,329
My mother's gonna
shit herself with pride.

840
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:41,038
- She'll be real proud of you.
- I hope so...

841
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:47,877
Well...

842
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:50,882
okay...

843
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:53,077
Give me your piece, Bennett.

844
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:58,920
I need you to give
me your gun, Officer.

845
01:14:59,628 --> 01:15:01,721
Fuck you, you need my fucking gun.

846
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:06,594
I need the Officer
to give me his weapon... now.

847
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:09,703
Give him your weapon, Jack.

848
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:11,762
I'll give it back to you
after I finish talking.

849
01:15:13,408 --> 01:15:15,205
This is fucking bullshit.

850
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:19,303
- It's crazy bullshit.
- Really.

851
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:21,277
Not really...

852
01:15:23,385 --> 01:15:26,445
Alright. Why don't
you take a seat, Jack?

853
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:34,422
'Cause I wanna go back to the crash...

854
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:41,361
right, just before your partner was
allegedly, brutally murdered.

855
01:15:41,436 --> 01:15:43,802
Don't you fucking talk about my partner.

856
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:49,401
Hey. C'mon. I think it's gonna
feel good to get if off your chest.

857
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:53,308
Agent Hallway, look...
I'm a little confused.

858
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:55,876
You should be used
to that by now.

859
01:15:56,652 --> 01:16:00,247
Look, if there's any question
as to how Jim Conrad died...

860
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:05,853
There's no question here,
that our Officer Jack cannot answer.

861
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:11,693
None.
Isn't that right, Jack?

862
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:17,165
Hold that. Hold that thought...

863
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:21,039
because I think we all oughtta
have a smoke.

864
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:27,738
Let's all just have a smoke now, alright?

865
01:16:29,818 --> 01:16:32,252
Yeah. Missy?

866
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:34,146
No thank you.

867
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,017
- You never smoke?
- No...

868
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:44,232
Alright... I guess so.
Captain?

869
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:47,133
He quit.

870
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:50,000
Yeah but this is a special occasion.
C'mon.

871
01:16:52,307 --> 01:16:54,969
- You lied.
- Smoker's privilege.

872
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:57,835
You can quit after you had this one.

873
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:04,683
Yeah...

874
01:17:16,331 --> 01:17:18,697
Alright. Jack?

875
01:17:20,902 --> 01:17:22,028
Smoking kills.

876
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:24,464
No.

877
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:30,238
No. You do.

878
01:17:32,614 --> 01:17:34,605
You don't know what you're talking about.

879
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:37,875
- Don't I? Hmm?
- You weren't there.

880
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:39,148
Oh, wait.

881
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:43,053
I was there. Yeah.

882
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:49,360
Help...

883
01:17:57,606 --> 01:17:58,800
Surprise!

884
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:02,407
You were a little out of it 'cause
you had your hand opened up, and...

885
01:18:02,477 --> 01:18:03,569
Bobbi...

886
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:07,906
that was great, all that screaming stuff,
that set the whole deal up.

887
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:12,852
That was great, it was a lot of drama,
and then you were really good, too.

888
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:15,913
Really. You jumped right back
into the game.

889
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:18,824
You got a lot of gas in your tank,
don't you?

890
01:18:19,594 --> 01:18:21,255
Now I want you, I want you...

891
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:24,595
to take it from there, huh?

892
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:27,935
- Hmm?
- Fuck!

893
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:34,941
You think there's a medal
in this?

894
01:18:37,846 --> 01:18:40,212
I hope there is.
It'd be sweet...

895
01:18:55,897 --> 01:18:56,795
Fuck!

896
01:18:57,265 --> 01:19:01,531
You fired into your partner and you
opened him up like a can of soda.

897
01:19:13,615 --> 01:19:15,913
- Head rush, Captain?
- Yeah.

898
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:17,616
It'll pass.

899
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:20,455
Fuck!

900
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,202
Sit on the chair, missy.

901
01:19:44,913 --> 01:19:45,880
Thank you.

902
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:52,013
Jack... c'mon.
Let's go back.

903
01:19:53,922 --> 01:19:56,049
Okay?
What's that smell?

904
01:20:02,097 --> 01:20:03,724
Don't you hate that smell?

905
01:20:07,202 --> 01:20:08,760
Quite a smell.

906
01:20:20,115 --> 01:20:21,207
Oh yeah...

907
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:25,913
I gotta take this.

908
01:20:27,122 --> 01:20:27,884
Baby?

909
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:30,852
Are you smoking?

910
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:34,755
Wherever you are, I want you
to come back to me...

911
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:37,929
and bring the butter,
we're having toast.

912
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:39,295
Just the way you like it.

913
01:20:44,906 --> 01:20:45,736
Hello...

914
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:48,103
Fuck.

915
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:03,620
What was that?

916
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:07,493
Come here...

917
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:11,157
Come here.

918
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:18,062
Come here, come.

919
01:21:22,811 --> 01:21:24,642
I didn't hear that.
What was that you said?

920
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,843
I said she was way too
fuckable to be F.B.I.

921
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:32,780
There was something else.

922
01:21:37,325 --> 01:21:39,020
I said she smelled like you.

923
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:45,789
I like that, and I want you to tell
her that when she comes back in.

924
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:50,105
Okay. Let's get back
to where we were, alright?

925
01:21:50,105 --> 01:21:51,936
Come here.
You wanna hear this.

926
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:57,271
Let's go back.

927
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:02,307
Wanna go back to the point we
were talking about?

928
01:22:02,384 --> 01:22:03,942
'Cause this was my favorite
part of the day.

929
01:22:04,386 --> 01:22:06,377
You and your bitch can go fuck yourselves.

930
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:14,930
I know what you're looking at, we're
gonna deal with the gun later, alright?

931
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:17,455
It's fun now. Okay?

932
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:20,060
'Cause first of all, even though,
regrettably...

933
01:22:20,168 --> 01:22:25,367
the Captain here is unable to hear your
admission, that would've been perfect...

934
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:31,835
I want you now to admit that
you killed your own partner.

935
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:33,674
Fuck you.

936
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:37,016
No. That's not the right answer.

937
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:49,931
Bye, baby...

938
01:23:55,563 --> 01:23:57,155
You killed my partner.

939
01:23:58,933 --> 01:24:00,025
Oh, please.

940
01:24:00,902 --> 01:24:02,267
Jack, you okay?

941
01:24:04,272 --> 01:24:07,435
It's, it's not the missing woman,
it's one of the fucking killers!

942
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:10,310
- Jack!
- Hostage is a suspect!

943
01:24:17,252 --> 01:24:20,744
I may have orchestrated it
but they were your bullets.

944
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:23,284
This is kind of amazing.

945
01:24:23,358 --> 01:24:25,792
Fuck you, you
fucking drug-addict whore.

946
01:24:26,094 --> 01:24:30,155
Hey, no, she's impressed!
The little girl was impressed, too.

947
01:24:33,468 --> 01:24:37,461
No! No! No! No! No!

948
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:40,530
I'm not...

949
01:24:40,608 --> 01:24:44,066
having a very good time.

950
01:24:51,886 --> 01:24:54,218
It's hard to impress children with
that shit...

951
01:24:54,289 --> 01:24:58,851
they get all slobbery and uncontrolled
but she didn't go that way.

952
01:25:01,129 --> 01:25:03,723
But you, hey, Missy...

953
01:25:04,332 --> 01:25:09,031
are you fucking soft or something?
C'mon, she's gone... she's gone.

954
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:14,033
You were gonna say something,
go ahead, spit it out, please.

955
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:16,240
I'm a good cop!

956
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:21,271
Oh... that's a total oxymoron.

957
01:25:22,884 --> 01:25:26,581
And remember, I was there.
When you realized what you'd done.

958
01:25:28,923 --> 01:25:30,091
Oh fuck... fuck...

959
01:25:30,091 --> 01:25:31,888
You went all 'crazy cop'.

960
01:25:36,764 --> 01:25:38,857
You started shooting at everything.

961
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:46,540
And, of course, you fired at my girl.

962
01:25:53,548 --> 01:25:54,845
Fuck...

963
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:58,475
I wish I hadn't missed.

964
01:26:02,724 --> 01:26:03,486
Oh shit!

965
01:26:24,879 --> 01:26:29,441
Well that's the second time I've knocked
him out. You'd think he'd see me coming.

966
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:35,384
But he's still with the party.
Good.

967
01:26:40,495 --> 01:26:43,055
- You want a little nap, too?
- No...

968
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:15,854
Right. Yes, go ahead.

969
01:27:16,864 --> 01:27:18,263
You ever let anyone go?

970
01:27:20,368 --> 01:27:23,496
You probably read the end
of a book first, don't you?

971
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:24,967
Yeah.

972
01:27:28,509 --> 01:27:29,976
That is no way to live.

973
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:36,879
Honey... I'm home.

974
01:27:39,854 --> 01:27:41,481
Hey. Come on, baby, come on.

975
01:27:44,392 --> 01:27:45,256
Oh yeah.

976
01:27:49,397 --> 01:27:51,831
- How was I?
- How were you?

977
01:27:55,536 --> 01:27:57,470
We know your ears work.

978
01:27:57,905 --> 01:28:00,066
How the fuck was I?
Was I scary?

979
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:05,077
- Will flattery save my life?
- Don't be stupid.

980
01:28:07,749 --> 01:28:11,412
- How about a blowjob?
- Answer me.

981
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:16,022
You were scary as shit, hey man...
just the whole thing was amaz...

982
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,428
I just wish I could tell people.

983
01:28:23,598 --> 01:28:25,190
Maybe in your next life.

984
01:28:29,337 --> 01:28:30,099
Baby!

985
01:28:40,915 --> 01:28:42,576
I fucking love you.

986
01:28:53,928 --> 01:28:55,862
Baby, we can start the party.

987
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:11,242
- Hey...
- Hey!

988
01:29:20,888 --> 01:29:25,621
God, look at you.
You smell so good.

989
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:27,919
You don't have to hurt me.

990
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:33,967
We're not hurting you.
We're loving you.

991
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:43,476
You're gonna fucking love this.

992
01:29:47,515 --> 01:29:50,780
She's so fucking pretty, Jesus.

993
01:29:52,086 --> 01:29:56,989
Look at these... they're nice.

994
01:29:58,059 --> 01:29:59,253
Do you like these?

995
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:02,154
Do you like them?

996
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:16,771
Would you touch my tits?

997
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:28,782
Oh, God... that's right.

998
01:30:30,858 --> 01:30:35,318
Yeah, c'mon, that's right.
Oh God, you're...

999
01:30:36,531 --> 01:30:41,093
Just let it go, it's okay,
just let it go.

1000
01:30:45,106 --> 01:30:46,300
She's ready!

1001
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:56,947
Oh yeah, baby.

1002
01:31:26,581 --> 01:31:27,548
Surprise!

1003
01:31:30,718 --> 01:31:31,844
Oh I love a...

1004
01:31:46,901 --> 01:31:48,835
I always wanted to be blonde.

1005
01:31:52,874 --> 01:31:54,239
C'mon, we gotta ride...

1006
01:31:58,546 --> 01:32:01,572
Yeah, hey, it's Ralph,
I'm still at The Blue Dove.

1007
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:05,250
I've identified the missing woman,
Elaine Meyer.

1008
01:32:05,786 --> 01:32:07,720
But I'm looking at some F.B.I. Badges.

1009
01:32:08,656 --> 01:32:11,819
How many Agents are we supposed
to have in town right now?

1010
01:32:20,935 --> 01:32:22,800
Are you hurting much, baby?

1011
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:26,898
No... just feel jabbed.

1012
01:32:38,019 --> 01:32:39,247
Hmm... stubborn.

1013
01:32:43,591 --> 01:32:45,252
I know who you are.

1014
01:32:57,805 --> 01:32:58,931
Baby...

1015
01:33:03,811 --> 01:33:05,870
Ah, she was on to us, so...

1016
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:10,440
I thought 'that's fun'.
Let her go free.

1017
01:33:13,487 --> 01:33:16,888
I think that's the most romantic
thing ever, in the whole world.

1018
01:33:18,326 --> 01:33:19,258
Oh baby...

1019
01:33:23,064 --> 01:33:24,463
Baby, oh...
