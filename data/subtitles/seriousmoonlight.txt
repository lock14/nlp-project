00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,469
# When we want to love,
we love #

2
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:16,765
# When we want
to kiss, we kiss #

3
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:19,810
# With a little petting #

4
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,396
# We're getting #

5
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:26,066
# Some fun out of life #

6
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:29,528
# When we want to work,
we work #

7
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:34,033
# When we want
to play, we play #

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,536
# In a happy setting #

9
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,122
# We're getting #

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,542
# Some fun out of life #

11
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:48,964
# Maybe we do
the right thing #

12
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:53,469
# Maybe we do wrong #

13
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,497
# Spending
each day #

14
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:59,600
# Wending
our way along #

15
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,770
# But when we
want to sing #

16
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,806
# We sing #

17
00:01:04,905 --> 00:01:09,026
# When we want to dance,
we dance #

18
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,987
# You can do your betting #

19
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,573
# We're getting #

20
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:18,160
# Some fun out of life #

21
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,596
# But when we want to sing #

22
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,591
# We sing #

23
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,644
# When we want to dance,
we dance #

24
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,939
# You can do your betting... #

25
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,676
Thank you.
- No problem, buddy.

26
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:53,153
# Some fun out of life. #

27
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,856
Michelle, I threw heck
to the wind

28
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,066
And drove up to the country
a day early.

29
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,694
I want to surprise Ian,
spend a long weekend with him.

30
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,754
So I need you to call Mettler.

31
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,033
Tell him his papers
were filed yesterday

32
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,617
and everything is fine.

33
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,995
I will talk to him first
thing on Monday morning.

34
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,581
Then call my dentist,
cancel that appointment.

35
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,374
Reschedule it for
Tuesday afternoon

36
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,585
and then cancel my meetings
for the rest of the day.

37
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,336
You know what to do.

38
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,047
That's why you
are my assistant.

39
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,882
Kiss kiss kiss.
- Is there anything else-

40
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,884
Hi, Louise.
- Hey, honey.

41
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,095
How's Chicago? Your flight leaves
in a couple of hours, right?

42
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,848
Can't wait to see you.
- Yeah. Yeah, me too.

43
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,900
Excuse me, Lou.

44
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:41,019
I'm just about to head
into a meeting.

45
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,731
I'll see you at the house
tomorrow, okay?

46
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,107
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

47
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,109
I'll be driving up
in the evening.

48
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,203
See you then.

49
00:02:50,302 --> 00:02:52,421
Bye.

50
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,222
Okay.

51
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,027
Ian's voice:
"Dearest Louise,

52
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:49,212
I am not spending the weekend
here as planned.

53
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,882
I've come to a crossroads
in our marriage

54
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,317
and I need to go away

55
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,165
and have some time
to think.

56
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,724
Sorry to do this
in a letter.

57
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,602
Please remember
to feed the fish. "

58
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,230
Please remember to
feed the fish?

59
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,332
No no no no.
I can't do- no.

60
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,410
Stupid.

61
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:15,003
Um...

62
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,131
"I'm very sorry.

63
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,676
You're wonderful

64
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,283
and I don't deserve you. "

65
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,792
Michelle, listen.
- I don't know what to say to him.

66
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:31,087
His purchase is going forward.
That's what you need to tell him

67
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,522
over and over again

68
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,341
until he calms down.

69
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,843
I think you
should call him.

70
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:41,023
No, I'm not gonna
call him myself, Michelle.

71
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,141
Michelle.
- Yeah?

72
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,893
There's someone
inside my house.

73
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,744
Oh.

74
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,898
Somebody quite romantic.

75
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,276
Listen, Michelle, no more calls
for the rest of the day.

76
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,445
I want you to hold all calls.
- Okay.

77
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,281
Looks like I'm about
to have a lot of sex.

78
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,284
Yup yup yup. Handle it yourself,
miss Harvard bachelorette.

79
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,660
That's what I pay
you to do.

80
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,860
Kiss kiss kiss.

81
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,931
Ian!

82
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,294
You came back early
to surprise me?

83
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,187
Ian?

84
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,234
Oh, look at these flowers.

85
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:25,102
They're just beautiful.
You haven't done this for me in years.

86
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:28,561
Business meeting
in Chicago, my ass.

87
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,498
Oh my God.

88
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,585
That is sexy.

89
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,563
Oh. Mm-mmm.

90
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,627
Yeah.

91
00:05:44,726 --> 00:05:46,671
Uh-oh. What's wrong?

92
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,997
Please sit down.

93
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,133
No.

94
00:05:50,232 --> 00:05:52,051
Please.
Please.

95
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,095
Oh.

96
00:05:54,194 --> 00:05:56,271
Oh, Ian.

97
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,691
Uh, Louise.
- This is so great.

98
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,235
Louise, I...

99
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,565
Oh.

100
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:08,851
I was in the middle
of writing it when you got here.

101
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,661
So it's- you're a day early.

102
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:16,069
You weren't supposed to
be here till tomorrow.

103
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,860
Please feed the fish?

104
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,529
I crossed that part out.

105
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,364
It wouldn't have made it
in the final letter at all.

106
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,826
What does this mean, Ian?
- Louise, I-

107
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,161
Why are you leaving?
What do you need to think about?

108
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,747
Why can't you think about it here?
- I'm going to Paris.

109
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,932
Paris?

110
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:35,378
Look, I've been having serious doubts
about this marriage.

111
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,047
And I think that-
- No, you're not going, Ian.

112
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:41,551
You're gonna stay right here
and we're going to work through this

113
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,594
together as we always
manage to do.

114
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,794
No, not this time.

115
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,908
Who is she?

116
00:06:57,007 --> 00:06:58,609
No, this isn't about
anybody else.

117
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,737
I mean, this is about you.
It's about me.

118
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,613
It's about us.
It's nobody else.

119
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,741
But there is someone else.
- No no.

120
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,868
Oh, you looked at your hand
when you said no.

121
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,661
Why did you look at your hand?
- I didn't look-

122
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,830
And where's
your wedding ring?

123
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,916
And why are there flowers everywhere
and petals all over the floor?

124
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,627
Things haven't been
right between us.

125
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,729
Well, nobody told
me that, Ian.

126
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,424
I thought they were beautiful.

127
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,301
At our anniversary dinner
two months ago,

128
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,303
you leaned into me,
you took my hand

129
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,889
and you said, "I'm so happy."
- I know. I was lying.

130
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,266
You were lying?
- I was lying.

131
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,060
No, not lying.
- I can't...

132
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,270
If you were confused
or unhappy,

133
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,606
you decide to tell me
this in a note?

134
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,734
After 13 years of marriage,
that's what I deserve?

135
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,236
I can't stand confrontation,
you know that.

136
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,530
Look, it's crappy of me,
I realize it.

137
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,783
But you deserve better.
I feel awful.

138
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,701
What am I supposed
to do then, Ian?

139
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,995
Am I supposed to sit here
and watch you leave

140
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:54,165
and not know why and just wait
until the divorce papers come?

141
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,292
I mean, what kind
of creep does that?

142
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,912
Are you that kind of creep?

143
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,730
And don't numb out on me.

144
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,883
You are not leaving
this house

145
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,678
until you at least try
to work things out with me.

146
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,605
You are my husband.

147
00:08:09,704 --> 00:08:11,224
That's the least
you can do.

148
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,864
I'm in love with
someone else, Louise.

149
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,626
There, I said it.

150
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,477
Stop packing, Ian.
- No.

151
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,916
I said stop packing.
- I'm going to Paris first thing in the morning.

152
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,835
No, you're not.
You're not going anywhere.

153
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:42,535
I'm very sorry.
- I said stop packing!

154
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,674
Wha-?

155
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,976
What the fuck?!

156
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,623
Hey! Hey, what-

157
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:10,458
Louise!
Louise!

158
00:09:10,557 --> 00:09:12,593
Louise!
Hey!

159
00:09:12,692 --> 00:09:14,170
What the fuck?!

160
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:17,180
Have you gone
completely insane?

161
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,767
Louise!
- Calm down. Calm down.

162
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,712
You'll have an aneurism.
- My head.

163
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,798
Yeah, I know.
I'm really so sorry about that.

164
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,498
I really am.
I brought you some water.

165
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,740
Fine, I'll drink it myself.

166
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,160
Ow. Oh, Ian.

167
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:42,330
Damn tooth.
I've got a cavity.

168
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,833
Why am I duct taped

169
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,044
to a fucking chair, Louise?!

170
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,380
Because, my love,

171
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:54,869
I've decided to keep you here
until we can work this out.

172
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,512
I don't love you anymore.

173
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,665
Then you'll just stay
here until you do.

174
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,876
That's completely insane.
- Why?

175
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,586
Because life
doesn't work that way.

176
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,963
You can't keep a person
hostage until they love you.

177
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,799
Oh, come on, Ian.
I'm sure it's been done before.

178
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,735
I love Sara, not you.

179
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,096
And that's not gonna change.

180
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,682
Sara? Who's Sara?
- She is the person I deeply love,

181
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,809
And you're making her
look better by the minute.

182
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,270
Well, I'm sure she'll be hurt
when you dump her,

183
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,863
but she'll live.

184
00:10:22,962 --> 00:10:25,107
As a lawyer you took
an oath to uphold the law.

185
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,610
I'm pretty sure you're not
upholding the law here.

186
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,487
I could make a case for it.

187
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,155
Louise, I hate you
and I think you're a psycho.

188
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,157
I'm gonna have you jailed
or institutionalized.

189
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,618
That'll be pretty hard to do
when you can't even move an arm.

190
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,495
I mean eventually.
After I-

191
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,497
Yes, after you're
free of course.

192
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:43,334
But by that time you won't want to
because you'll love me again.

193
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,420
No Sara, no divorce,
no pressing charges.

194
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,972
Just love,

195
00:10:48,071 --> 00:10:50,174
the way it was supposed to be
when we took our vows.

196
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,374
Do you remember, Ian?

197
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,322
Hmm.
- Hmm.

198
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,402
You know...

199
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:03,604
you know, Louise,
you're right.

200
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,698
Come here.
Come here.

201
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:07,848
Okay.
- Yeah.

202
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,586
Yeah, you know, it's...

203
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,854
You know, you're right.

204
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,035
It really isn't fair of me
to just, you know,

205
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,914
up and leave without giving us a
chance to work this through.

206
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,083
It's- yeah.
So why don't you-

207
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,085
why don't you untape me

208
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,046
and we'll sit down
and we'll talk this out, okay?

209
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,340
You won't be untaped
until you love me again.

210
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,551
Oh, come on, I love you.
I do, I swear to God.

211
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,027
You're an atheist.

212
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,446
I love you.

213
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,907
You're my wife.

214
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,069
Thank you.

215
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:46,204
Thank you
for helping me see

216
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:50,151
what a stupid stupid
thing I was about to do.

217
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,827
Yeah.

218
00:11:51,926 --> 00:11:54,796
You shocked me
into reality.

219
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,666
You really did.

220
00:11:56,765 --> 00:11:58,816
I love you.

221
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,297
I love you.

222
00:12:03,396 --> 00:12:04,715
I love you.

223
00:12:04,814 --> 00:12:07,293
You are just the worst liar.
You are.

224
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,587
Your pupils grow
to the size of Pluto,

225
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,923
your brow gets all sweaty,
you can't even look me in the eye.

226
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,223
I love you, Lou.
I do.

227
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,646
No, you don't.

228
00:12:18,745 --> 00:12:21,140
You think I'm a psycho
who you want to divorce and prosecute.

229
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,309
I'm not an idiot, okay?
- Why don't you let me go?

230
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,977
But that will change, my love, you'll see.
- Let me go.

231
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,771
Let me go.
- And we'll be happy.

232
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,981
Let me go, you fucking lunatic!
- We'll be happy.

233
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,541
Let me-

234
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,544
Sara.
- Sara?

235
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,622
Sara!

236
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:38,324
I'm a hostage here, Sara!

237
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,910
Ian, shut up.
- Hostage up here!

238
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,454
Shut up, Ian!
- Call the police!

239
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,831
Shut up, shut up.
- Call the po-

240
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,031
Shh.

241
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,858
Sara, I presume?

242
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,686
Hi. Yes, I'm Sara.

243
00:12:58,785 --> 00:13:00,862
You must be...

244
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,270
Louise.
Louise the wife.

245
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,644
I thought-
where's, um...

246
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,844
Ian.

247
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,915
Well, yeesh, is this a cliche.

248
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:15,293
But he's tied up at the moment.

249
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,463
So just come with me.

250
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,633
Let's have a chat, gal to gal.

251
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,762
Sara.
- Yeah.

252
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,139
Wow, you're very pretty.

253
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,335
Thank you.
You're very pretty too, Louise.

254
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,103
But you're like... wow.

255
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,371
Anyway.

256
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,067
Come on, sit down.

257
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,321
So...

258
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:48,049
congratulations.
My husband is leaving me for you.

259
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,706
I am so sorry, Louise.

260
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,861
I- I didn't-
I just fell in love with him.

261
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,487
I didn't mean to.
It just-

262
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,498
No need to apologize.

263
00:14:00,597 --> 00:14:02,799
I'm fine, really.

264
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,919
Really?
- Yeah.

265
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:07,095
Oh, I'm so glad.

266
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,373
I'm so glad
because I've been feeling

267
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,542
so much sadness and guilt.

268
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,427
Oh, I'm sorry.

269
00:14:13,526 --> 00:14:16,255
It must have been
so hard for you, huh?

270
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,857
It was difficult, yeah.

271
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,124
Yeah.

272
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,223
Well, there's been
a change of plans, Sara.

273
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,741
Um, Ian has decided

274
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,728
that he needs to stay
here with me

275
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,438
to go over some
final details.

276
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,448
Oh.

277
00:14:34,547 --> 00:14:38,068
Well, we were supposed to leave
first thing in the morning.

278
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:43,199
And I'd hoped that he was going
to meet my family tonight.

279
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,410
My father is making
chateaubriand and salad,

280
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,079
which is his special meal.
- Oh, I know.

281
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,514
He told me all about it,

282
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:55,211
and he's very sorry
that he can't come.

283
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,379
But he just wants
to stay here with me

284
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:00,424
and go over the boring details
of our separation.

285
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:04,524
He'll meet you at the airport.
He promises.

286
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,947
Ugh, disappointed.

287
00:15:07,046 --> 00:15:08,933
That's so selfish of me.

288
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,268
Listen, I know how you feel.

289
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,938
But I think it's very important

290
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,024
That, you know,
we go over some final things

291
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,734
before he abandons
me forever.

292
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,544
I'm sure you understand.

293
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,493
Can I see him?
Is he here?

294
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,345
He doesn't want to see you.

295
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:34,124
He said this to me,
and I quote verbatim,

296
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,584
"If I see Sara right now,

297
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:40,172
I won't be able to stay with you
for one more second.

298
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,466
I won't be able to do anything

299
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,651
except kiss her madly

300
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,429
all over every part of her face,

301
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,656
swoop her into my arms

302
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,642
and run screaming away."

303
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,173
Yeah, that sounds like him.

304
00:15:54,273 --> 00:15:56,155
Yeah.

305
00:15:56,254 --> 00:15:58,414
And I am truly sorry

306
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,360
because I forced him
to stay here tonight.

307
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,820
I hope you understand that.

308
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,463
I do.
- Yeah, thanks.

309
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,994
Can I call him
on the phone later?

310
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,663
No, I'd really prefer
that you didn't do that,

311
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,915
you know,
out of respect for me.

312
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,667
It's kind of the least
you can do.

313
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,295
But I really want
to talk to him.

314
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,172
Well, think about
how romantic it will be

315
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,174
when you're reunited
on the plane to Rome.

316
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:27,151
Paris.
- Paris.

317
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,488
Paris.
That is so romantic.

318
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,716
Wow, I always wanted
to see Paris with Ian.

319
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,371
Are you okay, Louise?

320
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,792
Thanks for asking, Sara.

321
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,628
Not really, but I will be.

322
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,365
I will be.
There's hope for me yet.

323
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,159
If you'll just excuse me.

324
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,536
Would you just
tell him that...

325
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,163
I'm thinking of him?

326
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,256
And tell him...

327
00:16:56,355 --> 00:16:59,376
I told him he had nothing to fear
about coming clean with you.

328
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:03,516
I mean, he should have
done it a year ago.

329
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,982
A year ago?

330
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,776
Yes. Yeah.

331
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,888
It probably would have
been better.

332
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,057
Tell him I'm thinking of him.

333
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,850
You're thinking of him.

334
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,493
Got it.
- Thank you.

335
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,484
Oh dear.

336
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,187
All right.

337
00:19:15,286 --> 00:19:16,814
I sent her away.

338
00:19:16,913 --> 00:19:19,683
I told her that you would
meet her at the airport

339
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:24,021
and that you and I had some
last details to work through.

340
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:27,821
She's very pretty.
Not so bright though.

341
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,486
Oh, I can't understand
what you're saying.

342
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,713
Ow!
- Sorry about that.

343
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,574
What were you
mumbling about?

344
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,369
Sara is exceptionally bright.
You don't know her.

345
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,914
Exceptionally bright?
I don't think so.

346
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,166
She introduced me
to Russian literature.

347
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,294
So that's why you were struggling
through "Brothers Karamazov"?

348
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,254
She's not only beautiful,
she's brilliant.

349
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,839
Brilliant brilliant brilliant.

350
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,841
She has the kindest heart
of anyone I've ever known.

351
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,551
I'm sure she's exceptionally
kind for a home wrecker.

352
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,032
She's also soulful, Louise.

353
00:19:57,131 --> 00:19:59,681
I'm sure there's nothing about her
that isn't completely wonderful.

354
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,475
And it doesn't matter!

355
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,019
By this time next year
you'll struggle to remember her name.

356
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,604
No, by this time next
year she'll be my wife

357
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,689
and you'll be locked away
safe in a loony bin.

358
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,859
No no, nonsense and phooey, all of it.
No more talking about her!

359
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:14,279
Okay, we'll talk about how your entire
law career will be flushed down the drain

360
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,198
once people know what
a fruitcake you are.

361
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,325
Let's talk about that.
How about we talk about that, Louise?

362
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,369
As a matter of fact...

363
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,579
No, don't tape my mouth.
- Why don't you just shut up?

364
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,998
I've had enough of that.
Louise!

365
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:29,378
Ian, why don't you just
shut up for a minute?

366
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:33,283
I want you to look
at something, buddy.

367
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,767
Hmm?
Hmm?

368
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:37,719
Do you remember this day?

369
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:41,557
Do you remember everything
about this day like I do?

370
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,609
Huh?

371
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,826
How scared I was?

372
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,188
How I almost couldn't
go through with it?

373
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,691
And do you remember-
do you remember sitting with me

374
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,818
in the back of the church

375
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,786
just holding me?

376
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:58,756
Do you remember
the promise that you made?

377
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,535
How I never had to be afraid,

378
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,136
that nobody in my life

379
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,623
would ever love me
as much as you did.

380
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,626
You said, "I promise. "
You kept saying this over and over again.

381
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,796
You kept saying, "I promise.
I promise. "

382
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,257
And when the minister
finally asked you

383
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,093
if you would take me
as your wife, you said,

384
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:21,362
"I do, I promise. "

385
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,766
Do you remember the first
years of our marriage?

386
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:28,187
The sweetness of it? I mean,
really almost the unbearable sweetness of it-

387
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,648
that feeling like
we'd tricked the world,

388
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:35,208
defied the odds
and found each other.

389
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,713
Do you remember that, Ian?

390
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,787
I have to go
to the bathroom.

391
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,947
God.

392
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,796
Do you know if we have any Tylenol in the house?
My tooth really hurts me.

393
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,064
No.

394
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,442
What's that smell?

395
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:02,194
I'm baking you some cookies.

396
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:06,225
Some chocolate chip cookies.
They're your favorite.

397
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,868
Listen, I-

398
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,779
Louise,

399
00:22:10,878 --> 00:22:13,440
I really have to go
to the bathroom.

400
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,750
You can wait.

401
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,494
I fed the fish.

402
00:22:17,593 --> 00:22:19,821
Look at yourself.
You're pathetic.

403
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,990
I mean, look what you're
stooping to here.

404
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,117
This isn't you.
I mean, you're so above this.

405
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,953
You're not desperate.
You're an accomplished woman.

406
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,288
You have an amazing career.
You got a ton of friends.

407
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,791
And you're sitting here acting like
you're a big nothing without me.

408
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:34,002
You don't need me.
- You're the only one I need.

409
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,512
Don't do that.

410
00:22:35,611 --> 00:22:38,924
I won't become just
another single, divorced,

411
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,301
40-something woman,
childless,

412
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,345
answering online
dating ads at night

413
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,472
and watching reality
television, okay?

414
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,015
And I won't get
stuck in the past

415
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:50,102
wondering whatever happened
to my best friend

416
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:54,481
off in Paris with somebody
barely out of her teens.

417
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,681
She's 24, actually.

418
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,611
I won't get addicted to ice cream
and start feeling sorry for myself

419
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,114
and gain 30 Ibs and get
set up with losers.

420
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,491
I just refuse
to be lonely.

421
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,035
I refuse to go
to movies by myself

422
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:10,372
and to deepen my friendships
with other women in my situation.

423
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,912
And I just refuse
to be without you.

424
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,211
I would rather just-
- What?

425
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:19,605
Die? Would you
actually rather die?

426
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:23,293
Let's just say
I'd rather go to jail.

427
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,146
I'm not gonna die.

428
00:23:26,245 --> 00:23:28,296
Nobody's gonna die.

429
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,353
Because everything is just-

430
00:23:34,453 --> 00:23:36,732
everything is just gonna be fine.

431
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:40,418
Louise, please just let me go.

432
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,171
No.
- Let me go.

433
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,575
Listen, why don't we
just sit down

434
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,884
and talk all this out?

435
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,972
If I'm all taped up here

436
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,625
you know we're not gonna
be able to work anything out.

437
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,825
Hmm?

438
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,554
No.

439
00:23:59,653 --> 00:24:01,381
Louise, I have to go
to the bathroom.

440
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:05,181
It's gonna get really
messy pretty soon.

441
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,680
Look, I promise
I won't run away.

442
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,641
Just like I did
that day, I promise.

443
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,993
I'm not gonna run away.

444
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,813
So why don't you just,
you know,

445
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,373
untape me now

446
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,110
while it's still
in the funny stage

447
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,430
before it gets too ugly?

448
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,201
Just say it again.
- What?

449
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,845
Just say I promise.

450
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,809
I promise.

451
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:44,674
I promise, Louise.
I won't run away.

452
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:48,012
I promise just like
I did that day

453
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:51,449
and from the deepest
part of myself.

454
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,674
Jeez.

455
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,453
Yeah, right.

456
00:25:04,552 --> 00:25:07,072
This is getting
a little crazy.

457
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,272
Yeah, well, it's...

458
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,495
I'll just go get
the scissors, okay?

459
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,695
Yeah.

460
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,018
All right.
Jeez, Ian.

461
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,562
So sorry.

462
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,440
Ah. Wow.

463
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,569
I really used a lot.

464
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,731
Oh, that's better.

465
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,600
Ian, I'm really actually
not very happy about any of this.

466
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,900
Yeah, I know how it is.

467
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,640
There you go.
- That's it.

468
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,875
Ah, it's sticky stuff.

469
00:25:43,974 --> 00:25:46,820
I'm sorry.
- Oh God, that feels better.

470
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,030
I almost got it.
- Got it?

471
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,465
Ow!

472
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,619
What did you do
to the phone, Louise?

473
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,819
Did you cut the-

474
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,461
I don't love you.
I don't want to be with you.

475
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:07,181
You're pathetic,
you're ugly and you make me sick.

476
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:12,152
Fucking psycho freak.

477
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,601
Where are your
goddamn keys, Louise?

478
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,160
Ah!
Ha!

479
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,652
Ah!

480
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:02,354
Well, I found the Tylenol.

481
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,372
It's helping just a little bit.

482
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,151
I'm gonna have to get
to the dentist next week.

483
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,278
Would you like some
Tylenol for your head?

484
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,247
Jesus.

485
00:27:12,346 --> 00:27:15,758
Is this really
happening, Louise?

486
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,669
I think it is.

487
00:27:17,768 --> 00:27:21,013
I'm hoping
it's just a bad dream.

488
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,966
Me too.

489
00:27:23,065 --> 00:27:25,377
You can end it.
- So can you.

490
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,963
Louise, what do you
want from me, huh?

491
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,340
My heart just isn't
in it anymore.

492
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,134
I simply don't want
to be with you.

493
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:35,345
Would you like a cookie?
- No.

494
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,846
They came out really good.

495
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,598
Cookies aren't gonna
do the trick, Lou.

496
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,308
Does she make you cookies?

497
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,978
No, she doesn't
make me cookies.

498
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,178
Hmm.

499
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,199
Where did you go?

500
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:50,151
I just want to know,
where did you go?

501
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,946
Did you go to her apartment?
Did you go to a hotel?

502
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,156
Did you come up here
without my knowing it?

503
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:59,051
Yes, yes and yes.

504
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:02,819
It was easy.
You worked so many hours.

505
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,668
How did you meet her?
- What does it matter?

506
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:09,337
I just want to know.
- I met her at my accountant's.

507
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,131
She's the receptionist.

508
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,341
She's Murray's receptionist?

509
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,541
Then I've met her too.

510
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,179
I don't even remember her.
She's unmemorable.

511
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,639
Yeah, well, not to a man.

512
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:25,103
She's not just a receptionist.

513
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,855
She's working on her doctorate.

514
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,655
She's gonna be a psychologist.

515
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,590
So how did you
first ask her out?

516
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,577
I mean, did you just
ask her to dinner?

517
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,679
She asked me, okay?
- Uh-huh.

518
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,708
Yeah, she called a number
of times before I said yes.

519
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,501
And at first it was
just about the sex?

520
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:51,046
At first it's always
just about the sex.

521
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,590
And then she became
your best friend?

522
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,858
Well, no.

523
00:28:56,025 --> 00:29:00,560
No?
- Louise, not every relationship is the same.

524
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,600
You always said all
you wanted in life

525
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,560
was to be married
to your best friend

526
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,395
and that you were the luckiest
man in the world

527
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,481
because you were married
to your best friend.

528
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,150
Yes, I know what I said.
But that's not the way every relationship goes.

529
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:17,197
Sometimes you don't want to be married
to your best friend because the passion gets lost.

530
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,074
So you had a lot
of passion with her?

531
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,076
Will you stop?
I'm not-

532
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,845
You know, yeah.
A truckload.

533
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,006
But no intimacy.

534
00:29:27,105 --> 00:29:30,460
Oh, it's a different
kind of intimacy.

535
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,380
What kind of intimacy
was it then?

536
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,632
A passionate kind of intimacy rife
with mystery.

537
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,550
I don't always know
what she's thinking.

538
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,594
I don't always know
what she's feeling.

539
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,554
I'm constantly
discovering things.

540
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,306
But you always said
that two people

541
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,392
Never knew each other
better than you and I,

542
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,394
That we understood
each other.

543
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,094
Yeah.
- And you loved that.

544
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:53,332
I stopped loving that.
- Why?

545
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:58,279
I don't know.
- What could be better than that?

546
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,490
Certain things are a lot better.

547
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,283
Like sex with a new person?

548
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,885
She needs me, lo.

549
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,746
Oh, I need you, Ian.

550
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,790
You haven't needed
me for years.

551
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,875
Are you kid-
you're a superwoman.

552
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:14,379
You make more money
than I do, you can fix anything,

553
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,464
You can bench-press
more than me.

554
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:19,050
What do you need me for?
- Ian, I need you.

555
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,250
I need you so much.

556
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:23,821
You need someone.
Not me.

557
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,088
Not me in particular.

558
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,672
She needs me in particular.

559
00:30:28,772 --> 00:30:31,423
All right,
I don't need you.

560
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:37,026
But I love you.
Isn't that better?

561
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,906
Oh, completely
not better, no.

562
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,592
Why did you ever
love me, Ian?

563
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,582
I don't know.
- Oh, sure you do.

564
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,668
And I want you to think about that
while I go get you some cookies.

565
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,503
No, I'm not gonna
think about it.

566
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,505
Sure you are, Ian.
Would you like some milk?

567
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:00,065
I don't want any cookies!

568
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:03,773
I'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere.

569
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,934
# Your eyes #

570
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:39,646
# They're bright
as the moon #

571
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,691
# That twinkles in June #

572
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:46,403
# But only for me #

573
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,058
# 'Cause you're heaven sent #

574
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,185
# You're the main event #

575
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:55,454
# My love, it's true #

576
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:58,999
# And I thank
my lucky stars... #

577
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:06,950
These are the exact same cookies
I've been making for you all of these years.

578
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,827
But these are extra special

579
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,287
because I put
a magic spell on them.

580
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:14,624
When you eat one, you will
deeply love me again

581
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,668
for the rest of your life
and beyond.

582
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,636
Ugh.

583
00:32:18,735 --> 00:32:21,355
Just kidding.

584
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,757
Just have a bite.
- No.

585
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,592
Just have a bite of the cookie.
Come on.

586
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:28,763
You really need to eat.
- I don't want it, Louise.

587
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,182
Come on. Come on, honey.
- Don't do that. Don't please.

588
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,382
Just don't-

589
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,897
Your mother made me
promise on her deathbed

590
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:41,150
that I would continue to make you
these cookies for the rest of your life.

591
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,486
She said I was the best thing
that ever happened to you;

592
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,447
that until you met me
you had no direction and no purpose.

593
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:49,033
I picked you up by your bootstraps
and gave you a life.

594
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,919
You did.

595
00:32:51,018 --> 00:32:53,913
Do you think she would approve
of what's happening right now?

596
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,291
I don't think she'd want
to see me taped to a toilet.

597
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,501
I don't mean that.
I mean, do you think

598
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,254
she would want you to leave me
for Murray's receptionist?

599
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,715
What my dead mother
thinks I should do

600
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,925
is no great concern to me.
- It should be.

601
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,886
What anyone thinks I should do
is not a big concern.

602
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,471
You could name any member
of my family, dead and alive,

603
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:16,978
and tell me they don't agree
with what I'm doing and I could care less.

604
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,521
Would you like
another cookie?

605
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,615
Not really.

606
00:33:20,714 --> 00:33:23,583
How about some music?
Hmm?

607
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,663
How about some music, Ian?
Huh?

608
00:33:26,762 --> 00:33:30,090
Oh! Oh, this is beautiful.

609
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,467
Beautiful.

610
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,797
Mm-hmm.

611
00:33:35,896 --> 00:33:38,390
Oh God.

612
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,671
Oh, that's stooping
low, Louise.

613
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,939
We danced to it at-

614
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,842
yes, at our wedding.
I remember.

615
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,011
Seems like a lifetime ago.

616
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,446
Right outside this window.

617
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:56,283
# But only for me #

618
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,102
# 'Cause you're
heaven sent... #

619
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:02,522
You said it was the happiest
day of your life.

620
00:34:02,622 --> 00:34:05,276
A relationship ending
is like a death

621
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,154
that just two people
know about.

622
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,756
A whole life gets lost.

623
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,867
Everything we did together,

624
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,869
all the places we traveled,

625
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,054
the fights,

626
00:34:17,153 --> 00:34:20,078
the small moments
of tenderness.

627
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:25,239
Don't forget all the failed
in-vitro attempts.

628
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,050
How could you say that to me?

629
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,718
How could you say
that to me?

630
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,345
Do you want
to hurt me even more?

631
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,222
No, I'm just
remembering everything,

632
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,598
And it wasn't all perfect.

633
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:38,101
Perfect?
Who said it was perfect?

634
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,811
You used to say
it was perfect.

635
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,939
You said it all the time.
"Aren't we perfect?"

636
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,565
God, it was a lot
to live up to.

637
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,317
It was just too much
to sustain.

638
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,069
I mean, it was like
it wasn't real.

639
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,579
It was real.

640
00:34:49,678 --> 00:34:51,823
Yeah, until we stopped
trying to have a child.

641
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,283
And is that why?
Is that why you want to leave me?

642
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,244
Because I didn't
have your child?

643
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,288
No no. It's what happened
after, Louise.

644
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,833
You became human.
I saw your flaws.

645
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,085
You talk too loud, you know?
You talk over me.

646
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,837
And the sex,
it became so mechanical.

647
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,255
No, no it didn't.

648
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,565
And you were
always in denial.

649
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:25,211
God, Ian, we spent
so many weekends

650
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,066
in this house trying
to get pregnant.

651
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:30,168
I counted meals.

652
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,289
What?

653
00:35:33,388 --> 00:35:36,117
When we came up here,
sometimes the meals were so strained

654
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,252
I would count them.

655
00:35:38,351 --> 00:35:40,402
I hated them.

656
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:46,169
I started counting them to see
how many of them were left in the day.

657
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,369
You stopped loving me.

658
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,308
I never knew.

659
00:35:52,407 --> 00:35:54,802
You know, I tried to pretend
it wasn't happening.

660
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:57,138
I thought if I could
pretend it wasn't happening

661
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,158
maybe somehow
it would go away.

662
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,681
And then you met Sara.

663
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,780
And then I met Sara.

664
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:07,815
And you succumbed to her.

665
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:10,167
I succumbed.

666
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,323
I don't believe you
really love that woman.

667
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,916
Not really.

668
00:36:17,015 --> 00:36:18,659
You can believe
anything you want.

669
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,662
But I'm going
to Paris with her.

670
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:24,540
I guarantee you I will
be on that plane tomorrow.

671
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,084
I still guarantee you won't.

672
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,461
And I'm going to propose
that she be my wife.

673
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,172
No, you're not.
- Oh, I certainly am.

674
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,049
No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

675
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,967
I'm telling you right
now there's no way.

676
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:38,679
Could you please leave me alone?
I need to use the bathroom.

677
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:41,031
Not that this isn't fun.

678
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:48,121
God.

679
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,701
Excuse me.

680
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,028
Have you ever heard of
the Stockholm syndrome?

681
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,490
Yes. Hostage falls in love
with their captor.

682
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,542
Yes.

683
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:02,745
It's gonna take something
much bigger.

684
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,945
An act of God really.

685
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,850
Now please close the door.

686
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,423
Close the door, please.

687
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,392
Close it!

688
00:37:16,491 --> 00:37:18,542
Close the door!

689
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,350
Lake Ashimi.
That was the trip we fell in love.

690
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,727
Do you remember?
- Uh-huh.

691
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,404
Mm-hmm. Oh.

692
00:37:28,503 --> 00:37:30,239
Your first office.

693
00:37:30,338 --> 00:37:33,109
You remember I came by to put
your name on the door?

694
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:36,544
That was nice of you.
- Yeah.

695
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,089
And there- aw.

696
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,284
Ian:
The night I proposed to you

697
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,958
in front of
El Troubadour's.

698
00:37:44,057 --> 00:37:46,111
Yes.
- Mmm.

699
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,798
You said yes.

700
00:37:47,897 --> 00:37:49,333
Yeah, without hesitation.

701
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,335
You were sweating.
I felt so bad for you.

702
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,588
Well, I was scared
you'd say no.

703
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,257
I said yes like
17 times in a row.

704
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,100
Want some?
- No.

705
00:37:58,199 --> 00:37:59,886
This just isn't fair, Lou.

706
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,812
Yes, it is.

707
00:38:01,911 --> 00:38:03,973
It's more than fair, it's fact.

708
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:07,310
That was the day
we painted our house.

709
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,896
Was it after we got married?
- No, it was just before.

710
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,096
Oh.

711
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,880
Do you remember, Ian?

712
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,925
Hmm?
- Turn it off, Louise.

713
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,455
I'm not finished yet.
- Yeah, but I'm finished.

714
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,707
It doesn't matter
what you show me.

715
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,251
We're not those people anymore.
- Oh, yes, we are.

716
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:35,421
None of the slides you've shown me
are from the last 10 years.

717
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,673
I mean, where are those slides?
We don't have them.

718
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,592
Whatever we had
that was so special

719
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,677
just doesn't
exist anymore.

720
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,055
We just need
to make more slides.

721
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,515
No, no more slides.
No more anything.

722
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,976
No more life together.
In fact, you know what? From this moment on,

723
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,729
I'm just gonna scream
and be as unpleasant as possible

724
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,648
until you let me fucking go!

725
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,700
Look at this one.

726
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:58,569
I'm trapped with a lunatic.
- Stop it. Stop yelling.

727
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,655
Stop yelling, Ian,
and look at the slides.

728
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,048
Help!
- Stop yelling!

729
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:06,718
I can't take it anymore!
- Ian!

730
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:10,722
Help, my wife has lost
her fucking mind!

731
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,417
My wife,
she's completely psychotic!

732
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,002
Anybody, please help!

733
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:18,005
If you can hear me,
I'm being held hostage

734
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:21,165
and I'm taped to a toilet!
Help!

735
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,765
Please come and help me!

736
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,965
Hel-

737
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,479
You look very nice, Louise.

738
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,072
Thank you.

739
00:39:35,171 --> 00:39:36,899
I haven't seen you
in a sexy dress

740
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,063
in quite a long time.

741
00:39:39,162 --> 00:39:41,612
Doesn't change a thing,
of course.

742
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,489
What's the guitar for?

743
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,715
I am going to play...

744
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,203
and sing you a song.

745
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,921
Please don't.

746
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,791
I'm gonna serenade you
like we did

747
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,043
when we first met.
And you're gonna like it.

748
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,087
God, no. I'm so embarrassed
for you right now.

749
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,214
Will you just listen, Ian?

750
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,757
Oh God, no no no.

751
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,726
# My love and I #

752
00:40:03,825 --> 00:40:06,012
# Were washed up at sea #

753
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:09,948
# And quietly he looked at me #

754
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,601
# I said, "What do you need #

755
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,828
# My love, my love? #

756
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:19,040
# What do you,
what do you need?" #

757
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,079
# Coconuts- #

758
00:40:23,178 --> 00:40:25,672
Louise, this is beyond-

759
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,034
it's just so not working.
Put the guitar down.

760
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:31,746
I just can't remember the words.
Shit, how does it go?

761
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,214
Wait.

762
00:40:33,313 --> 00:40:36,015
# In the moonlight #

763
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:40,061
# La la la. #

764
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,436
Well, I would applaud

765
00:40:47,535 --> 00:40:49,221
but you made
that impossible.

766
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,932
You could applaud
with your face.

767
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:56,228
Does it look like
I'm applauding with my face?

768
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,689
No.
- You knocked me out cold

769
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,274
and you taped me
to a toilet.

770
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,943
Your romance is
completely lost on me.

771
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,883
I mean, it's more like torture.

772
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,075
Now it's going
to take a miracle,

773
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,118
nothing less.
And since we both know

774
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,371
the odds of something
otherworldly happening here,

775
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,164
why don't you
just let me go?

776
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,364
No.

777
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:21,269
Louise, just give up.

778
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:24,105
I won't.

779
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,857
How are you doing?

780
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:11,178
Bored and angry, want to wring
your fucking neck- same as before.

781
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,230
Just checking.

782
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:15,433
Listen, I'm gonna be going
to the market in town

783
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,268
'cause I'm gonna make you a really fancy
romantic dinner.

784
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,403
Any requests?

785
00:42:19,502 --> 00:42:22,106
Could you get me my cell phone?
And why don't you drop dead?

786
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,816
You don't mean that, baby.

787
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,402
Now the only way I would eat
your fancy romantic dinner

788
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:30,342
is if you'd force-feed it
down my throat.

789
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:27,854
...984, 985,

790
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,690
986,

791
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,810
987, 988,

792
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:36,779
989, 990...

793
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,991
991, 992.

794
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,879
Hey hey!

795
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,999
Hey! Whoa! Hello!

796
00:43:55,098 --> 00:43:58,801
Up here! Help!

797
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,721
Hey!

798
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:10,104
Help! Help!

799
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,807
Hey, listen to me.
I'm trapped up here. Help me.

800
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,033
Help me!

801
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,702
Help!

802
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:34,997
Help!

803
00:44:35,096 --> 00:44:38,424
Hey, help!

804
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:45,592
Help.

805
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,132
Help help help help.

806
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:31,936
Help.

807
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,183
Hello.

808
00:45:36,282 --> 00:45:37,935
Are you there?

809
00:45:38,034 --> 00:45:40,319
Help!

810
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:43,057
# It's not my fault I look better
in her party dress #

811
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:46,226
# It's not my fault that
you left your slutty girlfriend #

812
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:49,229
# It's not my fault,
this is how my mama made me #

813
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,731
# I've been magnetic
since I was a baby... #

814
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,999
Help!

815
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,944
# It's not my fault I look cuter
in his boxing gloves #

816
00:45:56,044 --> 00:46:00,032
# It's not my fault that she left you
for my shiny tongue... #

817
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:03,926
Help!

818
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,372
Yo, please shut the fuck up.
I'm trying to rob you.

819
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,572
What?

820
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:11,377
I said shut up or I'll bash your stupid
fucking head in.

821
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:14,687
Talk about an easy target.

822
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:18,092
You come into a house
and the owner's already tied up for you.

823
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,761
It's a beautiful beautiful thing,

824
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,514
Proof of a higher power,
if you ask me.

825
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,600
You're never gonna
get away with this.

826
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,360
I told you
to shut up, man.

827
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,824
Thank you.

828
00:46:33,923 --> 00:46:37,194
# I've been magnetic
since I was a baby #

829
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,113
# In my fist
there's a song #

830
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,781
# Do you wanna
sing along? #

831
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,633
# Yeah yeah yeah yeah #

832
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,369
# In my fist
there's a song #

833
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,037
# Do you wanna
sing along? #

834
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:51,057
# Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. #

835
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,177
Hey.

836
00:46:53,276 --> 00:46:56,145
Um, excuse me, sir,

837
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:59,591
do you happen to have
any cash on you?

838
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:02,151
No, I don't.

839
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,223
You don't have any cash?

840
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,991
No, I have no cash.

841
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,164
God.

842
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:18,444
Are you sure you don't
have any cash?

843
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,644
God.

844
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,706
It's-
- Huh?

845
00:47:22,805 --> 00:47:24,158
My wallet in my pants.

846
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,160
Wallet's in your pants?

847
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,678
Yeah.
- That's great.

848
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,798
Look at you, man.

849
00:47:30,897 --> 00:47:33,928
You're taped
to a fucking toilet.

850
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:39,131
Not that I care really,
but who did this to you?

851
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,331
My wife.

852
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,512
You pussy.
That's perfect.

853
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:49,057
Holy shit, your fucking wife
taped you to a goddamn toilet.

854
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,602
What a day
you're having, huh?

855
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,188
You must feel
pretty humiliated.

856
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,948
Yep.

857
00:47:56,047 --> 00:47:58,400
See, here's the difference
between you and me, man-

858
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,444
whenever I get the urge
to get married

859
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,629
I grab my balls

860
00:48:02,728 --> 00:48:04,665
and I squeeze them

861
00:48:04,764 --> 00:48:06,617
until I can't feel my legs

862
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,937
and then it just passes.

863
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:13,306
What did you do to her?

864
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:16,335
Excuse me?
- To your wife to make her tape you to a toilet.

865
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,253
You must have done
something to her.

866
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:19,880
That's none
of your business.

867
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,882
I'm so interested
in human nature,

868
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:26,650
like what makes people do
the things that they do.

869
00:48:26,749 --> 00:48:29,640
My girlfriend thinks
I could be a philosopher.

870
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,308
I got this theory about love.

871
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,810
You wanna hear it?
- No.

872
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,312
I think that love
is an experiment

873
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,406
by a higher power.

874
00:48:37,505 --> 00:48:39,525
Call it God
or whatever you want,

875
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,861
but I think that it's still being worked out,
you know, the kinks.

876
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:45,614
It's not complete.
It's like a test.

877
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,416
Brilliant.

878
00:48:47,515 --> 00:48:49,326
Listen to me.
If love is a test,

879
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,036
then you're failing, okay?

880
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,914
And in the grand scheme of things
that makes you a failure.

881
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,582
No, that does not
make me a failure.

882
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:57,960
Okay, you promised this woman
that you'd love her

883
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,545
for the rest
of your life, right?

884
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:02,506
And clearly- clearly,
you're failing at that.

885
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,259
You failed her.
Yeah, man, you're a failure.

886
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,428
Who are you to judge me?
You're a criminal.

887
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:11,348
Fuck you, man.
I'm an honest person.

888
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,983
Oh.
- Yeah.

889
00:49:13,082 --> 00:49:15,561
I never- I never pretend
to be anything I'm not.

890
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:18,605
And I would never promise
anyone the moon

891
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:21,900
and then mean only "until I get tired
of giving you the moon"-

892
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,111
Never, all right?
- Mm-hmm.

893
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,572
So you think about that while I'm loading
your belongings into my van.

894
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,123
Mm-hmm.

895
00:49:28,222 --> 00:49:30,273
You pussy loser.

896
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,957
Who the fuck is that?
- Louise.

897
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,475
Oh, shit.

898
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:40,802
Oh, no.

899
00:49:40,901 --> 00:49:42,846
Hello, my love.

900
00:49:42,945 --> 00:49:45,815
I'm home.

901
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,403
Lou! Lou!

902
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,189
Louise: No no no!

903
00:49:52,288 --> 00:49:54,232
No! Please please.

904
00:49:54,331 --> 00:49:56,382
God, don't hurt her.

905
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:00,413
Louise.
Louise.

906
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,791
Don't hurt her!

907
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:17,471
Louise.

908
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,084
Louise. Oh my God,
is she dead?

909
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,769
She definitely looks dead.

910
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:26,564
What did you do to her?

911
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,133
What'd do you do
to her?

912
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:30,135
I just made her
really really quiet.

913
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,971
It was fun too.
You want me to do it to you?

914
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,973
You know what we need?

915
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:37,517
I wish we had a matching
toilet to tape her to.

916
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:39,869
That'd be pretty funny.

917
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:44,665
Shit, nice tits.

918
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,193
Mind if I squeeze them
a little bit?

919
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,393
Don't you touch her.

920
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:52,616
Or what? What, you're gonna
urinate on yourself?

921
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,201
I'll kill you,
I swear to God.

922
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:57,287
Just look that way for a second.
Just look that way.

923
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,139
Oh, shit.
- Stop it!

924
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:04,143
God, I would never
get sick of these.

925
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:10,509
When was the last time
you touched these tits?

926
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:13,569
Fuck, she's perfect, man.

927
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:16,197
You lucky bastard.

928
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:19,700
Oh, God, what I would
do to you.

929
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:23,204
Shit.
You lucky fuck.

930
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:25,748
Oh my God.

931
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,501
Oh, God.

932
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:39,531
I don't think he'll kill us,
'cause we can't see his face.

933
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:44,584
I don't care about anything
we own in this house.

934
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:47,019
I mean...

935
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,464
it sounds like
he's just taking

936
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:52,824
everything that's not
strapped down.

937
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:59,766
I hope he doesn't-
I hope he doesn't take

938
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:02,602
that silverware set
your mother left us-

939
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:05,371
that antique set.

940
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:09,039
I wish we had left that
in the city.

941
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,662
You know,

942
00:52:12,761 --> 00:52:16,048
there is that
expensive painting

943
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,168
that we invested in.

944
00:52:18,267 --> 00:52:20,537
What was
the artist's name?

945
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,737
Kamasuki?
Kamayudo?

946
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:25,391
Yeah.

947
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,893
I hate that painting.

948
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,547
I don't care
if it's worth 20 grand.

949
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:34,676
I mean, it looks like it was made
by a third grader really.

950
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:37,554
What did you say?
You said it reminded you of the rain.

951
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,307
The only reason I bought it
was to make you happy

952
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:43,576
and to remind you
of the rain.

953
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:49,665
Oh my God,
look at us, Louise.

954
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,209
This is- it's ridiculous.

955
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:55,530
I mean, for all I know,
this is how it's gonna end for us-

956
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,241
right here in this bathroom
with the wallpaper I hate.

957
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:03,401
Why the hell did we not ever take
this wallpaper down?

958
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:17,193
I do remember that day

959
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,262
in the coat room
of the church

960
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:22,140
when I was holding you
and I was just rocking you.

961
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,910
I was just rocking you
back and forth.

962
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:30,217
And you got dust
all over your wedding gown.

963
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:35,294
You looked so beautiful.

964
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:43,928
I was terrified.

965
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:50,514
It's not your fault, Louise.

966
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:53,763
It's not your fault

967
00:53:53,862 --> 00:53:55,715
that we couldn't
have children.

968
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:57,717
And I started
hating my life,

969
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,803
hating my boss,
hating the advertising industry,

970
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,721
hating our apartment,
hating this house,

971
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:04,224
everything that we bought
that we thought we wanted,

972
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,476
just hating everything.
I just started feeling

973
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,478
like a big
miserable bastard

974
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,829
because we, you know-

975
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:12,941
some people have nothing
and there we were.

976
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:15,694
We could buy stupid
expensive paintings.

977
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:19,713
Some people have nothing.

978
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:22,383
Say something, Louise.

979
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,452
Tell me about
your crazy job.

980
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:26,413
Tell me about your
hectic schedule.

981
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,415
Complain for me, Louise.

982
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,417
Just say something, please.

983
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,302
Come on, Louise.

984
00:54:32,401 --> 00:54:34,129
Don't leave me alone
here in this bathroom

985
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,981
wondering if
I'm gonna die.

986
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:39,718
Don't leave me alone, Louise.
Come on, just say something.

987
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:43,678
Please, come on.
I'll listen. I'll listen.

988
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:46,407
What the fuck?

989
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:49,394
Is he having a party here now?

990
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:52,261
You can't do that.

991
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:58,544
Oh, shit.
Fucking loser.

992
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,966
Fucking loser.

993
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:10,853
I know what I am, Louise.

994
00:55:10,952 --> 00:55:13,392
I'm a nothing.

995
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:19,261
I don't stand
for anything anymore.

996
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:22,651
I am just a loser

997
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,362
taped to a toilet.

998
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,976
And it would be
poetic justice

999
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:32,953
ff this is where I died.

1000
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:43,205
You didn't marry
this man, Louise.

1001
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:49,537
Why do you think
I wanted to go to Paris?

1002
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:52,499
I had this romantic idea
of myself, you know-

1003
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:55,252
That I could maybe be
a hero to somebody again,

1004
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:58,145
Just maybe.

1005
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,973
But look at me.
I'm a joke.

1006
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:06,570
You didn't marry a joke.

1007
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:09,516
You married somebody
who had dreams, you know,

1008
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:13,952
who promised you the world.

1009
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:17,732
And look what
you ended up with-

1010
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:20,209
someone who lied to you,

1011
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:24,338
who deceived you,

1012
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:27,886
who couldn't protect you
in the end-

1013
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,305
a loser on a toilet.

1014
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,143
I'm sorry, Louise.

1015
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,662
I'm-

1016
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:44,233
I'm so so sorry.

1017
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,723
Three, two...

1018
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:03,953
That was so loud.

1019
00:57:04,052 --> 00:57:06,171
Come here.

1020
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:11,494
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
- Jesus Christ.

1021
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:14,179
Oops, sorry about the rug.

1022
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:16,299
Sorry about your rug.

1023
00:57:16,398 --> 00:57:18,449
Shh.

1024
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,565
How did you do that?

1025
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,832
How did you
do that?

1026
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:45,294
Hello?

1027
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,245
Hello?
Is anybody there?

1028
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:51,334
Ian?

1029
00:57:51,433 --> 00:57:54,662
Ian, where-?
Oh my God, where are you?

1030
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:58,390
Louise Louise Louise.

1031
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,244
Ian.

1032
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:08,510
Louise, we're in the bathroom.
We're being robbed.

1033
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,674
Oh.
- Are you okay?

1034
00:58:10,773 --> 00:58:13,348
I can't move my arms
or my legs.

1035
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:17,034
You're taped, Lou.
Can you stand?

1036
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:19,104
I don't know.
I'm just gonna-

1037
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,622
I'm just gonna try.

1038
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:23,733
See if you could go over
to the light switch.

1039
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,568
And maybe you could
rub against it

1040
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,320
and maybe you could
turn it on or something.

1041
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:31,282
Oh, God, my head just hurts
and my tooth is throbbing.

1042
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:33,334
I'm just a mess.

1043
00:58:33,433 --> 00:58:35,286
I know, I know, I know.

1044
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:38,126
I just want to see your face.

1045
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:44,102
There you are.

1046
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:46,222
I'm so sorry, Ian.

1047
00:58:46,321 --> 00:58:48,372
Shh, no, it's okay.

1048
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,176
It's not your fault.

1049
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:52,887
Lou, why don't you
just try the door?

1050
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:54,889
What?
- Try the doorknob.

1051
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:58,529
Maybe you can escape
through the back.

1052
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:04,831
I can't get a grip.

1053
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:07,099
Shit.

1054
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:11,296
Oh, God.

1055
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:13,564
Well...

1056
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:17,921
Did he touch you?

1057
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:21,431
No, he just-

1058
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:26,061
I came home
and he- I just was-

1059
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,423
everything was gone.
All our stuff was

1060
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,925
all over the floor
in garbage bags.

1061
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:33,694
And then he jumped me

1062
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:36,347
and then he smashed
my head into the ground.

1063
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,892
And I just don't remember
anything after that.

1064
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,318
I'll kill him.

1065
00:59:40,417 --> 00:59:42,869
Ian, I'm so ashamed.

1066
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:45,440
I'm so ashamed
for what I did to you.

1067
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,158
No no no.

1068
00:59:47,257 --> 00:59:49,118
I'm ashamed.

1069
00:59:49,217 --> 00:59:52,368
I'm ashamed of what
I did to you.

1070
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:56,576
Do you think
he'll kill us?

1071
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,578
I don't know.
Come sit next to me.

1072
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:00,246
I want you to sit
next to me.

1073
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:01,673
Why?

1074
01:00:01,772 --> 01:00:05,443
I just want you to be
next to me, Lou.

1075
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:14,969
Maybe we'll only have
an hour left together,

1076
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:17,362
maybe 15 minutes,

1077
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,849
but let's talk this through.

1078
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,851
Let's work our marriage out

1079
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,978
Even if it's only
for 15 minutes.

1080
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:27,899
Are you just saying that
because you're taped to a toilet?

1081
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:32,294
I've had a lot of time
to think about this,

1082
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:36,089
and I don't want
to fail you.

1083
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:38,159
I'm pretty sure
I still love you.

1084
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:40,745
Sure I want to kill you
sometimes.

1085
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:42,797
Like all day today.

1086
01:00:42,896 --> 01:00:46,668
Well, yeah, you know,
'cause you just make me crazy.

1087
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:50,296
You just talk talk talk
talk talk talk over me.

1088
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:52,674
And you're so opinionated,

1089
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:54,801
you know, sometimes
it just makes me numb.

1090
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,053
I won't do that anymore.
I won't talk over you

1091
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:59,180
and I won't have
opinions, I promise.

1092
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,365
You can have opinions.

1093
01:01:01,464 --> 01:01:03,851
You should quit
your stupid job.

1094
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:06,354
You'd be so much happier
if you just quit your stupid job.

1095
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:08,189
You hate working
at that company.

1096
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:10,916
You're right.

1097
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:14,086
I should quit.
I should quit

1098
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:16,155
And I should take
the money that I've saved

1099
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:18,157
and I should open up
my own company.

1100
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:20,159
My clients-
they'd follow me.

1101
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:21,828
Yeah, that's a beautiful idea.

1102
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,454
Yeah!
You know what else?

1103
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:25,206
We should keep trying
to have a child,

1104
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:27,683
or we could even adopt.

1105
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,505
Do you mean that?

1106
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:34,098
Yes.

1107
01:01:34,197 --> 01:01:37,677
Not just because
you're taped to a toilet?

1108
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:41,113
I mean it.

1109
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,142
And I need to start
romancing you a little more...

1110
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:46,603
Yeah.
- ... just like I did when we first were married.

1111
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,605
I miss those days, Lou.

1112
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:52,225
Every day you'd look
all sexy for me.

1113
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:55,194
You called me ugly.

1114
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:57,713
You're not ugly.

1115
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,074
You are a beautiful woman.

1116
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:02,577
You were gonna leave me
for a child.

1117
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:04,762
I'm not leaving you.

1118
01:02:04,861 --> 01:02:06,080
You had an affair.

1119
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,707
People have affairs.

1120
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:11,143
And they end.

1121
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:13,713
I'm gonna make it up
to you, Lou,

1122
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,913
I promise.

1123
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,628
Oh.

1124
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:01,519
Ugh.

1125
01:03:01,618 --> 01:03:03,669
The light just blew.

1126
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:09,040
Better to see you
in the moonlight.

1127
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:09,261
Ian!

1128
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:17,018
Ian, open the door.

1129
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,896
Ian, I'm serious.

1130
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:29,273
Who are you?

1131
01:04:29,372 --> 01:04:31,616
Oh, shit.

1132
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:35,813
Oh, I guess they made up.

1133
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:38,498
Ian, Ian, what is going on?

1134
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,193
Be quiet, lady, please.

1135
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,236
Whoa, hey, please,
come on, don't hurt her.

1136
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:44,906
"Oh, please don't
hurt her. "

1137
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:46,574
Why? What are you
gonna do about it,

1138
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:49,843
Huh, toilet man?

1139
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:52,538
I hope nobody else shows up.
We're running out of tape.

1140
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:54,764
We only have one roll.

1141
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:58,544
Haven't you gotten
everything you've wanted?

1142
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:02,022
Why don't you just
leave already?

1143
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:04,300
Look at the sexy,
kinky bondage couple.

1144
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,620
You guys are
into some weird shit.

1145
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:12,866
Please just let us go.

1146
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:15,368
Let me think about that.

1147
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:19,106
Nope, I don't think so.

1148
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:21,958
Hey. Ow!
- Hey, don't you-

1149
01:05:22,126 --> 01:05:23,828
Shut up.

1150
01:05:23,927 --> 01:05:25,978
Hey!

1151
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:29,784
You know, I actually
prefer the older one.

1152
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:33,830
The younger one reminds me
of my whiny bitch girlfriend.

1153
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,833
What's your name,
beautiful, huh?

1154
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,126
Come on, why are you being like this?
What's your name?

1155
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:41,178
Louise.
- Louise.

1156
01:05:41,277 --> 01:05:43,292
Stop. Stop it.

1157
01:05:43,392 --> 01:05:44,966
Do you know
I find you beautiful?

1158
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:46,350
I do, I do-

1159
01:05:46,449 --> 01:05:49,986
Every pore, every line,
every curve.

1160
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:52,807
You deserve better than that ape.
Do you know that?

1161
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:55,935
I'd know what to do with you.
God, I want you so bad.

1162
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:57,770
Hey, leave her alone!

1163
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,970
No no no!
- No!

1164
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:03,451
No no!
- No no!

1165
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:06,279
No no, please.
I'll do whatever you want.

1166
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,164
Oh, no.

1167
01:06:08,263 --> 01:06:11,033
Woman: Babycakes,
you're taking too long.

1168
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:13,551
Whiny bitch.

1169
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,488
Coming, sweetness.

1170
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:45,682
Sara...

1171
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:49,447
Oh my God.
- Calm down. Calm down, calm down.

1172
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:52,366
He's gonna kills us.
We're gonna die.

1173
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:54,994
And we're gonna spend
our last moments on earth

1174
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:56,871
with your stupid ex-wife.

1175
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:59,131
Um, we're still married.

1176
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,877
We're not gonna die.
Please calm down.

1177
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:05,077
Oh my God.

1178
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:09,675
Why was she sitting
on your lap?

1179
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:13,262
Oh, when you didn't
show up at the airport

1180
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:15,314
I was so angry!

1181
01:07:15,413 --> 01:07:17,316
I drove straight here.

1182
01:07:17,415 --> 01:07:19,352
Okay, Sara, Sara,
you're gonna have to-

1183
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:22,704
Sara! Sara,
try to calm yourself.

1184
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:25,024
We're just being
robbed here.

1185
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:27,026
Oh, God, they taped you
to the toilet.

1186
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:29,335
No, I did that.

1187
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:31,038
What?

1188
01:07:31,137 --> 01:07:32,990
It's a long story.
It doesn't matter.

1189
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:37,260
Ian, are you reconciling
with your wife?

1190
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,048
Yes, he is.

1191
01:07:41,147 --> 01:07:43,998
I didn't ask you.
I asked him.

1192
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:48,014
Um...

1193
01:07:48,113 --> 01:07:49,882
Oh, Ian, just tell her.
Just tell her.

1194
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:52,400
Get it over with.

1195
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:55,070
Sara,

1196
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:58,432
I'm really very sorry
about everything.

1197
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:01,018
No, you don't love her, Ian.
You love me.

1198
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:04,162
I'm your little Russian bobo.

1199
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,732
She's your little
Russian bobo?

1200
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:09,292
They are going to kill us.

1201
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:11,112
We have to remain calm!

1202
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:13,838
I wasn't talking to you.

1203
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:16,242
I was talking
to my boyfriend.

1204
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:18,911
I don't care
what you think.

1205
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:21,497
I care what he thinks.
Oh, have you seen this?

1206
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:23,549
Check this out.

1207
01:08:23,648 --> 01:08:26,293
I don't know, that must
have cost him $10,000.

1208
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:29,505
Sara-
- You spent $10,000 on a bracelet for her?

1209
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:31,048
It was about $3,000.

1210
01:08:31,148 --> 01:08:33,217
Yeah, he did,
because he's in love with me.

1211
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:35,417
You!

1212
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,196
Okay, please.

1213
01:08:45,295 --> 01:08:46,981
Please, this isn't helping.

1214
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,108
Please, we are in a dangerous
situation here.

1215
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:51,308
Please.

1216
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:54,038
Now listen.

1217
01:08:54,137 --> 01:08:55,990
Sara, he didn't use
that much tape on you.

1218
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,950
Why don't you see
if you can free your hands?

1219
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:01,203
I'm not moving, Ian,
until you tell your wife

1220
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:03,205
That you are
leaving her forever.

1221
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:06,208
Can we please just
work all that out later?

1222
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:07,501
We are in danger.

1223
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:09,378
Okay, fine,
so just tell her, Ian,

1224
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:12,238
and I'll do
whatever you say.

1225
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,717
Fine, if that's all it takes.

1226
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:17,511
Louise, I'm leaving you
for Sara.

1227
01:09:17,611 --> 01:09:18,729
Fine.

1228
01:09:18,828 --> 01:09:20,306
And he's not just
saying that to shut me up.

1229
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:22,308
He's saying it
because it's true.

1230
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:24,310
And believe me,
however this works out,

1231
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,687
we will be in Paris
together next week

1232
01:09:26,787 --> 01:09:28,981
and you'll be crying
to your girlfriends.

1233
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:31,181
Stop!

1234
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:36,588
Please try
freeing yourself.

1235
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:46,841
I can't.

1236
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:48,509
Try harder.

1237
01:09:48,608 --> 01:09:51,459
You know what?
I said I can't.

1238
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:55,883
Louise, would you please
just go help her?

1239
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:57,218
I don't want
to touch her.

1240
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:59,652
Louise!
- Fine.

1241
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:08,729
Oh, God, it's just
not working, Ian.

1242
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:13,249
Oh, I hate you, Ian.
I wish I'd never met you.

1243
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:16,453
Shh.

1244
01:10:16,552 --> 01:10:20,673
Shh.
Shh shh shh.

1245
01:10:20,841 --> 01:10:22,941
Did you hear that?

1246
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:27,005
I think they're leaving.

1247
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:29,967
Whoo!

1248
01:10:30,066 --> 01:10:31,627
He's riding away
on a lawnmower.

1249
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:34,463
Sara, Sara, did you see
any kind of vehicle,

1250
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,298
like from a lawn company
or anything?

1251
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:41,971
Well, I was pretty angry and upset
when I got here, Ian, so I-

1252
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,598
I think-
yeah, maybe I saw a van

1253
01:10:44,698 --> 01:10:47,226
and a car or two.
I don't remember.

1254
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:48,569
A van?

1255
01:10:48,668 --> 01:10:52,163
Yes, I saw a van-
an unmarked van.

1256
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:54,316
Doesn't our lawn company
have a company van?

1257
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:57,862
I- I'm trying to remember.
I don't know.

1258
01:10:57,962 --> 01:11:01,615
I mean, yes, they do.
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I'm sure they do.

1259
01:11:01,715 --> 01:11:03,659
So who are these guys?

1260
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:05,536
I don't know.
I didn't think we had anyone

1261
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:07,746
working on our lawn
until next month.

1262
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:11,000
Some strange guy shows up
and starts mowing our lawn.

1263
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,960
Maybe that's how
he operates, you know.

1264
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,504
Maybe he just stakes out
empty houses

1265
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:17,298
during the week
and robs them.

1266
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:19,758
And maybe he just didn't
count on finding us here.

1267
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:23,858
Well, let's listen
and see if they're gone.

1268
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:27,532
I don't hear anything.

1269
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,784
No.

1270
01:11:29,884 --> 01:11:32,745
And they didn't kill us.

1271
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:36,890
They just left.

1272
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:45,758
They just left.

1273
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:48,996
Look, I need to know
right now

1274
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:50,831
whether or not
you're going back

1275
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:53,311
to your ugly fucking wife.

1276
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:58,339
Look, honey, this is not
the time to do anything

1277
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:00,341
but figure out
how to get free.

1278
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:03,121
We've been tied up all night.

1279
01:12:04,945 --> 01:12:07,890
May I have a moment
alone with Ian, please?

1280
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,892
Where do you
expect me to go, hon?

1281
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:12,603
Oh, I don't care.
Why don't you get in the shower

1282
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:14,605
and hum yourself
a little tune

1283
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:18,365
so I can have
a moment alone with him?

1284
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:25,230
Please.

1285
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:28,567
Fine.

1286
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:51,214
I love you, you fool.

1287
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:56,829
Okay, I understand that.

1288
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:00,819
"Okay, I understand that"?

1289
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:02,903
That is what you're gonna
say to me right now?

1290
01:13:03,003 --> 01:13:05,656
My wife's humming
in the shower.

1291
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:07,324
What do you
expect me to say?

1292
01:13:07,424 --> 01:13:09,827
Oh, Ian, I could have
dated anyone-

1293
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:11,879
anyone-

1294
01:13:11,978 --> 01:13:14,123
Fernando, the hot guy
from the gym;

1295
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:17,183
Dr. Cohen,
my dermatologist;

1296
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:19,253
Fred the bank guy-
anybody.

1297
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:20,971
But I chose you.

1298
01:13:21,070 --> 01:13:22,806
I know, I know.

1299
01:13:22,905 --> 01:13:25,009
You make me feel
smart and sexy

1300
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:27,428
And strong and beautiful.
I wanted to go to Paris with you

1301
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:29,263
and I want to spend
my life with you.

1302
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:31,932
And I don't think that just because
we're experiencing

1303
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:34,534
this little blip

1304
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:37,261
that anything
should change.

1305
01:13:40,332 --> 01:13:42,284
Yeah, you know,

1306
01:13:42,383 --> 01:13:45,529
I had a lot of
sorting out to do, Sara,

1307
01:13:45,629 --> 01:13:47,122
I'm sorry.

1308
01:13:47,221 --> 01:13:51,217
It's not so simple
anymore, okay?

1309
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:54,496
You're forgetting.
How could you forget?

1310
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:56,660
I'm not forgetting.

1311
01:13:56,759 --> 01:14:00,435
Please don't forget.

1312
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:04,021
Okay, it's been
more than a minute.

1313
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:09,428
Okay. Are you
feeling any calmer?

1314
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:12,780
No! This is
an absolute nightmare.

1315
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:15,642
I should have just gotten
on the plane to Paris

1316
01:14:15,742 --> 01:14:18,228
and gone alone.
- Yes, you should have.

1317
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:19,438
Louise, Louise.

1318
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:21,156
Shut up.

1319
01:14:21,255 --> 01:14:24,125
All right, all right.

1320
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:27,670
Listen, if Ian
truly loves you,

1321
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:30,157
he will come
to see that.

1322
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:33,494
And if he does,
I will be graceful about it

1323
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:35,803
and I will let him go.

1324
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:38,071
Okay?

1325
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:42,450
Okay.

1326
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:46,548
Okay, we've just gotta figure out
how the fuck to get out of here.

1327
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:49,051
My cell phone is
in my back pocket.

1328
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,719
If one of you guys
can reach it,

1329
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,959
maybe you can dial 911.

1330
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:06,193
Man: And you say you never
saw their faces?

1331
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:08,328
No, never.

1332
01:15:08,427 --> 01:15:10,614
And what was the name of
the lawn service that you normally use?

1333
01:15:10,714 --> 01:15:14,118
Mountain View Lawns.
I don't think it's those guys.

1334
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:16,620
There was a van
in the driveway,

1335
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,784
but it was unmarked.

1336
01:15:18,883 --> 01:15:20,207
Can you describe it to me?

1337
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:22,176
It was tan

1338
01:15:22,275 --> 01:15:24,894
and it had a lot of

1339
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:28,064
dirt and dust on it.

1340
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:29,967
That's all I remember.

1341
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:31,343
How many passenger seats?

1342
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:34,487
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't count

1343
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:37,474
because I didn't know
the house was being robbed.

1344
01:15:37,574 --> 01:15:40,618
Have you had
any contact in town

1345
01:15:40,718 --> 01:15:43,021
with anyone who asked you
questions about your house

1346
01:15:43,121 --> 01:15:44,523
or your schedule
or anything like that?

1347
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:46,900
No.
- No, not really, no.

1348
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,486
We really haven't had any contact
with anyone in town,

1349
01:15:49,586 --> 01:15:51,488
not for the 13 years
we've been up here, no.

1350
01:15:51,588 --> 01:15:53,490
Yeah, we've pretty much
kept to ourselves.

1351
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:57,260
I've only been
to the town once.

1352
01:15:57,427 --> 01:15:58,996
Now who are you?
Now what's the relationship?

1353
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:01,472
I'm his girlfriend.

1354
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:05,810
His mistress.
- Mm-hmm.

1355
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:09,506
We were supposed to go
to Paris this morning

1356
01:16:09,606 --> 01:16:13,427
where he may or may not
have been planning

1357
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:15,807
to ask me
to marry him.

1358
01:16:17,197 --> 01:16:18,982
Okay.

1359
01:16:19,081 --> 01:16:21,602
Has this kind of thing
ever happened before, Officer?

1360
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:24,271
I'm sure lots of people have had
affairs with much younger women.

1361
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:26,982
No, I mean a guy on a mower
robbing people

1362
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:29,234
who have vacation homes
up here.

1363
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:31,487
We had a string of robberies
a few years ago,

1364
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:33,822
but we caught the guy.
I've never really seen

1365
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:36,074
a robbery like this before.

1366
01:16:36,174 --> 01:16:38,827
Can you two come down to the station
later today and file a formal report

1367
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:41,121
of everything that's been taken?
- Yes, of course.

1368
01:16:41,221 --> 01:16:43,457
You really think you're gonna catch
these guys?

1369
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:45,342
It's hard to say.

1370
01:16:45,441 --> 01:16:47,544
You're not really giving us
much to go on.

1371
01:16:47,644 --> 01:16:50,130
There's a chance someone might
blab about it to a friend.

1372
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:51,798
We'll catch him that way.
Who knows?

1373
01:16:51,898 --> 01:16:53,634
Here's something
they overlooked.

1374
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:56,011
Wow.
- Your family's silverware.

1375
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:58,597
I can't believe
they didn't see that.

1376
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:00,140
God, that is so lucky.

1377
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,366
What a blessing.

1378
01:17:02,534 --> 01:17:05,395
Here's our station's address.
Come down at noon.

1379
01:17:05,495 --> 01:17:08,289
Yeah, we'll be there.

1380
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:11,667
Sorry this happened
to you folks.

1381
01:17:11,835 --> 01:17:13,153
Oh, thanks thanks.

1382
01:17:13,253 --> 01:17:15,197
We recommend locking
your doors securely.

1383
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:17,699
Oh, yes, we will.
We will.

1384
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:20,092
Okay, bye now.

1385
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:22,704
I can't believe
they took everything.

1386
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:24,706
They just took everything.

1387
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:27,850
Oh, Lou, I know, I know.

1388
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:33,564
It's okay.
We're alive.

1389
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:35,509
That's the important
thing, you know?

1390
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:37,603
Yeah?
- Yeah.

1391
01:17:37,702 --> 01:17:39,513
We're okay.
We're alive.

1392
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:41,682
And everything's gonna be okay.

1393
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:43,882
It's okay.

1394
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:46,853
They could have killed us.

1395
01:17:46,953 --> 01:17:48,855
We're just plain lucky
they didn't, Ian.

1396
01:17:48,955 --> 01:17:50,857
I know.
It's all gonna be okay.

1397
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:53,177
It's all
gonna be okay.

1398
01:17:56,546 --> 01:17:58,646
Goodbye.

1399
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:19,819
# My love and I were washed up at sea #

1400
01:18:19,986 --> 01:18:24,615
# And quietly
he looked at me #

1401
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:27,436
# And said,
"What do you need #

1402
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:31,330
# My love, my love? #

1403
01:18:31,498 --> 01:18:34,417
# What do you need?" #

1404
01:18:34,584 --> 01:18:39,672
# "Bring me 78 coconuts,"
said he #

1405
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:44,593
# "Bring me starry fish
from the sea #

1406
01:18:44,761 --> 01:18:47,096
# But most of all" #

1407
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:50,516
# Said my love #

1408
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:54,164
# "My love,
I need to be brave. " #

1409
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:58,691
Okay, Ruby.

1410
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:01,178
Shh, she's about
to go to sleep.

1411
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:04,738
I'll applaud with my
face then, okay?

1412
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:12,314
What time are
the movers coming?

1413
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:14,232
They said they'd be here
around 3:00.

1414
01:19:14,332 --> 01:19:16,777
I can't believe how easy it was
to sell this place.

1415
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:18,787
Yeah.

1416
01:19:18,886 --> 01:19:21,698
I'll be so happy
once we're out of this crazy house.

1417
01:19:21,798 --> 01:19:24,133
You're already happy.

1418
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:31,625
Okay, what was that for?

1419
01:19:31,725 --> 01:19:34,560
'Cause I love you.

1420
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:36,463
Hey, are you hungry?

1421
01:19:36,563 --> 01:19:38,632
Do you want to go into town
for one last lunch?

1422
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:40,759
Are you asking me out
on a date?

1423
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:42,436
I am.

1424
01:19:42,535 --> 01:19:45,722
I'm asking you and ruby
out on a family date.

1425
01:19:45,822 --> 01:19:48,574
Yeah, that'd be great.

1426
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:10,111
Hey.

1427
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:13,821
# Your eyes #

1428
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:17,825
# They're bright
as the moon #

1429
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:21,286
# That twinkles
in June #

1430
01:23:21,454 --> 01:23:25,749
# But only for me #

1431
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:28,111
# 'Cause you're
heaven-sent #

1432
01:23:28,211 --> 01:23:31,156
# You're the main event,
my love #

1433
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:33,356
# It's true #

1434
01:23:33,466 --> 01:23:36,510
# And I thank
my lucky stars #

1435
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:39,338
# For every day
with you. #
