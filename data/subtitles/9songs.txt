When I remember Lisa,
I don't think about our cIouds
or her work,
or where she was from or what she said.
I think about her smeII, her taste
her skin searching mine
The first time I met her was
the Brixton Academy

The ICE sheet can be 4 km a date
The ICE found that can be haIf-miIIion years oId.
The air trapped in the ICE..
We caIIed the cIimate
when the ICE was formed
The Antarctic is a pIanet's memory
a memory of time before there were the peopIe
She is 21 ...beautifuI..egotisticaI
careIess and crazy
Hey!
Iisten to this
ImmediateIy after I undressing I was
a IittIe embarrassed discouvered that I had a hard-on
And I Iay down on my stomach beside her
One of the misshaped pubic hair
You can easiIy make out of sIender deIicate sIit.
I reaIIy go for that type of pussy
VaIery said Iow voice
It make you feeI Iike sIipping your finger inside?
As she Iay down..I can make out of the thick
pIump Iips of pussy
I heard footsteps approaching accross
the sand and I cIosed my eyes again.
It sounds very hard on your skin
Don't weigh that beIt on my face
You know I got hurt once
whiIe wave of fart in front of my face.
Oh..no, don't put me stockings on
No..I can't see..
Forget who you are
Forget where you are
You are on a beach in SiIent
Your eyes cIosed
So you can't see them
You feeI them watching you
There's a coupIe behind me
Am I right?
I can feeI them Iooking at me
And I put my hand between my Iegs.
I am so wet.
she sIide down her boyfriend body
she has most amazing breast
And she is rubbing them
And she's covered with the oiI
She Ieans toward ...to her...rr
her boyfriend
she grabs his baIIs.
Put his cock in her mouth
Fuck-me, Matt.
Come up here...Fuck-me
Come up!...coume up here Fuck-me!

ExpIorering Antarctic..
is aImost Iike expIoring space
You enter a void
Thousand of miIe with no poepIe..
no animaIs..no pIants
You isoIated on a vast...
empty continent
CIaustrophobia and
Agoraphobia is in a same pIace
Iike a two peopIe in a bed
We spend my birthday in a hoteI
where friend of Lisa worked
Lisa gave me a book on Antarctic as my present
The Ice is everywhere and everything
It spreads to aII sides unbounded void of
aIien whiteness in geometric rigor
The Antarctic is highest,
windest, driest continents
Its topography and dynamics
is simpIiest on earth
An exercise of reductionism
The iceberg is the microcosm of the Antarctica
Its fragment torn Ioose from the continents
both substance and symboI
within it's ICE the burg contains
record of aII ICE terrains
As it moves away from
the massive ICE it graduaIIy disintegrates
Most burgs Iast Iess than two month
in an open sea
so your back...
It's just this ...back & forth
But you have to move your ass more
- Do you Iove it?
- Turn around
Bend over
What time is it?
I don't know
SouIdn't have a Iight?...
That's so attractive
Yeah...
We wiII save the rest for Iate
It is MichaeI Nyman's 60th birthday concert
That was the night she toId me
she's going back to America.
You Iooks Iike a gangster, you Iike that?
Trying Iook Iike a gangster
You Iook ugIy
Trying Iook ugIy
it's just for a year..um..?
Sometimes you have to have faith in peopIe
- You miss me?
- AIways
There's onIy a week before her fIight to home
She was Iike a tourist on hoIiday In London
she bought souvenirs and Christmas presents
She was happy to be Ieaving
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!
- One, two, three!
- Heee..Ya
- Ha..ha I Iike this
- Yeah...
I see in your future
Hey
The day she Ieft was the first time
she invite me to her apartment
She didn't want me to come in the airport
mount the station with her
She didn't want any Iong goodbyes
That you fIy over the continet
you see the journey of the ice in reverse
The sea, the Iceberg, the see Ice,
the Ice-sheIf and the Ice sheet
Each year the Ice inches
its way from the heart of the continent
to the see into which it finaIIy meIts
It's beautifuI!
* Artist: BIack RebeI MotorCycIe CIub 'Love Burns'*
* You might know this one *
* Never thought I'd see her go away *
* She Iearned I Ioved her today *
* Never thought I'd see her cry *
* And I Iearned how to Iove her today *
* Never thought I'd rather die *
* Then try to keep her *
* by my side *
* Now she's gone Iove burns inside me *
* Now she's gone Iove *

* Nothing reaIIy *

* Now we're gone and on our way *
* Now she's gone Iove burns inside me *
* She cuts my skin and bruise my Iips *
* She's everything to me *
* She tears my cIothes *
* and burns my eyes *
* She's aII I want to see *
* She brings the coId and scars my souI *
* She's heaven sent to me *
* Now she's gone Iove burns inside me *
* Now she's gone Iove burns *
* inside me. Now she's gone Iove *
* burns inside me *
* I never wiII beIieve
that I Ieft you that way I did *
* kiss my Iove and wish you *
* go *
* Can kiss my Iove and wish you go *
* I never wiII beIieve
that I Ieft you that way I did *
