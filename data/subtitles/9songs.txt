* Forgot that he had wrecked a girI *

391
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:57,132
* Sometimes these eyes *

392
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,499
* forget the face they're peering from *

393
00:50:01,633 --> 00:50:03,965
* when the face they peer upon *

394
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,132

397
00:50:15,133 --> 00:50:17,432
* She can return you the face *

398
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:20,332

424
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,632
ExpIorering Antarctic..

425
00:52:43,633 --> 00:52:45,132
is aImost Iike expIoring space

426
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:47,165
You enter a void

427
00:52:47,866 --> 00:52:49,765
Thousand of miIe with no poepIe..

428
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:51,732
no animaIs..no pIants

429
00:52:52,433 --> 00:52:54,099
You isoIated on a vast...

430
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,465
empty continent

431
00:52:55,466 --> 00:52:58,099
CIaustrophobia and
Agoraphobia is in a same pIace

432
00:52:59,533 --> 00:53:01,265
Iike a two peopIe in a bed

433
00:54:01,233 --> 00:54:05,399
We spend my birthday in a hoteI
where friend of Lisa worked

434
00:54:09,033 --> 00:54:11,599
Lisa gave me a book on Antarctic as my present

435
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,032
The Ice is everywhere and everything

436
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:21,799
It spreads to aII sides unbounded void of

437
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,932
aIien whiteness in geometric rigor

438
00:54:24,733 --> 00:54:28,065
The Antarctic is highest,
windest, driest continents

439
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:31,232
Its topography and dynamics
is simpIiest on earth

440
00:54:31,233 --> 00:54:33,165
An exercise of reductionism

441
00:54:38,266 --> 00:54:40,832
The iceberg is the microcosm of the Antarctica

442
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:45,232
Its fragment torn Ioose from the continents
both substance and symboI

443
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:49,199
within it's ICE the burg contains
record of aII ICE terrains

444
00:54:49,733 --> 00:54:52,865
As it moves away from
the massive ICE it graduaIIy disintegrates

445
00:54:53,933 --> 00:54:56,365
Most burgs Iast Iess than two month
in an open sea

446
00:55:04,133 --> 00:55:05,865
so your back...

447
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,099
It's just this ...back & forth

448
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,265
But you have to move your ass more

449
00:55:24,266 --> 00:55:25,999
- Do you Iove it?
- Turn around

450
00:55:26,666 --> 00:55:27,799
Bend over

451
00:55:31,733 --> 00:55:32,932
What time is it?

452
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:34,365
I don't know

453
00:55:35,866 --> 00:55:37,232
SouIdn't have a Iight?...

454
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:45,632
That's so attractive

455
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,832
Yeah...

456
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:52,165
We wiII save the rest for Iate

457
00:55:54,733 --> 00:55:57,299
It is MichaeI Nyman's 60th birthday concert

458
00:56:41,466 --> 00:56:43,599
That was the night she toId me
she's going back to America.

459
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,265
You Iooks Iike a gangster, you Iike that?

460
00:56:49,633 --> 00:56:51,332
Trying Iook Iike a gangster

461
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,765
You Iook ugIy

462
00:56:59,233 --> 00:57:00,665
Trying Iook ugIy

463
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:04,732
it's just for a year..um..?

464
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,899
Sometimes you have to have faith in peopIe

465
00:57:48,233 --> 00:57:50,699
- You miss me?
- AIways

466
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,432
There's onIy a week before her fIight to home

467
01:00:09,433 --> 01:00:11,632
She was Iike a tourist on hoIiday In London

468
01:00:12,133 --> 01:00:14,365
she bought souvenirs and Christmas presents

469
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,132
She was happy to be Ieaving

470
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:21,565
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!

471
01:00:21,866 --> 01:00:23,132
- One, two, three!
- Heee..Ya

472
01:00:25,033 --> 01:00:26,632
- Ha..ha I Iike this
- Yeah...

473
01:00:26,633 --> 01:00:28,899
I see in your future

474
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,565
Hey

475
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:40,965
The day she Ieft was the first time
she invite me to her apartment

476
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:45,132
She didn't want me to come in the airport
mount the station with her

477
01:00:45,866 --> 01:00:47,499
She didn't want any Iong goodbyes

478
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:21,799
That you fIy over the continet
you see the journey of the ice in reverse

479
01:01:22,133 --> 01:01:24,599
The sea, the Iceberg, the see Ice,

480
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,032
the Ice-sheIf and the Ice sheet

481
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,932
Each year the Ice inches
its way from the heart of the continent

482
01:01:30,933 --> 01:01:33,399
to the see into which it finaIIy meIts

483
01:01:39,933 --> 01:01:41,165
It's beautifuI!

484
01:01:57,433 --> 01:01:58,965
* Artist: BIack RebeI MotorCycIe CIub 'Love Burns'*
* You might know this one *

485
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:28,199
* Never thought I'd see her go away *

486
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,465
* She Iearned I Ioved her today *

487
01:02:31,466 --> 01:02:35,465
