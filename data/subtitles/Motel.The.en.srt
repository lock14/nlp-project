1
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,690
THE EMPTY HOURS

2
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,290
Sebas! I'm glad you made it.

3
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,400
What's up. Uncle Gerry?

4
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,960
- How are your mother and sister?
- They're well, thanks

5
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,000
I asked you to come here because
I need someone I can trust,

6
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,840
to look after my place.

7
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,180
It will be a good experience for you.

8
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,150
and you'll earn a bit of money

9
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,310
In that case. I'm all for it

10
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,050
All this shit with the medica
check ups and lab tests

11
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,280
is going to take a couple of weeks

12
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,860
Maybe more, maybe less,
it depends on what the doctors say.

13
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,130
Don't you worry Uncle.
I'll stay as long as it takes.

14
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,100
I left everything
settled in Jalapa anyway.

15
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,630
That's great, son.

16
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,530
The clothes lines are here

17
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,640
and the laundry sink is there.

18
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,110
Room number 9,
where my truck is, is not for rent

19
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,110
Why not?

20
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,720
It's full of paint cans,
cement and other stuff

21
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,150
I was fixing up the motel a bit.

22
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,120
but it will have to wait
because of this medical stuff

23
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,920
When I get back, I'm going
to change some roof tiles

24
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,730
and add some over here

25
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:00,430
I'm going to pull out some diseased palms
and paint the place.

26
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,400
I must get it looking ship-shape.

27
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,270
This is the linen cupboard,

28
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,180
where cleaning products are also kept

29
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,720
You have to keep it locked
or things get lost.

30
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,820
Lucha. The laundrywoman,
never notifies when she'll be coming,

31
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,520
but she is very dependable.

32
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,180
Does she do the cleaning?

33
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,190
No. She only washes and irons.

34
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,260
I had to fire the maid a few days ago

35
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,000
The night-watchman said
he would find someone else

36
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:39,470
If she doesn't come today.
you'll have to do the cleaning yourself

37
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,080
- I'm here to look after the motel
- Look...

38
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,770
to manage a hotel.
you have to do a bit of everything

39
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,820
It will only be for a few days.

40
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,920
The rooms are a very similar.

41
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,520
Change the sheets and towels each time.

42
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,820
And make sure that there is always
a box of paper handkerchiefs by the bed

43
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,930
Ok

44
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,460
This little drum is for beers.

45
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,830
sodas, condoms or whatever they need

46
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,740
You put the stuff out here

47
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,680
and turn it. So you don't bother them.

48
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,220
The most important thing
in this business is discretion.

49
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,590
Don't worry.

50
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,930
Well. Sebas...

51
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,190
I'm leaving you in charge of my motel.

52
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,430
- Don't fool around too much...
- No, of course not

53
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,800
Do be careful,

54
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,110
there's some crazy dudes round here

55
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,240
I can look after myself

56
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,540
Really, son,

57
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,480
the situation is rough.

58
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,180
- Let me know how things are going.
- Sure

59
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,580
Yes, Sir.

60
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,110
They are single story houses.

61
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:40,210
They have two bedrooms, a dining
room area with an open kitchen

62
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,850
It's a compound with nine houses

63
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,330
with a shared swimming pool

64
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,020
They also have access to the beach.

65
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,960
Yes, they are very nice

66
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,460
Very nice.

67
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,630
Why don't you come to see them?

68
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,180
Yes.

69
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,570
I'll show you the house
and explain our financing options.

70
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,100
Yes?

71
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,540
Perfect

72
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,240
Hold on

73
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,370
Coconuts?

74
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,480
What'll you have, dude?

75
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,810
This one.

76
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,190
That one?

77
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,980
Hold on. Dude, I'll put a straw in

78
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,450
Here's a ten

79
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,670
Do you have any change?

80
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,710
haven't got any.

81
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,650
Better take another one

82
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,880
No. One is enough

83
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,560
What'll we do then? Don't have change.

84
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,160
Let's flip a coin.

85
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,200
If you win I'll give you
the coconut for free

86
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:42,230
But if I win I get to keep the change.

87
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,670
Oh yeah?

88
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,110
Hold on

89
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,400
All set. Dude.

90
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,310
Do come back.

91
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,540
The key?

92
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,650
I'm sorry

93
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,790
What?
Are we going to flip that coin or not?

94
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,660
You're on

95
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,160
- What?
- You flip it

96
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,370
Heads

97
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,190
Tough luck!

98
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,670
It's heads

99
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,030
It's tails, my friend

100
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,500
Tails? No way

101
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,870
- It's tails
- Don't cheat

102
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,530
Me? I'm playing fair.

103
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,740
- You're playing fair?
- Yes

104
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,050
Come on.

105
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,580
What's your name?

106
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,350
Jacinto

107
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,410
At your service

108
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,280
- How old are you?
- Twelve.

109
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,520
- See you
- I'll be back for my other coconut.

110
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,160
Yes, bye

111
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,820
- Good afternoon!
- Hello.

112
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,510
I'm sorry but this room is not available.

113
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,860
But the porch is vacant

114
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,330
True, but it isn't fit for rent.

115
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,430
So, what do we do now?

116
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,260
- We can do it right here
- No way.

117
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,660
- You're so boring!
- It's not that

118
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,940
The rest are all available

119
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,540
Is that one next door vacant?

120
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,010
Room 10, yes it is.

121
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,710
That one then

122
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,350
I'll bring your key straight away. Sorry.

123
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,660
I like this place

124
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,370
What?

125
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,770
I like this little motel.

126
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,270
It has charm.

127
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,280
It's very different from the last one

128
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,240
Didn't you like the last one?

129
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,020
Not really.

130
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,420
It was quite decadent

131
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,220
And what about the smell...

132
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,230
Yuck Don't remind me!

133
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,070
Well. If you want
we could meet at your work

134
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,970
It's a bit far for me but.

135
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,940
No

136
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,710
I've already said I don't want that.

137
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,270
You're right.

138
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,820
The truth is this place isn't bad at all.

139
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,610
Simple. No luxuries.

140
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,650
but worth it

141
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,690
And it's very discreet.

142
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,330
Far from everything.

143
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,030
Maybe this way
we could meet more often?

144
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,760
Miranda. Don't start

145
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,070
I'm just saying it
because nobody knows you here.

146
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,920
I'm going to shower.

147
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,010
Miranda? Are the towels out there?

148
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,660
I can't see any here

149
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,010
No

150
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,190
Reception.

151
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,290
I'll bring them in a moment

152
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,100
Yes.

153
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,400
Better pass them through here.

154
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,910
- Sorry. The maid didn't show today
- Don't worry, thanks.

155
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,360
Here are the towels.

156
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,200
Are you ready, Miranda?

157
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,970
I'll take you out for seafood

158
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,570
- Hi
- Good afternoon

159
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,530
- Mr Severino?
- Yes

160
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,300
I am Sebastian, Gerardo's nephew.

161
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,270
Pleased to meet you

162
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,240
- Can I help you?
- No thanks, I'll take care of it.

163
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,710
Feeling hungry?

164
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,150
A bit, yes.

165
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,950
- It looks as though it might rain
- Yes.

166
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,620
As the song says, 'It looks like rain,

167
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,590
the sky is turning grey.'

168
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,130
- Is that your dog?
- Yes

169
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,430
- What's its name?
- Bodoque

170
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,140
- I'll be inside. If you need anything...
- Alright

171
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,840
I'll call you if I need something.

172
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,140
Thank you.

173
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,690
Come here, Bodo

174
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,860
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

175
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,560
- The motel seems quite full tonight.
- Yes

176
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,040
After partying in Tecolutla,
they came here. So it filled up

177
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,740
It's not full every day but it's full now.

178
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,180
Look

179
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:55,510
my uncle said that you
were going to find a new maid

180
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,680
- Didn't she come?
- No

181
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,880
wonder what happened.

182
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,750
But...

183
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,350
don't worry, she'll come tomorrow.

184
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,690
Could we find someone else?
I need someone urgently

185
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,860
Melinda will come tomorrow

186
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,500
- Make sure that she does
- Don't worry

187
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,140
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

188
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,950
Santa Lucia Condominiums.

189
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,250
Good morning Sir, how are you?

190
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,390
Well

191
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,050
I have a client interested
in house number 3.

192
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,780
No... number 4

193
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,280
Yes.

194
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,900
He said that he'd let me know this week

195
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,730
I would be delighted too!

196
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,010
I've advertised all over the place

197
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,210
But things are slow.

198
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,750
People lack funds
and banks are making it very difficult.

199
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,750
Yes, of course.

200
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,460
No. I gave my word

201
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:14,060
I gave my word and won't leave
until the condo is sold

202
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,970
Don't worry.

203
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,880
Even if I have to stay another two months.

204
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,350
Hello?

205
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,050
Are we on for today?

206
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,520
I called you several times.

207
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,990
Yes. I know that being
a manager and family man

208
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:21,070
Leaves you with little time
for other things

209
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,870
Just kidding

210
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,710
Can you make it?

211
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,050
Are you sure?

212
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,620
We can leave it for another day...

213
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,950
So we'll meet over there directly?

214
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,730
At 2 o'clock. As usual?

215
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,200
Look at you!

216
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,840
You must be young Sebastian

217
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,840
- Lucha?
- At your service

218
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,010
Have you been here long?

219
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,950
I arrived a little while ago
but I didn't want to bother you

220
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,120
Did you notice anything strange?

221
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,820
Strange in what way?

222
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,790
Like people trying to get into the rooms.

223
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,090
Don't worry young man.

224
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,100
nothing ever happens here.

225
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,630
Well. I'll be at the reception
if you need me

226
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,600
Alright

227
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,400
- Excuse me
- Bye.

228
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,310
Hello?

229
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,280
Hello?

230
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,910
What's up. Uncle Gerry?

231
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,820
What?

232
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,620
Hello?

233
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,630
I can barely hear you.

234
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,360
Hello?

235
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,330
Can you hear me better?

236
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,130
Can you hear me?

237
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,570
Hello?

238
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,070
Ok. I can hear you over here.

239
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,510
No. Wait

240
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,580
Hello?

241
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,750
Yes, I hear you now

242
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,880
What's up?

243
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:56,860
Hello?

244
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,040
What's up. Man?

245
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,610
I'm back

246
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:26,080
- How did it go, son?
- Good.

247
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,260
I've got to go now.

248
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,190
- Have you ironed everything?
- Just left some sheets.

249
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,530
It looks like rain,
could you bring them in later?

250
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,730
Yes, I'll take care of it.

251
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,100
I'm off then, bye.

252
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:02,780
Lucha?

253
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:08,080
Could you help me out
until I can find a new maid?

254
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,510
No. I can't.

255
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:12,810
I only come here
as a favor to Mr Gerardo.

256
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:16,750
I work full-time at another hotel
so don't have the time

257
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,560
- It would just be for a few days.
- Honestly, I can't.

258
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:25,030
But I'll see if I can find you
a reliable hardworking girl.

259
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,730
- Please do.
- Don't worry. I'll find you one

260
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,080
Good afternoon.

261
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,430
Thanks

262
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,470
No. Leave it open

263
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,900
so my partner can see I'm already here.

264
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,410
Thanks

265
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,350
Sorry to bother you.

266
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,850
Fetching the sheets. It started to pour

267
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,020
You can wait here
There's no point in getting wet.

268
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,260
Aren't you too young to be working here?

269
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,200
It's my uncle's motel.

270
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,880
He had to leave so I'm replacing him.

271
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,670
Just for a few days, until he gets back.

272
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,780
That's very bold of him,

273
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,580
leaving you here alone
when you're so young.

274
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,580
Maybe

275
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,680
but I'm not all that young...

276
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,220
You can't be over 16. Right?

277
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,730
I'm turning 18 in three months

278
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,460
I almost got it.

279
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,220
So, what's it like here?

280
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,150
- What?
- Here

281
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,660
Boring

282
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:09,960
There isn't much to do.

283
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,570
You must find out all sorts of stuff...

284
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,460
I'd rather not meddle.

285
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,140
But you must wonder
who the people who come here are.

286
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,100
Like those guys over there

287
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,650
I bet he's a young guy from around here.

288
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,880
Well. He did look young

289
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,920
About 21 or 22?

290
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,090
More or less.

291
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:44,250
I bet it's his first time in a motel

292
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,560
He didn't look like a first-timer.

293
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:48,740
Really?

294
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:52,140
The plot thickens.

295
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,400
- The girl looked...
- Don't tell me that

296
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,330
Better tell me

297
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,150
what car they drive.

298
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,980
They were riding a motorbike

299
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,310
A small motorbike

300
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,280
That makes it easier

301
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,750
she's a hooker he picked up.

302
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,630
No?

303
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,960
Don't tell me they're engaged!

304
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,170
How disappointing!

305
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,940
I didn't expect them to be so banal

306
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,310
So what?

307
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,140
So ordinary

308
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,780
So boring

309
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,190
They didn't look
as though they were bored

310
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,720
Not while their passion lasts,
but that is temporary

311
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,980
Look. A ray of sunshine.

312
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,180
Excuse me.

313
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,490
Hello?

314
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,780
What's up. Mom?

315
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,290
What?

316
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,660
I can barely hear you.

317
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,460
Hold on. Don't hang up.

318
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,160
Any news of my uncle?

319
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,970
You don't say...

320
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,010
Calm down. Mom...

321
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:37,940
You know what my uncle's like

322
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,490
And what did the doctors say?

323
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,600
So when are they going
to do the new lab tests?

324
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,690
What's up with the maid?

325
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:19,520
She hasn't come.

326
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,960
I'll try to get another one tomorrow

327
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:27,400
Because Ms Melinda didn't show.

328
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:30,870
You've been saying that
since the other day!

329
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:35,830
It's hard to find someone
who is reliable and trustworthy

330
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:37,670
- You already said that
- Yes.

331
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:39,440
My uncle asked you...

332
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,450
I'm doing the cleaning myself...

333
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:44,320
- Tough luck
- What do you mean?

334
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:47,250
- Nothing can be done
- What do you mean?

335
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:51,410
Well. There just isn't anybody
who is reliable and trustworthy

336
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:54,060
You were asked
to take care of it days ago!

337
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:55,820
I know, I'm telling you!

338
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,090
You're telling me?

339
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,160
I'll be right back.

340
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,740
The building is over 300 ft2

341
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,390
plus another 100 ft2 of private garden,

342
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:04,180
not to mention the swimming pool
and the beach access

343
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:09,820
I truly believe it's one
of the best deals in the area.

344
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,190
The master bedroom.

345
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,300
which also has two built-in double beds.

346
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:19,900
Over there

347
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:23,570
is a large and comfortable bathroom.
you can go in.

348
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:28,500
And this is the kitchen

349
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,410
There's quite a large space
for a pantry over here.

350
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:34,050
It is very versatile.

351
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:36,690
you can adapt it to your needs

352
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,920
The open plan
is very practical and functional,

353
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:42,390
and gives the house a very nice touch.

354
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,670
The whole house is going to smell of food

355
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,180
MAID WANTED

356
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:56,860
Hello!

357
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,060
Hi, Mario

358
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,410
I just wanted to say
that I'll be waiting for you

359
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:51,300
Don't be long.

360
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,970
Hello?

361
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,210
I can barely hear you.

362
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:25,100
Hold on

363
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:26,710
Wait a moment

364
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,820
Yes, I can hear you better.

365
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,960
What's up?

366
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:47,300
You're with Uncle Gerry?

367
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,670
And what did they say?

368
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:57,910
What?

369
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,240
Yes, a truck drove by.

370
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,610
I know what I'm doing.

371
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,830
Just relax and look after my uncle

372
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,930
Don't worry, everything is fine

373
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:05,780
Are you ok?

374
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:09,320
Yes.

375
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,780
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you

376
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:14,250
Don't worry,

377
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,320
I'll get your key

378
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,350
Relax, I'm not in a hurry

379
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:54,850
Coming!

380
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,660
Impatient horny bastards!

381
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:14,180
Hello

382
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,280
Thanks

383
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,700
- You shouldn't have
- It was my fault you got dirty

384
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,040
You'll never guess!

385
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,510
- What?
- About the clients.

386
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:49,310
You're on

387
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,720
First clue

388
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:54,050
They arrived in a brand new pickup

389
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,990
He must be a well off cattle rancher.

390
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:02,500
around 50 or 55, right?

391
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,230
Yes, to the rancher.

392
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:07,590
And he brought his secretary...

393
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:10,300
25 years old

394
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,630
Ranchers don't have secretaries.

395
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:15,340
But you got the age right

396
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:21,010
Some table dancer?

397
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:23,620
No?

398
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:28,750
I give up.

399
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,760
Let's say they have a lot in common.

400
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:35,750
Then she's his wife. No?

401
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:38,250
Or girlfriend, or lover.

402
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:39,360
That's right...

403
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:43,200
but they have something specific.

404
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,270
What do you mean?

405
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:46,600
You've lost me.

406
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:50,000
I'll make it easy

407
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:54,110
they play for the other team

408
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:02,720
They're gay!

409
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:06,080
You got it

410
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,660
Here's your prize

411
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:10,800
Thanks

412
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:15,020
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- No, go ahead

413
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,890
My name's Miranda. What's yours?

414
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,320
Sebastian Ramirez Novoa, at your service.

415
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:44,330
Pleased to meet you. Mr. Ramirez Novoa.

416
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:49,230
Are you from round here?

417
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,670
No. I'm from Jalapa

418
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:05,170
A girlfriend?

419
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,150
I'm so nosy, aren't?

420
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:12,790
Since you're in on other peoples' privacy,

421
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:16,620
it seemed ok to ask you.
but you don't have to answer...

422
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,660
No. Don't worry.

423
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,230
Well. I do have a friend. But...

424
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:25,940
she isn't my girlfriend

425
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:29,540
So you just kiss and stuff?

426
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:34,080
Yes.

427
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,710
But she left

428
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,480
Why?

429
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,920
Because she met another guy

430
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:46,720
You were too slow...

431
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:50,300
Find another one then!

432
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,660
Love comes and goes.

433
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:54,330
Right

434
00:57:58,770 --> 00:57:59,740
How about you?

435
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:03,200
Me?

436
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,510
My thing isn't at all serious

437
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:10,420
I missed the marriage train

438
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:14,740
To be honest.
I was never looking for that.

439
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:18,820
It's difficult in my line of work.

440
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:20,150
I travel a lot

441
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,950
I'm like a sailor.

442
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,860
a man in every port

443
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,630
It's better that way

444
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:36,010
I get the good part

445
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:37,440
the compliments. The fun

446
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:42,770
I don't get the jealousy
or the routine or the complaints.

447
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:46,750
Do you see him often?

448
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:51,460
Enough

449
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:56,600
I'm sorry. Didn't mean to pry

450
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,090
No. Don't worry.

451
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:03,970
What bothers me is his lack of.

452
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:08,440
He can never be on time

453
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,110
I've been waiting for him for an hour

454
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,940
I always have to wait.

455
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:22,320
The king of waiting. I'm going to my room.

456
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:47,880
Hello?

457
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:49,880
Hello?

458
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:52,220
Hello?

459
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:54,020
Mario?

460
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:55,660
Hello?

461
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:00,190
Where are you?

462
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,630
And why didn't you let me know earlier?

463
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,540
I've been waiting for you
for over an hour!

464
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:17,440
Do you recall that I cancelled
an appointment to see you?

465
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:23,150
No, I'm an idiot because I knew
you were going to do this to me.

466
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:27,720
Tonight?

467
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,550
Come off it, Mario.

468
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:36,520
No. I've got tons of things to do.

469
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:47,670
Are you sure you can make it?

470
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:50,470
What about Silvia?

471
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:58,110
No. You know what? I can't

472
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:00,280
I'm busy too

473
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:15,370
It's on the house.

474
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,100
- No way.
- Please

475
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:21,370
Ok

476
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:25,780
Thanks

477
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:19,910
Another margarita?

478
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,350
- Ok.
- Coming up

479
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:23,730
Thanks

480
01:04:16,450 --> 01:04:17,920
Open!

481
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:21,220
Fucking Mario!

482
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:34,830
- Good evening.
- Good evening. Miss

483
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:36,260
Please follow me

484
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,860
I'm not here for a room

485
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:39,620
I came to see the young man

486
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:41,430
- Young Sebastian?
- Yes.

487
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,870
I'll let him know

488
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,030
Thank you.

489
01:06:14,030 --> 01:06:16,800
I thought there would be
more clients at night.

490
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,100
It depends on the day.

491
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:22,410
But they are definitely ouder at night.

492
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:24,970
I can imagine.

493
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:28,510
Hey...

494
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:31,380
what about going out for some fun?

495
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:34,120
- Right now?
- Sure!

496
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,860
I know a place that has a great vibes.

497
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:41,460
It's on me.

498
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:47,920
Cheers.

499
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:04,250
- Let's dance
- No.

500
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,250
Come on.

501
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:07,410
- Please.
- No. I don't dance.

502
01:07:07,950 --> 01:07:11,480
You should ask those pretty young girls

503
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:13,450
I'm sure they would be delighted.

504
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:14,620
- Come on...
- No.

505
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:16,320
Go on. Ask them.

506
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:17,690
Ask them.

507
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,860
I'll cheer you on from here

508
01:07:59,010 --> 01:07:59,840
The same

509
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:31,070
One tequila.

510
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,480
Cheers.

511
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:44,530
No. I don't want to leave.

512
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:45,770
Please, let's go.

513
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:23,650
Where should I take you?

514
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,380
I love you. Mario

515
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:25,820
- What did you say your name was?
- Maria

516
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:29,290
The clotheslines are here
and the laundry is just beyond

517
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,630
The motel has ten rooms.
They're all similar.

518
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,000
- We clean them as soon as they're vacant
- Ok

519
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,170
I'll show you one of the rooms

520
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:43,840
You always have to change
the sheets and towels

521
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:46,470
Put the soiled ones in the storage room

522
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:50,450
Lucha takes care of washing and ironing.

523
01:14:51,550 --> 01:14:52,680
What else?

524
01:14:53,420 --> 01:14:55,720
Always leave
paper handkerchiefs next to the bed.

525
01:14:55,890 --> 01:14:59,020
I'll show you where
the cleaning products are.

526
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:00,850
If you run out, I'll buy more

527
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:03,030
- Any questions?
- No. Sir

528
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:09,000
The most important thing, Maria.

529
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:12,100
is to be very discreet with the clients

530
01:15:12,770 --> 01:15:14,860
Alright. Sir, don't worry

531
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:37,820
Here. Sir.

532
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,660
I found this on the floor

533
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,470
- Where?
- Room number 10.

534
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:46,960
- Thank you
- You're welcome, Sir.

535
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:25,210
Hey...

536
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:28,070
have you worked in a motel before?

537
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:29,480
No

538
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:31,810
Don't worry, it's very simple.

539
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:34,280
Hardly anyone comes here anyway.

540
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:45,760
The only trouble is when clients are drunk

541
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:48,500
and they make a mess in the rooms

542
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:55,400
And there's also the groups
that come in to have orgies

543
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,140
They leave a lot of work for us!

544
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:07,740
I'll be right back.

545
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:17,380
I've come to apologize

546
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:22,220
I'm so embarrassed
I don't know what came over me.

547
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,190
I even ruined your date.

548
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:26,960
It wasn't anything

549
01:18:27,130 --> 01:18:28,220
Of course it was

550
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,000
Did you get her phone number?

551
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:37,470
I think it would have worked out well.

552
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,070
I got really wasted,

553
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,150
I even lost my phone.

554
01:18:53,530 --> 01:18:54,720
Thanks a lot!

555
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:59,190
I was so worried. I have many
important contacts and I didn't...

556
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:01,600
What?

557
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:36,650
Look. A mermaid

558
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:40,630
That stain up there,

559
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:43,460
looks ike a mermaid.

560
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:48,970
No

561
01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:53,640
It looks more like...

562
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:56,710
an iguana, doesn't it?

563
01:20:57,950 --> 01:20:59,380
An iguana?

564
01:21:00,650 --> 01:21:01,480
No way.

565
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:04,650
An iguana and a mermaid
have nothing in common.

566
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:08,180
I can't see the mermaid

567
01:21:08,590 --> 01:21:09,560
Come on.

568
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:12,520
Come over here to look at it

569
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:15,230
Come on.

570
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:18,790
Look

571
01:21:19,610 --> 01:21:21,370
Up there, see?

572
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,040
In the corner

573
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:30,420
No?

574
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,850
Down there, see it?

575
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:36,180
That thing

576
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:38,150
is the fish tail.

577
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:40,590
Then above

578
01:21:41,690 --> 01:21:43,160
that's her hair

579
01:21:43,330 --> 01:21:46,020
And those two spots are her tits

580
01:21:48,230 --> 01:21:49,220
Got it now?

581
01:21:52,870 --> 01:21:55,360
If that's a mermaid then I'm...

582
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:56,970
What?

583
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:01,410
A handsome stud like...

584
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:02,810
What? An iguana?

585
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:28,130
Don't you have to get that?

586
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:32,040
No. The maid can go.

587
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:39,480
It doesn't sound as though she's going

588
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:47,890
Well. Have to get going anyway.

589
01:25:30,890 --> 01:25:31,860
Hello?

590
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:35,790
Maria? This is Sebastian,
from the Palma Real Motel

591
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:38,290
Are you coming in today? You're late

592
01:25:40,770 --> 01:25:43,100
Why? You and I had reached an agreement

593
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:49,100
Just tell your husband
it's a job like any other

594
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:52,400
I'm not shouting at you, I'm just saying

595
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:54,270
Hello?

596
01:25:56,210 --> 01:25:57,310
Shit!

597
01:29:10,010 --> 01:29:11,200
How's tricks?

598
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:30,620
Why are you running off?

599
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:32,850
How much will you give me?

600
01:29:34,270 --> 01:29:35,930
One peso for each one

601
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:38,530
Oh yeah?

602
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:41,800
Better give me every
third coconut you bring down.

603
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:47,540
- Yes or no?
- Ok.

604
01:29:54,850 --> 01:29:56,720
Watch your head. Dude.

605
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:58,490
Send them down.

606
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:02,120
Come on, I'll catch them down here

607
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,370
These are enough to set up my stand

608
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:31,710
What can I do for you?

609
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,840
We're here to deliver mattresses.

610
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:36,750
- I didn't order anything
- Look

611
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,550
The purchase was made

612
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:41,050
by Mr Gerardo Novoa Sanchez

613
01:32:41,650 --> 01:32:42,750
about a month ago.

614
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:46,090

- We put them back there

630
01:34:10,710 --> 01:34:11,680
Good afternoon.

631
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:15,410
I saw you were looking for a maid.

632
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:16,840
So I came in.

633
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:20,750
Yes. Yes I am...

634
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:24,010
There are 10 rooms...

635
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:26,150
well 9 actually.

636
01:34:27,330 --> 01:34:29,990
They're all the same
So there isn't much to do.

637
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:33,690
I've just received new mattresses,
that's why it's such a mess.

638
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:35,890
- Can I help you?
- No, don't worry

639
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:37,260
Why not? Come on

640
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:40,130
Ok. Thanks.

641
01:34:43,070 --> 01:34:45,240
Careful, it's a bit heavy

642
01:34:54,490 --> 01:34:56,080
- Thanks
- You're welcome.

643
01:34:57,290 --> 01:34:59,780
- I'll show you the rest of the motel.
- Ok.

644
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,120
- After you

645
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:05,460
This is the reception.

646
01:35:05,630 --> 01:35:08,960
And that's the storage room
with the cleaning products

647
01:35:09,130 --> 01:35:10,620
My name is Sebastian

648
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:13,430
