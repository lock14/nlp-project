this is going to be a riot</i>

00:00:37,418 --> 00:00:39,618
<i>I don't read
the news papers</i>

4
00:00:39,913 --> 00:00:42,246

7
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:52,236
<i>Bring it on</i>

start to frown</i>

<i>It's sword and gun day</i>

00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:24,854

00:01:39,983 --> 00:01:41,317
<i>What time is it?</i>

19
00:01:42,207 --> 00:01:44,940

00:03:13,095 --> 00:03:14,428
Nice ride.

44
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:16,981
It does the job.

45
00:03:17,551 --> 00:03:20,151
What job,
delivering pizzas?

46
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:24,165
Well, it's not the ride,
it's the rider.

47
00:03:28,615 --> 00:03:30,015
What the hell
was that?

48
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,307
What?

49
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:34,759
Hey!
You talking to my girl?

50
00:03:34,656 --> 00:03:36,856
Oh, shit. Here we go.
Yeah.

51
00:03:36,474 --> 00:03:39,541
She was just
admiring my ride.

52
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:40,885
"My ride. "

53
00:03:41,283 --> 00:03:42,883
My grandma's Buick
could smoke

54
00:03:43,922 --> 00:03:45,855
that piece of shit,
trailer trash.

55
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,719
Well, what about
your daddy's Viper?

56
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,395
This beast's
got 500 horsepower

57
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,573
and a Borla exhaust system.

58
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,666
It does 0 to 60
in like 4.3 seconds...

59
00:03:54,144 --> 00:03:56,144
That's about right.
That's about right. Yeah.

60
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:58,367
Wow.
You can read the brochure.

61
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:18,733
What a pitch, baby.
What a pitch. I like that.

62
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:20,933
What's he gonna do?

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,933
Let's make it happen.
Bring it.

64
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,867
I got your...
I got your back.

65
00:04:42,747 --> 00:04:45,414
Why don't you nice boys
let your cars do the talking?

66
00:04:47,331 --> 00:04:49,465
I only race
for pink slips.

67
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,356
This car goes for 80 grand.

68
00:04:52,355 --> 00:04:55,422
What would I do with a broken-ass
piece of shit like that?

69
00:04:59,723 --> 00:05:01,256
How about me?

70
00:05:04,563 --> 00:05:08,230
Winner gets me.

71
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:18,096
Cut it, let's cut it.
Let's go, go, go, go!

72
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,300
Blast-off, baby!

73
00:05:37,756 --> 00:05:39,822
First one out
the other side...

74
00:05:42,572 --> 00:05:45,038
It's time.
Let's go!

75
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:46,561
Ready, boys? Make it interesting, Clay.

76
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:30,302
Shit!

77
00:06:34,017 --> 00:06:35,151
Yeah!

78
00:07:52,808 --> 00:07:54,408
I thought
you loved me.

79
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,107
Oh, well.

80
00:08:14,951 --> 00:08:16,418
What the hell?

81
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:28,633
Guess I got
a new date for prom.

82
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,670
Clay, stop the car!
Shut up!

83
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:50,533
Clay, stop the car!

84
00:08:51,326 --> 00:08:52,326
Shut up!

85
00:08:52,622 --> 00:08:53,889
Stop it!

86
00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:59,822
Clay, please stop!
Please stop!

87
00:10:10,454 --> 00:10:12,454
Can I get
a copy of that?

88
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:17,216
You think
this is a joke, huh?

89
00:10:18,365 --> 00:10:20,099
You see Ken and Barbie
over there?

90
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:23,600
They're gonna walk out of here
without even a slap on the wrist.

91
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,500
Mommy and Daddy
are too hooked up.

92
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,560
But I like
screw-ups like you.

93
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,238
You know why?

94
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,515
'Cause you're 100%
guaranteed conviction.

95
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:37,261
Where's my car?
I crushed it.

96
00:10:37,454 --> 00:10:38,587
You did what?

97
00:10:38,588 --> 00:10:39,721
Sit down! You're done.
Easy, easy.

98
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:40,641
You're done. You
understand me? You're done.

99
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:43,801
And all before your eighteenth
birthday. Now sit down.

100
00:10:45,914 --> 00:10:47,047
Sean.

101
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,981
What the hell were
you thinkin', huh?

102
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:53,911
Mrs. Boswell? Please.

103
00:10:55,185 --> 00:10:57,052
It's, uh, it's Miss.

104
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:04,086
Officer, is it, um,
illegal to smoke in here?

105
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,639
It's a tough state.

106
00:11:14,385 --> 00:11:16,451
And it's
a pretty clear-cut case.

107
00:11:16,506 --> 00:11:19,639
He'll be lucky if they don't
try him as an adult.

108
00:11:21,801 --> 00:11:24,735
This is our third town
in two years.

109
00:11:25,653 --> 00:11:27,720
Your son's got two priors
for reckless driving,

110
00:11:27,907 --> 00:11:29,907
willful destruction
of property.

111
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:31,965
This makes it
strike three.

112
00:11:32,221 --> 00:11:34,821
They're definitely gonna want
to get him off the streets.

113
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:38,095
Well, there's
just got to be another way.

114
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,039
So, where are we
moving this time?

115
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,767
We are not
moving anywhere.

116
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,507
Sean.

117
00:13:50,608 --> 00:13:52,608
I thought you were
gonna be here on the 7th.

118
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:54,266
Today is the 7th.

119
00:13:55,695 --> 00:13:58,228
Well, look,
just hold on one second.

120
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:25,661
Come on in.

121
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,171
This is it.

122
00:14:39,396 --> 00:14:41,996
You know, Sean, I was,
I was gonna be there.

123
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:45,226
But your mom,
she said the 7th, see,

124
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:47,789
and we're a day
ahead of you in Japan.

125
00:14:49,773 --> 00:14:52,907
Well, you're here now,
and that's good.

126
00:14:54,956 --> 00:14:57,156
So, how is your mom?

127
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,431
Where do I sleep?

128
00:15:01,428 --> 00:15:03,628
Now, Sean, you know
she had no other choice.

129
00:15:03,627 --> 00:15:06,361
I mean, it was
either this or juvie hall,

130
00:15:07,651 --> 00:15:09,451
I mean, you just
can't keep moving away

131
00:15:08,988 --> 00:15:10,988
every time
you get into trouble.

132
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:12,933
Worked for you.

133
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:18,704
Look, neither of us
asked for this.

134
00:15:19,388 --> 00:15:22,321
But I promised your mom
I'd take care of you.

135
00:15:23,452 --> 00:15:26,519
So you just go by the
rules her and I agreed to,

136
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,953
and I'm sure
you'll manage just fine.

137
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:29,451
Rules?

138
00:15:29,611 --> 00:15:32,211
Yeah, rules. Real simple.

139
00:15:32,858 --> 00:15:34,258
You go to school,

140
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,101
you come back here
right after.

141
00:15:36,178 --> 00:15:37,778
And I don't
want to see or hear

142
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:39,853
about you
anywhere near a car.

143
00:15:42,562 --> 00:15:45,695
Here,
the bedroom is yours.

144
00:15:50,123 --> 00:15:52,123
Make yourself comfortable.

145
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,757
Lights out in 10.

146
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,866
You got to be kiddin'.

147
00:17:55,091 --> 00:17:56,491
Wrong train.

148
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,516
I'm new here.

149
00:18:03,563 --> 00:18:05,363
Boswell, yes, ma'am.

150
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,463
Japanese food
is like the Army.

151
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:10,710
Don't ask, don't tell.

152
00:19:12,035 --> 00:19:13,435
Name's Twinkie.

153
00:19:13,698 --> 00:19:15,698
Hey, I noticed
you ain't have a laptop.

154
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:18,462
Yeah?

155
00:19:19,362 --> 00:19:21,628
I'll hook you up.
Half price.

156
00:19:22,435 --> 00:19:23,769
No, I'm cool.

157
00:19:24,307 --> 00:19:25,774
60% off. Hmm?

158
00:19:25,737 --> 00:19:27,803
Since we're both army
brats and everything.

159
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:30,043
I ain't got no cash,
man.

160
00:19:30,082 --> 00:19:31,949
And I ain't
an army brat.

161
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:33,513
All right, all right.

162
00:19:33,545 --> 00:19:35,078
Well, what about
a cell phone, huh?

163
00:19:35,906 --> 00:19:38,106
Everybody needs
a cell phone.

164
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,786
No offense,

165
00:19:40,362 --> 00:19:41,629
but I'm probably
not gonna be here

166
00:19:41,371 --> 00:19:43,171
long enough
to remember your name.

167
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:47,373
Then you gonna need some new
shoes to book town with, man.

168
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,924
You like Michael Jordan?

169
00:19:49,346 --> 00:19:50,812
I love Michael Jordan.

170
00:19:51,754 --> 00:19:53,287
Check this out.

171
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:56,144
Brand new Jordans.
Not even out yet.

172
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:59,723
LeBron James couldn't even
get his hands on those.

173
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:03,583
You selling that
Sparco steering wheel?

174
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:06,385
Hell, no.
That's mine right there.

175
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,876
Man, I even paid
retail for it.

176
00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:10,623
What you drive?

177
00:20:11,008 --> 00:20:12,675
My ride?
Yeah.

178
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:14,355
My ride's one of a kind.

179
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:15,126
Show me.

180
00:20:15,994 --> 00:20:18,527
Thought you
weren't stickin' around.

181
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,559
All right.

182
00:20:39,097 --> 00:20:43,831
<i>My life be like
Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh</i>

183
00:20:43,449 --> 00:20:48,116
<i>My life be like
Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh</i>

184
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:50,229
<i>Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh</i>

185
00:20:53,256 --> 00:20:57,456
<i>My life be like
Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh</i>

186
00:20:58,081 --> 00:20:59,481
<i>My life be like</i>

187
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:01,569
<i>It's times like these
that make me say</i>

188
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,373
<i>Lord if you see me
please come my way</i>

189
00:21:04,692 --> 00:21:07,092
<i>Leavin' bread crumbs
for when I stray</i>

190
00:21:06,755 --> 00:21:09,089
<i>Rely on sacrifice
and the price you paid</i>

191
00:21:09,028 --> 00:21:12,562
<i>Feel me like a fingertip</i>

192
00:21:12,787 --> 00:21:16,054
Slamming, huh?
Look at that car.

193
00:21:11,867 --> 00:21:13,600
<i>Tryin' not to quench your
fire with the things I do</i>

194
00:21:17,682 --> 00:21:19,549
At least let me drive.

195
00:21:19,493 --> 00:21:21,893
Y'all better have some
real cars around here.

196
00:21:22,027 --> 00:21:24,094
Okay, I see
somebody got jokes, huh?

197
00:21:24,443 --> 00:21:25,977
Well, all right.

198
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,642
I don't know if you're
ready for them, though.

199
00:21:27,611 --> 00:21:29,678
You look a little nervous.

200
00:21:30,107 --> 00:21:31,641
What up, Tosh?

201
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:52,412
<i>I wonder if you know
How they live in Tokyo</i>

202
00:21:52,607 --> 00:21:57,007
<i>If you see me then you mean
it Then you know you have to go</i>

203
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,891
<i>Tick, Tick, Tick</i>

204
00:21:59,432 --> 00:22:02,432
<i>I wonder if you know
How they live in Tokyo</i>

205
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:06,220
<i>If you see me then you mean
it Then you know you have to go</i>

206
00:22:06,696 --> 00:22:09,029
For when you
blow your wad, man.

207
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,587
<i>Tick, Tick, Tick</i>

208
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,294
Hear that?

209
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,319
It's still not right
for the way I drive.

210
00:23:11,671 --> 00:23:14,604
I don't need a computer to tell
me about my throttle response.

211
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:17,359
Okay.
Then we're done here.

212
00:23:19,568 --> 00:23:22,368
You wouldn't have
that problem with a V8.

213
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:24,278
Boys.

214
00:23:24,648 --> 00:23:27,982
All they care about is
who's got the biggest engine.

215
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:30,742
I'm a guy.
It's in my DNA.

216
00:23:32,086 --> 00:23:33,819
So y'all race
with these things, huh?

217
00:23:34,551 --> 00:23:36,351
Cute little toys.

218
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:40,630
You know, I almost didn't recognize
you without your slippers on.

219
00:23:40,991 --> 00:23:42,924
<i>Don't you mean uwabaki?</i>

220
00:23:43,727 --> 00:23:45,194
Neela, right?

221
00:23:46,151 --> 00:23:48,084
You're a quick learner.

222
00:23:50,735 --> 00:23:52,468
So, where you from,
anyway?

223
00:23:52,892 --> 00:23:54,025
Here.

224
00:23:53,989 --> 00:23:55,655
No, I mean,
not where you live.

225
00:23:55,933 --> 00:23:57,600
Where'd you come from?

226
00:23:57,484 --> 00:23:59,551
Does it really matter
where I'm from?

227
00:24:07,524 --> 00:24:09,190
Who's the tourist?

228
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,074
What's with you
and the schoolgirls, D?

229
00:24:14,276 --> 00:24:15,743
You're moving up
in the world.

230
00:24:15,892 --> 00:24:17,558
You gotta
elevate your company.

231
00:24:17,741 --> 00:24:19,408
Wednesday, Wednesday,
meet Thursday.

232
00:24:19,317 --> 00:24:20,784
God. Girl.

233
00:24:25,445 --> 00:24:27,178
Ladies, hold that thought, all right?

234
00:24:26,973 --> 00:24:28,573
All right, beautiful.
Hold up.

235
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:29,309
Hey!

236
00:24:30,684 --> 00:24:32,084
He was just leaving.

237
00:24:34,405 --> 00:24:36,872
I'm sorry.
I don't speak Japanese.

238
00:24:43,175 --> 00:24:46,108
<i>Understand that?
Gaijin?</i>

239
00:24:45,886 --> 00:24:47,153
Takashi.

240
00:24:47,551 --> 00:24:49,084
We were just talking.

241
00:24:49,103 --> 00:24:50,970
This isn't your scene.

242
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:55,804
<i>That word you called me,
gaijin or something or other,</i>

243
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:58,682
what does that mean
exactly?

244
00:24:59,253 --> 00:25:01,786
Means, turn around,

245
00:25:03,061 --> 00:25:04,261
keep walking.

246
00:25:04,766 --> 00:25:06,099
That's exactly
what we gonna do.

247
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,257
Come on, man,
let's roll.

248
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,017
<i>Yo, look, man,
he's yakuza.</i>

249
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,804
Now, see, that's funny,

250
00:25:11,478 --> 00:25:14,545
'cause I thought this
was, like, a free country

251
00:25:15,406 --> 00:25:18,339
where a girl could talk
to whoever she wants.

252
00:25:21,446 --> 00:25:23,379
You know who I am,
boy?

253
00:25:24,341 --> 00:25:28,541
Yeah. You're like the Justin
Timberlake of Japan, right?

254
00:25:33,821 --> 00:25:35,021
Leave.

255
00:25:35,287 --> 00:25:38,354
<i>Damn, man.
You know yakuza? The Mafia?</i>

256
00:25:40,245 --> 00:25:41,778
<i>Look, sorry, DK- san.</i>

257
00:25:41,981 --> 00:25:43,981
Monkey didn't have
his banana today.

258
00:25:44,093 --> 00:25:45,826
Hey, D, let's go.

259
00:25:46,007 --> 00:25:47,340
It's time to race.

260
00:25:51,737 --> 00:25:53,603
Hey, good luck, Timberlake.

261
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:05,559
You're the one that's lucky,
'cause I'm about to race.

262
00:26:08,697 --> 00:26:10,297
Then let's race.

263
00:26:13,121 --> 00:26:16,121
With what, huh?
Your skateboard?

264
00:26:18,225 --> 00:26:21,025
Easy to sound cocky
when you got no ride.

265
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:23,342
Take mine.

266
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:28,486
Let's race.

267
00:26:32,696 --> 00:26:35,296
What? I wanna see
what the kid's got.

268
00:26:42,057 --> 00:26:43,590
Can he drive?

269
00:26:44,593 --> 00:26:46,060
Can he drive?

270
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,299
You know what DK
stands for?

271
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,840
Donkey Kong?

272
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,343
Drift King.

273
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,023
Drift?

274
00:26:58,137 --> 00:27:00,070
What do you mean,
drift?

275
00:27:12,817 --> 00:27:14,283
Still need
a dictionary?

276
00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:17,275
You know that
real famous painting?

277
00:27:17,593 --> 00:27:19,993
The one of the woman
who's smiling all the time?

278
00:27:19,489 --> 00:27:20,489
<i>The Mona Lisa.</i>

279
00:27:20,585 --> 00:27:21,719
Right, right, right.
Mona Lisa.

280
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,273
Well, look, man,
this car right here's

281
00:27:23,112 --> 00:27:24,712
<i>like the Mona Lisa
of the drift world.</i>

282
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:27,742
Han rebuilt this bad boy
from ground up.

283
00:27:27,888 --> 00:27:29,355
We talking forged pistons,

284
00:27:29,984 --> 00:27:33,251
bigger turbo,
new rods, new crankshaft.

285
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:36,719
Hey, man, Han's labor
ain't cheap, man, you feel me?

286
00:27:37,713 --> 00:27:40,979
Well, if I needed a 30-second
lesson on how to drift...

287
00:27:41,617 --> 00:27:44,150
All right, look, man, there's lots
of ways you can do this, all right?

288
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,811
Hand braking
is the easiest,

289
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:45,900
so the first thing
I want you to do,

290
00:27:46,058 --> 00:27:47,324
I want you
to rip that e-brake.

291
00:27:47,321 --> 00:27:48,454
All right,
after you rip the e-brake,

292
00:27:48,368 --> 00:27:50,168
then I want you
to power over.

293
00:27:51,745 --> 00:27:52,945
You know what?

294
00:27:53,553 --> 00:27:55,086
Just don't mess up Mona,
all right?

295
00:27:56,184 --> 00:27:57,517
All right.

296
00:28:50,626 --> 00:28:51,826
Ready.

297
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:54,091
Set.

298
00:28:56,904 --> 00:28:57,904
Go!

299
00:29:39,082 --> 00:29:40,482
I told you.

300
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,253
Damn it!

301
00:31:09,241 --> 00:31:10,441
Damn it!

302
00:32:52,025 --> 00:32:53,692
Don't leave town.

303
00:33:09,064 --> 00:33:11,198
Do you know
what time it is?

304
00:33:11,392 --> 00:33:13,592
I thought
it was around 7:00.

305
00:33:14,104 --> 00:33:16,770
You know,
US is a few hours behind.

306
00:33:19,643 --> 00:33:22,576
Looks like the party
was better here, anyway.

307
00:33:24,724 --> 00:33:26,790
Have you been racing, Sean?

308
00:33:31,557 --> 00:33:33,290
You're out of here.

309
00:33:36,812 --> 00:33:38,078
Go ahead.

310
00:33:39,939 --> 00:33:41,673
You don't get it,
do you?

311
00:33:41,547 --> 00:33:43,681
You have
nowhere else to go.

312
00:33:44,035 --> 00:33:45,368
If it doesn't
work out here,

313
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:48,269
you're going to jail.
Do you get that?

314
00:33:51,189 --> 00:33:52,656
This isn't a game.

315
00:33:53,356 --> 00:33:55,556
And I'm gonna tell you
one more time,

316
00:33:55,316 --> 00:33:56,983
if you're gonna
live under my roof,

317
00:33:57,061 --> 00:33:59,928
you're gonna go by
my rules or get out.

318
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,121
Understand?

319
00:34:03,244 --> 00:34:04,777
Understand?

320
00:34:05,732 --> 00:34:06,998
Yes, sir.

321
00:34:57,613 --> 00:34:58,880
Get in.

322
00:34:59,612 --> 00:35:01,612
I'll get you your money.

323
00:35:01,979 --> 00:35:04,646
Why you talking
like you have a choice?

324
00:35:18,181 --> 00:35:19,781
There's a guy in there
with a paw

325
00:35:19,654 --> 00:35:21,454
that owes me some money.

326
00:35:21,647 --> 00:35:22,847
A paw?

327
00:35:24,629 --> 00:35:26,363
Go get me my money.

328
00:35:28,903 --> 00:35:30,303
Okay.

329
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,763
Han said,

330
00:36:28,805 --> 00:36:30,271
<i>okane.</i>

331
00:36:37,998 --> 00:36:40,464
<i>Han said, okane.</i>

332
00:37:09,398 --> 00:37:10,731
Let's go.

333
00:37:19,086 --> 00:37:22,153
You're in the pickup
and delivery business now.

334
00:37:21,982 --> 00:37:24,516
I might call you once a week
or once an hour.

335
00:37:24,935 --> 00:37:26,468
I don't care
if you're sick as a dog

336
00:37:26,165 --> 00:37:27,898
or in bed with Beyoncé.

337
00:37:27,823 --> 00:37:29,423
I call, you show.

338
00:37:30,535 --> 00:37:32,335
Only if you teach me
how to drift.

339
00:37:32,421 --> 00:37:34,287
This ain't a negotiation.

340
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,590
I wasn't negotiating.

341
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:26,813
What's he doing here?

342
00:38:27,132 --> 00:38:29,132
He's paying me back for
that crumpled beer can

343
00:38:29,085 --> 00:38:30,952
sitting in my garage.

344
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,800
Hope
he's not driving.

345
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:37,181
<i>Gaijin.</i>

346
00:38:38,278 --> 00:38:39,945
When is your next race?

347
00:38:40,206 --> 00:38:41,873
I'd really like to be there.

348
00:38:43,494 --> 00:38:44,894
Why not be in it?

349
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:51,761
You heard me.

350
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:54,640
Ready to lose
another car, Han?

351
00:38:55,246 --> 00:38:58,446
I'm ready to take that
'86 Corolla off your hands.

352
00:39:00,051 --> 00:39:01,384
All right.

353
00:39:01,787 --> 00:39:03,720
Put up the '72 Skyline.

354
00:39:04,764 --> 00:39:05,831
Done.

355
00:39:07,964 --> 00:39:10,097
What do you think,
Morimoto, huh?

356
00:39:13,467 --> 00:39:15,267
Get him out of here.

357
00:39:16,907 --> 00:39:19,040
We have business
to discuss.

358
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,047
Your shipment's late.

359
00:39:30,492 --> 00:39:33,625
Since when are you
so worried about the details?

360
00:39:35,435 --> 00:39:37,901
When is
the shipment arriving, Han?

361
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,900
Just sit pretty
and let me handle it.

362
00:40:03,637 --> 00:40:05,303
Hey, Dad, it's me.

363
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,900
Uh, I had to
stay after school

364
00:40:07,836 --> 00:40:09,702
for some
extracurricular activities.

365
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,713
So I'll be home
a little later.

366
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:15,278
Sir.

367
00:40:17,923 --> 00:40:20,856
You really need to stop
following me around.

368
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,977
What are you
doing here?

369
00:40:23,243 --> 00:40:25,177
I thought I'd stop by
and ask your boyfriend

370
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,498
for some drifting lessons.

371
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,833
Trust me.

372
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,940
You don't wanna be
a part of this world.

373
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,233
It's good enough for you.

374
00:40:33,292 --> 00:40:35,292
You don't know
anything about me.

375
00:40:35,236 --> 00:40:37,570
Well, why don't you
think I know?

376
00:40:37,844 --> 00:40:40,244
<i>'Cause I'm a gaijin?
An outsider?</i>

377
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,127
Let me guess.

378
00:40:43,755 --> 00:40:46,422
You're an army brat
who moved around a lot.

379
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,407
Your mama and daddy
was never home.

380
00:40:49,132 --> 00:40:52,132
So you walked around
pissed off all the time.

381
00:40:52,004 --> 00:40:55,338
And now you found your family
with these drift nuts.

382
00:40:59,027 --> 00:41:00,827
Zero for one, cowboy.

383
00:41:12,827 --> 00:41:14,893
Why can't you go find
a nice Japanese girl

384
00:41:14,956 --> 00:41:16,623
like the rest of
the white guys around here?

385
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:19,374
<i>Mamacita, oh my God,
I think your on fire</i>

386
00:41:20,523 --> 00:41:22,523
<i>Do you want me
to get you water</i>

387
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:25,037
Is everything okay
back there?

388
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,980
I can handle DK.

389
00:41:27,972 --> 00:41:29,838
<i>I thought he's yakuza.</i>

390
00:41:30,692 --> 00:41:32,425
<i>His uncle's yakuza.</i>

391
00:41:33,316 --> 00:41:36,783
He's just playing gangster
in his little storage room.

392
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,072
But I need him.

393
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:45,259
He keeps Uncle Kamata
from poking around too much.

394
00:41:45,644 --> 00:41:47,310
What do you mean?

395
00:41:48,388 --> 00:41:50,322
Well, his uncle gets
a piece of the action

396
00:41:50,438 --> 00:41:52,038
from everyone
on his turf.

397
00:41:52,574 --> 00:41:54,240
We're on his turf.

398
00:41:54,743 --> 00:41:56,410
50% of something
is better than

399
00:41:56,158 --> 00:41:57,824
100% of nothing.

400
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:02,376
So have you raced DK?

401
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,423
Why not? Is he that good?

402
00:42:06,178 --> 00:42:08,311
What's the point
of a race?

403
00:42:09,075 --> 00:42:11,542
To see if I'm better
than the other guy.

404
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,797
Just proves you're faster,
that's all.

405
00:42:13,774 --> 00:42:15,240
If I were to race,
it would have to be

406
00:42:15,255 --> 00:42:17,122
for something important.

407
00:42:17,423 --> 00:42:19,423
Or why else do it at all?

408
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:23,430
Why are you
letting me race?

409
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,991
'Cause you're
DK's kryptonite.

410
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:29,030
And you owe me a car.

411
00:42:31,067 --> 00:42:34,133
<i>She wanna break it down, break it
down, break it down, break it down</i>

412
00:42:36,133 --> 00:42:39,533
<i>She want some reggaeton,
reggaeton, reggaeton, reggaeton</i>

413
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:44,667
<i>She wanna break it down, break it
down, break it down, break it down</i>

414
00:42:46,467 --> 00:42:49,067
<i>She want some reggaeton,
reggaeton, reggaeton, reggaeton</i>

415
00:42:51,662 --> 00:42:52,729
Oh, shit.

416
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:57,906
<i>I make ya smile right</i>

417
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:01,647
What the...

418
00:43:02,006 --> 00:43:04,606
Police cars here are
only factory-tuned.

419
00:43:04,432 --> 00:43:05,965
You can do
better than 180 k,

420
00:43:05,801 --> 00:43:08,067
they can't catch you,
so they don't even try.

421
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,267
<i>'Cause its just nice you lookin
different sayin' to yourself</i>

422
00:43:11,113 --> 00:43:12,647
You know what?

423
00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:14,236
I'm beginning to like
this country already.

424
00:43:11,867 --> 00:43:14,200
<i>When my chain keep linkin'
like Christmas lights</i>

425
00:43:16,467 --> 00:43:20,600
<i>Mamacita, oh my God
I think your on fire</i>

426
00:43:20,733 --> 00:43:23,467
<i>Do you want me
to get you water</i>

427
00:43:30,121 --> 00:43:31,254
Danny!

428
00:43:32,353 --> 00:43:34,153
You're looking good.

429
00:43:37,937 --> 00:43:39,137
Disco.

430
00:43:39,218 --> 00:43:40,484
We gotta catch up.

431
00:43:46,626 --> 00:43:48,159
Get you a drink on me, huh?

432
00:43:48,154 --> 00:43:49,421
Let's go.

433
00:44:03,017 --> 00:44:05,950
Aha. Easy now, ladies.

434
00:44:08,602 --> 00:44:09,868
Come on.

435
00:44:10,113 --> 00:44:13,713
<i>Hey Mami, you sexy,
hey Mami, you sexy</i>

436
00:44:11,267 --> 00:44:13,667
What's up?
How you doing?

437
00:44:13,733 --> 00:44:15,067
Hey, baby.

438
00:44:15,133 --> 00:44:17,933
<i>Hey Mami, you sexy,
hey Mami, you sexy</i>

439
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
<i>Hey Mami, you sexy</i>

440
00:44:20,067 --> 00:44:21,400
<i>Can I get that number</i>

441
00:44:21,467 --> 00:44:23,133
<i>Big hot pockets,
feya, ugly</i>

442
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,267
<i>Corny, busted,
chopped, straight fugly</i>

443
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:27,000
<i>British guys playing rugby</i>

444
00:44:27,067 --> 00:44:28,600
<i>Brooklyn boys
who wanna thug me</i>

445
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:30,400
<i>Skanky, cranky,
foogly, oogly</i>

446
00:44:30,533 --> 00:44:32,133
<i>Slammin dudes
that wanna do me</i>

447
00:44:32,267 --> 00:44:33,467
<i>G'Doonk G'Doonk,
skoonky, flavors</i>

448
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,267
Keep your hands
off the kid, girls.

449
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:36,800
He's underage.

450
00:44:36,933 --> 00:44:38,867
<i>Country boys and them boys
in the city</i>

451
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,800
Ladies, ladies, ladies.

452
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,867
Disneyland
for grownups, huh?

453
00:44:42,933 --> 00:44:44,400
All these girls, man,
they look like...

454
00:44:44,467 --> 00:44:45,867
What, models?

455
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,000
Check it out.

456
00:44:47,067 --> 00:44:48,800
See,
Tokyo is the fashion capital

457
00:44:48,867 --> 00:44:50,267
on this side of the planet,
all right?

458
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:51,733
Now, imagine
you been posing all day.

459
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,200
I mean,
that's a lot of hard work.

460
00:44:53,267 --> 00:44:54,867
Not only do you get tired,
but, on top of that,

461
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:56,467
you wanna have a little fun,
but you can't

462
00:44:56,533 --> 00:44:58,533
'cause you don't even know
nobody in town.

463
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,000
And most of
the guys around here are

464
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:01,800
too chicken shit
to even try picking up one.

465
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:03,533
So what do you do?

466
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:07,667
Man, you talk to the little
dude who makes you laugh.

467
00:45:07,733 --> 00:45:08,800
Yeah.

468
00:45:09,733 --> 00:45:11,867
Look, man, I don't just think
outside the box.

469
00:45:11,933 --> 00:45:13,467
I tear it up.

470
00:45:13,533 --> 00:45:15,133
That's my thing.

471
00:45:15,267 --> 00:45:16,267
Yo.

472
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,933
<i>You should
slow it down papi</i>

473
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,800
<i>You sound like
a carbon copy</i>

474
00:45:23,333 --> 00:45:24,467
Sean!

475
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,667
<i>But you're
just plain sloppy</i>

476
00:45:26,733 --> 00:45:30,200
<i>Hey Mami, you sexy</i>

477
00:45:32,733 --> 00:45:34,400
<i>It's dipset Bitch</i>

478
00:45:34,467 --> 00:45:39,467
<i>There it go
Baby don't stop now</i>

479
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:45,733
<i>There you go
Damn shorty look good</i>

480
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,333
<i>And I'm thinkin' about
gettin' at her</i>

481
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,000
<i>Okay,
time to whistle at her</i>

482
00:45:49,067 --> 00:45:54,000
<i>Ay girl,
you make my whistle blow</i>

483
00:45:54,067 --> 00:45:55,800
<i>There it go
Bring it here baby</i>

484
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,000
<i>There it go
Bring it here baby</i>

485
00:45:58,667 --> 00:46:00,333
<i>Top down
and I'm at it again</i>

486
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:02,133
<i>It's hot now
and I'm at it to win</i>

487
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,533
<i>You heard me</i>

488
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,600
<i>Who want it with me</i>

489
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:06,733
<i>Nobody wanna it with me
Oh, I'm so fly</i>

490
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,933
<i>Oh, Mami, Back up</i>

491
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,400
<i>Move it till you feel
something hard on your back</i>

492
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:11,200
The red Evo's yours.

493
00:46:11,267 --> 00:46:13,600
<i>If u want it come and get it
I ain't kiddin' I'm with it</i>

494
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:15,333
<i>Here it go, go</i>

495
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:20,267
<i>So, girl,
let me see you get low</i>

496
00:46:20,333 --> 00:46:22,333
<i>There it go
Yeah, just like that</i>

497
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,867
What do you mean?

498
00:46:25,667 --> 00:46:27,267
You're representing
me now.

499
00:46:27,333 --> 00:46:29,867
What you think, I'm gonna
let you roll in a Hyundai?

500
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:34,733
<i>So, girl,
let me see you get low</i>

501
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,400
Oh, man.

502
00:47:02,933 --> 00:47:03,933
Damn it.

503
00:47:09,533 --> 00:47:11,600
My mother,
she's blind in one eye

504
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:13,533
and she can drift
better than that.

505
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,267
Han,
where did you find this guy?

506
00:47:19,467 --> 00:47:22,200
Will someone please teach
this guy how to drift?

507
00:47:45,867 --> 00:47:47,400
Is that yours?

508
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,667
Sure is.

509
00:47:57,267 --> 00:47:58,533
What happened?

510
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,200
I don't know. I found
it this way at the base.

511
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,667
It's got potential.

512
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,933
Yeah, maybe. We'll see.

513
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:23,533
You know, Sean,
the Japanese have a saying.

514
00:48:26,667 --> 00:48:29,133
"The nail that sticks out
gets hammered. "

515
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,000
You're gonna be late.

516
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,733
Sean!

517
00:49:09,867 --> 00:49:11,667
Come on, man, you broke it.

518
00:49:16,867 --> 00:49:17,933
Hey, whoa, whoa.

519
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,133
There must be
a misunderstanding.

520
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:25,000
Out of my way,
or you're next.

521
00:49:25,067 --> 00:49:26,133
Take it easy.

522
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,000
Look, man, I don't
do refunds, all right?

523
00:49:28,067 --> 00:49:30,333
Okay, let's go, then!
Let's go!

524
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:32,133
Touch me again...

525
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,867
Here.

526
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Try not to break
this one.

527
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,400
Say, man!

528
00:49:55,467 --> 00:49:57,067
What the hell is
wrong with you, huh?

529
00:49:57,133 --> 00:49:59,933
Now everybody's gonna want
exchanges around here.

530
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,133
Damn!

531
00:50:13,733 --> 00:50:16,067
Not easy saving the day,
is it?

532
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,733
Maybe you could give me
some pointers sometime.

533
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,467
You're doing
all right.

534
00:50:22,533 --> 00:50:23,733
Thanks.

535
00:50:27,267 --> 00:50:28,333
Hey.

536
00:50:29,533 --> 00:50:30,600
Yeah?

537
00:50:31,667 --> 00:50:33,800
Sorry about the other night.

538
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,733
Your life isn't
any of my business.

539
00:50:38,333 --> 00:50:39,733
It's okay.

540
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,133
Foul!

541
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,800
Ain't no damn foul.
That was a foul.

542
00:51:05,867 --> 00:51:07,267
Yo, you in my face.
That was a foul.

543
00:51:07,333 --> 00:51:09,867
Hey, Han,
sort this wanker out.

544
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:11,200
A wanker?

545
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:13,467
What do I look like,
a zebra?

546
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,800
So, how did you end up
over here, anyway?

547
00:51:23,933 --> 00:51:26,333
Well, you know
those old Westerns

548
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,933
where the cowboys
make a run for the border?

549
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,267
This is my Mexico.

550
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,533
Why'd you let me
race with your car?

551
00:51:40,667 --> 00:51:42,867
You knew
I was gonna wreck it.

552
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:44,733
Why not?

553
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,067
'Cause it's a lot of money.

554
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,667
I have money.

555
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,867
It's trust and character
I need around me.

556
00:51:55,533 --> 00:51:57,600
You know, who you
choose to be around you

557
00:51:57,667 --> 00:51:59,667
lets you know
who you are.

558
00:52:01,733 --> 00:52:03,400
And one car in exchange
for knowing

559
00:52:03,467 --> 00:52:05,200
what a man's made of,

560
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,933
that's a price
I can live with.

561
00:52:12,133 --> 00:52:14,667
Look at all those
people down there.

562
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:17,667
They follow the rules,
for what?

563
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,267
They're letting
fear lead them.

564
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,267
What happens if they don't?

565
00:52:26,067 --> 00:52:28,133
Life's simple.

566
00:52:28,467 --> 00:52:30,733
You make choices
and you don't look back.

567
00:52:45,333 --> 00:52:47,000
<i>So,
if you don't drift to win,</i>

568
00:52:47,067 --> 00:52:49,000
<i>what do you drift for?</i>

569
00:52:49,467 --> 00:52:50,733
<i>You really
want to know?</i>

570
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:52,133
<i>Yeah.</i>

571
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,467
<i>Okay. Let's go.</i>

572
00:54:11,933 --> 00:54:14,467
<i>There's no "wax on,
wax off" with drifting.</i>

573
00:54:14,867 --> 00:54:16,267
Learn by doin' it.

574
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,733
The first drifters
invented drifting

575
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,600
out here in the mountains
by feeling it.

576
00:54:21,733 --> 00:54:23,067
So feel it.

577
00:54:35,667 --> 00:54:36,800
Again!

578
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,400
What's in this bag?

579
00:54:40,933 --> 00:54:42,000
You'll see.

580
00:54:42,533 --> 00:54:43,933
How much you got?

581
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,467
Keep going, keep going.

582
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,200
I'm so good, man, I could
sell rubbers to a monk.

583
00:54:59,133 --> 00:55:00,133
Again.

584
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:23,467
Again.

585
00:55:32,933 --> 00:55:35,733
Watch it. Watch it.
Not too early, now.

586
00:55:41,067 --> 00:55:43,467
Go, go, go, go!

587
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,733
Don't lose it! Don't lose it!

588
00:56:34,733 --> 00:56:36,000
Hey, Han.

589
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,800
Hey, Twink.
Get this man a bunk.

590
00:58:06,667 --> 00:58:08,333
Pleasure doing business.

591
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,200
Yeah, baby. I told you.
I told you, didn't I?

592
00:58:54,867 --> 00:58:56,733
It's actually not bad.

593
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:58,800
I didn't even have
to put ketchup on it.

594
00:58:59,867 --> 00:59:02,000
<i>See,
I'm not a total gaijin.</i>

595
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,267
I hate that word.

596
00:59:05,733 --> 00:59:07,800
It's what they used
to call me when I was a kid.

597
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:11,533
I thought
you were born here.

598
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,667
Well, "outsider" can mean
many different things.

599
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
My mom died when I was 10.

600
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,000
She came out here
from Australia

601
00:59:25,067 --> 00:59:26,733
when she
finished high school.

602
00:59:26,933 --> 00:59:28,267
And all I know
about her is that

603
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:31,067
she went to work
in a hostess bar.

604
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,333
DK's grandmother took me in.

605
00:59:39,467 --> 00:59:42,400
Well, my parents
split up when I was three.

606
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,333
Me and Mom
moved around a lot.

607
00:59:46,133 --> 00:59:47,933
Mostly 'cause of me.

608
00:59:48,933 --> 00:59:51,267
Well,
it was all 'cause of me.

609
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,667
Kind of made myself
an outsider, you know,

610
00:59:55,867 --> 00:59:58,200
without even
thinking about it.

611
01:00:00,267 --> 01:00:01,467
But I realize now,

612
01:00:01,533 --> 01:00:03,933
outsider or insider,
it doesn't really matter.

613
01:00:05,133 --> 01:00:08,200
All that matters is knowing
what you really want

614
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,933
and going after it.

615
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,800
We used to come up here
when we were kids.

616
01:00:34,267 --> 01:00:37,600
Even before we could drive
we'd cut class, sneak out,

617
01:00:37,733 --> 01:00:40,267
come up here, and watch
the older kids drift.

618
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Things were different
back then.

619
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:55,867
Once I got my license,
I practically lived up here.

620
01:00:56,467 --> 01:00:59,067
Back then, kids just drove
whatever they had.

621
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,467
You know, we just made do.

622
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,867
No one bothered us.

623
01:01:03,333 --> 01:01:04,867
The day I got my license

624
01:01:04,933 --> 01:01:07,400
is the day I got
my first speeding ticket.

625
01:01:07,467 --> 01:01:09,867
The day after that,
I won my first race.

626
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,933
I beat this rich kid
by three lengths.

627
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,667
I gotta admit, it felt good.

628
01:01:18,533 --> 01:01:19,800
It felt like...

629
01:01:20,067 --> 01:01:22,333
Like everything else
just disappears.

630
01:01:24,333 --> 01:01:25,800
No past and no future.

631
01:01:26,333 --> 01:01:27,867
No problems.

632
01:01:29,867 --> 01:01:31,467
Just the moment.

633
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,600
Boy needs to chill.

634
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:01,333
Hey, Twink,
I'm gonna grab another set.

635
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,667
Whoa! Whoa,
whoa, whoa! Another set?

636
01:02:03,933 --> 01:02:06,533
No. Look, that was
your third set today.

637
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,600
I mean,
them tires ain't cheap.

638
01:02:18,467 --> 01:02:20,133
DK, grab a chair.

639
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:22,000
We're about to
roast some marshmallows.

640
01:02:23,067 --> 01:02:24,800
Yo, come on, man, look...

641
01:02:37,133 --> 01:02:38,867
Stay away from her,

642
01:02:39,067 --> 01:02:42,400
or the only thing you'll
be driving is a wheelchair.

643
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,200
Find yourself a new driver.

644
01:03:03,067 --> 01:03:04,200
I'm all right.

645
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,800
What'd you expect?

646
01:03:06,267 --> 01:03:07,667
You didn't just
play with fire,

647
01:03:07,733 --> 01:03:09,467
you soaked
the matches in gasoline.

648
01:03:33,333 --> 01:03:34,667
It's over.

649
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,000
<i>All this over a gaijin?</i>

650
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:58,733
<i>I am a gaijin.</i>

651
01:04:01,667 --> 01:04:03,400
You've changed, DK.

652
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,600
You say I've changed.

653
01:04:12,933 --> 01:04:15,533
But we're not so different,
you and I.

654
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,667
We're both products
of fuckups, aren't we?

655
01:04:25,667 --> 01:04:28,933
They say your mom
was the best trick

656
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,533
in all of Kabukicho
back in the day.

657
01:04:32,067 --> 01:04:33,667
Leave my mother
out of this.

658
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:37,200
If we hadn't taken you in,
you'd be just like her,

659
01:04:38,067 --> 01:04:40,067
doing anything
for a buck.

660
01:04:41,267 --> 01:04:43,000
Think anyone would take
a second look at you

661
01:04:43,067 --> 01:04:44,533
if it wasn't
for your uncle?

662
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,667
We're the same, Neela.

663
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,733
Difference is I know who I am
and where I belong.

664
01:05:13,667 --> 01:05:15,667
Do you know
who you are?

665
01:05:18,467 --> 01:05:22,000
Do you know
where you belong?

666
01:05:41,267 --> 01:05:42,267
Hey.

667
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:48,600
Come on.

668
01:09:33,533 --> 01:09:34,800
Hey, brother.

669
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,133
I vouched for you!

670
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,133
Put my reputation
on the line for you!

671
01:09:39,267 --> 01:09:40,600
We were partners!

672
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,867
You think you can keep
your side deals from me?

673
01:09:43,933 --> 01:09:46,867
Come on.
We ain't in the Boy Scouts.

674
01:09:47,667 --> 01:09:48,800
This is what we do.

675
01:09:48,933 --> 01:09:50,133
Takashi!

676
01:09:57,267 --> 01:09:59,400
What about now? Hmm?

677
01:10:00,933 --> 01:10:02,667
Is this what we do?

678
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,867
Man, you need me.

679
01:10:06,133 --> 01:10:07,933
You'd still be
shaking down teahouses

680
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,467
for chump change
if it wasn't for me.

681
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:20,533
Get in!

682
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,933
Go! Go! Go!

683
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,267
Come on.

684
01:13:48,933 --> 01:13:50,267
Sean. Sean!

685
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Takashi.

686
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,533
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

687
01:16:58,933 --> 01:17:00,067
Okay.

688
01:17:01,267 --> 01:17:02,667
I'll go with you.

689
01:17:03,133 --> 01:17:04,333
Neela.

690
01:17:15,333 --> 01:17:17,667
See you when
Daddy's not around.

691
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:42,400
I'm putting you
on a plane tonight.

692
01:17:42,467 --> 01:17:43,533
Dad...

693
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,067
Sean, don't argue with me.

694
01:17:45,133 --> 01:17:47,933
I did this.
I can't run away.

695
01:17:49,067 --> 01:17:50,133
I can't.

696
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,800
Sean,
I'm your father.

697
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:53,867
I'm responsible
for your well-being.

698
01:17:54,467 --> 01:17:56,467
And I'm responsible
for my mess.

699
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,400
I gotta do this.

700
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,600
Can you understand that?

701
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,333
At least you're not
redoing my mistakes.

702
01:18:53,067 --> 01:18:54,800
You all right, man?

703
01:18:58,733 --> 01:19:00,333
We're leaving town.

704
01:19:01,067 --> 01:19:02,600
Look, I know some people...

705
01:19:04,133 --> 01:19:05,933
I can't do it, Twink.

706
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:10,000
Look, DK wants your head.

707
01:19:10,867 --> 01:19:12,200
All right?

708
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,667
And the trouble you
just made for Kamata?

709
01:19:15,867 --> 01:19:17,933
You're done here, bro.

710
01:19:19,467 --> 01:19:21,067
Maybe I should
talk to Kamata.

711
01:19:22,333 --> 01:19:23,933
What?

712
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,067
DK answers to him.

713
01:19:28,867 --> 01:19:31,133
I know I just
didn't hear that.

714
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:36,600
I gotta end this.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

715
01:19:36,667 --> 01:19:38,600
What, are you crazy, huh?

716
01:19:38,867 --> 01:19:40,400
Han is dead, all right!

717
01:19:40,533 --> 01:19:43,533
Plus, you can't just walk
into Kamata's place, man!

718
01:19:46,667 --> 01:19:48,200
It's all I got.

719
01:19:54,733 --> 01:19:57,933
Something I think Han
would've wanted you to have.

720
01:20:12,533 --> 01:20:13,933
What's this?

721
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:16,800
You're gonna need it
if you're gonna make it

722
01:20:16,933 --> 01:20:19,067
out of Kamata's place
alive.

723
01:20:23,067 --> 01:20:24,733
Don't you need it?

724
01:20:26,467 --> 01:20:29,933
No, it's cool.
Look, I'll figure it out.

725
01:21:39,867 --> 01:21:40,933
Sean.

726
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:47,333
You need to leave.

727
01:21:47,667 --> 01:21:49,800
You came to the wrong place.

728
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,200
I didn't come here
to see you.

729
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:53,867
Takashi.

730
01:22:22,467 --> 01:22:23,733
You think

731
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:29,333
you can walk in here,
dump some cash and walk out?

732
01:22:31,467 --> 01:22:33,400
I know I'm only returning
what belonged to you

733
01:22:33,467 --> 01:22:35,400
in the first place, sir.

734
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,200
But that's not
why I really came.

735
01:22:39,933 --> 01:22:41,933
I came here
to apologize.

736
01:22:44,133 --> 01:22:47,800
I know your nephew and I have
embarrassed ourselves badly.

737
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:03,533
Sir, I'm here to offer you
a peaceful solution.

738
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:08,667
How do you plan
to accomplish that?

739
01:23:10,067 --> 01:23:11,267
A race.

740
01:23:16,467 --> 01:23:19,400
DK and I have caused
nothing but problems for you,

741
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,067
for us.

742
01:23:22,333 --> 01:23:24,667
And I'm asking you
to allow us to settle this,

743
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:26,733
once and for all.

744
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,333
We race

745
01:23:31,133 --> 01:23:33,200
and the loser leaves town
for good.

746
01:23:33,333 --> 01:23:36,133
I've already beat
this piece of shit once!

747
01:23:36,333 --> 01:23:37,400
Good.

748
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,800
Then it should be easy.

749
01:24:19,067 --> 01:24:21,133
The cops
took all the cars.

750
01:24:21,667 --> 01:24:22,733
Hey!

751
01:25:39,533 --> 01:25:41,200
That's why she's spitting.

752
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,067
We almost there, Twink.

753
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,933
Couple more tweaks.

754
01:26:09,467 --> 01:26:11,800
It's not the car
I'm worried about, man.

755
01:26:13,267 --> 01:26:15,200
DK picked this road
for a reason.

756
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,267
This is his mountain.

757
01:26:19,267 --> 01:26:22,333
He's the only one to ever
make it to the bottom.

758
01:30:16,333 --> 01:30:17,467
Yeah!

759
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:25,467
Yeah!

760
01:30:25,533 --> 01:30:26,667
Yes!

761
01:31:24,867 --> 01:31:25,933
Come on.

762
01:31:37,133 --> 01:31:38,400
Yeah! Come on!

763
01:31:38,467 --> 01:31:39,667
Come on, Sean.

764
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:41,067
Let's go! Let's go!

765
01:31:41,133 --> 01:31:43,067
Sean, you the boss. Let's go.

766
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:13,467
Damn! Come on, man!
That ain't right.

767
01:34:23,533 --> 01:34:24,533
Yeah, baby!

768
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:25,800
That's what
I'm talking about, man.

769
01:34:25,867 --> 01:34:27,200
I told you!

770
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:14,733
<i>I wonder if you know
How they live in Tokyo</i>

771
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:18,467
<i>If you see me then you mean
it Then you know you have to go</i>

772
01:35:18,533 --> 01:35:20,733
<i>Fast and furious</i>

773
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,333
<i>Tick, Tick, Tick</i>

774
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:24,733
<i>Fast and furious</i>

775
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:26,733
<i>Tick, Tick, Tick</i>

776
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:33,933
Hey, yo, Sean!
Yo, Sean!

777
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:36,333
Hey, check this out, man.

778
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:39,467
This dude over here
wanna race the new DK.

779
01:35:40,467 --> 01:35:43,267
Heard he's been beating
everybody around Asia, too.

780
01:35:43,333 --> 01:35:45,200
Not tonight, Twinkie.

781
01:35:48,667 --> 01:35:50,267
Said he knew Han.

782
01:35:56,867 --> 01:35:58,667
Said Han was family.

783
01:36:12,667 --> 01:36:14,000
All right.

784
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,467
Let's race.

785
01:36:42,733 --> 01:36:44,067
Nice ride.

786
01:36:44,533 --> 01:36:47,533
I won it from my friend Han,
a few years ago.

787
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:52,267
I didn't know he was
into American muscle.

788
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,867
He was when
he was rolling with me.

789
01:36:57,467 --> 01:36:59,933
You know this ain't
no 10-second race.

790
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:02,333
I got nothing but time.

791
01:37:05,933 --> 01:37:07,467
You ready, kid?

792
01:37:18,333 --> 01:37:20,000
Come on, Sean! Come on!

793
01:37:22,067 --> 01:37:23,200
Ready!

794
01:37:26,333 --> 01:37:27,333
Set!

795
01:37:31,667 --> 01:37:32,867
Go!

796
01:40:28,267 --> 01:40:36,867
