1
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,585
<i>Michael.</i>

2
00:00:28,752 --> 00:00:31,710
<i>Dear Michael. Of course it's you.
Who else could they send?</i>

3
00:00:31,877 --> 00:00:33,169
<i>Who else could be trusted?</i>

4
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:36,085
<i>And I know it's a long way and you're ready to go to work.</i>

5
00:00:36,252 --> 00:00:39,544
<i>All I'm saying is wait, just wait, just --
Just please hear me out.</i>

6
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,919
<i>Because this is not an episode, relapse, fuckup.</i>

7
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,669
<i>I'm begging you, Michael, I'm begging you.</i>

8
00:00:45,835 --> 00:00:48,669
<i>Try and make believe this is not just madness...</i>

9
00:00:48,835 --> 00:00:51,835
<i>...because this is not just madness.</i>

10
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,460
<i>Two weeks ago, I came out of the building, okay?</i>

11
00:00:54,627 --> 00:00:57,169
<i>I'm running across 6th Avenue, there's a car waiting...</i>

12
00:00:57,335 --> 00:01:00,502
<i>...I got exactly 38 minutes to get
to the airport, and I'm dictating.</i>

13
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,460
<i>There's this panicked associate
sprinting along beside me...</i>

14
00:01:03,627 --> 00:01:06,169
<i>...scribbling in a notepad,
and she starts screaming.</i>

15
00:01:06,335 --> 00:01:09,252
<i>And I realize we're standing
in the middle of the street...</i>

16
00:01:09,419 --> 00:01:13,419
<i>...the light's changed and there's this wall
of serious traffic speeding towards us.</i>

17
00:01:13,585 --> 00:01:15,627
<i>And I freeze. I can't move.</i>

18
00:01:15,794 --> 00:01:18,419
<i>I'm suddenly consumed with the overwhelming sensation...</i>

19
00:01:18,585 --> 00:01:20,627
<i>...that I'm covered
with some sort of film.</i>

20
00:01:20,794 --> 00:01:25,377
<i>And it's in my hair, in my face.
And it's like a glaze, like a coating.</i>

21
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:28,335
<i>And at first I thought, "Oh, my God, I know what this is.</i>

22
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:30,919
<i>This is some sort of amniotic, embryonic fluid.</i>

23
00:01:31,085 --> 00:01:32,794
<i>I'm drenched in afterbirth.</i>

24
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,627
<i>I've breached the chrysalis.
I've been reborn. "</i>

25
00:01:35,794 --> 00:01:39,085
<i>But then, the traffic, the stampede,
the cars, the trucks, the horns...</i>

26
00:01:39,252 --> 00:01:43,294
<i>...this poor woman screaming,
and I'm thinking, "No. This is not rebirth.</i>

27
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,335
<i>This is some kind of giddy illusion of renewal...</i>

28
00:01:46,502 --> 00:01:49,252
<i>...that happens in
the final moment before death. "</i>

29
00:01:49,419 --> 00:01:53,002
<i>And then I realize,
"No, no, no, this is completely wrong"...</i>

30
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,169
<i>...because I looked back
at the building...</i>

31
00:01:56,335 --> 00:01:58,960
<i>...and I had the most stunning
moment of clarity.</i>

32
00:01:59,127 --> 00:02:01,210
<i>I realized, Michael...</i>

33
00:02:01,377 --> 00:02:05,419
<i>...that I had emerged, not through
the doors of Kenner, Bach & Ledeen...</i>

34
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:08,877
<i>...not through the portals
of our vast and powerful law firm...</i>

35
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:11,877
<i>...but from the asshole of an organism...</i>

36
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:16,669
<i>...whose sole function is
to excrete the poison...</i>

37
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:20,210
<i>...the ammo, the defoliant necessary
for other larger...</i>

38
00:02:20,377 --> 00:02:23,919
<i>...more powerful organisms
to destroy the miracle of humanity.</i>

39
00:02:24,085 --> 00:02:27,960
<i>And that I had been coated in this patina of shit...</i>

40
00:02:28,127 --> 00:02:30,335
<i>...for the best part of my life.</i>

41
00:02:30,502 --> 00:02:34,335
<i>And the stench of it, the stain of it
would take the rest of my life to undo.</i>

42
00:02:34,502 --> 00:02:35,752
<i>And you know what I did?</i>

43
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:39,669
<i>I took a deep, cleansing breath
and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.</i>

44
00:02:39,835 --> 00:02:44,210
<i>I said to myself, "As clear as this may be,
as potent a feeling as this is...</i>

45
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:48,585
<i>...as true a thing as I believe
that I have witnessed today, it must wait.</i>

46
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,252
<i>It must stand the test of time. "</i>

47
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:54,419
<i>And, Michael, the time is now.</i>

48
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:59,919
I'm not sure what else I can tell you
that I haven't already.

49
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:02,585
<i>Tell me about U/North, Barry.
They're your clients.</i>

50
00:03:02,752 --> 00:03:07,002
<i>So you tell me why you're settling
a six-year-old case on the fly at midnight.</i>

51
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:09,877
<i>Because I'm writing this story whether you like it or not.</i>

52
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:11,377
What does that exactly mean?

53
00:03:11,544 --> 00:03:13,919
<i>Give me something I can print.</i>

54
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,710
We found 97.

55
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:32,377
<i>I've got that cunt from
The Wall Street Journal on my cell phone.</i>

56
00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:34,710
She will not go away.

57
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,710
Marty Bach. How can I help you?

58
00:03:39,877 --> 00:03:42,960
<i>Marty, hi. It's Bridget Klein.
We're going with a story tomorrow...</i>

59
00:03:43,127 --> 00:03:46,377
<i>...about a settlement in the U/North
defoliant case. You wanna comment?</i>

60
00:03:46,544 --> 00:03:49,919
Case you're referring to is now,
as it has been for the past six years...

61
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:51,919
...pending and unresolved.

62
00:03:52,085 --> 00:03:54,710
Till such time as our client has their day in court...

63
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:58,377
...or the plaintiffs drop the suit,
I'll have nothing of value to tell you.

64
00:03:58,544 --> 00:04:01,585
<i>Come on, Marty, you're closing
the U/North case. You're settling.</i>

65
00:04:01,752 --> 00:04:06,210
<i>I know that. I know you're up there with
600 people jamming this thing through.</i>

66
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:08,835
Here's what I know.
Your deadline was 20 minutes ago.

67
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:12,502
So you're fishing for a story or
trying to get out of writing a retraction.

68
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,169
In either case, I wish you the best of luck.

69
00:04:16,252 --> 00:04:18,294
Where the fuck is Karen Crowder?

70
00:05:07,252 --> 00:05:08,710
I'll see the turn.

71
00:05:14,752 --> 00:05:16,252
Check.

72
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:19,044
Check.

73
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,752
Check.

74
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:22,919
Half the pot. Two hundred.

75
00:05:23,127 --> 00:05:24,794
Two hundred to go.

76
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,169
You don't remember me, huh?

77
00:05:38,544 --> 00:05:40,669
We played together a couple times.

78
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:42,919
That lamp place on Bowery.

79
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:45,752
That guy's showroom?
All the lamps and shit?

80
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:48,335
- The Galaxy.
- That's it.

81
00:05:48,502 --> 00:05:51,710
You had a restaurant you were opening, right?

82
00:05:51,877 --> 00:05:55,085
My old partner bid that job, the plumbing.

83
00:05:55,794 --> 00:05:58,669
- You don't remember me?
- I remember you.

84
00:05:58,835 --> 00:06:01,085
Because I lost a lot of weight since then.

85
00:06:01,835 --> 00:06:03,585
You bought some hair too.

86
00:06:04,294 --> 00:06:06,085
With your money.

87
00:06:07,127 --> 00:06:09,335
So, what happened with the bar?

88
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,252
You just had to be a rock star, huh?

89
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,585
Shit, man. I want to listen to Larry King,
I go home and put the fucking TV on.

90
00:06:15,794 --> 00:06:18,252
That was a good location.

91
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,252
Yeah, that's what my partner kept telling me.

92
00:06:21,794 --> 00:06:23,210
Action's on you.

93
00:06:23,835 --> 00:06:25,585
I bet the pot.

94
00:06:28,335 --> 00:06:30,169
Good to see you again.

95
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,919
Hello?

96
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:05,377
<i>- Michael.
- Walter.</i>

97
00:07:05,544 --> 00:07:08,752
<i>Michael, thank God, there you are.
Look, I got a situation.</i>

98
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,044
<i>A big problem, all right? A client of mine,
he just called, he hit a guy with his car.</i>

99
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,127
<i>He thinks he did. He thinks he hit him.</i>

100
00:07:15,294 --> 00:07:16,252
Just now?

101
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,085
<i>Yeah, just now. Ten, 15 minutes ago.
He's driving home.</i>

102
00:07:19,294 --> 00:07:21,335
<i>He's home now. He's there waiting.</i>

103
00:07:21,502 --> 00:07:22,669
Where?

104
00:07:22,835 --> 00:07:26,669
<i>Westchester. I'm down here in Bermuda.
He just got me up. I'm half asleep here.</i>

105
00:07:26,835 --> 00:07:27,877
Is he drunk?

106
00:07:28,044 --> 00:07:30,919
<i>No. It's the first thing I asked him.
He's good, he's sober.</i>

107
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:32,585
Tell him to stay off the phone.

108
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:35,002
<i>All right. But you're on it?
You can get up there?</i>

109
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:36,960
<i>Because this guy, he's a huge client.</i>

110
00:07:37,502 --> 00:07:39,669
<i>This is half my book, this guy, okay?</i>

111
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,294
I'm walking to the car now.

112
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,794
<i>Okay. Look, look, let me call him right back
and I'll get the address.</i>

113
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,585
<i>Just let me know you're on the way,
and I'll get back to you with the details.</i>

114
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:50,169
All right. I'll be in the car.

115
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,460
<i>What they did, see, they changed the grade there.</i>

116
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:48,460
They widened the street.

117
00:08:48,627 --> 00:08:51,502
I'm sure somebody told them that that was an improvement.

118
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:56,169
But now, you see, when it rains and when
there is fog, and with this new angle...

119
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:59,960
...and they've got these new--
These-- These--

120
00:09:00,127 --> 00:09:02,210
These sodium lamps, it's blinding.

121
00:09:02,377 --> 00:09:05,627
- That corner there. It is blinding.
- They'll have to work that out.

122
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:08,627
And it's not just tonight.
I've been saying this for years.

123
00:09:08,835 --> 00:09:13,460
I mean, how many times have we talked
about that corner? Dell?

124
00:09:13,627 --> 00:09:15,877
Mr. Greer, we don't have
a lot of time here.

125
00:09:16,044 --> 00:09:21,002
So the circumstances, the road conditions,
none of this holds any interest for you?

126
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:24,044
What interests me is finding
the strongest criminal attorney...

127
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,794
...that can be here in 15 minutes.

128
00:09:26,377 --> 00:09:29,210
Well, that sounds ominous.

129
00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:31,960
We have some good relationships up here in Westchester.

130
00:09:32,127 --> 00:09:35,044
So, what are you? What are you?
You're not a lawyer?

131
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,002
- Not the kind you need.
- What kind is that?

132
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:38,169
A trial lawyer.

133
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,210
Somebody who can see this through.
That's not what I do.

134
00:09:41,377 --> 00:09:44,960
Okay. I think we're gonna have to
pull Walter back in on this.

135
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:48,127
I wanna get Walter back on the phone,
get him back into the mix.

136
00:09:48,294 --> 00:09:52,002
Because, I'll be frank with you,
I don't like the way this is going.

137
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:55,835
Sir, we don't have time for Walter.
Your options are gonna get smaller quickly.

138
00:09:56,002 --> 00:09:58,085
What options?
I'm not hearing any options!

139
00:09:58,252 --> 00:09:59,460
I suggest you go local...

140
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:02,502
...and I'm telling you there are
people here I like for this.

141
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,752
Great. That's it?
That's what you got for me?

142
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,960
Hey, you believe this?

143
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:09,419
I have been a client at Kenner, Bach for 12 years!

144
00:10:09,585 --> 00:10:13,294
You think I paid that retainer every month
for a place at the back of the line?

145
00:10:13,502 --> 00:10:16,794
Mr. Greer, you left the scene of an accident
on a slow weeknight...

146
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,127
...six miles from
the state police barracks.

147
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:21,544
If there's a line, you're right up front.

148
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,585
I can get a lawyer any time I want.
I don't need you for that.

149
00:10:24,752 --> 00:10:28,669
We're not sitting here for 45 minutes
waiting for a goddamn referral!

150
00:10:28,835 --> 00:10:30,585
I don't know what Walter
promised you--

151
00:10:30,752 --> 00:10:34,210
A miracle worker! That's Walter
on the phone, 20 minutes ago.

152
00:10:34,377 --> 00:10:37,460
Direct quote, okay? "Hang tight.
I'm sending you a miracle worker."

153
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:39,294
- Well, he misspoke.
- About what?

154
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,044
That you're the firm's fixer?
Or that you're good at it?

155
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,669
Elliot.

156
00:10:44,085 --> 00:10:47,127
The guy was running! In the street!

157
00:10:47,335 --> 00:10:52,044
You take that, you add the fog,
you add the lamps, you add the angle....

158
00:10:53,544 --> 00:10:57,044
What the fuck is he doing running in
the middle of the street at midnight?!

159
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,419
You answer me that!

160
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,127
What if someone had stolen the car?

161
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,460
Happens all the time.

162
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:21,710
Cops like hit-and-runs.

163
00:11:21,877 --> 00:11:23,919
They work them hard, they clear them fast.

164
00:11:24,085 --> 00:11:27,294
Right now there's a B.C.I. unit
pulling paint chips off a guard rail.

165
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,794
Tomorrow, they're gonna be looking
for the owner of a custom-painted...

166
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,169
...hand-rubbed Jaguar XJ-12.

167
00:11:33,335 --> 00:11:34,960
And the guy you hit?

168
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:38,502
If he got a look at the plates,
it won't even take that long.

169
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,419
There's no play here.

170
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,544
There's no angle.
There's no champagne room.

171
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,377
I'm not a miracle worker, I'm a janitor.

172
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:51,627
The math on this is simple.

173
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,794
The smaller the mess, the easier it is for me to clean up.

174
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,044
That's the police, isn't it?

175
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,627
No.

176
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,127
They don't call.

177
00:12:08,877 --> 00:12:10,210
Hello.

178
00:12:11,294 --> 00:12:13,585
Jerry, it's Michael Clayton.

179
00:12:13,752 --> 00:12:16,210
Yeah, look, I'm sorry to wake you up.

180
00:12:16,544 --> 00:12:19,294
No. I'm in the neighborhood.

181
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,502
You got a pen?

182
00:16:03,794 --> 00:16:05,877
Mom, where's my cards?

183
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,752
Where's my cards?

184
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,294
Is my other deck in here?

185
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,877
Did you eat?

186
00:16:30,044 --> 00:16:31,919
Dad's down there waiting already.

187
00:16:32,085 --> 00:16:33,960
There were cards in our bathroom.

188
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,377
Yes, I had a waffle.

189
00:16:35,585 --> 00:16:38,419
Since we're out of waffles,
I don't see how that's possible.

190
00:16:38,585 --> 00:16:39,919
It's a miracle.

191
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,210
Gloves?

192
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,044
Henry!

193
00:16:57,794 --> 00:16:59,210
Come on.

194
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,544
Get in.

195
00:17:04,794 --> 00:17:06,127
Got it?

196
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,544
<i>So no one's even sure exactly where they are...</i>

197
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,877
...because there's no borders
or landmarks or anything.

198
00:17:18,044 --> 00:17:20,752
And the town?
It's not even a town really.

199
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:24,127
It just is this camp where all these people
have gathered to hide.

200
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:25,294
Right.

201
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,919
All these deserters and guys
that got cut off from their armies.

202
00:17:29,085 --> 00:17:32,252
All these people that are hiding
in the woods, trying to stay alive.

203
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,335
This is where they all came.

204
00:17:34,502 --> 00:17:37,502
There's Thieves, Gray Mages, Unbidden Warriors...

205
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:39,710
...Dark Avians,
Riverwynders and Sappers.

206
00:17:39,877 --> 00:17:43,044
- There's, like, 15 different characters, okay?
- Okay.

207
00:17:43,502 --> 00:17:45,252
And nobody has any alliances.

208
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:48,669
You can't even say who you are because, you don't know...

209
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:50,835
...maybe the person you're talking to...

210
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:53,502
...maybe they're like your mortal enemy
in the wars.

211
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:56,377
So it's just completely like everybody for themselves.

212
00:17:56,544 --> 00:17:57,877
Sounds familiar.

213
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:00,960
It's really good.
I'm serious, you should really read it.

214
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:04,294
Right. But by the time I finish it,
you'll be on to something else.

215
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,252
- How much you wanna bet?
- I don't know. How much you got?

216
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,252
- You got your bus pass?
- It's in my locker.

217
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:13,252
You're not even gonna look at it, are you?

218
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,877
- The book?
- Yes.

219
00:18:15,044 --> 00:18:16,419
Bring it on Saturday, I'll....

220
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:19,835
I did already. I left it in your kitchen.
It's got a red cover.

221
00:18:20,002 --> 00:18:21,127
Okay.

222
00:18:21,294 --> 00:18:23,710
Well, here we go.

223
00:18:23,877 --> 00:18:26,585
Go. Teach these people something,
would you?

224
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:33,210
- See you later, Dad.
- Yeah, kiddo.

225
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:36,752
Thanks.

226
00:18:43,002 --> 00:18:46,544
<i>Lot 52, lot of assorted mixing bowls, assorted sizes.</i>

227
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,669
<i>Thirty dollars to start. Thirty dollars.
Thirty dollars I have.</i>

228
00:18:49,835 --> 00:18:52,919
You can get me to 40. I got 40. And 50.
Sixty dollars back there.

229
00:18:53,127 --> 00:18:55,335
Sixty dollars, get me to 70.
I got 70 dollars.

230
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:58,044
Seventy dollars, I have now, 70.
Eighty dollars there.

231
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,627
Eighty dollars, this gentleman here.
Eighty dollars.

232
00:19:00,794 --> 00:19:03,502
Ninety dollars there. Give me 100.
One hundred I have now.

233
00:19:15,127 --> 00:19:17,419
He says you're still gonna be short.

234
00:19:19,794 --> 00:19:21,294
How short?

235
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,877
Sixty. Plus the points, 75 thousand.

236
00:19:25,044 --> 00:19:28,085
- That's liquor and everything?
- What'd you think it was gonna be?

237
00:19:28,294 --> 00:19:31,252
I don't know. Less. Thirty. Twenty.

238
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,294
He took $ 1,500 on a refrigerator I paid four grand for.

239
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,085
Make a bid.

240
00:19:38,835 --> 00:19:41,335
Are you telling me you don't have the 75 thousand?

241
00:19:41,502 --> 00:19:43,585
Just lying around, no.

242
00:19:45,627 --> 00:19:48,169
We both know it's your brother I should be talking to.

243
00:19:48,335 --> 00:19:49,377
Forget that.

244
00:19:49,544 --> 00:19:53,835
Michael, look, you wanna front this, that's up to you.

245
00:19:54,002 --> 00:19:57,252
But Timmy's name stays in the book till we're clear.

246
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,002
If I know where he is, I don't have to keep asking.

247
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:05,877
He's upstate. His wife took him back.
I don't know where he is.

248
00:20:06,044 --> 00:20:07,835
He's gotta have something.

249
00:20:08,002 --> 00:20:09,502
He's got the two kids with her.

250
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:13,335
He's got Jennifer, the coke-dealing waitress
that he knocked up.

251
00:20:13,502 --> 00:20:18,169
He's got four Michelin radials
that he stole from my sister's garage.

252
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,252
Make an offer.

253
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,044
I had a wife who was a drunk.
She was a beautiful girl, young girl.

254
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:32,752
But live like that? Even they do a program--
She did, I think, once, two years.

255
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,919
And then they slip? Forget it.

256
00:20:35,127 --> 00:20:37,460
It's like you're strapped to a bomb.

257
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,627
What's my timeframe here?

258
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,960
I don't know.

259
00:20:43,127 --> 00:20:45,127
I didn't think it'd be a problem.

260
00:20:46,794 --> 00:20:48,252
I'll ask.

261
00:21:15,794 --> 00:21:17,960
- Hey, Michael.
- Morning, Carl.

262
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,460
I don't know. Del, I don't know
how hard you want me to press here.

263
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:31,627
Let me know how brave he wants to be.

264
00:21:31,835 --> 00:21:34,127
<i>Well, I'm not sure how brave he can be right now.</i>

265
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:36,627
<i>We just got a confirmation hearing scheduled.</i>

266
00:21:36,835 --> 00:21:38,210
Any chance she knows that?

267
00:21:38,377 --> 00:21:42,002
<i>Well, it was in the paper. Who knows?
Maybe she got someone to read it to her.</i>

268
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:44,710
<i>She called his wife yesterday.
She's calling his house.</i>

269
00:21:44,877 --> 00:21:46,127
<i>This is a total nightmare.</i>

270
00:21:46,294 --> 00:21:48,419
Well, my guess is she's gonna want the condo.

271
00:21:48,585 --> 00:21:49,627
<i>Come on, that's insane.</i>

272
00:21:49,835 --> 00:21:53,335
Well, what can I tell you?
Don't piss off a motivated stripper.

273
00:21:53,502 --> 00:21:54,710
<i>It's just unbelievable.</i>

274
00:21:54,877 --> 00:21:58,127
All right. Well, find out his pain threshold
and get back to me.

275
00:21:58,335 --> 00:22:00,210
Or you can tell him to call me directly.

276
00:22:00,377 --> 00:22:02,377
<i>All right, I hear you. Let me get into it.</i>

277
00:22:02,544 --> 00:22:03,710
Thanks.

278
00:22:03,877 --> 00:22:05,502
Hey, where are we with Marty?

279
00:22:06,502 --> 00:22:08,002
We left word.

280
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:10,335
Hold on. Go back. How old is the kid?

281
00:22:10,502 --> 00:22:12,502
<i>He's not a kid. He's 22.</i>

282
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:14,335
<i>- This is Miami?
- Nope. Key Biscayne.</i>

283
00:22:14,502 --> 00:22:16,002
And they charged him.

284
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:19,460
<i>Reckless endangerment. My client....</i>

285
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:25,085
<i>I think really what they want, they want
a reality check on the attorney down there.</i>

286
00:22:25,252 --> 00:22:27,294
<i>- Yeah.
- Wayne said you have some connections?</i>

287
00:22:27,502 --> 00:22:30,002
<i>- Yeah, let me get a pen.
- Thank you.</i>

288
00:22:30,794 --> 00:22:33,794
Now, if she calls the INS directly,
she's gonna get nowhere.

289
00:22:34,002 --> 00:22:35,210
<i>Even with the appointment?</i>

290
00:22:35,377 --> 00:22:37,877
It's retail, Evan.
It's like the DMV over there.

291
00:22:38,044 --> 00:22:41,377
Unless they get a call from
a district supervisor, then nobody moves.

292
00:22:41,544 --> 00:22:43,127
<i>But your guy can do that?</i>

293
00:22:43,294 --> 00:22:44,627
He's a former commissioner.

294
00:22:44,794 --> 00:22:47,710
<i>None of this comes back to me?
Because that doesn't do any good.</i>

295
00:22:47,877 --> 00:22:49,960
No, look, I'm gonna be the one that's asking.

296
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:52,502
<i>- Can you hang on a minute?
- Yeah, sure.</i>

297
00:22:54,294 --> 00:22:55,585
Are we merging?

298
00:22:56,544 --> 00:22:58,252
Marty Bach's in London.

299
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:01,502
They said he was in Atlanta,
then Lara said he was in the building.

300
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:03,794
So I called back.
I know you want this meeting.

301
00:23:04,002 --> 00:23:06,544
Now she tells me the truth.
He's really in London.

302
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,919
So are we merging?
I mean, that's what everyone's saying.

303
00:23:10,085 --> 00:23:12,210
All these Brits?
That this time it's for real.

304
00:23:12,377 --> 00:23:14,169
Like I would know.

305
00:23:14,835 --> 00:23:16,044
I don't know.

306
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,877
But even if we are, I mean, even if
they merged, it wouldn't affect us, right?

307
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:22,294
Your phone's ringing.

308
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:24,669
Evan?

309
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:28,169
Hey. Okay, here's what I'll do.

310
00:23:28,335 --> 00:23:31,335
Let me give him a call and set up a meeting for next week.

311
00:23:31,502 --> 00:23:33,877
I'll walk her in, I'll make the introduction....

312
00:23:34,044 --> 00:23:37,627
<i>At the moment, U/North currently has 70,000 employees...</i>

313
00:23:37,794 --> 00:23:40,794
<i>...in 62 countries around the world.</i>

314
00:23:42,377 --> 00:23:44,002
<i>Around the planet.</i>

315
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:48,877
<i>Operating in 62 countries around the planet.</i>

316
00:23:50,002 --> 00:23:54,710
At work in more than 60 countries around the globe.

317
00:23:57,127 --> 00:24:00,544
We have-- We have, right now--
We have--

318
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,960
At U/North right now, we've got 75,000 employees...

319
00:24:04,127 --> 00:24:06,877
...in over 60 countries around the planet.

320
00:24:07,044 --> 00:24:09,835
We are a very successful and highly diversified company...

321
00:24:10,002 --> 00:24:11,710
...so you can imagine...

322
00:24:11,877 --> 00:24:15,335
...the volume and the variety
of legal issues we have to deal with is--

323
00:24:15,502 --> 00:24:16,960
Overwhelming.

324
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:20,335
It's just enormous.

325
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:24,169
So you can imagine, the volume of legal issues....

326
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,710
It's quite substantial.

327
00:24:27,877 --> 00:24:30,502
<i>And as general counsel, what I do...</i>

328
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,835
...what our in-house department does...

329
00:24:33,044 --> 00:24:38,294
...is to analyze the dimension
of the problem or the opportunity...

330
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,794
...to determine the jurisdiction...

331
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,169
...and to outsource our business...

332
00:24:43,377 --> 00:24:46,794
...to those firms and talents
that we think can help us the most.

333
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,835
<i>So with all that pressure and workload...</i>

334
00:24:50,044 --> 00:24:53,335
<i>...how do you keep a balance
between work and life?</i>

335
00:24:53,544 --> 00:24:55,002
<i>Balance?</i>

336
00:24:57,544 --> 00:25:00,835
I think that's.... That's something that...

337
00:25:01,002 --> 00:25:04,335
...you search for your whole life, isn't it?

338
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:07,294
It's a shifting balance, really.

339
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,627
It's, you know, you.... You try to....

340
00:25:10,794 --> 00:25:14,085
<i>When you really are enjoying what it is you do...</i>

341
00:25:14,252 --> 00:25:16,127
...who needs balance?

342
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:19,710
There's your balance.
There's your balance.

343
00:25:19,877 --> 00:25:23,835
When you're really enjoying
what it is you do, there is your balance.

344
00:25:24,044 --> 00:25:26,169
When Don asked me to take--

345
00:25:26,377 --> 00:25:28,835
When Don Jeffries brought--
Don Jeffries brought me--

346
00:25:29,002 --> 00:25:31,960
Don Jeffries brought me in here 12 years ago...

347
00:25:32,127 --> 00:25:35,210
...trusted me, mentored me.

348
00:25:35,377 --> 00:25:38,377
Welcomed me into the U/North family.

349
00:25:39,044 --> 00:25:42,877
And when he moved up to the boardroom, I never really...

350
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:47,169
...dreamt that I would have
the opportunity to move into his position.

351
00:25:47,377 --> 00:25:50,127
But, is it challenging? Yes.

352
00:25:50,294 --> 00:25:55,960
And I think that it's possible that those
first few months were a little shaky.

353
00:25:56,127 --> 00:26:01,210
But then you realize that you've been
taught to be ready, and you take the helm.

354
00:26:01,377 --> 00:26:05,377
Because if you're not comfortable
with that level of responsibility...

355
00:26:05,544 --> 00:26:07,377
...you're in the wrong place.

356
00:26:07,544 --> 00:26:12,669
It's your department, your capacity to
make tough decisions in real time, and--

357
00:26:13,502 --> 00:26:15,252
We're in the middle of an interview.

358
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:17,377
They said it was urgent.

359
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:20,877
Jesus.

360
00:26:21,544 --> 00:26:23,377
For chrissake.

361
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:26,794
You're saying he did this in--?

362
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,002
Oh, my God.

363
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:30,835
- Barry.
- Hang on.

364
00:26:31,377 --> 00:26:36,502
Arthur Edens just stripped down naked
in a deposition room in Milwaukee.

365
00:26:38,502 --> 00:26:39,835
<i>Oh, Michael...</i>

366
00:26:40,002 --> 00:26:43,669
<i>...I took a deep, cleansing breath
and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.</i>

367
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:48,627
<i>I said to myself, "As clear as this may be,
as potent a feeling as this is...</i>

368
00:26:48,794 --> 00:26:52,544
<i>...as true a thing as I believe
that I have witnessed today, it must wait.</i>

369
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,710
<i>It must stand the test of time. "</i>

370
00:26:55,877 --> 00:26:58,669
<i>And, Michael, the time is now.</i>

371
00:26:58,835 --> 00:27:02,294
<i>This moment, today, here, this room, this air...</i>

372
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,877
<i>...and this, especially this, Michael,
that you're here.</i>

373
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:08,835
<i>There's a reason.</i>

374
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,710
<i>A reason it's you, Michael.</i>

375
00:27:10,877 --> 00:27:15,335
<i>Surely, you have some sense of that,
how it pulls together, how it gathers.</i>

376
00:27:15,544 --> 00:27:19,252
<i>Nurse Michael, the secret hero,
the keeper of the hidden sins.</i>

377
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:21,710
<i>Tell me you can see that, Michael, for God's sake.</i>

378
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:27,002
But, I mean, yeah, yes, yes.
The nudity, the parking lot, I admit it.

379
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:30,877
It was-- It was-- It was a mistake.
It was wrong. It was lame.

380
00:27:31,044 --> 00:27:34,127
It was obvious. And therapeutically,
it was completely useless...

381
00:27:34,294 --> 00:27:37,669
...because I swear, I could stand here
and tear off my fucking skin...

382
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:42,544
...and I could not get down
to where this thing is living.

383
00:27:42,752 --> 00:27:46,460
Six years, Michael.
Six years I've absorbed this poison.

384
00:27:46,627 --> 00:27:49,877
Four hundred depositions,
a hundred motions, five changes of venue...

385
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,502
...85,000 documents in discovery.

386
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:56,877
Six years of scheming and stalling
and screaming, and what have I got?

387
00:27:57,044 --> 00:28:01,502
I've spent 12% of my life defending
the reputation of a deadly weed killer!

388
00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:03,752
- We had an agreement, Arthur.
- One night.

389
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,877
One night, right?
I look up and there's Marty in my office.

390
00:28:07,044 --> 00:28:08,377
He's got some champagne.

391
00:28:08,544 --> 00:28:13,294
He tells me we just hit 30,000 billable hours
on U/North and he wants to celebrate.

392
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,002
So an hour later, I find myself
in a whorehouse in Chelsea...

393
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:20,585
...with two Lithuanian redheads
taking turns sucking my dick.

394
00:28:20,752 --> 00:28:24,835
I'm laying there and I'm trying not
to come and I wanna....

395
00:28:25,002 --> 00:28:27,294
I wanna make it last, so I start doing the math.

396
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,710
I think, "Thirty thousand hours,
what is that? That's 24 times 30.

397
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:35,960
That's 720 hours in a month,
8760 hours in a year...."

398
00:28:36,127 --> 00:28:37,710
- Arthur.
- No, wait, wait, wait!

399
00:28:37,877 --> 00:28:41,210
Because it's years! It's lives!

400
00:28:41,377 --> 00:28:44,210
And the numbers are making me dizzy and, you know...

401
00:28:44,377 --> 00:28:48,544
...now, instead of trying not to come,
I'm trying not to think, and I can't stop.

402
00:28:48,752 --> 00:28:50,127
I mean, is this me?

403
00:28:50,294 --> 00:28:54,627
Am I this freak organism that has been
sent here to sleep and eat...

404
00:28:54,794 --> 00:28:59,002
...and defend this one horrific chain
of carcinogenic molecules?

405
00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:01,169
Is that my destiny? Is that my fate?

406
00:29:01,335 --> 00:29:03,585
- Listen, you promised me.
- Is that it, Michael?

407
00:29:03,752 --> 00:29:06,710
Is that my grail?
Two Lithuanian mouths on my cock?

408
00:29:06,877 --> 00:29:09,419
Is that the correct answer to the multiple choice of me?

409
00:29:09,585 --> 00:29:12,794
You wanna go off your medication,
that's fine. But you call me first.

410
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,627
- That was our agreement.
- Sue me.

411
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,002
We okay in there?

412
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,710
We're fine. We're fine.

413
00:29:23,252 --> 00:29:25,377
They killed them, Michael.

414
00:29:25,544 --> 00:29:28,752
Those small farms, the family farms.

415
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:31,419
Did you--? Did you--?
Did you meet Anna?

416
00:29:31,585 --> 00:29:32,627
No.

417
00:29:32,794 --> 00:29:35,877
You gotta see her, you gotta talk to her.
She's a miracle, Michael.

418
00:29:36,085 --> 00:29:38,044
She's God's perfect little creature.

419
00:29:38,252 --> 00:29:41,669
And for 50 million dollars in fees,
I've spent 12% of my life...

420
00:29:41,835 --> 00:29:45,460
...destroying perfect Anna
and her dead parents and her dying brother.

421
00:29:45,627 --> 00:29:47,419
When did you last take one of these?

422
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:50,294
No. I'm not losing this.
Everything is finally significant.

423
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,919
The world is a beautiful place.
I'm not trading that.

424
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:56,335
- If it's real, the pill won't kill it.
- I have blood on my hands.

425
00:29:56,502 --> 00:29:59,169
You are senior litigating partner of one of the largest...

426
00:29:59,335 --> 00:30:02,044
...most respected law firms in the world.
You are a legend.

427
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,544
- I'm an accomplice!
- You're a manic-depressive.

428
00:30:05,044 --> 00:30:08,002
I am Shiva, the god of death.

429
00:30:08,419 --> 00:30:11,377
Let's get out of Milwaukee, we'll talk about it.

430
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:17,544
<i>We came back from the hospital and everybody was crying...</i>

431
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:21,710
<i>...and we were in shock, but we still....
We had to milk.</i>

432
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,335
<i>The cows won't wait, will they?</i>

433
00:30:24,502 --> 00:30:25,502
<i>No.</i>

434
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,710
<i>And when you went to the barn?</i>

435
00:30:28,877 --> 00:30:31,460
<i>We found the note. My sister found it.</i>

436
00:30:31,627 --> 00:30:33,877
<i>- From your mother?
- Yes.</i>

437
00:30:34,044 --> 00:30:36,044
<i>Could you read it for us, please?</i>

438
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:40,377
<i>Just read the third paragraph,
just the highlighted section there.</i>

439
00:30:41,127 --> 00:30:43,794
<i>"I don't want you blaming Ned Hardy
or any of the people-- "</i>

440
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,210
<i>Anna.</i>

441
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,627
<i>- Anna.
- "Down at--</i>

442
00:30:47,794 --> 00:30:49,460
<i>It's all right, Anna, go on.</i>

443
00:30:49,627 --> 00:30:51,544
<i>- I'm just....
- Excuse me.</i>

444
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,794
<i>- Anna, they're....
- What's he doing?</i>

445
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,669
<i>Excuse me. She's a--
No, this is testimony. This is--</i>

446
00:30:56,835 --> 00:30:58,835
<i>Excuse me, I have an objection.</i>

447
00:30:59,002 --> 00:31:01,377
<i>You can be a witness here.
You can be a witness.</i>

448
00:31:01,544 --> 00:31:03,252
<i>I am not a witness to this, sir, I--</i>

449
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:06,002
<i>Anna, I love you.</i>

450
00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:11,085
<i>And I'm sitting here
and I'm listening to you and I swear...</i>

451
00:31:11,252 --> 00:31:16,002
<i>...that I love you more than anything
in the world. And this is my moment.</i>

452
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:19,960
<i>This strange conference-table moment.</i>

453
00:31:20,127 --> 00:31:22,044
<i>Turn off that camera!</i>

454
00:31:22,627 --> 00:31:26,085
<i>- This is my offering!
- No, I want this on the record!</i>

455
00:31:26,294 --> 00:31:27,502
<i>How do I turn it off?</i>

456
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:31,210
<i>This is my offering. My clothes are
my offering. This is my shame.</i>

457
00:31:31,377 --> 00:31:34,127
<i>My credentials! I'm ashamed!</i>

458
00:31:34,294 --> 00:31:37,710
<i>And I love you, and I swear to God--</i>

459
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:46,960
I guess that's it.

460
00:31:54,127 --> 00:31:55,460
When do we get Don?

461
00:31:56,044 --> 00:31:58,585
She said to try back in half an hour.

462
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:01,627
And how about the flights?
What's the story at O'Hare?

463
00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:05,502
- Closed four minutes ago.
- Shit.

464
00:32:06,877 --> 00:32:09,294
There is a foot of snow in Detroit already.

465
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,710
Todd, could I get that coffee now?

466
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,044
Who is this guy they sent from New York?
Clayton? I never heard of him.

467
00:32:19,835 --> 00:32:21,294
Michael Raymond Clayton.

468
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:26,335
<i>Born September 9, 1959,
St. Joseph's Hospital, Bronx, New York.</i>

469
00:32:26,502 --> 00:32:30,210
<i>Father is NYPD patrolman Raymond Xavier Clayton.</i>

470
00:32:30,377 --> 00:32:33,044
<i>Mother, Alice Mary Clayton.</i>

471
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,377
<i>Graduates Washingtonville Central
High School, Orange County, New York...</i>

472
00:32:36,544 --> 00:32:38,169
<i>...in 1977.</i>

473
00:32:38,335 --> 00:32:42,710
<i>Graduates St. John's University, 1980.
Fordham Law, '82.</i>

474
00:32:43,377 --> 00:32:47,877
<i>'82 through '86, he's ADA with
the Queens district attorney's office.</i>

475
00:32:48,044 --> 00:32:50,960
<i>1986, he's with
the Joint Manhattan-Queens...</i>

476
00:32:51,127 --> 00:32:53,085
<i>...Organized Crime Task Force.</i>

477
00:32:53,252 --> 00:32:56,627
And then in 1990, he starts at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.

478
00:32:56,794 --> 00:32:58,252
So he's a partner?

479
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:01,627
No. He's listed as special counsel.

480
00:33:01,794 --> 00:33:03,835
Says he specializes in wills and trusts.

481
00:33:04,752 --> 00:33:07,377
<i>He goes from criminal prosecution to wills and trusts?</i>

482
00:33:07,544 --> 00:33:09,919
<i>He's been there 17 years, he's not a partner?</i>

483
00:33:10,085 --> 00:33:13,752
<i>This is the guy they send?
Who is this guy?</i>

484
00:33:28,002 --> 00:33:30,252
- Hi.
- Close the door.

485
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:34,710
All right. So nobody, none of you,
had any idea he was coming?

486
00:33:35,294 --> 00:33:37,127
To Milwaukee? For a deposition?

487
00:33:37,335 --> 00:33:40,877
We thought there was a settlement.
There's been some rumors.

488
00:33:41,044 --> 00:33:45,627
Okay. Look, it's very simple.
Arthur has a chemical imbalance.

489
00:33:45,835 --> 00:33:49,669
He's supposed to be taking his medication.
He's fallen behind on that.

490
00:33:49,835 --> 00:33:52,335
He's on the mend.
He'll be fine in three or four days.

491
00:33:52,502 --> 00:33:56,669
Now, I wanna make this crystal clear.
What happened here stays in this room.

492
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:59,835
This is not a piece of information
you wanna be out in front of.

493
00:34:00,002 --> 00:34:03,294
Anybody has a problem with that, I need to know right now.

494
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:05,794
All right.

495
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,460
We're stuck here overnight.

496
00:34:08,669 --> 00:34:10,960
I'm gonna take him home tomorrow if I can.

497
00:34:11,127 --> 00:34:13,085
Who's in charge of the deposition schedule?

498
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:14,919
- I am.
- Where do we stand with that?

499
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:17,294
I guess it's on hold.
We didn't know what to do.

500
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,502
Nothing is on hold.
Keep doing what you were.

501
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:21,960
Other side wants to talk, they can call New York.

502
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:25,169
- I need his briefcase.
- Arthur's? I don't-- I didn't see it.

503
00:34:25,335 --> 00:34:28,460
- He said it was in the room.
- It might be the stuff Jody grabbed.

504
00:34:28,835 --> 00:34:30,419
Find it.

505
00:34:36,377 --> 00:34:40,669
So all these people, they all start
having these dreams, okay?

506
00:34:40,835 --> 00:34:45,252
You know what a vision quest is?
You know, for, like, Navajos and stuff?

507
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:48,669
<i>Yeah. I think so. Like a....</i>

508
00:34:49,044 --> 00:34:50,919
<i>Like a special dream.</i>

509
00:34:51,085 --> 00:34:55,627
Except this is like a whole bunch of people
having the same dream.

510
00:34:55,835 --> 00:34:59,210
They're all having this dream
that they should go to this one place.

511
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:01,419
They don't know why or anything.

512
00:35:01,585 --> 00:35:04,710
They just have this feeling that they have to go there.

513
00:35:04,877 --> 00:35:06,752
<i>That they've been summoned.</i>

514
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:08,127
That's the chapter.

515
00:35:08,335 --> 00:35:11,294
Seriously, that's what it's called:
"Summons to Conquest."

516
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,752
<i>That's the title.</i>

517
00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:18,585
Yeah, but do they know? Do they know
they're all having the same dream?

518
00:35:18,752 --> 00:35:20,710
<i>No. That's what's so cool.</i>

519
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:23,169
They all think it's just them.

520
00:35:23,335 --> 00:35:27,419
That maybe they're, like, going crazy
or something, so they don't wanna admit it.

521
00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:29,710
Yeah, but they're not crazy, are they?

522
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:33,377
<i>No. It's real. It's really happening.</i>

523
00:35:33,544 --> 00:35:37,169
Yeah, it is happening, isn't it?

524
00:35:38,377 --> 00:35:43,044
Something larger than themselves
and they're not ready, are they...

525
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,002
...to hear it?

526
00:35:45,169 --> 00:35:47,085
Yeah. But later they will.

527
00:35:47,252 --> 00:35:50,085
So if you're gonna read it, I don't wanna spoil it.

528
00:35:51,669 --> 00:35:53,502
What are you doing?
Who you talking to?

529
00:35:53,669 --> 00:35:55,669
<i>I called my dad. It's a friend of his.</i>

530
00:35:55,835 --> 00:35:59,085
<i>- Who?
- Mr. Edens. You don't know him.</i>

531
00:35:59,252 --> 00:36:01,919
<i>- Hello? Hello?
- Henry, it's after 11.</i>

532
00:36:02,085 --> 00:36:03,877
<i>I gotta get off now.</i>

533
00:36:04,044 --> 00:36:08,044
No. Wait, wait. The book.
I need the book. The title.

534
00:36:08,669 --> 00:36:10,877
<i>The book is Realm and Conquest.</i>

535
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:12,835
Realm and Conquest.

536
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:16,044
- It's Book One, with the red cover.
- Henry, give me the phone.

537
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,794
I gotta go. Tell my dad I called. Okay?

538
00:36:19,669 --> 00:36:24,044
Yeah. Yeah. Thank-- Thank-- Thank--
Thank you, Henry, thank you.

539
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:31,669
<i>Realm and Conquest. Thank you.</i>

540
00:36:54,877 --> 00:36:56,919
Karen? Hi, I'm Michael Clayton.

541
00:36:57,085 --> 00:36:58,544
- You're late.
- I know.

542
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,252
I'm sorry, it was more complicated than we thought.

543
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,127
Where is he?
We've been here since 5:30.

544
00:37:03,294 --> 00:37:05,460
- He's asleep.
- Well, wake him up.

545
00:37:05,627 --> 00:37:07,877
That's not gonna happen.
We just got him sedated.

546
00:37:08,377 --> 00:37:11,419
Once he gets back on his regular medication...

547
00:37:11,585 --> 00:37:13,544
...then it's just a matter of time.

548
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,460
- Have you seen the video? The tape?
- I heard about it.

549
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,210
What happened after is worse.

550
00:37:19,377 --> 00:37:23,252
This is in the parking lot, okay?
People running for their cars.

551
00:37:23,419 --> 00:37:25,544
He's there in his socks, nothing else.

552
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,377
"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I will not sit with this sickness any longer.

553
00:37:29,544 --> 00:37:32,335
I cannot aid this sickness any longer."

554
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,127
What does this mean?

555
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,085
I'm not sure.

556
00:37:36,252 --> 00:37:38,877
You've been with him the whole evening.
What's he saying?

557
00:37:39,044 --> 00:37:40,835
He wasn't really making much sense.

558
00:37:41,044 --> 00:37:42,585
This is totally unacceptable.

559
00:37:42,752 --> 00:37:45,710
This is a 3-billion-dollar
class-action lawsuit.

560
00:37:45,877 --> 00:37:47,794
In the morning, I have to call my board.

561
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,502
I have to tell them that the architect
of our entire defense has been arrested...

562
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:56,835
...for running naked in a snowstorm,
chasing the plaintiffs through a parking lot.

563
00:37:57,044 --> 00:37:58,835
I understand.

564
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:01,919
What sickness is he talking about?

565
00:38:02,085 --> 00:38:04,710
- I don't know. It could be anything.
- Well, give me one.

566
00:38:04,877 --> 00:38:06,210
Frostbite.

567
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,335
You think this is funny?

568
00:38:08,502 --> 00:38:10,752
Look, his wife was sick and she died last year.

569
00:38:10,919 --> 00:38:15,377
His daughter doesn't talk to him.
He's all alone. All he does is your case.

570
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:18,252
He skipped his pills.
He had a bad day. That's it.

571
00:38:18,419 --> 00:38:21,127
And you're somehow the authority on this?

572
00:38:21,835 --> 00:38:24,335
His last episode was eight years ago.
I was there.

573
00:38:24,544 --> 00:38:27,377
I helped bring him home.
I watched him get better. That's it.

574
00:38:27,544 --> 00:38:31,294
Come on, Karen, you didn't hire this guy
because of his low-key regularity...

575
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,460
...you hired him because he's a killer,
because he's brilliant...

576
00:38:34,627 --> 00:38:37,294
...because he's crazy enough
to grind away on this case...

577
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:40,210
- ...for six years without a break.
- We pay for his time.

578
00:38:40,377 --> 00:38:42,419
I thought you wanted an explanation.

579
00:38:42,585 --> 00:38:45,335
In the morning, I'm calling Marty Bach.

580
00:38:45,502 --> 00:38:48,502
But, then, you know that.
Thank you, Michael.

581
00:38:54,377 --> 00:38:56,502
He was mostly just quiet.

582
00:38:56,669 --> 00:38:59,544
I heard him moving around,
I gave him a pill 15 minutes ago.

583
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:02,169
- He took it?
- A deal's a deal, right?

584
00:39:02,377 --> 00:39:04,085
A super job, Elston.

585
00:39:04,252 --> 00:39:07,919
You get to New York, you need tickets
to the game or anything, you let me know.

586
00:39:08,085 --> 00:39:09,544
I'll do that for sure.

587
00:39:29,877 --> 00:39:31,544
Did you see her?

588
00:39:31,877 --> 00:39:34,044
- Who?
- Anna.

589
00:39:34,585 --> 00:39:35,960
No.

590
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:40,669
No, I didn't see her.
She probably went back to the farm.

591
00:39:41,585 --> 00:39:43,210
Well, we need her.

592
00:39:45,085 --> 00:39:49,877
Marty, even then, and the rest of them,
they won't understand.

593
00:39:50,919 --> 00:39:54,460
Well, if anybody can explain it to them, it's you, Arthur.

594
00:39:56,169 --> 00:39:58,377
No, they're lost.

595
00:39:58,544 --> 00:40:01,585
- They have what they want.
- Let it go, man.

596
00:40:01,752 --> 00:40:03,585
This what you wanted?

597
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,669
To be a janitor?

598
00:40:07,169 --> 00:40:10,210
Live like this? All this?

599
00:40:11,044 --> 00:40:12,710
Do what you do?

600
00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:15,502
It can't be.

601
00:40:16,377 --> 00:40:17,377
It's....

602
00:40:17,585 --> 00:40:21,210
It's a burden, that's what I'm trying to tell you.

603
00:40:21,835 --> 00:40:23,960
That's-- That's how it feels.

604
00:40:24,919 --> 00:40:29,585
Well, I know that we've been summoned.

605
00:40:31,377 --> 00:40:33,210
Get some sleep.

606
00:40:49,085 --> 00:40:50,085
<i>Hello?</i>

607
00:40:50,252 --> 00:40:54,044
Yes. Hi, I'm looking for Verne?

608
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:56,419
<i>You have a number?</i>

609
00:40:56,585 --> 00:40:59,710
Don Jeffries gave me the number.
He said I could call at any time.

610
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:01,752
<i>No. The account number.</i>

611
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:06,085
The code? I do.
I have it right here. One moment.

612
00:41:08,044 --> 00:41:10,044
Excuse me one moment.

613
00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:14,085
It's right here. 12-BKR-6.

614
00:41:14,252 --> 00:41:16,335
12-BKR-6.

615
00:41:17,752 --> 00:41:19,752
Am I speaking with Verne?

616
00:41:20,877 --> 00:41:22,169
<i>It's Mr. Verne.</i>

617
00:41:22,335 --> 00:41:25,669
Mr. Verne. I'm sorry, it's so late.

618
00:41:25,835 --> 00:41:27,835
Don said that I could....

619
00:41:29,544 --> 00:41:31,752
I'm not exactly sure how this works.

620
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:33,919
<i>Do you have e-mail
at your current location?</i>

621
00:41:34,085 --> 00:41:35,335
I do.

622
00:41:35,502 --> 00:41:37,669
<i>- Are you alone?
- I am.</i>

623
00:41:38,419 --> 00:41:42,669
<i>Okay, I'm gonna upload you
a little encryption package we like to use.</i>

624
00:41:42,835 --> 00:41:44,252
<i>It's pretty self-explanatory.</i>

625
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:45,710
<i>- Okay.
- Okay.</i>

626
00:41:45,877 --> 00:41:48,835
<i>But you have to give me a minute
to get to my desk. Hold on.</i>

627
00:41:49,002 --> 00:41:50,710
Okay. Thank you.

628
00:42:14,919 --> 00:42:17,585
<i>What I was wondering is...</i>

629
00:42:17,752 --> 00:42:20,585
...I have an option on the lease
for six more years.

630
00:42:20,752 --> 00:42:23,419
I was wondering if there's any way I could lay that off.

631
00:42:23,585 --> 00:42:26,585
Is the lease worth anything?

632
00:42:30,085 --> 00:42:32,544
Eighty-nine hundred a month. It's--

633
00:42:33,002 --> 00:42:35,752
The fixtures are gone, but there's--

634
00:42:37,419 --> 00:42:40,627
But there's the bar, there's a kitchen,
it's a great space.

635
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:43,752
But there's a--

636
00:42:48,085 --> 00:42:51,169
Yeah, I understand. No, I understand.

637
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,044
Okay, yeah, I will.

638
00:42:55,669 --> 00:42:57,210
All right. Thanks.

639
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:09,127
Come on, Arthur.

640
00:43:11,752 --> 00:43:13,044
Arthur!

641
00:43:14,502 --> 00:43:15,585
Arthur, open the door.

642
00:43:19,169 --> 00:43:21,044
Arthur, open the door!

643
00:43:23,877 --> 00:43:26,252
Arthur, open the goddamn door!

644
00:43:27,585 --> 00:43:28,835
Arthur, op--!

645
00:43:29,627 --> 00:43:31,752
Open the fucking door!

646
00:43:38,127 --> 00:43:39,585
Arthur!

647
00:43:40,377 --> 00:43:43,002
Goddamn it, Arthur! Open the fucking--!

648
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,627
Arthur?!

649
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,752
- Mr. Verne, hey.
- Hey, Danny.

650
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,210
You guys are early.
I was pulling the other bags.

651
00:44:10,377 --> 00:44:13,252
You can put them back.
There's been a change of plans, sorry.

652
00:44:13,419 --> 00:44:15,294
- We ready?
- Yep.

653
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,502
For chrissake.

654
00:44:21,669 --> 00:44:23,544
Don Jeffries signed this?

655
00:44:24,002 --> 00:44:26,585
That's really his signature?

656
00:44:26,752 --> 00:44:28,710
Where's the original?

657
00:44:28,877 --> 00:44:33,919
We had a warehouse fire five years ago.
We lost a number of documents.

658
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,919
What the hell is this doing in Arthur's bag?

659
00:44:43,544 --> 00:44:45,085
Well, I don't know, Marty.

660
00:44:45,252 --> 00:44:49,210
That's something I was hoping
you might be able to tell me.

661
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,544
What are we looking for?

662
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:59,919
If it says U/North, pull it aside.
Anything that says U/North.

663
00:45:01,377 --> 00:45:02,877
What a mess this is.

664
00:45:07,502 --> 00:45:08,752
I want all this...

665
00:45:09,669 --> 00:45:13,752
...everything here, I want it all packed up
and sent up to the house.

666
00:45:14,877 --> 00:45:16,294
Any luck, Michael?

667
00:45:17,002 --> 00:45:21,127
He booked a limo from Newark Airport at 3,
got out at West Fourth Street...

668
00:45:21,294 --> 00:45:23,252
...tipped the driver 100 bucks
and walked away.

669
00:45:23,419 --> 00:45:24,627
Did you try his apartment?

670
00:45:24,794 --> 00:45:25,919
- He moved.
- I know.

671
00:45:26,127 --> 00:45:28,460
It's a loft. No doorman.
I rang, nobody answered.

672
00:45:28,627 --> 00:45:31,294
- I called, I got the machine.
- So he could be anywhere.

673
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:34,460
Arthur downtown is not a good idea.
Some goddamn loft.

674
00:45:34,627 --> 00:45:37,377
- Where's his daughter?
- I don't know. Spain, lndia.

675
00:45:37,544 --> 00:45:40,669
Mars. She's crazier than he'll ever be.

676
00:45:40,835 --> 00:45:42,669
Barry's taking over on U/North.

677
00:45:42,835 --> 00:45:44,627
We got a lot of groveling to do.

678
00:45:44,794 --> 00:45:46,919
You didn't exactly charm Karen Crowder.

679
00:45:47,085 --> 00:45:48,294
I was punting.

680
00:45:48,502 --> 00:45:51,127
You gotta saddle up here and get things under control.

681
00:45:51,335 --> 00:45:52,294
Saddle up?

682
00:45:52,502 --> 00:45:55,544
He needs to be under a doctor's care.
He needs to be admitted.

683
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:58,044
- Where?
- Does that really matter?

684
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:01,127
Michael, U/North needs to know he's under control.

685
00:46:01,294 --> 00:46:04,627
He's in a facility. They've been shook up.
They need to be reassured.

686
00:46:04,835 --> 00:46:07,002
- It's not gonna be that easy.
- Why the hell not?

687
00:46:07,169 --> 00:46:10,960
Because the laws in New York are
pretty tough on involuntary commitment.

688
00:46:11,169 --> 00:46:12,710
Did you see this fucking tape?

689
00:46:12,877 --> 00:46:15,585
I'm not arguing with you, Barry.
I'm telling you how it is.

690
00:46:15,752 --> 00:46:18,877
You know what, guys?
We got 600 lawyers in this place.

691
00:46:19,044 --> 00:46:22,544
Why don't we find out which one knows
about psychiatric-commitment statutes?

692
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:25,377
I can tell you that right now. It's Arthur.

693
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,044
<i>I'm at the door. We're good to go.</i>

694
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:43,877
Yeah, roger that.
Let's keep a radio check every five, okay?

695
00:46:44,044 --> 00:46:46,210
Every five minutes, copy that.

696
00:47:22,294 --> 00:47:24,377
<i>Hello, you've reached Arthur's machine.</i>

697
00:47:24,544 --> 00:47:27,794
<i>If you wish to leave a message,
please do so after the tone.</i>

698
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,210
<i>Arthur, pick up the phone.</i>

699
00:47:31,377 --> 00:47:35,794
<i>Arthur, pick up the phone and talk to me.</i>

700
00:47:37,627 --> 00:47:40,585
<i>No? Not gonna do it?</i>

701
00:47:41,377 --> 00:47:44,460
What happened yesterday morning,
forget it. It doesn't matter.

702
00:47:44,669 --> 00:47:46,710
Someday you and I are gonna laugh about it.

703
00:47:46,877 --> 00:47:48,335
But you gotta call me back.

704
00:47:48,502 --> 00:47:50,919
You gotta call me back soon, Arthur.

705
00:47:51,252 --> 00:47:53,169
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>

706
00:47:53,335 --> 00:47:56,335
<i>Because you said it yourself.
Part of this is definitely madness.</i>

707
00:47:56,502 --> 00:47:58,877
<i>And there's a chemical part.
We both know it.</i>

708
00:47:59,252 --> 00:48:01,294
<i>But if you're willing to start with that...</i>

709
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,585
<i>...then I'm more than willing to
meet you halfway and say, yes...</i>

710
00:48:04,752 --> 00:48:08,210
...this situation sucks.
This case sucks. U/North sucks.

711
00:48:08,377 --> 00:48:10,960
We can start with that.
All right, Arthur? You hear me?

712
00:48:11,169 --> 00:48:12,794
You're right about what we are.

713
00:48:13,502 --> 00:48:16,960
<i>I'm saying you're crazy. I'm saying
that your behavior is out of control.</i>

714
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:18,710
<i>But I'm telling you you're right.</i>

715
00:48:18,877 --> 00:48:22,335
You called it. We're janitors, I get it.

716
00:48:24,294 --> 00:48:26,210
But we came to this, Arthur.

717
00:48:27,169 --> 00:48:30,210
<i>We made decisions.
It didn't happen overnight.</i>

718
00:48:30,377 --> 00:48:34,460
You can't just suddenly stop and say,
"That's it, game over. I'm into miracles."

719
00:48:35,419 --> 00:48:37,210
<i>Arthur. Come on.</i>

720
00:48:38,877 --> 00:48:40,960
Goddamn it, pick up the phone and talk to me.

721
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:43,502
Because whatever else you think is so important...

722
00:48:43,669 --> 00:48:46,377
...you better let me help you,
because I'm telling you...

723
00:48:46,544 --> 00:48:50,752
...janitor to janitor, I don't see
anybody else with a broom on the horizon.

724
00:48:50,919 --> 00:48:53,335
It's me, buddy. I'm the--

725
00:48:53,502 --> 00:48:57,502
<i>Mailbox is full.
Your message cannot be recorded.</i>

726
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,419
<i>- Hello?
- Hello. Is Anna there?</i>

727
00:50:00,585 --> 00:50:01,960
Hang on.

728
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,877
<i>Anna!</i>

729
00:50:08,877 --> 00:50:11,002
<i>Where is she? Anna!</i>

730
00:50:13,585 --> 00:50:15,294
<i>- Anna!
- Anna!</i>

731
00:50:16,252 --> 00:50:18,544
<i>Anna, you've got a phone call!</i>

732
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:23,294
<i>Where is she? Anna!</i>

733
00:50:34,669 --> 00:50:35,752
Hello?

734
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:38,335
Anna, hi. It's Arthur.

735
00:50:38,544 --> 00:50:41,085
<i>- Hey.
- Did you get some sleep?</i>

736
00:50:41,544 --> 00:50:43,085
<i>I guess.</i>

737
00:50:43,252 --> 00:50:45,210
<i>Did you think about what we said?</i>

738
00:50:45,377 --> 00:50:48,002
<i>- Yeah.
- You didn't tell anybody, did you?</i>

739
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:52,710
No. My sister's spying on me,
but that's normal.

740
00:50:52,877 --> 00:50:55,585
Yeah. Because I meant what I said.

741
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:58,169
<i>I know. I know. It's just...</i>

742
00:50:59,294 --> 00:51:03,085
...there's, like, 450 people in this lawsuit.

743
00:51:03,919 --> 00:51:06,044
Why are you choosing me?

744
00:51:07,377 --> 00:51:09,710
I don't know. I'm crazy, right?

745
00:51:09,877 --> 00:51:11,460
<i>That's for sure.</i>

746
00:51:11,627 --> 00:51:13,585
I mean, does it--?
Does it really matter?

747
00:51:13,752 --> 00:51:17,919
<i>I mean, isn't it what we wait for?
To meet someone? And they're--</i>

748
00:51:18,085 --> 00:51:19,377
<i>They're like a lens...</i>

749
00:51:19,544 --> 00:51:23,210
...and suddenly you're looking
through them and everything changes...

750
00:51:23,377 --> 00:51:25,377
...and nothing can ever be
the same again.

751
00:51:25,544 --> 00:51:27,210
<i>Who you talking to?</i>

752
00:51:27,377 --> 00:51:30,127
It's for me, okay? I get calls too.

753
00:51:30,294 --> 00:51:31,710
That guy?

754
00:51:31,877 --> 00:51:35,377
Same guy. Same guy.

755
00:51:36,044 --> 00:51:37,377
Sorry.

756
00:51:38,419 --> 00:51:42,710
No. That's-- That's okay.
My mother used to listen to my calls.

757
00:51:42,877 --> 00:51:45,585
<i>She can't believe I can do anything on my own.</i>

758
00:51:45,752 --> 00:51:47,210
Well, that'll change.

759
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,252
<i>I guess.</i>

760
00:51:49,419 --> 00:51:52,460
<i>Yeah, but, see, that's something we can show her.</i>

761
00:51:52,627 --> 00:51:55,752
<i>That you can do something.</i>

762
00:51:55,919 --> 00:51:59,044
<i>That we could-- We could do that together
if you want. I mean....</i>

763
00:51:59,252 --> 00:52:01,502
<i>I mean that I can help you do that.</i>

764
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:05,044
I can get you 12 by Monday.

765
00:52:05,252 --> 00:52:07,294
Twelve's weak. Twelve looks bad.

766
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:08,919
How do you figure that?

767
00:52:09,085 --> 00:52:12,669
They look at 75 and they look at you
and they wonder what the problem is.

768
00:52:12,835 --> 00:52:14,919
You say 12.
That's gonna make people nervous.

769
00:52:15,085 --> 00:52:18,044
This was the day before yesterday.
Let me get my ducks in order.

770
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:19,419
What's the car worth?

771
00:52:19,585 --> 00:52:21,794
It's a lease. It's the firm's.

772
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,877
So? You go to the bank.
You've got the apartment. You refinance.

773
00:52:26,044 --> 00:52:28,669
I can't. I did that three months ago.

774
00:52:29,585 --> 00:52:31,294
Are you back at the tables?

775
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:34,377
Like I need that kind of action.
I don't have enough going on.

776
00:52:37,585 --> 00:52:39,585
I hope you're kidding.

777
00:52:39,752 --> 00:52:43,835
If he finds out you're playing cards with
his money, there's no dialogue after that.

778
00:52:45,419 --> 00:52:47,419
Do everyone a favor.

779
00:52:47,627 --> 00:52:52,044
Get out the treasure map and start digging.

780
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,294
You got a week.

781
00:52:55,627 --> 00:52:58,419
- Hey, Michael. How are you?
- Hi, Cindy. I'm good.

782
00:52:58,585 --> 00:53:01,877
Come in. He's been on the phone
all morning. What else is new?

783
00:53:02,085 --> 00:53:04,085
I am trying to get him out in 15 minutes.

784
00:53:04,252 --> 00:53:06,710
- Is he upstairs?
- He's taken over the living room.

785
00:53:06,877 --> 00:53:08,752
What are you guys doing?
Get down here.

786
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:13,710
Soroyo, I told you to keep an eye on
these kids, make sure they're downstairs.

787
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:29,710
Marty?

788
00:53:31,919 --> 00:53:34,794
You know what he's doing?
He's making their case.

789
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:38,335
I'm going through his files here, I'm reading this...

790
00:53:38,502 --> 00:53:40,377
...he's building a case against U/North.

791
00:53:40,544 --> 00:53:42,544
- Nobody's gonna let him do that.
- Let him?

792
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:44,085
Who the hell's gonna stop him?

793
00:53:44,627 --> 00:53:47,294
You know what I just heard?
He's calling these plaintiffs.

794
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:51,669
This woman from the deposition,
he's calling these people now.

795
00:53:51,835 --> 00:53:54,752
He's got these discovery documents.
This is a fucking nightmare.

796
00:53:54,919 --> 00:53:58,502
I tried him. Can't even leave a message.
He's got the machine jammed up.

797
00:53:58,669 --> 00:54:01,210
- Is that his briefcase?
- Yeah.

798
00:54:01,752 --> 00:54:03,585
- Why?
- We've been looking for it.

799
00:54:03,752 --> 00:54:07,252
I don't know. It came up here
with all the other stuff from his office.

800
00:54:07,419 --> 00:54:11,169
You can't believe the crap he's got in here.

801
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:13,210
Listen, Marty...

802
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,544
...I'm in a bind here.

803
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:21,419
I need a loan. I need 80 grand.

804
00:54:22,585 --> 00:54:24,919
- I thought you were done with that.
- It's not that.

805
00:54:25,085 --> 00:54:27,919
It's not the cards. It's none of that.
It's the restaurant.

806
00:54:28,085 --> 00:54:29,710
Eighty thousand.

807
00:54:29,877 --> 00:54:31,335
I'm sorry to jump you like this.

808
00:54:31,502 --> 00:54:34,252
I've been trying to get a meeting with you for two weeks.

809
00:54:35,044 --> 00:54:38,335
And I know about the merger,
whether I'm supposed to or not.

810
00:54:38,752 --> 00:54:40,419
There's nothing final on the merger.

811
00:54:40,585 --> 00:54:43,544
Well, that's why I'm asking you now.
You're my meal ticket.

812
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:46,377
Once you're out, it's me and Barry with strangers...

813
00:54:46,544 --> 00:54:48,419
...and I'm trying to explain what I do.

814
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:51,669
Everybody knows how valuable you are.
Everybody who needs to know.

815
00:54:51,835 --> 00:54:53,502
I'm 45 years old and I'm broke.

816
00:54:53,669 --> 00:54:56,377
I've been riding shotgun for 12 years and I got no equity.

817
00:54:56,544 --> 00:54:58,127
I'm sorry, I don't feel reassured.

818
00:54:58,294 --> 00:55:00,335
Nobody told you to go into the bar business.

819
00:55:00,502 --> 00:55:03,044
I only opened it so I'd have something else, a way out.

820
00:55:03,252 --> 00:55:04,919
I had no idea you were so unhappy.

821
00:55:05,085 --> 00:55:08,085
How many times did I ask you
to put me back on a litigation team?

822
00:55:08,252 --> 00:55:09,919
- How many?
- Anybody can go to court.

823
00:55:10,127 --> 00:55:11,335
You think that's special?

824
00:55:11,502 --> 00:55:14,169
- I was good at it.
- Wonderful. So are a lot of people.

825
00:55:14,627 --> 00:55:18,002
At this, what you do, you're great.

826
00:55:18,169 --> 00:55:22,419
For chrissakes, you got something
everybody wants. You have a niche.

827
00:55:22,627 --> 00:55:25,585
You made a place.
You made a niche for yourself.

828
00:55:25,794 --> 00:55:29,835
And if it's nostalgia-- "You should've seen
me when I was a DA back in Queens."

829
00:55:30,002 --> 00:55:33,419
--let me give you a serious piece of advice:
Leave it there.

830
00:55:33,585 --> 00:55:37,544
God forbid you're not as good as
you remember. I've seen that happen too.

831
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,960
But I didn't come here for advice, did I?

832
00:55:41,544 --> 00:55:44,835
So this is what? I give you the loan
or you don't help out with Arthur?

833
00:55:45,002 --> 00:55:46,585
- I never said that.
- No?

834
00:55:46,794 --> 00:55:48,085
Maybe you should have.

835
00:55:48,294 --> 00:55:52,919
I don't know how you're gonna take care
of this, but this, this is cancer.

836
00:55:53,127 --> 00:55:56,252
This is something, we don't get it
reined in and cleaned up soon...

837
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:58,585
...everything's vulnerable. Everything.

838
00:55:59,377 --> 00:56:02,710
- What are you telling me?
- That I'm counting on you.

839
00:56:03,085 --> 00:56:07,044
I'm telling you that by this time next week,
Arthur will be under control...

840
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:10,752
...and everybody who needs to will have
been reminded of your infinite value.

841
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,252
Jesus, Marty.

842
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:13,919
Hey.

843
00:56:14,085 --> 00:56:16,085
When did you get so fucking delicate?

844
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:18,752
I'm late.

845
00:56:58,377 --> 00:57:01,419
Why don't you just call Uncle Gene
and get the cops to help you?

846
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:03,627
It's not that kind of a problem.

847
00:57:05,294 --> 00:57:07,669
- How much longer are we doing this?
- I don't know.

848
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:23,460
If he comes back to get his car,
you call that number and let me know.

849
00:57:23,627 --> 00:57:26,752
- Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
- Okay. You're welcome.

850
00:57:34,127 --> 00:57:37,127
If we're not gonna get to the movie,
why don't you just say so?

851
00:57:37,294 --> 00:57:40,085
- What?
- I wanna go home.

852
00:57:40,252 --> 00:57:42,044
Come on, Henry.

853
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,419
Hold up!

854
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,335
Stay in the car. Lock the door.

855
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,960
Arthur! Arthur!

856
00:57:56,127 --> 00:57:57,460
Wait up.

857
00:57:58,294 --> 00:58:01,669
Michael. Jeez. You scared me.

858
00:58:03,085 --> 00:58:05,794
- Making a delivery?
- No, no, no.

859
00:58:06,669 --> 00:58:09,294
Very funny. No, nothing like that.

860
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:13,044
Here, take one, please. Really.
It's-- It's still warm.

861
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:14,835
It's the best bread I ever tasted.

862
00:58:18,877 --> 00:58:20,627
So welcome home.

863
00:58:21,794 --> 00:58:24,710
I know, the hotel. I'm sorry.

864
00:58:24,877 --> 00:58:27,252
I was beginning to feel a little overwhelmed.

865
00:58:27,419 --> 00:58:29,252
- But you're feeling better now?
- Yeah.

866
00:58:29,419 --> 00:58:31,919
- Much better, definitely.
- Not enough to call me back.

867
00:58:32,085 --> 00:58:35,294
Well, I was trying to gather my thoughts...

868
00:58:35,502 --> 00:58:39,085
...before I called you,
and that's what I was doing.

869
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:41,127
And how's that going?

870
00:58:41,294 --> 00:58:43,752
Yes, it's good, very good. I just....

871
00:58:44,044 --> 00:58:49,460
Well, I just need to make my thoughts
a little bit more precise. That's....

872
00:58:49,627 --> 00:58:50,919
That's my goal.

873
00:58:51,085 --> 00:58:54,460
As good as this feels, you know where it goes.

874
00:58:54,627 --> 00:58:56,002
No. No. You're wrong.

875
00:58:56,169 --> 00:58:59,294
What makes this feel good
is that I don't know where it goes.

876
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:03,627
How do I talk to you, Arthur?
So you hear me?

877
00:59:03,794 --> 00:59:08,294
Like a child? Like a nut?
Like everything's fine?

878
00:59:08,502 --> 00:59:12,252
What's the secret?
Because I need you to hear me.

879
00:59:12,419 --> 00:59:15,169
- Well, I hear everything.
- Then hear this.

880
00:59:15,627 --> 00:59:19,585
You need help.
Before this goes too far, you need help.

881
00:59:19,752 --> 00:59:20,960
You got great cards here.

882
00:59:21,169 --> 00:59:24,460
If you keep your clothes on, you can
do any goddamn thing you want.

883
00:59:24,669 --> 00:59:27,877
You want out, you're out.
You wanna bake bread, go with God.

884
00:59:28,044 --> 00:59:30,752
There's only one wrong answer
in this whole goddamn pile...

885
00:59:30,919 --> 00:59:32,669
...and you've got
your arms around it.

886
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:36,127
- Well, I said I was sorry.
- You thought the hotel was overwhelming?

887
00:59:36,335 --> 00:59:38,877
You piss on this case, they'll cut you off at the knees.

888
00:59:39,044 --> 00:59:42,294
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm covering for you.

889
00:59:42,502 --> 00:59:45,960
I'm telling them everything's fine.
You're fine. Everybody's cool.

890
00:59:46,169 --> 00:59:49,377
I'm out running this "price of genius" story
to anybody who'll listen.

891
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:53,794
And then I wake up this morning and I hear
you're calling this girl from Wisconsin...

892
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,835
...messing with documents
and whatever else.

893
00:59:56,002 --> 00:59:58,502
- How can you know that?
- They're gonna take everything.

894
00:59:58,669 --> 01:00:02,169
Your partnership, your equity.
They're gonna pull your license.

895
01:00:02,335 --> 01:00:04,502
- How do you know I called Anna?
- Marty told me.

896
01:00:04,669 --> 01:00:08,460
- Well, how does he know?
- I don't know. I don't give a shit!

897
01:00:12,169 --> 01:00:14,085
- You're tapping my phone.
- Jesus, Arthur.

898
01:00:14,252 --> 01:00:16,127
Then explain it.
Tell me how Marty knows!

899
01:00:16,294 --> 01:00:21,169
Because you're chasing a girl through
a parking lot with your dick hanging out.

900
01:00:21,335 --> 01:00:24,169
You think she didn't get off the phone
and dial her attorney?

901
01:00:24,335 --> 01:00:26,169
No. She wouldn't do that. I know that.

902
01:00:26,335 --> 01:00:29,335
Really? You think your judgment
is state-of-the-art right now?

903
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:35,127
They're putting everything on the table.
You need to stop and think this through.

904
01:00:35,294 --> 01:00:36,794
I'll help you think this through.

905
01:00:37,002 --> 01:00:39,210
I'll find somebody to help you think it through.

906
01:00:39,877 --> 01:00:43,544
Don't do this.
You're making it easy for them.

907
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:48,377
Michael, I have great affection for you.

908
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:52,835
You lead a very rich and interesting life,
but you're a bagman, not an attorney.

909
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,294
If you wanted to have me committed...

910
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:59,335
...you should have kept me in Wisconsin,
where the arrest report, the videotape...

911
01:00:59,502 --> 01:01:02,169
...and eyewitness accounts
of my inappropriate behavior...

912
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:04,294
...would have had
jurisdictional relevance.

913
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,835
I have no criminal record in the state of New York.

914
01:01:07,294 --> 01:01:12,544
And the single determining criterion
for involuntary incarceration is danger.

915
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:16,085
Is the defendant a danger to himself or others?

916
01:01:16,252 --> 01:01:18,960
You think you got the horses for that?

917
01:01:19,127 --> 01:01:21,835
Well, good luck and God bless.
But I tell you this:

918
01:01:23,127 --> 01:01:27,252
The last place you want to see me is in court.

919
01:01:28,085 --> 01:01:29,919
I'm not the enemy.

920
01:01:30,419 --> 01:01:32,460
Then who are you?

921
01:01:45,085 --> 01:01:47,002
<i>We find the seed.</i>

922
01:01:51,002 --> 01:01:53,085
<i>We shape the soil.</i>

923
01:01:56,002 --> 01:01:58,127
<i>We speed the harvest.</i>

924
01:02:00,294 --> 01:02:02,210
<i>We feed the planet.</i>

925
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,669
<i>We find the seed.</i>

926
01:02:19,794 --> 01:02:21,669
<i>We shape the soil.</i>

927
01:02:24,919 --> 01:02:26,877
<i>We speed the harvest.</i>

928
01:02:29,085 --> 01:02:30,335
<i>We feed the planet.</i>

929
01:02:48,585 --> 01:02:50,377
What the hell is he doing?

930
01:03:07,919 --> 01:03:09,669
<i>We find the seed.</i>

931
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:14,960
<i>You've reached the voicemail of
Arthur Edens at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.</i>

932
01:03:15,127 --> 01:03:17,002
<i>Please leave your message after the tone.</i>

933
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:18,960
Yes!

934
01:03:19,294 --> 01:03:23,169
Here we are, all together.
Is everyone listening?

935
01:03:23,335 --> 01:03:26,752
<i>This is the moment you've been waiting for.
A very special piece of paper.</i>

936
01:03:26,919 --> 01:03:30,460
<i>So let's have a big, paranoid,
malignant round of applause...</i>

937
01:03:30,627 --> 01:03:35,877
<i>...for United Northfield Culcitate
Internal Research Memorandum 229.</i>

938
01:03:36,044 --> 01:03:39,335
<i>June 19th, 1991.</i>

939
01:03:39,585 --> 01:03:41,210
"Conclusion:

940
01:03:41,377 --> 01:03:44,044
The unanticipated market growth for Culcitate...

941
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:49,460
...by small farms in colder climates
demands immediate cost-benefit analysis."

942
01:03:50,335 --> 01:03:53,294
<i>Would you guys like a little bit of legal advice?</i>

943
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:56,335
Never let a scientist use the words "unanticipated"...

944
01:03:56,502 --> 01:03:59,585
...and "immediate"
in the same sentence.

945
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:01,585
Okay? Okay.

946
01:04:01,752 --> 01:04:04,210
<i>"In-house field studies
have indicated...</i>

947
01:04:04,377 --> 01:04:09,085
<i>...that small short-season farms dependent
on well water for human consumption...</i>

948
01:04:09,252 --> 01:04:13,419
<i>...are at risk for toxic
particulate concentrations at levels...</i>

949
01:04:13,585 --> 01:04:17,502
..significant enough to cause
serious human tissue damage."

950
01:04:17,669 --> 01:04:20,044
Well, this is a long way of saying that...

951
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:23,544
...you don't even have to leave your house
to be killed by our product.

952
01:04:23,752 --> 01:04:25,794
We'll pipe it into your kitchen sink.

953
01:04:26,335 --> 01:04:29,085
<i>- " Culcitate's great market advantage...
- Give me the phone.</i>

954
01:04:29,252 --> 01:04:32,169
<i>...that it is tasteless, colorless
and does not precipitate...</i>

955
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:35,002
<i>...has the potential
to mask and intensify...</i>

956
01:04:35,169 --> 01:04:37,710
...these potentially lethal exposures."

957
01:04:37,919 --> 01:04:39,710
Now, I love this.

958
01:04:39,877 --> 01:04:41,752
Not only is this a great product...

959
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:45,627
...it is a superb cancer delivery system.

960
01:04:45,794 --> 01:04:48,544
"Chemical modifications of the Culcitate product...

961
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:52,877
<i>...the addition of a detector molecule,
such as an odorant or colorant...</i>

962
01:04:53,085 --> 01:04:57,919
<i>...would require a top-down redesign
of the Culcitate manufacturing process.</i>

963
01:04:58,169 --> 01:05:01,210
<i>These costs, while assumed to be significant...</i>

964
01:05:01,377 --> 01:05:03,169
<i>...were not summarized here. "</i>

965
01:05:03,335 --> 01:05:05,252
Which, loosely translated, means:

966
01:05:05,419 --> 01:05:09,502
"It's going to cost a fortune to go back
on this, and I'm just an asshole in a lab...

967
01:05:09,669 --> 01:05:12,794
...so could someone else
please make the decision?"

968
01:05:13,085 --> 01:05:16,669
<i>" Clearly, the release of
these internal research documents...</i>

969
01:05:16,835 --> 01:05:19,544
<i>...would compromise
the effective marketing of Culcitate...</i>

970
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:23,377
...and must be kept within
the protective confines...

971
01:05:23,585 --> 01:05:26,669
...of United-Northfield's
trade secret language."

972
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:32,544
<i>You don't need me to tell you what that means.</i>

973
01:05:32,835 --> 01:05:34,127
<i>Goodbye.</i>

974
01:05:37,835 --> 01:05:40,377
- It seemed to warrant my coming to--
- Yes.

975
01:05:42,169 --> 01:05:43,794
You have to contain this.

976
01:05:45,544 --> 01:05:47,752
- Contain?
- Right.

977
01:05:48,294 --> 01:05:50,377
Well, that's my question.

978
01:05:51,127 --> 01:05:55,460
What are the...?
What's the option that we're looking at?

979
01:05:55,627 --> 01:05:57,460
Along those lines.

980
01:05:57,627 --> 01:06:00,669
You're talking about the paper, the data?
I don't....

981
01:06:01,585 --> 01:06:06,002
Well, I'm wondering if there is some other option.

982
01:06:06,169 --> 01:06:08,044
I mean something I'm not thinking of?

983
01:06:08,752 --> 01:06:10,752
We deal in absolutes.

984
01:06:10,919 --> 01:06:13,794
Okay. I understand that. I do.

985
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:19,419
The material, the papers, I'm not a lawyer.
We try, we do what we can.

986
01:06:19,585 --> 01:06:21,419
Well, the other way?

987
01:06:23,419 --> 01:06:25,294
Is the other way.

988
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:31,710
- Maybe you wanna bring Don in on this.
- No.

989
01:06:31,877 --> 01:06:35,377
This is nothing to do with Don. He's busy.
This is nothing to do with Don.

990
01:06:42,294 --> 01:06:44,085
Do you think it's doable?

991
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:48,835
Yeah. We have some good ideas.
You say move, we move.

992
01:06:49,002 --> 01:06:52,085
If the ideas don't look so good, we back off, reassess....

993
01:06:52,252 --> 01:06:53,585
Okay.

994
01:06:57,627 --> 01:07:01,127
Is that, "Okay, you understand," or "Okay, proceed"?

995
01:07:04,877 --> 01:07:07,669
Are you 1? Are you 2? Are you 3?

996
01:07:07,835 --> 01:07:10,960
Are you 4? Are you 5? Are you 6?

997
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:13,335
- Are you 7? Are you 8? Are you 9?
- Come on.

998
01:07:13,502 --> 01:07:15,919
Come, come on. Come on, I said. Hey!

999
01:07:16,794 --> 01:07:18,669
Come on.

1000
01:07:18,835 --> 01:07:20,502
Go on, Dad, make a wish.

1001
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:22,585
If I get what I wish for, it'll kill me.

1002
01:07:23,419 --> 01:07:26,085
You're a maniac. Unbelievable.

1003
01:07:26,252 --> 01:07:28,169
Give me a hand, Eddie, huh?

1004
01:07:30,627 --> 01:07:32,460
All right, Eddie.

1005
01:07:32,627 --> 01:07:35,919
Now, I did not make this myself
and I don't wanna hear any complaints.

1006
01:07:36,127 --> 01:07:37,544
Happy birthday.

1007
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:39,460
You have time for cake?

1008
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,252
Yeah, yeah. I'll take one to go.

1009
01:07:42,419 --> 01:07:43,377
You going in?

1010
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:47,294
- I'm late already.
- Shit.

1011
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:48,877
You're not both running out?

1012
01:07:49,044 --> 01:07:50,794
I got a situation.

1013
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,627
- You can't hang?
- You're going in.

1014
01:07:52,794 --> 01:07:55,169
- Yeah. I got a shift.
- So do I.

1015
01:07:55,335 --> 01:07:58,294
Come on, man.
You haven't been up here in months.

1016
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:01,419
If you go back now, Mickey, Henry's staying here.

1017
01:08:01,585 --> 01:08:03,919
Good. You can drive him home.

1018
01:08:04,127 --> 01:08:05,544
Just stay for an hour.

1019
01:08:06,127 --> 01:08:07,919
The girls did all this stuff.

1020
01:08:08,794 --> 01:08:10,210
He'll be asleep by then.

1021
01:08:14,085 --> 01:08:16,169
Timmy's been calling me.

1022
01:08:20,127 --> 01:08:21,669
He's afraid to talk to you.

1023
01:08:21,835 --> 01:08:22,960
He should be.

1024
01:08:23,127 --> 01:08:25,752
- It closed out bad, right?
- Is that what he told you?

1025
01:08:25,919 --> 01:08:27,877
The kids are freaking out.

1026
01:08:28,252 --> 01:08:29,585
The in-laws are freaking out.

1027
01:08:30,585 --> 01:08:33,585
Pammy can't stop crying long enough to start freaking out.

1028
01:08:33,794 --> 01:08:37,419
- She took him back.
- So what? Fuck her and the kids?

1029
01:08:37,627 --> 01:08:40,252
No. Fuck Timmy.
And nothing's closed, okay?

1030
01:08:40,419 --> 01:08:44,085
I sold everything and we're still short.
So don't talk about Pammy and the kids.

1031
01:08:44,294 --> 01:08:45,335
I got my hands full.

1032
01:08:45,794 --> 01:08:49,210
If it was you, he'd be in traction.

1033
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,502
Yeah, he's sick, all right?

1034
01:08:53,669 --> 01:08:56,919
- He's sick. It's a sickness.
- There's a fresh perspective.

1035
01:08:57,085 --> 01:09:01,335
I've seen a lot of people falling off
the wagon lately. It's going around.

1036
01:09:02,419 --> 01:09:04,085
Is that pointed at me?

1037
01:09:06,419 --> 01:09:09,127
When do I see you?
How do I know what you're up to?

1038
01:09:09,294 --> 01:09:11,669
I haven't bet on a game in over a year.

1039
01:09:11,835 --> 01:09:14,335
I haven't been in a card room in 10 months.

1040
01:09:14,502 --> 01:09:17,585
I gambled on the bar.
I bet on Timmy and he wiped me out.

1041
01:09:17,752 --> 01:09:19,294
That was my big play, all right?

1042
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:23,294
I put up my walk-away money
and it's gone and I'm scrambling.

1043
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:26,085
Okay. Okay.

1044
01:09:27,127 --> 01:09:29,085
Cool down. I hear you.

1045
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,044
I'd be pissed off too.

1046
01:09:42,294 --> 01:09:43,919
Just hang for an hour.

1047
01:09:44,835 --> 01:09:46,919
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1048
01:10:21,169 --> 01:10:23,585
Ready? And, lift.

1049
01:10:23,752 --> 01:10:26,085
Ready and go.

1050
01:10:50,002 --> 01:10:51,085
Wipe.

1051
01:11:00,252 --> 01:11:02,127
You better hit it.

1052
01:11:35,669 --> 01:11:37,044
We're good.

1053
01:12:11,335 --> 01:12:14,460
Okay, I found it. That's his number.

1054
01:12:14,669 --> 01:12:16,669
Dr. Mullien.
See if you have any more luck.

1055
01:12:16,835 --> 01:12:18,794
If I can. As soon as I get a chance.

1056
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,044
It's Medicaid. They're running us in circles.
I can pull the file--

1057
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:24,085
Let him go, Steph. He's got a date.

1058
01:12:24,252 --> 01:12:26,502
I've got a date with a maniac attorney.

1059
01:12:26,669 --> 01:12:29,294
- Take a night off, Mickey.
- You look tired.

1060
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:31,460
- I'm okay. See you soon.
- Be good.

1061
01:12:31,627 --> 01:12:33,835
- All right. Bye.
- Bye, Hen.

1062
01:12:34,002 --> 01:12:35,710
- Bye, Pop.
- Bye.

1063
01:12:45,752 --> 01:12:48,127
- Uncle Timmy, hey!
- How you doing, Henry?

1064
01:12:48,294 --> 01:12:49,627
Henry, get in the car.

1065
01:12:52,294 --> 01:12:53,710
Good to see you, Hen.

1066
01:12:55,627 --> 01:12:58,377
- What do you want?
- I've been sober eight days now.

1067
01:12:59,377 --> 01:13:03,044
Been back at the meetings.
I wanted you to know.

1068
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:04,835
In front of the kid?

1069
01:13:05,002 --> 01:13:08,502
Mickey, please.
I know how bad I did, I swear.

1070
01:13:09,502 --> 01:13:13,127
I don't know how to make it right again.
It's all I think about.

1071
01:13:13,627 --> 01:13:15,919
What do I do? I don't know what to do.

1072
01:13:17,002 --> 01:13:19,544
Get Stephanie her tires back.

1073
01:13:24,835 --> 01:13:27,794
- Is he crying?
- I don't know.

1074
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,794
Because of drugs, right?

1075
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:31,752
That and everything else.

1076
01:14:03,085 --> 01:14:04,544
What?

1077
01:14:06,835 --> 01:14:08,169
Your Uncle Timmy...

1078
01:14:08,835 --> 01:14:14,335
...and I mean this, on his best day,
is never as tough as you.

1079
01:14:15,377 --> 01:14:18,544
I'm not talking about crying or the drugs or anything.

1080
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:21,794
I'm talking about in his heart, in his heart.
You understand me?

1081
01:14:22,877 --> 01:14:26,752
And all his charming bullshit,
this Big Tim, Uncle, Boss bullshit...

1082
01:14:26,919 --> 01:14:29,127
...and I know you love him,
and I know why.

1083
01:14:29,294 --> 01:14:31,085
But when you see him like that...

1084
01:14:31,252 --> 01:14:34,002
...you don't have to worry.
That's not how it'll be for you.

1085
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:36,752
You're not gonna be someone that goes through life...

1086
01:14:36,919 --> 01:14:40,502
...wondering why shit keeps
falling out of the sky around them.

1087
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:43,085
I know that. I know it.

1088
01:14:43,252 --> 01:14:44,544
Okay?

1089
01:14:48,794 --> 01:14:52,960
I see it every time I look at you.
I see it right now.

1090
01:14:55,252 --> 01:14:58,002
I don't know where you got it from, but you got it.

1091
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:01,002
Okay?

1092
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:15,502
Hello?

1093
01:15:25,544 --> 01:15:29,419
The neighbors came by.
They're renovating the loft downstairs.

1094
01:15:29,585 --> 01:15:34,210
They had water flooding from
his bathroom down to their place.

1095
01:15:34,544 --> 01:15:39,877
His front door, fire escape,
he had everything locked up pretty good.

1096
01:15:40,044 --> 01:15:44,335
It took our guys 10 minutes.
They had to knock the thing down.

1097
01:15:45,377 --> 01:15:48,294
There's pills all over the place.

1098
01:15:49,085 --> 01:15:54,169
Just the scene alone is pretty definitive for suicide.

1099
01:15:54,877 --> 01:15:57,252
Then I spoke to some of your partners...

1100
01:15:57,419 --> 01:16:01,002
...who ran down these problems
he'd been having lately, so....

1101
01:16:03,377 --> 01:16:06,502
- Is there a note?
- No. They looked.

1102
01:16:07,085 --> 01:16:11,669
It could be an accident or he was gonna
write a note and just messed up.

1103
01:16:12,710 --> 01:16:14,044
Can I get in there?

1104
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:17,210
His place? Not now. It's sealed.

1105
01:16:17,919 --> 01:16:22,085
Once the seal goes up, it's frozen.
We're gonna try and reach his daughter.

1106
01:16:22,252 --> 01:16:25,377
I guess she's off in Europe.
But she's gotta come in.

1107
01:16:26,044 --> 01:16:29,085
Or the M.E.'s gotta come back
with a toxicology report.

1108
01:16:29,252 --> 01:16:32,960
That's a couple of weeks at least
that it's gotta stay like that.

1109
01:16:33,377 --> 01:16:34,752
Sorry.

1110
01:16:36,794 --> 01:16:38,252
Sure.

1111
01:16:44,544 --> 01:16:45,502
Okay.

1112
01:16:49,752 --> 01:16:54,335
I know your brother a little.
My wife works the 190 out in Queens.

1113
01:16:56,002 --> 01:16:57,169
I'll tell him hello.

1114
01:16:57,335 --> 01:16:59,335
If something comes in, I'll get back to you.

1115
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:01,585
Yeah. I appreciate it.

1116
01:17:01,752 --> 01:17:03,544
I'm sorry for your loss.

1117
01:17:22,044 --> 01:17:24,627
- Michael.
- Jeff.

1118
01:17:24,794 --> 01:17:26,252
This is tough.

1119
01:17:26,419 --> 01:17:28,002
Yeah, it is. He in here?

1120
01:17:39,585 --> 01:17:41,752
Dumb son of a bitch.

1121
01:17:42,252 --> 01:17:43,377
What a thing.

1122
01:17:43,585 --> 01:17:45,794
- Hold on.
- I don't even know--

1123
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,877
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah. All right.

1124
01:17:48,044 --> 01:17:51,252
I didn't even get a chance to talk to him.

1125
01:17:51,419 --> 01:17:54,877
That crazy goddamn bastard.

1126
01:17:55,419 --> 01:17:58,419
What a waste.
What the hell was he thinking?

1127
01:17:59,085 --> 01:18:00,919
Marty? I gotta set this up.

1128
01:18:01,085 --> 01:18:02,627
Go. Go.

1129
01:18:03,377 --> 01:18:04,710
You okay?

1130
01:18:05,419 --> 01:18:07,210
Yeah, I'm fine.

1131
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,544
Come on, let's get you a drink.

1132
01:18:13,377 --> 01:18:17,585
I just keep replaying all this back.
Like, did I push him too hard?

1133
01:18:17,752 --> 01:18:19,002
Not a chance.

1134
01:18:19,169 --> 01:18:20,960
I just couldn't get through to him.

1135
01:18:21,127 --> 01:18:24,294
What, you scared him to death?
Come on. The man was a bull.

1136
01:18:24,752 --> 01:18:28,377
- Never happened.
- Why does he fold, then? Why does he...?

1137
01:18:30,419 --> 01:18:32,294
It's gotta be an accident.

1138
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:34,044
No, no. Arthur without a note?

1139
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:37,169
He couldn't piss without leaving a memo.
Has to be an accident.

1140
01:18:37,335 --> 01:18:39,585
I don't get that.
I don't understand that either.

1141
01:18:39,752 --> 01:18:42,002
One minute he's gonna take on the whole world...

1142
01:18:42,169 --> 01:18:45,210
...and then 12 hours later,
he's sucking down pills. Why?

1143
01:18:45,377 --> 01:18:46,752
Why?

1144
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:51,377
Because people are
fucking incomprehensible. "Why?"

1145
01:18:55,252 --> 01:18:58,710
Thirty years I know Arthur.

1146
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:00,877
Good years.

1147
01:19:02,419 --> 01:19:06,544
And what I feel right now, if I'm honest?

1148
01:19:09,419 --> 01:19:11,877
I can't even say, it's so awful.

1149
01:19:13,044 --> 01:19:14,710
You can say it.

1150
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:19,127
We caught a lucky break.

1151
01:19:22,127 --> 01:19:24,419
We did, didn't we?

1152
01:19:29,127 --> 01:19:32,585
Marty? We need to get up to the office.

1153
01:19:32,752 --> 01:19:34,460
- They accepted?
- In principle.

1154
01:19:34,627 --> 01:19:37,460
Don Jeffries wants us on the phone in half an hour.

1155
01:19:37,627 --> 01:19:40,544
I tried to explain about Arthur,
but they're short on sympathy.

1156
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:42,585
Wait a minute. U/North is settling?

1157
01:19:42,752 --> 01:19:46,835
They see a window. They wanna try.
It's their show. What are we gonna do?

1158
01:19:48,585 --> 01:19:51,710
You did what you could, Michael.
We all did.

1159
01:19:53,085 --> 01:19:54,419
It's....

1160
01:19:54,585 --> 01:19:56,252
It's what we got.

1161
01:19:57,419 --> 01:20:00,252
- You need a ride?
- No, thanks, I'm fine.

1162
01:20:33,002 --> 01:20:34,002
Hello.

1163
01:20:34,169 --> 01:20:36,752
Hello. Hi. I'm looking for Anna Kysersun.

1164
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,044
<i>Who is this?</i>

1165
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:41,710
Michael Clayton. I'm an attorney in
New York. I got your number from Arthur.

1166
01:20:41,877 --> 01:20:44,752
<i>- You have got some nerve.
- Excuse me?</i>

1167
01:20:44,919 --> 01:20:48,710
You get her all the way to New York City
and then leave her at the airport?

1168
01:20:49,127 --> 01:20:50,710
<i>This is not a complicated person.</i>

1169
01:20:50,877 --> 01:20:53,710
<i>This is a girl who's never been farther than Milwaukee.</i>

1170
01:20:53,877 --> 01:20:55,877
<i>- Wait a minute. Now, wait.
- No, you wait.</i>

1171
01:20:56,044 --> 01:21:00,252
She's coming home tomorrow
and when she does, if you call here again--

1172
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:02,752
Are you telling me she's in New York right now?

1173
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:05,210
<i>This is a young girl, do you hear me?</i>

1174
01:21:05,377 --> 01:21:07,794
She's in the city right now?

1175
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,544
<i>What kind of people are you?</i>

1176
01:21:09,710 --> 01:21:12,710
Listen. You just stay on the phone
one second. One second.

1177
01:21:45,419 --> 01:21:46,627
<i>Anna.</i>

1178
01:21:49,044 --> 01:21:50,544
Anna?

1179
01:21:51,335 --> 01:21:54,294
My name's Michael Clayton.
I'm a friend of Arthur's.

1180
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:57,127
I spoke with your sister.
She told me you were here.

1181
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:00,294
Please open the door, Anna.

1182
01:22:11,627 --> 01:22:13,294
What are you thinking?

1183
01:22:14,127 --> 01:22:19,419
I don't know. I'll watch the door.
You check his car. Let's get some details.

1184
01:22:22,252 --> 01:22:25,502
He didn't want to say exactly what it was.

1185
01:22:27,377 --> 01:22:31,210
Just that when I got here, he would pick me up...

1186
01:22:31,377 --> 01:22:33,752
...and show me, and I would see...

1187
01:22:34,710 --> 01:22:37,585
...that it was something
that would win the whole case.

1188
01:22:40,794 --> 01:22:42,627
Even this morning...

1189
01:22:42,794 --> 01:22:44,419
...I mean, I thought:

1190
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:50,585
"Okay, if I get to the airport
and the ticket's not there, then I'll know.

1191
01:22:50,794 --> 01:22:55,877
Okay, you're stupid,
and you can go home now."

1192
01:22:58,460 --> 01:23:03,294
But it was there and he paid, like, 800 dollars...

1193
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:06,127
...for a first-class ticket.

1194
01:23:06,294 --> 01:23:07,794
And I just....

1195
01:23:11,710 --> 01:23:13,627
I got on the plane.

1196
01:23:16,419 --> 01:23:18,335
I believed him.

1197
01:23:23,127 --> 01:23:27,794
You think maybe he was in some way disappointed?

1198
01:23:28,627 --> 01:23:32,585
Let's say that he knew that you
told somebody else about all of this...

1199
01:23:32,794 --> 01:23:36,210
...and, I don't know, in some crazy way,
he was disappointed by that?

1200
01:23:37,335 --> 01:23:40,210
- But I didn't.
- You must have told somebody else.

1201
01:23:40,377 --> 01:23:41,919
No.

1202
01:23:43,127 --> 01:23:45,294
He made me promise.

1203
01:23:46,794 --> 01:23:51,127
You didn't tell anybody else about this?
Not one other person?

1204
01:23:52,294 --> 01:23:53,669
No.

1205
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:01,377
He really was crazy, wasn't he?

1206
01:24:14,127 --> 01:24:16,960
- You talking about this?
- Let me see.

1207
01:24:18,502 --> 01:24:20,127
- You know what that is?
- Yeah.

1208
01:24:21,085 --> 01:24:24,127
You said a favor.
That's more than a favor.

1209
01:24:24,335 --> 01:24:26,460
Well, nobody's gonna know where it came from.

1210
01:24:27,835 --> 01:24:30,294
- Are you that jammed up?
- What are you talking about?

1211
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:33,085
Who asked for this?
It's the restaurant, right?

1212
01:24:33,252 --> 01:24:35,752
One of these guys you owe?
"Get me a seal."

1213
01:24:35,919 --> 01:24:37,544
You really wanna know?

1214
01:25:54,794 --> 01:25:57,002
This just gets better and better.

1215
01:25:58,669 --> 01:26:00,252
What are we doing?

1216
01:28:01,794 --> 01:28:02,835
Freeze!

1217
01:28:03,002 --> 01:28:05,710
Right there, asshole! Don't move!

1218
01:28:05,877 --> 01:28:08,169
- It's all right, I'm a friend!
- Get your hands up!

1219
01:28:08,335 --> 01:28:10,835
Get your hands up now! Now!

1220
01:28:11,044 --> 01:28:12,960
- What's in your hand?
- It's a book.

1221
01:28:13,127 --> 01:28:16,002
Drop it! Drop it, now! Drop it!

1222
01:28:16,169 --> 01:28:19,460
- Turn around. Slowly.
- All right. All right. Okay.

1223
01:28:19,627 --> 01:28:21,460
- Who else is here?
- Nobody.

1224
01:28:21,627 --> 01:28:24,044
- I said, who else is here?
- Nobody's here!

1225
01:28:24,210 --> 01:28:25,627
Check in there.

1226
01:28:26,419 --> 01:28:29,710
You move, I'll take your head off.

1227
01:28:59,544 --> 01:29:04,002
Now I owe this scumbag and his wife--
Who's a complete piece of shit in my unit.

1228
01:29:04,169 --> 01:29:06,252
- Now I owe them both my balls.
- I'm sorry.

1229
01:29:06,419 --> 01:29:08,419
- You know I am.
- "Nobody will know it's me."

1230
01:29:08,585 --> 01:29:11,669
You know what happens they don't
bury this, that I gave you this?

1231
01:29:11,835 --> 01:29:13,210
It's bad. I know it.

1232
01:29:13,377 --> 01:29:16,419
I'm 18 months away from my 20.
You just put my pension in jeopardy.

1233
01:29:16,585 --> 01:29:18,544
- You made your point.
- It's not a point!

1234
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:21,085
- Who called 911?
- What?

1235
01:29:21,377 --> 01:29:24,335
The building was empty. I was quiet.
I wasn't there very long.

1236
01:29:24,502 --> 01:29:26,919
Who called it in?
Does that make sense to you--?

1237
01:29:27,085 --> 01:29:28,669
This never happened.

1238
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:32,002
You got these cops thinking you're a lawyer.

1239
01:29:32,169 --> 01:29:34,210
You got these lawyers thinking you're a cop.

1240
01:29:34,377 --> 01:29:38,502
You got everybody fooled, don't you?
Everybody but you.

1241
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:40,794
You know exactly what you are.

1242
01:29:54,377 --> 01:29:55,919
We tried calling you six times.

1243
01:29:56,085 --> 01:29:58,210
But your machine must be busted or something.

1244
01:30:00,085 --> 01:30:01,544
We gave it our best shot.

1245
01:30:02,919 --> 01:30:05,377
We ran out of red covers.
We only had 2000 in stock...

1246
01:30:05,585 --> 01:30:07,419
...so we did the other thousand in blue.

1247
01:30:28,835 --> 01:30:30,335
Is everything all right?

1248
01:30:30,502 --> 01:30:31,710
It's fine, yeah.

1249
01:30:32,419 --> 01:30:35,502
You have a van or something?
Because I have 25 boxes back there--

1250
01:30:35,669 --> 01:30:38,710
Do me a favor. Hang on to them.

1251
01:30:38,919 --> 01:30:41,127
I'll come back and pick everything up next week.

1252
01:30:41,294 --> 01:30:43,377
- Seriously? Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

1253
01:31:03,919 --> 01:31:05,252
Hello.

1254
01:31:10,335 --> 01:31:13,627
Don. You go ahead. I'll catch up to you.

1255
01:31:14,210 --> 01:31:15,502
What?

1256
01:31:22,919 --> 01:31:25,044
<i>Do you know Michael Clayton?</i>

1257
01:31:25,252 --> 01:31:26,710
<i>Yeah, why?</i>

1258
01:31:26,919 --> 01:31:28,669
We have a situation.

1259
01:31:48,419 --> 01:31:50,002
Hey, did they find you?

1260
01:31:50,169 --> 01:31:53,210
- Who?
- Marty. I don't think they've gone in yet.

1261
01:32:01,377 --> 01:32:02,710
Marty.

1262
01:32:03,044 --> 01:32:06,210
Your phone's off. There's too much
going on for your phone to be off.

1263
01:32:06,419 --> 01:32:08,377
- I need a minute.
- Yeah, well, we're late--

1264
01:32:08,585 --> 01:32:10,210
We never got to finish last night.

1265
01:32:10,377 --> 01:32:12,502
Did you close the place?
You look like hell.

1266
01:32:12,669 --> 01:32:15,710
- No, I left right after you left.
- If you say so.

1267
01:32:15,919 --> 01:32:18,585
We've been here all night.
We had to make an announcement.

1268
01:32:18,752 --> 01:32:22,044
Jean! I need the thing, the envelope.

1269
01:32:22,210 --> 01:32:25,419
I wanted your input. I couldn't get you.
I had to pull the trigger.

1270
01:32:25,585 --> 01:32:28,502
I put Bob Nast and Kim, probably a mistake.

1271
01:32:28,669 --> 01:32:32,002
They're gonna pull together a memorial
service by the end of the week.

1272
01:32:32,169 --> 01:32:34,419
I told them to call you if they need any help.

1273
01:32:34,919 --> 01:32:37,710
No, no, no.
The other one. The other one.

1274
01:32:38,252 --> 01:32:40,585
So we cut you a check this morning.

1275
01:32:40,752 --> 01:32:44,044
There's some strings attached.
And Barry....

1276
01:32:44,210 --> 01:32:48,335
There's no way around this,
Barry's gonna have to be involved.

1277
01:32:52,085 --> 01:32:54,544
What if Arthur was on to something?

1278
01:32:54,710 --> 01:32:56,377
What do you mean? On to what?

1279
01:32:56,544 --> 01:32:59,419
U/North. What if he wasn't crazy?
What if he was right?

1280
01:32:59,585 --> 01:33:01,752
Right about what?
That we're on the wrong side?

1281
01:33:01,919 --> 01:33:04,335
Wrong side, wrong way, everything, all of it.

1282
01:33:04,502 --> 01:33:07,419
This is news?
This case reeked from day one.

1283
01:33:07,627 --> 01:33:09,585
I gotta tell you how we pay the rent?

1284
01:33:09,752 --> 01:33:12,502
What would they do?
What would they do if he went public?

1285
01:33:12,669 --> 01:33:16,085
What would they do? Are you fucking soft?
They're doing it.

1286
01:33:16,252 --> 01:33:18,669
We don't straighten the settlement out in 24 hours...

1287
01:33:18,835 --> 01:33:20,877
...they're gonna withhold
$9 million in fees.

1288
01:33:21,085 --> 01:33:24,044
Then they'll pull out the video of
Arthur doing his flashdance.

1289
01:33:24,210 --> 01:33:25,919
They'll sue us for legal malpractice.

1290
01:33:26,127 --> 01:33:29,752
Except there won't be anything to win
because the London merger will be dead...

1291
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:32,585
...and we'll be selling off
the goddamn furniture.

1292
01:33:33,085 --> 01:33:34,752
That's 80.

1293
01:33:35,294 --> 01:33:37,085
We're calling it a bonus.

1294
01:33:37,919 --> 01:33:39,919
Three-year contract
at your current numbers.

1295
01:33:40,127 --> 01:33:41,752
That's assuming this all works out.

1296
01:33:41,919 --> 01:33:43,085
You're doing this now?

1297
01:33:44,752 --> 01:33:48,085
Look, I agreed to this, okay?
But there's rules now.

1298
01:33:48,252 --> 01:33:51,127
You want the contract,
you sign a confidentiality agreement.

1299
01:33:51,294 --> 01:33:53,377
It's gonna be bulletproof and retroactive.

1300
01:33:53,544 --> 01:33:55,252
Because Marty's too nice to say it...

1301
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:59,252
...but with all you know about this place,
the clients and people who work here...

1302
01:33:59,419 --> 01:34:01,960
...it makes it a little weird
when you ask for 80 grand.

1303
01:34:02,627 --> 01:34:05,335
If I was gonna shake anybody down, I'd come to you...

1304
01:34:05,502 --> 01:34:08,169
...and it wouldn't be for 80 grand.
Is this him or you?

1305
01:34:08,335 --> 01:34:10,919
- If I'm wrong, I apologize.
- You're way the fuck wrong.

1306
01:34:11,127 --> 01:34:12,335
So there you go.

1307
01:34:12,502 --> 01:34:14,169
Enough. Okay? Everybody.

1308
01:34:15,044 --> 01:34:17,210
He's an asshole, but he knows it.

1309
01:34:17,627 --> 01:34:20,877
And you're on the record.
Okay? Everybody happy?

1310
01:34:21,502 --> 01:34:24,210
- Don Jeffries is here.
- We're on the way.

1311
01:34:25,002 --> 01:34:29,085
Call Bob Nast.
Just see if they need help with this thing.

1312
01:34:32,669 --> 01:34:34,044
You're welcome.

1313
01:35:26,877 --> 01:35:29,252
You said 12. This is 75.

1314
01:35:29,419 --> 01:35:31,585
Well, don't get too excited.
You want a drink?

1315
01:35:31,752 --> 01:35:33,627
No. I'm working.

1316
01:35:36,044 --> 01:35:39,585
So we're square, then. No bad blood.

1317
01:35:39,752 --> 01:35:41,460
You're just doing your job.

1318
01:35:41,627 --> 01:35:43,085
That's right.

1319
01:35:44,002 --> 01:35:45,752
Take it easy, Gabe.

1320
01:35:46,752 --> 01:35:48,127
Michael.

1321
01:35:59,835 --> 01:36:01,294
<i>Check.</i>

1322
01:36:03,127 --> 01:36:04,377
<i>Check.</i>

1323
01:36:04,710 --> 01:36:07,460
- Check.
- Half the pot. Two hundred.

1324
01:36:07,627 --> 01:36:08,919
Two hundred to go.

1325
01:36:46,252 --> 01:36:48,002
So, what happened with the bar?

1326
01:36:48,169 --> 01:36:50,210
You just had to be a rock star, huh?

1327
01:37:12,669 --> 01:37:15,460
What are you doing? You just got here.

1328
01:37:15,627 --> 01:37:17,544
Guy plays nine hands, walks away.

1329
01:37:17,710 --> 01:37:21,877
I scare you away? What did I do?
Did I scare you away?

1330
01:37:57,627 --> 01:37:58,669
Get out.

1331
01:38:00,044 --> 01:38:02,169
<i>Get out of the car now.</i>

1332
01:38:03,919 --> 01:38:04,919
<i>- Walter?
- Michael.</i>

1333
01:38:05,085 --> 01:38:07,294
<i>- Michael. Thank God you're there.
- Yeah.</i>

1334
01:38:11,669 --> 01:38:13,627
You have eight...

1335
01:38:14,502 --> 01:38:17,252
<i>...six, five...</i>

1336
01:38:17,419 --> 01:38:19,752
<i>...four, three....</i>

1337
01:38:19,919 --> 01:38:21,544
<i>Get out of the car.</i>

1338
01:38:25,002 --> 01:38:28,002
<i>- Tell him to stay off the phone.
- All right. But you're on it?</i>

1339
01:38:28,627 --> 01:38:30,044
Am I clean?

1340
01:38:30,210 --> 01:38:31,460
Just keep walking.

1341
01:38:31,627 --> 01:38:33,835
You copy. Am I clean?

1342
01:38:34,044 --> 01:38:37,044
Just keep moving.
He's walking to the car.

1343
01:38:37,585 --> 01:38:41,127
<i>- -to let him know you're on the way.
I'll get back to you with the details.</i>

1344
01:38:41,335 --> 01:38:43,752
<i>- Just give me two minutes.
- I'll be in the car.</i>

1345
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:50,877
<i>I didn't finish. It's in, but I don't know.</i>

1346
01:39:19,044 --> 01:39:22,585
It's loose. I got a pulse.
He's up there somewhere, but....

1347
01:39:24,377 --> 01:39:26,294
Let's find a way to boost the signal.

1348
01:39:33,877 --> 01:39:37,044
- I don't know what Walter promised you--
- A miracle worker!

1349
01:39:37,210 --> 01:39:40,460
That's Walter on the phone,
20 minutes ago. Direct quote, okay?

1350
01:39:40,627 --> 01:39:42,460
"I'm sending you a miracle worker."

1351
01:39:42,627 --> 01:39:44,294
- Well, he misspoke.
- About what?

1352
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:47,960
About the fact that you're the firm's fixer?
Or that you're any good at it?

1353
01:39:53,752 --> 01:39:55,710
We're up. Just got a signal.

1354
01:40:19,544 --> 01:40:21,877
There's nothing back this way.
What's he doing?

1355
01:40:22,044 --> 01:40:23,252
Maybe he's lost.

1356
01:40:23,419 --> 01:40:25,210
- Wait a minute.
- That's him.

1357
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:29,794
He was alone, right?

1358
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:32,752
- Yeah, I think so.
- Call it, yes or no?

1359
01:40:35,210 --> 01:40:36,835
We gotta turn around.

1360
01:41:07,044 --> 01:41:08,669
Talk to me.

1361
01:41:08,835 --> 01:41:10,377
It's strobing.

1362
01:41:10,544 --> 01:41:12,960
No, we're good. I think we're good.
Just keep going.

1363
01:41:28,752 --> 01:41:30,335
No, he turned. Somehow he turned.

1364
01:41:30,544 --> 01:41:31,877
- Where?
- He took--

1365
01:41:32,377 --> 01:41:34,377
- He took a left.
- I don't have a left.

1366
01:41:44,335 --> 01:41:47,252
- East. He's southeast.
- What, so we missed it?

1367
01:41:47,419 --> 01:41:49,544
- Or the grid is wrong.
- Hang on.

1368
01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:02,419
- We gotta go back to one.
- One is what? Where's our one?

1369
01:42:02,627 --> 01:42:05,627
Half a mile straight ahead.
Just keep driving. Just go.

1370
01:42:12,502 --> 01:42:15,127
It says we're closing.
But that's west. It can't be west.

1371
01:42:15,294 --> 01:42:16,335
The signal or the grid?

1372
01:42:16,544 --> 01:42:19,252
- It's both. It just keeps dropping out.
- Goddamn it.

1373
01:43:10,419 --> 01:43:11,919
Give me the cell.

1374
01:43:14,419 --> 01:43:16,127
Our signal's good.

1375
01:44:53,919 --> 01:44:55,210
What?

1376
01:44:57,835 --> 01:44:59,544
Thanks, Mickey.

1377
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:01,377
Just get me out of here.

1378
01:45:09,085 --> 01:45:12,794
I wanna get a meeting scheduled on this,
soon as we can. Thursday at the latest.

1379
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:16,585
I think we should have someone from
the equity group there. Maybe McDonnell--

1380
01:45:16,752 --> 01:45:18,252
- Yeah?
- Did you hear?

1381
01:45:18,419 --> 01:45:20,960
- Yeah, yeah. They closed U/North.
- No. Michael Clayton.

1382
01:45:21,419 --> 01:45:22,460
What?

1383
01:45:22,627 --> 01:45:25,544
Car bomb. Upstate. This morning.
He was killed.

1384
01:45:26,585 --> 01:45:27,585
What?

1385
01:45:29,294 --> 01:45:31,085
Holy shit.

1386
01:45:45,294 --> 01:45:50,210
<i>It has been and it remains the U/North position...</i>

1387
01:45:50,377 --> 01:45:54,460
<i>...that this lawsuit is baseless
and without merit.</i>

1388
01:45:54,627 --> 01:45:58,710
Our reluctance to negotiate was anchored by this belief...

1389
01:45:58,877 --> 01:46:04,044
...and reinforced by the plaintiffs' demand
for settlement...

1390
01:46:04,210 --> 01:46:06,752
...in excess of 3 billion dollars.

1391
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:10,377
The reason that we are all here today is...

1392
01:46:10,585 --> 01:46:14,419
...that several key elements
in the case have changed.

1393
01:46:15,460 --> 01:46:19,877
<i>You all have a tentative proposal packet...</i>

1394
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:24,419
<i>...which outlines the details,
but the bottom line is this:</i>

1395
01:46:24,627 --> 01:46:27,377
<i>Over the past several months we had gotten word...</i>

1396
01:46:27,544 --> 01:46:30,877
...that the plaintiffs were
growing impatient...

1397
01:46:31,044 --> 01:46:34,877
...and were in the process
of revising their settlement numbers.

1398
01:46:35,377 --> 01:46:36,835
<i>We also learned...</i>

1399
01:46:37,002 --> 01:46:40,960
<i>...that the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees
were capped at 32 percent...</i>

1400
01:46:41,127 --> 01:46:43,210
<i>...up to 400 million dollars...</i>

1401
01:46:43,627 --> 01:46:47,877
...above which,
their fees dropped to 24 percent.

1402
01:46:48,044 --> 01:46:52,585
So we knew that there would be
this motivational dead zone for them...

1403
01:46:52,794 --> 01:46:54,127
...in the middle there.

1404
01:46:54,877 --> 01:46:56,585
<i>Finally...</i>

1405
01:46:56,752 --> 01:47:01,085
...our finance team informed us
that they had run the numbers...

1406
01:47:01,252 --> 01:47:03,085
...and that the tax benefit...

1407
01:47:03,252 --> 01:47:06,460
...provided that we bring
the settlement in under 600 million...

1408
01:47:06,627 --> 01:47:09,085
...and within this fiscal year...

1409
01:47:09,252 --> 01:47:15,127
...that the write-off on this settlement
would essentially pay for itself.

1410
01:47:15,627 --> 01:47:19,794
<i>The package that you have before you
represents, in my judgment...</i>

1411
01:47:20,252 --> 01:47:25,044
<i>...the strongest possible position for
our company under the circumstances.</i>

1412
01:47:25,210 --> 01:47:26,919
<i>And, as chief counsel...</i>

1413
01:47:27,085 --> 01:47:30,335
...it is my recommendation
that this proposal be confirmed.

1414
01:47:31,419 --> 01:47:34,919
Thank you, Karen. If you just give us
a few minutes to talk about it.

1415
01:47:35,127 --> 01:47:37,377
Certainly. I'll be right outside.

1416
01:47:39,794 --> 01:47:40,752
Well....

1417
01:48:03,877 --> 01:48:05,710
How'd it go in there?

1418
01:48:08,752 --> 01:48:10,960
Pretty freaky, huh?

1419
01:48:11,127 --> 01:48:14,085
Did you see Arthur?
He's wandering around here somewhere.

1420
01:48:16,627 --> 01:48:19,877
I'm kidding. Lighten up.

1421
01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:25,127
You got one of these? It's a great memo.
It's an oldie but a goodie.

1422
01:48:28,294 --> 01:48:29,794
Got your heart racing, don't I?

1423
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:32,085
I don't know what it is you think you're doing.

1424
01:48:32,252 --> 01:48:33,627
What do you think I'm doing?

1425
01:48:33,794 --> 01:48:35,585
The suit's over. We have a deal.

1426
01:48:35,752 --> 01:48:38,460
Whatever that is, it's meaningless at this point.

1427
01:48:38,627 --> 01:48:42,294
You think? I must have gotten it wrong.
I thought you had a tentative proposal.

1428
01:48:42,460 --> 01:48:44,627
I didn't realize you'd signed all those checks.

1429
01:48:44,835 --> 01:48:48,127
That's a drag. I got a thousand of these.
What am I gonna do with them?

1430
01:48:48,294 --> 01:48:49,627
I'm calling Marty.

1431
01:48:49,794 --> 01:48:52,127
Good. Good. Do it.
That's a great place to start.

1432
01:48:52,335 --> 01:48:55,127
Let's find out who told him
Arthur was calling Anna Kysersun.

1433
01:48:55,294 --> 01:48:57,127
Let's find out who tapped those phones.

1434
01:48:57,294 --> 01:49:01,085
This memorandum, even if it's authentic,
which I doubt, I highly doubt--

1435
01:49:01,252 --> 01:49:04,669
- I know what you did to Arthur.
- It's protected. It belongs to U/North.

1436
01:49:04,835 --> 01:49:07,627
- I know you killed him.
- It's attorney-client privilege.

1437
01:49:07,794 --> 01:49:11,460
See, now, that's just not the way to go here, Karen.

1438
01:49:11,627 --> 01:49:14,294
For such a smart person, you really are lost, aren't you?

1439
01:49:14,502 --> 01:49:15,794
This conversation is over.

1440
01:49:16,002 --> 01:49:19,419
I'm not the guy that you kill.
I'm the guy that you buy.

1441
01:49:19,585 --> 01:49:22,127
Are you so fucking blind you don't even see what I am?

1442
01:49:22,294 --> 01:49:25,752
I'm the easiest part of your whole
goddamn problem and you're gonna kill me?

1443
01:49:26,085 --> 01:49:29,210
Don't you know who I am?
I'm a fixer. I'm a bagman.

1444
01:49:29,377 --> 01:49:32,794
I do everything from shoplifting housewives
to bent congressmen...

1445
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:34,835
...and you're gonna kill me?

1446
01:49:35,794 --> 01:49:38,627
What do you need, Karen? Lay it on me.

1447
01:49:38,794 --> 01:49:42,460
You want a carry permit? You want
a heads-up on an insider-trading subpoena?

1448
01:49:42,669 --> 01:49:46,502
I sold out Arthur for 80 grand
and a contract and you're gonna kill me?

1449
01:49:48,002 --> 01:49:49,419
What do you want?

1450
01:49:49,585 --> 01:49:51,127
What do I want?

1451
01:49:51,294 --> 01:49:52,877
I want more.

1452
01:49:53,377 --> 01:49:55,127
I want out.

1453
01:49:55,335 --> 01:49:57,960
And with this, I want everything.

1454
01:49:59,710 --> 01:50:00,960
Is there a number?

1455
01:50:01,127 --> 01:50:02,710
Ten is a number.

1456
01:50:02,877 --> 01:50:04,919
Ten? Ten what?

1457
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:08,460
Ten million?

1458
01:50:08,627 --> 01:50:12,044
Where do you think I'm gonna get 10 million dollars?

1459
01:50:12,627 --> 01:50:14,502
You know what's great about this?

1460
01:50:14,669 --> 01:50:17,002
Did you read it to the end?
You see who signed it?

1461
01:50:17,544 --> 01:50:19,460
Let's go in and ask Don Jeffries...

1462
01:50:19,627 --> 01:50:22,627
...if he wants to pass the hat
for a worthy cause.

1463
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:26,835
This would have to be a longer conversation...

1464
01:50:27,002 --> 01:50:29,127
...and would have to take place
somewhere else.

1465
01:50:29,335 --> 01:50:30,794
Where? My car?

1466
01:50:32,377 --> 01:50:33,419
All right.

1467
01:50:34,585 --> 01:50:37,627
I'm gonna make it easy.
Let's make it 5.

1468
01:50:37,794 --> 01:50:39,585
Five and I'll forget about Arthur.

1469
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:46,710
Five is easier. Yeah, 5 is something
that we could talk about.

1470
01:50:46,877 --> 01:50:50,627
Good. And then the other 5 is
to forget about the 468 people...

1471
01:50:50,794 --> 01:50:52,877
...that you knocked off
with your weed killer.

1472
