1
00:00:42,780 --> 00:01:14,150
I won't let anyone come
between us anymore...

2
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,220
Are they recording?

3
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,150
Help!

4
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,580
Cigarette?

5
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,090
Light?

6
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,850
I don't believe the dream I just had.

7
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,020
I was in a forest, running barefoot.

8
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,020
I was hurt, and I was being followed
by somebody, and, well...

9
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,310
the more I ran, the more
I could sense him coming closer.

10
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,570
Who was the guy stalking you?

11
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,690
It wasn't a guy. It was me.
That's the weirdest part.

12
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,320
It was me running after me.

13
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,610
Can't you have normal dreams
like everyone else?

14
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,240
No.

15
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,700
Being like everyone else
is an awful bore!

16
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,790
We should've stayed home
and not gone out last night.

17
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,710
I'm exhausted.

18
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,210
Take a rest.
I'll wake you when we get there.

19
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,130
- Yeah, very funny!
- I'll drive, if you like.

20
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,590
I'll drive, if you like.

21
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,760
Come on. It was late, and I felt tired.

22
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,470
Felt tired, huh?

23
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,720
You were dead drunk!

24
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,890
Well, it was your fault for dumping me
for three hours

25
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,680
and disappearing with God knows who!

26
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,430
I hope at least that he was worth it.

27
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,350
I'll say! Unbelievable!

28
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,770
- Bitch!
- Bastard!

29
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,980
Maneater!

30
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,030
- Bad lay!
- Anybody's!

31
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,280
Cheap hooker!

32
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,410
Are there any cool places to go
in the country?

33
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,870
Well, there's a town hall,
but that's about it.

34
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,160
If I had to live here all year round,
I think I'd shoot myself.

35
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,750
It's another kind of rhythm.

36
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,130
It's different.

37
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,500
Besides, we didn't come here
to go partying.

38
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,170
We're here to study. Remember?

39
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:17,260
- Hey, we're not deaf!
- Chill out Marie, will you!

40
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,140
C'mon Hendrix, run!

41
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,390
C'mon, faster Hendrix, faster!
Don't be so lazy.

42
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,360
C'mon... that's it.

43
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,360
- C'mon, faster! Hurry up, Hendrix!
- Tom...

44
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,940
stop shouting for a minute.

45
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:14,990
You're giving me a head ache!

46
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,320
How long do we have to wait for Alex?

47
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,620
She'll be here
after you've had your bath.

48
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,910
No, because Alex has never seen
this cowboy suit.

49
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,370
Tom, go and have your bath,

50
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,210
and then you can put your cowboy
suit back on again. Okay?

51
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,920
Come on, Hendrix...

52
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,510
Yeah, like that.

53
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,100
Go on, yeah. Keep going.

54
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,970
Yeah, faster. Don't stop!

55
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,930
Keep going!

56
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,900
Look at me! Look at me!

57
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,790
Marie, watch the road, will you!

58
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,790
You've still got some makeup on, y'know.

59
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,050
Are you sure it's this way?

60
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,260
Of course I'm sure. In fifty meters,
you go right at the corn field.

61
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,930
There it is. Turn right,
and then go straight for four kilometers.

62
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,930
You really have to know your way around.

63
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,100
Nobody takes this road except
for tractors.

64
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,650
Four kilometers of this,
and it's good-bye car.

65
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,950
No, we're both used to it.

66
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,820
You can't act that way
when ever a guy tries to talk to you.

67
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,830
- I don't act that way with everyone.
- Come off it, Marie.

68
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,040
It's always the same story,
and you know it.

69
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,370
- Stop!
- What's wrong?

70
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,790
I saw someone!

71
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,710
That's not funny, Alex!

72
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,960
No, I'm not kidding.
I saw someone. I swear.

73
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,340
Stop screwing around like that,
will you!

74
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,430
Alex, come back here, please!

75
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,190
Alex!

76
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,200
Damn it!

77
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,910
Alex!

78
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,750
Alex!

79
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,170
If this is a joke,
I'll make you regret it!

80
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,250
Alex, where are you?

81
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,840
Alex,

82
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,010
where are you?

83
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,600
I'll get you for this, damn it!

84
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,950
If you think you're being funny,
you've got another thing coming!

85
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:52,290
Alex! Stop, you bitch,

86
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,040
Alex!

87
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,960
Alex!

88
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,510
Come back bitch, right now!

89
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,010
Come back!

90
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,310
Come on!
I'm sick of your little game!

91
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,190
Enough is enough!

92
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,850
God damn you!

93
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,150
What if I had left you out here?

94
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,650
Yeah, very funny!

95
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,400
You scared the hell out of me!

96
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,530
Go on, laugh your head off!

97
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,530
- Very funny!
- Where's your sense of humor, Marie?

98
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,880
Here we are.

99
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,430
Okay, now I know why you passed
your exams so easily.

100
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,600
If you spend all your weekends up here,

101
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,270
there's not much
else to do except study!

102
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,650
Men det är lungt och skönt. Man kan
höra tågen som går förbi, det är det.

103
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,620
Easy Hendrix,

104
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,950
- How are you?
- Hello dad.

105
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,540
Don't worry. He doesn't bite.

106
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,290
You talking about me or the dog?

107
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,670
Marie, this is my father. Pop, Marie.

108
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,750
Nice to meet you.

109
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,420
So, I finally see you in person
and not just in a photo.

110
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,420
- Photo?
- You know, the one I took in Spain.

111
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,510
Yes, it's on the fireplace.

112
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,970
You're already part of the furniture.

113
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,090
And this is Tom. Hi cowboy.

114
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,430
- Are you happy to see me, pardner?
- That's all he's been talking about.

115
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,730
He insisted on staying up
and waiting for you.

116
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,940
And your mother's been worrying
all day, of course.

117
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,570
Mom always worries for nothing.

118
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,740
I think she left you something
in the oven.

119
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,740
But I told her we'd manage
and not to bother.

120
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,070
She didn't know if you'd have time
to eat on the way.

121
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,700
Oh, that's mom!

122
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,580
I'll put Tom Thumb to bed
and show Marie her room.

123
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,580
Right. I'll leave you then.

124
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,000
I have some work to finish.

125
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,920
- G'night. Sleep well.
- See you tomorrow.

126
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,710
- Good night, sir.
- Sweet dreams.

127
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,340
Did your dad build this place?

128
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,930
Not really. It was an old farm
that he renovated.

129
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,970
There are lots of them in the region.
Most of them are ruins.

130
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,510
It's a pity.

131
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,270
They've lived here for five years now.

132
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,270
Did they have problems
with the neighbours?

133
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,020
With the local yokels?

134
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,400
Well, at first, they took my folks
for a couple of hippies

135
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,440
who came to make goat cheese,
but now it's fine.

136
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,030
Well, that's my room. There.

137
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,990
This way now.

138
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,410
My parents' room's on the right.

139
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,910
Tom's room is there.

140
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,790
I'll put him to bed first.

141
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,680
There. You're all tucked in.

142
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,970
Mommy?

143
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,190
Alexis, is that you?

144
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,440
That's my mother.

145
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,190
Go on. I'll be right up.

146
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,530
Hi mom.

147
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,860
Is your friend all settled in?

148
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,660
Show her where the blankets are.

149
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,870
If she needs towels,
there are clean ones in the closet.

150
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,870
Don't worry.
She has everything she needs.

151
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,160
Good night, darling.

152
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,290
'Night mom.

153
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,720
Your own private bathroom.
Great, huh?

154
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,020
The heating is electric.
Should I turn it on?

155
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,100
No, I can do it if I get cold.

156
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,650
Well, what do you think?

157
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,860
It's like a doll's house... very pretty.

158
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,540
The problem is he's got a girl friend

159
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,920
he doesn't seem
to want to split up with.

160
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,580
Why are you so interested then?

161
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,960
Someone who's taken can't be
all that bad.

162
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,880
I'm always suspicious of guys
who are free.

163
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,800
Here.

164
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,680
- Want some more?
- No thanks.

165
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,970
Well, I think it's too easy to be
a womanizer

166
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,600
when you're already taken.

167
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
Well, you may be right. I don't know.

168
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,230
Maybe I'm just trying to convince myself.

169
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,810
Maybe he doesn't like me at all.

170
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,650
- What's his girlfriend like?
- She's Brazilian.

171
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,320
They've been together for three months.

172
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,820
What's he doing with a Brazilian woman?

173
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,900
What, is he into exoticism or something.

174
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,240
Anyway, I've gotta get a suntan fast

175
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,160
and firm up my ass a little too!

176
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,990
You should see the way she's built!

177
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,160
If you do salsa, I'll go with you.

178
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:31,380
Don't get them excited
or they'll keep us up all night chirping!

179
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,920
Hey, what about you?

180
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,170
When are you finally gonna
try your luck?

181
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,420
Don't start with that.

182
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,670
You're gonna end up an old maid, Marie.

183
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,130
I'm not hot enough to trot like you.

184
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,970
No, you're scared, that's all.

185
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,390
Well, I'm gonna have a smoke outside.

186
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,140
How about you?

187
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,220
No, I'm going to bed. I'm wiped out.

188
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,060
Don't stay up too late.

189
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,770
I'll wake you at nine, ok?

190
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,810
What's the game plan?

191
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,110
We'll start with international law.

192
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,480
- Okay?
- Okay.

193
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,070
- Good night Alex.
- Good night.

194
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,320
Hey Alex...

195
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,860
I'm glad that I finally met your family.

196
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,680
C'mon Hendrix.

197
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,020
Come on, come on, come on Hendrix.

198
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,810
That's it, come on.

199
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,630
G'night Hendrix.

200
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,460
Okay, I'm coming.

201
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,970
Who can that be?
Hendrix, quiet down.

202
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,590
Who is it?

203
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,770
What do you want?

204
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,710
What's the matter, mommy?

205
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,800
Nothing darling.
Go back to your room, dear.

206
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,050
But what was that noise?

207
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,550
Tom, do as I say right now.

208
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:25,300
Go on, go back to your room.

209
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,900
Daniel?

210
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,980
Daniel? ...Daniel?

211
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,490
Shit, it's the TV plug!

212
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,030
What am I?

213
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,410
What am I gonna do?

214
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:56,450
Why? Why? Why?

215
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,260
Alex...

216
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,180
Alex...

217
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:07,440
Alex...

218
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,790
Wait a second!

219
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,250
It won't come off!

220
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:28,290
Wait!

221
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,720
Wait!

222
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,130
Mommy!

223
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,470
Mommy!

224
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,220
Mommy!

225
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:49,060
Mommy! Mommy!

226
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:53,690
Mommy! Mommy!

227
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,570
Mommy!

228
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,660
Try to calm down, Alex.

229
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,530
If he wanted to kill you,
he'd have done it already. Right?

230
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,750
Now listen to me, Alex, listen.
Listen to me.

231
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:47,000
Listen to me Alex, for Christ's sake!

232
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,830
Tell me where I can find a telephone!

233
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,920
In the kitchen?

234
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,250
In the kitchen?

235
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,590
Answer me, Alex!

236
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,670
I can't do anything alone!

237
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,340
I need you!

238
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:02,430
I'll be back. I'll be back, Alex.
I'll be back.

239
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:06,730
I have to see
if someone is in the house.

240
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,670
I don't believe it!

241
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,500
The phone's been cut.

242
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,460
I'm gonna get you out of here!

243
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,840
You'll see... you'll see...

244
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:08,420
Not so loud! He'll hear us!

245
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:20,180
Don't ruin our only chance. Come on.

246
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,100
Alex...

247
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:37,830
we're gonna get out of this.
I promise you.

248
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:41,950
Even if we have to fight it out,
we're gonna make it!

249
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:56,890
The others were alone!
There are TWO of us!

250
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:48,850
It's gonna work! It's got to!

251
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:06,830
Just a little more...

252
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:09,880
Alex, I got it open!

253
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:47,000
We're in a gas station.

254
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,550
This could be our only chance.

255
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,180
The knife...

256
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,270
This is for if I don't come back.

257
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,590
- Miss, what is it?
- Call the police! It's an emergency!

258
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,720
What?

259
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,890
Miss, wait!

260
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,990
Hey Jimmy...

261
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:48,780
- How are ya?
- Fine.

262
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,830
All alone tonight?

263
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,460
Uh weekends are slow around here.

264
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,840
Yeah, I'm all alone.

265
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:02,970
So then, everyone took off
and left the shop to you, huh?

266
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:05,720
Yeah, that's about it.

267
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:14,850
This place isn't bad for bringing a girl
at night, huh Jimmy?

268
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,020
Don't tell me you never did it.

269
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:19,610
My boss wouldn't keep me on
for two minutes

270
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:22,570
if I brought someone here.

271
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:33,290
I'll bet you've got all kinds
of real fancy ladies stopping here

272
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:38,210
and I'll also bet they ask you
for a little service while they're here.

273
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:40,500
You get 'em all excited.

274
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:43,130
Ain't that right, Jimmy?

275
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:46,340
Well, yeah, I guess so.

276
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:57,440
What do ya think, Jimmy? Y'like 'em?

277
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:03,400
Well, they look real good on you.

278
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,070
- They protect you?
- From what?

279
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:08,410
From the sun, Jimmy... from the sun.

280
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:11,870
Yeah, well, they're sunglasses so

281
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:14,830
they protect your eyes, sure.

282
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,170
What do I owe ya?

283
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,960
Just for the gas,
that makes twenty eight.

284
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,510
- Y'want the glasses?
- No,

285
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:29,930
I'm not convinced,
but what I could use is some booze,

286
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:32,850
so how about selling me
a bottle of J and B?

287
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,340
- I'd rather have a bottle of Campbell's.
- Sure.

288
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:12,640
Actually, I'm not allowed
to sell alcohol at this hour.

289
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,100
You promise not to tell the boss?

290
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,270
I promise.

291
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,930
What were you lookin' at, huh Jimmy?

292
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:20,560
What were you lookin' at?

293
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:10,490
Oh, somebody answer for Christ's sakes!

294
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:13,750
Answer!

295
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:15,000
State Police here.

296
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:18,340
Hello? Hello, police?
Oh I beg of you, help me!

297
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:20,960
Okay, calm down and tell me
what the problem is.

298
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:23,050
The Sorals, they have a farm
near Puyanne.

299
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:25,220
I'm a friend of their daughter, Alexis.

300
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,430
This guy broke in during the night.

301
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:28,430
He broke in and he murdered everyone!

302
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:30,010
He took my friend away in a pickup truck,

303
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:31,680
and I'm really afraid for her.

304
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:33,180
He just killed the gas station guy.

305
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:34,350
- Gas station?
- Yes.

306
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,400
- You're in a gas station?
- Yes.

307
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,690
Which gas station?

308
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,700
Hold on. I'll have a look.

309
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:53,370
I don't know what station.
I was in his pickup truck.

310
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:55,660
All I know is it's a very old pickup,
brown, old and rusty.

311
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:58,130
Did you get the vehicle's plate number?

312
00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:00,340
How could I get the number?
I told you I was inside the truck!

313
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,300
Do you realize how many pickup trucks
there are on the road?

314
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:04,170
Without a plate number...

315
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,340
Jesus, an old pickup truck on a country
road at this time of night

316
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:08,140
shouldn't be that hard to spot, huh?!

317
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:10,300
Calm down please, ma'm,

318
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:11,850
and tell me where you are.

319
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:14,350
Listen, this son of a bitch
just took off with her.

320
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:15,930
If you don't send someone right now,

321
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:16,890
she'll never make it!

322
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,600
I understand, but we can't help you

323
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:20,190
if we don't know where you are.

324
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:22,440
And d'you think if I burn this god
damn gas station down,

325
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,070
maybe you can locate it, huh?!

326
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:38,540
The keys... they keys...

327
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:39,680
Where does the murdering son
of a bitch live?

328
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,940
Shit!

329
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:56,940
Damn it. Where did you go?

330
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:03,680
Why do ya care so much about Alex?

331
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,680
She turns you on, huh?

332
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,270
She does the same thing to me.

333
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:11,400
She turns me on too.

334
01:16:58,310 --> 01:16:59,900
The lights are all out.

335
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:01,610
It looks shut down for the night.

336
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:03,570
Better have a look.

337
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,370
Go around the back, Fred.

338
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:17,330
- And be careful, huh?
- Right, Captain.

339
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:35,970
Captain, the back door is locked.

340
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:36,810
We've gotta...

341
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:39,770
You better call headquarters.

342
01:17:43,770 --> 01:17:45,900
This is patrol car two-fourteen calling.

343
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:49,030
We've got a murder victim here.

344
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:54,910
Patrol car two-fourteen here,
headquarters.

345
01:17:54,990 --> 01:17:58,500
We've got ourselves a murder victim.

346
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:06,010
Oh my God!

347
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:31,410
It's me, Alex. It's me.

348
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:45,670
It's all over.

349
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,980
Ok.

350
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:19,120
There... there.

351
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:34,130
Don't touch me, you hear?

352
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:36,760
Don't touch me I said!

353
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:40,270
It's all over. He's dead, Alex.
He's dead. It's over.

354
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:41,730
What are you saying?

355
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:44,020
- He's dead.
- You don't make any sense!

356
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:47,270
- Get away!
- It's all over,

357
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:50,320
- Alex, all over. Alex...
- Get out!

358
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:56,780
It's over, Alex. I killed him. Don't you.

359
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:00,080
Alex...

360
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,250
...please calm down. He's...
- Get away from me!

361
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:03,410
Don't come near me!

362
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:05,420
Come on Alex, come. It's all over now.

363
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,630
He can never do anything to
you again. Come...

364
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:10,340
You mad bitch!

365
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:13,340
- I'm gonna cut your head into pieces!
- It's me,

366
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:14,760
It's me, Marie, your friend.

367
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,590
I'm on your side!

368
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:19,810
I killed him, Alex.
It's finished. He's dead.

369
01:20:19,890 --> 01:20:22,640
You murdered my whole family!
You murdered my whole family!

370
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:23,810
You don't know what you're saying.

371
01:20:23,890 --> 01:20:25,940
There was nothing
I could do to save them.

372
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:27,940
There was just you...

373
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:31,400
Alex, everything is gonna be okay
from now on.

374
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:34,190
Please, you've got to trust me, Alex.

375
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:38,160
Easy no...

376
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:18,280
You'll pay for this, you little bitch,
you hear?!!

377
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:32,170
I'm gonna take care of you, Alex!

378
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:42,510
I'm gonna take care of you, Alex!

379
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:10,580
Help me... help me... help me!

380
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:15,000
Go on, go! Hurry!

381
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:19,630

- Hurry up! Go go!

382
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:22,800
Go on! Go on!

383
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:28,560
- Hurry, hurry! Faster!
- What the hell is...

384
01:22:29,690 --> 01:22:31,810
Faster, faster, faster!

385
01:22:40,110 --> 01:22:41,990
Come on.

386
01:23:30,370 --> 01:23:33,420
I'll tear your head off!

387
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:13,520

Nobody will come

Never again.

398
01:26:53,070 --> 01:27:27,690
I won't let anyone come
between us anymore...

399
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:40,290
Are you sure she can't see me?
