1
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,352
<i>President Bush is
in Chicago tonight</i>

2
00:02:34,385 --> 00:02:36,491
<i>for a speech to
city business leaders.</i>

3
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,438
<i>Organizers
of an antiwar rally</i>

4
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:40,520
<i>timed to coincide
with his visit</i>

5
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,448
<i>are expecting one of
the biggest turnouts</i>

6
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,072
<i>since before the
invasion of lraq.</i>

7
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:46,892
<i>Experts put the cost
of policing the President's visit</i>

8
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:48,486
<i>at $1.5 million.</i>

9
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:57,251
<i>l remember the president
said something to me like,</i>

10
00:02:57,292 --> 00:03:00,324
''Here goes, Larry,''
and he stepped out.

11
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:02,567
<i>There he is.</i>

12
00:03:05,162 --> 00:03:07,049
For most people,

13
00:03:07,082 --> 00:03:09,950
When a plane touches down
and taxis, there is a feeling of relief.

14
00:03:09,992 --> 00:03:13,701
But for us in the detail, it's a time
when we know we're on,

15
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,385
and... the tension
starts to build.

16
00:03:18,086 --> 00:03:20,955
A million things you have to
worry about come into your head.

17
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:23,169
You get ready
to do your job.

18
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,257
l had a team of agents that arrived
there two weeks in advance,

19
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:31,422
And they'd been liaising with
the Chicago Police Department.

20
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,012
Our intelligence had been
communicating with the FBl.

21
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,417
We had gone over
survey reports.

22
00:03:36,451 --> 00:03:40,159
We all have one in our pocket.
We study it constantly for each site.

23
00:03:40,194 --> 00:03:42,811
We'd gone over
evacuation routes,

24
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,888
Building security,
backup, medical,

25
00:03:44,929 --> 00:03:47,415
Everything at least
a dozen times.

26
00:03:48,831 --> 00:03:51,197
Chicago could be a tough city
in terms of protests,

27
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,139
Just like Portland
or Seattle.

28
00:03:53,181 --> 00:03:56,596
l was just focused on getting him
in and out as quick as we could.

29
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:59,353
We planned to get him to
the Sheraton. He'd make the speech.

30
00:03:59,388 --> 00:04:02,420
Then we'd leave from O'hare
again at 8:40 that night.

31
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,975
When we arrived
in Chicago,

32
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:12,659
l rode in the limo
with President Bush.

33
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:16,111
We were still doing a
little work, which was unusual.

34
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,365
He was in Chicago
to talk about the economy.

35
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:23,504
l had made a pass--
what l thought a final pass--

36
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,428
at the speech
the night before.

37
00:04:25,461 --> 00:04:27,347
He had reread it,
and he said,

38
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,479
''Ellie, we need to work
on this some more.''

39
00:04:30,516 --> 00:04:32,402
Our economy
was struggling.

40
00:04:32,435 --> 00:04:35,118
Oil prices were
through the roof.

41
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:38,002
We were facing a lot
of opposition on all fronts

42
00:04:38,034 --> 00:04:40,968
ln terms of our
policy in lraq.

43
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:45,451
But, as always,
he was confident

44
00:04:45,488 --> 00:04:47,375
that our policies
were correct.

45
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:49,796
lt was just
a matter of time.

46
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:54,669
Chicago hates Bush!
Chicago hates Bush!

47
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,424
Chicago hates Bush!
Chicago hates Bush!

48
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,756
Chicago hates Bush!
Chicago hates Bush!

49
00:04:59,788 --> 00:05:02,504
Chicago hates Bush!
Chicago hates Bush!

50
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:04,394
Chicago hates Bush!

51
00:05:04,428 --> 00:05:06,565
Chicago hates Bush!

52
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,592
You can't keep
a presidential visit

53
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,723
to a city the size
of Chicago a secret.

54
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,141
These various activist groups had
plenty of time to organize as well.

55
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,093
Shame on you!

56
00:05:20,135 --> 00:05:23,582
lt's their constitutional right
to assemble and protest.

57
00:05:23,622 --> 00:05:26,403
l mean, regardless
of what l feel about it,

58
00:05:26,436 --> 00:05:28,542
it's their right to do that,
and l expect that to happen.

59
00:05:28,581 --> 00:05:31,896
ln this particular instance,
what was a big concern to me

60
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:34,305
was that within
the larger organizations

61
00:05:34,338 --> 00:05:37,916
there were some more militant groups
that were completely underground--

62
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:42,012
violent individuals that would
pose a threat to security.

63
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,950
No more Bush!
No more Bush!

64
00:05:44,993 --> 00:05:47,512
l had just been rotated
into the press pool.

65
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:49,820
My vehicle was,
l believe,

66
00:05:49,856 --> 00:05:52,440
three vehicles behind
the president's limo.

67
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,253
And even with the White House
escort, it got ugly.

68
00:05:56,285 --> 00:05:58,172
Everywhere l ever
went with Bush,

69
00:05:58,205 --> 00:06:00,091
we would run
into protesters,

70
00:06:00,124 --> 00:06:02,011
but this time
was different.

71
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:04,693
l mean, this time it seemed
to me there was real hate.

72
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,665
There was a lot
on the White House plate--

73
00:06:07,706 --> 00:06:10,804
lraq, Korea, lran,
plus all the domestic stuff.

74
00:06:10,842 --> 00:06:12,630
lt was like
everybody held Bush

75
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:15,086
personably responsible
for all of it.

76
00:06:15,128 --> 00:06:18,705
When we
turned onto La Salle,

77
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:22,387
And l saw the number of protesters
and the number of cops,

78
00:06:22,422 --> 00:06:26,316
l thought, ''there is no way they're
going to be able to keep control.''

79
00:06:48,656 --> 00:06:51,339
The two operative words
in the First Amendment

80
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,763
are to be peaceful
and law-abiding.

81
00:06:53,807 --> 00:06:55,978
These people broke
barrier lines.

82
00:06:56,014 --> 00:06:57,802
They became violent.

83
00:06:57,837 --> 00:07:00,587
They put the welfare of themselves,
the people around them,

84
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:03,238
and more importantly the
president of the United States

85
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:05,480
in jeopardy by exhibiting
this kind of behavior.

86
00:07:05,516 --> 00:07:09,028
So when that happened,
basically we were in a situation

87
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:11,041
where the gloves
had to come off.

88
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:12,870
That's what had to
happen at that point.

89
00:07:16,105 --> 00:07:19,682
Get off me!

90
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,547
l certainly respect
everyone's right to protest,

91
00:07:31,588 --> 00:07:35,232
but if someone anytime gets
that close to the president,

92
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:38,267
that's not a demonstration
anymore, that's a threat.

93
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:40,543
When that
motorcade stopped,

94
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:43,479
that was
an emergency situation.

95
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:47,317
ln fact, l had my agents in the backup
car make their weapons ready.

96
00:08:00,796 --> 00:08:03,185
l had never seen
anything like that--

97
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:05,813
people actually
making contact

98
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:08,022
With the presidential car.

99
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,808
l mean, that was a major,
major security breach.

100
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:24,243
lt was the angriest
group of protesters

101
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:26,319
l've ever seen
in my entire experience

102
00:08:26,358 --> 00:08:28,245
of working
with the president.

103
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:30,415
l was terrified.
And l looked over,

104
00:08:30,453 --> 00:08:33,235
and the president was
as calm as he could be.

105
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:35,211
And he said,
''you know, Ellie,

106
00:08:35,252 --> 00:08:37,868
l don't mind them
having their opinions.

107
00:08:37,907 --> 00:08:40,722
l just wish they could
demonstrate peacefully.''

108
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,347
We were stretched out
personnel-wise

109
00:08:46,384 --> 00:08:48,272
along the entire
motorcade route.

110
00:08:48,304 --> 00:08:51,151
And at this particular point
in time we were just outmanned.

111
00:08:51,184 --> 00:08:53,638
To me it's like
a heart surgeon--

112
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,566
when a major
artery is clogged,

113
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:57,486
you have to find
another artery A.S.A.P.

114
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,657
or there's going to be
some serious trouble.

115
00:08:59,694 --> 00:09:01,516
And that's what we did.

116
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:04,396
We do have five alternate
routes in play if need be.

117
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:07,744
We did exercise one of those routes.
We contacted the motorcade.

118
00:09:07,787 --> 00:09:09,675
We had to break up
the protesters

119
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:12,161
and get that route going,
and we did do that.

120
00:09:20,584 --> 00:09:23,268
l was very relieved
to get him into the hotel,

121
00:09:23,304 --> 00:09:26,499
which was a secure environment
compared to outside.

122
00:09:27,718 --> 00:09:29,628
The building
was well covered.

123
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,735
lt did have an elevation
which concerned me slightly,

124
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:35,424
but we'd, of course,
secured all the buildings

125
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,881
in the surrounding area,
the adjacent buildings.

126
00:09:41,507 --> 00:09:43,612
We also had multiple
l.D. checks in place

127
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,536
in case any protesters
tried to pose

128
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,609
as G.O.P. volunteers
or media

129
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:50,365
so they could get inside
and cause a disruption.

130
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,541
We say stop the killing,

131
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,916
stop the bombing,
stop the torture,

132
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,146
And stop bankrupting our
neighborhoods and communities

133
00:10:01,181 --> 00:10:04,214
to pay for a war
based on lies.

134
00:10:06,877 --> 00:10:08,884
All right, we want two groups

135
00:10:08,924 --> 00:10:11,989
At Monroe and La Salle
by 5:00 P.M.

136
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,913
No later,
or we'll miss it.

137
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,604
What the fuck, man?

138
00:10:21,816 --> 00:10:24,020
After what happened
with the motorcade,

139
00:10:24,055 --> 00:10:26,258
we sent some officers
in among the protesters

140
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:28,466
to try and identify
the ringleaders.

141
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,917
An individual was stopped
in Federal Plaza.

142
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,161
Our undercover officers
did stop him.

143
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:37,196
We detained him because he had
an unusual amount of information

144
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,144
about the president's
movement that day.

145
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:49,739
Unfortunately, we had no grounds
to detain him at that point,

146
00:10:49,777 --> 00:10:53,736
but we were concerned
that he was one of several people

147
00:10:53,776 --> 00:10:56,142
planning to breach
the security cordon.

148
00:10:56,176 --> 00:10:58,347
How many kids
did you kill today?

149
00:10:58,383 --> 00:11:00,072
Hey, Bush,
what do you say?

150
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:03,144
How many kids did you kill today?
Hey, Bush--

151
00:11:03,182 --> 00:11:05,603
We won't take it no more.

152
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:08,164
- We want money for housing.
- Not for war.

153
00:11:08,204 --> 00:11:11,269
We won't take it no more.
We want money for testing.

154
00:11:11,307 --> 00:11:12,867
Not for war.

155
00:11:12,907 --> 00:11:16,385
No blood for oil!
No blood for oil!

156
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,531
There were four
main rallying points

157
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:20,456
for demonstrators
throughout the city.

158
00:11:20,488 --> 00:11:22,627
My worry was that they
were all now planning

159
00:11:22,664 --> 00:11:24,933
to converge
on the Sheraton.

160
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,961
We'd issued permits
for the demonstrators

161
00:11:28,998 --> 00:11:31,682
which would allow them
to come within three blocks.

162
00:11:31,718 --> 00:11:35,646
After what was going on, there was
no way l was going to let that happen.

163
00:11:35,685 --> 00:11:38,051
We had to get
the protesters pushed back

164
00:11:38,084 --> 00:11:40,986
a significantly further distance
away from the Sheraton

165
00:11:41,028 --> 00:11:43,875
to basically keep
the president secure.

166
00:11:52,225 --> 00:11:54,558
The speech was
about the economy,

167
00:11:54,592 --> 00:11:57,275
but, really,
in the speech

168
00:11:57,312 --> 00:12:00,474
was another warning
to North Korea.

169
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,931
We'd had this wonderful
glimmer of hope,

170
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:06,203
And then the Sea
of Japan incident

171
00:12:06,238 --> 00:12:10,011
put our relations with Kim ll-Jong
back into the deep freeze.

172
00:12:18,937 --> 00:12:20,977
We had intelligence
at the time

173
00:12:21,017 --> 00:12:23,155
that they were
about 18 months

174
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:26,967
from being able to direct
nuclear warheads at American Cities.

175
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,650
They defied the U.N.

176
00:12:29,687 --> 00:12:31,573
Along with lran.

177
00:12:31,606 --> 00:12:33,973
And the president
wanted to make sure

178
00:12:34,006 --> 00:12:35,892
that he was not
misunderstood,

179
00:12:35,925 --> 00:12:38,194
that all options
were on the table,

180
00:12:38,228 --> 00:12:40,715
that we would use
force if necessary.

181
00:12:40,755 --> 00:12:43,505
And we had
to somehow find

182
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:46,408
the language for that
in the speech.

183
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:49,421
Ladies and gentlemen,

184
00:12:49,457 --> 00:12:51,345
Welcome to this
very special meeting

185
00:12:51,378 --> 00:12:53,286
Of the Economic Club
of Chicago.

186
00:12:53,328 --> 00:12:56,873
l'd like to alert you that, because
of the large number of protesters,

187
00:12:56,911 --> 00:12:59,726
Chicago P.D. have forbidden
anyone to be outside

188
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,798
ln the streets
around the hotel

189
00:13:01,838 --> 00:13:05,285
for 20 minutes after the president
leaves the room.

190
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,529
All cars and taxis
will be prohibited

191
00:13:07,565 --> 00:13:09,702
from being in the area,

192
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,260
and foot traffic only
will be allowed.

193
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,892
What does a police state
look like?

194
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,786
This is what a police
state looks like!

195
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:17,542
What does a police state
look like?

196
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:19,465
This is what a police
state looks like!

197
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,253
What does a police state
look like?

198
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,198
This is what a police
state looks like!

199
00:13:23,241 --> 00:13:24,931
What does a police state
look like?

200
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:26,910
This is what a police
state looks like!

201
00:13:26,952 --> 00:13:28,675
What does a police state
look like?

202
00:13:29,703 --> 00:13:30,783
Film them!

203
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:34,815
We'd transitioned a lot
of officers into riot gear;

204
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:37,984
that showed the protesters
that we did mean business.

205
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:42,042
When that motorcade
was compromised,

206
00:13:42,084 --> 00:13:43,971
they were very happy
with themselves.

207
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:46,175
l think it actually
empowered them more,

208
00:13:46,211 --> 00:13:49,309
and that made them
all the more unruly.

209
00:13:49,346 --> 00:13:52,444
Again, this put a lot
of tension in the air.

210
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:55,327
l knew we would need to
exercise a lot of restraint,

211
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:57,247
and...

212
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,548
we just felt that...

213
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:01,470
it was a very
delicate situation.

214
00:14:01,504 --> 00:14:03,390
Ladies and gentlemen,

215
00:14:03,422 --> 00:14:05,462
The president
of the United States.

216
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:32,406
Thank you all very much.

217
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,161
lt's, uh...

218
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:36,467
it's a windy day
out there, which is a...

219
00:14:38,422 --> 00:14:41,235
good day
for a windy speaker.

220
00:14:41,268 --> 00:14:44,748
l-- l'm honored
to be your guest

221
00:14:44,788 --> 00:14:46,729
here at the Economic
Club of Chicago...

222
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,713
lt was a very warm room,

223
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:51,503
and the crowd loved him.

224
00:14:51,538 --> 00:14:55,149
President Bush was at his best
in front of a live audience.

225
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:58,566
This is one of America's
great cities.

226
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:00,495
And one of the reasons why

227
00:15:00,528 --> 00:15:04,072
ls because you have a great
mayor in Richard Daley.

228
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,429
We're from different
political parties,

229
00:15:08,461 --> 00:15:11,941
but we have some
things in common.

230
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,216
We both married
above ourselves.

231
00:15:16,044 --> 00:15:19,042
You know, l don't
think my...

232
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,603
best jokes made it
into that speech.

233
00:15:21,642 --> 00:15:23,365
Uh...

234
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:26,881
Karl Rove always said the president
shouldn't appear to be too funny,

235
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:28,709
But l disagree
with that.

236
00:15:28,745 --> 00:15:30,784
l think that it
doesn't demean

237
00:15:30,824 --> 00:15:33,124
The office of
the Commander ln Chief

238
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:35,046
to have a good punch line
now and then.

239
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,444
We both have famous

240
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,259
and influential...
brothers.

241
00:15:42,853 --> 00:15:45,121
Our dads spent a little
time in politics.

242
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:50,780
And we love our country more
than we love our political parties.

243
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,156
Whenever Bush
would give a speech,

244
00:15:56,192 --> 00:15:59,192
he would do this down-home,
kind of a country-boy thing,

245
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:01,174
and he was
really good at that,

246
00:16:01,216 --> 00:16:04,695
which is kind of strange considering
that he's the son of a president.

247
00:16:04,735 --> 00:16:07,734
He knew what people thought
of him on some level,

248
00:16:07,774 --> 00:16:09,813
and l think he knew
how to work that.

249
00:16:09,854 --> 00:16:11,741
He...

250
00:16:11,773 --> 00:16:14,009
he was very skilled

251
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:17,207
at using the fact that
people underestimated him.

252
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:17,340
We have a responsibility

253
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,129
We have a responsibility

254
00:16:19,163 --> 00:16:21,845
to meet great dangers
to our country

255
00:16:21,883 --> 00:16:23,671
wherever they gather.

256
00:16:23,706 --> 00:16:26,258
One by one

257
00:16:26,297 --> 00:16:29,743
we're showing
these merciless killers

258
00:16:29,784 --> 00:16:31,693
the meaning of justice.

259
00:16:31,737 --> 00:16:33,710
Bring the war home!

260
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:36,653
- lraq, lraq is not alone!
- Bring the war home!

261
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,930
lraq, lraq
is not alone!

262
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,689
Bring the war home!

263
00:16:40,726 --> 00:16:43,246
- lraq, lraq is not alone!
- Bring the war home!

264
00:16:43,285 --> 00:16:45,587
When the president
was making his speech,

265
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:48,936
l was seriously concerned that the
sheer weight and numbers of protesters

266
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:52,327
meant that we'd be looking
at a siege-type situation.

267
00:16:56,305 --> 00:16:59,086
We had over 1 2,000
people on the streets,

268
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,568
and a lot of them were starting
to converge around the hotel.

269
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,469
l think there's
a new breed of anarchist.

270
00:17:06,511 --> 00:17:09,827
These are the people that have
the mentality that anything goes.

271
00:17:09,871 --> 00:17:12,390
And it's a sad fact,
but the only way

272
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:15,494
to deal with this kind of
individual is with brute force.

273
00:17:15,532 --> 00:17:18,150
No justice, no peace.

274
00:17:18,188 --> 00:17:20,194
Fuck the police.

275
00:17:20,234 --> 00:17:22,339
No justice,
no peace.

276
00:17:22,378 --> 00:17:25,923
Fuck the police.
No justice, no peace.

277
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,902
And we're dealing
with North Korea as well.

278
00:17:27,945 --> 00:17:30,945
lt's a regime that has expelled
international inspectors...

279
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:33,982
and is attempting
to defy the world

280
00:17:34,023 --> 00:17:36,739
through its nuclear
weapons program.

281
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:40,293
The United States

282
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,464
and other nations

283
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:44,956
will confront
this threat as well.

284
00:17:44,996 --> 00:17:47,614
We have
no aggressive intent...

285
00:17:49,219 --> 00:17:51,609
no argument with
the North Korean people.

286
00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:54,840
We're interested
in peace...

287
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:59,039
on the Korean peninsula.

288
00:17:59,073 --> 00:18:00,961
As we deal with
the dangers of our time,

289
00:18:00,993 --> 00:18:05,051
different circumstances
require different strategies.

290
00:18:05,087 --> 00:18:08,981
Yet, our resolve
in each case will be clear.

291
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,543
We will not permit
any regime

292
00:18:11,582 --> 00:18:13,883
to threaten the freedom
and security

293
00:18:13,917 --> 00:18:15,804
of the American people

294
00:18:15,837 --> 00:18:19,414
or our allies and friends
around the world.

295
00:18:25,594 --> 00:18:28,407
When you're writing
speeches for the president,

296
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,026
it's kind of like
playing tennis

297
00:18:31,064 --> 00:18:34,261
with a really
gigantic racket, you know?

298
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:37,230
You have all this power
in your hand.

299
00:18:37,271 --> 00:18:41,230
You just have to be sure
to hit the ball softly.

300
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,652
We're meeting
the challenges to America.

301
00:18:44,693 --> 00:18:46,732
We're strengthening
our economy,

302
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:48,844
and we're taking
the battle to our enemies.

303
00:18:50,132 --> 00:18:52,041
By the courage
and by the enterprise

304
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,766
of the American people,

305
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:57,584
this great nation
will prosper.

306
00:18:57,618 --> 00:18:59,951
And there's
no doubt in my mind

307
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:02,570
this great nation
will prevail.

308
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,680
May God bless you all,

309
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:06,475
And may God
bless America.

310
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,886
Stop the war!
Burn it down!

311
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:34,718
Move back
from the barricade!

312
00:19:37,128 --> 00:19:39,101
We're not going to move!

313
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,200
Move back beyond
lllinois street!

314
00:19:43,238 --> 00:19:46,433
You have to understand, we asked
these people to move back.

315
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:49,316
They did not. Not only
did they not move back,

316
00:19:49,349 --> 00:19:51,616
they were spitting
at our officers.

317
00:19:51,651 --> 00:19:53,953
They were doing every
single thing they could

318
00:19:53,988 --> 00:19:55,896
to push their buttons
and to incite them.

319
00:19:55,938 --> 00:19:57,727
l... absolutely not.

320
00:19:57,762 --> 00:20:00,096
We took
the appropriate action.

321
00:20:00,129 --> 00:20:03,030
On my command,
push and spray!

322
00:20:06,432 --> 00:20:08,668
Push and spray!

323
00:20:47,253 --> 00:20:49,619
He was in a good mood.
His speech went well

324
00:20:49,653 --> 00:20:51,987
and he had a sort of
informal meet and greet

325
00:20:52,021 --> 00:20:54,889
with some of the guests
that were there.

326
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:04,618
as soon as we could,
we took the president

327
00:21:04,658 --> 00:21:06,566
to a holding area,
which is the norm.

328
00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:08,495
lt gives us
a chance to check in

329
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:10,698
and address any
last-minute security issues.

330
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:12,622
lt also gives
the president some time

331
00:21:12,654 --> 00:21:14,661
to make any phone calls
he needs to make

332
00:21:14,703 --> 00:21:16,611
and check in with members
of his staff.

333
00:21:18,061 --> 00:21:19,849
l was very uncomfortable

334
00:21:19,885 --> 00:21:21,826
with the president
doing the rope line

335
00:21:21,868 --> 00:21:24,421
that he was scheduled
to do on the way out,

336
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,012
probably because of the
events earlier in the day--

337
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:29,025
the motorcade
being stopped.

338
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:30,953
l thought we should
pass on this one

339
00:21:30,985 --> 00:21:32,960
and l made
my feelings known.

340
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:36,383
He told me that l was
the only person around him

341
00:21:36,425 --> 00:21:38,791
that ever told him no.

342
00:21:38,823 --> 00:21:40,449
But...

343
00:21:40,487 --> 00:21:42,375
he was determined
to do it.

344
00:21:42,407 --> 00:21:44,381
The speech had gone well.
He was in a good mood.

345
00:21:44,422 --> 00:21:47,138
He did not want to disappoint the people
who had showed up to meet him.

346
00:21:52,356 --> 00:21:54,942
l checked ahead with my agents
on the main entrance.

347
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,247
Everyone there had been
searched and ''magged.''

348
00:21:57,284 --> 00:22:00,216
They'd been through the magnetometer,
which means no one had a weapon.

349
00:22:00,258 --> 00:22:03,901
Everything that we, the Secret
Service, could do had been done.

350
00:22:03,937 --> 00:22:06,971
But sometimes you
just have a feeling.

351
00:22:08,032 --> 00:22:10,071
Not necessarily a...

352
00:22:10,112 --> 00:22:13,111
rational feeling that you could
base on anything concrete,

353
00:22:13,151 --> 00:22:15,518
but l just...

354
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,811
had a bad feeling
about that rope line.

355
00:22:19,933 --> 00:22:21,940
l reiterated
my concerns to him,

356
00:22:21,981 --> 00:22:24,915
and he looked
at me and said,

357
00:22:24,956 --> 00:22:28,087
''Larry, is there
a problem?''

358
00:22:29,274 --> 00:22:31,249
l remember saying...

359
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:35,918
''No, sir, there's no--
there's no problem.''

360
00:22:41,207 --> 00:22:43,629
Good to see you.

361
00:22:43,671 --> 00:22:46,669
Howdy.
How are you?

362
00:22:50,644 --> 00:22:53,840
Very inspiring,
Mr. President.

363
00:22:53,876 --> 00:22:55,915
Thanks.
Nice to see ya.

364
00:22:55,955 --> 00:22:57,961
- Gonna sing in a minute.
- That's what l heard.

365
00:22:58,003 --> 00:23:00,043
Thank you.
Hey there.

366
00:23:00,082 --> 00:23:02,220
Nice to see you all.

367
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:03,915
- Hey there.
- God bless.

368
00:23:03,954 --> 00:23:05,896
- l'm praying for you.
- Thank you. Thanks.

369
00:23:05,938 --> 00:23:09,035
When the president looks you
in the eye and shakes your hand,

370
00:23:09,073 --> 00:23:10,959
there is no one else
in the world.

371
00:23:10,992 --> 00:23:13,839
He devotes himself
to you 100o/.

372
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:15,813
And that's where
he was that night.

373
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:18,919
He was shaking hands
with the people of Chicago.

374
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,965
Good to see you all.

375
00:23:22,221 --> 00:23:25,002
Good to see you.
Hi there.

376
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:27,817
What's your name?
Nice to meet you.

377
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,748
What do you think?

378
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:33,826
l look for anything
that seems out of place,

379
00:23:33,866 --> 00:23:36,418
Anything that
looks wrong.

380
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,352
Some agents
look at hands.

381
00:23:40,391 --> 00:23:42,214
l look at eyes,

382
00:23:42,248 --> 00:23:44,702
and l look for that stare,
for that look that says,

383
00:23:44,743 --> 00:23:47,393
''l'm not a big fan
of the president.''

384
00:23:49,605 --> 00:23:51,842
- Good to see you.
- Good morning.

385
00:23:51,878 --> 00:23:53,731
Hey there.
Thank you.

386
00:23:53,764 --> 00:23:56,481
- President Bush.
- Hi. Thanks for wearing that shirt.

387
00:23:56,515 --> 00:23:58,403
- Good to see you, sir.
- Good luck to you, sir.

388
00:23:58,435 --> 00:24:00,224
Thank you.
How are you all doing?

389
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:03,128
And then l saw
Danny Williams.

390
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:12,181
Danny Williams was a guy
who'd been following the president.

391
00:24:12,224 --> 00:24:14,972
He showed up to any event
that he could afford to get to.

392
00:24:15,007 --> 00:24:16,917
He was one of these
environmental nuts.

393
00:24:19,037 --> 00:24:21,307
This guy had
a screw loose.

394
00:24:21,341 --> 00:24:24,155
He should never have been
allowed on the rope line.

395
00:24:24,189 --> 00:24:26,937
So l felt very relieved
when we dealt with him

396
00:24:26,972 --> 00:24:29,339
before he had a chance
to make a scene.

397
00:24:35,418 --> 00:24:37,522
Thank you.

398
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,113
Get down!

399
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,949
Shots fired!
Shots fired!

400
00:24:53,174 --> 00:24:55,245
Here he is!
He's here!

401
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,074
Gotta get out of here.
Somebody shot him.

402
00:25:07,218 --> 00:25:10,600
l moved my hands along his body
to see where he had been hit.

403
00:25:10,641 --> 00:25:13,639
He was bleeding from his chest,
and he was having trouble breathing.

404
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,784
So l tried keep
the airway passage open,

405
00:25:15,822 --> 00:25:18,124
And l was just praying
that he would keep breathing

406
00:25:18,158 --> 00:25:19,435
until we got to the hospital.

407
00:25:19,471 --> 00:25:22,437
Stay calm.
Stay calm.

408
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:30,439
This guy is 7-0!
This guy is 7-0!

409
00:25:48,902 --> 00:25:51,422
Stay back!
Stay right here!

410
00:25:51,462 --> 00:25:54,909
Nobody leave!
No one leaves till l say it's clear!

411
00:25:54,949 --> 00:25:57,055
Nobody move!
Nobody move!

412
00:25:57,093 --> 00:25:59,579
Stay back!
Everybody stay back!

413
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,790
Hit the ground.

414
00:26:04,547 --> 00:26:07,710
Nobody leave!
Nobody leave!

415
00:26:07,746 --> 00:26:10,046
We're just getting reports
of a shooting incident

416
00:26:10,081 --> 00:26:11,968
at the Chicago Sheraton

417
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,204
where President Bush
has been speaking.

418
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,761
lt's not clear if the president
himself has been hit,

419
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,903
but apparently
there are casualties.

420
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,129
The Secret Service's job
is to protect the president.

421
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,538
The moment they fail
at that, it comes to me.

422
00:26:32,572 --> 00:26:34,458
My job,
and the Bureau's job,

423
00:26:34,491 --> 00:26:36,824
is to find the attacker
and bring him to justice.

424
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:48,848
As far as l was concerned,
the gunman was there somewhere.

425
00:26:48,886 --> 00:26:52,202
And the odds of catching the person
or persons responsible for this

426
00:26:52,245 --> 00:26:54,318
were going down
by the second.

427
00:26:56,309 --> 00:26:58,348
The Secret Service
believed initially

428
00:26:58,389 --> 00:27:01,006
that the shots had been fired
from within the rope line...

429
00:27:02,644 --> 00:27:04,781
but all the guests
had been searched.

430
00:27:04,818 --> 00:27:07,982
And soon it emerged that several
of the witnesses on the rope line

431
00:27:08,018 --> 00:27:09,959
indicated that
the shots had come

432
00:27:10,002 --> 00:27:13,165
from one of the tall buildings
overlooking the Sheraton.

433
00:27:24,014 --> 00:27:27,177
Every available officer was out
searching the area for a suspect,

434
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:30,212
but we had no idea what
he or she looked like.

435
00:27:30,252 --> 00:27:32,194
then, three minutes
after the shooting,

436
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:34,058
officers saw
an individual run

437
00:27:34,091 --> 00:27:36,512
from one of the buildings
overlooking the hotel

438
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:40,002
and into the building
next door-- 420 North Park.

439
00:27:41,354 --> 00:27:43,524
The SWAT team
was sent over,

440
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:45,765
and the individual
was detained at gunpoint.

441
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,101
We'd run him out by the
time they got him back

442
00:27:48,136 --> 00:27:50,207
to Metropolitan
Correctional Center.

443
00:27:52,007 --> 00:27:55,039
He'd actually been stopped
by Chicago P.D. earlier in the day.

444
00:27:56,325 --> 00:27:59,673
His name was Frank Molini.
He was 28,

445
00:27:59,717 --> 00:28:01,888
pretty much
a full-time activist.

446
00:28:01,924 --> 00:28:05,666
He had been kicked out of the University
of lllinois in Chicago after a year.

447
00:28:05,699 --> 00:28:09,179
He was part of a group
of protesters

448
00:28:09,219 --> 00:28:12,120
that were subject
of an NSA wiretap

449
00:28:12,161 --> 00:28:14,200
back in 2004,

450
00:28:14,241 --> 00:28:16,858
kids who had planned
a break-in

451
00:28:16,897 --> 00:28:20,473
during the Republican National
Convention in New York in 2004.

452
00:28:22,751 --> 00:28:25,084
He broke through the cordon
into a restricted area

453
00:28:25,118 --> 00:28:27,158
when the president
was speaking.

454
00:28:27,198 --> 00:28:30,230
Right there we had
something to charge him with.

455
00:28:34,363 --> 00:28:36,632
They cuff me
and throw me in a van,

456
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:39,733
take me down
to the detention center.

457
00:28:39,771 --> 00:28:41,874
l just sat silent,

458
00:28:41,913 --> 00:28:44,280
let 'em ask all the questions
in the world they wanted.

459
00:28:44,314 --> 00:28:46,199
l wasn't going
to help 'em out.

460
00:28:46,233 --> 00:28:49,232
l just didn't
want to cooperate.

461
00:28:49,272 --> 00:28:51,760
lf you believe
in the death penalty,

462
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,653
he was a candidate.

463
00:28:53,686 --> 00:28:55,758
You know, he...

464
00:28:57,333 --> 00:29:01,675
he had been responsible
for over 100,000 deaths,

465
00:29:01,716 --> 00:29:04,465
and if he had
been... tried

466
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,794
in a war crimes tribunal
and found guilty...

467
00:29:09,011 --> 00:29:12,359
then... he would have
been a candidate.

468
00:29:17,425 --> 00:29:19,366
Okay, move it through here.
move it through.

469
00:29:19,408 --> 00:29:21,895
l didn't know if he
could hear me or not,

470
00:29:21,936 --> 00:29:23,909
but l tried willing him
to stay alive,

471
00:29:23,951 --> 00:29:26,884
to keep breathing, keep breathing
until we got to the hospital.

472
00:29:30,222 --> 00:29:33,384
we were there so quick that the
hospital had not completely finished

473
00:29:33,421 --> 00:29:35,809
clearing out an area,
securing it for the president.

474
00:29:35,852 --> 00:29:37,794
And we got him
inside the hospital,

475
00:29:37,835 --> 00:29:40,387
and... the medical
staff took over.

476
00:29:40,426 --> 00:29:42,793
And l just... just...

477
00:29:42,826 --> 00:29:44,548
kept... saying,

478
00:29:44,586 --> 00:29:47,879
''please, please...
please don't let him die.''

479
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:51,456
Who's been injured?

480
00:29:51,496 --> 00:29:54,015
- Can you tell us anything?
- Anything you got.

481
00:29:54,055 --> 00:29:55,777
Basically, we have
this information:

482
00:29:55,813 --> 00:29:58,661
he's been hit twice. He's being
treated for his injuries.

483
00:29:58,693 --> 00:30:01,921
That's literally all l can tell you
about the president at this time.

484
00:30:01,957 --> 00:30:03,746
- lt's the president?
- The president.

485
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:10,363
Did he say anything?

486
00:30:10,403 --> 00:30:12,289
We was all
in the emergency room,

487
00:30:12,322 --> 00:30:15,289
and the Secret Service people came in
and said, ''get out, get out.''

488
00:30:15,329 --> 00:30:17,052
And then they said,
''get the hell out.''

489
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,812
So that's when
l got up out of there.

490
00:30:18,848 --> 00:30:21,214
What is the state of the president?
ls he conscious?

491
00:30:21,247 --> 00:30:23,452
- ls he bleeding?
- They brought the president in.

492
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:25,525
That's when l seen him.
He was on a stretcher

493
00:30:25,566 --> 00:30:27,835
and he was unconscious.
He wasn't talking a lot.

494
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:35,479
They shot Bush.
They shot the president!

495
00:30:35,516 --> 00:30:38,897
- They shot Bush!
- Bush has been shot!

496
00:30:47,193 --> 00:30:49,777
We determined
that the shots were fired

497
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:52,401
from the 20th floor
of 422 North Park.

498
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,340
lmmediately, we locked
that building down.

499
00:30:55,383 --> 00:30:57,270
We seized
the surveillance footage

500
00:30:57,302 --> 00:30:59,342
from both the building
and the city cameras.

501
00:30:59,382 --> 00:31:01,356
We got the employee list
from the building.

502
00:31:01,397 --> 00:31:05,106
We wanted to know the names
of everyone who worked there,

503
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:08,488
or who had been in and out
of the building within the past week.

504
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:22,566
Like at any crime scene,
you'll have

505
00:31:22,608 --> 00:31:24,941
the local law enforcement,
your first responders.

506
00:31:24,975 --> 00:31:27,047
ln this case, you had
the Chicago field office

507
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:28,973
of the FBl
on the scene immediately.

508
00:31:29,005 --> 00:31:31,427
The E.R.T. from D.C.--

509
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:34,284
that's the Evidence
Response Team--

510
00:31:34,316 --> 00:31:35,527
they fly in.

511
00:31:35,565 --> 00:31:37,091
They get there
in about 90 minutes,

512
00:31:37,132 --> 00:31:39,521
and they start going through
the evidence.

513
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,285
And then they start
sending stuff

514
00:31:41,323 --> 00:31:43,178
to their forensic lab

515
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,097
at Quantico,
which is where l was.

516
00:31:45,129 --> 00:31:47,366
So we started getting stuff
within a few hours.

517
00:31:49,544 --> 00:31:52,740
They identified the room
that the shooting took place in.

518
00:31:52,776 --> 00:31:57,117
And so there was a lot of
forensic evidence in that room.

519
00:31:57,158 --> 00:31:59,045
You know, a sniper
is in a hurry.

520
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:01,444
He's acting fast, and he's
going to make mistakes.

521
00:32:01,478 --> 00:32:04,128
And those mistakes
are what you want

522
00:32:04,164 --> 00:32:06,171
because those
are evidence.

523
00:32:14,178 --> 00:32:16,447
lt was a very promising
scene forensically,

524
00:32:16,482 --> 00:32:18,521
because you had
a lot of evidence.

525
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,408
You had...

526
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,327
hair and fiber

527
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,970
and... literally shell casings.
You had an open window.

528
00:32:27,006 --> 00:32:30,388
There were a couple hundred
fingerprints from that room.

529
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,404
Then what you're trying
to do is match that

530
00:32:32,446 --> 00:32:35,674
with what they call
a ''person of interest.''

531
00:33:12,499 --> 00:33:15,401
l was going back
to my car

532
00:33:15,442 --> 00:33:17,165
down on lake,

533
00:33:17,201 --> 00:33:19,568
and these cops just, like,
came out of nowhere,

534
00:33:19,602 --> 00:33:23,495
jumped out of the car,
threw me up against this gate,

535
00:33:23,536 --> 00:33:26,852
you know, being all aggressive,
asking me for my l.D.

536
00:33:26,896 --> 00:33:29,994
l showed it to 'em,
and they put me in cuffs,

537
00:33:30,031 --> 00:33:32,202
threw me in the back
of the car

538
00:33:32,238 --> 00:33:35,172
and took me in and started
asking me all these questions.

539
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,514
They saw l was a vet.

540
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,638
They assumed l was
there for the protest.

541
00:33:41,675 --> 00:33:43,650
l told them l wasn't.

542
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:46,439
Told them these people had a right
to protest if they wanted to.

543
00:33:46,474 --> 00:33:49,407
My dad did, right after
David got killed.

544
00:33:49,448 --> 00:33:52,515
But l just never chose to
get caught up in that stuff.

545
00:33:52,553 --> 00:33:55,073
lt didn't make no sense
to me to be out there

546
00:33:55,112 --> 00:33:58,339
screaming and yelling at Bush
when he wasn't going to listen no way.

547
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:29,722
The last time
l saw the First Lady,

548
00:34:29,759 --> 00:34:33,140
we were speaking
about how eager she was

549
00:34:33,182 --> 00:34:35,930
for the president
to leave office very soon,

550
00:34:35,964 --> 00:34:39,128
and their time
together after.

551
00:34:39,165 --> 00:34:41,051
When she arrived
at the hospital,

552
00:34:41,084 --> 00:34:43,353
she had her...

553
00:34:43,388 --> 00:34:45,361
ever-present dignity,

554
00:34:45,402 --> 00:34:48,271
but you could tell, of course,
that she was devastated.

555
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:54,482
l was being constantly
informed by the doctors.

556
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,429
l knew it was
quite grave.

557
00:34:56,471 --> 00:35:00,365
l knew that his chances
were slim at that time.

558
00:35:03,255 --> 00:35:05,675
We stepped
into the elevator,

559
00:35:05,717 --> 00:35:08,651
and l felt Mrs. Bush
scanning my face

560
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:10,415
for any clue,

561
00:35:10,452 --> 00:35:13,298
any sign of how
things were going.

562
00:35:13,331 --> 00:35:15,752
And l couldn't speak.

563
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:21,996
Okay, l have
a short statement.

564
00:35:22,033 --> 00:35:24,172
The president suffered
two bullet wounds.

565
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:27,055
The first entered just
under the right armpit.

566
00:35:27,088 --> 00:35:29,836
lt traversed about three
inches of the chest wall,

567
00:35:29,871 --> 00:35:33,132
then ricocheted off
the fifth rib and exited.

568
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:34,988
The second
damaged the aorta

569
00:35:35,022 --> 00:35:37,640
and passed into the left
lower lobe of the lung.

570
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:39,684
That bullet has
now been removed.

571
00:35:39,725 --> 00:35:42,659
The president is about
to undergo a surgical procedure

572
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,863
to repair some
of the inferior aorta.

573
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,484
Although his injuries
are very serious,

574
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:52,034
Dr. Wu has said he's never
seen such a strong heart

575
00:35:52,074 --> 00:35:54,375
in a man
of the president's age.

576
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:57,026
So the outlook
is good, very good.

577
00:35:57,065 --> 00:35:59,551
That's all.

578
00:36:16,738 --> 00:36:18,626
The gun was found
in the bottom

579
00:36:18,658 --> 00:36:20,600
of a garbage chute
in the building.

580
00:36:20,642 --> 00:36:23,259
lt was a US-made
sniper rifle,

581
00:36:23,298 --> 00:36:26,395
which is certainly an extremely
strong piece of evidence,

582
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:29,180
although there
were problems.

583
00:36:29,216 --> 00:36:31,157
lt's very tricky,
actually,

584
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,173
to find fingerprints
on a gun,

585
00:36:33,214 --> 00:36:36,694
because a gun
is very oily,

586
00:36:36,733 --> 00:36:39,733
the handle of a gun
is often textured,

587
00:36:39,773 --> 00:36:42,838
and fingerprints just...

588
00:36:42,877 --> 00:36:44,818
aren't easily
found on guns,

589
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,707
even though you might think
they are, from the movies.

590
00:36:49,242 --> 00:36:53,202
The serial number of the gun
had been removed.

591
00:36:53,241 --> 00:36:55,892
So this suggested
that this was done

592
00:36:55,928 --> 00:36:58,480
by someone who was
very professional.

593
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:35,546
4:00 A.M., we had about
300 people in custody.

594
00:38:37,598 --> 00:38:40,020
The truth is, the sheer
volume of detainees

595
00:38:40,062 --> 00:38:43,377
that we had as a result of the
material-witness statutes

596
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,289
made the task
very very difficult.

597
00:38:46,332 --> 00:38:49,910
You know, in a normal
homicide investigation

598
00:38:49,947 --> 00:38:51,834
motive is very helpful

599
00:38:51,866 --> 00:38:54,832
in narrowing down a list
of potential suspects.

600
00:38:54,873 --> 00:38:57,721
But... in this case,
two hours before the shooting,

601
00:38:57,754 --> 00:39:00,852
we... saw over
10,000 protesters,

602
00:39:00,889 --> 00:39:03,255
displaying what,
in many cases,

603
00:39:03,287 --> 00:39:07,061
was overt hatred
for the president himself.

604
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,745
Sure, the vast majority
of those were peaceful protesters

605
00:39:09,783 --> 00:39:12,629
exercising their rights
under the constitution,

606
00:39:12,662 --> 00:39:16,588
but among them were also some
much more militant individuals--

607
00:39:16,628 --> 00:39:19,594
people like Frank Molini who
somehow got hold of information

608
00:39:19,635 --> 00:39:21,456
about the president's
schedule,

609
00:39:21,491 --> 00:39:23,857
which should not have been
out in the public domain.

610
00:39:28,689 --> 00:39:30,663
The Bush administration
had tried

611
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:32,907
to trash
civil liberties.

612
00:39:32,943 --> 00:39:36,718
So as a protest movement,
we had to get smarter.

613
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:38,726
We had to go
for what we called

614
00:39:38,767 --> 00:39:40,805
''intelligence-led
protests.''

615
00:39:40,846 --> 00:39:43,301
We had...

616
00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:45,228
to get information
like this,

617
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,871
because Bush had
made it so impossible

618
00:39:48,907 --> 00:39:51,755
to have
a meaningful protest,

619
00:39:51,787 --> 00:39:55,561
that having this
information allowed us

620
00:39:55,594 --> 00:39:57,568
to make ourselves seen.

621
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,912
l saw some Secret Service
guys talking to the cops.

622
00:40:02,952 --> 00:40:04,839
And then,
all of a sudden,

623
00:40:04,872 --> 00:40:07,653
it seems like the cordon
was too close to the hotel.

624
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:12,321
This was just the pattern
that always happens in Chicago.

625
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:14,845
You have a permit
to protest,

626
00:40:14,885 --> 00:40:17,950
and Bush just stomps
all over them.

627
00:40:20,355 --> 00:40:22,689
As the fight started,

628
00:40:22,723 --> 00:40:25,244
l ran through
the police line,

629
00:40:25,283 --> 00:40:27,005
and nobody stopped me.

630
00:40:28,705 --> 00:40:32,250
l was trying to get in any
building opposite the Sheraton,

631
00:40:32,353 --> 00:40:34,719
and l tried a few doors
that were locked.

632
00:40:34,751 --> 00:40:37,533
And then finally
l found this revolving door

633
00:40:37,567 --> 00:40:39,868
that was open,
and l went in.

634
00:40:39,902 --> 00:40:42,586
And the minute l got in,
l just completely lost my nerve

635
00:40:42,623 --> 00:40:44,661
'cause there was
this guy coming at me.

636
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,034
So l just turned around and
went right back out and ran.

637
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,969
l had the banner on me,

638
00:40:51,004 --> 00:40:53,622
and l planned on going
to a building opposite

639
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:57,368
and hanging this banner
so that Bush would be forced to see

640
00:40:57,402 --> 00:40:59,888
how we feel
as a people.

641
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:08,047
When we realized Molini
couldn't have pulled the trigger,

642
00:41:08,086 --> 00:41:09,810
we turned our attention
to another man

643
00:41:09,847 --> 00:41:13,261
who broke through the cordon
within seconds of Molini.

644
00:41:16,276 --> 00:41:20,018
We'd identified the man in the
white baseball cap as Samir Masri.

645
00:41:20,053 --> 00:41:22,735
He was picked up
at a vehicle checkpoint,

646
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:26,698
trying to leave the downtown area
about an hour after the shooting.

647
00:41:31,409 --> 00:41:34,158
l knew, right when they
looked at my lD, they knew.

648
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:36,811
My family's from Yemen,
but l'm an American citizen.

649
00:41:36,848 --> 00:41:38,887
l was born in Detroit.

650
00:41:38,927 --> 00:41:40,836
l'm a Lions fan.

651
00:41:40,878 --> 00:41:43,944
They didn't read me my rights.
They didn't offer me a lawyer.

652
00:41:43,982 --> 00:41:48,454
They didn't tell me anything about
why they were questioning me.

653
00:41:48,493 --> 00:41:52,867
They told me that they knew
my father was a terrorist as well.

654
00:41:52,907 --> 00:41:56,484
He was arrested after 9/11 because,
when he came here from Yemen,

655
00:41:56,523 --> 00:41:59,905
it was on a tourist visa,
and he decided to stay.

656
00:41:59,946 --> 00:42:03,109
Millions of people overstay
on their tourist visa.

657
00:42:03,144 --> 00:42:05,446
Millions. l mean,
that doesn't make it right,

658
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,389
but it also doesn't
make them a terrorist.

659
00:42:08,615 --> 00:42:10,501
Bush and Ashcroft
deported

660
00:42:10,534 --> 00:42:13,403
my mother, my father
and my brother,

661
00:42:13,446 --> 00:42:15,901
and that's why
l was here protesting.

662
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,133
They said that
if l didn't cooperate,

663
00:42:19,171 --> 00:42:22,238
l could be declared
an enemy combatant.

664
00:42:22,276 --> 00:42:25,145
l could lose my rights
to a civil trial.

665
00:42:27,362 --> 00:42:29,533
We weren't just
rounding up people.

666
00:42:29,569 --> 00:42:32,350
We had probable cause
every single time.

667
00:42:32,385 --> 00:42:34,687
Also many of the suspects
were detained

668
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,654
due to the description of a
non-white male seen on the 20th floor

669
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,637
of 422 North Park
earlier in the day.

670
00:42:41,438 --> 00:42:43,675
We needed to establish
if this was the same man

671
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,978
seen leaving the service area
under the building

672
00:42:46,014 --> 00:42:47,923
three minutes
after the shooting

673
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:50,037
or the man who was seen
leaving the building

674
00:42:50,076 --> 00:42:52,279
as Molini tried
to go in;

675
00:42:52,316 --> 00:42:54,257
or if it was
Casey Claybon,

676
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,811
seen crossing lake street a couple
of minutes prior to his arrest.

677
00:43:02,234 --> 00:43:04,502
That day l'd been
looking for work.

678
00:43:04,537 --> 00:43:07,504
l went down to the veteran
one-stop center.

679
00:43:07,545 --> 00:43:09,715
l was a mess.

680
00:43:09,751 --> 00:43:12,239
l broke up
with my wife.

681
00:43:12,279 --> 00:43:14,318
Couldn't stand to be
around my parents.

682
00:43:15,414 --> 00:43:17,650
Caught back up
using drugs again.

683
00:43:19,253 --> 00:43:23,026
Biggest conversation we had
when l first got to lraq

684
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:25,742
was, ''how are we going to be
looked at when we get back home?''

685
00:43:25,779 --> 00:43:28,561
You know, are we going
to be looked at as heroes,

686
00:43:28,595 --> 00:43:31,561
or these fools over there
fighting for Bush?

687
00:43:31,601 --> 00:43:34,469
You know, that's what was
going on through my mind that day.

688
00:43:35,856 --> 00:43:39,717
You know, these people are not
looking at us as heroes.

689
00:43:39,759 --> 00:43:41,832
We look like
fools to them.

690
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:14,277
l was being informed
in the course of the evening,

691
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:16,928
along with Mrs. Bush...

692
00:44:16,966 --> 00:44:19,834
but l don't think
l really understood

693
00:44:19,878 --> 00:44:21,764
the extent
of the injuries

694
00:44:21,797 --> 00:44:24,034
until about 1 :30
in the morning

695
00:44:24,069 --> 00:44:27,264
when l called up and said,
''how's my boss doing?''

696
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:33,279
And the nurse started crying,
and l think that was when l knew.

697
00:44:34,913 --> 00:44:37,662
l immediately went
to the chapel

698
00:44:37,696 --> 00:44:40,631
to talk to Mrs. Bush
and to pray with her.

699
00:44:42,783 --> 00:44:45,597
The country entrusts us
to protect our president.

700
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:47,289
That's our job.

701
00:44:47,326 --> 00:44:50,107
You don't do ''a pretty good job''
of protecting the president.

702
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:52,507
You either do it,
or you don't.

703
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:54,743
And the Secret Service
failed that day,

704
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,689
and l failed.

705
00:44:58,778 --> 00:45:00,982
This is not official,
but a source

706
00:45:01,018 --> 00:45:03,156
inside the hospital
has confirmed--

707
00:45:03,193 --> 00:45:06,040
We are hearing from a source
inside the hospital that--

708
00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:08,276
The word from
Northwestern Hospital...

709
00:45:08,313 --> 00:45:11,279
...is that the 43rd president,
George W. Bush...

710
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,497
- ...is dead.
- ...died.

711
00:45:12,536 --> 00:45:16,014
- ...died.
- ...died a short while ago.

712
00:45:16,054 --> 00:45:17,996
He was 61.

713
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:20,492
Vice President Cheney
is in a secure location.

714
00:45:20,533 --> 00:45:22,421
We don't know
where he is,

715
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:25,551
but will presumably take
the oath of office shortly

716
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:29,384
to become the 44th president
of the United States.

717
00:45:50,222 --> 00:45:52,708
The word from Chicago
is that--

718
00:46:01,386 --> 00:46:04,005
...to become the 44th
president...

719
00:46:32,611 --> 00:46:34,814
We did manage to question
most of the people

720
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:38,264
who left 422 North Park around
the time of the shooting.

721
00:46:39,776 --> 00:46:42,710
But there were a few people
who didn't come forward,

722
00:46:42,751 --> 00:46:44,639
including the man
seen leaving

723
00:46:44,671 --> 00:46:47,037
at the time Molini tried
to get into the building.

724
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:49,438
We showed the tapes
to the security guards,

725
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:51,673
but they didn't
recognize him.

726
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:55,003
So we searched
through the employee list.

727
00:46:59,771 --> 00:47:03,893
lt's true that we did start
to look at lslamic names first,

728
00:47:03,931 --> 00:47:07,475
but, as we see it, it's not
racial profiling as some have suggested.

729
00:47:07,513 --> 00:47:10,645
lt's just a common sense approach
to a situation of this kind.

730
00:47:11,928 --> 00:47:14,034
Turned out this man
had recently got a job

731
00:47:14,072 --> 00:47:16,853
with an l.T. firm
on the 18th floor.

732
00:47:16,886 --> 00:47:20,398
We identified him
as Jamal Abu Zikri.

733
00:48:27,749 --> 00:48:30,879
The forensics guys went
to work on Zikri's apartment,

734
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:33,469
basically recovering
anything that could contain

735
00:48:33,508 --> 00:48:36,376
fibers or a trace
that could link Zikri

736
00:48:36,418 --> 00:48:39,581
to 422 North Park
or to the weapon.

737
00:48:39,618 --> 00:48:42,006
But my main focus was
how Zikri did at interview.

738
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:49,624
ln what was obviously

739
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:52,345
a very tense atmosphere--

740
00:48:52,382 --> 00:48:55,448
going into the Metro
Correctional Center,

741
00:48:55,485 --> 00:48:57,307
up to the fourth floor,

742
00:48:57,341 --> 00:49:00,307
into the ''A''
interrogation room--

743
00:49:00,347 --> 00:49:02,453
everyone was
rather distraught,

744
00:49:02,492 --> 00:49:04,345
rather tense.

745
00:49:04,379 --> 00:49:07,127
And there in the room
sat a man

746
00:49:07,163 --> 00:49:09,583
who appeared to have

747
00:49:09,626 --> 00:49:12,920
no emotional turbulence
whatsoever.

748
00:49:12,953 --> 00:49:16,116
Conspicuously cool.

749
00:49:16,152 --> 00:49:19,796
l went in with the intention of having
just a pleasant conversation with him,

750
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,717
just to get
a measure of him,

751
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,597
to get a feel for him.

752
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:26,995
And my immediate
impression

753
00:49:27,029 --> 00:49:30,377
was that this was a man
with no conscience whatsoever.

754
00:49:30,421 --> 00:49:34,576
He read as a sociopath,
essentially--

755
00:49:34,611 --> 00:49:38,320
no identifiable emotion

756
00:49:38,354 --> 00:49:40,176
behind what
he was saying,

757
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,216
no visible
state of mind.

758
00:49:42,258 --> 00:49:45,323
He seemed completely
unaffected by my questions.

759
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,418
We might have been talking
about wallpaper samples

760
00:49:49,455 --> 00:49:52,717
rather than the shooting
of a president.

761
00:49:52,751 --> 00:49:55,117
he didn't seem
to be too concerned

762
00:49:55,149 --> 00:49:57,353
with being singled out
for questioning.

763
00:49:57,389 --> 00:49:59,112
l think he understood

764
00:49:59,148 --> 00:50:01,930
that his proximity
to the event

765
00:50:01,964 --> 00:50:04,581
was the reason
he was there.

766
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:08,067
But he seemed baffled
by the idea

767
00:50:08,107 --> 00:50:12,196
that we would consider him
an actual suspect.

768
00:50:12,233 --> 00:50:14,120
l found that he was--
if anything,

769
00:50:14,153 --> 00:50:16,094
he was overacting
his innocence.

770
00:50:16,136 --> 00:50:18,045
l didn't believe
a word he said.

771
00:50:21,287 --> 00:50:23,806
After we had just
sort of established

772
00:50:23,846 --> 00:50:26,912
what l took to be the timbre
of the conversation,

773
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:29,819
l went ahead and just sort of
tried to blindside him with that,

774
00:50:29,861 --> 00:50:33,438
and just asked him
as casually as l could,

775
00:50:33,476 --> 00:50:35,842
you know,
''So, you good with guns?''

776
00:50:35,875 --> 00:50:37,915
and he said, ''No.''

777
00:50:37,955 --> 00:50:41,270
and l said,
''You ever used a gun?''

778
00:50:41,313 --> 00:50:44,694
he said, no,
he never had.

779
00:50:44,736 --> 00:50:47,835
and l said,
''Listen, Jamal...

780
00:50:47,872 --> 00:50:49,814
you're not doing yourself
any favors here.

781
00:50:49,855 --> 00:50:53,269
We have photos at your home
of you holding a rifle.''

782
00:50:55,934 --> 00:50:59,381
and he said,
''Oh, that.

783
00:50:59,421 --> 00:51:03,348
That's from my military
service back in Syria.

784
00:51:03,388 --> 00:51:05,274
Everyone had to do it,''

785
00:51:05,307 --> 00:51:08,372
as if, oh, that slipped
his mind.

786
00:51:08,411 --> 00:51:12,185
My impression is
that the Syrian draft

787
00:51:12,218 --> 00:51:16,275
is not something that one
would forget quite so easily.

788
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:30,735
A source with the FBl
here in Chicago tells us

789
00:51:30,772 --> 00:51:34,415
the suspected assassin is,
in fact, a Syrian man--

790
00:51:34,451 --> 00:51:36,012
Jamal Abu Zikri.

791
00:51:36,052 --> 00:51:38,701
We don't know for a fact
where exactly he's being held

792
00:51:38,738 --> 00:51:40,397
at this particular
point in time,

793
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:42,702
but we do know that he has
been taken into custody,

794
00:51:42,737 --> 00:51:45,453
and we have gotten confirmation
that he is of Syrian descent.

795
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:47,211
We also know
that authorities are...

796
00:51:47,248 --> 00:51:49,070
The pressure
on every journalist

797
00:51:49,104 --> 00:51:51,591
to find out just who
the hell they had arrested,

798
00:51:51,631 --> 00:51:55,111
and who the prime suspect was,
was intense.

799
00:51:55,151 --> 00:51:57,037
and l think whoever
ultimately leaked it,

800
00:51:57,070 --> 00:52:00,485
whether it was an FBl guy or a cop
or whoever, l don't know--

801
00:52:00,525 --> 00:52:02,434
whoever leaked it
probably did it

802
00:52:02,477 --> 00:52:05,411
because they were so angry
that Bush had died.

803
00:52:08,491 --> 00:52:11,110
Minutes after it got out
that he was Syrian,

804
00:52:11,147 --> 00:52:15,881
l went into a teleconference
with the ClA director of domestic intel,

805
00:52:15,914 --> 00:52:18,247
and he told me that
Mike Haydon had called.

806
00:52:18,281 --> 00:52:21,989
He wanted an urgent review
of all Syrian intelligence.

807
00:52:22,024 --> 00:52:24,326
He wanted us to take a look
at every Syrian national

808
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:27,805
who'd been back to Damascus
within the last six months.

809
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:30,049
Now, l come out
of this teleconference

810
00:52:30,085 --> 00:52:31,678
and l'm pinching myself

811
00:52:31,717 --> 00:52:34,400
'cause this is not
the way l want to go.

812
00:52:34,436 --> 00:52:36,858
And one of our agents,
Ted Fenzell, runs up to me,

813
00:52:36,899 --> 00:52:40,030
and he says, ''Rob...
the president's on the line.''

814
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:44,475
l'm thinking this is
some kind of a sick joke.

815
00:52:44,514 --> 00:52:46,847
l'm ready to punch him
in the face, and he says to me,

816
00:52:46,881 --> 00:52:50,197
''No, Rob, President Cheney's
on the line.''

817
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,476
And President Cheney says,

818
00:52:52,512 --> 00:52:54,551
''Rob, l know you
got a lot to do,

819
00:52:54,591 --> 00:52:57,045
but take another
look at Assad.

820
00:52:57,087 --> 00:52:59,769
Go over this again.
See if it links to him in any way.''

821
00:52:59,805 --> 00:53:02,391
And l say to him,
''Mr. President,

822
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,112
we have nothing that
points in this direction.

823
00:53:05,149 --> 00:53:07,515
This is just the media
jumping to conclusions.''

824
00:53:07,547 --> 00:53:09,456
And he says,
''l know, l know,

825
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:12,182
but take another
look at it,

826
00:53:12,218 --> 00:53:14,106
and if you see any
obstruction from Damascus,

827
00:53:14,138 --> 00:53:16,112
l want to be
the first to know.''

828
00:53:30,806 --> 00:53:33,456
Publicly, the Syrians were
saying they were cooperating,

829
00:53:33,493 --> 00:53:34,867
they were doing all they could,

830
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,900
but privately they
were stonewalling.

831
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,728
that morning,
l had had a request

832
00:53:39,763 --> 00:53:42,065
for Zikri's military
service detail

833
00:53:42,098 --> 00:53:44,650
flatly refused by the Syrian
Defense Ministry.

834
00:53:44,689 --> 00:53:46,795
Of course, the White House
guys were all over this.

835
00:53:46,834 --> 00:53:48,687
Even Cheney was down
in the weeds on this one.

836
00:53:50,192 --> 00:53:52,395
So when the Syrians
turned down our request,

837
00:53:52,431 --> 00:53:55,398
l knew that they were really
going to feel the heat.

838
00:54:09,195 --> 00:54:11,082
The Secretary has
decided to recall

839
00:54:11,115 --> 00:54:13,153
the US ambassador to Syria,
Margaret Scobie

840
00:54:13,194 --> 00:54:15,081
for urgent consultations

841
00:54:15,114 --> 00:54:17,961
following the brutal murder
of President Bush.

842
00:54:17,993 --> 00:54:21,255
Ambassador Scobie delivered
a message to the Syrian government

843
00:54:21,288 --> 00:54:24,671
expressing our deep concern
as well as our profound outrage

844
00:54:24,712 --> 00:54:26,750
over this heinous
act of terrorism.

845
00:54:26,791 --> 00:54:29,758
President Cheney has
ordered the USS Nimitz

846
00:54:29,798 --> 00:54:31,684
back to the eastern
Mediterranean.

847
00:54:31,718 --> 00:54:33,627
State and Defense
Department officials

848
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:37,312
refused to rule out air strikes against
Damascus. Likely targets include--

849
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:39,836
Joining me now
is Tariq Khoudry,

850
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:41,883
one of the most
outspoken critics

851
00:54:41,923 --> 00:54:43,646
against
the Ba'athist regime

852
00:54:43,682 --> 00:54:45,853
of the Syrian dictator
Bashar Assad.

853
00:54:45,891 --> 00:54:48,541
Mr. Khoudry, are
you not surprised

854
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:51,096
that a Syrian national
may actually have been involved

855
00:54:51,136 --> 00:54:52,762
in this assassination?

856
00:54:52,801 --> 00:54:56,247
Oh, not at all. This is a
state-sponsored assassination--

857
00:54:56,287 --> 00:54:58,709
Syrian state-sponsored
assassination--

858
00:54:58,751 --> 00:55:00,725
just like they did
with Rafiq Al-Hariri,

859
00:55:00,766 --> 00:55:02,195
the prime minister
of Lebanon.

860
00:55:02,238 --> 00:55:03,731
That's a strong
statement, sir.

861
00:55:03,773 --> 00:55:06,807
What kind of specific information
do you have on which to base it?

862
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,884
l've seen official documents
that back this up,

863
00:55:08,924 --> 00:55:11,858
such as the Syrian
intelligence hit list.

864
00:55:11,899 --> 00:55:13,786
And l've seen it
with my own eyes,

865
00:55:13,819 --> 00:55:15,161
and Al-Hariri's name
was there.

866
00:55:15,194 --> 00:55:17,200
A hit list
including politicians

867
00:55:17,242 --> 00:55:19,859
from not only the Middle East
but the United States?

868
00:55:19,896 --> 00:55:21,620
l believe so.

869
00:55:21,656 --> 00:55:24,143
There were many names
beside the Lebanese officials.

870
00:55:24,183 --> 00:55:26,670
There were names
of Sharon,

871
00:55:26,711 --> 00:55:29,198
President Bush,
Vice President Cheney.

872
00:55:29,238 --> 00:55:32,717
And l know this was done with
the blessing of Bashar Al-Assad himself.

873
00:55:32,757 --> 00:55:34,798
He had an agenda.
Everybody knew it.

874
00:55:34,838 --> 00:55:37,837
He would have said that
the Syrian secret service

875
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,981
was responsible
for fixing the Super Bowl

876
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,736
if he thought that that would
get Assad kicked out sooner.

877
00:55:44,531 --> 00:55:46,734
Cheney had been
obsessed with Syria

878
00:55:46,769 --> 00:55:48,625
and getting rid
of Assad for years.

879
00:55:51,217 --> 00:55:53,126
l think that the Syrian
secret service

880
00:55:53,168 --> 00:55:55,307
did assassinate
the Lebanese prime minister.

881
00:55:55,344 --> 00:55:57,547
l don't think there's
much question about that.

882
00:55:57,582 --> 00:55:59,590
But to then say

883
00:55:59,631 --> 00:56:02,827
that they are responsible
for killing Bush, that's quite a leap.

884
00:56:02,862 --> 00:56:04,869
And after a couple of days,

885
00:56:04,909 --> 00:56:07,145
l think Cheney realized
he was never going to sell

886
00:56:07,181 --> 00:56:08,522
the Syrian story to Congress,

887
00:56:08,557 --> 00:56:11,817
so he turned his attention
closer to home.

888
00:56:18,697 --> 00:56:20,999
ln an emergency closed
session this morning,

889
00:56:21,033 --> 00:56:22,756
Congress voted
unanimously

890
00:56:22,792 --> 00:56:26,305
to approve a series of
amendments to the Patriot Act.

891
00:56:26,344 --> 00:56:29,540
President Cheney said the
new measures, dubbed ''Patriot lll,''

892
00:56:29,575 --> 00:56:31,745
will give the FBl
more powers

893
00:56:31,782 --> 00:56:34,629
to predict and prevent
acts of terrorism

894
00:56:34,662 --> 00:56:37,792
and improve security
for federal officials.

895
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:41,283
Patriot lll gave us
better tools

896
00:56:41,316 --> 00:56:43,769
to go after suspected
terrorist organizations,

897
00:56:43,811 --> 00:56:45,698
homegrown radical groups,

898
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:48,479
which might harm
our national interests.

899
00:56:48,513 --> 00:56:51,197
lt broadened the definition
of terrorism.

900
00:56:51,233 --> 00:56:53,916
There are those who would
criticize the Patriot Act.

901
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:57,018
But, frankly, the president of
the United States was assassinated.

902
00:56:57,056 --> 00:56:59,031
So...

903
00:56:59,072 --> 00:57:01,885
in my view we weren't
doing enough.

904
00:57:52,082 --> 00:57:54,502
Fellow citizens,

905
00:57:54,544 --> 00:57:57,130
in this national
vigil of mourning

906
00:57:57,169 --> 00:58:00,233
we show how much America
loved this good man

907
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:03,401
and how greatly
we will miss him.

908
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,543
there was a kindness,
simplicity,

909
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:07,490
and goodness of character

910
00:58:07,533 --> 00:58:09,770
that marked all
the years of his life.

911
00:58:11,052 --> 00:58:13,157
The cheerful spirit
that carried him forward

912
00:58:13,196 --> 00:58:15,399
was more than
a disposition.

913
00:58:15,434 --> 00:58:17,923
lt was the optimism
of a faithful soul

914
00:58:17,963 --> 00:58:20,350
who trusted
in God's purposes

915
00:58:20,393 --> 00:58:23,905
and knew those purposes
to be right and true.

916
00:58:23,945 --> 00:58:27,393
And it was the vision
and the will of George Bush

917
00:58:27,433 --> 00:58:29,320
that gave hope
to the oppressed,

918
00:58:29,352 --> 00:58:31,076
shamed the oppressors,

919
00:58:31,112 --> 00:58:34,307
and overcame evil
with good.

920
00:58:34,342 --> 00:58:36,763
He was a providential man

921
00:58:36,806 --> 00:58:39,260
who came along just when
our nation and the world

922
00:58:39,301 --> 00:58:41,667
most needed him.

923
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,642
Fellow Americans,

924
00:58:43,684 --> 00:58:46,782
here lies a graceful
and a gallant man.

925
00:58:47,907 --> 00:58:49,793
l was honored to be asked

926
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:53,086
to write the eulogy
for President Cheney.

927
00:58:53,121 --> 00:58:54,844
l wanted to convey

928
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,879
President Bush's
moral commitment.

929
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,025
He had...

930
00:59:00,065 --> 00:59:02,746
that power,

931
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:04,606
that strength
of leadership

932
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:07,539
that l believe was
invested in him by God.

933
00:59:31,095 --> 00:59:33,877
We received an anonymous
letter pre-9/11

934
00:59:33,911 --> 00:59:36,212
from someone
in the Bridgeview community,

935
00:59:36,246 --> 00:59:38,667
Chicago's Palestinian
neighborhood.

936
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:42,125
lt suggested that several
members of the local mosque

937
00:59:42,165 --> 00:59:45,742
had attended terrorist
training camps in Afghanistan.

938
00:59:47,219 --> 00:59:49,106
After 9/11,
they were interviewed

939
00:59:49,138 --> 00:59:52,269
and put under intensive
surveillance for two full years.

940
00:59:52,306 --> 00:59:55,469
But all we had were the original
flights to Pakistan.

941
00:59:55,505 --> 00:59:57,392
We could find no proof
that any of them

942
00:59:57,424 --> 01:00:00,173
had ever crossed
into Afghanistan,

943
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:01,931
no evidence
of any kind to suggest

944
01:00:01,968 --> 01:00:03,691
that this was
some kind of a plot,

945
01:00:03,727 --> 01:00:06,279
and nothing to connect either
one of them with Al-Qaeda.

946
01:00:12,557 --> 01:00:15,556
But then, just into the third week
of the investigation,

947
01:00:15,596 --> 01:00:17,482
one of my agents,
Kate Nicholls,

948
01:00:17,515 --> 01:00:20,481
came running down the corridor
with a photograph

949
01:00:20,523 --> 01:00:23,042
from the time of the
Bridgeview investigation.

950
01:00:24,298 --> 01:00:26,184
ln the photograph
was Zikri

951
01:00:26,217 --> 01:00:28,965
with a Yemeni national
named Khaled Leqawi

952
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,455
who we believe was in Chicago
on a recruiting mission

953
01:00:31,496 --> 01:00:33,699
in the spring of 2001.

954
01:00:33,735 --> 01:00:35,524
And, sure enough,

955
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:37,597
Zikri was on a plane
to Pakistan

956
01:00:37,637 --> 01:00:39,393
in April of 2001.

957
01:01:23,067 --> 01:01:25,433
ln the second week
of questioning,

958
01:01:25,466 --> 01:01:27,537
l mentioned Leqawi,

959
01:01:27,577 --> 01:01:29,464
and... he gave me

960
01:01:29,496 --> 01:01:32,626
that same stonewall,
blank shrug.

961
01:01:32,664 --> 01:01:35,282
Didn't know the man,
wasn't familiar with the name.

962
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,206
l pressed harder.
''Leqawi--

963
01:01:37,239 --> 01:01:39,475
you're sure you don't
know that name?''

964
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:41,997
''No, never heard
it before.''

965
01:01:42,037 --> 01:01:44,557
Then l showed him
the photograph,

966
01:01:44,596 --> 01:01:46,865
and...

967
01:01:46,901 --> 01:01:49,004
he froze a moment.

968
01:01:49,043 --> 01:01:51,083
and then there was this...

969
01:01:51,123 --> 01:01:54,799
sudden collapse
of confidence.

970
01:01:56,274 --> 01:01:58,411
l said,
''Listen, Jamal...

971
01:01:59,856 --> 01:02:02,703
l know you were
in Afghanistan, you know?

972
01:02:02,736 --> 01:02:04,678
l just want you
to tell us.''

973
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,818
And he sat there
for a moment,

974
01:02:07,855 --> 01:02:10,701
perhaps considering
his options,

975
01:02:10,734 --> 01:02:13,580
and then he said,
''Okay.

976
01:02:13,613 --> 01:02:15,522
All right,
l was there.''

977
01:03:25,307 --> 01:03:27,194
l first heard from a guy

978
01:03:27,227 --> 01:03:29,811
in the Trace and Fiber
Department down the hall,

979
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:31,824
and they had found

980
01:03:31,865 --> 01:03:35,574
gunshot residue
on his jacket.

981
01:03:35,608 --> 01:03:39,666
Gunshot residue
is what we call...

982
01:03:41,014 --> 01:03:42,988
associative evidence.

983
01:03:43,030 --> 01:03:44,917
lt's not
discriminating evidence,

984
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:47,218
meaning that it's...

985
01:03:47,253 --> 01:03:50,863
you can't really
convict somebody of...

986
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:54,445
firing a gun
based on gunshot residue.

987
01:03:54,483 --> 01:03:56,392
lt's only
sort of a backup.

988
01:03:57,777 --> 01:04:00,527
And then, it got
to my department,

989
01:04:00,562 --> 01:04:02,448
and a colleague of mine

990
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,521
said he had a match,
a fingerprint match.

991
01:04:04,561 --> 01:04:06,764
and what he had
was a partial print

992
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:08,687
from the crime scene.

993
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:10,693
and... he found

994
01:04:10,734 --> 01:04:12,622
nine points of comparison

995
01:04:12,654 --> 01:04:14,824
to Zikri's print
from the database.

996
01:04:14,861 --> 01:04:18,178
So l thought
it was promising,

997
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:21,068
but not
the sure-fire evidence

998
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:23,074
that we needed.

999
01:04:23,115 --> 01:04:25,057
lt was...

1000
01:04:25,099 --> 01:04:26,986
nine points
of comparison.

1001
01:04:27,018 --> 01:04:28,807
Uh...

1002
01:04:28,842 --> 01:04:31,525
people have been
convicted on less.

1003
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,450
The Attorney General's
office in D.C. was ready

1004
01:04:40,486 --> 01:04:43,519
to charge Zikri as soon as they
heard about the trip to Afghanistan.

1005
01:04:43,558 --> 01:04:47,649
So when the forensics evidence
came in, that was it.

1006
01:04:47,686 --> 01:04:50,435
There were still other
lines of inquiry, yeah,

1007
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:52,355
other suspects that
we were following up,

1008
01:04:52,387 --> 01:04:54,592
but they immediately
diminished in importance

1009
01:04:54,627 --> 01:04:57,047
in the face of such
compelling forensic evidence.

1010
01:05:07,488 --> 01:05:09,691
Earlier today,

1011
01:05:09,727 --> 01:05:11,833
an indictment was unsealed
in Federal Court

1012
01:05:11,871 --> 01:05:13,910
in the Northern
District of lllinois,

1013
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:15,925
charging
Jamal Abu Zikri

1014
01:05:15,966 --> 01:05:17,143
with the assassination

1015
01:05:17,181 --> 01:05:20,923
of the president of the United States
with a rifle.

1016
01:05:20,956 --> 01:05:23,127
As outlined
in the indictment,

1017
01:05:23,164 --> 01:05:26,905
Mr. Zikri took part in Al-Qaeda
training in Afghanistan,

1018
01:05:26,939 --> 01:05:30,004
and conspired with others
to commit this brutal act.

1019
01:05:34,457 --> 01:05:36,561
This case is being
brought in part

1020
01:05:36,601 --> 01:05:38,967
because prosecutors
and law enforcement agents

1021
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,366
were able to share
information

1022
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,341
from a multiagency
investigation

1023
01:05:43,382 --> 01:05:46,698
under the provisions
of the USA Patriot Act.

1024
01:05:49,781 --> 01:05:52,628
The link between
Jamal Abu Zikri and Al-Qaeda

1025
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:56,337
shows once again
the nature of the enemy

1026
01:05:56,371 --> 01:05:58,891
that we're facing
in the War on Terror.

1027
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:02,475
The last thing we need
is to convey the impression

1028
01:06:02,514 --> 01:06:04,783
that terrorists
can change our policies

1029
01:06:04,817 --> 01:06:06,857
through violence
and intimidation,

1030
01:06:06,897 --> 01:06:10,158
that they can force the government
of the United States to change course

1031
01:06:10,192 --> 01:06:12,101
if they inflict
enough violence.

1032
01:06:39,239 --> 01:06:42,305
The FBl was desperate
to link Zikri with others

1033
01:06:42,343 --> 01:06:45,724
because it was an embarrassment
for them if they couldn't link him.

1034
01:06:45,765 --> 01:06:48,188
lf they couldn't make it
part of a conspiracy,

1035
01:06:48,231 --> 01:06:51,808
then it was more difficult to prove
the terrorism motive,

1036
01:06:51,845 --> 01:06:54,233
which they deeply
needed to do.

1037
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:57,145
Even if my client
had been to Afghanistan,

1038
01:06:57,187 --> 01:07:00,569
it may not be irrelevant, but it's
certainly not material.

1039
01:07:00,611 --> 01:07:04,057
What it was really useful for
was to propel forward

1040
01:07:04,097 --> 01:07:05,984
this conveyor belt
of terrorism

1041
01:07:06,016 --> 01:07:08,286
that they needed
to convince people

1042
01:07:08,321 --> 01:07:10,873
that this was the motive
for the case.

1043
01:07:10,911 --> 01:07:13,661
l think the weight
they gave it

1044
01:07:13,695 --> 01:07:16,727
is testimony itself to how weak
the forensic case was.

1045
01:07:35,769 --> 01:07:38,071
Gunshot residue is
notoriously unreliable.

1046
01:07:38,105 --> 01:07:39,348
And, in fact,

1047
01:07:39,384 --> 01:07:42,613
the prosecution
witnesses admitted

1048
01:07:42,648 --> 01:07:46,029
that the GSR that was found
on Jamal's jacket

1049
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:47,793
could have been
contamination--

1050
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:50,318
someone else could
have picked it up.

1051
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:52,910
lt's very easy
to contaminate

1052
01:07:52,948 --> 01:07:55,152
gunshot residue evidence.

1053
01:07:55,188 --> 01:07:57,075
That means
that the whole case

1054
01:07:57,107 --> 01:07:59,595
boiled down
to one partial print.

1055
01:08:34,890 --> 01:08:36,962
Madam Foreperson,
has the jury reached

1056
01:08:37,002 --> 01:08:39,139
a unanimous verdict
on the case presented to you?

1057
01:08:39,177 --> 01:08:40,638
Yes.

1058
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:43,330
Have you signed
and printed your names?

1059
01:08:43,368 --> 01:08:44,993
Yes.

1060
01:08:45,031 --> 01:08:47,551
All right, if you will give
the sheet to the bailiff.

1061
01:09:04,226 --> 01:09:07,837
Ms. Clerk, if you will read
the verdict, please.

1062
01:09:11,264 --> 01:09:14,744
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
you have returned the following verdict:

1063
01:09:14,784 --> 01:09:17,782
''The people of the United
States of America

1064
01:09:17,823 --> 01:09:20,691
versus Jamal
Mohammed Abu Zikri,

1065
01:09:20,733 --> 01:09:24,693
file number 02CRS281.

1066
01:09:25,821 --> 01:09:27,959
We, the 1 2 members
of the jury,

1067
01:09:27,996 --> 01:09:30,298
unanimously find
the defendant

1068
01:09:30,331 --> 01:09:32,218
guilty of
the assassination

1069
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:34,836
of President
George Walker Bush,

1070
01:09:34,874 --> 01:09:39,063
with a rifle, this the
10th day of May 2008.''

1071
01:09:39,097 --> 01:09:42,926
Signed by the foreperson,
Cheryl Jones.

1072
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:49,140
ls this your verdict,
so say you all?

1073
01:09:50,230 --> 01:09:52,052
Yes.

1074
01:09:56,244 --> 01:09:59,145
Jamal is devastated by the
outcome of this trial

1075
01:09:59,187 --> 01:10:01,642
and obviously we're all
dismayed by the verdict.

1076
01:10:01,683 --> 01:10:03,625
But he wants
to continue to fight.

1077
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:07,310
And so, on Monday, l will be filing
an appeal on behalf of my client.

1078
01:10:13,328 --> 01:10:16,327
My client's destiny
in this case

1079
01:10:16,367 --> 01:10:19,268
was sealed from the minute
that Brock stood up

1080
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:21,515
at that DOJ
press conference in October

1081
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:24,810
and said the words,
''Al-Qaeda assassin,''

1082
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:26,567
and they knew that.

1083
01:10:26,604 --> 01:10:29,353
l mean, Al-Qaeda
equals guilty.

1084
01:10:29,389 --> 01:10:32,802
And there was not one
citizen in this country

1085
01:10:32,843 --> 01:10:34,730
that was going to

1086
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:37,894
come to the proceedings

1087
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:40,384
with an open mind
after that.

1088
01:10:40,426 --> 01:10:42,564
l mean, they knew
what they were doing.

1089
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:48,224
Juries love
forensic evidence,

1090
01:10:48,263 --> 01:10:50,402
and it's popularly
believed to be

1091
01:10:50,439 --> 01:10:52,740
100o/ accurate

1092
01:10:52,773 --> 01:10:54,748
and free of bias.

1093
01:10:54,789 --> 01:10:56,893
People lie.
Everyone knows that.

1094
01:10:56,933 --> 01:10:58,820
But a fingerprint match

1095
01:10:58,853 --> 01:11:01,154
is a great
silent witness.

1096
01:11:01,188 --> 01:11:03,042
lt's...
it's definitive.

1097
01:11:03,075 --> 01:11:05,049
The reality

1098
01:11:05,091 --> 01:11:07,424
is a little different.

1099
01:11:07,459 --> 01:11:10,141
there isn't a forensics
examiner in history

1100
01:11:10,177 --> 01:11:12,543
who hasn't somehow
been compromised

1101
01:11:12,577 --> 01:11:16,252
by that pressure
to get results.

1102
01:11:16,287 --> 01:11:18,557
They seemed to be working
backwards in this case.

1103
01:11:18,591 --> 01:11:20,478
They had a hypothesis
of guilt,

1104
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:23,642
and then they tried to fit
the evidence to prove that.

1105
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:25,434
And that's not science.

1106
01:11:27,101 --> 01:11:30,167
l did my own analysis of
the print from the crime scene.

1107
01:11:30,204 --> 01:11:32,243
l did it
several times.

1108
01:11:32,284 --> 01:11:34,901
And it was reasonable,

1109
01:11:34,939 --> 01:11:38,899
but reasonable isn't
good enough in this situation.

1110
01:11:38,937 --> 01:11:41,620
l was told
that this case was

1111
01:11:41,657 --> 01:11:43,927
too big to...

1112
01:11:43,961 --> 01:11:45,847
leave unsolved
in the lab,

1113
01:11:45,879 --> 01:11:48,782
and too big
to lose in court,

1114
01:11:48,824 --> 01:11:51,506
and that basically
l should...

1115
01:11:51,543 --> 01:11:53,963
put up or shut up.

1116
01:11:54,006 --> 01:11:56,559
My skepticism and...

1117
01:11:56,598 --> 01:11:58,484
objectivity
wasn't needed,

1118
01:11:58,517 --> 01:12:00,753
it wasn't helping.

1119
01:12:00,788 --> 01:12:04,748
And that's what made
my position untenable.

1120
01:12:04,787 --> 01:12:07,056
l resigned under protest

1121
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:10,570
because l couldn't do
my job properly.

1122
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,141
Right up to the start
of the trial, we had

1123
01:12:16,176 --> 01:12:18,858
over 300 investigators trying
to identify, or find a link to,

1124
01:12:18,895 --> 01:12:20,782
any fellow
coconspirators.

1125
01:12:20,815 --> 01:12:22,790
We didn't find
any evidence

1126
01:12:22,831 --> 01:12:25,284
that he'd ever planned
to do anything,

1127
01:12:25,326 --> 01:12:28,172
commit any acts of terrorism
when he got back from Afghanistan.

1128
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:32,521
At the time, politically,
it was very difficult

1129
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:34,977
for anyone in the agency
or the administration

1130
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:37,888
to accept that Zikri
had acted alone,

1131
01:12:37,931 --> 01:12:40,068
that...

1132
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:43,520
any one man could have planned
and carried out this assassination.

1133
01:12:43,561 --> 01:12:45,666
But...

1134
01:12:45,705 --> 01:12:49,217
that was when we still believed
that Zikri was the assassin.

1135
01:13:18,816 --> 01:13:21,662
Here in Rock lsland,
there's not a person

1136
01:13:21,694 --> 01:13:25,273
that doesn't have
some connection to the war,

1137
01:13:25,311 --> 01:13:27,415
that doesn't have somebody
in active service--

1138
01:13:27,454 --> 01:13:30,322
A father,
son, daughter.

1139
01:13:30,365 --> 01:13:32,569
So when our boys
go off to war,

1140
01:13:32,605 --> 01:13:35,603
they know that they
have our support.

1141
01:13:35,643 --> 01:13:39,025
My father was
in the Army.

1142
01:13:39,067 --> 01:13:41,074
l'm considered
an Army brat.

1143
01:13:41,115 --> 01:13:43,088
My...

1144
01:13:43,129 --> 01:13:45,431
and l married...

1145
01:13:45,466 --> 01:13:47,570
a man that my father
would be proud of.

1146
01:13:50,424 --> 01:13:53,357
He served in the first
Gulf War, Desert Storm.

1147
01:13:53,399 --> 01:13:55,439
Was a decorated major.

1148
01:13:55,478 --> 01:13:58,860
And my sons followed
in their father's footsteps.

1149
01:14:00,884 --> 01:14:03,731
Of course
a parent worries.

1150
01:14:03,764 --> 01:14:05,486
Who wouldn't?

1151
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:08,838
But it was the best thing
that happened to Casey.

1152
01:14:08,883 --> 01:14:11,152
He was going
down the wrong path,

1153
01:14:11,186 --> 01:14:13,193
experimenting with drugs,

1154
01:14:13,234 --> 01:14:15,818
and... the Army
whipped him into shape.

1155
01:14:18,705 --> 01:14:20,744
l'm proud of my son.

1156
01:14:20,783 --> 01:14:22,725
l'm proud that he did

1157
01:14:22,767 --> 01:14:25,865
what was needed
to protect us.

1158
01:14:25,902 --> 01:14:29,578
He had the guts and
the courage to serve his country.

1159
01:14:34,476 --> 01:14:37,736
My experience in lraq
was slaughter.

1160
01:14:37,771 --> 01:14:40,706
We were fighting arrows
with guns over there.

1161
01:14:49,896 --> 01:14:51,903
Once you take a life...

1162
01:14:53,639 --> 01:14:56,224
you know, you lose
a piece of yourself.

1163
01:14:57,733 --> 01:15:00,963
You're basically just sitting
around waiting for your turn.

1164
01:15:04,645 --> 01:15:07,992
When we left, we thought we was
going over there because of 9/11,

1165
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:11,809
and to look for these weapons of
mass destruction, which we never found.

1166
01:15:13,313 --> 01:15:16,281
You know, so we had to tell
ourselves something--

1167
01:15:16,322 --> 01:15:18,459
we were fighting
for freedom,

1168
01:15:18,497 --> 01:15:20,439
freedom of
the lraqi people.

1169
01:15:23,839 --> 01:15:26,489
lt was obvious that they
didn't want us there.

1170
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:30,169
No, they didn't
want us there at all.

1171
01:15:43,577 --> 01:15:47,221
Casey had just gotten
back from his tour,

1172
01:15:47,258 --> 01:15:50,071
and... That's when we got

1173
01:15:50,104 --> 01:15:51,859
our knock on the door--

1174
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:58,894
that David had...

1175
01:15:58,934 --> 01:16:01,683
been hit
by a roadside bomb

1176
01:16:01,717 --> 01:16:03,888
just outside of Mosul.

1177
01:16:08,724 --> 01:16:11,724
They said his Humvee
turned over...

1178
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:15,629
and...

1179
01:16:15,666 --> 01:16:17,552
that was it.

1180
01:16:19,888 --> 01:16:22,757
lt's the hardest thing
l'd ever dealt with.

1181
01:16:25,488 --> 01:16:27,374
We all dealt with it
in our own way.

1182
01:16:27,407 --> 01:16:29,773
My husband and l
tried to...

1183
01:16:29,805 --> 01:16:32,707
tried to console each other
and be there for each other.

1184
01:16:32,749 --> 01:16:35,083
Casey just went off
to himself.

1185
01:16:40,524 --> 01:16:44,036
l wanted him to come home
so we could take care of him,

1186
01:16:44,075 --> 01:16:46,975
because l was not
going to lose Casey

1187
01:16:47,017 --> 01:16:48,806
like l--

1188
01:16:48,841 --> 01:16:50,912
like l lost David.

1189
01:16:54,407 --> 01:16:57,985
My husband Al woke up
early that morning,

1190
01:16:58,024 --> 01:17:00,892
told me he was going
to Chicago to bring Casey back.

1191
01:17:02,342 --> 01:17:04,959
Casey said he was
in Chicago looking for work,

1192
01:17:04,997 --> 01:17:08,291
but l knew he'd
gone back on drugs.

1193
01:17:09,956 --> 01:17:12,737
l knew the president was
going to be visiting that night,

1194
01:17:12,771 --> 01:17:16,480
but l didn't know anything about
any protesters or anything like that.

1195
01:17:16,513 --> 01:17:19,263
l knew Casey didn't--
wouldn't have anything to do

1196
01:17:19,297 --> 01:17:22,875
with any Cindy Sheehan
kind of protesting,

1197
01:17:22,913 --> 01:17:24,799
or anything
like that going on.

1198
01:17:24,831 --> 01:17:26,904
He didn't believe in it.

1199
01:17:31,294 --> 01:17:34,806
l'd heard on the news
that Bush had been shot.

1200
01:17:34,845 --> 01:17:37,211
My heart just...

1201
01:17:37,244 --> 01:17:39,928
dropped...

1202
01:17:39,964 --> 01:17:42,930
and all l could do
was pray.

1203
01:17:42,971 --> 01:17:45,872
l was trying to call
my husband on his cell phone,

1204
01:17:45,913 --> 01:17:49,109
but l never got
an answer.

1205
01:17:49,145 --> 01:17:52,440
l just wanted to know
that our son was okay.

1206
01:17:56,727 --> 01:17:59,890
l was upset when
l was locked up,

1207
01:17:59,926 --> 01:18:01,900
but it kind of ended up
being a good thing.

1208
01:18:01,942 --> 01:18:04,210
lt was a wake-up
call for me.

1209
01:18:04,246 --> 01:18:06,547
Made me realize, like...

1210
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:08,947
l had to get my shit together
'cause this wasn't me.

1211
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:11,532
Everything that was going on
in my life, that wasn't me.

1212
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:15,505
l was sitting
in the room by myself,

1213
01:18:15,539 --> 01:18:18,407
and they came in that morning
and told me l could go.

1214
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:22,029
First thing l did was

1215
01:18:22,066 --> 01:18:24,519
l went to a phone
and called my mom.

1216
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,446
She was crying
like crazy.

1217
01:18:26,479 --> 01:18:28,934
l didn't really understand
at first what was going on.

1218
01:18:28,975 --> 01:18:31,657
l thought maybe she had
heard that l was...

1219
01:18:31,694 --> 01:18:33,549
you know, locked up.

1220
01:18:33,582 --> 01:18:36,102
Maybe she was scared
for me or something.

1221
01:18:36,141 --> 01:18:38,029
Or l thought
she was upset by,

1222
01:18:38,061 --> 01:18:40,907
you know, what happened
to the president.

1223
01:18:42,316 --> 01:18:44,486
Then l realized
it was my father.

1224
01:18:51,177 --> 01:18:53,151
l found out
that morning...

1225
01:18:54,344 --> 01:18:56,286
some people
walking their dogs

1226
01:18:56,328 --> 01:18:59,261
found my father
in his car.

1227
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:10,243
Felt like somebody's just,
like, ripped my heart out.

1228
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:15,459
There was so much shit
l wanted to say to him, you know?

1229
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:22,049
My dad had been sick
for a long time--

1230
01:19:22,081 --> 01:19:24,764
for a long time, at least since
he had got back from the--

1231
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,939
You know,
from the Gulf War,

1232
01:19:26,976 --> 01:19:28,982
when l was
a little kid.

1233
01:19:29,022 --> 01:19:30,910
Then what happened
to David,

1234
01:19:30,943 --> 01:19:33,308
that just pushed him
right on over the edge.

1235
01:19:33,342 --> 01:19:35,284
'Cause he never
talked about David.

1236
01:19:35,325 --> 01:19:38,106
He never once
mentioned David.

1237
01:19:39,517 --> 01:19:41,272
He left me a note.

1238
01:19:42,651 --> 01:19:44,724
They gave me a copy.

1239
01:19:49,371 --> 01:19:52,566
He said,
''Everything l stood for

1240
01:19:52,601 --> 01:19:55,731
and raised you to stand for
has turned bad.

1241
01:19:58,231 --> 01:20:01,526
There is no honor in dying
for an immoral cause...

1242
01:20:02,839 --> 01:20:04,693
for lies.

1243
01:20:08,917 --> 01:20:11,785
l love my country
but l love God...

1244
01:20:14,036 --> 01:20:16,751
and the sons
he gave me even more.

1245
01:20:19,762 --> 01:20:22,860
l must do the right thing
by you and by David.

1246
01:20:26,481 --> 01:20:29,644
George Bush
killed our David,

1247
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:32,395
and l cannot
forgive him for that.''

1248
01:20:35,086 --> 01:20:37,190
l never read it.

1249
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:41,409
The man who wrote that note
was not my husband.

1250
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:45,674
That was an act
of a desperate man...

1251
01:20:48,012 --> 01:20:50,913
who felt helpless,
who felt powerless.

1252
01:20:53,897 --> 01:20:55,784
They told me,

1253
01:20:55,818 --> 01:20:58,533
''Don't worry, son.

1254
01:20:58,568 --> 01:21:00,456
We know it's not
your father.

1255
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:02,375
We already have
the guy who...

1256
01:21:02,407 --> 01:21:04,317
who did it.
He's Al-Qaeda.''

1257
01:21:08,294 --> 01:21:10,180
Casey Claybon
was described

1258
01:21:10,213 --> 01:21:13,311
as a very troubled
lraq War vet

1259
01:21:13,347 --> 01:21:16,315
who probably had P.T.S.D.,

1260
01:21:16,356 --> 01:21:18,809
who had a long history
of drug use.

1261
01:21:18,850 --> 01:21:21,916
And there were a couple of paragraphs
on the third or the fourth page

1262
01:21:21,954 --> 01:21:25,118
of the ''Chicago Sun-Times,''
and then that was it.

1263
01:21:26,112 --> 01:21:27,934
lt all kind
of got buried

1264
01:21:27,968 --> 01:21:30,268
with all of the talk
of Syria and Al-Qaeda,

1265
01:21:30,303 --> 01:21:32,856
and it just kind of got
swept under the rug.

1266
01:21:32,896 --> 01:21:35,033
And by then,
we were into the trial.

1267
01:21:40,701 --> 01:21:43,066
You have to understand
the context.

1268
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:45,010
Casey Claybon was not
the only person

1269
01:21:45,052 --> 01:21:47,668
trying to tell us
who killed the president.

1270
01:21:47,708 --> 01:21:51,415
The United States is the home
of the conspiracy theorist.

1271
01:21:51,451 --> 01:21:55,343
We received literally thousands
of tips from within the US.

1272
01:21:55,385 --> 01:21:57,327
We investigated...

1273
01:21:57,369 --> 01:21:59,822
radical environmentalists,
pro-choice groups,

1274
01:21:59,863 --> 01:22:02,766
the Revolutionary
Communist Party of America.

1275
01:22:02,808 --> 01:22:05,425
Virtually every
radical lslamic group

1276
01:22:05,463 --> 01:22:09,422
was posting claims
of responsibility on their websites,

1277
01:22:09,461 --> 01:22:13,421
not to mention all the Bush-hating
lunatics who were out that day.

1278
01:22:15,252 --> 01:22:17,618
We even had a white
supremacist from Alabama

1279
01:22:17,652 --> 01:22:19,539
who tried to claim
responsibility for it.

1280
01:22:19,571 --> 01:22:22,287
Turns out he wasn't
even in Chicago that day.

1281
01:22:27,089 --> 01:22:29,193
lt's true that we
didn't prioritize

1282
01:22:29,232 --> 01:22:31,851
Aloysius Claybon
as a potential suspect.

1283
01:22:31,888 --> 01:22:34,822
But in any investigation you have
to look at what's in front of you

1284
01:22:34,863 --> 01:22:37,612
and decide where
to direct your resources.

1285
01:22:37,646 --> 01:22:39,850
By the time we
found Claybon,

1286
01:22:39,886 --> 01:22:41,990
Zikri was already
in custody,

1287
01:22:42,028 --> 01:22:44,069
a guy who'd
basically admitted

1288
01:22:44,109 --> 01:22:47,686
that he had provided
material support for terrorism.

1289
01:22:47,724 --> 01:22:49,545
He fit the profile.

1290
01:22:49,578 --> 01:22:51,466
There was compelling
forensic evidence

1291
01:22:51,499 --> 01:22:53,386
linking him
to the crime scene.

1292
01:22:53,419 --> 01:22:55,872
And l'm fairly confident
that any other investigator

1293
01:22:55,914 --> 01:22:58,181
would have drawn
the same conclusions.

1294
01:23:12,005 --> 01:23:14,110
On July 4th,
l received a phone call

1295
01:23:14,149 --> 01:23:17,661
from a special agent from the
lllinois State Police.

1296
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:20,383
He told me that
Casey had found,

1297
01:23:20,419 --> 01:23:23,101
amongst his father's
belongings,

1298
01:23:23,138 --> 01:23:25,025
a detailed map
of downtown Chicago

1299
01:23:25,057 --> 01:23:27,129
marked up military-style.

1300
01:23:29,057 --> 01:23:31,160
He read for me

1301
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,469
one specific paper

1302
01:23:33,503 --> 01:23:35,641
that he'd found
amongst Aloysius's things.

1303
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:37,588
And l recall, as he...

1304
01:23:39,358 --> 01:23:41,299
read it to me, l started
to get a sick feeling

1305
01:23:41,341 --> 01:23:43,251
in the pit
of my stomach.

1306
01:23:44,285 --> 01:23:46,139
Basically,

1307
01:23:46,172 --> 01:23:49,487
the document that Aloysius
had was a survey report.

1308
01:23:50,779 --> 01:23:52,785
lt detailed the exact
motorcade route,

1309
01:23:52,826 --> 01:23:55,826
all the president's movements
and security arrangements that day.

1310
01:23:55,867 --> 01:23:57,589
So it was like,

1311
01:23:57,626 --> 01:23:59,894
''Trailblazer
onstage at 19:15.

1312
01:23:59,929 --> 01:24:02,830
Trailblazer exits Sheraton
west entrance at 20:10,''

1313
01:24:02,872 --> 01:24:04,781
and so on.

1314
01:24:13,364 --> 01:24:15,951
The minute l read
the note he left me,

1315
01:24:15,989 --> 01:24:18,127
l knew my father
had killed bush.

1316
01:24:18,164 --> 01:24:20,051
l knew it.

1317
01:24:20,083 --> 01:24:23,279
Then when l found the map, l thought
people would finally listen to me,

1318
01:24:23,315 --> 01:24:25,420
and l had to
tell the truth.

1319
01:24:25,458 --> 01:24:27,879
That's what
my father stood for--

1320
01:24:27,921 --> 01:24:30,823
truth and honesty.

1321
01:24:30,865 --> 01:24:32,904
You know, to try
to do the right thing.

1322
01:24:32,945 --> 01:24:35,627
And l felt like this was
the right thing to do,

1323
01:24:35,663 --> 01:24:39,307
even though l know it would
cut right through my mom.

1324
01:24:41,102 --> 01:24:44,679
l knew the man they had
convicted was innocent,

1325
01:24:44,716 --> 01:24:46,690
so l had to do it.

1326
01:24:52,107 --> 01:24:54,756
Aloysius Claybon knew
where the Secret Service

1327
01:24:54,795 --> 01:24:57,925
was deployed. He knew
the entrances, the exits.

1328
01:24:57,962 --> 01:25:00,481
He could work out
where Bush was exposed,

1329
01:25:00,522 --> 01:25:03,203
and therefore where
the vantage point would be.

1330
01:25:18,053 --> 01:25:20,418
For a long time we
were unable to identify

1331
01:25:20,452 --> 01:25:23,713
the man seen crossing
the service area beneath 422.

1332
01:25:23,747 --> 01:25:26,202
Now we believe
the identity of this male

1333
01:25:26,242 --> 01:25:28,794
is probably
Aloysius Claybon.

1334
01:25:32,481 --> 01:25:35,644
Now the survey report is not something
that many people get to see.

1335
01:25:36,863 --> 01:25:39,165
There were 107
administration officials

1336
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:41,238
or Secret Service
personnel,

1337
01:25:41,278 --> 01:25:43,220
who either saw it
or had access to it

1338
01:25:43,261 --> 01:25:45,627
up to 10 days
ahead of the visit.

1339
01:25:45,661 --> 01:25:47,865
We have interviewed
every individual

1340
01:25:47,901 --> 01:25:49,787
with access
to this schedule.

1341
01:25:49,821 --> 01:25:51,707
Finding the source
of the leak

1342
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:54,390
is the focus of a massive
investigation.

1343
01:25:56,283 --> 01:25:59,151
ln my opinion, someone
leaked it to the protest community,

1344
01:25:59,193 --> 01:26:00,982
including Molini,

1345
01:26:01,017 --> 01:26:04,365
and someone from there
passed it on to Al Claybon.

1346
01:26:06,455 --> 01:26:09,716
People have said that the hatred
on display that day

1347
01:26:09,752 --> 01:26:13,329
somehow gave the killer
license to shoot Bush.

1348
01:26:13,367 --> 01:26:15,854
That's not really
for me to comment on.

1349
01:26:15,893 --> 01:26:18,445
What l'm interested in
as a federal investigator

1350
01:26:18,484 --> 01:26:20,623
is finding exactly
who furnished the killer

1351
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:23,921
with the information that allowed him
to commit this crime.

1352
01:26:25,971 --> 01:26:28,010
Under the powers
afforded us by Patriot lll,

1353
01:26:28,050 --> 01:26:29,938
we have kept
a constant scrutiny

1354
01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:32,871
of e-mail traffic
and telephone communications

1355
01:26:32,913 --> 01:26:35,368
of every protest group
in relation to this matter.

1356
01:26:35,408 --> 01:26:39,083
And l remain confident that we
will find the persons involved.

1357
01:26:46,509 --> 01:26:48,581
l think maybe
because Al's dead

1358
01:26:48,621 --> 01:26:51,849
the authorities have just felt
they can sit on the Zikri appeal.

1359
01:26:51,883 --> 01:26:53,771
l mean,
let's face it--

1360
01:26:53,803 --> 01:26:56,705
They were unable to link
Zikri to any accomplices.

1361
01:26:56,747 --> 01:26:59,649
All they had on him
was that he had traveled

1362
01:26:59,690 --> 01:27:03,464
and taken some vacations
to exotic locales,

1363
01:27:03,497 --> 01:27:05,471
and had attended
the wrong summer camp.

1364
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:07,651
But as far as most people
are concerned,

1365
01:27:07,688 --> 01:27:11,200
either he's still guilty, or, if not,
he at least flirted with terrorism.

1366
01:27:11,239 --> 01:27:13,628
So who cares
if he's locked up?

1367
01:28:16,982 --> 01:28:19,533
My dad, he lived
for the Army.

1368
