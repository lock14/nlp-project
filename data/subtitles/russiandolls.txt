a TAKESHI KITANO film

4
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,100
We re ready.

5
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,700
It's time. Here goes.

6
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:37,400
"I beg you. Calm thyself.
Rashness will come to no good."

7
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,300
"Thou hast become enslaved

8
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:56,100
to such a miserable state of mind."

9
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,400
"Who hast led thee to such a state?"

10
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:17,800
"God have mercy. It Is none other than I."

11
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:25,500
"I, Umekawa, is all to be blamed."

12
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:34,100
"Shall I be thankful to thee?"

13
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:42,200
"Or shall I pity thee?"

14
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:09,100
"Read thou my heart." She beguiled him.

15
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:19,600
The tears she shed
fell on the gold coins.

16
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:28,600
And her tears shone like globeflowers

17
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,300
covered by dew.

18
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:38,700
It was indeed a sight,
which drew forth

19
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:54,800
pity from one's heart.

20
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,000
All the gold Chubei spent

21
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,000
was not his to possess.

22
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,500
Thus, glory was ephemeral.

23
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,400
A way they fled

24
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:44,200
to yonder and beyond
where their feet guided them.

The leashed beggars.

33
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,100
Leashed beggars!

34
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,100
Well, hello.

35
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,900
Hi.

36
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,700
So, Matsumoto's bride isn't Sawako.

37
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,700
Evidently not.

38
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,100
When I got the invitation,
I thought they finally got hitched

39
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,800
but I was wrong.

40
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,800
He's marrying
our company president s daughter.

41
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,800
You're kidding.

42
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,500
The family seems to like him.

43
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,500
So, he's a Cinderella boy.

44
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,500
He's now a way ahead of us.

45
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,300
Whatever happened to Sawako?

46
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,300
Must have broken up nicely.

47
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Never thought Matsumoto was such a guy.

48
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,100
Why not take the opportunity?

49
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,300
Yeah, the shortcut to success.

50
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,000
In 2 years, we'll have to
speak politely to him.

51
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,800
The president is kind enough to...

52
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,900
I'm already engaged.

53
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,700
Forget her. You re not married yet.

54
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,500
Think about your life.

55
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,400
Your father worked hard,

56
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,400
but with little success,
because he's not a college graduate.

57
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,400
Why do you think
he made you go to college?

58
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,100
Think it over.

59
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,900
It s about your life.

60
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,000
This is a great opportunity.

61
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,900
You must know that.

62
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,500
I can't leave her.

63
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,300
We II go and apologize to her.

64
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,100
We'll beg her... do anything.

65
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,200
What?

66
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,600
Congratulations.

67
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,200
I'm happy for you.

68
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,100
Excuse me, sir.

69
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,600
You have a visitor.
She says she's Sawako's friend.

70
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,800
Hey.

71
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,900
What's up?

72
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,400
An old friend's here.

73
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,800
Forgot to invite him.

74
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,300
I see.

75
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,300
So, you chose success?

76
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,900
Sawako chose suicide.

77
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,100
She died?

78
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,700
No, she survived, but not completely.

79
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,600
She lost her sanity.

80
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,700
Doesn't even recognize me.

81
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,500
She s as good as dead.

82
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,200
Where is she now?

83
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,400
Hospital.

84
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Which one?

85
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,500
She won't recognize you.

86
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,100
Sawako chose suicide.

87
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,900
She won't recognize you.

88
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,500
It's delicious.

89
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,100
You can have more.

90
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,300
Whatever happened to him?

91
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,000
Heard he took off.

92
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,100
What about the wedding?

93
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,600
I guess it’ll be cancelled.

94
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,900
Okay, collect the trash.

95
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,700
Put the trash in here. Okay.

96
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,300
Still some over there.

97
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:13,000
Why the hell did you
take off from the wedding?

98
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,700
The bride was in tears,
and the president was furious.

99
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,700
Can you lend me money?

100
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
What are you...

101
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,600
Whatever you have now.

102
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,100
What do you plan to do?

103
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,200
Better apologize quickly
or you'll be doomed.

104
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,000
Thanks a million.

105
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,900
I'll get in touch with you soon.

106
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,700
Hey, Matsumoto.

107
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Where did you come from?

108
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,900
What s your name?

109
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,200
Sir... Your lady seems to be...

110
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,000
Don’t leave the room by yourself.

111
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,800
You’ll give trouble to the hotel.

112
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,000
I’ll take care of everything.

113
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,600
Hello.

114
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,400
Yes... I understand...

115
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,600
Sorry, sorry.

116
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,600
Give them to me.

117
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,500
Yeah...

118
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,800
I know...

119
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,600
...But Sawako
isn't feeling so great.

120
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,200
I heard.

121
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,100
They say she's lost her mind.

122
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,200
Is it true?

123
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,400
Hello? . . Hello?

124
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,000
Hello?

125
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,300
Hey, Matsumoto.

126
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,200
Are you from around here?

127
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,200
Where do you live?

128
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,300
Is anything the matter?

129
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
You know her?

130
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,000
Yes.

131
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,700
Can you pay for them?

132
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,400
Let me...

133
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,300
Come on...

134
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,000
Let me see them.

135
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,000
Do you want to try that out?

136
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,400
Go ahead. Open it and try it.

137
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,500
Wait... Let me.

138
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,900
Like this.

139
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:41,600
Let me. You blow it... Like this.

140
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,800
It's cold. Let's go in.

141
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,100
You'll catch cold.

142
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
Here.

143
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,100
Watch out, you morons.
What s wrong with you?

144
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,600
I'll buy you a new one.

145
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,900
Forgive me.

146
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,400
Boss, it's done.

147
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,700
We've finished loading.

148
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,100
Thank you very much.

149
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,100
We appreciate it.

150
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,300
We II be off then.

151
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,900
It was his choice.

152
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:57,900
Boss.

153
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,600
He II be guarding you.

154
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,700
I m Ikeuchi, sir. I'm starting today.

155
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,000
Is your mother well?

156
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,000
Yeah.

157
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,300
I see.

158
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,700
Yeah... Hey.

159
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,900
Thank you.

160
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,900
- Say hello to her.
- Sure.

161
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,300
That's my (yakuza) brother's son.

162
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,300
What's with those guys? Some weirdos.

163
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,800
Excuse me.

164
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,700
Where did you say you came from?

165
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,600
The Takigawa Family, sir.

166
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,800
OH, yeah... In Hiroshima, right?

167
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,600
How long have you been with us?

168
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,400
2 years, sir.

169
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,900
Is that right?

170
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,700
Not easy, is it?

171
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,600
Why did you become a yakuza?

172
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,600
When I was a kid,
I used to fight all the time.

173
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,500
Became a yakuza, because I was bad.

174
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,900
Being strong in fights
doesn't mean anything nowadays.

175
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,400
Better use your head.

176
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:08,400
Being tough did mean something
...in the good ol' days.

177
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:58,800
After you ice him,
stay away from my place.

178
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:04,800
You have to kill even
your (yakuza) brother at times.

179
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,600
Go ahead.

180
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,200
Brother, you're killing me, too?

181
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,600
Sorry about it.

182
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,400
Do it.

183
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,300
Too bad... We were really close.

184
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,100
The doctor s here.

185
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,800
Oh, okay.

186
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:23,800
Damn quack. I can’t tell
whether I'm getting better or worse.

187
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,300
He never says anything straight.

188
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:36,300
Maybe I haven't got
much time ahead of me.

189
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,400
Are you single?

190
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,000
No woman?

191
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,900
Not now.

192
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
How come?

193
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,600
Because women get in our way.

194
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,700
So you're an old fashioned chap, huh?

195
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,300
Am I?

196
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,000
I used to be like you.

197
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:05,800
It's me.

198
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,100
You surprised me.

199
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,800
Here. I made lunch for you, too.

200
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:16,300
Wow. This is terrific.

201
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,700
Will you eat it?

202
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:18,700
I will.

203
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:20,400
Here.

204
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,700
Thank you.

205
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,800
It certainly looks good.

206
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,300
How is it?

207
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,600
It's delicious.

208
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,900
I'm glad.

209
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,100
I'm going out...

210
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,100
Yes, sir.

211
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,900
Take me to Saitama.

212
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:53,900
Sir?

213
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,100
Today's Saturday, right?

214
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,600
Yes.

215
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,900
Brought them from the shop.

216
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,600
Won't they be angry?

217
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,700
No, these were left over.

218
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,800
Next Saturday, I’ll make the lunches.

219
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:30,900
I might not be able to come next week.

220
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Are you busy?

221
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,300
Yes... Well, no...

222
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,000
I'm thinking of quitting work.

223
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:49,000
Not much work at the factory
and it may go bankrupt.

224
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,600
I think I'll do the owner
a favor by quitting early.

225
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:59,400
He's a great guy,
and can’t tell me to quit.

226
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,200
I see.

227
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,000
I'll find a more worthwhile job.

228
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:24,500
The way I am now,
I can't make you happy.

229
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:32,200
Being half-assed isn't good,
so it might be better

230
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,700
to be alone for a while.

231
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,800
So, don't care about me, Ryoko,
and go your own way.

232
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,200
I'll come see you when I'm ready.

233
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:07,900
When I come I'll be dressed well, too.

234
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:14,100
You'll be surprised that
I've made something of myself.

235
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,400
Well, I'll be going.

236
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,500
See you.

237
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,200
Hiro!

238
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,200
I'll wait for you.

239
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,700
I’ll make lunch,
and be here every Saturday.

240
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,000
I’ll make lunch and wait for you.

241
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:19,700
I’ll make lunch,
and be here every Saturday.

242
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,700
I’ll make lunch and wait for you.

243
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,100
Wait here.

244
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,200
Yes, sir.

245
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,800
What is this place?

246
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,500
Don't ask me such things.

247
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:05,600
Sorry.

248
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,700
The woman in question.

249
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,500
Who?

250
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:20,400
She comes here every Saturday
at noon with 2 box-lunches

251
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,700
and waits for her beau.

252
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,600
Excuse me. May we sit here?

253
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:48,300
I'm sorry. I promised to eat lunch
with my boyfriend here.

254
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,100
Can you keep it vacant?

255
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,700
Hey, there hasn't been any hit.

256
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,800
Sorry, sir.

257
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,600
How come there's no hit here?

258
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,700
Sorry, sir.

259
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,100
Forget the sorry, sir

260
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:58,400
Hey, did you put bait on my line?

261
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,200
Yes, tangerine.

262
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,200
Tangerine?

263
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:01,700
Yes, sir.

264
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,800
Tangerine as bait?

265
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:03,600
Yes, sir.

266
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,200
For fish?

267
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,000
Yes, sir.

268
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:09,500
How can you catch fish
with tangerine, you moron?

269
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,000
This is ridiculous. Let s go.

270
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,300
Hey. It flew away.

271
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,200
Got you.

272
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,400
Fans often come here.

273
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,800
A Mr. Aoki came
to see her the other day.

274
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:55,500
She refused.
She doesn't want to show her face.

275
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:59,800
No offense. You re blind
so she won't mind you.

276
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:05,500
You'd be satisfied
hearing her voice, wouldn't you?

277
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:45,300
They say girls become pretty
When they're in love

278
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:51,300
Is it really so?
I hope it's true

279
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:57,500
You can be shy
You can be bashful

280
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:03,200
But when you're in love
Your eyes sparkle

281
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:09,900
Eyes meet and ignite the fire
That's when love begins

282
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:16,000
Glancing each other
That's when the beam flashes

283
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:22,000
Ma-me-mi-mu-me-mo
Magical beam

284
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:27,800
Ma-me-mi-mu-me-mo
Magical beam

285
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:34,100
Eyes meet and ignite the fire
That's when love begins

286
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:40,000
Glancing each other
That's when the beam flashes

287
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:46,000
Ma-me-mi-mu-me-mo
Magical beam

288
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:52,100
Ma-me-mi-mu-me-mo
Magical beam

289
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:01,800
The one who was running...
Was that Nukui?

290
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,000
He's the oldest groupie, right?

291
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,500
For how long?

292
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:09,100
About 4 years...
So is the kid in red.

293
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:15,800
Kid in red ? They're grown ups.
Well, we should be grateful to them.

294
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:20,100
But be careful. They can be dangerous.

295
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:47,800

297
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:11,700
Hey, are you watching the traffic?

298
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,900
Don't put this crap on your uniform.

299
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,900
Watch carefully, you jerk.

300
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:52,700
They say girls become pretty
When they're in love

301
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:58,300
Is it really so?
I hope it's true

302
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:04,300
You can be shy
You can be bashful

303
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:10,700
But when you're in love
Your eyes sparkle

304
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:16,600
Eyes meet and ignite the fire
That's when love begins

305
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:34,500
If you don't mind,
this box-lunch was left over

306
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,500
so please eat it.

307
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:41,100
Thanks always. I'd be happy to.

308
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:05,700

309
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:07,400

My pleasure.

312
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,400
Thanks. This is for you.

313
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:19,600
Thank you.

314
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,500

Yes!

Yes!

Will she live?

337
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:16,300
I just got here.

338
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,700
- What's the cause?
- You've seen her?

339
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,900
- No, not yet.
- No visitors allowed?

340
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,800
- Pardon?
- No visitors allowed?

341

I don't know.

342
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:27,500
I'll tell you all I know at present.

343
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:33,000
At about 11 : 20 last night,
on the way from Odaiba

344
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,700
avoiding another car

345
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,400
her car crashed into a power terminal.

346
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,200
Who was driving the car?

347
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:40,800
Will she return to work?

348
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,200
When is it?

349
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:43,100
Don't know.

350
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,200
A press conference?

351
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,900
There are other patients here, too.

352
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,300
When's the P.C. ?

353
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,700
This is a hospital.

354
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:51,200
Message to her fans.

355
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,000
Please leave. This is a hospital.

356
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:57,400
As I told you earlier, I don't know.

357
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:59,700
Please leave for now.

358
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:05,900
I'll tell you when I know.

359
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:07,000
You haven't...?

360
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:10,300
My daughter's not home.

361
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:14,200
She's retired.
I don't think she'll see anyone.

362
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:17,100
Can't I write her a note?

363
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:22,600
Well... I guess so... Wait a minute.

364

01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,200
- Yes.
- Thanks for your support.

368
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,700
Wait here. She's right there.

369
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:47,600
Yes, ma'am.

370
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,500
Haruna.

371
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:07,300
Your fan from Tokyo
has come to visit you.

372
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,800
I told you I'm not seeing any fans.

373
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:16,300
I don't want fans to see this face.

374
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:19,100
But this person is blind.

375
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:21,200
What?

376
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:36,900
Okay?

377
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,300
She's in front of you.

378
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,800
You're Mr. Nukui, right?

379
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:17,200
Yes.

380
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,400
What happened to your eyes

381
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:26,600
I thought it would be better
if I hadn't been able to see.

382
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I think my boyfriend will soon be here.

383
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:00,400
When he comes, please leave.

384
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:01,900
I will.

385
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:04,500
Sorry for the trouble.

386
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,800
Smells good.

387
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:57,200
Roses are in full bloom.

388
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,300
Ah... I see.

389
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,400
Your boyfriend...
He still hasn't come.

390
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:28,900
He's not coming.

391
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:33,000
So he isn't.

392
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,900
But it doesn't matter anymore

393
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:44,400
because recently...
you come here instead.

394
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:50,700
Maybe I'll stop waiting for him.

395
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,600
Would you join me?

396
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,400
Thank you.

397
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:07,600
They say girls become pretty
When they're in love

398
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:14,800
Is it really so?
I hope it's true

399
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:22,500
You can be shy
You can be bashful

400
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:25,000
But when you're...

401
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:11,300
I roasted some cod roe today.

402
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:13,300
Dislike it?

403
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:15,400
No, it's my favorite.

404
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:17,800
Glad to hear that.

405
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:23,500
Come to think of it
cod roe was his favorite, too.

406
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:05,500
Boss. Boss...

407
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:07,400
Hey, you try.

408
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:08,500
Boss.

409
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:10,000
Darn. Shout louder.

410
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:11,300
Boss.

411
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:12,500
Again.

412
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:13,400
Boss.

413
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:16,000
Boss... Boss.

414
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:19,100
He must be out. Let's go.

415
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:29,500
Give me a break.

416
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:32,200
Take a pose... like models.

417
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,900
What the hell is that?

418
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:45,700
Shut up. Hurry up and shoot.

419
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:48,900
Getting married, right?
Gonna tell everyone.

420
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:54,000
Hey, don't tell anyone.
You d better not tell anyone.

421
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:55,400
All right. Stop it.

422
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:57,400
Stop it. It's dangerous.

423
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:58,600
Hey, stop it.

424
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:00,800
Stop it.

425
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:06,400
It's really dangerous.

426
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:08,600
Watch out. It's dangerous.

427
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:03,200
Everyone, listen up.

428
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:06,400
I have big news.

429
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:10,500
Matsumoto and Sawako
are getting married.

430
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:13,700

431
01:44:13,900 --> 01:44:15,200
No kidding? Really?

432
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,200
Had a crush on her?

433
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:23,200
I didn t.

434
01:44:23,300 --> 01:44:24,100
What a surprise!

435
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:25,200
Congratulations.

436
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:27,400
Thank you.

437
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:33,400
You should buy her a ring.

438
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,500
I couldn't afford it.

439
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:43,000
I'm sorry.

440
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:55,600
Thank you.

441
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:23,900
What're you doing here?

442
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:26,700
You could start a fire.

443
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,500
Come on, beat it.

444
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:32,500
