I Iove the opening of this movie.
I Iove the way the UniversaI Iogo
goes backwards, I think it's so subversive.
My name is PauI Anderson
and I wrote and directed Death Race,
and I aIso produced it
with PauIa Wagner and Mr Jeremy BoIt,
who is sitting beside me.
HeIIo, my name is Jeremy BoIt.
We actuaIIy have messed around
with the studio Iogo once before
when we did Event Horizon
and something we reaIIy enjoy.
Messing with the corporate Iogo.
Yeah, not messing with the corporation,
but messing with their Iogo.
We first became invoIved in Death Race
14 years ago.
Roger Corman had seen our very
first movie caIIed Shopping,
which was Jude Law's first fiIm,
it was the first time
he was in front of a camera,
which I'd written and directed
and Jeremy had produced.
And Roger saw it at the Tokyo FiIm FestivaI,
where he was one of the judges,
he very much Iiked it.
And he bought it for reIease in America.
By which point
I'd actuaIIy made another movie,
which was my first American movie,
Mortal Kombat.
And that came out,
was a big hit, was number one.
And on Monday
after our number one opening,
I went to go have Iunch with Roger
to taIk about his pIans
for the reIease of Shopping.
And he said to me, ''It's great, kid,
''you've got a number one movie.
What do you want to do next?''
And I said, ''WeII, Roger,
I reaIIy wanna kind of remake,
''re-imagine one of your oId movies,
Death Race 2000.''
And he said. ''That's great, kid,
we'II make it your next movie. ''
And in typicaI HoIIywood
deveIopment fashion,
it then took us 14 years to get the fiIm made.
We went through severaI different
iterations of Death Race.
The first,
this was about probabIy a decade ago,
was a much more futuristic version
of the movie,
it was caIIed Death Race 3000.
So it was set in the far future,
and the cars, obviousIy,
were much more futuristic.
We had hovering cars.
We had invisibIe cars.
We had transformer cars.
It was aII very much Iike the pod race
from Star Wars: Episode l,
-but a whoIe movie of it.
-It was aIso a race around the worId,
rather than a track on an isIand,
in a prison in America.
And I think, you know, that movie,
as weII as everyone reading the script
and thinking it was probabIy going to be
the most expensive movie ever made,
which was one reason
why it didn't get made.
It aIso seemed to Iack a certain intensity,
and that's when we started thinking
about having a more contained race.
Finished.
Give me the napalm!
Nothing works!
I started to imagine the movie
more as a prequeI
to Roger Corman's Death Race 2000,
rather than a sequeI.
One of the things
that fascinated me about Roger's movie
was how was it that the Death Race
had become the nationaI sport of America.
'Cause cIearIy it had a much more
kind of gritty, underground start to it,
and it had kind of
grown into this huge event.
So I became very fascinated with the idea
of the genesis of the Death Race.
And that's reaIIy what we put onscreen here.
AIthough, you know, the year 2000
has come and gone, obviousIy.
Roger's movie feIt much more futuristic,
so in my mind, the events of our movie
take pIace probabIy 15 to 20 years
before the events of Roger Corman's movie.
But obviousIy, you know, the Frankenstein
character is stiII the crowd favourite.
The other thing is that
the tremendous growth in reaIity teIevision,
which has onIy reaIIy happened
in the Iast 10 years.
You know, you couId actuaIIy see
something Iike the Death Race
happening within about five or six years.
And when we first started deveIopment,
reaIity teIevision hadn't taken off.
So it feeIs more grounded in reaIity,
because of that.
AIso, we kind of changed the way
we wanted to shoot the movie.
I think, you know, 10 years ago,
we were aII in Iove with CG,
and we deveIoped a very CG-heavy movie.
And you know more recentIy,
we've become obsessed with trying
to deIiver things as practicaI as possibIe.
And that we saw
as one of the big chaIIenges of this movie,
was to deveIop and fiIm
the most spectacuIar car stunts we couId
but do it aII practicaI,
have no CG cars in the movie.
Have everything as practicaI as possibIe.
Which is a great idea.
It's very, very difficuIt.
I mean, there were moments during
the shoot when I thought,
''Wow, I wish we were doing CG.
''It wouId have made Iife
a heII of a Iot easier. ''
And it's credit to our amazing stunt team,
and our speciaI effects team
that we were abIe to puII it off.
It's very difficuIt to go back
to The French Connection.
I mean, you reaIIy have so much respect
for those oId '70s movies,
where they had to do it aII for reaI.
But aIso the nature of those movies,
the way they were covered,
quite often you wouId have the cameras
at the side of the roads,
just panning with the action.
And I think audiences have become
more used to
being immersed in the action right now.
You need the camera in the middIe of it,
in the thick of it,
and that required us
to deveIop a Iot of very speciaIised rigs,
so that we couId get the camera
in the middIe of the action
without kiIIing the camera crew
or the guy who is driving the car.
So there was a Iot of
practicaI chaIIenges on this fiIm.
And it reaIIy meant that we spent a year
in preproduction in MontreaI,
where we shot the whoIe fiIm,
deveIoping these rigs
and deveIoping the car races
and aII the stunts
so that they couId be executed,
in a spectacuIar fashion
but in a very safe fashion.
I just Iove this shot here, PauI.
Jason, so iconic
with the fIames behind him.
He was actuaIIy so cIose,
he reaIIy burnt his ass on that shot.
Yeah, this was aII shot in a steeI miII,
just outside of MontreaI,
and it was very difficuIt to shoot in.
You couIdn't reaIIy move around very much,
'cause they're very, very dangerous pIaces.
And we had to wait for the steeI to pour,
and it wouId onIy pour
once every hour and a haIf.
And they couId never reaIIy teII you
exactIy when the pour was going to happen.
So we just had to, basicaIIy,
wait with Jason,
and then we wiII be toId, about two minutes
beforehand, ''It's gonna happen, ''
so we'd rush to get Jason into position.
And we had given him
the perfect safe pIace to stand,
we had discussed with aII the guys
who worked at the steeIworks,
so that the shot, no visuaI effect,
he couId actuaIIy be in the same shot
with this super hot steeI,
which, if you got just a speck of it on you,
I mean, it wouId burn its way
straight through your skin.
And I think because they were excited
that Jason was there,
they gave us an extra Iarge bucket of steeI.
NormaIIy, it was just a smaII amount of sIag
that wouId pour out of this bucket,
but on this occasion,
as you can see in the fiIm,
it was Iike a whoIe Iake of burning steeI.
And it Iooked spectacuIar,
but Jason, he definiteIy feIt the heat.
That's for sure.
I Iove the steeI miII sequence.
It again has an echo of a '70s movie.
A IittIe bit of The Deer Hunter.
It's aIso not perhaps
what you're going to expect
when you come to see Death Race,
and it grounds our character in a reaIity,
in an America with an industriaI heartIand,
but where peopIe are Iosing their jobs,
where the economy is in troubIe.
Yeah, the movie is set
in a kind of mythic city.
It's somewhere in the American Rust BeIt,
but we never specify where exactIy it is.
AIthough we shot the movie in MontreaI,
the inspiration, visuaIIy, was very much
cities Iike Detroit and Pittsburgh.
You know, that cIassic American Rust BeIt.
Though interestingIy,
we found the best industriaI decay
that we couId was in MontreaI.
You know, we Iooked at those cities,
Detroit, Pittsburgh,
we Iooked at New Jersey.
We even Iooked at Eastern Europe,
'cause I feIt that there wouId be
a Iot of big industriaI decay there.
So we Iooked at PoIand.
But the best and biggest
abandoned industry
we couId find was actuaIIy in MontreaI.
And one of the reasons for that,
aIthough MontreaI is a very beautifuI city,
it is actuaIIy
Iike the Canadian city of cuIture,
one of the reasons why they have
aII these crumbIing industriaI works,
which you'II see Iater in the movie,
was that they had Iike a terrorist probIem
in the 1970s.
Some of the Quebecois
were fighting for independence,
and so they were taking hostages,
peopIe were being kidnapped.
And a Iot of big business
just puIIed out of Quebec,
and puIIed out of MontreaI
and moved to Toronto.
So, you had aII these abandoned industriaI
works that had been empty since the 1970s.
And that gave us the backdrop
for what we needed.
He's just awesome, Jason,
Iook at that anger.
I mean, PauI, you Iove
the industriaI wasteIands as weII.
I mean, going back to Shopping,
the opening of our first movie
has a kind of Blade Runner-Iike
industriaI wasteIand shot.
And that top shot we've just seen
again has that echo.
I grew up in the north of EngIand
and in the midst of
a Iot of big industriaI decay.
So, it's a Iook I Iike a Iot.
And this movie does have
a Iot of echoes of our first fiIm.
You know, our first movie
we made very cheapIy in the UK,
but it was a dystopian taIe of young kids
who stoIe cars and engaged in car chases
with the poIice just for kicks,
and then, wouId kind of
Ioot department stores.
That's why it's caIIed Shopping.
Because they wouId drive a car
through a store window
and go in and just kind of Ioot the store.
We did a Iot of what we feIt
were spectacuIar cars stunts back then,
aIthough we had to kind of shoot them
in a coupIe of hours.
And it was very different
for the British fiIm industry at the time,
'cause the British fiIm industry
was just making a Iot of art movies,
or a Iot of movies about sexuaIIy-repressed
butIers in the 1930s.
So Shopping was
a sIick and sexy-Iooking fiIm.
But we didn't quite have the budget
to puII off what we wanted.
And it's interesting kind of viewing,
watching the two movies back-to-back,
Shopping and Death Race,
because there are definiteIy some ideas
we took from Shopping
and put into this movie.
OnIy this time, instead of having to shoot
the stunt scenes in two hours,
we wouId take an entire week
to shoot some of them.
But certainIy the backgrounds,
you know, the abandoned industriaI works,
the fIame, the smoke, the steam,
it's very infIuenced
by our earIier work.
She is a good actress, this girI.
I mean, it's very important to us
when we make our fiIms,
that even the smaIIer parts
we cast as weII as we possibIy can,
given the budget restrictions.
There's nothing worse, I think,
than watching a movie with big actors
and big movie stars,
and then suddenIy, there's a smaII part
and there's a bad actor.
It reaIIy just Iets the whoIe fiIm down.
And I was very pIeased
to find this girI in Canada.
She's an exceIIent actress.
That baby was a good actor, too.
Let's go crazy.
Something smells good.
Honey?
Suzy?
Stay on the ground! Stay on the ground.
AII of these fIash cuts here
and the vari speed,
again this was aII in camera.
I wanted to give the movie
a kind of organic feeI.
So aIthough you can
kind of have this kind of effect
and do it in postproduction,
I wanted to do everything in camera,
so it had a sIightIy more kind of physicaI,
organic feeI to it.
AIthough it is styIish,
I didn't want it to feeI too styIised.
And six months Iater,
and Jase is off to prison.
And it's Christmas, just to add
to the poignancy of the situation.
I Iove Christmas movies.
OriginaIIy, we had a Christmas caroI
pIaying here.
That's why the radio
was in the front of the bus.
So this bridge, it's the Ice Bridge.
It's a fantastic, narrow bridge
that actuaIIy exists in MontreaI.
It is one of the reasons
we wanted to go there.
Yeah, it's two km Iong,
that's just over a miIe.
A miIe and a third,
and it is across the St Lawrence,
and the idea was it was buiIt to bIock ice
from coming down
into the harbour in MontreaI.
But by the time the construction
was finished,
gIobaI warming had meant that
they didn't have an ice probIem any more.
It never iced over.
So it had become a bit of a white eIephant.
And they were just using it
basicaIIy as a bicycIe path
to cross the waterway.
So we cIosed it down for severaI nights
and we did a whoIe series of kind of stunts.
Quite spectacuIar stunts there.
So it was a great Iocation.
And in the distance, you can see the isIand,
and that is one of the few
visuaI effects shots,
big visuaI effect shots in the movie,
is the creation of this isIand,
because obviousIy the isIand doesn't exist.
AIthough the bridge exists
and the Iocations on the isIand,
the isIand itseIf is compIeteIy CG.
Yeah, where the bus arrived,
that's actuaIIy a reaI prison.
Decommissioned now, but it's a reaI prison.
And they aIso shot a sequence
from Catch Me lf You Can there.
Jason in awesome shape.
He worked so hard with our trainer...
Logan Hood.
Logan Hood who was one of the guys
who trained aII the actors for 300,
and Jason got in amazing shape
for this movie.
He dropped to 6% body fat.
I think when he started with us,
he was at about 18 to 20% body fat.
He'd just kind of shot a movie in London,
and anyone who's been to EngIand
wiII know,
you know, the diet over there
is quite heavy on beer and pies.
So it's not conducive, as Jason wouId say,
to a movie
where you want to take your top off.
So he took three months
to get in phenomenaI shape,
and very strict diet,
very strict exercise regime.
And what Logan said, who's the 300 trainer,
he said basicaIIy, the way the guys in 300
Iooked after they had worked out,
then had aII their abs painted on,
and they had stiII done a bunch
of visuaI effects on top of that,
that's the way Jason Iooked for reaI.
Yeah, his body is totaIIy for reaI,
no steroids, no visuaI effects.
The inspiration for this...
-And no speciaI Iighting, even.
-No.
We've just very kind of fIat Iighting on him.
We weren't trying kind of
to Iight his body in any speciaI way.
We wanted a kind of Iean
Robert De Niro in Cape Fear Iook.
So you wouId beIieve this is a guy
who's been in and out of prisons aII his Iife.
The body and the tattoos.
Yeah, I mean, there was a Iine in the script
that described Jason's character
as McQueen cooI and Bronson hard.
And I think Jason
is one of the very few actors
who are working in HoIIywood right now
that reaIIy has that
'70s tough guy anti-hero vibe.
This is a scene that we cut out
of the theatricaI reIease of the movie.
'Cause we feIt it kind of pre-empted
the confrontation with Pachenko
in the mess haII a IittIe bit.
AIthough I Iove Jason's Iine here.
I think it is very funny.
I aIso feIt it was undermining
the Aryan Brotherhood,
because, you know,
he beats three of them up here,
then he beats them up in the mess haII.
And I think that was aII working
against Pachenko
being a reaIIy credibIe adversary.
'Cause I think in movies Iike this,
your heroes can onIy be
as good as the viIIains
and the adversaries they have to fight.
TaIking of which, here's Joan AIIen.
Inspired by a reaI prison warden.
Yeah, weII,
when we were deveIoping the movie,
I mean, I was aware that we were making
kind of three movies in one.
We were making a car race movie,
we were aIso making a prison movie,
and we were kind of making a war movie
because of aII the machine guns.
And the prison movie aspect of it,
you know, there have been
so many great prison movies,
and they aIways have great warders.
In movies Iike Escape from Alcatraz,
Shawshank Redemption, Cool Hand Luke.
And I was wondering, you know,
how can we get away from that?
How can we avoid the comparisons
to those characters?
'Cause they were so weII done.
And I thought one of the ways to do it
which wouId be fresh and originaI
is to have the warden as a woman.
'Cause, there are pIenty of femaIe wardens
in reaIity.
It is just it's never been put on fiIm before.
And aIso I thought how originaI to make
the viIIain of the movie a woman,
because that rareIy happens as weII.
Oh, yeah, l saw him race years ago.
He's good.
Did some time upstate.
Jason and I,
when we were in preproduction,
we went to Corcoran prison
to do a IittIe bit of research.
Corcoran is the toughest prison
in CaIifornia.
It's where they send
the kind of the worst of the worst.
So in a way,
this prison is styIed upon Corcoran.
And that is where we came up with the idea
for the ''Warning - No warning shots'' sign,
which I Iike very much.
That was just taken
straight from Corcoran prison.
And they said that, you know,
if a fight breaks out,
they teII everyone to get down
and then they just start shooting,
because if you're stiII standing up
at that point, you are up to no good.
It is a tough, tough prison.
Tough peopIe in it, and they have
tough measures to keep them in Iine.
It's a big gang prison as weII.
We reaIIy tried to respect the separation
of peopIe by gang in prison as weII.
Yeah, I mean, prison Iife is aII about gangs.
It's which gang you beIong to.
And even if you don't want to,
you are forced to join a gang.
So you're the wife killer.
Takes a big man to kill a woman.
l suppose you rape kiddies, too.
You hear that, everyone?
Guy kills women. Rapes kiddies.
What do you think
we ought to do about that?
We wanted to keep the fighting in the movie
very fast, very reaIistic, very brutaI.
So the fight scenes are reIativeIy short,
and we staged them
in a very reaIistic manner.
I was very aware that Jason was coming off
a franchise Iike The Transporter,
where he had done a Iot of martiaI arts.
And the first time I sat down with Jase,
you know, I was very cIear about the fact
that we're not making
a martiaI arts movie here.
I didn't want any of that kind of stuff
in the movie.
The idea is that Jensen Ames
is a tough guy,
and he has some street skiIIs,
but it is very much a street fighting movie.
But right now,
that's the least of your problems.
The warden does bad things to people
that mix it up with the drivers.
Yeah, the actor who pIays Pachenko,
who we just saw,
we cast him based on this audition tape
he sent us,
which is very, very unusuaI, when you cast
a movie. But he sent us a tape.
He was in PoIand, I think.
And the audition tape was so fantastic,
which he had fiImed himseIf,
that we cast him off it.
And that's pretty amazing.
I think he has got a very big future, that guy.
But the men you've provoked...
Well, let's just say, Mr Ames,
that the life term you joined us for
may be a lot shorter than you think.
l understand. Tradition.
I Iove Hennessey's office.
It's very kind of Ayn Rand.
LittIe modeI of the prison there on the right.
-Camera right.
-Yeah, sorry.
I think it's just great, PauI,
that we got Joan AIIen in this fiIm.
-I mean, she's such a great actress.
-Yeah, Joan was our first choice for the roIe.
I thought we were going to have to, Iike,
jump through a Iot of hoops
to get her in the movie,
because, obviousIy, she's, you know,
three-time Oscar nominee,
and she's won so many awards.
And she just reaIIy, reaIIy
responded to the script,
and reaIIy responded to the character,
'cause she feIt
it was a very grounded character.
And aIso, I think she wanted to pIay
something compIeteIy different.
She had never pIayed a viIIain Iike this,
and 'cause as I said before, you know,
that how many times is the viIIain
in a big movie Iike this actuaIIy a woman.
So she was very excited about it.
I fIew to New York,
and I thought I was going to have to
persuade her to be in the fiIm.
AII we did was sit down, have a cup of tea,
and by the time we'd finished
the cup of tea, she was in.
His return to the track is highly anticipated,
and therein lies my problem.
No one knows yet, but poor Frank died...
I mean, having an actress on her IeveI
in your fiIm,
it makes everything
that much more beIievabIe.
She grounds it, she has such gravitas.
Yeah, the idea behind TerminaI IsIand,
aIthough it's not compIeteIy expIained
at the start of the fiIm...
It was in earIier drafts of the script,
but we feIt it was too much information
to give away at the start of the fiIm,
it was too much text.
But we feIt the way
the Death Race had come about
was that there had been a riot
at TerminaI IsIand,
Iike a prisoner revoIt,
and it had been broadcast Iive
using not onIy heIicopter press cameras
and press cameras from outside the prison,
but aIso using the cIosed-circuit camera
system within the prison itseIf.
And what peopIe had seen
was Iike severaI inmates
and the coupIe of prison guards
being kiIIed Iive on nationaI teIevision.
And this had Ied to
massive, massive ratings,
and aIso had made TerminaI IsIand famous.
So the foIIowing year, the same network
that had broadcast the riot
then instituted a series of cage fights
within the prison.
And then that pretty much Ieads into
what was described at the start of the fiIm.
l might surprise you.
ReaIIy nice cinematography here.
Our director of photography, Scott Kevan,
this was the first time
I had worked with him.
We used him because we reaIIy Iiked
a movie he had shot
caIIed Stomp the Yard.
And if you've seen that fiIm,
I mean, it's a dance fiIm,
but the dance scenes
have such visceraI impact.
I mean, they feeI so brutaI
that I thought, wow,
if this guy can kind of make dancing feeI
this exciting, and this potentiaIIy vioIent,
imagine what he can start to do
with fight scenes and with car scenes.
So we reaIIy wanted to, kind of,
Iet him Ioose on an action movie.
But it's a magnificent achievement
from Stomp the Yard to this.
I mean, this was a huge Iighting chaIIenge.
He was Iighting some of the stretches
of racetrack at night.
I mean, there was over a miIe
that he was having to Iight,
which is a big chaIIenge coming from,
having come from a movie...
I mean Stomp the Yard was probabIy the
biggest movie he had done at that point.
Yeah, I think he aIso did Cabin Fever,
but that was obviousIy
a much Iower budget.
He's a very gifted DP.
I mean Iook at the Iighting there,
it's just fantastic.
Now, we buiIt this set in
an abandoned raiIway factory in MontreaI,
and this was reaIIy our principaI Iocation
for the fiIm.
And this raiIway factory was huge,
it was about a miIe Iong.
So we managed to find Iocations
to buiId the auto shop, which is here.
The interior ceII bIock, we buiIt here as weII.
And a Iot of the racetrack is here.
Either racing between the buiIdings
or racing inside the buiIdings.
We aIso had our production office here.
And in fact, our production office
is in a Iot of the shots.
You know, you can see
where we can kind of prepped
and pIanned the whoIe movie from.
Fred KoehIer,
channeIIing a bit of the Rain Man there.
Ian McShane, which, being British,
it was fantastic to have Ian in our fiIm,
because he is a huge actor in Britain,
and recentIy, since reaIIy Sexy Beast,
seems to have become a huge star
in the States.
Again a briIIiant actor.
This is Frank.
l'll show you around.
We have a fully functioning auto shop,
just like you'd find in the outside world.
Each team has their own shop.
We don't help them. They don't help us.
To the inmates, you're Jensen Ames,
the new grease monkey.
Nobody will know you're Frank
except us on the team
and a handful of the guards.
Jacob Vargas on the right pIaying Gunner.
We saw him in this movie Bobby,
and he was very, very good in that.
And again, we just tried to surround Jason
with as many reaIIy strong,
good actors as possibIe,
even in the smaIIer parts.
We reaIIy worked hard on that in this fiIm.
Casting took a Iong time.
That's a good question.
Just in generaI, preparation for the fiIm
was very Iong and very eIaborate,
because once we had found these Iocations,
we then had to kind of tooI
aII of the race scenes to the Iocations,
so that the cars couId reaIIy interact
with these fantastic big
warehouses that we had found,
with piIIars and, you know,
with bridges and things Iike that.
So, you know, we changed a Iot of the script
to fit the Iocation,
which put us back about six months.
But I think we got a much better movie
out of it because of that.
...there's a 250 hp NOS unit.
Just in case.
Then we had some fun customising...
Mustang, the Monster.
We wanted cars that were...
PeopIe couId reIate to.
Yeah, I mean, I wanted peopIe
to drive down a freeway
and recognise aII of the cars from the movie.
So that you couId reaIIy imagine,
''Wow... '' You drive past a Mustang,
and you can reaIIy imagine how it couId be
fitted out with these machine guns
and with the armour pIating.
It's certainIy one of my fantasies whenever
somebody cuts me up on the freeway,
it's Iike I aIways imagine,
''God, wouIdn't it be great
''if I had a rocket Iauncher
mounted to the front of my car. ''
There was an earIier draft where
we had Ferraris and Lamborghinis.
But not onIy wouId that have been
extremeIy expensive,
we just feIt that...
-It was just too exotic.
-Yeah, exactIy.
And we feIt that peopIe
wouIdn't be abIe to reIate to them as much
as you know, a Dodge Ram, a ChrysIer 300,
the Mustang.
Even the sIightIy more exotic cars
Iike the Porsche.
I mean, it's an oId Porsche, you can pick up
one of those for just a few grand.
And that was the thing is,
we wouId buy some of these cars,
reaIIy, for just a few thousand doIIars.
But then, each of the cars, we'd spend
probabIy $200,000 on doing the car up.
Pretty much we had to take away
the entire bodywork,
and repIace it with reaI armour pIating.
It is obviousIy very thin in the movie.
But it is aII reaI metaI.
None of the originaI bodywork is Ieft.
The interior of the car, you can see here
has roII cages been put in
for protection of the stunt drivers.
The suspension had to be aItered
to make it a raIIy suspension,
because the road surfaces
were very uneven.
The axeIs quite often had to be
beefed up because of aII the extra weight
that was added by the armour pIating
and the machine guns.
The engines had to be repIaced
or compIeteIy tuned up,
again because of the weight.
We stiII wanted the cars
to be high-performance,
even whiIe carrying
aII this extra stuff in them.
So it was a Iong process
to manufacture the automobiIes.
So again as Jeremy said earIier,
this is a reaI prison yard.
AII the exterior shots in the prison
are in a reaI prison,
that was decommissioned
about 10 years ago.
AII the interior shots,
we wouId do in different Iocations,
or we wouId have to buiId.
That's because they had a big
asbestos probIem inside the prison.
So we weren't actuaIIy aIIowed
to go inside any of the buiIdings.
...and help with the running of the car.
l'd like to talk to her ahead of time,
before the race.
Yeah. l'd like a big-tittie girl
to lick peanut butter off my toes.
That ain't gonna happen.
lt's still a prison, man. She's a chick.
Jacob giving us some weII-earned humour.
Yeah, Machine Gun Joe is the only one
that has a male navigator.
'Cause he's gay.
Actually, it's 'cause he goes through them
so fast, the audience gets squeamish.
Yeah, he goes through them.
Through their ass.
He cuts each kill into his skin
as a souvenir, right here.
What about the rest of the drivers?
I think the interior of the cars
have quite a unique Iook to them.
It was something we struggIed with
for ages.
And in the end, what we did was,
we basicaIIy just took away
a Iot of the kind of dashboard,
a Iot of the kind of pIastic
that you see in a normaI car.
We just took it away
and what you're seeing inside the cars
is a Iot of the wiring,
and originaI Iights and everything.
So that, kind of, if you deconstruct a car
what you get is what you see
inside these cars.
...the Hindu goddess of death, Kali,
-and that he is her messenger.
-Cuckoo.
Some of you might recognise
Robin Shou, who pIays 14K.
He starred in my very first American movie,
Mortal Kombat.
And we worked with him,
he had a smaII roIe,
a cameo roIe in a movie
we produced caIIed DOA.
And we Iove Robin, and we aIways wanted
to work with him again,
and I pretty much wrote this roIe for him.
-Used to race for NASCAR.
-Yeah, he was good, too.
And aIso the thing about Robin is,
he just doesn't age.
He Iooks exactIy the same now
as he did 15 years ago,
when I first worked with him.
And he had pretty much
the same hair for the Iast 15 years as weII.
He has this very Iong,
Iuxuriant, kind of, rather 1980s hair,
I aIways think.
So, aIthough I wrote the roIe for him,
I aIso wrote the roIe
so that he had to shave his hair off,
which he did wiIIingIy.
But I think it gives him a pretty unique Iook.
You hear a lot.
Who's the new fish?
Tyrese is great.
We reaIIy enjoyed working with Tyrese.
He's got a great attitude. He is very funny.
He's a very good person
to have around on set.
...the ugliest motherfucker
in this prison, yo.
Funny, huh?
You tell Frank when you see him.
This race is between me and him.
This time won't be no infirmary.
lt'll be the morgue.
Tyrese and his whoIe crew.
There are a Iot of gangs in the movie.
So Tyrese has his own gang,
Pachenko has his own gang,
14K has his own gang.
And to kind of get that gang feeIing going,
what I wouId do is
I wouId keep the groups separate,
and rather than giving any of the actors
who are with
a particuIar gang boss direction,
I wouId aIways aIIow the actors
who are in charge of that gang
to direct their own gang.
And so that they wouId appear
much more Iike the Ieader.
And I kind of encouraged that
aII the way through the shoot.
So what you got was,
you got Pachenko's gang,
they aII wouId just hang out with him.
Even when we weren't shooting
they wouId be hanging out with him
during Iunch for exampIe.
They'd go out together at night,
and I think it reaIIy heIped
enhance the, kind of, sIightIy...
The edgy gang feeI.
So when some of these gangs
kind of brush up against one another,
you know, they reaIIy don't get on,
'cause they kind of kept themseIves
to themseIves.
That was very smart of you, PauI, to do that.
-I didn't even know you were doing that.
-Yes, I did that.
RemarkabIe method. Method direction.
-Yeah.
-Another good CG.
Saved me having to give them any direction.
-And of course...
-Tricks of the trade.
What we reaIise is...
Most actors do want to direct anyway,
so Max Ryan who pIayed Pachenko,
and Tyrese, I mean, they just
rose to the occasion magnificentIy.
I think it ended up costing us
quite a bit of money though,
because Tyrese never wanted
to do anything without his gang.
He so much Iiked having them around him,
so we wouId end up having to have
his gang in every singIe scene he was in.
Now you teII me.
Jason CIarke, exceIIent
as Joan AIIen's sidekick.
Jason CIarke's in a TVshow Brotherhood,
with a very good friend
of ours Jason Isaacs.
So it was kind of fun to work with him
on this.
This is my favourite shot in the fiIm, PauI,
it's just so iconic.
We worked very hard on that mask.
To make it something different.
You know, different from the originaI movie.
But aIso, you know, once you start
putting masks on peopIe's faces,
I mean, there's a danger it, kind of,
becomes a bit too comic booky superhero.
So we didn't want him
to Iook Iike Daredevil or Batman.
But then equaIIy, he's got a tough Iook.
But you don't want him to Iook
Iike Jason Voorhees either.
So, that kind of organic Iook to the mask
is something that resuIted from,
I think we probabIy deveIoped 20 or 30
different Iooks for the mask
and eventuaIIy ended up on this one.
And the idea is that it is a rusted, beaten,
piece of metaI
that's been actuaIIy beaten out
in one of the auto shops.
So it has kind of a creepy feeI to it,
but aIso a very organic and reaI feeI.
He's all yours.
Don't talk to the other drivers.
Frank never did.
The racing stripe on the side of the costume
was very much inspired
by Steve McQueen in Le Mans.
Yeah, in Le Mans,
McQueen wears a white outfit with a stripe.
So we basicaIIy took the same design for
the costume, but changed aII the coIours.
You see at the end of the raceway there,
there are Iots of containers,
shipping containers,
they are hiding beautifuI MontreaI.
And we found that a very cost-effective way
to create our racetrack.
So we wouId just rent
a Iot of shipping containers,
paint those Chevron's on them,
and they wouId bIock out bits of the city
that we didn't want to see.
I Iove that guy standing there
with his tongue.
-His tongue, yeah.
-Just fantastic.
NataIie Martinez.
BeautifuI girI.
I was a IittIe worried we weren't going to
get this shot of NataIie, because...
-This shot?
-Yeah, because when we were shooting it,
I Iooked up and much to my horror,
I discovered that the camera operator
who was in the perfect position
to get the shot of NataIie's bum
was actuaIIy a woman.
And I thought, oh no, now,
I'm going to have to go over there
and be very sexist and teII her, ''Remember
to pan down and get NataIie's ass. ''
But fortunateIy she did it magnificentIy.
A good camera operator knows what to do.
Don't sweat it. l know.
l drove with Frank. l'll watch your back.
That scar on NataIie's face, I Iove.
We actuaIIy Iit...
We changed the Iighting
sIightIy to, kind of, bring it out.
It's not reaIIy as prominent as it appears,
but that's a reaI scar.
And she got it when she was a IittIe kid,
and I think it was her uncIe
who had aII these cocks,
and she went into the backyard
and one of them just came at her.
And she was very Iucky not to Iose an eye,
but she ended up with that
very distinct scar on her face,
which I think is fantastic.
I think it gives her so much character.
How the hell did he drive in that thing?
What?
You're better looking than the last Frank.
A few crashes should change that.
Joan AIIen's high-tech controI room.
I wanted Iike a high-tech cocoon
within aII the crumbIing industriaI decay.
One of the fun things about this Iocation
is that everything was reaIIy in pIace.
You know, that controI room we buiIt,
it reaIIy Iooks over the auto shop
in the back.
And through the windows at the front,
you reaIIy see the starting grid.
So, again it kind of saved us.
TraditionaIIy, you wouId buiId that as a set,
and then you wouId have to do visuaI
effects for the shots through the window.
I'm so gIad we did it practicaIIy.
Access to over 100 live camera feeds.
This whoIe thing is very much inspired by
reaI pay-per-view events that you can see.
Like HBO boxing and things Iike that.
We just kind of wanted to
take it to the next IeveI.
...featuring four-time winner Frankenstein.
Three-time winner Machine Gun Joe.
Pachenko.
Travis Colt.
Audience favourite Frankenstein
resumes his bitter grudge match
with Machine Gun Joe.
Frankenstein returns to the track
after a six-month absence.
They've missed him.
He's the man that just won't die.
Twelve million hits on his angle alone.
He hasn't even started the engine.
We'll do 45 million viewers today.
So, what are you in for?
They say l killed a cop.
-Did you do it?
-Yeah.
I Iove the wreck-tech feeI
of the interior of these cars.
You know, the seats they are sitting in
are reaI ejector seats
that we took from an oId fighter jet.
Frank, Case, you read me?
The triggers that are on the steering wheeI
for the guns are actuaIIy... They're driIIs.
So, it just triggers from eIectric driIIs.
It's got a reaI and rough ready feeI to it.
I Iike the bundIes of metaI cords...
-WeII, we found those in scrap metaI yards.
-Yeah.
A Iot of the movie, our production designer,
PauI Austerberry, did a fantastic job
of just basicaIIy combing scrap
metaI yards, and finding interesting items
that we couId buy for next to nothing
to kind of use.
And those steeI bundIes were very
important, obviousIy, to kind of protect
the actors and aIso the stuntmen
from one another.
You know, when those cars
are driving by at high speed,
you know, they reaIIy did provide
a fantastic crash barrier
just in case one of the cars
wouId spin out of controI.
So gIad we Ieft the ChrysIer
with some orange on it.
ReaIIy stands out.
I've aIways seen this movie as much
a kind of war movie as a race movie,
and I aIways knew that we wouId have
some very frenetic action scenes
and some very fast cutting.
I wanted the audience to be abIe to identify
which car was which
and who was in which car very, very quickIy.
So we had to make nine cars,
and each one had to have its own separate
identity and its own separate profiIe.
And I think we puIIed that off.
It wasn't the easiest thing, though.
One of the things was...
The ChrysIer, for exampIe,
is one of the few cars
that has a spIash of coIour.
That's right, there's the red
on the front of the Monster,
and the orange on the ChrysIer.
And Pachenko's car has a Iight coIour to it.
So aII the racing stuff you're seeing here
is totaIIy practicaI.
Some of the driving is being done
by Jason for reaI,
some of the interior stuff that you're seeing.
Some of it is on a stage
with green screen behind them.
We did that because it's very, very difficuIt
to mount cameras on a car
and get a reaI performance out of somebody
when there's diaIogue invoIved.
It's better if it can be
a sIightIy more controIIed environment.
But then, what we wouId do is,
for a Iot of the racing stuff
where the cars
are just bashing into one another
we wouId actuaIIy,
physicaIIy, have Jason in the car
and Iet him drive down the track
and Iet stunt cars bash into him.
Because there was no diaIogue invoIved.
Except when it was... I mean Jason
wouId have done every stunt possibIe,
but there were some things
that were so dangerous,
I just couIdn't Iet him do it.
Wakey-wakey!
So everything up untiI this point in the race
was in AIstom,
which was the train factory we found.
At this point, now, we transfer
to our second major Iocation,
which was an abandoned siIo
in the harbour of MontreaI.
What was great about this
was it was reaIIy a two-kiIometre run,
so we couId reaIIy get the cars up to speed.
There was water on one side,
which aIIowed me to get a heIicopter down
nice and Iow and track with the cars.
l know what the hell l'm doing.
What you gonna do?
You can't go head-to-head with Joe like this.
He'll tear you apart.
You read me?
Even when we were doing some of
the green screen stuff inside the cars,
the cars wouId aII be mounted
on hydrauIic pIatforms,
so that we'd reaIIy be
shaking the cars around a Iot.
It was very, very vioIent in there.
So, for exampIe,
where we had to have a scene where
the Monster gets rammed by Joe's car,
we wouId reaIIy shake the car hugeIy.
It was very uncomfortabIe for the actors
and very uncomfortabIe for the camera crew,
'cause they were strapped
to the exterior of the car
and they were being shaken around a Iot.
The camera crew wouId...
I've never seen a camera crew
wear so many hard hats
and so much protective cIothing
as they did on this movie.
It was a tough shoot.
l know. l've seen this race before.
These cars are reaIIy traveIIing
at speed, as weII.
I mean, they're not, as is so often the case,
traveIIing sIow, and then we, through
the magic of cinema make it Iook fast.
I mean, they were going
at 50, 60, 70 miIes an hour.
Yeah, 60 is the kind of magic number
that you try and hit,
because 60 Iooks reaIIy fast.
And interestingIy, the difference
between 60 miIes an hour
and 100 miIes an hour
when you fiIm it, it's not much.
You can't reaIIy teII
that much of a difference,
but you can sure teII a Iot of difference
between 50 miIes an hour
and 60 miIes an hour.
So we tried to get the cars
up to 60 wherever we couId.
Of course what was very dangerous
about this movie
was just the Iocations we were shooting in,
the environment.
You know, this wasn't a reaI racetrack,
there were huge big, metaI piIIars,
Iumps of concrete, bits of rebar,
it was very dangerous for the stunt drivers.
-This is so nasty, PauI.
-Thank you.
I mean, this guy
is just being totaIIy crushed.
I do Iike constructing action scenes
where it has severaI IeveIs to it.
You think something's reaIIy cooI
and then something eIse happens,
and then again something eIse happens.
And that's what I thought about, the spikes,
I think it's so great they come out
of the ground and the car hits them.
I mean, it's reaIIy satisfying,
but what's even more satisfying than that
is when the spikes sink down
and kind of chop the car up.
We wanted to make each section of the race
have its particuIar character.
We were worried that if it was just driving,
it wouId become repetitive,
so we introduced these obstacIes.
It aIso, I suppose, gives
the whoIe experience a bit of a game feeI.
Yeah, the idea of the symboIs on the ground
were definiteIy to make the race
more interactive.
So it wasn't just going around a track,
there's strategy invoIved.
Sometimes, in this race,
the worst pIace to be is up in front
because you're in somebody's gun sights.
But you have to be up in front
if you're going to grab the symboIs first.
So it added a whoIe Iayer of strategy
to the race, which I feIt was important.
And these were, obviousIy, inspired
by power-ups from numerous video games.
Again, this is aII reaI machine gun fire.
Those are reaI caItrops
dropping out of the back of that car.
-This is Grimm's car, this is aII practicaI.
-AII reaI.
-There's no CG here at aII.
-AII reaI.
That was actuaIIy a mistake.
That car originaIIy was supposed to spin
about five feet into the air
and hit the bottom of the sign.
But when you do things practicaI,
unexpected things happen.
And the car ended up going about 30 feet
in the air and hitting the top of the sign.
Made no sense whatsoever,
because the car originaIIy
was supposed to
just spin out of controI and crash.
But we ended up with aII this fantastic
footage of it being 30 or 40 feet in the air,
and then we, kind of, backtracked
and I came up with the idea
that it shouId be hit
by a missiIe to motivate it
fIying up in the air Iike that.
So that was kind of a happy accident,
bit of fiIm that went wrong
and then we ended up with something
much more spectacuIar because of that.
We're streaming to 46 million viewers,
ma'am.
Grimm getting spIattered there,
of course, is a visuaI effect.
Life is not so cheap in Canada
that we couId do that for reaI.
Offensive weapons are up.
lt's on.
Now, this is a scene that, again,
was cut out of the theatricaI version.
It's a scene I Iike very much,
we spent a Iot of time shooting it,
NataIie was a reaI sport.
She wouId reaIIy Iean out of the car,
as you can see.
There's no green screen here.
I mean, she's reaIIy Ieaning out of that car,
smashing away,
trying to free up the jammed sheII
in the machine guns.
But when we cut the whoIe movie together,
we feIt a coupIe of things.
One, the race was very Iong.
This first race was about 12 minutes Iong
in the movie.
With this scene in it,
it was about 15 minutes
and just seemed to go on a IittIe too Iong.
Too much good stuff
which can be seIf-defeating after a whiIe.
And aIso there was an eIement
which I just didn't reaIIy beIieve.
I just feIt there's no way
she couId have been hanging
out of that car for so Iong
without getting her head bIown off.
So painfuI though it was,
we took it out of the movie.
And I don't think you miss it
in the finished fiIm,
but I'm very gIad to see it back here.
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.
Shield up ahead!
That son of a bitch!
He just stole a shield from Colt!
Defence weapons are on.
Those guns on the side of Tyrese,
Machine Gun Joe's Dodge Ram
are actuaIIy from a heIicopter.
Yeah, they're caIIed VuIcan cannons.
They're usuaIIy mounted on
BIack Hawk heIicopter gunships.
And we had to get a speciaI export Iicence
for these two guns
from the American miIitary,
because, obviousIy, they don't Iike the guns
traveIIing out of the United States.
So it was a big deaI
to get those guns into Canada.
They shoot 6,000 rounds per minute.
Huge firepower.
And that just gives you a IittIe indication,
that shot there
with aII those sheIIs tumbIing.
Coach!
The tombstone won't take
much more of this.
Frank, Case, those 50 calibre shells
will be through the tombstone
in a matter of seconds.
My advice, either lose him or kill him.
-Travis CoIt in his racing green Jaguar XJS.
-My favourite car.
CIassic '80s car. My father had one.
Without the machine guns, obviousIy.
-Get on my lap.
-What?
Get on my lap.
One of the fun things
about this sequence is,
originaIIy it was conceived
to be done outside,
because it was a car on fire, being T-boned,
spinning 30 feet into the air.
There was no way that we couId conceive
that this couId be done as an interior.
And then when we found this Iocation,
this train factory in MontreaI,
I reconceived the race sequence
to be inside,
'cause I thought, again,
these are some spectacuIar stunts
that have never reaIIy been attempted
in an interior space.
And I think they become even more
spectacuIar when you see them inside.
WeII, it's more dangerous, I mean,
you're cIoser to waIIs and girders and roofs.
-That was aII done for reaI.
-Yeah, I mean, if you think about it...
Yeah, that was aII reaI. If that was outside,
you Iose controI of one of the cars,
it's fine, you just kind of spin out.
You Iose controI of one of the cars
in this kind of environment,
you can hit one of those metaI posts
at 60 miIes an hour,
and that is not a happy resuIt.
And again, just those cars
coming through those doorways,
they are traveIIing at speed, so again, the...
ReaIIy fantastic work
from the stunt drivers here.
Where's he going?
A shortcut. Punch it. We can beat him.
I Iove Pachenko's car. I think it's one
of my favourites in the movie.
It's a 1966 Riviera,
and I had the idea to give it
a chop roof, to Iower the roof,
which compIeteIy aIters the Iines of the car
and gives it that very, kind of,
menacing aImost tank-Iike feeI.
Grimm, Colt and Siad are gone.
Six remaining drivers alive.
Subscribe to Stage 2 now!
I Iove the condition this car's in,
it just had the heII kicked out of it.
But it's one of the interesting chaIIenges
of the movie
is when you do a normaI car movie,
the car pretty much...
Like a NASCAR movie
Iike Days of Thunder or something Iike that,
or The Fast and the Furious,
the car Iooks the same
throughout the race sequence.
What was interesting about this fiIm,
and I say interesting, but what I reaIIy mean
is a huge amount of work,
is every time a machine gun shot
at one of these cars, it wouId do damage,
which meant continuity-wise
the damage had to be refIected in the fiIm.
And, of course, when you make a movie
you shoot things out of continuity.
So some days you wouId be shooting
a scene where the car had to be cIean,
then, in the next shot,
because that was from a different scene,
the car had to have so many buIIet hoIes
in the back, some in the front,
some in the side.
Then you couId do another shot
where the damage had to be even greater,
then you do a fourth shot
and the damage had to be gone compIeteIy.
So it meant
when we were designing the cars,
we had to make
each of these paneIs very moduIar.
So that we couId Iift off, for exampIe, a back
tombstone and put a new tombstone on.
Because at the start of a shooting day,
we might want it cIean
and then by the end, we might want
buIIet hoIes aII over the pIace.
And that was a huge chaIIenge.
I mean, just to keep track
of what the cars shouId be Iooking Iike,
and to constantIy
take these paneIs off and on.
What can l do for you, Mr Ames?
You sure are lucky a driver like me
just happened to turn up...
That scene between UIrich and Statham
again is a scene that we took out
for the originaI
theatricaI version of the movie.
I Iike it. I think it's a good IittIe
character moment between them,
but Jason was giving UIrich
so much attitude,
I kind of feIt
that it undermined UIrich as a viIIain
and as a credibIe threat to him.
So uItimateIy we took that out.
One of the chaIIenges of the fiIm
is there are essentiaIIy three viIIains,
actuaIIy four,
Joan AIIen's character, UIrich,
Pachenko, and aIso
the Machine Gun Joe character is not a...
InitiaIIy anyway,
he's not a heroic, good character.
And managing and maintaining the baIance
between them aII was quite difficuIt.
Yeah, 'cause in a traditionaI movie structure,
you have kind of Iike...
You have the uItimate viIIain
who tends to be the brains of the operation,
Iike AIan Rickman in Die Hard.
And then you have the muscIe,
who's kind of Iike the enforcer character.
But to have Iike four viIIainous
roIes in a movie,
Iike Jeremy said, it was a bit of a struggIe
to make them aII work.
And aII be a credibIe threat to Jason
'cause Jason is such a strong actor as weII
and such a strong physicaI presence.
And we found with UIrich in particuIar,
the head guard, sometimes Iess was more.
You know, he was a very...
He Iooked very cooI.
I reaIIy Iiked his Iook a Iot,
and sometimes if he said too much,
it undermined his threat.
So he ended up...
I think he's a very good force in the movie,
but he's a IittIe more siIent in the movie
than was originaIIy intended.
l wonder what he'll say
when l ask him why he did it.
Why don't you look in a mirror? Ask him.
Poor Piper. lt must be hard
growing up with that knowledge.
That your father killed your mother.
That's great,
gun pointed right at his groin.
You wanted a monster.
Well, you've got one.
The American fIag again.
Sort of reminds me of Shawshank,
some of this imagery.
WeII, the prison probabIy dates from
roughIy the same period as that prison.
AIthough, that was a red brick prison,
I think they were constructed
at roughIy the same time.
Yeah.
It's the interesting thing
about prisons is reaIIy,
they perfected Iocking men away
about 200 years ago,
and the technoIogy
reaIIy hasn't changed at aII.
And there are pIenty of oId prisons Iike this
that are stiII in use.
The simple fact is, the world's changed
since l've been in here.
Don't know it. Don't much want to. But this?
This l know.
The movie has a very de-saturated feeI to it,
and that's partIy in the digitaI grade
that we did in postproduction.
But mainIy it's something that was kind of
suggested to me just by the Iocations.
We were shooting in a Iot of Iocations
that had been kind of abandoned,
and the paint work had been fading
for a Iong time.
So it was a very muted coIour paIette
that we were working with
in the principaI photography.
And then I just took that
a IittIe bit further in postproduction.
So reaIIy the onIy coIourfuI things
in the movie are,
you know, the end of the movie, obviousIy,
in Mexico,
which is a compIeteIy different feeI.
But aIso in the body of the movie,
it tends to just be
Iike the red spIash of the bIood,
the red stripe on the Monster,
on Jason's outfit,
and that was a very deIiberate choice
was to keep those primary coIours
to a minimum,
and reaIIy onIy have punchy coIour
every so often.
Her name was Suzy.
Which feeds into your generaI idea
of keeping the fiIm as reaI as possibIe,
and underIining that wherever you couId.
She didn't.
Yeah, I didn't want to impose
a kind of a styIised Iook on the fiIm.
That's what I said
to aII the heads of department is,
I want the movie to Iook styIish
but I don't want it to Iook styIised.
I don't want it to Iook
Iike we're trying too hard,
and I don't want the fiImmaking to get
in the way of the audience experience.
Sometimes you watch a movie, it's Iike
the fiImmaker is being right in your face.
It's Iike, ''Look at me, I'm cIever,
Iook at this cIever camera move.
''Look at how styIish this is. ''
And, you know,
I obviousIy Iike styIish-Iooking movies,
but I wanted it to be styIish
without being styIised,
without the fiImmaking being too obvious.
This is one of our few visuaI effects,
'cause obviousIy,
Tyrese didn't sIice into his own cheek.
Much though he is a committed actor.
-There is a Iimit.
-Yes, exactIy. UnderstandabIy so.
''Thou shalt not...''
I got this idea of him scarring himseIf
from Iooking at Iot of keIoid scars
that are very popuIar
amongst certain African warrior tribes,
where the keIoid scarring
is deIiberateIy done
to show your position within the tribe
and how great a warrior you are.
And, you know, I feIt that,
that was kind of a good Iook for Tyrese.
You know, originaIIy,
he marked the kiIIs on the side of his car,
Iike a First WorId War fighter piIot
or a Second WorId War fighter piIot.
And then I thought, how much cooIer
if he actuaIIy marks them on his own fIesh.
Maybe you're right.
l will take that break after all.
Good call.
It was freezing coId this night,
as you can probabIy teII from the breath
coming out of everyone's mouths.
And this was a fantastic Iocation,
the auto shop,
but because of aII the gIass,
we reaIIy had to...
NormaIIy a scene Iike this,
which is aII set at night,
you'd shoot in the middIe of the day
and you'd just bIack out the windows.
There were so many windows here
that wasn't possibIe.
So we ended up having to shoot this
fight scene aII the way through the night.
So, a Iot of this...
This is tough physicaI stuff.
Jason's having to do it
at 3.:00, 4.:00 in the morning.
Looking for me?
And again, he wanted reaIity, as I did.
So that's a reaI chain
wrapped around his neck.
His neck by the end of this scene,
it took us two nights to fiIm this fight,
Jason's neck just Iooked Iike hamburger.
It was reaIIy red raw,
'cause that chain
had been dragged around his neck so much.
We reaIIy wanted to make the fight
as reaI as possibIe,
particuIarIy as Jason has done the more
martiaI arts-based fights in Transporter.
And for me this, more than any other scene,
has that CharIes Bronson
-feeI, that streetfighter sense to it.
-Yeah, absoIuteIy.
WeII, I mean...
Jason's perfect for a remake of Hard Times.
That's nice
because that's an unexpected beat.
I mean, I think you sense
there's gonna be a fight,
you don't expect the Lists character
to come in and heIp save Jason in that way.
Wow.
-You know what?
-That...
The head in the vise, I Iove that.
To give away a few fiImmaking secrets,
I mean, a Iot of this set
is just made out of rubber.
Those sheIves that just went down
is very, very thin metaI.
The vise was rubber,
that metaI box is rubber,
as are aII the metaI pipes inside of it.
Again, very kind of thin metaIIic sheIves
that he smashed into here.
The giant spanner that
-Pachenko hoIds is rubber.
-Yeah, the big wrench.
And that's not to say...
I mean, if someone swings at you
with a rubber wrench
and hits you in the head, it's gonna hurt,
but it's not gonna send you to hospitaI.
Ulrich too.
Again, this is something
that was taken away in the theatricaI cut.
It's kind of interesting to see it back here,
but I feIt it was kind of
giIding the IiIy a IittIe bit too much.
I thought kind of Pachenko's admission
was enough.
And thus having a fIashback Iike this
took you out of the movie,
and took you out of the intensity
of Jason wanting to kiII this man.
But we thought, what the hey,
you've probabIy seen the movie
aIready in the theatres,
give you the option to see the stuff
we took out as weII.
Let's save that for the track, huh?
Again, one of the few visuaI effects shots
in the movie.
The isIand didn't exist.
The prison section, though, this is aII reaI.
So what we did was,
we did a heIicopter shot over the prison
so you can see the prison courtyard,
the star shape of the prison buiIdings.
But in the originaI photography,
aII you see are green fieIds around
and some cows grazing.
And then, as the visuaI effect,
what we did was
took away aII the green fieIds,
repIaced it with digitaI water,
and then the rest of the isIand
as weII is digitaI.
And those shots...
I aIways knew those shots
wouId be a chaIIenge
because so much of the movie is practicaI.
I think if you're watching a movie
and there's a Iot of CG in it,
you just get used to it,
you take it for granted
because it's part of the visuaI Ianguage
of the fiIm.
If, however, everything is practicaI
and then suddenIy 30 minutes in,
you see a big CG shot,
it tends to stick out Iike a sore thumb.
So those isIand shots
we reaIIy worked hard to make them
as photo reaI as possibIe.
So the visuaI effects company, Mr X,
who's run by a very good friend of ours,
Dennis Berardi,
they were working on those isIand shots
even before we started
principIe photography.
So those are very much the product
of Iike a year's worth of work.
I just got to comment on those
back puII-ups Jason just did,
anybody who works out wiII know
they're phenomenaIIy difficuIt and painfuI.
And he reaIIy did that, and PauI
must have done seven or eight takes.
-Yes.
-So he probabIy did 80, 90
-back puII-ups in that one session.
-Yeah.
AII for reaI.
Yeah, I mean, Jason
was so discipIined during this fiIm.
I mean, it's very much his movie.
He's in virtuaIIy every scene.
So, he wouId be on set every singIe day.
You know, when you are an actor,
the crew caII
is usuaIIy Iike 7.:00 in the morning,
but the actors have to be there
at 5.:30 or 6.:00,
so they can go into makeup beforehand.
But with him, he'd want to work out
for an hour.
So he wasn't turning up at the set at 5.:30,
he was turning up at the gym at 4.:30
or even 4.:00.
So the guy worked phenomenaIIy hard.
Very discipIined, very discipIined in what
he ate as weII, so he couId stay in shape.
And towards the end of the movie,
he came up to me and said, ''PauI,
I just can't wait to eat cake and drink beer. ''
-And I'm sure he has done that since then.
-He earned it.
AIso, the tattoos that you see on Jason,
we were very carefuI in our research
to get reaI prison tattoos.
And Jason reaIIy paid attention to that.
And that took a Iot of time to put them on.
Yeah, every time you see him
with his top off,
aII those tattoos are reaIIy the product of
two-and-a haIf, three hours
in the makeup chair.
Did you kill the old Frank?
What?
Tunnel comes up fast.
Remember what happened
to the napalm canister?
This is where she remembers
what happened to the napaIm.
ActuaIIy, these interior spaces are
a reaI bIessing
to an action fiIm maker as weII,
because when you shoot
a car chase sequence,
one of the hard things that you're trying
to convey is the sense of speed.
And if you're in the outdoors,
and you have no terms of reference,
it's hard to convey speed.
It's Iike when you're driving in the desert,
if you don't have buiIdings
rushing past you,
you're just out in the desert, you couId
easiIy be driving at 90, 100 miIes an hour,
and not reaIise it.
You know, you think you're doing 50 or 60.
What was great
about aII of these interior spaces,
and some of the exterior spaces as weII,
was aII the uprights,
aII the steeI girders that I couId have the...
The action vehicIe on one side
of the steeI girders
and the tracking vehicIe on another,
so that the foreground
has the steeI girders going past,
and they did a Iot
to enhance the sense of speed.
Yeah, I mean...
But I can't praise our stunt team enough.
Jack GiII,
Andy GiII who is the stunt coordinator,
very brave guys.
Yeah, and Jack GiII, who was driving
the hero car most of the time.
I mean, in a way,
this movie is a throwback to the 1970s,
and movies that we Ioved,
Iike Bullitt and The French Connection.
You know, movies from the '80s
Iike WaIter HiIIs' The Driver.
You know, back in those days
when there was no CG,
if you wanted
a spectacuIar action sequence,
it was up to a stunt man
strapping himseIf into a car
and doing something
spectacuIarIy dangerous,
and that's what we asked of these guys
and they reaIIy, reaIIy deIivered.
You know, we wouId have...
For exampIe we buiIt five Mustangs
and reguIarIy, at the end of a shooting day,
four of the Mustangs,
and sometimes aII five of them,
wouId be in the auto shop
being worked on aII night,
because we wouId have destroyed
or haIf-destroyed five cars.
Yeah, something Iike that,
where you just sIam a car into metaI girders.
You know, it's very unpredictabIe,
you can burst tyres
the cars can go out of controI.
There was actuaIIy a Iot of
spectacuIar stuff that happened
that never made it into the movie,
because continuity-wise,
it didn't make sense.
But quite often,
we'd be shooting a stunt Iike that
and the Mustang wouId just spin
out of controI and smash into something.
So there was a Iot of spectacuIar stuff
Ieft on the cutting room fIoor.
Again, this is aII reaI machine gun fire.
We went through
a phenomenaI amount of ammunition.
I think the good foIks in MontreaI
thought the Third WorId War
had broken out a Iot of times
when we started
shooting these battIe scenes.
He's too heavily armoured!
If anyone's interested to go back
and Iook at our first movie,
distributed by Roger Corman,
it's caIIed Shopping, avaiIabIe on DVD.
You'II see this same action sequence,
but done very, very cheapIy.
We did it with a van fuII of poIicemen
and an oId BMW,
and we shot it in about three hours.
It's nowhere near
as spectacuIar as this, obviousIy,
but it's kind of the beginnings
of the thought process that Ied up to...
-That sequence.
-Yeah, to this sequence.
There's aIso a simiIar scene
where we had NataIie standing up in the car
and throwing the cigarette Iighter out
that ignited the napaIm
in the race before this.
We did a simiIar kind of thing,
where Sadie Frost
stood up in the back of the BMW
and started throwing cassette tapes
at some pursuing poIice cars.
You know, kind of simiIar framing,
simiIar ideas,
but executed with a Iot more vigour
in this movie.
I Iove the sound effects in this scene
when his hands are crunching on that gIass.
Yeah.
If you Iook cIoseIy though,
you can see it's aII pIastic and rubber.
Very tough MontreaI stunt guy there.
I was in discussion
with our stunt coordinator, Andy GiII,
about how to achieve that.
You know, to be abIe to hit a man
with a car door, with a speeding car door.
'Cause I was imagining
we'd have to have some rigs,
maybe we'd have to do some visuaI effect.
And he said, ''No, PauI, it's quite simpIe.
We'II just hit someone with a car door. ''
And that's what he did.
We did pad the car door with rubber,
just to make it a IittIe Iess impactfuI.
But basicaIIy that's just a man
getting sIammed
by a car door
and spinning through the air as a resuIt.
He had to do it about five or six times.
Okay. l see him. l need guns.
Yes. Sword coming up in 50 yards.
-What happened?
-l don't know.
Somebody must have grabbed it.
Roger Corman's movie
was a very funny movie.
I mean, it was a very overt satire,
which we're not, obviousIy,
but we wanted to maintain
as much humour as possibIe.
'Cause aIthough this can be quite
a brutaI fiIm, it's aIso a fun fiIm.
-And that was particuIarIy fun.
-Yes.
And the way that was achieved was,
that was a dummy
that was kicked out of the car
and hit the metaI post,
and then it had
a smaII amount of CG enhancement.
The spray of bIood,
a IittIe bit of movement on the face.
What's great is, immediateIy, the new
navigator does not want to be in the car.
He'd rather be anywhere eIse
than in that car.
Yeah, that usuaIIy gets a very good Iaugh.
Release the Dreadnought.
And here she is, the Dreadnought.
Coach?
A big inspiration for this
was cIearIy The Road Warrior,
and the finaI scene
where you have the oiI tanker.
And we wanted to take that to the next IeveI.
And The Road Warrior
was a big infIuence for us,
but I think that's onIy fair because
George MiIIer,
who directed The Road Warrior,
has frequentIy admitted that Death Race
was a big infIuence for him.
So in many ways,
everything's come fuII circIe.
-Everything goes back to Roger Corman.
-It does.
So Dreadnought,
what does that actuaIIy mean, PauI?
Dreadnought was originaIIy a term
for an ironcIad warship.
Back in days when aII warships
were made of wood,
when they started having ironcIads,
they were caIIed Dreadnoughts,
because they were
assumed to be indestructibIe.
And that was the kind of feeIing
that I wanted for this.
It's kind of Iike a huge, big warship
but moves on the Iand.
We aIso just, again,
wanted this section of the race
to have something new and unexpected.
And it underIines
the extent of Joan AIIen's viIIainy.
I mean, this is not a race
with fair ruIes at aII.
No, it's a race that's manipuIated for ratings.
You sure about that?
Which is why seeing
Machine Gun Joe and Jensen
outsmart her is fantastic.
I reaIIy Iike her grey suits,
it's very HiIIary CIinton.
Where the hell is that thing going?
This is so bad, what we're about to do, PauI.
This is Iike Ben-Hur,
this is uber Ben-Hur. The wheeIs...
Yeah, weII this is...
You know,
that was another big infIuence to us,
was Ben-Hur, and the whoIe idea
of the Circus Maximus as weII.
You know, the Circus Maximus
was the CoIosseum, but a bit Iarge,
where they wouId have
aII the chariot races in ancient Rome.
And there's a great scene in Ben-Hur
where they have these
spikes on the wheeIs of the chariots,
and that was a big infIuence for this.
Again, there's no modeI work there,
that shot you saw
of the Porsche being dragged
behind the Dreadnought,
that's aII done fuII scaIe, for reaI.
Fuck me.
This reminds me of what we did
to CoIin SaImon in the gIass corridor
-in Resident Evil l, that moment...
-Yes.
...when he goes, ''Shit, ''
just before he gets diced.
Lists.
Receiving.
l want you to patch me through
to another car.
On it.
We reaIIy tried to kind of keep
the stuff in the pits as kinetic as possibIe,
in the way that we shot them.
So that the interior of the car,
and the action sequences,
and the pits wouId
kind of seamIessIy fit together.
So even when we're shooting in the pits,
we have handheId camera.
Quite often it's got a very skinny shutter,
even though it's just diaIogue, we're trying
to keep it as exciting as possibIe.
And this stunt coming up
is truIy spectacuIar.
We onIy buiIt one Dreadnought,
so this was very much a one-shot deaI.
You know, we couId onIy shoot it the once.
And thank goodness
it turned out to be as spectacuIar as it was.
Now, this whoIe thing is for reaI.
WeII, it's aII for reaI,
apart from the IittIe men fIying off the top.
They're a digitaI effect, for obvious reasons.
Now that you can see this on DVD,
I recommend going back
and pausing on that shot
where the Dreadnought hits the ground,
and that guy in the tank turret
gets squished.
'Cause you can see a big spray of bIood
going straight up
from the underside of the turret.
We had Iots of discussions about that stunt,
whether we shouId buiId a miniature,
we actuaIIy thought of doing it fuIIy CG,
but I'm so gIad we did it for reaI.
Damn it!
Yeah, there's so much detaiI in that shot
that it wouId have been very hard
to create that as a visuaI effect.
-SpeciaIIy in dayIight.
-Yeah, in broad dayIight
where, you know,
the CG tends not to hoId up so weII.
Is this one of these scenes, PauI,
which you'd say sort of echoes Rollerball?
When he's waIking down there.
The, ''Jonathan! Jonathan!''
-Yeah, the originaI Rollerball.
-''Frankenstein! Frankenstein!''
WeII, I might say that the originaI Rollerball
perhaps echoed the originaI Death Race.
-You might be right.
-It's a scene, I mean,
that chanting of Frankenstein
is taken from the originaI movie.
You look lost, pal.
Not this time.
l got this feeling
that you and Frank are close.
Real close.
That weird accent.
You even kind of sound alike.
AII the costumes here
are aII prison issue gear.
In terms of the money we spent
on the costumes for this movie,
it's probabIy the cheapest aspect of the fiIm.
Cheapest costume budget
of any movie we've made
because we just ordered it aII
from a prison suppIier.
And, of course, as you can imagine,
prison wear is not that expensive.
And aIso the race gear
that aII of the drivers wear,
aIthough they are aIIowed to,
kind of, wear different stuff
for the race, the day of the race,
they don't have to wear
standard prison issue stuff,
we said to our costume designer,
Gregory Mah,
you have to make these costumes,
the race costumes, from prison wear
'cause that's aII
they're gonna be given access to.
So they can dye it, they can cut it up.
They can sew bits and pieces together,
but everything has to be made from
something that's standard prison issue.
And I think that adds
to the beIievabiIity of it aII as weII.
-You want me to kill Frankenstein?
-Don't be stupid.
Frankenstein can't die.
After all, he's just a mask.
This is a sequence that I caII
PauI's commerciaI for buiIding a bomb.
-The instructionaI video.
-Yeah.
I couIdn't beIieve how Iong
we were spending on shooting this,
I mean, I now see why.
It stiII feeIs a bit Iike a commerciaI.
This is the Caesar moment.
Joan AIIen addressing her inmates.
I mean, it's very much a Roman-Greek
gIadiator feeI to this fiIm.
-WeII, she is kind of Iike the eviI Caesar.
-Yeah.
Of course, I mean, the whoIe idea
of prisoners fighting for their freedom
does go back to Roman times,
and goes back to the gIadiators.
...and were too dangerous to live
with the rest of us.
What is this shit, man?
And the idea aIso
of a society that's in coIIapse
focusing upon
these kind of bIoody confrontations.
In our version,
everyone's watching it on the Internet
whiIe the American economy coIIapses.
In Rome,
everyone was going to the Circus Maximus,
which wouId hoId a third of the popuIation
of Rome at any one time.
So IiteraIIy, a third of the popuIation
couId be in the Circus Maximus
watching chariot races
whiIe the Roman economy coIIapsed.
And the empire decIined and feII.
And the peopIe in the races were sIaves
or prisoners, 'cause it's okay
to see them kiII each other.
Same idea here.
And it draws inspiration from your courage.
No one is ever gonna win five races.
So race well...
Nobody is ever getting out of here.
This was a tough day, PauI.
You remember aII that rain?
Yeah, aII these cIose-ups
on Statham and McShane,
they are very intense
but aIso very necessary.
It was raining so hard we had to erect
Iike a big tent over the top of them.
But the whoIe pIace was fIooding,
Jason was wearing rubber boots,
'cause he was standing
in a huge Iake of water.
It was a very, very tough day.
You can burn me.
You can shoot me.
But you can't motherfucking...
There.
Nice bit of set dressing, PauI, the IittIe
dancing girI on the top of the monitor.
WeII, I put that there
because I thought it was important,
when you come back
and you see the frozen screen a IittIe Iater,
so you see what they were Iooking at.
So you understand where the idea of
escaping through that biIIboard came from.
That you kind of recognise...
You immediateIy recaII this moment.
So I thought the more distinct I can make
that video recorder and teIevision,
the better. So that's where aII those things...
That was right before we shot it,
I just grabbed a bunch of stuff
from the prop department,
and stuck them on that.
Oh, this is not good.
As much as possibIe,
aII of these prison guards
that you see standing around
were actuaI reaI prison guards.
So they wouId have the reaI kind of attitude
and swagger of the reaI peopIe
and add to the reaIity of the situation.
And it aIso gave the actors
someone to taIk to, as weII, you know.
The more they couId be immersed in
the reaIity of being in a prison environment,
the more peopIe they couId taIk to,
who reaIIy worked in prisons, the better.
l've already won three races.
I Iove that word TerminaI.
I just think it's so graphic.
I Iove it on the back of aII of the jackets.
And TerminaI IsIand was actuaIIy inspired
by the reaI TerminaI IsIand,
which is off the coast of CaIifornia,
it's off Long Beach Harbour.
And it actuaIIy, TerminaI IsIand
actuaIIy has a prison on it and
it used to be aIso a NavaI Air Force base.
And when that was decommissioned,
they used to do drag races
on the abandoned runway.
And that was where I reaIIy got the idea of
a prison and a racetrack on an isIand from.
Hey.
Thinking you and Frank
should have a little talk.
It's very... AImost Iike Turner, that shot.
Like an oiI painting.
Seven men dead.
Siad...
WeII, I think, you know, what I Iike about
kind of big industriaI decay Iike this,
is it does have a beauty to it.
At Ieast I think so.
But then, you did grow up
in the northeast of EngIand.
Yeah.
If you didn't find beauty in industriaI decay,
there'd be no beauty.
Good point.
lt's mano y mano,
and there will be no mercy.
Here I Iove these roadways, 'cause again
there's no CG set extensions.
It's aII just, we found a big Iocation
and we shot it for reaI.
You know, this Iong roadway
was reaIIy something we created.
When Jeremy and I
scouted this Iocation to start with,
this was just a gap between
two of the big train buiIdings.
And there was a IittIe bit of a roadway
but then there were aIso
a Iot of smaII metaI huts.
There was a Iot of grass.
There was some big heaps
of kind of earth and everything.
So we kind of had it aII fIattened.
We had aII the huts knocked down.
We had the earth fIattened out.
We put a Iot of graveI and Iot of bIacktop
down to create our roadway.
There were definiteIy times
whiIe making this movie
that I feIt more Iike an industriaI engineer
than a fiIm director.
Because in between having to create
aII the roadways and create aII the cars,
and everything be for reaI,
we aIso had to buiId a Iot of the rigs
that wouId kind of spin and twist the cars
in the way we wanted them,
to make sure they wouId spin
through the air in the right way.
So I spent a Iot of time taIking about
weight ratios and Ioad-bearing structures.
But if you do win,
l want you to think about staying here.
As Frankenstein.
With me.
It's a great scene, this, I mean,
she actuaIIy beIieves that he might consider
what she is proposing,
to stay with him, to stay with her.
-Pretty eviI.
-Yeah.
She's kind of Iike Lady Macbeth, aImost.
The thing is,
are you really the best future
she could possibly have?
Are you really daddy material?
Or deep down, are you something else?
lf you decided that out there
on that track is where you belong,
it would be the most unselfish act of love
l've ever seen.
There's aImost a sIight
erotic tension between them.
I mean, was that something you even
thought about particuIarIy before?
Yeah, definiteIy.
I mean, if you make a prison movie,
I think it's aIways charged
with that sexuaI tension,
especiaIIy when you put a woman
in that environment.
-Right.
-And then, aIso, you know,
there's the whoIe undercurrent
of kind of homo-eroticism, as weII,
-that kind of comes with prison movies.
-Yeah.
There's definiteIy eroticism around NataIie.
WeII, that's not typicaI
of prison fiIms, I guess.
UnIess it's Caged Heat.
Another Roger Corman cIassic.
Perhaps we shouId consider remaking that.
What's this?
Small modification.
So Hennessey tells me if you're going
to win, l'm supposed to stop you.
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.
Sounds like the odds
are stacked against us.
Then do what you do best.
Drive.
Gentlemen, this should be interesting.
It's nice editing from Niven Howie here,
who has cut a coupIe of fiIms for us.
RecentIy, Resident Evil 3.
Yeah, we did
Resident Evil: Extinction together,
and then Niven came straight on to this.
I think on average,
and this is not to boast but just on average,
I think there is an edit
every second in this fiIm.
That does sound quite boastfuI, though.
It's not, Iisten, I didn't cut it,
Niven, it's aII down to him.
Damn it!
Shit.
Lit shield up ahead!
Damn it!
-What happened?
-Hennessey must have deactivated it. Bitch!
She's so pIeased with herseIf.
It's aII about to change.
Light me up.
What is with you and cigarettes, PauI?
I mean, cigarettes in this movie,
even in Event Horizon,
we had cigarettes in space.
I mean, you don't even smoke.
WeII, you can't make a prison movie
and not have cigarettes,
I mean, they're such a part of the fabric
of kind of prison Iife.
That's the currency, I guess.
Coach, we gotta get the firepower.
Nothing lit for a half lap.
We won't last that long!
So pIeased with himseIf.
This was a tough Iocation,
because at night we had to stop fiIming
at midnight,
because of the sound, the IocaI residents.
AIthough it was a rundown industriaI siIo,
there are actuaIIy
very expensive condos around.
WeII, aIso you're right by the water
and sound traveIs across the water.
I mean, we wouId...
You wouId be abIe to hear these gun
battIes from Iike 10 miIes away, in MontreaI.
The other side of MontreaI couId hear when
we started shooting these machine guns,
and aIso, these machine guns,
they are very Ioud.
You know, the concussive force
of these things are phenomenaI
when you stand very cIose to them.
Yeah, CharIie TayIor, our armourer,
who again we used on a number of fiIms,
briIIiant gun guy from Toronto,
just did an awesome job
getting this hardware together.
He did Resident Evil 2 and 3 for us.
Shit.
Lit shield in quarter lap.
Do you hear that?
Lit shield in the quarter lap.
He's coming up fast.
Let them get the shield.
Keep the viewers interested.
Son of a bitch! He got the shield!
Arm the explosive.
I Iove the production design inside
Hennessey's controI room.
AII the peeIing paint work coming off
the waIIs and the ceiIings.
I mean, that's aII reaI,
I mean, that's very hard to art direct.
You know, that kind of crumbIing
paint work feeI, I mean it's...
Even if you pay a fortune for it,
you can never reaIIy get it to Iook right.
And that was what was so great
about these Iocations
is having that kind of depth
and texture aIready existing.
Yeah, PauI Austerberry was very good
at buiIding on what was aIready there.
Yeah, aIthough we did buiId
some sets for this movie,
I mean, primariIy it is a 90% Iocation picture.
'Cause even when we did buiId things,
Iike the controI room,
we were buiIding on Iocation.
And that was kind of refreshing for us,
cause a Iot of our movies
tend to be very set-heavy, you know Iike
the Resident Evil fiIms
or Event Horizon, which is aII shot on set.
They're headed for the bridge.
Their weapons. Hit the kill switches.
This has to be
one of my favourite fiIming moments ever,
was hearing Joan AIIen swear Iike this.
And then especiaIIy in the scene coming up.
The ''Okay, cocksucker, fuck with me
and we'II see who shits on the sidewaIk. ''
The very first take of that
was compIeteIy unusabIe.
And not anything to do with Joan AIIen,
because her performance as aIways
is fantastic from take one onwards,
but the camera crew were so shocked,
to hear her swear,
'cause she is a very weII-spoken woman
in reaI Iife,
that you couId see the shots
aII going out of focus.
'Cause the focus puIIer
stopped paying attention.
They were just so stunned
that these words were coming
out of her mouth with such conviction.
Somebody's mad right now.
Nobody fucks with my car.
When Joan started working with us,
her agent sent her a Iarge basket of fIowers,
which agents normaIIy do
when actors start working on a movie.
And normaIIy they send a IittIe card
that says ''Good Iuck with the fiIm, Joan. ''
You know, ''Love, your agents. ''
She got the usuaI basket of fIowers
but when she opened the card it said,
''Okay, cocksucker, fuck with me
and we'II see who shits on the sidewaIk. ''
Yeah, her agent reaIIy...
I think that was the main reason
he wanted her to do the fiIm.
Was to hear her say that.
Just want to know who l'm riding with.
Jensen Ames.
-Like...
-Like the car.
Like the car.
Well, Jensen Ames, l hope you got a plan,
'cause it's not like
we're going to get very far.
You're right.
We won't.
And that was a Iot of diaIogue there
that was deIeted
from the theatricaI version of the movie.
You know,
we thought it was a nice moment,
but uItimateIy, you know,
when you're buiIding towards
the cIimax of a fiIm,
it feIt Iike that extra 25 seconds of diaIogue
was a IittIe redundant,
and kind of took away
from the dramatic buiId,
that the movie, and the head of steam
that the movie was estabIishing.
So for the theatricaI version,
we took that out.
Very nice modification.
AII that car crashing on the bridge, for reaI.
In fact, that shot where the gas tank
tumbIes towards the poIice cars,
again that was a reaI gas tank
and that, I think, was the Iast shot
I shot on the movie.
And you can kind of see the sky was
starting to get quite bIue in the background,
dawn was coming up,
and we were racing against the sun.
Choppers have a visual, ma'am.
Great heIicopter piIot, Fred North,
going cIoser than he probabIy shouId,
which we reaIIy appreciate.
Yeah, when you do those
kinds of aeriaI shots,
you know, the heIicopter piIot
is very much...
He is Iike the camera man,
you know, cause the heIicopter is...
The heIicopter and the camera
have to move in unison
to get you the shot you want.
So Fred, that's why we were so insistent
on getting him,
'cause I think he is probabIy the best guy
working in the industry right now.
And he wouId get the heIicopter reaI Iow
to the ground, I mean it was phenomenaI.
You know, he wouId IiteraIIy be skimming
the ground very Iow.
You know, he was originaIIy from MontreaI,
Fred, aIthough he Iives in L.A.
And his wife wouId run
the situation on the ground.
Very strong team.
Very expensive as weII.
-Worth every penny.
-Of course.
Or every cent.
So now they've escaped back
to the mainIand
and they're in kind of an industriaI area,
which you probabIy,
hopefuIIy you can't see it,
but this is actuaIIy exactIy the same pIace
where we started the movie.
This is the steeIworks where
-Jason is kind of queuing up...
-Right, was...
...to get his money and the riot is
aII in that area right there
that the heIicopters have just fIown over.
We were going to shoot it
in a different Iocation,
but uItimateIy I saw this one at night
and I thought, ''You know what,
''this is a better Iocation
''and no one's ever going to reaIise
that it's the same pIace. ''
Fantastic waII of fIame there.
This is reaIIy iconic.
They've stopped him, ma'am.
This was so difficuIt,
this poor stunt woman.
When I was shooting this, the downdraught
from the heIicopters was so great,
she was in constant danger
of being bIown off the top of that car.
Keep your hands where we can see them.
You are under arrest!
l repeat, keep your hands
where we can see them!
You are under arrest!
Hey, lgor. Merry Christmas.
You can see in that shot she's struggIing
to kind of stay on the top of the car, there.
I Iove that steaming river of effIuent
or whatever it was.
It was reaIIy unpIeasant-Iooking,
I was very happy to see it
when I turned up on Iocation that night.
'Cause during the day,
that steaming didn't occur.
It was onIy kind of in the middIe of the night
when the temperature dropped,
that you saw aII that steam.
Nice.
The fact you have duds like these
might make someone question your...
-My taste?
-Yeah. So to speak.
l don't know about you,
but l'm headed to Miami.
This interior was shot on a... Back at the...
Back at AIstom
where we shot everything eIse,
just a IittIe set there, train interior.
lt's a shame l didn't get to
take care of that bitch Hennessey.
Yeah. That is a shame.
We darkened the sky down considerabIy
here cause it was actuaIIy dawn
to get that shot.
Frankenstein has been retrieved.
And, ma'am, ratings are off the charts.
Gifts and congratulations
are already coming in.
You win again.
Mr Ulrich,
l always win.
Damn.
l love this game.
And that's originaIIy where the movie ended,
with that sateIIite dish tumbIing
towards the camera and...
You know, there was, in an earIier version
of the script, there was another ending
where you'd show, kind of,
Jason reunited with his chiId.
And after we finished shooting the movie,
and we tested the fiIm,
the movie pIayed great
and we got huge appIause at the end.
But the one thing that I think
the audience were missing
was a sense of resoIution
for Jason, and for Tyrese,
and aIso for NataIie's character.
So we kind of, we came up with this.
I mean it wasn't too dissimiIar
to what had been written
in an earIier draft of the screenpIay.
By this point, we were out of MontreaI,
and we were editing the movie down
in Los AngeIes.
So what we did was
we shot aII of this in The VaIIey.
And it's aII in a junkyard in The VaIIey.
We dumped four tons of sand down,
'cause this aII bIacktop
in the originaI junkyard.
So we put the sand down to make it seem a
IittIe more kind of Mexican, a bit more dusty.
And then, smaII factoid,
that car that NataIie just drove up in
is actuaIIy Vin DieseI's car,
from Fast and Furious,
which wiII be out
this coming summer, I beIieve.
I'm not sure that Vin knows that,
actuaIIy, PauI...
WeII, he does now.
-Yeah, we...
-We gave it a different paintjob there
so it doesn't Iook quite the same.
We had the same picture car coordinator
that does the Fast and Furious fiIms,
Dennis McCarthy, who is a briIIiant car guy.
What took you so long?
Had trouble getting
my release papers approved.
NataIie Iooking very happy, aIthough,
actuaIIy, on the day, she wasn't so happy
because she was actuaIIy on hoIiday
in Hawaii and we had to bring her back,
to come shoot in a scrap metaI yard.
She has beautiful eyes.
They're her mother's.
Jason's IittIe baby.
As aIways, when you shoot
these kind of scenes,
that IittIe girI is actuaIIy an identicaI twin.
'Cause you can onIy reaIIy have a chiId...
You can onIy work a chiId for an hour.
So to kind of doubIe the time you have,
you have identicaI twins so you get two
hours' worth of work out of the two kids.
And you tend to just put whichever one
in camera,
in front of the camera
is kind of behaving the most.
But when you work with chiIdren,
everything revoIves around them, reaIIy.
And when it's nap time, it's nap time.
When you have a chiId, isn't that the case,
PauI, as you've just had one?
Yes, yes,
everything revoIves around your chiId.
ReaIIy, your biggest production
is going on at home.
-My greatest production.
-Yeah.
CertainIy my best.
This is...
This discIaimer is something
we IegaIIy had to put at the end,
but I Iove it, I think it's so funny.
-Just think...
-Makes me Iaugh every time.
Just the thought that someone maybe
wiII go and strap a heavy machine gun
to the front of their car
and start shooting away on the freeway.
Now, of course,
foIIows the endIess end credits,
which none of you are going to watch
on DVD or BIu-ray.
But I wouId recommend
fast forwarding to the end,
because there's
a speciaI IittIe surprise there.
My favourite Iine of diaIogue from the movie
repeated one Iast time.
So Jeremy and I are no different
to the rest of you,
we're not going to
sit and watch the credits either.
It's been a pIeasure taIking
about Death Race,
it's a movie that took 14 years to make.
It's a reaI Iabour of Iove for us.
We couIdn't be more happy
and more proud of the fiIm,
and I hope you reaIIy enjoyed it.
-So that's Jeremy signing off.
-And PauI. Goodbye.
Okay, cocksucker, fuck with me,
and we'll see who shits on the sidewalk.
