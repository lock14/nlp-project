Hey, mark,
do you want to play ball?



Tomorrow, buddy.



Here you go, mark.



Great. Thanks.



I've spoken to the council
about your deviant parties.



There's no need to do that.
Just knock on the door, we'd let you in.



They're sending a policeman.



Oh, I do hope so.



Mark.



Thanks.

Two, four, six, eight!



Is that copper really straight?



Two, four, six, eight!
Is that copper
really straight?



Two, four, six, eight!



Is that copper really straight?



Two, four, six, eight!
Is that copper
really straight?



Two, four, six, eight!



Oi, grab hold of this,
will you, mate?



Oh, no, sorry.



Just for five minutes,
till me friends get here.
Come on.



It... it's just that I don't
really want to be too visible.



Is it your first pride?



Yeah, first anything.



Yeah, well,
this is the best way.
You need to throw yourself in.



The thing is
is that I'm actually
from bromley.



Well, don't worry about that,
we're a broad church.



No, I mean, it's the train.



It's further out
than people think and I...



Oi,
I've been dragging this thing
on me own



since marble arch.
What, are they buckets?



Surprised you have
to ask that question,
Mike, coming from accrington.



Mike, does anything
get rid of love bites?



No. Where's mark now?
Right,
listen up, everyone.



Where exactly have you been?



I want everyone
to take a bucket
and start rattling.



This is for the miners.
Miners?



We agreed on a banner, mark.



It's a show of solidarity.



Who hates the miners?
Thatcher.



Who else? The police,
the public and
the tabloid press.



That sound familiar?
Surely, mark...



The only problem we've got
that they haven't
is Mary whitehouse.



And that can only
be a matter of time.



Mark...
I know, it's not been planned.



It's not been thought through
but it's a really
good idea, isn't it?



Isn't it?



What am I supposed
to do with this?



Give it to the lesbians.
They love a banner.



Oh, for God's sake.



Right, looks like you're
off the hook, mate. Good lad.



Whatever
mark says, we do it.
Don't ask me why.



Disgusting.
Yes.



We're collecting
for the miners
and their families, guys.



Gays and lesbians
support the miners
and their families.



I was wondering,
do you need a hand?



Well, well, if it isn't bromley.



I mean, my last train
is actually not for ages.



Gays and lesbians
support the miners.



Gays and lesbians
support the miners.



Gays and lesbians
support the miners.



Support the miners.



Guys, support the miners.



Gays and lesbians
support the miners.



- Collecting for the miners.
- Dig deep.



Support the miners.
Come on.



Support the miners!
Support the miners!



It's just a couple of the lads from college



and one of them lives in chislehurst.



<i>So he can't be too late, either.</i>
<i>I've got my key.</i>



Just mind yourself on that last train.



There's weirdos and all sorts on there.



Thanks, mum.



<i>¶ It makes none,

<i>¶ and you must be

<i>¶ the devil will find work

<i>¶ but now you make me
feel so ashamed</i>



Oi, bromley.



Over here.



I'm hiding from that girl.



Why?



She broke my heart
at a smiths concert.



I've never met a lesbian before.



Really?
I've never met anyone who irons their jeans.



I live at home.



No shit.



Is that where you got
that lovely broach?



That's embarrassing.



It's today.



What are you, 10?



I'm 20.



I wouldn't go
spreading that around.



You're illegal, darling.



Sixteen for the breeders,
21 for the gays.



Did you learn
nothing on that march?



You're still a minor.



Jesus.



Victory to the minors.



Don't make a mess, okay?



They've counted it.



Well, come on, you've collected as much as anyone.



Stephanie.



Were you with Jeff
in the bell last night?



For fuck's sake. It's a bruise, okay?
My neck is bruised.



No red wine on the floor, please.
Ashtrays.



It was a pretty
good march today.



Not much in the way
of beatings or abuse.



Hardly any petrol bombs
or swastikas.



Is it me or are
the police getting soft?



It's funny.
They've stopped hanging



around outside our clubs lately.



What's that about?



Do you think they've finally got sick
of all that Donna summer?



No, never!



My guess is they
went somewhere else.



To pick on someone else.



My guess is that
while we're enjoying



a temporary reprieve,
they're here.



Giving these poor sods
the shit we usually get.



Now, these mining communities
are being bullied just like we are.



Right?
Bullied by the police.



Bullied by the tabloids.
Bullied by the government.



Do any of them need a hug?



No. What they need is cash,
and they need it urgently.



Yeah, because the miners have
always come to our aid, haven't they?



Are you fucking kidding me?



Why don't we talk about today?



Today, with only a couple of buckets,
we raised nearly 200 quid.



Right, think what we could achieve
if we really started trying.



I'm from durham.



Well, you know exactly
what we're talking about, then.



I know those bastards
kicked the shit out of me



every morning on
my way to school



and every night on my way home.



We are proposing to meet
at least once a week.



And just to do
as many collections as we can.



Oh, and...
And we've got a name.



Lgsm.



Lesbians and gays
support the miners.



It's not very catchy.



It's a support group, Steph,
not a skiffle band.



Right, come on.
Let's have a show of hands, shall we?



Who's in?
Guys?



Come on, guys, please.



Oh, come on, guys.



Is that it?



We've actually been
looking for things



that we could do together
as a... as a couple.



Well, this is perfect.



Youse can feed the miners
and your relationship.



How many's that?
That's six.



It's better than five.
Not as good as seven.



Jonathan.



Oh, God.
Here come the gay libbers.



Brilliant party, geth.



I'm sure you could use
the back room here



if you're looking
for a base, that is.



We are... uh, we are.
That's amazing, gethin, thank you.



Well,
what about me and Jonathan?



Or is it exclusively
for the under-25s?



Oh, no, of course not.
Everyone's welcome.



<i>¶ touch me, baby, tainted love ¶</i>



are you sure
Jonathan's interested?



He's at a bit of a loose end
at the moment.



He just needs something
to occupy him. A project.



What about bromley over there?



I've... I've just started
catering college.



Good.
Congratulations, all of you.



You're the founder members
of lesbians and gays support the miners.



Terrific.
Let's bring down the government.



Support for the miners.



Give generously.



Put your hand in your pockets
for the miners.



Lesbians and gays
support the miners!



<i>National union of mine workers.</i>



Oh, hello.
I represent a group



called lesbians and gays
support the miners and...



Hello? Hello...



And there's
the desired consistency.



It's glossy and wobbly.



Glossy and wobbly.



Jonathan.



Why don't you go
out with them today?



Because I've got
better things to do



than run around
with a bunch of kids.



What happened to
gay lib, Jonathan?



I don't know.
What did happen to it?



Is that gethin's boyfriend?



Jonathan. He stabbed
susannah York with an ice pick.



He's an actor.



Support the miners.



Lesbians and gays
support the miners, sir.



Lesbians and gays
support the miners.



We've raised money and we're looking for
a mining community to...



<i>Repeat the name
of the group, please?</i>



Lesbians and gays
support the miners.



<i>Somebody will call you back</i>
<i>in due course.</i>



Sure,
but you've said that before and we...



They'll call back.



They will.



Mark, face it.



They're on strike.
They're busy.



They don't want to take our money
because we're poofs.



And a dyke.
They'd rather starve.



Maybe we should just
hand the money over anonymously.



I mean, we don't have to
say we're gay, do we?



No.



Well, at least then
we'd be helping.



No, this is a gay
and lesbian group



and we are unapologetic
about that.



Jesus, why are you even
wasting time with all this?



Mark.
They will call us back.



It has nothing to do with the fact that we're poofs.



And a dyke.
They will call us back.



End of meeting.



They're never
going to call us back.



Someone needs to go with him.



First rule of the group.



I'll go.



Thank you, Steph.



Lesbians and gays
support the miners.



Lesbians and gays
support the miners.



Pervert!



First rule of the group, comrade.
Nobody collects alone.



Lesbians and gays
support the miners.



Lesbians and gays support...



Gethin.



Gethin, come on.
You're supposed to be a bookshop.



We don't have maps, mark.
It's a gay bookshop.



People ask for the poems
of Walt Whitman.



I hope there's a good reason why



Let me just get this right,
so we are going to pick a mining town



completely at random
and just ring it, is that the plan, is it, mark?



Yeah, the town hall,
the council.



What, it's as easy as that?



Why not?
We bypass the union all together.



I think it's inspired.
So do I.



See? Even bromley agrees.



Right, here we go.



A-ha.
So, what do we want? Um...



Somewhere north...
Industrial?



Humberside. Is...
Is that a place?



Oh, Jesus Christ.
Give it to me.



If it's miners
you're looking for...



There. Wales.



Of course.



That's a big fucking coalfield.



That's the brecon beacons.



That's a coalfield, there.
And that is.



All right, and what are we supposed to do?



Stick a bloody pin in it?
Do you know people, gethin?



No, I haven't been
back there in 16 years.



Why not?



Well, let's just say there isn't



always a welcome
in the hillsides.



Shall I get you the phone book?



Well, what's the worst
that can happen?



Oh, hello.
I represent a bunch of screaming homosexuals.



May I inquire
about your communal baths?



What's that got to
do with a strike?



Nothing.
I'd just like to inquire.



All right, all right.
Thank you.
All right. Oi!



If we're going to do this, we need to take it seriously.
Come here.



Right.



0-1-9...



What's the welsh for lesbian?



Hello?



Yes.



I see.



Yes!



<i>¶ Solidarity forever</i>



<i>¶ solidarity forever</i>



<i>¶ solidarity forever ¶</i>



it really didn't occur to you to get a description?



Well, she were off
the phone that fast.



Maybe we should try and look
more obviously gay.



Achievable goals, please, Jeff.



- Shut up. That's him.
- Are you sure?



Oh, my God,
he's coming towards us.



How did you know it were him?



It's the same as in a nightclub.



It's all in the eyes.



I'm dai Donovan.



From the dulais valley.
Right.



You must be mark.
Yes, hello.



Hiya. Mike.



Steph.



Hello.
Joe.



Jeff.
Dai.



So, lgsm.
What does that stand for, then?



You get a garbled message
over the phone.



I thought the l was for London.



London something.



I never dreamed for a moment
it was l for...



Hi.



This money you've raised,
it's all from gays and lesbians?



Mostly, yeah.



Right. There we are.



This is just the beginning.
Oh?



Mmm-hmm.
We've got big plans.



Well, I'm not going to pretend I'm not surprised.
You can see that.



Truth told, you're the first gays
I've ever met in my life.



As far as you're aware.



That's true.



And you're the first miner
I've ever met.



Yeah.



Now, I... I want you
to do something for me.



I want you to go back to your community
and convey my thanks.



My personal thanks.



And the thanks
of all the people of dulais.



Yeah, of course we will.



- Won't we?
- Yeah.



Yeah, yeah.



Won't we, mark?



Who fancies a pint?



<i>¶ I'm the shy boy,
you're the coy boy</i>



<i>¶ and you know
we're homosapien, too... ¶</i>



you can have five minutes.
Are you sure about this?



Dead sure.
Yeah, but for dai...



Oh, I'm all right, lad.



Trust me, dai,
if you can handle this,



it's going to make
a huge difference.



What's he going to do,
take his clothes off?



I'm just going to say thank you.



Well, don't blame me
if you get bottled.



<i>Right, shut up, you fuckers.</i>



Ooh...



<i>Thank you. Right, listen.
Some of you know me.</i>



<i>My name is mark Ashton.</i>
Commie!



<i>I'm going to invite somebody
onto the stage now</i>



<i>who wants to talk to you and I want you</i>
<i>to listen to him.</i>



<i>He comes from the dulais valley</i>
<i>in South wales and he, um...</i>



<i>Well, he's a striking miner</i>



<i>and he has something
he wants to say to you.</i>



<i>I've had a...</i>



<i>I've had a lot of new experiences</i>
<i>during this strike.</i>



<i>Um, speaking in public.</i>



<i>Standing on a picket line.</i>



<i>And now I'm in a...
A gay bar.</i>



Well, if you don't like it,
you can go home.



<i>As a matter of fact,
I do like it.</i>



Ooh.



<i>Beer's a bit expensive, mind.</i>



<i>But really,
there's only one difference</i>



<i>between this and a bar
in South wales.</i>



<i>The women.</i>



<i>They're a lot more
feminine in here.</i>



<i>What I'd really like to say
to you tonight is thank you.</i>



<i>If you're one of the people that's put money</i>
<i>in these buckets,</i>



<i>if you've supported lgsm,
then thank you,</i>



<i>because what you've given us is more than money,</i>
<i>it's friendship.</i>



<i>And when you're in a battle</i>



<i>against an enemy so much bigger,</i>
<i>so much stronger than you,</i>



<i>well, to find out you had a friend</i>
<i>you never knew existed,</i>



<i>well, that's the best feeling
in the world.</i>



<i>So, thank you.</i>



<i>¶ When two tribes go to war</i>



<i>¶ a point is all

oh, my God.
I haven't even finished this one.



Lesbians and gays
support the miners.



Support the miners.



So you're the only girl?



That's right.
I'm the l in lgsm.



Good speech.



Thank you.
Thank you very much.



I've worked a few
tough crowds myself over the years.



In politics?
In panto.



Oh, right.



Okay, lgsm, over here, please.



That's something else we could use.
What's that?



An official photographer.



Jesus, mark.
We don't even have an official typewriter.



Nice and close, please.



I could do it.



I've got a camera.



It's a really good one.
I'd be happy to do it.



All right, bromley,
if you're sure.



Course he's sure.



Never let it be said that lgsm
discouraged youth enterprise.



Right, then.
What are you going to say, "cheese"?



Victory to the miners!



Victory to the miners!



Martin, come on.



Tell them you've run
a whole canteen before.



You're not just
packing food parcels.



Go.



And don't look
so bloody worried.



It's not
the first day of school.



What do they need to come here for?
We sent them a thank-you note.



Every other support group
has been invited.



Every other support group was



approved by the whole committee.



Oh, I see.



Dai had to make a snap decision.



This is all my fault.



He was in London, Maureen.



What would you have done?
Told them to keep their money?



I'll tell you exactly
what I would have done...



But they raised the money.



All right,
I run a civil meeting here.



If you want to
scream and shout,
get on the pickets.



I don't have a problem
with what they are.



None of us do.



It's the men.



Well, you bring a load of gays



into a working men's club,
you get trouble.



I'm sorry.



No other group
has raised as much money.



I'm not disputing that.



Or been so consistent.



Then why don't you
just invite them?



I'm sorry, but everyone's saying
they don't have a problem.



Good, they've raised the most money,
so invite them.



And who the bloody hell are you?



- You did what?
- I know.



But hefina, she's like the head honcho,
absolutely terrifying,



well, she obviously
can't stand this Maureen.



Kids, mind the fish fingers.



What's the matter?
You told me not to sell myself short.



I'm not talking about that.
Gays and lesbians!



We're trying to
fit in here, sian.



What?



Volunteer, I said.
Run the canteen.



They didn't want me
on the canteen.



They wanted me on the committee.



All right, so keep your head down.
Do the paperwork.



Don't start stirring it all up,



inviting a load of
gays and lesbians.



Oh, it's like that, is it?



You know, I had you down as many things



but prejudiced was
never one of them.



I'm not prejudiced.
No?



I'm a realist.
I know what small towns are like, sian.



And I know exactly how those lads
are going to react.



You think so?
I know so.



I'm standing on a bloody picket
with them day after day.



It was a majority decision.
The committee decided.



Well, I hope you
and your bloody committee



can guarantee their safety, sian,
I do, I really do.



All aboard the deviants bus.



No pushing,
no community singing.



And absolutely
no back-chatting the driver.



Right, where are we going?



Wales.



Fuck me.
Someone better roll me a little spliffette.



What I'd like to know is
what bromley told his mum and dad.



Yeah.



I just...
Oh, it's no big deal.



Come on.



I said that
I was doing so well at college



they were sending me
on a residential course.



Doing what?



Choux pastry.



Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!



Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!



Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!



Bit late in the day
for that, isn't it?



That's the fourth one I've done.



Fast as I put them up,
they pull 'em down.



I'm running out of staples.



<i>¶ Every woman is
a lesbian at heart</i>



<i>¶ every woman is
a lesbian at heart... ¶</i>



you can't possibly say
that every woman is a lesbian.



Why not?



'Cause they're not.



Esther rantzen isn't a lesbian.
My mum's not a lesbian.



How do you know?



How do I know my mum's
not a lesbian?



What he's trying
to say is you can't



make grand,
sweeping generalizations.



It's not acceptable.

Look at the map.
We should have turned left at that village.



How can that be a village?
It doesn't have any vowels.



- Hang on a minute.
- Yes?



I think so.



Are we here?



We're here.



Oh, my God.



Come on, let's go.



Right, then.



I guess we just...



I think I'm starting
to freak out slightly.



Dai, your gays have arrived.



Good to see you again.



Good to see you.



Hi, there. Welcome. Welcome.
Come on in, everybody.



Great to see you again.
Great to see you again. Hello.



Come on in.



Welcome, everybody.
This is my wife, Margaret.



Hello.
How are you?



This is Gail and sian,
who wrote to you.



This is hefina,
who chairs the welfare committee.



This is Gwen, and this is cliff,
our club secretary.



Um, I'm going to officiate you.



Oh, good.



Hold that and
name here, please...



Mmm-hmm.



And in the corresponding box,
the group or organization you represent.



In this case...



Lesbians and gays
support the miners.



Yep. Quite. Absolutely.



Thank you.



Thank you very much
for having us.



Now, I'm hoping you can clear something up
for me about lesbians.



Not now, Gwen.
It's something I was told



in the covered market



and to be honest with you,
it did surprise me.



Let them get settled
in first, shall we?



Oh.



Now, who's making the speech?



A... a speech?



It's no big deal.



One of you just has to go up on stage
and say a few words.



Just so we know
who you are, like.



I'll tell the band to shut up
and we'll push you on.



And welcome, all of you.



To be honest,
I never thought you'd come.



Anybody else feel like
appointing themselves leader?



Didn't think so.

<i>Will you welcome their spokesman</i>
<i>onto the stage? Thank you.</i>



<i>Thank you, dai.</i>



<i>Thank you, um...
Falling leaves.</i>



<i>Actually, dai Donovan
made a speech at our local pub</i>



<i>and he's a pretty
tough act to follow,</i>



<i>so maybe now is the moment</i>

<i>And that's it.</i>



<i>And we'll keep on trying to help you</i>

<i>because we've been through</i>



<i>some of the same things

<i>Listen,

<i>then one in five miners
must be, too, right?</i>



<i>So that's at least a fifth of you</i>

night, everybody.



Goodnight, dai.



There we are. All settled in.



It's teething problems, love.



Everything will be all right
once they start to mix.



I'm not talking
about running away.



I'm talking about
making a dignified exit.



Tomorrow before dawn?



We can't just waltz
into a town like this



and expect them not to...



Slit our throats?



Just be cautious.



I don't know about anybody else



but I don't have to travel to wales
to get my head kicked in.



I can very easily
get that at home.



Anyone who wants
to go should go.



But I came here to help.
Yeah, but they don't want your help.



Well, they can tell
me that to my face.



Until that time,
I'm a member of lgsm



and I'm going to do
what I set out to do.



No hiding, no running away,
no apologies.



Me, too.



Yeah.



And me.



And me.



This is a welsh castle, mind.



None of your Norman rubbish.



According to legend,
the maiden Sabrina came here, see,



and became the goddess
of the river severn.



How'd she manage that,
then, cliff?



By drowning.



"Sabrina fair
listen where thou art sitting



"under the glassie, cool,
translucent wave"



and so on.



I grew up in northern Ireland.



I know all about what happens
when people don't
talk to each other.



That's why I've never understood,



what's the point
of supporting gay rights



but nobody else's rights,
you know?



Or workers' rights
but not women's rights.



It's...
I don't know, illogical.



There's a lodge banner over 100 years old.



We bring it out for special occasions, you know.



I'll show it to you one day.



It's a symbol, like this.



Right? Two hands.



That's what the labor movement means.
Should mean.



You support me, I support you.



Whoever you are.
Wherever you come from.



Shoulder to shoulder.
Hand to hand.



Dai!



There they go.



They're bringing them in from London, from Bristol.
All over.



They're pulling the lads in for anything now.



Well, they can't do that.



There's two from my street in custody right now.
Lee and Carl.



Where's your humanity?



We're citizens of this country, mind.
Citizens.



No, I mean, they can't do that.



It's totally illegal.



A police officer has
the right to stop you



if, and that's
the important word here,



if he has reasonable grounds to believe



a crime is going
to be committed.



Now, you're absolutely
sure about this?



Police harassment, dear.
I could set it to music.



And if he does?



Then he must formally charge you



within 24 hours of that arrest.



But "reasonable grounds"
means concrete evidence



that can stand up in court.



It doesn't mean he doesn't like
the look of you.



That's the same whether you're standing
on a picket line



or trolling down clapham high street in full drag.



Hefina,
tell Martin to mind the kids.



Where you going?



The police station.



She's finding her feet.



Right, gentlemen, listen to me.



A police officer only has the right
to detain a group of people...



You need evidence
to stand up in a court of law.



They need concrete evidence.



If you keep them
for longer than 24 hours...



No proof. No proof.



And I will not be leaving this desk until you do.



We've got all day,
so chop-chop.



Nobody said anything
about hiding who we are.



Yes, they did. You.



I just think if everybody
takes it easy on the...



Flamboyance.



Then we're more
likely to fit in.



I'm sorry, just to be clear, when you say flamboyance,
you mean gay?



And when you say everyone,
you mean me?



Jonathan.
Good.



It's just I haven't spoken 1950s in quite a while.



Over here, please.
We're packing parcels.



You'll stay for a pint?



No, you're all right, cliff.



Welfare's had a change of atmosphere,
if you know what I mean.



I don't know what
you mean, Lee, no.



He means these faggots.
Oi.



If it wasn't for
those people over there,



you lot would
still be in the Nick.



What?
He's right.



They make me sick,
that's all I know, dai.



That's enough.



Physically sick.



- Gays?
- From London.



They were the ones, Carl.
They got you out.



I thought sian got us out.



They told her...
They told her what to say.



Carl.
It's you lot, is it?
The gays.



What's going on?



No, it's all right.
It's all right.



We're lgsm. Lesbians and gays
support the miners, yes.



My name's mark Ashton.



You'll have a pint,
will you, mark?



What I was told about lesbians really did shock me.



It can't be true, can it?



You're all vegetarians?



Actually,
Zoe and I are both vegans.



So, you live together like,
you know, husband and wife.



But what I want to know is...



I know what you're going to say.



Which one does the housework?



Oh, well, that's...
That's not what I thought you was going to say.



Are you joking?
Certainly not.



It's embarrassing
enough they spend



one night on
dai's floor, Maureen.



From here on in
the hosting committee's



going to bloody
well start hosting.



I'm sorry, not me.
I'm concerned about aids.



What?



It's not a trivial matter, sian.
They've issued leaflets.



I don't mind
taking more, hefina.



Not the lesbians so much
because of their cuisine.



But I'll take an extra gay.



I tell you something right now,
Maureen Barry,



if you get aids, so help me God,
I'll nurse you myself.



Though how you're going to get aids
from a couple of sleeping bags



in your extension, I don't know.



Listen, it's fine.



No. I can take another one
and so can cliff.



Think it's going to be
that easy, do you?



You just bulldoze
the whole village



into thinking
the same thing as you.



I don't need to bulldoze anyone.



It's you who's got the problem.



They're all in there
getting along perfectly well.



Oh, really?



What the hell do you
think you're doing?



I'm just talking to
kev about something.



You can talk to kev
any day of the week.



Get over there and find
a gay or a lesbian right now.



Look, hefina, I've shaken their hands.
I've bought them a pint, see?



I don't want to
labor the point, do I?



I might, you know,
give them the wrong impression.



Right.
Oh, right.



Because you're so bloody irresistible,
is that it, Carl Evans?



Listen to me.
I've seen you dancing



round my back yard
with no clothes on



since you were this high.



And I can tell you right now,
these gays have thrown better away.



Now, move yourself. And you.

God, I miss disco.



Everyone back to mine
for a nightcap.



What? Go to bed, cliff.



I promise I'll do it, man.



For God's sake.
He always gets like this.



What did I
bloody say to you, eh?



Showing us up in
front of our guest.



Don't worry.
You're going to love it.



Cheers, mate.



Oi. What the hell
was that about?



He's going to give him dance lessons.
Are you joking?



You'll start
prancing about like that?



Listen, if you're going to spend
the rest of your life



standing at the bar wishing you could
speak to Debbie Thomas,



that's fine by me.



I'm going to be a woman magnet.



Where the bloody
hell did you get that?



I don't know
why you're so het up.



They're going in the morning.



Well, this strike matters
to you two, does it?



Of course it does.



What do you think people will say
when they hear about this?



We're being
backed up by perverts.



You want people
taking the piss, do you?



Scabs? Coppers?



Calling us all sorts of names?



No.



I know one thing.



Your father would
never have stood for it.



That went well, considering.



Considering?



Sometimes people can surprise you,
that's all I'm saying.



I never had
a problem with it, sian.



Well, I'm glad to hear it,
because this is Joe.



Bye.



And he's going to
be sleeping in our house.



How do?



Nice to meet you.



No need to do the full
Barry white, Martin.



He knows you're heterosexual.



This is fine.



I think we should
take him to the door.



No. Just here, please.



Just drop me here.



All right.
Oh, leave him alone.



Hang on a minute.



What is it?



Got to keep up the fiction.



See you.



Mmm. Was it fun?



It was the best experience
of my entire life.



Making pastry?



You wanna start something,
you start it with me!



Lesbians and gays support the miners.



Thank you.



Let's keep it moving, girls.



Just put it in.



Victory to the miners!



Lesbian and gays support
the miners.



Any donations, sir?



Don't worry about me freezing
to death in Brixton, will you?



Aren't you going
to ring your mum?



What for?
A long-distance queer-bashing?



Hi.



Here you are, love.



Why don't I pretend
to be your girlfriend?



That way you get an alibi and I get to watch
<i>the sound of music.</i>



Come to ours, Steph.
Can I?



Yeah.
<i>Orphans of the storm.</i>



No queen's speech.
No Carols.



Oh, sounds like heaven.



Support the miners.



A very happy

Thank you.

Hello?



<i>Can I speak to Jonathan, please?</i>



Uh, no, he's being creative in the kitchen, I'm afraid.
Uh...



Take a message.



I just wanted to thank him
for his beautiful card.



Homemade, too.



My husband was particularly
impressed with it.



<i>I'll be sure to tell him.</i>



Is that a welsh accent
I can hear?



Uh, oh, maybe. The remnants.



I haven't been home
in a long time so...



<i>Well, we're looking forward</i>



<i>to seeing them
all back here soon.</i>



And wish Jonathan
a happy Christmas



from all of us in dulais,
will you?



<i>Of course.
Of course I will.</i>

<i>The 1:00 news
from the BBC.</i>



<i>The coal board
called a press conference</i>



<i>in near despair today after the collapse</i>
<i>of last night's talks.</i>



<i>The strike entered
its 42nd week.</i>



<i>The union responded
with a renewed attack</i>



<i>on the government's
latest cuts to benefits</i>



<i>for the families
of those on strike.</i>



<i>They're calling it an attempt
by Mrs. Thatcher</i>



<i>to starve the miners
back to work.</i>



<i>Severe weather in england</i>
<i>and wales is set to continue...</i>



Bloody hell.
It's bricked up.



Oh, Jesus.



Let's get the stuff unloaded



and shared out
as fast as possible, yeah?



What the bloody hell am I doing?



Right, come on, then,
you heard him.



There's noises in the village.



Small voices.



Nothing we can't handle but...



They want to go back?



They've been told they'll save
the pits that go back first.



They won't but, uh, desperate people,
they'll believe anything.



Tell him about the bus.



Our bus has broken down.



And our gas
has been cut off, so...



We're having baths next door.



<i>We're playing for
a tin of beef now.</i>



<i>Remember, all your proceeds
to the strike fund,</i>



<i>ladies and gents,
so please dig deep.</i>



There's a pair for you.
Happy Christmas.



There you go.



Not even Kim wilde's
got them in orange.



Ah...



This is gethin.
Ah.



Hello.



He's a little nervous.



Jonathan.



There's no need
to be nervous, boy.



With a good
welsh name like that?



Where are you from, then?



Rhyl, originally.



No. No way.



Listen here, see.



We don't mind the gays
and the lesbians, that's fine.



But don't you dare be bringing people
from north wales down here.



Stupid bugger.



That bus is a lifeline.
It takes them into the picket.



It takes the food parcels
to the remotest villages.



Without it...



<i>All the fours, 44.</i>



We need to start thinking
in larger chunks of money



because without it they're going to fail,
it's as simple as that.



I'm sorry,
but when are you going



to address my question
about a women's group?



<i>Blind 70.</i>



Stella, this is important.



I know.
But this group has absolutely no Democratic process.



What do you need
a women's group for, anyway?



<i>Thee and me, 23.</i>



To address the women's issues.



Singly and in
a safe environment.



What is unsafe
about this environment?



<i>Kelly's eye, number one.</i>



I'm a woman, Mike.
Okay?



I'm also a lesbian
and a feminist.



Listen, love, I don't care
if you're Arthur scargill.



Don't talk during the bingo.



<i>Tickety-boo, 62.</i>



<i>¶ Drink to me

Thirty-six.



For God's sake, leave him alone.



He's not a girls' world.



But we love him, mum.



Okay. Design speed.



It's called
the great Atlantic fault.



And, uh,
and it starts here in Spain



and then it goes
under the bay of biscay



and then it comes
up in South wales.



And then it goes under the Atlantic
for Miles and Miles and Miles



and it comes up
again in Pennsylvania.



My father used to talk about it.



And mine.



The dark artery.



That's it. Yeah, that's it.



And you could take a miner



from wales or Spain or America



and you could show them that seam
and they would recognize it.



There's no other coal like it.
It's perfect. Pure.



I lost my younger
brother to that pit.



Thirty-six years old.



But without it, these villages
are nothing, they're finished.



That's what I'd say



if I ever came face-to-face
with Margaret fucking Thatcher.



That's what I'd tell her.



The pit and the people
are one and the same.



Yeah. Well...



Welcome home, son.
Thank you.



Mmm.



Listen to me, everyone.
I just want to say something.



Get your feet off those seats.



- We've let you down.
- No.



No, we have.
We haven't collected enough.



We haven't raised enough awareness.
We know that.



Now, it's not enough
to always be defending.



Sometimes you have to
attack to push forward,



and that's exactly
what we're going to do.



When we get back to London,
and you have my word on this,



we are going to...



We're going to do
something so spectacular.



It'll be so incredible,



so effective,
that the national coal board,



I promise you this,



will come crawling
on their hands and knees



In full drag,



to beg you for forgiveness.



Now, victory!
Victory to the miners!



Well done.
Whoo!



Victory to the miners!

What are you talking about?



From all your bloody queers.



What the hell's going on?



There's normal people who wanna



drink in here as well, you know?



You listen to me.
Those people in there are our guests.



Yeah? Well,
they wanna watch themselves.



Leave it, Martin.
Come on, for God's sake, man.



Come on, leave it.



Come on, Martin.

- Yeah, over here.

Yeah, well, we do now, yeah.



Something big. An event.



Something bigger
than we've ever tried before.



Why don't you come inside?
It's a fraction warmer.



It's morale.
That's the thing.



It's just as important as money.
We need to keep them up, Mike.



Because the minute they start to feel
like a lost cause...



I know. I know.



And there's nothing worse
than a lost cause.

and I wish you as many

And as happy.



Jesus, I'm pissed.



Alan, no!



Give us a hand, will you, Steph?



He's thrown up again.
Margaret, I am so sorry.



Alan pritchard, so help me.



"For many years now

"Any society that accepts

Well, they want to see

Just for a minute.



I think if you met
one or two of them...



Have you seen this, cliff?
About the gays?



I don't believe
what they say about us, Lee.



Why should I listen
to what they say about them?



Get inside, you.
And shut up.

Thanks.



Hello?



I'm in a phone box
so I'll have to be quick.



I got a story
for your news desk.



Hello, mum.



Bye, bromley.



See you.



Hello, sailors.



Morning, ladies.



Come on, maries.
What are they going on about?



With your bum chum.



- What's going on?
- Wait till you see this.



Jesus.



<i>"Perverts support the pits.</i>



"A gaggle of gays
and lesbians has 'come out'



"in favor of the miners' strike.



"Our editor says,



"'we knew
the miners were desperate,



"'but now we have the final
and compelling evidence



"'that they are finished.'"



"does anyone else hear the bottom
of the barrel being scraped?



"From where I'm sitting,
the noise is pretty deafening."



Unbelievable.



Who did this?



It'll have to go to a vote.



But I'm warning you, we can do
without this kind of trouble.



This isn't trouble, it's mischief.
Jesus, man.



We've had worse
than this before now.



Every day they're
out collecting for us.



It's the men, dai.



They've already got their wives
supporting them, and now this.



Gays. The whole country
laughing at us.



It's about dignity.



It'll have to go to a vote.



Right.



They're calling an emergency meeting.
A vote.



Dai's speaking up for us, of course,
but it's done a lot of damage.



Yeah, but we're not going
to let a little thing like this break...



Down! Get down!



What's going on?



Bastards!



I don't care about what they do,
but it's a distraction.



It's distracting people
from the strike.



And then there's the children.



I mean,
what example is it for kiddies



to have gays
and lesbians roaming around?



It's unnatural.



There used to be a tradition in wales
of honoring your guests.



Do you remember that, ladies?



Respect? Generosity?
Hefina...



There's only one
thing that's unnatural



about this whole
bloody business.



Betraying the community.



And when I find out who sold that story,
believe me,



they'll know what it feels like
to be ashamed.



What the hell are we doing?



Now, let's just get
this finished, mark.



No, no, I mean,
what the hell are we doing?



They would never have known we were here
if it wasn't for this article.



So?
So they would never have found us.



So, what are you saying, mark,
I should just send them the bill?



Do you know how many people
read this paper?



This is our chance
to do something spectacular.



We could never drum up this kind



of publicity in a million years.



Mark, don't you just think we ought to
hold back and regroup?



There isn't time to regroup.
This is a news item now.



Today.
We have to take advantage of that.



They called us perverts.
Bromley,



it's time for an important part
of your education.



Hands up in this room
if you've ever been called a name like that.



Now, there is a long and honorable tradition
in the gay community



and it has stood us in good stead
for a very long time.



When somebody
calls you a name...



Am I right about this, Jonathan?



Dead right.



You take it and you own it.

minutes ago, Barry.



Yeah, well, you could

and the difference is this is open to everyone.
Okay?



Gay, straight,
it doesn't matter.



We want people to come together
to show their support.



And why should gay people like me
support the miners?



Because miners dig for coal,
which produces power,



which allows gay people
like you to dance to bananarama



until 3:00 in the morning.



Next question?



Are you all right?



Yes, you. The cute one.



I've never met a pop star.



I have. Max boyce.



He was playing swansea grand
the year our Jane was born.



What's funny about that?



You need to push the t-shirts
and the badges as hard as you can.



This is a fundraiser.
Make sure people are buying stuff.



Is he in charge?



He's the official photographer.



We don't want it to be all churchy.
Do you know what I mean?



It's a christening.



Yeah, but the readings don't all



have to come from the Bible,
do they?



You can have all sorts of things nowadays.



It's more open.



Meeting's tomorrow afternoon.
3:00 sharp.



We'll make it as long
as we leave early enough.



And the vote?



At the end.



Single question,



can we continue taking your support
in the light of recent events?



"Recent events."
Mmm.



You won't have anything to worry about, I'm telling you.



When they see
what you make out of this.



If we make anything out of this.



Are you joking, man?
You're already famous.



Give it here.

"with the mining communities."



Five pounds for a t-shirt, anyone?
Five pounds for a t-shirt.



Don't dawdle, love.
Get indoors.



Support the miners!



<i>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.</i>



<i>To the gays.</i>



<i>To the straights.</i>



<i>And to the as-yet-undecided.</i>



<i>Welcome to the electric ballroom,</i>
<i>Camden, for this,</i>



<i>the first ever pits and perverts benefit ball!</i>



<i>¶ Tell me why</i>



<i>¶ tell me why</i>



<i>¶ contempt in your eyes

<i>¶ Can you tell me why?</i>



This is the first gay club
we've ever been to.



Yeah? As a matter of fact,
we're not gay, either.



Oh.



We're miners.



That's perfect.



Hide me. Hide me.



Hey. Why?



If you see Steph,
perhaps you'd give her this?



They want me to
join their breakaway group,



lesbians against pit closures.



Strictly women only.



I don't think I could trust myself, do you?



Are you going to
take my picture, then?



<i>¶ Can you tell me why?</i>



<i>¶ Can you tell me why?</i>



<i>¶ Can you tell me why?</i>



<i>¶ Can you tell me why? ¶</i>



<i>Well, it's incredible to see such a mix</i>
<i>of people here tonight.</i>



<i>Gay and straight.</i>



<i>Can you see what
we've done here?</i>



<i>By coming together, all of us,</i>



<i>by pledging our solidarity,</i>



<i>our friendship,
we've made history.</i>



<i>Back in our...</i>



<i>Back in our
miners' lodge, in wales,</i>



<i>we have a banner.</i>



<i>And it's old, it's very old.
Maybe 100 years.</i>



<i>And it's this,
two hands together.</i>



<i>Joined like this.</i>



<i>Well, I tell you now,</i>



<i>you've worn our badge,
"coal not dole,"</i>



<i>and when the time comes,
you have my word on this,</i>



<i>we will wear yours.</i>



<i>Shoulder to shoulder.</i>



<i>Hand to hand.</i>



Come on, then, that's right.
We're off out for the night.



I hope you ladies
aren't going to let me down.



What?
We want to see everything!
Don't we?



What, everything?



Even the rubber scene.



<i>¶ You spin me right round, baby</i>



<i>¶ right round

<i>¶ right round, round, round</i>



<i>¶ you spin me right round, baby</i>



<i>¶ right round
like a record, baby</i>



<i>¶ I want your love</i>



<i>¶ I want your love ¶</i>



Sorry, ladies.
This is a men-only venue.



Oh, don't be daft, love.
We've come all the way from powys.



Evening.



Hello.



<i>¶ Blue-eyed dressed
for every situation</i>



<i>¶ moving through
the doorway of a nation</i>



<i>¶ pick me up and shake the doubt</i>



<i>¶ baby I can't do without</i>



how'd you get into
that leotard, then?



Um, talcum powder.



What?



Talcum powder.



Oh. Lily of the valley, I use.



Mark?



Oh, my God.
Mark Ashton.



Tim.



Oh, this is insane.



I'm bumping into
everybody tonight.



How are you?



You still changing the world?



- Bit by bit.
- Tim, come on.



I haven't been home
in four days.



Haven't you?



I'm on a farewell tour.



Where are you going?



You are a beautiful man, mark.



I miss you.



Please take care
of yourself. Okay?



Please.



Come on.



Please take care.



Come on, then, girls.
That's enough.



Back to ours.
Bedtime. Come on.



I'm sorry.
Don't worry.



You're lighter
than your husband.



Mmm.



Do you know what I was
when I met Alan?



Drunk?



Sixteen.



Think that's ridiculous?



I was pretty then.



You're pretty now.



It all goes South, doesn't it?



Love. Looks.
Everything.



That's cheery.



Sod it.



I always thought sex was
for the men, really, anyway.



We just put up with it, don't we?
Keep them quiet.



Okay.



I will listen to a certain amount
of drunken bollocks, Gail,



but sex is not just for the men,



it's for the women, too.
Believe me.



Oh, yeah.



Gail, come on.



No carpets.



This is Laura Ashley.
I've seen it before.



Where?
Cardiff.



What I want to know is...



What's this?



Hefina, you put
that back immediately.



That's nothing.



Here, look what else I've found.



You never went under his bed.



When was the last time
you saw anything like that?



Huh? When? When?



Don't those women ever sleep?



Jesus, God, that takes me back.



Mum.



So, what were
their names again, boys?



Mine was Jess.



And mine was Carol.



Six straight people asked me



if they could
join us last night.



You're joking?
We should set up another group.



Straights supporting gays
supporting miners.



Right, that's it, we're off.



What about bromley?



He's too late.
You've got a meeting to get to.



The vote, remember?



Okay.



Surely you've got
his number, Steph?



Nobody's got his number.
He still lives at home.



I'm sorry, but mark's right.
If we're going to get there by 3:00...



He's blown it.
Come on, let's go.



Oh. What a shame.



He was sucking face
till the lights came up.



I wouldn't waste any time
feeling sorry for him.



Can I please have an aspirin?



<i>What the hell's this?</i>



Plans change, cliff.
It's not my fault.



No answer.



They must be on their way.



Okay.



I can't speak in front
of all these people, cliff.



I can't.



I know you think you know what you want,
Joe, but you're so young.



That's what the law's for,
to protect you.



I didn't know
who I was at your age.



It's such a terrible life, Joe.



It's lonely.



Is that what you want?



No family?



Hiding from people at work,
from everyone?



Keeping secrets?



Come here.



Oh.



<i>So now cliff will speak
on behalf of the lgsm.</i>



The floor's yours, cliff.



Um... w...



Well, what I want to say abo...



About the gays and lesbians...



Why don't you do
us a poem, cliff?



Poem! Poem! Poem!



Poem! Poem! Poem!



I want to propose that
this meeting is unlawful.



I want to propose that this meeting
was brought forward unlawfully



and that most of the people here



aren't even from this village.
All right.



All right.
Let's bring it forward to the vote.



There we go.



Two hours to spare.



Hefina heddon, you drive
like a bloody lunatic.



Oh, Jesus Christ.



Gwen, look after the gays.



Right-o.



3:00.



You can't dictate
when the committee sits.



You told us 3:00.



And then we had to change it.



Bloody disgusting way to behave.



If you weren't up in London...



It's invalid.
This whole decision is invalid.



We can fight it.



We've got one fight, dai.



The fucking strike.



Or have you
forgotten that, all of you?



Dancing around in London.



The trouble with those people
is they jump on the bandwagon.



- What?
- It's well known.



They pretend they're backing you,
but what they're really doing



is pushing their own agenda.



Gay rights.



What?



We've seen articles, hefina.



Christ Jesus help me.



You better shut her mouth
or I'm going to do it permanently.



No, come on, that's enough.



An official letter will be sent.



I can't...
I can't listen to this.



To thank them most sincerely.



But the vote was we won't be accepting
their support any more.



They're causing us embarrassment,
dai, that's the thing.



And we're not
strong enough, not now.



We're struggling
to survive as it is.



Oh, that reminds me.



Courtesy of those people
and their agenda.



Jesus Christ.



I don't suppose you opened
your mouth, did you?



Didn't want to rock the boat,
is that it?



There's bloody thousands here.



You think you've known
someone your whole life.



Turns out they're
a complete stranger.



I'd say the same
about you, cliff.



I'll tell you something.
If you think this is what



my brother would have wanted,
you're wrong.



We came to help you win and if we're
not helping, we have to go.



This was all you.
No.



It was.



All right.
Take my advice.



Don't give it all to the fight.



Save some for home.



There's more to life, you know?



You girls have opened my eyes.



I'm going to extend my repertoire,
you'll see.



The vegan Delia Smith.



Bye.



Bye.



Take care, now.



It's a bloody travesty, man.



- I don't accept it.
- Gethin...



I don't.



They can't stop me from collecting money.
How can they?



- Don't be crazy, gethin.
- Geth...



Somebody better tell
lesbians against pit closures.



What now?



What do you mean?



What are we doing?
Where are we going?
It's over, Mike.



Were you not paying attention?
We lost.



And I don't know about you
but I'm pissing off.



Where?
Anywhere.



I'm out of here.
What about the rest of us?



Do you think it might be possible
that just for once



you could make your
own decision, Mike?



You what?
Do you think that just for once



you could stop following me
around like a fucking spaniel



and let me have
a life of my own?



Yeah.



Yeah, I think I could
manage that, yeah.



Good. Piss off, all of you.
Leave me alone.



Oh, fu...



Lesbians and gays
support the miners.



Lesbians and gays
support the miners.



Lesbians and gays
support the miners.



Never mind the miners.
There's gay people dying every day.



That's what you should
be thinking about.



Not the bloody miners.



Asshole.



Excuse me?



Excuse me?



Excuse me.
I only want to talk to you.



<i>Now, I tell you what we'll do,</i>
<i>let's come over here.</i>



<i>This is the key
you swapped it to.</i>



<i>Oh, well,
we'll leave that there...</i>



<i>Now, just come over here, my son,</i>
<i>and get yourself a nice...</i>



Is Joe there, please?



No, I'm afraid he's out.



Can you tell him that his friend gethin's
in hospital?



It's very important.
He's, um...



He's in St. Thomas' hospital.
He's been beaten up.



Yes, of course I'll tell him.



And will you tell him that Steph



called round to see how he was?



Who was that?



Tina. She wants
a lift in the morning.



You're back at the jobcentre
tomorrow, don't forget.



I should have...



I should have said more.



I could have.
I could have spoken better.



If you're going to cut,
cut it straight.



Triangles.



I'm gay.



I know.



I've known for a little
while now, cliff.



Since the gays arrived?



Well, I can't speak
for the rest of the village



but speaking for myself,
since about 1968.



Well...



Yeah.



What's that?



It's the new van.



About time, too.



What the hell's this?



New van.



Courtesy of our gay friends
down in London.



I'm not getting in that.



Then you'll have to stay here.



In you get, lads.
Quick now.



You a lesbian, are you, love?



That's right.
We're just off to swansea now for a massive lez-off.



<i>Britain's longest running
national strike is over.</i>



<i>Amongst scenes of
bitterness and anger,</i>



<i>num delegates voted narrowly</i>



<i>for an organized return
to work on Tuesday.</i>



<i>Tomorrow most of britain's</i>
<i>coal miners will return to work.</i>



<i>They say they'll march back,
heads held high.</i>



<i>It's almost a year to the very day</i>
<i>since they walked out</i>



<i>and embarked on
a course of action which...</i>



Joe, have you seen the news?



Thank God for that.



Joe?



Bloody hell!



Mark! Where are you going?
I'm leaving.



I was trying to make myself
feel better and I failed.



I've been virtually
under house arrest.



Stuck with my parents.



I haven't seen anyone.



I've tried ringing Steph
but she's always...



Why don't you leave?



I did, last night.



I didn't even tell
them I was going.



That's not leaving,
it's running.



What are you going to do now?



Stay here.



And do what?



And get a job down the pit?



That's all they need, a trained pastry chef
with a camera.



When are you going to
get some guts, huh?



You're a member
of lgsm, bromley.



So stop sneaking
out of your mammy's house



in the dead of night
and stand up for yourself.



Have some pride.



Because life is short, okay?



It's short.



Okay?



What should I tell the others?



Nothing. I wasn't here.



You're a mad bugger.



I'm taking you home after that.



In the van.
No arguments.



Will you give this
to Jeff, please, Joe?



Of course I will.



Come on.



What about gethin?
Is he okay?



Gethin?



The last I heard
he was back on the ward.



I don't like meltis fruits.



Well, then, maybe you won't
go through them quite so fast.



Help me out with these,
will you, bromley?



Stay in bed.



Keep an eye on Jonathan for me,
will you?



He needs to take
care of himself.



It's you we're taking care of,
you daft sod.



If you could just make sure
he's got some groceries in.



Gethin...



He's HIV-positive, sian.



He's not supposed to smoke.
And he needs to eat properly.



Please. For me.



Gethin.



Hello.



This is my mum.



Hello.



Come in.



Back then, when they knew
even less about this thing,



they gave out numbers
with each diagnosis.



One, two, three and so on.



Course, when they got
into the high thousands, it...



I'm number two.



Nobody knows
what's keeping me alive.



I think it's the grass.



What are you going to do now?



Make you some soup.



Drive back to wales.



No, I mean with your life.



I'm a wife and mother, love.



My life goes back to normal now.



Well, it shouldn't.



You've a first-class mind.



You should do something.
Go to college.



Don't waste it, sian.



There are young people
dying every day now.



Good people.



Clever, promising.



Don't you dare waste it.



Oh, shit.



Excuse me.



Sorry.



What the hell is this?
And where have you been?



Hello. You must be
Joe's mum. I'm sian.



Will you please remove your van
from my property?



I hope you appreciate him.



'Cause there's a whole village back in wales



who thinks he's a hero.



Joe.



Mum, he's done this on purpose.



It's all right, I'm leaving.



I hope one day
we can be friends again, mum.



Oi, you got something
to say to your sister?



I've got something to say to you, Jason.
You're a dick.



And Tina, that tight perm doesn't suit you.
It never has.



I'm sorry.



Joe.



Joe.



You all right?



Cheers.



While you've been away, I've been changing my act.
You watch.



Demure and accommodating,
that's me.



The lesbian lady di.



I think I'd find that
a tremendous disappointment.



I'm glad you came back, bromley.



It wasn't the same without you.



Thanks.



I'm glad I came back, too.



If we were normal,
this is when we'd kiss.



There's the rest of it.
Thanks.



"Screw you, Thatcher"
or "fuck you"?



I can see the appeal of both.



Jonathan, "screw" or "fuck"?



"Screw."
It's more visceral.



<i>Attention, attention!</i>



<i>We have reason to believe that there are</i>

<i>A-ha.</i>

yourselves known to me,</i>

Will you please put that down?



We have a very good relationship

<i>Mike.</i>

Just... just get up here

There you go, bromley.



Happy Birthday.



Thank you.



Right. Now, get to work.



And just for future reference...



My name's Joe.



You tell 'em, bromley.



Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!



Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!



Bromley! Bromley!
Bromley! Bromley!



Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!
Bromley! Bromley!



Oi, haven't you heard
about the miners, dearie?



They lost.



Have you heard? No politics.
What?



Mark's over with the steward now.
No politics?



No slogans.



We're a mardi gras, apparently.



There was a general feeling...
Amongst who?



Amongst the committee



that people have become tired of politics
and that this year,



the tone should be celebratory.



With affirmative slogans
and a positive atmosphere.



Horse shit.
If you insist on marching



with your banner,
you'll have to march



at the back with
the fringe groups.



Mate, we're lgsm.
We fought alongside the miners.



Congratulations.
But now it's time for a party.



What?
Bollocks.



<i>Complete and utter bollocks.</i>



What's lgsm's position?



We're going to march.



Yes, but with banners or without?
With.



With. This is
a fucking demonstration.



That's why we've decided to lead the fringe groups
at the back.



Why would you be leading it?
Sorry?



I'm not getting rid of the banner.
Listen...



There's got to be
some kind of compromise.



Why?



Because that's the way
you get things done.



No, it fucking isn't.
Listen.



Why does everything
get so aggressive with you lot?



Listen to me! Listen to me.



Whether we march
with banners or without,



the important thing is that we march together,
all of us.



That's what this whole thing
has been about since the beginning



and that is absolutely
how it is going to end.



Together, us united.



Bloody hell.



Ah, yeah!



I can't believe you're here.



I can't believe you're here.



All right?



Where are my lesbians?
Where are my lesbians?



Hi.
Hey.



Hi!



These are all cucumber.
No butter. Stork sb every one.



I can't believe you came.
Miners, see?



We love a bloody good march.



Right, where do you want us?



You lot.
I'll tell them.



There's too many of you.



What?



You'll have to go to the front.
You'll have to lead.



We're not losing our banners, mate.
What do you mean...



What's he mean, too many?



What's he on about?



I think he means them.



Caerphilly.
West glamorgan.



East glamorgan.
Abercrave lodge.



Aberdare lodge.



Bargoed surface lodge.



Fernhill lodge. Mardy lodge.



Blygrathc lodge.
Cambrian lodge.



Ferniside plant.
Mountain ash lodge.



Dulais valley lodge, onllwyn,



and haverfordwest lodge.



South wales num headquarters.



The gays and lesbians
have been absolutely magnificent,



there's no other word for it.



You must have
found it a bit weird.



A load of gays and lesbians
descending on you like that?



Why on earth would we have
found that weird?



<i>This way, guys.
We're at the front.</i>



<i>Come on, guys.
We're at the front. This way.</i>



Not worried about being too
visible this time?



Shut up and march.
