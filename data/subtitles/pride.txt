00:00:51,816 --> 00:00:56,353
<i>¶ When the union's inspiration through
the workers' blood shall run</i>

2
00:00:56,354 --> 00:01:00,723
<i>¶ there can be no power greater
anywhere beneath the sun</i>

3
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:03,159
<i>¶ yet what force
on earth is weaker</i>

4
00:01:03,161 --> 00:01:05,528
<i>¶ than the feeble
strength of one?</i>

5
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:10,367
<i>¶ But the union makes us strong</i>

6
00:01:10,368 --> 00:01:14,837
<i>¶ solidarity forever</i>

7
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,376
<i>¶ solidarity forever</i>

8
00:01:19,378 --> 00:01:23,746
<i>¶ solidarity forever</i>

9
00:01:23,748 --> 00:01:28,418
<i>¶ for the union
makes us strong ¶</i>

10
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,052
<i>Of unprecedented violence</i>

11
00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:32,421
<i>and with the strike now entering</i>
<i>its fourth month,</i>

12
00:01:32,424 --> 00:01:34,858
<i>the government today insisted
that it will push ahead</i>

13
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:38,427
<i>with plans to close 20 pits with the loss of</i>
<i>over 20,000 jobs,</i>

14
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,063
<i>an action that
Mr. scargill says</i>

15
00:01:40,064 --> 00:01:41,730
<i>will destroy entire communities.</i>

16
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:44,067
<i>You can look back in 10 years</i>

17
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:49,805
<i>and you can say, "in 1984,
I was proud and privileged</i>

18
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:53,210
<i>"to be a party to the greatest</i>
<i>struggle on earth."</i>

19
00:01:53,212 --> 00:01:57,414
I left my number.
Just in case.

20
00:01:57,415 --> 00:02:01,084
<i>Everything's at stake for me.
I'm 27 year old. Right?</i>

21
00:02:01,085 --> 00:02:02,585
Maybe see you on the march,
then?

22
00:02:02,587 --> 00:02:03,753
<i>I'm fighting for their</i>

23
00:02:03,754 --> 00:02:06,989
<i>We've used us savings up,
we've no money left.</i>

24
00:02:06,992 --> 00:02:09,058
<i>All we've got now is us pride
and self-respect</i>

25
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:11,394
<i>and we'll carry on keeping that.</i>

26
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:13,930
<i>The prime minister today
defended her position.</i>

27
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:15,831
<i>I can't change my style.</i>

28
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:18,602
<i>It has to be a style
of firm leadership.</i>

29
00:02:18,603 --> 00:02:20,903
<i>One isn't here to be a softie.</i>

30
00:02:20,906 --> 00:02:23,473
<i>You're here to be a good,
firm leader.</i>

31
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:31,313
Hey, mark,
do you want to play ball?

32
00:02:31,316 --> 00:02:32,414
Tomorrow, buddy.

33
00:02:33,016 --> 00:02:34,183
Here you go, mark.

34
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:35,352
Great. Thanks.

35
00:02:35,353 --> 00:02:37,753
I've spoken to the council
about your deviant parties.

36
00:02:37,756 --> 00:02:40,490
There's no need to do that.
Just knock on the door, we'd let you in.

37
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,459
They're sending a policeman.

38
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:43,759
Oh, I do hope so.

39
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:47,129
Mark.

40
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:48,965
Thanks.

41
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:50,466
<i>The riot squad,</i>

42
00:02:50,468 --> 00:02:52,801
<i>the helmeted policemen
with their plastic shields,</i>

43
00:02:52,804 --> 00:02:55,805
<i>were deployed after smoke bombs</i>
<i>were thrown.</i>

44
00:02:55,807 --> 00:03:00,911
<i>At one stage,</i>
<i>the pickets nearly broke</i>
<i>through the police barricade.</i>

45
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:31,508
Two, four, six, eight!

46
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:33,810
Is that copper really straight?

47
00:03:33,812 --> 00:03:37,212
Two, four, six, eight!
Is that copper
really straight?

48
00:03:37,215 --> 00:03:38,682
Two, four, six, eight!

49
00:03:38,683 --> 00:03:40,984
Is that copper really straight?

50
00:03:40,985 --> 00:03:44,687
Two, four, six, eight!
Is that copper
really straight?

51
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:46,756
Two, four, six, eight!

52
00:03:53,396 --> 00:03:55,497
Oi, grab hold of this,
will you, mate?

53
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:57,700
Oh, no, sorry.

54
00:03:57,703 --> 00:03:59,769
Just for five minutes,
till me friends get here.
Come on.

55
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:02,671
It... it's just that I don't
really want to be too visible.

56
00:04:02,674 --> 00:04:03,840
Is it your first pride?

57
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:05,240
Yeah, first anything.

58
00:04:05,242 --> 00:04:08,110
Yeah, well,
this is the best way.
You need to throw yourself in.

59
00:04:08,112 --> 00:04:09,846
The thing is
is that I'm actually
from bromley.

60
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:12,383
Well, don't worry about that,
we're a broad church.

61
00:04:12,384 --> 00:04:13,584
No, I mean, it's the train.

62
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,051
It's further out
than people think and I...

63
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,420
Oi,
I've been dragging this thing
on me own

64
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,923
since marble arch.
What, are they buckets?

65
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,057
Surprised you have
to ask that question,
Mike, coming from accrington.

66
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,593
Mike, does anything
get rid of love bites?

67
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,528
No. Where's mark now?
Right,
listen up, everyone.

68
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:25,730
Where exactly have you been?

69
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:27,731
I want everyone
to take a bucket
and start rattling.

70
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:29,266
This is for the miners.
Miners?

71
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:30,634
We agreed on a banner, mark.

72
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,069
It's a show of solidarity.

73
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,071
Who hates the miners?
Thatcher.

74
00:04:34,072 --> 00:04:36,574
Who else? The police,
the public and
the tabloid press.

75
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,975
That sound familiar?
Surely, mark...

76
00:04:37,976 --> 00:04:41,278
The only problem we've got
that they haven't
is Mary whitehouse.

77
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,446
And that can only
be a matter of time.

78
00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:44,415
Mark...
I know, it's not been planned.

79
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,057
It's not been thought through
but it's a really
good idea, isn't it?

80
00:04:49,487 --> 00:04:51,389
Isn't it?

81
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:53,591
What am I supposed
to do with this?

82
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:54,959
Give it to the lesbians.
They love a banner.

83
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,159
Oh, for God's sake.

84
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:58,762
Right, looks like you're
off the hook, mate. Good lad.

85
00:04:58,764 --> 00:05:01,899
Whatever
mark says, we do it.
Don't ask me why.

86
00:05:15,646 --> 00:05:17,548
Disgusting.
Yes.

87
00:05:26,324 --> 00:05:30,427
We're collecting
for the miners
and their families, guys.

88
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,165
Gays and lesbians
support the miners
and their families.

89
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:37,300
I was wondering,
do you need a hand?

90
00:05:37,302 --> 00:05:39,670
Well, well, if it isn't bromley.

91
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,038
I mean, my last train
is actually not for ages.

92
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,707
Gays and lesbians
support the miners.

93
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:45,442
Gays and lesbians
support the miners.

94
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:47,110
Gays and lesbians
support the miners.

95
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:48,778
Support the miners.

96
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,213
Guys, support the miners.

97
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,882
Gays and lesbians
support the miners.

98
00:05:52,884 --> 00:05:54,784
- Collecting for the miners.
- Dig deep.

99
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:57,021
Support the miners.
Come on.

100
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,357
Support the miners!
Support the miners!

101
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:08,632
It's just a couple of the lads from college

102
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,500
and one of them lives in chislehurst.

103
00:06:10,502 --> 00:06:13,204
<i>So he can't be too late, either.</i>
<i>I've got my key.</i>

104
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,838
Just mind yourself on that last train.

105
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,639
There's weirdos and all sorts on there.

106
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:20,009
Thanks, mum.

107
00:06:25,817 --> 00:06:30,387
<i>¶ It makes none,
but now you have gone</i>

108
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:34,992
<i>¶ and you must be
looking very old tonight</i>

109
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:40,764
<i>¶ the devil will find work
for idle hands to do</i>

110
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,704
<i>¶ I stole and I lied and why?
Because you asked me to</i>

111
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:50,406
<i>¶ but now you make me
feel so ashamed</i>

112
00:06:50,408 --> 00:06:51,875
Oi, bromley.

113
00:06:51,877 --> 00:06:53,244
Over here.

114
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,552
I'm hiding from that girl.

115
00:07:01,553 --> 00:07:02,853
Why?

116
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,656
She broke my heart
at a smiths concert.

117
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:08,925
I've never met a lesbian before.

118
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:12,362
Really?
I've never met anyone who irons their jeans.

119
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,000
I live at home.

120
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:18,235
No shit.

121
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,870
Is that where you got
that lovely broach?

122
00:07:21,238 --> 00:07:23,374
That's embarrassing.

123
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:25,543
It's today.

124
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,677
What are you, 10?

125
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:29,146
I'm 20.

126
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,548
I wouldn't go
spreading that around.

127
00:07:31,615 --> 00:07:33,417
You're illegal, darling.

128
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:36,120
Sixteen for the breeders,
21 for the gays.

129
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,622
Did you learn
nothing on that march?

130
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,223
You're still a minor.

131
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:42,893
Jesus.

132
00:07:42,894 --> 00:07:44,327
Victory to the minors.

133
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:45,829
Don't make a mess, okay?

134
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:48,298
They've counted it.

135
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,569
Well, come on, you've collected as much as anyone.

136
00:07:52,504 --> 00:07:54,004
Stephanie.

137
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:55,572
Were you with Jeff
in the bell last night?

138
00:07:55,574 --> 00:07:59,576
For fuck's sake. It's a bruise, okay?
My neck is bruised.

139
00:08:01,245 --> 00:08:04,682
No red wine on the floor, please.
Ashtrays.

140
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,617
It was a pretty
good march today.

141
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,819
Not much in the way
of beatings or abuse.

142
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,988
Hardly any petrol bombs
or swastikas.

143
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,690
Is it me or are
the police getting soft?

144
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,394
It's funny.
They've stopped hanging

145
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:17,795
around outside our clubs lately.

146
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:19,997
What's that about?

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,439
Do you think they've finally got sick
of all that Donna summer?

148
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,435
No, never!

149
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:27,872
My guess is they
went somewhere else.

150
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,875
To pick on someone else.

151
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:34,278
My guess is that
while we're enjoying

152
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,649
a temporary reprieve,
they're here.

153
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,552
Giving these poor sods
the shit we usually get.

154
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:45,222
Now, these mining communities
are being bullied just like we are.

155
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:46,825
Right?
Bullied by the police.

156
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,860
Bullied by the tabloids.
Bullied by the government.

157
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,028
Do any of them need a hug?

158
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,530
No. What they need is cash,
and they need it urgently.

159
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,734
Yeah, because the miners have
always come to our aid, haven't they?

160
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,635
Are you fucking kidding me?

161
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,504
Why don't we talk about today?

162
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:04,341
Today, with only a couple of buckets,
we raised nearly 200 quid.

163
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,412
Right, think what we could achieve
if we really started trying.

164
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:08,846
I'm from durham.

165
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:10,715
Well, you know exactly
what we're talking about, then.

166
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,850
I know those bastards
kicked the shit out of me

167
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,820
every morning on
my way to school

168
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,222
and every night on my way home.

169
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:29,267
We are proposing to meet
at least once a week.

170
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,101
And just to do
as many collections as we can.

171
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,471
Oh, and...
And we've got a name.

172
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:37,609
Lgsm.

173
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,245
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

174
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,446
It's not very catchy.

175
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:43,514
It's a support group, Steph,
not a skiffle band.

176
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:45,517
Right, come on.
Let's have a show of hands, shall we?

177
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,351
Who's in?
Guys?

178
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,754
Come on, guys, please.

179
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:52,557
Oh, come on, guys.

180
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,192
Is that it?

181
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,527
We've actually been
looking for things

182
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,461
that we could do together
as a... as a couple.

183
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:58,596
Well, this is perfect.

184
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:00,264
Youse can feed the miners
and your relationship.

185
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,734
How many's that?
That's six.

186
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,735
It's better than five.
Not as good as seven.

187
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,270
Jonathan.

188
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,739
Oh, God.
Here come the gay libbers.

189
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,941
Brilliant party, geth.

190
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,475
I'm sure you could use
the back room here

191
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,110
if you're looking
for a base, that is.

192
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,813
We are... uh, we are.
That's amazing, gethin, thank you.

193
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,481
Well,
what about me and Jonathan?

194
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,717
Or is it exclusively
for the under-25s?

195
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,452
Oh, no, of course not.
Everyone's welcome.

196
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,654
<i>¶ touch me, baby, tainted love ¶</i>

197
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:25,222
are you sure
Jonathan's interested?

198
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:32,730
He's at a bit of a loose end
at the moment.

199
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,633
He just needs something
to occupy him. A project.

200
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:38,068
What about bromley over there?

201
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,337
I've... I've just started
catering college.

202
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,774
Good.
Congratulations, all of you.

203
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:46,977
You're the founder members
of lesbians and gays support the miners.

204
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,980
Terrific.
Let's bring down the government.

205
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,486
Support for the miners.

206
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:56,788
Give generously.

207
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,856
Put your hand in your pockets
for the miners.

208
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,825
Lesbians and gays
support the miners!

209
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,827
<i>National union of mine workers.</i>

210
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,929
Oh, hello.
I represent a group

211
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:08,332
called lesbians and gays
support the miners and...

212
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,202
Hello? Hello...

213
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,142
And there's
the desired consistency.

214
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:19,711
It's glossy and wobbly.

215
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,913
Glossy and wobbly.

216
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,020
Jonathan.

217
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,023
Why don't you go
out with them today?

218
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,323
Because I've got
better things to do

219
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,860
than run around
with a bunch of kids.

220
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,030
What happened to
gay lib, Jonathan?

221
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,700
I don't know.
What did happen to it?

222
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:45,736
Is that gethin's boyfriend?

223
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:48,706
Jonathan. He stabbed
susannah York with an ice pick.

224
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,811
He's an actor.

225
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:53,977
Support the miners.

226
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,681
Lesbians and gays
support the miners, sir.

227
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,582
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

228
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,751
We've raised money and we're looking for
a mining community to...

229
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,320
<i>Repeat the name
of the group, please?</i>

230
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:03,822
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

231
00:12:03,825 --> 00:12:06,024
<i>Somebody will call you back</i>
<i>in due course.</i>

232
00:12:06,027 --> 00:12:08,927
Sure,
but you've said that before and we...

233
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,232
They'll call back.

234
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,336
They will.

235
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,306
Mark, face it.

236
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:21,740
They're on strike.
They're busy.

237
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,341
They don't want to take our money
because we're poofs.

238
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:25,344
And a dyke.
They'd rather starve.

239
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:27,178
Maybe we should just
hand the money over anonymously.

240
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:28,713
I mean, we don't have to
say we're gay, do we?

241
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:29,782
No.

242
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:30,850
Well, at least then
we'd be helping.

243
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,384
No, this is a gay
and lesbian group

244
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,720
and we are unapologetic
about that.

245
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,422
Jesus, why are you even
wasting time with all this?

246
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,090
Mark.
They will call us back.

247
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,557
It has nothing to do with the fact that we're poofs.

248
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,259
And a dyke.
They will call us back.

249
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,861
End of meeting.

250
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,599
They're never
going to call us back.

251
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,000
Someone needs to go with him.

252
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:50,870
First rule of the group.

253
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:51,971
I'll go.

254
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:53,272
Thank you, Steph.

255
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:56,642
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

256
00:12:56,644 --> 00:12:58,644
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

257
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,078
Pervert!

258
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:03,948
First rule of the group, comrade.
Nobody collects alone.

259
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,652
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

260
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,422
Lesbians and gays support...

261
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:11,590
Gethin.

262
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,057
Gethin, come on.
You're supposed to be a bookshop.

263
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:14,894
We don't have maps, mark.
It's a gay bookshop.

264
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:17,096
People ask for the poems
of Walt Whitman.

265
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,230
I hope there's a good reason why

266
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:21,966
Let me just get this right,
so we are going to pick a mining town

267
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,436
completely at random
and just ring it, is that the plan, is it, mark?

268
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:25,638
Yeah, the town hall,
the council.

269
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,772
What, it's as easy as that?

270
00:13:26,774 --> 00:13:29,107
Why not?
We bypass the union all together.

271
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,808
I think it's inspired.
So do I.

272
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,043
See? Even bromley agrees.

273
00:13:32,046 --> 00:13:33,245
Right, here we go.

274
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:37,015
A-ha.
So, what do we want? Um...

275
00:13:37,018 --> 00:13:38,584
Somewhere north...
Industrial?

276
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:40,119
Humberside. Is...
Is that a place?

277
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,453
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Give it to me.

278
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:44,990
If it's miners
you're looking for...

279
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,292
There. Wales.

280
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:47,525
Of course.

281
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:49,495
That's a big fucking coalfield.

282
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,397
That's the brecon beacons.

283
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,135
That's a coalfield, there.
And that is.

284
00:13:57,138 --> 00:13:58,537
All right, and what are we supposed to do?

285
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,139
Stick a bloody pin in it?
Do you know people, gethin?

286
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,441
No, I haven't been
back there in 16 years.

287
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,043
Why not?

288
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,778
Well, let's just say there isn't

289
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,479
always a welcome
in the hillsides.

290
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,115
Shall I get you the phone book?

291
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,684
Well, what's the worst
that can happen?

292
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:15,287
Oh, hello.
I represent a bunch of screaming homosexuals.

293
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:16,721
May I inquire
about your communal baths?

294
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:18,724
What's that got to
do with a strike?

295
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:20,125
Nothing.
I'd just like to inquire.

296
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,331
All right, all right.
Thank you.
All right. Oi!

297
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,933
If we're going to do this, we need to take it seriously.
Come here.

298
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,139
Right.

299
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,975
0-1-9...

300
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,414
What's the welsh for lesbian?

301
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,845
Hello?

302
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:15,813
Yes.

303
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,293
I see.

304
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:32,865
Yes!

305
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:35,868
<i>¶ Solidarity forever</i>

306
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,971
<i>¶ solidarity forever</i>

307
00:15:39,974 --> 00:15:44,442
<i>¶ solidarity forever ¶</i>

308
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:46,144
it really didn't occur to you to get a description?

309
00:15:46,147 --> 00:15:47,712
Well, she were off
the phone that fast.

310
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:49,648
Maybe we should try and look
more obviously gay.

311
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,051
Achievable goals, please, Jeff.

312
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:54,620
- Shut up. That's him.
- Are you sure?

313
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,288
Oh, my God,
he's coming towards us.

314
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,523
How did you know it were him?

315
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:58,758
It's the same as in a nightclub.

316
00:15:58,759 --> 00:15:59,859
It's all in the eyes.

317
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,927
I'm dai Donovan.

318
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:02,595
From the dulais valley.
Right.

319
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:04,129
You must be mark.
Yes, hello.

320
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,197
Hiya. Mike.

321
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,265
Steph.

322
00:16:06,268 --> 00:16:07,801
Hello.
Joe.

323
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:09,601
Jeff.
Dai.

324
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:14,139
So, lgsm.
What does that stand for, then?

325
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,011
You get a garbled message
over the phone.

326
00:16:19,014 --> 00:16:20,254
I thought the l was for London.

327
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,750
London something.

328
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:26,286
I never dreamed for a moment
it was l for...

329
00:16:26,288 --> 00:16:27,288
Hi.

330
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:33,092
This money you've raised,
it's all from gays and lesbians?

331
00:16:33,095 --> 00:16:35,562
Mostly, yeah.

332
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:39,865
Right. There we are.

333
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:41,267
This is just the beginning.
Oh?

334
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:43,370
Mmm-hmm.
We've got big plans.

335
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:47,539
Well, I'm not going to pretend I'm not surprised.
You can see that.

336
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:51,510
Truth told, you're the first gays
I've ever met in my life.

337
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:53,379
As far as you're aware.

338
00:16:53,381 --> 00:16:55,648
That's true.

339
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,317
And you're the first miner
I've ever met.

340
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,619
Yeah.

341
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,525
Now, I... I want you
to do something for me.

342
00:17:05,527 --> 00:17:08,961
I want you to go back to your community
and convey my thanks.

343
00:17:08,963 --> 00:17:10,663
My personal thanks.

344
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:12,664
And the thanks
of all the people of dulais.

345
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,402
Yeah, of course we will.

346
00:17:15,403 --> 00:17:16,568
- Won't we?
- Yeah.

347
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,637
Yeah, yeah.

348
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,707
Won't we, mark?

349
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,877
Who fancies a pint?

350
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,684
<i>¶ I'm the shy boy,
you're the coy boy</i>

351
00:17:32,686 --> 00:17:36,423
<i>¶ and you know
we're homosapien, too... ¶</i>

352
00:17:36,424 --> 00:17:38,525
you can have five minutes.
Are you sure about this?

353
00:17:38,527 --> 00:17:40,393
Dead sure.
Yeah, but for dai...

354
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:41,894
Oh, I'm all right, lad.

355
00:17:41,896 --> 00:17:43,363
Trust me, dai,
if you can handle this,

356
00:17:43,365 --> 00:17:45,198
it's going to make
a huge difference.

357
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,000
What's he going to do,
take his clothes off?

358
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:49,269
I'm just going to say thank you.

359
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,336
Well, don't blame me
if you get bottled.

360
00:17:57,546 --> 00:18:00,380
<i>Right, shut up, you fuckers.</i>

361
00:18:00,382 --> 00:18:02,248
Ooh...

362
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,585
<i>Thank you. Right, listen.
Some of you know me.</i>

363
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:08,054
<i>My name is mark Ashton.</i>
Commie!

364
00:18:08,056 --> 00:18:10,190
<i>I'm going to invite somebody
onto the stage now</i>

365
00:18:10,192 --> 00:18:13,726
<i>who wants to talk to you and I want you</i>
<i>to listen to him.</i>

366
00:18:13,728 --> 00:18:18,631
<i>He comes from the dulais valley</i>
<i>in South wales and he, um...</i>

367
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:21,233
<i>Well, he's a striking miner</i>

368
00:18:21,236 --> 00:18:23,769
<i>and he has something
he wants to say to you.</i>

369
00:18:31,313 --> 00:18:32,811
<i>I've had a...</i>

370
00:18:34,882 --> 00:18:39,818
<i>I've had a lot of new experiences</i>
<i>during this strike.</i>

371
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,087
<i>Um, speaking in public.</i>

372
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:44,223
<i>Standing on a picket line.</i>

373
00:18:45,092 --> 00:18:47,460
<i>And now I'm in a...
A gay bar.</i>

374
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,628
Well, if you don't like it,
you can go home.

375
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:53,665
<i>As a matter of fact,
I do like it.</i>

376
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:55,268
Ooh.

377
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:56,769
<i>Beer's a bit expensive, mind.</i>

378
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:01,941
<i>But really,
there's only one difference</i>

379
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:04,978
<i>between this and a bar
in South wales.</i>

380
00:19:05,846 --> 00:19:07,247
<i>The women.</i>

381
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:10,415
<i>They're a lot more
feminine in here.</i>

382
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:18,057
<i>What I'd really like to say
to you tonight is thank you.</i>

383
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,829
<i>If you're one of the people that's put money</i>
<i>in these buckets,</i>

384
00:19:23,832 --> 00:19:27,200
<i>if you've supported lgsm,
then thank you,</i>

385
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:34,507
<i>because what you've given us is more than money,</i>
<i>it's friendship.</i>

386
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,210
<i>And when you're in a battle</i>

387
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:42,682
<i>against an enemy so much bigger,</i>
<i>so much stronger than you,</i>

388
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:46,552
<i>well, to find out you had a friend</i>
<i>you never knew existed,</i>

389
00:19:48,322 --> 00:19:51,190
<i>well, that's the best feeling
in the world.</i>

390
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:53,026
<i>So, thank you.</i>

391
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:06,373
<i>¶ When two tribes go to war</i>

392
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,476
<i>¶ a point is all
that you can score ¶</i>

393
00:20:09,478 --> 00:20:11,377
oh, my God.
I haven't even finished this one.

394
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:14,601
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

395
00:20:16,217 --> 00:20:18,318
Support the miners.

396
00:20:19,587 --> 00:20:21,154
So you're the only girl?

397
00:20:21,156 --> 00:20:23,891
That's right.
I'm the l in lgsm.

398
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:30,130
Good speech.

399
00:20:30,132 --> 00:20:31,565
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

400
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:34,367
I've worked a few
tough crowds myself over the years.

401
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:36,069
In politics?
In panto.

402
00:20:36,072 --> 00:20:37,171
Oh, right.

403
00:20:37,173 --> 00:20:38,605
Okay, lgsm, over here, please.

404
00:20:38,607 --> 00:20:40,173
That's something else we could use.
What's that?

405
00:20:40,175 --> 00:20:41,709
An official photographer.

406
00:20:41,711 --> 00:20:44,010
Jesus, mark.
We don't even have an official typewriter.

407
00:20:44,012 --> 00:20:45,244
Nice and close, please.

408
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:46,413
I could do it.

409
00:20:46,414 --> 00:20:47,681
I've got a camera.

410
00:20:47,682 --> 00:20:49,383
It's a really good one.
I'd be happy to do it.

411
00:20:49,384 --> 00:20:50,851
All right, bromley,
if you're sure.

412
00:20:50,853 --> 00:20:52,286
Course he's sure.

413
00:20:52,288 --> 00:20:55,556
Never let it be said that lgsm
discouraged youth enterprise.

414
00:20:55,557 --> 00:20:57,124
Right, then.
What are you going to say, "cheese"?

415
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,959
Victory to the miners!

416
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:01,428
Victory to the miners!

417
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:13,473
Martin, come on.

418
00:21:14,643 --> 00:21:16,777
Tell them you've run
a whole canteen before.

419
00:21:16,778 --> 00:21:18,178
You're not just
packing food parcels.

420
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,579
Go.

421
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:20,980
And don't look
so bloody worried.

422
00:21:20,982 --> 00:21:23,049
It's not
the first day of school.

423
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:39,900
What do they need to come here for?
We sent them a thank-you note.

424
00:21:39,902 --> 00:21:41,602
Every other support group
has been invited.

425
00:21:41,604 --> 00:21:43,002
Every other support group was

426
00:21:43,005 --> 00:21:44,337
approved by the whole committee.

427
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:45,705
Oh, I see.

428
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,007
Dai had to make a snap decision.

429
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:48,608
This is all my fault.

430
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:49,809
He was in London, Maureen.

431
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:51,310
What would you have done?
Told them to keep their money?

432
00:21:51,313 --> 00:21:52,578
I'll tell you exactly
what I would have done...

433
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,181
But they raised the money.

434
00:21:54,182 --> 00:21:55,749
All right,
I run a civil meeting here.

435
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,484
If you want to
scream and shout,
get on the pickets.

436
00:21:58,487 --> 00:22:02,522
I don't have a problem
with what they are.

437
00:22:02,525 --> 00:22:03,790
None of us do.

438
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:04,991
It's the men.

439
00:22:04,993 --> 00:22:06,894
Well, you bring a load of gays

440
00:22:06,895 --> 00:22:08,862
into a working men's club,
you get trouble.

441
00:22:08,864 --> 00:22:09,930
I'm sorry.

442
00:22:09,932 --> 00:22:11,699
No other group
has raised as much money.

443
00:22:11,701 --> 00:22:12,965
I'm not disputing that.

444
00:22:12,968 --> 00:22:14,201
Or been so consistent.

445
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:16,836
Then why don't you
just invite them?

446
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,473
I'm sorry, but everyone's saying
they don't have a problem.

447
00:22:20,476 --> 00:22:23,711
Good, they've raised the most money,
so invite them.

448
00:22:23,712 --> 00:22:25,712
And who the bloody hell are you?

449
00:22:27,382 --> 00:22:29,450
- You did what?
- I know.

450
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:33,686
But hefina, she's like the head honcho,
absolutely terrifying,

451
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:36,022
well, she obviously
can't stand this Maureen.

452
00:22:36,025 --> 00:22:38,025
Kids, mind the fish fingers.

453
00:22:43,698 --> 00:22:46,333
What's the matter?
You told me not to sell myself short.

454
00:22:46,335 --> 00:22:49,302
I'm not talking about that.
Gays and lesbians!

455
00:22:49,305 --> 00:22:50,837
We're trying to
fit in here, sian.

456
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:51,904
What?

457
00:22:51,906 --> 00:22:54,374
Volunteer, I said.
Run the canteen.

458
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:55,843
They didn't want me
on the canteen.

459
00:22:55,845 --> 00:22:57,243
They wanted me on the committee.

460
00:22:57,246 --> 00:22:59,480
All right, so keep your head down.
Do the paperwork.

461
00:22:59,481 --> 00:23:01,414
Don't start stirring it all up,

462
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:03,317
inviting a load of
gays and lesbians.

463
00:23:03,318 --> 00:23:05,184
Oh, it's like that, is it?

464
00:23:05,186 --> 00:23:06,619
You know, I had you down as many things

465
00:23:06,622 --> 00:23:07,988
but prejudiced was
never one of them.

466
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,589
I'm not prejudiced.
No?

467
00:23:09,592 --> 00:23:12,692
I'm a realist.
I know what small towns are like, sian.

468
00:23:12,694 --> 00:23:14,827
And I know exactly how those lads
are going to react.

469
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:16,329
You think so?
I know so.

470
00:23:16,332 --> 00:23:19,900
I'm standing on a bloody picket
with them day after day.

471
00:23:19,902 --> 00:23:24,070
It was a majority decision.
The committee decided.

472
00:23:24,073 --> 00:23:26,073
Well, I hope you
and your bloody committee

473
00:23:26,075 --> 00:23:29,476
can guarantee their safety, sian,
I do, I really do.

474
00:23:35,784 --> 00:23:37,683
All aboard the deviants bus.

475
00:23:37,685 --> 00:23:40,721
No pushing,
no community singing.

476
00:23:40,722 --> 00:23:45,192
And absolutely
no back-chatting the driver.

477
00:23:45,193 --> 00:23:46,393
Right, where are we going?

478
00:23:46,394 --> 00:23:47,493
Wales.

479
00:23:48,962 --> 00:23:52,599
Fuck me.
Someone better roll me a little spliffette.

480
00:23:52,602 --> 00:23:56,237
What I'd like to know is
what bromley told his mum and dad.

481
00:23:56,239 --> 00:23:57,438
Yeah.

482
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,740
I just...
Oh, it's no big deal.

483
00:23:58,741 --> 00:24:00,474
Come on.

484
00:24:00,477 --> 00:24:02,743
I said that
I was doing so well at college

485
00:24:02,746 --> 00:24:04,979
they were sending me
on a residential course.

486
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,815
Doing what?

487
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:09,917
Choux pastry.

488
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,821
Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!

489
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,891
Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!

490
00:24:16,893 --> 00:24:19,560
Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!

491
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:40,013
Bit late in the day
for that, isn't it?

492
00:24:40,016 --> 00:24:41,849
That's the fourth one I've done.

493
00:24:41,852 --> 00:24:43,984
Fast as I put them up,
they pull 'em down.

494
00:24:43,987 --> 00:24:46,153
I'm running out of staples.

495
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:06,807
<i>¶ Every woman is
a lesbian at heart</i>

496
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:10,044
<i>¶ every woman is
a lesbian at heart... ¶</i>

497
00:25:10,046 --> 00:25:12,680
you can't possibly say
that every woman is a lesbian.

498
00:25:12,948 --> 00:25:14,182
Why not?

499
00:25:14,183 --> 00:25:15,415
'Cause they're not.

500
00:25:15,417 --> 00:25:17,986
Esther rantzen isn't a lesbian.
My mum's not a lesbian.

501
00:25:17,988 --> 00:25:19,820
How do you know?

502
00:25:19,823 --> 00:25:21,055
How do I know my mum's
not a lesbian?

503
00:25:21,057 --> 00:25:23,625
What he's trying
to say is you can't

504
00:25:23,626 --> 00:25:26,126
make grand,
sweeping generalizations.

505
00:25:26,128 --> 00:25:27,929
It's not acceptable.

506
00:25:29,698 --> 00:25:33,534
<i>¶ Every woman is
a lesbian at heart</i>

507
00:25:33,536 --> 00:25:37,238
<i>¶ every woman is
a lesbian at heart</i>

508
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,375
<i>¶ every woman is
a lesbian at heart</i>

509
00:25:40,376 --> 00:25:44,311
<i>¶ including Reggie's mum ¶</i>

510
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:50,811
Look at the map.
We should have turned left at that village.

511
00:26:50,814 --> 00:26:53,294
How can that be a village?
It doesn't have any vowels.

512
00:26:57,752 --> 00:27:00,320
- Hang on a minute.
- Yes?

513
00:27:01,155 --> 00:27:02,723
I think so.

514
00:27:02,726 --> 00:27:04,192
Are we here?

515
00:27:05,294 --> 00:27:06,728
We're here.

516
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,567
Oh, my God.

517
00:27:15,503 --> 00:27:17,137
Come on, let's go.

518
00:27:40,095 --> 00:27:42,329
Right, then.

519
00:28:00,616 --> 00:28:01,784
I guess we just...

520
00:28:01,786 --> 00:28:04,685
I think I'm starting
to freak out slightly.

521
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,761
Dai, your gays have arrived.

522
00:28:25,174 --> 00:28:26,340
Good to see you again.

523
00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:27,576
Good to see you.

524
00:28:27,577 --> 00:28:31,180
Hi, there. Welcome. Welcome.
Come on in, everybody.

525
00:28:31,182 --> 00:28:33,301
Great to see you again.
Great to see you again. Hello.

526
00:28:33,516 --> 00:28:35,651
Come on in.

527
00:28:35,653 --> 00:28:38,753
Welcome, everybody.
This is my wife, Margaret.

528
00:28:38,756 --> 00:28:40,088
Hello.
How are you?

529
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:43,558
This is Gail and sian,
who wrote to you.

530
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,828
This is hefina,
who chairs the welfare committee.

531
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:51,066
This is Gwen, and this is cliff,
our club secretary.

532
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:53,701
Um, I'm going to officiate you.

533
00:28:53,703 --> 00:28:55,037
Oh, good.

534
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,641
Hold that and
name here, please...

535
00:28:59,643 --> 00:29:01,143
Mmm-hmm.

536
00:29:01,144 --> 00:29:05,213
And in the corresponding box,
the group or organization you represent.

537
00:29:05,215 --> 00:29:07,382
In this case...

538
00:29:07,384 --> 00:29:08,851
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

539
00:29:08,853 --> 00:29:10,318
Yep. Quite. Absolutely.

540
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:11,886
Thank you.

541
00:29:11,888 --> 00:29:13,454
Thank you very much
for having us.

542
00:29:13,457 --> 00:29:16,758
Now, I'm hoping you can clear something up
for me about lesbians.

543
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:18,393
Not now, Gwen.
It's something I was told

544
00:29:18,394 --> 00:29:19,694
in the covered market

545
00:29:19,696 --> 00:29:21,896
and to be honest with you,
it did surprise me.

546
00:29:21,898 --> 00:29:23,765
Let them get settled
in first, shall we?

547
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,701
Oh.

548
00:29:25,702 --> 00:29:27,001
Now, who's making the speech?

549
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,804
A... a speech?

550
00:29:28,806 --> 00:29:30,204
It's no big deal.

551
00:29:30,207 --> 00:29:32,473
One of you just has to go up on stage
and say a few words.

552
00:29:32,476 --> 00:29:33,842
Just so we know
who you are, like.

553
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:38,713
I'll tell the band to shut up
and we'll push you on.

554
00:29:38,715 --> 00:29:40,749
And welcome, all of you.

555
00:29:41,817 --> 00:29:44,286
To be honest,
I never thought you'd come.

556
00:29:55,498 --> 00:29:58,866
Anybody else feel like
appointing themselves leader?

557
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,171
Didn't think so.

558
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:14,316
<i>¶ Many Miles from home</i>

559
00:30:14,317 --> 00:30:18,186
<i>¶ but I'm walking, walking</i>

560
00:30:18,189 --> 00:30:23,357
<i>¶ walking for you</i>

561
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:28,262
<i>¶ walking for you ¶</i>

562
00:30:36,205 --> 00:30:38,874
<i>now, then, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

563
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:42,344
<i>We're joined once again
by one of our support groups,</i>

564
00:30:43,346 --> 00:30:45,279
<i>lesbians and gays
support the miners.</i>

565
00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:51,552
<i>Will you welcome their spokesman</i>
<i>onto the stage? Thank you.</i>

566
00:30:57,727 --> 00:30:59,493
<i>Thank you, dai.</i>

567
00:30:59,496 --> 00:31:02,463
<i>Thank you, um...
Falling leaves.</i>

568
00:31:05,034 --> 00:31:08,002
<i>Actually, dai Donovan
made a speech at our local pub</i>

569
00:31:08,005 --> 00:31:10,505
<i>and he's a pretty
tough act to follow,</i>

570
00:31:10,507 --> 00:31:14,609
<i>so maybe now is the moment</i>
<i>for my musical tribute to Judy garland.</i>

571
00:31:17,413 --> 00:31:20,949
<i>Look, we raised this money
because we want to help you.</i>

572
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,551
<i>And that's it.</i>

573
00:31:23,554 --> 00:31:27,655
<i>And we'll keep on trying to help you</i>
<i>for as long as you want us to</i>

574
00:31:27,657 --> 00:31:28,890
<i>because we've been through</i>

575
00:31:28,892 --> 00:31:30,692
<i>some of the same things
you've been through.</i>

576
00:31:36,031 --> 00:31:37,865
<i>Listen,
if one in five people is gay,</i>

577
00:31:37,867 --> 00:31:39,835
<i>then one in five miners
must be, too, right?</i>

578
00:31:41,505 --> 00:31:44,307
<i>So that's at least a fifth of you</i>
<i>who's pleased to see us.</i>

579
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:51,847
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Thank you for inviting us here.</i>

580
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:53,449
<i>Thanks.</i>

581
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:00,856
One, two, three, four...

582
00:32:00,858 --> 00:32:05,060
<i>¶ Them falling leaves,
they say that summer's done</i>

583
00:32:05,063 --> 00:32:09,132
<i>¶ the wind and rains,
they say so too</i>

584
00:32:09,134 --> 00:32:13,303
<i>¶ but ain't no winter skies'll
ever shadow the sun</i>

585
00:32:13,305 --> 00:32:15,270
<i>¶ while I'm with you ¶</i>

586
00:32:15,272 --> 00:32:16,372
night, everybody.

587
00:32:16,374 --> 00:32:17,440
Goodnight, dai.

588
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:31,788
There we are. All settled in.

589
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:36,392
It's teething problems, love.

590
00:32:36,394 --> 00:32:38,661
Everything will be all right
once they start to mix.

591
00:32:52,843 --> 00:32:54,676
I'm not talking
about running away.

592
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:57,947
I'm talking about
making a dignified exit.

593
00:32:57,949 --> 00:32:59,348
Tomorrow before dawn?

594
00:32:59,351 --> 00:33:00,682
We can't just waltz
into a town like this

595
00:33:00,684 --> 00:33:01,983
and expect them not to...

596
00:33:01,986 --> 00:33:03,118
Slit our throats?

597
00:33:03,121 --> 00:33:04,186
Just be cautious.

598
00:33:04,189 --> 00:33:05,520
I don't know about anybody else

599
00:33:05,522 --> 00:33:07,856
but I don't have to travel to wales
to get my head kicked in.

600
00:33:07,858 --> 00:33:09,625
I can very easily
get that at home.

601
00:33:09,626 --> 00:33:11,361
Anyone who wants
to go should go.

602
00:33:11,363 --> 00:33:13,429
But I came here to help.
Yeah, but they don't want your help.

603
00:33:13,431 --> 00:33:15,431
Well, they can tell
me that to my face.

604
00:33:15,432 --> 00:33:17,366
Until that time,
I'm a member of lgsm

605
00:33:17,368 --> 00:33:19,268
and I'm going to do
what I set out to do.

606
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:22,704
No hiding, no running away,
no apologies.

607
00:33:22,707 --> 00:33:23,905
Me, too.

608
00:33:23,907 --> 00:33:25,040
Yeah.

609
00:33:25,042 --> 00:33:26,241
And me.

610
00:33:26,243 --> 00:33:27,410
And me.

611
00:33:34,218 --> 00:33:36,519
This is a welsh castle, mind.

612
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,055
None of your Norman rubbish.

613
00:33:39,057 --> 00:33:44,626
According to legend,
the maiden Sabrina came here, see,

614
00:33:44,628 --> 00:33:48,330
and became the goddess
of the river severn.

615
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:49,965
How'd she manage that,
then, cliff?

616
00:33:49,968 --> 00:33:52,167
By drowning.

617
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:55,404
"Sabrina fair
listen where thou art sitting

618
00:33:55,406 --> 00:33:58,074
"under the glassie, cool,
translucent wave"

619
00:33:58,076 --> 00:33:59,808
and so on.

620
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,577
I grew up in northern Ireland.

621
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:05,047
I know all about what happens
when people don't
talk to each other.

622
00:34:05,048 --> 00:34:07,182
That's why I've never understood,

623
00:34:07,184 --> 00:34:09,351
what's the point
of supporting gay rights

624
00:34:09,353 --> 00:34:12,021
but nobody else's rights,
you know?

625
00:34:12,023 --> 00:34:13,889
Or workers' rights
but not women's rights.

626
00:34:13,891 --> 00:34:17,193
It's...
I don't know, illogical.

627
00:34:17,195 --> 00:34:21,496
There's a lodge banner over 100 years old.

628
00:34:21,498 --> 00:34:23,865
We bring it out for special occasions, you know.

629
00:34:23,867 --> 00:34:25,400
I'll show it to you one day.

630
00:34:25,402 --> 00:34:27,335
It's a symbol, like this.

631
00:34:27,338 --> 00:34:29,605
Right? Two hands.

632
00:34:29,606 --> 00:34:32,507
That's what the labor movement means.
Should mean.

633
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,610
You support me, I support you.

634
00:34:34,612 --> 00:34:36,846
Whoever you are.
Wherever you come from.

635
00:34:36,847 --> 00:34:39,347
Shoulder to shoulder.
Hand to hand.

636
00:34:39,782 --> 00:34:41,918
Dai!

637
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:45,755
There they go.

638
00:34:45,757 --> 00:34:48,157
They're bringing them in from London, from Bristol.
All over.

639
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:52,061
They're pulling the lads in for anything now.

640
00:34:52,063 --> 00:34:53,528
Well, they can't do that.

641
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:56,532
There's two from my street in custody right now.
Lee and Carl.

642
00:34:56,534 --> 00:34:58,467
Where's your humanity?

643
00:34:58,469 --> 00:35:01,369
We're citizens of this country, mind.
Citizens.

644
00:35:01,371 --> 00:35:03,873
No, I mean, they can't do that.

645
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:05,942
It's totally illegal.

646
00:35:07,478 --> 00:35:08,945
A police officer has
the right to stop you

647
00:35:08,947 --> 00:35:10,612
if, and that's
the important word here,

648
00:35:10,614 --> 00:35:12,280
if he has reasonable grounds to believe

649
00:35:12,282 --> 00:35:13,882
a crime is going
to be committed.

650
00:35:13,885 --> 00:35:15,751
Now, you're absolutely
sure about this?

651
00:35:15,753 --> 00:35:17,820
Police harassment, dear.
I could set it to music.

652
00:35:17,822 --> 00:35:19,054
And if he does?

653
00:35:19,056 --> 00:35:20,489
Then he must formally charge you

654
00:35:20,492 --> 00:35:21,891
within 24 hours of that arrest.

655
00:35:21,893 --> 00:35:23,726
But "reasonable grounds"
means concrete evidence

656
00:35:23,728 --> 00:35:25,661
that can stand up in court.

657
00:35:25,663 --> 00:35:27,896
It doesn't mean he doesn't like
the look of you.

658
00:35:27,898 --> 00:35:29,965
That's the same whether you're standing
on a picket line

659
00:35:29,967 --> 00:35:33,235
or trolling down clapham high street in full drag.

660
00:35:33,237 --> 00:35:35,304
Hefina,
tell Martin to mind the kids.

661
00:35:35,306 --> 00:35:36,940
Where you going?

662
00:35:36,942 --> 00:35:38,509
The police station.

663
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,844
She's finding her feet.

664
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:43,514
Right, gentlemen, listen to me.

665
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:46,782
A police officer only has the right
to detain a group of people...

666
00:35:46,784 --> 00:35:49,018
You need evidence
to stand up in a court of law.

667
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,454
They need concrete evidence.

668
00:35:50,456 --> 00:35:51,822
If you keep them
for longer than 24 hours...

669
00:35:51,824 --> 00:35:54,123
No proof. No proof.

670
00:35:54,126 --> 00:35:57,260
And I will not be leaving this desk until you do.

671
00:36:00,331 --> 00:36:02,733
We've got all day,
so chop-chop.

672
00:36:04,369 --> 00:36:06,469
Nobody said anything
about hiding who we are.

673
00:36:06,472 --> 00:36:08,804
Yes, they did. You.

674
00:36:08,806 --> 00:36:11,208
I just think if everybody
takes it easy on the...

675
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,476
Flamboyance.

676
00:36:12,478 --> 00:36:13,943
Then we're more
likely to fit in.

677
00:36:13,945 --> 00:36:17,947
I'm sorry, just to be clear, when you say flamboyance,
you mean gay?

678
00:36:17,949 --> 00:36:19,882
And when you say everyone,
you mean me?

679
00:36:19,885 --> 00:36:21,385
Jonathan.
Good.

680
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,721
It's just I haven't spoken 1950s in quite a while.

681
00:36:39,503 --> 00:36:41,438
Over here, please.
We're packing parcels.

682
00:36:44,409 --> 00:36:45,775
You'll stay for a pint?

683
00:36:45,777 --> 00:36:47,143
No, you're all right, cliff.

684
00:36:47,146 --> 00:36:50,179
Welfare's had a change of atmosphere,
if you know what I mean.

685
00:36:50,181 --> 00:36:51,547
I don't know what
you mean, Lee, no.

686
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,317
He means these faggots.
Oi.

687
00:36:53,318 --> 00:36:54,885
If it wasn't for
those people over there,

688
00:36:54,887 --> 00:36:56,052
you lot would
still be in the Nick.

689
00:36:56,054 --> 00:36:57,219
What?
He's right.

690
00:36:57,222 --> 00:36:59,056
They make me sick,
that's all I know, dai.

691
00:36:59,057 --> 00:37:00,190
That's enough.

692
00:37:00,192 --> 00:37:01,257
Physically sick.

693
00:37:05,996 --> 00:37:07,264
- Gays?
- From London.

694
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,764
They were the ones, Carl.
They got you out.

695
00:37:08,766 --> 00:37:10,199
I thought sian got us out.

696
00:37:10,202 --> 00:37:13,135
They told her...
They told her what to say.

697
00:37:17,342 --> 00:37:20,077
Carl.
It's you lot, is it?
The gays.

698
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,811
What's going on?

699
00:37:21,813 --> 00:37:23,547
No, it's all right.
It's all right.

700
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:26,882
We're lgsm. Lesbians and gays
support the miners, yes.

701
00:37:26,885 --> 00:37:28,985
My name's mark Ashton.

702
00:37:31,521 --> 00:37:34,090
You'll have a pint,
will you, mark?

703
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:49,539
What I was told about lesbians really did shock me.

704
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:51,608
It can't be true, can it?

705
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,577
You're all vegetarians?

706
00:37:54,612 --> 00:37:57,213
Actually,
Zoe and I are both vegans.

707
00:38:03,387 --> 00:38:07,157
So, you live together like,
you know, husband and wife.

708
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,958
But what I want to know is...

709
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,726
I know what you're going to say.

710
00:38:10,728 --> 00:38:13,996
Which one does the housework?

711
00:38:13,998 --> 00:38:18,402
Oh, well, that's...
That's not what I thought you was going to say.

712
00:38:18,403 --> 00:38:20,403
Are you joking?
Certainly not.

713
00:38:20,405 --> 00:38:21,938
It's embarrassing
enough they spend

714
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,407
one night on
dai's floor, Maureen.

715
00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:24,775
From here on in
the hosting committee's

716
00:38:24,777 --> 00:38:26,108
going to bloody
well start hosting.

717
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:29,746
I'm sorry, not me.
I'm concerned about aids.

718
00:38:29,748 --> 00:38:31,280
What?

719
00:38:31,282 --> 00:38:35,184
It's not a trivial matter, sian.
They've issued leaflets.

720
00:38:35,186 --> 00:38:36,853
I don't mind
taking more, hefina.

721
00:38:36,855 --> 00:38:39,789
Not the lesbians so much
because of their cuisine.

722
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:42,192
But I'll take an extra gay.

723
00:38:42,193 --> 00:38:44,695
I tell you something right now,
Maureen Barry,

724
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:48,197
if you get aids, so help me God,
I'll nurse you myself.

725
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:50,300
Though how you're going to get aids
from a couple of sleeping bags

726
00:38:50,302 --> 00:38:52,601
in your extension, I don't know.

727
00:38:52,603 --> 00:38:53,836
Listen, it's fine.

728
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:56,672
No. I can take another one
and so can cliff.

729
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:06,349
Think it's going to be
that easy, do you?

730
00:39:06,351 --> 00:39:07,684
You just bulldoze
the whole village

731
00:39:07,686 --> 00:39:09,052
into thinking
the same thing as you.

732
00:39:09,054 --> 00:39:10,753
I don't need to bulldoze anyone.

733
00:39:10,755 --> 00:39:12,389
It's you who's got the problem.

734
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:15,692
They're all in there
getting along perfectly well.

735
00:39:19,963 --> 00:39:21,465
Oh, really?

736
00:39:37,715 --> 00:39:39,182
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

737
00:39:39,184 --> 00:39:41,518
I'm just talking to
kev about something.

738
00:39:41,521 --> 00:39:42,887
You can talk to kev
any day of the week.

739
00:39:42,889 --> 00:39:45,489
Get over there and find
a gay or a lesbian right now.

740
00:39:45,492 --> 00:39:49,527
Look, hefina, I've shaken their hands.
I've bought them a pint, see?

741
00:39:49,528 --> 00:39:50,795
I don't want to
labor the point, do I?

742
00:39:50,797 --> 00:39:53,331
I might, you know,
give them the wrong impression.

743
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:55,099
Right.
Oh, right.

744
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:58,034
Because you're so bloody irresistible,
is that it, Carl Evans?

745
00:39:58,036 --> 00:39:59,804
Listen to me.
I've seen you dancing

746
00:39:59,806 --> 00:40:01,539
round my back yard
with no clothes on

747
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:03,074
since you were this high.

748
00:40:03,076 --> 00:40:06,277
And I can tell you right now,
these gays have thrown better away.

749
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,579
Now, move yourself. And you.

750
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,521
<i>¶ Red, gold and green</i>

751
00:40:16,523 --> 00:40:20,925

752
00:40:20,927 --> 00:40:22,726
this is a first, this.

753
00:40:22,728 --> 00:40:25,262
Men on the dance floor.

754
00:40:25,264 --> 00:40:27,197
You can't be serious!

755
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:30,101
Welsh men don't dance,
do they, sian?

756
00:40:30,103 --> 00:40:32,170
Never.
Can't move their hips.

757
00:40:34,106 --> 00:40:37,108
Well, why don't we show them
what they're missing?

758
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:40,378

789
00:42:42,701 --> 00:42:44,467
God, I miss disco.

790
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:57,280
Everyone back to mine
for a nightcap.

791
00:42:57,282 --> 00:42:59,483
What? Go to bed, cliff.

792
00:43:00,251 --> 00:43:01,385
I promise I'll do it, man.

793
00:43:01,387 --> 00:43:04,188
For God's sake.
He always gets like this.

794
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,856
What did I
bloody say to you, eh?

795
00:43:06,858 --> 00:43:08,259
Showing us up in
front of our guest.

796
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,528
Don't worry.
You're going to love it.

797
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:13,697
Cheers, mate.

798
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:15,699
Oi. What the hell
was that about?

799
00:43:15,702 --> 00:43:17,568
He's going to give him dance lessons.
Are you joking?

800
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,769
You'll start
prancing about like that?

801
00:43:19,771 --> 00:43:22,539
Listen, if you're going to spend
the rest of your life

802
00:43:22,541 --> 00:43:24,641
standing at the bar wishing you could
speak to Debbie Thomas,

803
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:25,943
that's fine by me.

804
00:43:25,945 --> 00:43:28,246
I'm going to be a woman magnet.

805
00:43:28,248 --> 00:43:30,148
Where the bloody
hell did you get that?

806
00:43:39,092 --> 00:43:40,726
I don't know
why you're so het up.

807
00:43:40,728 --> 00:43:42,159
They're going in the morning.

808
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,128
Well, this strike matters
to you two, does it?

809
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,664
Of course it does.

810
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:49,233
What do you think people will say
when they hear about this?

811
00:43:49,235 --> 00:43:51,802
We're being
backed up by perverts.

812
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,574
You want people
taking the piss, do you?

813
00:43:55,576 --> 00:43:58,510
Scabs? Coppers?

814
00:43:58,512 --> 00:44:00,177
Calling us all sorts of names?

815
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,278
No.

816
00:44:02,581 --> 00:44:04,849
I know one thing.

817
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:07,918
Your father would
never have stood for it.

818
00:44:15,128 --> 00:44:17,028
That went well, considering.

819
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,864
Considering?

820
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:22,367
Sometimes people can surprise you,
that's all I'm saying.

821
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:24,436
I never had
a problem with it, sian.

822
00:44:24,438 --> 00:44:27,873
Well, I'm glad to hear it,
because this is Joe.

823
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,440
Bye.

824
00:44:29,443 --> 00:44:32,177
And he's going to
be sleeping in our house.

825
00:44:33,612 --> 00:44:34,846
How do?

826
00:44:34,847 --> 00:44:36,047
Nice to meet you.

827
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:40,719
No need to do the full
Barry white, Martin.

828
00:44:40,721 --> 00:44:43,121
He knows you're heterosexual.

829
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,202
This is fine.

830
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:02,574
I think we should
take him to the door.

831
00:45:02,576 --> 00:45:04,041
No. Just here, please.

832
00:45:04,043 --> 00:45:05,277
Just drop me here.

833
00:45:07,213 --> 00:45:09,414
All right.
Oh, leave him alone.

834
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:10,715
Hang on a minute.

835
00:45:16,655 --> 00:45:17,856
What is it?

836
00:45:17,858 --> 00:45:18,989
Got to keep up the fiction.

837
00:45:23,896 --> 00:45:25,097
See you.

838
00:45:31,503 --> 00:45:33,804
Mmm. Was it fun?

839
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,009
It was the best experience
of my entire life.

840
00:45:39,077 --> 00:45:40,612
Making pastry?

841
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:17,047
You wanna start something,
you start it with me!

842
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:18,983
Lesbians and gays support the miners.

843
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:20,117
Thank you.

844
00:46:29,961 --> 00:46:31,463
Let's keep it moving, girls.

845
00:46:31,465 --> 00:46:32,697
Just put it in.

846
00:46:37,603 --> 00:46:39,403
Victory to the miners!

847
00:46:53,954 --> 00:46:55,853
Lesbian and gays support
the miners.

848
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:57,688
Any donations, sir?

849
00:47:00,793 --> 00:47:04,161
Don't worry about me freezing
to death in Brixton, will you?

850
00:47:04,164 --> 00:47:05,829
Aren't you going
to ring your mum?

851
00:47:05,831 --> 00:47:07,831
What for?
A long-distance queer-bashing?

852
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:08,934
Hi.

853
00:47:08,936 --> 00:47:10,202
Here you are, love.

854
00:47:10,204 --> 00:47:11,735
Why don't I pretend
to be your girlfriend?

855
00:47:11,737 --> 00:47:14,806
That way you get an alibi and I get to watch
<i>the sound of music.</i>

856
00:47:14,807 --> 00:47:16,541
Come to ours, Steph.
Can I?

857
00:47:16,543 --> 00:47:18,777
Yeah.
<i>Orphans of the storm.</i>

858
00:47:19,445 --> 00:47:21,079
No queen's speech.
No Carols.

859
00:47:21,081 --> 00:47:22,880
Oh, sounds like heaven.

860
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:24,083
Support the miners.

861
00:47:26,485 --> 00:47:28,521
A very happy
Christmas to you, too.

862
00:47:28,523 --> 00:47:30,690
<i>There is now a danger</i>

863
00:47:30,692 --> 00:47:32,824
<i>that has become
a threat to us all.</i>

864
00:47:32,827 --> 00:47:36,394
<i>It is a deadly disease
and there is no known cure.</i>

865
00:47:37,465 --> 00:47:42,001
<i>Passed during sexual intercourse</i>
<i>with an infected person.</i>

866
00:47:42,003 --> 00:47:43,335
Aids.

867
00:47:43,338 --> 00:47:46,438
Anally injected death sentence.

868
00:47:47,541 --> 00:47:49,976
Will you switch that off,
please, Tony?

869
00:47:49,978 --> 00:47:52,010
<i>But it's spreading.</i>

870
00:47:52,012 --> 00:47:53,980
Thank you.
<i>So protect yourself.</i>

871
00:47:56,684 --> 00:47:57,583
Hello?

872
00:47:57,585 --> 00:48:00,152
<i>Can I speak to Jonathan, please?</i>

873
00:48:00,153 --> 00:48:03,521
Uh, no, he's being creative in the kitchen, I'm afraid.
Uh...

874
00:48:03,523 --> 00:48:04,623
Take a message.

875
00:48:04,626 --> 00:48:06,791
I just wanted to thank him
for his beautiful card.

876
00:48:07,193 --> 00:48:08,327
Homemade, too.

877
00:48:09,596 --> 00:48:12,530
My husband was particularly
impressed with it.

878
00:48:12,532 --> 00:48:14,432
<i>I'll be sure to tell him.</i>

879
00:48:14,434 --> 00:48:17,335
Is that a welsh accent
I can hear?

880
00:48:17,338 --> 00:48:20,338
Uh, oh, maybe. The remnants.

881
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:24,076
I haven't been home
in a long time so...

882
00:48:24,077 --> 00:48:25,344
<i>Well, we're looking forward</i>

883
00:48:25,346 --> 00:48:26,579
<i>to seeing them
all back here soon.</i>

884
00:48:26,581 --> 00:48:28,414
And wish Jonathan
a happy Christmas

885
00:48:28,416 --> 00:48:30,181
from all of us in dulais,
will you?

886
00:48:30,184 --> 00:48:31,684
<i>Of course.
Of course I will.</i>

887
00:48:31,686 --> 00:48:33,251
<i>Nadolig llawen</i> to you, my love.

888
00:48:35,554 --> 00:48:37,523
<i>Nadolig llawen.</i>

889
00:48:45,699 --> 00:48:49,302
<i>The 1:00 news
from the BBC.</i>

890
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:51,637
<i>The coal board
called a press conference</i>

891
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:55,240
<i>in near despair today after the collapse</i>
<i>of last night's talks.</i>

892
00:48:55,242 --> 00:48:57,943
<i>The strike entered
its 42nd week.</i>

893
00:48:57,945 --> 00:49:00,112
<i>The union responded
with a renewed attack</i>

894
00:49:00,114 --> 00:49:02,081
<i>on the government's
latest cuts to benefits</i>

895
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:04,215
<i>for the families
of those on strike.</i>

896
00:49:04,217 --> 00:49:06,719
<i>They're calling it an attempt
by Mrs. Thatcher</i>

897
00:49:06,721 --> 00:49:09,221
<i>to starve the miners
back to work.</i>

898
00:49:09,222 --> 00:49:12,123
<i>Severe weather in england</i>
<i>and wales is set to continue...</i>

899
00:49:13,059 --> 00:49:15,561
Bloody hell.
It's bricked up.

900
00:49:18,297 --> 00:49:20,065
Oh, Jesus.

901
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:40,585
Let's get the stuff unloaded

902
00:49:40,588 --> 00:49:43,389
and shared out
as fast as possible, yeah?

903
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:49,094
What the bloody hell am I doing?

904
00:49:49,097 --> 00:49:51,831
Right, come on, then,
you heard him.

905
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,634
There's noises in the village.

906
00:49:55,635 --> 00:49:57,503
Small voices.

907
00:49:57,505 --> 00:49:58,971
Nothing we can't handle but...

908
00:49:58,972 --> 00:50:01,340
They want to go back?

909
00:50:01,342 --> 00:50:05,210
They've been told they'll save
the pits that go back first.

910
00:50:05,213 --> 00:50:09,581
They won't but, uh, desperate people,
they'll believe anything.

911
00:50:11,351 --> 00:50:13,418
Tell him about the bus.

912
00:50:14,721 --> 00:50:16,621
Our bus has broken down.

913
00:50:16,623 --> 00:50:18,958
And our gas
has been cut off, so...

914
00:50:19,826 --> 00:50:22,193
We're having baths next door.

915
00:50:24,664 --> 00:50:29,001
<i>We're playing for
a tin of beef now.</i>

916
00:50:29,003 --> 00:50:31,971
<i>Remember, all your proceeds
to the strike fund,</i>

917
00:50:31,972 --> 00:50:34,739
<i>ladies and gents,
so please dig deep.</i>

918
00:50:34,742 --> 00:50:37,576
There's a pair for you.
Happy Christmas.

919
00:50:37,577 --> 00:50:39,478
There you go.

920
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,280
Not even Kim wilde's
got them in orange.

921
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:43,349
Ah...

922
00:50:43,351 --> 00:50:44,817
This is gethin.
Ah.

923
00:50:44,818 --> 00:50:46,152
Hello.

924
00:50:46,153 --> 00:50:47,420
He's a little nervous.

925
00:50:47,422 --> 00:50:48,753
Jonathan.

926
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:50,054
There's no need
to be nervous, boy.

927
00:50:50,056 --> 00:50:51,923
With a good
welsh name like that?

928
00:50:51,925 --> 00:50:53,458
Where are you from, then?

929
00:50:54,226 --> 00:50:56,228
Rhyl, originally.

930
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:59,164
No. No way.

931
00:51:00,699 --> 00:51:02,067
Listen here, see.

932
00:51:02,068 --> 00:51:04,603
We don't mind the gays
and the lesbians, that's fine.

933
00:51:04,605 --> 00:51:07,405
But don't you dare be bringing people
from north wales down here.

934
00:51:17,416 --> 00:51:18,985
Stupid bugger.

935
00:51:24,257 --> 00:51:27,059
That bus is a lifeline.
It takes them into the picket.

936
00:51:27,061 --> 00:51:29,528
It takes the food parcels
to the remotest villages.

937
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:31,565
Without it...

938
00:51:31,567 --> 00:51:34,367
<i>All the fours, 44.</i>

939
00:51:34,369 --> 00:51:36,235
We need to start thinking
in larger chunks of money

940
00:51:36,237 --> 00:51:38,271
because without it they're going to fail,
it's as simple as that.

941
00:51:38,273 --> 00:51:39,371
I'm sorry,
but when are you going

942
00:51:39,373 --> 00:51:41,074
to address my question
about a women's group?

943
00:51:41,076 --> 00:51:43,043
<i>Blind 70.</i>

944
00:51:43,045 --> 00:51:44,744
Stella, this is important.

945
00:51:44,746 --> 00:51:48,481
I know.
But this group has absolutely no Democratic process.

946
00:51:48,483 --> 00:51:50,382
What do you need
a women's group for, anyway?

947
00:51:50,385 --> 00:51:51,985
<i>Thee and me, 23.</i>

948
00:51:51,987 --> 00:51:53,552
To address the women's issues.

949
00:51:53,554 --> 00:51:55,489
Singly and in
a safe environment.

950
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:58,257
What is unsafe
about this environment?

951
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,327
<i>Kelly's eye, number one.</i>

952
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:02,295
I'm a woman, Mike.
Okay?

953
00:52:02,297 --> 00:52:05,164
I'm also a lesbian
and a feminist.

954
00:52:05,166 --> 00:52:08,501
Listen, love, I don't care
if you're Arthur scargill.

955
00:52:08,503 --> 00:52:10,402
Don't talk during the bingo.

956
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,907
<i>Tickety-boo, 62.</i>

957
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:24,384
<i>¶ Drink to me
only with thine eyes</i>

958
00:52:27,789 --> 00:52:29,155
Thirty-six.

959
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:31,791
For God's sake, leave him alone.

960
00:52:31,793 --> 00:52:33,092
He's not a girls' world.

961
00:52:33,094 --> 00:52:34,594
But we love him, mum.

962
00:52:35,998 --> 00:52:37,963
Okay. Design speed.

963
00:52:37,965 --> 00:52:41,534
It's called
the great Atlantic fault.

964
00:52:41,536 --> 00:52:46,039
And, uh,
and it starts here in Spain

965
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:48,173
and then it goes
under the bay of biscay

966
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:51,378
and then it comes
up in South wales.

967
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:56,016
And then it goes under the Atlantic
for Miles and Miles and Miles

968
00:52:56,018 --> 00:52:59,619
and it comes up
again in Pennsylvania.

969
00:52:59,621 --> 00:53:00,987
My father used to talk about it.

970
00:53:00,989 --> 00:53:02,688
And mine.

971
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:04,257
The dark artery.

972
00:53:04,259 --> 00:53:05,759
That's it. Yeah, that's it.

973
00:53:06,726 --> 00:53:08,894
And you could take a miner

974
00:53:09,996 --> 00:53:12,798
from wales or Spain or America

975
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,235
and you could show them that seam
and they would recognize it.

976
00:53:16,237 --> 00:53:20,273
There's no other coal like it.
It's perfect. Pure.

977
00:53:24,311 --> 00:53:28,380
I lost my younger
brother to that pit.

978
00:53:28,382 --> 00:53:29,983
Thirty-six years old.

979
00:53:29,985 --> 00:53:34,454
But without it, these villages
are nothing, they're finished.

980
00:53:35,655 --> 00:53:37,590
That's what I'd say

981
00:53:37,592 --> 00:53:41,760
if I ever came face-to-face
with Margaret fucking Thatcher.

982
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:44,898
That's what I'd tell her.

983
00:53:46,233 --> 00:53:48,635
The pit and the people
are one and the same.

984
00:53:51,237 --> 00:53:54,608
Yeah. Well...

985
00:53:58,679 --> 00:54:00,614
Welcome home, son.
Thank you.

986
00:54:00,615 --> 00:54:02,081
Mmm.

987
00:54:20,134 --> 00:54:22,936
Listen to me, everyone.
I just want to say something.

988
00:54:22,938 --> 00:54:24,170
Get your feet off those seats.

989
00:54:27,474 --> 00:54:29,409
- We've let you down.
- No.

990
00:54:29,411 --> 00:54:31,411
No, we have.
We haven't collected enough.

991
00:54:31,413 --> 00:54:34,581
We haven't raised enough awareness.
We know that.

992
00:54:34,583 --> 00:54:36,650
Now, it's not enough
to always be defending.

993
00:54:36,652 --> 00:54:40,552
Sometimes you have to
attack to push forward,

994
00:54:40,554 --> 00:54:42,655
and that's exactly
what we're going to do.

995
00:54:42,657 --> 00:54:45,759
When we get back to London,
and you have my word on this,

996
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,826
we are going to...

997
00:54:47,894 --> 00:54:50,295
We're going to do
something so spectacular.

998
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,500
It'll be so incredible,

999
00:54:53,501 --> 00:54:55,735
so effective,
that the national coal board,

1000
00:54:55,737 --> 00:54:57,103
I promise you this,

1001
00:54:57,105 --> 00:54:59,672
will come crawling
on their hands and knees

1002
00:55:01,175 --> 00:55:02,742
In full drag,

1003
00:55:04,945 --> 00:55:07,746
to beg you for forgiveness.

1004
00:55:07,748 --> 00:55:10,282
Now, victory!
Victory to the miners!

1005
00:55:15,456 --> 00:55:17,625
Well done.
Whoo!

1006
00:55:17,626 --> 00:55:18,893
Victory to the miners!

1007
00:55:19,695 --> 00:55:24,998
<i>¶ As we come marching, marching</i>

Go back to where you came from!

1031
00:57:20,248 --> 00:57:21,949
We've come to take
back our welfare.

1032
00:57:21,951 --> 00:57:23,250
What are you talking about?

1033
00:57:23,251 --> 00:57:24,485
From all your bloody queers.

1034
00:57:24,487 --> 00:57:25,719
What the hell's going on?

1035
00:57:25,721 --> 00:57:27,086
There's normal people who wanna

1036
00:57:27,088 --> 00:57:28,389
drink in here as well, you know?

1037
00:57:28,391 --> 00:57:30,423
You listen to me.
Those people in there are our guests.

1038
00:57:30,425 --> 00:57:32,726
Yeah? Well,
they wanna watch themselves.

1039
00:57:32,728 --> 00:57:34,795
Leave it, Martin.
Come on, for God's sake, man.

1040
00:57:34,797 --> 00:57:36,163
Come on, leave it.

1041
00:57:36,164 --> 00:57:37,431
Come on, Martin.

1042
00:57:37,432 --> 00:57:41,068
You so much as lay one finger
on anyone inside that hall,

1043
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:43,838
and so help me God,
I'll break your bloody arms and legs for you.

1044
00:57:45,106 --> 00:57:46,306
Come on.
Come back in. Come on.

1045
00:57:50,445 --> 00:57:52,045
Bent bastards!

1046
00:57:54,949 --> 00:57:56,150
There you go.
I know it's freezing

1047
00:57:56,152 --> 00:57:58,518
but at least
the beers will be cold.

1048
00:57:58,521 --> 00:58:00,086
- You want a beer, anyone?
- Yeah, over here.

1049
00:58:00,088 --> 00:58:01,822
I've got one, thanks, dai.

1050
00:58:02,456 --> 00:58:04,123
Here you go, Alan.

1051
00:58:04,126 --> 00:58:07,126
"Say not the struggle

1056
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:19,206
Oh, that's more like it.

1057

<i>¶ Maybe you want

1060
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:37,757
I'm Gary.
Oh.

1061
00:58:39,159 --> 00:58:40,527
Hi.

1062
00:58:40,528 --> 00:58:42,528
I want to learn to dance.

1063
00:58:45,967 --> 00:58:47,134
We need to make
something happen.

1064
00:58:47,135 --> 00:58:49,168
Yeah, well, we do now, yeah.

1065
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:51,137
Something big. An event.

1066
00:58:51,139 --> 00:58:55,074
Something bigger
than we've ever tried before.

1067
00:58:55,077 --> 00:58:56,643
Why don't you come inside?
It's a fraction warmer.

1068
00:58:56,646 --> 00:58:58,846
It's morale.
That's the thing.

1069
00:58:58,847 --> 00:59:02,248
It's just as important as money.
We need to keep them up, Mike.

1070
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:04,083
Because the minute they start to feel
like a lost cause...

1071
00:59:04,085 --> 00:59:05,786
I know. I know.

1072
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:20,201
And there's nothing worse
than a lost cause.

1073
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:24,606
<i>¶ In my sleep</i>

1074
00:59:24,608 --> 00:59:29,443
<i>¶ countin' troubles

1075
00:59:30,579 --> 00:59:32,914
I'm in wales

1076
00:59:32,916 --> 00:59:36,251
and I don't have to pretend
to be something that I'm not.

1077
00:59:36,253 --> 00:59:39,119
I'm home. And I'm gay.

1078
00:59:39,121 --> 00:59:40,387
And I'm welsh.

1079
00:59:40,389 --> 00:59:42,157
That's right!

1080
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:45,460
Get him another beer
before he starts singing.

1081
00:59:46,697 --> 00:59:50,331
What I don't understand
is why you never came back before.

1082
00:59:53,702 --> 00:59:55,202
My mother.

1083
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:01,543
She couldn't accept me.

1084
01:00:01,545 --> 01:00:02,744
Not then, perhaps.

1085
01:00:02,746 --> 01:00:05,579
She's religious.

1086
01:00:05,581 --> 01:00:08,115
She hasn't said
one word to me in 16 years.

1087
01:00:08,117 --> 01:00:10,117
And what about you?
What words have
you said to her?

1088
01:00:10,119 --> 01:00:14,889
<i>¶ It's gone away in yesterday</i>

1089
01:00:14,891 --> 01:00:19,561
<i>¶ now I find myself

1090
01:00:21,664 --> 01:00:27,434

01:00:29,806 --> 01:00:31,572
I'm a gobby
northern lesbian, Gwen.

1093
01:00:31,574 --> 01:00:32,740
I tend to scare 'em off.

1094
01:00:34,242 --> 01:00:35,809
Look.

1095
01:00:36,911 --> 01:00:38,813
That's my William.

1096
01:00:38,815 --> 01:00:41,349
Forty-four years
I had him with me

1097
01:00:41,351 --> 01:00:44,452
and I wish you as many
with someone one day.

1098
01:00:44,454 --> 01:00:46,320
And as happy.

1099
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:50,090
Jesus, I'm pissed.

1100
01:00:50,092 --> 01:00:51,760
Alan, no!

1101
01:00:53,161 --> 01:00:54,661
Give us a hand, will you, Steph?

1102
01:00:54,664 --> 01:00:57,664
He's thrown up again.
Margaret, I am so sorry.

1103
01:00:57,666 --> 01:01:00,434

1107
01:01:10,347 --> 01:01:12,981
Margaret Donovan

01:01:28,197 --> 01:01:30,030
Well, they want to see
what's going on up here.

1115
01:01:30,032 --> 01:01:32,166
They'd have a field day.

Why don't you
come over to dai's?

1117

Just for a minute.

1118
01:01:46,983 --> 01:01:48,682
I think if you met
one or two of them...

1119
01:01:48,684 --> 01:01:51,251
Have you seen this, cliff?
About the gays?

1120
01:01:51,253 --> 01:01:53,188
I don't believe
what they say about us, Lee.

1121
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:55,322
Why should I listen
to what they say about them?

1122
01:01:55,324 --> 01:01:57,324
Get inside, you.
And shut up.

1123
01:02:00,161 --> 01:02:02,697
You're a respected woman,
Maureen.

1124
01:02:02,699 --> 01:02:05,632
People follow you.
You could set an example.

1125
01:02:07,268 --> 01:02:10,070
You're the backbone of that committee.
You work hard.

1126
01:02:10,072 --> 01:02:13,373
You've been both mother
and father to those boys.

1127
01:02:13,376 --> 01:02:15,909
Sitting on your own
in the dark, Maureen?

1128
01:02:15,911 --> 01:02:19,179
You wanna take that rod
out of your arse for a minute.

1129
01:03:07,731 --> 01:03:09,231
Good luck.

1130
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:15,704

1131
01:03:15,706 --> 01:03:17,139
Thanks.

Hello?

1133
01:03:48,672 --> 01:03:51,673
I'm in a phone box
so I'll have to be quick.

1134
01:03:52,809 --> 01:03:54,943
I got a story
for your news desk.

1135
01:04:35,719 --> 01:04:37,219
Hello, mum.

1136
01:04:50,266 --> 01:04:51,634
Bye, bromley.

1137
01:04:53,902 --> 01:04:55,304
See you.

1138
01:05:31,108 --> 01:05:33,027
Hello, sailors.

1139
01:05:34,545 --> 01:05:35,744
Morning, ladies.

1140
01:05:38,615 --> 01:05:41,150
Come on, maries.
What are they going on about?

1141
01:05:41,152 --> 01:05:42,518
With your bum chum.

1142
01:05:43,719 --> 01:05:47,322
- What's going on?
- Wait till you see this.

1143
01:05:49,291 --> 01:05:50,559

But I'm warning you, we can do
without this kind of trouble.

out collecting for us.

It's the men, dai.

1161
01:06:34,137 --> 01:06:36,637
They've already got their wives
supporting them, and now this.

1162
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:39,641
Gays. The whole country
laughing at us.

Right.

They're calling an emergency meeting.
A vote.

1167
01:06:50,954 --> 01:06:53,956
Dai's speaking up for us, of course,
but it's done a lot of damage.

1168
01:06:53,958 --> 01:06:56,518
Yeah, but we're not going
to let a little thing like this break...

1169
01:06:57,527 --> 01:06:58,659
Down! Get down!

1170
01:06:58,661 --> 01:06:59,762

1171
01:07:13,911 --> 01:07:15,478
Bastards!

1172
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,483
I don't care about what they do,
but it's a distraction.

1173
01:07:20,485 --> 01:07:22,485
It's distracting people
from the strike.

1174
01:07:22,487 --> 01:07:24,186
And then there's the children.

1175
01:07:24,188 --> 01:07:25,989
I mean,
what example is it for kiddies

1176
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:28,190
to have gays
and lesbians roaming around?

1177
01:07:28,193 --> 01:07:29,626
It's unnatural.

1178
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:32,494
There used to be a tradition in wales
of honoring your guests.

1179
01:07:32,496 --> 01:07:33,695
Do you remember that, ladies?

1180
01:07:33,697 --> 01:07:35,731
Respect? Generosity?
Hefina...

1181
01:07:35,733 --> 01:07:37,099
There's only one
thing that's unnatural

1182
01:07:37,101 --> 01:07:38,400
about this whole
bloody business.

1183
01:07:38,402 --> 01:07:40,402
Betraying the community.

1184
01:07:40,405 --> 01:07:42,572
And when I find out who sold that story,
believe me,

1185
01:07:42,574 --> 01:07:45,742
they'll know what it feels like
to be ashamed.

1186
01:07:51,282 --> 01:07:52,414
What the hell are we doing?

1187
01:07:52,416 --> 01:07:53,782
Now, let's just get
this finished, mark.

1188
01:07:53,784 --> 01:07:55,385
No, no, I mean,
what the hell are we doing?

1189
01:07:55,387 --> 01:07:57,786
They would never have known we were here
if it wasn't for this article.

1190
01:07:57,789 --> 01:07:59,456
So?
So they would never have found us.

1191
01:07:59,458 --> 01:08:01,423
So, what are you saying, mark,
I should just send them the bill?

1192
01:08:01,425 --> 01:08:03,525
Do you know how many people
read this paper?

1193
01:08:03,527 --> 01:08:05,929
This is our chance
to do something spectacular.

1194
01:08:05,931 --> 01:08:07,297
We could never drum up this kind

1195
01:08:07,298 --> 01:08:08,630
of publicity in a million years.

1196
01:08:08,632 --> 01:08:11,400
Mark, don't you just think we ought to
hold back and regroup?

1197
01:08:11,402 --> 01:08:13,802
There isn't time to regroup.
This is a news item now.

1198
01:08:13,804 --> 01:08:15,237
Today.
We have to take advantage of that.

1199
01:08:15,239 --> 01:08:17,306
They called us perverts.
Bromley,

1200
01:08:17,309 --> 01:08:19,943
it's time for an important part
of your education.

1201
01:08:19,944 --> 01:08:22,845
Hands up in this room
if you've ever been called a name like that.

1202
01:08:24,614 --> 01:08:28,283
Now, there is a long and honorable tradition
in the gay community

1203
01:08:28,286 --> 01:08:31,654
and it has stood us in good stead
for a very long time.

1204
01:08:31,655 --> 01:08:32,889
When somebody
calls you a name...

1205
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:33,957
Am I right about this, Jonathan?

1206
01:08:33,958 --> 01:08:35,024
Dead right.

1207
01:08:35,025 --> 01:08:37,426
You take it and you own it.

1208
01:08:39,497 --> 01:08:44,667
<i>¶ That's what my heart
yearns for now</i>

1209
01:08:44,668 --> 01:08:45,768
<i>¶ love and pride</i>

1210
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:47,002
I love you.

1211
01:08:47,005 --> 01:08:48,171
You owe me.

1212
01:08:48,172 --> 01:08:52,509
<i>¶ That's what my heart
yearns for now</i>

1213
01:08:53,511 --> 01:08:55,144
It's a fundraising concert

1214
01:08:55,145 --> 01:08:56,779
and we're
looking for bands to...

1215
01:08:56,780 --> 01:09:00,483
No, no. No, no, no,
I am in no way suggesting that sting,

1216
01:09:00,484 --> 01:09:02,645
or indeed any other member
of the police, is a pervert.

1217
01:09:05,088 --> 01:09:07,023
Cool. Cheers.

1218
01:09:08,792 --> 01:09:12,328
Oh, I can probably get you some more,
next week if you want.

1219
01:09:12,962 --> 01:09:14,162
He'll call.
Okay.

1220
01:09:14,164 --> 01:09:17,934
<i>¶ Take your hairdryer
blow them all away</i>

1221
01:09:17,935 --> 01:09:21,503
<i>¶ in you I've found a story
I want to keep hearing</i>

1222
01:09:21,506 --> 01:09:24,340
<i>¶ in you I see all colors
not just black or white</i>

1223
01:09:24,341 --> 01:09:29,479
<i>¶ In you I find a reason
and hope for all dreamers</i>

1224
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:32,381
there are no gay artists
on this label. I'm sorry.

1225
01:09:32,384 --> 01:09:34,149
They don't have to be gay,
that's the point.

1226
01:09:34,152 --> 01:09:36,192
This is a coming together
of all different people...

1227
01:09:39,222 --> 01:09:40,789
Reception.

1228
01:09:43,962 --> 01:09:45,795
It arrived about 10
minutes ago, Barry.

1229
01:09:47,898 --> 01:09:49,865
Yeah, well, you could
come down and get it.

1230
01:09:51,034 --> 01:09:53,235
What the bloody hell
do you think you're doing?

1231
01:09:53,238 --> 01:09:56,405
That's the number
for gay switchboard.

1232
01:09:56,408 --> 01:10:00,176
You never know, one of them
might need it one day.

1233
01:10:00,177 --> 01:10:01,511
We'll be back
in good time for the vote.

1234
01:10:01,512 --> 01:10:02,645
Right-o.

1235
01:10:02,646 --> 01:10:05,014
Any problems,
we can be reached at the bookshop.

1236
01:10:05,015 --> 01:10:06,248
You're gonna miss this train.

1237
01:10:06,251 --> 01:10:07,417
Rowena Roberts has had a baby.

1238
01:10:07,418 --> 01:10:08,818
She needs an extra box.

1239
01:10:08,819 --> 01:10:10,118
I can't hear you.

1240
01:10:10,121 --> 01:10:11,453
Rowena Roberts has had a baby.

1241
01:10:11,456 --> 01:10:14,222
Strange.
I can't... I can't... I can't hear you.

1242
01:10:14,225 --> 01:10:15,324
She needs an extra box.

1243
01:10:28,439 --> 01:10:30,206
<i>¶ Some love and pride</i>

1244
01:10:30,207 --> 01:10:35,444
<i>¶ that's what my heart
yearns for now</i>

1245
01:10:35,447 --> 01:10:37,346
<i>¶ love and pride ¶</i>

1246
01:10:37,349 --> 01:10:40,515
and the difference is this is open to everyone.
Okay?

1247
01:10:40,518 --> 01:10:42,417
Gay, straight,
it doesn't matter.

1248
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:44,587
We want people to come together
to show their support.

1249
01:10:44,588 --> 01:10:46,788
And why should gay people like me
support the miners?

1250
01:10:46,791 --> 01:10:49,859
Because miners dig for coal,
which produces power,

1251
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:52,561
which allows gay people
like you to dance to bananarama

1252
01:10:52,564 --> 01:10:54,096
until 3:00 in the morning.

1253
01:10:54,099 --> 01:10:55,230
Next question?

1254
01:10:56,934 --> 01:10:58,335
Are you all right?

1255
01:10:59,938 --> 01:11:01,372
Yes, you. The cute one.

1256
01:11:03,207 --> 01:11:04,975
I've never met a pop star.

1257
01:11:04,976 --> 01:11:06,743
I have. Max boyce.

1258
01:11:06,746 --> 01:11:08,945
He was playing swansea grand
the year our Jane was born.

1259
01:11:08,948 --> 01:11:10,713
What's funny about that?

1260
01:11:10,716 --> 01:11:14,451
You need to push the t-shirts
and the badges as hard as you can.

1261
01:11:14,453 --> 01:11:18,021
This is a fundraiser.
Make sure people are buying stuff.

1262
01:11:20,425 --> 01:11:21,792
Is he in charge?

1263
01:11:21,793 --> 01:11:23,060
He's the official photographer.

1264
01:11:29,567 --> 01:11:32,636
We don't want it to be all churchy.
Do you know what I mean?

1265
01:11:32,637 --> 01:11:34,404
It's a christening.

1266
01:11:34,407 --> 01:11:36,073
Yeah, but the readings don't all

1267
01:11:36,074 --> 01:11:37,675
have to come from the Bible,
do they?

1268
01:11:37,676 --> 01:11:39,976
You can have all sorts of things nowadays.

1269
01:11:40,444 --> 01:11:42,078
It's more open.

1270
01:11:46,484 --> 01:11:48,819
Meeting's tomorrow afternoon.
3:00 sharp.

1271
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:50,119
We'll make it as long
as we leave early enough.

1272
01:11:50,122 --> 01:11:51,220
And the vote?

1273
01:11:51,222 --> 01:11:52,422
At the end.

1274
01:11:52,425 --> 01:11:53,856
Single question,

1275
01:11:53,859 --> 01:11:56,793
can we continue taking your support
in the light of recent events?

1276
01:11:56,796 --> 01:11:58,061
"Recent events."
Mmm.

1277
01:11:58,064 --> 01:12:00,530
You won't have anything to worry about, I'm telling you.

1278
01:12:00,533 --> 01:12:01,765
When they see
what you make out of this.

1279
01:12:01,766 --> 01:12:02,932
If we make anything out of this.

1280
01:12:02,935 --> 01:12:05,536
Are you joking, man?
You're already famous.

1281
01:12:05,537 --> 01:12:07,203
Give it here.

1282
01:12:08,372 --> 01:12:10,440
"Bronski beat are
to headline a benefit

1283
01:12:10,443 --> 01:12:12,109

1284
01:12:13,612 --> 01:12:15,878
"Pits and perverts

1285
01:12:15,881 --> 01:12:19,149
"by the London lesbians' and gay men's

1286
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:20,283
Got the name wrong.

1287
01:12:20,286 --> 01:12:22,853
"The event is open to everyone,
gay or straight,

1288
01:12:22,854 --> 01:12:25,354
"and will be
a real festive occasion

1289
01:12:25,356 --> 01:12:27,791
"through which
we can express our solidarity

01:12:27,792 --> 01:12:29,292
"with the mining communities."

1291
01:12:39,570 --> 01:12:41,930
Five pounds for a t-shirt, anyone?
Five pounds for a t-shirt.

1292
01:12:46,211 --> 01:12:47,610
Don't dawdle, love.
Get indoors.

1293
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:48,945
Support the miners!

1294
01:12:59,423 --> 01:13:01,891
<i>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1295
01:13:02,527 --> 01:13:03,793
<i>To the gays.</i>

1296
01:13:05,331 --> 01:13:06,764
<i>To the straights.</i>

1297
01:13:09,067 --> 01:13:11,568
<i>And to the as-yet-undecided.</i>

<i>¶ Can you tell me why?</i>

1308
01:14:12,463 --> 01:14:14,631
This is the first gay club
we've ever been to.

1309
01:14:14,632 --> 01:14:17,333
Yeah? As a matter of fact,
we're not gay, either.

1310
01:14:17,935 --> 01:14:19,435
Oh.

1311
01:14:19,438 --> 01:14:20,837
We're miners.

1312
01:14:28,979 --> 01:14:30,146
That's perfect.

1313
01:14:30,149 --> 01:14:31,314
Hide me. Hide me.

1314
01:14:31,317 --> 01:14:33,015
Hey. Why?

1315
01:14:35,086 --> 01:14:38,188
If you see Steph,
perhaps you'd give her this?

1316
01:14:40,257 --> 01:14:42,626
They want me to
join their breakaway group,

1317
01:14:42,627 --> 01:14:44,627
lesbians against pit closures.

1318
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:45,996
Strictly women only.

1319
01:14:45,997 --> 01:14:48,231
I don't think I could trust myself, do you?

1320
01:14:53,706 --> 01:14:55,873
Are you going to
take my picture, then?

1321
01:14:55,876 --> 01:14:59,042

1322
01:14:59,045 --> 01:15:02,447

<i>Well, it's incredible to see such a mix</i>
<i>of people here tonight.</i>

1326
01:15:18,030 --> 01:15:19,796
<i>Gay and straight.</i>

1327
01:15:21,166 --> 01:15:24,002
<i>Can you see what
we've done here?</i>

1328
01:15:24,003 --> 01:15:26,237
<i>By coming together, all of us,</i>

1329
01:15:26,238 --> 01:15:28,972

<i>Back in our...</i>

01:15:50,063 --> 01:15:53,264
<i>Back in our
miners' lodge, in wales,</i>

1333
01:15:54,033 --> 01:15:56,667
<i>we have a banner.</i>

1334
01:15:56,670 --> 01:16:00,604
<i>And it's old, it's very old.
Maybe 100 years.</i>

1335
01:16:01,707 --> 01:16:05,576
<i>And it's this,
two hands together.</i>

1336
01:16:07,378 --> 01:16:09,146
<i>Joined like this.</i>

1337
01:16:10,682 --> 01:16:13,216
<i>Well, I tell you now,</i>

1338
01:16:13,219 --> 01:16:16,787
<i>you've worn our badge,
"coal not dole,"</i>

1339
01:16:18,023 --> 01:16:21,826
<i>and when the time comes,
you have my word on this,</i>

1340
01:16:22,728 --> 01:16:24,529
<i>we will wear yours.</i>

<i>Shoulder to shoulder.</i>

<i>Hand to hand.</i>

1343
01:16:34,539 --> 01:16:36,740
Come on, then, that's right.
We're off out for the night.

1344
01:16:36,743 --> 01:16:38,609
I hope you ladies
aren't going to let me down.

1345
01:16:38,610 --> 01:16:42,079
What?
We want to see everything!
Don't we?

1346
01:16:42,082 --> 01:16:43,347
What, everything?

1347
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:44,582
Even the rubber scene.

1348
01:16:47,988 --> 01:16:50,320
<i>¶ You spin me right round, baby</i>

1349
01:16:50,323 --> 01:16:52,657

<i>¶ I want your love ¶</i>

1355
01:17:14,413 --> 01:17:16,480
Sorry, ladies.
This is a men-only venue.

1356
01:17:16,483 --> 01:17:19,082
Oh, don't be daft, love.
We've come all the way from powys.

1357
01:17:22,755 --> 01:17:24,021
Evening.

1358
01:17:24,024 --> 01:17:25,655
Hello.

1359
01:17:26,926 --> 01:17:30,028
<i>¶ Blue-eyed dressed
for every situation</i>

1360
01:17:30,962 --> 01:17:34,832

01:17:34,833 --> 01:17:36,934

<i>¶ baby I can't do without</i>

1363
01:17:39,671 --> 01:17:42,206
how'd you get into
that leotard, then?

1364
01:17:42,207 --> 01:17:44,207
Um, talcum powder.

1365
01:17:44,210 --> 01:17:45,376
What?

1366
01:17:46,211 --> 01:17:47,979
Talcum powder.

1367
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:51,548
Oh. Lily of the valley, I use.

1368
01:17:57,722 --> 01:17:58,789
Mark?

1369
01:17:59,891 --> 01:18:02,426
Oh, my God.
Mark Ashton.

1370
01:18:02,661 --> 01:18:03,927
Tim.

1371
01:18:05,697 --> 01:18:07,597
Oh, this is insane.

1372
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,501
I'm bumping into
everybody tonight.

1373
01:18:10,502 --> 01:18:12,036
How are you?

1374
01:18:15,006 --> 01:18:16,440
You still changing the world?

1375
01:18:17,576 --> 01:18:19,077
- Bit by bit.
- Tim, come on.

1376
01:18:19,978 --> 01:18:21,979
I haven't been home
in four days.

1377
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:23,814
Haven't you?

1378
01:18:23,817 --> 01:18:25,783
I'm on a farewell tour.

1379
01:18:26,685 --> 01:18:28,252
Where are you going?

1380
01:18:40,498 --> 01:18:43,067
You are a beautiful man, mark.

1381
01:18:45,570 --> 01:18:47,070
I miss you.

1382
01:18:48,274 --> 01:18:52,043
Please take care
of yourself. Okay?

1383
01:18:52,046 --> 01:18:53,345
Please.

1384
01:18:53,346 --> 01:18:54,412
Come on.

1385
01:18:54,414 --> 01:18:55,480
Please take care.

1386
01:19:04,625 --> 01:19:06,625
Come on, then, girls.
That's enough.

1387
01:19:06,627 --> 01:19:10,628
Back to ours.
Bedtime. Come on.

1388
01:19:11,463 --> 01:19:13,097
I'm sorry.
Don't worry.

1389
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:14,466
You're lighter
than your husband.

1390
01:19:14,467 --> 01:19:15,934
Mmm.

1391
01:19:15,935 --> 01:19:19,738
Do you know what I was
when I met Alan?

1392
01:19:19,739 --> 01:19:21,006
Drunk?

1393
01:19:22,074 --> 01:19:23,475
Sixteen.

1394
01:19:24,444 --> 01:19:26,545
Think that's ridiculous?

1395
01:19:28,715 --> 01:19:30,149
I was pretty then.

1396
01:19:30,150 --> 01:19:31,483
You're pretty now.

1397
01:19:33,586 --> 01:19:35,988
It all goes South, doesn't it?

1398
01:19:35,989 --> 01:19:39,625
Love. Looks.
Everything.

1399
01:19:39,627 --> 01:19:41,193
That's cheery.

1400
01:19:41,627 --> 01:19:43,060
Sod it.

1401
01:19:43,063 --> 01:19:45,898
I always thought sex was
for the men, really, anyway.

1402
01:19:45,899 --> 01:19:48,766
We just put up with it, don't we?
Keep them quiet.

1403
01:19:48,769 --> 01:19:50,234
Okay.

1404
01:19:50,237 --> 01:19:53,305
I will listen to a certain amount
of drunken bollocks, Gail,

1405
01:19:53,306 --> 01:19:55,373
but sex is not just for the men,

1406
01:19:55,376 --> 01:19:57,376
it's for the women, too.
Believe me.

1407
01:20:09,289 --> 01:20:11,323
Oh, yeah.

1408
01:20:11,324 --> 01:20:13,324
Gail, come on.

1409
01:20:23,936 --> 01:20:25,703
No carpets.

1410
01:20:25,706 --> 01:20:29,073
This is Laura Ashley.
I've seen it before.

1411
01:20:30,376 --> 01:20:32,444
Where?
Cardiff.

1412
01:20:32,445 --> 01:20:33,945
What I want to know is...

1413
01:20:35,381 --> 01:20:36,547
What's this?

1414
01:20:38,818 --> 01:20:40,551
Hefina, you put
that back immediately.

1415
01:20:40,554 --> 01:20:42,220
That's nothing.

1416
01:20:42,222 --> 01:20:43,788
Here, look what else I've found.

1417
01:20:43,791 --> 01:20:46,057
You never went under his bed.

1418
01:20:49,362 --> 01:20:52,797
When was the last time
you saw anything like that?

1419
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,565
Huh? When? When?

1420
01:21:00,539 --> 01:21:02,573
Don't those women ever sleep?

1421
01:21:08,213 --> 01:21:09,747
Jesus, God, that takes me back.

1422
01:21:59,198 --> 01:22:00,265
Mum.

1423
01:22:23,789 --> 01:22:25,489
So, what were
their names again, boys?

1424
01:22:25,492 --> 01:22:27,125
Mine was Jess.

1425
01:22:27,127 --> 01:22:28,426
And mine was Carol.

1426
01:22:30,296 --> 01:22:31,595
Six straight people asked me

1427
01:22:31,597 --> 01:22:32,831
if they could
join us last night.

1428
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:34,498
You're joking?
We should set up another group.

1429
01:22:34,501 --> 01:22:36,220
Straights supporting gays
supporting miners.

1430
01:22:45,578 --> 01:22:46,746
Right, that's it, we're off.

1431
01:22:46,747 --> 01:22:48,014
What about bromley?

1432
01:22:48,015 --> 01:22:49,582
He's too late.
You've got a meeting to get to.

1433
01:22:49,583 --> 01:22:50,983
The vote, remember?

1434
01:22:51,685 --> 01:22:53,453
Okay.

1435
01:22:53,454 --> 01:22:55,087
Surely you've got
his number, Steph?

1436
01:22:55,090 --> 01:22:57,122
Nobody's got his number.
He still lives at home.

1437
01:22:57,125 --> 01:22:59,458
I'm sorry, but mark's right.
If we're going to get there by 3:00...

1438
01:22:59,461 --> 01:23:00,893
He's blown it.
Come on, let's go.

1439
01:23:00,895 --> 01:23:02,261
Oh. What a shame.

1440
01:23:02,262 --> 01:23:03,930
He was sucking face
till the lights came up.

1441
01:23:03,931 --> 01:23:06,265
I wouldn't waste any time
feeling sorry for him.

1442
01:23:06,266 --> 01:23:08,400
Can I please have an aspirin?

1443
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:48,908
<i>What the hell's this?</i>

1444
01:23:48,909 --> 01:23:51,743
Plans change, cliff.
It's not my fault.

1445
01:23:53,146 --> 01:23:54,579
No answer.

1446
01:23:54,582 --> 01:23:55,680
They must be on their way.

1447
01:23:55,682 --> 01:23:58,484
Okay.

1448
01:23:58,485 --> 01:24:01,220
I can't speak in front
of all these people, cliff.

1449
01:24:01,221 --> 01:24:02,721
I can't.

1450
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:16,668
I know you think you know what you want,
Joe, but you're so young.

1451
01:24:18,070 --> 01:24:20,939
That's what the law's for,
to protect you.

1452
01:24:32,953 --> 01:24:35,488
I didn't know
who I was at your age.

1453
01:24:41,261 --> 01:24:43,128
It's such a terrible life, Joe.

1454
01:24:45,765 --> 01:24:47,332
It's lonely.

1455
01:24:49,069 --> 01:24:50,470
Is that what you want?

1456
01:24:51,971 --> 01:24:53,372
No family?

1457
01:24:54,274 --> 01:24:57,176
Hiding from people at work,
from everyone?

1458
01:24:58,145 --> 01:24:59,612
Keeping secrets?

1459
01:25:10,090 --> 01:25:11,157
Come here.

1460
01:25:12,225 --> 01:25:14,226
Oh.

1461
01:25:14,229 --> 01:25:17,662
<i>So now cliff will speak
on behalf of the lgsm.</i>

1462
01:25:17,664 --> 01:25:19,297
The floor's yours, cliff.

1463
01:25:27,274 --> 01:25:29,475
Um... w...

1464
01:25:29,476 --> 01:25:32,511
Well, what I want to say abo...

1465
01:25:33,514 --> 01:25:36,916
About the gays and lesbians...

1466
01:25:36,917 --> 01:25:38,684
Why don't you do
us a poem, cliff?

1467
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,688
Poem! Poem! Poem!

1468
01:25:42,689 --> 01:25:44,323
Poem! Poem! Poem!

1469
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:49,529
I want to propose that
this meeting is unlawful.

1470
01:25:49,530 --> 01:25:52,931
I want to propose that this meeting
was brought forward unlawfully

1471
01:25:52,934 --> 01:25:54,367
and that most of the people here

1472
01:25:54,368 --> 01:25:56,435
aren't even from this village.
All right.

1473
01:25:56,436 --> 01:25:59,271
All right.
Let's bring it forward to the vote.

1474
01:26:04,345 --> 01:26:05,545
There we go.

1475
01:26:06,445 --> 01:26:08,146
Two hours to spare.

1476
01:26:08,149 --> 01:26:12,150
Hefina heddon, you drive
like a bloody lunatic.

1477
01:26:12,153 --> 01:26:13,920
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1478
01:26:14,654 --> 01:26:16,021
Gwen, look after the gays.

1479
01:26:16,024 --> 01:26:17,289
Right-o.

1480
01:26:25,666 --> 01:26:26,731
3:00.

1481
01:26:26,734 --> 01:26:28,801
You can't dictate
when the committee sits.

1482
01:26:28,802 --> 01:26:30,235
You told us 3:00.

1483
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:31,671
And then we had to change it.

1484
01:26:31,672 --> 01:26:32,771
Bloody disgusting way to behave.

1485
01:26:32,774 --> 01:26:33,838
If you weren't up in London...

1486
01:26:33,841 --> 01:26:35,807
It's invalid.
This whole decision is invalid.

1487
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:36,975
We can fight it.

1488
01:26:36,978 --> 01:26:38,043
We've got one fight, dai.

1489
01:26:38,046 --> 01:26:39,211
The fucking strike.

1490
01:26:39,212 --> 01:26:41,314
Or have you
forgotten that, all of you?

1491
01:26:41,317 --> 01:26:43,417
Dancing around in London.

1492
01:26:43,418 --> 01:26:46,653
The trouble with those people
is they jump on the bandwagon.

1493
01:26:46,654 --> 01:26:48,387
- What?
- It's well known.

1494
01:26:48,390 --> 01:26:50,591
They pretend they're backing you,
but what they're really doing

1495
01:26:50,592 --> 01:26:52,893
is pushing their own agenda.

1496
01:26:52,895 --> 01:26:54,027
Gay rights.

1497
01:26:54,029 --> 01:26:55,095
What?

1498
01:26:55,096 --> 01:26:57,663
We've seen articles, hefina.

1499
01:26:57,666 --> 01:27:00,100
Christ Jesus help me.

1500
01:27:00,101 --> 01:27:03,270
You better shut her mouth
or I'm going to do it permanently.

1501
01:27:04,672 --> 01:27:06,006
No, come on, that's enough.

1502
01:27:06,007 --> 01:27:08,207
An official letter will be sent.

1503
01:27:08,210 --> 01:27:10,711
I can't...
I can't listen to this.

1504
01:27:10,712 --> 01:27:12,546
To thank them most sincerely.

1505
01:27:12,547 --> 01:27:16,783
But the vote was we won't be accepting
their support any more.

1506
01:27:16,784 --> 01:27:18,944
They're causing us embarrassment,
dai, that's the thing.

1507
01:27:19,686 --> 01:27:21,887
And we're not
strong enough, not now.

1508
01:27:21,890 --> 01:27:24,091
We're struggling
to survive as it is.

1509
01:27:24,092 --> 01:27:25,826
Oh, that reminds me.

1510
01:27:31,367 --> 01:27:34,368
Courtesy of those people
and their agenda.

1511
01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:37,837
Jesus Christ.

1512
01:27:39,073 --> 01:27:41,541
I don't suppose you opened
your mouth, did you?

1513
01:27:41,542 --> 01:27:43,176
Didn't want to rock the boat,
is that it?

1514
01:27:45,546 --> 01:27:48,381
There's bloody thousands here.

1515
01:27:54,622 --> 01:27:56,789
You think you've known
someone your whole life.

1516
01:27:56,792 --> 01:27:59,091
Turns out they're
a complete stranger.

1517
01:27:59,094 --> 01:28:01,595
I'd say the same
about you, cliff.

1518
01:28:01,596 --> 01:28:03,396
I'll tell you something.
If you think this is what

1519
01:28:03,399 --> 01:28:06,332
my brother would have wanted,
you're wrong.

1520
01:28:10,137 --> 01:28:14,073
We came to help you win and if we're
not helping, we have to go.

1521
01:28:14,076 --> 01:28:15,908
This was all you.
No.

1522
01:28:15,911 --> 01:28:17,978
It was.

1523
01:28:21,314 --> 01:28:23,417
All right.
Take my advice.

1524
01:28:25,153 --> 01:28:26,886
Don't give it all to the fight.

1525
01:28:27,988 --> 01:28:29,422
Save some for home.

1526
01:28:30,957 --> 01:28:32,759
There's more to life, you know?

1527
01:28:36,530 --> 01:28:38,297
You girls have opened my eyes.

1528
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:41,268
I'm going to extend my repertoire,
you'll see.

1529
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:42,368
The vegan Delia Smith.

1530
01:28:46,006 --> 01:28:47,239
Bye.

1531
01:28:47,242 --> 01:28:48,475
Bye.

1532
01:28:48,476 --> 01:28:49,542
Take care, now.

1533
01:29:13,467 --> 01:29:15,735
It's a bloody travesty, man.

1534
01:29:48,002 --> 01:29:49,770
- I don't accept it.
- Gethin...

1535
01:29:49,771 --> 01:29:50,936
I don't.

1536
01:29:50,939 --> 01:29:53,539
They can't stop me from collecting money.
How can they?

1537
01:29:53,542 --> 01:29:55,442
- Don't be crazy, gethin.
- Geth...

1538
01:29:57,177 --> 01:30:00,514
Somebody better tell
lesbians against pit closures.

1539
01:30:03,583 --> 01:30:04,751
What now?

1540
01:30:04,752 --> 01:30:06,118
What do you mean?

1541
01:30:06,121 --> 01:30:07,587
What are we doing?
Where are we going?
It's over, Mike.

1542
01:30:07,588 --> 01:30:10,023
Were you not paying attention?
We lost.

1543
01:30:11,024 --> 01:30:12,559
And I don't know about you
but I'm pissing off.

1544
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:13,760
Where?
Anywhere.

1545
01:30:13,761 --> 01:30:15,561
I'm out of here.
What about the rest of us?

1546
01:30:15,564 --> 01:30:17,963
Do you think it might be possible
that just for once

1547
01:30:17,966 --> 01:30:19,466
you could make your
own decision, Mike?

1548
01:30:19,467 --> 01:30:21,400
You what?
Do you think that just for once

1549
01:30:21,403 --> 01:30:23,936
you could stop following me
around like a fucking spaniel

1550
01:30:23,939 --> 01:30:25,305
and let me have
a life of my own?

1551
01:30:27,108 --> 01:30:28,341
Yeah.

1552
01:30:29,143 --> 01:30:30,743
Yeah, I think I could
manage that, yeah.

1553
01:30:30,746 --> 01:30:33,380
Good. Piss off, all of you.
Leave me alone.

1554
01:30:35,449 --> 01:30:37,284
Oh, fu...

1555
01:30:41,658 --> 01:30:43,658
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

1556
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:47,427
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

1557
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:48,962
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

1558
01:30:48,965 --> 01:30:51,932
Never mind the miners.
There's gay people dying every day.

1559
01:30:51,935 --> 01:30:54,534
That's what you should
be thinking about.

1560
01:30:55,237 --> 01:30:56,703
Not the bloody miners.

1561
01:30:57,905 --> 01:30:58,972
Asshole.

1562
01:31:03,078 --> 01:31:04,145
Excuse me?

1563
01:31:07,615 --> 01:31:08,682
Excuse me?

1564
01:31:10,351 --> 01:31:12,920
Excuse me.
I only want to talk to you.

1565
01:31:22,463 --> 01:31:24,497
<i>Now, I tell you what we'll do,</i>
<i>let's come over here.</i>

1566
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:26,434
<i>This is the key
you swapped it to.</i>

1567
01:31:26,435 --> 01:31:28,935
<i>Oh, well,
we'll leave that there...</i>

1568
01:31:28,938 --> 01:31:31,505
<i>Now, just come over here, my son,</i>
<i>and get yourself a nice...</i>

1569
01:31:31,506 --> 01:31:32,873
Is Joe there, please?

1570
01:31:33,609 --> 01:31:35,509
No, I'm afraid he's out.

1571
01:31:35,511 --> 01:31:38,145
Can you tell him that his friend gethin's
in hospital?

1572
01:31:38,146 --> 01:31:39,980
It's very important.
He's, um...

1573
01:31:39,983 --> 01:31:43,184
He's in St. Thomas' hospital.
He's been beaten up.

1574
01:31:43,185 --> 01:31:44,551
Yes, of course I'll tell him.

1575
01:31:44,554 --> 01:31:46,153
And will you tell him that Steph

1576
01:31:46,154 --> 01:31:47,822
called round to see how he was?

1577
01:31:51,359 --> 01:31:52,426
Who was that?

1578
01:31:55,329 --> 01:31:58,399
Tina. She wants
a lift in the morning.

1579
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:01,969
You're back at the jobcentre
tomorrow, don't forget.

1580
01:32:07,708 --> 01:32:09,577
I should have...

1581
01:32:09,578 --> 01:32:11,578
I should have said more.

1582
01:32:13,414 --> 01:32:16,082
I could have.
I could have spoken better.

1583
01:32:18,487 --> 01:32:21,354
If you're going to cut,
cut it straight.

1584
01:32:21,356 --> 01:32:22,590
Triangles.

1585
01:32:34,403 --> 01:32:35,802
I'm gay.

1586
01:32:43,244 --> 01:32:44,578
I know.

1587
01:32:48,050 --> 01:32:50,917
I've known for a little
while now, cliff.

1588
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:54,622
Since the gays arrived?

1589
01:32:56,291 --> 01:32:59,092
Well, I can't speak
for the rest of the village

1590
01:32:59,095 --> 01:33:02,262
but speaking for myself,
since about 1968.

1591
01:33:02,265 --> 01:33:04,597
Well...

1592
01:33:07,569 --> 01:33:08,636
Yeah.

1593
01:33:37,766 --> 01:33:39,899
What's that?

1594
01:33:39,902 --> 01:33:41,068
It's the new van.

1595
01:33:41,903 --> 01:33:43,470
About time, too.

1596
01:33:46,908 --> 01:33:48,074
What the hell's this?

1597
01:33:48,077 --> 01:33:49,143
New van.

1598
01:33:49,145 --> 01:33:51,578
Courtesy of our gay friends
down in London.

1599
01:33:51,581 --> 01:33:53,014
I'm not getting in that.

1600
01:33:53,015 --> 01:33:54,448
Then you'll have to stay here.

1601
01:33:54,449 --> 01:33:55,682
In you get, lads.
Quick now.

1602
01:34:19,975 --> 01:34:21,942
You a lesbian, are you, love?

1603
01:34:21,944 --> 01:34:25,746
That's right.
We're just off to swansea now for a massive lez-off.

1604
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:47,502
<i>Britain's longest running
national strike is over.</i>

1605
01:34:47,503 --> 01:34:50,337
<i>Amongst scenes of
bitterness and anger,</i>

1606
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:52,474
<i>num delegates voted narrowly</i>

1607
01:34:52,475 --> 01:34:54,576
<i>for an organized return
to work on Tuesday.</i>

1608
01:34:54,578 --> 01:34:57,679
<i>Tomorrow most of britain's</i>
<i>coal miners will return to work.</i>

1609
01:34:57,680 --> 01:35:00,481
<i>They say they'll march back,
heads held high.</i>

1610
01:35:00,484 --> 01:35:03,150
<i>It's almost a year to the very day</i>
<i>since they walked out</i>

1611
01:35:03,153 --> 01:35:05,052
<i>and embarked on
a course of action which...</i>

1612
01:35:05,055 --> 01:35:07,655
Joe, have you seen the news?

1613
01:35:07,658 --> 01:35:09,091
Thank God for that.

1614
01:35:11,327 --> 01:35:12,493
Joe?

1615
01:35:55,805 --> 01:35:57,139
Bloody hell!

1616
01:36:28,604 --> 01:36:32,407
Mark! Where are you going?
I'm leaving.

1617
01:36:32,408 --> 01:36:35,644
I was trying to make myself
feel better and I failed.

1618
01:36:35,645 --> 01:36:37,311
I've been virtually
under house arrest.

1619
01:36:37,846 --> 01:36:39,346
Stuck with my parents.

1620
01:36:39,349 --> 01:36:40,548
I haven't seen anyone.

1621
01:36:40,551 --> 01:36:41,682
I've tried ringing Steph
but she's always...

1622
01:36:41,685 --> 01:36:43,083
Why don't you leave?

1623
01:36:43,086 --> 01:36:44,452
I did, last night.

1624
01:36:44,453 --> 01:36:45,921
I didn't even tell
them I was going.

1625
01:36:45,922 --> 01:36:48,023
That's not leaving,
it's running.

1626
01:36:48,024 --> 01:36:49,457
What are you going to do now?

1627
01:36:49,458 --> 01:36:50,658
Stay here.

1628
01:36:50,661 --> 01:36:51,792
And do what?

1629
01:36:51,795 --> 01:36:53,161
And get a job down the pit?

1630
01:36:53,162 --> 01:36:56,131
That's all they need, a trained pastry chef
with a camera.

1631
01:36:56,132 --> 01:36:58,132
When are you going to
get some guts, huh?

1632
01:36:58,135 --> 01:36:59,667
You're a member
of lgsm, bromley.

1633
01:36:59,670 --> 01:37:01,502
So stop sneaking
out of your mammy's house

1634
01:37:01,505 --> 01:37:03,470
in the dead of night
and stand up for yourself.

1635
01:37:03,472 --> 01:37:05,006
Have some pride.

1636
01:37:05,975 --> 01:37:07,742
Because life is short, okay?

1637
01:37:09,645 --> 01:37:11,011
It's short.

1638
01:37:13,481 --> 01:37:14,548
Okay?

1639
01:37:47,382 --> 01:37:48,817
What should I tell the others?

1640
01:37:48,819 --> 01:37:51,552
Nothing. I wasn't here.

1641
01:37:56,158 --> 01:37:58,326
You're a mad bugger.

1642
01:37:58,328 --> 01:37:59,927
I'm taking you home after that.

1643
01:37:59,930 --> 01:38:01,595
In the van.
No arguments.

1644
01:38:02,597 --> 01:38:04,832
Will you give this
to Jeff, please, Joe?

1645
01:38:05,501 --> 01:38:06,835
Of course I will.

1646
01:38:07,502 --> 01:38:08,569
Come on.

1647
01:38:14,109 --> 01:38:15,976
What about gethin?
Is he okay?

1648
01:38:16,545 --> 01:38:18,246
Gethin?

1649
01:38:18,247 --> 01:38:21,082
The last I heard
he was back on the ward.

1650
01:38:44,875 --> 01:38:46,274
I don't like meltis fruits.

1651
01:38:47,911 --> 01:38:50,192
Well, then, maybe you won't
go through them quite so fast.

1652
01:38:53,115 --> 01:38:54,783
Help me out with these,
will you, bromley?

1653
01:39:00,257 --> 01:39:01,489
Stay in bed.

1654
01:39:04,795 --> 01:39:06,895
Keep an eye on Jonathan for me,
will you?

1655
01:39:06,898 --> 01:39:09,131
He needs to take
care of himself.

1656
01:39:09,132 --> 01:39:10,832
It's you we're taking care of,
you daft sod.

1657
01:39:10,835 --> 01:39:12,768
If you could just make sure
he's got some groceries in.

1658
01:39:12,770 --> 01:39:14,002
Gethin...

1659
01:39:14,005 --> 01:39:15,203
He's HIV-positive, sian.

1660
01:39:20,976 --> 01:39:24,979
He's not supposed to smoke.
And he needs to eat properly.

1661
01:39:30,619 --> 01:39:32,387
Please. For me.

1662
01:39:34,957 --> 01:39:36,591
Gethin.

1663
01:39:40,130 --> 01:39:41,329
Hello.

1664
01:39:44,435 --> 01:39:45,501
This is my mum.

1665
01:39:46,103 --> 01:39:47,203
Hello.

1666
01:39:47,204 --> 01:39:48,270
Come in.

1667
01:39:52,376 --> 01:39:54,476
Back then, when they knew
even less about this thing,

1668
01:39:54,479 --> 01:39:57,279
they gave out numbers
with each diagnosis.

1669
01:39:58,381 --> 01:40:00,582
One, two, three and so on.

1670
01:40:02,452 --> 01:40:04,886
Course, when they got
into the high thousands, it...

1671
01:40:15,966 --> 01:40:17,365
I'm number two.

1672
01:40:22,405 --> 01:40:24,439
Nobody knows
what's keeping me alive.

1673
01:40:25,641 --> 01:40:27,376
I think it's the grass.

1674
01:40:32,215 --> 01:40:34,283
What are you going to do now?

1675
01:40:35,519 --> 01:40:37,153
Make you some soup.

1676
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:40,422
Drive back to wales.

1677
01:40:40,425 --> 01:40:43,426
No, I mean with your life.

1678
01:40:43,427 --> 01:40:46,429
I'm a wife and mother, love.

1679
01:40:48,097 --> 01:40:50,099
My life goes back to normal now.

1680
01:40:51,534 --> 01:40:53,101
Well, it shouldn't.

1681
01:40:54,438 --> 01:40:57,338
You've a first-class mind.

1682
01:40:57,341 --> 01:41:00,676
You should do something.
Go to college.

1683
01:41:00,677 --> 01:41:03,511
Don't waste it, sian.

1684
01:41:03,514 --> 01:41:07,082
There are young people
dying every day now.

1685
01:41:07,083 --> 01:41:08,350
Good people.

1686
01:41:09,519 --> 01:41:11,453
Clever, promising.

1687
01:41:12,689 --> 01:41:13,823
Don't you dare waste it.

1688
01:41:20,898 --> 01:41:22,465
Oh, shit.

1689
01:41:38,215 --> 01:41:39,347
Excuse me.

1690
01:41:43,118 --> 01:41:44,720
Sorry.

1691
01:41:52,429 --> 01:41:55,396
What the hell is this?
And where have you been?

1692
01:42:02,972 --> 01:42:05,440
Hello. You must be
Joe's mum. I'm sian.

1693
01:42:05,443 --> 01:42:08,077
Will you please remove your van
from my property?

1694
01:42:09,613 --> 01:42:11,613
I hope you appreciate him.

1695
01:42:11,615 --> 01:42:13,047
'Cause there's a whole village back in wales

1696
01:42:13,050 --> 01:42:14,382
who thinks he's a hero.

1697
01:42:26,530 --> 01:42:28,297
Joe.

1698
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:29,865
Mum, he's done this on purpose.

1699
01:42:29,868 --> 01:42:31,400
It's all right, I'm leaving.

1700
01:42:32,502 --> 01:42:35,037
I hope one day
we can be friends again, mum.

1701
01:42:37,140 --> 01:42:39,042
Oi, you got something
to say to your sister?

1702
01:42:39,043 --> 01:42:43,113
I've got something to say to you, Jason.
You're a dick.

1703
01:42:43,114 --> 01:42:46,615
And Tina, that tight perm doesn't suit you.
It never has.

1704
01:42:47,885 --> 01:42:49,051
I'm sorry.

1705
01:42:54,658 --> 01:42:55,859
Joe.

1706
01:42:57,994 --> 01:42:59,194
Joe.

1707
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:38,635
You all right?

1708
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:46,710
Cheers.

1709
01:43:48,046 --> 01:43:52,881
While you've been away, I've been changing my act.
You watch.

1710
01:43:52,884 --> 01:43:57,119
Demure and accommodating,
that's me.

1711
01:43:57,122 --> 01:43:59,488
The lesbian lady di.

1712
01:44:03,027 --> 01:44:05,561
I think I'd find that
a tremendous disappointment.

1713
01:44:08,198 --> 01:44:10,199
I'm glad you came back, bromley.

1714
01:44:10,202 --> 01:44:12,135
It wasn't the same without you.

1715
01:44:14,137 --> 01:44:15,337
Thanks.

1716
01:44:21,244 --> 01:44:24,180
I'm glad I came back, too.

1717
01:44:26,283 --> 01:44:29,653
If we were normal,
this is when we'd kiss.

1718
01:45:04,456 --> 01:45:06,122
There's the rest of it.
Thanks.

1719
01:45:07,792 --> 01:45:10,159
"Screw you, Thatcher"
or "fuck you"?

1720
01:45:10,162 --> 01:45:12,529
I can see the appeal of both.

1721
01:45:12,530 --> 01:45:15,398
Jonathan, "screw" or "fuck"?

1722
01:45:15,399 --> 01:45:17,567
"Screw."
It's more visceral.

1723
01:45:18,636 --> 01:45:20,904
<i>Attention, attention!</i>

1724
01:45:22,472 --> 01:45:25,507
<i>We have reason to believe that there are</i>
<i>known homosexualists</i>

1725
01:45:25,510 --> 01:45:28,511
<i>and a confirmed lesbo
inside these premises</i>

1726
01:45:28,512 --> 01:45:31,146
<i>and that they are armed
with sewing machines</i>

1727
01:45:31,149 --> 01:45:32,448
<i>and glitter.</i>

1728
01:45:35,519 --> 01:45:36,819
<i>A-ha.</i>

1729
01:45:36,822 --> 01:45:39,622
<i>Now that you have made
yourselves known to me,</i>

1730
01:45:39,623 --> 01:45:42,859
<i>I have a question for the notorious</i>
<i>accrington sodomite</i>

1731
01:45:42,860 --> 01:45:44,226
<i>known as Mike Jackson.</i>

1732
01:45:44,229 --> 01:45:45,528
Will you please put that down?

1733
01:45:45,529 --> 01:45:47,063
We have a very good relationship
with our neighbors.

1734
01:45:47,064 --> 01:45:48,898
<i>Mike.</i>

1735
01:45:51,203 --> 01:45:52,469
<i>Mike.</i>

1736
01:46:02,313 --> 01:46:04,279
<i>I behaved like a prick before.</i>

1737
01:46:06,149 --> 01:46:08,484
<i>Do you forgive me?</i>

1738
01:46:09,819 --> 01:46:13,655
Just... just get up here
and sew something, will you?

1739
01:46:27,338 --> 01:46:28,838
There you go, bromley.

1740
01:46:31,243 --> 01:46:32,743
Happy Birthday.

1741
01:46:51,695 --> 01:46:52,762
Thank you.

1742
01:46:55,033 --> 01:46:57,667
Right. Now, get to work.

1743
01:46:59,069 --> 01:47:01,109
And just for future reference...

1744
01:47:03,041 --> 01:47:04,542
My name's Joe.

1745
01:47:04,543 --> 01:47:06,976
You tell 'em, bromley.

1746
01:47:06,979 --> 01:47:10,948
Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!

1747
01:47:10,949 --> 01:47:13,650
Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!

1748
01:47:13,653 --> 01:47:18,322
Bromley! Bromley!
Bromley! Bromley!

1749
01:47:18,323 --> 01:47:20,957
Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!
Bromley! Bromley!

1750
01:47:35,006 --> 01:47:37,507
Oi, haven't you heard
about the miners, dearie?

1751
01:47:39,411 --> 01:47:40,711
They lost.

1752
01:47:43,814 --> 01:47:45,582
Have you heard? No politics.
What?

1753
01:47:45,585 --> 01:47:47,518
Mark's over with the steward now.
No politics?

1754
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:48,985
No slogans.

1755
01:47:48,988 --> 01:47:50,228
We're a mardi gras, apparently.

1756
01:47:53,425 --> 01:47:54,490
There was a general feeling...
Amongst who?

1757
01:47:54,493 --> 01:47:56,025
Amongst the committee

1758
01:47:56,028 --> 01:47:57,661
that people have become tired of politics
and that this year,

1759
01:47:57,662 --> 01:47:59,697
the tone should be celebratory.

1760
01:47:59,698 --> 01:48:01,297
With affirmative slogans
and a positive atmosphere.

1761
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:02,600
Horse shit.
If you insist on marching

1762
01:48:02,601 --> 01:48:03,967
with your banner,
you'll have to march

1763
01:48:03,970 --> 01:48:05,301
at the back with
the fringe groups.

1764
01:48:05,304 --> 01:48:07,270
Mate, we're lgsm.
We fought alongside the miners.

1765
01:48:07,273 --> 01:48:09,273
Congratulations.
But now it's time for a party.

1766
01:48:09,274 --> 01:48:11,307
What?
Bollocks.

1767
01:48:11,310 --> 01:48:13,277
<i>Complete and utter bollocks.</i>

1768
01:48:13,279 --> 01:48:14,612
What's lgsm's position?

1769
01:48:14,613 --> 01:48:15,845
We're going to march.

1770
01:48:15,847 --> 01:48:17,514
Yes, but with banners or without?
With.

1771
01:48:17,515 --> 01:48:19,483
With. This is
a fucking demonstration.

1772
01:48:19,484 --> 01:48:21,952
That's why we've decided to lead the fringe groups
at the back.

1773
01:48:21,953 --> 01:48:23,287
Why would you be leading it?
Sorry?

1774
01:48:23,288 --> 01:48:24,854
I'm not getting rid of the banner.
Listen...

1775
01:48:24,856 --> 01:48:26,390
There's got to be
some kind of compromise.

1776
01:48:26,391 --> 01:48:27,457
Why?

1777
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:28,859
Because that's the way
you get things done.

1778
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:30,360
No, it fucking isn't.
Listen.

1779
01:48:30,363 --> 01:48:33,296
Why does everything
get so aggressive with you lot?

1780
01:48:33,298 --> 01:48:35,064
Listen to me! Listen to me.

1781
01:48:35,067 --> 01:48:37,167
Whether we march
with banners or without,

1782
01:48:37,168 --> 01:48:39,904
the important thing is that we march together,
all of us.

1783
01:48:39,905 --> 01:48:42,338
That's what this whole thing
has been about since the beginning

1784
01:48:42,341 --> 01:48:44,707
and that is absolutely
how it is going to end.

1785
01:48:44,710 --> 01:48:47,011
Together, us united.

1786
01:48:47,012 --> 01:48:48,145
Bloody hell.

1787
01:48:58,890 --> 01:49:00,457
Ah, yeah!

1788
01:49:00,458 --> 01:49:01,926
I can't believe you're here.

1789
01:49:01,927 --> 01:49:03,359
I can't believe you're here.

1790
01:49:03,362 --> 01:49:04,728
All right?

1791
01:49:04,729 --> 01:49:08,399
Where are my lesbians?
Where are my lesbians?

1792
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:09,934
Hi.
Hey.

1793
01:49:11,869 --> 01:49:13,904
Hi!

1794
01:49:13,905 --> 01:49:18,341
These are all cucumber.
No butter. Stork sb every one.

1795
01:49:18,344 --> 01:49:20,010
I can't believe you came.
Miners, see?

1796
01:49:20,011 --> 01:49:21,377
We love a bloody good march.

1797
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:22,712
Right, where do you want us?

1798
01:49:22,715 --> 01:49:24,213
You lot.
I'll tell them.

1799
01:49:24,216 --> 01:49:25,282
There's too many of you.

1800
01:49:25,283 --> 01:49:26,649
What?

1801
01:49:26,652 --> 01:49:28,752
You'll have to go to the front.
You'll have to lead.

1802
01:49:28,753 --> 01:49:30,753
We're not losing our banners, mate.
What do you mean...

1803
01:49:30,756 --> 01:49:31,822
What's he mean, too many?

1804
01:49:31,823 --> 01:49:32,890
What's he on about?

1805
01:49:33,925 --> 01:49:35,426
I think he means them.

1806
01:49:50,809 --> 01:49:53,577

01:49:53,578 --> 01:49:57,547

South wales num headquarters.

1816
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:25,109
The gays and lesbians
have been absolutely magnificent,

1817
01:50:25,112 --> 01:50:26,511
there's no other word for it.

1818
01:50:26,512 --> 01:50:27,845
You must have
found it a bit weird.

1819
01:50:27,847 --> 01:50:30,849
A load of gays and lesbians
descending on you like that?

1820
01:50:30,850 --> 01:50:33,551
Why on earth would we have
found that weird?

1821
01:50:42,127 --> 01:50:43,494
<i>This way, guys.
We're at the front.</i>

1822
01:50:44,797 --> 01:50:47,798
<i>Come on, guys.
We're at the front. This way.</i>

1823
01:51:01,046 --> 01:51:03,680
Not worried about being too
visible this time?

1824
01:51:03,682 --> 01:51:04,849
Shut up and march.

1825
01:51:37,983 --> 01:51:40,918
<i>¶ There is power in a factory</i>

1826
