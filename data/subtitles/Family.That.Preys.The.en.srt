1
00:02:02,302 --> 00:02:05,601
-We want purple on the top up there.
-Yes, ma'am.

2
00:02:07,507 --> 00:02:10,442
Oh, no, dear. That whole arrangement
needs to go back there.

3
00:02:10,644 --> 00:02:13,010
-Between the windows.
-Yes, ma'am.

4
00:02:16,883 --> 00:02:19,317
Alice, you put that down.

5
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:22,955
Oh, Charlotte,
everything's so beautiful.

6
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:27,058
This is your daughter's wedding day.
l want you to enjoy yourself.

7
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,887
-l will.
-How's it going in there?

8
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:30,084
She getting dressed.

9
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:32,231
Then you need to go on in
and check on her.

10
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:34,400
l want to make sure
everything is all right.

11
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:35,693
Everything is all right.

12
00:02:35,902 --> 00:02:37,460
-You need to go on. Come on.
-Okay.

13
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:39,605
Everything's gonna be fine.
You just relax.

14
00:02:39,806 --> 00:02:41,433
Oh, yeah. l'm real relaxed today.

15
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:44,906
-There's my son and his dreadful wife.
-You be nice.

16
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:47,069
William.

17
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,874
Hello, mother. Miss Alice.

18
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:53,610
Hey, William.
Jillian, you are wearing that hat.

19
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:56,947
Mrs. Cartwright.

20
00:02:57,757 --> 00:03:00,590
Alice, that is a lovely dress.
Turn around.

21
00:03:00,794 --> 00:03:03,888
Now, don't you stop her. She's
on her way in to see her daughter.

22
00:03:04,097 --> 00:03:05,223
l am.

23
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,824
-You look pretty.
-Thank you.

24
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:12,469
Well, this is all
very oddly nice of you, Mother.

25
00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:17,132
Yes, well, if my son hadn't eloped...
then maybe l would have been able...

26
00:03:17,344 --> 00:03:21,007
...to give him the proper wedding
that mothers dream of.

27
00:03:23,617 --> 00:03:25,278
The yard sure looks lovely.

28
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,051
Come talk to an old woman, William.

29
00:03:29,256 --> 00:03:31,554
Excuse me, sweetie.

30
00:03:31,825 --> 00:03:35,886
-Now, how's Judge Sales getting on?
-He's good. He says to say hello.

31
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,397
Excuse me, waiter,
could l please get a drink?

32
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:42,092
Do l look okay?

33
00:03:42,302 --> 00:03:45,931
Andrea, you look beautiful.
Would you stop it?

34
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:47,538
l don't like this dress.

35
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:50,403
This is the dress
Mama married Daddy in.

36
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,841
So? Doesn't mean l gotta like it.

37
00:03:55,482 --> 00:03:59,350
She should have gotten
that old woman to buy me one.

38
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,653
She paid for the wedding, Andrea.
What more do you want?

39
00:04:03,857 --> 00:04:07,054
She paid for a beautiful wedding
for her black friend's daughter...

40
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,228
...so she could tell
her friends she helped...

41
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:11,158
...the poor colored woman
and her childrens.

42
00:04:11,364 --> 00:04:15,357
Stop it. Now, don't you
embarrass Mama today.

43
00:04:17,537 --> 00:04:23,601
Well, if she wants to be Mammy
and play Stepin Fetchit...

44
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,300
...it's not my problem.

45
00:04:25,512 --> 00:04:29,278
You are a piece of work.

46
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,315
-Hi, girls.
-Mama.

47
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,885
-You're excited?
-Yes.

48
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:37,613
Andrea was saying
how nice this is of Mrs. Cartwright...

49
00:04:37,824 --> 00:04:39,758
...and how much she loves this dress.

50
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,224
Oh, good, good.

51
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:45,159
Look at you, you look beautiful.

52
00:04:45,365 --> 00:04:48,391
My baby. Thank you, Jesus.

53
00:04:49,436 --> 00:04:51,996
Okay, pretty girls, let's go get married.

54
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:54,035
l'm gonna check on the cake topper.

55
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,004
Make sure little Mavis
got her rose petals, sweetie.

56
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,939
Yes, ma'am.

57
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,345
You're marrying your king today,
okay? Remember that.

58
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:11,582
-Don't embarrass Mama.
-My king.

59
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:19,726
-Come on, you gotta get straight here.
-Man, l'm nervous.

60
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:22,358
You sure you wanna do this?

61
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:24,833
Come on, l love that girl.

62
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:27,336
Then, that's all that matters, right?

63
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:31,103
-Right.
-Right.

64
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:33,778
That's straight.

65
00:05:35,915 --> 00:05:39,373
-Brother, be honest with me.
-What is it?

66
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:42,680
l know Andrea's
your wife's sister and all, but....

67
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:48,054
Am l doing the right thing?

68
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,898
-What?
-l said the same thing, man.

69
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:55,727
You just got cold feet.
You're just getting nervous, okay?

70
00:05:55,935 --> 00:05:58,495
-lt's all good.
-Okay. All right.

71
00:05:58,705 --> 00:06:02,072
l got a question for you. Do you think
you're doing the right thing?

72
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,704
-l should marry her.
-Hey.

73
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,575
Good. Then let me get you married.
Let me go see what's going on, okay?

74
00:06:10,784 --> 00:06:13,981
-Buy you a drink, so you can relax.
-Yes. A drink, a drink.

75
00:06:14,187 --> 00:06:17,816
Yes. Thought you had enough
at the bachelor party last night.

76
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:19,956
Yeah, it's still sitting with me.

77
00:06:23,863 --> 00:06:25,592
-Baby, you gotta see this place.
-Yeah.

78
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:29,291
-Hey, what's the matter?
-Andrea. She's driving me crazy.

79
00:06:29,502 --> 00:06:32,938
She is just the most ungrateful person
l know.

80
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:35,004
lf she disrespects my Mama
one more time--

81
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,108
-Calm down.
-...there wont be a wedding.

82
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,572
-l want you to relax.
-Okay.

83
00:06:38,778 --> 00:06:40,211
l'll run interference with you.

84
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:42,813
-l ain't taking this home with us.
-Okay, you better.

85
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:44,449
-l will--
-You don't want me to--

86
00:06:44,651 --> 00:06:47,211
-You'll tear these white folks' house up.
-l sure will.

87
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,115
-You gotta see this house.
-All right.

88
00:06:49,322 --> 00:06:51,790
-Kitchen, bathroom.
-l need a drink.

89
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:54,551
-No, you can't.
-Take me to the bar.

90
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:02,662
Wow, Andrea,
you sure have grown up.

91
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,338
Thank you. William, right?

92
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,269
My mother was telling me
that you got a degree in Finance.

93
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:12,775
Well, l will in about five months.

94
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:15,573
-Congratulations. That's fantastic.
-Thank you.

95
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:18,148
l want you to meet my husband.
Chris!

96
00:07:18,985 --> 00:07:19,974
All right.

97
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:27,016
Thank you for coming.

98
00:07:27,694 --> 00:07:29,389
Pleasure.

99
00:07:29,963 --> 00:07:32,557
-Hey.
-Hey, this is William.

100
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:34,791
-This is Chris, my husband.
-Congratulations.

101
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:37,060
Mr. Cartwright, thank you so much.
Thank you.

102
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,170
You know, l work in construction too.

103
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:42,034
l've been trying to get on
that building you have downtown.

104
00:07:42,242 --> 00:07:43,903
What kind of experience do you have?

105
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,840
When l was in the military,
l worked a lot of construction.

106
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:50,504
That's impressive. Well, who have you
been talking to at the company?

107
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:51,684
Some goofball.

108
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:53,580
Yeah, he's been getting
the runaround.

109
00:07:53,787 --> 00:07:56,449
Well, l'll tell you what...

110
00:07:56,656 --> 00:08:00,490
...why don't you just call me directly,
and l'll take care of it for you?

111
00:08:00,693 --> 00:08:03,719
-Are you serious?
-Absolutely. We're all family now.

112
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,899
-Okay. All right, l'm calling.
-Okay.

113
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,931
So, what are your plans
after graduation?

114
00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:11,501
Looking for a job, l guess.

115
00:08:11,805 --> 00:08:15,502
l'll tell you what, when you're ready to
join the work force, you give me a call.

116
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,733
l'm sure we can find a position for you.

117
00:08:17,944 --> 00:08:19,571
-l'll do that.
-Okay.

118
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:21,906
-Okay.
-Congratulations again.

119
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:24,106
-Thank you so much.
-Enjoy your evening.

120
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:26,581
-Oh, my God.
-Did you see that?

121
00:08:26,786 --> 00:08:28,720
-l can't believe it.
-lt's our lucky day.

122
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,667
-Hey.
-Hey.

123
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:52,367
There's big mama's little lawyer.
How you doing?

124
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:54,706
-Fine.
-Yeah, that's cool.

125
00:08:54,914 --> 00:08:57,178
Get you a biscuit. Go on.

126
00:08:57,717 --> 00:08:59,810
Now, put that down.
This is sweet tea, Junior.

127
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:03,750
-l won't have you going to the doctor.
-Thank you, Alice.

128
00:09:03,957 --> 00:09:05,584
Come on in, Mr. Blanchett.

129
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:15,660
-Hey, Alice.
-How are you doing, Nick?

130
00:09:16,903 --> 00:09:19,371
-l'm okay.
-Yeah?

131
00:09:19,606 --> 00:09:22,370
You go on in the back
and get yourself cleaned up.

132
00:09:23,443 --> 00:09:26,435
Pam? Pam.

133
00:09:26,646 --> 00:09:28,580
-Come and get Nick fixed up.
-But this--

134
00:09:28,781 --> 00:09:30,681
Come and get him fixed up.

135
00:09:30,884 --> 00:09:32,875
Come on, Nick.

136
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,430
Thank you.

137
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:00,445
You mother's a saint.

138
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:03,940
Yeah, she is.

139
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:08,145
We got some clean clothes for you,
Nick.

140
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:12,715
So do you mind
if l throw those in the trash?

141
00:10:12,926 --> 00:10:16,384
-Okay.
-And do you need a razor? You know?

142
00:10:16,596 --> 00:10:18,587
No, l'm okay.

143
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:21,665
lt's up to you. So everything's
in the bathroom, you know.

144
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:25,531
Go back there, wash up really good,
and your food will be waiting for you.

145
00:10:25,738 --> 00:10:28,502
-Okay, thank you.
-Okay.

146
00:10:31,778 --> 00:10:34,679
-Thirty-eight times, man, 38 times.
-Yeah.

147
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:37,850
-We still playing poker tonight?
-Yeah, l don't know about that.

148
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:40,281
Pam wants me
to spend some time with her tonight.

149
00:10:40,486 --> 00:10:42,954
Yeah, l hear you, it's all good.

150
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:45,954
-Thanks for the lift, bro.
-Hey, ain't no problem.

151
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,719
l keep telling Andrea,
man, l need to get a new truck.

152
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:51,829
-She keeps freaking out on me.
-You know she's gonna freak out.

153
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,157
She making all the money.

154
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:55,095
-Please.
-What?

155
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:58,896
That's gonna change, man.
As soon as we get this thing together.

156
00:10:59,672 --> 00:11:01,230
Come on, Chris. Don't start.

157
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:04,205
What? Come on, man. We can do this.

158
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,674
We know way more
than that idiot foreman of ours.

159
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,848
But we don't know nobody that's
gonna give us a shot, number one.

160
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:13,177
Number two, nobody gonna give
us no money to start up no company.

161
00:11:13,386 --> 00:11:16,287
You need to have
a little bit more faith, brother.

162
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:19,549
Listen, we get
our business plan together.

163
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,058
Old man Jackson already said his
brother-in-law works down at the bank.

164
00:11:23,262 --> 00:11:25,492
All we gotta do
is go down there and talk to him.

165
00:11:25,698 --> 00:11:27,893
-l don't know, l don't know.
-Well, l do.

166
00:11:28,101 --> 00:11:30,365
lf you're so sure, man,
what you need me for?

167
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,164
The two of us are the dynamic duo.

168
00:11:33,373 --> 00:11:36,365
-Come on, man. Are you kidding me?
-You wacko.

169
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:38,703
Do l have to listen to this
all the way home?

170
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:42,972
-Yes, you do.
-Then you taking the bus tomorrow.

171
00:11:43,182 --> 00:11:47,516
You're gonna do a purchase, and
open, and it's gonna go up like this.

172
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,881
That's where you're gonna end up.
You got that?

173
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:51,716
So this is a good one, huh?

174
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:54,757
Well, you know,
this is really, really good.

175
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:56,960
Won't you stay for supper?

176
00:11:58,297 --> 00:12:01,164
-l need to go.
-l'll fry some green tomatoes.

177
00:12:01,701 --> 00:12:05,398
l need to go. lt's too close.
l need to go. lt's too much.

178
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:08,540
Nick, if you ever feel
like you wanna come off the streets...

179
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:12,472
-...you let me know. All right?
-l'm okay. Thank you, though.

180
00:12:12,678 --> 00:12:15,203
-Just don't forget to do this, all right?
-Okay.

181
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:16,939
-That's important.
-l'll remember.

182
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,675
-Don't forget.
-l won't.

183
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:25,620
-That's a big one.
-Got it. You take care.

184
00:12:29,495 --> 00:12:30,553
Put that away for me.

185
00:12:30,763 --> 00:12:32,731
Mama, why do you entertain
that man?

186
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:35,025
He's obviously crazy.

187
00:12:35,234 --> 00:12:37,225
Be careful how you talk to strangers...

188
00:12:37,437 --> 00:12:40,338
...because you could be entertaining
an angel, unaware.

189
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,098
That's the Bible, darling.

190
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:44,333
Mama, you've been
knowing this man for years.

191
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:46,171
He ain't no angel. And if he was...

192
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:49,712
...you'd think God would send him
with money so he can pay his bill.

193
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:53,113
You know, it don't hurt
to be good to people, Pam.

194
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:57,551
-Everybody got a story.
-Oh, yeah? Well, what's his?

195
00:12:57,924 --> 00:13:01,951
He used to come in here all the time.
He loved my coffee.

196
00:13:02,161 --> 00:13:03,719
He'd leave me big tips.

197
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:10,631
Then he got fired. His wife died.
He lost custody of his kids.

198
00:13:11,104 --> 00:13:15,734
He just checked out on life.
Now he's living wherever.

199
00:13:37,997 --> 00:13:39,862
-How are you?
-Fine.

200
00:13:41,701 --> 00:13:44,602
-Hey, Priss. How was your day?
-Hey, Mama.

201
00:13:44,804 --> 00:13:47,364
-Hi, Christopher.
-Hi, Mom.

202
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:50,838
You making a drawing?
Give me a kiss.

203
00:13:51,043 --> 00:13:53,034
-We gotta go.
-Damn.

204
00:13:58,317 --> 00:14:00,717
-Where are you going?
-Home.

205
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,514
You forgot
you're supposed to pay me today?

206
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:08,522
l swear,
you act like $300 would break you.

207
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:11,390
Here. Will that cover it?

208
00:14:11,597 --> 00:14:13,588
You know what?
Keep your damn money.

209
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,391
Hey, stop it now.

210
00:14:15,668 --> 00:14:17,761
-She makes me sick.
-Stop it now.

211
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:21,235
All l'm saying is, you only keep
this child for two hours after school.

212
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,000
He's your nephew.
You ought to do it for free.

213
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,701
That's right, he's my nephew.
Not my child.

214
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:28,642
-Sit down.
-That's your responsibility.

215
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:31,043
-Mama.
-Come here.

216
00:14:34,587 --> 00:14:39,217
What is wrong with you all?
l'm the one who's sick of it.

217
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:42,952
You all been at each other's throats
all your life. What is it?

218
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:46,654
l am just so tired of her
looking down her nose at us.

219
00:14:46,866 --> 00:14:50,495
Like we didn't live in the same house,
or in the same neighborhood.

220
00:14:50,703 --> 00:14:52,864
l didn't like it then,
and l don't like it now.

221
00:14:53,072 --> 00:14:55,563
''l don't like it now.''
You hear that? She's so snooty.

222
00:14:55,775 --> 00:14:59,973
Turn around. This is your sister. When
are ya'll gonna start acting like it?

223
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:02,238
l watched you break your back
in this place...

224
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:05,645
...to put this girl through college,
and look at how she repays you.

225
00:15:05,851 --> 00:15:07,284
My back is not broken.

226
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:10,353
-She's an ingrate.
-Oh, that's a big word, Pam.

227
00:15:10,556 --> 00:15:11,818
-Shut up.
-That's enough.

228
00:15:12,024 --> 00:15:15,687
You know what, sweetie, you can keep
your little $300, okay. l don't need it.

229
00:15:15,895 --> 00:15:18,090
-But you mother does.
-l do?

230
00:15:18,297 --> 00:15:21,733
Mama, yes.
We only made $2 1 7 this week.

231
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:25,995
You do the math, Miss Finance Major.
Go on, put your fancy degree to work.

232
00:15:26,205 --> 00:15:27,763
Some weeks are better than others.

233
00:15:27,974 --> 00:15:31,137
That's why you plan for the long haul.
But l am fine.

234
00:15:31,344 --> 00:15:32,834
No, you're not, Mama.

235
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:35,980
-Keep your little money, girl.
-No.

236
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:41,284
Here. There's a check for $5000.
Does that make you feel better, Pam?

237
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:43,614
Oh, that's a start, Andrea.

238
00:15:43,823 --> 00:15:45,188
-l don't need it.
-Yes, you do.

239
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:47,154
Can l go now?

240
00:15:52,465 --> 00:15:54,296
Yeah, you can go.

241
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,865
Thank you.

242
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:02,134
-See you later.
-Come on, baby.

243
00:16:02,341 --> 00:16:04,172
Can you jump down?

244
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:12,708
Mama, you do need it.

245
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,981
You know, l'm the mama.

246
00:16:25,998 --> 00:16:30,435
-Long day?
-Yeah, yeah.

247
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:35,401
-Thank you, sweetie.
-You are so welcome.

248
00:16:40,246 --> 00:16:44,239
-You look good right now.
-Thank you.

249
00:16:44,517 --> 00:16:46,985
Well, it looks like our son...

250
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:52,214
...is going to be attending
the Whitmore Academy.

251
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:54,048
Really.

252
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:57,326
You'd think it was for a college
rather than a preschool.

253
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,055
l'm sure your mother called them.

254
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,860
Well, maybe you should call
and thank my mother.

255
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:05,793
Yes. l'll call and thank her.

256
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:09,031
So she can tell me what an awful
mother and daughter-in-law l am...

257
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:11,539
...and how l couldn't
make that happen for myself.

258
00:17:11,744 --> 00:17:16,078
Sweetheart,
you know how my mother is.

259
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:32,855
What do you think about that?

260
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:36,166
Honey, it's beautiful.

261
00:17:36,535 --> 00:17:38,696
Pull your hair back, will you?

262
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:43,505
l wanted you to have something
to wear...

263
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:46,576
...to the opening of
the new Cartwright Towers.

264
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:49,247
-You got the contract.
-Yeah.

265
00:17:49,715 --> 00:17:51,239
That's great.

266
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:55,250
l just signed a
half-a-billion dollar international deal.

267
00:17:55,454 --> 00:17:57,388
And l did it all alone.

268
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,081
My mother's gonna have to
turn the company over to me.

269
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:04,619
-She will, honey. She will.
-Yes.

270
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:29,478
l'll tell you what, why don't l
get cleaned up, take a shower?

271
00:18:31,157 --> 00:18:33,148
l'll meet you up upstairs in a little bit.

272
00:18:35,995 --> 00:18:37,656
Okay.

273
00:18:44,804 --> 00:18:46,931
Oh, yeah.

274
00:18:52,511 --> 00:18:54,342
-Go hug Daddy.
-Daddy.

275
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:57,175
Hey, you're running a little late tonight.

276
00:18:57,383 --> 00:18:58,714
-Hey, big man.
-Yeah.

277
00:18:58,918 --> 00:19:02,217
How you feeling, huh?
What's going on with you?

278
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:05,322
Why don't you go wash your hands
for dinner, okay?

279
00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:13,158
-You all right?
-l'm good, l'm good, l'm good.

280
00:19:16,368 --> 00:19:19,599
-Baby, whose car is that?
-Company car.

281
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:23,297
Company car. Wow, that's nice.

282
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:25,602
-Treating you real good over there.
-Yeah.

283
00:19:25,811 --> 00:19:28,678
They're paying for this house,
they gave you a Mercedes.

284
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:30,610
Yeah.

285
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:36,212
l wish they'd treat
the construction workers like that.

286
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:41,884
Baby, l need to talk
to this Mr. Cartwright.

287
00:19:44,163 --> 00:19:47,564
-Why?
-l just got some ideas, that's all.

288
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:51,336
He doesn't see construction workers.

289
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:56,368
-But l'll tell him for you.
-Okay.

290
00:20:11,123 --> 00:20:12,715
What is it?

291
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:16,288
l was just wondering-- l mean,
you work pretty close with him, right?

292
00:20:16,495 --> 00:20:19,055
Not that close. Why?

293
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:23,063
Well, l was just wondering if
l can get a meeting with him, that's all.

294
00:20:23,502 --> 00:20:25,436
-What are you talking about?
-Come on.

295
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:28,698
You know l always wanted
to start my own construction company.

296
00:20:28,908 --> 00:20:33,106
You know, l'm just thinking, maybe--
You know, he has all those contacts.

297
00:20:33,312 --> 00:20:37,009
He might be willing to give me one of
the smaller jobs that he passed on.

298
00:20:37,216 --> 00:20:39,446
Maybe even front me
with some of the start money.

299
00:20:39,985 --> 00:20:41,850
Don't be stupid.

300
00:20:42,054 --> 00:20:44,750
This man is not interested
in helping you.

301
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:48,552
He's a multi-millionaire,
with a lot of better things to do.

302
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:50,524
He's not trying to give out
any handouts.

303
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:52,162
l'm not asking for any handouts.

304
00:20:52,364 --> 00:20:53,763
-Chris.
-What?

305
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:57,129
Will you just ask the man for me?
That's all l'm asking for, baby.

306
00:20:57,336 --> 00:21:00,601
-Okay, okay.
-Thank you. Thank you.

307
00:21:06,845 --> 00:21:08,870
Let me get that for you.

308
00:21:11,617 --> 00:21:14,085
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

309
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,044
Chris.

310
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:21,251
l had a-- l had a long day.

311
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,987
l just need a bath.

312
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:32,296
-Lock up the back.
-All right, now.

313
00:21:34,873 --> 00:21:36,238
Can you stand it?

314
00:21:39,378 --> 00:21:41,278
l bought it because it's as old as l am.

315
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,678
Was made in the same year
l was born. Not.

316
00:21:47,152 --> 00:21:49,712
-l got it today.
-Why?

317
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:51,753
Well, it goes with my outfit.

318
00:21:54,093 --> 00:21:57,790
No, now listen. l got this idea.
l want us to drive across country.

319
00:21:57,997 --> 00:21:59,362
Like Oprah and Gayle.

320
00:21:59,565 --> 00:22:02,932
Oprah and Gayle don't have a diner
to run. l got business to do, honey.

321
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:04,432
Well, so do l.

322
00:22:04,637 --> 00:22:08,232
No, you got too much time
on your hands entirely, obviously.

323
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,340
-Alice--
-What's that smell? Burning?

324
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:14,239
Alice Evans, you have spent your life
inside the four walls of this diner...

325
00:22:14,446 --> 00:22:18,405
...and every time l ask you to go
on a trip, you give me some excuse.

326
00:22:18,617 --> 00:22:21,347
l'm having none of it.
There's a whole world out there.

327
00:22:21,553 --> 00:22:23,418
And a bunch of fools
running around in it.

328
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:25,522
lt don't need me
adding to the confusion.

329
00:22:25,724 --> 00:22:31,128
You never even seen the monuments,
or the Grand Canyon, or the ocean.

330
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:35,733
Come on. Life is short, girl.
Yours is passing you by.

331
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:38,500
-What's gotten into you?
-Nothing.

332
00:22:38,704 --> 00:22:40,604
Come on, let me take you for a spin.

333
00:22:40,806 --> 00:22:43,434
-l got to go to choir practice.
-Well, that's perfect.

334
00:22:43,642 --> 00:22:45,610
Come on. Hop in.

335
00:22:46,645 --> 00:22:50,445
l been up since 5:00 this morning.
l ain't ''hopping'' nowhere.

336
00:22:52,284 --> 00:22:55,742
l've never seen you drive.
Where is Morgan Freeman?

337
00:22:55,954 --> 00:22:59,685
-l drove here, didn't l?
-Help me, Lord.

338
00:23:04,863 --> 00:23:07,730
You've got to take off the
emergency brake. That's the smell.

339
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:10,333
-You burning out the transmission.
-Oh, no.

340
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:16,739
There we go. Okay. Hallelujah.
Hang on.

341
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:29,685
-Hey, baby.
-Hey, baby.

342
00:23:30,355 --> 00:23:32,016
Taste this.

343
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,456
-That's good.
-Good?

344
00:23:35,661 --> 00:23:37,219
That's better.

345
00:23:37,763 --> 00:23:40,926
-How was work?
-Work was work.

346
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:42,900
Chris. All day long...

347
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:45,798
...talking about us starting
our own construction company.

348
00:23:46,004 --> 00:23:48,097
Well, have you given it any thought?

349
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,838
Baby, you kidding me? Come on.

350
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:53,204
l mean, it doesn't sound
like a bad idea.

351
00:23:53,412 --> 00:23:56,074
Speaking of bad ideas,
you know what he wants us to do?

352
00:23:56,281 --> 00:24:01,082
He wants us to go to Cartwright and
ask him for the money for the start-up.

353
00:24:02,654 --> 00:24:05,987
-And?
-What you mean, ''And''?

354
00:24:06,191 --> 00:24:08,421
''Excuse, Mr. Cartwright,
l know we work for you...

355
00:24:08,627 --> 00:24:11,653
...but can you give us $300,000
so we can become your competition?''

356
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:14,355
''l love black people.
Here's the money.'' Come on, baby.

357
00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:17,729
That's so silly. Come on. lf you
come up with a good business plan...

358
00:24:17,936 --> 00:24:20,166
...maybe, you know,
we could get our own loan.

359
00:24:20,372 --> 00:24:22,431
Now you sound like Chris.

360
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:25,166
Every minute we get,
he's talking about what's wrong...

361
00:24:25,377 --> 00:24:28,244
...and what we can do better,
and how we can do it better.

362
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:30,506
Maybe he has a point.

363
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,382
l get it. You've been talking to Chris
about this.

364
00:24:34,586 --> 00:24:36,247
No.

365
00:24:36,455 --> 00:24:40,653
l know we ain't balling out of control
like your sister, but we're all right.

366
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:44,090
-l think we got a comfortable life.
-lt has nothing to do with that.

367
00:24:44,296 --> 00:24:48,926
-l could care less about her.
-Then, what is it?

368
00:24:50,936 --> 00:24:53,905
No, no, no, you started this.
Tell me, what is it?

369
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:59,133
Ben, you used to have big dreams.

370
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:03,880
And somewhere along the line, baby,
you stopped dreaming.

371
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:08,681
Do you remember how much debt we
were in when l got out of the military?

372
00:25:08,887 --> 00:25:10,411
-l know.
-Remember how we were struggling?

373
00:25:10,622 --> 00:25:12,055
We're just getting on our feet.

374
00:25:12,257 --> 00:25:16,318
Can we be stable for a little while
before we go dream-chasing?

375
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:18,888
-Okay.
-Thank you.

376
00:25:19,097 --> 00:25:20,826
Sorry.

377
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:27,468
Oh, you mad now.

378
00:25:27,673 --> 00:25:29,732
l'm sorry, baby, l'm just tired.

379
00:25:29,942 --> 00:25:32,706
We shouldn't be arguing over money.
Come on. Come on.

380
00:25:32,911 --> 00:25:36,210
-That's true.
-lt's all good, baby.

381
00:25:36,882 --> 00:25:40,511
-So when's dinner ready?
-The bathtub is ready.

382
00:25:41,653 --> 00:25:44,121
-Yeah.
-Shot down.

383
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,918
-Just until you clean it up a little bit.
-You don't like the funk?

384
00:25:48,126 --> 00:25:50,390
Not unless it's P-Funk.

385
00:25:51,163 --> 00:25:54,291
-Well, other women like the funk.
-You know what?

386
00:27:44,209 --> 00:27:47,576
l've never heard anything so beautiful
in all my days.

387
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:50,247
That girl been singing like that
since she was 6.

388
00:27:52,818 --> 00:27:57,619
Alice, do you think God forgives us
for all our previous sins?

389
00:28:00,258 --> 00:28:04,957
Sweetie, that's why Jesus died,
to pay for our sins so we don't have to.

390
00:28:05,163 --> 00:28:10,362
Sometimes l feel as though l've been
paying for things my entire life.

391
00:28:10,936 --> 00:28:12,426
lf you having a midlife crisis...

392
00:28:12,637 --> 00:28:15,902
...l better get that choir back in here
to sing some more.

393
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:24,408
Just, thank you,
for being my true friend.

394
00:28:25,684 --> 00:28:29,450
l've only been the kind of friend to you
that you've been to me.

395
00:28:29,654 --> 00:28:32,088
Have l been good to you?

396
00:28:32,657 --> 00:28:34,818
Yes, you have.

397
00:28:35,027 --> 00:28:39,123
My girls and l are very grateful for you.
You know that.

398
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:43,630
-Are you okay?
-Oh, l'm fine. l'm fine.

399
00:28:48,373 --> 00:28:52,207
Are you sure you're not gonna
drive across the country with me?

400
00:28:52,411 --> 00:28:54,879
l am so sure.

401
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,945
Well, l'm leaving
a week from Sunday...

402
00:28:57,149 --> 00:28:59,276
...whether you're in
or whether you're out.

403
00:28:59,484 --> 00:29:03,352
You're gonna miss
all my cracker barrels....

404
00:29:19,071 --> 00:29:21,767
Well, l know your work at Sunshine
was very impressive.

405
00:29:21,973 --> 00:29:24,635
They posted record quarters
during your tenure.

406
00:29:24,843 --> 00:29:26,105
lt was a good time.

407
00:29:26,311 --> 00:29:27,972
And you're sure
you ready to move on?

408
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,841
Yes, ma'am, l am.

409
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:33,211
-You've studied our operation?
-l know that if you give me time...

410
00:29:33,418 --> 00:29:37,650
...l'll be able to take your company
global and build a bigger profit share.

411
00:29:39,324 --> 00:29:42,691
-Miss Dexter, welcome to Cartwright.
-Thank you.

412
00:29:42,894 --> 00:29:46,091
This board is gonna be so glad
to see some new blood.

413
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:49,131
All except for one, that is.

414
00:29:49,334 --> 00:29:51,859
-And who might that be?
-My son.

415
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:55,904
William. Come on in here
and meet Miss Abigayle Dexter.

416
00:29:56,108 --> 00:29:58,576
-Hello.
-Hi.

417
00:29:58,777 --> 00:30:00,244
Hi.

418
00:30:02,314 --> 00:30:05,715
l know your work.
So, what's going on, Mother?

419
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:09,318
Well, we're just concluding
a little business.

420
00:30:10,956 --> 00:30:12,218
What kind of business?

421
00:30:12,424 --> 00:30:13,914
Well, Abby was just telling me...

422
00:30:14,126 --> 00:30:16,424
...she thinks
she can take this company global.

423
00:30:16,962 --> 00:30:21,058
Well, Mother, we already have.
l just signed the Hong Kong account.

424
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:23,734
We're building their new towers
in Los Angeles.

425
00:30:23,935 --> 00:30:25,664
-Wow, that's great.
-Thanks.

426
00:30:25,871 --> 00:30:29,238
When l was shadowing that deal,
l saw that you were having difficulty...

427
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:32,842
...negotiating the vertical and
the signage. How did you manage?

428
00:30:33,812 --> 00:30:36,280
Well, Miss Dexter, l have my ways.

429
00:30:36,481 --> 00:30:39,507
lf you'd like me to take a look
at the deal, l'd be happy to do so.

430
00:30:39,718 --> 00:30:42,653
l'm sorry, excuse me.
Why are you here again?

431
00:30:44,422 --> 00:30:47,289
l just stole this young thing
from Smith Sunshine.

432
00:30:47,492 --> 00:30:49,050
She's gonna be our new COO.

433
00:30:54,132 --> 00:30:57,499
Miss Dexter, would you be so kind
as to wait for me in the sunroom?

434
00:30:57,702 --> 00:31:02,298
-We can finish up there.
-Certainly. Excuse me.

435
00:31:08,613 --> 00:31:11,582
l thought you were considering me
for that position, Mother.

436
00:31:11,783 --> 00:31:14,718
Well, why on earth
would you think that?

437
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:19,653
Why? Because l'm your son,
that's why.

438
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,993
Grow up then.

439
00:31:23,662 --> 00:31:25,823
-You are not qualified.
-You know l'm qualified.

440
00:31:26,031 --> 00:31:28,363
l know this company
like the back of my hand.

441
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:31,001
You, you, you. You know nothing.

442
00:31:31,203 --> 00:31:35,799
But what l tried to teach you these last
three years, you haven't learned it yet.

443
00:31:39,277 --> 00:31:42,769
l will expect you
to bring Miss Dexter up to speed.

444
00:31:43,315 --> 00:31:44,577
ls that clear?

445
00:31:48,653 --> 00:31:52,020
Yes, Mother. lt's very clear.

446
00:31:56,595 --> 00:31:58,358
Agnes.

447
00:31:59,197 --> 00:32:02,394
Bring me a bourbon in the sunroom
and see what Miss Dexter would like.

448
00:32:02,601 --> 00:32:04,762
Right away, Mrs. Cartwright.

449
00:32:11,076 --> 00:32:12,566
Okay.

450
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:16,103
Okay, Mother.

451
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:22,312
We've been in construction
all of our lives.

452
00:32:22,854 --> 00:32:25,345
Most of our lives, anyway.

453
00:32:25,857 --> 00:32:28,382
You know, that's all we need
is a little startup money.

454
00:32:28,593 --> 00:32:30,754
-l'm sorry.
-Told you this was a waste of time.

455
00:32:30,962 --> 00:32:33,021
What do you mean, sorry?

456
00:32:33,632 --> 00:32:35,463
You haven't even
looked at the proposal.

457
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:38,636
We're not in the position at this time
to take this kind of risk.

458
00:32:38,837 --> 00:32:42,204
-Not in the position?
-What you're asking me is impossible.

459
00:32:42,407 --> 00:32:44,739
lt's not impossible.

460
00:32:44,943 --> 00:32:46,672
We gotta get back
before lunch is over.

461
00:32:46,878 --> 00:32:48,641
lf he would just
look at the proposal--

462
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:50,781
Let's go. Thank you.

463
00:32:51,616 --> 00:32:55,211
Hold on, let me get some money
real quick.

464
00:32:58,323 --> 00:33:00,018
-Welcome to First One.
-How you doing?

465
00:33:00,225 --> 00:33:03,126
l'm good, thank you.
What can l do for you?

466
00:33:03,328 --> 00:33:07,025
-l just need to get out about $40.
-Okay.

467
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:10,759
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

468
00:33:11,803 --> 00:33:13,395
From which account?

469
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:15,596
Well, there's only one account.

470
00:33:15,807 --> 00:33:18,708
Sorry. lt says here Andrea
and Christopher Bennett, same social.

471
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:21,743
Yeah, l know. She's my wife.
There's more than one account?

472
00:33:21,946 --> 00:33:25,438
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, so, what's that balance on it?

473
00:33:26,017 --> 00:33:30,351
Two hundred eighty-six
thousand dollars and forty-three cents.

474
00:33:31,056 --> 00:33:32,523
Come again?

475
00:33:33,224 --> 00:33:34,851
What do we got?

476
00:33:55,513 --> 00:33:58,448
Very impressive.
There's only one problem.

477
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:01,642
And l'm sure Andrea being
in accounting, she can appreciate this.

478
00:34:01,853 --> 00:34:05,584
This deal is front-loaded.
All the gain is upon completion.

479
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,087
And your point is?

480
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:12,320
My point is $25 million added
to an already stressed fiscal budget.

481
00:34:12,997 --> 00:34:15,124
This is a solid deal.

482
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:20,066
This company stands to have record
highs in the first quarter of over 1 1 --

483
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:23,729
-l understand that.
-Don't interrupt me when l speak.

484
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:28,944
l made this deal
on the strength of this company.

485
00:34:29,147 --> 00:34:31,172
And it's a good deal.

486
00:34:32,283 --> 00:34:36,151
Are you done? May l speak now?

487
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:41,421
-Yeah, you can speak.
-l understand that.

488
00:34:41,626 --> 00:34:45,528
But this company is in no financial
position to shoulder such a risk.

489
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,631
We're overextended with the
four projects we're involved in now.

490
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:53,770
And now you go and sign a deal
that makes us liable for $25 million...

491
00:34:53,972 --> 00:34:55,906
...that we don't have right now.

492
00:34:56,107 --> 00:34:59,474
-This company's cash poor.
-This is a publicly traded company.

493
00:34:59,677 --> 00:35:03,113
Surely we can raise $25 million.
We've done it before, we'll do it again.

494
00:35:03,314 --> 00:35:04,941
And how do you propose we do that?

495
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:08,677
l'll tell you. My mother sells 1 0 percent
of the business.

496
00:35:08,887 --> 00:35:12,789
She would lose her control of the vote.
l can't advise her to do that.

497
00:35:14,626 --> 00:35:18,722
Advise her?
You wouldn't advise her of anything.

498
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,488
Who do you think you are?

499
00:35:22,033 --> 00:35:25,127
l'm the woman that your mother
put in place to run this company...

500
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:27,133
...and that's what l intend to do.

501
00:35:27,338 --> 00:35:28,999
You don't come into my business...

502
00:35:29,207 --> 00:35:31,402
...speaking to me
as if l'm some subordinate.

503
00:35:33,144 --> 00:35:35,738
And what makes you think
that you're qualified...

504
00:35:35,947 --> 00:35:37,642
...to advise my mother of anything?

505
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:40,374
Perhaps it's my Yale Law degree.

506
00:35:40,585 --> 00:35:42,712
Or my masters in Finance.

507
00:35:42,921 --> 00:35:48,052
Or my 1 5 years of experience that
would qualify me, and not allow us...

508
00:35:48,259 --> 00:35:50,659
...to enter into an agreement
that is so top-heavy...

509
00:35:50,862 --> 00:35:52,830
...it would bring this company
to its knees.

510
00:35:53,031 --> 00:35:55,226
To its knees?
l'm talking about making money.

511
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:57,298
Do you understand
what you have done?

512
00:35:57,502 --> 00:35:59,026
l might put your new office--

513
00:35:59,237 --> 00:36:01,535
May l please speak?

514
00:36:02,974 --> 00:36:04,703
lf it's okay with Mr. Cartwright.

515
00:36:05,376 --> 00:36:07,173
Go ahead, Andrea.

516
00:36:07,612 --> 00:36:11,104
Mr. Cartwright
owns 3 percent of this company.

517
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:13,614
So if his mother were to sell...

518
00:36:13,818 --> 00:36:16,844
...the family would still have
the controlling vote.

519
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:21,820
l will speak to Mrs. Cartwright.

520
00:36:22,026 --> 00:36:24,551
But not until l've exhausted
all other possibilities.

521
00:36:24,762 --> 00:36:26,059
Good. You do that.

522
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:28,027
l will also make it perfectly clear...

523
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:30,428
...the position
that you've put this company in.

524
00:36:30,635 --> 00:36:33,968
Charles, Mark, Betty, come with me.

525
00:36:34,806 --> 00:36:37,707
Everybody else, you can leave.
Thank you very much.

526
00:36:49,153 --> 00:36:51,178
That was eventful.

527
00:36:52,624 --> 00:36:54,922
-Are you okay?
-l'm fine.

528
00:36:56,027 --> 00:36:58,495
-Hey, love.
-Jillian.

529
00:36:58,696 --> 00:37:00,755
What a surprise. Hey, sweetheart.

530
00:37:01,165 --> 00:37:02,462
Just thought l'd stop by...

531
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:04,897
...maybe take
my hard-working husband to lunch.

532
00:37:05,103 --> 00:37:06,536
Well, that's sweet.

533
00:37:06,738 --> 00:37:08,729
Just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

534
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,339
l'm fine, baby, l'm fine.

535
00:37:12,043 --> 00:37:14,136
-Hi, Mrs. Cartwright.
-Hi, Robin.

536
00:37:14,345 --> 00:37:15,437
Master's on line three.

537
00:37:15,647 --> 00:37:17,444
He is?
Okay, l gotta take that, sweetie.

538
00:37:17,649 --> 00:37:20,311
-Come see me in 1 0 minutes.
-Okay.

539
00:37:21,052 --> 00:37:24,180
-Andrea, my goodness.
-Hi.

540
00:37:24,389 --> 00:37:26,653
Four years. l haven't seen you
since your wedding.

541
00:37:26,858 --> 00:37:29,554
How's your husband?
Christopher, right?

542
00:37:29,761 --> 00:37:32,059
Yeah. He's good.

543
00:37:32,397 --> 00:37:34,126
Doesn't he work for the company?

544
00:37:34,332 --> 00:37:37,426
Yeah, on the construction side.

545
00:37:38,102 --> 00:37:39,831
l see.

546
00:37:45,176 --> 00:37:46,370
Andrea.

547
00:37:49,447 --> 00:37:53,816
That's a-- A lovely fragrance.

548
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,780
Thank you.

549
00:38:03,528 --> 00:38:05,018
Sixteen on center.

550
00:38:05,229 --> 00:38:07,959
He said once the inspector gets here
to take a look at it...

551
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:09,997
...he'll be able to let us go.

552
00:38:11,536 --> 00:38:13,561
You listening to me, Chris?

553
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:16,438
Chris.

554
00:38:19,243 --> 00:38:20,676
-Hey.
-Yeah?

555
00:38:20,878 --> 00:38:23,346
What's going on with you, man?
The bank said no, okay?

556
00:38:23,548 --> 00:38:27,746
lt's done. Let it go. We got a job,
it's all good. What is wrong with you?

557
00:38:28,453 --> 00:38:32,219
-Chris.
-What? What? l'm good.

558
00:38:32,423 --> 00:38:34,391
-Hit the ground.
-Come on, l just said--

559
00:38:34,592 --> 00:38:37,618
Hit the ground. We're 55 stories
in the air, l gotta depend on you.

560
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:41,697
-You zoning out? What's going on?
-Nothing, man.

561
00:38:41,899 --> 00:38:42,991
The bank.

562
00:38:43,568 --> 00:38:46,969
-The man said no.
-That's not what l'm talking about.

563
00:38:47,171 --> 00:38:50,265
-What the hell you talking about?
-Remember when l went to the bank?

564
00:38:50,475 --> 00:38:53,967
l go up to the teller to get some money
and she brought up another account.

565
00:38:54,178 --> 00:38:55,770
With Andrea's name on it.

566
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,005
And?
All women keep money on the side.

567
00:38:58,216 --> 00:39:00,741
Pam got $300 in an account.
She don't even think l know.

568
00:39:00,952 --> 00:39:03,716
l am not talking about
a little money, man.

569
00:39:04,088 --> 00:39:08,422
l am talking about $286,000, brother.

570
00:39:10,228 --> 00:39:11,286
Come again?

571
00:39:11,963 --> 00:39:15,364
-Same thing l said.
-You better call her, man.

572
00:39:15,566 --> 00:39:19,366
l'm not talking to her.
l'm not even sure that l wanna know.

573
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,471
She makes $65,000 a year.

574
00:39:22,674 --> 00:39:25,165
Where in the hell
is she getting that money from?

575
00:39:25,977 --> 00:39:31,506
Matter of fact, don't tell Pam anything,
all right?

576
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:35,078
l'm a grown-ass man.
l don't tell my wife everything.

577
00:39:35,286 --> 00:39:37,982
l knew there was a catch.

578
00:39:38,356 --> 00:39:42,520
The minute you told me
you closed that deal, l just knew it.

579
00:39:43,227 --> 00:39:44,717
Now, how do l get out of it?

580
00:39:45,363 --> 00:39:47,160
l think that would be bad for business.

581
00:39:47,365 --> 00:39:51,131
This company's been known to sue
in very public, nasty trials.

582
00:39:51,335 --> 00:39:53,997
Well, we're gonna have to find a way
to raise some capital.

583
00:39:54,205 --> 00:39:56,139
Call Rolly over at Bank of Austria.

584
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,070
With the housing market where it's at,
we're gonna have to--

585
00:39:59,277 --> 00:40:01,905
Just call him.

586
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:07,113
l did. We're at our max.
He won't loan us another dime.

587
00:40:07,618 --> 00:40:10,052
After all these years
of doing business with him?

588
00:40:10,254 --> 00:40:13,417
lt was our wealth that
established them as the force they are.

589
00:40:13,624 --> 00:40:15,421
And he said no?

590
00:40:20,431 --> 00:40:26,370
Well, you tell him if he doesn't, l will
close my account and move to Bank Z.

591
00:40:26,571 --> 00:40:28,937
Brian has been begging
for our business for years.

592
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:32,803
We have a good relationship there.
l don't think that that's the answer.

593
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,672
Well, what do you think is the answer?

594
00:40:36,147 --> 00:40:40,811
This is an awful situation,
but there is a solution, albeit imposing.

595
00:40:41,018 --> 00:40:44,545
-lf we sell 1 0 percent of the stock--
-l won't hear of it.

596
00:40:45,523 --> 00:40:49,084
That puts me in the minority.
My vote won't matter.

597
00:40:49,293 --> 00:40:50,487
No, Mother.

598
00:40:50,695 --> 00:40:52,788
l still have a percentage
in the company...

599
00:40:52,997 --> 00:40:55,022
...which would give you
controlling vote.

600
00:40:55,233 --> 00:40:56,359
Along with yours.

601
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:01,530
Mrs. Cartwright, he is your son.

602
00:41:02,373 --> 00:41:08,039
Miss Dexter, my family
has been known to prey on the weak.

603
00:41:10,081 --> 00:41:13,050
Mother, you don't trust me?

604
00:41:14,218 --> 00:41:16,709
lt's not you l don't trust, darling.

605
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:20,687
lt's your private thoughts
that give me pause.

606
00:41:25,263 --> 00:41:26,855
Will you at least consider it?

607
00:41:35,606 --> 00:41:38,074
Ten percent. Sell it.

608
00:41:40,812 --> 00:41:44,976
Now, William.
l know you're up to something.

609
00:41:45,183 --> 00:41:47,981
No. Just money.

610
00:41:48,753 --> 00:41:50,584
Well, let me tell you...

611
00:41:50,788 --> 00:41:56,658
...if you burn me,
l will nail your ass to the wall.

612
00:41:59,363 --> 00:42:01,058
Yes, ma'am.

613
00:42:05,703 --> 00:42:07,637
Your mother's tough.

614
00:42:10,007 --> 00:42:12,271
All mothers aren't like her?

615
00:42:13,611 --> 00:42:17,479
You know, Miss Dexter,
l think we got off on the wrong foot.

616
00:42:17,682 --> 00:42:20,378
Maybe l could take you
to dinner sometime.

617
00:42:22,687 --> 00:42:24,314
Sure.

618
00:42:25,223 --> 00:42:27,783
Me and my husband would love to.

619
00:42:52,049 --> 00:42:55,109
-Working late again, huh?
-Yeah.

620
00:42:55,553 --> 00:42:57,544
-Well, come here.
-l'm tired, Chris.

621
00:42:57,755 --> 00:43:00,656
No, baby, come here.
Sit down for a second.

622
00:43:01,592 --> 00:43:03,082
What?

623
00:43:09,033 --> 00:43:12,127
-What are you doing with this?
-You know, l was wondering myself.

624
00:43:12,336 --> 00:43:14,668
Like, how are we affording
all of this stuff?

625
00:43:14,872 --> 00:43:17,340
Where in the hell
did all this money come from?

626
00:43:18,209 --> 00:43:20,734
-You sure you wanna know?
-Please, this is not a game.

627
00:43:20,945 --> 00:43:22,879
Now, you tell me
what the hell is going on.

628
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,571
None of your damn business.

629
00:43:25,783 --> 00:43:28,809
You don't ask me questions
about the money l'm making.

630
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:33,354
l can be the nicest guy in the world,
but if you keep pissing me off...

631
00:43:33,557 --> 00:43:36,219
...then we are gonna have a problem
up in here.

632
00:43:37,528 --> 00:43:40,691
l get bonuses at work.

633
00:43:40,965 --> 00:43:42,523
-l get bonuses at work.
-Bonuses.

634
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:44,826
Yes, and this is my money.

635
00:43:45,036 --> 00:43:48,233
This is my money, Chris,
and l don't tell you everything...

636
00:43:48,439 --> 00:43:51,465
...because you're always talking about
some get-rich-quick scheme.

637
00:43:51,842 --> 00:43:56,142
You always find something
to invest in, or buy, or screw up.

638
00:43:56,347 --> 00:43:59,373
l'm just trying to make a better life
for our family, that's all.

639
00:44:00,017 --> 00:44:01,644
Family.

640
00:44:03,187 --> 00:44:05,747
By blowing all my money?

641
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:11,894
Chris, you will never
be William Cartwright.

642
00:44:12,096 --> 00:44:13,529
He's smart.

643
00:44:13,731 --> 00:44:18,566
He can carry on a conversation with
the business world without stuttering.

644
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:21,300
He's charming.

645
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:26,101
He went to Harvard. Get over it.

646
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:31,914
You will never be him,
or in business for yourself.

647
00:44:34,418 --> 00:44:37,683
Now, put my mail back
in the envelope...

648
00:44:37,888 --> 00:44:40,755
...and put it back in the drawer
where you found it.

649
00:44:50,468 --> 00:44:52,629
He looked at the paper,
he looked up at us:

650
00:44:52,837 --> 00:44:55,101
''We ain't gonna give you
all that money.''

651
00:44:55,306 --> 00:44:58,275
-So they said no.
-Then go to another bank.

652
00:44:58,476 --> 00:44:59,909
lt's just one bank.

653
00:45:00,111 --> 00:45:03,512
Baby, why you pushing this so hard,
huh? Tell me, l don't get it.

654
00:45:03,714 --> 00:45:06,308
You know, maybe it's a sign
we ain't supposed to do this.

655
00:45:06,517 --> 00:45:10,886
Ben, you can do this, okay?
You can, baby.

656
00:45:12,757 --> 00:45:18,320
You know what l think you're afraid of?
You're afraid that this just might work.

657
00:45:18,562 --> 00:45:22,965
-l ain't scared of nothing.
-Okay, well, then what is it?

658
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:27,797
l like our life, it's simple. We're happy.
Why can't we leave it at that?

659
00:45:28,406 --> 00:45:32,240
l want a new sofa. And l'm not asking
for diamonds and pearls.

660
00:45:32,443 --> 00:45:35,071
l'm not asking
to be filthy rich here, okay?

661
00:45:35,279 --> 00:45:39,978
l just think it's okay
to want a little bit more.

662
00:45:40,184 --> 00:45:43,642
A little more is the problem that
Charlotte has, your sister and William.

663
00:45:43,854 --> 00:45:45,947
They all want more.
Those people are not happy.

664
00:45:46,157 --> 00:45:47,715
l don't want us to end up like that.

665
00:45:47,925 --> 00:45:49,790
Your sister hiding this money
from Chris--

666
00:45:49,994 --> 00:45:51,188
What?

667
00:45:53,197 --> 00:45:54,994
What do you mean, hiding money?

668
00:45:57,568 --> 00:45:58,728
Did l say hiding money?

669
00:45:58,936 --> 00:46:01,803
Yeah, that's what you said.
Come on, Ben, don't do that.

670
00:46:02,273 --> 00:46:04,366
-Did l--?
-You said, ''hiding money.''

671
00:46:04,575 --> 00:46:06,805
-What do you mean?
-Baby, you can't say nothing.

672
00:46:07,011 --> 00:46:08,774
l won't say nothing.

673
00:46:09,713 --> 00:46:12,147
-You lying, you gonna say some--
-l'm not.

674
00:46:12,349 --> 00:46:13,907
Okay, fine. We went to the bank...

675
00:46:14,118 --> 00:46:16,018
...and Chris found out
she had another account.

676
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,984
-You know how y'all women do.
-What's in the account?

677
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:21,720
-Money.
-Money, right. How much?

678
00:46:25,329 --> 00:46:29,425
-Almost $300,000.
-What? Three hundred thou--?

679
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:30,657
Calm down.

680
00:46:30,868 --> 00:46:32,733
And she won't give Mama
any money?

681
00:46:32,937 --> 00:46:34,802
Knew l shouldn't have told you.

682
00:46:35,005 --> 00:46:37,235
Wait a minute,
where is she getting this money?

683
00:46:37,441 --> 00:46:39,534
Now you asking the questions
we wanna know.

684
00:46:39,743 --> 00:46:42,211
-l'll get to the bottom of it.
-You can't talk to her.

685
00:46:42,413 --> 00:46:44,074
You ain't supposed to know.

686
00:46:44,281 --> 00:46:47,842
Chris is not gonna do it.
l'll get to the bottom of it. Your move.

687
00:46:52,223 --> 00:46:54,054
Charlotte.

688
00:46:56,594 --> 00:46:58,994
Charlotte, it's Alice.

689
00:46:59,497 --> 00:47:03,695
Hey. Agnes let me in.

690
00:47:03,901 --> 00:47:05,664
Charlotte?

691
00:47:06,704 --> 00:47:08,501
Hey.

692
00:47:09,874 --> 00:47:11,307
-Hey.
-Good morning.

693
00:47:11,509 --> 00:47:15,172
Good morning.
What you doing sitting in the dark?

694
00:47:15,379 --> 00:47:20,681
Just such a peaceful day.
So beautiful out there.

695
00:47:20,885 --> 00:47:26,118
Yeah, it is, it's very, but you
sitting in here staring at the drapes.

696
00:47:26,323 --> 00:47:30,225
Don't know how you know.
Did you oversleep?

697
00:47:30,528 --> 00:47:32,655
What has that maid of yours
been doing?

698
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,921
l don't know.

699
00:47:34,131 --> 00:47:37,123
l don't either,
but it sure ain't been cleaning.

700
00:47:37,434 --> 00:47:40,892
-Come on.
-You come to see me off?

701
00:47:41,105 --> 00:47:44,666
No, l did not.
l got my bags in your car.

702
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:49,869
Come on. We going. Get dressed, girl.

703
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,413
Come on, we gotta hit the road.

704
00:47:54,285 --> 00:47:56,276
ls this your stuff?

705
00:47:58,789 --> 00:48:03,089
l don't know why l let you talk me
into this, but it is a pretty day.

706
00:48:19,176 --> 00:48:21,736
-Bye.
-Bye.

707
00:48:24,815 --> 00:48:26,646
l know those greens
are good today, huh?

708
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:28,408
Sure enough is.

709
00:48:32,056 --> 00:48:34,354
Why do you keep calling me?

710
00:48:34,558 --> 00:48:36,992
Ben told me about all that money
you got in the bank.

711
00:48:37,194 --> 00:48:38,855
And?

712
00:48:39,363 --> 00:48:41,991
l just want to make sure it's legit,
Andrea.

713
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:43,996
And why is it
any of your damn business?

714
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:45,691
Because Mama got you that job...

715
00:48:45,903 --> 00:48:47,871
...that's what makes it
my damn business.

716
00:48:48,072 --> 00:48:50,438
l get bonuses, okay?

717
00:48:50,641 --> 00:48:53,303
-Hey, Pam.
-Oh, God.

718
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:55,239
-Don't you see us talking?
-Andrea.

719
00:48:55,446 --> 00:48:56,606
-Yeah.
-l gotta get my son.

720
00:48:56,814 --> 00:48:58,679
-Hi, Nick.
-Sorry.

721
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:01,341
Hi, Nick, are you okay?

722
00:49:01,552 --> 00:49:05,511
-Where's Alice?
-She's not here. She's out of town.

723
00:49:06,824 --> 00:49:08,815
Want something to eat?
l can get you something.

724
00:49:09,026 --> 00:49:12,462
-No.
-Nick. Nick.

725
00:49:12,763 --> 00:49:13,855
Bye.

726
00:49:14,064 --> 00:49:15,998
-l'm not done with you.
-l'm done with you.

727
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,828
Bye, baby. Oh, yeah, okay.

728
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:21,295
Now, mama told me
to take good care of you.

729
00:49:21,505 --> 00:49:23,632
-l'm okay.
-Nick, you know she's gonna call.

730
00:49:23,841 --> 00:49:26,435
She's gonna wanna know
if you've been by and been eating.

731
00:49:26,644 --> 00:49:29,636
And we don't want
to disappoint her, right?

732
00:49:29,847 --> 00:49:32,338
-Yeah, okay. All right, all right, l'll eat.
-Okay.

733
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:36,076
-And wash up too, right?
-Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and wash up.

734
00:49:36,287 --> 00:49:38,517
-Yeah. Come on.
-Okay.

735
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,487
This is delicious. l don't know why
you didn't get one of these.

736
00:50:13,691 --> 00:50:17,718
l ain't drinking nothing
named after a natural disaster.

737
00:50:18,429 --> 00:50:20,795
When's the last time
you even had a drink?

738
00:50:20,998 --> 00:50:24,297
Maybe l ain't never had a drink,
Miss Nosy.

739
00:50:24,501 --> 00:50:28,733
l wanna know. l know you had a drink
somewhere back 85 years ago.

740
00:50:28,939 --> 00:50:30,668
You the one drinking a Hurricane.

741
00:50:30,874 --> 00:50:33,638
That stuff gonna tear your life up
and flood you with misery.

742
00:50:33,844 --> 00:50:36,438
That's why they call it that.
You fool enough to buy one.

743
00:50:36,647 --> 00:50:39,207
-Alice.
-l ain't having that.

744
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:43,045
Sir? Sir, would you mind
taking our picture, please?

745
00:50:43,253 --> 00:50:46,745
-Of course.
-Thank you.

746
00:50:46,957 --> 00:50:50,051
-You naughty thing.
-Okay.

747
00:50:50,494 --> 00:50:51,518
-Are you smiling?
-Yeah.

748
00:50:51,729 --> 00:50:53,629
-One more.
-Smile.

749
00:50:57,668 --> 00:51:00,034
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you so much.

750
00:51:00,237 --> 00:51:02,569
Oh, wow, that is so cute.

751
00:51:02,773 --> 00:51:06,038
l'm supposed to be country. You done
took a picture every five minutes.

752
00:51:06,243 --> 00:51:07,835
lt's because l wanna remember this.

753
00:51:08,045 --> 00:51:11,139
You got enough pictures
to remember a lifetime.

754
00:51:11,348 --> 00:51:13,282
l hope so.

755
00:51:22,126 --> 00:51:23,889
-Hello.
-Hello.

756
00:51:24,094 --> 00:51:26,961
l was wondering
if my wife was around.

757
00:51:27,164 --> 00:51:28,927
-Your wife?
-Yeah.

758
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:30,828
Andrea Bennett?

759
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:34,437
-Okay.
-Okay.

760
00:51:34,638 --> 00:51:36,265
Sure, l'll see if she's still here.

761
00:51:36,473 --> 00:51:40,273
She usually has a standing
appointment every Wednesday with....

762
00:51:41,044 --> 00:51:43,137
-l'll check.
-Okay.

763
00:51:43,347 --> 00:51:45,542
-Chris.
-Hey, baby.

764
00:51:45,749 --> 00:51:47,307
What are you doing here?

765
00:51:47,518 --> 00:51:53,218
Well, l wanted to come down
and apologize again. l'm sorry.

766
00:51:53,424 --> 00:51:57,952
Oh, that's fine. lt's fine.
Now, you have to go back to work.

767
00:51:58,162 --> 00:52:00,687
Yeah, well l just wanted
to take you out to lunch, baby.

768
00:52:00,898 --> 00:52:03,958
-Today's not a good day.
-ls there a problem with the site?

769
00:52:04,535 --> 00:52:07,936
No, Mr. Cartwright.
This gentleman was just leaving.

770
00:52:08,138 --> 00:52:10,504
Hey, Mr. Cartwright. Chris.

771
00:52:10,707 --> 00:52:13,301
-Andrea's husband.
-lt's been a long time. How you doing?

772
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:15,501
-Yeah.
-Hi. l'm Abigayle Dexter.

773
00:52:15,712 --> 00:52:16,940
Abigayle. Nice to meet you.

774
00:52:17,147 --> 00:52:19,138
Andrea, l didn't know
that you were married.

775
00:52:21,852 --> 00:52:23,911
So l guess we'll be seeing you
at the gala.

776
00:52:24,555 --> 00:52:26,216
Gala?

777
00:52:26,423 --> 00:52:28,357
The opening of the Prestige building.

778
00:52:29,993 --> 00:52:31,893
No....

779
00:52:32,663 --> 00:52:35,063
-She didn't tell me about that, so l....
-Oh.

780
00:52:36,099 --> 00:52:37,361
Shame on you, Andrea.

781
00:52:39,169 --> 00:52:40,329
Well, you should be there.

782
00:52:40,537 --> 00:52:42,971
-Okay. l will.
-Nice meeting you.

783
00:52:43,173 --> 00:52:45,573
-You too. You too.
-Okay.

784
00:52:46,343 --> 00:52:49,005
-Everything's going well out there?
-Yeah, Mr. Cartwright.

785
00:52:49,213 --> 00:52:51,078
Everything's going well
down at the site.

786
00:52:51,281 --> 00:52:53,772
Good. Let me know
if you need anything, okay?

787
00:52:53,984 --> 00:52:55,815
-Well, actually, Mr. Cartwright--
-Chris.

788
00:52:56,019 --> 00:52:57,452
Yeah?

789
00:52:59,623 --> 00:53:02,615
-What is it?
-lt's probably nothing.

790
00:53:02,826 --> 00:53:04,885
Let him talk. What is it?

791
00:53:05,596 --> 00:53:12,263
Well, l just wanted
to run a few ideas by you, that's all.

792
00:53:12,469 --> 00:53:15,927
Robin, give us 1 5 minutes in between
our meeting. Come to my office.

793
00:53:16,139 --> 00:53:19,438
-Let's talk.
-Yeah. Yeah, sure.

794
00:53:21,712 --> 00:53:22,838
Hello?

795
00:53:23,046 --> 00:53:25,776
Yes, your appointment
is going to be 1 5 minutes late.

796
00:53:31,688 --> 00:53:35,215
l'm so glad you decided
to come with me.

797
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:38,891
l am too.

798
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:46,565
l must admit though, at first l thought
you had lost your mind, but this is fun.

799
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:49,295
-So where are we going next?
-l don't know.

800
00:53:49,506 --> 00:53:51,838
That's the beauty of it.
We get up and drive...

801
00:53:52,042 --> 00:53:54,442
...and just wake up and go
wherever we want.

802
00:53:54,645 --> 00:53:59,014
Okay, but it would be kind of nice
to know what direction we're going in.

803
00:53:59,216 --> 00:54:00,444
West. We're going west.

804
00:54:00,651 --> 00:54:05,020
We're gonna sleep in fleabag motels
and eat at truck stops...

805
00:54:05,222 --> 00:54:08,419
...and hang out
with all the regular folk.

806
00:54:09,126 --> 00:54:12,152
You know, l been regular all my life.
lt ain't nothing new to me.

807
00:54:12,362 --> 00:54:16,696
But l wanna see you stay one night
in a motel.

808
00:54:18,201 --> 00:54:19,634
Lord have mercy.

809
00:54:19,836 --> 00:54:22,100
Alice, l can go with the flow.

810
00:54:22,472 --> 00:54:25,168
Yeah, l bet you can.

811
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:34,073
My child ain't speaking to me
because l didn't promote him.

812
00:54:35,285 --> 00:54:36,980
Why didn't you promote him?

813
00:54:37,187 --> 00:54:39,621
Well, let's not forget the hell
he put me through.

814
00:54:39,823 --> 00:54:42,519
Four years at Harvard
and three years in rehab.

815
00:54:42,726 --> 00:54:47,095
Yeah, but he got it together. l told you
he would. Don't be so hard on him.

816
00:54:47,297 --> 00:54:49,390
He ain't got it yet.

817
00:54:50,233 --> 00:54:52,793
Sometimes you gotta let them go
for them to get it.

818
00:54:54,571 --> 00:54:58,405
Sometimes you say the simplest
things, and it means so much.

819
00:54:58,609 --> 00:55:00,736
lt's just the truth.

820
00:55:01,545 --> 00:55:04,742
l raised mine up, but they'll kill me.

821
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:07,744
Amen.

822
00:55:08,352 --> 00:55:10,343
Amen.

823
00:55:10,954 --> 00:55:13,855
You know what? Don't say ''Amen''
while you're sucking on that.

824
00:55:14,057 --> 00:55:16,048
God! Dog.

825
00:55:16,827 --> 00:55:19,728
-l feel closer to heaven when l drink.
-Shame on you.

826
00:55:26,036 --> 00:55:27,526
Sit down.

827
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:35,945
So how can l help you?

828
00:55:36,513 --> 00:55:40,279
Well, Mr. Cartwright, l....

829
00:55:40,884 --> 00:55:43,114
You know, l was thinking about...

830
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:46,118
...starting my own
construction company.

831
00:55:46,323 --> 00:55:49,190
Much smaller than this, of course,
you know.

832
00:55:50,093 --> 00:55:53,028
Of course, of course.
Well, you gotta start somewhere.

833
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:54,629
Well....

834
00:55:55,065 --> 00:55:58,728
And l was wondering
maybe you would like to...

835
00:55:59,536 --> 00:56:01,401
...invest.

836
00:56:04,474 --> 00:56:05,532
lnvest?

837
00:56:08,145 --> 00:56:09,737
lnvest, yeah. Yeah.

838
00:56:10,247 --> 00:56:12,875
Okay. Well, do you
have any other investors?

839
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:17,816
Well, none.
You are the first person l....

840
00:56:18,288 --> 00:56:21,121
You know l work very closely
with your wife.

841
00:56:21,324 --> 00:56:24,054
And l'll get back to you through her.
How about that?

842
00:56:24,294 --> 00:56:26,819
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

843
00:56:27,597 --> 00:56:29,087
Okay.

844
00:56:32,569 --> 00:56:34,161
Thank you.

845
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,466
Hey, Robin?
Hey, Chris, hold on one second.

846
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:43,140
Your wife is doing an amazing job.

847
00:56:45,649 --> 00:56:47,241
Thank you.

848
00:56:49,052 --> 00:56:53,113
Robin, let them know
l'll be there in 1 0, okay?

849
00:56:53,323 --> 00:56:54,620
Thanks.

850
00:58:07,998 --> 00:58:09,397
You got enough cameras?

851
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,695
Well, if the digital thingy fails,
then these are the backups.

852
00:58:14,337 --> 00:58:15,531
Are we lost yet?

853
00:58:15,739 --> 00:58:17,366
No, we're not lost.

854
00:58:17,574 --> 00:58:21,635
We are approximately
346 miles from Las Vegas.

855
00:58:21,845 --> 00:58:23,710
-Let's get a drink.
-Do you want the Coke?

856
00:58:23,914 --> 00:58:25,905
No, l mean a real one.

857
00:58:26,349 --> 00:58:27,373
Sheryl Ann, let's go.

858
00:58:28,819 --> 00:58:34,189
-Oh, no, l'm not going up in there.
-Oh, come on. lt'll be fun.

859
00:58:34,391 --> 00:58:36,416
-No, it won't.
-Yes, it will.

860
00:58:36,626 --> 00:58:41,188
Darling you, like l am,
are bored with your life...

861
00:58:41,398 --> 00:58:44,162
...and you need just a little bit
of adventure, l think.

862
00:58:44,367 --> 00:58:46,232
l'm not bored.

863
00:58:46,436 --> 00:58:48,700
Charlotte, l'm not going in.

864
00:58:48,905 --> 00:58:51,305
Yes, you are. You're coming with me.

865
00:58:51,508 --> 00:58:55,842
-No.
-You'll be safe. l'll be with you.

866
00:58:56,046 --> 00:58:58,844
Look who's out front though.

867
00:58:59,282 --> 00:59:02,376
l know, that looks like my Uncle Ted.

868
00:59:07,357 --> 00:59:10,451
l'd like two, please. Thank you.

869
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:13,857
Here's your ticket, l got mine.
This is so great.

870
00:59:14,064 --> 00:59:17,830
-l put my money in church.
-They got live music.

871
00:59:19,436 --> 00:59:21,336
Excuse me.

872
00:59:22,138 --> 00:59:26,666
Oh, my God. Look, that woman's
got a-- She's got a flag for a shirt.

873
00:59:28,078 --> 00:59:32,572
Come on, we'll just have
one drink, Alice. That can't hurt.

874
00:59:33,483 --> 00:59:34,711
-What'll it be?
-Water.

875
00:59:34,918 --> 00:59:39,014
-Two shots of tequila.
-Two shots of water.

876
00:59:55,972 --> 00:59:58,532
William, the board will be happy
to have you in charge.

877
00:59:59,142 --> 01:00:01,076
-Thank you.
-Ma'am.

878
01:00:01,444 --> 01:00:03,071
Have a good evening.

879
01:00:03,446 --> 01:00:05,141
What was that about?

880
01:00:05,348 --> 01:00:08,749
The board and l have decided
to vote my mother out.

881
01:00:12,155 --> 01:00:14,487
Hello, William. This must be your wife.

882
01:00:14,691 --> 01:00:16,318
-Yes, yes.
-Abby Dexter.

883
01:00:16,526 --> 01:00:18,460
-Hi, Jillian Cartwright.
-Nice to meet you.

884
01:00:18,662 --> 01:00:20,459

886
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:25,066
-Nice to meet you.
-There's a lot of excitement here.

887
01:00:25,268 --> 01:00:27,498
Yeah. Enjoy your evening.

888
01:00:31,074 --> 01:00:32,905
Andrea.

889
01:00:33,209 --> 01:00:35,040
Hello, Mrs. Cartwright.

890
01:00:36,513 --> 01:00:39,676
That's a lovely necklace.

891
01:00:40,417 --> 01:00:43,011
Not as lovely as yours.

892
01:00:44,621 --> 01:00:47,647
Excuse me, the mayor's here.
Excuse me.

893
01:00:54,264 --> 01:00:58,291
Well, hey, Mrs. Cartwright.
l'm Andrea's husband.

894
01:00:58,501 --> 01:01:00,867
-Chris, right?
-Yeah. Yeah, Chris. Chris.

895
01:01:01,271 --> 01:01:02,738
How are you?

896
01:01:03,807 --> 01:01:06,571
l'm good. l'm-- Yeah. l'm real good.

897
01:01:07,143 --> 01:01:08,667
Well, you look very handsome.

898
01:01:09,813 --> 01:01:12,748
-Thank you.
-You're quite the couple.

899
01:01:12,949 --> 01:01:14,177
Enjoy.

900
01:01:19,756 --> 01:01:22,156
Wow, baby, this place is really nice.

901
01:01:22,359 --> 01:01:25,055
Please don't do anything
to embarrass me.

902
01:01:25,261 --> 01:01:28,719
-What are you talking about?
-Just don't talk to anybody.

903
01:01:28,932 --> 01:01:30,832
Oh, baby--

904
01:01:35,505 --> 01:01:37,473
Here you go, ma'am.

905
01:01:39,676 --> 01:01:42,645
-Have they got a bull?
-No.

906
01:01:45,048 --> 01:01:48,950
So, what are two nice, pretty,
little fillies doing in a place like this?

907
01:01:49,152 --> 01:01:51,518
Who said we're nice?

908
01:01:52,355 --> 01:01:53,481
Hi, l'm Sam Walton.

909
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:55,317
Like Wal-Mart?

910
01:01:55,525 --> 01:01:56,958
Well, not quite, ma'am.

911
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:00,391
l'm Thelma
and this is my friend Louise.

912
01:02:00,597 --> 01:02:01,621
Howdy.

913
01:02:01,965 --> 01:02:05,128
Howdy.
Well, that wasn't quite fair, was it?

914
01:02:05,335 --> 01:02:08,202
l mean, l gave you my name
but you didn't give me yours.

915
01:02:08,405 --> 01:02:10,999
l'm Alice and this is Charlotte.

916
01:02:11,674 --> 01:02:13,369
-Hi, Charlotte.
-Hey.

917
01:02:13,576 --> 01:02:16,067
So you two running from the law?

918
01:02:16,279 --> 01:02:18,406
Not quite.
Me and my good friend here...

919
01:02:18,615 --> 01:02:21,277
...we're driving
across this great country of ours.

920
01:02:21,484 --> 01:02:24,146
That's great. Enjoy life while you can.

921
01:02:25,989 --> 01:02:27,980
You can say that again.

922
01:02:28,191 --> 01:02:31,319
-So how'd you all meet up?
-You sure ask a lot of questions.

923
01:02:31,528 --> 01:02:34,497
-We're friendly around these parts.
-Well, if you must know...

924
01:02:34,697 --> 01:02:38,633
...my husband was doing a
developmental deal in an urban area...

925
01:02:38,835 --> 01:02:41,303
...and she refused to sell.

926
01:02:41,504 --> 01:02:45,133
So he sent me in
to sweet-talk her into it.

927
01:02:45,341 --> 01:02:48,799
l've never met anybody
as strong-willed in all my life.

928
01:02:49,379 --> 01:02:53,873
We've been friends ever since.
That was 30 years ago.

929
01:02:54,084 --> 01:02:57,178
-She's seen me through two divorces.
-Three.

930
01:02:58,021 --> 01:02:59,386
-Three?
-Three.

931
01:03:01,191 --> 01:03:04,752
Oh, right. l tried to forget that one.

932
01:03:04,961 --> 01:03:09,193
Well, Miss Three-Time-Divorced
Little Lady...

933
01:03:10,033 --> 01:03:11,295
...will you dance with me?

934
01:03:12,435 --> 01:03:17,338
-Why, l don't mind if l do, cowboy.
-Thank you, ma'am.

935
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:19,235
Don't let him be number four.

936
01:03:35,959 --> 01:03:37,893
Hey, you wanna dance?

937
01:03:38,628 --> 01:03:40,152
You know how to holy dance?

938
01:03:40,363 --> 01:03:42,331
The holy dance? No. No, l don't.

939
01:03:42,532 --> 01:03:46,161
l didn't think you did, either.
Keep on stepping.

940
01:04:05,655 --> 01:04:07,782
Yeah, l know.

941
01:04:08,925 --> 01:04:10,722
Hey. Chris, right?

942
01:04:11,461 --> 01:04:16,125
Yeah. Yeah, you know what?
Have you seen my wife?

943
01:04:17,133 --> 01:04:22,435
No, l haven't.
Maybe she's with William.

944
01:04:28,611 --> 01:04:30,602
Who's William?

945
01:04:32,782 --> 01:04:35,273
l'm calling you a taxi.
You've had too much to drink.

946
01:04:35,485 --> 01:04:37,385
-No. l'm good.
-No, you're not good.

947
01:04:37,587 --> 01:04:39,987
l'm trying to help you here.
Help you keep your job.

948
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:43,057
Oh, okay. Fine, then.

949
01:04:43,259 --> 01:04:45,454
l mean, all l'm doing is
just a little drinking.

950
01:04:45,662 --> 01:04:49,758
lt's not like l'm upstairs with William
like Andrea is...

951
01:04:49,966 --> 01:04:52,127
...with my husband looking for me.

952
01:04:52,535 --> 01:04:54,400
You know what l'm saying?

953
01:04:54,971 --> 01:04:56,461
Time to go.

954
01:04:56,673 --> 01:05:00,473
Your husband's been talking to banks
about starting his own company.

955
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:03,578
And people have told me
that he's tried to contact...

956
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:05,441
...some of our competition for help.

957
01:05:05,782 --> 01:05:07,511
Well...

958
01:05:08,117 --> 01:05:10,415
...he can be persistent.

959
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:14,750
Yeah, well, l don't like it.
lt's not good for business.

960
01:05:14,958 --> 01:05:17,085
So l'm gonna fire him.

961
01:05:17,293 --> 01:05:18,851
Good.

962
01:05:20,129 --> 01:05:23,792
More ammunition for me to leave him.

963
01:05:24,901 --> 01:05:29,201
-You are evil, you know that?
-You love it.

964
01:05:48,291 --> 01:05:51,021
Excuse me, Mrs. Cartwright.
Have you seen my wife?

965
01:05:51,227 --> 01:05:53,525
She's with my husband.

966
01:06:00,503 --> 01:06:04,997
-You enjoying yourself?
-Yes. Yeah, l am.

967
01:06:06,476 --> 01:06:08,171
Baby, where in the hell
have you been?

968
01:06:08,378 --> 01:06:10,778
He needed some files.
Come on, let's go.

969
01:06:43,446 --> 01:06:46,210
You left the party early, Jillian.

970
01:06:52,555 --> 01:06:54,455
Do you love her?

971
01:07:06,336 --> 01:07:08,304
What did you say?

972
01:07:16,813 --> 01:07:18,508
Do you love...

973
01:07:19,949 --> 01:07:21,541
...her?

974
01:07:34,464 --> 01:07:36,295
l love you.

975
01:07:45,308 --> 01:07:51,804
You won't even answer my question.

976
01:08:04,761 --> 01:08:07,195
l answered your question.

977
01:08:30,553 --> 01:08:32,646
Good morning.

978
01:08:36,459 --> 01:08:38,654
Where we at?

979
01:08:39,028 --> 01:08:42,623
You said just go west,
and we going west.

980
01:08:42,965 --> 01:08:44,057
Oh, l tell you...

981
01:08:44,267 --> 01:08:48,601
...these seats aren't as comfortable
as they were when l was a girl.

982
01:08:48,805 --> 01:08:51,740
Because you was always
on your back in them.

983
01:08:51,941 --> 01:08:54,341
Listen to you.

984
01:09:00,349 --> 01:09:01,338
-Charlotte.
-Yeah.

985
01:09:01,551 --> 01:09:05,112
-This trip about both of us, ain't it?
-Yeah.

986
01:09:05,922 --> 01:09:09,483
Well, it's my turn, darling.

987
01:09:10,126 --> 01:09:14,893
-There is no way.
-Oh, way.

988
01:09:15,097 --> 01:09:18,191
-Alice.
-Come on, trust me.

989
01:09:23,039 --> 01:09:25,132
You don't even know
what denomination they are.

990
01:09:25,341 --> 01:09:28,071
lt don't matter what denomination
you are if it's about God.

991
01:09:28,277 --> 01:09:30,871
-Don't pull in so close. No, Alice.
-lt's okay.

992
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:35,540
No. Alice. We're gonna get
in such trouble.

993
01:09:35,818 --> 01:09:38,218
-What?
-Come on, let's go. Come on.

994
01:09:38,421 --> 01:09:42,380
Alice. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

995
01:09:42,658 --> 01:09:45,684
Be quiet. Be very quiet.
Let's just stand in the back.

996
01:09:45,895 --> 01:09:47,556
Let's just stand in the back.

997
01:09:47,763 --> 01:09:50,891
Come on. No, no. Come on. No, Alice.

998
01:09:51,834 --> 01:09:54,132
lt's a sin to cut in front
of all these people.

999
01:09:54,337 --> 01:09:55,929
They let the big sinners up.

1000
01:09:56,138 --> 01:09:57,935
-Hallelujah.
-Hallelujah.

1001
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:01,041
Pastor, me and my friend
were just driving across country...

1002
01:10:01,577 --> 01:10:04,978
...and she ain't never been baptized.
And we was just wondering--

1003
01:10:05,181 --> 01:10:07,445
l know why you're here.
Come on, child.

1004
01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:10,210
You kidding me? This is St. John.

1005
01:10:10,419 --> 01:10:13,718
lt's named after Saint John the Baptist.
Come on.

1006
01:10:13,923 --> 01:10:18,383
-Wade in the water, Charlotte.
-Wait, wait, wait.

1007
01:10:19,262 --> 01:10:22,629
-lt's okay. Come on. Get in there.
-l'm gonna break my neck.

1008
01:10:22,832 --> 01:10:24,299
Go on.

1009
01:10:24,634 --> 01:10:27,501
What about your heavy glasses?

1010
01:10:27,870 --> 01:10:29,735
Too late.

1011
01:10:32,108 --> 01:10:33,735
Get in.

1012
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:36,137
Don't let go.

1013
01:10:37,547 --> 01:10:39,606
lt's freezing.

1014
01:10:46,355 --> 01:10:50,052
-Hallelujah.
-Hallelujah.

1015
01:10:56,365 --> 01:10:59,357
Grab my arm. Grab my arm.

1016
01:11:00,436 --> 01:11:03,530
Alice Evans, l need a drink.

1017
01:11:03,739 --> 01:11:05,866
-No, you don't.
-No, you go to hell.

1018
01:11:06,075 --> 01:11:09,238
-We ain't going to hell. We're saved.
-Oh, good.

1019
01:11:09,445 --> 01:11:12,539
-l'm going, anyway.
-l'm so proud of you.

1020
01:11:23,225 --> 01:11:24,715
-Hi.
-Hi.

1021
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:27,293
-Thanks for the other night.
-Don't mention it.

1022
01:11:27,496 --> 01:11:28,986
Good morning.

1023
01:11:29,365 --> 01:11:31,162
Good morning.

1024
01:11:32,034 --> 01:11:33,023
Andrea.

1025
01:11:34,537 --> 01:11:36,801
Do you think l can see you
for a moment, please?

1026
01:11:37,006 --> 01:11:38,564
Sure.

1027
01:11:46,849 --> 01:11:49,409
-l think you do a great job here.
-Thank you.

1028
01:11:49,619 --> 01:11:52,816
But as l've been evaluating your
performance and going over records...

1029
01:11:53,022 --> 01:11:56,719
...l've come across some things that
concern me.

1030
01:11:56,926 --> 01:11:59,656
-Such as?
-Just don't know about something.

1031
01:11:59,862 --> 01:12:01,830
-What is that?
-You know we have a strict...

1032
01:12:02,031 --> 01:12:05,228
-...no-fraternization policy here, right?
-l'm very aware of it.

1033
01:12:05,434 --> 01:12:06,662
l've been here four years.

1034
01:12:06,869 --> 01:12:09,064
Well, the things that concern me are...

1035
01:12:09,271 --> 01:12:13,264
...several thousand dollars of
purchases that seem to be personal.

1036
01:12:13,476 --> 01:12:16,570
Hotel stays every Wednesday.

1037
01:12:17,847 --> 01:12:19,712
Things on Mr. Cartwright's
credit card...

1038
01:12:19,915 --> 01:12:23,112
...that seem to coincide with
your time spent away from the office.

1039
01:12:23,319 --> 01:12:24,513
What are you getting at?

1040
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:27,280
-You having an affair with Cartwright?
-No.

1041
01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:30,789
l was so hoping that
you were gonna be honest with me.

1042
01:12:31,427 --> 01:12:36,364
-l can't protect you if you're gonna lie.
-l don't need you to protect me.

1043
01:12:36,565 --> 01:12:39,966
-And you think he will?
-l know he will.

1044
01:12:40,403 --> 01:12:42,371
Mr. Cartwright is the not
the type of man...

1045
01:12:42,571 --> 01:12:44,732
...that will take orders
from the likes of you.

1046
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:47,875
You just got here.
You better watch your step.

1047
01:12:48,077 --> 01:12:50,375
lt is sisters like you
that give us all a bad name.

1048
01:12:50,579 --> 01:12:53,446
Screwing your way to the top
instead of doing it the right way.

1049
01:12:53,649 --> 01:12:54,741
The right way.

1050
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:58,477
The right way is graduating
top of my class...

1051
01:12:58,688 --> 01:13:02,488
...getting my masters and helping
this company report record profits...

1052
01:13:02,692 --> 01:13:05,160
...in two and a half of the four years
l've been here.

1053
01:13:05,561 --> 01:13:10,191
Affair or not, l'm doing it the right way.

1054
01:13:11,667 --> 01:13:15,467
So, Abigayle,
who did you screw to get here?

1055
01:13:15,971 --> 01:13:20,670
Unlike you, l have worked my ass off
to prove that l'm just as good...

1056
01:13:20,876 --> 01:13:25,904
...if not better than my counterparts.
What you are doing, Andrea...

1057
01:13:26,115 --> 01:13:28,640
...will get you there
but it will not keep you.

1058
01:13:29,151 --> 01:13:32,314
-We're gonna have to let you go.
-We'll see about that.

1059
01:13:32,521 --> 01:13:36,651
-He has no authority to keep you here.
-And you have no authority...

1060
01:13:36,859 --> 01:13:38,884
...to make me leave.

1061
01:13:43,933 --> 01:13:46,902
l love this song. You ever heard it?

1062
01:13:47,103 --> 01:13:49,401
l never heard it before.

1063
01:13:49,605 --> 01:13:51,505
Listen. Listen to the words.

1064
01:13:51,707 --> 01:13:57,009
Promise me that you'll give faith
A fighting chance

1065
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:03,411
And when you get the choice
To sit it out or dance

1066
01:14:03,919 --> 01:14:05,011
l hope you dance

1067
01:14:05,221 --> 01:14:10,056
-That's beautiful.
-That's the way it is.

1068
01:14:11,026 --> 01:14:14,689
And we are gonna dance, my friend.
We are gonna dance.

1069
01:14:14,897 --> 01:14:16,091
Not butt-shaking dance.

1070
01:14:16,298 --> 01:14:20,098
No, but you have a dancer's heart,
my darling.

1071
01:14:25,808 --> 01:14:30,336
-Did you see that?
-Don't even think about it.

1072
01:14:30,813 --> 01:14:32,007
Hey.

1073
01:14:32,214 --> 01:14:34,239
-Come on, we gotta go.
-Oh, where's my Bible?

1074
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:36,781
Charlotte.

1075
01:14:37,787 --> 01:14:38,981
We've got to.

1076
01:14:39,889 --> 01:14:43,222
l'm not kidding, Charlotte. You better
slow down before you get a ticket.

1077
01:14:43,425 --> 01:14:46,690
Oh, officer. Officer.

1078
01:14:49,298 --> 01:14:53,098
-Look. Look.
-Oh, Lord.

1079
01:14:59,542 --> 01:15:03,034
Hey, baby.
You wanna rub oil on my body?

1080
01:15:03,913 --> 01:15:07,371
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. l'd like that.
l'd like that.

1081
01:15:07,583 --> 01:15:09,915
Father, Son and the Holy Ghost.

1082
01:15:10,119 --> 01:15:12,815
Some oil for your little....

1083
01:15:21,330 --> 01:15:23,696
Come on, stick it out there.
Stick it out there.

1084
01:15:25,668 --> 01:15:28,102
l thought so.

1085
01:15:42,852 --> 01:15:45,582
Yeah, baby.

1086
01:15:46,722 --> 01:15:49,555
You'd better wash your hands
when you get out of here.

1087
01:15:49,758 --> 01:15:51,658
Wash your hands
when we get out of here.

1088
01:15:51,861 --> 01:15:53,226
Okay, l will.

1089
01:16:33,869 --> 01:16:35,700
Hey, Charlotte.

1090
01:16:38,908 --> 01:16:40,603
Charlotte.

1091
01:16:43,012 --> 01:16:46,004
-What are you doing?
-l can't load this camera.

1092
01:16:46,215 --> 01:16:49,446
lt says-- Keeps just saying,
''Memory full''.

1093
01:16:49,652 --> 01:16:53,782
-Honey, it's the--
-Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

1094
01:16:53,989 --> 01:16:55,616
Look at me.

1095
01:16:57,726 --> 01:16:59,489
What is it?

1096
01:17:01,430 --> 01:17:02,829
Alice.

1097
01:17:03,432 --> 01:17:06,629
Yeah. W--? What?

1098
01:17:06,835 --> 01:17:08,894
lt's Saturday.

1099
01:17:09,805 --> 01:17:13,901
Well, actually,
it's 3:00 Sunday morning.

1100
01:17:14,109 --> 01:17:17,840
But yesterday was Friday
and we danced.

1101
01:17:18,847 --> 01:17:23,147
Yeah, we did. We danced
all night long. Sweetie, what is it?

1102
01:17:23,585 --> 01:17:25,553
Are you okay?

1103
01:17:27,623 --> 01:17:30,751
-Were you having a bad dream?
-No.

1104
01:17:31,961 --> 01:17:33,519
What is it?

1105
01:17:33,729 --> 01:17:37,495
The memory is full on this camera.

1106
01:17:38,434 --> 01:17:40,334
Let me see it.

1107
01:17:41,837 --> 01:17:46,035
You know, we could get a--
We can get a new memory card.

1108
01:17:49,244 --> 01:17:52,042
Oh, l wish it was that simple.

1109
01:17:53,515 --> 01:17:56,143
Memory card is full.

1110
01:18:00,456 --> 01:18:03,516
l have early onset Alzheimer's.

1111
01:18:12,968 --> 01:18:15,994
The doctors say
there's nothing they can do.

1112
01:18:19,675 --> 01:18:22,041
Did you get a second opinion?

1113
01:18:23,312 --> 01:18:27,874
Three. They all said the same thing.

1114
01:18:33,856 --> 01:18:38,384
No. lt's gonna be all right, Charlotte.

1115
01:18:41,163 --> 01:18:42,994
Not this time.

1116
01:18:43,966 --> 01:18:49,905
Oh, we've been through a lot of things
together, Alice. But not this time.

1117
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:53,336
lt's not gonna be all right this time.

1118
01:18:55,611 --> 01:18:58,171
Don't let my son put me away.

1119
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:00,348
l won't.

1120
01:19:03,519 --> 01:19:05,453
And you mustn't tell anyone.

1121
01:19:06,055 --> 01:19:10,253
-You promise?
-l promise, l won't.

1122
01:19:12,728 --> 01:19:15,595
And when l start to forget...

1123
01:19:15,798 --> 01:19:18,232
...will you help me remember?

1124
01:19:20,469 --> 01:19:23,131
Yes, l will. l will.

1125
01:19:24,106 --> 01:19:26,301
Of course l will.

1126
01:19:28,343 --> 01:19:30,504
l wanna go home.

1127
01:19:30,712 --> 01:19:33,909
-Will you take me home?
-Okay.

1128
01:19:34,116 --> 01:19:35,811
You're okay.

1129
01:19:59,808 --> 01:20:02,902
-Hey, Joey.
-Won't be needing you guys anymore.

1130
01:20:03,112 --> 01:20:07,446
-Ben, Chris, your last checks.
-What the hell you talking about, man?

1131
01:20:07,649 --> 01:20:10,049
-What's going on?
-The tools belong to the company.

1132
01:20:10,252 --> 01:20:12,720
Wait a minute, is Cartwright here?
Does he know this?

1133
01:20:12,921 --> 01:20:15,321
He's out today. He knows.

1134
01:20:15,524 --> 01:20:18,687
Joe, man. Come on, what happened?

1135
01:20:24,366 --> 01:20:25,993
-Well, did they say why?
-No.

1136
01:20:26,201 --> 01:20:29,295
lt's probably all this talk about us
starting our own company.

1137
01:20:29,505 --> 01:20:31,097
-No.
-Who you talk to at that party?

1138
01:20:31,306 --> 01:20:35,140
-l didn't talk to anybody at the party.
-Do you know what kind of position...

1139
01:20:35,344 --> 01:20:37,175
-...that puts us in?
-Ben, don't. Just--

1140
01:20:37,379 --> 01:20:42,942
No, no, no. No, he needs to know this.
Car payment, mortgage and no job?

1141
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:48,653
l was doing fine,
we were on our feet and you....

1142
01:20:49,391 --> 01:20:51,382
-lt's okay.
-Look, listen.

1143
01:20:51,593 --> 01:20:55,154
Maybe this is just a sign that we need
to go into our own business.

1144
01:20:55,364 --> 01:20:57,389
And you're still talking about this.

1145
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:03,436
You listen to me.
Get your head out of the clouds.

1146
01:21:03,739 --> 01:21:07,436
lt ain't gonna happen.
This ain't no damn sign. lt's over.

1147
01:21:07,876 --> 01:21:10,709
Man, look,
l already made some moves.

1148
01:21:10,913 --> 01:21:13,143
How have you made moves, man?
You ain't got money.

1149
01:21:13,348 --> 01:21:15,839
So it's either you're in or you're out.

1150
01:21:16,051 --> 01:21:18,417
What kind of moves you made?
You ain't got no money.

1151
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:19,951
Chris, what the hell?

1152
01:21:20,389 --> 01:21:22,687
-What is with--? Andrea.
-Hey, baby.

1153
01:21:22,891 --> 01:21:24,882
Hon, listen, let me explain, okay?

1154
01:21:25,093 --> 01:21:28,221
-l took all the money out of the bank.
-l know that.

1155
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:31,797
l opened a business account. We're
gonna go into business for ourselves.

1156
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,401
-You did what?
-Ben and l got fired today.

1157
01:21:35,604 --> 01:21:39,802
l just think that's a sign that we should
just go into business on our own.

1158
01:21:40,008 --> 01:21:42,841
-That is my money.
-Yeah, but we're in this together, right?

1159
01:21:43,045 --> 01:21:46,378
No, no. l'm in this.
You go get my money back.

1160
01:21:46,582 --> 01:21:48,516
lt's a little bit too late.

1161
01:21:49,284 --> 01:21:51,809
The majority of the deposits
went out this morning.

1162
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:55,820
You bastard. You just take my money
without asking me?

1163
01:21:56,024 --> 01:22:00,290
No, baby, this is gonna work out
for the best. Trust me on that, okay?

1164
01:22:00,495 --> 01:22:05,330
You know what?
l am getting so sick of you.

1165
01:22:05,567 --> 01:22:09,867
l am so tired of supporting
this whole family by myself.

1166
01:22:10,439 --> 01:22:13,602
l thought a man was supposed
to help a woman.

1167
01:22:16,378 --> 01:22:21,213
-You are so weak. Both of you.
-Today ain't the day and l ain't the one.

1168
01:22:21,416 --> 01:22:22,610
You understand me?

1169
01:22:22,818 --> 01:22:24,683
What are you gonna do
with your broke ass?

1170
01:22:24,886 --> 01:22:26,751
-l got your broke-ass, trick.
-Go to hell.

1171
01:22:26,955 --> 01:22:29,822
-This is my wife you're talking to.
-Don't mean nothing to her.

1172
01:22:30,025 --> 01:22:31,390
What is that supposed to mean?

1173
01:22:31,593 --> 01:22:33,254
Yeah, what is that supposed to mean?

1174
01:22:33,462 --> 01:22:35,862
-You'd better get her, babes.
-Okay, l know.

1175
01:22:36,064 --> 01:22:38,965
-That's what l thought.
-Andrea, just drop it.

1176
01:22:39,167 --> 01:22:41,101
-You stole my money.
-Baby--

1177
01:22:41,303 --> 01:22:43,828
You and this loser
will never be William Cartwright.

1178
01:22:44,039 --> 01:22:47,839
For one, ain't nobody trying to be no
William Cartwright, you understand?

1179
01:22:48,043 --> 01:22:51,604
But you can't see that, because you're
so busy on his lap every night, right?

1180
01:22:51,813 --> 01:22:54,111
Oh, come on, man.
What are you talking about?

1181
01:22:54,316 --> 01:22:56,250
Chris, man, come on.
Everybody know, man.

1182
01:22:56,451 --> 01:23:00,080
They talking about you behind your
back at the site. Everybody know.

1183
01:23:00,289 --> 01:23:01,756
Baby, what is he talking about?

1184
01:23:01,957 --> 01:23:04,482
Now, come over here a second.
l need to talk a second.

1185
01:23:04,693 --> 01:23:07,093
-What's he talking about? Start talking.
-Fine.

1186
01:23:07,296 --> 01:23:11,494
All that money you stole from me
was given to me by William.

1187
01:23:14,136 --> 01:23:15,899
Why would he give you
so much money?

1188
01:23:16,104 --> 01:23:17,731
Oh, this--

1189
01:23:20,442 --> 01:23:23,741
Because he's my man, Chris.

1190
01:23:31,253 --> 01:23:32,584
-Chris.
-Wait a minute.

1191
01:23:32,788 --> 01:23:33,880
-Don't you--
-Stop it.

1192
01:23:34,089 --> 01:23:35,522
Who'd he slap so hard like that?

1193
01:23:35,724 --> 01:23:39,683
You've been making me feel like
the whole time that this is my fault...

1194
01:23:39,895 --> 01:23:43,422
...that l'm the one that's crazy, and
you been doing this the whole while.

1195
01:23:43,632 --> 01:23:45,224
You know what? Keep that money.

1196
01:23:45,434 --> 01:23:48,301
There's plenty more
where that came from.

1197
01:23:48,503 --> 01:23:51,438
ln fact, you know what?
Here's some more.

1198
01:23:51,907 --> 01:23:55,399
You go buy yourself some boxes
and get your stuff out of my house.

1199
01:23:56,878 --> 01:24:00,644
Five years we've been married
and you talk to me like that.

1200
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:03,611
And we've got a son.

1201
01:24:04,353 --> 01:24:06,253
What are you gonna tell him, huh?

1202
01:24:06,455 --> 01:24:10,858
My son is a Cartwright.

1203
01:24:53,802 --> 01:24:55,531
Jillian.

1204
01:24:55,871 --> 01:25:00,672
You are here in my rose garden.
And without calling.

1205
01:25:06,648 --> 01:25:08,980
Here, sit down.

1206
01:25:15,023 --> 01:25:19,483
lt must be something awful
if you came to see me, of all people.

1207
01:25:19,694 --> 01:25:21,491
William...

1208
01:25:24,065 --> 01:25:26,329
...is having an affair.

1209
01:25:27,769 --> 01:25:33,264
lt's been going on years,
with this woman.

1210
01:25:34,176 --> 01:25:37,202
According to the private investigator...

1211
01:25:37,612 --> 01:25:40,843
...they meet every Wednesday...

1212
01:25:41,483 --> 01:25:44,384
...at the Mayhew Hotel...

1213
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:48,182
...Room 629.

1214
01:25:49,324 --> 01:25:51,622
Room 629, huh?

1215
01:25:51,827 --> 01:25:54,421
That's the same room
his father used to have affairs in.

1216
01:25:54,629 --> 01:25:56,597
l know it well.

1217
01:25:57,732 --> 01:26:00,599
He so wants to be like him.

1218
01:26:01,736 --> 01:26:04,500
You know why
l never much cared for you?

1219
01:26:05,173 --> 01:26:07,869
Because you're such
a weak little thing.

1220
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:12,510
To be a Cartwright woman, you have
to endure a lot to enjoy these comforts.

1221
01:26:12,948 --> 01:26:15,917
You didn't mind
his father having affairs?

1222
01:26:16,251 --> 01:26:17,775
No.

1223
01:26:18,753 --> 01:26:22,450
While he was having his,
l was having a few of my own.

1224
01:26:22,691 --> 01:26:24,886
Cartwright men
are the kind of men that wander.

1225
01:26:25,093 --> 01:26:28,859
We have to be the kind of women
that stay a few steps ahead.

1226
01:26:29,064 --> 01:26:30,463
l jus....

1227
01:26:31,132 --> 01:26:32,724
l ca....

1228
01:26:33,602 --> 01:26:35,035
What?

1229
01:26:35,237 --> 01:26:38,570
Oh, you love him.

1230
01:26:38,773 --> 01:26:40,400
ls that it?

1231
01:26:41,643 --> 01:26:43,304
Yes.

1232
01:26:43,512 --> 01:26:47,414
And here l was thinking you married
him to get out of that old trailer park.

1233
01:26:48,149 --> 01:26:51,084
You-- You--

1234
01:26:51,286 --> 01:26:53,379
l don't know why l came to you
for help.

1235
01:26:53,588 --> 01:26:55,419
You don't need my help.

1236
01:26:55,624 --> 01:26:58,787
You are a woman scorned
without a prenupt.

1237
01:26:58,994 --> 01:27:01,121
That is a recipe for good living.

1238
01:27:02,063 --> 01:27:04,031
You go on home.

1239
01:27:04,499 --> 01:27:07,730
Have yourself a stiff drink,
pull yourself together...

1240
01:27:07,936 --> 01:27:10,496
...and make your demands.

1241
01:27:10,939 --> 01:27:15,103
He'll listen. You hold all the cards.

1242
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:29,122
Since you know so much
about the Cartwright men...

1243
01:27:29,591 --> 01:27:31,252
...l think you should know...

1244
01:27:31,459 --> 01:27:36,123
...your son is planning a board
meeting today to have you voted out.

1245
01:27:41,002 --> 01:27:43,596
l can't believe he hit me.

1246
01:27:44,806 --> 01:27:47,775
l have never seen Chris so upset.

1247
01:27:49,344 --> 01:27:51,608
l'm gonna press charges.

1248
01:27:53,181 --> 01:27:55,046
No, wait.

1249
01:27:56,785 --> 01:27:59,083
When did you and William...

1250
01:28:00,922 --> 01:28:03,390
...start sleeping together?

1251
01:28:04,225 --> 01:28:06,853
Mama, this is not up for discussion.

1252
01:28:07,262 --> 01:28:08,820
l'm divorcing Chris.

1253
01:28:09,497 --> 01:28:11,624
And me and William
are gonna be married.

1254
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:14,802
Oh, you are, huh? Just like that, huh?

1255
01:28:15,003 --> 01:28:16,868
Just like that.

1256
01:28:17,572 --> 01:28:21,770
This is not the '60s.
That's how it's done now.

1257
01:28:23,678 --> 01:28:24,667
Andrea.

1258
01:28:27,015 --> 01:28:30,917
You are so disrespectful.

1259
01:28:32,487 --> 01:28:36,423
Do you really think that man is gonna
leave his wife and his child for you?

1260
01:28:36,625 --> 01:28:41,028
Shut up. Shut up. Yes.

1261
01:28:42,130 --> 01:28:45,588
He will. Why is that so hard
for you to believe?

1262
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:50,237
He won't marry you.
No he won't, baby.

1263
01:28:52,073 --> 01:28:54,371
l'm sure someone told
the very same thing...

1264
01:28:54,576 --> 01:28:56,407
...to the woman
who took Daddy from you.

1265
01:28:59,014 --> 01:29:02,074
You damn near pushed him
in her arms.

1266
01:29:05,854 --> 01:29:11,793
Hey. You have no idea what happened
between me and your father.

1267
01:29:11,993 --> 01:29:16,225
-You have no idea.
-l know that he left us here.

1268
01:29:16,431 --> 01:29:21,368
He left us and he never came back
because of you.

1269
01:29:21,569 --> 01:29:24,595
He left us here struggling and broke...

1270
01:29:24,806 --> 01:29:27,639
...while he went off and remarried
and lived well.

1271
01:29:28,109 --> 01:29:30,009
Yes, he did.

1272
01:29:30,545 --> 01:29:35,039
He certainly did, but that was
30 years ago and l let it go.

1273
01:29:37,085 --> 01:29:39,645
Andrea, you have to let it go now.

1274
01:29:40,121 --> 01:29:45,218
You can not build your life
on hurts from the past.

1275
01:29:45,427 --> 01:29:49,454
William is from a different world than
you, honey, and he will not marry you.

1276
01:29:49,664 --> 01:29:53,156
He will. He loves me.

1277
01:29:53,368 --> 01:29:55,802
Where did l go wrong with you?

1278
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:02,576
You can't make yourself happy
bringing misery to other people.

1279
01:30:03,278 --> 01:30:05,838
l can see where this is going.

1280
01:30:06,047 --> 01:30:07,810
Don't do it.

1281
01:30:08,383 --> 01:30:13,150
Andrea, don't do it.

1282
01:30:14,122 --> 01:30:17,649
l raised y'all to love God
and respect other people.

1283
01:30:18,293 --> 01:30:22,821
What you're up to now
is only gonna lead to disaster for you.

1284
01:30:27,469 --> 01:30:28,959
Well...

1285
01:30:30,171 --> 01:30:33,163
...then l'm gonna enjoy the ride
on the way.

1286
01:30:43,017 --> 01:30:46,282
So here's what we're looking at.
We've got 33 floors of office space...

1287
01:30:46,488 --> 01:30:48,888
...we've got 25 floors
of condominiums.

1288
01:30:49,090 --> 01:30:53,186
And roughly between 600,000
and a half a million dollars more...

1289
01:30:53,394 --> 01:30:56,591
...you can get the gorgeous view
of Atlanta, okay?

1290
01:30:56,798 --> 01:30:59,494
And you have great schools,
the education is topnotch.

1291
01:30:59,701 --> 01:31:03,535
We have two schools down the street,
and they're just absolutely beautiful--

1292
01:31:05,373 --> 01:31:07,603
You're sleeping with my wife?
You son of a bitch!

1293
01:31:07,809 --> 01:31:10,835
-Get him off me.
-You're sleeping with my wife?

1294
01:31:11,045 --> 01:31:13,741
-Chill, man.
-Get off of me.

1295
01:31:29,964 --> 01:31:35,960
Hey, baby, you're running late.
You won't believe the day l had.

1296
01:31:36,237 --> 01:31:37,534
l went to my lawyer's and--

1297
01:31:40,875 --> 01:31:42,172
Mrs. Cartwright.

1298
01:31:42,377 --> 01:31:45,938
Yes, Mrs. Cartwright.

1299
01:31:46,548 --> 01:31:49,915
My husband won't be seeing
you again. You're pathetic.

1300
01:31:50,118 --> 01:31:52,177
That's why you're limited
to this little room.

1301
01:31:52,554 --> 01:31:54,454
He won't be seen in public with you.

1302
01:31:54,656 --> 01:31:57,056
You think his colleagues
would deal with him...

1303
01:31:57,258 --> 01:31:59,249
...if he showed up with you
on his arm?

1304
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:01,951
You stay away from my family.

1305
01:32:16,010 --> 01:32:19,104
-Oh, Mr. Cartwright, the--
-Not now, not now.

1306
01:32:27,889 --> 01:32:31,154
What the hell? l'm the only one
who has authority to call a meeting.

1307
01:32:31,359 --> 01:32:33,224
You don't say?

1308
01:32:33,428 --> 01:32:36,056
-Mother.
-Have a seat.

1309
01:32:37,599 --> 01:32:40,227
Not in your father's chair.

1310
01:32:40,902 --> 01:32:43,564
Why don't you come down here
and sit by me?

1311
01:32:48,843 --> 01:32:50,674
With pleasure.

1312
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:00,688
Well, Mother, what's this about?

1313
01:33:00,889 --> 01:33:03,653
You, darling. lt's all about you.

1314
01:33:05,059 --> 01:33:07,926
So tell me, what have you been up to
while l've been away?

1315
01:33:08,129 --> 01:33:10,927
Well, Mother,
l'm glad the board is here.

1316
01:33:11,132 --> 01:33:13,464
l've already explained to them...

1317
01:33:13,835 --> 01:33:17,498
...that several decisions that you've
made, including hiring Ms. Dexter...

1318
01:33:17,705 --> 01:33:20,003
...is not in the best interest
of this company.

1319
01:33:20,808 --> 01:33:24,869
Therefore, the board and l have voted
to retire you.

1320
01:33:25,947 --> 01:33:27,312
ls that so?

1321
01:33:27,515 --> 01:33:31,383
-lt's a unanimous decision, Mother.
-Unanimous?

1322
01:33:35,990 --> 01:33:37,355
What about my vote?

1323
01:33:37,558 --> 01:33:40,391
For some reason, you don't have
control of the share anymore.

1324
01:33:40,595 --> 01:33:42,563
And you voted against me.

1325
01:33:43,531 --> 01:33:44,555
Yes.

1326
01:33:45,934 --> 01:33:49,028
-Are you sure every member voted?
-Most of them.

1327
01:33:49,237 --> 01:33:50,864
All except the Calvary Company.

1328
01:33:51,072 --> 01:33:54,303
But they've been silent for 1 5 years,
they never vote.

1329
01:33:54,509 --> 01:33:56,477
Well, maybe it's high time they did.

1330
01:33:56,678 --> 01:33:59,511
-Are they here?
-Yes, they are.

1331
01:33:59,714 --> 01:34:03,081
-Abby, would you?
-Yes, ma'am.

1332
01:34:04,185 --> 01:34:06,153
And would the three of y'all
unanimously...

1333
01:34:06,354 --> 01:34:08,185
...scoot to the other side of the table?

1334
01:34:09,057 --> 01:34:10,581
Thank you.

1335
01:34:15,830 --> 01:34:19,095
-Sit here.
-What's going on here?

1336
01:34:23,638 --> 01:34:25,868
Mother, this is precisely why...

1337
01:34:26,074 --> 01:34:29,532
...this company thinks that you're
incompetent of running this company.

1338
01:34:29,744 --> 01:34:33,236
-What are these antics, Mother?
-My son is so bright.

1339
01:34:33,448 --> 01:34:36,645
Have you never considered
looking into the managing members...

1340
01:34:36,851 --> 01:34:38,716
...of the Calvary Company?

1341
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:40,410
Of course l have.

1342
01:34:40,621 --> 01:34:43,556
-lt's Reynolds and Blanchett.
-That is my maiden name.

1343
01:34:44,993 --> 01:34:47,689
-l'm Blanchett.
-Austin?

1344
01:34:47,895 --> 01:34:49,886
Don't you remember
your old colleague?

1345
01:34:51,899 --> 01:34:53,867
-Nicholas?
-Call me Nick.

1346
01:34:55,503 --> 01:34:58,028
-What's going on?
-Nick was one of the most powerful...

1347
01:34:58,239 --> 01:35:01,766
...stockbrokers in this company,
until your little ego let him go.

1348
01:35:02,377 --> 01:35:05,141
Apparently he's been advising Alice
for years.

1349
01:35:05,346 --> 01:35:07,712
lmagine my surprise
when l found out...

1350
01:35:07,915 --> 01:35:10,713
...she has
quite a few shares in this company.

1351
01:35:10,918 --> 01:35:13,751
-l take it this is legit, right, Austin?
-lt looks that way.

1352
01:35:14,722 --> 01:35:16,747
So, Alice?

1353
01:35:16,958 --> 01:35:19,722
l think you have been doing a fine job,
Charlotte.

1354
01:35:19,927 --> 01:35:23,124
l see no reason to change now.

1355
01:35:23,331 --> 01:35:27,097
My sentiments exactly. Well,
now that l have the controlling vote...

1356
01:35:27,301 --> 01:35:30,498
...there are a few changes
effective immediately.

1357
01:35:30,705 --> 01:35:33,469
Abby, l'd like for you
to maintain as COO.

1358
01:35:33,674 --> 01:35:36,142
And William, you're fired.

1359
01:35:37,945 --> 01:35:39,503
Meeting adjourned.

1360
01:35:41,282 --> 01:35:42,977
Mama, you're a millionaire?

1361
01:35:43,818 --> 01:35:45,615
How come you didn't say anything?

1362
01:35:46,087 --> 01:35:50,353
You never asked me.
Meeting's adjourned. Come on.

1363
01:35:57,098 --> 01:35:58,827
William.

1364
01:35:59,567 --> 01:36:01,535
William.

1365
01:36:03,104 --> 01:36:04,628
-What?
-l've been calling you.

1366
01:36:04,839 --> 01:36:07,535
-Yeah, l know.
-You know?

1367
01:36:08,443 --> 01:36:11,037
-What's going on?
-l've been fired.

1368
01:36:13,147 --> 01:36:16,048
l'm sorry. lt's okay. lt's okay.

1369
01:36:17,118 --> 01:36:21,418
We can start-- We can start
our own company together.

1370
01:36:21,923 --> 01:36:24,448
Andrea, it's over.

1371
01:36:24,659 --> 01:36:28,060
-lt's over?
-Yeah. lt's all over.

1372
01:36:28,262 --> 01:36:31,197
No, William. What do you--?
What do you mean?

1373
01:36:31,399 --> 01:36:34,163
-What are you talking about?
-l'm not leaving my wife.

1374
01:36:35,436 --> 01:36:38,234
-Got it? Excuse me.
-No. No, wait. You can't do this.

1375
01:36:38,439 --> 01:36:40,373
-Get your hands off.
-You can't.

1376
01:36:40,575 --> 01:36:45,137
William, no. You can't do this. Please.

1377
01:36:45,346 --> 01:36:48,509
What are you talking about?
We have a son.

1378
01:36:49,050 --> 01:36:51,348
-Do we?
-''Do we''?

1379
01:36:51,552 --> 01:36:54,146
-William, we have a son.
-Let go of me.

1380
01:36:54,355 --> 01:36:56,915
-William?
-Turn in your car.

1381
01:36:57,125 --> 01:36:59,559
William. William, wait.

1382
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:04,220
William, wait! Wait, wait!

1383
01:37:14,142 --> 01:37:16,042
Please.

1384
01:38:37,658 --> 01:38:39,319
Hello?

1385
01:38:41,162 --> 01:38:42,686
Yeah.

1386
01:38:46,167 --> 01:38:48,226
Jesus.

1387
01:38:52,206 --> 01:38:57,803
When Charlotte died,
it brought a lot of hurt...

1388
01:38:58,012 --> 01:39:02,142
...tears and a lot of questions.

1389
01:39:02,350 --> 01:39:05,444
l remember after my second child
was born...

1390
01:39:05,653 --> 01:39:11,785
...she asked me, ''Alice Evans, ''
as only she could say my name...

1391
01:39:11,993 --> 01:39:16,760
...she said,
''Are you living or are you existing?''

1392
01:39:16,964 --> 01:39:20,866
l didn't get what she was saying
at the time.

1393
01:39:21,068 --> 01:39:24,162
But this morning
l could hear her voice...

1394
01:39:24,372 --> 01:39:27,239
...asking me
that same question again.

1395
01:39:27,441 --> 01:39:31,002
''Are you living or are you existing?''

1396
01:39:31,212 --> 01:39:36,081
lt's funny what your mind
goes back to when you're grieving.

1397
01:39:36,717 --> 01:39:41,245
l told her after my girls were older,
l would start having more fun.

1398
01:39:41,455 --> 01:39:44,686
Then it was,
''After my children went off to college.''

1399
01:39:44,892 --> 01:39:49,158
Then it was,
''After l help with my grand baby.''

1400
01:39:49,363 --> 01:39:53,299
l would tell her,
''My children need me.''

1401
01:39:53,768 --> 01:39:57,499
But what l found
in all these years of living is...

1402
01:39:57,905 --> 01:40:03,036
...no matter how much love
and support you give your children...

1403
01:40:03,244 --> 01:40:09,945
...they are still human beings
and you are not their only influence.

1404
01:40:10,151 --> 01:40:16,989
l have spent my entire life
giving it away.

1405
01:40:17,191 --> 01:40:21,491
l think l'm gonna keep the rest of it
for me.

1406
01:40:21,696 --> 01:40:26,565
Death is a tragedy if you haven't lived.

1407
01:40:26,801 --> 01:40:31,534
Thank you, Charlotte, for your life

1408
01:40:31,739 --> 01:40:34,833
l hope you still feel small

1409
01:40:35,042 --> 01:40:38,102
When you stand beside the ocean

1410
01:40:40,581 --> 01:40:43,414
Whenever one door closes

1411
01:40:43,818 --> 01:40:46,309
l hope one more opens

1412
01:40:48,055 --> 01:40:49,454
Promise me

1413
01:40:51,525 --> 01:40:54,824
You'll give faith a fighting chance

1414
01:40:56,797 --> 01:41:00,995
And when you have the choice
To sit it out or dance

1415
01:41:03,738 --> 01:41:06,605
l hope you dance

1416
01:41:08,042 --> 01:41:10,340
l hope you dance

1417
01:43:09,530 --> 01:43:13,466
What do you say we just head north
this time?
