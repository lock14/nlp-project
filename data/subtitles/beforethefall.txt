Friedrich, time for a break !



- Friedrich, here's your day loan.
- Thank you.



Friedrich, watch where you're going !



Berlin Wedding, Late Summer 1942



- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Yes, I see that. What's up?



I had to work.



This fight is very important
for us, understand?



Is that them?



Yes.



Students from Napola,
our new elite.



They may look nerdy. But don't worry,
they aren't any different than you.



Alright, you made it. But
don't get too excited about it.



What's up, punk?
Want a punch in the mug?



You won't be any uglier
than now, anyway.



And you?



Did you say something?



I don't hear anything...



What's going on here?



Is everything okay?



Next !



Good job !



Nicely done, you'll make it.



And don't forget to cover !



Box !



Attack him !



Now ! Catch him !



And nail him !
Bring it on ! Hit him !



Hold still...



Great fight.



You fought well,
Congratulations.



Heil Hitler !



I saw your fight,
I like your style.



- What school are you from?
- None, I just graduated.



Did you hear about
the Fuhrer's schools?



Hitler's educational
outposts?



I teach Boxing and German at such a
school, at the Napola, in Allenstein.



We're currently
accepting applications.



If you report there tomorrow
morning, I may be able to help you.



What's your name?



Friedrich Weimer.



I'm Heinrich Vogler.



You've got talent, Friedrich.



Man, they're the "Elite"!



- Really?
- Sure !



They only accept the best.



-Heil Hitler, Friedrich.
-Heil Hitler.



It's good of you to come.



First we have to conduct some medical
procedures, then, it's the dexterity exam.



Understood?



Good.
Then get in queue.



Thirteen.



Ten.



Eye color?



15.



Hair color?



B.



Why did you choose this
school, youngster?



Because I want to serve the Fuhrer,
my country, and my motherland.



Nordic type,
class 1-B.



Where have you been?



- Boxing.
- At this late hour?



No, I...



I was applying to
the Napola school.



What did u say?



-You won't go there.
-But, papa...



It's a big chance for me, I
can become whomever I want...



Under no circumstance !



It's already too much, what
Hitlerjugend does to you all.



You're not going to any elite school. 



You're going to work in a factory !
End of discussion !



Why not? I'll get a secondary
school certificate there.



And you wouldn't have to pay...



Do as I say.



We've got nothing in common
with those people, understood?



Yes, father.



Why did dad get mad?



He won't let me go to that school.



What school?



A special one.



It's located in a castle,
they've got everything there,



showers, boxing hall,
not to mention the gliders.



After you graduate from
there, you become the elite,



and don't have to worry
about money anymore.



And dad doesn't want
to let you go there?



It sounds really great !



You feel dirtier leaving this,
than when you enter it.



Same difference.



You'll report first to Kindler,
then you'll start working in a month.



In one month?



So that you won't have any
time for stupid thoughts.



Well, are you happy?



I'd rather stay here.



That's so stupid.



It'll be great.



Such a kindergarten is
just like a summer camp.



You won't have to sit in a bunker all day,
and all your friends will be there too.



Hey...Is this the way for a
young German to behave?



Dear mother,
Don't be angry at me.



But I believe that this is the
chance of my lifetime. Your Friedrich.



Dear father, I forged your
signature on the permission.



If you pull me out of Napola,
I'll report all of



the bad things that you've
been saying about it.



Wake up, young man. We've
reached our destination.



Could you drop me
off right here?



Yes, sure I can.



- Thanks so much.
- You're very welcome.



But mom, I've already...



But Dad's just
butchered a pig...



No food?
Brought enough?



Stand still. Hug your
brother and smile.



What a beautiful Summer,
Mr. Von Brock.



- lndeed.
- Madam...



Friedrich.  Heil Hitler !



Good to see you. See? Your
dad finally let you come.



Not really,
but I came anyway.



Ah...
But, who signed your permission?



I did.



Well, at least you admit doing it.



A real sportsman
always tells the truth.



Well, that's exactly
what you're going to



learn here. Come,
we'll get you your uniform.



- One clothing set,
in the right size, please. - Yes, sir !



We rarely admit
people of your age,



but you caught my eye.
I hope you can appreciate it.



Ah, Schneider, come here !



This is Friedrich Weimer,
he's new here... for your room.



Show him everything and
introduce him to friends.



Yes, sir !



I'm Christoph,
welcome to Allenstein.



Thanks.



Good, I'll show you the room first, then
you can change your clothes. -Uh huh.



Hey Hubscher, now WE've
got an Aryan too !



So, this is it !



So, this is your bed,
and that's your locker.



Track suit, denim-- bottom left,
sewing kit, clothes brush-- to the left.



top right--
private things.



Your cap's not supposed to lay,
but stand, on the brown shirt.



On the bottom--
towel, handkerchiefs.



Suitcase on top,
toiletries-- on the door hook.



Ok, keep your things 'straightened', or
the orderly will throw everything out.



You'll understand the rest. Oh,
and you're going to buy dessert.



What??



Never mind.
The first time doesn't count.



Boys, the assembly
is in 15 minutes !



Good, get changed,
then, come downstairs.



Friedrich ! Friedrich !



Over here !



Have a seat.



Be seated.



Young men !



Students !



I'd like to warmly welcome you to
our school in the new year of 1942.



I'd like to inform all new students
that they have come to the place,



where their future
will be shaped.



A farmer's son and an industrialist's
one are equals in this school.



Namely, you'll be the future elite
of a one thousand year old reich.



Men may create history,



but, WE
make the men.



To my uncut diamonds, we will keep
splitting and polishing you for as long



as it takes, until a shiny,
precious jewel emerges.



And when the final victory arrives,



we will need many new
regional party leaders.



And I don't mean just
for just Cartnen



or Mecklemburg, but posts
for Washington, Moscow,



London, or even Cape Town.



Make good use of your time here.



Sharpen your body and mind.
And be faithful, loyal companions.



We would like to say 3
times, a loud Sieg Heil...



to our brave soldiers
fighting on the frontlines of



the Reich and for our
beloved leader Adolf Hitler !



Listen, guys,
this is Friedrich Weimer.



He's new to the school
and to our room.



- Hi.
- Bon Appetit.



That's our Wilhelm,
we call him Hefe.



His father is head of catering.



- and that's why this minced meat
passed inspection. - Don't listen to him.



You still didn't tell me what you
wanted in return for your notebooks.



Yeah, 300 grams
of fine liverwurst.



- 300 grams? You must be joking ?!?
- No.



But as an extra reward I'll give
you a glimpse of the photo, huh?



This is Tjaden.



He's the room champion
for the longest fart. -Hi.



The current record
is 8,5 seconds.



What's with this
whole 'photo' thing?



-Of my 3 sisters, all sweaty from dancing.
-What?



- My best source of income.
- I also trade socks for 2 marks.



- Does anybody buy this?
- You haven't met my sisters yet.



The one in the back
is Siggi...



Watch out !
Jaucher's coming !



Quick !



Friedrich, line up !



Attention !



- Is this our new recruit?
- Yes, sir.



Name??



Weimer, Friedrich.



I see, so YOU'RE the one ?!



You're quite famous,
for a new student.



Then you've got
to be pretty good.



Whose mess is this?



Move it, clean it up.



Stop sleeping !



Twenty push-ups, now !



One, two, three, four...



What's going on here?



Locker control.



Get up.



Enough.
The boy is new.



Yes, sir.



Fall out.



You've just made your first enemy.



- Christoph?
- What?



- I just wanted to ask...
-It's forbidden to talk during 'lights out'.



[ Albrecht's Nocturnal Arrival ]



Get up ! Make the beds up !
Morning gymnastics !



Faster, Friedrich.



Thanks.



Sure, no problem. I learned
this at my previous school.



-I'm Friedrich.
- Albrecht.



Can't it go any faster?



This snail's pace of yours is
really beginning to bug me...



Move it to the assembly square !



Move your asses, don't be such sand bags !



I'll teach you a lesson !



You'll see the smoke coming
out of your asses !



Get in line !



Faster !



Now on the ground !



Push-ups !



One, two !



Schulze, straight shoulders !



Kruger, lower to the ground !



Siegfried Gladen has
pissed his pants again.



Attention !



Student Gladen,
three steps forward !



Go and get your mattress.



Take off your trousers.



- What? - You're to take off
your trousers, for God's sake !



Now start peeing.



C'mon, faster !!!



As you wish...



We'll bow, lie down, and jump !



Starting from now !



One, two, three.



Keep on jumping 'til this young
man finally decides to pee.



Alright, everybody stand up !



Thank him.



Take that mattress and get the
hell out my sight ! Fucking pisser !



The one who doesn't know how
to fight in this world of immortal war



is not worth life.



Bon appetit.



Young men !



I'd like to welcome a son of a great man,
of a good and personal friend of mine,



and a party birth time companion.
With great pleasure:



Albrecht Stein,



son of our regional party
leader: Heinrich Stein.



-A very hearty welcome !
-Welcome !



Welcome Albrecht.



You're lucky, you were
given the best room.



Who's that?



That's Katharina.



- But she's already engaged in case
you wanted to know. - Who said that?



I did, you pig.



...something that Darwin
called species' evolution



can also be applied to "nation's
struggle for life" theory.



Today we'll cover the topic



"Roman writers and the Jew problem."



What means does Fuhrer...



...use to lead the party to victory?



Extermination of the weaker
guarantees survival of the stronger,



just like in the animal world.



Which Martin Luther
quotation fits here?



...and don't you even
dare to doubt...



...that, excluding the Devil,
he's the most furious



stubborn enemy of yours.



A real Jew will always be a Jew.



A modern bomber
carries 1800 bombs.



What area will he be able
to drop the bombs on



if he drops 1 bomb per second...



with the speed of 250
kilometers per hour?



What is it?



Preacher brought the names of
all the men killed on the front...



Are we here alone?



Yes.



Shall we begin?



Concentrate.



Harder !



C'mon.  More force !
Don't sleep !



Put your guard up !



You're to take him out !



Get your fists up !



Your fists up !



Move it !



You've got the strength and the skills, but
you still have to work on your technique.



Don't punch if you lack balance.



Use front hits only if you
feel you've got the advantage.



Of course, be as strong
as you can, understand?



At such moments you've got to
completely forget about being 'humane'.



This whole compassion
thing is just bullshit.



Only by doing so, will you
use your whole potential,



and be ready for bigger fights.



What big fights?



Come with me.



Here: the glory years of our boxers.



Frenz Jensen in 1937
at Napola's championships.



We were the best of all
the schools in the country.



And after that?



Well, since then, Potsdam
took over the cup.



When are the next Championships
going to take place?



In the winter.



If you train hard enough
you might take part in it.



Really?



Yes, who knows?



So, get under the shower.



Without mercy.



It's the only way he'll learn.



- Were you hit in the nose?
- Hehe, you're all sweaty !



Mail !



Hey, that's mine.



Friedrich,
a package for you.



The bathing photo !



- Yeah. - Look here, I was
supposed to get ALL of them !



You were just supposed
to have a look. Let's see.



- Want a glimpse? - Hey, why is he
allowed to look without paying?



Because you moan and
groan too much, Hefe.



Hey, you can't do that !



Just a little while...



C'mon, Christoph, please !



Dear Friedrich,
I hope that you are well.



I don't know if you know, but Dad was
visited by the Gestapo in the factory,



and now he must
work double-shifts.



Don't tell him that
I wrote to you.



Always be careful and brave.



Hans, under the circumstances
is doing well.



I miss you both very much. Looking
forward to hearing from you. Your mother.



Oh, yuck, you human pig !



Everybody, just take a deep
breath together, and it'll be over.



Yes?



Did you finish cleaning up?



- Do you head the school newspaper?
- I'm going to, starting from next issue.



Do you like to write?



Actually I do.



What do you have there?



My essays from my old school.



They've just been
sent back to me.



And?



Take a look yourself.



Give it back!



I'll put back the pages
that have fallen out.



See? there's nearly none left.



Now they're all here.



My mom always says that
everything I write is wonderful,



but she's never actually
read anything till the end.



If I were you I'd be happy.



It's like winning a battle
without having to fight.



No,



it's like being given a medal because
of their not wanting to see you fight.



Give it to me.



What do you need it for?



- I want to read it.
- You want to read a school essay?



Sure.



Are you afraid of my opinion?



No.



So?



Friedrich.



Um..would you like to
see "something" ?



- When did you discover this?
- Today.  This afternoon.



Do you really want
to take a look?



Yes, you'll help me up
and then I'll look.



Why should you be the first?



Because I found it. Besides I've
got to check if the coast is clear.



- You'll be a back guard.
-  But, I'd rather be a front guard.



Friedrich, please !



Okay, but only because
you discovered it.



And?
Do you see anything?



No, there's no one here.



Let me look.



There's nobody here.



What are you doing?



- It's MY turn.
-I've already said: there's no one there.



Doesn't matter !



And?
See anything?



Nothing. Nobody. Just like you said.



Shit !



Friedrich?



Yes?



How did you know she was there?



You held your breath for a moment.



Ready?



Ready.



Tug it!



Pull it!



Pull it, faster!



Goddamn it,
you're supposed to jump higher !



What a bunch of clumsy assholes !



Silence, let your sobbing be heard.



Follow me,



sightly virgin Freyn.



"Gods have you been
foiling, noble knight,



but I'm afraid that
dragon will you not bite."



Na,na, that is German poetry for
you, gentlemen. Carry on.



Oh! I'm sorry !



No, never apologize !
No one says: I'm sorry ! Come !



And?



Well, it's ok.



Just ok???



It is good.
REALLY good !



Remember what I said:



Fight until he's out cold.



Only one of you can win.



If you make it through 2 rounds,
you've got a chance to win.



Make him cry !



You know the rules, fight
until the knock out !



To your corners !



Box !



Stop !



Alright...box !



Hit him, Friedrich !



Believe in yourself and hit him !



You're fighting 'till the knock out !



Friedrich wins by knock
out ! Friedrich Weimer !



Congratulations, my boy,
first class fight.



Thank you.



So short with us, and so much
progress made, an excellent example.



If we take over Potsdam's
cup in the winter,



I'll put in a good word for you
at the Berlin sport school.



The next Olympics are
just around the corner.



Keep on training.



We have great faith in you.



Thank you.
Thank you very much.



What's wrong?



Nothing.



- Congratulations.
- Thanks.



You had no mercy,



he was already hanging on the ropes.



So?



He'd have done exactly
the same to me.



I've just seen him, and
he's still unconscious.



What did you expect?



- Would you rather see ME lying there?
- You didn't have to be so brutal.



- Are you maybe jealous of my victory?
- No



But couldn't you have
achieved it in a different way?



- No, I couldn't have !



Get up !



Siegfried,



where are you going so fast?



To the bathroom.



Turn around.



You're a shameful stain
on the school's honor.



What if the Fuhrer came tomorrow
and your room stunk of pee?



- What would your sport instructor
think about it?   - Please, no, I...



For 20 marks I'll forget the whole thing.



- I don't have that much money on me.
-  Then:  GET IT !



If you don't find it
before supper, your 



sport instructor will be
informed of your problem.



- Everything ok, Siegfried?
- Yeah.



A hand grenade has
an exploding range



of approximately 15 meters.



And it's splintered fragments
may fly even further.



To sum up:



Unscrew the lid,



pull the line -
and now it's triggered and sharp.



Then we make a wide sweeping motion,



we throw it, then, take cover.



After pulling the line you've got
4,5 seconds till detonation.



Are there any questions?



Fine...



Christoph, come.



So: Pull it. Sweeping motion.
Throw. Duck.



Very good.



Friedrich, next. Come.



So: Pull it. Sweeping motion.



Throw. Duck.



Wilhelm.



And: Pull it. Sweeping motion.



Throw. Duck.



Albrecht, come.



And: Pull it.
Sweeping motion.



Throw it.
I said: THROW IT !



TAKE COVER !



GODDAMMIT !



Martin. Come.



ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND ??
THROW IT !!



Our regional party leader has come



to pay a last tribute to
our hero's memory.



We are gathered here today
to pay tribute and to honor



the memory of our comrade,



Siegfried Gladen.



In a moment of terrible
and grave danger,



he sacrificed himself
for the good of others.



He gave up his own life



to save the lives of
twenty of his comrades.



The young man



who lies here now at this funeral



has filled the last seconds of
his life, not with hesitation,



but with action.



Our times don't need



timid solutions.



We don't need metrosexualists,



but men who actually do something.



Every one of us, standing
here now, should ask himself:



Why wasn't it me who
jumped on that grenade?



Did he find at that very moment,



the lives of his friends to be
more valuable than his own?



If so, why?



Our bodies are not our own property



but our nation's,



our country's



and before all, our Fuhrer's.



And what?... What can be a
better ending for our lives,



than a heroic death?



Siegfried Gladen,



our nation thanks you



and assures you that
it will never forget you.



Lower !



I can't believe my own eyes !



It can always be done
just a little bit better.



Don't let the tiredness get to you !



Enough !



Young men,



today we'll practice high jumps,



my favorite sport discipline.



It requires absolute body control,



stomach muscles must
be hard as a stiff board,



as they support the whole body.



If you bend at the waist,



you won't achieve a thing.



Hard as a stiff board.



Who wants to try first?



Come here, boxer kid.



Hard as a stiff board. Go on.



Well? Hit me.



Fine,



Line up for first the jump !



Quite a brave act.



Will you come home
with me on Sunday?



It's my father's birthday.



- Heil Hitler, master Stein.
- Heil Hitler, Johan.



Albrecht, finally.
Good to see you.



Friedrich? I've heard so
much about you. Welcome.



- Thank's for the invitation.
- No need for thanks.



- Mom, l...
- Tell me later, dear.



Come. Show me your room.



Not bad.



Yup, everything was already here...



- In the whole house?
- Yup.



Quick, quick quick !



Thank you, I'm very touched.



Happy Birthday.



Good evening, father.
Happy Birthday.



Thank you, Albrecht.



You've lost weight.
Are you playing enough sports?



Sure, of course.  Naturally.



This is Friedrich.



- You know...
- Of course.



I've heard alot about
your boxing skills.



A warm welcome.



Dear Heinrich,



on behalf of your old mates
we wish you the very best,



and a good start in Warthegau.



I hope you've got enough skills
to clean up the local mess !



Cheers !



Dear father,



I wrote a small
birthday poem for you.



Here it goes:



- At first...
- Thank you,



Albrecht, thank you very much.
I'll listen to it later.



Dear Franz,



party companions,



Thank you for this great party.



Let me tell you



that the task I was given



fills me with great pride.



I know, that it wouldn't have
been granted to me, in Berlin.



Some people simply can't
understand my methods.



But in this country, it's the Fuhrer
who decides, not the bureaucrats.



Cheers !
Carl.  Willhelm.  Franz.



How's your combat training?



- Good.  - Albrecht's going to be a
Waffen SS officer after school.



Ah, then tasks of strength
might not be all that...



So, you're the boxer, are you?



- And in perfect shape, I've heard.



- Really? Then maybe you could
show us some of your'moves'?



An excellent idea !



Gentlemen,



after dinner, I invite you to the
cellar, where our young elite



will show us something VERY special.



What a great idea.



Surprised, aren't you?



-I train in my free time to keep in shape.
-Undress !



- Undress?
- Yes, you'll show us what you've learned.



- But Albrecht does't...
- Ahhh, every German should box.



And...Box !



What's that supposed to be?



Fight honestly, you don't
have to spare anyone here.



Fight honestly,



No.



Hit me !



- No.
- You're to box !



Hit me, coward !



You're to fight !



Albrecht !



Don't you worry.
Great punch.



Genius.



Hans, give our young
people some vodlka.



Our country needs
people like you.



More people like you on the Eastern front,
and we can close that chapter for good.



Cheers !



- But, sir...
- No refusing Heinrich.



- Shall we, young master?
- Yes, let's go.



Albrecht, listen...
[  Big sigh  ]



Attention !



About face !



Young men...



Good news for you. Due
to intensified air battles



Wehrmacht has requested
some of Napola's students.



Yesterday our whole
eighth grade volunteered.



They're off to terrify the enemy !



And I'm filled with pride



that our second school certificate students



have embraced
the call, and have not



chosen to run from danger.



Heil Hitler, young men !
Heil Hitler !



Well, at least, they no
longer have to be here...



How long are you going
to stay mad at me?



I'm not mad.



I'm afraid.



Of what?



Friedrich,



Wake up.



What's going on?



It's your father.



Let's Go !
Fall in line !



Attention !



Seventh grade reporting, sir.



Heil Hitler, young men !
Heil Hitler !



At ease.



Young men, we've got a problem.



Day before yesterday, a transport
with war prisoners arrived at Allenstein.



12 Russians escaped into
the forests near Karlstadt.



They overpowered two guards,



and stole their weapons.



Nobody knows the local
area better than you do.



So I ask for your help.



If you wish to take part
in this dangerous mission,



and help recapture
these wild monsters:



Answer loudly: Yes, sir !
- Yes, sir !



Then, let's go !



Faster !



Take the ammo by yourself.



Live ammunition?



And what did you think?



That we were going to catch
them with our bare hands?  Next.



Go, go !



Get in !



Forward !



Young men. Do your best.
Don't let them escape.



I'll award the most zealous units



with a Contribution Cross myself.



Load your weapons !



Unlock them !



March off !



Halt.  Don't move !



Halt !!!



Hands up,
or I'll shoot !



I saw one there, he had
something in his hands.



Oh my god, they're just children !



Bandages ! Hand them to me ! Hurry !!



- What's he saying?
- I don't know.



It won't be any help !
Albrecht !



Everything's ok...Calm down...
Everything will be fine...



He's dead.



It's high time.



Let's go !



What's happened here?



Report.



Five captives shot while trying to escape.



- Is that the last one?
- Yes.



Stand back, Albrecht.



Father, NO !!!



Don't you DARE defy me in public again !
Understand??



- DO you understand?!!
- Yes, father.



Good job, young men.



Let's go, there's more of
them to recapture.



You too ! Get moving ! And fast !



- Sir, we...
- Why suddenly the:  "Sir"  ?



Yes, of course, I mean:  Heinrich.



Come, Albrecht.



Let's go. Move it.



- Pull yourself together !
- Pull myself together??



Do you know what
we've just done??



We didn't have to shoot !



I didn't give you an order !



But your father said
that they were armed !



What are you staring at??



I'm not looking at you.



I know what you're thinking...



Don't look at me like that !!!



- Albrecht !
- Stay here.



It won't do any good.



Hey Weimer,
were you the one who shot him?



Hey, say something.
Answer my question.



I asked you something.



Are you deaf ??



- Break it up !
- I'll take care of it.



Take their weapons.



Are you out of your minds??
This is a combat mission !



Get in.



Let's go.



You're lucky the Russians
didn't abduct you.



You'll be leaving jail tomorrow.



You, that way.



Christoph?



Shut up, Hefe.



- I'd like to talk...
- Shut the fuck up.



Attention !



Sit down !



Take out your notebooks,
you're going to write an essay:



"Winter landscape as a background
for German Knight Sagas."



You've got an hour,
starting from now.



Alright, your time's up.



Christoph, come to the
front and start reading.



Please.



German landscape as a
background for German Knight Sagas.



German landscape is a very important
background for Knight Sagas.



Oh, really, Christoph?



The earliest sources prove



the enormous role of winter
landscape in historic...



Enough. Take your seat.



Albrecht, come, you'll read.



Please.



Despite being a bit childish,



winter and a view of freshly
fallen snow awakens in us



a feeling of inexplicable joy.



Perhaps because as children, we
think of snow in relation to Christmas...



In my dreams I am the hero who
saves the virgin from the dragon.



One who frees the
world from evil.



When searching for
the escapees yesterday,



I remembered the boy who
wanted to save the world from evil.



Albrecht, enough.



Upon returning I realized
that I MYSELF am that evil...



The very evil I wanted
to free the world from.



Albrecht, enough.



Killing the captives was wrong.



- They weren't armed, as Stein had told  us,
just to bait us.     - Stop it.



- We didn't shoot men, but helpless
children.  - LEAVE THIS INSTANT !!!



[ Head of Institution ]



How can you explain
your behavior?



Do you understand the
position you've put me in?



I don't think you have the slightest
idea of all the privileges you have here.



Do you know how much I
would have sacrificed just



to be able to graduate
from such a school?



But I wasn't granted
such a chance,



by the age of 16, I'd already
been working for 3 whole years.



And you..



All you do is to trample on everything.



But that's over now.



You're going to write an essay,



in which you'll tell
the 'real' version.



And I expect you



to voluntarily join the
Waffen SS by yourself.



I've already talked
to Borner, brigade leader.



Ukraine will suit you
the best, right now.



- I can't.
- What?



I won't write a new essay.



Yesterday, I wrote
what I really thought.



I'm to be given that essay
early tomorrow morning,



or else you won't survive this.



Alright, get out. End of jail.



- What's going on?
- Haven't you heard?



Albrecht defamed his
father in an essay.



What ??



Albrecht !



What's happened?



I'll be 17 in one week.



My father's shipping me off
to the Eastern front.



I'm to write another essay
to straighten things out.



So why did you write that essay?



I couldn't have done it any other way.



What do you mean:
I couldn't...?



Yes, you couldn't neither...



when you punched the coach.



- That was something completely different.
- Oh, really?



- You didn't help anyone by doing so !
- Yes, I did.



So who'd you help? Explain it
to me. I can't understand it !



I helped myself...



Oh, really?
You helped yourself??



You didn't think about
anyone else, did you?



He ?! Say something !! He ?!



You fucking egoist !!



That's the first essay of mine
my father has ever read...



So what are you going to do now?



I don't know.



Get up ! In 10 minutes I want
to see everybody at the lake !



When I say "in 10 minutes",



then you ARE to be at the lake
in 10 minutes. Is that clear??



Okay.



You'll enter this air hole here,



then, swim (underwater)
to the second one.



Whoever's ready... goes to wash
himself, then, it's on to breakfast.



Christoph, you're the first.



Well, c'mon, it's not getting
any warmer here !



Christian and Peter,
go to the second air hole.



Ok, it's back to your room. Hup !



Friedrich, you're next. Come !



Albrecht, your turn.



Tjaden, next.



Albrecht. Albrecht !!



Albrecht, no !
NO !



Too weak...



He was simply too weak...



Obituary.



Please !



Friedrich,



good to see you up.



I'd like to have this printed
in the upcoming issue.



[ Obituary ]



No.



But,



then... they can't
yet bury him.



- You can't do that...
- Amidst people who have died for Fuhrer,



for motherland, and for the nation:
there's no place for suicides.



His parents think the same way.



They've seriously asked me



if I've forgiven you for the fact that
you're partly responsible for his death...



Both strongly feel that



their son changed greatly
since meeting you...



But I defended you.



Don't worry. I know how
much that Saturday fight,



in the name of our
school, means to you.



Strong proof of your faith



in your tutors. And your
gratitude for the chance



that you were given here.



Thank you.
You may leave now.



How are you doing?



Friedrich, what happened back
there in the forest was terrible...



And Albrecht's
death is a severe loss.



But right now, it's all about
your life..., your future...



There are scouts from various
sport schools in the audience.



Use this fact well.



Is everything alright?



Make him cry !



You know the rules.



No punches below the waist,
no head butting. Fight fairly.



Now to
your corners.



Box !



One, two,



three,



four...



Box !



Strip !
Everything.



The underwear is also ours.



Dismissed.



Hurry Weimer !
Get on with it !



Let's go, forward march !



Up until 1945, there were
over 40 Nazi educational



outposts, with more
than 15,000 students,



all within the territory
of the German Reich.



When the war was finally
acknowledged as being lost,



they were still sent out
for the:   "Last Struggle"



Blinded by instructed fanaticism and
despite being insufficiently armed,



they offered a stubborn resistance.



Half of them died...
