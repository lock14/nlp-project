Go that way. Move that way.



Back!



- Yeah?
- This is the ghost...



of Christmas past.



- Michael?
- Dad, we're stranded.



The cab broke down
on the way from J.F.K.



Are you all right?



Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.



We're on the Belt Parkway.



Where are you exactly?



Exit ten, I think.



- Exit ten?
- Yeah.



All right, stay there.
I'll take care of it.



Gre--



Shit!



What the f--



Jesus. Tony!



Yes, sir, Captain.



I told you no
flying lobster this year.



I don't need the visibility.



My secretary didn't
give me the memo.



Mikey's stuck
on the Belt Parkway, exit ten.



Pick him up.



- Jamal!
- Yes, sir.



Tommy!
Take this damn thing down!



Honey?



Justin.



Did you do this?



Do what?



Aimee's in her snowsuit.



Her what?



Mom.



Mom.



Were you planning on
taking Aimee somewhere...



in her little snowsuit?



Yeah. I'm bringing her over
to Aunt Cathy's.



Why?



Well, we've got
that court thing tonight.



You can't bring a baby to court.



You're going to the auction too.



Yes.



OK.



Does that mean I'm picking
Michael up from J.F.K.?



No. He said he was
gonna take a taxi.



All right. Thank God.
We don't want to do that.



Honey, why don't you put her
in the seat and tell Justin...



- to move his truck, will you?
- All right.



Shit.



We lost the water!



Mikey, give the door a big bang.



You got to push it off.



I got-- there you-- I got it.



Your dad's putting up
the balloon today?



Oh, no.



I got it. No.



The lobster aliens, they were
trying to send up a signal...



but the government,
they shot it down.



The lobster aliens?



Yeah. The lobster aliens.



Their mother ship
is right here...



and they're gonna take
them back home.



That's the least
of your problems.



When they get here,
they're gonna boil you alive.



Let's go take a nap.



Yeah. Go ahead.
There you go.



All right?



Watch out.



Is your phone OK?



No. Actually I think
it's completely screwed.



- Let me carry this.
- No. I got it.



No. Come on.
You're carrying too mu--



- Babe, I got it.
- Just let me car--



- I go--
- Hey, Mike?



- Yeah.
- How am I getting home?



I'll take you.



Let me just check in
with Captain Insanity first.



You don't have my purse, do y--



No.



I'm-- OK. I'm just--
it's in the van.



- I'll be right back.
- OK.



That's right. Ice them up.



They'll live at least
one more day.



Come on.



You'll have to dump them.



Hey, Mike, are you?
It's good to see you.



Good to see you.



They're all banded, right?



Yes, sir. All of them.



I got it.



Welcome home, Tiger.



Hey, Dad.



- Mikey, boy.
- What's up, fellas?



- What's up, man?
- How you doing?



Giorgio.



I lost my water this morning.
Broken pipes...



so I can't fill orders
till tomorrow.



I told you. I lost my water.



My fucking shop's
crawling with bugs.



Yeah? How's this for an idea?



How about you go shit
in your hat?



The lobsters were so excited
you were coming home...



that they all jumped right out
of the tanks this m--



It's good to see you, pal.



Good to see you, Dad.



So when's the auction?



We go to court 5:30 tonight,
but it'll be fine.



I don't want you
to worry about it.



Don't worry?



Listen. I created a bullshit
lien through Justin.



So he's in second position
on the mortgage.



Through Justin?



It's gonna be fine.
Don't worry.



Fuck!



Jamal? What the hell are you
doing down there?



He says there's lobsters
under there.



Well, use a push broom and sweep
them out, for Christ's sake.



I need your help here,
Michael, right now.



All right. I just got to
drive Kerry home.



No. I'll personally
order Miss Kerry...



Brooklyn's finest car service...



but right now,
go to the restaurant...



pick up a push broom, OK?



Aye, aye.



Yeah. Just let me
take care of it...



and I'll call you as soon
as I'm done, OK?



OK. But you still think you
can make it for dinner?



- Yeah, late dinner.
- OK.



See, you take it,
and it's got the little thing.



- You kind of pull it out.
- Why would I?



Sugar pie.



Morning, Muffin.
How are you?



Back in Lobster Land?



Just for the holidays.



How are you, Beth?



I'm doing good. Doing real good.
How are you doing?



How's your little
Internet thing doing?



Not too bad.



What's up with the sloths?



It's like a little
weed in there. Ready?



See, it goes in and--



God.



- It just squirted out.
- It's gonna d--



- Piss clam?
- Yeah.



What's your name?



Joey.



Doug.



My name's Michael Giorgio.



Here's what's gonna happen.



You're gonna change
the station to 101.1 Oldies...



because that's all we
listen to around here.



You're gonna take this,
and you're gonna...



bring it into wholesale.
Go ahead. Don't be afraid.



And then when you're both done,
you're gonna come back...



and you're gonna restock
the bay scallops...



because they're running low.



And I would imagine that
you're being paid...



to do stuff like that.



but before you do any of that,
Teen Wolf here's gonna put...



a hat on because no one wants
hair in their fish, right?



Which column?



It's under "Puppies"
near the kitten section.



Well, if they notice,
the referee could cancel...



for today, buying you a stall.



If they don't notice,
no one will be there...



to bid up the property.



Justin will be there.



Yes. Just his fake
company foreclosing.



How will the FDIC
let me foreclose...



if they're in first position?



The FDIC could try to sue you
to get the remainder...



of the balance, but--



But, but it's like trying
to get money...



out of a ham sandwich
at that point.



The prodigal son
has returned to us.



Jesus. You guys unloaded
the whole house in here.



Yeah. We did.



There's a lot of shit
at my place, too.



We kept some of your stuff.



Who bought the house anyway?



A very nice, happy couple
with lots of money.



What's up with Dad's
office dorm room? Cozy.



Michael, he has truly lost it.



So what, are they-- what,
are they, like, separating?



He doesn't want to look
for a new place.



He's up here.
She's staying at my place.



I guess you could call that
a separation.



Lauren, could you bring down
the Jade Mumbo tickets?



Michael will bring them down
in a minute, Daddy.



No. You tell Michael to get his
ass down here right now.



- Help you with something?
- I'm Mrs. Giorgio.



Mike's around here somewhere.



- Mom.
- Oh, Mikey.



- Hi.
- How are you?



I'm good. How was your trip?



- Horrible.
- Yeah?



Yeah. Red eye. Middle seat.



You know, crying baby,
the whole bit.



It sounds great.



How's my Kerry?



She's good.



- Good.
- How are you?



Well, I thought the cheese was
slipping off my cracker...



for a while, but I'm good.



I'm moving forward.



You really getting
your own place?



- I am.
- Really?



Yeah. I think it's time.



I think Justin and Lauren
need their own space.



Guess you wouldn't
want to live upstairs?



Dad's living like an animal.



Well, as long as he's
comfortable living...



with his sea creatures,
I'm happy for him.



I just don't want to do
this anymore.



- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, honey.



- How are you?
- I'm fine.



Good.



- Here he comes.
- Dad.



Good evening, your honor.



This guy the judge?



Former judge, now a referee.



Are parties representing
Block 14, Lot 31...



D.B.A. Giorgio's
Lobster Farm present?



Your honor, we need
to postpone this auction...



due to lack of notice posted...



by the foreclosing second
mortgagee, Justin Wallace, Inc.



Is a member
of Justin Wallace, Inc. here?



Yes, your honor.
I'm Justin Wallace... Inc.



Your honor, I believe notice was
posted in the city paper...



as required by this auction.



You will see, your honor,
that he posted notice...



in the Pet Adoption section
of the paper.



It's a lobster farm?



I thought it was fitting.



Your honor, I believe that
the second mortgagee...



and Mr. Giorgio are connected.



Connected?



Know each other.



Is there a law against
knowing the person...



initiating the foreclosure?



Mr. Giorgio, I can understand
your wanting to keep...



this auction a secret.



Notice was posted.



And now he will
post notice properly.



Your honor, can we have
a little more time...



to see if we can work out
a refinancing with the FDIC?



Ample time has been given.



Bullshit. They just want
to tidy up their books...



before the new year.



Sorry, your honor.
Mr. Giorgio's upset.



His livelihood's at stake here.



There are circumstances.



What circumstances?



The FDIC took over
Capital Trust...



Mr. Giorgio's bank.



They foreclosed on all
the small business loans.



They sent a letter that
basically said, "Pay or die."



My bank goes under...



and the FDIC puts
a gun to my head.



- That's not true.
- You bet your ass it's true!



Mr. Giorgio.



Would you mind if
I come closer, your honor?



Please, come forward.



There's just one more thing.



This property has been
in my family's name...



for over sixty years.



My family catered to this entire
community for over sixty years.



Now I'm willing to fulfill
my obligation.



All I'm asking is that the FDIC
reconsider their position.



After all,
the bank defaulted, not me.



Mr. Giorgio, I can
understand your sentiment.



However, you cannot appeal
your foreclosure here.



The new auction date is set
for Friday, December 18.



That is all.



Thank you, your honor.



Don't mess with my system,
Lauren, dear.



OK. Throwing dirty clothes
in your hamper's...



messing with your system?



First, make sure they're dirty.



You want to check?



Dad, how long do you plan on
camping out up here?



I have my little shower,
my beddy-by...



my socks and undies table.
I'm all set.



This place is a pigsty.



I told you, you're welcome
to come up here...



and depigify the place.



And I told you I am not going to
share my home with dead fish.



What do you smell?



Seriously.



Foot powder.



Foot powder.



Cape Cod-style home in Brooklyn.



People would die
to live up here.



A beautiful balcony
overlooking a marina?



I could make
the main office a den.



We got to get going, Lauren.
Got to pick up Aimee.



You're right. We do.



Justin, did you-- do you want to?



Yeah. If it would be all right
with you, Frank...



I'd like to bring
that franchise guy by tomorrow.



Thank you, Justin,
but I'd rather not.



You can at least talk to him.



I don't want to turn
my restaurant...



into a burger joint.



A McDonald's, Dad.



Burger King, Wendy's, Taco Bell.



I'll be in the car.



Thank you, Dad.



I really appreciate that.



Please don't start.



He took a risk for you today.



At least you could hear him out.



You still looking for a place?



I'm taking a place
around the corner from Lauren.



You sure didn't waste any time.



What, are you kidding?



Well, how long you been looking?
Two weeks?



What does it matter?



You're very happy up
in your little clubhouse alone.



Come on, come on, Maureen.
Are you serious about this?



I'm buying it.



How're you even going to
pay for it?



My sister's gonna help me.



Your sister?



Fine, great.



Congratulations.



Thank you.



Okey-dokey.



You OK?



Yeah.



- Can we go?
- Yeah.



OK. You want to tell me
what's on your mind?



Well, I...



I just thought you were
going to ask Kerry soon.



I'm thinking about it.



Well, it's Christmas,
and it's such...



a beautiful time to ask
somebody to marry them.



- I don't have the ring yet.
- But you're looking.



I don't have it yet,
but as soon as I get it...



you'll be the first
to know, I swear.



I'm begging you,
please start the car.



I forgot how we easy
you are to read.



Jesus.



Especially when you're
hiding something.



I'm not hiding anything.



Can I see it?



I'm just teasing, Mikey.



It's in the front pocket
of the laptop case.



I knew it.
I could smell it!



I'll get it.



What's the matter?



What?



Nothing.



You hate it?



No.



- You hate it.
- I li-- no. I like it.



Just say you hate it.



The ring's not that important.



Well, it doesn't matter.
It was done.



Forget about it.
So just forget it.



You're not gonna ask her now?



No.



Not with the Fisher-Price
shit ring your son bought.



You know, your grandmother
had a beautiful ring.



Really? Well, maybe
we can exhume her.



I'm not digging up my mother.



I was kidding.



I think I might have it.



Not that you couldn't use yours.



Your c-- Mom,
I want to go, please.



Turn the car on.



- Michael.
- Hello, Mr. Miller.



Come in.



Thank you.



What have you got there?



Lobster, shrimp.



Lobster, shrimp?



- Yeah.
- That sounds delicious.



- Thank you.
- You're welcome.



Here you go.



- It's leaking a little there.
- I'm sorry.



That's OK.
I can handle that.



Hey, Lynn?
Lynn, I need a sponge.



- Hi, babe.
- Hi.



What happened at court?



Postponed.



Is that good?



Well, it's good for now.



I hope you're hungry.



Oh, God.



Yes, I know. Yes.



I always thought you were
kidding when you said...



you didn't eat seafood.



Are you the only one?



No. Nobody in my family
eats seafood.



Your family must know
something we don't know.



Where did your folks move to?



They're looking for a place.



Where are they now?



My sister's in Brooklyn.



They had to sell the house?



Your mom must be heartbroken.



She's all right.



Change is good.



Transitions can be fun.
It's true.



Is it just a money thing?



Dad.



The foreclosure was
on your dad's business, right?



The bank defaulted on the loan.



Maybe my brother could help.



Yeah?



He's an M&A attorney.



Really? M&A?



Yeah. He's right over
in Garden City.



Lynn works there now.



That's a very good idea.



I could talk to him
about it tomorrow.



I'll talk to him, Lynn.



Well, what could he do?



Chuck could set your dad up
with some money guys...



some real Wall Street
heavy hitters.



How do you mean?



Well, they could buy
the note from the bank...



and then set up a refinance with
your father.



Well, I'll talk
to my dad about it.



You know, Chuck's having
a holiday party tomorrow night.



Why don't you stop by
for a cocktail?



Yeah. I'll try to make it.



Chuck's very nice.



He set up Kerry
with some job interviews...



after the holidays.



After the holidays.



In New York?



It's nothing definite.



If you want to stay
a little later, too...



you're welcome to stay
in our basement.



We refinished it.



Thank you.



I was going to talk to you
about moving back first.



Really?



I just want to know
what's going on in your head.



You want to move back here?



For good?



I want us to move back.



It's Tony.



Hey, Tony.



Do you think it would be
sacrilegious to have Santa...



be one of the wise guys?



'Cause I cannot find
the third guy.



No. He was a saint...



So I think you'll be
all right with that.



Saint.



They're all a bunch
of plastic freeloaders anyway.



All right, Tony.



This property is
in the ass-end of Brooklyn.



Nobody's gonna put up
800,000, 900,000 for it.



Someone would just have to put
up thirty percent though.



You got 300,000
on you, tough guy?



No.



Plus I got my shit card.
There's no sewer down here.



Only a cesspool, thank Christ.



Can you do me a favor?



- What's that?
- Talk to your mother.



See if she's serious
about getting her own place.



I think she already did.



What a bullshit, hasty decision.



I don't think so.



You don't?



No. She's cramped at Lauren's,
and you don't want...



to look for a place.



Well, Christ. I just want
to put out this fire first!



There's always a fire, Dad.



Honey, I love the kissing post.



I don't know if you love
the kissing post.



Because if you're not gonna use
the kissing post...



then the kissing post
is gonna be gone.



It's a one year--



It can't go away.



Kissing post.
I am the kissing post.



Kissing post.



Oh, my God.



Do you guys need anything
at the store?



No.



Great. OK. Bye.



Thank you.



Mom, I just want to say...



I do not want you to be
embarrassed at all.



I mean, Justin and I--



Honey, I'm not embarrassed.
It's OK.



OK. I just-- I don't want you
to feel like you're intruding...



or anything like that.



I know that,
and you two have been terrific.



It's just this situation
is ridiculous.



I'm too young to be
a burden already.



Mom, you're so not a burden,
and you know that.



Lauren, the old granny
living with her daughter.



- All I want...
- Ma.



Is my own life
and my own place...



and I want to put all
of my things together...



and that's all I want.



That's it.



And you're gonna do it alone...



without Dad?



I don't know if it's I'm not
wanting to understand that, Mom.



I'm just-- I'm trying to--



Honey, I have been alone
throughout this entire marriage.



Now I dearly love your father...



but since you and Michael left,
we have nothing to talk about...



except the claws.



There's not that much to say
about crustaceans.



A couple of things.



I'm fine.



I'll say you are.



I love you, sweetie.



Mom. I love you, Mommy.



You're gonna come back,
aren't you?



- I'll come back.
- All right.



I mean, you'll come back
tonight, too.



I'm definitely
coming back tonight.



- Well, everything, yeah.
- My things are here.



Yeah. OK.



It's like we're camping again.



We never went camping.



Right.



How's Miss Kerry?



She's OK.



She wants to move back.



Yeah, it's hard to take
a girl away...



from her friends and family.



You're at work, she's at home...



with just the birds
and the trees.



Dad, she had a job.
She was working, too.



No shit.



Good for her.



I always knew she was
a smart little cookie.



What was she doing?



Some bullshit position
at the "Seattle Times."



"Seattle Times."



There's a lot more
opportunities in New York.



Yeah, I'm sure you can do your
dotcom think in New York, too.



Don't you mean dotclam?



I'm only saying you don't have
to come back here full-time.



Well, maybe just a year.



I'll stay off your ass
this time.



I swear.



A year's a long time, Dad.



Maybe not a year then.



Just a little while.



Like, six months a little while,
two weeks a little while?



I don't know.



A little while.



All right.
I'll think about it.



Yeah, probably six months
a little while.



Night, Dad.



Good morning everybody.
It's your Cousin Brucie...



and right now, I'm gonna wake
you up and keep you...



moving and grooving
with some doo-wop...



straight from my home borough,
the borough of Brooklyn.



Frank.



Red says he's not got
no more bakala.



Fuck Red. Go to Franco.



OK.



Billy, I'll see you over
at the Pearl.



Got it.



For Maureen from Jen.



It's not
a sump pump motor, is it?



The salt water's not back on?



Not yet.
Billy, I wanted to ask you.



That crazy bastard who sold used
machine parts in Chinatown.



I'm talking about ten years ago.



Yeah. Jimmy Chen.



He's long gone now.



Dead maybe.



Shit.



- Everything all right?
- Yeah. Everything's fine. Yeah.



The legal thing.



Yeah, it'll work itself out.



It's gonna be fine.



Wow. Check that out.



Baby.



Beautiful.



Check the wheels
on that son of a bitch.



It's got, like,
two-inch treads on it.



Hey, where'd you get
that hand truck?



No. Where'd you get your
mano coachy?



Mano coachy?



Mano coachy.



Your huevos ranchos
has arrived, Senor Lau.



Muchos gracias, amigo.



Lauren? Lauren, hold on.



Here. Give this to Michael.



- What the heck is this?
- It's Grandma's ring.



- And?
- I'll explain later.



- You guys got to band them up.
- Put the cuffs on them.



What do you mean,
put the cuffs on them?



Timo, show him what to do.



Hey, Michael.
Can I talk to you a minute?



How're you doing?



- I'm all right.
- Yeah?



What's up, Tom?



The shit's really hitting
the fan with the old man, no?



Sort of, yeah.



Well, I got something, you know,
that can really pull him out...



of the mud, you know...



maybe give him
a nice blast of cash.



- Yeah?
- Yeah.



Can you meet me after work?



- Yeah, sure, I'll try.
- Mikey, do that, OK?



It's kind of time sensitive,
all right?



- All right, man.
- See you later.



All right, Tom.



Morning, Frank.



Hi, Beth.



Starting to sleep.



I know. This lulls her.



What's the matter?
You still mad?



Yes, I am.



Look, it's not that
I don't appreciate...



what Justin was trying to do.



Dad, you didn't let him finish.



He wasn't saying to keep it
a McDonald's forever.



I mean, he was trying to explain
that you could use...



the franchise for five years to
get yourself out of the mud...



and then you can make your
Lundy's Seafood Palace...



the one you've always
wanted, you know?



Once you're clear.



You think the guy putting up
the dough for the franchise...



is gonna agree
to a five-year lease?



You can bet your ass he won't.



No. I got to do this
the way I want to do it, OK?



Well, sure, Dad.
Your way's always the best.



All right. Could you watch
Aimee for a few minutes, Beth?



Lauren, come on.
For Christ's sake.



Those kids did the writing thing
again on the lighthouse.



Tommy, after this, clean it off.



How's it going, Tony?



Well, we found the sewage pipe.



Which one's the sewage pipe?



The white one.



But the break in the salt water
pipe could be anywhere.



Could be from here to the store.



There's not much more time.



What, how long have the lobster
aliens been deprived of oxygen?



They've been out
of the water a long time.



They're gonna start dying.



I think we have to dump them.



Right. let's dump the crates
in the harbor.



You're gonna dump
boxes of cash...



and float them
on the water?



We have no choice.



Tommy, don't forget
the lighthouse.



Jamal, you have to start
packing crates.



We need to transfer them.



Come on!



Come on, Tommy.



Michael, tuck them in
and make them comfortable.



That a way.
Good job, fellas. Good job.



Wasn't perfect,
but we got them in.



Christ. When I started
with my dad...



we had to hump the crates down
here every other week.



Used shitty tanks?



Tanks? It's more like
jerry-rigged bathtubs.



Your grandfather was
a great businessman...



but not exactly an engineer.



He thought he had
it covered once.



You know, he went out
to the bowery...



and he bought five
old Coca-Cola machines...



the kind that had
cold water swirling in it?



You know, he'd wake me up
at 5 a.m.



We'd come down right here...



and we'd get a couple
of garbage pails...



and fill it up with salt water.



We'd dump the water
into the Coca-Cola machine.



We put in about fifty lobsters.



Twenty-four hours later,
every lobster dropped dead.



It fucking drove him crazy.



He couldn't figure out why all
the lobsters were dying.



Why were they dying?



Well, there was copper tubing
and it reacted...



to the salt water...



poisoned all
the little bastards.



Every morning,
fifty dead lobsters.



God.



His face was priceless.



To look down and see
that they died again?



Fucking priceless.



All right.
Let's fill Bill's order.



Chinatown, baby.



We're gonna be
in this forever.



Michael, Mikey, you're gonna
have to hand truck it down.



Oh, come on.
He needs it right now?



He needs it right now.
What, you want me to do it?



- No.
- Well, go ahead.



I'll meet you in front,
all right?



We're gonna-- I'm gonna be
here forever anyway.



- All right, all right.
- Jesus Christ!



Uncle Billy.



Hey. How're you doing?



Michael!



Should I come back?



No. Come in.
It's so good to see you.



- Good to see you. Hey.
- Hi.



It's good to see-- so grownup.



How's your mom?



She's doing well. Thanks.
How are you?



I'm fine.



- Mindy is driving me crazy.
- Mom!



Ever since she turned sixteen,
she's complete nightmare.



You know what?
My sister was worse.



- Really?
- She is worse.



You're kidding.



I don't know if it could
get any worse.



What's with Hurricane Mindy?



Really?



All right.
Let's get the boxes.



OK. Bye, Jen.



Bye.



- Holy Jesus, Bill.
- What?



What the hell you
keep down here?



It smells awful.



What smell are you
talking about? Come on.



Bill, you know what?



You spend too much time
down here is the problem.



What is that?



It's shark fin.



- Shark fin?
- Yeah. Look.



You cut them like this.



People eat that?



They usually go nuts
for the fin.



Usually for soup.



That's gross.



Come on.



Give this to your father.



Tell him to go into the shark
fin business with me...



no more problems.



Yeah.



What, are you serious?



- I love your father.
- I know.



Your dad is my
most favorite lo fon.



- Lo what?
- Lo fon.



- Low fat?
- Non-Chinese person?



A lot of lobsters
crawling all over...



but you'll love it.



And there he is, talking to my
least favorite Chinese person.



- You remember my brother Ron?
- Hey, Ron.



You better cut
your brother some slack.



I think his cellphones are
outselling your halibut.



Maybe I'll just go
to the Bahamas...



and you let you
oon-gots run things.



- Oon-gots?
- Oon-what?



- Oon-gots?
- Oon-who?



Hey, you guys need
a new phone or what?



- Actually, I do.
- Pick one, Mike.



I'll put this in the pickup.
Bye-bye, Bill.



- Hey, what about you?
- No, thank you.



I'll stick with my old one.



Well, it's about time.



Dad.



What the hell is that?



Shark fin.



Shark fin?



Yeah. I think Uncle Bill
wants you to go...



into the shark fin
business with him.



A shark fin on rye
with extra sour pickle?



That's fucking delicious.



Dad, I'm serious.



I think he wants
to help you out.



Just...



It's gonna be fine.



OK. Maybe if we...



enough, no one
will show up to your auction.



- Shut up and eat your fin.
- I don't want it.



What, she cried herself
to sleep?



No. I got her to sleep.



Where you going
all dressed up anyway?



I'm going to a show with Justin.



Aren't you overdressed
for the Dave Matthews Band?



I'm going to a Broadway show.
Thank you.



Where are you off to?
I'm going to meet Kerry.



That reminds me. OK.



Listen. I don't think
you're ready...



but I think it's nicer
than the one you got.



You haven't seen the one I got.



No, but Mom described it
on the phone to me.



You guys suck.



You taking her
somewhere special tonight?



Yeah, special. We're going to
her uncle's house for cocktails.



Well, you can go
for one cocktail...



but Dad's taking Aimee,
so you're going to have to...



come back here
and close out tonight.



No. I'm going because
Kerry's uncle knows...



some money guys for Dad.



I understand that.
Listen, Michael.



This is my one free night
to do something special...



with my husband.



You're here for one week.



You can't close out for me once?



- Lauren, please.
- Michael, listen to me.



I am gonna go
to the show tonight.



Dad's gonna drive
Aimee to Mom's...



and you are gonna close out!



Aimee? How's Papa do this?



I'm gonna put the seatbelt on.



Oh, no, Aimee, baby.



Papa loves you.



Papa will be right back, OK?
Papa come back.



I'll be right back.
Wait for me, OK?



Wait. Fine.



Look what Papa's got.



We're going for a ride,
little sweetheart.



Yes. We're going for a ride.



Let's go bye-bye.



OK.



We'll go see Nana.



I love you.



This is good, man.
Where'd you get this?



- Yo.
- Mikey, boy.



- Jamal.
- What's happening, man?



What are you doing, man?



Jesus. Come on.



I got to drive
this thing tonight.



I'm sorry, Mikey.
Tommy smoked me out, man.



Tommy smoked you out?



What the hell is
that all about?



Go to retail. Get some Lysol,
all right, or something.



All right?



- Come on, talk shop, Mikey.
- All right.



I'll only be one minute,
all right?



How are you?



I was gonna ask
your father about this...



but I figured it'd
be better to ask you.



What is that, Tommy?



What do you think?
It's lobster bread, Mike.



Yeah, I guess it is.



Hey, my cousin's, like, the head
baker at Astarito's now.



The guy is amazing.



He can make bread look like
fucking anything, man.



Squirrels, puppies, cats,
fuckin' anything.



- That's great.
- Yeah.



Tommy, I'm freezing.
Can we go, please?



Honey, just give me
two minutes, huh?



You got one.



So I figure, you know, we can
start moving these...



through your pop's store,
you know.



I think your old man can
make some serious scratch...



off of these.



All right.
I'll talk to him about it.



- You'll talk to him, Mikey?
- Yeah.



I'm just trying
to help, you know.



I know, Tom.
I-- that's-- I'm speechless.



- Ain't their eyes great, man?
- What i--



Yeah, they're raisins, I think.



- Raisins.
- I'm telling you. He's amazing.



Tommy, that's it.



- Thanks, man.
- I'm coming, baby.



She's gonna be the death of me,
man, I'm telling you.



Here I am, baby. Here I am.



Honey, you've had too much wine.



Oh, Michael, sweetie.



Merry Christmas.



- Welcome to my house.
- You know Fran.



Hello.



Mom, we're gonna find Chuck.



OK, sweetie.



Merry Christmas.



Come on. Don't leave.
You're my favorite.



It's too early. Come on.
Get the hell out of here.



I'm finished with you.



- Chuck.
- Hey. Hi.



Hi. You know Michael.



Yeah. Lobster Boy.



- How the hell are you?
- How are you? Good.



I don't know.
You're empty-handed.



Where's my lobster?



I told him you brought my dad
some lobster and shrimp.



No. I don't want shrimp.
I want a big fucking lobster.



Maybe next time.



No. I'm kidding.



So, I talked to Jimmy...



And he says you want to talk
some shop, a little business?



Let's go out of the noise.



All right.



They didn't redecorate yet?



No.



Jeez. It still looks like
the way your mother had it.



Yeah.



Look. Has Jerry Garcia got
any real booze in here?



Canadian Club.



Perfect.



One for me and one
for Miss Aimee.



Come here, baby.
Sit with Papa.



You know, Frank,
maybe you should just...



Mama.



Come on, Aimee, sweet girl.



Come on.
I'll bring you upstairs.



Yes, I will.



Come on, love.



Very nice.



You like cigars?



No, not really.



I smoke cigarettes
every now and then.



You should switch.
Cigars are really good.



- Yeah?
- Yeah.



Mouth cancer, lung cancer,
same thing, right?



So your your dad's up
against the wall, huh?



Yeah. The bank he got
the loan from went belly-up.



He get the full loan out?



No. And the FDIC's calling
the loan, leaving him...



with a half-finished
restaurant, so.



Jesus.



Yeah.



Well, he, he's gonna foreclose
on himself and bid...



on the property
through my brother-in-law.



Chuck, your mother's leaving.



I'll be right in.



- What are you doing out there?
- I'll be right in.



So basically,
what you're asking...



is for a private refinancing.



Yeah, I guess.



Your dad's shop open tomorrow?



Yeah.



I think I know
the right guy for this.



Oh, thank you.



Yeah, I don't mean to rush you,
but just so you know...



we're down to the wire on this.



So maybe we'll stop by tomorrow,
have a little lunch...



check out the property...



Thank you. That'd be great.



And you better have
that fucking lobster.



Yeah. That's one thing
we got a lot of.



Oh, boy. It's getting
cold out there...



and it's gonna get colder.
so, cousins, make sure...



you get all that Christmas
shopping done quickly.



Not too long
before the big day is here.



Dave, Bill, how they biting?



Not too good.



Good morning, Bear.



Good morning, Bear.
I love you, baby.



What a shot.
I should have hair like that.



Ipan? Ipan, I'm here.



Where's Ipan?



Ipan.



Where the hell's Ipan?



Ipan went back home.



Ipan went back home?



Yeah, his wife wanted him there.



Can I help you?



- What's your name?
- I am Salim.



Salim, I'm gonna teach you
how to make my coffee, OK?



All right. Now you got
the hot chocolate powder...



- in the cup.
- Yes.



Good. All right.



No. Not the hot water. Coffee.



- Coffee?
- Yes.



Pour the coffee
on top of the powder.



Good.



Hot chocolate coffee.



It's good?



It's as if Ipan never left.



Thank you.



This paper's all mangled.



I'm gonna pay you
only fifteen cents.



What are you talking
about, Frank?



This is cute.



Yeah, I like that one. 12.99.



Wow.



I miss you guys.



We miss you, too.



Good lord. This stinks.



What stinks?



My sweaters.



It's not that bad.
It just needs to air out.



How long were these
in the lobster van?



They were wrapped
in plastic, Mom.



Am I wrong, Kerry?



Yeah, I have to agree.
It's pretty bad.



OK, well, that's that.



Fuck! Shit, goddamn it,
Jesus Christ!



At least he's still
got his faith.



Beth, can I get a clean apron?



- Your dad is pissed.
- Why? What's the matter?



Some guys you told to come look
at the place are here.



Come on. How good is this?



A little spicy, but it's good.



Wait a minute.
You told me you liked spicy.



I do like it.
I do like it spicy.



Really good.
Get the recipe.



There's that meshugana now.



Mikey? Where is he?



There he is.



How are you?
Good to see you again.



So you met my son David
the other night, right?



No, but I keep hearing
about him.



How're you doing? This seafood
is pretty damn good.



- And that's John Evans.
- How are you?



Yeah, how are you?
Nice to meet you.



- Ritchie Thompson over here.
- How are you?



Hey, enjoy your steamed
extraterrestrials, gentlemen.



That's funny.



So you talk to my father yet?



He said you're gonna give
us the tour.



Don't tell me what you heard.



I know what I said,
and don't te--



Tommy! Jamal!



You got to repack Mumbo.



All halves, nothing over.



I need it yesterday.
Let's go.



So this really isn't
a lobster farm.



I mean, you don't raise
them here, right?



No. We buy them in bulk...



and then we keep them
in the tanks and in the wells.



- Wells?
- Yeah.



What do you mean wells?



- Will you give me a second?
- Sure. Yeah.



Dad, I'm sorry.



Not good, Michael. Not good.



I don't know these guys from
a fucking hole in the wall...



and now they're asking to go
through my books?



Dad, this could be a good thing.



Yeah. You want to show
them around, go ahead.



Look. I know you're pissed...



but please give them
ten minutes. Please.



This is my daughter Lauren.



- Hello.
- The wizard behind the curtain.



My granddaughter, Aimee,
now sleeping.



No computers?



Well, Lauren is not only
the best clam shucker...



in Brooklyn but also my
very own personal computer.



You're in computers,
right, Michael?



Yeah. They like their system.



Cash business.
Only way to go.



Screw Uncle Sam.



Uncle Sam still gets his share.



Is there a water view?



You said something
about a marina.



I always wanted a bed
in my office.



It's an office slash
storage facility...



at the moment.



How many square feet
is the upstairs?



3,000.



Retail and wholesale,
about 7,000.



Well, it's a fantastic
piece of property.



I bet you got it
for a song, huh?



My father bought the plot
in the thirties...



so you can imagine.



Look. I got to get
back downstairs.



The auction's tomorrow, yes?



Federal court in Brooklyn?



Yeah. But that may be postponed.



Oh, really? OK.



Michael will finish up your
little tour, OK?



- Pleasure to meet you.
- Yeah.



Jamal, get me another box, huh?



- Tommy.
- Yeah?



Get me another
lumber crayon from the booth.



Dad, I know you might
want to talk about it.



Please.



Dad, you want to talk
about this?



There's nothing to talk about.



Thanks.



Dad, I didn't know they were
gonna just drop in like that...



but look, these guys have money.



And I've got my underwear
on the fucking table literally.



You know how dumb
this was, do you?



See, I knew you wouldn't
give it a chance...



so I wanted to give it a chance.



Even if you have
good intentions, Michael...



you can't be going
behind my back.



Michael, it's too fragile
of a situation...



just to be having strangers walk
on in here.



These guys stormed
my place unannounced.



They know about the auction.



They know about
my fucking weaknesses.



It was a dumb fucking move!



Oh, are you all done, miss?



I am, thank you.



I'm gonna keep my coffee.



All right. I'll have
the girl come right over...



to take care of you.



- Hi.
- Hi.



- May I help you?
- Yeah.



I was wondering how much
a room was for the night?



$65 per night.



$65 per night?
Per room, per night?



Of course.
$65 per whole night.



Whole night.



What do you think?



I think that's great.



I'll have-- I'll take a room
for, well, for a night.



- Hello?
- Hi, Ms. Miller.



- Is Kerry in?
- Oh, no, Michael.



She went up to Connecticut
to see her grandparents.



Oh, that's right.
I forgot.



Do you want the number
up there, Mike?



No. That's OK.
I'll call her tomorrow.



Well, I'll have her call you
if she checks in.



Well, actually I'm staying
at the Provida Motel...



in Brighton Beach.



Provida Motel.
OK. Good night, Michael.



Night.



He shoots.



He doesn't score.



It's not your fault.



I forgive you.



He's always late.



Family court.



Oh, Jesus.



Who's that?



It's Kerry's cousin.



I think so.



Can I help you with something?



Yeah, hey, man.
How're you doing?



- Michael, right?
- Yeah.



Can I ask you
what you're doing here?



Yeah, just came to
check out the process.



Just came to check
out the process.



Yeah. It's pretty wild, huh?



Correct me if I'm wrong.
It's kind of like...



an auto auction, isn't it?



Not really.



Hey, there's no worries, man.
We're not here to bid.



I'm just here
for my own edification.



- Excuse me.
- Sorry.



Your own edification.



Well, that's good, because
I don't think it'd be...



a good idea to bid.



Yeah, we're not gonna.



We might stick around
for a little while though...



if that's OK.



- Yeah, go ahead.
- Thanks. Good to see you.



Don't worry about it.



Parties representing
Block 14, Lot 31...



D.B.A. Giorgio's
Lobster Farm present?



Yes, we are, your honor.



Parties representing the FDIC?



I'm sorry, your honor,
but as you see...



we're pretty much
all alone here.



Once again, we must postpone
due to lack of notice.



You posted this?



Yes, your honor. I believe
I posted the D.B.A...



and actual address.



It's a four point font,
your honor.



Font?



It's the size of the print face.



It's so small,
you can't read it.



We have to set
another auction date.



We're not setting another date.



The notice is
in the right section.



Mr. Giorgio.



And you didn't specify
font sizes.



Your honor?



Mr. Giorgio,
please control yourself.



Mr. Giorgio is correct.



There was no
minimum print size specified.



Thank you.



Don't thank me.



That was your last charade.



I'm resetting a final
auction date for December 22.



The FDIC will now post notice
however they see fit.



That is all.



Thank you, your honor.



Mikey.



He was just trying to help.



It sure did backfire.



I don't know.
Maybe it's for the best.



What's for the best?



What's for the best?



Nothing.



Four more days.



Four more till I go
on the auction block again.



You want me to call my sister?



Your sister?



To help with the money.



No. No, thanks.



I'll figure something out.



I forgot. You've got those
magical elves...



to lend you a hand.



- That's funny.
- Yeah, well.



Hey, Frank, what happened?
You closing early or what?



No. I'm opening late.



Merry Christmas, you.



Merry Christmas.
How are you?



I'm good. Oh, I've got
a present for Jen.



You got her a present,
you didn't get me a present?



You can have Frank.



A crusty old Italian!
Wow! thanks, Santa.



Good night, guys.



Michael, I'm taking the drawer.



All right.



Mr. Giorgio?



I think you're aware
that your son stopped...



by my little auction today.



Did he?



Let's cut the bullshit,
all right?



Let's cut the fuckin' bullshit.



All right.



Your son's name?



Dave. David.



You're gonna call
your son David...



and you're gonna tell your son
David, to back the fuck off...



from my auction.
Are we clear?



Mr. Giorgio, my son
is his own man.



Your son is not a man.



Your son is
a greedy, little shit.



Now that was not
really necessary.



Tell me you're
not gonna call your son.



Tell me you're not gonna
call your son...



so I can do what I have to do.



And what would that be?



I will rip out
your fuckin' lungs.



Do you hear me?
Do you fuckin' hear me?



Yeah, yeah, I hear you.



Hey, you're home.



I can't believe you.



What?



What's the matter?



You don't know?



You don't know
what your father did?



Hi, Michael.



Hi, Ms. Miller.



It's OK, Mom.



Your dad's pissed, I understand.



Babe, my dad is in a bad place.



His back's against the wall.



I didn't know he
was gonna go that far.



Dad, please!



I think you should
leave, Michael.



With all due respect,
Mr. Miller--



I'd like you to leave right now.



Kerry, can we go
someplace else...



so we can finish
the conversation?



Good night, Michael.



- Kerry?
- I want you out of here.



I think you're
overreacting, Mr. Miller.



Your father comes to my
brother's house...



in the middle of the night.



We're thinking about pressing
harassment charges against him.



Harassment charges?



Quite a lowlife,
resorting to scare tactics.



What do you call your nephew
showing up at the auction?



Is that a lowlife move?



Because it seems like
a lowlife move to me.



I'd like you to leave right now.



Kerry, please
can we go and talk?



Yes, we can.



You are not taking one step
out of this house tonight.



Kerry.



She's not sixteen years old
anymore, Mr.--



What did you do?



I don't want to get
into this tonight.



No. You are getting
into this tonight.



Did you put your hands on him?



Michael, I verbally
spanked the guy. That's all.



Well, while you were
screaming at him...



you think maybe you put me
in a difficult position?



He's a member of Kerry's family.



So that gives him the right
to fuck with me?



Why didn't you just
let me go with you?



There are other ways
to get things done, Dad.



You do not always have
to be so fucking harsh!



Michael!



I was trying to protect
my business!



And I did what I had to do.



I know.



Well.



Gorgeous.



I thought you'd never ask me.



This is gorgeous.



Which one do you like better?



This one. This.



This one. Amazing.



Thanks.



Where did you get these?



I can't tell you.



Do I even have to ask you
which one you--



Yeah. Of course.



I knew that.



Amazing.



Did you have a plan?



Yeah. I did.



It got messed up.



Well, you can surprise me later.



OK.



Holy shit.



Tommy!



The crates are gone!



Do you believe this shit?



Michael, can you still
operate this thing?



You want to turn it on?



Yeah. Come on, Dad.



Some of them might have cut
deep into the harbor.



Don't come back empty-handed.



There's one right there
to the right.



Just a little bit, Michael.



Get the other one, man.



I can't get out there.
What do you want me to do, swim?



We lost some. We lost--



Leave them on the line.
We'll drag them in.



- Watch the front.
- I got it.



Bring them on home.



You did a good job out there.



Looked like
a fuckin' lobster rodeo.



You ought to sell
tickets next time.



You gonna see Kerry?



Yeah.



Take her out to dinner.



No, that's OK, Dad. Thanks.



Come on. Nice steak,
bottle of red wine...



you'll be right back to normal.



Come on.



All right. Thanks, Dad.



It's all right.



What the hell is that?



Here you go.



Talk to Tommy C.



Tommy C?



What the fuck?



I got the last crate, though.
I just want to say.



You did get
the last crate, babe.



She was amazing out there.



Thank God for
the three of you...



because I get seasick
in the bathtub, you know that.



It's ridiculous.



All the skin curling.



- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.



Hi.



Justin and I were
just making nicey-nice.



I should go check on Aimee.



Yeah. OK.



Good night, Dad.



Good night, Mom.



- Good night, Frank.
- Good night, kids.



So when are you moving?



First week in January.



I got to go.



You want to grab some dinner?



No, that's OK.



What's OK?



Everything's OK.



Are you OK?



I'm fine.



What the hell's going on here?



What's this all about?



It's like you didn't know
you were marrying...



a stubborn bastard.



You weren't a stubborn bastard
when I married you.



You were sweet.



Oh, come on.
We were courting.



Oh, Jesus, Frank.



So that's your move now.



Die alone.



That's my move.



There was never any time
for us, Frank.



Maureen, I had
a business to run.



Yeah!



Tony got it going, huh?



Crazy bastard's good
for something.



You want us to bring
all the crates back in?



Frank, you want me and Jamal to
bring everything back in?



You know what, Tom?
I was thinking.



Maybe...



Maybe, we bring
just ten in, huh?



You just want ten? You sure?



Or maybe--



No. I think ten is
good right now just in case.



Today's the big day, huh?



You look sharp.



I look like who did it and ran.
You kidding?



I'll pull those ten, OK?



Thank you, Tommy.

- Tommy. How are you?
- Good to see you, man.



So you guys moving back
to New York?



Looks that way.



We just have to set
something up.



Well, you can always work
at Lobster Land...



until something pans out.



I figured I could count on that.



Are you gonna be OK, Mom?



Yeah, I'll be fine.



Thanks, honey.



I have a toast I want to give.



Your father taught me this
a long time ago...



and I translated it.



Now it's a very popular
toast in China.



All right. Chinatown.



Means, punch me all you like,
you can't knock me down.



Very, very eloquent, Bill.



All right, Frank, come on.
Your turn.



Come on. Boss don't
get off that easy.



Come on.



As you know, my life
has been on fire...



for these last five years...



but it's not easy
admitting to need...



but you've all made me
realize there's no shame...



in needing family...



immediate family...



my extended lobster family.



Now I know I can be
a royal pain in the ass.



Jesus. I truly don't know how
anybody could be sitting...



around this table
with me right now.



I mean, it blows my mind.



Well, the crustaceans are
getting cold...



so I'll try to wrap it up
with a simple thank you.



Unless you want me
to sing a song.



No!



Come on!



And when you're done here,
I want you all to get...



your hats and coats
and we'll meet outside...



because there's one more order
of unfinished business.



All right? Cheers.



- Cheers.
- Salute.



Well, we've been getting
some strange reports...



from the listeners in Brooklyn
about Santa Claus.



Cousins, it appears
that he's given up...



not only his reindeer this year
but his sleigh, as well...



and traded them in for--
ready for this--



a giant lobster.



Yeah. I said a lobster.



Either they've all
gone mad there...



or someone is making
some really good eggnog...



in Sheepshead Bay.



But let's keep things
going here...



with more of your
favorite hits, cousins...



and this one goes off to you,
Santa and his claws.



Did I say that?
Yeah, I did.



And it comes from Frimpy Irwin
of Ebbets Field.
