1
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:20,865
Huh! Hello, Lady.

2
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:23,561
Edith? You okay in there?

3
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,161
Yes, dear, I'm fine.

4
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:27,899
Do you need anything
from the store?

5
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:28,702
Hurry up, guys.

6
00:05:28,808 --> 00:05:30,537
Clara!
You're going to be late for school!

7
00:05:31,578 --> 00:05:33,045
Orange juice, perhaps.

8
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:34,477
Does Lady need food?

9
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:36,014
I don't know.

10
00:05:36,116 --> 00:05:37,777
Okay, well,
I'm closing the door now, Edith.

11
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:39,010
It's not safe to leave it open.

12
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:41,110
'Cause I live in a firetrap.

13
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:41,812
Come on.

14
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:44,913
It's not a firetrap.
That's a treasure trove.

15
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:48,222
If stacks of stuff dated from
the '50s count as a treasure trove.

16
00:05:48,328 --> 00:05:49,852
Oh, they do.

17
00:05:49,963 --> 00:05:52,454
Avery, you're gonna have
to move the car today, remember?

18
00:05:52,565 --> 00:05:53,122
Right.

19
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:54,757
You sit in it with Lucas
and hold our spot...

20
00:05:54,868 --> 00:05:56,130
...and I'll walk Clara over.
- Right.

21
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,243
Okay!

22
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:08,781
Oh... Come on, sweetie.

23
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,142
Careful, guys.

24
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:14,046
Careful, guys.

25
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:21,722
Didn't I just clean this out
last week?

26
00:06:23,396 --> 00:06:26,388
Hey, check it out.
Look at those books!

27
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:28,558
Think we can get them
before mom notices?

28
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:29,760
No, Avery, please.

29
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:32,770
Put your family's best interest first.
Think of the common good.

30
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:34,601
That's exactly what I'm doing.

31
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,233
That's exactly what I'm doing.

32
00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:40,806
Okay, in the car we go.

33
00:06:40,914 --> 00:06:41,744
Can I have some?

34
00:06:52,926 --> 00:06:55,121
I wish I was French, too.

35
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:59,062
It's my birthday tomorrow.
I'm gonna be six!

36
00:06:59,165 --> 00:07:01,463
And I'm having my party
up there tonight!

37
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:04,196
Really?
In your apartment.

38
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:08,365
For my sixth birthday,
we had a private marionette show.

39
00:07:08,475 --> 00:07:10,705
I'm gonna have 10 friends!

40
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,277
My seventh
was at the Swedish Cottage.

41
00:07:12,378 --> 00:07:15,142
First, my mom said I could
only have six friends

42
00:07:15,248 --> 00:07:16,647
because I'm gonna be six.

43
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,686
Then, Serendipity 3
delivered frozen hot chocolate.

44
00:07:20,787 --> 00:07:23,688
But then, my dad talked her
into letting me have 10.

45
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,258
Afterwards, my friends and I
got carriage rides

46
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:28,259
in Central Park at sunset.

47
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:31,694
I'm gonna have a triple layer cake,
with purple frosting.

48
00:07:31,798 --> 00:07:35,131
And I'm gonna have
really cool goodie bags,

49
00:07:35,235 --> 00:07:37,703
right, Mom?

50
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:39,203
Not the goodie bags again.

51
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:41,398
Eliza, you are brave.

52
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:43,635
Really? How so?

53
00:07:43,743 --> 00:07:45,335
Just to live as you do, you know?

54
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:49,074
The stairs, the children,
the car, the dog.

55
00:07:49,182 --> 00:07:51,412
It's a bit exhausting, no?

56
00:07:51,518 --> 00:07:53,986
Is that your definition of "brave"?

57
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:57,750
Eliza, could you give me a hand
with this buckle?

58
00:07:57,857 --> 00:07:59,984
Um, Mom, you forgot my backpack,

59
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:02,960
and I definitely need it
before choice time.

60
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:03,926
Okay.

61
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,088
Eliza, are you...?

62
00:08:05,198 --> 00:08:07,530
Are you wearing your nightgown?

63
00:08:29,222 --> 00:08:30,621
Has it really come to this?

64
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:32,384
That I, Eliz a K. Welch,

65
00:08:32,492 --> 00:08:34,824
find myself humiliated
in my nightgown

66
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:36,953
in front of my neighbor's
townhouse?

67
00:08:37,063 --> 00:08:40,089
My husband has run Clara
around the corner to P.S. 3,

68
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,668
and I have exactly
nine minutes to write.

69
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:44,566
How can a mother
articulate her ideas

70
00:08:44,671 --> 00:08:47,231
with anything approaching
wit or conviction

71
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,036
in such ridiculously
tiny wedges of time?

72
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,057
Oh, it's ZachsMommy again.

73
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,128
"Quit complaining, SanctaMommy!

74
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:11,493
No one has any time.

75
00:09:11,598 --> 00:09:15,500
Save your quest for self-expression
until the kids go off to college."

76
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,931
Must a woman's soul
wither and die

77
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:22,371
simply because she opted
to become a mother?

78
00:09:22,475 --> 00:09:25,308
I want to finish the laundry
and a complex sentence,

79
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:27,072
to think tantalizingly
deep thoughts

80
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,978
and throw a magical birthday party
for my daughter.

81
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:34,213
Is that truly too much to ask?

82
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:48,066
Tomorrow, Clara turns six.

83
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:50,829
She's more than half way
to double digits.

84
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:54,498
She'll be going to college
in 12 years.

85
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:58,475
That used to seem
like a long time.

86
00:09:58,578 --> 00:10:01,809
Now I can blink,
and it'd be over.

87
00:10:15,495 --> 00:10:18,328
"Speak your mind and become
our resident Mom-ologist

88
00:10:18,431 --> 00:10:20,194
with your very own column,

89
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,598
worth up to 3,000 dollars a month!

90
00:10:22,702 --> 00:10:24,431
Runners-up receive
either 1,000 dollars

91
00:10:24,537 --> 00:10:27,563
or an all-expense paid trip
to this year's Mamapaloo z a,

92
00:10:27,674 --> 00:10:30,404
the festival for moms who rock."

93
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,000
You've gotta be kidding me.

94
00:10:32,111 --> 00:10:36,343
"Just send us 500 words telling us
what motherhood means to you."

95
00:10:37,383 --> 00:10:40,079
Oh, my God!

96
00:10:40,186 --> 00:10:40,880
It's perfect!

97
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:45,148
Oh, no.

98
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,024
Folks, coming up,

99
00:10:55,134 --> 00:11:00,663
we're going to see the historic former
home of Edna St. Vincent Millay.

100
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:02,297
But first,
get those cameras ready...

101
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:02,965
Excuse me.

102
00:11:03,076 --> 00:11:05,442
This is a neighborhood, people,
not a theme park.

103
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:06,239
"Get her picture! Get her...!

104
00:11:06,346 --> 00:11:09,315
"Here's the corner we all know
and love from Friends."

105
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:11,474
Though, whenever you see
an inside shot,

106
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:15,042
that was actually filmed
on a soundstage in Los Angeles.

107
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:17,645
Hurry, kids! Hurry! Come on!

108
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:23,728
Hey! Sheila! Sheila!

109
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,594
Hi! What's shakin', babe?

110
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:28,496
Do I have
Joan Crawford eyebrows?

111
00:11:28,601 --> 00:11:31,468
I applied pencil like it was
magic marker, and I didn't check.

112
00:11:31,571 --> 00:11:33,004
Tell me the truth.

113
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:35,131
No, they look good.
They're, 'ya know, zesty.

114
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:36,902
Zesty?

115
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,342
I have to have this in Clara's
classroom by choice time,

116
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:40,605
or it's sudden death
for Bad Mommy.

117
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:42,374
- Will you walk with me?
- Sure.

118
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:45,414
Hey, do you want me

119
00:11:45,518 --> 00:11:47,110
to pick up Clara
and bring her with us?

120
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,585
'Cause I know Trixie
would love it.

121
00:11:48,688 --> 00:11:50,713
But I thought Joel
had the kids on Fridays.

122
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:52,188
Oh, he's in Santa Fe.

123
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,486
Oh... Chasing another
new wild potter?

124
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:57,461
I don't know. Maybe.
Who cares?

125
00:11:57,563 --> 00:11:59,326
I've really gotta
go for this, right?

126
00:11:59,432 --> 00:12:03,869
I mean, there's something validating
about having a real job, you know?

127
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,130
It's been awhile.

128
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:08,935
Yeah, there's definitely something
validating about having a real job.

129
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:11,442
I mean, especially one
that actually pays you more

130
00:12:11,544 --> 00:12:13,478
than the childcare
required to do it.

131
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:15,604
And it has been awhile.

132
00:12:15,715 --> 00:12:16,807
You sure you're ready to move

133
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,474
beyond entourages
of organic snacks?

134
00:12:19,385 --> 00:12:20,579
Completely!

135
00:12:20,686 --> 00:12:22,654
I mean, it gives me a chance
to explore what it really means

136
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:26,384
to become a mother,
and nobody talks about this stuff.

137
00:12:26,492 --> 00:12:28,392
The sleep deprivation,

138
00:12:28,494 --> 00:12:32,931
the funks, the non-stop cleaning,
the death of lust.

139
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:36,433
I can see Lunchbo x magazine
flying off the stands.

140
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:38,561
Here's my first headline:

141
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:42,732
"To thine own self be true:
Don't Breed."

142
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:43,866
Too late.

143
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:04,590
Hi, Trixie!

144
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:09,695
Shit!

145
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:12,930
- What?
- Avery forgot to walk Coupon!

146
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:13,869
Shit is right.

147
00:13:13,973 --> 00:13:18,774
You better get home, or you're
gonna find a deposit on your rug.

148
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,114
Avery?

149
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:32,314
Avery.

150
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:35,023
Avery.

151
00:13:35,328 --> 00:13:37,922
This stuff is incredible, really.

152
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,261
Uh, Avery, um, did you forget
something this morning?

153
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:42,231
What?

154
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:44,633
I don't know, it was essentially
our firstborn, you know?

155
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:46,432
The one
with the incontinence issues?

156
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:47,767
Oops, sorry.

157
00:13:47,874 --> 00:13:50,104
Single most abused word
in the English language.

158
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:51,267
"Oops" or "sorry"?

159
00:13:51,377 --> 00:13:54,175
All right, so I'll stay with Lucas,
and you go get Coupon.

160
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,804
Oh, no, no, no.
You can't do that.

161
00:13:55,915 --> 00:13:57,974
I got an editorial meeting at 9:30.

162
00:13:58,084 --> 00:13:59,210
If I don't leave now,
I'm never gonna make it.

163
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:00,717
No, no, no, no!
You never told me that!

164
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,550
Yes, I did. I told you this morning
while you were combing Clara's hair.

165
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:04,918
Don't worry, I'll be back by 1:00.

166
00:14:05,024 --> 00:14:06,286
No, but 1:00 is too late!

167
00:14:06,392 --> 00:14:08,087
I don't think Coupon
can hold it till then,

168
00:14:08,194 --> 00:14:09,491
and he can't walk himself

169
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:11,187
because he can't make it
down the stairs anymore.

170
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:11,786
Holy Moly!

171
00:14:11,898 --> 00:14:13,331
Did you go
to the cash machine at least?

172
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:16,959
Eliza, I wish you would stop
talking to me like I'm impaired.

173
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:18,832
Yes, I did.

174
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:20,405
I... No... I'm sorry, okay?

175
00:14:20,506 --> 00:14:22,770
There's just something I want
to do today. It's incredible.

176
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,901
It's this writing thing, which
could be just perfect for me and...

177
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:31,473
I guess I'll just figure out
how to get it all done by myself.

178
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:33,984
- Bye!
- Bye!

179
00:14:56,642 --> 00:14:59,304
Oh, come on.

180
00:14:59,412 --> 00:15:00,674
I got ya!

181
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:04,945
Orange juice.

182
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:07,713
Edith?
I forgot your orange juice.

183
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,152
I'm sorry,
I'll bring you some more later?

184
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:15,751
Orange juice?
I don't need any orange juice, dear.

185
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:19,228
I'm closing the door now, Edith.
It's not safe to leave it open.

186
00:15:23,402 --> 00:15:24,300
Okay.

187
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:37,809
Hurry up, Coupon, let's go.

188
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:41,182
Street sweeper! Street sweeper!

189
00:15:41,287 --> 00:15:44,984
Oh! Oh, God. Coupon! Get busy.

190
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:45,819
Get busy.

191
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:48,052
Get a Prius, New Jersey!

192
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,151
Go home, scumbag!

193
00:15:53,032 --> 00:15:55,694
Good job, Coupon!
Good boy!

194
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:02,634
So, you just gonna leave it there?

195
00:16:02,742 --> 00:16:05,609
No, I just, I gotta get my kid
in the car,

196
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:09,203
so I can move the car, so the street
sweeper can clean the street.

197
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,647
I'll pick it up later.

198
00:16:12,752 --> 00:16:15,084
What if someone
steps in it before then?

199
00:16:15,187 --> 00:16:17,587
I'll call 311 and make a complaint.

200
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:21,148
Well, I haven't found that
very effective, but be my guest.

201
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,557
Here, honey.

202
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:29,598
And you're not even
going to strap him in?

203
00:16:29,635 --> 00:16:30,659
Give me a break.

204
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:32,927
Okay...

205
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:37,438
Oh, no!

206
00:16:51,991 --> 00:16:54,516
Come on, lady, move it!

207
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:57,287
Now where the hell is this guy?

208
00:16:58,297 --> 00:16:59,696
What's going on?

209
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:02,427
Every Tuesday and Friday
you gotta move your car

210
00:17:02,535 --> 00:17:04,059
so they can clean the street.

211
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,537
Oh, except this one here.
They're from Jersey.

212
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,369
They leave it,
and then pay the ticket.

213
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:10,999
It's cheaper than a garage.

214
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,704
And then the street sweeper
can't get around!

215
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,107
Hey, move it, Volvo lady!

216
00:17:16,215 --> 00:17:17,546
Move that freakin' car!

217
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,551
I can't, I'll lose my spot!

218
00:17:20,653 --> 00:17:22,621
Why doesn't everybody just back up?

219
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:24,485
Come on!
Move your car!

220
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,921
Come around!

221
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:28,152
We can't move, 'ya cunt!

222
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:33,322
Motherfucker!

223
00:17:33,432 --> 00:17:34,524
What is that woman doing?

224
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:35,998
She's nuts.

225
00:17:36,102 --> 00:17:38,400
Look, that's her dog shit.
She just left it there.

226
00:17:38,504 --> 00:17:39,835
- Oh!
- Give him hell!

227
00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:41,463
Did you just say
what I think you said?

228
00:17:41,574 --> 00:17:42,506
Yeah, that's right, you heard me.

229
00:17:42,608 --> 00:17:45,873
You just used the C-word in front
of a child, in front of a school!

230
00:17:45,978 --> 00:17:47,775
Your mother must be
very proud of you.

231
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,574
Hey, you leave my mother
out of this!

232
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:49,238
No, no, no.

233
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:51,908
She must be very, very proud
that her son grew up to be...

234
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:53,382
What do you do?
Oh, roofing!

235
00:17:53,486 --> 00:17:55,113
That her son's a roofer.

236
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:56,245
- Shut up, lady.
- Impressive.

237
00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:58,619
Do they give you a degree in that?
Advanced shingling?

238
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:01,192
Hey, I said, shut up!

239
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:07,790
All right, I'm sorry
that I insulted your profession.

240
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,663
Well, somebody's gotta fix roofs.

241
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:11,828
Right. Agreed.

242
00:18:11,937 --> 00:18:13,529
I mean, I'm one to talk.

243
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:16,836
I'm just trying to raise two kids
in this godforsaken city

244
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:18,842
that's a shadow of its former self.

245
00:18:18,944 --> 00:18:21,037
Do you ever think about maybe
moving out to the suburbs?

246
00:18:21,147 --> 00:18:23,172
Like we could afford the taxes!

247
00:18:23,282 --> 00:18:25,341
Yeah, I hear you on that.
I hear you on that.

248
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:28,352
He's escaping!
Somebody call the police!

249
00:18:28,454 --> 00:18:29,648
Hey, you better get up there!

250
00:18:29,755 --> 00:18:30,983
Oh! Oh!

251
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,114
No!

252
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:34,826
Move the car!
This isn't a parking lot!

253
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:35,951
What are you doing?

254
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:40,464
Oh! Sweetie! Sweetie! Oh, no, no, no!
I'm so sorry. Back you go.

255
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:41,828
Report her to social services!

256
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:43,697
Hey, cut the lady some slack.

257
00:18:43,803 --> 00:18:46,271
Can't you see
she's having a hard day?

258
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:46,963
Thank you.

259
00:18:56,148 --> 00:19:00,482
Oh, watch out! Oh! Oh!

260
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:01,211
Look.

261
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:11,120
Lucas, sweetie, I am so sorry
I left you all alone like that.

262
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,698
And mommy's sorry
she was smoking, too.

263
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,790
And yelling.

264
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:18,734
Smoking and yelling are two things
that Lunchbo x Magazine

265
00:19:18,838 --> 00:19:19,930
would tell you to avoid.

266
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,771
I'm sorry.

267
00:19:25,878 --> 00:19:30,178
Mommy's just gonna, just race
around the block as fast as she can.

268
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:31,613
As quick as a wink!

269
00:19:31,717 --> 00:19:32,445
A wink!

270
00:19:34,186 --> 00:19:36,848
Oh! I'm gonna lose my spot!

271
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:37,888
Oh, no.

272
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:39,714
Don't!

273
00:19:39,825 --> 00:19:45,229
Oh, no-no-no-no-no!
Hey! No, no, no!

274
00:19:53,606 --> 00:19:55,540
All right, one sec.

275
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:57,131
Don't, don't, don't.

276
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:04,682
Excuse me!

277
00:20:04,783 --> 00:20:08,617
Look, I'm sorry to bother you!

278
00:20:08,787 --> 00:20:13,520
I know you're not napping because
I saw you just pull into my spot.

279
00:20:13,626 --> 00:20:15,253
It's not your spot.

280
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:16,328
But I live here.

281
00:20:16,428 --> 00:20:18,555
You live in the West Village, so you
can afford to park someplace else.

282
00:20:18,664 --> 00:20:20,996
No, you can say that,
but you'd be wrong, okay?

283
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,627
My apartment is right there,
rather I should say, our apartments.

284
00:20:24,737 --> 00:20:26,898
You've got more
than one apartment?

285
00:20:27,006 --> 00:20:29,497
They're rent stabilized,
and one is a studio.

286
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:32,236
Look, I'm throwing a birthday party
for my daughter tonight,

287
00:20:32,344 --> 00:20:35,279
and I need to park here
so I can stash stuff in the car.

288
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:37,144
That is, if I can fit anything,

289
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:40,650
considering my husband has filled
the back of the car with old books.

290
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:42,277
You see, he has this fantasy

291
00:20:42,388 --> 00:20:46,154
of starting an online rare book
business to enrich our lifestyle.

292
00:20:46,258 --> 00:20:47,748
How about that?

293
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,590
Anyway, we live in a walk-up.

294
00:20:52,431 --> 00:20:53,864
Oh!

295
00:21:01,974 --> 00:21:02,770
Come on!

296
00:21:19,491 --> 00:21:22,392
"My, what a wonderful house
this would be.

297
00:21:22,494 --> 00:21:26,794
I will live in it until the people
who own it come for it.

298
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:29,060
And then, the little old man..."

299
00:21:29,168 --> 00:21:32,365
Oh, that's us. Okay.
Come on, sweetie.

300
00:21:32,471 --> 00:21:37,636
Ah... Okay, here we go.

301
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:39,570
Ooh!

302
00:21:39,678 --> 00:21:42,841
Come, sweetie, here we go.

303
00:21:45,217 --> 00:21:47,811
Yeah...

304
00:22:17,149 --> 00:22:19,174
Good sharing, Courtney!

305
00:22:19,284 --> 00:22:23,448
I am very proud of you
for your excellent sharing.

306
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,917
No, no, drop it.

307
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:28,391
That's made in China.

308
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:31,992
Hey! Watch it.

309
00:22:32,097 --> 00:22:34,031
He's a whole lot smaller than you.

310
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:36,067
Excuse me,
did you just say something?

311
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:37,396
Did she say something to you, Jordan?

312
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:41,098
Look, I'm sorry, but your son
nearly crushed my kid.

313
00:22:41,206 --> 00:22:42,537
He's a whole lot bigger.

314
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:44,040
Are you saying
my son's overweight?

315
00:22:44,143 --> 00:22:47,442
I said big.
Actually, what I said was "bigger."

316
00:22:47,546 --> 00:22:50,037
Don't you dare
ever speak to him again.

317
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:51,480
It's glandular!

318
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:58,920
No, Trish.
Trish, you cook pot roast at 375.

319
00:22:59,024 --> 00:22:59,922
Yeah.

320
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:05,088
And don't forget to mail
the Con-Ed bill, please.

321
00:23:05,197 --> 00:23:07,961
My wife.

322
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:11,935
Yeah, okay, bye.

323
00:23:12,037 --> 00:23:13,629
Jodie Foster alert.

324
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:14,763
Excuse me?

325
00:23:14,873 --> 00:23:18,502
I swear to God, it's Jodie!
She's coming in right now.

326
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:22,068
Jodie, Jodie!
Over here, Jodie! Who's the father?

327
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:24,809
Last week, I had
a Sarah Jessica Parker sighting.

328
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:29,149
I've seen Julianne Moore,
Kate Winslet, and James Gandolfini.

329
00:23:29,254 --> 00:23:31,279
I swear, it's like a movie star
playground.

330
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:34,154
I come in all the way from Scarsdale
because, you know, you never know,

331
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:37,854
I could sell it to Us, right?

332
00:23:37,963 --> 00:23:39,396
Who's your baby-daddy, Jodie?

333
00:23:39,498 --> 00:23:42,934
You should work in a soup
kitchen, you fucking parasites.

334
00:23:43,035 --> 00:23:45,833
Here you go, honey.
Got your jacket?

335
00:23:45,938 --> 00:23:47,838
Should a mother
really have to choose

336
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,534
between simply getting
her kid some fresh air

337
00:23:50,642 --> 00:23:52,701
and being stalked
by the mamaraz zi?

338
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:56,343
Hey, Eliza.

339
00:23:56,448 --> 00:23:58,643
Hey, Lily! Hey, Bodhi!

340
00:23:58,751 --> 00:23:59,683
- Say hi.
- Hi.

341
00:23:59,785 --> 00:24:01,252
What's with the HAZMAT suit?

342
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:04,049
Oh, this?
It's a UV-protection robe.

343
00:24:04,156 --> 00:24:07,387
I got it for Bodhi off this website.
They make them in Australia.

344
00:24:07,493 --> 00:24:08,892
Because of the warming.

345
00:24:08,994 --> 00:24:10,393
Ah...

346
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:14,728
I hate to say this, but he kinda
looks like a little baby Klansman.

347
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:19,566
Oh, well, it cuts out 99 percent
of harmful rays.

348
00:24:19,671 --> 00:24:22,697
I can send you the link if you want.
I got Indy a poncho off it.

349
00:24:22,808 --> 00:24:25,038
Maybe Clara would want one.

350
00:24:25,144 --> 00:24:26,873
It's okay.

351
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:30,073
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt you.

352
00:24:30,182 --> 00:24:34,141
No, no, no. I'm just...
entering this contest.

353
00:24:34,253 --> 00:24:37,882
Really? What's the contest?

354
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,824
Just write 500 words about
what motherhood means to me.

355
00:24:41,927 --> 00:24:43,019
What are you gonna say?

356
00:24:43,128 --> 00:24:49,533
Um...
Stuff, I guess. I don't know.

357
00:24:49,635 --> 00:24:52,297
How motherhood
is all about rainbows and unicorns

358
00:24:52,404 --> 00:24:55,498
and sunny days and...

359
00:24:55,607 --> 00:24:57,165
I've got something up my sleeve.

360
00:24:57,276 --> 00:24:58,641
Okay.

361
00:24:58,744 --> 00:25:00,109
Hey, do you want to borrow some?

362
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:02,578
It's cruelty and chemical free.
They make it in Oregon.

363
00:25:02,681 --> 00:25:04,649
No, thanks.

364
00:25:35,914 --> 00:25:41,250
Lily? Lily, what are you doing?

365
00:25:41,353 --> 00:25:43,787
Oh, haven't you read
The Crying and the Raging?

366
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:48,816
It's the most amazing book.

367
00:25:48,927 --> 00:25:51,794
This pediatrician in Norway
came up with the theory

368
00:25:51,897 --> 00:25:55,025
that if you really connect
with your child in his moment of pain,

369
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:57,124
it calms them down.

370
00:25:57,236 --> 00:25:59,261
It's really made a difference
for me and Bodhi.

371
00:25:59,371 --> 00:26:01,100
Lily, will you excuse me
for a second?

372
00:26:01,206 --> 00:26:03,504
Oh, sure.

373
00:26:03,609 --> 00:26:05,736
Are you feeling better?

374
00:26:05,844 --> 00:26:09,109
Do you have the hiccups?

375
00:26:09,214 --> 00:26:12,012
Let's look around
and see what we see.

376
00:26:12,117 --> 00:26:17,646
I think I see a little chipmunk.
Oh, that's not a chipmunk.

377
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:21,619
I don't have
the faintest notion

378
00:26:21,727 --> 00:26:23,422
what motherhood means to me,
you know what I mean?

379
00:26:23,528 --> 00:26:26,622
Since when does a stroller
have to cost as much as a car?

380
00:26:26,732 --> 00:26:28,791
Okay, a used car.

381
00:26:28,901 --> 00:26:30,835
Since the world
has started breeding more.

382
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:32,699
- Oh!
- What?

383
00:26:32,804 --> 00:26:35,272
- I can't believe...
- What?

384
00:26:35,374 --> 00:26:37,399
They towed my goddamn car!

385
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:38,840
- Oh, shit.
- Oh!

386
00:26:38,944 --> 00:26:40,639
Please leave your message at the beep.

387
00:26:40,746 --> 00:26:42,338
Avery, where are you?

388
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:46,815
I'm freaking out, okay?
They're shooting on our block again.

389
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:49,820
They moved the cars.
Call me as soon as you get this.

390
00:26:49,922 --> 00:26:50,650
I gotta go. Bye.

391
00:26:50,756 --> 00:26:52,656
Where is my car?

392
00:26:52,758 --> 00:26:53,884
We have a resident here.

393
00:26:53,992 --> 00:26:54,754
She can pick up her car anytime.

394
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,451
Copy that.

395
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,652
Who moved it?

396
00:26:56,762 --> 00:26:59,890
Well, there's signs on all the posts.
Check them. No parking today.

397
00:26:59,998 --> 00:27:03,058
There were no signs
when I left it here an hour ago.

398
00:27:03,168 --> 00:27:04,726
- Right there!
- Ma'am, look...

399
00:27:04,836 --> 00:27:05,700
Don't "ma'am" me!

400
00:27:05,804 --> 00:27:07,772
I may technically be old enough
to be your mother,

401
00:27:07,873 --> 00:27:08,965
but I am not a "ma'am."

402
00:27:09,074 --> 00:27:10,063
The car's been moved

403
00:27:10,175 --> 00:27:11,540
to a secure location
on Barrow Street,

404
00:27:11,643 --> 00:27:13,270
all the way west.

405
00:27:13,378 --> 00:27:16,370
Film crews are supposed
to give 24-hour notice.

406
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:17,971
I can give you the number
to the mayor's office

407
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:19,846
if you'd like to call
and file a complaint.

408
00:27:19,952 --> 00:27:21,283
Very helpful. Great.

409
00:27:21,386 --> 00:27:25,618
You're telling me that you towed
my car, and I have to bite it, right?

410
00:27:25,724 --> 00:27:27,521
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you
to cross the street.

411
00:27:27,626 --> 00:27:28,854
We're setting up here.

412
00:27:28,961 --> 00:27:30,588
Hester, can you believe this?

413
00:27:30,696 --> 00:27:33,688
I'm gonna piss in a pot
and dump it on 'em later.

414
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,630
Out the window, splat.

415
00:27:35,734 --> 00:27:37,565
Right on!

416
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:43,671
Danny, go to two.

417
00:27:44,176 --> 00:27:48,510
Why is it that once
you pass 35 and have a kid in tow,

418
00:27:48,547 --> 00:27:51,311
you automatically
become a "ma'am"?

419
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:55,309
"Ma'am" means support hose,
a girdle, a bad perm.

420
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:58,389
I'll wear hot pants and platforms
when I'm on a walker

421
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:03,621
if only to avoid
being called "ma'am."

422
00:28:15,741 --> 00:28:19,472
Avery, Avery, Avery!
Answer your phone for once, Avery!

423
00:28:19,578 --> 00:28:21,011
You've reached Avery.
Please leave your message...

424
00:28:30,555 --> 00:28:34,787
I used to be fluid,
I used to be, I don't know, graceful.

425
00:28:34,893 --> 00:28:38,761
Now my words come out,
and they just sound like bad ad copy.

426
00:28:38,864 --> 00:28:42,561
Well, maybe your brain's
worn out from over-sharing.

427
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:46,159
Sheila, just blog-slam me
when I'm down!

428
00:28:48,106 --> 00:28:50,574
Avery lost his cell phone,
by the way,

429
00:28:50,675 --> 00:28:52,267
the ultimate passive-aggressive act.

430
00:28:52,377 --> 00:28:54,902
Avery would lose his scrotum
if it wasn't attached.

431
00:28:55,013 --> 00:28:56,878
Well, it's either that,
or he silenced it,

432
00:28:56,982 --> 00:29:00,611
which is the most effective way
of silencing me.

433
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:06,248
Ah... No longer my problem,
being silenced.

434
00:29:06,358 --> 00:29:08,349
I mean,
God forbid I ever raised a topic

435
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,419
from Joel's top 10 list
of "musts to avoid."

436
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:15,193
Like, why you can't balance
his checkbook.

437
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,895
Or vacuum. Or remember
the substitute teacher's name.

438
00:29:19,004 --> 00:29:21,734
Or tolerate a single comment
about September 11

439
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,239
at the dinner table.

440
00:29:23,341 --> 00:29:25,809
God, maybe that's gonna show up
in the divorce papers.

441
00:29:25,911 --> 00:29:28,471
"Refused to stop referencing
traumatic event

442
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,571
more than six years
after the fact."

443
00:29:30,682 --> 00:29:31,444
Mm-hmm.

444
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:35,543
"By the way,
'Why can't you just get over it?"'

445
00:29:35,654 --> 00:29:37,451
I'll tell you why.

446
00:29:37,556 --> 00:29:41,925
'Cause you're always thinking,
you're always wondering, "What if?"

447
00:29:42,027 --> 00:29:44,723
I mean, have I done everything
I could possibly do

448
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:48,129
to stave off disaster?

449
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:51,361
Did I tell Clara how much I loved her
this morning before school,

450
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,994
just in case
she never makes it home again.

451
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:55,665
Oh, Liz, you gotta stop.

452
00:29:55,774 --> 00:29:58,334
I can't stop.

453
00:29:58,443 --> 00:30:00,911
Well, as a fearless leader
once said,

454
00:30:01,012 --> 00:30:05,449
"When you can't stop,
you must shop."

455
00:30:19,131 --> 00:30:21,656
You know, the grand irony
of the whole thing

456
00:30:21,766 --> 00:30:26,465
is that the first time around,
all I wanted...

457
00:30:26,571 --> 00:30:27,868
Thank you.

458
00:30:27,973 --> 00:30:31,033
...was for Joel to leave me alone
and not touch me.

459
00:30:31,143 --> 00:30:32,542
Well, that was because
your joints ached.

460
00:30:32,644 --> 00:30:34,578
And I had to pee
every five seconds.

461
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:36,874
Which is better than peeing
all over yourself,

462
00:30:36,982 --> 00:30:39,576
which is what you do
after you give birth.

463
00:30:39,684 --> 00:30:41,948
Yeah, the cruel twist of fate
is that at this time,

464
00:30:42,053 --> 00:30:44,112
all the women do is shag.

465
00:30:44,222 --> 00:30:46,122
And there is nobody to shag me.

466
00:30:46,224 --> 00:30:48,385
She got pregnant
through sympathy sex.

467
00:30:48,493 --> 00:30:50,723
Her husband felt guilty
after he ran off,

468
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:53,297
so he sent the kids out with a sitter,
got a bottle of wine,

469
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:54,729
and jumped on her.

470
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:56,095
Shagged me madly.

471
00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:57,566
Got her pregnant...

472
00:30:57,669 --> 00:30:58,693
And then he left her.

473
00:30:58,803 --> 00:31:00,065
Pig!

474
00:31:00,172 --> 00:31:02,333
Oh, yeah.

475
00:31:04,376 --> 00:31:05,308
Hey, you guys...

476
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,674
- That's nice.
- It's pretty, yeah.

477
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:09,508
For a 6-year-old.

478
00:31:09,614 --> 00:31:11,081
I gotta tell you something.

479
00:31:11,183 --> 00:31:13,413
It does not leave this room.

480
00:31:13,518 --> 00:31:17,682
Okay, so last night,
I got the kids to bed about 9:00,

481
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:18,881
and I ran a bath,

482
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,116
which would have been
really lovely

483
00:31:20,225 --> 00:31:22,489
except I only had that
Strawberry Shortcake bubble bath.

484
00:31:22,594 --> 00:31:27,531
- So I'm lying there, in the bath...
- Yeah...

485
00:31:27,632 --> 00:31:29,361
naked...

486
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:30,866
What? What?

487
00:31:30,969 --> 00:31:31,799
Good!

488
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:36,998
You know the little, um,
motorized submarine bath toys...

489
00:31:37,108 --> 00:31:39,508
- The little, "Chiggachiggachigga..."
- Yeah.

490
00:31:39,611 --> 00:31:41,704
Oh!

491
00:31:41,813 --> 00:31:42,939
What?

492
00:31:43,381 --> 00:31:45,178
You know, they look
a bit like dildos.

493
00:31:48,186 --> 00:31:48,982
You're dirty!

494
00:31:50,388 --> 00:31:53,118
It was lovely.
And it was amazing.

495
00:31:53,225 --> 00:31:57,321
It was lovely and amazing.
I got very lucky with the submarine.

496
00:31:57,429 --> 00:31:58,589
Oh...

497
00:31:58,697 --> 00:32:01,996
Okay, all right, look,
the moment of reckoning.

498
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,831
Lay it on me.
Where would I wear this?

499
00:32:05,937 --> 00:32:07,097
Parent-teacher conference.

500
00:32:08,673 --> 00:32:10,402
Okay.

501
00:32:10,842 --> 00:32:11,536
What about...

502
00:32:13,645 --> 00:32:14,669
...this one?

503
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:18,010
Well, that's for the date that's
never gonna happen, isn't it?

504
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:22,985
Or in case you ever feel like enticing
the spousal unit to do 'ya.

505
00:32:24,155 --> 00:32:25,452
Hey, how about this one?

506
00:32:25,557 --> 00:32:28,924
Well, that's nice.
That's for keeping cozy at your desk.

507
00:32:29,027 --> 00:32:31,359
Cozy at my desk doing what?

508
00:32:31,463 --> 00:32:33,021
I don't know. I'm just here
for the fashion advice.

509
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:36,692
I can't solve your life crisis.

510
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:40,862
I'm gonna go check out
the size 29.

511
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,767
What does it say
about the world

512
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:46,867
when a perfectly attractive woman
like my best friend Sheila

513
00:32:46,978 --> 00:32:52,610
has to resort to wanking off
with her son's bath toy?

514
00:32:52,717 --> 00:32:54,082
Oh...

515
00:32:54,185 --> 00:32:57,279
Even if she is seriously pregnant
at this point,

516
00:32:57,389 --> 00:33:01,291
it somehow seems unjust.

517
00:33:09,301 --> 00:33:13,362
Motherhood is not knowing
what's going to hit you next.

518
00:33:13,471 --> 00:33:17,999
Motherhood is a day in May,
a hot air balloon...

519
00:33:23,748 --> 00:33:27,309
...God's gift to womankind.

520
00:33:58,149 --> 00:34:01,050
What about when
your child's hand is still so small

521
00:34:01,152 --> 00:34:05,452
that he or she puts that hand
in yours with absolute trust?

522
00:34:05,557 --> 00:34:08,253
Their incredibly soft cheeks
when you kiss them.

523
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,590
The way their foreheads sweat
when they're sleeping,

524
00:34:10,695 --> 00:34:12,128
and the hair sticks to it.

525
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:16,860
The hilariously weird things they
say when they're learning to talk.

526
00:34:16,968 --> 00:34:19,732
The way you save their lost teeth
after they fall out,

527
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:21,829
and you've done
your tooth fairy routine,

528
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,737
like some demented Nazi,

529
00:34:23,842 --> 00:34:27,039
because you can't stand
to give up any part of them,

530
00:34:27,145 --> 00:34:29,739
no matter how tiny.

531
00:34:30,448 --> 00:34:32,279
Oh... Sorry I'm late.

532
00:34:32,384 --> 00:34:36,445
Morris needed the final edit
on the Albanian manuscript.

533
00:34:36,554 --> 00:34:39,352
Jesus, you know, I had to pile
through a bunch of extras

534
00:34:39,457 --> 00:34:42,984
with really bad moustaches
just to get to the front door.

535
00:34:43,094 --> 00:34:44,857
Did you notice
that our car got towed?

536
00:34:44,963 --> 00:34:47,158
Yes, I did.
I've been trying to call you.

537
00:34:47,265 --> 00:34:48,892
- Hi!
- Hi.

538
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,264
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

539
00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:53,496
Oh, yeah. Look at that.
Eight missed calls.

540
00:34:53,605 --> 00:34:54,537
Ringer must have been off.

541
00:34:55,273 --> 00:34:58,003
So, uh, did you have something
you needed to tell me?

542
00:34:58,109 --> 00:34:59,940
Nothing that I couldn't
figure out on my own.

543
00:35:00,044 --> 00:35:01,341
You have no idea
how lucky you are

544
00:35:01,446 --> 00:35:03,471
to be married
to a consummate multitasker.

545
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:05,014
Ah, but I do know.

546
00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:12,249
Hey, can you please
take him across the hall?

547
00:35:12,357 --> 00:35:14,518
I need to put in
another half an hour. I just...

548
00:35:14,626 --> 00:35:15,752
I'm just beginning
to get somewhere.

549
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,849
- Oh, really?
- Yep.

550
00:35:16,961 --> 00:35:17,859
Good.

551
00:35:33,278 --> 00:35:36,270
Is that Paul?
I think that's Paul.

552
00:35:36,381 --> 00:35:39,043
Do you see him?

553
00:35:40,418 --> 00:35:41,680
- Did I miss her?
- No, no.

554
00:35:41,786 --> 00:35:45,313
Hi, sweetie! Hi!

555
00:35:46,825 --> 00:35:48,588
See your sister, yeah?

556
00:35:48,693 --> 00:35:49,591
Where is she?

557
00:35:51,129 --> 00:35:53,461
- Oh, there she is.
- Hi!

558
00:35:53,565 --> 00:35:55,897
Hi, Mom! Hi!

559
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,264
Hi, Clara!

560
00:35:58,369 --> 00:36:00,462
- Oh...
- Oh, God!

561
00:36:00,572 --> 00:36:01,971
Clara!

562
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:03,836
Line up, please!

563
00:36:03,942 --> 00:36:05,705
Clara?

564
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,437
Clara?

565
00:36:15,453 --> 00:36:18,911
It's her last day of being 5.

566
00:36:23,728 --> 00:36:26,128
Oh, Avery, Avery, Avery,
Lucas is here.

567
00:36:26,231 --> 00:36:27,255
Didn't you notice?

568
00:36:27,365 --> 00:36:30,357
I put him in front of the Teletubbies.
He'll be paralyzed for an hour.

569
00:36:30,468 --> 00:36:32,732
No, no, no...
I'd love to, but I can't. No!

570
00:36:32,837 --> 00:36:34,998
I have a deadline
and a party to throw, remember?

571
00:36:35,106 --> 00:36:36,596
Yeah.

572
00:36:41,846 --> 00:36:44,212
Av? Can I borrow your bike?

573
00:36:44,315 --> 00:36:44,974
Sure.

574
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:48,382
Oh, can you read my draft?

575
00:36:48,486 --> 00:36:49,919
Can you explain to me
what it is again?

576
00:36:50,021 --> 00:36:51,579
Yes.

577
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:54,487
I'm submitting a piece
to a parenting magazine.

578
00:36:54,592 --> 00:36:57,254
It's a contest.
I mean, it's kind of a real gig.

579
00:36:57,362 --> 00:36:58,886
But I can't get into that right now.

580
00:36:58,997 --> 00:37:01,966
It's only 500 words.
It's a first draft.

581
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:04,830
But, no, I feel like it's solid,
you know?

582
00:37:04,936 --> 00:37:07,871
Something I could put my name to
and feel good about it.

583
00:37:07,972 --> 00:37:09,371
I left a copy on my desk.

584
00:37:09,474 --> 00:37:10,668
Sure.

585
00:37:10,775 --> 00:37:11,742
And, Avery?

586
00:37:11,843 --> 00:37:13,401
Hmm?

587
00:37:13,511 --> 00:37:16,275
Mm... Nothing. It's just...

588
00:37:16,381 --> 00:37:18,178
Be honest.

589
00:37:18,283 --> 00:37:19,614
Bye.

590
00:37:23,321 --> 00:37:23,844
Bye!

591
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:26,947
- Bye.
- Bye.

592
00:38:22,413 --> 00:38:23,675
Shit!

593
00:38:54,245 --> 00:38:56,907
Mama,
I want the big Spider-Man,

594
00:38:57,015 --> 00:38:59,381
not the little Spider-Man.

595
00:38:59,484 --> 00:39:02,078
No, I told you...
It's 39 dollars.

596
00:39:02,186 --> 00:39:04,450
I want the big one!

597
00:39:04,555 --> 00:39:07,353
It's too much money, now, come on!

598
00:39:08,292 --> 00:39:11,125
I told you,
you can't have this, Jorge!

599
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:12,526
Stop it, that's enough.

600
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,120
Come on. Laura?

601
00:39:14,232 --> 00:39:15,961
Laura, get back over here!

602
00:39:16,634 --> 00:39:19,159
Jorge, come on.

603
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:28,743
Laura?
Laura, get back over here.

604
00:40:11,289 --> 00:40:13,120
Yeah, Sheila, got the backpack.

605
00:40:13,224 --> 00:40:15,021
I'm doing my Sherpa routine.

606
00:40:15,126 --> 00:40:16,650
Do you think our children
have any idea

607
00:40:16,761 --> 00:40:17,693
how we suffer on their behalf?

608
00:40:17,795 --> 00:40:18,762
Absolutely not.

609
00:40:18,863 --> 00:40:20,353
Hey, you can't cut the line.

610
00:40:20,465 --> 00:40:21,193
Wait your turn!

611
00:40:21,299 --> 00:40:22,231
Look, I gotta get out of here.

612
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:24,858
I just waited 20 minutes
for some moron to blow up balloons.

613
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:26,163
Well, you can't cut the line.

614
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,966
I've gotta go pick up my twins
from preschool in 10 minutes.

615
00:40:29,073 --> 00:40:31,564
They fine you if you're late.

616
00:40:31,676 --> 00:40:32,335
What the hell is going on?

617
00:40:32,443 --> 00:40:35,003
Crazy, crazy,
now showing everywhere.

618
00:40:35,113 --> 00:40:36,239
Hang on,
I'm just going to get my tea.

619
00:40:36,347 --> 00:40:39,646
Hi, yes.
This is Allison Hopper.

620
00:40:39,751 --> 00:40:42,515
Sorry, I'm just gonna be
a weensy bit late

621
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,589
picking up Sky and Banjo
this afternoon.

622
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,180
Sorry about that.

623
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:53,059
So, Sheila, I'm feeling, why do I
even care if I win this contest?

624
00:40:53,164 --> 00:40:56,224
I mean, I'm addressing such
a narrow sector of the population.

625
00:40:56,334 --> 00:40:57,596
Move up, the line moved.

626
00:40:57,702 --> 00:40:59,693
Not as narrow
as the one you're addressing there.

627
00:40:59,804 --> 00:41:00,862
Where are you?

628
00:41:00,972 --> 00:41:02,462
Getting goody bag stuff.

629
00:41:02,573 --> 00:41:04,768
So much for sticking
to your principles.

630
00:41:04,876 --> 00:41:07,401
"So much for sticking
to your principles."

631
00:41:09,947 --> 00:41:12,347
Some freakazoid is bothering me.

632
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,816
"Freakazoid!"

633
00:41:14,919 --> 00:41:16,216
What the hell is your problem?

634
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,787
What the hell is your problem?

635
00:41:17,889 --> 00:41:20,949
Sheila,
I'm gonna call you back, okay?

636
00:41:21,058 --> 00:41:22,423
No, no, no!

637
00:41:22,527 --> 00:41:26,657
Listen, I wasn't speaking
very loudly in the first place, okay?

638
00:41:26,764 --> 00:41:28,197
I believe in cell phone etiquette.

639
00:41:28,299 --> 00:41:31,166
You introduced your conversation
into my personal space,

640
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:33,965
thus violating any commonly held
definition of "etiquette."

641
00:41:34,071 --> 00:41:34,935
Is that so?

642
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:36,028
Move it! Move up!

643
00:41:36,808 --> 00:41:38,935
Did you know that 90 percent
of cell phone users

644
00:41:39,043 --> 00:41:39,873
believe they're courteous

645
00:41:39,977 --> 00:41:41,706
while 85 percent
of those same users

646
00:41:41,813 --> 00:41:44,145
complain about being annoyed
by others' conversations?

647
00:41:44,248 --> 00:41:46,648
Now, those numbers
really don't add up, do they?

648
00:41:46,751 --> 00:41:48,378
Why don't we have
this conversation in 20 years,

649
00:41:48,486 --> 00:41:50,477
when you've learned a thing or two
about the real world?

650
00:41:50,588 --> 00:41:51,555
Oh, you mean when I'm old?

651
00:41:53,324 --> 00:41:55,849
Even you, my friend,
will turn 40.

652
00:42:00,164 --> 00:42:00,789
You know what?

653
00:42:00,898 --> 00:42:03,526
You urban moms are like
a case study in liberal hypocrisy.

654
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:06,228
You think the rules apply
to other people, but never to you.

655
00:42:06,337 --> 00:42:08,328
You blab your precious banalities
into cell phones,

656
00:42:08,439 --> 00:42:09,406
you buy gluten-free snacks,

657
00:42:09,507 --> 00:42:11,407
yet have no comprehension
of your carbon footprint!

658
00:42:11,509 --> 00:42:14,569
I'd like to shove my carbon footprint
right up your ass.

659
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:17,011
Come on, you're up, you're up!

660
00:42:17,114 --> 00:42:19,708
Can you believe this dickhead?

661
00:42:22,987 --> 00:42:23,578
I'm sorry.

662
00:42:23,688 --> 00:42:25,883
Mommy!
She said "dickhead"!

663
00:43:18,409 --> 00:43:19,808
But that's not her name.

664
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:20,775
Yes, it is.

665
00:43:20,878 --> 00:43:23,142
Says it right here on the order form:
"Clarra."

666
00:43:23,247 --> 00:43:25,681
Her name is "Clara."

667
00:43:25,783 --> 00:43:26,875
Look, see?

668
00:43:26,984 --> 00:43:29,976
"Clara."
Not, "Clar-ra."

669
00:43:30,087 --> 00:43:33,113
Well, our froster
is on a cigarette break, so...

670
00:43:33,224 --> 00:43:34,987
Well, can't someone else fix it?

671
00:43:35,092 --> 00:43:37,993
All you have to do is just
scrape off the "ra", right?

672
00:43:38,095 --> 00:43:40,655
And rewrite it in matching icing
so it doesn't look like an accident.

673
00:43:40,765 --> 00:43:42,357
Only the froster can do that.

674
00:43:42,466 --> 00:43:45,128
Look, I have to go home.
I mean, I have to set up.

675
00:43:45,236 --> 00:43:47,295
So come back.
We're open till midnight.

676
00:43:47,405 --> 00:43:50,101
I can't come back.
The party is at 5:00.

677
00:43:50,207 --> 00:43:51,902
Agh...

678
00:43:52,009 --> 00:43:54,102
You have to admit
it's your own fault.

679
00:43:54,211 --> 00:43:55,735
If you had named her
"Sophie" or "Ella,"

680
00:43:55,846 --> 00:43:59,145
you wouldn't be having this problem,
but you gave her an "Edna" name.

681
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:01,616
- A what?
- You know, an "Edna" name?

682
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:04,449
Like "Mabel" or "Agnes" or "Velma."

683
00:44:04,555 --> 00:44:06,455
Yeah, like lesbian librarian names.

684
00:44:06,557 --> 00:44:08,388
Don't you read
the "Crankypants Post"?

685
00:44:08,492 --> 00:44:11,723
She did a whole thing last week
about names, it was genius.

686
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:14,024
Well, yes, I mean I do read her,

687
00:44:14,131 --> 00:44:17,191
but I like other
parenting blogs better.

688
00:44:17,301 --> 00:44:19,098
What about "The Bjorn Identity"?

689
00:44:19,203 --> 00:44:21,603
That woman is so... I don't know.

690
00:44:21,706 --> 00:44:24,300
I think she's a feminist.

691
00:44:24,408 --> 00:44:26,000
Well, what could be worse than that?

692
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:30,342
Anyway, "Clara"
is not an "Edna" name, right?

693
00:44:30,448 --> 00:44:33,679
Let me guess, you named
her after your favorite grandmother?

694
00:44:33,784 --> 00:44:35,046
Stop.

695
00:45:24,168 --> 00:45:25,533
Oh, excuse me.

696
00:45:25,636 --> 00:45:27,365
Excuse me, I live here.

697
00:45:27,471 --> 00:45:31,407
Oh, do you know if there's
a McKendrick in 6-C?

698
00:45:31,509 --> 00:45:34,569
Yes, I do.
6-C and 6-B.

699
00:45:34,678 --> 00:45:35,235
Try the buzzers?

700
00:45:35,346 --> 00:45:36,005
Yeah.

701
00:45:36,113 --> 00:45:36,909
What?

702
00:45:38,682 --> 00:45:40,547
Oh, no! No!

703
00:45:40,651 --> 00:45:43,484
Avery!

704
00:45:43,587 --> 00:45:44,747
I just...

705
00:45:44,855 --> 00:45:45,981
Classic!

706
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:48,923
How am I gonna get
this shit upstairs?

707
00:45:49,026 --> 00:45:50,357
I was gonna stash it in my car,

708
00:45:50,461 --> 00:45:52,520
which I like to call
my roving metal purse,

709
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:55,155
which was parked right over there,
but then...

710
00:45:56,233 --> 00:46:02,570
Then... this came!
This invasion of the block snatchers!

711
00:46:02,673 --> 00:46:05,767
I've gotta throw a party
for my daughter...

712
00:46:05,876 --> 00:46:07,503
...at 5:00!

713
00:46:07,611 --> 00:46:09,511
I don't know
where my husband has gone.

714
00:46:09,613 --> 00:46:16,109
He has this habit of disappearing
right when I need him the most.

715
00:46:16,353 --> 00:46:18,617
Just, I'll sign for it, okay?

716
00:46:22,693 --> 00:46:24,126
You've got a lot to carry.

717
00:46:45,783 --> 00:46:50,152
So, Mikesh,
you a messenger full-time?

718
00:46:50,254 --> 00:46:52,188
Of course not. No. I write.

719
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:54,250
Don't we all?

720
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:56,883
- Write what?
- Plays. Well, sort of.

721
00:46:56,994 --> 00:47:00,361
I guess you'd call them quietly
domestic plays set in India.

722
00:47:00,464 --> 00:47:01,624
Oh, cool.

723
00:47:01,732 --> 00:47:02,699
Yeah, I tried to find a job

724
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,665
that would occupy
the least amount of mental space

725
00:47:04,768 --> 00:47:06,759
and be so opposite
my true aesthetic intentions

726
00:47:06,871 --> 00:47:08,964
that it wouldn't get in the way,
you know?

727
00:47:09,073 --> 00:47:10,404
Does that work for you?

728
00:47:10,508 --> 00:47:12,271
Most of the time.

729
00:47:12,376 --> 00:47:16,312
How do you do this every day?
I'm winded, man.

730
00:47:16,413 --> 00:47:17,778
Lightweight.

731
00:47:19,617 --> 00:47:22,381
My daughter is a nicotine Nazi.

732
00:47:22,486 --> 00:47:26,479
They do all this anti-smoking
propaganda in school,

733
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:27,852
which is good, I guess,

734
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:32,361
but my position
is everything in moderation,

735
00:47:32,463 --> 00:47:37,298
which is hard to explain to a kid,
you know?

736
00:47:38,802 --> 00:47:40,463
Excuse me one sec.

737
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:41,094
Edith?

738
00:47:42,306 --> 00:47:43,830
You okay in there?

739
00:47:43,941 --> 00:47:45,169
Who is it?

740
00:47:47,978 --> 00:47:49,843
It's me, Eliza.

741
00:47:50,648 --> 00:47:55,051
Got your juice.
Some food for Lady.

742
00:47:56,086 --> 00:47:59,249
Edith, do you need
something to eat?

743
00:47:59,356 --> 00:48:02,018
No, dear.

744
00:48:02,126 --> 00:48:04,060
What day is today?

745
00:48:04,828 --> 00:48:06,989
It's Friday.

746
00:48:07,097 --> 00:48:08,758
It's May 25.

747
00:48:09,366 --> 00:48:10,924
May 25, Edith.

748
00:48:11,035 --> 00:48:13,435
May 25.

749
00:48:13,537 --> 00:48:15,562
Okay, Edith. Gotta go.

750
00:48:15,673 --> 00:48:17,937
Just right next door
if you need me.

751
00:48:18,042 --> 00:48:20,567
I'm right there. Bye.

752
00:48:22,479 --> 00:48:23,605
Wow.

753
00:48:23,714 --> 00:48:26,012
Wow, indeed.

754
00:48:26,116 --> 00:48:27,606
Well...

755
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:33,318
Mikesh, thank you for carrying
all this stuff up for me.

756
00:48:33,424 --> 00:48:35,949
You really saved me.

757
00:48:40,431 --> 00:48:41,193
Oh...

758
00:48:41,298 --> 00:48:43,425
Whew!

759
00:48:43,534 --> 00:48:46,025
I'll take that letter for Avery.

760
00:48:46,136 --> 00:48:47,535
Thank you.

761
00:48:47,638 --> 00:48:49,731
Thank you.

762
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,704
Um...

763
00:48:52,343 --> 00:48:55,642
This was really nice of you.

764
00:48:57,781 --> 00:49:01,114
Um... Do you...?

765
00:49:01,218 --> 00:49:05,018
Well, you must be thirsty.

766
00:49:05,122 --> 00:49:06,612
Do you want a glass of water?

767
00:49:07,891 --> 00:49:08,823
Yeah.

768
00:49:08,926 --> 00:49:10,223
Okay.

769
00:49:10,327 --> 00:49:13,228
- Here, let me get that.
- Oh...

770
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:14,228
You're so kind.

771
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,596
All right.

772
00:49:19,637 --> 00:49:21,764
Sorry for this heinous mess.

773
00:49:21,872 --> 00:49:23,237
Oh, no. I was...

774
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:26,036
The view across your rooftop
is so poetical.

775
00:49:26,143 --> 00:49:27,701
You should see where I live.

776
00:49:27,811 --> 00:49:30,803
Bushwick, man.
It's a little grim.

777
00:49:30,914 --> 00:49:35,112
Well, you're, you're, what,
you're, um... how old?

778
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:36,743
22.

779
00:49:36,854 --> 00:49:40,517
Oh, you can deal
with Bushwick, then.

780
00:49:40,624 --> 00:49:43,422
When you get to be my age...

781
00:49:44,628 --> 00:49:45,560
44.

782
00:49:45,663 --> 00:49:47,494
Wow, well, you look fantastic.

783
00:49:48,999 --> 00:49:52,196
Actually, I'm not quite 44.
I'm, um...

784
00:49:52,303 --> 00:49:53,099
I just lied.

785
00:49:53,203 --> 00:49:55,831
I think I was hoping
that you just might say that.

786
00:49:57,975 --> 00:50:00,239
The point is,
when you get to be my age,

787
00:50:00,344 --> 00:50:02,141
the view becomes less poetical

788
00:50:02,246 --> 00:50:07,206
in relationship to other aspects
of living here.

789
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:08,444
One door on, one door off.

790
00:50:08,552 --> 00:50:10,713
Is this some
kind of artistic statement?

791
00:50:10,821 --> 00:50:11,549
Uh...

792
00:50:11,655 --> 00:50:14,749
This is one of Avery's
renovation projects.

793
00:50:14,858 --> 00:50:18,191
Look closely, and you'll find
similar statements elsewhere.

794
00:50:18,295 --> 00:50:22,129
Like his perennially disorganized
personal library.

795
00:50:22,232 --> 00:50:24,166
He seems interesting,
your husband.

796
00:50:24,268 --> 00:50:27,431
Oh, he is.

797
00:50:27,538 --> 00:50:28,732
He's...

798
00:50:28,839 --> 00:50:32,434
He's eccentric, and I, um...

799
00:50:32,543 --> 00:50:36,639
I fell in love with those
eccentricities, you know?

800
00:50:38,182 --> 00:50:39,809
But then you have kids

801
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:43,080
and try to lead
what's called a grown-up life,

802
00:50:43,187 --> 00:50:47,556
and those sort of things become
obstacles to a sane existence.

803
00:50:47,658 --> 00:50:49,421
So you used to be a writer, too?

804
00:50:52,096 --> 00:50:53,757
Well, this is you, no?

805
00:50:55,899 --> 00:50:58,424
Yes, um...

806
00:50:58,535 --> 00:51:01,163
Or a version of me.
I'd really appreciate it if you...

807
00:51:01,271 --> 00:51:03,205
"She woke up
with the taste of blood in her mouth.

808
00:51:03,307 --> 00:51:06,140
The memory of the night before
hit her full force.

809
00:51:06,243 --> 00:51:07,437
Inexorable.

810
00:51:07,544 --> 00:51:08,943
Swift.

811
00:51:09,046 --> 00:51:11,014
Like fast water moving over rocks...

812
00:51:11,115 --> 00:51:13,276
...she was concerned that...
- Please stop.

813
00:51:16,286 --> 00:51:21,451
Yeah, that was my thing.
That kind of fiercely lyrical fiction.

814
00:51:21,558 --> 00:51:23,617
I got scholarships for it.

815
00:51:23,727 --> 00:51:27,254
I was considered to be
kind of an up-and-comer.

816
00:51:27,364 --> 00:51:29,594
I loved writing.

817
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,361
I still do.

818
00:51:31,468 --> 00:51:39,568
It's just, you know,
when you have kids...

819
00:51:39,676 --> 00:51:42,839
I still write. Sort of.

820
00:51:42,946 --> 00:51:46,313
On more, um... everyday topics.

821
00:51:46,417 --> 00:51:48,408
It's just...

822
00:51:51,955 --> 00:51:54,947
How come you're being
so nice to me?

823
00:51:55,058 --> 00:51:57,356
I saw you go
to that woman next door.

824
00:51:57,461 --> 00:51:59,793
I saw you give her that juice,
very easily.

825
00:51:59,897 --> 00:52:01,888
Very selflessly.

826
00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:04,559
Why can't I be nice, too?

827
00:52:04,668 --> 00:52:07,330
Besides, you're very pretty.

828
00:52:08,972 --> 00:52:09,461
Um...

829
00:52:09,573 --> 00:52:12,542
- Tell me something else.
- About what?

830
00:52:12,643 --> 00:52:14,235
About being a writer.

831
00:52:14,344 --> 00:52:15,709
Oh, well...

832
00:52:15,813 --> 00:52:17,178
Um...

833
00:52:17,281 --> 00:52:21,240
I used to write record reviews
when I was first in college

834
00:52:21,351 --> 00:52:26,345
and after I graduated, for these
little downtown newspapers,

835
00:52:26,457 --> 00:52:31,724
none of which really exist anymore,
to get free albums.

836
00:52:33,363 --> 00:52:35,729
Vinyl!

837
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:38,802
Yeah.

838
00:52:38,902 --> 00:52:43,305
Now I'm really dating myself.

839
00:52:43,407 --> 00:52:45,841
I mean, Avie was really into music.

840
00:52:45,943 --> 00:52:47,205
He turned me on to lots of bands.

841
00:52:47,311 --> 00:52:51,077
I mean, some you've heard of
and probably some you never have.

842
00:52:51,181 --> 00:52:51,840
Like what?

843
00:52:51,949 --> 00:52:55,248
Oh, I don't know.

844
00:52:55,352 --> 00:52:57,252
Play me something.

845
00:52:57,354 --> 00:52:58,912
Oh.

846
00:52:59,022 --> 00:53:00,580
Really?

847
00:53:00,691 --> 00:53:02,488
Yeah.

848
00:53:02,593 --> 00:53:07,030
Um... Okay.

849
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,531
Um...

850
00:53:15,706 --> 00:53:18,607
- You wanna hear something great?
- Yeah.

851
00:53:42,366 --> 00:53:45,665
So spare and basic.
It's Pylon.

852
00:53:47,804 --> 00:53:48,964
Turn it up!

853
00:53:49,072 --> 00:53:49,595
No, no, no.

854
00:53:49,706 --> 00:53:52,140
My downstairs neighbors
have this hideous tool,

855
00:53:52,242 --> 00:53:53,732
and they'll just start
banging on the pipes.

856
00:53:53,844 --> 00:53:55,505
Who cares?

857
00:55:26,003 --> 00:55:26,833
Fantastic!

858
00:55:26,937 --> 00:55:29,098
Yeah.

859
00:55:29,206 --> 00:55:31,106
It's great.

860
00:55:34,311 --> 00:55:36,176
Well...

861
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:41,708
Oh, look, I gotta get things
finished up around here

862
00:55:41,818 --> 00:55:43,445
before my husband gets back.

863
00:55:45,622 --> 00:55:49,217
But you've been a real life-saver.

864
00:55:49,326 --> 00:55:50,293
Yeah?

865
00:55:50,394 --> 00:55:52,521
Absolutely.

866
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:56,390
Well, I'd love to read
your fiction sometime.

867
00:55:57,267 --> 00:55:59,030
Do you have anything more recent?

868
00:55:59,136 --> 00:56:02,697
No, not at the present moment.

869
00:56:02,806 --> 00:56:10,178
No, at the present moment,
my life is... extremely reality-based.

870
00:56:11,815 --> 00:56:15,615
But I do plan to get back to it
at some point.

871
00:56:15,719 --> 00:56:17,744
No, I mean, I will.

872
00:56:17,854 --> 00:56:21,449
As my favorite grad school
professor used to say,

873
00:56:21,558 --> 00:56:30,193
"There is no 'try,'
there is only 'do' and 'do not."'

874
00:56:34,004 --> 00:56:42,708
Well, Mikesh, it's been
incredibly nice to meet you.

875
00:56:57,661 --> 00:56:59,492
Thank you.

876
00:57:36,099 --> 00:57:38,329
I cannot believe you!

877
00:57:38,435 --> 00:57:41,871
What, Sheila? What is it?
What did I do?

878
00:57:41,972 --> 00:57:44,167
Do you have absolutely
no sense of boundaries whatsoever?

879
00:57:44,274 --> 00:57:45,502
What are you talking about?

880
00:57:45,609 --> 00:57:48,976
You used my name!
You used my real name!

881
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:51,877
Everyone who knows us
is now gonna know!

882
00:57:51,982 --> 00:57:52,971
Know what?

883
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:54,710
Do you have any idea
how embarrassing that is?

884
00:57:54,818 --> 00:57:55,477
Where are you?

885
00:57:55,585 --> 00:57:56,517
I'm here!

886
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:59,214
Sheila, Sheila!
Hold on, I'm coming down!

887
00:57:59,322 --> 00:58:01,381
No, don't come down!
Don't fucking bother!

888
00:58:01,491 --> 00:58:03,755
Are you so hard up
for something to say

889
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:04,622
that you have to use

890
00:58:04,728 --> 00:58:06,423
one of your closest friend's
most personal

891
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:08,725
and private experiences

892
00:58:08,832 --> 00:58:11,426
just to make yourself
seem more clever and insightful?

893
00:58:11,535 --> 00:58:14,333
Oh, Christ!
Sheila, I didn't mean to!

894
00:58:14,437 --> 00:58:16,962
Yeah, but you did!
It doesn't matter, Eliza!

895
00:58:17,073 --> 00:58:19,541
Oh, God, I thought
other single moms would relate!

896
00:58:19,643 --> 00:58:23,101
Oh, so wait...
Now I'm your token single mom?

897
00:58:23,213 --> 00:58:25,340
No, no, no.
Other moms, too, okay?

898
00:58:25,448 --> 00:58:27,643
Married moms.
I mean, they can be sympathetic!

899
00:58:27,751 --> 00:58:29,810
Oh, they can feel sorry for me, too.
Well, that's great.

900
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,683
So everybody
can feel sorry for me!

901
00:58:31,788 --> 00:58:33,449
I don't want anyone
to feel sorry for me!

902
00:58:33,557 --> 00:58:34,319
I'm a grown-up!

903
00:58:34,424 --> 00:58:36,051
I made a grown-up choice!

904
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:39,458
And by the way, married women don't
have a whole lot of sex either...

905
00:58:39,563 --> 00:58:40,894
...and you should bloody know!

906
00:58:40,997 --> 00:58:44,592
I just...
I'm coming down! Just hold on!

907
00:58:44,701 --> 00:58:46,794
Don't come down, I'm lea...
I've gotta go and get the kids.

908
00:58:46,903 --> 00:58:47,927
No, Sheila!

909
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:53,041
Sheila, are you still bringing Clara?

910
00:58:53,143 --> 00:58:56,635
Because if you don't, then I've
gotta arrange with Avery and...

911
00:58:56,746 --> 00:58:59,681
Of course I'm still bringing Clara.
What do you think?

912
00:58:59,783 --> 00:59:01,410
Oh, God.

913
00:59:01,518 --> 00:59:05,420
You think I'm gonna punish a child
on her almost birthday

914
00:59:05,522 --> 00:59:07,012
just 'cause her mother's
got a big fucking mouth

915
00:59:07,123 --> 00:59:08,784
and no sense of discretion?

916
00:59:08,892 --> 00:59:13,022
Sheila, just please,
just don't judge me, okay?

917
00:59:13,129 --> 00:59:15,927
I mean, it's not your job.
I'm sorry, okay?

918
00:59:16,032 --> 00:59:18,125
I mean, I'm... I made a mistake!

919
00:59:18,235 --> 00:59:20,999
Yeah, you sure bloody did, babe!

920
01:00:42,419 --> 01:00:44,387
Seriously?

921
01:00:49,025 --> 01:00:50,890
Hey!

922
01:01:27,497 --> 01:01:28,828
Eliz a...

923
01:02:25,155 --> 01:02:26,144
Eliz a?

924
01:02:29,726 --> 01:02:31,193
Eliz a!

925
01:02:44,541 --> 01:02:45,132
What?

926
01:02:45,241 --> 01:02:45,798
What the hell?

927
01:02:45,909 --> 01:02:47,968
Why do you keep
hanging up on me, Eliza?

928
01:02:49,512 --> 01:02:50,274
I'm not Eliza.

929
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:53,816
No, no, this is that woman who only
knows how to be banal, right?

930
01:02:53,917 --> 01:02:55,145
What are you talking about?

931
01:02:55,251 --> 01:02:57,549
If you don't even remember
writing that, Avery,

932
01:02:57,654 --> 01:03:00,919
I'm not only leaving town,
I'm filing for divorce right now.

933
01:03:01,024 --> 01:03:01,956
Leaving town?

934
01:03:02,058 --> 01:03:02,615
Where are you?

935
01:03:02,725 --> 01:03:03,350
I just turned...

936
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:05,792
I'm on... I'm on...

937
01:03:05,895 --> 01:03:07,487
You're breaking...
You're breaking up.

938
01:03:09,099 --> 01:03:11,431
Oh, God! Shit!

939
01:03:11,534 --> 01:03:13,161
I can't hear you.
You're breaking...

940
01:03:13,269 --> 01:03:15,567
There's a cop, Avery!
I don't want a ticket!

941
01:03:15,672 --> 01:03:17,105
We can't afford another ticket!

942
01:03:17,207 --> 01:03:18,139
Okay, I know, I know.

943
01:03:18,241 --> 01:03:20,232
Look, Eliza, you can't leave town.

944
01:03:21,811 --> 01:03:23,369
Too late.

945
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,970
Why are you so upset?

946
01:03:25,081 --> 01:03:27,379
You told me
to be honest about that thing.

947
01:03:27,484 --> 01:03:29,748
Well, there's honest,
and then there's debilitating, Avery.

948
01:03:29,853 --> 01:03:31,684
And apparently
you don't know the difference.

949
01:03:31,788 --> 01:03:33,312
Maybe I don't know the difference.

950
01:03:33,423 --> 01:03:34,651
I mean, just ask Sheila.

951
01:03:34,757 --> 01:03:37,590
Her opinion of me is not much better
than yours at this point.

952
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:39,354
What does Sheila
have to do with this?

953
01:03:39,462 --> 01:03:41,225
Don't even ask.
I have to steer.

954
01:03:41,331 --> 01:03:43,663
You know, you used
to like it when I was tough on you.

955
01:03:43,766 --> 01:03:45,427
You wanted me to do that.

956
01:03:45,535 --> 01:03:48,026
Well, somehow "tough" got
a whole lot less appealing today...

957
01:03:48,138 --> 01:03:50,197
...when I had to run around
absorbing an entire's city worth

958
01:03:50,306 --> 01:03:51,330
of random hostility.

959
01:03:51,441 --> 01:03:53,341
Well, it's not like you don't
radiate your own.

960
01:03:53,443 --> 01:03:55,536
The point is,
I had something to write.

961
01:03:55,645 --> 01:03:57,977
Something important to me,
if not to you.

962
01:03:58,081 --> 01:03:58,570
Yeah?

963
01:03:58,681 --> 01:04:00,581
So why did you go shopping
with your friends?

964
01:04:00,683 --> 01:04:03,311
Because it was the last day
of the sample sale!

965
01:04:03,419 --> 01:04:05,887
And I got a 380-dollar dress
for 40 dollars!

966
01:04:05,989 --> 01:04:07,547
That's why, Avery!

967
01:04:07,657 --> 01:04:10,023
Maybe I should just give it all up
and wear mom jeans.

968
01:04:10,126 --> 01:04:11,991
What the hell are mom jeans?

969
01:04:12,095 --> 01:04:14,359
It's not like you'd notice, anyway.

970
01:04:14,898 --> 01:04:17,458
You wanna know
one of the few benefits of 9/11?

971
01:04:17,567 --> 01:04:19,728
Excellent cell phone reception
in the tunnels.

972
01:04:19,836 --> 01:04:21,269
Okay, Eliz a?

973
01:04:21,371 --> 01:04:23,703
Just stop, okay?
And listen to me.

974
01:04:23,806 --> 01:04:25,000
This isn't funny, really.

975
01:04:25,108 --> 01:04:28,600
What is Clara gonna say when
she gets home and you're not there?

976
01:04:28,711 --> 01:04:29,700
What does she care?

977
01:04:29,812 --> 01:04:32,337
She's got her goody bags
full of plastic crap

978
01:04:32,448 --> 01:04:34,245
I bought against my better judgment.

979
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:36,215
She's got her cake
with the misspelled name...

980
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:38,048
...which I corrected myself.

981
01:04:38,154 --> 01:04:41,214
She's got her purple cups
and plastic forks.

982
01:04:41,324 --> 01:04:42,848
What does she need me for?

983
01:04:42,959 --> 01:04:44,256
Are you serious?

984
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:48,023
I'm not only serious, I'm in Jersey.

985
01:04:48,131 --> 01:04:49,223
You're in wh...?

986
01:04:49,332 --> 01:04:51,197
Hold on, wait.

987
01:04:51,301 --> 01:04:52,097
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- What?

988
01:04:52,202 --> 01:04:53,464
- Oh, my God!
- What?

989
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:55,231
I think he swallowed something.

990
01:04:55,338 --> 01:04:56,396
- Hey, hey!
- Swallowed what?

991
01:04:56,506 --> 01:04:58,633
Avery! Avery, what did he swallow?

992
01:04:58,741 --> 01:05:00,038
I think he's choking!

993
01:05:00,143 --> 01:05:01,440
Avery, don't push your finger
in his throat!

994
01:05:01,544 --> 01:05:03,068
You can stick it down further!

995
01:05:03,179 --> 01:05:04,544
Yeah, right! Well, what do I do?

996
01:05:04,647 --> 01:05:06,740
Yeah, well, we took that class
together, don't you remember?

997
01:05:06,849 --> 01:05:08,510
No, no, I don't remember.
What do l...?

998
01:05:08,618 --> 01:05:11,052
You have to stay calm.
Avery, please, please, just...

999
01:05:11,154 --> 01:05:12,348
Put him over your knee.

1000
01:05:12,455 --> 01:05:13,717
I can't get him
out of the stroller.

1001
01:05:13,823 --> 01:05:16,053
Put him over your knee
and hit him three times on his back!

1002
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:17,387
What do I do now?
I got him on my knee.

1003
01:05:17,493 --> 01:05:20,587
Hit him firmly on the back
three times!

1004
01:05:20,697 --> 01:05:21,254
Okay, hold on.

1005
01:05:21,364 --> 01:05:23,889
Oh, God! Come on!
Just spit it out, all right?

1006
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,228
Avery! I can't hear you!

1007
01:05:25,335 --> 01:05:27,803
Come on! Come on, Lucas!
Spit it out, spit it out!

1008
01:05:27,904 --> 01:05:28,928
Avery?
What are you doing?

1009
01:05:29,038 --> 01:05:30,699
Avery?

1010
01:05:30,807 --> 01:05:33,708
Shit! Shit, shit, shit!

1011
01:05:37,747 --> 01:05:39,908
Oh, Lucas! Lucas, I'm coming!

1012
01:05:40,016 --> 01:05:43,110
Oh, my God! Lucas!
Oh, my God!

1013
01:05:43,219 --> 01:05:43,776
I'm coming!

1014
01:05:43,886 --> 01:05:45,751
Yeah, it's fine. It came out.

1015
01:05:45,855 --> 01:05:48,153
It's fine,
it was just a lollipop in...

1016
01:05:48,258 --> 01:05:49,190
It's all right.

1017
01:06:00,903 --> 01:06:03,303
What could possibly possess you

1018
01:06:03,406 --> 01:06:06,603
to give a toddler
a known choking hazard?

1019
01:06:06,709 --> 01:06:10,702
Don't lecture me, Eliza.
I could just as easily lecture you.

1020
01:06:10,813 --> 01:06:14,146
Really? For what?
For doing all the idiotic errands?

1021
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:17,083
For listening to mothers in the park
who need to be medicated?

1022
01:06:17,186 --> 01:06:19,950
While you get to go to work
with real adults

1023
01:06:20,056 --> 01:06:22,081
and have normal
adult conversation.

1024
01:06:22,725 --> 01:06:24,488
Oh, yeah, like having Morris
ream me out

1025
01:06:24,594 --> 01:06:26,653
because I had to leave work
to take care of Lucas?

1026
01:06:26,763 --> 01:06:29,527
You mean those kind of normal,
adult conversations?

1027
01:06:30,933 --> 01:06:34,494
You got an envelope at home today,
by the way.

1028
01:06:34,604 --> 01:06:36,435
Some messenger guy delivered it.

1029
01:06:37,573 --> 01:06:40,235
Oh, yeah, right.

1030
01:06:41,144 --> 01:06:44,705
He...

1031
01:06:44,814 --> 01:06:47,544
He helped me
carry my bags upstairs,

1032
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:49,948
and so I let him
come in for a while.

1033
01:06:50,053 --> 01:06:50,849
You what?

1034
01:06:50,953 --> 01:06:53,820
I let him come in,
and he blew up balloons.

1035
01:06:56,426 --> 01:06:59,054
You let a messenger
come into our apartment

1036
01:06:59,162 --> 01:07:01,630
and decorate
for our daughter's birthday?

1037
01:07:02,532 --> 01:07:06,400
His name was Mikesh,
and he was just being nice.

1038
01:07:09,605 --> 01:07:12,233
He looked at me
like I was a person

1039
01:07:12,342 --> 01:07:16,210
who might still have something
worthwhile to say.

1040
01:07:17,547 --> 01:07:20,414
I always tell you that you have
something worthwhile to say.

1041
01:07:20,516 --> 01:07:21,608
You...

1042
01:07:21,718 --> 01:07:24,653
You need a stranger
to tell you that?

1043
01:07:24,754 --> 01:07:27,814
Was he good-looking or...?

1044
01:07:31,361 --> 01:07:36,389
He looked at me like I might still
be somebody worth looking at.

1045
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:44,004
How could you not know
that you're worth looking at?

1046
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,781
Were you attracted to him?

1047
01:07:54,784 --> 01:07:58,345
Were you?

1048
01:07:58,454 --> 01:08:04,017
It's just that you never look
at me that way anymore, Avery.

1049
01:08:07,463 --> 01:08:09,021
Do you look at me that way?

1050
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:13,358
No, not really. Not enough.

1051
01:08:20,009 --> 01:08:24,969
But I still love you, Avery.
I really love you, but...

1052
01:08:25,081 --> 01:08:25,843
But what?

1053
01:08:28,985 --> 01:08:31,351
It's just that

1054
01:08:32,488 --> 01:08:38,916
every day from the second I wake up
till the second I pass out cold,

1055
01:08:39,028 --> 01:08:41,861
my day, like the day of almost
every other mother I know,

1056
01:08:41,964 --> 01:08:47,994
is made up of a series of concrete,
specific actions.

1057
01:08:48,805 --> 01:08:51,433
And they're actions that kind of

1058
01:08:51,541 --> 01:08:54,237
wear away at passion,
if you know what I mean.

1059
01:08:56,512 --> 01:08:58,810
The actions
are petty and small like...

1060
01:08:58,915 --> 01:09:04,376
Like refilling coffee cups
or folding underwear.

1061
01:09:04,487 --> 01:09:09,891
But they accumulate
in this really debilitating way

1062
01:09:09,992 --> 01:09:14,053
that diminishes my ability to focus
on almost anything else.

1063
01:09:15,331 --> 01:09:19,927
Bigger things like, you know,
ideas or...

1064
01:09:20,036 --> 01:09:27,101
...politics or dreams
of a better life.

1065
01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:28,939
Well, what would be a better life?

1066
01:09:34,383 --> 01:09:35,907
It wasn't always my ambition

1067
01:09:36,018 --> 01:09:41,979
to supervise a team
of fatuous liberal arts graduates

1068
01:09:42,091 --> 01:09:44,685
and edit their copy about traveling

1069
01:09:44,794 --> 01:09:47,763
to places that we can't afford
to visit.

1070
01:09:49,398 --> 01:09:50,865
When we had Clara,

1071
01:09:50,967 --> 01:09:57,395
I got a job with healthcare
and a little bit of flexibility.

1072
01:09:57,507 --> 01:10:01,876
It was a decision that we made.
We made the decision together.

1073
01:10:02,645 --> 01:10:05,546
So I got a job that I can tolerate.

1074
01:10:05,648 --> 01:10:09,675
No more, no less.

1075
01:10:12,288 --> 01:10:17,089
You're not the only one
who's made sacrifices, Eliza.

1076
01:10:17,193 --> 01:10:20,424
Well, that still doesn't explain
why you can't pick up your socks.

1077
01:10:20,530 --> 01:10:22,464
What do my socks
have to do with it?

1078
01:10:22,565 --> 01:10:25,056
Your socks have everything
to do with it!

1079
01:10:29,205 --> 01:10:35,542
Eliza, all I wanted you
to do in that piece

1080
01:10:35,645 --> 01:10:43,245
was to stop hiding behind irony
because it comes so easily to you.

1081
01:10:45,788 --> 01:10:50,487
I want to know
what you really think.

1082
01:10:50,593 --> 01:10:52,652
I want to know
what you really feel.

1083
01:10:54,630 --> 01:11:01,365
What makes you want to live
a life with passion,

1084
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:05,634
no matter how many socks
you have to pick up.

1085
01:11:09,879 --> 01:11:10,846
What about that?

1086
01:11:39,408 --> 01:11:40,568
Come on, Coupon.

1087
01:11:40,676 --> 01:11:43,076
Come on, get out.

1088
01:11:43,179 --> 01:11:44,612
Oh...

1089
01:11:44,714 --> 01:11:46,341
Does Coupon have to be out here?

1090
01:11:46,449 --> 01:11:50,852
Ah, no, but Bodhi
just tripped over him.

1091
01:11:50,953 --> 01:11:53,285
Oh, is that Bodhi crying?

1092
01:11:53,389 --> 01:11:54,788
Yeah, it is.

1093
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:56,824
Is Lily crying back in his face?

1094
01:11:56,926 --> 01:11:59,326
Unfortunately, yes.

1095
01:12:00,396 --> 01:12:02,057
Oh...

1096
01:12:02,164 --> 01:12:04,155
Did Sheila come back?

1097
01:12:04,266 --> 01:12:05,426
Not yet.

1098
01:12:06,936 --> 01:12:08,927
Don't worry.

1099
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,366
You were right, you know?

1100
01:12:12,475 --> 01:12:13,942
Unbelievable.

1101
01:12:14,043 --> 01:12:15,010
About what?

1102
01:12:16,112 --> 01:12:17,670
About this.

1103
01:12:18,414 --> 01:12:20,143
But I think I figured it out.

1104
01:12:20,249 --> 01:12:21,409
I just need a little more time to...

1105
01:12:21,517 --> 01:12:23,417
A couple more minutes,
and I'll be done.

1106
01:12:26,122 --> 01:12:28,647
Everything's under control in here.

1107
01:12:35,598 --> 01:12:39,967
Okay, and...

1108
01:12:41,037 --> 01:12:43,437
Mom, everybody wants cake now.

1109
01:12:43,539 --> 01:12:44,870
And there has to be
six purple candles

1110
01:12:44,974 --> 01:12:46,771
and one number six candle.

1111
01:12:46,876 --> 01:12:49,436
Okay.

1112
01:12:49,845 --> 01:12:50,368
Come here.

1113
01:12:52,481 --> 01:12:53,175
What are you writing?

1114
01:12:53,282 --> 01:12:54,180
Ooh!

1115
01:12:54,283 --> 01:12:56,183
Oh...

1116
01:12:56,285 --> 01:12:58,116
Just this thing.

1117
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:01,383
It has to be done by midnight.
It's kind of important.

1118
01:13:01,490 --> 01:13:04,254
It means mommy
might get a real job.

1119
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,851
But I don't want you
to get a real job.

1120
01:13:06,962 --> 01:13:10,295
Why not?
It's good when mommies work.

1121
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:11,889
It keeps mommies happy.

1122
01:13:12,001 --> 01:13:15,835
It keeps them from being mean,
nasty, yelling mommies.

1123
01:13:15,938 --> 01:13:19,305
What about daddies?
Should daddies not work, too?

1124
01:13:19,408 --> 01:13:22,002
Why moms and not dads, hmm?

1125
01:13:22,111 --> 01:13:23,669
Enlighten me.

1126
01:13:23,779 --> 01:13:28,307
'Cause moms do everything.
Dads only do some things.

1127
01:13:28,417 --> 01:13:29,509
It's different.

1128
01:13:30,286 --> 01:13:31,981
Oh, hi, Lady.

1129
01:13:36,258 --> 01:13:39,022
Mom, for my seventh birthday,
can I get a cat?

1130
01:13:39,128 --> 01:13:40,527
Mm...

1131
01:13:40,629 --> 01:13:41,926
Mom, can I?

1132
01:13:42,031 --> 01:13:46,161
Lady? Lady, where are you?

1133
01:13:46,268 --> 01:13:47,098
Mom?

1134
01:13:47,203 --> 01:13:51,799
"Maybe" is the best I can do, okay?

1135
01:13:51,974 --> 01:13:55,637
No peeking!

1136
01:13:57,413 --> 01:13:59,677
Here it comes!

1137
01:14:30,579 --> 01:14:32,308
Are ya 1?

1138
01:14:32,414 --> 01:14:33,574
Are ya 2?

1139
01:14:33,682 --> 01:14:35,115
Are ya 3?

1140
01:14:35,217 --> 01:14:37,048
Are ya 4?

1141
01:14:37,153 --> 01:14:38,484
Are ya 5?

1142
01:14:38,587 --> 01:14:40,680
Noooooooo!

1143
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:42,519
You're 6!

1144
01:14:42,625 --> 01:14:44,320
You're 6!

1145
01:15:03,612 --> 01:15:05,273
Squeeze her again!

1146
01:15:09,718 --> 01:15:14,121
Oh, come on, you moron!
It's not even 7:00!

1147
01:15:14,223 --> 01:15:17,249
It's a little girl's birthday party!

1148
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:21,955
Clara, Clara,
can you turn it down just a little?

1149
01:15:23,532 --> 01:15:26,558
The parties we used to have
in this building, dear.

1150
01:15:26,669 --> 01:15:28,534
I can't tell you.

1151
01:15:28,637 --> 01:15:34,234
Everyone would drink gin
and smoke reefer

1152
01:15:34,343 --> 01:15:39,975
and dance and talk until dawn.

1153
01:15:40,082 --> 01:15:42,050
We used to argue a lot, too.

1154
01:15:42,151 --> 01:15:44,517
This was a very political crowd,

1155
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:49,455
very serious about their positions,
don't you know.

1156
01:15:49,558 --> 01:15:53,358
No one would have dreamed
of complaining then.

1157
01:15:57,766 --> 01:15:59,859
Clara, crank it up!

1158
01:16:00,736 --> 01:16:02,260
Come on, everybody, let's jump!

1159
01:16:02,371 --> 01:16:05,135
Jump as hard as you can!
Jump up and down!

1160
01:16:05,241 --> 01:16:06,868
Jump, jump, jump!

1161
01:16:09,211 --> 01:16:10,803
Come on, everybody, let's go!

1162
01:16:21,357 --> 01:16:23,018
So your party's a big success.

1163
01:16:26,228 --> 01:16:29,959
Well, until someone starts bleeding,
I'd have to agree.

1164
01:16:32,701 --> 01:16:35,101
Sheila, I just...

1165
01:16:38,007 --> 01:16:40,567
I am so incredibly sorry
I hurt you.

1166
01:16:42,478 --> 01:16:45,641
Look, I do remember
uttering the distinct phrase,

1167
01:16:45,748 --> 01:16:47,238
"This does not leave this room."

1168
01:16:48,951 --> 01:16:52,580
And by that I meant, "Do not use
this episode for your own ends."

1169
01:16:57,126 --> 01:16:58,753
Be that as it may,

1170
01:16:58,861 --> 01:17:00,328
we always promised
that we'd tell each other

1171
01:17:00,429 --> 01:17:04,024
the minute we got pissed off,
and that's just what I did.

1172
01:17:06,201 --> 01:17:08,897
All right, steady on, steady on.
Hair on the lip gloss.

1173
01:17:09,004 --> 01:17:10,972
I was just telling you
when I was pissed off

1174
01:17:11,073 --> 01:17:13,166
when it actually happened.

1175
01:17:13,275 --> 01:17:15,243
I know.

1176
01:17:15,344 --> 01:17:19,246
You were just so funny about it,
you know?

1177
01:17:19,348 --> 01:17:21,509
I just...

1178
01:17:21,617 --> 01:17:23,084
I didn't think.

1179
01:17:23,185 --> 01:17:27,588
Oh, but you always
have to think, Eliza.

1180
01:17:27,690 --> 01:17:30,420
Oh, bloody hell.

1181
01:17:30,526 --> 01:17:32,585
My midwife told me
if I carry on eating sugar

1182
01:17:32,695 --> 01:17:33,855
all through my third trimester,

1183
01:17:33,963 --> 01:17:37,455
I'm gonna give birth
to a 10-pound behemoth, maybe 12.

1184
01:17:37,566 --> 01:17:40,729
That would be extremely
uncomfortable to push out vaginally.

1185
01:17:40,836 --> 01:17:42,360
Don't say "vaginally."

1186
01:17:54,917 --> 01:18:00,617
You did a stupendous job
pulling everything together today.

1187
01:18:00,723 --> 01:18:03,317
I did, didn't I?

1188
01:18:04,927 --> 01:18:06,326
I hope you don't mind,

1189
01:18:06,428 --> 01:18:10,023
'cause I know how you feel
about these things, but...

1190
01:18:10,132 --> 01:18:15,126
I did get Clara the purple
iPod shuffle that she wanted.

1191
01:18:15,237 --> 01:18:17,398
You did?

1192
01:18:17,506 --> 01:18:20,634
That's kind of an expensive
present for a 6-year-old.

1193
01:18:20,743 --> 01:18:24,679
I mean, it's not really
in our economy, is it?

1194
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:26,441
It's in our economy today.

1195
01:18:28,584 --> 01:18:31,280
The envelope,
came with the messenger.

1196
01:18:31,387 --> 01:18:34,322
Your friend, Mikesh?

1197
01:18:35,924 --> 01:18:37,448
You didn't open it, did you?

1198
01:18:38,527 --> 01:18:40,825
It was addressed to you.

1199
01:18:56,879 --> 01:19:00,212
This is a check
for 24,000 dollars, Avery.

1200
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:06,185
What did you do?

1201
01:19:08,957 --> 01:19:11,084
You know those books
that were being thrown out today?

1202
01:19:13,128 --> 01:19:17,724
One of them happened to be
a copy of Emerson's essays.

1203
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:23,100
A first edition, which as you know,
is incredibly rare.

1204
01:19:23,205 --> 01:19:27,642
And this first edition also happened
to be inscribed,

1205
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:29,973
which significantly upped the value,

1206
01:19:30,079 --> 01:19:35,073
so I took it to Odyssey,
and I sold it.

1207
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:39,451
But you love Emerson.

1208
01:19:39,555 --> 01:19:41,580
You love that book!

1209
01:19:42,791 --> 01:19:44,486
You didn't want to keep it?

1210
01:19:44,593 --> 01:19:47,562
Yeah, of course I wanted to keep it.

1211
01:19:49,264 --> 01:19:51,664
I even had a messenger
over the check.

1212
01:19:51,767 --> 01:19:54,861
Seemed kinda classy.

1213
01:19:57,506 --> 01:20:02,944
I figured it's probably enough
to pay for Lucas' preschool

1214
01:20:03,045 --> 01:20:04,239
for a couple of years.

1215
01:20:06,181 --> 01:20:08,979
And maybe even a dishwasher.

1216
01:20:09,918 --> 01:20:14,855
Because I want you
to take some time and write.

1217
01:20:15,557 --> 01:20:22,087
Your "mom-oir," whatever the hell
you call it, or something else.

1218
01:20:22,464 --> 01:20:31,668
This is...
This is for you, because you...

1219
01:20:37,913 --> 01:20:39,175
Oh, Avery!

1220
01:21:07,709 --> 01:21:11,440
Wait, put this somewhere safe.

1221
01:21:11,547 --> 01:21:14,277
I'll do it.

1222
01:21:26,128 --> 01:21:30,462
Motherhood is about accepting
the limitations of time and energy,

1223
01:21:30,566 --> 01:21:32,158
which stretch beyond you,

1224
01:21:32,267 --> 01:21:35,634
even if sometimes it feels
they could consume you.

1225
01:21:35,737 --> 01:21:39,833
Search for and hold on
to your own true self.

1226
01:21:39,942 --> 01:21:43,002
If you lose that,
what kind of mother can you be?

1227
01:21:44,012 --> 01:21:45,445
Things are always changing,

1228
01:21:45,547 --> 01:21:50,143
no matter how much we might
want things to stay the same.

1229
01:21:50,252 --> 01:21:52,516
You could take a picture
of your kids every single day,

1230
01:21:52,621 --> 01:21:57,490
and every single day,
they'd just be getting older.

1231
01:21:58,293 --> 01:21:59,851
That's a fact.

1232
01:21:59,962 --> 01:22:02,522
A heartbreaking fact.

1233
01:22:02,631 --> 01:22:04,531
But still a fact.

1234
01:22:04,633 --> 01:22:08,399
So seize your days
and dwell in them fully.

1235
01:22:08,503 --> 01:22:09,595
Look to your children

1236
01:22:09,705 --> 01:22:12,333
because they know how to inhabit
brief periods of time

1237
01:22:12,441 --> 01:22:14,875
with extreme passion.

1238
01:22:14,977 --> 01:22:19,277
And for nothing more, really,
than the sake of those moments.

1239
01:22:19,381 --> 01:22:25,081
They can help you remember that,
if you only slow down and let them.

1240
01:22:30,225 --> 01:22:36,596
Feel fortunate because chances
are good you actually might be.

1241
01:22:45,007 --> 01:22:48,033
Mommy, mommy, mommy,
it's raining outside! Come quick!

1242
01:22:49,111 --> 01:22:50,874
All right.

1243
01:22:53,515 --> 01:22:55,380
Come on!

1244
01:22:56,285 --> 01:23:00,016
- It's raining outside!
- It is?

1245
01:23:00,122 --> 01:23:01,783
- It's raining!
- Wow!

1246
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:04,620
Lucas, go get daddy!
Go get daddy!

1247
01:23:04,726 --> 01:23:08,423
Here, sweetie, come on.

1248
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:11,988
It's special movie rain...
for your birthday.

1249
01:23:15,704 --> 01:23:16,830
Wow!

1250
01:23:17,539 --> 01:23:22,533
Whoa!
Oh, my God, it's piss!

1251
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:24,646
Come out of here!

1252
01:23:24,746 --> 01:23:27,613
Don't say I didn't warn ya!

1253
01:23:27,716 --> 01:23:28,580
Go, Hester!

1254
01:23:28,684 --> 01:23:30,208
Sound speed!

1255
01:23:30,319 --> 01:23:31,251
Speeding.

1256
01:23:31,353 --> 01:23:32,980
And, action!

1257
01:23:35,457 --> 01:23:36,788
Come here!

1258
01:23:36,892 --> 01:23:39,918
Whoa!

1259
01:23:40,028 --> 01:23:41,552
Look at the movie down there!

1260
01:23:41,663 --> 01:23:43,358
Can you see it?

1261
01:23:43,465 --> 01:23:46,127
I'm soaked!
