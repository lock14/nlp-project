1
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,120
Morosgoványi!
-Yes, Lieutenant!

2
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,880
What day is it today, Morosgoványi?

3
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,040
Saturday, Lieutenant.

4
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,160
Second Saturday.

5
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,600
Bathing Saturday, Lieutenant.

6
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,520
What are the duties of an orderly
on a bathing Saturday, Morosgoványi?

7
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,840
I humbly report, he is obliged
to set up the trough

8
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,200
that serves as a bath tub,
in the kitchen

9
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,480
that is appropriately heated
and propped up

10
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,800
at four... six points,

11
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,200
then to fill it up with water
that has been boiled

12
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,200
to the correct temperature
from the pot outside,

13
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,600
according to demand and person.

14
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,080
And what makes the water boil,
Morosgoványi?

15
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,120
I humbly report,
the fire does and this has to be...

16
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,200
laid in the fireplace outside
in east-south-

17
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,680
easterly direction...

18
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,440
This is after?

19
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,920
After the wood has been chopped
to the correct size.

20
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,320
The correct size is?

21
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,560
Twenty, five, five...

22
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,680
Centimetres.

23
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,120
This is after...?

24
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,560
After the Lieutenant's
been accompanied out...

25
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,920
After...?

26
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,280
After the bicycle tires
have been pumped...

27
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,880
After...?
-After the toilet's been scrubbed...

28
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,960
After...?
-The muck's been carried out...

29
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,120
After...?
-The straw's been carried in...

30
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,520
The other way around, Morosgovány,
the other way around.

31
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,840
Yes, the other way around!

32
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,480
This is after...?

33
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,000
The Lieutenant's buttons
have been polished. -After...?

34
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,960
The daily field exercise
has been completed.

35
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,920
After...?

36
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,600
After the pig has been fed.

37
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,240
Quite right.

38
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,200
And?

39
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,960
What is it that the orderly never does,
Morosgoványi?

40
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,880
I humbly report, under no
circumstances does he peep.

41
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,840
Because if he peeps?

42
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,880
His big mouth will be shot off!
-His harelip! Morosgoványi.

43
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,440
Yes indeed, Lieutenant!

44
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,680
Hang on... hang on!

45
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,160
Too much, too much, too much!

46
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,880
Hang on! Hang on!

47
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,720
Just a drop more...

48
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,240
Good, good. Too much, too much!

49
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,560
Now, get out!

50
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,760
Don't you have
anything better to do? Get out!

51
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,320
And what are you smiling at?

52
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,440
What's true is true.

53
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,920
The poet was right.

54
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,120
For what, I ask,
does a man's dick stand erect?

55
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,080
Who knows that?

56
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,160
Don't you think, Morosgoványi?
-Yes, Lieutenant.

57
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,520
And so I ask you straight,
Morosgoványi...

58
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,640
is there anything better
than the cunt of a woman?

59
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,960
Because you can call it
what you like...

60
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,680
...the cunt is still the common
denominator...

61
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,360
Isn't it?

62
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,280
And if it's not,

63
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,880
it's because it's not,

64
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,880
or because it's ugly...

65
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,840
I mean the word...

66
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,880
or unwashed, I mean.

67
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,240
Or like a pig.
-Yes, Lieutenant.

68
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,000
For, I quite agree

69
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,080
that a poet's description
of a love chalice

70
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,600
is more beautiful...

71
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,520
Or a dewy lilly.

72
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,200
Or perhaps a pussy...

73
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,320
No doubt about that.

74
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,360
Or in the words of the song.
How does it go?

75
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:41,840
<i>If you were a rosebud, a rosebud,
I would be a bee.</i>

76
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,040
<i>I'd buzz up to you...</i>

77
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,520
But that's just how they say it.

78
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,640
When courting or being polite.

79
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:03,320
Because all they are
really saying is "cunt".

80
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,200
Do you understand?

81
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,560
The cunt, yes!

82
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,000
Because, listen, Vendel...

83
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,200
I've got my own theory

84
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,520
that it's not the world
that makes cunt go around,

85
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,360
but it's cunt that makes
the world go around...

86
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,480
Erno, lunch is ready!

87
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,000
What are you going on about?
Go and find something to do!

88
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,080
Leona! Now! I've had enough!

89
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,480
Not now! You're it!

90
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,760
Leona, come on, run, Leona!

91
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,400
Come on, come on, throw it then!

92
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,200
Girls!

93
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,840
Bedtime!

94
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,880
Girls!

95
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,200
Into bed, one, two.

96
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,160
Miss!

97
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,640
Sleep well.

98
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,400
Don't worry about your figure,

99
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,200
just grow nice and fat for me.

100
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,200
Sweet dreams!

101
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:52,680
<i>There is a poor, orphan girl...</i>

102
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:02,600
<i>She doesn't have a mother or father
to love her.</i>

103
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,840
<i>She has a friend, loneliness</i>

104
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,640
<i>and she washes clothes in the stream</i>

105
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,480
<i>morning and night</i>

106
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,960
<i>Her stepmother shouts at her
and beats her</i>

107
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:37,520
<i>Poor orphan, her life is miserable.</i>

108
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:50,880
<i>The little girl washes a white dress
in the little stream.</i>

109
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,920
HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN:
THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL

110
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,400
Don't be afraid of me.

111
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,960
But you're trembling.

112
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,480
Shall I magic
stars for you in the sky?

113
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,560
Yes.

114
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,640
Would you like that?
-Yes.

115
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,880
You really want me to?

116
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,480
Yes.
-Millions of tiny stars...

117
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,240
But you have to help me.

118
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,600
Give me your hand.

119
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,680
Yes, there.

120
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,640
I'm flying!

121
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,400
Here you are! My dear Leona!

122
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,880
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

123
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,080
To the final victory!

124
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,520
Cheers! Cheers!

125
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,400
Hey, where are you?

126
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,800
Here, Morosgoványi.
The candle supply.

127
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,160
Morosgoványi!

128
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,600
But won't you get cold, Mistress,
out of bed like this?

129
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,720
That only depends on you,
Vendel,

130
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,000
on how skilful you are.

131
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,320
Scratch me, Morosgoványi,

132
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,760
scratch me!

133
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:23,960
Keep scratching.

134
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,840
Are you undressing me, silly boy?

135
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,800
It's winter...

136
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,600
A woman can't afford to catch
a chill with her equipment,

137
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,920
you know, Morosgoványi. A woman
needs a lot of warmth, a lot.

138
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,760
Oh, yes. You.

139
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,720
Wait, I 'm going to throw
my guts up, hey.

140
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,640
I'm going to fuck you, Irma.

141
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,480
Can I say things like that?

142
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,400
Sure I can, damn it!

143
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,000
Fuck my cunt,
shove your prick right up.

144
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,520
Fuck my cunt,
shove your prick right up.

145
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,880
My little mangalica piggy.

146
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,120
My little mangalica,

147
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,480
my little pig,

148
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,120
my sow,

149
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,880
my piggy!

150
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,480
Tell me, Ferike, Leona,

151
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,200
Vilma.
Tell me, Irmuska, you, you, you!

152
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,960
Let's shriek together.

153
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,680
And let's laugh and

154
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:19,160
let's grunt,
because life's too short.

155
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,960
And get it in,

156
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,040
get it in,

157
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,680
get it in!

158
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,800
As hard as you can!

159
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,760
Morosgoványi...

160
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,760
Yes, Lieutenant!

161
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,360
Little Kálmán, my little son!

162
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,480
...and now, at this very moment,

163
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,600
if we can believe the scales,
and why shouldn't we?

164
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,800
Our boy Kálmán Balatony
is moving into second place

165
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,360
behind Hristo Mehmedov

166
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,400
who's in position 2, so he's
only behind by a fraction

167
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,960
Ivan Duharin,
Soviet world champion...

168
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,480
Come on, come on!
You've got second!

169
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,440
...then Béla Miszlényi,
in a phenomenal fourth place!

170
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,160
The contender from of the 12th Regiment
of the Bulgarian Liberation Front

171
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,840
is keeping up
with the two Hungarians.

172
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,520
It's still impossible to tell
what the final result will be.

173
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,320
We know, who the winner will be,
but there is an incredible chase

174
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,360
for the second, third
and fourth place!

175
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,600
Colonel Ivan Duharin,
is now in first place,

176
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,080
followed by Kálmán Balatony
in the colours of Honvéd.

177
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,120
Come on Kálmán, come on Honvéd!
Then Hristo Mehmedov,

178
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,720
followed by Béla Miszlényi.
After him...

179
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,920
Come on Hungarians,

180
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,040
come on Hungarians!

181
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,080
Come on Balatony!

182
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,320
Come on Miszlényi!

183
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,160
Come on Hungarians,
come on Hungarians!

184
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,760
Will Balatony be able to keep
his very shaky second place?

185
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,760
Of course he will,
58 seconds to go,

186
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,840
he's putting on an amazing finish.

187
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,720
And so is Miszlényi.

188
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,760
Miszlényi is third,
Balatony is 0.2 behind Duharin...

189
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,880
Only 0.1! Is he...?
No, he isn't.

190
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,440
You like her, don't you?

191
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,040
Leave her alone!

192
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,040
You kept looking at her.
-I'm second all the same.

193
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,120
Because I pushed you.

194
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,360
Ah, Chick!

195
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,480
This competition
is more important than that.

196
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,000
This woman is going to be my wife.

197
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,800
Are you crazy?
You don't even know her.

198
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,120
What the fuck are you looking at
all the time?

199
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,320
You know where you are, Chick? No?

200
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,400
Then look out there to see
where you're standing.

201
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,440
At a turning point.
And you still fuck it up?

202
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,080
Is it worth anything to you
if you're second? Norway!

203
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,640
Are you crazy?
-I'm second. -But how?

204
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,720
By a thread. Shut your face.

205
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,520
Just stare into your plate and eat!
It's not soup anymore.

206
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,880
You eat some false tooth or ring
or something and that's it.

207
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,880
Do I make myself clear?
-Yes.

208
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,800
I should think so.

209
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,320
Now, the lipid.
It's dry, dangerous

210
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,880
and full of shit like
gauze and wadding.

211
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,360
Only a little lubricant,
enough for three regurgitations.

212
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,800
Do I make myself clear?

213
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,960
Béla.

214
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,800
Béla, you keep up with Kálmán.
And keep an eye on the Russian!

215
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,800
It's good for you, too.
The Soviet's first and we're second.

216
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,800
Go, Honvéd! Go Hungarians!

217
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,680
The Vasilyev move worked and
the Garmeyer cross-swallow.

218
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,840
I don't know what his problem is.

219
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,280
The Garmeyer cross-swallow?
With bean soup?

220
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,400
You didn't even notice, did you?

221
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,200
And why not? Because the pacemaker
was watching the woman too!

222
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,080
I'm telling you,
you can be only third,

223
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,680
and only the champion
can take the women's champion.

224
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,920
All right. The champion
gets the women's champion!

225
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,120
Welcome to the Spartakiad.
We welcome

226
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,520
Comrade Gizella Aczél who competes
for the canning factory and

227
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,000
won the Junior World Championship
in Cuba in "sausage and beans".

228
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,200
And another international champion
in sport eating:

229
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,800
Comrade Bat Bulgana from Mongolia

230
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,640
who took gold in Beijing
in "hard-boiled eggs".

231
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,760
To your plates,

232
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,880
get set,

233
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,240
go!

234
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,120
And the fight has started
in the second course.

235
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,040
The two Hungarians are right
behind the Spartacus star.

236
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,960
The stakes are high
in the second round

237
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,600
with horse sausage chosen by
the Soviets, who knows?

238
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,560
Go Hungarians!

239
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,880
Tempo! You're first, come on!
Let's go! Come on!

240
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,800
And I can't believe my eyes.

241
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,440
Balatony's scales are showing 23.5,

242
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,800
no, 23.7 less than Duharin's.

243
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,600
Yes, Balatony is winning!
A historic moment!

244
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,720
It's good to be Hungarian
in Kecskemét.

245
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,360
A milestone in Hungarian sport eating!

246
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,120
Come on Balatony!
Come on Miszlényi!

247
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,720
Come on Balatony!

248
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,800
The spoon, the spoon!

249
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,120
...they keep on eating
but Kálmán's stopped.

250
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,080
It looks like lockjaw!
The others just keep on going

251
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,600
as the clock eats up the last
few seconds. But Balatony! Kálmán!

252
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,720
Comrade! What are you doing?
You can still win. Come on!

253
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,600
Oh, there seems to be a problem...
It is lockjaw, I'm afraid.

254
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,400
Let me tell you,
Cuba is a Socialist paradise.

255
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,000
And there are oranges everywhere.

256
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,080
You don't have to queue,
they just drop from the trees.

257
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,280
Hello, hello.

258
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,920
How are you, son, how are you?
You're getting your colour back...

259
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,960
Hello, you cheat!

260
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,360
Tinned strawberries.

261
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,920
Your favourite.

262
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,080
Béla Miszlényi.
-Gizella Aczél. Congratulations.

263
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,320
I've heard so much about you,
Comrade Aczél.

264
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,720
I respect your results. If you
have results, you have everything.

265
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,000
Béla came second, after Duharin.

266
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,160
And this has its own consequences.

267
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,280
I hear, it's Norway.

268
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,600
Norway. They'll put me forward
for the European championship.

269
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,840
The most important thing is
that you're in one piece.

270
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,200
I can tell you this,
as one champion to another.

271
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,680
Isn't that right, Kálmán?

272
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,120
I brought some bananas.
Good and soft.

273
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,920
Nice.

274
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,240
Do you want some, Comrade?
-No thanks.

275
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,640
Are you not coming, Comrade?

276
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,920
My car's outside, I can give you
a lift if you like.

277
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,000
Or you want to chat, Kalmán?

278
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,800
All right, my boy.
Don't let yourself go!

279
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,080
So then, good bye, Kálman.

280
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,120
Get well soon.

281
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,280
Bride for sale!

282
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,280
Faster, gentlemen, faster!

283
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,840
Come on, don't be mean!

284
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,120
Smile, Matyi, it's a wedding,
not a funeral!

285
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,120
Bride for sale!

286
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,480
Faster, Matyi, faster!

287
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,120
Have you grown roots or what!

288
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,480
Thank you, Juliska!

289
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,760
Laci, my old mate,
put the money in here.

290
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,680
Hey, don't take it out, put it in!

291
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,240
Bride for sale!

292
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,960
Let's run away!

293
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,520
Sure.

294
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,320
The bride's running away!

295
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,200
Béla?
-Béla.

296
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,960
That fucking liar!

297
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,680
Where is he?
-Not so fast.

298
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,040
It must be worked for, my boy.

299
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,680
First test: singing.

300
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,440
No you don't.

301
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,120
Norway.

302
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,600
Come with me.

303
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,520
I want you, Gizi.

304
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,960
I want to spend my life with you.

305
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,040
I love you, Gizi.

306
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:07,040
<i>It cannot be the time for farewell,</i>

307
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:15,240
<i>I only had you, no one else.</i>

308
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,560
<i>You took my dreams,</i>

309
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,560
<i>I still see your face.</i>

310
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:30,280
<i>A painful thought is haunting me:</i>

311
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:38,280
<i>Will you think of me,
when the night is over?</i>

312
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,240
<i>All our dreams are torn...</i>

313
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,560
We can go to Norway, Gizi!

314
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,520
Gizi! You're mine, Gizi!

315
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,440
I won you, Gizi!

316
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,400
Norway!

317
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:03,520
<i>And you have never loved
anyone like me.</i>

318
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:12,200
<i>Will you think of me,
when the night is over...</i>

319
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:19,960
<i>Don't tear all our dreams apart.</i>

320
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,280
<i>Lie that it hurts,
that it still hurts.</i>

321
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,920
Pista, Józsi, move!

322
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,200
Pali, don't just sit there!
Get to the machine!

323
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,240
Just how are you holding that hose?

324
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,080
Excuse me.

325
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,400
Good afternoon.
Comrade Szakacs said...

326
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,880
It's arranged.

327
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,040
Sit over there.

328
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,000
Menu: dessert, semolina pudding.

329
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,600
You get cocoa powder on it.

330
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,040
Sit up!

331
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,480
Spoons up.

332
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,360
You too!

333
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,920
Your spoon?

334
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,840
Marks, get set, go!

335
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,560
Semolina, mushy,

336
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,640
lumpy.

337
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,800
Don't forget to work your elbows.
Go for the cross-swallow.

338
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,960
Come on, ten seconds left.

339
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,160
Finished!

340
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,400
Oh, I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.

341
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,080
Kiril Gottman.

342
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,720
Kzystof Dihar.

343
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,960
Jan Beher Kekes.

344
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,400
Béla Miszlényi.

345
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,080
I can't!

346
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,200
This is a totally different world.

347
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,320
It needs a different personality.

348
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,960
Listen to this, listen to that!
Do it like this, then like that!

349
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,800
Then the Bulgarians and
Soviets take everything.

350
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,280
And Béla Miszlényi.
-I don't give a shit about him!

351
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,080
They gave him everything.

352
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,040
"Mister Miszlényi, please".

353
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,680
Throat expansion.

354
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,080
Where are we compared to them,

355
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,920
Chick?

356
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,120
Do you remember, Uncle Jeno?

357
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,440
With the Inota chocolate bar,

358
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,960
at the fluid stage, to be precise,

359
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,320
it was neither shaped nor cut.
Still hot.

360
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,720
I was in the sixth grade, I think.

361
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,160
The man in the factory told us
we could eat as much as we wanted

362
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,920
but not to put any
into our pockets or bags.

363
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,200
There was a girl, Ibolya,

364
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,480
I wanted to impress her.

365
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,800
I wanted to show that I was
good at something and

366
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
there are other things than
climbing a rope or singing.

367
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,760
"Can you give me a spoon
and soda", I asked.

368
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,440
I just counted to myself.

369
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,840
It was about 2.2 kilos
for the first round.

370
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,720
That was when I got the first buzz.

371
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,440
This trembling excitement

372
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,400
that my capacity is bigger than me.

373
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,720
The feeling that you are growing
bigger and bigger inside,

374
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,600
and deep and unknown chambers
open up.

375
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,480
Just a slip of a boy, Uncle Jeno,

376
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,080
and I still had the right feeling.

377
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,760
I wanted to bet him
200 cognac cherries,

378
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,760
they were a rarity then,
all went for export.

379
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,520
We didn't have them,
not even at Christmas.

380
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,000
But he said it was over,
and we had to leave.

381
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,320
"You're a fucking liar!"
I said to him. He didn't dare hit me.

382
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,040
He called the guard.

383
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,240
And what did I say?

384
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,040
That I should leave those losers
at Kinizsi Meat.

385
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,880
And that there'd be money
for the tram home

386
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,280
and a small snack after
competitions - sandwiches, juice...

387
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,520
I say the same right now.

388
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,400
And no bullshit.

389
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,560
You've got to work like hell!
Keep practicing!

390
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,400
When speed eating comes
into fashion again,

391
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,000
and the IOC admits it at last,

392
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,160
then we'll show the world

393
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:29,400
that Kálmán Balatony s a

394
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,200
real gem.

395
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:51,440
Dear Comrade Gizella, welcome to
our hospital. Our most modern ward

396
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:56,920
is named after the wife of the martyr
Tibor Szamuely. This is gynaecology.

397
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:00,480
Our doctors are patient and
the examination is painless.

398
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,360
The staff are all excellent...
-That's important.

399
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,880
So, Comrade Gizella...

400
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,640
we transfer you
to vegetable wholesale.

401
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,760
You'll need to pee and we'll take
some blood, all right?

402
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,760
Congratulations!

403
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,560
You know, doctor,
there is a small problem...

404
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,360
Vegetable wholesale.

405
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,640
Yes, but Gizi competes
for the canning factory.

406
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,560
Vegetable wholesale.

407
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,320
They're second division.
-With no calorie allowance.

408
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,360
No way. Internal order.
Pregnant women must transfer.

409
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,880
Cyst or myoma?
-Cyst! -Myoma!

410
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,320
Tibor...

411
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,040
Ilonka...

412
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,280
János...

413
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,320
Or Piroska...

414
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,560
Or Miklós...

415
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,440
Lajos!

416
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,520
Comrade Aczél!

417
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,160
Gizike!

418
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,960
They said I'd find you here.

419
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,440
Comrade Svigadurin
would like to invite

420
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:57,320
our famous sportswoman and
her husband to join us onboard.

421
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,440
And the situation is...

422
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:04,320
well... you know... it was sort
of announced that...

423
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,720
You should give a short...

424
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,720
demonstration...

425
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,720
45 kg of red caviar,

426
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,040
in 20 minutes

427
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,760
in honour of the 20th anniversary
of the liberation.

428
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,760
The first minute is over.

429
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,520
So 45 kilos in 20 minutes,
do you understand?

430
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,320
I don't know,
but my stomach feels very odd.

431
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,240
No wonder after vomiting so much.

432
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,120
But I'm sweating
like Ili Fibinger in Parliament.

433
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,600
Don't be silly, that was
something totally different.

434
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,640
Goose liver got stuck in her throat,
poor thing.

435
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,960
I don't know,
something is definitely not right.

436
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:17,160
Hey, are you crying? You?
The canning factory champion?

437
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,000
Listen.

438
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,120
What about the time with
Fidel Castro and the soup? Hmm?

439
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,280
That great man clapped so hard,

440
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,640
he nearly fell off the podium.

441
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,000
All right, I'll tell the doctor
to stop everything.

442
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,440
Health is more important.

443
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,720
But we'll lose the trip to Sochi.

444
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,880
Come on, pull yourself together.
Wait, I'll blow down!

445
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,440
Dear Comrades...

446
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:45,240
now, more than ever,

447
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,680
we need helping hands to strengthen

448
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,800
the construction of communism...

449
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,280
now, when the most important issues
are real friendship

450
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,160
and honest brotherhood,

451
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,800
I thank you for this commemoration.

452
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,880
Are you OK, pussycat?

453
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,920
Have a drop of cognac!

454
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,400
It hasn't happened
since I was a junior.

455
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,400
That one, on the left,
in the top row.

456
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,320
Is that little Lajos?
-Yeah, he's beautiful.

457
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,680
A bit small though...
-It doesn't matter!

458
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,880
A child is a child.

459
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,840
We'll bring him up, pussycat.

460
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:41,680
LAJOS BALATONY - TAXIDERMIST

461
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,240
Thirty kilos of margarine
and 800 Champion Bars.

462
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,240
And this lolly...

463
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,960
When do you finish today?
-38,526.

464
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,440
Are you here tomorrow?
-Ten bread rolls?

465
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,200
Move your arse!
What are you doing there?

466
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,800
Is that 15 kilos?

467
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,160
Don't spare any!

468
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:06,040
Margarine.
Sticky, oily vegetable fat.

469
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,800
Come on, start eating.

470
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,680
Hurry up, Gréta, what is it then?

471
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,480
Chew faster.
Watch out for the cross-swallow.

472
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,080
They should be able to eat the...

473
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,360
15 kilos by now.

474
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,440
This was well worth it.

475
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,360
She's really coming on!

476
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:42,000
All the hard work
is starting to pay off.

477
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,600
At least on those
who put some effort in.

478
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,760
But you,
I can't even look at you.

479
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,160
Then don't look.
-Sure I won't.

480
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,440
These little things
are the apples of my eye.

481
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,200
I'd give anything just to stroke
those little hairy bellies!

482
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,720
Oh, you are beautiful.

483
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,080
Youuuuu!

484
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,120
Come on, let them out,
just for a minute!

485
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,720
No way.

486
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,640
Later.

487
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,680
I'll open it later. You'll see.

488
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,280
If it snaps,

489
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,120
if notice it snap,

490
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:29,080
I'll have a wash, clean myself

491
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,320
and open the door for Gizike.

492
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,800
You'd have to get up for that.

493
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,040
You'll see.

494
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,960
You watching that shit again?

495
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,680
The losers.

496
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,800
If only I were there!

497
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,720
Can you believe it?
-Yeah, probably.

498
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,520
Arseholes.

499
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,760
Losers.

500
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,600
Gorging.

501
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,000
Arseholes.

502
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,000
I'd be a whatsit by now.

503
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,840
A, you know...

504
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,800
A world star.

505
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,680
But you won't make a fool out of me!

506
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,320
Who?

507
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,480
Should I heat the meat up?
-Los Angeles?

508
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,360
I've never been there.
-And you're not likely to...

509
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:29,240
But the Romanians went,
all the same.

510
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,040
Just look at this!

511
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:01,480
Can I help you?
-Good afternoon.

512
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,240
I've got something.
I was told to come to you.

513
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,000
Wild or domestic?

514
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,400
Not really sure...

515
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,400
domestic, I guess.

516
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,840
Your name?

517
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:26,960
Regoczy.

518
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,760
Andor Regoczy.

519
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,000
Doctor.

520
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,200
How much is this?

521
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,720
It's not for sale.

522
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:11,040
38,526.

523
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,720
Only if you keep the schedule.

524
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,920
No meat until then.

525
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,880
Everything in its own time.

526
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,880
Black pudding

527
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,080
or industrial lard.

528
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,640
Well, if you don't eat Lajoska
before then,

529
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,480
though there's not much on him.

530
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,720
My little kittens.

531
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:52,960
All right,

532
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
grow nice and big.

533
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,960
You're my world sensation.

534
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:05,120
You could even be on television.

535
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:07,360
Sure you could.

536
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,400
If there was somebody

537
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:14,000
who'd arrange it! Right?

538
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,600
Clever girl, Gizi.

539
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:23,520
I myself started with fat.

540
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,840
A long time back.
-And that's how it should be.

541
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,200
Come on, kitty,

542
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,200
eat it.

543
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,320
Maybe if you took the wrapper off...

544
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,320
Watch this!

545
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,440
Can you see?

546
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,280
And the silver paper?

547
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,640
It just slips down.

548
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,920
I can do 400 plain bars an hour

549
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:17,120
but 570 with the silver paper on.

550
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,920
And does it come out?
-It gets absorbed.

551
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:32,560
I've never eaten anything that
should get absorbed and didn't.

552
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,920
It finds a role in the body.

553
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,840
Now, listen.

554
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,000
Check the time.

555
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,200
Ah, I'm just wasting my breath.

556
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,760
Cyst.

557
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,360
What did you say?

558
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:35,960
Dad? -Don't you realise that
I'm ashamed because of you?

559
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:45,120
Because of me?
And you make me puke!

560
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:50,320
I've never done anything but...
for you! -Why do you come then?

561
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,920
You don't have to do me a favour!

562
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:55,000
Carcass stuffer!

563
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,720
Alright then.

564
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,440
That's enough.
I just wonder

565
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,840
how long you'd survive.
For how many days?

566
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:06,680
You'd die of hunger, together
with your stinking competition cats.

567
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:10,400
You'd drown in shit and filth!
You can't go to the loo

568
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:14,320
by yourself. -I can manage.
You don't have to do me any favours.

569
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,480
How would you manage?
I'm curious! Under yourself?

570
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:18,840
Get lost, shoo.

571
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,760
You don't realize that there's
no one you haven't chased away.

572
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:29,080
Only me, I'm such a fucked up idiot.
I won't come anymore, for sure.

573
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Who else would pay for pile of food
that you and these cats get through?

574
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,760
You son of a bitch!

575
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,600
Mum was right.

576
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:48,560
She was right when she left.

577
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:54,400
She didn't want to stay
in your huge fat arse

578
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:59,440
and rot along with you.
Because everything rots here.

579
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:02,520
Everything. But I won't!

580
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:07,040
Remember that! Loser!
Do you understand?

581
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:10,880
I'll smash your face, you shit!
Who do you think you are?

582
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,360
You loser.
-So what? You want to hit me?

583
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,680
Come and hit me then.

584
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,360
It's never too late.

585
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,800
A fatherly slap.

586
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,120
Once in your life. Come on then,

587
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,520
I'll let you!

588
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:33,840
You don't even deserve a slap,
you bastard!

589
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,160
You stinking sack of shit!

590
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,880
Don't you bullshit a world star.

591
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:47,800
Just for comparison:
Igor Vostongonov made it with 3:21...

592
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,480
In '69...
-Still no reason to bullshit me!

593
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,400
You carcass stuffer!

594
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:58,440
You don't know who I am!
What I've been through!

595
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:03,520
I worked hard!
I worked hard for success!

596
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,920
Who are you kidding,
you little runt?

597
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:09,880
I had a vomiting technique
named after me! -Drop dead!

598
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,440
Chick!

599
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,520
We've got an infrared cabin,

600
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:25,760
sauna and turbo solarium
in the basement.

601
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:29,240
The recreation room
is next to the fitness room.

602
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:35,440
We've got back massage,
ayurvedic hand and head massage,

603
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:40,800
Swedish, Thai and sports massage
as well as tailor-made...

604
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:44,960
So you need to repeat this exercise
twenty times.

605
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,880
You could do fewer.

606
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:50,400
Stop for a while and rest
if you're tired.

607
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:53,920
Try not to push it
too much at the start

608
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,440
but focus on your muscles
and breathing.

609
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,560
In, out.

610
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,240
Alright, very good.

611
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:09,120
Don't do it too hard,

612
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,480
you can slow down a bit.

613
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,160
Focus on your body,
feel your muscles.

614
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:17,320
This exercise is good for your
pecs and can do wonders.

615
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,480
You'll notice the difference

616
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,680
when you leave the gym.

617
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,880
Five more to go, and then finished.

618
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,040
Good, very good.

619
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,520
Slower,

620
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,120
try to keep the distance
between your arms.

621
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,000
Good.

622
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,520
Well done,
finished for today,

623
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:53,840
stop it now.

624
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,600
Stop.

625
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,680
38,526.

626
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,760
1,474 back.

627
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,280
Here you are.

628
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,040
Good bye!

629
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:19,360
Dad.

630
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,400
It's me.

631
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:37,680
I'm back.

632
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,800
Fuck you, Galamb,
what are you doing!

633
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,560
Well, Dad.
You'll look really good.

634
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,560
Excuse me.

635
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:13,600
Hey!

636
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,520
Excuse me...

637
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,760
