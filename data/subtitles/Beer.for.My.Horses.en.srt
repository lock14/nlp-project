00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:16,915
<i>All right.</i>

2
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,695
<i>We'll start this next set</i>
<i>with a song about</i>

3
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,097
<i>the North Texas,</i>
<i>Southern Oklahoma,</i>

4
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,299
<i>crystal meth,</i>
<i>amphetamine industry.</i>

5
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,047
<i># Strap them kids in #</i>

6
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:52,618
<i># Give them a little bit</i>
<i>Of vodka in a cherry coke #</i>

7
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:57,656
<i># We're going to Oklahoma</i>
<i>To the family reunion #</i>

8
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,625
<i># For the first time</i>
<i>In years #</i>

9
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:02,361
<i># It's up at uncle Slayton's #</i>

10
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:04,596
<i># 'Cause he's getting on</i>
<i>In years #</i>

11
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:09,201
<i># He plays that Choctaw bingo</i>
<i>Every Friday night #</i>

12
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,770
<i># You know he had</i>
<i>To leave Texas #</i>

13
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:14,073
<i># But he won't say why #</i>

14
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:18,911
<i># He owns a quarter section</i>
<i>Up by Lake Eufala #</i>

15
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,313
<i># Caught a great big ol'</i>
<i>Blue cat #</i>

16
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,582
<i># On a driftin' jug line #</i>

17
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:28,053
<i># Sells his hardwood timber</i>
<i>To the shipping mill #</i>

18
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:32,825
<i># Cooks that crystal meth</i>
<i>Because the shine don't sell #</i>

19
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:37,496
<i># He cooks that crystal meth</i>
<i>Because the shine don't sell #</i>

20
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:42,468
<i># You know he likes that money</i>
<i>He don't mind the smell #</i>

21
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:56,115
<i># He plays that Choctaw bingo</i>

22
00:01:56,116 --> 00:02:00,586
<i># He drinks his Johnny Walker</i>

23
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,222
<i># We're gonna strap them</i>
<i>Kids in #</i>

24
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,691
<i># Give 'em a little bit</i>
<i>A Benadryl #</i>

25
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:10,362
<i># And a cherry coke</i>
<i>We're goin' to Oklahoma #</i>

26
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:13,232
<i># Gonna have us a time #</i>

27
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,870
<i># Have us a time #</i>

28
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:45,564
It's out of here.

29
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,602
Wee-haw!

30
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,582
Well, here we go again, buddy.

31
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,552
Hey, Jer.

32
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,555
I sure like your new truck.

33
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:15,127
Get the hell out of here,
Norvel.

34
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,495
Or there's gonna be trouble.

35
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,531
See that?

36
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,001
It's my trailer, you cheater.

37
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:25,204
You tell your boyfriend
come on out here,

38
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,972
take a look at his new ride.

39
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,076
I told you, he ain't here.

40
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,945
I'll knock out
his headlights too.

41
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:39,318
Hey. I better get to this.

42
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,421
Whoa, Sandy. Norvel.
Get off my head.

43
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,090
Hey. Hey.
- Get off me.

44
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:46,859
Get your hands off me.

45
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,495
She's a cheater, Rack.

46
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:53,499
Hey. Hey. Settle down.
Tell me what happened.

47
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,468
My brother come up here today
to borrow my minnow bucket,

48
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,938
because he's going fishing
with Bobby Bell this afternoon.

49
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,175
So what?
He saw Jerry Buckey

50
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,344
sneaking in my trailer,
that's what!

51
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,246
Your brother didn't see
jack squat.

52
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,547
Sandy, now, let him talk.

53
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,582
Shut up, Lonnie.
Sandy, calm down.

54
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,451
Go ahead, Norvel.

55
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,953
Well, I raced right over here
from work,

56
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:18,891
and by God if I didn't see
Jerry Buckey's truck,

57
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:21,326
parked right here.

58
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,461
And I just

59
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,829
snapped.

60
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,598
Well, partner,
that ain't Jerry Buckey's truck.

61
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:28,701
It ain't?

62
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,869
This truck here you tore up,

63
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,172
that belongs to Jay Boy Simpson.

64
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,486
Uh-oh.

65
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,520
Now, is it true?

66
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,923
Jerry Buckey been here
with you, baby?

67
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:52,257
You know me, Rack.

68
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:54,893
I'm a lot of things
but I ain't no cheater.

69
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:57,563
I would never even think
of cheating on Norvel.

70
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:58,831
I haven't even seen
Jerry Buckey

71
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,933
since last Friday.
- Hey, Rack.

72
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:03,402
Now, Sandy, you know
good and well Norvel loves you.

73
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,871
Oh, the hell he does.
He never takes me anywhere.

74
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,706
Why, he was telling me
the other morning

75
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,775
he had big, big plans
for you this weekend.

76
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:12,611
What?
Ain't that right, Norvel?

77
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:16,081
Oh. Oh, yeah, Rack. It is.

78
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,951
I was gonna take here
to eat catfish.

79
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,085
You was?

80
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,722
You was gonna take me
to eat catfish?

81
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,257
Yeah.

82
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,493
And hushpuppies too?

83
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,762
Yeah.

84
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,563
Oh, Norvel.

85
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:32,931
I love catfish.

86
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,467
I know you do, baby.

87
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,136
Oh, Norvel.

88
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,071
I'm so sorry.

89
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,639
I'm sorry too, baby.

90
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,742
I love you, baby.
I love you too, baby.

91
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,944
Ain't love beautiful?

92
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,379
Let's roll.

93
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,314
All right, y'all,
take care.

94
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:51,216
We'll see y'all next week.

95
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,384
Bye, Rack.

96
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,553
Bye, Lonnie.
Thank you.

97
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,800
I don't want any thanks, either.
If he came in...

98
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,704
Hey, babe.
Where are we going?

99
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,872
"Hey, babe.
Where are we going?"

100
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,176
Cam, I'm late. I'm sorry.

101
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,346
There's late,
and there's too late.

102
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,281
You're the second.

103
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:24,616
I had to take that prisoner
over to Lawton.

104
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:26,185
What am I suppose to tell
the sheriff?

105
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:28,187
You tell him it's
your girlfriend's birthday

106
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,855
and you're suppose to be home
hours ago.

107
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,024
I did.
- Oh, yeah? What did he say?

108
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,792
He said, "Take that prisoner
over to Lawton."

109
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:37,563
You know what?
I'm just sick of your excuses.

110
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,931
It's always,
you're working late

111
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,566
or you're there with
your buddies.

112
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,701
You know what? I'm really glad
you're having a good time.

113
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,137
I'm glad you like to party.
I'm glad you like to have fun.

114
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,106
But unfortunately,
you never like to do it with me.

115
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:49,008
Cammie.

116
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,243
Cammie.
I got you something, baby.

117
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,213
This ought to be good. What?

118
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,849
Oh, it's nothing big.
It's just a little something

119
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,019
I wrapped up in a pair
of underwear. Threw in my pants.

120
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,622
Jerk!
- Damn, Cammie.

121
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,691
Damn, Cammie, don't.
This is crazy.

122
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,498
Do you remember
your birthday last year?

123
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,033
Let me remind you.

124
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:17,703
I put on that sleazy little
cocktail outfit,

125
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:21,340
just like that floozy-ass poker
waitress you like so much

126
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,409
down at the Indian casino.

127
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,977
You came in here,

128
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,478
you didn't say hello.

129
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,281
You sat on that couch, you eat
pork rinds, drink beer,

130
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,084
and you fell asleep watching
<i>Coal Miner's Daughter.</i>

131
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:33,285
That was real nice.

132
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:38,223
I like <i>Coal Miner's Daughter.</i>
Cammie.

133
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,327
You hit my mower.

134
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,629
Asshole.

135
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,771
What have I done?

136
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:09,788
Well, looks like Daddy's gonna
have to get him a new mower.

137
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,165
Oh, yeah, Rack,

138
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,367
looking good.

139
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,905
Hey, boys, what you doing?

140
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,782
Damn, Lisa,
you're looking good, baby.

141
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,417
I wonder if
she's still mad at me?

142
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:39,418
Hey, Lis.

143
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:41,954
Ooh...

144
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,051
Mornin', Peabody.
- All right.

145
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,153
Uh, hey, you got a little

146
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:15,354
donut right there on you.

147
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,755
Here?
No, over here.

148
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,595
Mornin', Rack.
- Mornin'.

149
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,298
I forgot to tell you yesterday,
Cammie called.

150
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,633
Oh, yeah?
Is she okay?

151
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:30,736
She's fine. How's George doing?
- Just horny as hell.

152
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,172
Well, I can see why.
- You know, that's nice.

153
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,740
But ever since he sold
my ThighMaster,

154
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,642
my ass just swelled up.

155
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,713
Well, cowboys
like fat calves.

156
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:44,249
I hear the hardware store
is having a sale on lawn mowers.

157
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,885
You might wanna get one.

158
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,960
What's up, Skunk?

159
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,131
I did it. I did it, Rack.

160
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:02,067
I taught Junior how to detect
the smell of drugs. Sit, boy.

161
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,702
Sit, Junior. No.

162
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,004
Stay.

163
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:09,875
You're gonna love this.

164
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:10,976
Drugs.

165
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:13,645
No peeking.

166
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,447
Okay. Here we go.

167
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,383
Okay, boy.

168
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,319
Find the drugs, Junior.

169
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,488
Hold on.

170
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,490
Come here, Junior.
Turn around.

171
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:25,791
Now get ready.

172
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,026
All right. Come on.

173
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:28,594
Here we go.

174
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:31,764
All right, Junior, go ahead.

175
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:33,132
Find the drugs.

176
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,101
Find the drugs, Junior.

177
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:40,072
Come on, Junior.
Find the drugs.

178
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,141
Give him a second.
- That's really good, Lonnie.

179
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,942
You know, he might actually
be able to find them

180
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,244
if you glue them to his balls.

181
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,990
What are you turds up to?

182
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,125
Uh, nothing, sheriff.

183
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,960
Well, we're gonna have to
change that.

184
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,829
You boys are working
this weekend.

185
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,764
Work?
- Yeah, work.

186
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,933
It's the opposite of what
you usually do.

187
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:09,568
Jackson County Co-Op.

188
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:12,271
You're gonna stake it out
Saturday night.

189
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,306
Someone's been stealing
anhydrous ammonia

190
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,375
from the co-op tanks
and we're gonna catch them.

191
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,911
Well, why would anybody
wanna steal fertilizer?

192
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:22,081
Why would anyone
name a baby Lonnie?

193
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:23,882
It's what they use
to cook meth with.

194
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,384
Sheriff Wells over at Altus

195
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,553
says it's getting to be
a big problem over there.

196
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,655
These smaller co-ops
are easier to hit.

197
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:32,558
Sheriff, why can't
these two guys do the stakeout?

198
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,260
Well, because I said so,
that's why.

199
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,130
Besides, these boys worked
the high school prom

200
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,432
last Saturday night.
- That's nice.

201
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,834
Least they were working
this time.

202
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:44,436
Last time they were at prom,
I believe they went as a couple.

203
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,407
Eat me.
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?

204
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:49,875
Ah, ah.
That's quite enough.

205
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,577
We'll take care
of this, sheriff.

206
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,512
See you boys Monday.

207
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:59,118
You get rid of that--
That damn dog, will you?

208
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,020
Well, it's a K9 recruit, sir.

209
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,921
Right. Get rid of it.

210
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,091
Skunk?

211
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,529
You're a deputy.
Try to look like one.

212
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:14,033
Where is your gun?

213
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,637
Where's your badge?

214
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,178
Why do I try?

215
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:36,889
This sucks.

216
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,358
Staring at fertilizer tanks
on a Saturday night.

217
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,826
It's ridiculous.

218
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,961
Why don't you try complaining
a little bit more about it.

219
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,630
See if that helps.

220
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,166
You got something better to do?
- I did.

221
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:50,469
I was gonna stay home
and take off all my clothes.

222
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,071
Becky was gonna
take off all her clothes,

223
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:53,739
and we were gonna do
some other stuff

224
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,875
that didn't include looking
at fertilizer tanks with you.

225
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,479
How come Skunk never talks?

226
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,147
He speaks when he's got
something to say.

227
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:05,284
I've known him my whole life,
he's never said one word to me.

228
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,552
Yeah, he don't talk much.

229
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:09,788
But he is about the best cop
I ever knew.

230
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,156
I'm a-pretend
I didn't hear that.

231
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,561
How come he carries
that bow and arrow?

232
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,663
You mean, you don't know?
- No.

233
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:21,166
Skunk was orphaned
at a real young age,

234
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,835
and raised on a reservation

235
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:25,371
by a great Kiowa
Indian war chief.

236
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:26,538
I didn't know that.

237
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,208
Yeah. You know that, uh,
pilgrim-looking fellow

238
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:31,110
on the outside of
the Quaker Oats box?

239
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,345
You mean, the one that
looks like Barbara Bush?

240
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:34,980
Yeah, him.
- Yeah.

241
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,584
Skunk's great, great
grandfather killed him.

242
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,686
Really?

243
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:42,588
Wow...

244
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:45,491
And then he cooked him
in less than a minute.

245
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:49,595
That's bullshit.

246
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,264
It is bullshit.

247
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:55,134
But he was raised on
a reservation. I promise you.

248
00:13:58,038 --> 00:13:59,605
Dang, Lonnie. God.

249
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:00,673
What?

250
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,141
You got a sour stomach?

251
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:04,309
I didn't do that,
Junior did.

252
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,012
Hey, you know what? I've noticed
something about Junior.

253
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,615
Whenever he farts,
something big's about to happen.

254
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:19,425
I wonder what
these boys doing out here

255
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:20,626
in the middle of the night.

256
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:22,594
You reckon it's those
fertilizer takers?

257
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,396
Fertilizer takers?

258
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,901
He's cutting the lock off
the gate.

259
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:31,036
He don't work here.

260
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,172
If he worked here,
he wouldn't do that.

261
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,274
Let's go, Lonnie.

262
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,844
Take your gun off safety
this time.

263
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,690
Got it, boss.
- Hurry up.

264
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:52,891
Let's do it.

265
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,127
Twenty-five gallons,
five minutes.

266
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:56,729
Twenty-five. Make it happen.
Let's go.

267
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,666
Freeze!
- Yeah. What he said.

268
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,102
Shoot them, <i>pendejo.</i>

269
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:06,905
Damn it, Lonnie.

270
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,474
Let's go. Let's go.

271
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,715
I wouldn't do that.

272
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,933
I give up.

273
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:40,539
Go. Hurry.

274
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,209
Watch these two.
I'll get these other guys.

275
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:49,214
You boys familiar with
good cop/bad cop?

276
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:51,617
Well, the good one just left.

277
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:53,819
Go, go, go.

278
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:01,894
What happened?

279
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,071
<i>This is Rack.</i>

280
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:14,306
All units in the vicinity,
be advised.

281
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,242
Rack, uh, this is Peabody.

282
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,178
What's your--?
What's your...?

283
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,946
<i>Twenty. What's my 20?</i>

284
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,414
Yeah. Your 20.
What's your 20?

285
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,783
I'm in the back of
an old black one-ton flat bed.

286
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:27,186
Request all available backup.

287
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:29,154
Lonnie and Skunk with you?

288
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,389
That's affirmative.

289
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,891
Uh, that is
all available backup.

290
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:42,167
You're under arrest.
Don't make me come in there.

291
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:23,776
Now you've pissed me off.

292
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,065
Boy, we sure nailed them.

293
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,133
That elbow of yours is lethal.

294
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:50,235
I'm-a tell you what,
you hit that guy so hard,

295
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,272
I will never risk you catching
me peeing in your coffee again.

296
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,379
You get the personal items off
the prisoner, file them for me.

297
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,047
You got it.

298
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,249
Well, boys, we're
gonna need all your stuff.

299
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,918
Watches, wallets.

300
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,387
Pictures of your boyfriends.

301
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:09,855
Y'all look like hell.

302
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:12,658
We might have to run out
and buy y'all some Bactine.

303
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,760
We got everything?

304
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:20,165
Well, fellas...

305
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,436
Hey, uh, I'm gonna need
that necklace.

306
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:26,672
Do you want this?

307
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:27,740
Yeah.

308
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:31,610
You cannot have this.

309
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:37,549
Do you understand
what I say to you?

310
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,685
This is <i>familia.</i>

311
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:42,187
You keep your necklace.

312
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:43,655
Because where you're going,

313
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,958
that necklace ain't gonna
be able to help you.

314
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,307
You boys sleep tight.

315
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,877
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

316
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:16,355
<i># Honey, let's get trashed</i>
<i>And throw it all away #</i>

317
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,493
All right.

318
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,863
That figures. We're out
working, they're out drinking.

319
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:28,100
Oh, now, what are you three
stooges doing in here?

320
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:30,769
Yeah, shouldn't you girls
be on the stakeout?

321
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,472
Actually, where we should be
is over at your daddy's house,

322
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:36,575
kicking him in the potatoes
for having sex with your momma.

323
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,243
Hey, now, don't--

324
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:40,179
We always work more
than they do, sheriff.

325
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,381
Actually, they did have to
work tonight.

326
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:45,617
Norvel and Sandy
went out to Catfish Cove,

327
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,286
and they run into
Jay Boy Simpson.

328
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,488
That was one hell of a fight.

329
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,958
Hey, ain't that my bat?

330
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:56,195
Ow!

331
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,330
Well, it ain't love beautiful.
Ain't love beautiful.

332
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:01,500
Hey, Jake,
how about

333
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:03,902
a round of shots for the table
and three beers?

334
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,437
Table number seven.

335
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:07,139
What happened out there
tonight?

336
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,710
Oh, nothing big. High-speed
chased, little scuffle.

337
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,812
Rack?

338
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,581
Caught four guys
stealing fertilizer.

339
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:18,083
Three of them were just local
lowlifes for hire,

340
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:20,619
but this one guy, he's
a Mexican guy. I don't know.

341
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,122
He may be connected. He
seemed to be running the show.

342
00:20:23,123 --> 00:20:24,923
Any idea who that might be?

343
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:27,259
We're working on it.
I'll know something soon.

344
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,895
Anybody hurt?
- Sheriff, this one guy

345
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,164
took one of Skunk's
broadheads right in the ass.

346
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:37,169
He's lucky my boy didn't put one
through his pump station.

347
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,438
Ain't that right, Skunk?

348
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:42,374
That damn bow and arrow
of yours.

349
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,144
Well, listen, here,
I wanna congratulate you boys.

350
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:46,645
A little toast.
- Here we go.

351
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:48,447
Whiskey for my men.

352
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:49,648
Beer for my horses.

353
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,383
<i># Let's get trashed #</i>

354
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:55,788
<i># And throw it all away #</i>
- <i># Throw it all away #</i>

355
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:01,894
"And his sweat
was like drops of blood

356
00:21:01,895 --> 00:21:04,096
falling on the ground."

357
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:07,299
"When he rose from prayer
and went back to the disciples,

358
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,667
"he found them asleep,

359
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:11,337
exhausted from sorrow."

360
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:12,905
"'Why are you sleeping''

361
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:14,206
"he asked.

362
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:15,941
"'Get up and pray

363
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,677
so that you will not fall
into temptation.'"

364
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:20,179
Amen.

365
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,716
If you want salvation,
brethren...

366
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:25,818
Lonnie?
...you got to open your ears

367
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:27,820
and listen to the word
of the Lord.

368
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:31,023
Amen.
You've got to open your eyes

369
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:32,558
and look into the book

370
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,027
and learn to live
by the word of the Lord.

371
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:36,562
Amen.

372
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:38,397
You must wake up
and smell the Bible.

373
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:40,566
A...men.

374
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:42,067
Ain't that so,
Lonnie Freeman?

375
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:44,737
Amen.

376
00:21:54,014 --> 00:21:55,581
Reverend Parker,

377
00:21:55,582 --> 00:21:58,083
that was a wonderful message
you gave today.

378
00:21:58,084 --> 00:22:00,386
Really?
What was your favorite part?

379
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:03,956
Oh, you know, the whole thing
about God being great.

380
00:22:03,957 --> 00:22:07,292
And devil being an ass
and stuff.

381
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:08,794
I feel like a new man.

382
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:12,464
Oh, I bet you do considering
all the sleep you got.

383
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:13,832
Come on, Becky.
- Thank you.

384
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,034
Lonnie.

385
00:22:15,035 --> 00:22:18,337
We'll see you tomorrow, Lonnie.
- Okay, buddy.

386
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,973
We missed Cammie this morning.
Is everything okay?

387
00:22:20,974 --> 00:22:23,242
She's just fine. She's a
little bit under the weather.

388
00:22:23,243 --> 00:22:26,378
You know, couples just don't
seem to stay together anymore.

389
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:28,647
It's kinda sad.
- Heh.

390
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:30,482
Yeah, it's sad, all right.

391
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:33,385
Well, I'll see you later,
preacher.

392
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:35,988
Rack?
- Yeah?

393
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:38,924
You can borrow my lawn mower
any time you need it, son.

394
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,307
Johnny Franks? Heh.

395
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,544
I thought youse in jail.
- Nope.

396
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:01,847
You staying out of trouble, boy?
Oh, yes, I am, Mr. Deputy, sir.

397
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:03,549
Yes, sir.
- Good.

398
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,883
You ain't.

399
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:07,853
Are you high, Johnny?

400
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:10,089
You screwed up, deputy.

401
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,924
Bigtime.
- Yeah.

402
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:15,294
You know that, uh--?
That Mexican guy you arrested?

403
00:23:15,295 --> 00:23:17,196
His name's Tito.

404
00:23:17,197 --> 00:23:19,365
And his brother,
he's gonna kill you.

405
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:21,233
Somebody's gonna kill me?

406
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:24,069
That's big news, Johnny.
- Thanks.

407
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,171
Here's some news for you.

408
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:27,606
You're not a rapper.

409
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:29,174
So pull your pants up.
- What--?

410
00:23:31,044 --> 00:23:33,012
You know, you don't know
who you're messing with.

411
00:23:33,013 --> 00:23:34,646
They'll kill you
if you're ain't careful.

412
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,515
You let me worry about that.

413
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:38,584
Boogie.

414
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:39,885
They'll kill you.

415
00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:43,722
Hey, Lonnie.
- Hey, Rack. Heh!

416
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:46,992
That's my partner.
- Well.

417
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:50,229
Twist my nipples, look who's here.
- Hey, darling.

418
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,664
You lookin' a little rough
this morning, Rack.

419
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:54,833
Oh, I'm all right.
- Where's Cammie?

420
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:58,003
She went on vacation.
- Really? Where'd she go?

421
00:23:58,004 --> 00:23:59,438
I'm not sure.

422
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:02,207
You-all break up again?

423
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:03,175
Yeah.
- I already heard.

424
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:05,577
You want your usual, baby?

425
00:24:07,414 --> 00:24:08,514
And then Junior farted,

426
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:10,149
and I knew something big
was gonna happen.

427
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,351
Then, about that time,
the tip of the Zebco

428
00:24:12,352 --> 00:24:13,819
just went straight down
in the water.

429
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,120
And I just set the hook.

430
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,589
And I fought that son of a bitch
for about 20 minutes.

431
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:21,193
It was a snapping turtle.

432
00:24:22,362 --> 00:24:24,897
Rack, I am surprised
you even let him carry a gun.

433
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:28,567
Do you hear Annie Streets
was back in town?

434
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:29,802
No, really?
- Yeah.

435
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:31,637
Her momma
got the Alzheimer's,

436
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:34,406
and she flew in from Chicago,
help take care of her.

437
00:24:34,407 --> 00:24:36,975
Well, what about her stepdad?
Don't he take care of her?

438
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,510
Buck Baker? Shit.

439
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:40,713
All he cares about
is making money.

440
00:24:40,714 --> 00:24:42,548
He's too busy
trying to bully farmers

441
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:45,284
into selling him their land
for a dime on the dollar.

442
00:24:45,285 --> 00:24:48,053
Hell, he practically owns
every farm in the county now.

443
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:49,588
He never got Daddy's farm.

444
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,757
Well, he's one of the few
that stood up to him.

445
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:53,692
Rest his soul.

446
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:56,428
When I was dating Annie,
me and him never got along.

447
00:24:56,429 --> 00:24:57,830
You know,
I always just knew

448
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:59,898
you two would get married
someday.

449
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:02,067
She wanted to go off
and see the big city.

450
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:03,469
There's no way I was leaving.

451
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:07,840
You've still got it for her.
You always have.

452
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:09,441
Why don't you go see her?

453
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:11,677
She probably got some
big high-dollar boyfriend

454
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:13,779
back in Chicago.
I saw her here the other day.

455
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,781
She didn't have no ring
on her finger.

456
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:17,950
We had our time together
a long time ago.

457
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:22,087
Anybody ever tell you
you are stone lazy?

458
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:24,923
Annie is the only female
ever come close

459
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:26,458
to giving you a run
for your money.

460
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:28,660
And that's what you were
missing in your life,

461
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:30,162
in case youse a-wondering.

462
00:25:30,163 --> 00:25:32,531
So why don't you leave me
a big fat tip,

463
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:35,300
get off your sorry ass,
and go see her?

464
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:38,337
And take her something nice.

465
00:26:04,497 --> 00:26:07,666
It's a little cool
out here.

466
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:09,968
Here you go.

467
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:11,270
Keep you warm.

468
00:26:17,377 --> 00:26:19,011
Oh, my God.

469
00:26:19,012 --> 00:26:20,045
Momma?

470
00:26:21,548 --> 00:26:23,315
Joe Bill Racklin.

471
00:26:23,316 --> 00:26:24,917
What in the world?

472
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:26,819
Hi, Annie.

473
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,787
What are you doing out here?

474
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:30,856
Oh, I don't know. I guess
I just wanted to come out here

475
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:34,059
and see what a big-city girl
looks like these days.

476
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,061
Heh! Oh, yeah, well,
what do you think?

477
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:38,597
Well, she looks a lot
like a, uh, small-town girl

478
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:40,566
I used to know
a long time ago.

479
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:41,900
Pretty as a picture.

480
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:44,470
Oh, stop it, Rack. What
are you really doing out here?

481
00:26:44,471 --> 00:26:46,572
Well, actually, I came here
to bring you some corn dogs

482
00:26:46,573 --> 00:26:47,806
from the Tasty Cream.

483
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:50,843
I remember how much you
used to like them so much.

484
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,347
Wow.

485
00:26:55,348 --> 00:26:57,049
Well, I didn't really
have much of a choice,

486
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,917
'cause it was the only place
you'd ever take me.

487
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:01,720
Uh, I got you
some, uh...

488
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,024
mustard here somewhere.

489
00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:07,326
Damn.

490
00:27:09,396 --> 00:27:12,564
I got you the wrong one.
I got ketchup. I got--

491
00:27:12,565 --> 00:27:14,433
Rack,
you haven't changed a bit.

492
00:27:14,434 --> 00:27:16,368
Is that a good thing?

493
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:17,936
Yeah, I guess.

494
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:20,472
Been a long time, Annie.

495
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:22,775
Yeah, it sure has.

496
00:27:22,776 --> 00:27:26,245
So, uh, Buck's got quite a place
here, huh?

497
00:27:26,246 --> 00:27:28,647
Yeah, it's changed a lot
since I left.

498
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:30,683
He bought up a whole lot
of acreage.

499
00:27:30,684 --> 00:27:32,551
See all those buildings
over there?

500
00:27:32,552 --> 00:27:33,752
All new.

501
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:36,021
Trucks a-going
day and night.

502
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:38,123
Wow.
- Yeah.

503
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,592
Mrs. Baker?

504
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:44,163
I think the last time
I was out here was when you--

505
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:45,798
Hey, Rack.

506
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:47,766
How you doing there,
buddy?

507
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:49,068
Hey, Buck.

508
00:27:49,069 --> 00:27:52,137
How's the, uh, deputy life
suiting you?

509
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:54,106
It's honest dollar.

510
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:57,843
An honest dollar.

511
00:27:57,844 --> 00:28:00,112
You and your daddy both.

512
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:04,950
I was sorry to hear
about his heart attack.

513
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:08,320
Looks like he kinda
worked himself to death, huh?

514
00:28:08,321 --> 00:28:10,022
Rack, why don't you
come on inside

515
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:11,890
and I'll fix you
some sweet tea?

516
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:14,193
Oh, that's okay, Annie. I
probably gotta get back to town.

517
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:19,231
I got some deputy stuff
I need to go take care of.

518
00:28:19,232 --> 00:28:20,833
I'll see you.

519
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:22,568
Hey, Rack!

520
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:27,306
If you, uh, ever decide
to sell your daddy's farm,

521
00:28:27,307 --> 00:28:28,874
call me first.

522
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:33,112
Hell, you ain't no farmer, son.

523
00:28:33,113 --> 00:28:35,314
You're a bigtime deputy.

524
00:28:39,786 --> 00:28:42,454
Does it take practice
being a grade-A asshole, Buck,

525
00:28:42,455 --> 00:28:44,423
or were you just born one?

526
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:53,899
Born one.

527
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:03,876
Hey, buddy.
Are we still going pig hunting?

528
00:29:03,877 --> 00:29:06,445
I thought you and Becky
was going over to Lawton.

529
00:29:06,446 --> 00:29:08,647
No, she's, uh, keeping
her sister's kids and that,

530
00:29:08,648 --> 00:29:10,249
so Daddy's got a hall pass.

531
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,018
Well, by God, then it looks like
we're going pig hunting.

532
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:14,253
What the hell
are you doing?

533
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:15,888
Rack, watch this.

534
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:17,456
Okay, Junior.

535
00:29:17,457 --> 00:29:18,657
Bite me, boy.

536
00:29:20,393 --> 00:29:22,428
Bite me, Junior.

537
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:24,797
Bite me, Junior.
Junior, bite me.

538
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:26,899
He did it earlier.
Come on, Junior.

539
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:30,102
Bite me. Damn it, Junior.
Attack me.

540
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:31,770
Lonnie, cut that racket,
will you?

541
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:33,439
Get rid of that fleabag.

542
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,841
Yes, sir.
Come on, Junior.

543
00:29:35,842 --> 00:29:37,176
Let's go.

544
00:29:37,177 --> 00:29:38,811
Any news on that Mexican boy?

545
00:29:38,812 --> 00:29:40,546
Uh, we send the prints
over to the feds.

546
00:29:40,547 --> 00:29:42,214
We're still waiting
on a positive ID.

547
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:43,916
Okay.
Hey, Mavis?

548
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:46,318
We get that, uh, fax in
from Oklahoma City yet?

549
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:49,521
No, but you'll be
the first to know when I do.

550
00:29:50,657 --> 00:29:52,257
Sheriff in?

551
00:29:52,258 --> 00:29:54,793
How about a "good morning"?

552
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,462
Just tell the sheriff I'm here.

553
00:29:59,332 --> 00:30:01,734
Hey. Ungh!

554
00:30:01,735 --> 00:30:04,803
Sheriff, the DA's here.
- What's he want?

555
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:07,106
An ass-whupping,
the way he's talking to me.

556
00:30:07,107 --> 00:30:09,575
Mavis, you send him on
back here then.

557
00:30:09,576 --> 00:30:11,410
Oh, that's--

558
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:19,418
I knew I smelled
something rotten.

559
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:22,688
Well...

560
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:25,224
Hear you boys had a big weekend.

561
00:30:25,225 --> 00:30:27,226
Congratulations
on the arrests,

562
00:30:27,227 --> 00:30:30,863
but, uh, we need to discuss
this case.

563
00:30:30,864 --> 00:30:32,164
What's to discuss?

564
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:34,166
Well, I spoke
with the judge,

565
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:36,402
and we don't think we have
a good enough case--

566
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:38,037
You don't have a good case?
- No.

567
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:39,905
We caught 'em stealing
red-handed.

568
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,775
Fertilizer.

569
00:30:42,776 --> 00:30:45,310
Caught 'em stealing fertilizer.

570
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:47,479
Heh! Frankly, gentlemen,

571
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,582
we feel this entire affair
has been totally mishandled.

572
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:52,518
Mishandled?
They fired shots at us.

573
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,987
Rack, let me handle this.

574
00:30:54,988 --> 00:30:56,055
Close the door.

575
00:30:58,124 --> 00:31:01,326
I mean, close the door with you
on the other side of it.

576
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,871
Now, the truth of the matter is

577
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:15,641
we don't really know
what these boys were planning

578
00:31:15,642 --> 00:31:17,476
on doing with the fertilizer.

579
00:31:17,477 --> 00:31:20,212
We all know what they were
gonna do with that fertilizer.

580
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:21,580
They weren't tending
sick lilies.

581
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:22,981
They're making meth.

582
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:25,684
Then we should have had the feds
come in and take care of it.

583
00:31:25,685 --> 00:31:27,586
You've already
blown the opportunity

584
00:31:27,587 --> 00:31:29,455
to set up
surveillance operations,

585
00:31:29,456 --> 00:31:31,824
tracking their money sources,

586
00:31:31,825 --> 00:31:33,559
making them lead us
to the big boys

587
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,395
in their manufacturing
and distribution network.

588
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:37,429
And now,

589
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:41,500
because of your, uh,
rogue deputies there,

590
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:45,738
we got nothing to show for it,
except maybe a lawsuit

591
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:48,707
for skewering a man's buttocks
with an arrow.

592
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:50,042
I mean-- Hee-hee!

593
00:31:50,043 --> 00:31:52,878
What the hell kind of a
department are you running here?

594
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,685
Is this what you've been
waiting for, Rack?

595
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:02,454
Yeah.

596
00:32:02,455 --> 00:32:05,758
This may be of interest to you,
Mr. DA.

597
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:08,093
Tito Garza,
wanted on federal charges.

598
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:11,030
Drug trafficking, racketeering,
attempted murder charge.

599
00:32:11,031 --> 00:32:13,432
Feds want us to deliver him
to Oklahoma City on Saturday.

600
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:16,535
Well, I'll, uh, run that by
the judge, see what's what.

601
00:32:16,536 --> 00:32:18,504
You may wanna take a look
at that file too, sheriff.

602
00:32:18,505 --> 00:32:21,206
Thank you, Mavis. Well, what
have we got here? Who's this?

603
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:24,109
That's Manny Garza.
That's Tito's brother.

604
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,377
He heads up-- Oh, nothing.

605
00:32:25,378 --> 00:32:28,213
--just the biggest drug cartel
in all of Mexico.

606
00:32:28,214 --> 00:32:30,549
Well, this is
terribly interesting,

607
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:33,152
but I am due in court.

608
00:32:33,153 --> 00:32:34,953
If you'll excuse me.
- Mm-hm.

609
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,957
You have a nice day, Mr. L.

610
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:41,260
Fall out boys,
off your ass, on your feet,

611
00:32:41,261 --> 00:32:42,628
out of the shade
and in the heat.

612
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:44,730
We're going to the courthouse
for your arraignments.

613
00:32:44,731 --> 00:32:46,665
On the hop.
Let's go, move it, girls!

614
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:48,567
Get out!
- Hey, easy.

615
00:32:48,568 --> 00:32:51,003
Not you, hotshot.

616
00:32:51,004 --> 00:32:53,472
You earned yourself a few more
nights here at the five-star.

617
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:56,075
Looks like you got a big date
with the FBI.

618
00:32:56,076 --> 00:32:58,744
You know, my brother gonna come
looking for you.

619
00:32:58,745 --> 00:33:01,213
And you're not gonna like it
when he finds you.

620
00:33:01,214 --> 00:33:05,084
Heh-heh! Well, you tell
your brother this, tough guy.

621
00:33:05,085 --> 00:33:07,519
I'm easy to find.

622
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,456
Thursday night,
I'm pig hunting with Lonnie.

623
00:33:10,457 --> 00:33:13,325
Friday night, I'm drinking beer
at the Thirsty Monkey.

624
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:14,793
Saturday morning,
I'll be at my house

625
00:33:14,794 --> 00:33:16,495
drinking coffee
at the kitchen table.

626
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:18,030
And Saturday afternoon,

627
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:20,099
I'm taking your ass
to Oklahoma City

628
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,002
so you can find a horny convict
to be your love piñata

629
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:25,270
for the next 50 years.

630
00:33:25,271 --> 00:33:27,006
<i>Comprende?</i>

631
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:28,374
Come on, Lonnie.

632
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:30,576
Let this guy stay here.

633
00:33:48,962 --> 00:33:50,362
Hey, stranger,
what are you doing?

634
00:33:50,363 --> 00:33:51,897
I was about to ask you
the same thing,

635
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:54,066
driving down the wrong side
of the road like that.

636
00:33:54,067 --> 00:33:55,434
Isn't that illegal?

637
00:33:55,435 --> 00:33:57,536
Well, not if it's official
police business, it's not.

638
00:33:57,537 --> 00:33:59,571
Oh, so that's what this is?

639
00:33:59,572 --> 00:34:01,940
Well, if anybody asks,
it is.

640
00:34:02,842 --> 00:34:04,643
So are you lost?

641
00:34:04,644 --> 00:34:08,480
No, I just came into town
to pick up a few things.

642
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:10,082
How's your momma doing?

643
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,918
She's all right.
- Yeah?

644
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:15,354
She's resting.
- Hm.

645
00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:17,823
So, uh,

646
00:34:17,824 --> 00:34:19,358
I was gonna run over to Altus

647
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,627
and catch a movie
tomorrow night.

648
00:34:21,628 --> 00:34:22,828
By yourself?

649
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:24,363
Well, if you're not going.

650
00:34:26,366 --> 00:34:28,734
Yeah. Yeah, I'm going.
- Yeah?

651
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:31,036
All right. So I'll pick you up
at Buck's house?

652
00:34:31,037 --> 00:34:33,839
Why don't I come by your place?
- Okay.

653
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,674
How about 6:00ish?

654
00:34:35,675 --> 00:34:37,276
How about 6:00?

655
00:34:37,277 --> 00:34:38,510
How about I'll be there?

656
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:39,845
Uh-huh.

657
00:34:40,814 --> 00:34:42,915
Mm-mm.

658
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:45,784
Now, let me get a little
of you walking home.

659
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:50,022
Damn. Mm-mm.

660
00:34:58,064 --> 00:35:00,432
Sure is nice out
here tonight, ain't it?

661
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:03,335
Well, that's all it is.
I gotta piss.

662
00:35:03,336 --> 00:35:05,738
I knew we should've gone down
to the river.

663
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:08,040
There ain't a pig out here.
- How would you know?

664
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:10,876
Rack, I've hunted pigs
my whole life.

665
00:35:10,877 --> 00:35:13,779
I've probably killed more pigs
than any man in Greer County.

666
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:17,149
Is that so?
- It's primal instincts.

667
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,885
I know how they eat.
I know how they sleep.

668
00:35:19,886 --> 00:35:21,420
I know
their breeding habits.

669
00:35:21,421 --> 00:35:23,589
I can talk to them
if I need to. Heh-heh!

670
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,824
You can talk to pigs?
- Yup.

671
00:35:25,825 --> 00:35:28,127
Lonnie,
you're full of pig shit.

672
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,462
Say what you want, Rack,

673
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:33,866
but I am a pig's
worst nightmare.

674
00:35:33,867 --> 00:35:37,102
The last thing
a pig wants to see coming

675
00:35:37,103 --> 00:35:39,872
is Lonnie Luther Freeman.
- Luther?

676
00:35:39,873 --> 00:35:42,541
Yeah.
- That's your middle name? Luther?

677
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:43,842
Be careful.

678
00:35:43,843 --> 00:35:45,144
You know what I did
to the last guy

679
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:46,645
that made fun
of my middle name?

680
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:47,746
What's that?

681
00:35:47,747 --> 00:35:51,116
Not a whole lot.
He's about 6'4", 250.

682
00:35:57,157 --> 00:35:59,425
You know, we could always drive
over to the Thirsty Monkey.

683
00:35:59,426 --> 00:36:01,193
There's a lot of pigs
over there.

684
00:36:01,194 --> 00:36:04,897
No, Rack. You know,
I'm done chasing women.

685
00:36:04,898 --> 00:36:07,666
I got Becky, and I'm happy.

686
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:09,234
She don't complain about me,

687
00:36:09,235 --> 00:36:11,503
and she don't mind me
complaining about her.

688
00:36:15,775 --> 00:36:17,876
You-all ever think about
getting married?

689
00:36:17,877 --> 00:36:20,245
Oh, she does,
all the time.

690
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:21,747
You know,
I'm just afraid if we did

691
00:36:21,748 --> 00:36:24,550
she wouldn't be as inclined
to take as good care of herself

692
00:36:24,551 --> 00:36:26,085
as she does now,
you know?

693
00:36:26,086 --> 00:36:27,586
I mean, hell,
you've seen her sister.

694
00:36:27,587 --> 00:36:29,355
Ugh.

695
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:31,223
You gotta be at the table early
at Thanksgiving

696
00:36:31,224 --> 00:36:32,658
when she's around.

697
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:34,493
My Lord.

698
00:36:34,494 --> 00:36:36,295
She did kinda swell up,
didn't she?

699
00:36:36,296 --> 00:36:38,130
Oh, like a eight-legged
dog tick.

700
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,635
Hey, did, uh,
Cammie ever come back?

701
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:45,037
No, I don't think
she's coming back.

702
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:46,805
I think she's gone for good.

703
00:36:46,806 --> 00:36:50,342
Aw. Oh, man. I'm sorry
to hear about that.

704
00:36:50,343 --> 00:36:52,311
Guess who is back in town.
- Who?

705
00:36:52,312 --> 00:36:54,246
Annie Streets.
- My God,

706
00:36:54,247 --> 00:36:56,448
she was hotter than donut grease
back in high school.

707
00:36:56,449 --> 00:36:58,050
She still is.

708
00:36:58,051 --> 00:36:59,852
And I got a date with her
tomorrow night.

709
00:36:59,853 --> 00:37:01,286
You dog.

710
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:02,988
You dog.

711
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:04,590
Well, if you're
gonna keep her this time,

712
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:07,159
maybe you oughta try doing
something a little different.

713
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,329
I'm gonna suggest
not being yourself.

714
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:13,098
I do need to get my shit
together.

715
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:14,333
You?

716
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:15,968
Yeah.
- Huh. Heh-heh!

717
00:37:15,969 --> 00:37:17,369
You want a beer?

718
00:37:18,838 --> 00:37:21,507
If you're not gonna talk to me,
Rack, just take me home.

719
00:37:33,186 --> 00:37:35,854
What?

720
00:37:35,855 --> 00:37:37,790
I had a nice time tonight.

721
00:37:37,791 --> 00:37:40,626
Well, the night ain't over yet.
Let's go for a walk.

722
00:37:40,627 --> 00:37:43,128
Oh, I don't know,
the streets of Altus, Oklahoma

723
00:37:43,129 --> 00:37:45,364
could be pretty dangerous
this time of night.

724
00:37:45,365 --> 00:37:47,333
I'll take my chances.

725
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,737
Rack?

726
00:37:51,738 --> 00:37:53,172
What?

727
00:37:54,307 --> 00:37:56,175
Oh, I just wanted
to apologize

728
00:37:56,176 --> 00:37:58,477
for what Buck said to you
the other day

729
00:37:58,478 --> 00:38:00,713
and disrespecting your daddy
like that.

730
00:38:00,714 --> 00:38:01,914
Don't worry about that.

731
00:38:01,915 --> 00:38:04,783
That stepdaddy of yours
is a piece of work.

732
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:06,385
What'd your momma
ever see in him anyway?

733
00:38:06,386 --> 00:38:07,753
Heh! I don't know.

734
00:38:07,754 --> 00:38:10,222
But I think at the beginning,
she really did love him.

735
00:38:10,223 --> 00:38:11,623
Then it became more about
security

736
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:13,659
and making sure
I was taken care of.

737
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,729
God bless her.
How do you put up with him?

738
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,163
It's not easy.

739
00:38:18,164 --> 00:38:21,266
If Momma didn't live there,
I wouldn't need him.

740
00:38:21,267 --> 00:38:22,701
So who's gonna take care
of your momma

741
00:38:22,702 --> 00:38:24,837
when you go back to Chicago?

742
00:38:26,873 --> 00:38:29,575
Well, I'm not sure
I'm going back.

743
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:32,478
What do you mean?

744
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:34,780
Momma needs me,

745
00:38:34,781 --> 00:38:36,949
and I miss small-town life,
Rack.

746
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:39,918
The big city's
too fast for me.

747
00:38:39,919 --> 00:38:42,421
I miss the people here.
I miss the pace.

748
00:38:42,422 --> 00:38:45,591
Heck, I even miss
the Tasty Cream.

749
00:38:47,127 --> 00:38:49,495
Believe it or not,

750
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:52,598
I kinda missed you too.

751
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:54,800
I missed you too, Annie.

752
00:38:57,537 --> 00:39:00,906
I-I got you something.
Heh-heh!

753
00:39:00,907 --> 00:39:02,875
Yeah, um...

754
00:39:02,876 --> 00:39:04,143
Here. Heh.

755
00:39:04,144 --> 00:39:05,944
Where did you get that?

756
00:39:05,945 --> 00:39:07,746
Dug it out of
an old box yesterday.

757
00:39:07,747 --> 00:39:10,382
Your daddy took it.
I thought you might want it.

758
00:39:10,383 --> 00:39:12,651
Remember our first date?
Your old truck broke down,

759
00:39:12,652 --> 00:39:14,787
and we had to walk
all that way back in the rain.

760
00:39:14,788 --> 00:39:18,290
Wow. Thanks, Annie.
Golly, we were soaked.

761
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:20,459
I never thanked you
for wearing that white T-shirt.

762
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:24,663
Those were good times, Rack.

763
00:39:24,664 --> 00:39:26,965
Yes, they were.
- Yeah.

764
00:39:45,652 --> 00:39:47,953
Wow.

765
00:39:47,954 --> 00:39:49,488
You've been practicing.

766
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:52,091
Well, you've been gone
a long time.

767
00:39:52,092 --> 00:39:54,059
Well, we should do this again.

768
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,729
Well,
the night ain't over yet.

769
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,597
Well,
what do you wanna do?

770
00:39:58,598 --> 00:40:00,399
I don't know, maybe we'd...

771
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,669
go get a corn dog
and go to my house?

772
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,572
Oh, Rack, you're so romantic.

773
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:08,540
Corn dog?

774
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:31,523
Well, I think I got her

775
00:41:31,524 --> 00:41:33,258
fertilizing for you there--

776
00:41:33,259 --> 00:41:34,560
There, Rack.

777
00:41:34,561 --> 00:41:37,396
I appreciate you getting here
on such short notice, Bob.

778
00:41:37,397 --> 00:41:38,731
Ah, short notice,
long notice,

779
00:41:38,732 --> 00:41:40,265
it don't make
no difference to me.

780
00:41:40,266 --> 00:41:41,533
I ain't been--
I ain't been--

781
00:41:41,534 --> 00:41:43,702
I ain't been
too busy today, anyhow.

782
00:41:43,703 --> 00:41:46,305
Well, I tell you. You plumbers
sure are lifesavers.

783
00:41:46,306 --> 00:41:47,573
Well, I'll tell you what,

784
00:41:47,574 --> 00:41:49,174
I appreciate that,
but you know what?

785
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:52,444
This job,
it ain't, uh, what it's, uh--

786
00:41:52,445 --> 00:41:54,013
It's cracked up to be.
- Must be hard.

787
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:55,514
Bet it is.
There are three things--

788
00:41:55,515 --> 00:42:00,753
There is, uh--
Three things to, uh--

789
00:42:00,754 --> 00:42:03,622
There are three things
to be a plumber.

790
00:42:03,623 --> 00:42:05,090
I'm talking about
a good plumber.

791
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:06,392
What's that?

792
00:42:06,393 --> 00:42:08,694
Shit runs downhill.

793
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:10,696
Don't chew your fingernails.

794
00:42:10,697 --> 00:42:12,631
And payday is on Friday.

795
00:42:12,632 --> 00:42:13,999
I believe that.

796
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,934
Hey, I'll see around. All right.
- Okay, Rack.

797
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,436
Toodles.
- Hello?

798
00:42:24,544 --> 00:42:27,146
Buck Baker called the sheriff
early this morning.

799
00:42:27,147 --> 00:42:28,280
He was all upset.

800
00:42:28,281 --> 00:42:29,682
Annie didn't come home.

801
00:42:29,683 --> 00:42:32,851
We found her car out here,
abandoned.

802
00:42:36,623 --> 00:42:38,257
The car is clean, Rack.

803
00:42:38,258 --> 00:42:39,858
The keys
still in the ignition.

804
00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:42,394
The purse is there
with nothing missing.

805
00:42:42,395 --> 00:42:44,496
Wasn't a robbery.

806
00:42:44,497 --> 00:42:46,799
We don't have
any witnesses.

807
00:43:01,614 --> 00:43:02,681
Hey, Buck.

808
00:43:02,682 --> 00:43:04,383
Levins,
what are you doing here?

809
00:43:04,384 --> 00:43:07,553
Just checking up on Buck,
seeing how he's doing.

810
00:43:07,554 --> 00:43:10,022
Can I talk to him?
- Come on in.

811
00:43:11,624 --> 00:43:13,025
Rack.

812
00:43:13,026 --> 00:43:15,127
Buck, what can you tell me
about Annie?

813
00:43:15,128 --> 00:43:17,029
Well, she left about 6:00
yesterday evening.

814
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,997
I haven't seen her since.

815
00:43:18,998 --> 00:43:20,065
You guys heard anything?

816
00:43:20,066 --> 00:43:21,800
Where she was last night?
What she did?

817
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:22,801
Well, she was with me

818
00:43:22,802 --> 00:43:24,536
last night.
- She was with you?

819
00:43:24,537 --> 00:43:25,637
Yeah, we went over

820
00:43:25,638 --> 00:43:27,106
to Altus
and saw a movie.

821
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:29,875
Well, where did she go
after the movie?

822
00:43:29,876 --> 00:43:32,745
Buck, she stayed the night
at my house

823
00:43:32,746 --> 00:43:34,980
and got up sometime
early this morning and left.

824
00:43:34,981 --> 00:43:36,849
You were the last one with her.
- Yeah.

825
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,050
You'd think

826
00:43:38,051 --> 00:43:39,752
if your daughter's
screwing a cop,

827
00:43:39,753 --> 00:43:41,020
at least she'd be safe.

828
00:43:41,021 --> 00:43:42,488
You watch your mouth, Buck.

829
00:43:42,489 --> 00:43:45,024
Rack, you gotta understand
this don't look so good.

830
00:43:45,025 --> 00:43:47,326
You were the last one to see her

831
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,894
before she disappeared.

832
00:43:48,895 --> 00:43:49,895
You ain't sayin'--
- No.

833
00:43:49,896 --> 00:43:51,830
Maybe you shouldn't be
on this case.

834
00:43:51,831 --> 00:43:53,732
I came over here 'cause I'm
lookin' for Annie.

835
00:43:53,733 --> 00:43:56,168
I think you've done enough,
Rack, don't you?

836
00:43:56,169 --> 00:43:58,003
Buck, I'll talk
with the sheriff.

837
00:43:58,004 --> 00:44:00,806
We'll find Annie.

838
00:44:00,807 --> 00:44:01,874
I think it's time

839
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:04,943
for you to leave.

840
00:44:04,944 --> 00:44:07,246
Jesus Christ.

841
00:44:09,449 --> 00:44:10,916
You don't think
I did this, do you?

842
00:44:10,917 --> 00:44:14,053
Oh, hell no. Levins called.
He thinks it's a problem.

843
00:44:14,054 --> 00:44:15,454
You're not taking me off this.

844
00:44:15,455 --> 00:44:16,955
It's about Annie.
- I understand that.

845
00:44:16,956 --> 00:44:18,157
We'll keep you in the loop.

846
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:19,425
But you cannot be seen
out there

847
00:44:19,426 --> 00:44:20,759
working on this case.

848
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,997
You understand that?
We'll find her, all right?

849
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:26,131
Johnny Franks.

850
00:44:26,132 --> 00:44:28,067
<i>He's clean, sheriff.</i>

851
00:44:28,068 --> 00:44:30,302
<i>He was at the Main Street Cafe</i>
<i>all morning.</i>

852
00:44:30,303 --> 00:44:32,938
<i>Talked to Barb and a few locals</i>
<i>who were there.</i>

853
00:44:32,939 --> 00:44:35,140
His story checks out.
- Sheriff?

854
00:44:35,141 --> 00:44:37,943
This sounds important.
You better punch up Line 2.

855
00:44:43,283 --> 00:44:45,150
Sheriff Landry.

856
00:44:45,151 --> 00:44:48,053
<i>Bring my brother</i>
<i>to the center of Market Square</i>

857
00:44:48,054 --> 00:44:50,255
in Santa Luna, Mexico.

858
00:44:50,256 --> 00:44:52,224
Sundown, this Friday.

859
00:44:52,225 --> 00:44:53,325
Once my brother is released,

860
00:44:53,326 --> 00:44:55,060
<i>you'll get the girl.</i>

861
00:44:55,061 --> 00:44:57,529
<i>At one minute later,</i>
<i>if I don't see my brother,</i>

862
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:00,733
I'll assume
you want me to kill her.

863
00:45:00,734 --> 00:45:03,168
And I will.

864
00:45:03,169 --> 00:45:05,104
<i>Do you understand?</i>

865
00:45:05,105 --> 00:45:08,007
Yeah, I understand.

866
00:45:08,008 --> 00:45:10,209
How do I contact you till then?

867
00:45:11,745 --> 00:45:12,945
Oh, shit.

868
00:45:14,314 --> 00:45:16,548
Wait, wait, wait.
Rack. Hold on, Rack.

869
00:45:16,549 --> 00:45:17,649
Hold him. Hold him.

870
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:20,185
Hold up. Stop.

871
00:45:20,186 --> 00:45:21,820
Where do you think you're going?
- Mexico.

872
00:45:21,821 --> 00:45:22,955
You're not going to Mexico.

873
00:45:22,956 --> 00:45:26,091
This is no
small-town thug here.

874
00:45:26,092 --> 00:45:27,092
This is bigger than us.

875
00:45:27,093 --> 00:45:28,327
They got Annie.

876
00:45:28,328 --> 00:45:29,862
Hey, I don't care
about that right now.

877
00:45:29,863 --> 00:45:31,163
You listen to me.

878
00:45:31,164 --> 00:45:33,032
They could have Annie
right here in this county,

879
00:45:33,033 --> 00:45:37,169
and you wanna go down to Mexico
and do something stupid.

880
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,640
You with me on this?

881
00:45:43,576 --> 00:45:44,610
Yeah.

882
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:46,078
We'll let you know.

883
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,148
You take the afternoon off.
Cool down.

884
00:45:50,116 --> 00:45:53,986
<i># I need to see your face #</i>

885
00:45:53,987 --> 00:45:57,923
<i># Baby, I drove by your place #</i>

886
00:45:57,924 --> 00:46:00,893
<i># But you're still not there #</i>

887
00:46:00,894 --> 00:46:04,163
<i># I can't find you anywhere #</i>

888
00:46:04,164 --> 00:46:07,933
<i># One night was not enough #</i>

889
00:46:07,934 --> 00:46:12,371
<i># You've got this boy</i>
<i>Crazy in love #</i>

890
00:46:12,372 --> 00:46:14,707
<i># And if I'm right #</i>

891
00:46:14,708 --> 00:46:17,910
<i># Yeah, baby, if I'm right #</i>

892
00:46:17,911 --> 00:46:23,549
<i># You might need a hero</i>
<i>Tonight #</i>

893
00:46:36,129 --> 00:46:37,730
Lonnie.

894
00:46:37,731 --> 00:46:39,398
Lonnie, there's someone
at the door.

895
00:46:39,399 --> 00:46:40,432
Ah. Tell 'em we're not here.

896
00:46:40,433 --> 00:46:41,734
Lonnie, get up.
- Wake up.

897
00:46:41,735 --> 00:46:42,868
Get up.

898
00:46:42,869 --> 00:46:45,738
Damn it, Becky.
- Go answer the door.

899
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:49,408
It's 3 in the morning.
Who's at the door?

900
00:46:50,543 --> 00:46:52,411
I'm comin'.

901
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:59,151
Hold on.

902
00:47:00,387 --> 00:47:02,521
Rack?
- Lonnie, let's go.

903
00:47:02,522 --> 00:47:04,656
Go where?
Mexico. I'm gonna go get Annie.

904
00:47:04,657 --> 00:47:06,825
You're not supposed
to be workin' on this case.

905
00:47:06,826 --> 00:47:08,127
Sheriff said.
- You'll need that.

906
00:47:08,128 --> 00:47:09,795
Where's your ammo?
- Bottom drawer.

907
00:47:09,796 --> 00:47:11,864
This is not a good idea.
I'm tellin' you right now.

908
00:47:11,865 --> 00:47:13,599
You gotta think about
what you're doing.

909
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,234
Annie's down in Mexico,
scared to death.

910
00:47:15,235 --> 00:47:18,037
I'm not gonna wait on Landry
to come up with a bullshit plan.

911
00:47:18,038 --> 00:47:19,505
Where's the keys to Thunder?

912
00:47:19,506 --> 00:47:22,908
No. We're not taking my truck.
She's not even broke in yet.

913
00:47:22,909 --> 00:47:23,909
Lonnie?

914
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:25,811
What's going on?
- Hey, Beck.

915
00:47:25,812 --> 00:47:27,179
Lonnie, let's go.

916
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:29,481
Honey, wait right here.
I'll be right back. I promise.

917
00:47:29,482 --> 00:47:32,384
Rack, why do we gotta
take my truck?

918
00:47:34,587 --> 00:47:37,022
You gonna wear those
to Mexico?

919
00:47:37,023 --> 00:47:38,557
Um. Ahem.

920
00:47:38,558 --> 00:47:42,327
Becky got these for me
for Valentime's Day.

921
00:47:42,328 --> 00:47:44,363
They come with
a matching tank top.

922
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:46,265
It just looks too ridiculous.

923
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,335
Well, they're real nice.

924
00:47:51,771 --> 00:47:54,006
Let me get my stuff.

925
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:11,223
Oh, no. You're not bringing
that stupid mutt with us.

926
00:48:11,224 --> 00:48:14,059
Police dog.

927
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:15,561
I don't believe this.

928
00:48:15,562 --> 00:48:19,798
Oh, Jesus, Skunk!
You scared the shit out of me.

929
00:48:19,799 --> 00:48:21,333
Morning, Skunk.

930
00:48:21,334 --> 00:48:23,602
Dead man. That's what I am.

931
00:48:23,603 --> 00:48:26,739
If you two and that Mexican
don't kill me, Becky will.

932
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,540
So did you get everything?
- Yeah.

933
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:30,209
Why do we gotta
take my truck, anyway?

934
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:31,944
'Cause they won't be
looking for your truck.

935
00:48:31,945 --> 00:48:34,813
What are we doing?
- First, we're gonna go get Tito.

936
00:48:34,814 --> 00:48:36,148
Great. How we gonna
pull that off?

937
00:48:36,149 --> 00:48:37,750
Well, who's working
the graveyard shift

938
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:39,084
down at the jail tonight?

939
00:48:39,085 --> 00:48:40,486
Peabody. So what?

940
00:48:40,487 --> 00:48:41,553
So, what happens to Peabody

941
00:48:41,554 --> 00:48:43,689
when he eats too much sugar?

942
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:45,257
He gets sleepy.

943
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,801
Four bear claws.
- Yeah.

944
00:48:55,802 --> 00:48:58,504
Four éclairs,
couple of them cinnamon rolls--

945
00:48:58,505 --> 00:48:59,505
Can I get

946
00:48:59,506 --> 00:49:00,973
two of those chocolatey,
twisty deals

947
00:49:00,974 --> 00:49:02,241
with the sprinkles on top?

948
00:49:02,242 --> 00:49:04,076
I love those. Heh.

949
00:49:04,077 --> 00:49:05,611
Skunk, you--? You want anything?

950
00:49:07,847 --> 00:49:09,982
What? I'm hungry.

951
00:49:12,118 --> 00:49:13,952
Now, what was that
you said you wanted?

952
00:49:17,691 --> 00:49:19,425
Hey, Peabody.
- Oh, hey.

953
00:49:19,426 --> 00:49:22,094
Hey, Lonnie.

954
00:49:22,095 --> 00:49:23,762
What are you doin'
down here this late?

955
00:49:23,763 --> 00:49:25,731
Oh, I was just
in the neighborhood,

956
00:49:25,732 --> 00:49:27,700
and I thought I'd come by
and bring you some donuts,

957
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:29,368
you know, since it's
your birthday and all.

958
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:31,203
It ain't my birthday.

959
00:49:31,204 --> 00:49:32,938
Well, then Merry Christmas.

960
00:49:32,939 --> 00:49:34,406
Well, it's March.
- Hell, Peabody.

961
00:49:34,407 --> 00:49:36,842
I brought you donuts. Can't
a fella bring a friend donuts?

962
00:49:36,843 --> 00:49:37,976
Okay, all right.

963
00:49:37,977 --> 00:49:40,212
All right.

964
00:49:42,048 --> 00:49:43,282
Well...

965
00:49:43,283 --> 00:49:44,883
Well? Well, what?

966
00:49:44,884 --> 00:49:46,452
I don't really care much
for bear claws.

967
00:49:46,453 --> 00:49:48,954
Hey, do you have any of them
chocolatey, twisty deals

968
00:49:48,955 --> 00:49:50,823
with the sprinkles on top?

969
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:52,224
I really love those.

970
00:49:59,366 --> 00:50:00,366
Is he asleep?

971
00:50:00,367 --> 00:50:01,934
Like a big fat baby.

972
00:50:08,475 --> 00:50:09,475
Wake up.

973
00:50:09,476 --> 00:50:13,078
Get your ugly ass up.
Let's go.

974
00:50:14,114 --> 00:50:15,114
Where are we going?

975
00:50:15,115 --> 00:50:16,815
Mexico.

976
00:50:34,601 --> 00:50:36,535
Come on, Junior.

977
00:50:36,536 --> 00:50:39,104
There you go, buddy.
There you go.

978
00:50:39,105 --> 00:50:40,606
Hey, Lonnie.
- Yeah?

979
00:50:40,607 --> 00:50:42,741
Get that windshield. I'm gonna
go and pay for this fuel.

980
00:50:42,742 --> 00:50:43,742
Okay.

981
00:50:43,743 --> 00:50:45,744
Do you want a coffee,
Skunk?

982
00:50:59,959 --> 00:51:03,028
Hi, handsome.

983
00:51:03,029 --> 00:51:04,897
Me?

984
00:51:04,898 --> 00:51:06,532
You like to have
a good time?

985
00:51:07,801 --> 00:51:08,801
Yeah. Heh.

986
00:51:08,802 --> 00:51:10,536
I'm Harveyetta.

987
00:51:10,537 --> 00:51:11,870
I'm Lonnie. Heh.

988
00:51:11,871 --> 00:51:13,439
Who's that dude
in the back seat, huh?

989
00:51:14,974 --> 00:51:16,008
Oh, that's my prisoner.

990
00:51:17,477 --> 00:51:19,144
I'll be your prisoner.

991
00:51:19,145 --> 00:51:20,579
Well,
he's a real prisoner.

992
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:23,115
He's Tito Garza.
He's Manny Garza's brother.

993
00:51:23,116 --> 00:51:26,018
He's wanted by the FBI.
He's a big drug-warhead fella.

994
00:51:26,019 --> 00:51:28,187
He kidnapped Rack's girlfriend.
Now he's in the store.

995
00:51:28,188 --> 00:51:30,322
They're not like boyfriend
or girlfriend or anything.

996
00:51:30,323 --> 00:51:32,591
They, uh-- Uh, we got
till sundown Friday.

997
00:51:32,592 --> 00:51:34,693
We're gonna trade him for Annie.
She lives in Chicago.

998
00:51:34,694 --> 00:51:36,061
Oh. Ha-ha.

999
00:51:36,062 --> 00:51:38,330
Well, that's so...

1000
00:51:38,331 --> 00:51:39,631
hot.

1001
00:51:45,105 --> 00:51:47,139
So that's, uh,
two coffees and, uh...

1002
00:51:48,174 --> 00:51:49,608
Freeze, Snow White!

1003
00:51:49,609 --> 00:51:52,711
This is a hold up.
Give me the cash.

1004
00:51:52,712 --> 00:51:54,046
What are you looking at,
pilgrim?

1005
00:51:54,047 --> 00:51:56,048
Ease up there, Casper.

1006
00:51:56,049 --> 00:51:58,350
All right now, nobody moves and
nobody gets hurt, all right?

1007
00:51:59,786 --> 00:52:00,819
Now, you open that register

1008
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,554
and you give me
the money right now.

1009
00:52:02,555 --> 00:52:05,457
Don't give him jack.
We got two coffees--

1010
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:06,525
You wanna get shot?

1011
00:52:06,526 --> 00:52:07,893
How are you gonna shoot me?

1012
00:52:07,894 --> 00:52:09,094
You got your safety on?

1013
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,467
Sorry about that.

1014
00:52:15,468 --> 00:52:17,102
Throw that away before somebody
gets hurt.

1015
00:52:17,103 --> 00:52:18,871
Um,

1016
00:52:18,872 --> 00:52:20,239
it's--

1017
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,940
That's, uh--

1018
00:52:21,941 --> 00:52:23,876
That's $75 even.

1019
00:52:23,877 --> 00:52:25,778
Heh. I'll be damned.

1020
00:52:25,779 --> 00:52:28,113
Two coffees
and a fill-up, 75 even.

1021
00:52:28,114 --> 00:52:29,748
What are the chances
of that happening?

1022
00:52:31,918 --> 00:52:34,086
I wonder if a sweet little
old girl like me

1023
00:52:34,087 --> 00:52:35,988
could hitch a ride
to the next truck stop

1024
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:39,258
with a big, strong lawman
like you?

1025
00:52:39,259 --> 00:52:41,894
Well, I reckon we could. I--

1026
00:52:41,895 --> 00:52:43,228
I mean, I'm gonna
need to ask Rack.

1027
00:52:43,229 --> 00:52:44,496
Nope.

1028
00:52:44,497 --> 00:52:47,399
Hey, Rack. Hey, listen, uh,
this is Harveyetta.

1029
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,702
She was, uh-- She was wantin' to
know if she could catch a ride

1030
00:52:49,703 --> 00:52:50,903
to the next truck stop.

1031
00:52:50,904 --> 00:52:53,005
Let the hooker go
and get in the truck.

1032
00:52:53,006 --> 00:52:55,074
Hooker?
Rack, she ain't a hooker. Heh.

1033
00:52:55,075 --> 00:52:56,208
She's a good Christian woman.

1034
00:52:56,209 --> 00:52:58,243
She's got
a nice cross necklace on.

1035
00:53:00,647 --> 00:53:03,615
I told you that was
a nice rack necklace.

1036
00:53:03,616 --> 00:53:06,385
I mean, a nice, you know.

1037
00:53:06,386 --> 00:53:08,854
By God, I believe you're right,
Lonnie.

1038
00:53:08,855 --> 00:53:10,556
She is a good Christian woman.

1039
00:53:10,557 --> 00:53:11,924
Mm-hm.
- But she's not goin'.

1040
00:53:11,925 --> 00:53:13,325
Now get in the truck.

1041
00:53:13,326 --> 00:53:14,360
Rack.

1042
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:15,761
Well, but--

1043
00:53:15,762 --> 00:53:17,096
Sorry, Harveyetta.

1044
00:53:17,097 --> 00:53:18,230
Hey, where's Tito?

1045
00:53:19,532 --> 00:53:22,001
He was in the back seat.
He-- He couldn't have--

1046
00:53:22,002 --> 00:53:23,836
Damn it, Lonnie.
I told you to watch him.

1047
00:53:28,174 --> 00:53:30,009
You goin' fishin', Tito?

1048
00:53:36,216 --> 00:53:38,050
Hurts like hell, don't it?

1049
00:53:38,051 --> 00:53:40,886
You got him?
Get him in there.

1050
00:53:46,359 --> 00:53:47,359
Tito.

1051
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,828
What?
- Come here.

1052
00:53:49,829 --> 00:53:51,330
You try that crap again,

1053
00:53:51,331 --> 00:53:52,965
I'm gonna duct tape
your ass to the bumper.

1054
00:53:59,439 --> 00:54:01,040
Oh, my Lord.

1055
00:54:08,014 --> 00:54:09,314
This better be good.

1056
00:54:09,315 --> 00:54:11,483
<i>Sheriff, he's gone.</i>

1057
00:54:11,484 --> 00:54:13,819
<i>Yeah, I don't know where</i>
<i>they went.</i>

1058
00:54:15,221 --> 00:54:19,391
<i>#</i> Love Talk <i>with Lea #</i>

1059
00:54:19,392 --> 00:54:21,727
<i>You are listening to</i>
Love Talk <i>with Lea.</i>

1060
00:54:21,728 --> 00:54:25,064
<i>We are mending hearts</i>
<i>from coast to coast tonight.</i>

1061
00:54:25,065 --> 00:54:27,533
<i>Our first caller</i>
<i>is from Levelland, Texas.</i>

1062
00:54:27,534 --> 00:54:28,867
<i>His name is Danny.</i>

1063
00:54:28,868 --> 00:54:31,036
<i>Hi, Danny.</i>
<i>Who you loving tonight?</i>

1064
00:54:31,037 --> 00:54:33,839
<i>Well, I'm loving</i>
<i>my beautiful wife, Debbie, Lea.</i>

1065
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,741
<i>Well, tell us all
about Debbie, Danny.</i>

1066
00:54:35,742 --> 00:54:38,010
<i>Well, we've been
married for 17 years, Lea,</i>

1067
00:54:38,011 --> 00:54:40,312
<i>and there were times</i>
<i>when I doubted our love</i>

1068
00:54:40,313 --> 00:54:41,814
<i>and I took her for granted,</i>

1069
00:54:41,815 --> 00:54:44,616
<i>till three years ago when I had</i>
<i>the accident on the farm.</i>

1070
00:54:44,617 --> 00:54:47,653
<i>I woke up in the hospital</i>
<i>and both my arms were gone.</i>

1071
00:54:47,654 --> 00:54:49,755
<i>The first thing I thought</i>
<i>that went through my head</i>

1072
00:54:49,756 --> 00:54:53,025
<i>was I'd never be able</i>
<i>to hug my wife again.</i>

1073
00:54:53,026 --> 00:54:55,127
<i>And the second thought was</i>
<i>how was I gonna play catch</i>

1074
00:54:55,128 --> 00:54:56,995
<i>with my little boy.</i>

1075
00:54:56,996 --> 00:54:59,665
<i>And the third thought that was</i>
<i>probably the most devastating</i>

1076
00:54:59,666 --> 00:55:03,669
<i>was how would I defend myself</i>
<i>if someone was tickling me.</i>

1077
00:55:05,105 --> 00:55:06,372
Can I come in?

1078
00:55:06,373 --> 00:55:08,540
I'm freezing my tits off
out here.

1079
00:55:08,541 --> 00:55:09,608
The hell is she doin' here?

1080
00:55:09,609 --> 00:55:11,143
Hey, Harveyetta.

1081
00:55:12,412 --> 00:55:15,280
Just had enough of that
damn hooker, didn't you?

1082
00:55:15,281 --> 00:55:17,916
See what you did?
This is all on you.

1083
00:55:17,917 --> 00:55:19,184
Hey, Harveyetta.
- Howdy.

1084
00:55:19,185 --> 00:55:20,819
Now you march yourself
right around there

1085
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:23,922
and you drive a little while.

1086
00:55:23,923 --> 00:55:25,858
Well, come on. Let's roll.

1087
00:55:25,859 --> 00:55:28,193
And you, young lady, you're
getting off the next truck stop.

1088
00:55:28,194 --> 00:55:29,695
You understand me?

1089
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,778
I've brought you some food,
my dear.

1090
00:55:45,779 --> 00:55:47,312
I wouldn't want
your boyfriend to think

1091
00:55:47,313 --> 00:55:49,882
I wasn't taking care of you.

1092
00:55:54,554 --> 00:55:57,256
I don't like
being insulted.

1093
00:55:59,993 --> 00:56:02,127
Your boyfriend insulted me.

1094
00:56:02,128 --> 00:56:04,463
He took someone
that was very important to me.

1095
00:56:04,464 --> 00:56:05,631
He took my brother.

1096
00:56:07,133 --> 00:56:09,268
Let me show you something.

1097
00:56:11,571 --> 00:56:12,571
Francisco.

1098
00:56:18,411 --> 00:56:19,511
This is Pedro.

1099
00:56:24,451 --> 00:56:26,352
Pedro,

1100
00:56:26,353 --> 00:56:29,188
you took something from me,
didn't you?

1101
00:56:29,189 --> 00:56:31,924
Manuel, please.

1102
00:56:31,925 --> 00:56:33,325
Tell her what you took.

1103
00:56:33,326 --> 00:56:34,793
No, I swear, I took nothing.

1104
00:56:34,794 --> 00:56:36,562
That's not true, Pedro.

1105
00:56:36,563 --> 00:56:38,831
I gave you a package to deliver.

1106
00:56:38,832 --> 00:56:40,599
You were supposed to get money
for the package

1107
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,767
and bring it back to me.

1108
00:56:41,768 --> 00:56:43,168
But you kept the money
for yourself.

1109
00:56:43,169 --> 00:56:46,038
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Manuel.

1110
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:47,806
It's okay.

1111
00:56:47,807 --> 00:56:49,742
It's okay.

1112
00:56:51,778 --> 00:56:54,213
It's okay, <i>perdido.</i>

1113
00:57:05,925 --> 00:57:08,794
I don't like it when people
takes things from me.

1114
00:57:11,531 --> 00:57:12,765
<i>Idiota.</i>

1115
00:57:12,766 --> 00:57:15,167
He's bleeding all over the rug!

1116
00:57:16,803 --> 00:57:20,773
Annie, good help
is so hard to find these days.

1117
00:57:29,883 --> 00:57:33,519
What is that God-awful smell?

1118
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,988
Oh, that's Junior.
Something big's about to happen.

1119
00:57:35,989 --> 00:57:37,022
Who's Junior?

1120
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:38,490
He's my police dog back there.

1121
00:57:44,397 --> 00:57:45,964
Hey, baby.

1122
00:57:48,401 --> 00:57:49,902
Follow us.
<i># Show them to me #</i>

1123
00:57:49,903 --> 00:57:52,538
<i># Show them to me #</i>

1124
00:57:52,539 --> 00:57:55,374
I love you.

1125
00:57:55,375 --> 00:57:59,845
<i># Unclasp your bra</i>
<i>Set those puppies free #</i>

1126
00:57:59,846 --> 00:58:01,080
<i># They'd look</i>
<i>A whole lot better #</i>

1127
00:58:01,081 --> 00:58:02,381
<i># Without that sweater #</i>

1128
00:58:02,382 --> 00:58:05,918
<i># Baby, I'm sure you'll agree #</i>

1129
00:58:05,919 --> 00:58:09,321
<i># If you got two fun bags # </i>

1130
00:58:09,322 --> 00:58:11,123
<i># Show them to me #</i>

1131
00:58:18,498 --> 00:58:20,766
Well, it can't be that hard
to find them.

1132
00:58:20,767 --> 00:58:25,571
Now, I gotta have Tito Gaza
in Oklahoma City on Saturday

1133
00:58:25,572 --> 00:58:27,206
or it is someone's ass.

1134
00:58:27,207 --> 00:58:29,508
Now you find them, damn it.

1135
00:58:30,343 --> 00:58:32,144
Jeez.

1136
00:58:37,217 --> 00:58:39,151
Well, this is
just great, Rack.

1137
00:58:39,152 --> 00:58:40,552
What took me
two years to rebuild,

1138
00:58:40,553 --> 00:58:42,121
took us one day
to screw up.

1139
00:58:42,122 --> 00:58:43,922
Took you one hour
to screw it up.

1140
00:58:43,923 --> 00:58:45,958
I knew we shouldn't have taken
my truck. I knew it.

1141
00:58:45,959 --> 00:58:48,260
Well, you brought us out here
now, and got us in trouble.

1142
00:58:48,261 --> 00:58:49,962
A busted radiator
in the middle of nowhere.

1143
00:58:50,997 --> 00:58:52,531
Uh, fellas.

1144
00:58:54,701 --> 00:58:56,568
Heh. Will somebody
get the Mexican?

1145
00:58:58,838 --> 00:59:00,806
I said get him.
Don't kill him.

1146
00:59:13,053 --> 00:59:15,421
Look like
somebody's comin' up.

1147
00:59:15,422 --> 00:59:18,157
Let's see if we
can get him to help.

1148
00:59:24,064 --> 00:59:25,330
Y'all need any help?

1149
00:59:25,331 --> 00:59:26,331
Yeah, man.

1150
00:59:26,332 --> 00:59:27,666
Where's the closest gas station?

1151
00:59:27,667 --> 00:59:29,868
About 75 miles, I think.

1152
00:59:29,869 --> 00:59:31,236
Damn.

1153
00:59:31,237 --> 00:59:33,005
I'll push you all down there
about 30 minutes.

1154
00:59:33,006 --> 00:59:35,541
I got a campsite.
Got a good mechanic down there.

1155
00:59:35,542 --> 00:59:38,243
I appreciate that, old-timer.
We're in a hell of a hurry.

1156
00:59:53,827 --> 00:59:55,561
Damn.

1157
00:59:56,563 --> 00:59:59,598
So, uh, this girlfriend
of yours,

1158
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:01,100
she means a lot you, huh?

1159
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:03,802
Who told you
I got a girlfriend?

1160
01:00:03,803 --> 01:00:05,404
Lonnie, you got a big mouth.

1161
01:00:05,405 --> 01:00:06,705
Aw.
- Sorry.

1162
01:00:06,706 --> 01:00:09,174
It's like a romantic fairy tale.

1163
01:00:09,175 --> 01:00:10,209
Rack, the white knight,

1164
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:12,144
sweeping in to save
the princess.

1165
01:00:12,145 --> 01:00:14,880
What do you know about
white knights and fairy tales

1166
01:00:14,881 --> 01:00:16,348
in your line of work?

1167
01:00:16,349 --> 01:00:20,519
Well, I-I reckon I made plenty
of fantasies come true.

1168
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:23,355
Yeah. Had your hand in a lot
of happy endings, huh?

1169
01:00:23,356 --> 01:00:25,724
I wrote me a poem down.

1170
01:00:25,725 --> 01:00:28,927
Now, if I ever met
my fantasy guy--? Okay?

1171
01:00:28,928 --> 01:00:30,829
--I'd want him to say
something like this:

1172
01:00:32,332 --> 01:00:33,732
All right.

1173
01:00:33,733 --> 01:00:38,470
<i>When the sun don't rise</i>
<i>and the wind don't blow</i>

1174
01:00:38,471 --> 01:00:40,806
<i>And the seas have</i>
<i>left the shore</i>

1175
01:00:40,807 --> 01:00:44,109
<i>I promise, my dearest</i>
<i>With my dying breath</i>

1176
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:47,112
<i>To love you forevermore</i>

1177
01:00:48,648 --> 01:00:52,051
A man ever says something like
that to me, he'd own my soul.

1178
01:00:53,053 --> 01:00:54,586
Harveyetta,

1179
01:00:54,587 --> 01:00:57,823
that is the stupidest shit
I've ever heard in my life.

1180
01:00:57,824 --> 01:00:59,925
Hey, a gal can dream, can't she?

1181
01:00:59,926 --> 01:01:01,660
I come a long way
from Sweetwater

1182
01:01:01,661 --> 01:01:03,462
to find my white knight.

1183
01:01:03,463 --> 01:01:06,265
Yeah, one truck stop at a time.

1184
01:01:09,469 --> 01:01:11,236
You love this girl of yours?

1185
01:01:11,237 --> 01:01:13,605
I've always loved her.

1186
01:01:13,606 --> 01:01:15,774
You gonna marry her?

1187
01:01:15,775 --> 01:01:17,843
Yeah, maybe someday.

1188
01:01:23,416 --> 01:01:26,885
A boy can dream, can't he?

1189
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:09,661
Here we are, folks.

1190
01:02:09,662 --> 01:02:12,531
Yeah, it's right over there,
what I saw.

1191
01:02:22,308 --> 01:02:23,575
Hey.

1192
01:02:23,576 --> 01:02:25,010
I'm Charlie.

1193
01:02:25,011 --> 01:02:27,413
What kind of horseshit
you got going on here, Charlie?

1194
01:02:28,982 --> 01:02:30,783
This is like our down season,

1195
01:02:30,784 --> 01:02:32,284
you know,
we're traveling show folks.

1196
01:02:32,285 --> 01:02:33,919
Why don't you fix that radiator

1197
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,555
and show us how to travel
the hell out of here.

1198
01:02:36,556 --> 01:02:38,323
This the rig you called
me about, Charlie?

1199
01:02:38,324 --> 01:02:39,491
Hey, this is Jeff.

1200
01:02:39,492 --> 01:02:41,827
He can fix any kind
of vehicle you got.

1201
01:02:41,828 --> 01:02:43,629
Mm.

1202
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:45,064
Handsome and handy, huh?

1203
01:02:45,065 --> 01:02:47,633
That's what my wife says.

1204
01:02:52,939 --> 01:02:55,240
Oh, look, a monkey.

1205
01:02:55,241 --> 01:02:56,442
What do you think?

1206
01:02:56,443 --> 01:02:58,043
What's the chance
of getting it running?

1207
01:02:58,044 --> 01:02:59,378
In a hell of a hurry.

1208
01:02:59,379 --> 01:03:00,446
Hi.
- Well...

1209
01:03:03,316 --> 01:03:06,318
You boys cops or something?

1210
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:07,519
Yeah, Jeff. Come here, man.

1211
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,056
I need a little chat with you.

1212
01:03:11,057 --> 01:03:13,792
I gotta get that guy back there
to Santa Luna, Mexico,

1213
01:03:13,793 --> 01:03:15,027
like, pronto, or there's gonna

1214
01:03:15,028 --> 01:03:18,230
be some really bad
stuff go down.

1215
01:03:18,231 --> 01:03:19,598
So you think you can
get me running?

1216
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:21,967
Yeah, man. I'll get you running
in about four, five hours.

1217
01:03:21,968 --> 01:03:23,102
That's great.

1218
01:03:23,103 --> 01:03:25,771
The thing is,
we just need to find a radiator.

1219
01:03:25,772 --> 01:03:28,574
But I guarantee there's
one here. Follow me.

1220
01:03:38,451 --> 01:03:40,252
You gotta be shitting me.

1221
01:03:42,989 --> 01:03:46,592
She got a shot by a
security guard at the bank

1222
01:03:46,593 --> 01:03:49,261
and she bled to death
in my arms.

1223
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:55,567
That is so...

1224
01:03:56,703 --> 01:03:58,537
hot.

1225
01:03:58,538 --> 01:04:02,574
Yeah. Yeah, you're my kind
of girl. All right.

1226
01:04:02,575 --> 01:04:04,677
We wanna welcome
our new friends here.

1227
01:04:04,678 --> 01:04:06,945
Is everybody sharing

1228
01:04:06,946 --> 01:04:08,580
a cup of circus jolly?

1229
01:04:08,581 --> 01:04:10,349
Jolly.

1230
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:11,750
We make kids laugh,

1231
01:04:11,751 --> 01:04:14,119
we make kids cry.

1232
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,755
That's what we'll do
till the day we die.

1233
01:04:16,756 --> 01:04:19,892
If you love us,
you can fill your glasses,

1234
01:04:19,893 --> 01:04:21,260
and if you don't,

1235
01:04:21,261 --> 01:04:23,762
you can kiss our asses.
- Kiss our asses.

1236
01:04:23,763 --> 01:04:25,531
Jolly.

1237
01:04:30,103 --> 01:04:31,670
Rack, this stuff's pretty good.

1238
01:04:31,671 --> 01:04:33,072
That's elephant piss.

1239
01:04:34,941 --> 01:04:37,309
Just kidding.
Horse piss. Kidding.

1240
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:39,845
Gene's Gypsy wine.

1241
01:04:39,846 --> 01:04:42,781
You know our toasts around here
are kind of a family thing

1242
01:04:42,782 --> 01:04:44,516
even though we're not kin.

1243
01:04:44,517 --> 01:04:48,454
That's old Sniper Sam
over there from Vietnam.

1244
01:04:48,455 --> 01:04:51,523
Been a carny for 35 years.
He's a sharpshooter.

1245
01:04:53,326 --> 01:04:56,261
He was the best man
at both my weddings.

1246
01:04:56,262 --> 01:04:58,797
And you remember
Two Ton Tina over there.

1247
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:02,034
Oh, she's friendly.
She's a hugger.

1248
01:05:03,169 --> 01:05:04,903
Oh, Rack.

1249
01:05:05,972 --> 01:05:08,340
Ladies and gentlemen.

1250
01:05:08,341 --> 01:05:10,476
direct your attention
to the center stage,

1251
01:05:10,477 --> 01:05:13,979
where I,
Merriweather the Magnificent--

1252
01:05:17,717 --> 01:05:21,186
--will attempt an amazing feat

1253
01:05:21,187 --> 01:05:22,755
that I have been practicing
for months

1254
01:05:22,756 --> 01:05:24,023
with piss-poor results.

1255
01:05:26,059 --> 01:05:32,197
In my quest to become the most
daring illusionist of our time,

1256
01:05:32,198 --> 01:05:39,571
my bravery is matched
only by my blind stupidity.

1257
01:05:44,744 --> 01:05:47,079
Ah.

1258
01:05:55,055 --> 01:05:57,056
Isn't that dangerous, Charlie?

1259
01:05:57,057 --> 01:06:01,660
Danger is often just an illusion
created in our minds.

1260
01:06:01,661 --> 01:06:04,430
But when danger
becomes a reality,

1261
01:06:04,431 --> 01:06:07,099
it must be met head-on.

1262
01:06:08,468 --> 01:06:11,904
With an illusion.

1263
01:06:17,744 --> 01:06:19,511
All right, little fellow.

1264
01:06:23,116 --> 01:06:24,950
What's wrong, Lonnie?

1265
01:06:24,951 --> 01:06:26,618
Lost my watch.

1266
01:06:26,619 --> 01:06:28,053
It's...

1267
01:06:28,054 --> 01:06:31,223
twelve-thirty.

1268
01:06:31,224 --> 01:06:33,192
That's my watch.

1269
01:06:33,193 --> 01:06:34,193
He took my watch.

1270
01:06:34,194 --> 01:06:35,461
Sit down, Lonnie.

1271
01:06:35,462 --> 01:06:37,296
Give me my watch,
you shakey old son of a bitch.

1272
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:43,035
You saying I took your watch?

1273
01:06:43,036 --> 01:06:44,737
No, Sam.

1274
01:06:44,738 --> 01:06:49,508
I-I think I left my watch
at the truck stop.

1275
01:06:49,509 --> 01:06:51,143
My mistake.

1276
01:06:51,144 --> 01:06:53,579
Oh, it's no mistake, mister.

1277
01:06:57,517 --> 01:06:59,618
Gotcha! Just kidding, pard.

1278
01:07:16,202 --> 01:07:17,269
There you go, Rack.

1279
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:19,071
You got her fixed?

1280
01:07:19,873 --> 01:07:20,873
Good as new.

1281
01:07:20,874 --> 01:07:22,007
All right, man.

1282
01:07:22,008 --> 01:07:25,477
You're the best.

1283
01:07:25,478 --> 01:07:27,780
Jeff, we'll see you, buddy.
- See you.

1284
01:07:29,949 --> 01:07:31,517
Hey, old Charlie boy
gave me a big old jug

1285
01:07:31,518 --> 01:07:32,685
of the circus jolly last night.

1286
01:07:32,686 --> 01:07:35,254
Yeah?
- I like it.

1287
01:07:35,255 --> 01:07:37,322
Hey, wait. We forgot Harveyetta.

1288
01:07:37,323 --> 01:07:39,558
No, your girlfriend's staying.

1289
01:07:42,262 --> 01:07:44,830
Hooker.

1290
01:07:51,338 --> 01:07:52,538
Sixty-two miles to showdown.

1291
01:07:52,539 --> 01:07:53,539
I can't wait that long.

1292
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:55,207
You gotta pull over.
I gotta pee.

1293
01:07:55,208 --> 01:07:58,043
We just left 35 minutes ago.
You can't hold it?

1294
01:07:58,044 --> 01:08:00,412
The circus jolly is running
right through me. Pull over.

1295
01:08:00,413 --> 01:08:01,647
Jesus Christ, Lonnie.

1296
01:08:01,648 --> 01:08:03,282
Use that cup.

1297
01:08:03,283 --> 01:08:05,384
Look, I don't know about you,
but it takes two hands

1298
01:08:05,385 --> 01:08:06,518
to wrangle what I got.

1299
01:08:06,519 --> 01:08:08,420
Would you like to hold
the cup for me?

1300
01:08:16,129 --> 01:08:17,996
Oh. Ooh.

1301
01:08:20,767 --> 01:08:21,867
Hey, fellas.

1302
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,908
Oh-h-h-h.

1303
01:08:29,909 --> 01:08:31,477
Oh. Oh.

1304
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:35,781
If this thing didn't have
a hole at the end of it,

1305
01:08:35,782 --> 01:08:37,282
it'd look like
a football right now.

1306
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:48,927
They got great acoustics
in here, Rack.

1307
01:08:52,699 --> 01:08:55,734
# You know you make me wanna-- #

1308
01:08:58,004 --> 01:09:01,206
Cigarettes will kill you, man.

1309
01:09:01,207 --> 01:09:03,909
# Now, wai-ai-ait a minute #

1310
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:07,546
# Hm-hm #

1311
01:09:07,547 --> 01:09:09,782
# You know you make me
Wanna shout #

1312
01:09:09,783 --> 01:09:11,183
# Kick my heels up and shout #

1313
01:09:11,184 --> 01:09:12,985
# Throw my hands up and-- #
# Shout #

1314
01:09:12,986 --> 01:09:14,520
# Throw my head back and-- #
# Shout #

1315
01:09:14,521 --> 01:09:15,921
# Come on, now #

1316
01:09:15,922 --> 01:09:18,824
# Don't forget to say you will #
# Shout #

1317
01:09:18,825 --> 01:09:21,927
# Shout #
# Don't forget to say, ye-ah #

1318
01:09:21,928 --> 01:09:24,296
# Shout
Say you will #

1319
01:09:24,297 --> 01:09:27,466
# Say it right now, baby #
# Say you will #

1320
01:09:27,467 --> 01:09:29,234
# Come on, come on #

1321
01:09:29,235 --> 01:09:32,438
# Say you will #
# Say that you-hoo-hoo #

1322
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:33,839
# Say you will #

1323
01:09:35,375 --> 01:09:36,942
# Say #
# Say that you love me #

1324
01:09:36,943 --> 01:09:38,377
# Say #
# Say that you need me #

1325
01:09:38,378 --> 01:09:39,511
# Say #
# Say that you want me #

1326
01:09:39,512 --> 01:09:42,114
# Say #
# You wanna please me #

1327
01:09:42,115 --> 01:09:43,415
# Say #
# Come on, now #

1328
01:09:43,416 --> 01:09:44,950
# Say #

01:09:44,951 --> 01:09:47,152
# Say. Say #
# Come on, now #

1330
01:09:53,993 --> 01:09:57,763
# I want you to know #

1331
01:09:57,764 --> 01:10:00,632
# I said I want you
To know right now #

1332
01:10:00,633 --> 01:10:03,635
# You've been good to me, baby #

1333
01:10:03,636 --> 01:10:07,940
# Better than I been to myself
Hey, hey #

1334
01:10:07,941 --> 01:10:10,909
Come on, man.

1335
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:12,544
# A little bit softer now #
# Shout #

1336
01:10:12,545 --> 01:10:14,146
# A little bit louder now #
# Shout #

1337
01:10:14,147 --> 01:10:15,714
# A little bit louder now #
# Shout #

1338
01:10:15,715 --> 01:10:16,882
# A little bit louder now #

1339
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,987
# Hey-yay-yay-yay #

1340
01:10:21,988 --> 01:10:23,689
# Hey-yay-yay-yay #

1341
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:25,457
# Hey-yay-yay-yay #

1342
01:10:25,458 --> 01:10:27,226
# Hey-yay-yay-yay #

1343
01:10:27,227 --> 01:10:30,095
# Hey-ey-ey-ey #
# Hey-ey-ey-ey #

1344
01:10:30,096 --> 01:10:32,564
# Hey-yeah-yay-yay #
# Hey-yeah-yay-yay #

1345
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:35,234
I really like it here, Rack.

1346
01:10:35,235 --> 01:10:37,069
They got some really friendly
people down here.

1347
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:40,039
Do you think we could come back
when we're not working?

1348
01:10:48,148 --> 01:10:50,783
<i># Well, how did I</i>
<i>Wind up down here #</i>

1349
01:10:50,784 --> 01:10:52,518
<i># In Mexico... #</i>

1350
01:10:52,519 --> 01:10:56,822
Okay, guys, let's try to
be as inconspicuous as possible.

1351
01:11:03,063 --> 01:11:04,763
La puerta: <i>The door.</i>

1352
01:11:04,764 --> 01:11:06,532
<i>La puerta:</i> The door.

1353
01:11:06,533 --> 01:11:08,534
Tengo gusto: <i>I like.</i>

1354
01:11:08,535 --> 01:11:10,836
<i>Tengo gusto:</i> I like.

1355
01:11:10,837 --> 01:11:12,738
Queso: <i>Cheese.</i>

1356
01:11:12,739 --> 01:11:15,040
<i>Queso:</i> Cheese.

1357
01:11:15,041 --> 01:11:16,709
Taengo gusto del queso.

1358
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:18,977
<i>I like cheese.</i>

1359
01:11:18,978 --> 01:11:22,348
<i>Tengo gusto del queso.</i> Ha.

1360
01:11:22,349 --> 01:11:25,317
How about that shit, Rack?
I like cheese.

1361
01:11:25,318 --> 01:11:27,453
You know what I'd like?
I'd like for you to give me time

1362
01:11:27,454 --> 01:11:28,587
to think here for a minute.

1363
01:11:28,588 --> 01:11:29,888
You know what Rack?

1364
01:11:29,889 --> 01:11:32,291
If we're gonna blend in,
we need to know these stuff.

1365
01:11:32,292 --> 01:11:34,526
I can't help it that you're
gonna be at a disadvantage

1366
01:11:34,527 --> 01:11:35,961
because you don't know Spanish.

1367
01:11:39,165 --> 01:11:40,265
Not right now, little buddy.

1368
01:11:40,266 --> 01:11:43,335
Hey, kid, do you speak English?

1369
01:11:43,336 --> 01:11:45,137
<i>No comprenda.</i>

1370
01:11:45,138 --> 01:11:46,705
Are you sure you
don't speak English?

1371
01:11:48,508 --> 01:11:51,410
A little.
- Yeah.

1372
01:11:51,411 --> 01:11:52,945
What's your name?
- Chico.

1373
01:11:52,946 --> 01:11:54,046
Chico, good.

1374
01:11:54,047 --> 01:11:56,215
You know who this guy is?

1375
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,554
No, señor.

1376
01:12:02,555 --> 01:12:04,623
Manuel Garza.

1377
01:12:04,624 --> 01:12:06,625
You know Manuel Garza?

1378
01:12:06,626 --> 01:12:10,396
<i>Si, señor. Gato Diablo.</i>
<i>No bueno.</i>

1379
01:12:10,397 --> 01:12:12,364
Hey, you're telling me
"No bueno."

1380
01:12:12,365 --> 01:12:13,866
You wanna make $50?

1381
01:12:15,235 --> 01:12:16,568
<i>Si.</i>
- Yeah?

1382
01:12:16,569 --> 01:12:17,970
<i>Si, señor.</i>
- All right,

1383
01:12:17,971 --> 01:12:19,471
You wait right here, okay?

1384
01:12:19,472 --> 01:12:21,573
Lonnie, write your cell phone
number down on a paper.

1385
01:12:21,574 --> 01:12:22,641
Oh, yeah, right.

1386
01:12:22,642 --> 01:12:24,877
My truck, my piece of paper,

1387
01:12:24,878 --> 01:12:26,445
my cell phone number.

1388
01:12:26,446 --> 01:12:28,647
Give me that damn necklace.

1389
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:31,617
Hey, Chico. Come here, bud.

1390
01:12:33,353 --> 01:12:34,687
All right.

1391
01:12:36,322 --> 01:12:39,825
You make sure Gato Diablo
gets this, okay?

1392
01:12:39,826 --> 01:12:41,827
<i>Si, señor.</i>

1393
01:12:41,828 --> 01:12:43,629
Señor.

1394
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:45,864
I hope many beautiful women
come to your funeral.

1395
01:12:49,069 --> 01:12:50,536
Hey, Skunk, keep an eye on Tito.

1396
01:12:50,537 --> 01:12:53,105
That kid's a really fast runner.
What are we gonna do?

1397
01:12:53,106 --> 01:12:55,274
Let's go in this cantina
and wait on his call.

1398
01:13:06,953 --> 01:13:08,087
Señor Gato, Señor Gato.

1399
01:13:08,088 --> 01:13:09,455
Stop that boy.

1400
01:13:20,133 --> 01:13:21,433
Whoo!

1401
01:13:21,434 --> 01:13:23,502
That is margarita.

1402
01:13:23,503 --> 01:13:27,039
I believe, that's the biggest
margarita I've ever drank.

1403
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:30,609
They do not mess around
in Mexico, I tell you what.

1404
01:13:33,046 --> 01:13:35,314
You think he's gonna call?

1405
01:13:35,315 --> 01:13:36,682
He'll call.

1406
01:13:40,453 --> 01:13:43,222
Look at that donkey's ass
hanging off the wall over there.

1407
01:13:43,223 --> 01:13:45,791
Somebody mounted the wrong end
of that thing.

1408
01:13:45,792 --> 01:13:47,826
I bet if we walk around
the other side of the building,

1409
01:13:47,827 --> 01:13:49,261
it'll just be stick--

1410
01:13:51,398 --> 01:13:52,865
Y'ello.

1411
01:13:57,671 --> 01:13:59,104
Yo.

1412
01:13:59,105 --> 01:14:00,806
Oh, Mr. Deputy.

1413
01:14:00,807 --> 01:14:01,874
Are you enjoying your stay

1414
01:14:01,875 --> 01:14:04,076
in beautiful Mexico?

1415
01:14:04,077 --> 01:14:07,046
<i>I've lost my
sense of humor, where's Annie?</i>

1416
01:14:07,047 --> 01:14:08,847
No, no, no. Not to worry.

1417
01:14:08,848 --> 01:14:10,983
We are taking great pleasure
in caring for her.

1418
01:14:10,984 --> 01:14:13,419
You touch her and I'll kill you.

1419
01:14:14,654 --> 01:14:17,756
It's not her I want.

1420
01:14:17,757 --> 01:14:18,891
<i>It's you.</i>

1421
01:14:18,892 --> 01:14:20,693
You bring Annie
to Rusty's Cantina.

1422
01:14:20,694 --> 01:14:22,394
Rusty's Cantina, huh?

1423
01:14:22,395 --> 01:14:24,830
<i>Good margaritas.</i>

1424
01:14:25,965 --> 01:14:27,933
<i>Okey-dokey, Mr. Smokey.</i>

1425
01:14:27,934 --> 01:14:30,035
<i>I'll meet you at sundown.</i>

1426
01:14:30,036 --> 01:14:33,972
Bring my brother
if you want to see her alive.

1427
01:14:35,442 --> 01:14:36,442
Let's go.

1428
01:14:36,443 --> 01:14:37,743
Burn him.

1429
01:14:42,582 --> 01:14:46,118
Your boyfriend.
He sounds like a very nice guy.

1430
01:14:46,119 --> 01:14:48,420
I look forward to our meeting.

1431
01:14:48,421 --> 01:14:54,493
I was wondering, do you think
I should wear this or this?

1432
01:14:57,130 --> 01:15:00,099
I think I will bring them both.

1433
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:29,294
Some really scary-looking
guys down there.

1434
01:15:29,295 --> 01:15:32,264
Hey. What are you doing?

1435
01:15:32,265 --> 01:15:33,732
I'm blending in.

1436
01:15:33,733 --> 01:15:35,034
Well, you look ridiculous.

1437
01:15:36,603 --> 01:15:38,237
And he doesn't?

1438
01:15:48,648 --> 01:15:50,582
It's showtime, boys.
They're pulling in.

1439
01:15:50,583 --> 01:15:53,752
What do you see?
About eight or 10 of them.

1440
01:15:53,753 --> 01:15:55,788
There's Manuel,

1441
01:15:55,789 --> 01:15:58,090
and they've got Annie.

1442
01:15:58,091 --> 01:15:59,491
There's Johnny Franks.

1443
01:15:59,492 --> 01:16:02,094
I knew that bastard had
something to do with this.

1444
01:16:02,095 --> 01:16:03,929
Get that Mexican in the truck.

1445
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:05,564
I knew I should have
brought a suitcase.

1446
01:16:05,565 --> 01:16:06,565
Lonnie.

1447
01:16:06,566 --> 01:16:08,667
What?
- Forget the sombrero.

1448
01:16:08,668 --> 01:16:12,171
Rack, I paid 8 bucks for this.
I've always wanted one.

1449
01:16:12,172 --> 01:16:14,206
Besides, right now
it's a disguise.

1450
01:16:15,642 --> 01:16:19,044
But later it's a souvenir.

1451
01:16:19,045 --> 01:16:21,246
Hold that, give me the hat,

1452
01:16:21,247 --> 01:16:23,849
put all this stuff in a bag
and let's go, okay?

1453
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:25,517
And bring a pillowcase with you.

1454
01:16:25,518 --> 01:16:27,553
Pillowcase...

1455
01:16:58,518 --> 01:17:01,353
Remember, when Tito is inside,
lock the doors.

1456
01:17:17,237 --> 01:17:20,205
Welcome, Mr. Deputy.
I see you're right on time.

1457
01:17:20,206 --> 01:17:22,975
Where is Annie?

1458
01:17:22,976 --> 01:17:24,376
What is the rush? Sit down.

1459
01:17:24,377 --> 01:17:25,911
Have a drink.

1460
01:17:25,912 --> 01:17:27,946
I don't drink with assholes.

1461
01:17:27,947 --> 01:17:31,483
Tell me, what is keeping me
from killing you right now?

1462
01:17:35,922 --> 01:17:38,057
That was a perfectly good
donkey's ass.

1463
01:17:38,058 --> 01:17:39,091
Ready to deal?

1464
01:17:39,092 --> 01:17:41,427
Take your big gun away

1465
01:17:41,428 --> 01:17:43,195
from the head of my brother
and release him.

1466
01:17:43,196 --> 01:17:44,463
First, where's Annie?

1467
01:17:46,132 --> 01:17:47,733
Right here, Rack.

1468
01:17:47,734 --> 01:17:48,967
Buck?

1469
01:17:48,968 --> 01:17:50,869
How did you get involved
in this bullshit?

1470
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:52,771
Bullshit?

1471
01:17:52,772 --> 01:17:55,774
Well, I don't mean
to toot my own horn,

1472
01:17:55,775 --> 01:17:58,143
but United Farm Enterprises

1473
01:17:58,144 --> 01:18:00,412
is home to the biggest
meth lab in Oklahoma.

1474
01:18:00,413 --> 01:18:02,114
I provide the land
and the buildings.

1475
01:18:02,115 --> 01:18:05,651
And me, the manpower
and the distribution.

1476
01:18:05,652 --> 01:18:07,386
I see you're in bed
with that damn DA, huh.

1477
01:18:08,388 --> 01:18:10,956
Levin? Oh, he's no problem.

1478
01:18:10,957 --> 01:18:13,392
Give him a little whiskey
and some cash,

1479
01:18:13,393 --> 01:18:16,762
couple of fat Mexican whores,
he's happy as a pig in shit.

1480
01:18:16,763 --> 01:18:18,530
No offense there, Manny.

1481
01:18:18,531 --> 01:18:20,332
They're not all fat.

1482
01:18:20,333 --> 01:18:22,201
So you see, pretty simple.

1483
01:18:22,202 --> 01:18:25,671
I don't need a Deputy-Do-Right
and his girlfriend

1484
01:18:25,672 --> 01:18:28,841
prowling around my ranch
making things complicated.

1485
01:18:28,842 --> 01:18:30,009
Let her go, Buck.

1486
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:32,211
First, release my brother.

1487
01:18:32,212 --> 01:18:33,846
<i>Danger is often</i>

1488
01:18:33,847 --> 01:18:37,516
<i>just an illusion</i>
<i>created in our minds.</i>

1489
01:18:37,517 --> 01:18:39,785
When danger becomes a reality,

1490
01:18:39,786 --> 01:18:42,388
it must be met head-on.

1491
01:18:42,389 --> 01:18:44,223
With an illusion.
What?

1492
01:18:44,224 --> 01:18:46,892
Tito, are you okay?

1493
01:18:46,893 --> 01:18:48,460
<i>La puerta.</i> The door.

1494
01:18:48,461 --> 01:18:50,329
The door?

1495
01:18:51,931 --> 01:18:54,166
<i>Tengo gusto del quesa.</i>

1496
01:18:54,167 --> 01:18:55,868
You taste like cheese?

1497
01:18:58,104 --> 01:18:59,171
Hi, everybody.

1498
01:18:59,172 --> 01:19:00,773
What have you done
with my brother?

1499
01:19:06,746 --> 01:19:08,080
Holy crap.

1500
01:19:37,911 --> 01:19:39,078
Annie.

1501
01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:40,045
Rack.

1502
01:19:41,448 --> 01:19:42,548
Lonnie, cover me.

1503
01:19:48,688 --> 01:19:51,457
Have you no pride, Santo?
Get up and fight!

1504
01:19:58,431 --> 01:19:59,898
Cover me.

1505
01:20:00,734 --> 01:20:02,267
Watch the suit, man.

1506
01:20:26,659 --> 01:20:28,927
Whose idea
was it to lock this door?

1507
01:20:41,541 --> 01:20:43,909
Manuel?

1508
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:46,045
What did you do to my brother?

1509
01:20:46,046 --> 01:20:48,480
Oh, crap.

1510
01:20:48,481 --> 01:20:50,916
I'm going to enjoy this.

1511
01:20:59,859 --> 01:21:01,860
Junior.

1512
01:21:04,798 --> 01:21:06,198
Let her go, Buck.

1513
01:21:06,199 --> 01:21:07,533
Sorry, son.

1514
01:21:07,534 --> 01:21:09,134
We've got to play
this thing out right now.

1515
01:21:09,135 --> 01:21:11,837
You'd kill your own daughter?

1516
01:21:11,838 --> 01:21:14,573
Stepdaughter ain't blood.

1517
01:21:14,574 --> 01:21:16,508
You know, you should
never have come back, honey.

1518
01:21:17,544 --> 01:21:19,078
Your momma's gonna be okay.

1519
01:21:19,079 --> 01:21:21,280
With all that goofy juice
I've been feeding her,

1520
01:21:21,281 --> 01:21:23,248
she won't remember
her own name next week.

1521
01:21:23,249 --> 01:21:24,683
You son of a bitch.

1522
01:21:25,885 --> 01:21:27,353
That's it, Johnny.

1523
01:21:27,354 --> 01:21:28,354
Send him to hell.

1524
01:21:30,857 --> 01:21:32,491
Right destination,
wrong passenger.

1525
01:21:32,492 --> 01:21:34,093
What?

1526
01:21:34,094 --> 01:21:36,628
I don't believe we've met.
Agent Levon Spurlock, FBI.

1527
01:21:36,629 --> 01:21:39,198
What?
Three years undercover, Buck.

1528
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:41,000
Glad to finally see you go down.

1529
01:21:51,578 --> 01:21:53,879
Here, brother. I owe you one.

1530
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:55,948
It's gonna be okay. I got you.

1531
01:21:58,785 --> 01:22:00,919
You all right, baby?

1532
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:03,255
I am now.

1533
01:22:13,867 --> 01:22:15,267
Hey, Rack.

1534
01:22:15,268 --> 01:22:17,169
You know, these boots are nice.

1535
01:22:17,170 --> 01:22:21,106
You can't find these Mexican
silver wing tips in Oklahoma.

1536
01:22:21,107 --> 01:22:24,043
Hey, Johnny. Hey, Annie.

1537
01:22:24,044 --> 01:22:25,744
Hi, Lonnie.

1538
01:22:25,745 --> 01:22:27,446
Meet Agent Levon Spurlock.

1539
01:22:28,648 --> 01:22:30,382
Hey, I'm Lonnie.

1540
01:22:30,383 --> 01:22:32,051
Nice to meet you.

1541
01:22:32,052 --> 01:22:33,485
Look at Junior.

1542
01:22:35,055 --> 01:22:36,922
He put the kick-ass
smack down on Tito.

1543
01:22:38,024 --> 01:22:39,625
Good dog, Junior.

1544
01:22:39,626 --> 01:22:41,026
Police dog.

1545
01:22:58,978 --> 01:23:01,280
<i>Manuel Garza,</i>
<i>the strong-arm leader</i>

Look at the TV.

01:23:17,464 --> 01:23:18,864
<i>An FBI spokesman</i>

1554
01:23:20,266 --> 01:23:22,501
Hey, ain't that Johnny Franks?

1555
01:23:22,502 --> 01:23:26,005
I'd say he is.

1556
01:23:31,177 --> 01:23:33,679
Rack, it's the sheriff calling.
You want me to answer it?

1557
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:37,449
Hell, no. If he's gonna fire me,
he's gonna fire me to my face.

1558
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:39,385
Let's go in here
and have a beer, man.

1559
01:23:39,386 --> 01:23:41,754
Looks real quiet tonight.

1560
01:23:42,856 --> 01:23:44,523
Home sweet home, Lonnie.

1561
01:23:56,069 --> 01:23:57,403
Nice stuff there, Rack.

1562
01:23:59,339 --> 01:24:02,007
There you go, Rack.
What's up, brother?

1563
01:24:03,176 --> 01:24:07,179
I love it. Why you--

1564
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:09,581
I missed you, baby girl.
Look what I got you.

1565
01:24:09,582 --> 01:24:11,917
Oh, Lonnie...
- Got all your favorite colors.

1566
01:24:11,918 --> 01:24:13,419
Oh, I love it,
I love it, I love it.

1567
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:14,920
Oh, I love you. I--

1568
01:24:14,921 --> 01:24:18,157
Hey, Jake, how about some
shot glasses over here?

1569
01:24:24,831 --> 01:24:26,665
Good to see you, Annie.
You okay?

1570
01:24:26,666 --> 01:24:28,400
Yeah.

1571
01:24:28,401 --> 01:24:29,435
And I wanted to say

1572
01:24:29,436 --> 01:24:32,104
thank you so much
for sending this posse

1573
01:24:32,105 --> 01:24:34,139
to come and get me.
- Mm-hm.

1574
01:24:36,276 --> 01:24:37,843
Disobeying orders,

1575
01:24:37,844 --> 01:24:41,447
kidnapping a federal prisoner,

1576
01:24:41,448 --> 01:24:43,849
illegal transfer of said
prisoner across state line,

1577
01:24:43,850 --> 01:24:47,052
unauthorized transport

1578
01:24:47,053 --> 01:24:50,956
and use of firearms
in a foreign country.

1579
01:24:50,957 --> 01:24:52,558
Am I missing anything?

1580
01:24:52,559 --> 01:24:54,026
Yup, yup, you are.

1581
01:24:54,027 --> 01:24:58,063
Uh, not answering the department
issued phone when you called.

1582
01:24:58,064 --> 01:25:02,768
I ought to kick your collective
asses right here and right now.

1583
01:25:02,769 --> 01:25:05,604
Give me one good reason
why I don't lock you up.

1584
01:25:05,605 --> 01:25:08,340
'Cause it's time for a toast.

1585
01:25:14,214 --> 01:25:15,247
Skunk, what is this?

1586
01:25:15,248 --> 01:25:16,348
Circus jolly.

1587
01:25:18,084 --> 01:25:20,819
Rack, Skunk said,
"Circus jolly."

1588
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:23,389
Skunk, you have
a beautiful speaking voice.

1589
01:25:25,091 --> 01:25:26,392
Well, let's hear it.

1590
01:25:26,393 --> 01:25:28,127
Whiskey for my men.

1591
01:25:28,128 --> 01:25:29,762
Beer for my horses.

1592
01:25:34,501 --> 01:25:35,534
Oh, boy.

1593
01:25:35,535 --> 01:25:37,870
That's circus jolly, sheriff.

1594
01:25:37,871 --> 01:25:40,005
Yeah, well, it tastes
like elephant piss.

1595
01:25:41,408 --> 01:25:43,742
# I'm on haystack kicking back
Three bails high #

1596
01:25:43,743 --> 01:25:45,611
# A flat bed stage
And a full moon light #

1597
01:25:45,612 --> 01:25:47,513
# Party on the farm
All night long #

1598
01:25:47,514 --> 01:25:49,515
# With the moon shine flowin'
Till the break of dawn #

1599
01:25:49,516 --> 01:25:51,250
Hey, Annie.

1600
01:25:51,251 --> 01:25:54,653
Baby, I got something
I got to tell you.

1601
01:25:54,654 --> 01:25:59,224
<i>When the sun don't rise</i>
<i>And the winds don't blow</i>

1602
01:25:59,225 --> 01:26:01,293
<i>And the seas</i>
<i>Have left the shore</i>

1603
01:26:01,294 --> 01:26:03,595
<i>I promise my dearest</i>
<i>With my dying breath</i>

1604
01:26:03,596 --> 01:26:05,597
<i>To love you forevermore.</i>

1605
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:11,737
Rack, that's the stupidest
shit I ever heard.

1606
01:26:11,738 --> 01:26:14,073
Did you rip that
out of a Hallmark card

1607
01:26:14,074 --> 01:26:16,275
from the drugstore
over in Mangum?

1608
01:26:16,276 --> 01:26:18,977
No, baby,
I got it from Harveyetta,

1609
01:26:18,978 --> 01:26:20,746
a hooker from Sweetwater.

1610
01:26:20,747 --> 01:26:22,147
# Twelve gauge
Underneath the seat #

1611
01:26:22,148 --> 01:26:23,916
# Gonna raise a little hell
To a down on beat #

1612
01:26:23,917 --> 01:26:26,151
Rack.

1613
01:26:26,152 --> 01:26:28,954
Junior just farted.
Something big's about to happen.

1614
01:26:30,557 --> 01:26:34,226
<i># It's off the hillbilly hook</i>
<i>Off the redneck chain #</i>

1615
01:26:34,227 --> 01:26:38,464
<i># Join the rebel revolution</i>
<i>It's a runaway train #</i>

1616
01:26:38,465 --> 01:26:42,201
<i># We're country boys and girls</i>
<i>Take a real good look #</i>

1617
01:26:42,202 --> 01:26:44,203
<i># We're going to show</i>
<i>You how to rock it #</i>

1618
01:26:44,204 --> 01:26:46,372
<i># Off the hillbilly hook #</i>

1619
01:26:46,373 --> 01:26:48,273
<i># Get up, get up #</i>

1620
01:26:50,310 --> 01:26:53,045
<i># Get up, get up #</i>

1621
01:26:53,046 --> 01:26:54,513
<i># Yeah, yeah #</i>

1622
01:26:54,514 --> 01:26:57,116
<i># Get up, get up #</i>

1623
01:26:57,117 --> 01:26:58,951
<i># Oh-oh-oh #</i>

1624
01:26:58,952 --> 01:27:01,286
<i># Get up, get up #</i>

1625
01:27:16,703 --> 01:27:20,939
<i># Well, a man come on</i>
<i>The six o'clock news #</i>

1626
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:25,110
<i># Says somebody been shot</i>
<i>Somebody's been abused #</i>

1627
01:27:25,111 --> 01:27:29,081
<i># Somebody blew up a building</i>
<i>Somebody stole a car #</i>

1628
01:27:29,082 --> 01:27:33,252
<i># Somebody got away</i>
<i>Somebody didn't get too far #</i>

1629
01:27:33,253 --> 01:27:34,920
<i># Yeah #</i>

1630
01:27:34,921 --> 01:27:37,256
<i># They didn't get too far #</i>

1631
01:27:39,592 --> 01:27:43,829
<i># Grandpappy told my pappy</i>
<i>"Back in my day, son #</i>

1632
01:27:43,830 --> 01:27:47,533
<i># A man had to answer for</i>
<i>The wicked that he'd done" #</i>

1633
01:27:47,534 --> 01:27:51,370
<i># Take all the rope in Texas</i>
<i>Find a tall oak tree #</i>

1634
01:27:51,371 --> 01:27:57,242
<i># Round up all of them bad boys</i>
<i>Hang 'em high in the street #</i>

1635
01:27:57,243 --> 01:27:59,178
<i># For all the people to see #</i>

1636
01:28:01,815 --> 01:28:05,617

<i>You should always find #</i>

1637
01:28:05,618 --> 01:28:07,353
<i># You got to saddle</i>
<i>Up your boys #</i>

1638
01:28:07,354 --> 01:28:09,755
<i># You got to draw</i>
<i>A hard line #</i>

1639
01:28:09,756 --> 01:28:13,492
<i># When the gun smoke settles</i>
<i>We'll sing a victory tune #</i>

1640
01:28:13,493 --> 01:28:17,896

1641
01:28:17,897 --> 01:28:22,701

1644
01:28:33,346 --> 01:28:38,717
<i># We got too many gangsters</i>
<i>Doing dirty deeds #</i>

1645
01:28:38,718 --> 01:28:41,820
<i># Too much corruption</i>

1646
01:28:41,821 --> 01:28:44,089

1649
01:28:51,564 --> 01:28:54,133
