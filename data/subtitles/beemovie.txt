Hi, welcome
to the Bee Movie DVD commentary.



I'm here with the makers of the film,
directors, writers, producers, editors.



You're gonna meet them all
and get our impressions



of different things that we liked
and things we tried.



Some succeeded, some failed.



A bit of the inside world
of the making of the movie.



Hope you enjoy it.



I'm Barry Marder,
one of the co-writers on the Bee Movie.



- And...
- That's it.



That's all you got. Hello, I'm Simon
J Smith, director of Bee Movie.



I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
I'm the star of the movie.



Steven Hickner,
one of the directors of Bee Movie.



Christina Steinberg, the producer,
one of the producers on Bee Movie.



I'm Nick Fletcher, the editor.



This is my company, by the way,
Columbus 81 Productions.



- First time it's been in credits?
- First time it's ever onscreen.



- Fantastic.
- That's pretty great.



Want to talk about
that idea you had about the Frisbee?



That scene where
the Frisbee hits the hive.



- Right.
- I forgot that.



The movie used to begin
with a Frisbee hitting the hive...



- And all the bees...
...swing into action and sirens.



- They patched it up in ten seconds.
- We cut it because nobody laughed.



I love that inside Barry's home
everything's made of wax.



Combinations of wax and honey.
No other substance inside the hive.



It's either wax or honey.
And honey's good for everything.



You can put it in your car, petrol.
Put it on your cereal.



You can drink it, you can
eat it, you can fry it, cook it.



It's a very multi-purpose substance.



- I love that he does his hair there.
- That's some real Bert Convy hair.



- Barry's car looks like your car.
- It does. I have a car like that.



- Yeah.
- The way his car spins out there.



He had to. I made sure there
was a nice over-steer there.



- I like this shift.
- Yeah. Will put that in.



- There's lots of great little details.
- What does it say under "Frisbee hits"?



- "Internet down".
- What does it say under that?



- Can we go back?
- "Person heard a sound, then Wham-O."



Because Wham-O, of course,
being the company that makes Frisbee,



- we thought that was clever.
- What else do they make?



- That's it.
- They make Whee-Lo and Water Wiggle.



- Really?
- Steve would know.



- These have great sound effects too.
- Yeah.



Will Files, who's the sound designer,
with brilliant people



from Skywalker, did an amazing job.



This joke, I think,
is the oldestjoke in the movie.



- Really?
- Which I love.



- It has lasted from day one.
- In different places.



- We always wanted to save it.
- The squirrel joke.



- Over 212 scripts.
- It survived all of it.



One of my favourite things in the movie,
the bee Atlas holding up the flower.



With the globe in the middle
of the flower.



That was a good moment for you
when that was finished.



The character effects guys
did brilliant things, like the tassel.



- It was really lovely.
- That's Larry Miller.



- Yay!
- Dean Buzzwell, head of this college



that Barry goes to. Larry Miller does
such a good job at keeping enthusiasm



of Buzzwell, and how much
he loves working with honey.



The bees fit in with the
weight problem of today, don't they?



- Like teenagers...
- Don't know what you're talking about.



The first society
to have a weight problem.



The bees were the frontrunner of husky,
of children's husky.



Too much sugar.



It's the sugar, isn't it?
If they got rid of honey and sugar,



they would be slimmed down.



Wanna talk about the fight Barry
used to have with Buzzwell?



The movie used to open with Barry
interviewed for his job.



We should show that scene.



- It may be one of the extras.
- We can't stop the movie now.



We'll show it later.



- These are great colours.
- Yeah.



This sequence used to be an interview
with Barry. We settled on this.



And this is the first time
we've ever seen it all completed.



- First time watching this.
- With effects finished.



With everything finished in it,
graded and everything.



That wasn't finished
when we wrapped the movie.



No. It wasn't finished
when I was doing the grade either.



- No.
- There used to be an empty desk beat,



where the bees saw an empty desk.
They need to fill the job instantly.



"Empty desk!"



You never saw this
with the newspaper all finished.



Looks pretty good.



Fat free.



- That's funny.
- Good.



- The Urban Wife.
- Came out great.



- Is that what it's called?
- Yeah.



- I love the noise.
- How many iterations of the Krelman



- did we do?
- True. There used to not be bees on it.



- Yeah.
- Right.



My wife is pointing out to me
that you learn quite a bit



about a number of different things.



You learn about bees,
you learn about... kind of...



...kind of a biological interdependency
of the planet.



How insects and humans and animals
and produce all kind of work



and depend on each other.



It really wasn't anything that we,
you know, put in there.



We weren't trying to educate anybody,
but it was necessary for us



to tell our story to make these points.
We found ways of sliding it in



so the medicine goes down
with a little bit of sugar.



You don't even realise you're learning
about the world when you watch the film.



She was saying it's such a nice thing
for kids, that they learn something,



besides being entertained.



That was part of what we wanted
to try and do with Barry.



- Great.
- Form dissolve.



Nice little circle dissolve and wipe
from Star Wars.



This is the last scene we completed.
It was the most difficult one, remember?



- This was really tricky.
- Many, many versions.



"Bee goes berserk".



- I love that.
- "Stings seven, then self."



Stings self.



- "Then self".
- There used to be 1,000-tuplets.



- "Queen delivers 1,000-tuplets".
- This took a long time to get right.



- "Queen delivers 1,000-tuplets".
- This took a long time to get right.



This, too, was a leap of faith
because it was never completed.



That was in the storyboard
from the beginning, but we never had



what it was gonna look like.



There's the nice beauty shot
of your statue.



- Yeah.
- Here come the lads.



Those wicked sounds are from the P-51,
which was your idea, Jerry.



It was. The P-51 Mustang from WWII.



We plundered the vaults
of Saving Private Ryan,



'cause they'd shot a load of P-51s.
They had fantastic fly-bys.



Right. Look at all the different
wardrobes that each bee has.



We... There's over...



I think there's over
900 male costumes and 800...



No, 1,200 female costumes.



I've never seen this honey before.
It's fantastic.



- I'm glad you like it.
- That's a good sign.



The whole movie is an Elvis bee movie.



Every bee is kind of
an Elvis impersonator.



- With the sideburns.
- And heaviness and puffiness.



- That was '72, if I...
- Oh, God.



- '74, maybe.
- That's what a good comedian does.



He feels for the soft underbelly
of everything and sticks the knife in.



I'll get berated in the car for this.
How dare you...



Berated in the Car:
The Barry Marder Story.



People, when they talk to you,
inadvertently will say something



that should be the title
of their autobiography.



- Barry's will be Berated in the Car.
- Right.



- I love this bit.
- Yeah.



- The animation's fantastic.
- Yeah.



Adam's expression here
as he's being slapped...



- So funny.
- Thatjoke came out in the animation.



- A lot of slapping in this movie.
- There is.



- I love that as well.
- There's a new trailer they have on TV.



- It's all slapping.
- It's great.



- It's "Let the slap fest begin".
- Really?



It's just all slapping
in a 30-second spot. Slapping.



- It's really funny.
- With the mosquito.



- Everything. On the plane.
- There's a lot.



This looks like a bee Elvis convention.



- They're big fans of Elvis, the bees.
- Really?



Bee Elvis convention.



Bee Elvis convention.



- Here's this moment you like.
- Lovely shot.



Watch Barry's face here.



It's very subtle little acting
he's doing there.



Here's the Sam Levenson character.



- Another broad-based reference.
- No one knows who Sam Levenson is.



Voiced by the guy who directed Rain Man.



This is Barry Levinson.
My favourite line.



- Shameful.
- It is.



His mother is Kathy Bates, who's been
in Misery, About Schmidt, lots of stuff.



I love the parents' wardrobe. They're
the holdover from The Graduate idea.



We did open with a big part
of The Graduate.



- Remember this was a Graduate idea?
- Right.



The whole idea of bees driving
when they could fly is hilarious to me.



- Constant driving, too.
- The cars are so cute.



- Who designed the cars?
- We did.



- Yeah.
- I love "hair removal".



Who snuck that in?



- "Swatting counsellor".
- "Inspector number seven".



- What is inspector 7?
- Restroom attendant.



People still try to figure out
what that means.



- Yeah.
- "Not for the reason you think".



- Yeah.
- Matthew's good in that scene.



- Yeah.
- The animation was lovely.



Don't know of any job where you work in
a bathroom, take a break, you come out.



- Now you do.
- I'm doing stand-up 91.



- This is John Hill, he did this.
- Johnny Hill did that.



Everyone was worried
we were mentioning death too much.



People tried to make us cut that out
and we left it in.



- Added more.
- Added references to death.



When the note was "too much mention
of death", we added ten more.



That was a trend. Every time
they were worried, we added more.



About five times more.



Another big problem
we have in this film is...



...is overly defined buttocks.



- There's way too many buttocks...
- We fixed that.



- We fixed some of them, not all.
- We fixed the women.



There are people in this movie
wearing very tight pants



with a very tight, very low rise



and a seam that goes right up their
posterior that makes me uncomfortable.



Rip Torn had tremendous energy
whenever we recorded.



He's a great guy.



- A bottomless well of enthusiasm.
- And he has a huge amount of energy



and you can see it in his acting
and his voice performance.



What kind of bee can grow a moustache?



- Very specific one.
- There's two bees with moustaches.



Bob Bumble and Lou Lo Duca.



"Bears and bats".



Lou Lo Duca.



- Why would a bee grow a moustache?
- Why not?



- Why would anyone grow a moustache?
- That's true.



- Why do you need hair under your nose?
- You had for 15 years. Enlighten us.



- Until I wised up.
- You had a moustache?



- I'd love to see you with a moustache.
- Why am I growing hair under my nose?



- What's the deal with that?
- Must be a funky smell all day long.



- Like old clothes.
- That's what I said.



- Can we mention the music?
- Yes.



- Sure.
- This is one of the best bits we have.



- I love this.
- The build-up to them leaving the hive.



I love their boots. Get a look
at those boots that they have.



You were very specific about those
when we were in vis stuff.



- They look cool.
- Great sound effects too.



- Great scene right here.
- Yeah.



Yes.



"Pound those petunias,
you striped stem suckers."



- I love that boom down.
- It's a good line.



- I love this guy.
- How can you not laugh on stem-sucker?



I advertised for that once.



So many people mention
how much they love the flying.



I know. This moment is where
so many people are blown away.



- That painting is fantastic.
- Matte painting is so beautiful here.



I think from the first time I read it,
I imagined this as a rollercoaster ride.



But this shot is so gorgeous.



We added the kites to give
a sense of speed when he flies.



It was also really pretty.
A sense of wonderment.



This part, flying with the bees,
all of it, right?



That purple is nice.



- I don't know why that makes me laugh.
- Really just filling time.



Purple is nice.



- I advertised for that.
- How do you like green, Barry?



Green, I'm not crazy about.



- I love the bee vision.
- Yeah.



I love the insignia on their jacket,
bee insignia we came up with.



There's different divisions of the bees.



- This was a note that Steven gave us.
- That's true.



Remember, this whole explaining science
of pollination came from Spielberg.



Hand of Steven Spielberg in here.



Sprinkling the magic.



This is our explanation
of pollination is



- coming up.
- It was a great note.



The writer, Andy Robin,
supplies the voice for the Pollen Jock.



- He did a greatjob.
- After many tries.



This took about...



All the effects crew doing animation
and things with pollen and flowers.



Nol Meyer, cinematographer,
did a brilliantjob of making it



feel like we're flying with these guys.



There used to be a fish here
thatjumped up...



- The storyboard.
- Right.



"Watch your bass."



- "Watch your bass."
- That added, what, script 128?



- I think it was 132.
- Added earlier.



Before that, there was a blue jay
at 3.00 that attacked Barry.



- We cut that...
- We had five Cary Grant references.



- We did.
- Where did they all go?



You can imagine where they went, Barry.



Hidden.



This was great, the music here
with the outer space idea.



- That Theremin.
- Yeah.



The other world.



Sounds like Simon's phone.



You could really even smell
the tennis balls here.



- I love the line "chemically".
- That's Andy Robin.



'Cause they do have that chemical smell.



Very unnatural.



This animation is amazing.



- This idea...
- And purple is great.



...of making these
tennis players, Ken and Vanessa,



came from you, Simon,
that very first meeting.



- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.



Having Vanessa and Ken
be the tennis players?



The very first meeting.



- Before, it used to be just two people.
- It's much more fun



having these guys here, I think.



That turned out so great.
Great moment.



This scene, we probably shot
about the most footage for any scene.



I was gonna say, this was in layout for,
I think, 12 months.



A year it was in what we call layout,



the animatic stage of production,
for about a year.



Trying... We shot a lot of footage.
The layout crew did an amazing job.



We balled it down.
It was three times as long.



Then the human world, we tried
to make very sharp and right angles



as a contrast, that the humans
and especially Manhattan



is a very rectilinear kind of place.



The city is laid out on a grid,
the buildings are square,



everything has a sharp edge to it.



- This shot came in late.
- I was desperate for this shot.



- Great little sound effects.
- I know.



Yeah. Skywalker had a field day.



We had a great, good laugh
doing the Foley for this.



- Got a good rhythm to it.
- Yeah.



- This, I love the sound here.
- Yeah.



She turns on the radio,
he's sucked through the vent.



- I don't know how that works.
- But New York won.



- Right.
- That's...



- That is Olivia Mattingly, my daughter.
- That's right.



And Ken Morrissey's son
plays the little boy.



- One of the storyboard artists.
- Really?



- This is a late joke as well.
- I know, and a great addition.



- One of my favourite shots.
- Great shot.



This has been in the movie
for a long time.



That's the wonderful Patrick Warburton.



Ken used to be selling Ziamonique,
which was a fake diamond substitute.



We called him Ken
because he's kind of like the Ken doll,



which is this prototypical male figure,



and very stiff, very, you know,
kind of unreal in a way.



Hitting the light bulb, "I don't
remember the sun having a 75 on it",



- that was one of the oldest lines.
- That came from...



That came later,
"These are winter boots".



I love this shot because it keeps us
in the mind of Barry. We don't cut.



This was always one of the best scenes
that we've always had in the movie.



- This is one of the longest.
- That's a cute shot.



I love this reaction he does here.



Right here.



That's a little animation thing
that's hard to get.



- The acting was good in this scene.
- It's great.



- I love this bit.
- Yeah.



The animation's fantastic.



This was another one
of our things that we like.



This look on Barry's face
as she saves his life.



This is really where the movie
kind of clicks into gear.



When this relationship begins.



Jerry, I remember
when you added that little bit



where you wanted him to be hanging on
to the brochure and linger there.



We kept referring back to that.



- We need to get the guy in the glass.
- "Guy in the glass", we kept saying.



Movie's about the guy in the glass.



"Knocking somebody out
is also a special skill."



That's funny.



That was one of our best transitions.



Oh, yeah, following that drop.



I got some of, I think, the...



...the Honex door thing was great.



One of the hardest things in animation,
I learned in this process, is walking.



It's difficult for animators
to get characters



to look like they're walking
realistically.



It think it's easier with Barry,
but you get all the weight transfer



and the joints...
There's so much to it.



They really struggle with it.



One of the things I remember...
Just kind of a funny moment,



in the early phases of making the movie,



they give you the timeline.
They tell you this was,



whatever it was, spring of 2004.



They say the movie's gonna come out
in 2007, which sounds very Orwellian.



You just go, "It'll never be 2007."



I remember when
we were designing Vanessa.



We were trying to figure out the type
of girl she should be.



We came up with this hairstyle.
Somebody drew this hairstyle



and we all liked that.
I remember thinking to myself,



"Who knows what women
are gonna look like in 2007?



They could be totally different."
I was really surprised



that clothes and hair
don't look old-fashioned.



They are four years old. "Girls won't
wear their hair like that in 2007."



- I remember that.
- It was like the millennium.



"Maybe we'll have flying cars by then."



- Science fiction movies.
- We were supposed to have flying cars



- by the year 2000.
- Yeah. There you go.



This was the first scene
that we animated.



Yes.



I think also... This little segment,



from when Barry lands on the window
sill through the next couple of scenes,



was the first scenes we boarded,
and once we saw it storyboarded



and edited, we got excited.
After that point...



Also, when Jerry recorded with Renée,



- that was a huge breakthrough.
- Yeah.



Fantastic feeling
between Jerry and Renée.



It was lovely. We knew we had the
gold in the movie, the relationship.



It felt like a movie
when we saw this relationship.



You bought it,
you realised they could be friends.



When Renée came to the recording,
she had that idea



that playing Vanessa as a young version
of Ruth Gordon's character Maude



- in Harold and Maude.
- She was terrific.



If somebody could make friends
with a bee this easily and quickly,



it would be her.



They always laugh when we cut
to that scene on the sheet.



I don't know what they're laughing at.



You know, on that cut,
it always gets a laugh.



I think it's because they're
listening to you telling a joke.



- It's familiar and makes them happy.
- I've never understood that.



I love thatjoke.



This is a little moment we added
towards the end to make sure we catch on



resetting the audience
for Barry's character, where he was



- in his mind.
- That he wanted to do what was right,



- but couldn't do it.
- He cared about something.



You weren't sure
how he was gonna do that.



Immediately, as soon as you see them
together and hear them talk together,



you go, "They seem like friends.
I believe they're friends."



That's one of the most fun things
in the movie. You don't question



a bee-human friendship.



We tried to do a bunch of stuff
with this mechanic in the background.



I love that line, "You're not gonna
jump?" There was no place to fit it in.



I think it's another thing about death
that people didn't want us to do.



He was like,
"Too many suicide and death jokes."



Too many leaps off a building
in the movie.



- I love that too.
- This is terrific animation.



A joke by Chuck Martin.
"I'd be up the rest of my life."



Yeah, lovely.



Can we talk about
the alteration we made?



- Sure.
- We did have Vanessa taking a crumb



from the corner of her mouth.



But it looked like she put her finger
in her mouth to remove something



and it made everybody
feel slightly uncomfortable.



- It looked unsavoury.
- That was the intention. I did want it



to be a more intimate connection.
She would take something



from her lip and hand it to him.
I thought that would be exciting.



- This was on her lip a second ago.
- For a young bee.



- This was on her lip a second ago.
- For a young bee.



Right. But no matter how we tried it,
we animated that three times,



it always made people feel weirded out.



We changed it to... It was a wise
choice, with the finger on the...



We had a lot of bee testing things here.



The only two that made it
were the fly swatter and this one.



Look at the way the floor
reflects like a mirror.



This movie was challenging
because there's so many crowd shots.



There's about 70 percent crowd shots.



There's bees flying around,
operating equipment,



there's a lot of bees. Everybody did
an amazing job of making that happen.



That machine in the back we called the
pachinko. This one is the taffy puller.



- Centrifuges there.
- What's this one called?



- Squeegee guy.
- Squeegee guy. Diver Dan. Squeegee guy.



Those are honey vats
with different types of honey.



Look at the cups
with the honey water cooler.



Vending machine with honey.
There used to be a fax joke.



- Remember the fax joke?
- Oh, yeah.



That's why the fax machine
in the bottom right-hand corner...



Adam used to get a fax.
His antenna would ring



and then he would kind of squat.
His stinger would fax out a message



- on the paper.
- I believe it was...



- It was Bongiorno's Pizza.
- Yeah.



- There was a junk fax.
- "Oh, it's just a junk fax."



- I love this bee on the bottom left.
- I love the noise of...



What's he doing, playing a slot machine?



This sounds like noises from
Billion Dollar Brain or something.



This is a good moment to talk about
Jerry, what used to be a musical number.



Right. Here's where they surround Barry



and start going, "Start thinking bee."



It sounds like a musical number here.



It sounds like a musical number
starting. There was a number in there



that kind of threw the tone of the movie
off track. We had to lose that too.



What's great is we have you and Matthew
at the end credits.



You guys were great together singing.



You can hear us singing if you wait
till the end of the credits,



which are eight minutes long.



- Marc Shaiman wrote the song.
- Right.



- Shaiman from Hairspray.
- Very good song.



This worked really well, the transition.



- A great idea.
- The best transition,



from this fizzy bubble, then
his sweater appears, the wings appear.



Wanna talk about The Graduate, your
idea at the beginning, him in the pool?



Right. The Graduate is my favourite
movie. I thought this could be,



thematically, we could do
a lot of references to The Graduate.



He's running off at night to see this
person he's not supposed to be seeing.



Did I tell you? I didn't tell you guys.
I told you.



Some day, the other day, I was...
When I exercise,



I listen to satellite radio.
I listen to hits of the '70s.



Yeah, you told me.



I'll tell you why I listen
to hits of the '70s.



Because in 1970,



I was a kid sitting in tenth grade
in high school.



And in 1979, I was
on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.



So that ten years of my life



I think of as the biggest thing
that ever happened to me.



Anyway, so they were playing
the hits of '69 this week.



And there were
all these fantastic songs.



Then they go, "Coming up,
the number one song



this week in 1969."



- It was when we got our first review.
- Yes, it was the same day.



- It was when we got our first review.
- Yes, it was the same day.



Same day we got
our first review of the movie.



What was the number one song
of 1969 this week?



- Winchester Cathedral?
- Close.



- Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head?
- Close.



- Wait, don't tell us.
- Sugar, Sugar?



What about the whole hive disorder that
suddenly appeared in the real world?



- And then it somehow...
- Colony collapse disorder



appeared a couple of years
into us making the movie,



and it was already our story
that the bees stopped working



after they won all
the honey in the trial.



So that had to be... That and us
bumping into Ray Liotta on 57th Street



and him saying, "Put me in the movie",
and me saying, "Yeah, sure",



and then us ending up actually
doing that, that and hive disorder



as we were making the movie
were the two freakiest things



- that occurred.
- Strange coincidences.



Didn't think you'd put him in.
He heard about the movie,



read that the movie was being done,
these people were in it,



and said, "I can't believe
Jerry didn't put me in."



Then we decided we needed... Let's
have an actor like a Paul Newman guy,



who's got a food line, but make him
a guy who's kind of on the down slide



to make it funny.
And who would be funny?



First you got to find a celebrity that's
got a sense of humour about himself,



which is not so easy either. And then...



It came down to just there's only a
couple of guys that can play that part.



We were thrilled to get Ray
and he was...



- He's hilarious.
- He's hilarious.



Also, he came in, remember,



- it was in this studio.
- It was here.



He came in here and read
and, I mean, his shirt was soaked



by the end of the session
'cause he just gave you 111 percent.



It was really the most exciting thing
for me sometimes, when actors came in.



- John Goodman was like that.
- You and Chris.



Certainly Rip Torn.
Rip Torn was like that. Patrick.



I remember with Patrick, most of the
time you were on the floor laughing.



Let's talk about that for a second
as my penchant



- for autobiography titles.
- Oh, yes.



I tried to give everyone I know...
I feel people, when they talk to you,



inadvertently say something that should
be the title of their autobiography.



Nick Fletcher, our gifted editor, and...



...cinematic mastermind...



One of the things you do in editing
is you'll hear a line,



and go, "I don't like
the way the actor says that."



Each time you make changes. You say
do this, do that. He has to sit there



and assemble this whole thing. It's
just this mind-numbing jigsaw puzzle.



Anyway, I come in after he's done all
this work. I go, "I don't like the way



the guy says that line. Let me hear
the other takes, other versions of it.



That's not a good read on that."
One of them that we had



was of Freddy,
who was the head of the apiary.



So the scene is that they're shuttling



schoolchildren through the apiary,
through the Honey Farms apiary,



- charging them up the wazoo.
- Forty dollars.



For, like, a three-minute tour.



We get the honey, we put it in jars,
slap the label on it, pure profit,



which survived into this version.



They get rid of the kids.
The kids go, "That's the whole thing?"



"Yeah, that's it. Enjoy your four-hour
ride home on that stinking bus."



So I said to Nick, "Do you have any
other versions of 'stinking bus'?"



Nick, what did you say?



I said I got 57 takes.



Which he really did, 'cause we
worked it to death there in New York.



He said, "I have..." It wasn't 57.
The actual number was...



- It was like 36 takes.
- "I have 36 takes of 'stinking bus."'



I go, "That's the title
of your autobiography."



- Thirty-six Takes...
- 36 Takes of Stinking Bus:



- Nick Fletcher Story.
- What about Steve's autobiography?



It's They Call Me Ma'am. Steve cuts
his hair in a very distinctive fashion.



We've never been able to figure out how
Steve gets professional hair cutters



to do this to his hair.



But anyway, throughout his life,
waiters and various...



- Police officers.
...servant people...



- Stewardesses.
...stewardesses constantly



confuse his gender and say,
"Ma'am, could you put your seat back up?



We're about to land." He looks up,
they go, "I didn't realise."



- Sometimes they don't!
- Yeah.



I've been on a flight where they
call me "ma'am" the whole ten hours.



Here's the beauty part of the story:
He doesn't mind it.



That's the weird part of the story.
He's a confirmed heterosexual,



happily married for 25 years.



When he's out with his wife, they say,
"Would you ladies like coffee?"



That happens all the time.



So anyway, then we came upon
the title of Steve's autobiography,



They Call Me Ma'am:
The Steve Hickner Story.



This was in the script
from the very beginning.



- The very first one, wasn't it?
- Yes.



I laughed out loud
when I read this.



This was one of my favourites
when I read the script.



This made me want to do the movie.
Oh, that's me.



That's Simon, in the baseball hat.



- There I am again.
- Barry, but he doesn't speak.



You don't get paid for this one, Barry.



- Could it be me, though?
- No, it can't.



- It's not the same model, is it?
- His twin brother.



Same model,
it may be different surfacing.



Supposed to change
the colour of that sweater.



So when is lunch? As Christina
will tell you, I will work like a mule,



- but I like to know when lunch is.
- That's what you work towards.



- That's what I work towards.
- "Let me finish."



After this, lunch will be coming.



- So pay one notice.
- People like coffee and cake.



It seems to go...
It's like potato salad and cole slaw.



- Really just got together.
- Not even close to salad and slaw.



Coffee and cake is at the top
of the human food pyramid



- of greatest combinations ever.
- Don't think potato salad and slaw?



- Chocolate and coffee?
- Salad and slaw, pick one or the other.



Potato salad and cole slaw to me
is like a blind date that worked out.



We're having roast beef, would you like
potato salad and cole slaw also?



Itjust seems to go.



Comparing potato salad and cole slaw
to coffee and cake.



Potato salad and slaw is the
greatest combination together



- in history.
- If I had a phone dial,



I would hit the five button now.



No. Coffee and cake
is one of the ultimate human inventions.



Potato salad and cole slaw
are drippy, wet...



When you hear we're having roast beef,
we must have potato salad and cole slaw.



- No. No one says that.
- No.



The amount of evil laughing
from the evil beekeepers is excellent.



Yeah, this is another thing that we...
We apologise for being fans of the film.



If it's obnoxious, we're sorry. But...



But anyway, one of the funny things here
is that we portrayed these beekeepers



as kind of like tobacco company
executives. Really mercenary



and heartless. But the fact
is these people in real life



are the sweetest...
They're like hippies, old hippies.



- They love bees!
- The only ones who care for bees.



They're the only ones that care
about bees and we turn them...



- Look at the face.
- Can't wait to get his payload.



- How about how cool that shot was?
- I love the photo of the two of them



- that comes in a bit.
- Later, we compare them to Enron.



- That's right.
- Yeah.



- That's how thoughtful we are.
- Right.



Look. That doesn't look like Elvis.



It sort of does with the collar.
A sort of Vegas collar.



I can't believe we got "drag queen"
into the final cut.



- Yes.
- That's my biggest surprise of this.



I would have thought someone...
It's a bit...



I wouldn't call that
a family-oriented...



- PG.
- It's somebody who...



That what makes it PG, joke like that?



- Probably.
- Yes.



We had this scene re-written 100 times.



- This was a retirement village...
- We originally created this world.



We were gonna do a Florida condo gag.
We were gonna make it that these bees



were living in a Florida
condo-type environment.



My friend, Sacha Baron Cohen, who
you might know as the character Borat,



watched a screening of the movie.
He said, "I didn't understand



why it was bad that the bees
were stuck in these apiaries.



It didn't look so bad to me."
It was kind of all Formica



and prefab housing.



Because of him, we changed it
to this very... What would you call it?



...downgraded look of the wood...
- Like a work camp.



- Like a Russian tenement block.
- Right.



- POW camp looking.
- They were gonna build



- a bee outlet mall.
- They would say, "We like it here.



- There's a tram. Dinner theatre.
- Dinner theatre.



We saw a bee doing a moth impression
last night. I don't like that humour.



- But he was funny."
- Slapstick humour.



Chewing and biting on the arm.



I saw a very funny Onion
Barry and I have been laughing about.



I always stop at the little box on the
sidewalk. The front page is great.



The headline is,
"Piping hot calzone missing".



Then they have the quote
from the person which is,



"Who would do something like this?"



- What was that from?
- The Onion.



- Hilarious.
- Hilarious magazine.



"Who would do something like this?"
It's such an ugly crime.



- Stealing a calzone.
- Piping hot.



They always have things like that,
the small things of life as headlines.



- "Man's striped shirt stolen".
- Yeah.



This idea is one of our favourite...



This is what we call a writers' room
joke that made it into the movie.



Normally, you come up with the idea
of, "Let's have Barry go on



a Larry King in the bee hive." Let's
say there's Larry King in the hive.



Normally, you go,
"OK, that's funny. Let's do that."



You come up with another name
for the character.



You don't say...
You don't use the real name.



So the joke here for us
was that we're so lazy,



we didn't even bother to come
with a phoney Larry King-type name,



whatever that would be.
Larry Hive King or something.



We just called him Bee Larry King.



The idea of that being in any
conceivable universe that you'd create



there would be a Larry King,
like any universe would have to have



some sort of carbon,
hydrogen and oxygen,



- you would have to have Larry King.
- It'd be like Moth Tommy Lee.



You'll notice that this mug Barry's
holding is a continuity error.



It's in the sequence preceding this.



- Somehow Barry got the mug.
- Adam has the mug when he's packing.



- They all have the mug.
- But that's later!



- It's possible he could have it.
- It's the only mug we could afford.



- It's in every scene.
- A lot of stuff had to go in this.



We had to move quickly.



It's funny that even kids
know Larry King.



At all the previews, like,
the six year olds know who he is.



He's on in everybody's house.
I think the show is the dots.



I don't think people care who's there.



Nick, when you put
that thing there on the bottom.



- That was Nick's joke, wasn't it?
- Yeah.



That was a greatjoke,
putting that crawl on the bottom.



- "Barry says".
- I didn't see how we could not do that.



You can try a lot of differentjokes.



"Why is yogurt night so difficult?"
We tried many different lines.



So funny.



- It is what you see.
- Ken looks like...



...he has some gigantism in the face.



Gigantism!



- It's a caricature.
- Itjust looks like...



- What we call a pushed character.
- Yes.



- It's stylised.
- Weird stylism.



This was many different lines
because it's on his back.



We used to make fun
of other animated movies that had...



I don't know the term. They
would shoot 150 percent of the movie.



Let's explain that to the audience.
Let's say the movie is 80 minutes long.



In many cases, the movie you watch,
there's another 40 minutes of material



that's been cut, you don't see.
Or another whole movie, in some cases.



What they say...
I'll wrap this up in a second.



What they would say is that...



They made 200 percent of that movie to
talk about the beating the budget took.



But this movie, in terms of ideas
that were tried and tossed...



- Is about three movies.
- At least 300 or 400 percent.



- In storyboard form...
- Remember Willingham?



- That was so great.
- It was a story idea, at one point,



at the end of the movie,
that Bee Larry King would meet up



with real Larry King on the USS Arizona
in New York Harbour.



It would be a Japanese surrender scene.



- I loved that scene.
- They had an argument.



Larry, when we recorded,
had an argument with himself.



He had an argument
with real Larry King. Yeah.



This is a joke that never...
I love this car.



This car is designed
by Grant Larson of Porsche.



- Really?
- He's a friend of mine.



- Look at the detail on the boots.
- I love those crocodile boots.



Those are Elvis boots.



- This is...
- Remember the joke we had here?



Yeah, remember that? Itjust died.
Remember?



- Yeah.
- Willingham in here?



"I've never had the chilli burger."



We used to have Willingham
on the front steps talking to the grip.



"Do you know who I am? I'm Willingham."



"I'm the world expert on bees."



The grip says to him,
"You missed the talking."



"I had my suspicions."



Quite a few heavy people in the movie.



Guess what, Barry?
There's quite a few heavy people period.



In this room, perhaps.



I said to Barry, "Notice there's
a lot of fat guys on motorcycles?"



When one of us says something stupid
on the phone, the other hits



one of the keys. Like "foul".



He says, "There's quite
a few heavy people, period.



It's not motorcycles."



Fat guys in cars, fat guys walking,
fat guys on planes.



- Fat guy with you right now.
- There's two.



Two fat guys with you now.



You're not fat guys.



I'll have the helicopter leaning...



So the other day this scene was playing
on the Oprah, when I was doing Oprah.



- I told you this story.
- You didn't.



Julian, my son, is four.



This scene comes on,
Barry starts doing...



- He just busts out laughing.
- Really?



- I was really excited.
- That is great.



That makes kids laugh.
I don't know what he thinks that is.



- Thought it was hilarious.
- Is he two?



- Four.
- Four.



- He's never seen the movie?
- No.



All I have is the commercials.
Four of those 30-second...



Olivia loves it. She gets excited
when it comes on. She screams.



Everyone runs to the TV.



Why do you think that is?
'Cause it's Mommy's



- or she likes it?
- It's both.



- It looks funny. She laughs.
- Right.



Let's talk about our idea
of how the court system works.



From the moment, the very beginning,



the moment it starts, the jury's hung.



- It would have been a mistrial.
- The moment...



The jury makes it very clear
where they stand.



They let you know. And after
the trial is done, the judge...



There's a jury, but for some reason,
the judge calls it.



- Gets very excited...
- "Let's save time with deliberations,



let's call it what it is."



"I know where you're going here."



This character's played by my friend,
Tom Papa, who's talented.



- Stand-up comedian.
- I heard there's quite a few...



- Also a Pollen Jock.
- Quite a few humans



look like Michael Buffer.



- Who's that?
- Who's Michael Buffer?



Barry is so caught up in this world
of him and his brother living



in this apartment in Toluca Lake.
He makes jokes only his brother gets.



They sit there and watch boxing
every Friday and Saturday night on HBO.



Michael Buffer
is one of the ring announcer guys.



This is a great Simon Smith joke,
where the bear, once he's told



it's over, gives up his performance.



He's not really a mean bear.
He's just putting it on.



Just a shill bear.



- Shill bear.
- There's a lot...



- Huge laugh.
- Sting. He was a good sport.



- So great.
- Sting was great.



I love it when he came in to record.
He was wearing his see-through tank.



- He looked attractive.
- Very handsome.



He's in great shape.



He's in great shape, kids,
just so you know.



- He was great, though.
- Look at that puffed hair he has.



- Yes.
- It's like GI Joe glued-on hair.



That GI Joe With Lifelike Hair.
Kung Fu Grip, that guy.



We love that Ray Liotta
carries his Emmy around.



By the way, Ray Liotta
actually does have an Emmy



- for a guest spot on ER in 2005.
- He corrected us while recording.



- We didn't make that up.
- It's true.



- This guy is a fantastic comedy actor.
- Comedy actor, dramatic actor...



- And a great sport.
- Great sport. Really.



What kind of outrageous show business
crime is it that he doesn't have



- an Oscar for Goodfellas?
- It is.



- One of the best performances ever.
- That's why awards are you know what.



I like when he's standing on the podium
at the end like a lunatic.



- "Say it."
- "Say it!"



This guy in the middle really
kind of becomes... steals the whole...



He becomes the jury foreman,
self-appointed jury foreman.



He becomes the jury foreman,
self-appointed jury foreman.



- I don't like that guy.
- Security guy,



trying to keep everybody down.



This gets a laugh, Little Missy logo.



At one point, Barry's gonna take that
salt next to him, put it on his pea,



- but we never actually did that.
- Here comes that gigantic head again.



I can't believe somehow we found a way
to work giantism into this whole



DVD commentary.



- Gigantism.
- Gigantism, yeah.



- This was a joke that came in later.
- Yes.



I couldn't let go of this tragic doomed
love triangle thing.



Another great Patrick thing.



- This was... Patrick was great in this.
- Yeah.



- One of my favourite scenes.
- A lot of us, our favourite.



I love the interplay
between the two of them.



That little...



- Patrick's great.
- Yeah.



To me, what I love about this movie,



is that he has got himself,
in his life, this Ken,



in a problem where a bee
is trying to steal his girl.



He thinks that. In his mind.



You never know what happens,
but who ends up in this situation?



- Where you've got an insect...
- Dating your girlfriend.



- What I like.
- Talking, now having dinner.



He's just trying to fill a resume out
at Kinko's, now he's got this problem.



Who figures an insect is gonna derail



their relationship, their career?



I love Barry picking
the piece of paper up.



Barry taking the reading material,
and being able to close the door.



- Who knows how that works?
- Turn the light on, right.



Simon and I think this
is our favourite line in the movie.



"You know what?"



- That take was so great.
- Which line?



He comes in the bathroom
and says, "You know what?"



He's happy that he's finally
got a reason to kill him.



He's got the excuse he needed,
in his mind. A clear conscience.



- Barry Marder moment's coming up.
- Yeah!



- Anticipation for that.
- Look at texture on that toilet paper.



- This is where...
- Yeah, I remember that took a while.



I remember fighting with the enemy.



- Guy gets hit on the head 64 times.
- Oh, Barry.



- Bravo!
- Very nice.



See, there's no here.



- No what?
- No word "here".



It's "Water bug. Not taking sides".



- Doesn't say "Not taking sides here".
- Write up a cheque for $5.60.



- Send it to Barry's apartment.
- I like when he says "blue water".



It's "poo water".



- I thought it was "blue water".
- Poo water!



- Poo water.
- Let me hear that again.



- No.
- Coming up.



- See?
- Who'd go, "Blue water"?



- Blue water's a toilet bowl refresher.
- True.



- The Tidy Bowl.
- What sick relationship is this?



Which one?



Everybody here take one step
to the right for a sick relationship.



Girl likes bee, bee likes girl.
This guy's trying to steal my baby.



- This was another late addition.
- Yes, one of my favourite moments.



- So funny.
- Two exits or three?



- Three.
- Two comebacks.



This is always one of the best scenes
that we've always had in the movie.



This is one of the longest.



- This was a tough one.
- It was.



- But you always, Jerry, had wanted...
- I wanted John Goodman for this.



This guy's great too, Sammy Davis Juror.



This guy's great too, Sammy Davis Juror.



- Sammy Davis Juror.
- Sammy Davis Juror.



- Another obese guy in the back.
- Montgomery with a moustache.



- Let's be honest.
- Not much variation you can get.



Not Montgomery.
There's a bunch of crowd guys we had.



Every other human has a weight problem.



But what kind of huge food company
executive has a Frito Bandito moustache?



Going into the moustaches.



- Our moustache problem.
- Facial hair taken out of the movie.



Still, quite a bit remains.



- Everybody had a moustache.
- Why do we need liver spots?



- Is that helping anybody?
- It's realistic.



- Here's your buttocks scene you...
- Here it comes.



- This is in full glory here.
- Prepare for this.



- This is very unappealing.
- This is full glory here.



I know, but it's unappealing
in an appealing way.



- In an appealing way?
- They're trying to make it



an attractive derriere
in a gigantic size.



I wanna be honest. Someone
in America will find that attractive.



Here, look at this.



I think that's fantastic.



- I love the little twitches.
- Yeah.



- People seem to like that tableau.
- Look at the newscaster and nurse.



- Same face, character.
- Newscaster is Carol Leifer.



Right, Carol Leifer, good friend
of mine. Talented comedian and writer.



- I love this music.
- This music is fantastic.



Did it in one take.
One take, one whole take. Phenomenal.



That got a good laugh,
him hitting the clicker thing.



Look at the drooping antenna
'cause he's not feeling well.



- And little magazines.
- Graded him less than Barry, he's ill.



- The end of the scene, he gets better.
- A little perkier.



This is great.



We also had a flea circus here
along with a roach motel.



- Which I always liked.
- What was it? Flea circus, roach motel?



- Ant farms.
- Flea circuses, ant farms.



"Ant farms,
flea circuses, roach motels,



they're capable of anything."
Never got a laugh.



- "Look what they did to fleas."
- "Look what they did to fleas."



- That gets a big laugh.
- That's what remains of that



three-partjoke.



- The smoke is a good effect.
- It is, it's great.



- Perfect. Subtle.
- This is where we make our anti-smoking



- statement.
- You can smoke into a hospital room.



- You wouldn't think.
- They used to be doctors.



- Right.
- Smoking outside the window.



- That was too real.
- Considering the size of the



medical assistants, how heavy they are,
when they swivel around.



In the meantime, they don't look
in the window and go, "Is that two bees



in one of our hospital rooms?
What the hell's going on in this place?"



- This worked.
- Yeah.



- That guy is very proud in the back.
- Yeah. The guy making the boat.



Puttering along.



- They could have gone...
- You questioned the bee thing once.



- That was the MetLife jacket thing.
- Right.



When I said that, you said...
You got mad, berated me,



and said a bee wouldn't wear a Metlife
jacket. I went, "The bee attorney?"



This is a sight gag



- that came out later in the process.
- Where is Montgomery's jacket?



- Why is he not wearing a jacket?
- He couldn't do it with the seat.



- We couldn't make it work.
- That thing on his neck.



It looks like he's been to hospital
and had some problems.



This whole structure here of having no
smoking gun was Steve Hickner's idea.



Having Barry produce the gun and come
in. That really was a great addition.



- The smoking gun.
- How did we not think of that sooner?



- It used to be the queen.
- Every good idea seems so obvious.



- How could you not do it?
- How you know it's good.



We eradicated the bees
eight times in this movie.



That way that guy
slides across the table,



if you watch the way his eyes
go from side to side,



the way he... See? The little grimace
he does with his teeth,



you have to work
on that whole little thing.



That other little gesture, that's
from my sitcom, that Newman thing



we used to do. I used to go, "Newman!"



Barry, why don't you talk for a second
about why you like that line



when Montgomery
comes over to Barry and says,



"You'll regret this, Benson.
This is an unholy perversion



of the balance of nature.
You'll regret this."



Talk a little bit about what that line
does in terms of the story structure



of the movie.



I like that line because, to me,
what's funny about this movie,



the big core funny thing
is that a bug would sue a human.



It's like a cockroach suing
a construction worker.



When you get that in there...
He comes over and says,



"This is gonna throw off the balance",
that is something I didn't expect



in this movie. It takes that movie
from being a funny movie



to, "There's a real problem
that could happen here", you know?



And itjust hit me like...
This went to...



In a good screenplay,
it's get that character up a tree,



- then you got to get him down.
- Right.



This sequence is the best it's been
because we had it like a smorgasbord



of events happening
on top of each other.



- Then was it Steven?
- It was Steven.



- He split the two things up.
- Tell this story.



The flowers dying first
and then the bees not working second.



Collecting the honey, the flowers dying,
and then bees chilling out.



- We had it...
- We had them all...



Many times, we tried to make it work.
I think the way it is now, obviously,



is the honey is rounded up,
they collect all the honey,



then they stop working
because they don't need any more honey.



They stop working,
the flowers start dying.



- Really clear.
- It's cause and effect.



- Cause and effect. We didn't have that.
- Jumbled it together.



We tried to make it work
and it wasn't blending.



One of your great ideas, Jerry,
was putting them sunbathing.



Somehow that says idleness.
We never could get that visual.



- It's not total boredom.
- "Gallons more's coming".



"Gallons more's coming".
That was Dave Herman.



It was his first take of that line.
He screwed it up.



He said "more's" instead
of "Gallons more coming".



We thought it was funny
so we left it in.



I love the James Bond-style music.



- The War Games moment.
- Yeah.



- Yeah, a little...
- For Matthew's fans.



- I like the way they move here.
- I love the music here too.



- I like the way it becomes a TV image.
- The guy looks like The Village People.



I never noticed the Honex corporate
shirt that guy was wearing.



- I love this scene.
- I love this scene.



Saw that the first time last night.
The way it was animated...



- Which one?
- They're in the chaise lounges.



- It's chaise, by the way.
- Chave lounge?



Ever say it again,
which I doubt, but if you ever do.



I love this effect.
They thought this was gonna be hard.



This is a huge,
fantastic thing they did.



- Chevy Chase would be...
- The day-night?



The day-night is a huge thing.
Everybody did a fantastic job on it.



There's so many huge undertakings
in this movie.



- That's something Nick put in.
- Nick put that in.



- Adam growing a quarter of an inch?
- Yeah.



Adam looks awfully big there.



- Just the camera.
- It's perspective, Barry.



He's growing a quarter inch a scene.



Remember when the sword was missing
in some scenes?



- Yes, he did know.
- I didn't realise it,



and then I was upset we were putting it
in. I thought, "The joke is over."



- No, you can't do that.
- Yes, you can.



- No.
- No one cares.



Guy gets in a fight in live action,
how long do you keep the Band-Aid?



Some of them, all the way.



- Matthew's really good in that scene.
- Yeah.



- The animation was lovely.
- Let me ask why so much blue.



Because it's a good, complementary
colour with orange and yellow?



- Technology-based.
- I like the colour.



What does that mean?
That's the BS that they throw at you.



- It's a great complement.
- Complementary to orange.



- Sherwin-Williams talk.
- Technology within honey.



- Is that latex-based?
- It's laboratorial.



- Laboratorial?
- Is that a word?



- No.
- What are you, Boris Karloff?



I went into a laboratory,
I wouldn't go, "Where's the blue?"



In terms of colours, when you test,
blue means the future.



The bees have been around a long time.



- You got a mood ring at home?
- The white was too starched.



- Blue's future.
- Simon, who made up those rules?



- No, it's not.
- I thought black was high-tech.



- And silver.
- Any colour you want to be high-tech



- is high-tech.
- The great thing about this



is it's very moving,
but we also got in two greatjokes.



Yeah.



- Renée, I love in this scene.
- Here's where you have the movie.



Yeah, she's really good here.



- That got a big laugh.
- That was a great laugh last night.



This thing with the suicide pact,



and this was Morgan...
What's his last name?



- Kelly.
- Morgan Kelly.



One of my favourite laughs.
It's hard to get a laugh



off of something this small.
When she says, "That kills you twice",



and he does that little thing
on his lip.



The reason you laugh
is the acting is so good.



The way people would say "right".



Does any bee wear
a short-sleeve shirt with buttons?



- All sweaters?
- They wear polo shirts.



- Polo shirts.
- I love that two-shot as well.



- I do too.
- If you think about that,



of where would you put the camera
to get the bee and the girl in the shot,



- it's great.
- This is a scene that we boarded



and it really never changed
in three years.



That line there, "I had to open my mouth
and talk", that's the most sincere



I've ever done anything
in the show business industry.



- I actually had to be sincere.
- Was that hard?



- So hard and uncomfortable.
- It was hard to get it out of you.



- I just hated it.
- So you were never sincere?



Yeah, it works, but it was excruciating.
Like a needle at the doctor.



- That bad to be sincere?
- You said, "You need to be sincere



when you say
'I had to open my mouth and talk."'



Like pulling your pants down
and getting the shot



from the doctor when you're a kid.



- You gotta mean it.
- I gotta mean this?



I've done very well
in 31 years of comedy



without being sincere once.



Then I ran into this problem.



- Well, it worked.
- I had to. I was caught.



Should we talk about the great actors
that are not in the film that recorded?



- Yeah.
- Eric Idle did a wonderful performance.



- Yeah.
- Eric Idle did a wonderful performance.



- He narrated the movie.
- He's a world expert on bees.



World's foremost bee expert,
but he missed the talking.



- That was Eric Idle.
- Played by Eric Idle.



In the end of that movie,
his plan was he wanted to be the first



bee king by transplanting
his head onto Barry's body



with some sort of machine he had
fashioned by watching The Fly



with Jeff Goldblum in 1986
over and over again.



He called it a Goldblum Machine. He
wanted to lure Barry into this chamber



and remove his head
and put the Willingham head



on Barry's head. Then he would
be the first king of the bees.



- And was so good.
- Steve Landesberg.



People are like,
"Why did you take him out? Why?"



Believe me, folks, we didn't want to,
but it's a tricky thing



when you're telling a story...
You can have...



I really fell prey to it...
you know, all the time.



Going off on detours and tangents
that had nothing to do with anything,



butjust things I thought were funny.



And when you play it for an audience,
we'd do test screenings,



the audience would get lost, confused.
They'd lose track of the film.



They end up not liking the movie
because they didn't know



- what the story was about.
- We had to stay with Barry.



The minute you deviated from that,
it never worked.



Once you didn't stay on his
point of view, they lost focus.



- Didn't know what to care about.
- It was frustrating for me



because I'm not interested in the story.
I'd rather just make jokes.



- We found that out.
- Tell them what really happened.



The biggest problem we had
in the story structure of the movie



was the end of the trial,
Barry wins the trial,



always kind of felt like the end
of the movie. It let the air out...



There was no more tension.
Problem solved, movie over.



We didn't want to do that traditional
structure where you end with the trial.



Somebody made the point to me
that it's very unusual



that the big trial scene
is in the middle of the movie.



- It's always at the end.
- Always.



- That's fresh then.
- So one of the ways we had to solve



the problem is the second he wins
the trial, Montgomery comes over



and warns him that this is gonna
have a bad consequence.



Here comes one of my favourite lines.



- "I'm an attorney!"
- I love that line.



We had a few different lines



that Barry would say
when he's on the bald guy's head,



so the guy doesn't attack him.
Trying to explain,



"I'm notjust a bee.
I'm talking, I'm on your side."



So one of them was "I'm an attorney".
One was "I'm a frequent flier member".



- Miles plus.
- The guy said, "Who isn't?"



You know who I bumped into at lunch?
Hans Zimmer's good friend Jim Brooks.



- Really?
- We had a nice chat.



He's a lovely guy. He's the creator
of The Mary Tyler Moore Show



and As Good As It Gets.



- Terms of Endearment.
- Very involved in The Simpsons.



The Simpsons as well.



He was very curious...



...about my experience of the
animation process and, you know...



...how uncomfortable it gets
when you think you can change something



at a certain stage
and then find out you can't.



- You experienced that.
- The two...



He was also a big fan of our TV juniors
that we made for NBC.



- Really? Has he been watching?
- Yeah.



He asked me if he could get a DVD
of all of them together.



- I can get it for him later. Not now.
- Jim Brooks.



No one ever gets anything
for anybody on the spot.



- What about Jim Brooks?
- Barry was asking Hans Zimmer.



- I said I think you mean Jim Brooks.
- Who's a fan of what?



- Jim is a fan of the TV juniors.
- No one's a fan of anything.



I like Hans Zimmer's name.
Sounds like a musical instrument.



Well... it's somewhat appropriate.



- He blew a Hans Zimmer the other day.
- A marzipan cookie



- you'd buy in Europe.
- Also somewhat appropriate.



- Would you like a Hans Zimmer?
- Yeah.



It's very good with coffee at 4.00.



A perfect teatime accompaniment.



- A bit more sincerity.
- This was another sincere moment.



- Alert. Here we go.
- It still wasn't as hard



as "I had to open my mouth and talk".
That was really...



- Yeah, that was a tough one.
- That was really...



- I like this.
- There's the Whee-Lo.



- People loved those...
- Yesterday.



...hexagonal cards.
- Right.



...Hawaiian shirt.
- There it is, Barry.



- Black and yellow hello.
- I got it in there.



- He tried for a year to put get it in.
- We tried to get an ad campaign.



This is another heavy blue...
Why is this so blue?



Very high-tech.



- Why is this all blue?
- Jerry, it's the future.



- They sky is blue.
- Blue is the future.



The auto-pilot is blue.
Her chair is blue. I don't get it.



- Blue is the animator future colour.
- It's a storm. They're in danger.



- It's cool!
- Can you hear this crap, folks?



This is what they say
when you're working on a movie.



You say, "That doesn't look right."
They say,



- "This is an animation thing we do."
- You wanna know they're in danger.



Blue meant technology.
Now it means danger.



- I thought red meant danger.
- Is there anything else?



- Please write it down.
- The BS flies fast and furious



around these parts.
Whatever we need to shut you up,



that's what it is.



- More blue for you.
- Yeah, more blue.



- The whole damn thing is blue.
- We need a Sherwin-Williams.



It's pretty. That's an answer.



I know it looks fake, but it's pretty.



- It's not fake.
- You're not treating me



- like an idiot.
- I love this moment,



the slapping we never thought
was gonna work.



It kills. Travolta gets a big laugh too.



- A big laugh.
- The idea that a human hand



could even hit a bee in the face
so flush that it would make



- a sound like that.
- A leap of faith.



You never could see it
until it was fully executed.



- Right.
- Here's that Bogart type of thing



that Barry gets to do.



Did Barry come with us to Phoenix?
He missed that.



- He missed that fateful day.
- Yeah, Barry.



I think the last credit in the film
belongs to Chris Bianco.



Of Phoenix, Arizona
who was our good friend.



And he's master... He's a pizza master.
He has a pizzeria in Phoenix called



Pizzeria Bianco.
It's the best pizza in the world.



- Including Italy.
- Beyond the best pizza.



- Phenomenal.
- He's a wonderful guy, good friend.



We went there to celebrate
the end of the movie.



It's called a wrap party
in the business.



I guess maybe eight or ten of us went.



We flew to Phoenix
and had pizza there that day.



We gave him a credit at the end
because we love his pizza so much.



Pizza Consultant, Chris Bianco. Barry,
who knows a good meal when he sees it...



What, are you insulting me?



...stayed in town for some meetings
that will change the course of rivers.



- Meetings?
- You were there the first time we went.



- I've never been there.
- The bee looks big here.



It's camera angle.
He's close to the lens, she's far away.



- It's perspective, Barry.
- Perspective.



Should we talk about our cameo?



I defer to you on that one.



- Who's got a cameo?
- There's a head



of another major animation studio
that has a cameo.



- No!
- About here.



Maybe there, maybe not.



- This worked well.
- This was terrific.



This came out much better
than I thought.



- Good.
- Thank you.



I love that shot where it goes
from the monitor to the real thing.



Radar.



- I love when you say "Drop it in".
- Why do you like that?



It's ridiculous.



- That's great.
- I have my little cameo coming up.



Here's Christina, our producer,
on the left, and this BlackBerry.



- That was Ed Bradley before.
- Right.



- Ed Bradley's last appearance.
- Ed Bradley was who?



- Ed Bradley's last appearance.
- Ed Bradley was who?



- The guy in the background.
- Grey-bearded black guy.



- This was great.
- He's still got the stinger on.



I always love that tie that Adam wears.



- You like the tie.
- I tried to find one. I couldn't.



We should talk about the song.



- What song?
- Here Comes the Sun.



Oh, yeah. We were very excited
that The Beatles gave us the rights



to use their song in the movie.



We struggled for a long time
to come up with an ending



that we all felt good about.
Nick was the one who figured out



if we play this song through
the comedy scene in the florist,



you'll feel... You don't wanna feel
like the movie keeps going after this.



You're ready for it to end
at this stage.



- "Key chain" was Andy Robin's line.
- It was?



Yep.



- Then Sheryl Crow came in.
- That's a Spike Feresten joke.



Talk about Sheryl Crow
and what an amazing job she did.



Sheryl Crow sings the song,
a beautiful version.



- She did a greatjob.
- Really good.



- I like the orchestration.
- Hans came in with Rupert,



and they did orchestration.



We even had George Martin in the studio,
the famed Beatles producer, came in,



and listened to us do it.
Was it Abbey Road?



- It was at Air.
- Will that be on the album?



- Which is his studio.
- Should be.



Apparently came from his country home



- just to be there.
- I hope we put that original song



on the album that you and Shaiman wrote.



- That will be on there as well.
- I love that song.



I'm sorry it's not in the movie,
in the middle of the movie.



- We tried.
- It never worked.



We all have regrets, don't we?



I've had a few.



Too few to mention.



- That's catchy.
- Another heavy guy.



Another heavy guy.
It's the same guy.



We've got four characters. We put them
in different moustaches and shirts.



- The pilot is Dan...
- Don't reveal our secret.



It's all smoke and mirrors.



Columbus and 67th.
That's where I met my wife.



- Really?
- Yes, it is.



- Is that why they?
- I think it's a coincidence.



- But a good one.
- A great little detail for the...



What's this kid doing
with Larry King's glasses?



- And mug.
- Got four glasses, all the same.



We had one pair of glasses.



This is a great shot.
Took them a long time to do.



The pollen wisps. Simon,
you were working hard on those.



Now we can begin to talk
about the end of the movie.



And how many different endings we had.



Oh, God. This is gonna hurt a little.



This is ending number 150.



Even the cow thing showed up earlier
as a line, not a whole scene.



- Just as a joke.
- I love the way the bell dingles.



I do too.



- That's a big laugh at the end.
- Who could do better than Chris Rock?



Yeah, he's a great character.
That really came alive



when we got Chris Rock.



By the way,
you know United Airlines new slogan?



- What?
- Time to fly.



Really? That's great.



- Really? From this?
- Yeah.



Yeah, from this, Barry.
They stole it from us.



What happened
to "We're ready when you are"?



I called them up. I'm in the shower.
I'm almost ready.



- That was Delta, wasn't it?
- Delta's ready when you are.



I said, "Give me another 15 minutes."



For those who love stand-up
from the early '80s,



there's another good example of it.



Bravo.
