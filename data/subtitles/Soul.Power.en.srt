When you're bad, you can do
what you wanna do.

39
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,415
First of all, we wanna thank
all the newsmen

40
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,001
for so graciously coming out
at this hour

41
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,671
to see the people's champion
depart for Africa.

42
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,756
The dream is now becoming a reality.

(Ali) The people's choice.

44
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:02,598
So what we're going to do here today
is to talk about...Ali leaving here,

45
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,810
going to meet George Foreman
in his quest to regain his crown

46
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,937
as the heavyweight champion
of the world.

47
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:13,358
"Regain"? Defend my crown.
I'm going to defend my crown.

48
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,861
What I wanna do is add
a little bit more to this,

49
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,322
the complementary proposal
we're gonna have down there

50
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,116
with a festival that will complement
the greatest sporting event

51
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,492
in the history of the world.

52
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,162
Some of the most dynamic performers
from Afro-America

53
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,206
will be appearing down there

54
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,918
for the benefit of all that are honoured
and privileged to be at the stadium

55
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,962
in Kinshasa on 20th, 21st and 22nd,

56
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,548
along with the world
with its theatrical release.

57
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:37,966
It will be James Brown,

58
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,510
who is Soul Brother Number One,
one of our top leading black artists...

59
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:44,181
-(Ali) is he coming?
-Yes, James Brown will be there.

60
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,642
-We will have BB King...
-(Ali) Mmm!

61
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,645
-The Spinners, Miriam Makeba...
-(Ali) Mmm!

66
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,190
(McManus) How the hell did they
slide the double-deck under here?

67
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,317
Or did they start up here?
Does it feel firmer than it was?

68
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,693
Oh, yeah.

69
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,154
Let's hook up the winch leads.

70
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,282
Hook up the winch leads.
I wanna get it 4 feet in the air.

71
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:10,285
Mickey was doing that last night.
I don't know how it works.

72
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:13,121
Check the mains
and the meters. Gary!

73
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,750
lf you want to, there's some service
receptacles on this first pull-switch.

74
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:20,420
You can start checking
readings on this board here.

75
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:24,591
The matrix memory has been out
since end of Cat Stevens,

76
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,803
and I wanna find out, it just came
from there right to here, all right?

77
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,692

(Radio interference)

80
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:09,636
Try 18 right now cos we're getting
a lot of crap from you right now.

81
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,597
(Radio interference)

82
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,975
It's worse. Go back to 17.

83
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,812
'... he's standing right here and
he's just stopped work all together

84
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,731
'and he's not gonna do anything
until he's been paid

85
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,900
'for everything he's done so far.'

86
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,361
So we're caught up
in the middle of all this, right?

87
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:30,449
'Right, the show is gonna suffer,
it's already suffered.'

88
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:34,703
I'll have to get a hold of Bradshaw
and have him call the government

89
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,664
and find out about the payment
of those people out there.

90
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,499
Zaire.

91
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:45,505
I don't have the time for that,
what do you want? Who's this?

92
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:49,551
Hi, Bob, come over
and get your picture took.

93
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:53,180
Foreman's eye got cut.
It's on the AP, man.

94
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:57,976
Foreman got a cut in his eye and
they're talking about postponing the fight.

95
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:01,104
I'm not, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, yeah.

96
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,065
Making it all up. I'm calling every artist
and telling them that.

97
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,568
It's a practical joke
for the day before the thing.

98
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:07,861
(Laughter)

99
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,989
We just gotta go straight ahead.
There's still gonna be a festival, man.

100
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,741
-We can't cancel it.
-No, everything is all go.

101
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,910
Everything is on straight ahead.
I n fact, don't tell anyone.

102
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,161
No.

103
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,247
Okay, I'll call you back
in about a half hour. Okay, later.

104
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:25,253
Hold on. So, we've got the press party,
we've got the plane,

105
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,216
we've got the Holiday Inn,
we've got limousines.

106
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:34,429
You'll get shots in Africa upon arrival.

107
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,348
lf we make it!

108
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,391
(Laughter)

109
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,020
I mean, how do you call performers
and say, "Hey, it's cancelled,

110
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,022
"because Foreman cut his eye"?

111
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:47,692
That's what's so weird about this,
the fight and the music together, man,

112
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,612
you know, like, they just...
no one will ever understand that.

113
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:51,988
The festival must go on.

114
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:55,575
We got people down in Kinshasa,
the stage is being built,

115
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,202
the crew gotta pull out,

116
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,038
Bill McManus and Chip Monck gotta go
on the road with the Rolling Stones.

117
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,749
It's impossible for us to delay,
not one day,

118
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,501
it's impossible for us to delay a minute.

119
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,758
(Bradshaw)'Our main concern
at the moment

120
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,428
'is we've got 36 hours to go
for the festival, less.'

121
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,558
Anything else?

122
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,521
No, I don't see any problems
with the stadium.

123
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,939
We oughta have a little meeting...

124
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,608
And what about the reception
for the artists tonight?

125
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,986
I understand the aircraft
is now about midnight, right?

126
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,989
Somewhere between 10:00
and 11:00 I'm told now.

127
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,741
Have you found out if it's going
via Las Palmas or Madrid?

128
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,827
It's going by Madrid.

129
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,038
I got a call from...

130
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,291
Oh, you said the World Airways man
was here now.

131
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,419
He's out at the airport. He told me
that it'd be between 10:00 and 11:00.

132
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,922
We have to see him. In terms
of trying to get this charter back.

133
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,174
Yeah, I talked to him already.
I've already queried him on that.

134
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,927
I asked him if we could get a charter
out of here on the evening of 24th.

135
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,262
And?

136
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,472
Very good possibility of it.

137
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:12,360
(Woman) Do you want my passport?
(Woman #2) You have it? You've got it?

138
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:16,823
Okay. That's what I want to know?
You need to fill out both of these, okay?

139
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,410
Then you can have this.
Elizabeth. All right, Elizabeth.

140
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,288
(Bustling and chatter)

141
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,084
How do you feel about this?
It's obvious the answer.

142
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,878
But you of all people,

143
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:34,174
the most respected American
in Africa, going to Africa.

144
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,301
I mean, you are respected.

145
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:40,013
Come on, now, you know
where that's at.

146
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,893
I just feel good, man. I just feel
I'm a part of a great movement.

147
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,897
I see the water now, I'm glad to see you.
I'm just glad to be here.

148
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:54,194
Whoo! Who set up this meal, man?
Mama used to cook these.

149
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,321
Yeah, yeah!

150
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,867
James Brown, I work here.
Can I get your autograph, please?

151
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:06,206
-Michelle, I'm getting it!
-That's what we should be doing!

152
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,583
Michelle, come here.
Here she is.

153
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:12,545
-M-i-c-h-e-l-l-e?
-Yes.

154
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,422
I can't even spell all of that now.

155
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,096
(Tannoy)'Anybody that hasn't had
their tickets processed,

156
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,640
'please go to the counter
outside the main ballroom.'

157
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,850
Can't beat it, good food.

158
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,311
Soul cookin' in the bag.

159
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:35,777
My brothers and sisters, on behalf
of the 23 million people of Zaire,

160
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:40,407
I wish to extend their deepest gratitude
and appreciation.

161
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,284
And I wanna thank you
for making a dream come true,

162
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,746
that one day the beat
would return to the roots.

163
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:52,377
The best music you ever gonna hear in
your life is gonna be heard in Kinshasa.

164
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,463
They playin' some grooves down there
just make you cry.

165
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,966
There gonna be dancing
and shouting and jumping.

166
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:03,138
You'll have so much fun, you'll throw
your passports back on the airplane.

167
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,475
again, I wanna thank all of you.

168
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:11,604
And I wanna say bon voyage
on your musical historic mission,

169
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,650
Zaire '74, a spiritual commitment.

170
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:16,943
Thank you.

171
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,071
(Cheers and applause)

172
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,953
(Airplane engine roars overhead)

173
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,460
Oh, Christ, move round again.

174
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,504
(Man) Whaddya want from us?

175
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,300
So, what's the latest on the aircraft,
by the way?

176
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,720
Um, Alan to base.

177
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,182
Alan to base.

178
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,857
Did you get anything
after we met this afternoon?

179
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,985
-On the time it left Madrid?
-Oh, you know what we got?

180
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,155
We got a huge discrepancy
on the day that this festival starts,

181
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:06,701
um, cos Likuku said he had just come
from the presidency himself,

182
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,037
the presidency has notified
every newspaper

183
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,039
and all the TV and radio stations,

184
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:15,251
that it is on Saturday that it starts,
not Friday night.

185
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,961
You're saying no and I said...

186
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:20,548
No, tickets are printed for Friday,
it's always been Friday,

187
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,009
in the contract it's Friday,
the contract was signed six months ago.

188
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,261
But he said the presidency has moved it.

189
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,933
But he told me this morning that
it was going on absolutely as scheduled.

190
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,685
-Who did? Shimpupu?
-Shimpupu.

191
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,815
Who's going to pick up the bloody tab
for the artists? The extra tab?

192
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,151
They are contracted to be here
until the 25th.

193
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:43,321
Yeah, their problem says
they perform on 20, 21, or 22, right?

194
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,572
I understand that...

195
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:48,576
So if we ask them to perform on 23,
they'll say it's outside my contract

196
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,663
and they'll bloody well rip us off
for an extra fee.

197
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,624
We don't know that.
I'd like the extra day for better show.

198
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,044
My experience is the moment
you ask them to do anything

199
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,631
that's one dollar outside of their contract,
they are going to bloody well fight.

200
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,759
Every further day, I've got 200 people,
hotel bills, expenses...

201
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,762
We're still coming in two days
ahead of schedule, though.

202
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,098
-Anyway...
-lf we can make it three, all the better.

203
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,684
(Pariser) We got a weight it all.
I figure it's up to them.

204
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,644
lf we can get them to agree to it,

205
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,438
we've got enough ticket sales,
which is important.

206
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:23,653
(Bradshaw) We'll see. I'm not happy
about late changes like this.

207
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,948
Particularly when the situation
is as confused as it is now.

208
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:34,747
Alan to base.

209
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:41,588
'Let's bring up the one and only
James Brown!'

210
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,343
(Cheering and whistling)

211
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,513
Why you wanna do this to me?

212
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,266
I got to do it to ya
cos you did it to yourself!

213
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,894
You earned it! James Brown!

214
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,355
Oh, man.

215
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,232
Ladies and gentlemen,

216
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:05,612
right now I'd like to give
another special round of applause

217
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,824
by the way of beautiful singers,
the fabulous Spinners.

218
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,035
The Spinners!

219
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:18,875
Bring up Mr BB King.
Mr BB King, come right on up.

220
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,964
Let's give a round of applause
for the one and only Mr Bill Withers.

221
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,175
Come on, a big round!

222
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,763
You say just plain Bill?
He's not just plain Bill! A winner!

223
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,515
Give him another big round of applause.

224
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:39,395
The only thing I got to say is
that it's been a long time comin',

225
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:43,316
and these are just four things
I'd like to leave with you.

226
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,610
Four small things.

227
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,989
It's cold-blooded but it's been hell.

228
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,617
Now here's the payback,

229
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:57,705
and remember as long as you live,
Papa don't take no mess.

230
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:03,336
-No, no.
-This stage doesn't look complete.

231
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,089
There's bunting that goes
across the front and so on.

232
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:10,677
There's a lot of dressing that
makes it look naked without it, but...

233
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,347
-All that's prepared and in-hand?
-There is planking on the backside.

234
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,766
There's several more things
they're gonna do, but...

235
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,978
They guarantee me they'll have it done
by late tomorrow afternoon.

236
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,896
Any other problems?

237
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,358
(♪ Bongo beat)

238
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,936
(Chanting)

239
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,527
(Shouts)

240
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,753
(Buzzing)

241
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,089
Flies are faster here
than they are in the States.

242
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,674
Ain't that something?

243
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,052
They eat too much in America,
they lazy.

244
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,847
They get too much to eat.

245
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:41,851
These flies, they don't get enough to eat,
so they stay hungry and fast.

246
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,436
(Laughter)

247
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,564
I thought the Congo was a lot of jungle

248
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,401
and little rough Mau Maus
running around, attacking, you know?

249
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,529
You hear about all this,
what they in American make you think.

250
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,156
Some people scared to come over here,

251
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,241
it was in the press,
"Scared to come over here."

252
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:00,745
And people drive their cars
and they so peaceful and nice.

253
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,331
And they got their own airports
and hotels

254
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:08,461
and little houses and little streets
and little nightclubs and they ain't so bad.

255
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,963
No kidding, New York is
more of a jungle than here.

256
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,092
The policemen arrive
with .45 guns and dogs.

257
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,095
Every minute a homicide,
somebody dies.

258
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:21,849
Dying with dope and always somebody
being raped or somebody being robbed

259
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:25,061
or somebody on the rooftop
shooting twelve people.

260
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:29,440
A man goes in the bank and shoots
the teller and stabs the bank official

261
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,026
and he runs out
and he gets shot down the street.

262
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,779
Two cars, head-on, doing 100 mph.

263
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,865
Train jumped over a track,
mine caves in.

264
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,617
Always something in America.

265
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,869
It's so peaceful over here.

266
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,205
Really, the savages are in America.

267
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,666
You know, I mean, I'm a world traveller

268
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,086
and I consider myself one
the most travelled black men in America,

269
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,754
I'm getting around the world.

270
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,840
And I'm seeing things that I never saw,

271
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,884
so I know the average man,
the layman wouldn't even thought of it.

272
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:01,639
I'm getting on a DC-10 in Paris
and all Africans flying and operating it.

273
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,766
Here he is, taking the big jet off.

274
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,561
(Imitates engine noise)

275
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,729
And navigating, hitting little buttons.

276
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,566
(Imitates engine noise)

277
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,318
And coming through lightning
and thunder.

278
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,904
(Continues making engine noise)

279
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:21,951
'Pulling that big old jet plane through
the sky and flying it for 15 hours.'

280
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,203
(♪ Woman sings in Spanish)

281
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,546
(♪ Pace quickens)

282
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,553
(♪ Sings in Spanish)

283
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,774
Well, James, it seems like
we're going back home.

284
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,611
Yeah, after such a long time.

285
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:00,281
We finally, um, got our heads together.

286
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,117
We ain't been to Kinshasa.
We don't know what to expect.

287
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:06,412
We're gonna be met by a country
that expected a fight.

288
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,916
Instead they're gonna get the greatest
musical performance there ever was.

289
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:15,421
Every little band in Kinshasa and Zaire
is playing a James Brown beat.

290
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:19,217
Now it's a total, total, total
French-speaking country

291
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,845
and they sing every one
of your lyrics in English.

292
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,972
Now that says a whole lot for me.

293
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:29,060
-It says that we're not coming...
-We're there.

294
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,896
... black is here.

295
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,565
We've been back and forth,
getting reports, man,

296
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,651
about the way that people feel
about this, man.

297
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,362
This is the biggest thing that
ever happened to them, man.

298
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,280
And it's the biggest thing
that ever happened to us.

299
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,909
(♪ Singing in Spanish)

300
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,222
-lf you're going back now...
-I have to get back there, yeah.

301
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,100
How are you fixed? Are you going back
to the hotel? You got transport?

302
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,436
I'm gonna go back with Shimpupu.
He's here. So any problems...

303
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,064
Shimpupu is here? That's the man
I've been waiting to see, where is he?

304
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,441
-Over there. Do you want to see him?
-That's exactly right.

305
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,735
-How are you, Alan, all right?
-Tired.

306
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:23,114
You better wait now Shimpupu is here.
See what we can sort out.

307
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,740
-Keith?
-Yes?

308
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,451
He was fully told about all of that stuff,
time and time again.

309
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,453
Doesn't matter. It's all history.

310
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,456
Go and ask McManus
to join us with Shimpupu,

311
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,667
because I want to get
McManus' problem sorted out.

312
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,878
-What problem is that?
-His bloody cable problem.

313
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,880
Eight thousand bucks worth
of damn cable

314
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,091
which is just gonna go down
for four days and go back up again

315
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,093
which is the government's
responsibility anyhow.

316
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:47,179
And this fella says
he's not gonna put it down...

317
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,641
I wanna lay it to Shimpupu
cos he said he'd sort it.

318
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,310
Bill!

319
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:03,946
Wait, which Shimpupu is this?
This is the journalist?

320
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:07,116
-Yeah.
-Oh, no.

321
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:10,119
-The wrong man's here.
-(Bradshaw) Sorry!

322
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,705
We been on this plane now,
we going on 13 hours.

323
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:17,376
Thirteen hours on an airplane
with all this energy and all this great vibe

324
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,003
and all this good feeling.

325
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,505
I'm almost high off it
just listening to the great music.

326
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,299
Lloyd Price never got high in his life.

327
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:27,303
Never ever. But I tell you,
I promise you the spiritual commitment,

328
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,804
the rhythm and the beat,

329
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:33,225
and we're going to Kinshasa
for Zaire '74, that's what's happening.

330
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,311
(♪ Latino music)

331
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,653
People waiting at the airport

the line-up had too many Zaire artists
following one another

519
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,850
so they wanted to change it,
to mix it up,

520
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:22,103
and if I would accept to do that.

521
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:25,398
I said, well, I don't want to give
anybody any problems.

they want me to fight here.

This fight is for the freedom, justice and
equality of the black man in America

587
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,690
so that I may take my title and my fame

588
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:54,401
and go out and uplift little black people
in the ghettos,

who entertainers won't speak for.

591
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,616
All those entertainers is coming here,

592
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:04,161
don't none of them really get on no
television and give up every quarter

593
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,664
to say something that's against
white people, the government.

594
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,084
All those entertainers, I'm not getting
on 'em, but I have to lead the way.

595
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:14,338
Now God has made me bigger than
all of the entertainers in America,

596
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,966
God has made me bigger
than all the entertainers in the world,

to whup this man, get my title,

599
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,976
so I can use it to help uplift
the black man in America.

600
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,645

with this intention.

what we'll do and the way we'll do it.

(Singing in French)

681
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:14,149
So what we're coming back here
with is what we left here with,

682
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:18,069
plus the influences that
we picked up from living...er...

683
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:22,115
where we've lived for the last
3 or 400 years or whatever, y'know?

684
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:25,785
So we're coming back now
in the same form

685
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:28,329
but with other places on it.

686
01:09:28,455 --> 01:09:30,999
Meanwhile, they've evolved
from the point

687
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:33,126
where we all were when we left here.

688
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:39,048
So we've evolved in one corner,
they've evolved in the other corner.

689
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,343
And now we're gonna come back
and listen to each other

690
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:46,556
and I know I'm gonna go home
knowing something...

691
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:49,392
Somebody asked me,
"What are you gonna bring back?

692
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:52,729
"You gonna bring back any souvenirs?
Somebody wants cloth and all like that."

693
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:55,356
What I wanna bring back
is the feeling.

694
01:09:55,482 --> 01:10:00,570
I think of us as a people
that was maybe left out in the desert.

695
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:05,867
We were taken away and dropped off
in the desert by parachute.

696
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:09,037
We know that we got a home
someplace, but where?

697
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:12,665
So we still got the same feelings,
we still got the same ties,

698
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:15,460
we know that there it is, but where?

699
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:19,214
We know it's inside of us,
we know that it must be someplace

700
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,217
that somebody's thinking
along the same lines of us.

701
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:26,179
So we're in this little colony,
we're being treated a certain way,

702
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:29,641
and parts of it we don't understand,
we're in a different land,

703
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:33,186
we're in places where people speak
a different language we don't know.

704
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:37,899
But we do know, deep down in, through
the years, even though a lot of us died,

705
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:40,568
we still know that those ties
are there somewhere.

706
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:27,448

707
01:11:27,574 --> 01:11:29,742

You hate to admit it
and you don't mean it that way,

712
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:36,142
but your people don't want
the slave to be free.

713
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:40,855
That's the whole thing. They'll say,
"'Really?" Well, why not let me go?

714
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:46,069
Why not let me go, white man?
They don't want to let that Negro go.

715

it would've been pitiful.
