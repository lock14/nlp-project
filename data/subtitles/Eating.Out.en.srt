1
00:00:02,195 --> 00:00:03,127
Coming!

2
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,159
Who is it?

3
00:00:12,172 --> 00:00:12,934
Phone service ma'am.

4
00:00:16,876 --> 00:00:17,808
Phone service ma'am.

5
00:00:20,346 --> 00:00:20,710
Hi.

6
00:00:22,782 --> 00:00:23,180
Howdy ma'am.

7
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:26,042
The phone. it's in my

8
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:27,076
boudoir.

9
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:33,088
it works fine ma'am.

10
00:00:35,695 --> 00:00:36,024
Does it?

11
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,431
You didn't call me for the
phone.

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:44,695
I did.

13
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,438
Where do you think you're
going?

14
00:00:54,047 --> 00:00:55,537
Maybe this isn't such a good
idea.

15
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,617
You called me for a reason.

16
00:00:59,185 --> 00:00:59,617
Okay...

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,480
I thought you were cute.

18
00:01:04,824 --> 00:01:05,654
You like that, huh.

19
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:07,350
Please.

20
00:01:08,261 --> 00:01:08,750
Hold still.

21
00:01:09,762 --> 00:01:10,126
Please...

22
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,699
stop, this isn't funny.

23
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:15,031
it's not funny to call in fake
phone trouble and waste my time.

24
00:01:15,735 --> 00:01:16,269
You're scaring me.

25
00:01:16,269 --> 00:01:16,928
Damn right, bitch.

26
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:17,264
Stop!

27
00:01:20,807 --> 00:01:22,206
I have a stun gun in here!

28
00:01:22,942 --> 00:01:23,431
Go for it.

29
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:22,526
Did you come?

30
00:02:23,636 --> 00:02:24,330
No...

31
00:02:25,038 --> 00:02:25,970
did you?

32
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:28,570
No, I was faking it for you.

33
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,036
I was faking it for you!

34
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:36,171
Jesus Christ, I thought you
were-

35
00:02:36,249 --> 00:02:37,216
I thought You were coming.

36
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:40,277
I'm sorry Tiffani, i-

37
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:43,214
I can't get into it with you
Caleb, You didn't even

38
00:02:43,756 --> 00:02:44,814
grab my titties.

39
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:47,451
it didn't occur to me.

40
00:02:50,063 --> 00:02:52,531
My titties didn't occur to
you?

41
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,930
Look at them Caleb.

42
00:02:55,768 --> 00:02:57,065
They occur to every man i
meet.

43
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:57,693
But not you!

44
00:02:58,905 --> 00:02:59,872
I don't think this is working.

45
00:03:00,373 --> 00:03:01,362
I can be meaner.

46
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:05,111
I need a little shake en' bake
in my iife.

47
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:06,135
I need to feel...

48
00:03:06,212 --> 00:03:06,541
dirty.

49
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:08,079
Filthy.

50
00:03:08,748 --> 00:03:09,737
You're so...

51
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,008
S.u.V.

52
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:12,978
Double coupons.

53
00:03:13,052 --> 00:03:14,349
Family fun.

54
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,648
I'll break stuff next time.

55
00:03:15,722 --> 00:03:16,313
Caleb, it's over.

56
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:17,619
Tiffani...

57
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:17,951
Good-bye.

58
00:03:18,258 --> 00:03:20,021
I waited twenty-four days to
have sex with you.

59
00:03:20,193 --> 00:03:20,488
Well

60
00:03:21,261 --> 00:03:22,489
I didn't want to seem like a
slut.

61
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,264
Tiffani...

62
00:03:24,264 --> 00:03:25,128
Caleb?

63
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:27,361
Leave. I gotta jetta.

64
00:03:31,304 --> 00:03:31,827
My belt?

65
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:40,312
Fucking bitch!

66
00:03:43,716 --> 00:03:45,308
I'm still not buying it.

67
00:03:48,454 --> 00:03:49,648
Give me another chance.

68
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,322
I am not...

69
00:03:52,558 --> 00:03:53,582
a slot machine.

70
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:56,187
Goodbye Caleb.

71
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:57,252
You're a...

72
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,558
decent boy.

73
00:04:03,102 --> 00:04:03,864
Nice ass.

74
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:26,814
Heterosexuals are a fucked
up species.

75
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:28,112
Twenty-four days!

76
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:29,515
And then one week of not
raping her mean enough

77
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:31,113
and then I get shut out!

78
00:05:31,758 --> 00:05:32,986
Almost like a computer man.

79
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:34,026
You do every little thing right.

80
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:34,952
and then wham

81
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:36,560
sad face fatal error

82
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:37,323
3801!

83
00:05:37,497 --> 00:05:38,865
For us, sex on the first date
is a given.

84
00:05:38,865 --> 00:05:40,457
You figure out hardware
mismatches

85
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:41,500
and move on.

86
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:43,261
Oh, well it's just so easy bake

87
00:05:43,336 --> 00:05:43,995
for you.

88
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,002
Most guys don't know when
to

89
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:45,969
stop moving on.

90
00:05:46,372 --> 00:05:47,430
At least you get laid all the
time.

91
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:50,635
Hey, it's like 104 days
between dates for me,

92
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,007
because I don't look like you.

93
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:53,202
Like me?

94
00:05:54,514 --> 00:05:55,572
I am not gonna stroke your
gorgeous,

95
00:05:55,648 --> 00:05:57,172
muscular ego.

96
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:01,248
So what happened to that
Jason thing?

97
00:06:01,454 --> 00:06:01,920
Justin.

98
00:06:03,055 --> 00:06:04,957
Guys around here are like
day-old donuts,

99
00:06:04,957 --> 00:06:06,447
I mean I eat them because
they're there,

100
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:08,349
but you don't want to invest
anything in them.

101
00:06:09,162 --> 00:06:10,891
At least you got a whole box
right there.

102
00:06:10,963 --> 00:06:11,691
You don't have to starve.

103
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:13,423
Caleb, I'm on Friendster,

104
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:16,195
my life is so Not-Having-Sex
and the City right now.

105
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:20,562
if oniy I were gay.

106
00:06:21,941 --> 00:06:22,407
Honey,

107
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,103
come out or stay in,

108
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:25,974
do not Heche me into a
Mariah.

109
00:06:26,212 --> 00:06:27,213
I don't mean literally.

110
00:06:27,213 --> 00:06:28,407
Oh of course, liliterally.

111
00:06:28,781 --> 00:06:29,682
You know what I mean.

112
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:30,239
You know

113
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,981
it's easier for us to get
chicks too.

114
00:06:33,586 --> 00:06:35,349
Straight girls love gay boys.

115
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:37,116
I could have any girl I wanted.

116
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,282
Shut the fuck.

117
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,255
Serial killer.

118
00:06:39,892 --> 00:06:41,018
Remember Marcy Brooks?

119
00:06:44,063 --> 00:06:45,826
Shut the fuck! Milkshake
Marcy?

120
00:06:45,898 --> 00:06:46,956
Senior year, right after i
came out,

121
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:47,624
senior year

122
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:49,258
she offered to Hoover me.

123
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:50,558
To see if she could she could
cure me.

124
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:52,263
But you were a geekazold.

125
00:06:52,338 --> 00:06:52,997
No offense.

126
00:06:56,676 --> 00:06:57,643
Because I'm gay.

127
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:03,181
Now I really want to be a fag.

128
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:04,375
You and Ricky Martin both.

129
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:05,909
Jennifer Seaver.

130
00:07:06,352 --> 00:07:07,546
Jenny the Beaver!? Fire-
crotch?

131
00:07:10,356 --> 00:07:12,347
Shoves her fist in my pants.

132
00:07:12,425 --> 00:07:14,757
Full-on grabs my corndog.

133
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:16,658
Swearto God I was gonna
puked.

134
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,296
They feel safe with us
because we're not a threat.

135
00:07:19,665 --> 00:07:21,292
Like how they get naked in
front of puppies.

136
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:22,957
We're just puppies with dicks.

137
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:24,795
You know, some girls with
their puppies-

138
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:26,201
let them eat them right out.

139
00:07:26,772 --> 00:07:27,761
Read that in the Kinsey
report.

140
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:29,204
My spec-i-a-lity.

141
00:07:29,275 --> 00:07:31,010
What I woulda done with the
Beav.

142
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:31,840
impregnated her.

143
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:33,269
Got a shit job.

144
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:34,981
Sounds real hot.

145
00:07:34,981 --> 00:07:36,380
She's not even your type.

146
00:07:39,852 --> 00:07:40,580
So

147
00:07:42,555 --> 00:07:44,955
you think more girls would go
for me if they thought I was gay.

148
00:07:45,391 --> 00:07:46,517
Stop thinking.

149
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,958
You just look pretty and turn
the letters.

150
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:50,254
No! But I mean-

151
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:52,229
Let's get a Sofia Coppoia
things straight here.

152
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:54,330
Being gay is more

153
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,994
than listening to good music
and eating low fat foods.

154
00:07:57,069 --> 00:07:59,503
There are certain things you
have to do to convince the general public.

155
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,072
Oh. Maybe we could stage a
bashing?

156
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:03,843
No,

157
00:08:03,843 --> 00:08:05,011
What you need to do is

158
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:07,411
find the loudest queen on
campus

159
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,277
and smoke his pole.

160
00:08:09,515 --> 00:08:11,813
That would be a wrist stamp
to pussy smorgasbord.

161
00:08:20,693 --> 00:08:21,318
I'm hungry.

162
00:08:22,762 --> 00:08:23,922
I'm not your bitch.

163
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,091
Oh my God!

164
00:08:27,366 --> 00:08:29,061
You pricked it Gwen! You
pricked it!

165
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:30,295
I can't believe it!

166
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:31,358
Oh Gwen, I love you!

167
00:08:31,571 --> 00:08:33,129
I love you too, Joey.

168
00:08:38,945 --> 00:08:39,843
Which one do you want?

169
00:08:41,213 --> 00:08:42,737
Oh honey, that one!

170
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,576
Oh, it's so big!

171
00:08:47,853 --> 00:08:49,184
I love you Bunnycakes!

172
00:08:49,622 --> 00:08:51,249
And I love YOu Gingerbutt.

173
00:08:58,097 --> 00:08:58,825
Mongoloid.

174
00:08:59,565 --> 00:09:00,266
Dildo.

175
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:01,028
Ooh,

176
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:03,269
where'd you learn that ''big
girl'' word?

177
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:04,065
Your girlfriend.

178
00:09:04,136 --> 00:09:04,693
Oops,

179
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:05,236
I mean

180
00:09:05,705 --> 00:09:07,070
ex-girlfriend.

181
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,008
it's my brother, he just got
dumped.

182
00:09:10,076 --> 00:09:10,838
Hard.

183
00:09:12,578 --> 00:09:14,046
Who told you, you little bah-
witch?

184
00:09:14,046 --> 00:09:14,774
I know.

185
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:16,280
He totally is.

186
00:09:21,754 --> 00:09:23,589
uh, excuse me why don't
you?

187
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:26,149
Oh okay, why don't I just turn
into gaseous form for a minute.

188
00:09:27,393 --> 00:09:29,293
Smells like you're halfway
there.

189
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,655
Dogs have a heightened sense
of smell.

190
00:09:32,298 --> 00:09:33,822
With with an ass that big, it's
like

191
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:34,997
spotlights to us.

192
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:36,665
Those are headlights

193
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:38,602
and I don't plan on braking.

194
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:40,973
Keep on pedaling, you're
almost to a busy intersection.

195
00:09:40,973 --> 00:09:43,669
The intersection's only busy
because you're giving half-price blowjobs.

196
00:09:44,276 --> 00:09:45,504
What are the rules to this
game?

197
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,110
I don't know but you just lost,

198
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,171
loser.

199
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:49,243
Freak.

200
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,047
I'm on the phone.

201
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:54,047
He won't leave me alone.

202
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,488
Go graze outside.

203
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:56,216
Stop mooching.

204
00:09:56,288 --> 00:09:58,586
Go back to college and eat
your instant Ramen.

205
00:09:59,425 --> 00:10:00,187
Mom!

206
00:10:00,826 --> 00:10:02,691
Caleb's drinking out of the
milk carton!

207
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:03,953
Am not!

208
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,660
it's the acidophilus!

209
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:10,927
Caleb, Honey? You okay?

210
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,837
We heard you got dumped.

211
00:10:19,979 --> 00:10:21,241
You're way hot!

212
00:10:22,815 --> 00:10:24,180
You're accent sexy.

213
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:32,084
Even homeless people have
accents, Huh?

214
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:47,161
I don't like to kiss.

215
00:10:48,908 --> 00:10:49,533
You're kidding.

216
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,335
Seriously.

217
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,070
You can play with my nipples
if you want.

218
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:02,716
Y'know,

219
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,688
kissing is so 1990s.

220
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:23,904
I think I might be-

221
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,737
Well, I think I might be gay.

222
00:11:29,381 --> 00:11:29,972
Gay?!

223
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:31,113
Well, a little bit.

224
00:11:32,384 --> 00:11:33,942
I turned another one?

225
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:35,179
it could be a phase.

226
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:36,483
Please.

227
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,886
Can you list any tracks on
Madonna's Like a Prayer album?

228
00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:41,320
um, Express Yourself,

229
00:11:41,393 --> 00:11:42,223
Cherish,

230
00:11:42,294 --> 00:11:42,988
Oh Father-

231
00:11:43,095 --> 00:11:43,424
Vogue...

232
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,091
No honey, Vogue was on Dick
Tracy.

233
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,291
it's not a fucking phase,

234
00:11:47,633 --> 00:11:49,225
you're full-fledged homo.

235
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:50,425
Jesus, what'd I do?!

236
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,065
Well,

237
00:11:52,071 --> 00:11:53,663
didn't you ever suspect
that- I mean

238
00:11:54,707 --> 00:11:55,503
I am a little...

239
00:11:57,476 --> 00:11:57,840
I know what you mean.

240
00:12:00,146 --> 00:12:00,669
We're all just

241
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:01,812
people.

242
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:04,549
Just

243
00:12:05,284 --> 00:12:06,273
bodies with

244
00:12:06,485 --> 00:12:07,918
organic needs.

245
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:10,321
We need satisfaction.

246
00:12:11,824 --> 00:12:13,382
We shouldn't deny our bodies.

247
00:12:15,361 --> 00:12:16,385
Let's not deny our bodies.

248
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:18,420
Honey, it's not going to work
this time,

249
00:12:19,498 --> 00:12:20,226
I'm pretty gay.

250
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:23,769
Oh, I was good enough for you
last night you fucking faggot.

251
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:25,771
You're not being very positive
about this.

252
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:27,602
I couldn't be any more
positive if

253
00:12:27,673 --> 00:12:30,005
I was gang raped in a
repository bin

254
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:31,838
at the needle exchange!

255
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:34,943
All I do is help gays come out.

256
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:38,012
So who are you fucking?

257
00:12:39,585 --> 00:12:39,983
Well, i

258
00:12:40,352 --> 00:12:41,410
haven't had sex yet.

259
00:12:41,654 --> 00:12:42,120
Hah!

260
00:12:42,188 --> 00:12:43,280
I mean, except with you.

261
00:12:44,023 --> 00:12:45,320
And some other girl.

262
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:46,516
Get out!

263
00:12:47,193 --> 00:12:48,888
Well, can't we be like, best
friends or something?

264
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:51,088
I already have a gay best
friend.

265
00:12:52,131 --> 00:12:52,529
Yeah,

266
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:53,594
Marc.

267
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:55,392
is he single?

268
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:56,859
Get out!

269
00:13:04,677 --> 00:13:06,110
it's like I'm on a conveyor
belt.

270
00:13:06,178 --> 00:13:08,078
A little piece of sushI no one
wants.

271
00:13:08,547 --> 00:13:09,980
You lookin' for Mr. Right Now?

272
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:12,108
Please, I'll settle for Mr. Five
Minutes Ago.

273
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,714
Sorry.

274
00:13:16,055 --> 00:13:16,783
No prob-

275
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:19,052
-lem.

276
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:20,520
Joey

277
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:22,189
just remember!

278
00:13:22,795 --> 00:13:24,319
Every time you suck a dick!

279
00:13:24,997 --> 00:13:26,259
Every time you poke some
boy

280
00:13:26,332 --> 00:13:28,061
in the brown eye!

281
00:13:28,534 --> 00:13:29,501
Just remember that you've...

282
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,393
eaten...

283
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:31,936
PuSSY!

284
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:34,129
You ate pussy

285
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:35,696
and you liked it!

286
00:13:36,008 --> 00:13:36,406
i, i...

287
00:13:36,475 --> 00:13:37,442
You came!

288
00:13:38,143 --> 00:13:38,871
HI Gwen.

289
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:39,569
Who's your friend?

290
00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:43,375
Oh, Jesus.

291
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:47,483
Fair thee well

292
00:13:47,553 --> 00:13:48,485
my fairy

293
00:13:48,554 --> 00:13:48,986
fay.

294
00:13:49,622 --> 00:13:50,714
Who was that?

295
00:13:51,023 --> 00:13:52,251
I don't know, he's a newborn.

296
00:13:52,825 --> 00:13:53,814
No, the girl.

297
00:13:57,329 --> 00:13:57,658
Gwen.

298
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,456
She's hot.

299
00:13:59,832 --> 00:14:00,491
Yeah, she's cute.

300
00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:03,261
But a total Meredith Brooks
hit single.

301
00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:04,597
Excuse me.

302
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,099
That her boyfriend?

303
00:14:10,376 --> 00:14:12,139
No, her roommate, Marc,

304
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,644
the love of my life.

305
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,742
He's gay

306
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:16,940
and I'm invisible.

307
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:18,677
All her friends gay orwhat?

308
00:14:19,285 --> 00:14:20,217
She's kind of a fag hag.

309
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:21,386
I hate that term.

310
00:14:21,453 --> 00:14:22,442
'Cause you're one.

311
00:14:22,521 --> 00:14:23,385
Shut up. I am not.

312
00:14:23,455 --> 00:14:24,717
You live with me.

313
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:26,882
So she's straight though,
right?

314
00:14:27,126 --> 00:14:28,684
Yeah, but she's totally in love
with Marc.

315
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:31,127
They screwed when he was in
the closet

316
00:14:31,196 --> 00:14:33,096
and she's been trying to
replace him ever since.

317
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:34,757
Doing a real good job,

318
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:35,891
she keeps dating fags.

319
00:14:38,304 --> 00:14:39,498
I feel like a turnstile

320
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:40,538
to the white party.

321
00:14:41,707 --> 00:14:42,935
Why do you keep doing this?

322
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:44,638
I don't know.

323
00:14:47,046 --> 00:14:48,377
They're time bombs, Gwen.

324
00:14:49,581 --> 00:14:51,412
it doesn't seem worth it.

325
00:14:52,284 --> 00:14:53,148
I met you.

326
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:55,710
Let's not go there.

327
00:14:56,922 --> 00:14:58,253
You're the best thing that
ever happened to me.

328
00:15:01,427 --> 00:15:03,895
I wanna go home. Marc, take
me home.

329
00:15:04,096 --> 00:15:06,929
I just got here. Let's hang for
a bit.

330
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,361
I'll do a little damage control.

331
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,669
I bet I looked pretty stupid
out there.

332
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:18,635
Not at all.

333
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:19,643
Liar.

334
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:22,747
You did look sorta goofy.

335
00:15:23,148 --> 00:15:23,807
I did?

336
00:15:27,486 --> 00:15:29,977
You ate pussy! You liked it!

337
00:15:30,322 --> 00:15:31,289
Fuck you!

338
00:15:34,693 --> 00:15:36,718
I almost made it with ''British
Guy'' in a broom closet.

339
00:15:38,464 --> 00:15:39,795
But he wouldn't kiss.

340
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:42,561
Maybe your breath was
penisy.

341
00:15:59,218 --> 00:16:00,708
Can I make you a drink?

342
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,452
Did you want me to make you
a drink?

343
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:09,390
I'm gorgeous, not helpless.

344
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:14,124
it's not a sexist thing. I just
thought you might be... You, know stressed out.

345
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,423
Just get the fuck out of my
way.

346
00:16:17,503 --> 00:16:18,060
Sorry.

347
00:16:19,571 --> 00:16:21,004
Thanks hon, wanna mix one
for yourself?

348
00:16:21,073 --> 00:16:21,835
Fuck you.

349
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:25,368
She just brushed me off-
with a flame-thrower.

350
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:27,071
She's just like that at first.
You like them butch.

351
00:16:32,684 --> 00:16:35,244
Would you stop being a total
zit and leave me alone.

352
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,116
What's taking so long?

353
00:16:37,523 --> 00:16:38,251
Oh, hI Gwen.

354
00:16:39,324 --> 00:16:40,052
You know this guy?

355
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,453
Yeah, this is Caleb. Caleb,
Gwen.

356
00:16:43,328 --> 00:16:45,694
Sorry Caleb. it's been a night.

357
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:47,795
Nice to meet you.

358
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:49,598
Caleb's gay.

359
00:16:55,507 --> 00:16:56,599
You're gay.

360
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:58,933
uh.

361
00:16:59,344 --> 00:17:00,140
Yeah. He's kinda new.

362
00:17:00,846 --> 00:17:04,612
Oh honey. That's so sweet.
You two together?

363
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:05,744
Oh no.

364
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:07,809
Not anymore. We're just
roommates.

365
00:17:08,587 --> 00:17:08,951
Good.

366
00:17:09,721 --> 00:17:11,086
We were never together.

367
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:12,351
Sorry.

368
00:17:13,025 --> 00:17:14,617
Sometimes I can be a cunt
and a half.

369
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,094
I thought you were a drunk
breeder boy

370
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:19,153
going forthe chick in despair.

371
00:17:20,065 --> 00:17:21,965
Your shoes had me fooled.

372
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:26,395
Like I said, he's new.

373
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:30,807
Gwen.

374
00:17:32,811 --> 00:17:33,106
HI Marc.

375
00:17:34,146 --> 00:17:34,407
Kevin.

376
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:35,675
Kyle.

377
00:17:36,148 --> 00:17:38,878
Marc, this is Caleb.

378
00:17:40,652 --> 00:17:40,879
Hi.

379
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:43,219
He's family.

380
00:17:49,428 --> 00:17:51,089
Nice to meet you, Caleb.

381
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:59,367
I'm sorry, I'm totally drunk.

382
00:18:00,105 --> 00:18:01,970
No you're not. You're
designated driver.

383
00:18:02,274 --> 00:18:03,798
No, I think you're wrong,
Gwen.

384
00:18:03,976 --> 00:18:05,705
I was just meeting Gwen
and...

385
00:18:05,777 --> 00:18:06,368
You new here?

386
00:18:06,979 --> 00:18:08,844
He's my roommate. We
dated.

387
00:18:09,748 --> 00:18:11,079
We didn't date.

388
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,516
Let's away, ourwork's done
here.

389
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:15,579
Where are you going?

390
00:18:15,654 --> 00:18:16,552
What?

391
00:18:16,622 --> 00:18:18,690
Let's give them some room
to breathe on each other.

392
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,157
I wanted to talk to Marc.

393
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:22,588
Not a chance with that
around, hon.

394
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,262
So...

395
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:29,900
You stole my boyfriend!

396
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:31,558
He's not your boyfriend.

397
00:18:31,637 --> 00:18:32,729
Oh, so now you're gay?

398
00:18:32,804 --> 00:18:33,862
it was your idea.

399
00:18:33,939 --> 00:18:35,406
You knew how I felt about
him!

400
00:18:35,474 --> 00:18:36,463
We're not doing anything.

401
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:37,531
You're going on a date!

402
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:38,576
That was his idea.

403
00:18:38,644 --> 00:18:41,636
I've been stalking him for
years. You decide to be gay for one night-

404
00:18:41,713 --> 00:18:44,147
I'm not gay! Why don't you
just tell him you like him?

405
00:18:44,483 --> 00:18:46,849
That would be as futile as
drug testing at the Gay Games.

406
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,580
So you think you're gonna get
Gwen like this?

407
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:56,418
I don't know. I don't want to
go.

408
00:18:57,596 --> 00:19:00,622
But he lives with her. I'll get
to see her again.

409
00:19:01,466 --> 00:19:03,832
I can just tell her and get this
all sorted out.

410
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:07,670
Of course there goes any
chance I had with her.

411
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,977
And you live with me, so Marc
will have to come here. This could be parfait.

412
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:18,113
Go on a few dates with Marc,
the four of us hang.

413
00:19:18,183 --> 00:19:21,084
You come to the sad
realization that you're straight.

414
00:19:21,153 --> 00:19:24,088
You go running to Gwen, Marc
comes running to me.

415
00:19:24,156 --> 00:19:28,149
Genius. I'll be your... goatee.

416
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:31,690
How do you know they'll do
that? Sounds ''etch-a-sketchy.''

417
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,227
No, it's parfait.

418
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:36,165
You don't understand human
nature the way I do. I'm a musician.

419
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:37,725
Who got you that date with
Tiffany?

420
00:19:38,237 --> 00:19:39,761
You hit herwith my car on
purpose?

421
00:19:39,838 --> 00:19:43,433
No that was just dumb luck, i
knew how to take advantage of the situation.

422
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:48,040
Plus Tiffany lives right next
door to them and seeing you date her neighbor would kill her.

423
00:19:50,215 --> 00:19:55,254
Okay, one date, and we'll see
how it goes from there- but no sex stuff.

424
00:19:55,254 --> 00:19:56,551
Yeah, try to control yourself.

425
00:20:10,902 --> 00:20:15,134
Fuck me or fuck you?

426
00:20:15,741 --> 00:20:17,732
You'll actually wear it for
what, twenty minutes?

427
00:20:19,044 --> 00:20:20,136
Not with this guy.

428
00:20:20,646 --> 00:20:25,982
Because he's Mr. Wonderful,
Mr. Yin up my Yang,

429
00:20:26,051 --> 00:20:31,284
I talked to him for fifteen
minutes and I feel like I've known him my whole life.

430
00:20:32,591 --> 00:20:34,252
I'll be happy if he likes to
kiss.

431
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:36,320
He's probably a freak.

432
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:39,691
When he's around, my heart
beats like a trailer park house.

433
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:46,099
That is so gay. And I mean all
three definitions.

434
00:20:47,306 --> 00:20:48,568
So what are you doing? Eating
out?

435
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:54,402
Richard's having a b-b-q for
staff in the music department.

436
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,569
And then...?

437
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,614
I dunno,

438
00:21:03,422 --> 00:21:05,151
but try not be here, okay?

439
00:21:06,325 --> 00:21:07,724
Oh, and then you're eating
out.

440
00:21:12,964 --> 00:21:14,556
What if he tries to grab me?

441
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,563
We're not pirates, we just
dress like them... and chase booty.

442
00:21:18,637 --> 00:21:23,074
He'll be just as nervous as
you. So try not to punch him if he makes a move on you or anything.

443
00:21:24,476 --> 00:21:28,572
I don't think I'd punch him. i
think I'd probably just start crying or something.

444
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:31,246
Aww. You got fagitude.

445
00:21:31,683 --> 00:21:36,120
Well, how do I know if he
wants to do it, is there like a code word or something?

446
00:21:36,188 --> 00:21:40,090
You mean like homolingo? We
talk normally... in English.

447
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:42,119
I'm a failed role-model.

448
00:21:44,896 --> 00:21:45,692
Do I look gay?

449
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,295
Like an insatiable bottom.

450
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,238
Why did you say that?

451
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,344
Just to fuck with you. it's for
you, Blowmeo.

452
00:22:02,214 --> 00:22:02,543
Hello?

453
00:22:04,015 --> 00:22:04,379
it's me.

454
00:22:05,384 --> 00:22:09,616
HI Tiffani! I was just running
out the door, but- HI Tiffani!

455
00:22:09,688 --> 00:22:11,747
So, I ran into Max today.

456
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:14,784
How is Max?

457
00:22:15,527 --> 00:22:17,256
Well, he's fine and you're gay.

458
00:22:19,598 --> 00:22:20,929
Oh, that's just-

459
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:22,967
it explains an awful lot.

460
00:22:23,268 --> 00:22:28,069
I thought maybe I wasn't
attractive enough. But now I see where I stand.

461
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:37,179
I thought maybe, you know, i
could win you back to ourteam.

462
00:22:41,787 --> 00:22:43,687
Sorry Tiffani, I'm gay now.

463
00:22:45,891 --> 00:22:46,880
How could you do this to me?

464
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:50,621
Well actually, I think you did it
to me.

465
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,358
I think you turned me gay.

466
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:56,194
I did not turn you gay! How
can you say that?!

467
00:22:56,802 --> 00:22:57,996
I mean don't take it
personally.

468
00:22:58,403 --> 00:23:00,598
I am a person! How else am i
supposed to take it?

469
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,733
Bastard! uhhhhhh.

470
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:05,800
Fag! Fag! Fag! Fag!

471
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:30,600
it's funny, I used to have-
had a friend in this same building.

472
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:32,227
I'll be like five minutes, okay?

473
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:34,835
Please, Siegfried and Roy
couldn't tame your hair.

474
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:35,968
uh, it's OK.

475
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,531
Gwen can keep you company.

476
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:40,106
I'm used to entertaining your
tricks.

477
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:41,977
Okay, mute!

478
00:23:42,514 --> 00:23:46,541
She's kidding. I haven't had a
trick in like so long. I mean-

479
00:23:47,586 --> 00:23:48,917
Tricks are for kids.

480
00:23:50,956 --> 00:23:52,184
I mean, I've had dates, it's
just-

481
00:23:52,257 --> 00:23:54,953
Go powder your nose, babe.
The powder that goes on your nose.

482
00:24:02,801 --> 00:24:06,134
Hello, and welcome to the
Gwen Anderson show.

483
00:24:07,138 --> 00:24:08,230
Mind if I couch with you?

484
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:09,369
Sure.

485
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:11,607
So, what's your majorette?

486
00:24:12,978 --> 00:24:13,876
Poli-sci.

487
00:24:14,646 --> 00:24:15,908
Oo! Brainy smurf.

488
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:18,143
I'm not very good at it
though.

489
00:24:19,651 --> 00:24:21,949
Honest. I like you.

490
00:24:22,821 --> 00:24:23,219
Thanks.

491
00:24:25,624 --> 00:24:26,591
Did you bring condoms?

492
00:24:28,193 --> 00:24:29,660
um.

493
00:24:29,728 --> 00:24:32,322
I'm kidding. Relax. You look so
tense.

494
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:35,899
How's that?

495
00:24:39,037 --> 00:24:39,560
it's nice.

496
00:24:42,574 --> 00:24:45,702
When you guys get home
try not to make too much noise.

497
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:47,540
I have to tutor in the
morning.

498
00:24:49,147 --> 00:24:50,705
I don't think you need to
worry about-

499
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:54,718
Kidding again. I don't tutor.
Make all the noise you want.

500
00:24:55,987 --> 00:25:00,185
This girl upstairs has all
makes them pretend to rape her.

501
00:25:00,992 --> 00:25:04,428
She screams and throws
things. it really freaked me out.

502
00:25:05,163 --> 00:25:06,790
I called the cops the first
couple of times.

503
00:25:07,098 --> 00:25:10,795
Oh. Huh. it probably isn't
different guys.

504
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:14,066
it's probably just the same
just different roles.

505
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:16,404
Oh no, it's different guys.

506
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:20,570
Sometimes there's like three
and they do this whole gang bang routine.

507
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:24,881
She's all ''No! You're doing me
all at once!''

508
00:25:25,784 --> 00:25:29,481
Sick, huh? But you know, to
each her own.

509
00:25:30,956 --> 00:25:34,016
My parents think I'm nuts for
chasing gay boys.

510
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:40,396
Maybe they'd lighten up if i
into orgyastic splendor.

511
00:25:41,433 --> 00:25:49,363
You know, two guys, one
orifice. They call it double dicking.

512
00:25:52,377 --> 00:25:53,469
That's pretty weird.

513
00:25:56,948 --> 00:26:00,645
So...Caleb.

514
00:26:04,823 --> 00:26:08,589
Before you started to go girl,

515
00:26:09,995 --> 00:26:13,726
did you ever go girl?

516
00:26:14,466 --> 00:26:17,435
Oh, no. I mean, just the
thought of it is-

517
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:22,465
Ooh! Defensive. Like not even
before you came out?

518
00:26:23,742 --> 00:26:24,037
No.

519
00:26:26,678 --> 00:26:30,375
Okay, so sue me, but I have
to say it.

520
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:38,153
if you've nevertricked with a
are you sure you pick dick?

521
00:26:39,591 --> 00:26:45,188
Well, um. I've never done it
uh, you know, gay.

522
00:26:47,632 --> 00:26:57,667
My god you're a virgin?
A virgin homosexual? Lemme touch you!

523
00:27:00,478 --> 00:27:01,274
What about Kyle?

524
00:27:02,647 --> 00:27:03,807
Oh, we never...

525
00:27:03,882 --> 00:27:07,079
Thank god, you just don't look
right together.

526
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,946
A virgin.

527
00:27:13,525 --> 00:27:14,856
You're so cute.

528
00:27:17,128 --> 00:27:18,823
How did you make it past 18.

529
00:27:19,698 --> 00:27:24,101
I would have thought some
plucked you from the chicken coop a long time ago.

530
00:27:26,471 --> 00:27:34,037
Well Marc is very gentle. He
You've got nothing to worry about.

531
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,347
Okay.

532
00:27:36,347 --> 00:27:42,377
Caleb, honey.

533
00:27:44,589 --> 00:27:51,722
if you've never had a boy or a
maybe you should try the normal thing first.

534
00:27:53,031 --> 00:28:01,871
I mean why stray down a path
isolation when happiness might be right here.

535
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:12,716
Ever even been curious about
kissing a girl. A little maybe?

536
00:28:15,453 --> 00:28:16,977
um, Gwen?

537
00:28:18,056 --> 00:28:18,613
Yes?

538
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:21,390
We need to talk.

539
00:28:22,694 --> 00:28:24,525
Talk to me.

540
00:28:26,364 --> 00:28:27,353
Am I interrupting?

541
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:31,757
Okay, I tried everything. Total
fag. He's all yours.

542
00:28:33,071 --> 00:28:37,804
She tries that on everyone-
not that there's a lot of guys...

543
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:40,311
You ready?

544
00:28:42,714 --> 00:28:43,681
Sure, whatever.

545
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:49,217
Play with the safety on, boys.

546
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:50,813
Always do, Mother.

547
00:28:53,825 --> 00:28:58,091
Would you boys do me a
favor? it would so turn me on.

548
00:29:00,131 --> 00:29:00,620
What's that?

549
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:05,967
Kiss. I think two guys kissing
is so hot.

550
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:07,497
Not in front of you.

551
00:29:08,606 --> 00:29:09,368
Oh, please?!

552
00:29:09,908 --> 00:29:14,936
We haven't even done it in
I mean we don't even know if we're going there!

553
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:22,645
Think of it as an icebreaker.
Caleb? Please? For me?

554
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:26,823
um, only if it's okay with
Marc.

555
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:27,585
Oh, it's okay.

556
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:28,782
Well great!

557
00:29:30,428 --> 00:29:30,757
Great.

558
00:29:32,263 --> 00:29:32,695
Great.

559
00:29:40,138 --> 00:29:44,234
Please, how's a girl supposed
I kissed my grandma like that in her coffin.

560
00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:45,742
Gwen, if he doesn't want-

561
00:29:58,056 --> 00:30:01,355
Wow. That's a way to start a
date.

562
00:30:03,995 --> 00:30:04,461
How was that?

563
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:06,787
it was great.

564
00:30:07,165 --> 00:30:07,995
it was a start.

565
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:10,625
Goodbye, Gwen.

566
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:13,298
Oh, uh bye Gwen.

567
00:30:13,705 --> 00:30:14,637
Bye...

568
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:15,997
Sexual.

569
00:30:18,576 --> 00:30:22,307
Sorry about all that. That's
just Gwen.

570
00:30:23,481 --> 00:30:25,346
Oh, I totally dig her. She's
great.

571
00:30:30,154 --> 00:30:37,651
Seems like every time I find
it's a girl. Straight boys must have it so easy.

572
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:39,862
I wouidn't say that.

573
00:30:40,131 --> 00:30:43,396
Oh come on, perfect girls are
everywhere. it's cruel.

574
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:49,599
I'm sorry, am I making you
nervous?

575
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:51,169
Not at all.

576
00:30:53,678 --> 00:30:55,168
I'm making you nervous.

577
00:30:57,582 --> 00:30:58,480
No, it's okay.

578
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:05,922
So, I gotta warn you. They're
all music-types at this party.

579
00:31:06,457 --> 00:31:09,290
Classical musicians. A little
offbeat.

580
00:31:10,595 --> 00:31:11,459
That means crazy.

581
00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:11,790
Yeah.

582
00:31:17,035 --> 00:31:17,933
You like classical?

583
00:31:19,904 --> 00:31:25,865
Hello! Sweetheart! Oo! Who is
this?

584
00:31:26,778 --> 00:31:30,612
Caleb, this is Richard. And his
wife Miko.

585
00:31:35,253 --> 00:31:40,020
And so the program spelled
Beethoven- B-E-A-T...

586
00:31:45,063 --> 00:31:47,156
So Caleb , what do you do?

587
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:48,324
um.

588
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,423
He goes to the u.

589
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:53,159
Wonderful! So how long have
you two been an item?

590
00:31:53,471 --> 00:31:54,301
Ronnie!

591
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:55,673
Please!

592
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,640
We kinda just met.

593
00:31:57,942 --> 00:32:03,278
That's so sweet! The two of
you look so cute together.

594
00:32:03,915 --> 00:32:06,509
Like a couple ofJudds or
Culkins.

595
00:32:06,985 --> 00:32:09,579
Caleb, have you heard Marc
play?

596
00:32:10,621 --> 00:32:11,019
No.

597
00:32:11,589 --> 00:32:15,923
Well you must. He is the most
this school's had in years.

598
00:32:16,461 --> 00:32:21,990
it's divine. Marc, you have to
play something before you leave.

599
00:32:22,266 --> 00:32:24,666
I thought we were going to do
eight hands two pianos later.

600
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:27,469
Yes! Richard! Set that up!

601
00:32:32,043 --> 00:32:34,807
Caleb. Why don't you turn
pages for Marc and Winston.

602
00:32:35,947 --> 00:32:38,245
Just turn the page as fast as
you can when I nod.

603
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:40,508
You'll do fine.

604
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:43,712
Ready?...

605
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:48,282
And.

606
00:33:13,751 --> 00:33:14,149
Turn!

607
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:14,747
Oh!

608
00:33:18,723 --> 00:33:19,212
Sorry.

609
00:33:51,556 --> 00:33:52,352
Turn!

610
00:34:31,863 --> 00:34:34,263
That was so cool, man. You
guys were awesome.

611
00:34:35,299 --> 00:34:36,323
You really had a good time?

612
00:34:36,901 --> 00:34:39,470
it was great! That Ronnie's a
character.

613
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:43,429
Yeah, I have some weird
friends.

614
00:34:44,008 --> 00:34:46,738
They were fun, though. And
you're great on the piano.

615
00:34:48,012 --> 00:34:49,843
Well, I'm also a flautist.

616
00:34:50,982 --> 00:34:52,006
Just eat less beans.

617
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,244
Have you seen this one?

618
00:34:58,789 --> 00:34:59,448
I don't think so.

619
00:35:00,158 --> 00:35:01,455
it's really good.

620
00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:06,022
Your next appointment?

621
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:08,597
Yeah?

622
00:35:09,133 --> 00:35:09,792
What're you guys doing?

623
00:35:10,501 --> 00:35:11,092
it's just Kyle.

624
00:35:11,702 --> 00:35:12,361
He asked about me?!

625
00:35:12,904 --> 00:35:13,165
No.

626
00:35:13,638 --> 00:35:14,434
Has he mentioned me?

627
00:35:14,805 --> 00:35:15,794
No. What do you want?

628
00:35:16,674 --> 00:35:17,504
Well, what're you guys doing?

629
00:35:18,342 --> 00:35:19,536
Renting videos.

630
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:20,406
What?!

631
00:35:21,312 --> 00:35:22,404
I can't believe you're going
along with this.

632
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,105
This is sick.

633
00:35:24,682 --> 00:35:26,547
I'm in a video store. I can't
really talk.

634
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:27,846
Pronto?

635
00:35:28,219 --> 00:35:28,446
Hey.

636
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,089
I'm at Debbie Milford's. Am i
hang over night here?

637
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,958
Renting a video is code for
having sex.

638
00:35:35,626 --> 00:35:36,251
You're paranoid.

639
00:35:36,727 --> 00:35:37,989
Renting a video?

640
00:35:38,462 --> 00:35:40,054
So I am staying the night.

641
00:35:40,565 --> 00:35:42,556
Gwen, he's so cute.

642
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:45,258
What else is gonna happen?
Two gay men

643
00:35:45,336 --> 00:35:46,462
sitting on a couch,

644
00:35:46,537 --> 00:35:47,638
boring movie,

645
00:35:47,638 --> 00:35:51,130
raging hard-ons. it's the code
you rent a video, you get laid.

646
00:35:53,744 --> 00:35:55,837
Dude, you said there was no
such thing as Gayspeak.

647
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:57,876
Well I was wrong. Do not go
home with him.

648
00:35:58,416 --> 00:35:59,246
Gwen's gonna be there.

649
00:35:59,684 --> 00:36:01,117
Only if she's a bad fag hag.

650
00:36:01,385 --> 00:36:03,580
Gwen honey, yourturn.

651
00:36:04,722 --> 00:36:05,780
Just a second.

652
00:36:06,357 --> 00:36:07,984
Take yourtime sweetie.

653
00:36:08,326 --> 00:36:09,452
We have all night long.

654
00:36:09,894 --> 00:36:11,327
Caleb, this is so not cool.

655
00:36:11,729 --> 00:36:12,753
Nothing's gonna happen.

656
00:36:13,531 --> 00:36:15,522
Plus, I can tell Gwen's into
me. it's working.

657
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:17,594
Of course she's into you.
You're gay.

658
00:36:17,835 --> 00:36:18,802
Shut the fuck up.

659
00:36:21,105 --> 00:36:24,438
God, Gwen he is so... unh.

660
00:36:25,042 --> 00:36:28,978
Well sweetie, if you don't
please-please-please call me so I can come home.

661
00:36:29,447 --> 00:36:30,209
Okay.

662
00:36:30,514 --> 00:36:32,243
Swear on your Simon Rex
jackoff video?

663
00:36:32,717 --> 00:36:33,411
No fair!

664
00:36:33,751 --> 00:36:35,480
Look, don't you get bi-curious
now.

665
00:36:35,953 --> 00:36:37,443
if she's not home, I outta
there.

666
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:40,321
Keep your hands off my man.

667
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:41,589
I'm hanging up.

668
00:36:42,927 --> 00:36:43,791
Okay, he's getting off.

669
00:36:48,466 --> 00:36:49,125
So.

670
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:52,032
You seen

671
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:53,861
any of these?

672
00:36:58,709 --> 00:36:59,539
Gwen?

673
00:37:01,779 --> 00:37:02,905
Gwen?

674
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:05,781
Hmm.

675
00:37:06,817 --> 00:37:08,148
I thought she'd be back.

676
00:37:12,723 --> 00:37:14,850
Well, at least we got the
place to ourselves.

677
00:37:15,726 --> 00:37:17,455
Go ahead, make yourseif at
home.

678
00:37:18,729 --> 00:37:22,825
And when I say that I mean
and roll around on the floor.

679
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:26,395
Gwen?

680
00:37:26,771 --> 00:37:28,238
Trust me, if she was here,

681
00:37:28,773 --> 00:37:30,707
she'd be all up in our pubes.

682
00:37:33,778 --> 00:37:34,506
So.

683
00:37:36,113 --> 00:37:37,045
Video?

684
00:37:38,983 --> 00:37:39,642
Huh?

685
00:37:41,252 --> 00:37:43,186
You know, that thing we
rented.

686
00:37:43,587 --> 00:37:44,417
Oh yeah.

687
00:37:45,823 --> 00:37:46,847
We could watch it.

688
00:37:49,093 --> 00:37:49,525
Yeah.

689
00:37:50,294 --> 00:37:51,522
Or...

690
00:37:52,863 --> 00:37:53,761
Or?

691
00:37:54,365 --> 00:37:56,390
Orwe could not watch it.

692
00:37:59,837 --> 00:38:00,235
Oh.

693
00:38:02,807 --> 00:38:05,037
it's up to you. I'm cool either
way.

694
00:38:40,111 --> 00:38:40,634
Oh, sorry.

695
00:38:48,486 --> 00:38:49,714
That was really good.

696
00:38:51,956 --> 00:38:52,684
Yeah.

697
00:38:54,925 --> 00:38:55,550
So.

698
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,793
Gwen's still not back.

699
00:38:58,295 --> 00:38:59,728
She usually is by now.

700
00:39:02,533 --> 00:39:03,363
it's getting late.

701
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:05,530
Yeah, I'm getting tired too.

702
00:39:07,738 --> 00:39:09,171
I should probably...

703
00:39:13,144 --> 00:39:13,610
Yeah.

704
00:39:18,282 --> 00:39:18,805
Hello?

705
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,781
You answered? You fuck!

706
00:39:21,218 --> 00:39:21,843
Gwen!

707
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,552
What's going on?

708
00:39:23,954 --> 00:39:25,683
Cause if you were fucking you
wouldn't be answering.

709
00:39:25,956 --> 00:39:29,551
And if you're not fucking, you
telling me I can fucking come home.

710
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:33,296
Yeah, Caleb's here. We just
watched a video.

711
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:35,124
You actually watched it?

712
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:40,127
Look, Debbie had one her
so they put me in her dead Grandma's room.

713
00:39:41,439 --> 00:39:43,373
it's really creepy in here.

714
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:46,267
We thought you'd be back by
now.

715
00:39:46,677 --> 00:39:48,110
Ha. Fucking. Ha.

716
00:39:48,379 --> 00:39:50,006
I'm dying la muerta loca here.

717
00:39:50,314 --> 00:39:53,772
Yeah, maybe he can stay and
we can all three hang out some.

718
00:39:54,218 --> 00:39:57,346
So you're that desperate.
Hasn't anyone made a move yet?

719
00:39:58,055 --> 00:39:59,488
Yeah, the movie was great.

720
00:40:00,057 --> 00:40:02,287
Oh God. Marc, let me talk to
him.

721
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:03,655
What?

722
00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:06,288
Put him on, let me get the
balls rolling.

723
00:40:08,065 --> 00:40:08,554
um.

724
00:40:09,133 --> 00:40:10,657
She wants to talk to you.

725
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:12,198
Really?

726
00:40:13,037 --> 00:40:13,366
Yeah.

727
00:40:14,305 --> 00:40:14,999
Here he is.

728
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:16,604
Marc, don't fucking waste
this.

729
00:40:21,178 --> 00:40:21,803
Hello?

730
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,104
HI Caleb.

731
00:40:25,149 --> 00:40:26,047
How was the date?

732
00:40:27,785 --> 00:40:28,615
um. Huh.

733
00:40:29,253 --> 00:40:31,221
Oh, I guess you can't answer,
because he's right there.

734
00:40:32,323 --> 00:40:32,755
Yeah.

735
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:33,915
Okay,

736
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:38,252
let's play a game. You wanna
play with me?

737
00:40:39,163 --> 00:40:39,993
Okay. Sure.

738
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:45,058
I'll try to figure it all out,
while you just say yes or no. Okay?

739
00:40:45,603 --> 00:40:46,228
Yes.

740
00:40:46,937 --> 00:40:47,869
Good start. 01:40:43:28

741
00:40:48,506 --> 00:40:49,234
Hmmm.

742
00:40:50,808 --> 00:40:51,740
Have you done anything?

743
00:40:53,077 --> 00:40:53,600
No.

744
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:55,435
Are you nervous?

745
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,407
Yes, definitely.

746
00:40:59,283 --> 00:41:00,978
But...are you excited?

747
00:41:03,287 --> 00:41:04,117
I guess.

748
00:41:04,855 --> 00:41:05,879
Very excited?

749
00:41:07,925 --> 00:41:08,550
I dunno.

750
00:41:10,094 --> 00:41:10,617
Hmm.

751
00:41:11,228 --> 00:41:13,321
Could you get very excited?

752
00:41:15,299 --> 00:41:15,822
Yeah.

753
00:41:16,567 --> 00:41:19,001
is this exciting you?

754
00:41:21,338 --> 00:41:21,963
Yes.

755
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,467
I can make you less nervous.

756
00:41:24,909 --> 00:41:25,637
Close your eyes.

757
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,142
Huh?

758
00:41:27,878 --> 00:41:29,140
Come on, just play along.

759
00:41:29,847 --> 00:41:31,075
Close your eyes.

760
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:33,382
Okay.

761
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:34,743
Closed?

762
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:36,051
Yes.

763
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:38,413
Tight?

764
00:41:40,157 --> 00:41:40,987
Yes.

765
00:41:41,892 --> 00:41:43,223
Now lean back,

766
00:41:44,528 --> 00:41:45,825
very

767
00:41:46,864 --> 00:41:48,126
slowly.

768
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:53,094
Okay.

769
00:41:54,705 --> 00:41:56,036
Do you like my voice?

770
00:41:56,807 --> 00:41:57,432
Yes.

771
00:41:58,242 --> 00:41:59,800
it's comforting, isn't it?

772
00:42:00,511 --> 00:42:01,034
Yes.

773
00:42:02,212 --> 00:42:03,543
I like yours too.

774
00:42:04,348 --> 00:42:05,576
it's sexy.

775
00:42:07,685 --> 00:42:08,913
is mine sexy?

776
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,445
Yes.

777
00:42:11,188 --> 00:42:13,520
You sound really sexy.

778
00:42:18,896 --> 00:42:19,521
Yeah.

779
00:42:20,598 --> 00:42:21,257
Now

780
00:42:22,566 --> 00:42:27,526
just feel your heart pumping
the blood through your body.

781
00:42:29,807 --> 00:42:31,035
I can feel mine.

782
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:33,540
Can you feel it?

783
00:42:34,645 --> 00:42:35,270
Yes.

784
00:42:35,946 --> 00:42:38,881
Feel it traveling from your
heart.

785
00:42:40,117 --> 00:42:41,049
Through your chest.

786
00:42:42,653 --> 00:42:47,181
up and down your arms and
legs.

787
00:42:49,293 --> 00:42:52,228
in your fingers and toes.

788
00:42:55,165 --> 00:42:56,097
Can you feel it?

789
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,428
Yes.

790
00:42:58,102 --> 00:42:59,228
is it going faster?

791
00:43:00,137 --> 00:43:01,069
Yes.

792
00:43:01,372 --> 00:43:03,101
is it getting warmer?

793
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:04,871
Yes.

794
00:43:06,677 --> 00:43:08,144
What kind of shirt are you
wearing?

795
00:43:09,246 --> 00:43:10,372
um-

796
00:43:10,447 --> 00:43:12,847
I mean is it a pullover?

797
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:13,515
No.

798
00:43:14,985 --> 00:43:16,509
Does it button up?

799
00:43:17,121 --> 00:43:17,746
Yes.

800
00:43:19,323 --> 00:43:21,257
Do you want to unbutton it?

801
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:23,287
Yes.

802
00:43:23,794 --> 00:43:25,318
Open the top button.

803
00:43:27,131 --> 00:43:28,298
Okay.

804
00:43:28,298 --> 00:43:29,526
Keep your eyes closed.

805
00:43:32,136 --> 00:43:33,068
is it open?

806
00:43:33,704 --> 00:43:34,432
Yes.

807
00:43:34,972 --> 00:43:36,405
Are your eyes still closed?

808
00:43:37,207 --> 00:43:37,730
Yes.

809
00:43:39,109 --> 00:43:40,542
I want you to breathe with
me.

810
00:43:42,046 --> 00:43:44,071
Try to match my breathing,
okay?

811
00:43:44,882 --> 00:43:45,610
Okay.

812
00:44:02,533 --> 00:44:04,068
Hey!

813
00:44:04,068 --> 00:44:05,626
Oh! Sorry.

814
00:44:05,969 --> 00:44:06,901
You scared me, man.

815
00:44:08,105 --> 00:44:09,436
Caleb, what's going on?

816
00:44:10,107 --> 00:44:11,438
um, nothing, uh.

817
00:44:13,944 --> 00:44:15,172
Did Marc touch you?

818
00:44:15,979 --> 00:44:16,308
Yes.

819
00:44:17,715 --> 00:44:18,647
Did he hurt you?

820
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:20,782
No.

821
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:22,743
Did it feel good.

822
00:44:25,222 --> 00:44:27,156
I don't know, this is
embarrassing, man.

823
00:44:27,391 --> 00:44:29,825
Yes or no. Did it feel good?

824
00:44:31,495 --> 00:44:32,519
I don't know.

825
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:33,954
Lie down Caleb.

826
00:44:35,466 --> 00:44:36,398
What are you doing?

827
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,832
Do you want me to hang up?

828
00:44:38,235 --> 00:44:39,065
No.

829
00:44:40,304 --> 00:44:41,328
Are you lying down?

830
00:44:47,511 --> 00:44:48,239
Yes.

831
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,109
Eyes closed?

832
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:55,443
Yes.

833
00:44:57,387 --> 00:44:58,911
it's okay you're a virgin.

834
00:44:59,823 --> 00:45:03,281
I'm not gonna let anything
that you don't want. Okay?

835
00:45:04,094 --> 00:45:04,719
Okay.

836
00:45:05,129 --> 00:45:06,994
You wanna stop you say so,
okay?

837
00:45:07,598 --> 00:45:08,223
Okay.

838
00:45:09,633 --> 00:45:10,759
Do you want me to hang up?

839
00:45:11,568 --> 00:45:12,034
No.

840
00:45:13,103 --> 00:45:13,899
Okay.

841
00:45:16,974 --> 00:45:18,498
Breathe slowly.

842
00:45:20,611 --> 00:45:22,272
Deeply.

843
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,804
Just like before.

844
00:45:29,286 --> 00:45:31,015
is your shirt still open?

845
00:45:32,055 --> 00:45:33,079
Yes.

846
00:45:36,093 --> 00:45:38,027
Ask Marc to massage your
neck.

847
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:42,996
Go on.

848
00:45:46,503 --> 00:45:47,162
Marc?

849
00:45:49,873 --> 00:45:50,703
uh-huh?

850
00:45:52,643 --> 00:45:53,940
Will you massage my neck?

851
00:45:54,344 --> 00:45:55,208
Please.

852
00:45:55,712 --> 00:45:56,440
Please?

853
00:45:59,683 --> 00:46:01,116
Don't open your eyes now.

854
00:46:01,785 --> 00:46:04,618
I want your entire world to be
only my voice.

855
00:46:05,155 --> 00:46:05,780
Okay.

856
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:09,684
My voice and his hands.

857
00:46:13,964 --> 00:46:15,192
is he doing it?

858
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:17,525
Yes.

859
00:46:18,502 --> 00:46:19,628
Does it feel good?

860
00:46:23,507 --> 00:46:24,132
Yes.

861
00:46:25,442 --> 00:46:27,010
He use to do that to me.

862
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:30,377
it feals real good.

863
00:46:33,951 --> 00:46:34,781
Yes.

864
00:46:37,254 --> 00:46:38,881
Keep breathing like me.

865
00:46:42,593 --> 00:46:44,527
Do you like hearing my
breathing?

866
00:46:45,262 --> 00:46:45,887
Yes.

867
00:46:46,797 --> 00:46:47,821
it's kinky, isn't it?

868
00:46:48,532 --> 00:46:49,260
Yes.

869
00:46:50,701 --> 00:46:52,225
Are you turned on?

870
00:46:52,903 --> 00:46:54,097
Yes.

871
00:46:54,171 --> 00:46:55,763
I am so turned on.

872
00:46:57,074 --> 00:46:58,098
Do you mind?

873
00:46:58,342 --> 00:46:59,570
No.

874
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:02,239
Do you want me to stay on
the phone?

875
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,010
Yes.

876
00:47:05,349 --> 00:47:06,577
Are you hard?

877
00:47:07,017 --> 00:47:08,245
Yes.

878
00:47:09,386 --> 00:47:10,045
Oh!

879
00:47:10,587 --> 00:47:11,713
What's he doing?

880
00:47:12,656 --> 00:47:14,317
Kissing my neck.

881
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:15,990
Does it feel good?

882
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:17,521
Yes.

883
00:47:17,995 --> 00:47:19,553
is his mouth warm?

884
00:47:20,731 --> 00:47:22,460
Yes.

885
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,931
Tell him to unbutton your
shirt.

886
00:47:25,269 --> 00:47:27,999
unbutton my shirt.

887
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:29,771
Please.

888
00:47:30,407 --> 00:47:32,034
Please.

889
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,115
is he doing it?

890
00:47:43,453 --> 00:47:45,080
Does it feel good?

891
00:47:46,056 --> 00:47:47,182
Yes.

892
00:47:48,992 --> 00:47:49,515
Caleb.

893
00:47:50,661 --> 00:47:51,491
Yes?

894
00:47:52,763 --> 00:47:53,889
Are you still excited?

895
00:47:54,531 --> 00:47:55,498
Yes.

896
00:47:56,633 --> 00:47:57,759
What's he doing to you?

897
00:48:01,471 --> 00:48:02,904
He's licking my stomach.

898
00:48:03,974 --> 00:48:05,498
Does it turn you on?

899
00:48:05,876 --> 00:48:06,706
Yes.

900
00:48:07,744 --> 00:48:09,609
Tell him to unbutton your
pants.

901
00:48:10,247 --> 00:48:10,975
But...

902
00:48:11,448 --> 00:48:12,881
You're having fun, aren't
you?

903
00:48:13,583 --> 00:48:15,686
Yes.

904
00:48:15,686 --> 00:48:17,916
Do you want to lose your
virginity with me?

905
00:48:20,691 --> 00:48:21,715
Yeah.

906
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,686
You're raging hard, aren't
you.

907
00:48:25,796 --> 00:48:26,524
Yes.

908
00:48:27,097 --> 00:48:29,258
A nice wet mouth

909
00:48:30,467 --> 00:48:32,799
would feel so good right now,
wouldn't it.

910
00:48:33,203 --> 00:48:34,568
Yes.

911
00:48:35,205 --> 00:48:36,729
Then tell him to unbutton
your pants.

912
00:48:36,873 --> 00:48:38,500
unbutton my pants...

913
00:48:38,809 --> 00:48:39,639
please.

914
00:48:39,943 --> 00:48:40,671
Please.

915
00:48:44,648 --> 00:48:46,377
Okay, Caleb

916
00:48:47,184 --> 00:48:49,482
I really wanna make you feel
good.

917
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,748
Do you want to feel good?

918
00:48:51,955 --> 00:48:53,081
Yes.

919
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:54,684
Say it.

920
00:48:55,092 --> 00:48:56,684
I wanna feel good.

921
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,387
Beg for it.

922
00:48:59,196 --> 00:49:00,720
Make me feel good.

923
00:49:02,032 --> 00:49:03,465
Please.

924
00:49:09,473 --> 00:49:10,599
Oh!

925
00:49:11,241 --> 00:49:12,674
What's he doing?

926
00:49:12,743 --> 00:49:14,267
His mouth-

927
00:49:14,344 --> 00:49:15,811
is he sucking you off?

928
00:49:16,246 --> 00:49:17,679
Yes.

929
00:49:19,116 --> 00:49:20,140
You like that?

930
00:49:22,252 --> 00:49:23,276
Yes.

931
00:49:24,621 --> 00:49:25,383
Does it feel good?

932
00:49:25,722 --> 00:49:26,552
Yes.

933
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:28,492
Do you want him to stop?

934
00:49:28,492 --> 00:49:29,516
No.

935
00:49:29,826 --> 00:49:30,952
Do you wanna come?

936
00:49:31,328 --> 00:49:33,592
Yes- Oh my god!

937
00:49:34,865 --> 00:49:37,834
Oh fuck. Jesus.

938
00:49:37,968 --> 00:49:39,196
Do you want me to come?

939
00:49:39,636 --> 00:49:40,504
Yes.

940
00:49:40,504 --> 00:49:41,436
I'm gonna come.

941
00:49:41,505 --> 00:49:42,199
Yes.

942
00:49:42,572 --> 00:49:43,368
I'm gonna come!

943
00:49:44,741 --> 00:49:45,673
Ah!

944
00:49:45,976 --> 00:49:46,840
Fuck.

945
00:50:07,931 --> 00:50:09,262
Let me get you a towel.

946
00:50:16,339 --> 00:50:18,068
So how was your first time?

947
00:50:19,009 --> 00:50:20,033
Fuck.

948
00:50:20,243 --> 00:50:24,202
I don't even know.

949
00:50:25,949 --> 00:50:26,574
Did it

950
00:50:27,284 --> 00:50:29,411
weird you out to have a girl
on the phone.

951
00:50:30,687 --> 00:50:32,814
Not at all.

952
00:50:34,858 --> 00:50:35,984
You're kinky.

953
00:50:37,127 --> 00:50:37,991
I like you.

954
00:50:40,697 --> 00:50:42,528
I like you too. You're dirty.

955
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,065
I'm filthy.

956
00:50:47,104 --> 00:50:47,934
Where's Marc?

957
00:50:48,271 --> 00:50:48,896
Ah...

958
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:51,299
Getting a towel.

959
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:52,640
Did he come?

960
00:50:53,276 --> 00:50:54,800
I don't know.

961
00:50:56,146 --> 00:50:56,908
Well,

962
00:50:57,347 --> 00:50:59,645
it's safe for me to come
home now anyhow.

963
00:51:00,851 --> 00:51:01,783
I'll be there soon.

964
00:51:02,219 --> 00:51:03,386
Oh, okay.

965
00:51:03,386 --> 00:51:04,011
Buh-bye.

966
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:14,455
Here.

967
00:51:15,198 --> 00:51:16,028
Thanks.

968
00:51:21,972 --> 00:51:23,132
You mind if I get off?

969
00:51:25,342 --> 00:51:25,865
Huh?

970
00:51:26,943 --> 00:51:28,570
I can take care of myself.

971
00:51:29,279 --> 00:51:30,211
You just sit there.

972
00:51:41,858 --> 00:51:44,986
So, Gwen said she's on her
way.

973
00:51:51,168 --> 00:51:53,500
I like your TV set up. it's
pretty

974
00:51:54,404 --> 00:51:55,871
hi-tech and stuff.

975
00:52:15,058 --> 00:52:15,888
Thanks.

976
00:52:17,761 --> 00:52:19,991
I didn't do anything.

977
00:52:21,064 --> 00:52:21,996
You did good.

978
00:52:24,267 --> 00:52:25,791
You want this?

980
00:52:29,378 --> 00:52:30,675
Oh I don't normally...

981
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:32,605
What?

982
00:52:35,584 --> 00:52:36,812
Make that much.

983
00:52:38,687 --> 00:52:40,120
I should go.

984
00:52:41,857 --> 00:52:44,690
Yeah. Sure. Thanks.

985
00:52:47,096 --> 00:52:49,030
You're welcome.

986
00:52:50,733 --> 00:52:51,757
I'll call you.

987
00:52:53,802 --> 00:52:55,030
Yeah! Call me.

988
00:53:22,502 --> 00:53:23,332
Drive safe.

989
00:53:25,071 --> 00:53:25,799
Yeah, you too.

990
00:54:27,934 --> 00:54:30,095
Wish I had your cell, I woulda
called instead of stopping.

991
00:54:30,503 --> 00:54:31,970
I'm glad you stopped.

992
00:54:32,238 --> 00:54:33,000
You want my cell?

993
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,464
Abba-solutely.

994
00:54:34,708 --> 00:54:35,640
Let me get mine.

995
00:54:38,645 --> 00:54:40,272
Let's fast forward through
the small talk.

996
00:54:40,647 --> 00:54:41,875
I want to know how it went.

997
00:54:45,618 --> 00:54:46,084
Went?

998
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,344
You just made it with your
first guy!

999
00:54:54,794 --> 00:54:55,726
Aren't you happy?

1000
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:58,561
I'm confused.

1001
00:54:59,733 --> 00:55:01,200
Didn't it feel good?

1002
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:08,699
Shit, I was too pushy.

1003
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:15,571
Honey, Marc's a good guy.

1004
00:55:15,849 --> 00:55:16,372
The best. You're in good
hands.

1005
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,409
it's just too much-

1006
00:55:21,488 --> 00:55:22,386
Too soon?

1007
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:25,055
No, not that, I don't know.

1008
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:26,319
We're all just people.

1009
00:55:26,926 --> 00:55:29,394
Just bodies with organic
needs.

1010
00:55:29,863 --> 00:55:33,026
We need satisfaction. We
shouldn't deny our bodies.

1011
00:55:38,571 --> 00:55:39,799
Are you turned on?

1012
00:55:40,974 --> 00:55:42,566
No, that's just my-

1013
00:55:43,643 --> 00:55:45,372
You're still turned on.

1014
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,639
You've had a boner since you
left Marc?

1015
00:55:48,715 --> 00:55:49,272
No!

1016
00:55:49,983 --> 00:55:53,350
Don't be embarrassed. That's
how it is the first time you do it,

1017
00:55:54,354 --> 00:55:55,685
you just wanna do it again.

1018
00:56:00,894 --> 00:56:02,225
You mind me doing this?

1019
00:56:03,029 --> 00:56:03,586
No.

1020
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:08,698
How about this?

1021
00:56:15,642 --> 00:56:19,669
Don't you think we should, uh,
I mean we're in public.

1022
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:23,276
I think it's sexy you're
worried about Marc,

1023
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:26,250
but it seems to me that Marc
didn't do his job.

1024
00:56:33,126 --> 00:56:34,058
Calm down.

1025
00:56:34,661 --> 00:56:35,992
it's fine, I'm just-

1026
00:56:36,062 --> 00:56:36,960
Suck that.

1027
00:56:37,964 --> 00:56:40,330
And don't give me any
strictly gay shit.

1028
00:56:42,402 --> 00:56:44,768
Who needs friends that won't
fuck friends?

1029
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:48,932
Eat it little gay boy!

1030
00:56:50,443 --> 00:56:52,536
Yeah! Whoa!

1031
00:56:53,246 --> 00:56:54,508
That's your perineum.

1032
00:56:55,114 --> 00:56:56,945
You are such a fag.

1033
00:56:59,552 --> 00:57:00,610
Why, you back so late?

1034
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:02,479
Can we talk about this in the
morning?

1035
00:57:02,555 --> 00:57:05,353
Caleb! Fuckin-A, what
happened? Did you do it with Gwen?

1036
00:57:06,092 --> 00:57:06,717
Sort of.

1037
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,022
Well, did you talk about me?

1038
00:57:10,363 --> 00:57:10,988
Caleb?

1039
00:57:12,532 --> 00:57:13,464
Hello?

1040
00:57:46,866 --> 00:57:47,525
Good morning!

1041
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,125
Wait forthe beep and tell me
something I don't know.

1042
00:57:52,438 --> 00:57:53,405
This is for Caleb.

1043
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,672
You're probably sleeping. i
I had a great time last night.

1044
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:57,833
Really.

1045
00:57:58,244 --> 00:57:59,802
So I just wanted to call,

1046
00:57:59,879 --> 00:58:01,540
ecause lots of guys have a
thing about calling,

1047
00:58:01,614 --> 00:58:04,276
where you don't call, and
and see who calls first.

1048
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:06,181
And well, I didn't wanna.

1049
00:58:06,819 --> 00:58:08,480
Geeze, I sound really stupid.

1050
00:58:09,522 --> 00:58:11,581
Anyway, call me. Mwah.

1051
00:58:12,825 --> 00:58:13,792
Okay bye.

1052
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:14,758
What the fuck?

1053
00:58:16,663 --> 00:58:17,425
Shit.

1054
00:58:19,666 --> 00:58:21,133
Kyle, I'm sorry.

1055
00:58:22,168 --> 00:58:22,930
Fuck you!

1056
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,198
it's not what you think.

1057
00:58:36,416 --> 00:58:37,178
Hello?

1058
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:39,480
Oh shit. it's Marc.

1059
00:58:39,552 --> 00:58:41,315
I'm sorry, did I wake you?

1060
00:58:42,655 --> 00:58:44,816
No. I just got your message.

1061
00:58:45,258 --> 00:58:47,226
God, I feel like a stalker.

1062
00:58:47,493 --> 00:58:50,690
I just realized I didn't leave
thought I'd call leave it on your machine.

1063
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:52,461
I didn't think you'd answer.

1064
00:58:53,633 --> 00:58:54,600
No, that's fine.

1065
00:58:55,068 --> 00:58:57,536
Well, it's nice to talk to you
anyhow.

1066
00:58:58,137 --> 00:58:59,365
I'm sorry, were you busy?

1067
00:58:59,439 --> 00:59:02,772
No. Just... recovering.

1068
00:59:15,989 --> 00:59:17,650
You must be one fuck of a
fuck.

1069
00:59:26,265 --> 00:59:27,129
That was him.

1070
00:59:31,371 --> 00:59:32,838
Marc's the asshole type.

1071
00:59:34,474 --> 00:59:37,739
He normally fucks and moves
on. But I guess with you.

1072
00:59:38,778 --> 00:59:39,836
I mean who wouidn't want
to...

1073
00:59:41,147 --> 00:59:42,114
keep you around.

1074
00:59:45,284 --> 00:59:47,149
How could you fuckin do this
to me?

1075
00:59:48,988 --> 00:59:50,546
That's not fair. it's not like
you guys even-

1076
00:59:50,623 --> 00:59:52,147
You don't even know, do you?

1077
00:59:54,093 --> 00:59:55,253
You're so stupid.

1078
00:59:56,863 --> 00:59:58,330
Well, I invited them over for
dinner.

1079
01:00:00,733 --> 01:00:01,290
Here?

1080
01:00:03,403 --> 01:00:03,869
Great

1081
01:00:05,004 --> 01:00:06,471
you guys can just make out in
front of me.

1082
01:00:07,106 --> 01:00:08,164
Wanna screw in my bed?

1083
01:00:09,275 --> 01:00:10,537
I invited Gwen too.

1084
01:00:11,678 --> 01:00:13,441
We're all gonna sit down and
tell the truth.

1085
01:00:14,414 --> 01:00:15,073
And just. Just...

1086
01:00:15,915 --> 01:00:16,677
Just what?

1087
01:00:18,418 --> 01:00:18,884
Huh?

1088
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:24,283
Things are so simple in your
aren't they?

1089
01:00:26,526 --> 01:00:28,084
Well, Caleb, it doesn't work
that way.

1090
01:00:29,729 --> 01:00:31,959
Things are a lot more
complicated than just sitting around

1091
01:00:32,031 --> 01:00:33,589
telling people how you really
feel.

1092
01:00:35,134 --> 01:00:36,692
I'm trying to fix things here.
Okay?

1093
01:00:36,769 --> 01:00:38,703
You're doing a Fabio job so
far.

1094
01:00:42,175 --> 01:00:43,335
Just say you'll come to
dinner.

1095
01:00:47,213 --> 01:00:47,770
Okay?

1096
01:00:48,715 --> 01:00:49,272
Fine!

1097
01:00:50,717 --> 01:00:51,877
I'll be there with balls on.

1098
01:00:54,854 --> 01:00:56,412
You're not planning on
cooking, are you?

1099
01:00:58,124 --> 01:01:00,524
Well, I wasn't gonna ask, but
since you brought it up.

1100
01:01:00,593 --> 01:01:02,527
Fine! I'll cook.

1101
01:01:10,236 --> 01:01:11,396
I'm not that stupid.

1102
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:13,903
I do know.

1103
01:01:16,943 --> 01:01:18,410
if I were gay. Even a little.

1104
01:01:20,546 --> 01:01:21,205
it'd be you.

1105
01:01:44,403 --> 01:01:45,563
Alright, I won't go.

1106
01:01:46,205 --> 01:01:47,672
He wants you to. it's like he's
Tell him I have consumption.

1107
01:01:48,641 --> 01:01:49,903
I shouldn'ta done that last
night.

1108
01:01:52,645 --> 01:01:53,703
it was hot.

1109
01:01:54,213 --> 01:01:55,373
it was fucked up.

1110
01:01:57,817 --> 01:01:58,977
You should've seen him,

1111
01:01:59,051 --> 01:02:00,916
he flew out of here like a
seminal Meatloaf album.

1112
01:02:02,155 --> 01:02:03,918
He seemed to like it on the
phone.

1113
01:02:06,726 --> 01:02:08,387
That's what's so fucked up
about it.

1114
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:12,226
Are you jealous?

1115
01:02:13,533 --> 01:02:14,295
No.

1116
01:02:15,334 --> 01:02:16,392
You're jealous!

1117
01:02:17,236 --> 01:02:18,396
I am not.

1118
01:02:19,038 --> 01:02:21,268
This is so great!

1119
01:02:21,607 --> 01:02:23,575
it's finally the otherway
around.

1120
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:27,008
Do you know how many boys
just to get to you?

1121
01:02:27,446 --> 01:02:27,935
Shut up.

1122
01:02:29,982 --> 01:02:31,643
You're scared I could convert
him.

1123
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:34,878
Maybe I just will.

1124
01:02:34,954 --> 01:02:35,978
I need to practice.

1125
01:02:36,656 --> 01:02:37,714
I'll take that

1126
01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:38,757
as a challenge.

1127
01:02:39,225 --> 01:02:41,125
I can't hear you, babe.

1128
01:02:42,195 --> 01:02:44,288
I know something you don't
know.

1129
01:02:51,637 --> 01:02:52,797
What the hell are you
making?

1130
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:54,872
Sausages.

1131
01:02:54,941 --> 01:02:57,569
Big fat sausages.

1132
01:02:58,411 --> 01:02:59,810
Dude, people don't eat
sausages.

1133
01:02:59,879 --> 01:03:01,574
You're supposed to make
spaghettI or some shit.

1134
01:03:01,647 --> 01:03:02,671
Fine, you wanna cook?

1135
01:03:03,549 --> 01:03:04,516
No. I mean.

1136
01:03:05,484 --> 01:03:06,815
I never seen you make
sausages.

1137
01:03:07,153 --> 01:03:08,848
Well I'm trying something
new.

1138
01:03:09,689 --> 01:03:10,747
You're making too much.

1139
01:03:10,823 --> 01:03:12,381
I invited some over friends
too. Go get the door.

1140
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:17,151
This isn't a kegger, bro. This
Who'd you invite?

1141
01:03:17,663 --> 01:03:21,326
Like they said to Anne Frank:
the door and find out?

1142
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,894
Oh, it's you guys.

1143
01:03:29,909 --> 01:03:31,171
I brought this for you.

1144
01:03:32,511 --> 01:03:34,706
Cool. it's yellow.

1145
01:03:37,483 --> 01:03:38,745
And some wine.

1146
01:03:40,419 --> 01:03:42,011
Awesome. All we got is beer.

1147
01:03:43,155 --> 01:03:43,814
Cool.

1148
01:03:46,592 --> 01:03:48,389
This is the part where you
invite us in.

1149
01:03:48,728 --> 01:03:52,687
Oh geeze, come in. Kyle's in
the kitchen.

1150
01:03:54,166 --> 01:03:56,191
Honey, this is how you do it.

1151
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:58,434
Ha. Ha.

1152
01:04:00,506 --> 01:04:01,996
Funny. I get it.

1153
01:04:04,176 --> 01:04:05,837
So. Caleb. Marc thinks...

1154
01:04:05,912 --> 01:04:06,606
Hello Gwen.

1155
01:04:08,147 --> 01:04:08,704
Marc.

1156
01:04:09,749 --> 01:04:10,943
Did You offerthem
beverages?

1157
01:04:11,417 --> 01:04:12,509
Oh! Yeah, you guys want
some?

1158
01:04:12,952 --> 01:04:13,919
I'll pour us some drinks.

1159
01:04:13,986 --> 01:04:15,977
You show me where the
glasses are.

1160
01:04:19,692 --> 01:04:20,989
So, what do you think?

1161
01:04:22,795 --> 01:04:23,352
Oh.

1162
01:04:23,796 --> 01:04:25,127
I think.

1163
01:04:26,632 --> 01:04:27,997
I think you're a really nice
guy.

1164
01:04:29,235 --> 01:04:29,792
That's all.

1165
01:04:31,804 --> 01:04:32,361
Thanks.

1166
01:04:32,872 --> 01:04:34,601
I gotta go to the head.

1167
01:04:37,443 --> 01:04:38,239
We need to talk.

1168
01:04:38,311 --> 01:04:39,403
Dude!

1169
01:04:42,081 --> 01:04:43,309
I wasn't being honest.

1170
01:04:43,916 --> 01:04:45,247
I gotta talk about it now, or i
wont-

1171
01:04:45,318 --> 01:04:46,410
I'm takin' a leak.

1172
01:04:46,986 --> 01:04:48,419
Please, I've seen it.

1173
01:04:49,155 --> 01:04:49,849
How you doin'?

1174
01:04:50,323 --> 01:04:51,984
My god. What are those?

1175
01:04:52,758 --> 01:04:53,349
Dinner.

1176
01:04:54,627 --> 01:04:56,595
is this some kind of ethnic
thing?

1177
01:04:57,596 --> 01:04:58,187
Marc,

1178
01:04:59,699 --> 01:05:01,030
I think you're really cool...

1179
01:05:01,901 --> 01:05:02,390
But?

1180
01:05:04,537 --> 01:05:05,026
But...

1181
01:05:08,307 --> 01:05:09,638
is there something with you
and Kyle?

1182
01:05:10,843 --> 01:05:12,333
No. it's definitely not that.

1183
01:05:13,879 --> 01:05:14,903
Oh shit.

1184
01:05:16,415 --> 01:05:18,610
Don't say anything, okay?

1185
01:05:19,318 --> 01:05:20,114
What's wrong.

1186
01:05:27,526 --> 01:05:30,086
HI Mom. Dad. Jamie.

1187
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:32,624
Oh. This is Marc.

1188
01:05:32,698 --> 01:05:35,895
Marc, my family. I was just
flusher-thing. it was broken.

1189
01:05:35,968 --> 01:05:38,698
The bobbing thing. it has to
stay on top.

1190
01:05:39,138 --> 01:05:40,935
it's called a ballcock.

1191
01:05:41,374 --> 01:05:41,738
Well.

1192
01:05:42,108 --> 01:05:43,336
Nice to meet you, Marc.

1193
01:05:43,776 --> 01:05:44,470
Are you gay?

1194
01:05:45,177 --> 01:05:45,666
That's rude.

1195
01:05:46,112 --> 01:05:48,012
Oh please. I don't mind.

1196
01:05:48,514 --> 01:05:50,641
Kyle, I think you need my help
in the kitchen.

1197
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:52,410
Be right back.

1198
01:05:53,619 --> 01:05:55,519
I'm gonna circumcise your
neck.

1199
01:06:00,726 --> 01:06:02,421
I know this looks fucked up.

1200
01:06:02,495 --> 01:06:03,689
You're gonna look fucked up.

1201
01:06:03,763 --> 01:06:06,061
We can't do it yourway. We
can't just tell them.

1202
01:06:06,132 --> 01:06:09,124
They won't give either of us
I have just as much at stake here.

1203
01:06:09,201 --> 01:06:11,601
Kyle, those are my fucking
parents.

1204
01:06:12,171 --> 01:06:13,638
This my life, you know. My
real life.

1205
01:06:13,706 --> 01:06:15,333
Calm down. Trust me, okay?

1206
01:06:18,711 --> 01:06:21,407
Gwen? Marc? Come in for a
sec?

1207
01:06:22,548 --> 01:06:23,139
Well.

1208
01:06:23,983 --> 01:06:24,813
That's us.

1209
01:06:31,257 --> 01:06:32,417
Okay, what's the Kim Deal?

1210
01:06:32,491 --> 01:06:34,391
Caleb's not out to his
parents, yet.

1211
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:35,825
No shit.

1212
01:06:36,996 --> 01:06:37,928
Of course they don't know.

1213
01:06:38,531 --> 01:06:39,225
Should we leave?

1214
01:06:39,298 --> 01:06:40,765
No, that'd look too weird.

1215
01:06:40,833 --> 01:06:43,802
No, I got it worked out.

1216
01:06:44,303 --> 01:06:44,701
Gwen,

1217
01:06:45,204 --> 01:06:46,466
just pretend you're here with
Caleb.

1218
01:06:46,539 --> 01:06:49,474
And Marc can be, uh, my
date.

1219
01:06:50,009 --> 01:06:50,373
What?

1220
01:06:51,077 --> 01:06:52,237
ust for dinner.

1221
01:06:52,311 --> 01:06:54,513
Then they leave and we're
back to normal-

1222
01:06:54,513 --> 01:06:56,037
Everything cool in there
dudes?

1223
01:06:56,115 --> 01:06:57,946
Very cool Mrs. Peterson!

1224
01:06:59,251 --> 01:06:59,979
Now you

1225
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,720
sit next to Caleb.

1226
01:07:04,457 --> 01:07:05,389
And Marc,

1227
01:07:07,159 --> 01:07:07,818
with moi.

1228
01:07:09,161 --> 01:07:11,061
Oh! I get it.

1229
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:12,495
Well if you need anything!

1230
01:07:12,565 --> 01:07:14,157
Let's go meet Mr. and Mrs.
Roper.

1231
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:15,294
Peterson.

1232
01:07:20,573 --> 01:07:23,736
Those were very interesting
sausages, Kyle.

1233
01:07:25,377 --> 01:07:27,646
What flavor exactly is white
jello?

1234
01:07:27,646 --> 01:07:28,581
Well it's just the way the-

1235
01:07:28,581 --> 01:07:30,310
You know what it iooks like, it
looks like-

1236
01:07:31,317 --> 01:07:33,285
So when did you meet this
lovely young lady?

1237
01:07:34,053 --> 01:07:35,452
At a party last week.

1238
01:07:35,521 --> 01:07:37,216
Right afterthe Tiffani
ordeal?

1239
01:07:38,357 --> 01:07:39,225
Who's Tiffani?

1240
01:07:39,225 --> 01:07:40,192
''Beard.''

1241
01:07:40,259 --> 01:07:41,783
You never mentioned Tiffani.

1242
01:07:41,861 --> 01:07:43,328
TiffanI was a bitch.

1243
01:07:43,395 --> 01:07:44,191
I liked her.

1244
01:07:44,263 --> 01:07:45,431
She was cute.

1245
01:07:45,431 --> 01:07:48,958
How did you meet, was it
across a crowded room?

1246
01:07:49,802 --> 01:07:52,100
Well, she was screaming, and
I saw her.

1247
01:07:52,671 --> 01:07:53,399
Screaming?

1248
01:07:53,873 --> 01:07:56,637
I was so surprised he wasn't
gay.

1249
01:07:57,276 --> 01:07:59,176
You must get that all the
time, hon.

1250
01:07:59,245 --> 01:08:00,712
I mean living with Kyle...

1251
01:08:00,779 --> 01:08:01,711
and your haircut.

1252
01:08:02,181 --> 01:08:04,149
So, Marc, when did you meet
Kyle?

1253
01:08:04,583 --> 01:08:06,448
I hope we're not being too
personal,

1254
01:08:06,519 --> 01:08:08,817
but Kyle's like a second son
to us.

1255
01:08:08,888 --> 01:08:09,684
Or daughter.

1256
01:08:11,624 --> 01:08:13,455
it's a small world young
lady...

1257
01:08:13,526 --> 01:08:16,051
...I know, celebrate our
diversity.

1258
01:08:16,128 --> 01:08:17,720
We met at the same party.

1259
01:08:22,801 --> 01:08:23,768
What's this music?

1260
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:25,198
it's really good.

1261
01:08:25,905 --> 01:08:27,395
I don't know, it's Kyle's shit.

1262
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:28,272
Oh.

1263
01:08:29,308 --> 01:08:30,138
Who is this, Kyle?

1264
01:08:30,843 --> 01:08:31,468
it's mine.

1265
01:08:33,012 --> 01:08:34,070
But it's just my old stuff.

1266
01:08:35,114 --> 01:08:35,981
My new stuff's better.

1267
01:08:35,981 --> 01:08:37,278
Kyle's a composer.

1268
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:38,817
Didn't he mention it?

1269
01:08:39,518 --> 01:08:41,713
uh, no. He hasn't mentioned
much.

1270
01:08:43,122 --> 01:08:44,589
sn't his work just beautiful?

1271
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:47,054
Yeah, it's nice.

1272
01:08:48,761 --> 01:08:49,785
You in the music school?

1273
01:08:49,862 --> 01:08:50,556
Yeah.

1274
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:52,395
I never noticed you around.

1275
01:08:53,165 --> 01:08:55,030
You're classical, I'm jazz.

1276
01:08:55,467 --> 01:08:56,263
You know how they are.

1277
01:08:56,335 --> 01:08:57,165
Yeah.

1278
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:02,834
This is really good.

1279
01:09:03,876 --> 01:09:07,107
it's always nice to know
what's going in your lives, boys,

1280
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:10,481
but isn't it a little early to be
meeting the parents?

1281
01:09:10,549 --> 01:09:12,915
I mean, you hardly seem to
know each other.

1282
01:09:13,385 --> 01:09:16,013
I just thought this would be
nice. All of us together.

1283
01:09:16,455 --> 01:09:17,690
One big family.

1284
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:19,123
Betterthan Springer.

1285
01:09:20,726 --> 01:09:22,717
is there something you want
to tell us?

1286
01:09:22,795 --> 01:09:26,492
We're here for you, son.

1287
01:09:26,565 --> 01:09:29,728
Just wanted to have dinner.
No interior motive.

1288
01:09:29,802 --> 01:09:30,564
ulterior.

1289
01:09:30,636 --> 01:09:31,568
I knew that.

1290
01:09:33,539 --> 01:09:34,506
Shit. Now who?

1291
01:09:34,573 --> 01:09:36,268
I didn't invite anyone else.
Honest.

1292
01:09:45,384 --> 01:09:48,717
I hear you have phone
trouble, Miss Thing.

1293
01:09:48,954 --> 01:09:51,354
That's Mister Miss Thing to
you.

1294
01:09:53,058 --> 01:09:53,786
Tiffani?

1295
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,961
You little hose huffer!

1296
01:09:58,530 --> 01:10:00,225
Why don't you come join us?

1297
01:10:00,299 --> 01:10:02,790
Gomez, Morticia and little
Wednesday.

1298
01:10:03,035 --> 01:10:04,935
I'm sure this is awkward for
Gwen.

1299
01:10:05,404 --> 01:10:07,304
I don't mind, I wanna see this.

1300
01:10:23,856 --> 01:10:24,481
You know,

1301
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:27,090
you guys seem really nice.

1302
01:10:28,594 --> 01:10:30,152
Oh my God, Gwen, don't.

1303
01:10:30,663 --> 01:10:33,188
Caleb, honey, I'm gonna do
you a really big favor.

1304
01:10:33,265 --> 01:10:34,129
Oh shit.

1305
01:10:34,199 --> 01:10:36,394
You'll hate me now, but you'll
love me later.

1306
01:10:36,468 --> 01:10:37,400
Gwen, please.

1307
01:10:37,469 --> 01:10:38,060
Shit.

1308
01:10:38,771 --> 01:10:40,102
Mr. and Mrs. Peterson,

1309
01:10:40,472 --> 01:10:47,105
your son is gay.

1310
01:10:47,212 --> 01:10:48,270
Fag. You're it.

1311
01:10:50,349 --> 01:10:52,749
I turned him gay. I can turn
him back!

1312
01:10:53,819 --> 01:10:55,548
Please with that word!

1313
01:10:55,921 --> 01:10:57,786
Caleb and Marc are
boyfriends

1314
01:10:57,856 --> 01:11:00,222
and I'm just Marc's
roommate.

1315
01:11:00,926 --> 01:11:03,326
You're a reality show without
a camera crew.

1316
01:11:12,571 --> 01:11:15,199
We're not boyfriends yet,
we've been on one date.

1317
01:11:15,474 --> 01:11:16,338
I told you.

1318
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:18,435
Son.

1319
01:11:18,911 --> 01:11:21,209
How did we manifest our
homophobia?

1320
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,271
it must have been horrible
living with us.

1321
01:11:23,349 --> 01:11:25,340
Straight this, straight that.

1322
01:11:25,417 --> 01:11:27,908
I'm sorry. You needed all of
this to face us.

1323
01:11:28,153 --> 01:11:31,020
I'll calling Tammy at PFLOG
first thing.

1324
01:11:31,824 --> 01:11:33,189
We'll go to meetings.

1325
01:11:34,193 --> 01:11:37,185
Jamie, hon, is there
something you wanted to tell us?

1326
01:11:37,663 --> 01:11:39,028
Well, I don't think I'm a lesbo.

1327
01:11:39,264 --> 01:11:41,198
I experimented once.

1328
01:11:43,202 --> 01:11:43,827
Son,

1329
01:11:46,071 --> 01:11:47,060
give me a hug.

1330
01:11:53,545 --> 01:11:54,068
Caleb.

1331
01:11:55,147 --> 01:11:56,045
Hug your father.

1332
01:12:06,024 --> 01:12:08,015
You are still my son and l love
you.

1333
01:12:08,761 --> 01:12:10,126
This is so beautiful.

1334
01:12:10,629 --> 01:12:13,359
Barf. You should see them on
anniversaries.

1335
01:12:14,032 --> 01:12:15,431
I love you, Caleb.

1336
01:12:15,501 --> 01:12:16,433
I love you too, Mom.

1337
01:12:16,502 --> 01:12:17,469
I love you, Dad.

1338
01:12:18,237 --> 01:12:20,068
C'mon, family hug.

1339
01:12:23,675 --> 01:12:24,903
Love ya gay bro.

1340
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:26,736
Come on,

1341
01:12:27,346 --> 01:12:29,644
I said family hug. You're all
family here.

1342
01:12:30,716 --> 01:12:32,183
Well, come on!

1343
01:12:34,686 --> 01:12:36,051
Oh, what the fuck!

1344
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:53,098
But, I'm mad.

1345
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,111
I am so proud of you son.

1346
01:13:04,616 --> 01:13:05,844
You take good care of my
boy.

1347
01:13:06,919 --> 01:13:08,386
Yes sir, Mr. Peterson.

1348
01:13:08,454 --> 01:13:09,421
I bet he will.

1349
01:13:09,955 --> 01:13:11,320
I bet he will too.

1350
01:13:12,624 --> 01:13:15,559
No offense Kyle, next time
we're eating out.

1351
01:13:16,395 --> 01:13:18,761
C'mon hon, let's go.

1352
01:13:26,138 --> 01:13:27,264
Do you think I'm stupid?

1353
01:13:27,673 --> 01:13:28,037
No.

1354
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:29,538
Not you, hon.

1355
01:13:30,175 --> 01:13:33,235
Kyle, I know what's going on.
You're acting like a baby.

1356
01:13:33,612 --> 01:13:34,408
I didn't think-

1357
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,914
Well it's time to make a
change in your lifestyle.

1358
01:13:37,616 --> 01:13:38,583
Okay babe,

1359
01:13:38,650 --> 01:13:40,550
this is one of the reasons i
get called a bitch.

1360
01:13:40,986 --> 01:13:42,385
Because I tell it like it is.

1361
01:13:43,489 --> 01:13:44,012
Kyle,

1362
01:13:44,756 --> 01:13:45,552
reality.

1363
01:13:46,291 --> 01:13:47,952
Reality, Kyle.

1364
01:13:48,994 --> 01:13:50,586
You are not in Marc's league.

1365
01:13:51,263 --> 01:13:55,495
I mean you're not a total K-9,
but you are a K-5.

1366
01:13:55,567 --> 01:13:56,591
Gwen, c'moff it.

1367
01:13:56,668 --> 01:13:58,636
Marc's not a K at all.

1368
01:13:59,238 --> 01:14:01,729
Your chances of ever scoring
with someone like Marc?

1369
01:14:02,474 --> 01:14:04,874
Zero. Nothing. El Nacho!

1370
01:14:04,943 --> 01:14:05,671
Gwen, stop.

1371
01:14:05,744 --> 01:14:08,042
Live with it. Move on.

1372
01:14:25,464 --> 01:14:27,261
What? He pulled a dirty fuckin
trick.

1373
01:14:27,332 --> 01:14:28,162
That was harsh.

1374
01:14:28,967 --> 01:14:30,093
Well, would you?

1375
01:14:30,903 --> 01:14:36,102
Would you Marc Everheart
Kyle what's-his-nuts?

1376
01:14:38,744 --> 01:14:39,267
Maybe.

1377
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:43,280
She's right. You wouldn't.
Ever.

1378
01:14:43,682 --> 01:14:45,081
I would too. You don't know
me.

1379
01:14:45,684 --> 01:14:49,313
He's not a nice person. He
was trying to split you guys up.

1380
01:14:50,022 --> 01:14:52,320
I blame him and those who
harbor him.

1381
01:14:52,391 --> 01:14:55,451
You can't possibly be that
stupid. You don't belong to a frat.

1382
01:14:55,527 --> 01:14:56,516
I'm not stupid...

1383
01:14:59,598 --> 01:15:06,231
Look, go talk to him? Kyle is a
He's amazing.

1384
01:15:07,306 --> 01:15:08,330
Then why aren't you with him.

1385
01:15:09,508 --> 01:15:11,533
I would be in a second, but..

1386
01:15:13,779 --> 01:15:15,007
But what, I'm listening.

1387
01:15:15,981 --> 01:15:17,005
it's complicated.

1388
01:15:17,683 --> 01:15:19,708
Christ, now you're talking like
a straight guy.

1389
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:21,515
um.

1390
01:15:23,722 --> 01:15:24,689
Oh shit.

1391
01:15:28,594 --> 01:15:31,028
You fucking heterosexual liar!

1392
01:15:31,763 --> 01:15:32,787
Gwen, I'm sorry, it's...

1393
01:15:32,864 --> 01:15:39,565
You pretended to be gay, had
came out to your parents, just so you could fuck me!

1394
01:15:45,243 --> 01:15:45,902
I guess.

1395
01:15:47,245 --> 01:15:49,014
I can't beiieve I let you fuck
me.

1396
01:15:49,014 --> 01:15:50,811
You fucked her? You fucked
him?

1397
01:15:54,519 --> 01:15:58,512
That is the sweetest thing
anyone has ever done for me.

1398
01:16:01,627 --> 01:16:02,787
I'm really sorry, dude.

1399
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:09,467
Hey, some day I'll look back
it was really hot.

1400
01:16:11,803 --> 01:16:12,462
Me too.

1401
01:16:15,574 --> 01:16:16,370
Talk to him.

1402
01:16:18,944 --> 01:16:22,607
Hey if you hurt him I will
seriously fuck with your shit.

1403
01:16:24,216 --> 01:16:25,274
Back at you with her.

1404
01:16:25,851 --> 01:16:28,319
Oh please, I'll fuck all you all's
shit.

1405
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:39,790
Go away.

1406
01:16:41,166 --> 01:16:41,655
Caleb!

1407
01:16:41,733 --> 01:16:42,097
it's me.

1408
01:16:43,802 --> 01:16:44,200
Oh.

1409
01:16:48,073 --> 01:16:48,630
May i?

1410
01:16:50,375 --> 01:16:57,679
Sure. So, I guess Caleb told
you...

1411
01:16:58,617 --> 01:16:59,174
Yeah.

1412
01:17:01,053 --> 01:17:02,350
I guess he and Gwen are...

1413
01:17:02,421 --> 01:17:03,012
Yeah.

1414
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:11,622
OK listen, I don't think I can
Anthony Michael Hall ''let's be friends'' speech.

1415
01:17:12,497 --> 01:17:15,625
Good, 'cause I don't know one.

1416
01:17:18,537 --> 01:17:19,731
I knew your name was Kyle.

1417
01:17:21,273 --> 01:17:21,568
Huh?

1418
01:17:23,442 --> 01:17:29,745
At the party. I called you
Kevin, but I knew you were Kyle.

1419
01:17:33,251 --> 01:17:37,415
And I knew you were in the
music school.

1420
01:17:40,459 --> 01:17:41,892
Why do you do that shit?

1421
01:17:43,228 --> 01:17:45,560
I don't know. I guess it's
kinda fucked up.

1422
01:17:47,699 --> 01:17:48,757
Damn straight.

1423
01:17:49,768 --> 01:17:50,826
Why stop at one?

1424
01:17:55,006 --> 01:17:57,236
I do know why I do it, it
sounds stupid.

1425
01:17:58,777 --> 01:17:59,471
Why?

1426
01:18:04,416 --> 01:18:05,610
To make you want me.

1427
01:18:07,252 --> 01:18:08,219
That is stupid.

1428
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:09,452
it's true.

1429
01:18:10,722 --> 01:18:12,246
isn't it painfully obvious?

1430
01:18:14,493 --> 01:18:21,023
What, by the way you look
paying attention?

1431
01:18:23,835 --> 01:18:26,565
Or by the way you always
and not me?

1432
01:18:27,973 --> 01:18:33,309
Oh come on. You're too good
You know how the system works.

1433
01:18:33,979 --> 01:18:35,173
The system sucks.

1434
01:18:48,426 --> 01:18:54,956
I've always loved your music.
I went to your recital.

1435
01:18:57,969 --> 01:18:59,436
They told me someone came.

1436
01:19:04,442 --> 01:19:06,171
Please tell me you like to
kiss.

1437
01:19:07,846 --> 01:19:08,608
Love it.

1438
01:19:12,717 --> 01:19:21,022
Okay, so I know I might just
whatever it is, I'll take it.

1439
01:19:23,128 --> 01:19:24,322
You are so weird.

1440
01:19:39,611 --> 01:19:42,045
Does that turn you on as
much as it does me?

1441
01:19:43,815 --> 01:19:44,110
Huh?

1442
01:19:45,050 --> 01:19:46,108
I thought so.

1443
01:22:56,007 --> 01:22:57,599
I think everybody's gone now.
