1
00:00:20,767 --> 00:00:23,640
<i>All right, we're at scene B.
We're in the living room.</i>

2
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:25,711
<i>Settle, please.</i>

3
00:00:25,712 --> 00:00:27,216
<i>Ready, Ed?</i>

4
00:00:27,217 --> 00:00:29,221
<i>And action.</i>

5
00:00:29,222 --> 00:00:31,426
<i>Don't argue with me, Sharon.
I don't want to hear it.</i>

6
00:00:31,427 --> 00:00:32,829
<i>I know what I saw.</i>

7
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,668
<i>That girl is
out of control.</i>

8
00:00:34,669 --> 00:00:36,906
I came in here, I found
my sweet darling daughter

9
00:00:36,907 --> 00:00:40,515
making out on the couch with
that Martin kid. It was horrific.

10
00:00:40,516 --> 00:00:44,191
I haven't seen that much tongue
since your Uncle Morty's last seder.

11
00:00:44,192 --> 00:00:46,463
<i>Excuse me, Ed,
but I seem to recall</i>

12
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:49,003
<i>you throwing that tongue around
pretty good when we were dating.</i>

13
00:00:49,004 --> 00:00:51,175
<i>I have no memory of that.
When we were first together,</i>

14
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,913
<i>I was always
the perfect gentleman.</i>

15
00:00:52,914 --> 00:00:55,018
<i>It wasn't about sex.
It was about romance.</i>

16
00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:56,722
<i>Yeah, I remember
the romance.</i>

17
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,528
<i>Our first kiss was in a dark alley
behind a bad Mexican restaurant.</i>

18
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:01,433
<i>That was very romantic--</i>

19
00:01:01,434 --> 00:01:03,505
<i>the cool night air,
the starry sky.</i>

20
00:01:03,506 --> 00:01:04,942
<i>The snow-covered
dumpster.</i>

21
00:01:04,943 --> 00:01:06,112
<i>There was no dumpster.</i>

22
00:01:06,113 --> 00:01:08,017
<i>Ed, we were standing
right next to it.</i>

23
00:01:08,018 --> 00:01:09,821
<i>I do not remember
a dumpster.</i>

24
00:01:09,822 --> 00:01:13,463
<i>That would explain why I get so
excited whenever we have chimichangas.</i>

25
00:01:13,464 --> 00:01:15,368
Ah.

26
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:16,905
<i>Okay, guys, moving on.</i>

27
00:01:16,906 --> 00:01:19,512
<i>Scene E-- we're over here
at airport security.</i>

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,243
- Taylor?
- Shit.

29
00:01:32,244 --> 00:01:34,783
- Hey.  Hey.
- You ran right out of there.

30
00:01:34,784 --> 00:01:36,788
Yeah, I wasn't running.
I was walking.

31
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:38,425
Pretty good for
Wednesday.

32
00:01:38,426 --> 00:01:40,163
Yeah.
Yeah, I thought so.

33
00:01:40,164 --> 00:01:41,800
- Really?
- Nah.

34
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,672
Of course not.
It was shit.  We'll fix it.

35
00:01:43,673 --> 00:01:45,075
- Where are you going?
- Dentist.

36
00:01:45,076 --> 00:01:47,080
- Ooh!  Ouch.
- Yeah.

37
00:01:47,081 --> 00:01:47,826
That's gonna hurt.

38
00:01:47,827 --> 00:01:50,020
Listen, Taylor, I just want
to give you the head's up.

39
00:01:50,021 --> 00:01:52,594
Ed's unhappy.
He's been calling Carrie.

40
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:54,264
He says you're
ignoring him.

41
00:01:54,265 --> 00:01:57,472
Jesus Christ, I'm in there five
times a day holding his hand,

42
00:01:57,473 --> 00:02:00,045
listening to all his
lame-ass joke pitches,

43
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:02,852
all that crap about solar
energy for the umpteenth time.

44
00:02:02,853 --> 00:02:05,894
Yeah, well, he's the star of your
show so you can't just ignore him.

45
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:08,166
And he's godfather to one
of Carrie's kids, you know.

46
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:11,106
Like I give a shit.
Listen, you remind Begley

47
00:02:11,107 --> 00:02:13,813
that before I came on board,
no one was watching this show.

48
00:02:13,814 --> 00:02:16,419
Last time I looked, we're
like 26th in the ratings.

49
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,193
Oh, when was that? 'Cause last
week you were in the low 50s.

50
00:02:19,194 --> 00:02:21,632
Think I care
about the ratings?

51
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:23,871
Listen, can we talk
about this some other time?

52
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,742
Taylor, I don't want
to be a dick.

53
00:02:25,743 --> 00:02:29,151
No, it's okay.
You can't help yourself.

54
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:31,624
Look.

55
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,228
You need this job.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,639
<i>After your spectacular
flameout a couple of seasons ago,</i>

57
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,178
<i>people weren't exactly
lined up to hire you.</i>

58
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:42,851
Now, if this was maybe my
last chance at the business,

59
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:46,661
I think that I'd be kissing my
star's ass as often as was necessary.

60
00:02:46,662 --> 00:02:48,766
Yeah.

61
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:50,504
Enjoy the dentist.

62
00:03:09,953 --> 00:03:11,957
<i>What are you doing?</i>

63
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,628
<i>Hit him off the rail!</i>

64
00:03:15,601 --> 00:03:17,805
Come on!

65
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:20,245
Come on, come on!
Hit him.

66
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:44,370
<i>- Hey, Honey.
- Hi, you.</i>

67
00:03:44,371 --> 00:03:46,510
<i>How's it going?
How was your run-through?</i>

68
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:49,383
Well, if they ever put together a
tribunal for crimes against comedy,

69
00:03:49,384 --> 00:03:50,687
I'm fucked.

70
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,025
<i>- What's up?
- Nothing.</i>

71
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:55,164
Just paying some bills.
Where are you?

72
00:03:55,165 --> 00:03:57,441
<i>- Work.
- I just called the office.</i>

73
00:03:57,442 --> 00:03:58,606
They said you were gone.

74
00:03:58,607 --> 00:04:00,444
Ah, well, I'm at
the network.

75
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:02,717
Actually, I'm about to
head into a meeting.

76
00:04:02,718 --> 00:04:04,989
- Hey, I'm in here.

77
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,462
<i>- Are you using the phone?
- I'm using a phone.</i>

78
00:04:07,463 --> 00:04:09,332
Do you mind?

79
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,106
Open that door!
I gotta make a phone call.

80
00:04:12,107 --> 00:04:13,944
<i>- Hon-- honey?</i>

81
00:04:13,945 --> 00:04:15,515
<i>- Who was that?
- Honey, I'm gonna--</i>

82
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:17,620
I'm gonna actually--
I'm gonna call you back, okay?

83
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:18,956
<i>Open the door!
I gotta make a phone call!</i>

84
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:19,692
I'll call you right back.

85
00:04:23,502 --> 00:04:25,439
<i>- Hello?
- Sorry, honey.</i>

86
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,012
<i>- Hi.  So you're at the network?
- Yup.</i>

87
00:04:28,013 --> 00:04:30,184
Can you-- can you not
sweep right now?

88
00:04:30,185 --> 00:04:32,056
Yes, I am.
What's up?

89
00:04:32,057 --> 00:04:34,261
My sister called. She wants
us to go out there later.

90
00:04:34,262 --> 00:04:35,832
Some kind of
family emergency.

91
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,904
Well, so we have to drive
all the way out to the desert?

92
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:40,510
She says she needs to
talk to me in person.

93
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:42,782
Do you think you can
be home by 5:00, 5:30?

94
00:04:44,755 --> 00:04:46,324
Hang-- hang on
a second.

95
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:48,329
Sir, can you please?
Please?

96
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,604
Honey, I'm-- I'm really up
to my ass here, you know?

97
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:54,644
I've got this meeting to do.
I have a rewrite.

98
00:04:55,982 --> 00:04:58,087
Are you in a bathroom?

99
00:04:58,088 --> 00:05:01,729
Yes. Yes, they do have bathrooms
at the network, you know.

100
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,934
Not all the shit
ends up on the schedule.

101
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:05,773
<i>Hello?</i>

102
00:05:07,077 --> 00:05:08,613
<i>Hello?</i>

103
00:05:08,614 --> 00:05:10,216
Are you at the track?

104
00:05:10,217 --> 00:05:12,656
Lorraine.
Lorraine, I am not gambling.

105
00:05:12,657 --> 00:05:15,329
I haven't made a bet in weeks,
possibly a month.

106
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,168
<i>Okay.</i>

107
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:19,373
I'm doing
what you wanted.

108
00:05:19,374 --> 00:05:21,779
I'm not gambling.
I'm seeing that guy.

109
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,256
- I'm sorry.

110
00:05:22,257 --> 00:05:23,884
<i>- I mean, come on./i>
Give me a break.</i>

111
00:05:23,885 --> 00:05:26,290
I know, I'm sorry.

112
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,295
Do you think you can
be home by 5:00?

113
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:30,100
5:30.  I'll try.

114
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:32,305
<i>- I love you.
- I love you too.</i>

115
00:05:34,645 --> 00:05:36,850
Uh, you're breaking up,
sweetheart.

116
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:39,456
I'll check in with
you later, all right?

117
00:05:39,457 --> 00:05:41,293
Just sweep.

118
00:05:44,202 --> 00:05:47,777
Go, number one! Number
three, die! One, go!

119
00:05:47,778 --> 00:05:51,620
Go, one! Oh, number one!
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck you--

120
00:05:51,621 --> 00:05:54,393
<i>Taylor, why do you
bet on the horses?</i>

121
00:05:54,394 --> 00:05:57,635
<i>I don't know.
I guess I like the challenge of it.</i>

122
00:05:57,636 --> 00:06:01,277
<i>Go to the track,
race form under your arm,</i>

123
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,418
<i>it's nine races and
thousands of possibilities.</i>

124
00:06:05,989 --> 00:06:08,260
<i>I like the whole experience,
really.</i>

125
00:06:09,431 --> 00:06:11,502
<i>The horses,
the puzzle of it,</i>

126
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:13,407
<i>the people.</i>

127
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:15,345
<i>I just love it.
I really do.</i>

128
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,087
When was the last time
you went to the track?

129
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:21,059
It's been a while.

130
00:06:22,631 --> 00:06:24,635
Do you think you're
ready to give it up?

131
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:26,172
Totally?

132
00:06:26,173 --> 00:06:29,179
Total abstinence is the only
effective course of treatment

133
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,251
with horse-race gamblers.

134
00:06:31,252 --> 00:06:34,058
Look-- look,
I used to drink.

135
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:36,264
I used to do drugs.
I stopped.

136
00:06:36,265 --> 00:06:39,605
I've been clean
for almost two years.

137
00:06:39,606 --> 00:06:42,914
My work was--
I had to stop.

138
00:06:42,915 --> 00:06:45,520
But the track?

139
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:48,126
Who am I hurting?
I earn enough money.

140
00:06:48,127 --> 00:06:49,830
You don't think
it's destructive?

141
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:51,969
I've already quit
enough stuff.

142
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,241
I don't want to
give up everything.

143
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,953
Then why are you here?

144
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,066
My wife thinks I need
to talk to somebody.

145
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,809
What's the point
of talking

146
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,147
if you have no intention
of quitting?

147
00:07:14,325 --> 00:07:16,096
<i>Taylor?</i>

148
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:21,208
Is that clock right?
Because I...

149
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:24,684
Think our 50 minutes
are up.

150
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:37,716
<i>- Hit him, hit him, hit him!</i>

151
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:40,924
Hit him! Oh, God,
no no no.

152
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:44,333
Oh, God.
Shit.

153
00:07:45,971 --> 00:07:48,776
What's the matter?
I'm only 10 minutes late.

154
00:07:48,777 --> 00:07:51,550
That's not so bad
considering the day I had.

155
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,591
Dr. Chase says hello,
by the way.

156
00:07:54,592 --> 00:07:57,264
Hello, Dr. Chase.

157
00:07:57,265 --> 00:07:59,370
<i>Is it something I did?</i>

158
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:04,048
I just--

159
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:07,790
I went to that new organic
market next to the coffee place.

160
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,060
<i>Okay.</i>

161
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:12,101
And as I was leaving,
I bumped into Nancy Karos.

162
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:13,973
And we're talking,

163
00:08:13,974 --> 00:08:15,977
and she asked me
what you were working on

164
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:18,718
and I told her and then she
said-- this is unbelievable,

165
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:21,123
she said, "You're kidding me.
That show sucks."

166
00:08:21,124 --> 00:08:23,863
<i>- Mm-hmm, well...
- Well, I went off on her</i>

167
00:08:23,864 --> 00:08:26,905
and I was yelling and
I think I used the C word.

168
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,475
<i>- Holy shit.
- Yeah.</i>

169
00:08:28,476 --> 00:08:31,115
And then she, like,
put her hand on my shoulder

170
00:08:31,116 --> 00:08:33,888
and I pushed her
and she fell...

171
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:36,963
into some gourds--
into a gourd display.

172
00:08:36,964 --> 00:08:40,405
The C word?  Wow.

173
00:08:40,406 --> 00:08:42,410
I'm guessing we
won't be invited

174
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:44,415
to their Fourth of
July thing this year.

175
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,252
No.  I was shaking
the whole way home.

176
00:08:46,253 --> 00:08:49,527
Honey-- honey, you're very
loyal and I love you for it.

177
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:52,735
But the show does suck.

178
00:08:52,736 --> 00:08:54,974
But you're
making it better.

179
00:08:57,047 --> 00:08:59,084
Nobody messes
with my man.

180
00:09:00,321 --> 00:09:02,259
I'll wait for you
downstairs.

181
00:09:14,523 --> 00:09:16,194
Damn it!

182
00:09:16,195 --> 00:09:18,399
I'll get you,
you little prick!

183
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,604
God! Squirrels.

184
00:09:20,605 --> 00:09:22,642
Goddamn useless...

185
00:09:22,643 --> 00:09:26,184
they bury shit all over the place.
They tear up my yard.

186
00:09:26,185 --> 00:09:27,956
Assholes!

187
00:09:27,957 --> 00:09:30,194
Ha!
Dad said "asshole."

188
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,266
I don't know what
it's like where you are,

189
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:34,739
but around here
it's a serious problem.

190
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,477
Well, what can
you do?

191
00:09:36,478 --> 00:09:41,021
I can blow their fuckin' little
furry heads off, is what I can do.

192
00:09:41,022 --> 00:09:43,261
Larry, you might want
to keep your voice down.

193
00:09:43,262 --> 00:09:45,199
I think the boys
can hear you.

194
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,903
Do you have kids?

195
00:09:46,904 --> 00:09:50,813
Then don't tell me
how to behave around mine.

196
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,133
Let's go.

197
00:09:59,134 --> 00:10:01,138
Hey, you want
another beer?

198
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:03,611
- No. No, this is--
- Oh, lemonade.

199
00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:04,848
- Yeah.
- Right.

200
00:10:04,849 --> 00:10:06,451
Sorry.

201
00:10:06,452 --> 00:10:08,055
God, must be tough.

202
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:10,963
- Not drinking.
- It's been about two years.

203
00:10:10,964 --> 00:10:12,233
Dad Dad Dad!

204
00:10:12,234 --> 00:10:13,803
Can we shoot?

205
00:10:13,804 --> 00:10:15,540
Yeah. Yeah.

206
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,980
Just, you know,
be careful.

207
00:10:17,981 --> 00:10:22,023
And if you aim at
each other, lower body only.

208
00:10:22,024 --> 00:10:24,463
- No faces.
- Okay!

209
00:10:27,404 --> 00:10:29,174
You can't catch me!

210
00:10:29,175 --> 00:10:31,179
<i>- How's your show going?
- Great.</i>

211
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,650
<i>I don't watch it.</i>

212
00:10:32,651 --> 00:10:34,888
Uh, I would, but...

213
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:38,698
I don't need my boys exposed to
all that sex and foul language.

214
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:40,168
Yeah, I get that.

215
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:42,875
Uh, they're not killing
each other, are they?

216
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,815
You can't kill anybody
with an air pistol.

217
00:10:45,816 --> 00:10:49,324
Well, you know, maybe
if you got up real close

218
00:10:49,325 --> 00:10:51,830
and pumped one right
in the eye.

219
00:10:51,831 --> 00:10:53,935
That's the trouble
with you liberals.

220
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:56,843
Hey, you get all nervous
around guns.

221
00:10:56,844 --> 00:10:59,048
Just guns in the hands
of third graders.

222
00:11:01,054 --> 00:11:03,058
Boys, damn it!

223
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:05,665
No, that is coming
out of your allowance!

224
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,272
He complains about
the foul language in the show.

225
00:11:08,273 --> 00:11:10,377
Meanwhile, he's back there
in front of his kids

226
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,949
yelling, "Fuck the squirrels"
at the top of his lungs.

227
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,792
The boys are running around doing the
first 20 minutes of "Saving Private Ryan."

228
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:18,897
Well, people take different
approaches to parenting.

229
00:11:18,898 --> 00:11:20,735
Yeah, well, I just don't
think it's right

230
00:11:20,736 --> 00:11:22,807
to raise children whose
inner sense of security

231
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:24,946
depends on whether or not
they have a full clip handy.

232
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:26,951
They're having trouble
with Amanda.

233
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,258
- That's the big emergency?

234
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:30,192
- She's in Las Vegas
with some boyfriend.

235
00:11:30,193 --> 00:11:31,629
- Well, how old is she?
- 20.

236
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,069
- That seems all right.
- She's working as a prostitute.

237
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,875
What?
She's working as a what?

238
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:39,047
She's working as
a prostitute.

239
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:40,651
- Holy shit!
- Shh!

240
00:11:40,652 --> 00:11:43,525
Are you kidding? She's
a prostitute? A hooker?

241
00:11:43,526 --> 00:11:45,998
Yes. Keep your voice down.
Get in the car.

242
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:48,404
Wait a minute, my 20-year-old
niece is working as a hooker?

243
00:11:48,405 --> 00:11:49,741
<i>Get in the car!</i>

244
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,545
Amanda called a couple
of months ago

245
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:53,784
all excited about
this job she got dancing.

246
00:11:53,785 --> 00:11:55,454
- In a show?
- No, some club.

247
00:11:55,455 --> 00:11:58,128
Ah, well, I could have
told you right there.

248
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:00,768
You see, in Vegas, dancing is
a euphemism for stripping.

249
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:03,307
And stripping is
a euphemism for hooking.

250
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:05,346
Okay.

251
00:12:05,347 --> 00:12:07,685
So Amanda had this friend,
Lauren.

252
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,456
And she went out
to Las Vegas

253
00:12:09,457 --> 00:12:11,327
and stayed with Amanda
for a few days.

254
00:12:11,328 --> 00:12:13,666
And she was so worried,
she called Karen.

255
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:16,674
And she told her that she
thinks Amanda might be on drugs.

256
00:12:16,675 --> 00:12:19,448
And she told her that Amanda
was being a hooker?

257
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:21,118
How does she know?

258
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,123
Amanda just came out
and said it.

259
00:12:23,124 --> 00:12:25,329
I guess she has a lot
of money and a new house.

260
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,334
And, Taylor, you can't tell
anybody about this

261
00:12:27,335 --> 00:12:29,171
because Karen doesn't
want it spread around.

262
00:12:29,172 --> 00:12:31,009
I'm sure they're probably
saving it for

263
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,549
that idiotic Christmas
letter they write every year.

264
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,526
"Donny's in third grade. Larry,
Jr. Just got his gun permit

265
00:12:37,527 --> 00:12:41,001
and Amanda's in Vegas with some
strange guy's baby batter in her hair."

266
00:12:41,002 --> 00:12:42,839
- Uh, that's--
- Don't do that. I'm driving.

267
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,576
- That's not funny.
- Don't hit when I'm driving.

268
00:12:44,577 --> 00:12:47,584
Listen, Karen wants to get
Amanda into rehab

269
00:12:47,585 --> 00:12:49,756
and there's this place
in Malibu--

270
00:12:49,757 --> 00:12:52,062
Clark-- Clark Baron
Chrysalis Center.

271
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,301
- I've heard of it.
- It's in "people" every other week.

272
00:12:54,302 --> 00:12:56,573
They mostly deal
with young people.

273
00:12:56,574 --> 00:13:00,015
It's a six-week program and
I said we would pay for it.

274
00:13:00,016 --> 00:13:03,223
- How much?
- $15,000.

275
00:13:03,224 --> 00:13:04,793
Okay.

276
00:13:04,794 --> 00:13:06,631
How do they intend
to get her there?

277
00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:08,770
They're hoping she's
gonna want to go.

278
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:11,175
Oh, yeah, 'cause everybody
wants to go to rehab.

279
00:13:11,176 --> 00:13:13,782
Rehab's about the happiest
place on earth

280
00:13:13,783 --> 00:13:15,420
right-- right behind
Disneyland.

281
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:18,427
You know, will you just please stop it?
Because you're not helping.

282
00:13:18,428 --> 00:13:21,100
I need a cigarette.

283
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:24,075
I don't think there--
I don't thing there are any in there.

284
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,228
What are these?

285
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:35,202
- Oh, those. Those are-- they're old.
- Today's the 14th.

286
00:13:35,203 --> 00:13:37,274
- They're from months ago.
- These are from today.

287
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,512
Uh, I'm not sure.

288
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:48,100
Jesus, Taylor. I asked
you, were you at the track.

289
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:50,172
Well, when you asked,
I wasn't.

290
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,522
When did you go? Before or
after you session with Dr. Chase?

291
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:02,035
Can you turn the car around?

292
00:14:02,036 --> 00:14:03,772
It's just a few bets.

293
00:14:03,773 --> 00:14:06,546
It's no more
than $200 tops.

294
00:14:09,588 --> 00:14:11,526
Turn the car around.

295
00:14:12,595 --> 00:14:14,734
All right,
I made a mistake.

296
00:14:14,735 --> 00:14:16,772
But I've been doing
much better.

297
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,011
It was only a matter of time
until I slipped up, right?

298
00:14:19,012 --> 00:14:20,714
- You lied to me.
- Lorraine.

299
00:14:20,715 --> 00:14:23,254
Lorraine, don't do this.
Don't do this-- I don't see the problem.

300
00:14:23,255 --> 00:14:25,259
Yeah, I know you don't.
There's this thing,

301
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,331
Taylor, in a marriage
called "trust."

302
00:14:27,332 --> 00:14:29,804
You and I, after so many years
of your lies and your bullshit,

303
00:14:29,805 --> 00:14:31,374
we don't have a lot
of it left.

304
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:34,081
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, because you got caught.

305
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,421
'Cause you're in trouble.
Just go home.

306
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:37,131
- Lorraine.

307
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:40,029
- Go home and figure
out what you really want.

308
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,775
Hey. Hey, honey,
thanks for picking up.

309
00:15:40,313 --> 00:15:43,720
Well, what I want is to say
that I'm an asshole.

310
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:45,825
But I'm gonna
make it up to you.

311
00:15:45,826 --> 00:15:47,830
And I'm gonna prove to you
once and for all

312
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:50,738
that I can control
the gambling.

313
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:53,010
<i>- I'm going to Vegas--</i>

314
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:55,315
Hello? Hello?

315
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:57,118
- Let me finish.
I'm going to Vegas and--

316
00:15:59,528 --> 00:16:01,465
Please let me finish.

317
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:04,605
I'm leaving first thing in the
morning. I'm going to find Amanda

318
00:16:04,606 --> 00:16:06,744
and I'm gonna take her
to rehab.

319
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:10,052
And while I'm in Las Vegas,
I'm not gonna gamble one cent.

320
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,724
<i>- Damn it!</i>

321
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:13,394
God damn it.

322
00:16:13,395 --> 00:16:15,633
Okay, listen
and don't hang up.

323
00:16:15,634 --> 00:16:18,206
I made a mistake, yes.

324
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:20,545
But I'm gonna do
this thing for Amanda

325
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:24,221
because-- because you are
everything to me.

326
00:16:24,222 --> 00:16:28,599
You-- you're my whole life
and I love you.

327
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,940
And-- and if I lose you,
I've--

328
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:34,513
I've got nothing.
Okay?

329
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,359
Why are you answering
her phone, Larry?

330
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:43,669
Just tell her
to call me.

331
00:17:07,095 --> 00:17:09,600
<i># there's everywhere else #</i>

332
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:12,273
<i># and then there's Vegas #</i>

333
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:18,054
<i># anywhere else just don't
fit the bill #</i>

334
00:17:20,427 --> 00:17:22,633

00:17:22,634 --> 00:17:25,540

<i># you feel like

337
00:17:29,016 --> 00:17:30,786

353
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,648
This isn't your usual suite,
Mr. Mendon.

354
00:18:22,649 --> 00:18:24,152
No problem.
It's fine.

355
00:18:24,153 --> 00:18:25,655
You can just
put that anywhere.

356
00:18:25,656 --> 00:18:27,927
Now you've got the new plasma
screens in every room.

357
00:18:27,928 --> 00:18:30,033
And there's a little one
in the bathroom.

358
00:18:30,034 --> 00:18:31,971
Great.  It's perfect.
You can drop that anywhere.

359
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,547
You haven't been here
in a while, huh?

360
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,050
I've been busy
with the show.

361
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:39,624
- Which one is it again?
- "Those MacAllisters."

362
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,731
Oh, yeah.
That show's great.

363
00:18:42,732 --> 00:18:45,772
You get a bigger tip if you
tell me what you really think.

364
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:48,445
Oh, no.

365
00:18:48,446 --> 00:18:50,049
No, I like it.
It's good...

366
00:18:52,022 --> 00:18:54,627
If you like crap.

367
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,306
'Cause it's a total
piece of shit.

368
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:01,411
Probably the biggest piece
of shit in the history of--

369
00:19:01,412 --> 00:19:04,852
Okay okay, you got greedy.
You had the hundred but you blew it.

370
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:06,857
Kidding.

371
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:09,063
Hey, well, thanks,
Mr. Mendon.

372
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,001
<i>- And welcome back.
- Knock knock.</i>

373
00:19:11,002 --> 00:19:13,014
- If there's anything else
you want me to do...

374
00:19:13,015 --> 00:19:13,307
- Thanks.

375
00:19:13,308 --> 00:19:14,384
I heard you were here.

376
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:16,047
I came right up with extra pillows.

377
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:17,718
Oh, you're too good
to me, Sally.

378
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:19,689
- Sharon.
- Oh, I remember.

379
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,728
Did I leave you
a good tip last time?

380
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:22,672
<i>- I think so.</i>

381
00:19:22,673 --> 00:19:24,936
- Well, if you're not
sure, it wasn't big enough.

382
00:19:24,937 --> 00:19:26,807
I'm gonna leave you
a very nice tip this visit.

383
00:19:26,808 --> 00:19:29,246
Oh, I don't expect anything,
Mr. Mendon.

384
00:19:29,247 --> 00:19:32,153
It's gonna be big,
so get ready.  I feel lucky.

385
00:19:33,659 --> 00:19:36,531
I would like $15,000
in cash

386
00:19:36,532 --> 00:19:41,076
and you can hold the rest.
Hopefully I won't need it.

387
00:19:41,077 --> 00:19:43,883
Ooh, gosh,
I sure hope not.

388
00:19:43,884 --> 00:19:47,658
I'm gonna need my supervisor's
approval on this, Mr. Mendon.

389
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:51,101
Why? Why?  I'm a regular--
I'm a regular player here.

390
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:53,874
We need approval on
anything over $10,000

391
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,280
and this is way
over that amount.

392
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:58,385
Marty?

393
00:20:00,224 --> 00:20:03,230
He's busy right now.
Can you wait two seconds?

394
00:20:07,776 --> 00:20:09,613
Is Michael Henry here?

395
00:20:09,614 --> 00:20:10,248
Taylor, can I
tell you something?

396
00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:11,117
You know these people?

397
00:20:11,118 --> 00:20:12,988
They're all about
the money.

398
00:20:12,989 --> 00:20:15,160
They don't see
beyond that.

399
00:20:15,161 --> 00:20:17,733
They don't care
about this.

400
00:20:17,734 --> 00:20:19,471
What is that?

401
00:20:19,472 --> 00:20:21,008
The relationship.

402
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:22,745
This relationship
right here.

403
00:20:22,746 --> 00:20:23,948
Oh.

404
00:20:23,949 --> 00:20:26,655
This relationship right here,
this is real.

405
00:20:26,656 --> 00:20:29,128
The rest of it,
as far as I'm concerned--

406
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:30,598
bullshit.

407
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,336
Michael, what is
the issue?

408
00:20:32,337 --> 00:20:35,678
Um, we had that situation
last time you were here--

409
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,685
I hesitate to even
call it a situation--

410
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:40,523
that minor non-event.

411
00:20:40,524 --> 00:20:42,027
I don't remember that.

412
00:20:42,028 --> 00:20:43,530
The check that bounced.

413
00:20:43,531 --> 00:20:45,769
That was my business
manager's fault.

414
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,340
I told you that.
I explained that.

415
00:20:47,341 --> 00:20:49,880
Hey hey, you're preaching
to the choir.

416
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,052
You're the preacher,
I'm up in the loft.

417
00:20:52,053 --> 00:20:53,822
I got the music,
I'm singing.

418
00:20:53,823 --> 00:20:56,429
And I'm also listening
and I'm understanding.

419
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,267
And I'm in complete
agreement.

420
00:20:58,268 --> 00:21:00,072
- Hey, Michael.
- Hey, look at you!

421
00:21:00,073 --> 00:21:03,012
Look how hot you are!
I can feel the heat way over here!

422
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:06,721
You bastard!  My eyebrows are
almost completely burned off.

423
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:09,394
That guy's a complete prick.

424
00:21:09,395 --> 00:21:12,569
No, he and I--
we don't have this.

425
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:16,479
This is what I have
with him.

426
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,284
Well, that looks
like what we have.

427
00:21:18,285 --> 00:21:20,188
What? God, no no.
Look at this.

428
00:21:20,189 --> 00:21:22,995
This only goes one way.
Look, it's me giving.  Giving.

429
00:21:22,996 --> 00:21:24,732
It looks the same to me.

430
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:27,573
No no, we--
we have this.

431
00:21:27,574 --> 00:21:29,745
- See, there it is, Daddy.
- 'Kay.

432
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,750
I still don't understand.
Listen,

433
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:34,557
Do you guys not want my action
here? Is that what it is?

434
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:35,693
No no, it's not that.  No.

435
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,231
'Cause just tell me,
Michael.

436
00:21:37,232 --> 00:21:40,104
Because if that's true, I'll
go across the street right now.

437
00:21:40,105 --> 00:21:43,078
You know how much money I lose.
They'd be thrilled to have me.

438
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:45,116
Okay, now you're hurting me.

439
00:21:46,922 --> 00:21:49,427
I'll handle these pricks.
You're good to go.

440
00:21:49,428 --> 00:21:52,334
Go on, go get you some money
and start having some fun.

441
00:21:52,335 --> 00:21:53,938
<i>As they come into
the stretch,</i>

442
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:56,411
<i>Dugal on the inside,
Cootie Booton on the outside.</i>

443
00:21:56,412 --> 00:21:58,116
<i>Dugal finding more
of the rail</i>

444
00:21:58,117 --> 00:21:59,853
<i>but here comes
Cootie Booton.</i>

445
00:21:59,854 --> 00:22:01,858
<i>Cootie Booton's finding
another gear.</i>

446
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:04,364
<i>Nose to nose with Dugal.
Here comes the wire.</i>

447
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:05,719
<i>Cootie Booton in front.</i>

448
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,839
<i>A desperate last lunge
from Dugal.</i>

449
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,343
<i>Dugal wins by a nose!</i>

450
00:22:09,344 --> 00:22:11,348
<i>Cootie Booton
an unlucky second.</i>

451
00:22:11,349 --> 00:22:13,620
<i>And a long way back

452
00:22:13,621 --> 00:22:16,461

<i>Come on, three.

00:22:19,737 --> 00:22:22,175
Come on, three.
Go, three.

455
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:24,815
Go, three.  Go, three.
Go, three!

456
00:22:24,816 --> 00:22:27,421
No, six-- three.
No six-- three.

457
00:22:27,422 --> 00:22:29,627
Three three three!
Where's the wire-- the wire?

458
00:22:29,628 --> 00:22:32,133
- Where is the wire?

459
00:22:32,134 --> 00:22:33,703
- Three.
- That's the winner.

460

the back stretch</i>

461
00:22:39,853 --> 00:22:41,723

00:22:52,986 --> 00:22:55,925
- Miss? - What can I get you?

465
00:22:55,926 --> 00:22:57,997
You have--

466
00:22:57,998 --> 00:23:00,837
- Do you have Jameson's?
- Yeah.

467
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:03,243
I'll take a diet coke.

468
00:23:03,244 --> 00:23:04,680
And the Jameson's?

469
00:23:04,681 --> 00:23:07,420
No, just the coke.
Uh, diet.

470
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:09,860
You have lettuce
on you.

471
00:23:09,861 --> 00:23:11,530
Oh, it's this shirt.

472
00:23:11,531 --> 00:23:14,037
It came that way.

473
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:16,275

<i>- I'm home.
- Good.</i>

482
00:24:01,055 --> 00:24:03,559
There were quite a few
calls from work today.

483
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,932
I guess you didn't tell anyone
you were running off.

484
00:24:05,933 --> 00:24:08,304
They camera-blocked all day.
They didn't need me.

485
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:10,209
If they call again,
tell them I'll be back

486
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,214
by show time
tomorrow night.

487
00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:14,988
Or I'll call them. Yeah,
I'll be back. Don't worry.

<i>How much

489
00:24:16,827 --> 00:24:19,265
Honey-- honey, this is
not about gambling.

490
00:24:19,266 --> 00:24:20,702
I told you.

491
00:24:20,703 --> 00:24:23,041
Even if I wanted to gamble,
where would I get the money?

492
00:24:23,042 --> 00:24:25,815
I don't have an ATM card.
I don't have my checkbook.

Do you know where

496
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,876
The Aztec? What, you mean
like the Indians?

497
00:24:39,817 --> 00:24:42,389
<i>I spoke to Lauren a little

00:25:11,195 --> 00:25:14,535
You know, the Aztecs
performed human sacrifices.

508
00:25:14,536 --> 00:25:17,242
That's one of the reasons
they were wiped out by Cortez

509
00:25:17,243 --> 00:25:19,415
- and the conquistadors.
- I wouldn't know.

510
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:21,954
We don't get a lot
of 'em in here.

511
00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:23,458
Right.

512
00:25:23,459 --> 00:25:27,067
So-- so listen,
I'm in town by myself.

513
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:28,537
Okay.

514
00:25:28,538 --> 00:25:32,212
And, you know how it is.
It gets-- gets a little lonely at night.

515
00:25:32,213 --> 00:25:33,549
Sure.

516
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,655
So I was hoping to
find some company.

517
00:25:35,656 --> 00:25:37,793
- Company?
- Right.

518
00:25:37,794 --> 00:25:39,631
You're asking me
about some company?

519
00:25:39,632 --> 00:25:42,405
Right.

520
00:25:42,406 --> 00:25:44,544
I get off at 2:00.

521
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:46,549
I don't kiss, I don't call you
"sweetheart" or "darling,"

522
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,185
And I don't take it
in the ass.

523
00:25:48,186 --> 00:25:49,455
Oh now, hold on.

524
00:25:49,456 --> 00:25:50,592
Cash only.

525
00:25:50,593 --> 00:25:52,429
No, I'm looking
for a girl.

526
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,067
I don't do three-ways.

527
00:25:54,068 --> 00:25:55,939
No, just a girl.

528
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,509
I'm looking for
just a girl.

529
00:25:59,213 --> 00:26:00,650
Oh.

530
00:26:00,651 --> 00:26:02,321
Check over
by the elevators.

531
00:26:02,322 --> 00:26:04,025
Thanks.

532
00:26:05,496 --> 00:26:07,534
I'm super-hung
if it makes any difference.

533
00:26:07,535 --> 00:26:09,004
It doesn't.

534
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,517
Oh, fine.
You and your friend,

535
00:26:14,518 --> 00:26:16,623
you're not gonna
leave me alone, are you?

536
00:26:16,624 --> 00:26:17,105
<i>- No?</i>

537
00:26:17,106 --> 00:26:18,628
<i>We appreciate it, though.</i>

538
00:26:18,629 --> 00:26:20,699
<i>- Have fun.
- You guys.</i>

539
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,006
Hey, stud, how--

540
00:26:23,007 --> 00:26:26,347
Oh my God.
Oh, my gosh!

541
00:26:26,348 --> 00:26:28,151
- Hi, stranger.
- Uncle Taylor!

542
00:26:28,152 --> 00:26:29,488
What are you doing here?

543
00:26:29,489 --> 00:26:30,991
Well, you know,
me and Aztecs.

544
00:26:30,992 --> 00:26:33,331
How's Aunt Lorraine?
Is she here?

545
00:26:33,332 --> 00:26:34,968
No, she's home.

546
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:39,379
This is-- well, this
is a nice surprise.

547
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,849
Yeah.

548
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,623
So do you want to go and talk
someplace? You know, catch up?

549
00:26:43,624 --> 00:26:47,499
Um, yeah, I would love that.
I just-- I really can't right now.

550
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,170
Can you take a break?

551
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:51,309
I can't.  Slow night.
Gotta make the rent.

552
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,748
Hi, sweetheart.
I love your shirt.

553
00:26:53,749 --> 00:26:55,218
Go down on me for free,
it's yours.

554
00:26:55,219 --> 00:26:58,059
Guys, guys, is that
really necessary?

555
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,896
- It's okay.

556
00:26:59,897 --> 00:27:01,434
That was rude.

557
00:27:01,435 --> 00:27:04,208
Um, listen, Uncle Taylor,
I really need you to, um...

558
00:27:04,209 --> 00:27:05,911
I know what
you're doing, Amanda.

559
00:27:05,912 --> 00:27:07,148
What?

560
00:27:07,149 --> 00:27:08,685
I know what
you're doing here.

561
00:27:08,686 --> 00:27:12,228
Yeah, I think everyone
knows what I'm doing here.

562
00:27:12,229 --> 00:27:13,664
You don't care?

563
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:16,070
Why should I care?
It's my job.

564
00:27:16,071 --> 00:27:17,675
Shit.

565
00:27:17,676 --> 00:27:19,612
This asshole.

566
00:27:22,086 --> 00:27:23,622
Hi.

567
00:27:25,361 --> 00:27:26,930
This young lady
bothering you, sir?

568
00:27:26,931 --> 00:27:28,200
No.
Thank you for asking.

569
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:29,905
I'm not talking to you,
am I, sweetheart?

570
00:27:29,906 --> 00:27:31,709
No, I'm fine.
This is my niece.

571
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,048
Oh, really?
Never heard that one before.

572
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:35,886
You a guest
at the hotel?

573
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,958
No, I'm staying
at the--

574
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:39,729
Feel free to enjoy
the casino,

575
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,767
But elevators are for
hotel guests, okay?

576
00:27:41,768 --> 00:27:43,672
- Thanks.
- Okay.

577
00:27:45,444 --> 00:27:48,250
Prick. Give him 20 bucks, he doesn't
hassle you for a couple hours.

578
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:50,288
So, can we talk?

579
00:27:50,289 --> 00:27:52,394
Listen, I really
gotta go.  Okay?

580
00:27:52,395 --> 00:27:54,833
- What time do you get off?
- Um, one more customer.

581
00:27:54,834 --> 00:27:56,303
- Can you hang?
- Sure.

582
00:27:56,304 --> 00:27:58,275
All right, I'll meet you
out front by Azi.

583
00:27:58,276 --> 00:27:58,538
- Who?

584
00:27:58,539 --> 00:27:59,979
- The big statue guy in the lobby.

585
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,449
- Great.  Okay.
- Okay?

586
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,953
Bye.

587
00:28:02,954 --> 00:28:05,526
- Howdy, you.
- Hey, gorgeous.

588
00:28:05,527 --> 00:28:07,965
<i>- What are you doing tonight?
- I'm not doing nothing.</i>

589
00:28:07,966 --> 00:28:09,536
Or nobody.

590
00:28:09,537 --> 00:28:12,710
Oh, well, we're gonna have
to change that now, won't we?

591
00:28:12,711 --> 00:28:14,749
Ooh wee!
Ah!

592
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,352
<i>So, where are you from,
cowboy?</i>

593
00:28:16,353 --> 00:28:19,327
<i>I'm from Burbank,
Californ-ay-a!</i>

594
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:22,034
<i>They got real cowboys
in Burbank.</i>

595
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:24,707
<i>Do they really?
Well, I got my boots on!</i>

596
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,684
This is a nice car.

597
00:28:28,685 --> 00:28:30,221
Thank you.
I just got it.

598
00:28:32,595 --> 00:28:34,598
Isn't that
the best smell?

599
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:37,472
It's the best smell. I mean,
it probably causes cancer,

600
00:28:37,473 --> 00:28:38,976
but all
the good stuff does.

601
00:28:38,977 --> 00:28:43,554
Yep.  Cigarettes, asbestos,
high-tension power lines.

602
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,528
Soon there'll be nothing
left to enjoy.

603
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:48,566
<i>So, where do you
want to talk?</i>

604
00:28:48,567 --> 00:28:49,969
Oh, I know a place.

605
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,974
I just have to go home
and change first.

606
00:28:51,975 --> 00:28:53,979
And you have to see
my house. Oh, my gosh,

607
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,951
my gorgeous,
fabulous house.

608
00:28:55,952 --> 00:28:58,324
I love it so much.

609
00:28:58,325 --> 00:29:01,398
Greg?  Baby?

610
00:29:01,399 --> 00:29:02,968
Hello?

611
00:29:02,969 --> 00:29:04,673
Where should
I put these?

612
00:29:04,674 --> 00:29:06,911
Oh, just over here
by the door.

613
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,783
Trying to keep
the carpet nice.

614
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:14,063
Come on in.

615
00:29:14,064 --> 00:29:15,868
Isn't it perfect?

616
00:29:15,869 --> 00:29:18,641
Everything in here
is just perfection.

617
00:29:18,642 --> 00:29:20,846
Well, except for
that lamp

618
00:29:20,847 --> 00:29:23,386
because it looks perfect,
but it's a little high

619
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:24,890
and the wall's
a little low.

620
00:29:24,891 --> 00:29:28,331
And so, 'cause the lamp
is high, it doesn't really--

621
00:29:28,332 --> 00:29:30,069
do you know what I mean?

622
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,508
Anyway, I'm gonna take it back in
the next couple weeks anyway, so--

623
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:36,351
Okay, I'm gonna go pee.
You stay here, make yourself cozy.

624
00:29:36,352 --> 00:29:37,821
Be right back.

625
00:29:42,501 --> 00:29:45,608
Don't tell me to shut up.
Why do you have to be so mean?

626
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:47,613
Who are you?

627
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:49,885
I came with Amanda.
She's in the bathroom.

628
00:29:49,886 --> 00:29:52,491
<i>Better not be a fuckin' john.</i>

629
00:29:52,492 --> 00:29:53,695
No, I'm her Uncle.

630
00:29:53,696 --> 00:29:55,065
- Hi.
- Get out.

631
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:57,705
I am going.
You are such an asshole.

632
00:29:57,706 --> 00:29:58,974
Just go.

633
00:29:58,975 --> 00:30:00,377
Call me.

634
00:30:07,162 --> 00:30:09,367
- You're the television guy?
- Guilty.

635
00:30:16,051 --> 00:30:18,589
<i>- Amanda! - Oh, hi, baby.</i>

636
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,294
<i>I'll be right out.</i>

637
00:30:20,295 --> 00:30:22,098
<i>Oh, you guys, I have
a really great idea.</i>

638
00:30:22,099 --> 00:30:23,402
<i>I'll be two seconds.</i>

639
00:30:25,441 --> 00:30:27,645
You can tell Amanda
about the girl if you want.

640
00:30:27,646 --> 00:30:28,747
It's no big deal.

641
00:30:28,748 --> 00:30:30,218
Oh, no, I'm not
planning on--

642
00:30:30,219 --> 00:30:32,357
You can if you want to.
No big secret.

643
00:30:32,358 --> 00:30:34,662
- It's none of my business.
- She knows about the other chicks.

644
00:30:34,663 --> 00:30:36,032
Is there more than one?

645
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:38,472
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Just the way it has to be.

646
00:30:38,473 --> 00:30:41,479
I don't follow that.

647
00:30:42,917 --> 00:30:45,389
Amanda's out banging all these
strange guys all the time.

648
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,194
I gotta deal with that,
you know?

649
00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:48,797
So I bang other chicks.

650
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:50,301
It keeps it equal.

651
00:30:50,302 --> 00:30:53,409
Keep the playing field flat,
you know?

652
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,748
- Flat.
- I see.

653
00:30:55,749 --> 00:30:57,419
Yeah.

654
00:30:58,754 --> 00:31:00,924
Don't say anything
about the girl.

655
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:03,029
- I thought you just said--
- Just keep your fucking mouth shut.

656
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,937
- Hi, baby.
- Hi, baby.

657
00:31:06,938 --> 00:31:08,139
Hi.

658
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,277
Mmm, I missed you.

659
00:31:12,316 --> 00:31:14,653
- Hi.
- Okay, that's enough.

660
00:31:14,654 --> 00:31:17,826
Look at my big man.
Isn't he gorgeous?

661
00:31:17,827 --> 00:31:19,730
<i>So gorgeous.</i>

662
00:31:19,731 --> 00:31:21,734
Hey, we're gonna go someplace
and hang out. You wanna come?

663
00:31:21,735 --> 00:31:24,173
Oh, no no.
Babe, I'm real tired.

664
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:26,612
Greg, damn it!
Coaster.

665
00:31:26,613 --> 00:31:28,382
I'm sorry,
I forgot.

666
00:31:28,383 --> 00:31:30,253
<i>I'm trying to keep things
nice around here.</i>

667
00:31:30,254 --> 00:31:32,825
- I mean, fuck me.
- I'm sorry.  Christ.

668
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:37,535
No no no, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

669
00:31:37,536 --> 00:31:39,839
He endures
my little outbursts.

670
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,376
<i>Don't you, baby?</i>

671
00:31:41,377 --> 00:31:43,380
Greg is going to school.

672
00:31:43,381 --> 00:31:45,685
Tell him.

673
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:51,932
Refrigeration.
Learn the heating and cooling business.

674
00:31:51,933 --> 00:31:54,938
My focus is more
on cooling.

675
00:31:54,939 --> 00:31:57,310
So, a lot of
money in that?

676
00:31:57,311 --> 00:31:59,147
Coolness?

677
00:31:59,148 --> 00:32:02,186
Global warming?
Ever hear of it?

678
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:04,424
What an idiot.

679
00:32:04,425 --> 00:32:07,096
I forgot to tell you
about my brilliant idea.

680
00:32:07,097 --> 00:32:09,268
You should come over tomorrow
night and I'll cook dinner.

681
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:12,040
- That'd be nice.
- Yeah?

682
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:13,443
You'll be home.
Right, baby?

683
00:32:13,444 --> 00:32:14,880
I guess.
I might be tired.

684
00:32:14,881 --> 00:32:16,884
Oh, no no.
You'll be fine.

685
00:32:16,885 --> 00:32:19,456
Come on.  Okay, now
I have to plan a menu.

686
00:32:19,457 --> 00:32:21,326
Oh, I'm so excited.

687
00:32:21,327 --> 00:32:24,834
Okay, I'm gonna go change.
You guys bond.

688
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:34,388
You could tell Amanda
about the girl if you want.

689
00:32:36,025 --> 00:32:38,129
But don't.

690
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,899
I'm fuckin' serious,
asshole.

691
00:32:50,656 --> 00:32:52,793
Did you love Greg?

692
00:32:52,794 --> 00:32:55,432
Don't you just love him?
He's so hot.

693
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:57,136
Don't you think
he's hot?

694
00:32:57,137 --> 00:32:58,505
Yes, he's hot.

695
00:32:58,506 --> 00:33:00,342
Hot and sociopathic.

696
00:33:00,343 --> 00:33:01,712
<i>- What?
- Nothing.</i>

697
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,749
He's very very hot.

698
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,753
He doesn't mind
your chosen profession?

699
00:33:05,754 --> 00:33:06,388
Why should he?

700
00:33:06,389 --> 00:33:08,425
My profession pays for
his school, his clothes

701
00:33:08,426 --> 00:33:10,163
and his brand-new truck.

702
00:33:10,164 --> 00:33:11,866
I keep my boy very happy.

703
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:13,202
Where are we going?

704
00:33:13,203 --> 00:33:15,607
Oh, I know a place up
the strip that doesn't card me.

705
00:33:15,608 --> 00:33:17,946
But we got to make
one more stop first.

706
00:33:21,353 --> 00:33:22,956
<i>( helicopter buzzing )</i>

707
00:33:24,994 --> 00:33:26,898
Is the car gonna
be okay here?

708
00:33:26,899 --> 00:33:28,836
<i>- Oh, yeah, sure.</i>

709
00:33:28,837 --> 00:33:30,539
How about us?

710
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,144
So, anyway, I came here--
it was, like, last year

711
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:35,816
and I got a job at the
International House of Pancakes.

712
00:33:35,817 --> 00:33:37,720
<i>- Do you know it?
- Yeah.</i>

713
00:33:37,721 --> 00:33:40,460
Yeah, I usually say IHOP,
'cause it's shorter,

714
00:33:40,461 --> 00:33:42,631
but I wasn't sure
if you'd heard of it.

715
00:33:42,632 --> 00:33:45,036
Oh, well, it lists both names
in Zagat, so I'm good.

716
00:33:45,037 --> 00:33:46,505
So, anyway,

717
00:33:46,506 --> 00:33:50,347
my friend Michelle-- she worked
with me but she was a hostess--

718
00:33:50,348 --> 00:33:52,518
she got this job
dancing at this club.

719
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:54,289
- Dancing?
- Stripping.

720
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,727
She was making huge money,
no taxes.

721
00:33:56,728 --> 00:33:58,999
- Everything under the table.
- Including Michelle, no doubt.

722
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,538
Oh, poor guy.

723
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,642
- I hate to see that.
- Mmm.

724
00:34:03,643 --> 00:34:07,216
So, anyway, she introduces me
to the owner of the club.

725
00:34:07,217 --> 00:34:09,220
Before you know it,
I'm dancing.

726
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:10,857
- Stripping?
- Yeah.

727
00:34:10,858 --> 00:34:12,961
And you just started,
just like that?

728
00:34:12,962 --> 00:34:15,767
Well, you don't really need
a lot of training to strip.

729
00:34:15,768 --> 00:34:18,507
I mean, I've taken off my clothes
every night before I go to bed.

730
00:34:18,508 --> 00:34:20,544
- You know?

731
00:34:20,545 --> 00:34:22,515
Oh, my gosh!

732
00:34:22,516 --> 00:34:24,185
- What was that?
- I don't know.

733
00:34:24,186 --> 00:34:26,222
Shit. Scared me.

734
00:34:26,223 --> 00:34:28,226
- Did you see me jump?
- Just keep walking.

735
00:34:28,227 --> 00:34:30,765
Oh my God.
So, yeah, no training.

736
00:34:30,766 --> 00:34:33,538
Except I took a
pole-dancing seminar once.

737
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:35,542
- That's it.
- They have seminars in pole dancing?

738
00:34:35,543 --> 00:34:37,747
Yeah, at the local
community college.

739
00:34:37,748 --> 00:34:40,118
Isn't Vegas the best?

740
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:43,692
I killed at the club. I had this whole
"Sweet Young Thing" working for me.

741
00:34:43,693 --> 00:34:46,298
Every guy who pays for a blowjob
wants to get it from a girl

742
00:34:46,299 --> 00:34:48,302
who looks like she's never
given one before.

743
00:34:48,303 --> 00:34:49,286
- That's my look.

744
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,542
- You do remember
I'm your uncle, right?

745
00:34:54,683 --> 00:34:56,286
- Yeah?
- Hi.

746
00:34:56,287 --> 00:34:58,290
- Is Link here?
- You picking up?

747
00:34:58,291 --> 00:34:59,826
Yeah, he knows.

748
00:34:59,827 --> 00:35:01,062
Shut the door.

749
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:04,771
This will only take
two seconds.

750
00:35:04,772 --> 00:35:05,538
Cool.

751
00:35:13,924 --> 00:35:16,094
- Hey, you want some?
- Uh, no.

752
00:35:16,095 --> 00:35:19,000
No, thanks.
I'm-- I'm married.

753
00:35:19,001 --> 00:35:21,439
- Really?
- Yeah.

754
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,324
- Oh, so is she.

755
00:35:22,325 --> 00:35:24,646
- That's nice, to have
something in common.

756
00:35:24,647 --> 00:35:26,984
<i>My mouth's watering already. </i>

757
00:35:26,985 --> 00:35:29,322
Okay, you can
come back now.

758
00:35:29,323 --> 00:35:31,827
Yeah. Enjoy.

759
00:35:31,828 --> 00:35:35,001
Here's your pony, sweetness,
all saddled up and ready to ride.

760
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:37,005
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome. You'll love it.

761
00:35:37,006 --> 00:35:38,875
- Hey, how's B.V.?
- He's great.

762
00:35:38,876 --> 00:35:41,180
Good.  Good, you tell him it should
be ready by the end of the week.

763
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:43,385
Okay.

764
00:35:43,386 --> 00:35:46,892
Hey, what's with
Principal Skinner?

765
00:35:46,893 --> 00:35:48,896
He's cool.
He's my uncle.

766
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,733
- No shit?
- Yeah.

767
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:52,003
No, none at all.
Hi.

768
00:35:52,004 --> 00:35:54,776
Hey.
Hey, your uncle?

769
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,980
Wow.
I had an uncle once.

770
00:35:56,981 --> 00:36:00,054
Or I killed some gook's uncle in 'Nam.
I can't remember which.

771
00:36:00,055 --> 00:36:01,690
- How's it going?
- Good.

772
00:36:01,691 --> 00:36:03,628
- You?
- Well, I got no legs.

773
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:05,865
I got no balls.
I piss out of a tube.

774
00:36:05,866 --> 00:36:08,003
How the fuck do you
think it's going?

775
00:36:08,004 --> 00:36:10,809
Right, but getting
the good parking spaces

776
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:13,114
must take some
of the sting out of it.

777
00:36:14,785 --> 00:36:16,253
You're funny.

778
00:36:16,254 --> 00:36:18,559
He's funny.
You're funny.

779
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,796
Thank you.
Good to meet you.

780
00:36:20,797 --> 00:36:21,999
Good to meet you.

781
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,237
I'd like to introduce you
to my better half.

782
00:36:24,238 --> 00:36:26,976
Unfortunately, it got blown off
10 kliks out the Haiphong.

783
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:29,081
You were in the shit?

784
00:36:29,082 --> 00:36:31,419
Up to my neck,
sweetie.

785
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,889
Up to my neck.

786
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,561
Hey, you want
something?

787
00:36:35,562 --> 00:36:37,899
- No, I'm good.
- Come on!

788
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,138
You're in Vegas, queer-bait.
Loosen up a little.

789
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:41,941
Good point.
You have any pot?

790
00:36:41,942 --> 00:36:43,512
Pot?

791
00:36:43,513 --> 00:36:46,785
Who the fuck smokes
pot anymore?  Pot?

792
00:36:46,786 --> 00:36:48,008
Hell, they ought to take pot,

793
00:36:48,009 --> 00:36:50,325
they ought to hang it on the
wall of a museum somewhere.

794
00:36:50,326 --> 00:36:53,398
That's how old pot is.
Pot is old, motherfucker.

795
00:36:53,399 --> 00:36:54,668
So you don't have any?

796
00:36:56,306 --> 00:36:58,676
Oh.
Hey, TJ?

797
00:36:59,914 --> 00:37:01,248
Yeah?

798
00:37:01,249 --> 00:37:02,685
Hey, go around back.
See if my mom's up.

799
00:37:05,525 --> 00:37:07,595
Pot.

800
00:37:07,596 --> 00:37:11,571
This pot is terrible.
It's all stems and seeds.

801
00:37:11,572 --> 00:37:15,512
Link's a good guy, but that
stuff in 'Nam? Never happened.

802
00:37:15,513 --> 00:37:16,948
I don't even think
it's pot.

803
00:37:16,949 --> 00:37:19,520
- Might be marjoram.
- When he was 15,

804
00:37:19,521 --> 00:37:22,961
he got drunk one night and a train
ran him over and cut him in half.

805
00:37:22,962 --> 00:37:24,498
Can you imagine that?

806
00:37:24,499 --> 00:37:26,502
Getting cut in half
by a train?

807
00:37:26,503 --> 00:37:27,838
That would suck.

808
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,407
Beats getting cut
in thirds.

809
00:37:29,408 --> 00:37:31,913
- What did you get?
- Oh, it's not for me.

810
00:37:31,914 --> 00:37:34,218
I have this friend,
she's an addict

811
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:35,888
and she got busted
a couple times,

812
00:37:35,889 --> 00:37:38,761
so I buy for her.
A little less every other week.

813
00:37:38,762 --> 00:37:41,266
- Not for you?
- I think I just said that.

814
00:37:41,267 --> 00:37:43,437
We have to make
one more stop.

815
00:37:50,052 --> 00:37:51,922
Isn't Kyoki great?

816
00:37:51,923 --> 00:37:54,727
She's, like, the best
scrabble player ever.

817
00:37:57,902 --> 00:38:00,039
What do you want
for our dinner?

818
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,576
- What?
- Tomorrow night.

819
00:38:01,577 --> 00:38:03,746
- Uh, is chicken okay?
- Oh, yeah, chicken's fine.

820
00:38:12,131 --> 00:38:14,971
- I see a pretty lady.
- Amanda!

821
00:38:14,972 --> 00:38:17,442
- Hi, cutie.
- Special delivery.

822
00:38:17,443 --> 00:38:20,248
Life saver.
Totally serious.

823
00:38:20,249 --> 00:38:23,188
- What's on your ass?
- Oh, I know. Isn't it awful?

824
00:38:23,189 --> 00:38:27,363
I'm nairing my butt.
Nair-- the hair removal shit.

825
00:38:27,364 --> 00:38:27,665
- Yeah.

826
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:29,468
- I came in tonight,
looked in the mirror.

827
00:38:29,469 --> 00:38:32,407
There was this long, huge hair
growing out of the side of my ass.

828
00:38:32,408 --> 00:38:33,643
- Gross.
- I know!

829
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,415
I started thinking,
"I can see that one."

830
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:38,219
Who knows how many more
there are back there?

831
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,457
I didn't want to risk it.
I'm nairing the whole thing.

832
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:41,860
- Oh.
- Howdy.

833
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,897
- Hello, hi.
- Trick?

834
00:38:43,898 --> 00:38:46,904
- My uncle.
- Oh. Sweet.

835
00:38:46,905 --> 00:38:49,042
<i>- This is Whisper.
- Hello, Whisper.</i>

836
00:38:49,043 --> 00:38:51,480
- Emory.
- Oh, is Emory your real name?

837
00:38:51,481 --> 00:38:53,251
No.

838
00:38:53,252 --> 00:38:55,488
I love this girl.
She is so great.

839
00:38:55,489 --> 00:38:57,192
- I'm blushing.
- I mean it.

840
00:38:57,193 --> 00:38:59,497
Most of these girls,
they're just total cunts.

841
00:38:59,498 --> 00:39:02,904
You want to smash their heads
in with a fucking rock.

842
00:39:02,905 --> 00:39:05,276
Makes me sick thinking
about you with that guy.

843
00:39:05,277 --> 00:39:06,980
Greg's nice.

844
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:10,754
Honey, nothing on this planet
with a cock attached to it is nice!

845
00:39:10,755 --> 00:39:13,026
Watch your language,
lady.

846
00:39:13,027 --> 00:39:14,830
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

847
00:39:14,831 --> 00:39:17,034
I'm still back on
that "cunts and rocks."

848
00:39:17,035 --> 00:39:19,238
- Saw B.V.
- I know!

849
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:22,212
- Looking good.
- He's gotten even bigger than before!

850
00:39:22,213 --> 00:39:23,714
I didn't think
it was possible.

851
00:39:23,715 --> 00:39:25,719
- It's disgusting!
- He's huge.

852
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,188
He picked me up once...

853
00:39:28,927 --> 00:39:31,197
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

854
00:39:31,198 --> 00:39:34,137
Club soda.  Why don't you
just kill yourself?

855
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,776
It's next on my list.

856
00:39:38,781 --> 00:39:41,552
- What?
- I can't get over it.

857
00:39:41,553 --> 00:39:44,926
- The hooker thing.
- Are you okay?

858
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:47,532
I have a home for
the first time in my life.

859
00:39:47,533 --> 00:39:49,636
You had a home when
you were a kid.

860
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,609
My parents split and I went
to go live with my dad

861
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,112
and he married Janine,

862
00:39:54,113 --> 00:39:56,951
who's this total psychotic
bitch Nazi vegan who hates me.

863
00:39:56,952 --> 00:39:58,688
So then I went to go live
with my mom,

864
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:00,826
- and she married Larry.
- Well, Larry's okay.

865
00:40:02,263 --> 00:40:04,166
Well, okay, go on.

866
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:07,039
Yeah. And then I went to
go back and live with my dad

867
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,513
and that sucked, and then his brother
started raping me, which really sucked.

868
00:40:10,514 --> 00:40:12,417
- Raping you?
- Whoa, there's a table.

869
00:40:12,418 --> 00:40:14,254
- Here-- we can sit down.
- Raping you?

870
00:40:14,255 --> 00:40:19,132
Your-- your father's
- your father's brother raped you?

871
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:21,269
Uh, my Uncle Bobby?
Yeah.

872
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,706
He raped you?

873
00:40:22,707 --> 00:40:25,545
Yeah, for, like,
eight months.

874
00:40:25,546 --> 00:40:27,883
Jesus.

875
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,820
It's old news.

876
00:40:29,821 --> 00:40:31,557
I thought I was
a shitty uncle.

877
00:40:31,558 --> 00:40:34,129
Look,
it doesn't matter.

878
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:37,069
I'm here now,
I'm happy.

879
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,140
And I have
the perfect home.

880
00:40:39,141 --> 00:40:41,445
Yeah, but look what
you have to do to get it.

881
00:40:41,446 --> 00:40:44,752
It doesn't matter. I mean, the
minute I walk through that door,

882
00:40:44,753 --> 00:40:47,658
all the sadness and all
the bullshit stays outside.

883
00:40:47,659 --> 00:40:49,562
And everybody needs that.

884
00:40:49,563 --> 00:40:52,635
You know, after a day of doing whatever
horrible, awful thing you got to do

885
00:40:52,636 --> 00:40:55,073
to make money, you need
a place to go

886
00:40:55,074 --> 00:40:59,716
where it's quiet and you can
just remember who you really are.

887
00:40:59,717 --> 00:41:03,892
And the terrible, awful thing you do--
you don't have any options?

888
00:41:05,363 --> 00:41:08,368
Yeah.  Yeah, sure, I could
go back to IHOP.

889
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:11,541
I could work there for
a whole month, with overtime,

890
00:41:11,542 --> 00:41:13,780
or I could do eight or
nine guys over a weekend

891
00:41:13,781 --> 00:41:15,316
And make the exact
same amount.

892
00:41:15,317 --> 00:41:17,220
What would you do?

893
00:41:17,221 --> 00:41:19,425
Uh, eight guys, fine.
More than that,

894
00:41:19,426 --> 00:41:22,532
I would worry I was in it for
something more than the money.

895
00:41:22,533 --> 00:41:25,771
You really don't
feel exploited?

896
00:41:25,772 --> 00:41:28,143
All I know is,

897
00:41:28,144 --> 00:41:30,982
after 20 minutes--
usually less,

898
00:41:30,983 --> 00:41:34,356
I got it all: I got their money,
I got their gratitude.

899
00:41:34,357 --> 00:41:36,928
So what if I have to let them
jizz on my tits to get it?

900
00:41:40,169 --> 00:41:41,672
What?

901
00:41:41,673 --> 00:41:44,211
It's just not every uncle
who gets to hear his niece

902
00:41:44,212 --> 00:41:46,648
say "jizz" and "tits"
in the same sentence.

903
00:41:46,649 --> 00:41:49,421
I-- I need a little air.

904
00:41:51,527 --> 00:41:53,430
<i>So listen, Amanda,</i>

905
00:41:53,431 --> 00:41:56,904
the reason I'm in town--

906
00:41:56,905 --> 00:42:00,244
your mom and your aunt
asked me to come

907
00:42:00,245 --> 00:42:02,649
because they're
worried about you.

908
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:07,325
They're thinking maybe you have
a drug problem or something.

909
00:42:07,326 --> 00:42:08,762
I don't.

910
00:42:08,763 --> 00:42:11,435
Okay.

911
00:42:11,436 --> 00:42:13,672
There's a rehab
place in Malibu--

912
00:42:13,673 --> 00:42:15,676
It's called
the Clark-something Center.

913
00:42:15,677 --> 00:42:18,950
The Clark-- Clark Baron.
Yeah, it's Clark Baron.

914
00:42:18,951 --> 00:42:21,221
You see it in
"people" magazine?

915
00:42:21,222 --> 00:42:23,293
Well, we got you a room there
with a view of the canyon--

916
00:42:23,294 --> 00:42:24,962
- What are you laughing at?

917
00:42:24,963 --> 00:42:27,334
This is perfect.

918
00:42:27,335 --> 00:42:29,506
You telling me
to go to rehab?

919
00:42:29,507 --> 00:42:31,109
Why is that so strange?

920
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:34,649
Hello, my mom and your wife
are sisters.  They talk.

921
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:37,656
I know about
your gambling problem

922
00:42:37,657 --> 00:42:40,762
and your drinking problem
and your drug problem.

923
00:42:40,763 --> 00:42:43,000
Well, those are not issues
for me anymore.

924
00:42:43,001 --> 00:42:45,874
I know all about you puking at
the Emmy's a couple years ago,

925
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:49,481
and how you lost $150,000 in
three days at the racetrack.

926
00:42:49,482 --> 00:42:52,921
She's talking about somebody else.
Do you have any ketchup for these?

927
00:42:52,922 --> 00:42:54,725
And how you got fired
from that hit show

928
00:42:54,726 --> 00:42:56,730
because you were so fuckin'
loaded the whole time.

929
00:42:56,731 --> 00:42:59,001
Hello? You're, like,
50 years old.

930
00:42:59,002 --> 00:43:02,040
- I'm 43.
- And you can't carry a checkbook

931
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:04,379
Or credit cards?
I mean, what's with that?

932
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,882
My choice.

933
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:08,488
My therapist's choice,
actually.

934
00:43:08,489 --> 00:43:10,692
Because you can't
control yourself.

935
00:43:10,693 --> 00:43:14,200
Whenever you need money or a check,
you have to ask Aunt Lorraine for it?

936
00:43:14,201 --> 00:43:17,439
- That must suck.
- Okay, my life is fucked up.

937
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,811
But it took me
43 years to get here.

938
00:43:19,812 --> 00:43:22,250
Look at you--
you're 20 years old.

939
00:43:22,251 --> 00:43:24,254
At this rate, by the time
you're my age,

940
00:43:24,255 --> 00:43:27,227
you won't be my age
because you'll be dead.

941
00:43:27,228 --> 00:43:29,999
I don't need rehab.

942
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,073
I take Extacy, but
that's just for my work,

943
00:43:33,074 --> 00:43:35,010
to get in the mood,
you know?  But...

944
00:43:35,011 --> 00:43:36,847
- Are you hooked on it?
- No.

945
00:43:36,848 --> 00:43:40,421
Unlike you, I can take something and
not become instantly addicted to it.

946
00:43:40,422 --> 00:43:42,994
I'm not an addict.
I'm in recovery.

947
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,596
You're an addict.

948
00:43:44,597 --> 00:43:47,102
- I'm getting help.
- Because you're an addict.

949
00:43:47,103 --> 00:43:49,072
I'm not an addict.

950
00:43:55,186 --> 00:43:57,457
- What is that?
- Extacy.

951
00:43:57,458 --> 00:43:59,027
I don't want it.

952
00:43:59,028 --> 00:44:01,666
No no no,
it's not for you.

953
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:03,771
I just want you to
hold onto it for me.

954
00:44:03,772 --> 00:44:05,040
No!

955
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:06,309
Because you can't.

956
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,981
Because you know,
sooner or later,

957
00:44:08,982 --> 00:44:10,618
probably sooner,

958
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:12,790
you're gonna wind up
taking it. Right?

959
00:44:12,791 --> 00:44:16,464
20 years old, you're so--
you're so goddamned smart.

960
00:44:16,465 --> 00:44:19,737
Remember, don't take it.
I'm gonna want it back.

961

<i>- Actually, no.

975
00:44:57,751 --> 00:44:59,454
Yep, definitely.

976
00:44:59,455 --> 00:45:02,460
I found Amanda.

977
00:45:02,461 --> 00:45:05,066
She's at that place--
the Inca.

978
00:45:05,067 --> 00:45:06,903
<i>- The Aztec.
- Right.</i>

979
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:10,143
<i>- Is she really hooking?
- Yep, she really is.</i>

980
00:45:10,144 --> 00:45:13,049
Oh, God.

981
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:15,053
Did you talk to her
about rehab?

982
00:45:15,054 --> 00:45:16,991
<i>She's not interested.</i>

983
00:45:16,992 --> 00:45:18,861
Taylor, you have to
get her out of there.

984
00:45:18,862 --> 00:45:21,233
Well, I'm having dinner
with her tomorrow night--

985
00:45:21,234 --> 00:45:22,837
I mean, tonight.

986
00:45:22,838 --> 00:45:26,143
<i>I'll bring it up again,
but I don't think so.</i>

987
00:45:28,049 --> 00:45:29,684
Did you take a check
from my checkbook?

988
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:34,260
- What?
- Did you?

989
00:45:34,261 --> 00:45:37,067
<i>- No.
- One's missing.</i>

990
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,538
Well, maybe you used it
and forgot about it.

991
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:43,480
It's missing from
the middle of the checkbook.

992
00:45:43,481 --> 00:45:46,153
Well, why are you looking in
the middle of your checkbook?

993
00:45:46,154 --> 00:45:48,691
Habit.

994
00:45:53,369 --> 00:45:55,706
Taylor--

995
00:45:55,707 --> 00:45:59,246
Taylor, if you took the check,
just tell me.

996
00:45:59,247 --> 00:46:02,921
Look, I'm-- you know, I'm
just here trying to help you.

997
00:46:02,922 --> 00:46:05,025
<i>I'm here trying
to help your family.</i>

998
00:46:05,026 --> 00:46:08,734
Okay, I'm just telling you,
I called the bank-- I put a stop on it.

999
00:46:08,735 --> 00:46:10,971
Well, good.

1000
00:46:10,972 --> 00:46:13,577
Good, I mean, if you lose a check,
that's what you should do.

1001
00:46:13,578 --> 00:46:16,116
I don't see how it concerns me,
but that's fine.

1002
00:46:16,117 --> 00:46:18,520
Okay.  Good.  Fine.

1003
00:46:18,521 --> 00:46:20,525
Call me after you talk
to Amanda again.

1004
00:46:20,526 --> 00:46:22,729
Right.

1005
00:46:29,979 --> 00:46:32,417
- 20,000.
- Oh, darn.

1006
00:46:32,418 --> 00:46:34,621
- Things not going too well?
- You guessed.

1007
00:46:34,622 --> 00:46:37,226
You'll turn it around,
Mr. Mendon.

1008
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:40,667
I have a feeling.
Sign, please.

1009
00:46:40,668 --> 00:46:43,807
You playing blackjack?

1010
00:46:43,808 --> 00:46:47,614
- Horses.
- Ooh, that's fun.

1011
00:46:47,615 --> 00:46:50,722
Did you ever see that movie
about the horse Seabiscuit?

1012
00:46:50,723 --> 00:46:54,229
- Yeah.
- That was a great movie.

1013
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:56,300
I think it was called
"Seabiscuit," right?

1014
00:46:56,301 --> 00:46:58,905
No, I think it was
called

1015
00:46:58,906 --> 00:47:01,611
"Steve, the story
of Seabiscuit."

1016
00:47:01,612 --> 00:47:04,250
Aw!

1017
00:47:04,251 --> 00:47:08,091
That's what I get for
asking a comedy writer.

1018
00:47:08,092 --> 00:47:10,797
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight--

1019
00:47:12,535 --> 00:47:15,673
First race at Belmont--
$2,000 to win

1020
00:47:15,674 --> 00:47:17,678
and place in the two-horse--
pass the potatoes.

1021
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:19,248
<i>all right.
One, two, three--</i>

1022
00:47:19,249 --> 00:47:21,553
<i>but look at this,
on the far outside,</i>

1023
00:47:21,554 --> 00:47:24,692
<i>Pass the Potatoes is
making a huge move!</i>

1024
00:47:24,693 --> 00:47:26,697
<i>He's picking off runners
one by one.</i>

1025
00:47:26,698 --> 00:47:29,269
<i>Pass the Potatoes
roars to the front.</i>

1026
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:31,039
<i>The rest of the field
looks like-- oh oh!</i>

1027
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,211
<i>Pass the Potatoes
took a bad step.</i>

1028
00:47:33,212 --> 00:47:34,948
<i>Oh, he's toast!</i>

1029
00:47:39,992 --> 00:47:42,864
- Cocktails.  Cocktails.
- Miss?

1030
00:47:42,865 --> 00:47:44,836
Diet coke?

1031
00:47:44,837 --> 00:47:48,844
Yeah.
And a Jameson's.  A double.

1032
00:47:50,147 --> 00:47:51,816
Quickly.

1033
00:47:54,022 --> 00:47:56,426
- 20,000.
- Ooh.

1034
00:47:56,427 --> 00:47:58,431
Ooh, hiss.

1035
00:47:58,432 --> 00:48:01,337
You're gonna turn it
around, Mr. Mendon.

1036
00:48:01,338 --> 00:48:02,940
I just know you are.

1037
00:48:02,941 --> 00:48:05,345
- I have a very strong--

1038
00:48:07,383 --> 00:48:09,387
Oh, dear.

1039
00:48:09,388 --> 00:48:10,723
Oh, dear?

1040
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:13,128
What, "Oh, dear"?

1041
00:48:13,129 --> 00:48:14,932
Two seconds.

1042
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,836
Marty?

1043
00:48:16,837 --> 00:48:19,408
<i>Okay, here's what
probably happened...</i>

1044
00:48:19,409 --> 00:48:20,977
<i>Great.  Go.</i>

1045
00:48:20,978 --> 00:48:24,285
<i>The check that my wife wrote
before the one that I gave you,</i>

1046
00:48:24,286 --> 00:48:28,026
<i>she bought a Matisse
lithograph from a gallery</i>

1047
00:48:28,027 --> 00:48:30,364
in Beverly hills.
But when she got it home,

1048
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:33,504
there was a mark on
the upper left-hand corner--

1049
00:48:33,505 --> 00:48:36,578
a smudge, so she put
a stop on the check.

1050
00:48:36,579 --> 00:48:38,982
But the bank obviously
made a mistake

1051
00:48:38,983 --> 00:48:41,254
and put a stop on
the next check,

1052
00:48:41,255 --> 00:48:43,592
which would be the check
I gave you guys.

1053
00:48:43,593 --> 00:48:47,199
That's the only explanation I
can come up with at this moment.

1054
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,803
I mean, that's all.

1055
00:48:48,804 --> 00:48:52,845
Well, look, I know
you're good for the money.

1056
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:56,151
That's not an issue.
But, my bosses,

1057
00:48:56,152 --> 00:48:58,257
you know,
the asshole brigade,

1058
00:48:58,258 --> 00:49:00,361
a different story.
You have another check?

1059
00:49:00,362 --> 00:49:03,768
- I don't.
- Okay, again, no issue between us.

1060
00:49:03,769 --> 00:49:05,906
But I have to answer
to a higher power.

1061
00:49:05,907 --> 00:49:10,015
And if the casino gets stuck with
this, then they cut off my balls,

1062
00:49:10,016 --> 00:49:12,152
- throw 'em on the craps table.
- You won't get stuck.

1063
00:49:12,153 --> 00:49:14,156
I know, I know.
That's not even a concern.

1064
00:49:14,157 --> 00:49:18,165
But until this is resolved, I won't
be able to give you any more cash.

1065
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:21,038
I'm busted, you know?
I'm down 60,000.

1066
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:21,432
- 62,000.

1067
00:49:21,433 --> 00:49:23,743
- And now you guys won't
give me a chance to get even?

1068
00:49:23,744 --> 00:49:26,081
- Is that fair?
- It's not me, Taylor.

1069
00:49:26,082 --> 00:49:28,587
I've lost a shitload of money
in this place the last few years.

1070
00:49:28,588 --> 00:49:30,591
And this is how you
treat me?

1071
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,428
I mean, come on, Michael.

1072
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:40,578
They're gonna kill me.
I'll give you five.

1073
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:42,817
- Five?
- Best I can do.

1074
00:49:42,818 --> 00:49:46,056
You're kidding? I can lose
five walking from here to there.

1075
00:49:46,057 --> 00:49:47,627
I have no doubt.

1076
00:49:47,628 --> 00:49:49,631
- Five grand.

1077
00:49:49,632 --> 00:49:53,940
Why don't I just stay and
gamble with the old ladies?

1078
00:49:53,941 --> 00:49:57,180
I'm doing you--
I'm doing you a favor.

1079
00:49:57,181 --> 00:49:59,786
- All right.
- But now you have to do one for me.

1080
00:49:59,787 --> 00:50:02,625
Look, I give you five.
You're down 67.

1081
00:50:02,626 --> 00:50:05,197
Get another check.
Have your bank wire the money.

1082
00:50:05,198 --> 00:50:07,769
- Okay.
- End of the day would be great.

1083
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:10,274
If not,
first thing tomorrow.

1084
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:12,513
Yeah.

1085
00:50:12,514 --> 00:50:14,015
Let's go to the cage.

1086
00:50:14,016 --> 00:50:16,487
- Five grand?
- You're welcome.

1087
00:50:21,198 --> 00:50:22,934
- Hey, you!
- Hey.

1088
00:50:22,935 --> 00:50:25,206
- Hi.
- Well, this is a surprise.

1089
00:50:25,207 --> 00:50:28,145
Yeah, I was just shopping next
door and I figured you'd be here.

1090
00:50:28,146 --> 00:50:29,983
Are we still on
for dinner tonight?

1091
00:50:29,984 --> 00:50:32,888
Yeah, as long as you're not having
horse, I'm looking forward to it.

1092
00:50:32,889 --> 00:50:34,792
- Good.
- Why don't you sit down

1093
00:50:34,793 --> 00:50:38,667
- and maybe change my luck?
- Aw!

1094
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:40,505
Thanks.

1095
00:50:43,245 --> 00:50:46,117
Are you drinking?
I thought you were in recovery?

1096
00:50:46,118 --> 00:50:49,423
Oh, no, that's not mine.
I've been changing seats.

1097
00:50:49,424 --> 00:50:52,229
- Jameson's?
- No.

1098
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:55,002
You just ordered this,
like, two seconds ago.

1099
00:50:55,003 --> 00:50:56,538
Thanks.

1100
00:50:58,376 --> 00:51:00,046
Wait a minute.

1101
00:51:01,383 --> 00:51:02,851
Busted!

1102
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:05,657
I'm taking a quick break
from my recovery.

1103
00:51:05,658 --> 00:51:06,894
Cheers!

1104
00:51:06,895 --> 00:51:09,933
Oh, this is sad.
This is so sad.

1105
00:51:09,934 --> 00:51:12,205
Two days in Vegas,
you're already off the wagon.

1106
00:51:12,206 --> 00:51:14,242
And I'm the one
who needs rehab?

1107
00:51:14,243 --> 00:51:15,545
How you doing?

1108
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,919
How you doin'?

1109
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,791
- Hi.
- Remember me?

1110
00:51:21,792 --> 00:51:22,860
No.

1111
00:51:22,861 --> 00:51:24,564
I think I told you
my name was Mike.

1112
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:29,374
You remember me?

1113
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:30,577
Sorry.

1114
00:51:30,578 --> 00:51:32,280
Come on, we had such
a good time,

1115
00:51:32,281 --> 00:51:33,716
I gave you an extra 50.

1116
00:51:33,717 --> 00:51:36,455
Listen, I'm really
busy right now,

1117
00:51:36,456 --> 00:51:38,861
- so thank you.
- Oh oh, sorry, yeah.

1118
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:41,867
Right right,
you're working.  Yeah.

1119
00:51:41,868 --> 00:51:44,539
And since I don't have my wallet
open, you got no use for me--

1120
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,878
She doesn't want to talk to you.
She doesn't want to talk to you, okay?

1121
00:51:46,879 --> 00:51:48,715
- Hey!  Hey!
- Huh?  What?

1122
00:51:48,716 --> 00:51:50,419
Asshole, stay out of this,
all right?

1123
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:52,523
- I'm getting security.
- This is between the whore and me.

1124
00:51:52,524 --> 00:51:54,326
- I'm getting security.
- No no no.  No, don't.

1125
00:51:54,327 --> 00:51:56,164
She sticks her ass in
my face for half an hour

1126
00:51:56,165 --> 00:51:58,368
and now she pretends
she doesn't know me.

1127
00:51:58,369 --> 00:52:00,473
Oh, wait,
I do know you.

1128
00:52:00,474 --> 00:52:03,813
I'm sorry.
Yeah, you were the guy

1129
00:52:03,814 --> 00:52:06,118
with the cock like
a roll of dimes.

1130
00:52:10,829 --> 00:52:12,665
<i>Oh, look at this.
- You don't fuckin' know me!</i>

1131
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:14,837
Never do that again.
I'll fuckin' kill you!

1132
00:52:14,838 --> 00:52:17,274
<i>- You fuckin' asshole!
- Get this fuckin' bitch off me!</i>

1133
00:52:17,275 --> 00:52:20,281
- You don't even know my name!
- Jesus, Amanda.

1134
00:52:20,282 --> 00:52:22,152
- Fuck you!
- Okay okay okay okay!

1135
00:52:22,153 --> 00:52:23,421
Get-- enough!
Enough enough!

1136
00:52:23,422 --> 00:52:25,525
Get her off!

1137
00:52:25,526 --> 00:52:28,231
- Enough!  Stop it!
- Jesus.

1138
00:52:28,232 --> 00:52:30,569
Enough! If you want to
fight, then go somewhere else.

1139
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:31,905
- Get off me!
- Back up!

1140
00:52:31,906 --> 00:52:33,943
What's going on?

1141
00:52:33,944 --> 00:52:36,148
Nothing.

1142
00:52:36,149 --> 00:52:39,154
It's-- it's okay.
Sorry.

1143
00:52:43,464 --> 00:52:45,133
- She with you?
- Yeah.

1144
00:52:45,134 --> 00:52:46,937
Yeah, I'm with him.
I guess that means

1145
00:52:46,938 --> 00:52:48,941
you can't take me in
the back and rough me up, huh?

1146
00:52:48,942 --> 00:52:50,311
I'm gonna go to
the bathroom

1147
00:52:50,312 --> 00:52:52,817
unless you'd like me to
piss myself right here.

1148
00:52:52,818 --> 00:52:55,923
I'll see you tonight.
Asshole.

1149
00:52:55,924 --> 00:52:57,660
She's my niece.

1150
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:55,748
Excuse me?

1151
00:53:55,749 --> 00:53:58,287
Could you get me another
Jameson's on the rocks, please?

1152
00:53:58,288 --> 00:54:00,926
You know, why don't you bring
me two Jameson's with water?

1153
00:54:00,927 --> 00:54:02,930
That way I won't have to
keep bugging you.

1154
00:54:02,931 --> 00:54:05,236
Hello?  Oh, God,
I hate this place.

1155
00:54:07,074 --> 00:54:09,344
Taylor?
Hey, how you doin'?

1156
00:54:09,345 --> 00:54:12,083
Hey. Hey, Tony.
How's things at I.C.M.?

1157
00:54:12,084 --> 00:54:15,757
It's C.A.A. now. I went over to
the dark side about a year ago.

1158
00:54:15,758 --> 00:54:18,630
You're out early.
Wedding's not till 7:00.

1159
00:54:18,631 --> 00:54:19,766
What wedding?

1160
00:54:19,767 --> 00:54:20,902
Billy Gerald's.

1161
00:54:20,903 --> 00:54:22,739
I mean, you worked
with him, right?

1162
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:24,342
Well, he worked for me.
Yeah.

1163
00:54:24,343 --> 00:54:27,048
So you're not invited
to the, uh...?

1164
00:54:27,049 --> 00:54:28,818
No.

1165
00:54:28,819 --> 00:54:31,089
See, I thought that it
was weird seeing you here.

1166
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:34,129
You know, Billy's always telling that
story about how you pissed in his jacuzzi,

1167
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:35,599
some party three years ago.

1168
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,169
Never used it again,
you know.

1169
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:39,273
Yeah, well, I went through
a rough patch back then.

1170
00:54:39,274 --> 00:54:41,779
I hear you, pal.
Hey, speaking of rough patches,

1171
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:44,484
you got totally boned on the
Begley thing. Guy's a dick.

1172
00:54:44,485 --> 00:54:46,288
What are you
talking about?

1173
00:54:46,289 --> 00:54:48,292
You don't know?

1174
00:54:49,362 --> 00:54:51,298
Jesus, Taylor.
Sorry.

1175
00:54:53,571 --> 00:54:55,307
I just read it.

1176
00:55:00,285 --> 00:55:03,190
Johnny-- Johnny, I can't
believe you couldn't reach me.

1177
00:55:03,191 --> 00:55:05,729
I've been here
for two days.

1178
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:07,699
I haven't checked
my messages.

1179
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:10,205
I've been dealing
with this family thing.

1180
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:11,808
Yes, in Vegas.

1181
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:14,013
I mean, I have to
hear about it

1182
00:55:14,014 --> 00:55:15,816
from fucking Tony Clark?

1183
00:55:17,822 --> 00:55:20,059
What do you mean, have I
been talking to C.A.A.?

1184
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:22,998
This isn't about you.
This is about me getting fired

1185
00:55:22,999 --> 00:55:26,572
and me finding the story
buried on page three.

1186
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,844
Yeah, I don't rate
the fuckin' cover?

1187
00:55:28,845 --> 00:55:31,550
You know, maybe I should
be talking to C.A.A., Johnny.

1188
00:55:31,551 --> 00:55:33,019
How about that?

1189
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:33,854
Yeah, fuck--

1190
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:36,360
Shit.

1191
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:43,108
- Here you go.
- Smells delicious.

1192
00:55:43,109 --> 00:55:46,214
Thank you.  I made
the sauce from scratch.

1193
00:55:46,215 --> 00:55:48,218
Baby-- iPod.

1194
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:49,788
- What? What?
- Off. Off.

1195
00:55:49,789 --> 00:55:51,959
And please put
your napkin on your lap.

1196
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,133
Thank you. It's actually
not really from scratch.

1197
00:55:55,134 --> 00:55:58,741
It's from a jar, but I added
some extra stuff of my own.

1198
00:55:58,742 --> 00:56:00,778
I thought we were
having chicken?

1199
00:56:00,779 --> 00:56:03,050
We are, but this
is the first course.

1200
00:56:03,051 --> 00:56:04,619
We're being fancy
tonight, baby.

1201
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:07,392
- I want chicken.
- It's coming.

1202
00:56:07,393 --> 00:56:09,897
Eat your pasta.

1203
00:56:13,673 --> 00:56:15,943
This is fun.

1204
00:56:15,944 --> 00:56:18,348
We should have people
over more often.

1205
00:56:18,349 --> 00:56:21,188
What's that
supposed to mean?

1206
00:56:21,189 --> 00:56:22,390
Nothing.

1207
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:27,468
You told her.
You fuck!

1208
00:56:27,469 --> 00:56:29,004
What are you
talking about?

1209
00:56:29,005 --> 00:56:30,874
Thanks a lot,
asshole.

1210
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:33,013
- I didn't tell her anything.
- Oh, yeah?

1211
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:34,415
I didn't.

1212
00:56:39,427 --> 00:56:41,397
Pasta looks good.

1213
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,401
What do you think
he told me?

1214
00:56:43,402 --> 00:56:45,305
Nothing.

1215
00:56:45,306 --> 00:56:46,675
Greg.

1216
00:56:46,676 --> 00:56:49,881
- Greg?
- I'm eating here.

1217
00:56:49,882 --> 00:56:53,088
Can't you see that?
Jesus, I had a rough day at school.

1218
00:56:53,089 --> 00:56:54,725
All I want to do
is eat my dinner

1219
00:56:54,726 --> 00:56:56,629
without people jumping
all over my ass.

1220
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:59,769
You're right.
I'm sorry.

1221
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:01,940
Why are you such a nagging
bitch all the time?

1222
00:57:04,346 --> 00:57:07,151
- He had a girl in the house.
- Fuck you.

1223
00:57:07,152 --> 00:57:09,489
<i>- When?
- Yesterday.</i>

1224
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:11,693
You were up
in the bathroom.

1225
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:13,631
Big news.
She knows.

1226
00:57:13,632 --> 00:57:16,136
I told him about our deal.
He thinks he's busting my balls.

1227
00:57:16,137 --> 00:57:18,241
Go ahead, ask her.
She doesn't fuckin' care, dude.

1228
00:57:18,242 --> 00:57:21,548
That's right.
I-- I don't care,

1229
00:57:21,549 --> 00:57:24,153
unless the girl
was inside my home.

1230
00:57:24,154 --> 00:57:25,957
Greg, you know
the rules!

1231
00:57:25,958 --> 00:57:27,961
It's my home too.
You said.

1232
00:57:27,962 --> 00:57:30,100
No, this place
is sacred.

1233
00:57:30,101 --> 00:57:31,970
Yeah, sacred.
What am I supposed to do?

1234
00:57:31,971 --> 00:57:34,208
Some chick wants to do me, I'm supposed
to say we have to go to her place

1235
00:57:34,209 --> 00:57:36,313
because I'm not allowed to
screw chicks in my own home?

1236
00:57:36,314 --> 00:57:38,082
I mean, how do you think
that makes me feel?

1237
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:39,686
Why don't you just
cut my balls off?

1238
00:57:39,687 --> 00:57:41,022
- Use this.
- Fuck you.

1239
00:57:41,023 --> 00:57:42,926
Don't talk
to my uncle like that.

1240
00:57:42,927 --> 00:57:45,131
You're taking his side on this?
Fuck you too then!

1241
00:57:45,132 --> 00:57:47,269
<i>I mean, come on, baby.
We had a good thing going here.</i>

1242
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:49,273
<i>This guy shows up and
it's nothing but trouble.</i>

1243
00:57:49,274 --> 00:57:51,477
Okay, um, can we
please

1244
00:57:51,478 --> 00:57:53,616
just talk about
something else?

1245
00:57:53,617 --> 00:57:56,288
I just would like
to have a nice dinner.

1246
00:57:56,289 --> 00:57:58,859
Let's just change
the subject.

1247
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:02,167
Fine.

1248
00:58:02,168 --> 00:58:04,304
She had her shoes on
in the house.

1249
00:58:04,305 --> 00:58:06,108
Greg, damn it!

1250
00:58:06,109 --> 00:58:08,180
You know what?
Fuck this. Here.

1251
00:58:08,181 --> 00:58:10,184
- You happy?

1252
00:58:10,185 --> 00:58:12,288
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me?

1253
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:14,325
My fuckin' dinner's ruined.
That's what's the matter with me.

1254
00:58:14,326 --> 00:58:15,929
I didn't even get to
eat my chicken.

1255
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:17,799
You know what?
Fuckin' keep your chicken. I'm done.

1256
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,971
Oh my God!  No no, don't get up,
don't get up. It'll get on the carpet.

1257
00:58:19,972 --> 00:58:21,775
<i>- No no no no, baby!</i>

1258
00:58:21,776 --> 00:58:26,083
Um, come back, please please.
Greg!  I'll get the chicken!

1259
00:58:26,084 --> 00:58:27,520
<i>It's too late!</i>

1260
00:58:33,534 --> 00:58:37,040
Um, I'm sorry.

1261
00:58:37,041 --> 00:58:38,978
So much for
my fancy dinner.

1262
00:58:38,979 --> 00:58:41,550
I'll go get
some paper towels.

1263
00:58:45,959 --> 00:58:48,197
You fuck this up for me
and I'll kill you!

1264
00:58:48,198 --> 00:58:50,067
What are you gonna do?
Refrigerate me to death?

1265
00:58:56,448 --> 00:58:58,853
Oh.
Oh, shit.

1266
00:59:03,497 --> 00:59:05,500
<i>We must do dinner again.</i>

1267
00:59:05,501 --> 00:59:07,771
<i>Warn me.
I'll wear my best tarp.</i>

1268
00:59:07,772 --> 00:59:09,474
I'm sorry about Greg.

1269
00:59:09,475 --> 00:59:12,013
He's just
really sensitive.

1270
00:59:12,014 --> 00:59:14,117
I got that when
he threatened to kill me.

1271
00:59:14,118 --> 00:59:16,623
Why are you
with that asshole?

1272
00:59:16,624 --> 00:59:20,532
Well, you know how you have
this image in your head

1273
00:59:20,533 --> 00:59:22,803
of the perfect person
for you?

1274
00:59:22,804 --> 00:59:25,910
I met Greg,
and he was

1275
00:59:25,911 --> 00:59:28,214
my mental perfect
image come to life.

1276
00:59:28,215 --> 00:59:30,018
Emphasis on the "mental."

1277
00:59:30,019 --> 00:59:32,657
You do realize he's
not at all perfect?

1278
00:59:32,658 --> 00:59:37,200
When you change out that lamp,
you might want to take him along.

1279
00:59:37,201 --> 00:59:39,004
What can I say?

1280
00:59:39,005 --> 00:59:42,278
He-- he looks right.

1281
00:59:42,279 --> 00:59:45,384
You know? So maybe
if I keep loving him,

1282
00:59:45,385 --> 00:59:48,624
then he'll be right.

1283
00:59:48,625 --> 00:59:50,628
Do you want to gamble?

1284
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:52,966
Let's go gamble. You can
win me some big money.

1285
00:59:52,967 --> 00:59:55,305
Okay, I'll go and change
out of these clothes.

1286
00:59:55,306 --> 00:59:57,108
Okay.
Well, hurry.

1287
00:59:57,109 --> 01:00:00,148
I'll wait here.
I got the fever.

1288
01:00:29,511 --> 01:00:30,679
<i>Sir? - A little one.</i>

1289
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,416
I'll get it.

1290
01:00:32,417 --> 01:00:34,120
Bless you.

1291
01:00:34,121 --> 01:00:35,790
<i>60, 20...</i>

1292
01:00:35,791 --> 01:00:38,161
How you liking
that recovery break?

1293
01:00:38,162 --> 01:00:39,665
It's been great.

1294
01:00:39,666 --> 01:00:42,504
But I've decided I'm going
right back to recovery

1295
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:45,376
<i>- right after my next drink.</i>

1296
01:00:45,377 --> 01:00:46,813
Oh.

1297
01:00:48,183 --> 01:00:50,187
I gotta make a call.

1298
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:52,024
Okay, but come
right back.

1299
01:00:52,025 --> 01:00:53,861
We have to talk
about rehab again.

1300
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:00,909
Oh, shit.
Shit.

1301
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:04,350
- Here you go.
- Oh, could you bring me another one?

1302
01:01:04,351 --> 01:01:06,688
Make it a double
because I'm going--

1303
01:01:06,689 --> 01:01:08,726
I'm going to quit
drinking right after.

1304
01:01:08,727 --> 01:01:10,830
- 'Kay.
- Thank you.

1305
01:01:10,831 --> 01:01:13,302
Hey, how's it going,
handsome?

1306
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:14,872
Hey, I am handsome.

1307
01:01:16,777 --> 01:01:20,417
Uh, is there any news on
the money from the bank?

1308
01:01:20,418 --> 01:01:22,421
I don't want to push
but they're asking.

1309
01:01:22,422 --> 01:01:24,025
Oh, yeah, I'm on it.
I called

1310
01:01:24,026 --> 01:01:26,397
and they can do a transfer
first thing in the morning.

1311
01:01:26,398 --> 01:01:27,899
Excellent.
Thank you, sir.

1312
01:01:30,339 --> 01:01:32,008
I can get you better.

1313
01:01:32,009 --> 01:01:34,179
What do you mean?

1314
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:35,749
Your little friend?

1315
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:38,889
I can get you one who's
not so trashy.

1316
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:40,927
She's my niece.

1317
01:01:40,928 --> 01:01:44,200
I can get you
a better niece.

1318
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:46,605
How about
a black niece?

1319
01:01:46,606 --> 01:01:50,346
Uh, naughty little
Asian niece?

1320
01:01:50,347 --> 01:01:52,317
"Me so horny."

1321
01:01:53,755 --> 01:01:55,825
Hi, there.

1322
01:01:55,826 --> 01:01:57,929
- Hi.
- Have a good evening.

1323
01:01:59,767 --> 01:02:01,771
- Who's that?
- Some guy.

1324
01:02:01,772 --> 01:02:02,940
Hello.

1325
01:02:08,219 --> 01:02:10,689
Are you okay?

1326
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:13,428
Yeah, I'm--

1327
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:16,468
I didn't sleep much--
sleep much last night.

1328
01:02:19,776 --> 01:02:23,550
Ah. Ha ha!
That was weird.

1329
01:02:23,551 --> 01:02:25,554
Oh my God.

1330
01:02:25,555 --> 01:02:26,823
You took the X.

1331
01:02:26,824 --> 01:02:28,928
- No.
- Yes, you took it.

1332
01:02:28,929 --> 01:02:30,264
No, I did not.

1333
01:02:30,265 --> 01:02:32,636
- Then give it back to me.
- I took it.

1334
01:02:32,637 --> 01:02:35,675
I took it.
It's great.

1335
01:02:35,676 --> 01:02:38,080
It's really great.

1336
01:02:38,081 --> 01:02:40,251
Am I talking loud?

1337
01:02:40,252 --> 01:02:42,490
Is this too loud,
how I'm talking now?

1338
01:02:44,695 --> 01:02:47,433
<i>You know,
you really really</i>

1339
01:02:47,434 --> 01:02:50,606
<i>really should take me up
on this offer.</i>

1340
01:02:50,607 --> 01:02:53,345
<i>It's $15,000,
but I think it is--</i>

1341
01:02:53,346 --> 01:02:55,584
<i>it is so worth it.</i>

1342
01:02:55,585 --> 01:02:58,991
'Cause you have to get
your life on the right path.

1343
01:02:58,992 --> 01:03:01,964
You do.
It's important.

1344
01:03:01,965 --> 01:03:04,001
Or you could just
fuck it.

1345
01:03:09,547 --> 01:03:11,150
You're great,
you know?

1346
01:03:11,151 --> 01:03:13,220
<i>You are.</i>

1347
01:03:13,221 --> 01:03:15,459
I don't think I've ever
told you that before,

1348
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:18,265
but you really are.
You are really really--

1349
01:03:18,266 --> 01:03:19,033
you're great.

1350
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:22,741
Yeah?

1351
01:03:22,742 --> 01:03:25,045
Would you be saying that
if you weren't so fucked up?

1352
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,726
Oh, it must be hard
being a hooker.

1353
01:03:31,727 --> 01:03:34,632
I don't think
I could do it.

1354
01:03:34,633 --> 01:03:37,038
I think I would
rather kill myself.

1355
01:03:39,443 --> 01:03:41,681
You know...

1356
01:03:41,682 --> 01:03:44,453
The first time
I ever did it,

1357
01:03:44,454 --> 01:03:46,557
I was here
at this hotel.

1358
01:03:48,529 --> 01:03:52,135
These guys came from,
like, Iowa

1359
01:03:52,136 --> 01:03:54,941
or someplace like that
for this bachelor party

1360
01:03:54,942 --> 01:03:58,082
and me and this other girl
came over to entertain.

1361
01:04:00,187 --> 01:04:03,994
And you could just tell that
they'd been talking for months,

1362
01:04:03,995 --> 01:04:07,434
like, "Oh, dude, we're
gonna go to Vegas.

1363
01:04:07,435 --> 01:04:11,009
We're gonna
get some hookers."

1364
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:13,080
They were horrified.

1365
01:04:14,651 --> 01:04:17,322
They just stood there

1366
01:04:17,323 --> 01:04:19,594
and stared at us like we
were exhibits at a zoo.

1367
01:04:23,169 --> 01:04:26,141
And this one guy, um...

1368
01:04:26,142 --> 01:04:29,815
he took me
into the bathroom,

1369
01:04:29,816 --> 01:04:32,187
he pushed me down
on my knees

1370
01:04:32,188 --> 01:04:34,592
and he stuck
his cock in my mouth.

1371
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:38,601
He came in, like,
two seconds.

1372
01:04:41,407 --> 01:04:43,143
And he zipped up,

1373
01:04:43,144 --> 01:04:44,613
Walked out.

1374
01:04:47,186 --> 01:04:49,624
Didn't say one word
to me.

1375
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:56,404
You know...

1376
01:04:56,405 --> 01:04:59,210
It's funny.

1377
01:04:59,211 --> 01:05:02,817
When you do
something like that,

1378
01:05:02,818 --> 01:05:05,156
It's who you are
for the rest of your life.

1379
01:05:09,733 --> 01:05:13,573
You could stop, but...

1380
01:05:13,574 --> 01:05:16,647
really, what's the point?
I mean...

1381
01:05:22,962 --> 01:05:25,165
you're always gonna
be that girl...

1382
01:05:27,438 --> 01:05:29,674
on her knees on
the bathroom floor.

1383
01:05:35,187 --> 01:05:37,190
And you know it.

1384
01:05:40,966 --> 01:05:42,167
<i>Mmm.</i>

1385
01:05:49,851 --> 01:05:52,022
<i>Hello?</i>

1386
01:05:52,023 --> 01:05:53,659
<i>Mr. Mendon?</i>

1387
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:54,694
Mmmm.

1388
01:05:56,465 --> 01:05:58,702
Hello?

1389
01:06:01,175 --> 01:06:03,746
- Yeah?
- Are you okay?

1390
01:06:03,747 --> 01:06:07,387
What are you--
what are you doing?

1391
01:06:07,388 --> 01:06:08,823
What-- what time is it?

1392
01:06:08,824 --> 01:06:10,861
<i>It's 10 to 5:00.</i>

1393
01:06:10,862 --> 01:06:14,401
Why are you--
10 to 5:00?

1394
01:06:14,402 --> 01:06:16,707
10 to 5:00
in the afternoon.

1395
01:06:16,708 --> 01:06:18,844
What?

1396
01:06:18,845 --> 01:06:21,049
Is it still today?

1397
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:22,720
It's Saturday.

1398
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:26,193
Mr. Mendon.

1399
01:06:26,194 --> 01:06:27,730
Congratulations again.

1400
01:06:31,105 --> 01:06:33,909
Mr. Mendon!

1401
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:36,749
See?  I told you
you'd turn it around.

1402
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:38,252
Good for you!

1403
01:06:43,631 --> 01:06:46,870
I have never seen
anything like it.

1404
01:06:46,871 --> 01:06:50,712
You were hot as balls!
Blackjack, roulette.

1405
01:06:50,713 --> 01:06:52,281
When was this?

1406
01:06:52,282 --> 01:06:53,618
Last night.

1407
01:06:53,619 --> 01:06:54,553
When?

1408
01:06:54,554 --> 01:06:56,757
Uh...

1409
01:06:56,758 --> 01:06:59,163
I saw you around 9:00.

1410
01:06:59,164 --> 01:07:01,601
You were, ha ha,
pretty good.

1411
01:07:01,602 --> 01:07:03,539
The gaming gods
were smiling on you.

1412
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:06,445
Uh, last time I saw you
was just before 2:00

1413
01:07:06,446 --> 01:07:09,651
When you cashed out. And listen, I was
able to buy you a little extra time,

1414
01:07:09,652 --> 01:07:11,789
you know, on the check,
because of your big win.

1415
01:07:11,790 --> 01:07:15,129
So just pay the cage
the 67,000

1416
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:17,134
When you get the chance.

1417
01:07:17,135 --> 01:07:19,138
How much did
I cash in for?

1418
01:07:19,139 --> 01:07:22,211
You-- you don't remember?

1419
01:07:22,212 --> 01:07:24,983
I'm a little hazy.

1420
01:07:24,984 --> 01:07:29,426
Hey, if I cashed in
$186,000,

1421
01:07:29,427 --> 01:07:30,796
the last thing I'd be
is hazy.

1422
01:08:03,466 --> 01:08:04,834
Shit.

1423
01:08:11,315 --> 01:08:13,552
<i>- What?
- Hello.</i>

1424
01:08:13,553 --> 01:08:14,788
Hi.

1425
01:08:14,789 --> 01:08:16,793
<i>- Where have you been?
- In my room.</i>

1426
01:08:16,794 --> 01:08:19,364
Well, I called a dozen times
last night and today

1427
01:08:19,365 --> 01:08:20,901
and the phone
just kept ringing.

1428
01:08:20,902 --> 01:08:22,671
<i>Well, I was
with Amanda. </i>

1429
01:08:22,672 --> 01:08:25,777
Uh-huh.
And you're still there

1430
01:08:25,778 --> 01:08:28,383
so I'm assuming she doesn't
want to go to rehab.

1431
01:08:28,384 --> 01:08:30,722
<i>- She's not interested.
- Taylor.</i>

1432
01:08:30,723 --> 01:08:32,826
Look, what am I supposed
to do?  Kidnap her?

1433
01:08:32,827 --> 01:08:35,966
It doesn't work that way. You can't
help people who don't want to be helped.

1434
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:39,206
You know, you never really
intended to help her, did you?

1435
01:08:39,207 --> 01:08:43,582
- What?
- This trip was just all about you.

1436
01:08:43,583 --> 01:08:46,054
You and your
fucking gambling!

1437
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:49,728
Listen, I haven't gambled one
penny all day. That's the truth.

1438
01:08:49,729 --> 01:08:53,303
<i>The bank called.</i>

1439
01:08:53,304 --> 01:08:56,042
They get a call from
the casino about a check?

1440
01:08:56,043 --> 01:08:58,413
For $100,000?

1441
01:08:58,414 --> 01:09:00,585
What check?

1442
01:09:00,586 --> 01:09:02,589
Oh, stop it, please.
Just stop it.

1443
01:09:02,590 --> 01:09:05,996
The check you took from my drawer.
The check you told me you didn't take!

1444
01:09:05,997 --> 01:09:08,100
Listen, I make the money
that goes into the account.

1445
01:09:08,101 --> 01:09:10,339
<i>- I'm the one who--
- Oh, Taylor, please stop!</i>

1446
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:12,944
- Well, if it's about the money--
- It's not about the money!

1447
01:09:12,945 --> 01:09:16,351
You have no clue what it's about
so please just stop talking

1448
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:19,925
while I have the smallest
amount of respect left for you.

1449
01:09:31,317 --> 01:09:33,420
Why did I think
this would work?

1450
01:09:39,935 --> 01:09:43,809
I thought if I loved you enough,
you wouldn't fuck me over.

1451
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:47,817
<i>But you don't care
about me, Taylor.</i>

1452
01:09:47,818 --> 01:09:49,287
I do.

1453
01:09:49,288 --> 01:09:52,327
<i>No, you don't.</i>

1454
01:09:52,328 --> 01:09:54,431
You only care
about yourself

1455
01:09:54,432 --> 01:09:57,471
and those stupid horses.

1456
01:10:02,349 --> 01:10:03,684
Don't come home.

1457
01:10:03,685 --> 01:10:05,087
What does that mean?

1458
01:10:05,088 --> 01:10:06,957
<i>I called a lawyer.</i>

1459
01:10:09,597 --> 01:10:11,734
So-- so what am I
supposed to do now?

1460
01:10:11,735 --> 01:10:13,404
Beg you for another chance?

1461
01:10:13,405 --> 01:10:15,643
<i>Lorraine?</i>

1462
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:18,315
Uh, I'm such an idiot.

1463
01:10:18,316 --> 01:10:19,484
Lorrai--

1464
01:10:35,351 --> 01:10:37,889
<i>Hi, we're not here.
Leave a message.</i>

1465
01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:39,826
Lorraine, pick up
the phone.

1466
01:10:39,827 --> 01:10:43,334
<i>Lorraine, please
pick up the phone.</i>

1467
01:10:43,335 --> 01:10:45,872
<i>Hello?
You're scaring me.</i>

1468
01:10:45,873 --> 01:10:49,680
<i>You're-- if that's what you were
trying to do, you've succeeded.</i>

1469
01:10:49,681 --> 01:10:53,221
Hell-- listen, I'll stop gambling.  I promise.

1470
01:10:53,222 --> 01:10:54,858
Please?

1471
01:10:54,859 --> 01:10:56,462
Please--

1472
01:10:56,463 --> 01:10:58,332
What do you want
me to do?

1473
01:10:58,333 --> 01:10:59,534
Lorraine?

1474
01:11:29,733 --> 01:11:34,040
You misplaced $186,000
in cash and chips?

1475
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:35,544
How does that happen?

1476
01:11:35,545 --> 01:11:38,650
Sometimes I hide the money
if I have a really big score.

1477
01:11:38,651 --> 01:11:41,222
I tore my room apart.
It's not there.

1478
01:11:41,223 --> 01:11:42,959
Oh, Christ.

1479
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,231
Listen, that girl that
you saw me with last night?

1480
01:11:45,232 --> 01:11:47,202
- I think she has the money.
- The-- the hooker?

1481
01:11:47,203 --> 01:11:49,206
She's not a hooker.

1482
01:11:49,207 --> 01:11:51,811
Who gives a shit?
What am I gonna do now?

1483
01:11:51,812 --> 01:11:53,281
<i>What are you gonna
do now?</i>

1484
01:11:53,282 --> 01:11:55,719
I put my ass on the line
for you-- that five grand?

1485
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:57,456
What if my bosses
hold me responsible?

1486
01:11:57,457 --> 01:11:59,260
I don't have that kind
of money to throw around

1487
01:11:59,261 --> 01:12:00,530
just 'cause
you're a fuck-up.

1488
01:12:00,531 --> 01:12:02,567
What?  What did you
just call me?

1489
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:03,717
- What did you just call me?

1490
01:12:03,718 --> 01:12:05,440
- And there's still
nothing from your bank.

1491
01:12:05,441 --> 01:12:07,210
Well, there might be
a problem with that.

1492
01:12:07,211 --> 01:12:09,181
You see, my wife called
and I have a little trouble--

1493
01:12:09,182 --> 01:12:11,018
Just forget it!

1494
01:12:11,019 --> 01:12:13,557
I knew you'd fuck me over.
It's my own fault.

1495
01:12:13,558 --> 01:12:16,763
- Get out of here.
- What are you doing?

1496
01:12:16,764 --> 01:12:19,770
What are you doing?  Wait.
You're kicking me out?

1497
01:12:19,771 --> 01:12:21,541
Yeah, that's what
I'm doing.

1498
01:12:21,542 --> 01:12:24,080
What about this?

1499
01:12:24,081 --> 01:12:26,717
What about
the relationship, huh?

1500
01:12:26,718 --> 01:12:29,423
- Or was that all bullshit?
- Do I have to call security?

1501
01:12:29,424 --> 01:12:30,960
You never really
wanted me to win.

1502
01:12:30,961 --> 01:12:33,899
Hey, asshole,
I want everyone to win.

1503
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:36,538
But the funny thing?
It doesn't work out that way.

1504
01:12:36,539 --> 01:12:38,577
Some people win.
Most people lose.

1505
01:12:38,578 --> 01:12:40,781
The mistake everybody makes
is they keep coming back.

1506
01:12:40,782 --> 01:12:43,954
But I have to tell you?
The king of fuckin' losers?

1507
01:12:43,955 --> 01:12:45,157
You prick!

1508
01:12:49,701 --> 01:12:53,674
Hey, call security.
This man just tried to attack me.

1509
01:12:53,675 --> 01:12:54,643
Okay.

1510
01:12:59,989 --> 01:13:01,157
All right.

1511
01:13:04,331 --> 01:13:07,170
Oh, congratulations again,
Mr. Mendon!

1512
01:13:17,827 --> 01:13:19,529
- Hi.
- Hello.

1513
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:22,000
- You a friend of Greg's?
- No, Amanda's.

1514
01:13:22,001 --> 01:13:25,308
- Is she home?
- God, I hope not. That'd be weird.

1515
01:13:25,309 --> 01:13:27,278
Greg said she'd be
out until late.

1516
01:13:27,279 --> 01:13:28,915
Is-- is she working?

1517
01:13:28,916 --> 01:13:30,853
No, she's with
some friends at a club.

1518
01:13:30,854 --> 01:13:33,258
Your nose is bleeding.

1519
01:13:33,259 --> 01:13:34,494
Which club?

1520
01:13:34,495 --> 01:13:36,765
God, he told me.
Let me think.

1521
01:13:36,766 --> 01:13:39,371
The Thaiger--
the Thaiger Club.

1522
01:13:39,372 --> 01:13:41,108
It's not spelled
like the animal.

1523
01:13:41,109 --> 01:13:44,716
It's Thaiger, T-h-a-i.
Like the food.

1524
01:13:44,717 --> 01:13:47,989
- Like the country?
- It's a country too?

1525
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:50,093
Where is it?

1526
01:13:50,094 --> 01:13:51,329
The country?

1527
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:53,333
The club.

1528
01:13:53,334 --> 01:13:56,908
It's in North Vegas
on Viceroy, I think.

1529
01:13:56,909 --> 01:13:59,346
Viceroy?
Thank you.

1530
01:13:59,347 --> 01:14:00,882
Take your shoes off.

1531
01:14:03,556 --> 01:14:06,728
<i># one, two--
one, two, three! #</i>

1532
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:42,270
Hey.

1533
01:14:44,475 --> 01:14:45,844
Hey.

1534
01:14:45,845 --> 01:14:48,449
Hi.  Are you
ever going home?

1535
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:49,852
We need to talk.

1536
01:14:49,853 --> 01:14:51,722
What?
I can't hear you.

1537
01:14:51,723 --> 01:14:53,293
We need to talk,
you and me.

1538
01:15:03,950 --> 01:15:06,119
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

1539
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:07,690
Don't screw with me,
Amanda.

1540
01:15:07,691 --> 01:15:10,095
- Where is my money?
- You gave me $2,000.

1541
01:15:10,096 --> 01:15:11,765
You said I was
your good-luck charm.

1542
01:15:11,766 --> 01:15:14,203
If you think I'm gonna give it back
to you, you can go fuck yourself.

1543
01:15:14,204 --> 01:15:16,208
- Don't talk to me like that.
- I'm going home.

1544
01:15:16,209 --> 01:15:18,012
Oh, you are?  Yeah,
why don't you do that?

1545
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:20,216
Why don't we take a trip
to your sacred place

1546
01:15:20,217 --> 01:15:23,857
and say hi to Greg and the chick
that he's banging as we speak

1547
01:15:23,858 --> 01:15:25,408
- and then you can
give me my damn money!

1548
01:15:25,409 --> 01:15:25,961
- Leave me alone.

1549
01:15:25,962 --> 01:15:27,665
Don't walk away
from me, Amanda.

1550
01:15:27,666 --> 01:15:29,870
Don't touch me!
Don't you dare fucking touch me!

1551
01:15:29,871 --> 01:15:32,976
Okay.  Listen, Amanda. I'm not
fucking around. I need the money.

1552
01:15:32,977 --> 01:15:35,415
- No, I'm not fucking around!
- It's $186,000!

1553
01:15:35,416 --> 01:15:36,817
- Get out of my life!
- I won the money.

1554
01:15:36,818 --> 01:15:37,886
- I want it back!
- I swear to God!

1555
01:15:37,887 --> 01:15:39,156
Whoa, hey, whoa,
what's this?

1556
01:15:39,157 --> 01:15:40,960
Shit.

1557
01:15:40,961 --> 01:15:43,064
You okay, Amanda?

1558
01:15:43,065 --> 01:15:45,636
Yeah, I'm fine, B.V.
I'm fine.

1559
01:15:45,637 --> 01:15:49,044
So you like to rough up the
ladies, huh? That's your thing?

1560
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:51,181
She's my niece.

1561
01:15:51,182 --> 01:15:53,720
No, he really is
my uncle, B.V.

1562
01:15:53,721 --> 01:15:56,859
That ain't the answer
B.V. Was looking for.

1563
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:58,363
She has my money.

1564
01:15:58,364 --> 01:15:59,665
<i>Yeah, and knowing my girl,</i>

1565
01:15:59,667 --> 01:16:01,737
<i>She did something real nice
to make that money.</i>

1566
01:16:01,738 --> 01:16:03,507
So that makes it her money.

1567
01:16:03,508 --> 01:16:05,845
That's how it works,
chump.

1568
01:16:07,616 --> 01:16:09,119
Take this asshole
in back.

1569
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,622
Hey, whoa, hey!

1570
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:14,497
What?  No no no no! B.V., no,
he really is my uncle, I swear.

1571
01:16:14,498 --> 01:16:16,848
- You stay here.
You let B.V. Handle it.

1572
01:16:16,849 --> 01:16:17,536
- No, I swear!

1573
01:16:17,537 --> 01:16:19,374
I got this.
I got this.

1574
01:16:19,375 --> 01:16:20,877
Oh, shit.

1575
01:16:20,878 --> 01:16:22,414
Whoa, hang on, hang on.

1576
01:16:22,415 --> 01:16:24,618
This is a--
it's a misunderstanding.

1577
01:16:24,619 --> 01:16:26,789
Amanda!

1578
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:28,794
- She's--
- Pain time.

1579
01:16:28,795 --> 01:16:30,898
Oh, wait a minute.
Wait, guys, guys!

1580
01:16:33,738 --> 01:16:34,939
Ow.

1581
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:36,878
Shit.

1582
01:16:38,181 --> 01:16:40,184
So you like messing
with the ladies?

1583
01:16:40,185 --> 01:16:42,021
You like
pushing 'em around?

1584
01:16:42,022 --> 01:16:45,295
That's fine.  But you don't
mess with B.V.'s girls.

1585
01:16:45,296 --> 01:16:47,834
Look, I really
am her uncle.

1586
01:16:47,835 --> 01:16:49,403
<i>Oh, yeah,
and I'm her daddy.</i>

1587
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:51,508
I outrank you.

1588
01:16:51,509 --> 01:16:54,815
So you tell B.V. that you're not
gonna mess with his girls no more

1589
01:16:54,816 --> 01:16:56,552
and we be cool.

1590
01:16:56,553 --> 01:16:59,024
This-- this has really
gotten way out of hand.

1591
01:16:59,025 --> 01:17:00,427
Huh?

1592
01:17:02,131 --> 01:17:05,304
Now, are you gonna mess
with B.V.'s girls?

1593
01:17:05,305 --> 01:17:08,811
No, I was-- I was just
trying to help her.

1594
01:17:08,812 --> 01:17:10,715
This fucker's got
to be deaf.

1595
01:17:10,716 --> 01:17:13,354
I'll give you anything
you want, huh?

1596
01:17:13,355 --> 01:17:15,425
<i>Get his attention
for me.</i>

1597
01:17:17,497 --> 01:17:20,336
Ah! Oh, fuck!

1598
01:17:23,944 --> 01:17:26,281
Are you gonna mess
with B.V.'s girls?

1599
01:17:26,282 --> 01:17:28,987
You broke
my fucking hand.

1600
01:17:28,988 --> 01:17:31,592
Okay, get his other hand
and get his leg too.

1601
01:17:31,593 --> 01:17:34,432
No.  No no, wait!
Wait wait, I have to type.

1602
01:17:34,433 --> 01:17:36,469
<i>- Wait, I'm a writer.
- You're a writer?</i>

1603
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:37,739
<i>- Yes.
- What you write?</i>

1604
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:39,910
<i>- A T.V. Show.
- Wait, hold hold hold hold.</i>

1605
01:17:39,911 --> 01:17:41,780
<i>- Which one?
- I'd rather not say.</i>

1606
01:17:41,781 --> 01:17:44,219
Oh, yeah?  And I'd rather
not kick your ass.

1607
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:47,358
- Which show?
- "Those MacAllister's."

1608
01:17:47,359 --> 01:17:50,031
"Those MacAllister's"?
No shit?  You write that?

1609
01:17:50,032 --> 01:17:52,770
When I had two
fuckin' hands, I did.

1610
01:17:52,771 --> 01:17:54,741
Wait, hold it, hold it.
No, hold on, hold on.

1611
01:17:54,742 --> 01:17:56,779
Come here, let me talk to
you for a minute.  No.

1612
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:58,483
Let me talk to you
for a minute.

1613
01:17:58,484 --> 01:18:00,720
You know, do you really
write that show?

1614
01:18:00,721 --> 01:18:02,324
- Yeah.
- Man, that shit is funny.

1615
01:18:02,325 --> 01:18:05,396
Man, I been thinking about getting
into the business, you know?

1616
01:18:05,397 --> 01:18:07,969
The television writing business?
Look, B.V.'s got this script.

1617
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:10,741
Maybe you could look at it
with B.V., and check it out?

1618
01:18:10,742 --> 01:18:13,748
Maybe make some suggestions?
Better yet, hire B.V. for your show?

1619
01:18:13,749 --> 01:18:14,395
- You're kidding.

1620
01:18:14,396 --> 01:18:16,521
- No, I been thinking about
gettin' out of this business.

1621
01:18:16,522 --> 01:18:18,324
I'm tired of all these
bitches and hoes, you know?

1622
01:18:18,325 --> 01:18:20,896
Too high-maintenance, man.
Stand up straight when I talk to you.

1623
01:18:20,897 --> 01:18:24,436
Look, I'm at a crossroad in my life.
I need a creative outlet.

1624
01:18:24,437 --> 01:18:27,510
Now, how many pages
should a script be?

1625
01:18:27,511 --> 01:18:30,383
For a standard half-hour
multi-camera?

1626
01:18:30,384 --> 01:18:31,920
- Yeah.
- About 44.

1627
01:18:31,921 --> 01:18:35,661
44?  Damn,
I only got seven.

1628
01:18:35,662 --> 01:18:38,200
Maybe, you know, you could take
it and add some stuff to it?

1629
01:18:38,201 --> 01:18:41,072
Like some pronouns, some
adverbs, some things like that?

1630
01:18:41,073 --> 01:18:42,742
Yeah, that'd be great.

1631
01:18:42,743 --> 01:18:44,412
Oh my God!
What happened?

1632
01:18:44,413 --> 01:18:46,282
Everything is good,
baby girl.

1633
01:18:46,283 --> 01:18:46,943
But you know what?

1634
01:18:46,944 --> 01:18:48,888
You should have told me that
this dude was your uncle.

1635
01:18:48,889 --> 01:18:50,692
It would have
changed everything.

1636
01:18:50,693 --> 01:18:52,529
You know, you need a ride
to the emergency room?

1637
01:18:52,530 --> 01:18:55,201
- No, I'm good.
- Well, you do well--

1638
01:18:55,202 --> 01:18:57,373
You stay on top of things.
I'll send you that script, okay?

1639
01:18:57,374 --> 01:18:59,777
- Oh, yeah, that'd be great.
- I'll deal with you later, all right?

1640
01:18:59,778 --> 01:19:02,149
- AMANDA: What?
- You guys knew that was her uncle?

1641
01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:04,788
<i>- No.
- Didn't hear Amanda mention that.</i>

1642
01:19:04,789 --> 01:19:06,559
You okay?

1643
01:19:08,062 --> 01:19:09,565
Where's my money?

1644
01:19:09,566 --> 01:19:13,506
You gave me $2,000.

1645
01:19:13,507 --> 01:19:16,613
Okay.  Okay.

1646
01:19:16,614 --> 01:19:19,619
You shouldn't have
come here.

1647
01:19:23,829 --> 01:19:25,666
I need to get
to a hospital.

1648
01:19:25,667 --> 01:19:28,271
Yeah, I'll drive you.

1649
01:19:28,272 --> 01:19:31,010
No no no. You've been
drinking. I'll drive.

1650
01:19:31,011 --> 01:19:33,081
You tell me
which way to go.

1651
01:19:38,393 --> 01:19:41,465
You missed the exit.

1652
01:19:41,466 --> 01:19:43,971
I said you missed
the exit.

1653
01:19:43,972 --> 01:19:46,576
I'm not losing
my wife

1654
01:19:46,577 --> 01:19:49,015
and getting
my hand broken

1655
01:19:49,016 --> 01:19:51,119
and getting kicked out
of a casino for nothing.

1656
01:19:52,957 --> 01:19:55,962
Somebody's gonna pay
for this and it's you.

1657
01:19:55,963 --> 01:19:57,967
You're going
to rehab.

1658
01:19:57,968 --> 01:19:59,738
No, I am not.

1659
01:19:59,739 --> 01:20:02,142
Look around, honey.
I think you are.

1660
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:05,148
- I'm getting out.
- Go ahead.

1661
01:20:05,149 --> 01:20:07,387
- I'm serious.
- Yeah, good, go ahead.

1662
01:20:07,388 --> 01:20:09,424
You want to kill
yourself anyway.

1663
01:20:09,425 --> 01:20:11,896
Yeah, come on,
hurry up.

1664
01:20:11,897 --> 01:20:13,433
- I'm gonna do it!
- Yeah, go ahead.

1665
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:16,606
I'll speed up. I want to
make sure you get killed.

1666
01:20:16,607 --> 01:20:19,512
Because believe me, sweetheart,
nobody wants a whore in a wheelchair.

1667
01:20:19,513 --> 01:20:21,784
- You fucking asshole!
- Go ahead, do it.

1668
01:20:23,822 --> 01:20:24,790
Ahh!

1669
01:20:33,643 --> 01:20:35,312
Ow.

1670
01:20:43,162 --> 01:20:45,900
<i>Hello?  Can you hear me?</i>

1671
01:20:45,901 --> 01:20:49,241
Hi. Um, yeah.
My uncle kidnapped me

1672
01:20:49,242 --> 01:20:52,649
and he's taking me
to rehab in Malibu.

1673
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:54,886
It's in California.

1674
01:20:54,887 --> 01:20:58,828
Um, I think it's called
Clark Baron or something.

1675
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:03,838
Can you please
pick me up?

1676
01:21:08,984 --> 01:21:11,020
I have to pull off.

1677
01:21:11,021 --> 01:21:14,127
I can't drive anymore.
My hand.

1678
01:21:14,128 --> 01:21:15,864
I'll drive.

1679
01:21:15,865 --> 01:21:17,802
I don't think so.

1680
01:21:31,197 --> 01:21:33,368
Here.
Take it.

1681
01:21:37,443 --> 01:21:38,879
Thanks.

1682
01:21:48,501 --> 01:21:50,404
I'm not doing rehab.

1683
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:52,608
As soon as you leave,
I'm out of there.

1684
01:21:52,609 --> 01:21:55,180
I'm just taking you there.
That's all I said I'd do.

1685
01:21:55,181 --> 01:21:58,253
What happens to you after
that, I don't give a shit.

1686
01:21:58,254 --> 01:22:02,228
If Greg ever sees you again,
he's gonna kick your ass so bad.

1687
01:22:02,229 --> 01:22:04,399
Oh, yeah.
Oh, he's wonderful.

1688
01:22:06,204 --> 01:22:08,408
You did real
well there, Amanda.

1689
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:13,151
You've made a lot of bad
choices in your short life,

1690
01:22:13,152 --> 01:22:15,890
but Greg
really stands out.

1691
01:22:20,033 --> 01:22:21,769
Greg loves me.

1692
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:24,408
<i>Stop buying him stuff.
See how much he loves you then.</i>

1693
01:22:31,390 --> 01:22:34,930
Someday, you're gonna see
what he's really like.

1694
01:22:34,931 --> 01:22:37,603
He'll do something
or say something

1695
01:22:37,604 --> 01:22:40,876
and it'll suddenly
be so clear to you

1696
01:22:40,877 --> 01:22:43,281
that your darling Greg

1697
01:22:43,282 --> 01:22:47,524
is a hateful, mouth-breathing,
abusive piece of shit.

1698
01:22:47,525 --> 01:22:50,630
Well, at least he's not
a 43-year-old drunk gambler.

1699
01:22:50,631 --> 01:22:53,402
No, that would
take talent.

1700
01:22:58,848 --> 01:23:00,451
You and me...

1701
01:23:02,189 --> 01:23:04,459
We live to make
bad choices.

1702
01:23:06,631 --> 01:23:10,805
We need a person
in our lives who--

1703
01:23:10,806 --> 01:23:13,979
who looks at us
when we fuck up and...

1704
01:23:16,385 --> 01:23:18,489
remembers who we were.

1705
01:23:19,558 --> 01:23:20,994
Who we could be.

1706
01:23:24,803 --> 01:23:27,441
You don't have someone like
that, all you have is you.

1707
01:23:29,079 --> 01:23:31,717
<i>And sooner or later,
left to your own</i>

1708
01:23:31,718 --> 01:23:34,990
brilliant,
damaged devices...

1709
01:23:37,897 --> 01:23:41,003
you just go spinning right
off the goddamn planet.

1710
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,516
You lose that person...

1711
01:23:50,490 --> 01:23:52,526
You're done.

1712
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:54,991
Oh my God!

1713
01:24:54,992 --> 01:24:57,864
Oh!  Oh ho ho ho!

1714
01:24:57,865 --> 01:25:01,071
Oh, thank you, God!

1715
01:25:11,894 --> 01:25:13,664
You're here.

1716
01:25:13,665 --> 01:25:15,501
It's free.

1717
01:25:15,502 --> 01:25:17,605
Give it a shot.

1718
01:25:19,745 --> 01:25:23,752
Let me actually think that
I'm doing something good.

1719
01:25:23,753 --> 01:25:28,128
If I can do one good thing,
maybe I can string a few together.

1720
01:25:30,634 --> 01:25:32,637
I'm glad this
is all about you.

1721
01:25:37,281 --> 01:25:39,652
You're better
than your life, Amanda.

1722
01:25:49,607 --> 01:25:52,145
You have a room with
a canyon view.

1723
01:26:42,552 --> 01:26:45,390
- Hi.
- Long fuckin' drive.

1724
01:26:45,391 --> 01:26:47,194
Now we gotta go
all the way back.

1725
01:26:47,195 --> 01:26:48,430
Aw.

1726
01:26:48,431 --> 01:26:50,201
Mmm, thanks for
coming, baby.

1727
01:26:52,106 --> 01:26:55,010
These glasses are crap.
Where'd you buy these?

1728
01:26:55,011 --> 01:26:58,351
You love me, don't you?

1729
01:26:58,352 --> 01:27:01,724
Like I really want to answer
stupid questions right now.

1730
01:27:07,638 --> 01:27:10,944
Did you have a girl
at the house last night?

1731
01:27:10,945 --> 01:27:12,614
No.

1732
01:27:12,615 --> 01:27:14,819
'Cause my uncle said
that he saw this girl--

1733
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:16,389
Would you shut up
about that guy?

1734
01:27:16,390 --> 01:27:18,159
He doesn't even know
what he's talking about.

1735
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:19,262
- No, Greg--
- Shut up!

1736
01:27:24,073 --> 01:27:26,377
You know, I don't even know
why we're sitting here talking.

1737
01:27:26,378 --> 01:27:28,381
I just want to
get the fuck home.

1738
01:27:28,382 --> 01:27:31,253
Don't ever hit me again.

1739
01:27:34,094 --> 01:27:35,763
Don't ever make me.

1740
01:28:00,315 --> 01:28:02,987
<i>Hi, we're not here. Leave a message.</i>

1741
01:28:02,988 --> 01:28:05,559
Oh, uh, Lorraine...

1742
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:08,131
Lorraine, pick up.

1743
01:28:08,132 --> 01:28:12,139
Hey, I just dropped Amanda
off at rehab.

1744
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:15,747
<i>- I thought you'd want to know...</i>

1745
01:28:15,748 --> 01:28:18,419
<i>Seriously, pull the fuck over right now!</i>

1746
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:21,158
I'm going, I'm going.
I'm jumping.

1747
01:28:21,159 --> 01:28:22,995
You're fucking crazy!

1748
01:28:22,996 --> 01:28:25,066
Jesus Christ.

1749
01:28:25,067 --> 01:28:26,903
I don't have fuckin' time
to play games, all right?

1750
01:28:26,904 --> 01:28:29,008
So get in the fuckin' car.
Get in the car.

1751
01:28:29,009 --> 01:28:30,478
Goodbye, Greg.

1752
01:28:30,479 --> 01:28:32,583
<i>Is this because
you made me hit you?</i>

1753
01:28:32,584 --> 01:28:34,920
<i>- Is that the problem?
- Goodbye, Greg.</i>

1754
01:28:34,921 --> 01:28:37,259
Gah!  It's over.
Fuck you.  We're done.

1755
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:40,332
That's right! And you know what?
I'm taking the fucking truck,

1756
01:28:40,333 --> 01:28:42,704
I'm taking my clothes,
I'm taking everything!

1757
01:28:42,705 --> 01:28:44,341
So fuck you!

1758
01:28:45,844 --> 01:28:48,449
Gah!

1759
01:28:48,450 --> 01:28:50,486
I need gas money.

1760
01:28:51,824 --> 01:28:53,860
Fuck you!  Bitch!

1761
01:29:26,831 --> 01:29:28,767
<i>Where you headed?
- I'm not sure yet.</i>

1762
01:29:28,768 --> 01:29:30,905
You better get in.

1763
01:29:35,282 --> 01:29:37,452
No, Dr. Franks
isn't here today.

1764
01:29:37,453 --> 01:29:39,557
Would you like to speak
with Dr. Baron?

1765
01:29:39,558 --> 01:29:42,329
I'll connect you.

1766
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:44,968
Hi.
Can I help you?

1767
01:29:44,969 --> 01:29:49,277
Yes.  You have a room
with a canyon view

1768
01:29:49,278 --> 01:29:50,914
for Amanda Keene?

1769
01:29:52,952 --> 01:29:55,423
Yes.
Is she here?

1770
01:29:57,161 --> 01:29:58,931
I'm her.

1771
01:30:07,049 --> 01:30:09,553
<i># there's everywhere else #</i>
