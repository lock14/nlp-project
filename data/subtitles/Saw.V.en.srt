1
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,346
Fuck. What the fuck?

2
00:01:40,426 --> 00:01:42,758
What the...? What the fuck?

3
00:01:46,664 --> 00:01:48,063
What the...?

4
00:01:49,435 --> 00:01:51,299
What the fuck!

5
00:01:51,503 --> 00:01:52,765
Fuck.

6
00:01:54,772 --> 00:01:56,206
Hello?

7
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:59,067
Fuck.

8
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,073
<i>Hello, Seth.</i>

9
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,616
<i>I wanna play a game.</i>

10
00:02:09,822 --> 00:02:12,016
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

11
00:02:12,223 --> 00:02:14,021
<i>- This is the same helplessness...</i>
- Help!

12
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:16,126
<i>... you've bestowed onto others.</i>

13
00:02:16,328 --> 00:02:18,353
<i>But now it's onto you.</i>

14
00:02:18,563 --> 00:02:22,329
<i>Some call this karma. I call it justice.</i>

15
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:24,502
<i>Now, you served five years...</i>

16
00:02:24,703 --> 00:02:27,694
<i>... of what should have been</i>
<i>a life sentence for murder.</i>

17
00:02:27,907 --> 00:02:29,966
<i>A technicality gave you freedom...</i>

18
00:02:30,175 --> 00:02:33,008
<i>... but it inhibited you</i>
<i>from understanding...</i>

19
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:35,203
<i>... the impact of taking a life.</i>

20
00:02:35,413 --> 00:02:38,348
<i>Today, I offer you true freedom.</i>

21
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:44,114
<i>In 30 seconds, the pendulum will drop</i>
<i>far enough to touch your body.</i>

22
00:02:44,323 --> 00:02:48,622
<i>Within sixty seconds</i>
<i>it will cut you in half.</i>

23
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:50,625
<i>To avoid the pendulum...</i>

24
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:54,697
<i>... all you have to do</i>
<i>is destroy the things that have killed.</i>

25
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,561
<i>Your hands.</i>

26
00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:00,068
<i>You must insert your hands</i>
<i>and push the buttons...</i>

27
00:03:00,271 --> 00:03:01,739
<i>... to start the devices before you.</i>

28
00:03:01,941 --> 00:03:04,501
<i>Your bones will be crushed to dust.</i>

29
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,736
<i>Will you destroy the things that have</i>
<i>taken life in order to save one, Seth?</i>

30
00:03:08,948 --> 00:03:10,039
<i>Make your choice.</i>

31
00:03:13,618 --> 00:03:15,086
No.

32
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:40,670
It was an accident!

33
00:03:46,384 --> 00:03:47,875
Please.

34
00:03:54,393 --> 00:03:55,417
Okay. Fuck you.

35
00:04:08,907 --> 00:04:11,774
Okay. Okay. Okay.

36
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,790
I did what I was supposed to do.

37
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:12,028
Let me see your hands.
Let me see your fucking hands.

38
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,459
Where is my daughter? You...

39
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,100
Jesus.

40
00:07:50,495 --> 00:07:52,189
<i>Hello, Agent Strahm.</i>

41
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:53,386
<i>If you're hearing this...</i>

42
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,158
<i>... then you've finally found</i>
<i>what you've been looking for.</i>

43
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:59,860
<i>But is the discovery</i>
<i>of my body enough?</i>

44
00:08:00,072 --> 00:08:03,701
<i>Or will your insatiable hunger</i>
<i>to uncover the truth...</i>

45
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:06,240
<i>... push you deeper into the abyss?</i>

46
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,846
<i>Heed my warning: Do not proceed.</i>

47
00:08:10,048 --> 00:08:15,680
<i>For this room can either be</i>
<i>your sanctuary or it can be your grave.</i>

48
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:17,983
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

49
00:08:20,858 --> 00:08:21,985
Fuck you.

50
00:09:28,126 --> 00:09:29,719
Hey!

51
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,155
Help!

52
00:09:33,432 --> 00:09:35,831
Help!

53
00:09:36,434 --> 00:09:39,028
Help!

54
00:09:54,253 --> 00:09:55,981
Help!

55
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,331
Go! Go!

56
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:27,201
You're okay.

57
00:11:33,918 --> 00:11:35,648
- Where's my dad?
- He's gonna be okay.

58
00:11:35,854 --> 00:11:38,481
Where's my mom?
Where's my mom?

59
00:11:38,691 --> 00:11:41,854
- Hoffman.
- I got it. I got it.

60
00:11:43,562 --> 00:11:45,153
You okay to walk?

61
00:11:45,364 --> 00:11:47,524
What the hell, man?
What happened? Where's Rigg?

62
00:11:49,134 --> 00:11:52,399
Tried to help. He didn't make it.

63
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,700
Nobody made it.

64
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:57,471
We got a live one.

65
00:12:38,082 --> 00:12:39,311
Hello?

66
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:41,014
Right away.

67
00:12:41,452 --> 00:12:42,976
Ms. Tuck.

68
00:12:43,355 --> 00:12:44,788
Have a seat.

69
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,126
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Feldman.

70
00:12:52,297 --> 00:12:53,423
Why am I here?

71
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:56,159
I represent your ex-husband, John.

72
00:12:56,368 --> 00:13:00,701
In the event of his death,
I was instructed to contact you.

73
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:05,774
You can understand my surprise
when I found out who he really was.

74
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:08,071
John left something for you.

75
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:34,671
<i>If you're watching this, Jill,</i>
<i>I'm long gone from this world.</i>

76
00:13:35,673 --> 00:13:40,941
<i>You are my heart, you always</i>
<i>have been. You always will be.</i>

77
00:13:42,181 --> 00:13:47,551
<i>I'm not going to try to explain</i>
<i>my actions of late.</i>

78
00:13:47,753 --> 00:13:52,052
<i>Suffice it to say that I find it difficult</i>
<i>to forgive myself...</i>

79
00:13:52,256 --> 00:13:53,884
<i>... for what happened at the clinic.</i>

80
00:13:54,625 --> 00:14:00,758
<i>I permitted, indeed, encouraged your</i>
<i>decisions regarding the people there.</i>

81
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:05,293
<i>I saw danger and l</i>...
<i>I should have acted sooner.</i>

82
00:14:05,504 --> 00:14:11,669
<i>I'm leaving you a box today, and</i>
<i>its contents are of grave importance.</i>

83
00:14:12,277 --> 00:14:15,735
<i>Even though you and I don't always see</i>
<i>eye to eye on everything...</i>

84
00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:19,405
<i>... I deeply believe in you</i>
<i>and I believe that you will know...</i>

85
00:14:19,618 --> 00:14:22,018
<i>... what to do with these materials.</i>

86
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:25,916
I wanna thank you all
for coming here today.

87
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:28,475
And I'd like to be the first to say...

88
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:31,655
...that the Jigsaw murders are over.

89
00:15:33,491 --> 00:15:37,258
The officers who gave their lives
are being honored here today.

90
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,754
But today I'd like to offer
a special honor...

91
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:44,332
...to the detective who's been
on this case right from the beginning...

92
00:15:44,536 --> 00:15:48,164
...who proved through hard work
and dedication...

93
00:15:48,373 --> 00:15:51,604
...that the people who died
did not die in vain.

94
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:56,110
Today we honor the newly promoted
Detective Lieutenant...

95
00:15:56,315 --> 00:15:58,374
...Mark Hoffman.

96
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,072
Congratulations.

97
00:16:00,284 --> 00:16:02,115
Thank you so much.

98
00:16:10,662 --> 00:16:12,220
Thank you. Thank you very much.

99
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:19,427
Throughout this ordeal,
if we've learned anything it's that...

100
00:16:19,638 --> 00:16:21,469
...human life is sacred.

101
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:25,366
And we've learned that every day...

102
00:16:26,577 --> 00:16:28,705
...life should be cherished.

103
00:16:29,581 --> 00:16:31,241
Justice...

104
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,510
...is the backbone
to every peaceful society.

105
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:39,918
And I believe that true justice
has been served.

106
00:17:45,557 --> 00:17:47,990
Detective Hoffman,
you're wanted at the hospital.

107
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,682
It's about Agent Perez.

108
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:51,624
Thank you.

109
00:17:55,333 --> 00:18:01,101
<i>Hello, Agent Perez, and welcome</i>
<i>to the world that you have long studied.</i>

110
00:18:01,306 --> 00:18:03,297
<i>Heed my warning, Agent Perez.</i>

111
00:18:03,508 --> 00:18:06,602
<i>Your next move is critical.</i>

112
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:08,608
<i>- Open the door.</i>
- What is that?

113
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:15,578
I got you.

114
00:18:37,275 --> 00:18:40,438
I'm truly sorry about Agent Perez.

115
00:18:42,547 --> 00:18:44,013
She said your name, you know.

116
00:18:45,616 --> 00:18:48,313
The last thing she said
was "Detective Hoffman."

117
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:51,750
Why'd she say that?
Why'd she say your name?

118
00:18:51,957 --> 00:18:54,152
- I don't know.
- No?

119
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,394
How'd you walk out of that building?

120
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:59,028
How did you?

121
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,529
On a gurney with a fucking hole
in my throat.

122
00:19:04,336 --> 00:19:05,394
Look at you.

123
00:19:05,804 --> 00:19:08,772
Couple of scratches and a story
about how your arm straps broke.

124
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:10,737
Jigsaw doesn't make mistakes.

125
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,536
Is this you theorizing again?
Because Jigsaw's dead.

126
00:19:13,744 --> 00:19:14,836
I'm not talking about him...

127
00:19:15,046 --> 00:19:17,570
...l'm talking about you
and your whole crooked department.

128
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,807
My department's gone. They're all dead.
There's no one left.

129
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:22,542
Besides you.

130
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:26,423
Been chasing Jigsaw
from the beginning...

131
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,525
...and I got him.

132
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:30,751
So unless you've got
something else to say...

133
00:19:31,496 --> 00:19:33,656
...back the fuck off.

134
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,733
Read the papers.
I saved that little girl.

135
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,808
Sorry about Agent Perez.

136
00:19:56,922 --> 00:19:58,913
Shouldn't you be resting?

137
00:19:59,857 --> 00:20:01,722
I'm fine, Erickson.

138
00:20:01,926 --> 00:20:05,294
No, you're not, Peter.
That's why I put you on medical leave.

139
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,963
I was supposed to die in that trap.

140
00:20:11,603 --> 00:20:14,127
You never should have been there
without backup.

141
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,103
I wanna talk to Jill Tuck one last time.

142
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:20,903
You're no longer handling
the case, Peter.

143
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:22,944
What?

144
00:20:23,147 --> 00:20:24,512
Read it.

145
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:29,816
Over a dozen dead bodies
were recovered at the scene...

146
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,113
...two of which were cops.

147
00:20:31,323 --> 00:20:34,849
Jigsaw's dead, how many lives
did I inevitably save?

148
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:37,186
By endangering yourself and others.

149
00:20:37,394 --> 00:20:38,555
You're off the case.

150
00:20:38,762 --> 00:20:40,491
On whose orders?

151
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:42,097
Mine.

152
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:46,001
I'm sorry, Peter. It's over.

153
00:22:25,369 --> 00:22:26,632
Oh, my God.

154
00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:34,976
- What is this?
- Hey, don't move.

155
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,079
What did you do to me?

156
00:22:37,281 --> 00:22:38,306
I didn't do anything.

157
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,376
- It's Jigsaw.
- What?

158
00:22:40,585 --> 00:22:43,986
I knew this was gonna happen to me.
This is what he does.

159
00:22:45,123 --> 00:22:46,646
No, it's not Jigsaw.

160
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,157
He's dead.

161
00:22:50,362 --> 00:22:52,592
Haven't you watched TV lately?

162
00:22:53,263 --> 00:22:54,924
Yeah, well, whoever it is...

163
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:56,758
...they're watching us.

164
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:03,269
To make sure we follow the rules.

165
00:23:03,474 --> 00:23:05,840
- Which are what?
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

166
00:23:06,044 --> 00:23:08,478
Unless you want your head
to pop off like a dandelion.

167
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,114
- How do you know that?
- Because I have eyes.

168
00:23:12,317 --> 00:23:14,785
One pull-pin starts the timer
for all of us.

169
00:23:16,587 --> 00:23:20,683
You won't wanna do that unless
you know how it works, now, would you?

170
00:23:21,226 --> 00:23:23,250
You're starting to freak me out, dude.

171
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:28,890
<i>Hello, and welcome.</i>

172
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:33,794
<i>From birth, you've all been given</i>
<i>the advantages of few others.</i>

173
00:23:34,005 --> 00:23:36,701
<i>Yet through poor moral decisions...</i>

174
00:23:36,907 --> 00:23:39,900
<i>... you've used these advantages</i>
<i>to selfishly further</i>...

175
00:23:40,111 --> 00:23:43,637
<i>... only yourselves</i>
<i>at the expense of others.</i>

176
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:47,545
<i>Well, today this singular way of thinking</i>
<i>will be put to the test.</i>

177
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:52,746
<i>Today, five will become one,</i>
<i>with a common goal of survival.</i>

178
00:23:52,957 --> 00:23:54,116
<i>You are all connected.</i>

179
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:56,691
<i>A cable runs through</i>
<i>your collar devices.</i>

180
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,556
<i>It can be pulled so tight...</i>

181
00:23:58,762 --> 00:24:01,596
<i>... that you will be decapitated</i>
<i>on the mounted razors.</i>

182
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:07,127
<i>The only way to remove the collar</i>
<i>is with the keys from the glass boxes...</i>

183
00:24:07,337 --> 00:24:08,827
<i>... on the pedestals before you.</i>

184
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,167
<i>However, if one of you moves</i>
<i>to retrieve a key...</i>

185
00:24:12,376 --> 00:24:15,710
<i>... the 60-second timer</i>
<i>will begin for you all.</i>

186
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,339
<i>In choosing how to react</i>
<i>to this situation...</i>

187
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:21,541
<i>... your lifelong instincts</i>
<i>will tell you to do one thing...</i>

188
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:24,881
<i>... but I implore you to do the opposite.</i>

189
00:24:26,124 --> 00:24:27,715
<i>Let the games begin.</i>

190
00:24:31,628 --> 00:24:33,596
Somebody has to die.

191
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:37,358
No, no, no, it says,
"Don't listen to your instincts."

192
00:24:37,568 --> 00:24:39,969
- That means don't go for the keys.
- You fucking nuts?

193
00:24:40,171 --> 00:24:42,105
How are we supposed to live
if we don't?

194
00:24:42,307 --> 00:24:44,570
- It's testing our endurance.
- We gotta move, babe.

195
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:46,767
That timer's connected to those jars.

196
00:24:46,978 --> 00:24:48,775
It didn't say anything
about those jars.

197
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,073
- They could be nothing.
- They're nail bombs.

198
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,215
Homemade, probably C-4.

199
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:55,009
How the fuck do you know that?

200
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,347
She's a fire inspector.
She's seen all kinds of demented shit.

201
00:24:58,556 --> 00:25:00,455
How do you know me?

202
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:05,751
Hey, man, she's asking you a question.
How do you know her?

203
00:25:08,665 --> 00:25:11,863
How do you know her? Answer me!

204
00:25:12,069 --> 00:25:14,299
Look, let's just keep our cool.

205
00:25:14,506 --> 00:25:17,669
- Okay, we can figure this out.
- We're all here for a reason.

206
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:21,401
Okay, and we're all connected,
as the message said.

207
00:25:21,613 --> 00:25:23,240
We just need to...

208
00:25:25,517 --> 00:25:28,486
- What did you do?
- You go first.

209
00:25:31,722 --> 00:25:34,782
It said that we were all born
with advantages.

210
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:37,294
Right? That means
we're all from money.

211
00:25:40,431 --> 00:25:41,954
- I'm not.
- And neither am I.

212
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,930
Hey, nice fucking try, Nancy Drew.

213
00:25:45,135 --> 00:25:46,932
Well, then, what does it mean?

214
00:25:47,137 --> 00:25:49,663
We did something wrong
with an advantage from birth.

215
00:25:49,874 --> 00:25:53,332
- That doesn't have to mean money.
- What are you not telling us?

216
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,836
You know about her, what do you know
about the rest of us?

217
00:25:57,048 --> 00:25:59,642
Would you fucking talk to me?

218
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:02,751
- Relax.
- I am fucking relaxed.

219
00:26:02,953 --> 00:26:05,148
It's a game, tweaker.

220
00:26:05,656 --> 00:26:09,855
Get it? The less you know about me,
the better.

221
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,996
The reason why you fucked up
your charmed existence...

222
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,461
...is pretty obvious to everyone, isn't it?

223
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:19,133
Fuck you. Fuck you.

224
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:21,531
Been playing with matches again,
have we?

225
00:26:22,173 --> 00:26:24,003
Fuck all of you and your fucking plan.

226
00:28:10,682 --> 00:28:13,241
Unless you wanna be shredded
when those bombs go off...

227
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,048
...I suggest we move on.

228
00:28:36,473 --> 00:28:37,963
What are you doing?

229
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:39,939
Being smart.

230
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,112
Special Agent Strahm's office.

231
00:28:51,322 --> 00:28:54,984
This is Detective Hoffman.
Is Agent Strahm available?

232
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:57,820
He's not, but I can connect you
to Special Agent Erickson.

233
00:28:58,028 --> 00:28:59,519
He's handling all inquiries.

234
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,096
Please.

235
00:29:03,233 --> 00:29:05,634
<i>You've reached the voice mail box</i>
<i>of Agent Erickson.</i>

236
00:29:05,836 --> 00:29:07,895
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

237
00:29:08,105 --> 00:29:10,574
Yeah, this is Detective Hoffman.

238
00:29:10,775 --> 00:29:13,242
I needed to discuss something
with Agent Strahm...

239
00:29:13,443 --> 00:29:15,308
...but I can't seem to track him down.

240
00:29:15,512 --> 00:29:18,880
Could you give me a call?
It would be greatly appreciated.

241
00:30:19,176 --> 00:30:21,337
There you are.

242
00:31:08,893 --> 00:31:11,019
Sister.

243
00:31:41,424 --> 00:31:42,789
Peter.

244
00:31:45,563 --> 00:31:48,726
- Cowan, take this to analysis.
- Right away, sir.

245
00:31:50,835 --> 00:31:52,063
What are you doing here?

246
00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:56,707
Just grabbing some stuff from the office.
I'm taking your advice.

247
00:31:57,642 --> 00:32:02,135
- Taking some time off, huh?
- Yeah, well, I have to heal up, you know.

248
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,807
You know, I'll keep in touch.
I'll see you around.

249
00:33:36,106 --> 00:33:37,539
Hoffman.

250
00:33:37,741 --> 00:33:41,439
We got another body.
Looks like another Jigsaw victim.

251
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:44,842
- You up for this?
- Yeah.

252
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,383
Typical bio. Murder convict.

253
00:33:47,585 --> 00:33:50,109
Served five years,
just released last month.

254
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,181
I know him.

255
00:33:55,558 --> 00:33:57,788
His name's Seth Baxter.

256
00:33:58,295 --> 00:34:00,593
My sister's ex-boyfriend.

257
00:34:02,032 --> 00:34:04,523
This is the guy
that murdered your sister?

258
00:34:04,734 --> 00:34:09,728
He was sentenced to 25 years.
Got it reduced to five on a technicality.

259
00:34:11,307 --> 00:34:13,798
Well, then I'd say justice was served.

260
00:34:23,621 --> 00:34:27,648
You killed him.
Made it look like a Jigsaw trap.

261
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,922
I got you.

262
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:38,092
Not yet.

263
00:34:38,335 --> 00:34:40,496
Don't close the door.
It'll set off the timer.

264
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:43,172
- Do you know that for sure?
- Educated guess.

265
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,568
What we need to do
is figure out who everyone is.

266
00:34:45,777 --> 00:34:49,304
Okay, well, we know that the dead
woman worked for the fire department.

267
00:34:49,514 --> 00:34:51,880
Not anymore.
She got canned a month ago.

268
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:54,516
How the fuck do you...?
How the fuck do you know that?

269
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,552
You're responsible for this?
She had her fucking head cut off!

270
00:34:57,755 --> 00:34:58,847
I'm closing the door.

271
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:01,650
- I'm gonna close the fucking door!
- Just be quiet.

272
00:35:03,094 --> 00:35:04,686
Please.

273
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,025
What's your story?

274
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,224
I work for
the Department of City Planning.

275
00:35:12,436 --> 00:35:16,601
- Married? Kids?
- No, and no. Your turn.

276
00:35:16,807 --> 00:35:19,503
You're not gonna tell them
about Daddy?

277
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:26,880
- My dad is Richard Gibbs.
- The owner of the Cougars?

278
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:31,351
He's been trying to build a new stadium
for years. Little did he know...

279
00:35:31,556 --> 00:35:36,891
...all he had to do is wait for his daughter
to get a job in City Planning.

280
00:35:38,195 --> 00:35:40,721
And you. What about you?

281
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:43,126
What sort of shady shit
have you been up to?

282
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:46,201
I'm a senior V.P.
for a real estate development company.

283
00:35:46,403 --> 00:35:47,802
So you're boring too.

284
00:35:50,507 --> 00:35:54,170
The Marshvard Group. Yeah,
you can't get a permit in this town...

285
00:35:54,378 --> 00:35:57,505
...without going through
the Department of City Planning.

286
00:35:57,715 --> 00:36:00,342
- Right?
- No, you can't.

287
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,108
What about you?

288
00:36:04,054 --> 00:36:05,715
No wife.

289
00:36:05,922 --> 00:36:11,623
- No kids that I know of. No job.
- Trust-fund baby. Anyone surprised?

290
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:14,126
I'm so fucking sick of
your self-righteousness.

291
00:36:14,331 --> 00:36:15,458
It's your turn.

292
00:36:15,666 --> 00:36:20,467
I'm an investigative journalist
for <i>The Herald.</i>

293
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:24,106
<i>Herald?</i> That's your accomplishment?
You work for a gossip rag?

294
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,105
Bite your fucking tongue.

295
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,800
What the hell are in those jars?

296
00:36:29,914 --> 00:36:33,371
Let's do this fucking thing
before the bombs go off.

297
00:36:40,123 --> 00:36:40,987
Fuck!

298
00:36:42,527 --> 00:36:45,393
<i>Hello, and welcome to the next lesson.</i>

299
00:36:45,597 --> 00:36:48,690
<i>These walls hold four chambers.</i>

300
00:36:50,568 --> 00:36:52,297
<i>These chambers are for safety.</i>

301
00:36:52,503 --> 00:36:55,300
<i>However, to access them,</i>
<i>a key is needed.</i>

302
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:59,032
<i>But only three of the keys</i>
<i>will fit the locks.</i>

303
00:36:59,242 --> 00:37:02,974
<i>These keys are in the glass jars</i>
<i>hanging from the ceiling.</i>

304
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:06,275
<i>Move quickly, though,</i>
<i>because when the clock ticks down...</i>

305
00:37:06,483 --> 00:37:11,148
<i>... the explosives in the corners</i>
<i>of the room will detonate.</i>

306
00:37:11,356 --> 00:37:16,054
<i>With only three points of safety,</i>
<i>which of you will be the odd man out?</i>

307
00:37:16,827 --> 00:37:18,385
<i>Make your choice.</i>

308
00:37:21,632 --> 00:37:22,759
Fuck.

309
00:37:29,641 --> 00:37:32,405
Fuck, it's blank. I need a shape.

310
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,746
Get your hands off that,
you're not going anywhere.

311
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:42,751
- Stop it!
- Get a clue, you fucking bitch.

312
00:37:42,954 --> 00:37:44,945
It's survival of the fittest.

313
00:38:00,338 --> 00:38:02,067
Blank.

314
00:38:03,273 --> 00:38:04,639
Blank.

315
00:38:07,945 --> 00:38:09,378
Shit.

316
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:12,072
I got it. Got it.

317
00:38:24,128 --> 00:38:25,992
Yes.

318
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:35,570
Better luck next time, rich boy.

319
00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:39,438
Survival of the fittest, my ass!

320
00:38:53,324 --> 00:38:54,655
Wait.

321
00:39:18,882 --> 00:39:21,851
Everything all right with
Detective Kerr in the Seth Baxter case?

322
00:39:22,052 --> 00:39:23,110
- Yeah.
- Good.

323
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,153
Fisk. You keep me posted.

324
00:39:26,356 --> 00:39:28,882
- Will do.
- Good.

325
00:39:29,092 --> 00:39:33,791
After Seth,
you were involved in every investigation.

326
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:44,300
When did you first meet Jigsaw?

327
00:40:48,773 --> 00:40:51,003
Stop it, stop it!

328
00:41:01,786 --> 00:41:03,184
Don't!

329
00:41:07,925 --> 00:41:10,985
Heel! Heel, I said!

330
00:41:11,195 --> 00:41:13,059
Don't provoke him. Asshole!

331
00:41:14,164 --> 00:41:17,293
Jesus Christ.
Come on, Peewee. Come on.

332
00:41:17,501 --> 00:41:19,833
- Come on, Peewee.
- Peewee.

333
00:41:20,036 --> 00:41:21,402
Shit.

334
00:41:25,509 --> 00:41:27,568
Do you mind?

335
00:41:33,885 --> 00:41:35,943
- Going up?
- Yes, thank you.

336
00:41:57,208 --> 00:41:59,266
What floor are you going to?

337
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:12,916
I think we're both going
to the same place.

338
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,456
You know why you're here, don't you?

339
00:42:49,659 --> 00:42:54,063
They say imitation
is the sincerest form of flattery.

340
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,333
But I find it somewhat distasteful...

341
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:02,335
...to be given credit for work
that's not mine.

342
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:10,338
Especially inferior work.

343
00:43:15,186 --> 00:43:18,746
Like you,
I know what it's like to lose family.

344
00:43:20,224 --> 00:43:23,556
I know what it's like
not to be able to protect loved ones.

345
00:43:24,527 --> 00:43:27,121
It's a powerless feeling.

346
00:43:32,335 --> 00:43:33,461
I wouldn't do that.

347
00:43:39,677 --> 00:43:41,041
Hair trigger.

348
00:43:43,914 --> 00:43:45,778
What do you see?

349
00:43:49,487 --> 00:43:52,512
Vengeance can change a person.
Make you into something...

350
00:43:52,722 --> 00:43:55,623
...you never thought
you were capable of being.

351
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,661
But unlike you, I've never killed anyone.

352
00:44:00,864 --> 00:44:04,164
- I give people a chance.
- You call this a chance?

353
00:44:04,367 --> 00:44:06,233
We'll see.

354
00:44:07,438 --> 00:44:12,465
- Our game's just begun.
- Our game? You don't even know me.

355
00:44:14,612 --> 00:44:19,344
I know you.
I've followed you as you've pursued me.

356
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:22,610
I know you. I know about your sister.

357
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:25,253
I know how you cared for her.

358
00:44:31,728 --> 00:44:33,628
I know she was your only family.

359
00:44:33,864 --> 00:44:35,695
Leave me alone.

360
00:44:39,235 --> 00:44:40,601
No!

361
00:44:48,278 --> 00:44:52,306
You sit in bars until closing.
You drink so you can sleep.

362
00:44:52,516 --> 00:44:53,983
You stagger to your car...

363
00:44:54,184 --> 00:44:58,246
...and then you start it all over again
the next day.

364
00:45:01,659 --> 00:45:05,059
Then I discovered
what you do for recreation.

365
00:45:11,601 --> 00:45:13,331
You can dispense justice...

366
00:45:13,536 --> 00:45:17,530
...and give people a chance
to value their lives in the same moment.

367
00:45:19,309 --> 00:45:21,106
And by the way...

368
00:45:21,878 --> 00:45:24,403
...the blade on your pendulum
was inferior.

369
00:45:25,916 --> 00:45:28,782
If you want a true edge...

370
00:45:31,822 --> 00:45:34,016
...you have to used tempered steel.

371
00:45:34,224 --> 00:45:37,193
Tempering's better for the long haul.

372
00:45:37,393 --> 00:45:39,385
You in this for the long haul, detective?

373
00:45:40,998 --> 00:45:44,161
I've been a cop for 20 years.
Is that long enough for you?

374
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:48,394
Then you and I both know the statistics
for repeat offenders in this city.

375
00:45:48,606 --> 00:45:53,668
67.5 percent of criminals
are back in prison within three years.

376
00:45:53,878 --> 00:45:55,367
What do you want from me?

377
00:45:55,945 --> 00:45:59,541
So you might look at what you did
to Seth as a kind of public service.

378
00:46:01,284 --> 00:46:04,378
She was my only family.
He didn't deserve a chance.

379
00:46:04,621 --> 00:46:07,181
- He was an animal.
- Everybody deserves a chance!

380
00:46:07,391 --> 00:46:09,291
You didn't see the blood!

381
00:46:09,492 --> 00:46:11,688
You didn't see
what he fucking did to her!

382
00:46:11,896 --> 00:46:15,262
Killing is distasteful...

383
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:18,358
...to me.

384
00:46:21,472 --> 00:46:25,601
There is a better, more efficient way.

385
00:46:33,617 --> 00:46:36,210
What do you see...? Look!

386
00:46:36,653 --> 00:46:39,851
- What do you see?
- Tell me what you want.

387
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:46,228
I wanna know if you have
what it takes to survive.

388
00:47:05,782 --> 00:47:07,842
Fuck you.

389
00:47:08,052 --> 00:47:09,313
Fuck you.

390
00:47:11,322 --> 00:47:13,847
You see, it's a different method
that I'm talking about.

391
00:47:14,557 --> 00:47:16,492
If a subject survives my method...

392
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,429
...he or she is instantly rehabilitated.

393
00:47:21,565 --> 00:47:23,590
Now, you want a chance?

394
00:47:25,068 --> 00:47:26,695
You want a chance?

395
00:47:26,903 --> 00:47:28,030
I'll give you a chance.

396
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,505
I'm the man you call Jigsaw.

397
00:47:41,251 --> 00:47:43,413
It's your duty to bring me in...

398
00:47:43,621 --> 00:47:46,317
...but I know who you are...

399
00:47:46,523 --> 00:47:48,990
...and I know what you've done.

400
00:47:52,896 --> 00:47:54,295
So this is blackmail.

401
00:47:54,498 --> 00:47:55,556
No, no, no.

402
00:47:57,001 --> 00:47:59,231
This is redemption.

403
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:06,331
Just giving you an option, that's all.

404
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:09,510
Now, you can arrest me...

405
00:48:09,713 --> 00:48:13,809
...but doing so,
your life ends as you know it.

406
00:48:14,018 --> 00:48:15,315
Or...

407
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:16,918
...you could explore...

408
00:48:18,188 --> 00:48:20,519
...a method of rehabilitation...

409
00:48:20,724 --> 00:48:23,056
...that'll permit you to sleep at night.

410
00:48:44,815 --> 00:48:46,373
Or I could kill you right now.

411
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:48,949
But you're not a true killer.

412
00:48:49,952 --> 00:48:51,181
That's your dilemma...

413
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:54,846
...and the information that I have on you
is exactly where it needs to be...

414
00:48:55,059 --> 00:48:59,155
...and it will be released
in the event of my disappearance.

415
00:48:59,929 --> 00:49:02,454
They'll never believe your word
over mine.

416
00:49:04,967 --> 00:49:07,061
You willing to take that risk?

417
00:49:07,271 --> 00:49:09,364
Risk of ruining your own life...

418
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:12,007
...in order to protect
a corrupt legal system...

419
00:49:12,208 --> 00:49:15,735
...that puts murderers
back on the streets?

420
00:49:21,485 --> 00:49:23,543
How would your sister feel?

421
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:25,778
You're at a crossroads, detective.

422
00:49:26,556 --> 00:49:28,650
Make your choice.

423
00:49:50,681 --> 00:49:53,114
Did you help Jigsaw get all of them?

424
00:50:40,297 --> 00:50:43,994
<i>Detective Hoffman,</i>
<i>this is Special Agent Erickson.</i>

425
00:50:44,001 --> 00:50:47,630
You had something you needed
to discuss about the Jigsaw case?

426
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:50,864
Yes. I stopped by Agent Strahm's room
tonight at the hospital...

427
00:50:51,074 --> 00:50:52,166
...but he wasn't there.

428
00:50:52,376 --> 00:50:54,570
<i>- I hope he's all right.</i>
- Oh, yeah, he's fine.

429
00:50:54,778 --> 00:50:57,144
Agent Strahm was theorizing
about the possibility...

430
00:50:57,347 --> 00:51:00,579
...of an additional accomplice
to Jigsaw, other than Amanda Young.

431
00:51:01,418 --> 00:51:04,286
<i>Someone who might be</i>
<i>currently unknown.</i>

432
00:51:04,487 --> 00:51:07,217
<i>Did he ever mention</i>
<i>anything like that to you?</i>

433
00:51:07,425 --> 00:51:10,485
- No, but then again, I'm new to the case.
<i>- Yeah, well...</i>

434
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:13,423
...maybe you could get him to
contact me at his earliest convenience.

435
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:15,963
Will do. And...

436
00:51:16,166 --> 00:51:18,260
...in your theorizing...

437
00:51:18,469 --> 00:51:20,960
...who exactly did you suspect
would be an accomplice?

438
00:51:22,706 --> 00:51:25,139
Well, he suspected
someone on the inside.

439
00:51:25,376 --> 00:51:26,570
<i>Someone with access.</i>

440
00:51:26,777 --> 00:51:29,007
It's an interesting theory.

441
00:51:29,213 --> 00:51:32,478
Detective, what do you say we reconnect
in the morning?

442
00:51:32,983 --> 00:51:34,507
You got it.

443
00:52:17,961 --> 00:52:19,259
Dead.

444
00:52:19,463 --> 00:52:22,262
That guy was an asshole,
but he was smart.

445
00:52:22,467 --> 00:52:23,525
We could've used him.

446
00:52:24,068 --> 00:52:26,434
Yeah, well, someone had to die.

447
00:52:28,505 --> 00:52:30,599
Would you rather it'd been you?

448
00:53:29,666 --> 00:53:31,224
How'd they get you?

449
00:54:42,472 --> 00:54:43,804
Screw you!

450
00:54:44,442 --> 00:54:47,706
I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you!

451
00:54:53,918 --> 00:54:56,181
I'm gonna kill...

452
00:55:38,929 --> 00:55:40,954
<i>Hello, Paul.</i>

453
00:55:41,164 --> 00:55:44,190
<i>Did you cut yourself</i>
<i>because you truly wanted to die...</i>

454
00:55:44,402 --> 00:55:48,099
<i>... or did you just want some attention?</i>

455
00:55:48,306 --> 00:55:49,932
<i>Tonight, you'll show me.</i>

456
00:55:50,141 --> 00:55:54,237
<i>If you want to live,</i>
<i>you'll have to cut yourself again.</i>

457
00:55:55,746 --> 00:55:59,681
<i>How much blood will you shed</i>
<i>to stay alive, Paul?</i>

458
00:56:50,266 --> 00:56:53,235
I didn't expect to feel any remorse.

459
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:55,771
The heart cannot be involved.

460
00:56:55,972 --> 00:56:59,067
Emotionally, there can be nothing there.

461
00:56:59,275 --> 00:57:01,903
It can never be personal.

462
00:57:02,313 --> 00:57:04,679
- Let's go.
- No.

463
00:57:04,882 --> 00:57:06,940
You're not done yet.

464
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:12,213
Tonight you will see the difference
between killing and rehabilitation.

465
00:57:24,568 --> 00:57:28,231
There is another detective
that you should be aware of.

466
00:57:28,438 --> 00:57:30,030
His name's Tapp.

467
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,641
He's smart, and he's getting closer.

468
00:57:32,842 --> 00:57:34,936
I know who he is.

469
00:57:38,849 --> 00:57:42,215
I need you to lead him
to someone for me.

470
00:57:44,487 --> 00:57:46,387
A doctor.

471
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:50,684
A healer who needs some healing.

472
00:57:54,498 --> 00:57:56,829
Is this yours, doctor?

473
00:58:04,375 --> 00:58:07,833
You supplied these police files,
didn't you?

474
00:58:39,643 --> 00:58:42,907
You're assuming this is gonna play out
the way you want it.

475
00:58:43,114 --> 00:58:45,172
I assume nothing.

476
00:58:49,887 --> 00:58:55,586
I anticipate the possibilities,
and I let the game play out.

477
00:58:56,126 --> 00:58:58,960
Then why do you need Amanda
in the game?

478
00:59:01,699 --> 00:59:04,793
To ensure that the rules are followed.

479
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:10,197
She won't make decisions for anyone.
She'll just...

480
00:59:11,474 --> 00:59:13,601
...offer choices.

481
00:59:15,545 --> 00:59:17,672
Little to your left.

482
00:59:25,556 --> 00:59:27,887
That leaves a lot to chance.

483
00:59:42,873 --> 00:59:46,706
If you're good
at anticipating the human mind...

484
00:59:52,315 --> 00:59:55,114
...it leaves nothing to chance.

485
01:00:08,231 --> 01:00:09,824
It's time.

486
01:00:27,684 --> 01:00:30,085
Jesus Christ.

487
01:00:34,891 --> 01:00:37,485
Great. More bombs.

488
01:00:41,231 --> 01:00:44,030
All right. What'd you do to get here?

489
01:00:44,235 --> 01:00:48,797
l... I did something,
and a bunch of people were killed.

490
01:00:49,005 --> 01:00:50,597
I didn't mean to.

491
01:00:51,541 --> 01:00:54,032
They're still dead.

492
01:00:54,244 --> 01:00:56,076
- That's why you're here?
- Yeah.

493
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,248
Shouldn't you have
gone to jail for something like that?

494
01:00:59,449 --> 01:01:01,509
Nobody else knows.

495
01:01:06,056 --> 01:01:07,420
Somebody does.

496
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,869
I didn't kill anybody,
if that's what you're asking.

497
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:21,367
I wasn't.

498
01:01:22,905 --> 01:01:24,965
I grant building permits.

499
01:01:27,945 --> 01:01:31,072
And yeah, some people might have been
more deserving than others...

500
01:01:31,282 --> 01:01:33,273
...but you know what?
That's the business.

501
01:01:33,483 --> 01:01:36,213
So if someone tells you different,
then they're just stupid.

502
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:38,911
Or naive. Or both.

503
01:01:39,123 --> 01:01:40,248
Bullshit.

504
01:01:40,456 --> 01:01:44,393
You take bribes. You're a fucking liar.
You cheat people. That's not nice.

505
01:01:44,594 --> 01:01:46,119
Yeah, well.

506
01:01:46,329 --> 01:01:49,697
I'm sure she's not exactly
Mother Teresa either.

507
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,527
No, I'm not.

508
01:01:52,436 --> 01:01:56,030
I build condos in one of the most
densely populated cities in the country.

509
01:01:56,239 --> 01:01:59,766
You don't put up a new building
without tearing down a few old ones.

510
01:01:59,976 --> 01:02:03,572
So we're all bags of shit that deserve
to be here. That's good. That's great.

511
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:04,769
Fucking great.

512
01:02:04,981 --> 01:02:07,280
So is that what you think this is?

513
01:02:07,483 --> 01:02:09,509
You don't think there's
any other connection?

514
01:02:09,719 --> 01:02:11,516
No, I do.

515
01:02:11,722 --> 01:02:14,019
I do. And I don't give a shit.

516
01:02:14,224 --> 01:02:17,284
Close the fucking door.
We have to hear the rules.

517
01:02:28,438 --> 01:02:29,871
<i>Hello, and welcome.</i>

518
01:02:30,074 --> 01:02:35,603
<i>You must all be eager to learn the next</i>
<i>important lesson in your transformation.</i>

519
01:02:35,813 --> 01:02:40,512
<i>The game before you is designed</i>
<i>to bridge the gap between you all.</i>

520
01:02:40,717 --> 01:02:44,347
<i>In order to open the five locks</i>
<i>on the door out of this room...</i>

521
01:02:44,554 --> 01:02:48,286
<i>... the five electrical circuits</i>
<i>powering them must be closed.</i>

522
01:02:48,492 --> 01:02:49,958
<i>The only way to do this...</i>

523
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:55,222
<i>... is to find a way to connect</i>
<i>all five cords to the bath water.</i>

524
01:02:55,431 --> 01:02:58,559
<i>Close the circuits</i>
<i>and the door will open.</i>

525
01:02:58,768 --> 01:03:00,030
<i>But you must work quickly...</i>

526
01:03:00,237 --> 01:03:03,728
<i>... for in three minutes, an electrical</i>
<i>current will surge through this room...</i>

527
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:06,637
<i>... locking the door forever.</i>

528
01:03:06,844 --> 01:03:11,076
<i>Who will bridge the gap?</i>
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

529
01:03:14,251 --> 01:03:15,842
Jesus Christ.

530
01:03:21,224 --> 01:03:23,750
It's not gonna reach.
How the fuck are we gonna do this?

531
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,851
Come on!

532
01:03:27,864 --> 01:03:29,856
You're gonna get in the tub...

533
01:03:30,534 --> 01:03:32,934
...and we're gonna connect
the five cords to you.

534
01:03:33,137 --> 01:03:34,501
But you're gonna kill me too.

535
01:03:36,706 --> 01:03:37,673
Get in.

536
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:40,672
Yeah, I'm more of a shower guy.
I don't think I'm gonna do that right now.

537
01:03:40,878 --> 01:03:42,539
Get in the fucking tub.

538
01:03:42,746 --> 01:03:45,237
Fuck you, you bitch.
You get in the fucking tub.

539
01:03:46,817 --> 01:03:48,284
No, don't do it.

540
01:03:48,485 --> 01:03:50,146
Please, no.

541
01:04:00,831 --> 01:04:03,891
You killed her.
You fucking killed her.

542
01:04:04,101 --> 01:04:05,965
I didn't trust her.

543
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:08,764
Jesus Christ. What is it with you two?

544
01:04:08,972 --> 01:04:11,440
Just shut up and help me with the body.

545
01:04:28,592 --> 01:04:32,152
Hey, hey. No.
Don't let your body touch hers.

546
01:05:00,224 --> 01:05:02,317
Oh, my God, it's a hook.

547
01:05:05,695 --> 01:05:08,324
Stick it in her head or we don't get out.

548
01:05:11,335 --> 01:05:13,268
Just do it.

549
01:05:33,523 --> 01:05:35,014
Come in.

550
01:05:36,626 --> 01:05:39,391
Sir. It's Jill Tuck.

551
01:05:39,596 --> 01:05:41,188
Good evening.

552
01:05:41,398 --> 01:05:42,523
Special Agent Erickson.

553
01:05:42,733 --> 01:05:44,666
Thank you for seeing me
so late in the day.

554
01:05:44,867 --> 01:05:45,994
Not a problem.

555
01:05:46,202 --> 01:05:47,760
That'll be all.

556
01:05:49,273 --> 01:05:51,797
Please, have a seat.

557
01:05:53,076 --> 01:05:56,534
So, what do you need from us?

558
01:05:57,179 --> 01:05:59,375
I think I'm being followed.

559
01:05:59,583 --> 01:06:01,914
Well, that sounds more like
police work, Miss Tuck.

560
01:06:03,619 --> 01:06:05,746
I don't think they can help me.

561
01:06:05,956 --> 01:06:09,858
- Because?
- Because it's you. The FBI.

562
01:06:11,762 --> 01:06:13,228
I don't understand.

563
01:06:13,429 --> 01:06:16,695
It started when John was first identified
as the Jigsaw killer.

564
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:19,561
It didn't surprise me then,
but I'm still being followed.

565
01:06:19,769 --> 01:06:23,228
By who, Miss Tuck?
Who would be following you?

566
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,431
I think it's the agent
who interrogated me.

567
01:06:26,543 --> 01:06:27,840
Agent Strahm.

568
01:06:29,579 --> 01:06:32,913
- And why would he be following you?
- I don't know.

569
01:06:37,853 --> 01:06:41,085
- Who else have you told about this?
- Only you.

570
01:07:06,617 --> 01:07:08,608
What's going on with Amanda?

571
01:07:08,818 --> 01:07:12,447
Didn't you tell me the only way
to truly offer enlightenment...

572
01:07:12,956 --> 01:07:14,753
...is by detaching emotionally?

573
01:07:18,327 --> 01:07:21,092
But you can have something
Amanda doesn't.

574
01:07:21,664 --> 01:07:23,599
Anonymity.

575
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:27,496
That's the greatest protection.
That's what I've given you.

576
01:07:28,137 --> 01:07:30,766
I need you to set up a game...

577
01:07:31,708 --> 01:07:35,405
...that may not be entirely clear to you
right now.

578
01:07:36,646 --> 01:07:39,240
But I assure you that
the people being tested...

579
01:07:40,384 --> 01:07:43,181
...are part of something much larger.

580
01:07:43,653 --> 01:07:45,349
They're connected.

581
01:07:45,554 --> 01:07:51,356
So in the end,
all the pieces will fit together...

582
01:07:53,463 --> 01:07:55,521
...and it'll be clear.

583
01:07:59,603 --> 01:08:03,039
- Amanda will fail you.
- We'll see.

584
01:08:03,907 --> 01:08:06,431
What are you doing?

585
01:08:12,715 --> 01:08:16,207
- What's this?
- It's time to play a game.

586
01:08:18,255 --> 01:08:19,586
Help.

587
01:08:19,789 --> 01:08:21,654
Help me. What is this?

588
01:08:21,858 --> 01:08:23,984
What is this? Please.

589
01:08:25,895 --> 01:08:31,333
Why are you keeping me here?
What is this place? What is this place?

590
01:09:03,899 --> 01:09:06,595
We were all supposed to die.

591
01:09:10,573 --> 01:09:13,270
He's just fucking testing you.

592
01:09:13,476 --> 01:09:15,069
Where is my daughter?

593
01:09:18,481 --> 01:09:20,346
Help!

594
01:09:20,783 --> 01:09:22,479
He didn't make it.

595
01:09:22,985 --> 01:09:24,817
Nobody made it.

596
01:09:25,122 --> 01:09:27,180
You were supposed to be the hero.

597
01:10:05,862 --> 01:10:07,853
Peter, where the hell are you?

598
01:10:10,567 --> 01:10:12,125
Hello?

599
01:10:22,045 --> 01:10:24,979
<i>You've reached the voice mail</i>
<i>for Special Agent Peter Strahm.</i>

600
01:10:25,181 --> 01:10:26,944
<i>Leave a message.</i>

601
01:10:29,853 --> 01:10:33,413
Cowan. I wanna put a locator
on Strahm's mobile phone.

602
01:10:34,256 --> 01:10:35,849
Right away, sir.

603
01:10:36,059 --> 01:10:37,548
Call me right back.

604
01:10:37,761 --> 01:10:39,284
Right.

605
01:11:39,789 --> 01:11:43,055
- What the hell is that?
- It's our next nightmare.

606
01:11:49,231 --> 01:11:51,564
There are blades in here.

607
01:11:56,006 --> 01:11:57,974
It's connected to the door.

608
01:11:58,175 --> 01:12:00,369
When the beaker fills up,
the door opens.

609
01:12:03,279 --> 01:12:05,180
Fills with what?

610
01:12:06,149 --> 01:12:09,778
Blood. Our blood.

611
01:12:10,686 --> 01:12:15,680
I think an arm is supposed to go in there
to fill the beaker.

612
01:12:16,225 --> 01:12:19,092
Wait. Why can't we just use
the water from the other room?

613
01:12:19,328 --> 01:12:20,454
No, the slots are closed.

614
01:12:20,663 --> 01:12:23,757
We have to stick our arm in to
keep them open, but they'd get stuck.

615
01:12:23,966 --> 01:12:25,729
We need to close that door.

616
01:12:27,369 --> 01:12:28,837
So, what?

617
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:34,671
We fight to the death, and one gets to
freedom with the other person's blood?

618
01:12:40,149 --> 01:12:41,310
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

619
01:12:41,518 --> 01:12:43,679
Do you still have the keys
from that first room?

620
01:12:43,886 --> 01:12:46,117
- Yeah.
- Try one of them on that door.

621
01:12:46,323 --> 01:12:49,417
- It won't work.
- No, it might. This one has a keyhole.

622
01:12:54,396 --> 01:12:56,796
It... It's not even the same lock.

623
01:13:00,203 --> 01:13:02,296
Wait, why are there five slots
in this machine?

624
01:13:03,006 --> 01:13:04,997
Shouldn't there only be one?

625
01:13:11,981 --> 01:13:13,949
They all would have worked.

626
01:13:39,176 --> 01:13:40,234
There you are, Strahm.

627
01:13:41,278 --> 01:13:44,212
All right. I got him.

628
01:13:51,887 --> 01:13:54,048
I don't think this is a good idea.

629
01:13:54,256 --> 01:13:56,315
The tub wasn't meant for one person.

630
01:13:56,525 --> 01:13:58,426
We were supposed to hold
one cable each...

631
01:13:58,627 --> 01:14:00,960
...and suffer a small shock.

632
01:14:01,363 --> 01:14:02,729
It was meant for five people.

633
01:14:02,932 --> 01:14:05,162
They all were. Every game.

634
01:14:05,368 --> 01:14:07,836
We only needed one key
in the first room.

635
01:14:08,037 --> 01:14:11,632
They all worked, and any one of them
would have opened every collar.

636
01:14:12,141 --> 01:14:16,043
In the second room, the three tubes were
large enough for more than one person.

637
01:14:16,246 --> 01:14:19,271
We were supposed to work together
so we all survived.

638
01:14:19,481 --> 01:14:21,109
That's the game.

639
01:14:21,318 --> 01:14:23,411
Your instincts will tell you to do
one thing...

640
01:14:23,619 --> 01:14:25,679
...but I implore you to do the opposite.

641
01:14:25,889 --> 01:14:27,378
Oh, God.

642
01:14:27,591 --> 01:14:30,492
Yeah. Big fucking whoops.

643
01:14:45,609 --> 01:14:47,235
<i>Hello, and welcome.</i>

644
01:14:47,444 --> 01:14:49,274
<i>This journey</i>
<i>has been one of discovery...</i>

645
01:14:49,479 --> 01:14:51,573
<i>... and hopefully you've discovered</i>
<i>that the whole...</i>

646
01:14:51,782 --> 01:14:53,750
<i>... is greater than the sum of its parts.</i>

647
01:14:54,484 --> 01:14:58,444
<i>The human body, for instance,</i>
<i>is an astoundingly durable creation.</i>

648
01:14:58,655 --> 01:15:01,386
<i>It contains approximately 10 pints</i>
<i>of blood...</i>

649
01:15:01,591 --> 01:15:05,551
<i>... yet it is still able to operate</i>
<i>with just half of that.</i>

650
01:15:05,762 --> 01:15:08,458
<i>The device before you is</i>
<i>one of sacrifice.</i>

651
01:15:08,666 --> 01:15:10,132
<i>A sacrifice of blood.</i>

652
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:14,770
<i>In order to open the door, the beaker</i>
<i>must be filled to the marked level...</i>

653
01:15:14,971 --> 01:15:18,305
<i>... a level that is of no coincidence.</i>

654
01:15:18,509 --> 01:15:20,738
<i>This amount can come</i>
<i>from any one of you.</i>

655
01:15:20,944 --> 01:15:24,435
<i>That does not matter.</i>
<i>What does matter is time.</i>

656
01:15:24,648 --> 01:15:27,310
<i>For in 15 minutes,</i>
<i>if the beaker is not filled...</i>

657
01:15:27,518 --> 01:15:31,750
<i>... the bombs will explode</i>
<i>and the doors will be sealed forever.</i>

658
01:15:31,954 --> 01:15:36,789
<i>So now I ask you, how much blood</i>
<i>will you give in order to survive?</i>

659
01:15:42,899 --> 01:15:44,492
Fuck! Fuck.

660
01:15:45,168 --> 01:15:50,435
All right, so one person can fill the
beaker with ten pints of blood and die.

661
01:15:50,673 --> 01:15:52,608
Or two people can fill it...

662
01:15:52,810 --> 01:15:54,801
...with five pints...

663
01:15:55,011 --> 01:15:57,070
...and maybe live.

664
01:15:58,515 --> 01:15:59,743
What are we gonna do?

665
01:16:31,948 --> 01:16:33,176
I lied.

666
01:16:34,717 --> 01:16:37,743
I know the investigative journalist
in there. His name is Charles.

667
01:16:37,954 --> 01:16:40,548
He was writing a story about what I did.

668
01:16:41,824 --> 01:16:43,622
What'd you do?

669
01:16:45,496 --> 01:16:47,622
A dealer gave me...

670
01:16:47,831 --> 01:16:51,163
...an ounce of heroin to burn down
an abandoned building.

671
01:16:51,368 --> 01:16:52,356
But it wa...

672
01:16:52,569 --> 01:16:55,595
Oh, God. It wasn't abandoned.
There was eight people in there.

673
01:16:55,805 --> 01:16:59,172
Eight people died.

674
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:02,945
And the feds got involved.

675
01:17:03,146 --> 01:17:05,774
And I got caught but I made a deal
and my dad got me off.

676
01:17:05,983 --> 01:17:09,282
The guy who hired me disappeared and
nothing happened. Nothing happened.

677
01:17:36,279 --> 01:17:38,180
That's how she knew me.

678
01:17:38,381 --> 01:17:40,577
The woman in the tub.

679
01:17:41,318 --> 01:17:43,684
The fire. It's what connects us.

680
01:17:44,488 --> 01:17:47,615
The fire inspector who wrote
the bogus accident report...

681
01:17:47,824 --> 01:17:51,761
...the city planner who pushed through
the residential permits...

682
01:17:52,162 --> 01:17:55,689
...the journalist that buried
the investigative story...

683
01:17:55,899 --> 01:17:58,833
...the rich-kid junkie
who was the patsy...

684
01:17:59,036 --> 01:18:01,936
...and the real estate developer
who set it all in motion.

685
01:18:02,605 --> 01:18:06,837
We killed eight people and stole
the property, and nobody cared.

686
01:18:07,677 --> 01:18:08,702
Nobody cared?

687
01:18:09,279 --> 01:18:11,908
Eight people and their families cared.

688
01:18:12,115 --> 01:18:15,744
The feds cared. Look at my fucking arm.
I cared! I cared!

689
01:18:16,487 --> 01:18:17,886
But you didn't face justice.

690
01:18:18,488 --> 01:18:19,512
None of us did.

691
01:18:19,722 --> 01:18:21,917
Why did they all do it?

692
01:18:22,126 --> 01:18:23,217
Why? Was it for money?

693
01:18:24,161 --> 01:18:26,595
This was your plan?
You were the one behind it?

694
01:18:27,497 --> 01:18:29,431
There was eight people
in that building.

695
01:18:29,632 --> 01:18:31,600
You had to know that.
Did you know that?

696
01:18:33,037 --> 01:18:34,470
You're a monster.

697
01:18:39,076 --> 01:18:40,372
So are you.

698
01:18:41,211 --> 01:18:44,078
We both deserve to be here.

699
01:19:37,033 --> 01:19:39,662
I can't do this alone. Look at me.
I can't do this alone.

700
01:19:39,869 --> 01:19:40,927
Okay. It's okay.

701
01:20:06,396 --> 01:20:07,625
We have to go on three.

702
01:20:26,082 --> 01:20:27,072
One.

703
01:20:35,158 --> 01:20:37,024
Two.

704
01:20:40,863 --> 01:20:43,024
Put your hand in the hole!

705
01:20:51,442 --> 01:20:53,033
Three!

706
01:22:22,231 --> 01:22:23,596
<i>Hello, Agent Strahm.</i>

707
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,829
<i>If you are hearing this...</i>

708
01:22:26,036 --> 01:22:28,800
<i>... then you have once again</i>
<i>found what you're looking for.</i>

709
01:22:29,006 --> 01:22:30,371
<i>Or so you think.</i>

710
01:22:30,573 --> 01:22:33,407
<i>Your dedication is to be commended.</i>

711
01:22:33,609 --> 01:22:38,239
<i>But I ask you if you have learned</i>
<i>anything on your journey of discovery.</i>

712
01:22:38,448 --> 01:22:40,279
<i>As the old adage goes:</i>

713
01:22:40,484 --> 01:22:45,944
<i>"Fool me once, shame on you.</i>
<i>Fool me twice, shame on me. "</i>

714
01:22:46,456 --> 01:22:50,586
<i>The situation you find yourself in</i>
<i>is one of trust.</i>

715
01:22:50,793 --> 01:22:55,230
<i>So I ask you, Special Agent Strahm,</i>
<i>have you learned to trust me?</i>

716
01:22:55,431 --> 01:23:00,698
<i>The only way to survive this room</i>
<i>is by entering the glass box before you.</i>

717
01:23:00,904 --> 01:23:05,898
<i>Pain will be incurred,</i>
<i>but you have a chance of survival.</i>

718
01:23:33,970 --> 01:23:35,029
We did it.

719
01:23:35,238 --> 01:23:36,569
We won.

720
01:23:36,773 --> 01:23:38,364
We won.

721
01:25:26,682 --> 01:25:29,207
I got you, you motherfucker.

722
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:52,502
Drop it!

723
01:25:52,708 --> 01:25:54,676
I said drop it!

724
01:26:01,118 --> 01:26:02,779
Who did this to you?

725
01:26:02,985 --> 01:26:04,247
Who did this to you?

726
01:26:06,856 --> 01:26:07,845
We won.

727
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:10,086
We won.

728
01:26:10,292 --> 01:26:12,556
We worked together.

729
01:26:23,073 --> 01:26:27,805
I need immediate medical assistance.
1293 Sandburst Drive.

730
01:27:08,051 --> 01:27:10,076
Jesus, Peter.

731
01:27:26,903 --> 01:27:28,631
Tell me how to open it.

732
01:27:29,072 --> 01:27:30,060
How do I open it?

733
01:27:42,685 --> 01:27:46,417
<i>However, if you choose not to,</i>
<i>you will never be heard from again.</i>

734
01:27:46,622 --> 01:27:48,783
<i>Your body will never be found.</i>

735
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:50,823
<i>You will simply vanish.</i>

736
01:27:51,694 --> 01:27:57,530
<i>I ask you, Special Agent Strahm,</i>
<i>have you learned enough to trust me?</i>

737
01:27:57,734 --> 01:27:59,429
<i>Will you heed my warning?</i>

738
01:27:59,636 --> 01:28:01,536
<i>- For if you do not...</i>
- Fuck you.

739
01:28:01,738 --> 01:28:04,069
<i>... this room will forever be your tomb.</i>

740
01:28:04,274 --> 01:28:07,333
<i>And my legacy will become yours.</i>

741
01:28:07,778 --> 01:28:10,372
If you're good at anticipating
the human mind...

742
01:28:10,581 --> 01:28:13,175
- I think I'm being followed.
- Who would be following you?

743
01:28:13,382 --> 01:28:15,715
I wanna talk to Jill Tuck one last time.

744
01:28:15,918 --> 01:28:18,113
He suspected someone on the inside.

745
01:28:20,524 --> 01:28:22,822
...it leaves nothing to chance.

746
01:28:26,262 --> 01:28:27,890
We were all supposed to die.

747
01:28:29,233 --> 01:28:30,859
You were supposed to be the hero.

748
01:28:34,570 --> 01:28:35,970
<i>Make your choice.</i>

749
01:28:40,844 --> 01:28:42,333
Cowan.

750
01:28:42,546 --> 01:28:43,739
Yeah, this is Erickson.

751
01:28:43,947 --> 01:28:46,313
I want you to put out an APB.

752
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:49,514
Suspect's name is Peter Strahm.

753
01:28:49,987 --> 01:28:51,648
Yeah, that's right.

754
01:28:51,854 --> 01:28:53,845
Special Agent Peter Strahm.

755
01:29:16,279 --> 01:29:18,713
I'm gonna stop you, you son of a bitch.

756
01:29:22,085 --> 01:29:24,917
I know who you are. I know.
