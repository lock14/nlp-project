1
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,330
I haven't seen any wildlife yet.

2
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:24,459
We could be in downtown Pittsburgh,
for all I know.

3
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,794
Dad, how are you holding up?

4
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,630
I'm fine, I'm fine,

5
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,799
except for you asking me every
two minutes how I'm holding up.

6
00:01:32,508 --> 00:01:33,927
Sorry, honey.

7
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:35,678
I'm hot.

8
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,973
How much further do we...

9
00:01:39,515 --> 00:01:41,476
Jesus, take that thing
out of my face!

10
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,147
Sorry, Dad doesn't like cameras unless
he's got his trench coat over his face.

11
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,733
How's the old man doing?

12
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,986
Heart rate slightly elevated,
blood pressure normal.

13
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,990
I got $100 says Travis
taps his daughter tonight.

14
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,283
Sucker bet.

15
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,411
You might want to record
over the last bit.

16
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,582
When are we gonna see something?

17
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,418
What?

18
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,754
If you don't talk,
you might hear something.

19
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,297
Hear what?

20
00:02:14,842 --> 00:02:16,344
All right, everyone, get ready!

21
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:19,555
Remember, your weapons
won't fire until mine does,

22
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,307
so be patient!

23
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:30,066
What the...?

24
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,652
Wait for my command!

25
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,574
Dad, how are you...

26
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,452
Sorry!

27
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,502
Whatever happens,
do not step off of the path.

28
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,129
Thank you for sharing.

29
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,552
Oh, my God!

30
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,431
Cute, isn't he?

31
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:10,607
You don't see that in downtown
Pittsburgh, do you Mr. Wallenbeck?

32
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,865
Shoot, for Christ's sake!

33
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,242
Heart rate elevated.

34
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,039
- Shoot it!
- Wait.

35
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,005
Hold it.

36
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,719
- Not yet!
- Are you crazy?

37
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,304
Shoot it!

38
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,683
Now!

39
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,020
Anything to say, Mr. Wallenbeck?

40
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,953
Gentlemen and lady.

41
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,999
Today you stood shoulder-to-shoulder
with Columbus discovering America,

42
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,711
Armstrong stepping on the moon,
Brubaker landing on Mars.

43
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:55,795
You are true pioneers

44
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:59,173
on the very last frontier:
Time.

45
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,343
On behalf of us all at Time Safari,
Incorporated,

46
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:06,306
I congratulate you
on a truly thrilling hunt.

47
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,349
I'm proud to know you.

48
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,351
I have to say,

49
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,605
of all the jumps I've seen,

50
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:17,650
your group's was by far
the most courageous and skillful.

51
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:21,029
I was scared out of my mind.
My heart's still pounding.

52
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:24,532
That's a nominal physiological
reaction to the jump.

53
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,827
Your heart rate will slow
as we gain distance from the event

54
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,246
and adrenaline flow
is reduced.

55
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,539
What?

56
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,041
It is.

57
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,049
Can I ask you something, Mr. Hatton?

58
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,676
Of course.
Anything at all.

59
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,471
Where's Travis Ryer?

60
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,536
- You look like you could use a drink.
- Nope.

61
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,413
You're a government inspector.

62
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,041
- You're supposed to drink on the job.
- I don't drink.

63
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,752
Then this is the best
you'll feel all day.

64
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,130
- I hate these jumps, is all.
- Picked the right line of work.

65
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,841
Biding my time.
Couple more years, I'll be out.

66
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,928
Civil Service pays you guys
enough to retire early?

67
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,348
Have a good night.

68
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,727
This is the clearest reading of
molecular blood structure

69
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,146
<i>- we've ever had.
- You are correct, Dr. Ryer.</i>

70
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,731
I'm getting closer and you know it.

71
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,359
<i>- Yes, Dr. Ryer.
- Contain your enthusiasm.</i>

72
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,320
<i>My function is to facilitate
the operation of Time Safari,</i>

73
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,656
<i>not your private research.
On that subject,</i>

74
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:50,201
<i>will you be filing your report
on today's jump tonight</i>

75
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,412
<i>or at the last possible moment
tomorrow, as usual?</i>

76
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,289
<i>- Nobody likes a nag.
- Reminding is not nagging.</i>

77
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,291
You've got an answer for everything.

78
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,710
<i>I have to.
I was extremely expensive.</i>

79
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,420
It's not always a good quality.

80
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,171
<i>I understand, Dr. Ryer.</i>

81
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,048
So don't have the last word.

82
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,175
<i>- I won't, Dr. Ryer.
- You did it.</i>

83
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,219
<i>- I'm sorry, Dr. Ryer.
- You did it again.</i>

84
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,930
Anything going on between you two
that I should know about?

85
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,725
<i>- Good evening, Mr. Hatton.
- Hello, TAMI.</i>

86
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,852
The guests are asking for you.

87
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,146
I'll be finished in a few minutes.

88
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,774
When I say guests,
it's a euphemism. I mean clients,

89
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,860
as in "people who pay. "

90
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,321
If I remember correctly,
clients keep us waiting,

91
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,615
not the other way around.

92
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:29,907
I'm almost done.

93
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:34,579
I don't think
you're catching my drift.

94
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,334
You work here so you can study

95
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,628
your silly animals
who don't exist anymore.

96
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,297
I work here so I can grow
rich and fat

97
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,300
and own everything
that does happen to exist.

98
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:51,054
I hired you because
you're this big deal scientist

99
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:54,140
and clients pay more for a big deal
anything, it makes them feel important.

100
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:57,185
Rotten, I know.
But progress is a rotten business,

101
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,854
which is why you have to go
out there and mingle with them.

102
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:03,524
They pay, you study, I get rich.
Is this a great country, or what?

103
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:08,112
Did I mention you signed
a contract and you have to do this?

104
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,031
I don't remember if I did.

105
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,120
Oh, my speech was that good?

106
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,206
Or were you done anyway?

107
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,005
A safari suit, boots, helmet

108
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,258
and a holo-disc to relive the jump.

109
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,719
Take an especially close look
at this disc,

110
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,179
- Mr. Wallenbeck.
- Why's that?

111
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,389
Well...

112
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,601
I can't be certain
until I review it myself,

113
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,896
but I'm pretty sure
your shot brought him down.

114
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,818
Well, yeah.

115
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,709
Security!

116
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,754
A toast to all of you big,
brave hunters!

117
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,298
Congratulations!

118
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,011
What's the matter?

119
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,888
You want to shoot dinosaurs,
you're afraid of a little blood?

120
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,100
You don't understand
the danger of what you're doing!

121
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,228
You keep messing with the past,
one day you'll ruin the future!

122
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,897
You should know better!

123
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,859
Are you so stupid
you can't see you're being used?

124
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,282
Well, that was fun.

125
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,702
Harder and harder to get good waiters.

126
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,679
- What was she yelling about?
- The usual:

127
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,390
Time jumps
will destroy the world. Crackpot.

128
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:03,686
A century ago she would have been
screaming about the Internet or biotech.

129
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:07,231
Some people are afraid of progress.
She's a dinosaur herself.

130
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,859
Let her yell all she wants.

131
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,320
Don't let her spoil the party.

132
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,785
I'm fine!

133
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:22,038
- I prefer walking on my own, thanks.
- Guys, whoa! Hold on.

134
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,624
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

135
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,253
Tell me what that was all about.

136
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,798
You don't have a clue what you're doing.
You'll destroy everything!

137
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,385
Lady, no offense, but I think
I'm qualified to offer an opinion.

138
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,470
I work with TAMI. I lead the jumps.

139
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,514
You're the one who's clueless.

140
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,724
- You're Travis Ryer?
- That's right.

141
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,977
Mr. Ryer, there's a lot
about TAMI you don't know.

142
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,604
- It's Dr. Ryer.
- Dr. Ryer.

143
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,440
One of the many things
you don't know is that I'm Sonia Rand.

144
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,859
I invented TAMI, you asshole.

145
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,530
Excuse me!

146
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,365
Miss, wait up a second.

147
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,035
There are seven credited names
on TAMI's patent.

148
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,121
I don't recall
a Dr. Rand being one of them.

149
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,249
- I don't have time for stupid people.
- Make some time.

150
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,918
And stop with the insults.
It gets on my nerves.

151
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,921
Do you think I'd devote
my career to designing

152
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,382
an amusement park ride
for rich men with little willies

153
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,259
to shoot prehistoric animals?

154
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,303
I think if you were a guy

155
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,930
someone would have knocked you
on your ass a long time ago.

156
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,182
So shoot me.

157
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,060
If you oppose TAMI's use,
why build her

158
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,938
- in the first place?
- I built her because I'm a scientist.

159
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:32,942
Possibilities drive us. What they said
was impossible, I knew could be done.

160
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,528
I applied for a research grant
with a company called CJN Co.

161
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,781
They handed out money
and left me alone.

162
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,326
Your actual dream come true,
until I finished developing TAMI.

163
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,036
Then why haven't I heard of you?

164
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,789
I'm a nerd, not a lawyer. Turns out
there was a clause in my contract.

165
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,834
CJN Co. Owned the patent on whatever
I developed with their money.

166
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,419
Guess who controls the company?

167
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,671
- Charles Hatton.
- Very good.

168
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,924
It seems I signed
a non-disclosure agreement,

169
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,760
so Hatton removed my name and,

170
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,637
except for tonight, shut me up.

171
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,765
I get upset watching you people
destroy the world with my dream.

172
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,601
That can piss someone off.
What's your excuse?

173
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:07,936
You really want to know?

174
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,492
I'm getting close,

175
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,204
- really close.
- Close to what?

176
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,333
Look carefully.
Tell me what you think it is.

177
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,793
A DNA strand of some kind.

178
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:35,255
- Can you tell what kind?
- No, I got a D in Biology.

179
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,387
His ancestor.

180
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,808
When I was a little boy,
my grandfather used to tell me stories

181
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,103
about actually seeing
real animals in the wild.

182
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,189
Imagine seeing him run free.

183
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,818
The last wild animal born
out of captivity was a crocodile.

184
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,820
She died 38 years ago.

185
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,989
Then the poachers started
hitting the zoos and the virus

186
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,658
took care of the rest.
Millions of years of evolution,

187
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,785
and we kill them off
in a few thousand...

188
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,955
and screw up their DNA.
We can't even clone them.

189
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,873
- He was beautiful.
- That's why I do this job.

190
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,669
When we go on a hunt we obviously
can't take physical samples,

191
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,839
but I've created a way
to take remote DNA readings.

192
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,133
I can only do it in bits,
but the bits add up.

193
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,844
One day, I'll reconstruct
the DNA from animals

194
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,971
that lived long before the virus.

195
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:27,682
I can bring them back.

196
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,143
Saving animals by killing them,
that makes sense.

197
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,937
The animals we hunt have to be
in the last seconds of their life

198
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,939
so we don't upset
the course of history.

199
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,983
That allosaurus is shot cleanly,

200
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,235
seconds before
he gets bogged down in a swamp

201
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,030
5 minutes before
a volcano erupts and fries him

202
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,906
in hot lava.

203
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,118
I wish people would pay
for a photo safari

204
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,579
instead of a hunting safari.

205
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,581
But they don't.
There's no other way.

206
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,376
So you bring rich tourists back
to the past o jeopardize the future.

207
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,296
I appreciate
what you're trying to accomplish.

208
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,423
But it's dangerous. This is bigger

209
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,842
than what you
or anyone else is working on.

210
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,802
It's bulletproof.

211
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,804
A new government agency
is assigned to us.

212
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,557
They check our protocols up,
down, and sideways.

213
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,267
That's how Hatton
got the green light.

214
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,978
You don't have a clue about
Charles Hatton! It's about money.

215
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,940
It's always the same
when there's so much of it involved.

216
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,650
But this is different.

217
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,527
You are messing
with the whole of evolution.

218
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,946
Nothing is bulletproof.

219
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,823
It must have been amazing.

220
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:28,993
God help us.

221
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,629
Hey, pal, you break it,
you bought it.

222
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:40,713
Sorry.

223
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,182
Whoa, what's that?

224
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,351
The molecular structure
of allosaurus blood.

225
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,560
No way.

226
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:55,728
Cool.

227
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,219
The doorman let me in.

228
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,807
I told him I was
your cousin from St. Louis.

229
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,853
I always did like Aunt Martha.

230
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:52,410
I'm afraid I've killed it.
Or at least driven it to suicide.

231
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,037
Got a bit of a brown thumb.

232
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:59,626
- Maybe a little sunlight will help.
- You just moved in?

233
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:03,254
No, I've been here
for about two years.

234
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,298
Okay.

235
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:17,310
Chloe thinks I'm going to a farm.

236
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,311
What's that about?

237
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,188
My wife told her I was
going to sow some wild oats.

238
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,191
Adorable. Little kids are adorable.

239
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,818
Could you say that
with less enthusiasm?

240
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,655
I'm not fond of adorable.
I rate it just below perky.

241
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,157
It's nice you have a family.

242
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,493
Without families,
what would we do with Christmas?

243
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,912
Me? I run my company
and that's about it.

244
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,956
Your kids will grow up.

245
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,291
My company will be
acquired by somebody. So what?

246
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,627
We're sleepwalking through life.

247
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,338
Admit it or not,
we're bored out of our minds.

248
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,048
I'm not bored out of my mind.

249
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:49,717
What's the last exciting thing you did?

250
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,761
- Play fetch with your dog?
- I don't know...

251
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,597
Come on! This'll arouse
the old, dormant male instinct.

252
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,225
- Make us feel alive.
- It's awfully expensive.

253
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,352
Why be rich if we don't buy things

254
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,104
other people can't afford?

255
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,156
George, how's life?

256
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,951
I can't complain.
If I did, who would listen?

257
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,328
Tell me about it. Oh, could you...

258
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,789
- I'll get a cab for your cousin.
- Thanks.

259
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,423
Standard liability release forms.

260
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,509
- That's a lot of forms.
- There's a lot of liability.

261
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,886
We take you back
65 million years to hunt

262
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,639
the greatest predator
the world has ever seen.

263
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:39,309
We are the first
and only people able to do this.

264
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:43,438
We use technology that wasn't
even a dream a few years ago.

265
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,065
A new federal agency,
the Department of Temporal Regulation,

266
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:47,817
was created for us.

267
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,987
This is not a game.
There is no reset button.

268
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,614
Today, on this hunt...

269
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:54,240
someone will die.

270
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:55,950
The prey... or the hunters.

271
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,163
There is no middle ground.
Imprint where indicated.

272
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,168
By the way,
deposits are non-refundable.

273
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,714
- Sure we should do this?
- There's a 6-year waiting list.

274
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:12,383
We paid double to cut
to the head of the line

275
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,218
and you want to slink home?

276
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,305
You want to spend the rest of your life
with balls the size of BBs?

277
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:21,935
What the hell!

278
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:25,104
They're so big
I can hear 'em clanging.

279
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,904
How was the other night
with the lovely Ms. Wallenbeck?

280
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,282
- It's none of your business.
- He said defensively.

281
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,910
If you must know, I sent her home.

282
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,078
Before or after?

283
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,789
Sometimes you can be a real brat.

284
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,711
Jen, I promised your father
that I would always look after you.

285
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,546
- Are you going to lecture me?
- No, I just...

286
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,925
Good, because Jeffrey
and I only went out for...

287
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,385
Who is Jeffrey?

288
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,845
- You don't know?
- No. Who is he?

289
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,556
I thought you were talking
about Jeffrey.

290
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,684
What exactly did you and Jeffrey do?

291
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,727
- Nothing.
- Tell me now.

292
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,437
Not going to happen.

293
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,277
What were you going to say just now?

294
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,405
I don't know.

295
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:18,574
I know we're sure
about what we're doing...

296
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:19,742
Yeah, and?

297
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:20,952
But maybe...

298
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:22,620
Maybe what?

299
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,707
I don't know. It's nothing.

300
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:41,472
Derris, what do you do
when you're not spying

301
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:45,226
for the government on us?
You got a family? Wife?

302
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,978
Significant other?

303
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,271
Goldfish?

304
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,065
No, you probably
go crazy at home, right?

305
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:55,403
Lampshade on your head,
chicken feet, whips.

306
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:56,988
I know it.

307
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,615
Everyone,

308
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,702
this is Mr. Middleton

309
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,787
and Mr. Eckles.

310
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,749
Gentlemen, this is your jump team.

311
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,753
Jennifer Krase will record
the holo-disc of your hunt.

312
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,756
Marcus Payne is your jump technician.

313
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,635
Dr. Lucas keeps
everyone ticking. And this...

314
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,971
is Dr. Travis Ryer.

315
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,514
You must be Mr. Eckles.

316
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,475
It's an honor to meet you, Dr. Ryer.

317
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,727
You're half the reason
my wife let me do this.

318
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:30,438
- What's the other half?
- He has a huge insurance policy.

319
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:32,774
Mr. Middleton.

320
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:37,070
It's nice to have clients who look
like they know what they're doing.

321
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,322
I have a good feeling about this jump.

322
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,866
You're in for the ride of your life.

323
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,993
We have developed technology

324
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:46,287
that is absolute cutting edge.

325
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:50,208
Actually, it was developed for us
by a Dr. Sonia Rand.

326
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,542
Isn't that correct?

327
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:59,717
Gentlemen, your weapons are
laser designated.

328
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:03,972
They're gauss rifles. They fire
frozen liquid nitrogen bullets

329
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:06,891
- that completely dissolve in 2 minutes.
- Wait a minute.

330
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,935
We'll take down a dinosaur with ice?

331
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:21,239
Second rule of time jumping:
Don't leave anything behind.

332
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:33,334
Not another.
I'm getting track marks.

333
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,671
The third rule of time jumping:
Don't bring anything back.

334
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:39,007
What's rule number one?

335
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:42,343
No matter how small, never change

336
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,804
anything in the past. Nothing.

337
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:48,600
You kill a bee, then maybe the flower
it was going to pollinate doesn't grow

338
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,603
and its seeds don't get spread

339
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:54,314
and the animal that was going to

340
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,441
eat the vegetation can't,
and it dies,

341
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,860
and it was carrying genes
for a new kind

342
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,820
of animal that doesn't occur

343
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:04,616
and it alters the course of evolution.
A single bee.

344
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:08,912
The farther back,
the more catastrophic changes could be.

345
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,080
So, rule number one?

346
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:12,457
Don't change anything.

347
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,627
Hey. Brass balls, remember?

348
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,939
Everyone, visors down.

349
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,363
This is a com check.
Everyone hearing me okay?

350
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,239
- Ryer, check.
- Krase, check.

351
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,408
- Derris, check.
- Lucas, check.

352
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:48,534
Check.

353
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:51,537
Tell him you can hear him.

354
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,499
Okay, follow me.

355
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:19,649
Hands to your side.

356
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:33,371
Oh my God, it's so tight.
I can't move.

357
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:35,123
Why so tight?

358
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,625
We are going to enter
the virtual receiver.

359
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:41,421
You've got to stay still or the particle
beam will not hit the right spot.

360
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,548
You want all those atoms winding up

361
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,092
in the same place
and as the same people.

362
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:00,440
If you feel disoriented,

363
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:03,318
concentrate on your heartbeat,
it'll calm you down.

364
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:07,196
And whatever you do,
don't look into the light!

365
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:08,156
What?

366
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,409
Just kidding.
This is supposed to be fun.

367
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,746
Let's go get him!

368
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:00,500
- Everyone okay?
- Yeah, we're both fine.

369
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,586
Remember, don't touch anything.

370
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:24,482
- Something up, Mr. Eckles?
- My gun doesn't work!

371
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:26,609
That's a safety feature.
They won't fire until

372
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:29,529
- Travis fires first.
- Why the hell not?

373
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:32,198
To keep clients from
shooting things they shouldn't.

374
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,410
Derris, let's not mention this
in our report.

375
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,787
- No harm, no foul.
- Appreciate it.

376
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:40,582
I'm not that big of a dick.
I just like to talk.

377
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:43,835
Eckles is barely holding it together.
BP's through the roof,

378
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,254
breathing's shallow. Watch him.

379
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,089
This animal's big, right?

380
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:50,258
Better be for this money.

381
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:53,219
Check it out.

382
00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:56,723
That's him, isn't it?

383
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:58,808
- Guys, remember...
- Is that him?

384
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,727
...wait for my command.

385
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:05,148
Whatever happens,
do not step off of the path.

386
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,320
Holy...

387
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:11,946
Cute, isn't he?

388
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:20,204
Get a grip, Ted!

389
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:25,460
All right, big guy.

390
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:26,586
Three steps.

391
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,719
Now turn your head to the right.

392
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:38,806
Wait! Not yet.

393
00:26:41,893 --> 00:26:42,727
Hold it.

394
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:46,356
Hold it!

395
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:48,900
Now!

396
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,111
Jenny, take the shot!

397
00:26:56,908 --> 00:26:58,701
Payne, we got a major problem here!

398
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:04,999
The designator shorted out! The safety
won't release on the other guns!

399
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,377
- Fix it!
- Even if I could, it'll take time!

400
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:08,628
We don't have time!

401
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:11,839
Cut it out, for Christ's sake!

402
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:14,300
This is part of the show, right?

403
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:16,511
Over here! Try and get me!

404
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:19,472
Come on, you bastard, take me on!

405
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:21,599
Get behind the bushes!

406
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,894
That's right! Come and get me!

407
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:29,315
- Get behind the bushes!
- We're not going alone!

408
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:31,317
You guys, run! Take off!

409
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:33,319
Get behind him!

410
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,158
Over here! Take me on!

411
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:42,203
Come on! Over here, you asshole!

412
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:50,878
- Shit!
- Over here, big guy! Yo! Yo!

413
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:52,171
Jenny, no!

414
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:54,674
Jenny, get down!

415
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:57,635
Go, yo!

416
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:01,806
Come on, over this way! Over here.

417
00:28:02,557 --> 00:28:03,516
Come for me!

418
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:04,892
Jenny, go!

419
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:07,895
- Payne, my gun!
- I got it!

420
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:10,857
Over here! Look at me!

421
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:12,191
Now try it!

422
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:43,181
Don't you ever
pull a stunt like that again!

423
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:46,643
If anyone dies to save someone's rich,
fat ass, it'll be me. Got it?

424
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:49,437
Where are the clients?

425
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:53,191
Let's go.

426
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:55,276
Anyone hurt?

427
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:56,527
They're fine.

428
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:00,490
You sure he's dead?

429
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,410
- You want to check his pulse, Ted?
- He fell right where he was supposed to.

430
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:06,496
You got lucky.

431
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:09,040
Did anyone break any protocols?

432
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:10,959
Then we're clean.

433
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:13,044
- Travis, the volcano.
- We better get going.

434
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:14,420
Follow me.

435
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:39,612
By the time I'm done suing you,
I am going to own this joint!

436
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:41,656
That's your right, Mr. Middleton.

437
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:43,950
I understand you're upset.

438
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:46,160
But look beyond
your immediate feelings.

439
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:48,705
Look at what you achieved today.

440
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:50,999
I almost achieved getting eaten!

441
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:52,584
And you weren't.

442
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:55,336
Countless clients
have jumped back through time

443
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:58,673
faced the allosaurus, and gone home

444
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:02,010
proud that they cheated death.
And in reality, they cheated nothing.

445
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:05,179
It was elaborate, expensive,
authentic, and a fantasy.

446
00:30:05,388 --> 00:30:06,472
It was controlled.

447
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:09,183
The outcome never in doubt.
Not for a moment.

448
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:10,476
You two.

449
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:14,063
Circumstances were thrust upon you,
like all moments of great courage.

450
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:18,026
Sue me if you want to,
but for Christ's sake,

451
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:20,445
look at what you two did today.

452
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:24,032
You faced death for real!
All controls off

453
00:30:24,282 --> 00:30:25,700
and you survived!

454
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,870
You stood shoulder-to-shoulder,
Columbus...

455
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:30,413
Jesus.

456
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,917
...discovering America,
Armstrong walking on the moon,

457
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:36,961
Brubaker landing on Mars!

458
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,675
You are true pioneers!

459
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:45,470
Gentlemen,

460
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:48,348
I salute you.

461
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:09,202
I swear, that dude could sell
art lessons to a blind man.

462
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:10,995
So what happened?

463
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:14,666
Moisture damage. A leak

464
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:16,751
from a broken box of nitrogen bullets.

465
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:18,670
I tested the gun before we jumped,

466
00:31:18,878 --> 00:31:20,672
but the short occurred after.

467
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,883
We have to change our whole procedure.
This cannot happen again.

468
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,552
It was an accident, you know?

469
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,889
We cannot have accidents.

470
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,017
While I was a physics major in college,

471
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:37,313
we studied something called
the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

472
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:40,066
It proves that there is no such thing

473
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:42,819
as zero tolerance. It doesn't exist.

474
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:46,823
You basically can't be
a hundred percent sure of anything.

475
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:49,701
No matter how hard you try, accidents...

476
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:51,119
...happen.

477
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:54,289
We can't have accidents.

478
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,846
Good evening, Dr. Ryer.
How about this weather?

479
00:32:10,054 --> 00:32:12,640
I guess this is
what they call Indian summer.

480
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:15,143
70 degrees... in November!

481
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:17,895
It's different, that's for sure.

482
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:37,457
<i>Unseasonably hot weather continues
today with highs in the upper 80s.</i>

483
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:39,500
<i>The skies will be clear</i>

484
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:42,170
<i>and the humidity
will remain around 90 percent.</i>

485
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:45,506
<i>Thousands of fish beached themselves
on the shore of Lake Michigan overnight.</i>

486
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:49,260
<i>Scientists from the University
of Chicago are investigating.</i>

487
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:52,347
<i>They're at a loss to explain
what caused the phenomenon.</i>

488
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:55,391
<i>The beaching provides an opportunity
for amateur fishermen,</i>

489
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,186
<i>but wait until
the cause is determined</i>

490
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:00,605
<i>before you eat your catch.</i>

491
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:03,399
<i>Suicidal fish. That's a new one.</i>

492
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:04,609
<i>The Health Department says</i>

493
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:07,153
<i>that the UV count is extremely high,</i>

494
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:09,489
<i>so if you want to soak up</i>

495
00:33:09,697 --> 00:33:12,242
<i>this amazing
warm sunshine in November,</i>

496
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:13,910
<i>you'd better protect yourself.</i>

497
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:17,121
<i>An SPF of 45
or stronger is recommended.</i>

498
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:28,675
What happened here?

499
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:30,051
Check it out.

500
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,720
This wall's at least
three feet thick.

501
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:35,139
That plant
must've really wanted out, huh?

502
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:46,567
Sorry.

503
00:33:46,776 --> 00:33:48,361
What? You've seen me skinny-dipping.

504
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,862
You were eight.

505
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:51,114
Get over it.

506
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:55,034
When did you become such a brat?

507
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:57,829
You ready for this today?

508
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:00,707
You know what they say
about falling off a horse?

509
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:01,874
Take a cab?

510
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:03,501
Get right back on.

511
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:07,297
What if your horse weighs
12,000 pounds and tries to eat you?

512
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:11,342
Everyone, everyone!

513
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:15,555
Mr. Zong, Mr. Chang,
get ready for the ride of your lives!

514
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:19,601
Travis! Don't you want to say
something about the light?

515
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:24,188
Gentlemen,
please don't look at the lights.

516
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:27,817
Whatever.

517
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:30,737
All right. Let's do this.

518
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:57,597
You feel it?

519
00:34:57,805 --> 00:34:59,223
Something's off.

520
00:35:00,725 --> 00:35:02,185
Something's different.

521
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:10,485
Travis! Look!

522
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:20,119
Oh, my God.

523
00:35:20,328 --> 00:35:21,287
What is noise?

524
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:23,331
Back to the portal! Now!

525
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,792
Everybody get back! Move!

526
00:35:26,751 --> 00:35:28,878
Get them back to the portal now!

527
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:30,588
Come on, let's go! Hurry!

528
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:32,382
Move! Get back!

529
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:33,883
Jenny, leave it!

530
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:36,803
When the path retracts,
it'll fall! On the ground!

531
00:35:38,596 --> 00:35:40,306
Get them back to the portal now!

532
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,351
Let's go, Jenny! Come on!

533
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:45,311
I said, let's go!

534
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:47,397
I can do this! Calm down!

535
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:50,400
Keep moving!

536
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:52,902
Run!

537
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:54,821
Jenny, run!

538
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:09,877
Lucas! What the hell
just happened back there?

539
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:12,255
TAMI missed her entry point
by five minutes!

540
00:36:12,505 --> 00:36:14,841
- We were late!
- Make sure everyone's all right.

541
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:17,468
TAMI has never been off
by a millisecond before.

542
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:20,054
TAMI, why were you off
in your calculations?

543
00:36:20,263 --> 00:36:21,931
<i>Please be specific, Dr. Ryer.</i>

544
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,435
On our last jump, you missed
our entry point by five minutes.

545
00:36:25,643 --> 00:36:27,937
<i>- Why?
- I'm afraid you're mistaken, Doctor.</i>

546
00:36:28,146 --> 00:36:31,983
<i>My calculations were precise. You were
sent to the correct coordinates.</i>

547
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:33,359
We need to talk.

548
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:43,494
We've just stepped
into a world of trouble.

549
00:36:43,703 --> 00:36:46,164
She was off by five minutes,
out of 65 million years.

550
00:36:46,372 --> 00:36:48,333
It's a minor glitch.
We can fix it.

551
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:50,043
I had to file a report.

552
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:52,253
Jeez, Clay,
you didn't have to do that.

553
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:54,255
I had no alternative.

554
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:56,674
Of course you had an alternative.

555
00:36:56,883 --> 00:36:59,761
You could have thought big
instead of little, which is all

556
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:02,889
your pea-brain is capable of
before it explodes.

557
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:05,642
Now you get to cause me grief
just because you can.

558
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,394
History's not a class struggle,
it's a vision struggle.

559
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:11,606
It's people like me trying to get free
from narrow-minded pricks like you.

560
00:37:11,814 --> 00:37:14,442
Nothing moves without us,
we're the goddamned engine.

561
00:37:14,692 --> 00:37:17,987
- This is out of my hands now.
- Like hell it is.

562
00:37:18,196 --> 00:37:21,574
You know that regulations dictate
that this meeting has to be recorded.

563
00:37:21,824 --> 00:37:22,784
Of course.

564
00:37:24,702 --> 00:37:27,288
The Temporal Regulation Division

565
00:37:27,497 --> 00:37:29,457
proclaims this facility closed.

566
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,129
TAMI...

567
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:36,297
<i>ItAL Access denied.</i>

568
00:37:37,715 --> 00:37:39,467
They don't waste time.

569
00:38:01,531 --> 00:38:03,533
You can't ask me to do that.

570
00:38:03,741 --> 00:38:06,035
I'm not asking you to do anything!

571
00:38:06,244 --> 00:38:10,164
I'm simply reminding you of the
potential delicacy of our situation.

572
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:11,165
What's done is done.

573
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:13,751
Even I have my limits. I can't.

574
00:38:17,255 --> 00:38:20,341
We can't leave this
to some government agency

575
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:22,260
to figure out.

576
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:24,345
Why not? It's their job.

577
00:38:24,554 --> 00:38:25,638
They're bureaucrats.

578
00:38:25,888 --> 00:38:28,641
If they fell out of a window, it would
take them a week to hit the ground.

579
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:31,060
Do you have any idea
how long it would take them

580
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:33,271
to clear this up?

581
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:36,316
They'll have TAMI shut down for months.
I'll go bankrupt.

582
00:38:36,524 --> 00:38:38,610
What happened today
has to be connected to our last jump.

583
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:41,529
- We must have changed something.
- You just made that up.

584
00:38:41,738 --> 00:38:43,573
Something happened back there.
I know it.

585
00:38:43,781 --> 00:38:46,576
Really? You know it?
You don't know anything of the kind!

586
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:49,746
I'll tell you what,
there is someone who does know.

587
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:32,622
You okay, man?

588
00:40:06,864 --> 00:40:08,491
We represent the tenant board.

589
00:40:08,741 --> 00:40:11,119
We have vines growing
into our windows, down the halls,

590
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:13,162
one broke the elevator!

591
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:15,582
Open this door at once!

592
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:16,541
Dr. Rand!

593
00:40:16,749 --> 00:40:19,168
This is loaded! Now back off!

594
00:40:19,377 --> 00:40:20,461
She's crazy!

595
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,046
You're crazy!

596
00:40:29,971 --> 00:40:31,639
Dr. Rand, I need...

597
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:41,649
Excuse me.
Where are you delivering that?

598
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,027
Rand. 7-E.

599
00:40:47,238 --> 00:40:49,490
I told you, I'm not responsible.

600
00:40:49,699 --> 00:40:51,326
Look outside,
it's happening out there, too.

601
00:40:51,576 --> 00:40:54,037
Use your brain
while you still have one.

602
00:40:54,704 --> 00:40:55,997
Fertilizer.

603
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:01,794
Lady, it's real heavy.

604
00:41:05,673 --> 00:41:06,633
Close the door.

605
00:41:17,435 --> 00:41:19,437
Put it by the rhododendron.

606
00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:23,733
The white flowers.

607
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:26,903
Then go.

608
00:41:30,406 --> 00:41:32,283
I thought I recognized your voice.

609
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:36,246
You sound just like TAMI.
Although, she's a little nicer.

610
00:41:36,496 --> 00:41:39,457
That thing doesn't work.
It's an antique.

611
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:42,460
I've been expecting you.

612
00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:44,504
I'm afraid we've done it.
What you warned us about.

613
00:41:44,712 --> 00:41:46,297
- I knew it.
- What do you mean?

614
00:41:46,547 --> 00:41:49,550
- Don't I seem a little on edge?
- About the same as last time.

615
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,761
How far back?

616
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,012
The Cretaceous.

617
00:41:53,221 --> 00:41:54,931
Jesus. And what did you change?

618
00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:57,934
We don't know. As far as we can tell,
no one stepped off the path.

619
00:41:58,142 --> 00:41:59,519
The animal fell in the kill zone.

620
00:42:00,937 --> 00:42:03,314
The kill zone, the path.
The kill zone, the path.

621
00:42:03,481 --> 00:42:05,024
You're so blind.

622
00:42:05,233 --> 00:42:07,110
24 hours, isn't it?
Since you got back.

623
00:42:08,486 --> 00:42:09,529
Yeah, almost exactly.

624
00:42:09,737 --> 00:42:10,780
- Why?
- Watch this.

625
00:42:26,129 --> 00:42:27,589
Son-of-a-bitch.

626
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:44,772
- That was you.
- What the hell was that?

627
00:42:44,981 --> 00:42:48,276
A time wave. So much
for your system being bulletproof.

628
00:43:00,204 --> 00:43:01,164
Jesus.

629
00:43:05,001 --> 00:43:07,003
Let's go. Get moving!

630
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:32,070
- What is that pipe for?
- Water for the oxygen condensers.

631
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:41,704
Over there, get over there!

632
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:46,960
The oxygen!

633
00:43:47,877 --> 00:43:48,753
Come on!

634
00:44:05,979 --> 00:44:07,397
You okay?

635
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:16,406
Look at this!

636
00:44:18,908 --> 00:44:22,620
This tree was never here before.
It's extraordinary.

637
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:25,039
It's okay.

638
00:44:41,264 --> 00:44:44,183
I think the window's our best bet.

639
00:44:50,106 --> 00:44:53,693
Jesus. Why didn't this happen
until now? Why the delay?

640
00:44:53,943 --> 00:44:57,030
When you change something in the past,
the future isn't affected all at once.

641
00:44:57,238 --> 00:45:00,700
Changes come in ripples,
like dropping a stone into a pond.

642
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:02,869
So you mean there'll be more of these.

643
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,496
And they'll get bigger and bigger.

644
00:45:05,705 --> 00:45:09,834
All the changes in evolution
that you affected will come in the waves.

645
00:45:10,001 --> 00:45:12,754
It'll start with climate,
then vegetation,

646
00:45:12,921 --> 00:45:14,631
the early manifestations of life.

647
00:45:14,839 --> 00:45:17,425
Then come the more complex organisms.

648
00:45:18,968 --> 00:45:22,096
- So what will happen in the last wave?
- It'll be us.

649
00:45:22,347 --> 00:45:23,306
We wave goodbye.

650
00:45:23,556 --> 00:45:26,517
Last wave changes
the last species to evolve,

651
00:45:26,726 --> 00:45:29,562
Homo sapiens.
God knows what we'll become.

652
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:31,940
We may have no eyes,
we may be sea creatures.

653
00:45:32,148 --> 00:45:35,944
We may not exist at all. We don't have
too many more waves before that one.

654
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,404
Can we fix what we did?

655
00:45:38,655 --> 00:45:41,324
I don't know. Maybe.

656
00:45:51,084 --> 00:45:53,169
There's no way
I can allow another jump.

657
00:45:53,711 --> 00:45:55,171
I'll lose my badge.

658
00:45:55,838 --> 00:45:59,300
If we don't fix this, you won't have
a chest to pin that badge on, moron.

659
00:45:59,509 --> 00:46:02,470
Careful, you don't want
to start calling people names.

660
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:06,057
- She says it's the easiest way.
- No, I said it was the only way.

661
00:46:06,307 --> 00:46:07,350
I also said I would help.

662
00:46:07,558 --> 00:46:09,602
I didn't say I would be
in the same room with you.

663
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:11,479
Hold on. I go back

664
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:14,148
to just before
the original hunting party arrives,

665
00:46:14,399 --> 00:46:17,694
meet them when they step
out of the portal and turn them back.

666
00:46:17,902 --> 00:46:20,113
Whatever went wrong never happens.

667
00:46:20,321 --> 00:46:21,906
Things go back to normal.

668
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:25,034
- How can we be sure it'll work?
- We can't be sure if it'll work,

669
00:46:25,243 --> 00:46:28,121
but we can be sure
doing nothing will not work.

670
00:46:34,586 --> 00:46:36,254
No. I'm sorry.

671
00:46:39,173 --> 00:46:41,134
The whole of time
has been turned upside down

672
00:46:41,342 --> 00:46:43,678
and you're running around
with your toothbrush,

673
00:46:43,928 --> 00:46:45,346
worrying about your pension.

674
00:46:45,555 --> 00:46:48,558
We have more than just
a software problem on our hands.

675
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:50,560
We have got to fix this

676
00:46:50,727 --> 00:46:54,063
...and we have to make sure
no one ever finds out about it.

677
00:46:55,773 --> 00:46:57,942
If I go down,
I'm not going down alone.

678
00:47:05,283 --> 00:47:07,368
Can you compensate
for TAMI's margin of error

679
00:47:07,577 --> 00:47:09,370
so he gets where he has to go?

680
00:47:09,579 --> 00:47:11,414
Well, I built her.

681
00:47:17,962 --> 00:47:19,255
How's that?

682
00:47:21,507 --> 00:47:25,136
I want every moment
of this jump recorded, understand?

683
00:48:27,865 --> 00:48:31,077
Another time wave is coming! Hang on!

684
00:48:51,014 --> 00:48:52,515
Is everyone all right?

685
00:48:55,226 --> 00:48:56,978
Lucas, make sure everyone's okay.

686
00:48:57,854 --> 00:48:58,855
Give me your hand.

687
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:03,526
Let's see
if the backup generator works.

688
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:53,284
The power is out all over the city.

689
00:49:53,534 --> 00:49:56,162
Power's probably out
all over the world.

690
00:49:57,288 --> 00:49:58,539
Why couldn't I get back?

691
00:49:58,706 --> 00:50:01,125
You weren't able
to jump through the time wave.

692
00:50:03,086 --> 00:50:05,964
Remember, I explained
it's like a ripple in a pond.

693
00:50:06,422 --> 00:50:08,258
We can't break through the rings.

694
00:50:08,508 --> 00:50:12,178
We seem to be stuck ahead
of the changes that are occurring.

695
00:50:12,387 --> 00:50:14,555
What do we do?
Jesus Christ, what do we do?

696
00:50:14,764 --> 00:50:16,266
Let me work on it.

697
00:50:16,474 --> 00:50:18,017
This is not a time for panic.

698
00:50:18,226 --> 00:50:20,645
Actually, as times for panic go,
this is right up there.

699
00:50:20,853 --> 00:50:24,440
What we need to do is take a look at
the jump and find out what was changed.

700
00:50:49,507 --> 00:50:52,302
That was nothing.
I was standing right there.

701
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:54,387
<i>That's a safety feature.</i>

702
00:50:54,596 --> 00:50:57,557
<i>They're all tied to Travis's gun,
won't fire until he fires first.</i>

703
00:50:57,765 --> 00:50:58,683
<i>Why the hell not?</i>

704
00:50:58,891 --> 00:51:01,561
<i>To keep clients from shooting
things they shouldn't.</i>

705
00:51:02,854 --> 00:51:05,440
<i>Derris, how about
we don't mention this in our report?</i>

706
00:51:05,648 --> 00:51:07,025
<i>No harm, no foul.</i>

707
00:51:07,233 --> 00:51:08,651
<i>Appreciate it.</i>

708
00:51:09,068 --> 00:51:10,028
Go forward.

709
00:51:12,614 --> 00:51:13,656
Let's see that.

710
00:51:14,324 --> 00:51:16,284
<i>Over here!
Try and get me!</i>

711
00:51:17,577 --> 00:51:19,162
<i>Get out of here!</i>

712
00:51:19,871 --> 00:51:21,831
<i>Get behind the bushes!</i>

713
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,833
<i>We're not going alone!</i>

714
00:51:26,461 --> 00:51:28,421
<i>Get behind the bushes!
Over here!</i>

715
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:30,214
Can we follow them down the path?

716
00:51:30,423 --> 00:51:32,800
Once they're out of range of my recorder,
there's no way to see them.

717
00:51:33,051 --> 00:51:34,844
Speed up again to after the kill.

718
00:51:41,434 --> 00:51:43,311
<i>Travis, the volcano!</i>

719
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:44,604
<i>We better get going.</i>

720
00:51:44,812 --> 00:51:45,939
<i>Follow me.</i>

721
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,568
Anybody see anything?

722
00:51:50,777 --> 00:51:53,655
Anything small
that may have fallen off one of us?

723
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:04,707
Nothing.

724
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:19,847
Boys and girls,
I think I found something.

725
00:52:20,056 --> 00:52:22,183
You're not gonna believe this,

726
00:52:22,392 --> 00:52:24,435
but, according to the physical log,

727
00:52:24,644 --> 00:52:27,647
when we came back we weighed
1.3 grams more than when we left.

728
00:52:28,481 --> 00:52:29,857
What does that mean?

729
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,569
It means we brought something back.

730
00:52:32,777 --> 00:52:35,697
No, it's impossible.
There's the bio-filter.

731
00:52:35,905 --> 00:52:39,158
No organic matter
can pass through the...

732
00:52:39,867 --> 00:52:42,787
We never needed it.
We've always been so careful.

733
00:52:44,956 --> 00:52:45,999
You turned it off?

734
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:48,710
You turned the bio-filter off?

735
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:53,131
It takes a lot of energy. It costs
a fortune and we never needed it.

736
00:52:53,381 --> 00:52:55,300
My God. Are you insane?

737
00:52:56,509 --> 00:52:58,094
Did you know about this?

738
00:52:58,303 --> 00:53:00,096
Of course not.

739
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:07,896
Why does this not surprise me?

740
00:53:09,731 --> 00:53:12,692
We need to find out
what you brought back.

741
00:53:17,447 --> 00:53:18,990
Did you get through?

742
00:53:19,198 --> 00:53:23,244
Line's busy. It'll be Forrest on
with one of his pals.

743
00:53:24,662 --> 00:53:28,166
Donna will be freaking out,
all her yard work down the drain.

744
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:29,626
Do you buy it for a minute?

745
00:53:29,834 --> 00:53:30,960
The great asshole-in-the-sky

746
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:34,255
doesn't check the bio-filter once?

747
00:53:34,464 --> 00:53:36,507
Nothing gets by that freak.

748
00:53:36,674 --> 00:53:38,676
"Two years and I'll be out. "
That's what he told me.

749
00:53:38,885 --> 00:53:42,597
Got a little touchy when I asked him
how he'll retire on a government salary.

750
00:53:42,805 --> 00:53:44,557
You think Hatton paid him off?

751
00:53:44,766 --> 00:53:48,811
It would be worth it... all the money
he saved on running that filter.

752
00:53:50,396 --> 00:53:53,191
Clean. That's the last one.

753
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:56,611
It's gotta be on the clothes
on one of the clients.

754
00:53:56,819 --> 00:54:00,365
Somebody must have panicked
and stepped off the path.

755
00:54:00,615 --> 00:54:01,574
The sweaty guy.

756
00:54:01,783 --> 00:54:02,617
Eckles.

757
00:54:04,327 --> 00:54:05,286
Eckles.

758
00:54:05,495 --> 00:54:09,457
I have an idea to get you back.
It's never been tried, but it might work.

759
00:54:09,666 --> 00:54:13,294
We can't break through the rings,
but I should be able to open a wormhole

760
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,463
on the other side of the ripples.

761
00:54:15,672 --> 00:54:19,050
Instead of 65 million years,
you go back 65 million and one.

762
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:22,845
- It would be like jumping over the rings.
- And then what? Travis waits for them?

763
00:54:23,096 --> 00:54:24,472
Back here,
the change hasn't happened yet,

764
00:54:24,681 --> 00:54:27,267
so there are no time waves.

765
00:54:27,517 --> 00:54:29,811
I should be able to slingshot you
forward to the target zone.

766
00:54:30,019 --> 00:54:33,398
- You "should"? You're not sure?
- I'm fairly certain.

767
00:54:33,648 --> 00:54:36,568
But don't intercept the party
to turn them back.

768
00:54:36,734 --> 00:54:37,986
Why not?

769
00:54:38,194 --> 00:54:40,071
The slingshot effect
will use up all your energy.

770
00:54:40,321 --> 00:54:42,824
Your window will be small
and highly unstable.

771
00:54:43,032 --> 00:54:45,577
You won't have time to explain what
you're doing, let alone convince them.

772
00:54:45,785 --> 00:54:46,703
How much time will I have?

773
00:54:46,911 --> 00:54:50,123
I can't say for certain.
15, 20 seconds.

774
00:54:50,373 --> 00:54:51,791
Can you say anything for certain?

775
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,377
Yes, I can say for certain
I can't say anything for certain.

776
00:54:54,627 --> 00:54:58,298
Let's find out what we're trying
to prevent, because you won't have time.

777
00:54:58,506 --> 00:54:59,882
We better talk to Mr. Eckles.

778
00:55:00,675 --> 00:55:02,594
It'll have to be in person.

779
00:55:03,344 --> 00:55:04,470
Nothing.

780
00:55:05,179 --> 00:55:06,180
Dead.

781
00:55:13,062 --> 00:55:14,522
Where are the guards?

782
00:55:17,442 --> 00:55:18,484
What's that?

783
00:55:20,653 --> 00:55:21,738
My God.

784
00:55:26,534 --> 00:55:29,537
You're all loaded. Designators are off.
You can shoot at will.

785
00:55:32,874 --> 00:55:34,959
- Who told you to distribute weapons?
- I did.

786
00:55:35,168 --> 00:55:36,210
Just one thing. Plants like this

787
00:55:36,461 --> 00:55:39,505
- haven't grown in millions of years.
- We're shooting at plants?

788
00:55:39,714 --> 00:55:43,092
It isn't exactly like it was then.
It's stronger, more developed.

789
00:55:43,301 --> 00:55:46,012
The alternate reality
taking over outside that door

790
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,805
has been evolving uninterrupted
for 60 million years.

791
00:55:48,848 --> 00:55:51,809
Are you suggesting
that there are dinosaurs out there?

792
00:55:52,018 --> 00:55:54,062
I doubt it. More likely,
whatever they've evolved into.

793
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:55,939
That's one hell of a "just one thing".

794
00:55:56,105 --> 00:56:00,026
This building is still under government
control. I can't leave TAMI unattended.

795
00:56:00,235 --> 00:56:01,194
Of course not.

796
00:56:02,403 --> 00:56:04,697
We all set? Let's go.

797
00:56:24,384 --> 00:56:26,261
Eckles lives
on the other side of the park.

798
00:56:26,469 --> 00:56:28,805
Wouldn't it be quicker going around?
Sticking to the streets?

799
00:56:29,013 --> 00:56:30,807
- What streets?
- Good point.

800
00:57:14,267 --> 00:57:15,268
Guys?

801
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:23,067
That thing was huge.

802
00:57:28,948 --> 00:57:30,617
Let's keep moving.

803
00:57:57,352 --> 00:57:58,478
Trav, you better take a look.

804
00:57:59,103 --> 00:58:00,188
They're all over.

805
00:58:00,396 --> 00:58:03,149
Big mothers, judging by the depth.
Couple hundred pounds.

806
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:04,776
These aren't classic reptilian.

807
00:58:05,026 --> 00:58:08,905
There are other markings. A little bit
of primate mixed in. I don't know.

808
00:58:09,364 --> 00:58:10,365
That's not good.

809
00:58:11,074 --> 00:58:14,494
It means we're not more than a couple
of waves away from being changed ourselves.

810
00:58:14,661 --> 00:58:16,037
I suggest we get the hell out of here.

811
00:58:17,205 --> 00:58:18,581
Let's go.

812
00:58:29,092 --> 00:58:31,928
What do you think? Do we go around?

813
00:58:33,096 --> 00:58:34,389
What was that?

814
00:58:36,432 --> 00:58:37,600
I have got to get home.

815
00:58:43,231 --> 00:58:44,315
Lucas!

816
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,358
Get them out!

817
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:46,526
Get these thorns out of him.

818
00:58:49,571 --> 00:58:50,363
Calm down!

819
00:58:50,655 --> 00:58:52,407
- Travis?
- Hold your fire!

820
00:58:52,615 --> 00:58:55,118
Whatever's out there has been tracking
us since we entered the park!

821
00:58:57,245 --> 00:58:58,496
Man, it hurts.

822
00:58:58,705 --> 00:59:01,332
Come on, Marcus.
Try slowing your pulse rate down.

823
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:05,253
It'll slow the progress of what those
brambles put into your bloodstream.

824
00:59:05,461 --> 00:59:09,215
Whatever those thorns
put in my bloodstream,

825
00:59:09,424 --> 00:59:11,301
it's already working.

826
00:59:11,843 --> 00:59:13,595
I can't feel my legs.

827
00:59:13,761 --> 00:59:15,763
Watch out for these!

828
00:59:16,055 --> 00:59:17,056
Man, I'm losing it.

829
00:59:35,617 --> 00:59:36,868
Everything's...

830
00:59:37,869 --> 00:59:39,329
getting really weird.

831
00:59:45,293 --> 00:59:46,586
Take care of him.

832
01:00:26,918 --> 01:00:28,461
Come on. You okay?

833
01:00:28,711 --> 01:00:29,712
Get up, let's go!

834
01:00:43,977 --> 01:00:46,187
Head for the bridge now! Go!

835
01:00:47,105 --> 01:00:48,648
Aim for their throats!

836
01:00:48,898 --> 01:00:51,317
It's their only soft spot!
Aim for their throats!

837
01:00:58,908 --> 01:00:59,993
Go!

838
01:01:01,995 --> 01:01:02,829
Go on, I'll hold them off.

839
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,627
I'm not gonna leave you. Let's go.

840
01:01:10,253 --> 01:01:12,088
Travis, those thorns.

841
01:01:13,006 --> 01:01:14,340
I can't make it.

842
01:01:15,258 --> 01:01:18,344
I can't and you know it.
And I know it.

843
01:01:19,304 --> 01:01:21,973
Just set things right,
and I'll be fine.

844
01:01:22,515 --> 01:01:23,433
See?

845
01:01:25,935 --> 01:01:26,769
Just set things right.

846
01:01:26,978 --> 01:01:27,979
I'll fix it.

847
01:01:30,148 --> 01:01:31,107
Go!

848
01:01:31,316 --> 01:01:32,859
- What about Payne?
- I said go!

849
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:51,252
Why is he staying there?

850
01:01:52,295 --> 01:01:53,546
- Payne!
- Marcus!

851
01:01:53,755 --> 01:01:55,131
- Payne, come on!
- Now go!

852
01:02:08,353 --> 01:02:09,395
Forrest?

853
01:02:10,855 --> 01:02:14,067
Look, Forrest, that's Orion.

854
01:02:14,692 --> 01:02:16,694
Those stars there make his belt.

855
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,364
I'll get you
a telescope when you're nine.

856
01:02:19,864 --> 01:02:22,116
That's when Grandpa got me mine.

857
01:02:22,867 --> 01:02:26,120
Forrest. Know what those are?

858
01:02:29,457 --> 01:02:30,416
That's right,

859
01:02:31,834 --> 01:02:33,836
the Seven Sisters.

860
01:02:34,045 --> 01:02:36,089
Look like stars, don't they?

861
01:02:38,925 --> 01:02:42,512
But each one is a whole entire galaxy.

862
01:03:03,491 --> 01:03:05,994
I know how you feel.
I feel it, too.

863
01:03:06,828 --> 01:03:10,665
But if we fix this,
then he'll be right back with us.

864
01:03:11,541 --> 01:03:14,294
So let's keep moving. Eckles's place
is still two blocks to the north.

865
01:03:14,544 --> 01:03:16,879
- What are you gonna do about it?
- What are you talking about?

866
01:03:17,755 --> 01:03:19,299
It can't ever happen again.

867
01:03:19,507 --> 01:03:23,261
If we're lucky enough to fix things,
it'll go back to the way it was before.

868
01:03:23,469 --> 01:03:26,264
We have to stop it, the Hattons,
Time Safari, the whole thing.

869
01:03:26,472 --> 01:03:28,182
If we fix the time line, though,

870
01:03:28,391 --> 01:03:30,977
when we come back, we won't know
any of this has happened.

871
01:03:31,227 --> 01:03:33,021
So now you see the problem.

872
01:03:47,869 --> 01:03:50,455
At least it means there's still
some people alive in there.

873
01:03:50,663 --> 01:03:53,541
- I think we can get down here.
- Those creatures back there are smart.

874
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:55,668
A lot smarter than us
if we don't get over this wall.

875
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,253
Wait.

876
01:04:12,852 --> 01:04:14,354
There's got to be
something around here.

877
01:04:15,104 --> 01:04:15,855
You see anything over there?

878
01:04:21,236 --> 01:04:22,028
What's this?

879
01:04:23,196 --> 01:04:24,364
I got something.

880
01:04:25,073 --> 01:04:26,157
What the...

881
01:04:36,918 --> 01:04:38,002
Daddy!

882
01:04:47,929 --> 01:04:49,931
It's okay, stay where you are.

883
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:11,995
All right. It's okay.

884
01:05:22,755 --> 01:05:23,590
We don't have room.

885
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,425
- He saved their lives!
- Go somewhere else.

886
01:05:25,633 --> 01:05:27,760
Either let us in or kill us.

887
01:05:37,854 --> 01:05:40,607
We just need to find
someone and then we'll go.

888
01:05:41,691 --> 01:05:43,526
Ted Eckles.

889
01:05:45,278 --> 01:05:48,364
He lives in this building.
Does anyone know where we can find him?

890
01:05:51,951 --> 01:05:53,244
Apartment 6-A.

891
01:05:54,746 --> 01:05:57,081
When we're done, we'll get you food.

892
01:06:18,478 --> 01:06:21,731
- No! That's Ally's.
- The fire's going out.

893
01:06:21,981 --> 01:06:22,941
Not that!

894
01:06:23,149 --> 01:06:25,068
- Mr. Eckles.
- Who the hell are you?

895
01:06:25,276 --> 01:06:26,486
Remember me?

896
01:06:26,694 --> 01:06:30,365
Somebody brought something back
from your jump. Something small.

897
01:06:31,407 --> 01:06:32,659
Check in there.

898
01:06:37,247 --> 01:06:39,415
Jenny! Look at this.

899
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:42,585
We have reason to believe
somebody stepped off the path.

900
01:06:42,752 --> 01:06:43,628
Are you accusing me?

901
01:06:46,005 --> 01:06:48,007
We're not accusing you of anything.

902
01:06:48,216 --> 01:06:51,010
Maybe in the excitement something
happened. Maybe you don't remember.

903
01:06:55,265 --> 01:06:58,351
We think something happened
on your hunt that caused all this.

904
01:06:58,601 --> 01:07:01,229
If we can find out what it was,
we might be able to set it straight.

905
01:07:01,437 --> 01:07:03,106
I didn't step off the path.

906
01:07:07,151 --> 01:07:10,113
You think because I was scared I didn't
listen and I stepped off the path.

907
01:07:10,321 --> 01:07:12,365
- Well, I didn't!
- He's telling the truth.

908
01:07:12,574 --> 01:07:14,117
I've been over every inch of
his clothes, there's nothing on them.

909
01:07:14,284 --> 01:07:15,577
What about your friend?

910
01:07:15,785 --> 01:07:19,163
I don't know if...
We weren't together the whole time.

911
01:07:19,372 --> 01:07:21,374
- You were separated?
- Just for a few seconds.

912
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:23,626
We have to find him.
A time wave could come any moment.

913
01:07:23,835 --> 01:07:24,836
Where does he live?

914
01:07:25,086 --> 01:07:27,672
He's not at his apartment.
His wife kicked him out.

915
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,049
He stays at his office
at the Division Tower, 23rd floor.

916
01:07:30,174 --> 01:07:31,384
We'll never make it on foot.

917
01:07:31,426 --> 01:07:33,052
There's a parking garage down below.

918
01:07:34,095 --> 01:07:36,431
All right.
Thank you, Mr. Eckles. Let's go.

919
01:07:38,641 --> 01:07:40,435
- You have to.
- I have to what?

920
01:07:40,643 --> 01:07:41,769
Set things right.

921
01:07:41,978 --> 01:07:43,354
We will.

922
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:54,115
Sonic resonator lock mechanism.
Almost impossible to break.

923
01:07:54,324 --> 01:07:55,408
Any suggestions?

924
01:07:55,658 --> 01:07:58,536
If we had an audio oscillator
I could find the waves and...

925
01:08:07,086 --> 01:08:09,297
How do you think I put myself
through medical school?

926
01:08:21,476 --> 01:08:23,686
We promised those people
we'd get them food.

927
01:08:23,895 --> 01:08:26,314
In an hour we'll have the time line
fixed and they won't need it.

928
01:08:26,564 --> 01:08:28,149
- What if we don't get it fixed?
- Then they'll be the food.

929
01:08:28,358 --> 01:08:29,567
Look out!

930
01:08:31,444 --> 01:08:32,528
What the hell was that?

931
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,289
Sonia, come with me.

932
01:08:43,539 --> 01:08:45,667
You two stay to protect the car.

933
01:08:47,001 --> 01:08:48,378
Thanks.

934
01:09:03,226 --> 01:09:04,394
Brambles.

935
01:09:04,686 --> 01:09:05,812
Be careful.

936
01:09:27,667 --> 01:09:29,377
What the hell happened here?

937
01:09:29,586 --> 01:09:30,503
Look at this.

938
01:09:32,672 --> 01:09:34,048
Jesus!

939
01:09:35,967 --> 01:09:39,220
It's the brambles. These people
went crazy and killed each other.

940
01:09:53,943 --> 01:09:55,445
Mr. Middleton?

941
01:10:06,205 --> 01:10:08,124
Get out of here!
There's no food in here!

942
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:09,292
Mr. Middleton!

943
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:13,296
It's Travis Ryer from Time Safari.
We just want to talk to you.

944
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:17,675
Mr. Middleton, we're gonna come in.

945
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:29,395
Mr. Middleton, we just want to talk.

946
01:10:29,896 --> 01:10:31,648
Okay? We're gonna come in.

947
01:10:34,984 --> 01:10:36,694
What do you want? Who is she?

948
01:10:36,903 --> 01:10:38,863
Be careful, he's infected.

949
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:41,449
No whispering!
You think I can't hear you?

950
01:10:41,699 --> 01:10:44,327
She's with the company. We just want
to look at your outfit from the jump.

951
01:10:44,577 --> 01:10:45,495
Why?

952
01:10:45,745 --> 01:10:47,956
Someone may have inadvertently
brought something back.

953
01:10:48,122 --> 01:10:51,084
Who told you that?
Eckles, that little weasel?

954
01:10:51,626 --> 01:10:53,670
He hates me! He's lying!

955
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,047
Not your fault.
You're not in trouble.

956
01:10:56,256 --> 01:10:57,131
Damn right, I'm not!

957
01:10:57,715 --> 01:10:59,092
Where are you?

958
01:10:59,467 --> 01:11:02,136
How dare you come here and accuse me?

959
01:11:06,349 --> 01:11:09,561
That piece of crap safari!
I haven't felt right since!

960
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:31,374
Don't you run away
when I'm talking to you!

961
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,214
Drop the gun!
I don't want to shoot you.

962
01:11:38,423 --> 01:11:39,674
Why not? I want to shoot you.

963
01:11:39,882 --> 01:11:41,759
Listen to me, we can fix this.

964
01:11:41,968 --> 01:11:43,052
No, you can't.

965
01:11:43,261 --> 01:11:44,804
Nobody can.

966
01:11:53,187 --> 01:11:56,274
Tell me I wasn't lying.
Tell me we can fix this.

967
01:11:58,693 --> 01:12:00,820
Family albums, nice.

968
01:12:02,322 --> 01:12:03,573
Here we go!

969
01:12:10,371 --> 01:12:11,372
I don't believe it.

970
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:15,293
A single butterfly.

971
01:12:15,501 --> 01:12:16,586
Isn't that amazing?

972
01:12:17,128 --> 01:12:18,087
Yes, it is.

973
01:12:22,634 --> 01:12:23,635
What the hell are you shooting at?

974
01:12:23,843 --> 01:12:26,930
Those birds, if that's what they are.
Did you find it?

975
01:12:27,138 --> 01:12:29,474
Middleton stepped off the path.
He killed a butterfly.

976
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:41,986
- A butterfly caused all this?
- Is that so hard to believe?

977
01:12:42,153 --> 01:12:44,781
- It's a bug!
- It's an insect that laid eggs.

978
01:12:44,989 --> 01:12:48,743
The point is, Jenny, it wasn't a bug
that was stepped on, it was evolution.

979
01:13:25,947 --> 01:13:26,864
Watch it!

980
01:13:42,297 --> 01:13:43,881
The wave's coming!

981
01:13:47,552 --> 01:13:48,803
Hang on!

982
01:14:48,529 --> 01:14:50,448
This can't be good.

983
01:14:54,244 --> 01:14:55,161
Travis?

984
01:14:58,581 --> 01:14:59,749
It's Hatton.

985
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:03,670
I got a feeling there's only one wave
left, then it's our turn to be altered.

986
01:15:03,878 --> 01:15:06,047
This isn't gonna be easy to do
with flippers instead of arms, is it?

987
01:15:06,839 --> 01:15:09,801
If this place is wrecked,
then we won't be able to send you back.

988
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:13,555
Then we have to find a way to make
another place work. Is it possible?

989
01:15:14,013 --> 01:15:15,306
Let me think.

990
01:15:16,099 --> 01:15:17,225
Maybe.

991
01:15:17,475 --> 01:15:20,186
Let's take a look around
and see what we can salvage here.

992
01:15:20,395 --> 01:15:24,440
Okay, with TAMI's hard drive,
all we need is another portal.

993
01:15:24,691 --> 01:15:27,151
- Let's go to Home Depot.
- There's one at the University.

994
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,862
- A Home Depot?
- No, a portal.

995
01:15:30,071 --> 01:15:32,824
Well, not exactly a portal,
a particle accelerator.

996
01:15:33,241 --> 01:15:36,744
With the right software it becomes
a portal. TAMI's hard drive is.

997
01:15:36,995 --> 01:15:39,122
- Are we talking "plug and play"?
- Yeah, more or less.

998
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:42,083
- Which one is it? More or less?
- More, I hope.

999
01:15:42,292 --> 01:15:44,961
Get the jumpsuit,
I'll try and make this work.

1000
01:15:45,795 --> 01:15:49,048
The University is two miles away.
Will we travel through the city on foot?

1001
01:15:49,257 --> 01:15:50,800
Derris! What are you doing in here?

1002
01:15:52,594 --> 01:15:54,012
Please be quiet.

1003
01:15:54,262 --> 01:15:55,054
What are you talking about?

1004
01:15:57,348 --> 01:15:59,475
- You'll wake them up.
- Wake who?

1005
01:16:14,574 --> 01:16:15,408
My God.

1006
01:16:30,715 --> 01:16:33,009
We still have a chance,
but we have to go now.

1007
01:16:33,217 --> 01:16:35,053
Come on. We're getting out of here.

1008
01:16:35,511 --> 01:16:38,640
There's still time,
but we've got to hurry.

1009
01:16:56,658 --> 01:16:58,284
Suit yourself.

1010
01:17:04,249 --> 01:17:05,333
Wait.

1011
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:10,588
You can't leave me here.

1012
01:17:12,006 --> 01:17:13,383
Wait for me.

1013
01:17:33,903 --> 01:17:36,739
We can go underground
using the subway tracks.

1014
01:17:41,202 --> 01:17:42,579
What's that smell?

1015
01:17:42,787 --> 01:17:44,831
- Rotten eggs?
- Sulfur.

1016
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,669
- It's a swamp.
- Let's go back up.

1017
01:17:49,877 --> 01:17:51,004
No, this is the only way.

1018
01:17:51,254 --> 01:17:54,299
You're crazy, I'm not going in there.
I say we go back up and run for it.

1019
01:17:54,507 --> 01:17:56,134
God knows what's under there.

1020
01:17:59,762 --> 01:18:00,805
Come on.

1021
01:18:28,291 --> 01:18:31,419
- We almost there?
- We passed two stations already.

1022
01:18:31,628 --> 01:18:34,213
It can't be more
than a couple a hundred yards up ahead.

1023
01:18:39,594 --> 01:18:40,553
Wait a second.

1024
01:18:44,682 --> 01:18:46,267
Turn off your lights.

1025
01:18:48,895 --> 01:18:50,563
Don't make a sound.

1026
01:19:05,578 --> 01:19:07,121
It's okay, come on up!

1027
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:29,644
At least it's dry in here.

1028
01:19:32,605 --> 01:19:34,732
Let's see if it's collapsed up ahead.

1029
01:19:41,197 --> 01:19:43,032
If it's clear,
maybe we can get through.

1030
01:19:49,539 --> 01:19:50,582
Let's keep moving.

1031
01:20:07,265 --> 01:20:09,934
The door's blocked, we gotta go back.

1032
01:20:34,751 --> 01:20:35,627
Jesus.

1033
01:20:35,835 --> 01:20:38,546
This thing
isn't gonna stay watertight forever.

1034
01:20:56,439 --> 01:20:58,358
There's gotta be
access vents in the tunnel,

1035
01:20:58,608 --> 01:21:00,068
some way to get to the street.

1036
01:21:00,235 --> 01:21:02,111
- How do we find out?
- We gotta bust a window and swim up.

1037
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,947
What if there's no vent there?

1038
01:21:04,155 --> 01:21:06,115
Then we drown.
But, either way, we can't stay here.

1039
01:21:06,491 --> 01:21:08,284
I'll shoot out a window.

1040
01:21:08,493 --> 01:21:10,578
It should take about 30 seconds
for this thing to fill up.

1041
01:21:10,828 --> 01:21:12,205
Stay close to me,

1042
01:21:12,372 --> 01:21:15,333
take the deepest breath of your life,
then we'll go for it.

1043
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,210
Okay. Just...

1044
01:21:19,462 --> 01:21:20,463
Give me a second, okay?

1045
01:21:31,391 --> 01:21:32,559
Come on!

1046
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:34,727
Hold on to me!

1047
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:37,730
I got you! Let's go!

1048
01:21:38,106 --> 01:21:39,065
Hold on to me!

1049
01:21:44,153 --> 01:21:45,947
Take a breath and go under!

1050
01:21:46,573 --> 01:21:47,657
Here we go!

1051
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:49,784
Let's go!

1052
01:23:27,048 --> 01:23:30,218
Travis?
Travis, stay with me!

1053
01:23:45,191 --> 01:23:46,025
Come on.

1054
01:23:46,985 --> 01:23:49,028
There's an access way down here.

1055
01:24:19,601 --> 01:24:23,396
- Those animals are pretty evolved.
- The next wave is us.

1056
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:05,146
Start praying
that the backup generators work.

1057
01:25:13,488 --> 01:25:14,739
Oh, yes.

1058
01:25:21,788 --> 01:25:23,122
Not good.

1059
01:25:30,672 --> 01:25:32,799
Almost there, get ready.

1060
01:25:43,393 --> 01:25:46,271
Remember, even if this works
it'll be highly unstable.

1061
01:25:46,479 --> 01:25:47,939
You'll have about 20 seconds.

1062
01:25:51,192 --> 01:25:53,736
<i>Hello, Dr. Rand.
Where exactly are we?</i>

1063
01:25:53,987 --> 01:25:55,029
We're at the University.

1064
01:25:55,238 --> 01:25:57,907
<i>In the public sector now?
Not a good sign.</i>

1065
01:25:58,157 --> 01:26:00,660
We're going to attempt
a slingshot jump. What do you think?

1066
01:26:00,868 --> 01:26:02,912
<i>It's theoretical.
It's never been attempted.</i>

1067
01:26:03,162 --> 01:26:04,539
There's a first time for everything.

1068
01:26:18,261 --> 01:26:19,387
It's gonna hurt.

1069
01:26:19,596 --> 01:26:23,057
You'll be back a year before the hunt
for about half a nanosecond,

1070
01:26:23,266 --> 01:26:25,310
then you'll be thrown
forward again to the hunt.

1071
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:27,353
- Now would be a good time.
- I'm working on it!

1072
01:26:31,107 --> 01:26:32,734
I've gotta find a way to get proof.

1073
01:26:33,735 --> 01:26:35,695
If this works,
everything goes back to normal.

1074
01:26:35,904 --> 01:26:37,822
You don't remember anything
and I don't remember anything.

1075
01:26:41,826 --> 01:26:43,953
I gotta get proof
that something went wrong,

1076
01:26:44,162 --> 01:26:45,955
otherwise
we wouldn't have made a difference.

1077
01:26:47,373 --> 01:26:49,918
We've gotta make sure
that this never happens again!

1078
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:54,255
I'll find a way.

1079
01:27:04,224 --> 01:27:05,600
The wave, it's here!
It's coming!

1080
01:27:08,311 --> 01:27:09,687
Hit a button! Any button!

1081
01:27:17,403 --> 01:27:18,529
I'll find a way!

1082
01:28:20,466 --> 01:28:21,968
Over here, big guy!

1083
01:28:25,763 --> 01:28:27,640
Come on, over this way!

1084
01:28:27,849 --> 01:28:29,017
Jenny!

1085
01:28:32,478 --> 01:28:34,647
- Jenny!
- Payne, where the hell is that gun?

1086
01:28:34,898 --> 01:28:36,524
You have to get me on the holo-disc!

1087
01:28:36,733 --> 01:28:39,110
Hatton and Derris turned
the bio-filter off

1088
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:41,487
and something went very wrong!

1089
01:28:41,696 --> 01:28:42,739
When you get back,

1090
01:28:42,989 --> 01:28:46,326
make sure you check the filter
and give the disc to me!

1091
01:28:48,995 --> 01:28:50,204
Only me!

1092
01:29:23,488 --> 01:29:26,241
Don't you ever pull
a stunt like that again!

1093
01:29:26,449 --> 01:29:29,619
If anyone's gonna die saving someone's
rich, fat ass, it's gonna be me, got it?

1094
01:29:29,953 --> 01:29:30,912
Yeah.

1095
01:29:31,287 --> 01:29:32,455
Where are the clients?

1096
01:29:38,586 --> 01:29:40,171
Why are you looking at me like that?

1097
01:29:43,675 --> 01:29:45,718
- You sure he's dead?
- You want to check his pulse?

1098
01:29:46,219 --> 01:29:47,554
Anyone hurt?

1099
01:29:48,179 --> 01:29:50,139
- They're fine.
- What happened back there?

1100
01:29:50,348 --> 01:29:51,349
Don't you know?

1101
01:29:51,558 --> 01:29:53,560
He fell
right where he was supposed to.

1102
01:29:54,018 --> 01:29:55,103
You got lucky.

1103
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:59,524
Did anyone break any protocols?
Then we're fine.

1104
01:29:59,732 --> 01:30:01,025
Travis, the volcano...

1105
01:30:01,234 --> 01:30:02,610
We better get going.

1106
01:30:02,819 --> 01:30:03,945
Follow me.

1107
01:30:08,032 --> 01:30:10,076
Clay, by the way, I know.

1108
01:30:11,035 --> 01:30:14,122
When we get back, the bio-filter...

1109
01:30:14,330 --> 01:30:16,207
turn it back on, okay?

1110
01:30:16,416 --> 01:30:17,375
Good boy.

1111
01:30:52,619 --> 01:30:54,662
Welcome! Gentlemen!

1112
01:30:55,496 --> 01:30:56,456
And well done!

1113
01:30:56,664 --> 01:31:00,168
We promised you
the experience of a lifetime

1114
01:31:00,418 --> 01:31:01,544
and we delivered.

1115
01:31:01,794 --> 01:31:05,381
As long as you know,
everything was according to plan.

1116
01:31:05,632 --> 01:31:06,799
What the hell happened?

1117
01:31:06,966 --> 01:31:10,053
Equipment malfunction.
We're okay, but it was close.

1118
01:31:14,849 --> 01:31:17,185
- Clay, what went...
- We have a problem.

1119
01:31:25,777 --> 01:31:27,195
I have to talk to you.

1120
01:31:27,362 --> 01:31:28,613
What's wrong?

1121
01:31:29,614 --> 01:31:31,824
You've gotta take a look at this.

1122
01:31:32,075 --> 01:31:35,245
I told Hatton
the recorder malfunctioned.

1123
01:31:35,453 --> 01:31:36,579
Don't let anyone see it.

1124
01:31:36,788 --> 01:31:38,122
Why? What's on here?

1125
01:31:38,331 --> 01:31:41,793
I don't know how to say this
without sounding nuttier than usual.

1126
01:31:42,293 --> 01:31:43,253
You.

1127
01:31:43,461 --> 01:31:45,797
- Of course I'm on it...
- No!

1128
01:31:46,005 --> 01:31:47,674
It was another you...

1129
01:31:48,591 --> 01:31:50,385
Actually, very much the same you.

1130
01:31:54,806 --> 01:31:57,225
Just take it and get outta here.

1131
01:31:57,475 --> 01:31:58,935
You'll understand.

1132
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:40,852
You come for another argument?
I'm kind of tired. Come back tomorrow.

1133
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:43,229
I need to speak to you.

1134
01:32:43,438 --> 01:32:44,480
Hatton send you?

1135
01:32:44,689 --> 01:32:48,401
If he knew what I had, he'd do
anything to stop me from seeing you.

1136
01:32:53,865 --> 01:32:57,035
Make yourself useful.
There's a bag of fertilizer,

1137
01:32:57,243 --> 01:33:00,038
- put it on the rhododendron.
- The white ones.

1138
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:03,791
You know, I'm a gardener myself.
I've got a fern.

1139
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,293
So, what do you want?

1140
01:33:05,501 --> 01:33:07,670
I want to put myself out of a job.

1141
01:33:09,172 --> 01:33:12,800
- I have a disc for you.
- I don't have time to watch discs.

1142
01:33:13,009 --> 01:33:16,262
Take a look at this one. Seen it
twice myself and it's got everything:

1143
01:33:16,471 --> 01:33:19,807
Action, disaster, government corruption.
It's the proof you need.

1144
01:33:20,058 --> 01:33:24,145
Everything you've been warning us about
has already happened and it's all here.

1145
01:33:26,814 --> 01:33:29,400
Why don't you stop
being such a pain-in-the-ass

1146
01:33:29,609 --> 01:33:31,277
and take a look at this?

1147
01:33:33,196 --> 01:33:34,197
Who gave that to you?

1148
01:33:34,781 --> 01:33:35,949
I did.

1149
01:33:45,458 --> 01:33:46,751
So, do you want

1150
01:33:47,627 --> 01:33:49,087
a cup of coffee?
