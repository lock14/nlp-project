1
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:40,615
Why are you laughing?

2
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,085
- I'm not laughing, just--
- No.

3
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:44,319
- But last time I thought--
- No.

4
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:48,456
You told me
it would cost $200.

5
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,390
I'll give you a thousand
to take me there

6
00:00:50,415 --> 00:00:52,158
on October 20th.

7
00:00:52,183 --> 00:00:53,326
But last time
I was talking shit

8
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,161
because I thought
you were talking shit.

9
00:00:55,185 --> 00:00:57,295
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I apologize for my language.

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,445
Sorry about that.

11
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,597
So, I really never
checked out the price.

12
00:00:59,622 --> 00:01:01,432
I even forgot--

13
00:01:01,457 --> 00:01:03,334
Yo, what up, player?

14
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,602
Yeah, I'm just
chillin' here, man.

15
00:01:05,626 --> 00:01:09,171
North Side in an hour.
I got you. I got you.

16
00:01:09,197 --> 00:01:11,474
Yo, uh, big dawg, let me
call you back, all right?

17
00:01:11,498 --> 00:01:14,409
I'll call you
right back. Peace.

18
00:01:14,435 --> 00:01:15,444
<i>5th and Trade.</i>

19
00:01:15,468 --> 00:01:17,301
So you're serious?

20
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:22,114
It's my birthday today, man.

21
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,581
- What?
- It's got to be my birthday.

22
00:01:23,606 --> 00:01:25,382
A thousand dollars?
That's a lot of money.

23
00:01:25,408 --> 00:01:26,751
I don't give a shit
if it's your birthday.

24
00:01:26,775 --> 00:01:28,585
Can you do it or not?

25
00:01:28,611 --> 00:01:30,587
You said
Blowing Rock, right?

26
00:01:30,612 --> 00:01:32,323
You want me to take you
two hours from here

27
00:01:32,347 --> 00:01:33,823
on top of some mountain where
you're not meeting nobody,

28
00:01:33,848 --> 00:01:35,591
and you don't want
to come back.

29
00:01:35,615 --> 00:01:37,359
That's what you said, right?
I told you all this before.

30
00:01:37,384 --> 00:01:38,728
I don't want to
repeat myself to you

31
00:01:38,753 --> 00:01:40,396
and every cabbie
in Winston-Salem.

32
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,230
Yeah, but, big dawg,
this is kind of strange.

33
00:01:42,256 --> 00:01:44,432
You got to
give me that, right?

34
00:01:44,457 --> 00:01:46,600
You know? You want
to talk about something?

35
00:01:46,626 --> 00:01:48,402
Forget it. I'll call
and get another driver.

36
00:01:48,426 --> 00:01:49,735
- No, big dawg, no--
- Forget it.

37
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,537
I'm your driver. Come on.
I'm your driver, man.

38
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:53,271
Don't call the other drivers.
They're not good.

39
00:01:53,296 --> 00:01:55,106
I'll telling you, they're not good.
Don't call them.

40
00:01:55,132 --> 00:01:57,341
You know? Just that--

41
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:58,643
What are you going
to do there, anyway, man?

42
00:01:58,668 --> 00:02:00,311
Are you going
to go camping?

43
00:02:00,335 --> 00:02:04,347
Are you going there to chill
with the trees and the birds?

44
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:05,772
You like birds,
big dawg?

45
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:10,618
Are you going to fly away?

46
00:02:10,644 --> 00:02:12,675
You're not going to jump, right?

47
00:02:20,685 --> 00:02:22,228
You're not going
to do that, man.

48
00:02:22,252 --> 00:02:23,628
Tomorrow's going to be
a better day, you know?

49
00:02:23,653 --> 00:02:25,229
You're just going to the
movie now, see a nice--

50
00:02:25,254 --> 00:02:27,131
How about
a hundred-dollar deposit?

51
00:02:27,156 --> 00:02:29,832
The rest also in cash
on October 20th

52
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,858
when you pick me up.

53
00:02:36,597 --> 00:02:38,697
That's fine.
That's cool.

54
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:38,360
Yo, big dawg!

55
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,951
Yo, William!

56
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,331
That's my cell phone,
all right?

57
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,332
Call me on this one.

58
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:45,433
Don't call
the dispatch anymore.

59
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,700
It's for
my preferred client, okay?

60
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:48,525
Have a good night, man.

61
00:04:13,848 --> 00:04:16,860
64-64. Dropped at
Marketplace Cinemas.

62
00:04:16,884 --> 00:04:19,177
<i>All right.</i>

63
00:04:19,202 --> 00:04:21,497
<i>Call me on Bobworth,
off of South Main Street.</i>

64
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:23,622
All right. 6-4 out.

65
00:05:41,798 --> 00:05:43,663
What's up, Ken?

66
00:05:46,634 --> 00:05:48,699
You want a cab?

67
00:05:50,704 --> 00:05:52,579
All right. Thank you, ma'am.
Morning, Pork Chop.

68
00:05:52,605 --> 00:05:55,014
Good morning, Solo.
How are you doing?

69
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,582
- Fine. And you?
- I'm chillin'.

70
00:05:56,608 --> 00:05:58,283
Listen. Remember the trip
you gave me yesterday

71
00:05:58,308 --> 00:06:00,819
from the Crystal Towers
Apartment to the movie?

72
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:03,954
If this guy calls again, please
give me that trip, all right?

73
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,689
How am I supposed
to know who's calling?

74
00:06:05,714 --> 00:06:08,459
His name is William.
You know, just ask.

75
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:10,560
I can't do it,
and you know I can't.

76
00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:12,596
Come on, Cab 1.

77
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,831
Come on, Pork Chop. You know I'm not
supposed to give out trips like that.

78
00:06:14,855 --> 00:06:16,731
A beautiful girl like you,
you can do whatever you want.

79
00:06:16,757 --> 00:06:18,699
You're rocking
this place, you know?

80
00:06:18,725 --> 00:06:21,601
Cab 1, give 1641B.

81
00:06:21,627 --> 00:06:24,571
He's just a friend. You know what I'm saying?
1641B, Lincoln.

82
00:06:24,596 --> 00:06:27,439
Listen, when are we going to
have our steak at O'Charley's?

83
00:06:27,464 --> 00:06:29,675
- Steak at O'Charley's?
- And a Tom Collins.

84
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,367
- Tom Collins?
- Yeah.

85
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,019
Yo, Mamadou,
thank you, man.

86
00:06:43,045 --> 00:06:44,588
All right.

87
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,021
So you need a ride
for the next trip?

88
00:06:46,047 --> 00:06:47,846
- No, I'm good. Thanks.
- All right.

89
00:07:06,764 --> 00:07:09,875
Morning. Solo, don't get in our
bed until you take a shower.

90
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:11,877
And your breakfast
is in the fridge.

91
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:13,636
<i>Bonjour, bijou.</i>

92
00:07:15,072 --> 00:07:16,581
<i>Bonjour</i> again.

93
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:18,415
<i>Bonjour</i> again, Solo.

94
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,951
"Captain Abisha Slade
had a slave--

95
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:23,435
"his name was Stephen--

96
00:07:23,461 --> 00:07:25,922
"who produced the first
bright leaf tobacco in 1839

97
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:28,757
in Caswell County."

98
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:31,516
That's right here.

99
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,965
"The farmer needed
sandy soil,

100
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,567
and the Appalachian
Piedmont has it."

101
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,502
That's here. <i>Bijou,</i> can
I see this, actually?

102
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:41,935
No. What about
my cell phone?

103
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,836
You know
what your mom said.

104
00:07:43,862 --> 00:07:47,629
Alex--

105
00:07:48,831 --> 00:07:51,465
Bye.
You smell like smoke.

106
00:08:24,596 --> 00:08:28,029
<i>Cab number 7, Cab 7.</i>

107
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:32,066
<i>22922.</i>

108
00:08:47,015 --> 00:08:48,926
Hey, William. I thought you
were going to the movies.

109
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:50,159
I am, and be careful
with my stuff.

110
00:08:50,184 --> 00:08:51,693
With your luggages?
What's going on, man?

111
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:52,961
I sold my apartment.

112
00:08:52,985 --> 00:08:54,662
You sold your apartment?
What for?

113
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:56,797
Moving into a motel.

114
00:08:56,822 --> 00:08:59,032
I mean, is that all you have?
Where's your stuff?

115
00:08:59,057 --> 00:09:00,732
Don't start your shit
with me again.

116
00:09:00,758 --> 00:09:03,201
Let's go. I don't
want to be late.

117
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:05,059
All right, big dawg.

118
00:09:10,732 --> 00:09:12,125
Yo, I don't get it, man.

119
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:13,543
Isn't it better
to go to a motel first,

120
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:14,912
drop off your luggages?

121
00:09:14,937 --> 00:09:16,779
Why am I with you again?

122
00:09:16,804 --> 00:09:18,947
How come it's always you
that picks me up?

123
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:21,216
Because I'm your driver now.
You know what I'm saying?

124
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,751
And anyway, I have this
I want to give back to you.

125
00:09:24,777 --> 00:09:26,486
What's this?
Come on, man.

126
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:28,588
Last time you were just upset,
so I saved it for you.

127
00:09:28,614 --> 00:09:29,789
Are you stupid?

128
00:09:29,815 --> 00:09:31,725
Or you just don't
understand English?

129
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,229
We have a deal.
Would you just drive?

130
00:09:36,254 --> 00:09:38,597
All right. Okay.
Then you know what?

131
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:40,466
Could you please call me
on my cell phone from now on?

132
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,633
Because when you
call the dispatch,

133
00:09:41,658 --> 00:09:43,033
it's always a problem
over there.

134
00:09:43,058 --> 00:09:44,918
I don't really give a shit

135
00:09:44,942 --> 00:09:46,803
which one of you people
picks me up.

136
00:09:46,828 --> 00:09:48,672
Yo, that's not
really nice, man.

137
00:09:48,697 --> 00:09:50,456
We're friends now.

138
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,241
I think I want to know why you
want to go out to that mountain.

139
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:54,744
Do you ask all your passengers
why they want to go places?

140
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:56,611
Of course.
Sometimes I do.

141
00:09:56,636 --> 00:09:58,980
And when they're fine ladies,
I ask even more, man.

142
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:01,649
Especially when
they have big booties.

143
00:10:01,674 --> 00:10:03,934
You like big booties?

144
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,221
Yo, I pick up a lot of big
booties here, man, in this cab.

145
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:08,822
You like black women, man?

146
00:10:08,847 --> 00:10:10,057
I know this black woman, right?

147
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:12,024
She's shaped like
a bottle of soda.

148
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:14,049
I can hook you up, man.

149
00:10:19,023 --> 00:10:20,198
William, you have
family here, right?

150
00:10:20,224 --> 00:10:21,515
Why don't you move in
with them?

151
00:10:25,794 --> 00:10:28,739
Yo, why family don't
stay together in America?

152
00:10:28,764 --> 00:10:30,907
If that was in Senegal--

153
00:10:30,932 --> 00:10:32,207
That's where I'm from.
In Africa.

154
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,076
You know where it is, right?

155
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,943
Dakar.

156
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,845
Yo, family stay together, man.

157
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,782
We take care of our
parents, old people.

158
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,716
Even if they don't have teeth
in their mouths anymore,

159
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:44,884
we take food and we put it
in their mouths.

160
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:46,653
Then why aren't
you there now?

161
00:10:46,677 --> 00:10:48,754
Yo, I got to make money and
send it back home, that's all.

162
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:51,023
You know what I mean? I'm going
to go there when I get old.

163
00:10:51,048 --> 00:10:52,190
They're going
to take care of me.

164
00:10:52,215 --> 00:10:54,892
Same thing your people
can do for you, man.

165
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:56,293
Who said I want
to see my people?

166
00:10:56,317 --> 00:10:57,360
Of course you want
to see them.

167
00:10:57,384 --> 00:10:58,727
They're your blood.

168
00:10:58,753 --> 00:11:01,120
And I'm sure they want
to see you, man.

169
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,316
Hi. Can I help you?

170
00:11:23,341 --> 00:11:25,183
No, thank you.

171
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,042
Okay.

172
00:11:44,726 --> 00:11:47,203
<i>All right, the
Colonial Center is all cleared out.</i>

173
00:11:47,229 --> 00:11:49,294
<i>I'm around 4th and Broad.</i>

174
00:11:50,965 --> 00:11:53,808
Hey! Hey, Solo!

175
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:56,344
Hey, William.

176
00:11:56,369 --> 00:11:57,845
What's going on, man?

177
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,278
Because of your bullshit
we're late.

178
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:00,779
The movie already started.

179
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,081
You sure you don't want
to see another movie?

180
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:03,816
I can keep your bags
and come back and get you.

181
00:12:03,841 --> 00:12:04,850
That's not a problem.

182
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,985
Oh, forget it.
Let's find a motel.

183
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:08,820
Okay, but we got to go
pick up someone first.

184
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:11,688
It's not going to be long.
Are you cool?

185
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:13,145
All right.

186
00:12:17,384 --> 00:12:21,330
Yo, William, I'm going
to Piedmont Circle Projects.

187
00:12:21,355 --> 00:12:24,131
I mean, I'm talking about
Homicide Circle, man.

188
00:12:24,157 --> 00:12:26,000
I don't give a shit.

189
00:12:26,024 --> 00:12:28,258
All right, big dawg.
Let's go, then.

190
00:12:47,044 --> 00:12:48,855
Solo. Yo, who this, man?
Yo, I'm sorry, man.

191
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,288
He's a good friend of mine.
Come on in, man.

192
00:12:50,313 --> 00:12:52,124
Yo, look, you can't be having
people riding with you.

193
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:53,125
I'm sorry, man.
It's cool, though.

194
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:54,125
It's cool.
Come on in.

195
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,293
Yo, old timer,
slide over, bro.

196
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:57,327
Yo, chill out, man.
That's my homey William.

197
00:12:57,352 --> 00:12:58,495
Man got to have
somewhere to sit.

198
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,495
Know what I mean?

199
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,130
Damn.
Yo, William, this is Roc.

200
00:13:02,155 --> 00:13:03,731
What up, player?
Chillin', man.

201
00:13:03,756 --> 00:13:05,966
All right.

202
00:13:05,991 --> 00:13:08,134
<i>I leave it to the Lord,
that's my only remedy</i>

203
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,870
<i>Before I be a rat,
I'm back in the penitentiary</i>

204
00:13:10,895 --> 00:13:13,139
<i>My niggas feelin' me
without a hug</i>

205
00:13:13,163 --> 00:13:15,274
<i>Ugly Micky Ficky's
always want a mean mug</i>

206
00:13:15,298 --> 00:13:18,143
<i>They judge and they grudge,
face the bullet slugs</i>

207
00:13:18,168 --> 00:13:20,511
<i>Niggas gettin' drugged
and they graves gettin' dug</i>

208
00:13:20,537 --> 00:13:23,313
<i>We sippin' on their mud,
sometimes I get my bud</i>

209
00:13:23,338 --> 00:13:25,916
<i>In my own zone, leave
me alone, nigga, what?</i>

210
00:13:25,941 --> 00:13:28,083
<i>Don't let the name
fool ya...</i>

211
00:13:28,109 --> 00:13:30,452
Yo, Solo, turn right
on Broad for me, dawg.

212
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,221
I got you, bro.
Good look.

213
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,761
Don't leave, man.

214
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,096
I got you, man.
I'll be around.

215
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,429
Give me the wait time
if you got to.

216
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:46,131
All right.

217
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:51,302
Yo, he's not going
to be long, all right?

218
00:13:51,326 --> 00:13:53,336
Just a couple more stops
and back to his place.

219
00:13:53,361 --> 00:13:56,162
You know what I'm saying?
One of my preferred clients.

220
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:07,282
Yo, big dawg, I got
to go take a pee, man.

221
00:14:07,307 --> 00:14:08,982
You know what I'm saying?
Are you all right?

222
00:14:09,008 --> 00:14:10,250
You okay?

223
00:14:10,274 --> 00:14:13,442
I'll be right back, man.
I'll be right back.

224
00:14:31,494 --> 00:14:34,394
<i>Cab 6-4. 6-4.</i>

225
00:14:38,365 --> 00:14:39,965
<i>Solo.</i>

226
00:14:43,503 --> 00:14:46,302
<i>Come on, Solo, wake up!</i>

227
00:14:56,212 --> 00:14:58,123
Yo, let's go!
What's going on?

228
00:14:58,148 --> 00:14:59,289
Hey, where's Solo at, man?

229
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,057
Pissing.
Aw, sh--

230
00:15:01,082 --> 00:15:02,591
Yo, Solo, come on.
Let's go, dawg!

231
00:15:02,616 --> 00:15:03,960
We got to hurry up, man!
Oh, shit.

232
00:15:03,985 --> 00:15:05,160
Come on!
What's going on?

233
00:15:05,186 --> 00:15:06,294
They tripping, dawg.

234
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,495
We got to get up
out of here.

235
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,264
Come back here!
Get the fuck back here!

236
00:15:09,288 --> 00:15:10,264
What happened, man?
Solo, let's go!

237
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:11,399
Get me the fuck
out of here!

238
00:15:11,423 --> 00:15:14,368
Get me out of here!
Drive, man, drive!

239
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:15,936
Damn!
Shit!

240
00:15:15,961 --> 00:15:18,236
Yo, Roc, what's going on?
Why they tripping, yo?

241
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:20,846
I told you I got the wait time on, man.
William, you all right?

242
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:29,580
Hey, Navani!
Navani!

243
00:15:29,605 --> 00:15:31,347
Did he tell you
why he left Winston?

244
00:15:31,373 --> 00:15:33,350
No. He just said
it was 30 years ago.

245
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,217
That's it?
No friends, no family?

246
00:15:35,243 --> 00:15:37,385
I already told you,
he didn't say anything else.

247
00:15:37,411 --> 00:15:39,520
He seems cool.
I think he's fine.

248
00:15:39,546 --> 00:15:40,522
Yo, listen.

249
00:15:40,547 --> 00:15:41,588
Offer him a round
on me, okay?

250
00:15:41,614 --> 00:15:43,789
Okay, babe.

251
00:15:43,815 --> 00:15:45,993
Yo, Solo, man, when you finally
going to get that cab fixed?

252
00:15:46,018 --> 00:15:47,293
Yo, I got you.

253
00:15:47,317 --> 00:15:48,595
I'm just waiting
for this part, you know?

254
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,529
Yo, listen, man.
I told you.

255
00:15:50,554 --> 00:15:52,932
I got a connect
in Maryland, dawg.

256
00:15:52,956 --> 00:15:55,868
This girl done told him
she got a 725

257
00:15:55,893 --> 00:15:57,369
on the credit score, man.

258
00:15:57,394 --> 00:16:00,071
Says she can get us 20 Gs
for these cabs now.

259
00:16:00,096 --> 00:16:03,640
I need you to put the drivers
in the car for me, man.

260
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,442
We could have this fire
all around the town.

261
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:08,445
Have the whole city
smoking good, cuz.

262
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,336
I got a major supply coming in right now.
It's from Solo.

263
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,104
Yo, cheers, William!

264
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:20,286
Solo, are you
hearing me, dawg?

265
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:21,653
Yo, man!

266
00:16:21,678 --> 00:16:23,655
You paying me
any attention, cuz?

267
00:16:23,681 --> 00:16:25,090
I need you to get
that cab fixed

268
00:16:25,115 --> 00:16:26,557
so we can get
this deal going on.

269
00:16:26,582 --> 00:16:28,426
I got you, player.
I got you.

270
00:16:28,451 --> 00:16:29,659
Yo, you know what?
Let's keep playing.

271
00:16:29,684 --> 00:16:31,528
I need to get
my $20 back anyway.

272
00:16:31,552 --> 00:16:33,395
All right.

273
00:16:33,421 --> 00:16:34,963
Check this out.

274
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:36,664
That's what I'm talking about.
What you got?

275
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,665
I'm going
to hit me another.

276
00:16:37,691 --> 00:16:39,933
All right, we'll see.

277
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,591
That's the first one
you done hit all day.

278
00:17:11,355 --> 00:17:13,355
William.

279
00:17:14,392 --> 00:17:15,468
William.

280
00:17:17,228 --> 00:17:18,961
Come on, we're here.

281
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,273
Where?

282
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:24,509
At my place.

283
00:17:24,534 --> 00:17:26,477
What are we doing here?

284
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:30,047
Yo, big dawg, I couldn't
find a motel on the way here.

285
00:17:30,071 --> 00:17:31,780
Why didn't
you wake me up?

286
00:17:31,806 --> 00:17:33,517
I tried, but, you know,
you wouldn't wake up.

287
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,653
You drank too much.

288
00:17:36,677 --> 00:17:38,520
Big dawg,
it's not a problem.

289
00:17:38,546 --> 00:17:40,689
You got drunk, but we had
a good time, right?

290
00:17:40,713 --> 00:17:42,557
And I get drunk all the time.
You know what I'm saying?

291
00:17:42,582 --> 00:17:43,590
Plus,
we're already here, man.

292
00:17:43,615 --> 00:17:45,392
Come on, let's go.
All right?

293
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,193
I'll find you a nice motel
tomorrow, I promise.

294
00:17:47,219 --> 00:17:48,427
All right?
Let's go, big dawg.

295
00:17:48,452 --> 00:17:49,662
I got you.
You know what I'm saying?

296
00:17:49,686 --> 00:17:52,030
I'll get you
a nice motel tomorrow.

297
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,371
No, don't worry about that.
Don't worry.

298
00:18:01,395 --> 00:18:03,695
I got it, I got it.
Don't worry about it.

299
00:18:09,068 --> 00:18:10,444
Yo, William,
this is my wife's place.

300
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,979
All right?
Navani?

301
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:13,046
No. Navani's my ex.

302
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,579
She doesn't
exist here, man.

303
00:18:14,605 --> 00:18:17,615
My wife's name is Quiera, okay?

304
00:18:17,641 --> 00:18:19,584
Yo, William,
my wife's name is Quiera.

305
00:18:19,608 --> 00:18:21,652
All right! Keep your
dick in your pants.

306
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:25,555
Okay. You know, just
making sure, that's all.

307
00:18:25,579 --> 00:18:26,689
She's pregnant now,
and, you know,

308
00:18:26,713 --> 00:18:29,023
she gets, um--
she gets very sensitive.

309
00:18:29,048 --> 00:18:30,381
You know what I mean?

310
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,326
This is Machu Picchu.

311
00:18:33,352 --> 00:18:36,363
The Inca people, they built
it about 500 years ago.

312
00:18:36,387 --> 00:18:37,697
Yeah, I know about it.

313
00:18:37,721 --> 00:18:39,464
Really? Wow.

314
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:42,433
I can't believe they did it
with their hands only.

315
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:44,102
You been?

316
00:18:44,126 --> 00:18:45,670
No, but I would love to.

317
00:18:45,694 --> 00:18:48,338
I hear it's even hard
to breathe over there.

318
00:18:48,364 --> 00:18:49,673
There you go.
This is yours.

319
00:18:49,698 --> 00:18:50,740
The bathroom's right here.

320
00:18:50,765 --> 00:18:52,641
You need anything else?

321
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,742
Do you want a glass
of water, anything?

322
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:56,510
No? Okay.

323
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,179
Have a good night,
William.

324
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,237
See you tomorrow morning.

325
00:19:30,934 --> 00:19:31,911
Solo, wake up.

326
00:19:34,805 --> 00:19:36,381
Solo, wake up.

327
00:19:36,405 --> 00:19:38,215
Wake up, Solo.

328
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,282
<i>Bonjour, bijou.</i>

329
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:40,874
<i>Bonjour,</i> Solo.

330
00:19:43,545 --> 00:19:45,688
Mom wants to talk to you.

331
00:19:49,749 --> 00:19:52,692
<i>Ça Va?
ça Va.</i>

332
00:19:52,718 --> 00:19:54,193
What's up, baby?
You want to talk to me?

333
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:55,694
Why you lying to me?
What's going on?

334
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,563
"Dear Mr. Souléymane Diop,

335
00:19:57,587 --> 00:19:59,565
"your request for a flight
attendant interview

336
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:01,365
"with Sun Airlines

337
00:20:01,391 --> 00:20:04,201
and approved
for October 15, 2007."

338
00:20:04,227 --> 00:20:05,569
Baby, is this letter
you're upset about?

339
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:06,804
Solo, this is next week!

340
00:20:06,828 --> 00:20:08,538
Yeah, but this letter
is three months old.

341
00:20:08,564 --> 00:20:09,573
I just didn't
throw it away.

342
00:20:09,597 --> 00:20:10,807
But you promised me
to give up

343
00:20:10,832 --> 00:20:13,442
this childish dream,
remember?

344
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:14,742
Baby, it's not childish.

345
00:20:14,768 --> 00:20:16,443
Why you got to say that
all the time?

346
00:20:16,469 --> 00:20:17,944
It's better
than driving a taxi.

347
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,446
Plus, you know I don't
even want to do that anymore.

348
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:21,449
It doesn't matter
what you want to do.

349
00:20:21,473 --> 00:20:23,217
We agreed that
it was best for the family

350
00:20:23,241 --> 00:20:24,884
if you drive in the day
so you could be with us.

351
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,586
Baby, seriously, I did not study.
I gave it up.

352
00:20:26,611 --> 00:20:28,653
Who's going to help me
take care of this baby

353
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,288
when you're flying
to Florida or New York

354
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:31,321
for three or four days?

355
00:20:31,346 --> 00:20:32,855
Baby, I'm here.
I need you here!

356
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:34,324
That's what I'm saying.
I'm here. I didn't study.

357
00:20:34,348 --> 00:20:36,525
And I'm sick of that taxi!

358
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:38,728
I'm going to call my cousins to come
here and fix it. No, no, no, baby.

359
00:20:38,752 --> 00:20:40,762
You know I don't want your cousins
in my business. Well, fix it!

360
00:20:40,788 --> 00:20:42,263
I will do it.
I'm waiting for this part--

361
00:20:42,288 --> 00:20:43,597
And who the hell
is that old man

362
00:20:43,623 --> 00:20:44,832
sitting in my sofa, huh?

363
00:20:44,856 --> 00:20:47,201
Tell me!
That's my friend William.

364
00:20:47,226 --> 00:20:49,603
I don't want your friend
William in my house, okay?

365
00:20:49,627 --> 00:20:51,637
Quiera--

366
00:20:51,663 --> 00:20:52,913
Quiera, that's not
really nice.

367
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,876
I'm sorry, William.

368
00:20:59,902 --> 00:21:01,744
Do you want a cup of coffee?
Do you want--

369
00:21:10,243 --> 00:21:11,752
Why you don't
let my cousins to help?

370
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:13,221
They want to, Solo.

371
00:21:13,246 --> 00:21:14,454
I don't want your cousins
in my business.

372
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,823
You know that already.
You don't do anything.

373
00:21:15,847 --> 00:21:17,958
All you do is hanging out
with your friends.

374
00:21:17,982 --> 00:21:19,648
Baby, calm down.
It's okay.

375
00:21:33,028 --> 00:21:35,239
Yo, I had this one,
like, for a month.

376
00:21:35,263 --> 00:21:36,640
A week after,
it was broken.

377
00:21:36,664 --> 00:21:38,508
I don't even want it.
I don't want to drive a cab.

378
00:21:38,532 --> 00:21:39,541
I've been doing that
for three years!

379
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:40,843
I don't want
to drive a cab.

380
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:42,944
Eh? I had given up
my flight attendant thing.

381
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,579
She goes through my stuff, and
she doesn't want to believe me.

382
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,549
You have any unsalted butter
and mushrooms?

383
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,018
I want to make an omelet.

384
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:53,551
Yo, William, did you
check in the kitchen?

385
00:21:53,576 --> 00:21:55,287
Check in the kitchen, man.
Take whatever you want.

386
00:21:55,311 --> 00:21:56,921
This is your place here.
All right?

387
00:21:56,945 --> 00:21:58,845
Take whatever you want.

388
00:22:00,347 --> 00:22:01,490
Yo, William,
do you know about cars?

389
00:22:01,515 --> 00:22:03,525
Can you give me
a hand here?

390
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:04,893
I rode motorcycles.

391
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:06,461
You mean the big ones?

392
00:22:06,486 --> 00:22:07,461
Harley.

393
00:22:07,487 --> 00:22:08,596
Harley?

394
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:10,487
Yo, you were in a gang
and stuff like that?

395
00:22:11,823 --> 00:22:12,964
Yo, William.

396
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:16,335
Open road, women,
biker's bar.

397
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:18,326
You have a tattoo, right?

398
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:20,971
Oh, my God.

399
00:22:20,997 --> 00:22:22,440
That's what
I'm talking about, man.

400
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,673
Original player.

401
00:22:23,699 --> 00:22:26,042
Wow, William
is chillin', man!

402
00:23:17,615 --> 00:23:19,625
Alex, you want
to buy this DVD?

403
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,727
I already saw it.
It's new.

404
00:23:21,751 --> 00:23:23,461
I already saw it.
How much does this cost?

405
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:24,863
This is under $50.

406
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:26,330
And actually,
they look really good.

407
00:23:26,355 --> 00:23:29,334
You go to Silas Creek,
you can pay $70 a piece.

408
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:30,801
Look at this.

409
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,637
$70? For that money
I can buy a cell phone.

410
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:35,439
Cell phones are expensive,
but look here.

411
00:23:35,463 --> 00:23:36,873
These are really good.
Look at the cloth.

412
00:23:36,897 --> 00:23:39,008
Hey, Alex,
what you doing here?

413
00:23:39,032 --> 00:23:40,541
Come on, let's go.
Let's go.

414
00:23:40,567 --> 00:23:41,976
Hey, Solo.
What's up, man?

415
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,911
Alex is trying to get
a cell phone.

416
00:23:43,935 --> 00:23:45,612
Yo, don't be selling her
your crap, man.

417
00:23:45,636 --> 00:23:46,945
What's up, man?
How you doing?

418
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:49,414
Pretty good.
What's up, Peter?

419
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,616
First time you get the
taxi, and you're still late!

420
00:23:51,642 --> 00:23:52,851
I'm sorry,<i> madame.</i>

421
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,551
Sorry about that.

422
00:23:54,576 --> 00:23:56,420
If I had a cell phone,
you can just call me.

423
00:23:56,444 --> 00:23:57,554
Isn't that right,
William?

424
00:23:57,578 --> 00:23:59,788
Yes.

425
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:01,056
Where are we going?

426
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,625
God knows where
your dad's taking me.

427
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,627
I'm telling you, this is
the best place right here.

428
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,028
You got restaurants
all over the place,

429
00:24:08,054 --> 00:24:09,130
you can walk down to them.

430
00:24:09,154 --> 00:24:10,998
It takes five minutes.
Bye, William.

431
00:24:11,022 --> 00:24:12,598
Bye, Alex.

432
00:24:12,624 --> 00:24:14,467
When is the next time
you're going to the movies?

433
00:24:14,491 --> 00:24:15,468
I don't know.

434
00:24:15,492 --> 00:24:16,634
You have
my cell phone, right?

435
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,769
Okay. You know what,
just give me a call

436
00:24:18,795 --> 00:24:20,371
whenever you need
anything, all right?

437
00:24:20,395 --> 00:24:22,373
Okay?

438
00:24:22,397 --> 00:24:23,930
Bye, William.

439
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,490
You think
he's okay in there?

440
00:24:41,515 --> 00:24:43,157
If he didn't like it,
he would just leave.

441
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:44,959
Yeah, I know,
but you don't understand.

442
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,126
I understand
more than you.

443
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,827
Hey, Malaak.
Hey, Solo.

444
00:24:48,853 --> 00:24:49,894
How you doing, man?
Very good.

445
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,061
How are you?
I'm good.

446
00:24:51,086 --> 00:24:52,730
Good to see you.
Nice to meet you, too.

447
00:24:52,755 --> 00:24:53,931
Listen, I want
to ask you a favor.

448
00:24:53,955 --> 00:24:55,665
Could you keep an eye
on my friend?

449
00:24:55,691 --> 00:24:57,834
If anybody comes, if a taxi
comes and picks him up,

450
00:24:57,858 --> 00:24:59,535
if anything strange happens,
please let me know.

451
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:00,536
I will.
All right?

452
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,537
All right.
Thank you very much.

453
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:02,538
Hey, Solo?
Yeah.

454
00:25:02,563 --> 00:25:04,673
Can I get a phone card
next time?

455
00:25:04,698 --> 00:25:05,940
You mean a ten-dollar
phone card?

456
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:07,173
Yes, sir.
I got you, big dawg.

457
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:08,174
All right?
Bye.

458
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,175
Bye.
Have a good night, man.

459
00:25:09,201 --> 00:25:11,778
Bye, Alex.

460
00:25:42,863 --> 00:25:45,073
<i>Hola.</i>

461
00:25:45,097 --> 00:25:48,065
<i>Hola.</i>

462
00:25:52,003 --> 00:25:55,038
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

463
00:26:04,013 --> 00:26:05,990
<i>Nada.</i>

464
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:25,240
Quiera, I'm really sorry,
but it's just not working.

465
00:26:25,266 --> 00:26:26,541
No, no, Quiera, I did--

466
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:28,544
Whatever you asked me
to do, I did it.

467
00:26:28,568 --> 00:26:31,246
Whatever-- No, no, no,
I never said that.

468
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,013
No, listen, listen.
No, Quiera, listen!

469
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:35,182
Quiera!<i> Allô? Allô?</i>

470
00:26:39,876 --> 00:26:42,253
She doesn't sound good.

471
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:45,712
I'm glad her aunt and her niece
are moving in, because...

472
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:48,590
What are you doing?

473
00:26:48,615 --> 00:26:51,993
Dawg, I don't even know
what I'm doing right now.

474
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:55,063
Who the hell told you
to come here?

475
00:26:55,087 --> 00:26:57,698
You know I can't go to Navani.
I mean, I just can't.

476
00:26:57,722 --> 00:26:59,965
And Roc-- Roc is in with some
stuff I'm not interested in,

477
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,067
so, you know, I figured maybe
for a couple days-- No.

478
00:27:02,093 --> 00:27:03,701
...I could--
There's no room.

479
00:27:03,727 --> 00:27:05,269
Big dawg,
this place is huge!

480
00:27:05,295 --> 00:27:07,571
In Africa ten people
can sleep in here.

481
00:27:07,596 --> 00:27:09,173
Ten people!
And plus, see?

482
00:27:09,198 --> 00:27:10,773
This is all I have.
This is all.

483
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:12,174
I have nothing else.
See this bag?

484
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,910
This is the only thing
I have here, man!

485
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:15,044
This sofa is perfect.

486
00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:16,878
All I need
is a tiny place to study.

487
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:18,212
Oh, I didn't tell you.

488
00:27:18,238 --> 00:27:20,682
Check this out.
Check this out.

489
00:27:20,707 --> 00:27:21,915
I'm studying
for my interview.

490
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:23,784
And this time,
I'm going all the way.

491
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,786
I'm telling you,
all the way.

492
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,520
No stopping!

493
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:28,623
Quiera says
I can't do it.

494
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,290
Why not?
I can do it!

495
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,125
I can do it,
because you know what?

496
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,661
I want to do it.
That's all.

497
00:27:34,685 --> 00:27:37,096
So, big dawg, I'm just going to
chill in here and study, all right?

498
00:27:37,121 --> 00:27:38,830
Is that cool with you?

499
00:27:38,855 --> 00:27:40,231
See? I'm sitting here,
I'm studying.

500
00:27:40,257 --> 00:27:41,665
Can you see me?
You can't see me.

501
00:27:41,691 --> 00:27:42,732
You're chilling over there,
watching TV.

502
00:27:42,758 --> 00:27:43,933
I'm here chilling, man.

503
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:45,234
You know what I'm saying?

504
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:46,736
This light over here--
if I turn it off

505
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,136
and I don't smile,
you're not gonna notice--

506
00:27:48,162 --> 00:27:50,005
Stay out of my stuff!

507
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:52,007
Keep your shit over there
and leave me alone.

508
00:27:52,031 --> 00:27:53,273
Thank you very much,
big dawg.

509
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:55,276
Thank you. That's what
I'm talking about.

510
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,876
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

511
00:27:56,902 --> 00:27:58,912
I appreciate it.

512
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:07,652
I have my interview on Monday,
and I'm going to ace it.

513
00:28:07,676 --> 00:28:10,186
I really don't give a shit.

514
00:28:10,211 --> 00:28:11,320
I don't want to know.

515
00:28:11,346 --> 00:28:12,654
I don't want to know
about Quiera

516
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,212
or anything
about your life.

517
00:28:17,182 --> 00:28:19,115
Sorry about that.

518
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,707
If you like this place,

519
00:28:34,731 --> 00:28:36,316
you can keep it
when I leave next week.

520
00:28:38,935 --> 00:28:41,135
Their rates
are very fair.

521
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,305
6-4, 6-4. Pork Chop.

522
00:29:44,329 --> 00:29:47,007
<i>Come on, Cab 64.</i>

523
00:29:47,031 --> 00:29:48,208
Have you ever heard
of this place

524
00:29:48,232 --> 00:29:49,776
called Blowing Rock?

525
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,743
<i>Blowing Rock?
Well, of course I have.</i>

526
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:54,078
<i>It's up in the mountains
near Boone.</i>

527
00:29:54,104 --> 00:29:55,180
Actually, I know
where it is,

528
00:29:55,204 --> 00:29:56,447
but do you know
if there's anything

529
00:29:56,471 --> 00:29:58,515
happening there
on October 20th?

530
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:00,048
<i>Not to my knowledge.</i>

531
00:30:00,074 --> 00:30:01,849
<i>We used to go there
when we were kids.</i>

532
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,151
<i>It's the only place
in the world</i>

533
00:30:03,175 --> 00:30:05,019
<i>where the snow
goes upside down.</i>

534
00:30:05,044 --> 00:30:07,820
What? I mean,
what do you mean?

535
00:30:07,846 --> 00:30:10,890
<i>It's so windy, if you throw a
stick or anything off the rock,</i>

536
00:30:10,914 --> 00:30:13,992
<i>it gets blown back
into the sky.</i>

537
00:30:14,018 --> 00:30:15,361
Blown back up to the sky?

538
00:30:15,385 --> 00:30:17,895
Are you serious?
<i>Yeah, Cab 64.</i>

539
00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:20,386
<i>That's why it's called
"Blowing Rock."</i>

540
00:30:22,391 --> 00:30:24,391
All right.
6-4 out.

541
00:30:57,354 --> 00:30:58,529
Oh, sorry, William.

542
00:30:58,555 --> 00:31:00,887
I didn't mean
to wake you up.

543
00:31:04,526 --> 00:31:06,558
I got us
some playing cards.

544
00:31:08,496 --> 00:31:09,505
And I know
you like DVDs,

545
00:31:09,529 --> 00:31:13,407
so I got you
some new releases.

546
00:31:13,432 --> 00:31:15,876
We don't have a DVD player.

547
00:31:15,902 --> 00:31:17,979
Now would you be quiet?
Oh, sorry.

548
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:20,181
Just because I know you
like movies, you know.

549
00:31:20,205 --> 00:31:22,271
Sorry about that.

550
00:31:28,378 --> 00:31:31,490
Man, I miss them.

551
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,325
Alex is getting ready
to go to school now.

552
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:36,384
She's probably having breakfast
with Quiera in the kitchen.

553
00:31:50,898 --> 00:31:52,565
Are you married, William?

554
00:31:55,001 --> 00:31:56,433
I was.

555
00:31:57,903 --> 00:32:00,448
What happened?
You divorced?

556
00:32:00,472 --> 00:32:03,550
My wife left me
30 years ago.

557
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:06,209
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

558
00:32:08,378 --> 00:32:11,289
And do you have
any kids?

559
00:32:11,315 --> 00:32:13,991
No. None.

560
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:16,426
I'm trying to sleep.

561
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:18,261
Sorry about that.

562
00:32:18,287 --> 00:32:22,055
It's just that I'm going to have
my first kid soon, you know?

563
00:32:32,465 --> 00:32:35,232
Goodnight, William.

564
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:17,181
"First Aid
and the Flight Attendant.

565
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:19,048
"Flight attendants
are not responsible

566
00:33:19,074 --> 00:33:22,352
"for diagnosing illness,
but to support life.

567
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:24,319
"No medicines.

568
00:33:24,345 --> 00:33:25,386
"Bleeding.

569
00:33:25,412 --> 00:33:26,621
"Burns.

570
00:33:26,645 --> 00:33:29,012
Heart attacks."

571
00:33:59,277 --> 00:34:00,987
<i>This is just
vitamin C, aspirin,</i>

572
00:34:01,011 --> 00:34:02,387
<i>calcium,
and antihistamine.</i>

573
00:34:02,413 --> 00:34:04,189
Antihistamine?
What's that?

574
00:34:04,213 --> 00:34:05,990
<i>That's something that's used
to counter histamines.</i>

575
00:34:06,016 --> 00:34:07,358
And what does that mean?

576
00:34:07,384 --> 00:34:08,626
<i>If somebody has allergies.</i>

577
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:11,295
<i>These are just
over-the-counter drugs.</i>

578
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,063
So none of those is for
anything serious? <i>No.</i>

579
00:34:14,088 --> 00:34:16,166
Like when somebody's
about to die or something?

580
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,067
<i>Excuse me?</i>

581
00:34:18,092 --> 00:34:19,969
Like, you know, something like
cancer or something like that?

582
00:34:19,994 --> 00:34:22,304
<i>No. Sir, if you're
not feeling well,</i>

583
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:25,005
<i>I suggest you consult
with a physician.</i>

584
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,030
<i>Are you okay?</i>

585
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,976
Oh, I'm sorry
about that, sir.

586
00:34:31,001 --> 00:34:32,311
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

587
00:34:32,335 --> 00:34:33,646
<i>Is there anything else
I can help you with?</i>

588
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,246
No, no, no.
I'm good.

589
00:34:35,271 --> 00:34:36,347
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

590
00:34:36,373 --> 00:34:37,739
<i>Okay.</i>

591
00:35:08,036 --> 00:35:09,846
There we go.

592
00:35:09,871 --> 00:35:11,681
William and me, we're in room
213-- You already told me that.

593
00:35:11,706 --> 00:35:13,282
I already put it in.

594
00:35:13,307 --> 00:35:14,784
How did you even learn
the cell phone that fast?

595
00:35:14,809 --> 00:35:17,018
It's not hard.

596
00:35:17,043 --> 00:35:18,619
Well, now whenever
you need a taxi,

597
00:35:18,644 --> 00:35:21,112
you can call me,
all right?

598
00:35:25,717 --> 00:35:27,427
<i>Bijou,</i> it's going
to be all right, you know?

599
00:35:27,452 --> 00:35:29,262
Mom says you're going
to come back.

600
00:35:29,288 --> 00:35:30,496
Whatever happened
between Mom and me

601
00:35:30,521 --> 00:35:31,563
has nothing
to do with you.

602
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:32,630
You understand that,
right?

603
00:35:32,655 --> 00:35:34,231
It doesn't matter
if I understand.

604
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:37,335
It doesn't change
anything in the past.

605
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,668
When you grow up,
you'll understand.

606
00:35:38,693 --> 00:35:41,704
I don't want to grow up
and learn all that bullshit.

607
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:44,130
Where did you learn
this word?

608
00:35:45,465 --> 00:35:46,574
You know what?

609
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:47,742
I bet you can't
even use this phone

610
00:35:47,766 --> 00:35:49,175
to take a picture of me.

611
00:35:49,201 --> 00:35:50,643
Can, too. You don't
know how to do that.

612
00:35:50,668 --> 00:35:52,045
I'll prove it.

613
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,603
You'll prove it?
All right, there we go.

614
00:36:01,344 --> 00:36:03,586
Let me see.

615
00:36:03,612 --> 00:36:06,422
How come this hot dog
looks better than me?

616
00:36:06,447 --> 00:36:08,224
That's not fair.

617
00:36:08,248 --> 00:36:10,259
No. You know what?
Show me, show me.

618
00:36:10,284 --> 00:36:13,083
How do you do that?

619
00:36:17,856 --> 00:36:21,490
<i>Downtown. I'm going downtown.</i>

620
00:36:28,097 --> 00:36:29,697
Eh!

621
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:43,219
Thank you.
Enjoy the show.

622
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:44,675
Thank you.

623
00:36:46,146 --> 00:36:47,355
Hey,
how can I help you?

624
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,322
Yeah, two for<i> Outcast.</i>

625
00:36:49,347 --> 00:36:51,880
All right.
That'll be $16, please.

626
00:36:53,483 --> 00:36:55,360
Thank you.
Enjoy the show.

627
00:36:55,385 --> 00:36:56,650
Thank you.

628
00:36:58,452 --> 00:37:00,028
I really liked the movie.

629
00:37:00,054 --> 00:37:01,630
Thanks for recommending it.
Yeah, no problem.

630
00:37:01,655 --> 00:37:03,099
Acting was great.

631
00:37:03,123 --> 00:37:04,300
I'm a big fan of--
Yo, William!

632
00:37:04,324 --> 00:37:08,237
Yo, William!
William!

633
00:37:08,262 --> 00:37:11,472
Good-bye.
Yep.

634
00:37:11,498 --> 00:37:13,297
Hey,
how can I help you?

635
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:15,507
Yo, come in the front,
big dawg.

636
00:37:15,532 --> 00:37:17,476
Come in the front.
Come, come.

637
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:18,577
Yo, what did you see, man?

638
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:19,579
How was your movie?

639
00:37:23,673 --> 00:37:26,585
Yo, why didn't
you call me, man?

640
00:37:33,516 --> 00:37:35,626
You've
underlined a lot of words.

641
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,293
Yeah, it's because
I don't know the meaning

642
00:37:37,318 --> 00:37:39,295
or I don't know
how to pronounce it.

643
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,896
Yo, big dawg,

644
00:37:40,922 --> 00:37:43,298
why don't you quiz me
on a couple of terms, man?

645
00:37:43,324 --> 00:37:46,023
Okay, we play
for this trip.

646
00:37:47,527 --> 00:37:48,902
Let me break it down
for you.

647
00:37:48,927 --> 00:37:52,239
If I win, it's free.
If you win, it's free.

648
00:37:52,264 --> 00:37:53,505
Come on, man,
just a few words,

649
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:56,463
you know, till we get
to the motel, player.

650
00:37:58,434 --> 00:38:00,777
"Deadhead."
All right, big dawg!

651
00:38:00,802 --> 00:38:03,347
All right.
So you think you can win?

652
00:38:03,371 --> 00:38:04,981
Okay. All right.

653
00:38:05,005 --> 00:38:07,782
So, "deadhead."

654
00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:11,353
"Deadhead" is the transport
of an off-duty crew member

655
00:38:11,378 --> 00:38:14,878
for the purpose of positioning
for the working of a flight.

656
00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:18,391
That's what I'm saying,
big dawg.

657
00:38:18,416 --> 00:38:20,393
That's what I'm saying.
I'm on it, man.

658
00:38:20,418 --> 00:38:22,528
I'm on it.
I'm acing it.

659
00:38:22,554 --> 00:38:24,496
Wow, you better try harder.
You better try harder.

660
00:38:24,521 --> 00:38:26,938
I'm telling you, or you're going
to pay for this trip, man.

661
00:38:28,657 --> 00:38:31,635
"In the event
of a water evacuation,

662
00:38:31,661 --> 00:38:35,271
what are the six steps
a flight attendant must take?"

663
00:38:35,297 --> 00:38:37,007
Water evacuation.

664
00:38:37,032 --> 00:38:39,009
Okay.
One, form a barrier.

665
00:38:39,034 --> 00:38:41,878
Two, check conditions
and "rhetoric"

666
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,679
if exits are blocked.

667
00:38:43,704 --> 00:38:47,416
Three, open exits
and inflate slide.

668
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,518
Four, when opening
a door exit

669
00:38:49,543 --> 00:38:50,851
to evacuate an aircraft--

670
00:38:50,876 --> 00:38:53,476
That's strange.

671
00:38:57,849 --> 00:39:00,425
Yo!

672
00:39:00,451 --> 00:39:02,827
This is cool, man.

673
00:39:02,853 --> 00:39:04,829
You got to check this out.
Alex sent me that.

674
00:39:04,855 --> 00:39:07,387
I didn't know
you could do that.

675
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:12,492
That's cool, right?

676
00:39:14,496 --> 00:39:15,994
Wow.

677
00:39:18,365 --> 00:39:20,342
How do you do that?

678
00:39:20,367 --> 00:39:21,976
How do I do that?

679
00:39:22,001 --> 00:39:24,346
How do you take a picture
and send it on a phone?

680
00:39:24,371 --> 00:39:25,713
I don't know.

681
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:27,715
That's why
I'm kind of surprised.

682
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,050
She took my picture,
but I didn't know

683
00:39:29,074 --> 00:39:30,617
you could send it
through the phone.

684
00:39:30,643 --> 00:39:32,820
Yeah.
I don't know.

685
00:39:32,844 --> 00:39:34,721
"Redirect."
"Redirect."

686
00:39:34,746 --> 00:39:36,355
"Redirect."
"Redirect."

687
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,489
Okay.
I got you, big dawg.

688
00:39:38,514 --> 00:39:42,460
"Rhetoric" is-- it means
a whole different thing.

689
00:39:42,485 --> 00:39:43,594
Okay.
"Redirect."

690
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:46,385
"Redirect."
"Redirect."

691
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:50,454
Yo, William, what's up?
How you doing?

692
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,755
Where the hell
are my clothes?

693
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,623
Oh, I'm just going
to wash them, big dawg.

694
00:40:53,648 --> 00:40:56,525
The place is a little smelly
right now, that's all.

695
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,894
I hope you're not going
to take a nap right now.

696
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,963
I just want to go
to the Laundromat.

697
00:41:00,987 --> 00:41:04,632
I'll be right back, okay?

698
00:41:04,657 --> 00:41:06,067
I'll see you
in a second, eh?

699
00:41:06,092 --> 00:41:07,490
Bye.

700
00:41:26,777 --> 00:41:28,554
Oh, Malaak.

701
00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:29,554
Aw, man.

702
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:31,056
Hey, Solo.

703
00:41:31,081 --> 00:41:32,056
You got it?
You got it?

704
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:40,518
See you, dawg.
Bye, Solo.

705
00:42:09,081 --> 00:42:10,925
Give me a sentence.

706
00:42:10,949 --> 00:42:14,094
ELB--
Emergency Locator "Beckon."

707
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:16,128
"Beacon," not "Beckon."

708
00:42:16,153 --> 00:42:17,730
"Beacon."
It's a signal light.

709
00:42:17,755 --> 00:42:19,565
"Beacon."

710
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,222
Alex?

711
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:25,202
Get me some napkins.
Okay.

712
00:42:25,226 --> 00:42:28,237
Another word is,
uh, "floo..."

713
00:42:28,262 --> 00:42:31,039
"fl-flooter."

714
00:42:31,065 --> 00:42:32,840
"Flooter"?

715
00:42:32,865 --> 00:42:35,009
"Flutter"?

716
00:42:35,034 --> 00:42:39,012
To move quickly,
like a butterfly.

717
00:42:39,038 --> 00:42:42,016
Oh, that's kind of cool.

718
00:42:42,041 --> 00:42:44,139
Take that to Solo.

719
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:48,487
Oh, thanks, Alex.

720
00:42:48,512 --> 00:42:51,188
Yo, big dawg,
thank you very much, man.

721
00:42:51,213 --> 00:42:53,056
That's cool.

722
00:42:54,516 --> 00:42:58,094
Thank you.
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

723
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:00,728
<i>Tackled denied!
Headed for the end zone!</i>

724
00:43:00,753 --> 00:43:01,896
<i>Can anybody get him?</i>

725
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,197
Good sandwich, William.

726
00:43:04,222 --> 00:43:06,500
Thank you.

727
00:43:06,525 --> 00:43:09,503
I'm used to talking to all kinds of
people and I get along with them.

728
00:43:09,527 --> 00:43:11,170
People are happy
in my cab,

729
00:43:11,195 --> 00:43:14,206
and I also know how to handle the
ones that aren't so friendly.

730
00:43:14,231 --> 00:43:15,775
Says here
you speak French.

731
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,576
<i>Oui, parfaitement.</i>
I speak French.

732
00:43:17,601 --> 00:43:18,909
I speak English,
as you can see.

733
00:43:18,934 --> 00:43:20,911
I speak Wolof.
I speak Spanish.

734
00:43:20,936 --> 00:43:23,581
I mean, I'm getting better.
My wife is Mexican.

735
00:43:23,606 --> 00:43:26,050
I also speak ten
other African languages.

736
00:43:26,074 --> 00:43:27,518
I'm a very curious person.

737
00:43:27,543 --> 00:43:29,186
I like to learn
about people's culture,

738
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:32,054
and I think that's
very important for this job.

739
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,590
That's true.
Sounds good.

740
00:43:34,614 --> 00:43:36,992
Let's go ahead
and begin the examination.

741
00:43:37,016 --> 00:43:39,751
I'm ready. Let's do it. Okay.

742
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:52,271
William! William!

743
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:54,764
William!

744
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,913
Well?

745
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:03,081
I aced it, man!
I killed it!

746
00:44:03,106 --> 00:44:04,581
They're going to let
me know in two days.

747
00:44:04,606 --> 00:44:06,282
Get your jacket.
Let's go, let's go!

748
00:44:06,307 --> 00:44:08,217
It's party time tonight, man!
Get your jacket!

749
00:44:22,188 --> 00:44:24,130
You like this music
right here?

750
00:44:24,155 --> 00:44:25,297
Yeah, it's okay.

751
00:44:25,322 --> 00:44:28,000
I grew up
in the rock and roll era.

752
00:44:28,025 --> 00:44:29,166
Yo, it's the same, man.

753
00:44:29,192 --> 00:44:31,235
You know, this is reggae,
rock and roll.

754
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,635
Big dawg,
it's the same music, man.

755
00:44:32,661 --> 00:44:34,938
But I got you.
You want some rock and roll?

756
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,639
If you can find it, yeah.

757
00:44:36,664 --> 00:44:39,340
Here we go. Sure.

758
00:44:39,365 --> 00:44:41,608
I like a little country
now and then.

759
00:44:41,634 --> 00:44:44,010
All right, no problem.

760
00:44:44,036 --> 00:44:45,077
There we go, big dawg.

761
00:44:47,605 --> 00:44:48,981
I don't know much
about this kind of music,

762
00:44:49,005 --> 00:44:50,916
but it sounds good
to me, too.

763
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,851
Well, then you've probably
never heard of Hank Williams.

764
00:44:53,876 --> 00:44:55,887
Hank Williams?
Yeah.

765
00:44:55,911 --> 00:44:57,722
No, not really.

766
00:44:57,746 --> 00:44:59,023
Not really.
Who is that?

767
00:44:59,047 --> 00:45:01,759
The greatest country writer
there ever was.

768
00:45:01,784 --> 00:45:03,927
Oh, wow. Okay.
All right.

769
00:45:03,952 --> 00:45:05,795
I'll check him out.
I'll check him out.

770
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:09,864
<i>Until that day</i>

771
00:45:09,889 --> 00:45:13,157
<i>I'll be around</i>

772
00:45:19,297 --> 00:45:21,007
Vargrave's that way.

773
00:45:21,032 --> 00:45:22,876
Oh, damn, big dawg.

774
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,177
Know what? Let me make
a U-turn up there.

775
00:45:25,202 --> 00:45:27,713
Good looking out,
big dawg.

776
00:45:27,737 --> 00:45:29,981
Good looking out.

777
00:45:30,005 --> 00:45:32,382
See if
you can hit something.

778
00:45:32,407 --> 00:45:35,119
Not with your hand, man.

779
00:45:35,143 --> 00:45:36,820
Not with your hand,
with the stick.

780
00:45:36,844 --> 00:45:38,822
All right.
Let's see that.

781
00:45:38,847 --> 00:45:40,789
William,
another one for you.

782
00:45:40,815 --> 00:45:42,291
Thank you.

783
00:45:42,315 --> 00:45:45,393
All right.
Thanks, girl.

784
00:45:45,418 --> 00:45:47,996
You know, your ex,
she's got a really nice ass.

785
00:45:48,021 --> 00:45:50,164
Yo, big dawg!

786
00:45:50,188 --> 00:45:52,331
Oh, my, my.
My, my, my.

787
00:45:52,356 --> 00:45:53,733
Come on, Roc.

788
00:45:53,757 --> 00:45:55,233
Yo, William,
what you got?

789
00:45:55,259 --> 00:45:56,902
It's all that shit
he's been smoking.

790
00:45:56,927 --> 00:45:58,269
He can't even
see the ball.

791
00:46:00,063 --> 00:46:01,806
Oh, big dawg!

792
00:46:01,831 --> 00:46:02,840
I believe I scored.

793
00:46:02,864 --> 00:46:04,007
Give me five,
give me five!

794
00:46:04,032 --> 00:46:05,273
That's what
I'm talking about, man!

795
00:46:05,298 --> 00:46:06,340
That's what
I'm talking about.

796
00:46:06,365 --> 00:46:07,742
Yo, man,
here's your money.

797
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:14,347
Yo, William, man.

798
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:16,014
I know this place.
You want to go?

799
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,382
You want another round?

800
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:18,784
Might as well.

801
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:20,251
All right! That's what
I'm talking about!

802
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,518
That place,
the music is dope.

803
00:46:21,543 --> 00:46:25,778
And they have, like,
girls with big booties, man.

804
00:46:27,181 --> 00:46:29,224
You like the big booties,
don't you?

805
00:46:40,793 --> 00:46:42,527
Ay! Ay!

806
00:46:44,463 --> 00:46:45,440
Oh, yeah!

807
00:46:45,465 --> 00:46:46,440
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

808
00:46:46,465 --> 00:46:47,909
Okay, Solo.

809
00:46:50,335 --> 00:46:53,012
Yeah!

810
00:46:53,038 --> 00:46:54,380
Yeah! Yeah! Way to go, Solo!

811
00:46:56,806 --> 00:46:57,916
And that--
They're light.

812
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,416
That-- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

813
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:01,050
I can't believe what they do now.

814
00:47:01,076 --> 00:47:03,085
That's kind of,
like, just crazy.

815
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:04,554
I need to get
one of those myself.

816
00:47:04,579 --> 00:47:06,489
You know what I'm saying?
Tired of those--

817
00:47:06,514 --> 00:47:08,990
Hello? Hey, William?

818
00:47:09,016 --> 00:47:10,458
William, it's you?

819
00:47:10,483 --> 00:47:12,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I have my taxi.

820
00:47:12,385 --> 00:47:13,960
To the bank?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

821
00:47:13,985 --> 00:47:15,563
No problem. I got you.
I got you, all right?

822
00:47:15,588 --> 00:47:16,947
Yo!
What's up?

823
00:47:16,972 --> 00:47:18,331
Can you take me somewhere?
Just five minutes.

824
00:47:18,356 --> 00:47:19,833
I got to go
pick up a friend.

825
00:47:19,858 --> 00:47:21,266
Then after that, you can
drop me off at Willard.

826
00:47:21,291 --> 00:47:23,101
But I got a trip right now.
Yo, come on, man.

827
00:47:23,126 --> 00:47:24,168
You know, I got you.
Don't worry.

828
00:47:24,193 --> 00:47:25,202
I got your back,
all right?

829
00:47:25,228 --> 00:47:26,570
All right.
I'll take you, man.

830
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:27,938
See you guys! All right, guys.
See you later.

831
00:47:27,963 --> 00:47:29,396
See you next week.
See you, bro.

832
00:47:42,043 --> 00:47:43,085
Here we are, gentlemen.

833
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,385
No, William.
We'll wait for you.

834
00:47:44,411 --> 00:47:45,487
Seven dollars.
It's fine.

835
00:47:45,512 --> 00:47:46,887
Come on, man.
We'll wait for you.

836
00:47:46,913 --> 00:47:48,088
It's okay. You're not
going to be long.

837
00:47:48,114 --> 00:47:49,489
It's okay.
I'm closing my accounts.

838
00:47:49,514 --> 00:47:51,224
Thank you very much.

839
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:55,228
William, what do you mean
you're closing your accounts?

840
00:47:55,253 --> 00:47:56,585
William.

841
00:47:59,422 --> 00:48:01,456
So we going back
to Willard?

842
00:48:06,896 --> 00:48:08,070
You know we will
wait for you.

843
00:48:08,096 --> 00:48:09,273
I have to take a nap
anyway, all right?

844
00:48:09,297 --> 00:48:11,275
I got stuff to do afterwards.
That's great!

845
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,842
Wait for me.
I'll be right back.

846
00:48:12,867 --> 00:48:14,244
I'll go get my cab.
I'll be right back.

847
00:48:14,268 --> 00:48:16,101
Wait for me here, okay?

848
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,257
Yo, man, I don't know
what's going on here,

849
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:32,059
but I got someone
waiting on me.

850
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:34,894
Do you want me to take you
back to Willard or not?

851
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,329
Come on, Souléymane.

852
00:48:36,353 --> 00:48:37,862
Yo, let's go, man.

853
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,086
Let's go.

854
00:49:19,659 --> 00:49:21,936
Yo, Solo!

855
00:49:21,961 --> 00:49:23,594
Yo!

856
00:49:34,172 --> 00:49:39,018
Solo, you left your jacket
in Oz's cab last night.

857
00:49:39,043 --> 00:49:41,019
Oh. That's William's.

858
00:49:41,045 --> 00:49:42,021
Thank you.

859
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:44,012
Yes, sir. Thank you.

860
00:50:18,278 --> 00:50:19,744
William?

861
00:50:25,684 --> 00:50:27,550
William, are you there?

862
00:53:49,244 --> 00:53:50,577
William.

863
00:53:53,315 --> 00:53:55,246
William, are you awake?

864
00:53:57,583 --> 00:53:59,250
No.

865
00:54:00,485 --> 00:54:01,728
What's wrong?

866
00:54:01,753 --> 00:54:03,695
Please tell me
what's wrong with you.

867
00:54:03,721 --> 00:54:06,864
I can't do this anymore.

868
00:54:06,889 --> 00:54:08,599
I know you don't want me
to say that, but why--

869
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:11,592
It's late.
I'm sleeping.

870
00:54:16,297 --> 00:54:17,539
I'm sorry.
I went through your stuff

871
00:54:17,565 --> 00:54:18,773
and I took your pills
to the pharmacy.

872
00:54:18,798 --> 00:54:20,275
There's nothing
wrong with you.

873
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,376
It's only vitamins.

874
00:54:22,402 --> 00:54:24,711
I didn't want to,
but I had to.

875
00:54:24,737 --> 00:54:26,213
Things are good,

876
00:54:26,237 --> 00:54:27,646
and you still want to go
and close your account.

877
00:54:27,672 --> 00:54:30,371
Why do you want
to do this?

878
00:54:34,911 --> 00:54:38,356
I went to the cinema
tonight.

879
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,246
The boy was there.

880
00:54:41,682 --> 00:54:43,226
William, I saw his photo
in your jacket.

881
00:54:43,251 --> 00:54:45,728
You left it in the taxi.

882
00:54:45,753 --> 00:54:48,463
Who is he?

883
00:54:48,489 --> 00:54:50,532
You told me you had no kids.
Why are you lying to me?

884
00:54:50,556 --> 00:54:53,289
I'm telling you everything.

885
00:54:55,226 --> 00:54:56,893
Is he your grandson?

886
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,302
William.

887
00:55:08,771 --> 00:55:09,914
William,
I want to help you.

888
00:55:09,938 --> 00:55:13,974
Did you talk to him?

889
00:55:18,713 --> 00:55:20,239
William, please.

890
00:55:20,264 --> 00:55:21,791
Did you fucking talk to him?
No, I didn't.

891
00:55:21,817 --> 00:55:23,293
But he doesn't know
who you are, does he?

892
00:55:23,318 --> 00:55:24,393
Why don't you tell him?

893
00:55:24,418 --> 00:55:25,594
I want you
to get your shit

894
00:55:25,619 --> 00:55:27,996
and get the fuck
out of here.

895
00:55:28,021 --> 00:55:30,021
William, why are you
speaking this way?

896
00:55:33,659 --> 00:55:36,235
William.
Get the fuck out!

897
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,605
We're friends now, and you want
to leave me and him, the boy?

898
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:40,706
Who the fuck told you
you could get into my life?

899
00:55:40,731 --> 00:55:42,240
Who the fuck
do you think you are

900
00:55:42,266 --> 00:55:43,708
that you can touch anything
that belongs to me?

901
00:55:43,733 --> 00:55:44,943
I got to tell him.

902
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:47,335
I got to bring him here
so you're not going to--

903
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:51,748
You're not going to
tell him a damn thing.

904
00:55:51,773 --> 00:55:53,449
You understand me?

905
00:55:53,474 --> 00:55:57,510
I told you from day one,
stay the fuck out of my life!

906
00:56:02,615 --> 00:56:03,780
I put the photo back.

907
00:56:17,996 --> 00:56:21,942
William, please,
don't leave.

908
00:56:21,967 --> 00:56:23,777
I want you to stay.

909
00:56:23,802 --> 00:56:26,646
Alex wants you to stay and
the boy wants you to stay...

910
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:28,369
if you tell him.

911
00:56:31,574 --> 00:56:32,815
I got to get some ice.

912
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,983
No, I'll get it for you.
Sit down and shut up!

913
00:56:35,009 --> 00:56:38,420
Sit down!

914
00:56:38,445 --> 00:56:39,954
I want you to get
your things,

915
00:56:39,978 --> 00:56:41,621
leave,
and don't come back.

916
00:56:41,646 --> 00:56:42,956
But, William--
No!

917
00:56:42,981 --> 00:56:45,291
Our deal for the 20th
is off.

918
00:56:45,315 --> 00:56:47,782
You're no longer
my driver.

919
00:57:42,902 --> 00:57:45,012
Shit. Fucker.

920
00:57:45,038 --> 00:57:46,813
Slow down, man.

921
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:50,574
Jesus Christ.

922
00:58:31,646 --> 00:58:32,922
<i>Bonjour, bijou.
Comment ça Va?</i>

923
00:58:32,947 --> 00:58:33,956
<i>ça Va?</i>

924
00:58:33,981 --> 00:58:34,958
Mom saw the letter.

925
00:58:34,983 --> 00:58:36,614
She doesn't want you
to come in.

926
00:58:38,418 --> 00:58:40,161
Did she open it?
No.

927
00:58:40,186 --> 00:58:41,661
What happened
to your eye?

928
00:58:41,686 --> 00:58:43,063
Oh. I just fell.

929
00:58:43,088 --> 00:58:44,130
It doesn't look
like you fell.

930
00:58:44,155 --> 00:58:45,954
Did someone hit you?

931
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:48,934
I miss you, Alex.

932
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:50,467
I do, too.

933
00:58:50,492 --> 00:58:51,670
I need to start going.

934
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:52,771
Wait, wait.
You don't want to know?

935
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:53,771
Yeah,
you can just text me!

936
00:58:53,797 --> 00:58:54,905
Good luck!

937
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:56,630
Bye, Alex.

938
00:59:31,697 --> 00:59:35,108
Hi, William.
It's me, Solo.

939
00:59:35,132 --> 00:59:39,277
I wanted to tell you I got
the results of my interview.

940
00:59:39,302 --> 00:59:42,748
William, I failed.

941
00:59:42,773 --> 00:59:45,317
I thought
you'd want to know.

942
00:59:45,342 --> 00:59:48,686
Yeah, you were clear,
but I thought you'd want--

943
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:50,210
Yeah, but--

944
01:00:06,594 --> 01:00:11,005
Come in, Cab 75. 75.

945
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:14,976
<i>75.</i>

946
01:00:15,001 --> 01:00:19,913
75, get 941. 941J.

947
01:00:19,938 --> 01:00:21,847
Holland Avenue.

948
01:00:21,873 --> 01:00:24,182
Alex, what are you
doing up so late?

949
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:26,952
What? Right now?

950
01:00:26,976 --> 01:00:28,585
I'm going to be there!
I'll be there right now!

951
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:30,186
Yo, Pork Chop, Pork Chop.

952
01:00:30,211 --> 01:00:31,789
Please, give me the keys.
Give me the keys for 64.

953
01:00:31,813 --> 01:00:33,724
What's wrong, Solo?
Yo, girl, I got to go!

954
01:00:33,748 --> 01:00:36,092
Please give me the keys, girl!
I can't do it.

955
01:00:36,117 --> 01:00:38,128
No, I'm not going
to do it.

956
01:00:38,152 --> 01:00:39,862
You need to calm down.
Yeah, I'm sorry.

957
01:00:39,887 --> 01:00:41,664
And don't be running up in
here, acting like that.

958
01:00:41,688 --> 01:00:42,864
I'm sorry.
Hey, give me the keys back.

959
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:45,088
I told you you couldn't
get the keys.

960
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:51,094
Hurry up, Solo.
Where were you?

961
01:00:52,297 --> 01:00:54,072
Hurry up!
How is she?

962
01:00:54,097 --> 01:00:55,907
She's fine. It's a boy.
It's a boy?

963
01:00:55,932 --> 01:00:56,909
Yes.
Oh, my God.

964
01:00:56,934 --> 01:00:58,110
Where is she?
Where is she?

965
01:00:58,135 --> 01:01:00,144
She's over there,
but I need to check in.

966
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:01,679
Over there?
This is my step-dad--

967
01:01:01,704 --> 01:01:02,880
Come on, let's go.
Is this Quiera Diop?

968
01:01:02,905 --> 01:01:04,248
Quiera Diop.
Yes, that hallway.

969
01:01:04,273 --> 01:01:05,681
Okay.

970
01:01:05,706 --> 01:01:07,215
Wow, how's the baby?
You see the baby?

971
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,284
<i>Ça Va?</i>

972
01:01:09,309 --> 01:01:11,085
I got a boy.

973
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:13,753
Uh-huh.

974
01:01:13,778 --> 01:01:14,855
Ah.

975
01:01:18,014 --> 01:01:20,181
Uh-huh.

976
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:29,632
Quiera, you all right?

977
01:01:29,657 --> 01:01:32,635
I told you a hundred times
we are both fine.

978
01:01:36,297 --> 01:01:38,007
I like that you speak
Spanish to him.

979
01:01:38,032 --> 01:01:39,875
He's going to grow up
speaking four languages.

980
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:42,309
And how is he supposed
to learn French and Wolof, huh?

981
01:01:42,335 --> 01:01:44,411
Tell me.

982
01:01:44,436 --> 01:01:46,679
I just don't understand.

983
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:48,782
I saw how happy you were
holding the baby

984
01:01:48,806 --> 01:01:50,849
in your hands just now.

985
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:52,351
You know we love you.

986
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:55,186
And you know that we want
what's best for you.

987
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,355
And I know you love us.

988
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,313
You can't leave.

989
01:02:07,789 --> 01:02:10,365
<i>Ça Va?</i>

990
01:02:10,391 --> 01:02:12,934
Solo, you have to trust me.

991
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,101
I wish you could
trust me, too.

992
01:02:14,126 --> 01:02:16,336
And that's the problem.

993
01:02:16,362 --> 01:02:17,670
Quiera,
you know I love you,

994
01:02:17,695 --> 01:02:19,739
and I'd do anything
for the family.

995
01:02:19,764 --> 01:02:21,673
But I've always
tried things your way,

996
01:02:21,699 --> 01:02:23,909
and you never
gave my way a chance.

997
01:02:23,934 --> 01:02:25,766
And I wish you can
understand that.

998
01:02:27,704 --> 01:02:29,847
I'm going to come back.

999
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:32,706
I'm going to call you to see if you
need anything else before I come.

1000
01:02:34,108 --> 01:02:35,842
Have a good night.

1001
01:03:44,909 --> 01:03:46,476
Hey, can I help you?

1002
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:50,155
Sir?

1003
01:03:50,179 --> 01:03:52,547
Hi.
Hey.

1004
01:03:57,085 --> 01:03:58,295
You work here, right?

1005
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,963
Excuse me?

1006
01:03:59,987 --> 01:04:02,364
You work at night.
Sometimes.

1007
01:04:02,389 --> 01:04:04,822
Would you like
to see a movie?

1008
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,603
Sir?

1009
01:04:09,628 --> 01:04:11,871
Do you know this old man
called William?

1010
01:04:11,896 --> 01:04:14,173
Excuse me, who are you
talking about?

1011
01:04:14,199 --> 01:04:15,507
We have some screenings
in an hour.

1012
01:04:15,532 --> 01:04:17,266
Would you like a ticket?

1013
01:04:19,335 --> 01:04:20,400
Sir?

1014
01:04:21,936 --> 01:04:24,313
Sir?
Sorry.

1015
01:04:24,338 --> 01:04:26,449
Forget about it.
Sorry about that.

1016
01:04:26,474 --> 01:04:27,972
Okay.

1017
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:56,409
6-4, 6-4.

1018
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,478
<i>Come on, Cab 64.</i>

1019
01:04:58,503 --> 01:05:01,581
Yo, Pork Chop, who's been to the
King's Inn Motel since yesterday?

1020
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:03,882
<i>Aw, come on now, 64.</i>

1021
01:05:03,907 --> 01:05:06,085
No, really, girl.
You got to help me out here.

1022
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:07,985
<i>34 picked that trip up.</i>

1023
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:10,320
<i>Mamadou.
A half an hour ago.</i>

1024
01:05:10,346 --> 01:05:13,289
Mamadou?
And where is he at?

1025
01:05:13,315 --> 01:05:16,559
<i>Around the Baptist area.</i>

1026
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:18,083
All right, 6-4 out.

1027
01:05:23,121 --> 01:05:26,365
3-4, 3-4, this is 6-4.

1028
01:05:26,391 --> 01:05:28,490
3-4, 6-4.

1029
01:05:30,027 --> 01:05:32,159
Mamadou, this is Solo.

1030
01:05:35,563 --> 01:05:39,132
3-4, 3-4,
this is 6-4.

1031
01:05:40,101 --> 01:05:43,201
3-4, 3-4, this is 6-4.

1032
01:05:45,871 --> 01:05:48,606
3-4, 3-4, 6-4.

1033
01:06:03,454 --> 01:06:05,264
Yo, 3-4, Mamadou.

1034
01:06:05,289 --> 01:06:07,634
This is Solo, 6-4.

1035
01:06:21,302 --> 01:06:22,411
Yo, Mamadou!

1036
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:24,280
Yo, pull over,
pull over!

1037
01:06:24,304 --> 01:06:27,483
Yo, Mamadou,
unroll your window.

1038
01:06:27,507 --> 01:06:28,550
What do you want?

1039
01:06:28,574 --> 01:06:30,351
I want to ask you
something.

1040
01:06:30,376 --> 01:06:31,967
Pull over! Pull over
right here, right here.

1041
01:06:31,992 --> 01:06:33,867
I can't do it, man.
I got customers in my car.

1042
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:37,456
Yo, I got to talk to you.
Mamadou, I got to talk to you.

1043
01:06:37,481 --> 01:06:39,981
All right, fine.
Follow me.

1044
01:06:58,467 --> 01:07:00,945
Hey, man, what's going on?
I got a trip, man.

1045
01:07:00,969 --> 01:07:02,579
Yo, I want to ask you
something real quick.

1046
01:07:02,603 --> 01:07:04,480
Listen, did you pick up
an old man 30 minutes ago

1047
01:07:04,505 --> 01:07:07,014
at the King's Inn Motel?
Yeah. So what?

1048
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:08,949
Did he offer you a trip
for tomorrow morning? No.

1049
01:07:08,974 --> 01:07:10,184
Yo, why are you lying, man?

1050
01:07:10,208 --> 01:07:11,418
What the fuck is going on?
What's going on?

1051
01:07:11,443 --> 01:07:13,286
Okay, whatever deal
you guys have is cancelled.

1052
01:07:13,311 --> 01:07:14,320
The deal is not
fucking cancelled.

1053
01:07:14,346 --> 01:07:15,688
Mamadou, the deal
is cancelled.

1054
01:07:15,713 --> 01:07:17,456
The man paid me
$200 deposit, man.

1055
01:07:17,481 --> 01:07:19,057
I don't give a shit
about his $200.

1056
01:07:19,083 --> 01:07:20,992
And plus, you see?
You're a fucking liar.

1057
01:07:21,018 --> 01:07:22,460
Are you calling me a fucking liar?
You're a liar!

1058
01:07:22,485 --> 01:07:23,994
Yo, Mamadou,
I'm talking to you, man.

1059
01:07:24,019 --> 01:07:25,663
Don't fucking grab me, man.
Yo, I'm talking to you--

1060
01:07:25,688 --> 01:07:27,498
Eh, man--
Yo--

1061
01:07:27,523 --> 01:07:28,931
Hey, come on, you guys.

1062
01:07:32,226 --> 01:07:34,469
Yo, Mamadou, I don't care
about the money, all right?

1063
01:07:34,494 --> 01:07:36,070
But you're going to tell me
where you dropped him.

1064
01:07:36,094 --> 01:07:37,737
Fuck you, man!
Come on, man.

1065
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:39,405
Mamadou, I swear you're going to
tell me where you dropped him.

1066
01:07:39,431 --> 01:07:41,608
Hey, man. Easy, easy.
Come on, chill out, man.

1067
01:07:41,632 --> 01:07:44,077
Come on, dawg. Mamadou,
where did you drop him?

1068
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:45,166
Hold on. Hold it, man.

1069
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:53,072
<i>5-8, 5-8.</i>

1070
01:08:25,137 --> 01:08:27,081
What do you want?

1071
01:08:27,105 --> 01:08:29,082
I'm here to take you
where you want to go.

1072
01:08:29,108 --> 01:08:31,484
Where's my driver?
I didn't ask for you.

1073
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:35,177
William, I'm here to take you
wherever you want to go.

1074
01:08:39,283 --> 01:08:40,748
Where to?

1075
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:45,653
The motel.

1076
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:06,451
William, I saw
the other driver

1077
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,386
and he canceled
the trip with you.

1078
01:09:08,411 --> 01:09:09,787
I'll take you
tomorrow morning.

1079
01:09:09,811 --> 01:09:11,610
That was our deal.

1080
01:09:20,554 --> 01:09:23,154
What time should
I pick you up?

1081
01:09:33,832 --> 01:09:36,199
8 a.m.

1082
01:11:59,307 --> 01:12:01,507
William.

1083
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:04,487
Good morning.

1084
01:12:04,511 --> 01:12:06,287
Morning.

1085
01:12:06,313 --> 01:12:07,788
Thank you.

1086
01:12:07,814 --> 01:12:11,081
You want to wash up?
Then we'll be leaving.

1087
01:13:29,025 --> 01:13:33,438
"I made a joke about
how bad a film was,

1088
01:13:33,462 --> 01:13:37,975
"and when he laughed,
his lip twitched.

1089
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,600
He looked
just like his mother."

1090
01:14:04,024 --> 01:14:06,100
"He's studying hard.

1091
01:14:06,126 --> 01:14:08,837
"I'm trying to help him
the best I can.

1092
01:14:08,862 --> 01:14:11,095
I think he will pass."

1093
01:14:41,594 --> 01:14:46,206
"I don't think Solo knows
that Alex fixed the curtains.

1094
01:14:46,230 --> 01:14:48,474
"She is so smart.

1095
01:14:48,498 --> 01:14:51,099
I wonder
who she will become."

1096
01:15:37,246 --> 01:15:38,988
Isn't that nice?

1097
01:15:39,014 --> 01:15:40,556
See? Almost new.

1098
01:15:40,582 --> 01:15:42,081
You like that?

1099
01:15:47,052 --> 01:15:49,130
It's very nice.

1100
01:15:49,154 --> 01:15:51,688
Thank you.

1101
01:16:06,738 --> 01:16:08,514
William, I have a favor.

1102
01:16:08,538 --> 01:16:10,939
I want Alex to come with us.
No.

1103
01:16:12,841 --> 01:16:15,185
William, I just can't
come back alone.

1104
01:16:15,211 --> 01:16:18,043
I can't believe
you're saying that. No.

1105
01:16:20,113 --> 01:16:23,024
I need Alex with me.

1106
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:24,916
Please allow me that.

1107
01:16:47,072 --> 01:16:48,782
Hi, William.
Hi, Solo.

1108
01:16:48,806 --> 01:16:49,849
Hi, Alex.

1109
01:16:49,873 --> 01:16:51,573
You ready?

1110
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,173
Come on, hurry up.

1111
01:19:10,845 --> 01:19:12,845
Hurry up, slowpokes.

1112
01:19:37,404 --> 01:19:39,381
Blowing Rock's this way!
Come on!

1113
01:19:39,405 --> 01:19:41,115
Hey, Alex, don't you want
some ice cream?

1114
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:42,750
No. I want to go
to Blowing Rock.

1115
01:19:42,774 --> 01:19:44,318
Yes, we will, but let's go
get some ice cream first.

1116
01:19:44,342 --> 01:19:45,418
They have cookies and
cream, you know.

1117
01:19:45,444 --> 01:19:46,920
They do?
Yeah.

1118
01:19:46,944 --> 01:19:49,922
Wow! Come on, William.
What are you going to get?

1119
01:19:49,948 --> 01:19:51,390
Alex, William has to
go meet a friend.

1120
01:19:51,416 --> 01:19:52,492
He's going to be late.

1121
01:19:52,516 --> 01:19:53,859
So let's go,
and we'll meet him later.

1122
01:19:53,885 --> 01:19:54,894
Are you sure?

1123
01:19:54,918 --> 01:19:57,095
Yes.

1124
01:19:57,121 --> 01:19:58,963
Okay.
Bye, William.

1125
01:19:58,988 --> 01:20:01,355
Bye, Alex.

1126
01:20:23,378 --> 01:20:25,177
Hurry up, Solo!

1127
01:20:29,382 --> 01:20:31,416
Solo, come on.

1128
01:20:40,792 --> 01:20:42,259
Come on.

1129
01:20:43,929 --> 01:20:46,528
Isn't this place
so pretty?

1130
01:20:49,332 --> 01:20:52,231
I'm going to get
two scoops of ice cream.

1131
01:22:27,895 --> 01:22:29,493
Pretty cool, huh?

1132
01:22:34,667 --> 01:22:36,510
Do you know if you throw
a stick off Blowing Rock,

1133
01:22:36,534 --> 01:22:37,543
it comes right back to you?

1134
01:22:37,569 --> 01:22:40,078
For real?
Yeah.

1135
01:22:40,104 --> 01:22:41,113
Oh, cool!
Come on, let's go.

1136
01:22:41,137 --> 01:22:43,314
We'll go later.
No, come on!

1137
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:44,582
Alex.

1138
01:22:44,606 --> 01:22:46,283
Come on.

1139
01:22:46,307 --> 01:22:47,984
Alex, wait.

1140
01:22:48,009 --> 01:22:49,385
Alex, wait.

1141
01:22:49,409 --> 01:22:51,141
Alex, come back.

1142
01:22:54,913 --> 01:22:57,091
Hurry up, Solo.

1143
01:22:57,115 --> 01:22:58,091
Watch out, Alex.

1144
01:22:58,117 --> 01:23:00,149
I don't want you
to fall down.

1145
01:23:05,588 --> 01:23:07,654
Hurry up, Solo.
There's Blowing Rock!

1146
01:23:10,592 --> 01:23:12,970
Hold on, hold on.
Watch out, watch out.

1147
01:23:12,994 --> 01:23:15,072
Hurry, up!

1148
01:23:21,135 --> 01:23:23,135
Hurry up, Solo.

1149
01:23:28,106 --> 01:23:29,672
Look, Solo, look!

1150
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:34,421
No.
But I want to see.

1151
01:23:34,445 --> 01:23:36,922
You're going to fall.
It's dangerous.

1152
01:23:36,948 --> 01:23:38,591
Then let me go get
another stick.

1153
01:23:38,615 --> 01:23:41,248
Yeah, but be
very careful, okay?

1154
01:25:04,630 --> 01:25:07,640
Hey, Alex, be careful,
be careful!

1155
01:25:07,666 --> 01:25:08,641
No, it's too dangerous.

1156
01:25:08,667 --> 01:25:09,676
I don't want you
to come here.

1157
01:25:09,701 --> 01:25:10,710
It's too dangerous.

1158
01:25:10,734 --> 01:25:13,301
Then here, Solo.
You throw it.

1159
01:25:57,243 --> 01:25:59,253
Is this your textbook?

1160
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:00,587
Yes.

1161
01:26:00,613 --> 01:26:03,346
Are you going to try again?

1162
01:26:04,483 --> 01:26:06,792
I think so.

1163
01:26:06,818 --> 01:26:09,384
Let me give you
a little quiz right here.

1164
01:26:11,755 --> 01:26:15,389
Let's see.
What is "XLV"?

1165
01:26:16,759 --> 01:26:20,470
Aw, come on, Solo.
I know you know it.

1166
01:26:20,496 --> 01:26:21,838
"Extra Life Vest."

1167
01:26:21,863 --> 01:26:23,340
You see?
You got it right.

1168
01:26:23,364 --> 01:26:25,240
Bravo!

1169
01:26:25,265 --> 01:26:26,832
Let me find
another one.

1170
01:26:29,203 --> 01:26:30,679
I'm sure you can
get this one.

1171
01:26:30,703 --> 01:26:33,314
"In the event
of a water evacuation,

1172
01:26:33,338 --> 01:26:38,217
what are the six steps
a flight attendant must take?"

1173
01:26:38,243 --> 01:26:41,154
Oh, come on, Solo,
I know you.

1174
01:26:41,179 --> 01:26:43,523
You can get them.

1175
01:26:43,547 --> 01:26:46,859
One, form a barrier.

1176
01:26:46,884 --> 01:26:50,362
Two, check conditions
and redirect

1177
01:26:50,386 --> 01:26:52,430
when exits are blocked.

1178
01:26:52,454 --> 01:26:57,368
Three, open exits
and inflate slides.

1179
01:26:57,393 --> 01:26:59,369
You're doing great
right now.

1180
01:26:59,395 --> 01:27:03,774
Four, when opening a door exit
to evacuate an aircraft,

1181
01:27:03,798 --> 01:27:06,676
rotate the handle
in the direction of the arrow

1182
01:27:06,701 --> 01:27:08,677
and open the door
forcefully enough

1183
01:27:08,703 --> 01:27:12,371
that it locks against
the side of the fuselage.
