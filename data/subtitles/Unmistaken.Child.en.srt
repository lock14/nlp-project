1
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:28,087
Before he died,
5 minutes before he passed away,

2
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,159
I was holding his hand

3
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,561
and requested him to
come back as a reincarnation.

4
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,436
Geshe-La replied that it all
depends on your all's prayers.

5
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,731
I know that Geshe-La
don't like me to cry,

6
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,534
but I just could not stop.

7
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,335
And Geshe-La said,

8
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,207
"Don't worry, don't cry.

9
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,008
"I have done everything in my life,

10
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,242
"I am totally satisfied with my life.

11
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:53,382
"Don't cry."

12
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,350
But still, I can't stop.

13
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,989
Look, pearl relics!

14
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,675
Oh, here, here.

15
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:41,658
- Tenzin Zopa, use both hands.
- Be careful, the ashes will fall in...

16
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,803
Oh, look here.
A pattern in the sand.

17
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:52,172
Now you can see it clearly.
What does it look like?

18
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,609
A footprint.

19
00:06:58,384 --> 00:06:59,942
Here, here.

20
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:05,114
It points to the east,
in this direction.

21
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:07,383
Dear Tenzin, we know you were
especially trusted by Geshe-La.

22
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:11,482
There was an unshakeable bond
between you,

23
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:16,094
and since you were little,
he took care of and nurtured you

24
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,253
right up until his death.

25
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:23,265
We must find his
unmistaken reincarnation,

26
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:27,198
someone who will continue
his kind deeds

27
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:30,068
and help all living beings. Right?

28
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:36,981
Therefore, you should take responsibility
for finding his reincarnation.

29
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:40,847
As you may know...

30
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:46,684
we checked the smoke
direction during the cremation

31
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:51,558
and the sand pattern
under the cremation pyre.

32
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:57,265
We were also told that
many pearl relics were found.

33
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,705
These are significant signs.

34
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:06,772
I personally informed
the Dalai Lama

35
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:11,550
and he said:
"If there are such clear signs,

36
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:16,848
"we can start looking
for the reincarnation."

37
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,198
I was, I mean, totally confused.

38
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:33,301
There is joy hearing that
Geshe-La would definitely return.

39
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,565
His Holiness already confirmed.

40
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:39,768
But when I hear that I have to be
the main person, I don't want.

41
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:47,980
I just cannot trust my feelings.
I'm not Buddha.

42
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,453
If something is a visible object,
of course you can see it,

43
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:57,187
but this is something that
you need to see its inner quality,

44
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,992
whether this is the same mind
of Lama Konchog or not.

45
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:05,995
But to know that,
only Buddhas know within Buddhas,

46
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:11,508
ordinary cannot judge
higher than your state.

47
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:55,043
Last night, I had
a very interesting dream.

48
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:59,122
It's Geshe Lama Konchog's holy body,

49
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,418
the dead body is lying outside.

50
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,688
And from Geshe Lama Konchog's

51
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:08,766
dead body, one little boy came out.

52
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,592
And he's like quite fatty-fatty

53
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,670
and quite small, you know?

54
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,500
So then he called my name:

55
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,609
"Tenzin Zopa, Tenzin Zopa,

56
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,211
"give me your hand."

57
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,714
So then I passed my hand.

58
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:27,449
You know the feeling in the dream

59
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,110
was so joyous

60
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:33,622
and suddenly with that joy,
I was waken up.

61
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,359
Swambhu Shrine.

62
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:14,029
This is east from Kopan.

63
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,295
Towards India?

64
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,534
It's here.

65
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:29,141
This mountain is the
"Snow Minister", Ganesh Himal.

66
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,119
Now the astrological check
will be done.

67
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,552
Should I send it to Taiwan?

68
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:44,890
Yes, today.

69
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:02,571
<i>For us, your disciples,
born from your holy teachings,</i>

70
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,875
<i>there is no other refuge than you.</i>

71
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,076
<i>How could you possibly
forsake us?</i>

72
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:11,621
<i>Come in your unmistaken
reincarnation to guide us.</i>

73
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:37,012
In one moment,
after Geshe-La passed away,

74
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,175
I got this very, very lost feeling.

75
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:43,483
Almost like I want
to give up many things,

76
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,685
just don't know what to do,
and like...

77
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:50,295
Because I never planned
for my life, you see.

78
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,464
Everything was planned
by Geshe-La:

79
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,527
"You are going to do this,
you'll do that."

80
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:59,797
So I always say "yes",
just follow,

81
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:03,567
and I didn't think at all
about what is going to happen next.

82
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:34,169
- Heruka Center.
- Yes, in Taiwan.

83
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,541
- Oh, Lobsang Jamyang.
- Yes.

84
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,824
- You see...
- What it means?

85
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:06,431
My astrology check
pointed to three options,

86
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:12,397
but one of them is much more
significant than the others.

87
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:19,342
I checked for the reincarnation's
birthplace and the father's name.

88
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,981
What came out,
with a probability of 95%,

89
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,814
is that the father's name
begins with the letter "A".

90
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:34,025
You have to search for a father
whose name starts with "A".

91
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:40,031
As for the reincarnation's birthplace,

92
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,261
the syllable "TS" came out.

93
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:50,073
As you know, Geshe-La meditated
for years in Tsum Valley.

94
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:55,736
Most probably,
the child was born in that area.

95
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:06,291
Tsum Valley is my birthplace,
where I was born.

96
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:12,393
During that time Geshe-La
already moved to his third cave,

97
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:17,160
which is about an hour from
my village, up in the mountains.

98
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,972
Always, he's always like this,
you see, always...

99
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:29,478
Huge and, you know,
long ears, laughing.

100
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:35,351
Yeah, I used to be with him like this.

101
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,494
I truly believe

102
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:51,034
that his reincarnation has come.

103
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:56,740
However, there is a possibility
of finding a mistaken one

104
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,276
if the disciples lack merits.

105
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:05,407
Therefore, you should be
careful and meticulous.

106
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:09,313
You don't have the power to say:

107
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,683
"This is the true reincarnation

108
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:12,789
"or not."

109
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:16,321
So don't trust
everything people say,

110
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:19,225
don't take everything as true,

111
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,993
as people will tell you
many unusual stories.

112
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:27,264
If someone is labeled
as the reincarnation

113
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:31,205
and turns out
to be a strange character,

114
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,434
then all becomes strange,
and such things have happened.

115
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,776
- Please, Tenzin Zopa.
- You don't need to offer me.

116
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:52,581
- Please accept this.
- No need, give to the others.

117
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,752
- Oh, thank you.
- Good to see you again.

118
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,686
How kind of you,
thank you very much.

119
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,639
Hello, how are you?

120
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,706
Hello. Oh, thank you.

121
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:57,414
Have people here said anything

122
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:00,242
about his reincarnation?

123
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:09,120
We do pray for his reincarnation,

124
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:12,821
but the most important thing

125
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:17,861
is that the High Lamas
search and test.

126
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:22,399
We don't have clairvoyance
or realizations.

127
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:30,236
Please ask the High Lamas

128
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:33,215
to search for him.

129
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:36,713
So we can see him again.

130
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:45,724
You are his closest disciple.

131
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:49,025
When I see you,
he appears in my mind.

132
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,431
I miss him.

133
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:34,635
- Brother, where are you from?
- From Lokpa.

134
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,043
I see.
Is this the right way to Chulae?

135
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:40,877
- Yes, it's over there.
- OK.

136
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:52,019
Sister, where are you from?

137
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:55,022
- From Chulae.
- Chulae. I see.

138
00:23:55,333 --> 00:24:00,100
In Chulae, are there any children
aged one to one and a half?

139
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:04,439
There are many children,
but I don't know.

140
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:10,578
However, nowadays people are...
you know...

141
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,144
You'll have to
see for yourself, brother.

142
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,548
OK, thank you.

143
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,232
Child. Come, come.

144
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,235
Here's a toffee.

145
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,736
What's your name?

146
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:17,278
Tsering Dhondup.

147
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,474
What's your father's name?

148
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:23,051
- Choepel.
- Choepel, OK.

149
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:27,658
Give one to your brother.

150
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:31,487
- Do you recognize this rosary?
- Yes.

151
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,827
Is it yours?

152
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:36,092
- Yes?
- A rosary.

153
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:40,168
Um... Is this Uncle's or yours?

154
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,034
- Uncle's.
- Uncle's? OK.

155
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,074
Touch your forehead.

156
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:27,211
Hello. How do you do?

157
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:29,816
Brother, come inside.

158
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:39,323
- What is his name?
- Him? Nyima Tseten.

159
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:40,829
- Nyima Tseten.
- Yes.

160
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,432
Nyima Tseten.
Are you Nyima Tseten?

161
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:49,102
For long life.

162
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,606
Want a balloon?

163
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,853
What's your name?

164
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:05,553
Nyima Tseten.

165
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,221
Oh, he isn't moving.

166
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,024
Like a yogi!

167
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,090
Do you recognize this?

168
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,567
He's smiling.

169
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,004
See you again, OK?

170
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:33,082
- Stay well.
- Thank you.

171
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:42,554
Any children aged one
to one and a half here?

172
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:46,720
Chulae, I see.
Pangdun is down there?

173
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:48,490
Chulae... Nyiloe...

174
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:52,529
OK. Thank you.

175
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,902
Touch your forehead.

176
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,872
Do you want to become a monk?

177
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,578
Do you want?

178
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:03,003
Can you recite the Mani Mantra?

179
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,108
I don't know.

180
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,506
I don't know. I don't know.

181
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,044
Don't know. Don't know.

182
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:34,535
He has long ears
and a wide forehead too.

183
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:38,101
He looks very fortunate and lucky.

184
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,734
What a cute boy!

185
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:46,177
<i>May my venerable
Lama's life be firm,</i>

186
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:49,184
<i>Dispelling the darkness
of all beings in the three realms.</i>

187
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:54,154
<i>In all my future lives,
never separated from perfect gurus.</i>

188
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:58,318
<i>May I enjoy
the magnificent teachings.</i>

189
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:03,534
Do you recognize it?

190
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,512
Between one and one and a half?

191
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:59,248
Tsering Paljor has a son of that age.

192
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,686
- I see.
- He's one.

193
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:05,785
- One and a half?
- No, he's not yet one.

194
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:08,160
- Not yet one?
- Right.

195
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:30,321
Hello, come in.

196
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,617
Son, sit up there. - It's OK here.

197
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:40,860
He is truly very good and obedient.

198
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,568
When her daughter was born,
several people helped.

199
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:52,670
But when this boy was born,
only her husband was there.

200
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:54,669
I see.

201
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,939
- An easy delivery, no?
- I see.

202
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,648
Before his birth,

203
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,547
I dreamt that I was herding cows

204
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,051
near Geshe-La's retreat.

205
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:07,485
The dream was very clear.

206
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,059
She was pregnant
when she had this dream.

207
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:14,089
OK, come.

208
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:18,635
You want to go?
Hey, he said no.

209
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,761
Such attitude.

210
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:36,014
What is this?
Do you recognize it?

211
00:33:54,332 --> 00:34:00,134
In summer time, there will be a very,
very beautiful blue flower.

212
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:03,968
Blue, and the entire area will be
covered with flowers, even this.

213
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,870
All these are actually flower trees.

214
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:10,544
White, green, blue, yellow...
all different types.

215
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:13,280
And even these bamboo trees

216
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,615
will be more green,
and like, then windy...

217
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:19,848
And after that everything,
everyone is dancing.

218
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:24,424
Everybody will dance.
Every nature tree will dance.

219
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:27,890
The waterfall will dance,
trees will dance, you see here?

220
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,194
Dancing, dancing.
This is dancing.

221
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,901
Free dance.

222
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,269
Like this flower.

223
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:43,210
So beautiful, happy and free.

224
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:47,376
But sorry anyway, I...
I took permission from the tree.

225
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:48,982
So that's why I'm taking it.

226
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,214
Actually now it's not free,
before it was free.

227
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,535
I remember that
since the age of 3,

228
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,801
I used to run up to
Geshe Lama Konchog's cave up there.

229
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:20,874
So I usually run from
that juniper tree, up to...

230
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,114
Like this.

231
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,683
Day after day
and month after month,

232
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:32,261
even when it was snowing
I came up.

233
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,359
And my family put a full effort.

234
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:39,363
They tried separating me
from Geshe La.

235
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:44,300
They want me to be a householder,
they want me to get married.

236
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,807
This is at the age of 6 and 7,

237
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:49,004
they had already found
a girl for me.

238
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,977
I am totally not interested in this.

239
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,620
So then, one day I really
screamed at my father:

240
00:35:56,854 --> 00:36:01,450
"Just let me see him, and I will
ask one last question:

241
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:04,290
'Geshe-La, can you accept me?

242
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:06,990
'Can you let me follow you? '

243
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,959
"If Geshe-La says 'no',

244
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:11,001
"I would never ever ask again,

245
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:12,796
"and I will follow Papa,

246
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:17,270
"but if Geshe-La says 'yes',
no one can stop me."

247
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:49,501
Nothing, nothing.

248
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:52,507
Nothing left but still,
I don't know,

249
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,907
due to Geshe-La's prayer,

250
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,809
he loved flowers so much,
rose flowers are left.

251
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,848
So many, you know,
so many about to come.

252
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:02,948
It will be beautiful.
Definitely that is the same flower.

253
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:06,085
It's 100% of...
200% sure.

254
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:11,720
I always plucked a flower
and quietly put on his ear.

255
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:16,329
Just like before, pluck flower,
and Geshe-La was meditating,

256
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:19,731
so I slowly put on his ear

257
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:24,506
and he doesn't bother.
Later on, when I sleep,

258
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:27,008
sometimes he slowly
put on my ear, like that.

259
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,757
It used to be beautiful.

260
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,919
I mean, the outward appearance
used to be beautiful,

261
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,222
but now everything is gone.

262
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,897
It's like...

263
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:49,783
Last time...

264
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:06,988
He insists to become a monk

265
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:09,598
and doesn't want to go to school.

266
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:14,370
Do you want to become a monk?

267
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,711
No.

268
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,511
Do you want to become a monk?

269
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:27,340
Do you want to become a monk?

270
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,753
What should I say?

271
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:37,127
Maybe, from Phurpae up to Nyiloe...

272
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:40,392
Did you hear of any unusual children?

273
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:43,761
I have not heard about anyone

274
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:46,232
with unusual signs.

275
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:50,065
You don't know any?

276
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:53,008
I haven't met any child

277
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,168
with an interest in the teachings.

278
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,577
Haven't seen... I see.

279
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:04,648
Hello. How are you?

280
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,551
Are you from Laeru or Ngagyu?

281
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,215
- You mean us?
- Yes.

282
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:10,519
We are from Choekhang.

283
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,822
- From Choekhang, I see.
- Grandpa Wangchuk...

284
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:15,966
I see. That's right...

285
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:22,305
- Is your farm over here?
- We are relatives, right?

286
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:28,844
I was away for a long time,
I slightly recognize Auntie's face.

287
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:33,006
In Ngagyu, do you know any kids

288
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:38,319
aged one to one and a half?

289
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:41,049
Maybe Ahpe.

290
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,783
- Ahpe...
- Ahpe has.

291
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:49,261
- Small kids, right?
- Yes, small.

292
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,699
- Over there is...
- There?

293
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:57,272
- Behind that one.
- I see.

294
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:59,306
Yes, behind that.

295
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:02,502
Is his son one or two?

296
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,839
He has two sons.

297
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:08,573
- One is not yet one.
- About one.

298
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,282
I see.

299
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:15,282
- Is there a way out from there?
- Yes.

300
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,222
Go that way.

301
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,639
Hello.

302
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:40,183
- What is the boy's name?
- Tsering Bhuti.

303
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:45,088
- His father's name?
- Yes?

304
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:46,745
Father's name?

305
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:50,121
- Ngodrup Gyaltsen.
- I see. Thank you.

306
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:09,011
Hello.

307
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:11,743
Where is Ahpe's house?

308
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,750
- Ahpe's house?
- There.

309
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,045
Over there?

310
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:44,498
Here, here. OK, take it.

311
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:02,790
Give me, give me.

312
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,790
Give me the rosary.

313
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,190
Is this yours?

314
00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:59,008
Don't.

315
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:01,878
Give it to me.

316
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,949
<i>In all my lives,
never separated from perfect gurus,</i>

317
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:41,744
<i>May I enjoy the magnificent teachings.</i>

318
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,046
<i>By completing the qualities
of the stages and paths,</i>

319
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:47,782
<i>May I quickly attain the state
of Vajradhara Buddha.</i>

320
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:53,854
Finally, I left without
getting the rosary back.

321
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:56,015
He kept it.

322
00:49:56,259 --> 00:50:00,559
- What did Geshe-La use his rosary for?
- For his morning ritual.

323
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:03,495
- I see. A crystal one?
- Yes.

324
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:07,602
Also, there was an apple tree
which was planted by Geshe-La,

325
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:09,932
it's now huge and bears fruit.

326
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:13,770
He has been watering it
every morning for the last year.

327
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:15,411
Oh yeah.

328
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:18,209
Seems like quite a unique child.

329
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:22,148
Since you were very close
to Geshe-La

330
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,688
and well acquainted
with his nature,

331
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:30,953
your inquiries
are very meaningful.

332
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:35,254
Tell both Rinpoches
about this, OK?

333
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:40,334
And we will come
and do more checks.

334
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:43,962
For now,
the boy should be kept clean.

335
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:46,575
Please keep him clean.

336
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:53,616
If we get more assurance,
then we will inform

337
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:57,951
His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.

338
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,121
Right?

339
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:10,833
To find the unmistaken
reincarnation of Lama Konchog,

340
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:13,469
this is my life's responsibility.

341
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:18,030
It's not just a responsibility
of just being an attendant,

342
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:22,007
it's a responsibility for
a very, very important person,

343
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,841
who is going to benefit
numberless beings.

344
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,274
Just, just, just...

345
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:30,784
Just having him itself,

346
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:33,855
just able to bring,
even if he is a baby,

347
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:36,322
I can bring him
and I can show to you.

348
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:40,027
I can show to people.
Just that itself, already is enough.

349
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:42,263
It's very important.

350
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:46,127
It's thousands and thousands
of times more important

351
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,134
than my own life.

352
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,065
Who is this?

353
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:27,000
A child.

354
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:30,078
A child. Who is he?

355
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,304
Yes?

356
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:40,783
Do you recognize him?
Tell me. Who is he?

357
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:44,288
- Is it you?
- Who is he?

358
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,818
Is it Big Uncle?

359
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,625
- Yes, it is Big Uncle.
- Is this Tenzin Ngodup?

360
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,964
Yes, this is Tenzin Ngodup.

361
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:54,330
Who is that?

362
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,438
It's Grandma...

363
00:52:56,973 --> 00:52:58,838
Is that her?

364
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:02,035
Yes, it is Grandma.

365
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,655
I'll spray you.

366
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:20,759
Wait, wait...

367
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:32,594
Tenzin Zopa, you are called.

368
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:38,239
Come. Come.

369
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:47,043
Here. Prostrate like me.

370
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:52,478
Little boy, come here.

371
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,851
Let us begin.

372
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:44,870
Tell him to choose the bell
he used in his previous life.

373
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:50,645
Do you want to pick up your bell?
Yes?

374
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:57,784
Tell him to take the one
that he used before.

375
00:55:57,954 --> 00:56:00,354
Ahpe, you tell him.

376
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:03,390
Tell him in his mother tongue.

377
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,927
Take the one you used before.

378
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:11,658
My little boy,

379
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:15,304
you are very obedient, right?

380
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:20,374
This one.

381
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:27,109
Right, that is the one.

382
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:32,520
Then? Next.

383
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:36,319
Which one?

384
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:37,983
This one.

385
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:42,020
Yes, that's right.

386
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:51,002
Now the rosary.

387
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:56,841
Which one?
This, this or this?

388
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:02,609
- Pick the one you used before.
- In your past life.

389
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,881
This.

390
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:13,652
Hand drum.

391
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:17,626
Now your hand drum.

392
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:21,964
Which one?

393
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:24,499
Not this one... this.

394
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:27,507
- Which one?
- This.

395
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:32,971
Ask him. Is this the one?

396
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:34,980
It is.

397
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:38,416
- He said it is.
- I see, that's good.

398
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:43,322
- Which one, this?
- Yes.

399
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:45,723
- This one?
- No.

400
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:47,262
Yes.

401
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:53,126
He picked the right one.

402
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:51,649
Thank you. What is your name?

403
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:53,553
Your name?

404
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:22,047
Don't go.

405
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:31,532
<i>Lama Yopa Rinpoche got
a good impression</i>

406
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:35,836
<i>and decided to write a letter
to His Holiness the Dalai Lama.</i>

407
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:39,475
In order to make very precious,

408
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:41,667
he wants the Dalai Lama to announce,

409
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:43,175
Dalai Lama to recognize.

410
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:45,973
So that's why Rinpoche has already
sent the name to Dalai Lama.

411
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:47,139
To check.

412
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:49,080
Both Rinpoches said,

413
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:53,449
even though he stays in family
for the moment, keep clean.

414
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:56,424
Keep clean... like that.

415
00:59:56,593 --> 01:00:01,929
So today is one of the
shaking days for my life.

416
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:19,632
I want to go to Grandma Lhamo.

417
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:44,989
So this is the letter.

418
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,671
A letter from the Dalai Lama.

419
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:51,165
It was sealed by His Holiness.

420
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:54,068
"I received a request from

421
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:57,212
"the devoted Lama Zopa Rinpoche,

422
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,247
"on behalf of his monasteries.

423
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:04,216
"To check the reincarnation candidate

424
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,480
"of the late Lama Konchog

425
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:10,790
"Accordingly,
I conducted checks and tests.

426
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:17,793
"Therefore, with a comfortable mind
and very good divination,

427
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:22,632
"I recognize Tenzin Ngodrup

428
01:02:22,805 --> 01:02:26,741
"as the reincarnation
of Gen Lama Konchog.

429
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:30,271
"Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso,

430
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:32,607
"a monk of the Shakyamuni tradition.

431
01:02:32,782 --> 01:02:35,012
"17th December 2005."

432
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:44,054
So, this is it.

433
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:49,062
His Holiness wants to see him,
so we must be ready.

434
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:05,334
Sit still.

435
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:11,775
Sit still and it won't hurt.

436
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:14,746
Don't cut my hair. Don't cut.

437
01:04:17,253 --> 01:04:18,652
Don't move, OK?

438
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:21,222
I want to wash my head.

439
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:26,487
You are not allowing me
to wash, Big Uncle.

440
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:29,294
Ani's shirt got dirty, didn't it?

441
01:04:29,932 --> 01:04:32,492
Your shirt is not dirty.

442
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:35,835
Don't move your head. Don't cry.

443
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:03,621
More water.

444
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:05,691
Wait a moment, OK?

445
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:10,037
Wait, we will wet it.

446
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:14,332
Catch with your hands.

447
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:16,408
Catch the hair with your hands.

448
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,308
It's falling on the ground.

449
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:20,311
My eyes are burning.

450
01:05:20,483 --> 01:05:22,951
I will wipe your eyes. OK?

451
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:28,052
Aren't you a good boy?

452
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:30,454
Don't cut. Wash.

453
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:32,055
Are your eyes burning?

454
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:35,220
Don't cut, don't.

455
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:38,999
OK, nearly finished.

456
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:41,396
Wait. Don't cut.

457
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,805
Don't cut. - Wait.

458
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,504
Wait, wait.

459
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:58,812
It's almost done... almost.

460
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:03,018
Come to Uncle.

461
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,251
I want to go.

462
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:15,433
Where do you want to go?

463
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:23,003
Does it burn?

464
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:33,386
Don't you want to shave
before Grandma Lhamo arrives?

465
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:39,127
Shave the rest. Then when Grandma
arrives, you'll be clean shaven.

466
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:46,999
We will quietly shave in the tent.

467
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:49,160
Quietly in the tent.

468
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:12,946
- Welcome.
- He looks very fresh and clean.

469
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:39,848
In reality we must begin
by contemplating the teachings:

470
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:44,246
Consider whether it is possible
to become a Buddha

471
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:49,322
who is free from faults
and full of perfect virtues.

472
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:55,520
<i>In general, liberation,</i>

473
01:08:55,698 --> 01:09:00,601
<i>including the highest virtue
of omniscience, is a possibility.</i>

474
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:07,138
When you recite: "In order
to benefit sentient beings",

475
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:11,143
you are not aspiring
to become a Buddha

476
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:15,272
<i>or to have happiness,
with a selfish motive.</i>

477
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:21,281
In fact, you are praying
to become a source for everyone

478
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:24,991
to have inexhaustible
well-being and happiness.

479
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:43,942
Zopa Rinpoche will go

480
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:46,775
and then we will go together.

481
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:13,269
Welcome, welcome, Rinpoche.

482
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:23,180
Here. Here. Like this.

483
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:30,051
OK, do it like this.
It's OK.

484
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:34,655
Now I will put it there.

485
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:38,357
It's alright. You can keep it.

486
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:47,265
There is no tuft on his crown!

487
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:49,308
Never mind, never mind.

488
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:52,475
Oh, like that.

489
01:10:57,886 --> 01:10:59,444
It's OK now.

490
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:07,623
New name...

491
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:10,094
- What was his former name?
- Tenzin Ngodrup.

492
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:12,923
Was it Tenzin Ngodrup?

493
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:15,161
Lama Konchog
was called Lobsang Phuntsok.

494
01:11:15,337 --> 01:11:16,895
Lobsang Phuntsok.

495
01:11:17,072 --> 01:11:21,168
In his previous life.
His current name is Tenzin Ngodrup.

496
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:23,311
What was his name before?

497
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:26,141
- Gen Lama...
- What was his name?

498
01:11:26,315 --> 01:11:29,250
- Lobsang Phuntsok.
- Lobsang Phuntsok, right?

499
01:11:29,718 --> 01:11:31,310
That's right.

500
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:37,690
Then let's say Tenzin...

501
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:43,792
Then let's say Tenzin Phuntsok.

502
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:47,330
Now your new name is Tenzin Phuntsok.

503
01:11:47,503 --> 01:11:50,404
Understand?
You have changed your body

504
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:52,597
and your new name is Tenzin Phuntsok.

505
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:54,902
Become a perfect holder
of the teachings.

506
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:57,705
Understand? It's OK now.

507
01:12:13,228 --> 01:12:15,560
Where is Grandma?

508
01:12:15,731 --> 01:12:17,824
Let's see if she is there.

509
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:19,825
Tenzin Ngodrup...

510
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,799
I mean,
Tenzin Phuntsok Rinpoche.

511
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:23,701
Tenzin Phuntsok Rinpoche.

512
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,431
He is going to see his parents

513
01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:01,769
this afternoon,

514
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:04,069
maybe at late evening.

515
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:07,939
They will know
that he was recognized

516
01:13:08,117 --> 01:13:10,381
as a reincarnated Lama

517
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:12,713
and they have to consider

518
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:14,947
whether they can give Rinpoche,

519
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:16,920
give up to the monastery.

520
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:24,422
So I hope and I pray that
they will definitely agree,

521
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:30,402
because they have great respect for
the previous Geshe Lama Konchog.

522
01:13:38,947 --> 01:13:41,916
- There, there.
- Yes.

523
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:31,599
Buddha. Buddha.

524
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:05,161
See how he closes his eyes.

525
01:15:11,773 --> 01:15:13,900
What shall we do now?

526
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:17,940
Tell him not to cry.

527
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:22,206
- Shall I cry?
- You will not cry.

528
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:26,514
You are a Lama,
you will not cry.

529
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:33,519
The cow kicked me.

530
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:36,630
Kicked me with its legs.

531
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:40,098
I see.

532
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:47,370
Oh. What if I fall off?

533
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:51,102
I am here now...

534
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:55,312
Be careful. Get up.

535
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:16,833
- Where is the retreat?
- Up there.

536
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:19,667
- Where?
- The flags up there.

537
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:26,674
Up there, that is the one.

538
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:28,839
That one.

539
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:40,124
Big Uncle, you come here.

540
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:48,335
- From here.
- Yes?

541
01:16:48,503 --> 01:16:50,562
- Up this way?
- Yes.

542
01:16:56,945 --> 01:17:00,210
Dad will come up now.

543
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:12,859
Where is it coming from?

544
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:15,956
Oh, I think it is flu.

545
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:25,201
Wait.

546
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:29,002
- How should I wipe it?
- Wait.

547
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:34,815
- Wipe it at the retreat.
- What?

548
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:36,314
At the retreat.

549
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:39,386
- At the retreat?
- Yes.

550
01:17:39,554 --> 01:17:40,885
Wait, wait.

551
01:17:41,123 --> 01:17:44,149
Look up, blood is coming out.

552
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:46,088
If I look up?

553
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:48,252
Then the blood won't come.

554
01:17:48,764 --> 01:17:50,356
Don't do it.

555
01:17:50,799 --> 01:17:53,324
I am going to find some herbs.

556
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:55,060
Hold him.

557
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:03,034
Wait, wait.

558
01:18:07,015 --> 01:18:08,983
Now Dad will come.

559
01:18:12,421 --> 01:18:14,719
- What is the medicine?
- What?

560
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:18,449
What is it?

561
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:20,928
- Sangkhanpa.
- I see.

562
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:22,791
We need to rub it? Wait.

563
01:18:22,964 --> 01:18:24,761
Put it up his nose.

564
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,901
- It's too much.
- Put it all in.

565
01:18:36,244 --> 01:18:38,735
- Don't do too much.
- Wait.

566
01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:41,212
Don't do too much.

567
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:46,981
- Now let's go.
- Go down?

568
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:49,749
No... to the retreat.

569
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:52,184
To the retreat.

570
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,188
Let's go.

571
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:13,912
My retreat. My retreat.

572
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:40,774
I need a white scarf.

573
01:19:42,911 --> 01:19:44,105
I need a white scarf.

574
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:46,372
- White scarf?
- Yes.

575
01:20:23,385 --> 01:20:25,853
How did this hole get here?

576
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:40,799
Now there is a way to go.

577
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:43,368
Now it's very good.

578
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:49,065
You had a big body
and I was very small.

579
01:20:49,611 --> 01:20:53,707
Come here, I will show you.

580
01:20:54,883 --> 01:20:57,647
We used to sit like this.
You recited:

581
01:20:57,819 --> 01:21:00,982
<i>May the supreme jewel Bodhicitta
not arisen, arise and grow;</i>

582
01:21:01,156 --> 01:21:04,125
<i>That arisen not diminish,
But increase more and more.</i>

583
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:04,986
More and more...

584
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:06,023
Then what?

585
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:08,458
<i>Lobsang Drakpa,
at your feet I make requests.</i>

586
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:10,756
We used to sit like this.

587
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:14,561
All these flowers were planted
by you.

588
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:18,938
I will repair everything
for Rinpoche, OK?

589
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:21,667
- That?
- I will repair that too.

590
01:21:21,843 --> 01:21:24,073
- All?
- I will repair them all.

591
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:25,406
That one?

592
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:29,983
I will fix them all
and build a wooden fence,

593
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:35,020
then you will recite prayers and
do meditation here again, right?

594
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:37,850
I want to stay here.

595
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:41,293
I want to stay in Tsum forever.

596
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:14,051
Lama Ngodrup.

597
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:16,988
Lama Ngodrup.

598
01:22:17,866 --> 01:22:20,027
Your father is calling you.

599
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:33,874
Slowly, slowly.

600
01:22:39,521 --> 01:22:45,323
This is the letter of confirmation
from the Dalai Lama

601
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:49,088
recognizing your son,
Tenzin Ngodrup,

602
01:22:49,264 --> 01:22:52,700
as the unmistaken reincarnation
of Lama Konchog.

603
01:22:53,068 --> 01:22:56,367
His Holiness not only
sent this letter,

604
01:22:56,538 --> 01:23:01,407
but also did his
hair-cutting ceremony

605
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:06,838
and gave him a new name,
Tenzin Phuntsok Rinpoche.

606
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:12,583
As a Rinpoche, he has to go to

607
01:23:12,754 --> 01:23:16,747
Kopan or Sera Monastery. Right?

608
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:21,792
Will I get to see him?

609
01:23:21,963 --> 01:23:24,989
I am not sure
if I will ever get to see him.

610
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:30,101
When someone is a Lama, he has

611
01:23:30,271 --> 01:23:33,331
to be taken away to a monastery.

612
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:37,202
He is taken away even though

613
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:40,314
he is a family member.

614
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:41,542
We don't know when

615
01:23:41,716 --> 01:23:43,206
he will return home.

616
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:46,080
I think it would be difficult

617
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:48,246
for him to return.

618
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:55,257
It would be difficult even to see him.

619
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:58,363
So how do you two,

620
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:01,502
father and mother, feel...

621
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:06,606
about your child... your child...

622
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:13,242
being taken away to the monastery?

623
01:24:13,415 --> 01:24:16,213
How do you feel about that?

624
01:24:18,019 --> 01:24:19,953
So what do you feel?

625
01:24:20,121 --> 01:24:23,215
- I don't feel...
- You don't...

626
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:26,751
If he was an ordinary boy,

627
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:30,625
he would marry
and work in the fields.

628
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:34,064
But he is a reincarnated master

629
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:39,898
who was revered all over the world
and had many students.

630
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:45,903
Your son, Tenzin Ngodrup,
should assume those responsibilities.

631
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:51,343
So do you think
you can give the child up?

632
01:24:54,722 --> 01:24:57,953
Yes, I can.

633
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:09,627
It seems Ahpe is not ready to give...

634
01:25:12,907 --> 01:25:18,743
If he works for the benefit
of sentient beings,

635
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:23,945
then I can give my child up.

636
01:25:24,085 --> 01:25:28,112
Otherwise, who could give up
his child for nothing?

637
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:30,891
Thank you.

638
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:03,054
Oh my!

639
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:11,189
How fortunate we are.
Where is Mochung?

640
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:14,457
Oh, my Mochung.

641
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:20,167
We had no information.
We did not know.

642
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:29,109
One piece, that's enough.

643
01:27:07,689 --> 01:27:09,054
He is so cute.

644
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:10,652
I'm falling down.

645
01:27:10,825 --> 01:27:13,419
No, I will hold you.

646
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:26,533
Oh, Grandpa. Bend your head.

647
01:27:29,277 --> 01:27:32,269
Thank you. Bend your head.

648
01:27:35,483 --> 01:27:38,543
May we meet our master
again and again.

649
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:56,495
<i>The glorious Lama.
If he is not the wish-fulfilling jewel,</i>

650
01:27:59,574 --> 01:28:02,771
<i>then who is?</i>

651
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:06,970
Have a safe journey.

652
01:30:58,820 --> 01:31:01,653
Welcome.

653
01:32:05,653 --> 01:32:11,353
<i>I imagine this as a Buddha field
and offer it.</i>

654
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:18,162
You don't have to touch them all...

655
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:26,567
Rinpoche, touch your head.

656
01:35:15,242 --> 01:35:17,301
Rinpoche, your bed is ready.

657
01:35:36,997 --> 01:35:39,329
What does it look like?

658
01:35:49,677 --> 01:35:51,269
Mommy, are you leaving now?

659
01:35:51,445 --> 01:35:52,776
Yes, Mommy is leaving.

660
01:35:52,947 --> 01:35:55,677
- Daddy?
- Daddy is leaving too.

661
01:35:55,850 --> 01:35:57,681
Daddy, don't go.

662
01:36:02,656 --> 01:36:07,491
Be good.
Behave for Big Uncle, OK?

663
01:36:09,363 --> 01:36:14,164
Come, let's see them off.

664
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:18,170
Where are we going?

665
01:36:18,339 --> 01:36:20,569
Wait, put a scarf on your daddy.

666
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:21,969
Then where am I going?

667
01:36:22,309 --> 01:36:23,799
To Grandma's place?

668
01:36:23,978 --> 01:36:25,969
We can go later, OK?

669
01:36:26,347 --> 01:36:29,282
I am going to Grandma's place.

670
01:36:35,523 --> 01:36:37,957
Touch your forehead.

671
01:36:38,859 --> 01:36:42,955
I am going to Grandma Lhamo's place.

672
01:36:46,634 --> 01:36:49,831
I am going with Mommy.

673
01:36:52,106 --> 01:36:53,596
Touch my head.

674
01:36:53,941 --> 01:36:56,876
To Tsering, touch lightly.

675
01:36:57,178 --> 01:36:59,544
- To you?
- Strongly.

676
01:37:00,181 --> 01:37:02,581
Bye-bye.

677
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:04,079
Bye-bye.

678
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:06,685
Where are we going now?

679
01:37:07,021 --> 01:37:10,548
Now they are not staying here?

680
01:37:14,595 --> 01:37:17,462
Come back soon.

681
01:37:21,802 --> 01:37:23,497
Don't let them go.

682
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:27,767
Now I have no friends.
I have no friends.

683
01:37:28,676 --> 01:37:31,509
Don't let them go.

684
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:36,309
You, don't let them go.

685
01:37:43,057 --> 01:37:45,685
You, don't let them go.

686
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:47,887
I'm going.

687
01:37:48,062 --> 01:37:49,962
Do you really want to go?

688
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:52,064
I really want to go.

689
01:37:52,233 --> 01:37:54,895
Put on your robe properly.

690
01:38:02,643 --> 01:38:05,237
Don't let them go.

691
01:39:25,359 --> 01:39:27,020
Rinpoche.

692
01:39:37,438 --> 01:39:39,804
What is this?

693
01:39:40,641 --> 01:39:42,302
This one is...

694
01:39:53,354 --> 01:39:54,878
This one is me.

695
01:39:55,789 --> 01:39:57,313
And this is me.

696
01:39:57,624 --> 01:39:58,989
Who?

697
01:40:02,429 --> 01:40:04,329
Both... me...

698
01:40:05,799 --> 01:40:09,235
Both of them are me.

699
01:40:15,676 --> 01:40:17,906
Let me, let me.

700
01:40:27,421 --> 01:40:30,754
I'll do it, I'll do it.

701
01:40:31,725 --> 01:40:36,856
<i>May the supreme jewel Bodhicitta</i>

702
01:40:37,264 --> 01:40:41,462
<i>not arisen, arise and grow;</i>

703
01:40:41,802 --> 01:40:45,636
<i>That arisen not diminish...</i>

704
01:40:45,806 --> 01:40:48,036
<i>- But increase more and more.
- But increase more and more.</i>

705
01:40:48,208 --> 01:40:49,766
<i>Increase, increase...</i>
