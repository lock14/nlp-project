1
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:32,280
Oh, my God. Stuart.

2
00:01:32,357 --> 00:01:35,485
- What is it?
- Tom's grades finally posted.

3
00:01:36,962 --> 00:01:40,398
- Look.

4
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:43,401
- Not one "A. "
- No.

5
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:45,437
- Or a " B."
- Mm-mmm.

6
00:01:45,504 --> 00:01:48,371
- Not even in Health.

7
00:01:49,908 --> 00:01:52,502
- What the--
- That was just a "D".

8
00:01:52,578 --> 00:01:54,705
- How are these changing?

9
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:02,485
One word, and you're dead.

10
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,089
Are you crazy?
If Dad catches you, he's gonna kill you.

11
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,095
Dad's not gonna catch me.

12
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:13,495
Mwah! I don't get it.
What do you see in that guy?

13
00:02:13,565 --> 00:02:15,658
Bye, babe!

14
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:18,669
You mean, other than the fact
that he's good-looking, sweet...

15
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:23,265
sensitive, romantic, funny
and ridiculously athletic?

16
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:28,279
- Dad's coming, and he's mad.
- At who?

17
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:30,577
- Tom.
- Tom!

18
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,584
What? If you're smart enough
to hack into the school Web site...

19
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:39,590
then you are smart enough to pass math.

20
00:02:39,658 --> 00:02:43,651
Do you think Bethany got accepted to Michigan
by screwing around all the time?

21
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:47,187
Of course not.
She got in 'cause she's perfect.

22
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:51,066
No. Your sister worked her tail off,
and that's exactly what I expect from you.

23
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:53,127
Yeah. You're right, Dad.

24
00:02:53,205 --> 00:02:55,173
I-I-I don't deserve a family vacation.

25
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,231
I should stay home tomorrow, learn my lesson.

26
00:02:57,309 --> 00:03:00,210
Oh, no, no. I am not taking that bait, kiddo.

27
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:04,215
This isn't you. The bad attitude, the grades.
What is going on?

28
00:03:04,283 --> 00:03:06,808
Nothing.

29
00:03:06,885 --> 00:03:10,616
I blame all this
for coming between this right here.

30
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:13,715
Some good old-fashioned no-tech--

31
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,259
- Uh--

32
00:03:15,327 --> 00:03:18,421
family togetherness is exactly what we need.

33
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:22,360
So get some sleep.
We're hitting the road at sunup.

34
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:24,698
Oh, and you guys too.

35
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:48,257
Hannah. Please, next time,
you ride the hump, okay?

36
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:51,194
I barf in the middle. Remember?

37
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:12,611
And that's the farm report.
In other news, it looks like...

38
00:04:12,684 --> 00:04:15,346
there will be more than just fireworks
in the sky tonight...

39
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,856
as an unexpected meteor shower adds a little
excitement to our area this holiday weekend.

40
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:22,826
- Very exciting. We're in for a little bit of a show.
- That'll be beautiful, guys.

41
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:26,523
Better wear hats tonight.
We don't want our heads catching on fire.

42
00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:34,606
- Wow.

43
00:04:34,673 --> 00:04:36,732
- Hey.
- Your boy toy is a complete idiot.

44
00:04:36,808 --> 00:04:39,003
Ricky is not a boy toy.

45
00:04:39,077 --> 00:04:41,204
- We're in a mature, loving relationship.

46
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,545
Why don't we talk in a few years
when you have a clue what dating's all about?

47
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:49,076
Like Ricky has a clue? One more word
about Ricky, and I swear to God I'll kill you.

48
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:52,590
Okay. That is enough.
Knock it off, you guys.

49
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:54,649
We're almost there.

50
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:15,377
And there's the pool. See ya!

51
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:18,814
We beat Uncle Nate! Oh, yeah! Ha-ha!

52
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:22,580
- Ah.
- I got it, Tom. Don't worry.

53
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:25,088
- Nice, huh?
- Great, yes. I'll grab that.

54
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:29,355
I hope there was a discount for booking us
into the most boring spot in the whole country.

55
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:32,625
We're only a stone's throw away from
at least a half dozen top-notch fishing lakes.

56
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:36,464
Are we near a time machine so we can go back
5 years to when I thought fishing was cool?

57
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:40,801
Hey, I bought us all new Sidestab reels.
Anti-Reverse technology.

58
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:43,768
Lame.

59
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:56,787
So lame.

60
00:06:31,723 --> 00:06:33,714
- Nice landing, Nate.

61
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:35,783
Told you I could fishtail this thing.

62
00:06:35,861 --> 00:06:38,523
Nice try, Nate, but you just missed my kids.

63
00:06:38,597 --> 00:06:41,760
But he did almost give
your mother a heart attack.

64
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,858
- Again.
- Nana!

65
00:06:43,935 --> 00:06:45,869
- Hi, Mom.
- Oh, hi, darling.

66
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:48,929
- Nana!
- Yes, sweetheart!

67
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:50,941
Ooh!

68
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:52,977
- I got you a little treat.
- You did?

69
00:06:53,044 --> 00:06:55,877
Yes, I did. Here we go.

70
00:06:55,947 --> 00:06:57,881
- Thank you.

71
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:01,214
- Oh, it's so good to see you. I missed you.
- Hey. We're here.

72
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:06,355
Well, one of the Pearson brothers
came to party.

73
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:10,054
- Are those even legal here?
- No.

74
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:12,824
Here! Come on, Stu! Let's get him!

75
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:15,833
- Nate, stop it! I'll tell Mom.
- Tickle him! Tickle your uncle!

76
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:18,893
- Spin him faster, Nate!
- Get his shirt off!

77
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:23,805
Aw, Stuey's crying for Mommy!

78
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:30,674
Twins, in here.

79
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:33,013
- Hey, guys.
- Put my bags on the bed.

80
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:35,143
Sir, yes, sir.

81
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,519
- Trying to be a wise guy?
- No. No. Definitely not. Don't provoke him.

82
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,854
Good. Now, get these out of here.

83
00:07:40,926 --> 00:07:44,384
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.
Why do you get the best room? I was here first.

84
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:46,988
- I'm here now.
- I'm older.

85
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:49,829
And I'm bigger.

86
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:52,836
Did you... grow since Christmas?

87
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:56,601
2 inches, cuz. I can tag a stop sign
without even having to jump.

88
00:07:56,675 --> 00:07:59,872
How's Mathletes?

89
00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:02,436
I don't do Mathletes anymore.

90
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:05,677
- You tired of getting beat up?
- Tom!

91
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,777
Get down here and help us unload! Now!

92
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:11,846
Close my door on the way out.

93
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,435
- Surprise, surprise, princess.
- Ricky, what are you doing here?

94
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,479
Oh, I'm just stopping by for the afternoon...

95
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:36,343
or maybe the night.

96
00:08:44,656 --> 00:08:47,090
- What's that?
- What's what?

97
00:08:47,158 --> 00:08:50,286
- Ricky!
- Hey! Mmm!

98
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:52,592
- Whoa. Watch out for the car.
- I can't believe you're here.

99
00:08:52,664 --> 00:08:54,655
Well, you're my girl friend now...

100
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:57,133
so there's nothing I wouldn't do for you.

101
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:59,466
- Now, give papa some sugar.

102
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:02,268
Bethany. Please don't give papa sugar.

103
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:06,469
Mr. and Mrs. P!

104
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:09,343
- Ricky, wow!
- Hey, Ricky! What a surprise.

105
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:12,008
- I got you a little housewarming gift.
- Oh, that is so sweet.

106
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,018
- Isn't he sweet?
- Yes. They're beautiful.

107
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:17,281
Those are gorgeous. Yeah.
Very patriotic too, huh?

108
00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:19,323
Let's stick the flags in some water,
see if they grow.

109
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:21,951
We can do that.
Do you want anything to eat or drink?

110
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:25,929
Oh, that is so sweet of you.
I really wish I could.

111
00:09:25,997 --> 00:09:27,589
But my parents have
a lake house in Oaks town...

112
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,863
and I gotta get back before dark
in case my car breaks down again.

113
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:34,770
- Uh-oh. Car trouble. Hmm.
- Dad, why don't you take a look at it for Ricky?

114
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,672
Yeah, I don't mind getting my hands dirty.

115
00:09:37,742 --> 00:09:40,040
- Try it again, Ricky.

116
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:42,341
It's gotta be something obvious, Dad.

117
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:45,713
I got to be honest with you.
Automechanics isn't really my thing.

118
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:48,981
Now, if this were a spreadsheet or a ledger,
I would be all over it, but--

119
00:09:49,054 --> 00:09:51,352
- I'll tell you what, Ricky. Stay here tonight...

120
00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:54,017
and then we'll take your car
to the shop in the morning.

121
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:56,560
Mr. P, that's really considerate of you.

122
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:58,323
- Well--
- Really? He can stay the night?

123
00:09:58,396 --> 00:10:00,887
- Yeah, in the den, on the couch.
- Of course.

124
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:03,161
- No fooling around.
- Dad.

125
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:05,828
What a gas pipe.

126
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:08,372
I know. Why can't they see that?

127
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,533
Well, dude, parents are wired differently.

128
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:14,477
Their brains are old, mushy,
fried from bad '80s music.

129
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:16,537
That's why it's up to you, Thomas.

130
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:19,311
You gotta defend your family honor,
like a man.

131
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:24,181
I call it the Punisher.

132
00:10:24,255 --> 00:10:26,951
- Your dad bought you this?
- Perks of divorce.

133
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:29,858
Never underestimate the power
of a grown man's guilt.

134
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:33,329
If we even mention Mom,
Nate drives us straight to the mall.

135
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:37,729
She's all yours.
Don't be a wuss all your life.

136
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:40,100
Uh-- I don't know, man.

137
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:45,332
Take a look at that guy.

138
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,744
- Do you really want Ricky as your brother-in-law?

139
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:54,682
Heck, no.

140
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:57,745
Then let's go prune the family tree.

141
00:10:59,224 --> 00:11:01,454
I had so much fun last night, Ricky.

142
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:07,123
Oh, yeah? Well, you know,
that's just the beginning.

143
00:11:07,198 --> 00:11:11,362
Man, the sun off the water and...
this lightweight cotton...

144
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:16,100
is... so... constricting.

145
00:11:16,174 --> 00:11:18,438
I hate cotton.

146
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,105
Mind helping me with the lotion, babe?

147
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:30,612
I'm thinking shooting my sister's boyfriend
isn't the best idea.

148
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:34,147
This isn't about ideas. This is about action.

149
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:36,159
Don't think. Do.

150
00:11:36,227 --> 00:11:39,492
I can't believe I'm even listening to you.
You're dressed like a shrub.

151
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:43,459
- Just a little on my chest.
- Target is on the move.

152
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:47,096
- Take him out before he reaches 2nd base.
- Nah. I don't think that--

153
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:57,113
- Why did you do that?
- Shut up. You'll compromise our position.

154
00:11:59,818 --> 00:12:02,252
Oh, my God. She saw us.
What do we do? What do we do?

155
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,256
Camo mode. Hunker down and blend.

156
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,018
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- You shot my boyfriend.

157
00:12:12,097 --> 00:12:14,861
"Sorry" doesn't even touch that.
When, Tom?

158
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:17,629
When are you gonna grow up
and stop being a total embarrassment?

159
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:21,635
And that's why we use camo.

160
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:23,765
Shut up, Jake.

161
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,769
- Ooh!
- Are you gonna be okay?

162
00:12:27,846 --> 00:12:29,939
I don't know what you were thinking.
I really don't.

163
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:32,005
- Yeah, I'm gonna be all right.
- A paintball gun.

164
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,278
- This was a good idea though, Miss Smarty-Pants.
- That's a gateway gun.

165
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:36,684
How about what's next?
B.B.? Pellet?

166
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:40,885
Stun? What am I gonna do? What do you
think I should do? I don't know what to do.

167
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,359
Can't you keep him in his room
for the rest of the week?

168
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:47,057
- But it wasn't even me. Okay, you boys
are just lucky that Ricky wasn't badly hurt.

169
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:49,999
It's okay, Mr. P.
I was a little kid once too.

170
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:53,037
Oh, that's nice, Ricky.
Thank you. He's a good guy.

171
00:12:53,104 --> 00:12:56,096
He's a good guy.
But, no, I'm not okay with this.

172
00:12:56,174 --> 00:12:59,109
Look, we're up here to fish,
not to hunt your sister's boyfriend, all right?

173
00:12:59,177 --> 00:13:03,739
You could have put his eye out.
Would that have been funny? I don't think so.

174
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,584
All right, let's start over with a clean slate.

175
00:13:07,652 --> 00:13:09,882
Tomorrow, we fish.

176
00:13:09,954 --> 00:13:11,649
- 7:00 a.m. sharp.
- 7:00?

177
00:13:11,723 --> 00:13:14,317
- You're kidding.
- Pass. Nate?

178
00:13:14,392 --> 00:13:17,759
Yeah, Stu. Don't you think that's a little early?
How about this?

179
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:20,889
10:00 a.m., on the boat, no questions asked.

180
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:23,991
Way to crack the whip, Nate.
Way to crack the whip.

181
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:34,533
Oh, Stu. Stu.

182
00:13:34,612 --> 00:13:37,479
Natey, the TV's gone haywire.

183
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:39,540
Stu, TV's gone haywire!

184
00:13:39,617 --> 00:13:43,451
- Mom. Mom, stop it. It's probably the dish.

185
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:45,512
After the storm,
I'll climb up on the roof and fix it.

186
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:48,457
Hey, wait a second, Mr. P.
Let me fix the dish, man.

187
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:50,517
That's the least I can do for your hospitality.

188
00:13:50,595 --> 00:13:53,223
- No, Ricky. You're hurt.
- Oh, no. It was just a graze.

189
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:55,391
Oh, no, honey. He's fine.

190
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:57,957
Go ahead, Richard. Show some hustle.

191
00:13:58,036 --> 00:14:02,405
Yes, indeedy.
But I will be needing a helping hand.

192
00:14:02,473 --> 00:14:06,910
So what do you say, brother?
Give us a chance to bury the old hatchet.

193
00:14:09,714 --> 00:14:13,343
Make things right with Ricky,
or don't come off that roof.

194
00:14:23,194 --> 00:14:25,526
Uh, ladies first.

195
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:32,402
Whoa.

196
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,667
Whoa. Total creep show.

197
00:14:38,676 --> 00:14:40,837
All right. Here we go.

198
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:43,472
Listen, about that paintball thing--

199
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:46,949
Oh, hey. Don't even worry about it.

200
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:50,449
Firecracker! Too slow.

201
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:54,389
You know what? Thanks to your little,
uh, sharp shooting stunt...

202
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:56,120
I racked up pity points with your parents...

203
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:58,560
and big sis is just itching
to be my private nurse.

204
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:03,158
So thanks a ton, ace.
That was a textbook wingman move.

205
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:05,168
Come on. Quit stalling.

206
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:07,932
Get your butt up there
and make me Nana's hero.

207
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:10,600
But you told my dad you'd fix it.

208
00:15:10,675 --> 00:15:12,700
Aw, well, I told your dad a lot of things.

209
00:15:12,777 --> 00:15:16,440
Like my car broke down,
my parents own a lake house...

210
00:15:16,514 --> 00:15:18,641
I'm 18.

211
00:15:20,184 --> 00:15:22,675
You-You're not a senior?

212
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:24,722
Not in high school.

213
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:28,154
- Now go.

214
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:32,520
Go.

215
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:35,691
There you go.

216
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:21,836
Hello?

217
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,124
Hello?

218
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:43,430
- Dude, you make it too easy.
- It's not funny.

219
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:45,969
What the heck happened to the dish?

220
00:16:46,037 --> 00:16:48,062
I can't do a week here without TV.

221
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:50,073
I can't do a week here, period.

222
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:03,219
- Whoa.

223
00:17:03,287 --> 00:17:07,246
- Hello, hu-mans.

224
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:10,886
- Please tell me you see that too.
- Not sure I want to.

225
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:13,294
- But, yeah.
- We come from upstairs!

226
00:17:13,364 --> 00:17:16,663
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa.
I handle human contact.

227
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:19,828
- Yes, sir. Noted. It's understood.
- Hello, humans.

228
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:23,772
No need to notification army.

229
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:25,809
- We come in pieces.
- In peace.

230
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:27,310
- What?
- Say it with me. "Peace. "

231
00:17:27,378 --> 00:17:29,573
- What are you talking about?
- Read the book. Peace.

232
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:32,275
Forget the book!
Attack the humans! Attack!

233
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:36,081
- With pleasure.
- Humans, submit.

234
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:40,488
- Hey, what is taking you girls so long?
- No, don't. No. No.

235
00:17:42,827 --> 00:17:45,625
- Ricky!

236
00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:49,097
- What's happening to him?
- Now the fun begins.

237
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:53,399
- Testing. Testing. Testing.
- Testing. Testing. Testing.

238
00:17:53,471 --> 00:17:55,996
- Testing.

239
00:17:58,443 --> 00:18:02,470
Humanoid subjects,
we are the Zirkonian species.

240
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:06,506
And we hereby claim your
luscious planet as our own.

241
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:11,988
Wha- Wha...  You have
the choice of eternal enslavement or...

242
00:18:13,124 --> 00:18:15,024
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

243
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:17,061
instantaneous death.

244
00:18:17,128 --> 00:18:19,187
- Run?
- I'm good with run.

245
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:23,529
- You have chosen instantaneous death.

246
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:25,535
The human grubs are escaping.

247
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:28,037
- It's locked.
- Not from me.

248
00:18:31,943 --> 00:18:34,207
- We're trapped.
- Duck!

249
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:43,251
- Unbelievable.

250
00:18:46,124 --> 00:18:48,524
- Razor, go!
- Yes, sir.

251
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:56,324
- Hey, can I play too?
- Oh, Hannah, thank God. Open. Hurry.

252
00:18:58,069 --> 00:18:59,730
Hurry.

253
00:19:00,938 --> 00:19:02,997
Creepy-crawly!

254
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:05,838
No, no, no, no. Come back. Come back!

255
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,878
- Take them down!
- Look out!

256
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:10,209
Hey, frog-face!

257
00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:15,248
What's with all the noise?

258
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,254
- Open the window!
- Open it.

259
00:19:18,322 --> 00:19:20,256
- You open it.
- No, you open it.

260
00:19:20,324 --> 00:19:22,292
- Hurry! Get them!
- Help!

261
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,590
Someone, open it!

262
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:26,789
Come on. Right there.

263
00:19:26,864 --> 00:19:29,025
- Charge!
- Hurry up!

264
00:19:30,101 --> 00:19:32,126
Move, twin!

265
00:19:34,705 --> 00:19:37,139
Everybody, downstairs now!

266
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,698
- Why?
-Just move!

267
00:19:43,447 --> 00:19:48,111
- Creepy-crawlies.

268
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:50,552
- Creepy.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

269
00:19:50,621 --> 00:19:52,589
Get down! Down!

270
00:19:56,994 --> 00:20:00,987
- Pull! Pull! Pull!
- I am! Hurry!

271
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:07,602
- Stupid remote control.
- Glorious commander, be careful.

272
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:09,936
- What's wrong with it? Fix it.
- Be careful!

273
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:13,272
- You a zombie?

274
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:16,973
- No. You?
- No.

275
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:18,675
Prove it.

276
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:21,309
- What do you mean?
- I mean prove it!

277
00:20:21,385 --> 00:20:24,411
You-You wet the bed until you were 10.
A zombie wouldn't know that.

278
00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:26,615
- Here they come! Look out!
- Ugly humans, submit.

279
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:30,491
Get the rope.

280
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:33,189
- Tie it off!
- I'm trying. Push harder.

281
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:35,323
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

282
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:38,129
She scratched me with her claws!

283
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:39,794
Sorry, sucker.

284
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,339
Whoa. He cut off her nails.

285
00:20:42,406 --> 00:20:44,340
We gotta call 911.

286
00:20:52,116 --> 00:20:54,107
- I can't get a signal.
- Neither can I.

287
00:20:54,185 --> 00:20:57,882
Mine's dead too.

288
00:20:57,955 --> 00:21:00,480
- Those midget Martians must be jamming us.
- Never a good sign.

289
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:03,459
- It's working!

290
00:21:05,062 --> 00:21:07,724
There's no buttons. What is this thing?

291
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:11,461
It's a rotary phone. You spin it.

292
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:21,869
What happened up there?
Was "get them" not clear enough?

293
00:21:21,946 --> 00:21:24,744
Someone was obviously distracted.

294
00:21:24,815 --> 00:21:27,079
I was following the plan.

295
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:29,142
You were playing with your little toy.

296
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,519
- This is a deadly weapon! It is.
- No. These are deadly weapons.

297
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:36,822
Listen on yourselves. This is why
we lost success on our mission previous.

298
00:21:36,894 --> 00:21:39,692
Not looking to blame throw,
but that one was Razor's fault.

299
00:21:39,764 --> 00:21:44,360
What? You were the one... If we lose
success this time, I lose my command.

300
00:21:44,435 --> 00:21:46,426
Now, you're going to learn to work together...

301
00:21:46,504 --> 00:21:49,735
or we will together end up shoveling manure
back in Sector 7.

302
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:51,798
We won't let you down, sir.

303
00:21:51,876 --> 00:21:54,310
Let's go enslave some humans!

304
00:21:54,378 --> 00:21:58,747
Actually, uh, about that,
I'm sure enslaving is plenty of fun.

305
00:21:58,816 --> 00:22:00,807
- But why the hu-mans?
- What?

306
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:03,012
- They don't seem that bad.
- Aw. Rookie.

307
00:22:03,087 --> 00:22:05,317
Oh, "they don't seem that bad."

308
00:22:05,389 --> 00:22:08,916
- Funny. That's what our engineer previous said.
- Engineer previous?

309
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:12,588
Right before the creature
that was "not that bad" ate him!

310
00:22:12,663 --> 00:22:15,131
- The humans are vicious.

311
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:18,760
Peace is not an option.

312
00:22:22,206 --> 00:22:24,970
- Sheriff here.

313
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:27,442
Uh, th-there's an alien invasion
at our rental house.

314
00:22:27,511 --> 00:22:31,072
- Knee-high beings. Very violent.
- Knee-high. Like a hobbit?

315
00:22:31,148 --> 00:22:33,241
No. Real. Look, I know this sounds crazy...

316
00:22:33,317 --> 00:22:36,252
- but you gotta understand--
- Okay, yeah, listen, son.

317
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,381
You do know making a fraudulent complaint
is a federal offense. It's punishable--

318
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,392
- Hello?

319
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,587
- Hmm.

320
00:22:44,662 --> 00:22:47,756
Decent technique... for a female.

321
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:50,461
- How's that technique?

322
00:22:50,534 --> 00:22:52,900
- Hello?

323
00:22:53,037 --> 00:22:55,471
- We gotta tell our parents.

324
00:23:20,598 --> 00:23:23,089
Think he's still an alien zombie?

325
00:23:28,172 --> 00:23:31,005
- You are useless.

326
00:23:31,075 --> 00:23:34,442
Why aren't the mind-control plugs working?
You're the engineer.

327
00:23:34,512 --> 00:23:36,707
Figure it out. Hurry up. Hurry up.

328
00:23:36,781 --> 00:23:38,772
- Hurry up. Hurry up. Fix it!

329
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:41,317
- Fix it. Fix it now, you idiot.
- He's not talking to us, right?

330
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:45,549
I think he's picking up their conversation.
They had, like, a Bluetooth.

331
00:23:45,623 --> 00:23:47,750
What do you mean their hormone levels
are too unstable?

332
00:23:47,825 --> 00:23:49,816
Are you telling me the plugs only work
on mature subjects?

333
00:23:49,894 --> 00:23:52,192
Why did we not plan for this?

334
00:23:52,263 --> 00:23:54,356
You have failed me, you incompetent piece of--

335
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:56,992
- Deck.
- Translation not available.

336
00:23:57,067 --> 00:24:01,026
These humans will pay!

337
00:24:03,707 --> 00:24:05,971
- Did you hear that?

338
00:24:06,043 --> 00:24:08,068
Yeah. Sounds like Ricky landed on his face.

339
00:24:08,145 --> 00:24:11,876
No. Those things they shot at us,
they-re-they're mind-control plugs.

340
00:24:11,949 --> 00:24:15,578
They won't work on kids.
It's like you said. We're wired differently.

341
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:18,087
Wha-What about Ricky?
It tagged him and he's Bethany's age.

342
00:24:18,155 --> 00:24:20,521
No. He lied. The tool's in college.

343
00:24:20,591 --> 00:24:22,525
So if their plugs don't work on kids--

344
00:24:22,593 --> 00:24:24,527
- That means we're safe.
- It means we can fight 'em.

345
00:24:24,595 --> 00:24:27,996
It means they'll go after our parents.
They're walking targets.

346
00:24:28,065 --> 00:24:30,090
We got to tell 'em. Now.

347
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:32,533
Whoa, whoa. Wait. Think.

348
00:24:32,603 --> 00:24:36,164
If our parents even go near those things,
they'll get zapped and end up zombies.

349
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,504
Our own parents will attack us.

350
00:24:38,576 --> 00:24:42,342
- We need the police and their hard-core firepower.
- Oh, armed zombies. Even better.

351
00:24:42,413 --> 00:24:47,180
We're done. Game over. Game over for the grown-ups.
But we can still fight back.

352
00:24:47,251 --> 00:24:50,015
So you expect us to stop
an alien invasion on our own?

353
00:24:50,087 --> 00:24:53,079
He's right. We're the only option.

354
00:24:53,157 --> 00:24:55,182
But we can't tell anyone.

355
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:57,955
No police, no parents, no exceptions.

356
00:24:58,028 --> 00:25:00,223
- Got it?
- Hannah?

357
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:04,968
They're up in the attic right now, little aliens.

358
00:25:05,035 --> 00:25:10,234
They're loud and scary and really mean.

359
00:25:10,307 --> 00:25:14,607
- Han, there's no such things as aliens.
- Yes, there is. I saw them.

360
00:25:14,678 --> 00:25:18,205
They smashed the skylight
and tried to break the attic stairs.

361
00:25:18,282 --> 00:25:22,150
Well, let's hope not for your sake.
We put a huge deposit on this place.

362
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:24,483
So you boys better keep it in one piece.

363
00:25:24,555 --> 00:25:26,887
- You heard her, Tom. No more trouble.
- It was just a video game.

364
00:25:26,957 --> 00:25:30,552
- We shouldn't have let her watch. It's rated "T" for "Teen".  
- It's teen violence.

365
00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:34,462
Tommy, I'm scared.
I don't like the mean aliens.

366
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:39,560
Don't worry, Han. Just pretend it's a big game,
a game that we're gonna win.

367
00:25:39,637 --> 00:25:43,232
-Just think about how little they are.
- Little and deadly.

368
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:46,140
- What do we do now?
- We figure out their weakness.

369
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:49,338
They flew here from another galaxy.
You really think they have a weakness?

370
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:52,541
First rule of the warrior code--

371
00:25:52,616 --> 00:25:54,607
All enemies have a weakness.

372
00:25:54,685 --> 00:25:58,348
Sparks, why isn't my locator map
up and running?

373
00:25:58,422 --> 00:26:01,414
I told you. I need parts to repair it.
You're not helping--

374
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:10,261
- Aha! Even on Earth, the male is dominant.
- Ah.

375
00:26:10,334 --> 00:26:12,768
Aha. Oh.

376
00:26:12,836 --> 00:26:15,828
- Wait.
- Ah. But the female always wins.

377
00:26:15,906 --> 00:26:18,033
What the--

378
00:26:18,108 --> 00:26:21,475
By the rings of Zirkon.

379
00:26:21,545 --> 00:26:23,775
Huh? That makes no sense.

380
00:26:23,847 --> 00:26:27,305
They were fighting.
Now their lips are hugging?

381
00:26:27,384 --> 00:26:29,318
- I would never.
- Never.

382
00:26:29,386 --> 00:26:31,684
- Ne-ver.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

383
00:26:31,755 --> 00:26:34,588
Can I get you anything?
A cold drink? Some snacks? Hmm?

384
00:26:34,658 --> 00:26:38,219
- Or would you rather help me invade a planet?

385
00:26:40,297 --> 00:26:43,858
All right, recon's my specialty.
I'm going up.

386
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:54,900
- I'm coming with you.
- Tom, be careful.

387
00:26:58,682 --> 00:27:01,708
- Enemy... apprehended.

388
00:27:01,785 --> 00:27:05,812
- I'll interrogate.
- Ah!

389
00:27:11,662 --> 00:27:14,825
- Ah. Disgusting.
- What? Seriously, what?

390
00:27:14,898 --> 00:27:16,832
Locator activated, sir.

391
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,300
Excellent. Target the objective.

392
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:22,168
Zoom in. Zoom.

393
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:26,266
Zoom. Zoom, zoom, zoom.

394
00:27:26,343 --> 00:27:31,440
- You don't have to keep saying "zoom. "
- Zoom. Zoom.

395
00:27:31,515 --> 00:27:33,449
And... rotate.

396
00:27:33,517 --> 00:27:36,008
I think they're after
something in the house.

397
00:27:36,086 --> 00:27:38,281
- Let me get a better look.
- Stop.

398
00:27:38,355 --> 00:27:43,190
- Rotate. Ah. The basement.

399
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,024
- Tom, help me!
- Ah.

400
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,997
- That must have hurt.

401
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,732
Basement. We gotta get to the basement.

402
00:27:55,806 --> 00:27:57,706
Ricky?

403
00:27:57,775 --> 00:27:59,709
Ricky!

404
00:27:59,777 --> 00:28:03,269
Oh. Hey, guys, wait.
Have you guys seen Ricky?

405
00:28:03,347 --> 00:28:06,612
Uh, pretty sure he's still
hanging around here somewhere.

406
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:09,118
- Actually, Beth, uh--
- He didn't leave, did he?

407
00:28:09,186 --> 00:28:12,314
No, no. He, um--
He told us he was heading back to the lake...

408
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:15,290
uh, to, bronze up his rock-hard abs.

409
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:17,554
- Yeah, he wants you to meet him there.
- Wait.

410
00:28:17,628 --> 00:28:20,256
What did you guys talk about on the roof?

411
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,264
Did he say anything about me?

412
00:28:22,332 --> 00:28:25,324
No. No, no. He-- He talked about his car.

413
00:28:25,402 --> 00:28:29,236
And, um--
But pre-pretty much just his car.

414
00:28:29,306 --> 00:28:31,604
Um, but you should hit the lake so
he doesn't think you're blowing him off.

415
00:28:31,675 --> 00:28:34,667
- Yeah, the lake.
- Over there. It's probably good there.

416
00:28:38,782 --> 00:28:42,343
- I'm telling you, their map led down here.
- You positive?

417
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:45,946
Shh. You hear that? Rice Krispies.

418
00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:01,933
- What is that?

419
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:08,102
It's them.

420
00:29:10,948 --> 00:29:12,939
Something down here's setting it off.

421
00:29:24,294 --> 00:29:27,786
Well, whatever it is,
we can't let 'em get to it.

422
00:29:27,865 --> 00:29:30,356
Everyone, gear up. We move on my command.

423
00:29:30,434 --> 00:29:32,527
Now, just hold on.

424
00:29:32,603 --> 00:29:36,630
If we run up there with a bunch
of random junk, we're gonna get creamed.

425
00:29:36,707 --> 00:29:39,039
We can make something better.

426
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:41,304
We're in the middle of a battle,
and you wanna play science fair?

427
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:44,541
No way. We're going back in now...

428
00:29:44,615 --> 00:29:47,049
before our parents end up as alien zombies.

429
00:29:47,117 --> 00:29:49,483
You're not thinking. We need a plan.

430
00:29:49,553 --> 00:29:52,386
- I already have a great idea for a weapon.
- Really?

431
00:29:52,456 --> 00:29:54,822
Let's go.

432
00:29:54,892 --> 00:29:56,883
Now.

433
00:30:03,901 --> 00:30:05,562
Hannah, hand me that tape.

434
00:30:06,637 --> 00:30:08,571
- What's up, Nate?
- Hey, guys!

435
00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:10,573
- Hey, Nana!
- Who wants a treat?

436
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:15,544
Whoo.
That's a lot of tools to try to fix the TV.

437
00:30:28,692 --> 00:30:31,525
They're busting through.
The warrior code says strike first.

438
00:30:31,595 --> 00:30:34,860
- Art, cover me.
- With the rake?

439
00:30:44,374 --> 00:30:47,969
How do you feel now? Suckers!

440
00:30:48,979 --> 00:30:51,072
Mission accomplished.

441
00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:58,715
Oh, God.

442
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:00,051
- Oh--
- Crud.

443
00:31:02,326 --> 00:31:05,318
It's a dud.

444
00:31:07,364 --> 00:31:10,162
What the-- Whoa!

445
00:31:10,234 --> 00:31:12,395
- Whoa! What's happening?
- Why are we floating?

446
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:15,597
They turned off the gravity,
like in Halo.

447
00:31:15,672 --> 00:31:19,768
This isn't Xbox, Lee.
It's real. Like Wii.

448
00:31:19,843 --> 00:31:23,745
- Now what are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

449
00:31:23,814 --> 00:31:26,840
Stay behind me.

450
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:30,318
- No! Don't! Don't!
- [Lee] There's no gravity.

451
00:31:34,691 --> 00:31:37,353
Hello, hu-mans.

452
00:31:37,427 --> 00:31:40,123
Enjoying the ride?

453
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,134
They have gravity boots.

454
00:31:45,202 --> 00:31:47,830
- Why don't we have gravity boots?
- "They have gravity boots."

455
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:51,204
The door! Stop 'em! Use your weapon, Tom!

456
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:53,470
- Bring it, meat sack.
- Today!

457
00:31:55,545 --> 00:31:59,208
A potato gun? That's your big idea?

458
00:31:59,283 --> 00:32:03,117
- My plan is working.
- My plan. You mean my plan.

459
00:32:05,122 --> 00:32:07,056
Hurry, Tommy!

460
00:32:12,496 --> 00:32:14,555
Oh!

461
00:32:24,741 --> 00:32:26,072
- Ooh.

462
00:32:26,143 --> 00:32:29,635
- You okay?
- I'm fine. The door.

463
00:32:29,713 --> 00:32:31,647
On it.

464
00:32:31,715 --> 00:32:33,842
Jake, get the grenade!

465
00:32:36,553 --> 00:32:38,987
- Ah.
- Hurry!

466
00:32:42,726 --> 00:32:45,217
Quick! Toss it here!

467
00:32:48,465 --> 00:32:50,990
- What?
- Oh!

468
00:32:52,135 --> 00:32:55,764
Sock Monkey.

469
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:58,330
Oh! Ha!

470
00:32:58,408 --> 00:33:00,433
You little--

471
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,171
Quick! Get 'em!

472
00:33:02,245 --> 00:33:03,769
- Go!

473
00:33:03,847 --> 00:33:06,680
- Shoot him! Shoot him!
- Go, go, go!

474
00:33:06,817 --> 00:33:10,048
- Shoot him!
- Ouch! Ow! Ouch again!

475
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,611
- Buttocks on fire!

476
00:33:14,124 --> 00:33:17,116
Whoa.
That's the thing they used to control Ricky.

477
00:33:17,194 --> 00:33:20,186
- Whoa!

478
00:33:20,263 --> 00:33:23,630
Oh, cool. Let me see it.
Oh, nice action on the toggles.

479
00:33:25,535 --> 00:33:28,629
Wait. What are these?
Give it back. Let me see.

480
00:33:28,705 --> 00:33:31,936
- I picked it up first.
- Give it back.

481
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:34,409
- It's mine.
- Hey, hey, hey, guys. This is not a toy. It's real.

482
00:33:41,451 --> 00:33:43,612
- Ricky?
- Yep.

483
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:45,780
Get him before somebody finds him.
I'll stand alien watch.

484
00:33:57,267 --> 00:33:59,895
- I'm sure that'll buff right out.

485
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,268
Wonder where he went.

486
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:05,172
- Oh, I'll find him.

487
00:34:07,844 --> 00:34:09,505
Whoa.

488
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:21,180
Cool. So these move him.
And these... operate the arms.

489
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:29,829
- Talk about the ultimate Game Boy.

490
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:35,330
- What does that big button do?

491
00:34:40,444 --> 00:34:43,880
Whoa! What the--

492
00:34:43,947 --> 00:34:46,848
- My car!

493
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:50,284
That would be the on-and-off button.

494
00:34:50,353 --> 00:34:52,821
- Press it again.

495
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:54,720
Car!

496
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:59,387
- Who did this to my car?
- You did, you giant idiot.

497
00:34:59,463 --> 00:35:01,055
Ricky!

498
00:35:03,533 --> 00:35:05,296
- Where have you been?

499
00:35:05,368 --> 00:35:08,462
Oh, shut up, you little b-- Bethany.

500
00:35:08,538 --> 00:35:10,836
- What?
- Ah!

501
00:35:10,907 --> 00:35:14,172
- Why are you hitting me?
- Why are you being such a jerk?

502
00:35:14,244 --> 00:35:16,678
- Huh?
- Revenge is so sweet.

503
00:35:16,746 --> 00:35:19,476
I just spent the last hour
walking around the lake. Where were you?

504
00:35:19,549 --> 00:35:22,985
- Uh-- I--
- That's what I thought.

505
00:35:23,053 --> 00:35:25,453
- No. I-I don't know.

506
00:35:25,522 --> 00:35:27,513
- Want me to bring him back?
- Babe, please don't be mad at me.

507
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:30,059
- Did your brain fall out of your head?
- Let him suffer.

508
00:35:40,637 --> 00:35:44,038
Where's Ricky?
Taken prisoner by the aliens?

509
00:35:44,107 --> 00:35:47,543
No. Worse. My sister.

510
00:35:48,845 --> 00:35:51,075
Any action up here?

511
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:54,584
It's been quiet. Too quiet.

512
00:35:54,651 --> 00:35:58,519
No talking in here. Got it?

513
00:36:01,324 --> 00:36:03,519
What are they doing in the vents?

514
00:36:03,593 --> 00:36:07,586
- Their map. That's how they'll get to the basement.
- What do we do?

515
00:36:13,803 --> 00:36:15,794
I hope this works, Einstein.

516
00:36:15,872 --> 00:36:19,865
I didn't get to thank you
for pulling me to safety back there...

517
00:36:19,943 --> 00:36:21,911
because I didn't need you to.

518
00:36:21,978 --> 00:36:24,378
- Uh, that doesn't make sense.
- I don't like you.

519
00:36:24,447 --> 00:36:26,438
- Shh. Stop talking.
- Good to know. Okay.

520
00:36:29,553 --> 00:36:32,021
Hmm?

521
00:36:32,088 --> 00:36:34,318
Hmm. Sweating?

522
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:38,252
Hot! Ah!

523
00:36:38,328 --> 00:36:41,092
Hot! Hot! Hotter! Run!

524
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,167
Fall back! Fall back! Ouch! Ouch!

525
00:36:48,238 --> 00:36:50,297
- Sounds like they're mad.

526
00:36:50,373 --> 00:36:52,933
Nice job. I think it's working.

527
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:55,068
Kids, get down here right now!

528
00:36:58,148 --> 00:37:00,173
Who turned on the heat?

529
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,343
I did. Um, we need that on.

530
00:37:02,419 --> 00:37:04,319
Are you crazy? It's July.

531
00:37:04,387 --> 00:37:07,413
- Yeah, but it's-- it's freezing in here.
- Ooh, yeah. Ooh, Arctic.

532
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,822
Yeah. I think Hannah's
coming down with something.

533
00:37:12,229 --> 00:37:14,197
What's going on?

534
00:37:14,264 --> 00:37:18,030
We're fighting aliens.
I'm pretending it's pretend.

535
00:37:18,101 --> 00:37:20,433
I mean, it is pretend.

536
00:37:20,503 --> 00:37:24,701
Okay, but I'm not pretending,
so don't touch the thermostat.

537
00:37:24,774 --> 00:37:27,766
- Tom, I'm not playing around.
- Neither am I.

538
00:37:27,844 --> 00:37:30,972
Tom, I'm not kidding. You wanna spend
the rest of the week in your room?

539
00:37:31,047 --> 00:37:33,140
Why can't you at least trust
there's a reason I'm doing this?

540
00:37:33,216 --> 00:37:35,707
A reason why you're blasting the furnace
on summer vacation?

541
00:37:35,785 --> 00:37:37,616
Yes. A reason why you
shot your sister's boyfriend?

542
00:37:37,687 --> 00:37:40,520
Yes. A reason why you're
talking back, giving me attitude?

543
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:44,549
- Failing your classes?
- So that's what this is about?

544
00:37:46,229 --> 00:37:48,527
I failed them on purpose.

545
00:37:48,598 --> 00:37:50,623
Yeah, I tanked my grades, okay?

546
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,725
I'm tired of getting picked on
because I'm a brainiac.

547
00:37:52,802 --> 00:37:54,736
I was a brainiac. It worked for me.

548
00:37:54,804 --> 00:37:58,331
I don't wanna be like you. I wanna be cool.

549
00:38:03,813 --> 00:38:06,611
Don't touch the thermostat.

550
00:38:09,919 --> 00:38:13,719
Is that true?
You really fail on purpose?

551
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,350
Nobody likes a mathlete.

552
00:38:16,426 --> 00:38:18,894
Man, we can't fight these things
with our parents around.

553
00:38:18,962 --> 00:38:21,328
We can't just get rid of 'em.

554
00:38:21,398 --> 00:38:25,357
Maybe we can. Here's what I want you to do.

555
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:33,339
Send it.

556
00:38:34,878 --> 00:38:38,746
- I hate it when we fight.
- Aw, I can't fight someone as cute as you.

557
00:38:38,815 --> 00:38:40,715
Well, I'm glad we made up.

558
00:38:40,784 --> 00:38:43,617
Well, it's not an official make-up
without the make-up kiss.

559
00:38:43,687 --> 00:38:47,214
- Easy. My family's up there.
- And your family's crazy about me.

560
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:49,918
- What about you?
- Well, you know I like you.

561
00:38:49,993 --> 00:38:52,359
And we have the whole summer
ahead of us.

562
00:38:52,429 --> 00:38:55,057
Maybe we don't have to go so fast.

563
00:38:55,131 --> 00:38:57,258
What? What?

564
00:39:04,107 --> 00:39:06,041
Is that a "no"?

565
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:07,599
Ricky!

566
00:39:09,612 --> 00:39:11,842
Ricky!

567
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:16,210
- Careful. Don't break him.
- Ricky!

568
00:39:16,286 --> 00:39:18,811
- Better grab his shirt.
- Ricky!

569
00:39:21,391 --> 00:39:23,382
Still no sign of 'em.

570
00:39:26,963 --> 00:39:30,262
- Where are they?
- 2 options.

571
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:33,962
We're dealing with a retreat
or a surprise attack.

572
00:39:41,311 --> 00:39:43,939
- Surprise attack.

573
00:39:50,086 --> 00:39:53,021
Hey, where's Tom?
I thought he was gonna help you.

574
00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:55,819
- So did I.
- Bad news.

575
00:39:55,892 --> 00:39:58,190
The leasing office called.

576
00:39:58,261 --> 00:40:01,321
They need you to go back there
before they close for the holidays.

577
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:04,367
- Really?
- Problem with the contract.

578
00:40:04,434 --> 00:40:06,766
They insisted.

579
00:40:06,836 --> 00:40:09,100
Ricky, are you okay?

580
00:40:09,172 --> 00:40:11,766
Oh, um-- Um--

581
00:40:11,841 --> 00:40:14,435
-Just allergies, Mr. P.
-Just allergies, Mr. P.

582
00:40:14,511 --> 00:40:17,173
But they did say it's urgent.

583
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:20,683
- Urgent?
- Okay, I'll call and I'll sort this out.

584
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,548
That's so weird.

585
00:40:26,189 --> 00:40:30,455
Oh, this is weird, Stu.
I think the phone's dead.

586
00:40:33,096 --> 00:40:35,189
Did they just cut off our power?

587
00:40:35,265 --> 00:40:37,665
Oh, they are gonna hear about it from me.

588
00:40:37,734 --> 00:40:40,703
Let's go.
We are going down there right now.

589
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:43,238
Hey, guys, uh,
we can use some more beer, some chips.

590
00:40:43,306 --> 00:40:45,968
Why don't you run to the grocery store?
I'll fire up the grill.

591
00:40:46,042 --> 00:40:49,034
- And watch the kids?
- Okay, whatever.

592
00:40:49,112 --> 00:40:51,410
- No.
- No.

593
00:40:51,481 --> 00:40:54,746
I mean, you all have to go.

594
00:40:54,818 --> 00:40:58,015
- They said all your names are on the lease.

595
00:40:59,589 --> 00:41:01,887
- I'll look after the kids.
- I don't know if that's a good idea.

596
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:04,586
- No. That'd be--
- Well, I-- I guess I could drive.

597
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:06,686
Oh. Um-- Okay.

598
00:41:06,763 --> 00:41:09,391
- Okay.
- Oh, and, Mr. P...

599
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:12,435
while you're out,
can you get me some adult diapers?

600
00:41:12,502 --> 00:41:15,027
- Mine are almost full.
- Mine are almost full.

601
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,875
- That is a bad allergy.
- Oof.

602
00:41:19,943 --> 00:41:22,002
Super absorbent.

603
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:28,440
Look. Alien death mist. Don't breathe.

604
00:41:28,518 --> 00:41:31,248
- Put him on "pause."

605
00:41:35,225 --> 00:41:38,160
Happy 4th of July, space maggots.

606
00:41:38,228 --> 00:41:40,196
Jake, there's smoke in the vents.

607
00:41:40,263 --> 00:41:43,232
It's me. We have unfriendlies on the move.
I tracked them down and held 'em off.

608
00:41:43,299 --> 00:41:44,698
- Nice.
- Parents?

609
00:41:44,767 --> 00:41:46,860
- Gone.
- Nice.

610
00:41:46,936 --> 00:41:48,927
Now we can take it up a notch.

611
00:41:54,944 --> 00:41:57,879
This could get ugly. Hannah, go hide.

612
00:41:57,947 --> 00:42:01,644
- Yeah. Seek safety.
- Not you.

613
00:42:04,954 --> 00:42:06,888
Incoming! Duck!

614
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:10,926
Sayonara, suckers!

615
00:42:12,362 --> 00:42:14,455
- Oh--
- Crud.

616
00:42:18,434 --> 00:42:21,733
- My arm! My head!
- They got me!

617
00:42:21,871 --> 00:42:26,001
Go, go, go, go!

618
00:42:26,075 --> 00:42:30,444
I'm starting to see why the last engineer--

619
00:42:55,204 --> 00:42:57,695
I see you've booby-trapped your room.

620
00:42:57,774 --> 00:43:00,106
Got it. Got it. Ooh! Don't got it!

621
00:43:01,344 --> 00:43:05,041
Ingenious human snare.

622
00:43:09,919 --> 00:43:12,353
Ow.

623
00:43:15,959 --> 00:43:20,328
Oh, wow. I thought I was clumsy.

624
00:43:23,366 --> 00:43:26,062
- It's okay. Don't worry.
- I come in peace.

625
00:43:26,135 --> 00:43:28,933
It's okay. I'll help you.

626
00:43:31,874 --> 00:43:34,138
Don't worry. Trust me. It's okay.

627
00:43:36,546 --> 00:43:38,707
- Oh. Ow.
- Oh.

628
00:43:38,781 --> 00:43:40,908
You've got a boo-boo. Don't move.

629
00:43:47,991 --> 00:43:49,481
Oh.

630
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:52,153
- Okay?
- Thank you.

631
00:43:53,763 --> 00:43:56,197
Tazer. Razor.

632
00:43:56,265 --> 00:43:59,132
Sparks. Sparks!

633
00:43:59,202 --> 00:44:02,501
He's critical to mission.

634
00:44:05,908 --> 00:44:08,468
- Nice sounds.
- It's music.

635
00:44:08,544 --> 00:44:12,241
Ooh, music. I try?

636
00:44:12,315 --> 00:44:14,749
Sure.

637
00:44:33,603 --> 00:44:35,264
Yeah!

638
00:44:40,109 --> 00:44:44,773
We've definitely slowed 'em down,
but those buggers adapt fast.

639
00:44:44,847 --> 00:44:47,645
We need to pull out the big guns.

640
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:52,213
Black Cat Whistler or Fire Dragon?

641
00:44:53,623 --> 00:44:56,490
How about not burning down the house?

642
00:45:04,534 --> 00:45:06,593
He's armed! Enemy armed!

643
00:45:06,669 --> 00:45:09,263
Hannah, step away from the alien.

644
00:45:11,507 --> 00:45:14,806
No! Leave him alone! He's my friend.

645
00:45:14,877 --> 00:45:17,141
He was just holding a ray gun to your head.

646
00:45:17,213 --> 00:45:19,579
It's my bubble blower. He fixed it for me.

647
00:45:19,649 --> 00:45:23,346
He's not like the others. Look.

648
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,284
First sign of aggression, I'm taking him out...

649
00:45:27,356 --> 00:45:28,948
with extreme prejudice.

650
00:45:29,025 --> 00:45:31,823
I don't have training for this.
No training.

651
00:45:31,894 --> 00:45:35,022
- It's okay, Mr. Snuggle Lump.
- Snuggle Lump?

652
00:45:35,098 --> 00:45:38,033
- Yeah, that's what I named him.
- My name Sparks.

653
00:45:38,101 --> 00:45:41,628
He's not your pet, Hannah.
He's a freakin' alien.

654
00:45:41,704 --> 00:45:44,172
He's my alien.

655
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,606
Hi.

656
00:45:46,676 --> 00:45:48,303
Aw.

657
00:45:50,012 --> 00:45:52,173
I mean--

658
00:45:52,248 --> 00:45:53,840
Maybe she's right.

659
00:45:53,916 --> 00:45:57,682
I mean, look at his belt.
I think those are tools.

660
00:45:57,754 --> 00:46:02,453
Hey, it's okay, buddy.
We just want to talk to you.

661
00:46:02,525 --> 00:46:05,016
Come on, Snugs.

662
00:46:05,094 --> 00:46:06,891
Back up.

663
00:46:16,939 --> 00:46:19,499
Uh-- Oh.

664
00:46:24,313 --> 00:46:26,747
Watch.

665
00:46:33,723 --> 00:46:36,248
- Awesome.
- How does he do that?

666
00:46:55,845 --> 00:46:57,574
What the heck was that?

667
00:46:57,647 --> 00:47:00,377
Talking about feelings comes with the
territory when you have a girl friend.

668
00:47:00,449 --> 00:47:03,680
There is no loop hole for that one!

669
00:47:03,753 --> 00:47:05,744
Okay. Okay, I get it.

670
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:10,088
You're not gonna talk when I'm yelling.
I'm sorry. It's not mature of me to shout.

671
00:47:11,894 --> 00:47:17,389
Look, I am so, so happy
being your girlfriend.

672
00:47:17,466 --> 00:47:21,129
But if you really care about me
the way that I care about you...

673
00:47:21,204 --> 00:47:24,264
then it shouldn't be a problem
to give me the time that I need.

674
00:47:26,175 --> 00:47:28,268
Maybe you need to think about it.

675
00:47:28,344 --> 00:47:33,281
And I can respect that. Okay?
Take all the time that you want.

676
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:37,285
I'll be here, ready to talk.

677
00:47:40,431 --> 00:47:42,365
With you.

678
00:47:47,805 --> 00:47:49,739
So-So that's how it is?

679
00:47:49,807 --> 00:47:53,868
I'm getting the silent treatment?
Who is in high school now?

680
00:47:58,449 --> 00:48:01,043
- Whoa. Whoa.
- Why are you trying to kill us?

681
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,553
- What's the invasion plan?
- What's your weakness?

682
00:48:03,621 --> 00:48:04,986
- Water?
- Earth germs?

683
00:48:05,056 --> 00:48:06,921
- Women?
- Are there more of you coming?

684
00:48:06,991 --> 00:48:09,152
- We need the information.
- I--

685
00:48:09,227 --> 00:48:11,127
Guys, don't be mean.

686
00:48:11,195 --> 00:48:13,095
Han, we have to interrogate him.

687
00:48:13,164 --> 00:48:15,564
Do you want the world to end? Do ya?

688
00:48:16,734 --> 00:48:18,565
No.

689
00:48:24,008 --> 00:48:25,805
Whoa.

690
00:48:25,877 --> 00:48:28,243
House here. Mission objective here.

691
00:48:28,312 --> 00:48:32,442
What you're after isn't in the basement.
It's under the basement.

692
00:48:32,517 --> 00:48:34,747
- Yes.
- What are you trying to steal from our planet?

693
00:48:34,819 --> 00:48:37,982
Who says it's from our planet?
Look at that thing. It looks alien to me.

694
00:48:38,056 --> 00:48:40,183
It must be from their planet.

695
00:48:40,258 --> 00:48:43,250
- Mmm. 
- Yeah. Planet Fruitcake.

696
00:48:43,327 --> 00:48:46,296
Whatever it is, it's huge.

697
00:48:53,304 --> 00:48:55,295
Almost done.

698
00:48:57,408 --> 00:48:59,603
- So, that's what's in the capsule?
- Ah.

699
00:48:59,677 --> 00:49:02,840
Some kind of giant machine?

700
00:49:02,914 --> 00:49:05,405
Oh, great. A giant alien death machine.

701
00:49:05,483 --> 00:49:08,680
- No one said anything about death.
- I doubt it's a photocopier.

702
00:49:08,753 --> 00:49:12,189
Come on! We can't trust this 4-armed freak.
He's one of them.

703
00:49:12,256 --> 00:49:14,554
He's not.

704
00:49:15,693 --> 00:49:18,685
This guy doesn't fit in with the others.

705
00:49:22,233 --> 00:49:25,669
He's... different.

706
00:49:25,737 --> 00:49:28,399
- Mmm.
- Great. A geek alien.

707
00:49:28,473 --> 00:49:31,499
Jake, he's not a geek.

708
00:49:31,576 --> 00:49:34,044
It's better than a killer alien.

709
00:49:51,662 --> 00:49:54,062
Mm-hmm.

710
00:49:57,769 --> 00:50:01,170
Buenas noches, wrinkles.

711
00:50:06,644 --> 00:50:09,238
Oh, this is ridiculous.

712
00:50:13,284 --> 00:50:15,718
Well, this sucks.

713
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,123
- Modified.
- Whoa.

714
00:50:26,264 --> 00:50:27,697
Sweet.

715
00:50:28,933 --> 00:50:31,265
- Sweet.

716
00:50:33,805 --> 00:50:35,636
Sorry. Huh?

717
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:41,540
- It's the po-po. Be cool.
- Be cool?

718
00:50:41,612 --> 00:50:42,943
Open up!

719
00:50:43,014 --> 00:50:45,574
Oh, crap. We forgot about Nana.

720
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:48,448
- Open the door!
- Hold on. Hannah, quick. Hide your alien.

721
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:50,612
- Open the door now!
- Snugs.

722
00:50:50,688 --> 00:50:53,054
Get in!

723
00:50:53,124 --> 00:50:54,989
Hold on a second.

724
00:50:55,059 --> 00:50:58,756
Children of my children, I request entry.

725
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:01,355
I have candied sweets.

726
00:51:01,432 --> 00:51:03,992
Don't open it. That's not Nana.

727
00:51:04,068 --> 00:51:06,696
Are you sure?

728
00:51:10,007 --> 00:51:13,408
Yeah, I'm sure.

729
00:51:13,477 --> 00:51:17,777
Surrender Engineer Sparks now.

730
00:51:17,849 --> 00:51:20,477
- Nana-- Nana--
- Out of my way, Earth children!

731
00:51:20,551 --> 00:51:22,678
- Move!
- Nana, don't make me hurt you.

732
00:51:22,753 --> 00:51:24,584
Nana, uh--

733
00:51:29,827 --> 00:51:31,761
Ew!

734
00:51:31,829 --> 00:51:33,922
Return him to me.

735
00:51:33,998 --> 00:51:37,434
Tom, do something!

736
00:51:45,109 --> 00:51:48,272
Ew. Gross. Human

737
00:51:50,615 --> 00:51:52,139
Someone's gotta get the door.

738
00:51:52,216 --> 00:51:55,515
- We can't let the cops in here. It's too dangerous. 
- Here's Nana!

739
00:51:55,586 --> 00:51:58,646
- Hey! Leave my Nana alone!
- Silence, squeaky-voiced human child!

740
00:52:01,092 --> 00:52:03,026
I got Nana's controller!

741
00:52:04,228 --> 00:52:06,560
Free me! Free me, or face the consequence!

742
00:52:06,631 --> 00:52:10,965
- In here.
- You don't trap me! I trap you! Why, you--

743
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:15,170
- Shake all you want. We own you.

744
00:52:16,574 --> 00:52:19,543
The suitcase! Go!

745
00:52:23,447 --> 00:52:25,005
Ha! You missed me.

746
00:52:25,082 --> 00:52:27,812
- Stand still, Earth burgers!

747
00:52:27,885 --> 00:52:29,546
Ha! Got him!

748
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:32,316
Don't let 'em take Snuggle Lump!

749
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:34,415
Art, wait!

750
00:52:34,492 --> 00:52:37,154
- Shoot him! Shoot the humans!
- Incoming!

751
00:52:37,228 --> 00:52:40,425
- Shoot 'em up!
- Hit the deck!

752
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:45,091
- You lose.
- Zirkon forever!

753
00:52:47,438 --> 00:52:50,236
I'm sorry, Hannah. I'm sorry. They got him.

754
00:52:51,075 --> 00:52:53,771
- Sweet, huh?
- Very nice.

755
00:52:53,844 --> 00:52:56,244
This is the Creek Landing
Sheriff's Department.

756
00:52:56,314 --> 00:53:00,114
Open this door at once,
or I will begin forcible entry...

757
00:53:00,184 --> 00:53:02,118
in 10, 9...

758
00:53:02,186 --> 00:53:05,587
- 8, 7, 6... You guys get rid of the cop.
I'm going after the aliens.

759
00:53:05,656 --> 00:53:07,851
5, 4--

760
00:53:07,925 --> 00:53:10,894
- We can't leave him up here.
- 2, 1.

761
00:53:10,962 --> 00:53:14,489
I don't know how much you kids
know about penal codes...

762
00:53:14,565 --> 00:53:18,057
but making phone calls with the intent
to annoy or harass is a serious offense.

763
00:53:18,135 --> 00:53:21,935
It's called criminal mischief.
And it could mean 6 months in jail.

764
00:53:22,006 --> 00:53:24,998
911 is for emergency calls only.

765
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:29,103
- Any misuse of this system compromises this county's... 
- Oh, weapons.

766
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:32,377
only line of defense, and that's me.

767
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:34,577
Around here, I am the law.

768
00:53:34,652 --> 00:53:38,144
Literally, I'm the only one.
My deputy's on maternity leave.

769
00:53:38,222 --> 00:53:41,487
Look, Sheriff, we told you we're sorry.
It won't happen again.

770
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:43,493
So, really, you can leave now.
We'll be good.

771
00:53:43,561 --> 00:53:46,997
Oh, I can leave?
Okay, we got the whole problem solved.

772
00:53:50,201 --> 00:53:52,431
- Hey, what's that there?

773
00:53:52,503 --> 00:53:55,495
Squadron, come in. Come in.
Do you have Sparks?

774
00:53:55,573 --> 00:53:59,009
- No. - Is there any job
you two can't screw up?

775
00:53:59,076 --> 00:54:01,840
- Come in!

776
00:54:01,912 --> 00:54:04,346
I'm sorry. I apologize. That was uncalled for.

777
00:54:04,415 --> 00:54:08,283
- You're still trapped in that box, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

778
00:54:08,352 --> 00:54:11,412
- Step aside, young man.
- No need for that.

779
00:54:11,489 --> 00:54:16,085
It's just my sister's robot dog.
It's sound activated. Right, Han?

780
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,822
Right. It's not an alien.

781
00:54:18,896 --> 00:54:21,091
Mm-hmm.

782
00:54:21,165 --> 00:54:25,158
You know what? I'm gonna take a look
inside that chest, so please step aside.

783
00:54:36,947 --> 00:54:40,610
It's the po-po. Be cool.

784
00:54:42,219 --> 00:54:45,279
One hour. We're gone one hour.
What happened? What'd you kids do?

785
00:54:45,356 --> 00:54:47,790
Hi. Nina Pearson. Are you kids okay?

786
00:54:47,858 --> 00:54:50,122
- Is everything okay?
- No, ma'am.

787
00:54:50,194 --> 00:54:54,961
I'd say making a fraudulent call to 911 about
an alien invasion is most definitely not okay.

788
00:54:55,032 --> 00:54:57,227
- You called 911?
- Come on, buddy.

789
00:54:57,301 --> 00:55:01,067
I'm sure you can let these kids off
with a warning. Look at 'em.

790
00:55:01,138 --> 00:55:03,572
1, not your buddy.

791
00:55:03,641 --> 00:55:07,202
2, notice that your vehicle
is missing a front license plate.

792
00:55:07,278 --> 00:55:10,543
- 3, how about I write you up a ticket?
- How about you don't?

793
00:55:10,614 --> 00:55:12,673
Nate, stop talking.

794
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:15,776
You people usually leave your
children unsupervised like this?

795
00:55:15,853 --> 00:55:18,913
No. No, not at all.
We had to go into town to the leasing office.

796
00:55:18,989 --> 00:55:21,014
They shut our power off.

797
00:55:21,092 --> 00:55:23,356
Looks all right to me.

798
00:55:23,427 --> 00:55:26,453
Sheriff, I know this isn't
something to be taken lightly...

799
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:28,589
but honestly, they are really good kids.

800
00:55:28,666 --> 00:55:31,829
Why don't you stay and see for yourself?
We're barbecuing.

801
00:55:31,902 --> 00:55:34,200
-Join us.
- Mom--

802
00:55:34,271 --> 00:55:36,501
Thank you, ma'am.
I'd like to, but I am on duty.

803
00:55:36,574 --> 00:55:40,874
Look. The kids made a big mistake.
And I assure you, Tom will be punished.

804
00:55:40,945 --> 00:55:43,880
But my wife is right. We got plenty
of great food. Why don't you stick around?

805
00:55:43,948 --> 00:55:47,543
I know you`re on the job, but there's no law
against a home-cooked meal.

806
00:55:47,618 --> 00:55:52,385
Got lots of hot dogs, hamburgers, steaks and--

807
00:55:52,456 --> 00:55:54,481
Hmm.

808
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,821
Okay.

809
00:56:02,533 --> 00:56:04,398
I have to admit, it has been a while.

810
00:56:04,468 --> 00:56:06,800
- All right. Arm successfully twisted.
- Great.

811
00:56:06,871 --> 00:56:09,533
I guess an hour off won't kill anyone.

812
00:56:09,607 --> 00:56:11,768
- No.

813
00:56:11,842 --> 00:56:14,106
Gotcha.

814
00:56:14,178 --> 00:56:15,873
- Hey!
- Huh?

815
00:56:15,946 --> 00:56:18,312
Oh.

816
00:56:18,382 --> 00:56:20,282
What was that?

817
00:56:20,351 --> 00:56:22,819
- What was what?
- I don't know. I felt something.

818
00:56:22,887 --> 00:56:24,821
- Come on, everyone. Dinner.
- Let me help you with the bags.

819
00:56:24,889 --> 00:56:26,789
Inside. I've got the desserts.

820
00:56:32,363 --> 00:56:34,831
- You're going down, punk!
- You're going down, punk.

821
00:56:34,899 --> 00:56:36,833
- I just said that.
- I just said that.

822
00:56:36,901 --> 00:56:39,927
- Stop that.
- Stop that.

823
00:56:43,707 --> 00:56:45,607
- You've been punked.

824
00:56:48,312 --> 00:56:50,780
- Hail Zirkonia.
- Ow!

825
00:56:55,553 --> 00:56:59,512
Okay, now hold on, Mom.
I'm not following. Now, what happened?

826
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:01,785
One moment I'm cleaning my chompers...

827
00:57:01,859 --> 00:57:05,056
and then the next thing
you know, I'm down here.

828
00:57:05,129 --> 00:57:07,996
You know, you're entitled
to a few senior moments at your age.

829
00:57:08,065 --> 00:57:10,363
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forgot.
Did you want cheese on your burger?

830
00:57:10,434 --> 00:57:14,871
No. I want to find whoever invented love
and hack him apart with a machete.

831
00:57:17,808 --> 00:57:20,606
- Boy trouble.
- That makes 2 of us.

832
00:57:20,678 --> 00:57:25,547
- I don't know what to do about this Tom situation.
- We have a guest. Happy face.

833
00:57:25,616 --> 00:57:28,983
- Hey, Nate, where's Jake?
- I have no idea.

834
00:57:29,053 --> 00:57:31,783
Well, dinner's almost ready.
How about you track him down?

835
00:57:31,855 --> 00:57:35,723
Jake's an adult.
If he wants to eat, he'll come down and get it.

836
00:57:35,793 --> 00:57:38,557
- Oh, sorry.
- That will raise welts.

837
00:57:38,629 --> 00:57:42,531
- Excuse us.
- No. Pardon me. Oops. Watch your head.

838
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,329
Mmm-mmm-mm.

839
00:57:44,401 --> 00:57:47,131
I tell you, there's nothing more American
than a charred chunk of meat...

840
00:57:47,204 --> 00:57:49,138
hittin' your stomach.

841
00:57:49,206 --> 00:57:51,140
- I bought the pickles.
- Oh, really?

842
00:57:51,208 --> 00:57:55,167
If you think a dill spear is gonna get you
out of that ticket, it's a no-go, mister.

843
00:58:04,288 --> 00:58:06,552
Uh--

844
00:58:07,758 --> 00:58:09,692
My stomach. I'm starving.

845
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,752
- Any word from Jake?
- Still no signal.

846
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:14,991
- Where is he?
- Hey, boys. None of that at the table.

847
00:58:15,065 --> 00:58:18,728
Right, Nate?
They're playing with their phones.

848
00:58:18,802 --> 00:58:21,396
Oh, yeah. Slap it on.

849
00:58:25,342 --> 00:58:29,108
Hey, Hannah, did you eat all the hot dogs?

850
00:58:29,179 --> 00:58:31,340
- No.

851
00:58:31,415 --> 00:58:33,542
I mean, yes.

852
00:58:35,419 --> 00:58:39,355
Gotta tell ya, this sure beats
eating ramen noodles in my squad car...

853
00:58:39,423 --> 00:58:42,187
Everyday by myself

854
00:58:43,827 --> 00:58:46,125
Comfortable up there, Earth boy?

855
00:58:46,196 --> 00:58:48,596
- Hope so.
- Enjoy some dirt in your face.

856
00:58:48,666 --> 00:58:50,861
Help!

857
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:55,934
Attention, all.
Resistance is futile. Give me what I need.

858
00:58:56,006 --> 00:58:58,770
Oh, baby. I knew you'd come back.

859
00:58:58,842 --> 00:59:00,742
Step aside, hormonal female.

860
00:59:00,811 --> 00:59:03,109
Wait. You're calling me hormonal?

861
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:06,206
Back away.
You are irrelevant to my mission.

862
00:59:06,283 --> 00:59:07,944
Irrelevant?

863
00:59:08,018 --> 00:59:11,317
I don't care how old you are.
You can't talk to me like that!

864
00:59:11,388 --> 00:59:13,754
What is going on?

865
00:59:13,824 --> 00:59:15,416
Teen drama. I-I think.

866
00:59:15,492 --> 00:59:17,824
It is teen drama, right, Ricky?

867
00:59:17,895 --> 00:59:19,760
- Snuggles!
- Turn him off.

868
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:22,560
- It's not me.
- Snuggles!

869
00:59:22,633 --> 00:59:25,761
- Let's move. Bring Nana.
- Whoa, whoa. Freeze.

870
00:59:27,538 --> 00:59:30,735
You kids have not been excused.

871
00:59:30,808 --> 00:59:33,140
Let them go!

872
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:37,909
We're playin' a game, Uncle Stu-- I mean, Stu.

873
00:59:37,981 --> 00:59:42,008
We're on vacation. Am I aging backwards?

874
00:59:42,086 --> 00:59:46,648
Yeah, I don't think so. You really want
to deny me my time with the kids?

875
00:59:46,724 --> 00:59:50,319
Wow. Guilt never gets old. Well, go ahead.

876
00:59:54,098 --> 00:59:57,761
I think we oughta keep Mom
out of the pinot grigio.

877
01:00:15,386 --> 01:00:19,982
You have lost.
And now the invasion shall begin.

878
01:00:20,057 --> 01:00:22,491
Invasion? You mean there's
more of you guys coming?

879
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:26,325
Many more. And we will crush you like bugs.

880
01:00:26,397 --> 01:00:30,128
- Not if we crush you first.
- I will not be beaten by children.

881
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:35,137
Anymore signs of resistance,
and the one you call Jake will be eliminated.

882
01:00:36,306 --> 01:00:39,002
- I want Snuggle Lump back!
- That's it.

883
01:00:39,076 --> 01:00:41,010
Time to die.

884
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:45,048
Richard?

885
01:00:45,115 --> 01:00:47,106
You remember Nana.

886
01:00:48,085 --> 01:00:49,677
Game on.

887
01:00:49,753 --> 01:00:51,846
Game over.

888
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,925
Wow.

889
01:01:13,143 --> 01:01:17,443
- Whoa! What was that move?
- Double right-thumb click with a left-panel twist.

890
01:01:18,649 --> 01:01:20,412
Chinese get up!

891
01:01:24,688 --> 01:01:27,088
He's on the light! Send Nana after him!

892
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:32,720
- Nana!
- Lee! Flying's your specialty.

893
01:01:54,184 --> 01:01:56,118
Ooh. Take him out, Lee.

894
01:01:56,186 --> 01:01:59,212
- Thumb cramp. Thumb cramp!
- Give it to me.

895
01:02:18,542 --> 01:02:20,976
- Ricky?
- What the--

896
01:02:24,581 --> 01:02:26,640
Nana?

897
01:02:35,993 --> 01:02:39,451
Yes, scream, human,
for your species ends tonight.

898
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,266
What the heck was that thing?

899
01:02:45,335 --> 01:02:48,702
Space alien. Too much to explain.

900
01:02:48,772 --> 01:02:51,605
We think they're probably here
to destroy the world as we know it.

901
01:02:51,675 --> 01:02:54,542
If we don't get down there,
we're gonna be in real trouble.

902
01:02:54,611 --> 01:02:57,011
I'd say that's the
understatement of the century.

903
01:02:58,916 --> 01:03:01,043
Mom? Are you okay?

904
01:03:03,186 --> 01:03:08,146
What-- What happened?
How-- How did I get--

905
01:03:08,225 --> 01:03:10,853
- Oh, I need a glass of water.
- Uh--

906
01:03:10,928 --> 01:03:13,556
Okay. Somebody better start talking.

907
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:17,498
It looks like you guys
had a battle royal in here.

908
01:03:17,568 --> 01:03:20,002
- We did. Nana versus Ricky.
- Not now, Hannah.

909
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:23,164
- Dad, it's not what it looks like.
- All of you, upstairs, now.

910
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:26,004
- But, Uncle Stu, it wasn't our fault.
- Now.

911
01:03:29,646 --> 01:03:31,739
Get up.

912
01:03:31,815 --> 01:03:35,410
Okay, unless you wanna join them,
you better spill it.

913
01:03:35,485 --> 01:03:37,680
What the heck happened in here?

914
01:03:37,754 --> 01:03:39,847
I haven't got a clue as to what happened...

915
01:03:39,923 --> 01:03:43,415
but my back hasn't felt this good in ages.

916
01:03:45,128 --> 01:03:47,858
Mom? Mom? Where you goin'?

917
01:03:47,931 --> 01:03:50,024
Aliens.

918
01:03:58,842 --> 01:04:01,743
Build machine... now.

919
01:04:01,812 --> 01:04:03,939
No.

920
01:04:12,189 --> 01:04:14,419
I'm sorry, guys.

921
01:04:15,692 --> 01:04:17,626
It's over.

922
01:04:17,694 --> 01:04:20,185
Over? It better not be over.

923
01:04:20,263 --> 01:04:25,360
Ricky is down in the basement
with that... space rodent.

924
01:04:25,435 --> 01:04:28,802
You don't get it. An entire fleet
of those guys are about to invade.

925
01:04:28,872 --> 01:04:31,033
Well, man up and deal with it.

926
01:04:31,108 --> 01:04:33,770
I have been... all day.

927
01:04:33,844 --> 01:04:36,938
Well, if hes too scared,
maybe you guys can help me.

928
01:04:37,014 --> 01:04:40,609
- Not without Tom.
- Why?

929
01:04:40,684 --> 01:04:42,208
'Cause he's our leader.

930
01:04:44,321 --> 01:04:48,724
Come on. It's not just Ricky.
Jake needs your help too.

931
01:04:48,792 --> 01:04:50,783
And Snuggles.

932
01:04:50,861 --> 01:04:53,796
And, like, everyone on Earth,
including our parents.

933
01:05:03,573 --> 01:05:05,234
All right.

934
01:05:05,308 --> 01:05:07,936
Let's go save the planet.

935
01:05:08,879 --> 01:05:12,110
And your dumb old boyfriend.

936
01:05:41,712 --> 01:05:44,840
You want Monkey? He's good luck.

937
01:05:46,516 --> 01:05:48,507
I'm fine.

938
01:05:51,188 --> 01:05:53,452
Stay close.

939
01:05:53,523 --> 01:05:56,151
They could be anywhere.

940
01:06:32,763 --> 01:06:34,856
It's Jake!

941
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:39,897
Those Zirkonians--
They tied me up and dragged Snuggles outside.

942
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:41,904
This vacation really sucks.

943
01:06:41,972 --> 01:06:44,839
- You see the machine?
- Yeah. You were right. It was sent here years ago.

944
01:06:44,908 --> 01:06:47,001
Some idiot built this place
smack on top of it.

945
01:06:47,077 --> 01:06:49,443
Guys? Guys, I found Ricky.

946
01:06:49,513 --> 01:06:51,913
- He's waking up.
- Where in the heck am I?

947
01:06:51,982 --> 01:06:55,042
Oh, baby, I'm so glad youre okay.

948
01:06:55,786 --> 01:06:58,254
Whoa! Don't touch me!

949
01:07:00,257 --> 01:07:01,884
- Stop.
- Okay, okay.

950
01:07:01,958 --> 01:07:06,418
I know it's been a really weird day,
but you have to let me explain.

951
01:07:06,496 --> 01:07:09,727
Okay. Okay.

952
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:13,429
Explain to me why I keep blacking out,
why I'm bleeding...

953
01:07:13,503 --> 01:07:17,940
and why your grandma did
a flying ninja kick on my face down the stairs.

954
01:07:18,008 --> 01:07:20,101
Okay.

955
01:07:20,177 --> 01:07:23,271
We're fighting, um, space aliens.

956
01:07:23,346 --> 01:07:24,870
Yeah. Yeah.

957
01:07:24,948 --> 01:07:28,782
Okay, they're small,
but dangerous and-- and really scary.

958
01:07:28,852 --> 01:07:31,286
Oh, no. Of course.
I believe you. Why wouldn't they be?

959
01:07:31,354 --> 01:07:35,415
Why do you want to waste our time
playing hide-and-seek and kill the aliens...

960
01:07:35,492 --> 01:07:37,960
with your stupid brother
and your dumb little cousins?

961
01:07:41,531 --> 01:07:43,624
Don't talk about my family like that.

962
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:47,261
Well, you don't have to worry about it anymore
'cause we're done.

963
01:07:47,337 --> 01:07:50,932
I knew I should have stayed home
and hooked up with Annie Filkins.

964
01:07:51,007 --> 01:07:54,306
She's smokin' hot, and she doesn't like
talking about feelings all the time.

965
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:57,772
I'm goin' straight to Annie's.

966
01:08:01,351 --> 01:08:03,285
Ow.

967
01:08:07,891 --> 01:08:10,291
I'm really sorry.

968
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,193
Don't be. You were right all along.

969
01:08:13,263 --> 01:08:17,324
If its any consolation,
he's not going straight to Annie's.

970
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,334
Or anywhere for a while.

971
01:08:19,402 --> 01:08:21,734
Wow.

972
01:08:21,805 --> 01:08:24,831
Guys? Enough of this sibling bonding.
We're at DEFCON 1 here.

973
01:08:31,281 --> 01:08:35,012
Go. Go! Rookie.

974
01:08:36,553 --> 01:08:40,319
Oh, my God. They're forcing him to build it.

975
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:43,359
Build what? How do you take over
the world with that thing?

976
01:08:43,426 --> 01:08:46,623
I really don't want to find out.
We gotta stop them before their fleet arrives.

977
01:08:46,696 --> 01:08:49,494
- Fleet?
- This is just the advance team.

978
01:08:49,566 --> 01:08:52,228
- We have to rescue Snuggle Lump.
- Snuggle what?

979
01:08:52,302 --> 01:08:55,362
Lump. The foreign fella. He's on our side.

980
01:08:55,438 --> 01:08:58,407
The other 3-- not so much.

981
01:08:58,475 --> 01:09:01,911
- This is so not happening.
- We gotta get out there. Let's move.

982
01:09:01,978 --> 01:09:06,915
Not so fast. I have a plan. Work with
me here. Did Nana give anyone Mentos?

983
01:09:06,983 --> 01:09:08,917
- Why?
- Hand 'em over!

984
01:09:08,985 --> 01:09:12,182
- What, we're gonna throw candy at them?
- No.

985
01:09:12,255 --> 01:09:14,553
My own little science project.

986
01:09:21,131 --> 01:09:23,258
Mentos bomb. You're a genius.

987
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:25,164
You shouldn't do this.

988
01:09:25,235 --> 01:09:27,897
- Humans friendly. Whoa!
- Incoming!

989
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:31,930
In my eyes!

990
01:09:32,008 --> 01:09:33,532
- Let's get 'em!
- Move!

991
01:09:36,346 --> 01:09:39,372
- Snuggles!
- Traitor.

992
01:09:42,352 --> 01:09:45,947
- Release me.
- Never mess with a girl who just got dumped.

993
01:09:48,758 --> 01:09:51,591
He's out cold.

994
01:09:51,661 --> 01:09:54,221
- You!
- Get off my planet, you little green son of a--

995
01:10:09,813 --> 01:10:13,271
- How do you feel now?
- Weakness-- We found their weakness!

996
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:16,751
- It's their own death ray.
- Yes!

997
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:21,018
Bad. Not sweet. So not sweet.

998
01:10:26,029 --> 01:10:28,395
- Hey! Humans.
- Hey, listen.

999
01:10:28,465 --> 01:10:33,300
The machine molecule expands.
Machine make commander big.

1000
01:10:38,308 --> 01:10:41,937
Who's little now, Earth maggots?

1001
01:10:42,012 --> 01:10:46,005
- Pretty cool, huh?
- You're gonna need a bigger potato.

1002
01:10:46,082 --> 01:10:48,550
It's over. I win.

1003
01:10:48,618 --> 01:10:51,610
- Where's he going?
- Anywhere he wants.

1004
01:10:51,688 --> 01:10:54,589
- What about Mommy and Daddy?
- Tom will figure it out.

1005
01:11:06,503 --> 01:11:08,698
Everyone, listen. We don't have much time.

1006
01:11:08,772 --> 01:11:11,332
- Sparks, can anything go on that machine?
- Theoretically.

1007
01:11:11,408 --> 01:11:13,706
Good. Art, Lee, I'm gonna need a controller.

1008
01:11:13,777 --> 01:11:16,109
- Bethany, I need you to keep the
other aliens on lockdown.   - Okay.

1009
01:11:19,182 --> 01:11:21,116
Jake, come on.

1010
01:11:21,184 --> 01:11:23,550
- This battle's not over yet.
- Awesome.

1011
01:11:25,755 --> 01:11:27,655
There.

1012
01:11:27,724 --> 01:11:30,158
Cool. He super-sized it.

1013
01:11:31,561 --> 01:11:33,654
You are one ugly alien.

1014
01:11:36,866 --> 01:11:39,494
He may be ugly, but he's mine.

1015
01:11:39,569 --> 01:11:41,560
You don't know when to quit, do you?

1016
01:11:44,607 --> 01:11:47,701
- We need a clean shot at his neck.
- I'm goin' up.

1017
01:11:53,616 --> 01:11:58,019
- Ow! You broke my nail!
- I don't care.

1018
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:05,357
Whoa!

1019
01:12:09,566 --> 01:12:13,400
- Ah!
- Oh, my gosh. They're beacons.

1020
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:15,370
He's calling the invasion.

1021
01:12:17,307 --> 01:12:19,104
[Stuart]
Wow.

1022
01:12:19,175 --> 01:12:21,700
- Unbelievable.
- Look at this.

1023
01:12:21,778 --> 01:12:25,680
God bless America.
Now that's what I call a patriot act.

1024
01:12:25,748 --> 01:12:28,876
It's not bad,
but it's nothin' compared to this.

1025
01:12:28,952 --> 01:12:32,911
Whoa, whoa. Those are category-3
pyrotechnics you got there.

1026
01:12:32,989 --> 01:12:35,014
I suppose that's another ticket.

1027
01:12:37,193 --> 01:12:39,787
Light 'em up. Let's put that guy to shame.

1028
01:12:42,599 --> 01:12:44,965
I got it! Tom! Tom, I found it.

1029
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:50,205
Get him to turn around!

1030
01:12:50,273 --> 01:12:54,642
Hey! Down here, you prehistoric space scum!

1031
01:13:00,049 --> 01:13:02,745
- Ooh.
- Nice one, Nate.

1032
01:13:02,819 --> 01:13:07,984
That was awesome! Those things
only cost $1.99. Can you believe it?

1033
01:13:08,057 --> 01:13:11,390
- I don't think that's you, Nate.
- What is that?

1034
01:13:11,461 --> 01:13:15,955
It's them. They'll all be coming soon.

1035
01:13:16,032 --> 01:13:18,592
Open your eyes, people.

1036
01:13:18,668 --> 01:13:21,466
There's only one answer-- meteor shower.

1037
01:13:21,538 --> 01:13:25,497
- Oh, that's right. I heard on the radio.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1038
01:13:29,913 --> 01:13:33,110
Is that all ya got?

1039
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:37,313
- Hey.
- Come on!

1040
01:13:38,421 --> 01:13:40,981
Tom! Take the shot!

1041
01:13:41,057 --> 01:13:44,823
- Shoot him!
- His collar's still in the way.

1042
01:13:44,894 --> 01:13:48,421
Look out! The ugly one got big!

1043
01:13:48,498 --> 01:13:52,559
- Hurry. Do it, Tom!
- 50 yards.

1044
01:13:52,635 --> 01:13:56,833
Angle equals one-half arc sine of gravity
times distance over velocity squared.

1045
01:13:56,906 --> 01:13:59,204
45 degrees.

1046
01:13:59,275 --> 01:14:01,709
What was that?

1047
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:06,940
You messed with the wrong mathlete.

1048
01:14:16,092 --> 01:14:17,684
- Yes.
- Get him away from him.

1049
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,092
Commander. Hey, wait a second.

1050
01:14:21,931 --> 01:14:24,399
Take that.

1051
01:14:24,467 --> 01:14:27,459
- Puny humans, is that all you have?
- Whoa, he's good.

1052
01:14:31,407 --> 01:14:33,398
No, you don't.

1053
01:14:34,877 --> 01:14:36,742
You see that?

1054
01:14:36,813 --> 01:14:39,839
Sparks! Reverse the machine.

1055
01:14:50,627 --> 01:14:53,095
- Too easy.
- Uh--

1056
01:14:55,431 --> 01:14:57,592
- Nothing's working.
- Give it to me.

1057
01:15:01,337 --> 01:15:03,567
- Crude.
- But effective.

1058
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,540
That was awesome.

1059
01:15:08,444 --> 01:15:11,208
- Reversed.
- Tommy, he's done.

1060
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:26,288
- You came back for me.
- Let's go.

1061
01:15:26,362 --> 01:15:28,922
We can hug lips on Zirkon.

1062
01:15:36,105 --> 01:15:37,902
Whoa!

1063
01:15:39,242 --> 01:15:41,210
Bethany!

1064
01:15:41,277 --> 01:15:42,767
- Hannah, are you okay?
- Yeah.

1065
01:15:42,845 --> 01:15:45,279
Over here.
Did you guys see that? Great job, Hannah.

1066
01:15:45,348 --> 01:15:48,875
- Snugs was great. So were you guys.
- Tom, what about the others?

1067
01:15:48,951 --> 01:15:51,886
There's so many.

1068
01:15:58,127 --> 01:16:01,426
Retreat. Retreat. The machine is destroyed.

1069
01:16:01,497 --> 01:16:05,092
We have been outsmarted by the humans.

1070
01:16:05,168 --> 01:16:09,264
The invasion has failed.
Retreat to Zirkon right away.

1071
01:16:09,339 --> 01:16:12,467
Retreat. Retreat.

1072
01:16:15,211 --> 01:16:18,146
Whoa.

1073
01:16:19,949 --> 01:16:22,782
He's gone.

1074
01:16:22,852 --> 01:16:26,447
It's over. It's all over.

1075
01:16:26,522 --> 01:16:28,456
We won.

1076
01:16:30,626 --> 01:16:33,493
Thanks, Snugs, for everything.

1077
01:16:33,563 --> 01:16:36,657
You're all right for a space maggot.
I'm gonna miss you.

1078
01:16:36,733 --> 01:16:40,328
Miss him? He's staying here, with us.

1079
01:16:41,571 --> 01:16:44,369
Please don't go.
You can be a part of our family.

1080
01:16:57,186 --> 01:17:00,553
Han, I think he's already got a family.

1081
01:17:02,959 --> 01:17:04,950
My family.

1082
01:17:15,204 --> 01:17:17,729
Good-bye, Hannah.

1083
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:06,179
Hey.

1084
01:18:06,255 --> 01:18:08,246
Hey.

1085
01:18:10,993 --> 01:18:15,157
- Listen, about your grades--
- Dad, let me save you a lecture.

1086
01:18:15,231 --> 01:18:18,064
You were right, and I was wrong.

1087
01:18:18,134 --> 01:18:22,127
Turns out there are advantages
to being smart.

1088
01:18:23,539 --> 01:18:25,530
I'm sorry.

1089
01:18:27,376 --> 01:18:29,503
I had this really great lecture planned.

1090
01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:32,707
Even rehearsed it in front of the mirror.

1091
01:18:38,688 --> 01:18:40,622
Did you see the meteor shower?

1092
01:18:40,690 --> 01:18:42,954
Yeah. Yeah, it was life-changing.

1093
01:18:48,231 --> 01:18:51,223
- Nice cast, Nana.
- Hey.

1094
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:54,326
Whoa, whoa! Got a bite. Got a bite.

1095
01:18:54,403 --> 01:18:56,928
Oh, yeah. Come on.

1096
01:19:12,388 --> 01:19:16,324
You're out of this world, I'm sure

1097
01:19:18,661 --> 01:19:22,028
- Annie!
- Ricky, I thought you were at your lake house.

1098
01:19:22,098 --> 01:19:25,363
- Vacation ended early. These are for you.
- You're so sweet.

1099
01:19:25,434 --> 01:19:27,493
Hey, you're my girlfriend now.

1100
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:30,869
So there is nothing I wouldn't do for you.
Now give papa some--

1101
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:35,138
Hoo-hoo-hoo! Ladies.

1102
01:19:35,211 --> 01:19:37,509
It's girls' night out.
But, hey, you should come--

1103
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:41,744
- If you like dancing.
- Dancing?

1104
01:19:41,817 --> 01:19:44,012
You ain't even seen dancing--

1105
01:19:44,086 --> 01:19:47,146
Till you've seen funky Ricky.

1106
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:59,964
Wedgie time.

1107
01:20:00,036 --> 01:20:01,663
Cannonball.

1108
01:20:01,737 --> 01:20:03,466
I think he's hungry.

1109
01:20:06,642 --> 01:20:08,940
Turn him off.

1110
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:12,673
Ricky, you're acting really weird.

1111
01:20:12,748 --> 01:20:15,148
What are you talking about?

1112
01:20:15,217 --> 01:20:17,082
Okay, now back on.

1113
01:20:28,064 --> 01:20:29,895
I am so keeping this.

1114
01:20:29,966 --> 01:20:33,231
Why?

1115
01:20:33,302 --> 01:20:37,432
Hey, so strange
You switched in front of me

1116
01:20:37,506 --> 01:20:41,704
<i>* Hey, you've changed
Not like you used to be</i>

1117
01:20:41,777 --> 01:20:43,870
<i>* 'Cause you get in my head
and hold my heart</i>

1118
01:20:43,946 --> 01:20:46,039
<i>* When I'm here, you're there
We're worlds apart</i>

1119
01:20:46,115 --> 01:20:50,609
<i>* So reverse your words back to the start
and switch back to my world</i>

1120
01:20:50,686 --> 01:20:54,884
<i>* Hey, you're just talking like a machine</i>

1121
01:20:54,957 --> 01:20:59,155
<i>* Hey, I'm stuck on everyone in between</i>

1122
01:20:59,228 --> 01:21:01,253
<i>* 'Cause you get in my head and hold my heart</i>

1123

<i>* You're out of this world
I'm sure of it</i>

1126
01:21:16,445 --> 01:21:18,811
<i>* A crazy intuition</i>

1127
01:21:18,881 --> 01:21:22,715
<i>* You're off and on
You're here, then gone</i>

1128
01:21:22,785 --> 01:21:25,219
<i>* Come back</i>

1129
01:21:25,287 --> 01:21:27,414
<i>* A curious condition</i>

1130
01:21:27,490 --> 01:21:30,755
<i>* And then you switch right over</i>

1131
01:21:30,826 --> 01:21:32,760
<i>* It's weird
Yeah, I know</i>

1132
01:21:32,828 --> 01:21:36,423
<i>* But just can't get a hold of myself</i>

1133
01:21:36,499 --> 01:21:40,629

1144

<i>* A little more than different</i>

1145
01:22:22,144 --> 01:22:26,774
<i>* And you keep lacking
lacking concern for it</i>

1146
01:22:28,551 --> 01:22:30,781
<i>* It's you that I am missing</i>

1147

1161
01:23:19,401 --> 01:23:23,565
<i>* Staring at the stars falling behind you</i>

1162
01:23:23,639 --> 01:23:28,042
<i>* Across the universe
Hope you'll be back soon</i>

1163
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:31,546

I'll rearrange it</i>
