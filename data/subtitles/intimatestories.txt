{15928}{15975}Tell me, dad,|are you nuts?
{16048}{16143}You can't go to San Julian,|you can't even go pee alone.
{16216}{16263}Sit down and|drink "mate".
{16336}{16407}- What's wrong with him?|- With who?
{16432}{16479}With your dad.
{16504}{16527}He's odd.
{16576}{16623}He's been there|for an hour.
{16648}{16695}He's not odd, he's nuts.
{16720}{16789}- Did he say anything? - Yes,|he wants to go to San Julian.
{16792}{16885}- What for? - It seems|somebody saw Uglyface.
{16888}{16957}- Uglyface, that dog!|- That's a lie.
{16960}{17031}- What did you tell him?|- Nothing. That he's nuts.

{18112}{18135}Here.
{18448}{18495}What's wrong with|you, Justo?
{18544}{18567}Nothing.
{18592}{18639}You looked weird|this evening.
{18688}{18711}Me weird?
{18760}{18807}- Yes, you. - No,|I wasn't weird.
{18880}{18951}Come on, I know you,|don't lie to me.
{19048}{19071}What's|wrong?
{19120}{19165}Gonzalez stopped|by and...
{19168}{19237}...he told me he saw|Uglyface in San Julian.
{19240}{19311}Dad, I'm sure the dog|is not Uglyface.
{19360}{19383}Yes.
{19456}{19503}Probably you're right.
{19600}{19671}He's not worthwhile|such a long trip.
{19768}{19815}I told Carlos|I'd go get him.
{19840}{19885}I must be crazy.
{19888}{19957}I told you San Julian|is too far away, dad.
{19960}{20007}I must be getting old.
{23824}{23919}- Who is it? - Your coat|is ready, sir. - Coming.
{24040}{24133}- Sir... - Yes? - We couldn't|get the same button.
{24136}{24205}- You couldn't get the|same one. - No, sir.
{24208}{24301}- Is it so hard to get a|similar one? - It is, sir.
{24304}{24351}But... It's okay, okay.
{24856}{24901}- Good morning.|- Good morning.
{24904}{24949}I want my|breakfast, quick.
{24952}{25021}- Want some doughnuts?|- No, bring me some toast.
{25024}{25119}- Today is a special day, at 6 I|must be in San Julian. - Yes, sir.
{25192}{25261}- Garcia, how are you?|- Hi, Alberto.
{25264}{25333}- It seems we're meeting|all the time. - It does.
{25336}{25407}- I saw you 2 days ago.|- Yes, right.
{25432}{25525}- Did you go on holidays?|- No, I can't afford it.
{25528}{25621}In this business holidays|have disppeared, Garcia.
{25624}{25693}- That's true.|- How's your company?
{25696}{25789}So so. When the owner of|the company was in charge...
{25792}{25861}...he used to|import many tools...
{25864}{25909}- Yes.|...sales were huge...
{25912}{25981}...but now his sons|are in charge...
{25984}{26029}The old man left business?
{26032}{26077}Yes, sort of, his sons are...
{26080}{26125}What are you|selling now?
{26128}{26221}Now his son import these|things, elastic bands...
{26224}{26317}...these little stars...|- New things.
{26320}{26389}- Yes. - Because nowadays|everything is visual.
{26392}{26461}- Made in China.|- I'll tell you something.
{26464}{26509}All this stuff...
{26512}{26581}Tell you something, Garcia,|let me tell you...
{26584}{26677}...nowadays people who can't|improvise, disappear.
{26680}{26725}What's your situation?
{26728}{26797}Now I don't work on|comission any more...
{26800}{26869}...they don't pay|for my expenses...
{26872}{26967}...they just pay for the|gas, what can I do with that?
{27040}{27085}That's all I got.
{27088}{27157}That's what they|did to me 5 years ago.
{27160}{27205}But they did me a favor.
{27208}{27303}Although they didn't think so.|I'll show you something.
{27328}{27397}This book, Garcia, this|book changed my life.
{27400}{27493}Because nowaydays|selling is a science.
{27496}{27589}I've underlined a wonderful|phrase here, listen to this...
{27592}{27685}...listen carefully, "Never|think of failure as failure...
{27688}{27781}...think of it as an opportunity|to change your course."
{27784}{27853}- What do you think?|- It's okay, fine.
{27856}{27925}"Think of failure as an|opportunity to apply...
{27928}{27973}...my techniques".|Do you follow?
{27976}{28045}- Very good. - This|is wonferful. - It is.
{28048}{28141}"Remember Edison, who had to|face more than a thousand...
{28144}{28213}..."no", before his light|bulb was accepted."
{28216}{28285}- We're talking about Edison!|- He was an inventor.
{28288}{28333}We can't get depressed.
{28336}{28381}Listen, listen, there's more.
{28384}{28429}This book changed my life.
{28432}{28477}Listen, listen to this.
{28480}{28551}"Learn the grammar|of the human body...
{28576}{28645}...if the prospect buyer|who's before you...
{28648}{28741}...leans forward it|means he's interested."
{28744}{28789}Lean forward.|Lean forward.
{28792}{28837}- Yes, yes...|- See?
{28840}{28909}- This shows interest.|- It's a good thing.
{28912}{28981}- "If he leans backwards...|- You won't sell anything.
{28984}{29031}...you're losing him".
{29056}{29101}Buying and selling.
{29104}{29173}Buying and selling,|but with the body.
{29176}{29221}- See?|- Clearly, clearly.
{29224}{29293}This is it, the|world has changed.
{29296}{29365}I we don't move forward,|we move backwards.
{29368}{29437}If we don't update our|methods we are lost.
{29440}{29509}Yeah, right. Hey, Fatty,|Fatty, come here.
{29512}{29557}- Come here, please.|- OK.
{29560}{29607}You're a few|Ibs. Overweight.
{29632}{29701}- Are you or not? - When|you start asking questions...
{29704}{29773}No, listen, what if I told|you can lose those pounds...
{29776}{29845}...in a week? - You|want to sell something.
{29848}{29893}You needn't|suffer, go on diet...
{29896}{29965}...what would you say?|- You want to sell something.
{29968}{30037}Listen, would you like to|lose 13 pounds in a week?
{30040}{30085}- Fuck off.|- Would you?
{30088}{30159}- Nothing. - Fatty, I|have something for you.
{30208}{30301}- It's on TV. - This time you|won't sell anything to me.
{30304}{30373}Look. The add's on TV, they're|plasters to lose weight...
{30376}{30445}..."Fat away". - No.|- The add is on TV.
{30448}{30517}- Don't you watch TV?|- Very little.
{30520}{30613}With these plasters you|can lose 10 pounds in a week.
{30616}{30661}Didn't you say 4?
{30664}{30735}13, 10 pounds, 5, what's|the difference?
{30760}{30805}Why don't you trust me?
{30808}{30879}This was made in Sweeden,|top quality.
{30904}{30973}Listen, today's the most|important day in my life...
{30976}{31071}...I can't sell you this, you're|not the right person for this.
{31216}{31311}Ready. Now I just have to wait,|in 10 minutes he'll be ready.
{31336}{31383}BAKERY
{31696}{31719}Good morning.
{31768}{31813}Hello. I'll go|fetch your cake.
{31816}{31885}- Today'll be a wonderful|day. - I hope so.
{31888}{31981}- Your husband? - He's|asleep, he's very tired...
{31984}{32053}...he worked all night|in your cake, poor soul.
{32056}{32125}- He's a real pro.|- He travels a lot.
{32128}{32223}He's always studying, now he's|taking a course in the internet.
{32272}{32295}Here it is.
{32320}{32367}What do you think?
{32440}{32463}It's really...
{32488}{32535}...a work of art, really.
{32560}{32653}I didn't expect it to be|so nice, it's wonderful.
{32656}{32701}I'm glad you like it.
{32704}{32775}I'd really like to congratulate|your husband myself.
{32800}{32847}He didn't write "Rene".
{32896}{32943}He didn't write "Rene".
{32992}{33037}You see, I asked|your husband...
{33040}{33109}...to write here "Happy|birthday, Rene"...
{33112}{33181}...do you understand?|But he only wrote...
{33184}{33229}..."Happy birthday".
{33232}{33303}Couldn't you...|add "Rene" there?
{33328}{33445}Me? If I touched of my|husband's cakes he'd kill me.
{33448}{33493}I can wake him up,|if you want.
{33496}{33589}No, no, it's okay,|we can't wake up the cook...
{33592}{33637}...for such a stupid thing.
{33640}{33733}- No, it's great, it's great.|- Okay. - It's great.
{33736}{33783}Do you want some candles?
{33808}{33879}- Yes, please. - How many?|- I don't know, really.
{33904}{33973}Don't you know how old|he's going to be?
{33976}{34045}He's a small boy, I|think 9 will be okay.
{34048}{34117}I was sure he was your boy.
{34120}{34165}No, he's a widow's son.
{34168}{34285}I know her because I used to|sell woods to her husband...
{34288}{34405}...poor guy... not long ago|he was run over by car.
{34408}{34477}She owns a notions store in|San Julian, it's on the...
{34480}{34549}...main street.|Do you know it? - No.
{34552}{34621}- I haven't been to San|Julian lately. - I see.
{34624}{34669}- It's a long trip.|- It is.
{34672}{34765}Don't leave it in the sun,|it'd spoil the cream.
{34768}{34813}I'm glad you told me.
{34816}{34861}Is the widow young?
{34864}{34911}Yes, she is. Poor woman.
{34936}{35005}I didn't stop visiting her|because she's alone.
{35008}{35077}So she told me it|was he son's birthday.
{35080}{35103}How nice.
{35128}{35197}I think it'll be|a nice surprise.
{35200}{35293}- Of course it will. - She doesn't|know I'm taking the cake.
{35296}{35343}It'll be very nice.
{35392}{35463}These are the best.|Thay are new.
{35488}{35533}After you blow them they...
{35536}{35583}...light again|by themselves.
{35680}{35725}I think this one|doesn't work.
{35728}{35797}Yes, it works, but|they are for kids...
{35800}{35871}...they don't blow|as hard as adults.
{36544}{36567}Hi.
{36592}{36663}- Good morning.|- Is everything okay? - Yes.
{36712}{36759}Where are you going?
{36808}{36831}San Julian.
{36856}{36927}San Julian is over|170 miles from here.
{36952}{37021}I know, lady. I live around|here. You may go now.
{37024}{37069}Have a nice trip.
{37072}{37117}Don't you want a ride?
{37120}{37191}I'm waiting for a friend,|he's a truck driver.
{37216}{37285}Is he going to|pick you up here?
{37288}{37335}Everyday at 3 he's here.
{37384}{37431}Come on, man,|I'll drive you.
{37576}{37623}Get in, come on.
{37816}{37887}- Do you like music?|- So so.
{37936}{37983}Give me a CD,|they're in there.
{38104}{38127}Here.
{38176}{38247}- What kind of music do|you like? - Any kind.
{38272}{38295}Let's see.
{39088}{39157}Were you planning to|walk to San Julian?
{39160}{39229}Look, lady, I've lived|here for 50 years.
{39232}{39301}I know every truck driver|in this highway, I'm sure...
{39304}{39351}...one of them|would drive me.
{39376}{39423}So you were|hitch-hiking.
{40120}{40165}I buy you breakfast.
{40168}{40215}No, thanks, lady.
{40240}{40287}- Are you sure?|- I am.
{40312}{40405}Okay. Give me the thermos, I'll|get water for your "mate".
{40408}{40455}Okay. That's fine.
{40528}{40575}I like that.|You're very kind.
{40744}{40839}- Shall I fill it up? - Yes, check|the water and oil too. - OK.
{41056}{41125}- Do you know how to|open the hood? - No.
{41128}{41151}Here it is.
{41368}{41391}How are you?
{41488}{41583}- Fine, and you?|- Just fine. How's the store?
{41608}{41679}- Fine, thanks.|- Where are you going?
{41704}{41775}To San Julian,|to pay the taxes.
{42280}{42351}- Did you see the guy who|was here? - There he is.
{42496}{42543}Trying to avoid me?
{42568}{42639}- I brought you hot water.|- Thanks a lot.
{42712}{42735}I'm Julia.
{42784}{42877}Beneditti, Justo Beneditti,|pleased to meet you.
{42880}{42951}- The same. Want a cookie?|- No, thanks.
{43024}{43069}What are you doing here?
{43072}{43117}I work for the government.
{43120}{43165}For the government?
{43168}{43263}They hired me to pick up|people walking by the road.
{43312}{43431}Don't laugh, it's a community|job, and you refused to get in.
{43480}{43549}- Why are you going to|San Julian? - No reason.
{43552}{43621}But are you going|to visit someone?
{43624}{43669}Just killing time.
{43672}{43743}- Have you killed a lot?|- Quite a lot.
{43768}{43839}Now seriously, I went|on this trip to think.
{43864}{43935}- I'm a biologist.|- A biologist?
{43960}{44055}Yes, I study molecular biology|and I live in Argentina.
{44080}{44127}Two things that|don't match.
{44344}{44391}Shall we go on?
{44440}{44485}What do biologists do?
{44488}{44535}They study life.
{44560}{44583}Life?
{44728}{44775}People's life?
{44800}{44847}People, animals, plants...
{44896}{44943}Animals, for example, dogs...
{44968}{45015}...can they understand?
{45040}{45085}If dogs can understand?
{45088}{45157}What do you mean?|Understand what?
{45160}{45229}- Things.|- I don't get it.
{45232}{45279}If they understand things.
{45304}{45349}I don't get|the question.
{45352}{45447}Does a dog understand if|something is right or wrong?
{45472}{45567}Yes, animals can understand|clearly what's right or wrong.
{45616}{45711}You mean a dog understands|if something is wrong?
{45736}{45783}Yes, I think so, but...
{45808}{45855}...that's not my|special field.
{45928}{45975}You often go|to San Julian?
{46000}{46045}I never go there.
{46048}{46143}But Gonzalez told me he saw|Uglyface, my dog, in San Julian.
{46168}{46215}When did he get lost?
{46264}{46311}He didn't get lost.
{46432}{46455}He left.
{46768}{46791}Are you OK?
{46840}{46863}I'm okay.
{47152}{47175}What's|wrong?
{47200}{47223}Nothing.
{47248}{47293}I think you|need fresh air.
{47296}{47365}We're near Tres Cerros,|we'll stop and see if...
{47368}{47413}...they have a|doctor there.
{47416}{47463}I'm feeling better.
{48208}{48253}Let's go see the doctor.
{48256}{48301}I'm all right,|believe me.
{48304}{48397}- Never mind, he'll have a look|at you. - It's not necessary.
{48400}{48469}Come on, grandpha.|Do it for me.
{48472}{48519}Zip you jacket,|it's very cold.
{48904}{48951}- Good morning.|- Morning.
{49072}{49117}Yes, what is it?
{49120}{49165}This man is not|feeling well...
{49168}{49213}...he's a bit pale,|I think.
{49216}{49311}I think it's his blood|pressure, he's so pale.
{49336}{49407}Sit down, I'll|fetch the doctor.
{49552}{49597}{y:i}... it's an incredible machine...
{49600}{49669}{y:i}... that will help|{y:i}you lose weight...
{49672}{49717}{y:i}... inches, fat, and mainly...
{49720}{49837}{y:i}... you'll be doing the most|{y:i}effective aerobic excercise.
{49840}{49885}{y:i}How do you|{y:i}feel it, Kimmy?
{49888}{49957}{y:i}I'm having fun,|{y:i}I don't want to stop.
{49960}{50055}{y:i}I can feel how my muscles|{y:i}are working, it really is...
{50152}{50221}Your blood pressure is|very low, you must stay...
{50224}{50293}...here for a while.|Norma? - I can't stay.
{50296}{50365}- I must go. - No, you can't.|- Yes, doctor?
{50368}{50463}Bring him a glass of salty|water and fill in the card.
{50488}{50557}I'd be very irresponsible...
{50560}{50605}...if I let you go like this.
{50608}{50655}- I have to go.|- You can't go.
{50680}{50749}You stay here for a while|calm down and when...
{50752}{50799}...you feel better|you may go.
{50872}{50917}Well, I must... leave...
{50920}{50967}...I must go on|the road again.
{50992}{51015}I can't stay.
{51088}{51111}Good luck.
{51232}{51255}Take care.
{51400}{51447}What's your name?
{51472}{51543}- John.|- What else?
{51568}{51613}- Dough.|- Dough.
{51616}{51661}Where are you from?
{51664}{51733}- Aguada Cecilio.|- Aguada Cecilio?
{51736}{51783}That's right.
{51808}{51879}- See who's arrived.|- Okay.
{52288}{52357}- Here.|- Who was it, Norma?
{52360}{52431}- The guy who comes for|treatment. - Let him in.
{52456}{52479}Come in.
{52528}{52621}- Hello! - How are you?|How's your ankle?
{52624}{52717}Better, better, it hurts|a little when I walk but...
{52720}{52765}...it's better, a lot better.
{52768}{52815}- I'll have a look|at it. - OK.
{52864}{52933}How are you?|Why are you here?
{52936}{52981}- What's wrong?|- You know him?
{52984}{53053}Of course, I've known him|for 20 years, he owns...
{53056}{53101}...Fitz Roy general store.
{53104}{53149}Remember me? I'm Roberto.
{53152}{53199}You're wrong about me.
{53224}{53271}I'm from Aguada Cecilio.
{53320}{53367}You move your|ears, don't you?
{53392}{53439}I don't move anything.
{53560}{53605}Let me see your ankle.
{53608}{53701}- I think she's ready, contractions|take longer. - OK, I'm coming.
{53704}{53773}Could you put this cake|in the fridge, please?
{53776}{53823}Norma, put it|in the fridge.
{53848}{53895}Thanks. Be careful, please.
{53920}{54037}- Where can I have a cake|decorated? - Decorated? - Yes.
{54040}{54133}I had the cake made but they|didn't write the kid's name so...
{54136}{54205}Here bakeries are|no good, I tell you.
{54208}{54301}It seems I bought any cake,|but I had the cake made...
{54304}{54351}...specially for this kid.
{54424}{54493}{y:i}- First aid ward?|- Yes, come in.
{54496}{54565}{y:i}A man came here|{y:i}looking for his father...
{54568}{54637}{y:i}... an elderly man who|{y:i}got lost in this area.
{54640}{54709}- Where is the man from?|{y:i}- He's from Fitz Roy.
{54712}{54805}There's an old man here,|but he's not from Fitz Roy.
{54808}{54903}{y:i}He said the old man might|{y:i}be going to San Julian...
{55024}{55095}Your son is coming,|you must wait for him.
{55336}{55383}- See you.|- See you, man.
{56032}{56077}How much are these ones?
{56080}{56127}- 3 for $1.|- Give me 3.
{56224}{56271}- Thank you.|- You're welcome.
{56536}{56581}Is that a red van?
{56584}{56631}No, it's a car.
{56992}{57015}Fill it.
{57448}{57493}- Good morning.|- Good morning.
{57496}{57543}What are you up to?
{57592}{57637}Would you like a "mate"?
{57640}{57663}Thanks.
{57712}{57759}Your ankle is|better, isn't it?
{57784}{57831}Where are you going?
{57880}{57903}San Julian.
{57952}{57975}Want a ride?
{58000}{58047}I'd be grateful, Roberto.
{58072}{58119}Now you remember me.
{58144}{58191}My memory never fails me.
{58216}{58287}- Don't go, I'll be right back.|- Okay. - Use hot water.
{58408}{58455}Hello? How are you?
{58480}{58525}You recognized me.
{58528}{58573}No, no, I'm in...
{58576}{58623}...in Catamarca.
{58648}{58741}No, I don't think I'll go|there until next month.
{58744}{58791}Yes. But you never know.
{58816}{58861}No, I just called to...
{58864}{58887}...to say...
{58912}{58981}...to say happy|birthday to Rene.
{58984}{59031}Yes. What?
{59056}{59079}You told me.
{59104}{59199}Okay. Because I never|forget those things.
{59248}{59293}Okay. Okay, the|same to you.
{59296}{59343}I send you my regards.
{59368}{59413}And a kiss for Rene.
{59416}{59463}Another one for you.
{59488}{59535}Okay, see you, see you.
{59776}{59845}- Are you in a hurry?|- No, I'm not.
{59848}{59917}I'll be back in 10 minutes,|I just want to see...
{59920}{59989}...if they can correct|something here.
{59992}{60039}- Okay, I'll wait.|- Okay.
{60160}{60229}Listen, if you see my son|don't tell him I'm here.
{60232}{60301}- I won't, don't worry.|- He drives a red van.
{60304}{60327}Don't worry.
{60688}{60733}Take one if you want.
{60736}{60807}- May I? - Yes, of course.|- They look nice.
{60880}{60927}You've got many trophees.
{60976}{61045}My husband is a|wrestling instructor.
{61048}{61095}- You don't say.|- He is.
{61144}{61191}That's his weakness.
{61215}{61260}Okay, okay...
{61268}{61315}...let's see if you like it.
{61528}{61599}I think we have|a small problem.
{61648}{61671}What's|wrong?
{61720}{61743}They...
{61768}{61815}...they're different.
{61840}{61957}I mean, it's obvious the|kid's name was added later on.
{61960}{62029}The style of "Happy|birthday" is different from...
{62032}{62079}...the style|in "Rene".
{62128}{62151}It is.
{62200}{62247}It looks like a graft there.
{62272}{62319}My handwriting|is different.
{62464}{62509}Excuse me, what's|your name?
{62512}{62605}- People call me Vaucha.|- Vaucha, do you know...
{62608}{62653}...what Charles|Wilson said?
{62656}{62725}This man who became a|millionaire selling things...
{62728}{62821}...said that creativity,|the ability to improvise...
{62824}{62895}...and spontaniety|make the difference.
{62920}{62967}What I mean is this, lady...
{62992}{63085}...let's be creative and|find solution for this...
{63088}{63135}...I'm sure we can solve this.
{63232}{63277}Come on, Vaucha...
{63280}{63325}...I know you can do it.
{63328}{63421}- We can do something.|- What can we do? Tell me.
{63424}{63517}We could take off the first|letter in "birthday"...
{63520}{63613}...and then I could write|it with my handwriting.
{63616}{63685}I can write it again.|I think it'll be okay.
{63688}{63757}- Perfect. - What do|you think? - Perfect.
{63760}{63805}That's the solution.
{63808}{63877}How long will you|take to do it?
{63880}{63949}- 10 or 15 minutes.|- Okay, I'll wait for you.
{63952}{64021}{y:i}- Today you didn't call me.|{y:i}- I didn't.
{64024}{64117}{y:i}- I went shopping.|{y:i}- When? - In the morning.
{64120}{64213}{y:i}How do you know I called|{y:i}if the phone didn't ring?
{64216}{64285}{y:i}- I just know. - It didn't|{y:i}ring in the morning.
{64288}{64359}{y:i}- Just once.|{y:i}- Who was it? - Fonseca.
{64384}{64453}{y:i}Fonseca? What|{y:i}did Fonseca want?
{64456}{64501}{y:i}He knew you're|{y:i}coming today.
{64504}{64573}{y:i}- You love Fonseca!|{y:i}- No, Alberto! - Lier!
{64576}{64621}{y:i}- Let me go!|{y:i}- Bitch!
{64624}{64717}{y:i}You're crazy, you're out|{y:i}of your mind, Alberto!
{64720}{64767}{y:i}I'm sorry. Forgive me.
{64864}{64935}Jealousy is a|horrible illness.
{64960}{64983}Horrible.
{65032}{65101}It destroys everything,|it destroys people...
{65104}{65151}...feelings, everything.
{65224}{65271}I'm telling you because...
{65296}{65343}...I know about that.
{65392}{65463}Because of that illness|I lost my wife.
{65560}{65583}Poor Ana.
{65608}{65655}At first|she was happy.
{65728}{65821}The thing is I used to travel|a lot, I've always traveled.
{65824}{65893}When I got home I wanted to|know where she had been...
{65896}{65943}...what she had|done, everything.
{65992}{66037}- I tired her.|- Like on TV.
{66040}{66111}- What? - Like on TV.|- Yes.
{66136}{66181}Can I have another one?
{66184}{66231}Yes, please, have|all you want.
{66256}{66303}A jealous salesman.
{66328}{66375}Oil and water, right?
{66400}{66493}As time goes by you see|things in a different way.
{66496}{66543}Live and learn.
{66568}{66615}How old will Rene be?
{66640}{66685}Frankly, I don't know him.
{66688}{66757}I don't know, but|he's a small boy.
{66760}{66829}He's a client's son,|but I've never met him.
{66832}{66925}My niece's name is Rene too,|but she's 15 already.
{66928}{66999}Okay, okay. Let's see|if you like it now.
{67024}{67069}It's great, yes, excellent.
{67072}{67165}Give me the check, and I'll|take some cookies too.
{67168}{67237}Don't you have|a nicer wraping?
{67240}{67285}Don't you want a box?
{67288}{67407}- That'd better. - Yes, I'll|tie a ribbon, it'll be very nice.
{67624}{67693}- May I ask you a question?|- Yes, of course.
{67696}{67791}For you, Rene is a boy or a|girl? What do you think?
{67816}{67911}I had a great-aunt|whose name was Rene.
{67936}{68005}She wieghed 280 pounds.
{68008}{68077}When she died they made|a special box for her.
{68080}{68149}If somebody,|anybody says Rene...
{68152}{68269}...what's the first thing|that comes into your head?
{68272}{68319}A boy, a girl, what?
{68344}{68463}I knew a football player, Rene|Pontoni, an excelent player.
{68488}{68535}He scored a great goal.
{68560}{68631}He headed the ball downwards,|it was a tricky play.
{68656}{68701}The goal keeper|run to catch...
{68704}{68773}...the ball, it bounced and|jumped over his head...
{68776}{68823}...and went into the goal.
{68848}{68893}Rene Pontoni.
{68896}{68967}I'm so stupid.|I'm really stupid.
{69040}{69087}What if Rene is a girl?
{69184}{69231}The cake is a ball.
{69256}{69325}What if I get there,|ring the bell and...
{69328}{69375}...Rene is a|girl with curls?
{69424}{69469}What will I do|with the cake?
{69472}{69519}Maybe she|likes football.
{69664}{69733}Now I remember she told me...|no, I asked her...
{69736}{69781}..."who takes care of Rene?"
{69784}{69879}And she said: "He's|with his granny now."
{69952}{69997}"He's with his granny"?
{70000}{70071}Or did she say: "She's|with her granny"?
{70120}{70191}"He's with his..."|"She's with her..."
{70720}{70767}Do me a favor, Mr. Justo...
{70792}{70861}...do me favor, see|the box in the back?
{70864}{70911}- Yes. - Take que lid off.
{71080}{71175}I've got it. Nowadays only|those can improvise survive.
{71200}{71247}Tell me what you think.
{71272}{71319}See the cake is ball?
{71344}{71389}We change its color...
{71392}{71485}...we add a little head|and 4 little legs.
{71488}{71535}...what do we get?
{71632}{71655}What?
{71752}{71821}A turtle! Don't you|see it's a turtle?
{71824}{71869}A head, four legs,|that's it.
{71872}{71967}It's okay either for|a boy or for a girl.
{72280}{72349}- Good morning, officer.|- Good morning, sir.
{72352}{72445}I'm looking for a bakery|here in town, do you know...?
{72448}{72493}No, there are|no bakeries here...
{72496}{72543}...bread comes from Deseado.
{72568}{72661}I need to have a cake|decorated, it's here...

{85288}{85359}Let's see, tell me the|whole story, come on.
{85576}{85599}Come on, man.
{85744}{85791}About 3 years ago...
{85816}{85863}...a new sheriff came...
{85888}{85959}...to Fitz Roy,|Chief Cifuentes.
{86056}{86125}He had nothing better|to do in Fitz Roy...
{86128}{86221}...so he decided to call all|the people who drove cars...
{86224}{86295}...and ask them for|their driving license.
{86416}{86487}So I had to go|to Deseado...
{86512}{86605}...to get it. It was a long trip,|so I took Uglyface with me...
{86608}{86655}...to keep me company.
{86680}{86775}When I got there, I had|to read... small letters.
{86824}{86871}I could hardly see them.
{86968}{87013}When I was going back...
{87016}{87061}...the sun was on my face...
{87064}{87111}...I couldn't see anything...
{87136}{87183}...it blinded me.
{87232}{87303}Suddenly I run a guy over.
{87472}{87519}Didn't see him.
{87568}{87615}Sometimes it's fate.
{87688}{87735}I couldn't think clearly.
{87760}{87805}So I left him there...
{87808}{87855}...on the road.
{87952}{87997}That was when Uglyface...
{88000}{88047}...got mad at me.
{88096}{88143}He howled all night long.
{88168}{88215}In the morning he was gone.
{88424}{88493}- Don't you want|to lie down? - No.
{88496}{88589}- Have you got a place to|stay? - No, but don't worry.
{88592}{88661}There's a shack here,|sometimes I sleep there.
{88664}{88709}Go to bed now...|Bye, Ismael...
{88712}{88783}...tomorrow morning|we'll go see Losa.
{88808}{88903}- I'll call you... bye...|when it's ready. - Thanks, Fermin.
{89168}{89215}See you tomorrow.
{89408}{89479}The dog left because|of what I did.
{89528}{89573}I saw the way|he looked at me.
{89576}{89623}Impossible,|he's just a dog.
{89648}{89719}He's the only one|who knows who I am.
{89768}{89837}Go to sleep now, tomorrow|morning we'll go see Losa.
{89840}{89909}Maybe the dog|will forgive you.
{89912}{89983}I'll turn the TV on,|so you don't get bored.
{90080}{90127}- See you tomorrow.|- See you.
{90560}{90677}{y:i}Now we're going to play with|"the" 3 "finalists of the month..."
