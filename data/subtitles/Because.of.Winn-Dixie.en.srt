00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:11,092
Safe!

3
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:17,220
<i>In the beginning, when we moved</i>
<i>to Naomi, it was just the preacher and me.</i>

4
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:21,558
<i>Only sometimes- most of the time, really-</i>

5
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,724
<i>it seemed like it was me alone.</i>

6
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:26,902
<i>And then one morning</i>
<i>the preacher sent me to the store</i>

7
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:31,779
<i>for a box of macaroni and cheese,</i>
<i>some white rice and two tomatoes.</i>

8
00:01:31,867 --> 00:01:35,153
<i>And after that, everything changed.</i>

9
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:40,666
<i>But I'm getting ahead of myself.</i>
<i>It's a good story. Let me tell it right.</i>

10
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:14,905
I appreciate you coming, I really do.
Thank you very much. Have a seat in there.

11
00:02:14,993 --> 00:02:17,864
- Oh, is that for me, I hope?
- Yes, it sure is.

12
00:02:51,697 --> 00:02:54,402
I feel blessed to be brought here to Naomi,

13
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:57,196
to do God's work in his new church.

14
00:02:57,286 --> 00:03:03,620
I'll admit, I'm still getting used to the idea
of his house being in a convenience store.

15
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:11,377
Nothing wrong with making church
more convenient.

16
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:42,154
I have preached in some
pretty strange places in my time...

17
00:03:42,247 --> 00:03:45,367
Not that this is a strange place.
I didn't mean that.

18
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,080
Ah.

19
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:51,038
Opal.

20
00:03:52,007 --> 00:03:54,794
Come on in. Sit down.

21
00:03:54,885 --> 00:03:56,961
Please.

22
00:03:58,097 --> 00:03:59,970
Glad you finally made it.

23
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:06,888
This is my daughter, India Opal.

24
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:11,146
Forgive us, we're new here.
Still trying to find our way around.

25
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:17,238
Maybe one of you two boys
could teach Opal a better short cut to church.

26
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:19,364
No?

27
00:04:22,413 --> 00:04:24,619
Let us pray.

28
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,242
Our Father, who art in heaven...

29
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:33,542
<i>It's me, God. If it's not too much trouble,</i>
<i>I'd like some friends.</i>

30
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:37,760
<i>I don't know that many kids,</i>
<i>only the ones from church.</i>

31
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,921
<i>And there aren't that many here.</i>

32
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,757
<i>There's Amanda Wilkinson,</i>

33
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:47,389
<i>whose face is always pinched up</i>
<i>like she's smelling something real bad.</i>

34
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:50,765
<i>And Sweetie Pie Thomas,</i>
<i>who's only five years old,</i>

35
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:54,690
<i>still mostly a baby,</i>
<i>and is always sucking on her knuckle.</i>

36
00:04:55,237 --> 00:05:00,860
<i>There's Dunlap and Stevie Dewberry. I know</i>
<i>they can't help it that they're bald, God.</i>

37
00:05:00,951 --> 00:05:06,989
<i>Their mama shaved their heads on account</i>
<i>of Dunlap got fleas in his hair from their cat.</i>

38
00:05:07,082 --> 00:05:11,625
<i>But even the bald Dewberry boys</i>
<i>don't want to be my friend anyway.</i>

39
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:15,792
<i>One more thing, God. I miss my mama.</i>

40
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:20,841
<i>Please, God, I'd really like</i>
<i>to see my mama again.</i>

41
00:05:22,473 --> 00:05:25,390
- Amen.
- Amen.

42
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:42,032
<i>Opal? Come on. No TV</i>
<i>until you put some of that stuff away.</i>

43
00:05:57,216 --> 00:05:59,623
I bet they already have a new pitcher.

44
00:05:59,718 --> 00:06:02,256
We're not moving back to Watley.

45
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:06,972
I know it's hard moving all the time,
but that's part of my job.

46
00:06:16,151 --> 00:06:19,603
Up and at 'em, Daddy! I made orange juice.

47
00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:29,495
Daddy! I made orange juice.

48
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:38,247
Daddy!

49
00:07:35,397 --> 00:07:37,935
There he goes! That way!

50
00:07:40,235 --> 00:07:44,944
- Get over here!
- I'll get him. Coming through!

51
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:48,116
<i>Boyd? Boyd Lee.</i>

52
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:52,864
<i>Could you please</i>
<i>approach the produce section.</i>

53
00:07:59,922 --> 00:08:01,998
What in the Sam Hill is going on?

54
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:05,045
<i>Please report to the produce section, Boyd.</i>

55
00:08:05,135 --> 00:08:07,211
I'm in the produce section.

56
00:08:07,304 --> 00:08:10,755
- What? What is it?
<i>- It's a dog, Boyd.</i>

57
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:15,178
We can't have no dogs in the Winn-Dixie.

58
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:20,351
Well, don't let him get by the eggs!

59
00:08:22,111 --> 00:08:24,518
Look! There he goes! Stop him!

60
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:28,825
Hey! He's going around. Go get him!

61
00:08:32,704 --> 00:08:35,705
Tracy, go round that... Get the dog!

62
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,039
Cut him off.

63
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,926
Will somebody grab that dog, please!

64
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:54,134
Somebody grab that dog!

65
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:56,682
Somebody grab that dog! Oof.

66
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:04,652
Get him off of me. I don't like dogs.
Somebody get him off of me.

67
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:11,358
It's OK, sir. All that dog wants to do
is get face to face with you

68
00:09:11,452 --> 00:09:15,366
and thank you for the good time he's having.

69
00:09:15,456 --> 00:09:18,373
Call the pound. Mike, go call the pound.

70
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:21,958
Wait! Don't call the pound. That's <i>my</i> dog!

71
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,796
<i>And then I knew I had done something big.</i>

72
00:09:30,888 --> 00:09:33,842
<i>Maybe stupid too.</i>

73
00:09:33,932 --> 00:09:38,594
<i>But I couldn't help it. I couldn't let them</i>
<i>take that dog to the pound.</i>

74
00:09:38,687 --> 00:09:41,308
Here, boy.

75
00:09:41,857 --> 00:09:44,941
Come on, boy.

76
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:51,527
Here, Winn-Dixie.

77
00:09:58,457 --> 00:10:00,615
Who names their dog Winn-Dixie?

78
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:03,117
Me. It's his name, honest.

79
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:07,374
Don't you know better
than to bring a dog in a grocery store?

80
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:11,131
Sorry, sir. It won't happen again. I promise.

81
00:10:14,223 --> 00:10:16,299
Come on, Winn-Dixie.

82
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:27,980
Well, what are all y'all looking at?

83
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:31,653
That dog almost ate my face off.

84
00:10:47,506 --> 00:10:49,380
Sit.

85
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:53,800
Stay here. I'll be right back.

86
00:11:09,486 --> 00:11:14,065
<i>Sometimes the preacher looked</i>
<i>just like a turtle hiding inside its shell,</i>

87
00:11:14,158 --> 00:11:20,492
<i>in there thinking about things and</i>
<i>not ever sticking his head out into the world.</i>

88
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:22,075
Daddy?

89
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:25,499
Yes? What is it? What is it, Opal?

90
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:28,587
I found a dog and I want to keep him.

91
00:11:28,672 --> 00:11:33,749
A dog? Now, we have been through this
before. You do not need a dog.

92
00:11:33,844 --> 00:11:37,924
I know it. I know I don't need a dog.
But this dog needs <i>me.</i>

93
00:11:38,015 --> 00:11:40,470
- He doesn't neither need you.
- Does too.

94
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,394
- For goodness' sake.
- He does. Winn-Dixie!

95
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:47,887
- Here, boy!
- The last thing in the world we need is...

96
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,648
- This isn't a dog, it's a horse.
- And he's homeless too.

97
00:11:55,741 --> 00:11:59,240
- He's got a stink to him too.
- I know it.

98
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:05,206
Well, he needs all the help he can get, right?

99
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:08,661
- I could be doing my duty.
- Yeah, well...

100
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,807
Look. He's smiling at you.

101
00:12:27,898 --> 00:12:31,599
Don't you love a dog with a sense of humor?

102
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:43,243
Would you run and get the tweezers?
I think he's got something stuck in his paw.

103
00:12:52,464 --> 00:12:55,169
He's a nice dog, isn't he?

104
00:12:57,052 --> 00:13:00,136
He's a great dog, isn't he?

105
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,065
- You can't keep this dog, Opal.
- Please, Daddy!

106
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,483
Look at him. He's skinny.
He needs to be fed, bathed too.

107
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,776
- No. No. No!
- Please!

108
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:19,699
No! I said no.

109
00:13:19,783 --> 00:13:22,570
Please.

110
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:35,579
- He can stay while you find him a home...
- He can stay?

111
00:13:35,674 --> 00:13:37,999
- Temporarily.
- Yes!

112
00:13:38,093 --> 00:13:40,252
You're not keeping him, Opal.

113
00:13:40,345 --> 00:13:43,465
This is temporary
so don't go getting your hopes up.

114
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:46,511
We're not getting our hopes up,
are we, Winn-Dixie?

115
00:13:46,602 --> 00:13:48,725
Good. Why don't you make some signs

116
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:51,766
so folks'll know you found a dog
who needs a home?

117
00:13:51,857 --> 00:13:54,811
- Come on, Winn-Dixie.
- And a bath, and a shower.

118
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:37,192
Hey, come back here, Winn-Dixie.

119
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:48,571
Little miss, you think
you're using up enough water?

120
00:14:48,664 --> 00:14:52,614
- Uh... We still gotta rinse.
- Where'd you get that hose?

121
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:55,165
I didn't think you'd mind if I borrowed it.

122
00:14:55,254 --> 00:14:58,208
Well, I do mind.

123
00:15:01,427 --> 00:15:04,344
I'm sorry, Mr. Alfred. I'm sorry.

124
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:08,427
Come back here, you stupid dog, you.

125
00:15:09,184 --> 00:15:11,722
If I catch you, so help me, you... Oh!

126
00:15:17,735 --> 00:15:23,274
I made an exception for the kid,
but there is no exception for that mongrel.

127
00:15:23,365 --> 00:15:27,944
You see that sign on the front of my trailer?
Does anybody read my signs?

128
00:15:28,036 --> 00:15:30,788
We're not keeping him.
We're finding him a home.

129
00:15:30,873 --> 00:15:33,624
Well, hurry it up or I'm calling the pound.

130
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:50,765
- Daddy?
- Dry that dog off, Opal.

131
00:15:52,144 --> 00:15:55,180
And dry yourself off too.

132
00:16:00,652 --> 00:16:04,864
You know, Winn-Dixie, if my mama
were around, I bet she'd let me keep you.

133
00:16:04,948 --> 00:16:08,364
Since we moved here
I've thought about my mama extra hard.

134
00:16:08,452 --> 00:16:11,785
- Opal? I hope that dog's not in your bed.
- Yes, sir.

135
00:16:11,872 --> 00:16:14,707
I mean... no, sir, he's not.

136
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:21,954
I really don't know where she is.
She left when I was only three years old.

137
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:24,207
I can't hardly remember her.

138
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:29,467
Make sure you got your window shut.
Don't want that rain getting in.

139
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,845
OK.

140
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:40,101
The preacher? It's no use.
He won't talk to me at all about her.

141
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:43,193
I bet <i>you</i> don't remember
your mama much either.

142
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:46,114
So we're really alike, you and me.

143
00:16:47,157 --> 00:16:50,989
Think I should make
the preacher tell me about her?

144
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:54,494
- I'll think about it.
- You're supposed to be in bed.

145
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:58,667
Daddy, will you tell me about Mama?

146
00:16:59,545 --> 00:17:03,293
I know you don't like to talk about her.

147
00:17:03,382 --> 00:17:06,217
But I don't even remember
what she looked like.

148
00:17:06,301 --> 00:17:11,972
What did she look like?
I don't need to know a lot. Just a few things.

149
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:15,307
She'd tell you not to stay up so late.

150
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:25,061
Opal? Ready to head out
and put up those signs?

151
00:17:25,946 --> 00:17:28,651
Yes, sir. Hold on.

152
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,951
Leave him here.

153
00:17:43,046 --> 00:17:46,297
Stay here. Stay.

154
00:18:23,212 --> 00:18:25,288
What the?

155
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:37,340
God... bless it.

156
00:18:43,065 --> 00:18:45,770
Opal, would you bring
that dog inside, please?

157
00:18:49,238 --> 00:18:50,981
Come on, Winn-Dixie.

158
00:18:51,573 --> 00:18:55,653
<i>That night I wrote in my journal</i>
<i>that what the preacher couldn't see</i>

159
00:18:55,744 --> 00:19:01,414
<i>is that Winn-Dixie wasn't lost,</i>
<i>and I didn't find him, he found me.</i>

160
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,083
<i>He was a dog who knew how to be a friend.</i>

161
00:19:20,686 --> 00:19:23,259
Hey, boy. Where are we going?

162
00:19:29,528 --> 00:19:35,234
You like that? I bet with a collar like that
you'd feel like you belonged to somebody.

163
00:19:35,743 --> 00:19:38,447
Well, maybe we can afford it.

164
00:19:39,705 --> 00:19:41,863
Winn-Dixie.

165
00:19:46,879 --> 00:19:49,334
- Hello?
- Hello?

166
00:19:52,301 --> 00:19:54,792
- Hello?
- Hello.

167
00:20:12,237 --> 00:20:14,313
Hello.

168
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:17,820
Hello.

169
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:20,991
Hello?

170
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,452
I'm sorry. Do you work here?

171
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,616
Yeah, but we're closed.

172
00:20:27,795 --> 00:20:29,704
Oi. Hey.

173
00:20:29,797 --> 00:20:33,248
Don't mind him.
That's just how he says hello.

174
00:20:36,136 --> 00:20:40,845
- That's Winn-Dixie and I'm Opal.
- I'm Otis.

175
00:20:41,725 --> 00:20:45,390
Well, Otis, my dog sure likes this red collar,

176
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:48,848
but I don't get a big enough allowance
to afford it.

177
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:51,692
Look, I'm just here
to take care of the animals.

178
00:20:51,777 --> 00:20:54,813
Otis. Shut up!

179
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:58,404
I was thinking maybe we could
set up an installment plan.

180
00:20:58,492 --> 00:21:01,861
- I don't think I can do that.
- Well, I can work for you.

181
00:21:01,954 --> 00:21:06,497
I could sweep the floors and straighten up
the shelves and take out the trash.

182
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,833
- I could do that.
- Well, that's what <i>I</i> do.

183
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,206
Oh. Well, you sure need some help.

184
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:18,841
I'm real trustworthy.
The only thing is, Winn-Dixie, my dog,

185
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:21,218
he'd have to come with me while I work.

186
00:21:21,306 --> 00:21:26,467
- He doesn't like to be left alone.
- Well, Gertrude doesn't like dogs.

187
00:21:26,562 --> 00:21:29,479
She owns a pet shop
and she don't like dogs?

188
00:21:29,565 --> 00:21:32,435
Yeah. No, I mean <i>that</i> Gertrude, the parrot.

189
00:21:32,526 --> 00:21:34,353
Gertrude.

190
00:21:34,445 --> 00:21:38,277
It's named after the owner.
It doesn't like dogs.

191
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:41,283
She might like Winn-Dixie.
Almost everybody does.

192
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:44,951
If the two of them get along,
then could I have the job?

193
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,538
- I don't know.
- Dog. Dog. Dog!

194
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:52,872
- I know it's a dog.
- Gertrude's a pretty bird.

195
00:21:54,089 --> 00:21:55,963
Hello, dog.

196
00:21:56,049 --> 00:22:00,261
See? She likes him.
That's pretty amazing, don't you think?

197
00:22:00,345 --> 00:22:02,504
I'll be damned.

198
00:22:02,598 --> 00:22:05,089
We're all set then. Thanks.

199
00:22:05,184 --> 00:22:07,935
No, wait, miss. I can’t just give you a job...

200
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,519
Thank you! You won't be sorry.
I'm a real hard worker.

201
00:22:11,607 --> 00:22:15,936
That's nice. Thank you for listening.
Have a nice day, ma'am.

202
00:22:16,028 --> 00:22:18,649
A ten-year-old makes me look like an idiot.

203
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:20,281
Shut up. Idiot.

204
00:22:39,384 --> 00:22:41,461
Need some help?

205
00:22:42,262 --> 00:22:44,753
Get rid of that dog.

206
00:22:44,848 --> 00:22:47,256
Oh, Lord.

207
00:22:47,351 --> 00:22:51,514
- What did he... what did he do now?
- Nothing.

208
00:22:51,605 --> 00:22:55,685
He don't have to do nothing.
I make the rules here and it's "no pets".

209
00:22:55,776 --> 00:23:00,272
Opal's been very responsible with the dog.
She's still looking for a home.

210
00:23:00,364 --> 00:23:05,109
Get me a photo, I'll post it on eBay.
I'll get you competing bids within an hour.

211
00:23:05,202 --> 00:23:07,278
I don't think that's necessary.

212
00:23:07,371 --> 00:23:12,911
You stay here rent-free because I can write it
off as a charitable donation to the church.

213
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:15,872
But my charity stops with that animal.

214
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:20,957
You know how much we appreciate
the accommodation here, sir.

215
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:23,423
Call the pound.

216
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:29,091
Mr. Alfred, please. I'm sure we can work
something out. Give us a little more time.

217
00:23:29,184 --> 00:23:31,889
You want a home or a dog?

218
00:23:32,896 --> 00:23:35,387
Call the pound.

219
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,737
Well, I just figured you got
such a nice big place over there.

220
00:23:46,827 --> 00:23:49,994
And I'm sure he'd be fine
with your other dogs.

221
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,239
Uh-huh.

222
00:23:52,332 --> 00:23:55,168
Don't let him see you.

223
00:23:55,252 --> 00:23:58,039
He's very playful. He's great with kids.

224
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:02,792
Opal thinks the world of him.
Yeah, mm-hm.

225
00:24:02,885 --> 00:24:08,721
Well, listen, if you think of somebody,
you be sure to give me a call. All right?

226
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:12,935
- Come back here, Winn-Dixie.
- I hope to see you in church on Sunday.

227
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,012
All right. Bye, now.

228
00:24:27,242 --> 00:24:29,733
No!

229
00:24:30,204 --> 00:24:32,280
Winn-Dixie!

230
00:24:32,372 --> 00:24:36,073
Winn-Dixie! Winn-Dixie, no!

231
00:24:36,168 --> 00:24:39,667
- Opal. Opal. Come on. I know, I know.
- No!

232
00:24:39,755 --> 00:24:44,500
- I need you to sign this release form.
- It's not right, Daddy! You know it isn't!

233
00:24:45,511 --> 00:24:49,176
- Stop that right now.
- Please! He's the only friend I have!

234
00:24:49,264 --> 00:24:54,222
Don't take him away. Please!

235
00:24:54,311 --> 00:24:56,802
Please.

236
00:24:57,898 --> 00:25:00,187
Please.

237
00:25:02,111 --> 00:25:05,361
Wait. Don't take him.

238
00:25:06,532 --> 00:25:09,486
- What, this isn't the dog?
- There's been a mistake.

239
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:11,783
That isn't the dog.

240
00:25:33,725 --> 00:25:36,299
Come on, get him inside. Let's go.

241
00:25:39,898 --> 00:25:44,026
<i>The preacher took a loan out from the church</i>
<i>and paid off our rent.</i>

242
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:50,363
<i>But he had to promise Mr. Alfred he would find</i>
<i>Winn-Dixie a home before the end of summer.</i>

243
00:25:51,452 --> 00:25:54,156
<i>I would've promised anybody anything.</i>

244
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:57,289
<i>I was just so happy</i>
<i>to have Winn-Dixie with me.</i>

245
00:25:57,374 --> 00:26:00,660
<i>And I was happy</i>
<i>to have a job at Gertrude's Pets.</i>

246
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:17,602
This is our town. See?

247
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:22,015
Kinda lonely, isn't it?

248
00:26:25,486 --> 00:26:27,977
What?

249
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:35,825
Hey, Winn-Dixie!

250
00:26:35,913 --> 00:26:38,320
Wait! Wait for me, boy.

251
00:26:42,961 --> 00:26:44,669
Hey, Winn-Dixie.

252
00:26:52,387 --> 00:26:55,305
Winn-Dixie, come back here.

253
00:26:56,683 --> 00:26:58,759
That's the library.

254
00:26:58,852 --> 00:27:00,928
You can't go in there.

255
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:03,939
It says so on the sign.

256
00:27:15,452 --> 00:27:19,201
Wow. Look at all those books.

257
00:27:46,442 --> 00:27:48,648
Oh, my goodness.

258
00:27:52,865 --> 00:27:55,190
Are you all right?

259
00:27:55,284 --> 00:27:56,992
- It's a bear.
- A bear?

260
00:27:57,077 --> 00:27:58,737
- He's come back.
- He has?

261
00:27:58,829 --> 00:28:00,905
- Yes.
- Where is he?

262
00:28:00,998 --> 00:28:04,164
- He's right out there.
- That's no bear.

263
00:28:04,251 --> 00:28:07,667
That's just a dog. It's <i>my</i> dog- Winn-Dixie.

264
00:28:07,755 --> 00:28:10,709
A dog? Oh.

265
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,714
It's your dog? You sure?

266
00:28:14,803 --> 00:28:18,468
Yes, ma'am, I'm positive.
I'd know him anywhere.

267
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,933
Let me help you up. Come on.

268
00:28:25,105 --> 00:28:27,181
It's OK.

269
00:28:30,402 --> 00:28:35,148
- Who are you?
- I'm India Opal, but you can just call me Opal.

270
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:40,282
I'm Miss Franny. You must think I'm
a silly old thing, mistaking a dog for a bear.

271
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,577
Are you sure that is a dog?

272
00:28:42,664 --> 00:28:46,033
Yes, ma'am. I'm sure.

273
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:48,878
He just don't like to be left alone, is all.

274
00:28:48,962 --> 00:28:51,085
Mm-hm.

275
00:28:51,173 --> 00:28:53,249
Sorry to bother you, Miss Franny.

276
00:28:53,342 --> 00:28:56,592
Well, I had a bad experience with a bear

277
00:28:56,678 --> 00:28:59,466
coming into Herman W. Block
Memorial Library.

278
00:28:59,556 --> 00:29:03,175
- I've never quite gotten over it.
- A bear came into the library?

279
00:29:03,268 --> 00:29:06,554
Oh, yes. It's quite a story.

280
00:29:06,647 --> 00:29:09,767
I sure would like to hear it.

281
00:29:09,858 --> 00:29:13,108
But Winn-Dixie gets lonely without me.

282
00:29:13,195 --> 00:29:15,484
Well...

283
00:29:15,572 --> 00:29:17,898
Maybe we could make an exception.

284
00:29:17,991 --> 00:29:20,862
Now, one hot Thursday, way back then,

285
00:29:20,953 --> 00:29:25,994
I was sitting here in the library, and
all the doors and windows were wide open.

286
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:32,453
And I had my nose in a book,
until I noticed a very peculiar smell.

287
00:29:32,548 --> 00:29:35,632
A very strong smell.

288
00:29:36,677 --> 00:29:39,713
And I raised my eyes up slowly,

289
00:29:39,805 --> 00:29:45,179
and standing right in front of me was a bear,
a very large bear.

290
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:47,594
How large was it?

291
00:29:47,688 --> 00:29:51,982
At least four times the size of your dog.

292
00:29:52,067 --> 00:29:57,441
That big? Wow.
Then what happened?

293
00:29:57,489 --> 00:30:02,614
I very slowly and very carefully

294
00:30:02,703 --> 00:30:05,276
raised up the book I was reading.

295
00:30:05,372 --> 00:30:07,994
- What book was that?
<i>- War and Peace.</i>

296
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:12,081
And I carefully aimed it
and I threw it right at him.

297
00:30:12,171 --> 00:30:14,543
Begone!

298
00:30:16,091 --> 00:30:18,416
Good dog. Thank you.

299
00:30:21,096 --> 00:30:23,303
- And do you know what?
- No, ma'am. What?

300
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,964
This is what I will never forget.

301
00:30:27,102 --> 00:30:31,017
- He took the book with him.
- Nuh-uh.

302
00:30:31,106 --> 00:30:34,475
Yes, ma'am, he snatched it up and ran off.

303
00:30:35,611 --> 00:30:37,769
Did he ever come back?

304
00:30:37,863 --> 00:30:41,279
No. I never saw him again.

305
00:30:41,366 --> 00:30:44,071
Well, the men in town,
they used to tease me about it.

306
00:30:44,161 --> 00:30:48,455
They used to say, "Miss Franny, we saw
that bear of yours out in the woods today."

307
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:51,458
"He was reading <i>War and Peace</i>
and said it sure was good

308
00:30:51,543 --> 00:30:54,793
and he'd like to check it out again."

309
00:30:58,425 --> 00:31:02,340
I imagine I'm the only one
who even recalls that bear.

310
00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:06,630
You don't have a husband or children?

311
00:31:06,725 --> 00:31:09,263
I never married.

312
00:31:09,353 --> 00:31:11,808
Why not?

313
00:31:12,773 --> 00:31:15,180
I didn't have the need.

314
00:31:15,275 --> 00:31:17,434
But you don't have anyone.

315
00:31:18,153 --> 00:31:20,644
I have these books.

316
00:31:21,657 --> 00:31:26,485
Now, look at that.
That dog is smiling at me.

317
00:31:28,497 --> 00:31:32,329
Would you like to be friends,
you and me and Winn-Dixie.

318
00:31:34,002 --> 00:31:37,288
Would you want to be friends?

319
00:31:38,882 --> 00:31:41,290
Why, that would be fine.

320
00:31:42,344 --> 00:31:45,879
That would be grand, just grand.

321
00:31:46,849 --> 00:31:51,427
<i>Winn-Dixie was better at making friends</i>
<i>than anyone I had ever known.</i>

322
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,600
<i>I talked to him about everything</i>
<i>and he was a real good listener.</i>

323
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,730
<i>Just about everything good</i>
<i>that happened that summer</i>

324
00:32:01,822 --> 00:32:04,942
<i>happened because of Winn-Dixie.</i>

325
00:33:13,894 --> 00:33:15,685
Uh-oh!

326
00:33:18,649 --> 00:33:21,354
Dog. Dog!

327
00:33:22,111 --> 00:33:24,518
Otis, the animals!

328
00:33:28,075 --> 00:33:30,613
Help me here!

329
00:33:31,745 --> 00:33:34,663
Stop it, Winn-Dixie.

330
00:33:36,417 --> 00:33:39,038
Help me get 'em back in the cages.

331
00:33:39,128 --> 00:33:42,082
I'll get the rabbits.

332
00:33:42,881 --> 00:33:44,506
Idiot!

333
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:53,137
Come here, sweetie. Come here.

334
00:34:02,151 --> 00:34:04,274
- Play some more music.
- What?

335
00:34:04,361 --> 00:34:07,730
What I said was, play some more music, Otis.

336
00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:23,539
Far out. Do it again.

337
00:34:37,644 --> 00:34:40,598
Well, it seems to be working.

338
00:34:51,867 --> 00:34:54,572
I'm gonna go tell my mom about what I seen.

339
00:34:54,661 --> 00:34:56,820
That man's magic.

340
00:34:56,914 --> 00:34:59,202
He's a magic man.

341
00:35:01,085 --> 00:35:03,622
Bye, magic man. Bye, Opal.

342
00:35:15,682 --> 00:35:18,090
Are you really a magic man?

343
00:35:18,185 --> 00:35:21,518
I was just playing for the animals.

344
00:35:23,857 --> 00:35:27,606
They seem to... They seem to like it.

345
00:35:29,488 --> 00:35:33,735
Yes, sir. Did they escape from their cages?

346
00:35:34,785 --> 00:35:37,276
No, I left the cages open.

347
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:43,657
You just let 'em roam around?

348
00:35:43,752 --> 00:35:47,620
I don't know. It's no good being locked up.

349
00:35:47,714 --> 00:35:49,791
- Locked up.
- Shut up.

350
00:35:49,883 --> 00:35:52,588
Shut up. Idiot.

351
00:35:55,514 --> 00:35:58,219
Shouldn't you be sweeping up?

352
00:36:00,436 --> 00:36:04,018
- Why don't you sweep up?
- With your guitar?

353
00:36:04,106 --> 00:36:06,597
Just sweep up the place and...

354
00:36:08,694 --> 00:36:11,897
clean up a little bit of this mess.

355
00:36:45,814 --> 00:36:48,388
He doesn't want to be left alone, is all.

356
00:36:48,484 --> 00:36:52,433
- Can't we bring him?
- Can't bring a dog to church, Opal.

357
00:36:52,529 --> 00:36:56,112
Come on, we're gonna be late.
It's a big day for me.

358
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,032
He's scared we'll leave him for good
and never come back.

359
00:37:01,371 --> 00:37:05,583
- That mutt ain't got a home yet?
- No, not yet, but we're working on it.

360
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:08,158
I had a dog like that once myself.

361
00:37:08,253 --> 00:37:11,918
A real howler. I got him to shut up.

362
00:37:12,007 --> 00:37:14,794
- You did? How?
- I shot him.

363
00:37:14,885 --> 00:37:19,677
Well, you can't shoot a churchgoing dog.
It'd be a sin.

364
00:38:29,918 --> 00:38:34,545
All right. That's enough. Please, stop.
Everyone just stop, please.

365
00:38:36,467 --> 00:38:39,254
Thank you. Opal?

366
00:38:39,344 --> 00:38:42,215
He doesn't know the words, is all.

367
00:38:43,932 --> 00:38:48,060
But he sure is moved by the spirit.

368
00:38:48,145 --> 00:38:51,146
- Get that dog now.
- Yes, sir.

369
00:39:11,752 --> 00:39:13,828
Are dogs allowed in church?

370
00:39:14,797 --> 00:39:19,257
Sit. Sit.

371
00:39:20,427 --> 00:39:25,670
We recently celebrated the hundredth
anniversary of man learning to fly.

372
00:39:25,766 --> 00:39:30,428
Now, that's the sort of miracle
that we tend to take for granted nowadays.

373
00:39:30,521 --> 00:39:35,147
But for hundreds of years, man was taking
that same kind of leap of faith

374
00:39:35,234 --> 00:39:38,816
and falling right on his butt.

375
00:39:38,904 --> 00:39:43,400
Yeah, folks, they were tying themselves
to kites and home-made wings

376
00:39:43,492 --> 00:39:47,572
and hurling themselves off of barns
and crashing off of cliffs.

377
00:39:47,663 --> 00:39:50,070
So how did the Wright brothers do it,

378
00:39:50,165 --> 00:39:54,993
when everybody else
was nose-diving for centuries?

379
00:39:55,087 --> 00:39:59,464
- They saw the unique value...
- Don't even think about it.

380
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:05,339
Did you know that part of their wing design
was the same design as a railroad bridge?

381
00:40:05,431 --> 00:40:11,433
Yeah. Isn't that a genius leap,
using a bridge to fly?

382
00:40:12,271 --> 00:40:14,892
Keep on preaching. I got him!

383
00:40:14,982 --> 00:40:19,062
More importantly, they had each other.
Working as brothers...

384
00:40:24,867 --> 00:40:27,951
Working together we can lift this town up...

385
00:40:31,749 --> 00:40:36,576
By all just taking a leap of faith,
we can learn to fly.

386
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,422
Sorry.

387
00:40:39,506 --> 00:40:42,341
Opal, stop that dog!

388
00:41:08,035 --> 00:41:10,193
Never in my life...

389
00:41:10,287 --> 00:41:12,493
A dog catching a mouse.

390
00:41:38,649 --> 00:41:40,891
Let us pray...

391
00:41:46,824 --> 00:41:48,900
for this mouse.

392
00:42:15,769 --> 00:42:19,981
That sure was something. I bet Mama
would've gotten a big kick out of it.

393
00:42:20,065 --> 00:42:22,770
Opal, the dog cannot go back to church.

394
00:42:22,818 --> 00:42:28,441
Everybody was talking. They said they hadn't
had that much fun in church in a long while.

395
00:42:28,532 --> 00:42:30,608
Opal.

396
00:42:56,435 --> 00:42:58,926
Doesn't that look better?

397
00:43:03,484 --> 00:43:06,022
Now where are you taking me, Winn-Dixie?

398
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:10,690
- That dog looks like a dirty carpet.
- Yeah.

399
00:43:10,783 --> 00:43:15,279
I can hear you.
I can hear you guys behind me.

400
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:18,288
Watch out. That dog's
headed for the witch's house.

401
00:43:18,373 --> 00:43:21,493
Winn-Dixie, come back here!

402
00:43:23,879 --> 00:43:25,539
Winn-Dixie!

403
00:43:25,631 --> 00:43:28,797
You'd better go
get your dog out of there.

404
00:43:28,884 --> 00:43:31,422
Get lost, you baldheaded babies.

405
00:43:31,512 --> 00:43:35,640
Hey, that witch is gonna eat that dog
for dinner and you for dessert.

406
00:43:35,724 --> 00:43:38,891
I wouldn't go in, bologna-breath.

407
00:43:38,977 --> 00:43:44,564
Bologna-breath? You're just
a couple of skinny-armed chickens.

408
00:43:45,901 --> 00:43:49,851
We'll tell the preacher what happened to you.

409
00:44:09,425 --> 00:44:11,750
Winn-Dixie?

410
00:44:11,844 --> 00:44:14,002
Winn-Dixie, where are you?

411
00:44:19,643 --> 00:44:21,932
Give it here.

412
00:44:23,647 --> 00:44:26,482
Let go. Let it go.

413
00:44:27,735 --> 00:44:30,190
Give it! Give it to me.

414
00:44:31,155 --> 00:44:32,981
- Let it go, I said.
- Stop it!

415
00:44:33,073 --> 00:44:36,407
Oh!

416
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:40,904
Who's there?

417
00:44:40,998 --> 00:44:43,703
Please. Don't eat me.

418
00:44:43,792 --> 00:44:47,790
Don't eat me! I don't taste good,
I don't taste good! Please! Help!

419
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,707
Eat you? You silly child.
How could I eat you?

420
00:44:56,096 --> 00:44:59,714
Where's my dog? Did you eat my dog?

421
00:44:59,808 --> 00:45:06,522
Hardly. But he darn near bit my hand off
stealing my sandwich.

422
00:45:06,607 --> 00:45:09,608
Where is he? Where's the dog?

423
00:45:09,693 --> 00:45:12,065
Where's the dog?

424
00:45:17,618 --> 00:45:20,784
Where's the dog? Oh, I hear him. I hear him.

425
00:45:20,871 --> 00:45:24,370
He's smacking his lips.
He sure loves peanut butter.

426
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:27,245
Listen at him.

427
00:45:28,504 --> 00:45:30,829
I'm sorry he got on your property.

428
00:45:36,345 --> 00:45:39,050
My name's Opal.

429
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:41,926
My name is Gloria.

430
00:45:42,893 --> 00:45:44,969
Gloria Dump.

431
00:45:45,062 --> 00:45:48,597
Ain't that a terrible last name- Dump?

432
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:53,767
My last name's Buloni. Sometimes
the kids at school, they call me Lunchmeat.

433
00:45:53,862 --> 00:45:57,694
Lunchmeat. Oh, my.

434
00:45:57,783 --> 00:46:01,531
Well, I'm pleased to meet you, Lunchmeat.

435
00:46:03,747 --> 00:46:06,950
- What do you call your friend here?
- That's Winn-Dixie.

436
00:46:07,042 --> 00:46:11,751
Winn-Dixie? You mean like the grocery store?

437
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:17,877
Now, that takes the strange-name prize,
don't it? Whoo-wee!

438
00:46:26,728 --> 00:46:28,805
Oh, no.

439
00:46:29,773 --> 00:46:33,225
This one's mine. I'm gonna eat this one.

440
00:46:36,405 --> 00:46:38,943
You know, baby girl...

441
00:46:40,242 --> 00:46:43,528
these eyes of mine,
they don't see too good no more.

442
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:47,867
- You can't see?
- Well, no, I can...

443
00:46:48,917 --> 00:46:53,295
I can see only the general shape of things.

444
00:46:54,339 --> 00:46:56,961
So I rely on my heart.

445
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:04,048
Why don't you tell me everything about
yourself, so I can see you with my heart?

446
00:47:04,141 --> 00:47:06,217
Well, the first thing you should know

447
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:10,260
is my dad's the preacher,
which is why we moved to Naomi.

448
00:47:10,355 --> 00:47:15,563
<i>I had been waiting for so long to tell a person</i>
<i>everything about me, I couldn't stop.</i>

449
00:47:15,652 --> 00:47:17,775
<i>I told Gloria Dump everything.</i>

450
00:47:17,863 --> 00:47:21,279
<i>And the whole time I was talking,</i>
<i>Gloria Dump was listening.</i>

451
00:47:21,366 --> 00:47:23,573
I see. I see.

452
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:27,195
But the most important thing
you should know about me

453
00:47:27,289 --> 00:47:30,824
- is that I don't have a mama.
- You don't have a mama?

454
00:47:30,918 --> 00:47:36,671
Something happened to her that made her
go away, and I don't know what it was.

455
00:47:39,176 --> 00:47:42,177
<i>I could feel her listening with all her heart,</i>

456
00:47:42,262 --> 00:47:44,588
<i>and it felt good.</i>

457
00:48:03,534 --> 00:48:06,072
Winn-Dixie.

458
00:48:06,161 --> 00:48:08,035
Quiet, boy.

459
00:48:08,122 --> 00:48:10,529
Quiet. You'll wake the preacher.

460
00:48:12,209 --> 00:48:14,498
Oh, Winn-Dixie.

461
00:48:15,546 --> 00:48:18,037
Winn-Dixie, come back here.

462
00:48:18,924 --> 00:48:21,296
Argh!

463
00:48:22,261 --> 00:48:24,337
Opal!

464
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:27,635
Opal!

465
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:32,515
- What's going on with that dog?
- I don't know!

466
00:48:32,563 --> 00:48:36,014
Come on, Winn-Dixie.
Come on, come on. Argh!

467
00:48:36,108 --> 00:48:37,899
Winn-Dixie!

468
00:48:37,985 --> 00:48:40,523
I'm sorry. I don't know what's gotten into him.

469
00:48:40,612 --> 00:48:43,613
It's just thunder. It's OK.

470
00:48:50,205 --> 00:48:54,369
Daddy, what if he hurts himself?
What if he tries to get away?

471
00:48:56,587 --> 00:48:58,994
Daddy, what's happening?

472
00:48:59,089 --> 00:49:01,545
Let's get out of the way.

473
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:14,761
Do you know what a pathological fear is?
It's a fear that goes way beyond normal fears.

474
00:49:14,855 --> 00:49:18,935
It's a fear that you can't be talked out of,
can't be reasoned out of.

475
00:49:19,026 --> 00:49:23,487
I think Winn-Dixie has a pathological fear
of thunderstorms.

476
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:07,232
We get an awful lot of thunderstorms
in the summer.

477
00:50:11,537 --> 00:50:15,700
Well, we'll have to make sure
he doesn't get out during a storm.

478
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:17,867
He might run away.

479
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,752
- We'll have to make sure we keep him safe.
- Yes, sir.

480
00:50:42,901 --> 00:50:47,694
- I've been talking to Winn-Dixie.
- Oh, is that right?

481
00:50:49,783 --> 00:50:55,952
He thinks, since I'm ten years old, you should
tell me ten things about my mama.

482
00:50:56,999 --> 00:51:00,249
Why don't you just go back to bed, Opal?

483
00:51:06,425 --> 00:51:11,383
Just ten things, that's all.
One thing for each year I've been alive.

484
00:51:11,472 --> 00:51:15,220
He made it sound like a reasonable request.

485
00:51:16,935 --> 00:51:20,185
I should've known you'd be more trouble.

486
00:51:24,485 --> 00:51:26,726
You remind me so much of your mama.

487
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:29,821
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

488
00:51:30,866 --> 00:51:34,567
But that doesn't count as the first thing, OK?

489
00:51:35,621 --> 00:51:38,242
OK. All right.

490
00:51:39,291 --> 00:51:46,005
Ten things, and then it's off to bed, all right?
OK, let's see.

491
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:50,467
One, she was funny.
She could make just about anybody laugh.

492
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:57,388
Two, she had fair hair and big eyes.

493
00:51:57,476 --> 00:52:01,521
- Just like me.
- Exactly like you.

494
00:52:02,523 --> 00:52:05,440
- I kind of remember that.
- Do you?

495
00:52:07,778 --> 00:52:09,605
Good.

496
00:52:09,696 --> 00:52:13,030
Three, she liked to plant things.
She had a talent for it.

497
00:52:13,117 --> 00:52:17,364
She could stick a tire in the ground
and grow a car.

498
00:52:18,956 --> 00:52:24,377
Four, she could run. Oh, was she fast!
You could never race her.

499
00:52:24,461 --> 00:52:29,123
If you did, you couldn't let her get a head
start. Otherwise she'd beat you for sure.

500
00:52:29,216 --> 00:52:31,707
What's number five?

501
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:34,926
She couldn't cook.

502
00:52:35,013 --> 00:52:38,180
Burned everything, even water.

503
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:43,308
Six, your mama loved a good story.

504
00:52:43,397 --> 00:52:46,314
She could sit and listen
to anybody tell a story.

505
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,105
She especially liked funny ones.

506
00:52:49,153 --> 00:52:51,644
Cos she loved to laugh.

507
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:54,656
And what's number seven?

508
00:52:56,618 --> 00:52:59,109
She knew all the constellations.

509
00:52:59,204 --> 00:53:01,530
Every planet in the night-time sky.

510
00:53:03,876 --> 00:53:07,375
She could name 'em, point 'em out.

511
00:53:07,463 --> 00:53:10,499
She never got tired of looking up at 'em.

512
00:53:12,468 --> 00:53:14,923
Number eight...

513
00:53:20,309 --> 00:53:23,429
She hated being a preacher's wife.

514
00:53:32,029 --> 00:53:37,533
She said she couldn't stand
having all those ladies at church

515
00:53:37,618 --> 00:53:43,323
judging her on how she sang and
what she was wearing and what she cooked.

516
00:53:43,415 --> 00:53:48,077
She said it made her feel
like a bug under a microscope.

517
00:53:53,217 --> 00:53:55,672
What's the ninth thing?

518
00:53:55,761 --> 00:53:58,678
Number nine is...

519
00:54:00,265 --> 00:54:03,966
your mama loved you.
She loved you very much.

520
00:54:04,061 --> 00:54:06,433
But she left me.

521
00:54:06,522 --> 00:54:09,143
She left us.

522
00:54:09,233 --> 00:54:11,984
Why'd she leave us?

523
00:54:13,028 --> 00:54:17,524
She just... packed her bags and left us.

524
00:54:18,826 --> 00:54:20,902
Just...

525
00:54:21,912 --> 00:54:26,124
- Didn't leave one thing behind.
- She didn't leave anything?

526
00:54:26,208 --> 00:54:29,125
Nope. Nothing.

527
00:54:34,216 --> 00:54:36,707
What's number ten, Daddy?

528
00:54:39,805 --> 00:54:45,096
- I think that's enough for now.
- But that's only nine things.

529
00:54:47,187 --> 00:54:49,263
It's late.

530
00:54:50,315 --> 00:54:53,186
Think of number ten for me, won't you?

531
00:54:53,277 --> 00:54:55,602
Good night, Opal.

532
00:55:09,877 --> 00:55:14,954
<i>She could stick a tire</i>
<i>in the ground and grow a car.</i>

533
00:55:22,473 --> 00:55:25,343
<i>Burned everything, even water.</i>

534
00:55:30,355 --> 00:55:33,107
<i>She knew all the constellations.</i>

535
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:38,196
<i>She hated being a preacher's wife.</i>

536
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,032
<i>Made her feel like a bug under a microscope.</i>

537
00:55:52,711 --> 00:55:57,954
<i>That night I went over and over</i>
<i>the nine things the preacher had told me.</i>

538
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:01,170
<i>Then I wrote them down</i>
<i>just the way he had said them to me.</i>

539
00:56:01,261 --> 00:56:04,796
<i>That way, I would never forget them.</i>

540
00:56:54,398 --> 00:57:00,104
He shouldn't be away from his mom too long,
when they're this small.

541
00:57:07,035 --> 00:57:09,112
What kind of tree is this?

542
00:57:09,204 --> 00:57:12,988
- It's a wait-and-see tree.
- What's that mean?

543
00:57:13,083 --> 00:57:18,290
It means you gotta wait till it grows up
before you can see what it is.

544
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:20,456
Tight.

545
00:57:36,648 --> 00:57:40,598
- So you just drifted on into town?
- I told you everything.

546
00:57:40,694 --> 00:57:43,399
Morning, Otis.

547
00:57:43,447 --> 00:57:45,523
Well, well, well.

548
00:57:45,616 --> 00:57:48,570
How long have you known Mr. Otis here?

549
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:51,282
Not so long, I guess.

550
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:54,368
So I reckon you know Gertrude too?

551
00:57:55,375 --> 00:57:58,709
- Yes, I do.
- Winn-Dixie.

552
00:58:00,089 --> 00:58:03,458
Yet somehow you don't know Miss Gertrude.

553
00:58:06,303 --> 00:58:07,963
Hm?

554
00:58:08,055 --> 00:58:12,218
Nor why she'd leave her shop
in the hands of a drifter.

555
00:58:12,309 --> 00:58:14,385
Look, I told you that we're cousins.

556
00:58:14,478 --> 00:58:17,348
You ain't no cousin I know about, smiley.

557
00:58:17,439 --> 00:58:20,974
I told you her mama's sick
and she asked me to look after this store.

558
00:58:21,068 --> 00:58:25,018
Well, aren't you
a big, steaming pile of pancakes

559
00:58:25,114 --> 00:58:30,488
Don't you have anyone else's day you can
ruin? Why come in here? Leave me alone.

560
00:58:30,577 --> 00:58:32,570
Well, well, well.

561
00:58:32,663 --> 00:58:36,530
Somebody's all fired-up on budgie food.

562
00:58:36,625 --> 00:58:40,705
Now, you, we're gonna go outside
and have a little talk, me and you.

563
00:58:40,796 --> 00:58:43,369
Leave the girl alone.

564
00:58:44,425 --> 00:58:47,924
Someone better shut their gob hole.

565
00:58:48,011 --> 00:58:55,010
Come on, little one. Get you out
of the presence of Mr. Ravioli over here.

566
00:58:57,729 --> 00:58:59,806
Come on.

567
00:59:00,816 --> 00:59:02,939
Come on, now.

568
00:59:04,987 --> 00:59:08,652
Now, you don't know so much
about that fella in there, do you?

569
00:59:08,741 --> 00:59:10,817
I know he can sing near anything.

570
00:59:10,909 --> 00:59:14,243
Oh, yeah, he can sing all right.
Like a bird in a cage.

571
00:59:14,329 --> 00:59:18,707
- Did he tell you he was locked up in jail?
- I don't know anything about that.

572
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,285
The preacher know you're working here?

573
00:59:22,379 --> 00:59:25,250
I didn't think so. Yous better watch out.

574
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:28,875
Hey. Hey! No! Get away from there!

575
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:32,089
You are in violation of ordinance 2902,

576
00:59:32,181 --> 00:59:36,013
the ramming of a horny head
into a police vehicle.

577
00:59:36,101 --> 00:59:37,726
Ow.

578
00:59:37,811 --> 00:59:41,595
Don't you sass me, you naughty goose.

579
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:45,735
Hey, Elvis. You stupid or- ow! -just stoned?

580
00:59:45,819 --> 00:59:48,904
Get out here and help me!
Get away, you freaks!

581
00:59:51,575 --> 00:59:53,283
Argh!

582
00:59:53,368 --> 00:59:58,161
Get away from me, you hairy barnyard freaks.

583
00:59:58,248 --> 00:59:59,791
Ugh!

584
01:00:04,338 --> 01:00:06,663
Argh!

585
01:00:06,757 --> 01:00:09,674
I got this lousy goose on me!

586
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,176
10-59! Agh, I went through a stop sign!

587
01:00:17,518 --> 01:00:19,641
You're such a goody-goody.

588
01:00:19,728 --> 01:00:25,434
Shouldn't the preacher's daughter
be at home studying the Bible?

589
01:00:32,741 --> 01:00:36,869
I saw you with the police.
You're so busted.

590
01:00:37,371 --> 01:00:42,448
- That pet shop man is a retarded criminal.
- You don't know anything.

591
01:00:42,543 --> 01:00:47,454
I know the preacher wouldn't like
you hanging round with criminals.

592
01:00:47,548 --> 01:00:50,999
- Lay off her, Stevie.
- I don't care what you guys say.

593
01:00:52,052 --> 01:00:55,302
Go pick your lice, booger-eaters.

594
01:00:55,389 --> 01:00:57,962
Dang, Opal.

595
01:00:58,058 --> 01:01:00,217
How about telling me a story?

596
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:03,644
Once upon a time,
I hated the Dewberry boys.

597
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:07,182
- The end.
- Oh, stop that nonsense.

598
01:01:08,193 --> 01:01:11,942
I do hate them. They're ignorant.
They think you're a witch.

599
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:15,649
Oh, they're just trying to get your attention.

600
01:01:15,743 --> 01:01:18,779
I bet they like you.

601
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:24,575
Gloria, you know Otis?

602
01:01:24,668 --> 01:01:29,081
No, I don't know Otis,
but I do know what you told me about him.

603
01:01:29,173 --> 01:01:31,628
You know he's a criminal? He's been in jail.

604
01:01:31,717 --> 01:01:35,631
Baby girl, come on,
I want to show you something.

605
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:50,640
- See this tree?
- Yeah.

606
01:01:50,736 --> 01:01:55,896
- Why are all those bottles on it?
- To keep the ghosts away.

607
01:01:56,408 --> 01:01:58,946
What ghosts?

608
01:01:59,036 --> 01:02:02,321
Ghosts of all the things I've done wrong.

609
01:02:03,373 --> 01:02:06,707
You did that many things wrong?

610
01:02:06,794 --> 01:02:09,367
More than that, baby girl.

611
01:02:10,422 --> 01:02:12,545
But you're not a bad person.

612
01:02:12,633 --> 01:02:15,966
Doesn't mean I haven't done bad things.

613
01:02:16,053 --> 01:02:19,801
But there's whisky bottles on there.
And beer bottles.

614
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:23,093
That's right. I know that.

615
01:02:23,185 --> 01:02:29,437
I'm the one what drank what was in 'em,
and I'm the one what put 'em up there.

616
01:02:30,526 --> 01:02:32,602
Oh, baby girl.

617
01:02:33,737 --> 01:02:39,194
You know, a lot of folks
have problems with liquor and beer.

618
01:02:40,452 --> 01:02:44,616
They get to start drinking
and can't get stopped.

619
01:02:44,706 --> 01:02:48,241
- Are you one of those people?
- Yes, I am.

620
01:02:49,294 --> 01:02:55,000
But you know something? These days,
I don't drink nothing stronger than coffee.

621
01:02:55,676 --> 01:03:01,132
Did the whisky and beer and wine make you
do all those bad things that are ghosts now?

622
01:03:01,223 --> 01:03:08,056
Some of 'em. Some of 'em I would've done
anyway, with or without the liquor and beer.

623
01:03:08,814 --> 01:03:11,186
Till I learned.

624
01:03:11,275 --> 01:03:13,682
Learned what?

625
01:03:15,821 --> 01:03:18,608
Till I learned
what was the most important thing.

626
01:03:18,699 --> 01:03:21,320
What's that?

627
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:25,277
It's different for everyone.
Gotta learn it on your own.

628
01:03:26,623 --> 01:03:30,704
But, you know, we should judge Otis

629
01:03:30,794 --> 01:03:33,879
by the pretty music that he makes

630
01:03:33,964 --> 01:03:37,748
and how kind he is to all them animals.

631
01:03:37,843 --> 01:03:40,879
Cos that's all we know about him now.

632
01:03:40,971 --> 01:03:43,889
- Right?
- Yes, ma'am.

633
01:03:49,438 --> 01:03:51,514
All right, then.

634
01:04:15,339 --> 01:04:18,790
Miss Franny, I've got this friend
named Gloria Dump.

635
01:04:18,884 --> 01:04:24,969
And she really loves to read, only
her eyes are bad, so she can't read any more.

636
01:04:25,057 --> 01:04:27,927
So I was thinking
maybe I could read her a story.

637
01:04:28,018 --> 01:04:32,763
- Do you have any suggestions?
- Of course I have suggestions.

638
01:04:33,732 --> 01:04:37,101
- What about <i>Gone with the Wind?</i>
- What's that about?

639
01:04:37,194 --> 01:04:41,523
Oh, it's a wonderful, exciting story
about the Civil War.

640
01:04:41,615 --> 01:04:43,157
The Civil War?

641
01:04:43,242 --> 01:04:46,860
Now, Opal, don't tell me
you have never heard of the Civil War.

642
01:04:46,954 --> 01:04:50,287
It was the war between
the North and the South over slavery.

643
01:04:50,374 --> 01:04:56,792
That's right, Opal. My great-grandfather,
Littmus W. Block, fought in that war.

644
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,507
- I'm ready for another book.
- Amanda, maybe you wouldn't mind waiting.

645
01:05:01,593 --> 01:05:05,009
I was just telling Opal
a story about my great-grandfather.

646
01:05:05,097 --> 01:05:09,806
I sure would like to hear a story
about your great-grandfather.

647
01:05:09,893 --> 01:05:14,970
Now, Littmus, only a boy of 14,
went off to be a hero.

648
01:05:15,065 --> 01:05:17,473
But he soon found out the truth.

649
01:05:17,568 --> 01:05:21,233
- What truth?
- That war is hell, pure hell.

650
01:05:21,321 --> 01:05:25,105
- "Hell" is a cuss word.
- Well, "war" is a cuss word too.

651
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:29,447
I mean, neither of you can imagine.
Littmus was hungry all the time.

652
01:05:29,538 --> 01:05:34,081
He was covered with all manner of vermin-
fleas and lice.

653
01:05:34,168 --> 01:05:36,493
And he was constantly being shot at.

654
01:05:36,587 --> 01:05:41,379
He suffered in a way that no boy should
ever have to suffer, and it changed him.

655
01:05:42,342 --> 01:05:45,094
Shoot. I can't see nothing.

656
01:05:48,557 --> 01:05:51,973
- Probably ain't nothing to see.
- Come on, Dunlap.

657
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:56,806
You gotta think like a secret agent.
You gotta think like a spy.

658
01:05:56,899 --> 01:05:59,354
He walked back home when the war was over.

659
01:05:59,443 --> 01:06:03,108
He walked from Virginia
all the way to Georgia.

660
01:06:03,197 --> 01:06:09,069
But when he got there, his parents, his
sisters- everything and everyone was gone.

661
01:06:09,161 --> 01:06:12,494
But what about his sisters?
What happened to them?

662
01:06:12,581 --> 01:06:15,499
Dead. Dead from typhoid fever.

663
01:06:15,584 --> 01:06:18,585
- And his mama?
- Dead too.

664
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:20,829
And his father?

665
01:06:21,757 --> 01:06:23,963
He died on the battlefield.

666
01:06:24,051 --> 01:06:27,550
People were dying all over the place.
His whole family's dead.

667
01:06:27,638 --> 01:06:29,262
I wanna hear.

668
01:06:29,348 --> 01:06:31,424
So Littmus was an orphan?

669
01:06:31,517 --> 01:06:35,514
Yes. Poor Littmus was all alone in the world.

670
01:06:38,357 --> 01:06:40,480
Well...

671
01:06:40,567 --> 01:06:46,570
When he finished crying,
he had the strangest sensation.

672
01:06:47,533 --> 01:06:52,076
He wanted something sweet.
He wanted a piece of candy.

673
01:06:52,162 --> 01:06:58,699
Yes, ma'am. Littmus W. Block
figured that the world was a sorry affair

674
01:06:58,794 --> 01:07:01,499
and had enough ugly things in it,

675
01:07:01,547 --> 01:07:06,588
and what he was going to do
was put something sweet in it.

676
01:07:06,677 --> 01:07:09,547
Let me see.

677
01:07:12,933 --> 01:07:14,511
Quiet!

678
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:19,010
- Would you care for a Littmus Lozenge?
- Yes, please.

679
01:07:19,773 --> 01:07:21,054
Thank you.

680
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:23,308
Now, they're not made any more.

681
01:07:23,402 --> 01:07:26,771
The world, it seems,
lost its appetite for Littmus Lozenges.

682
01:07:26,864 --> 01:07:30,813
Fortunately I had the foresight to save a few.

683
01:07:35,789 --> 01:07:38,743
- Do you like it?
- Yes, ma'am.

684
01:07:40,252 --> 01:07:42,410
What about you, Amanda?

685
01:07:42,504 --> 01:07:45,956
Yes, ma'am. But it makes me feel sad.

686
01:07:46,049 --> 01:07:49,881
There is a secret ingredient in there.

687
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:52,295
What is it?

688
01:07:52,389 --> 01:07:54,797
Sorrow.

689
01:07:54,892 --> 01:07:56,968
Not everybody can taste it.

690
01:07:57,060 --> 01:08:00,844
- I taste it.
- Me too.

691
01:08:00,939 --> 01:08:06,230
Well, then, you've probably both
had your share of sadness.

692
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,727
The world has changed so much.

693
01:08:08,822 --> 01:08:11,823
People in Naomi used to
know each other's sadnesses.

694
01:08:11,909 --> 01:08:14,447
They used to rely on each other.

695
01:08:14,536 --> 01:08:19,032
This town just isn't the same
without the candy factory.

696
01:08:19,124 --> 01:08:21,995
But how do you get sadness
into a piece of candy?

697
01:08:22,086 --> 01:08:24,577
Yeah, how do you get that taste in there?

698
01:08:25,297 --> 01:08:28,168
That is the mystery.

699
01:08:28,258 --> 01:08:31,627
That's how Littmus made his fortune.

700
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:37,094
By manufacturing a candy
that tasted sweet and sad at the same time.

701
01:08:39,728 --> 01:08:42,219
Man, we missed out on the candy.

702
01:08:42,314 --> 01:08:46,098
Now they're just sitting around,
talking about how they feel.

703
01:08:46,193 --> 01:08:48,482
Come on.

704
01:09:00,582 --> 01:09:03,453
I had to move away from Watley

705
01:09:03,544 --> 01:09:06,498
and leave all my friends behind.

706
01:09:06,588 --> 01:09:09,162
That's one sadness I've known.

707
01:09:10,217 --> 01:09:12,708
And my mama.

708
01:09:12,803 --> 01:09:15,508
I don't know my mama.

709
01:09:15,556 --> 01:09:18,260
I only know a few things about her.

710
01:09:18,308 --> 01:09:21,724
There's something the preacher won't tell me.

711
01:09:21,812 --> 01:09:25,097
- Makes me think of Carson.
- Hey, guys.

712
01:09:25,691 --> 01:09:27,933
Bookworms. Where's your apples?

713
01:09:28,402 --> 01:09:30,857
I have to go.

714
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:34,991
- What's with her?
- Who's Carson?

715
01:09:36,201 --> 01:09:38,573
Carson was Amanda's brother.

716
01:09:38,662 --> 01:09:40,322
Was?

717
01:09:41,206 --> 01:09:43,413
He drowned last year.

718
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:45,908
I saw the whole thing.

719
01:09:46,003 --> 01:09:48,790
Come on, Dunlap.

720
01:10:00,976 --> 01:10:04,843
<i>Gloria said that Naomi</i>
<i>was like one big mistake tree</i>

721
01:10:04,938 --> 01:10:11,273
<i>and every person was its own bottle</i>
<i>hanging in the wind, all empty and alone.</i>

722
01:10:11,361 --> 01:10:17,316
<i>Miss Franny thought it had been that way</i>
<i>ever since the candy factory closed years ago.</i>

723
01:10:17,409 --> 01:10:22,451
<i>People lost more than their jobs.</i>
<i>They lost each other.</i>

724
01:10:27,836 --> 01:10:29,912
Tastes like music.

725
01:10:39,306 --> 01:10:41,382
Reminds me of...

726
01:10:42,434 --> 01:10:44,510
being in jail.

727
01:10:46,814 --> 01:10:49,850
Otis, what were you in jail for?

728
01:10:53,112 --> 01:10:56,694
You don't have to tell me.
I was just wondering.

729
01:10:57,616 --> 01:11:01,199
I never hurt anybody.

730
01:11:01,286 --> 01:11:03,362
Never meant to.

731
01:11:03,455 --> 01:11:06,160
But I've been locked up.

732
01:11:07,543 --> 01:11:09,619
And I remember the day very well.

733
01:11:09,711 --> 01:11:13,246
I was sitting in a park, playing a little music,

734
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:18,085
and there were people walking their dogs,
and children were laughing.

735
01:11:18,178 --> 01:11:23,718
It was a perfect day,
so I felt like playing music.

736
01:11:25,018 --> 01:11:30,724
I put my hat out there,
but I wasn't really playing for money.

737
01:11:30,816 --> 01:11:34,564
I just thought that maybe
if someone was enjoying it,

738
01:11:34,653 --> 01:11:38,271
they might throw a little change in there.

739
01:11:39,867 --> 01:11:44,659
- Or not.
- Music is better if somebody's listening.

740
01:11:44,747 --> 01:11:46,823
Anyway, this...

741
01:11:49,168 --> 01:11:51,456
this policeman came up to me.

742
01:11:51,545 --> 01:11:54,499
He said I was disturbing the peace.

743
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:59,667
And then he tried to take my guitar away
from me. I guess I got real angry at him.

744
01:12:02,806 --> 01:12:05,511
But I'm not a bad man.

745
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:20,862
Anyway, they told me
that I broke that policeman's nose.

746
01:12:22,868 --> 01:12:26,569
And they charged me
with assault on a police officer.

747
01:12:27,164 --> 01:12:29,916
And no matter what I said,
they wouldn't listen.

748
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,250
No matter what I said, they wouldn't...

749
01:12:34,546 --> 01:12:37,298
They gave me three years.

750
01:12:37,382 --> 01:12:40,502
I said I'm not a bad man, I'm just...

751
01:12:48,936 --> 01:12:52,352
But you, when I look at you...

752
01:13:33,188 --> 01:13:36,355
<i>I swept the floor real slow that day.</i>

753
01:13:36,442 --> 01:13:39,146
<i>I wanted to keep Otis company.</i>

754
01:13:39,194 --> 01:13:41,981
<i>I didn't want him to be lonely.</i>

755
01:13:42,072 --> 01:13:48,241
<i>Sometimes it seemed to me like</i>
<i>everybody in the whole world was lonely.</i>

756
01:13:49,621 --> 01:13:51,744
Yuck.

757
01:13:51,832 --> 01:13:54,323
That tastes bad.

758
01:13:54,418 --> 01:13:57,621
That tastes like not having a dog.

759
01:13:57,713 --> 01:14:00,334
<i>I wondered if my mama,</i>

760
01:14:00,424 --> 01:14:02,500
<i>wherever she was,</i>

761
01:14:02,593 --> 01:14:04,669
<i>was lonely for me.</i>

762
01:14:04,762 --> 01:14:08,842
<i>Thinking about her was like the hole</i>
<i>you keep on feeling with your tongue</i>

763
01:14:08,932 --> 01:14:11,008
<i>after you lose a tooth.</i>

764
01:14:11,101 --> 01:14:15,929
<i>Time after time, my mind</i>
<i>kept on going to that empty spot.</i>

765
01:14:16,023 --> 01:14:19,356
<i>The spot where I felt like she should be.</i>

766
01:14:22,738 --> 01:14:25,145
Here! Here!

767
01:14:31,413 --> 01:14:35,328
What do you think?
Should we give some to the boys?

768
01:14:37,461 --> 01:14:39,750
Yeah. They haven't been very nice.

769
01:14:39,838 --> 01:14:42,294
They never want to play with us.

770
01:14:42,382 --> 01:14:44,422
Try this one, Dunlap.

771
01:14:48,764 --> 01:14:52,133
- Winn-Dixie.
- I got it! I got it!

772
01:14:54,728 --> 01:14:57,682
I got it! I got it!

773
01:14:59,024 --> 01:15:02,191
- Whoa!
- There he is. Get him!

774
01:15:04,321 --> 01:15:07,026
Just get him.

775
01:15:13,789 --> 01:15:16,494
Help. Help me, Dunlap.

776
01:15:23,674 --> 01:15:27,754
What in the name of corn on the cob
is going on around here?

777
01:15:27,845 --> 01:15:30,336
Have we got a situation here, fellas?

778
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:32,756
No, sir. They're just all playing.

779
01:15:33,851 --> 01:15:36,472
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Keep away from me.

780
01:15:38,313 --> 01:15:40,140
Argh!

781
01:15:41,859 --> 01:15:44,017
Get off of me! Ow!

782
01:15:44,111 --> 01:15:46,981
Get off of me,
you hairy, heavy-metal hound dog.

783
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:51,406
Give me my pants back.
Oh, that's a wedgie.

784
01:15:53,078 --> 01:15:55,118
Argh!

785
01:15:55,205 --> 01:15:58,123
This whole town's gone mad!

786
01:15:59,752 --> 01:16:04,045
- Look, he has chicken legs.
- I suppose you think this is funny.

787
01:16:06,717 --> 01:16:08,544
Oh!

788
01:16:09,470 --> 01:16:11,628
Don't look at me.

789
01:16:13,515 --> 01:16:18,557
He wasn't trying to hurt you.
He just wanted to give you a candy.

790
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:24,025
You little sea monkeys.
I'm gonna see you in sea-monkey jail.

791
01:16:25,861 --> 01:16:27,984
I'd better put it in drive.

792
01:16:52,971 --> 01:16:56,091
What's wrong? You all right?

793
01:17:01,438 --> 01:17:03,230
Oh, Winn-Dixie!

794
01:17:03,315 --> 01:17:07,099
How many did you eat of these?

795
01:17:07,194 --> 01:17:10,195
Oh, that's gross.

796
01:17:13,867 --> 01:17:15,409
Oh, Winn-Dixie.

797
01:17:15,494 --> 01:17:19,539
Opal, I hope you don't
have that dog in your bed.

798
01:17:51,071 --> 01:17:53,396
- Daddy?
- Opal.

799
01:17:53,907 --> 01:17:57,691
It's two in the morning.
What are you doing up?

800
01:18:01,957 --> 01:18:05,955
Daddy, are you hungry?
Were you looking for something to eat?

801
01:18:06,044 --> 01:18:08,666
Yeah, that's it. I'm hungry.

802
01:18:15,095 --> 01:18:17,800
Try this.

803
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:22,636
- What's this?
- A Littmus Lozenge.

804
01:18:34,907 --> 01:18:37,777
Do you like it?

805
01:18:38,827 --> 01:18:41,828
A candy that tastes melancholy.

806
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:46,207
- What's "melancholy"?
- Sad.

807
01:18:47,377 --> 01:18:49,666
It's supposed to taste sad.

808
01:18:50,714 --> 01:18:53,205
It makes me think of your mother.

809
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:56,634
Do you think about her a lot?

810
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:59,258
I do, Opal.

811
01:18:59,348 --> 01:19:02,432
Daddy, did she drink?

812
01:19:02,518 --> 01:19:06,017
There are some things
you're just too young to understand.

813
01:19:06,105 --> 01:19:09,224
I understand a lot of things.

814
01:19:10,692 --> 01:19:14,311
I know about people with drinking problems.

815
01:19:14,405 --> 01:19:17,240
Gloria Dump had a drinking problem.

816
01:19:18,325 --> 01:19:21,611
I want to understand.

817
01:19:21,703 --> 01:19:26,496
I don't even understand
what happened with your mama.

818
01:19:28,919 --> 01:19:32,039
We were happy, I know that,
for a long time.

819
01:19:34,466 --> 01:19:37,835
It seemed like a long time we were happy.

820
01:19:40,222 --> 01:19:42,713
Then she started drinking.

821
01:19:42,808 --> 01:19:45,050
She started drinking?

822
01:19:46,103 --> 01:19:49,057
And that's the tenth thing?

823
01:19:50,983 --> 01:19:54,186
But it's more complicated than that.

824
01:19:55,863 --> 01:20:00,323
Did she drink because I was bad?
Is it my fault that she left?

825
01:20:00,409 --> 01:20:02,485
No. No! It's not your fault.

826
01:20:02,578 --> 01:20:06,492
Don't ever say it's your fault.

827
01:20:08,459 --> 01:20:10,831
Don't ever say that.

828
01:20:12,671 --> 01:20:16,539
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

829
01:20:24,641 --> 01:20:28,509
<i>I thought about how life</i>
<i>was like a Littmus Lozenge.</i>

830
01:20:28,604 --> 01:20:32,436
<i>How the sweet and the sad</i>
<i>were all mixed up together,</i>

831
01:20:32,524 --> 01:20:35,727
<i>and how hard it was to separate them out.</i>

832
01:21:02,262 --> 01:21:04,753
He's so angry.

833
01:21:05,808 --> 01:21:08,927
He's hurting, that's why.

834
01:21:09,019 --> 01:21:11,095
Everybody's hurting.

835
01:21:11,188 --> 01:21:13,893
It makes me feel sad.

836
01:21:13,941 --> 01:21:16,562
I want to help him,

837
01:21:16,652 --> 01:21:19,357
but I just don't know what to do.

838
01:21:20,364 --> 01:21:24,112
Well, don't dwell on it, child.

839
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:31,614
Why don't we see what Miss Scarlett's doing?

840
01:21:31,708 --> 01:21:34,994
I believe she's getting ready for that party.

841
01:21:37,047 --> 01:21:39,123
That's what <i>we</i> need to do.

842
01:21:42,845 --> 01:21:47,056
- "We" who?
- We. Me and you. We should have a party.

843
01:21:47,141 --> 01:21:50,759
Don't you think we should
have a party, Winn-Dixie?

844
01:21:50,853 --> 01:21:53,972
We can invite Miss Franny Block,
the preacher and Otis.

845
01:21:54,064 --> 01:21:57,729
- Opal, don't go in there!
- Come on, we need to start planning.

846
01:21:57,818 --> 01:22:00,653
- No!
- Wow. It's dark in here.

847
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:04,447
Hold on now. Opal.

848
01:22:05,492 --> 01:22:08,244
Opal? Where are you?

849
01:22:08,328 --> 01:22:11,780
- You see? That's a lot better.
- Close those curtains.

850
01:22:11,874 --> 01:22:14,080
- Come on.
- Stop it!

851
01:22:14,168 --> 01:22:16,456
You cannot have any party here.

852
01:22:16,545 --> 01:22:19,996
I haven't had folks in here for years.

853
01:22:20,090 --> 01:22:24,135
We could just make sandwiches,
and Otis can bring his guitar.

854
01:22:24,219 --> 01:22:26,793
I said no, and that's the end of it.

855
01:22:28,265 --> 01:22:30,970
Miss Franny said
the problem with people here

856
01:22:31,018 --> 01:22:33,591
is that they forgot
how to share their sadness.

857
01:22:33,687 --> 01:22:37,815
But what I think is that people forgot
how to share their joy.

858
01:22:38,984 --> 01:22:41,819
Oh, Winn-Dixie.

859
01:22:44,323 --> 01:22:47,028
Gloria, we need this party.

860
01:22:50,704 --> 01:22:54,287
- Please.
- Oh, Lord.

861
01:22:57,002 --> 01:22:59,078
Child.

862
01:23:01,548 --> 01:23:05,249
Well, if we're gonna have a party...

863
01:23:06,637 --> 01:23:11,631
this house needs a big pick-up
if we're gonna have folks over.

864
01:23:11,725 --> 01:23:13,634
Whoo! We're having a party.

865
01:23:13,727 --> 01:23:19,730
We're gonna have a party, and don't you
forget to invite them Dewberry boys.

866
01:23:25,614 --> 01:23:27,322
Thank you, Opal.

867
01:23:36,417 --> 01:23:37,911
Thanks.

868
01:23:48,053 --> 01:23:50,260
Fruit.

869
01:24:07,781 --> 01:24:10,355
Winn-Dixie!

870
01:24:19,376 --> 01:24:21,535
You're gonna come, right?

871
01:24:21,628 --> 01:24:23,787
Yeah. I'll be there.

872
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:28,505
Should be done with prayer group by then.

873
01:24:29,762 --> 01:24:32,679
We're having a party, and you're invited.

874
01:24:41,231 --> 01:24:44,932
You don't have to thank me.
It was Winn-Dixie's idea.

875
01:24:48,197 --> 01:24:50,604
Come on, Winn-Dixie.

876
01:24:50,699 --> 01:24:52,074
Come on.

877
01:24:56,121 --> 01:24:57,781
Little miss?

878
01:24:57,873 --> 01:25:00,625
He don't howl so much any more.

879
01:25:00,709 --> 01:25:03,627
He's not so lonely any more.

880
01:25:09,968 --> 01:25:12,044
Come on.

881
01:25:17,059 --> 01:25:21,306
- Mr. Alfred, you're one of the first people here.
- No sense dilly-dallying.

882
01:25:21,396 --> 01:25:23,970
- Hello, Opal.
- Hi, Miss Franny.

883
01:25:24,066 --> 01:25:26,818
- Mr. Alfred, do you know Miss Franny?
- No.

884
01:25:26,902 --> 01:25:30,603
- Miss Franny. Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

885
01:25:34,034 --> 01:25:36,525
I brung dog pictures for the party.

886
01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:38,696
Oh. That's great, Sweetie Pie.

887
01:25:38,789 --> 01:25:40,865
Let me show you.

888
01:25:41,875 --> 01:25:44,449
Come on, Winn-Dixie.

889
01:25:44,545 --> 01:25:48,079
- Oh, wow. They're beautiful.
- Hey, Opal.

890
01:25:48,173 --> 01:25:52,669
Oh, hey, Amanda.
I'm so glad you could come.

891
01:25:52,761 --> 01:25:56,047
- Thank you for inviting me.
- Thanks for coming.

892
01:25:58,183 --> 01:26:01,018
Gloria! Gloria!

893
01:26:01,895 --> 01:26:05,015
I'm coming, I'm coming.

894
01:26:06,358 --> 01:26:09,608
I'm coming, baby girl.
Please don't rush me.

895
01:26:09,695 --> 01:26:13,693
I'm so nervous.
I haven't done this in such a long time.

896
01:26:14,742 --> 01:26:17,992
It's OK. You look beautiful.

897
01:26:18,078 --> 01:26:22,539
Well, thank you for my hair and
my fingernails. And you look pretty too.

898
01:26:22,624 --> 01:26:25,115
- You wearing that necklace I gave you?
- Mm-hm.

899
01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:30,797
Oh, everything is so beautiful, Opal.
I can see it. I can just see it.

900
01:26:30,883 --> 01:26:33,374
- Hi, Gloria.
- Who's that?

901
01:26:34,470 --> 01:26:37,506
Gloria, I'd like you to meet
my new friend Amanda.

902
01:26:37,598 --> 01:26:41,216
Amanda? What a beautiful name.
I'm glad you came.

903
01:26:41,310 --> 01:26:43,516
Me too.

904
01:26:44,563 --> 01:26:48,395
- And this is Miss Franny Block.
- Hello, Gloria. I've heard all about you.

905
01:26:48,484 --> 01:26:52,232
- I hope you're enjoying <i>Gone with the Wind.</i>
- Thank you.

906
01:26:52,321 --> 01:26:57,279
- And that's Mr. Alfred.
- Miss Gloria, I'm delighted to meet you.

907
01:26:57,367 --> 01:26:59,941
I had no idea all this was back here.

908
01:27:00,037 --> 01:27:04,829
- Hey, Otis.
- Otis. Uh-oh.

909
01:27:04,917 --> 01:27:08,914
It's all right. It's just a few people.
Hardly any people at all.

910
01:27:09,004 --> 01:27:14,211
- I brought pickles.
- Oh! That's just exactly what we needed.

911
01:27:14,301 --> 01:27:18,880
They'll go perfectly
with the egg salad sandwiches.

912
01:27:20,808 --> 01:27:23,049
Miss Franny, this is Otis.

913
01:27:27,731 --> 01:27:29,807
It's a pleasure to shake your hand.

914
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:33,316
- Thank you. I brought pickles.
- Yes, I see. It's nice.

915
01:27:33,404 --> 01:27:36,321
Oh, and this is Gloria Dump.

916
01:27:37,449 --> 01:27:40,367
I brought pickles for the party.

917
01:27:41,745 --> 01:27:43,987
I'm glad you did.

918
01:27:44,081 --> 01:27:47,366
I mean, it wouldn't be no party
without pickles.

919
01:27:47,459 --> 01:27:51,243
Now, I've been to several parties
with no pickles.

920
01:27:51,338 --> 01:27:53,912
And not one of 'em was any fun.

921
01:27:54,007 --> 01:27:58,088
Otis, you can put the pickles down
right over here.

922
01:27:58,178 --> 01:28:03,765
Baby girl? What happened with the Dewberry
boys? And where's the preacher?

923
01:28:03,851 --> 01:28:07,101
I don't know. I told them
what time we were starting.

924
01:28:09,857 --> 01:28:12,348
Look at that dog and look at that bird.

925
01:28:12,443 --> 01:28:14,649
Oh, no, Winn-Dixie.

926
01:28:14,737 --> 01:28:17,025
No, Winn-Dixie.

927
01:28:17,114 --> 01:28:21,194
Get down, get down.
Winn-Dixie, come on.

928
01:28:21,285 --> 01:28:24,985
Well, if we don't eat soon,
there won't be any food left.

929
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:30,122
I think you're right. Let's just
hold hands and give thanks for this.

930
01:28:31,795 --> 01:28:35,663
Opal, give me your hand. Winn-Dixie, sit.

931
01:28:35,758 --> 01:28:39,921
Dear Lord and heavenly Father,
we have egg salad sandwiches,

932
01:28:40,012 --> 01:28:43,345
we got Dump's punch, we got pickles,

933
01:28:43,432 --> 01:28:47,928
we got doggy pictures
and we have Littmus Lozenges.

934
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:51,389
But more importantly, dear Lord,
we have good friends.

935
01:28:51,482 --> 01:28:56,227
Dear Lord, we got good friends
to share this warm summer night with us.

936
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,194
And for that we're grateful.

937
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:01,779
Teach us, dear Lord, to love one another.

938
01:29:02,826 --> 01:29:05,946
This we ask in your name. Amen.

939
01:29:06,038 --> 01:29:07,912
Amen.

940
01:29:07,998 --> 01:29:13,158
- Are we fixing to eat now?
- I think we might wanna eat inside.

941
01:29:13,253 --> 01:29:16,373
It's not supposed to rain.

942
01:29:16,465 --> 01:29:21,708
- Oh, my gosh!
- Get everything out of the rain!

943
01:29:21,804 --> 01:29:24,508
Get the sandwiches. Get the punch.

944
01:29:24,556 --> 01:29:28,305
Somebody get the punch!
Get the sandwiches.

945
01:29:35,442 --> 01:29:39,191
Oh, yes, I'm cleaned up real good now.

946
01:29:40,781 --> 01:29:44,529
Did you get the sandwiches?
Somebody get the sandwiches?

947
01:29:44,618 --> 01:29:46,990
- Yeah. They're all wet.
- And the punch?

948
01:29:47,079 --> 01:29:51,242
- Yeah.
- Get the sandwiches. Uh-oh.

949
01:29:52,584 --> 01:29:54,577
I'll put 'em down.

950
01:29:54,670 --> 01:29:57,790
Can I talk to you, please?

951
01:29:57,881 --> 01:30:00,419
Opal, you worked real hard.

952
01:30:00,509 --> 01:30:04,127
I brought this for you.
I figured you'd earned it.

953
01:30:04,221 --> 01:30:08,266
- Thanks, Otis.
- Dog. Dog. Dog.

954
01:30:09,518 --> 01:30:13,017
Don't worry. I got the dog pictures.
I got 'em right here.

955
01:30:13,105 --> 01:30:16,390
Winn-Dixie. Winn-Dixie.

956
01:30:16,483 --> 01:30:18,606
Oh, no.

957
01:30:18,694 --> 01:30:21,648
Winn-Dixie, he's scared of thunder.

958
01:30:22,614 --> 01:30:25,022
No, Winn-Dixie! No!

959
01:30:25,117 --> 01:30:29,031
Opal, no. He's probably outside under a chair.

960
01:30:29,121 --> 01:30:32,205
- Take the flashlight and go and look. Opal.
- No! No!

961
01:30:32,291 --> 01:30:35,707
Opal, take the flashlight.

962
01:30:35,794 --> 01:30:38,795
Opal! Opal!

963
01:30:40,257 --> 01:30:43,009
Winn-Dixie!

964
01:30:43,093 --> 01:30:46,593
- You can't see!
- Come back!

965
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:49,598
Opal! Opal!

966
01:30:52,853 --> 01:30:55,854
Dewberry boys. Got all wet.

967
01:30:55,939 --> 01:30:57,102
Opal!

968
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:02,066
Winn-Dixie!

969
01:31:02,154 --> 01:31:05,321
Opal, your guests are here!

970
01:31:06,742 --> 01:31:11,036
- Opal! Your guests are here.
- I don't care!

971
01:31:11,121 --> 01:31:14,573
Now, you come up here right this minute.
Come right up here.

972
01:31:16,293 --> 01:31:19,377
Now, let me tell you something.
This is your party.

973
01:31:19,463 --> 01:31:22,879
And I want you to tell these boys
how glad you are that they came.

974
01:31:22,966 --> 01:31:25,208
Thank you for coming to my party.

975
01:31:25,302 --> 01:31:29,430
- It's just I gotta find Winn-Dixie.
- Do you want me to help?

976
01:31:29,515 --> 01:31:32,302
Listen. Opal.

977
01:31:32,392 --> 01:31:38,265
You cannot hold onto anything that wants
to go. Do you understand what I'm saying?

978
01:31:38,357 --> 01:31:41,975
You just got to love it
while you got it, and that's that.

979
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:46,938
- I've just got to find him!
- Opal! Wait till the rain stops!

980
01:31:47,032 --> 01:31:48,776
Opal!

981
01:31:49,410 --> 01:31:51,319
Opal!

982
01:31:53,872 --> 01:31:55,948
Winn-Dixie!

983
01:31:57,209 --> 01:31:59,285
Winn-Dixie!

984
01:32:06,051 --> 01:32:07,593
- Is he here?
- Who?

985
01:32:07,678 --> 01:32:12,803
Winn-Dixie. He's gone. He ran away
because of the storm, and I can't find him.

986
01:32:12,891 --> 01:32:15,347
Come on in out of the rain, Opal.

987
01:32:15,436 --> 01:32:20,014
We were at the party
and you were supposed to be there.

988
01:32:22,693 --> 01:32:25,729
- And you weren't. And now he's gone.
- Opal.

989
01:32:25,821 --> 01:32:27,196
Opal...

990
01:32:27,698 --> 01:32:30,236
Opal!

991
01:32:30,325 --> 01:32:33,529
Come back here! Opal.

992
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:37,570
Here, take your raincoat.
We'll look for him together.

993
01:32:42,588 --> 01:32:46,170
- Winn-Dixie!
- Winn-Dixie?

994
01:32:47,217 --> 01:32:52,175
I'll write a list of ten things about him.
That way people'll know him if they see him.

995
01:32:52,264 --> 01:32:54,720
We'll find him, Opal.

996
01:32:55,768 --> 01:33:00,264
One, he has a pathological fear
of thunderstorms.

997
01:33:00,355 --> 01:33:04,436
Two, he likes to smile at everyone he meets.

998
01:33:04,526 --> 01:33:07,480
Three, he likes going to church.

999
01:33:08,530 --> 01:33:11,567
<i>Four, he snores.</i>

1000
01:33:12,201 --> 01:33:16,827
<i>Five, he can catch mice</i>
<i>without squishing them to death.</i>

1001
01:33:17,915 --> 01:33:22,327
<i>Number six... number six</i>
<i>is he likes to meet people.</i>

1002
01:33:23,962 --> 01:33:28,043
<i>Number seven,</i>
<i>he sure does like peanut butter.</i>

1003
01:33:32,012 --> 01:33:36,591
<i>Number eight, he can't stand to be left alone.</i>

1004
01:33:36,683 --> 01:33:41,013
<i>Nine, he likes to sit on couches</i>
<i>and sleep in beds.</i>

1005
01:33:42,064 --> 01:33:47,307
<i>Number ten is... he was a dog</i>
<i>who knew how to be a friend.</i>

1006
01:33:47,945 --> 01:33:51,859
<i>I kept on going over and over</i>
<i>that list in my head,</i>

1007
01:33:51,949 --> 01:33:55,400
<i>the same way I did with the list</i>
<i>of ten things about my mama.</i>

1008
01:33:55,494 --> 01:33:56,869
Winn-Dixie!

1009
01:33:56,954 --> 01:34:00,998
<i>I memorized it so if I didn't find him,</i>

1010
01:34:01,083 --> 01:34:05,412
<i>I'd at least have some part of him</i>
<i>to hold onto.</i>

1011
01:34:14,555 --> 01:34:19,929
It's getting late, Opal. You're getting tired.
We need to head back.

1012
01:34:19,977 --> 01:34:23,061
But, Daddy, he's out there.
We can't leave him.

1013
01:34:23,147 --> 01:34:26,681
There's only so much looking we can do.

1014
01:34:31,822 --> 01:34:34,194
- You're gonna give up.
- Opal.

1015
01:34:34,283 --> 01:34:36,571
You give up on everything.

1016
01:34:36,660 --> 01:34:41,121
- That's not true.
- It is true. All you do is give up.

1017
01:34:41,206 --> 01:34:45,584
Just pull your head back inside
your stupid turtle shell and give up.

1018
01:34:45,669 --> 01:34:49,916
You won't talk. You won't go to parties.

1019
01:34:51,759 --> 01:34:56,670
And I bet you didn't even go out
looking for Mama when she left.

1020
01:34:57,723 --> 01:35:02,052
- I bet you just let her run off too.
- I couldn't stop her. I tried.

1021
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:06,722
No, I tried. You don't think I wanted
her to stay too? She was everything to me.

1022
01:35:06,815 --> 01:35:09,602
You didn't try. She wasn't everything to you.

1023
01:35:09,693 --> 01:35:13,276
Yes, she was.
Opal, she was everything- everything!

1024
01:35:13,363 --> 01:35:16,649
I failed her, all right? I failed her.

1025
01:35:16,742 --> 01:35:22,365
- I failed her, Opal. I tried and I tried...
- You didn't try. I know you didn't.

1026
01:35:22,456 --> 01:35:26,584
I did. I tried and I tried and I tried.

1027
01:35:26,668 --> 01:35:28,875
With everything I had.

1028
01:35:34,093 --> 01:35:36,215
It's my fault.

1029
01:35:36,303 --> 01:35:39,221
Opal, it's all my fault.

1030
01:35:41,809 --> 01:35:44,181
I'm sorry.

1031
01:35:49,983 --> 01:35:52,190
Daddy.

1032
01:35:53,237 --> 01:35:58,860
And don't believe losing Winn-Dixie isn't
gonna upset me as much as it does you.

1033
01:35:58,951 --> 01:36:02,818
I love that dog. I love him too.

1034
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:11,957
I love you, Daddy.

1035
01:36:14,341 --> 01:36:16,500
I love you too.

1036
01:36:31,233 --> 01:36:33,391
Daddy?

1037
01:36:33,485 --> 01:36:38,112
- Do you think Mama will ever come back?
- No. No, I don't, Opal.

1038
01:36:38,198 --> 01:36:42,492
I've hoped, prayed and dreamed about her
coming back. I don't think it'll happen.

1039
01:36:42,578 --> 01:36:46,278
Gloria told me
that you can't hold onto anybody.

1040
01:36:46,373 --> 01:36:49,540
That you can only love
what you got while you've got it.

1041
01:36:51,670 --> 01:36:54,671
Gloria Dump is a wise person.

1042
01:36:57,342 --> 01:36:59,964
But I'm not ready to let Winn-Dixie go.

1043
01:37:00,053 --> 01:37:02,461
Well, we'll keep on looking.

1044
01:37:02,556 --> 01:37:08,677
Opal, remember when I told you your mama
took everything with her when she left?

1045
01:37:08,771 --> 01:37:09,933
Yes, sir.

1046
01:37:10,022 --> 01:37:13,854
Well, there's one very important thing
she left behind.

1047
01:37:13,942 --> 01:37:16,860
- What?
- You.

1048
01:37:18,739 --> 01:37:21,277
Thank God your mama left me you.

1049
01:37:33,170 --> 01:37:35,376
- Did you find him?
- No.

1050
01:37:35,464 --> 01:37:38,797
Not yet. We haven't found him yet.

1051
01:37:40,052 --> 01:37:43,966
- We went looking too.
- We drove all over.

1052
01:37:44,056 --> 01:37:47,306
I'm sorry, Opal. We just drove all over town.

1053
01:37:47,392 --> 01:37:50,429
I had a dog once
that wandered all over the place.

1054
01:37:50,521 --> 01:37:51,896
And?

1055
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:55,848
And, when he got through wandering...

1056
01:37:55,943 --> 01:37:57,816
he came home.

1057
01:37:57,903 --> 01:38:02,364
Don't worry, Opal.
He'll come back. He's got to.

1058
01:38:03,450 --> 01:38:06,700
- Preacher?
- Mm-hm?

1059
01:38:06,787 --> 01:38:10,037
You're blessed with this one.

1060
01:38:33,355 --> 01:38:35,727
Is she praying?

1061
01:38:37,901 --> 01:38:43,856
- Are you praying?
- No, I'm not praying. I'm just thinking.

1062
01:38:43,949 --> 01:38:47,816
- What about?
- A lot of different things.

1063
01:38:48,662 --> 01:38:52,991
I'm sorry I called you guys
baldheaded babies.

1064
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:58,837
- You want to come back inside?
- I guess so.

1065
01:39:16,106 --> 01:39:20,056
- I'll race you to the angel by the porch.
- Go!

1066
01:39:23,864 --> 01:39:26,651
- Otis, you know any hymns?
- Yeah, I know some.

1067
01:39:26,742 --> 01:39:27,821
Yeah?

1068
01:39:27,910 --> 01:39:31,742
- You hum it, Daddy. I know he can play it.
- Oh. All right.

1069
01:39:55,854 --> 01:39:58,143
Winn-Dixie!

1070
01:40:00,234 --> 01:40:04,148
Oh, Winn-Dixie! How'd you get back here?

1071
01:40:04,238 --> 01:40:07,737
Where've you been, you dumb dog?

1072
01:40:13,163 --> 01:40:19,996
Well? Are we having a party,
or are we having a party?

1073
01:40:20,087 --> 01:40:24,037
We're having a party,
and the theme is this dog.

1074
01:40:24,133 --> 01:40:28,000
- All right!
- It is lovely, it is beautiful.

1075
01:41:37,539 --> 01:41:40,161
<i>My heart doesn't feel so empty any more.</i>

1076
01:41:40,250 --> 01:41:42,824
<i>It's full, all the way up.</i>

1077
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:46,004
<i>I've got Winn-Dixie, I've got Gloria Dump,</i>

1078
01:41:46,090 --> 01:41:48,663
<i>and Miss Franny Block, and Otis,</i>

1079
01:41:48,759 --> 01:41:50,882
<i>and even the Dewberry boys.</i>

1080
01:41:50,969 --> 01:41:54,635
<i>And I also have the preacher back</i>
<i>as my daddy.</i>

1081
01:41:54,723 --> 01:41:57,261
<i>It was a good story, right?</i>

1082
01:41:57,351 --> 01:42:00,969
<i>And it's all because of... well, you know.</i>

1083
01:42:06,527 --> 01:42:10,690
Glory, hallelujah! Hallelujah!
