1
00:00:41,412 --> 00:00:43,470
What are you doing?

2
00:00:45,317 --> 00:00:49,222
Get back in the fucking vehicle, Mike!

3
00:00:50,222 --> 00:00:54,127
Mike, get back in the fucking vehicle.

4
00:00:57,963 --> 00:01:01,262
Let's go, Mike, now!

5
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:11,540
Dad?

6
00:01:14,513 --> 00:01:15,843
Daddy?

7
00:01:16,013 --> 00:01:18,400
I can hardly hear you.

8
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,323
I said your son has gone AWOL.

9
00:01:22,754 --> 00:01:24,712
My son's in Iraq.

10
00:01:25,123 --> 00:01:29,192
Your son was in Iraq, sir.
His unit arrived stateside four days ago.

11
00:01:29,194 --> 00:01:32,229
Soldier, if my son were back,
I'd sure as hell know it.

12
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,000
He has until Sunday to get back
or he'll be listed as absent.

13
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:39,304
I'm sorry, I have another call.

14
00:01:44,676 --> 00:01:47,270
You have no messages.

15
00:02:12,905 --> 00:02:17,707
Hey, this is Mike. Leave a message.
If I ever get a signal, I'll call you back.

16
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:26,250
Mike, it's your old man. Heard you're back.
Give me a call when you get a chance.

17
00:02:30,254 --> 00:02:36,026
Think about that. Freedom is on the march,
and we're safer because of it.

18
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:38,396
Iraq is still dangerous.

19
00:02:38,396 --> 00:02:43,167
It is dangerous because that society
is becoming more free...

20
00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:45,069
... and heading toward democracy.

21
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:48,072
Analysts say a broader strategy
is at work...

22
00:02:48,073 --> 00:02:52,109
... one that began with the offensive
in the Sunni Triangle city of Samarra...

23
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,441
... earlier this month.

24
00:02:56,981 --> 00:02:58,745
There you go.

25
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:02,385
You sure that thing's gonna fit?

26
00:03:02,387 --> 00:03:06,479
You gotta trust somebody
sometime, Hank.

27
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:20,401
- Anyone call?
- Nope.

28
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,115
Fort Rudd, how may I direct your call?

29
00:03:31,115 --> 00:03:35,752
First Sergeant Arnold Bickman,
Criminal Investigations Division.

30
00:03:35,753 --> 00:03:39,557
I'm sorry, sir. I have no one
by that name on base.

31
00:03:39,557 --> 00:03:41,150
Thank you.

32
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:50,615
Anything you wanna tell me?

33
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:07,884
Why can't I go with you?

34
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:09,586
If he's someplace celebrating...

35
00:04:09,587 --> 00:04:12,490
...last thing he needs is his mother
walking in on him.

36
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:16,526
- I'll call you when I get there tomorrow.
- It's a two-day drive.

37
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:18,257
For some people.

38
00:04:55,968 --> 00:04:58,034
You don't wanna let it touch the ground.

39
00:04:58,036 --> 00:04:59,560
Okay.

40
00:05:01,572 --> 00:05:04,906
- Where you from?
- El Salvador.

41
00:05:05,142 --> 00:05:08,713
Do you know what it means
when a flag flies upside down?

42
00:05:08,713 --> 00:05:11,882
- No.
- It's an international distress signal.

43
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:14,151
- No shit?
- No shit.

44
00:05:14,151 --> 00:05:17,053
It means we're in a lot of trouble,
so come save our ass...

45
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:20,124
...because we don't have a prayer in hell
of saving ourselves.

46
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,660
- It says a lot.
- Yes, it does.

47
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:24,161
You know how to do it now?

48
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:26,425
- Oh, yes.
- Good.

49
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:37,240
This whole concept of "Vote or Die!"
To me the question is:

50
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:39,175
Are they gonna vote?

51
00:05:39,177 --> 00:05:43,581
Are they gonna leave the bong
long enough to actually vote?

52
00:05:43,581 --> 00:05:45,447
I don't know.

53
00:05:53,257 --> 00:05:54,781
Dad?

54
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,028
Daddy?

55
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:00,225
Dad?

56
00:06:14,612 --> 00:06:16,637
Dad?

57
00:06:22,187 --> 00:06:24,018
Dad?

58
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:07,298
A strong low-pressure system will pass
southward across New Mexico tonight...

59
00:07:07,298 --> 00:07:11,000
... bringing with it colder temperatures
and overcast skies.

60
00:07:11,002 --> 00:07:12,992
Go ahead, sergeant.

61
00:07:15,774 --> 00:07:17,660
Thank you, ma'am.

62
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:25,564
Sergeant Deerfield?

63
00:07:28,452 --> 00:07:30,454
- Hi.
- Thanks. I know you're busy.

64
00:07:30,454 --> 00:07:34,091
I wish you told me you were coming.
I could've made a little more time.

65
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:36,393
Bet the base has changed a lot
since your day.

66
00:07:36,394 --> 00:07:37,827
- Thanks, corporal.
- Welcome.

67
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:39,362
What about his buddies?

68
00:07:39,363 --> 00:07:41,507
We asked, of course.

69
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:44,802
The rest of my guys
just got back from a 72.

70
00:07:44,802 --> 00:07:47,137
I don't wanna seem like
I'm not concerned.

71
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:50,841
Where they been, it's a miracle
more guys don't blow off for a few days.

72
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:54,879
Would you mind if I had a look
at his quarters?

73
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,903
No.

74
00:08:02,086 --> 00:08:04,589
- Penning.
- Yes, sarge.

75
00:08:04,622 --> 00:08:07,625
- This is Specialist Deerfield's father.
- Good to meet you.

76
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,225
- Have you heard from Mike?
- No.

77
00:08:09,226 --> 00:08:11,228
He wants to look at his son's quarters.

78
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:14,165
Certainly, sir. Shortcut's through here.

79
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:16,399
Me and Mike go back to Bosnia.

80
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:20,771
He's sure told me
enough stories about you.

81
00:08:20,771 --> 00:08:23,940
- He hasn't called or anything?
- Does that surprise you?

82
00:08:23,942 --> 00:08:27,343
You know better than me,
but I recall Mike showing up for roll call...

83
00:08:27,345 --> 00:08:29,646
...with a collarbone
sticking through his skin.

84
00:08:29,648 --> 00:08:33,017
Long, Ortiez. This is Doc's dad.

85
00:08:33,018 --> 00:08:36,854
- Oh, honored to meet you, sir.
- Good to meet you.

86
00:08:36,855 --> 00:08:37,879
Doc?

87
00:08:38,056 --> 00:08:40,758
A nickname we gave him.
Made no sense.

88
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:43,059
That's Mike's room there.

89
00:08:43,061 --> 00:08:45,296
You boys have any idea
where Mike could be?

90
00:08:45,297 --> 00:08:46,963
- No, sir.
- Sorry.

91
00:08:46,965 --> 00:08:49,600
- Must be one hell of a woman.
- Yeah.

92
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,302
Good to meet you, sir.

93
00:08:51,302 --> 00:08:58,614
When you hear from Mike, you tell him
to get his butt back here, okay?

94
00:09:01,446 --> 00:09:03,004
Sergeant?

95
00:09:03,715 --> 00:09:06,951
This is Specialist Deerfield's dad.
We've come to look at his bunk.

96
00:09:06,951 --> 00:09:12,590
Roger. I thought you were
someone trying to steal shit.

97
00:09:12,591 --> 00:09:14,225
Is that your room?

98
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:17,528
Yeah. That's Mike's bunk there.

99
00:09:19,998 --> 00:09:23,129
It was nice to meet you, sir.

100
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,628
Who's that?

101
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:28,866
We lost a man.

102
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:45,755
That's your duffel, right?

103
00:09:45,756 --> 00:09:47,190
Yep.

104
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:55,828
Tried to convince him to take the one
he was issued. It's like talking to a wall.

105
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,543
No photographs.

106
00:10:07,544 --> 00:10:08,909
Sorry?

107
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,914
Mike's always taking pictures
and e-mailing them to me...

108
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,418
...and I don't see any photographs...

109
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:16,062
...or a camera.

110
00:10:16,888 --> 00:10:20,292
Property theft is a real problem.

111
00:10:21,326 --> 00:10:26,363
- Guess it was the same during your stint.
- Yeah.

112
00:10:26,364 --> 00:10:31,567
You mind if I take this? His mother
gave it to him and I left mine at home.

113
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:35,739
I'd like to, but I can't
let you remove anything.

114
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,331
I understand.

115
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:38,868
Okay.

116
00:10:42,681 --> 00:10:46,250
I think New Mexico is a very important
state, and I want to win New Mexico.

117
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:50,386
I think New Mexico has great
possibilities of better jobs...

118
00:10:50,388 --> 00:10:54,591
... more jobs.
You've got those wonderful...

119
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,327
This phone's been around
some intense heat.

120
00:10:57,328 --> 00:11:01,634
- It's been in Iraq.
- That could do it.

121
00:11:02,232 --> 00:11:03,927
All right.

122
00:11:07,272 --> 00:11:09,759
This is seriously fried.

123
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,769
Let's see. Okay.

124
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:15,572
Address book.

125
00:11:15,746 --> 00:11:19,316
All right, there's numbers for barracks,
burgers, chicken, Mom...

126
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:21,615
...pizza, TD's, Ted.

127
00:11:21,786 --> 00:11:23,086
What's TD's?

128
00:11:23,087 --> 00:11:26,690
That's a local joint. Could've been more,
but that's all that's left.

129
00:11:26,691 --> 00:11:31,195
- Okay, thanks. How much?
- You want the media?

130
00:11:31,196 --> 00:11:32,355
Media?

131
00:11:32,764 --> 00:11:34,163
Yeah. Look.

132
00:11:39,937 --> 00:11:41,404
Speed up!

133
00:11:42,307 --> 00:11:44,571
No. This is trash.

134
00:11:48,312 --> 00:11:50,614
Oh, yeah, here we go.

135
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,953
Bonner, take this.

136
00:11:56,955 --> 00:11:59,099
Long, toss the ball!

137
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:02,658
Historical moment.

138
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:07,130
The first time one of these kids is gonna
get to touch a real American football.

139
00:12:07,131 --> 00:12:10,692
- That's your son?
- That's Mike.

140
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:17,173
Yeah! No, you're going this way!
This way!

141
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:20,510
Hey, that's my ball, you little fuckers!

142
00:12:20,511 --> 00:12:23,379
Hey! Shit.

143
00:12:23,748 --> 00:12:25,078
Fuck.

144
00:12:26,116 --> 00:12:27,817
What's wrong, man?

145
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:31,754
- Did Ali Baba take your football?
- Turn off the fucking phone.

146
00:12:31,755 --> 00:12:32,812
Any more?

147
00:12:32,956 --> 00:12:36,025
Yeah, but it looks like the rest
of the files are corrupted.

148
00:12:36,027 --> 00:12:39,663
If you want, I have a program at home
that can pull them off.

149
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:42,832
It's slow, but I could charge you
a hundred flat.

150
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:46,903
- Can you e-mail them to me?
- Yeah, no problem.

151
00:12:46,904 --> 00:12:49,635
- Thanks.
- Where's TD's?

152
00:12:56,614 --> 00:12:59,158
I'm looking for my boy.

153
00:13:44,028 --> 00:13:46,572
I'm looking for my son.

154
00:13:46,764 --> 00:13:48,230
Good luck.

155
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,129
I need four tequila shots! Four!

156
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,337
What are you doing?

157
00:14:37,414 --> 00:14:40,616
Just looking at some old photos
Mike sent me.

158
00:14:40,618 --> 00:14:42,745
You gonna be okay?

159
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:50,760
It doesn't make sense.
He wouldn't leave without telling us.

160
00:14:50,761 --> 00:14:52,821
I will find him.

161
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:56,032
Okay.

162
00:14:58,135 --> 00:14:59,763
Night.

163
00:14:59,937 --> 00:15:01,599
Good night.

164
00:15:33,971 --> 00:15:36,359
I can hardly hear you.

165
00:15:36,807 --> 00:15:39,938
You gotta get me out of here.

166
00:16:04,034 --> 00:16:07,236
Well, she should've known better.

167
00:16:07,238 --> 00:16:09,034
Hold a sec.

168
00:16:11,808 --> 00:16:13,744
- Your son is in the Army.
- Yes, ma'am.

169
00:16:13,745 --> 00:16:15,979
Then you need to see the military police.

170
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,249
They're busy with the war.
I'm trying to check things out.

171
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,884
- You can file a missing person's report.
- Fine.

172
00:16:21,885 --> 00:16:26,222
In which case, you'll need to see
the military police.

173
00:16:26,224 --> 00:16:33,793
How about you let me talk to somebody
that does more than answer a phone?

174
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:41,437
Sir, I wondered if you could
help me with this...

175
00:16:41,438 --> 00:16:44,573
I don't think you understand.
He loved that dog.

176
00:16:44,575 --> 00:16:47,443
I'm sure he did, ma'am,
but the dog bit him.

177
00:16:47,445 --> 00:16:50,413
- When a dog bites you, what do you do?
- I really don't know.

178
00:16:50,414 --> 00:16:53,450
You tie it up, you give it away,
you might even shoot it.

179
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:56,753
You don't pick it up by the throat,
wrestle it into the bathroom...

180
00:16:56,754 --> 00:16:59,088
...and drown it in the tub.

181
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:03,592
That doesn't sound
a little bit strange to you?

182
00:17:03,594 --> 00:17:05,628
Maybe he thought it was more humane.

183
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,432
More humane? It's a Doberman.

184
00:17:08,432 --> 00:17:11,634
He's drowning it right in front of our son
and it's biting him.

185
00:17:11,635 --> 00:17:16,640
And I'm crying for him to stop.
That all sounds humane to you?

186
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:18,875
Your husband ever threaten you
or your child?

187
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,943
He'd never hurt us. He just needs help.

188
00:17:20,944 --> 00:17:22,913
That's why you need to go to the VA.

189
00:17:22,913 --> 00:17:25,882
You need to go to them
and ask them about counseling.

190
00:17:25,883 --> 00:17:28,250
You think I haven't been down there?

191
00:17:28,251 --> 00:17:31,587
He won't go. He's gonna hurt himself.
I know he is.

192
00:17:31,588 --> 00:17:34,257
- Look, I'd really like to help you here.
- Really?

193
00:17:34,258 --> 00:17:37,426
Oh, because it looks to me
like you don't give a crap.

194
00:17:37,427 --> 00:17:39,195
You know, in fact, I do.

195
00:17:39,197 --> 00:17:42,965
But I gotta tell you, crimes against dogs
are particularly hard to prosecute.

196
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:45,469
If you don't mind,
I have somebody waiting for me.

197
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,038
- Okay. Fuck you, lady.
- Okay.

198
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:49,063
Great.

199
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,511
That kind of morning, huh?

200
00:18:01,085 --> 00:18:03,220
You gotta take that to military police.

201
00:18:03,221 --> 00:18:07,990
I'm trying to keep my son
out of more trouble.

202
00:18:07,991 --> 00:18:09,558
I know you're busy...

203
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:12,863
...but I need you to make one phone call
to his bank and find out...

204
00:18:12,864 --> 00:18:16,232
...if he's made withdrawals or used
his credit card in the last week.

205
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:18,602
Retired cop, or just watch a lot of TV?

206
00:18:18,603 --> 00:18:20,136
Military police, retired.

207
00:18:20,137 --> 00:18:23,606
Then you should know. Army has
jurisdiction over its own personnel.

208
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:25,275
Sorry, I hope you find your son.

209
00:18:25,276 --> 00:18:29,145
I don't know what you think your job is,
but if it's anything like mine was...

210
00:18:29,146 --> 00:18:32,883
...it's to roll up drunks, twiddle your
thumbs, not ask too many questions.

211
00:18:32,884 --> 00:18:36,586
But my son has spent the last 18 months
bringing democracy to a shithole...

212
00:18:36,586 --> 00:18:38,221
...and serving his country.

213
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:41,211
He deserves better than this.

214
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:56,354
Because we have done the hard work,
we are entering a season of hope.

215
00:18:56,773 --> 00:19:01,611
My God. Hank Deerfield.
I'll be a son of a bitch.

216
00:19:01,612 --> 00:19:04,780
- What the hell you doing at home?
- Well, you almost missed us.

217
00:19:04,781 --> 00:19:07,217
We're taking the camper
to see the grandkids.

218
00:19:07,218 --> 00:19:10,086
- I called you at the base.
- Base?

219
00:19:10,086 --> 00:19:13,957
Well, Christ, Hank.
I've been retired for 14 years.

220
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:17,294
- You have not.
- Yeah, going on 15.

221
00:19:17,295 --> 00:19:19,429
How in the hell are you?

222
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,132
Fine. Oh, want coffee or a piece of pie?

223
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:26,403
No, no, I don't have time.
Helen's waiting in the camper.

224
00:19:26,403 --> 00:19:27,903
What'd you do...

225
00:19:27,904 --> 00:19:30,640
...bust an axle and call me for a tow?

226
00:19:30,641 --> 00:19:35,345
No, I was hoping you were still at CID.
I'm looking for a friendly face.

227
00:19:35,346 --> 00:19:39,281
- Neither one of your boys in trouble, I hope.
- No.

228
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:42,451
- What was that oldest one's name, Darren?
- David.

229
00:19:42,452 --> 00:19:45,888
David, that's right.
Joined 82nd Airborne, didn't he?

230
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,490
- Yeah.
- Yeah, tough bunch of sons of bitches.

231
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:50,621
How's he liking it?

232
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:56,132
He died in a helicopter crash
on maneuvers at Fort Bragg 10 years ago.

233
00:19:56,133 --> 00:20:00,002
Oh, God, I'm sorry to hear that, Hank.

234
00:20:00,003 --> 00:20:01,971
Very sorry.

235
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,840
How about the younger one?

236
00:20:04,842 --> 00:20:06,673
- Mike.
- Yeah.

237
00:20:06,844 --> 00:20:10,881
Regular Army, just like his old man.
In Iraq, doing well.

238
00:20:10,882 --> 00:20:15,451
I'm doing a favor for a neighbor lady.
One of her boys is in a little trouble.

239
00:20:15,452 --> 00:20:18,721
Is there anybody we know still there?

240
00:20:18,722 --> 00:20:21,439
No, no. They're all gone.

241
00:20:25,563 --> 00:20:28,230
She got you on a short leash.

242
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:29,875
Well, you know.

243
00:20:30,701 --> 00:20:33,259
Kids are waiting for us.

244
00:21:15,613 --> 00:21:17,948
I found his old checkbook.

245
00:21:17,949 --> 00:21:22,451
Is there anything written on it?
I need a password.

246
00:21:22,452 --> 00:21:24,820
No, there's nothing on it.

247
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:25,877
You sure?

248
00:21:26,423 --> 00:21:33,790
Which do you think it is,
I'm blind or I don't feel like telling you?

249
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:43,038
I'm worried, Hank. I'm truly worried.

250
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,072
He's a good boy. He'll have a reason.

251
00:21:48,546 --> 00:21:49,569
Hank?

252
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,085
I'll find him. Talk to you tomorrow.

253
00:22:23,314 --> 00:22:24,580
What's going on?

254
00:22:24,582 --> 00:22:28,317
Don't you worry, it's not animal-related.

255
00:22:28,318 --> 00:22:29,479
What?

256
00:22:29,653 --> 00:22:32,521
They found body parts
out on Mesa Luna Road.

257
00:22:32,522 --> 00:22:35,497
- I'll get the car.
- Okay.

258
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:43,233
Hey, Bonner. There's your family.

259
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:45,535
Stop fucking around.

260
00:22:45,536 --> 00:22:48,971
- You could've fucking broken it!
- You're a fucking idiot.

261
00:22:48,972 --> 00:22:50,098
Oh, fuck.

262
00:22:50,273 --> 00:22:52,142
Oh, shit! What do I do?

263
00:22:52,143 --> 00:22:54,309
Do not stop. Do not fucking stop!

264
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,557
- Speed up! Speed up!
- Bonner!

265
00:23:07,691 --> 00:23:10,766
- Fuck.
- What are you doing?

266
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:22,036
Maybe go down there a little bit further.

267
00:23:23,173 --> 00:23:26,509
Aaron, I need more evidence markers.

268
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:28,724
You got all we have.

269
00:23:28,846 --> 00:23:33,650
Straighten out some wire hangers, and buy
Dixie cups to stick on the ends of them.

270
00:23:33,651 --> 00:23:35,448
Come on.

271
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,520
And get me a receipt.

272
00:23:49,834 --> 00:23:51,199
Sean?

273
00:24:03,346 --> 00:24:05,076
Thanks.

274
00:24:40,817 --> 00:24:43,462
Tell me good news, Hodge.

275
00:24:45,288 --> 00:24:49,826
Well, it looks like the victim
was killed by that fire site there...

276
00:24:49,826 --> 00:24:53,630
...then the body was chopped up,
it was burned...

277
00:24:53,631 --> 00:24:56,732
...and animals scattered the parts, so...

278
00:24:56,733 --> 00:24:59,469
And you're smiling
like an idiot because...?

279
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:03,506
Well, the base bought this field
from the city two months ago.

280
00:25:03,507 --> 00:25:08,411
City property only extends 50 feet
from the center line of the road...

281
00:25:08,412 --> 00:25:12,788
...so I don't think it's our body, chief.

282
00:25:13,983 --> 00:25:16,076
Well, hallelujah.

283
00:25:16,252 --> 00:25:17,881
Let's go home.

284
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,324
Wrap it up, fellas!

285
00:25:21,325 --> 00:25:25,730
Boys with the shiny buttons
are coming in.

286
00:26:09,173 --> 00:26:12,040
It will necessarily break
the back of the insurgency.

287
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:13,710
It is not, though, the panacea.

288
00:26:13,711 --> 00:26:17,547
Just by taking it out does not mean
the rest of the insurgency will fall.

289
00:26:17,548 --> 00:26:20,549
More than half of Fallujah's
250,000 residents...

290
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,586
... have already fled
in anticipation of the offensive.

291
00:26:23,586 --> 00:26:29,659
Insurgents believed to number in the
thousands have been preparing defenses...

292
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:34,839
... attacking U.S. Troops,
and rigging booby traps.

293
00:26:44,275 --> 00:26:45,902
Mr. Deerfield?

294
00:26:47,076 --> 00:26:50,876
Jim Osher. Could I get a word?

295
00:26:51,048 --> 00:26:55,337
Yeah, come on in. I'll just be a minute.

296
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:37,125
Sir, I regret to inform you
that a body was found last night.

297
00:27:37,126 --> 00:27:42,898
Upon investigation, we believe it to be
the remains of your son, Michael Deerfield.

298
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,501
Right. They'll need me
to identify the body?

299
00:27:46,502 --> 00:27:48,388
No, sir. We've...

300
00:27:48,404 --> 00:27:52,008
They've determined identity in other ways.
I believe partial fingerprints.

301
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:54,676
What do you mean "partial"?
What happened to him?

302
00:27:54,677 --> 00:28:02,161
- I'm not at liberty to say, sir. Someone...
- I wanna see his body now!

303
00:28:24,173 --> 00:28:27,676
Sergeant Deerfield, this isn't necessary.

304
00:28:27,678 --> 00:28:29,778
It's not how you wanna
remember your son.

305
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:31,269
Maybe not...

306
00:28:31,815 --> 00:28:39,925
...but it's the way he left this earth,
so I don't see as I have any choice.

307
00:28:45,128 --> 00:28:47,663
Working backwards,
carbon patterns show the body...

308
00:28:47,663 --> 00:28:49,731
...was dismembered
before it was burned.

309
00:28:49,732 --> 00:28:53,301
It appears a large knife or tool
was used, but the blade was dull...

310
00:28:53,302 --> 00:28:56,471
...which is why the bones are
shattered rather than severed.

311
00:28:56,472 --> 00:28:59,375
Burn patterns show us
the dismembered parts were stacked...

312
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:03,011
...and doused with an accelerant in
an attempt to incinerate the body.

313
00:29:03,012 --> 00:29:06,348
You'd need an oven
to approach an effective temperature...

314
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:09,184
...which means most tissue
would've been left intact.

315
00:29:09,185 --> 00:29:12,721
So the damage is largely the result
of scavengers stripping the bones.

316
00:29:12,722 --> 00:29:15,324
Cause of death will take
more time to determine...

317
00:29:15,325 --> 00:29:17,527
...but there is evidence of stab wounds.

318
00:29:17,528 --> 00:29:18,688
How many?

319
00:29:19,363 --> 00:29:20,660
I'm sorry?

320
00:29:20,931 --> 00:29:24,666
- How many stab wounds?
- Well, with much of the flesh missing...

321
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:27,869
...we can only count blows
that made impact with bone.

322
00:29:27,871 --> 00:29:30,740
How many of those were there?

323
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,605
Forty-two.

324
00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:37,494
One knife, or several?

325
00:29:39,282 --> 00:29:40,750
One.

326
00:29:48,592 --> 00:29:52,028
- Gonna turn these over to the Army?
- Tried to.

327
00:29:52,028 --> 00:29:59,411
Said they took their own photos.
And they didn't say it in a nice way.

328
00:30:02,138 --> 00:30:05,074
I'd like to give you
a call tomorrow before you go home.

329
00:30:05,075 --> 00:30:06,808
I have a few questions.

330
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:08,606
Ask them now.

331
00:30:08,778 --> 00:30:12,048
- Your son didn't own a green car?
- Mike doesn't own a car.

332
00:30:12,048 --> 00:30:16,152
Motorist reported seeing a green sedan
parked on the shoulder near the field...

333
00:30:16,153 --> 00:30:17,953
...that Saturday night.

334
00:30:17,954 --> 00:30:22,157
One of the theories is that this is
a carjacking or a robbery gone wrong...

335
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,126
...and there's a big uptick
in gang activity lately.

336
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:27,762
I wanna see where he died.

337
00:30:27,763 --> 00:30:31,032
I'm sorry. It's an active crime scene,
but I will let you know...

338
00:30:31,034 --> 00:30:34,438
- ...as soon as you can.
- Okay.

339
00:30:35,305 --> 00:30:37,864
What else you wanna ask?

340
00:30:39,108 --> 00:30:41,877
A lot of the deaths like these
have been drug-related.

341
00:30:41,878 --> 00:30:45,347
Are you asking if Mike was
a drug dealer or just an addict?

342
00:30:45,348 --> 00:30:47,048
I don't wanna be asking anything.

343
00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:50,318
You know the Army
does regular drug tests.

344
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:53,036
Not when they're in Iraq.

345
00:30:54,857 --> 00:30:58,126
Now, we found this
under your son's mattress.

346
00:30:58,127 --> 00:31:00,328
It's not gonna go in my report.

347
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:02,832
But why I ask is last month...

348
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:07,103
...we arrested three soldiers who were
trying to smuggle heroin in from Kuwait.

349
00:31:07,104 --> 00:31:10,705
They'd made arrangements to sell it
to a local Mexican gang.

350
00:31:10,707 --> 00:31:12,974
I understand Mike spoke a little Spanish?

351
00:31:12,976 --> 00:31:17,012
And you think he could've been a drug mule
because he spoke Spanish?

352
00:31:17,013 --> 00:31:18,571
No...

353
00:31:18,781 --> 00:31:24,032
...because somebody cut off
his hands and his head.

354
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:07,148
I'm really sorry about your son.

355
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:10,993
Show me.

356
00:32:13,502 --> 00:32:15,299
I'm sorry?

357
00:32:17,673 --> 00:32:20,509
I need to see where he died.

358
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:22,603
It's not our case.

359
00:32:23,012 --> 00:32:25,080
The murder occurred on military property.

360
00:32:25,082 --> 00:32:27,516
- You know where it is?
- There's nothing to see.

361
00:32:27,517 --> 00:32:33,167
Then there shouldn't be any problem
with me seeing it.

362
00:32:39,429 --> 00:32:47,569
You people sure as hell know how to
trample a crime scene, I'll give you that.

363
00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:55,478
I suppose you thought
it was a good idea...

364
00:32:55,479 --> 00:33:01,230
...to have everybody you ever met
park on this shoulder.

365
00:33:03,653 --> 00:33:05,721
If your boys knew
what they were doing...

366
00:33:05,721 --> 00:33:09,557
...they'd have found traces of blood
in the gravel right here.

367
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:11,661
It's where he was killed.

368
00:33:11,662 --> 00:33:14,329
So you don't see blood,
but you know it's there?

369
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,388
Yeah.

370
00:33:15,932 --> 00:33:20,102
Just like I know his body
was dragged from here...

371
00:33:20,103 --> 00:33:21,626
...to there.

372
00:33:22,005 --> 00:33:24,064
That's remarkable.

373
00:33:24,407 --> 00:33:27,442
The ground is rock-hard,
but you see drag marks.

374
00:33:27,443 --> 00:33:33,115
You go to the trouble to burn a body,
don't you think you'd cover your tracks?

375
00:33:33,115 --> 00:33:35,917
I'm going to the restroom.

376
00:33:40,457 --> 00:33:43,224
You might find it easier
to drive around that field.

377
00:33:43,226 --> 00:33:46,615
You couldn't do any more damage.

378
00:33:52,836 --> 00:33:55,702
Everybody knows everything.

379
00:34:10,152 --> 00:34:11,949
- Hi.
- Hi.

380
00:34:12,121 --> 00:34:14,923
- Can I help you?
- I suppose the MPs have been in here...

381
00:34:14,925 --> 00:34:18,027
...asking questions about
what happened in that field.

382
00:34:18,027 --> 00:34:22,197
- They sure have. Terrible thing.
- I'm checking it out for the family.

383
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,266
Mind if I ask if you saw anything?

384
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:26,568
I wish we had.
We would've liked to help.

385
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:29,405
We didn't know what it was
when we smelled it, did we?

386
00:34:29,405 --> 00:34:31,474
- No.
- How's that?

387
00:34:31,474 --> 00:34:34,043
That Sunday,
when we drove in the parking lot...

388
00:34:34,043 --> 00:34:36,878
...we just thought somebody
had been barbecuing.

389
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,849
Smelled like burned meat.

390
00:34:42,251 --> 00:34:43,913
Thank you.

391
00:35:33,103 --> 00:35:36,871
Tell your MP friends they should be
looking for a blue car, not a green one.

392
00:35:36,873 --> 00:35:37,896
Why?

393
00:35:38,074 --> 00:35:41,976
Because a blue car under
a yellow light looks green.

394
00:35:41,978 --> 00:35:43,706
Doesn't it?

395
00:35:57,327 --> 00:35:59,260
It certainly does.

396
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,728
Thank you.

397
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:13,112
It's the least I could do.

398
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,139
I'd say that's accurate.

399
00:36:29,693 --> 00:36:32,322
I'll get a plane ticket.

400
00:36:32,362 --> 00:36:33,795
No.

401
00:36:35,331 --> 00:36:37,266
What do you mean, "No"?

402
00:36:37,266 --> 00:36:40,202
I'll bring him home soon as I can.

403
00:36:40,202 --> 00:36:44,606
I need to see him.
I need to be with Michael.

404
00:36:44,608 --> 00:36:46,438
He's gone.

405
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:49,344
I need to be with my boy.

406
00:36:49,346 --> 00:36:51,974
There is nothing left.

407
00:36:54,483 --> 00:36:57,543
What the hell does that mean?

408
00:36:58,688 --> 00:37:02,123
Joanie, for once in your life,
will you take my word for something?

409
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:04,753
For once? For once?

410
00:37:04,927 --> 00:37:07,563
I seem to remember
me being the one saying no...

411
00:37:07,563 --> 00:37:11,400
...and you saying it'd be good for his
character. Who won that argument, Hank?

412
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,070
Mike was the one who wanted to join.
I sure as hell didn't encourage it.

413
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:21,510
Living in this house, he never could've
felt like a man if he hadn't gone.

414
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:26,646
Both of my boys, Hank.
You could've left me one.

415
00:37:37,594 --> 00:37:39,117
Joanie?

416
00:37:43,065 --> 00:37:45,364
Joan, please.

417
00:37:54,945 --> 00:37:59,994
Joanie, I can't sit here
and listen to you cry.

418
00:38:02,351 --> 00:38:04,376
Well, then don't.

419
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:02,572
Door.

420
00:39:05,748 --> 00:39:07,340
Night.

421
00:39:08,451 --> 00:39:10,280
Night, sweetheart.

422
00:39:40,516 --> 00:39:41,813
Fuck!

423
00:39:48,157 --> 00:39:51,860
Another hallway left. Stacked, on me.
Ortiez, cover this door to the right.

424
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,463
To the right.
Penning, get this door with me. Long!

425
00:39:54,463 --> 00:39:56,130
- Roger!
- Covering!

426
00:39:56,132 --> 00:39:57,690
Got it.

427
00:39:57,967 --> 00:39:59,195
Go, go.

428
00:39:59,402 --> 00:40:01,905
- Clear. Clear.
- Clear.

429
00:40:02,739 --> 00:40:06,675
Give me a status on that door!
Better not fuck around with that phone!

430
00:40:06,675 --> 00:40:09,007
Absolutely not, Bonner!

431
00:40:09,646 --> 00:40:13,121
See how the clothes aren't burnt?

432
00:40:15,385 --> 00:40:17,858
It's really weird, Dad.

433
00:40:18,554 --> 00:40:24,534
- All right, all clear. Let's move it out!
- Move it out.

434
00:40:42,846 --> 00:40:43,869
Sure.

435
00:40:44,047 --> 00:40:46,378
Evie, chicken sandwich.

436
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:16,054
Mustard or mayonnaise?

437
00:41:17,045 --> 00:41:19,081
No, thank you, ma'am.

438
00:41:19,081 --> 00:41:22,150
A woman stands topless
in front of you...

439
00:41:22,152 --> 00:41:26,213
..."ma'am" could be taken as an insult.

440
00:41:26,588 --> 00:41:28,556
- This your son?
- Yes, ma'am.

441
00:41:28,557 --> 00:41:32,661
I'm asking if anybody saw him.
It would've been a week ago Saturday.

442
00:41:32,661 --> 00:41:38,313
I'm sorry. I don't recognize
anything but the uniform.

443
00:41:38,902 --> 00:41:41,375
Thank you, ma'am. Miss.

444
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:51,168
Right here.

445
00:42:10,465 --> 00:42:12,228
Stay here.

446
00:42:12,869 --> 00:42:14,936
Excuse me, lieutenant?

447
00:42:14,938 --> 00:42:18,106
I was just wondering how
I came to be assigned this case.

448
00:42:18,106 --> 00:42:19,335
Which case?

449
00:42:19,474 --> 00:42:21,210
Jacob Ronald Millard...

450
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:24,713
...slaughterhouse employee,
arrested for torturing chickens.

451
00:42:24,713 --> 00:42:26,981
It's no big deal. Everybody does it.

452
00:42:26,983 --> 00:42:29,284
Everybody doesn't poke
their eyes out, asshole.

453
00:42:29,284 --> 00:42:31,253
- Sure, they do.
- Shut up!

454
00:42:31,253 --> 00:42:34,556
Boss doesn't want me
humping his daughter.

455
00:42:34,556 --> 00:42:36,925
Now we're shocked beyond words.

456
00:42:36,925 --> 00:42:39,827
You see how you could draw
information out of people?

457
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:42,396
People just like you, Emily.

458
00:42:42,398 --> 00:42:47,168
That is how you got promoted from
traffic to detective squad, am I right?

459
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,431
I'm sorry?

460
00:42:48,605 --> 00:42:50,800
Oh, don't be.

461
00:42:50,974 --> 00:42:54,909
If Wayne or Hodge could've fucked their
way into the squad, they would've too.

462
00:42:54,911 --> 00:42:56,411
Well, Wayne would have.

463
00:42:56,411 --> 00:43:00,215
One of us needs to know
what we're doing.

464
00:43:00,215 --> 00:43:03,985
You see, that's what concerns me.
Having fucked my way into the job...

465
00:43:03,987 --> 00:43:08,757
...I may not be qualified enough to piece
together this complex of a crime.

466
00:43:08,757 --> 00:43:10,425
I mean, take that murder site.

467
00:43:10,425 --> 00:43:14,463
I would've never concluded that
that soldier was killed on Army property.

468
00:43:14,463 --> 00:43:18,099
I would've been fooled by the signs
of struggle on the side of the road.

469
00:43:18,101 --> 00:43:22,204
And you know that little trail of broken
brush from there to where he was burned?

470
00:43:22,204 --> 00:43:27,309
Well, that would've made me think he was
killed in our jurisdiction, and then moved.

471
00:43:27,309 --> 00:43:31,346
Because the killers didn't think it smart
to chop him up under a bright streetlight.

472
00:43:31,347 --> 00:43:36,512
Yeah. I would've totally
misread that crime scene.

473
00:43:41,724 --> 00:43:44,425
No, no, no. It's good work.

474
00:43:44,427 --> 00:43:46,862
I mean, we needed another homicide.

475
00:43:46,862 --> 00:43:50,398
What, we've solved three
out of the last 10?

476
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,235
Another unsolved would cement
my standing with the mayor.

477
00:43:53,235 --> 00:43:55,603
You have a problem with
your fellow detectives?

478
00:43:55,605 --> 00:43:58,172
- You feel the need to show them up?
- No, sir.

479
00:43:58,173 --> 00:44:00,409
So it's the military police?

480
00:44:00,409 --> 00:44:03,378
You think they're boobs,
they'll bungle the investigation?

481
00:44:03,378 --> 00:44:07,682
No, but let's not pretend we don't know the
real motives for the Army wanting this case.

482
00:44:07,684 --> 00:44:11,987
Psychic powers.
When did you discover you had these?

483
00:44:11,987 --> 00:44:16,257
You don't believe their primary concern will
be how this incident reflects on the Army?

484
00:44:16,259 --> 00:44:18,260
This is a career move? Is that it?

485
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,795
I don't have a career, sir. I have a job.

486
00:44:20,797 --> 00:44:22,998
I take care of my son
and do what I'm told.

487
00:44:22,998 --> 00:44:25,666
This boy died in a ditch
beside one of our streets.

488
00:44:25,668 --> 00:44:30,005
Someone burned him like a cord of wood,
leaving his remains for animals to chew on.

489
00:44:30,005 --> 00:44:32,807
With respect, if that was your son
just back from Iraq...

490
00:44:32,809 --> 00:44:36,010
...I don't think you'd be as happy
about tossing this case off...

491
00:44:36,012 --> 00:44:38,880
...so you look better come election time.

492
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,217
- That was with respect?
- That was my intent, sir.

493
00:44:42,217 --> 00:44:44,786
Fine. I'll think about it
and I'll let you know.

494
00:44:44,786 --> 00:44:46,722
Every second we lose in this...

495
00:44:46,722 --> 00:44:49,657
Didn't you say that you would do
whatever you were told?

496
00:44:49,659 --> 00:44:53,077
I sometimes exaggerate for effect.

497
00:44:56,898 --> 00:44:58,284
How's David?

498
00:44:59,034 --> 00:45:00,195
Sorry?

499
00:45:00,369 --> 00:45:02,065
Your son.

500
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,606
He's fine, thanks for asking.

501
00:45:05,608 --> 00:45:09,311
That deadbeat ex of yours ever
show up for any of his games?

502
00:45:09,311 --> 00:45:11,913
David's pretty pathetic
at every sport he attempts...

503
00:45:11,914 --> 00:45:14,682
...so he wants as few people
to witness it as possible.

504
00:45:14,684 --> 00:45:17,385
Well, that's a damn shame, isn't it?

505
00:45:17,387 --> 00:45:21,333
It's not like he's the boy's father.

506
00:45:23,992 --> 00:45:26,128
Anyway, way I see it...

507
00:45:26,128 --> 00:45:30,465
...it's the oddballs and the misfits who go
on to do interesting things with their lives.

508
00:45:30,465 --> 00:45:32,800
How many former
high school quarterbacks...

509
00:45:32,802 --> 00:45:36,070
...do we roll into the drunk tank
every Saturday night?

510
00:45:36,072 --> 00:45:38,672
Little misery in school is a good thing.

511
00:45:38,673 --> 00:45:43,110
You know, I was first-string quarterback
in my high school.

512
00:45:43,112 --> 00:45:48,762
I seem to recall you
showing me pictures of such, sir.

513
00:45:53,322 --> 00:45:56,557
You're gonna keep after me
about this Deerfield boy, aren't you?

514
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:02,108
I think you know what
the right thing to do is, sir.

515
00:46:02,864 --> 00:46:05,356
Jesus H. Christ.

516
00:46:07,269 --> 00:46:08,737
- Hilary.
- Yes, sir?

517
00:46:08,737 --> 00:46:13,989
- Get me Captain Fenderman at the base.
- Yes, sir.

518
00:46:55,083 --> 00:46:58,715
Would you like to sit down, ma'am?

519
00:47:00,989 --> 00:47:02,976
Is that everything?

520
00:47:04,726 --> 00:47:06,827
Is that all of him?

521
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:08,523
Yes, ma'am.

522
00:47:10,333 --> 00:47:13,835
- You must have to keep that room cold.
- Yes, ma'am.

523
00:47:13,835 --> 00:47:15,860
That looks cold.

524
00:47:20,342 --> 00:47:24,061
I wanna go inside. Can I go inside?

525
00:47:27,382 --> 00:47:29,755
No, ma'am. I'm sorry.

526
00:47:41,329 --> 00:47:44,318
My deepest sympathies, ma'am.

527
00:47:47,269 --> 00:47:50,643
You don't have a child, do you?

528
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,498
Do you?

529
00:49:23,798 --> 00:49:25,967
- Mr. Deerfield?
- Hi.

530
00:49:25,967 --> 00:49:28,536
I heard you ask if you
could have Mike's Bible...

531
00:49:28,536 --> 00:49:31,039
...and I thought it might
bring you some comfort.

532
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:32,706
Anybody know you took this?

533
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:37,978
No, sir. I asked the visitors' center
where you were staying and they told me.

534
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,713
Can I buy you a coffee?

535
00:49:39,715 --> 00:49:42,360
I really should get back.

536
00:49:43,686 --> 00:49:45,657
How about a drink?

537
00:50:26,061 --> 00:50:27,791
To Mike.

538
00:50:35,871 --> 00:50:41,177
I need to ask you something.
And I want the truth.

539
00:50:42,911 --> 00:50:44,778
Was Mike doing drugs?

540
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,873
Doc? I guess.

541
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:53,722
No more than the other guys.
He wasn't like a heavy doper or anything.

542
00:50:53,722 --> 00:50:57,659
You ever see him hanging out
off the base with anyone?

543
00:50:57,659 --> 00:50:59,389
Maybe Mexicans?

544
00:50:59,561 --> 00:51:01,257
No, sir.

545
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,201
How you adjusting?

546
00:51:06,402 --> 00:51:08,233
Being back?

547
00:51:09,472 --> 00:51:11,773
Hasn't been that long.

548
00:51:11,773 --> 00:51:13,675
Call your parents?

549
00:51:13,675 --> 00:51:17,378
My mom. My dad and I aren't close.

550
00:51:19,782 --> 00:51:23,271
- Did you guys talk much?
- Sure.

551
00:51:24,652 --> 00:51:27,211
We could've talked more.

552
00:51:31,293 --> 00:51:33,994
Did he ever say anything to you
that I should know?

553
00:51:33,996 --> 00:51:35,759
No, sir.

554
00:51:36,197 --> 00:51:38,028
I mean...

555
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:41,135
...you see shit over there
you don't wanna talk about...

556
00:51:41,137 --> 00:51:43,204
...even with your buddies.
- Yeah.

557
00:51:43,204 --> 00:51:45,172
But he did all right, Mike?

558
00:51:45,173 --> 00:51:48,233
He was a first-class soldier.

559
00:51:48,344 --> 00:51:51,346
You know Mike. He loved the Army.

560
00:51:51,347 --> 00:51:58,572
Couldn't wait to get there, save
the good guys and hurt the bad guys.

561
00:52:01,523 --> 00:52:05,960
They shouldn't send heroes
to places like Iraq.

562
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,949
Everything there's fucked up.

563
00:52:09,465 --> 00:52:15,429
Before I went, I'd never say this,
but you ask me now...

564
00:52:16,137 --> 00:52:22,704
...they should just nuke it
and watch it all turn back to dust.

565
00:52:25,681 --> 00:52:26,806
Hank?

566
00:52:28,083 --> 00:52:29,744
You okay?

567
00:52:29,918 --> 00:52:33,253
Yeah, I was just about to call you.

568
00:52:33,255 --> 00:52:36,157
A package came from Michael.

569
00:52:39,061 --> 00:52:41,028
What kind of package?

570
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:45,699
I don't know, it's a package.
He sent it to himself. It's from overseas.

571
00:52:45,701 --> 00:52:47,135
I'm gonna open it.

572
00:52:47,135 --> 00:52:48,262
No.

573
00:52:48,436 --> 00:52:50,909
What do you mean, "No"?

574
00:52:51,373 --> 00:52:55,677
Does it look like it's been opened
by customs or by the military?

575
00:52:55,677 --> 00:52:59,273
How would I know? No, it doesn't.

576
00:52:59,447 --> 00:53:00,782
Why can't I open it?

577
00:53:00,782 --> 00:53:02,250
Just don't.

578
00:53:02,418 --> 00:53:03,748
Please.

579
00:53:05,387 --> 00:53:08,204
Just put it someplace safe.

580
00:53:10,425 --> 00:53:12,121
Okay.

581
00:53:13,695 --> 00:53:16,027
- Night.
- Good night.

582
00:54:13,621 --> 00:54:15,795
- Morning.
- Morning.

583
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:18,992
I wonder if I could ask you
a few questions about your son.

584
00:54:18,994 --> 00:54:21,996
- I thought it wasn't your case.
- It sort of fell back to me.

585
00:54:21,996 --> 00:54:24,971
Isn't that our good fortune?

586
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,768
I was wondering if you knew
if your son had any enemies.

587
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:31,472
You mean other than the thousands
of Iraqis and foreign fighters...

588
00:54:31,472 --> 00:54:33,907
...trying to kill him
till a couple of weeks ago?

589
00:54:33,909 --> 00:54:37,945
Yeah, that shirt looks like it's still wet.

590
00:54:37,947 --> 00:54:39,746
It's dry enough.

591
00:54:39,981 --> 00:54:42,617
Anything bothering him
that you know about?

592
00:54:42,617 --> 00:54:44,016
No.

593
00:54:44,186 --> 00:54:46,721
You looking into the gang connection?

594
00:54:46,722 --> 00:54:50,657
Why? You have reason to think your son
was involved in gangs or drugs?

595
00:54:50,659 --> 00:54:52,126
No.

596
00:54:53,228 --> 00:54:55,862
- When did you last speak to him?
- Why?

597
00:54:55,864 --> 00:54:59,701
Capital One faxed me a recent summary
of his credit-card charges.

598
00:54:59,702 --> 00:55:01,802
After he got back,
he bought tube socks...

599
00:55:01,804 --> 00:55:04,539
I told him a dozen times,
those are the worst socks.

600
00:55:04,539 --> 00:55:07,875
They have no heel,
they wear right through.

601
00:55:07,876 --> 00:55:11,179
And then he went out for some chicken.

602
00:55:11,179 --> 00:55:13,014
Does it say what time?

603
00:55:13,014 --> 00:55:15,159
And no more charges.

604
00:55:15,851 --> 00:55:20,221
We assume your son was killed sometime
Saturday night or Sunday morning.

605
00:55:20,222 --> 00:55:22,824
We haven't found his wallet,
but if it was stolen...

606
00:55:22,824 --> 00:55:27,661
...we'd see a lot more charges on it,
like computers, stereos, what have you.

607
00:55:27,663 --> 00:55:31,724
Have you been to the chicken place yet?

608
00:55:46,815 --> 00:55:50,047
- Enjoy.
- How can I help you?

609
00:55:50,184 --> 00:55:52,954
We're inquiring about a soldier
who was here a week ago.

610
00:55:52,954 --> 00:55:55,722
You're kidding me, right?
We're a block from the base.

611
00:55:55,724 --> 00:55:57,791
Can you tell what time he was here?

612
00:55:57,793 --> 00:56:00,260
It's the last four digits.

613
00:56:00,262 --> 00:56:05,266
1:03 a.m. Sunday morning.
We bill that as Saturday. Anything else?

614
00:56:05,266 --> 00:56:09,103
- Can you tell us what he bought?
- Not without the actual receipt.

615
00:56:09,103 --> 00:56:11,072
Okay. Thank you.

616
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:15,143
Your four-piece dinner is $6.79.
Is that what most people order?

617
00:56:15,143 --> 00:56:16,744
That or the three-piece.

618
00:56:16,744 --> 00:56:18,610
So with tax...

619
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,610
...$21.77 would be...

620
00:56:22,784 --> 00:56:24,885
...three meals, three people.

621
00:56:24,887 --> 00:56:31,125
Four, if it's the three-piece,
or one really hungry soldier.

622
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,822
There you are.
I just dropped something off for you.

623
00:57:00,822 --> 00:57:03,590
- You did?
- We took statements from Mike's squad.

624
00:57:03,592 --> 00:57:05,059
Thought you'd want them.

625
00:57:05,059 --> 00:57:08,028
That's great. I was gonna call you
to arrange interviews.

626
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:10,346
Saved you the trouble.

627
00:57:10,632 --> 00:57:12,360
How so?

628
00:57:12,534 --> 00:57:15,302
Sworn statements on your desk.

629
00:57:15,304 --> 00:57:18,972
What, you didn't think
I'd want to interview them myself?

630
00:57:18,974 --> 00:57:21,641
Just trying to give you a leg up.

631
00:57:21,643 --> 00:57:24,411
Thanks. I sort of like to do
my own detective work.

632
00:57:24,413 --> 00:57:26,481
I'll tell you what.

633
00:57:26,481 --> 00:57:27,949
Read the statements.

634
00:57:27,949 --> 00:57:32,820
If you still wanna question them,
I will be glad to take the request to my C.O.

635
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,588
Perhaps you misunderstood me.

636
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:37,724
It's not a request.
I want the list of the men in his unit.

637
00:57:37,726 --> 00:57:40,628
- On your desk.
- And I wanna interview them this afternoon.

638
00:57:40,628 --> 00:57:42,829
You'll have to go to my C.O.
With that one.

639
00:57:42,831 --> 00:57:46,833
- My chief already spoke to him.
- This one's a bit of a jurisdictional mess.

640
00:57:46,835 --> 00:57:50,538
There is no mess. The murder was
committed in our jurisdiction.

641
00:57:50,539 --> 00:57:53,840
That's where it gets murky. Read those.

642
00:57:53,842 --> 00:57:57,545
I'd be glad to put the request in.

643
00:58:02,684 --> 00:58:06,153
- You don't have the sworn statements?
- I have the statements...

644
00:58:06,155 --> 00:58:08,623
Then they're cooperating.
I don't see the problem.

645
00:58:08,623 --> 00:58:10,992
I have a right to interview
potential witnesses.

646
00:58:10,992 --> 00:58:14,762
- Has the Army said you can't?
- They said they'd consider my request.

647
00:58:14,762 --> 00:58:16,329
And that was 10 minutes ago.

648
00:58:16,331 --> 00:58:19,699
And I'd like to talk to these men
before they've been coached...

649
00:58:19,701 --> 00:58:23,704
...or debriefed so any inconsistencies
in their stories will have disappeared.

650
00:58:23,704 --> 00:58:26,574
Being a former military man,
I'm sure you've seen that...

651
00:58:26,574 --> 00:58:31,846
...perhaps when you served
with Lieutenant Kirklander?

652
00:58:31,847 --> 00:58:33,976
I'll tell you what.

653
00:58:34,115 --> 00:58:37,885
Skip upstairs and cry to your boyfriend.

654
00:58:37,885 --> 00:58:43,092
Because I'm just not in the mood
to give a shit.

655
00:59:24,032 --> 00:59:28,603
We're showing video that has
just come in to CNN from Fallujah.

656
00:59:28,603 --> 00:59:30,333
You ordered yet?

657
00:59:37,945 --> 00:59:39,918
Okay. Dig in, men.

658
00:59:58,532 --> 01:00:00,762
- May I?
- Please.

659
01:00:03,405 --> 01:00:06,641
- Okay. Out.
- No, I can do it.

660
01:00:06,641 --> 01:00:11,375
You can. Now get ready for bed. Go on.

661
01:00:17,853 --> 01:00:20,740
Is there anything I can do?

662
01:00:48,583 --> 01:00:50,483
You're supposed to read it to me.

663
01:00:50,485 --> 01:00:52,952
I don't understand one word of it.

664
01:00:52,954 --> 01:00:55,322
Well, do you know any stories?

665
01:00:55,324 --> 01:00:57,657
I'm not much of a storyteller.

666
01:00:57,659 --> 01:01:00,632
Well, then read me the book.

667
01:01:06,467 --> 01:01:08,668
You know where your name comes from?

668
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:11,916
- My mother?
- No, before that.

669
01:01:12,139 --> 01:01:15,710
You're named after King David.
Your mother didn't tell you that?

670
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:17,110
That figures.

671
01:01:22,351 --> 01:01:23,875
All right.

672
01:01:24,318 --> 01:01:28,889
There were two great armies assembled,
the Israelites and the Philistines.

673
01:01:28,889 --> 01:01:31,858
They were both up on hills,
the Valley of Elah in between.

674
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:34,228
It's in Palestine, you know where it is?

675
01:01:34,228 --> 01:01:35,596
- No.
- Doesn't matter.

676
01:01:35,597 --> 01:01:39,300
Anyway, the Philistines had a champion.

677
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:42,065
A huge giant...

678
01:01:42,237 --> 01:01:43,981
...named Goliath.

679
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:46,440
Really? There's a robot named Goliath.

680
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,208
This is a different guy.

681
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:51,668
So every day, for 40 days...

682
01:01:51,847 --> 01:01:54,715
...Goliath would stride down
into the valley...

683
01:01:54,715 --> 01:01:58,251
...and challenge somebody from the
other side to fight, but nobody would.

684
01:01:58,253 --> 01:02:02,389
All the bravest and strongest warriors
that the king had were all too scared.

685
01:02:02,391 --> 01:02:05,925
- Why didn't they just shoot him?
- They didn't have guns.

686
01:02:05,927 --> 01:02:08,228
They had arrows,
but there are rules to combat.

687
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:12,699
You don't shoot somebody that's
challenging you to fight with a sword.

688
01:02:12,701 --> 01:02:14,224
So anyway...

689
01:02:14,902 --> 01:02:20,240
...one day this kid, not much bigger
than you, comes delivering bread.

690
01:02:20,242 --> 01:02:22,543
He says to the king, "I'll fight Goliath."

691
01:02:22,543 --> 01:02:24,878
- Really? No way.
- True story.

692
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,416
So the king dresses David
in his own armor.

693
01:02:28,416 --> 01:02:32,452
But it's much too big and heavy,
so David takes it off and he looks around...

694
01:02:32,454 --> 01:02:35,856
...and he finds five smooth stones
about that big.

695
01:02:35,856 --> 01:02:41,394
And he steps out into the valley,
with his slingshot in his hand.

696
01:02:41,396 --> 01:02:43,396
Goliath comes running...

697
01:02:43,398 --> 01:02:45,800
...yelling this horrible scream.

698
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,469
And David lets fly with that slingshot.

699
01:02:48,469 --> 01:02:51,005
Hits him in the forehead,
cracks his skull open...

700
01:02:51,005 --> 01:02:53,807
...Goliath falls down, dead.

701
01:02:53,809 --> 01:02:55,443
So he shot him.

702
01:02:55,443 --> 01:02:58,833
With a rock. Not the same thing.

703
01:03:01,949 --> 01:03:04,952
- And you want to know how he beat him?
- How?

704
01:03:04,952 --> 01:03:09,422
The first thing David had to fight
was his own fear.

705
01:03:09,423 --> 01:03:12,570
He beat that, he beat Goliath.

706
01:03:12,726 --> 01:03:17,565
Because when Goliath came running,
David planted his feet, took aim and waited.

707
01:03:17,565 --> 01:03:20,768
You know how much courage that took?

708
01:03:20,768 --> 01:03:26,505
Just a few more steps
and Goliath would've crushed him.

709
01:03:26,574 --> 01:03:29,878
Then he let fly with that rock.

710
01:03:30,679 --> 01:03:33,614
That's how you fight monsters.

711
01:03:33,614 --> 01:03:37,418
You lure them in close to you,
you look them in the eye...

712
01:03:37,418 --> 01:03:39,820
...you smack them down.

713
01:03:41,121 --> 01:03:43,090
You fight a lot of monsters?

714
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:44,318
Yeah.

715
01:03:44,626 --> 01:03:46,253
You win?

716
01:03:46,728 --> 01:03:49,028
If I didn't, I'd have been crushed, right?

717
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:50,554
Yeah.

718
01:03:51,199 --> 01:03:53,030
Okay, then.

719
01:03:54,135 --> 01:03:55,396
Good night.

720
01:04:09,351 --> 01:04:11,619
He likes to sleep with that door open.

721
01:04:11,619 --> 01:04:13,248
He'll be okay.

722
01:04:23,565 --> 01:04:25,362
Door!

723
01:04:32,503 --> 01:04:35,302
- Not that much.
- Okay.

724
01:04:37,307 --> 01:04:38,693
That's good.

725
01:04:55,092 --> 01:04:57,161
You know that story isn't true.

726
01:04:57,161 --> 01:04:59,376
Of course it's true.

727
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:02,574
It's even in the Koran.

728
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:09,940
- May I read the men's statements?
- There is nothing in them that'll help.

729
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:18,355
The last time any of the men saw Mike was
Saturday afternoon, before he left base.

730
01:05:25,923 --> 01:05:28,224
You're a good father.

731
01:05:29,293 --> 01:05:32,963
You don't have to prove you loved him.

732
01:05:32,963 --> 01:05:35,125
I'm sure he knew.

733
01:05:54,585 --> 01:05:56,143
Dad?

734
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:02,152
Daddy?

735
01:06:06,697 --> 01:06:09,114
Something happened, Dad.

736
01:06:34,425 --> 01:06:36,893
It's the second day
of what the U.S. Military...

737
01:06:36,894 --> 01:06:41,644
... is now calling
the "New Dawn" in Fallujah.

738
01:06:46,603 --> 01:06:51,108
The operation is aimed at crushing
the insurgents in their strongholds.

739
01:06:51,108 --> 01:06:53,943
But how many insurgents are still there?

740
01:06:53,945 --> 01:06:56,480
We'll go live to the front lines
in a moment.

741
01:06:56,481 --> 01:06:58,108
Hi.

742
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:01,643
Evie, from the bar.

743
01:07:04,355 --> 01:07:05,652
"Ma'am"?

744
01:07:10,795 --> 01:07:12,284
Yeah.

745
01:07:12,963 --> 01:07:14,192
I'm sorry.

746
01:07:14,532 --> 01:07:15,896
Hello.

747
01:07:16,067 --> 01:07:18,201
I saw the picture of your son
in the paper.

748
01:07:18,202 --> 01:07:21,371
When you came in,
I thought he was just missing.

749
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:22,585
I'm sorry.

750
01:07:23,041 --> 01:07:24,668
Thank you.

751
01:07:26,844 --> 01:07:27,867
May I?

752
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:36,561
Nice eyes.

753
01:07:48,365 --> 01:07:50,009
Him I remember.

754
01:07:51,101 --> 01:07:54,804
I work in another bar on the weekends.
He was there.

755
01:07:54,806 --> 01:07:57,708
Must've been Saturday night.

756
01:07:58,509 --> 01:08:01,554
What's the name of that bar?

757
01:08:07,251 --> 01:08:09,585
- Yeah, they were here.
- Both of them?

758
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:12,356
- Yeah, them and their buddies.
- Saturday night?

759
01:08:12,356 --> 01:08:16,560
We had to throw them out. That one was
harassing one of the dancers, real asshole.

760
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,761
- This guy?
- Other one.

761
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:22,565
Get a lot of assholes in here,
but he was going for the prize.

762
01:08:22,567 --> 01:08:25,702
- Shouting obscenities at the dancers.
- You got the wrong man.

763
01:08:25,703 --> 01:08:29,105
You ask me to ID a guy,
and then you tell me that I'm wrong.

764
01:08:29,106 --> 01:08:30,836
You two related?

765
01:08:31,141 --> 01:08:32,542
What time they leave?

766
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:34,077
Fuck if I know.

767
01:08:34,078 --> 01:08:38,215
They weren't happy about it. Two of them
got into it out in the parking lot.

768
01:08:38,216 --> 01:08:41,585
Thought I was gonna have to
break it up myself.

769
01:08:41,586 --> 01:08:43,177
Thank you.

770
01:08:54,332 --> 01:08:57,434
Detective Nugent will stay
while you write out your statement.

771
01:08:57,435 --> 01:08:59,301
I want the pen back, Nugent.

772
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:00,827
Word?

773
01:09:08,813 --> 01:09:12,783
This is not Saigon. This is not 1967.
You do not question witnesses.

774
01:09:12,783 --> 01:09:14,751
I figured somebody should.

775
01:09:14,752 --> 01:09:17,753
It must be frustrating being
such a damn good investigator...

776
01:09:17,755 --> 01:09:22,091
...surrounded by incompetent fools.
Remind me, what is it you do in Munro?

777
01:09:22,092 --> 01:09:23,923
I haul gravel.

778
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,261
That's a shame.

779
01:09:25,262 --> 01:09:29,699
Think of all the crime that could've
been solved if you'd been on the job.

780
01:09:29,701 --> 01:09:32,935
This goes to trial, the defense
will say you poisoned the well.

781
01:09:32,936 --> 01:09:35,305
- It won't go to trial.
- What?

782
01:09:35,305 --> 01:09:36,939
- It wasn't them.
- I'm sorry?

783
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:41,177
I don't know why they lied about not
being with him, but they didn't do it.

784
01:09:41,179 --> 01:09:44,113
- They were fighting in the parking lot.
- Blowing off steam.

785
01:09:44,114 --> 01:09:46,850
You have not been to war
so you won't understand this.

786
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:51,387
You do not fight beside a man
and then do that to him.

787
01:09:51,389 --> 01:09:55,106
That's quite the world you live in.

788
01:09:55,126 --> 01:09:57,599
Find out why they lied.

789
01:10:01,798 --> 01:10:04,100
There'll be a reason.

790
01:10:14,811 --> 01:10:16,783
So you were there.

791
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:19,042
Yeah.

792
01:10:19,484 --> 01:10:21,650
So why would you lie?

793
01:10:21,652 --> 01:10:23,711
It's complicated.

794
01:10:24,521 --> 01:10:28,912
Why don't you just tell me
what happened?

795
01:10:32,029 --> 01:10:34,163
We were at this strip club.

796
01:10:34,164 --> 01:10:39,202
Just hanging out, having a good time.
We were drinking, of course.

797
01:10:39,203 --> 01:10:42,404
And Mike starts acting really weird.

798
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:44,807
Really angry,
throwing change at the stripper.

799
01:10:44,809 --> 01:10:46,576
Then he started talking trash...

800
01:10:46,577 --> 01:10:50,380
...so she started talking trash,
and they tossed us out.

801
01:10:50,381 --> 01:10:52,114
And we're getting in the car...

802
01:10:52,115 --> 01:10:54,885
...and Bonner's all pissed
saying Mike can walk.

803
01:10:54,886 --> 01:10:57,921
So Mike grabs him and they just
start going off on each other.

804
01:10:57,921 --> 01:11:01,024
But it's the kind of shit
that happens all the time.

805
01:11:01,024 --> 01:11:03,560
The whole macho-warrior crap.

806
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,228
Nobody got hurt.

807
01:11:05,229 --> 01:11:07,930
So we got in the car,
we drove around for a while.

808
01:11:07,931 --> 01:11:11,234
And then we stopped at the Chicken Shack,
across from the base.

809
01:11:11,234 --> 01:11:14,136
Mike bought, for getting us kicked out.

810
01:11:14,137 --> 01:11:18,140
- And what time was this?
- I don't know.

811
01:11:18,141 --> 01:11:19,404
Around 1.

812
01:11:19,944 --> 01:11:22,832
And then we came back here.

813
01:11:25,649 --> 01:11:27,242
All of you?

814
01:11:28,485 --> 01:11:29,918
No.

815
01:11:30,087 --> 01:11:32,387
Just the three of us.

816
01:11:34,492 --> 01:11:36,458
Why would you leave him there?

817
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:38,595
Because we were wasted.

818
01:11:38,595 --> 01:11:42,465
We had had enough,
but Mike wanted to find some meth.

819
01:11:42,466 --> 01:11:43,800
He wanted to buy drugs?

820
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:46,502
Yeah, like he needed
to be more fucked up.

821
01:11:46,503 --> 01:11:49,234
Pardon my language, ma'am.

822
01:11:49,372 --> 01:11:51,106
You think that's what happened?

823
01:11:51,108 --> 01:11:54,109
He went looking for drugs,
ran into the wrong people?

824
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:56,645
Who knows?
I mean, Mike always had secrets.

825
01:11:56,646 --> 01:12:00,917
You know, over there,
he was always sneaking off by himself.

826
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:05,755
He really didn't get along
too well with people.

827
01:12:05,756 --> 01:12:10,126
So you get kicked out of the strip club
at 11, show up at the Chicken Shack at 1.

828
01:12:10,127 --> 01:12:12,595
What were you doing
for a whole two hours?

829
01:12:12,596 --> 01:12:16,666
Driving around,
looking for a party, or women.

830
01:12:16,667 --> 01:12:18,983
Did you stop anywhere?

831
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:22,097
Yes, ma'am.

832
01:12:24,442 --> 01:12:27,158
Now you want me to guess?

833
01:12:28,345 --> 01:12:31,381
We found a hooker
over on Ten Mile Road.

834
01:12:31,381 --> 01:12:34,011
She blew all four of us.

835
01:12:34,518 --> 01:12:36,987
Why didn't you say that
when you were questioned?

836
01:12:36,988 --> 01:12:39,355
We didn't think Mike
wanted his parents to know.

837
01:12:39,356 --> 01:12:41,757
You didn't want his father
to know he got a blow job?

838
01:12:41,759 --> 01:12:46,962
And was buying drugs. I wouldn't
want somebody telling my parents.

839
01:12:46,963 --> 01:12:48,998
So, what was the fight about?

840
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,735
Mike was in some dark mood.
I don't know why.

841
01:12:52,737 --> 01:12:56,338
And then he started saying
nasty things to that stripper.

842
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:57,533
Like what?

843
01:12:57,707 --> 01:13:01,944
Stuff I'm not gonna repeat. The woman's
a stripper, not something on your shoe.

844
01:13:01,945 --> 01:13:05,649
Out in the parking lot, Penning
said Mike came at you swinging.

845
01:13:05,649 --> 01:13:07,283
Might have, I don't recall.

846
01:13:07,284 --> 01:13:10,319
What was different about that night?
That you had a knife?

847
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,988
I don't need a knife, ma'am.

848
01:13:11,988 --> 01:13:14,490
I guess back in Iraq things are different.

849
01:13:14,492 --> 01:13:17,159
Somebody makes you mad,
you can deal with it, right?

850
01:13:17,161 --> 01:13:19,662
- You lost me.
- It's a whole different world.

851
01:13:19,663 --> 01:13:22,332
- You got power.
- You've never been in the Army.

852
01:13:22,332 --> 01:13:24,868
But I know that you've got
weapons and authority.

853
01:13:24,868 --> 01:13:28,371
You put men facedown in the dirt,
step on their backs, kick in doors.

854
01:13:28,372 --> 01:13:30,340
Somebody comes at you, you kill them.

855
01:13:30,341 --> 01:13:33,643
You have to. The guy could have
bombs, guns, you don't know.

856
01:13:33,644 --> 01:13:35,478
- Kill him first.
- You make the call.

857
01:13:35,479 --> 01:13:37,913
React or die, isn't that what they say?
Ever stab someone?

858
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:41,650
- If I did, it wouldn't be your business.
- There one day, back here another.

859
01:13:41,652 --> 01:13:45,822
I gotta tell you, somebody comes
charging at me, I'd reach for my weapon.

860
01:13:45,823 --> 01:13:48,358
- The interview is over.
- I'm glad none of this bothered you.

861
01:13:48,359 --> 01:13:51,293
I gotta tell you,
I saw my father come back from war.

862
01:13:51,295 --> 01:13:53,997
Things he couldn't deal with
pretty much destroyed him.

863
01:13:53,997 --> 01:13:56,231
- What was he, in Panama?
- Enough.

864
01:13:56,233 --> 01:13:58,501
You have no idea what we did,
and we did it for you.

865
01:13:58,502 --> 01:13:59,903
- For me?
- If I were you...

866
01:13:59,904 --> 01:14:02,939
...I'd just say thanks, leave it at that,
and kiss my ass.

867
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:04,635
Walk away.

868
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:09,011
You happy now? You want to
convene a war-crimes tribunal?

869
01:14:09,012 --> 01:14:10,779
I want the clothes they wore.

870
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:13,682
I want to take full-body photographs
for cuts and bruises.

871
01:14:13,684 --> 01:14:16,319
Ma'am, you can have
all the undies you want.

872
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:21,039
But you might want to
take a glance at this.

873
01:14:24,996 --> 01:14:27,140
You still want them?

874
01:14:28,399 --> 01:14:29,422
Yeah.

875
01:15:03,466 --> 01:15:11,051
Hey, you better hang up, Saddam could
be calling. "Mike, Mike, I give up."

876
01:15:34,497 --> 01:15:38,159
- Leave him alone!
- Fuck you, man.

877
01:15:58,823 --> 01:16:02,484
- Leave him alone!
- Fuck you, man.

878
01:16:09,265 --> 01:16:12,534
You were right.
They couldn't have done it.

879
01:16:12,536 --> 01:16:15,604
They were with Mike
at the Chicken Shack at 1.

880
01:16:15,605 --> 01:16:21,610
Bonner, Penning and Long
arrived back at base 20 minutes later.

881
01:16:21,612 --> 01:16:26,048
The field where we found
Mike's remains is a half an hour away.

882
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:28,917
There's no way they
could've driven there in time.

883
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:30,783
Never mind...

884
01:16:32,622 --> 01:16:35,095
So they left him there?

885
01:16:35,493 --> 01:16:42,231
- They said Mike wanted to buy drugs.
- And that's why they lied?

886
01:16:47,971 --> 01:16:51,373
And they had no idea where he went
when they left him, or who he met?

887
01:16:51,375 --> 01:16:55,545
No. And I have statements
from every other man in the squad.

888
01:16:55,546 --> 01:16:57,345
May I see those?

889
01:17:01,252 --> 01:17:04,787
If they're telling the truth,
no one saw him after dinnertime.

890
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:10,993
Yeah. Lab says no traces of blood
on their clothes or their belongings.

891
01:17:10,994 --> 01:17:13,395
Did you look at these clothes?

892
01:17:13,396 --> 01:17:15,064
I mean, look at this shirt.

893
01:17:15,064 --> 01:17:17,466
It has crease marks
where it came off the shelf.

894
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:19,168
Clothes are cheap on the base.

895
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:22,971
First thing you do when you get back
is toss every stitch you took with you.

896
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:27,636
There are nine soldiers
in an infantry squad.

897
01:17:27,778 --> 01:17:29,511
- Yeah?
- They lost a man in Iraq.

898
01:17:29,512 --> 01:17:32,614
There ought to be seven statements here
and there's only six.

899
01:17:32,615 --> 01:17:34,617
So one of them's on leave.

900
01:17:34,618 --> 01:17:42,515
When I got here, the sergeant told me
all of his men were back from liberty.

901
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:44,957
Read the names.

902
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:47,997
- Yeah.
- Hi, this is Fred Gainley...

903
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:51,600
...at the Buxton sheriff's office.
Are you missing a man?

904
01:17:51,601 --> 01:17:55,404
Because I have a Robert Ortiez here
on a drunk and disorderly...

905
01:17:55,405 --> 01:17:56,972
... says he's one of yours.

906
01:17:56,974 --> 01:18:01,277
- Thanks. I'll send someone over to get him.
- I appreciate it, thank you.

907
01:18:01,278 --> 01:18:02,609
He's AWOL.

908
01:18:02,779 --> 01:18:05,180
Check for priors and warrants.

909
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:07,969
And see if he owns a car.

910
01:18:14,992 --> 01:18:16,458
Bad boy.

911
01:18:17,694 --> 01:18:19,095
He's a local boy.

912
01:18:19,095 --> 01:18:22,564
First arrested Bobby Ortiez
when he was 14, for drug trafficking.

913
01:18:22,565 --> 01:18:24,701
Got bail and the witness disappeared.

914
01:18:24,702 --> 01:18:27,537
A year and a half ago
we liked him for drug smuggling.

915
01:18:27,537 --> 01:18:29,838
Suddenly he gets all patriotic
and joins up.

916
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,707
How did they let him in the Army?

917
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:33,408
No felony convictions.

918
01:18:33,409 --> 01:18:36,112
They've lowered standards
every month since this started.

919
01:18:36,113 --> 01:18:39,314
There's a 1999 Chevrolet Malibu
registered in his name.

920
01:18:39,315 --> 01:18:40,976
What color?

921
01:18:41,985 --> 01:18:43,510
Blue.

922
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:46,189
- That's not enough for a warrant.
- He's AWOL.

923
01:18:46,189 --> 01:18:48,190
The Army can go after him, we can't.

924
01:18:48,192 --> 01:18:52,060
Well, he's got four
unpaid parking tickets.

925
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:53,877
Try Judge Osorio.

926
01:18:53,997 --> 01:18:56,265
Any idea where our boy might be?

927
01:18:56,266 --> 01:18:59,756
Finding Bobby's never the problem.

928
01:19:01,939 --> 01:19:05,899
Go back to your motel. I'll call you.

929
01:19:42,546 --> 01:19:44,274
Police! Open up!

930
01:19:56,327 --> 01:19:58,283
He's on the roof!

931
01:20:01,597 --> 01:20:03,259
I got him!

932
01:20:05,769 --> 01:20:11,606
Take the street, not the alley.
Take the street, jackass.

933
01:21:05,229 --> 01:21:06,890
Shit.

934
01:21:29,987 --> 01:21:34,894
Fucking wetbacks.
It's always knives, isn't it?

935
01:21:35,091 --> 01:21:37,908
You like cutting people up?

936
01:21:42,599 --> 01:21:44,667
What the hell are you doing?

937
01:21:44,667 --> 01:21:46,969
Come here! Come on! Get off him.

938
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:48,871
Hey! I didn't do it!

939
01:21:48,872 --> 01:21:50,586
Don't you move.

940
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:53,176
Don't you fucking move.

941
01:21:53,176 --> 01:21:55,043
- Jesus.
- You okay?

942
01:21:55,045 --> 01:21:56,534
Fuck.

943
01:22:06,289 --> 01:22:07,951
Change him up.

944
01:22:08,125 --> 01:22:09,614
All right.

945
01:22:11,528 --> 01:22:14,831
Good. We'll take him from here.

946
01:22:22,072 --> 01:22:25,908
What was it, chico? You wanted him
to carry drugs and he wouldn't do it?

947
01:22:25,908 --> 01:22:27,676
Is that it, chico?

948
01:22:27,677 --> 01:22:29,712
Afraid he was gonna tell on you?

949
01:22:29,712 --> 01:22:32,515
Wouldn't it be funny if the devil
looked just like you?

950
01:22:32,515 --> 01:22:36,351
Come back here, you wetback prick.
I'll show you what the devil looks like.

951
01:22:36,353 --> 01:22:37,909
Fuck you, man!

952
01:22:38,521 --> 01:22:42,524
- I see you cracked him wide open.
- Put your hand up.

953
01:22:42,525 --> 01:22:44,393
He isn't pressing any charges.

954
01:22:44,394 --> 01:22:48,029
And you're damn lucky I feel pity on you,
or I'd be doing it myself.

955
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:49,599
I didn't mean to hit you.

956
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,533
That's an apology in your world?

957
01:22:51,534 --> 01:22:53,059
I'm sorry.

958
01:22:53,237 --> 01:22:55,238
- Keep it.
- Won't anybody question him?

959
01:22:55,238 --> 01:22:58,341
I questioned him! They questioned him!
We searched his house.

960
01:22:58,341 --> 01:23:03,649
There's no evidence
he had anything to do with it.

961
01:24:08,244 --> 01:24:10,404
Something's happened.

962
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:15,561
Found him hanging in his room.

963
01:24:20,423 --> 01:24:22,358
Jesus.

964
01:24:23,327 --> 01:24:26,386
- Did he leave a note?
- No.

965
01:24:53,155 --> 01:24:59,962
My father gave it to me when
I went to Vietnam. I gave it to Mike.

966
01:24:59,962 --> 01:25:02,530
It was in Bonner's pants pocket.

967
01:25:02,532 --> 01:25:04,625
He was carrying it?

968
01:25:06,369 --> 01:25:09,537
He didn't leave a note.
He put it in his pocket and hung himself?

969
01:25:09,538 --> 01:25:11,029
I'm sorry.

970
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:15,543
But this is as close as we're
gonna get to a confession.

971
01:25:15,545 --> 01:25:17,206
Confession.

972
01:25:25,921 --> 01:25:29,225
Bonner's car. What color is it?

973
01:25:30,193 --> 01:25:32,854
Blue. Why?

974
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:46,841
You don't kill someone for no reason.
That watch doesn't prove anything.

975
01:25:46,842 --> 01:25:48,711
Think your son would give him that?

976
01:25:48,712 --> 01:25:51,313
- It could've been planted.
- Why did he kill himself?

977
01:25:51,314 --> 01:25:53,416
I don't know. Tell me how he killed Mike.

978
01:25:53,417 --> 01:25:56,652
He had an alibi, he was at the base.
Why'd he kill him? When?

979
01:25:56,653 --> 01:25:58,194
I don't know.

980
01:26:06,896 --> 01:26:09,421
- What?
- Hey.

981
01:26:12,234 --> 01:26:18,244
You remember...? You remember
that woman with the dead dog?

982
01:27:20,337 --> 01:27:22,305
We drained it.

983
01:27:40,289 --> 01:27:42,154
Where's the boy?

984
01:27:42,324 --> 01:27:45,528
He wasn't home, thank God.
He was at his grandparents'.

985
01:27:45,529 --> 01:27:47,326
That's good.

986
01:27:47,963 --> 01:27:49,625
That's good.

987
01:29:04,373 --> 01:29:08,243
The remains will be shipped this afternoon.
Check the address of the funeral home.

988
01:29:08,244 --> 01:29:09,478
That's correct.

989
01:29:09,479 --> 01:29:14,685
If I can be of any other help,
just let me know.

990
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:19,005
Sir?

991
01:30:23,153 --> 01:30:25,884
You got any jumper cables?

992
01:30:34,997 --> 01:30:36,465
Thanks.

993
01:30:40,403 --> 01:30:45,673
I wanted to say how sorry I am
for what happened to Mike.

994
01:30:45,675 --> 01:30:51,046
And I wanted to apologize for lying
about not seeing him that night.

995
01:30:51,046 --> 01:30:58,515
I just thought that if I were Mike,
I wouldn't want my parents to know.

996
01:30:59,221 --> 01:31:02,382
- You got a cigarette?
- Yeah.

997
01:31:20,342 --> 01:31:23,246
You think Bonner killed him?

998
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:26,338
No.

999
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:29,381
I don't know.

1000
01:31:31,253 --> 01:31:34,556
I don't understand any of this.

1001
01:31:35,792 --> 01:31:37,792
What would he have against my boy?

1002
01:31:37,793 --> 01:31:39,386
Nothing.

1003
01:31:41,230 --> 01:31:42,755
I'm sorry.

1004
01:31:45,935 --> 01:31:49,805
- Mike tell you much about Bosnia?
- Some.

1005
01:31:49,805 --> 01:31:56,377
We seemed to always pull sentry duty
together. Freezing our asses off.

1006
01:31:56,378 --> 01:31:58,479
He tried to convince me
of crazy things.

1007
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,615
Try to get you to wear pantyhose?

1008
01:32:00,617 --> 01:32:02,751
- Did he tell you?
- No, I told him.

1009
01:32:02,752 --> 01:32:06,069
Cuts the cold like nothing else.

1010
01:32:06,422 --> 01:32:07,989
So he wasn't lying?

1011
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:16,203
You don't want to get shot wearing
a pair of those. You'll never live it down.

1012
01:32:35,952 --> 01:32:38,319
It's fucked up, isn't it?

1013
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:39,787
Yeah.

1014
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:07,181
Let's get you to a good
American hospital.

1015
01:33:07,182 --> 01:33:09,885
Come on, speed this thing up!

1016
01:33:09,886 --> 01:33:13,173
It's okay. I'm gonna help you.

1017
01:33:13,789 --> 01:33:15,858
It's okay. Take it easy.

1018
01:33:15,859 --> 01:33:19,577
We're gonna take care of you, okay?

1019
01:33:22,698 --> 01:33:25,257
You okay? You all right?

1020
01:33:26,101 --> 01:33:29,921
Now, where does it hurt? Right there?

1021
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:32,801
Easy. Right there?

1022
01:33:33,208 --> 01:33:36,926
We're gonna take care of you, okay?

1023
01:34:13,615 --> 01:34:15,048
Good night.

1024
01:35:14,143 --> 01:35:18,779
Tell me that's your son's signature
on his credit-card receipt.

1025
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:20,771
No, it is not.

1026
01:35:21,184 --> 01:35:23,918
We always assumed Mike was there.

1027
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:26,320
That's Penning's signature.

1028
01:35:26,322 --> 01:35:30,155
Three meals. Penning, Bonner and Long.

1029
01:36:05,962 --> 01:36:09,230
Penning and Long. I want them now.

1030
01:36:09,231 --> 01:36:14,536
- I can't give them to you.
- Oh, yes, you can. And you will.

1031
01:36:14,537 --> 01:36:17,072
Corporal Penning has come forward.

1032
01:36:17,073 --> 01:36:20,390
He's implicated Long and Bonner.

1033
01:36:20,743 --> 01:36:22,872
You son of a bitch.

1034
01:36:23,011 --> 01:36:25,913
You went to him with a fucking deal,
didn't you?

1035
01:36:25,914 --> 01:36:29,917
- He'll do serious time.
- Yeah? How serious, huh?

1036
01:36:29,918 --> 01:36:32,786
How serious? How much time?

1037
01:36:33,722 --> 01:36:36,266
As much as I could get.

1038
01:36:37,859 --> 01:36:40,194
Well, luckily for me, that means shit.

1039
01:36:40,195 --> 01:36:42,863
You see these? Those are warrants.

1040
01:36:42,864 --> 01:36:46,268
We have jurisdiction,
you're compelled to deliver those men.

1041
01:36:46,269 --> 01:36:48,069
I want them now.

1042
01:36:49,372 --> 01:36:53,274
I am not the only one who made a deal.

1043
01:36:53,275 --> 01:36:55,844
My C.O. Talked to yours.

1044
01:36:55,845 --> 01:36:59,820
It is just one less headache for them.

1045
01:37:00,048 --> 01:37:02,216
It's out of our hands now.

1046
01:37:02,217 --> 01:37:03,742
I'm sorry.

1047
01:37:05,621 --> 01:37:07,248
I bet you are.

1048
01:37:10,726 --> 01:37:12,828
I wanna hear the confession.

1049
01:37:12,828 --> 01:37:15,564
Long isn't speaking.
I'll get you Penning's statement.

1050
01:37:15,564 --> 01:37:19,400
No, I wanna hear it from his lips,
and I want him present.

1051
01:37:19,402 --> 01:37:21,961
That's not gonna happen.

1052
01:37:25,041 --> 01:37:27,842
How many soldiers
leave this base every night...

1053
01:37:27,844 --> 01:37:30,244
...to go visit a bar, have a drink or two?

1054
01:37:30,246 --> 01:37:33,814
- I know you're feeling burned.
- I'm not burned, I'm fucking pissed off.

1055
01:37:33,815 --> 01:37:37,652
Take a guess. On an average weekend,
what, seven, eight thousand soldiers?

1056
01:37:37,653 --> 01:37:41,122
You know what? I'm gonna sit in my car
outside any of your entrances...

1057
01:37:41,123 --> 01:37:44,225
...and pull over every vehicle
that comes back to this base...

1058
01:37:44,226 --> 01:37:49,331
...and I will arrest every soldier whose blood
alcohol is 1/1000 over the legal limit.

1059
01:37:49,332 --> 01:37:52,634
- How many men would that be?
- And how long till you're fired?

1060
01:37:52,635 --> 01:37:55,503
I'll do it on my own time,
and we have a good union...

1061
01:37:55,505 --> 01:37:58,105
...so I'm gonna say four to five weeks.

1062
01:37:58,106 --> 01:38:03,078
How many DUI's do you think
I could make in a month?

1063
01:38:03,078 --> 01:38:05,136
Should we find out?

1064
01:38:23,666 --> 01:38:25,634
Commander's office.

1065
01:38:25,635 --> 01:38:31,773
- Let me speak to Captain Henning, please.
- One moment, sir.

1066
01:38:31,774 --> 01:38:33,641
We were leaving the strip club.

1067
01:38:33,643 --> 01:38:36,478
And we thought that Mike and Bonner
have cooled down.

1068
01:38:36,479 --> 01:38:40,481
They could be like that,
laughing one minute and fighting the next.

1069
01:38:40,483 --> 01:38:43,318
Anyway, we're in the car,
and Mike's all pissy...

1070
01:38:43,319 --> 01:38:46,555
...and Bonner just starts needling him.

1071
01:38:46,555 --> 01:38:48,489
Just saying shit.

1072
01:38:48,658 --> 01:38:50,319
Like what?

1073
01:38:50,525 --> 01:38:54,395
I don't know.
Like what a good driver Mike is.

1074
01:38:54,396 --> 01:38:56,497
Stuff that makes no sense.

1075
01:38:56,498 --> 01:38:58,733
But Bonner has enough,
and he pulls over...

1076
01:38:58,734 --> 01:39:02,636
...and they just start
going off on each other.

1077
01:39:02,637 --> 01:39:06,240
And Long was yelling for them
to cut it out so we can go home.

1078
01:39:06,242 --> 01:39:09,077
And Mike starts cussing at him too...

1079
01:39:09,078 --> 01:39:13,347
...and then I look down,
and I'm stabbing him.

1080
01:39:13,349 --> 01:39:15,283
You...? You are?

1081
01:39:16,152 --> 01:39:17,551
Yeah.

1082
01:39:20,422 --> 01:39:22,823
And your friends didn't try and stop you?

1083
01:39:22,824 --> 01:39:26,386
I think they were sort of stunned.

1084
01:39:26,761 --> 01:39:28,363
They're yelling.

1085
01:39:28,363 --> 01:39:33,083
And Mike falls to the ground,
and he's dead.

1086
01:39:33,235 --> 01:39:38,557
And Long is screaming,
"Christ, what do we do now?"

1087
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:42,444
It was Bonner's idea to chop him up.

1088
01:39:42,444 --> 01:39:45,180
He used to work for a butcher.

1089
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:50,585
He knew how to work the knife
around the joints. Made it easier.

1090
01:39:50,586 --> 01:39:53,421
We would've buried the parts...

1091
01:39:53,421 --> 01:39:58,399
...but it was getting late
and we hadn't eaten.

1092
01:39:59,028 --> 01:40:00,962
You were hungry?

1093
01:40:01,130 --> 01:40:02,688
Starving.

1094
01:40:04,699 --> 01:40:08,018
We stopped at the Chicken Shack.

1095
01:40:09,971 --> 01:40:12,688
I liked Mike, we all did.

1096
01:40:13,809 --> 01:40:21,783
But I think on another night that would've
been Mike with the knife and me in the field.

1097
01:40:21,783 --> 01:40:24,914
I think he was the smart one.

1098
01:40:26,322 --> 01:40:28,622
I think he could see.

1099
01:40:32,595 --> 01:40:34,895
I'm truly sorry, sir.

1100
01:40:36,431 --> 01:40:39,061
I'm sorry for your loss.

1101
01:40:48,677 --> 01:40:51,279
I saw a video Mike shot.

1102
01:40:51,279 --> 01:40:54,324
Him in the back of a Humvee.

1103
01:40:57,453 --> 01:41:02,117
Looked like he was
torturing a prisoner or...

1104
01:41:07,296 --> 01:41:11,595
We arrested some haji who was wounded.

1105
01:41:12,835 --> 01:41:15,652
And we were riding along...

1106
01:41:15,738 --> 01:41:18,672
...and Mike was pretending
like he was a medic.

1107
01:41:18,673 --> 01:41:23,877
And he would stick his hand
in this guy's wound...

1108
01:41:23,878 --> 01:41:26,680
...and he says, "Does this hurt?"

1109
01:41:26,681 --> 01:41:30,344
And the haji screamed, "Yeah, yeah."

1110
01:41:30,987 --> 01:41:34,823
And then Mike would stick his hand
in the exact same place...

1111
01:41:34,823 --> 01:41:37,813
...and say, "Does that hurt?"

1112
01:41:41,796 --> 01:41:43,940
It was pretty funny.

1113
01:41:47,069 --> 01:41:50,042
It became a thing with Mike.

1114
01:41:51,740 --> 01:41:55,287
That's how he got the name "Doc."

1115
01:41:56,244 --> 01:41:59,118
It was just a way to cope.

1116
01:42:00,015 --> 01:42:02,661
We all did stupid things.

1117
01:42:45,728 --> 01:42:47,719
Excuse me, sir.

1118
01:43:06,114 --> 01:43:10,262
You know where Private Ortiez's room is?

1119
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:20,747
You got a minute?

1120
01:43:23,498 --> 01:43:25,966
I need to apologize to you.

1121
01:43:25,967 --> 01:43:28,302
You got some real serious issues, man.

1122
01:43:28,304 --> 01:43:29,793
Yeah.

1123
01:43:31,673 --> 01:43:33,301
That's true.

1124
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:50,057
I got a honorable discharge,
if you could believe it.

1125
01:43:50,059 --> 01:43:53,948
It's the Army, I'll believe anything.

1126
01:43:54,630 --> 01:43:57,016
I hated it over there.

1127
01:43:57,032 --> 01:44:00,301
Sleep in fucking tents.
No toilets, no showers.

1128
01:44:00,301 --> 01:44:04,121
No toilet paper, gotta use your hand.

1129
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:07,298
I couldn't wait to get out.

1130
01:44:08,877 --> 01:44:11,279
After two weeks here...

1131
01:44:13,349 --> 01:44:16,479
...all I wanna do is go back.

1132
01:44:18,186 --> 01:44:20,279
How fucked is that?

1133
01:44:30,332 --> 01:44:32,719
You know what that is?

1134
01:44:36,505 --> 01:44:39,039
Mike took it and e-mailed it to me.

1135
01:44:39,041 --> 01:44:41,341
Why would he do that?

1136
01:44:48,216 --> 01:44:52,177
I don't know what anybody's told you.

1137
01:44:52,854 --> 01:44:55,088
There are standing orders.

1138
01:44:55,090 --> 01:44:56,890
You're in a convoy...

1139
01:44:56,891 --> 01:45:00,094
...someone or something gets in front
of you, you do not stop.

1140
01:45:00,095 --> 01:45:06,404
You stop, shitheads pop up
with RPG's and kill you all dead.

1141
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:20,939
First week in Iraq...

1142
01:45:21,283 --> 01:45:23,851
...we're driving downrange.

1143
01:45:23,853 --> 01:45:26,054
Six of us in the back.

1144
01:45:26,055 --> 01:45:29,358
You can't see squat back there.

1145
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:32,951
Doc hit something.

1146
01:45:34,762 --> 01:45:38,338
We hear it thump around underneath.

1147
01:45:39,667 --> 01:45:41,430
He stops.

1148
01:45:41,604 --> 01:45:43,332
Gets out.

1149
01:45:44,506 --> 01:45:46,337
Drives on.

1150
01:45:48,476 --> 01:45:50,206
Not a word.

1151
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:55,182
Later, some guy said...

1152
01:45:55,251 --> 01:45:57,115
...we hit a kid.

1153
01:45:57,653 --> 01:45:59,782
I don't believe it.

1154
01:45:59,921 --> 01:46:01,947
You ask me...

1155
01:46:03,958 --> 01:46:05,823
...we hit a dog.

1156
01:46:07,930 --> 01:46:10,023
We killed a dog.

1157
01:46:13,534 --> 01:46:16,408
I don't know what that is.

1158
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:20,699
No fucking idea.

1159
01:46:46,402 --> 01:46:49,804
Hey, Bonner, there's your family.

1160
01:46:49,805 --> 01:46:52,172
- Stop fucking around!
- It's a fucking phone.

1161
01:46:52,173 --> 01:46:55,009
- You could have broken it.
- You're a fucking idiot.

1162
01:46:55,010 --> 01:46:56,065
Oh, fuck.

1163
01:46:56,979 --> 01:46:59,514
- Oh, shit.
- Do not stop! Do not fucking stop!

1164
01:46:59,515 --> 01:47:03,490
- What do I do?
- Speed up! Speed up!

1165
01:47:10,859 --> 01:47:13,360
- What are you doing?
- Dad?

1166
01:47:13,362 --> 01:47:16,096
Get back in the fucking vehicle, Mike!

1167
01:47:16,097 --> 01:47:19,266
Mike, get back in the fucking vehicle!

1168
01:47:19,268 --> 01:47:20,701
Daddy?

1169
01:47:28,077 --> 01:47:31,136
Let's go, Mike, now!

1170
01:47:31,913 --> 01:47:34,144
Are you there, Daddy?

1171
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:37,136
I can hardly hear you.

1172
01:47:38,619 --> 01:47:41,751
You gotta get me out of here.

1173
01:47:42,457 --> 01:47:45,862
Well, that's just nerves talking.

1174
01:47:47,363 --> 01:47:49,854
Something happened, Dad.

1175
01:47:59,041 --> 01:48:01,012
For Christ's sake.

1176
01:48:03,945 --> 01:48:06,676
Is anybody there with you?

1177
01:48:08,417 --> 01:48:10,045
No, I'm alone.

1178
01:48:13,622 --> 01:48:15,145
That's good.

1179
01:48:16,992 --> 01:48:19,789
Okay, Daddy, I gotta go.

1180
01:48:21,997 --> 01:48:23,896
You be safe, son.

1181
01:48:24,065 --> 01:48:25,795
Stay safe.

1182
01:48:27,168 --> 01:48:30,002
Yeah. You too.

1183
01:48:59,134 --> 01:49:03,503
You know, my son's been driving me crazy
ever since you came over.

1184
01:49:03,505 --> 01:49:05,769
He wants a slingshot.

1185
01:49:10,311 --> 01:49:14,945
Guess it could be worse.
Could be a BB gun.

1186
01:49:40,676 --> 01:49:41,818
Thank you.

1187
01:51:34,088 --> 01:51:37,658
So every day,
Goliath would walk into the valley...

1188
01:51:37,658 --> 01:51:41,185
...to challenge someone, anyone.

1189
01:51:41,863 --> 01:51:44,751
But no one would fight him.

1190
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:47,167
Until David showed up...

1191
01:51:47,168 --> 01:51:50,171
...and said, "You know what?
I'll do it. I'll fight him."

1192
01:51:50,171 --> 01:51:54,175
So the king dressed David up
in his own armor, which was so big...

1193
01:51:54,176 --> 01:51:58,309
But why would he let him fight a giant?

1194
01:51:58,512 --> 01:52:00,555
He was just a boy.

1195
01:52:03,284 --> 01:52:05,930
I don't know, sweetheart.

1196
01:52:07,389 --> 01:52:10,277
Do you think he was scared?

1197
01:52:10,759 --> 01:52:11,783
David?

1198
01:52:17,733 --> 01:52:19,359
Yeah.

1199
01:52:19,667 --> 01:52:23,902
I think he would have been really scared.

1200
01:53:13,721 --> 01:53:16,756
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

1201
01:53:16,757 --> 01:53:18,902
It looks really old.

1202
01:53:19,694 --> 01:53:21,909
It's been well used.

1203
01:53:32,239 --> 01:53:34,274
And I shouldn't take it down at night?

1204
01:53:34,275 --> 01:53:35,833
No.

1205
01:53:37,445 --> 01:53:40,420
You leave it just like that.

1206
01:53:41,248 --> 01:53:43,463
That's a lot easier.
