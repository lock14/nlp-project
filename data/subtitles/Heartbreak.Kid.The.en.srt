I don't want you to.

18
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:59,301
Yes, you do.

Happiness and peace.
Amen.

You know it, honey.

Honey, don't do this.
I can't shift if you do that.

75
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,539
Honey, don't, don't.
Don't do this, honey.

You're not married to the truck drivers.

00:10:23,271 --> 00:10:25,506
Hmm?
I like to.

104
00:10:25,574 --> 00:10:29,577
I know you like to. I have
an incredibly sensitive chest, though.

105
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:36,550

106
00:10:36,618 --> 00:10:41,255
No, really, come on.
Nothing, stupid chest.

107
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:45,876

- No, honey, don't do it.

mouth when they don't want it.

- Double chocolate shake, right?

00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:44,501
It felt really terrific. It's just...

175
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:48,906
I don't understand why I have
to announce it all the time.

176
00:16:48,973 --> 00:16:53,760
You don't have to announce it
all the time. Just tell me.

177
00:16:53,828 --> 00:16:57,614
I have to be reassured.
What's wrong with that?

178
00:16:57,682 --> 00:17:02,369
It's difficult to give out bulletins
in the heat of passion.

179
00:17:02,436 --> 00:17:05,405
You hardly said a word
to me all night.

180
00:17:05,473 --> 00:17:08,525
I'm always quiet at night.

181
00:17:08,593 --> 00:17:11,045
You were never quiet
before we were married.

182
00:17:11,112 --> 00:17:13,247
We never made love
before we were married!

183
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:16,900
We fooled around a little,
but this is all new.

184
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,709
It's all new to me too.

185
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:33,500
You're gonna have to give me
about 40 or 50 years.

186
00:17:33,568 --> 00:17:36,319
Why do you keep saying 40 or 50 years?
We're on our honeymoon.

187
00:17:36,387 --> 00:17:39,273
I mean, we're not even out
of Georgia yet.

188
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:44,311
Look at Mr. grouch!

189
00:17:46,514 --> 00:17:49,733
"Mommy, mommy, help me.

190
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:53,119
I married a grouch."

191
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,017
You all right?

192
00:18:19,113 --> 00:18:21,047
Mm-hmm.

193
00:18:33,477 --> 00:18:35,111

Hi, Miami beach.

199
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,743
Miami beach, hello!

200
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:09,730
Here we come, Miami beach!

201
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:23,026
Paging Max Doogan.
Come to the front desk, please.

202
00:19:42,363 --> 00:19:45,349
Thank you very much.
Have a nice day.

203
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:48,101
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.

204
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,098

207
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:20,050
We go down now, we can get
a whole afternoon of sun in.

208
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:23,503
Wait just two seconds.
Just two seconds.

209
00:20:23,571 --> 00:20:26,656
Just two seconds.

210
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:52,282
Give me, give me two seconds.

211
00:20:58,689 --> 00:21:01,124
Listen, I'll meet you down there, okay?

212
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:10,267
- I'll meet you down in about ten minutes, okay?
- Okay.

213
00:21:56,597 --> 00:21:58,615
That's my spot.

214
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:06,556
<i>What? Excuse me?</i>

215
00:22:06,624 --> 00:22:10,661
I said, you're lying in my spot.

216
00:22:13,898 --> 00:22:16,166
This is your spot?

217
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:19,586
<i>- Everybody knows that.
- I didn't know--</i>

218
00:22:19,654 --> 00:22:23,657
I just got here.
I didn't, uh-- I'll move.

219
00:22:23,725 --> 00:22:26,944
<i>I just got here.</i>

220
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:30,047
Never mind.
Just don't do it again.

221
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:53,186
Lenny?

222
00:22:53,254 --> 00:22:55,288
Lenny!

223
00:23:00,978 --> 00:23:03,447
Len?

224
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:08,969
Lenny, come on!

225
00:23:15,793 --> 00:23:18,295
- Come on!
- Be right up.

226
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:21,548
What are you looking at?

227
00:23:36,731 --> 00:23:38,565
No, no.

228
00:23:38,633 --> 00:23:41,034
The sun's hot, honey.

229
00:23:42,453 --> 00:23:45,472
I just wanna get a little tan.

230
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:50,210
You've already been out an hour.
That's a lot the first day.

231
00:23:50,294 --> 00:23:53,296
I know when I've had enough.

232
00:24:01,238 --> 00:24:04,274
Ooh, it's hot! It's hot.
You feel like a dip?

233
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:07,677
You know I can't swim.

234
00:24:07,745 --> 00:24:10,681
You can't swim?
I didn't know that.

235
00:24:10,748 --> 00:24:13,533
You did too.

236
00:24:13,601 --> 00:24:15,936
How would I know that?
I've never been to the beach with you.

237
00:24:16,003 --> 00:24:18,788
Well...

238
00:24:18,856 --> 00:24:22,175
I guess that's another thing
you just found out about me.

239
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:23,877
Hey!

240
00:24:23,944 --> 00:24:26,746
Oh! I'm so sorry.
Did I get you wet?

241
00:24:26,814 --> 00:24:29,049
- No, that's okay.
- I'm really sorry.

242
00:24:29,117 --> 00:24:31,968
- That's okay.
- I didn't mean to.

243
00:24:40,878 --> 00:24:42,845
Who's she?

244
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,215
I don't know.

245
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,837
Is she staying here?

246
00:24:50,905 --> 00:24:53,790
I don't know.

247
00:24:53,857 --> 00:24:55,992
Think she's attractive?

248
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,679
No!

249
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:04,935
I warned you.
Didn't I warn you, Lila?

250
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:08,972
- Didn't I say, "Lila, you're getting too much sun"?
- Ow!

251
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,007
Didn't I say that?

252
00:25:12,392 --> 00:25:15,779
I just wanted to get a nice tan.

253
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:19,749
- I'm sorry.
- Well, it's too late now.

254
00:25:19,817 --> 00:25:22,903
You're gonna puff up
like a basketball.

255
00:25:22,971 --> 00:25:26,806
- Ow, ow, ow.
- I mean, here it is, our honeymoon.

256
00:25:26,874 --> 00:25:31,028
I thought we would go to the dog races;
I thought we would go to jai alai.

257
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:34,831
I thought we would see some
of the big shows in the big hotels.

258
00:25:34,898 --> 00:25:36,933
Instead, we're gonna sit
in a hotel room.

259
00:25:37,001 --> 00:25:40,453
- Oww!
- You're gonna puff up. I'm gonna watch television.

260
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:42,922
I won't puff up.

261
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:47,160
I'll put some stuff on that stops you
from puffing up.

262
00:25:47,228 --> 00:25:49,162
There's no such thing as that!

263
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:52,582
They haven't invented anything like that!
You're gonna puff up!

264
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:56,553
You're not gonna be a normal person
till Wednesday or Thursday.

265
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,955
You could be
a little more sympathetic.

266
00:26:00,758 --> 00:26:03,259
I'm going down to the bar
for a bottle of beer.

267
00:26:03,327 --> 00:26:05,812
Where are you going?

268
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:10,216
I'm going down to the bar
for a bottle of beer.

269
00:26:10,284 --> 00:26:13,937
- When will you be back?
- When I finish my bottle of beer!

270
00:26:14,004 --> 00:26:17,356
It's our first night in Florida.

271
00:26:17,424 --> 00:26:20,777
What difference what night it is?
I'm thirsty!

272
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,596
Turn the television on.

273
00:26:23,664 --> 00:26:26,649
I'll come back after my beer.

274
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,882
How's it goin'?

275
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,218
It's Miami.

276
00:26:45,302 --> 00:26:47,570
I know what you mean.

277
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,126
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.

278
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,933
<i>That's my stool.</i>

279
00:27:21,505 --> 00:27:23,439
Hi.

280
00:27:25,542 --> 00:27:28,378
Did he say you could sit in my stool?

281
00:27:28,445 --> 00:27:32,015
I didn't know it was your stool.
Would you like it back?

282
00:27:33,434 --> 00:27:35,969
I'll let you know when I do.

283
00:27:37,905 --> 00:27:40,140
You a guest at this hotel?

284
00:27:40,207 --> 00:27:43,192
Is that what this is?

285
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:53,053
I just got in today.
I'm Len Cantrow.

286
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,705
No kidding?

287
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,880
Can I get you a drink?

288
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:07,901
No.

289
00:28:07,969 --> 00:28:10,736
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

290
00:28:10,804 --> 00:28:13,356
Come on, Kelly.
They're waiting for us.

291
00:28:13,424 --> 00:28:16,126
Reservations were 8:30.

292
00:28:23,217 --> 00:28:25,918
<i>Gonna be on the beach tomorrow?</i>

293
00:28:25,986 --> 00:28:28,421
Oh, yeah, sure.

294
00:28:29,473 --> 00:28:32,358
In the morning?

295
00:28:32,426 --> 00:28:34,961
Yeah, I don't even have breakfast.
I just have some juice.

296
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:37,780
I'll put on my trunks,
and I'm down there.

297
00:28:37,848 --> 00:28:40,550
Just make sure
you stay off my spot.

298
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:45,571
Thanks for the nut.

299
00:28:51,512 --> 00:28:54,214
Did you meet anyone at the bar?

300
00:28:54,282 --> 00:28:56,249
What?

301
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:59,569
I said, did you meet anyone
at the bar?

302
00:29:01,155 --> 00:29:05,158
Who would I meet at the bar?
There's just a bunch of jerks here.

303
00:29:05,226 --> 00:29:09,462
- I don't know.
- You were gone so long. I thought, maybe--

304
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:11,497
like you were talking
to someone at the bar.

305
00:29:11,565 --> 00:29:16,652
No, they don't even get a crowd
until midnight. I was, I was alone.

306
00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:21,391
I put cream on.

307
00:29:22,609 --> 00:29:24,610
It doesn't hurt so much anymore.

308
00:29:24,678 --> 00:29:29,465
Maybe tomorrow I could sit in the shade
with you for a while?

309
00:29:29,533 --> 00:29:31,701
No!
You stay out of the shade.

310
00:29:31,768 --> 00:29:34,270
<i>I mean, there are sun rays in the shade.</i>

311
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,773
You have to stay in the room
all day tomorrow.

312
00:29:38,442 --> 00:29:41,178
What'll you do?

313
00:29:41,245 --> 00:29:45,615
I'll, I'll hang around the beach.
I'll look at the jerks.

314
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,185
There's a lot of paperbacks in the lobby.

315
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,121
Wait!
Where are you rushing to?

316
00:30:08,188 --> 00:30:13,176
<i>Nowhere.
I'm not rushing anywhere.</i>

317
00:30:13,243 --> 00:30:17,380
Just who would want to spend
a beautiful day like this in bed?

318
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:20,283
Want me to call room service,

319
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:25,205
order you some breakfast
or coffee or something?

320
00:30:25,273 --> 00:30:27,407
I can do it myself.

321
00:30:27,474 --> 00:30:30,927
Yeah, call room service,
order anything you want.

322
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,713
I'll keep checking with you all day long.

323
00:30:33,781 --> 00:30:36,182
You know something? The best thing
I could do is leave you alone...

324
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:40,320
Because the only thing
that's gonna help you is time.

325
00:30:40,388 --> 00:30:44,040
<i>- And cream.
- Cream and time.</i>

326
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:46,626
Lenny?

327
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,768
If I look better by tonight,
could we go out someplace for dinner?

328
00:30:55,836 --> 00:30:59,055
Absolutely. Anything you wanna do,
we're gonna do it, okay?

329
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:01,057
Anything you want, that's what we'll do.

330
00:31:01,124 --> 00:31:05,461
Just take care of yourself, and I'll, uh--
I'll check with you all day.

331
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:08,447
The important thing is that I get outta here.
I'll leave you alone.

332
00:31:08,515 --> 00:31:11,568
You'll be better off.
Really.

333
00:31:11,635 --> 00:31:13,769
Okay?
Oh!

334
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:18,007
Hot! It's so hot out here. You're so lucky
you have an air-conditioned room.

335
00:31:18,075 --> 00:31:20,309
It's so hot out here.
Okay.

336
00:31:21,528 --> 00:31:23,930
Excuse me.

337
00:31:23,997 --> 00:31:25,932
I'm sorry, excuse me.

338
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,719
He's crazy.
He's in such a rush. He's crazy.

339
00:31:53,961 --> 00:31:57,446
I didn't know they allowed Teddy bears
on the beach.

340
00:31:57,481 --> 00:31:59,749
I didn't see any signs.

341
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:04,604
They're not allowed!
So just stay off the beach.

342
00:32:19,136 --> 00:32:21,137
Ahh!

343
00:32:21,204 --> 00:32:24,357
Whoa. You are this terrific girl!

344
00:32:24,425 --> 00:32:27,410
You are this terrific--

345
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:30,180
what a terrific girl you are!

346
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:34,317
I didn't know Teddy bears could talk.

347
00:32:34,384 --> 00:32:36,652
Hey, where'd you get that laugh?

348
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,305
My father bought it for me.

349
00:32:39,372 --> 00:32:41,807
We're very rich.

350
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:53,369
Oh!

351
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:59,909
Last one to shore buys the cokes.

352
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:10,753
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a second.

353
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,207
I think I should tell you.

354
00:33:14,275 --> 00:33:18,027
That girl I was with yesterday?

355
00:33:18,095 --> 00:33:22,815
Miss? That girl I was with
yesterday is my wife.

356
00:33:22,883 --> 00:33:25,251
I'm on my honeymoon.

357
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:28,704
I just got married three days ago.

358
00:33:28,772 --> 00:33:31,857
<i>So what else is new?</i>

359
00:33:31,925 --> 00:33:34,644
What else is new?

360
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:37,764
What else is new?

361
00:33:40,301 --> 00:33:43,002
<i>Minnesota? I mean,
what do you want to live...</i>

362
00:33:43,069 --> 00:33:46,155
in a dumb place like Minnesota for?
- What's wrong with Minnesota?

363
00:33:46,223 --> 00:33:48,641
I mean,
it's so far from New York.

364
00:33:48,709 --> 00:33:52,394
Well, if you and your cute little wife
are ever driving through,

365
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:54,397
stop in and say hello.

366
00:33:56,116 --> 00:33:59,269
Is there another name
that goes with Kelly?

367
00:33:59,336 --> 00:34:00,937
Corcoran.

368
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,573
Kelly Corcoran.
That figures.

369
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,610
A girl like you is gonna have a name
like Kelly Corcoran.

370
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:10,746
What's your cute little wife's name?

371
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:12,382
Lila.

372
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:14,467
Lila?

373
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,837
Lila.

374
00:34:17,905 --> 00:34:19,922
Does Lila come when you call her?

375
00:34:20,007 --> 00:34:22,741
No. She's okay.

376
00:34:22,809 --> 00:34:25,828
<i>What's that ring for?</i>

377
00:34:27,214 --> 00:34:29,448
It holds my finger on.
I've got leprosy.

378
00:34:35,822 --> 00:34:37,990
<i>That's funny.</i>

379
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:47,433
I like your hair down.
It gives you a Teddy bear look.

380
00:34:50,654 --> 00:34:52,888
Does it bother you if I do that?

381
00:34:56,794 --> 00:35:00,597
- You can do anything you like.
- Anything?

382
00:35:02,482 --> 00:35:04,784
I think you're ready for my test.

383
00:35:05,769 --> 00:35:07,536
Test?
You have a test?

384
00:35:07,604 --> 00:35:10,306
Terrific!

385
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:13,292
Give me your arm.

386
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,481
Just relax.

387
00:35:18,548 --> 00:35:23,252
It's my own special scratch test,

388
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,357
only given to certain
selective individuals.

389
00:35:29,592 --> 00:35:31,694
Relax!

390
00:35:31,761 --> 00:35:34,614
Relax your fingers.

391
00:35:34,682 --> 00:35:38,784
Kelly! Come on, honey, it's 3:00.
Let's go, huh?

392
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:44,206
Sure, dad. I'll be there in just a minute.
Okay? Go ahead.

393
00:35:44,274 --> 00:35:47,527
I promise.
Be right there.

394
00:35:57,687 --> 00:36:00,440
- Well, thanks for the coke.
- Wait a minute.

395
00:36:00,507 --> 00:36:02,875
- Where are you going in the middle of a beautiful day?
- We're checking out.

396
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:05,544
You're checking out today?

397
00:36:05,612 --> 00:36:08,597
Daddy doesn't like this place.
He doesn't like the element you get here.

398
00:36:08,665 --> 00:36:11,184
We're moving to the Jockey Club
until Saturday.

399
00:36:11,251 --> 00:36:13,453
Wait a second. I've gotta see you
one more time.

400
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,706
- I've gotta prove something to myself.
- We're moving to the Jockey Club.

401
00:36:16,773 --> 00:36:21,643
Can I see you there? Can I meet you
for a drink? I'll come over like 7:00.

402
00:36:21,711 --> 00:36:24,931
We're going to the Fontainebleau tonight
with some Colorado people.

403
00:36:24,999 --> 00:36:29,401
I could come over.
I'll stop over for a drink at 7:00.

404
00:36:29,469 --> 00:36:35,241
- What about your cute little wife?
- It's okay. A drink at 7:00.

405
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:39,479
Well, if Lila won't let you,
you can have my spot on the beach.

406
00:36:46,453 --> 00:36:48,821
But you said we could go out for dinner
if the swelling went down.

407
00:36:48,889 --> 00:36:52,425
We are. We're going out for dinner.
I already made reservations.

408
00:36:52,493 --> 00:36:57,496
9:00 for two.
The best seafood place on the beach.

409
00:36:57,564 --> 00:37:02,618
Just have to have this drink with this
old army buddy of mine first, honey.

410
00:37:02,686 --> 00:37:06,271
Imagine running into him
on the beach like that.

411
00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:09,492
Is it so important?

412
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:14,714
Important? He only saved my life.
That's all.

413
00:37:14,781 --> 00:37:19,435
He pulled me out of a burning barracks
in Louisiana in the middle of the night.

414
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:22,755
He pulled six of us out...
And the captain.

415
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:26,642
Got a citation.

416
00:37:26,709 --> 00:37:28,744
What's his name?

417
00:37:28,812 --> 00:37:31,147
His name?
Wilmer McCrady.

418
00:37:31,214 --> 00:37:34,466
He's a big rednecked jerk when
it comes to having a conversation.

419
00:37:34,534 --> 00:37:39,822
But he's a hell of a handy guy to have around
if you're gonna need somebody to save your life.

420
00:37:39,889 --> 00:37:42,308
He's a big beer drinker.

421
00:37:42,376 --> 00:37:47,797
I almost didn't even recognize him.
Must've put on about 30 pounds.

422
00:37:47,864 --> 00:37:52,501
He's got a charter fishing boat
business here. Married.

423
00:37:52,569 --> 00:37:57,490
- Three kids.
- Why, why can't the wives come?

424
00:37:57,558 --> 00:38:01,010
What?
To an army reunion?

425
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:04,947
Honey, are you kidding?
Do you know what the language would get like?

426
00:38:05,014 --> 00:38:08,568
This is a very rough guy.

427
00:38:08,635 --> 00:38:11,303
He's always got a toothpick in his mouth.

428
00:38:14,591 --> 00:38:19,545
Look, set your appetite dial
for a quarter to 9:00...

429
00:38:19,613 --> 00:38:24,249
For that terrific Florida lobster...

430
00:38:24,317 --> 00:38:28,805
And that yummy yum-yum pecan pie.

431
00:38:28,872 --> 00:38:30,923
Okay?

432
00:38:31,007 --> 00:38:33,342
Okay?

433
00:38:33,409 --> 00:38:38,630
- You won't forget me?
- Oh, honey, come on. How can I forget you?

434
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:42,018
No, I didn't exaggerate.

435
00:38:58,151 --> 00:39:01,236
Would you excuse me?

436
00:39:01,304 --> 00:39:04,357
Bye, dad, I'll be back. Bye.

437
00:39:15,435 --> 00:39:18,171
How'd you get away
from your cute little wife?

438
00:39:18,238 --> 00:39:20,723
It's no problem.
I can handle that.

439
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:24,042
I know I wouldn't
let you get away with it.

440
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:29,464
You know, perhaps that's why I'm here.

441
00:39:29,532 --> 00:39:32,552
Uh, scotch.

442
00:39:38,842 --> 00:39:41,861
Here's the deal.
The marriage is off.

443
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,398
<i>It was just one of those dumb things
i rushed into,</i>

444
00:39:46,466 --> 00:39:48,400
like joining the army, except...

445
00:39:48,468 --> 00:39:52,421
this time I'm not gonna
wait around three years to get out.

446
00:39:52,506 --> 00:39:56,092
I had my doubts in Virginia.

447
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:59,144
I was pretty sure in Georgia.

448
00:39:59,212 --> 00:40:03,916
You have...
really settled things for me in Florida.

449
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:11,507
I've been waiting for a girl
like you all my life.

450
00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:15,161
I just timed it wrong.

451
00:40:17,947 --> 00:40:21,300
Here's the plan.
I'm definitely getting out.

452
00:40:21,367 --> 00:40:26,888
I just have to figure a way
to let her down easy.

453
00:40:26,956 --> 00:40:30,042
It kinda complicates things,

454
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:33,812
this being our honeymoon
and everything, you know?

455
00:40:37,267 --> 00:40:40,352
What do you think about
what I've said so far?

456
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,355
I'm just listening.

457
00:40:42,422 --> 00:40:46,792
Can't think if I'm listening.

458
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:51,530
You have a fantastic way
of putting things. It really kills me.

459
00:40:54,484 --> 00:40:57,737
I need some time...

460
00:40:57,804 --> 00:41:01,957
Because it's a little difficult.

461
00:41:02,025 --> 00:41:06,978
I have to figure out a way to drop
the bombshell on the poor kid, you know?

462
00:41:07,046 --> 00:41:10,833
- When are you gonna go back to Minnesota?
- Saturday.

463
00:41:12,435 --> 00:41:15,721
- Saturday. The day after tomorrow?
- Uh-huh.

464
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:21,744
I really have my work cut out for me.
There's all the wedding presents.

465
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:25,247
You just make your own decision.
We're leaving on Saturday.

466
00:41:25,314 --> 00:41:30,937
Don't underestimate me.
I'm in this all the way. What about you?

467
00:41:31,004 --> 00:41:34,023
Um, I've got to get back to the table.

468
00:41:35,442 --> 00:41:39,161
That look in your eye
is good enough for me.

469
00:41:40,897 --> 00:41:43,198
Would you like to come over
and say hello?

470
00:41:43,266 --> 00:41:45,201
No, I can't. I gotta get back.

471
00:41:45,268 --> 00:41:47,370
It's all right. I told daddy about you.

472
00:41:47,437 --> 00:41:51,090
- You did? About my being married?
- Not about that yet.

473
00:41:51,174 --> 00:41:54,927
- But he's seen me talking to you.
- Oh, yeah. What does he think?

474
00:41:54,995 --> 00:41:58,997
He hasn't met you yet, but just
from appearances, he doesn't like you.

475
00:41:59,065 --> 00:42:01,433
Appearances aren't everything.

476
00:42:01,501 --> 00:42:05,437
<i>Kelly, how long are you gonna be?
They're waiting with the lobster bisque.</i>

477
00:42:05,505 --> 00:42:08,074
I was just coming.
Daddy, this is Mr. Cantrow.

478
00:42:08,141 --> 00:42:10,076
Cantrow. Hello, sir.
A real pleasure.

479
00:42:10,143 --> 00:42:13,596
I'm sorry I detained your daughter.
I hope I didn't interrupt your dinner.

480
00:42:13,663 --> 00:42:15,965
Come on, Kelly.
Your mother's a nervous wreck.

481
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,818
Daddy, is it all right if Mr. Cantrow
joins us for dinner? Please, daddy.

482
00:42:18,885 --> 00:42:22,337
No, no, really, I can't. That's very generous.
Thank you very much.

483
00:42:22,405 --> 00:42:25,324
Perhaps some other time
we can have dinner together.

484
00:42:25,391 --> 00:42:28,044
Why not? You can drop
your bombs later, can't you?

485
00:42:28,111 --> 00:42:32,264
- Kelly, he said no.
- He'll come if I ask him to.

486
00:42:32,332 --> 00:42:35,317
No. I really have
a very pressing appointment.

487
00:42:35,385 --> 00:42:37,753
Maybe just a fruit cocktail.

488
00:43:06,783 --> 00:43:09,601
- Can you see all right, Kelly?
- Perfect, daddy.

489
00:43:09,669 --> 00:43:11,837
Fine, sir.

490
00:43:37,013 --> 00:43:40,299
Oh!

491
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:43,452
Oh, what a terrific show!

492
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,389
Oh, yes, he is very funny, isn't he?

493
00:43:50,193 --> 00:43:52,461
You like the show, Kelly?

494
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:55,447
- Terrific, daddy.
- Most enjoyable, sir.

495
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:03,856
<i>- Oh, Emma.
- Yes, Charles?</i>

496
00:44:05,592 --> 00:44:07,860
<i>Do you find me unattractively plain?</i>

497
00:44:07,928 --> 00:44:10,595
<i>No, Charles.</i>

498
00:44:10,663 --> 00:44:15,984
<i>I always thought you had a most noble
forehead, and a most attractive manner.</i>

499
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:20,038
We have a subscription
to the Minneapolis Symphony.

500
00:44:20,106 --> 00:44:23,742
- Don't we, Duane?
- Is that right, sir?

501
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:26,828
We had Leonard Bernstein last year.

502
00:44:26,896 --> 00:44:30,816
I must've seen Leonard Bernstein
maybe 200, 300 times.

503
00:44:30,883 --> 00:44:36,588
Oh! Listen, if you're ever around Minneapolis,
be sure and go and see them.

504
00:44:36,656 --> 00:44:38,857
You'd just love it. I know.

505
00:44:38,925 --> 00:44:43,962
As a matter of fact, I may be heading in
that direction in the very near future.

506
00:44:44,047 --> 00:44:46,816
- Oh, how nice!
- Well.

507
00:44:46,883 --> 00:44:49,317
Isn't that nice, Duane?

508
00:44:51,454 --> 00:44:54,673
What business did you say
you were in, young man?

509
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,675
Athletic equipment, sir.

510
00:44:57,928 --> 00:45:00,412
What?

511
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,965
Athletic equipment. Sporting goods.

512
00:45:04,033 --> 00:45:06,986
Oh, I see. You mean...

513
00:45:07,053 --> 00:45:09,354
you sell balls and bats, huh?

514
00:45:09,422 --> 00:45:11,857
That what you mean, balls and bats?

515
00:45:11,924 --> 00:45:17,179
Last year in this country,
over $2 billion were spent on recreation.

516
00:45:17,246 --> 00:45:21,250
Is that right? On balls and bats?

517
00:45:21,317 --> 00:45:25,487
Duane, if we're gonna shove off
at 7:00 tomorrow morning,

518
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:28,574
...we better get in a little bed time.
- Yes, I guess we better.

519
00:45:28,641 --> 00:45:30,776
Waiter?

520
00:45:30,844 --> 00:45:33,078
No, no.
This is on me.

521
00:45:33,146 --> 00:45:35,614
No, no, let me get it.

522
00:45:35,681 --> 00:45:38,801
Captain, can you find
our waiter for us, please?

523
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:41,887
Mr. Cantrow, I hope
we meet again very soon.

524
00:45:41,955 --> 00:45:44,740
- Cantrow, mother.
- I'm sorry.

525
00:45:44,807 --> 00:45:47,993
And you'll be seeing him tomorrow.
He's going fishing with us.

526
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:49,979
Tomorrow?

527
00:45:50,046 --> 00:45:51,981
Isn't it all right, daddy?

528
00:45:54,634 --> 00:45:57,603
It's his boat.

529
00:45:57,671 --> 00:46:00,289
We can always use an extra hand.
We shove off at 7:00.

530
00:46:00,356 --> 00:46:03,642
Thank you very much.

531
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:06,528
- I can't go tomorrow.
- Bel Harbor Yacht Club, 7:00.

532
00:46:06,595 --> 00:46:09,631
How can I go tomorrow?
I can't go tomorrow.

533
00:46:13,903 --> 00:46:15,971
Bombs away.

534
00:46:22,345 --> 00:46:25,331
Lila? Lila? You up?

535
00:46:25,398 --> 00:46:27,465
- What do you want?
- Did you hear?

536
00:46:27,533 --> 00:46:30,001
Did you hear?
Did you watch the news?

537
00:46:30,069 --> 00:46:34,373
We were in a big accident!
Wilmer was driving me here about 8:30...

538
00:46:34,441 --> 00:46:37,459
When a big oil truck
plowed right into us.

539
00:46:37,527 --> 00:46:41,296
I'm all right. I just got shaken up a little.
I had my seat belt on.

540
00:46:41,364 --> 00:46:46,501
But the truck is still burning
and Wilmer's caris a complete wreck.

541
00:46:46,586 --> 00:46:49,521
A complete wreck!

542
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:52,107
They checked me over at Miami general.

543
00:46:52,175 --> 00:46:55,010
I'm all right. I don't want you to worry.
I'm perfectly all right.

544
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:58,397
I didn't hear anything about any accident.

545
00:46:58,481 --> 00:47:03,685
That surprises me, 'cause there were
reporters all over the place.

546
00:47:03,753 --> 00:47:07,389
The oil companies must've
paid them off to keep quiet.

547
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:09,892
My back is a little sore.

548
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,978
Wilmer may lose some teeth.
They're not sure yet.

549
00:47:13,046 --> 00:47:15,214
The truck plowed right into us!

550
00:47:15,282 --> 00:47:17,216
Incredible!

551
00:47:17,284 --> 00:47:19,985
What wilmer does have
is a terrific lawsuit...

552
00:47:20,052 --> 00:47:23,488
because there were
ten, fifteen witnesses.

553
00:47:23,556 --> 00:47:26,224
I have to be in court tomorrow at 7:00.

554
00:47:26,292 --> 00:47:30,246
7:00?
What courts open at 7:00?

555
00:47:30,313 --> 00:47:33,031
Florida courts open at 7:00
'cause of the weather down here.

556
00:47:33,099 --> 00:47:37,102
No use you coming because I'm gonna
be signing affidavits all day long.

557
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:39,137
My back is really sore.

558
00:47:39,205 --> 00:47:42,958
I sat here all night.
You could've called me.

559
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:46,044
Honey, how could I call?
I was pinned behind--

560
00:47:46,112 --> 00:47:49,949
I was pinned in a '68 Chevy.
It took them an hour to get us out.

561
00:47:50,016 --> 00:47:52,034
How could I call you?

562
00:47:54,287 --> 00:47:57,255
Were you really in an accident?

563
00:47:59,959 --> 00:48:02,227
You think I'm making it up?

564
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,697
My God!

565
00:48:05,765 --> 00:48:09,184
My God! You think I'm making it up?

566
00:48:09,252 --> 00:48:11,954
I'll get the patrolman
who pulled me out of the car.

567
00:48:12,021 --> 00:48:15,591
Talk to patrolman Greer,
the man that pulled me out of the car.

568
00:48:15,658 --> 00:48:19,311
- I didn't mean it. My God!
- Lila, I'm lucky I'm alive!

569
00:48:19,379 --> 00:48:23,615
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean you were making it up.

570
00:48:57,017 --> 00:49:00,936
- Good night, Lila.
- Good night, Lenny.

571
00:50:02,698 --> 00:50:05,951
Ah, thanks for waiting.

572
00:50:08,521 --> 00:50:12,791
Nice to be aboard.
Nice to be aboard.

573
00:50:22,385 --> 00:50:26,755
- Happy?
- Happy?

574
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:30,709
It's only the best three days of my life.

575
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:34,279
I think we'll come back here
on our honeymoon.

576
00:50:34,347 --> 00:50:37,015
What makes you so sure
there's going to be a honeymoon?

577
00:50:37,082 --> 00:50:39,701
I told you. Don't underestimate me.

578
00:50:39,769 --> 00:50:43,488
Don't underestimate daddy.
He still doesn't like you.

579
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:49,177
- If he told you to drop me, what would you do?
- Drop you.

580
00:50:54,567 --> 00:50:57,218
You always do what your father says?

581
00:50:57,286 --> 00:50:59,587
Always.

582
00:50:59,622 --> 00:51:01,823
Kelly, what do you say?
Lunch.

583
00:51:01,891 --> 00:51:04,876
- I'm coming, daddy.
- Be right there, sir.

584
00:51:07,213 --> 00:51:10,632
Okay, listen.
Tonight at your hotel, 7:00.

585
00:51:10,699 --> 00:51:12,801
Your father and me over cocktails.

586
00:51:12,868 --> 00:51:16,538
- I lay my cards on the table.
He finds out I mean business.
- Yeah?

587
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:19,891
- Yeah.
- Well, anyway, it's been a terrific three days.

588
00:51:19,959 --> 00:51:24,730
Three days? Wait till you get a load
of the next 40 or 50 years.

589
00:51:28,634 --> 00:51:32,287
<i>Be right there.
Hold the elevator.</i>

590
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:36,257
- Hi, hon.
- I want an explanation.

591
00:51:36,325 --> 00:51:41,062
- What?
- I said to you that I want an explanation.

592
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:44,115
What kind of an explanation?

593
00:51:45,985 --> 00:51:48,854
I'd like to know how you got
such a gorgeous tan...

594
00:51:48,938 --> 00:51:52,790
If you've been in court
since 7:00 this morning.

595
00:51:52,858 --> 00:51:57,228
Oh, honey, do you think
the law moves that quickly?

596
00:51:57,296 --> 00:51:59,397
I mean, in Florida?

597
00:51:59,465 --> 00:52:02,083
There were three cases before us.

598
00:52:02,151 --> 00:52:05,053
Then they had a recess.

599
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:08,623
And then I wasn't called
as a material witness until 2:30.

600
00:52:08,691 --> 00:52:12,277
And all that time I was sitting on
the dumb hot courtroom steps.

601
00:52:12,345 --> 00:52:15,496
It was a complete waste of a day.

602
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:25,490
Do you call this a honeymoon?

603
00:52:25,558 --> 00:52:30,345
Do you know that I haven't seen you for
five minutes since we've been in Florida?

604
00:52:30,412 --> 00:52:34,916
Oh, honey, it's not the amount of time
you spend with somebody.

605
00:52:34,984 --> 00:52:37,152
It's how the time was spent.

606
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:41,990
And I feel that I'll...
Never forget these three days.

607
00:52:47,379 --> 00:52:49,831
Where are you going now?

608
00:52:49,899 --> 00:52:55,220
Honey-- honey, I've got
to visit Wilmer's family.

609
00:52:55,288 --> 00:52:58,807
Wilmer keeled over signing an affidavit.

610
00:52:58,874 --> 00:53:01,826
The man has three broken ribs.

611
00:53:01,894 --> 00:53:04,763
They rushed him to the hospital.

612
00:53:04,847 --> 00:53:07,582
He's not gonna be doing much
charter fishing for a while,

613
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:12,153
so I thought I would go and lay a hundred
bucks on his wife and kids.

614
00:53:12,221 --> 00:53:14,156
Wait, can't I go with you?

615
00:53:14,223 --> 00:53:16,875
Honey, shantytown!
The man lives in shantytown.

616
00:53:16,942 --> 00:53:19,544
You can't walk through
shantytown this time of night.

617
00:53:19,612 --> 00:53:24,215
- I wouldn't want to if I didn't have to, sweetheart.
- What about dinner?

618
00:53:24,283 --> 00:53:28,970
Dinner is 9:00. Florida lobster and
a terrific Florida pecan pie.

619
00:53:29,038 --> 00:53:34,126
Something very big has come up and I think
tonight is a good time to discuss it.

620
00:53:34,193 --> 00:53:36,111
Something good?

621
00:53:36,178 --> 00:53:40,081
Could be very great. It all depends
on how you want to look at it.

622
00:53:44,486 --> 00:53:49,391
I certainly appreciate the way you
and Mrs. Corcoran have treated me.

623
00:53:49,475 --> 00:53:54,446
I mean, after all, I'm a veritable stranger,
veritably unknown.

624
00:53:54,513 --> 00:53:58,032
And you and Mrs. Corcoran
have generously treated me as though...

625
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:01,185
I were practically a member
of the immediate family.

626
00:54:01,253 --> 00:54:05,390
Kelly said something about
your laying your cards on the table.

627
00:54:05,457 --> 00:54:10,979
- Were those your cards?
- No, no, I'm just kinda shuffling.

628
00:54:11,046 --> 00:54:14,516
This is actually my deal now.

629
00:54:15,868 --> 00:54:20,739
Well, in just plain, old-fashioned,
corny lingo, sir,

630
00:54:20,806 --> 00:54:26,227
uh, I have fallen head over heels
with your Kelly here.

631
00:54:26,295 --> 00:54:30,065
It didn't take me long
to make up my mind.

632
00:54:30,132 --> 00:54:35,320
One good look did it,
actually, if you want to know the truth.

633
00:54:35,388 --> 00:54:39,391
I'm the kind of crazy hairpin that
doesn't need much more than that.

634
00:54:39,459 --> 00:54:43,378
And then, that's it for life with me.

635
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:47,915
Now, there is a slight complication.

636
00:54:47,983 --> 00:54:50,669
I happen to be a newlywed.

637
00:54:50,737 --> 00:54:52,871
Um,

638
00:54:52,938 --> 00:54:57,542
I made the big mistake
about five days ago in New York.

639
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:02,013
When I say big, sir, I mean
radio-city-music-hall big.

640
00:55:02,081 --> 00:55:06,701
You may have seen her around the pool.
She's a nice girl.

641
00:55:06,769 --> 00:55:12,123
But just not, not really my type.

642
00:55:12,191 --> 00:55:17,195
I married her because I thought it was
the decent thing to do.

643
00:55:18,664 --> 00:55:23,885
I've learned that decency
doesn't always pay off.

644
00:55:24,937 --> 00:55:28,856
So I'm going to get out.

645
00:55:28,924 --> 00:55:31,025
It'll be difficult, but not impossible.

646
00:55:31,093 --> 00:55:35,196
Not when you're as determined as I am.

647
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:39,500
Sitting opposite you,
Mr. Corcoran, is probably...

648
00:55:39,535 --> 00:55:43,871
the most determined young man
that you have ever seen.

649
00:55:46,925 --> 00:55:52,346
Now, I know that you are going back
to Minneapolis tomorrow.

650
00:55:52,414 --> 00:55:58,202
And it's my plan, just as soon as
I work out this messy business,

651
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:00,505
to follow you out to Minnesota,

652
00:56:00,572 --> 00:56:02,991
to get myself set up there,

653
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:07,228
and to lay claim
to your lovely daughter.

654
00:56:09,631 --> 00:56:12,200
Those are my cards, and, uh,

655
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:16,988
Mr. Corcoran, there's not
a joker in the bunch.

656
00:56:18,707 --> 00:56:22,377
Now, having spoken my piece,

657
00:56:22,444 --> 00:56:27,248
I would like to know, in all candor,

658
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:30,835
how you feel about what I've said...

659
00:56:30,903 --> 00:56:34,122
and to ask if I have your approval.

660
00:56:36,258 --> 00:56:41,479
Not if they tied me to a horse
and pulled me 40 miles by my tongue.

661
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:45,817
Well, that's an honest answer, sir.

662
00:56:45,885 --> 00:56:50,321
Not if they hung me from a tree
and put a lit bomb in my mouth.

663
00:56:50,389 --> 00:56:52,356
I respect your frankness.

664
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,994
I think we understand
how we stand now.

665
00:56:56,061 --> 00:57:00,114
It's not a question
of my not approving of you.

666
00:57:00,182 --> 00:57:03,200
It's a question of...

667
00:57:03,268 --> 00:57:06,721
I don't like one goddamn thing about you.

668
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:10,324
Ah. Well, initial judgments
very often are misleading.

669
00:57:10,392 --> 00:57:13,845
I found that out to my sorrow, sir.

670
00:57:13,913 --> 00:57:16,197
You come hanging around
my daughter on your honeymoon?

671
00:57:16,198 --> 00:57:18,482
Duane.

672
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:20,585
Hang around your wife!

673
00:57:20,586 --> 00:57:22,620
- Don't hang around my daughter!
- Duane, you're shouting, dear.

674
00:57:22,688 --> 00:57:27,508
- Five days, he's married! For God-- five days!
- Darling, please.

675
00:57:27,576 --> 00:57:29,611
Where's respect for
the institution of marriage?

676
00:57:29,678 --> 00:57:34,049
Once I get rid of my mistake, I'm willing
to show you all the respect you would like.

677
00:57:34,116 --> 00:57:38,169
Get him out before I take him into the men's
room and break all the respect in his body.

678
00:57:38,237 --> 00:57:40,688
You've made your point, darling.

679
00:57:40,756 --> 00:57:44,793
If I may, sir, in other words what
you're saying is that...

680
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:48,212
if I want Kelly, I'm gonna have
to put up a hell of a fight then.

681
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,215
Is that, uh--

682
00:57:51,667 --> 00:57:54,002
he's a nut.

683
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:57,622
He's some kind of a goddamn--
get him out of here. Please--

684
00:57:57,689 --> 00:57:59,791
Just don't get upset, dear.

685
00:57:59,858 --> 00:58:02,676
Maybe this isn't the proper
time to discuss this.

686
00:58:02,711 --> 00:58:06,547
Mrs. Corcoran, I hope that you will be
able to see my position in this thing.

687
00:58:06,615 --> 00:58:10,701
And Kelly perhaps--
look for me because I'm coming.

688
00:58:10,769 --> 00:58:14,672
You stay away from her.
I don't hand out my daughter to newlyweds!

689
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:17,558
Why didn't you go to Niagara falls
like everybody else?

690
00:58:17,626 --> 00:58:21,796
Thank you for everything, sir. And look
for me, Kelly, because I'm coming. I'm coming.

691
00:58:21,864 --> 00:58:27,318
You stay the hell out of Minnesota,
you goddamn newlywed!

692
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,612
What is this?
Am I talking to myself?

693
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,698
You've eaten four shells.

694
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:55,446
Is it terrific? Did I exaggerate?
Was it worth waiting for?

695
00:58:55,514 --> 00:58:57,916
It's fantastic.

696
00:58:57,983 --> 00:59:02,904
Now... save some room
for that great pecan pie. Right?

697
00:59:02,971 --> 00:59:04,906
Yummy yum pecan pie?

698
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:06,891
Pardon me, sir.

699
00:59:06,959 --> 00:59:11,612
Lenny, are you gonna tell me the thing
you want to discuss?

700
00:59:14,834 --> 00:59:17,368
- May I?
- Yeah.

701
00:59:20,856 --> 00:59:22,823
Thank you.

702
00:59:22,891 --> 00:59:26,277
This place must really be expensive.

703
00:59:27,947 --> 00:59:29,880
Can we afford this?

704
00:59:29,948 --> 00:59:33,969
Yeah.

705
00:59:34,036 --> 00:59:37,088
Don't worry about the money.
Listen, Lila--

706
00:59:38,824 --> 00:59:42,076
money is the last thing that you
should be worrying about tonight.

707
00:59:42,144 --> 00:59:45,897
Really. Just enjoy yourself,
enjoy your dinner.

708
00:59:45,964 --> 00:59:49,400
I am!
I really am!

709
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:57,025
What is it, Lenny?
What did you want to tell me?

710
00:59:57,092 --> 00:59:59,127
Hmm?

711
01:00:00,913 --> 01:00:04,883
Pardon me, sir. I'm afraid we're
a little late with the pecan pie.

712
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:07,451
Chef tells me we ran out
about ten minutes ago.

713
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:10,471
- Would you like to order something else?
- Wait a minute.

714
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:15,894
What, are you joking? No pecan pie?

715
01:00:15,961 --> 01:00:18,096
- Sorry, sir.
- No pecan pie!

716
01:00:18,164 --> 01:00:20,297
Lenny, what are you doing?

717
01:00:20,365 --> 01:00:23,418
The main reason we came here
was for the pecan pie.

718
01:00:23,485 --> 01:00:25,586
That's all right.

719
01:00:25,587 --> 01:00:27,688
No, it's not. They should've said
that to us at the door.

720
01:00:27,756 --> 01:00:31,726
They should've warned us that there was
a danger of running out of pecan pie.

721
01:00:31,793 --> 01:00:34,329
Well, there is one small piece left
in the kitchen.

722
01:00:34,396 --> 01:00:37,281
Would you want that one piece?

723
01:00:37,349 --> 01:00:40,151
We also have some
excellent blueberry pie.

724
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:44,622
I mean, we drove
all the way from New York.

725
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:48,108
Listen. Take it. Take the pecan pie.
We can share it.

726
01:00:48,176 --> 01:00:51,496
I don't wanna share it!
I promised my wife the pecan pie.

727
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:54,816
I want you to--
bring the pecan pie for my wife.

728
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:57,234
I promised--
just bring me some coffee.

729
01:00:57,302 --> 01:00:59,403
No blueberry pie?

730
01:01:01,874 --> 01:01:04,725
What do I want any blueberry pie for?

731
01:01:04,793 --> 01:01:07,395
- Yes, sir.
- It's not a reject, is it?

732
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:11,432
- It's a perfectly good piece of pie, right?
- Yes, sir.

733
01:01:14,236 --> 01:01:16,237
That really bugs me.

734
01:01:16,304 --> 01:01:19,190
I've been talking about that pie
as far back as Virginia.

735
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:21,459
If I'd have given him ten bucks,

736
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:23,661
you'd have had pecan pie
flying outta your ears by now.

737
01:01:23,729 --> 01:01:26,164
- They got it back there.
- It's all right.

738
01:01:29,117 --> 01:01:31,485
Honey, I'm getting the pie,

739
01:01:31,553 --> 01:01:33,488
and I'm very happy.

740
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,774
Lenny?

741
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:42,030
Tonight's been the best night
of our whole trip.

742
01:01:42,097 --> 01:01:44,115
Hasn't it?

743
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,600
Aren't you happy tonight?

744
01:01:50,322 --> 01:01:55,043
See, that's part of what
I wanted to talk about.

745
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:57,278
Um--

746
01:02:00,382 --> 01:02:02,349
geez, it's warm in here.

747
01:02:02,417 --> 01:02:05,887
You pay these kind of prices,
the air-conditioning is faulty in here.

748
01:02:05,954 --> 01:02:09,373
- It's just--
- I think it's probably your sunburn.

749
01:02:10,726 --> 01:02:14,445
Go on, Lenny.
What were you gonna say?

750
01:02:14,513 --> 01:02:18,283
No, I was just gonna say that, uh--

751
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:21,536
um... that, uh--

752
01:02:21,603 --> 01:02:26,440
when I was sitting out on the hot
courtroom steps this afternoon,

753
01:02:26,525 --> 01:02:29,810
uh, I was thinking
that in three weeks...

754
01:02:29,878 --> 01:02:33,063
You're gonna be 22 years old.

755
01:02:33,131 --> 01:02:35,049
- The 12th.
- Right.

756
01:02:35,117 --> 01:02:38,169
And the really fantastic thing
about being 22 years old...

757
01:02:38,237 --> 01:02:40,821
is that you have
your whole life in front of you.

758
01:02:40,889 --> 01:02:43,491
I know.
We both have.

759
01:02:43,558 --> 01:02:46,677
I-- I mean, the people you could meet,

760
01:02:46,745 --> 01:02:49,697
the places you could go,
the things that you could do.

761
01:02:49,765 --> 01:02:53,184
- It's just--
- Lenny, I never thought that I'd get to Florida.

762
01:02:53,252 --> 01:02:57,288
That's right. I mean, what some women
would not give to be 22 years old.

763
01:02:57,356 --> 01:03:00,808
- It's just a--
- That's right. I know it.

764
01:03:00,876 --> 01:03:03,761
To go when you want,
to do-- to live.

765
01:03:03,829 --> 01:03:06,364
To live!
Do you know what I mean?

766
01:03:07,582 --> 01:03:11,686
To live. Is that what you mean, Lenny?

767
01:03:14,339 --> 01:03:17,108
We only pass through once, right?

768
01:03:17,175 --> 01:03:20,127
I mean, we can't squander it,
no matter what happens.

769
01:03:20,162 --> 01:03:24,298
We're just passing this way but one time.
We can't squander it.

770
01:03:24,366 --> 01:03:27,035
Once is a lot.

771
01:03:27,102 --> 01:03:29,204
Once is a whole lifetime.

772
01:03:29,271 --> 01:03:32,457
That's why we have to use...

773
01:03:32,524 --> 01:03:34,809
And learn from anything that happens.

774
01:03:34,876 --> 01:03:36,978
We have to...

775
01:03:37,045 --> 01:03:41,198
learn from the good, from the bad,
from the happiness, from the tragic.

776
01:03:41,266 --> 01:03:45,303
We have to learn.
We have to use it all. To use it all.

777
01:03:47,439 --> 01:03:49,873
You're so deep, Lenny.

778
01:03:49,941 --> 01:03:52,960
I never knew that you were so deep.

779
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:09,510
Do you sense at all
what I'm trying to say?

780
01:04:09,577 --> 01:04:11,679
Do you, uh--

781
01:04:13,399 --> 01:04:17,434
oh, Christ, it's so hot in here.
Is it hot in here, or is it hot in here?

782
01:04:22,074 --> 01:04:24,792
What? I--
I don't underst--

783
01:04:24,859 --> 01:04:27,127
What are you trying to tell me?

784
01:04:27,195 --> 01:04:29,697
Let me--

785
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:31,833
I'm trying to say...

786
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:37,355
We have to prepare ourselves.

787
01:04:37,422 --> 01:04:42,043
We have to prepare ourselves
for anything, you know?

788
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:45,629
I mean, everything could be terrific.

789
01:04:45,697 --> 01:04:48,366
The world could be singing.

790
01:04:48,433 --> 01:04:50,784
And then suddenly--

791
01:04:50,852 --> 01:04:53,754
suddenly, for no reason at all,

792
01:04:53,822 --> 01:04:55,990
it's over.

793
01:04:57,893 --> 01:05:01,112
It's over, Lila.

794
01:05:07,353 --> 01:05:09,620
Oh, my God.

795
01:05:10,839 --> 01:05:13,074
Oh, my God, Lenny.

796
01:05:14,526 --> 01:05:17,478
I think I know what
you're trying to tell me.

797
01:05:17,545 --> 01:05:20,898
I didn't want it to happen.
I didn't plan it.

798
01:05:20,965 --> 01:05:23,951
You're good. You're good.
You deserve better than me.

799
01:05:24,019 --> 01:05:27,104
You deserve much better than me.
I didn't want it to happen.

800
01:05:27,172 --> 01:05:31,108
- I didn't plan anything like this.
- Oh, Lenny.

801
01:05:31,176 --> 01:05:34,462
Oh, Lenny! Oh, my God, Lenny!

802
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,048
Oh, Lenny, you're dying.

803
01:05:38,116 --> 01:05:41,535
Oh, Lenny, oh, God,
why didn't you never tell me?

804
01:05:41,603 --> 01:05:43,704
Oh, Lenny!

805
01:05:43,772 --> 01:05:47,441
I'm not dying!
Who said anything about dying?

806
01:05:47,509 --> 01:05:49,777
I want out of the marriage!

807
01:05:49,812 --> 01:05:53,830
I want out
of the goddamn marriage.

808
01:06:06,744 --> 01:06:10,331
- I'm gonna throw up.
- Listen to me. We're not right for each other.

809
01:06:10,415 --> 01:06:13,184
We're not right for each other.
It didn't work out.

810
01:06:13,251 --> 01:06:16,270
I tried to tell you as far back as Virginia,
but you couldn't see it.

811
01:06:16,337 --> 01:06:19,223
You were too busy yelling
"pee-pee" every two minutes.

812
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:21,892
- Lenny, let me get to the bathroom, please.
- No, no.

813
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:25,629
- I have to throw up now.
- Listen, listen. Listen to me. Please listen to me.

814
01:06:25,697 --> 01:06:28,299
- Oh, God.
- Isn't it better it happens now...

815
01:06:28,367 --> 01:06:31,485
Than in ten years from now when we got
three or four kids running around?

816
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,872
Please pay attention! I don't want
to have to say this a second time.

817
01:06:34,939 --> 01:06:37,725
- Lenny, I'm gonna do it on the table.
- Here. Drink some water.

818
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:41,545
Please. I think people
are starting to look at us.

819
01:06:41,613 --> 01:06:45,483
- Oh, God, Lenny, please. Help me, Lenny.
- Okay. Okay. Here.

820
01:06:45,551 --> 01:06:49,136
I don't want to do it on the table.

821
01:06:49,204 --> 01:06:51,372
Just drink the water.

822
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,809
Okay, take it easy. Just take it easy.
Take it easy. Okay?

823
01:06:55,877 --> 01:06:59,513
Give me a quarter for the ladies' room, please.
Would you please help me--

824
01:06:59,581 --> 01:07:03,167
I'm gonna give you more than a quarter.
I'm gonna make a tremendous settlement.

825
01:07:03,234 --> 01:07:06,186
Give me a quarter for
the ladies' room, please.

826
01:07:06,221 --> 01:07:09,340
I'm gonna make a terrific settlement,
a generous settlement.

827
01:07:09,408 --> 01:07:11,675
I'm gonna give you everything.

828
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:17,031
I'm gonna give you the car.
I'm gonna give you all the luggage.

829
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:19,733
I'm gonna give you
all the wedding presents.

830
01:07:19,818 --> 01:07:23,370
For a marriage that's not a week old,
that's pretty good.

831
01:07:23,438 --> 01:07:25,840
Some people don't get that
after 40 years.

832
01:07:25,907 --> 01:07:28,692
I kept the car in tip-top shape.
That's terrific.

833
01:07:31,713 --> 01:07:34,848
What is that sound?
What are these sounds? Come on.

834
01:07:34,916 --> 01:07:37,268
Honey.

835
01:07:37,336 --> 01:07:39,603
Oh, oh.

836
01:07:39,671 --> 01:07:42,790
Honey. Lila, come on.
It's not the end of the world!

837
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:46,344
It's just a crummy annulment.
Come on!

838
01:07:46,411 --> 01:07:48,346
- Come on.
- Pecan pie.

839
01:07:48,413 --> 01:07:50,847
- No, no. Okay. Thank you.
- Is it all right?

840
01:07:50,915 --> 01:07:53,534
- Would you like some whipped cream?
- No! It's okay.

841
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:56,237
- Shall I leave the whip--
- Leave it! Fine, fine.

842
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:58,956
Listen, honey.
It's good. It's good.

843
01:07:59,024 --> 01:08:02,242
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Take it easy.

844
01:08:02,310 --> 01:08:05,963
<i>Take it easy.
Okay. Okay.</i>

845
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:08,399
Okay. Listen now.

846
01:08:08,466 --> 01:08:11,318
I would like, if possible--

847
01:08:11,386 --> 01:08:15,656
if possible, if we could
settle this tonight, you know,

848
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:20,161
because, you know, check-out time
is 11:00 tomorrow morning.

849
01:08:20,228 --> 01:08:24,164
Unless you want to stay on
for a couple of days and then--

850
01:08:24,232 --> 01:08:26,166
I'll work that into the settlement.

851
01:08:26,234 --> 01:08:28,335
I mean, it's--

852
01:08:28,403 --> 01:08:32,389
you know what? I feel that we're over
the worst of it now.

853
01:08:34,225 --> 01:08:36,427
I-- I-- I actually--

854
01:08:38,063 --> 01:08:41,115
I feel closer to you right now...

855
01:08:41,182 --> 01:08:44,601
Than I think we've ever
felt before, you know?

856
01:08:44,669 --> 01:08:47,037
Sometimes...

857
01:08:47,105 --> 01:08:50,223
when two people experience
a common tragedy,

858
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:53,210
it creates a bond between people
that can last a life--

859
01:08:53,278 --> 01:08:57,814
You know what I would like? I would like
that we should have dinner sometime.

860
01:08:57,882 --> 01:09:00,551
You know?
And I think that then...

861
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:03,437
we could look back on all of this...

862
01:09:03,504 --> 01:09:07,675
and we could see all the good
that's come out of this.

863
01:09:07,742 --> 01:09:09,910
That's the way--

864
01:09:09,978 --> 01:09:13,430
That's-- that's the way
I would like this to end.

865
01:09:13,498 --> 01:09:18,018
Wouldn't you? Don't you think
that's a good way, to, uh, to look--

866
01:09:29,948 --> 01:09:32,617
Better?

867
01:09:32,684 --> 01:09:35,736
It's better?
You feel a little bit better?

868
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:38,439
You feel a little--
you okay?

869
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:42,376
- You okay?
- Yeah.

870
01:09:44,445 --> 01:09:46,914
Hi.

871
01:09:46,981 --> 01:09:51,552
Gonna eat the pie?
You want a little piece of pie?

872
01:09:51,636 --> 01:09:54,705
- No?
- No. No.

873
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:57,357
Okay. Okay.

874
01:10:23,451 --> 01:10:26,937
<i># Just like me #</i>

875
01:10:27,005 --> 01:10:30,423
<i># they long to be #</i>

876
01:10:30,458 --> 01:10:34,078
<i># close to you #</i>

877
01:10:36,965 --> 01:10:40,184
Sign here.
Just initial it.

878
01:10:40,251 --> 01:10:43,203
That's right. Okay.
Now over here.

879
01:10:44,422 --> 01:10:46,357
That's fine.

880
01:10:46,424 --> 01:10:48,793
And here again.
Right.

881
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:56,383
We appreciate this, Ralph. My mother and I
want you to know we really appreciate this.

882
01:10:56,450 --> 01:11:00,320
- I have office hours during the day, you know.
- Speed is our best weapon.

883
01:11:00,388 --> 01:11:03,057
In quick, out quick.
That's what they taught us in the army.

884
01:11:03,124 --> 01:11:06,076
An annulment is gonna take
from three to six months.

885
01:11:06,144 --> 01:11:09,195
If you want a divorce quick,
she'll have to go to Santo Domingo.

886
01:11:09,263 --> 01:11:11,431
Santo Domingo?

887
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:16,920
She didn't have much of
a vacation in Florida, anyway.

888
01:11:16,988 --> 01:11:20,274
I wish you'd have let me discuss settlement.
I could've saved you money.

889
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:23,594
It's settled. It's settled.
I gave her everything.

890
01:11:23,662 --> 01:11:26,847
All I kept was my savings bonds, $900.

891
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:30,367
- I could've done better for you.
- No. I want it this way.

892
01:11:30,435 --> 01:11:35,288
I'm not looking to come out a winner.
I'm willing to pay for my mistake.

893
01:11:35,356 --> 01:11:38,442
Of course, if she's willing to discuss it,
I'll leave that up to you.

894
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:40,661
The final papers will come
through in about three weeks.

895
01:11:40,662 --> 01:11:42,812
The sooner, the better.

896
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,299
I'm heading for the midwest.

897
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,718
- I'll send you my address.
- What's in the midwest?

898
01:11:48,936 --> 01:11:52,123
A terrific girl I met on my honeymoon.

899
01:11:52,190 --> 01:11:55,308
Don't worry. I'll send you an invitation.

900
01:12:43,241 --> 01:12:45,575
Hi, Mr. Corc.

901
01:12:45,643 --> 01:12:48,094
Len Cantrow from Florida?

902
01:12:48,162 --> 01:12:50,897
I'm here.

903
01:12:50,965 --> 01:12:53,918
I don't expect you to let me see your
daughter right off, sir,

904
01:12:53,985 --> 01:12:56,586
but I just wanted to stop by
and let you know...

905
01:12:56,654 --> 01:12:59,240
that it wasn't some wild story
I made up in Florida.

906
01:12:59,307 --> 01:13:02,826
I have gotten myself free.

907
01:13:02,893 --> 01:13:06,013
Well, I've gotta run now
because I'm getting myself set up.

908
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:08,915
Please say hello
to Mrs. Corcoran for me.

909
01:13:08,983 --> 01:13:13,120
Would you please tell Kelly that I've gotten
myself a room at the Knoll Way Motel?

910
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:15,855
Knoll Way Motel.

911
01:13:15,923 --> 01:13:18,876
Good afternoon, sir,
and I hope I see you again very soon.

912
01:13:21,896 --> 01:13:23,931
Cantrow.

913
01:13:23,998 --> 01:13:26,000
Sir?

914
01:13:27,886 --> 01:13:31,171
You show your face here again,

915
01:13:31,239 --> 01:13:35,609
I'm gonna kick your ass
right over the Canadian border.

916
01:14:23,541 --> 01:14:25,475
<i>And now for the weather.</i>

917
01:14:25,543 --> 01:14:28,528
<i>The 11:00 P.M. twin cities temperature
is 13 degrees below zero,</i>

918
01:14:28,596 --> 01:14:30,530
<i>barometer rising.</i>

919
01:14:30,598 --> 01:14:33,784
<i>A new warm front moving down from Canada
will bring tomorrow's temperature...</i>

920
01:14:33,852 --> 01:14:37,671
<i>Up to a new high ranging
between zero and five above.</i>

921
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:40,323
<i>Temperatures slightly lower
in the suburbs.</i>

922
01:14:40,391 --> 01:14:42,442
<i>Hello, everyone. I'm Bill Williamson,</i>

923
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:44,895
<i>your Minneapolis-St. Paul
weatherman.</i>

924
01:14:44,962 --> 01:14:48,414
<i>There's good news in the twin cities
weather forecast for tonight.</i>

925
01:14:48,482 --> 01:14:52,752
<i>But first, the current temperature in Minneapolis
is three degrees below zero.</i>

926
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:56,824
<i>It's two degrees below in St. Paul
and four below at the airport.</i>

927
01:14:56,891 --> 01:14:59,960
<i>The barometer is
30.02 and rising.</i>

928
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:03,080
<i>Winds are from the northwest
at four Miles per hour.</i>

929
01:15:03,148 --> 01:15:07,868
<i>Temperatures will fall to between 18
and 21 degrees below zero tonight.</i>

930
01:15:32,393 --> 01:15:34,628
Kelly!

931
01:15:38,566 --> 01:15:42,836
- I'm here. I made it.
- I heard. You must be crazy or something.

932
01:15:42,903 --> 01:15:45,656
- I'm out. I'm free and clear, just like I said.
- Hi, Kelly.

933
01:15:45,724 --> 01:15:50,060
Hi. You must've been crazy,
just ringing my bell like that.

934
01:15:51,413 --> 01:15:54,114
- Hi, Kelly.
- Hi.

935
01:15:54,181 --> 01:15:57,551
- I can't talk to you. I've got political science.
- Wait a second.

936
01:15:57,618 --> 01:16:01,037
We've got serious things to discuss.

937
01:16:01,105 --> 01:16:03,540
Look. I'm very flattered you came, really,

938
01:16:03,608 --> 01:16:06,226
...but the situation's impossible.
- Kelly.

939
01:16:06,293 --> 01:16:08,661
- Just a minute.
- Hello, Kelly.

940
01:16:08,729 --> 01:16:11,398
- Hi. I've gotta go.
- Wait a minute.

941
01:16:11,466 --> 01:16:14,551
You worried about your father?
I'm gonna handle that.

942
01:16:14,618 --> 01:16:18,555
My father says that if you're not gone by tonight,
he's gonna get you with his car.

943
01:16:18,623 --> 01:16:20,791
- I have to go.
- Listen. Kelly, listen.

944
01:16:20,859 --> 01:16:23,577
Hey, I'm real surprised.

945
01:16:23,644 --> 01:16:27,230
I'm surprised by your reaction.
I mean, I'm really very surprised.

946
01:16:27,298 --> 01:16:29,799
You picked a bad time to come.

947
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:32,886
Bad time?

948
01:16:32,953 --> 01:16:37,090
Do you remember Florida? I mean,
does Florida seem vaguely familiar to you?

949
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:39,909
Certainly I remember Florida.
I'll never forget it.

950
01:16:39,977 --> 01:16:43,964
But this is Minnesota, and I've got
Political Science, and I've gotta go.

951
01:16:45,666 --> 01:16:48,001
I'm really very flattered.

952
01:16:52,923 --> 01:16:55,859
- A guy I met in Miami.
- What'd he want?

953
01:17:18,983 --> 01:17:22,302
Kelly? Kelly, I gotta talk to you.

954
01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:25,956
- I'm sorry. I've got English lit.
- That's all right.

955
01:17:26,024 --> 01:17:29,727
Listen. I just need two minutes
to talk to you in private.

956
01:17:29,794 --> 01:17:33,480
- Didn't you hear what she said the first time?
- Certainly I heard what she said.

957
01:17:33,547 --> 01:17:37,367
I'm only standing a foot away.
How could I possibly miss it?

958
01:17:37,434 --> 01:17:39,636
- I just need to talk to you for two minutes.
- Hey!

959
01:17:39,703 --> 01:17:42,656
It's okay.
I'll see you in class.

960
01:17:50,381 --> 01:17:53,466
I mean, what did you
think it was, a game?

961
01:17:53,534 --> 01:17:56,419
This is no game.

962
01:17:56,487 --> 01:17:59,089
This is my life.

963
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:02,726
I don't play games with my life.

964
01:18:02,794 --> 01:18:04,728
You really got a divorce?

965
01:18:04,796 --> 01:18:10,017
You think I was just really fooling around
with you in Florida?

966
01:18:10,084 --> 01:18:12,586
Didn't I tell you
I was gonna get a divorce?

967
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:15,288
I don't play games with my life.

968
01:18:15,356 --> 01:18:17,557
Gee, I'm really flattered.

969
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:30,070
I'll tell you the truth. I was under
the impression that our relationship--

970
01:18:34,642 --> 01:18:38,846
was at a much more advanced stage...

971
01:18:38,913 --> 01:18:41,531
than the point where you're
really very flattered.

972
01:18:41,599 --> 01:18:44,818
I just gave up a whole goddamn marriage.

973
01:18:48,706 --> 01:18:52,709
You caught me off guard.
It's my first day back at school.

974
01:18:52,777 --> 01:18:56,596
- I've got English lit.
- Oh, you know, screw English lit!

975
01:18:56,681 --> 01:18:59,615
I just gave half my life away!

976
01:19:03,587 --> 01:19:05,856
I mean--

977
01:19:07,742 --> 01:19:10,460
you don't even say hello to me!

978
01:19:10,528 --> 01:19:14,347
Where's your goddamn laugh?
I haven't heard your goddamn laugh...

979
01:19:14,415 --> 01:19:17,201
one time since I've been here.

980
01:19:17,268 --> 01:19:19,986
I can't help it.
Florida seems like such a long time ago.

981
01:19:20,054 --> 01:19:23,023
It's two weeks ago. What, you can't retain
a memory for two weeks?

982
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:25,408
I gave up $6,000.

983
01:19:25,476 --> 01:19:27,577
I gave up my wife.

984
01:19:27,645 --> 01:19:31,197
I gave up my car.
And you can't retain a memory for two--

985
01:19:31,265 --> 01:19:33,433
What, are you-- are you re--

986
01:19:36,253 --> 01:19:39,872
What was all the-- what was all the
"you're sitting on my stool"?

987
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:42,041
"That's my spot."

988
01:19:42,109 --> 01:19:46,112
What is all that crap?
Really, that's just a bunch of crap!

989
01:19:47,831 --> 01:19:49,933
And I'm a schmuck!

990
01:19:52,453 --> 01:19:55,255
- I was very attracted to you.
- Were you?

991
01:19:55,322 --> 01:19:59,259
<i>You were very attracted to me.
You were very-- well, that's cute.</i>

992
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:01,528
That's a cute thing.

993
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:04,164
So I was, uh...

994
01:20:04,232 --> 01:20:06,432
Something to do.

995
01:20:10,037 --> 01:20:12,539
No, I can understand that.
I can under--

996
01:20:12,607 --> 01:20:14,574
Listen. What is it--

997
01:20:14,642 --> 01:20:17,961
I had a crummy divorce.
What is it to me, right?

998
01:20:18,029 --> 01:20:20,330
I also got a suntan.

999
01:20:20,398 --> 01:20:23,316
You really have to look at it that way.
That's the way life is--

1000
01:20:23,351 --> 01:20:25,485
good and bad, you know.

1001
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,954
The important thing is
that you get to English lit.

1002
01:20:28,022 --> 01:20:32,291
<i>That's really the important
thing that we do here.</i>

1003
01:20:32,359 --> 01:20:35,078
- Hey.
- What?

1004
01:20:35,146 --> 01:20:38,698
Don't get so morbid.
Give a girl a chance.

1005
01:21:11,632 --> 01:21:14,751
Is this how they kiss in Minnesota?

1006
01:21:16,687 --> 01:21:19,523
I'm getting a house this afternoon.

1007
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:23,526
First, you have to take me
back to English lit.

1008
01:21:23,594 --> 01:21:27,680
What time is your last class?
Pick you up after your last class.

1009
01:21:27,748 --> 01:21:31,451
Well, it's at 2:30, but...

1010
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:35,104
I was supposed to meet someone.

1011
01:21:35,172 --> 01:21:38,091
What, the guy with the big neck?

1012
01:21:38,158 --> 01:21:41,545
That guy's got a 40-inch neck.
You know, he's finished.

1013
01:21:41,612 --> 01:21:44,631
That guy is through.
That's over, really.

1014
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:46,733
The money is here.

1015
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:50,636
But I wouldn't start in with him.
He's captain of everything.

1016
01:21:52,456 --> 01:21:57,460
I spent three years in the armed forces.
That guy is through.

1017
01:22:14,295 --> 01:22:16,329
Kelly!

1018
01:22:17,482 --> 01:22:19,682
Kelly--

1019
01:22:23,821 --> 01:22:26,156
I'm getting sick and tired
of you bugging Kelly.

1020
01:22:26,224 --> 01:22:29,442
Yes, I understand.
I'd like to introduce myself.

1021
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:33,196
My name is Leonard Cantrow. I'm with
the Department of Justice, Bureau of Narcotics.

1022
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:37,200
I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.
May I see that cigarette?

1023
01:22:49,163 --> 01:22:52,349
May I see the pack that came out of?

1024
01:22:52,416 --> 01:22:55,668
You wanna just step back there a minute, please.
You a student here?

1025
01:22:55,736 --> 01:22:58,138
- Yeah.
- What year are you in?

1026
01:22:58,222 --> 01:23:01,641
- Sophomore.
- What's your name, please?

1027
01:23:01,709 --> 01:23:04,143
You don't need my name.

1028
01:23:04,178 --> 01:23:06,846
Son, I don't want any trouble here.
I just asked you your name.

1029
01:23:06,931 --> 01:23:09,832
- No.
- What is your name?

1030
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:12,852
What is your name?

1031
01:23:18,025 --> 01:23:20,360
Apparently that fellow has
something to be frightened of.

1032
01:23:20,444 --> 01:23:23,929
- Do you fellows have anything to be frightened of?
- I don't.

1033
01:23:23,997 --> 01:23:28,167
- How long have you known Miss Corcoran, please?
- About two years.

1034
01:23:28,235 --> 01:23:30,703
To the best of your knowledge,
does she use drugs of any kind?

1035
01:23:30,738 --> 01:23:33,373
No.

1036
01:23:33,457 --> 01:23:37,109
- Do you boys have any reason to run?
- No.

1037
01:23:37,177 --> 01:23:41,414
Then why don't you just walk, then?
Just walk on.

1038
01:23:41,482 --> 01:23:44,567
You tell your friend I'm coming back tomorrow.
Thank you, fellas.

1039
01:23:44,635 --> 01:23:47,687
Just keep your nose clean.
Kelly.

1040
01:23:47,755 --> 01:23:50,022
Keep moving, please.

1041
01:23:57,581 --> 01:24:01,301
<i>- Where? At my place?
- No, not a motel.</i>

1042
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:05,671
<i>Where? You want to suggest a place?
Wherever you wanna suggest.</i>

1043
01:24:05,739 --> 01:24:09,025
We have a summer cabin in the mountains.

1044
01:24:09,092 --> 01:24:11,711
It's not heated,
but we could have a big fire.

1045
01:24:11,779 --> 01:24:14,247
- All right?
- A cabin.

1046
01:24:14,315 --> 01:24:17,917
A cabin.

1047
01:24:17,985 --> 01:24:24,958
That's great.

1048
01:24:22,423 --> 01:24:24,958
All my life...

1049
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:29,295
I've dreamt of a cabin and a fire,

1050
01:24:29,363 --> 01:24:31,381
an incredible girl.

1051
01:24:31,448 --> 01:24:35,485
Have you got the nerve to try something
very dangerous?

1052
01:24:37,054 --> 01:24:41,174
What do you think?
I mean, what do you think?

1053
01:24:41,241 --> 01:24:44,243
We'll have to take off all our clothes.

1054
01:24:44,311 --> 01:24:46,379
Okay?

1055
01:24:46,446 --> 01:24:50,467
What a terrific idea.
Whatever it is, I love it!

1056
01:24:52,669 --> 01:24:56,590
- Remember, I'm not gonna sleep with you.
- That's all right.

1057
01:24:56,674 --> 01:25:00,593
Even if we just did this,
it would be terrific.

1058
01:25:02,262 --> 01:25:05,414
I've never done this before.
A girlfriend told me about it.

1059
01:25:05,482 --> 01:25:09,169
I love her. Whoever she is, I love her.

1060
01:25:09,237 --> 01:25:11,570
- I'm way ahead of you. Let me help.
- No, no.

1061
01:25:11,638 --> 01:25:14,090
That's the whole point-- no touching.

1062
01:25:14,158 --> 01:25:17,093
We take off everything and get as close
as we can without touching.

1063
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:20,180
- It's a lot harder than it sounds.
- I love it!

1064
01:25:20,247 --> 01:25:22,182
I love it!

1065
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:25,769
All my life I've wanted to be
in a place like this...

1066
01:25:25,836 --> 01:25:28,988
with a girl like you
playing a game like this.

1067
01:25:29,056 --> 01:25:32,241
- Hurry up. Let's play.
- I don't know if I can go through with it.

1068
01:25:32,309 --> 01:25:36,012
Oh, yes, you can. Sure.
I mean, it's just a game.

1069
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,882
The worst thing that
could happen is you'd lose.

1070
01:25:40,351 --> 01:25:43,469
All right.
Step back a few feet.

1071
01:25:47,424 --> 01:25:50,343
One more foot.

1072
01:25:51,762 --> 01:25:55,699
Why don't we begin?
Should we just start?

1073
01:25:55,766 --> 01:25:58,818
All right.
I'll go first.

1074
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:21,607
Thank you, God.

1075
01:26:21,675 --> 01:26:25,428
I'm just seeing your masterpiece,
and I thank you for it.

1076
01:26:25,496 --> 01:26:27,897
Okay, now you.

1077
01:26:30,367 --> 01:26:32,701
Now what do we do?

1078
01:26:32,769 --> 01:26:36,189
We just walk towards each other
and see how close we can get,

1079
01:26:36,224 --> 01:26:38,357
but we mustn't touch.

1080
01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:59,546
I think we're close enough.

1081
01:27:04,284 --> 01:27:06,385
No. Uh...

1082
01:27:07,938 --> 01:27:11,190
I think we could get a little closer.

1083
01:27:11,258 --> 01:27:13,193
You do?

1084
01:27:16,347 --> 01:27:18,882
I do. I honestly do.

1085
01:27:35,866 --> 01:27:39,352
I think my father misjudged you, Lenny.

1086
01:27:41,455 --> 01:27:43,422
I really do.

1087
01:27:44,808 --> 01:27:50,163
You're the most decent,
honorable man I have ever met.

1088
01:27:50,230 --> 01:27:53,015
Well, thank you.
Thank you, Kelly.

1089
01:27:57,087 --> 01:28:00,190
- I'll sleep with you tomorrow night.
- Oh?

1090
01:28:03,743 --> 01:28:06,196
Oh, I'll be back about 11:00.

1091
01:28:07,347 --> 01:28:09,883
I have to borrow some books for class.

1092
01:28:09,950 --> 01:28:12,101
Don't wait up.

1093
01:28:24,848 --> 01:28:27,683
I knew it could be like this.

1094
01:28:27,751 --> 01:28:30,636
Never was like this.

1095
01:28:30,671 --> 01:28:33,039
I knew it was possible.

1096
01:28:34,641 --> 01:28:38,561
Don't let me fall asleep.
I have to be back by 11:00.

1097
01:28:40,431 --> 01:28:42,532
I knew I wasn't crazy.

1098
01:28:44,468 --> 01:28:48,388
A lot of people might've
thought I was crazy.

1099
01:28:48,455 --> 01:28:53,476
I knew-- I knew it.
I think I'm gonna surprise a lot of people.

1100
01:28:53,544 --> 01:28:57,747
I know one who's gonna be surprised.

1101
01:28:57,814 --> 01:28:59,982
Don't worry about your father.

1102
01:29:00,050 --> 01:29:02,752
Your father and I are gonna
understand each other.

1103
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:06,923
It's just a question of us
sitting down together.

1104
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:10,109
I love listening to you.

1105
01:29:10,177 --> 01:29:12,812
You're so positive about everything.

1106
01:29:14,314 --> 01:29:16,582
Daddy's the same way.

1107
01:29:19,319 --> 01:29:22,204
- You like that, huh?
- I love that.

1108
01:29:22,272 --> 01:29:24,891
I don't want him in this house.

1109
01:29:24,959 --> 01:29:29,145
I don't want him in this town.
This is my house.

1110
01:29:29,212 --> 01:29:33,983
I pay taxes in this town. I don't want him
in my town. I don't want him in my house.

1111
01:29:34,067 --> 01:29:38,571
- Well, why not, Duane?
- Because I hate him, that's why not.

1112
01:29:38,638 --> 01:29:43,543
But, despite that,
Kelly says he's an admirable young man.

1113
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:48,665
Well, can't you at least see him?

1114
01:30:00,393 --> 01:30:02,494
For me, daddy?

1115
01:30:04,531 --> 01:30:07,333
Please do it... for me.

1116
01:30:18,278 --> 01:30:22,782
I understand you're quite taken with this part
of the country, Mr. Cantrow.

1117
01:30:22,866 --> 01:30:24,784
<i>Leonard. Yes, ma'am.</i>

1118
01:30:24,852 --> 01:30:28,003
I like what I see out here, and...

1119
01:30:28,071 --> 01:30:31,190
I like what I breathe out here.

1120
01:30:31,258 --> 01:30:35,694
I've just about made up my mind
that I'm gonna make this my home.

1121
01:30:35,762 --> 01:30:37,696
Oh!

1122
01:30:37,764 --> 01:30:40,600
Well, from what I've seen,

1123
01:30:40,684 --> 01:30:43,652
I'd say you're
a very determined young man.

1124
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:47,990
I take that as a compliment, Mrs. Corcoran.

1125
01:30:53,213 --> 01:30:55,581
<i>Thank you.</i>

1126
01:30:55,649 --> 01:30:59,918
I don't mind saying this is one of the finest
meals that I've ever had.

1127
01:30:59,986 --> 01:31:02,839
Oh, thank you, Leonard.

1128
01:31:02,907 --> 01:31:04,874
It's simple, you know.

1129
01:31:04,942 --> 01:31:08,911
Mr. Corcoran doesn't
really care for fancy food,

1130
01:31:08,979 --> 01:31:13,583
though I imagine you've tried just about
every kind of exotic dish in New York.

1131
01:31:13,650 --> 01:31:16,185
Exactly. See, that's the trouble.

1132
01:31:16,253 --> 01:31:18,704
It's exotic, but it's not honest.

1133
01:31:18,772 --> 01:31:21,441
I mean, it's fancy, but it's not real.

1134
01:31:21,508 --> 01:31:24,961
I mean, this is honest food.

1135
01:31:25,028 --> 01:31:27,980
There's no lying in that beef.

1136
01:31:28,048 --> 01:31:31,817
There's no, uh...
Insincerity in those potatoes.

1137
01:31:33,821 --> 01:31:35,905
There's no deceit in the cauliflower.

1138
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:38,323
This is a totally honest meal.

1139
01:31:38,391 --> 01:31:41,644
You don't know what a pleasure it is
to sit down...

1140
01:31:41,712 --> 01:31:45,814
in this day and age and eat food
that you can believe in.

1141
01:31:45,882 --> 01:31:51,270
Oh! Well...
what an original way of putting it.

1142
01:31:51,337 --> 01:31:54,424
Leonard's so positive, isn't he, mother?

1143
01:31:54,491 --> 01:31:59,094
Who does he remind you of
when he's so positive like that?

1144
01:31:59,162 --> 01:32:02,348
- Who, dear?
- You know.

1145
01:32:05,435 --> 01:32:07,737
Oh, yes.

1146
01:32:09,973 --> 01:32:13,142
Oh, my goodness.
Why didn't I notice that?

1147
01:32:16,780 --> 01:32:19,281
Oh, of course.

1148
01:32:28,258 --> 01:32:31,410
Tell me, Leonard,
have you given any thought...

1149
01:32:31,478 --> 01:32:34,430
to what your future plans might be?

1150
01:32:34,498 --> 01:32:39,202
I've given it a lot of thought,
Mrs. Corcoran, careful thought.

1151
01:32:39,269 --> 01:32:43,605
I thought actually I would like to do
something that concerns the land.

1152
01:32:43,673 --> 01:32:47,276
The land?
Oh, you mean farming?

1153
01:32:47,344 --> 01:32:50,829
Farming? No, I don't really think so.

1154
01:32:50,897 --> 01:32:53,065
And yet, it's hard to say.

1155
01:32:53,133 --> 01:32:57,470
You see, I want to get back
to origins, to basics.

1156
01:32:57,537 --> 01:32:59,989
Back to the soil, so to speak.

1157
01:33:00,056 --> 01:33:03,125
So many young people today
are going in that direction.

1158
01:33:03,193 --> 01:33:06,445
Concerned young people.

1159
01:33:06,530 --> 01:33:09,198
I think we've taken enough
out of this country.

1160
01:33:09,265 --> 01:33:12,118
I believe it's time that
we started to think about...

1161
01:33:12,185 --> 01:33:14,687
Putting something back into this country.

1162
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:18,557
Oh, you know,
that's very well put, Leonard.

1163
01:33:18,625 --> 01:33:22,995
You know, I read an editorial
in the Minneapolis Star this morning...

1164
01:33:23,063 --> 01:33:25,631
that said the very same thing.

1165
01:33:25,699 --> 01:33:28,134
Really?
I didn't see that.

1166
01:33:32,138 --> 01:33:34,140
Can I get you something, Duane?

1167
01:33:35,491 --> 01:33:37,944
No, thank you.
I wonder if you ladies...

1168
01:33:38,011 --> 01:33:40,747
would allow Mr. Cantrow and I
a few moments alone.

1169
01:33:40,814 --> 01:33:43,248
Oh, yes, of course. Certainly.

1170
01:33:43,316 --> 01:33:46,269
- Mr. Cantrow.
- Excuse me.

1171
01:34:11,494 --> 01:34:14,447
No, sir, thank you. I don't smoke.

1172
01:34:19,770 --> 01:34:21,738
- Leonard.
- Sir.

1173
01:34:21,805 --> 01:34:24,540
I was very quiet at dinner tonight...

1174
01:34:24,607 --> 01:34:27,694
because I was listening.

1175
01:34:27,761 --> 01:34:29,728
I'm in the banking business.

1176
01:34:29,796 --> 01:34:32,982
I'm called upon to have
many business dinners.

1177
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:38,004
I find I can tell more about a man by listening
to his dinner table conversation...

1178
01:34:38,071 --> 01:34:43,308
than by reading all the books and the records
and the balance sheets in the world.

1179
01:34:43,376 --> 01:34:45,645
I heard everything you said--

1180
01:34:45,712 --> 01:34:49,098
your feeling about the big cities,
the clear air out here,

1181
01:34:49,166 --> 01:34:53,102
the honest food,
getting back to the soil.

1182
01:34:55,072 --> 01:34:58,090
And I will tell you...

1183
01:34:58,158 --> 01:35:02,211
quite honestly...
I was very impressed.

1184
01:35:02,279 --> 01:35:06,865
- Oh, I'm very glad to hear that, sir.
- I was very impressed.

1185
01:35:06,933 --> 01:35:11,253
And I think
I can... also say...

1186
01:35:11,321 --> 01:35:13,422
quite honestly...

1187
01:35:15,259 --> 01:35:18,744
I have never heard such a crock
of horseshit in my life.

1188
01:35:18,811 --> 01:35:21,714
Sir?

1189
01:35:21,749 --> 01:35:25,134
"There's no deceit in the cauliflower."

1190
01:35:27,821 --> 01:35:31,089
Where do you get ideas like that?
They just--

1191
01:35:31,157 --> 01:35:33,592
they just come out of
that New York head of yours?

1192
01:35:33,677 --> 01:35:37,196
I was merely trying to impress
the fact that it was a pleasure--

1193
01:35:37,264 --> 01:35:39,415
I see through you.

1194
01:35:40,851 --> 01:35:44,186
You don't think I see through you?

1195
01:35:44,254 --> 01:35:49,258
You could wear two sweaters and a raccoon coat,
I'd still see through you.

1196
01:35:49,325 --> 01:35:53,378
I never once tried to misrepresent myself
or deceive anybody--

1197
01:35:53,446 --> 01:35:56,065
Leonard, you think you're
quite determined, don't you?

1198
01:35:56,133 --> 01:36:00,803
You think once you get your mind set
on something, that's it.

1199
01:36:00,871 --> 01:36:02,972
Leonard,

1200
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:06,625
you don't know what determination is.

1201
01:36:06,693 --> 01:36:09,812
I eat determination for breakfast.

1202
01:36:11,365 --> 01:36:14,583
You want to see a brick wall?

1203
01:36:14,651 --> 01:36:17,936
You're looking at a brick wall.

1204
01:36:18,004 --> 01:36:20,272
I'm very sorry to hear that, sir.

1205
01:36:22,242 --> 01:36:25,244
Did you honestly think
you could come out here...

1206
01:36:25,312 --> 01:36:29,765
and wise-guy yourself a girl like Kelly?

1207
01:36:29,833 --> 01:36:34,202
Maybe you wise-guyed
that football player away, but...

1208
01:36:34,270 --> 01:36:37,506
this is my baby you're talking about.

1209
01:36:39,176 --> 01:36:42,862
Nobody wise-guys away my little baby.

1210
01:36:42,929 --> 01:36:46,115
I have nothing but the deepest respect,
love and feelings for--

1211
01:36:46,182 --> 01:36:49,168
Do you want to talk figures?
All right, let's talk figures.

1212
01:36:49,235 --> 01:36:51,203
Tell me your figure, I'll tell you mine.

1213
01:36:51,271 --> 01:36:55,907
- I don't understand. What do you mean, money?
- Five.

1214
01:36:55,975 --> 01:36:59,661
How does 5,000 grab you?

1215
01:36:59,729 --> 01:37:02,914
I'm shocked.
I am shocked...

1216
01:37:02,982 --> 01:37:05,935
That you would even remotely suggest
that I'm gonna take--

1217
01:37:06,003 --> 01:37:09,689
I am talking 5,000 tax-free dollars.

1218
01:37:09,756 --> 01:37:13,242
- Is that remotely enough for you?
- Suggest that I'm gonna agree--

1219
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:16,428
because if it isn't, I will go 10,000.

1220
01:37:16,496 --> 01:37:19,298
Now, that's a lot
of bats and balls, Cantrow.

1221
01:37:19,366 --> 01:37:21,334
There's not enough money...

1222
01:37:21,335 --> 01:37:23,302
...in all the banks of Minneapolis.
- 15,000.

1223
01:37:23,369 --> 01:37:28,323
15,000. You're talking to a brick wall,
young fellow, a rich brick wall.

1224
01:37:28,391 --> 01:37:30,425
In all the banks of Minnesota.

1225
01:37:30,493 --> 01:37:35,331
Have you any conception of what
$20,000 feels like? What it looks like?

1226
01:37:35,398 --> 01:37:38,016
In all the banks of
the United States of America!

1227
01:37:38,084 --> 01:37:40,819
I'm talking hard cash, goddamn it!

1228
01:37:40,887 --> 01:37:45,908
Cold, hard American currency,
25,000 goddamn dollars!

1229
01:37:47,026 --> 01:37:48,961
Look, Mr. Corcoran.

1230
01:37:49,029 --> 01:37:52,064
I didn't come out here
to negotiate for Kelly.

1231
01:37:52,131 --> 01:37:55,100
I came out here to fight for her.

1232
01:37:55,102 --> 01:37:58,654
I spent three years
in the United States army.

1233
01:37:58,721 --> 01:38:03,292
I fought every goddamn minute
of those three years!

1234
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:06,912
Unfortunately not overseas
because of a minor back injury,

1235
01:38:08,148 --> 01:38:10,950
but in the small army towns
of this country...

1236
01:38:11,017 --> 01:38:14,836
Against the narrow-minded,
petty-brained bigots...

1237
01:38:14,904 --> 01:38:17,473
who look down on anyone
who's nothing more...

1238
01:38:17,541 --> 01:38:20,592
Than your average
hardworking enlisted man!

1239
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:23,195
I don't want your money.

1240
01:38:23,262 --> 01:38:27,149
I don't want your goddamn lousy $25,000!

1241
01:38:29,802 --> 01:38:31,987
What do you want?

1242
01:38:33,957 --> 01:38:36,575
What do you want, goddamn it?

1243
01:38:38,695 --> 01:38:42,281
I want Kelly.
I want Kelly.

1244
01:38:43,649 --> 01:38:46,902
Well, so do I, goddamn it!

1245
01:39:29,463 --> 01:39:31,963
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered together here...

1246
01:39:32,031 --> 01:39:35,384
in the sight of God
and in the face of this company...

1247
01:39:35,452 --> 01:39:40,222
to join together this man and this woman
in holy matrimony,

1248
01:39:40,307 --> 01:39:42,808
which is an honorable estate
instituted of God...

1249
01:39:42,876 --> 01:39:45,377
And signifying unto us
the mystical union...

1250
01:39:45,444 --> 01:39:48,364
that is betwixt Christ and his church.

1251
01:39:48,432 --> 01:39:53,034
Into this holy estate, these two persons
present come now to be joined.

1252
01:39:53,102 --> 01:39:56,638
If any man can show just cause why they
may not lawfully be joined together,

1253
01:39:56,706 --> 01:39:58,741
let him now speak,

1254
01:39:58,808 --> 01:40:02,694
<i>or else forever hold his peace.</i>

1255
01:40:04,397 --> 01:40:07,849
<i>Who giveth this woman
to be married to this man?</i>

1256
01:40:09,719 --> 01:40:11,754
I do.

1257
01:40:29,573 --> 01:40:32,358
Repeat after me.

1258
01:40:32,425 --> 01:40:34,693
I, Leonard Allen Cantrow.

1259
01:40:34,761 --> 01:40:36,728
I, Leonard Allen Cantrow--

1260
01:40:36,796 --> 01:40:38,897
The Lord bless you and keep you.

1261
01:40:38,965 --> 01:40:41,600
The Lord make the light
of his countenance to shine upon you...

1262
01:40:41,668 --> 01:40:46,105
and give you peace both now and forever.

1263
01:40:46,172 --> 01:40:48,107
Amen.

1264
01:41:04,140 --> 01:41:06,642
- Lovely bride.
- Thank you.

1265
01:41:06,710 --> 01:41:10,545
Here we are again.
You must meet my son-in-law.

1266
01:41:10,613 --> 01:41:12,814
- How do you do?
- Hello. Hello. Thank you.

1267
01:41:12,882 --> 01:41:14,816
Here's Mr. Lindstrom.

1268
01:41:14,884 --> 01:41:17,085
- Mr. Lindstrom.
- You are the luckiest man alive.

1269
01:41:17,153 --> 01:41:19,088
Thank you.
I know it.

1270
01:41:19,155 --> 01:41:22,307
It's actually ten years old.

1271
01:41:22,375 --> 01:41:26,395
You're talking up to
$20,000 worth of land?

1272
01:41:26,462 --> 01:41:30,265
<i>I feel that so many people
are so concerned with...</i>

1273
01:41:30,333 --> 01:41:33,518
taking things out of the country...

1274
01:41:33,586 --> 01:41:37,489
rather than making a contribution
and putting things back in.

1275
01:41:37,557 --> 01:41:39,474
You know what I'm saying?

1276
01:41:39,542 --> 01:41:43,345
I think you can get a lot of satisfaction
from planting things.

1277
01:41:43,413 --> 01:41:45,915
- It's more like Thomas Jefferson, you know.
- Exactly.

1278
01:41:45,982 --> 01:41:48,967
- We visited his home in Monticello lately.
- Yes.

1279
01:41:49,035 --> 01:41:52,387
- And he said the best government
is the least government.
- Yes.

1280
01:41:52,455 --> 01:41:54,690
His way of doing was something fabulous.

1281
01:41:54,774 --> 01:41:57,208
<i>The home he designed,
very resourceful.</i>

1282
01:41:57,276 --> 01:41:59,444
<i>What business are you in?</i>

1283
01:41:59,512 --> 01:42:02,364
We make food for veal calves.

1284
01:42:02,431 --> 01:42:04,533
It's a specialty kind of food.

1285
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:07,169
It develops, uh--
A European type...

1286
01:42:07,237 --> 01:42:10,455
- Of-- of veal calf.
- Uh-huh.

1287
01:42:10,490 --> 01:42:13,025
<i>You know, I'm really
wide open as far as...</i>

1288
01:42:13,093 --> 01:42:15,944
<i>Where I might, uh, go with that.</i>

1289
01:42:16,012 --> 01:42:19,665
But insurance is a field
that's been with us almost since the--

1290
01:42:19,732 --> 01:42:22,100
- What company are you--
- It's one of the first.

1291
01:42:22,168 --> 01:42:24,169
It's called Alexander and Alexander.

1292
01:42:24,237 --> 01:42:27,022
- It's a nationwide firm.
- Nation.

1293
01:42:27,090 --> 01:42:30,609
<i>- Is that a growing field in this area?
- Oh, yes.</i>

1294
01:42:30,676 --> 01:42:34,546
- There's a lot of money in tear gas, uh--
- Yes, indeed.

1295
01:42:35,998 --> 01:42:39,518
Does your business bring you traveling?

1296
01:42:39,586 --> 01:42:43,522
There you are.
I've been looking all over the place for you.

1297
01:42:43,589 --> 01:42:46,808
- I'll be with you in a second.
- Wait a minute.

1298
01:43:04,627 --> 01:43:06,945
I would like to get back to origins.

1299
01:43:07,012 --> 01:43:09,748
I think many people don't think like this,

1300
01:43:09,815 --> 01:43:13,067
but I think we've taken enough out of
this country in many ways, you know?

1301
01:43:13,135 --> 01:43:15,353
Yeah.

1302
01:43:15,354 --> 01:43:17,572
I feel all of us should think
about putting something back in.

1303
01:43:19,008 --> 01:43:22,694
I'm in athletic equipment now, you know.

1304
01:43:24,047 --> 01:43:27,232
- It's interesting.
- Yeah.

1305
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:30,953
What are you interested
in being when you grow up?

1306
01:43:31,021 --> 01:43:34,406
Well, I haven't decided yet.

1307
01:43:34,473 --> 01:43:36,942
- How old are you?
- Ten right now.

1308
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:42,648
I was ten.

1309
01:43:45,585 --> 01:43:47,519
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

1310
01:43:47,586 --> 01:43:49,554
Come on.

1311
01:44:25,241 --> 01:44:27,008
<i># Hey, bless my soul #</i>

01:44:27,076 --> 01:44:29,010
