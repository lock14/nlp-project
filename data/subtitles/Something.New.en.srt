1
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:04,760
<i>Holla at your boy!</i>

2
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,959
<i>It's Fuzzy Fantabulous, Power
106, Big Boy's neighborhood.</i>

3
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:11,128
<i>LA, today is one of my favorite
days. You want to know why?</i>

4
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:13,604
<i>Happy Valentine's Day
to everybody.</i>

5
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,903
<i>That's right, once more again,
it's Valentine's Day.</i>

6
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:18,000
<i>Yo, check it out. I already
got some candy up here.</i>

7
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,069
<i>I got a couple of listeners
sent me some flowers.</i>

8
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:23,138
<i>I'm the luckiest dude
alive in Los Angeles.</i>

9
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,810
<i>Let me say that. Good
morning, it is a beautiful day.</i>

10
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,649
<i>For one, the sun is up,
65 degrees already outside.</i>

11
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:31,519
<i>The 405 is crowded. But who
cares? Everybody's in love today.</i>

12
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,354
<i>So they gonna get to work
when they want to.</i>

13
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,224
<i>People gonna have flowers.
Everybody is getting candy.</i>

14
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:39,754
<i>Every lady already has a date. All
the restaurants are booked tonight.</i>

15
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:43,030
<i>When I get off work, already I've
probably got four dates already lined up.</i>

16
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:47,004
<i>I got to take my moms out. My girlfriend
already sent me a bouquet of flowers.</i>

17
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:49,701
<i>And heaven knows what my wife's
got planned for me tonight.</i>

18
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,607
<i>Happy Valentine's Day.</i>

19
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,275
<i>I'll be home early.</i>

20
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,484
Good morning.
Hello.

21
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,636
Kenya.

22
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:34,738
Kenya!

23
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,842
Leah.

24
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,720
<i>Berte sent these to me today
and I don't know what to do.</i>

25
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,657
This one, I think is gonna make
me look like a fricking cow.

26
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,159
And this one I love...

27
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,389
<i>but I'm gonna have to hold
my stomach in the whole time.</i>

28
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,658
<i>Leah, wear the one you love.
It's your wedding day.</i>

29
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,393
<i>We've got to
get you married.</i>

30
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,527
<i>As my mother would say,
"There is a mensch out there...</i>

31
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,004
<i>"with your name stamped on his
forehead. " I'm sure there is.</i>

32
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,303
Who do I know for you? Who?

33
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,275
<i>Leah, don't start.
I've got a big day.</i>

34
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,313
<i>You've always got a big day. Even
on the weekends, you have a big day.</i>

35
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,177
<i>You can't let this job
be your life.</i>

36
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,649
<i>It's not my life.
I have a meeting.</i>

37
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:15,279
Brian! Tall, hot,
newly single...

38
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:18,119
architect, really smart.
This is gonna be perfect.

39
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,385
Leah, thanks, but no.

40
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,086
<i>Oh, come on.
I don't do blind dates.</i>

41
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,288
<i>Okay. I'll just add that to the
official list of things Kenya doesn't do.</i>

42
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:27,959
Which includes, among other
things, sushi, dogs, kayaking...

43
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:31,697
creepy-crawly things,
and the color red.

44
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,735
<i>Red's definitely not my color.</i>

45
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,302
Jack Pino? Kenya McQueen.

46
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,771
Hello.
Hello.

47
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:51,453
So, I looked over the letter of intent from
the bankers, and I have a few questions.

48
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:54,618
<i>Shouldn't we wait?
For?</i>

49
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,889
<i>Well, isn't someone else
coming in?</i>

50
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,329
No. This is it.

51
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,600
<i>I'm the senior manager.</i>

52
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,034
<i>When we get further into the deal I'll
bring someone in to collect documents.</i>

53
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,468
<i>But right now, it's just us.
Personal, one-on-one service.</i>

54
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,310
Okay. Sure.

55
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,552
Four Belvedere Valentinis
for four beautiful ladies.

56
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:27,718
Thank you.

57
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:28,954
I wanna make a toast.
Yes.

58
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,826
We may not have everything
we want at the moment...

59
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,422
but we do have each other.

60
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:37,697
<i>Happy Valentine's Day.
Happy Valentine's Day.</i>

61
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,930
Kenya, this is fabulous.

62
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,338
<i>Okay, let's get down to
business. Where are the brothers?</i>

63
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,603
<i>Yeah, K.
Where's the eye candy?</i>

64
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,275
<i>You got a cute-
Honey...</i>

65
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,216
Okay, Shante.

66
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,109
Oh, my God!

67
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,553
And that is why

68
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:57,884
The what?

69
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,490
have never been married.

70
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,961
<i>I read that article. It didn't
say we'd never get married.</i>

71
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,429
It just said we have yet to.

72
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,365
Okay. So when is it gonna
happen? In the afterlife? Please.

73
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,267
never get married...

74
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,498
that still means
that 57.6 of us will.

75
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,768
<i>And that's a substantially
greater percentage.</i>

76
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,572
<i>Thank you, Miss Numbers
Queen. That's very impressive.</i>

77
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,078
However, those odds
are completely against us.

78
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:24,810
It says the phenomenon is most
acute among African-American woman...

79
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,715
who are
educated professionals.

80
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,414
Judge, accountant,
banker, pediatrician.

81
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,751
<i>That'd be us.</i>

82
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,553
<i>I'm just tired of being
classified as a victim.</i>

83
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:36,686
Single black professional woman
destined to be unhappy and alone.

84
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,288
<i>I mean, I just have to keep
believing I'll find the one. True.</i>

85
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,356
<i>I don't even need all that.
I just want a good brother.</i>

86
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:42,458
<i>That's right.</i>

87
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,969
<i>He doesn't have to make a lot of
money, so long as he's got a job.</i>

88
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,095
Hallelujah.
Yes, yes.

89
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,902
He just has to be taller than me,
college educated, and not crazy.

90
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:52,240
No kids, good teeth,
and no kinky sex.

91
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:55,246
<i>I mean, I like to switch it up
a bit, but, you know...</i>

92
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,406
What?

93
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,249
<i>You're doing it again.
The list, Kenya. The list.</i>

94
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,684
You know what? You should have
stayed with Rashid Mohammed.

95
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,745
How can you do
the Muslim chauvinist thing?

96
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:06,724
Whatever, girl.
Rashid was fine. Okay?

97
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:11,594
I would have been a bean-pie
eating, mosque-going...

98
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:15,259
walking five steps behind
his behind, wearing a burka.

99
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:20,068
<i>Listen, I've been listening to
this new CD by Dr. LaWanda Phillips.</i>

100
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:23,040
Now, she says that if we keep hanging
onto this preconceived notion...

101
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,576
of what we think we want...

102
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:28,102
<i>we're actually cutting ourselves
off from our universal abundance.</i>

103
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:31,241
See, we hold on so tight...

104
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,785
to this image that we have
of our IBM...

105
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,354
<i>"Ideal Black Man. "</i>

106
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:39,081
<i>But she says that
we've got to let go...</i>

107
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,786
in order to let love flow.

108
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:45,262
<i>In fact that's what it is
called. "Let go, let flow. "</i>

109
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,925
That means you, Kenya.
No more lists.

110
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:51,733
<i>"Let go, let flow. "
That's right.</i>

111
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,331
<i>Yes, and it's a whole lot
better than, "Keep hope alive. "</i>

112
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,101
<i>Okay, y'all.</i>

113
00:07:57,176 --> 00:08:00,009
Let go, let flow. This
universe is listening.

114
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,512
Perfect, my loves.
Yes.

115
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,105
So, as long as he is
black and fine.

116
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:05,776
<i>And educated,
well-spoken, with a job.</i>

117
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,649
<i>With
a well-paying job.</i>

118
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,619
<i>You have one new message...</i>

119
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:20,559
<i>Kenya, it's Rashid.
Happy Valentine's day.</i>

120
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,828
<i>You've been on my mind a lot.</i>

121
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,735
<i>I wanted you to know
that I'm getting married.</i>

122
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,005
<i>Yeah, she is wonderful.</i>

123
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,735
<i>I met her
at a Farrakhan rally.</i>

124
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,107
<i>Kenya, I just really want
you to come to the wedding...</i>

125
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,338
Hello.

126
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,079
<i>Happy
Valentine's day, sweet pea.</i>

127
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,907
You never forget, do you?

128
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,877
<i>Forget my baby girl?
Impossible.</i>

129
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,017
Thanks, Dad.

130
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,249
<i>You sound down. Talk to me.</i>

131
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:49,556
<i>No, I'm fine.
Everything's great.</i>

132
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,590
<i>Sweet pea.
Don't give up, baby girl.</i>

133
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,832
<i>You know how to make
your dreams come true.</i>

134
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,862
Miss McQueen?

135
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:32,660
<i>Dr. Brockton,
I didn't see you.</i>

136
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,565
Looking all cute.
Thanks.

137
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,201
Brothers,
this is Kenya McQueen.

138
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,053
<i>So, how's Laurie?
She's fine.</i>

139
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:57,292
<i>Why don't you sit down
and join us? I can't.</i>

140
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,658
Meeting someone?
Oh, no.

141
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:04,260
Because a friend of mine went on one of
those Internet blind date things recently.

142
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,666
<i>Watch out. There's some
real stalkers out there.</i>

143
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:09,901
Right.

144
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,571
Good to see you.
See you.

145
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,840
Nice to meet you, Kenya.
Good to see you.

146
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,905
<i>You wouldn't be waiting
for someone by any chance.</i>

147
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,738
Someone named Brian?

148
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:47,603
Why?

149
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,444
<i>I'm him. I'm Brian, actually.</i>

150
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,006
Are you Kenya?

151
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:55,212
<i>Brian... Brian Kelly?
Yeah.</i>

152
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,187
Blind date Brian Kelly?

153
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,731
<i>I'm sorry.
It's that bad, huh?</i>

154
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,461
Obviously, you were expecting
someone else.

155
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,559
No.

156
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,433
Leah described you perfectly.

157
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:14,967
<i>She's funny.</i>

158
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,373
<i>Well, she said nothing but
great things about you, so...</i>

159
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,933
Should we sit?

160
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:20,737
Sure.

161
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,145
<i>Let's see if we can find a table. Great.</i>

162
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:29,011
How you doing, brother?
Magic treating you okay?

163
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,578
Never met him.

164
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:45,232
<i>They're all taken, so...
Here's one. Just here.</i>

165
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,566
Girl, you are
wearing those dreads.

166
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,601
<i>All right...</i>

167
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:05,223
Uncomfortable?
No. Why would you say that?

168
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:09,193
<i>Well, you're talking to strangers,
making sure everyone knows you're down.</i>

169
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,202
So, you ever been
on a blind date before?

170
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,532
My first.

171
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,098
<i>Why'd you do it?</i>

172
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,070
<i>I don't know. I...</i>

173
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,439
<i>promised my girlfriends
I'd be more open.</i>

174
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,043
But not this open.

175
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,125
What?
Nothing.

176
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:55,707
You know what? It was
really great meeting you...

177
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,675
but I kind of,
need to get going.

178
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,268
<i>I've got a crazy week
coming up. So much work to do.</i>

179
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,473
But really, it was really
- Nice meeting me.

180
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,778
Nice meeting you.
Yeah, really.

181
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,078
You, too.

182
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,620
Really.
No, really.

183
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,086
Bye.
Bye.

184
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,687
What was Leah
thinking?

185
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,094
I mean, I guess
she meant well, but come on.

186
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,656
<i>Yeah. Let's go. We just got here.</i>

187
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,965
You got something else to do? Yes.
I could be at home pleasuring myself.

188
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,368
Hello.
Hi.

189
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:27,632
Lovely party.

190
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:31,437
Can you believe this place?
The azaleas, the lavender.

191
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,105
Look at that fountain.

192
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,511
You know they flew that
tile in from somewhere.

193
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,606
<i>Whoever did
the landscaping...</i>

194
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,548
Champagne.
Thank God.

195
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,550
Thank you.

196
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,750
Leah sure can throw
an engagement party.

197
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,315
<i>Something's cooking
in the kitchen.</i>

198
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,921
See, now, why do I always get the
ones in the aprons or the uniforms...

199
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,588
with the nametags on them?

200
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,429
<i>Am I wearing a sign that says,
"all need apply"?</i>

201
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,392
<i>Who's ready for something
hot and sweet?</i>

202
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:03,202
<i>But then again,
"Let go, let flow. " Huh?</i>

203
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:07,011
<i>Excuse me. Cheryl,
don't leave me out here.</i>

204
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:10,640
Hello. How you doing? How are you?

205
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,807
<i>I'm Walter.
Pleasure to meet you.</i>

206
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,752
<i>I'm Cheryl. Nice to
meet you. Hello, Cheryl.</i>

207
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,654
What are you cooking?
My specialty.

208
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,919
<i>I'm ready for something
hot and sweet.</i>

209
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,187
<i>You'd like to taste one?</i>

210
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,558
Yes.
No problem.

211
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,848
I call it my wishing
fountain. You like it?

212
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:54,324
Mrs. Cahan.
Congratulations.

213
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,951
Thank you. And please,
call me Winnie.

214
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,962
<i>You're like practically
part of the family.</i>

215
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,193
Your house is amazing.
And I love the landscaping.

216
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,495
Thank you. Thank you.

217
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,059
<i>I just bought my first house,
and I can't wait to landscape.</i>

218
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:07,537
Well, congratulations. Then
you must meet our landscaper.

219
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,233
<i>I don't think he'd do a job
as small as mine.</i>

220
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:12,209
Well, no, we just have to ask him.
Brian, sweetie, could you come here?

221
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,973
<i>You know what?
That's okay, I'm not ready.</i>

222
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,709
No. Brian, this is a very good friend
- Kenya, yes. We met.

223
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,683
Right. I thought
you were an architect.

224
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,946
Landscape architect.

225
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,387
Well, Kenya just bought her first house
and she wants to do some landscaping.

226
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,549
So maybe you could go take a
look at it for her, sweetie.

227
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,092
<i>Or recommend someone
if you're too busy.</i>

228
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,355
<i>Well, I think Kenya is
probably the one who's too busy.</i>

229
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,159
<i>I'm sure she has time. She was
just raving about your work.</i>

230
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,256
Really?

231
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,198
It is nice.
Thank you.

232
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,997
Brian, she needs you.

233
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,699
<i>If you'll excuse me, I have to go
remind my daughter she's still a Cahan.</i>

234
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,072
You look beautiful. Thank you.

235
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:49,405
<i>Listen, I just have a small backyard
and I don't really have a budget, so...</i>

236
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:52,109
Well, small is okay.
Business is business.

237
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:56,644
<i>No pressure, but if
you're ever ready, call me.</i>

238
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,487
Take care.

239
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,875
What are you doing?

240
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,361
<i>You'll have to leave him
in the car. I don't do dogs.</i>

241
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,558
<i>Well, neither do I.
We're just good friends.</i>

242
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,194
I guess I walked
right into that one.

243
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,703
<i>Hi, how are you?
I'm good.</i>

244
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:20,864
<i>So, you don't do dogs,
huh?</i>

245
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,305
<i>I mean, I can't have dog
hair all over my house.</i>

246
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,900
<i>I hope it's not an imposition.
No, I got it. I got it.</i>

247
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,106
<i>Hear that, Max? She doesn't do dogs.
So you have to wait in the truck. Okay?</i>

248
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,546
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

249
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,210
Skiddley-Max! Go on, Max!
In the truck!

250
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,912
<i>There's a good boy.</i>

251
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,317
<i>He's a good boy.</i>

252
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,686
<i>It's around the back.
Got you.</i>

253
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,028
Listen, thanks for
coming out here...

254
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:49,067
and not, you know, holding
my rudeness against me.

255
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,799
I appreciate you saying that.

256
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,904
So, what do you think?

257
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:09,882
<i>Well...</i>

258
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,205
<i>One thing's certain.</i>

259
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,676
You need me.

260
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,311
<i>Now, I'm just gonna
throw around some ideas...</i>

261
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:39,646
<i>but I saw you checking out
Mrs. Cahan's fountain...</i>

262
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:43,017
so I figure the focal point
has gotta be a fountain.

263
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,413
Fountain? I love that.
Good.

264
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:46,822
<i>But, I can't.</i>

265
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,689
The electricity, the cost-

266
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,194
Oh, no, we can make it work.
You gotta have a fountain.

267
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,596
<i>You come home from a hard day's
work. You lay back on your chaise.</i>

268
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,032
You listen to the sounds of
the water, have a glass of wine.

269
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:03,167
Now, this, are you married
to this? No. Not at all.

270
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,733
<i>All right,
the tub's gone. Path.</i>

271
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,638
And I was thinking we could build
some kind of a structure here.

272
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,548
Drape it in
bougainvillea or...

273
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,218
wisteria.

274
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,922
<i>I like that. It's pretty.</i>

275
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,519
You should see this job that I
just finished. It turned out great.

276
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:25,689
I covered the patio and the walls
with this richly-hued flagstone.

277
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:30,128
I did some interesting things
with the lighting and stereo.

278
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,831
<i>I'd love to see it.</i>

279
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,168
Well, what are you doing
right now? I can take you by.

280
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,433
Now?
Yeah.

281
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:39,409
<i>I can't. I've got way too much work
to do. Do you have any pictures of it?</i>

282
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,446
<i>Pictures wouldn't
do it justice.</i>

283
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,242
<i>Well, today is out.
I'm swamped.</i>

284
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:44,543
<i>It's just in Los Feliz.</i>

285
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,380
I can take you straight there and
bring you straight back. Promise.

286
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,700
Gorgeous day.

287
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,973
Hey, you mind if I make a quick
stop at the community garden?

288
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,103
A quick what?

289
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,739
<i>We're right here.
Just dropping something off.</i>

290
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,655
<i>I'll be real quick.</i>

291
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,718
You can come in
if you want.

292
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,524
Maria, look what
I got for you.

293
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,724
<i>Mijo!
Hey!</i>

294
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,324
<i>Nice seeing you, Mijo.
You, too.</i>

295
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,596
<i>How you been?
Más o menos.</i>

296
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,934
The business has been
good though.

297
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,065
I hear about Penelope.
Yeah.

298
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:44,631
<i>She's a bitch.</i>

299
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:47,841
Did you see it coming?
Yeah, I guess, you know.

300
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,038
How?

301
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,273
Well, Maria. Honestly?

302
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,114
<i>Penelope is great. She is.
She's just not great with me.</i>

303
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,780
MARIA Are you okay?
Yeah.

304
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,722
She is cute.

305
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,521
<i>There's a spider in my hair. What?</i>

306
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,858
<i>There's a spider in my hair. Wait.</i>

307
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,024
Get it off! Get it off!
Get it off! Wait, wait.

308
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,897
<i>There's nothing there.</i>

309
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,459
Just breathe. Just breathe.
Breathe, breathe.

310
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,027
Breathe, breathe.

311
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,641
Breathe, breathe.

312
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,303
<i>You must think
I'm a freak.</i>

313
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,782
<i>No. Not at all.
You just don't do spiders.</i>

314
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,016
Or dogs.

315
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:30,782
<i>There's a whole list.
You have no idea.</i>

316
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,088
You know...

317
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:38,160
I could draw up some kind of a
proposal and submit it to you.

318
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,095
<i>And then
the ball's in your court.</i>

319
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:44,397
If you have any questions or ideas,
just give me a call, anytime. All right?

320
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,664
<i>I... I have to
think about it.</i>

321
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:49,901
<i>I'm still getting my head
around the mortgage.</i>

322
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,203
No pressure.

323
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:53,503
Okay.

324
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,340
Thanks.

325
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,981
Good night. Sleep tight.

326
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,278
Okay.

327
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:05,448
<i>Don't let the spiders bite.</i>

328
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:14,925
Kenya?

329
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,366
I brought you a little
present for the Pino account.

330
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,097
Excellent. My very own
personal computer.

331
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,367
Bill Lebree.

332
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,966
<i>Welcome aboard. I'll put you
right to work. I'm at your service.</i>

333
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,068
<i>I'll have the engagement
letters, the procedures...</i>

334
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:28,407
and the request lists
around 3:00.

335
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,040
<i>And I'll need them back by
Thursday, no later than 10:00, 10:30.</i>

336
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:33,448
And in the meantime,
you can look these over...

337
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,385
and get a breakdown of the
depreciation and amortization.

338
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:37,945
Got it. No problem.

339
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,048
<i>Anything else you need,
I'm here.</i>

340
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,456
Thank you.

341
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,854
Now, Kenya-

342
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,328
Edwin, I know how important
this account is.

343
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,989
<i>Don't worry.
I'm not worried.</i>

344
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:48,794
We have complete confidence
in you.

345
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,802
<i>That's why you're being
considered for partner.</i>

346
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,098
Fantastic.

347
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:54,968
Contingent, of course,
on the Pino account.

348
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,302
<i>I'll do it.</i>

349
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,843
Well, this is
certainly good news.

350
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,241
Just wait till
the gray hairs come...

351
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,337
and you have to schedule
in time to see your spouse.

352
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:03,711
I look forward to that.

353
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,478
For Miss Kenya McQueen,
via messenger.

354
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,813
For me?

355
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,820
Your birthday?
No.

356
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,223
<i>Who's it from?</i>

357
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,596
My new landscaper.

358
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,663
No! Go! No! Go!

359
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,499
Max, Max! Get out of there!
Get back in the truck.

360
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,903
Get in the truck!
Skiddley-Max!

361
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,941
<i>Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. He must have...
He must have snuck out of the truck.</i>

362
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:37,914
<i>Well, please do everything you
can to make sure that he doesn't.</i>

363
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,348
Yeah. Okay.

364
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,251
I spilled your latte.

365
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,602
<i>Thanks for the latte.
It's real sweet.</i>

366
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:10,307
No foam, extra hot.
I was making one for myself.

367
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,077
<i>That's really nice.</i>

368
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,380
<i>So when do you think
you're gonna be done?</i>

369
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,581
<i>Well, we've only been here two
days. You sick of us already?</i>

370
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,248
<i>No, I was...</i>

371
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,325
<i>I was thinking that
maybe when you're done...</i>

372
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:23,952
I could have a party
out here.

373
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,088
A housewarming?
Yeah.

374
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,598
<i>Yeah, I think
that's a great idea.</i>

375
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,294
You need to relax.

376
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:33,570
Does it show?

377
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:39,377
<i>You know, it's Saturday,
you're wearing a suit and...</i>

378
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:46,574
<i>I've got to go in.
I've got a lot on my plate.</i>

379
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,119
<i>I just found out
I'm up for partner.</i>

380
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:52,418
<i>Partner, huh? Wow, that's quite
an achievement. Congratulations.</i>

381
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,187
<i>Well, it hasn't happened yet. It will.</i>

382
00:24:58,196 --> 00:24:59,788
Better get back.

383
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,932
Hey, what are you
doing here on a Saturday?

384
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,306
I got a job to do...

385
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,842
for a hardworking lady
that deserves a party.

386
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,675
Thank you.

387
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:55,009
What?

388
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:56,813
What?

389
00:25:58,423 --> 00:25:59,651
Hi.
Hi.

390
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,825
<i>What's up with Iron Johnny,
over there?</i>

391
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,453
Hi, there.
Hi.

392
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:09,463
My bad. Stacy, my sister
Kenya. Kenya, Stacy.

393
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,661
<i>It's such an honor. Really.</i>

394
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,737
<i>Here's the money for
Mom's birthday. Good.</i>

395
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:17,365
I got the tool
for this job.

396
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:19,535
<i>You didn't tell me
you were landscaping.</i>

397
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:22,205
Am I required
to tell you everything?

398
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:26,211
Brian, this is
my baby brother, Nelson.

399
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:29,050
Nice to meet you, man.

400
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:31,980
<i>What's happening?</i>

401
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,491
Forgive him.
He was born arrogant.

402
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,583
<i>It's the help.</i>

403
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:38,718
Nelson!
What?

404
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:44,593
<i>By the way,
what's this I hear?</i>

405
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:46,432
You skiing the slopes?

406
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:51,273
Are you sneaking off
to the OC?

407
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,841
Are you sleeping
with the enemy?

408
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,471
It was a blind date.

409
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,138
<i>I didn't know.</i>

410
00:26:58,683 --> 00:26:59,945
Why did I tell you that?

411
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,543
<i>Blind date? Blind...
That is wrong!</i>

412
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,886
My sister should be going out on a
blind date with a white boy in the-

413
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:09,620
<i>No! 'Cause you are not that
desperate! What is the matter with you?</i>

414
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:13,055
<i>I just don't want
everyone knowing my business.</i>

415
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,828
This is so awesome!

416
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,596
Your first, very own house. Thank you.

417
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,770
<i>Can I use
the little girls' room?</i>

418
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:23,137
<i>Yeah.
It's right through there.</i>

419
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:28,608
I hope she has
a magic coochie.

420
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,114
<i>Don't even go there,
Miss Blind Date.</i>

421
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:34,583
As a matter of fact, you should get
yourself a little something-something.

422
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,588
<i>I'm gonna hook you up.
With your friends? Please.</i>

423
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,750
Kenya, you need to
make yourself more available.

424
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,552
What does that mean?
Interested.

425
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:46,024
Open. Spontaneous.

426
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:48,292
You need to let your guard
down every once in a while.

427
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,231
I tried. It backfired.

428
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,569
Baby, could you
do me a favor?

429
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:56,198
Could you give my sister some
tips on how to catch a man?

430
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,832
Sure. I can give you
some pointers.

431
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,044
You need to get
a good nutritionist.

432
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:03,478
<i>You'd be amazed
what a little diet can do.</i>

433
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:05,209
It changed my life.

434
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:07,513
Thank you.
Thank you.

435
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,314
So, where did you guys meet, anyway?

436
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:10,649
I was driving...

437
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,952
and Nelson pulls up next
to me in his brand new Jag.

438
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:16,357
<i>And I was like, "Oh my God,
an XJS! This is not happening!"</i>

439
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,225
Shut up!
No, you shut up.

440
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:21,163
No, you shut up.
No, you shut up.

441
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:23,826
So, when are you gonna let me
test drive that thing, anyway?

442
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,665
Never. Never, ever.

443
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,932
I would never ever
let you drive my whip.

444
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:32,934
So, I want to use a mixture of California
natives and different perennials...

445
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,707
to try and create
a Mediterranean feel.

446
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,810
You good with that?

447
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:39,813
<i>I don't know
one from the other.</i>

448
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:43,285
Well, a California native obviously
grows best in this environment.

449
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:47,415
<i>And perennials, well, they're just
flowering plants, they bloom seasonally.</i>

450
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,983
They shift the energy
and the mood for the garden.

451
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,858
Here, check this out.

452
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:56,058
Mediterranean lavender,
you gotta have it.

453
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,964
It has healing qualities.
Yeah.

454
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:01,096
In ancient times, it was
used to honor the gods.

455
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:07,169
<i>How'd you get into this,
anyway? It was my dad.</i>

456
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:10,176
Everywhere we lived,
he had a garden.

457
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,978
<i>And every spring, he'd make
me help him plant stuff.</i>

458
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:16,077
At first I hated it. Then after
a while I kind of got into it.

459
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:19,590
I was the only 12-year-old on my block
who knew how to take care of cymbidiums.

460
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:23,115
So at 12 you found your calling?
Oh, no. It was a winding road.

461
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:26,755
After college, I worked in
an ad agency as a copywriter.

462
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,958
I did that
for six long years.

463
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,466
An ad man, huh?

464
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:33,436
<i>Yeah. Suit, tie,
the whole thing. I...</i>

465
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,204
I hated it.

466
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:39,407
Then one day I took a cymbidium
into my cubicle at the agency.

467
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:42,207
Before too long
the plants just took over.

468
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,909
I started spending more time
caring for them than working.

469
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,143
It just clicked.

470
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,449
So, what do you think of this,
for ground cover?

471
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,051
Yeah, it looks good.
Great.

472
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:06,201
<i>There's my sweet pea!</i>

473
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:08,739
Do you two always
have to make a scene?

474
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,332
Happy birthday, Mother.
Thank you, sweetheart.

475
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:14,037
<i>Here's Nelson!
Hi, sweetie.</i>

476
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,841
Good to see you, Son.
Father.

477
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,378
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

478
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:26,719
Kiki, these are my folks.
Doctor and Mrs. McQueen.

479
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:27,849
KIKl: Nice to meet you.

480
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,951
<i>And that's my sister Kenya.
Kenya, this is Kiki.</i>

481
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:31,154
Hi, nice to meet you.

482
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,720
<i>Your dress,
it's very unique.</i>

483
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:35,891
You like it? I made it myself.

484
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,525
<i>I didn't sew it.
It just clips.</i>

485
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,695
What happened to the one
with the implants? Stacy?

486
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,671
Kiki happened to Stacy.

487
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,169
Hey guys, how was your
little trip to La Quinta?

488
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:49,304
Fine. Of course, for a three-day
trip, your mother packed five bags.

489
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,440
Now, come on.
It was a spa weekend.

490
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,246
I had to have choices.

491
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,720
<i>And besides, one of the bags
was your father's golf bag.</i>

492
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,848
So, Kiki,
what do you do?

493
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:04,384
<i>I work at the copy shop right now. But
this fall I'll be going to design school.</i>

494
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,988
<i>Well, we're a family of academics,
as I'm sure Nelson has told you.</i>

495
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:12,002
Dr. McQueen here is the head
of neurosurgery at Cedars Sinai.

496
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,298
Enough, Joyce.

497
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:17,068
My daughter, soon to be made
partner at Bailey, Banks and Biddle.

498
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,268
Benson, Baily
and Becks, Mother.

499
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:20,811
Right, Becks, yes.

500
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,074
And we are so proud
of our dear Nelson...

501
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:26,947
who has just joined the legal
department at 20th Century Fox.

502
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:30,080
Legal Department? I
thought you were a producer.

503
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:31,678
Good Lord, no!

504
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,920
He graduated
top of his law school class.

505
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:38,258
That Jag was a graduation
present from Dr. McQueen.

506
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,996
Your daddy bought you
that Jag?

507
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:52,370
Mommy, Kenya is dating
white boys now.

508
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,672
I had one blind date...

509
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:01,550
and nothing came of it, except
I hired him as my landscaper.

510
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:04,082
<i>She's landscaping.</i>

511
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:06,350
So, it was
Iron Johnny, huh?

512
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,449
See, I knew there was
something about that dude.

513
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:11,427
<i>Actually he's really nice, and
we're having a really great time.</i>

514
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:14,465
<i>Ma! You're having a
great time landscaping?</i>

515
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,207
Burning the midnight oil?

516
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:09,803
<i>I'm just trying to
keep up with you.</i>

517
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,316
Wow, nice.

518
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,542
<i>It's really coming along.</i>

519
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,756
Max, get over here. Max.

520
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,155
<i>It's okay.</i>

521
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:35,528
<i>I'm starving.</i>

522
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,436
Want some takeout?

523
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,408
<i>What's with
all the beige?</i>

524
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:51,313
<i>You are gonna paint, right?
You're gonna bring some color in?</i>

525
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:54,715
<i>What's wrong with beige?</i>

526
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,157
<i>Well, it's...</i>

527
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:58,155
safe...

528
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:00,621
and impersonal.

529
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:03,098
It kind of feels
a little like a hotel.

530
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,434
<i>It doesn't reflect you.</i>

531
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:11,569
My mother thinks bright colors
are for children and whores.

532
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,204
What do you think?

533
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,204
<i>I don't know.</i>

534
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:21,784
See, I think
color brings in energy.

535
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,384
It excites the senses.

536
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,116
I mean, it can make you feel
sad, it can make you feel happy.

537
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,589
It can make you feel bold.

538
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:29,683
No, bold is
definitely not me.

539
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,250
Are you sure?

540
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:34,257
<i>I don't think you take the
time to know who you are.</i>

541
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,197
<i>You're always working.</i>

542
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:41,037
Yeah. Well, some of us have to work
extra hard just to stay in the game.

543
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:44,067
<i>You wouldn't understand.</i>

544
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,336
Try me.

545
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:48,637
<i>You're so full of advice
tonight, Mr. Know Everything.</i>

546
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:51,739
<i>Maybe it's time I give you
some. All right, fire away.</i>

547
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,216
<i>Well, for one,
you're a lousy businessman.</i>

548
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:56,150
<i>You didn't ask
for an upfront payment.</i>

549
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,212
<i>And you've already put in too many
hours to make this job cost-effective.</i>

550
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:03,056
Did it ever occur to you that I
was giving you special treatment?

551
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:06,062
I may not be the financial
wizard, like yourself...

552
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:10,658
but I have been running a small business,
successfully, for over six years.

553
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:15,099
Of course, if you feel the
urge to review my books...

554
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,698
then please, do me the favor.

555
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,870
<i>I'll allow that.</i>

556
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:22,344
<i>Trust me,
you couldn't afford me.</i>

557
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:34,486
<i>So, I take it
you don't do white guys.</i>

558
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,764
I just happen
to prefer black men.

559
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,398
<i>It's not a prejudice,
it is a preference.</i>

560
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:49,306
<i>Sure. It's your preference
to be prejudiced.</i>

561
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,602
What about you?
Women are women.

562
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:55,607
Some are poison,
some are sweet.

563
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,944
Ever date a black girl?
All kinds of girls.

564
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:00,176
<i>So you're a player.
No.</i>

565
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,284
<i>I'm just...</i>

566
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,082
Just a landscaper.

567
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:09,088
I take hard earth
and make things bloom.

568
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,194
<i>Speaking of which,
it's late.</i>

569
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:19,667
You need a hand with
this? No, thank you.

570
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:23,001
<i>Well, thanks for dinner. You're welcome.</i>

571
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,167
<i>And I guess
I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

572
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:35,176
Bye.

573
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:21,159
I let the guys go early
for the holiday.

574
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:24,262
<i>So, I'm gonna head off, too. Okay.</i>

575
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:27,495
<i>There's just one thing.
You're coming with me.</i>

576
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:31,303
Why? Do we have something else
to buy for the yard?

577
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,002
<i>No, we're going hiking.</i>

578
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:34,772
Just a day trip,
nothing major.

579
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:39,207
<i>Are you asking me out on a date?
I'm asking you to go hiking.</i>

580
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:43,049
<i>Well, then the answer is double
no. I don't even like hiking.</i>

581
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:48,453
Heads or tails?

582
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:54,029
Who in their right mind would
go out in heat like this?

583
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:55,755
I mean, what is the point?

584
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,028
<i>Don't look down, look up.
Look at the mountains.</i>

585
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:59,569
<i>I'm looking
for rattlesnakes.</i>

586
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:02,504
<i>Don't worry about rattlesnakes.
The mountain lions eat most of them.</i>

587
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:03,938
Very funny.

588
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,965
Uh-oh.
Shit! My hair!

589
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:14,244
<i>I'm gonna kill you! I swear,
I didn't see it coming.</i>

590
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:20,833
<i>Don't think this is going
any further, because it's not.</i>

591
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:24,078
Good night.

592
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,761
<i>Why'd they
name you Kenya?</i>

593
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,232
I was born there.

594
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:27,307
My father was into world
healthcare for a few years.

595
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:30,646
My mother wanted
to name me Tiffany.

596
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:35,174
<i>She hated East Africa. Couldn't
wait to get back to the States.</i>

597
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,783
How come?

598
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:39,486
<i>I don't know.
She's my mother.</i>

599
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,416
<i>There weren't enough places
to shop.</i>

600
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:49,757
Also, I had really bad
asthma when I was little.

601
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:52,461
<i>She didn't trust
the hospitals there.</i>

602
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,829
Asthma?

603
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,270
<i>So that's why
you hate bugs...</i>

604
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:00,140
spiders...

605
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:03,139
and tall grass...

606
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,044
and hiking.

607
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:07,310
Yeah, I was
pretty sheltered.

608
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:16,623
Little Kenya stuck inside
while the other kids play.

609
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:19,595
Drawing her pictures...

610
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:24,493
and muttering
her equations.

611
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:27,899
<i>You think I'm pathetic,
don't you? No, I don't.</i>

612
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:32,809
<i>I think you're adorable.</i>

613
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:38,904
Just adorable.

614
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:49,356
Can I ask you
one more question?

615
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,865
Can you take this off?

616
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,563
What do you mean?

617
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,473
<i>I mean,
it's not a wig, right?</i>

618
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:09,244
<i>But it's not your real
hair either, is it?</i>

619
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:14,607
<i>I can't believe you just asked me
that. I'm sorry. I'm just curious.</i>

620
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:16,949
It is a weave,
if you must know.

621
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:18,420
I thought
you dated black girls.

622
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,218
They had real hair.
I have real hair, too.

623
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:21,814
Underneath?
Yes, underneath!

624
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:24,918
<i>So, what? They just... They
sew it in? Something like that.</i>

625
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:27,760
You know what?
I think you should leave.

626
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,425
<i>This isn't gonna work. I
don't know what I was thinking.</i>

627
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,935
It was a really, really
stupid mistake. Now please go.

628
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,995
<i>What? 'Cause I asked about your
hair? Because of everything.</i>

629
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:39,107
And furthermore,
effective today...

630
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:42,304
I will no longer be needing
your services as a landscaper.

631
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:45,940
<i>Yeah, you're a piece
of work, Kenya McQueen.</i>

632
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,108
Get out!

633
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:50,550
Sorry if I offended you.

634
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:54,216
<i>I just... I was just wondering what
you'd look like completely naked.</i>

635
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:01,860
You did what?
With who?

636
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:04,696
<i>I know. But...</i>

637
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:07,303
It was raining,
and we were hiking.

638
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,965
You were hiking? And we
just got carried away.

639
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,167
All right.
Well, can he bone?

640
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:13,766
Nedra!
What?

641
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,505
<i>Don't be so crass!
Oh, please!</i>

642
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:16,978
Well, can he?
See.

643
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,140
Well, yes.

644
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:21,810
<i>Now you're talking, girl. He got a big
- Yes.</i>

645
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:23,685
<i>But it's over.</i>

646
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:25,314
<i>It's over.</i>

647
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:27,954
It was a one time thing.
In fact, I fired him.

648
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,959
Kenya, you did what?
It was never gonna work.

649
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:31,460
Well, of course not, fool!

650
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:33,621
<i>You don't have to marry
him! Marry him, honey.</i>

651
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:36,188
All you are doing is just having-
Some good old-fashioned sex.

652
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:39,861
For once in your tired sappy
life. You need to let it flow.

653
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,976
Take it out.

654
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:17,306
Just getting
the rest of my stuff.

655
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:20,340
I knew it.

656
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:22,804
What?

657
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:25,439
<i>You're gorgeous.</i>

658
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:30,346
<i>Don't worry
about the balance.</i>

659
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,512
Wait.

660
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:35,920
<i>Don't go.</i>

661
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,825
<i>I know
you're sensitive about color.</i>

662
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:48,065
<i>So we'll just take it slow.</i>

663
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:53,843
<i>No one has to know
if you don't want them to.</i>

664
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,643
<i>It'll just be
our little secret.</i>

665
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:52,595
<i>Don't move.</i>

666
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:54,993
<i>Yes. You can't tell me that white people
don't have a special thing for dogs.</i>

667
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:56,464
Dog hotels, dog shrinks.

668
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,967
You know, you kiss them in the
mouth. You let them sleep with you.

669
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:00,697
I mean,
look at you and Max.

670
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,205
<i>I mean, you have your own
language. "Skiddley-wags. "</i>

671
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,969
<i>Skiddley-Max. It's
Skiddley-Max. Okay, sorry.</i>

672
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:08,204
<i>Okay? Sorry,
Max. It's okay.</i>

673
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:11,873
Your neighbor, Lillian. And
Miss Selina? I mean, come on.

674
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:14,242
Every day that dog
has on a new dress.

675
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:17,014
I mean, I swear, she even
puts lipstick on that dog.

676
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:19,555
<i>Miss Lillian doesn't count.
Yeah, well, I'm not buying that.</i>

677
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,955
<i>I'm just not gonna buy it.
Here, taste this.</i>

678
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:27,927
Can you just do that
one more time?

679
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:30,559
<i>Yeah. That's what
I'm talking about.</i>

680
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,364
<i>You've gotta take your time and
just appreciate certain things.</i>

681
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:35,735
Like, ladies, look at all the
beautiful black men in here.

682
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,900
Just give all the black men
a round of applause in here.

683
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,845
<i>I'm talking about
fine brothers up in here.</i>

684
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:45,607
<i>'Cause, you know why I'm
particularly fond of the black man?</i>

685
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:48,378
Because society is
just so hard on the black man.

686
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:50,317
<i>All they say is, "The black
man don't wanna work. "</i>

687
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:52,787
<i>Then, when they do work, "They don't
wanna take care of their kids. "</i>

688
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:55,324
<i>Then when have kids, "They don't
spend no quality time with them. "</i>

689
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:58,054
But when they bring that to
me, you know what I tell them?

690
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:00,653
Well, what about
the DC Sniper?

691
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:05,130
This man spent
quality time with his son.

692
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:07,295
Took him to work with him.

693
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:09,271
Taught him how to hunt.

694
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,370
<i>You just can't judge a whole race
of men by one incident, you know.</i>

695
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:16,470
I love my black brothers.

696
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:18,571
<i>That's why I ain't never dated
outside of my race.</i>

697
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:20,513
Never dated outside
of my race. Never.

698
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:23,052
Well, yes I did.
Yes, I did. Yes, I did.

699
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,088
I dated an African once.

700
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:30,020
Baby, he did it to me so good, I
woke up with my hair braided, baby.

701
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:31,424
It was bad.

702
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:33,759
<i>But I ain't never dated
a white man before.</i>

703
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:36,025
<i>Not that I'm not
attracted to white men.</i>

704
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:38,090
<i>'Cause there's some
fine-looking white men in here.</i>

705
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:40,136
But my only problem
with the white man is that...

706
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,694
<i>y'all don't know
how to break up with a woman.</i>

707
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:45,332
I watch The Crime Channel.

708
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:49,068
<i>You date them, you come
up missing, don't you?</i>

709
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:50,908
Everybody will be
looking for you.

710
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:53,848
<i>You'll be chopped up, in the
freezer, in a sandwich bag...</i>

711
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:56,351
<i>with a "barbeque" sign
on your head.</i>

712
00:50:56,686 --> 00:51:00,315
<i>Y'all, my name is Sommore.
Y'all have been great. Thank you.</i>

713
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:13,533
<i>Wow, we've been to New Orleans,
Charleston, the wine country.</i>

714
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:15,901
You know where there is
good food, Walter will travel.

715
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:17,769
<i>Yeah.
He's a true foodie.</i>

716
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:21,106
<i>And I've gained five pounds,
but I'm having a ball.</i>

717
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:23,442
Hear ye! Hear ye!

718
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:26,275
<i>Madam Judge here, would you'd
ever thought she'd fall...</i>

719
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:28,078
for somebody with an apron?
Come on, Kenya.

720
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:30,984
<i>Well, you showed me the light.
Didn't you?</i>

721
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:40,892
Well, looks like you two
have been having fun.

722
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:42,955
<i>And plus, I can't even
reach Kenya.</i>

723
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,126
She used to pick up on the
first ring. So, do share.

724
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:48,638
<i>Well, I've been...
- I have a big account right now. So...</i>

725
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,033
Yeah.

726
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:53,602
Kenya.

727
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:57,171
<i>Admit it, girl. You're
having fun. I can tell.</i>

728
00:51:57,247 --> 00:52:00,944
Oh, wait. And before I forget,
I got this on our last trip.

729
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:04,481
<i>And now that you're into colors, I
thought you might be able to use it.</i>

730
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:07,614
<i>Thank you.
You're welcome.</i>

731
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,892
<i>It's beautiful.
It's beautiful.</i>

732
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:12,894
<i>That's my song. Come
on, let's dance. Okay.</i>

733
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,761
<i>Come on, y'all.
Shake a tail feather now.</i>

734
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:38,311
So, I hear you into gardening.

735
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:40,117
<i>Yeah, yeah, that's right.</i>

736
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,090
Like that jungle variety.

737
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,753
The jungle what?
The jungle variety.

738
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:48,397
Look, man, do you do this
with all your clients?

739
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:51,025
Do you bring them out?
No, not usually. Why?

740
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:53,228
Because that woman,
you see that woman?

741
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:56,329
I love that woman.
And Kenya love that woman.

742
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:59,773
<i>She's like a sister to Kenya, so she's
kind of like a sister-in-law to me.</i>

743
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,902
<i>See what I'm saying?
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.</i>

744
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:04,845
<i>So we got her back.
She's kind of like family.</i>

745
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:08,283
You got that?
Yeah, I got it.

746
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,579
Good.

747
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:10,950
Got what?

748
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:14,615
You got what?
Got milk.

749
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:17,251
What was that about?
It was just about you.

750
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:19,695
<i>Here you go, Sommore.
I'll be up at the bar.</i>

751
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:21,196
Hey! Hey!

752
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:23,664
Hey, baby. How are you
doing? You did a good job.

753
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:25,098
<i>Thank you.
I'm glad y'all came.</i>

754
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:26,362
This is my girl, Cheryl.

755
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:27,994
Hi, how are you doing? Hi.
Hi, nice to meet you.

756
00:53:28,071 --> 00:53:29,436
<i>That's Kenya.
Hi, how are you? Hi.</i>

757
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:30,871
<i>I'm Brian.
Hi.</i>

758
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:34,035
<i>I see y'all brought
your night light with you.</i>

759
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:39,110
Girl, either you getting your swirl on or
you got your probation officer with you.

760
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:40,410
<i>Well, I don't blame you.</i>

761
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,513
I know all about
these undisclosed liabilities.

762
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:45,850
<i>And you're not concerned?</i>

763
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:48,948
<i>Well, yeah, but did you see the
receivables? They're right here.</i>

764
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:50,356
<i>Yes, I've looked them over.
Jack-</i>

765
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:53,260
Look, I really need this
IPO to happen.

766
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:56,397
I know you do, but the
deal has to make sense.

767
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,025
Look,
did you see this, Bill?

768
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:00,903
Of course,
Bill saw it.

769
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:03,166
He prepared the document
before I did the analysis.

770
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:07,199
<i>Jack, I know you're anxious about
this deal but I'm only protecting you.</i>

771
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:08,972
Jack.
Oh, Edwin.

772
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:11,138
You still owe me a
round of golf. I sure do.

773
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:13,182
<i>Listen, why don't you take
a minute and sit with us?</i>

774
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,649
<i>I'd love to,
but I have a meeting.</i>

775
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:16,743
<i>You're in good hands.
Kenya knows what she's doing.</i>

776
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:20,051
<i>Well, after your meeting, why don't
you stop back here and look at this?</i>

777
00:54:20,123 --> 00:54:22,353
Sure. Kenya, do you mind?

778
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:25,883
Not at all. Jack values your
feedback, and he should have it.

779
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:27,896
<i>We're all here
to serve the client.</i>

780
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:29,397
I believe that.

781
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:54,221
Watch this.

782
00:54:58,194 --> 00:54:59,821
Oh, my God!

783
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:02,925
Wow!

784
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,262
Brian...

785
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:09,405
this is just incredible.

786
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:14,670
<i>It's...</i>

787
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,139
everything I ever wanted...

788
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:23,515
and more.

789
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:26,519
Thank you.

790
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:37,728
Hard day?

791
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:39,997
Annoying.

792
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:43,770
This client is a trip.

793
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:46,804
I have to go back into
the office tomorrow...

794
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:49,003
<i>and he's second guessing
everything I do.</i>

795
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,980
I have to double-check
my work just in case.

796
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:54,273
That old black tax again.

797
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:57,984
Black tax?

798
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:02,949
Yeah, you have to work twice as
hard just to prove yourself equal.

799
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:05,617
<i>You sure you're not
being paranoid?</i>

800
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,262
<i>Yeah, I'm sure.</i>

801
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:10,822
<i>Okay. Then I'll work
Saturday, too.</i>

802
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:18,231
Hey.

803
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,571
<i>Don't walk up on me like that,
you don't know me.</i>

804
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:23,407
Well, I thought you could
use some help.

805
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,539
Oh, man, you trying to steal
my secrets over here.

806
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:26,843
<i>That's what you trying to do.</i>

807
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:28,941
You got me.
You got me. I admit it.

808
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:31,646
Well, you know what? You ought
to feel real, real blessed...

809
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,848
<i>that you're even invited
to this negro spiritual.</i>

810
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:35,652
<i>I am, Walter.
You know what I'm saying?</i>

811
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:38,023
Hey, Boo-boo.
Talk to you later.

812
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:43,557
Oh, hey.
You look gorgeous.

813
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:44,724
Hi.

814
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:47,869
<i>Oh, there's Leah.</i>

815
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:49,370
Leah! Paul!

816
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:50,906
Hey, Paul.
Hi.

817
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:54,501
Hi, look at you guys.
I am so psyched.

818
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,044
<i>Well, I'm so psyched
for you guys.</i>

819
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:57,841
Wedding in a few weeks.
Yeah.

820
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,347
Hey, the place looks great. Thank you.

821
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,576
I want to show you
the fountain.

822
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,948
<i>I've been telling her about
the fountain. Yeah, yeah. Great.</i>

823
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:05,817
Yeah, I really like what you did
here. Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.

824
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:08,289
<i>It's a good space to work
with. Can I get you a drink?</i>

825
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:10,223
<i>Yes, sure. We'll just have
a couple of sodas.</i>

826
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:12,284
Two sodas. Coming right up.

827
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:15,361
<i>That white guy's
really nice.</i>

828
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,927
Girl, honey,
you let go all right.

829
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:25,941
Working your natural hair,
sporting your little boy-toy.

830
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:28,443
<i>He's a doll, baby.
He's a gardener.</i>

831
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:31,537
<i>He's a good one, girl. Look
at your flowers and blooms.</i>

832
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,707
<i>Tony's cute.
Divorced.</i>

833
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:37,480
Well, not technically,
but the separation is legal.

834
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:39,249
Suzzette.
I know, you guys, please.

835
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:43,315
He came into my office
cradling that feverish child.

836
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:45,522
Those muscular arms.

837
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:49,194
<i>He said,
"Doctor, we need help. "</i>

838
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,362
What was I supposed to do?

839
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:54,164
Let go, let flow. Cheers!

840
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:56,933
<i>The reality of it is
a brother can't get no slack.</i>

841
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:58,769
Now see, if a white boy
had done that-

842
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:00,469
Oh, please. He would
have got a promotion.

843
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:01,942
<i>What I'm saying.
Give me some of that.</i>

844
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:03,876
Are you guys talking
about the black tax?

845
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:05,938
Ahem.

846
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:07,209
Drinks?

847
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:09,542
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Wait
a minute, wait a minute.

848
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:12,144
<i>My man! He's a spy.</i>

849
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:16,122
He tried to con me out of a
barbecue technique earlier today.

850
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:19,525
I guess he gonna try to open up his
own restaurant or something like that.

851
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:23,893
<i>No. I'll be...
Excuse me, yeah...</i>

852
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,595
What is that police pat that you
give me on the back all the time?

853
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:31,700
Kenya!

854
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:50,152
This looks like
a bordello in Bangkok.

855
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,023
Hi.
Hi, sweetie.

856
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:54,495
<i>I didn't think you'd
make it. Dr. McQueen.</i>

857
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:55,622
Dad!

858
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:57,623
<i>Hello.
I'm Brian.</i>

859
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,327
Oh, the landscaper.

860
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:01,996
Actually, Brian is my friend, Mother.

861
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:07,073
Brian, good to meet you.
Good to meet you too, sir.

862
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:11,571
Oh, why did you cut your hair?
It was your shining glory.

863
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:13,548
It was a weave, Mother.

864
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,976
Well, it suited you.

865
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,885
Come on, take me in the house
so I can freshen up.

866
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:23,525
So, you did all this? Yeah,
let me show you around.

867
00:59:23,593 --> 00:59:25,584
Kenya, look at this place.

868
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:30,224
You have gone all bohemian, my dear.
What on earth has gotten into you?

869
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:32,831
Do not answer that.

870
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:38,406
<i>I'm gonna tell Mama.</i>

871
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:39,941
Hi, Nelson.
Hi.

872
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:45,240
Oh, my bad. Luna, this is my
sister Kenya. Kenya, this is Luna.

873
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:46,475
Hi.
Hi.

874
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:49,245
Listen to me.
I think I found the one.

875
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:53,148
<i>Well, that's great.
Congratulations.</i>

876
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:56,555
Oh, no, no, no. No, for you.
I found your future husband.

877
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:59,220
Yeah, my mentor in law school
just moved into town.

878
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:01,456
<i>Nelson, why don't you just
stay out of my business?</i>

879
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:04,591
Can you just do me a favor,
and just check him out first?

880
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:07,727
<i>I promise you, you are gonna
thank me. You're gonna thank me.</i>

881
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:10,830
And also I told him
to come here tonight.

882
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:13,000
What? Yeah, I called
him like, yesterday.

883
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:15,101
<i>Nelson,
I'm gonna strangle you.</i>

884
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:17,578
<i>You know what? It's too
late, 'cause he's here.</i>

885
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:23,710
This is for allowing me
to crash your party.

886
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,447
<i>I'm Mark Harper.</i>

887
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,014
<i>What's up, baby boy?
How are you, sir?</i>

888
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:30,787
Mark gave me
my first job as an intern.

889
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:35,796
Thanks. Nice to meet
you. Same here. Finally.

890
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:37,890
<i>Nelson's been telling me
about you for years now.</i>

891
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,525
<i>I've talked about you for years. Yeah.</i>

892
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:42,594
So, you just bought
this place? Yeah, yeah.

893
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:43,832
<i>It's nice.</i>

894
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:46,466
<i>I just relocated from Phoenix,
myself. I'm looking for a place.</i>

895
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:50,137
So, maybe you can help me
out. Show me some things.

896
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:55,748
<i>I mean, I'm thinking you're probably
an expert in the area by now.</i>

897
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:58,514
Oh, well,
I know a thing or two...

898
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:00,852
<i>but I wouldn't call myself
an authority or anything.</i>

899
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:02,515
Oh.
What?

900
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:05,186
Look, my sister is just playing
it down. She knows her stuff...

901
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:07,695
and she could give you the
numerical breakdown of anything.

902
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:10,062
<i>Well, that's perfect 'cause
that's just what I need.</i>

903
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:11,896
How about next week?

904
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,633
Can I let you know?

905
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:20,167
No. No, of course.
Of course, yeah.

906
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:24,076
<i>Hey, you know what? Why don't
we go check out the grill?</i>

907
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:27,116
<i>No, I'm good, man. I'm good right
here. I wanna show you the barbeque.</i>

908
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:29,174
It was nice meeting you.
Nice meeting you.

909
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:30,446
Hey, baby.
Hi.

910
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,249
How are you?
Good.

911
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:36,923
<i>Who's that guy?
Some friend of Nelson's.</i>

912
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:39,426
Nice plant.

913
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:44,893
Kenya!

914
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:46,993
Bye.
Bye.

915
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,265
See you later.
All right, guys.

916
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:52,132
<i>So, we met Nelson's mentor.</i>

917
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:55,502
Is that handsome or what?
And well-spoken.

918
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:57,273
He said that you were gonna
show him around.

919
01:01:57,346 --> 01:02:00,110
Say good night, Joyce.
We have to go.

920
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:03,118
Young man, you did an
interesting job on the garden.

921
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:04,585
Oh, thank you.
Yes, very good work.

922
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:06,554
It was great talking
to you, sir. Me, too.

923
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:08,613
Did you get your cotillion invite? Yes.

924
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:10,818
You must come.
Senator Abamaus Leeds is-

925
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,554
<i>We'll talk about it
later, Mother.</i>

926
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:13,925
Come on, come on.
Good night.

927
01:02:13,996 --> 01:02:15,623
Good night.
Good night.

928
01:02:18,434 --> 01:02:19,526
Bye.

929
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:22,328
<i>So, what's a cotillion?</i>

930
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:27,665
Seventeen years old.

931
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:30,372
The debutante being
presented to society.

932
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:32,141
<i>I can't believe
people still do that.</i>

933
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:33,546
They take it seriously,
too.

934
01:02:33,616 --> 01:02:35,345
<i>That's Mom and Dad.</i>

935
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:40,045
My escort, David Fontaine.

936
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:42,883
His father and mine
went to med school together.

937
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:44,859
My parents flew him out
from Atlanta.

938
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,394
<i>You couldn't find
someone locally?</i>

939
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:48,259
It was a big deal
to my mother.

940
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:51,266
<i>"Kenya Denise McQueen
escorted by David Fontaine...</i>

941
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:55,031
<i>"son of Dr. and
Mrs. David Fontaine. "</i>

942
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:56,795
Whatever.

943
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:02,136
My grandfather passed away
two years ago.

944
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:04,202
And my nana
still lives in Baltimore.

945
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,010
<i>Well, they look like they're
having fun. They lived for it.</i>

946
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:10,177
It was the black high-society
event of the year.

947
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:17,886
So, you wanna go?

948
01:03:18,027 --> 01:03:20,427
<i>It's on the same night as
the community garden party...</i>

949
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:22,589
but I can blow that off.

950
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:26,733
<i>I don't know.
I think I'll skip this year.</i>

951
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,703
Why? Because of me?

952
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:31,198
<i>I'm a great
ballroom dancer.</i>

953
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:37,241
<i>I don't know. I just... I just
don't think we'd be comfortable.</i>

954
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:39,580
We or you?

955
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:48,215
<i>Come on, let's go to bed.</i>

956
01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:50,854
We both have to
work tomorrow, remember?

957
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:52,155
Yeah, I do.

958
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:01,236
Kenya!
Hey, Edwin.

959
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:03,829
<i>Listen, I'm sorry about that
business with Jack Pino the other day.</i>

960
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:07,501
<i>I know he's being an ass. But, as you
said, we're here to serve the client...</i>

961
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:09,636
and sometimes that means
putting egos aside.

962
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:10,736
Absolutely.

963
01:04:10,813 --> 01:04:12,781
<i>We knew you could handle it.
You're a pro.</i>

964
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,476
Thanks.
Thank you.

965
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:21,718
Walter gave me the secret
to his famous grilled salmon.

966
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:23,315
Want to try it?

967
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:26,922
<i>Whatever's fine.</i>

968
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:31,155
You all right?

969
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:33,158
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

970
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:38,164
<i>The white boys at the plantation are
getting on my last nerve, that's all.</i>

971
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:40,599
Could we put the white boys
on hold for tonight?

972
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:44,009
The white folks. The brothers,
the sisters. All of them.

973
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:47,344
What are you saying?

974
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:52,013
<i>Just not tonight, babe. I, you
know... I had a rough day, too.</i>

975
01:04:52,488 --> 01:04:55,184
I need to get home
and relax.

976
01:04:57,426 --> 01:05:00,190
<i>You're asking me to not talk
about race? No, I didn't say that.</i>

977
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:02,993
You expect me to be in this relationship
with you and never bring it up?

978
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,625
What? We talk about it
all the time.

979
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:07,931
I just said, not right now.

980
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,612
When? When is appropriate?

981
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:22,511
<i>When we're at home behind closed
doors, when we're just joking about it?</i>

982
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:25,679
No, just not all the time. All right?
It just makes me feel uncomfortable.

983
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,620
<i>I'm sorry, but I wasn't
brought up that way.</i>

984
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:30,022
<i>First of all, you don't have
to talk about being white...</i>

985
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:32,925
<i>because no one reminds you
every day that you're white.</i>

986
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:34,656
<i>The only time you guys
know you're white...</i>

987
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:38,461
<i>is when you're in a room full of
black people. I'm in a room full of...</i>

988
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:45,131
<i>I'm in a world full of white people, and
every day they remind me that I'm black.</i>

989
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:47,300
<i>And if I can't talk to you
about my frustrations...</i>

990
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:50,345
<i>if I'm just supposed to keep that to myself
- Kenya, hold on.</i>

991
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:53,712
<i>You're a senior manager at one of the
whitest firms in the country. All right?</i>

992
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:57,275
<i>You graduated top of your class from
Stanford and Wharton, for Christ's sake.</i>

993
01:05:57,353 --> 01:05:59,412
You own a home. You earn
more money than what?

994
01:05:59,488 --> 01:06:02,685
black or white.
Certainly more than me.

995
01:06:02,758 --> 01:06:05,090
<i>So, you know, tell me about your
frustrations, 'cause I'm listening.</i>

996
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:07,322
<i>No, you don't want to hear it.
You don't want to hear about...</i>

997
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:09,091
how when I show up
at an account meeting...

998
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:11,599
<i>they always have to regroup
when they find out I'm the one...</i>

999
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:14,101
<i>who's responsible for their
multi-million-dollar acquisition.</i>

1000
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:15,831
<i>They'd rather trust it
to a file clerk.</i>

1001
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:19,238
<i>The guy who gets me my goddamn
coffee, because he's white.</i>

1002
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:20,866
Do you know
how insulting that is?

1003
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:23,275
<i>They're jerks. Forget
them, baby. They're jerks.</i>

1004
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:25,678
They have nothing to do with us.
They have nothing to do with us.

1005
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:28,979
<i>Brian, if I can't talk to you about
the black shit that drives me crazy...</i>

1006
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:30,814
or the white shit
that drives me crazy...

1007
01:06:30,886 --> 01:06:34,322
<i>if I'm just supposed to keep that
to myself. Brian! And deny who I am-</i>

1008
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:38,486
<i>No, I've never asked you to deny anything.
All I wanted, all I wanted was a night off.</i>

1009
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:42,395
<i>That's what being black is about,
Brian. You don't get a night off.</i>

1010
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:44,432
You know what?

1011
01:06:45,735 --> 01:06:49,000
<i>I'm never gonna be on the right side
of the war going on inside your head...</i>

1012
01:06:49,071 --> 01:06:51,699
<i>'cause I'm not black. All
right? I'm never gonna be black.</i>

1013
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:55,767
<i>So maybe this isn't what you want.
Maybe it just isn't gonna work.</i>

1014
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:57,403
<i>Maybe it's not.</i>

1015
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:22,732
<i>Hi. Hey, Kenya. Did I
catch you at a bad time?</i>

1016
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:26,268
I can really
see myself here.

1017
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:27,940
It is nice.

1018
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:32,940
But I think the asking price is
a little too high for the area.

1019
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:34,949
I would bid at about
80 grand less.

1020
01:07:35,017 --> 01:07:38,384
<i>And when the broker asks you what
you think, don't be too enthusiastic.</i>

1021
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:40,547
Wait till tomorrow
to make your offer.

1022
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:41,988
Okay.
Okay.

1023
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,526
So, how are you two doing?

1024
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:47,561
I like it.
Very good. And Mrs. Harper?

1025
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:51,122
<i>Oh, no. I'm
- Mrs. Harper has her questions.</i>

1026
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:53,462
<i>But we'll get back to you
tomorrow with our final answer.</i>

1027
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:56,403
Sounds good. You have
my card. Yeah. Thank you.

1028
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:57,962
Mrs. Harper.

1029
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:01,436
Take care.

1030
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:08,749
Enough about me.

1031
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:12,586
So, how are the good old boys
treating you down at the plantation?

1032
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:15,419
Oh, you know them.
Fond of testing us.

1033
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:17,982
Oh, yeah.
The old black tax.

1034
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:19,525
But we play the game.

1035
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:21,927
<i>We do what we gotta do
to get ahead. Don't we?</i>

1036
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:24,797
We sure do.

1037
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:31,295
So, how often do you
get home to St. Louis?

1038
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,666
Every once in a while.

1039
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:37,337
<i>Well, it seems like I'm tied to my desk
lately, though. I work most weekends.</i>

1040
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:40,473
<i>Haven't been able to go anywhere.
And they got me up for partner now.</i>

1041
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:42,312
I know all about that.

1042
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:44,318
You up for partner, too?
You?

1043
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:46,377
You got it going,
there, girl!

1044
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,423
Two partners. Watch out.

1045
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:49,716
Dang!

1046
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:56,694
<i>You know, I hope
this isn't too forward...</i>

1047
01:08:56,765 --> 01:09:00,326
but I would really like to
spend some real time with you.

1048
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:03,297
<i>But no, no, I've got to say, now,
I'm not one of these LA guys...</i>

1049
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:05,397
lots of women, the whole
fast lifestyle, all that.

1050
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:08,466
I like to keep it nice and
simple. One lady at a time.

1051
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:10,136
<i>I'm thinking
about the future right now.</i>

1052
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:16,540
<i>So what's going on with you, Kenya?
You got a man? You seeing somebody?</i>

1053
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,246
Now?

1054
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:22,856
No. Not really, no.

1055
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,259
<i>That's what I wanna hear.</i>

1056
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:30,459
<i>Yes, Mother. I'm picking
the dress up tomorrow.</i>

1057
01:09:31,901 --> 01:09:33,926
Okay. Yes.

1058
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:37,735
<i>Mother, I'll call you back.
Okay.</i>

1059
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:42,637
Max!

1060
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:54,114
You gonna let me in?

1061
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:03,227
<i>I haven't heard from you
in two weeks.</i>

1062
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:05,096
<i>Don't you think you
should have called first?</i>

1063
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:07,567
<i>Well, I thought
I'd just show up.</i>

1064
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:11,665
<i>You're right. I'm sorry.
I should have called first.</i>

1065
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:15,338
<i>The reason you haven't
heard from me is 'cause...</i>

1066
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:18,369
well, to be honest,
I felt stupid.

1067
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:20,745
I should have just
listened to you that day.

1068
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:23,717
All you needed was a shoulder,
not another critic.

1069
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:26,379
<i>I don't know where
my head was that day.</i>

1070
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:30,414
I had a guy walk off the job, and I
guess I was feeling a little frustrated.

1071
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:33,518
I wanna be there for you,
Kenya. I really do.

1072
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:36,631
And we can talk. We can
talk about whatever you like.

1073
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:40,897
<i>I may not always relate, but
I can promise I'll empathize.</i>

1074
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:43,166
Can you trust that?

1075
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:48,071
<i>'Cause it'd be a terrible shame to let
something so superficial get in our way.</i>

1076
01:10:48,143 --> 01:10:51,203
<i>Just give up because
it's challenging sometimes.</i>

1077
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,714
<i>I mean, aren't we both
up to the challenge?</i>

1078
01:10:57,152 --> 01:10:58,813
Kenya, I love you.

1079
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:04,282
<i>I don't know
what to say.</i>

1080
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:10,596
Should I give you a hint?

1081
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:13,499
Look, I met someone else.

1082
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:19,533
<i>It's not like I went out looking
or anything. It just happened.</i>

1083
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:23,734
<i>Let me guess.
He's black?</i>

1084
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:25,575
It is not only that.
We have more in common.

1085
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:27,673
A suit-and-tie guy?
Yeah.

1086
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,850
<i>Let's go, Max.
Come on, let's go.</i>

1087
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:35,650
<i>I didn't mean for this
to happen.</i>

1088
01:11:35,724 --> 01:11:38,659
<i>Don't worry. We were just...
We were just hanging out, right?</i>

1089
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:40,956
Right.

1090
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:43,865
<i>Look, I'll put the check for
the landscaping in the mail.</i>

1091
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:45,559
<i>No, don't. Don't.</i>

1092
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,300
Take care.

1093
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:57,808
You got to keep everything loose.
Got to keep your knees loose.

1094
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,404
Keep your hips loose.

1095
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:01,244
Keep everything loose.
Like that, all right?

1096
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,148
What does this have to
do with hitting the ball?

1097
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:05,550
This is how you gotta get the
motion. You gotta get the feel.

1098
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:07,680
<i>Know what I'm saying? Bounce
with me. Bounce with it.</i>

1099
01:12:07,756 --> 01:12:10,623
Look at that. Look at that.
There you go, girl.

1100
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:12,661
Keep your knees loose.
Three things.

1101
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:14,593
<i>There's the back swing.</i>

1102
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,358
<i>There's the contact.</i>

1103
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:18,059
<i>And then
there's the follow-through.</i>

1104
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:20,033
Now follow through,
let me see how you do that.

1105
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:21,228
Like that.

1106
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:24,533
Good. All right, you got it.

1107
01:12:26,975 --> 01:12:28,067
Okay.

1108
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:38,382
This is great, right?

1109
01:12:57,306 --> 01:12:59,672
<i>Thank you. You're doing
a great job, young man.</i>

1110
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:02,206
<i>We're supposed to do this.
Hey, little man.</i>

1111
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:04,212
<i>Thank you.
No, it's for you.</i>

1112
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:05,769
Oh, for me?
Yeah.

1113
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:08,646
<i>This is Leah's family synagogue,
right? Yeah, I guess so.</i>

1114
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,810
You need to
get a yarmulke.

1115
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:15,716
Kenya.

1116
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:17,685
Hello.

1117
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:19,861
This is Penelope, Kenya.

1118
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:22,895
<i>You're Penelope.
It's nice to meet you.</i>

1119
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:25,058
I love your dress.
Thanks.

1120
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:32,095
<i>Oh, I'm sorry. This is...
This is Mark.</i>

1121
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:35,234
Brian.
How are you doing?

1122
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:36,935
Hi.

1123
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:41,611
<i>So, you two got back
together. That's nice.</i>

1124
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:45,411
Yeah.

1125
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:51,952
<i>Well, it's good
to see you.</i>

1126
01:13:58,367 --> 01:14:00,130
Okay, maybe I should
call a doctor.

1127
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:01,726
<i>No, no. It's nothing.</i>

1128
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:05,262
<i>My asthma just comes back at the
oddest times. That's all. It'll pass.</i>

1129
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:07,331
Okay, what is this about?
Is this about Brian?

1130
01:14:07,409 --> 01:14:09,343
Brian? No, no, no.

1131
01:14:09,411 --> 01:14:12,574
But can you believe, he had the nerve
to show up with that white woman?

1132
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:15,048
Last time I checked,
Brian was white, too.

1133
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,984
And it is over, right? You
broke up with him, right?

1134
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:20,783
<i>Okay, you know what, guys? Maybe
we shouldn't talk about this here...</i>

1135
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:22,448
<i>'cause this is
a rabbi's study.</i>

1136
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:24,958
<i>I don't think it's too cool
for us to be in here.</i>

1137
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:28,687
<i>Look, girl, pull it together.
Don't let Mark see you like this.</i>

1138
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:32,561
How could he?

1139
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:35,831
It was so easy for him to just get
back with her like it was nothing.

1140
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:38,873
<i>Aren't you forgetting
something? You've got a man, too.</i>

1141
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:41,933
A fine, successful,
black man. Okay?

1142
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:44,478
<i>You're right. What am I
saying? Mark's wonderful.</i>

1143
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:45,706
Mark is fine.
Yes.

1144
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:47,544
<i>He's your IBM, right?
Right. Right.</i>

1145
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:52,444
<i>I mean, let's get real here, okay.</i>

1146
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:55,888
Brian is cute and all that,
but he is a white boy.

1147
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:58,620
Oh, come on, Kenya, please!

1148
01:14:58,727 --> 01:15:01,195
I mean, were you really gonna
go the distance?

1149
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:02,855
Honestly?
Be honest with yourself.

1150
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:05,900
You always get in your own
way. This is what you do.

1151
01:15:05,968 --> 01:15:08,095
<i>You've got a lot of nerve talking
about going the distance...</i>

1152
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,432
screwing married men!

1153
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:10,631
Okay, okay. Enough.

1154
01:15:10,706 --> 01:15:12,333
<i>What happened to "Let
go, let flow?" Good luck.</i>

1155
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:13,738
<i>Wait, wait, wait.
I'm sorry.</i>

1156
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:15,106
<i>It's fine.
It is true though, girl.</i>

1157
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,542
Go deal with them demons.

1158
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,879
<i>Look, it's not about
going the distance. Okay?</i>

1159
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:22,143
<i>'Cause you guys said that Walter
and I weren't gonna make it.</i>

1160
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:23,411
And we tighter than ever.

1161
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:26,613
<i>Kenya, I don't know what your
problem is, girl, but Mark is a catch.</i>

1162
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:29,589
<i>And if you don't know what to do
with him, girl, pass him on to me...</i>

1163
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:31,489
<i>'cause I will show you
what to do with him.</i>

1164
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:35,121
<i>I'll marry his ass quick and
give him a shitload of babies.</i>

1165
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:36,960
Black, ashy babies.

1166
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:44,197
Our Sunday dinners have been a tradition
since our first year of marriage.

1167
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:46,332
Right, Edmond?
Right, Joyce.

1168
01:15:46,408 --> 01:15:49,502
<i>It's the only day I'm
guaranteed a home-cooked meal.</i>

1169
01:15:49,578 --> 01:15:53,139
So, Mark, I understand your
father owns an insurance brokerage.

1170
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,705
<i>That's bedrock.</i>

1171
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:57,013
So your parents, how long
have they been married?

1172
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:59,315
Baby, you wanna ask him for
his social security number, too?

1173
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,219
<i>It's just a question.</i>

1174
01:16:01,523 --> 01:16:04,117
<i>Forty-five years.
They're my role models.</i>

1175
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:05,750
Oh, how sweet!

1176
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:08,895
Next year
we will celebrate our 35th.

1177
01:16:09,164 --> 01:16:11,132
Dr. McQueen is
the adventurer...

1178
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:13,963
and I am, how should I say...

1179
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:15,799
the voice of reason.

1180
01:16:16,638 --> 01:16:18,401
<i>It's a good balance.</i>

1181
01:16:18,473 --> 01:16:20,964
<i>He's always encouraging me
to try new things...</i>

1182
01:16:21,043 --> 01:16:24,103
<i>and of course, I'm always
saying, "No, thank you. "</i>

1183
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:32,611
<i>I had to show them who's
boss. You know what I mean?</i>

1184
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:34,155
Hell yes, I do.

1185
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:37,953
<i>So did Lauren happen to Lana? And
who's lined up to happen to Lauren?</i>

1186
01:16:38,026 --> 01:16:42,463
The last girl I was with, her name was
Luna. Yeah, and Lauren did happen to her.

1187
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:47,198
<i>And Lauren might actually be the
one. Check out her stats. She's fine.</i>

1188
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:49,499
She is an optician,
and she owns her own place.

1189
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:51,436
The odds are definitely
in her favor.

1190
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:52,905
Stats?
Stats.

1191
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:55,239
Is that how you decide to have
a relationship with someone?

1192
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:58,006
<i>I'm just trying to keep up
with you, big sis.</i>

1193
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:02,141
Mark is a great move.
You did good. You did.

1194
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:04,710
<i>Mrs. McQueen,
you'll like this story.</i>

1195
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:07,016
I convinced your daughter
to go out with me...

1196
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:09,751
by suggesting she
accompany me house-hunting.

1197
01:17:09,825 --> 01:17:12,453
<i>I told her I needed the
accountant's perspective, now.</i>

1198
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:15,860
What I did not tell her
was as a tax lawyer myself...

1199
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:17,894
I already knew the numbers.

1200
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:20,799
<i>Yeah. Yeah, that's me.
They call me the numbers man.</i>

1201
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:24,598
But can you blame me?
You gotta use what you got.

1202
01:17:24,673 --> 01:17:28,131
Mark, that is so cute.
Thank you.

1203
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:30,144
And if things
keep going well...

1204
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:33,477
<i>in six months from now, who
knows what we'll be celebrating.</i>

1205
01:17:33,548 --> 01:17:35,015
Right, Kenya?

1206
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,016
Oh, my God.

1207
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:39,177
Oh, Mark.

1208
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:42,849
Oh, my! Oh, my God!

1209
01:17:42,924 --> 01:17:46,485
<i>Let's just forget the coffee
and pop some champagne.</i>

1210
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:48,593
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1211
01:18:14,956 --> 01:18:16,355
You know...

1212
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:23,890
I love that picture of you, at
your folks, with the long hair.

1213
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:27,163
You know which one?

1214
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,605
You should let it grow.

1215
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:36,977
<i>I can't.
I can't do this.</i>

1216
01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:40,911
Kenya, Kenya, Kenya.
Am I going too fast?

1217
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:46,147
Kenya, wait, wait, wait.

1218
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:50,383
<i>Kenya. Hey, come on. I'll put
you in the guest room, all right?</i>

1219
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:54,361
<i>If you're not ready, it's all right.
It's all right. I understand. No pressure.</i>

1220
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:59,066
<i>In fact, I will... I will wait
for you as long as you want.</i>

1221
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:17,882
<i>Okay, I'll drive you home.
No, I'll drive myself.</i>

1222
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:20,617
<i>Why?
I can't do this.</i>

1223
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:24,621
<i>You're a great guy.</i>

1224
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:27,923
Perfect.

1225
01:19:29,965 --> 01:19:32,934
<i>But this just isn't
right for me.</i>

1226
01:19:34,703 --> 01:19:36,568
I hope you understand.

1227
01:19:38,907 --> 01:19:41,603
Wait, was it something I said?
Something I did?

1228
01:19:41,676 --> 01:19:44,736
<i>No, not at all. You've
been wonderful. It's me.</i>

1229
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:48,778
<i>I'm just looking
for something.</i>

1230
01:19:49,885 --> 01:19:52,479
<i>I don't know what it is,
really, but it's not here.</i>

1231
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:54,647
<i>Just like that.
I'm sorry.</i>

1232
01:20:03,064 --> 01:20:04,554
Shit. Shit.

1233
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:07,027
Shit.

1234
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:09,433
<i>I'm so stupid.</i>

1235
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:15,471
Maybe I just made the
biggest mistake of my life.

1236
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:18,778
He was fine and smart.

1237
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:23,115
But there was no fizzle.
No magic.

1238
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:26,612
<i>I don't know. Kenya, look,
don't beat yourself up.</i>

1239
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:28,846
You gotta listen to
your instincts.

1240
01:20:28,924 --> 01:20:30,915
Yeah, but what if my
instincts are screwed up?

1241
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:34,052
Your instincts are fine.
You did a brave thing.

1242
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:36,926
You let your heart do the
talking, not your parents...

1243
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:40,695
not society, not black
people, not your girls.

1244
01:20:41,036 --> 01:20:43,129
You decided for you,
honey.

1245
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:46,568
So, you gonna give
Brian a call?

1246
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:48,834
This is not about Brian.

1247
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:52,846
<i>I mean, it would be if he were black,
but he's not. That's just the reality.</i>

1248
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:55,815
Look, Kenya,
as a black man...

1249
01:20:56,585 --> 01:21:00,954
I must say, I was a little suspicious
of the guy, when I first met him.

1250
01:21:01,723 --> 01:21:05,022
<i>But at the end of the day it's
not about skin color or race.</i>

1251
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:07,391
<i>It's about
the love connection.</i>

1252
01:21:07,796 --> 01:21:10,594
<i>The vibe that's between
a man and a woman.</i>

1253
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:14,063
Does he make you feel loved,
he make you laugh...

1254
01:21:14,135 --> 01:21:17,832
he make you just wanna forget about
all the bullshit and just enjoy life?

1255
01:21:17,906 --> 01:21:20,898
<i>Because if that's what
you have with Brian...</i>

1256
01:21:21,576 --> 01:21:24,773
<i>Baby, I don't know when
you're gonna wake up to that.</i>

1257
01:21:29,684 --> 01:21:32,175
It is my recommendation
that the Pino Group...

1258
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:34,347
not acquire
Net Worth Consolidated.

1259
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:38,749
<i>You don't want this company,
Jack.</i>

1260
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:41,887
<i>I'm not gonna paint a pretty picture
by being creative with the numbers...</i>

1261
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:45,091
and I will not stand with the firm
in recommending you purchase it.

1262
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:47,864
<i>I'm sorry,
but that's my position.</i>

1263
01:21:49,604 --> 01:21:52,038
This is not
what I wanted to hear.

1264
01:21:53,808 --> 01:21:57,505
Kenya, do you think we could
have a moment alone with Jack?

1265
01:21:58,446 --> 01:21:59,538
Sure.

1266
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:22,130
Got the 10-K of SEC filings
for Kate Blanchard.

1267
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:27,940
<i>I've also got a bottle
of tequila in my desk.</i>

1268
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:29,636
<i>Darren, I'm fine.</i>

1269
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:38,476
Can I have a word with you? Sure.

1270
01:22:40,822 --> 01:22:44,189
That was quite a show
you put on back there, Kenya.

1271
01:22:45,593 --> 01:22:48,756
<i>And that's precisely
what we want at this firm.</i>

1272
01:22:49,431 --> 01:22:51,399
Guts, smarts, integrity.

1273
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:56,028
Without your good judgment, this
firm would have made a big mistake.

1274
01:22:56,338 --> 01:22:58,272
Outstanding work, Kenya.

1275
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:02,170
Thanks.

1276
01:23:03,545 --> 01:23:07,311
<i>Now, you know the vote's tonight, but
let me be the first to congratulate you...</i>

1277
01:23:07,682 --> 01:23:08,876
partner.

1278
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:11,077
<i>I've made partner?</i>

1279
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:12,779
<i>You've made partner.</i>

1280
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:18,022
<i>Oh, well, that's great!</i>

1281
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:21,261
I told you we had our eye
on you. Oh, my goodness!

1282
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:25,265
<i>Your input is invaluable to this
firm. We're very lucky to have you.</i>

1283
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:26,994
I appreciate that.

1284
01:23:27,068 --> 01:23:28,660
Congratulations.

1285
01:23:28,903 --> 01:23:30,063
Edwin.

1286
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:33,199
Actually, I have one request.

1287
01:23:33,274 --> 01:23:34,673
<i>What's that?</i>

1288
01:23:35,577 --> 01:23:38,444
One weekend a month
is untouchable.

1289
01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:43,778
No cell phone, no email.
Just my time.

1290
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:47,847
I think we can handle that.

1291
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:09,500
Ladies, are you ready to
keep up with me tonight?

1292
01:24:09,577 --> 01:24:12,102
<i>'Cause I'm gonna keep both of you
on the dance floor till you say...</i>

1293
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:13,875
<i>"Please, big Daddy,
I can't take no more. "</i>

1294
01:24:13,948 --> 01:24:17,247
<i>Oh, Edmond, really! Hey,
Kenya, isn't that Cheryl?</i>

1295
01:24:19,554 --> 01:24:20,646
Wow.

1296
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:24,984
<i>You look gorgeous. Cheryl!
I didn't even recognize you.</i>

1297
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,493
You look beautiful!

1298
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:29,894
You are positively glowing.
Thank you, Mrs. McQueen.

1299
01:24:29,964 --> 01:24:32,296
<i>You know, maybe
it's because of this.</i>

1300
01:24:36,438 --> 01:24:39,930
Oh, my God!
Details, details.

1301
01:24:40,008 --> 01:24:41,635
Well, it was
a total surprise.

1302
01:24:41,709 --> 01:24:45,577
<i>I'm dropping him off at the airport.
He gets down on one knee and bam!</i>

1303
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:49,143
I mean, I was expecting
something nice. But this?

1304
01:24:49,384 --> 01:24:51,818
And he picked it out all
by himself. My goodness!

1305
01:24:51,886 --> 01:24:54,184
<i>Nelson, I hope
you're taking notes.</i>

1306
01:24:54,289 --> 01:24:55,620
<i>You don't have to
worry about that.</i>

1307
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:57,885
<i>It's gorgeous.
Isn't it, Kenya?</i>

1308
01:24:57,959 --> 01:24:59,483
Yes it is, Mother.

1309
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:02,792
<i>We'll talk later. And remember
what I said the other night.</i>

1310
01:25:04,799 --> 01:25:05,891
You okay?

1311
01:25:06,334 --> 01:25:07,961
<i>I'm fine.
Okay.</i>

1312
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:11,161
<i>Introducing
Miss Deavon Frost.</i>

1313
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:14,037
<i>Parents are Dr. and
Mrs. Malcolm Frost.</i>

1314
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:18,705
<i>Escorted by Sidney Baldwin, son
of the Honorable Stanley Baldwin.</i>

1315
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:24,778
<i>Introducing Miss Rene Atkins.</i>

1316
01:25:24,853 --> 01:25:27,720
<i>Parents are Mr. and
Mrs. Ronald Atkins.</i>

1317
01:25:39,634 --> 01:25:42,865
<i>...Mr. and
Mrs. David Hunter III, Esq.</i>

1318
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:06,824
Slow down.

1319
01:26:19,407 --> 01:26:21,341
This is so silly.

1320
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:24,274
<i>I can't believe I ever
took this seriously.</i>

1321
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:35,251
I mean, really, what are we
trying to prove with this?

1322
01:26:35,323 --> 01:26:38,451
That our little princesses can grow
up and marry little princes, too?

1323
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:40,221
As long as they both have
the right pedigree...

1324
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:42,160
<i>they're guaranteed
to live happily ever after.</i>

1325
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:44,095
I mean,
how shallow is that?

1326
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:48,935
<i>Don't believe the hype, girls! It
ain't what it's cracked up to be.</i>

1327
01:26:49,003 --> 01:26:50,129
Kenya!

1328
01:26:50,538 --> 01:26:51,869
You stop that!

1329
01:27:13,094 --> 01:27:15,892
Go on, girls.
Better pretend while you can.

1330
01:27:15,964 --> 01:27:17,625
I have had enough!

1331
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,565
You have done nothing
but embarrass us all evening.

1332
01:27:20,635 --> 01:27:23,195
<i>Embarrass you. I'm
embarrassing you? Yes.</i>

1333
01:27:23,271 --> 01:27:25,535
Complaining and carrying on.

1334
01:27:25,873 --> 01:27:29,570
Blaming everyone but the one
responsible for your unhappiness.

1335
01:27:29,644 --> 01:27:32,613
<i>Yourself. Perhaps it's
time you faced that.</i>

1336
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:34,938
Thanks, Mother.

1337
01:27:35,883 --> 01:27:37,077
Kenya.

1338
01:27:39,387 --> 01:27:41,116
<i>I shouldn't have said that.</i>

1339
01:28:12,053 --> 01:28:13,418
Sweet pea.

1340
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:22,755
There comes a time in life when
we have to strike out on our own.

1341
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:24,730
<i>And we...
Whoa.</i>

1342
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:27,529
<i>Don't worry about me.
I'm a doctor.</i>

1343
01:28:28,836 --> 01:28:30,133
And a father.

1344
01:28:30,204 --> 01:28:31,933
<i>I've seen it all,
heard it all.</i>

1345
01:28:32,006 --> 01:28:33,803
Handle your business.

1346
01:28:37,545 --> 01:28:40,105
<i>Kenya, you don't have to tell
me you have a thing for Brian.</i>

1347
01:28:40,181 --> 01:28:41,978
It was all over your face
and in your voice.

1348
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:44,348
<i>Daddy, it's over.
Please, don't.</i>

1349
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:46,387
I know love when I see it.

1350
01:28:46,454 --> 01:28:49,651
<i>Plus, I talked to him.
He's a good guy.</i>

1351
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:53,089
If you have feelings for him, you
need to do something about that.

1352
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:54,423
<i>But, Daddy...</i>

1353
01:28:54,495 --> 01:28:57,760
<i>You know how your mother always
says that I'm the adventurer.</i>

1354
01:28:58,633 --> 01:29:02,592
<i>Well, did you know that when we
met I didn't have a pot to piss in?</i>

1355
01:29:03,204 --> 01:29:04,728
I never told you this...

1356
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:07,900
but your grandparents threatened
to disown her if she married me.

1357
01:29:07,975 --> 01:29:10,637
But she defied them
and we ran off together.

1358
01:29:11,312 --> 01:29:14,645
<i>We didn't know how we were
gonna make it. But we did.</i>

1359
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:17,742
And her folks eventually
came around.

1360
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:21,516
The point is,
love is an adventure, Kenya.

1361
01:29:22,323 --> 01:29:25,121
<i>It's not a decision
you make for others.</i>

1362
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:28,188
<i>It's a decision
you make from the heart.</i>

1363
01:29:29,664 --> 01:29:33,191
<i>Anyway, the boy is just white.
He ain't a Martian.</i>

1364
01:29:35,236 --> 01:29:38,262
<i>I mean, folks carry on like
we're some kind of pure race...</i>

1365
01:29:38,339 --> 01:29:39,897
<i>that shouldn't
be diluted, huh?</i>

1366
01:29:39,974 --> 01:29:42,340
But look at us,
all of us in this country.

1367
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:45,709
<i>Black, white, brown, yellow.
We're all mixed up.</i>

1368
01:29:46,247 --> 01:29:49,011
Mutts. All of us.
Nothing pure about us.

1369
01:29:54,722 --> 01:29:57,054
I wish I had a father
like that.

1370
01:29:57,425 --> 01:30:01,122
<i>Sorry, I don't lend him out.
Not even on special occasions.</i>

1371
01:30:09,470 --> 01:30:11,802
<i>Hello, valet, can you
get me a cab? Yes, ma'am.</i>

1372
01:30:11,873 --> 01:30:14,433
Hey, where you going?
To get Brian back.

1373
01:30:14,509 --> 01:30:17,034
<i>What?
That's right, Brian.</i>

1374
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:20,270
<i>'Cause you know what?
I happen to love him.</i>

1375
01:30:22,984 --> 01:30:24,975
<i>Don't make love wait.
Take my car.</i>

1376
01:30:25,052 --> 01:30:27,520
Take my whip.
Take it, take it, take it.

1377
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:32,419
Just be easy on the 22s.
Be easy on the 22s.

1378
01:30:34,929 --> 01:30:36,419
Come on, now!

1379
01:30:43,137 --> 01:30:44,627
Oh, no!

1380
01:30:59,754 --> 01:31:02,279
Hi.
Hi.

1381
01:31:02,356 --> 01:31:03,948
By any chance,
have you seen Brian?

1382
01:31:04,025 --> 01:31:06,619
<i>Brian, I think
he's gone, honey.</i>

1383
01:31:07,695 --> 01:31:09,026
Thank you.

1384
01:31:47,068 --> 01:31:48,695
Max, I missed you.

1385
01:31:48,769 --> 01:31:50,134
Hi, Maxie.

1386
01:31:50,638 --> 01:31:51,832
Hi.

1387
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:04,443
Hi.

1388
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:06,678
Hey.

1389
01:32:08,289 --> 01:32:12,953
<i>Look, I know you must
think I'm combative...</i>

1390
01:32:13,694 --> 01:32:17,824
<i>neurotic, picky...
And maybe I am.</i>

1391
01:32:18,933 --> 01:32:20,958
But the weird thing is...

1392
01:32:21,102 --> 01:32:23,662
<i>I've never had to be
anyone but myself with you...</i>

1393
01:32:23,738 --> 01:32:25,467
right from the beginning.

1394
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:28,976
And with you I feel like
I can do anything...

1395
01:32:29,477 --> 01:32:32,776
say anything, try anything.

1396
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:38,150
<i>And that's the life I want.</i>

1397
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:42,986
I want an adventure with you.

1398
01:32:46,294 --> 01:32:48,660
<i>You don't understand.
We're supposed to be together.</i>

1399
01:32:48,729 --> 01:32:51,493
<i>I'm never gonna be
your dream man, Kenya.</i>

1400
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:53,591
<i>I just...
I won't be the fall-back guy.</i>

1401
01:32:53,668 --> 01:32:55,067
<i>No. See, that's the thing.</i>

1402
01:32:55,136 --> 01:32:58,503
<i>I don't have to wonder about that
anymore. I know this is right.</i>

1403
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:00,907
Dreams change.

1404
01:33:01,943 --> 01:33:05,344
Hey, when I was younger, my
dream was to marry Rick James.

1405
01:33:06,881 --> 01:33:09,111
<i>You're the one I want, Brian.</i>

1406
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,917
I love you.

1407
01:33:15,189 --> 01:33:16,850
I love you, Kenya.

1408
01:33:17,191 --> 01:33:19,421
<i>I've never stopped
loving you.</i>

1409
01:33:23,531 --> 01:33:26,762
<i>Oh, wait, wait. We have to go right
now. There's not much time left.</i>

1410
01:33:26,834 --> 01:33:28,734
Where?
What are we doing?

1411
01:33:31,205 --> 01:33:33,435
Do you know that guy
with the guitar?

1412
01:35:02,396 --> 01:35:05,263
Aw, shucks!

1413
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:07,697
Look at him!
Oh, my God.

1414
01:35:22,116 --> 01:35:23,947
Photo-op, photo-op, photo-op!

1415
01:35:24,018 --> 01:35:26,179
Everybody look at
the photographer!

1416
01:35:47,675 --> 01:35:49,404
I found her, Daddy!
