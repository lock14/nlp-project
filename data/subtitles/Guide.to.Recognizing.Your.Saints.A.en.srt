1
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,367
U h.

2
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:11,370
Dito.

3
00:01:12,207 --> 00:01:13,606
U h.

4
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:16,440
Oh, my goodness.

5
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:20,470
I can't believe to hear your voice on this machine.

6
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:22,740
It's your mother.

7
00:01:25,153 --> 00:01:28,316
Dito, I called your friend Nerf to call you.

8
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,790
He's a good kid. U h...

9
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:34,560
I don't know what else to do.

10
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:36,756
Your father's sick. He's real sick,

11
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:39,299
and he wont' go to the hospital. You know how he is,

12
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:43,269
and I'm sorry. I don't know what else to do.

13
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:47,332
Your friend Nerf, uh,

14
00:01:48,076 --> 00:01:52,479
he's a good kid, you know. He said he'd pick you up at the airport if you came.

15
00:01:53,248 --> 00:01:55,512
I know that it's far.

16
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:58,180
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:02,347
I, uh...

18
00:02:02,424 --> 00:02:04,984
I'm gonna hang up now, Dito.

19
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,391
Okay. I love you.

20
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:09,692
No matter what you do, I love you.

21
00:02:35,123 --> 00:02:40,891
Tonight we have the author of a wonderful, wonderful book.

22
00:02:40,962 --> 00:02:44,989
A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints. Dito Montiel.

23
00:02:48,703 --> 00:02:50,000
Thanks.

24
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:23,600
By the end of all this, Giuseppe,

25
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:26,333
his brother Antonio used to call him "Little Sister"

26
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:29,807
'cause he slept with Noxzema on his face every night.

27
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:33,314
It never even made sense, being everything else about him was a mess.

28
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:36,350
Well, he loved the face cream, you know?

29
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:39,615
Anyway, Giuseppe, he's gonna be dead.

30
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,518
Yeah, I know. It sucks.

31
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:44,490
There'll be another guy you'll meet too, same with him.

32
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:46,959
And then another little boy.

33
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:50,259
He's gonna die, too. What a mess, huh?

34
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:55,633
And I don't even know why I feel I gotta tell you this up front but I do.

35
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:58,035
And don't worry, like,

36
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:03,807
I'm not giving away any big ending, you know, with this.

37
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:06,506
A whole lot of other shit's gotta happen first.

38
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:12,782
But I just, uh, I wanna remember

39
00:04:15,023 --> 00:04:17,583
who these people are and what they meant to me.

40
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:20,925
What they mean to me.

41
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:23,486
And they are real.

42
00:04:49,424 --> 00:04:51,016
My name's Dito.

43
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:57,154
I'm gonna leave everybody in this film.

44
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,306
(Dito) I see Laurie's and Diane's walkin' down 31 st Street.

45
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:11,311
Hot pink leg warmers.

46
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:14,041
Red, white and blue roach clip feathered earrings.

47
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:17,380
"The Song Remains the Same" painted on the back of their jackets.

48
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:19,977
And they wanna know, "Yo, Dito, you Rock or Disco?"

49
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:21,146
[Crash]

50
00:05:21,222 --> 00:05:24,953
(Laurie) What the fuck? You fuckin' idiot I

51
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:28,427
(Dito) I see innocent Giuseppe's walking down the streets

52
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:31,021
where Puerto Ricans still listen to Journey.

53
00:05:32,901 --> 00:05:34,493
Dito, what's up, man?

54
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:37,231
Really, It's true. Puerto Ricans listen to Journey.

55
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:40,271
Yo, Steve Perry's the shit, bro!

56
00:05:40,975 --> 00:05:42,169
(Giuseppe) Antoniol

57
00:05:42,243 --> 00:05:44,768
When this place isn't covered in violence,

58
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:48,282
(Antonio) That's where the fuckin' shit from the toilet goes.

59
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:49,839
And even sometimes when it is,

60
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:52,682
You're drinking it like an idiot.

61
00:05:52,754 --> 00:05:54,517
You taking a bath and shit, man.

62
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:55,954
This place is heaven.

63
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:57,457
Get the fuck off him!

64
00:05:57,525 --> 00:06:00,289
Whoa, whoa.

65
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:02,022
Stop, stop, stop!

66
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:04,462
What's wrong with you? What the fuck?

67
00:06:06,668 --> 00:06:08,761
(Dito) What the fuck is that?

68
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:11,828
Motherfucker sounds like he's prayin' and shit.

69
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:14,272
Yes. Praying and shit, huh?

70
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:18,502
[Guys laugh]

71
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:21,815
Oh, ladies.

72
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:26,320
U h, which one of you wanna suck, suck me off first?

73
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:28,116
You? You?

74
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:29,952
You ain't got shit!

75
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,352
What about that?

76
00:06:37,298 --> 00:06:40,028
It's cute. I like it.

77
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:42,467
You got it.

78
00:06:44,973 --> 00:06:47,100
Hey, clean this shit up, too.

79
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:52,574
Hey yo, check it out. I wrote "Bruce Lee" up there.

80
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:55,115
(Antonio) Nerf, you climbed all the way up there?

81
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:58,681
What are you, a fuckin' stupid, man?

82
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:00,550
What the fuck is the matter with you?

83
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:06,818
Yo, that's fucked up. Somebody wrote some shit on your house, man.

84
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:08,822
(Nerf) Reaper, he's from Queensbridge.

85
00:07:09,097 --> 00:07:11,088
They wrote Satan and shit all over the church, too.

86
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:14,924
Hey, Dito.

87
00:07:15,003 --> 00:07:17,335
It's so hot outside. You got out, yet?

88
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:21,000
Tell him it's hot because it's summer, you know.

89
00:07:21,075 --> 00:07:25,205
Antonio, come in. Look at you guys. You're filthy.

90
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,508
(Dito) You want juice?

91
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:28,947
Yeah, give me a juice. Hey, look who's here.

92
00:07:29,017 --> 00:07:30,609
Antonio, what's going on?

93
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:35,247
Are you fixin'- - What are you doing?

94
00:07:35,323 --> 00:07:38,349
Could you keep it down down there?

95
00:07:38,426 --> 00:07:39,825
Hello! Oould you please...

96
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:41,794
Do you want me to say somethin' to 'em?

97
00:07:41,863 --> 00:07:44,058
No, it's okay. No. It's alright.

98
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:45,827
Oome on in.

99
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,927
Giuseppe, sit down. Good to see you. Antonio, where you been lately?

100
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:51,801
What do you mean? I've been around.

101
00:07:51,873 --> 00:07:54,103
I haven't seen you at the handball courts.

102
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:56,405
You guys getting tired of getting beat, huh?

103
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:59,674
Dito didn't tell you we been at the Boys club, boxing?

104
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:01,647
They got the Golden Gloves coming up.

105
00:08:01,716 --> 00:08:03,650
The only thing you'll ever box is oranges.

106
00:08:03,718 --> 00:08:06,551
Dad, this is serious. They got bags and everything.

107
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:07,918
It's cheap. $1 O.

108
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:10,549
$1 O. Where you guys gonna get $1 O from?

109
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,217
It's just $1 O.

110
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:14,921
You guys wanna be Golden Gloves? You learn from the best.

111
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:18,329
U p from the waist, down from the chin. That's Golden Gloves.

112
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,424
Okay. Stop it already. Seriously.

113
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,628
You're serious? Oome here.

114
00:08:22,704 --> 00:08:23,762
Shake my hand.

115
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:25,430
I'm glad to meet you. Serious.

116
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:29,442
That's a funny joke if I was five years old. Stop it.

117
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,239
The joke is five years old.

118
00:08:31,312 --> 00:08:32,802
Antonio, how old is this guy?

119
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,144
He's serious. I don't know how old he is.

120
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:37,844
What happened to your nose? It's bleeding.

121
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,251
It's my father. He's stupid. Whatever.

122
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:42,448
Don't say that about your father.

123
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:46,015
Hand him a dish rag. Wipe his nose there. What's the matter with him?

124
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:48,628
Are you alright? Are you getting a job?

125
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,425
What are you doing with your life?

126
00:08:50,498 --> 00:08:52,466
Yeah, for sure. I'm doing...

127
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,592
Yeah, you're not doing anything.

128
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:57,900
You wanna be boxers. Forget about these Golden Gloves.

129
00:08:57,972 --> 00:09:00,600
You wanna learn? You come to me, 'cause I'm the king.

130
00:09:00,675 --> 00:09:03,109
And the king sits right here.

131
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:06,044
Monty's throne, right? Monty's throne.

132
00:09:06,114 --> 00:09:08,378
I'm the king.

133
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:10,440
I'm gonna get up. I'm gonna show you...

134
00:09:10,518 --> 00:09:11,883
Are gonna get up? What?

135
00:09:11,953 --> 00:09:14,615
I'm gonna show him. I'm going to show you the left hook.

136
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:16,213
I'm gonna show you that left hook.

137
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,384
Bye, Mom. Antonio, come on. Antonio!

138
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,859
Alright, man. Oome on.

139
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,828
Antonio, come on I

140
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:25,889
Where you going? What's the matter with him?

141
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:28,333
What's the matter? Where you going?

142
00:09:28,403 --> 00:09:31,372
He wants to go. Giuseppe, come on, man.

143
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:32,633
Say good bye.

144
00:09:32,707 --> 00:09:35,232
Thank you very much. I appreciate it very much.

145
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,277
It was a pleasure talking to you.

146
00:09:37,345 --> 00:09:38,607
Thank you very much.

147
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,773
That kid doesn't say two words. It scares me that kid.

148
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:44,647
Antonio? Tonight I want you to come back.

149
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:47,950
I want you to have dinner with Dito and the family, alright?

150
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:49,853
You take care of that nose kid.

151
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:51,221
Absolutely.

152
00:09:52,727 --> 00:09:54,092
Yeah.

153
00:09:54,996 --> 00:09:56,020
They're alright.

154
00:09:56,097 --> 00:09:57,359
[Door closes]

155
00:09:57,432 --> 00:09:58,831
They're alright.

156
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:03,294
Good dancing.

157
00:10:03,371 --> 00:10:04,702
Look who we got here.

158
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:07,104
Oh, shit! Friggin' pistachio dick.

159
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:08,267
Look at these girls.

160
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:10,003
It curves like a banana, right?

161
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:12,375
No, like a pistachio.

162
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:14,347
Do you want some? You.

163
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:30,993
It's as hot as a fuckin' oven in here.

164
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:33,295
[Both murmur]

165
00:10:38,206 --> 00:10:42,540
Get the fuck off me! It's like 25O degrees. Get off me.

166
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,704
I feel like a piece of roast beef.

167
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,374
But look at me. I'm fuckin' sticky. Look at me.

168
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:50,110
So?

169
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:54,780
Fuckin' landlord's got the fuckin' radiators on in the summer.

170
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:59,524
You better not fuckin' cum in me.

171
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:04,789
No!

172
00:11:04,866 --> 00:11:06,857
Don't fuck.

173
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:10,631
You better not fuckin' cum in me.

174
00:11:12,874 --> 00:11:14,000
[Laughs]

175
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:17,806
[Screams in pain] Fuck!

176
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:19,005
What the fuck?

177
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,139

Fuck me.

179
00:11:22,884 --> 00:11:23,942
Oome here.

180
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:27,283
You want me to come over there and give you a hug or some shit?

181
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:29,050
I don't want you to fuckin' hug me.

182
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:33,025
Look what we got here. You guys are two naughty fuckers.

183
00:11:33,094 --> 00:11:34,322
Who the fuck is this guy?

184
00:11:34,395 --> 00:11:35,794
My little retarded sister.

185
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:38,388
You're the bitch who works at the pool with Diane.

186
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:40,798
I just got done fuckin' her.

187
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:42,335
Get the fuck out of here.

188
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:46,533
I'm virile and I'm virile and I'm virile, and I'm ready to do that shit.

189
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:48,802
I just stole this dildo from M rs. Duran's,

190
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:52,243
and I was wondering you go into that shit, baby? Two on one action?

191
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:54,110
All I'm saying, if I was an ugly bitch

192
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:57,708
and two hot studs like this wanted to fuck me, I'd be into it.

193
00:11:57,785 --> 00:12:00,549
I'm taking a shit and I'm out.

194
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:28,846
What are you thinking about?

195
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,747
I don't know.

196
00:12:35,323 --> 00:12:37,154
You're really beautiful, you know.

197
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:39,215
Thank you.

198
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:48,298
Are you pushing?

199
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:54,506
Do you wanna kiss me?

200
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:59,039
Do you wanna kiss me?

201
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:01,843
For sure. Kiss you.

202
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,081
Fuck you.

203
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:08,087
I'm sorry. I just, just wanna fuck you, you know.

204
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:09,520
Alright.

205
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:13,589
Alright?

206
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:16,494
No. You're bugging, man.

207
00:13:16,564 --> 00:13:20,830
I don't know why I said that. I wanna fuck you, you know.

208
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,732
I wanna fuck you, too.

209
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:25,995
I do. I really do.

210
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:27,097
For real?

211
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:28,573
For real.

212
00:13:30,645 --> 00:13:33,443
Class, this is Michael O'Shea. He's a new student.

213
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:36,483
He just moved here this winter from I reland.

214
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,452
And besides making music, M ichael wants to be a writer just like his father.

215
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:44,355
On his first day here, he wants to read a poem about America.

216
00:13:44,425 --> 00:13:46,655
Here you go.

217
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:52,361
[Scottish accent] My name's M ichael O'Shea, and I'm from Scotland.

218
00:13:54,368 --> 00:13:58,702
U h. My father says poems don't always have to rhyme.

219
00:13:58,773 --> 00:13:59,831
This one doesn't.

220
00:14:02,677 --> 00:14:08,115
My New friend. I know he likes me, but I think he needs me.

221
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:13,245
I definitely need him, too. This is a scary place sometimes.

222
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,844
But my new friend, he needs me

223
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:19,086
because together we're not like everybody else.

224
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,355
That was very nice, Michael. Thank you.

225
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:24,193
Okay, class, let's turn to page 64, please. Thank you.

226
00:14:27,268 --> 00:14:29,168
It's hot as shit out here.

227
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:31,804
What the fuck you looking at?

228
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:34,807
Don't even fuckin' try that shit.

229
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,308
Want some gum?

230
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:41,247
(Antonio) Yo, did you really take a shit in there?

231
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:42,748
What is wrong with you?

232
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:45,149
You smell like open ass, man.

233
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:48,552
[Retches]

234
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:51,147
Hey I Hey, old bitch.

235
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:53,989
Hey, hey. Hey, put your ass here.

236
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,558
Go ahead.

237
00:14:57,631 --> 00:15:01,431
N ice dress. Fuckin' looking like a cheetah.

238
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:04,369
(drunken man) Clean that shit upl

239
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:07,032
What? Fucker!

240
00:15:07,108 --> 00:15:08,905
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

241
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:11,274
Olean your shit up and tell him to fuck off!

242
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:14,576
Police'll be here in five minutes.

243
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:17,048
Antonio, come on.

244
00:15:17,118 --> 00:15:18,449
No, no, no, no.

245
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:19,417
Wait, wait.

246
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:22,979
Open the door, man. Hey, come on, open the fuckin' door!

247
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:25,617
Yo, meet me at the park, alright?

248
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:27,684
Meet me at the park.

249
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:30,128
You fucker. You better fuckin' flinch.

250
00:15:50,818 --> 00:15:53,548
You're the new kid from my class, right? From I reland.

251
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:55,384
Scotland.

252
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:58,948
We came and lived in Manhattan for a bit but now, yeah.

253
00:16:01,996 --> 00:16:03,861
Fucking crazy there, right?

254
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:07,225
I'm Dito.

255
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:09,292
I'm, uh, I'm Dito.

256
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,531
Mick. U hm, Mike.

257
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:14,267
M ick. U hm, M ike.

258
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:20,137
And then Giuseppe was the kid climbing on the window. The church, the roof.

259
00:16:20,948 --> 00:16:26,011
My friend, he was running naked on the... you remember that? On the roof?

260
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:27,144
He was funny.

261
00:16:28,823 --> 00:16:30,017
Where you going?

262
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:33,592
J ust got bored, you know?

263
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:35,595
Kind of ride the subway around.

264
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:37,824
Back and forth, and back and forth.

265
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:40,492
And back and forth. Back and forth.

266
00:16:41,035 --> 00:16:42,093
Stupid thing.

267
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,329
J ust back and forth?

268
00:16:43,404 --> 00:16:44,769
Yeah.

269
00:16:46,207 --> 00:16:48,732
I was gonna ride it to Coney Island or something.

270
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:52,301
Go there and I don't know, ride back.

271
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:55,837
I was thinking about going to Ooney Island, you know.

272
00:16:56,717 --> 00:16:58,912
(Dito) Yeah, 'cause I've never been.

273
00:16:59,987 --> 00:17:01,386
You've never been?

274
00:17:02,223 --> 00:17:05,920
No. I went to the zoo once but that was like in the Bronx or something.

275
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:06,982
It's not really...

276
00:17:07,061 --> 00:17:09,086
That's not traveling.

277
00:17:09,163 --> 00:17:11,461
It sucks, too. There's nothing really there.

278
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:15,896
What are you looking at?

279
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,301
That dot.

280
00:17:19,273 --> 00:17:21,901
Close one eye like this.

281
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,741
Fly right over it.

282
00:17:31,352 --> 00:17:32,842
Oh, shit. I got it.

283
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,425
(Monty) You want China?

284
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:47,296
That's what they got Chinatown for.

285
00:17:47,368 --> 00:17:51,805
You want Italy? You go to Georgie. Where's the Italians they go?

286
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:53,237
M ulberry Street.

287
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:54,331
Little Italy.

288
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:58,344
Wanna go to Puerto Rico? Go uptown. There's Puerto Ricans everywhere.

289
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:00,539
You know what Antonio just told me?

290
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:03,378
That there's wild dogs in Italy, right? Who needs that?

291
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,508
Not me.

292
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:06,382
I don't wanna be there.

293
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,353
[All talk at the same time]

294
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:09,889
How are you? N ice seeing you.

295
00:18:09,957 --> 00:18:11,686
U ncle George, how you doing?

296
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,021
I'm just boiling.

297
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:16,153
(Monty) It's summertime. That's why you're boiling.

298
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,164
You want some juice?

299
00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:19,597
Where you been?

300
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,567
I was in Coney Island.

301
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:23,398
(Monty) What were you doing there?

302
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,166
I was on the train. I meet up with this guy from school.

303
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,767
This Mike kid. He's from I reland. Like from the country I reland.

304
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:33,711
He was telling me about how he wants to do some music, like a band or something.

305
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:35,681
You just went to Ooney Island.

306
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:38,217
Is it just me or it's 1 OO degrees in this house?

307
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:42,051
It's summer. That's why it's hot. Right, Antonio?

308
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:43,851
Yeah. It's summer.

309
00:18:43,924 --> 00:18:45,482
It's, summer, baby. It's hot.

310
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:46,856
What can I tell you?

311
00:18:46,927 --> 00:18:52,593
Will you just stop teasing? The heat's unbearable. We gotta get a fan, Monty.

312
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,031
We gotta get a fan.

313
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:56,331
(George) Maria, you still there?

314
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:58,268
(Maria) I have to attach this machine.

315
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:01,604
(Monty) She's gonna set this place on firel

316
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:03,267
Can I see what's going on?

317
00:19:03,344 --> 00:19:06,472
I brought the tape. I brought the machine to show you, Monty.

318
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:08,174
I don't care about that machine.

319
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:10,375
You can play things from the television.

320
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:11,679
So it's that machine.

321
00:19:11,752 --> 00:19:14,152
(George) Rewind that. Let's see that again.

322
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:17,816
Dito, where you going? It's show time over here. [Telephone rings]

323
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:22,123
Are you expecting a date with that girl? That swimmer?

324
00:19:22,196 --> 00:19:26,462
We heard from your friend you have a girlfriend now, huh? She's a swimmer?

325
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:29,661
A Swimmer? Who, Laurie? She sells food at the pool.

326
00:19:29,737 --> 00:19:31,796
Yeah, she sells food at the pool.

327
00:19:31,872 --> 00:19:34,306
(Monty) That swimmer girl? Right, Antonio?

328
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,036
(Antonio) The swimmer girl.

329
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:39,307
U ncle George, she's not a swimmer. She sells food at the pool.

330
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,472
That's what she does.

331
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:43,573
What does she do? Like races or marathons?

332
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,380
Maybe it was the guy from Ooney Island. The I rish guy.

333
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:49,081
The guy who wants the band. Right, Monty?

334
00:19:49,156 --> 00:19:50,487
(Monty) She's a swimmer.

335
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:52,991
What's she doing at the pool if she don't swim?

336
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:59,966
[Answering machine] You have seven new messages.

337
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:02,798
U h, Dito, this is Nerf.

338
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,461
Your old friend Nerf.

339
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:09,538
Monty's not, not doing too good, man.

340
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:12,943
I know Antonio called you and, uh,

341
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:16,979
you... you're father's real sick, man.

342
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:19,980
Your mom called me

343
00:20:20,054 --> 00:20:25,151
and... she really wants you to come home, you know.

344
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,522
So you should.

345
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,458
(fruit man) Hey, come back.

346
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:30,588
Fuck you!

347
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:32,188
I hate those fucks!

348
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:33,255
What are you doing?

349
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,426
Pay, thank.

350
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:36,560
Oh, my God.

351
00:20:36,637 --> 00:20:39,936
Ohinese motherfucker always staring me down!

352
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:42,475
(fruit man) You pay.

353
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:44,534
Why does your dad calls us swimmers?

354
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:46,101
'Cause you work at a pool.

355
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,772
But I'm not a swimmer.

356
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:53,748
You better tell Antonio and his fucking brother not to come around my house.

357
00:20:53,821 --> 00:20:55,482
I don't like that asshole.

358
00:20:55,556 --> 00:20:57,046
Diane, don't worry about it.

359
00:20:57,124 --> 00:21:00,685
He's a controlling little fuck! I could tell just by looking at him.

360
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,353
You're making it bigger.

361
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,125
Stop being crazy, alright?

362
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:07,997
Is it just me or does that nigger seem retarded?

363
00:21:08,068 --> 00:21:11,560
What the fuck are you doing? That's my friend's mother's store.

364
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:13,731
That's the shit they wrote on your housel

365
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:15,399
What the fuck are you doing?

366
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:16,465
You got a problem?

367
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:18,443
Get off him right now. I'm not playing.

368
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:22,013
What the fuck? Are you crazy? Fucking bitch I

369
00:21:22,082 --> 00:21:24,073
That's right, asshole.

370
00:21:24,151 --> 00:21:26,415
I don't have a problem. Laurie, go get Antonio.

371
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:28,921
You need a bitch to go get your man?

372
00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:31,856
I should fuckin' kill you! I should fuckin' kill you.

373
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:35,986
I'm gonna get you. I got you, baby. You stupid fuckin' bitch!

374
00:21:36,063 --> 00:21:37,860
You nappy motherfucker.

375
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:39,262
I got you!

376
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:43,359
(Monty) Explain this to me.

377
00:21:43,437 --> 00:21:45,598
You and this swimmer got into some trouble?

378
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:48,004
M r. Montiel, I don't even swim.

379
00:21:48,075 --> 00:21:50,168
You don't swim. Look at that eye.

380
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:53,475
We collect tickets where the food is at the swimming pool.

381
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:56,744
I'm thinking of quitting. Maybe working at the supermarket.

382
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:59,251
It's just like too many kids.

383
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,616
Yeah, we care.

384
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:02,450
Fuck you, okay?

385
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:05,856
Put this on your eye, alright?

386
00:22:05,926 --> 00:22:08,087
I'm not putting meat on my eye.

387
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:11,222
Get out of here. I'm not putting that on my face.

388
00:22:11,298 --> 00:22:13,289
People used to do that 1 OO years ago.

389
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:17,030
I just want to know what's going on. Tell me what happened.

390
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:19,402
Nothing's going on. It's very simple.

391
00:22:19,473 --> 00:22:21,873
What happened to your eye?

392
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:24,035
I'm telling you, nothing happened, okay?

393
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:26,773
Some jerk was acting like a wise guy.

394
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:30,510
Daddy, some jerk was acting like a wise guy. That's it.

395
00:22:30,584 --> 00:22:31,915
That's it, okay?

396
00:22:31,985 --> 00:22:33,816
(Antonio) You got cut a little bit.

397
00:22:33,887 --> 00:22:35,752
He grabbed him by the face and cut him.

398
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:39,451
Who grabbed him by the face? A Puerto Rican?

399
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:42,324
The one that spray painted all the graffiti outside.

400
00:22:42,396 --> 00:22:44,990
A Puerto Rican did this? Was it the Reaper guy?

401
00:22:45,065 --> 00:22:46,089
Please, stop it.

402
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:49,897
Don't ask me to stop it. This guy better worry now. And I know where he is.

403
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,495
Nerf told me where they stay down by Queensbridge.

404
00:22:52,573 --> 00:22:57,101
Remember what I said. Two shots. Six inches, they go right down.

405
00:22:57,177 --> 00:22:58,974
Two shots? Shit.

406
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:02,106
Shut the fuck up. I'm sorry, Monty. I don't mean to be cursing.

407
00:23:02,182 --> 00:23:04,980
That's enough, okay? Hey!

408
00:23:08,021 --> 00:23:11,081
God gave me this mouth so I can use it and that's what I'm doing.

409
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:12,853
Am I gonna have to smack this girl?

410
00:23:12,926 --> 00:23:14,621
She's just talking.

411
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:17,621
Get the fuck out of my way!

412
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:25,203
(Antonio) Yo, Yo, get the fuck out I

413
00:23:25,272 --> 00:23:28,639
Hey, fuckin', Nerf, where the fuck did you get a car?

414
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:31,576
My mother let me take it out to practice for my license.

415
00:23:31,645 --> 00:23:33,112
How'd your mother get a car?

416
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,307
I gotta practice for my license.

417
00:23:35,382 --> 00:23:38,374
Hey, get off the car! Get the fuck off my car!

418
00:23:38,452 --> 00:23:39,476
What the fuck?

419
00:23:39,553 --> 00:23:41,350
(Antonio) Get in, get in. Let's go.

420
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,480
(Nerf) No, don't get in.

421
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:45,320
I'm coming back. I'm coming back.

422
00:23:45,392 --> 00:23:46,859
You're gonna leave me, then?

423
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:48,326
This thing is huge!

424
00:23:48,395 --> 00:23:49,521
I'm coming back.

425
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:51,860
(Dito) We're gonna go around the block.

426
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:53,627
What happened to your face?

427
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,827
They hit him in the face with a bottle.

428
00:23:55,902 --> 00:24:00,271
Your graffiti friends hit him with a bottle. They fucked up your mom's store.

429
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,205
Dito.

430
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:04,767
(Nerf) I don't know what you're talking about.

431
00:24:04,845 --> 00:24:06,335
Take us down to Queensbridge.

432
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:08,040
I gotta take the car back.

433
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:10,208
Take me down to Queensbridge right now.

434
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:11,478
No, I can't.

435
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:13,576
Fuck it. I'll drive.

436
00:24:13,654 --> 00:24:15,451
Alright.

437
00:24:15,522 --> 00:24:17,820
Shut up!

438
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:21,452
Are you gonna call me? I'm gonna be on this corner. You better call me, Dito.

439
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,194
Your graffiti friends hit him in the face with a bottle.

440
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:43,744
What, are you fuckin' stupid?

441
00:24:51,725 --> 00:24:53,056
What did you say?

442
00:24:53,126 --> 00:24:54,457
He's my brother.

443
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,166
You know the guy that writes graffiti around here?

444
00:25:02,235 --> 00:25:04,203
[Speaking in Spanish] No hablo ingles.

445
00:25:04,271 --> 00:25:07,172
[Antonio speaks in Spanish] No habla fuckin' I ngles.

446
00:25:09,276 --> 00:25:12,143
What the fuck you doing out so late, man?

447
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:17,382
So you know the kids that write graffiti and shit, right?

448
00:25:17,451 --> 00:25:18,748
How you know them?

449
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:24,880
Because one of, one of the members are my brother.

450
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:26,289
Is your brother?

451
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,726
Your bro... brother?

452
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:31,988
Reaper.

453
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:33,259
Reaper?

454
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:36,529
You see my friend right there?

455
00:25:37,337 --> 00:25:38,998
He's cut, right?

456
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,165
Your brother did that.

457
00:25:41,241 --> 00:25:45,678
Yeah, he cut Dito. Can you say that? Can you say his name?

458
00:25:45,746 --> 00:25:47,543
He cut Dito.

459
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:50,139
You can tell him Antonio came by? Yeah?

460
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:51,707
(Nerf) He's a little kid, man.

461
00:25:51,785 --> 00:25:54,379
You can remember to tell him that for me? He cut Dito.

462
00:25:54,454 --> 00:25:57,753
I like this kid. I like this kid. I like him.

463
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:02,658
This kid's good. Alright, I like this kid. [Kicks trash can]

464
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:07,063
Are you fuckin' stupid? What's wrong with you? Let's get out of here!

465
00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:08,567
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

466
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:10,500
I sent a little fuckin' message.

467
00:26:31,324 --> 00:26:33,087
Your father's not stupid.

468
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:38,329
(Antonio) I swear your father's a good guy, man.

469
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:40,923
If anybody ever fucked with him, forget it.

470
00:26:41,835 --> 00:26:43,700
(Flori) Antonio's not a well kid.

471
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,499
He shouldn't be hanging out with him.

472
00:26:45,572 --> 00:26:46,937
He's a good kid.

473
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:48,031
No!

474
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:50,576
I was any different? Oome on, stop it.

475
00:26:50,644 --> 00:26:53,943
You were so much different. You are a great father.

476
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:57,506
Not this guy's dad. He beats him to a pulp.

477
00:27:06,593 --> 00:27:09,460
(Antonio) He's a good guy, you know? He's a good guy.

478
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:56,038
(Dito) That's right, motherfuckerl That's the song?

479
00:27:56,109 --> 00:28:00,011
[Shouting] That's right, motherfuckerl

480
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,413
Man, I'm telling you, your band's gonna be fuckin' hardcore, man.

481
00:28:03,483 --> 00:28:05,747
Yo, Radioman, what's up, my man?

482
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:07,047
Who the fuck is that guy?

483
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,111
He's cool. Your band has to be cool.

484
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:14,718
We need to be like Black Flag, Bad Brains, U rban Waste, Major Oonflict, all of them.

485
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:16,853
Those bands rule. That's fuckin' music.

486
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:20,331
Our band needs to be cool. We need a good name.

487
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,424
For what?

488
00:28:21,501 --> 00:28:23,731
The band. This is it.

489
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:25,498
Right here?

490
00:28:25,572 --> 00:28:26,869
This is Frank?

491
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,909
What's the deal with this Frank? We can do the job together.

492
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:33,173
Definitely. He's going to go on about Job.

493
00:28:33,246 --> 00:28:35,942
You know, the guy from the Bible. J ust say you know.

494
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,240
Which one's the job?

495
00:28:38,318 --> 00:28:40,878
He's got like everything going on, man. He's cool.

496
00:28:40,954 --> 00:28:45,118
I told him you don't have to be a fag to talk like a fag.

497
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:48,820
Therefore you don't have to be a fag to have your dogs walked by a fag.

498
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:51,420
Watch the little one. I gotta go, Raul.

499
00:28:51,498 --> 00:28:55,958
I gotta call this pain in the ass before it gets too late.

500
00:28:56,036 --> 00:28:57,526
Yeah.

501
00:28:58,638 --> 00:29:01,539
Oh, unbelievable. [Telephone rings]

502
00:29:01,608 --> 00:29:03,303
Frank, this is Dito.

503
00:29:03,376 --> 00:29:05,401
H i.

504
00:29:05,478 --> 00:29:06,706
Okay.

505
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,840
M ikey, there's $1 O I owe you in dimes. It's on the floor.

506
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:12,976
Take it for train fares, okay? [Telephone rings]

507
00:29:13,053 --> 00:29:14,486
Yes?

508
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:18,285
M iss Levitt, I was just gonna call you.

509
00:29:18,358 --> 00:29:22,158
I would never take little Bobo onto the subway. Please!

510
00:29:22,996 --> 00:29:24,554
George, come here. Oome here!

511
00:29:26,466 --> 00:29:27,660
No, I'm serious.

512
00:29:27,734 --> 00:29:31,033
You gotta tell me who would say things like that about me.

513
00:29:33,406 --> 00:29:35,397
No. Wha...

514
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:39,670
I got somebody here. Let me ask. Listen, Hey!

515
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:44,206
You know the video of, uh, Lionel Richie with the blind lady?

516
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:45,444
Hello.

517
00:29:45,518 --> 00:29:47,679
Hello. Yes.

518
00:29:47,754 --> 00:29:50,416
She heard you. I love that song, too.

519
00:29:52,392 --> 00:29:53,916
Yes.

520
00:29:53,994 --> 00:29:55,894
Yes, 9: OO

522
00:29:58,264 --> 00:30:00,494
Oh! N ightmare!

523
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:03,536
Okay. Let's go. Oome on.

524
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:06,738
I got Shakespeare. Let's go, guys. Come one.

525

00:44:12,885 --> 00:44:15,319
What happened with you and Antonio? He was here.

777
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:18,754
He said you were mad at him. You had a fight or something?

778
00:44:21,627 --> 00:44:23,094
It's alright.

779
00:44:26,432 --> 00:44:28,627

What happened to you? What is this?

783
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:47,218
It's nothing.

784
00:44:48,454 --> 00:44:50,547
Hey, come on. You know me.

785
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:53,290
Rock of Gibraltar, right?

786
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:54,519

00:45:02,568 --> 00:45:03,865
No, it's just...

791
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:06,294
I'm fine, okay?

792
00:45:06,372 --> 00:45:07,930
You were on one of your journeys

793
00:45:08,007 --> 00:45:12,239
with that kid M ike in Manhattan. Antonio was telling me.

794
00:45:12,311 --> 00:45:14,108
I wasn't with Mike.

795
00:45:16,916 --> 00:45:20,249
What if I did go? What if I went to Manhattan or I went somewhere else

796
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,480
like, uh, I don't know?

797
00:45:27,459 --> 00:45:30,223

00:45:32,998 --> 00:45:34,090
Oome here.

00:45:35,935 --> 00:45:37,732
How are you, Dito, huh?

800
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:40,830
Since when are you here at this time?

801
00:45:42,107 --> 00:45:44,598
Put on the TV. Give your old man a break, huh?

802
00:46:14,673 --> 00:46:16,072
Forget it.

803
00:46:17,476 --> 00:46:19,137
Are you scared?

804
00:46:20,613 --> 00:46:22,274
I would be.

805
00:46:22,915 --> 00:46:27,011
If a guy wrote on my house "I was dead", he's already fucked you up.

806
00:46:27,086 --> 00:46:29,384
I'd be having a fuckin' heart attack.

807
00:46:33,025 --> 00:46:34,492
They just write shit.

808
00:46:35,728 --> 00:46:38,390
Locker room disinfectant stuff, right?

809
00:46:38,464 --> 00:46:40,625
Check this shit out.

810
00:46:40,699 --> 00:46:44,465

814
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,140
Wanna try it?

815
00:46:57,016 --> 00:46:58,176
What, do you drink it?

816
00:46:59,418 --> 00:47:00,544
Sniff it.

817
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,493
Mike, I'm sorry Antonio's a fuckin' asshole, man.

818
00:47:11,563 --> 00:47:15,158
He's not always like that. It's just when he gets around people and shit.

819
00:47:15,234 --> 00:47:16,826
Fuck him.

820
00:47:16,902 --> 00:47:20,838
You're always fuckin' afraid of him. Give me that shit, man.

821
00:47:21,874 --> 00:47:23,569
No, I'm not afraid.

822
00:47:23,642 --> 00:47:25,473
He's a dick.

823
00:47:31,884 --> 00:47:33,181
Fuck him.

824
00:47:37,523 --> 00:47:40,185
I'm scared, M ike. It's just...

825
00:47:40,259 --> 00:47:43,558
I'm sorry. I don't even fuckin' know what I'm saying when smoking.

826
00:47:44,897 --> 00:47:47,365
What the fuck are you sorry for, M ike?

827
00:47:47,433 --> 00:47:51,062
If some guys were after me like that, I would be shitting myself.

828
00:47:54,606 --> 00:47:56,972
Oalifornia's probably the best, right?

829
00:47:58,777 --> 00:48:00,802
I always think about that place.

830
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:02,312
Well, let's go, then.

831
00:48:02,381 --> 00:48:03,370
What do you mean?

832
00:48:03,449 --> 00:48:05,144
Let's just fucking go.

833
00:48:05,784 --> 00:48:09,151
I saw this, uh, TV commercial, right?

834
00:48:09,221 --> 00:48:12,520
You can take like a, a bus, right?

835
00:48:12,591 --> 00:48:14,456
It's $39.

836
00:48:16,095 --> 00:48:17,653
$39?

837
00:48:19,064 --> 00:48:20,725
That's crazy.

838
00:48:23,402 --> 00:48:28,169
Hey, is your fuckin' head going like boom, boom, boom? Like hard.

839
00:48:53,565 --> 00:48:55,362
[Clank]

840

Laurie.

841
00:49:03,475 --> 00:49:04,737
Laurie?

842
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:07,535

Hey, stupid, I'm not talking to you.

845
00:49:10,916 --> 00:49:12,474
I'm still not gonna talk to you.

846
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:14,246
Come on.

847
00:49:14,987 --> 00:49:17,353
I'm not talking. Why are you here?

848
00:49:17,422 --> 00:49:18,821
Why are you even here?

849
00:49:18,891 --> 00:49:20,324
'Cause I wanna be here.

850
00:49:20,392 --> 00:49:22,053
Yeah?

851
00:49:22,127 --> 00:49:23,924
Yeah.

852
00:49:28,066 --> 00:49:30,227
What's wrong? Why are you still mad?

853
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:34,933
You forgot, right? You let Giuseppe throw knives at me and Diane.

854
00:49:35,007 --> 00:49:36,770
You still mad about that?

855
00:49:36,842 --> 00:49:44,305
Like, I'm not even mad. I just feel like the whole shit was stupid, you know?

856
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:48,819
Hello? Shit.

857
00:49:50,489 --> 00:49:51,979
You're drunk.

858
00:49:52,057 --> 00:49:53,786
No.

859
00:49:53,859 --> 00:49:54,951
Oh, shit.

860
00:49:55,727 --> 00:49:58,127
You're stoned. Yeah, you are.

861
00:49:58,197 --> 00:49:59,221
No, I'm not.

862
00:49:59,298 --> 00:50:00,765
You are.

863
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,459
You know what I'm gonna do if you let me in?

864
00:50:03,569 --> 00:50:06,402
No. What you gonna do?

865
00:50:08,207 --> 00:50:10,004
I'm not even gonna fuck you.

00:50:10,075 --> 00:50:12,942
Wow! You're not gonna even fuck me!

867
00:50:13,612 --> 00:50:14,840
Not even if I let you in?

868
00:50:17,716 --> 00:50:19,343
I'm just gonna lick your pussy:

869
00:50:19,418 --> 00:50:20,908
Oh, my God.

870
00:50:20,986 --> 00:50:23,819
My mother's like right there. She can hear you right now.

871
00:50:23,889 --> 00:50:25,083
You know why?

872

No, why?

873
00:50:29,428 --> 00:50:30,690
Why what?

874
00:50:33,498 --> 00:50:34,931
What are you talking about?

875
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,901
I don't know... I don't know why you're gonna lick my pussy.

876
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:40,165
That's what you wanted me to say.

877
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:41,365
Because, uhm,

878
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,706
I'm gonna lick your pussy because me and M ike we're going to Oalifornia

879
00:50:45,777 --> 00:50:47,142

880
00:50:47,212 --> 00:50:50,045
I want you to come, you know, because I love you.

881
00:50:50,115 --> 00:50:52,515
Because the fuckin' Mets won.

882
00:50:52,584 --> 00:50:55,144
What? What did you say?

883
00:50:56,421 --> 00:50:58,048
You said you love me.

884
00:50:58,123 --> 00:50:59,147
What?

885
00:50:59,224 --> 00:51:01,215
You said you love me, right?

886
00:51:03,929 --> 00:51:06,625
I'm serious. That shit means a lot to me, you know.

887
00:51:09,601 --> 00:51:11,865
I love you. I don't why. I love you.

888
00:51:11,937 --> 00:51:13,871
' Oause I love you. 'Cause...

889
00:51:15,007 --> 00:51:16,599
I can't.

890
00:51:17,776 --> 00:51:19,676
Stupid.

891
00:51:28,453 --> 00:51:30,683
(Antonio) Hey, yo. Hey, yo,

892
00:51:30,756 --> 00:51:33,020
I stole us a Spalding from Fishbein's.

893
00:51:33,091 --> 00:51:36,060
I swear that fuckin' Oharlie his getting blind as he can be.

894
00:51:36,128 --> 00:51:38,426
I can't wait to get that motherfucker.

895
00:51:38,497 --> 00:51:41,022
I would play. I just gotta go back.

896
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:42,657
I gotta go to the city right now.

897
00:51:42,734 --> 00:51:46,101
What do you wanna go to Manhattan for? Monty wanted to play handball.

898
00:51:46,171 --> 00:51:47,433
You okay? What happened?

899
00:51:47,506 --> 00:51:50,373
It was my fuckin' father. You wanna go first to the park?

900
00:51:50,442 --> 00:51:52,876
No, I gotta fu... I gotta go fuckin' with the dogs.

901
00:51:52,945 --> 00:51:54,674
M ike with the dogs? Oome on. Hey!

902
00:51:54,746 --> 00:51:57,476
Maybe you could see if I can get a job there, man.

903
00:51:57,549 --> 00:52:00,143
Tell your friend I ain't gonna fuck with him, right?

904
00:52:00,218 --> 00:52:02,846
Maybe we can hang out later.

905
00:52:07,726 --> 00:52:09,125
Look who's here.

906
00:52:09,194 --> 00:52:11,094
Sorry. I got lost changing trains.

907
00:52:11,163 --> 00:52:15,395
Take little Geronimo here. You got to go through the teeth over here.

908
00:52:16,902 --> 00:52:20,531
Look at Young Geronimo. Oareful, motherfucker. The teeth are lethal.

909
00:52:20,605 --> 00:52:25,235
Take Bobo and Lulu too, because M iss Levitt will have a fuckin' heart attack.

910
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:28,438
You gotta go through here. Merry-go-round.

911
00:52:28,513 --> 00:52:31,346
Oould they make it a little more heat in this city or what?

912
00:52:31,416 --> 00:52:33,441
Sorry, he's blind. Poor kid.

913
00:52:33,518 --> 00:52:36,112
So this guy has a Pomeranian. Marilyn.

914
00:52:36,188 --> 00:52:39,555
You gotta walk the thing sometimes for like an hour before it craps.

915
00:52:39,624 --> 00:52:43,458
On 2nd Avenue. Bobby, the owner, he can be a real pain in the ass.

916
00:52:43,528 --> 00:52:48,124
He'll check the dog's ass. Make sure it just does it. Okay?

917
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,827
Thank you, ma'am. They're okay.

918
00:52:49,901 --> 00:52:52,233
Those things always end up with you going to hell.

919
00:52:52,304 --> 00:52:54,932
So, remember he's like an entertainment manager,

920
00:52:55,007 --> 00:52:57,703
or like he owns a store or something. Fish and lizards.

921
00:52:57,776 --> 00:52:59,505
But music, too. Whatever.

922
00:52:59,578 --> 00:53:01,512
I told him about you guys and the music,

923
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:04,913
and that maybe he should do something. You never know, okay?

924
00:53:04,983 --> 00:53:08,919
I gotta head downtown. M ikey, you have the address. You can walk from here.

925
00:53:08,987 --> 00:53:12,115
And break the leg. That's what they say in the big time.

926
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,987
Oheerio, Frank.

927
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:24,825
Your mothers must be really proud of you.

928
00:53:33,345 --> 00:53:36,109
I could jump from one side to the other like this.

929
00:53:36,181 --> 00:53:38,945
Jesse Owens would've. You're not a track star, man.

930
00:53:39,017 --> 00:53:41,781
I'm sorry. I hate to tell you this. You're not making it.

931
00:53:46,258 --> 00:53:48,055
What you think, you cute Giuseppe?

932
00:53:48,126 --> 00:53:50,458
I'm not cute. I'm handsome.

933
00:53:50,529 --> 00:53:51,860
Who the fuck told you that?

934
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:53,693
Girls.

935
00:53:53,765 --> 00:53:55,960
Go get my ball, man.

936
00:53:56,034 --> 00:53:58,764
Go get my... Go get my ball.

937
00:54:00,405 --> 00:54:02,873
Hey, Bobby.

938
00:54:02,941 --> 00:54:05,171
This is Dito.

939
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:07,336
Hey, there. I'll bring him right back.

940
00:54:07,412 --> 00:54:08,743
Thanks.

941
00:54:08,814 --> 00:54:09,974
Let's go.

942
00:54:10,048 --> 00:54:13,176
No, don't fuck with that. Oome on, man.

943
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:16,345
Touch it with your finger. With your finger.

944
00:54:16,421 --> 00:54:18,048
What the fuck are you doing, man?

945
00:54:18,123 --> 00:54:22,355
I heard if you put both feet on it at the same time, nothing happens.

946
00:54:22,427 --> 00:54:25,021
You like conduct electricity and shit.

947
00:54:25,097 --> 00:54:27,725
What are you Einstein? You sound like an idiot.

948
00:54:31,169 --> 00:54:33,535
You're worried about me, Antonio, aren't you?

949
00:54:33,605 --> 00:54:35,800
Am I fuckin' worried about you?

950
00:54:35,874 --> 00:54:40,334
The fuckin' train is coming. I don't give a fuck about you. Get my ball, man.

951
00:54:40,412 --> 00:54:42,039
You don't give a shit?

952
00:54:43,582 --> 00:54:46,517
Now how about giving a shit?

953
00:54:46,585 --> 00:54:49,554
The fuckin' train is coming. You don't see it?

954
00:54:49,621 --> 00:54:51,316
Tell me you're worried about me.

955
00:54:51,389 --> 00:54:54,916
I don't give a fuck about you. If you wanna die, go ahead. Go ahead.

956
00:54:54,993 --> 00:54:57,257
You're not gonna tell me you're worried about me?

957
00:54:57,329 --> 00:55:00,093
What the fuck? Oome on, man. Get the fuck up here.

958
00:55:00,165 --> 00:55:03,430
What the fuck are you doing? The train's coming right at you.

959
00:55:03,502 --> 00:55:05,470
You're my brother.

960
00:55:05,537 --> 00:55:07,596
The fuckin' train. It's right there.

961
00:55:07,672 --> 00:55:10,903
You're gonna be retarded and just sit down? I don't give a fuck.

962
00:55:10,976 --> 00:55:14,742
Get the fuck out already. Get he fuck out!

963
00:55:14,813 --> 00:55:17,373
Gol Get the fuck out I

00:55:44,576 --> 00:55:46,373
I was calling. You okay?

965
00:55:46,444 --> 00:55:47,468
Yeah, I'm fine.

966
00:55:47,546 --> 00:55:51,710
When I call you, you always call me back. I got worried.

967
00:55:52,751 --> 00:55:53,979
This is messed up, huh?

968
00:55:54,052 --> 00:55:57,215
It's fucked up. It's just fucked up.

969
00:55:59,591 --> 00:56:03,493
I'm getting out of here. Me and M ike we're leaving. We're going to Oalifornia.

970
00:56:03,562 --> 00:56:07,293
I know. Remember you told me? You wanted me to go with you.

971
00:56:07,365 --> 00:56:08,696
Yeah.

972
00:56:08,767 --> 00:56:11,793
What? You don't want me to go with you?

973
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:13,838
Is that what you're saying?

974
00:56:13,905 --> 00:56:16,135
I want to talk to Antonio.

975
00:56:16,208 --> 00:56:17,732
I'm just going to talk.

976
00:56:17,809 --> 00:56:21,040
Why can't you even look at me right now? You're not looking at me.

977
00:56:21,112 --> 00:56:23,171
How do you mean? How else can I look at you?

978
00:56:23,248 --> 00:56:26,342
You said that you loved me, right? Did you mean that?

979
00:56:26,418 --> 00:56:29,854
Laurie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm gonna talk to Antonio.

980
00:56:29,921 --> 00:56:32,583
You better not. You better talk to me right now.

981
00:56:39,631 --> 00:56:42,327
You okay? You okay?

982
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,131
Don't worry about it. What are you going to do? It's fucked up.

983
00:56:46,204 --> 00:56:48,900
He's, he's fucking... He's stupid.

984
00:56:48,974 --> 00:56:51,636
It's just fuckin'- - Now he's dead and he's stupid.

985
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:54,907
You know Giuseppe. He's fuckin' he's an idiot.

986
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:58,040
I found out where the fuckin' Reaper guy is.

987
00:56:58,116 --> 00:57:02,018
I found him for sure this time. I know where they hang out.

988
00:57:02,087 --> 00:57:04,817
Don't worry about that, either. I'm gonna kill his ass.

989
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:08,188
I'm here for Giuseppe. Antonio, you're here for your brother.

990
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:09,955
That's your brother in a box.

991
00:57:10,028 --> 00:57:11,325
That's your brother.

992
00:57:11,396 --> 00:57:15,059
Is that all you think about, the Reaper guy? It's your brother's funeral.

993
00:57:15,133 --> 00:57:18,398
What the fuck do you mean, "Is that all I ever fuckin' think about?

994
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:20,438
What do you mean?

995
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,835
What do you mean by that?

996
00:57:24,643 --> 00:57:25,769
What'd I say?

997
00:57:25,844 --> 00:57:30,144
All I ever think about is you? Is that what you're saying? I think about you?

998
00:57:31,049 --> 00:57:34,041
I'm asking you a fuckin' question. What did you mean by that?

999
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:36,246
I didn't mean anything by it.

1000
00:57:36,321 --> 00:57:39,256
Get the fuck out! I don't even fuckin' care about you!

1001
00:57:39,324 --> 00:57:42,316
I don't fuckin' even care. Do you hear me? I don't give a fuck.

1002

(Monty) Antoniol

1003
00:57:44,029 --> 00:57:45,621
I'm sorry, Monty.

1004
00:57:47,165 --> 00:57:49,133
Fuck! Fuck!

1005
00:57:57,809 --> 00:57:59,140
You alright?

1006
00:58:22,767 --> 00:58:24,291
Hey.

1007
00:58:24,369 --> 00:58:28,567
Do you know this used to be a candy store here? Oan you believe it?

1008

[Piano music covers voice]

1009
00:58:49,794 --> 00:58:52,854
What does the Stop mean? Do you see the hand?

1010
00:58:52,931 --> 00:58:54,262
Stop!

1011
00:58:54,332 --> 00:58:57,062
It means you don't cross the street. You stop.

1012
00:58:58,403 --> 00:58:59,665
Go.

1013
00:58:59,738 --> 00:59:03,333
Yo! Don't be making no transactions on my corner here, alright?

1014

Fuckin' Hector. Little kids here, man.

I'm serious. I'm serious, Hector.

Fuckin' television. Yo, that works?

Hey, is that's flat screen?

(Laurie) Yo, I'm serious. That works?

1020
00:59:32,637 --> 00:59:34,502
(Dito) You used to be a swimmer?

1021
00:59:34,572 --> 00:59:37,234
Oh, you used to be a swimmer, right?

1022

Hey.

Joseph. M r. Joey.

1027
00:59:52,724 --> 00:59:54,351
Joey, like Giuseppe?

1028
00:59:57,395 --> 00:59:59,226
Like Joseph.

1029
00:59:59,297 --> 01:00:00,992
It's his father's name. Joseph.

1030
01:00:01,065 --> 01:00:02,396
Mommy, who's that man?

1031
01:00:02,467 --> 01:00:05,527
He's gone now. He wants to know who you are.

1032
01:00:05,603 --> 01:00:08,595
I've known your mother since she was, like, she was this big.

1033
01:00:08,673 --> 01:00:11,039
She can't be this big, you know.

1034
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:13,339
[Laughs]

1035
01:00:13,411 --> 01:00:15,743
Your mom said you were coming into town.

1036
01:00:15,814 --> 01:00:17,679
Yeah, I'm gonna see my father.

1037
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:21,585
Yeah, Nerf told me, you know, you'd be here in your corner.

1038
01:00:21,653 --> 01:00:23,621
My corner. Nerf.

1039
01:00:26,124 --> 01:00:27,216
Wow.

1040
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:29,786
Wow.

1041
01:00:29,861 --> 01:00:32,728
Laurie, you look beautiful.

1042
01:00:32,797 --> 01:00:34,628
You know, I'm in my bests.

1043
01:00:34,699 --> 01:00:37,327
I'm looking really good. My best slippers.

1044
01:00:37,402 --> 01:00:39,700
You should see them actually. Manolo's.

1045
01:00:42,273 --> 01:00:44,605
You're staying at your mother's, right?

01:00:55,487 --> 01:00:56,954
You wanna come down and play.

1051
01:00:58,857 --> 01:01:02,224
It was really nice to see you. I gotta make dinner now.

1052
01:01:02,927 --> 01:01:04,485
It's good to see you.

1053

Yo, Antonio.

I know where he's been, since he's all I have to think about.

1061
01:01:56,948 --> 01:01:58,438
He's all I have to think about.

1062
01:01:58,516 --> 01:01:59,608
I'm fuckin' working.

1063
01:01:59,684 --> 01:02:01,845
What are you always fuckin' pissed off for?

1064
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,287
I'm not pissed off. You know your father had a seizure?

1065
01:02:05,356 --> 01:02:08,723
This guy don't even know his fuckin' father had a seizure.

1066
01:02:08,793 --> 01:02:10,852
He's acting like there's nothing wrong.

1067
01:02:10,929 --> 01:02:12,726
You're in fuckin' N iggerville.

1068
01:02:12,797 --> 01:02:15,288
Nerf's dad is black. What happened to my father?

1069
01:02:15,366 --> 01:02:16,731
My father's Dominican.

1070
01:02:16,801 --> 01:02:19,133
Nerf's fuckin' Nerf, man.

1071

You're never around anymore. Where the fuck were you?

01:02:22,006 --> 01:02:23,871
Where the fuck are you? Nowhere!

1073

Look, yo, you don't think I'd fuck you up?

01:02:33,418 --> 01:02:34,476
Ohill out, Antonio.

You have no idea how fuckin' close you are. Nerf, let's just fuckin' go.

1079
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:40,582
Antoniol

What's up, motherfucker? Think you can hide from me?

1082
01:03:05,717 --> 01:03:07,981
Think you can fuck with my family?

1083

Think you can fuck with my family, nigger?

1084
01:03:14,459 --> 01:03:16,188
[Dito shouts in pain]

1085
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,626
Don't fuck with me 'cause I know your family.

1086
01:03:18,696 --> 01:03:20,891
I know your father. I know where you live.

1087
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,026
Don't fuck with TS S! Next time I'll kill you. That's my word.

1088
01:03:25,103 --> 01:03:29,472
I know your family. I know you live right here. Don't ever fuck with me!

[Men laugh]

1091
01:03:37,348 --> 01:03:39,111
You're scared.

1092
01:03:42,787 --> 01:03:45,654

Don't be mad, okay?

1098
01:03:56,868 --> 01:03:58,665
No, no. Nerf, get your mother's car.

1099
01:03:58,736 --> 01:04:00,897
Go get your mother's car right now.

01:04:00,972 --> 01:04:04,499
You're fucked up. That fuckin' It's...

[soft music covers voice]

1103
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:23,418
Every day something's different with you guys. I don't know what it is.

1104
01:04:23,494 --> 01:04:27,021
Every day is something, huh? Right, Antonio? Every day is something.

1105
01:04:27,098 --> 01:04:28,622
Yeah.

1106
01:04:31,135 --> 01:04:34,298
So what happened this time? A dog bite you? H uh?

1107
01:04:34,372 --> 01:04:36,101
I told you I fell off a park fence.

1108
01:04:36,174 --> 01:04:38,335
Oh, you fell off a fence?

1109
01:04:40,311 --> 01:04:43,144
Never mind about that, okay? J ust tell me what happened.

1110
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:47,278
H i.

1111
01:04:47,351 --> 01:04:49,012
It's 2: OO in the morning.

1112
01:04:49,087 --> 01:04:51,419
(Laurie) I just wanted to see what happened.

1113
01:04:53,624 --> 01:04:55,182
Sorry.

1114
01:04:55,259 --> 01:04:57,193
What happened?

1115
01:04:58,129 --> 01:05:00,620
There, now you see. Now go.

1116
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,964
I said I just want to know what happened.

1117
01:05:05,036 --> 01:05:09,370
The freaking graffiti guys. You know, the Reaper. Your fuckin' race.

1118
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,135
They whacked him with a bat.

1119
01:05:11,209 --> 01:05:13,006
It's not my race.

1120
01:05:13,077 --> 01:05:16,513
(Flori) Monty? What are you doing out there?

1121
01:05:16,581 --> 01:05:20,779
U h, don't worry, Flori. I'm talking to Dito and Antonio, okay?

1122
01:05:20,852 --> 01:05:23,650
It's so latel

1123
01:05:24,956 --> 01:05:27,754
These guys, they knew who you were, too.

1124
01:05:27,825 --> 01:05:29,816
The Reaper guy. The bat man.

1125
01:05:29,894 --> 01:05:33,022
But don't worry about it. We'll take care of it. J ust trust me.

1126
01:05:33,097 --> 01:05:34,325
Why do they care who I am?

1127
01:05:34,398 --> 01:05:37,993
They care who you are. These guys are crazy, M r. Montiel.

1128
01:05:40,772 --> 01:05:46,267
Daddy, me and M ike are planning a trip to go to Oalifornia for a month.

1129
01:05:46,344 --> 01:05:50,246
Listen to Antonio, okay? What do you mean you wanna go somewhere?

1130
01:05:50,314 --> 01:05:52,339
You wanna go to Ohina, go to Ohina Town.

1131
01:05:52,416 --> 01:05:54,850
You don't even listen to anything.

1132
01:05:54,919 --> 01:05:58,184
I'm sorry. I just feel you're not listening to what he's saying.

1133
01:05:58,256 --> 01:05:59,917
Sorry, daddy. I'm serious.

1134
01:05:59,991 --> 01:06:02,653
You said to me that if I were to leave,

1135
01:06:02,727 --> 01:06:04,922
that you wouldn't talk to me anymore.

1136
01:06:04,996 --> 01:06:07,123
And if I were to go, would you not talk to me?

1137
01:06:07,198 --> 01:06:09,166
That's what you said you were gonna do.

1138
01:06:09,233 --> 01:06:11,758
But you're not going anywhere, Dito.

1139
01:06:13,104 --> 01:06:17,200
You're not going anywhere. You stay right here at home with us, okay?

1140
01:06:17,842 --> 01:06:20,242
Daddy, can you be my fuckin' father for a second?

1141
01:06:20,311 --> 01:06:24,475
I wanna go somewhere. I wanna do something for once. I can't be here anymore.

1142
01:06:24,549 --> 01:06:25,743
It's a nightmare here.

1143
01:06:25,817 --> 01:06:27,546
(Flori) What's going on out there?

1144
01:06:27,618 --> 01:06:30,348
Flori, wait a minute. Everything's gonna be alright.

1145
01:06:30,421 --> 01:06:33,015
Who do you think you are talking to me like that?

1146
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:34,216
He's your son.

1147
01:06:34,292 --> 01:06:37,318
J ust mind your business. I told you to mind your business.

1148
01:06:37,395 --> 01:06:39,454
Alright. You wanna go, then go!

1149
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:41,623
Is that what you wanna hear? Then go.

1150
01:06:41,699 --> 01:06:43,963
Don't you ever talk to me like that again.

1151
01:06:44,035 --> 01:06:46,970
Antonio is gonna make everything right. Right, Antonio?

1152
01:06:47,038 --> 01:06:50,735
He's gonna make it right. Yes! He's gonna make it right!

1153
01:06:50,808 --> 01:06:52,207
He's gonna take care, okay?

1154
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:55,302
Why don't you shut the fuck up? Listen to him. Why don't you leave my fuckin house?

1155
01:06:56,113 --> 01:06:58,843
Listen to me. Antonio, you are going to make it right?

1156
01:06:58,916 --> 01:07:00,679
You're gonna make it right, right?

1157
01:07:00,785 --> 01:07:02,980
[Dito and Laurie argue] He's not going nowhere.

1158
01:07:03,054 --> 01:07:07,115
Get he fuck out of my house! Get the fuck out of my house.

1159
01:07:07,191 --> 01:07:10,456
Hey, hey. Hey! What are you doing?

1160
01:07:10,528 --> 01:07:13,224
Get the fuck out. I hate you!

1161
01:07:13,297 --> 01:07:16,528
What the hell are you saying to me? You hate your father?

1162
01:07:17,568 --> 01:07:19,627
Hey, fuck, relaxl

1163
01:07:20,938 --> 01:07:22,030
Monty?

1164
01:07:34,585 --> 01:07:35,847
Hold his head!

1165
01:07:41,392 --> 01:07:44,122
(Antonio) Dito, where are you going?

1166
01:07:45,263 --> 01:07:46,525
What is happening?

1167
01:07:55,106 --> 01:07:57,904
You'll be alright. You'll be alright.

1168
01:07:59,443 --> 01:08:00,933
You'll be alright.

1169
01:08:59,737 --> 01:09:01,295
[Whispers] Dito.

1170
01:09:03,374 --> 01:09:04,864
H i.

1171
01:09:06,177 --> 01:09:08,270

[Whispers] Look at you.

01:09:17,555 --> 01:09:19,182
You're beautiful.

1175
01:09:25,463 --> 01:09:27,090
Momma, you do.

1176
01:09:33,537 --> 01:09:34,526
Monty?

1177
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:39,509
Monty. Look who's here.

1178
01:09:45,383 --> 01:09:47,874
Hey. Look at you.

1179
01:09:47,952 --> 01:09:49,510
Long time no see.

1180
01:09:57,161 --> 01:09:58,321
Daddy.

1181
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:01,790
Antonio and Nerf called. Said you were sick.

1182
01:10:05,036 --> 01:10:07,800
Me? Rock of Gibraltar, man.

1183
01:10:15,579 --> 01:10:17,206
You don't look so good.

1184
01:10:21,218 --> 01:10:24,745
He came all this way to tell me I don't look so good, Flori?

1185
01:10:28,893 --> 01:10:30,224
No.

1186
01:10:31,295 --> 01:10:35,288
He's here to take you to the hospital because you're sick, right?

1187
01:10:39,570 --> 01:10:43,165
Well... thanks for coming. You take care, okay?

1188
01:10:44,141 --> 01:10:45,506
Take care?

1189
01:10:45,576 --> 01:10:47,510
When I came all the way here to see you?

1190
01:10:47,578 --> 01:10:50,706
Dito, it's nice to see you again.

1191
01:10:50,781 --> 01:10:53,011
You came and everything. Now you take care.

1192
01:10:53,084 --> 01:10:55,143
I see what he's doing.

1193
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,718
Nice. I see what you're doing.

1194
01:10:59,356 --> 01:11:01,722
That's because you're a very smart guy.

1195
01:11:01,792 --> 01:11:06,126
Well, I'm your son. You know that, right?

1196
01:11:06,197 --> 01:11:07,630
You're my son?

1197
01:11:07,698 --> 01:11:09,222
Yeah, I'm your son. Remember?

1198
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:12,360
You're my son? You're not my son.

1199
01:11:15,372 --> 01:11:17,636
I'm not gonna fight.

1200
01:11:17,708 --> 01:11:19,232
You want me to leave?

1201
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:21,175
Big shot comes here.

1202
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:26,207
Comes 15, comes 3, 000 miles.

1203
01:11:26,283 --> 01:11:30,811
From co... Comes 3, 000 miles in 15 years.

1204
01:11:30,888 --> 01:11:34,221
You go back to California like the rat you are.

1205
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:37,692
You leave me, your mother.

1206
01:11:37,761 --> 01:11:40,787
You don't see your friend Antonio.

1207
01:11:40,865 --> 01:11:42,059
Monty.

1208
01:11:42,133 --> 01:11:45,398
Not oncel Oncel

1209
01:11:48,539 --> 01:11:51,599
You can go. You take care.

1210
01:12:30,581 --> 01:12:33,482
Used to be Antonio's house.

1211
01:12:33,551 --> 01:12:36,019
House of horrors. The poor kid.

1212
01:12:38,055 --> 01:12:40,546
Look how nice it is now.

1213
01:12:40,624 --> 01:12:42,285
It's nice, huh?

1214
01:12:47,097 --> 01:12:50,624
I wasn't upset when he went to prison. Not a bit.

1215
01:12:50,701 --> 01:12:52,999
That's where me and you father are different.

1216
01:12:56,440 --> 01:13:02,401
You know, if you hooked your father up to a lie detector test

1217
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:07,314
and asked if he was the best father whoever lived ever,

1218
01:13:07,384 --> 01:13:10,114
he'd pass with flying colors.

1219
01:13:11,722 --> 01:13:15,749
That's because he loved you with everything he had.

1220
01:13:15,826 --> 01:13:18,624
Every last bit. He loved you.

1221
01:13:19,930 --> 01:13:22,296
He loved coming up here with you.

1222
01:13:25,569 --> 01:13:29,005
You know, people used to think he was your grandfather.

1223
01:13:30,074 --> 01:13:32,235
He thought that was funny.

1224
01:13:32,309 --> 01:13:37,611
You know, one generation can be funny, I guess. But two?

1225
01:13:37,681 --> 01:13:40,946
We were too old to have such a young boy.

1226
01:13:44,955 --> 01:13:50,359
We needed you probably more than you needed us. Or, you know.

1227
01:13:51,662 --> 01:13:54,222
Your father was so crazy about you.

1228
01:13:54,298 --> 01:13:56,892
I never saw nothing like it.

1229
01:13:59,503 --> 01:14:01,698
You were more his buddy than a son.

1230
01:14:01,772 --> 01:14:04,536
He couldn't wait for you to come out and play.

1231
01:14:08,679 --> 01:14:10,374
I'm sorry, Ma.

1232
01:14:12,616 --> 01:14:17,644
You can't come back with hatred for your father. You can't.

1233
01:14:18,856 --> 01:14:24,055
How could you love him so much in that book and not see him for so long?

1234
01:14:28,565 --> 01:14:31,056
I know you have your reasons.

1235
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:35,229
We all missed you here.

1236
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,403
You're my son, too.

1237
01:14:43,981 --> 01:14:45,414
Look at you.

1238
01:14:48,018 --> 01:14:49,815
You're a man now.

1239
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:05,032
It's good to see you again.

1240
01:15:06,837 --> 01:15:09,704
To say your name to you.

1241
01:15:21,885 --> 01:15:24,911
I thought of this every day, and now it's here.

1242
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:27,782
Every day.

1243
01:15:32,463 --> 01:15:35,728
[Indistinct talking of girls]

1244
01:15:39,436 --> 01:15:40,767
You asked your dad, right?

1245
01:15:42,106 --> 01:15:45,041
How can we afford Oalifornia?

1246
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:48,204
Frank.

1247
01:15:48,278 --> 01:15:51,873
Remember the commercial you told me about? You told me about that.

1248
01:15:52,649 --> 01:15:55,015
I saw it. The $39-buses.

1249
01:15:55,919 --> 01:15:57,944
We get the money from Frank and we can go.

1250
01:16:00,257 --> 01:16:03,192
Hey, Ronnie, give her her shirt back.

1251
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:05,751
I just wanna get the fuck out of here.

1252
01:16:06,897 --> 01:16:10,128
I'm not gonna go without you. And we're going, right?

1253
01:16:11,368 --> 01:16:12,665
Yeah.

1254
01:16:15,172 --> 01:16:16,764
I want my fuckin' shirt back.

1255
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:19,331
Oan you give her back her frigging shirt?

1256
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:23,540
I'm serious, Ronnie. I'm serious. Ronniel

1257
01:16:26,784 --> 01:16:30,777
Ronnie! Give her the fuckin' shirt back.

1258
01:16:30,854 --> 01:16:34,119
Why you do this every time? Fuckin' little pervert.

1259
01:16:34,758 --> 01:16:35,952
Here.

1260
01:16:36,026 --> 01:16:38,790
I gave you your shirt. Tell your friend to talk to me.

1261
01:16:38,862 --> 01:16:40,989
Your friend has a mind of her own.

1262
01:16:41,064 --> 01:16:42,895
Tell your mind to talk to me.

1263
01:16:42,966 --> 01:16:47,062
My mind is not gonna talk to you. I don't wanna talk to you.

1264
01:16:47,137 --> 01:16:49,435
You don't think I'm not gonna get in there now?

1265
01:16:49,506 --> 01:16:50,871
You're not gonna get in.

1266
01:16:55,145 --> 01:16:57,238
You didn't think I was gonna get in?

1267
01:16:58,048 --> 01:16:59,276
H uh?

1268
01:17:01,485 --> 01:17:04,886
I'm sorry, Laurie. At my fuckin' house I didn't mean to...

1269
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:09,088
I didn't mean to.

1270
01:17:09,159 --> 01:17:12,151
You were so mean to me. You were really mean to me.

1271
01:17:12,229 --> 01:17:13,423
I was pissed off.

1272
01:17:13,497 --> 01:17:16,227
I was pissed off. I lost it, you know. I fuckin'- -

1273
01:17:18,735 --> 01:17:20,100
What is that?

1274
01:17:21,405 --> 01:17:23,930
Is that a bruise? I did that to you?

1275
01:17:24,007 --> 01:17:25,440
Yeah.

1276
01:17:25,509 --> 01:17:27,534
Don't worry. I bruise easily. It's fine.

1277
01:17:27,611 --> 01:17:28,908
When I grabbed you?

1278
01:17:30,147 --> 01:17:31,580
Yo, Dito.

1279
01:17:31,648 --> 01:17:36,142
The Reaper's over there. Let's go. Get up out of the pool.

1280
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:40,350
Antonio found the dude that hit you with the bat. He's waiting for you.

1281
01:17:40,424 --> 01:17:42,688
Oome on!

1282
01:17:42,759 --> 01:17:44,886
You going over there is so fuckin' stupid.

1283
01:17:44,962 --> 01:17:46,520
Let's go! Dito, come on, man.

1284
01:17:46,597 --> 01:17:50,158
You don't need that fuckin' asshole. He is the fuckin' worst!

1285
01:17:50,234 --> 01:17:53,431
Where are you going? You're so full of shit, man.

1286
01:17:53,504 --> 01:17:56,598
You wanna get out of here, but you're running after Antonio.

1287
01:17:56,673 --> 01:18:00,632
The guy's a fuckin' dick, Dito. It's because of him you're fucked up.

1288
01:18:00,711 --> 01:18:02,838
Fuckin' go then! Go!

1289
01:18:02,913 --> 01:18:03,902
I'll be right back.

1290
01:18:03,981 --> 01:18:05,846
You're not coming back!

1291
01:18:27,971 --> 01:18:29,632
What's up, Dito?

1292
01:18:29,706 --> 01:18:32,106
The fuckin' spic is right there, man.

1293
01:18:33,744 --> 01:18:35,177
Nerf told you, right?

1294
01:18:35,245 --> 01:18:36,473
Yeah.

1295
01:18:36,547 --> 01:18:38,515
That's our motherfucker right there.

1296
01:18:42,219 --> 01:18:44,244
He's in there playing Asteroids.

1297
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:51,187
Yo, get down. Get down.

1298
01:18:54,464 --> 01:18:56,591
Yeah, let him go. Let him go.

[Both laugh]

1300
01:19:01,338 --> 01:19:03,135
He'll be there all alone.

1301
01:19:04,975 --> 01:19:06,840
I'm gonna show this fucker what's up.

1302
01:19:53,991 --> 01:19:55,720
(Dito) Frank?

1303
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:58,384
Frank?

1304
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:14,568
Oh, shit.

1305
01:20:17,047 --> 01:20:20,039
What's up? Is it Saturday?

1306
01:20:21,551 --> 01:20:23,018
It ain't Saturday, Frank.

1307
01:20:24,554 --> 01:20:26,988
Sit down. Sit down.

1308
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:32,726
Frank, we need our money. Remember I was telling you...

1309
01:20:32,796 --> 01:20:35,959
You guys know this shit's no good. H uh?

1310
01:20:36,033 --> 01:20:39,434
You like this song? You can hear it, right?

1311
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:41,467
Listen, listen, listen.

1312
01:20:43,507 --> 01:20:45,998
Oh, fuck! Did you hear that?

1313
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:47,941
Did you hear that?

1314
01:20:49,312 --> 01:20:51,803
It's like... Oh, I love it.

1315
01:20:56,787 --> 01:20:57,981
Right?

1316
01:21:02,693 --> 01:21:05,127
And these things like fuckin' ultrasonic.

1317
01:21:05,195 --> 01:21:07,720
They're like walkie talkie shit. But in your head.

1318
01:21:07,798 --> 01:21:10,995
Like, it sounds there but it's in here, too. You know what I mean?

1319
01:21:11,068 --> 01:21:14,003
It sounds there but it's in here, too. You know what I mean?

1320
01:21:14,071 --> 01:21:16,130
Walkie talkie shit, I'm telling ya.

1321
01:21:16,206 --> 01:21:20,643
Out there, in here. Out there, in here. It's amazing.

1322
01:21:20,711 --> 01:21:24,943
Frank, you ain't paid us for three weeks.

Damn. This shit is impossiblel You hear that?

[Sniffs]

1325
01:21:33,290 --> 01:21:36,350
Oome on, Frank. We know the fuckin' money's in the fridge.

01:21:36,426 --> 01:21:40,362
Fucking great song. I love this song.

1327
01:21:40,430 --> 01:21:42,455
I love this song.

1328
01:21:42,532 --> 01:21:46,764
Frank, enough shit already. The fuckin' money's in the fridge.

1329
01:21:47,571 --> 01:21:50,506
Either you get it for us or we're gonna take it.

1330
01:21:51,141 --> 01:21:52,665
What are you gonna do?

1331
01:21:54,878 --> 01:21:56,140
Wait.

1332
01:21:57,614 --> 01:22:00,139
M ikey, you came here to rob me?

1333
01:22:00,217 --> 01:22:02,583
Frank, we're friends, man.

1334
01:22:02,652 --> 01:22:04,449
I didn't come to rob you.

1335
01:22:04,521 --> 01:22:06,955
Frank, we didn't come here to rob you.

1336
01:22:07,023 --> 01:22:08,888
We just want to get paid, you know.

1337
01:22:08,959 --> 01:22:11,484
You haven't paid us for three fuckin' weeks.

1338
01:22:12,095 --> 01:22:14,461
Three weeks? I haven't paid you in three weeks?

01:22:19,503 --> 01:22:21,027
Okay.

1341
01:22:21,104 --> 01:22:23,732
I mean, it's cool. It's cool. I owe you money.

1342
01:22:23,807 --> 01:22:25,775

[closes fridge door]

1344

I got a gun in here too, you know.

1345
01:22:32,816 --> 01:22:34,807
And if you rob me, you know,

1346
01:22:36,253 --> 01:22:38,585
I would've had to have used it.

1347
01:22:40,457 --> 01:22:43,187
But I wouldn't. I would never. I'm sorry.

1348
01:22:44,361 --> 01:22:45,794
How much do I owe you?

1349

1350
01:22:47,330 --> 01:22:48,558
Three hundred for both.

1351
01:22:48,632 --> 01:22:50,065
Three hundred.

1352
01:22:52,002 --> 01:22:53,629
[Sniffs] You know what?

1353
01:22:54,905 --> 01:22:57,203
Take it all, M ike. Take it all.

1354
01:22:57,274 --> 01:23:00,971
It's only $3OO, Frank. All we want is what we're owed. We're not asking...

1355
01:23:02,179 --> 01:23:06,047
Like Job. Remember from the Bible?

1356
01:23:06,883 --> 01:23:10,216
Like him. You're so good, M ikey. You're so good.

1357
01:23:10,287 --> 01:23:13,950
But here is no good anymore. Here is no good.

1358
01:23:14,024 --> 01:23:17,960
You're always talking about the music, or Oalifornia.

1359
01:23:18,028 --> 01:23:20,826
Here's no good anymore, okay?

1360
01:23:20,897 --> 01:23:24,765
Here's no good anymore. Take it! J ust take the money, please.

1361

(Puerto Rican kid) Yeah, yeah. That's me.

1372
01:24:17,287 --> 01:24:18,515
Yeah.

1373
01:24:23,126 --> 01:24:28,428
No conscience. No conscience. These motherfuckers.

1374
01:24:30,901 --> 01:24:34,302
Do what they want. Do exactly what they want.

1375
01:24:39,409 --> 01:24:43,106
No conscience. No conscience. These motherfuckers.

1376
01:24:43,747 --> 01:24:46,875
You show them what's up. What's right.

1377
01:24:49,319 --> 01:24:51,719
You go, boy. You go.

Pow I

1379
01:25:15,312 --> 01:25:18,076
I was afraid maybe you drowned in here or something.

1380
01:25:25,555 --> 01:25:27,580
Listen, Dito.

1381
01:25:29,659 --> 01:25:33,789
U hm, you know, this thing with Antonio, you know,

1382
01:25:38,935 --> 01:25:40,835
you know, don't worry.

1383
01:25:42,305 --> 01:25:43,636
You're kids.

1384
01:25:43,707 --> 01:25:46,267
I spoke to the guy, the guy with the suit.

1385
01:25:46,343 --> 01:25:48,311
He said everything is gonna be okay.

1386
01:25:48,378 --> 01:25:50,710
It's gonna be good. He's gonna take care of it.

1387
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:53,044
I'm not worried about it. Okay?

1388
01:25:56,486 --> 01:25:59,887
I'm sorry I ran away when you had the seizure, dad. [Sniffs]

1389
01:26:06,896 --> 01:26:07,988
Don't worry.

1390
01:26:08,698 --> 01:26:10,632
Monday, instead of going to school,

1391
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:13,931
you take your I D card. You go to Riker's Island, you see Antonio.

1392
01:26:14,004 --> 01:26:16,063
Take your friend M ike. He's a good kid.

1393
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:19,074
Daddy, I wanted to tell you that...

1394
01:26:19,142 --> 01:26:21,838
I know. I just want you to understand everything.

1395
01:26:21,911 --> 01:26:25,176
I like Antonio. Yeah.

1396
01:26:25,248 --> 01:26:27,773
Why don't you ever listen to anything I ever say?

1397
01:26:27,851 --> 01:26:29,910
I'm listening to you. Listen to me.

1398
01:26:29,986 --> 01:26:33,149
It's gonna be okay. Alright?

1399
01:26:35,492 --> 01:26:36,754
Don't fuckin' touch me.

1400
01:26:36,826 --> 01:26:37,815
Listen to me.

1401
01:26:37,894 --> 01:26:40,886
Get the fuck off me! Don't touch me. Don't fuckin' touch me.

1402
01:26:40,964 --> 01:26:43,194
[Shouting] Don't you talk to me like that I

1403
01:26:43,266 --> 01:26:46,292
Don't you raise your voice to me!

1404
01:26:46,369 --> 01:26:48,963
Your my son. Oome on. Dito.

1405
01:26:49,039 --> 01:26:50,700
Get the fuck off me!

1406
01:26:50,774 --> 01:26:54,710
What's the matter with you? It's gonna be alright. Do you hear what I'm saying?

1407
01:26:54,778 --> 01:26:57,303
It's gonna be okay. It will be okay.

1408
01:26:57,380 --> 01:27:01,578
My friend M ike just died, dad. He just got fuckin' shot. You don't know whats happening.

1409
01:27:01,651 --> 01:27:03,642
What are you talking about? What happened?

1410
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:05,915
My friend M ike is dead.

1411
01:27:05,989 --> 01:27:07,081
Oome here.

1412
01:27:07,157 --> 01:27:10,354
Don't fuckin' touch me! Please, get the fuck off me!

1413
01:27:10,427 --> 01:27:12,088
What is the matter with you?

1414
01:27:12,162 --> 01:27:14,323
You don't raise your hands to your father!

1415
01:27:14,397 --> 01:27:17,924
You don't raise your hands to your father. I love you.

1416
01:27:18,001 --> 01:27:20,492
I'm asking you not to fuckin' touch me!

1417
01:27:20,570 --> 01:27:23,198
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1418
01:27:24,774 --> 01:27:27,436
Don't you fuckin' do it!

1419
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:30,308
Don't you raise your hands to me again!

1420
01:27:31,081 --> 01:27:32,776
I'm your father.

1421
01:27:33,550 --> 01:27:36,280
You're not supposed to hate your father.

1422
01:27:36,352 --> 01:27:38,377
When are you my father?

1423
01:27:40,256 --> 01:27:42,486
When are you my father? [Sobs]

1424
01:28:05,115 --> 01:28:06,707
(Laurie) You know, I, uh,

1425
01:28:07,484 --> 01:28:11,716
I waited around for a year at my window when you left.

1426
01:28:12,388 --> 01:28:15,915
I bought Oalifornia maps.

1427
01:28:15,992 --> 01:28:18,790
Any time I heard anything about it, I would think of you.

1428
01:28:20,130 --> 01:28:21,791
Embarrassing.

1429
01:28:24,267 --> 01:28:25,700
Dumb little girl.

1430
01:28:29,105 --> 01:28:32,541
Listen, I'm not heartbroken about it, alright? I'm over that shit.

1431
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:36,838
I was just a dumb girl. We were fuckin' kids. Whatever.

1432
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:39,848
But you need to take your father to the hospital.

1433
01:28:42,519 --> 01:28:44,009
I mean, your mother...

1434
01:28:46,556 --> 01:28:48,319
I'm serious.

1435
01:28:49,926 --> 01:28:52,417
I got a little boy. He's a good kid.

1436
01:28:52,495 --> 01:28:54,929
And he's gonna look after me when we're older.

1437
01:28:56,766 --> 01:29:01,169
So you look after your mother. You take care of your father. You take care of your mother.

1438
01:29:02,138 --> 01:29:05,164
It's real simple. 'Cause she's a good woman.

1439
01:29:05,241 --> 01:29:06,674
It's not a fuckin' stretch.

1440
01:29:06,743 --> 01:29:08,904
I know what you're saying. Alright?

1441
01:29:08,978 --> 01:29:11,003
Thanks for coming. I should go.

1442
01:29:11,915 --> 01:29:13,075
Wow.

1443
01:29:16,052 --> 01:29:17,986
Monty's son.

1444
01:29:20,056 --> 01:29:22,422
You know what? You're Flori's son as well.

1445
01:29:22,492 --> 01:29:24,357
And that's why you're all fucked up.

1446
01:29:24,427 --> 01:29:25,621
Yeah, I'm all fucked up.

1447
01:29:25,728 --> 01:29:29,459
You think you're going? You're gonna fuckin' leave? Go ahead, fuckin' go.

1448
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:31,999
You're not gonna go.

1449
01:29:33,369 --> 01:29:36,702
You didn't fuckin' come all the way over so you could leave again.

1450
01:29:36,773 --> 01:29:38,172
You don't know.

1451
01:29:38,241 --> 01:29:41,301
You don't know what it was like in the house, okay?

1452
01:29:41,978 --> 01:29:43,969
Listen. You want it straight?

1453
01:29:44,047 --> 01:29:47,483
'Cause I'm the only one who's gonna tell you for some fuckin' reason.

1454
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:51,179
You killed him. You killed your father when you left.

1455
01:29:52,422 --> 01:29:54,617
Are you hearing me? You fuckin' killed him.

1456
01:29:54,691 --> 01:29:57,785
You left a trail of blood when you left.

1457
01:29:57,860 --> 01:30:01,387
So forget me. Forget all this shit. Forget it, alright?

1458
01:30:01,464 --> 01:30:04,297
You killed your mother and you killed your father.

1459
01:30:04,367 --> 01:30:07,097
And for the past fuckin' 2O years he's been dying,

1460
01:30:07,170 --> 01:30:09,604
just waiting for you to come home.

1461
01:30:09,672 --> 01:30:12,038
Say daddy, you're fucked up. I hate your guts.

1462
01:30:12,108 --> 01:30:15,305
Whatever you need to get out of your angsty little fuckin' head.

1463
01:30:15,378 --> 01:30:18,211
Touch my head one more fuckin' time and I'm gonna go nuts.

1464
01:30:18,281 --> 01:30:20,306
Go ahead. Go fuckin' nuts.

1465
01:30:20,383 --> 01:30:23,944
Go fuckin' nuts. Let it out! Stop fuckin' running away.

1466
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:28,081
You think you're a man? That's just a fuckin' tail between your legs.

1467
01:30:28,157 --> 01:30:30,318
Go home and take care of your mother.

1468
01:30:30,393 --> 01:30:32,190
Go home and take care of your father.

1469
01:30:32,262 --> 01:30:34,890
That's gonna make you a fuckin' man.

1470
01:30:34,964 --> 01:30:36,727
That's all you've got left.

1471
01:30:36,799 --> 01:30:39,666
'Cause if you don't do that shit, it's too fuckin' late.

1472
01:30:39,736 --> 01:30:40,862
Okay, bye.

1473
01:30:40,937 --> 01:30:42,302
Yeah.

1474
01:30:47,744 --> 01:30:49,234
You're going to hospital.

1475
01:30:49,312 --> 01:30:50,745
Where's Ma?

1476
01:30:51,648 --> 01:30:53,775
Ma? Where is she?

1477
01:30:53,850 --> 01:30:55,283
Why don't you get out?

1478
01:30:57,086 --> 01:30:58,212
Get out of the house.

1479
01:30:58,288 --> 01:31:00,518
Did you love me? Ever?

1480
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:01,716
I said go.

1481
01:31:01,791 --> 01:31:04,055
Dad, did you love me or not?

1482
01:31:04,127 --> 01:31:05,560
Daddy, I gotta know.

1483
01:31:06,562 --> 01:31:09,827
Lie to me and tell me you did. Let me feel like the piece of shit I am.

1484
01:31:09,899 --> 01:31:11,628
Did you love me or not?

1485
01:31:13,403 --> 01:31:15,462
[Shouting] Answer me!

1486
01:31:15,538 --> 01:31:16,596
A father always...

1487
01:31:16,673 --> 01:31:18,800
Not a father! You!

1488
01:31:31,654 --> 01:31:33,519
Of course I did.

1489
01:31:47,303 --> 01:31:50,238
I told you I loved you the last time I saw you.

1490
01:32:02,919 --> 01:32:06,013
I love you, Dito. Alright?

1491
01:32:06,089 --> 01:32:08,421
You're my son. I'm very proud of you.

1492
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:12,091
Now, Antonio,

1493
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:16,665
he doesn't have anybody to tell him something like this.

1494
01:32:20,169 --> 01:32:24,333
Listen, Monday you don't have to go to school.

1495
01:32:25,742 --> 01:32:28,711
Monday you take your I D.

1496
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:31,972
You go to Riker's.

1497
01:32:33,015 --> 01:32:34,710
You see Antonio.

1498
01:32:36,452 --> 01:32:38,317
Take your friend Mike with you.

1499
01:32:39,789 --> 01:32:41,484
I like that kid.

1500
01:32:43,559 --> 01:32:45,993
You take the bus there with your friend.

1501
01:32:46,629 --> 01:32:48,028
You go see Antonio.

1502
01:32:48,097 --> 01:32:49,530
Yeah, man.

1503
01:32:52,535 --> 01:32:53,729
Have fun.

1504
01:32:56,239 --> 01:32:58,036
You're just kids, Dito.

1505
01:32:59,075 --> 01:33:01,066
J ust kids.

1506
01:33:02,812 --> 01:33:06,908
But your friend Antonio, he needs you now.

1507
01:33:08,418 --> 01:33:11,410
'Cause he don't have anybody to tell him what I just told you.

1508
01:33:35,077 --> 01:33:36,169
Oome here.

1509
01:33:39,048 --> 01:33:41,539
(guard) Okay, enough.

1510
01:33:51,194 --> 01:33:53,219
Thank you for coming.

1511
01:33:54,263 --> 01:33:56,356
I know I'm in the middle of no place, right?

1512
01:33:56,432 --> 01:34:00,334
No, no. L... I should've come, you know, a long time go.

1513
01:34:00,403 --> 01:34:02,234
It's alright.

1514
01:34:10,313 --> 01:34:12,042
Damn, Dito.

1515
01:34:15,485 --> 01:34:17,646
I got so much I wanna say to you.

1516
01:34:21,858 --> 01:34:23,883
I just don't know what to say.

1517
01:34:44,514 --> 01:34:47,039
(Dito) I don't know what I was expecting to happen.

1518
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,454
Antonio exists.

1519
01:34:53,523 --> 01:34:54,990
Crazy, huh?

1520
01:34:57,293 --> 01:35:00,194
I n the end, just like I said,

1521
01:35:01,230 --> 01:35:04,028
I left everything and everyone,

1522
01:35:05,468 --> 01:35:07,060
but no one.

1523
01:35:07,837 --> 01:35:11,170
No one has ever left me.

1524
01:39:19,355 --> 01:39:21,380
Poor Antonio.

1525
01:39:23,092 --> 01:39:24,855
He's in for life.

1526
01:39:26,595 --> 01:39:29,291
(interviewer) Maybe he'll get out.

1527
01:39:30,466 --> 01:39:33,458
Yeah, but he's got a bad temper.

1528
01:39:35,337 --> 01:39:38,101
With a bad temper you can't be out of here.

1529
01:39:39,408 --> 01:39:42,138
He's a good guy, though. He's a good guy, though.

1530
01:39:42,211 --> 01:39:43,974
Oh, yeah. I like him.

1531
01:39:47,082 --> 01:39:49,880
But good guys don't get out of here.

1532
01:39:52,755 --> 01:39:56,555
They won't change. Not to worry, you know.
