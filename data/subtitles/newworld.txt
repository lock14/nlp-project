Mr. CHOI...



we're approaching the end.



No...listen...it wasn't me...



Ja-sung, please! I'm not a rat!



Think about it, how many years have I served the Chairman?



Why would I betray him and snitch for the feds?



Ja-sung!



Gonna be a rat till the end, huh?



Ja-sung, please...



Please!



No, please!



It's done, boss.



Let's go.



Yes, sir.

< NEW WORLD >



The prosecution has dropped charges of
embezzlement, stock price manipulation,



and tax evasion against Goldmoon's chairman SEOK...



This non-indictment concludes
a year-long investigation.



The prosecution justified
their decision based on information



provided by SEOK and a
lack of sufficient evidence.



The police, on the other hand,
are outraged by the ruling,



and accused the prosecution of being too lenient
on a high profile felon.



In other news, car ferries will connect
lncheon and Shanghai...



The lncheon Port Authority has issued Goldmoon



a marine passenger transportation permit...



Any word on the Shanghai boss?



He'll arrive on the first flight tomorrow.



The fuck? You guys didn't have to do this!



The great Mr. LEE himself came out to greet me!



Enough, let's just go.



Hey, bro, what's with the sour puss?
We're brothers reunited. Aren't you excited?



You've been gone a couple days,
we don't have time for this shit.



At least pretend you're happy to see me!



Hey, Suk-mu, come here ya shitbag,



Take a hit for your boss.



Get me some fucking roses or
something, motherfucker.



Hey! You're no fun! Come on, wait up.



Yo, bro!



You little prick!



Come on, let's go.



See, you gotta keep quality like this clean.



It's a brand name for a reason, you know?



How do I look? Am I sexy?
Do I look important?



This fucking guy...



How's the old man?



It might be today or tomorrow,
the doctors can't say for sure.



Goddammit, at least he'll die happy.



What was he thinking getting his dick wet so late?



He got what he deserved
for never sharing those dick pills.



At least it's unlikely that
someone put a hit on him.



Sweet.



Brand name really adds class, I can't see shit!



Oh, wait, hold on...



Hey, where'd the bag go?



Oh, here it is.



Here, a gift.



What is it?



I picked it up when I bought mine, for your wife.



With the baby and all.



- Another knock-off?
- Knock-off? You ungrateful...



It's got a certificate of authenticity!  Look!



Forget it, give it to your wife.



Stop buying stupid crap like this!



Is it that obvious?



These too?



Those are not as bad.



You motherfucker! He says it's obvious!



You said it looked legit! You lying sack of shit!



Get some new eyeballs!



He's younger than you, right?
Give him a smack, come on!



Come on, hit him!  Like you mean it!
"You motherfucker!"



Harder!  Harder, you pansy!



I'm sorry, boss...



Mr. SEOK was pronounced dead...



What?!



Who's dead?!



- Say what?!
- Boss!



- Boss!
- Who's dead?!



- Please calm down.
- Let go of me!



What do we pay you for?
Hack!  Do your job!



- Please stop, sir!
- Let go of me, you fuckers!



Who's in charge? Get him down here!



Goldmoon Corruption Investigation Report



I cross-referenced the data.



Yes, they're the same.



Thank you for coming, thank you.



Thank you, this way please.



God fucking dammit!



Don't those fucks know when to lay off?



How many cars are they bringing?



Man, it's hot.



What the fuck?!



Look at these chumps.



Who gave you permission to take our pictures?



You're violating our privacy. You know that?



You're obviously not here to pay your respects.
Who are you?  Where'd you come from?



Cat got your tongue?



- Boys.
- Yes, boss.



Make sure to remember their faces.



We might bump into them later.



Yes, sir!



Get your cameras out.



Smile for the camera, bitches!



Why exactly are you hounding us?



You stalking us? You creppy sons of bitches.



Think of that stalking line yourself?



Hey you pricks, you think you're hot shit?



We're just checking up on our favorite hooligans.



This is busted, what do have to say about that?



So this is your doing, Lieutenant KANG?



Our last go-around wasn't painful enough?



So what brought you and your lackeys over here?



Are you fucking deaf?
I told you we're here to work,



checking up on criminals and whatnot.



Don't worry about us, go bury the old man.



Motherfuck...



How can we, when you're sitting out here?



I'm not blind.



Should I make you then?



That mouth of yours is a dirty as the day I met you.



You better watch yourself.



Someone might clean it out for you one day.



- Wanna make bet?
- What?



Whose head will roll first, yours or mine.



What the fuck?!



Pricks.



Hey, there's plenty of space
around the old man's grave.



Motherfuckers.



This is a new camera.



The ink on the receipt isn't even dry yet.



Buy yourself some smokes with the change.



By the way, I got a promotion!



I'm a section chief now. Don't forget!



Fucking pigs...



Since you know we're here,
it's only polite to bring us some grub.



I saw some tasty shit getting carted in.



You guys using Korean beef?



You fucking idiots.



I want a written apology when we get back.



Yes, sir.



This is the late SEOK Dong-chool



As the chairman of Goldmoon,



he transformed the Jaebum gang
into a national crime syndicate.



He died in a car crash 2 weeks ago
on his way back from his mistress.



I heard about that, so?



Because of his sudden death,
his seat remains vacant.



As you know, Goldmoon is
comprised of three smaller gangs,



Jaebum, Jeil, and Northmoon, making it
the largest crime organization in Korea.



Under SEOK, they've become a criminal enterprise.
Today, they own eight subsidiaries and have



essentially grown into a mid-size corporation.



We may never be able to contain them again,



if we do not take action now.



Get to the point.



We'll influence the succession.



Who are the candidates?



JUNG Chung, Goldmoon's executive director.



He's in charge of construction,
and has close ties with the Triads.



He's a Chinese descendant
and former head of Northmoon



until he joined forces with SEOK.



Since he handles Goldmoon's main business,



he's the heir apparent even though
he's officially third in line.



- Any opposition?
- LEE Joong-gu.



Goldmoon's managing director and 4th in line.



He handles private loans, pyramids
and entertainment businesses,



he was Jaebum's #2 under SEOK,
but JUNG Chung pushed him down.



This has caused tension between the two.



Still, he's backed by the original Jaebum clan,
which still holds the most power.



So it's between these two?



Well, the #2 spot is officially held by JANG Su-ki,



but it's strictly a formality as he's
not involved in day-to-day operations.



Are you certain you have a chance?



What if it all fails?



It'll only cost their lives.



Don't be so casual about death...



Alright, you have my blessing.



- But I don't know anything.
- Of course, sir.



What are we calling this operation?



New World, sir.  Project New World.



Dammit, there's nowhere to go.



You haven't improved much in 6 years.



You know me, I hate headaches.



At least try to make the most of it.



For what?



All this will be over soon.



There's a succession board meeting in two days,



all the regional bosses will attend it.



Their profiles are in the report.



Okay, I'll check it out.



By the way, this won't...



affect me or change our deal, right?



Actually...



I got a new order for you today.



Have you lost it?



You've got a handler for a reason.



Might as well run outside and wave your badge.



What's the meaning of this?
What the hell's going on?



You said I'm done when SEOK's taken care of!



- The situation's changed...
- 'Situation'?!



Is it my fault he wasn't prosecuted?
Or that he's dead?



Whose idea was this?



What dumb fuck came up with it?



There's only three people in the world
who know about you.



Was it you or Director KO?



Watch your tone, you fuck.



Am I your buddy?



I guess it's to be expected after a decade with them,



you really sound like the real thing.



I can't do this anymore.



You made a promise.



You can't?



I can't, sir.



Fine, then don't.



Quit.



You're good at being a gangster.



Give it up and be a gangster for real.



Wouldn't that be better?



A cop's salary is rat shit.



What do you make?  A shit ton, right?



- Are you fucking serious?
- Oh wait...



What if they found out you were a cop?
What a pickle...



Is this fun to you? Are you fucking with me?



Look at you, Mr. Gangster.



Let go.



Ungrateful prick.



Look at the bright side,



it'll only be a couple more weeks.



After 8 years, this is nothing.



Just until the successor is chosen.



Keep supporting your buddy JUNG,
it's no big deal.



Once this is done,
I'll send you overseas as promised.



After this, they'll double your pay.



You'll practically be set for life.



Take this with you.



I picked out a mobile and some toys.



I heard it's a boy.



How did you know that?



You've got a mark on me?



Don't get paranoid,
we're just protecting our asset.



You're our most prized investment.



Fuck...



It's not safe to delay the succession.



We'd prefer to start ASAP.



No organization can maintain stability
when the head's been chopped off.



This is a business.
And if we don't act like a business,



people will start to get funny ideas.



It could get ugly real fast.



Then let's call a board meeting
this month and vote.



Any thoughts?



No problems here, I agree with you all.



What about you?



There's no reason to object.



It's not good to keep that seat empty too long.



Okay, it's settled then,



we'll call a board meeting next week
and appoint a successor.



If there's nothing else, I'll head out.



I've got business to attend to.



Yo.



Since we're all here, let's grab a bite to eat.



Forget it.



I got no time for bullshit pleasantries
over a meal,



especially with you.



I'd rather choke to death.



Shit, those are some choice words.



I'm off then.



what an asshole...



Senile old fucks, rolling their eyes and shit.



Dickless bastards.



Oh yeah, bro, I have a big favor to ask you.



I'm not interested.



You cold bastard.



I have to get back to Shanghai.
Day after tomorrow.



Couldn't finish the deal
because the old man got himself killed.



It'll only take a few days,
look after my seat for me.



Alright.



Fuck, you scared me, lighten up.



Wipe that mug off, little bitch.



If Joong-gu knew I left my nest empty,
he might stir shit up,



so keep it to yourself.



He's not a little kid,
he won't do anything.



There're too many eyes right now.



That fucker is an adult-sized baby.



Where's the car? Didn't I tell you to park close?!



What the fuck?



Did I startle you?



You scared?



Look, this isn't funny!



Oh, I'm sorry.



You piece of shit, drive properly!



Our colleagues almost heart attacks.



My apologies, boss.



How the fuck did you get a license?



I thought you had important business.
Why are you fucking around here?



Forgot the way out? Need directions?



You need to work on your sense of humor.



Stay safe, you hear?



Take care.



See that? You see what I mean?



That prick won't change until he's buried.



Shit, I think I peed a little.



Yo, bro!



That was some smooth shit!



Damn, my heart's pounding!



Let's go get some pussy! No, let's get
shit-faced, then get some pussy!



I'm fine, you go ahead.



- Shit!
- Go on.



Look, I don't enjoy fucking those bitches,
I just wanna calm my nerves.



- In-and-out, in-and-out!
- Go on, drive.



Come on, hop in.



I really can't today.



Let's go!



Follow us.



Yo, bro, something on your mind?



You look like shit.



I'm just...tired.



We got important shit coming up,
you need to shape up.



I'll get you some meds from China.



I thought your face couldn't
get any uglier, but I guess not.



Hello?



I don't need a loan, I've got plenty of money.



It's a real worry of mine,



if your kid gets your face, he's fucked.



We have to play the hand we're dealt,



it'll all work out for the best.



You just follow my lead, we're brothers.



Oh, now you're laughing.



My fellow Chinks! Fill your glasses!



Raise your glasses!
Let's drink to Ja-sung's kid!



Let's all pray, that it takes after his wife!



You speak the truth!



- Cheers!
- Cheers!



- Lemme pour for you.
- Yes, sir!



Sit down, asswipe.



Will you stop harassing my plant?



They can feel too.



How are the other clans reacting?



Them? They're busy figuring out who to side with.



Of course, this will determine
whether they live or die.



How's Ja-sung?



Heard he's got a kid on the way.



How's he coping?



Not well.  Would you?



But what can he do?



He has no say.



Keep a tight leash on him,



after all this work, we can't affor-



I know, I know.



The plan's good.



Alright, proceed with the plan,



don't mess this up.



My boss...



No...



JUNG Chung's file on LEE Joong-gu
has been uploaded.



But it won't be enough to charge him.



It should be enough. We'll take care of it.



Who's the other mole?



Is he a cop too?



Or intelligence?



I'm not in the loop either.



What's this "grand plan" you guys cooked up?



There must be one by now.



Can't even tell me that?
"Shut up, and do what you're told?"



What am I to you all?



Those scumbags trust me,
why can't you?



I follow all your orders!  Why?



- As per protocol...
- Fuck that!



Fuck your protocols...



My neck is on the line here.



I'm a cop too,
we're on the same side, right?



JUNG's flying out tomorrow afternoon.



Check the itinerary.



Nice shot.



- Indeed.
- Great form.



Do any of you hit the green nowadays?



I used to, but not so much these days.



You know how...sensitive...things are now...



With the chairman's passing and everything.



Goddammit.



Was that for me to hear?



No, no, of course not!



Why would we pick a fight with you? Of course not.



We're a family, no need to get all worked up.



Family? So how do you explain your recent behavior?



Abandoning one of your own and kissing JUNG's ass.



Was it you?



Or you?



Who was it?



Joong-gu, listen to me...



You got it all wrong.
We would never do that.



We just accepted him
because the Chairman adored him.



- We take care of our own.
- That's right.



That Chink bastard is not one of us.



Right, right.



So next week's pissing contest is pointless then.



JANG won't side with anyone,



and JUNG's clan doesn't have enough sway



to overcome this family, isn't that right?



That's right.



Everyone knows we got your back.



That's the truth!



- But...
- What's in it for you?



Of course.



You get to keep your heads.



Was the Chairman's death really an accident?



I feel terrible about leaving like this.



Will you stop it? It's like we're going out.



It's just because I feel really bad!



Why don't you just stay then?



Again with the cold shoulder?
Fine, I'll stop, you asshole.



In any case, just make sure...



Okay, okay, I'll stop, damn!



- Alright, alright, already!
- Okay, okay!



I'll buy you real shit this time,
you'll flip your lid.



Will you just go?
It's like you're being shipped to war!



Seriously, what's with you?



What's with the attitude lately?
I am off to war, you fuckhead!



Good afternoon.



Have a safe trip!



What?  You got beef with me?



Come with us, you'll find out.



I'm his lawyer.



What's this about? Go through me first.



What's he saying?



Come with us quietly.



Sure.



But if I miss this flight,
you're paying for my ticket.



Don't worry about that.



We fly first class.



National Police Agency Chief KANG Hyung-chul



Listen, I've been really busy with work,



so why have the cops carted me off?



It's because of that work of yours.



Goldmoon Corruption Investigation Report



This is some pretty serious shit.



Make a decision.
There's still time before your flight.



I'm gonna have a smoke if that's okay.



So if you want to take out Joong-gu,



that means you'll back me, right?



Right, As you know, you've got
no chance against him.



Thanks for the shot of confidence,



but we're not schoolyard bullies.



And we're not mall cops.



- You're underestimating us.
- Your words, not mine.



Are you really asking
for me to snitch on him?



We don't always see eye to eye,
but this is pretty low.



Read this on your flight.



These look like our soldiers.



Shit, I thought we smoked out all the moles.



Looks like there's some more left.



Let's get one thing straight.



You accused SEOK's men as moles
and eliminated them.



And SEOK was a necessary casualty
on your way to the throne.



Right?



Think whatever you want.



If you have this much dirt,
what's stopping you?



It's for everyone's good.



We're asking for consent
before the shit hits the fan.



Consent? More like a notice.



Enough for today, you're late for your flight.



By the way, how did you know
I was flying out today?



Perfect timing, too.



Now it all makes sense.



You've got plenty of rats inside.



Must be nice.



Look him up for me.



Any dirt you can find.
Police records, personal details, anything.



Money is no object.



Get the best people on it.



I know just the guy.



And...



Call the Yanbian hobos.



Will you handle this yourself?



Fucker...



So he wants to play?



Yeah, are you on Joong-gu?



Good boy.



We're moving in first thing tomorrow,
so get some muscle.



Okay.



How's that old geezer JANG?



What can that feeble chump do?
He just leads a lonely life.



Aside from other geezers
dropping by for tea, nothing, boss.



Drinking tea like they got class?



Stay on those senile pricks
until the board meeting.



Those dickless fucks can't be trusted.



- Don't worry, boss.
- Yes, boss.



If one of them tries to step out of the line...



I'll chop their balls off
and feed them to their kids.



Hey, fucker!  You're real scary!



You never learned the art of subtlety, did you?
You dangerous fuck!



"Chop their balls off," listen to this guy.



By the way, boss, what about JUNG Chung?



When you take the chair, he'll dust up a storm.



Enough business...
Let's enjoy this meal. Come on, eat.



The veal here is so tender,
you can tell the beef's Korean.



Yes, boss.



- Who the fuck are you?
- Grab him.



Who let them in?



It's alright, sit, sit.



Who the hell are you?



Why are you ruining
a perfectly good breakfast?



Can't you see we're eating?



Looks like you're almost done.



Well, I'll be damned, it's Lieutenant...



Right, you got promoted.



Chief KANG, our paths cross too much.



You piece of shit.



I'm getting tired of your mouth.



This restaurant is a bit out of your league.



Your salary wouldn't even cover the dessert.



Look at this...



How can you eat this in the morning?



Know your place in life.



Chief KANG...



It's long, bear with me.



LEE Joong-gu, you're charged with
murder, fraud, assault, extortion,



and... blah, blah, blah.



There's quite a bit.



It's little too early for half-assed jokes.



I'm not really one for jokes.



Are you really up for this?



Think you can take me on?



The charges won't stick.



This is a court-certified warrant,



We won't disappoint you this time.



Take him away.



- Boss!
- Boss!



Who was it? Was it that fucker JUNG?



I wonder...



Who could it be?



- Boss, no!
- Sir!



Call a meeting.



Okay, and I'll book the flight back.



Is the file on chief KANG not ready yet?



I made sure to have it for you when we arrive.



And the hobos?



They should've arrived by now.



lncheon International Ferry Terminal



Try not to look like hicks.



Don't make it obvious that we're from Yanbian.



We don't need the extra attention.



- You hear?
- Okay.



Let's get going!



You see?!



The Koreans sense these things!



They already know we're from China!



Let's go!



This is the face, fingers, and toes.



Hear that heartbeat? He's healthy.



You'll feel the baby kicking from now on.



You'll gain weight noticeably and...



Honey, should we...



move away?



Hello?



I haven't received a report in weeks.



There was nothing special.



'Nothing special'?



What made the other times so special?



When does he get home?
What he eats, how much he eats.



Does he snore or not? Simple stuff.



I told you no detail is too small to leave out.



Is your baby making you soft?



Don't you talk about my child!



I want to quit.



Quit?



The deal was cooperation in exchange
for your dope fiend father.



We dragged you out of that bar
and cleaned you up.



shouldn't I be hearing thanks for your life?



That degenerate is dead,
and Ja-sung was the one who saved me.



Don't you worry, I'll live for him.



Is that so?



You think you can get what you want?



How would your man feel if he knew you were spying on him?



That thug would love to hear that, wouldn't he?



You son of a bitch!



You're right...but what can I do?  This is my job.



Do yours, got it?



The cops really went all out this time.



Maybe they really dug up enough dirt to prosecute.



Is that so?



I wonder...who could have give them the dirt?



Why are you looking at me like that?



I wouldn't stoop that low.



And I never had that kind of dirt to begin with.



Yeah? Then who could it be?



If it's not you, then it's probably one of yours.



Your boy Ja-sung perhaps?



Fucking traitor, this is how you do me?



Keep me busy so you can take over
the entire organization?



- Yo, Joong-gu...
- Motherfucker!



I'll fucking split your mouth!



I'll fucking split your mouth open
if you ever say my name again.



Try me.



Come at me all you want.



Let's see if you get your way.



Our lawyer's doing his best,



so sit tight for a bit longer.



We've greased enough of them over the years,



it'll all work out.



Did you...



off the old man?



It wasn't you?



If it wasn't you, it was prolly a rat, or...



Or?



Or a thousand others.



Here's one for you, you fucking Chink.



Yo, JUNG.



Please...



Watch your back.



Even behind bars you're thinking of me.



I'm truly grateful!



You're really something...



Bring it here.



A small token of my appreciation.



What is it?  Something edible?



It's Chinese mooncake, a real delicacy.
I'm sure you'll like it.



Mooncake, huh?



Come on, don't eat it here...



How do you eat it? Like this?



This doesn't look edible...



It's laundered clean, there's no need to worry.



I'll take good care of you.



We'll send you a regular care package.



Consider it your retirement fund.



You just have to back off and let us do our thing.



You're getting too big for your britches.



- Give me a smoke.
- Yes, boss.



What, you don't like cake? Need more?



Do you want a share of our earnings then?



Hey JUNG Chung,



what do you take me for?



Take it back.



I don't take money from gangsters.



Then what do you want?



You're not trying to wipe us out,
so you must want something.



Wipe you out?



Someone else will take your place in no time.



Start a new investigation? Gives me a headache.



We're not asking much from you.



Just know your place and do as you're told.



No need to overreact to everything.



So you want us to run errands for you pigs?



Like fucking dickless lapdogs?



There's no need for that.



Think of it as,



a cooperative relationship.



- Grab the cash.
- Yes, sir.



Alright, enough, piss off!



Okay, I hear you.



I got your message loud and clear.



You'll hear from me soon.



It's chief KANG's personnel file,



both professional and personal.



Shut up!



Is this accurate?



I got it from somee of
China's best hackers.



These guys could infiltrate
the FBI database in 2 days, tops.



And the hobos?



They're waiting for your order.



Incoming call - Bro



My fucking bro! Where you at?



When did you get in? Today?



Why didn't you call?



Of course, it's not a problem.



Oh, a "surprise?"  Really?



Why there?



Okay.



Wasn't he due back in 2 days?



This isn't not like him.



To the lncheon warehouse.



Yes, boss.



Pull over for a bit.



What would you like to do?



Call the hobos.



I think my cover is blown.



Wipe my file and clean this place.



And please quit smoking, sir.



Take care.



She killed the lights?



Holy shit! You never said she had a gun!



I wasn't told either, fuckwad!



We still gotta keep her alive?



- Yeah, that's the order.
- Let's hang back.



It's a six-shooter, she's got 3 bullets left.



Hey retard! This isn't Yanbian!



Didn't you hear the gunshots?!
The cops will be all over this shit!



Then what do we do?



Let's just rush her!



Isn't that dangerous?



Are we on a vacation?



Let's move!



He's waiting inside, sir.



Why'd you drag me all the way over here?



You're here!  A bit late though.



Yeah, the rain caused some traffic.



Suk-mu, you fuck.



I told you to switch to GPS.



You get realtime traffic info, motherfucker.



That's how we got here, right?



Bring it over.



Come!



Yo, bro.



Wanna see what's inside that barrel?



Give me a smoke.



Tada!



It's your Go teacher.



Surprised?



Shame...pretty cute, and a fuckable body too.



Those juicy tits...



Yo, bro.



Did you know?



That cunt is a rat.



A cop.



A fucking cop.



Did you know that?



No, I...



I didn't.



She's a strong one, that bitch.



She wouldn't give us shit.



Better than my boys, I'll give her that.



But I already knew what I wanted to know,



I just figured I'd just double check.



This right here.



I paid a fortune for this file.



Check it out.



Even I was shocked!



Not just a mole, but a cop was part of our family!



Go on...look!



That cum stain beside her is Chief KANG.



He's the one barking up our asses.



He was an instructor when she was at the Academy.



So he was her mentor or some shit.



Probably popped her cherry!



Flip the page.



There's one more.



That one...



really got to me.



Son of a bitch!



Motherfucker!



Yo, bro!



Surprised?



These fuck-holes were playing you all this time!



Piece of shit's not cutting through!



Chief KANG'll get the message, don't you think?



- Yo Yanbians!
- Yeah?



Have some fun, then toss her with the body.



Alright.



Let's go.



When I'm through with you,
you'll beg for death.



What? A booty call at this hour?



You're violating my right to sleep.



Got some news that'll wake you right up.



This better be good.



A new board meeting has been called.



In 2 days, 5 pm.



JUNG'll take the helm since you're in here.



So, you're here to rub it in?



Yeah, you useless piece of shit.



What?  Say that agai-



So useless that you lost everything to the Chinks.



Since when did the Chinks take over Goldmoon?



Didn't it belong to your clan?



You were the rightful heir.



I didn't know you cared so deeply for me.



And who got me into this?



If it weren't for you,
this wouldn't have happened.



Boy, we're cops.



We get a report, we investigate,
we find dirt, we arrest.



That's our job.



So who made that report?



JUNG Chung, you've hit rock bottom.



So what?!



What do you want me to do? Make a shiv?



This is the best you can do?!



I'm LEE Joong-gu! The almighty LEE Joong-gu!



JUNG Chung, that cocksucker.



This is rat poison, no doubt about it.



Sir?



But I can't just let it pass.



I can't fall alone.



This could be
a blessing in disguise.



Alright, I'll play along.



I'll play.



How did JUNG find out?



Did you make a deal with him?



I know I'm a lowlife,



but not that low.



I figured it was you.



I thought you flipped.



We had a case like that...



A long time ago.



Is that why you had Suk-mu on me?
As an insurance?



We put him there, but he didn't know about you.



Son of a bitch.



Don't be like that, it's almost over.



There's nothing more to lose.



Nothing's changed,



we continue according to the plan.



So what's the plan?



The plan?!



Who will you back between them?



What?!



JANG Su-ki, current vice chair of Goldmoon.



You said he holds no power.



He was the Jeil boss, but lost all power



when the clans united as Goldmoon.



At the time, Jeil was about to disband,



so he's semi-retired.



He's perfect.



We took care of him since
the beginning so he's ready to go,



but he's so powerless that
our help alone won't do.



That's why he needs a capable running mate.



A running mate?



This is Goldmoon's COO LEE Ja-sung.



He's from the same town as JUNG,



and also a Chinese descendant.



Will he follow through?



He may have to betray JUNG later.



I always wondered who my running mate was.



With you by my side, this may be a doable.



Ja-sung, let's go all the way.



Son of a bitch!



You two haven't worked it all out yet?



Ja-sung, let's talk details later.



What the fuck is this?!



Use him to take over Goldmoon.



You said this is the end,



you said this was my last mission.



Sir, I can't do this.



You promised, you gave me your word!



Don't you care what happens to me?



Do I matter at all?



There's no other choice.



This is the safest path for you.



You son of a bitch! Cut the bullshit!



How do you think JUNG Chung found out?



Our database was hacked last week.



By Chinese hackers.



They targeted me, stole top secret intel.



They found Suk-mu here too!



They got everything.



And your file was definitely included.



How come you won't kill Ja-sung?



Go over the Shanghai contract.



I wiped all your files.



Officer LEE Ja-sung does not exist.



Only me and the director know about you.



No one knows why JUNG decided to keep you,



but it's a lucky break.



It gave us the upper hand.



JUNG Chung's finished, as of today.



LEE's clan is on the move.



Got a smoke?



What the?



Shit!



Get him!



Motherfuckers!



Boss, you have to go!



Let go of me, assholes!



Kill 'em all!



Motherfuckers!



Send them to hell!



Hold them back!



Stop them!



You spineless fucks...



Did Joong-gu order the hit?



Falling for the cops' tricks?



You underestimated our clan,
you backstabbing Chink!



Come at me, motherfuckers! Come at me!



Do it!



Move, move, move!



Over here, asshole!



Joong-gu, that fucker finally
stirred up a shitstorm.



He dragged everyone into this mess.



His clan and the Jaebum clan are finished.



There's no other way around this now.



Someone must step up and clean up this mess.



Isn't that right, vice chair JANG?



We tried our best, but he won't make it.



I'm sorry.



What do we do, boss?



- Where's HAN Joo-kyung?
- She's...



She's in recovery.



I'm sorry about the baby.



High levels of stress
and sudden shock triggered this.



It would have been dangerous for her too.



Now, Ja-sung just has to take over.



He's a made man now.



Shouldn't he thank us for this?



When this is done, process my resignation.



Are you drunk? Not that shit again.



Who'll manage this operation if you leave?



You made this case, this is your baby.



I can't do this,
I'm too dumb for this shit.



Stupidity is your excuse? Fucking moron.



You can't back out of this.



No one can back out of this.



Either we see it through, or die in the process,



There's no turning back.



It's a goddamn shame.
We lost a few of our own.



But sacrifices are needed to win a war.



Can you keep him under control?



It won't be so easy anymore.



What can he do? He's a fish caught in our net.



No, thanks.



I quit.



Who knew the passing of SEOK
would be such a blessing!



Indeed!



Now that it's all behind us,



SEOK, and his boys LEE and JUNG,
were way too uptight.



It's a brand new era.



Will JUNG's boys stay in line?



They still got Ja-sung.



Your worries are unfounded.



I assure you, they won't act recklessly.



I promised him the vice chair
once I get the position.



That's a brilliant idea!



Succeeding in accordance
to the rank is the right thing.



- This is great!
- Very good!



As a precaution, I brought my own men.



Just enough muscle for a smooth transition.



Don't worry, I know where I stand.



What can I do with a few men?



Think of them as my entourage.



Let's finish this drink hit the range!



I should be ashamed!



Asking Goldmoon's vice chair
to my shabby hut.



What do you want?



What do I want?



Remember you're at my beck and call.



Until another handler is assigned,
you report directly to me.



I'm warning you, nothing's changed.



You're a cop, don't forget that.



And submit a revised organization chart
by next week.



Emphasize new intel that
you didn't have access to before.



Got it?



Especially the top brass, feds,
and other suits on Goldmoon's payroll.



One more thing,



LEE will be released soon.



What?



Insufficient evidence.



Let me be clear, don't touch him.



I'm sorry about your baby.



I mean it.



Yeah.



What?



It doesn't look good.



You should make necessary arrangements.



Leave us.



Let's go.



Loosen up, you fuck.



I'm not dead yet.



Didn't think I'd see you again.



It's good to see you.



Yo, bro.



You look like shit.



It's time...



to choose a side.



Listen to me, asshole.



You'll stay alive that way.



What are you doing?



Boss...



Bro!



You fucking idiot...



What if...



like a fucking miracle...



I pull through?



You think you could take me on?



I left you a present in my office safe.



Check it out later.



Be strong,



My brother.



That's the only way for you to survive.



Go away, I'm tired.



I'll be damned...



How the almighty has fallen.



Yes boss, he just got out.



Ride with me, I want a word with you.



Beautiful day, isn't it?



He's a terrible driver.



If you were me, wouldn't you do the same?



KANG won't let this slide.



What can he do?



With you gone, he can only depend on me.



Shall we? Let's get some air.



Take care, send my regards to JUNG Chung.



Give me a smoke if you got one.



One last smoke isn't much to ask for, right?



Today's the board meeting?



Congratulate Ja-sung for me.
Who knew he'd sit on the throne?



Rags to riches, indeed...



What a beautiful day to die!



How dare you?!



If that's the decision you made...



Hey, mister, you have cash to pay me, right?



Dammit!



Alright, alright, don't touch!



Which car? That one?



Attention please.



Our current Vice Chair and
unanimous successor JANG Su-ki



has decided to forfeit his candidacy
for personal reasons.



And LEE Ja-sung has been nominated for the chair.



Any objections?



This is an expensive car, it's not for your-



Mister, pull up right beside it.



Wait, what?



Are you deaf? Beside that car.



Okay...



Chairman LEE Ja-sung



What was your name?



LEE Ja-sung, sir.



LEE Ja-sung...



Born in Yeosu...



Chinese descendant, right?



Yes, sir.



I got a job for you, one that's tailored for you.



Sir?



6 years ago, Yeosu



Come on, hurry up!



Fuck you, I gotta piss when I get nervous.



You drank like a whore.



- Be right back.
- Godammit!



Shit, I got it on my pants.



- Any plans later?
- Why do you care?



The fuck do you want?



Let's go, there's a lot of them.



Who the fuck?!



I'll fucking kill you!



Gimme a smoke.



Let's wash up and see a movie.



Which one?



Porn, of course.



Fuck...



Let's go.
