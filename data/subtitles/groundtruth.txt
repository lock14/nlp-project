1
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,973
Today we bring together...

2
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,232
...another fine group, another
generation of men and women...

3
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,471
...into the ranks
of our armed forces.

4
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:22,877
Please raise your right hand
and repeat after me.

5
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:26,446
I do solemnly swear...
INDUCTEES: I do solemnly swear...

6
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,487
...that I will support
and defend...

7
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,318
...that I will support
and defend...

8
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,790
...the Constitution
of the United States...

9
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,850
...the Constitution
of the United States...

10
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,091
...against all enemies...
...against all enemies...

11
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:41,065
...foreign and domestic.
...foreign and domestic.

12
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,500
So help me, God.
So help me, God.

13
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,901
Congratulations.

14
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:49,098
Let's hear it for
these fine young gentlemen.

15
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:53,368
New recruits
of the armed forces.

16
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,873
ROBERT ACOSTA: I live here
in Santa Ana, like...

17
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,474
...you know, I'm not going nowhere.
I'm not gonna do nothing.

18
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,781
You know, my friends
are getting locked up.

19
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,252
So it's just like,
what's the point?

20
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,790
I mean, what's the point
of staying here?

21
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,951
You might as well just leave,
and then they start...

22
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:08,721
I talked to a recruiter,
and he starts telling me...

23
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,787
"Okay, you could go here, and you could
go there, and you could do this and that."

24
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,799
So it sounded good.
It did. It sounded good.

25
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,893
I'd been encouraged to talk to a
recruiter for the National Guard...

26
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,599
...and so I thought that
it would be a good way...

27
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,664
...to get money for school...

28
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:27,076
...and also learn medical, some medical
skills. And I went in as a medic.

29
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,207
I didn't join the active duty.
I joined the National Guard...

30
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,843
...and my recruiter told me
I would be stateside.

31
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,685
He said, " National Guard
doesn't get deployed.

32
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,545
"You'll receive
the college benefits.

33
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:41,321
"The only thing that will happen is if
there's ever a riot or anything like that...

34
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,692
"you will be deployed
for that."

35
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,197
But he was like, "Other than
that, you won't get sent overseas."

36
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,064
I grew up in a family where my
father was drafted during Vietnam...

37
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,103
...my grandfather was drafted
during World War II

38
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,968
...and spent three years
in the South Pacific.

39
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,473
And they hated the military,
in large part...

40
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,271
...but they got a lot
out of their experiences.

41
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,312
So I felt like I had an
obligation to give something back.

42
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,541
Because I didn't have to go,
it didn't mean I shouldn't go.

43
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,116
MELISSA STOCKWELL:
Freshman year of college...

44
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,618
I would see them around campus
and I kind of thought...

45
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,483
...it's something I wanted to do.

46
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:12,514
I absolutely love our country. I think
it's the greatest place in the world.

47
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,987
And so sophomore year
I signed up.

48
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:20,098
I saw Top Gun when I was in
eighth grade and I just, I knew.

49
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,294
I knew what I wanted to do.
I knew what I wanted to be.

50
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:28,338
And then I saw Marine when I was in
high school and I was like, "That's it."

51
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:32,800
They're mean, they're tough. They
got cool uniforms and chicks dig them.

52
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,704
MALE NARRATOR: Ever wondered what
it's really like to be a soldier?

53
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,545
What do you got? I've received
word from Alpha Company.

54
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,778
DT ready to be verified.
Verify.

55
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,886
MALE NARRATOR: Put yourself in
the picture with this free video.

56
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:47,450
You'll see over 200 great jobs in the
Army and over 180 in the Army Reserve.

57
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,496
You'll also see what skills you'll
learn, how you can earn money for college...

58
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,497
...even what soldiers do
in their free time.

59
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,930
Put yourself in the picture...

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,434
...and see what it's really like
to become an army of one.

61
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,564
When you advertise cigarettes...

62
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,403
...you see that little Surgeon
General on the side, right?

63
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,439
But they used to advertise
cigarettes where it used to be cool.

64
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:09,208
You used to see the
billboards, it used to be cool.

65
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:12,217
They advertised cigarettes
on being cool.

66
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,743
Now you got the military.

67
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,655
You don't see
no Surgeon General sign on it...

68
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:21,854
...that you might die from
bomb shrapnel or whatever.

69
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,657
That we might go to war
and lose a limb.

70
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:27,455
You don't see that. They advertise
the military as being a man.

71
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,229
"Fight for value.
This is great for you."

72
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,834
They don't tell you the
consequences. You understand?

73
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:35,667
AIDAN DELGADO:
I was one of those people...

74
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,643
...who didn't think about the full picture
of what being in military service...

75
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,770
Because recruiters
and Army people...

76
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:44,047
...they soft-pedal all of the
objectionable parts of the military.

77
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,584
I mean, you never hear
recruiters say, like...

78
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,052
"Oh, well, you may get
a chance to shoot prisoners."

79
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,646
Or, " You may get a chance
to abuse Iraqi civilians."

80
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,055
Or, " You may get a chance to
see your friends getting killed."

81
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,354
The killing...

82
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:57,794
...and the bloody business of the
military, they downplay that...

83
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:00,958
...because parents don't wanna hear it,
and people don't wanna think about it.

84
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:03,195
Is this for
training purposes only?

85
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,502
SOLDIER 1: And that little red button
right there, you'll press that button.

86
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:08,998
Oh.

87
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,005
SOLDIER 2: Push it.

88
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,549
The closest thing to combat...

89
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,142
...without pulling the trigger,
is Marine Corps recruiting.

90
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,622
And I'm the type of person,
I love a challenge.

91
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:28,017
The system is not designed for
the individual recruiter to excel...

92
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:33,564
...if you have ethical or moral,
you know, dilemmas in your life.

93
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,562
It's a system
designed to fraud...

94
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:40,367
...and to manipulate, lie, cheat,
beg, borrow and steal.

95
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,103
If you're willing to do that, then you'll
be successful at Marine Corps recruiting.

96
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,841
ACOSTA: They know
what they're doing.

97
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,641
They know where to go.
They know what to say.

98
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:51,081
And it's sad because it's just, like,
all these guys thinking, you know...

99
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,278
"For once in my life, I'm gonna
leave and I'm not coming back."

100
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,049
They go straight to Iraq.

101
00:05:56,522 --> 00:06:00,219
"Here's the big book of all the
opportunities we have in the Marine Corps.

102
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,885
"What do you want to do?"

103
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,156
Pushed it across the desk
at me.

104
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,994
I looked him in the eye, and I pushed
it back across the desk, you know.

105
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,694
And I said, "I wanna be a
grunt. I wanna go blow shit up.

106
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,202
"That's what I wanna do."

107
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,732
That's what I got to do.
I got to go blow shit up.

108
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,900
While you talk
about health care...

109
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:20,844
...and you talk about pay and
your benefits, and, you know...

110
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:25,077
...and all these things that are
positives, without a doubt.

111
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:28,848
Educational benefits. I mean,
all these things, they're great.

112
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,782
That's not what your purpose
is in the military.

113
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,656
I mean,
your purpose is to kill.

114
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,219
I mean, that is your primary,
especially as an infantryman.

115
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:42,927
I mean, make no mistake about it, that's
what your purpose is, is to take life.

116
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,528
Aye, sir! Aye, sir!

117
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,901
CHARLIE ANDERSON:
It starts in basic training.

118
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,411
They systemically
break you down.

119
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,804
When they bring you in...

120
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,476
...they make sure that everybody
shows up in the middle of the night.

121
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,212
They keep you up
through the night.

122
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,548
ALL: Yes, sir.

123
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,919
Your day starts at 2:30
in the morning...

124
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,049
...and that happens
for the first couple of weeks.

125
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:10,494
And actually, through basic
training we got up after 4:00 once...

126
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:13,054
...because they want
to keep you tired.

127
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,930
Because that puts everybody
on the same wavelength.

128
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:19,130
DRILL SERGEANT: You will stay
awake, you understand me? Yes, sir!

129
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:24,575
Aye, sir! Aye, sir!
Aye, sir! Aye, sir!

130
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,077
Huh?
I'm just...

131
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,375
Get the frick away from me,
you fricking turd!

132
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,416
Come here, son. How about you?

133
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,246
You already order portholes?
Yes, sir.

134
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,309
So what the fuck you coming up
here for? The screw doesn't...

135
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,649
Huh? Huh?

136
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,780
Now get up and go!
SOLDIERS: Aye, sir!

137
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,757
Get! Move!
SOLDIERS: Kill!

138
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,157
Go get them!
SOLDIERS: Yes, sir!

139
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,956
Go get them!
Yes, sir!

140
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,793
One of the most rare
discharges from the Marine Corps...

141
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,629
...is an administrative discharge
for failure to adapt.

142
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:51,067
Fricking bridge, son.
Now get a bridge.

143
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,367
Go get your fricking boot lace
and do it right.

144
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,531
RECRUIT 1: Aye, sir.

145
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:55,631
What are we doing?

146
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,176
RECRUIT 2: This recruit can't
find his left moon boot, sir.

147
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,906
RECRUIT 3: This recruit
can't find his left moon boot.

148
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,574
Well, hello, idiot!
What do you think happened?

149
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,173
It's fucking mixed up.

150
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,917
No, sir!

151
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,080
Aye, sir.
Aye, sir!

152
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,053
HUZE: The training program
is so effective...

153
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:18,462
...that the vast majority of
individuals who go through it...

154
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,294
...emerge from it as a warrior.

155
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:23,995
Harder. War cry!
Kill, kill! Say it!

156
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,598
RECRUIT: Kill.
Louder.

157
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,502
Kill!
War cry!

158
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,666
DAVID GROSSMAN: You will read
a hundred military manuals...

159
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,108
...and you'll never see
that four-letter word "kill."

160
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:36,041
You will talk to military
psychiatrists and psychologists.

161
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,240
And they will never
use the word "kill"

162
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,478
...and they do not want
to talk about killing.

163
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,782
And that is a pathology.
That is dysfunctional.

164
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:48,591
HUZE: Taking someone's life is
not something that's abnormal.

165
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,858
It's taking it when you're
not in a state of rage.

166
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,794
That's abnormal.

167
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:58,599
Being able to have
a sustained desire...

168
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,400
...is what requires training.

169
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,338
Kill, kill. Say it!

170
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:05,343
RECRUIT: Kill! Go. Go.
Go. Go.

171
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,436
I mean, every human being,
at one time or another...

172
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:10,175
...has probably had an overwhelming
urge to kill somebody.

173
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,945
You want to strangle that guy.
You're enraged.

174
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,284
You're red with rage
but you didn't kill him. Why?

175
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:21,186
Because somewhere inside the midbrain
of most healthy members of our species...

176
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,751
...is a resistance
to killing their own kind.

177
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,888
We slammed head-on into that
in World War II.

178
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:29,423
We found out the vast majority
of people wouldn't kill.

179
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:33,327
And so, by Vietnam,
we had crafted a technique...

180
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,636
...that makes killing
a conditioned reflex.

181
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,368
We're having
realistic simulations...

182
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,537
...and you take realistic
simulations of the weapon...

183
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,138
...and you shoot the target
and the target drops.

184
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:48,248
You're shooting your man-sized
target and you figure...

185
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:51,717
"Oh, it's gonna be no big deal."
And you've seen enough movies.

186
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,359
You pull the trigger,
bullet hits, they drop. Done.

187
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,722
GROSSMAN: The hardware in enabling
killing hasn't changed much.

188
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,790
The pistol, the rifle,
hasn't changed that much.

189
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:05,737
The software
has changed phenomenally.

190
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:10,242
The psychological process began
months before we entered Iraq.

191
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:13,608
And there was all sorts of, like,
chanting and songs about, you know...

192
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,113
"Kill ragheads.
Kill Osama bin Laden."

193
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:19,345
And then, like, the little targets that
would pop up for the range training...

194
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:22,854
...they call them, you know, bin
Ladens or Taliban or other...

195
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,116
...you know, ethnic things.

196
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,191
As well as the dehumanization,
you know...

197
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:30,057
...the hajis, the ragheads,
those kind of terms.

198
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,461
Bomb the village
Kill the people...

199
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:38,765
Do it Throw some napalm in the square...

200
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,035
Do it on a Sunday morning...

201
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:46,010
Kill them
on their way to prayer...

202
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,610
Ring the bell
inside the schoolhouse...

203
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,482
Watch those kiddies
gather around...

204
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,582
Lock and load with your 240

205
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,421
Mow them
little motherfuckers down...

206
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,324
I mean, it...

207
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:05,421
And if you get a whole group
of people singing this thing...

208
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,331
...it gets kind of catchy.
It's a group dynamic.

209
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,993
DRILL SERGEANT: One, two!
SOLDIERS: Kill.

210
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,060
HUZE: This is what's
instilled in you.

211
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,265
I mean, our war cry
in training, you know...

212
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,037
...like when you're approaching the target
and firing and live fire was "Kill babies."

213
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,168
SOLDIERS: Kill!
DRILL SERGEANT: Fuck!

214
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,337
SOLDIERS: Kill! Kill!

215
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,813
Songs about, you know,
going to a schoolyard...

216
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,248
...and breaking out your K-boy
and killing the kids there.

217
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:29,344
Or going to a shopping mall and, you
know, killing the women that are shopping.

218
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:32,220
I mean, these are cadence that
you sing while you're jogging.

219
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,522
DOUGHERTY: They have you do all
these different chants and cadences...

220
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:39,530
...about killing and stabbing or,
you know, and I just thought...

221
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:42,533
"Oh, my God! I can't believe
that we're saying this"

222
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:45,263
...when I first went
into basic training.

223
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:49,865
And then, as the weeks kind of went
on, you just go with it and you say it...

224
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,433
...and you don't really
think about it anymore.

225
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:55,674
'Cause it's just... They're
just words, you know. But...

226
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,482
So I think we're killers.

227
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,145
I mean, we're not killers...

228
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,018
...or we're trained killers,
but I don't know.

229
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,581
Well, am I going to be able to
do this when it comes down to it?

230
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,058
You know,
when I'm getting shot at?

231
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,687
Am I gonna flip out?
Am I gonna cry? You know.

232
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:14,062
You have no idea of how you're
gonna react until it actually comes.

233
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,631
But I wanted to know.

234
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,362
DRILL SERGEANT: Amen!
SOLDIERS: Up!

235
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:20,701
Chaplain comes out, grabs
the mike. Let us... Bitch.

236
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,236
Let us pray!
Down!

237
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,469
Amen!
Up!

238
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:29,213
HUZE: Someone, you know, or a group of
people make very well-thought-out decisions...

239
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,442
...about cadence, about training...

240
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:36,386
...so that by the time you actually need
it for real, you know, in a combat zone...

241
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:41,350
...that you don't stop
and become paralyzed with it.

242
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,923
Because then you're dead.

243
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,988
Everything is associated
around killing. Everything.

244
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,626
And I mean, sooner or later
it's gonna sink in...

245
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,136
...and after a while
you actually wanna do it.

246
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:56,641
Because, you know, you're looking forward
to go do what you've been trained for.

247
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:59,210
Well, I think
that's the difference...

248
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,473
...because you actually
start wanting to do it.

249
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,271
I mean, I did it.

250
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,748
I wanted to do it.
I wanted that experience.

251
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,809
I wanted to know
what it was like.

252
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:20,357
Somebody gotta be there
when it gets ugly...

253
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,900
Somebody gotta be there
when it gets bloody...

254
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,663
Somebody gotta
get their hands dirty...

255
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,672
Yep, it's a fucked-up job
But somebody's gotta do it...

256
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,503
Somebody gotta come up
with a plan...

257
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,941
And be there
when the shit hits the fan...

258
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,138
I hope
y'all out there understand...

259
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,874
Look, man,
it's a fucked-up job...

260
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,348
But somebody gotta be there
when it gets ugly...

261
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,885
Somebody gotta be there
when it gets bloody...

262
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:42,784
Somebody gotta
get their hands dirty...

263
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:45,983
Yep, it's a fucked-up job
But somebody's gotta do it...

264
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,802
The thing you have
to understand about Iraq

265
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,667
...is that there are
no front lines and rear lines.

266
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:02,571
The moment you get off the
plane, you're in harm's way.

267
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,872
This is a new war and the
action's kind of everywhere.

268
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,880
REIBER: When I was over there,
we were on a constant advancement.

269
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:13,248
And so there was never a single time
that we weren't open to mortar attacks...

270
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:17,312
...we weren't open to an ambush, we
weren't open to whatever it was.

271
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,482
ROBERT SCAER: There is
no sanctuary in this war.

272
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,389
In this war,
you're in combat all the time.

273
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,485
Not only if you're a combatant...

274
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:26,690
...but if you're a support
personnel. You're in the war zone.

275
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:32,230
It's a street-by-street
battle, a town-by-town battle...

276
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,795
...and the combatants
are invisible.

277
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,069
They look
just like the people.

278
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:40,644
DOUGHERTY: The enemy could be
anyone that you see.

279
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,404
You don't know
where to focus your attention.

280
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,609
You don't know
where to focus your anger.

281
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,244
The aggression and the hatred...

282
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,189
...that would be focused on a clear enemy
gets focused on every single Iraqi.

283
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,626
REIBER: It was just constant, you
know, surrounded by hundreds of people...

284
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,185
...hundreds of Iraqis.

285
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,232
The majority of them
have AK-47 s.

286
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,564
And you're getting hit by bricks
and they don't want you being there.

287
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,763
You're so compromised,
you know.

288
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:09,638
You drive on one block and
children are playing football...

289
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,404
...and they're laughing and they're
screaming, "America, America."

290
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:16,278
And then on the very next block
you'll get shot at, blown up, RPG.

291
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,307
They were telling us
little kids were running up...

292
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,114
...and stabbing the sides
of the doors.

293
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,881
So we had to get ammo boxes...

294
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,185
...and break them up and put them
in the sides of the doors.

295
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,656
I mean, they weren't
gonna stop bullets...

296
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:29,023
...but they'd stop little kids
trying to stab the doors.

297
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,791
We put sandbags in all of our
vehicles. The Army we had, we made it.

298
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,628
DENVER JONES: They show on TV

299
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:39,296
...all this high-tech equipment
that we would have and all.

300
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,172
I never seen any of it.

301
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:45,807
I mean, like I said,
I had a Vietnam-era flak vest...

302
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,476
...no armored vehicles...

303
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,576
...no intel...

304
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,777
...no real direction.

305
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,876
DELGADO: I used to ask guys,
"What are we here for?"

306
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,251
You know,
"What are we doing in Iraq?"

307
00:15:56,322 --> 00:16:00,122
And by and large what they said was,
"We're here because of September 11."

308
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:04,219
There was a disconnect between the
facts, or, you know, the reported news...

309
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,560
...and their, like,
emotional justification.

310
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:10,295
Most soldiers felt that what they
were doing was related to terrorism...

311
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,360
...either revenge or prevention.

312
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:15,805
To us, there really was
no mission. It was just...

313
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:20,010
The mission was, you know, just
get this crap over with and go home.

314
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,038
MULLINS: I've been on
over 150 combat missions...

315
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:28,610
...and, on most of those
missions, it had no purpose.

316
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:31,554
I grew up in Brooklyn. I've
been in a lot of fistfights.

317
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:35,992
And the one thing that I know is that if
someone hits me first, I'm pretty much done...

318
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,688
...you know,
if they get a good hit in.

319
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,492
And that's basically
what it was like in Iraq.

320
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:42,693
You wait for someone to sucker
punch you so you can punch back.

321
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,463
SARRA: You take
a 19-year-old kid...

322
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:47,471
...give him a rifle and as much
ammunition as he can carry...

323
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:51,334
...or put him behind the wheel
of a tank and tell him...

324
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,208
"You wanna go back home to your
girlfriend and all your buddies...

325
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:58,272
"and drinking beer and MTV and
Internet? Go destroy that city.

326
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:03,483
"Go through those guys that are trying
to stop you and I'll let you go home."

327
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,981
"Sir, yes, sir.
Done deal. See you."

328
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:11,729
MULLINS: Initially it's "Hey, I must do my
job, " and then it becomes, "I love this job."

329
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,321
All right,
get the fuck in there.

330
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:17,495
MULLINS: Some people just love to
shoot. Trigger-happy. And they'll shoot...

331
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,502
...not even
when something is wrong...

332
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,836
...but when they just think
something is wrong.

333
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,274
And I didn't wanna
cross that line, you know.

334
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,746
SARRA: We had been in a firefight,
we had been in an engagement.

335
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:32,443
The engagement was over and I see
this woman walking out in all black.

336
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,645
She's got a bag on her arm,
she's wearing a burka...

337
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,984
...and she's walking out
towards the armored vehicle.

338
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,423
And the guys on the amtrac start yelling,
waving their hands and telling her to stop...

339
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:41,789
...and they're raising
their weapons.

340
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,885
And I went, "Okay, one of
two things is gonna happen.

341
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:46,157
"This woman is gonna
put up her hands and surrender...

342
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,528
"and start talking
to the Marines...

343
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,624
"or she's gonna walk up
to these guys and explode."

344
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,794
If she blows up, she's gonna
kill a bunch of those guys...

345
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,203
...or wound a bunch of them. I've got
a clear shot with nothing behind her.

346
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:58,835
And this was all, I mean... This
was split-second, like, you know...

347
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,708
It happens that fast.

348
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,313
Pulled up my rifle,
took two shots at her.

349
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:11,416
I know I probably missed the first shot.
The second shot I'm pretty sure I hit her.

350
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,458
And as soon as
that second shot went off...

351
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:16,926
...the guys in the other vehicle
opened up and they cut her down.

352
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:20,328
She fell to the dirt and as she
fell she had a white flag in her hand...

353
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,458
...that she had
pulled out of her bag.

354
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,094
At that moment, right there,
I lost it.

355
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,434
I threw my weapon down
on the deck of the vehicle.

356
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:31,306
I was crying. I was like, " Oh, my God,
what are we doing here? What's happening?"

357
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,106
I had a gunnery sergeant who'd been
in the first war, he said, "It happens.

358
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:38,343
"There's nothing you can do to bring her
back. It happens. We gotta keep going."

359
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,784
At first, you know, you
think to yourself, you know...

360
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:45,255
"Wow, what a horrible country where
little kids can step on mines, you know...

361
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,848
"and there's no treatment
for them."

362
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,359
And then you think, you know,
"I'm glad I'm here to help."

363
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,419
And then, as things go on
you start to wonder...

364
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,727
"Could it have been one of my
guys that did this?" You know.

365
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,393
"Could it have been a
cluster bomb that we dropped?"

366
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,096
You know, "Could this kid have
been caught in friendly fire?"

367
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,298
And then you start to feel
like you're just a mechanic...

368
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,637
...fixing the things
that your friends broke.

369
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:07,442
I remember that the first
mission that we had was...

370
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:12,049
...at a POW camp,
at a prisoner of war camp.

371
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:16,921
And there we abused people, to keep
them awake for long periods of time...

372
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,254
...we kept them
on sleep deprivation.

373
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,921
And this was the first mission
that we had in Iraq

374
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,660
...and from there
we moved on to firefights...

375
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:32,226
...and raids and curfews
and traffic control points.

376
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:36,296
And the killings of civilians
started to pile up...

377
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:42,043
...and it became really difficult
for me morally...

378
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:46,608
...to feel comfortable with
what I was doing as a soldier.

379
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,317
NOEL: If you're
killing another man...

380
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:53,017
...a soldier and a soldier and
you're killing that other soldier...

381
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,584
I don't think
it'd probably be so bad...

382
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,186
'cause you're in a war and
that's the consequences of war.

383
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:01,426
You got to kill this man
'cause he's trying to kill you.

384
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,967
You understand?

385
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,196
But this war's
a different war.

386
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:09,770
This is a war you're fighting
men, women and children.

387
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,474
When you know
you gotta run these kids over...

388
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:17,709
...when you know you gotta put a bullet in
this woman and this woman is pregnant...

389
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,876
...that's what messes with you.

390
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:23,249
When you're looking at these
kids laying on the floor dead...

391
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:26,814
...and you see your child's face
laying on that floor...

392
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,757
...that's what messes with you.

393
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,227
That's why is
this war's so different.

394
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,994
'Cause you're just not
killing another soldier...

395
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,761
...you're killing a family.

396
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,001
SOLDIER: Jesus!

397
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:46,243
You don't go to war
in a country...

398
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,370
...and not go to war
with its people.

399
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,307
So I was seeing all of these
starving kids...

400
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,374
I was seeing bodies
by the side of the road.

401
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,249
You would go through
these battle zones...

402
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,222
...and there would just be tons of
dead people laying out in the road.

403
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:04,388
Whether they were Iraqi soldiers or
Iraqi civilians wasn't necessarily clear.

404
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:07,927
Families would ask, "Can we
come in and try to find our son?

405
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,865
"We think
you killed him last night."

406
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,837
And I felt, I mean, I felt at
least somewhat responsible for that.

407
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:17,068
Just like I had no control over the
circumstances that put me in Iraq...

408
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,337
...they had no control
over the circumstances...

409
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:22,107
...that put them and me
on the same battlefield.

410
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,744
SOLDIER: Is that it or what?

411
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:33,279
In combat,
you're killing for survival.

412
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:37,620
You're backed into a corner.
You can't go home.

413
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:40,597
You're in another country
13,000 miles away from home...

414
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,829
...and someone's shooting at you
and your friend...

415
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,336
...and the guys you've known
for six, eight, ten months...

416
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,066
...a year, two years,
three years.

417
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,500
And they just shot
somebody you know.

418
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:58,111
It's not about killing at
that point, it's about revenge.

419
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:01,949
It's about, "We're gonna take
you guys out so we can go home."

420
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,989
Like you turn on the news
every day and you hear a number...

421
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:08,891
...like, you hear, like,
14 wounded and 10 dead.

422
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,862
I mean, all it is is a number
and that's absolutely ridiculous.

423
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:15,229
It's just all they see is,
you know...

424
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,393
...two soldiers injured today,
three soldiers injured...

425
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,597
...and they think, "Okay, he'll be all
right, you know. He's just injured."

426
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,401
But they don't realize
injured is, you know...

427
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:25,170
...missing both his hands
or both his legs or whatever.

428
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:29,304
The number one injury in Iraq
is from bullets and bombs.

429
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,415
The number two injury
is psychological.

430
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,544
The number three injury
is endemic disease.

431
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,585
ACOSTA: A grenade was thrown
in my vehicle.

432
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,387
I grabbed it,
tried to throw it back out.

433
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,658
And when I did that, it fell between
my legs down on the floorboard.

434
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:50,998
So when I reached down to grab it again,
I had it in my right hand and it detonated.

435
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,936
It went off.
It took my hand off. It...

436
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:58,432
I got some shrapnel in my
vest, my legs were shattered.

437
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:02,435
My left leg... Or my right leg was
broken, my left leg was shattered.

438
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:05,574
It was pretty much just,
like, destroyed.

439
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:09,110
And it kind of, like, just...

440
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:12,719
It didn't hurt at all.
It didn't hurt really at all.

441
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:14,491
But it just confused me,
you know.

442
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,050
I was just, like, " Whoa, what
just happened?" You know.

443
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:21,828
We got in-country
in April of 2003.

444
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:26,360
And then I got injured
in the end of April 2004.

445
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,138
I couldn't see
anything at all.

446
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:30,697
I didn't have any eyesight
for about five months.

447
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:34,507
My right eye, they said, "Possibly
you have to have a cornea transplant."

448
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,104
I see like 20l200
out of it, right now.

449
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:40,242
I was in a truck accident.

450
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:42,980
That's nothing heroic.
It was just...

451
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:46,888
I was riding with this young
soldier that was driving too fast...

452
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:50,884
...and hit a hole in the highway.

453
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:55,924
And caused me come up and jam my
head into the ceiling of the vehicle...

454
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:59,664
...and then come down
on my tail area...

455
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,968
...and then shattered my spine.

456
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,334
And I'm disabled for life.

457
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,275
STOCKWELL: I was in a Humvee.

458
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,779
Unfortunately, they didn't
have any doors on the Humvee.

459
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,248
An IED went off,
a roadside bomb...

460
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:15,252
...and the Humvee swerved,
hit a guardrail.

461
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,118
And I think... I believe
that's where my leg got caught.

462
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,624
It's a left leg,
above-the-knee amputation.

463
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,823
I walked for the first time
today, which was very exciting.

464
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,816
ROBINSON: Part of the reason
they're surviving is that...

465
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:50,583
...technology has given us some
body armor that protects the torso...

466
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:54,113
...but they haven't gotten to the point
where they can protect the extremities.

467
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:58,060
And so guys that normally would've
died in Vietnam are surviving...

468
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:00,256
...but with horrible injuries.

469
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,197
None of us remember anything.

470
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,764
We all... I don't remember
anything about the crash, anyway.

471
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,898
I had a epiphany, dream,
whatever you want to call it.

472
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:13,006
"Boom." That's all
any of us really remember.

473
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:15,546
That's it. We're just
flying along and "boom."

474
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:22,050
Eighteen people out of the two
helicopters died, four of us made it out.

475
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,650
I think the number of killed
needs to be reexamined.

476
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:29,091
The number of wounded
needs to be reexamined.

477
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,424
And I think the big question
is the number of injured.

478
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:36,058
People who aren't, who don't sustain injury
as a result of enemy contact directly.

479
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:39,968
I think those numbers are much higher
than anybody really knows right now.

480
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,973
ED ELLIS: They don't give
even the body count now.

481
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,737
They keep it quiet,
on both sides.

482
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,835
So they try to keep death
out of it.

483
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:49,847
This is so ironic, you know.
They have...

484
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,713
This is the most profound
killing machines...

485
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,046
...if you could say
profound is the word for it...

486
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,020
...but most expert killing
machines ever invented.

487
00:25:57,088 --> 00:26:00,819
Yet the actual killing
is kept out of the equation.

488
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:03,720
SOLDIER:
Gun on that rooftop...

489
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,829
We've increased the hit rate...

490
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:18,205
...from around 20%
just a few decades ago...

491
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,971
...to around 90% today.

492
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:23,208
Now, that's about a six-fold
increase in the firing rate.

493
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:25,379
And those who are firing...

494
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,442
...are at least four times more likely
to hit what they're shooting at.

495
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,546
Because instead of a panic-stricken
spray-and-pray response...

496
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,454
...they're actually
hitting the target.

497
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:47,729
HUZE: We got into a lot of firefights.
We didn't lose a single Marine.

498
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:52,073
It was because,
in certain areas...

499
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,973
...everything was
considered hostile.

500
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,244
Taking fire
from that general direction...

501
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,516
...there are 50 fucking people there,
it's one guy is shooting at us.

502
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:07,683
You know, we can't find the one
guy, fucking kill everything.

503
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,855
You know, lay fire down over there.
Suppression fire, area target.

504
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,460
You know, you don't think...

505
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:17,194
"Oh, okay, there's a lady in a
pink dress, let's take her out.

506
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:19,395
"There's a kid, well, you
know, let's take him out."

507
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:23,202
No. We're taking fire from over
there, blanket the fucking area.

508
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:27,234
It works.
It's effective, you know.

509
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,637
You don't take fire
from that area anymore.

510
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:32,945
You know, threat's eliminated.

511
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:36,948
And you keep going.

512
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:42,916
ANDERSON: When we finally
got to Baghdad...

513
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:46,191
...and I spent some time with the infantry
company that was attached to us...

514
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,095
...those guys actually would
tease each other...

515
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,963
...if they didn't get a kill in
during the day.

516
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:55,204
And until you got a kill,
you'd be made fun of.

517
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,901
You want to be the coward? You want
to be the guy who doesn't do it?

518
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:00,706
You want everyone
to look back at you?

519
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:03,479
And it's shame.

520
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:07,848
I mean, in some... I mean, you'll
do it. You're just gonna do it.

521
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,184
Everyone, I mean... You know,
peer-pressure group killing.

522
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,656
I mean, you know.

523
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,455
And you go ahead
and you do it.

524
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,860
I don't think that
it's necessarily courage.

525
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,957
The killing and the abusing
and the dehumanizing of people...

526
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:27,334
...it doesn't really come in it
because that's the world. That's it.

527
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:32,308
Like it's taken and you're just trapped
in the bubble and that's what it is.

528
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:36,677
JONES: I've seen one of the soldiers slow
his truck down like he was gonna stop.

529
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:40,582
And he slowed down like he
was gonna stop for the child...

530
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:43,780
...and then he speeded
the truck up and ran over him.

531
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:47,086
But the Army told us
if we was...

532
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:50,594
If somebody got in front of
the truck, to run over them.

533
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:53,859
The person that was riding
with me was angry about it...

534
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:57,891
...but then again they said, "Well,
that's what the Army told us to do.

535
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:00,796
"Just gotta mark it up."

536
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:04,864
MASSEY: We were on
the outskirts of Baghdad...

537
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,138
...and we had set up
a checkpoint.

538
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,544
Well, this particular day
the car didn't stop...

539
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:12,606
...and we discharged our weapons
into the vehicle.

540
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:16,949
And they were rolling
on the side of the road...

541
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:19,455
...in pain and agony.

542
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:24,120
And the driver of the vehicle,
the one that, the survivor...

543
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:26,663
...he went over to his brother,
and I was watching him.

544
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,460
And he picked
his brother's head up...

545
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,694
...and he's crying and he's
weeping back and forth.

546
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,964
And I'm assuming
that his brother expired...

547
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:36,632
'cause he gets up and he
walks directly towards me.

548
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:39,700
And he gets about an arm's
length distance away from me...

549
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,042
...and he goes, "You did this."

550
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,911
He goes, "Why did you kill my
brother? We're not terrorists.

551
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:46,917
"We're not, you know,
we're not insurgents.

552
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:50,011
"We didn't do anything,
we didn't do anything wrong."

553
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:53,546
And it was that moment
that hit me.

554
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,253
I said, " Whoa,
what are we doing here?"

555
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:59,990
"You know, what's our purpose?
What's our mission?"

556
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:04,626
We just shot
three innocent Iraqis.

557
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:08,505
You know, they didn't have any...
They weren't doing anything wrong.

558
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,675
KEVIN LUCEY: He was told to,
"Pull the fucking trigger, Lucey."

559
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:17,981
And then he shot that man,
and then he shot the other man.

560
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:20,950
He looked at the man...

561
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:26,047
...and he could see the fear,
the terror in the man's eyes.

562
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:31,292
And Jeff said, you know, all
of a sudden he just wondered...

563
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:35,264
...was he there
because he had to be there...

564
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,800
...like Jeff was?

565
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,266
And then he just thought
about him being...

566
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,705
JOYCE LUCEY: His family. He said
he could see this boy's family.

567
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:48,610
That he must've had a mother or a father
or maybe a wife, children, whatever.

568
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:51,374
I mean, just quick things
that go through.

569
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:54,145
I mean, I'm sure it was a very
small space of time but just...

570
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,619
He said, just the quick things
that went through his head.

571
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:00,385
And he told his sister that his
gun was shaking as he was aiming it.

572
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,221
He told me he was a murderer.

573
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:04,784
He said, " Don't you understand
your brother's a murderer?"

574
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:09,365
JOYCE: "I'm the mother of
Corporal Jeffrey Michael Lucey.

575
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:12,494
"Yesterday would've been
his 24th birthday.

576
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:17,507
"I say 'would've been' because Jeff
died on June 22nd at the age of 23.

577
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,937
"His dad and I
have struggled every day...

578
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:24,504
"since my husband found Jeff hanging
by our garden hose in the basement.

579
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,046
"He chose to end his life
after struggling...

580
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,747
"with the demons of post-traumatic
stress for several months...

581
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,916
"after his return from Iraq.

582
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,051
"Some may say
Jeff returned unharmed...

583
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:39,563
"but the young man that came home
without obvious physical wounds...

584
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,293
"was destroyed
by the dark hidden pain...

585
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,892
"of the emotional cost
of this war."

586
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,808
Guns go snap...

587
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,207
Money goes snap...

588
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,745
Life goes snap...

589
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,047
Lights go snap...

590
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:08,649
Cannons go snap...

591
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,656
Mind goes snap...

592
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,792
Nerves go snap...

593
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,229
Necks go snap...

594
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,506
Live wire snap...

595
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,706
Life goes snap...

596
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:37,445
Tell me how does God choose?

597
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:41,117
Whose prayers does he refuse?

598
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:46,554
Who turns the wheel?

599
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,566
Who throws the dice...

600
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:54,970
...on the day after tomorrow?

601
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:06,039
STAN GOFF: Killing is just
one aspect of it.

602
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:09,450
I think what's important for people
to understand about an occupation is...

603
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,988
...the whole situation
is one of domination.

604
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,555
It's when you are obliged...

605
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:16,718
...by the nature of your job
to dominate people...

606
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:20,855
...so killing is just sort of, you know,
the icing on the cake, so to speak.

607
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:23,059
There's the day-to-day reality...

608
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:26,297
...of behaving abusively
toward people...

609
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:31,308
...of threatening people
with guns, of...

610
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:35,512
In the case of Iraq, a lot
of times rounding up people...

611
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,016
...against whom you have
no evidence of any crime.

612
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:41,643
SOLDIER: Turn your head. Turn your head.
Yes, yes, yes. All right. All right.

613
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:44,654
Turn your fucking head.
You fucking there. Okay.

614
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,416
Get your fucking head down!

615
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,289
Turn your head!

616
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,225
Turn your head!
Yes, yes, yes.

617
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:52,421
Hold this.

618
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,923
You stay.
Yes.

619
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,331
All right. All right.

620
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:59,336
DELGADO: It's the way
the military operates.

621
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,804
And the way the government
and the military together...

622
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,239
...have indoctrinated soldiers
to think it's okay...

623
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:07,106
...to do this to Arabs, to do this to
Muslims, to do this to the enemy.

624
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,610
Here. Here's your cane.

625
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,748
Hey, sit down, you.

626
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,325
Hey, come on. SOLDIER 1:
Hey, cut the sob scene.

627
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,827
Put them all in this room.

628
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,491
Put them all in here.
Put all the women in here.

629
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,227
Christ. SOLDIER 1: No,
no, no, no. You two women.

630
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:32,363
Okay, you two.
You two.

631
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,701
SOLDIER 2: You, come here.

632
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:45,940
SOLDIER 1: You can stay
in there.

633
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:48,850
It'll probably take you an
hour for you to get back up.

634
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,912
DELGADO: There were similar type
abuses going on in Nasiriyah...

635
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,923
...you know, breaking bottles
over people's heads...

636
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:56,323
...or whipping children
with an antenna.

637
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:59,557
And these types of abuses
happened everywhere.

638
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,064
If you put anyone
in harsh enough circumstances...

639
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:05,796
...they become the person
who's capable of doing that.

640
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,838
And so in a way,
we're all subject to that.

641
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,305
We could all do that, given
the proper circumstances.

642
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,740
And some people have lower
breaking points than others.

643
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:15,176
We had one guy
that was brought in...

644
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:20,149
...who had been identified as like a
senior-ranking Al-Qaeda member, you know.

645
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:23,619
Or Taliban, you know. He
was brought in as a bad guy.

646
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:27,624
And he had been hung by his hands
for three days from a tree, you know.

647
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:31,526
And his hands were completely gangrenous
and we had to amputate both of them.

648
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:34,656
And they told us, "Watch out for
this guy, you know. He's really bad."

649
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:37,826
And then after a couple of weeks of him
being in our clinic, they let him go.

650
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,631
And they said, "Our mistake."

651
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,069
SOLDIER 1: You better stop!

652
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,572
My ass.

653
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,509
You run my goddamn checkpoint,
I'll fucking shoot you.

654
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:49,978
SOLDIER 2: Get out!
Get out of the goddamn car!

655
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,741
REIBER: We didn't call them
insurgents when we were over there.

656
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,581
We called them just hajis,
you know.

657
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:59,214
They weren't the Republican
Guard. They weren't civilians.

658
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,780
They're just the enemy.

659
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:05,022
And I engaged a vehicle with a.50-caliber
machine gun and blew it up, you know.

660
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,654
It was a pretty big explosion.

661
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:10,167
Found out that they had gasoline and
they were gonna take out the checkpoint.

662
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:12,429
But I remember laughing
after I blew it up.

663
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:17,031
And then driving by and seeing burning,
you know, the flesh dripping off, on fire.

664
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:21,067
And none of us
even talked about it.

665
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:23,909
After it happened it was gone.
It was done.

666
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,677
My Captain, he came walking
up to me and he said...

667
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,845
"What's the matter, Staff Sergeant?
You look a little under the weather."

668
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:32,549
And I said, " Well, sir,
today's been a bad day.

669
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:34,921
"We've killed
a lot of innocent civilians."

670
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:38,189
And he looked at me and he said,
" No, today has been a good day."

671
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:39,661
And he walked off.

672
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:43,728
And I thought to myself, "This isn't
the Marine Corps that I signed up for.

673
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:47,999
"This isn't the Marine Corps
that I want to belong to."

674
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:52,234
PILOT: I got numerous individuals on
the road. You want me to take those out?

675
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,540
MAN: Take them out. This
is not a good day for them.

676
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:57,239
Okay.

677
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:06,480
Ten seconds.
Roger.

678
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:17,861
Impact.

679
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:21,432
CO-PILOT: Oh, dude.

680
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:28,638
It's very hard to take somebody and
turn them into someone that can do that.

681
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:31,807
And then what they want you
to believe...

682
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:34,715
...is that they can do that and then
revert you back to a civilian.

683
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:37,913
And that's absolutely
as ridiculous as it sounds.

684
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,116
SHOOTER: Roger.
MAN: Hit him.

685
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,220
Got him.
Good.

686
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:45,887
Second one.
Hit the other one.

687
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,289
Movement right there.

688
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,664
Roger. He's wounded.
Hit him.

689
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:53,863
I'll hit the truck.

690
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,372
Get the truck and him.
Go forward of it and hit him.

691
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,068
Roger.

692
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:06,178
I am not fighting for justice...

693
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:10,744
I am not fighting for freedom...

694
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:15,656
I am fighting for my life...

695
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:22,057
And another day
in the world here...

696
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:26,569
I just do what I've been told...

697
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:30,874
We're just the gravel
on the road...

698
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:37,080
And only the lucky ones
come home...

699
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:43,175
On the day after tomorrow...

700
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,321
There he is.

701
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,398
Oh, my God.

702
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:58,799
Welcome home.

703
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:00,898
Daddy!

704
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,877
Oh, God, I missed you so much.

705
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,177
Look at this guy.

706
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:16,218
Glad to be home.

707
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:20,981
DELGADO: We got in the big room and
we got these little PDA Palm Pilots...

708
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:23,026
...and we had to fill out
a survey saying...

709
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,584
...were we thinking
of committing suicide.

710
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:28,325
Were we thinking of killing anyone,
were we thinking of abusing our spouse.

711
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:31,926
They offered us the chance
for psychological services.

712
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:33,799
They offered the choice
of going home...

713
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,362
...or staying at that Army base
to receive treatment.

714
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,900
And after serving for one year in
Iraq, nobody would willingly choose...

715
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:44,106
...to stay on an Army base for
months after to be treated.

716
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:48,680
SARRA: As these vets come back,
you're not gonna know who they are.

717
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:53,214
They kind of
ghost into society.

718
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:56,016
They might be the quiet kid
in the back of a college class.

719
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:59,426
They might be, you know, a kid
that's cleaning up at McDonald's.

720
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:02,864
It might be... You know, you
don't know. You have no idea.

721
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:08,266
It's not like we come back with a
sign, you know, that says, "Hey, vet."

722
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:11,001
There are some guys who just
don't wanna talk about it.

723
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,407
We all become
casualties of war.

724
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,637
Who we are when we leave
is not who we are when...

725
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:19,581
...and if we're lucky,
to physically return.

726
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:22,483
Because psychologically...

727
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:26,815
...you're completely
changed by it.

728
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:30,086
I was blessed that he was home
in one piece...

729
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:33,096
...and he wasn't home
in a body bag or a coffin.

730
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:38,700
But a part of him died over
there and I don't think...

731
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:43,834
I take that back. I know that he'll
never be that same person again.

732
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:45,705
HUZE: I'm now back
with my wife.

733
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,370
I get to be with them
and I get to be a daddy again...

734
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,471
...and I get to be
a husband again.

735
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,948
But I've got all this stuff.

736
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:54,575
And you don't...

737
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:57,746
For me, I didn't feel like
I could share that...

738
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,581
...to start with.
I mean, how could I?

739
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,819
My wife's so proud of me,
so how can I tell her...

740
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:05,384
...about seeing a bunch
of civilians that are dead?

741
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:09,627
How could I tell her about the dead kid
I saw laying on the side of the road?

742
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:11,327
How...

743
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:16,264
Then I go from being a hero to a
monster. And I felt like a monster.

744
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,071
My friends and my family were
scared to even be with me.

745
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,280
They... I'd find myself
outside and...

746
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:26,512
The girlfriend that I did
have, I was really aggressive...

747
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:29,246
...and grabbed her by the arm
and scared her almost to death.

748
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,312
And she didn't wanna have anything
to do with me from then on.

749
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,653
It was a mess.
I was a mess when I came back.

750
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:37,785
I was really impatient when I first...
'Cause I wanted my eyesight back...

751
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:41,161
...and they were like, "Well, you
know, we're gonna do an operation.

752
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:45,931
"Then we have to wait two to three
months, you know, and see how it looks."

753
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,869
The doctors left it up to her.

754
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:50,668
You know, if she could handle
it, well, then I could go home.

755
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:54,108
I had to play nurse with him.
He got to come home with me.

756
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,839
He was blind.
I took care of the kids...

757
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:58,313
...had to take care of the house,
had to take care of my husband.

758
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:02,148
Had to bathe him, had to do everything,
you know, and it's stressful.

759
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:04,084
It's... It...

760
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:09,722
I didn't know when it was gonna end. I
wanted it to just end. I wanted it over.

761
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:14,287
I wanted to be where we are now, back
then, because it was just... It was so hard.

762
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:18,392
He wouldn't talk. He looked so bad. I
couldn't cry because he could hear me.

763
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:21,996
You know, he might not have been
able to see me but he could hear.

764
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,868
I have my days.
You know, like I...

765
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:28,602
There's times where I'm glad
I'm alive, I'm glad I made it.

766
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:32,479
And then there's times where I wish it
would have killed me 'cause it's hard.

767
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,486
I mean, not only just the fact
that I lost my hand...

768
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,682
...and I have to deal with that every
single morning when I wake up...

769
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:42,453
...but I can't run.

770
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:45,552
I can't, you know,
there's things I can't do.

771
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:49,491
Like, my way of living just kind
of, like, didn't exist for a while.

772
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,865
It was just kind of like
just going.

773
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:54,336
Like, kind of lost, in a way.

774
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:57,903
It's, like, Sandy, she told
me last night, she was, like...

775
00:42:57,975 --> 00:42:59,909
"You know, I'd like to go
dancing or something."

776
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:03,276
But I... We can't, you know. It's
just something that we can't do.

777
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:06,316
I'd like to feel comfortable
when I go out.

778
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:10,717
Just the other day this guy
asked me how'd I lose my hand?

779
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:13,814
And I told him, "I lost it in
the war." And he said, "What war?"

780
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:17,054
And I told him, "The war in Iraq."
And he said, "That's still going on?"

781
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:20,096
And I was just like, "Yeah,
dude, it's still going on."

782
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:22,758
When I went on convalescent
leave for 30 days...

783
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,494
I spent thousands of dollars
on alcohol.

784
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:30,165
I tried to drink myself,
you know, back to reality.

785
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:33,408
And it didn't work, and
then one day I just woke up...

786
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:37,171
...and I was like, "You know what?
Maybe I'm here for a reason.

787
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,772
"I'm here to make sure
their names never die...

788
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,250
"their memories never die,
and to make sure...

789
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,846
"that no other soldier has to go through
what I had to go through on their own."

790
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:48,517
I took all that anger
that I had in Iraq...

791
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:52,084
...and that feeling of not caring
about myself and then wanting to die...

792
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:54,528
...and I brought it home with me.
I didn't leave it in Iraq.

793
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:57,192
I didn't turn it in
with my duffle bags, you know...

794
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:58,700
I kept it with me.

795
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:03,062
REIBER: The worst thing
is that you don't fit.

796
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:05,539
You don't fit anywhere.

797
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:09,045
And there's no place for you
to fit in except by yourself.

798
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:11,980
And then, you know, you
don't like yourself anymore.

799
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:14,916
I'm not a person
that wants to kill myself...

800
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,782
...but if there was ever a time
that I didn't...

801
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:18,913
You know, that I felt
that way, it was then.

802
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:22,948
And that's horrible, you know, being
out of the military for the first day...

803
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:26,394
...and you can't go to sleep at
night because you hate yourself.

804
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:29,728
And you hate what you just
did. It's a horrible feeling.

805
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,701
It was difficult for me
to say, you know...

806
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:36,103
"Hey, we did something
horrible over there.

807
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,767
"And, you know,
I'm having nightmares about it...

808
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,003
"and I'm having flashbacks
about it."

809
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:44,210
You know, especially being
a Marine, because you're...

810
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:46,841
...you know, you're supposed
to be this superman.

811
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:50,580
Marines are the golden boys
of America, the supermen.

812
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:53,282
You know, we're not supposed
to come home...

813
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,621
...and have those feelings.

814
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:59,285
After the high of coming back
a war hero has gone down...

815
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:02,332
...then they begin to think, "Well,
maybe what I did wasn't so great...

816
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:04,629
"or wasn't so brave.
I'm not such a hero."

817
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:08,468
Even guys who hated the war in my unit
say sometimes they wish they could go back...

818
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:11,064
...so they could go back to that
feeling of having a purpose.

819
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,871
'Cause it's that silence, that
emptiness, being by yourself...

820
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:17,277
...that really forces that introspection
that's painful, and nobody wants to do that.

821
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:19,406
When you cross that line,
when you kill someone...

822
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,508
...how the hell...
Like, I could barely...

823
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:23,746
I had so much trouble
transitioning when I came home.

824
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:26,688
And I'm still, I still have
my depressed moments, you know...

825
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,748
...but it's not as dark
as it was.

826
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:33,520
And I can't imagine
where I would be if I did...

827
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,491
...have that memory of
shooting someone, you know.

828
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:39,536
Split-second decision that's
made, you pull a trigger...

829
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:41,503
...it triggers something else.

830
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,667
You can't take it back.

831
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,607
No matter what I do...

832
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:52,043
...if I go back to Iraq, if I,
you know, become a Muslim...

833
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:56,553
...you know, if I read the Koran every
day, I cannot bring back that woman.

834
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:01,187
And there's nothing
I can do about it.

835
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:06,992
ACOSTA: Just think about it, though,
like, you're ending somebody's life.

836
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,794
I mean, it doesn't bother you
then. I mean, my main concern...

837
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:12,802
I didn't care at the time
that people were dead.

838
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,997
Like, I looked the guy
in the eyes, you know.

839
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:18,473
Probably has a kid or a family
or a wife or something.

840
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:22,140
Somebody to go home to. He's
not gonna go home tonight.

841
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:25,944
It's just death, you know.
It's just death.

842
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:29,708
And it's survival...

843
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:38,893
...and it's just not
giving a shit, you know.

844
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,597
And I think, for me,
that that's...

845
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:46,331
For me, that's the thing that's so
tough to deal with and reconcile...

846
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:51,233
...is the loss of humanity...

847
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:55,675
I think, and that it's not
always easy to tap back into it.

848
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:09,019
I think one thing one has to do
is to make the soldier realize...

849
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:12,152
...that he's not suffering from
a psychological disability.

850
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:15,892
He's suffering from a change in
his brain function and structure...

851
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:19,163
...that's produced by a terrible,
life-threatening experience...

852
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:21,466
...and that everybody would have
done the same thing.

853
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:23,028
Post-traumatic
stress disorder...

854
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:27,202
...the number one thing is they're
reliving it some way or other.

855
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:30,371
It's like someone says, "What are
you doing with that? The war is over."

856
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:32,248
And there's one poet who said...

857
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:36,548
"Yes, the war is over and over and
over and over again in my mind."

858
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:41,852
And they can be in dreams,
it could be in flashbacks...

859
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:45,691
...which get a lot of press but I
think don't exist very frequently.

860
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:49,796
It could be in intrusive thoughts,
that's the most common one.

861
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,199
And there are people
who have intrusive thoughts...

862
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:54,794
...every day, almost all day.

863
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:59,198
HUZE: The things that are most difficult
for me are the images of the kids...

864
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:00,766
...dead children.

865
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:04,140
Images of women.

866
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,739
Images of men that...

867
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:10,776
I mean, I would venture,
were non-combatants.

868
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:13,421
When I see car wrecks
and when I hear...

869
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,254
...not even explosions
but cars backfiring...

870
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,226
I don't see what everyone
else sees, you know.

871
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:23,562
I see mental images in my mind
that have to do with the war.

872
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:30,166
And that's hard to deal with. I
mean, that still bothers me when I see...

873
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,037
...even a, you know, car wreck,
people laying in...

874
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:34,339
It has nothing to do... They
don't have military clothes.

875
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:37,039
And all of a sudden I'll see my
friend that's laying on the ground...

876
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:38,342
...with half of his head gone.

877
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:39,905
I don't know. It's just...

878
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:42,577
This whole thing sucks.

879
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:46,353
All this sucks.
I mean, like...

880
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:50,823
It's just messing up a lot of
things. I mean, like, even...

881
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:53,920
Like, God, I'm so glad
I have Sandy because, I mean...

882
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:56,488
...anybody else that wasn't
as strong as she is...

883
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:59,296
...would have probably left me
a long time ago.

884
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:03,066
And, you know, she said last night,
and it really made me feel good...

885
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,165
...she's like, " Well,
we're in this together."

886
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:07,506
You know, 'cause I told her,
"Look, I think I need therapy."

887
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:10,171
'Cause I'm, like,
not doing too good and...

888
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,413
I don't know,
I have a lot of just...

889
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:17,647
I don't know if... I don't know
what it is, I just have a lot of it.

890
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:19,450
Nobody calls these people up
and says...

891
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:22,617
"Hey, I wanna ask you a couple questions
and make sure you're doing okay.

892
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:24,752
"I wanna ask how you're doing.
How's your family doing?"

893
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:28,286
So usually, when they finally get
to the point of diagnosing PTSD

894
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:30,560
...or something else, it's after
there's been an episode...

895
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:34,434
...a marital problem or a crime
or a meltdown at work...

896
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:38,338
...or a serious fight
with a friend or a sibling.

897
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:41,809
And then they go, "Wow! I'm messed
up. I've got something to deal with."

898
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:45,336
And then, hopefully, they come
forward and seek help at the VA.

899
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:47,648
MASSEY: So I reported in...

900
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:52,485
...and I seen a psychologist,
and I explained to her...

901
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:56,185
I said, " You know, this is everything
that had happened while we were in Iraq.

902
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:58,784
"We killed a lot of innocent
civilians and that's my problem.

903
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:01,228
"That's what I'm having
a problem dealing with."

904
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:05,166
And she looked at me and she said,
" Staff Sergeant, I can't help you."

905
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:07,032
I said, " What do you mean,
you can't help me?

906
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:09,868
"You know, you're a psychologist.
That's what I'm here for."

907
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,966
She goes, " I don't deal
with conscientious objectors."

908
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:15,369
I lost it. I said...

909
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:18,471
"What? You're gonna label me
as a conscientious objector...

910
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:20,778
"for not wanting
to kill innocent civilians?"

911
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,513
I said, " You're nuts
so there's no way, you know...

912
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:25,646
"you can label me
as a conscientious objector."

913
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:29,351
I killed people. I killed
innocent people for this country...

914
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:33,192
...in the defense of whatever
the reason why we were in Iraq.

915
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:38,663
JACKIE MASSEY: It really hit home
one day when I went to the gym...

916
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:40,794
...to go work out, you know,
and he was fine.

917
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,101
He was taking a nap
on the couch.

918
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:48,971
And when I came home,
he had smashed a desk...

919
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:51,671
...that was sitting
in our living room.

920
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:55,109
And he had kicked it
with his feet...

921
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:57,415
...he had hit it with his fist.

922
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:02,621
And I guess that was the part that
really kind of struck home to me that...

923
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,524
...you know, " Wow, I'm married to...

924
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:09,021
"someone who has been to war...

925
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:12,932
"who has seen a lot of death
and a lot of destruction...

926
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,338
"and this is
what it's doing to him."

927
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:20,140
We still have that ball
in our gut, of adrenaline...

928
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:23,941
...and still the mentality
of operating in a combat zone.

929
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:26,642
We can't... You can't just
turn that off, you know...

930
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:29,810
'cause we were taught how
to do that for three years...

931
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:32,184
...or however long
that you're in for...

932
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,779
...and you can't just
turn it off.

933
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:38,351
And so when you get out, I expected
that I should act the same way.

934
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:42,455
I was driving on the freeway in
the Bronx, on the Major Deegan...

935
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:44,466
...and someone
cut me off one day.

936
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:47,560
And I got so pissed off,
I followed him off his exit...

937
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:49,798
I got out of the car, wrapped
my T-shirt around my hand...

938
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:51,773
...and I went
to punch his window in.

939
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:55,369
And then I realized that there was
nothing restraining me when I came home.

940
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:59,347
I just held that frustration
inside. I brought that home with me.

941
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:01,579
I didn't associate it
with Iraq.

942
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:03,551
I didn't associate it
with frustration...

943
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,815
...my past frustration,
my past experiences.

944
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:07,914
I just felt, at that moment,
I was angry...

945
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:11,483
...and this is gonna be my
appropriate reaction to his actions.

946
00:52:12,496 --> 00:52:15,397
Whatever the normal
response is...

947
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:18,491
...they were taught in basic
training to respond even faster.

948
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:22,060
And their life depended on it,
their buddy's life depended on it.

949
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:26,371
And so they come back and
then it's not appropriate here.

950
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:28,276
There's an old saying that...

951
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:30,745
...if you're a good soldier,
you'll be a bad civilian.

952
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,213
And this is part of it.

953
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:35,740
You've been taught to be angry,
you've been taught to kill...

954
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:39,311
...and it was necessary, maybe,
for your salvation and survival.

955
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:41,653
It's not adaptive now.

956
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:44,753
It has a lot more to do...

957
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:48,590
...with having one's
worldview shattered...

958
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:52,225
...and feeling like
there's no safe place anymore.

959
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:57,135
And it's one thing to sort of trade
your worldview in for another one...

960
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:59,869
...than to have it just shattered
with nothing to replace it.

961
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:01,376
It leaves people at odds...

962
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:04,208
...and it leads to situations where
you're trying to deal with this.

963
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:07,842
And a lot of times people tend
to become very fragmented.

964
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:11,977
ACOSTA: Well, there's times where
I think it's going away, like...

965
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:15,582
...and I'll, like, go weeks at
a time without anything and...

966
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:19,154
Just last night, like,
I couldn't sleep at all...

967
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:22,562
'cause I don't know, like, I thought
somebody was in the house or something.

968
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:24,998
And I swore up and down there
was somebody on the roof.

969
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:28,970
And then you know that feeling you
get when you don't wanna move at all.

970
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,404
And then...

971
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:34,838
I don't know, I was really paranoid.
I sleep with a gun under my bed.

972
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:37,402
And, like, you know, like...

973
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:42,206
Just really bothers me sometimes. Like,
any little thing, I'll go investigate.

974
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:45,152
I started carrying around
a gun with me wherever I went...

975
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:48,350
...because I felt
a lot safer doing that.

976
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:52,862
And, you know, it was just a part of
me that I didn't let go from the Army.

977
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:56,922
And one night I was,
I drank, like, 175 of whisky...

978
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,163
...and went to a party,
and a guy pissed me off.

979
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:04,037
And so I pulled it out and I loaded it,
put it to his head, pulled the trigger...

980
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:07,270
...and it didn't go off,
and so I pistol-whipped him.

981
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:10,177
And from there I...

982
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,248
They called the cops,
you know. I pointed...

983
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:14,579
I was really drunk
so I, you know...

984
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:16,675
...pointed it at everybody,
told them to get away.

985
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:19,347
The cops came in. I got
rid of the weapon, actually.

986
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:22,084
They didn't even catch me
with it...

987
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,152
...but I fought the cops off
for a while.

988
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:27,196
Fought two of them off me
and tried to get away...

989
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,732
...and then got beat up
pretty good by the police.

990
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:33,633
And was thrown in jail, charged with
felony, assault with a deadly weapon.

991
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:35,534
I had, like, seven felonies.

992
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:38,369
You know, of course, they were
trying to slam me with everything.

993
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,272
But sitting in jail...

994
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:44,140
...in a jail cell, you know,
full of dirtbags, pretty much...

995
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:48,914
...it was just a huge reality
check of, "What am I doing?"

996
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:51,013
One minute, you know,
everyone was...

997
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:53,920
Everyone in my family
was proud of me, you know.

998
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:57,452
Got quite a few medals
in Iraq and Afghanistan...

999
00:54:57,527 --> 00:54:59,688
...did really well as a soldier.

1000
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:02,055
Everyone was proud of me
because I did that...

1001
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:06,762
...and now I'm sitting in a jail cell
facing 5 to 10 years in prison.

1002
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:08,963
Luckily, I just got
break after break.

1003
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:13,635
Instead of going to five years in
prison, I went to a PTSD program.

1004
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:18,305
That's been the most, probably,
positive thing that's happened to me...

1005
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:20,315
...because it made me think,
you know.

1006
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:22,908
"What am I doing?
What am I so angry about?"

1007
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:27,814
JOYCE: The emotional scars that these
troops are bringing back with them...

1008
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:30,891
...we don't understand it,
we don't see it.

1009
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,727
It's not a physical thing that you can look
at and say, "Well, this boy was wounded."

1010
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:40,168
And our son hid this for a
long time from a lot of people.

1011
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:43,399
Even his unit didn't see it.
Nobody saw it coming.

1012
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:48,708
All of a sudden it exploded,
and it exploded months later.

1013
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:53,248
And it caught us
off guard.

1014
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:57,314
And, you know, regretfully, we had
conditioned ourselves in a way that...

1015
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:59,821
"Okay, Jeff is having
a bad day."

1016
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,917
We never knew...

1017
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:06,189
...the depth of the torture, the depth
of the hell he was going through.

1018
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:10,498
I was seeing a psychologist at
the VA, when I was depressed...

1019
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:12,228
...but I stopped.

1020
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:16,399
And I wasn't doing anything.

1021
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:19,931
And I know that that was the
end of the road for me, you know.

1022
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:22,409
I knew
where I was going from there.

1023
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:26,277
And I made a conscious
decision to go there, you know.

1024
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:28,611
I knew that I would...

1025
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:34,114
That ultimately I would
probably just kill myself.

1026
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:41,187
I wanted to die but I
didn't wanna kill myself.

1027
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:44,758
Like, I would think that
I was gonna die anyway.

1028
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:47,462
Like, I'd just walk outside
and get hit by a bus, you know.

1029
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:51,166
Just 'cause I've been through
so much shit, it can't be...

1030
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,236
Death can't be that far away.

1031
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:59,110
NICKIE: A good friend of ours
had been in Iraq

1032
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:02,049
...for about eight months,
nine months. Came home.

1033
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:04,211
Had been trying to get custody
of his little girl.

1034
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:05,948
Finally got custody of her.

1035
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:08,650
Three weeks after he's had
her, he's at his friend's house.

1036
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:10,625
And he's got a babysitter
for her.

1037
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:14,185
And he called up the babysitter and
nobody, I mean, nobody talked about it.

1038
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,824
Called up the babysitter and said,
" Hey, can I talk to my little girl?"

1039
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,460
She said, " No, she's asleep
already." And he just said...

1040
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:22,130
"Okay, well, just tell her that
her daddy loves her very much."

1041
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,833
Hung up the phone
and killed himself, you know.

1042
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:28,605
And when everybody was talking about it,
and when they found him and they were...

1043
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:30,646
"Oh, well, was he drinking?
Was he doing drugs?"

1044
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:33,773
I mean, they thought of
everything that they could think of...

1045
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:37,342
...as an excuse why he did this
except the biggest one.

1046
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:40,821
Nobody stopped to realize that
this man had just been in a war zone...

1047
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:44,326
...for nine months, a year,
and nobody talked about that.

1048
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:48,588
I read the other day, there were
suicides that are occurring in Iraq...

1049
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:51,463
...and one of the public
relations people said...

1050
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:54,935
"Those people probably would
have killed themselves anyway."

1051
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:59,464
And I found that hard to believe,
that that would be their position.

1052
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:03,176
But they take the position
that wartime experiences...

1053
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:05,808
...have no bearing on suicides.

1054
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:17,719
I'll just start unloading them
right here.

1055
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:20,456
ACOSTA: I'm 22 years old
and I'm all...

1056
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:23,198
I'm all messed up
and my legs...

1057
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:24,358
Shit.

1058
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:27,462
Messed up. And it's hard
to wake up in the morning.

1059
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:29,004
My hand's gone.

1060
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:31,296
My hips are all messed up
now 'cause...

1061
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:34,172
Just walking all weird,
my knees hurt.

1062
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:36,712
Like, I had goals
in the military, you know.

1063
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:40,943
Like, never before had I had
goals and that was all taken away.

1064
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:46,317
SANDY RESTREPO: Every day he wakes up, it's
kind of like a different person, you know.

1065
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:51,053
And it's just like what, you know,
today is it gonna be happy Robert...

1066
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:55,291
...or distant Robert or, you know, and
it varies throughout the day as well...

1067
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:58,562
...but it's just hard because sometimes,
you know, it hits him harder.

1068
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:02,594
He'll have a rough night and then
that'll continue on throughout the day.

1069
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:06,870
You don't really take the world of
violence that you experienced in Iraq

1070
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:10,344
...and then replace it
with the world of being home...

1071
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:12,472
...you know,
the less violent world.

1072
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:15,077
You don't really replace it
because what happens is...

1073
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:17,517
...that you come home and
you're not the same person.

1074
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:20,613
So your world is gone and you
have to start from scratch, really...

1075
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,681
'cause you're
a totally different person.

1076
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:25,990
So the world is shattered.
And it's kind of...

1077
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:29,959
A lot of soldiers don't realize
the position that they're in.

1078
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:33,469
We've got our demons
to wrestle with now, and...

1079
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:39,264
It's easy. I try to stay so
busy, I think, sometimes where...

1080
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:43,369
And worrying about others
and the politics of it...

1081
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:47,849
...and the justifications for the war not
being there and this, that and the other...

1082
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:51,853
...so that I don't ever have
to stop and, like, and feel.

1083
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:01,989
So I don't have to deal
with my own demons.

1084
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:03,828
I think...

1085
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:07,630
...he doesn't understand
or realize that...

1086
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:12,502
...he probably most definitely has PTSD
and, you know, some of these things.

1087
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:16,102
And he's trying to help all
these other guys and talk to them.

1088
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:18,875
And I think
he needs to look at...

1089
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:23,180
"Hey, these are possibly
my traits...

1090
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:26,415
"and, you know,
what I have from this war."

1091
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:30,887
The common feeling is, you know,
you come home from the battlefield...

1092
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:35,021
...and, you know, this loved one
that's waited for you...

1093
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:38,829
...you know, you're just totally
disconnected with them.

1094
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:44,066
And I found myself totally disconnected
with Jackie when I first came home.

1095
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:47,132
But fortunately
Jackie was able to read up...

1096
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:51,306
...and was able to understand
about the effects of PTSD

1097
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:55,977
...and, you know, what it does to a human,
you know, what it does to a human being.

1098
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:58,179
I kept a journal
for a long time...

1099
01:00:58,254 --> 01:01:02,213
...trying to find a pattern
of what would set him off.

1100
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:05,920
You know,
was it something that I said?

1101
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:09,897
Was it something that I did? Was
it something that he saw on TV?

1102
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:13,697
Was it something, you know,
just didn't go his way?

1103
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:16,301
And it's not one thing
in particular.

1104
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:18,772
It's all those things
and more.

1105
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:22,740
RESTREPO: While you're
in the military, you're taught...

1106
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:24,939
...to know that
they're gonna take care of you...

1107
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:27,173
...as long as
you take care of them.

1108
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:30,481
As soon as they get out
and they start questioning...

1109
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:33,954
"Well, why is this institution
doing these things to me?

1110
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:38,187
"Why aren't they returning my phone
calls? Why aren't they filing my claims?"

1111
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:40,425
A lot of them have had
their wives divorce them.

1112
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:42,157
Their kids have been born
while they're gone.

1113
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:44,199
They've got a multitude
of issues to deal with.

1114
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:45,962
And then there's
the paperwork nightmare.

1115
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:48,196
You've got guys at Walter Reed
who've lost limbs...

1116
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:51,331
...and have to, you know, literally
wheel themselves around the campus...

1117
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:54,171
...to get their pay straightened out or
to get their compensation benefits.

1118
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:57,474
It's just, the amount of aggravation
that these guys have to deal with...

1119
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,378
...to get their life in order,
is ridiculous.

1120
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:02,885
JONES: They took a statement
from the unit I was attached to.

1121
01:02:02,952 --> 01:02:06,581
And that statement alone, I
suppose, was enough for them to say...

1122
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:10,251
...that my PTSD is...

1123
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:12,726
...as far as the Army goes,
is not related...

1124
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:16,492
...and they're not gonna put it on my
medical, on my physical evaluation board.

1125
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:20,024
Yeah, 120 days seemed to be
the only thing they knew about.

1126
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:24,733
I gave them the records in their hand.
They called me five times and said...

1127
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:28,642
"Can we just do this over the
phone?" And everything like that.

1128
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:31,271
I said, " No, no,
I have my medical information.

1129
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:33,178
"I'll bring it
and give it to you."

1130
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:36,275
I took the information down
there, put it in their hands...

1131
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:38,616
...and filled out
the paperwork and everything.

1132
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:42,522
And they said, "Okay, well good.
We'll call you in 120 days."

1133
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:45,126
I thought,
"What's up with these people?"

1134
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:47,788
You're gonna get better
in 120 days...

1135
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:51,925
...or maybe you'll go back to Iraq and we
won't have to deal with you in 120 days.

1136
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:54,492
120 days
is absolutely ridiculous.

1137
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:56,970
It's a good thing that
we didn't tell this country...

1138
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:00,839
Every soldier in this country, when
we got the call to deploy, didn't say...

1139
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:03,811
"Well, do you know what? Give me
120 days and I'll get back at you...

1140
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,974
"before we go make sure
that freedom's not paid for."

1141
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,980
What we are seeing is...

1142
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:16,157
...a Department of Defense that,
when the soldier comes back...

1143
01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:21,662
...if they have a psychological injury
or combat stress injury from war...

1144
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:24,430
...they are not
diagnosing that illness.

1145
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,992
What they are doing is calling
it a personality disorder...

1146
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:30,271
...or a bipolar disorder...

1147
01:03:30,439 --> 01:03:33,875
...or some other kind of disorder
that has nothing to do with combat.

1148
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:36,537
They tried to label me
with a personality disorder.

1149
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:38,273
I was like, " Okay, you know...

1150
01:03:38,347 --> 01:03:41,339
"I did three years of infantry
instructor at Parris Island...

1151
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:43,681
"three years of recruiting,
I'm a combat veteran...

1152
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:47,314
"and you're fucking telling me now
that I got a personality disorder?

1153
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,252
"Bullshit."

1154
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:51,057
But that's what's happening.

1155
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:54,585
They use the personality
disorder as a tool.

1156
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:58,896
It's just a tool that they can label you
with and then they're not held responsible.

1157
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:02,363
ELLIS: You know, these guys
that just got back...

1158
01:04:02,438 --> 01:04:04,133
...they came through and
we're talking to them today...

1159
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:05,868
...and they were
a great source of information.

1160
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:08,672
They said they were asked
when they were leaving Iraq...

1161
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:11,804
"Are you suffering from PTSD,
post-traumatic stress disorder?"

1162
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:14,975
If you answered yes,
yes, you stayed in-country.

1163
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:16,746
You didn't go home.

1164
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:20,947
And, you know, I talked to this
friend who's a veteran counselor...

1165
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:25,790
...that they really tightened up
on the medical benefits.

1166
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,092
You've got two years to
declare all your problems...

1167
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:29,631
...after you get
out of the service.

1168
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,224
If anything comes back,
you know, they don't want it.

1169
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:35,793
And we put everything that we are and
everything we ever will be on the line...

1170
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:38,697
...when our country asked us
to do so.

1171
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:44,313
And you don't expect
to be betrayed for that.

1172
01:04:44,513 --> 01:04:47,175
You expect them to fulfill
their commitment to you...

1173
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,980
...just like you don't hesitate
to fulfill it to them.

1174
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:53,647
The military is trying a new
policy, right now in this war...

1175
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:56,886
...where rather than evacuating
psychologically injured people...

1176
01:04:56,959 --> 01:04:59,086
...if they can treat them
there in Iraq...

1177
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:02,289
...and keep them with their unit,
they don't send them back.

1178
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:06,131
So we don't even know how many
psychologically injured there are.

1179
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:10,400
But the nature of war and
all the confounding factors...

1180
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:14,876
I believe, much as Vietnam
was Agent Orange...

1181
01:05:14,944 --> 01:05:18,038
...this war will be the
psychological injury of war.

1182
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,195
ACOSTA: This is my home.

1183
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,697
I grew up here and when
somebody welcomes me back...

1184
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,461
...it's just like, "Welcome
home," and you're just, like...

1185
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:40,058
"I am home."
You know, it's cool.

1186
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:42,036
Like, it feels good
when somebody says that.

1187
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:44,664
I'd rather have somebody say,
"Welcome home," than, "Thank you."

1188
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:48,571
If Americans actually listened to the
veterans that they claim to respect so much...

1189
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:50,373
...their attitude would change.

1190
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:54,382
But the thing is, Americans wanna honor
the veterans in, like, a very cursory way.

1191
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:57,146
You know, putting
a yellow sticker on their car...

1192
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:59,153
...having a little parade
or welcome back.

1193
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:01,212
But they don't wanna honor
the veterans by really, like...

1194
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:02,757
...listening to
what they have to say.

1195
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:06,386
I imagine that you have been kind
of inundated with all the talk...

1196
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:08,726
...about the body armor story that
was in the New York Times this week.

1197
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:12,564
We found out yesterday that there's
more information that's been revealed...

1198
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:16,002
...and now that the Department of
Defense took 167 days just to get...

1199
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:17,835
...the bulletproof vests ordered.
MADDOW: Right.

1200
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:22,742
Just to get them started, it took 167
days, and our allies, they took 12 days.

1201
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,440
Because they just called
the factory and ordered.

1202
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:29,211
Exactly, exactly. And that 167
days was during the insurgency.

1203
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:30,980
It was a time when people
were getting wounded...

1204
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:32,350
...and people
were getting killed.

1205
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:34,252
And body armor
could have saved lives.

1206
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,621
If you sat with me
and five guys in my squad...

1207
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:38,922
I could have told you about this
problem a year-and-a-half ago.

1208
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,587
It didn't need
congressional testimony...

1209
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,324
...it didn't need a New
York Times investigation.

1210
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:44,025
But all too often they listen
to the bureaucrats...

1211
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,328
...and they listen
to the four-star generals...

1212
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:47,198
...and the general comes and gives
them the thumbs-up and says...

1213
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:48,759
"Well, sir,
everything's great."

1214
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:52,433
I think that the only conduct
unbecoming for a non-commissioned officer...

1215
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:55,033
...in the United States
Marine Corps...

1216
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:57,409
...is if I identified
failed leadership...

1217
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,108
I identified misguided policy...

1218
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:03,410
...that resulted in the loss
of my Marines' lives...

1219
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:06,251
...and I didn't speak out
about it.

1220
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:07,812
That would be unbecoming.

1221
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:10,188
WOMAN: Hello? Hi, could I
speak with William, please?

1222
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:11,954
He's not in.
Can I take a message?

1223
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,461
Yes. Could you tell him
Chad called...

1224
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:15,394
...from the National Veterans
Foundation?

1225
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:17,796
All right, I sure will.
Thank you very much.

1226
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:21,064
The Army discharged him
while he was in jail.

1227
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:23,765
Brought his discharge papers
for him to sign in jail.

1228
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:26,808
Did absolutely nothing
to help him. Nothing.

1229
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:29,902
And now he's still getting
no help whatsoever.

1230
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:32,277
He has a bad conduct discharge...

1231
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:35,146
...even though it had nothing
to do with his military.

1232
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:37,811
And so he can't
receive benefits from the VA.

1233
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:41,618
Guys like me are gonna have to be the ones
that come out and start talking about it...

1234
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:43,920
...or nothing's gonna happen.

1235
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:45,824
You know, there's gonna be...

1236
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,420
Everybody is gonna be sitting
in their rooms...

1237
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:50,829
...afraid to come out
and get help.

1238
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:54,097
Part of healing
is to take action.

1239
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:58,640
So we encourage people to talk
about the problems that they see...

1240
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:01,636
...that they're experiencing, that
they see their friends experience...

1241
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:03,678
...and then to get involved.

1242
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:09,516
You know, people don't expect veterans
to be out there speaking out against war...

1243
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:12,315
...even though it turns out,
you know, that we're sometimes...

1244
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:15,755
...the most effective people out there to
talk about what really happens with war.

1245
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:18,953
I came home on leave halfway
through my tour in Iraq

1246
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:21,792
...and I decided that I couldn't
participate in the war.

1247
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:24,424
This was the first case
of any combat veteran...

1248
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,264
...to come back and go public
with his criticism about the war...

1249
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:29,167
...and the government
and the policies.

1250
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:32,639
So it became a political case and
the military responded politically...

1251
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:36,906
...and gave me a sentence
of one year in prison...

1252
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:41,211
...and a demotion to the lowest
rank and a bad conduct discharge.

1253
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:43,442
I ended up
doing nine months in jail.

1254
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:46,283
I got out three months early
because of good conduct...

1255
01:08:46,355 --> 01:08:49,518
...and ever since then
I have been an activist.

1256
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:53,221
'Cause it's strange go
from soldier to activist.

1257
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:55,263
Well, I mean, it's not
typical. I'll put it that way.

1258
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:58,629
And what I hope to do
is become a teacher.

1259
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:01,670
I think that might be some redemption
for me to be able to change...

1260
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:03,830
...to try to change
the next generation.

1261
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:06,807
O'BRIEN: Whenever I talk about
war, even in a theoretical way...

1262
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:09,401
...you know, I think, you know,
children with missing limbs...

1263
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:13,539
...you know, and there's a powerful
emotional connection that I have.

1264
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:17,211
I guess nothing's purely academic
for me anymore after being overseas.

1265
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:19,811
DOUGHERTY: Our men and women are
coming back and being abandoned...

1266
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:23,120
...by the same government that
says it's supporting the troops.

1267
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:26,794
And people are waiting months,
people are waiting over a year...

1268
01:09:26,862 --> 01:09:31,322
...for necessary mental and physical care
that because of the things they did...

1269
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,163
...the things they saw in Iraq.

1270
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:36,398
GOFF: For the Vietnam veterans who
are in this movement, the Iraq veterans...

1271
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,431
...are our children.

1272
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:40,168
Those are our kids.

1273
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:42,608
And that's exactly
how we feel about them.

1274
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:44,543
I mean, you know,
we're just in love with them.

1275
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:48,310
And the commitment they show
to one another is very moving.

1276
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:52,144
I think we feel this responsibility
that, like, we're speaking...

1277
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:55,247
...not only for ourselves, but for the
people who are still in the military...

1278
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:57,485
...who don't necessarily have
that freedom of speech.

1279
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:00,723
And I think that the opinion is
turning. I mean, the opinion polls...

1280
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:02,593
...are showing that
three-quarters of the troops...

1281
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:03,996
...want to return
within the year.

1282
01:10:04,066 --> 01:10:05,863
Those are troops in Iraq.

1283
01:10:05,935 --> 01:10:08,563
So they can no longer use this
rhetoric of "Support the troops."

1284
01:10:08,637 --> 01:10:11,970
Because what the troops are telling you,
both in Iraq and those who've returned...

1285
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:15,101
...is that they don't want any part
of this. They want to come home.

1286
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:21,207
MEJIA: It's amazing to come to New
Orleans and see the similarity between...

1287
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:24,514
...the level of devastation here
and in Iraq.

1288
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:29,124
The way that the government and
the corporations are behaving...

1289
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:32,592
...with total disregard for
human life and human interest.

1290
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:36,028
A lot of the things that are
happening in Iraq are happening here.

1291
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:37,395
ALL: You're right!

1292
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:40,094
When I came home and I realized
that I had to speak out...

1293
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:42,137
I also realized that...

1294
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:45,640
...having been to Iraq and
having been a part of that war...

1295
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,938
...gave me a platform
that I didn't have before.

1296
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:51,775
MULLINS: I'll never make
myself feel better...

1297
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:55,078
...about conforming
when I was in Iraq...

1298
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:57,846
...conforming when I was
in the military.

1299
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,548
But what I can do,
is do my part now.

1300
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:02,715
I wanted to go to college
so bad...

1301
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:06,416
...that I chose to put my life on
the line to join the military...

1302
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:09,191
...just to get that money,
those benefits.

1303
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:11,829
When I think about the deaths
of my comrades...

1304
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,232
...while I was in-country,
in Iraq...

1305
01:11:15,337 --> 01:11:16,929
I tried to think...

1306
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:18,840
I tried to tell myself...

1307
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:23,276
...well, I did at one point try to tell
myself that they died for a reason.

1308
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:27,281
But I couldn't find that reason.
I couldn't justify it in my mind.

1309
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:29,544
And that's why I'm here,
speaking out.

1310
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:32,212
I'm speaking out
because they can't speak out.

1311
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:37,055
I'm speaking out because
their voices are silenced.

1312
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:39,724
A lot of military service
is about duty.

1313
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:43,754
And I think, you know, there's a
sense of responsibility to fight...

1314
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:45,527
...that they instill in you
in the military.

1315
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:48,900
And we've kept that with us, you know,
and I think many of us are realizing...

1316
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,030
...that the military,
that wasn't our duty at all.

1317
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:53,973
That fight wasn't our fight.
This is now.

1318
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:57,440
There was no, nothing
honorable about what we did.

1319
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,041
And that's what
I always thought...

1320
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:04,609
...going to war and being a soldier,
you're some kind of a hero.

1321
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:07,383
And there was some stuff
that I did that was not...

1322
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:09,219
...even close to being a hero.

1323
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:11,759
You know, there's stuff
that I did, that was...

1324
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:13,419
Or that I saw...

1325
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:17,363
...you know, whatever it was, that
had nothing to do with honor...

1326
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:19,367
...you know, being honorable.

1327
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:21,699
Nothing to do with it.
And that broke my heart, yeah.

1328
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:24,437
When I was living
in Camp Lejeune...

1329
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:27,737
...my minister was
a really phenomenal man...

1330
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:30,005
...and he gave a sermon
on hope once.

1331
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,512
And he said that...

1332
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:39,318
...science has proven that you can live
approximately 72 hours without water...

1333
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:42,284
...around two weeks without food...

1334
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:46,588
...and spiritually we've proven you can
only live a few minutes without hope.

1335
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:51,388
If I didn't have hope that
this was going to end somehow...

1336
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:54,698
...that we were
going to be successful...

1337
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:58,729
...then I probably would have let myself
out of this life a long time ago.

1338
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:04,042
I don't know that I can let go of it
or if I can let myself off the hook.

1339
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:11,210
I know that to an extent that
that guilt fuels my fire right now.

1340
01:13:11,687 --> 01:13:15,282
That it... When they come at
me, when they try to quiet me...

1341
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:20,088
...it makes me rage that much
louder, it reinforces my resolve.

1342
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:26,467
And maybe I shouldn't be
let off the hook, you know.

1343
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:31,097
And maybe that's not the point of this
is for me to ever let myself off the hook.

1344
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:34,734
The point is to be wiser
and to learn from it.

1345
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:40,338
To the people, I just want
to say that I'm really sorry.

1346
01:13:48,657 --> 01:13:52,684
I'm really sorry for all the damage
and I am really sorry for my cowardice...

1347
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:54,956
...for not opposing the war...

1348
01:13:56,031 --> 01:14:01,196
...for not speaking out sooner, for
not disobeying more orders in Iraq.

1349
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:03,235
I'm sorry.

1350
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:07,000
And to the troops I want to
say that there is a way out.

1351
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:09,635
You know, we sign a contract
and, you know...

1352
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:12,179
...we swore
to protect the Constitution...

1353
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:16,047
...and to fight for freedom and democracy,
but that's not what we're doing in Iraq.

1354
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:23,182
And if it means jail, or if
it means disgrace or shame...

1355
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:28,023
...then that's what it's going to take, you
know, but there is a way out, you know.

1356
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:31,554
And I also wanna tell people
that after being in jail...

1357
01:14:32,601 --> 01:14:36,298
...that there is
no higher freedom...

1358
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:40,438
...that can be achieved than
the freedom we achieve when we...

1359
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:42,409
...follow our conscience.

1360
01:14:43,879 --> 01:14:47,542
And that's something that you
can live by and never regret.
