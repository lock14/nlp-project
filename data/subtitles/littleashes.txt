1
00:00:43,872 --> 00:00:45,822
<i>Dry land</i>

2
00:00:46,157 --> 00:00:48,605
<i>Quiet land of immense night</i>

3
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:51,828
<i>Wind in the olive grove</i>

4
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:53,714
<i>Wind in the Sierra</i>

5
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:03,053
<i>For Salvador Dali,
of the olive-colored voice</i>

6
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:22,618
Here we are, the three musketeers.

7
00:01:23,397 --> 00:01:24,743
Did you miss us?

8
00:01:25,817 --> 00:01:26,984
Luis Buñuel.

9
00:01:27,565 --> 00:01:30,551
It's Louie this term.
More chic, don't you think?

10
00:01:32,907 --> 00:01:33,647
Published?

11
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,125
I signed it for you.

12
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,461
And he would never have managed it
without your supportive comments.

13
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:41,404
He's waisting his education with bad
company in disreputable night clubs.

14
00:01:41,987 --> 00:01:45,757
My parents were so pleased.
Thank you sir, thank you so much.

15
00:01:56,426 --> 00:01:58,236
<i>The soul of the west wind</i>

16
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,093
- Just say what you want to say, Louie.
- What?

17
00:02:04,846 --> 00:02:08,671
I was having a lovely time reading about
all the butterflies and thrills...

18
00:02:09,243 --> 00:02:11,270
Oh, look! Here's God!

19
00:02:12,953 --> 00:02:15,323
It's just a bit... andalusian.

20
00:02:16,697 --> 00:02:17,749
I am andalusian.

21
00:02:18,058 --> 00:02:19,320
You know what I mean.

22
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:20,987
You think it's bad.

23
00:02:21,143 --> 00:02:24,053
No, not the writing. The writing is
bloody good.

24
00:02:24,262 --> 00:02:25,971
It's the subject.

25
00:02:26,078 --> 00:02:30,825
What does Federico García Lorca feel
about all this bloody butterflies?

26
00:02:31,055 --> 00:02:32,156
What makes him angry?

27
00:02:32,497 --> 00:02:33,831
What turns him on?

28
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:38,335
Oh, come on. Don't be such a prude.

29
00:02:38,857 --> 00:02:40,408
I am trying to be constructive here.

30
00:04:40,173 --> 00:04:42,962
... the other flag in between her leg...

31
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,186
... and waived the flag...

32
00:04:46,563 --> 00:04:48,232
... it was a victory for...

33
00:06:30,904 --> 00:06:33,563
Holding all this brilliance isn't very
neighbourly, you know?

34
00:06:35,546 --> 00:06:36,247
Name?

35
00:06:37,382 --> 00:06:40,239
Salvador Felipe Jacinto Dalí Domenech.

36
00:06:40,812 --> 00:06:41,574
Studying?

37
00:06:42,685 --> 00:06:43,685
Fine art.

38
00:06:44,702 --> 00:06:45,563
Clearly.

39
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,108
Interests?

40
00:06:47,735 --> 00:06:48,569
Affiliations?

41
00:06:51,017 --> 00:06:54,413
Only dada, anarchy and the
construction of genius.

42
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,503
Whose genius?

43
00:06:57,105 --> 00:06:57,958
My own.

44
00:06:59,106 --> 00:06:59,979
Bravo.

45
00:07:01,586 --> 00:07:02,469
Luis Buñuel.

46
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:04,232
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

47
00:07:06,913 --> 00:07:08,052
Excuse me for a moment.

48
00:07:11,268 --> 00:07:13,973
Private view at number seven!

49
00:07:14,859 --> 00:07:15,675
Where is everyone? Come on!

50
00:07:20,693 --> 00:07:21,819
This here... Sergio.

51
00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:29,977
Pechuga. Like it?

52
00:07:31,352 --> 00:07:33,819
Ah, look! A strategically placed
copy of Freud.

53
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:37,885
Very good, very good, my friend.

54
00:08:01,503 --> 00:08:03,662
That's Federico, resident poet.

55
00:08:04,537 --> 00:08:06,021
García Lorca.

56
00:08:07,765 --> 00:08:10,013
He's famous.
- Really?

57
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:12,110
I wonder if he knows.

58
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:14,709
Come on, let's tell him. Federico!

59
00:08:15,242 --> 00:08:19,305
My new discovery. Salvador, may I
introduce you to resident poet,

60
00:08:20,548 --> 00:08:24,256
playwriter and another self-titled genius,
Federico García Lorca.

61
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:26,316
We've met.

62
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,818
You're a cubist.

63
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:31,643
No.

64
00:08:32,535 --> 00:08:34,027
This is cubist.

65
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:38,294
You're going to be something else?

66
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:40,684
I'm putting together a magazine.

67
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,421
Would you let us have this
for the cover?

68
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:52,689
She is beautiful.

69
00:08:54,976 --> 00:08:56,084
She's dead.

70
00:08:57,775 --> 00:08:59,642
Federico, where have you been?

71
00:08:59,677 --> 00:09:01,079
Have you met Paco?

72
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:04,253
- Hours ago.
- What have you been doing?

73
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,594
Trying to find a subject.

74
00:09:07,537 --> 00:09:09,764
Louie thinks I'm a danger of
becoming bourgeois.

75
00:09:09,938 --> 00:09:12,290
Well, you've read the poems, apparently.
What do you think?

76
00:09:13,674 --> 00:09:15,042
I like them.

77
00:09:15,118 --> 00:09:17,715
Of course you like them, everybody
likes them.

78
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:21,747
I just think you should write about
something modern. Something politics or...

79
00:09:22,124 --> 00:09:24,860
...the decapitation of the putrid priest
in Zaragoza or...

80
00:09:25,386 --> 00:09:26,170
Come on!

81
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,928
- Eiffel tower.
- Sex!

82
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,191
- Aeroplanes.
- Anything! Everything! Nothing!

83
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:46,422
A recent acquisition?

84
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:48,828
Salvador Felipe Jacinto Dalí Domenech.

85
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,046
Catchy.

86
00:09:50,547 --> 00:09:52,882
New, but showing considerate promise.

87
00:09:53,574 --> 00:09:55,743
This is Adella.

88
00:09:57,267 --> 00:09:59,480
Federico the Famous,
where are the drinks?

89
00:10:03,911 --> 00:10:04,747
Federico!

90
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:09,433
Your hair!

91
00:10:09,935 --> 00:10:11,847
- It's gone.
- It's wonderful.

92
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:17,903
I'm very shocking, apparently, because my
grandfather refuses to let me in the house.

93
00:10:18,303 --> 00:10:20,162
Quite right. I wouldn't.

94
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,628
I've missed you.

95
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:29,244
The holidays were terrible! There was no one
here, nothing to regret!

96
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,494
I read 80 books!

97
00:10:31,746 --> 00:10:32,737
80?

98
00:10:33,522 --> 00:10:34,519
40.

99
00:10:35,806 --> 00:10:37,062
10, actually.

100
00:10:38,326 --> 00:10:39,757
I've missed you, too.

101
00:10:43,828 --> 00:10:45,830
This is Salvador.

102
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:49,482
He's just arrived. He's a painter,
a very good one.

103
00:10:49,954 --> 00:10:53,116
Well, ain't we lucky to have you.

104
00:11:05,383 --> 00:11:07,142
Champagne!

105
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:09,928
You all live like kings!

106
00:11:10,632 --> 00:11:13,848
Surely, you're not suggesting
we live like students.

107
00:11:15,918 --> 00:11:17,238
Magdalena is a writer.

108
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:19,188
At the women's college.

109
00:11:19,748 --> 00:11:21,209
- What do you write?
- I didn't tell you, did I?

110
00:11:21,976 --> 00:11:23,022
I'm getting an apartment!

111
00:11:23,456 --> 00:11:25,716
How will you ever get your parents to
agree to that?

112
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:27,175
By not telling them.

113
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:30,599
All lies are elaborate deceptions.

114
00:11:30,844 --> 00:11:32,306
Anyone got a match?

115
00:11:33,205 --> 00:11:35,127
Spain is rotting from the inside.

116
00:11:35,186 --> 00:11:38,497
Fated monarchy crash and dement our
religious culture

117
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:41,672
Something has to give.. Look at
Russia!

118
00:11:41,945 --> 00:11:43,499
Look at Paris!

119
00:11:44,655 --> 00:11:47,623
Dance, my dove.
- I thought you'd never ask.

120
00:12:10,628 --> 00:12:12,889
Manuel de Torre.

121
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:16,865
Great artist of the * idiot* people.

122
00:12:17,332 --> 00:12:19,627
Once told a singer

123
00:12:20,722 --> 00:12:22,324
<i>You have a voice</i>

124
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,177
<i>You know the styles</i>

125
00:12:28,354 --> 00:12:30,347
<i>But you will never triumph in your art</i>

126
00:12:31,122 --> 00:12:33,584
<i>Because you have no...
'Duende.'</i>

127
00:12:34,997 --> 00:12:37,524
<i>A passion, on the very edge
of life and death.</i>

128
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:43,714
Everywhere else in the world, death comes
and they draw the curtains.

129
00:12:44,969 --> 00:12:46,421
But not in Spain.

130
00:12:47,304 --> 00:12:52,643
In Spain... They open them.

131
00:12:57,164 --> 00:12:58,489
And I tell you this.

132
00:12:59,616 --> 00:13:03,395
There is no beginning and we do not
tremble.

133
00:13:04,904 --> 00:13:06,890
We are not sentimental.

134
00:13:08,141 --> 00:13:13,629
Like a furious wind, we rip at the fabric
of clouds and prayers.

135
00:13:14,802 --> 00:13:18,750
And we shape an epic spectacle.

136
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:24,364
Of disaster, fire and decomposition.

137
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:27,479
- Ideal, ideal, ideal.
- Knowledge, knowledge, knowledge!

138
00:13:33,794 --> 00:13:38,498
Dada! Now, that is what I call poetry.

139
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:45,680
Yes, you know when I took the exam
for our art college..

140
00:13:45,705 --> 00:13:50,016
...I worked for three days on the drawing
and then I erased it.

141
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:56,158
And I had one hour to get it right, just
imagine - one hour...

142
00:13:56,286 --> 00:13:58,399
.. and I gave it to our professors..

143
00:13:58,891 --> 00:14:01,577
... and they said "This painting..."...

144
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:04,447
... "This painting, Salvador, it's"...

145
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,479
No, no... Don't worry.

146
00:14:13,841 --> 00:14:17,446
They told me, this painting...

147
00:14:17,928 --> 00:14:19,664
"It's perfect."

148
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:29,142
Whose idea was this?

149
00:14:29,946 --> 00:14:32,231
Federico's.
- No. He's your discovery.

150
00:14:40,164 --> 00:14:42,441
Faggots!

151
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:46,848
Better hide! They're coming
to get you!

152
00:14:51,072 --> 00:14:53,879
They should be more careful.

153
00:14:54,257 --> 00:14:56,396
The boys are starting a gang,
do you know?

154
00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:00,393
Going to clean things up!

155
00:15:01,774 --> 00:15:03,198
Thinking of joining them?

156
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:08,117
I prefer to see the marricones
locked away.

157
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,572
He'll freeze.

158
00:15:51,706 --> 00:15:54,009
I can't stay here much longer, Federico.

159
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,962
Can't breathe.

160
00:15:57,341 --> 00:16:00,226
We should be in Paris, mon ami.

161
00:16:00,514 --> 00:16:03,594
You can write, I can work
in a film studio...

162
00:16:03,822 --> 00:16:05,966
I thought you wanted to be
an entomologist.

163
00:16:06,076 --> 00:16:07,465
That was last term.

164
00:16:07,878 --> 00:16:09,459
And what about the boxing?

165
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:11,570
I've always been persisten
about Paris.

166
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:18,331
Well, anyway...

167
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:20,332
I don't speak French.

168
00:16:20,596 --> 00:16:21,866
I'll buy you a book.

169
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,120
I can't leave Spain, Louie.

170
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,183
Why not?

171
00:16:33,465 --> 00:16:35,487
I hate new shoes.

172
00:16:39,114 --> 00:16:42,450
When I was a boy, in the Vega...
In the south...

173
00:16:46,693 --> 00:16:49,340
There was some trouble in a village
near our house

174
00:16:51,352 --> 00:16:52,749
There was always something.

175
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:58,402
But the next thing we heard...
The Civil Guard...

176
00:16:58,454 --> 00:17:00,396
... had killed them all.

177
00:17:01,006 --> 00:17:02,490
The whole village.

178
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,084
And I remember these carts,
full of bodies...

179
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:10,077
All of the people laid out...

180
00:17:10,726 --> 00:17:12,195
... feet close together.

181
00:17:13,506 --> 00:17:15,010
Shiny shoes.

182
00:17:15,773 --> 00:17:17,446
As if they were resting.

183
00:17:19,977 --> 00:17:22,041
And sometimes, when I think about it...

184
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:25,573
... it's as if everything around me,
all the people...

185
00:17:26,683 --> 00:17:28,301
... and the buildings...

186
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,227
...and the animals...

187
00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:33,920
They are like pieces of cotton.

188
00:17:36,696 --> 00:17:38,735
And they just float away.

189
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:42,659
And I'm alone.

190
00:17:44,308 --> 00:17:45,863
And that...

191
00:17:47,372 --> 00:17:48,544
...when I hear it...

192
00:17:50,997 --> 00:17:52,091
Death.

193
00:17:54,392 --> 00:17:56,670
Breathing behind of the wall.

194
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,725
Death, rising up from my
new shoes.

195
00:18:04,386 --> 00:18:08,837
And there is nothing left... but the
grass and the grey sky.

196
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:12,834
Now you tell me, Louie...

197
00:18:13,155 --> 00:18:15,382
... are those French thoughts?

198
00:19:35,738 --> 00:19:38,541
This fucking country!
I tell you, Federico, it breaks my heart.

199
00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:40,491
I know.

200
00:19:41,391 --> 00:19:42,841
This is why you must come with me.

201
00:19:42,842 --> 00:19:45,229
We have to be free to make
a difference to the world.

202
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,769
What difference are you going to make
in a free country?

203
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:51,023
The difference needs to be made here.

204
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:58,521
- Sensational.
- Incredible.

205
00:20:00,105 --> 00:20:01,998
The girls will go crazy.

206
00:20:02,746 --> 00:20:03,906
I expect so.

207
00:20:04,054 --> 00:20:05,495
You don't do any sports, do you?

208
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:09,956
I run most things.
Track, boxing...

209
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:11,736
Fencing?

210
00:20:12,097 --> 00:20:13,552
Don't stretch a lot, I'm afraid.

211
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:14,742
But, listen...

212
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:18,511
I'm a part of this underground movement,
might be interesting for you - ultraism.

213
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:22,257
We keep a low profile, wouldn't want
information getting into the wrong hands.

214
00:20:22,352 --> 00:20:24,729
Now come or we'll miss it!
- Where are we going?

215
00:20:25,251 --> 00:20:28,125
- Puppet show.
- A non-senzac puppet show.

216
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:45,097
They complain to me about democracy...

217
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,042
Ridiculous.

218
00:20:48,744 --> 00:20:51,821
Everyone in this city lives
in perfect liberty.

219
00:20:53,515 --> 00:20:55,670
Every single man and woman.

220
00:20:55,806 --> 00:20:56,940
Although...

221
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:58,106
Of course...

222
00:20:58,128 --> 00:21:02,659
Women are free too, but in a slightly
different way.

223
00:21:04,103 --> 00:21:05,671
Look at the peasants.

224
00:21:06,035 --> 00:21:11,130
Why, I'd cut off my own leg to have half
as much liberty as the peasants.

225
00:21:11,832 --> 00:21:14,245
Just think, if the harvest is good...

226
00:21:14,294 --> 00:21:17,518
... they're free to give up over half their
crop for taxes...

227
00:21:17,882 --> 00:21:23,435
If the harvest is bad, why, they and their
family are completely free...

228
00:21:23,634 --> 00:21:25,228
... to starve to death.

229
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:37,757
Holy Mother, forgive me, I have sinned.
I have had impure thoughts.

230
00:21:37,891 --> 00:21:40,530
Help me to resist temptation.

231
00:22:21,414 --> 00:22:24,952
So, once more - forget the rules!

232
00:22:25,392 --> 00:22:28,879
There is no science to art.
Feel the drawing!

233
00:22:29,065 --> 00:22:33,503
Interpret... Interpret and then draw
exactly what you see.

234
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:39,636
See with your soul... See what you feel...
Express... Express...

235
00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:03,369
Mr. Dalí! Mr. Dalí!

236
00:23:04,366 --> 00:23:07,280
So... They won't publish me.

237
00:23:08,065 --> 00:23:11,743
They won't publish me unless I get
a male penname.

238
00:23:12,103 --> 00:23:14,515
I said to them, "I've got a name for you..."

239
00:23:14,903 --> 00:23:17,121
"Pope bloody Joan"

240
00:23:17,556 --> 00:23:21,141
They were so apologetic, so embarassed...

241
00:23:21,803 --> 00:23:26,629
"Miss Merra, if it were up to us, we'd hire
you on the spot, but the public college,

242
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:29,131
to make a woman write and think about politics...
because of course...

243
00:23:29,653 --> 00:23:34,218
I should be at home, cooking for my
9 fat children and my impotent husband.

244
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,742
It's just so frustrating, Federico.

245
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,210
You could use my name,
as a penname.

246
00:23:42,405 --> 00:23:44,370
If it would help.

247
00:23:45,221 --> 00:23:48,482
That's probably the best offer anyone is
ever likely to make me, but...

248
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:51,462
... I refuse to give into that bullying.

249
00:23:51,767 --> 00:23:55,382
I'll send them 20 letters a week, I'll
come to their offices...

250
00:23:55,706 --> 00:23:59,029
- Really... - You've forgotten your
hat. - And that's another thing...

251
00:23:59,383 --> 00:24:01,501
I despise hats!
- Listen...

252
00:24:02,076 --> 00:24:03,794
You don't need hats.

253
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:10,090
Come on. Let's get this thing over with.

254
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:13,301
Isn't that Salvador?

255
00:24:13,981 --> 00:24:15,926
Salvador!

256
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,852
Can I have a look?

257
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,725
- It's an experiment in perception.
- I see.

258
00:24:38,454 --> 00:24:39,497
It's fascinating.

259
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,696
It's yours.

260
00:24:42,004 --> 00:24:44,222
No, no, no.
I couldn't.

261
00:24:44,937 --> 00:24:47,133
No, please. I insist.

262
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:48,581
Thanks.

263
00:24:49,261 --> 00:24:52,267
I'll... I'll have it framed.

264
00:24:53,822 --> 00:24:55,410
So, where are you going?

265
00:24:56,564 --> 00:25:02,949
Federico is being very kind in agreeing to suffer
an evening of boring music and horrible company.

266
00:25:03,582 --> 00:25:08,031
My aunt's giving one of her legendarily dull
dinner parties. You must come!

267
00:25:08,944 --> 00:25:09,291
No.

268
00:25:09,292 --> 00:25:13,598
Yes! It's vital for my aunt
to know people like Salvador.

269
00:25:13,782 --> 00:25:15,180
You could show her you picture.

270
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,931
But, you said it yourself,
it's going to be so boring...

271
00:25:18,372 --> 00:25:21,441
We don't want to subject poor Salvador.
- No, no, I...

272
00:25:22,045 --> 00:25:25,633
... I'd love to.
- You see? He'd love to come!

273
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:33,395
Magdalena.

274
00:25:34,468 --> 00:25:37,341
What have you done to your hair?

275
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:41,515
These are my friends, I'm going to
powder my nose...

276
00:25:44,014 --> 00:25:45,223
Federico García Lorca.

277
00:25:46,282 --> 00:25:50,735
- I'm so glad you could come.
- It's so kind of you to invite me.

278
00:25:51,575 --> 00:25:55,611
There are some very interesting people
for you to meet.

279
00:25:56,394 --> 00:26:01,066
Fernadno de Gavalle and, of course,
you must know señor Milagro.

280
00:26:01,531 --> 00:26:04,676
Magdalena's been talking about you
for so long...

281
00:26:04,945 --> 00:26:08,962
I had begun to wonder whether you
were another one of her inventions.

282
00:26:08,963 --> 00:26:09,765
Oh, no, no.

283
00:26:10,772 --> 00:26:15,577
Let me introduce you to... Salvador Dalí.
- How do you do?

284
00:26:16,321 --> 00:26:19,540
I'm trying to get very drunk,
thank you very much.

285
00:26:19,636 --> 00:26:21,532
I think soon I might be sick.

286
00:26:21,886 --> 00:26:24,264
You must be another writer?

287
00:26:24,815 --> 00:26:27,659
- No, Salvador is one of Madrid's famous painters.
- Oh.

288
00:26:29,008 --> 00:26:31,244
I recently escaped from prison.

289
00:26:32,161 --> 00:26:33,329
From prison?

290
00:26:34,838 --> 00:26:38,692
31 days of absolute incarceration.

291
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,974
I found it, I find it very inspiring.

292
00:26:42,202 --> 00:26:48,531
How do you feel about communal defecation?
And the whiffles?

293
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:53,706
So tremendously beneficial
for the complexion...

294
00:26:53,727 --> 00:26:58,114
He's upseting you, isn't he?
Come on, Salvador.

295
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:00,354
Is it time for my bed, mother?

296
00:27:05,196 --> 00:27:06,765
Do excuse us.

297
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,578
Fact remains, that these people
are not few people...

298
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,745
They come over here,
living of our charity, stealing...

299
00:27:34,062 --> 00:27:37,991
It is essential to have a unformed
approach to the gypsies.

300
00:27:38,736 --> 00:27:41,767
Restore a certain autonomy
to the Civil Guard.

301
00:27:42,497 --> 00:27:44,277
Who are those unbearable men?

302
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:48,624
The one that looks more
like a pig is señor Milagro.

303
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,655
The other one is Fernando Gavalle.

304
00:27:52,327 --> 00:27:53,974
Why do I know the name?

305
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:56,930
He's a little *idiot* from Madrid.
- Oh, my God!

306
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:01,782
Senor García Lorca, you are from the
south, I believe?

307
00:28:02,134 --> 00:28:03,036
Yes.

308
00:28:03,072 --> 00:28:06,971
Well, then, you know better than anyone
what we are talking about here.

309
00:28:07,234 --> 00:28:13,685
And the youngest is 17 and she is engaged to
one of the Montana brothers...

310
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:19,308
Bravo, bravo! Superb.
Superb!

311
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:23,728
Oh, how avangard!

312
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,820
Simply superb.

313
00:28:27,209 --> 00:28:28,890
How dare you?

314
00:28:31,101 --> 00:28:32,818
How dare I?

315
00:28:33,603 --> 00:28:37,789
How dare you, sir? Then you clearly don't know
who I am. I am Salvador Dalí!

316
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:39,719
The saviour of modern art.

317
00:28:40,962 --> 00:28:44,723
And this man is a genius.

318
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:46,610
He's a great poet.

319
00:28:46,764 --> 00:28:49,830
Aren't we honoured, ladies and gentlemen?

320
00:28:49,865 --> 00:28:54,403
Saviour of modern art and his friend,
great poet.

321
00:28:54,684 --> 00:28:56,344
Recite something.

322
00:28:56,623 --> 00:28:58,224
No.

323
00:28:58,411 --> 00:29:00,376
Oh, yes, do.

324
00:29:00,842 --> 00:29:01,868
I'm sorry.

325
00:29:02,143 --> 00:29:03,752
I don't have anything.

326
00:29:04,058 --> 00:29:06,225
- Go on.
- It's not suitable.

327
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:09,537
Federico. Fuck suitable.

328
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,919
Well, come on then, great poet.

329
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,588
Sing for your supper.

330
00:29:28,947 --> 00:29:30,781
<i>Oh city of the gypsies</i>

331
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,371
<i>Who could see you and not remember you</i>

332
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:36,496
<i>City of musk and sorrow</i>

333
00:29:36,682 --> 00:29:38,436
<i>City of cinnamon towers</i>

334
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:42,023
<i>Oh, city of the gypsies</i>

335
00:29:42,058 --> 00:29:43,877
<i>Corners hung with flags</i>

336
00:29:44,923 --> 00:29:47,044
<i>Put your green lights out</i>

337
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,763
<i>The Civil Guard is coming</i>

338
00:29:51,219 --> 00:29:53,626
<i>The city, free of fear</i>

339
00:29:53,802 --> 00:29:55,690
<i>Was multiplying doors</i>

340
00:29:56,232 --> 00:29:58,107
<i>Forty Civil guardsmen</i>

341
00:29:58,142 --> 00:30:00,577
<i>Pour through to sack and burn</i>

342
00:30:01,757 --> 00:30:05,695
<i>Flight of long screams rose
from the weathercocks.</i>

343
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:11,237
<i>Sabre slashed the breezes
trampled under hoof</i>

344
00:30:14,671 --> 00:30:17,432
<i>Through the half-lit streets</i>

345
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:19,247
<i>Old gypsy women</i>

346
00:30:19,282 --> 00:30:20,519
<i>Flee</i>

347
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,548
<i>With their sleepy horses</i>

348
00:30:22,557 --> 00:30:24,862
<i>And enormous jars of coins</i>

349
00:30:25,569 --> 00:30:29,782
<i>Up the steep streets
climbed the sinister capes</i>

350
00:30:30,591 --> 00:30:33,710
<i>Leaving behind them brief
whirlwinds of shears</i>

351
00:30:36,495 --> 00:30:41,308
<i>Oh, city of the gypsies!
The Civil guardsmen ride away</i>

352
00:30:41,774 --> 00:30:43,734
<i>Through a tunnel of silence</i>

353
00:30:45,047 --> 00:30:48,517
<i>While the flames encircle you</i>

354
00:31:08,012 --> 00:31:09,529
Let's get out of here, hm?

355
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,387
Viva la revolucion!

356
00:31:52,407 --> 00:31:57,998
Federico, when I saw you at the dinner...
When you read your poem...

357
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:02,400
I saw what you really are.

358
00:32:05,061 --> 00:32:07,830
You're... Raw.

359
00:32:08,514 --> 00:32:11,183
Like some animal that's been skinned.

360
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,066
So, what's she like?

361
00:32:20,294 --> 00:32:21,295
Who?

362
00:32:23,269 --> 00:32:24,933
Magdalena, you know.

363
00:32:25,697 --> 00:32:26,842
No.

364
00:32:27,244 --> 00:32:28,033
What?

365
00:32:31,304 --> 00:32:32,399
What about with other girls?

366
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:33,944
Oh.

367
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:37,036
You mean...
- Yeah.

368
00:32:38,551 --> 00:32:41,933
Not with Magdalena, but back home...

369
00:32:42,975 --> 00:32:43,763
Really?

370
00:32:44,367 --> 00:32:45,680
Haven't you?

371
00:32:48,915 --> 00:32:50,074
I've had a few.

372
00:32:59,254 --> 00:33:03,068
All the institutions that prop up this corrupt
regime must be dismount!

373
00:33:04,523 --> 00:33:06,579
I just think it sounds a bit extreme.

374
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:09,899
But it has to be extreme, Paco.
It has to be complete revolution!

375
00:33:10,009 --> 00:33:12,136
All the churches, all the palaces!

376
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,864
You know, when I was small...

377
00:33:16,383 --> 00:33:19,069
There was this ruined tower near our house,
in Cadaques.

378
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:20,902
You'll see it when you come.

379
00:33:21,812 --> 00:33:22,999
I'm coming?

380
00:33:24,467 --> 00:33:26,086
Of course, with the holidays...

381
00:33:28,345 --> 00:33:29,997
You must come.

382
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:32,843
I would sit in this tower and I draw,
draw and draw.

383
00:33:33,658 --> 00:33:35,060
I never came down.

384
00:33:35,703 --> 00:33:39,488
Just imagine this little shrimp of a child,
half-starved, covered in piss.

385
00:33:40,861 --> 00:33:43,775
And I wouldn't come down in
the winter, in the summer.

386
00:33:43,776 --> 00:33:46,901
In the freezing cold, I'd fill
this iron tub with water...

387
00:33:47,995 --> 00:33:49,564
I'd sit in it for days.

388
00:33:50,509 --> 00:33:55,189
It's even then I realized that if I'm going
to be anything more than...

389
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:59,233
... than average, if anyone is going to
remember me...

390
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:02,743
... then I need to go further in everything.

391
00:34:02,975 --> 00:34:04,926
In art. In life.

392
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:10,615
And everything that they think is real,
morality, immorality, good, bad...

393
00:34:11,764 --> 00:34:15,284
I... We have to smash that to pieces.

394
00:34:15,684 --> 00:34:17,271
And we have to go beyond that.

395
00:34:18,731 --> 00:34:20,917
We have to be brave, Federico.

396
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:25,303
No limit.

397
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,998
No, no limit.

398
00:34:33,254 --> 00:34:34,305
What do you think you're doing?

399
00:34:34,749 --> 00:34:35,802
What?

400
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:38,485
I saw you. I bloody saw you!

401
00:34:38,714 --> 00:34:39,893
You had your hand on her leg!

402
00:34:40,831 --> 00:34:41,999
Are you denying that?

403
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:49,059
Get off me! I can fight my own battles!

404
00:35:53,335 --> 00:35:54,326
Federico.

405
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:56,576
No.

406
00:36:54,596 --> 00:36:55,422
Look.

407
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:06,794
It's beautiful.

408
00:39:28,829 --> 00:39:31,264
I've never seen anything like this before.

409
00:39:32,968 --> 00:39:35,587
It has all the tones of Tangi, but...

410
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,132
I think it's something new.

411
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,175
It's extraordinary.

412
00:39:45,173 --> 00:39:46,460
Me!

413
00:39:48,684 --> 00:39:50,988
You can name it, if you want.

414
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,657
"Little Ashes".

415
00:39:57,137 --> 00:40:02,431
Because you can paint us into hundred pictures.
And in eighty years time...

416
00:40:02,862 --> 00:40:04,499
We'll still be dust.

417
00:40:09,683 --> 00:40:12,245
We'll still be in the pictures.

418
00:40:12,513 --> 00:40:13,305
Not us.

419
00:40:13,643 --> 00:40:16,599
We'll be echoes of ourselves.

420
00:40:16,635 --> 00:40:17,844
Ghosts.

421
00:40:19,737 --> 00:40:21,874
And I don't want to be a ghost.

422
00:40:24,032 --> 00:40:25,953
Come with me to Granada.

423
00:40:26,981 --> 00:40:27,966
I can't.

424
00:40:28,018 --> 00:40:30,490
You'll see my family, my home.

425
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,363
Everything I am.

426
00:40:37,613 --> 00:40:40,119
I see you now, Federico.

427
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:07,921
<i>The afternoon gone mad
with figs and heated sounds</i>

428
00:41:13,702 --> 00:41:17,722
<i>Falls upon the rider's wounded thighs.</i>

429
00:41:21,134 --> 00:41:24,888
<i>Black angels were flying
on the western breeze.</i>

430
00:41:28,659 --> 00:41:33,459
<i>Angels with long braids and hearts
of soothing oil.</i>

431
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,556
Good night.

432
00:45:00,022 --> 00:45:01,309
Good night.

433
00:46:28,694 --> 00:46:29,613
Salvador.

434
00:46:30,225 --> 00:46:34,534
I think of you and I've never thought
more intensly in my life.

435
00:46:35,739 --> 00:46:37,761
Since our time together...

436
00:46:37,913 --> 00:46:40,465
... everything I am has been split apart.

437
00:46:40,483 --> 00:46:44,494
I write in a way that I've never
thought possible.

438
00:46:45,892 --> 00:46:48,548
My pen scratches the surface
of things.

439
00:46:48,685 --> 00:46:52,352
The masks... And then it goes
beyond them.

440
00:46:52,832 --> 00:46:54,601
Right down to the bones.

441
00:46:54,929 --> 00:46:58,744
Downt to the dark, cold jelly in the
marrow.

442
00:47:03,874 --> 00:47:04,949
Federico.

443
00:47:05,787 --> 00:47:07,559
From the day you left...

444
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:09,952
... I've been in the studio day and night.

445
00:47:10,664 --> 00:47:13,149
I started to work on designs for
your play.

446
00:47:13,895 --> 00:47:15,743
I'm doing them gypsy-style.

447
00:47:15,871 --> 00:47:17,114
Andalusian.

448
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:18,447
Like you.

449
00:47:19,563 --> 00:47:21,917
The unconscious mind, Federico...

450
00:47:22,033 --> 00:47:24,412
... it rises like a beast within me.

451
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:27,866
I let it speak and it produces such
wonders.

452
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:33,856
It's true.

453
00:47:33,891 --> 00:47:36,171
I touch sea bottom in myself.

454
00:47:36,801 --> 00:47:38,590
And my poems write themselves.

455
00:47:38,713 --> 00:47:41,393
I am, just as you said...

456
00:47:41,455 --> 00:47:42,192
Raw.

457
00:47:42,216 --> 00:47:43,408
Bloody.

458
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:44,515
Alive.

459
00:47:44,889 --> 00:47:47,224
And I, too, want to be alive.

460
00:48:27,644 --> 00:48:29,020
How did you get in?

461
00:48:32,407 --> 00:48:33,833
I stole your key.

462
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,610
It's going to look superb.

463
00:48:41,399 --> 00:48:44,763
No.
It will be superb.

464
00:48:46,126 --> 00:48:51,561
After Barcelona, we should take it to London and
Paris and then New York.

465
00:48:52,394 --> 00:48:53,628
Why not?

466
00:48:54,733 --> 00:48:56,804
No limits.

467
00:49:00,361 --> 00:49:02,191
So why did you come back so early?

468
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:09,479
You know what you said in your letter?

469
00:49:10,764 --> 00:49:17,212
About everything that you
are being split apart?

470
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:39,161
Louie.

471
00:49:39,196 --> 00:49:41,090
What an amazing surprise.

472
00:49:42,134 --> 00:49:43,402
What are you talking about?

473
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:46,281
I didn't know when you'll be getting back.

474
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,826
You didn't say when you were coming.

475
00:49:48,881 --> 00:49:50,260
Are you feeling alright?

476
00:49:51,566 --> 00:49:53,421
Salutations, Mr. Dalí.

477
00:49:55,461 --> 00:49:56,816
Sit down, sit down.

478
00:49:57,412 --> 00:49:59,108
Would you like some tea?

479
00:50:01,324 --> 00:50:03,129
Your look.

480
00:50:03,258 --> 00:50:03,879
Sorry?

481
00:50:08,812 --> 00:50:09,718
What are these?

482
00:50:11,637 --> 00:50:14,231
Set designs for Mariana Pineda.
You know, my play.

483
00:50:14,817 --> 00:50:16,080
To be performed?

484
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:18,965
In Barcelona. Salvador's father got us
a producer.

485
00:50:20,411 --> 00:50:22,313
That's... excellent news.

486
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,792
You're doing the sets?

487
00:50:25,012 --> 00:50:26,565
Nothing wrong with that, is there?

488
00:50:27,575 --> 00:50:29,374
I didn't say there was.

489
00:50:37,012 --> 00:50:39,300
How's my new screenplay coming?

490
00:50:44,173 --> 00:50:45,253
My short film.

491
00:50:45,338 --> 00:50:47,037
The one I asked you to write about.

492
00:50:47,589 --> 00:50:51,040
Yes, of course. I haven't had much time
recently, so when I...

493
00:50:51,057 --> 00:50:52,028
Don't worry about it.

494
00:50:55,797 --> 00:50:57,275
Federico...

495
00:50:58,433 --> 00:51:00,478
Let's play the "putrescent" game.

496
00:51:01,204 --> 00:51:02,051
The what?

497
00:51:02,629 --> 00:51:06,087
It's "putrescent".
It's my new word.

498
00:51:06,594 --> 00:51:08,022
Meaning?

499
00:51:09,962 --> 00:51:12,206
Outdated, outmoded.

500
00:51:12,289 --> 00:51:14,427
Generally out, then.

501
00:51:15,759 --> 00:51:17,011
Yes, generally.

502
00:51:20,468 --> 00:51:24,048
Come on, Ferry.
You have to hear these putrescences Federico does...

503
00:51:24,402 --> 00:51:28,198
They're histerical. They're...
- Yes, come on, Ferry!

504
00:51:29,481 --> 00:51:34,772
Look. Let's skip the tea, let's run out and
have some dinner.

505
00:51:37,232 --> 00:51:38,478
What shall I wear?

506
00:51:41,589 --> 00:51:42,413
The blue.

507
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:45,700
I don't like the blue.

508
00:51:46,797 --> 00:51:47,735
What about the grey, then?

509
00:51:49,136 --> 00:51:50,566
Oh, I love the grey, yeah.
Ok.

510
00:51:56,303 --> 00:51:58,510
I went to see that play with Jorge.

511
00:51:58,672 --> 00:51:59,359
Which one?

512
00:51:59,851 --> 00:52:00,993
Jorge is a worm.

513
00:52:01,055 --> 00:52:02,117
"Salome".

514
00:52:02,209 --> 00:52:06,439
- Oscar Wilde. I thought they banned it.
- He's a faggot.

515
00:52:06,693 --> 00:52:07,887
Marricon.

516
00:52:08,018 --> 00:52:09,989
Unproved by all accounts.

517
00:52:10,359 --> 00:52:12,893
Not Wilde, Jorge.

518
00:52:12,997 --> 00:52:14,457
He's got a girlfriend.

519
00:52:15,187 --> 00:52:17,557
Oh, come on! He screams "queer"
from every orifice.

520
00:52:17,702 --> 00:52:21,347
- Keep your voice down, Louie.
- Oh, we should all keep quiet, should we, Adella?

521
00:52:21,527 --> 00:52:22,346
Well, I won't!

522
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:23,984
- For god's sake...
- No!

523
00:52:24,304 --> 00:52:28,353
Because it is illegal. And it is illegal because
it is immoral. And I tell you...

524
00:52:28,966 --> 00:52:32,153
They should get more then 15 years
hard bloody labour for it.

525
00:52:33,748 --> 00:52:37,686
I never thought I'd see the day that Luis Buñuel
gave us a lecture on morality.

526
00:52:39,553 --> 00:52:41,609
- Dance with me.
- "Dance with me".

527
00:52:42,022 --> 00:52:44,649
- That's enough.
- Don't bother, Federico.

528
00:52:44,951 --> 00:52:46,537
Oh, I'm sorry, Magdalena.

529
00:52:46,565 --> 00:52:50,609
Did I offend your vaginal sensibilities?
- Leave her alone.

530
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:54,650
Look at the big, brave Federico.

531
00:52:55,499 --> 00:52:56,676
What a man.

532
00:52:56,952 --> 00:52:59,740
- You are drunk.
- You don't say.

533
00:53:09,935 --> 00:53:12,412
Things have certainly changed around here,
my friend.

534
00:53:14,968 --> 00:53:15,933
What do you mean?

535
00:53:17,586 --> 00:53:18,880
It's the college.

536
00:53:19,389 --> 00:53:20,845
Staying on, year after year.

537
00:53:20,846 --> 00:53:23,601
Studying this and that
until you blew in the face.

538
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:27,724
It is a fantasy land for
spoiled school kids.

539
00:53:28,105 --> 00:53:29,224
Look at Federico.

540
00:53:29,511 --> 00:53:31,513
Oh, I know. He's doing well.

541
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,622
Plays, whatever.

542
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:37,702
In Paris, they would do a fuck up
at his work.

543
00:53:38,365 --> 00:53:44,920
It's... What's your word?
Putrescent.

544
00:53:47,729 --> 00:53:51,776
Federico is working on something now.

545
00:53:52,184 --> 00:53:53,920
That will blow everything apart.

546
00:53:54,292 --> 00:53:55,692
What's it about?

547
00:53:55,729 --> 00:53:57,095
His family?

548
00:53:57,187 --> 00:53:58,340
Butterflies?

549
00:53:58,515 --> 00:53:59,325
God?

550
00:54:02,306 --> 00:54:03,349
Me.

551
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:15,105
It'll be sentimental rubbish.

552
00:54:16,723 --> 00:54:18,659
Always has been, always will be.

553
00:54:21,963 --> 00:54:26,049
Still, if you go around
behaving like that...

554
00:54:27,648 --> 00:54:29,504
...then you have to expect it.

555
00:54:31,145 --> 00:54:32,334
Look.

556
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:35,593
You don't have to say anything.

557
00:54:36,601 --> 00:54:38,412
But you should really get away from here.

558
00:54:39,692 --> 00:54:41,531
In Paris, with your talents...

559
00:54:41,532 --> 00:54:43,676
You could set the place on fire!

560
00:54:45,652 --> 00:54:47,237
I'm leaving tomorrow.

561
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:49,897
What? Why?

562
00:54:50,598 --> 00:54:52,107
It's over here.

563
00:54:52,531 --> 00:54:54,370
Everything's gone.

564
00:54:56,113 --> 00:54:57,997
To your word.

565
00:55:01,745 --> 00:55:07,159
Now this is more like it! Come on, Dalí.
Shake a leg!

566
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:26,622
It's five o' clock.

567
00:55:29,914 --> 00:55:30,800
What's that?

568
00:55:34,345 --> 00:55:37,709
The revolutionary Dali communicator!

569
00:55:38,111 --> 00:55:39,712
I'll be a millionaire!

570
00:55:40,199 --> 00:55:41,726
I'll buy shares.

571
00:55:54,589 --> 00:55:55,609
Which hand?

572
00:55:57,653 --> 00:55:58,641
Left.

573
00:56:00,168 --> 00:56:00,828
For you.

574
00:56:01,074 --> 00:56:02,495
And

575
00:56:06,064 --> 00:56:06,835
For you.

576
00:56:43,597 --> 00:56:44,507
Where are you going?

577
00:56:45,558 --> 00:56:46,558
To the bathroom.

578
00:56:47,242 --> 00:56:48,101
With your diary?

579
00:58:04,263 --> 00:58:05,293
<i>If I became a fish?</i>

580
00:58:06,336 --> 00:58:08,311
<i>I'd change into the grave.</i>

581
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,957
<i>If I became the grass?</i>

582
00:58:11,992 --> 00:58:13,120
<i>Change into water.</i>

583
00:58:13,843 --> 00:58:15,553
<i>If a became an angel?</i>

584
00:58:17,108 --> 00:58:19,041
<i>I'd change into an eye.</i>

585
00:58:19,581 --> 00:58:21,452
<i>And if I became an eye?</i>

586
00:58:21,792 --> 00:58:24,770
<i>I'd turn into a knife.
Then I'd cut you to pieces.</i>

587
00:59:08,958 --> 00:59:11,786
<i>Salvador Dali, with your
olive-colored voice...</i>

588
00:59:12,297 --> 00:59:13,380
It's genius.

589
00:59:14,206 --> 00:59:15,498
I mean, everybody says it is.

590
00:59:16,498 --> 00:59:19,659
Tell me the bit about the bicycles, again.

591
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:37,428
<i>I sing your restless longing for the statue</i>

592
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:41,072
<i>Your fear of the feeling,
that await you in the street</i>

593
00:59:42,527 --> 00:59:45,498
<i>I sing the small sea siren who sings to you</i>

594
00:59:45,876 --> 00:59:48,621
<i>Riding her bicycle of corals and conches</i>

595
00:59:49,161 --> 00:59:50,462
<i>But above all</i>

596
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:52,774
<i>I sing a common thought</i>

597
00:59:53,792 --> 00:59:56,394
<i>That joins us in the dark and golden hours</i>

598
01:00:01,362 --> 01:00:04,167
<i>The light that blinds our eyes is not art</i>

599
01:00:05,647 --> 01:00:07,398
<i>Rather it is love.</i>

600
01:00:08,676 --> 01:00:09,468
<i>Friendship.</i>

601
01:00:11,126 --> 01:00:12,995
<i>Crossed swords.</i>

602
01:00:13,366 --> 01:00:14,988
I don't like that line.

603
01:00:15,688 --> 01:00:16,558
Thanks.

604
01:00:19,284 --> 01:00:20,777
I love the rest of it.

605
01:00:21,799 --> 01:00:22,473
Do you?

606
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:24,892
Yes.

607
01:01:12,893 --> 01:01:13,527
Look at me.

608
01:01:14,016 --> 01:01:15,695
Look at me, Salvador.

609
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:16,499
Look at me.

610
01:01:23,952 --> 01:01:25,007
You see?

611
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:44,735
No limit.

612
01:02:14,104 --> 01:02:14,888
Sorry.

613
01:02:35,924 --> 01:02:37,257
It doesn't matter.

614
01:02:39,514 --> 01:02:40,893
It's not important.

615
01:02:46,978 --> 01:02:48,399
It's late.

616
01:02:48,537 --> 01:02:49,959
You should sleep.

617
01:02:51,603 --> 01:02:54,163
We'll go for a breakfast at the"Pelican".

618
01:02:54,393 --> 01:02:56,194
And you'll paint all afternoon.

619
01:03:06,308 --> 01:03:07,178
Salvador.

620
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,732
What do you see, when...?

621
01:03:15,415 --> 01:03:16,505
You can tell me.

622
01:03:18,337 --> 01:03:19,800
You can tell me anything.

623
01:03:27,451 --> 01:03:29,035
I'm going to Paris.

624
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:31,594
What?

625
01:03:32,231 --> 01:03:33,833
I'm going to go and see Louie.

626
01:03:39,642 --> 01:03:43,171
He'll introduce me to... Picasso.

627
01:03:44,284 --> 01:03:46,347
And the surrealists and...

628
01:03:49,616 --> 01:03:51,326
He'll take me to nightclubs.

629
01:03:53,474 --> 01:03:57,265
I'm going now.
Don't...

630
01:03:58,261 --> 01:04:01,843
Don't, don't try to stop me.
- Why would I try? Salvador!

631
01:05:13,064 --> 01:05:14,282
Federico!

632
01:05:18,376 --> 01:05:20,132
Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

633
01:05:20,552 --> 01:05:23,516
- What happened?
- Nothing, nothing.

634
01:05:24,537 --> 01:05:28,102
I just... I need some air.

635
01:05:45,535 --> 01:05:48,901
- I wanted to tell you, but it was
going to be a surprise...

636
01:05:51,249 --> 01:05:53,196
I got a job at the Tribune.

637
01:05:54,321 --> 01:05:57,776
- That's wonderful.
- I know, can you believe it?

638
01:05:58,464 --> 01:06:02,012
Anyway, it starts in a month, so...

639
01:06:02,217 --> 01:06:05,189
I'm taking a break, I'm going to Italy.

640
01:06:05,576 --> 01:06:08,666
And I thought, maybe you'd like to come.

641
01:06:09,603 --> 01:06:14,037
You could write, I could write and
you need to get away anyway, so...

642
01:06:14,038 --> 01:06:14,544
Hey.

643
01:06:17,804 --> 01:06:19,084
What are you doing here?

644
01:06:20,984 --> 01:06:22,496
It's a great spectacle, isn't it?

645
01:06:22,589 --> 01:06:25,019
Everyone's here.

646
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:28,070
How was Paris?

647
01:06:28,411 --> 01:06:30,716
I didn't know when you were coming back.

648
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:33,727
Today.

649
01:06:35,553 --> 01:06:37,464
I have an examination.

650
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:42,155
Federico?

651
01:06:43,674 --> 01:06:44,746
I should go, too.

652
01:06:46,275 --> 01:06:47,170
Okay.

653
01:06:47,999 --> 01:06:49,362
I'll stay.

654
01:06:50,077 --> 01:06:53,714
What were you saying before? Something
about Italy, I don't know.

655
01:06:56,573 --> 01:06:58,826
Nothing.

656
01:07:11,601 --> 01:07:15,323
You have 20 minutes to deliver an oral
critique of Raphael.

657
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:17,194
You may begin.

658
01:07:22,607 --> 01:07:23,594
Mr. Dalí?

659
01:07:27,003 --> 01:07:28,635
Gentlemen...

660
01:07:29,127 --> 01:07:34,335
I returned from Paris with
a conclusion that...

661
01:07:34,931 --> 01:07:42,590
The entire amount of real, artistic knowledge
contained within this panel of professors...

662
01:07:42,596 --> 01:07:45,059
... is not equal to one half of this.

663
01:07:46,513 --> 01:07:48,348
This - my fingernail.

664
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:50,197
Not one half, gentlemen.

665
01:07:51,316 --> 01:07:55,059
And I've been insulting myself
by letting your shruddy practices,

666
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:57,157
your pathetic, outdated theories...

667
01:07:57,158 --> 01:08:00,204
... and questionable characters
shit on my genious.

668
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:05,526
I hope with all my heart that you'll
realize I'm right and...

669
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:09,955
Give up this foolishness and go back
to the pigsties and the haystacks,

670
01:08:09,956 --> 01:08:12,005
where you might be of some real use.

671
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:28,968
Magdalena.

672
01:08:30,636 --> 01:08:31,704
I know.

673
01:08:34,008 --> 01:08:36,130
I know, Adella.

674
01:08:39,912 --> 01:08:42,425
I have to do something.

675
01:08:48,976 --> 01:08:50,215
Could you...

676
01:08:53,511 --> 01:08:55,513
Could you lend me something?

677
01:08:56,249 --> 01:08:59,764
A dress, to make me irresistible?

678
01:09:14,804 --> 01:09:16,092
Would you like some tea?

679
01:09:16,771 --> 01:09:19,077
Tea? Only *idiots* drink tea.

680
01:09:20,110 --> 01:09:22,072
I'm surprised we don't drown in the shit.

681
01:09:26,205 --> 01:09:27,877
So, you got back yesterday?

682
01:09:28,899 --> 01:09:31,170
Federico, what does yesterday matter?

683
01:09:31,943 --> 01:09:36,022
Yesterday... I didn't exist.
Yesterday is nothing.

684
01:09:36,612 --> 01:09:39,907
Today, this moment and the bright and
glorious future.

685
01:09:40,618 --> 01:09:41,656
I'm sorry.

686
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:43,740
I'm a bit confused.

687
01:09:44,408 --> 01:09:47,485
So, Salvador. Who are you pretending
to be today?

688
01:09:48,006 --> 01:09:48,942
Why?

689
01:09:49,485 --> 01:09:52,113
Well, is it Salvador?

690
01:09:52,764 --> 01:09:55,532
The extreme anarchist who's only
escaped from prison?

691
01:09:55,869 --> 01:09:58,538
Or Salvador Dali,
the genius artist of Madrid?

692
01:09:59,281 --> 01:10:01,567
Or Salvador, the lover...
- Listen to me.

693
01:10:02,249 --> 01:10:06,586
An agent came from
Paris to see my new work.

694
01:10:06,587 --> 01:10:11,019
The canvases from
Cadaques and he loved them.

695
01:10:11,481 --> 01:10:14,151
He called me the most exciting young
artist in Spain.

696
01:10:16,383 --> 01:10:20,599
So, now - goodbye, Spain!

697
01:10:21,315 --> 01:10:23,126
Goodbye, Madrid!

698
01:10:24,121 --> 01:10:27,857
And Paris... Paris - toujours!

699
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:38,041
Louie introduced me to Picasso and there was
this extraordinary man...

700
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:41,140
Who gave me a photograph of his wife...

701
01:10:43,862 --> 01:10:45,437
... and, she's naked.

702
01:10:46,876 --> 01:10:48,630
You won't believe this.

703
01:10:52,963 --> 01:10:54,926
Gala. Galushka.

704
01:10:58,446 --> 01:11:01,771
She's Russian.
She's my twin soul.

705
01:11:02,484 --> 01:11:04,788
I've dreamt of this woman my whole life.

706
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:08,467
When I have her,
nothing will be able to stop me.

707
01:11:09,281 --> 01:11:10,858
I'll bring Paris to its knees.

708
01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:14,330
King... King Salvador!

709
01:11:15,218 --> 01:11:20,047
You should've seen Louie, he's
asking me to make his first film with him...

710
01:11:20,053 --> 01:11:20,782
- Salvador!
- ...and the surrealists and impressionists...

711
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:22,714
When I go back, they
won't know what's hit them.

712
01:11:22,715 --> 01:11:25,830
The ideas, I've got it, it's
coming, I can taste it...

713
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:28,066
- What's coming?
- I need to go to Cadaques to prepare...

714
01:11:28,433 --> 01:11:30,702
- What do you mean? Your father said...
- My father said what?

715
01:11:31,649 --> 01:11:33,470
I got expelled!

716
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,692
My father can go fuck himself!

717
01:11:37,038 --> 01:11:41,920
- From this point on, my real life begins.
- Your real life? And what about this life?

718
01:11:42,287 --> 01:11:44,756
- You can't just abandon everything!
- Abandon what?

719
01:11:45,171 --> 01:11:50,259
Sitting in an art room all day,
going out of my mind with boredom?

720
01:11:50,619 --> 01:11:54,063
Drinking myself into a stupor every night?

721
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:57,317
I'm so sick of it!
- How can you say that?

722
01:11:58,477 --> 01:12:00,354
Your painting's never been better.

723
01:12:02,889 --> 01:12:06,267
This isn't you, Salvador.
What's happened to you?

724
01:12:10,137 --> 01:12:13,957
- Why can't you just be happy for me?
- Happy for you?

725
01:12:14,587 --> 01:12:21,130
You're just selfish,
like Louie says...

726
01:12:23,556 --> 01:12:26,085
You're a selfish fuckin' marricon.

727
01:12:26,923 --> 01:12:30,448
Oh, really? And what exactly does that
make you?

728
01:13:04,577 --> 01:13:06,446
I can't.

729
01:13:14,145 --> 01:13:15,824
Federico!

730
01:13:18,582 --> 01:13:19,899
Let her in.

731
01:13:28,727 --> 01:13:30,664
Sleeping?

732
01:13:44,410 --> 01:13:46,838
You look as if you are still dreaming.

733
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:57,194
- Magdalena.
- Just for now... Just this once.

734
01:14:09,054 --> 01:14:10,994
Don't worry about anything, just...

735
01:17:10,004 --> 01:17:11,082
Salvador?

736
01:17:47,774 --> 01:17:50,061
<i>There are very few angels who sing</i>

737
01:17:50,733 --> 01:17:52,975
<i>There are very few dogs who bark</i>

738
01:17:54,502 --> 01:17:58,074
<i>A thousand violins fit
in the palm of my hand</i>

739
01:18:00,591 --> 01:18:03,344
<i>But, the weeping is an enormous dog</i>

740
01:18:03,604 --> 01:18:06,391
<i>The weeping is an enormous angel</i>

741
01:18:07,583 --> 01:18:10,311
<i>The weeping is an enormous violin</i>

742
01:18:10,581 --> 01:18:13,120
<i>Tears have muzzled the wind</i>

743
01:18:14,085 --> 01:18:17,221
<i>And nothing's heard, but the weeping</i>

744
01:19:54,161 --> 01:19:55,557
Coffee, please.

745
01:20:01,058 --> 01:20:03,796
Why they've made this film?

746
01:20:04,189 --> 01:20:07,901
Do you know what they called it?
"An andalusian dog".

747
01:20:09,161 --> 01:20:10,429
I don't think they...

748
01:20:10,573 --> 01:20:14,777
Well, I do. I mean,
I'm from where exactly?

749
01:20:16,227 --> 01:20:18,496
Do they even know anyone
else from Andalucia?

750
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:22,547
Listen, you need a complete break.

751
01:20:23,007 --> 01:20:27,287
Everyone says so. What about your idea for
the travelling theatre?

752
01:20:27,482 --> 01:20:28,522
You should go.

753
01:20:29,604 --> 01:20:31,715
Get out of Madrid for a while.

754
01:20:32,086 --> 01:20:34,478
Get on with your life, Federico.

755
01:20:38,294 --> 01:20:40,183
Have you spoken to him?

756
01:20:41,115 --> 01:20:42,908
Have you spoken to Salvador?

757
01:20:43,209 --> 01:20:45,295
I've tried to talk to him...

758
01:20:46,010 --> 01:20:46,830
In letters.

759
01:20:48,778 --> 01:20:51,467
He won't...

760
01:20:51,472 --> 01:20:55,463
He took Luis to Cadaqes.
I saw their pictures in the paper.

761
01:20:56,885 --> 01:20:59,939
And apparently, he's got this woman.

762
01:20:59,976 --> 01:21:01,931
This Gala woman.

763
01:21:03,102 --> 01:21:05,773
God knows what he does with her.

764
01:21:06,841 --> 01:21:07,817
Sorry.

765
01:21:08,481 --> 01:21:13,371
It' just... It's as if nothing ever
happened.

766
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:20,337
Sometimes I feel we've never
even met.

767
01:21:20,498 --> 01:21:23,365
- I'm so sorry, Federico.
- No.

768
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,563
I'm the one who should be sorry.

769
01:21:27,192 --> 01:21:30,256
I can't let you take the blame for that.

770
01:21:30,295 --> 01:21:34,228
Magdalena, please understand.
There is no one I'd rather be with.

771
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:38,721
If we had a choice in
these things, which we don't.

772
01:21:38,722 --> 01:21:39,543
Don't we?

773
01:21:45,816 --> 01:21:48,144
I'm not saying it's gonna be easy,

774
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:51,431
but I don't think you
can carry on like this.

775
01:21:52,904 --> 01:21:57,436
I mean, you can. Of course you can,
but it has a price.

776
01:21:59,312 --> 01:22:04,542
I think sometimes we just have to risk it.
Live the way we feel.

777
01:22:06,644 --> 01:22:09,896
And you know, it might not turn out well...

778
01:22:10,948 --> 01:22:13,334
... sometimes it doesn't
turn out well at all.

779
01:22:14,559 --> 01:22:19,081
But we have to try.
We have to keep on trying.

780
01:22:22,558 --> 01:22:25,141
Otherwise, we just become puppets.

781
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:28,485
All painted smiles, bare inside.

782
01:22:29,049 --> 01:22:30,646
Nothing.

783
01:22:31,205 --> 01:22:32,761
But jealous.

784
01:22:35,299 --> 01:22:38,035
Anyway, if you miss him more than enough...

785
01:22:38,424 --> 01:22:40,135
I should depart.

786
01:22:41,579 --> 01:22:43,513
Goodbye.

787
01:24:55,982 --> 01:25:01,016
I've come in my overalls,
so you know I'm serious.

788
01:25:03,668 --> 01:25:05,604
They've been all over the country.

789
01:25:05,946 --> 01:25:07,123
These overalls.

790
01:25:07,348 --> 01:25:12,211
In the last year, they've wrap shoulders
with every kind of Spaniard.

791
01:25:12,299 --> 01:25:16,269
They've had a set,
they've directed plays and films.

792
01:25:16,591 --> 01:25:17,909
They are exhausted.

793
01:25:18,015 --> 01:25:24,655
And they are extremly glad to be here,
drinking wine with friends in the sun.

794
01:25:25,168 --> 01:25:26,481
But...

795
01:25:26,914 --> 01:25:30,524
We mustn't be deceived
by sunshine in Madrid.

796
01:25:30,998 --> 01:25:33,641
Whilst fascism is casting its shadow
all over Spain.

797
01:25:35,162 --> 01:25:38,713
Great sacrifices need to be made.

798
01:25:39,315 --> 01:25:43,105
Great risks need to be taken.

799
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:46,525
So, I have something
here to read to you.

800
01:25:46,526 --> 01:25:49,954
And if you are proof, then I
want to ask for your signatures.

801
01:25:55,267 --> 01:26:03,363
<i>We, intellect ones, artists and members of the
free thinking professions reaffirm our support...</i>

802
01:26:03,542 --> 01:26:06,696
<i>... for the democratically
elected popular government...</i>

803
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:11,291
<i>... and we do so for the aspirations. We...</i>

804
01:26:14,584 --> 01:26:19,412
<i>We do so... I do so...
for freedom.</i>

805
01:26:19,883 --> 01:26:21,419
<i>Not some romantic ideal.</i>

806
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:25,061
<i>Not something for students to
shout about in late night bars.</i>

807
01:26:25,544 --> 01:26:26,761
<i>That's easy.</i>

808
01:26:27,569 --> 01:26:30,031
<i>That's just a word.</i>

809
01:26:30,445 --> 01:26:36,743
<i>Real freedom is hard.
It's painful.</i>

810
01:26:37,477 --> 01:26:39,248
<i>It's dangerous.</i>

811
01:26:40,787 --> 01:26:42,225
<i>But I want it.</i>

812
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:44,571
<i>I want to try for it.</i>

813
01:26:44,798 --> 01:26:49,237
<i>Whoever I decide to be.</i>

814
01:26:49,418 --> 01:26:51,957
<i>However I decide to live.</i>

815
01:26:52,849 --> 01:26:56,444
<i>Whomever I choose as my companions.</i>

816
01:26:56,570 --> 01:26:57,872
<i>My friends.</i>

817
01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:00,898
<i>It's my right.</i>

818
01:27:01,812 --> 01:27:04,418
<i>It's our right.</i>

819
01:27:04,517 --> 01:27:07,738
<i>Freedom.
Now.</i>

820
01:27:08,517 --> 01:27:10,313
<i>In Spain.</i>

821
01:27:36,937 --> 01:27:37,999
Thanks.

822
01:27:38,350 --> 01:27:39,370
Come here.

823
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:49,087
I don't see him anymore.

824
01:27:49,448 --> 01:27:50,036
No?

825
01:27:50,548 --> 01:27:57,054
Don't care, too. We no longer speak the same
language. The only word he understands now...

826
01:27:57,211 --> 01:27:58,695
... is "money".

827
01:27:59,808 --> 01:28:01,251
He wrote to me.

828
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:03,825
And?

829
01:28:04,281 --> 01:28:05,511
I know.

830
01:28:06,122 --> 01:28:08,278
8 years.
Nothing.

831
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:12,966
He asked me to come and see him.
Come and meet Gala.

832
01:28:13,216 --> 01:28:17,666
Bloody witch. Still fucking every artist
in Paris, from what I hear.

833
01:28:18,706 --> 01:28:19,779
What else?

834
01:28:19,933 --> 01:28:22,247
He thought we should work together again.

835
01:28:22,667 --> 01:28:26,233
He said we could reach an agreement
this time, on a lot of things.

836
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:28,926
He signed it "Buda".

837
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:32,286
Will you see him?

838
01:28:35,691 --> 01:28:38,846
Be careful, Federico.

839
01:28:41,423 --> 01:28:44,669
Where are you off to, brother?
The rally is this way.

840
01:28:45,135 --> 01:28:46,827
Senor García Lorca!
- Hello.

841
01:28:48,013 --> 01:28:52,784
I didn't recognize you. Join us at the demonstrations
and the support of the republic.

842
01:28:53,098 --> 01:28:56,848
The troops in Morocco are siding with the fascist.
- I'll come later.

843
01:28:56,849 --> 01:28:58,187
- Gracias.
- Good luck.

844
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,050
Come in.

845
01:29:25,326 --> 01:29:26,560
Come through.

846
01:29:29,601 --> 01:29:34,198
Time and Dalí wait for no man!

847
01:29:36,865 --> 01:29:40,765
Ignore this absolute prutescent
travesty of a hotel.

848
01:29:41,089 --> 01:29:43,159
It's temporary surroundings.

849
01:29:44,818 --> 01:29:48,871
Apart from the bear.
Have you seen the bear?

850
01:29:51,157 --> 01:29:55,995
It has a reality about it, in this bear...

851
01:29:56,459 --> 01:29:59,713
... primacy of Eden.

852
01:30:07,594 --> 01:30:08,997
You look the same.

853
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:10,808
Thanks.

854
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:14,544
I grew this moustache.

855
01:30:20,718 --> 01:30:28,763
What shall it be? This place?
College? Merde? Us?

856
01:30:40,610 --> 01:30:43,955
Federico.

857
01:30:54,554 --> 01:30:56,122
All this time.

858
01:30:58,245 --> 01:31:00,590
All this time.

859
01:31:02,409 --> 01:31:07,647
The dark, unfavaned retrospect

860
01:31:08,018 --> 01:31:11,387
...the teaming gulf.

861
01:31:13,818 --> 01:31:15,585
The sleepers.

862
01:31:17,078 --> 01:31:19,257
And shadows.

863
01:31:26,304 --> 01:31:27,404
Cheri.

864
01:31:28,897 --> 01:31:31,255
It's Federico.

865
01:31:31,890 --> 01:31:34,607
Federico, this is Gala.
My wife.

866
01:31:36,351 --> 01:31:39,065
Delighted to meet you, at last.

867
01:31:39,619 --> 01:31:41,366
Isn't he charming, cheri?

868
01:31:41,669 --> 01:31:43,813
I've heard so much about you.

869
01:31:56,601 --> 01:31:57,558
Smile.

870
01:32:03,676 --> 01:32:05,274
He went to America.

871
01:32:06,657 --> 01:32:10,239
I loved it. Well, it's America.

872
01:32:10,657 --> 01:32:14,151
New York was... pitiful.

873
01:32:14,345 --> 01:32:17,965
Poverty and suffering...
- We're gonna go back to America soon.

874
01:32:19,714 --> 01:32:21,405
Spain just seems so...

875
01:32:21,655 --> 01:32:22,253
Dangerous?

876
01:32:22,551 --> 01:32:23,879
Passe.

877
01:32:25,991 --> 01:32:29,990
Anyway, America is the place for our opera.

878
01:32:30,852 --> 01:32:36,913
No. You write, I design.
It will be a triumph.

879
01:32:37,163 --> 01:32:38,105
Will it?

880
01:32:38,285 --> 01:32:41,032
Undoubtedly, considering
the subject matter.

881
01:32:41,122 --> 01:32:41,931
Which will be?

882
01:32:42,732 --> 01:32:45,208
Louis the Second of Bavaria.

883
01:32:45,395 --> 01:32:49,449
He was... He was a deviant, you know.

884
01:32:51,216 --> 01:32:57,306
It'll be the most shocking opera ever staged.
All kinds of unspeakable things...

885
01:32:57,513 --> 01:32:59,981
Louie told me the surrealists
threw you out.

886
01:33:00,572 --> 01:33:03,611
So, the two of you've become friends again.
When did that happen?

887
01:33:03,881 --> 01:33:06,746
I imagine around the time
he stopped seeing you.

888
01:33:06,799 --> 01:33:11,619
The surrealists expelled
me from the movement.

889
01:33:12,547 --> 01:33:15,594
Terribly traumatic.

890
01:33:15,704 --> 01:33:18,299
Breton is a genius.

891
01:33:18,612 --> 01:33:26,798
His whole equation with communism
just makes me want to...

892
01:33:29,997 --> 01:33:31,110
... puke.

893
01:33:36,368 --> 01:33:43,678
The only viable solution for surrealism:
the World War.

894
01:33:44,069 --> 01:33:46,210
A cleansing.

895
01:33:47,272 --> 01:33:49,086
A great flood.

896
01:33:49,284 --> 01:33:52,546
Cut through all this dead wood.

897
01:33:52,770 --> 01:33:54,988
Purge the weak elements.

898
01:33:55,901 --> 01:33:58,081
An era of enlightenment.

899
01:33:58,082 --> 01:34:02,803
Are you saying you
actually support the fascist?

900
01:34:04,363 --> 01:34:09,931
You used to be an anarchist.
- Oh, Federico, you've become so... liberal.

901
01:34:10,517 --> 01:34:14,772
With all the government schemes
and your theateral little people...

902
01:34:16,495 --> 01:34:21,568
Listen. This country is on the blink
of something terrible.

903
01:34:22,162 --> 01:34:25,482
And here you are siding with the people who
could destroy everything we've stand for.

904
01:34:25,588 --> 01:34:27,804
I know you are not through,

905
01:34:27,805 --> 01:34:34,205
but you must see that'd be no freedom
of speech, anyone who is different...

906
01:34:34,832 --> 01:34:36,688
Who strays from the norm...

907
01:34:36,915 --> 01:34:38,775
... would just be wiped out.

908
01:34:42,573 --> 01:34:44,258
Would that be a bad thing?

909
01:34:46,067 --> 01:34:47,693
Naughty boy.

910
01:34:48,312 --> 01:34:49,263
You're joking.

911
01:34:50,668 --> 01:34:53,638
Salvador is completely apolitical.

912
01:34:55,992 --> 01:34:57,208
<i>No one knows you</i>

913
01:34:57,425 --> 01:35:00,130
<i>No
But I sing of you</i>

914
01:35:00,169 --> 01:35:02,282
<i>I sing, for later on,</i>

915
01:35:02,317 --> 01:35:04,371
<i>Of your profile and your grace</i>

916
01:35:04,977 --> 01:35:07,170
<i>The noble maturity of your understanding</i>

917
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:11,356
<i>Your appetite for death and
the taste of its mouth</i>

918
01:35:12,217 --> 01:35:14,669
<i>The sadness in you valiant gaiety.</i>

919
01:35:17,988 --> 01:35:19,773
It's nothing to my ode.

920
01:35:20,972 --> 01:35:22,712
Gala, you've heard my ode.

921
01:35:22,907 --> 01:35:26,444
Press went crazy for it.

922
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:30,527
<i>Oh, Salvador Dali,
with your olive-colored voice</i>

923
01:35:31,753 --> 01:35:34,085
Federico, you finish the rest.
I want Gala to hear it.

924
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:40,214
I'm afraid I have to go.

925
01:35:44,718 --> 01:35:46,692
It's been such a pleasure.

926
01:35:58,245 --> 01:36:00,458
- Let me see you out.
- There is no need.

927
01:36:01,116 --> 01:36:02,871
She doesn't mind, you know?

928
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,107
She and I are like twins, not like lovers.

929
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:07,470
Not like us.

930
01:36:09,766 --> 01:36:14,550
Look at you, you little beast.
You're so angry, you could spit.

931
01:36:14,957 --> 01:36:18,641
I knew you would be.
I planned everything.

932
01:36:19,964 --> 01:36:23,900
And, is everything going
according to plan, Salvador?

933
01:36:24,264 --> 01:36:26,076
Knew you would say that, too.

934
01:36:27,803 --> 01:36:32,757
Listen, it's alright now.
Everything is alright.

935
01:36:33,103 --> 01:36:34,903
Go pack your things

936
01:36:35,036 --> 01:36:36,812
Say your goodbyes

937
01:36:37,304 --> 01:36:39,741
And we'll conquer America together.

938
01:36:42,603 --> 01:36:46,177
I hurt your pride, I know.

939
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:48,299
But, I'll make it up to you.

940
01:36:48,982 --> 01:36:51,171
You'll teach me how.

941
01:36:57,926 --> 01:36:59,352
There's someone else?

942
01:37:00,367 --> 01:37:06,351
It doesn't matter. There's Gala...
We can all live together. We can...

943
01:37:07,591 --> 01:37:09,763
Goodbye, Salvador.

944
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:18,049
You'll come back.

945
01:37:19,384 --> 01:37:23,063
Sweet little tail dangeling
between your legs.

946
01:37:23,886 --> 01:37:26,456
You won't be able to think
about anything else!

947
01:37:27,718 --> 01:37:30,492
Senor García Lorca, how was your meeting
with Dalí?

948
01:37:30,580 --> 01:37:32,590
Will you work together again?

949
01:37:32,711 --> 01:37:34,108
What do you think of him?

950
01:37:34,975 --> 01:37:36,626
What do I think of him?

951
01:37:36,756 --> 01:37:39,838
Well... He's a genius.

952
01:37:40,655 --> 01:37:41,648
A genius.

953
01:37:41,761 --> 01:37:44,400
Genius, Salvador Dalí!

954
01:37:49,049 --> 01:37:53,531
Very charming... Exactly as you've said.

955
01:37:58,890 --> 01:38:04,658
I'm going to my room, Salvador.
I'll see you in the morning.

956
01:38:44,846 --> 01:38:46,563
See you in the morning, my love.

957
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:34,268
I just saw Paco.
What on Earth do you think you're doing?

958
01:39:34,455 --> 01:39:35,713
I'm going back to Granada.

959
01:39:36,323 --> 01:39:39,717
Have you finally lost your mind?
The news this morning, Federico?

960
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:44,104
Morocco's fallen. It's only a matter of time
before they get to Granada.

961
01:39:44,559 --> 01:39:45,938
Listen...

962
01:39:46,817 --> 01:39:49,289
I'll only be there for a few days.

963
01:39:49,736 --> 01:39:51,273
I have to be with my family.

964
01:39:51,427 --> 01:39:54,855
I've got so much do to, Louie.
I can tell you...

965
01:39:55,348 --> 01:40:00,802
I feel like.. like.. I could write
6 plays without stopping.

966
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:04,407
Without eating.
- Then write them here.

967
01:40:04,974 --> 01:40:08,628
Think about it, Frederico.
These people know who you are,

968
01:40:08,629 --> 01:40:12,722
what you've been saying about Franco...
They know everything.

969
01:40:12,981 --> 01:40:14,965
I have to go home, Louie.

970
01:40:15,113 --> 01:40:18,967
I'll call you as soon as I can.
- Be careful.

971
01:41:29,446 --> 01:41:30,823
Open the door!

972
01:41:31,975 --> 01:41:35,580
- What are you doing?
- Federico García Lorca?

973
01:41:35,954 --> 01:41:38,481
I'm arresting you in the name
of the New Granada.

974
01:41:38,557 --> 01:41:40,242
What are you talking about?

975
01:41:40,243 --> 01:41:41,428
- No!
- Come on!

976
01:41:41,647 --> 01:41:44,325
García Lorca, it is you, marricon.

977
01:41:46,131 --> 01:41:48,905
Granada.
Spain.

978
01:43:39,202 --> 01:43:42,848
The incredible rumours are preceding from
the core of the front this evening.

979
01:43:43,094 --> 01:43:47,664
Reporting the abduction of the
poet, Federico García Lorca,

980
01:43:47,665 --> 01:43:51,244
from his home town in
Granada, three days ago.

981
01:43:53,818 --> 01:43:59,621
The governor of Granada says he does
not know the whereabouts of García Lorca.

982
01:44:58,556 --> 01:45:00,043
Still alive.

983
01:45:00,909 --> 01:45:04,053
Only one way to kill a queer.

984
01:45:22,664 --> 01:45:25,718
The weil of mystery
overshadowing the disappearance

985
01:45:25,719 --> 01:45:28,243
of Federico García
Lorca has been removed.

986
01:45:28,406 --> 01:45:32,731
The news is coming this evening
that the execution of the poet,

987
01:45:32,732 --> 01:45:35,705
Federico García Lorca,
has been confirmed.

988
01:46:17,715 --> 01:46:18,885
Federico.

989
01:46:56,468 --> 01:46:57,740
Salvador!

990
01:47:00,070 --> 01:47:01,892
The guests are here.
