PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,723
- This is new.
- Next murder. Freddie and the child.

3
00:00:10,467 --> 00:00:13,010
Who's the third, then?

4
00:00:16,426 --> 00:00:17,963
Poor, poor girl.

5
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:23,286
My investigation is finished.
The material will go to the prosecutor.

6
00:00:23,483 --> 00:00:28,791
Do you know what I think? Your dad's death, your
mom's murder, the internal investigation and Hans...

7
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:32,459
It was too much.

8
00:00:33,774 --> 00:00:37,375
I think it's all this with
Holst and his child -

9
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:41,503
- that's raking up all sorts of
old shit inside me.

10
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:43,259
Show yourself, dammit!

11
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:46,587
L369G42.

12
00:00:47,426 --> 00:00:48,426
Hello!

13
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:53,622
Donor was a Freddie Holst. There is a
confirmed fertilization and pregnancy.

14
00:00:54,122 --> 00:00:59,786
- And the mother?
- An Anna Maria Larsson.

15
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:07,903
Hi, Dad.

16
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:12,418
EPISODE 10

17
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:49,043
- Rasmus?
- I know where they are now.

18
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:52,426
It's a closed factory. A concrete factory.

19
00:01:52,926 --> 00:01:55,887
- Are Emil and the child there?
- No, I didn't see them. Didn't see anyone.

20
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:59,986
Okay. Stay there.
Wait for reinforcements.

21
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,203
Okay.

22
00:02:18,106 --> 00:02:20,002
Change.

23
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:24,682
Why? I don't have anything on me...

24
00:02:25,182 --> 00:02:27,579
Just do it.

25
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:39,319
Mom said that my dad was a prince
who lived in a castle in France.

26
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,759
Like Santa Claus.
First you believe in him -

27
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:50,187
- but then you realize he doesn't exist.

28
00:02:53,935 --> 00:02:56,522
Please. Please, you must not hurt him.

29
00:05:04,394 --> 00:05:09,555
THE BRIDGE

30
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:13,235
Did you see where they went?

31
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,658
- He shot me.
- You had your vest on.

32
00:05:17,158 --> 00:05:20,262
Have you ever been shot?
It hurts even with a vest.

33
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:24,850
- Did you see the car?
- Yeah, it was a Peugeot Partner. Silver.

34
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,230
License plate?

35
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,682
- Come on.
- It was...

36
00:05:34,182 --> 00:05:36,534
It was Swedish.

37
00:05:40,855 --> 00:05:42,730
- For fuck's sake, man! Come on!
- Yeah, wait.

38
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,547
- HUB 382.
- You just remembered that?

39
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:51,507
- Lay off.
- Henrik.

40
00:05:52,971 --> 00:05:55,427
- What happened?
- We have no fucking idea where they are.

41
00:05:55,927 --> 00:05:58,523
- Thanks to Wonderboy over there.
- Annika Melander is awake.

42
00:05:59,215 --> 00:06:02,115
- We're going there now.
- Good.

43
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:10,466
"Wait for reinforcements."
How hard can that be to understand?

44
00:06:10,694 --> 00:06:14,019
Sorry. I...

45
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:21,870
- We lived in the same foster home.
- We know Emil. Tell us what happened.

46
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,598
I was going to Göteborg. We met.
We hadn't seen each other for many years.

47
00:06:27,098 --> 00:06:31,322
I had time for a cup of coffee, and then...

48
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:33,706
Then I woke up in that room.

49
00:06:34,206 --> 00:06:36,699
But you were in the same
foster family at the Johanssons'.

50
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,826
- Did you treat him badly?
- No one had it good there.

51
00:06:40,326 --> 00:06:43,134
That wasn't what I asked.

52
00:06:43,634 --> 00:06:45,747
No, I...

53
00:06:46,643 --> 00:06:50,074
I treated him like I
treated all the others.

54
00:06:54,062 --> 00:06:55,523
Why do you want to know that?

55
00:06:56,023 --> 00:07:00,146
Because Emil is taking revenge on
everyone he thinks hurt him.

56
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,923
- I didn't do anything.
- He kidnapped you to frame you for several murders.

57
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:07,947
I don't know why.

58
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:13,490
So you have no idea where he could be now?

59
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,130
- No.
- Good.

60
00:07:16,862 --> 00:07:19,754
Was I reported missing when I was gone?

61
00:07:20,254 --> 00:07:21,531
No.

62
00:07:22,031 --> 00:07:23,987
Claes Sandberg, he didn't
report me missing?

63
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:27,899
No, he seemed mostly relieved
that you were gone.

64
00:07:34,903 --> 00:07:37,062
She lied about how she treated
Emil at the foster home.

65
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:40,947
That suggests they didn't do this together.

66
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:44,026
We continue the surveillance anyway.

67
00:07:44,526 --> 00:07:48,923
He'd built an exact copy of
the room in the cellar.

68
00:07:50,143 --> 00:07:55,091
- How does the room in Ystad look now?
- We've removed the barricade.

69
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:58,586
If it means so much to him, that
could be where he is.

70
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:44,147
I had a painting in my room.

71
00:08:44,647 --> 00:08:50,575
A copy of an amateur painting by a
Danish artist who was rightfully forgotten.

72
00:08:51,995 --> 00:08:56,743
But that painting was the only
beautiful thing in my life.

73
00:08:57,243 --> 00:09:00,346
You think I'm exaggerating. Sure you do.

74
00:09:00,846 --> 00:09:05,219
I used to fantasize about how it
would be in there.

75
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:10,250
It could contain anything.
Anything could happen there.

76
00:09:11,003 --> 00:09:14,883
And now we're there, in the painting.

77
00:09:14,962 --> 00:09:17,643
How magical it is.

78
00:09:19,331 --> 00:09:23,211
Do you want to hold him?

79
00:09:32,554 --> 00:09:38,235
Then came that psycho Morten Anker
and I got to know about you.

80
00:09:38,698 --> 00:09:43,235
An interest in art.
That that was inherited.

81
00:09:44,338 --> 00:09:46,811
It was like everything died.

82
00:09:51,562 --> 00:09:53,062
Do you understand that?

83
00:09:54,014 --> 00:09:58,547
I wanted to make everything you
love ugly and distorted.

84
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:03,298
I hoped that you would see it.

85
00:10:03,798 --> 00:10:06,754
You're an art connoisseur, for fuck's sake.

86
00:10:07,254 --> 00:10:09,951
Why didn't you see it, Dad?

87
00:10:10,451 --> 00:10:11,730
Was it not good enough, or what?

88
00:10:11,931 --> 00:10:13,514
I don't know.

89
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:17,091
No, it wasn't good enough.

90
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:31,259
The house is secured. It's empty.

91
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:40,379
- Do you think Emil lived down here?
- Maybe.

92
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:43,903
- Or else it was a time-out room.
- A time-out room, what's that?

93
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:48,842
An empty and boring room where one puts a child
for a time to stop undesirable behavior.

94
00:10:49,342 --> 00:10:50,549
As punishment?

95
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:55,403
Some scientists think that the child sees it as a
consequence of destructive behavior, not as punishment.

96
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:59,331
- Okay.
- But they're wrong.

97
00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:10,283
- The painting...
- What about it?

98
00:11:11,163 --> 00:11:13,947
It's exactly the same as in the
room we found Annika in.

99
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:18,051
- Everything is the same.
- No. The bed is another brand.

100
00:11:18,551 --> 00:11:23,715
The wash basin... another brand.
They're similar, but not identical.

101
00:11:23,842 --> 00:11:28,278
But the painting there is exactly the same.

102
00:11:34,787 --> 00:11:39,195
The car that Rasmus saw was reported
stolen yesterday morning in Lomma.

103
00:11:39,695 --> 00:11:40,855
- There's no trace?
- Not yet.

104
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:42,246
- What is that?
- A painting.

105
00:11:42,746 --> 00:11:45,346
- Yes, I see that.
- It's from the foster home where Emil lived.

106
00:11:46,346 --> 00:11:51,219
Find out who the artist is, what it's called,
and if it depicts a place that exists.

107
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:53,835
Okay.

108
00:11:54,543 --> 00:11:57,890
Everything we had on Annika Melander
matches Emil Larsson, too.

109
00:11:58,326 --> 00:12:00,702
We also have a connection
between him and Helle Anker.

110
00:12:01,202 --> 00:12:03,370
We had him and let him go two times.

111
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,307
- You had no reason to suspect him of it.
- It was still a mistake.

112
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,239
Saga, Henrik. Come here.

113
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:17,139
I scanned the signature and found this.

114
00:12:17,982 --> 00:12:22,355
Claus Arnesen, Danish artist.
He's painted thousands of landscapes.

115
00:12:22,855 --> 00:12:26,859
- Is it called anything?
- 'A Very Fine Day', from '93.

116
00:12:27,034 --> 00:12:29,030
- Where was it painted?
- No idea.

117
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,623
He's made these kinds of paintings
in all the Nordic countries.

118
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:36,010
- Is he alive?
- Yeah, he turns 76 this year.

119
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:41,959
After becoming a pensioner, settled in
Saltholm, right between Malmo and Copenhagen.

120
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:45,318
- Do you have a phone number?
- I'll send it.

121
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:49,139
- Saltholm? Can you even live there?
- Apparently.

122
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:52,235
- Saga Norén...
- Linn Björkman?

123
00:12:52,735 --> 00:12:55,115
- Yes, that's me.
- I'm from Forensics in Lund.

124
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,634
It's regarding a painting that you painted.

125
00:12:58,134 --> 00:13:01,667
- Do you have a minute?
- Not really. Is it important?

126
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:06,219
- Is it related to our case?
- No, but it's important.

127
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:10,259
- Can I send you a photo of it?
- Keep me informed at all times.

128
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:13,730
Thanks.

129
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,838
- What did he want?
- He wanted to talk to Linn.

130
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:20,234
He's painted hundreds of paintings
called 'A Very Fine Day' -

131
00:13:20,235 --> 00:13:23,274
- and he has neither a computer nor a
phone, so we can't send him any photos.

132
00:13:23,582 --> 00:13:26,331
We have to go there.

133
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,145
The helicopter from Göteborg,
wasn't it flown down here?

134
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,360
- Yes.
- John.

135
00:13:54,318 --> 00:13:57,147
What can I do to stop you?

136
00:13:59,794 --> 00:14:03,826
- When were you last afraid?
- I'm afraid now.

137
00:14:04,326 --> 00:14:07,907
I've been afraid every
day since I was five.

138
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:13,202
No one should have to experience that.

139
00:14:18,894 --> 00:14:22,158
I didn't know anything about you.
You can't punish someone for that.

140
00:14:22,658 --> 00:14:26,602
I'm not punishing you.
I'm correcting a mistake that was made.

141
00:14:51,254 --> 00:14:53,835
Get up.

142
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:59,043
Get up!

143
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:15,195
Up with you. Up with you!

144
00:16:11,027 --> 00:16:16,763
Claus Arnesen? Saga Norén, Malmo Police.
This is my partner, Henrik Sabroe.

145
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,962
Saga Norén, Malmo Police.
This is my partner, Henrik Sabroe.

146
00:16:21,462 --> 00:16:25,442
It was I who called you earlier.
Do you recognize this?

147
00:16:26,263 --> 00:16:30,147
I can't see it. Come in.

148
00:16:35,934 --> 00:16:39,962
I just need... my glasses.

149
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,750
- No, they're not there.
- Aren't they?

150
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:57,195
- Do you know where they might be?
- By the bed, maybe?

151
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:02,363
- What do you want with my pictures?
- One of them came up in a murder investigation.

152
00:17:02,863 --> 00:17:06,747
- What?
- One of them came up in a murder investigation.

153
00:17:07,247 --> 00:17:10,499
- Here you go.
- Yes. Let's see.

154
00:17:10,926 --> 00:17:14,482
- Do you recognize this?
- Yeah, it's mine. I made it.

155
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:19,131
- In 1993. Can you remember where?
- No, you...

156
00:17:19,631 --> 00:17:23,219
I can't remember that. I've made
hundreds of these pictures.

157
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:27,106
There's a building in the background.
Do you recognize it?

158
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:30,611
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I can see it.

159
00:17:31,111 --> 00:17:34,538
- Do you know where it is?
- Yes, there.

160
00:17:34,663 --> 00:17:36,363
Where is 'there'?

161
00:17:38,838 --> 00:17:41,019
South. On the eastern side.

162
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,098
As in here on the island?
That barn is here on the island?

163
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,959
Yeah, yeah. It's just a couple
kilometers away. Maybe three.

164
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:53,047
What do we do? The helicopter?

165
00:17:53,547 --> 00:17:56,075
- Then he'll hear us coming.
- Yeah, but it's faster.

166
00:17:57,075 --> 00:18:00,131
But he'll hear us coming.
He has Freddie and the child.

167
00:18:00,631 --> 00:18:02,522
Okay.

168
00:20:17,318 --> 00:20:19,755
Stop.

169
00:20:26,603 --> 00:20:27,603
I understand.

170
00:20:28,134 --> 00:20:31,375
Saga called.
We think we know where they are.

171
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:35,289
- Where?
- Saltholm.

172
00:20:55,906 --> 00:20:57,242
Go up.

173
00:20:57,742 --> 00:20:58,835
No.

174
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:03,787
Then I'll shoot you, and you won't know
what happens with little brother.

175
00:21:33,634 --> 00:21:37,227
Put the noose on.

176
00:21:54,818 --> 00:21:56,318
Don't do this.

177
00:21:56,626 --> 00:22:00,755
- I must.
- You don't need to do anything. You're not choosing.

178
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:04,351
- You always have a choice.
- Only if you have power.

179
00:22:04,851 --> 00:22:10,184
The powerless can never choose.
They only have themselves.

180
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:54,755
Now you can hold him
as long as you're conscious.

181
00:22:55,255 --> 00:22:57,994
I assume you'll drop him.

182
00:22:58,282 --> 00:23:03,962
- He can't take the fall.
- No. No one can take the fall.

183
00:23:58,171 --> 00:24:02,055
You and me, together inside a painting.

184
00:24:03,823 --> 00:24:07,707
A very fine day.

185
00:24:27,851 --> 00:24:30,586
- What now? Reinforcements are coming.
- We can't wait.

186
00:24:45,846 --> 00:24:49,154
Come. Here. Take him.

187
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,307
Saga!

188
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:56,595
Take Emil!

189
00:24:58,807 --> 00:25:02,378
Saga, take Emil!
Put him down! Take Emil!

190
00:25:02,818 --> 00:25:06,219
He killed Hans.

191
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:10,010
Saga, take Emil! Take Emil!
Saga, dammit!

192
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:16,659
Saga, take Emil!

193
00:25:19,207 --> 00:25:20,618
Come on!

194
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,762
Come on!

195
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:46,467
Let go. Let go now. Move. We have them.

196
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:22,298
Were you really going to let him die?

197
00:26:28,182 --> 00:26:30,290
Saga.

198
00:26:58,643 --> 00:27:02,954
Yeah, I shot them. I was forced to.

199
00:27:05,098 --> 00:27:07,711
I didn't know any of them.

200
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:13,515
- Except Morten, once.
- Okay.

201
00:27:18,151 --> 00:27:19,875
Then we have these.

202
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:29,451
My works.

203
00:27:37,134 --> 00:27:39,634
I tried to get his attention.

204
00:27:40,207 --> 00:27:41,643
Freddie's?

205
00:27:43,906 --> 00:27:47,674
But no one understood. Not you, either.

206
00:27:48,174 --> 00:27:50,431
I had to help you.

207
00:27:52,042 --> 00:27:57,202
I had 172 pills... all sorts that I was
just about to take when he came.

208
00:27:57,702 --> 00:28:00,267
- When who came?
- My half-brother. Morten.

209
00:28:01,303 --> 00:28:06,742
His mom felt guilty because he
went crazy in Afghanistan.

210
00:28:07,242 --> 00:28:10,499
- His mother, Helle Anker?
- She wanted to tell him who he really was.

211
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:12,499
Give him a code.

212
00:28:14,174 --> 00:28:19,346
Wanted to tell him about his roots.
I wasn't really listening, but...

213
00:28:19,378 --> 00:28:22,903
But he said a thing...

214
00:28:23,403 --> 00:28:26,578
He said: "Why should I suffer -"

215
00:28:27,078 --> 00:28:30,586
when those who are responsible
for my suffering don't?"

216
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:39,674
Okay.

217
00:28:40,423 --> 00:28:44,547
And it was these people who were
responsible for your suffering.

218
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:47,598
The Johanssons we know a bit about.

219
00:28:48,098 --> 00:28:50,838
Hans Pettersson drove you
back when you ran away.

220
00:28:51,338 --> 00:28:53,891
That's when I ended up in the cellar.

221
00:28:54,391 --> 00:28:57,075
- Have you seen the cellar?
- Yeah.

222
00:29:00,174 --> 00:29:03,318
Then there's Lars-Ove Abrahamsson.
He molested you.

223
00:29:03,818 --> 00:29:06,962
He molested me for four years.

224
00:29:08,118 --> 00:29:11,434
Yeah. And Håkan Ekdahl placed
you at the Johanssons'.

225
00:29:11,934 --> 00:29:15,106
Placed me and forced me to stay.

226
00:29:18,535 --> 00:29:20,595
Then there's these two.

227
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:24,987
Freddie Holst. Helle Anker. Why them?

228
00:29:27,055 --> 00:29:29,269
My creators.

229
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:37,275
They're your creators. Yeah.

230
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,298
But why just them, Emil?

231
00:29:51,462 --> 00:29:53,739
Can you remember your mother?

232
00:29:54,275 --> 00:29:55,951
Yes.

233
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:59,914
- How was she?
- She loved me.

234
00:30:00,414 --> 00:30:03,707
So if she hadn't died, you would
have been fine.

235
00:30:04,207 --> 00:30:07,707
She just collapsed in the kitchen
while making lunch for me.

236
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:09,567
That wasn't Freddie Holst's fault.

237
00:30:09,742 --> 00:30:12,851
- Why are we talking about this?
- Weren't there any grandparents or other family to take care of you?

238
00:30:13,671 --> 00:30:15,707
Do you think that's why?

239
00:30:16,707 --> 00:30:20,098
You think I punished him because
he was absent in my childhood.

240
00:30:20,171 --> 00:30:25,542
- Didn't you?
- I didn't punish anyone. The others...

241
00:30:26,042 --> 00:30:28,830
They didn't take their responsibility.

242
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:32,795
It was justice. There was no punishment.
Do you understand the difference?

243
00:30:33,295 --> 00:30:35,790
And Freddie Holst? Helle Anker?

244
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,755
- Consequences.
- I don't understand.

245
00:30:38,255 --> 00:30:39,862
They...

246
00:30:42,035 --> 00:30:45,035
There was a way to avoid all this.

247
00:30:45,535 --> 00:30:49,851
All the pain. All the fear. All the death.

248
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:52,035
And what is that?

249
00:30:56,318 --> 00:30:59,835
I should never have been born.

250
00:31:24,894 --> 00:31:29,931
I don't know how much you know,
but here he is. He was rescued.

251
00:31:31,926 --> 00:31:34,227
Do you want to hold him?

252
00:31:35,886 --> 00:31:37,442
No.

253
00:31:39,414 --> 00:31:41,739
I have no desire to see him.

254
00:31:42,515 --> 00:31:45,891
I can take him.

255
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,755
I'll be there shortly.

256
00:32:06,823 --> 00:32:10,419
The receipt for the payment.

257
00:32:12,535 --> 00:32:17,138
I've put in a little extra.

258
00:32:21,126 --> 00:32:25,875
I'm truly sorry for everything
that's happened. I mean that.

259
00:32:29,454 --> 00:32:35,906
Yeah. Thanks.

260
00:33:09,994 --> 00:33:14,242
I've printed your interrogation.
You need to sign it.

261
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:26,474
- You still don't want to have a lawyer?
- No.

262
00:33:31,615 --> 00:33:33,394
You knew Hans Pettersson.

263
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:39,098
Yes.

264
00:33:39,846 --> 00:33:41,346
You liked him.

265
00:33:43,858 --> 00:33:45,858
Yes.

266
00:33:46,234 --> 00:33:49,227
Did he like you?

267
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:57,778
- Yes.
- So you were friends.

268
00:33:58,278 --> 00:34:00,659
Why did you save me, then?

269
00:34:02,535 --> 00:34:04,499
I'm police.

270
00:34:09,702 --> 00:34:12,367
You wanted to die.

271
00:34:12,867 --> 00:34:17,090
I didn't want to die.
I wanted to never have been born.

272
00:34:20,606 --> 00:34:23,742
It's not really the same thing.

273
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:26,626
Do you understand?

274
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:32,490
No, you don't understand.

275
00:34:33,943 --> 00:34:39,050
You had a friend who needed you. Pen.

276
00:35:18,106 --> 00:35:21,659
As you know, Annika Melander has been
cleared, and we let Claes Sandberg go.

277
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:24,458
Did he choose to be happy?

278
00:35:27,347 --> 00:35:30,583
- Thank you for your time.
- Thank you.

279
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:33,918
- Has Lillian contacted you?
- Yeah, I'm going over there now.

280
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:36,867
Good.

281
00:35:40,259 --> 00:35:44,858
Good work. Truly. Thank you.

282
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:51,246
- Hans' funeral is tomorrow.
- Yeah, I know.

283
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:57,483
- Have you been to a funeral?
- I've been to a few. Haven't you?

284
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,282
No.

285
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:00,471
What about your sister?

286
00:36:00,971 --> 00:36:04,851
I didn't go to her funeral. I couldn't.

287
00:36:06,943 --> 00:36:10,619
- But you're going Hans' tomorrow?
- Will you come with me?

288
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,146
- Do you want me to?
- Yes.

289
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,106
Then I will.

290
00:36:20,574 --> 00:36:23,186
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

291
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:49,155
- Hi.
- Hi.

292
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:53,474
- What's this about?
- Let's take it inside.

293
00:36:55,063 --> 00:36:56,594
Thanks.

294
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:04,802
- Do you want anything?
- No, thanks.

295
00:37:04,998 --> 00:37:09,387
- Can we sit down?
- Yeah, of course.

296
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:24,746
A couple weeks ago a skeleton was
dug up in Sweden. Under a road...

297
00:37:25,246 --> 00:37:26,715
Okay, that's enough.

298
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:32,163
I'd like to just have a few days off.
Can't you give it to someone else?

299
00:37:33,271 --> 00:37:37,298
They estimate that they've been
in the ground for five to six years.

300
00:37:37,806 --> 00:37:41,114
They've managed to identify
her with the help of DNA.

301
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:43,347
- It's Alice.
- No.

302
00:37:45,798 --> 00:37:47,331
It isn't.

303
00:37:49,855 --> 00:37:53,067
No. It isn't.

304
00:37:53,911 --> 00:37:56,355
- I'm so sorry.
- It isn't.

305
00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:01,443
- We'll do everything we can...
- Hello! They're wrong, I'm telling you.

306
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:06,362
And you're wrong.

307
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:16,875
Where did my girls go?

308
00:38:17,242 --> 00:38:21,630
They fucking were together. So where
did they go if they were with her?

309
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,675
- We don't know, Henrik.
- Where was she found?

310
00:38:25,135 --> 00:38:28,347
Okay, good. We're going there. Come.

311
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:50,094
- Did they stop looking?
- They've dug everywhere.

312
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:53,547
- They aren't here, Henrik.
- They should be.

313
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:58,298
You dig for victims in different places.
There is a distance between them.

314
00:38:59,478 --> 00:39:02,498
And that they haven't found them
could mean that they're alive.

315
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:06,050
I know. That's almost worse.

316
00:40:13,998 --> 00:40:16,251
I know that you're alone.

317
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:27,554
But it was a totally ordinary day.
I went to work...

318
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:31,635
And your mother, she...

319
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:40,467
Your mother, she...

320
00:41:47,226 --> 00:41:51,539
When someone takes the life
of someone we love -

321
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:56,983
- it's easy for the heart to
become full of darkness.

322
00:41:57,483 --> 00:42:00,150
To wish that person harm.

323
00:42:00,443 --> 00:42:03,007
Anger replaces sorrow -

324
00:42:03,507 --> 00:42:07,255
- and displaces the bright
memories we have of Hans -

325
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:10,710
- and that we really need.

326
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:13,735
Hans would not have wanted that.

327
00:42:14,235 --> 00:42:18,559
He always tried, despite the work he did -

328
00:42:19,059 --> 00:42:23,094
- to see the good in every person.

329
00:42:31,762 --> 00:42:35,070
You gave him life.

330
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:43,474
Receive him in your peace.

331
00:42:46,786 --> 00:42:54,106
And give him, for Jesus Christ's sake,
a joyful resurrection.

332
00:43:17,498 --> 00:43:19,994
Bye.

333
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:28,755
Saga.

334
00:43:29,987 --> 00:43:33,083
- How are you?
- Henrik didn't come.

335
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:38,259
Oh... I thought you'd talked to him.

336
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:41,427
About what?

337
00:43:44,431 --> 00:43:48,818
Henrik Sabroe. I can't take your call right
now. Leave a name and phone number.

338
00:44:42,943 --> 00:44:44,954
They found Alice.

339
00:44:47,742 --> 00:44:50,882
I've obviously thought that
they could be dead.

340
00:44:52,447 --> 00:44:55,034
But I thought they were together.

341
00:44:55,998 --> 00:44:58,971
So whatever happened to them,
they had each other.

342
00:44:59,719 --> 00:45:02,666
Now they're without their mother.
How will they manage?

343
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:06,322
Are you using drugs?

344
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:13,715
Stimulants?

345
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:20,235
And sleeping pills to relax?

346
00:45:22,507 --> 00:45:25,755
How long have you been addicted?

347
00:45:30,298 --> 00:45:31,715
Since they disappeared.

348
00:45:32,478 --> 00:45:36,583
- Have you been on them while we've worked together?
- The whole time.

349
00:45:41,507 --> 00:45:47,023
- That's serious misconduct. Criminal.
- And one must report such things.

350
00:45:47,458 --> 00:45:49,514
Right?

351
00:45:59,103 --> 00:46:05,338
Do you remember what we talked about...
why I don't let people close to me?

352
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:08,490
Yeah.

353
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:11,811
Do you remember why?

354
00:46:15,918 --> 00:46:21,463
Because everyone, in one way or
another, has left you or hurt you.

355
00:46:45,447 --> 00:46:47,795
You're here?

356
00:46:48,295 --> 00:46:50,050
How was the funeral?

357
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:54,367
I don't know. I don't have
much to compare it to.

358
00:46:58,474 --> 00:47:00,731
I thought you'd take the day off.

359
00:47:01,731 --> 00:47:04,378
No, I need to close the case with Emil
and verify the reports.

360
00:47:04,878 --> 00:47:09,054
Emil is dead.
He killed himself in his cell.

361
00:47:12,182 --> 00:47:14,891
- How?
- He cut his wrist.

362
00:47:15,391 --> 00:47:18,275
Someone said he took a paper clip.

363
00:47:36,063 --> 00:47:39,387
Is everything okay?

364
00:47:40,762 --> 00:47:44,295
No. He took the paper clip from me.

365
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:48,251
I don't know if he took
it, or if I left it.

366
00:47:55,166 --> 00:47:57,684
Follow me.

367
00:48:16,478 --> 00:48:20,791
There was another thing
I needed to tell you.

368
00:48:21,291 --> 00:48:24,987
As you know, Kjell Grankvist has given
his inquiry over to the prosecutor.

369
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,574
Yes.

370
00:48:27,074 --> 00:48:30,231
I don't think you did
anything to your mom -

371
00:48:30,731 --> 00:48:35,550
- but one can't ignore the
technical evidence there is.

372
00:48:38,822 --> 00:48:44,858
- Are they starting an investigation?
- Only you and I know, and it doesn't need to be more than that.

373
00:48:47,483 --> 00:48:51,226
But I'm innocent. I hoped
that would be enough.

374
00:48:51,726 --> 00:48:55,931
But if I'm going to be investigated,
then I'll be removed from my duties.

375
00:48:56,431 --> 00:48:58,427
I'm very sorry.

376
00:49:01,382 --> 00:49:05,911
I had a motive, no alibi -

377
00:49:06,411 --> 00:49:08,851
- and they have technical evidence.
I'm going to be sentenced!

378
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:12,679
Let's not anticipate things.

379
00:49:14,027 --> 00:49:15,710
Saga.

380
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:19,778
Saga!

381
00:50:28,351 --> 00:50:32,474
Why? I can't give you permission to
look for them on your own.

382
00:50:33,994 --> 00:50:36,722
- Can't you give me a leave of absence?
- No.

383
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:43,130
Okay. I quit. I'll send
something to you in writing.

384
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:59,978
John? Is Saga here?

385
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,155
You haven't heard?

386
00:51:05,402 --> 00:51:07,010
Heard what?

387
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,635
Saga, it's me!

388
00:51:33,391 --> 00:51:35,355
Saga!

389
00:51:38,503 --> 00:51:40,217
Saga.

390
00:53:10,398 --> 00:53:11,898
Hey, Wiki.

391
00:53:22,327 --> 00:53:23,827
What are you doing here again?

392
00:53:36,775 --> 00:53:38,275
I quit.

393
00:53:40,518 --> 00:53:42,771
I really like my job.

394
00:53:43,231 --> 00:53:47,259
It's not like with you, but
I like being an investigator.

395
00:53:51,222 --> 00:53:52,971
But that's not all I am.

396
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:06,914
I was first Alice's husband, and
I was a father to two girls.

397
00:54:07,686 --> 00:54:09,291
And that was taken from me.

398
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:18,411
And now you think everything has been
taken from you? You know what? Fuck that.

399
00:54:19,278 --> 00:54:21,315
Because you're not just going to give up.

400
00:54:30,295 --> 00:54:34,226
Saga, I really need you.

401
00:54:40,974 --> 00:54:45,795
You won't give up, because I know we
can find my daughters. You and me. Okay?

402
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:50,331
- Stay there!
- Saga...

403
00:54:50,831 --> 00:54:52,086
Stay there!

404
00:54:52,586 --> 00:54:54,539
- Don't do it!
- Stay there!

405
00:54:55,322 --> 00:54:56,835
Saga.

406
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,842
Saga! Do you hear what I'm telling you?

407
00:55:01,806 --> 00:55:03,554
I need you!

408
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:09,242
Saga!

409
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,059
Look at this.

410
00:57:02,983 --> 00:57:07,394
A car was stolen the morning they
disappeared. Ten minutes from our house.

411
00:57:13,422 --> 00:57:14,922
Are you coming?

412
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:19,610
- It's a six-year-old car theft.
- Is that it?

413
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:24,007
Even if we find it, the chance that
it will lead to anything is minimal.

414
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:26,594
Yeah. I know that.

415
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:32,306
But I have nothing else to do. Do you?

416
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:36,190
No.

417
00:58:01,447 --> 00:58:08,050
