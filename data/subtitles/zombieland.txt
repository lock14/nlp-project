1
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,551
<i>Oh, America.</i>

2
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,594
<i>I wish I could tell you
that this was still America,</i>

3
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:35,590
<i>but I've come to realize that you
can't have a country without people.</i>

4
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:39,561
<i>And there are no people here.</i>

5
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:47,445
No! No!

6
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:54,112
Go back... Fuck! Aah!

7
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:57,789
<i>No, my friends.</i>

8
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,153
<i>This is now the
United States of Zombieland.</i>

9
00:01:05,364 --> 00:01:10,462
<i>It's amazing how quickly things
can go from bad to total shit storm.</i>

10
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,003
<i>And why am I alive when everyone
around me has turned to meat?</i>

11
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:17,001
<i>It's because of my list of rules.</i>

12
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,373
<i>Rule #1 for surviving Zombieland: Cardio</i>

13
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:23,382
Fuck!

14
00:01:23,582 --> 00:01:26,108
<i>When the virus struck,
for obvious reasons,</i>

15
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,650
<i>the first ones to go were the fatties.</i>

16
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,549
<i>Poor fat bastard.</i>

17
00:01:36,728 --> 00:01:39,289
<i>But as the infection spread
and the chaos grew,</i>

18
00:01:39,498 --> 00:01:41,990
<i>it wasn't enough to just
be fast on your feet.</i>

19
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,966
<i>You had to get a gun
and learn how to use it.</i>

20
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:48,640
<i>Which leads me to my 2nd rule:
The Double Tap.</i>

21
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,840
<i>In those moments when you're not sure
the undead are really "dead" dead</i>

22
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:57,015
<i>don't get all stingy
with your bullets.</i>

23
00:01:57,216 --> 00:01:58,979
<i>I mean, 1 more clean shot to the head</i>

24
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:05,823
<i>and this lady could have avoided
becoming a human Happy Meal.</i>

25
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,823
<i>Woulda, coulda, shoulda.</i>

26
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:11,587
<i>Wasn't long before the zombies
began to get clever.</i>

27
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,097
<i>When you're at your most vulnerable,
somehow they could just smell it.</i>

28
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,532
Can't a guy take a dumper in peace?

29
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,510
<i>Don't let them catch you
with your pants down.</i>

30
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:28,604
<i>Rule #3: Beware of bathrooms.</i>

31
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,849
<i>As zombies began to outnumber humans,</i>

32
00:02:34,052 --> 00:02:36,954
<i>well, that's when you had
to cut all emotional ties.</i>

33
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:40,718
<i>If the girls in your neighborhood
are now fucked-up little monsters,</i>

34
00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:44,889
<i>well, maybe it's time
to stop driving carpool.</i>

35
00:02:50,235 --> 00:02:52,602
<i>You had to focus on your own survival,</i>

36
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,534
<i>which leads to rule #4, pretty basic,</i>

37
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:08,050
<i>Fasten your seat belts.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.</i>

38
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:57,759
<i>That guy down there is me.
I'm in Garland, Texas.</i>

39
00:04:57,963 --> 00:05:01,593
<i>And it may look like zombies destroyed it,
but that's actually just Garland.</i>

40
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,100
<i>It's been two months since patient zero
took a bite of a contaminated burger</i>

41
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,567
<i>at a Gas N' Gulp.</i>

42
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:11,004
<i>Just two months, and I might be the
last non-cannibal freak in the country.</i>

43
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:13,177
<i>I may seem like an unlikely survivor,</i>

44
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,610
<i>with all my phobias and
irritable-bowel syndrome,</i>

45
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:21,048
<i>but I had the advantage of never
having any friends or any close family.</i>

46
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:25,019
<i>I survive because I play it safe
and follow the rules.</i>

47
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:26,519
<i>My rules.</i>

48
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,582
Shit.

49
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,264
Of course.

50
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,832
Motherfucker.

51
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:10,461
<i>On the bright side, I had
found a place to go # 2.</i>

52
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:18,634
<i>Another rule to surviving Zombieland
#7: Travel light.</i>

53
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:20,637
<i>And I don't mean just luggage.</i>

54
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,670
<i>I've always been kind of a loner.</i>

55
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,843
<i>I avoided people like they were zombies</i>

56
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:26,704
<i>even before they were zombies.</i>

57
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:30,279
<i>Now that they are all zombies,
I kind of miss people.</i>

58
00:07:31,216 --> 00:07:33,879
<i>So I'm on my way from
my college dorm in Austin, Texas</i>

59
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:37,987
<i>to Columbus, Ohio, where I'm
hoping my parents are still alive.</i>

60
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,158
<i>Even though we were never really close</i>

61
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:43,088
<i>it would be nice to see
a familiar face, or any face,</i>

62
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:47,163
<i>that doesn't have blood dripping from
its lips and flesh between its teeth.</i>

63
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,013
Thank you.

64
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,729
What are you looking for?
Nothing.

65
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,763
I just... I just have this list.

66
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:30,491
No one back there but my duffel bag.

67
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:35,165
What's your name?

68
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,466
Stop. No names.

69
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,701
Keeps us from getting too familiar.

70
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:44,837
You almost knocked over your
alcohol with your knife.

71
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:48,144
That's okay, you don't have to...
So where you headed?

72
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,447
Uh... Columbus. You?

73
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,159
Tallahassee.

74
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:02,625
No, one for me. One and done,
I always say. I said that once.

75
00:10:03,702 --> 00:10:08,663
You know, Tallahassee and
Columbus are both, uh, east.

76
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,067
So?

77
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,533
So, Tallahassee,
you wanna stick together?

78
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:17,648
Least for a while?
Here's the deal, Columbus. Uh...

79
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,143
I'm not easy to get along with,

80
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:22,650
and I'm sensing you're a bit of a bitch

81
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,390
so I give this relationship
to about Texarkana.

82
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:30,687
Really? Yeah.
You'll take me as far as Texarkana.

83
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:32,615
You're a peppy little
spit-fuck, aren't you?

84
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,606
You might wanna buckle up for safety.

85
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:41,001
I can tell already you are
gonna get on my nerves.

86
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,066
<i>Even though teaming up
wasn't my style,</i>

87
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:46,403
<i>I figured I'd be safer with Tallahassee.</i>

88
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:49,080
<i>You see, he was in the
ass-kicking business, and...</i>

89
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,077
Business is good.

90
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:56,481
<i>It became quickly apparent, however,
that he did have one weakness.</i>

91
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,081
What are we doing here?

92
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:00,553
Well, take a look. It's a
goddamn Hostess truck.

93
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:04,024
Yeah, I see that, a Hostess truck.
So what?

94
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,595
I could use a Twinkie.

95
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:16,698
You coming?
Yes. Yeah. One second.

96
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:22,979
Are you fucking with me?
- ...No.

97
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,145
You should actually limber up as well.

98
00:11:26,351 --> 00:11:28,320
Especially if we are going down that hill.

99
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:29,782
It is very important.

100
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,549
I don't believe in it.

101
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:35,215
You ever see a lion limber up
before it takes down a gazelle?

102
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:01,582
Sno Balls? Yeah.

103
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,615
Sno Balls?

104
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,924
Where's the fucking Twinkies?

105
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,985
I like Sno Balls.

106
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,164
I hate coconut.
Not the taste, consistency.

107
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:15,424
Fresh.

108
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:21,000
This Twinkie thing, it ain't over yet.

109
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:26,869
Hey, this may be a bad time,

110
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,376
but I gotta take the Browns
to the Super Bowl.

111
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,048
Really? Really.

112
00:12:37,722 --> 00:12:40,692
<i>I know, again, so soon? What can I say?</i>

113
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,225
<i>I have a case of, uh, chronic anxiety.</i>

114
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:52,230
<i>Truth is, I was always kind of phobic.
I found lots of things disturbing.</i>

115
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:55,895
<i>Like undertow or department store Santas.</i>

116
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,609
<i>Being alone with a baby.</i>

117
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:03,477
<i>But the thing I fear more than
anything, yes, even more than zombies,</i>

118
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,711
<i>fucking clowns.</i>

119
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:12,190
<i>When you're afraid of
everything that's out there,</i>

120
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,654
<i>you quit going out there,</i>

121
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,327
<i>which is what happened
to me before Zombieland.</i>

122
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,393
<i>Friday night, third
straight week indoors.</i>

123
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,397
<i>"World of Warcraft",</i>

124
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:25,695
<i>leaning tower of pizza boxes,</i>

125
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:27,929
<i>Code Red Mountain Dew.</i>

126
00:13:28,173 --> 00:13:30,232
<i>Pride, nowhere.</i>

127
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,102
<i>Dignity, long gone.</i>

128
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,870
<i>Virginity, totally justifiable
to speculate on.</i>

129
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,842
Smooth.

130
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:39,711
<i>My whole life, all I'd ever wanted
was to find a girl,</i>

131
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:43,286
<i>and fall in love, bring her home
to meet the folks.</i>

132
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,389
<i>Then again, since my folks are a
couple of paranoid shut-ins like me,</i>

133
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:49,059
<i>maybe this girl could
bring me home to her folks.</i>

134
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:53,629
<i>And then I'd finally be a member
of a cool, functional family.</i>

135
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,697
408.

136
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,870
Please, is anyone home?
Please, it's an emergency.

137
00:13:59,404 --> 00:14:02,033
<i>I don't usually unlock my door
to the sounds of panic,</i>

138
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,140
<i>but my neighbor 406 is insanely hot.</i>

139
00:14:04,342 --> 00:14:05,741
Okay, okay.

140
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,582
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

141
00:14:13,785 --> 00:14:15,413
Nice to meet you.

142
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,820
Here.

143
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,221
There you go.

144
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,331
Mountain Dew? Yeah. Code Red.

145
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:35,234
And here's some Golden Grahams.
The Ziploc bag keeps them crisp.

146
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,265
Okay. Keep that there.

147
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,835
So, um, tell me what happened.

148
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:46,647
He was homeless and... And sick.

149
00:14:46,851 --> 00:14:49,684
And I was walking home from the bar,
talking on my phone,

150
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,915
and then he just came
sprinting towards me.

151
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:57,220
I mean, not running, sprinting.

152
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:01,431
And I thought, you know, like,
maybe he was running from someone,

153
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:06,866
or after someone, but last time I saw
he was still out there going crazy.

154
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,163
Drugs, maybe?

155
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,668
I didn't even tell you the worst part.

156
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,639
Yeah?

157
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,605
He tried to bite me.

158
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:25,283
You're right, that's the worst part.
I'm sorry. I'm just so scared.

159
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:29,450
No, no, no, you should be scared.
A homeless man just tried to eat you.

160
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,062
That's the right kind of scared.
That's reasonable scared.

161
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:36,028
I get scared for things that, like, don't make
sense at all, like clowns with red noses,

162
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,293
or, like, the rags they
use to wipe down tables

163
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,734
when you finish eating
at a chain restaurant.

164
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,567
Really?

165
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:46,504
Look, the point is
I am here for you, okay?

166
00:15:46,711 --> 00:15:50,169
And as long as you are by my side,
I am not leaving this apartment.

167
00:15:50,381 --> 00:15:52,975
Do you mind if I just close
my eyes for a minute?

168
00:15:53,184 --> 00:15:54,846
No, of course. Of course.

169
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:57,578
Thank you. Okay.

170
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,921
<i>Set aside the feverish,
homeless cannibal,</i>

171
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,025
<i>I'm living the dream.</i>

172
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:05,253
<i>I had always, my whole life,</i>

173
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:09,058
<i>wanted to brush a girl's
hair over her ear.</i>

174
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:12,033
Good night. Good night.

175
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,914
...my God.

176
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,682
Are you okay?

177
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,192
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

178
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:38,057
Okay, okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop.

179
00:16:39,163 --> 00:16:40,687
What are you doing?

180
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:50,730
Look, stay back, 406, okay?
I don't wanna hurt you, but,

181
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:52,240
Shit.

182
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:06,651
...my God, I'm so fucking sorry.

183
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,163
<i>You see, you just can't trust anyone.</i>

184
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:51,034
<i>The first time I let a girl into my life
and she tries to eat me.</i>

185
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,711
Please. Listen to me.

186
00:18:08,953 --> 00:18:10,854
406.

187
00:18:11,222 --> 00:18:13,054
If you're in there,

188
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,528
you're just sick. Okay?

189
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:36,872
<i>That was my first brush with the
plague of the 21st century.</i>

190
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,640
<i>Remember mad cow disease?</i>

191
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:42,150
<i>Well, mad cow became mad
person became mad zombie.</i>

192
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:46,381
<i>It's a fast-acting virus that left you
with a swollen brain, a raging fever,</i>

193
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,559
<i>that made you hateful, violent,</i>

194
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:51,557
<i>and gave you a really, really
bad case of the munchies.</i>

195
00:18:51,762 --> 00:18:53,753
All right, you steer, I'll push.

196
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:56,693
...Okay.

197
00:18:58,069 --> 00:18:59,502
Okay.

198
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,537
I've heard there's a place
that's untouched by this crap.

199
00:19:04,742 --> 00:19:05,767
Back east, yeah?

200
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,417
Yeah. Yeah.
You heard the same thing?

201
00:19:07,778 --> 00:19:11,909
Out west, we hear it's back east.
Back east, they hear it's out west.

202
00:19:12,116 --> 00:19:14,914
It's all just nonsense.

203
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,587
You know, you're like a
penguin on the North Pole

204
00:19:17,788 --> 00:19:20,916
who hears the South Pole
is really nice this time of year.

205
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,788
There are no penguins
on the North Pole.

206
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,530
You wanna feel how
hard I can punch?

207
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:30,964
So, what do you think?

208
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,637
Wait, the last time I laid some pipe?

209
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:37,365
Last time you went 20 toes,
put Percy in the playpen?

210
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,576
Who's Percy?

211
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:41,108
Wallpapered the closet,
passed the gravy.

212
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:44,441
Went heels to Jesus.  Oh, made love.

213
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,378
Well, just sex.

214
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,221
Three weeks ago. Yeah.

215
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,253
In the back of an abandoned FedEx truck.

216
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:57,755
Shut up. No, no, I was headed east.

217
00:19:57,962 --> 00:20:00,056
She, west.

218
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,392
And we took shelter
in the back of the truck.

219
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,569
It was full of undelivered packages.
What was her name?

220
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,670
Beverly.

221
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,999
Beverly Hills.

222
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,334
You dog.

223
00:20:12,944 --> 00:20:14,913
So, what about you?

224
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,113
Me? l... l...

225
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:20,840
Aye, aye, aye.

226
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,116
Oh, my God. It makes you sick.

227
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,089
You know, it makes you sad,
it makes you...

228
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:33,752
It makes you think if you can go back
to the way things were right now,

229
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:35,193
you know, you'd be...

230
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,563
You'd be out in the backyard,
you know, trying to catch fireflies.

231
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:41,165
And instead this.

232
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:47,034
I mean, it makes you... Hungry.

233
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,804
I'm worried about you.

234
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:51,982
Look, whatever you have
waiting for you in Columbus,

235
00:20:52,183 --> 00:20:56,677
I promise you it ain't prettier than
our friend here enjoying her Manwich.

236
00:21:04,128 --> 00:21:07,496
<i>Tallahassee had a sick sense
of humor when it came to zombies.</i>

237
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:11,099
<i>Zombies aren't the most lovable
creatures, but he really hated them.</i>

238
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:15,500
<i>The only thing he was more obsessed with
than killing zombies, was finding a Twinkie.</i>

239
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,528
<i>Something about a Twinkie reminded
him of a time not so long ago,</i>

240
00:21:19,553 --> 00:21:23,071
<i>when things were simple
and not so fucking psychotic.</i>

241
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:26,512
<i>It was like if he got a taste
of that comforting childhood treat,</i>

242
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,198
<i>the world would
become innocent again,</i>

243
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,844
<i>and everything would
return to normal.</i>

244
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,750
What, are you prospecting?

245
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:34,684
Jesus Christ.

246
00:21:35,426 --> 00:21:36,758
You are a dangerous man.

247
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:41,329
You're gonna risk our
lives for a Twinkie?

248
00:21:41,532 --> 00:21:44,330
There is a box of Twinkies
in that grocery store.

249
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,333
Not just any box of Twinkies.

250
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:51,531
The last box of Twinkies that anyone
will enjoy in the whole universe.

251
00:21:51,742 --> 00:21:54,540
Believe it or not,
Twinkies have an expiration date.

252
00:21:55,713 --> 00:22:01,674
Someday very soon, life's little
Twinkie gauge is gonna go empty.

253
00:22:02,586 --> 00:22:05,521
Time to nut up or shut up.

254
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,717
<i>When Tallahassee goes Hulk on a zombie</i>

255
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,760

257
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,894
<i>What can I say? It's like...
It's like art.</i>

258
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:38,579
You got a pretty mouth.

259
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,630
Don't swing, don't swing.

260
00:22:51,135 --> 00:22:52,693
Swing.

261
00:22:57,742 --> 00:22:59,711
Thank you. You owe me.

262
00:23:01,645 --> 00:23:03,238
Yeah.

263
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:04,574
You're incredible.

264
00:23:04,782 --> 00:23:06,147
I know. Yeah.

265
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:09,751
Twinkie, Twinkie, Twinkie, Twinkie.

266
00:23:10,955 --> 00:23:12,445
Big Hoss.

267
00:23:18,829 --> 00:23:21,923
- Come here, big fella.
- Just gonna take a little off the top.

268
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,866
Wow, these fellas really
let themselves go.

269
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:34,106
And they're so fat.

270
00:23:34,311 --> 00:23:36,507
I think we should probably
just keep going.

271
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:42,811
<i>All I could think of was,
what are the odds?</i>

272
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,548
<i>Another marriageable woman
to bring home to the folks.</i>

273
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:47,951
Come quick.

274
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:52,296
<i>Someone's ear is in danger

275
00:23:54,865 --> 00:23:56,333
Hey.

276
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:58,633
I'll catch up.

277
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:04,537
<i>When in doubt, know your way out.</i>

278
00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:16,747
They're sisters.
The little one's been bitten.

279
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:19,184
Act normal. Try not to freak her out.

280
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,086
Yeah.

281
00:24:22,626 --> 00:24:25,095
Columbus, Wichita, Little Rock.

282
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:29,833
So you did all this for a Twinkie?

283
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:35,101
No, no, no, he did. I'm just kind of
like a Sancho Panza character.

284
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,400
Look, I don't think she has long.

285
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:43,740
Yeah, I know. I know, and she knows.
We're just looking for a way out.

286
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,574
No, no, no, no. She's just a little girl.

287
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,718
Don't talk about me like I'm not here.

288
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,752
Right, sorry. Um...

289
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:57,554
Look, I know that you're really sick.

290
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,088
But, your sister wants me to...

291
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,823
It's not her decision, okay?
It's mine.

292
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:04,898
I made her promise.

293
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:09,568
We already said goodbye,
but, um, we didn't have a gun.

294
00:25:09,974 --> 00:25:13,342
We don't know that there's no cure.
You're just gutless!

295
00:25:14,578 --> 00:25:15,704
Give him the gun.

296
00:25:32,663 --> 00:25:35,394
Wait, wait, wait.

297
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:39,294
I'll do it.

298
00:25:56,954 --> 00:25:59,890
I love you. I love you too.

299
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:11,259
You need some help?

300
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:14,163
Now that you mention it,

301
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,965
we'll take your weapons, your
car keys, your ammunition.

302
00:26:17,174 --> 00:26:20,405
- And if you've got it, sugarless gum.
- What the fuck?

303
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:24,212
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, why are you guys doing this?

304
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,541
Better you make the
mistake of trusting us

305
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,809
than us make the mistake of trusting you.

306
00:26:31,655 --> 00:26:34,089
<i>The first hot girl in
1 000 miles shows up,</i>

307
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:35,412
<i>makes me feel like an idiot,</i>

308
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:39,654
<i>steals my double-barrel and then says
I'm the one that can't be trusted.</i>

309
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,297
Nice going, genius.

310
00:26:45,502 --> 00:26:47,471
You're the one that gave her the gun.

311
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:50,231
Those guys were dumb.

312
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,209
Avoid the vanity mirror.

313
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,675
Relax, okay?
I just passed for a zombie.

314
00:26:58,782 --> 00:27:02,583
What I'd give for a shower...
Do not say S-H-O-W-E-R, okay?

315
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,647
Let's just get where we're going.

316
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,654
So do you think it's true?
Is what true?

317
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:10,851
You know, about Pacific Playland?

318
00:27:11,061 --> 00:27:15,020
Totally zombie-free.
Only place west of Waco.

319
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,500
Trust me.

320
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:23,271
So he's on one of these serious
Tour de France bikes...

321
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:25,601
You know, with, like,
the toeholds, right?

322
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:30,769
And he's pedaling, and the zombie's
head is, like, caught in the gear.

323
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:34,712
You know, with the hair in the
chain just, like, going around.

324
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,682
Ho. Very cool.

325
00:27:36,887 --> 00:27:41,790
But zombie kill of the week?
No, sir.

326
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:45,894
I saw this construction worker.
I shit you not,

327
00:27:46,096 --> 00:27:49,463
he is on a steamroller, and a
zombie goes down in front of him.

328
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:52,228
You ever roll a tube of toothpaste up
from the bottom?

329
00:27:52,436 --> 00:27:54,165
Yeah. I always roll it
up from the bottom.

330
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,806
Well, the zombie's head is the cap.

331
00:27:57,041 --> 00:28:00,307
Are you one of these guys that tries
to one-up everybody else's story?

332
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:04,641
No. I knew a guy way
worse at that than me.

333
00:28:04,848 --> 00:28:06,874
All right, let's just try to find a car.

334
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,108
...Which reminds me,

335
00:28:08,318 --> 00:28:11,288
I never had headaches like this
till your ass came onboard.

336
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:15,982
I mean, do what you want with a man,
but do not fuck with his Cadillac.

337
00:28:16,193 --> 00:28:17,422
Hey, there's a nice minivan.

338
00:28:17,628 --> 00:28:20,153
You know something?
That is nice.

339
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,662
That's a beautiful van.

340
00:28:23,934 --> 00:28:26,961
<i>Tallahassee believes you have
to blow off steam in Zombieland</i>

341
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,766
<i>or else you lose what's
left of your mind.</i>

342
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:33,239
<i>If it makes him happy and keeps him
from using that crowbar on me,</i>

343
00:28:33,444 --> 00:28:35,970
<i>then I say, "Hey, go ape shit. "</i>

344
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:38,172
I want my Caddy back!

345
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:42,144
Stupid little bitches!

346
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,685
I think I pulled something.

347
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:56,096
Think the two of us are smart enough
to come up with a con like that?

348
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,432
You hesitated.

349
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:08,602
Is it better to be smart or lucky?

350
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:12,073
Look at what we got here.

351
00:29:18,522 --> 00:29:20,457
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

352
00:29:34,338 --> 00:29:35,532
Come on.

353
00:29:40,144 --> 00:29:42,613
That's nice. Smell the finger?

354
00:29:46,817 --> 00:29:48,410
Yes.

355
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,817
Thank God for rednecks.

356
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:58,494
This is a really big truck

357
00:29:58,695 --> 00:30:03,429
and these are really big guns.

358
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:05,259
Take your time.

359
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:30,785
You know, they say,
"He who seeks revenge

360
00:30:30,994 --> 00:30:32,791
should remember to dig two graves."

361
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:37,161
Right. Two graves. One for the big
chick, one for the little chick.

362
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:38,763
You are scary happy.

363
00:30:41,972 --> 00:30:45,135
Come on, why don't we just forget
about those girls and head home?

364
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,538
Oh, you want to talk about home?

365
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:53,040
For me, home was a puppy named Buck.

366
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,582
Cutest dog ever.

367
00:31:02,993 --> 00:31:05,291
All those fucking zombies.

368
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,387
I lost him.

369
00:31:08,232 --> 00:31:13,693
And there ain't no getting him back,
so, uh, I'm looking for a new home.

370
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:18,803
Tomorrow, I may be skinny-dipping
in the Yellowstone River,

371
00:31:19,042 --> 00:31:22,500
or swinging from the chandeliers
in the Playboy Mansion,

372
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:27,115
but today, a Vortec
six-fucking-liter V8,

373
00:31:27,317 --> 00:31:31,015
a box full of hollow points,
and, Lord willing, a GD Twinkie.

374
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:35,481
Gotta enjoy the little things.

375
00:31:37,394 --> 00:31:40,364
<i>I hate to give credit to anyone
who looks like Yosemite Sam,</i>

376
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,963
<i>but I'm writing it down.</i>

377
00:31:42,165 --> 00:31:44,634
<i>Enjoy the little things.</i>

378
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:55,003
Knowing them, it's a trap.

379
00:31:55,212 --> 00:31:58,546
Wait here. Drive down if I signal.

380
00:31:58,782 --> 00:32:00,842
You're not gonna shoot them, are you?

381
00:32:01,051 --> 00:32:03,748
Not unless they shoot at me.

382
00:32:04,087 --> 00:32:07,022
Oh, let's hope they shoot at me.

383
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,775
Looks like they hoofed it.

384
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,276
Probably headed west.

385
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,448
Just drive slow,
keep your eyes peeled.

386
00:33:04,648 --> 00:33:06,377
Sure.

387
00:33:10,153 --> 00:33:12,122
They're in the back, aren't they?
Just me.

388
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,820
I'm really sorry.
She was like a crouching tiger.

389
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:20,320
You got taken hostage
by a 12-year-old?

390
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:24,057
Girls mature faster than boys. She's
way ahead of where I was at that age.

391
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:27,362
Twelve's the new 20. Gun, please.

392
00:33:27,571 --> 00:33:29,767
Like you would ever use that thing.

393
00:33:29,973 --> 00:33:32,909
Don't kill me with my own gun!

394
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:34,771
All those violent video games.

395
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:36,741
Yeah. Thank you.

396
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,643
Now honk your horn. What?

397
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,180
Honk it.

398
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,780
It's your sister, with my gun. Hello.

399
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,493
Bummer.

400
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,932
Now step away from the vehicle.

401
00:33:59,436 --> 00:34:01,803
You get to ride shotgun.

402
00:34:09,012 --> 00:34:10,844
<i>I kind of like this girl.</i>

403
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:14,246
<i>She's not your typical hot,
stuck-up bitch.</i>

404
00:34:14,818 --> 00:34:19,380
<i>Even before Zombieland, Wichita was
running the table on guys like us.</i>

405
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:35,135
What are you looking for?

406
00:34:35,338 --> 00:34:37,273
My engagement ring.

407
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:42,041
I took it off to pump my gas, and I
thought that I put it in my purse,

408
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:45,373
but it must've fallen out,
and I'm late for my flight and...

409
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:49,643
Well, listen, I'll find your ring,
and I'll FedEx it to you.

410
00:34:50,153 --> 00:34:51,621
I'll give you a reward.

411
00:34:51,822 --> 00:34:53,016
Ha. Don't be silly.

412
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:57,159
Three thousand dollars.
It's worth more than my car.

413
00:34:58,161 --> 00:34:59,686
Just give me your number.

414
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:02,827
Yeah. I'll find it.

415
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,358
I'll start looking for it right now.

416
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,800
Because I got nothing else to do.

417
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:09,905
I was engaged once,

418
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,302
but I'm single now.

419
00:35:14,744 --> 00:35:16,143
Bye-bye.

420
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,313
Hope you make your flight.

421
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,925
No, but I know it's
around here somewhere.

422
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:31,492
She's on a plane,
that's the beauty of it.

423
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,688
Let me call you back.

424
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,391
Hey, you found my ring.

425
00:35:40,237 --> 00:35:42,706
Thanks. I've been looking all over for it.

426
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:45,101
Your ring?
Well, it's my friend's, you know.

427
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,971
I'm gonna send it to her.
Do I get a reward?

428
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:53,072
Forty, 60, 80, 400.

429
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:56,219
That's it. That's the whole register.

430
00:35:58,655 --> 00:36:00,088
You made someone very happy.

431
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:02,750
You too.

432
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:12,068
Nice.

433
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,130
How many left?

434
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,103
Let me see.

435
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:21,369
Enough for us to get to California.

436
00:36:22,445 --> 00:36:23,726
Someday, I want a ring this big.

437
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,579
For the low price of 30 bucks, sold.

438
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:31,954
<i>It's amazing how far you can get
with some costume jewelry</i>

439
00:36:32,155 --> 00:36:33,588
<i>and a cutthroat attitude.</i>

440
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,885
<i>I guess we're just lucky they didn't
leave us by the side of the road.</i>

441
00:36:39,496 --> 00:36:41,396
Thank you, Wichita.
Thanks, Little Rock.

442
00:36:46,836 --> 00:36:50,101
For fuck's sake, enough already! We're
being chased by ravenous freaks!

443
00:36:50,307 --> 00:36:52,275
We don't have enough problems?

444
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:55,445
"They stole my Hummer. We have
trust issues." Get over it, okay?

445
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,286
We can't just fucking
drive down the road,

446
00:36:57,309 --> 00:37:00,905
playing I Spy or some shit for
hours like 4 normal-ass Americans?

447
00:37:01,318 --> 00:37:02,615
Fuck me!

448
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,780
I know.

449
00:37:06,856 --> 00:37:08,347
Let me be the mature one.

450
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,291
Good.

451
00:37:22,672 --> 00:37:25,369
So where are you guys headed?

452
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,771
Pacific Playland.

453
00:37:27,978 --> 00:37:29,206
The amusement park?

454
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:32,711
Wait, outside L.A.?
Yeah. We went there as kids.

455
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:34,817
That place totally blows.

456
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,545
My mind. It's... It's so fun.

457
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,452
Just good entertainment
for the whole family.

458
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:44,525
Yeah, no, actually,
I went there as a kid too.

459
00:37:44,728 --> 00:37:46,822
In fact, this
probably counts as off-season.

460
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:49,498
Well, did you guys hear?
There are no zombies there.

461
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:51,030
Yeah, we heard. Uh...

462
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:56,137
You know what, I may not shoot you, but
you have still royally pissed me off,

463
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,969
and I'm not going to play
with you at Pacific Playland.

464
00:38:01,878 --> 00:38:04,472
Don't worry, he grows on you.
Really?

465
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:06,206
No. It gets worse.

466
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:08,817
Okay. How about we play the quiet game?

467
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:10,487
Yeah? Starting now.

468
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,157
I've actually been meaning to ask you:

469
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:17,639
Did you hear anything
about,  Columbus, Ohio?

470
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,059
You never played the quiet game?
Sorry.

471
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,391
No? Well, they're playing
it in Columbus, Ohio.

472
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:25,693
It's a total ghost town.
It's burned to the ground.

473
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:35,570
You're Columbus.

474
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:38,545
I'm sorry.

475
00:38:38,748 --> 00:38:41,273
I didn't realize it was...

476
00:38:42,085 --> 00:38:45,385
<i>that my family is gone,</i>

477
00:38:45,588 --> 00:38:49,422
<i>or the realization that I never really
had much of a family to begin with.</i>

478
00:38:49,626 --> 00:38:53,585
<i>Either way, I can't pretend that whatever
I'm looking for I'll find by going home.</i>

479
00:38:53,797 --> 00:38:55,697
<i>I have no home.</i>

480
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:01,661
We can, uh, get you a ride.

481
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:06,135
You know, you can go see for yourself,

482
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,744
or settle somewhere new.

483
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:10,777
Okay.

484
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,384
<i>I could tell she knew
what I was feeling.</i>

485
00:39:14,918 --> 00:39:17,911
<i>We were all orphans in Zombieland.</i>

486
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:34,436
I know this Pacific
Playland thing is nuts,

487
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:39,965
but it's just been so long
since she got to be a kid.

488
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,972
Yeah, it's tough growing
up in Zombieland.

489
00:39:43,179 --> 00:39:45,512
It's tough growing up.

490
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:52,318
There.

491
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,320
You could take that truck.

492
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:03,657
Well, l, uh, hope you find
whoever it is you're looking for.

493
00:40:05,702 --> 00:40:09,036
And don't let go, once you do.

494
00:40:22,152 --> 00:40:24,985
<i>It wasn't just because
I had nowhere else to go.</i>

495
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:28,851
<i>It was because, in that
moment, it became clear.</i>

496
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:33,496
<i>Wherever this girl was,
that's where I wanted to be.</i>

497
00:40:52,081 --> 00:40:56,815
Man, we're gonna have to pull
over soon. I'm feeling cooped up.

498
00:40:57,086 --> 00:41:00,146
"Wantum your wampum."
Yeah. That'll work.

499
00:41:00,356 --> 00:41:02,222
Okay, but what the hell are we doing?

500
00:41:02,425 --> 00:41:04,985
Just humor him. Trust me.

501
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,940
Hold up.

502
00:41:19,342 --> 00:41:21,208
Who wants to go first?

503
00:41:21,411 --> 00:41:24,744
<i>I really, really wanna impress Wichita,</i>

504
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,076
<i>but it would be in violation of rule 17,</i>

505
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:31,219
<i>- maybe the most important rule
- Don't be a hero.</i>

506
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:35,085
- Why don't you take this one?
- Don't mind if I do.

507
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,804
What do you think?
Zombie kill of the week?

508
00:41:52,342 --> 00:41:55,244
<i>Close, but no cigar.
Zombie kill of the week</i>

509
00:41:55,445 --> 00:41:57,880
<i>goes to Sister Cynthia Knickerbocker.</i>

510
00:42:03,019 --> 00:42:04,418
<i>Poor flat bastard.</i>

511
00:42:27,277 --> 00:42:28,744
Perfume? What?

512
00:42:28,945 --> 00:42:30,277
Is that perfume?

513
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:33,449
...It's cologne.

514
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:34,675
I'm thinking,

515
00:42:36,085 --> 00:42:37,143
Lancôme Magnifique.

516
00:42:37,353 --> 00:42:39,083
Why don't you speak up a little?

517
00:42:39,289 --> 00:42:41,780
I think they might have
missed it in Santa Fe.

518
00:42:44,027 --> 00:42:45,585
Oh, my God.

519
00:42:45,795 --> 00:42:47,422
All right. Okay.

520
00:42:48,331 --> 00:42:50,994
You're thinking about
fucking Wichita.

521
00:42:52,168 --> 00:42:55,695
Wish granted. She spent
the last 24 hours fucking us both.

522
00:42:56,739 --> 00:42:57,967
Hey.

523
00:42:59,842 --> 00:43:01,538
Good luck now, Petunia.

524
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:11,577
Okay. Let me begin
my three-part apology

525
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,469
by saying that I think you're a
wonderful human with great potential.

526
00:43:14,492 --> 00:43:19,862
It's okay, but FYI, I beat wholesale
ass for a lot less than that.

527
00:43:20,563 --> 00:43:25,126
I'm sure.
You get, uh, 45 percent power.

528
00:43:25,335 --> 00:43:26,666
Thank you.

529
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:31,039
Yeah. Come on, break another one.

530
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:36,938
Nice.

531
00:43:39,782 --> 00:43:41,010
Doesn't that feel good?

532
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:34,067
<i>Sometimes, Tallahassee's right.
You gotta enjoy the little things,</i>

533
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:37,570
<i>even if that means destroying
a whole lot of little things.</i>

534
00:44:41,577 --> 00:44:43,739
Smells like perfume.

535
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,947
You don't know
who Willie Nelson is?

536
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:49,550
No.

537
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:51,985
Willie Nelson?

538
00:44:52,188 --> 00:44:54,088
Yeah, no, I don't.

539
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:58,893
Yeah, I shave every morning, but
sometimes by like 4:30, I'll have a thing.

540
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,965
It's called 5:00 shadow, but
sometimes I'll get it prematurely.

541
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:06,101
Since it's a freeway, you can get it up
to, like, 65, but don't go more than 75.

542
00:45:06,302 --> 00:45:10,000
You don't wanna go more than 20.
Don't worry about a blind spot.

543
00:45:10,206 --> 00:45:12,175
Blind spots are for other drivers.

544
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,003
It's like the first time
that I've ever driven.

545
00:45:15,211 --> 00:45:19,342
So do you never strap in
or it's just on long road trips?

546
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:22,313
It's just, you know,
there's zombies everywhere.

547
00:45:22,518 --> 00:45:24,110
I think the least of my worries

548
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,311
Yeah, that's true. is seat belts.

549
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:27,648
Yes, but, no, she's not.

550
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:30,657
She's only famous when she's Hannah
Montana, when she's wearing the wig.

551
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,822
Okay. Right. Only wig. So...

552
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:39,860
It's kind of freeing.

553
00:45:40,103 --> 00:45:41,969
Yeah.

554
00:45:43,706 --> 00:45:47,871
<i>For the first time in a long time,
we were having fun.</i>

555
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:50,443
<i>So even though it ran counter
to our strategies,</i>

556
00:45:50,646 --> 00:45:53,445
<i>we decided to stay together
as far as Pacific Playland.</i>

557
00:46:22,512 --> 00:46:24,572
You know, I think sleep deprivation
is, like, the number one

558
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:25,822
health problem in America.

559
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:28,246
Well, now I think it
might be number two.

560
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:30,715
Number two.

561
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:31,920
That's adorable.

562
00:46:32,155 --> 00:46:34,315
I'm just saying I think we
should find a place to crash.

563
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:35,349
Oh, I got an idea.

564
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:39,153
We're in Hollywood,
let's sleep in style.

565
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:45,896
Grab a map.

566
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:53,431
Come on.

567
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:55,440
Hurry! Hurry!

568
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,704
Good job.

569
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,447
Looks like anyone who's ever been
in a movie lives on this block.

570
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:10,090
What exactly you think we're
doing in the 90 210, Sally?

571
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:12,755
I kind of pictured Tom Cruise
living somewhere nicer.

572
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:16,956
B-lister compared to who
I got in mind, folks.

573
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:20,226
We're going to the
tippy-top of the A-list.

574
00:47:20,436 --> 00:47:22,233
- Who?
- You'll see.

575
00:47:28,911 --> 00:47:30,242
Hey. There's a big BM.

576
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:33,445
And it ain't Bob Marley.

577
00:47:40,289 --> 00:47:42,690
This place is incredible.

578
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:58,273
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to <i>la mançion de</i> Murray.

579
00:47:58,474 --> 00:48:01,932
Ah. Bill Murray. God, no way.

580
00:48:02,144 --> 00:48:05,603
This guy has a direct line
to my funny bone.

581
00:48:05,815 --> 00:48:07,646
Everything...
Wait. Who's Bill Murray?

582
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:09,512
Hey, I've never hit a kid before.

583
00:48:11,153 --> 00:48:13,621
All right? I mean,
that's like asking who Gandhi is.

584
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:16,018
Who's Gandhi?

585
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,454
She's 12.

586
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,532
No Twinkies. Shit, fuck!

587
00:48:23,766 --> 00:48:26,201
See? I told you we should've
gone to Russell Crowe's.

588
00:48:26,402 --> 00:48:28,996
No one listens to me.
Hello, inside voices. Okay?

589
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:30,833
At least until we know we're alone.

590
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:34,121
Tallahassee, Wichita, why don't you
take that way. Little Rock, come here.

591
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,509
Why do I get stuck with her?

592
00:48:39,849 --> 00:48:42,318
It doesn't seem to end.

593
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:50,682
Hey, come here. Whoa.

594
00:48:50,893 --> 00:48:53,556
He has his own movie theater?

595
00:48:57,233 --> 00:48:59,793
Okay, I'm gonna teach you
a little something about Bill Murray.

596
00:49:01,737 --> 00:49:04,365
A king slept right here.

597
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,704
Dibs on the bed.

598
00:49:10,246 --> 00:49:12,909
Too soft for me, anyway.

599
00:49:19,755 --> 00:49:22,884
Oh, this is so exciting. You're about
to learn who you gonna call.

600
00:49:23,092 --> 00:49:25,356
It's <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

601
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,447
This is pretty catchy.

602
00:49:46,248 --> 00:49:47,840
Come on.

603
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:50,382
Help me with the boots. Come on.

604
00:49:50,586 --> 00:49:52,019
Help me with the boots.

605
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:56,021
Okay. I'll get them myself.

606
00:50:15,911 --> 00:50:17,641
Shit.

607
00:50:23,085 --> 00:50:24,610
Bill Murray, you're a zombie?

608
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:33,085
Ah! Ah! Oh! I'm on fire! Ouch!

609
00:50:33,429 --> 00:50:35,489
You're not a zombie,
you're talking, and...

610
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,496
You're okay? The hell I am!

611
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:42,331
I'm sorry. I didn't know
that it was "you" you.

612
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,507
Are you...? What's with the get-up?

613
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,438
Oh, I do it to blend in. You know.

614
00:50:47,643 --> 00:50:49,635
Zombies don't mess with other zombies.

615
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:51,905
Buddy of mine, makeup guy,
showed me how to do this.

616
00:50:52,114 --> 00:50:55,447
Cornstarch. You know, some berries,
a little licorice for the ladies.

617
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:59,179
Suits my lifestyle, you know.
I like to get out and do stuff.

618
00:50:59,422 --> 00:51:03,358
Just played nine holes on the Riviera.
Just walked on. Nobody there.

619
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:07,791
Goddamn it, Bill fucking Murray!

620
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:10,159
I had to get that out.
I don't mean to gush.

621
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:14,360
This is so surreal. I mean,
you probably get this all the time.

622
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:17,266
Maybe not lately, but I'm...
I'm such a huge fan of yours.

623
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:18,771
I mean, I swear, you know,

624
00:51:18,974 --> 00:51:22,103
I've seen every one of your movies
a million times.

625
00:51:22,311 --> 00:51:27,146
I even love your dramatic roles
and just everything.

626
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:31,150
Six people left in the world,
one of them is Bill fucking Murray!

627
00:51:31,353 --> 00:51:34,983
I know that's not your middle name. I been
watching you since I was like... Si...

628
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:38,628
Since I could masturbate.
I mean, not that they're connected.

629
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:41,525
"A former greenskeeper about
to become the Masters champion."

630
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,797
Well, that's why we do it.

631
00:51:50,005 --> 00:51:51,996
I love you, Bill. I love you.

632
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,673
<i>I thank you.</i>

633
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:55,204
Thank you.

634
00:51:55,711 --> 00:51:57,976
You are staring at me.
It's a hairpiece.

635
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:01,672
I'm sorry. No, it was just that you
look remarkably like Eddie Van Halen.

636
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:03,715
I just saw Eddie Van Halen. Nuh-uh.

637
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:04,920
Really? Yeah.

638
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:06,088
Wow. Where?

639
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,722
At the Hollywood Bowl.
How was that?

640
00:52:07,923 --> 00:52:09,221
He's a zombie.

641
00:52:09,425 --> 00:52:11,393
Aw. That's a tough break.

642
00:52:11,594 --> 00:52:14,222
So, uh, how about
a little West Coast hospitality?

643
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:15,990
Can l... Wha...
Can I get you something?

644
00:52:16,014 --> 00:52:17,494
What would you...
What would you like?

645
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:30,773
- Smooth, isn't it? Mm-hm.

646
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:33,811
Oh, hurry. Hurry, he's on the ceiling.

647
00:52:35,217 --> 00:52:37,914
Come get him. Avoid the chandelier.
Light him up, Ray.

648
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:42,217
See you on the other side, Pete.
Oh, he's so disgusting.

649
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:45,257
Looks like Slimer.
Don't cross the streams!

650
00:52:45,461 --> 00:52:47,452
Ah! I don't wanna cross...
Oh, no, he's awful.

651
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,097
Don't cross the streams!

652
00:52:52,835 --> 00:52:56,067
<i>Thirty-five feet long, weighing
approximately 600 pounds.</i>

653
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:57,398
<i>That's a big Twinkie.</i>

654
00:52:58,074 --> 00:52:59,905
Your sister is, uh, single, right?

655
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,543
There's nothing long
distance or anything?

656
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:04,509
No. Oh, good, good.

657
00:53:05,548 --> 00:53:08,541
And if she had, like,
a type, you know,

658
00:53:08,751 --> 00:53:11,777
if you can have a type,
what would that be, you think?

659
00:53:11,987 --> 00:53:14,251
She kind of goes for, like, bad boys.

660
00:53:14,456 --> 00:53:15,650
Really? Yeah.

661
00:53:15,858 --> 00:53:17,416
That's cool.

662
00:53:17,626 --> 00:53:19,150
What?

663
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:25,795
So Columbus is the scared one?
Yeah. He's like a little bunny.

664
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:28,331
I'll get him.

665
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:31,971
Watch this.

666
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,577
No.

667
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:44,650
No, no, it's okay, it's okay.

668
00:53:44,853 --> 00:53:46,650
I got him.

669
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:54,121
Is that how you say hello
where you come from?

670
00:53:54,797 --> 00:53:56,128
Oh, my God.

671
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:59,199
Oh, my God, I can't believe
I shot Bill Murray.

672
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:05,074
Mr. Murray?
I'm just Bill, I think, now.

673
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:07,969
Bill? Yeah?

674
00:54:08,177 --> 00:54:11,340
I don't think we're gonna
be able to stitch this.

675
00:54:11,947 --> 00:54:15,144
Ahh. That's still tender.

676
00:54:15,351 --> 00:54:17,081
You think you might pull through?

677
00:54:20,623 --> 00:54:21,818
No.

678
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:25,016
If it means anything now,
I am so sorry.

679
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:27,128
It was just instinctive.

680
00:54:27,329 --> 00:54:29,025
It was my bad.

681
00:54:29,231 --> 00:54:32,463
I was never a very
good practical joker.

682
00:54:33,068 --> 00:54:34,661
So do you have any regrets?

683
00:54:37,773 --> 00:54:40,139
<i>Garfield,</i> maybe.

684
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:07,637
I'm sorry, he just gets me.

685
00:55:09,204 --> 00:55:11,036
- But it still is sad.
- Yeah.

686
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:16,271
Okay. Oh, shit.

687
00:55:17,713 --> 00:55:19,704
Okay. Okay.

688
00:55:20,382 --> 00:55:23,215
Okay. Shit. Okay.

689
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:37,257
Sorry. One second.
It's a double-barrel. Sorry.

690
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:38,956
Okay.

691
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:47,865
Three, two, one.

692
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,603
You guys want some Purell? Yes.

693
00:55:50,813 --> 00:55:51,871
Please. Yeah.

694
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:53,271
Around the world.

695
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:58,954
- Yes.
- Whoa.

696
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:02,449
Oh, free parking. Yeah.

697
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:05,092
Which, coincidentally,
is the best thing about Zombieland.

698
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:08,128
No, best thing about Z-land,
no Facebook status updates.

699
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:11,164
You know, "Rob Curtis
is gearing up for Friday."

700
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:15,463
Who cares?
The best thing is no more flushing.

701
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:19,005
Epic.
And the worst thing about Z-land?

702
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:21,766
You mean, other than the fact
that I shot Bill Murray?

703
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:24,105
That's easy. Losing Buck.

704
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:26,945
That's his puppy.

705
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:31,347
I'm gonna tell you, I never thought
I could love anything like Buck.

706
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:35,614
He was just... The day he was
born, I just lost my mind.

707
00:56:37,793 --> 00:56:38,793
Sorry.

708
00:56:40,496 --> 00:56:42,965
We were... We were two peas.

709
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:49,126
He had my personality,
my laugh, my appetite.

710
00:56:49,338 --> 00:56:50,431
<i>Laugh?</i>

711
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:54,302
<i>That's when it hit me. I felt ashamed
that it had taken me this long...</i>

712
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:56,445
<i>Me, with the best
cardio in the business.</i>

713
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:59,376
<i>To realize I wasn't the only
one running from something.</i>

714
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:10,018
Oh, there it is. There you go.

715
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:13,753
Oh, you like the syrup. Yes.

716
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:16,692
Okay.

717
00:57:23,672 --> 00:57:26,800
We made this wallet
together out of duct tape.

718
00:57:32,681 --> 00:57:33,909
<i>Take away a man's son,</i>

719
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,885
<i>you've truly given him
nothing left to lose.</i>

720
00:57:47,463 --> 00:57:51,161
I haven't cried like that since <i>Titanic.</i>

721
00:58:09,418 --> 00:58:11,045
Hi.

722
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:33,268
A hint.

723
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:41,342
Why don't you, uh, exhale slowly,
squeeze the trigger?

724
00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:16,311
Don't make me drink alone.

725
00:59:16,518 --> 00:59:18,248
Okay.

726
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:27,853
It's a 1997 Geor... Georges?

727
00:59:29,364 --> 00:59:33,324
I never took French.
Georges de Latour? I don't know.

728
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:36,766
Oh, it's a '97? Yeah.

729
00:59:36,972 --> 00:59:39,304
Was that a good year? Oh, my God.

730
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:40,998
It was great year.
Are you kidding me?

731
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:44,838
I saw my first R-rated movie that year.

732
00:59:45,047 --> 00:59:46,947
Yeah, <i>Anaconda.</i>
Ah. <i>Anaconda.</i>

733
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:52,048
Um... First tattoo, porpoise.

734
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,313
Really? Oh. Fake.

735
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:56,648
First kiss.

736
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:58,619
Scotty Lynch.

737
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,923
You guys used tongue?

738
01:00:04,666 --> 01:00:06,657
Maybe.

739
01:00:07,536 --> 01:00:09,061
You jealous of Scotty Lynch?

740
01:00:10,672 --> 01:00:13,164
Uh, yes, I am. Um...

741
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:17,835
Actually, I think I'm jealous
of your whole 1997. Uh...

742
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:21,813
Let's see. Mine, um, uh...

743
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:24,144
First orthodontist.

744
01:00:24,353 --> 01:00:27,414
The bastard gave me headgear.
Yeah. I got my first B.

745
01:00:27,623 --> 01:00:29,523
Oh, no.

746
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:32,217
Frightening as <i>Anaconda.</i> Um...

747
01:00:33,061 --> 01:00:36,394
In wood shop, which doesn't really
count as a class anyway.

748
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:39,032
No. Um...

749
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:41,795
Had my first, uh, school dance.
Oh, thank you.

750
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:45,963
It was a Sadie Hawkins,
so girls' choice, you know.

751
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:50,342
Ugh. What, and nobody picked you?

752
01:00:50,545 --> 01:00:52,844
It was girls' choice.

753
01:00:53,048 --> 01:00:55,449
Those bitches. I know.

754
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,518
No, I will not stand for this.
No. You know what?

755
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:01,655
On behalf of all the
eighth-grade girls,

756
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:05,021
I would like to make it up to you.

757
01:01:07,829 --> 01:01:08,922
Relax.

758
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:11,429
Scotty's old news.

759
01:01:46,702 --> 01:01:51,231
I don't even know your name,
but this is actually really nice.

760
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:55,844
You know, between you, me
and <i>What About Bob?,</i>

761
01:01:57,447 --> 01:01:59,175
you're actually kind of cute.

762
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:00,440
You think so?

763
01:02:01,684 --> 01:02:02,981
Yeah.

764
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:06,447
I mean, you got the guts of a guppy,

765
01:02:07,289 --> 01:02:09,416
but I could hit that.

766
01:02:12,994 --> 01:02:14,860
Really?

767
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,856
Or at least give you
the intentional walk to first.

768
01:02:29,244 --> 01:02:31,076
Hey, a little help moving the couch?

769
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,646
Oh. We're making a fort.

770
01:02:39,722 --> 01:02:41,713
Yeah.
Yeah, that's probably for the best.

771
01:02:41,923 --> 01:02:43,721
Right. Uh, because, um,

772
01:02:45,661 --> 01:02:47,288
I like you,

773
01:02:47,496 --> 01:02:50,056
Columbus, but, um...
But, uh, my sister and l,

774
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:53,530
are gonna do whatever it
takes to survive, so...

775
01:03:04,746 --> 01:03:07,409
<i>I was hoping Wichita was
just playing hard to get,</i>

776
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:10,083
<i>but I realized she had
more trust issues than I did,</i>

777
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:13,152
<i>when I woke up the next
day and she was leaving.</i>

778
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,885
You are like a giant
cock-blocking robot,

779
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:23,224
like, developed in a secret
fucking government lab.

780
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:25,166
Hey.

781
01:03:25,367 --> 01:03:28,030
- I can't believe I almost kissed him.
- What's our rule?

782
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:30,932
Trust no one, just you and me.
Just you and me.

783
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:33,936
Yeah. You and me.

784
01:03:47,556 --> 01:03:49,922
You have just survived
the zombie apocalypse,

785
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:52,094
and drove halfway
across the country.

786
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:53,762
Where are you gonna go?

787
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:57,454
I'm going to Pacific Playland.
Whoo! Ha-ha.

788
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:18,309
Open sesame.

789
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:30,791
<i>This is the problem with
getting attached to someone.</i>

790
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,594
<i>When they leave you,
you just feel lost.</i>

791
01:04:33,802 --> 01:04:35,929
<i>Having Tallahassee around
didn't comfort me,</i>

792
01:04:36,137 --> 01:04:37,764
<i>it just made me feel more alone.</i>

793
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:41,637
Hey. You weren't exactly
gonna score, anyway.

794
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:45,210
You know, you weren't storming
the trenches before I came along.

795
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:50,413
That's why I don't let people close.
You only get burned.

796
01:04:50,619 --> 01:04:51,643
You don't say.

797
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:55,255
Mexico.

798
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:57,516
You know what they call
Twinkies in Mexico?

799
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:03,858
That's where I'm headed, amigo.
Whatever.

800
01:05:59,054 --> 01:06:00,282
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

801
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:01,489
This is really fun.

802
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:02,851
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

803
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:29,313
Oh, no.

804
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:34,021
I'm going after Wichita.

805
01:06:34,222 --> 01:06:37,750
Look, you ever read that book
<i>She's Just Not That Into You?</i>

806
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,893
You can't make yourself too available.

807
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:42,724
I don't care, all right?
I wanna be with her.

808
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:45,327
Have fun in Mexico.

809
01:06:50,405 --> 01:06:52,067
Come on. Hurry.

810
01:06:56,311 --> 01:06:57,472
Get in.

811
01:07:06,621 --> 01:07:08,556
Come on, go.

812
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:11,420
Go, go.

813
01:07:24,472 --> 01:07:28,375
On the count of three.
One, two, three.

814
01:07:42,123 --> 01:07:45,820
Uhn. You okay? Come on.
Hurry, get up.

815
01:07:46,027 --> 01:07:47,188
Come on, let's go. Yeah.

816
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:54,898
There.

817
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:17,859
Um, uh... I'm not great
at farewells, so, uh,

818
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:20,686
that'll do, pig.

819
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:23,688
That's the worst goodbye
I've ever heard,

820
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:25,992
and you stole it from a movie.

821
01:08:29,204 --> 01:08:31,332
Tell the ladies I said hey.

822
01:08:31,539 --> 01:08:34,064
You know, their pictures were
in someone's wallet too.

823
01:08:59,734 --> 01:09:01,532
Hop in the car, Evel Knievel.

824
01:09:02,003 --> 01:09:05,872
Let's go ride the roller coaster.
Thanks.

825
01:09:15,917 --> 01:09:17,510
Go!

826
01:10:17,512 --> 01:10:18,979
Not as fun as I remember.

827
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:27,047
Shoot the control box.

828
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:00,817
Columbus? Tallahassee?

829
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:05,551
I think they might actually
require our assistance this time.

830
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:09,457
Buckle up.
Yeah. I'm way ahead of you.

831
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:13,701
Time to nut up or shut up.

832
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:19,663
Holy shit.

833
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:46,065
My mama always told me,
someday I'd be good at something.

834
01:11:46,268 --> 01:11:48,667
Who'd have guessed that
something would be zombie killing?

835
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:49,871
Probably nobody.

836
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:53,032
Look.

837
01:11:55,810 --> 01:11:58,439
We better start working on our apology.

838
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:15,556
Oh, no. No.

839
01:12:22,837 --> 01:12:23,862
Hey!

840
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:25,404
- Hey! Ohio!
- Over here!

841
01:12:25,606 --> 01:12:27,574
- Hey! Help!
- Help!

842
01:12:27,775 --> 01:12:30,210
- Oh, my God.
- Help!

843
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:31,810
Hey!

844
01:12:32,413 --> 01:12:33,881
Help!

845
01:12:34,082 --> 01:12:37,211
Hey, they're up there. They're okay.
What are you waiting for?

846
01:12:37,418 --> 01:12:38,443
That's your gal.

847
01:12:40,488 --> 01:12:41,682
- Over here!
- Help!

848
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:47,917
Come on!
Come get a piece of Tallahassee!

849
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:50,064
Anybody hungry?

850
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:54,895
Tallahassee's nice this time of year!
Come on!

851
01:12:55,104 --> 01:12:56,400
Come on, you ugly bastards!

852
01:13:15,556 --> 01:13:17,024
Holy shit.

853
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:20,585
Holy shit.

854
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:22,490
Hey!

855
01:13:48,055 --> 01:13:49,148
Motherfucker!

856
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:23,083
Shit. I'm out of shells.

857
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:27,987
Bingo.

858
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:51,746
Here we go.

859
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:25,032
Oh. Oh, shit.

860
01:17:26,307 --> 01:17:29,072
Wichita! Little Rock! Hurry!

861
01:17:32,213 --> 01:17:34,273
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

862
01:17:34,515 --> 01:17:36,574
<i>Look at this fucking clown.</i>

863
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:42,585
<i>Of course. It had to be a clown.</i>

864
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:44,690
Fuck.

865
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:49,519
<i>No, wait, it had to be a clown,
and it had to be Wichita</i>

866
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:51,561
<i>for me to finally understand</i>

867
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,961
<i>that some rules are
made to be broken.</i>

868
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,238
<i>Time to nut up or shut up.</i>

869
01:18:04,779 --> 01:18:06,645
<i>Fuck this clown.</i>

870
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:52,350
Thanks. Hey.

871
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:55,756
Get your gun. Here you go. Hi.

872
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:57,490
Okay.

873
01:19:06,507 --> 01:19:08,668
Krista.

874
01:19:42,042 --> 01:19:45,739
Okay. We should probably head out now.

875
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:52,550
Finally got to first base.

876
01:19:52,753 --> 01:19:55,984
Not bad for that scrawny little spit-fuck.

877
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:05,364
Where's Florida?

878
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:10,662
I have a little hunch.

879
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:16,198
Where are you, you spongy,
yellow, delicious bastards?

880
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:17,844
- Where are you?
- Yo.

881
01:20:19,881 --> 01:20:22,679
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

882
01:20:22,884 --> 01:20:24,851
False advertising.

883
01:20:28,489 --> 01:20:29,854
Jesus Christ.

884
01:20:31,592 --> 01:20:33,082
You want a Sno Ball or something?

885
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:02,551
Oh, God.

886
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:11,564
Words cannot express.

887
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:13,234
It's too soon.

888
01:21:13,435 --> 01:21:17,427
Do you think you could maybe just pick out
the buckshot and just kind of eat around it?

889
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:18,832
Okay, yeah.

890
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:22,907
No!

891
01:21:23,110 --> 01:21:25,511
No! No!

892
01:21:28,315 --> 01:21:29,475
<i>That face?</i>

893
01:21:29,684 --> 01:21:32,983
<i>That's me realizing that those smart
girls in that big black truck</i>

894
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:37,118
<i>and that big guy in
that snakeskin jacket,</i>

895
01:21:37,524 --> 01:21:40,015
<i>they were the closest to
something I'd always wanted</i>

896
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:41,489
<i>but never really had.</i>

897
01:21:42,162 --> 01:21:43,630
<i>A family.</i>

898
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:46,493
<i>I trusted them and they trusted me.</i>

899
01:21:50,204 --> 01:21:52,502
<i>Enjoy the little things.</i>

900
01:21:53,908 --> 01:21:55,706
<i>Tallahassee got his Twinkie.</i>

901
01:21:55,911 --> 01:22:00,041
<i>And even though life would never
be simple or innocent again,</i>

902
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:03,376
<i>as he savored that spongy,
yellow log of cream,</i>

903
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:05,814
<i>we had hope. We had each other.</i>

904
01:22:07,655 --> 01:22:12,184
<i>And without other people, well,
you might as well be a zombie.</i>

905
01:22:12,426 --> 01:22:14,189
Thank you so much.
You had us going.

906
01:22:14,395 --> 01:22:15,521
Yeah.

907
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:19,791
That was very funny.

908
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:24,639
<i>Cardio, seat belts, and this has
nothing to do with anything,</i>

909
01:22:24,838 --> 01:22:26,670
<i>but a little sunscreen
never hurt anybody.</i>

910
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:33,976
<i>I'm Columbus, Ohio, from
Zombieland, saying good night.</i>

In the words of the immortal

In the... In the immortal...
How do you do it?

914
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:12,655
Just give me a little hint.

In the words of, the immortal,
philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre,
