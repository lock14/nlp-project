1
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,800
Does it have to be that tight?

2
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,600
Well, we have to be absolutely
sure you can't see.

3
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,800
Don't we?
Now don't be nervous.

4
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,000
I'll... I'll try not to be.

5
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,700
All right, here we go.

6
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,300
Okay, next.

7
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,500
This is difficult.

8
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,900
- Can I try the first one again?
- No problem.

9
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,400
Here you are.

10
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,500
This one.
Yes, this one.

11
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,900
Now are you sure?
You don't want to try any of the others?

12
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,200
No, I'm sure.
This is the best.

13
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,400
Okay, why don't you take your blindfold
off and see which one you chose?

14
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,800
I can't believe it.

15
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,900
We tested 100 people,

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,900
22 of which chose the instant coffee
just like Marsha here.

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,300
Another 29 people
chose the canned coffee.

18
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,300
That's a total of 51% who chose
the instant or canned coffee

19
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,900
over the $3-a-cup gourmet brand.

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,600
So the next time
you reach for your wallet,

21
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,200
are you really paying
for a superior blend,

22
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,100
or just a very fancy name?

23
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,300
This is CJ Nicholas for the News 8
Shreveport investigative team.

24
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,400
Hey, thanks, guys.

25
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,900
- I really appreciate it.
- That was hard hitting.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,400
- I have chills.
- I hear the networks calling you.

27
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Could you give me some cutaways?

28
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,000
And I'd really appreciate it
if you'd both bite me.

29
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
There really isn't much more to say.

30
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,000
Lucinda Harris was 22 years old.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,400
She's never gonna have a career.

32
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,800
- Did I miss it?
- Almost.

33
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,200
She's never gonna have a marriage.

34
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,700
She's never gonna be able
to have her own baby,

35
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,000
hold it in her arms.

36
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,900
And her parents there are never
gonna be able to kiss her again,

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,400
watch how her life unfolds.
It's over.

38
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,100
It's done.

39
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,000
And do you know why?

40
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,100
Because this man sitting right here,

41
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,900
Andre Benson, felt that she didn't
give him her purse fast enough.

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,800
Oh, she gave it to him, all right.

43
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,000
Just not fast enough for Mr. Benson.

44
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,400
So he shot her.

45
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,600
He shot her three times.

46
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,900
Only once, she might
have been wounded.

47
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,300
Two times,

48
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,700
there would have been
a spark of life left in her.

49
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,000
So he made sure.
He made triple sure.

50
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,100
Now the defense would like to tell you
that our whole case is circumstantial.

51
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,900
There is no eyewitness,
no ballistic match,

52
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,100
no alibi.

53
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,300
Andre Benson was home
in his apartment alone

54
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,800
watching TV.
Probably "Jeopardy. "

55
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,600
The defense can also explain

56
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,900
why Mr. Benson ran
from the scene of the crime

57
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,500
when the police came
to his back door.

58
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,900
He's a young black man
in a high crime area.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,100
Naturally you hear a loud bang
on your door, you get scared.

60
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,400
But do you know what?

61
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,300
We made sure too.

62
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,000
We made triple sure.

63
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,100
There's one thing he can't explain.

64
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,700
This cigarette butt

65
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,700
with Andre Benson's DNA
all over it

66
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,300
was found at the scene
of the crime

67
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,000
lying right next
to the deceased.

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,700
Now you have heard

69
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,800
the expert testimony
of the crime lab.

70
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,400
The odds of this not being

71
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,400
Andre Benson's DNA

72
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,000
is 6 billion to one.

73
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,600
That's right, 6 billion,

74
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,400
with a B,

75
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,400
to one.

76
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,200
Hunter dribbles behind
the three-point line.

77
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,100
Here comes the shot.

78
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,500
Now if you're willing to take that bet,

79
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,600
then I don't want to be
your district attorney.

80
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,500
- I want to be your bookie.
- Swish.

81
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,000
With this latest victory, you have
never lost a murder case.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,100
Are you going to announce
your candidacy for governor?

83
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,800
- The latest polls have you ahead.
- One at a time, please.

84
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,000
- Are you running for governor?
- It's Paul, right?

85
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,500
Paul, let me tell you something.
A beautiful young woman's life

86
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,800
was taken away in a moment
of incomprehensible violence.

87
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,200
That's what today is about.

88
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,800
Now why do moments like this
keep happening on our streets?

89
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,000
Those are the things
we have to ask ourselves.

90
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,600
Tonight when we all go home,
we have our nice dinners,

91
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,900
we have to ask
what would make a man

92
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,100
take an innocent human life

93
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,200
and treat it with such little respect?

94
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,800
Just snuff it out
like a match in the wind?

95
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,200
Now my only hope
out of this whole ordeal

96
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,900
is that Mr. and Mrs. Harris
will bring some closure to their life.

97
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,200
Today is not about keeping score.

98
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,400
It's not about politics.

99
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,000
Today was a real tragedy.
Thank you.

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Could he be smoother?

101
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,900
I got a chubby just watching.

102
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,800
Listen, I'll meet you
back at the station, okay?

103
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,700
Hey, dude, I keep on telling you.
She's out of your league.

104
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,700
And I'm gonna keep on trying.

105
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,900
Thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow.

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,400
Hey. Hi.

107
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,100
CJ, you've been
at the trial a lot.

108
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,900
- You noticed me.
- I noticed you staring at me.

109
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,300
That means you were looking at me.

110
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
I was looking at you staring.

111
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,000
- You're staring again.
- No, this is my look.

112
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,600
- I'm not staring.
- Hmm.

113
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,600
- I came to beg a favor.
- Again?

114
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,000
We're doing a companion piece
on police interrogation techniques

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,300
and I was wondering whether you'd
give me the police interview tape.

116
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,300
Now why would I do that?

117
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,100
'Cause then you get to
go out to dinner with me.

118
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,700
I can't go out to dinner with you.

119
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,600
It's not meal specific.
Could be lunch, perhaps a beverage.

120
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,900
- CJ, I can't.
- Why not?

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
- You're a reporter.
- And you work for the district attorney.

122
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,100
- I don't hold that against you.
- You don't like Mark Hunter?

123
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,600
- Not much.
- Why?

124
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,600
Or why not?
Whichever is correct.

125
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,700
A lot of reasons.
Too many to mention here.

126
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,200
- Why is correct.
- Give me one.

127
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,300
Too smooth.
Way too smooth.

128
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,300
And I'm not sure he's honest.

129
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,000
You say these things about my boss and
you expect me to have dinner with you?

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,800
I don't expect.
I hope.

131
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,600
And I don't want to go out to dinner with
him, I want to go out to dinner with you.

132
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,100
Besides, there's gonna be so many things
that we disagree on over the years...

133
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,900
favorite colors, small dogs...
I hate the little yappers...

134
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,600
electric or manual toothbrush...

135
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,500
countless things we're gonna
have to work through.

136
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,300
I promise I won't look or stare.

137
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,800
You'd really be helping me out
if you could get me that tape.

138
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,700
What harm could it do?

139
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,400
- The trial's over.
- I'll send it to your office.

140
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,100
- In person would be much...
- I'll send it to your office.

141
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,100
- better.

142
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,700
- Chinese.
- What?

143
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,900
I like Chinese food.

144
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,400
Chinese.
Definitely Chinese.

145
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,900
But just dinner. You're not gonna
get me into bed on the first date.

146
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,300
- What was I thinking?
- I have principles.

147
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,800
Hey hey, that same lady who keeps
calling and won't leave her name,

148
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,700
she called twice today.
You're a very bad boy, CJ.

149
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,900
You're my hero.
Oh, I don't know about...

150
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,200
- Uh, excuse me. You can't go in.
- Don't worry about it. He's expecting us.

151
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,100
- You look great, by the way.
- Sir?

152
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,300
- Thank you, Val.
- I got it.

153
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,200
- This is the big one.
- Sit your ass down.

154
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,200
District Attorney
Mark Hunter is faking

155
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,800
forensic evidence to get
convictions in murder trials.

156
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,500
He's not sitting his ass down.

157
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,300
I am though.
Ass is right down.

158
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,600
Snug.
This is his idea.

159
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,300
- I've got proof.
- Sit your ass down.

160
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,200
Hear me out.
Three years ago

161
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,100
Hunter lost a string of cases.

162
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,700
Now that's not something
a district attorney is supposed to do.

163
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,200
And then badda-bing...
17 murder convictions in a row.

164
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,900
Now he's leading the polls
for governor.

165
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,500
You think maybe he's on a lucky streak?

166
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,100
DAs don't try cases
they don't expect to win.

167
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,600
Okay, take a look at this.

168
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,300
Oh my God.

169
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,200
It's the crime scene photo
from the Andre Benson case.

170
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,700
Why am I listening to you?

171
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,000
There was no footprint match,
no fiber match,

172
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,200
no trace that Andre Benson
was even there,

173
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,900
except for this cigarette butt.

174
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,100
So Andre Benson had the presence
of mind to pick up his shell casings

175
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,300
but not his cigarette butt
that he left right next to the victim's hand?

176
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,300
I think you used the word proof?

177
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,000
The interview tape.

178
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,500
Just bear with me here.

179
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,600
The detective on the left,
one Anthony Merchant.

180
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,500
Now before Hunter joined the DA's
office, he was a police detective

181
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,500
and his partner for many
of those years was none other

182
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,000
than Detective Lieutenant
Anthony Merchant.

183
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,400
Now watch.

184
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,900
Okay, here we go.

185
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,100
That's how they got the cigarette
butt with Benson's DNA.

186
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,600
- It's right there in front of us.
- This is your proof?

187
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,500
You going along with this?

188
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,800
All of these 17 convictions
were decided by DNA evidence.

189
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,200
In each case the lead detective was
none other than Anthony Merchant.

190
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
How did you get that tape?

191
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,000
From a source.

192
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,700
And I bet this source has a skirt.

193
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,500
Does it matter?

194
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,100
- Not really.
- Then what is it?

195
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,700
I mean, this is a story...
a monster story.

196
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,300
I just received the new budget.

197
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,500
We can't afford the investigation
team anymore.

198
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,800
- What?
- You've got to be kidding me.

199
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,800
- Come on.
- Have you looked at your ratings?

200
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,600
- No.
- Well, it's not a pretty sight.

201
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,900
It just so happens that the folks
who own this place

202
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,700
have this funny little obsession
about ratings.

203
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,200
It seems that ratings pay the rent.
No ratings, no rent.

204
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,800
So you guys are both
going on general assignment.

205
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,400
- Oh, come on.
- I don't like this any more than you do.

206
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,400
Hey, I saw your documentary.
That's why I hired you. I know you're good.

207
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,800
- What about this story?
- What story?

208
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,200
You've got some stones coming
in here using the word proof.

209
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,900
You answer me one simple question:

210
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,800
How in the hell could Detective Merchant
plant that cigarette at the crime scene

211
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,300
when the interview took place
three days after

212
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,900
the crime scene photographs
were taken?

213
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,200
Well...

214
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,100
Pick up your assignments
at the front desk and get out of here.

215
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,700
I would just like to say
that is an excellent tie.

216
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,200
Out!

217
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,600
I've been assigned to our fearless
sportscaster and his lovely toupee.

218
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,300
You're doing a piece on people
over 65 who run the 10k.

219
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,700
Hunter's dirty.
I can feel it in my bones.

220
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,200
And I'm gonna prove it.

221
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,800
I've worked too hard to go back
to baby rhinos at the zoo.

222
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
There's baby rhinos at the zoo?

223
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,400
What? No, it's a metaphor.

224
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
- You know, baby rhinos, kitten in a tree.
- Right.

225
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
- So there's no baby rhinos?
- Would you shut up?

226
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,100
Hey, CJ, that woman
is on the line again.

227
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,700
Yeah, okay.
I'll take it.

228
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,300
- Yeah, line 7.
- Thanks.

229
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,300
- Do you mind?
- No, not at all. Go ahead.

230
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,800
- Get the hell out of here.
- Call me if you need me.

231
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,200
Hello?

232
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,000
Yeah.

233
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,100
Listen, now's...
this isn't really a good time.

234
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,000
Yes.

235
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,300
No, I'm not.

236
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,600
Things aren't going
very well for me right now.

237
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,700
I understand.

238
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,500
Okay.

239
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,700
I will.

240
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,400
I promise.

241
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,900
Thank you.

242
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,000
You should have seen
that 10k.

243
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,400
There should be an age limit
for wearing spandex.

244
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,800
Sorry I missed it.

245
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,100
I didn't come out here
to do stories like that.

246
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,900
Who does?

247
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,300
Right.

248
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,400
You're not staring at me.

249
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,800
You told me I wasn't allowed to.

250
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,400
I didn't think you'd actually listen.

251
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,900
I'm feeling too sorry for myself
to do any good staring.

252
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,300
- That's a damn shame.
- I could try.

253
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,900
Give it your best shot.

254
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,500
That's not too bad.

255
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,800
I could do much better.

256
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,300
This is my B stare.

257
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,500
If I ever give you my full stare...

258
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,400
Shut up.

259
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,100
Keep staring.

260
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,300
I felt so sorry for you.

261
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,800
You looked so sad
at the table.

262
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,900
Ah yes, the whole
end-of-my-career thing.

263
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I was making that up.

264
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,800
It's not the end of your career.

265
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,800
- It's not exactly a promotion.
- Yeah, but it's not the end.

266
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,500
All you have to do
is something really good.

267
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,300
Really good,
and they'll have to put it on.

268
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,600
Well, I...

269
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,500
think I might have something.

270
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,900
Might have.

271
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
- Maybe.
- Well, what is it?

272
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,300
Not now.

273
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,300
I just can't tell you now.

274
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't even have it yet.

275
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,300
And it's privileged.

276
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,600
Everything I said
when I took my clothes off,

277
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,500
that's privileged.

278
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,100
Morning.

279
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,500
Good morning is right.

280
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,400
Coffee?

281
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,300
Thank you.

282
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,400
What's in your kitchen?

283
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,200
A stove, a refrigerator
that makes ice cubes.

284
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,800
What about eggs?

285
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,100
Yes, eggs.
I can do eggs.

286
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,100
- And maybe even some toast?
- Mmm.

287
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,300
Holy shit.

288
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,600
You won an award.

289
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,600
Yeah, that's what brought me out here.

290
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,000
I was working for a little station
in Buffalo, New York.

291
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,900
You know, Mark Twain once said that to
commit suicide in Buffalo was redundant.

292
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,100
I did this piece
on a girl, Taieesha,

293
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,000
15-year-old kid, got pregnant
by her stepfather

294
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,800
and her mother kicked her
out of the house.

295
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,000
She had no home,
no place to go

296
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,800
in the middle
of December in Buffalo.

297
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,400
You can't even begin to imagine
what winters are like there.

298
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,500
Found her living on the streets
hooking to make money.

299
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,800
It's nice to know people will pay
to have sex with a pregnant teenager.

300
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,300
She was in a snowstorm
when she went into labor.

301
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,000
I'd like to see it.

302
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,700
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

303
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,900
Okay.

304
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,100
She was so little.

305
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,300
She wouldn't let me show her face.

306
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,000
Felt like she could break
if you held her wrong.

307
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,400
I cleaned her off as best I could.

308
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
I knew I had to keep her warm.

309
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,000
I wrapped her underneath my coat.

310
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,400
I could feel her against my breast.

311
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,100
After a while I felt her grow,

312
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,500
you know, cold

313
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,000
up against my skin.

314
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,900
I knew the church,

315
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,900
they'd take care of her.

316
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,300
They'd bury my baby girl.

317
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,700
When I started to walk away

318
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,200
I just couldn't see her wrapped
in all those newspapers

319
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,800
in front of the church.
I couldn't.

320
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,900
I knew she was with God.

321
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,700
Still...

322
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,400
I couldn't look back.

323
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,600
Jane Doe's mother had a...

324
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,400
Wow.

325
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,600
I, uh, don't really know
what to say.

326
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,900
It's... I'd like to see the rest.

327
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,500
Go ahead, take it.

328
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,100
I've got a bunch of copies.

329
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,900
- She, uh...
- What happened to her?

330
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,700
She died of an overdose
two weeks after the interview.

331
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,400
She never got to see the piece
or the attention it got.

332
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,500
So they brought me out here.

333
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,700
It's not much bigger,

334
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,200
but at least I got my own
investigative unit.

335
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,800
And now that's gone.

336
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,500
CJ, you really are
a good reporter.

337
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,700
Hey, no no.

338
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,900
You said you had an idea.
Well, go, follow it.

339
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,100
Look, I told you
this is not a good time.

340
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,000
All right, I will.
Just stay calm.

341
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,600
You dropped your pens.

342
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,200
Later.

343
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,300
Four, four, good.
I'm not close.

344
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,400
Stay on that way.
Focus here.

345
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,500
No seven.
I need you. I need you.

346
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,000
- Come on.
- Come on, I was on a roll.

347
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,500
- Yeah, I noticed.
- What's happening?

348
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,600
How far would you go
for the story of your lifetime?

349
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,400
I mean, you know me,
farther than far.

350
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,900
Would you risk everything?

351
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,600
Depends on what you mean
by everything.

352
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,700
Everything means everything,
including going to prison.

353
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,000
- You're kidding.
- Never been more serious in my entire life.

354
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,300
Jesus. I mean, I don't know.

355
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm talking about the biggest story
we've ever dreamed of.

356
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,500
I'm talking about the Pulitzer Prize.

357
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,400
- You're also talking about prison.
- Just hear me out.

358
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,200
When I'm done, you say no
we don't do it. It's your choice.

359
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,200
Of course it will mean you'll spend
the rest of your numbered days

360
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,400
producing ticky tidbits
from a minor league infield.

361
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,000
And it'll also mean
you have no scrotal sack.

362
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,900
We gonna cut to commercial
before we do Final Jeopardy?

363
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,300
Right, cut to the chase.

364
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,200
We both know that Hunter is bringing
in fake DNA to get those convictions.

365
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,800
- Right.
- We don't know exactly how,

366
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,800
- but we know that he's doing it.
- Mm-hmm.

367
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,500
- You with me?
- So far, yeah.

368
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,800
Well, there's one way
we can prove it.

369
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,100
- And is this the risky part?
- Not yet.

370
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,300
First we have to wait
for the right murder.

371
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,800
What do you...
the right murder?

372
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,700
The murder of some
anonymous person, okay?

373
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,500
Some junkie or hooker

374
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,500
where the cops have no suspect
and they really don't give a shit.

375
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,700
And there's got to be some
vague physical evidence

376
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,600
like a tire track
or a footprint.

377
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,100
Not a lot.

378
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,100
And it's got to happen
when I have no alibi.

379
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,000
Who needs an ali...
why can't you have one?

380
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,400
I can't have an alibi 'cause that's when
we plant the circumstantial evidence.

381
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,800
We what?

382
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,100
We plant enough circumstantial
evidence that it points to me.

383
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,300
- You're shitting me.
- I shit you not.

384
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,600
We not only plant it,
you document us planting it.

385
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,300
You tape me doing it,

386
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,300
each time with the day's
newspaper in the shot.

387
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,800
That way we can prove that
the evidence came after the fact.

388
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,500
Aren't there laws
against this kind of thing?

389
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,100
More than one.
Anyway, enough circumstantial evidence

390
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,600
and District Attorney Mark S Hunter
won't be able to resist.

391
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,100
He'll arrest me, he'll indict me
and he'll put me on trial.

392
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,400
And not only will he
have a high profile case,

393
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,800
he will have a truly sexy, juicy,

394
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,500
front page lead story

395
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,700
that'll tie up the nomination
for governor.

396
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,600
And he'll have a white defendant
that he won't be able to resist.

397
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,000
Is there a change of seasons
on your planet?

398
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,500
Because he could never ever
ever afford to lose this case.

399
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,900
And he'll only have
circumstantial evidence.

400
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,400
Some trace of my DNA
will suddenly be found,

401
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,200
just like it was in all the other cases.

402
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,500
Only this time after he introduces it,

403
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,000
you get the video
and we show it in court.

404
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,800
You think there's a chance a judge

405
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,600
won't have much of a sense of humor
about this?

406
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,300
A judge will go stark raving apeshit.

407
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,300
The pandemonium this'll create

408
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,900
by graphically proving
that Hunter is crooked,

409
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,500
that'll overshadow everything.

410
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,400
Do you have any idea
how big of a story this will be?

411
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,300
Do you really think the DA's office

412
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,900
is gonna want to prosecute us
after this thing breaks?

413
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,300
Look, we know a wrong
is being committed

414
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,600
by a man that may become
our next governor.

415
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,500
We are investigative reporters.

416
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,500
This is our chance to prove it.

417
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,600
It's perfect.

418
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,900
I don't know, man.

419
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,800
Come on, this is our chance.

420
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,700
This could be our Pulitzer.

421
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,600
This is the diem
that we have to carpe.

422
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,200
This is the proverbial pot that we
have to shit or get off of.

423
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,100
This right here, right now,
this is it.

424
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,500
God help me.

425
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,400
I'm in.

426
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,600
No, God help Mark Hunter.

427
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,600
I don't know, Ella.

428
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,400
You're either awfully late
for your trial or really early.

429
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,200
You okay?

430
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,900
Uh, yeah, I'm okay.

431
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,500
It's just tomorrow
is my first day as lead so I'm trying to...

432
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,000
Thought maybe the best way to prepare
is sit here in the courtroom alone, huh?

433
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
That's what I did at my first trial.

434
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You know, worked for me.

435
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,000
You see that judge's bench,

436
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,500
that big old fancy seal, the flag,

437
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,800
the jury box and you go, "Whoa.

438
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,100
This is big.
This is really big stuff. "

439
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,000
And it is.

440
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,900
We put bad guys away.
That's what we do.

441
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,900
And if you're sure...

442
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,200
I mean down to your marrow sure...

443
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,200
that defendant is guilty,

444
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,200
that jury is going
to follow you anywhere.

445
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,100
But if you've got
even an inkling of a doubt,

446
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,000
you'll lose them like sand
right through your fingers.

447
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,200
It's amazing. They can smell doubt.
I don't know how they do it.

448
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,900
So I guess the most important
thing is to be sure.

449
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,200
- Are you?
- Yes.

450
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,300
- No doubts?
- No.

451
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,400
You make them feel that,

452
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,700
you're not gonna have any
problem at all.

453
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,400
That, you know, and maybe work
the room a little bit, okay?

454
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,000
Okay.

455
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,300
- Ella, good night.
- Good night.

456
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,600
- And good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

457
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,400
- CJ, wake up!
- Jesus Christ.

458
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,000
Ow! Shit!

459
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
- CJ!
- Coming. Take it easy.

460
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Is she here? I was hoping to
barge in on the two of you.

461
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,300
I'm dying to see her naked.

462
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,500
No, she's got a trial in the morning.

463
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,100
- What's going on?
- Why are you limping?

464
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,800
I came down on my ankle
funny when I got out of bed

465
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,500
because some asshole woke me
up at 4:00 in the morning.

466
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,800
What?
What is it?

467
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,100
Get dressed.

468
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,300
Gentlemen.

469
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,200
And I use that term loosely
with the fourth estate.

470
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,700
How'd you get here so fast?

471
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,100
We do have police scanners
in the newsroom, you know.

472
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,500
Really? Next thing you're gonna
tell me is you have a color TV.

473
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,900
- Who is she?
- Dead black junkie hooker.

474
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,500
Her purse was full of condoms.
Most of her customers must be white

475
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,900
'cause the condoms
are regular size.

476
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,100
Cute. Homicide?

477
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,500
Four stab wounds
to the chest and neck.

478
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,500
I'm gonna go way out
on a limb and say yes.

479
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,000
Got any leads?

480
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,200
Got a witness.
Fella over there saw the whole thing.

481
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,000
Or at least his dog did.
It bit the perp.

482
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,400
- Any physical evidence?
- Got a pretty good footprint.

483
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,400
What about the knife?
Did you find the knife?

484
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,000
Why are you so interested?

485
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,500
The victim doesn't have to be famous
for us to be interested.

486
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,100
Whatever you say.

487
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,500
- I'm gonna check him out.
- Yeah, all right.

488
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,500
Listen, think maybe I could take a look
at the crime scene report and photos?

489
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,400
- Now why the hell would I do that?
- I got two primo Springsteen tickets.

490
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,300
Springsteen?
Bruce Springsteen?

491
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,100
- No, his cousin Ralph.
- Do I look white to you?

492
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,600
What?

493
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,500
Do I look white to you?

494
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,200
Well, in certain angles.

495
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,000
Your Mr. Springsteen does not
do it for me. I am unmoved.

496
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,900
We're talking about The Boss here.

497
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,700
No, he's your Boss.
He ain't mine.

498
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,400
Did I mention backstage passes?

499
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,000
I mean, do you have any idea
what women will do

500
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,600
for backstage passes to Springsteen?

501
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,900
Take a good look at me.

502
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,200
This is exactly
what unmoved looks like.

503
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,200
I'll think of something.

504
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,200
You always do, my brother.

505
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,100
You always do.

506
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,600
Goody bag from Nickerson...
all the reports and crime scene photos.

507
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,600
I knew he couldn't pass up
Springsteen tickets.

508
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,300
All right, let's see
what we've got here.

509
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,800
Ooh, wow. Ha.

510
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,100
Shoeprint came in from some loopy
Italian sneaker called Montalvo.

511
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,200
They don't make it anymore.
Size 10-12. What are you?

512
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,700
11 and a half. He never went
for the Springsteen tickets.

513
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,100
They also found a can
of pepper spray at the scene.

514
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,000
Probably the victim's.
What did he go for?

515
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,500
The witness heard an argument
between a man and a woman.

516
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,900
He heard the man cry out in pain.
She probably sprayed him.

517
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,400
Then the woman screamed,
the dog took off,

518
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,900
bit the perp and the guy ran away.

519
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,800
- Got him Saint's tickets.
- Perfect. What kind of dog?

520
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,800
Jack Russell terrier.
45-yard line.

521
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,300
Jim Carrey, "The Mask"...
love that film.

522
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,700
45 yard line?
That's like my seats. What row?

523
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,100
The witness didn't see the perp but said
he was wearing a dark jogging suit.

524
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,100
Looked like Reebok because it had
two stripes down the side.

525
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,900
He was positive it had two stripes,

526
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,900
sneakers and a dark ski mask.

527
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,900
And he was holding a knife
with a dark handle.

528
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,000
Row 22.

529
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,500
Stab wounds are consistent
with a switchblade, around four inches.

530
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,000
That's the same row as...

531
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,700
Dude, tell me you didn't
give him my tickets.

532
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,600
- You're not telling me.
- It's for one season.

533
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,500
You said one reason, right?
Not one season.

534
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,200
What does it say about the victim?

535
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,500
You are beyond a prick.

536
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,800
I am a prick that is going to win
us a Pulitzer Prize, my friend.

537
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,600
- Now have they ID'd the victim yet?
- Doris Ruth Owens.

538
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,100
Shit.

539
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,300
She was just 22 years old.

540
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,600
Lots of arrests for solicitation,
some for drugs.

541
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,500
A coulpe here in Shreveport.
Nice.

542
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,200
Others in Virginia, Maryland,
New Jersey, New York.

543
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,600
One way to see America...
on your back.

544
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,400
22 years old.

545
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,200
So let's make our shopping list.

546
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,600
We really gonna do this?

547
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,100
You boys lost?

548
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,800
Crate & Barrel is about
four blocks that way.

549
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,900
Actually, we're...

550
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,800
we're looking for a switchblade,
about four inches.

551
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,600
Some bully picking on you during recess?
Taking your lunch money?

552
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,700
- It's got to have a white handle.
- Switchblades are illegal.

553
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,100
- I know that.
- You a cop?

554
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,200
- No.
- What about your sister over there?

555
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,600
Who, me? Cop? No.

556
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,700
Do I look like a cop?
You know?

557
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,100
- It's a prop.
- A what?

558
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,600
We're making an independent film.

559
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,600
One of the characters
has to use it in the scene.

560
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,000
350.

561
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,100
You've got to be joking.

562
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,100
Do I look like the type of man
that tells a joke?

563
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,100
No, you don't.

564
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,600
Come on.
I mean, it's way too much.

565
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,500
Well, why don't you try Walmart?
Maybe they'll have one.

566
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,500
Wait.

567
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,600
and throw in a can of pepper spray.

568
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,900
Sounds like a pretty violent
movie you two are making.

569
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,900
- Yeah.
- That's what sells.

570
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,900
Cash only.

571
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,200
You got 150?

572
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,100
How's it going?

573
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,000
All right.

574
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,300
- Can I get a receipt?
- No.

575
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,800
- Why not?
- 'Cause I never sold you that.

576
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,500
Can I ask you a personal question?

577
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,000
Go right ahead.

578
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,800
What happens with that nose ring
when you sneeze?

579
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,600
It gets snot on it.

580
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,200
Okay, let's...

581
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,900
Thanks a lot.

582
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,500
Thank you.

583
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,800
Are you looking for
a specific type of dog?

584
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,100
A Jack Russell terrier.

585
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,000
Like the kind in "Mask"
or "Frasier. "

586
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,000
I think I know what a Jack Russell is.
Thank you.

587
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,500
We have one
that's mostly Jack Russell.

588
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,200
He's out there.

589
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,000
He's not a purebred.
If you're looking for a pedigree,

590
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,100
this is not the right place for you.

591
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,400
- Is he the same size?
- Yes.

592
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,200
Could we see his teeth?

593
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,300
You can tell he's not too old.

594
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
These little fellas
can be a real handful.

595
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,200
You might want to think
about getting him fixed.

596
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,000
- He's completely housebroken.
- That makes one of you.

597
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,300
- We'll take him.
- That's a wonderful thing you're doing.

598
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,400
Would you mind holding this up?
For posterity.

599
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,600
I know what it's like.
My wife has to document every occasion

600
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,900
like it's a presidential inauguration.

601
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,100
Well, I hope he brings
lots of happiness

602
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,800
to you both.

603
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,400
- Thanks.
- Appreciate it.

604
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,300
- Come on.
- Here you go.

605
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,200
These doggy treats actually
smell kind of good.

606
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,000
I think I might try one.

607
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,000
- I'm gonna name him Woodward.
- Nice.

608
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,700
All right, Woodward.

609
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,700
That's it, get it.
Bite the pants.

610
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,700
Come on.
There you go, buddy. Bite it.

611
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,200
Yeah, get 'em.
All right, grab a beer.

612
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,200
- I'm gonna throw these things on.
- All right.

613
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,400
Ow! Not yet, you moron.

614
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,100
Finley, get in here.

615
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,500
- What happened?
- Look at this.

616
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,000
- God damn, this hurts.
- Damn! From that little dog?

617
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,600
- Shit.
- Give me the newspaper.

618
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,400
- Put it in the shot.
- All right.

619
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,600
Grab that.

620
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,900
Little bastard wouldn't even wait
for me to get everything ready.

621
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,400
- You got it?
- Got it.

622
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,900
Who the hell wears a Montalvo?

623
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,100
Never heard of it.

624
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,900
We searched every
retailer in Shreveport.

625
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,600
None of them have ever
carried a Montalvo.

626
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,300
They stopped making it in 1999.

627
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,700
That tells you how popular they were.

628
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,600
Maybe the guy is from Italy.

629
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,200
Right, this has all the earmarks
of a mafia hit.

630
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,700
What about a tourist, you know,
looking for some late-night action?

631
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,700
Maybe.

632
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,300
- I don't know.
- This smells like an evidence box

633
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,400
stored next to all those other evidence
boxes of unsolved homicides.

634
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,900
I hate that smell.

635
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,700
I really do.

636
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,800
All right, let's do this.

637
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,200
Okay.

638
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,300
Yeah, there you go.

639
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,600
Okay.

640
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,000
- Got that?
- Yup. Sure you want to do this?

641
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,600
I'm sure I don't want to do it.
It's just the pattern may be different

642
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,900
- if we just sprayed the mask.
- Okay.

643
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,200
Think Katie Couric would do this
for a story?

644
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,900
She had a colonoscopy on national
television for God's sake.

645
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,400
Huh.
Okay, here goes.

646
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,000
God! Shit!

647
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,500
Oh shit. Put your head up.
Grab the newspaper.

648
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,800
- I can't see.
- Grab it. It's right...

649
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,500
Oh God, I'm tasting it.

650
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,800
- Christ, that burns.
- Just hold it up.

651
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,100
You're all heart, you know that?
You got it?

652
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,200
- Yeah, I got it.
- Okay, the water. Give me the water.

653
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,000
Tomorrow night's the night.

654
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,100
We could go to jail for this,
couldn't we?

655
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,600
- It's possible.
- Just checking.

656
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,400
All right, I'm gonna make
a backup disc

657
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,000
and I'm gonna keep the original
locked in my desk.

658
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,500
You can back out now
if you really want to.

659
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,700
Just give me the tape
and the backup DVD

660
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,500
and I'll never reveal
you were behind the camera.

661
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,100
What if they threaten you with jail?

662
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,900
I'll already be in jail,
so what the hell's the difference?

663
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,300
Okay, what if they go all Guantanamo
on you and start doing torture shit?

664
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,200
- Then I'd definitely crack.
- Exactly.

665
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,600
But I couldn't bear the thought of you
winning the Pulitzer all by yourself.

666
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,000
Just remember, we can't breathe
a word of this to anyone.

667
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,500
Not even my own lawyer can know.
Nothing, or he'll be disbarred.

668
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,200
- All right.
- Nobody can know.

669
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,900
Absolutely nobody.
No exceptions.

670
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,500
What about the lady with the fantastic
tits that works at that bar on Piedmont?

671
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,000
- Okay, just her.
- And what about the one with the tattoo?

672
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,600
Shut up.

673
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,500
- I'm just as scared as you are.
- No you're not.

674
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,100
This way.
Come on.

675
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,200
- You lied to me.
- What?

676
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,400
- You said you hated small dogs.
- Oh.

677
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,000
- Hey.
- Hi.

678
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,900
I was at the animal shelter
doing a story.

679
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,100
He was pretty hard to resist.
He promised he wouldn't yap.

680
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,300
- Hello. What's your name?
- You're asking him?

681
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,900
Probably gonna have
a bit of a wait there.

682
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:38,300
- It's Woodward.
- Hello, Woody.

683
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,000
Your eyes are red.
Have you been crying?

684
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,400
Just allergies from the dog.

685
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,500
- Hello. Oh.
- Would you stop that?

686
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,900
- Oh my.
- I would like to kiss you, you know.

687
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,900
- What's stopping you?
- He is. It'd be like kissing him.

688
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,700
No, there's a difference.
Try it.

689
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,900
Come on.
Don't be a chicken.

690
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,500
Ugh!

691
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,900
See? Now me.

692
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,900
Mmm.

693
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,700
No thanks. I prefer sugar
with my coffee, not salt.

694
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,800
Oh, sorry.

695
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,200
It's understandable,
they're both white.

696
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,300
- Where are you?
- What?

697
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,900
Where are you?

698
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,500
I'm, uh...
I'm just a little distracted.

699
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,500
It's nothing.
I'm sorry.

700
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,700
It's because I said the L word
last night, isn't it?

701
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,900
- You said you're a lesbian?
- Don't bullshit me now.

702
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,200
I'm sorry.

703
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,700
I was an idiot.
I didn't mean to pressure you.

704
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,800
I just got kind of carried away
in the heat of passion.

705
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,100
No. No, that's not it.

706
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,700
I was glad you said it.
I was thrilled.

707
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,700
Actually, I feel the same way.

708
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,600
Was it just the heat of passion
that made you say it?

709
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,600
No. You do?

710
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,400
What? I'm confused now.

711
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,300
No, it wasn't the heat
of passion that made me say it.

712
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,800
You do feel the same way?

713
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,200
You know I do.

714
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,400
- I...
- You don't have to say it.

715
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,600
No, I think I do.
I love you.

716
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,700
Listen to me.
Listen to me very carefully.

717
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,900
- You might hear some things.
- What kind of things?

718
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,300
Things...
not necessarily good things.

719
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,100
- What are you talking about?
- I'm asking you to trust me.

720
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,400
Are you married?

721
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,900
No.

722
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,900
Do you have a brood of illegitimate
children in ports around the world?

723
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,400
- Not a one.
- Do you have a disease

724
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,400
where body parts I like
are gonna start falling off?

725
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,700
- No.
- Then we'll be fine.

726
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,600
Come on.

727
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,400
Here we go.

728
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,300
Oh, man.

729
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,800
I had to see this for myself.

730
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,400
Well, my brother,
you really have done it.

731
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,800
Go ahead, have your fun.
Give it your best shot.

732
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,700
You couldn't take my intermediate
much less my best shot.

733
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,300
So I will remember this sight as one
of those Kodak moments,

734
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,300
which unfortunately was all too brief.

735
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,000
Good news is you made bail.

736
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,400
Your friend Finley
is on his way upstairs.

737
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,600
Last name Nicholas,
first name Christopher,

738
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,300
middle name John;
Driving while shitfaced.

739
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,600
Sign here.

740
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,100
The lesser good news is
your brethren in the press

741
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,400
are gathered outside with
their lights and their cameras

742
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,800
and their need for blood.

743
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,700
They are a hungry bunch.

744
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,600
I arranged for your friend to park
in the department garage

745
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,100
which would allow you
to avoid your colleagues

746
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,300
and sneak out the back.

747
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,400
I owe you.
I really do.

748
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,400
I'll think of something.

749
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,100
I'm sure you will.

750
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,200
Hey, guys.

751
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,000
- You ready?
- Yup.

752
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,000
Thanks again.

753
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,700
No problem.
No problem at all.

754
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,300
No problem at all.

755
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,900
Ella.

756
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,700
Something happened tonight.

757
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,600
No no no, no accident.
I'm fine.

758
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,600
I am, really.

759
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,900
It's just I sort of got arrested...

760
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,500
more like actually arrested

761
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,500
for DUl.

762
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,000
No, don't come over,
I feel shitty enough as it is.

763
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,600
Wait a minute.
Someone's at the door.

764
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,500
Yeah, hold on.
I'm coming.

765
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,900
Ella, I'm gonna have to call you back.
Remember what I said the other morning?

766
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,500
You know, the I-love-you thing.

767
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,600
Well, it's still happening.

768
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,800
I love you.

769
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,900
Shreveport Police Department.
Open up now.

770
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,400
All right, I'm coming.
Just give me a second, for Christ's sake.

771
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,200
Open the door
or we will break it down.

772
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,800
This is a warrant to search your home.

773
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,300
I need you to read it
and then sign it.

774
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,700
Lift your trouser leg, please.

775
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,500
You mind telling me
what this is all about?

776
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,800
The pant leg, CJ.

777
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,000
Let's try the other leg.

778
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,600
Well well,
what do we have here?

779
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,900
- It's nothing.
- No, it most definitely is something.

780
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,400
Lift the bandage and let me see.

781
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,300
- And how'd you get that?
- It's from him.

782
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,200
Hey, Lieutenant.

783
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,300
- Turn around, please.
- What?

784
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,400
Turn around now.

785
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,600
CJ Nicholas, you are under arrest

786
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,700
for the murder
of Doris Ruth Owens.

787
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,500
- Are you crazy?
- Anything you say

788
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,100
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

789
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,000
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford one...

790
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,400
I'm sure Mr. Nicholas understands
his Miranda rights.

791
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,200
- Isn't that right, Mr. Nicholas?
- I understand my rights.

792
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,700
What I don't understand is why
I'm being arrested for murder.

793
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,200
Thank you very much, Detective Nickerson.
I'll take it from here.

794
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,600
- What?
- I said I'll take it from here.

795
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,800
- Are you taking my collar?
- He remains your collar.

796
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,600
No one is taking anything
away from you.

797
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,500
You'll get all the credit for your work.

798
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,800
I'm taking over the investigation
by request of the DA.

799
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,100
I don't get this.
But I also realize when it ain't mine to get.

800
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,900
The best seats to any event
ain't gonna get you out of this.

801
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,400
I called you every day.

802
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,200
I know you have.

803
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,100
I don't understand.
Why haven't you called me back?

804
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,000
- You shouldn't be here.
- What are you talking about?

805
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,600
- I don't want you getting hurt.
- It's too late for that.

806
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,500
No, listen to me.
It's your boss who's prosecuting me.

807
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,600
Your boss, for God's sake.

808
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,000
You can't have anything
to do with me.

809
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,000
I have everything to do with you.
I have no choice.

810
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,000
Have you thought about what would
happened to your career if Hunter

811
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,600
- found out about the two of us?
- My career?

812
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,900
Are you kidding me?
My career?

813
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,400
This is about your life here.

814
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,500
I'm gonna resign from the DA's office
and join your defense.

815
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,700
No. No, you can't do that.

816
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,900
You can't.
I'm gonna be okay.

817
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,100
- You sound like a Martian.
- I'm telling you I'm gonna be okay.

818
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,600
You're in a lot of trouble.

819
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,600
Promise me you're not gonna
do something stupid.

820
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,500
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

821
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,100
This has something to do
with Hunter, doesn't it?

822
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,600
- Why would you ask that?
- You have some kind of fixation with him.

823
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,700
This has something to do
with him, doesn't it?

824
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,000
I'm asking you to trust me.

825
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:58,500
There's something
you're not telling me.

826
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,000
Here's what you need to know:

827
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,100
I love you.

828
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,100
And I'm innocent.

829
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,500
I can't have you mixed up in this.

830
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,000
Please help me by understanding
what I'm saying.

831
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,800
Love me enough to trust me.

832
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,400
Can you do that?

833
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:30,900
Thank you.

834
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,500
After two days of jury selection,

835
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,600
the murder trial of Channel 8's
CJ Nicholas begins this morning

836
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,100
in what promises to be the most...

837
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,200
District Attorney Mark Hunter will
deliver his opening arguments

838
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,600
in what is expected...

839
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,900
...the most anticipated murder trials
in a long time,

840
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,700
television reporter CJ Nicholas
is scheduled to be here in just a moment.

841
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,800
- Hey, how you doing?
- No touching.

842
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,700
Don't worry.

843
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,000
Just remember, don't get
the DVD until I tell you.

844
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,100
We have to wait for Hunter
to introduce the fake evidence.

845
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,800
Otherwise we have nothing.
It's the whole ballgame.

846
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,400
- What's that about?
- Nothing.

847
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,700
He was just wishing me luck.

848
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,100
We could use some.

849
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,600
All rise.

850
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:40,100
Oyez oyez oyez.

851
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,100
Section 4 of the Honorable
First Judicial District Court

852
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,700
in and for the State of Louisiana,
Parish of Caddo,

853
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,500
is open and pursuant
to adjournment,

854
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,600
God save the state
and this honorable court.

855
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,100
Order and silence are commanded
under penalty of the law.

856
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,200
Please be seated.

857
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,500
- Are the people ready?
- We are, Your Honor.

858
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,300
- Is the defense ready?
- Defense is ready, Your Honor.

859
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,100
Then we'll begin with our
opening statements. Mr. Hunter.

860
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,500
Thank you, Your Honor.

861
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,600
Jane Doe's mother had a name,
which I can't reveal.

862
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,800
She had hopes
which can never be realized.

863
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:10,000
She had love
which has never returned.

864
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:13,200
And she had kindness
which was never given back to her.

865
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:17,000
Two weeks after that interview
Jane Doe's mother died of an overdose.

866
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,400
We can only hope for two things:

867
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,700
One, that she's reunited
with her baby daughter;

868
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,900
And two, that her death
was not totally in vain.

869
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,000
That can only be accomplished
if we realize

870
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,500
that the only difference
between Jane Doe and us

871
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,100
is the accident of where
we were born.

872
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,800
We had no control over it.

873
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:36,100
Therefore we are no better
nor more deserving than anyone else.

874
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,600
I'm CJ Nicholas.
Good night.

875
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,900
And after you saw the man with
the knife, what did you do?

876
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,300
Oh, I didn't have time to do anything.
Oliver just...

877
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:50,000
- Excuse me. Oliver?
- My dog.

878
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,700
He's a Jack Russell terrier
just like the one from "Frasier. "

879
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:53,800
They don't know they're small.

880
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,200
They are absolutely fearless.
It's amazing really.

881
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,700
Mr. Tarlow, what happened after
you saw the man with the knife?

882
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,000
Oliver just ran up and bit him.

883
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,800
- Where?
- On the calf of his left leg.

884
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,500
And Jack Russells
have very sharp teeth.

885
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,600
There were four stab wounds.

886
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,300
One severed the left carotid artery.

887
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,300
Another just beneath the sternum
punctured the aorta.

888
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,500
The remaining two
punctured the abdomen

889
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,200
and opened the small intestines.

890
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,000
Dr. Romans, I'd like you
to take a look at this knife

891
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,900
previously entered
as People's Exhibit C.

892
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,800
This was taken from
the defendant's apartment.

893
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,000
Could that be the murder weapon?

894
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:34,000
Yes, the blade's length and width
are the same as the stab wound.

895
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:38,800
And when you examined this knife
did you find any traces of blood on it?

896
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,600
No, it had recently been cleaned

897
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,200
with a strong industrial-strength
cleaning solution.

898
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:47,000
And deformities on the handle indicate
that it had been boiled.

899
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,100
Plus striations on the blade indicate

900
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,200
the blade had
recently been reground.

901
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,400
I have no more questions.
Thank you, Dr. Romans.

902
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,300
- Your witness.
- So just to be clear,

903
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,000
what you're saying
is you don't know

904
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,400
if this is the actual
murder weapon or not.

905
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,500
No.

906
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,900
Thank you.
No further questions.

907
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,900
The dog bite on Mr. Nicholas's left calf

908
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,600
was consistent with a dog bite
from a dog of that size and breed.

909
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,400
Now you found a shoeprint at the scene.

910
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,500
What kind of shoe was that?

911
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,500
They belonged to a Montalvo sneaker.

912
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,000
Similar to the shoes
owned by the defendant

913
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,700
marked for evidence
as People's Exhibit D?

914
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,400
Yes.

915
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,500
Now is that a popular brand sneaker?

916
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,900
No, they're extremely rare.

917
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,200
In fact, there isn't a single store
in Shreveport that carries them.

918
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,500
And did you compare the defendant's
sneaker with the print at the scene?

919
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,500
Yes. They were a match
for both size and weight.

920
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,700
Now the mask,
the ski mask

921
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,800
that was found
at the defendant's apartment

922
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:02,500
marked as People's Exhibit E.
What can you tell me about this?

923
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,900
We found pepper spray
around the eyeholes

924
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,300
on the outside.
Someone had sprayed it.

925
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,700
It was consistent with the pepper
spray belonging to the victim.

926
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,100
Thank you.
I have no more questions, Your Honor.

927
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:18,300
Now you can't actually tell us
that the bite on my client's calf

928
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,800
- came from Mr. Tarlow's dog?
- No.

929
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:24,000
So it could have come from any dog
of similar size and breed,

930
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:27,200
- like the one owned by my client in fact?
- Yes, that's right.

931
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,300
The crime scene photos show

932
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,900
that there was considerable blood
spatter caused by the attack.

933
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,200
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

934
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,800
And yet when you examined
the defendant's clothing,

935
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,800
entered into evidence
as People's Exhibit E,

936
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,500
you found no traces of blood at all.

937
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,900
No, but the client had time...

938
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,500
Just a yes or no will be sufficient.

939
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,200
So in fact, would it be fair to say

940
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:54,700
that there is no direct
forensic evidence whatsoever

941
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:57,500
connecting my client to this crime?

942
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,400
Yes.

943
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,300
No further questions.

944
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,100
So sorry.

945
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,700
Yeah?

946
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,100
You'll excuse me for one minute.

947
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,900
- Sorry, honey.
- It's okay.

948
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,900
This better be good.

949
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,400
So what the hell kind
of emergency is this?

950
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,200
- We checked Nicholas's financials again.
- Yeah.

951
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:50,900
He bought a video camera at Wright's
Audio two days after the murder.

952
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,100
There's a point to this, right?

953
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,100
He also bought a black Reebok
jogging suit and a ski mask

954
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,400
at the sporting goods store.

955
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,500
He bought a dog
at the animal shelter.

956
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,100
All this within a day of buying
the video camera.

957
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,300
Something doesn't smell right.

958
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,500
So when he went on this shopping spree,
was he alone?

959
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,500
People at the sporting goods
store can't remember.

960
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,500
Salesclerk at Wright's Audio said he
might have been with someone.

961
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,000
The man at the animal shelter,
for sure

962
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:17,800
remembers he was with another man.

963
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:20,200
- Do you know who this man is?
- I'm pretty sure.

964
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:24,900
Well, if someone did a video,
then this man's got it.

965
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,300
You think we're being set up?

966
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,700
We can't have that, can we?

967
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:39,500
Now would you please tell the court what
you found on the defendant's pants?

968
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,600
On request of the DA's office,
we retested the defendant's clothing.

969
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,200
And what did you find on it?

970
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,800
We found small traces of blood
on the seams of his sweatpants.

971
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,000
We missed it the first time.
It happens.

972
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:53,100
You Honor, we were given no
prior notice of this testimony.

973
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,000
Judge, we only discovered
this evidence yesterday.

974
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,200
I'll allow it.
Don't worry, Counselor.

975
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:00,600
I'll give you time
to examine this evidence.

976
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,100
Did you do a DNA analysis
of the blood

977
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,300
that you found
on the defendant's pants?

978
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,200
- Yes I did.
- And what did that analysis show you?

979
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,700
The blood belonged to the victim.

980
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,500
I have no more questions,
Your Honor.

981
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,800
Excuse me.

982
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,700
Stop.

983
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,400
Oh shit.

984
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,000
Your Honor, the prosecution rests.

985
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:21,500
Are you ready to call
your first witness, Counselor?

986
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:25,000
Yes, Your Honor. The defense would
like to call Dr. Aaron Wakefield.

987
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,500
Go.
Stop stop.

988
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,300
Stop stop.
Stop!

989
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,900
Excuse me. Sorry.

990
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,300
Hi, I need to open
my safety deposit box.

991
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,900
My name's Corey Finley.
Here's my ID.

992
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,500
Certainly, Mr. Findley.

993
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,800
Oh, it's actually Finley.
No D.

994
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:57,700
Oh. That would explain why
I cannot find your record.

995
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,800
Probably, yeah.

996
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,900
You know, I have a cousin
named Findley.

997
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,600
- You do?
- With a D.

998
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,200
Second cousin really.

999
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:07,300
Or is it first cousin once removed?

1000
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,100
I can never figure that out.

1001
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,900
You see, she's married
to my first cousin.

1002
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,500
Do you know how
that removed thing works?

1003
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,000
No, I don't really...
you know, if we could possibly...

1004
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:18,000
Here it is.
Corey Finley no D.

1005
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,300
Do you have your key
with you, Mr. Finley no D?

1006
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,400
Yes, I do. I have my key.
There it is.

1007
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,700
- Oh, good.
- Okay.

1008
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,000
Hey.

1009
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,600
Okay.

1010
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:31,600
It's right in here.

1011
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,800
150, 151...

1012
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:39,100
2263, found it.
It's right here. It's right there.

1013
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,600
Well, of course.
There it is.

1014
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,100
Okay, here's my key.

1015
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,200
Do you think that we
could speed this up?

1016
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,300
- I'm in a bit of a rush.
- No.

1017
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,400
Okay.

1018
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,200
- Care for a private booth?
- No thank you.

1019
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,400
Mr. Finley!

1020
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,700
Oh!

1021
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,300
Ow.

1022
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,600
Excuse me.
Excuse me, stop.

1023
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,100
Sorry.

1024
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:19,500
And in your opinion, Dr. Wakefield,

1025
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:23,300
could those wounds have been
caused by a knife other than the one

1026
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,500
- belonging to the defendant?
- Absolutely.

1027
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,800
Any blade of that
approximate length

1028
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,000
or width could have
caused those wounds.

1029
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,500
There are hundreds
of knives with blades that size.

1030
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,900
Call your next witness, Mr. Spota.

1031
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,700
I can't keep stalling.

1032
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,000
Where is this surprise witness
you keep telling me about?

1033
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:47,400
He'll be here any second.

1034
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,500
You've been saying that
for the past four hours.

1035
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,600
- He should have been here by now.
- Counselor?

1036
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,600
Uh, Your Honor,

1037
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:58,700
we're expecting the appearance
of a rebuttal witness.

1038
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,300
Well, do you know where he is?

1039
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,500
Uh...

1040
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,300
no, Your Honor.

1041
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,200
Your Honor, the defense requests
a continuance at this time

1042
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:17,300
so we can examine the prosecution's
new forensic evidence.

1043
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,900
Motion granted.

1044
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,200
We'll meet back here at 9:00 AM
Monday morning.

1045
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,300
Court adjourned.

1046
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:44,100
Counselor, is the defense
ready to continue?

1047
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:45,400
We are, Your Honor.

1048
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,000
The defense calls CJ Nicholas.

1049
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:03,900
Raise your right hand.

1050
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

1051
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,600
- so help you God?
- I do.

1052
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,700
Be seated.

1053
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,600
- Did you murder Doris Ruth Owens?
- I did not.

1054
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:26,000
So why are you on trial here today?

1055
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,200
'Cause I wanted to be.

1056
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,400
What do you mean?

1057
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,400
I deliberately implicated
myself in the crime.

1058
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,000
- Why would you do such a thing?
- I was working on a story

1059
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,100
about the DA's office planting
forensic evidence

1060
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:40,200
in murder trials
in order to obtain guilty verdicts.

1061
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,500
Your Honor, that is
an outrageous statement.

1062
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:46,100
I felt the only way that I could uncover
evidence of corruption in the DA's office

1063
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:47,600
was to implicate myself
in the crime,

1064
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:51,300
to see if the DA would fabricate DNA
evidence which he now has done.

1065
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,400
Silence.

1066
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,000
Did you know about this?

1067
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:04,300
Not until my client told me
yesterday, Your Honor.

1068
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:07,300
- Is this true?
- Yes, Your Honor.

1069
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,200
- And you have evidence to support this?
- We do.

1070
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:13,300
Your Honor, I am not
even gonna begin to deal

1071
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:16,400
with how insulting
and defamatory this is.

1072
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:20,100
However, it is obvious that
the defense is desperate.

1073
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:23,600
They're trying to create a jury nullification
so you'll call for a mistrial

1074
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:26,000
because they know
they're going to lose.

1075
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:30,000
You cannot allow them to present
this ridiculous defense.

1076
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,700
The prosecution opened
the door, Your Honor,

1077
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,900
by introducing last-minute
forensic evidence.

1078
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,200
My client is on trial for his life.

1079
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:39,400
He should be given every latitude.

1080
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,300
You say you have evidence.
I'll give you a chance to present it.

1081
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,700
I will not... I repeat, will not

1082
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:48,200
let you simply make wild
and damaging accusations.

1083
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,100
Understand me, Mr. Nicholas?

1084
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,900
Oh, there will be no mistrial.

1085
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,100
There will be a contempt of court
citation for you, Mr. Spota,

1086
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,800
if your proof turns out
to be not proof.

1087
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,000
- We understand, Your Honor.
- You may continue,

1088
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:04,500
- although you are on a very short leash.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

1089
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,200
Now, CJ, please tell the court
why you have done this.

1090
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:09,000
I had been investigating
the DA for some time.

1091
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:12,100
There had been a series of cases
in which last-minute forensic evidence,

1092
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:14,500
always DNA, was introduced.
So I investigated further

1093
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:17,300
and I became convinced that
the DA was planting evidence.

1094
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,000
But why go to such
extraordinary lengths?

1095
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:22,100
It was my last resort.
My editor told me to back off it.

1096
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:24,400
I couldn't make my suspicions
public without proof.

1097
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,800
- So what did you do?
- I found out the details of the case

1098
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:29,800
from Detective Nickerson. Then I went out
and bought a Jack Russell terrier

1099
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:31,600
and got him to bite me
on the left calf.

1100
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:34,100
Then I bought the switchblade,
the pants and the sneakers.

1101
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,100
This is a receipt for the sneakers

1102
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,700
I'd like to mark
as Defense Exhibit A.

1103
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,500
You can see that it is clearly dated

1104
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,300
three days
after the murder took place.

1105
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,500
This is a receipt for the sweatpants,
Defense Exhibit B.

1106
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,300
Again, dated after the murder.

1107
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,400
So if you bought the sweatpants
after the murder took place,

1108
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,400
how did the victim's blood get on it?

1109
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,500
The only answer
is the DA put it there.

1110
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:59,100
So you're saying because the DA's case
was purely circumstantial,

1111
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:02,100
he planted the evidence to tie
you to the murder scene?

1112
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:04,000
Yes.

1113
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,200
No further questions,
Your Honor.

1114
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,300
That's it?

1115
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,400
That's the proof

1116
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:28,600
that I'm a calculating
dishonest man?

1117
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,500
Not to mention a felon?

1118
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:33,800
A couple receipts
for a pair of sweatpants?

1119
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:37,100
My office and myself
is a bastion of corruption

1120
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,700
because you bought
a pair of sweatpants

1121
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,300
a few days after the murder.

1122
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,600
I've got to hand it to you,
you're something else.

1123
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:45,400
- And the sneakers.
- Oh, the sneakers.

1124
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:48,300
I forgot about the sneakers.
Well, that seals the deal right there.

1125
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,000
Judge, you've got to put
the cuffs on me right now.

1126
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:55,700
I agree.

1127
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,100
Do you...

1128
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,600
and I use this word very loosely...

1129
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,600
do you have any proof?

1130
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:16,700
I made a DVD
documenting the purchases.

1131
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,100
- Everything.
- And where is that DVD?

1132
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,300
My colleague who shot it...

1133
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,400
was killed in an accident
on his way to the courthouse.

1134
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,300
And the disc was destroyed.

1135
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:35,900
Well, I'm very sorry
about your colleague.

1136
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,200
But other than you saying

1137
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:42,700
that you have a DVD
that backs up your claims,

1138
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:45,600
is there...
and I use this word

1139
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,100
again lightly...

1140
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,600
is there any proof

1141
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,100
that that DVD exists?

1142
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:58,000
I'm sorry,
I didn't hear your answer.

1143
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:00,200
Answer the question,
Mr. Nicholas.

1144
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:07,600
- No.
- No, you will not answer the question

1145
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,800
or no you have no proof it exists?

1146
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,200
No, all you have is my word.

1147
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:15,400
Well, that's kind of on
shaky ground right now, isn't it?

1148
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,800
That's not for me to say.

1149
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:20,600
You know what, Mr. Nicholas?

1150
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:23,000
That's the first thing
that you've said

1151
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,300
that I agree with.

1152
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,700
It's for the jury to decide, isn't it?

1153
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,400
Now I have just one more question,

1154
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:41,700
one little pesky question.

1155
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:45,300
The fact that you bought
a pair of sneakers

1156
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:48,900
and sweatpants sometime
after the murder,

1157
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,700
the fact that you bought anything
after the murder,

1158
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:56,200
does that mean that you couldn't
have owned a pair of sneakers

1159
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:59,600
or sweatpants or bought
anything else for that matter

1160
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:01,400
before the murder?

1161
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,200
I'm sorry, I did not hear
your answer.

1162
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,900
I guess not.

1163
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,300
Thank you.

1164
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,500
Despite the sensational claims
made by the defense,

1165
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,900
CJ Nicholas was found guilty
today of first-degree murder.

1166
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:29,900
It took the jury less than five hours

1167
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,900
to return a verdict of guilty

1168
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,200
in the murder trial of Channel 8's
CJ Nicholas.

1169
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,300
Sentencing is next week.

1170
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:39,600
DA Hunter said that the state
will seek the death penalty

1171
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,700
due to the viciousness of the crime.

1172
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:52,700
Thanks.
Thanks for coming.

1173
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,100
What's wrong with you?
Of course I'd come.

1174
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,400
I have a speech.

1175
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,200
I've been rehearsing it
over and over.

1176
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:00,500
God knows I've had the time.

1177
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,600
I kinda thought I had it down,
you know?

1178
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:04,600
But now my mouth's all cotton.

1179
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:07,000
Okay, here it goes.

1180
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,800
The last time I saw you,
you said that you believed in me.

1181
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,700
You said you knew
I couldn't have done this.

1182
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,600
Then you saw the evidence at the trial
and you said to yourself,

1183
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,500
"I want to believe him.
I have to. "

1184
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,300
There's all this evidence.
So much.

1185
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,500
And then the DNA evidence.
That was the last straw, wasn't it?

1186
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,500
It was the clincher.
That's why you now think I'm a murderer.

1187
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,000
- I don't.
- Yes you do.

1188
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,800
And it's all right.
You don't have to lie.

1189
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:31,600
I don't blame you.

1190
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:33,300
I just want you to listen.

1191
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,700
If there was ever a time
that you loved me,

1192
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,200
if there was ever a time you thought
I was a good person,

1193
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,000
then I want you to hear this.

1194
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:43,700
What I said at the trial was true.

1195
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,300
The DNA was planted by your boss,

1196
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,900
just like he planted the DNA evidence
on that cigarette in the Andre Benson case.

1197
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,300
Now I know you've never met a defendant
that didn't protest his innocence,

1198
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:55,400
but I swear it's true.

1199
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,300
Finley had the disc that proved it all.

1200
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,100
And I think that Hunter had him killed

1201
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,500
because the disc that Finley had
locked in his desk went missing.

1202
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,400
I know that sounds crazy.

1203
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:08,000
- I believe you.
- Listen to me.

1204
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:09,500
I'm asking you not to believe me.

1205
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,200
I'm begging you to go
and find out for yourself.

1206
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:13,900
Be skeptical.
Be suspicious.

1207
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,300
Do some digging on your own.
I know how good you are.

1208
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,800
Please, you're my last hope.

1209
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:22,500
Why would I ask you to do
any of this if I'm guilty?

1210
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:25,700
Why would I ask you to find out
the truth if the truth was bad for me?

1211
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:28,200
Because you have nothing left to lose.

1212
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,300
Oh, Ella.

1213
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,600
You're so so wrong.

1214
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:34,900
I have you to lose.

1215
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:38,900
Death by lethal injection...

1216
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,400
that was the sentence
handed down by the jury

1217
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,300
in the CJ Nicholas murder trial,

1218
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:46,200
the verdict
in the penalty phase of the trial.

1219
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,900
Nicholas, when asked
if he had anything to say,

1220
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,300
maintained his innocence
and said that the real facts

1221
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:53,100
would someday be revealed.

1222
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,600
Nicholas was driven from the court
directly to death row

1223
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:57,000
at the Louisiana State Prison

1224
01:11:57,100 --> 01:12:00,400
where he will live in complete
isolation for up to 20 hours a day

1225
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,800
until his appeal process is exhausted.

1226
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,800
This is not a happy day
for anyone.

1227
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:11,600
No life is more precious than another.

1228
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:14,600
Doris Ruth Owens's life
was taken from her.

1229
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,100
We cannot bring that back.

1230
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,600
And the young man CJ Nicholas
has forfeited his life.

1231
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,500
There's nothing to celebrate.

1232
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,800
Two lives are going to be lost,

1233
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:26,400
one cut short, the other wasted.

1234
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,900
And the only thing that I can say

1235
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,900
is that the jury's verdict serves justice.

1236
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:34,700
And in that way
it does serve us all.

1237
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:39,200
When I started to walk away,
I couldn't look back.

1238
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:42,800
I just couldn't see her wrapped
in all those newspapers

1239
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,600
in front of the church.
I couldn't.

1240
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:49,200
I knew she was safe

1241
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,600
and warm,

1242
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,900
that she was with God.

1243
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:55,100
Still...

1244
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,900
I couldn't look back.

1245
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,100
Jane Doe's mother had a name,
which I can't reveal.

1246
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:03,500
She had hopes
which can never be realized.

1247
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,700
She had love...

1248
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,200
May I ask you why you are questioning
me about Nicholas and Finley?

1249
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,600
I'm not representing
the district attorney's office.

1250
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:13,300
There's nothing official about this,
I promise.

1251
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,100
Why are you here?

1252
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:18,600
Please, it's strictly personal.
I'm asking for your help.

1253
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:22,200
If anyone finds out that I was here talking
to you I could get in a lot of trouble.

1254
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:24,700
Now if... and this is a big if...

1255
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,100
if there is a story here,
you have my word it will be yours.

1256
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,900
But again, I don't think
there's anything here at all.

1257
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,700
What do you want to know?

1258
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:35,100
Did CJ come to you about the story
of the DA planting evidence?

1259
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:39,100
Yeah, he claimed that Hunter planted DNA
evidence in the Andre Benson case.

1260
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,900
He said there were a lot
of other cases too.

1261
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,600
But you've got to understand,
with a guy like CJ,

1262
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:43,900
he always had some big story

1263
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,600
that was just one phone call away,
one source away.

1264
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:49,200
The problem was
he had hunches and very little else.

1265
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,000
What was he basing
these hunches on?

1266
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:53,000
He had a copy of the Andre Benson
interview tape.

1267
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,000
He claimed that the cigarette
that he was smoking

1268
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:56,400
on the tape turned up
at the crime scene.

1269
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,700
Now I asked him how could you
plant evidence at a crime scene

1270
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,700
after the crime scene photos
were taken?

1271
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,700
- Was he doing this alone?
- No.

1272
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,300
He dragged poor Finley into it.

1273
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:10,800
- Ella.
- Bruce.

1274
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:12,200
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

1275
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:13,700
- I'm good.
- Did you bring the information?

1276
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,200
Is that the only reason
you asked me here?

1277
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,200
Oh, stop it.
Honestly.

1278
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:19,200
- Thank you.
- What's this all about anyway?

1279
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:22,100
It's about us getting in a lot
of trouble if anyone finds out.

1280
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:25,800
So your lab did the DNA testing
for all 17 of these cases?

1281
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,500
- Yes.
- Was there anything unusual about them?

1282
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,000
- No, not really.
- Nothing?

1283
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,400
- Well...
- Well what?

1284
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,200
It's not something
I can put my finger on.

1285
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:35,000
Put another body part on it.
What is it?

1286
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,600
It's just that some of
the DNA samples,

1287
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,100
they came in at the last minute.

1288
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,900
- And that's unusual?
- Kind of. Sometimes.

1289
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,200
How many of the 17 cases?

1290
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,100
Most.

1291
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:47,700
Oh yeah, I remember them.

1292
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,700
How could I ever forget?
They seemed like such a nice couple.

1293
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:53,300
The one with the beard
always wanted to take pictures.

1294
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:56,000
And it turns out the nicer looking one
was a murderer.

1295
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,600
And I was standing this close to him.

1296
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:01,700
It gives me shivers.
I guess you can never tell, can you?

1297
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,800
No, I guess you can't.

1298
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,300
Hello?

1299
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:57,200
Operator, I'll accept.

1300
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:00,000
Ella, listen.

1301
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:02,400
When Finley went home and found
the disc was missing,

1302
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,500
he would have gone for backup.
Now think.

1303
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:07,000
What's the absolutely safest place
you could keep something?

1304
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:10,900
Um, maybe with somebody else.
Where does his mother live?

1305
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,600
Both of his parents are dead.

1306
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,100
- What about a friend?
- I was his closest friend.

1307
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:20,200
Um, a bank.

1308
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:21,800
A safety deposit box.

1309
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:24,400
Yes.
Yes, that makes sense.

1310
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:27,200
Okay, his bank was
the Pelican Bank & Trust.

1311
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:29,500
Oh yes, I remember him vividly.

1312
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,800
He was in a terrible hurry.

1313
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:33,900
No D in his name,

1314
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,600
unlike my second
cousin or whatever he is.

1315
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:39,400
Rush rush rush.

1316
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:43,100
He simply took something
out of his safe deposit box

1317
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,600
and literally ran out of here.

1318
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:48,100
No private cubicle,
nothing.

1319
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,200
He didn't even take his key.

1320
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:52,000
I've never seen anything
quite like it.

1321
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:53,500
Did you see what he removed
from the box?

1322
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,500
Oh, we're not allowed to do that.

1323
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,800
Our customers are guaranteed
complete privacy.

1324
01:16:57,900 --> 01:17:00,300
I appreciate that, Ms. Urlanger.

1325
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,400
Miss Urlanger.
Never quite liked Ms.

1326
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,600
Sounds like a beehive.

1327
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:07,300
Um, you said he reached for
the box right in front of you.

1328
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:09,900
It's possible that you saw
what he removed

1329
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:12,400
because you couldn't avoid it,
isn't it?

1330
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:15,700
Well, now that you mention it,
maybe I kind of saw something.

1331
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,400
A plastic thingy
with something shiny inside.

1332
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:21,000
- A computer disc maybe?
- Maybe.

1333
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,100
The till is directly linked
to my inventory.

1334
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:27,700
When I scan the barcode

1335
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,900
it logs the product
and the manufacturer's number.

1336
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,600
Right, so you can match any receipt
with an item that's been purchased?

1337
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,000
Yup, as long as it has
the manufacturer's label.

1338
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,800
But I already told you guys this.

1339
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,700
You spoke to someone
from my office?

1340
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:42,200
- Yeah.
- Do you remember who?

1341
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,700
Yes, he said he was the DA.

1342
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:19,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

1343
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:21,900
I called about seeing the Nicholas
case evidence box.

1344
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,400
Right, you're from the DA's office.

1345
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,600
- Yeah, I have a case number.
- That's okay. I already pulled it for you.

1346
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:27,400
- Oh, thank you.
- Uh-huh.

1347
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:31,300
Great, thanks.

1348
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,100
Ella?

1349
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,600
What are you doing here so late?

1350
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:16,000
I was just looking at the...

1351
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:18,900
the original police file
on the Belmont case.

1352
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:20,700
I'm not familiar with that case.

1353
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,700
It's a carjacking.
We brought him in two days ago.

1354
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,800
- You know Lieutenant Merchant.
- Yes, hi.

1355
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:27,600
- You keep late hours.
- So do you.

1356
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:31,100
I hope you're not letting your personal
life interfere with your work.

1357
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,600
What?

1358
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,700
You look tired.
You should get some rest.

1359
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,800
Yeah, I was actually
just on my way home.

1360
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:39,000
If you don't get any rest,
you can come down with something.

1361
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,300
And health is the most
important thing we have.

1362
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,400
Absolutely.

1363
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:49,000
- Good night, Ella.
- Good night, sir.

1364
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:07,000
Let me ask you something.

1365
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:09,900
If you had to run back to
your safety deposit box

1366
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,000
to get your backup disc,

1367
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:13,400
wouldn't that mean that there's
an original disc missing?

1368
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:14,700
And would it be missing?

1369
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,600
I mean, that's just not the kind
of thing that disappears, right?

1370
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:20,700
Maybe you lose your cell phone
or your keys or something,

1371
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,600
but definitely not

1372
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:26,400
the single most important piece
of evidence in your entire life.

1373
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:30,300
Are you listening to me?

1374
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,000
Look, I've been thinking
over and over.

1375
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:34,700
When I showed the tape to Weldon

1376
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,600
of Merchant giving that
cigarette to Andre Benson,

1377
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,800
Weldon said,
"How could that mean anything

1378
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:41,700
since the tape was made three days after
the crime scene photographs were taken?"

1379
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,700
But what if the crime photos
were doctored?

1380
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,100
What if they altered
the photo somehow?

1381
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:48,800
What if they put the cigarette
butt in after the photo was taken?

1382
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,700
Shit.

1383
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,500
I am not good at this.

1384
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,000
Look, it's okay.
I understand.

1385
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:59,200
I'm your intern,
you're an assistant DA.

1386
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,900
You don't ask interns to lunch
unless you want something.

1387
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:03,800
So just ask me.

1388
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:05,600
Listen, you know your partner?

1389
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:07,400
Roberta?
You remember her?

1390
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,300
Yeah, I remember
she's getting her PhD

1391
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,300
in computer science
from the university, right?

1392
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,600
- You do remember.
- Well, it's kind of delicate,

1393
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,800
but I need to speak
to an expert in digital imagery.

1394
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:17,700
- You mean digital forensics?
- Yes, exactly.

1395
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,000
Well, she can help you.

1396
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:21,200
If she doesn't have the answers for you
she knows the people who do.

1397
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:23,500
Great. Can you arrange a meeting
between the two of us?

1398
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:24,800
- Of course. When?
- Tonight?

1399
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:27,000
- Tonight?
- It's kind of a secret.

1400
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:29,100
A secret is good.
I like secrets.

1401
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,600
I mean, absolutely no one at the DA's
office can know about this.

1402
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,000
Absolutely no one.
It cannot go through the regular channels.

1403
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,900
I'll set it up for tonight.

1404
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:41,100
Danielle, there could
be danger here.

1405
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:45,500
Danger?

1406
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,000
Hi.

1407
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,300
What can I do for you this
evening, Miss Crystal?

1408
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:55,300
I'm really sorry
to bother you, Sergeant,

1409
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,800
especially after hours.

1410
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:58,500
It's just I am overwhelmed
with casework and...

1411
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:02,900
I haven't even been able
to start my report for DA Hunter.

1412
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:04,100
He's gonna have my ass tomorrow if...

1413
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,300
Am I supposed to be following you
on all of this?

1414
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:07,500
Oh, sorry.

1415
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,700
I get kind of wound up
when I'm nervous.

1416
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:13,100
We're doing an in-house study
on how crime scene evidence,

1417
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,100
specifically photos,
are archived

1418
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,400
by both the state
and local police departments...

1419
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,600
if there's anything we can do
to improve that system,

1420
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:21,700
you know, keep the bad guys in prison.

1421
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,600
Which brings me back
to my first question:

1422
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:26,600
Is there anything I can do for you
this evening, Miss Crystal?

1423
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:29,600
Yes. Would you please show me
how and where the digital images

1424
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,800
are downloaded from
the photographers' CF cards?

1425
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:34,800
How safe are they? Oh, and also,
are they JPEG compressed files

1426
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:37,900
or are they uncompressed? I want to
compare that to the sheriff's office.

1427
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:43,100
If you look down there, there's a big old
double-bolted metal door.

1428
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,000
Now all the physical
evidence is stored in there

1429
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:47,500
along with the hard drives.
And only the evidence sergeant

1430
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:48,900
has the combination to the lock.

1431
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:50,800
As far as images go,

1432
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:53,700
I don't know if they're J-whatever-
you-said or not.

1433
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,600
They're all stored on a server.

1434
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:59,100
And you can't access to it without
somebody with a passcode.

1435
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,700
And there ain't too many somebodies
with a passcode.

1436
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,300
And you might be one
of those somebodies?

1437
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:04,900
No doubt.

1438
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,500
Can you show them to me?
Please?

1439
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,800
You got a case number?

1440
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:16,600
Me? No.
Anything is fine.

1441
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:19,400
Let's see.
How about 11151?

1442
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,300
That's from...

1443
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:24,300
May 21, 2006.

1444
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,200
Sure, that's fine.

1445
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:29,900
Evidence Sergeant Gilbert.

1446
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,700
This is Colletti from Major Crime.

1447
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:35,000
We need the skirt and blouse
from case 18446.

1448
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:37,500
We need to do a DNA match
with the perp we've got in custody.

1449
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,700
We might have just caught ourselves
a serial rapist.

1450
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,100
I need to know if you have it.

1451
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:42,300
You want me to go
get it right now?

1452
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,300
No, I want you tell my captain
he'll get it tomorrow instead.

1453
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,300
All right, hang on.

1454
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,000
Goddamn son of a bitch.

1455
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:52,200
It's like goddamn
rush hour around here.

1456
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,300
Goddamn son of a bitch.

1457
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,400
I'm on a circus train
that's full of midgets.

1458
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,400
Goddamn son of a bitch.

1459
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,300
Everything has got to be right now.

1460
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:09,800
I've got your goddamn
right now right here.

1461
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:16,100
Okay.

1462
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:29,800
Okay, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

1463
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:40,400
Damn it.
Son of a bitch clown crap.

1464
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:43,500
Everything's right now.
God damn it.

1465
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:48,000
If I wanted to talk to people
I would have stayed in vice.

1466
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:54,700
Right now, right now, right now.

1467
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,500
Goddamn everything's got to be
goddamn right now.

1468
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:58,800
Son of a bitch.

1469
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:00,800
No, we ain't got it down here.

1470
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:03,600
Are you sure?
Case 18446, you don't have it?

1471
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:05,800
I'm sure 'cause ain't nobody
logged it in neither.

1472
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:07,200
They must have
got the number wrong.

1473
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:09,300
I'm in some major shit here.
I'll call you back.

1474
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:10,700
Yeah, you do that.

1475
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,500
Ow!

1476
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:00,600
So how you doing, ace?

1477
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:07,100
What's this all about?

1478
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,200
- Guard!
- Easy easy.

1479
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,800
Just want to see how you're getting on.

1480
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:16,100
Is the food okay?
They taking care of you?

1481
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,300
You know, sometimes it gets kinda
lonely in here.

1482
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,800
Why don't you just cut the bullshit?
You want something. What is it?

1483
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:24,500
Can't a guy even come by
and see how you're doing?

1484
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:27,200
- What the hell do you want?
- World peace. What do you want?

1485
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:30,100
I want everyone to know
what a scumbag you really are.

1486
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:32,200
- Oh, me?
- Yeah, you.

1487
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:33,500
No.

1488
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,000
No, I put away the bad guys.

1489
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,400
You planted the evidence.

1490
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:50,400
You do know they monitor
the phones here, don't you?

1491
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,000
You take care, ace.

1492
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:02,300
You son of a bitch!

1493
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:14,500
Hi. Come on in here.

1494
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:18,100
Ella?

1495
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:19,300
- You must be Roberta.
- Yeah.

1496
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,900
You and Danielle may
turn out to be lifesavers.

1497
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,200
I mean literal lifesavers.
I can't thank you enough.

1498
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:25,400
Do you have it? I want to see it.
She has it, right?

1499
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:28,700
Ella, this is Dell and Allen.
They're both post-doctorates here.

1500
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:30,700
Sociability is not their strong suit.

1501
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:32,200
- Say hello to Ella.
- Hello.

1502
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:33,800
- Do you have it?
- Here you go, fellas.

1503
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:35,900
They're not used to actually speaking
to other vertebrates,

1504
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
- so be patient.
- Right.

1505
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,100
Uh, the second one there.

1506
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,600
- Are these real dead people?
- I'm afraid so.

1507
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:48,400
These are great.
Can I make a copy?

1508
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,100
No, Allen.
That would be against the law.

1509
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:51,800
I'm Dell.

1510
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:53,600
He's Allen.

1511
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:56,400
Sorry, Dell.
Can you open this photograph right here?

1512
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,800
All right,
here's what I'm looking for.

1513
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,600
You see this cigarette right here?

1514
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:06,300
I need to know if you think it's possible
that this cigarette was added after the fact.

1515
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:08,700
They're uncompressed.
24 megs, that's good.

1516
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,700
- Why's that good?
- The more resolution the more metadata.

1517
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:13,100
- Metadata?
- She doesn't know what metadata is.

1518
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:15,600
She knows lots of stuff
that you don't know.

1519
01:28:15,700 --> 01:28:17,100
Metadata is literally
data about data.

1520
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:19,900
Digital images are comprised of pixels.
That's the data.

1521
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,200
If you look closer you find
that there's metadata

1522
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:24,300
around the pixels.
Watch. Look over here.

1523
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:25,500
- See the patterns?
- Uh-huh.

1524
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:28,600
Tell her about what Lukas and Fridrich
and Goljan found.

1525
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:31,200
Tell her about the statistic
characteristics of imaging sensors.

1526
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:32,300
Shut up.

1527
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,800
Three researchers at Binghamton

1528
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:36,500
found that cameras
have a pattern noise

1529
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:38,000
and if you look closely enough

1530
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:40,300
you can find that there is a difference
in the pattern noise

1531
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:43,400
of the algorithm of each camera
even though they're mass manufactured.

1532
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:44,900
There's a subtle difference
in each one.

1533
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,700
It's actually like
a digital fingerprint.

1534
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:50,500
So let's look at the pattern
on this part of the image.

1535
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:51,900
- See it?
- Uh-huh.

1536
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,100
Now let's move over to the cigarette
and see that pattern.

1537
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,000
It's different.
Can you see it?

1538
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:06,200
That cigarette was definitely not
part of the original photograph.

1539
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:08,200
Oh my God.

1540
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,500
Shit.

1541
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,000
What was it?
Two, three, four.

1542
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:50,500
Four orange.
Orange orange.

1543
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:58,900
Where is it?

1544
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:01,200
Ah.

1545
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:24,500
Oh!

1546
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:29,800
You all right?

1547
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:37,100
- How'd you know?
- I was following him following you.

1548
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:38,300
Never liked that son of a bitch.

1549
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,000
I knew he was up to something
so I followed him.

1550
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:41,700
I don't know what else
to say but thank you.

1551
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:45,000
It's what I do.
We ain't all like him.

1552
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,200
I know.
I know.

1553
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:51,500
I've got to call this in.
It's gonna be a shitstorm.

1554
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:53,600
He's not the only part.

1555
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:56,000
This storm's bigger than you think.

1556
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:58,400
We could be talking Katrina here.

1557
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:00,800
In an incredible turn of events,

1558
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:03,300
District Attorney Mark Hunter
was arrested

1559
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:05,700
and charged with the falsifying
of evidence

1560
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:07,400
in the murder trial of Andre Benson

1561
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:11,100
causing a mistrial in that case
and 17 others,

1562
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:14,400
including the trial of Channel 8 reporter
CJ Nicholas.

1563
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,000
Hunter was taken to the county jail

1564
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:18,600
and booked this afternoon.
Bail is pending.

1565
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:32,400
Harold Rice, who is now
the acting district attorney,

1566
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:35,400
said that his office has to
review the Nicholas trial

1567
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:38,600
along with the others
because all DNA evidence

1568
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:40,400
in these trials is now suspect.

1569
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:42,800
Rice said that he has serious doubts

1570
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:45,000
that there was enough
evidence to retry Nicholas

1571
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:47,100
as the case was circumstantial

1572
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:50,000
and not that strong
without the DNA evidence.

1573
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:53,600
As a result, he saw no reason
to keep him in prison.

1574
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:56,000
News 8's Kelly Gertner reports.

1575
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:58,300
The scene was a madhouse today

1576
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:00,500
outside Louisiana State Prison

1577
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:03,700
as CJ Nicholas went from death row
to freedom

1578
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:05,200
in a matter of hours.

1579
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:07,500
As his taxi sped away
from the prison

1580
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,900
one could not escape being
struck by three things...

1581
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:14,900
the rise and spectacular fall
of Mark Hunter

1582
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:16,700
who before this afternoon

1583
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:19,100
was destined
to be our next governor

1584
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:20,700
and is now in jail;

1585
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:25,300
the fall and now
possibly spectacular rise

1586
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:29,500
of CJ Nicholas who before this
afternoon was facing execution

1587
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:33,900
and is now free and about
to become a national celebrity;

1588
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:36,600
Doris Ruth Owens...

1589
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:38,800
the young woman
found dead in the park

1590
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:42,300
shown here when she was arrested
for prostitution...

1591
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:44,400
her case is now open again

1592
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:47,000
and will likely remain unsolved.

1593
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:50,300
She will become one
of those statistics,

1594
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:52,600
an unsolved case involving

1595
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:55,300
a relatively unknown young woman.

1596
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:09,800
She was so little.

1597
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,600
...felt her grow

1598
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,400
you know, cold.

1599
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:21,400
Hey.

1600
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:23,200
You don't have to watch
that thing again.

1601
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:24,900
Turn it off and come back
to bed with me.

1602
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,400
I'm so dumb.
I didn't believe you about Hunter.

1603
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:29,200
You were right all along.
I'm so dumb.

1604
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:32,800
Don't torture yourself.
You were the greatest.

1605
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:34,300
You saved me.

1606
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:37,000
Why are you dressed?

1607
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:39,000
She was blackmailing you,
wasn't she?

1608
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,900
What?

1609
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,700
You know, sometimes you hear
an alarm bell go off in your head.

1610
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:46,600
You don't know what it is
or why it's there.

1611
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:49,800
It's like a radio station
you just can't quite get.

1612
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:51,300
What are you talking about?

1613
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:01,400
I've got to hand it to you.
This was a brilliant plan.

1614
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,800
And then I saw this photo.

1615
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:05,900
Bingo, there it is.

1616
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:07,500
That hand.

1617
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,600
I mean, who could
really forget that hand?

1618
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:13,200
That's Taieesha's hand.
Taieesha didn't die of an overdose.

1619
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:15,000
There was no Taieesha.

1620
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:16,800
Doris Ruth Owens

1621
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:20,400
was the girl you hired
from Buffalo to be Taieesha.

1622
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:25,700
Your award-winning documentary
was a complete phony.

1623
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:28,900
- Ella...
- She was blackmailing you, wasn't she?

1624
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,300
She followed you up here from Buffalo
and she was blackmailing you.

1625
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:36,200
She was going to expose the fact that
your precious career was a total lie.

1626
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:38,400
So you had to stop her.

1627
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:40,500
I love you and you love me.

1628
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:43,600
Everything was a lie.
Your entire career was a lie.

1629
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:46,600
You killed Doris Ruth Owens

1630
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:48,800
because she was threatening
to expose your lie.

1631
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:52,400
You are a lie.
How can I love a lie?

1632
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,700
What was I supposed to do?
Just let her bleed me to death?

1633
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,300
Ruin my whole life?

1634
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,600
What choice did I have?
You tell me.

1635
01:37:58,700 --> 01:38:01,700
You're worth more than her?
Just like that?

1636
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,400
No. No, it's not like that.

1637
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:14,400
You don't have to do this.

1638
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:19,400
Look, Hunter put 17 people in prison
for crimes they may not have committed.

1639
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,600
Are you telling me that she's worth
more than all those people?

1640
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,300
She's worth more
than the whole system?

1641
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:26,400
It was a brilliant plan.
You commit the perfect murder,

1642
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:29,300
you expose Hunter,
you win whatever awards you want to,

1643
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:31,200
you get to become a star.

1644
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:34,300
And after you're acquitted they can't try
you again because of double jeopardy.

1645
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:36,200
We can go so far together.

1646
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:39,000
There's just one
little glitch in your plan.

1647
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,700
You weren't acquitted.
They declared a mistrial.

1648
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:44,000
So once they make the connection
between you and Owens

1649
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:45,800
they'll have enough
evidence to convict you.

1650
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:48,200
- This doesn't have to happen.
- Oh, yes it does.

1651
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:49,900
Why?

1652
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:53,900
Because it's too late.

1653
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:05,500
Ella, what have you done?

1654
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:09,700
What have you done!?

1655
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:12,000
I really don't have anything more
to say to you.

1656
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:20,300
You know, I just thought
of one more thing:

1657
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:30,000
Fuck you.
