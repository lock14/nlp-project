The ghost will come out of the TV and get hold of you or what?



Pussy



Hey, Does this  look like a house to you?



As if you are studying to be a professional ghost hunter



all around ghost books, ghost Dvds,ghost programs



I sometimes find myself seething with doubts if am in love with the devil itself



I've told you countless number of times i aint doin all these for time pass



They are research for the novel am writing



Keep repeating the same excuse over and over



So much for a dumb novel that you are writing..



Hey



Someday my novel is going to get published and grab all the awards thats at stake.Just wait and see



Am seriously asking you



Whatever we watch on TV is true eh?



You think its not?



You think its the truth?



A ghost will come and walk befor your eyes or what?



Its possible



It can.i've seen it myself.



Where?



In my first year,



My hostel mate



There was a girl by the name, Deepa



We were gossiping untill 4 in the morning



Before she left for her room



I went to my room and dozed off



When we got up in the morning, shw wasnt alive.



suicide



Have you ever seen someone hanging by the neck?



No



The tongue will be hanging out till here



After that i couldnt sleep at night



all of a sudden i'd hear her voices



Like she's close by me



Like she's touching me



i'd feel like someone was always there in my room



one day night i woke up all of a sudden



To see her



on my bed



near my legs



Her! It was Her



She was right there and looking at me



She was telling me something



I quickly turned on the lights



to find no one in the room



hey



You aint getting scared are you?



No no. go on



The college itself was talking about that only for a few days



After that, i was not able to stay at that hostel at all



Changing different rooms



And here i am in this house, 2 years from then



without any problems



have you seen her after that?



mmm



i've seen her



but



i got used to it



the creepiness disappeared paving the way for interest



i once even tried talking to her



But



She didnt talk back



why?



Even now she could be in this very room



She could be sitting closeby and listening in to whatever we are talking



actually if something like this happens to someone close to us,
thoughts such as these would often come and go



you are using them and exagger



These are not mere thoughts



They do exist



Did you know that in chennai alone there are 100-200 people commiting suicide every year?



How many of them are dying in accidents?



What became of them?



Even recently they showed in idhayam program about a building in chennai where ghosts are apparently on the loose



saw that?



Two years back the death of two policemen at the entrance of the same house remains a mystery till date



Where is that building by the way?



why?



to feel freaked out everytime you pass by that side eh?



Like you've told me very less now



you're so freaked out just hearing about it



what will you do should you witness it?



Stuff like these, rather than witnessing it for real



it is even more scary when people like you have to narrate it



Honestly, these devils, ghosts exist eh?



For everyone, there will come a moment in life



a moment that makes the unbelievable, believable



if something like that happens to you, you will also believe



thu



Baby



Your moment is waiting



Whose that?



He looks like a mad man?



yeah, i saw. i dont know.



for the past 15 mins he's been flipping through the pages of the notebook



doesnt look to me like someone whose come to have pizza



you think he's going to break-in?



go ask him?



What if all of a sudden he starts biting?



you and your fantasies

Then if sir sees he will shout at us only



Just come boss



Whom are you looking for?



Who the hell do you want?

she was slso pregnant apparently



even whe we got hold of him today,

like a mad-man



he started blabbering, hitting us

register a complaint with the police also



asking them to find her

make sure they dont drag us into the enquiry



make him stay at your room itself



for a few days



Dont leave him anywhere alone



come in

breath



take a deep breath

2 months sir



2 months only eh?



did you try at her mom's place?



she has no parents sir



these days i get atleast 4 wife-running away cases every month



put a sign here



what happened is?



a guy who was suspicious over his wife,



killed her



shot their child also



and commited suicide



that has been locked since



those people near the house



they believe that there are ghosts in there



even two years back



2 policemen were found dead there



till date no one knows how they died



the case is still open in the police department



these are the details of the house

the watchman of this house was a total drunkard sir



he only rented out the outhouse to them



Micheal brother only used to come and go often



the girl..



i've hardly seen her



both of them grew up in an orphanage in madurai



when i asked him,



he said they left the ashram 5 years back



it seems nobody in the ashram knew about the marriage either



i enquired in the college



it seems she came 2 months back to get her arrears application



after that there's been no contact from her side



nothing's clear here



if we dont any clues



the way we enquire itself will be radically different



what if he himself had killed and buried her?



he's not that kind of a person sir



huh? there are people who even kill infants!



anu wouldnt have gone anywhere



we'll sure find her



you first get out of that room, outside



stupid thoughts'll come to you should you keep to yourself



First



you've to come for work



then only you will have some sort of diversion



brother? brother..



what?



inside



something black



some figure



what are you talking about?



inside



no one's in here



go



go



the other day



i went for this kottiyokam delivery remember?



around 10.30



then



there was some sudden breeze



like something went inside me



some sort of bad smell



i...



just freaked out



can you please



send pandi out on late nights?



you're okay right?



brother?



see if there's any bleeding here?



there's nothing there



this side?



seriously there's nothing



nothing ah?



all of a sudden he freaks out



He cries thinking about the girl



he's asking to check if there's blood in his back and all



its so hard for me to see him suffering in the room uncle



that..



any news on the girl?



but



when we were packing at his place,



there was no trace of a girl having lived there



what?



yeah



how much longer?



do you want us to clear the body or not?



Dont come nearby



Move, move, move



what?



know her?



no sir



ok ok clear the place



all of you leave the place, leave leave



dont cry



its not her right?



you've intentionally or unintentionally done something bad to the kid, nithya



her spirit only



is seeking a blood-thirsty revenge over you



whatever happened till date



whatever's happening now



its all her actions,her game



she is trying to make you, come to her place,with her game



with god's grace



we should put this ghost down in the right way



or bad events such as these wont stop occuring



Not just that



even murder might take place



if you agreed to it



there's a malayalee sorceror i know



he's a specialist in controlling ghosts



we'll invite him and



do a pooja this full moon



the order came from thist area only



but he never went to the house from which the order came



like he said, his bike was outside this house only



so, like he says,



the bag must be in here only



shall we go inside and just take it?



it feels creepy only



but what do we do now?



it already has killed 2



dont be hasty



if its there,it'll be inside only right?



the sorcerer's coming from kerala



we'll do a pooja at full moon



and go inside with their help



he's not troubled by ghosts all



but it aint looking like he's lying either



but



he's seen something



and has become terribly scared



he keeps talking about a girl, anu



if that girl is not found,



it is very hard to get him back to normalcy



the girl,anu



does she really exist?



have any of you seen her?



why sir?



it is possible that the girl's an imagination



could be a ghost also



brother?



sit down



how are you?



am fine sir



what, delivery eh?



yes sir



you are able to go and come back these days without feeling scared?



am able to sir



but i dont go anywhere after 8 sir



the other day when i was walking down the road



there was a sort of breeze



like something got into me



some weird smell



here



Prashadam



here



keep this under your pillow



pray to the amman and sleep



your fears will all run away



very powerful
