1
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:48,120
He lost to Harold Johnson
and to Nino Valdez.

2
00:00:48,203 --> 00:00:53,167
That win to Valdez catapulted him
into the national statistics spotlight also.

3
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:57,546
Charles, 32 years old, Satterfield, 30.

4
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,715
Here's round two.

5
00:01:00,716 --> 00:01:04,470
189 for Charles, 180 for Satterfield.

6
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:07,807
Charles is in the white trunks.

7
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:13,772
A writer, like a boxer, must stand alone.

8
00:01:13,855 --> 00:01:17,401
Satterfield has
surprised all tonight with his right.

9
00:01:17,484 --> 00:01:20,654
Having your words published,
like entering a ring...

10
00:01:20,696 --> 00:01:24,200
puts your talent on display.

11
00:01:24,283 --> 00:01:27,203
And there's nowhere to hide.

12
00:01:27,244 --> 00:01:29,664
The truth is revealed.

13
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,460
And sometimes,
the results can be disastrous.

14
00:01:36,337 --> 00:01:38,965
And Satterfield is down.!

15
00:01:40,258 --> 00:01:43,428
Three, four, five, six, seven...

16
00:01:43,512 --> 00:01:48,058
He's not gonna get up. Eight, nine-
And it's all over. Wow.!

17
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:50,060
Ezzard Charles...

18
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:06,870
Oh!

19
00:02:06,953 --> 00:02:11,041
One, two, three...

20
00:02:11,124 --> 00:02:13,752
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

21
00:02:13,836 --> 00:02:14,878
Box!

22
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,821
One, two, three, four...

23
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:42,157
- five, six-
- Over!

24
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:45,619
- Whoo!
- Seven, eight, nine, 10.

25
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:48,456
It's over!

26
00:02:53,252 --> 00:02:55,755
Yo, Erik,
was that a left or a right there?

27
00:02:56,756 --> 00:02:58,675
Erik?

28
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:09,603
There he is, just like I told you.

29
00:03:09,686 --> 00:03:11,647
Come on, guys. Give it a rest.

30
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:14,650
- Come on. We're just messin' around.
- Leave the poor guy alone.

31
00:03:15,651 --> 00:03:16,652
Hey, Champ!

32
00:03:19,822 --> 00:03:22,784
What's up? How you doin', Champ?

33
00:03:22,825 --> 00:03:26,997
Oh, you know, about 60%.
Tryin' to get a bite.

34
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,457
I told my friends you were the Champ.

35
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:34,129
- Yeah, that's right.
- I told 'em I kicked the shit out of you.

36
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:37,633
Kicked the shit right out of me.
Sure did.

37
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,510
- He ain't no champ, Kenny.
- Yeah, I am.!

38
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:43,014
Battlin' Bob Satterfield.
Number three in the world.

39
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:46,392
- Show 'em your moves.
- Oh, no, I'm shoppin'.

40
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,645
You can shop later.

41
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,315
Come on, Champ.!

42
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,693
- Come on.
- Hey, let's go, Champ.!

43
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,654
Come on. Show us your punch.

44
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,868
Let's have some fun!

45
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:06,205
- Wanna see some moves, huh?
- Yeah, show us what you got.

46
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:08,999
Show us your punch.

47
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,376
- Wanna see my punch?
- Yeah.

48
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,753
Aah!

49
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:15,715
What is your problem, old man? Shut up.

50
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:17,884
Dude, is that how you broke
that guy's nose?

51
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:20,428
Yeah, yeah. Boom!
Made the Rock bleed. Yeah, that's right.

52
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,724
Come on, get up, Champ.

53
00:04:24,808 --> 00:04:27,227
- Come on, Champ.!
- I don't want to fight anymore, okay?

54
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:29,229
- Get up, Champ.!
- No. I'm done fightin'.

55
00:04:29,313 --> 00:04:31,231
Come on, Champ. One more round.

56
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,908
Oh!

57
00:04:40,992 --> 00:04:43,453
Come on. Get up, Champ.

58
00:04:43,536 --> 00:04:45,038
- Put your hands up.
- No.

59
00:04:45,121 --> 00:04:46,956
- Put 'em up!
- Fight back, Champ!

60
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,876
Do it, man.!

61
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:54,089
Kenny, the old man's beatin'you.!

62
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:56,884
- Grab him!
- No, no, wait! No, no!

63
00:04:56,925 --> 00:04:59,887
I'm sorry.!
I- I didn't mean it, okay?

64
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:02,056
Right to the midsection!

65
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:04,600
Are you asleep?

66
00:05:04,642 --> 00:05:07,895
I'm sorry.
I, um-What time is it?

67
00:05:07,937 --> 00:05:11,190
All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

68
00:05:11,274 --> 00:05:14,235
Go back to sleep. All right, sweetie. Bye.

69
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,280
Hey.

70
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:19,282
Hey, what's goin' on?

71
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:21,284
Just some assholes having fun.

72
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:22,911
Do it again!

73
00:05:22,995 --> 00:05:25,080
Hey!

74
00:05:25,122 --> 00:05:28,250
- Yeah! New champ now.
- Hey! What the hell?

75
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:30,711
I just beat the champion of the world!

76
00:05:30,795 --> 00:05:32,755
And he's down for the count.!

77
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:36,092
- You guys are such assholes.
- Get in the back.! Come on.!

78
00:05:37,427 --> 00:05:40,472
Yeah.! Hell, yeah.!

79
00:05:40,555 --> 00:05:44,434
Hey. Hey...

80
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:50,440
Old man, are you-Are you okay?

81
00:05:50,482 --> 00:05:54,945
Boys just havin' fun.
You know, it's fun to beat the Champ.

82
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:58,449
Well, you sh...

83
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:02,370
Yeah, you should, uh-
You should get home.

84
00:06:02,453 --> 00:06:05,456
No, I am home.

85
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:11,129
You-You say you're the Champ?
What are you talking about?

86
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:15,300
Yeah, yeah.
Battlin'Bob Satterfield.

87
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:18,637
Number three in the world.

88
00:06:20,472 --> 00:06:22,433
Hey.

89
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:26,979
How 'bout, uh-
Can I give you this?

90
00:06:27,063 --> 00:06:30,316
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

91
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,778
You done helped the Champ
when he was down and halfway out.

92
00:06:33,862 --> 00:06:36,364
I won't forget this.

93
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:39,367
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah, man.

94
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:41,536
I'm about 30% right now,
but I'll be okay.

95
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:48,585
Okay, well, you take care
of yourself, all right?

96
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:51,172
Yeah. You too.

97
00:06:55,593 --> 00:06:57,553
- John, how are you doing?
- Erik.

98
00:07:03,226 --> 00:07:05,186
Denver Times.

99
00:07:11,693 --> 00:07:14,905
All right, well, there's some weirdness
with the smoking ordinance at the casinos.

100
00:07:14,989 --> 00:07:17,116
Um, just some of the employees there...

101
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,368
I'm sorry. That may be a good
opportunity for an editorial.

102
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:23,206
The Indian gaming laws
and the responsibilities and so on.

103
00:07:23,247 --> 00:07:26,084
And while we're on the subject, Ralph,
you know, if you don't mind...

104
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:29,170
I was thinking that maybe we could,
um, assign one of my guys maybe...

105
00:07:29,254 --> 00:07:32,382
to do something about the NFL draft,
the politics involved and...

106
00:07:32,424 --> 00:07:34,426
No, that's good. I like that.
Then, um...

107
00:07:34,468 --> 00:07:37,429
And then my sports guys can do
an editorial on global warming.

108
00:07:37,512 --> 00:07:39,890
- Oh, come on. This is serious.
- No, I mean it.

109
00:07:39,932 --> 00:07:43,978
Guys, guys. You're up, Jo.

110
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:48,649
Well, the mayor's coming out in favor
of the, um, convention coming here.

111
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:51,569
So, um-So there's gonna be
a press conference later.

112
00:07:51,611 --> 00:07:55,490
Well, that's that.
Lunch is on me at Duffy's.

113
00:07:55,573 --> 00:08:00,036
- Anyone that can bring me a completed crossword.
- Awesome.! Love Duffy's.

114
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,289
Are we sending anybody down
to training camp?

115
00:08:02,372 --> 00:08:04,625
I have a budget for a stringer, I guess.

116
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,920
- Well, I think it might be nice to do a draft follow-up.
- Yeah, sure.

117
00:08:08,003 --> 00:08:09,964
Good.

118
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:12,424
Hey, boss.
We got a little buried today, huh?

119
00:08:12,466 --> 00:08:16,304
- What are you talking about?
- The Jermaine fight I covered.

120
00:08:16,387 --> 00:08:20,642
- It was a good fight.
- Oh, yeah. I buried it, right.

121
00:08:20,725 --> 00:08:23,645
- Why?
- Something's got to get buried.

122
00:08:23,728 --> 00:08:25,772
Well, that's what high school wrestling
is for, right?

123
00:08:25,814 --> 00:08:28,692
I mean, it's a solid story.
Not a fact missing.

124
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:30,694
You had copy 40 minutes after the fight.

125
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:35,366
Yeah, you're like a machine.
All the style of one too.

126
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:37,284
- Wait a minute, Ralph.
- Do you mind sitting?

127
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,127
Now, listen. I appreciate
what you're doing, filling my pages.

128
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,212
And I don't want you to stop.

129
00:08:48,296 --> 00:08:51,299
Hey, Ralph? Sorry for interrupting.
Do you want me to e-mail you those quotes?

130
00:08:51,341 --> 00:08:55,887
Yeah, yeah, right.
But your copy, it's unimpressive.

131
00:08:56,888 --> 00:08:58,849
A lot of typing, not much writing.

132
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:03,812
- Well, Sam Kirby liked-
- He doesn't work here anymore.

133
00:09:05,314 --> 00:09:10,987
The truth is... I forget your pieces
while I'm reading them.

134
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,740
Now, if this is the best you can do,
I'm not gonna complain.

135
00:09:14,782 --> 00:09:16,701
But I know you can do a lot better.

136
00:09:18,203 --> 00:09:20,163
- Why is that, Ralph?
- Because of your name.

137
00:09:21,831 --> 00:09:23,750
- Thanks for the talk.
- Oh, look, come on.

138
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:27,838
Look. Don't get like a chick on me,
all right? Be a man.

139
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:32,176
Recognize your weaknesses and fix 'em.

140
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:36,097
Slow down a bit, you know?
Think quality.

141
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:39,767
I got it. Got an appointment.

142
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,438
We write it like this.

143
00:09:43,521 --> 00:09:46,107
What the lawsuit is calling for
is an order to force the E.P. A...

144
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:48,235
to reassign its approval
over the water standards...

145
00:09:48,318 --> 00:09:50,737
for the rivers
affected by the development.

146
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:54,575
Mm-hmm. Wyoming and Montana
are going to join as interveners.

147
00:09:54,658 --> 00:09:56,577
Okay.

148
00:09:57,995 --> 00:10:00,456
- Hey, was that you calling last night?
- Yeah, yeah, it was.

149
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:02,792
Sorry about that.

150
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,795
Hey, did you read the article-
Jermaine fight?

151
00:10:05,878 --> 00:10:07,797
Yeah. It was good.

152
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,799
- It was, wasn't it?
- Very solid.

153
00:10:09,882 --> 00:10:12,635
Yeah, solid. Exactly.
Metz hated it. Of course.

154
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:14,220
What didn't he like?

155
00:10:15,764 --> 00:10:18,225
What does Metz...

156
00:10:18,308 --> 00:10:21,979
What does Metz ever like?
I don't know. He wasn't specific.

157
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:25,232
You know,
he's never going to let me write...

158
00:10:25,274 --> 00:10:27,276
on the Broncos or the Nuggets.

159
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:29,987
Well, maybe Metz will come around.

160
00:10:30,071 --> 00:10:35,743
It doesn't really matter because,
um, I'm having lunch with Whitley.

161
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:37,328
Today.

162
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:39,748
I might have a shot at the magazine.

163
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:42,500
- That's great.
- Yeah, it is.

164
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:45,337
- That is great.
- Nothing certain yet, but it seems pretty positive.

165
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,339
- That's fantastic.
- Yep.

166
00:10:47,422 --> 00:10:49,091
Does Metz know?

167
00:10:49,174 --> 00:10:52,928
Are you serious?
What are you on?

168
00:10:53,012 --> 00:10:54,972
No, Metz doesn't know.

169
00:10:59,227 --> 00:11:02,730
Hey, I was wondering if I could shoot
some hoops with Teddy this afternoon.

170
00:11:02,814 --> 00:11:04,732
You know,
Teddy's only gonna get used to this...

171
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:06,776
if we stick on the schedule
that we agreed on.

172
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,154
We're separated, okay?

173
00:11:09,237 --> 00:11:13,492
It's easy for you to say. You haven't
had your son cleaved from you.

174
00:11:15,577 --> 00:11:18,497
All right, all right.
A little overdramatic. Sorry.

175
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,624
Sorry, I'm just...

176
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,961
Ball's in the play box in the garage.

177
00:11:24,045 --> 00:11:27,215
Thank you. Thank you.

178
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:30,426
- Talk to Metz.
- Sure.

179
00:11:31,219 --> 00:11:34,681
So, um, listen, I was, uh- I was sorry
to hear about your old man.

180
00:11:34,764 --> 00:11:37,517
Mmm. Thank you.

181
00:11:37,601 --> 00:11:40,270
It was cancer, right?

182
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:43,482
Yeah. Uh, here.

183
00:11:43,524 --> 00:11:45,150
Hmm. Of all places.

184
00:11:45,192 --> 00:11:49,488
- Ironic, right?
- Yeah. We got the iced teas coming?

185
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,490
- Mm-hmm, sure.
- Thank you.

186
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:54,535
Look, we've read your stuff,
Fred Roselle and I.

187
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:56,746
And I'm sorry to say,
it's just not there.

188
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:59,666
Not yet anyway.

189
00:11:59,707 --> 00:12:02,377
The consensus
was that it lacked personality.

190
00:12:03,628 --> 00:12:05,672
Exactly.

191
00:12:05,755 --> 00:12:11,345
I mean, Bing, last year, under Kirby,
I had 192 bylines.

192
00:12:11,386 --> 00:12:14,932
That's the most of any reporter
in the history of the newspaper.

193
00:12:15,015 --> 00:12:17,351
You say my stuff is thin?
Of course it is.

194
00:12:17,393 --> 00:12:19,604
A lot of typing, no writing.
I don't have time.

195
00:12:19,687 --> 00:12:24,025
And this year, I have a new editor.
So I keep an open mind.

196
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:27,445
And guess what? He's working me
even harder than Kirby was.

197
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:31,199
I mean, he thinks I'm a machine.

198
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:37,206
Anytime I bring in a story with just
an ounce of heart, Metz spikes it.

199
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:41,418
I mean, this is stuff that I think that
the magazine should have- magazine deserves.

200
00:12:41,502 --> 00:12:44,380
- Okay, give me an example.
- Well...

201
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:47,091
- Is that the mango?
- Yeah.

202
00:12:47,174 --> 00:12:49,552
- It's not the peach?
- No, it's the mango.

203
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:51,929
Sorry. I'm sorry.
Give me an example.

204
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:54,849
I mean, there's- I have so many.
But sometimes I feel blocked.

205
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:58,144
- I'm not very good at this.
- No, no, no. Just anything. Just give me an example.

206
00:12:58,228 --> 00:13:02,983
Um, crossroads. Uh, Elway.

207
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:05,819
You know, what does he do now
at this point in his life?

208
00:13:05,903 --> 00:13:08,781
- Maybe he runs for governor.
- I get that one proposed and rejected twice a week.

209
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,783
People don't want to hear
about their heroes aging.

210
00:13:10,825 --> 00:13:13,119
Okay, okay.
Well, then what about Coors Field?

211
00:13:13,202 --> 00:13:16,330
- The worst place to pitch-
- The worst place to pitch in America.

212
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:20,710
Uh, strikin' out.

213
00:13:20,793 --> 00:13:23,880
Um...

214
00:13:23,963 --> 00:13:29,261
Well, there's this boxer.
An ex-heavyweight contender.

215
00:13:29,302 --> 00:13:31,597
He's, uh, living on the streets of Denver.

216
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,767
- He's living in the trash.
- Yeah?

217
00:13:34,808 --> 00:13:37,937
Yeah. And, you know, he kind of patrols
the neighborhood. He calls himself the Champ.

218
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,524
He's a- He's a lovely guy.

219
00:13:41,607 --> 00:13:47,155
And the story, it's beautiful.
It's touching.

220
00:13:47,238 --> 00:13:49,657
But I tell Metz about it,
and he says, "Forget about it.

221
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:52,202
It's a dry hole.
Go cover the Jermaine fight."

222
00:13:52,285 --> 00:13:55,247
What's his name, the, uh- the boxer?

223
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,332
Satterfield.

224
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:01,920
Bob Satterfield?

225
00:14:02,004 --> 00:14:05,633
- Yeah. Bob.
- Wow.

226
00:14:05,674 --> 00:14:09,846
Are you sure? My dad used to idolize that guy.
I thought he was dead.

227
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:12,765
- He- No, he's dead.
- That's what everybody thinks.

228
00:14:12,849 --> 00:14:16,394
And that's why I think that this story
is such a great story.

229
00:14:16,478 --> 00:14:19,439
I want to call it
"Resurrecting the Champ."

230
00:14:19,522 --> 00:14:22,818
- And he's here in Denver?
- Yeah.

231
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:25,654
- Bob Satterfield?
- I saw him yesterday.

232
00:14:27,322 --> 00:14:29,783
What are your plans for this?

233
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:31,952
Well, I thought maybe
I'd take my time.

234
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:36,374
You know, really work well on it,
work hard. Think quality.

235
00:14:36,457 --> 00:14:39,168
And see if I can get Metz
to come around.

236
00:14:39,252 --> 00:14:41,713
Well, if, uh...

237
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:46,593
If you can't bring him around,
I'd be glad to take a look at it.

238
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:51,890
Well, that'd be great.
That'd be terrific.

239
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,184
When he won in California,
it was already too late.

240
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,228
Mondale had already
had enough delegates.

241
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,480
Um, no, I think so.

242
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,859
Uh, November 30-
I don't have an exact date. I can find one.

243
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,903
- Hey.
- One second. Okay.

244
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:07,031
No, I'll get it for you and I'll-
Okay. Bye.

245
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,033
- Hey.
- Hey. How's it goin'?

246
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,953
- Great.
- Can you keep a secret, Molly?

247
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,662
- Can you?
- Sure.

248
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,123
- Can you?
- Sure.

249
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:17,626
My name's not Molly.

250
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,922
Yes, that's true.
'Cause it's Millie, right?

251
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,507
- Polly.
- Polly.

252
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,385
Close. Yeah.
What can I do for you?

253
00:15:26,469 --> 00:15:31,849
Uh, well, I'm doing
a story on a heavyweight fighter...

254
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:34,102
from the 1950s named Bob Satterfield.

255
00:15:34,185 --> 00:15:36,604
But, um, nobody can know about it.

256
00:15:36,688 --> 00:15:39,441
You're moonlighting.
It's none of Metz's business.

257
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:42,819
- You got it.
- Yeah.

258
00:15:42,903 --> 00:15:45,781
What do you need?

259
00:15:45,864 --> 00:15:48,909
Well, um, there wasn't much on him
on the Internet.

260
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:52,538
So I guess you're gonna have to
go old school on this one.

261
00:15:52,621 --> 00:15:55,458
I kind of need everything
you can find on him.

262
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:59,796
From our library, New York Times,
L.A. Times, Ring magazine, of course.

263
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:02,799
If you can find out if there's
a Boxing Hall of Fame, that'd be great.

264
00:16:02,882 --> 00:16:07,971
Anybody he may have fought.
Uh, trainers, anything.

265
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:09,973
Shouldn't you write this down
or something?

266
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:12,100
Plausible deniability.

267
00:16:12,142 --> 00:16:14,478
I've got to take that.

268
00:16:14,561 --> 00:16:17,314
- I will get the information and bring it to your cubicle.
- Okay.

269
00:16:17,398 --> 00:16:20,025
Let's go. Drive it in.
Take it into the hoop.

270
00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:23,529
I'm a big ol' slow guy. You can't take it
inside on me. You can't do it!

271
00:16:23,613 --> 00:16:25,948
- Foul!
- Foul?

272
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,534
Okay. Take some free throws then.

273
00:16:28,618 --> 00:16:32,455
Aim for my hand, all right?
Front of the rim, my hand.

274
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:34,374
Get it up there.

275
00:16:34,457 --> 00:16:37,544
You gotta roll it off
the ends of your fingers, okay?

276
00:16:37,627 --> 00:16:40,839
- I suck.
- You don't suck.

277
00:16:40,923 --> 00:16:43,133
You think Shaq was hittin' baskets
when he was your age?

278
00:16:43,175 --> 00:16:45,344
- Yeah.
- Well, he wasn't.

279
00:16:45,427 --> 00:16:47,721
He told me so himself.

280
00:16:47,805 --> 00:16:50,808
He said that he was a big ol' spaz
when he was your age.

281
00:16:50,891 --> 00:16:53,895
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

282
00:16:53,978 --> 00:16:57,524
But he told me that in confidence, buddy.
So you can't tell anybody, okay?

283
00:16:57,607 --> 00:16:59,818
- Dad?
- Yes?

284
00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:02,863
Have you called up John Elway yet
and asked if he's playing next year?

285
00:17:04,322 --> 00:17:06,283
You know, we keep missing
each other, buddy.

286
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:09,995
I hope he comes back.
The Broncos need him.

287
00:17:10,037 --> 00:17:15,501
You know, I told him that you said that.
And he said he'd consider it.

288
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:17,628
- Really?
- Really.

289
00:17:17,712 --> 00:17:19,922
So if he comes back,
you're partially responsible.

290
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:24,594
Are you gonna stay for dinner tonight?
Mom's making spaghetti and meatballs.

291
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:27,639
Would you like me to?

292
00:17:27,722 --> 00:17:30,308
Hi, sweetie. Hey, Erik.

293
00:17:30,392 --> 00:17:33,562
So, Teddy was just inviting me to stay
for spaghetti and meatballs.

294
00:17:35,063 --> 00:17:36,982
What do you think?

295
00:17:37,065 --> 00:17:39,526
- How'd it go with Whitley today?
- We'll talk about it later.

296
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,655
Are you gonna make more money
at the magazine?

297
00:17:42,738 --> 00:17:46,117
Mmm, no. But that's not
really the point, buddy.

298
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,119
It's about the prestige.

299
00:17:48,202 --> 00:17:53,249
And I'd probably have to write
maybe 15 articles a year. Maybe.

300
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,544
- That's a lot of stories.
- Actually, it's not.

301
00:17:56,586 --> 00:17:58,713
It's only about one
every three and a half weeks.

302
00:17:58,755 --> 00:18:01,717
That means I can really concentrate on them,
make them good.

303
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:05,721
Then maybe I can become
as respected as your mom.

304
00:18:05,763 --> 00:18:09,767
It could be like a ticket
to the big time kind of thing.

305
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,644
Los Angeles Times, New York Times.

306
00:18:11,727 --> 00:18:14,105
Like the story on the boxer
that you pitched to Whitley?

307
00:18:14,188 --> 00:18:16,774
Exactly.

308
00:18:16,858 --> 00:18:21,071
In fact, I better get back to the alley,
see if he's still sleeping there.

309
00:18:21,112 --> 00:18:23,949
There's a man sleeping in the alley?

310
00:18:24,032 --> 00:18:27,077
Yeah, buddy. Some people do that.
They don't have a home.

311
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,915
Or friends or family.
They gotta sleep in the alley.

312
00:18:31,957 --> 00:18:34,251
This sounds like
it's gonna be a very sad story.

313
00:18:35,794 --> 00:18:39,006
No, buddy. It's gonna be a hopeful story.
Don't worry.

314
00:18:40,424 --> 00:18:43,261
Who's coming to Career Day, you or Mom?

315
00:18:43,344 --> 00:18:46,097
Well, I'm sure your friends
would rather hear about...

316
00:18:46,139 --> 00:18:48,683
your dad's work as a sportswriter...

317
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:50,602
than my conversations...

318
00:18:50,685 --> 00:18:54,982
with Herb... Milton.

319
00:18:55,065 --> 00:18:57,234
He's the city mass transit accountant.

320
00:18:57,317 --> 00:18:59,778
That was awesome.
I'm gonna go find Satterfield.

321
00:18:59,862 --> 00:19:03,324
Your mom and I will talk about who's
coming to Career Day. Okay, buddy?

322
00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:06,702
I love you. See you, buddy.

323
00:19:06,786 --> 00:19:09,038
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

324
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:31,395
- Good evening,
all you boys and some girls.

325
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:33,814
This is Erik "The Wow Man"Kernan.

326
00:19:33,898 --> 00:19:36,651
And, wow, was there a fight tonight.!

327
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:40,738
In the hot, stale air of Las Vegas,
it was a three-round affair...

328
00:19:40,822 --> 00:19:44,492
that carried the weight of war and sin
on its head and shoulders.

329
00:19:44,576 --> 00:19:46,912
There was a winner. That's for sure.

330
00:20:00,968 --> 00:20:04,680
Jesus Christ!

331
00:20:06,349 --> 00:20:11,187
You're Champ, right?
Your last name is Satterfield?

332
00:20:11,229 --> 00:20:14,191
Yeah. Battlin' Bob Satterfield,
number three in the world.

333
00:20:14,232 --> 00:20:16,276
Right. Okay.

334
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,571
- You told me that last night.
- Last night.

335
00:20:19,655 --> 00:20:23,868
Yeah, you- Those, um, kids
came in here, and they were...

336
00:20:23,951 --> 00:20:25,995
Oh, yeah, yeah! Yeah.

337
00:20:26,078 --> 00:20:28,581
You done helped Champ
when he was down and halfway out.

338
00:20:28,664 --> 00:20:32,585
Yeah. I'm Erik Kernan
of The Denver Times.

339
00:20:32,627 --> 00:20:35,046
I was wondering
if I could buy you a cup of coffee.

340
00:20:35,088 --> 00:20:38,550
I don't drink coffee.
I used to. But not no more.

341
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:41,970
Uh, how about a cold beer?

342
00:20:42,053 --> 00:20:46,725
Yeah, I indulge in a beer
every now and then.

343
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,729
I think people would love your story.

344
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:54,608
I mean, you were-
You were almost champion of the world.

345
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:56,736
Ah, that was a long time ago.

346
00:20:56,777 --> 00:21:00,615
You fought LaMotta.
You fought Patterson.

347
00:21:00,698 --> 00:21:05,078
You heard a whole stadium of people
stand up and call out your name.

348
00:21:07,956 --> 00:21:10,792
- You remember that?
- Sure. Sure, I remember.

349
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:14,338
People would know you.

350
00:21:14,421 --> 00:21:17,591
You could walk down the street,
everybody would know your name.

351
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:20,344
So, what you gonna write about?

352
00:21:20,428 --> 00:21:23,431
I'm gonna write
what you tell me, your story.

353
00:21:28,102 --> 00:21:32,941
Nah. Everybody already
know my name. I'm Champ.

354
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:39,907
Well, just in case.

355
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:48,749
Kernan. Kernan, like that guy who used to
be on the radio a long time ago.

356
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,877
- Yeah, he was my father.
- You don't say.

357
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,879
I do, yeah.

358
00:21:52,962 --> 00:21:58,343
Your father
ruined Christmas for me one year.

359
00:21:58,426 --> 00:22:03,640
He was on the radio talkin'all about
how I was a disappointment.

360
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:08,061
Christmas Eve, 1953.

361
00:22:09,188 --> 00:22:14,318
I went from up and coming
to a has-been.

362
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:16,362
Nothin' in between.

363
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:21,826
Pissed me off, your daddy did.

364
00:22:23,661 --> 00:22:25,830
Well, let me make it up to you.

365
00:22:25,872 --> 00:22:29,000
I'll come back around,
next day or two.

366
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:31,002
Maybe we can have another beer.

367
00:22:32,296 --> 00:22:34,923
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. All right. Yeah.

368
00:22:35,007 --> 00:22:38,928
Hey! You know,
I ain't gonna forget this.

369
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:42,348
You done helped the Champ
when he was down and damn near out.

370
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,934
I'm trying to find something
we can all listen to.

371
00:22:45,017 --> 00:22:46,936
Well, I can put together a list, I guess.

372
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:50,481
There are a couple bands that are new,
that are good. But they're not too loud.

373
00:22:50,565 --> 00:22:54,277
- Yeah. Not all that acid stuff.
- No, I wouldn't do that to you, I promise.

374
00:22:54,361 --> 00:22:57,197
- Yeah, what?
- Boss. Hey. Miller's out with the flu.

375
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:59,741
Yeah, I know, it's going around.
You oughta get a flu shot.

376
00:22:59,825 --> 00:23:01,743
- I did.
- They're giving 'em out on the second floor.

377
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:04,204
Yeah, I did. I just was wondering
if I could cover for him.

378
00:23:04,246 --> 00:23:06,790
Trailblazers are in town,
and he was supposed to cover the game.

379
00:23:06,874 --> 00:23:10,753
- I'll just put together a list.
- I need those quotes. I need more quotes on the golf story.

380
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:14,382
- Hey, Erik.
- Uh, I was wondering if I could cover for him.

381
00:23:14,465 --> 00:23:16,551
No, no.
Duncan's got the Trailblazers game.

382
00:23:16,634 --> 00:23:18,595
I thought Duncan was covering
the bantamweight fight.

383
00:23:18,636 --> 00:23:22,224
You're gonna take the fight, and he's got
the Trailblazers. I promised him. I'm sorry.

384
00:23:22,307 --> 00:23:24,392
Okay. Yeah. It's just that my kid...

385
00:23:24,476 --> 00:23:27,563
I was gonna take him
because he idolizes the Trailblazers.

386
00:23:27,646 --> 00:23:29,606
They're his heroes.

387
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:35,654
I'm sorry. The Trailblazers,
they're his- they're his heroes?

388
00:23:35,738 --> 00:23:40,409
- Yeah.
- Now I know you're full of shit.

389
00:23:40,493 --> 00:23:44,080
- See you, Ralph.
- You give it away like that. No, really. I know now.

390
00:23:44,247 --> 00:23:46,416
Boom! That's just the way
it happened too.

391
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,669
- I broke not the big bone in his nose, but the small one.
- Damn.

392
00:23:49,753 --> 00:23:51,421
You kicked some ass back in the day.

393
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,799
- That's right. Bob Satterfield,
number three in the world.

394
00:23:53,882 --> 00:23:55,509
Yo, man, I gotta go though.

395
00:23:55,592 --> 00:23:58,011
All right, youngblood.
Take it easy, baby. All right.

396
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:01,807
- Hey, Champ.
- Hey, hey!

397
00:24:01,891 --> 00:24:04,352
You-You scared him off.
He thought you was the police.

398
00:24:04,435 --> 00:24:07,980
- Well, I'm definitely not. You remember who I am?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

399
00:24:08,064 --> 00:24:11,276
You're the guy helped the Champ when he
was down and halfway out. You that reporter.

400
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,864
- I'm honored. How you feelin'?
- Oh, you know, about 60%.

401
00:24:15,947 --> 00:24:18,450
Have you thought at all
about talkin' with me?

402
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:22,496
No, I ain't been thinkin' about nothin'.
I'm savin' that till later.

403
00:24:22,538 --> 00:24:24,498
What are you doin' now?
Are you busy?

404
00:24:31,255 --> 00:24:33,716
Corners.

405
00:24:38,888 --> 00:24:41,015
So I'm sorry
I brought you to a dog, Champ.

406
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:43,643
No, no, no. The white kid?

407
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:46,354
He's gonna knock
the Spanish kid on his ass.

408
00:24:46,438 --> 00:24:48,899
- Don't you mean the other way around?
- Mm-mmm.

409
00:24:48,982 --> 00:24:50,901
Kernan, who's your buddy?

410
00:24:52,945 --> 00:24:56,157
- Tillman, Bob. Bob, Tillman.
- How ya doin', Bob?

411
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,617
Oh, about 90% tonight.

412
00:24:58,701 --> 00:25:01,412
Um, you got any more of those beers?

413
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:06,042
Sure. Have mine. Help yourself.

414
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:08,086
White boy's gonna knock
the spicky kid out.

415
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:11,840
No way.
Gomez is way too strong, man.

416
00:25:25,187 --> 00:25:30,234
One, two, three, four...

417
00:25:30,318 --> 00:25:34,531
five, six, seven, eight...

418
00:25:34,572 --> 00:25:36,700
nine, 10.!

419
00:25:36,783 --> 00:25:40,245
This is over.!

420
00:25:40,287 --> 00:25:43,749
How did you see that coming, Champ?
The knockout, I mean.

421
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:48,337
Oh, oh, well, I, um-
I see the white boy, uh-uh...

422
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,840
- Durant.
- Yeah. I see Durant, he was...

423
00:25:50,923 --> 00:25:53,342
he was, like, takin' that ass-whoopin'.

424
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:55,595
- But-But then I seen his eyes.
- What about his eyes?

425
00:25:55,678 --> 00:26:00,225
Well, he, um- He figured out
that the Spanish fella, he had a tell.

426
00:26:00,266 --> 00:26:05,730
See? A tell. When he switched over
from lefty back to righty.

427
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:09,192
See, I saw his eyes figure out
that the spicky boy...

428
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:12,070
he cocked his head to the left
before he made the switch.

429
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,156
He had that figured-out look
in his eye.

430
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,158
- You saw that?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

431
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,828
I done seen it in my opponents' eyes
way too many times.

432
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:25,251
Ah, don't nobody want to read
about an old man like me.

433
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:29,589
Sure, they do. Most fight fans
think you're dead, Champ.

434
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:32,217
I mean, wait till they hear
what you've been through.

435
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,096
And that you're still around to tell about it?
They'll shit themselves.

436
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,432
You'll be a celebrity again.

437
00:26:51,654 --> 00:26:55,784
Champ, I gotta tell ya.

438
00:26:56,993 --> 00:26:58,954
I'm in real trouble where I work.

439
00:27:00,956 --> 00:27:04,167
I'm just about down and out myself.

440
00:27:05,836 --> 00:27:09,131
I'm havin'a real dry spell at the paper.

441
00:27:09,214 --> 00:27:11,926
They're talkin' about firin' me.

442
00:27:14,512 --> 00:27:18,975
Newspapers are being forced to cut bulk
because of the Internet and all that.

443
00:27:23,688 --> 00:27:25,982
Champ...

444
00:27:27,234 --> 00:27:30,696
this article is my title shot.

445
00:27:41,415 --> 00:27:45,586
All right, son. All right.

446
00:27:47,046 --> 00:27:49,883
You ask the questions. I answer.

447
00:27:51,551 --> 00:27:54,513
Thanks.

448
00:27:56,598 --> 00:27:59,101
See, Rocky Marciano...

449
00:27:59,184 --> 00:28:02,688
he's gettin'ready
for that Jersey Joe Walcott fight.

450
00:28:02,771 --> 00:28:06,400
And Rocky, well, he hired
all the good sparring partners around.

451
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:09,528
And they paid us at that time,
oh, what was it?

452
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,531
Oh, yeah, $50 apiece, I think.

453
00:28:11,572 --> 00:28:14,784
- Come on, Rock!
- It was on a Sunday.

454
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:17,287
We put on an exhibition
at Grossinger's in New York.

455
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,289
Keep your arms up! Keep your arms up!

456
00:28:19,372 --> 00:28:21,750
You're gonna take Jersey Joe down
in the first round!

457
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:25,420
Oh, he was strong, I'm gonna tell ya.

458
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:28,048
Hit me on the glove,
still knock me down.

459
00:28:28,132 --> 00:28:32,970
But not out. See? I got up.
Started fightin'harder.

460
00:28:33,053 --> 00:28:35,806
And I kept hittin'him on the nose
and hittin'him on the nose...

461
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,184
till his nose started bleeding.

462
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:43,731
And every time he come to hit
with that overhand right...

463
00:28:43,815 --> 00:28:46,067
I'd get back
and shoot a short right up to him.

464
00:28:46,151 --> 00:28:49,196
- And-And then his nose wouldn't stop.
- You all right?

465
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,575
Everybody was all concerned and stuff,
but, you know, Rocky was tough as hell.

466
00:28:53,617 --> 00:28:56,328
He came back.!
But I had him.

467
00:28:56,412 --> 00:28:58,372
He's goin'down, Rock. He's goin'down.

468
00:28:58,455 --> 00:29:01,208
Whoo!

469
00:29:01,292 --> 00:29:03,711
That's just the way it happened too.

470
00:29:03,794 --> 00:29:08,508
Now, now, I broke not the big bone in his nose,
but the little bone. Busted it.

471
00:29:08,591 --> 00:29:12,387
Now, I-I-I'm not one
to give my opinion, all right?

472
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:16,933
But every time Rocky fought after that,
his nose bled.

473
00:29:17,017 --> 00:29:21,980
Defended the title six times,
but always had trouble with that nose.

474
00:29:22,064 --> 00:29:23,982
I'm thinkin' that's why he quit.

475
00:29:31,157 --> 00:29:33,951
What about your father?
He must have been proud.

476
00:29:34,035 --> 00:29:37,288
No, no. He used to whoop me.

477
00:29:37,372 --> 00:29:39,332
- Seriously?
- Yeah, yeah.

478
00:29:39,374 --> 00:29:41,835
Look-Look here, see?

479
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,344
- When did he do that?
- Oh, I think I was... nine years old.

480
00:29:53,848 --> 00:29:57,143
What? Your daddy never whoop you?

481
00:29:57,226 --> 00:30:02,190
- No.
- Mmm. Well, you're a lucky man.

482
00:30:35,517 --> 00:30:39,479
Merry Christmas
to all you boys and some girls.

483
00:30:39,563 --> 00:30:43,400
This is Erik "The Wow Man"Kernan
speaking of pugilism...

484
00:30:43,484 --> 00:30:45,944
where tonight, wow...

485
00:30:46,028 --> 00:30:49,198
the art of the sport was reduced
to something less than that...

486
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:53,578
when one Thomas Kincaid entered the ring
with one Bernard Summerville.

487
00:30:53,661 --> 00:30:59,375
As I sat watching the battle from my humble perch
beneath them, one thing became clear.

488
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:03,463
Mr. Kincaid is no longer worthy
to carry the title of heir apparent...

489
00:31:03,546 --> 00:31:06,383
in a world once inhabited
by the greats, by the giants...

490
00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:10,012

491
00:31:10,095 --> 00:31:13,140
This is Erik "The Wow Man"Kernan.

492
00:31:13,223 --> 00:31:15,893
And we'll be right back
after these words.

493
00:31:24,444 --> 00:31:26,404
Nice article.

494
00:31:26,446 --> 00:31:28,907
- Yep. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

495
00:31:33,787 --> 00:31:36,206
Erik Kernan, Denver Times.

496
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,417
Hey, Ken, what's up?

497
00:31:39,877 --> 00:31:44,215
Uh, I gotta call you back, all right?
Just a second. See ya.

498
00:31:44,298 --> 00:31:47,760
- Hey, Ralph.
- Morning. Nice piece.

499
00:31:49,053 --> 00:31:50,972
Yeah? Thanks.

500
00:31:51,055 --> 00:31:53,099
Normally, I'd cut the whole
reading of the eyes bit.

501
00:31:53,183 --> 00:31:55,477
But I don't know.
It smelled authentic.

502
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,562
I'm glad you liked it.

503
00:31:57,646 --> 00:32:01,316
- Aren't you glad you didn't go to that bullshit basketball game?
- Yeah.

504
00:32:22,172 --> 00:32:24,090
- Champ.
- Hey!

505
00:32:25,884 --> 00:32:28,762
- Weren't we supposed to meet?
- Is that right?

506
00:32:28,845 --> 00:32:32,516
Last night. We said we were gonna meet
at the park about an hour ago?

507
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:38,063
W-Well, here we are.

508
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:43,152
That's our piece. Page one.

509
00:32:43,236 --> 00:32:46,489
How about that?
There's spicky boy on his ass.

510
00:32:46,573 --> 00:32:48,575
How 'bout that?

511
00:32:48,658 --> 00:32:53,330
Hey, uh-uh-uh-
How 'bout I buy you lunch?

512
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,332
Yeah.

513
00:32:57,376 --> 00:33:00,129
- Always this many people here, Champ?
- Mm-hmm.

514
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:02,673
- Food always this good?
- Oh, yeah, most times.

515
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:06,093
They do make a fish soup some days,
but you don't want to touch that.

516
00:33:07,637 --> 00:33:10,598
Aren't you afraid someone's
gonna steal your cart?

517
00:33:10,681 --> 00:33:15,270
No. We got this kind of homeless
code of honor, you know?

518
00:33:15,353 --> 00:33:17,856
It's all right.
Nobody's gonna bother it.

519
00:33:17,939 --> 00:33:19,900
You know what would be good
for the story?

520
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:24,029
If I could look at some of the stuff in your cart,
see what you lug around every day.

521
00:33:24,071 --> 00:33:26,698
I think it'd be really interesting
for the article.

522
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,535
All right, we can do that...

523
00:33:29,576 --> 00:33:33,205
as soon as you take me to your house
and let me go through all your personal stuff.

524
00:33:36,209 --> 00:33:39,587
Oh, you know, I listened to my father's tape.
Christmas, 1953.

525
00:33:39,671 --> 00:33:42,048
- Mmm.
- And he didn't mention you.

526
00:33:42,131 --> 00:33:44,926
He didn't talk about you
till about a week later.

527
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:48,388
Well, maybe I got Christmas
and New Year's confused.

528
00:33:48,472 --> 00:33:51,058
Is your daddy still alive?

529
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:54,603
No, he-Throat cancer.

530
00:33:54,686 --> 00:33:57,773
Throat cancer.
Wow. That's, um-That's, uh...

531
00:33:57,857 --> 00:34:00,484
Ironic.

532
00:34:00,568 --> 00:34:06,407
Irony is when something seems like
it's going a certain way, and then...

533
00:34:06,449 --> 00:34:08,952
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know-
I know what irony is, kid.

534
00:34:08,993 --> 00:34:11,746
You know, I-I've had a lot
of experience with irony.

535
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,250
Sorry.

536
00:34:16,752 --> 00:34:18,670
So, you have much formal education?

537
00:34:18,754 --> 00:34:22,925
No, no. Didn't have much schooling.
I was always boxing.

538
00:34:25,052 --> 00:34:27,346
I never dreamed, though,
I'd be heavyweight champ.

539
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:32,101
But I always thought that if I got that shot,
I would like to think that...

540
00:34:32,143 --> 00:34:34,646
that if I got that shot,
that I would win it.

541
00:34:34,729 --> 00:34:37,440
Get that respect.

542
00:34:39,401 --> 00:34:41,695
But you didn't get the chance.

543
00:34:41,778 --> 00:34:43,739
No. No, no. Never did.

544
00:34:46,658 --> 00:34:49,662
I had this fight with Ezzard Charles.
He was makin' a comeback.

545
00:34:49,745 --> 00:34:54,709
If-If I beat him, then I could go
from number three to number one.

546
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:57,378
Then I could get that title.
Get a shot at that belt.

547
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:06,513
But he caught me and somehow
knocked me flat on my back.

548
00:35:07,681 --> 00:35:09,349
Out cold.

549
00:35:09,432 --> 00:35:12,978
That was a- How you say?
It was a...

550
00:35:13,061 --> 00:35:17,149
That was a big humiliation for me.

551
00:35:17,232 --> 00:35:21,028
I had a couple more fights after that.
But I was only about 30%.

552
00:35:21,112 --> 00:35:23,489
Wasn't no need in me carryin' on.

553
00:35:23,572 --> 00:35:27,785
I moved to Sioux City, see?
Up and left my family.

554
00:35:29,162 --> 00:35:31,206
On account of the humiliation?

555
00:35:31,289 --> 00:35:33,917
Yeah, yeah, exactly right.

556
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,336
I worked in the horse stables, uh...

557
00:35:36,378 --> 00:35:40,924
One of the owners, he-he-he found out
who I was, and he had this idea, see?

558
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:43,427
I told you before.
You can't be standing still.

559
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:46,931
You can't fight his fight!
You have to fight your own fight!

560
00:35:47,014 --> 00:35:49,934
He boxed me in the West
and the-and-and-and the Midwest...

561
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:51,936
where nobody knew nothin'
about boxing.

562
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:54,021
Wasn't no real competition.

563
00:35:54,105 --> 00:35:57,400
These were, how you say,
uh-uh-uh, non-sanctioned.

564
00:35:57,483 --> 00:35:59,652
But, hell, I could be a winner.

565
00:36:18,756 --> 00:36:22,260
So, I fought and fought.
Must've been, like, every other week.

566
00:36:32,938 --> 00:36:35,107
Knocked all of'em out.

567
00:36:39,653 --> 00:36:45,117
And in this corner,
weighing a lean, mean 185 pounds...

568
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:51,165
from Chicago, Illinois,
Battlin' Bob Satterfield!

569
00:36:51,249 --> 00:36:54,044
But maybe I-I-I...How-How you say...

570
00:36:54,127 --> 00:36:56,129
Boxed-Boxed too much.

571
00:36:56,212 --> 00:36:58,632
One day I was just plain exhausted
and beat to shit.

572
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:11,228
Some huge boy knocked me down hard.

573
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,442
Knocked me in the eye.

574
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:19,320
And messed up my vision real bad.

575
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:25,202
Then I-I-I-I-I just- I just couldn't
fight no more after that.

576
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:31,125
And that-That son of a bitch owner,
he kept all the money.

577
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:34,879
He said, uh, I had messed up
the merchandise.

578
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:41,385
So, then I hitched my way down here.

579
00:37:46,724 --> 00:37:48,727
I remember fighting out here once.

580
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:54,566
Air was clean.

581
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,445
Been out here
for, ooh, 40-somethin' years.

582
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:02,032
Jesus Christ.

583
00:38:02,116 --> 00:38:04,034
This is all I could find on your guy.

584
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,039
I'll keep looking,
but there's not a lot out there.

585
00:38:08,122 --> 00:38:11,000
- Thank you.
- Sorry.

586
00:38:11,042 --> 00:38:13,336
Did you find the contact information
on Satterfield Jr.?

587
00:38:13,419 --> 00:38:15,505
There are no listings in Ohio,
where he's from.

588
00:38:15,547 --> 00:38:19,259
But I'll try New York, and then Pennsylvania.
And we'll go from there.

589
00:38:19,342 --> 00:38:22,679
- Thanks.
- I did also find this.

590
00:38:24,723 --> 00:38:26,350
What's that?

591
00:38:26,433 --> 00:38:29,478
Did you get that press release
from the mayor's office?

592
00:38:34,901 --> 00:38:38,279
I'll call you back. Come right on in.

593
00:38:39,822 --> 00:38:42,283
What's this?

594
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:47,706
That... is Battlin' Bob Satterfield.
Fightin'Joe Blow.

595
00:38:47,789 --> 00:38:50,042
Joe Blow.
You don't know who he's fighting?

596
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:54,088
- I'm questioning those investigative skills there.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

597
00:38:54,171 --> 00:38:57,800
We got this off a collector.
It's the only one we could find.

598
00:38:59,677 --> 00:39:01,762
Beautiful.

599
00:39:02,972 --> 00:39:06,100
To be a reporter back then.
Can you imagine?

600
00:39:07,393 --> 00:39:09,938
You really are only as good
as the athletes you cover.

601
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:14,484
Which one's Satterfield?

602
00:39:14,568 --> 00:39:17,654
He's, uh, this one here.

603
00:39:17,738 --> 00:39:19,698
- See the scar on his back?
- Mm-hmm.

604
00:39:19,782 --> 00:39:22,868
His dad gave him that when he was
nine years old. Can you believe that?

605
00:39:30,293 --> 00:39:32,837
Perfect. Perfect.

606
00:39:34,214 --> 00:39:36,132
Champ, how's it goin', man?

607
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:40,178
Champ. What's up?

608
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:44,433
Jesus Christ, man,
what happened to your eye?

609
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:51,607
Those kids do that?

610
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,946
- You probably need a drink, huh?
- I need a drink bad.

611
00:39:57,029 --> 00:39:59,782
These guys are gonna give you a drink
if you sweep up?

612
00:39:59,866 --> 00:40:03,453
Yeah. But they said the wind
done already done it.

613
00:40:03,536 --> 00:40:07,040
But sometime they change their mind.

614
00:40:07,123 --> 00:40:10,168
Champ, I'm gonna get you a drink.
But then I gotta show you something, okay?

615
00:40:10,252 --> 00:40:12,170
It's gonna blow your mind.

616
00:40:12,254 --> 00:40:16,508
- Hey.

617
00:40:16,592 --> 00:40:18,511
I really appreciate it.

618
00:40:18,594 --> 00:40:22,265
- So it's just two minutes long?
- Yeah, yeah. If that.

619
00:40:26,853 --> 00:40:29,481
Hey, Champ. Champ.

620
00:40:50,378 --> 00:40:53,381
Who's that you're fightin' there,
Champ?

621
00:40:53,464 --> 00:40:57,802
Satterfield versus Kincaid.
Tommy Kincaid.

622
00:40:57,886 --> 00:41:01,181
Never had it in him to hurt a man.
That was his problem.

623
00:41:03,225 --> 00:41:06,728
He had skills though.
He had a hammer.!

624
00:41:12,735 --> 00:41:15,571
Where'd you get this?

625
00:41:15,655 --> 00:41:19,784
Well, Champ, I'm a world-class
investigative journalist.

626
00:41:19,867 --> 00:41:21,786
This is what I do.

627
00:41:38,387 --> 00:41:41,348
Is that the same guy?

628
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:43,768
- Who? The guy on the tape?
- Yeah.

629
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:46,729
- I can't tell.
- How y'all doin'?

630
00:41:54,446 --> 00:41:57,449
Hey, can I get that back?

631
00:41:57,532 --> 00:41:59,451
Could I- Quickly, actually.

632
00:41:59,534 --> 00:42:03,998
Hey, Champ. Champ!

633
00:42:04,081 --> 00:42:06,417
Hey, you all right?

634
00:42:07,877 --> 00:42:11,172
I thought- I'm sorry.
I thought you'd like that.

635
00:42:14,175 --> 00:42:16,094
You got kids?

636
00:42:16,177 --> 00:42:20,557
Yeah, I got a six-year-old.
Boy. His name's Teddy.

637
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,478
Well, I hope that one day, God willing...

638
00:42:24,561 --> 00:42:27,981
your son does for you
what you just done for me in there.

639
00:42:32,778 --> 00:42:34,864
Hey, wait, where you goin'?

640
00:42:34,947 --> 00:42:36,949
I thought that'd be a good line
to exit on.

641
00:42:37,033 --> 00:42:42,664
I- I still need more for my story.

642
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,672
There's the-That-There.
That house right there.

643
00:42:50,755 --> 00:42:53,300
- Don't stop. Keep goin'.
- Why?

644
00:42:53,383 --> 00:42:55,886
Betty in there.
She come out here, she whoop us both.

645
00:42:55,969 --> 00:42:59,807
- Who's Betty?
- Betty used to be my wife.

646
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:02,184
Well, she probably still is.

647
00:43:04,812 --> 00:43:06,898
I thought Lona was your wife.

648
00:43:06,981 --> 00:43:10,652
Lona was my first wife.
You got a wife?

649
00:43:12,111 --> 00:43:15,490
Yeah, I got a great wife. Joyce.

650
00:43:15,573 --> 00:43:18,160
We went to Columbia together.
She works at the paper too.

651
00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:21,997
She was a grad student,
I was a sophomore and...

652
00:43:23,874 --> 00:43:25,960
She got pregnant.

653
00:43:28,045 --> 00:43:30,047
We're separated now though.

654
00:43:30,131 --> 00:43:33,134
- Oh, she done kicked your ass out, huh?
- Yeah.

655
00:43:35,136 --> 00:43:37,931
What for?

656
00:43:38,014 --> 00:43:41,935
Champ, when I figure that out,
maybe I can fix it.

657
00:43:42,018 --> 00:43:46,189
Mmm. I'll tell ya, you know, w-w-women
ain't gonna never tell you what's wrong.

658
00:43:46,231 --> 00:43:49,026
And if you don't know,
that's just too bad.

659
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:51,528
Yeah. That sounds about right.

660
00:43:53,238 --> 00:43:58,077
- You love your son?
- Yeah. Yes, very much. Very much.

661
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,121
Yeah, you gots to love 'em, don't ya?

662
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:02,999
Gotta love 'em more than anything
in this whole world!

663
00:44:03,082 --> 00:44:07,504
You gotta love 'em, like-
How they say, um, mucho grande.

664
00:44:09,089 --> 00:44:12,759
- That's right. Mucho grande.
- Mucho grande.

665
00:44:12,843 --> 00:44:18,766
My son, Bob Jr., with my first wife, lona-
He tells everybody I'm dead.

666
00:44:18,849 --> 00:44:22,061
Why's that?

667
00:44:22,144 --> 00:44:26,732
Is he ashamed of you
because you live on the street, or...

668
00:44:26,816 --> 00:44:30,403
Oh, it's, uh, probably
'cause I left him and his mama.

669
00:44:32,655 --> 00:44:35,909
- Really? How old was he?
- Six.

670
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:38,495
So, that was what, like, 40 years ago?

671
00:44:38,578 --> 00:44:43,458
I mean, come on, Junior, get over it.
Move on with your life.

672
00:44:46,545 --> 00:44:48,464
Mm-hmm.

673
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,552
Yeah, I like to come back here
to-to-to Five Points...

674
00:44:53,636 --> 00:44:56,055
and-and just look at the house
and, uh, imagine Betty inside.

675
00:44:56,056 --> 00:44:59,559
And-and just look at the house
and, uh, imagine Betty inside.

676
00:45:00,643 --> 00:45:02,937
But-But-But I can't go in.

677
00:45:02,979 --> 00:45:05,690
My feet say go, but my head say no.

678
00:45:08,652 --> 00:45:11,989
Look. You have to promise me,
you ain't gonna mess with Betty, all right?

679
00:45:12,072 --> 00:45:15,367
'Cause if you do that, th-then you
be gettin' in my personal business.

680
00:45:15,451 --> 00:45:18,996
Okay. Okay.

681
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,332
Promise.

682
00:45:21,415 --> 00:45:23,918
- Dad?
- Yeah, buddy?

683
00:45:24,001 --> 00:45:27,297
- What kind of dog is Snoopy?
- Uh, he's a beagle.

684
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:31,009
- He doesn't look like a beagle.
- Well, that's what he is.

685
00:45:31,092 --> 00:45:34,554
Keith's got a beagle,
and she doesn't look like Snoopy at all.

686
00:45:34,638 --> 00:45:36,598
Oh, really? Thank you very much.

687
00:45:36,682 --> 00:45:38,809
- Is that true?
- Can we get a beagle?

688
00:45:38,892 --> 00:45:43,355
I don't think that's really my call.
Especially when I'm not in the house.

689
00:45:43,397 --> 00:45:45,649
- Here's your favorite table, sir.
- All right.

690
00:45:45,691 --> 00:45:48,986
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

691
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:52,031
Dad, look. John Elway.

692
00:45:53,324 --> 00:45:56,661
Can I meet him, Dad?
Can I talk to him? Please, Dad?

693
00:45:57,704 --> 00:46:00,332
Um, you know what?

694
00:46:00,415 --> 00:46:03,418
It's really not that cool
to go up to celebrities in public.

695
00:46:03,502 --> 00:46:05,671
But he's not a celebrity.
He's your friend.

696
00:46:05,754 --> 00:46:09,091
Even still. Okay?

697
00:46:09,174 --> 00:46:11,927
Why can't you just talk to your friend?

698
00:46:14,722 --> 00:46:18,351
It's a grown-up thing, buddy.
Let's go see your mom. Grab your jacket.

699
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:23,064
Come on. Let's go.

700
00:46:23,148 --> 00:46:25,066
Hey, hey, hey. Teddy.

701
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:28,570
- Hi, Mr. Elway. I just came to say-
- Hey there, son.

702
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:31,573
- Hey, John, how ya doin'? Sorry.
- Oh, no worries.

703
00:46:31,657 --> 00:46:33,367
- What's your name?
- Teddy.

704
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:34,743
- Do you play football?
- Yeah.

705
00:46:34,827 --> 00:46:37,413
Except my hand's not big enough
to hold a real football.

706
00:46:37,496 --> 00:46:40,374
Let me see. Other hand.

707
00:46:42,251 --> 00:46:45,088
I give you three years. Your hand's
a lot bigger than mine was at your age.

708
00:46:45,171 --> 00:46:47,882
Well, we gotta go.
I'll-I'll say hi to Joyce, okay?

709
00:46:47,966 --> 00:46:49,259
- O-Okay.
- Bye, Mr. Elway.

710
00:46:49,342 --> 00:46:52,721
I hope you go back
to the Broncos next year.!

711
00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:59,561
He's a really nice guy.
We could have stayed there longer.

712
00:46:59,645 --> 00:47:02,231
You know what, buddy?
That's just the way it is, okay?

713
00:47:02,272 --> 00:47:05,484
Come on. Get up there.

714
00:47:09,614 --> 00:47:11,532
You have all these cool friends...

715
00:47:11,616 --> 00:47:13,701
and I never get to meet any of them.

716
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:21,251
You know what? You're right.
Let's fix that.

717
00:47:21,293 --> 00:47:24,463
Good ol' Rocky comes with another right,
and I go, boom, up like this!

718
00:47:24,546 --> 00:47:29,259
Yeah. That's just the way it happened too.

719
00:47:29,343 --> 00:47:34,014
Remember, Marciano was the only
heavyweight champ to retire undefeated.

720
00:47:34,098 --> 00:47:37,935
- Wow.
- Yeah. He died in a plane crash.

721
00:47:38,019 --> 00:47:43,733
Say, man, 'bout how old are you, huh?
What? Like, 15?

722
00:47:43,817 --> 00:47:47,237
- I'm six.
- Oh! You look 15.

723
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,657
You wanna know how you grow up
to be big and strong like Champ?

724
00:47:51,783 --> 00:47:53,702
Every morning when you get up...

725
00:47:53,785 --> 00:47:57,539
gotta roll your sleeve up like this
and...

726
00:47:57,623 --> 00:47:59,959
blow.

727
00:48:00,042 --> 00:48:01,794
Yep.

728
00:48:01,877 --> 00:48:05,673
And-And-And-And see, it ain't so much
about how old you are, all right?

729
00:48:05,756 --> 00:48:07,759
It's-It's all about your conditioning.

730
00:48:07,842 --> 00:48:12,847
You got to build up your legs 'cause you
gonna need them for a long, long time.

731
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:16,434
And-And you got to live right.
You have to live clean.

732
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:21,064
And-And-And don't run-
Don't run around with the wrong crowd.

733
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:25,069
'Cause, because you can't do that.
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

734
00:48:32,994 --> 00:48:34,954
Hey, Champ?

735
00:48:36,164 --> 00:48:37,165
- Champ?
- Hmm?

736
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:39,501
- You okay?
- Yeah.! Yeah, yeah.

737
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:41,503
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah.

738
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:44,840
Uh-uh-And-And, see, your dad-
Dad, he ain't perfect.

739
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:47,676
But he's doin' the best he can.
Yeah.

740
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:53,015
He been down and almost out.
But-But he loves you. Yes, he do.

741
00:48:53,098 --> 00:48:56,852
And one day, he's gonna get his shot.

742
00:49:00,022 --> 00:49:02,817
So, if any of your friends don't believe
that you met him, you can...

743
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,612
just tell them they can read my article
when it comes out in the Times.

744
00:49:05,695 --> 00:49:08,657
- Okay.
- Okay.

745
00:49:11,827 --> 00:49:14,246
Hey, what's the matter?
You didn't like meeting Champ?

746
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:17,040
- No, I did.
- Then what's the matter?

747
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:20,544
I just don't like that Champ
lives on the street.

748
00:49:20,628 --> 00:49:23,881
Yeah, buddy, I don't like that either.

749
00:49:23,923 --> 00:49:26,217
Maybe he could move in with us.

750
00:49:28,636 --> 00:49:31,306
Yeah, maybe you should
ask your mom about that one.

751
00:49:33,141 --> 00:49:35,060
Local network was right behind us.!

752
00:49:35,143 --> 00:49:37,103
Hey, Erik. Got something for ya.

753
00:49:38,605 --> 00:49:39,773
Heard of this guy?

754
00:49:39,856 --> 00:49:43,777
Um, uh, yeah. I've heard-
I've heard of this guy.

755
00:49:43,861 --> 00:49:46,071
Good. He's the only one
Satterfield fought that I could find.

756
00:49:46,155 --> 00:49:49,408
Most of them are dead. I took the liberty
of setting up an interview time with him.

757
00:49:49,492 --> 00:49:51,410
- When?
- Today at 4:00.

758
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:54,080
An interview with the Raging Bull.

759
00:49:54,163 --> 00:49:57,834
And... Satterfield Jr. Of Chicago.

760
00:49:58,877 --> 00:50:01,588
Only living relative.

761
00:50:01,629 --> 00:50:04,925
- I could kiss you right now.
- I could sue you.

762
00:50:12,057 --> 00:50:13,976
Awesome.

763
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:33,830
- Hello?
- Mr. Satterfield?

764
00:50:33,914 --> 00:50:38,877
- Yes?
- Hi, this is Erik Kernan of The Denver Times. How ya doin'?

765
00:50:38,961 --> 00:50:41,755
- Erik Kernan?
- Yes.

766
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,842
I wanted to ask you a couple questions
about your father. Is that all right?

767
00:50:44,925 --> 00:50:47,261
- My father?
- Yeah.

768
00:50:47,345 --> 00:50:49,680
Fuck you.

769
00:51:03,487 --> 00:51:04,905
Erik Kernan.

770
00:51:04,988 --> 00:51:08,576
- Erik, hi, Bing Whitley.
- Hi, Bing, how are you?

771
00:51:08,659 --> 00:51:11,746
Good. Listen, I've got our beloved publisher,
Fred Roselle, here with me.

772
00:51:11,829 --> 00:51:14,874
- Can I put you on speaker?
- Yeah, uh, sure.

773
00:51:17,004 --> 00:51:21,175
- Erik? Fred Roselle.
- Uh, hi, sir.

774
00:51:21,259 --> 00:51:25,053
Now, Bing tells me
about your Satterfield story.

775
00:51:25,137 --> 00:51:29,267
Honest to God, it floored me.
I thought he died 20 years ago.

776
00:51:30,392 --> 00:51:32,687
- No, I see him every day.
- There you go.

777
00:51:32,729 --> 00:51:38,525
You see, I read 10 stories a week
about fighters in their glory years.

778
00:51:38,608 --> 00:51:40,653
But they never tell you
about the price they paid...

779
00:51:40,736 --> 00:51:42,906
taking all those shots to the head.

780
00:51:42,989 --> 00:51:45,282
Well, he definitely paid a price, sir.

781
00:51:45,365 --> 00:51:47,869
Yeah, well,
that's a story I'll go along with.

782
00:51:47,952 --> 00:51:51,330
Hell, I'll even get you
on the cover of the magazine.

783
00:51:52,748 --> 00:51:56,210
And Metz doesn't want any part
of this piece, is that right?

784
00:51:56,294 --> 00:51:59,088
No, he, uh- he called it a dry hole.

785
00:51:59,171 --> 00:52:01,090
That's just amazing.

786
00:52:01,174 --> 00:52:05,470
So, uh, any idea
how soon we could see it?

787
00:52:05,553 --> 00:52:10,183
- Well, I don't want to rush it.
- Of course not.

788
00:52:10,267 --> 00:52:13,478
Uh, so I guess-
I was thinking maybe two weeks?

789
00:52:13,562 --> 00:52:16,146
I have some interviews
I'd like to take care of and...

790
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:19,567
We just dropped a retro piece on Gary Hart.
How about Monday?

791
00:52:20,986 --> 00:52:23,154
Yeah, sure.
Monday. I could manage that.

792
00:52:24,156 --> 00:52:26,198
Okay, beautiful.

793
00:52:36,959 --> 00:52:42,090
Hey. There he is.
Just give me a second, okay?

794
00:52:42,132 --> 00:52:43,966
Hey, Champ!

795
00:52:44,051 --> 00:52:46,219
Hey! Hey, kid! How ya doin'?

796
00:52:47,303 --> 00:52:49,431
- Just about 100%, Champ.
- A hundred percent?

797
00:52:49,473 --> 00:52:53,352
Whoo, I ain't been
a hundred percent in years.

798
00:52:53,434 --> 00:52:55,437
So, where's the photographer?

799
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,274
He's just across the street.
But I just wanted to, um...

800
00:52:58,315 --> 00:53:02,986
I wanted to, uh- I got a friend of yours
who wants to talk to you.

801
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:04,947
- I ain't know I had no friends.
- Sure, you do.

802
00:53:04,989 --> 00:53:07,156
Outside of you, that is.

803
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,242
Well, let me prove you wrong.

804
00:53:09,326 --> 00:53:12,704
Hold on a sec.

805
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:18,961
- Yeah?
- Mr. LaMotta?

806
00:53:19,044 --> 00:53:20,962
Who's this?

807
00:53:21,045 --> 00:53:23,674
This is Erik Kernan of The Denver Times.
We spoke earlier.

808
00:53:23,757 --> 00:53:27,886
Yeah. You said you wanted
to talk about Bob Satterfield.

809
00:53:27,969 --> 00:53:29,930
Jake-Jake,
I'm-I'm-I'm standing right here.

810
00:53:30,013 --> 00:53:32,891
Goddamn, Bob, I thought you were dead!

811
00:53:32,975 --> 00:53:35,895
Well, some days I feel like it, yeah.

812
00:53:35,978 --> 00:53:38,188
- Hey, kid?
- Yeah?

813
00:53:38,271 --> 00:53:43,986
Besides Bob Satterfield, the only ones
who ever hurt me were my ex-wives.

814
00:53:44,069 --> 00:53:46,488
Is that right?

815
00:53:46,572 --> 00:53:49,992
Yeah. Well, you know,
it's really good to- How you say, uh...

816
00:53:50,033 --> 00:53:52,244
Um, uh-uh, talk to you.
How you doin'?

817
00:53:52,328 --> 00:53:56,915
I'm good. Real good.
Had some trouble, but I'm okay now.

818
00:53:56,999 --> 00:53:59,836
I know. I know. I-I-I seen your movie.

819
00:53:59,919 --> 00:54:02,337
- You like it?
- Well, y-yeah.

820
00:54:02,379 --> 00:54:05,382
Except for the part where you knock me out.

821
00:54:05,465 --> 00:54:08,844
Bob, you sure you're okay?

822
00:54:08,927 --> 00:54:14,392
The kid tells me you're out on the street.
You're a bum or something?

823
00:54:14,433 --> 00:54:19,187
No. No, no. I ain't no bum, Jake.
I'm, I-I'm just homeless.

824
00:54:19,271 --> 00:54:23,193
I-I-Look, I, uh-
I have to go, all right?

825
00:54:23,234 --> 00:54:26,780
Okay. Bye, Bob.

826
00:54:28,072 --> 00:54:31,158
- Thanks, Mr. LaMotta.
- Is he really okay?

827
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,079
Yeah. I think so.

828
00:54:34,161 --> 00:54:37,457
I thought he was dead.
Boy, oh, boy.

829
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:40,877
There but for the grace of God go I.

830
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,880
Well, thanks a lot for speaking with me.

831
00:54:43,922 --> 00:54:45,882
- Okay.
- Bye.

832
00:54:47,259 --> 00:54:50,887
Champ!
He just said there was a time...

833
00:54:50,929 --> 00:54:53,849
where you could have been
the best boxer in the world.

834
00:54:53,974 --> 00:54:58,436
That's-That's really somethin'
comin' from the Raging Bull, huh?

835
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:03,566
Hey, Chris.! We're ready.!

836
00:55:03,607 --> 00:55:06,403
Denver is now just one
of three cities left in the running...

837
00:55:06,486 --> 00:55:09,072
to host the 2008
Democratic National Convention.

838
00:55:09,155 --> 00:55:12,575
New Orleans has dropped out.
So, that leaves Denver, New York...

839
00:55:12,659 --> 00:55:14,703
and Minneapolis still in the race.

840
00:55:23,211 --> 00:55:25,922
Hey, Bruce! Bruce!
Can I take one of these?

841
00:55:25,964 --> 00:55:27,925
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks a lot, man.

842
00:55:42,148 --> 00:55:44,942
- Mom, it's here.!
- Bring it in.!

843
00:55:51,364 --> 00:55:53,283
It should in the middle by the coupons.

844
00:55:55,453 --> 00:55:59,290
Ah, there. You got it. You got it.

845
00:55:59,332 --> 00:56:03,126
Cool! The Champ! That's the guy
I was talking to you about, remember?

846
00:56:03,168 --> 00:56:05,671
I know! What does that say?

847
00:56:05,755 --> 00:56:09,716
- Resurrec...
- What does that say?

848
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:15,765
- By Erik Kernan. Cool.
- Yeah. Cool.

849
00:56:18,933 --> 00:56:21,437
- Erik, great job on the article.
- Hey, thanks, Rob.

850
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,241
Hey, Ralph.

851
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:38,703
- Nice piece on this guy.
- Thanks.

852
00:56:41,582 --> 00:56:43,501
Word is you're moving upstairs.

853
00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:47,796
Yeah. Maybe it's a better fit.

854
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:50,966
Maybe.

855
00:56:52,176 --> 00:56:54,595
Answer your phone, Erik.

856
00:57:02,311 --> 00:57:04,231
Kernan.

857
00:57:04,313 --> 00:57:07,359
Hey, Boy Wonder, this is Andrea Flak.
How you doing?

858
00:57:07,442 --> 00:57:09,776
This was one holy-moly story you wrote.

859
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,779
My team was on it lickety-split.

860
00:57:11,862 --> 00:57:13,949
You are on your way to a Pulitzer, Erik.

861
00:57:14,032 --> 00:57:16,366
And we want you here.

862
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:19,287
How you feeling? Fan-damn-tastic?

863
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:23,415
I'm good. I'm all right.
Yeah. Uh-Who are you with?

864
00:57:23,499 --> 00:57:26,710
What? Oh.
I'm with Showtime, yeah.

865
00:57:26,752 --> 00:57:30,799
Oh, God. I loved this article.
Made me cry.

866
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:32,967
- Mm-hmm.
- And trust me, that is a considerable compliment...

867
00:57:33,051 --> 00:57:35,720
to your literary skills, 'cause I didn't cry
when my golden retriever died.

868
00:57:35,762 --> 00:57:39,599
- Be proud.
- Thank you. Thanks a lot.

869
00:57:39,682 --> 00:57:42,685
So I'm sure everyone wants a piece of you.
You must be swamped with calls.

870
00:57:42,769 --> 00:57:45,646
- Actually, you're my first.
- That's a surprise.

871
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:47,648
Uh, looks like
I have some messages though.

872
00:57:47,732 --> 00:57:50,484
Erik, we want to give you a tryout
at Showtime Boxing...

873
00:57:50,568 --> 00:57:55,073
get you on the air, in Vegas, interview
Kid McCracken after the fight Saturday night.

874
00:57:55,157 --> 00:57:58,076
- Sound good to you?
- Yeah, yeah.

875
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,537
That sounds, uh- sounds great.

876
00:58:00,579 --> 00:58:03,164
Beautiful. Get your tux dry-cleaned.

877
00:58:03,248 --> 00:58:05,167
We'll talk.

878
00:58:09,088 --> 00:58:12,299
You know, the syndication on this story
is pretty much through the roof.

879
00:58:12,383 --> 00:58:14,675
You made me look good, Erik.
You did. Thank you.

880
00:58:14,759 --> 00:58:17,596
- Really. Thank you.
- Thank you, Bing. Thank you.

881
00:58:17,678 --> 00:58:22,518
See, Erik, this is the kind of piece that can
get you places. You're gonna have offers.

882
00:58:22,601 --> 00:58:24,602
- You think so?
- Oh, yeah. You're gonna have offers.

883
00:58:24,685 --> 00:58:27,105
Now, all I ask is
for another year from you.

884
00:58:27,189 --> 00:58:29,108
I mean, uh, uh...

885
00:58:29,191 --> 00:58:32,110
- Hey.
- Hey. This is Polly. Polly, this is Bing.

886
00:58:32,151 --> 00:58:33,945
- Hi, Polly.
- Mr. Whitley, nice to meet you.

887
00:58:34,029 --> 00:58:36,615
- She works at the newspaper as well.
- Did I ever hit on you?

888
00:58:36,698 --> 00:58:39,660
- Uh, no.
- What was I thinking?

889
00:58:39,744 --> 00:58:43,164
- She's actually- I couldn't have done this story without her.
- Really?

890
00:58:43,247 --> 00:58:45,623
- She's the rising star of the newspaper.
- Really?

891
00:58:45,665 --> 00:58:49,503
Um, so, look.
Well, can the rising star get a dance?

892
00:58:49,587 --> 00:58:51,547
- Yeah, sure. Yeah. Okay-
- Okay.

893
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:54,007
- Go ahead. Have fun.
- All right. I'll see you in a second.

894
00:58:54,091 --> 00:58:56,009
- Bye.
- Nice meeting you.

895
00:58:56,093 --> 00:58:58,845
- Okay.

896
00:59:01,181 --> 00:59:04,393
- It's a great piece, Erik.
- Thank you.

897
00:59:04,476 --> 00:59:07,146
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.

898
00:59:07,229 --> 00:59:09,230
Metz, um- Metz got pretty pissed...

899
00:59:09,314 --> 00:59:11,650
when I told him I helped you with it.

900
00:59:11,692 --> 00:59:13,820
Why'd you tell him?

901
00:59:13,903 --> 00:59:16,739
Because it made me proud,
being involved in the piece.

902
00:59:18,991 --> 00:59:21,452
So, you gonna be
on Showtime now, or what?

903
00:59:23,161 --> 00:59:25,915
Well, they've been calling,
which is...

904
00:59:25,997 --> 00:59:28,918
- Not surprising.
- Amazing. Pretty amazing.

905
00:59:29,001 --> 00:59:30,962
Pretty amazing.

906
00:59:32,838 --> 00:59:35,257
What a night, right?

907
00:59:35,341 --> 00:59:37,260
What a night.

908
00:59:38,803 --> 00:59:40,722
What a night.

909
00:59:42,682 --> 00:59:46,102
Hey-Just give me-
Give me a minute, okay? I'll be...

910
00:59:46,185 --> 00:59:48,104
- I'll be back, all right?
- Yeah.

911
00:59:48,187 --> 00:59:50,439
Okay.

912
01:00:12,712 --> 01:00:15,548
Hey. Joyce, it's me.

913
01:00:17,549 --> 01:00:19,886
Hey, why don't you come out
and help me celebrate?

914
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:23,139
Come on. It's early.

915
01:00:36,694 --> 01:00:37,028
So, um, let me ask you a question.

916
01:00:37,029 --> 01:00:40,073
So, um, let me ask you a question.

917
01:00:40,156 --> 01:00:42,075
Yep.

918
01:00:42,159 --> 01:00:45,119
Why didn't they use
the picture of me flexing?

919
01:00:45,202 --> 01:00:47,122
I don't know.

920
01:00:47,205 --> 01:00:49,999
Photo editor makes those calls. I...

921
01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:52,961
I tell you what.
I would've picked that one. Yeah.

922
01:00:53,044 --> 01:00:55,756
- Yeah, that's the one I would've used too.
- Really?

923
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:59,051
So, we done good, huh?

924
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:02,763
Yeah, we did great, Champ.

925
01:01:20,781 --> 01:01:22,867
Yeah? Hello?

926
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:25,451
Is this Erik Kernan?

927
01:01:25,535 --> 01:01:29,707
Yeah. Who's this?

928
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:32,209
My name's Ike Epstein.

929
01:01:32,292 --> 01:01:35,462
You write that article about Satterfield?

930
01:01:35,546 --> 01:01:38,716
- Yeah.
- Nice story.

931
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:40,884
Mm-Thank you.

932
01:01:40,967 --> 01:01:45,347
But Satterfield's dead. Twenty years.

933
01:01:45,431 --> 01:01:48,517
Bob Satterfield died in, uh...

934
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,520
'82, '83.

935
01:01:51,603 --> 01:01:53,606
I just saw him last night.

936
01:01:53,689 --> 01:01:56,483
Not Satterfield.

937
01:01:56,524 --> 01:01:59,195
Yeah, Satterfield. I-I...

938
01:01:59,278 --> 01:02:02,907
I spoke with his son... on the phone.

939
01:02:02,989 --> 01:02:05,326
His son told you he was alive?

940
01:02:05,409 --> 01:02:08,662
- No, but they don't get along-
- Let's get to the bottom of this.

941
01:02:08,746 --> 01:02:10,748
Okay.

942
01:02:13,167 --> 01:02:16,962
Did you talk to, uh...

943
01:02:17,003 --> 01:02:19,090
Satterfield's trainers?

944
01:02:20,424 --> 01:02:23,344
His ringmen? Anybody like that?

945
01:02:23,426 --> 01:02:26,180
Most of them-
I couldn't dig 'em up.

946
01:02:28,308 --> 01:02:30,226
Ernie...

947
01:02:30,308 --> 01:02:32,228
Ike Epstein.

948
01:02:34,313 --> 01:02:38,693
I'm good. Ernie,
you remember Bob Satterfield...

949
01:02:38,735 --> 01:02:40,694
Chicago boy?

950
01:02:40,736 --> 01:02:42,613
Mm-hmm.

951
01:02:43,947 --> 01:02:46,743
Well, you think he's dead
or you know he's dead?

952
01:02:46,826 --> 01:02:49,370
Ah, that's-that's what I think.

953
01:02:49,453 --> 01:02:51,372
Okay.

954
01:02:51,455 --> 01:02:54,166
Thanks. Take care of yourself.

955
01:02:55,168 --> 01:02:57,086
He thinks he's dead.

956
01:02:57,170 --> 01:02:59,630
It's impossible.

957
01:02:59,714 --> 01:03:02,426
Never use that word anymore.

958
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:15,187
Freddy? Ike.

959
01:03:15,229 --> 01:03:19,067
Listen.
You remember Bob Satterfield?

960
01:03:20,944 --> 01:03:24,364
Yeah.
But do you know that for sure?

961
01:03:28,034 --> 01:03:31,037
Okay. Thanks.

962
01:03:31,121 --> 01:03:34,082
No, they're good.
Thank you. Thank you.

963
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:38,961
He thinks he's dead,
but he's not sure.

964
01:03:39,045 --> 01:03:41,964
- Who was that?
- Freddy Bingham.

965
01:03:42,048 --> 01:03:45,718
Impossible.
Freddy Bingham is dead.

966
01:03:49,305 --> 01:03:51,516
I just talked to him on the telephone.

967
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,477
It was Freddy Benjamin you talked to.

968
01:03:53,561 --> 01:03:55,853
Freddy Benjamin is dead.

969
01:03:55,937 --> 01:03:59,023
- Two years ago.
- I saw Freddy Benjamin last Christmas.

970
01:03:59,107 --> 01:04:01,568
Freddy Benjamin is a putz.

971
01:04:01,652 --> 01:04:04,030
Plus, he's dead.

972
01:04:05,239 --> 01:04:07,616
Like Satterfield.

973
01:04:20,211 --> 01:04:24,175
- Hey, Champ.
- Hey, amigo. Want something to eat?

974
01:04:24,258 --> 01:04:27,136
Uh, nah. How you doin'?

975
01:04:27,178 --> 01:04:30,890
Oh, about 80%. Oh, maybe 90% today.

976
01:04:30,973 --> 01:04:33,558
Yeah. Movin' up in the world, huh?

977
01:04:33,642 --> 01:04:37,020
Fella stopped by, gave me a hundred dollars.
Read the article in the paper.

978
01:04:37,103 --> 01:04:39,899
Champ, I got a question for you.

979
01:04:39,981 --> 01:04:42,234
It's important. Um...

980
01:04:42,318 --> 01:04:45,154
Do you have a... I.D.?

981
01:04:45,195 --> 01:04:48,991
Anything with your-
Driver's license, maybe?

982
01:04:49,074 --> 01:04:50,992
What do you need that for?

983
01:04:51,077 --> 01:04:53,870
So that I can prove that you are
who you say you are.

984
01:04:53,954 --> 01:04:58,668
I mean, this guy- this ex-boxing guy-
he-he thinks that you died, and...

985
01:04:58,709 --> 01:05:02,296
Some mornings I wake up, I think I'm dead too.

986
01:05:02,379 --> 01:05:04,423
Yeah.

987
01:05:04,506 --> 01:05:09,887
No, seriously though.
I just- I need something, uh...

988
01:05:09,971 --> 01:05:14,600
that I can prove
that you're Bob Satterfield with.

989
01:05:16,394 --> 01:05:19,105
What did you say your name is again?

990
01:05:19,188 --> 01:05:21,106
Erik Kernan.

991
01:05:21,189 --> 01:05:24,277
- Can you prove that?
- Well, I have a driver's license with my picture on it.

992
01:05:24,359 --> 01:05:26,320
- Well, who took that picture?
- The D.M.V.

993
01:05:26,404 --> 01:05:29,949
And how did they know
you was who you said you was?

994
01:05:30,032 --> 01:05:33,202
Well, from my last driver's license
with my last picture on it.

995
01:05:33,286 --> 01:05:35,705
Oh! And who took that picture?

996
01:05:37,707 --> 01:05:40,126
You see where I'm going with this?

997
01:05:40,209 --> 01:05:42,211
No, Champ.

998
01:05:42,295 --> 01:05:45,047
I don't- I just...

999
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:47,175
I need- How about a passport?

1000
01:05:47,258 --> 01:05:51,804
Do you have a passport?
Um, any...

1001
01:05:51,887 --> 01:05:53,973
I don't know.
Anything with your picture...

1002
01:05:54,057 --> 01:05:56,018
And your name on it.

1003
01:05:57,727 --> 01:06:01,648
Denver Times.!
"Resurrection of the Champ," by Erik Kernan.

1004
01:06:01,731 --> 01:06:04,567
- That's what I got.
- Yeah.

1005
01:06:04,651 --> 01:06:07,445
Except for
that-that-that video you got.

1006
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:15,412
Where'd you get this?

1007
01:06:15,454 --> 01:06:17,622
I have a great research assistant.

1008
01:06:17,705 --> 01:06:21,126
Satterfield/Kincaid. I was there.

1009
01:06:21,209 --> 01:06:23,420
No shit? You were there?

1010
01:06:23,462 --> 01:06:26,005
- Really?
- South Bend.

1011
01:06:26,088 --> 01:06:30,511
I went to all the Satterfield fights.
That boy could punch.

1012
01:06:32,887 --> 01:06:35,265
I knew-
I mean, he showed me his scar.

1013
01:06:35,307 --> 01:06:38,185
His father did it to him when he
was nine years old. It's the same guy...

1014
01:06:38,268 --> 01:06:40,354
That's the man you interviewed?

1015
01:06:40,437 --> 01:06:42,773
- Yeah.
- The one with the scar? You're sure about that?

1016
01:06:42,855 --> 01:06:46,526
Yeah. Battlin' Bob Satterfield.

1017
01:06:46,609 --> 01:06:48,528
That's Kincaid.

1018
01:06:50,948 --> 01:06:53,951
- No-
- Satterfield's the other one.

1019
01:06:56,078 --> 01:06:58,580
You've been had, son.

1020
01:07:00,081 --> 01:07:01,958
Who would it hurt?

1021
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,044
You, for one.

1022
01:07:05,295 --> 01:07:07,213
It wouldn't hurt me
if nobody knew about it.

1023
01:07:07,297 --> 01:07:09,508
Oh, is that an option,
that nobody will know about it?

1024
01:07:09,591 --> 01:07:11,552
Joyce, let me ask you a question, okay?

1025
01:07:11,636 --> 01:07:15,472
How many newspapers print articles with
errors of fact in them every day in the U.S.?

1026
01:07:15,556 --> 01:07:18,892
It's already done, Joyce.

1027
01:07:18,976 --> 01:07:21,437
It's printed. It's out there.

1028
01:07:21,521 --> 01:07:23,897
Then print a retraction.

1029
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:29,987
I can't just do that.
People have sent in money to Champ.

1030
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:32,990
- Then give it back.
- I can't.

1031
01:07:33,073 --> 01:07:35,201
I don't know
where half of it comes from.

1032
01:07:39,163 --> 01:07:41,123
It's not just the money.

1033
01:07:42,167 --> 01:07:44,334
The Showtime job?

1034
01:07:46,086 --> 01:07:49,673
Joyce, the point of the article
is still true.

1035
01:07:49,757 --> 01:07:52,927
Okay, Erik. It's a lie.

1036
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:57,014
I mean, if you profit by a lie,
then you're the same as a liar.

1037
01:07:57,098 --> 01:07:59,142
If you write a great story
but it's a lie...

1038
01:07:59,225 --> 01:08:01,727
then you're just a liar
who writes great stories...

1039
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:03,980
which is worse than an ordinary liar...

1040
01:08:04,063 --> 01:08:07,024
because people who can write
ought to be better than your average liar.

1041
01:08:07,066 --> 01:08:11,029
So, you're a liar, and you let me down,
and you let everyone else...

1042
01:08:11,112 --> 01:08:13,906
who works on this paper down
because you ought to be better than that.

1043
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:15,909
Is that simple enough?

1044
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:20,246
- No, Joyce, that's not simple enough.
- Then let me put it another way.

1045
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:22,707
You need to behave
as if Teddy was watching.

1046
01:08:43,604 --> 01:08:46,397
And the winner, by a technical knockout...

1047
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:51,611
one minute, six seconds
into the second round, Leo McCracken.!

1048
01:09:00,077 --> 01:09:03,122
Hey, Leo! Leo!

1049
01:09:03,206 --> 01:09:05,417
Hey. So...

1050
01:09:05,458 --> 01:09:07,503
Leo McCracken...

1051
01:09:07,586 --> 01:09:11,423
Hey, Leo- Leo McCracken,
the new heavyweight champ...

1052
01:09:11,506 --> 01:09:14,468
- Oh, look, look, look, look, look! Who's that? Who's that?
- That's Daddy.

1053
01:09:14,552 --> 01:09:16,469
- It's your Daddy?
- He lived up to his nickname tonight.

1054
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:18,555
Say something to your fans.

1055
01:09:18,597 --> 01:09:20,556
First- First I want to say
"Thank you, Jesus."

1056
01:09:20,598 --> 01:09:22,768
I want to say thank you
to my trainer, Tommy McCracken...

1057
01:09:22,851 --> 01:09:26,271
and my brother and father 'cause they
used to beat the living crap right out of me.

1058
01:09:26,313 --> 01:09:29,775
And, Erik- Man, you always
believed in me, didn't you?

1059
01:09:29,817 --> 01:09:32,945
- Hard not to believe in 22-0.
- Yeah, you did! Yeah! Whoo!

1060
01:09:33,028 --> 01:09:34,947
- I get my mike back.
- Take that.

1061
01:09:35,031 --> 01:09:36,948
- Thank you.
- Number one.

1062
01:09:37,031 --> 01:09:39,910
- Looks like about all we're gonna get out of him tonight.
- Number one!

1063
01:09:39,952 --> 01:09:43,372
It's gonna be a long night for Leo McCracken-
one of the best nights of his life.

1064
01:09:43,455 --> 01:09:47,292
I love you, Teddy.

1065
01:09:49,837 --> 01:09:51,964
"I love you, Teddy."

1066
01:10:03,601 --> 01:10:06,478
Hey. Hey.

1067
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,564
Boy Wonder.

1068
01:10:10,733 --> 01:10:12,901
You were terrific.

1069
01:10:12,985 --> 01:10:14,819
Sit.

1070
01:10:15,864 --> 01:10:17,906
Thanks, Miss Flak. I, uh...

1071
01:10:17,989 --> 01:10:21,326
That was fun.
That was a lot of fun.

1072
01:10:21,368 --> 01:10:23,829
- Do you mind?
- No, not at all.

1073
01:10:23,913 --> 01:10:26,582
What a city. The only place
where you can do harm to yourself...

1074
01:10:26,665 --> 01:10:28,750
and others and smile all the way.

1075
01:10:28,834 --> 01:10:32,672
"Fun." That's good.

1076
01:10:32,756 --> 01:10:37,009
- Fun is what it's all about. I'm glad you had a good time.
- I did. I did. I'm not...

1077
01:10:37,051 --> 01:10:40,846
- You want a drink?
- Sure, yeah.

1078
01:10:40,930 --> 01:10:44,016
- I'll take a scotch on the rocks, please. Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

1079
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:48,562
They're all watered down.
But they keep 'em coming, God bless.

1080
01:10:48,645 --> 01:10:51,023
- Mmm. So-
- Yes?

1081
01:10:51,065 --> 01:10:54,652
Do you think we can turn this one-night
stand of ours into a torrid love affair?

1082
01:10:56,571 --> 01:11:00,367
I'd like that.
Very much, very much.

1083
01:11:01,576 --> 01:11:04,662
Where's the smile, Erik?

1084
01:11:04,746 --> 01:11:08,291
Well, I guess it's just that, uh...

1085
01:11:08,374 --> 01:11:12,544
I'm not sure what I... actually did.

1086
01:11:12,628 --> 01:11:15,881
You were great. Photogenic.

1087
01:11:15,923 --> 01:11:18,760
Well, thank you.

1088
01:11:18,843 --> 01:11:22,555
That's the beauty of television.
You don't have to do anything. Just be.

1089
01:11:24,807 --> 01:11:29,645
So they tell me your old man was
some sort of boxing hotshot, a real poet.

1090
01:11:29,728 --> 01:11:31,856
Yeah, yeah. He was, um...

1091
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:33,901
- One scotch.
- Thank you.

1092
01:11:35,735 --> 01:11:41,200
So, if we're gonna do this,
if we're gonna make a deal...

1093
01:11:41,283 --> 01:11:43,618
um...

1094
01:11:43,701 --> 01:11:46,163
Of course I need to continue
with my journalism.

1095
01:11:46,246 --> 01:11:51,585
Um- So I can only work part-time
at the most.

1096
01:11:51,627 --> 01:11:56,506
Well, this is a full-time gig, Erik,
with full-time pay.

1097
01:12:01,262 --> 01:12:03,721
Take a good look at me.
Are you looking?

1098
01:12:03,805 --> 01:12:05,891
Yeah.

1099
01:12:05,974 --> 01:12:08,686
Does it look like I know
the first thing about boxing?

1100
01:12:08,768 --> 01:12:12,188
Does it look like I know the difference
between a hook and an uppercut...

1101
01:12:12,272 --> 01:12:16,318
or what a standing eight count is
or what a holding penalty is?

1102
01:12:16,401 --> 01:12:19,112
See, I don't have to know
what any of that is...

1103
01:12:19,154 --> 01:12:22,616
because Showtime
has a parade of boxing experts.

1104
01:12:22,699 --> 01:12:26,703
We spend a fortune being the best
in the world at this.

1105
01:12:26,787 --> 01:12:29,040
But I am the head of casting, Erik...

1106
01:12:29,123 --> 01:12:32,251
and I am here to help Showtime
do what it does best...

1107
01:12:32,293 --> 01:12:35,755
and that is entertain the shit
out of its audience.

1108
01:12:35,838 --> 01:12:40,134
Because in the end, absolutely everything
is about entertaining the audience.

1109
01:12:44,138 --> 01:12:47,141
There is no journalism anymore.
There's no news.

1110
01:12:47,224 --> 01:12:50,519
The people who cling to the hopes
that they can inform the world...

1111
01:12:50,603 --> 01:12:53,064
are only slightly less naive
than the people who think...

1112
01:12:53,146 --> 01:12:55,065
they can pray their way
out of a tsunami.

1113
01:12:55,148 --> 01:12:59,487
And do you know
the one thing people don't want?

1114
01:12:59,571 --> 01:13:01,988
Is the truth.

1115
01:13:03,449 --> 01:13:05,826
This guy who won...

1116
01:13:05,867 --> 01:13:07,828
McCracken.

1117
01:13:07,912 --> 01:13:12,332
Do you think anybody really wants to know
how badly his brains got mangled tonight?

1118
01:13:12,374 --> 01:13:15,836
How badly his manager
is gonna rip him off...

1119
01:13:15,877 --> 01:13:18,256
or how bad his life's
gonna be in a few years?

1120
01:13:18,339 --> 01:13:20,258
Maybe end up on the street
like your bum?

1121
01:13:20,342 --> 01:13:23,261
The answer is "no."

1122
01:13:25,263 --> 01:13:27,182
It's "no."

1123
01:13:27,264 --> 01:13:30,602
Men want to see triumph,
and women, well...

1124
01:13:30,684 --> 01:13:33,438
Here you are,
with just enough credibility...

1125
01:13:33,521 --> 01:13:35,981
to make their husbands not resent you.

1126
01:13:38,276 --> 01:13:40,695
Oh. That's...

1127
01:13:42,322 --> 01:13:44,699
That doesn't sound
like much of a job at all.

1128
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:47,285
Well, it never does
until it actually is a job.

1129
01:13:51,831 --> 01:13:53,750
Who's Teddy, by the way?

1130
01:13:53,834 --> 01:13:56,335
- He's my son. He's six.
- Mm.

1131
01:13:56,418 --> 01:13:59,547
- I bet he's a cutie-pie.
- He is.

1132
01:13:59,631 --> 01:14:02,675
And proud as hell of you tonight.

1133
01:14:05,845 --> 01:14:07,764
So...

1134
01:14:07,848 --> 01:14:11,809
would you like to come
have a drink in my suite?

1135
01:14:12,852 --> 01:14:15,647
No. You know what?

1136
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:18,150
I'm gonna catch the last flight out,
but thank you.

1137
01:14:20,152 --> 01:14:22,821
Mm.

1138
01:14:22,904 --> 01:14:24,823
Monday we'll talk.

1139
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:44,009
Hey.

1140
01:14:44,091 --> 01:14:46,803
Hey.

1141
01:14:48,597 --> 01:14:51,725
I took the last flight out.
Wanted to see if I could catch Teddy.

1142
01:14:51,851 --> 01:14:55,396
All the lights were off.

1143
01:14:55,479 --> 01:15:00,442
Well, not unusual at 1:00
in the morning.

1144
01:15:01,693 --> 01:15:04,654
- Did you let him watch it?
- Are you kidding?

1145
01:15:04,737 --> 01:15:07,825
Night of his life,
seeing his dad on Showtime.

1146
01:15:11,953 --> 01:15:13,872
What'd you think? How'd I do?

1147
01:15:13,956 --> 01:15:16,792
You did exactly
as I thought you would.

1148
01:15:23,799 --> 01:15:26,302
Joyce, I can't get it off my brain.

1149
01:15:29,012 --> 01:15:31,015
That's because you're decent.

1150
01:15:37,312 --> 01:15:40,733
I'm gonna speak to Whitley tomorrow.

1151
01:15:40,816 --> 01:15:44,028
I'm gonna drop the bomb on him.

1152
01:15:44,111 --> 01:15:46,279
Good.

1153
01:15:49,282 --> 01:15:51,243
I'm so fired.

1154
01:15:52,327 --> 01:15:55,081
It's cold.

1155
01:15:55,164 --> 01:15:57,541
I can make up the guest room.

1156
01:16:02,963 --> 01:16:05,758
You know,
it seems like everybody I know...

1157
01:16:05,842 --> 01:16:09,803
everybody I meet knows
"The Wow Man" except me.

1158
01:16:12,682 --> 01:16:15,852
The only image I have of him...

1159
01:16:15,935 --> 01:16:19,063
is a bus poster and some audiotapes.

1160
01:16:21,191 --> 01:16:24,069
I don't want that to happen
to me and Teddy.

1161
01:16:24,152 --> 01:16:27,279
I want to move back home, Joyce.

1162
01:16:27,364 --> 01:16:29,449
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

1163
01:16:29,532 --> 01:16:32,869
I'll... just do...

1164
01:16:34,329 --> 01:16:37,248
I just want Teddy to know me.

1165
01:16:37,331 --> 01:16:41,128
And you think because you're here,
he'll know who you are?

1166
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:46,341
You don't know whether to run away
from your dad or to chase after him...

1167
01:16:46,424 --> 01:16:49,969
and the minute that you figure that out,
you're gonna stop running in circles.

1168
01:16:54,348 --> 01:16:57,435
Seeing Whitley...

1169
01:16:57,518 --> 01:16:59,437
it's the right thing.

1170
01:17:04,734 --> 01:17:07,653
Erik, you kicked ass on Showtime.
Congratulations.

1171
01:17:07,737 --> 01:17:09,698
- Thanks.
- Don't forget the little people.

1172
01:17:13,201 --> 01:17:15,120
Erik.

1173
01:17:17,997 --> 01:17:21,292
- Mr. Whitley, I wanted to-
- Come on in, would you?

1174
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:23,920
... talk about my family.
I want everybody to know...

1175
01:17:24,004 --> 01:17:27,466
- that everything I've ever done with my life-
- Hello, Erik.

1176
01:17:30,469 --> 01:17:34,097
- I just want you to let me do the talking. All right?
- Erik Kernan, Riley Washburn.

1177
01:17:34,181 --> 01:17:36,100
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1178
01:17:36,183 --> 01:17:38,852
I was a great fan of your dad's.

1179
01:17:38,935 --> 01:17:42,523
I'd like you to meet my client,
Robert Satterfield. Erik Kernan.

1180
01:17:45,275 --> 01:17:48,361
I traveled all this way, Mr. Kernan...

1181
01:17:48,444 --> 01:17:51,906
to look into the eyes of the man
who dared to suggest in print...

1182
01:17:53,284 --> 01:17:55,493
that I was ashamed of my father.

1183
01:17:55,577 --> 01:17:59,038
The man you've been interviewing-
Tommy Kincaid...

1184
01:17:59,122 --> 01:18:01,750
has been impersonating
Bob Satterfield for years...

1185
01:18:01,834 --> 01:18:04,795
fraudulently fought under his name
for years.

1186
01:18:04,837 --> 01:18:08,882
There was even an injunction
brought against him way back when.

1187
01:18:10,634 --> 01:18:13,471
We've come to sue your ass
right off its hinges, Mr. Kernan...

1188
01:18:13,513 --> 01:18:17,558
you and this newspaper.

1189
01:18:20,436 --> 01:18:23,523
The author of the piece
in The Denver Times is Erik Kernan Jr...

1190
01:18:23,606 --> 01:18:27,569
the son of the legendary radio
sports reporter of the same name.

1191
01:18:27,651 --> 01:18:33,156
Kernan, who recently began a broadcasting
career, has not returned calls to ESPN News.

1192
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:37,328
Reporters must be held
to a higher degree of accountability.

1193
01:18:37,412 --> 01:18:40,080
Apologies don't-
Apologies can't fix some things.

1194
01:18:40,163 --> 01:18:43,250
- You can't go around saying things
you did not follow up on.

1195
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:46,337
- Great. Great.
- Nursing your wounds with a little whiskey.

1196
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:49,674
- There's a clich for you.
- Well, what would you expect from a writer like me?

1197
01:18:49,757 --> 01:18:52,260
- Right, Ralph?
- Yeah, perfect.

1198
01:18:52,343 --> 01:18:54,679
A little humility.
And it's precisely too late...

1199
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:57,181
- Hey, you know what? Could we change this channel?
- Yeah, no problem.

1200
01:18:57,264 --> 01:19:01,102
Just change it to, like,
Golf Channel or something.

1201
01:19:01,186 --> 01:19:04,439
So, Showtime, huh?

1202
01:19:04,522 --> 01:19:07,483
I saw you. You were good.
You're a natural.

1203
01:19:12,238 --> 01:19:14,323
You know what bothers me the most?

1204
01:19:14,406 --> 01:19:17,451
What's that, Ralph?

1205
01:19:17,534 --> 01:19:20,746
I only found out about this piece
when it came out.

1206
01:19:20,829 --> 01:19:24,250
You deceived me.
You set out to deceive me.

1207
01:19:26,377 --> 01:19:28,505
That hurts my feelings.

1208
01:19:28,589 --> 01:19:32,884
Ah, come on, Ralph.
Don't get like a chick on me.

1209
01:19:41,894 --> 01:19:44,645
The magazine is gonna
have to print a retraction.

1210
01:19:44,729 --> 01:19:47,148
How big, I don't know.

1211
01:19:47,232 --> 01:19:49,401
And Satterfield Jr.
Is going to want money.

1212
01:19:49,485 --> 01:19:51,485
- Could I get another one? Thanks.
- Yeah, just a sec.

1213
01:19:51,569 --> 01:19:53,655
- And S-Are you listening to me?
- Yep.

1214
01:19:53,738 --> 01:19:56,658
- I'm over here. Look at me.
- Yes, sir.

1215
01:19:57,743 --> 01:19:59,662
There's gonna be a settlement meeting...

1216
01:19:59,745 --> 01:20:02,079
at 3:30 tomorrow afternoon.

1217
01:20:02,121 --> 01:20:04,082
You're expected to be there.

1218
01:20:05,124 --> 01:20:06,710
Okay.

1219
01:20:10,422 --> 01:20:12,340
You know,
Whitley's gonna be out on his ass...

1220
01:20:12,423 --> 01:20:14,342
on account of this-
his watch and all that.

1221
01:20:14,426 --> 01:20:16,554
And there's gonna be an internal review.

1222
01:20:16,637 --> 01:20:18,972
We're gonna wanna talk to your wife.

1223
01:20:19,974 --> 01:20:21,767
What are you talking about?

1224
01:20:21,809 --> 01:20:23,894
We want to make sure Joyce didn't
have something to do with this.

1225
01:20:23,977 --> 01:20:26,439
You know Joyce didn't have anything
to do with this. I didn't know about this.

1226
01:20:26,522 --> 01:20:29,524
Joyce is a brilliant journalist.

1227
01:20:29,607 --> 01:20:33,987
It'd be a damn shame if you somehow
sucked her down to your level.

1228
01:20:34,071 --> 01:20:36,532
Tell me.

1229
01:20:36,616 --> 01:20:40,661
Was it just sloppy journalism,
or did-did you know it was a lie?

1230
01:20:40,744 --> 01:20:45,290
- What?
- Yeah. Whatever it took to be worthy of your last name, right?

1231
01:20:45,374 --> 01:20:48,627
Here's- Here. Look.

1232
01:20:48,669 --> 01:20:53,966
That's Satterfield's obituary.
The Chicago Defender.

1233
01:20:54,008 --> 01:20:56,635
A black paper.
Misfiled, but it was there.

1234
01:20:58,137 --> 01:21:00,974
You ought to resign.
Save the paper the hassle of firing you.

1235
01:21:01,015 --> 01:21:02,974
That's for the bum.

1236
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:06,645
People have been
sending him dough for days.

1237
01:21:07,897 --> 01:21:09,814
Ralph, he's not a bum.

1238
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:12,234
He's homeless.

1239
01:21:12,318 --> 01:21:14,237
Nah, he's a bum.

1240
01:21:31,504 --> 01:21:33,922
- Champ.
- Hey, kid, how ya doin'?

1241
01:21:34,006 --> 01:21:35,967
- This is for you.
- What's that?

1242
01:21:36,050 --> 01:21:38,886
Open it.

1243
01:21:38,969 --> 01:21:42,974
- People who read your article
sent it in. It's for you.

1244
01:21:43,057 --> 01:21:45,519
It's for poor Bob Satterfield.

1245
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:48,396
Well, people can be nice.

1246
01:21:50,731 --> 01:21:52,692
You're not Bob Satterfield.

1247
01:21:52,733 --> 01:21:54,526
Who says?

1248
01:21:54,568 --> 01:21:56,571
His son, for one.

1249
01:21:56,654 --> 01:21:58,740
Yeah, well, he always
telling people I'm dead.

1250
01:21:58,824 --> 01:22:02,202
The Chicago Defender.
Ike Epstein. You know him?

1251
01:22:02,285 --> 01:22:05,706
- Sure, I know Ike! How he doin'?
- He saw the tape, Champ.

1252
01:22:06,789 --> 01:22:08,709
You're Tommy Kincaid.

1253
01:22:10,502 --> 01:22:13,671
Bob Satterfield knocked you out
in the second round!

1254
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:18,718
You made a fool out of me.

1255
01:22:18,759 --> 01:22:21,595
I didn't make no fool out of you.
Maybe you made a fool out yourself.

1256
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:25,182
Why, because I believed you?
You put my reputation on the line!

1257
01:22:25,266 --> 01:22:27,352
I didn't know you had one.
I ain't never heard of you.

1258
01:22:27,435 --> 01:22:29,897
Yeah, well,
I never heard of you either.

1259
01:22:29,979 --> 01:22:32,398
- I'm Battlin' Bob Satterfield.
- Bullshit! Bullshit!

1260
01:22:32,482 --> 01:22:35,776
I've been Satterfield longer than
you been whoever you say you is.

1261
01:22:37,237 --> 01:22:41,700
Now just go on.
Ain't nothin' else here for you.

1262
01:22:41,783 --> 01:22:43,827
I can't believe I let
another loser break my heart.

1263
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:46,831
I ain't no loser.
I fought Ezzard Charles.

1264
01:22:46,914 --> 01:22:50,834
I-I-I fought Harold Johnson
at the Polo Grounds.

1265
01:22:50,917 --> 01:22:54,421
Went the distance with Floyd Patterson.
I-I-I broke Marciano's nose!

1266
01:22:54,504 --> 01:22:58,049
- You're nothing. You're nobody.
- What you doin', kid? It's over.

1267
01:22:58,133 --> 01:23:00,136
- Just go home, okay?
- You're just another stumblebum!

1268
01:23:04,723 --> 01:23:07,351
Um, um, hi.

1269
01:23:07,435 --> 01:23:09,894
400 block of Curtis...

1270
01:23:09,978 --> 01:23:15,567
Yeah. Yeah, there's- He got knocked out,
and the guy's down. He's down on the ground.

1271
01:23:15,651 --> 01:23:17,695
It's a homeless guy.
Tell them...

1272
01:23:17,778 --> 01:23:19,696
Uh, yeah, this guy with a cart...

1273
01:23:31,458 --> 01:23:34,212
Because I work
for The Denver Times, and he's just...

1274
01:23:34,295 --> 01:23:37,255
He-He was a- He was a homeless man,
and he was an ex-boxer...

1275
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:39,550
and, I don't know,
I thought it was a good story.

1276
01:23:39,633 --> 01:23:42,761
- Oh, yeah, you're that, uh- that writer guy.
- Yeah. I'm that writer guy.

1277
01:23:42,803 --> 01:23:45,848
- And I want to press charges, okay, because the man is-
- Officer, um, excuse me.

1278
01:23:45,931 --> 01:23:49,727
- I'm sorry. My-
- He's a threat to the community, is what he is.

1279
01:23:49,810 --> 01:23:52,062
- My husband is heavily medicated.
- I want him locked up.

1280
01:23:52,146 --> 01:23:54,565
He can't be expected to make
critical judgments at this time.

1281
01:23:54,649 --> 01:23:57,067
- We'll let you know when he starts making sense.
- Okay.

1282
01:23:59,487 --> 01:24:03,574
Okay. Uh, top one's from Showtime.

1283
01:24:15,295 --> 01:24:17,255
What?

1284
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:21,091
Nothing.

1285
01:24:21,174 --> 01:24:25,347
Joyce, I don't need this right now, okay?

1286
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:27,681
I don't need a lecture. All right?

1287
01:24:30,309 --> 01:24:34,314
I know I screwed up.
It's all on me, okay?

1288
01:24:34,397 --> 01:24:36,357
I'll take care of it myself.

1289
01:24:36,399 --> 01:24:39,735
Oh, well, you certainly demonstrated
that you can handle yourself just fine.

1290
01:24:39,819 --> 01:24:41,737
I mean, I get drunk and pick fights...

1291
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:44,240
with professional boxers when I'm upset too.

1292
01:24:44,324 --> 01:24:46,451
Yeah.

1293
01:24:46,534 --> 01:24:49,371
What do you want? What?

1294
01:24:49,454 --> 01:24:52,749
I mean- Okay.

1295
01:24:52,833 --> 01:24:55,334
I'm a monumental screw-up.

1296
01:24:56,628 --> 01:24:59,381
There. Alert the media.

1297
01:24:59,423 --> 01:25:02,383
Oh, that's long done.
It's all over the wires.

1298
01:25:02,466 --> 01:25:06,805
Kernan, the great name in journalism, sullied.

1299
01:25:06,889 --> 01:25:09,140
The Rocky Mountain News
and the Post have essays...

1300
01:25:09,223 --> 01:25:13,978
on your quote-unquote "colossal blunder"
on the front page tomorrow.

1301
01:25:14,062 --> 01:25:15,688
Great.

1302
01:25:17,232 --> 01:25:19,150
I went to see him.

1303
01:25:20,152 --> 01:25:22,570
At the jailhouse.

1304
01:25:22,612 --> 01:25:24,906
He wouldn't talk to me.

1305
01:25:26,742 --> 01:25:29,327
He wouldn't talk to the other reporters
camped out at the jail either.

1306
01:25:29,410 --> 01:25:31,663
See, he's protecting your byline.

1307
01:25:31,746 --> 01:25:34,249
He still thinks he's helping his friend.

1308
01:25:34,332 --> 01:25:36,375
He humiliated me.

1309
01:25:36,459 --> 01:25:39,046
He lied to you. That's his fault.

1310
01:25:39,087 --> 01:25:42,840
You're a journalist.
You believed him. That's your fault.

1311
01:25:42,924 --> 01:25:47,513
Not to mention the fact that you're a boxing
beat reporter on a major American daily...

1312
01:25:47,596 --> 01:25:52,059
and until a few weeks ago,
you didn't know who Bob Satterfield was.

1313
01:25:54,103 --> 01:25:57,440
Look, Erik. You have a chance
to forgive this old man.

1314
01:25:58,523 --> 01:26:00,442
Take it.

1315
01:26:01,693 --> 01:26:03,653
Okay, I'll take it.

1316
01:26:19,962 --> 01:26:22,297
You owe me. Remember that.

1317
01:26:22,381 --> 01:26:24,382
I'll remember.

1318
01:26:35,061 --> 01:26:36,562
Nice suit.

1319
01:26:36,645 --> 01:26:39,982
Yeah, the Salvation Army gives them
to the police department.

1320
01:26:40,065 --> 01:26:42,277
But I think they're knockoffs,
'cause this say "Omani."

1321
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:44,319
Armani starts with a "A," right?

1322
01:26:44,361 --> 01:26:46,947
You have anywhere in particular
you want to go?

1323
01:27:37,457 --> 01:27:40,210
This, uh-This don't belong to me.

1324
01:27:40,294 --> 01:27:42,336
It belongs to Bob Satterfield.

1325
01:27:43,589 --> 01:27:45,548
Satterfield's dead.

1326
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:47,592
Well, do what you want to with it.

1327
01:27:55,684 --> 01:27:57,936
Might as well keep it.

1328
01:27:58,019 --> 01:28:01,147
- I ain't Satterfield now.
- I know.

1329
01:28:01,231 --> 01:28:03,483
All right. As long as you know.

1330
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:22,711
That fella in, uh, Sioux City...

1331
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:26,048
He come to me and say I look like him.

1332
01:28:26,131 --> 01:28:28,842
- Hey, Tommy.
- And if I fought as him I could make some money.

1333
01:28:28,925 --> 01:28:32,345
The boys tell me you used to box
before you came here.

1334
01:28:32,429 --> 01:28:35,932
- 'Cause he had a name.
- From Chicago, Illinois...

1335
01:28:36,016 --> 01:28:39,853
Battling Bob Satterfield!

1336
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:43,440
So I did it.

1337
01:28:43,482 --> 01:28:45,984
Don't nobody know no better.

1338
01:28:47,987 --> 01:28:52,033
And-And I was a winner
for the first time in my life.

1339
01:28:52,116 --> 01:28:54,075
I wasn't me no more.

1340
01:28:55,244 --> 01:28:58,121
I was- I was Satterfield, see?

1341
01:28:59,289 --> 01:29:01,751
I was somebody better.

1342
01:29:01,834 --> 01:29:04,502
Better than my own self.

1343
01:29:04,586 --> 01:29:06,171
Whoo!

1344
01:29:06,255 --> 01:29:08,256
I became Champ.

1345
01:29:10,175 --> 01:29:14,888
When I got done fighting,
I moved down here and, uh...

1346
01:29:14,971 --> 01:29:17,891
met Betty, had a son by her.

1347
01:29:19,977 --> 01:29:22,814
But you never see where
that next punch is comin' from.

1348
01:29:25,232 --> 01:29:27,151
What do you mean?

1349
01:29:27,234 --> 01:29:30,988
Well, my son, he found out.

1350
01:29:32,323 --> 01:29:34,241
Found an old Ring magazine.

1351
01:29:34,325 --> 01:29:37,662
"You ain't Satterfield!"
That's what he said.

1352
01:29:38,871 --> 01:29:41,915
He didn't want nothin'
to do with me after that.

1353
01:29:41,999 --> 01:29:44,627
Joined a gang, got hisself killed.

1354
01:29:49,507 --> 01:29:51,634
I couldn't go back to Betty behind that.

1355
01:30:01,185 --> 01:30:04,897
Well, Tommy, I wish you would've
told all this to me before.

1356
01:30:04,981 --> 01:30:07,859
Yeah.
I give you the man you wanted.

1357
01:30:09,777 --> 01:30:12,738
You-You said you wanted your shot.

1358
01:30:12,821 --> 01:30:15,492
That's what you said to me, remember?

1359
01:30:25,543 --> 01:30:28,880
My father left me when I was a little kid.
Did I ever tell you that?

1360
01:30:28,922 --> 01:30:31,925
- Not that I recall, no.
- Yeah, well, he did.

1361
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:35,303
He left me and my mom.

1362
01:30:38,389 --> 01:30:40,516
They were never really right
for each other.

1363
01:30:42,561 --> 01:30:45,730
He was a lot older than she was,
and...

1364
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:51,236
He left.

1365
01:30:51,278 --> 01:30:54,155
The only thing I really remember is...

1366
01:30:54,239 --> 01:30:57,158
it made my mom cry.

1367
01:30:57,241 --> 01:31:00,870
He never called. He never wrote.

1368
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:07,251
And I hate him for it.

1369
01:31:09,463 --> 01:31:12,215
And I didn't run wild like your boy.

1370
01:31:17,595 --> 01:31:19,514
I just...

1371
01:31:19,598 --> 01:31:22,143
thought I would try and be
a better father to my son.

1372
01:31:23,185 --> 01:31:25,438
Try and be a hero to him.

1373
01:31:28,983 --> 01:31:31,443
'Cause every kid wants to think
his father's the best, right?

1374
01:31:31,484 --> 01:31:33,445
Yeah, that's right.

1375
01:31:36,281 --> 01:31:38,199
So, what you gonna do now?

1376
01:31:41,870 --> 01:31:44,664
Uh...

1377
01:31:44,748 --> 01:31:49,212
In about an hour I gotta go over
to my kid's school and...

1378
01:31:49,295 --> 01:31:51,213
Career Day.

1379
01:31:51,297 --> 01:31:53,632
Career Day? What's that?

1380
01:31:53,674 --> 01:31:57,094
Well, I'm gonna tell a bunch of six-year-olds
what it means to be a journalist.

1381
01:31:57,136 --> 01:32:01,056
- Oh, irony!
- Yeah. Exactly.

1382
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:09,189
You, uh, think
she'll take me back, let me in?

1383
01:32:12,234 --> 01:32:14,820
I don't know, Champ,
but I think you gotta try.

1384
01:32:14,904 --> 01:32:17,323
I gotta think on what to say.

1385
01:32:19,157 --> 01:32:21,786
I don't think you have to
say anything. Just go in.

1386
01:32:27,333 --> 01:32:30,961
Just for the record,
that thing about Marciano...

1387
01:32:31,045 --> 01:32:33,590
That's the truth.
I was his sparring partner.

1388
01:32:33,673 --> 01:32:36,008
Busted his nose.

1389
01:32:36,049 --> 01:32:38,845
- Not the big bone, but the little one.
- Yeah.

1390
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,295
My dad's name is Erik Kernan Jr.

1391
01:33:12,378 --> 01:33:15,548
He writes for newspapers.
And he's also on Showtime.

1392
01:33:15,632 --> 01:33:18,135
My dad's been up for the Pu-
the "Publitzer."

1393
01:33:18,218 --> 01:33:20,219
- Pulitzer.
- The Pulitzer.

1394
01:33:20,302 --> 01:33:23,597
Meaning that he's one
of the best writers in America.

1395
01:33:23,681 --> 01:33:27,811
My dad writes about boxing
'cause he can't write about football...

1396
01:33:27,895 --> 01:33:31,982
'cause he's, like,
best friends with John Elway...

1397
01:33:32,065 --> 01:33:34,442
and, uh, Coach Shanahan.

1398
01:33:34,525 --> 01:33:36,862
He even plays golf with Muhammad Ali.

1399
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:40,490
And he turned down, like,
being a guy on Monday Night Football.

1400
01:33:40,574 --> 01:33:44,118
- And also-
- Teddy, why don't we ask your dad to come up?

1401
01:33:44,202 --> 01:33:45,912
Okay. Dad?

1402
01:33:56,006 --> 01:34:00,010
- Hi, kids.
- Hi.

1403
01:34:00,093 --> 01:34:04,681
Um, I g-
I suppose we should just, uh...

1404
01:34:04,764 --> 01:34:06,808
ask you if you have any questions.

1405
01:34:11,563 --> 01:34:15,985
- Okay. Yeah?
- Who's better at golf, you or Muhammad Ali?

1406
01:34:16,068 --> 01:34:18,194
Um...

1407
01:34:19,363 --> 01:34:22,240
Uh, well, why don't we, uh...

1408
01:34:22,282 --> 01:34:25,619
Maybe we'd be better served
if we just talked about...

1409
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:27,621
what it means to be a journalist.

1410
01:34:27,705 --> 01:34:30,457
How about that?
Go ahead. Yeah.

1411
01:34:30,499 --> 01:34:34,128
- Are you gonna change your last name?
- Change my name?

1412
01:34:34,211 --> 01:34:37,882
My dad said you should change your last name
because you don't deserve it.

1413
01:34:37,965 --> 01:34:41,302
He says your dad was really great
and stuff, and you're a faker.

1414
01:34:41,343 --> 01:34:44,305
On the TV, they said you made up
a story about a boxer.

1415
01:34:44,388 --> 01:34:46,391
Uh, kids...

1416
01:34:46,474 --> 01:34:48,643
maybe Mr. Kernan can explain to us...

1417
01:34:48,726 --> 01:34:52,021
how fast he has to turn in a story
after the sporting event has ended.

1418
01:34:56,316 --> 01:34:58,486
That's a very good question.

1419
01:34:58,569 --> 01:35:03,992
Usually I'll turn in a story about two hours
after I see the event, because, um...

1420
01:35:05,992 --> 01:35:07,912
I wish I were dead.

1421
01:35:08,996 --> 01:35:11,749
He's six. He'll bounce back.

1422
01:35:15,586 --> 01:35:18,130
Look, this boy, he loves you.

1423
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:23,929
He knows that you're not a liar.
He- He believes in you.

1424
01:35:24,012 --> 01:35:27,849
He'll be home in an hour.
Why don't you come by and talk to him?

1425
01:35:34,356 --> 01:35:36,483
I can't.

1426
01:35:37,609 --> 01:35:39,861
I gotta go
to that settlement conference.

1427
01:35:40,861 --> 01:35:42,864
Round out a perfect day.

1428
01:35:45,909 --> 01:35:48,495
But I'll be fine.

1429
01:35:48,579 --> 01:35:50,538
I'll be fantastic.

1430
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:55,127
They really broke the mold with me, huh?

1431
01:35:58,171 --> 01:36:00,298
Bob Satterfield
was not simply a great boxer.

1432
01:36:00,382 --> 01:36:03,009
He was an icon-
truly an American icon.

1433
01:36:03,093 --> 01:36:05,095
And to have his name
brought into disrepute...

1434
01:36:05,179 --> 01:36:08,348
Okay, but that's not the issue.
I mean, you can't libel the dead.

1435
01:36:08,432 --> 01:36:11,894
Riley, we're embarrassed by what happened.
We'll print a retraction.

1436
01:36:11,977 --> 01:36:13,979
Nobody reads retractions.
You know that.

1437
01:36:14,062 --> 01:36:16,106
They read the lie, the lie sticks.

1438
01:36:16,189 --> 01:36:19,567
Look. Mr. Kernan is here
to offer his profound apologies...

1439
01:36:19,651 --> 01:36:22,071
to you and your family,
Mr. Satterfield.

1440
01:36:25,198 --> 01:36:27,117
Erik.

1441
01:36:30,036 --> 01:36:33,039
I'm responsible, Mr. Satterfield.

1442
01:36:34,916 --> 01:36:37,252
I was careless.

1443
01:36:38,586 --> 01:36:41,589
And worse than that...

1444
01:36:41,673 --> 01:36:44,426
after the story ran,
I had reason to believe...

1445
01:36:44,510 --> 01:36:47,137
that it was wrong,
and I didn't speak up.

1446
01:36:48,471 --> 01:36:50,933
I know that I can't undo the damage...

1447
01:36:52,183 --> 01:36:54,102
but I'd like to try.

1448
01:36:54,186 --> 01:36:56,522
Try in what way?

1449
01:36:56,606 --> 01:36:58,940
The only way that I know how.
I'd write about it.

1450
01:36:59,023 --> 01:37:00,943
And say what?

1451
01:37:01,026 --> 01:37:03,488
I'd say that I made a mistake.
I'd say why.

1452
01:37:03,571 --> 01:37:05,613
That...

1453
01:37:05,697 --> 01:37:09,200
I'd talk about your father.
I'd talk about who he really was.

1454
01:37:09,284 --> 01:37:11,161
Let's talk about damages,
Miss Perlmutter.

1455
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:15,874
Bob Satterfield was a great figure
in American sports.

1456
01:37:15,957 --> 01:37:18,377
Nah, he wasn't none of that.

1457
01:37:21,463 --> 01:37:24,800
He a pretty good boxer
with a glass jaw.

1458
01:37:27,303 --> 01:37:29,429
But he was a very good man.

1459
01:37:30,974 --> 01:37:34,310
And a good father, and I'd-
I'd like for people to know that.

1460
01:37:34,393 --> 01:37:36,395
Would you put that in your story?

1461
01:37:36,478 --> 01:37:39,357
I would. I would.

1462
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:42,652
When you called me, I hung up on you.

1463
01:37:42,735 --> 01:37:46,280
You said you was Erik Kernan.
You didn't say that you was a "Junior."

1464
01:37:47,824 --> 01:37:50,744
Your old man hit my dad
with some pretty big shots in his time.

1465
01:37:54,831 --> 01:37:57,667
I'd like to read your story.

1466
01:37:57,751 --> 01:38:00,669
I think it'd go a long way
in making me satisfied.

1467
01:38:24,945 --> 01:38:27,363
Jesus Christ, I get it already!

1468
01:38:43,546 --> 01:38:45,799
Hey. I've been trying to reach you.

1469
01:38:45,883 --> 01:38:48,509
I know. I, uh...

1470
01:38:50,887 --> 01:38:53,848
Did you hear about the deal?
I'm gonna write this...

1471
01:38:53,932 --> 01:38:55,476
Yeah, I-I heard.

1472
01:38:57,227 --> 01:38:59,854
Is Teddy awake?

1473
01:38:59,938 --> 01:39:02,316
He says he's not feeling well...

1474
01:39:02,399 --> 01:39:06,028
and, uh, he doesn't want
to go to school tomorrow.

1475
01:39:06,111 --> 01:39:10,657
Can I speak with him? Could I come in?
I really need to talk to him.

1476
01:39:11,866 --> 01:39:13,785
Yeah.

1477
01:39:24,546 --> 01:39:27,799
Hey, buddy. Hey, man.

1478
01:39:29,008 --> 01:39:30,927
Daddy?

1479
01:39:31,011 --> 01:39:32,929
Hey.

1480
01:39:38,477 --> 01:39:40,687
Are the kids in your class
giving you a hard time?

1481
01:39:43,608 --> 01:39:46,192
Yeah.

1482
01:39:46,276 --> 01:39:49,863
Everybody says
you made it up about Champ.

1483
01:39:53,450 --> 01:39:55,578
I made some mistakes, Teddy.

1484
01:39:58,372 --> 01:40:00,374
I made a lot of mistakes.

1485
01:40:01,542 --> 01:40:03,961
But did you make it up?

1486
01:40:06,296 --> 01:40:08,215
The truth is...

1487
01:40:10,843 --> 01:40:12,845
I wrote what Champ told me.

1488
01:40:14,305 --> 01:40:16,556
I believed him.

1489
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:18,767
But I shouldn't have. I...

1490
01:40:18,893 --> 01:40:22,104
I was more interested
in writing what I wanted the story to be...

1491
01:40:22,188 --> 01:40:24,274
than what it actually was.

1492
01:40:24,315 --> 01:40:26,317
You know? The truth.

1493
01:40:28,361 --> 01:40:31,615
I burned you, buddy. I'm sorry.

1494
01:40:31,698 --> 01:40:33,991
It's okay.

1495
01:40:37,494 --> 01:40:40,747
Not about all this...

1496
01:40:40,831 --> 01:40:44,920
but, in general...

1497
01:40:45,003 --> 01:40:46,963
are you pretty proud of me?

1498
01:40:47,046 --> 01:40:49,257
Real proud.

1499
01:40:51,216 --> 01:40:53,177
And would you be proud of me...

1500
01:40:53,219 --> 01:40:56,723
even if I didn't have, like,
a lot of celebrity friends and stuff?

1501
01:40:56,806 --> 01:40:59,017
Like, if I wasn't a big shot?

1502
01:40:59,101 --> 01:41:03,104
Well, not as much, but pretty close.

1503
01:41:09,944 --> 01:41:13,698
Teddy, I told you a lot of things
that weren't true.

1504
01:41:13,781 --> 01:41:15,993
Like being friends
with John Elway and stuff?

1505
01:41:18,619 --> 01:41:20,538
Yeah.

1506
01:41:20,622 --> 01:41:23,333
What about playing golf
with Muhammad Ali?

1507
01:41:27,712 --> 01:41:30,799
I covered a celebrity golf tournament,
and he was playing in it.

1508
01:41:30,882 --> 01:41:35,136
But, Dad, I told everybody
you were friends with John Elway.

1509
01:41:35,219 --> 01:41:37,180
Does that mean I'm a liar too?

1510
01:41:39,433 --> 01:41:41,393
No, it doesn't.

1511
01:41:41,435 --> 01:41:44,104
It means that you trusted me...

1512
01:41:44,187 --> 01:41:46,690
and you told everybody
what I told you.

1513
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:51,236
And you should be able
to trust your dad.

1514
01:41:59,744 --> 01:42:01,663
So I'm sorry.

1515
01:42:02,830 --> 01:42:06,251
I think I should go to sleep now.

1516
01:42:06,334 --> 01:42:08,003
Hey.

1517
01:42:09,671 --> 01:42:12,715
Come here. Give me a hug.

1518
01:42:17,305 --> 01:42:19,264
You're such a good kid.

1519
01:42:33,445 --> 01:42:36,282
Hey, Champ, that you?

1520
01:42:39,785 --> 01:42:42,121
Mr. Marciano?

1521
01:42:42,204 --> 01:42:44,415
It's Rocky to you, Champ.

1522
01:42:46,584 --> 01:42:49,670
Holy smoke!
What the hell you doin' here?

1523
01:42:49,754 --> 01:42:51,631
I'm lookin' for you.

1524
01:42:53,049 --> 01:42:54,968
- Lookin' for me?
- Yeah.

1525
01:42:55,051 --> 01:42:58,596
- What for?
- I heard you're still workin' out.

1526
01:42:58,679 --> 01:43:02,892
- You're still strong.
- Oh, no, no. I'm old now.

1527
01:43:02,975 --> 01:43:05,437
Ah.! Champ, you don't look old.

1528
01:43:05,519 --> 01:43:07,729
I'm makin' a comeback.

1529
01:43:07,813 --> 01:43:10,566
Rocky Marciano, back in the ring.

1530
01:43:10,649 --> 01:43:13,319
I'm lookin' for somebody to spar with.

1531
01:43:14,695 --> 01:43:16,906
Be an honor for me
to spar with you, Rock.

1532
01:43:16,989 --> 01:43:19,075
Good. Let's get started then.

1533
01:43:19,158 --> 01:43:22,828
- Let's see if you got some of the old moves.
- Mm.

1534
01:43:22,912 --> 01:43:25,332
- Come on, Champ.
- I still got some.

1535
01:43:25,415 --> 01:43:27,958
I still got a few.

1536
01:43:28,041 --> 01:43:30,002
Well, let's see 'em then.

1537
01:43:32,339 --> 01:43:34,299
All right. Let's see.

1538
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:41,055
Oh, lookin' good, Champ.

1539
01:43:48,270 --> 01:43:51,024
Come on, Champ.

1540
01:43:53,609 --> 01:43:56,029
I don't need my friends now.

1541
01:44:02,076 --> 01:44:04,037
I'm not Bob Satterfield.

1542
01:44:04,078 --> 01:44:06,457
- Let's see what you got, Champ!
- I don't want to fight! I ain't Satterfield no more!

1543
01:44:08,666 --> 01:44:10,793
Okay. All right, all right.
You the champ.

1544
01:44:10,877 --> 01:44:12,586
You the champ. You the champ...

1545
01:44:15,048 --> 01:44:18,301
Get up, Champ.!
It's just you and me now.!

1546
01:44:21,388 --> 01:44:24,224
- All right.

1547
01:44:24,265 --> 01:44:26,267
-
- All right.

1548
01:44:33,692 --> 01:44:35,485
I'm gonna kick your ass!

1549
01:45:05,933 --> 01:45:08,186
Tommy Kincaid...

1550
01:45:08,269 --> 01:45:10,353
California Golden Gloves Champion!

1551
01:45:21,950 --> 01:45:25,536
Oh- Oh, God! Oh, God!

1552
01:45:25,619 --> 01:45:28,748
Oh, God!

1553
01:45:28,831 --> 01:45:31,626
Oh, God!

1554
01:45:52,313 --> 01:45:56,067
A writer, like a boxer...

1555
01:45:56,150 --> 01:45:59,112
must stand alone.

1556
01:45:59,195 --> 01:46:02,574
Having your words published,
like entering a ring...

1557
01:46:02,657 --> 01:46:05,117
puts your talent on display.

1558
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:07,286
And there's nowhere to hide.

1559
01:46:09,997 --> 01:46:14,960
I never intended to write a story
about myself... or my son. Or about love.

1560
01:46:15,043 --> 01:46:19,006
- Or the lies that can sometimes come from love.
- We live in thy fear...

1561
01:46:19,089 --> 01:46:22,259
I will tell you this
about the man I called Champ...

1562
01:46:22,343 --> 01:46:25,096
whom everybody called Champ.

1563
01:46:25,179 --> 01:46:29,016
He was, against all reason, my friend.

1564
01:46:31,060 --> 01:46:32,770
And he was also a liar.

1565
01:46:34,522 --> 01:46:37,191
But was that because
he was trying to make himself...

1566
01:46:37,275 --> 01:46:39,485
better than who he was?

1567
01:46:39,568 --> 01:46:42,072
Or was it because
the one force more powerful...

1568
01:46:42,155 --> 01:46:45,116
than a son wanting
the admiration of his father...

1569
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:48,036
is the father wanting
the admiration of his son?

1570
01:46:49,955 --> 01:46:52,957
Sometimes we need the help
of our imagination to achieve that status.

1571
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:57,421
For it is no easy task
being the strongest, wisest...

1572
01:46:57,504 --> 01:47:01,049
- most beloved man in all the land.
- And wow.!

1573
01:47:01,132 --> 01:47:03,468
- Tonight, the Raging Bull-
- And what is sadder...

1574
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:05,595
than that moment
when our children discover...

1575
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:08,348
that we are not the illusory
supermen we've created...

1576
01:47:08,431 --> 01:47:13,979
but rather, as Herman Melville
once wrote, "men drained of valor"?

1577
01:47:17,232 --> 01:47:20,736
...is there more news of Tommy Kincaid.

1578
01:47:20,819 --> 01:47:21,820
Erik.

1579
01:47:24,906 --> 01:47:27,242
The lies
that come from love can devastate...

1580
01:47:27,325 --> 01:47:29,745
as much as those
that come from malice.

1581
01:47:35,084 --> 01:47:37,585
- What do you think about guys like-
- Champ's legacy, I suppose...

1582
01:47:37,670 --> 01:47:39,671
is the inspiration for truth.

1583
01:47:39,755 --> 01:47:43,300
And the beauty that can emerge from it.

1584
01:47:43,384 --> 01:47:45,761
I'll tell you how to make
real strong muscles.

1585
01:47:45,844 --> 01:47:48,681
You get your thumb,
you roll up your sleeves...

1586
01:47:48,764 --> 01:47:50,849
and you blow.

1587
01:47:50,932 --> 01:47:54,686
A beauty that lets
our children admire us unconditionally.

1588
01:47:54,770 --> 01:47:56,981
- In fact, he may have...
- Love us unconditionally...

1589
01:47:59,107 --> 01:48:01,234
as I love my son...

1590
01:48:02,236 --> 01:48:04,154
- mucho grande.
- But...

1591
01:48:06,115 --> 01:48:08,074
he had a pure heart.

1592
01:48:10,077 --> 01:48:15,708
This wonderful ability to...
