1
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:17,667
<i>Well, it was an interesting time</i>
<i>in the early '90s, I guess.</i>

2
00:00:17,734 --> 00:00:22,491
<i>I mean, if you mention that time,</i>
<i>I think of a pub called The Good Mixer,</i>

3
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:28,961
<i>which was kind of where all the bands went</i>
<i>and got drunk together.</i>

4
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:31,933
<i>It started there.</i>
<i>It was a feeling of something happening.</i>

5
00:00:32,007 --> 00:00:35,269
<i>And then that kind of expanded</i>

6
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:38,848
<i>until it seemed like the whole country</i>
<i>had become that pub.</i>

7
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:40,959
<i>That's kind of what happened.</i>

8
00:00:41,031 --> 00:00:43,267
I first met Gary, I suppose, at that point

9
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,223
where his group seemed
to be doing something.

10
00:00:45,287 --> 00:00:47,359
They did a tour.

11
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:51,206
On The One did a tour
and we were the support band,

12
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:53,060
and it was kind of...

13
00:00:54,503 --> 00:00:56,292
I liked him.

14
00:00:58,662 --> 00:01:00,572
He was the only one in the group
I did like, actually.

15
00:01:00,647 --> 00:01:02,207
There was another bloke called Paul,

16
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:05,759
who was absolutely the biggest
pain in the ass I had ever met.

17
00:01:08,199 --> 00:01:10,239
Who made the band a success?

18
00:01:11,591 --> 00:01:15,301
I think Gary would disagree, but it was...
You know, it was me.

19
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:18,564
I was the driving force behind the band.

20
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:22,078
You know, while Gary would be sitting
whistling in the corner,

21
00:01:22,151 --> 00:01:25,763
thinking of riffs and stuff,
I'd be powering us forward as a unit

22
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:30,239
and basically being creative
and a manager at the same time.

23
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:33,445
I sensed that he felt very trapped.

24
00:01:34,823 --> 00:01:39,580
And he wanted to get out
and experience the world and life.

25
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:44,166
So we broke up.

26
00:01:45,702 --> 00:01:47,328
And...

27
00:01:48,582 --> 00:01:52,063
Yeah, it wasn't very long after that
that he met Dora.

28
00:01:52,455 --> 00:01:56,197
<i>He started going out with this girl</i>
<i>called Dora that I used to go out with,</i>

29
00:01:56,262 --> 00:01:59,841
and after wanting to kind of
really dislike this person

30
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:06,469
and even maybe thinking I might, you know,
hit him for going out with my ex-girlfriend,

31
00:02:06,695 --> 00:02:09,346
we ended up getting on really well,

32
00:02:09,415 --> 00:02:13,637
and I, you know, ended up really liking him.

33
00:02:13,798 --> 00:02:17,377
I see Gary all the time.
You know, I see him...

34
00:02:17,447 --> 00:02:21,505
I see him... I do, I see him a lot, but...

35
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:26,790
You know, I miss who he was, you know,
I miss... I miss that.

36
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:32,868
But I never thought
this is how he'd get famous, you know.

37
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:39,996
<i>Well, I spoke to him a while ago</i>
<i>when he moved to New York</i>

38
00:02:41,415 --> 00:02:43,487
to be with Dora, I think.

39
00:02:43,558 --> 00:02:46,592
And he rang me
and just asked me a question,

40
00:02:46,663 --> 00:02:51,649
"Do you know where John Lennon lived?"
And I said, "No."

41
00:02:53,575 --> 00:02:56,477
He knew where he lived. It was...

42
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:59,973
It was his way of telling me
that he'd gone for good.

43
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:42,397
Can you turn the heat up?

44
00:03:44,134 --> 00:03:45,541
I'm sweating.

45
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:09,540
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

46
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:16,897
<i>Okay, this is Mega-Life, "Back to School,"</i>
<i>30 seconds, version one.</i>

47
00:04:38,854 --> 00:04:41,091
Hey, is everything okay?

48
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:44,414
You've got to cut out
this artistic crap, okay?

49
00:04:44,487 --> 00:04:46,429
You're weirding out the clients.

50
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:48,899
So, what do you mean?

51
00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:50,908
- Can he hear me?
- No.

52
00:04:50,982 --> 00:04:53,535
Norman said Mega-Life
played you an acoustic piece

53
00:04:53,606 --> 00:04:54,948
so you could do a sound-alike,

54
00:04:55,015 --> 00:04:58,310
and you gave them a fucking flute solo
and some slap bass.

55
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,222
I went with my instinct.
And it wasn't slap bass.

56
00:05:01,286 --> 00:05:04,548
- Well...
- I wanted it to be original and great...

57
00:05:04,615 --> 00:05:06,622
But they don't want "great," okay?

58
00:05:06,694 --> 00:05:09,029
That's why they come to us,
that's why they come to me, okay?

59
00:05:09,095 --> 00:05:12,356
Because they know they're going to get,
you know, "fine."

60
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:15,487
Yeah, but it has to be good.

61
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:17,119
Bad is good, okay?

62
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,776
And don't use words
like "Gershwin" and "Sondheim"

63
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:22,334
because that scares the shit out of them.
They don't know what that means.

64
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:26,629
They think you're making fun of them.
Okay? They want a <i>Cheers</i> sound-alike.

65
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,609
<i>- Cheers?</i>
- Yeah.

66
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:30,467
- The TV show?
- Yeah.

67
00:05:31,175 --> 00:05:33,029
Don't, please don't do that. Don't.

68
00:05:33,095 --> 00:05:35,102
This is going to be like
the second album again, I can feel it.

69
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:36,222
I don't... Do you know...

70
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:39,361
Seriously, I don't want
any of your self-sabotaging bullshit, okay?

71
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:41,700
Just, please, make it bad.

72
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,638
- Okay.
- Yeah.

73
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,914
- Okay, I'll make it bad.
- Good.

74
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:49,726
I'll see you at dinner, okay?

75
00:05:50,758 --> 00:05:51,903
Paul Bernard.

76
00:06:01,383 --> 00:06:02,877
- Hey.
- Sorry we're late.

77
00:06:02,951 --> 00:06:04,860
That's fine. How are you?

78
00:06:04,935 --> 00:06:05,949
- How are you?
- Good.

79
00:06:06,022 --> 00:06:07,429
Nice to see you.

80
00:06:07,623 --> 00:06:08,867
Hi.

81
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,833
I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry
about Sophie and that ashram.

82
00:06:12,902 --> 00:06:15,423
Oh, it's fine. I'll just go next week.

83
00:06:15,526 --> 00:06:20,098
So, it's happening.
Paul's getting the promotion.

84
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,423
- And I'm totally flipping out.
- Mate.

85
00:06:23,494 --> 00:06:24,901
- It's official.
- What promotion?

86
00:06:24,966 --> 00:06:29,788
- They're making me a partner.
- What? That's incredible! Tell us!

87
00:06:29,926 --> 00:06:32,796
- I didn't know that was a possibility.
- I just didn't want to jinx it.

88
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:36,416
You remember the "Life is
the greatest refreshment of all" campaign?

89
00:06:36,486 --> 00:06:39,486
They're extending that for another year.
That Jerome dick has gone to Belgium.

90
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:42,242
The field is open.
Suddenly I've become indispensable.

91
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,955
- That's incredible. Congratulations.
- That is incredible.

92
00:06:46,023 --> 00:06:49,219
- Isn't it exciting?
- That is really great.

93
00:06:49,287 --> 00:06:51,229
And we're gonna get
the country house for definite.

94
00:06:51,302 --> 00:06:53,790
Terry spoke to Rob's friend,
and we're just going to do it, so...

95
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:55,869
All that stuff from the old apartment
is going straight up there.

96
00:06:55,942 --> 00:06:58,015
You can be our permanent summer guests.

97
00:06:58,087 --> 00:07:02,178
- That's incredible. Congratulations.
- I don't even know what to do with myself.

98
00:07:02,983 --> 00:07:05,219
- Let's get some champagne.
- Well done.

99
00:07:05,286 --> 00:07:07,075
You can have the two Andys
make you that gazebo.

100
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:09,925
Well done.
I can't believe you didn't tell me that.

101
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,805
- I want Christmas in the new house.
- Yes...

102
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:37,414
Have you ever thought of talking to Paul
about being part of the agency?

103
00:07:38,182 --> 00:07:41,052
- You know, maybe that could be...
- Why do you say that?

104
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:43,843
I don't want to do that.
I've never wanted to do anything like that.

105
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:46,016
I know. I just... I don't know...

106
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:50,145
Does it really seem like scoring commercials
and doing it only halfway is really working?

107
00:07:50,214 --> 00:07:52,319
I thought you liked my stuff.

108
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:56,252
I do. I think you're incredibly talented.
I just...

109
00:07:56,326 --> 00:08:00,549
It doesn't seem like half-assing it
is really working for you.

110
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:03,298
I just...
I just want you to be happy, you know?

111
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:05,505
I mean, either do it or don't.

112
00:08:06,343 --> 00:08:10,336
Everything is with an eye
toward film composition, documentaries.

113
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,868
I have to start somewhere.

114
00:08:11,942 --> 00:08:14,211
Start? You've been doing it for seven years.

115
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,318
- Ever since the band broke up.
- Well...

116
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,456
I'm just saying, you know,
I liked the guy who was writing songs.

117
00:08:19,526 --> 00:08:22,756
Maybe it was because it was after the group
and you had something to prove.

118
00:08:22,823 --> 00:08:26,019
But now it's just like,
if you're going to give up,

119
00:08:26,086 --> 00:08:28,094
you might as well
go teach music in the inner city.

120
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,857
One thing. One thing. I haven't given up.
All right?

121
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,999
Secondly, are you telling me that
that is my choice?

122
00:08:32,071 --> 00:08:35,486
To either teach music in the inner city
or go and work for the agency?

123
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,414
I'm just saying
you're basically doing it anyway,

124
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:38,689
so why not just commit?

125
00:08:38,758 --> 00:08:42,719
What about working in an art gallery
is so good for the world, Dora?

126
00:08:45,511 --> 00:08:47,932
You know,
I knew my artistic limitations, okay?

127
00:08:48,006 --> 00:08:50,275
- That's what we're getting to.
- I'm not saying you're limited.

128
00:08:50,342 --> 00:08:52,611
I'm just saying I dealt with it.

129
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:55,068
You know, if you want to do this
for the rest of your life, that's fine.

130
00:08:55,142 --> 00:08:58,371
Okay? Be my guest.
But you can't ask me to respect it.

131
00:08:58,439 --> 00:08:59,845
- Or support it.
- Okay.

132
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:04,133
And you know what? You're so sensitive,
you think everything is an attack.

133
00:09:20,742 --> 00:09:23,109
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

134
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:27,042
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings before.

135
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,276
No, it's okay. You're right.

136
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,179
I'm taking off my watch,

137
00:10:01,255 --> 00:10:05,411
so you're supposed to
take off your street shoes.

138
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:09,501
They said cords were okay.

139
00:10:11,303 --> 00:10:14,150
Don't worry.

140
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:17,476
I think you look perfect.

141
00:10:18,214 --> 00:10:19,491
Thank you.

142
00:10:21,894 --> 00:10:23,105
I'm Gary.

143
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:27,905
A pleasure.

144
00:10:30,182 --> 00:10:33,695
If you pay close attention

145
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,516
and close your eyes

146
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:41,055
you can feel a heartbeat in my lips.

147
00:10:43,782 --> 00:10:47,044
You can't feel it like that.

148
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,634
Can you be here at 6:00
to let the guys in to fix the drain?

149
00:10:57,702 --> 00:10:58,749
Yeah.

150
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,130
- Have a good day.
- Thanks.

151
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:13,508
This time could we just hear
a bit of the original please?

152
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:15,614
Thank you.

153
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,172
Wanna do something fun
for dinner tomorrow night?

154
00:11:27,782 --> 00:11:29,986
- Yeah, like what?
- I don't know.

155
00:11:30,726 --> 00:11:33,825
Anyone you want to see?
Any place you want to go?

156
00:11:36,454 --> 00:11:37,981
I don't know.

157
00:11:38,054 --> 00:11:41,121
I'll think of something fun. I'll surprise you.

158
00:11:42,182 --> 00:11:43,360
You shouldn't have said anything.

159
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,245
- We don't have to.
- No, I want to.

160
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,357
Okay.

161
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:07,811
- Are you going to read for a long time?
- I'm just going to finish this chapter.

162
00:12:08,966 --> 00:12:10,788
I have to get up early.

163
00:12:12,646 --> 00:12:13,856
Okay.

164
00:12:17,894 --> 00:12:19,552
- Love you.
- Me, too.

165
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,542
Hello.

166
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,994
I'm so excited to see you again.

167
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:47,266
Could you please tell me your name?

168
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:49,436
I'm Anna.

169
00:12:49,863 --> 00:12:51,073
I'm Gary.

170
00:12:55,302 --> 00:12:56,764
How are you?

171
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,517
I'm fine, Gary.

172
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,445
I'm all for you.

173
00:13:11,526 --> 00:13:12,803
Fuck it.

174
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:14,912
Fuck it!

175
00:13:16,358 --> 00:13:19,904
- What is it? Are you okay?
- Just had a nightmare.

176
00:13:21,318 --> 00:13:24,100
- About what?
- I don't know.

177
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:30,626
I was blind and lost,
or drowning or something.

178
00:13:31,302 --> 00:13:34,498
- Try to relax.
- Rats were eating my pillow.

179
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:41,566
For you.

180
00:14:41,638 --> 00:14:43,165
For you.

181
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,695
For you.

182
00:14:45,766 --> 00:14:48,668
For you. For you. For you.

183
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,365
For you.

184
00:14:56,262 --> 00:15:00,004
- Don't come in, I'm in here!
- What?

185
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,281
I was just...

186
00:15:01,382 --> 00:15:03,138
- Oh, my God.
- What?

187
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,918
It's 7:00 in the morning.
Do you know how weird that is?

188
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,081
- Well, sometimes I just... You know?
- This is so sad.

189
00:15:12,518 --> 00:15:14,405
You're a fucked-up person.

190
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,569
Dora, listen, I don't... Christ, I don't know...

191
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:23,259
You have problems.
Make sure you scrub out the sink.

192
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,370
Gary? Gary? Are you here?

193
00:15:35,238 --> 00:15:36,613
Gazo!

194
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,572
Hey, mate. Have you seen her yet?

195
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,249
- Here she is! No. Have you seen her?
- No.

196
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:48,547
She's, like, sort of tall and hot,
in a kind of short, ugly way.

197
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,818
Paul, why is she coming here?
You're such an idiot.

198
00:15:50,886 --> 00:15:52,828
Someone's going to see you.
What if Terry finds out?

199
00:15:52,902 --> 00:15:55,073
- Then it's curtains, isn't it?
- Exactly. How can it be worth it?

200
00:15:55,142 --> 00:15:57,695
What are you talking about, worth it?
It's like being on tour again.

201
00:15:57,766 --> 00:15:58,748
She wants to be a gymnast.

202
00:15:58,822 --> 00:16:00,993
Have you any idea
how flexible those chicks can get?

203
00:16:01,062 --> 00:16:03,909
- A gymnast? What is she, 11 years old?
- That's what I said to her!

204
00:16:03,974 --> 00:16:05,381
I said,
"Your tits are too big to be a gymnast."

205
00:16:05,446 --> 00:16:08,675
Because they've got to be flat
and, like, super Chinese, you know?

206
00:16:08,742 --> 00:16:10,432
Why are we in a fucking hobbit hole?

207
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,444
We're not in a hobbit hole.
I'm just checking some things out.

208
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:13,925
Don't touch my books.

209
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,379
Listen, do you have a lot of dreams?

210
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:18,756
- What does that mean?
- Well, do you have dreams?

211
00:16:18,822 --> 00:16:21,604
Like, I don't know, dreams that, when
you're sleeping, that you have one night,

212
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,256
and then the next night you have it again.
I don't mean the same dream,

213
00:16:24,326 --> 00:16:27,359
but say, one closely related
to the one you had before?

214
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,918
Well, I don't know, probably.
I don't really remember my dreams.

215
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,673
Unless I leave a little something in my PJ's,
if you know what I'm saying.

216
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:33,821
Well, yeah. This is...

217
00:16:33,894 --> 00:16:37,026
These are all PJ dreams,
but without the "leaving something."

218
00:16:37,094 --> 00:16:39,134
I've had a couple of them and they just...
They were amazing.

219
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:41,988
I just thought I'd find out about it.

220
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,263
Okay, well, now you come to mention it,

221
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:46,116
I did have a dream once
where I killed a man,

222
00:16:46,182 --> 00:16:48,385
which is pretty cool.

223
00:16:48,454 --> 00:16:49,697
And I fucked my mother.

224
00:16:49,765 --> 00:16:50,780
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

225
00:16:50,854 --> 00:16:53,123
No, I'm not. But it was sick. I didn't enjoy it.
Yes, I did.

226
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,005
Look, don't tell Dora I said that
because that's, like, bad.

227
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,412
That is bad.

228
00:16:58,438 --> 00:16:59,420
- There she is.
- This her?

229
00:16:59,494 --> 00:17:00,901
Yeah, she's waiting for me.

230
00:17:03,078 --> 00:17:05,795
- Hey. Hey, how're you doing?
- Hi.

231
00:17:05,862 --> 00:17:06,844
- Don't kiss me.
- Okay.

232
00:17:06,918 --> 00:17:08,478
This is Gary. He works for me.

233
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,892
- Hi.
- Hi, Gary.

234
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,747
- You're the keyboardist?
- Yeah.

235
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:13,854
- Tica with a "T."
- Hi.

236
00:17:13,926 --> 00:17:17,471
- Oh, wow. I'm just such a big fan.
- Oh, thank you.

237
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:20,226
She is, honestly. She knows all the words
to <i>Checkpoint Carlos.</i>

238
00:17:20,294 --> 00:17:22,879
She likes to hum it when we're in bed.

239
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,750
Do you like any of the other songs?

240
00:17:35,014 --> 00:17:37,283
<i>Checkpoint Carlos</i> is really
one of my favorite ones.

241
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,489
We should get the hell out of here
because we've got stuff to do.

242
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,241
You make up those changes
and call my assistant,

243
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,903
- because she'll know where I am, okay?
- All right.

244
00:17:43,974 --> 00:17:45,381
- Take it easy.
- Don't slap it.

245
00:17:45,445 --> 00:17:46,755
Whatever, let's rock.

246
00:17:47,878 --> 00:17:48,990
Excuse me?

247
00:17:49,062 --> 00:17:53,055
Can you tell me, do these books tell you
what your dreams mean?

248
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:56,060
Yeah. Yeah, those books will tell you
everything you need to know.

249
00:17:56,134 --> 00:17:57,727
But see this book right here?

250
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:01,311
I mean, this book will tell you shit
you didn't even want to know.

251
00:18:01,382 --> 00:18:06,084
I mean, because, like, Alan Weigert's like
the John Grisham of lucid dreaming.

252
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,157
All right. Of what, sorry?

253
00:18:09,414 --> 00:18:10,908
You want a tip?

254
00:18:12,294 --> 00:18:13,276
Yeah, what?

255
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,560
You want to learn about dreams
and dreaming, right?

256
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,735
Yeah. It seems interesting, yeah.

257
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:20,893
Okay. I've got a place you should go.

258
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:22,650
Okay.

259
00:18:23,878 --> 00:18:27,194
- Everything is going to be okay, honey.
- Go on. Go on, cry your eyes out.

260
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:31,743
You're a sick human.
If it happens again, Mel, I'll call the cops.

261
00:18:31,814 --> 00:18:34,083
- They were egging me on, man.
- They're children, for God's sake.

262
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,841
- You know how dark kids can be?
- No, I don't.

263
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,463
Little horrible adults in tiny bodies.
I didn't do anything.

264
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:43,007
I heard you, Mel. You can't call
a seven-year-old girl a vapid narcissist.

265
00:18:43,078 --> 00:18:45,282
They just stand there,
staring at themselves in a mirror!

266
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,416
They're supposed to be looking
in the mirror. It's part of the exercise.

267
00:18:48,486 --> 00:18:50,209
- Turn-out into <i>pas de bourée.</i>
- Don't be mad at me

268
00:18:50,277 --> 00:18:51,390
just because you hate yourself.

269
00:18:51,462 --> 00:18:53,917
- At 6:00 the room is mine.
- What? What did you say?

270
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,608
- You heard me.
- There is always going to be some overlap.

271
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:59,198
It's a small room.
We're trying to make it work.

272
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:01,604
Listen, you speak to one of my girls
like that again,

273
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,230
there will be consequences.

274
00:19:03,302 --> 00:19:05,506
- Meanie!
- Lolita!

275
00:19:05,926 --> 00:19:07,453
See, honey? Just like my father.

276
00:19:07,526 --> 00:19:10,908
- Anabella, did you bring the Jell-O?
- You said pudding on Tuesday.

277
00:19:10,982 --> 00:19:13,600
- Hi.
- Yo, my man! Karate's at 7:00.

278
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:16,801
No, no. I'm here for the dreaming.
This is the lucid dreaming group?

279
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,244
- Yeah.
- Great.

280
00:19:21,318 --> 00:19:25,409
Unhappy with your life?
Looking for some control?

281
00:19:25,893 --> 00:19:27,104
Maybe, yeah.

282
00:19:28,294 --> 00:19:29,952
Let's get to it, people!

283
00:19:30,982 --> 00:19:34,178
- All right, Constance and Bomba?
- Yeah?

284
00:19:34,246 --> 00:19:36,667
You team. Rita and Shiraz, you hook up.

285
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:41,019
Come on. Get in, get in, get in. Look at it.
Check it out. Open up. Open up for him.

286
00:19:41,157 --> 00:19:44,059
Yoshi, Sherry, you do that, you pair up.

287
00:19:49,478 --> 00:19:52,325
...like, through the rooms,
and there was all these people.

288
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,626
People are in there, you know?

289
00:19:54,886 --> 00:19:58,716
And then, the thing about it is, you know...

290
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:03,394
Look, you don't want to read
any of those books by Alan Weigert.

291
00:20:03,462 --> 00:20:05,633
- Really? Why not? They seem pretty good.
- They're illusion.

292
00:20:05,702 --> 00:20:08,997
They should be in the fiction section.
He's a sellout.

293
00:20:09,286 --> 00:20:14,436
What you want are hard-hitting facts.
What you need is the truth.

294
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:18,596
I wrote it myself. Begin at Chapter 1.

295
00:20:19,461 --> 00:20:23,040
You gotta look at your hands
just before you go to sleep. That's the thing.

296
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,932
That's the biggest thing in a lucid dream.

297
00:20:24,998 --> 00:20:30,694
You gotta, you know, study each line
and crack and imperfection.

298
00:20:30,886 --> 00:20:34,563
Gotta get a long-lasting impression
in your mind,

299
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,564
because they are your safety blanket
in the dream state.

300
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:40,322
In case the nightmare begins

301
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:44,001
or some stressful event
creates a dream monster,

302
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:48,193
you have to use this technique to stop it
while you're still sleeping.

303
00:20:48,261 --> 00:20:52,004
- Otherwise, you'll wake up...
- Sorry, did you say "dream monster"?

304
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,979
- Yeah.
- You're kidding.

305
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:59,008
No. It's like getting shot, falling down,
or being chased around,

306
00:20:59,078 --> 00:21:02,722
all the classic side effects
of a dream monster.

307
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,124
- So it's not like a real monster?
- Could be.

308
00:21:05,189 --> 00:21:09,118
To some people, it's a feeling
that knocks them out of the dream.

309
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:13,120
For others, it's a giant Muppet.
It's different for everybody.

310
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,451
And the thing about when you go to sleep,
you fall asleep,

311
00:21:16,518 --> 00:21:19,616
as soon as you do,
you look for light switches, right?

312
00:21:19,685 --> 00:21:23,460
You turn them on and off, inside,
indoor light switches, to see what happens.

313
00:21:23,525 --> 00:21:26,973
If you find a mirror or you look in a mirror,
it's very good.

314
00:21:27,046 --> 00:21:29,118
If you already know
what you want your dream to be about,

315
00:21:29,189 --> 00:21:32,059
then how can you get that going?
Is that possible?

316
00:21:32,134 --> 00:21:35,003
Well, that's in Chapter 7,
but don't skip around

317
00:21:35,078 --> 00:21:38,242
because there's a math to it.

318
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:43,547
Yo! Karate chop! What the fuck?
Knock, knock. I got two more minutes.

319
00:21:43,622 --> 00:21:46,110
- Go wait outside.
- They have swords.

320
00:21:46,661 --> 00:21:48,930
Every week, these fucking warmongers...

321
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:53,602
It's a full-on emotional exploration.

322
00:21:54,405 --> 00:21:59,108
It's not dangerous,
but sometimes it's emotionally alarming.

323
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,296
Just a preparation, okay? Read the book.

324
00:22:03,366 --> 00:22:06,814
Okay? That's it. Not that guy. Not...
Not the Weigert guy.

325
00:22:06,885 --> 00:22:11,708
All right, everybody, let's go. That's good.
That's enough for today.

326
00:22:11,781 --> 00:22:12,643
She okay?

327
00:22:13,701 --> 00:22:19,233
When I first met Mel in 1962 at Berkeley,
I was at MIT.

328
00:22:19,494 --> 00:22:22,309
My father said,
"Never go to California, it's full of shit."

329
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:26,269
Because he was a pilot, he was
convinced that the United States were tilted

330
00:22:26,342 --> 00:22:30,782
and all the crap, dirt and filth
slid towards California, Berkeley.

331
00:22:30,854 --> 00:22:32,315
He said, "Never go there."

332
00:22:32,389 --> 00:22:36,764
I went there
and I did find that filthy hell hole

333
00:22:36,837 --> 00:22:40,001
full of stupid hippies,
but I enjoyed myself there.

334
00:22:40,069 --> 00:22:42,971
That's when I first met Mel, yeah.

335
00:22:43,846 --> 00:22:45,406
He belonged there.

336
00:23:13,765 --> 00:23:15,587
What are you doing in there?
Are you on the toilet?

337
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:18,272
Yeah, I'll... I'll be done in a minute.

338
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:20,164
Turn the fan on.

339
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,564
I wish you had waited
till I got ready for bed.

340
00:23:22,629 --> 00:23:25,499
Sorry. Sorry. I'm almost finished.

341
00:23:25,574 --> 00:23:28,029
Are you in there
playing with yourself again?

342
00:23:29,606 --> 00:23:31,231
Light a match.

343
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,274
Love you.

344
00:24:12,837 --> 00:24:14,047
Me, too.

345
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:23,811
I thought I'd never see you again.

346
00:25:25,797 --> 00:25:27,007
I'm here.

347
00:25:33,606 --> 00:25:35,940
Will you make love to me?

348
00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:37,020
Yes.

349
00:25:38,021 --> 00:25:40,093
All day long?

350
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:41,889
Of course.

351
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:45,253
- Even after it hurts too much to continue?
- Anything.

352
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,019
Can we make babies?

353
00:25:53,158 --> 00:25:54,783
I'm just kidding.

354
00:26:01,702 --> 00:26:02,945
Remember...

355
00:26:03,845 --> 00:26:07,642
Everything you need to make it great
is in you.

356
00:26:11,365 --> 00:26:12,445
Look at your hands, quick!

357
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,299
What's up?

358
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:20,805
Sorry, nothing. It's just the same old stuff.

359
00:27:09,797 --> 00:27:12,667
- Gary?
- In the bedroom! Wait one second.

360
00:27:12,742 --> 00:27:15,360
I just saw Angel. He said
they're going to redo the entire lobby.

361
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,317
- Oh, wait.
- What are you doing?

362
00:27:17,381 --> 00:27:19,389
Look, I'm sorry about the mess, okay?
I'll have that cleaned up.

363
00:27:19,462 --> 00:27:21,567
You know,
I've not been sleeping or anything.

364
00:27:21,638 --> 00:27:24,507
So I just thought the best thing
would be to get it really quiet.

365
00:27:24,581 --> 00:27:26,272
Wait, wait. This looks totally horrible.

366
00:27:26,342 --> 00:27:29,822
That siren last night was so loud,
I was screwed.

367
00:27:29,893 --> 00:27:32,576
- I was like a zombie at work today.
- I called you at work. You weren't there.

368
00:27:32,645 --> 00:27:35,962
Yeah. I cut out early to get this stuff set up.

369
00:27:36,038 --> 00:27:38,459
Don't you think it's a good idea?
I mean, we'll sleep so much better.

370
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:41,151
- I sleep fine.
- It'll be good. Trust me.

371
00:27:41,221 --> 00:27:43,938
Gary, this is insanely inconsiderate.

372
00:27:44,005 --> 00:27:47,234
I can't believe you've done this
without even consulting me.

373
00:27:47,302 --> 00:27:49,603
Now we're going to breathe in all this foam?
It can't be good for you.

374
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:52,452
It's full of chloro-fluorocarbons or whatever.

375
00:27:52,518 --> 00:27:54,143
Dora, I'm doing this for you, too.

376
00:27:54,213 --> 00:27:56,101
I'm going to tidy up.
You won't even know it's there.

377
00:27:56,165 --> 00:28:00,027
This is crazy.
Don't they at least make it in white?

378
00:28:41,893 --> 00:28:43,300
What are you doing?

379
00:28:43,781 --> 00:28:46,083
Jesus Christ, Gary, I'm reading.
What's wrong with you?

380
00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:48,222
What's wrong with me?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

381
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:49,952
Why are you doing this to me?

382
00:28:50,021 --> 00:28:51,297
Are you having nightmares again?

383
00:28:51,365 --> 00:28:55,260
I mean, basically, but I still want to sleep.
Jesus, Dora!

384
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,635
You're kidding me.
Can't you read in the other room?

385
00:28:57,701 --> 00:28:59,228
- This is so fucking rude.
- I get scared in there alone.

386
00:28:59,301 --> 00:29:02,465
Oh, you get scared. Jesus.
It's the living room.

387
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:05,850
Why can't you be nice to me?
I don't feel well. I take care of you.

388
00:29:05,926 --> 00:29:08,227
- Okay, what's wrong with you then?
- I've got a tickle in my throat.

389
00:29:08,293 --> 00:29:10,749
Jesus Christ!
What do you want me to do about it?

390
00:29:10,821 --> 00:29:14,618
You're a real jerk, you know that?
I would never do this to you.

391
00:29:14,693 --> 00:29:18,687
I hope you have terrifying nightmares.
I hope you shit your pants.

392
00:29:21,989 --> 00:29:23,233
I'm sorry.

393
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:26,528
I'm sorry, I love you.

394
00:29:33,221 --> 00:29:35,676
Here they are. Hi, guys.

395
00:29:35,749 --> 00:29:37,571
- Sorry, we're...
- Hi.

396
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:44,804
Is everything all right?

397
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:49,214
- Terry!
- Terry!

398
00:29:51,493 --> 00:29:53,762
What's that all about?

399
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,804
She broke into my e-mail, okay?

400
00:29:55,877 --> 00:30:00,034
She found a letter from that girl
who I've been seeing a little bit.

401
00:30:00,101 --> 00:30:02,468
Tica with a "T"? Oh, my God!

402
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:05,216
It was just kind of...
It was regular kind of girl shit, you know?

403
00:30:05,285 --> 00:30:07,554
But then she added this fantasy
where she kind of ended up

404
00:30:07,622 --> 00:30:09,956
with me breaking her arm
and knocking a couple of her teeth out!

405
00:30:10,021 --> 00:30:12,868
Which is fine, that's fine, you know?
But when your wife reads it,

406
00:30:12,933 --> 00:30:15,583
you realize that, you know, it's wrong.

407
00:30:16,101 --> 00:30:19,167
- Well, this is serious!
- Is it? I don't know, you know.

408
00:30:19,237 --> 00:30:21,277
I thought I'd be more frightened
of Terry leaving.

409
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:24,513
But it's kind of like...
It's like an exciting prospect.

410
00:30:24,581 --> 00:30:27,331
You know, I'm kind of a bit of a hotshot
at work at the moment, you know?

411
00:30:27,397 --> 00:30:29,502
It's like I haven't felt like this
since the band.

412
00:30:29,573 --> 00:30:31,035
It's like being on tour, you know?

413
00:30:31,109 --> 00:30:33,760
Women kind of look at me differently.
I don't know.

414
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:35,356
I'm just going to see how things go,
you know?

415
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:37,534
In the meantime,
I wish she would just shut up

416
00:30:37,605 --> 00:30:40,736
and go to her mother's
because I'm just, you know...

417
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:42,619
What's wrong with you? You look terrible.

418
00:30:42,693 --> 00:30:45,278
My sleeping's all screwy, you know...

419
00:30:45,349 --> 00:30:47,716
Right, the dream stuff. How's that going?

420
00:30:48,901 --> 00:30:54,204
Yeah, things are very good.
I feel like an idiot saying this, but...

421
00:30:56,517 --> 00:31:01,122
I have this girl and she's amazing.
I mean, she loves me.

422
00:31:01,189 --> 00:31:04,963
She's passionate and supportive
and inspiring.

423
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,574
I don't know, like I said,
I feel like an idiot saying this, but...

424
00:31:08,645 --> 00:31:11,679
I don't know, I just... I just...

425
00:31:12,741 --> 00:31:16,189
I read these books, right,
they teach you how to control your dreams.

426
00:31:16,261 --> 00:31:18,595
I mean, it's ridiculous, but I feel good.

427
00:31:18,661 --> 00:31:21,564
And I haven't felt good about myself
in such a long time.

428
00:31:21,637 --> 00:31:24,605
I'll tell you,
it was just like the early days with Dora.

429
00:31:24,678 --> 00:31:25,987
God, that sounds great.

430
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:28,289
That sounds so great
because there are no problems.

431
00:31:28,357 --> 00:31:29,634
You can't get caught.

432
00:31:29,701 --> 00:31:31,588
You should lend me
one of your dream books.

433
00:31:31,653 --> 00:31:33,922
- No, thanks.
- Yeah, and then I can get a dream girlfriend,

434
00:31:33,989 --> 00:31:35,712
and then we can, you know,
we can double up.

435
00:31:35,781 --> 00:31:37,472
Or better yet, we can swap.

436
00:31:38,181 --> 00:31:40,253
- I don't want to swap.
- Consider it.

437
00:31:46,021 --> 00:31:47,450
So where's Terry?

438
00:31:47,525 --> 00:31:49,794
- She's gone to her mother's.
- Yes!

439
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:53,186
I didn't...

440
00:31:59,781 --> 00:32:01,756
What did you do with the NyQuil?

441
00:32:02,085 --> 00:32:04,419
Is it not in the medicine cabinet?

442
00:32:05,797 --> 00:32:07,008
Do you want to do that?

443
00:32:07,077 --> 00:32:09,182
Do you want to have sex e-mails
with some bimbo?

444
00:32:09,253 --> 00:32:11,642
That's so fucked up.
Do you know how dark that is?

445
00:32:11,717 --> 00:32:14,784
Hold on. It was just an e-mail.
We don't know that he's cheating.

446
00:32:14,853 --> 00:32:18,148
Oh, come on. Don't do that.
Don't defend him. It's me.

447
00:32:18,213 --> 00:32:20,068
Do you think about stuff like that?

448
00:32:20,133 --> 00:32:22,173
What's thinking about something?
You know, what...

449
00:32:22,245 --> 00:32:25,660
You could say, do I think about suicide?
Well, yes, I do think about it.

450
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:28,602
Would I do it?
Well, you know, bad example...

451
00:32:28,677 --> 00:32:30,684
- Right. So you do think about it.
- No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding!

452
00:32:30,757 --> 00:32:33,212
- For Christ's sake, it's so abstract!
- The relationship is on the line.

453
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,300
- Do I think about something?
- It's depressing.

454
00:32:34,373 --> 00:32:35,966
- What do you want me to tell you?
- How about the truth?

455
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:40,259
- Okay, do you think about it?
- No, I don't, and I have a lot of opportunity.

456
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:43,107
- Sorry, what does that mean?
- Guys like me. They make it clear.

457
00:32:43,173 --> 00:32:45,507
Go fuck one of them, then. What do I care?
It's not like we do.

458
00:32:45,573 --> 00:32:48,223
I don't want to, Gary! That's the point!

459
00:32:48,709 --> 00:32:52,571
Jesus, nobody jerks off
at 7:00 in the morning

460
00:32:52,645 --> 00:32:53,954
unless they're really unhappy!

461
00:32:54,021 --> 00:32:56,476
And it's sure as shit not me
you're thinking about in there!

462
00:32:56,549 --> 00:32:58,337
I don't know how to respond to this, okay?

463
00:32:58,405 --> 00:33:02,333
Don't lump me in with Paul
because he's fucked up.

464
00:33:02,405 --> 00:33:04,641
It just seems like
we're heading in that direction

465
00:33:04,709 --> 00:33:08,637
and if we're going to end up like that,
it's better to talk about it now.

466
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:12,058
- We could have a normal conversation.
- Conversation about what?

467
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:15,035
About how I've watched more TV
in the last three years

468
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:17,280
than I have in my whole life because of you.

469
00:33:17,349 --> 00:33:20,732
We don't do anything and
you're always the depressive, you know?

470
00:33:20,805 --> 00:33:24,154
Does it ever occur to you that maybe
I need a little cheering up, you know?

471
00:33:24,229 --> 00:33:25,308
That I want to feel special?

472
00:33:25,381 --> 00:33:28,796
I don't think you do need cheering up.
I think you need tampons.

473
00:33:29,061 --> 00:33:31,395
What a response. Fuck you.

474
00:33:32,197 --> 00:33:33,441
- I'm so tired of this...
- Dora!

475
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:35,811
- I can't sit around here anymore.
- Dora! Come on, I'm sorry.

476
00:33:35,877 --> 00:33:38,081
- Go! Be messy, and go camping...
- What am I apologizing for?

477
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:41,924
...and live life and drive race cars!
- Jesus Christ, I'll just put you in a cab.

478
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:21,506
Are you okay? You look tense.

479
00:34:22,117 --> 00:34:25,598
Do I? Shit. I feel like such a liar.

480
00:34:26,405 --> 00:34:29,220
- What do you have to lie about?
- You. This.

481
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:33,891
Gary, you're a good person.
You haven't done anything wrong.

482
00:34:33,957 --> 00:34:38,691
Then why am I so anxious all the time?
Why do I feel like everything I do is bad?

483
00:34:39,749 --> 00:34:42,051
It's nice to feel the breeze on my face.

484
00:35:20,773 --> 00:35:24,897
<i>I think our relationship was</i>
<i>less complicated than his one with Dora.</i>

485
00:35:26,309 --> 00:35:31,098
But I think he was challenged
by complicated people.

486
00:35:32,229 --> 00:35:34,717
He was challenged by people
who scared him.

487
00:35:36,773 --> 00:35:38,299
<i>Dora scared him.</i>

488
00:35:46,693 --> 00:35:48,548
- Dora?
- Hi.

489
00:35:49,701 --> 00:35:52,351
Hey. What are you doing?

490
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:54,852
Ellen had to cancel her trip to Venice.

491
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:58,779
I had to decide at the last second,
but I'm going to go in her place.

492
00:35:58,853 --> 00:36:02,431
It's a big deal for me
representing the gallery over there.

493
00:36:02,501 --> 00:36:04,388
Wait, are you kidding?

494
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:07,452
This is great news,
but you didn't want to consult me?

495
00:36:07,524 --> 00:36:09,564
Why should I, Gary?

496
00:36:09,637 --> 00:36:12,768
You know, I mean, I think it's probably
the best thing that we have some time apart.

497
00:36:12,836 --> 00:36:13,949
- I'm not making you happy...
- Best thing?

498
00:36:14,021 --> 00:36:16,442
...you're not making me happy, so...
- Hang on, I'm not making you happy?

499
00:36:16,517 --> 00:36:19,070
Oh, come on.
Let's just cut the bullshit, okay?

500
00:36:19,141 --> 00:36:22,108
- This is ridiculous.
- The whole thing has just gotten totally...

501
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,759
It's just fear, you know?
I'm just afraid of being alone.

502
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:27,967
I don't want to get into the whole thing.

503
00:36:28,037 --> 00:36:30,558
I'm not saying anything official.
I just want to go and do this.

504
00:36:30,629 --> 00:36:33,825
- That's fine. But don't go like this.
- Come on.

505
00:36:34,597 --> 00:36:37,052
You and your idiot friend can do
whatever you want while I'm gone.

506
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,198
I really don't care.

507
00:36:39,269 --> 00:36:40,545
Paul has moved out of Terry's.

508
00:36:40,613 --> 00:36:43,461
I'm thinking I might stay there
for a few days when I get back.

509
00:36:43,525 --> 00:36:44,539
That's fine.

510
00:36:44,612 --> 00:36:47,646
You do whatever you have to do, all right?
But don't blame me for everything.

511
00:36:47,717 --> 00:36:50,302
I'm not blaming you, Gary!
That's the whole point.

512
00:36:50,372 --> 00:36:54,628
It's just not fun anymore.
I feel lousy about myself all the time.

513
00:36:54,693 --> 00:36:56,580
And that's how I feel.

514
00:36:56,644 --> 00:36:59,492
I can't do this today.
It makes my joints ache.

515
00:37:00,773 --> 00:37:02,628
Do you have your passport?

516
00:37:04,837 --> 00:37:06,014
Yeah.

517
00:37:06,981 --> 00:37:07,929
Okay.

518
00:37:10,149 --> 00:37:14,043
Of course that's all you have to say.
You're such a dead person.

519
00:37:14,117 --> 00:37:16,157
You're just so absent. You're so absent.

520
00:37:16,229 --> 00:37:18,084
How did you get like this?
What's wrong with you?

521
00:37:18,149 --> 00:37:21,378
- That is exactly the way you are with me.
- No, no, no, Gary.

522
00:37:21,444 --> 00:37:25,372
You don't just reciprocate the complaint,
okay? You can't throw back the same insult.

523
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:30,365
- I never do that. That's what you always do.
- Oh, Jesus Christ! Goodbye!

524
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:05,634
Think of it this way,
you've got two weeks off, right?

525
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:07,294
Dora is out of town.

526
00:38:07,365 --> 00:38:10,332
You know,
you can have wet dreams every night,

527
00:38:10,404 --> 00:38:13,022
even work on this nocturnal thing
you're developing, you know,

528
00:38:13,092 --> 00:38:16,027
and try and put it to use in the real world,
you know, in the real-life population.

529
00:38:16,101 --> 00:38:17,083
I mean...

530
00:38:17,157 --> 00:38:19,612
- What's your name, beautiful?
- Shawna.

531
00:38:19,685 --> 00:38:22,270
- And do you have a boyfriend?
- Just you, sugar.

532
00:38:23,396 --> 00:38:25,469
Correct answer. Straight A's for Shawna.

533
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:29,883
And what do you look for in a guy,
other than deep pockets and V. D?

534
00:38:29,957 --> 00:38:31,451
I like funny guys.

535
00:38:31,524 --> 00:38:35,321
Well, take my friend Gary here, okay?
Now, if he was a funny guy,

536
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:37,469
okay, and he's not by the way,
but let's pretend he is,

537
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,875
if he was a funny guy,
could he be your type?

538
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:42,177
Oh, sure.

539
00:38:42,244 --> 00:38:44,994
You know, Shawna can be inspiring.
She wants to be a singer.

540
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:47,003
- A rapper.
- Even better!

541
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:49,794
Shawna, don't you want to rock Gary's mic?

542
00:38:50,053 --> 00:38:51,165
Yeah.

543
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:55,098
Come on, Gary. Let me rock your mic.

544
00:38:57,541 --> 00:38:58,785
Okay! That's fine!

545
00:38:58,853 --> 00:39:00,380
Oh, make him stay, Shawna!

546
00:39:00,453 --> 00:39:03,835
Please, you've been great.
I'm going to call you tomorrow.

547
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:05,469
Come back, Shane.

548
00:39:32,164 --> 00:39:33,212
Anna?

549
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:36,121
Anna?

550
00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:52,672
Hey, Gary.

551
00:39:56,164 --> 00:39:59,034
Are you coming to Venice?

552
00:40:00,868 --> 00:40:03,934
You're friends with Dora, right?

553
00:40:04,004 --> 00:40:05,346
He knows her.

554
00:40:12,132 --> 00:40:15,002
Hey, Gaz. She's going to rock the mic.

555
00:40:23,877 --> 00:40:25,371
Oh, shit!

556
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,027
<i>Gary didn't fear rejection.</i>

557
00:40:28,165 --> 00:40:30,717
What Gary feared
was being a mediocre talent,

558
00:40:30,788 --> 00:40:33,788
which, to be brutally honest, he was.

559
00:40:59,461 --> 00:41:01,600
Hey, Gary! What happened to you?

560
00:41:01,669 --> 00:41:03,163
I thought you were going to be
a new addition.

561
00:41:03,237 --> 00:41:05,855
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I've just been real busy, you know?

562
00:41:05,925 --> 00:41:09,089
- Listen, do you have a minute?
- Well, I'm actually on my way to work.

563
00:41:09,157 --> 00:41:13,946
- So, if you want to walk me, it's okay.
- Work? Hang on, isn't this your job?

564
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:19,843
You can't take sleeping pills, man.
That's Dream Science 101.

565
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,729
Well, it doesn't say anything in the book
about not doing it.

566
00:41:21,797 --> 00:41:23,968
I mean, that's quite a major warning, right?
It should say so.

567
00:41:24,036 --> 00:41:26,403
That's where all the incoherence
and the melting faces

568
00:41:26,468 --> 00:41:30,975
and the dream monsters breed, man.
That's like inviting gremlins to a pool party.

569
00:41:32,037 --> 00:41:34,687
Hey, see if you can help me with this, huh?

570
00:41:35,364 --> 00:41:37,372
See, I don't know, Mel.
I've been reading this guy, Alan Weigert,

571
00:41:37,445 --> 00:41:38,721
and he says that
you should take long baths...

572
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:41,636
Alan Weigert?
I told you not to read that crap!

573
00:41:41,701 --> 00:41:45,214
Alan Weigert is a scummer and a sell-out.
I know him. You don't know him.

574
00:41:45,285 --> 00:41:48,252
- What do you mean, you know him?
- He's a sick man and a goddamn capitalist.

575
00:41:48,324 --> 00:41:51,423
- Wait, how do you...
- Do you know what a traitor is, man?

576
00:41:51,493 --> 00:41:55,584
- Who, me or him?
- Balls. I gotta go to work.

577
00:41:55,749 --> 00:41:57,854
Jesus Christ.

578
00:41:57,924 --> 00:41:59,102
Mel...

579
00:41:59,844 --> 00:42:03,837
Look, man, you gotta come to the group.
That's where we work these things out.

580
00:42:03,908 --> 00:42:07,257
I'm not good with groups.
I just need some tips, like...

581
00:42:07,332 --> 00:42:08,990
Does anybody else have these problems?

582
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:13,533
For most people, it's recreation.
You know, inner child shit, midlife crisis...

583
00:42:13,604 --> 00:42:16,703
- But that's for me, too, though, right?
- It's not sounding like it.

584
00:42:16,772 --> 00:42:19,455
Can't you just give me
something to help with the sleeping?

585
00:42:19,524 --> 00:42:21,946
- Do you eat healthy?
- Healthy? What, like granola bars?

586
00:42:22,021 --> 00:42:26,331
- Do you... Do you exercise? You like sports?
- Not really, no.

587
00:42:26,405 --> 00:42:32,384
- You jog? You look like a jogger.
- Do I? No, I don't jog, Mel.

588
00:42:32,452 --> 00:42:36,959
Well, start. Start running. Run till you drop.
You'll sleep like a baby.

589
00:42:37,092 --> 00:42:38,205
God, I never thought of that.

590
00:42:38,277 --> 00:42:40,000
Yeah, there's nothing better
than blowing it out,

591
00:42:40,068 --> 00:42:42,621
because nothing will make you more tired.

592
00:42:42,692 --> 00:42:45,725
Jeez, I can't believe I didn't think of that.
Mel, you're a genius.

593
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:48,284
If there's anything
I can ever do for you, then...

594
00:42:48,356 --> 00:42:51,073
- You got 50 bucks?
- Sure, yeah.

595
00:42:52,741 --> 00:42:55,490
Here, take my card. We'll treat it as a private.

596
00:42:55,557 --> 00:42:58,077
- Okay.
- If you have any problems, you call me.

597
00:42:59,012 --> 00:43:00,222
Thanks.

598
00:43:03,141 --> 00:43:05,312
- Do you have an invitation, sir?
- No!

599
00:45:07,268 --> 00:45:09,952
Gary, there's only so much
you can control, man.

600
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:12,028
You can't think that you can be in charge
of every element.

601
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,955
- Well, why not? Isn't that the whole point?
- You just can't.

602
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,922
No, isn't that the whole point?
Listen, do you have a more advanced book?

603
00:45:16,997 --> 00:45:19,386
Because I really feel
that I've graduated to a higher level.

604
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,882
- I'm better than the average dream reader.
- I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.

605
00:45:21,956 --> 00:45:23,450
- Are you encountering dream monsters?
- Yes, I am!

606
00:45:23,524 --> 00:45:26,873
And they're not fucking Muppets,
let me tell you. They're Italians.

607
00:45:26,949 --> 00:45:29,982
- You have any coherent conversations?
- All the time, Mel,

608
00:45:30,052 --> 00:45:32,670
but it's not sleeping pills. I'm totally clean.

609
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:35,588
By the way, bring the thermos in tomorrow,
will you, Tony?

610
00:45:35,652 --> 00:45:39,165
This sounds like
deep control aggression, man.

611
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,643
I mean, you having a lot of problems
in your life?

612
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:41,690
Yeah, all I have are problems,

613
00:45:41,764 --> 00:45:44,481
and now my real-life girlfriend
is showing up in my dreams.

614
00:45:44,548 --> 00:45:47,843
What about getting away for a few days?
You know, sometimes getting away

615
00:45:47,908 --> 00:45:50,625
from your waking-life problems,
it clears your dreams.

616
00:45:50,693 --> 00:45:51,936
I can't, not in any real way.

617
00:45:52,005 --> 00:45:54,907
- Meet me tomorrow at noon at the studio.
- Fine.

618
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,158
- We'll go somewhere.
- Okay, where?

619
00:45:56,228 --> 00:45:59,010
I'll take you on a field trip. Be there at noon.

620
00:46:00,197 --> 00:46:01,571
Field trip.

621
00:46:04,324 --> 00:46:08,863
See how relaxed you're getting?
Girlfriends, man...

622
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,973
Let me tell you something.

623
00:46:15,045 --> 00:46:18,874
I haven't had a real-life relationship
since 1966.

624
00:46:19,332 --> 00:46:22,780
You should enjoy this time.
Embrace your freedom.

625
00:46:22,852 --> 00:46:25,667
And more than anything, relax.

626
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:29,792
It's a pillow-top. This is good.
Try this bed. It's good.

627
00:46:33,764 --> 00:46:38,815
I used to really believe that everybody
was at the center of their own universe.

628
00:46:38,884 --> 00:46:42,813
You know, like we're all suns
being orbited by the people in our lives.

629
00:46:44,357 --> 00:46:47,488
But at a certain point,
if things don't go your way,

630
00:46:47,556 --> 00:46:54,234
maybe it's better just to pick someone
or something great and just orbit that.

631
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:00,607
- You know?
- I felt like that's what I was doing with Dora.

632
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:07,836
Sometimes I wish you could just
hit the sack and never wake up.

633
00:47:09,796 --> 00:47:15,131
If your favorite song never ended
or your best book never closed,

634
00:47:15,204 --> 00:47:19,711
if the emotions mustered from these things
would just go on and on,

635
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,081
who wouldn't want to stay asleep?

636
00:47:23,748 --> 00:47:29,531
Now, the guy who discovers
that perpetual dream,

637
00:47:29,604 --> 00:47:31,262
he's my man.

638
00:47:32,292 --> 00:47:34,780
He's going to make a billion dollars.

639
00:47:39,077 --> 00:47:42,338
I gotta tell you, Gary,
hanging out with you is pretty depressing.

640
00:47:42,468 --> 00:47:45,086
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Think I'm going to go take a nap.

641
00:47:45,156 --> 00:47:47,611
- No, come on. Let me get you some food.
- No, I got no appetite.

642
00:47:47,812 --> 00:47:49,307
- Please.
- No, I'm going to jog it off.

643
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,355
- Okay.
- Watch this.

644
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,434
I know it's crazy, but this is her.
I swear to God.

645
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,442
In, like, seven magazines.
I'm flipping out here!

646
00:49:20,548 --> 00:49:22,173
- I can see that.
- This is surreal. But this is Anna.

647
00:49:22,244 --> 00:49:23,357
What, you've given her a name?

648
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:25,119
I haven't given her anything.
That's her name.

649
00:49:25,188 --> 00:49:27,838
She is absolutely hot as shit,
it's got to be said.

650
00:49:27,908 --> 00:49:29,948
This doesn't just happen in life, Paul.
This means something.

651
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:33,020
This is like a motivating force of destiny.
This is fate!

652
00:49:33,092 --> 00:49:34,652
- So what's her real-life name?
- Well, that's the trouble.

653
00:49:34,724 --> 00:49:36,131
None of these magazines
have any credits or anything.

654
00:49:36,196 --> 00:49:38,563
I was hoping that
maybe you could help me track her down.

655
00:49:38,628 --> 00:49:40,122
Do you know what's happened?
You've seen this woman in,

656
00:49:40,196 --> 00:49:43,043
like, one of Dora's magazines,
or on a billboard or something like that.

657
00:49:43,108 --> 00:49:44,864
And that's how she's got
inside your head, right?

658
00:49:44,932 --> 00:49:46,077
I was reading one of those dream books,

659
00:49:46,148 --> 00:49:49,312
and it said that all of our dreams
have a basis in reality somewhere.

660
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,558
- Sorry, what book?
- So that's...

661
00:49:50,628 --> 00:49:52,188
When did you start reading a book?

662
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,748
Well, you didn't lend me yours, did you?
I had to go out and find my own.

663
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,511
I bought Alan Weigert, you know?

664
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,882
I just want to understand
what you're going through a bit better.

665
00:49:58,948 --> 00:50:01,337
- So how's that working out?
- Really, really good.

666
00:50:01,412 --> 00:50:03,070
- Actually, you remember the Keppel twins?
- Yeah.

667
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,409
- I fucked Sandy last night.
- Jenny was the good-looking one.

668
00:50:05,508 --> 00:50:06,882
She watched.

669
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:09,475
Listen, I've got this covered, all right?
I'm on it.

670
00:50:09,668 --> 00:50:10,616
Stop sleeping!

671
00:50:23,684 --> 00:50:24,993
<i>Get out of bed!</i>

672
00:50:25,252 --> 00:50:27,554
<i>I know you're sleeping, you fucked up mess.</i>

673
00:50:27,652 --> 00:50:28,830
<i>Hello?</i>

674
00:50:29,156 --> 00:50:30,650
<i>Come on. Hello?</i>

675
00:50:30,724 --> 00:50:33,985
<i>All right, look, just get out of bed, shower,</i>
<i>and meet me at 2:00 p.m., okay?</i>

676
00:50:34,051 --> 00:50:36,473
<i>And brush your teeth. Bye.</i>

677
00:50:38,084 --> 00:50:41,859
There are a lot of things in your life
that you owe me for, okay?

678
00:50:41,924 --> 00:50:43,485
But this one

679
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,169
will be the biggest one of all time.

680
00:50:49,508 --> 00:50:54,397
Her name is Melodia and I've hired her
as "The Greatest Refreshment on Earth."

681
00:51:31,876 --> 00:51:33,916
Hi, Melodia. Hello.

682
00:51:34,212 --> 00:51:37,343
I just wanted you to meet
a very good friend of mine

683
00:51:37,411 --> 00:51:40,379
who's a musician I work with.
This is Gary Sheller.

684
00:51:40,452 --> 00:51:42,142
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

685
00:51:42,244 --> 00:51:43,804
Nice to meet you.

686
00:51:44,196 --> 00:51:45,243
Just as good.

687
00:51:45,764 --> 00:51:48,098
Gary composes a lot of the music
for the commercials we do.

688
00:51:48,164 --> 00:51:49,986
And if this goes to a TV commercial,

689
00:51:50,052 --> 00:51:51,262
he'll be doing that, too.

690
00:51:51,332 --> 00:51:53,503
But it's actually his fault
that you're here today

691
00:51:53,572 --> 00:51:56,921
because he saw you and said,
"That is the face of refreshment."

692
00:51:56,996 --> 00:51:58,654
And I always listen to Gary.

693
00:51:59,108 --> 00:52:00,090
Sweet.

694
00:52:00,164 --> 00:52:03,295
- Thank you, Gary.
- You're welcome. You deserve it.

695
00:52:03,652 --> 00:52:04,732
Why?

696
00:52:06,115 --> 00:52:07,326
Because you're great.

697
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:11,129
Did you write the music for this?

698
00:52:11,971 --> 00:52:13,084
This what?

699
00:52:14,276 --> 00:52:15,323
This.

700
00:52:16,516 --> 00:52:17,531
Not really...

701
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:19,358
Write for the photo shoot?

702
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:21,119
- He wrote it.
- Yeah, I wrote it.

703
00:52:21,412 --> 00:52:22,656
Cool.

704
00:52:25,572 --> 00:52:27,644
Are you coming to the dinner tonight?

705
00:52:27,716 --> 00:52:29,309
- What dinner?
- He's coming.

706
00:52:29,603 --> 00:52:30,552
Cool.

707
00:52:30,692 --> 00:52:32,732
Maybe you can save me a seat.

708
00:52:32,804 --> 00:52:34,265
Will you do that?

709
00:52:35,971 --> 00:52:37,532
Yeah, I'll do that.

710
00:52:37,604 --> 00:52:38,945
- Cool.
- Okay.

711
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:40,634
- Well, listen...
- Okay.

712
00:52:40,708 --> 00:52:42,497
Thank you very much for your time,

713
00:52:42,564 --> 00:52:45,019
and you're doing some great stuff today.

714
00:52:47,172 --> 00:52:49,594
- See you later, Gary.
- Yeah.

715
00:52:58,244 --> 00:53:02,619
<i>Gary, meet Karl Heinz.</i>
<i>He's Melodia's ex-husband.</i>

716
00:53:02,788 --> 00:53:05,985
She hates me.
It was a marriage of dependence.

717
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:09,409
She needed a passport and I needed to be...

718
00:53:11,812 --> 00:53:14,179
Punished? As in scolded?

719
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:17,085
Yeah, like burned with a cigar.

720
00:53:20,932 --> 00:53:24,227
- I need him, don't I?
- Well, she'll be here, I swear.

721
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:26,461
- Hey.
- Hey, there she is!

722
00:53:26,532 --> 00:53:27,710
The lady of the moment.

723
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,209
- Hello.
- Welcome, welcome, welcome.

724
00:53:29,283 --> 00:53:32,000
- Move, Karl Heinz. Don't touch me!
- Hello, warrior princess.

725
00:53:32,068 --> 00:53:33,628
I thought maybe you'd left.

726
00:53:33,796 --> 00:53:35,803
Left? No.
I thought maybe you weren't turning up.

727
00:53:35,876 --> 00:53:38,178
That's my best friend, Naresta.

728
00:53:38,244 --> 00:53:39,454
- Hello. Hi, hi.
- Hi.

729
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,984
She killed a guy once in Brazil.

730
00:53:43,683 --> 00:53:46,847
Hi, can I have two shots of tequila
and a Kir Royale?

731
00:53:48,164 --> 00:53:49,211
So...

732
00:53:49,828 --> 00:53:52,381
- So, what are you into, Gary?
- What am I into?

733
00:53:53,476 --> 00:53:55,647
I don't know. What are you into?

734
00:53:56,003 --> 00:53:58,905
Just being alive, you know,
and staying young.

735
00:53:59,268 --> 00:54:02,781
Young here, minded, not in a looks way.
I don't care.

736
00:54:02,852 --> 00:54:06,496
I like my hips. I like my wrinkles.
I'm into life, you know?

737
00:54:06,819 --> 00:54:11,675
I feel like I just want to suck
every drop of juice out of it

738
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,984
and then fuck it to death and pass out.

739
00:54:16,132 --> 00:54:17,114
And you?

740
00:54:17,891 --> 00:54:21,055
Well, I haven't really done anything like that,

741
00:54:21,123 --> 00:54:23,228
you know, to death yet, but...

742
00:54:23,299 --> 00:54:25,950
- Yeah, I love a lot of stuff like that.
- Like what?

743
00:54:26,019 --> 00:54:27,874
Like the things that you were just saying.

744
00:54:30,115 --> 00:54:31,839
But what do you like?

745
00:54:33,572 --> 00:54:36,092
- I like dreams.
- Dreams?

746
00:54:36,164 --> 00:54:38,204
Dreams, like, you know, when you're asleep.

747
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:42,525
Cool. I never thought of that.

748
00:54:43,428 --> 00:54:45,402
What do you dream about?

749
00:54:45,764 --> 00:54:48,098
I dream about lots of things,

750
00:54:48,164 --> 00:54:51,676
but really I'm more concerned
with controlling my dreams, to be honest.

751
00:54:51,876 --> 00:54:53,665
Controlling them how?

752
00:54:56,868 --> 00:54:59,039
- How?
- By making them unravel...

753
00:55:00,644 --> 00:55:01,887
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

754
00:55:01,955 --> 00:55:03,581
By unraveling them

755
00:55:04,227 --> 00:55:06,169
in a way that I want, you know?

756
00:55:07,236 --> 00:55:09,472
Do you have a lot of sex dreams?

757
00:55:12,003 --> 00:55:13,378
I do, yeah.

758
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:15,131
Cool.

759
00:55:55,844 --> 00:55:58,048
God, she's so pretty.

760
00:55:58,116 --> 00:56:00,385
I've never had anyone that pretty
without having to pay for it.

761
00:56:00,451 --> 00:56:02,556
Did you tell her you wrote
<i>Checkpoint Carlos?</i>

762
00:56:02,627 --> 00:56:05,213
- I said we co-wrote it.
- No, we took co-credit, Paul.

763
00:56:05,284 --> 00:56:07,673
I can't even remember what I said, okay?
Anyway, you owe me big-time.

764
00:56:07,748 --> 00:56:09,242
Yes, I know.

765
00:56:09,316 --> 00:56:10,842
- She's pretty amazing.
- I know.

766
00:56:10,915 --> 00:56:12,803
Certainly giving me a little bit of ammo
for my dreams tonight.

767
00:56:12,868 --> 00:56:14,656
Don't say that. And don't do that.
Why would you...

768
00:56:14,724 --> 00:56:16,447
- You're not going to do that, are you?
- It's a dream.

769
00:56:16,804 --> 00:56:18,211
It's not like I'm going to fuck you, is it?

770
00:56:18,276 --> 00:56:21,145
Yeah, but it's not a dream, though, is it?
At least not in the sense that you mean.

771
00:56:21,219 --> 00:56:24,896
- Her look is sort of wrong, though.
- Her look?

772
00:56:25,092 --> 00:56:28,540
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. How are you?

773
00:56:28,611 --> 00:56:30,913
Good. I think she likes me a little bit.

774
00:56:31,171 --> 00:56:32,927
Why would you say that?

775
00:56:33,155 --> 00:56:34,530
I sense that.

776
00:56:35,108 --> 00:56:36,515
You're not going to do anything about it,
are you?

777
00:56:36,579 --> 00:56:39,329
No, no. I just mean she's, you know,
the kind of girl that likes everyone.

778
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,785
She's just really out there. She said
she wants to experience everything.

779
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,769
Well, that's why I like her.
She's the exact opposite of Dora.

780
00:56:43,844 --> 00:56:45,022
Oh, God.

781
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:46,968
Yes!

782
00:56:47,172 --> 00:56:48,765
Listen, I'm going to go
before I fuck your girlfriend.

783
00:56:48,836 --> 00:56:49,784
Why are you doing this to me, Paul?

784
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:51,802
You're right, you're right.
I'll wait till I'm asleep.

785
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:53,763
Listen, I will call you tomorrow
and I'll tell you what happened

786
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,234
- and we can compare notes.
- Don't do this, please.

787
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,820
- It'll be great. Melody, you're a star. Bye-bye.
<i>- Ciao,</i> Paul.

788
00:56:57,892 --> 00:56:59,583
- See you, Gary.
- Yeah.

789
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:04,543
- Do you want to get a drink?
- Sure.

790
00:57:04,804 --> 00:57:06,778
Who were those guys you were talking to?

791
00:57:06,947 --> 00:57:10,362
One's a stylist I used to work with
and the other I don't know.

792
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:14,297
- But they're gay.
- Right, they seemed kind of dickie.

793
00:57:14,852 --> 00:57:17,023
They're harmless. Let's go.

794
00:57:39,683 --> 00:57:41,112
Do you like this place?

795
00:57:41,188 --> 00:57:42,432
Yeah, it's not bad.

796
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:46,816
Do you ever wear your hair back?

797
00:57:47,556 --> 00:57:48,733
What's wrong with my hair?

798
00:57:48,803 --> 00:57:51,454
No, no, it's nothing.
I just think it might look good.

799
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:53,880
No.

800
00:57:55,748 --> 00:57:56,696
Not really.

801
00:57:57,923 --> 00:57:59,352
Yeah, that's nice.

802
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:01,250
Yes, Master.

803
00:58:01,923 --> 00:58:04,825
Anything else I can change about myself
to your liking?

804
00:58:06,467 --> 00:58:09,664
No, not today. You are perfect.

805
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:12,798
Even with all the zippers and...

806
00:58:14,884 --> 00:58:17,982
- You don't like my clothes?
- No, the clothes are great.

807
00:58:18,339 --> 00:58:20,641
I meant your jacket, which actually I...

808
00:58:21,475 --> 00:58:23,166
I like. It's very...

809
00:58:25,571 --> 00:58:27,033
Very backstage.

810
00:58:29,411 --> 00:58:31,680
Well, should we get into your style?

811
00:58:33,763 --> 00:58:34,876
I'm sorry.

812
00:58:35,075 --> 00:58:36,537
I like the jacket.

813
00:58:36,612 --> 00:58:40,223
- It's okay, you can say what you want.
- I'm not really crazy about the jacket.

814
00:58:40,291 --> 00:58:41,502
Jesus Christ!

815
00:58:41,572 --> 00:58:44,092
What? You just said I could say what I want.

816
00:58:44,515 --> 00:58:46,719
- Are you weird?
- What do you mean?

817
00:58:47,043 --> 00:58:48,287
Are you drunk?

818
00:58:48,355 --> 00:58:52,545
No, of course I'm not drunk. I just want
to have a nice time. Let's have some fun.

819
00:58:53,507 --> 00:58:56,507
Sorry, can I have two shots of tequila
and a white wine?

820
00:58:56,836 --> 00:58:59,203
- Yeah. You can't smoke that in here.
- Cool, okay.

821
00:58:59,267 --> 00:59:01,176
I can't have another one of those shots.

822
00:59:01,283 --> 00:59:02,712
I didn't order you one.

823
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,267
Please don't be mad. I was kidding.

824
00:59:06,628 --> 00:59:07,675
Half-kidding.

825
00:59:08,131 --> 00:59:09,309
I just want you to look great.

826
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,452
- I don't think that's wrong, that I want you...
- Stop talking.

827
00:59:11,524 --> 00:59:14,174
I don't mean it in a bad way, okay?
I mean it in a good way.

828
00:59:14,243 --> 00:59:16,251
Because I know how great you could look.

829
00:59:16,324 --> 00:59:19,007
I know how fantastic you would look
in a white tuxedo.

830
00:59:19,204 --> 00:59:20,186
What?

831
00:59:20,899 --> 00:59:22,426
- You're crazy.
- I'm not crazy.

832
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,474
Yeah, you're crazy. You're a loser.

833
00:59:27,011 --> 00:59:28,571
- Psychotic.
- Psychotic.

834
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,929
Hey! Hey!

835
00:59:36,003 --> 00:59:38,305
What are you doing?
You can't just walk out of the bar!

836
00:59:38,435 --> 00:59:39,580
Don't tell me what to do, please.

837
00:59:39,651 --> 00:59:41,375
Okay, well, would you mind telling me
what I've done?

838
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:42,785
Why are you being mean?

839
00:59:42,916 --> 00:59:44,410
Mean?

840
00:59:44,483 --> 00:59:46,239
Mean? I don't even know you, man.

841
00:59:46,596 --> 00:59:49,083
I mean, I just thought you were nice
and we could be friends

842
00:59:49,155 --> 00:59:50,137
and have a good time together.

843
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,895
I didn't really think you were
one of those douchebag guys.

844
00:59:52,995 --> 00:59:54,654
- But clearly you are.
- A douchebag?

845
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:57,374
Have you ever even said that word before?
What's "douchebag"?

846
00:59:57,443 --> 00:59:59,385
- I'm not a douchebag.
- I don't want to talk anymore, okay?

847
00:59:59,459 --> 01:00:00,637
I'm going home.

848
01:00:00,707 --> 01:00:02,365
You're making me feel
like I have to break up with you,

849
01:00:02,435 --> 01:00:04,126
and I don't even know you.

850
01:00:06,883 --> 01:00:08,312
Goodbye, Gary.

851
01:00:15,683 --> 01:00:16,632
Come on.

852
01:00:19,779 --> 01:00:20,990
Bullshit.

853
01:01:08,196 --> 01:01:09,952
You think that's me out there?

854
01:01:15,395 --> 01:01:18,145
You're a real piece of shit, Gary.
You know that?

855
01:01:20,163 --> 01:01:21,374
I've been sleeping.

856
01:01:23,716 --> 01:01:24,796
Oh, fuck!

857
01:01:27,171 --> 01:01:28,120
Jesus!

858
01:02:10,531 --> 01:02:12,571
Gary. How are you?

859
01:02:14,467 --> 01:02:16,256
I'm a wreck. How are you?

860
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:18,752
Oh, cool. I'm fine. I mean, come on in.

861
01:02:19,203 --> 01:02:20,413
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

862
01:02:21,123 --> 01:02:23,195
- Excuse the mess.
- Okay.

863
01:02:24,196 --> 01:02:25,657
Yeah, I was just...

864
01:02:25,731 --> 01:02:30,685
Funny little rabbit girl I dreamed up
was nipping at my toes and then

865
01:02:30,755 --> 01:02:32,479
you were at the door.

866
01:02:33,379 --> 01:02:34,328
Yeah.

867
01:02:35,555 --> 01:02:37,148
Did your girlfriend come back?

868
01:02:38,403 --> 01:02:41,305
No, she hasn't called or anything.

869
01:02:42,627 --> 01:02:44,482
- You don't look so good.
- No?

870
01:02:46,435 --> 01:02:49,468
I don't even know what to say, Mel.
Look, I'm falling apart, you know?

871
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:51,169
Is that soundproofing?

872
01:02:51,747 --> 01:02:54,114
Yeah. It's got cotton behind it.

873
01:02:56,324 --> 01:02:58,211
Swallowed up, right?

874
01:02:58,659 --> 01:03:02,008
You feel like everything real is

875
01:03:02,915 --> 01:03:04,377
in there

876
01:03:04,451 --> 01:03:08,030
and all this out here is just a waste of time.

877
01:03:10,563 --> 01:03:13,825
This is what you got to look forward to,
man, in your old age.

878
01:03:15,587 --> 01:03:17,627
I can't do anything anymore.

879
01:03:19,331 --> 01:03:21,567
I let you down. I let you down.

880
01:03:22,371 --> 01:03:24,989
The human default setting
is loneliness, man.

881
01:03:25,763 --> 01:03:27,770
Sadness is a guarantee.

882
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:31,106
People like you have
all these great distractions,

883
01:03:31,171 --> 01:03:33,375
girlfriends and jobs and shit.

884
01:03:33,475 --> 01:03:37,665
And all these distractions from unhappiness
equal life.

885
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:39,586
I don't have any of those things.

886
01:03:40,451 --> 01:03:42,818
In some ways, my cross to bear,

887
01:03:43,555 --> 01:03:46,173
in others, my freedom to cherish.

888
01:03:46,243 --> 01:03:49,211
You see all this stuff? This...

889
01:03:50,499 --> 01:03:54,176
My past and future lie in these stacks.

890
01:03:54,243 --> 01:03:56,348
I'm always looking for something new.

891
01:03:58,403 --> 01:04:01,153
I've saved eagles' nests
high in the Dolomites

892
01:04:01,219 --> 01:04:04,001
on Icarus' perfected wings.

893
01:04:08,163 --> 01:04:10,913
I bedded Cleopatra in a tub of figs.

894
01:04:15,075 --> 01:04:17,857
Not bad for a schlub from Astoria.

895
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:22,079
What should I do, Mel?

896
01:04:22,787 --> 01:04:24,314
I see it in you.

897
01:04:24,963 --> 01:04:26,556
It's like looking in a mirror.

898
01:04:28,899 --> 01:04:30,425
I know how lost you are.

899
01:04:34,819 --> 01:04:36,029
Hey, man...

900
01:04:36,803 --> 01:04:39,705
If you want out,
all you've got to do is say goodbye.

901
01:04:56,611 --> 01:04:59,906
- What the fuck did you do to this place?
- Fucking hell!

902
01:05:00,259 --> 01:05:02,081
- Jesus Christ! You can't do that to people.
- This is...

903
01:05:02,147 --> 01:05:04,121
I've been in here for 45 minutes
trying to find anything.

904
01:05:04,195 --> 01:05:07,162
I don't give a shit that I'm not 70.
You could have fucking killed me there!

905
01:05:07,235 --> 01:05:08,544
Oh, God!

906
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:11,130
- I didn't know you were coming back today.
- Yes, you did, Gary.

907
01:05:11,203 --> 01:05:13,624
- I didn't.
- Are you a complete lunatic?

908
01:05:13,699 --> 01:05:15,936
Okay, you have 100% lost it.

909
01:05:16,003 --> 01:05:18,174
Okay, listen. I had to do something
about the noise, right?

910
01:05:18,243 --> 01:05:20,632
I couldn't sleep. I... How are you?

911
01:05:20,707 --> 01:05:22,779
The noise is in your head.
Do you understand that?

912
01:05:22,851 --> 01:05:24,761
- No, it's not. The noise is in New York.
- This is really crazy!

913
01:05:24,835 --> 01:05:26,045
I can't believe you've covered

914
01:05:26,115 --> 01:05:27,708
- the entire bedroom with this stuff!
- I know, I know.

915
01:05:27,779 --> 01:05:29,601
I'm sorry. I'm going to bring it down.
I'll take it down.

916
01:05:29,667 --> 01:05:31,740
We're never getting
our security deposit back, by the way!

917
01:05:31,811 --> 01:05:33,534
- How was the trip?
- Unbelievable.

918
01:05:33,603 --> 01:05:37,531
The trip was great, thank you very much.
I signed a fantastic painter to the gallery.

919
01:05:37,603 --> 01:05:39,992
I'm going to curate my own show
with him and another painter.

920
01:05:40,067 --> 01:05:42,915
With him? He's a man. He's a man?

921
01:05:42,979 --> 01:05:44,091
A man painter?

922
01:05:44,163 --> 01:05:45,756
- What, a man painting with a hat on?
- What are you...

923
01:05:45,827 --> 01:05:48,282
- You developed a stutter since I saw you?
- No.

924
01:05:48,355 --> 01:05:51,290
I've been home for five minutes,
the questions are already boring.

925
01:05:51,363 --> 01:05:52,923
Where are you coming from, anyway,
at this hour?

926
01:05:52,995 --> 01:05:57,338
I'm coming from having breakfast outside,
because I'm not sleeping.

927
01:05:57,411 --> 01:05:59,200
Why are you so mad at me?

928
01:05:59,395 --> 01:06:01,085
You're right, okay?

929
01:06:01,251 --> 01:06:03,870
You're right. I'm sorry. I'm not mad. I just...

930
01:06:04,195 --> 01:06:05,820
This whole thing reeks of paralysis.

931
01:06:05,891 --> 01:06:08,673
I need to go and stay at Terry's
for a while, okay?

932
01:06:08,739 --> 01:06:10,626
This place is a disaster zone!

933
01:06:10,691 --> 01:06:12,928
Yeah, I know. I was going to call
the housekeeper. She can vacuum.

934
01:06:12,995 --> 01:06:15,133
Look, tell me about the trip.

935
01:06:15,203 --> 01:06:17,690
What do you want me to tell you, Gary?
It was great, okay?

936
01:06:17,763 --> 01:06:19,673
It was nice to feel like myself again.

937
01:06:19,747 --> 01:06:23,130
I liked not having to call.
I liked that the phone didn't ring.

938
01:06:24,131 --> 01:06:27,993
I'm going to go, all right? If you want
to have dinner or whatever this week...

939
01:06:29,475 --> 01:06:30,555
It's your boyfriend, Paul.

940
01:06:30,627 --> 01:06:32,154
<i>Give me the report. Gary?</i>

941
01:06:32,259 --> 01:06:33,753
Stop talking. Stop talking.

942
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:36,249
Dora. Dora, wait! Come on.

943
01:06:47,395 --> 01:06:50,362
- What are you doing here, Gary?
- Is your new boyfriend here?

944
01:06:50,627 --> 01:06:52,383
I'm going to smash his goddamn face in.

945
01:06:55,139 --> 01:06:57,278
What is this? What's going on here?

946
01:07:09,507 --> 01:07:11,133
Would you like to meet Vincent?

947
01:07:18,531 --> 01:07:19,992
You look great.

948
01:07:35,459 --> 01:07:36,506
Where are you going?

949
01:07:36,579 --> 01:07:40,572
Tell your boyfriend, wherever he is,
he's dead! I'm coming back!

950
01:07:50,435 --> 01:07:51,777
Hello?

951
01:07:53,763 --> 01:07:54,973
Dora?

952
01:08:33,219 --> 01:08:36,121
She is at Terry's. I know she's at Terry's.
I need to speak to her.

953
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:38,846
- She doesn't know what's been going on.
- Please don't drag me into this mess.

954
01:08:38,915 --> 01:08:40,573
- All right?
- I'm not dragging you into anything.

955
01:08:40,643 --> 01:08:43,228
- Have you called Terry?
- I called her once, okay?

956
01:08:43,298 --> 01:08:46,430
Just to check that she hadn't killed
herself, and she never called me back.

957
01:08:46,499 --> 01:08:49,401
So maybe she's dead, you know. But I don't
think so, 'cause she's filed for divorce.

958
01:08:49,475 --> 01:08:52,409
I know Dora's there, Paul.
Can we just go find her and see?

959
01:08:52,483 --> 01:08:55,800
- They'll let you in. It's still your apartment.
- I really hate you, you know?

960
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:57,664
You're only nice to me
when I do things for you.

961
01:08:57,731 --> 01:09:00,481
- I'm always nice to you.
- Well, be extra nice to me today, okay?

962
01:09:00,547 --> 01:09:02,456
I'm in a sensitive mood today.

963
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:06,331
In fact, let's swap places.
I'll be you, sensitive, depressed,

964
01:09:06,403 --> 01:09:08,312
and you can be me, okay?

965
01:09:08,387 --> 01:09:09,816
So what am I like?

966
01:09:11,042 --> 01:09:13,726
- Do you really want to know?
- Fuck you.

967
01:09:19,235 --> 01:09:20,729
Paul, I can't see any of Dora's stuff.

968
01:09:20,803 --> 01:09:23,869
- There's no toothbrushes or nothing.
- We should get out of here, you know,

969
01:09:23,939 --> 01:09:25,116
because this could really screw up
the settlement.

970
01:09:25,186 --> 01:09:26,747
- Did you check messages?
- No. I want to get out of here.

971
01:09:26,819 --> 01:09:28,379
- There's just too many memories, all right?
- Just do it.

972
01:09:28,451 --> 01:09:31,037
- What do I press here?
- All right, that.

973
01:09:31,107 --> 01:09:33,245
<i>Hey, Terry. This is Randy.</i>

974
01:09:33,699 --> 01:09:36,699
<i>I just wanted to tell you</i>
<i>what a good time I had last night.</i>

975
01:09:38,211 --> 01:09:40,829
Wind that back! Who the fuck is Randy?

976
01:09:40,898 --> 01:09:42,557
Please be quiet.
I can't hear the next message.

977
01:09:42,627 --> 01:09:44,317
Do you know any Randys?
I don't know any Randys!

978
01:09:44,386 --> 01:09:47,682
And you know what? If there is such
a thing as a Randy, he's the kind of man

979
01:09:47,747 --> 01:09:51,009
that digs and chops wood.
I'm going to be sick, Gary, I swear.

980
01:10:07,299 --> 01:10:09,241
I know you're here, Paul.

981
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:14,491
The doorman told me you just came in.

982
01:10:17,026 --> 01:10:18,968
Come out and I won't be mad.

983
01:10:21,251 --> 01:10:24,000
Did you or did you not
fuck a lumberjack by the name of Randy?

984
01:10:24,067 --> 01:10:25,954
That is none of your business.

985
01:10:26,307 --> 01:10:27,769
Is that a yes?

986
01:10:28,067 --> 01:10:30,488
- I'm not answering that.
- Oh, for fuck's...

987
01:10:30,562 --> 01:10:32,951
Well... All right, well...

988
01:10:33,315 --> 01:10:35,682
What, does he go to the gym all the time,
does he?

989
01:10:35,811 --> 01:10:36,858
What?

990
01:10:39,939 --> 01:10:41,368
From Randy?

991
01:10:43,747 --> 01:10:45,536
I'm going to rape you.

992
01:10:49,058 --> 01:10:51,131
- Hi, Terry.
- Hi, Gary.

993
01:10:52,355 --> 01:10:54,045
He is not going to rape you.

994
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:55,585
That's a relief.

995
01:10:56,931 --> 01:10:57,978
How are you, Gary?

996
01:10:58,466 --> 01:11:01,696
I'm okay, thanks.
I'm going to take him home.

997
01:11:03,075 --> 01:11:04,384
Is Dora staying here?

998
01:11:04,451 --> 01:11:06,393
I'm not saying anything to you clowns.

999
01:11:06,498 --> 01:11:08,157
Well, if you could just tell her
that we stopped by.

1000
01:11:08,227 --> 01:11:11,642
- Come on.
- I'm not going! She's breaking my heart.

1001
01:11:33,443 --> 01:11:34,490
Hey!

1002
01:11:37,058 --> 01:11:38,203
Paul!

1003
01:11:40,387 --> 01:11:43,169
Hey, I can't believe you're so upset.
I thought you'd be glad to be rid of her.

1004
01:11:43,234 --> 01:11:44,445
I am.

1005
01:11:45,891 --> 01:11:46,938
I am.

1006
01:11:48,611 --> 01:11:50,399
You know, in some ways...

1007
01:11:50,883 --> 01:11:52,574
It's just... I don't know.

1008
01:11:54,242 --> 01:11:58,072
I want her to sit in that apartment
for the rest of her life,

1009
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:00,121
you know, just thinking about me.

1010
01:12:01,635 --> 01:12:05,082
I want her to think about how, you know,
I'm the best.

1011
01:12:07,395 --> 01:12:12,446
And to be hoping that I might come back.
And I might! I might come back.

1012
01:12:12,515 --> 01:12:14,555
If there's nothing better out there.

1013
01:12:15,491 --> 01:12:19,647
I know, it sounds crazy,
but this is too much for me.

1014
01:12:23,011 --> 01:12:25,116
I don't want her to be happy.

1015
01:12:27,619 --> 01:12:29,277
Does that make me selfish?

1016
01:12:30,755 --> 01:12:31,867
Yes.

1017
01:12:33,219 --> 01:12:35,259
Yeah, I think it does, Paul.

1018
01:12:35,362 --> 01:12:38,013
I thought this was everything you wanted.

1019
01:12:38,627 --> 01:12:40,481
It is. It is.

1020
01:12:43,779 --> 01:12:45,567
Can I please call her?

1021
01:14:12,003 --> 01:14:13,596
Don't say goodbye.

1022
01:15:45,762 --> 01:15:47,191
Are you happy?

1023
01:15:47,938 --> 01:15:50,688
This actually makes me so sad.

1024
01:15:52,578 --> 01:15:54,204
You are talented.

1025
01:15:54,275 --> 01:15:56,217
I always knew it,

1026
01:15:56,291 --> 01:15:58,014
but I love seeing it.

1027
01:17:52,226 --> 01:17:54,648
- Hey, Lily.
- Hey. Have you been away?

1028
01:17:54,722 --> 01:17:56,610
No, no, no. I've been in.

1029
01:18:58,402 --> 01:18:59,809
What's up, Gary?

1030
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:01,784
Hi.

1031
01:19:29,762 --> 01:19:31,551
Dora! Dora!

1032
01:19:32,099 --> 01:19:33,146
Dora!

1033
01:19:35,458 --> 01:19:37,280
Gary?

1034
01:19:37,346 --> 01:19:39,037
What the hell are you doing here?

1035
01:19:39,106 --> 01:19:41,888
I came to see you.
I wanted to see what your show was like.

1036
01:19:42,562 --> 01:19:45,464
- Who just shows up? You're nuts!
- No, I'm great!

1037
01:19:45,539 --> 01:19:46,968
Dora, I'm really good now.

1038
01:19:49,027 --> 01:19:50,139
Where are you going?

1039
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:52,414
We've got this big dinner for the opening.

1040
01:19:52,674 --> 01:19:55,227
- Can I go?
- I mean, yeah, I guess.

1041
01:19:55,714 --> 01:19:58,267
This is so weird!
I can't believe you just showed up.

1042
01:19:58,338 --> 01:20:02,331
No, it's cool!
It's cool that we do these things together.

1043
01:20:05,314 --> 01:20:08,281
- Who are you?
- I'll be there in two seconds.

1044
01:20:09,954 --> 01:20:13,369
Gary, you can't just show up
and save everything.

1045
01:20:13,442 --> 01:20:14,751
Isn't that the point?

1046
01:20:14,818 --> 01:20:17,022
You know, why not? Who is that?

1047
01:20:19,202 --> 01:20:21,209
What do you want me to say?

1048
01:20:21,890 --> 01:20:25,239
Did you hear the music
that was playing inside just now?

1049
01:20:25,602 --> 01:20:26,813
Yeah, I guess.

1050
01:20:29,026 --> 01:20:30,717
What, you didn't like it?

1051
01:20:30,946 --> 01:20:33,696
I don't know, I mean,
I wasn't really listening.

1052
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:36,897
I wanted you to hear it.

1053
01:20:37,858 --> 01:20:39,767
I kind of wrote it for you.

1054
01:20:41,154 --> 01:20:42,267
You did?

1055
01:20:43,586 --> 01:20:44,764
Yeah.

1056
01:20:45,570 --> 01:20:47,904
Could you just... Wait one minute, please.

1057
01:20:48,578 --> 01:20:50,269
- Just wait.
- Gary!

1058
01:20:58,914 --> 01:21:00,986
<i>This is the future. This is now.</i>

1059
01:21:01,635 --> 01:21:02,976
<i>This will change your life.</i>

1060
01:21:05,442 --> 01:21:06,424
It's a great read.

1061
01:21:09,346 --> 01:21:10,295
It's got a good feeling to it.

1062
01:21:10,402 --> 01:21:12,125
I owe it all to Gary.

1063
01:21:14,306 --> 01:21:18,235
No, I think the book is really interesting.
It's a great entertainment.

1064
01:21:18,722 --> 01:21:21,242
It's not what Gary was about.
I mean, he was...

1065
01:21:21,634 --> 01:21:24,449
He was always so alive and inspired

1066
01:21:25,826 --> 01:21:28,860
and wanted to succeed.
I mean, it was amazing.

1067
01:21:31,490 --> 01:21:34,141
Have you spoken to Dora about the book?

1068
01:21:36,066 --> 01:21:38,171
I've come to think that you should...

1069
01:21:39,202 --> 01:21:40,380
You have to...

1070
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:44,065
Not wanting to sound like <i>South Pacific,</i>
"You've got to have a dream."

1071
01:21:44,130 --> 01:21:45,886
You do have to have a dream.

1072
01:21:45,954 --> 01:21:49,467
But heaven help the person
who actually achieves that.

1073
01:21:50,594 --> 01:21:53,180
<i>It's like the end of the rainbow,</i>
<i>you know, the little pot of gold.</i>

1074
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:54,973
<i>You know it's not there,</i>

1075
01:21:55,042 --> 01:21:56,121
<i>but it's nice to believe in it</i>

1076
01:21:56,194 --> 01:21:59,064
<i>because it actually gives you</i>
<i>a direction to travel in.</i>

1077
01:22:01,794 --> 01:22:05,951
It's nice to get a little sun.
Warmth makes the itches go away.

1078
01:22:07,394 --> 01:22:09,663
Gary, the antibiotics...

1079
01:22:09,954 --> 01:22:11,710
I've got to live a little.

1080
01:22:12,514 --> 01:22:13,496
Okay.

1081
01:22:13,570 --> 01:22:15,872
Hey, I brought this great big long
extension cable so that we can...

1082
01:22:15,938 --> 01:22:17,913
This afternoon, we can pull the TV out,
we can put it right there,

1083
01:22:17,986 --> 01:22:19,393
and we can watch
the Dylan documentary again.

1084
01:22:19,458 --> 01:22:20,440
Good man.

1085
01:22:20,514 --> 01:22:21,790
You're going to be on your feet
really soon, buddy.

1086
01:22:21,858 --> 01:22:24,160
I hope not. I like being waited on.

1087
01:22:25,122 --> 01:22:27,805
- Do you want me to get your sunglasses?
- No, I'm great, hon.

1088
01:22:27,874 --> 01:22:29,663
I should break my leg.

1089
01:22:31,618 --> 01:22:33,113
Now, listen.

1090
01:22:33,186 --> 01:22:36,602
I heard yesterday we're going to
definitely start mixing the album on Friday.

1091
01:22:36,674 --> 01:22:38,430
- Oh, great.
- So try and come along if you can.

1092
01:22:38,498 --> 01:22:40,832
- I will. I'll hobble over.
- Hobble over.

1093
01:22:40,994 --> 01:22:42,204
Speaking of which...

1094
01:22:50,146 --> 01:22:52,568
- Where are you going?
- I should stretch it out and walk on it.

1095
01:22:52,642 --> 01:22:54,136
It's part of the regimen.

1096
01:22:55,426 --> 01:22:58,328
- You want me to go with you?
- No, no. It's good for me to do it alone.

1097
01:22:58,498 --> 01:23:01,215
If he's a boy, he'll be Gary.
What do you think?

1098
01:23:01,986 --> 01:23:03,393
Take it easy.

1099
01:23:04,066 --> 01:23:05,211
I will.

1100
01:23:47,009 --> 01:23:48,024
I love you.

1101
01:24:11,234 --> 01:24:13,007
I love you,
too.

1102
