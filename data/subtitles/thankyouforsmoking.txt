1
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,111
Robin Williger.

2
00:02:42,217 --> 00:02:45,812
He is a 15-year-old freshman
from Racine, Wisconsin.

3
00:02:45,921 --> 00:02:47,616
He enjoys studying history.

4
00:02:47,722 --> 00:02:49,350
He's on the debate team.

5
00:02:49,457 --> 00:02:52,723
Robin's future looked
very, very bright,

6
00:02:52,828 --> 00:02:54,658
but recently he was
diagnosed with cancer,

7
00:02:54,763 --> 00:02:56,319
a very tough kind of cancer.

8
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,331
and he no longer thinks
that cigarettes are cool.

9
00:03:07,473 --> 00:03:09,771
Whoo!

10
00:03:09,876 --> 00:03:13,140
And our final guest today
is Nick Naylor.

11
00:03:13,245 --> 00:03:17,806
Mr. Naylor is the vice president
of the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

12
00:03:17,915 --> 00:03:20,941
Now, they are the tobacco
industry's main lobby

13
00:03:21,051 --> 00:03:22,348
in Washington, D.C.

14
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,512
And Mr. Naylor is
their chief spokesman.

15
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:45,301
<i>Few people on this planet know</i>

16
00:03:45,406 --> 00:03:47,532
<i>what it is to be truly despised.</i>

17
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:49,870
<i>Can you blame them?</i>

18
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:52,343
<i>I earn a living
fronting an organization</i>

19
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:55,710
<i>that kills 1,200 human beings a day.</i>

20
00:03:55,816 --> 00:03:57,009
<i>1,200 people.</i>

21
00:03:57,114 --> 00:03:59,606
<i>We're talking
two jumbo jet plane loads</i>

22
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:02,415
<i>of men, women and children.</i>

23
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:03,546
<i>I mean, there's Attila,</i>

24
00:04:03,656 --> 00:04:05,180
<i>Genghis,</i>

25
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,188
<i>and me,</i>

26
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:07,552
<i>Nick Naylor,</i>

27
00:04:07,658 --> 00:04:08,682
<i>the face of cigarettes...</i>

28
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:11,555
<i>the Colonel Sanders of nicotine.</i>

29
00:04:11,662 --> 00:04:13,128
<i>This is where I work,</i>

30
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:15,755
<i>the Academy of Tobacco Studies.</i>

31
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:18,025
<i>It was established
by seven gentlemen</i>

32
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,725
<i>You may recognize from C-SPAN.</i>

33
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:22,464
<i>These guys realized quick
if they were going to claim</i>

34
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:23,663
<i>that cigarettes were not addictive,</i>

35
00:04:23,773 --> 00:04:25,934
<i>they better have proof.</i>

36
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:27,871
<i>This is the man they rely on,</i>

37
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,102
<i>Erhardt Von Grupten Mundt.</i>

38
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:32,476
<i>They found him in Germany.</i>

39
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,105
<i>I won't go into the details.</i>

40
00:04:34,215 --> 00:04:35,375
<i>He's been testing the link</i>

41
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,710
<i>between nicotine
and lung cancer</i>

42
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:40,081
<i>for 30 years and hasn't found
any conclusive results.</i>

43
00:04:40,187 --> 00:04:41,084
<i>The man's a genius.</i>

44
00:04:41,188 --> 00:04:42,849
<i>He could disprove gravity.</i>

45
00:04:42,956 --> 00:04:44,616
<i>Then we've got our sharks.</i>

46
00:04:44,724 --> 00:04:46,487
<i>We draft them out
of Ivy League law schools</i>

47
00:04:46,592 --> 00:04:48,889
<i>and give them time-shares
and sports cars.</i>

48
00:04:48,993 --> 00:04:50,552
<i>It's just like
a John Grisham novel-</i>

49
00:04:50,663 --> 00:04:53,222
<i>You know, without all the espionage.</i>

50
00:04:53,332 --> 00:04:56,562
<i>Most importantly,
we've got spin control.</i>

51
00:04:56,669 --> 00:04:58,499
<i>That's where I come in.</i>

52
00:04:58,603 --> 00:04:59,968
<i>I get paid to talk.</i>

53
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:01,627
<i>I don't have an MD or law degree.</i>

54
00:05:04,073 --> 00:05:07,236
<i>I have a bachelor's in
kicking ass and taking names.</i>

55
00:05:07,344 --> 00:05:09,776
<i>You know that guy
who can pick up any girl?</i>

56
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,936
<i>I'm him</i>

57
00:05:11,047 --> 00:05:12,139
<i>on crack.</i>

58
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,442
This is obviously a heated issue

59
00:05:17,553 --> 00:05:20,247
and we do have a lot
that we want to cover today.

60
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:22,451
Nick, do you have a question?

61
00:05:22,557 --> 00:05:23,648
Joan,

62
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:27,557
how on earth would
Big Tobacco profit

63
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,094
off of the loss of this young man?

64
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,390
Now, I hate to think
in such callous terms,

65
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,592
but, if anything,
we'd be losing a customer.

66
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,794
It's not only our hope,
it's in our best interest

67
00:05:38,904 --> 00:05:41,133
to keep Robin alive and smoking.

68
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,901
- That's ludicrous.
- Let me tell you something,

69
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:44,839
Joan, and please,
let me share something

70
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:48,571
with the fine, concerned
people in the audience today.

71
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:52,239
The Ron Goodes of this world...

72
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:54,908
want the Robin Willigers to die.

73
00:05:55,018 --> 00:05:56,110
- What?
- You know why?

74
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,810
So that their budgets will go up.

75
00:05:57,921 --> 00:06:00,787
This is nothing less than
trafficking in human misery,

76
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:02,652
and you, sir, ought
to be ashamed of yourself.

77
00:06:02,758 --> 00:06:04,247
I ought to be ashamed of myself?

78
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,488
As a matter of fact,
we're about to launch...

79
00:06:07,596 --> 00:06:10,587
a $50 million campaign

80
00:06:10,697 --> 00:06:14,862
aimed at persuading kids
not to smoke.

81
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:17,130
Because I think
that we can all agree

82
00:06:17,237 --> 00:06:19,363
that there is nothing
more important

83
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:20,803
than America's children.

84
00:06:20,907 --> 00:06:22,271
All right, now,
that's something that

85
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,138
we're going to want
to know more about.

86
00:06:24,243 --> 00:06:25,403
But I have to take a short break.

87
00:06:25,512 --> 00:06:27,605
Hang on, a lot more coming.

88
00:06:30,582 --> 00:06:33,517
$50 million?! Are you
out of your fucking mind?!

89
00:06:33,618 --> 00:06:34,516
<i>Everyone has a boss.</i>

90
00:06:34,619 --> 00:06:35,517
<i>BR just happens</i>

91
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,143
<i>to be mine.</i>

92
00:06:37,255 --> 00:06:39,119
<i>He came from the vending
machine world.</i>

93
00:06:39,223 --> 00:06:40,884
<i>This made him tough.</i>

94
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:45,455
<i>The name BR came
from his tour in Vietnam.</i>

95
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:48,655
<i>The people who know
its meaning are all dead.</i>

96
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:50,197
The deal was five million!

97
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:53,063
$5 million will get you
a couple of subway posters.

98
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:54,100
It's not going to impress anyone.

99
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:55,362
That's the idea, Nick.

100
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,402
You'll be thanking me soon.

101
00:06:56,505 --> 00:06:57,665
This'll probably get you great press.

102
00:06:57,773 --> 00:07:00,138
I gotta call the captain
and see if this is gonna fly.

103
00:07:00,242 --> 00:07:02,335
Get your ass back to D.C.

104
00:07:16,156 --> 00:07:18,124
Thank you so much for coming.

105
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:20,856
Mr. Naylor?

106
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:21,948
It's your turn.

107
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,392
Ah.

108
00:07:24,496 --> 00:07:26,554
Joey is such a bright young man.

109
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:27,632
We all look forward

110
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:29,495
to his coming out
of his shell a little.

111
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:30,827
He's a bit shy.

112
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:32,730
Yeah, he gets that from his mother.

113
00:07:41,876 --> 00:07:44,641
<i>Hey, Joey.</i>

114
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:47,113
Please don't ruin my childhood.

115
00:07:47,215 --> 00:07:49,275
Come on, Joey. Trust me.

116
00:07:57,191 --> 00:08:00,251
How many of you want to be
lawyers when you grow up?

117
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:01,348
Right.

118
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:02,951
How about...

119
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:04,790
movie stars?

120
00:08:06,232 --> 00:08:07,357
How about lobbyists?

121
00:08:07,466 --> 00:08:08,398
What's that?

122
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,435
It's kind of like being a movie star.

123
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:12,297
It's what I do.
I talk for a living.

124
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:13,563
What do you talk about?

125
00:08:13,672 --> 00:08:15,731
I speak on behalf of cigarettes.

126
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,068
My mom used to smoke.

127
00:08:17,174 --> 00:08:19,802
She says that cigarettes kill.

128
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:22,310
Really? Now, is your mommy a doctor?

129
00:08:22,412 --> 00:08:23,309
No.

130
00:08:23,412 --> 00:08:25,142
A scientific researcher of some kind?

131
00:08:25,247 --> 00:08:26,475
No.

132
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:27,515
Well, she doesn't exactly sound

133
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:29,015
like a credible expert,
now, does she?

134
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:31,449
Don't feel bad.

135
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,453
It's okay to listen to your mom.

136
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,921
I mean, it's good to listen
to your parents... Joey.

137
00:08:36,024 --> 00:08:38,322
All I'm suggesting

138
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:40,827
is that there will always
be people trying to tell you

139
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:43,088
what to do and what to think.

140
00:08:43,196 --> 00:08:44,561
There probably already are
people doing that.

141
00:08:44,665 --> 00:08:45,563
Am I right?

142
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,598
Yes.

143
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:48,464
I'm here to say

144
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:52,003
that when someone tries to act
like some sort of an expert,

145
00:08:52,104 --> 00:08:55,596
you can respond, "Who says?"

146
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,403
<i>So, cigarettes are good for you?</i>

147
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:59,409
- No!
- No, that's not...

148
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:00,672
That's not what I'm getting at.

149
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,110
My point is that you have
to think for yourself.

150
00:09:03,214 --> 00:09:04,942
You have to challenge authority.

151
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:07,313
If your parents told you
that chocolate was dangerous,

152
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,943
would you just take their word for it?

153
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:10,145
No.

154
00:09:10,255 --> 00:09:11,245
Exactly.

155
00:09:11,355 --> 00:09:13,185
So perhaps instead of acting
like sheep

156
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,255
when it comes to cigarettes,

157
00:09:14,357 --> 00:09:15,790
you should find out for yourself.

158
00:09:15,892 --> 00:09:17,018
Okay, then.

159
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,492
Thank you, Mr. Naylor,
for joining us.

Any ideas?

178
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:07,198
I don't know.

00:10:09,738 --> 00:10:12,002
I'm lucky my product only makes
them bald before it kills them.

181
00:10:12,107 --> 00:10:14,006
You could hug the kids.

182
00:10:14,108 --> 00:10:16,077
They're not going
to let me hug the kids.

183
00:10:16,177 --> 00:10:17,735
Who's doing the segment,
Donaldson or Sawyer?

184
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:18,744
Sawyer, probably.

185
00:10:18,848 --> 00:10:19,745
You're fucked.

186
00:10:19,849 --> 00:10:20,747
Why?

187
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:21,975
Cause she's gonna hug them.

188
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,277
Look, if you see her going in
for a hug,

189
00:10:24,385 --> 00:10:27,217
maybe just box her out,
get in there before she does.

190
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:28,913
<i>Bobby Jay works for SAFETY,</i>

191
00:10:29,022 --> 00:10:31,251
<i>the Society for the Advancement of Firearms</i>

192
00:10:31,357 --> 00:10:33,153
<i>and Effective Training for Youth.</i>

193
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,556
You want me to smile?

194
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,729
<i>After watching the footage
of the Kent State shootings,</i>

195
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:42,664
<i>Bobby Jay, then 17, signed up
for the National Guard</i>

196
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,860
<i>so he, too, could shoot
college students.</i>

197
00:10:44,969 --> 00:10:47,437
<i>But the National Guard
recruiter was out to lunch,</i>

198
00:10:47,538 --> 00:10:50,702
<i>so Bobby Jay ended up
shooting Panamanians instead,</i>

199
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:52,469
<i>which was almost as good
as college students.</i>

200
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,508
<i>Only they shoot back.</i>

201
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:57,272
You know, you can beat
a Breathalyzer

202
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,372
- by sucking on activated charcoal tablets?
- Really?

203
00:11:00,482 --> 00:11:02,041
Maybe we should change
our campaign to

204
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:04,117
"If You Must Drink and Drive,
Suck Charcoal."

205
00:11:04,218 --> 00:11:05,276
Yeah, but don't the police wonder

206
00:11:05,386 --> 00:11:06,284
why you're sucking on charcoal?

207
00:11:06,387 --> 00:11:08,185
There's no law against charcoal.

208
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:09,780
- Yet.
- Yet.

209
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:17,653
Dad, why is the American
government the best government?

210
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:19,288
Because of our
endless appeals system.

211
00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:24,925
Joe, you're not writing down
what I just said are you?

212
00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:26,196
Mm-hmm.

213
00:11:26,304 --> 00:11:28,295
Joey, stop for a second.

214
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:29,897
What is the subject of your essay?

215
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:32,806
Why is American government
the best government in the world.

216
00:11:32,912 --> 00:11:34,537
Your teacher crafted that question?

217
00:11:34,646 --> 00:11:36,409
Yeah. Why?

218
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:39,311
Well... I'll look past
the obvious problems

219
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,714
in syntax for a moment,

220
00:11:40,818 --> 00:11:42,911
and I'll focus more on the core
of the question.

221
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,213
I mean, "A,"

222
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:46,948
does America have
the best government in the world?

223
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:48,716
And "B," what constitutes
a "best government"?

224
00:11:48,823 --> 00:11:51,257
Is it crime, is it poverty, literacy?

225
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:52,793
Hmm?

226
00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:53,827
And America - definitely not best.

227
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,123
Perhaps not even better than most.

228
00:11:55,229 --> 00:11:56,595
We do have a very
entertaining government...

229
00:11:56,698 --> 00:11:57,995
Dad.

230
00:11:58,099 --> 00:11:59,929
I'm sorry.

231
00:12:01,236 --> 00:12:03,669
Are you familiar with the term "B.S."?

232
00:12:03,772 --> 00:12:05,328
Bullshit.

233
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:06,701
Yes, exactly.

234
00:12:06,807 --> 00:12:09,708
B.S., if I may, is what
questions like the one

235
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,710
your teacher posed are made for.

236
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:13,746
Because even if America
had the best government,

237
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:15,369
there'd be no way to prove it.

238
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,811
And how many pages are you writing?

239
00:12:16,915 --> 00:12:17,813
Two pages.

240
00:12:17,915 --> 00:12:19,507
Two pages...

241
00:12:19,618 --> 00:12:21,176
Definitely not in two pages.

242
00:12:21,285 --> 00:12:23,447
So what am I supposed to write?

243
00:12:23,555 --> 00:12:25,249
You can write whatever you want.

244
00:12:25,355 --> 00:12:26,755
Okay.

245
00:12:26,858 --> 00:12:27,846
Write about...

246
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,359
write about America's
amazing ability

247
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:33,453
to make profit by breaking down
trading tariffs

248
00:12:33,563 --> 00:12:35,928
and bringing American jobs
to Third World countries.

249
00:12:36,032 --> 00:12:37,965
Or how good we are
at executing felons.

250
00:12:38,068 --> 00:12:39,694
They're all correct answers.

251
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:41,770
I can do that?

252
00:12:41,871 --> 00:12:43,394
See, Joey, that's the beauty
of argument.

253
00:12:43,505 --> 00:12:45,903
'Cause if you argue correctly,
you're never wrong.

254
00:12:53,615 --> 00:12:56,515
Dad, if I finish
this essay within an hour,

255
00:12:56,617 --> 00:12:58,380
can we stay up all night?

256
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:03,148
That's a negotiation,
not an argument.

257
00:13:03,255 --> 00:13:05,984
<i>Well, Conway, see you made it.</i>

258
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:08,117
Yeah, I guess that little
voice was wrong.

259
00:13:08,226 --> 00:13:09,317
I feel better.

260
00:13:09,427 --> 00:13:10,587
I feel a lot better, too.

261
00:13:10,695 --> 00:13:13,255
As a matter of fact, I never
felt so good in my life.

262
00:13:13,364 --> 00:13:14,956
How about a cigarette?

263
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:32,905
Is he...?

264
00:13:33,015 --> 00:13:34,107
Yeah.

265
00:13:36,218 --> 00:13:39,653
Hey.

266
00:13:39,754 --> 00:13:43,190
Nick, you still own a watch, don't you?

267
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,485
Jill, I can't help feeling

268
00:13:44,592 --> 00:13:46,115
Joey's getting the wrong idea
about his dad.

269
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:47,751
It would be great if I could spend

270
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,385
a little more time with him,
you know?

271
00:13:49,497 --> 00:13:52,989
To give him a fair
and balanced perspective.

272
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:54,964
Nick, you had plenty
of time for that.

273
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,533
Now you're his weekend guardian.

274
00:13:56,634 --> 00:13:58,659
Besides, he has Brad.

275
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,863
He still needs his father.

276
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,166
Nick.

277
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:03,365
You have a second?

278
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:06,406
Sure, Brad.

279
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:10,276
Nick, your job
and everything aside,

280
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:12,314
I hope you understand
that secondhand smoke's

281
00:14:12,415 --> 00:14:14,112
a real killer.

282
00:14:14,217 --> 00:14:16,082
What are you talking about?

283
00:14:16,186 --> 00:14:17,813
I just hope you're providing

284
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,480
a smoke-free environment
for Joey, that's all I'm saying.

285
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:22,783
Brad, I'm his father.

286
00:14:22,891 --> 00:14:25,224
You're the guy fucking his mom.

287
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:29,927
That was unnecessary.

288
00:14:30,098 --> 00:14:33,533
Thank you all.
Thank you all for coming.

289
00:14:33,635 --> 00:14:36,103
Tobacco is winning the war.

290
00:14:36,204 --> 00:14:39,399
The war against our children.

291
00:14:39,506 --> 00:14:42,805
They like to use cartoons
and symbols to hook our kids.

292
00:14:42,909 --> 00:14:45,776
Well, now we have
a symbol of our own.

293
00:14:45,878 --> 00:14:48,071
Doctor.

294
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,943
It is my hope that
within the year

295
00:14:51,048 --> 00:14:52,743
every cigarette package

296
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,876
sold in America
will carry this symbol.

297
00:14:55,987 --> 00:14:58,216
Perhaps then, cigarettes
will finally be labeled

298
00:14:58,322 --> 00:15:01,415
appropriately as poison.

299
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,389
I will be holding
a congressional hearing

300
00:15:03,494 --> 00:15:06,224
to discuss the inclusion
of the skull and crossbones

301
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:07,795
in the next two weeks.

302
00:15:07,896 --> 00:15:09,296
As usual, I extend
an open invitation

303
00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:11,888
to big tobacco.

304
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,993
Perhaps this time they will
grace us with their presence.

305
00:15:16,105 --> 00:15:17,400
And their answers.

306
00:15:17,505 --> 00:15:18,903
Thank you very much.

307
00:15:23,611 --> 00:15:27,046
People, what is going on out there?

308
00:15:27,147 --> 00:15:30,775
I look down this table,
all I see are white flags.

309
00:15:30,884 --> 00:15:33,511
Our numbers are down
all across the board.

310
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,483
Teen smoking-
our bread and butter,

311
00:15:35,588 --> 00:15:37,317
is falling like a shit from heaven.

312
00:15:39,457 --> 00:15:41,118
We don't sell Tic Tacs,
for Christ's sake.

313
00:15:41,226 --> 00:15:42,886
We sell cigarettes.

314
00:15:42,994 --> 00:15:46,930
And they're cool and available
and addictive.

315
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:48,657
The job is almost done for us.

316
00:15:50,434 --> 00:15:55,337
This environmentalist
is challenging us.

317
00:15:55,438 --> 00:15:57,997
We have to have an answer.

318
00:15:58,107 --> 00:15:59,801
I'm asking you,

319
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:01,739
when this cocksucker puts
Captain Hook on our products,

320
00:16:01,843 --> 00:16:03,366
what the fuck are we going to do?

321
00:16:03,478 --> 00:16:06,039
- BR.
- Yeah, Nick.

322
00:16:06,147 --> 00:16:07,342
If I may.

323
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:09,882
In 1910,

324
00:16:09,984 --> 00:16:12,475
the U.S. Was producing
ten billion cigarettes a year.

325
00:16:12,586 --> 00:16:13,712
By 1930,

326
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,788
we were up to 123 billion.

327
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:17,858
What happened in between?

328
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:19,617
Three things.

329
00:16:19,726 --> 00:16:20,693
A world war,

330
00:16:20,794 --> 00:16:24,662
dieting... and movies.

331
00:16:24,764 --> 00:16:25,991
Movies?

332
00:16:26,097 --> 00:16:29,123
1927- talking pictures are born.

333
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:31,463
Suddenly, directors need to give
their actors

334
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:33,503
something to do
while they're talking.

335
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:36,300
Cary Grant, Carole Lombard
are lighting up.

336
00:16:36,407 --> 00:16:37,874
Bette Davis- a chimney.

337
00:16:37,975 --> 00:16:39,271
And Bogart-
remember the first picture

338
00:16:39,376 --> 00:16:40,434
with him and Lauren Bacall?

339
00:16:40,544 --> 00:16:43,012
Well, yea... not specifically.

340
00:16:43,112 --> 00:16:44,376
Oh, she sort

341
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:46,573
of shimmies in
through the doorway,

342
00:16:46,683 --> 00:16:48,775
19 years old.

343
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:50,350
Pure sex.

344
00:16:50,451 --> 00:16:51,348
She says,

345
00:16:51,452 --> 00:16:53,682
"Anyone got a match?"

346
00:16:53,788 --> 00:16:56,483
And Bogie* throws the matches at her...
(*Humphrey Bogart)

347
00:16:56,991 --> 00:16:58,890
and she catches them.

348
00:16:58,992 --> 00:17:02,553
Greatest romance of the century.

349
00:17:02,662 --> 00:17:04,824
How'd it start?
Lighting a cigarette.

350
00:17:04,932 --> 00:17:07,400
These days when someone
smokes in the movies,

351
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:10,731
they're either a psychopath
or a European.

352
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:12,738
The message Hollywood
needs to send out

353
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,807
is smoking is cool.

354
00:17:14,907 --> 00:17:17,205
<i>We need the cast of Will and Grace</i>

355
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:18,674
smoking in their living room.

356
00:17:18,777 --> 00:17:21,007
Forrest Gump puffing away
between his box of chocolates.

357
00:17:21,111 --> 00:17:24,512
Hugh Grant earning back
the love of Julia Roberts

358
00:17:24,616 --> 00:17:28,915
by buying her favorite brand-
her Virginia Slims.

359
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:32,546
Most of the actors smoke already.

360
00:17:32,655 --> 00:17:34,885
If they start doing it on-screen,

361
00:17:34,991 --> 00:17:37,687
we can put the sex
back into cigarettes.

362
00:17:37,794 --> 00:17:40,353
Well, it's a thought.

363
00:17:40,462 --> 00:17:42,258
I was hoping for something
a little more inspiring,

364
00:17:42,363 --> 00:17:43,387
but at least you're thinking.

365
00:17:43,498 --> 00:17:44,862
Rest of you people,
slam your fucking brains

366
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:45,864
against your desks

367
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:48,562
until something useful comes out.

368
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:50,568
That was awesome.

369
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,694
Thank you.

370
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:53,796
Nick, you've been summoned.

371
00:17:53,908 --> 00:17:54,896
Captain wants to see you.

372
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,339
<i>He saw the Joan show.</i>

373
00:17:56,444 --> 00:17:57,536
What'd he think?

374
00:17:57,644 --> 00:17:59,442
Get your ass on the next flight
to Winston-Salem.

375
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:04,916
<i>Most people have this image
in their heads</i>

376
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,111
<i>of tobacco executives
jet-setting around the world</i>

377
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,413
<i>on private planes,
eating foie gras</i>

378
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,885
<i>as they count their money.</i>

379
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:13,115
<i>Not me.</i>

380
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:15,522
<i>I like to ride with the people.</i>

381
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,150
<i>Know your clients.</i>

382
00:18:17,261 --> 00:18:19,456
<i>My people cram themselves
into a tiny seat,</i>

383
00:18:19,564 --> 00:18:21,427
<i>pop a Xanax and dream
of the moment</i>

384
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:24,465
<i>they can stuff their face
with fresh tobacco.</i>

385
00:18:24,568 --> 00:18:27,331
<i>If I can convince just one of
these kids to pick up smoking,</i>

386
00:18:27,436 --> 00:18:29,701
<i>I've paid for my flight-round-trip.</i>

387
00:18:38,146 --> 00:18:41,945
<i>The Captain is the last great
man of tobacco.</i>

388
00:18:42,048 --> 00:18:43,777
<i>He introduced filters</i>

389
00:18:43,884 --> 00:18:47,341
<i>when cigarettes first got
slammed by Reader's Digest.</i>

390
00:18:47,454 --> 00:18:51,821
<i>Later, he founded
the Academy of Tobacco Studies.</i>

391
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:54,792
<i>The club was founded
by the tobacco barons in 1890</i>

392
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:58,328
<i>so they'd have a place
to get away from their wives.</i>

393
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:04,292
<i>Here, the Captain is a legend-</i>

394
00:19:04,401 --> 00:19:06,734
<i>a self-made man who started
from nothing,</i>

395
00:19:06,836 --> 00:19:09,635
<i>and ended up with everything...</i>

396
00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:12,936
<i>except, evidently, a son.</i>

397
00:19:13,043 --> 00:19:15,272
Nick, my boy.

398
00:19:15,378 --> 00:19:18,472
You're just in time for mud.

399
00:19:18,581 --> 00:19:20,172
Thank you.

400
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:21,976
Sit down there. Yeah.

401
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:26,513
Yeah.

402
00:19:26,621 --> 00:19:28,612
You know the secret
to a really good julep?

403
00:19:28,722 --> 00:19:30,418
No, sir.

404
00:19:30,524 --> 00:19:32,890
Well, you crush the mint

405
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:36,086
down onto the ice with your thumb

406
00:19:36,196 --> 00:19:38,630
and you grind it in, see?

407
00:19:38,732 --> 00:19:41,360
And it releases the menthol.

408
00:19:42,969 --> 00:19:43,958
Hmm.

409
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,468
Now you know who taught me that?

410
00:19:45,571 --> 00:19:46,503
No, sir. Who?

411
00:19:46,605 --> 00:19:48,402
Fidel Castro.

412
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,968
Do you remember 1952?

413
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:58,310
Well, sir, I wasn't alive in 1952.

414
00:19:58,415 --> 00:20:03,147
Good Lord, I was in Korea
shooting Chinese in 1952.

415
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:05,413
Really?

416
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:07,786
Today they're our best customer.

417
00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:10,519
Next time we won't have to shoot
so many of them, will we?

418
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,354
<i>No, sir.</i>

419
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:16,453
<i>1952 was the year
Reader's Digest</i>

420
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:19,431
nailed us with
the whole health aspect.

421
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:22,023
As Churchill said,

422
00:20:22,135 --> 00:20:24,399
that was perhaps the end
of our beginning.

423
00:20:24,505 --> 00:20:27,837
Tell me,

424
00:20:27,941 --> 00:20:29,875
do you enjoy your current work, Nick?

425
00:20:29,976 --> 00:20:30,943
Yes, sir.

426
00:20:31,044 --> 00:20:32,476
It's challenging...

427
00:20:32,578 --> 00:20:36,173
If you can do tobacco,
you can do anything.

428
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,114
Yes, sir, I like that.

429
00:20:39,218 --> 00:20:41,617
You know, Nick, you remind me

430
00:20:41,718 --> 00:20:43,948
just a little bit
of myself when I was your age.

431
00:20:44,054 --> 00:20:46,682
Well, thank you, sir.

432
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,621
Like that Joan Lunden show you did.

433
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:50,990
You could have given up,
cried, apologized,

434
00:20:51,095 --> 00:20:52,083
but you didn't.

435
00:20:52,194 --> 00:20:54,128
You stayed loyal.

436
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:59,099
And you gave it
to that son of a bitch good.

437
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:01,761
<i>My pleasure.</i>

438
00:21:04,906 --> 00:21:08,068
Now, BR's come under the idea

439
00:21:08,175 --> 00:21:10,938
that we should start bribing
producers in Hollywood

440
00:21:11,045 --> 00:21:14,707
to make the actors smoke on screen.

441
00:21:14,814 --> 00:21:17,807
You know, like in the old days.

442
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:20,182
Say, that's, uh...

443
00:21:20,286 --> 00:21:22,550
that's a great idea.

444
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,087
Mm-hmm.

445
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:25,713
Smart man, that BR.

446
00:21:25,825 --> 00:21:27,348
Oh, yeah, yeah.

447
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,983
And loyal.

448
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,543
Yes, sir?

449
00:21:49,645 --> 00:21:51,510
Have a seat, Ron.

450
00:22:02,256 --> 00:22:06,657
You, see, Ron, I can't be
everywhere I'm needed.

451
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,659
That's why I send
people like you

452
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:10,093
to speak on my behalf.

453
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:13,859
When you're there,
you're not Ron Goode,

454
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,934
the guy your friends probably like,

455
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:18,594
you're Senator Finistirre's aide,

456
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:21,968
and your name really doesn't matter.

457
00:22:22,073 --> 00:22:23,972
So, when

458
00:22:24,074 --> 00:22:26,770
Ron Goode acts
like a complete asshole

459
00:22:26,877 --> 00:22:29,573
<i>on the Joan Lunden Show,</i>

460
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,774
<i>I am being an asshole
on the Joan Lunden Show.</i>

461
00:22:32,882 --> 00:22:34,543
Senator, sir, he sprang on me like...

462
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,847
Where in the hell
did you find cancer boy?

463
00:22:37,954 --> 00:22:40,387
He was supposed to be quite reliable.

464
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:43,323
The Pulmonary Council
was one of his references.

465
00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:45,119
Fucking nonprofits.

466
00:22:48,863 --> 00:22:51,593
When you're looking
for a cancer kid,

467
00:22:51,698 --> 00:22:52,996
he should be hopeless.

468
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,657
He should have a wheelchair.

469
00:22:54,766 --> 00:22:56,928
He should have trouble talking.

470
00:22:57,036 --> 00:22:59,766
He should have
a little pet goldfish

471
00:22:59,873 --> 00:23:01,465
he carries around
in a ziplock bag-

472
00:23:01,574 --> 00:23:02,633
hopeless.

473
00:23:02,742 --> 00:23:05,004
I apologize, sir, but if it wasn't

474
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,441
- for Nick Naylor...
- Nick Naylor?

475
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:12,715
Don't you even think
of using him as an excuse.

476
00:23:12,817 --> 00:23:14,807
The man shills bullshit for a living.

477
00:23:14,918 --> 00:23:16,887
You work for a fucking senator.

478
00:23:16,987 --> 00:23:19,251
A senator who is supposed
to be tough on tobacco.

479
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:22,223
Have a little... pride,
for God's sake.

480
00:23:22,326 --> 00:23:26,556
It won't happen again, sir,
I promise.

481
00:23:29,198 --> 00:23:32,725
All right, you're excused.

482
00:23:38,605 --> 00:23:39,936
<i>Sometimes I feel like</i>

483
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,736
a Colombian drug dealer.

484
00:23:44,545 --> 00:23:49,106
The other day, my own granddaughter,
flesh of flesh of my own loins,

485
00:23:49,215 --> 00:23:52,582
asked me, "Granddaddy, is it true

486
00:23:52,685 --> 00:23:55,550
cigarettes are bad for you?"

487
00:23:57,957 --> 00:24:00,516
We got to do something, Nick.

488
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:01,887
I think you're our man.

489
00:24:01,993 --> 00:24:03,721
Thank you, sir.

490
00:24:03,828 --> 00:24:06,090
I want you to work
on this Hollywood project.

491
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:08,686
Get out there the next
few weeks, stir things up

492
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,734
and report directly to me.

493
00:24:12,835 --> 00:24:13,893
Sir, about the,

494
00:24:14,003 --> 00:24:17,063
the $50 million.

495
00:24:17,171 --> 00:24:20,073
Anti teen-smoking advertising.

496
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:23,668
Well, shit, I sure hope
it's not too persuasive.

497
00:24:25,348 --> 00:24:26,473
I hope.

498
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,922
Nick,

499
00:24:39,024 --> 00:24:40,889
you're family now.

500
00:24:40,993 --> 00:24:43,621
Tobacco takes care of its own, eh?

501
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,663
Thank you, sir.

502
00:24:58,573 --> 00:24:59,506
Mr. Naylor?

503
00:24:59,609 --> 00:25:00,598
Hi.

504
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,144
Hi. Welcome to Tobacco One.

505
00:25:02,245 --> 00:25:03,507
Thank you.

506
00:25:03,614 --> 00:25:06,241
The captain told me to take
extra special care of you today.

507
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:08,783
So if there is anything
at all I can do

508
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,146
to make your flight
more pleasant,

509
00:25:10,252 --> 00:25:13,518
you be sure and let me know now.

510
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:26,790
BR.

511
00:25:26,898 --> 00:25:27,796
Pleasant flight?

512
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:29,992
Oh! You could say that.

513
00:25:30,103 --> 00:25:31,866
Came up on the Captain's plane.

514
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,870
Oh, it's quite the way to travel.

515
00:25:33,973 --> 00:25:35,838
I wouldn't know.

516
00:25:35,942 --> 00:25:37,203
No? You never been on Tobacco One

517
00:25:37,308 --> 00:25:40,540
with those seats, that kitchen,

518
00:25:40,646 --> 00:25:42,306
that stewardess, Tiffany?

519
00:25:42,414 --> 00:25:44,439
Haven't had the chance yet.

520
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:45,844
Oh, well, you really must try it.

521
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,008
It's the only way to travel.

522
00:25:48,118 --> 00:25:51,348
What'd he think of your $50 million
anti-smoking campaign?

523
00:25:51,454 --> 00:25:53,387
Oh, the $50 million
anti teen-smoking campaign?

524
00:25:53,489 --> 00:25:54,387
Yeah.

525
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,651
Yeah, he gave that the go-ahead.

526
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:56,919
Oh, and he loved your idea

527
00:25:57,026 --> 00:25:58,323
to put cigarettes back into movies.

528
00:25:58,427 --> 00:26:00,987
- That was your idea.
- Oh, yeah?

529
00:26:01,095 --> 00:26:03,223
- He must have gotten confused.
- Hmm.

530
00:26:03,332 --> 00:26:07,734
Yeah. Well, either way,
he was pretty blown away.

531
00:26:07,835 --> 00:26:10,495
Right. Well, get a flight to L.A.

532
00:26:10,604 --> 00:26:11,696
I'll get you a meeting
with Jeff Megall.

533
00:26:11,805 --> 00:26:12,828
Who?

534
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,200
Hollywood super agent.

535
00:26:14,308 --> 00:26:17,970
Runs the agency EGO:
Entertainment Global Offices.

536
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,635
<i>This guy is the entertainment business.</i>

537
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,009
And you are cigarettes, BR.

538
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:23,979
Whatever.

539
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,711
Yeah, but it's not a vacation,
it's a learning experience.

540
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,877
And California is one
of the fastest-growing

541
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,182
states, it's got

542
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:32,984
the largest number of electoral
votes in the country.

543
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,888
I mean, this could be
a very good trip for Joey.

544
00:26:35,993 --> 00:26:37,324
You know what?
Don't smooth-talk me.

545
00:26:37,427 --> 00:26:38,416
You're not going to
take him sightseeing.

546
00:26:38,527 --> 00:26:39,586
You're probably going

547
00:26:39,695 --> 00:26:41,687
to take him
to some lung cancer symposium

548
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:43,732
where a guy with an electronic
voice box will tell him

549
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:44,992
that his father is the devil.

550
00:26:45,101 --> 00:26:46,261
That's unfair.

551
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:47,665
Unfair? What about Virginia?

552
00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:49,134
And what about Virginia?

553
00:26:49,237 --> 00:26:51,000
You took him to a cigarette factory.

554
00:26:51,106 --> 00:26:52,971
No, I took him to a tobacco farm.

555
00:26:53,075 --> 00:26:54,269
That's hardly the same thing.

556
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:56,366
This conversation's over.

557
00:27:00,313 --> 00:27:02,338
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

558
00:27:02,515 --> 00:27:05,177
Last week we had another
disgruntled postman.

559
00:27:05,286 --> 00:27:06,274
Of course,

560
00:27:06,386 --> 00:27:07,546
<i>an hour later the Washington Post</i>

561
00:27:07,653 --> 00:27:10,451
is calling me on the phone-
godless swine.

562
00:27:10,556 --> 00:27:12,080
I said to 'em, I says,

563
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:16,218
"Now if a plane crashes
on account of pilot error,

564
00:27:16,328 --> 00:27:17,692
do you blame the Boeing Corporation?"

565
00:27:17,795 --> 00:27:18,784
Nice.

566
00:27:18,896 --> 00:27:20,261
- That's a good one.
- Thank you.

567
00:27:20,366 --> 00:27:22,925
If some booze-besotten drunk
runs someone down,

568
00:27:23,034 --> 00:27:24,968
do you go banging on the doors
at General Motors?

569
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,399
Tell me you didn't say that.

570
00:27:26,503 --> 00:27:27,868
Mm-hmm.

571
00:27:27,972 --> 00:27:29,961
Have either of you heard of a
reporter named Heather Holloway?

572
00:27:30,071 --> 00:27:33,235
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Irish type.

573
00:27:33,342 --> 00:27:34,706
Brown hair, big blue eyes.

574
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:35,902
Nice skin.

575
00:27:36,011 --> 00:27:37,035
Amazing tits.

576
00:27:37,146 --> 00:27:39,909
Tits? Why are tits relevant?

577
00:27:40,015 --> 00:27:41,345
Hmm, let's see.

578
00:27:41,449 --> 00:27:44,212
World-class tits on a reporter
interviewing a man

579
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:47,152
with privileged information
are relevant.

580
00:27:47,255 --> 00:27:49,245
How about it, Nick?
Are you a tit man?

581
00:27:49,356 --> 00:27:51,154
Don't answer that.
That's a trap.

582
00:27:51,258 --> 00:27:54,055
Depends whose tits.

583
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,957
Look, just don't get screwed,
all right?

584
00:27:56,062 --> 00:27:59,031
Bobby, I think I can handle
a good-looking girl reporter.

585
00:27:59,132 --> 00:28:00,758
Thank you.

586
00:28:09,974 --> 00:28:10,998
Heather Holloway.

587
00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:12,838
Nick Naylor, big tobacco.

588
00:28:14,545 --> 00:28:16,741
Is this kosher?

589
00:28:16,847 --> 00:28:18,781
Only if I can call you "Heather."

590
00:28:18,882 --> 00:28:21,145
By all means.

591
00:28:23,752 --> 00:28:24,741
So, Mr. Naylor...

592
00:28:24,853 --> 00:28:26,947
- Nick.
- Nick.

593
00:28:27,055 --> 00:28:29,080
Let's start with...

594
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:30,521
An '82 Margaux.

595
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,651
Okay. Is it good?

596
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,196
Good? It'll make you believe in God.

597
00:28:49,942 --> 00:28:52,432
So what is the focus of your piece?

598
00:28:52,545 --> 00:28:54,375
- You.
- Really?

599
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,311
You want to know how I live
with myself.

600
00:28:56,415 --> 00:29:00,145
No. I don't imagine
that's much of a problem.

601
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,480
I want to know how you see yourself.

602
00:29:02,587 --> 00:29:03,781
I'm...

603
00:29:03,888 --> 00:29:06,652
a mediator between two sects
of society

604
00:29:06,757 --> 00:29:08,452
that are trying
to reach an accommodation.

605
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,423
Interesting.

606
00:29:10,526 --> 00:29:14,189
My other interviews have pinned
you as a mass murderer,

607
00:29:14,297 --> 00:29:17,357
bloodsucker, pimp,
profiteer, child killer,

608
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:20,731
and my personal favorite
"yuppie Mephistopheles."

609
00:29:20,836 --> 00:29:23,963
Wow, that sounds
like a balanced article.

610
00:29:24,071 --> 00:29:26,131
Who else should I talk to?

611
00:29:26,241 --> 00:29:28,368
55 million American smokers,
for starters

612
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:31,342
or perhaps
the American tobacco farmer

613
00:29:31,445 --> 00:29:33,570
who is constantly being treated
like a drug smuggler.

614
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,078
I actually do plan on speaking
to a tobacco farmer.

615
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,170
Good.

616
00:29:36,281 --> 00:29:38,341
They're fine people,
salt of the earth.

617
00:29:38,451 --> 00:29:40,850
Nick, why do you do this?

618
00:29:40,952 --> 00:29:42,613
What motivates you?

619
00:29:49,127 --> 00:29:51,218
You really want to know?

620
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:52,489
Mm-hmm.

621
00:29:52,597 --> 00:29:53,621
Really?

622
00:29:53,731 --> 00:29:55,528
Mm-hmm.

623
00:29:55,633 --> 00:30:00,262
<i>Population control.</i>

624
00:30:04,205 --> 00:30:05,298
You're bad.

625
00:30:07,743 --> 00:30:09,869
Everyone's got a mortgage to pay.

626
00:30:09,978 --> 00:30:12,208
<i>The yuppie Nuremberg defense.</i>

627
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:15,839
So is a mortgage that much
of a life goal?

628
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:20,247
Well, 99% of everything done
in the world, good or bad,

629
00:30:20,353 --> 00:30:22,877
is done to pay a mortgage,
so perhaps the world

630
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:25,012
would be a better place
if everyone rented.

631
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:27,215
Then why don't you rent?

632
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,122
Mm. Well, I rent as well.

633
00:30:29,226 --> 00:30:30,693
- Really?
- Yeah.

634
00:30:30,794 --> 00:30:33,059
My son and his mother
and her boyfriend

635
00:30:33,163 --> 00:30:34,131
live in my house.

636
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,355
I live in my apartment.

637
00:30:35,465 --> 00:30:38,958
What does Nick Naylor's
apartment look like?

638
00:30:39,069 --> 00:30:41,503
I don't know.
It's nothing impressive.

639
00:30:41,604 --> 00:30:42,968
It wouldn't make
the real estate section.

640
00:30:44,073 --> 00:30:45,835
Can I see it?

641
00:30:48,477 --> 00:30:50,205
You want to see my apartment?

642
00:30:50,311 --> 00:30:53,211
I'd like to see
where the devil sleeps.

643
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,646
<i>I know what
You're probably thinking.</i>

644
00:31:04,224 --> 00:31:06,350
<i>This is a bad idea, right?</i>

645
00:31:09,095 --> 00:31:10,722
<i>I mean, come on.</i>

646
00:31:10,831 --> 00:31:11,922
<i>It's not that bad of an idea.</i>

647
00:31:26,577 --> 00:31:28,134
Mom, why can't I go

648
00:31:28,244 --> 00:31:30,303
to California?

649
00:31:30,413 --> 00:31:33,848
Because California's
just not a... safe place.

650
00:31:33,949 --> 00:31:36,474
And besides,
I'm not sure it's appropriate

651
00:31:36,585 --> 00:31:39,816
for your father to bring you
on a business trip.

652
00:31:39,921 --> 00:31:41,353
Appropriate for who?

653
00:31:41,455 --> 00:31:43,422
What?

654
00:31:43,523 --> 00:31:45,821
Mom, is it possible that
you're taking the frustration

655
00:31:45,925 --> 00:31:47,790
of your failed marriage out on me?

656
00:31:48,862 --> 00:31:51,331
Excuse me?

657
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:53,694
This California trip seems like
a great learning opportunity

658
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,597
and a chance for me
to get to know my father.

659
00:31:56,703 --> 00:31:58,432
But if you think it's more important

660
00:31:58,537 --> 00:32:00,403
to use me to channel your frustration

661
00:32:00,507 --> 00:32:02,407
against the man you no longer love,

662
00:32:02,508 --> 00:32:04,168
I'll understand.

663
00:32:09,213 --> 00:32:11,147
How'd you convince her?

664
00:32:11,248 --> 00:32:13,443
It was an argument,
not a negotiation.

665
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:15,177
That's my boy.

666
00:33:01,491 --> 00:33:03,152
Nick?

667
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,385
Nick, Jack, Jeff's assistant. Hey.

668
00:33:05,495 --> 00:33:07,758
How was your flight?
Are you jet-lagged at all?

669
00:33:07,864 --> 00:33:09,558
It's, like, 2:00 in D.C.
Right now.

670
00:33:09,665 --> 00:33:11,133
You know what?
Take some vitamin B.

671
00:33:11,234 --> 00:33:12,461
Jeff swears by it- in fact,

672
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:14,229
I'm gonna hook you up
with an injection.

673
00:33:14,335 --> 00:33:15,735
Who's this with you?
How are you, dude? What's going on?

674
00:33:15,838 --> 00:33:16,930
You guys ever been to L.A. Before?

675
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:18,870
You want to head back
to Jeff's office?

676
00:33:18,973 --> 00:33:21,340
In fact, we probably should-
He's a punctual being.

677
00:33:21,443 --> 00:33:24,273
We actually had some problems at first
with the exterior mirrored glass.

678
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,937
The reflection of the sun was causing
head-on collisions on Wilshire.

679
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:28,638
Oh, is everybody all right?

680
00:33:28,748 --> 00:33:30,909
Yeah, they got three-picture deals
at Paramount- I'm sure they'll live.

681
00:33:31,017 --> 00:33:32,244
- It's a nice building.
- Yeah?

682
00:33:32,351 --> 00:33:34,217
Hey, tell Jeff you think so, okay?

683
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,845
'Cause he just put a lot
of himself into this building.

684
00:33:36,955 --> 00:33:40,392
And you know something?
It really shows.

685
00:33:40,493 --> 00:33:42,051
What's up, Hiroshi?

686
00:33:42,161 --> 00:33:45,926
Keep going- that sand's
not gonna rake itself.

687
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,054
All right, come here,
this is my favorite part.

688
00:33:48,164 --> 00:33:51,396
That one right there?
It's $7,000.

689
00:33:51,502 --> 00:33:53,527
<i>- $7,000 for a fish?
- Yep.</i>

690
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:55,537
Kind of makes you want
to stop eating sushi,

691
00:33:55,638 --> 00:33:57,265
but I guess you kind of have to.

692
00:33:57,373 --> 00:33:59,204
Hey, you see that
big white one right there?

693
00:33:59,308 --> 00:34:02,073
Swear to you- $12,000,
gift from Oprah.

694
00:34:02,177 --> 00:34:05,976
It's a Chamberlain- office-warming gift
from Matthew McConaughey.

695
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,446
Generous gift.

696
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:09,574
<i>Yeah. Right!</i>

697
00:34:09,683 --> 00:34:12,515
Don't get me wrong, Matthew is
a tremendously talented individual

698
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,110
and an extremely decent human being,

699
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:16,745
however, before Jeff
took him on, he was a face.

700
00:34:16,856 --> 00:34:18,085
Now he's a name.

701
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:24,629
Do you hear that?

702
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:29,198
No.

703
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:32,499
Exactly.

704
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:42,743
Hey, Neal.

705
00:34:42,846 --> 00:34:45,110
Neal, I'm gonna impale
your mom on a spike,

706
00:34:45,215 --> 00:34:47,876
and I'm gonna feed her dead body
to my dog with syphilis.

707
00:34:47,983 --> 00:34:49,747
<i>Aw, Jack, you got me!</i>

708
00:34:49,852 --> 00:34:51,513
That guy!

709
00:34:51,621 --> 00:34:54,316
It's an inside joke.

710
00:34:54,424 --> 00:34:56,687
<i>So, as you can see,</i>

711
00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:58,986
Jeff just really loves Asian shit.

712
00:34:59,093 --> 00:35:00,822
Uh, Candace, is he ready?

713
00:35:00,929 --> 00:35:02,590
- Mm-hmm.
- Fantastic.

714
00:35:02,697 --> 00:35:04,960
<i>Okay, Joey,
I'm gonna bring your dad in now.</i>

715
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:07,089
Is there anything I can get
you while you're waiting,

716
00:35:07,198 --> 00:35:09,394
like an orange juice
or a coffee or a Red Bull?

717
00:35:09,502 --> 00:35:11,901
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

718
00:35:14,408 --> 00:35:16,375
Wow, it's a great office.

719
00:35:16,474 --> 00:35:18,465
Yeah. Jeff basically designed
the whole thing.

720
00:35:18,577 --> 00:35:20,477
The architect just made the drawings.

721
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:22,945
Jack, stop it.

722
00:35:23,048 --> 00:35:24,345
Next you're gonna be telling him

723
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,939
what position I played
for the Bruins.

724
00:35:26,051 --> 00:35:26,948
<i>Quarterback.</i>

725
00:35:27,051 --> 00:35:28,313
Jeff Megall.

726
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,645
Nick Naylor.

727
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,983
Mr. Naylor's here to see
if we can't get cigarettes

728
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:34,613
- into the hands of somebody
other than the usual RAVs.
- Sure.

729
00:35:34,724 --> 00:35:37,214
- RAVs?
- Russians, Arabs and Villains.

730
00:35:37,326 --> 00:35:39,054
Oh, well, then yes, I guess
that is why I'm here.

731
00:35:39,161 --> 00:35:41,356
Good. I think we can help.

732
00:35:41,464 --> 00:35:43,557
Jeff invented product placement.

733
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:45,633
I feel I have to ask, uh...

734
00:35:45,734 --> 00:35:48,726
Are you concerned at
all about the, um...

735
00:35:48,836 --> 00:35:50,394
about the health element?

736
00:35:50,504 --> 00:35:53,371
I'm not a doctor, I'm a facilitator.

737
00:35:53,474 --> 00:35:54,736
I bring creative people together.

738
00:35:54,842 --> 00:35:57,035
Whatever information there is,
exists, it's out there.

739
00:35:57,142 --> 00:35:58,336
People will decide for themselves.

740
00:35:58,445 --> 00:36:00,878
They should. It's not
my role to decide for them.

741
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,880
It'd be morally presumptuous.

742
00:36:02,983 --> 00:36:05,543
<i>I could learn a lot
from this man.</i>

743
00:36:05,651 --> 00:36:08,017
Now, what we need is
a smoking role model,

744
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,052
a real winner.

745
00:36:09,153 --> 00:36:10,849
Indiana Jones meets Jerry Maguire.

746
00:36:10,956 --> 00:36:12,013
Right, on two packs a day.

747
00:36:12,124 --> 00:36:14,149
Only he can't live
in contemporary society.

748
00:36:14,258 --> 00:36:15,156
Why not?

749
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,249
The health issue's way too prevalent.

750
00:36:17,362 --> 00:36:19,295
People would constantly
be asking the character

751
00:36:19,397 --> 00:36:21,659
why he's smoking-
and that should go unsaid.

752
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:23,699
How do you feel about the future?

753
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,995
The future?

754
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:27,831
Yeah, after the health thing's
blown over.

755
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:29,267
A world
where smokers and nonsmokers

756
00:36:29,372 --> 00:36:30,771
live together in perfect harmony.

757
00:36:30,872 --> 00:36:33,238
Sony has a futuristic sci-fi movie
they're looking to make.

758
00:36:33,342 --> 00:36:35,276
<i>Message From Sector Six.</i>

759
00:36:35,379 --> 00:36:37,401
All takes place in a space station.

760
00:36:37,511 --> 00:36:39,376
They're actively looking
for some co-financing.

761
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,948
So cigarettes in space?

762
00:36:41,049 --> 00:36:43,176
It's the final frontier, Nick.

763
00:36:43,283 --> 00:36:45,273
But wouldn't they blow up
in an all-oxygen environment?

764
00:36:46,353 --> 00:36:48,080
Probably.

765
00:36:48,187 --> 00:36:50,780
But it's an easy fix-
one line of dialogue:

766
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:52,857
"Thank God we invented the..."
you know,

767
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:54,256
whatever device.

768
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,224
Brad Pitt.

769
00:36:56,329 --> 00:36:57,886
Catherine Zeta-Jones.

770
00:36:57,996 --> 00:36:59,395
They've just finished ravishing

771
00:36:59,498 --> 00:37:02,091
each other's bodies
for the first time.

772
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,225
They lie naked, suspended in air

773
00:37:04,336 --> 00:37:05,769
underneath the heavens.

774
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,236
Pitt lights up.

775
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:10,068
He starts blowing smoke rings
all around

776
00:37:10,174 --> 00:37:11,970
Catherine's naked, flawless body,

777
00:37:12,075 --> 00:37:15,238
as the galaxies go whizzing
by over the glass-domed ceiling.

778
00:37:15,345 --> 00:37:17,404
Now, tell me that
doesn't work for you.

779
00:37:17,514 --> 00:37:18,809
I'd see that movie.

780
00:37:18,913 --> 00:37:20,175
I'd buy the goddamn DVD.

781
00:37:20,282 --> 00:37:22,977
You know, if the academy
didn't send them to me for free.

782
00:37:23,085 --> 00:37:24,552
You know,

783
00:37:24,653 --> 00:37:26,814
you guys ought to think
about designing a cigarette

784
00:37:26,922 --> 00:37:28,650
to be released simultaneously
with the movie.

785
00:37:28,756 --> 00:37:30,313
Sector Sixes.

786
00:37:30,425 --> 00:37:31,982
No one's ever done it
with a cigarette.

787
00:37:32,092 --> 00:37:33,219
Wow.

788
00:37:33,327 --> 00:37:35,227
Well, where do we go from here?

789
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:38,161
You enjoy the rest of your day
in L.A. with your son

790
00:37:38,264 --> 00:37:40,198
while I find out
the answers to these questions.

791
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,927
Hey, where can I get
a bite to eat with my son?

792
00:37:43,035 --> 00:37:44,559
You ought to try Nobu's new place.

793
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,070
- He only serves food that's white.
- Oh, great.

794
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,569
<i>So, you go to an office,</i>

795
00:37:50,675 --> 00:37:53,303
<i>then you go on TV
and talk about cigarettes.</i>

796
00:37:53,412 --> 00:37:55,243
<i>Then you fly out to L.A.</i>

797
00:37:55,346 --> 00:37:57,814
To talk to some guy who
works with movie stars.

798
00:37:57,916 --> 00:38:01,213
- What is that?
- That's my job; I'm a lobbyist.

799
00:38:01,316 --> 00:38:03,978
I know, but did you study to do that?

800
00:38:04,087 --> 00:38:06,579
No. No, I just kind of figured it out.

801
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,781
Then can't anyone just do that?

802
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:12,826
No, it, uh, requires a...

803
00:38:12,928 --> 00:38:16,659
a moral flexibility
that goes beyond most people.

804
00:38:17,766 --> 00:38:20,598
Do I have flexible morals?

805
00:38:20,701 --> 00:38:23,397
Well, let's say
you became a lawyer, right?

806
00:38:23,504 --> 00:38:25,131
And you were asked
to defend a murderer.

807
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:26,762
Worse than that- a child murderer.

808
00:38:26,873 --> 00:38:28,171
Now,

809
00:38:28,274 --> 00:38:31,265
the law states that every person
deserves a fair trial.

810
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:33,469
Would you defend them?

811
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,274
I don't know.
I guess every person

812
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,211
- deserves a fair defense.
- Yeah, well,

813
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:39,442
so do multinational corporations.

814
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:42,849
So, what happens when you're wrong?

815
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:44,615
<i>Well, Joey, I'm never wrong.</i>

816
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,189
But you can't always be right.

817
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,225
Well, if it's your job to be right,
then you're never wrong.

818
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,521
<i>But what if you are wrong?</i>

819
00:38:51,628 --> 00:38:53,787
Okay, let's say that
you're defending chocolate

820
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:55,227
and I'm defending vanilla.

821
00:38:55,331 --> 00:38:57,731
Now, if I were to say to you,

822
00:38:57,833 --> 00:39:00,733
"Vanilla's the best flavor
ice cream," you'd say...?

823
00:39:00,835 --> 00:39:02,895
- "No, chocolate is."
- Exactly.

824
00:39:03,004 --> 00:39:04,596
But you can't win that argument.

825
00:39:04,706 --> 00:39:07,266
So, I'll ask you-
So you think chocolate

826
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:10,172
is the end-all and be-all
of ice cream, do you?

827
00:39:10,278 --> 00:39:12,336
It's the best ice cream;
I wouldn't order any other.

828
00:39:12,447 --> 00:39:14,347
Oh. So it's all chocolate
for you, is it?

829
00:39:14,448 --> 00:39:16,040
Yes, chocolate is all I need.

830
00:39:16,151 --> 00:39:17,446
Well, I need more than chocolate.

831
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,542
And for that matter,
I need more than vanilla.

832
00:39:19,652 --> 00:39:21,414
I believe that we need
freedom and choice

833
00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:24,011
when it comes to our ice cream,
and that, Joey Naylor,

834
00:39:24,122 --> 00:39:25,647
that is the definition of liberty.

835
00:39:25,757 --> 00:39:27,691
But that's not what
we're talking about.

836
00:39:27,793 --> 00:39:30,193
<i>Ah, but that's what
I'm talking about.</i>

837
00:39:30,295 --> 00:39:33,230
- But... you didn't prove that vanilla's the best.
- I didn't have to.

838
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:36,163
I proved that you're wrong-
and if you're wrong, I'm right.

839
00:39:36,268 --> 00:39:37,234
But you still didn't

840
00:39:37,335 --> 00:39:38,392
convince me.

841
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:39,834
'Cause I'm not after you.

842
00:39:39,937 --> 00:39:43,235
I'm after them.

843
00:39:59,321 --> 00:40:00,786
Hello?

844
00:40:00,887 --> 00:40:02,787
Thought I'd give you a little update.

845
00:40:02,889 --> 00:40:04,857
Jeff. You still at the office?

846
00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:07,484
Do you know what time it is
in Tokyo right now?

847
00:40:07,594 --> 00:40:09,357
- No.
- 4:00 p.m. Tomorrow.

848
00:40:09,462 --> 00:40:11,258
It's the future, Nick.

849
00:40:12,463 --> 00:40:14,192
Anyway, for Pitt to smoke,

850
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,530
it's $10 million;
for the pair, it's 25.

851
00:40:16,634 --> 00:40:19,797
25?! Usually when I buy two
of something, I get a discount.

852
00:40:19,905 --> 00:40:21,098
What's the extra five for?

853
00:40:21,207 --> 00:40:22,365
Synergy.

854
00:40:22,473 --> 00:40:25,236
These are not stupid people;
they got it right away.

855
00:40:25,343 --> 00:40:27,572
Pitt and Zeta-Jones lighting up
after some cosmic fucking

856
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:30,147
in the bubble suite's
gonna sell a lot of cigarettes.

857
00:40:30,248 --> 00:40:31,679
Well, for that kind of money,

858
00:40:31,782 --> 00:40:33,681
my people will expect
some very serious smoking.

859
00:40:33,783 --> 00:40:35,274
Can Brad blow smoke rings?

860
00:40:35,383 --> 00:40:36,783
I don't have that information.

861
00:40:36,886 --> 00:40:38,581
Well, for $25 million,
we'd want smoke rings.

862
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:40,177
Oh, one other thing-
you'll be cofinancing

863
00:40:40,289 --> 00:40:42,221
the picture
with the Sultan of Glutan.

864
00:40:42,323 --> 00:40:43,518
The Sultan of Glutan?

865
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:45,651
The one who massacred
and enslaved his own people?

866
00:40:45,759 --> 00:40:48,251
Aren't they calling him
the Hitler of the South Pacific?

867
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,797
No, I can't speak to that-
All my dealings with him,

868
00:40:50,898 --> 00:40:52,626
he's been a very reasonable
and sensitive guy.

869
00:40:52,733 --> 00:40:53,961
He's fun. You'll like him.

870
00:40:54,068 --> 00:40:55,261
I better run it by my people.

871
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,461
No problem.

872
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:57,935
<i>Oh, that's London calling.</i>

873
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,164
7:00 a.m. In the Old Empire.

874
00:41:00,273 --> 00:41:01,830
Jeff, when do you sleep?

875
00:41:01,939 --> 00:41:03,168
Sunday.

876
00:42:05,296 --> 00:42:07,787
- Operator.
- Yeah, my light is blinking.

877
00:42:07,898 --> 00:42:11,130
- There's a package downstairs for you.
- Okay, send it up.

878
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:16,867
Captain, I'm sitting in front
of an open briefcase.

879
00:42:16,972 --> 00:42:18,997
I don't suppose this is a raise.

880
00:42:19,107 --> 00:42:22,906
Now, Nick, do you know
who Lorne Lutch is?

881
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,705
Yeah, of course.
He's the original Marlboro Man.

882
00:42:24,812 --> 00:42:27,280
<i>He's dying.
He was on Sally last week.</i>

883
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:29,577
Not exactly our biggest fan.

884
00:42:29,684 --> 00:42:30,913
Well, the money's for him.

885
00:42:31,018 --> 00:42:33,646
Now, he has a ranch
out there in California.

886
00:42:33,753 --> 00:42:35,414
I want you to bring it to him.

887
00:42:35,523 --> 00:42:39,356
He's a cowboy, sir,
and cowboys don't like bribes.

888
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,620
It's not a bribe. No, sir.

889
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:44,490
You're going out there
on wings of angels, son.

890
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:47,530
You mean we're just going
to give him the money?

891
00:42:47,633 --> 00:42:49,031
Well, I think Christ himself
would say,

892
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:51,364
"That's mighty white of you boys."

893
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:53,528
No gag agreement?

894
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:56,038
Hopefully, he'll be so damn
overcome with gratitude

895
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,471
<i>he'll... he'll have to shut up.</i>

896
00:43:09,217 --> 00:43:11,549
Hey, kiddo, I got to go do
a little bit more work

897
00:43:11,653 --> 00:43:12,745
this afternoon, all right?

898
00:43:12,855 --> 00:43:13,751
Can I come?

899
00:43:13,855 --> 00:43:15,287
No. Not this time.

900
00:43:15,389 --> 00:43:17,550
But I want to see what you do.

901
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,452
You stay here, okay?

902
00:44:19,613 --> 00:44:22,172
What the fuck are you doing here?

903
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,873
Uh... uh...

904
00:44:24,982 --> 00:44:26,678
Do you have a minute?

905
00:44:31,823 --> 00:44:33,484
What do you want?

906
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:34,818
Dad!

907
00:44:34,926 --> 00:44:36,051
Joey, get back in the car.

908
00:44:42,666 --> 00:44:44,656
Just want to talk.

909
00:44:46,002 --> 00:44:48,061
All right.

910
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:49,637
Let's talk.

911
00:45:06,052 --> 00:45:08,486
Pearl, we got company.

912
00:45:11,123 --> 00:45:14,320
Mister, you got a lot of nerve
walking in here after...

913
00:45:14,426 --> 00:45:17,792
Honey, why don't you show
this young man some iced tea?

914
00:45:20,932 --> 00:45:22,422
I'll be right back, tiger.

915
00:45:38,848 --> 00:45:41,407
Saw you on...

916
00:45:41,516 --> 00:45:45,008
Weren't you on that TV show?

917
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,917
Yeah. Yeah, that was me.

918
00:45:48,021 --> 00:45:51,582
You're lucky you made it
out of there alive.

919
00:45:51,692 --> 00:45:53,991
Yeah. Tobacco used to be
all over the television.

920
00:45:54,094 --> 00:45:58,085
Now TV is leading the witch hunt.

921
00:45:58,197 --> 00:46:00,062
Strange business.

922
00:46:00,166 --> 00:46:03,067
Last year, after I was diagnosed,

923
00:46:03,169 --> 00:46:08,696
flew east to attend the
annual stockholders' convention.

924
00:46:10,474 --> 00:46:12,442
Stood up and told them
I thought

925
00:46:12,543 --> 00:46:17,172
they ought to cut back
on their advertising.

926
00:46:17,281 --> 00:46:19,874
You know what your boss said to me?

927
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,180
He said, "We're certainly sorry

928
00:46:26,289 --> 00:46:30,053
"to hear about your medical problem.

929
00:46:30,158 --> 00:46:33,595
"However, without
knowing more

930
00:46:33,695 --> 00:46:37,357
"of your medical history,

931
00:46:37,465 --> 00:46:39,557
we can't comment further."

932
00:46:42,136 --> 00:46:44,366
But then they tried to pretend

933
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:46,200
I never worked for 'em.

934
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:50,371
Yeah, I got the pay stubs.

935
00:46:50,477 --> 00:46:53,240
But, hell,
I was on the damn billboards.

936
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,708
I never
even smoked

937
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:58,839
Marlboro.

938
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:01,418
I smoked Kools.

939
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:08,950
You look like a nice-enough fella.

940
00:47:09,058 --> 00:47:11,356
What are you doing
working for these assholes?

941
00:47:13,262 --> 00:47:15,321
I'm good at it.

942
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:16,660
Better at doing this

943
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:18,427
than I ever was
at doing anything else.

944
00:47:18,534 --> 00:47:20,467
Aw, hell, son.

945
00:47:20,569 --> 00:47:23,129
I was good at shooting VC*.
(* Viet-Cong)

946
00:47:23,238 --> 00:47:25,206
I didn't make it my career.

947
00:47:27,507 --> 00:47:31,170
I suppose we all
got to pay the mortgage.

948
00:47:35,014 --> 00:47:37,176
Your dad always bring
you along like this?

949
00:47:37,283 --> 00:47:40,012
No. I live with my mom.

950
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:41,848
He tell you why he's here today?

951
00:47:41,955 --> 00:47:45,787
He said that your husband
was the Marlboro Man.

952
00:47:47,392 --> 00:47:51,191
Yeah, well, not anymore.

953
00:47:51,294 --> 00:47:52,761
Hello.

954
00:47:52,862 --> 00:47:55,023
Yeah. Hey, can you hold on a second?

955
00:47:55,132 --> 00:47:59,227
You need anything else,
grab it out of the fridge.

956
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:00,997
So I'm standing here
minding my own business,

957
00:48:01,104 --> 00:48:02,969
filling up pill bottles...

958
00:48:03,072 --> 00:48:08,977
So you're here to talk me
into shutting up?

959
00:48:10,844 --> 00:48:13,109
That what's in that case of yours?

960
00:48:13,214 --> 00:48:15,876
Yeah, basically.

961
00:48:17,085 --> 00:48:18,483
No, not basically.

962
00:48:18,585 --> 00:48:20,815
That's... that's exactly it.

963
00:48:22,923 --> 00:48:24,550
My dignity ain't for sale.

964
00:48:24,659 --> 00:48:27,126
It's not an offer.
It's a gift.

965
00:48:27,227 --> 00:48:28,353
Taxes have all been paid.

966
00:48:28,461 --> 00:48:31,192
You get to keep it
no matter what you do.

967
00:48:31,296 --> 00:48:32,730
The idea is that, somehow,

968
00:48:32,832 --> 00:48:35,460
your guilt will prevent you
from bad-mouthing us.

969
00:48:35,568 --> 00:48:37,364
Are you supposed to be

970
00:48:37,469 --> 00:48:39,163
telling me all that?

971
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:41,794
No, sir. Just apologize,

972
00:48:41,905 --> 00:48:43,668
give you the money, and leave.

973
00:48:43,774 --> 00:48:45,537
<i>Why are you telling me this?</i>

974
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,046
Because, this way,
you'll take the money.

975
00:48:50,146 --> 00:48:51,408
Why would I do that?

976
00:48:51,514 --> 00:48:52,503
Because you're mad.

977
00:48:52,615 --> 00:48:54,048
Damn straight I am.

978
00:48:54,149 --> 00:48:55,139
The first thing you'll do,

979
00:48:55,251 --> 00:48:57,344
<i>is you'll call the L.A. Times,
and CNN...</i>

980
00:48:57,453 --> 00:48:58,851
- Huh?
- And insist on Bonnie Carlton.

981
00:48:58,954 --> 00:48:59,852
She does really good

982
00:48:59,955 --> 00:49:00,853
controlled outrage.

983
00:49:00,956 --> 00:49:02,184
Tell them, "No Bonnie, no story."

984
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:03,313
Watch it on MSNBC.

985
00:49:03,424 --> 00:49:04,721
- Okay.
- When they get here,

986
00:49:04,825 --> 00:49:07,760
you open up the case...

987
00:49:10,463 --> 00:49:13,625
and you pour all the cash
out onto the floor.

988
00:49:13,733 --> 00:49:14,791
- Why?
- Trust me.

989
00:49:14,901 --> 00:49:16,095
It'll look more effective that way.

990
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:20,262
Don't forget to shake
every last bundle out.

991
00:49:22,008 --> 00:49:23,668
If you can, you know,
give a cough or two.

992
00:49:23,777 --> 00:49:26,678
Once it's all
out on the floor,

993
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,246
tell them what you're
going to do with it.

994
00:49:28,346 --> 00:49:29,314
<i>What am I going to do with it?</i>

995
00:49:29,414 --> 00:49:30,438
You're going to donate it.

996
00:49:30,547 --> 00:49:32,742
Yeah. Start the Lorne Lutch
Cancer Foundation.

997
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:34,181
You're going to have
a ranch and a fair

998
00:49:34,285 --> 00:49:36,913
and a 5K.
A 5K is a must. Television...

999
00:49:37,021 --> 00:49:38,045
Wait a minute.

1000
00:49:38,155 --> 00:49:40,384
What about my family?

1001
00:49:42,825 --> 00:49:45,020
But, Lorne, you can't keep the money.

1002
00:49:45,127 --> 00:49:46,617
Why the hell not?

1003
00:49:46,729 --> 00:49:47,958
What do you mean?

1004
00:49:48,064 --> 00:49:50,657
Denounce us,
and then keep the blood money?

1005
00:49:50,766 --> 00:49:52,062
I mean, look at it.

1006
00:49:59,341 --> 00:50:00,238
I got to think this over.

1007
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:01,204
Lorne, whoa.

1008
00:50:01,308 --> 00:50:03,298
News doesn't work that way.

1009
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:05,434
You can't denounce us next week.

1010
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:15,315
I don't suppose I can
denounce you for half of it.

1011
00:50:15,421 --> 00:50:18,786
No, Lorne. Either you keep
all the money,

1012
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:21,652
or you... you give it all away.

1013
00:50:32,102 --> 00:50:34,263
Dad, how did you know

1014
00:50:34,371 --> 00:50:36,236
he would take the money?

1015
00:50:38,574 --> 00:50:41,475
You'd have to be crazy
to turn down all that money.

1016
00:50:41,577 --> 00:50:44,044
When I saw he wasn't crazy,
I knew he'd take it.

1017
00:50:45,546 --> 00:50:48,014
Would you have taken it?

1018
00:50:48,115 --> 00:50:50,674
If I were him? Sure.

1019
00:50:53,419 --> 00:50:54,887
So would I.

1020
00:51:06,432 --> 00:51:07,490
I don't think you understand, sir.

1021
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:08,896
He's like a wild animal.

1022
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,660
You'll have to be
on your guard at all times.

1023
00:51:10,769 --> 00:51:11,756
He has this trick.

1024
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:13,063
Ron, shut up.

1025
00:51:13,169 --> 00:51:15,000
I've tangoed with presidents,
lawyers and Indian chiefs.

1026
00:51:15,104 --> 00:51:17,665
I think I can handle Mr. Nick Naylor.

1027
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:20,837
All right, welcome back, kids.

1028
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:22,843
We've got two guests
on the show tonight.

1029
00:51:22,944 --> 00:51:24,936
First, joining us
from our Washington studio...

1030
00:51:25,047 --> 00:51:26,981
I must have that tie clip!

1031
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,677
...is the senator from
the great state of Vermont.

1032
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:31,945
Please welcome Ortolan Finistirre.

1033
00:51:32,053 --> 00:51:32,951
Welcome, Senator.

1034
00:51:33,054 --> 00:51:34,612
Good to be here, Dennis.

1035
00:51:34,721 --> 00:51:36,418
And, joining us here
in our Los Angeles studio,

1036
00:51:36,524 --> 00:51:38,390
he is the chief spokesperson

1037
00:51:38,492 --> 00:51:40,686
for the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

1038
00:51:40,795 --> 00:51:42,284
Quite an august chamber, might I add?

1039
00:51:42,394 --> 00:51:44,157
- Nick Naylor. Nick, welcome.
- Pleasure to be here.

1040
00:51:44,264 --> 00:51:46,994
All right, I understand you were
on Joan Lunden's show recently.

1041
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:48,692
Didn't make a lot
of friends over there, did you?

1042
00:51:48,803 --> 00:51:50,167
I will say that I don't think

1043
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:51,566
I'll be getting
my annual invitation

1044
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:54,434
to the Finistirre Labor Day Barbecue.

1045
00:51:54,539 --> 00:51:56,941
Well, I continue to offer
an open invitation to Mr. Naylor

1046
00:51:57,042 --> 00:51:59,373
to join us in Congress
to talk about the inclusion

1047
00:51:59,476 --> 00:52:02,205
of our new poison label which,
if I might say...

1048
00:52:02,312 --> 00:52:04,473
Nick, ready to trek up
the Hill and testify

1049
00:52:04,581 --> 00:52:05,774
before Congress?

1050
00:52:05,882 --> 00:52:08,043
Well, I'd love to, Dennis,
but not as long as the senator

1051
00:52:08,152 --> 00:52:09,516
is calling for me to be fired.

1052
00:52:09,618 --> 00:52:11,916
It's not exactly
a welcome invitation.

1053
00:52:12,021 --> 00:52:14,546
Yeah. Bit of a mixed message,
Senator.

1054
00:52:14,657 --> 00:52:16,922
Well, not as mixed as the stance
that Big Tobacco has taken

1055
00:52:17,026 --> 00:52:18,789
about the dangers
of smoking cigarettes.

1056
00:52:18,895 --> 00:52:20,327
- Oh, no.
- Now what are you laughing...?

1057
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,521
You're a wind-up artist.
Give the man his due.

1058
00:52:22,631 --> 00:52:24,428
He's got a bit of a point there,
doesn't he?

1059
00:52:24,532 --> 00:52:26,397
Sorry. I just can't
help myself, Dennis.

1060
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,162
I... I... I'm just tickled by the idea

1061
00:52:28,268 --> 00:52:29,964
of the gentleman from Vermont

1062
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:32,629
calling me a hypocrite
when, uh... this same man,

1063
00:52:32,739 --> 00:52:34,603
in one day, held a press
conference where he called

1064
00:52:34,707 --> 00:52:37,198
for the American tobacco fields
to be slashed and burned,

1065
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:38,902
then he jumped on a private jet

1066
00:52:39,011 --> 00:52:41,501
and flew down to Farm Aid
where he rode a tractor onstage

1067
00:52:41,614 --> 00:52:44,605
- Oh, come on.
- As he bemoaned the downfall
of the American farmer.

1068
00:52:44,716 --> 00:52:46,513
Care to comment, Senator?

1069
00:52:46,618 --> 00:52:48,552
He... I... No.

1070
00:52:48,654 --> 00:52:50,882
Eloquent in its brevity.

1071
00:52:50,988 --> 00:52:52,114
Emotional issue.

1072
00:52:52,223 --> 00:52:53,451
Let's take some phone calls now.

1073
00:52:53,557 --> 00:52:55,854
Herndon, Virginia.
Go ahead. You're on the show.

1074
00:52:55,959 --> 00:52:58,450
Dennis, has anyone ever
announced that they're going

1075
00:52:58,561 --> 00:53:00,324
to kill someone live on your show?

1076
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:03,660
My demo's been called quirky
but, no, at this point,

1077
00:53:03,766 --> 00:53:05,859
we're not skewing
to the emotionally unstable.

1078
00:53:05,967 --> 00:53:08,095
Then it's your lucky day.

1079
00:53:08,204 --> 00:53:09,864
Because I'm here to tell
you that, within a week,

1080
00:53:09,972 --> 00:53:12,566
we're going to dispatch
Mr. Naylor from this planet

1081
00:53:12,674 --> 00:53:16,369
for all the pain and suffering
he's caused in the world.

1082
00:53:20,146 --> 00:53:22,637
As I said, emotional issue.
We're going to break now.

1083
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:24,511
I got to fire a call screener.

1084
00:53:51,441 --> 00:53:52,908
Let's go.

1085
00:54:28,574 --> 00:54:31,236
This is Nick Naylor
telling you kids,

1086
00:54:31,343 --> 00:54:34,537
"Don't do drugs, smoke cigarettes."

1087
00:54:34,644 --> 00:54:35,803
That's really great.

1088
00:54:35,912 --> 00:54:37,538
It's like I'm looking in a mirror.

1089
00:54:37,647 --> 00:54:39,774
New idea:

1090
00:54:39,883 --> 00:54:42,249
Cigarettes for the homeless.

1091
00:54:42,352 --> 00:54:43,444
We'll call them "hobos."

1092
00:54:44,987 --> 00:54:46,352
Uh, that's awful.

1093
00:54:46,455 --> 00:54:47,979
Any better than "Sector Sixes"?

1094
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:50,058
Right.

1095
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:52,992
Oh, my God, Nick, you're on TV.

1096
00:54:54,162 --> 00:54:56,790
"Lobbyist on the lookout."

1097
00:54:56,898 --> 00:55:00,094
You got to be kidding me.

1098
00:55:01,368 --> 00:55:05,064
I want to fuck you
while I watch you on TV.

1099
00:55:05,171 --> 00:55:06,899
And they call me sick.

1100
00:55:07,006 --> 00:55:07,904
Hurry.

1101
00:55:08,007 --> 00:55:09,998
Before your segment ends.

1102
00:55:10,109 --> 00:55:12,042
All right.

1103
00:55:17,816 --> 00:55:19,943
Tell me more about Los Angeles, baby.

1104
00:55:20,051 --> 00:55:21,211
Huh?

1105
00:55:25,421 --> 00:55:27,218
<i>He says he wants
to trail me everywhere,</i>

1106
00:55:27,322 --> 00:55:28,483
I said, "Who's paying for it?"

1107
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:30,080
He says the tobacco company's
paying for it.

1108
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:31,717
I said, "I don't need a bodyguard."

1109
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,386
I'm a man of the people.

1110
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,361
Rock on, Kennedy.

1111
00:55:35,464 --> 00:55:37,159
Listen, we're all going to
need bodyguards soon enough.

1112
00:55:37,266 --> 00:55:39,062
Did you see the coverage
the fetal alcohol people

1113
00:55:39,168 --> 00:55:40,224
got themselves over this weekend?

1114
00:55:40,335 --> 00:55:42,166
They made it seem like
we were encouraging

1115
00:55:42,269 --> 00:55:43,396
pregnant women to drink.

1116
00:55:43,505 --> 00:55:44,597
I'm surprised I didn't get kidnapped

1117
00:55:44,706 --> 00:55:46,036
on my way to work this morning.

1118
00:55:46,139 --> 00:55:49,630
I don't think people from
the alcoholic beverage industry

1119
00:55:49,743 --> 00:55:51,734
need to worry about
being kidnapped just yet.

1120
00:55:53,347 --> 00:55:54,938
Pardon me?

1121
00:55:55,048 --> 00:55:56,344
Look, I mean,

1122
00:55:56,447 --> 00:55:58,439
nothing personal,
but tobacco generates

1123
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:00,781
a little more heat than alcohol.

1124
00:56:00,886 --> 00:56:02,353
Oh, this is news.

1125
00:56:02,454 --> 00:56:06,082
My product puts away 475,000 a year.

1126
00:56:06,191 --> 00:56:08,853
Oh, okay, now 475 is a legit number.

1127
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,189
Okay, 435,000.

1128
00:56:10,294 --> 00:56:11,352
That's 1,200 a day.

1129
00:56:11,462 --> 00:56:12,793
How many alcohol-related deaths
a year?

1130
00:56:12,898 --> 00:56:15,022
- Well, does that...
- 100,000 tops?

1131
00:56:15,132 --> 00:56:18,761
That's, what, 270 a day?

1132
00:56:18,868 --> 00:56:20,028
Wowee.

1133
00:56:20,137 --> 00:56:22,503
270 people, a tragedy.

1134
00:56:22,604 --> 00:56:24,596
Excuse me if I don't exactly see
terrorists getting excited

1135
00:56:24,707 --> 00:56:26,332
about kidnapping anyone
from the alcohol industry.

1136
00:56:26,441 --> 00:56:27,703
- Well, you haven't even
- Okay,

1137
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:29,641
- taken into account the number of deaths
- let's just

1138
00:56:29,744 --> 00:56:32,441
- breathe.
- How many gun deaths a year in the U.S.?

1139
00:56:32,547 --> 00:56:34,276
11,000.

1140
00:56:34,382 --> 00:56:36,712
11,000, are you kidding me?

1141
00:56:36,817 --> 00:56:38,750
30 a day.

1142
00:56:38,851 --> 00:56:40,285
That's less than passenger car
mortalities.

1143
00:56:40,387 --> 00:56:41,978
No terrorist would bother
with either of you.

1144
00:56:55,667 --> 00:56:57,429
Okay, look...
stupid argument.

1145
00:56:57,535 --> 00:56:59,560
I'll say.

1146
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:02,640
I'm sure both of you warrant
vigilante justice.

1147
00:57:02,741 --> 00:57:04,502
Thank you.

1148
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:26,621
Hey... please.
Stop... hey.

1149
00:57:26,728 --> 00:57:27,820
Who are you guys?

1150
00:57:31,732 --> 00:57:34,029
<i>And freedom means
that we can do what we want.</i>

1151
00:57:34,133 --> 00:57:36,499
And that's really important.

1152
00:57:36,603 --> 00:57:40,197
Because otherwise,
we couldn't be free.

1153
00:57:40,306 --> 00:57:44,333
And that's why America is
the best government in the world.

1154
00:57:44,442 --> 00:57:46,001
Whoa, hey, hey, hey.

1155
00:57:46,112 --> 00:57:48,806
Hey, no need for that,
no need for that.

1156
00:57:48,913 --> 00:57:50,277
Whoa, whoa, hey.

1157
00:57:50,381 --> 00:57:51,347
Hey, wait.

1158
00:57:51,449 --> 00:57:52,643
Can we get a dialogue going here?

1159
00:57:52,751 --> 00:57:55,514
Nick, we want you
to stop killing people.

1160
00:57:55,619 --> 00:57:57,347
So many people.

1161
00:57:57,453 --> 00:57:59,011
Half a million people a year
in the U.S.

1162
00:57:59,122 --> 00:58:00,817
That, there's no data
to support that.

1163
00:58:00,923 --> 00:58:03,050
Nick... you're not on TV anymore.

1164
00:58:06,462 --> 00:58:08,156
Okay, Joey, it's your turn.

1165
00:58:10,765 --> 00:58:12,028
Hey!

1166
00:58:12,133 --> 00:58:13,532
Nick, how much do you smoke a day?

1167
00:58:13,635 --> 00:58:15,193
Hey, what are you doing?

1168
00:58:15,303 --> 00:58:17,566
According to the box,
each one of those patches

1169
00:58:17,671 --> 00:58:19,832
contains 21 milligrams of nicotine.

1170
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:20,906
That's, like, what?

1171
00:58:21,007 --> 00:58:22,406
One pack?

1172
00:58:22,509 --> 00:58:24,807
Our industry has been working
hand in hand with...

1173
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:26,845
Nick! Just listen, all right?

1174
00:58:26,946 --> 00:58:28,504
What makes America
the best government?

1175
00:58:28,613 --> 00:58:30,912
The passion that doesn't exist
anywhere in the world.

1176
00:58:31,016 --> 00:58:32,916
Says here there are
many adverse reactions

1177
00:58:33,018 --> 00:58:34,076
from those things.

1178
00:58:34,187 --> 00:58:36,087
Let's see, "arrhythmia,

1179
00:58:36,187 --> 00:58:37,655
"constipation, dyspepsia,

1180
00:58:37,756 --> 00:58:40,279
- "nausea...
- My industry does $48 billion in revenue.

1181
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:42,085
Pharyngitis, sinusitis..."

1182
00:58:42,193 --> 00:58:45,026
Sure you can call it capitalism,
a free market,

1183
00:58:45,129 --> 00:58:46,755
a celebration of tariff breakdowns...

1184
00:58:46,862 --> 00:58:49,524
"dysmenorrhea..."

1185
00:58:49,632 --> 00:58:51,600
I don't even want to know
what that means.

1186
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,463
Hey, look, I guess you could
start by, you know,

1187
00:58:53,569 --> 00:58:55,365
asking for five million,
working your way up from there.

1188
00:58:55,471 --> 00:58:56,903
But I don't want any money, Nick.

1189
00:58:57,005 --> 00:58:57,938
Well, what do you want?

1190
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,337
I mean, I'm all ears here.

1191
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,568
I have another word for it-

1192
00:59:02,677 --> 00:59:03,905
love.

1193
00:59:04,012 --> 00:59:05,639
What does any man want?

1194
00:59:05,747 --> 00:59:07,305
The love of a woman,

1195
00:59:07,415 --> 00:59:08,608
crisp bacon...

1196
00:59:08,715 --> 00:59:13,583
an average life span over 80 years.

1197
00:59:13,687 --> 00:59:16,052
Oh, Nick...

1198
00:59:18,225 --> 00:59:20,282
...you don't look so good.

1199
00:59:27,299 --> 00:59:29,061
<i>If you should smell smoke,</i>

1200
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:31,633
<i>please dial zero for the operator.</i>

1201
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:35,865
<i>Before leaving the room,
check the door for heat.</i>

1202
00:59:35,973 --> 00:59:38,634
<i>Find your nearest
emergency exit,</i>

1203
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:42,801
<i>then soak a washcloth
and cover your nose and mouth.</i>

1204
00:59:44,179 --> 00:59:46,375
<i>Do not remove your washcloth.</i>

1205
00:59:46,481 --> 00:59:50,247
<i>Try at all times to avoid
breathing in the smoke.</i>

1206
00:59:50,351 --> 00:59:53,616
<i>If necessary, crawl on
Your hands and knees</i>

1207
00:59:53,721 --> 00:59:56,020
<i>to avoid the inhalation of smoke.</i>

1208
00:59:56,123 --> 00:59:57,819
<i>Do not be alarmed.</i>

1209
00:59:57,926 --> 01:00:00,222
<i>There are still
no conclusive studies</i>

1210
01:00:00,327 --> 01:00:03,056
<i>that link smoking to emphysema.</i>

1211
01:00:09,602 --> 01:00:11,626
<i>You woke up.</i>

1212
01:00:11,737 --> 01:00:13,897
<i>Perhaps a bad choice of inflection.</i>

1213
01:00:14,005 --> 01:00:17,669
<i>Is she implying that I
could've just as easily not?</i>

1214
01:00:28,885 --> 01:00:30,078
I was so scared.

1215
01:00:30,185 --> 01:00:31,447
Hey, Joey.

1216
01:00:33,054 --> 01:00:34,317
What happened?

1217
01:00:34,423 --> 01:00:37,152
No nonsmoker
could've ever withstood

1218
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,251
the amount of nicotine
you had in your bloodstream.

1219
01:00:39,361 --> 01:00:41,328
Hate to say it, but...

1220
01:00:41,428 --> 01:00:43,989
cigarettes saved your life.

1221
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:47,791
Can I quote you on that, doc?

1222
01:00:47,902 --> 01:00:50,165
You're a real trooper, my boy.

1223
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:52,102
Hey, Captain,

1224
01:00:52,206 --> 01:00:53,535
where are you?

1225
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,368
Winston-Salem General.

1226
01:00:56,876 --> 01:00:59,309
Damn heart failing me again.

1227
01:00:59,412 --> 01:01:01,139
I thought we could be roommates.

1228
01:01:01,246 --> 01:01:02,473
Nick, before
we get sidetracked,

1229
01:01:02,581 --> 01:01:04,275
there is one thing.

1230
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:06,874
All right, don't get
all dramatic on me, doc.

1231
01:01:06,984 --> 01:01:09,010
You can't smoke.

1232
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:13,848
That's no problem.

1233
01:01:13,958 --> 01:01:15,482
I've quit before.

1234
01:01:15,593 --> 01:01:17,493
I did during the pregnancy.

1235
01:01:17,595 --> 01:01:18,652
How long, you think?

1236
01:01:18,762 --> 01:01:20,819
I don't think you understand.

1237
01:01:20,929 --> 01:01:23,490
It's a miracle you came
out of this alive.

1238
01:01:23,598 --> 01:01:25,191
Any smoking- one cigarette-

1239
01:01:25,301 --> 01:01:27,394
could put you right back
into a paralytic state.

1240
01:01:27,502 --> 01:01:30,097
Your body just can't handle it.

1241
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:37,401
Nick, I don't want to put
any more pressure on you,

1242
01:01:37,512 --> 01:01:39,344
but we got a camera crew
waiting out there.

1243
01:01:39,447 --> 01:01:41,470
If we want to make
the evening news...

1244
01:01:41,581 --> 01:01:44,141
You want to unhook me here?

1245
01:01:44,249 --> 01:01:48,151
This just goes to prove what
I've been saying for so long.

1246
01:01:48,254 --> 01:01:52,383
These nicotine patches
are just deadly.

1247
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:54,253
Smoking saved my life.

1248
01:01:54,359 --> 01:01:56,953
Considering your condition,
will you still be able to appear

1249
01:01:57,061 --> 01:01:59,121
before Senator Finistirre's
subcommittee hearing

1250
01:01:59,231 --> 01:02:01,253
on the usage of poison labels
on cigarette packaging?

1251
01:02:01,365 --> 01:02:02,958
Oh, I think now more than ever

1252
01:02:03,066 --> 01:02:04,898
it is imperative that I be there.

1253
01:02:05,002 --> 01:02:07,027
Nothing will keep me from testifying.

1254
01:02:07,137 --> 01:02:10,196
Fucking kidnapping.

1255
01:02:10,306 --> 01:02:11,704
I don't understand, sir.

1256
01:02:11,806 --> 01:02:15,072
Aren't we considering
the kidnapping a good thing?

1257
01:02:15,177 --> 01:02:16,838
Well, he didn't die.

1258
01:02:16,946 --> 01:02:19,277
He was almost killed, sir.

1259
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:20,541
That's the point.

1260
01:02:20,649 --> 01:02:22,742
Now he looks like a victim,
lucky bastard.

1261
01:02:24,652 --> 01:02:26,779
The way I heard it,
D.C. Police found you naked

1262
01:02:26,887 --> 01:02:28,548
laying in Lincoln's crotch

1263
01:02:28,656 --> 01:02:32,351
<i>covered in nicotine patches
with a sign across your chest</i>

1264
01:02:32,459 --> 01:02:34,950
- that said...
- He doesn't need to hear the details.

1265
01:02:35,059 --> 01:02:37,392
It was some pretty fucked up shit.

1266
01:02:37,496 --> 01:02:38,463
Shh!

1267
01:02:38,565 --> 01:02:39,553
How are you feeling?

1268
01:02:39,665 --> 01:02:42,997
I don't know.

1269
01:02:43,101 --> 01:02:45,626
First time I'm thinking these
cigarettes are pretty dangerous.

1270
01:02:45,737 --> 01:02:47,705
You might be right about that.

1271
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:49,238
What are you doing?

1272
01:02:51,009 --> 01:02:52,942
It may be small,
but it'll do the trick.

1273
01:02:53,043 --> 01:02:54,169
One shot, bam.

1274
01:02:54,277 --> 01:02:56,541
Listen, Nick is not
going to shoot anyone.

1275
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:57,772
Cool.

1276
01:02:57,881 --> 01:02:58,813
Yeah, huh?

1277
01:02:58,915 --> 01:03:00,142
I mean, uh...

1278
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:02,080
guns are to be treated with
respect, you understand that?

1279
01:03:02,183 --> 01:03:04,152
You'll make a great father.

1280
01:03:04,252 --> 01:03:05,618
Thanks.

1281
01:03:09,592 --> 01:03:11,081
Hey, there he is!

1282
01:03:11,192 --> 01:03:12,886
Hey, he's back!

1283
01:03:12,993 --> 01:03:14,426
Hey!

1284
01:03:14,528 --> 01:03:15,961
Welcome back.

1285
01:03:16,063 --> 01:03:18,156
- You okay?
- Great.

1286
01:03:18,266 --> 01:03:19,995
Good, 'cause you're booked on
all the Sunday talk shows.

1287
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:22,898
For once we got public sympathy
on our side.

1288
01:03:23,001 --> 01:03:25,663
We can start our own little
celebrity victim tour.

1289
01:03:25,772 --> 01:03:28,138
I mean, we couldn't have planned
this thing better ourselves.

1290
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,071
Oh, maybe next time
I can lose a lung.

1291
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:34,178
Oh. Uh, I heard the, uh...

1292
01:03:34,278 --> 01:03:36,474
Heather Holloway article
is coming out tomorrow.

1293
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:38,514
Really?

1294
01:03:38,617 --> 01:03:39,742
Yeah, anything I should be
worried about?

1295
01:03:39,851 --> 01:03:42,319
Uh, yeah, the Cancer Association.

1296
01:03:42,421 --> 01:03:43,784
Apparently, they have it in for us.

1297
01:03:43,887 --> 01:03:46,118
Fuckers.

1298
01:03:56,532 --> 01:03:57,499
What?

1299
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:00,261
I got a call from the paper.

1300
01:04:00,368 --> 01:04:02,529
Really?
What'd they want?

1301
01:04:02,637 --> 01:04:05,697
They wanted the correct spelling
of my name and job title.

1302
01:04:05,806 --> 01:04:07,637
You didn't tell her
about us, did you?

1303
01:04:07,742 --> 01:04:09,403
Who?

1304
01:04:09,509 --> 01:04:10,704
Heather?

1305
01:04:10,812 --> 01:04:12,677
No.

1306
01:04:14,447 --> 01:04:16,641
I mean, maybe in passing, I...

1307
01:04:16,748 --> 01:04:18,376
In passing.

1308
01:04:18,484 --> 01:04:19,711
Oh, God, he fucked her.

1309
01:04:19,818 --> 01:04:21,184
I tried to warn you.

1310
01:04:21,287 --> 01:04:23,720
Hey, he didn't fuck her.
You didn't fuck her, did you?

1311
01:04:26,156 --> 01:04:27,624
When?

1312
01:04:27,725 --> 01:04:28,656
In passing.

1313
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,885
Look, she's a really nice girl.

1314
01:04:29,994 --> 01:04:31,018
Oh, God.

1315
01:04:31,128 --> 01:04:33,119
We're really fucked.

1316
01:04:51,479 --> 01:04:54,242
<i>'Nick Naylor,

I have Heather Holloway on line one.

1338
01:06:03,575 --> 01:06:04,702
Heather.

1339
01:06:04,808 --> 01:06:06,606
Hey, Nick, what did you think?

1340
01:06:06,709 --> 01:06:08,371
Heather, uh... I...

1341
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,971
I mean, there's a lot
of information in here, Heather,

1342
01:06:11,081 --> 01:06:12,571
that is off the record.

1343
01:06:12,683 --> 01:06:14,947
You never said anything
about off the record.

1344
01:06:15,051 --> 01:06:19,488
I presumed anything said while
I was inside you was privileged.

1345
01:06:19,589 --> 01:06:21,056
Nick...

1346
01:06:21,157 --> 01:06:23,283
If you wanted to talk on a plane

1347
01:06:23,393 --> 01:06:26,758
or at a movie or over dinner,
that would have been fine.

1348
01:06:26,862 --> 01:06:28,886
But you wanted to fuck.

1349
01:06:28,996 --> 01:06:30,429
That's fine by me.

1350
01:06:30,531 --> 01:06:32,556
You used me.

1351
01:06:32,667 --> 01:06:34,294
Oh, Nick, come on.

1352
01:06:34,402 --> 01:06:36,426
Now we're being children.

1353
01:06:36,537 --> 01:06:38,596
Look, we both love our jobs.

1354
01:06:38,705 --> 01:06:41,266
I'm just a reporter,
and you're just a lobbyist.

1355
01:06:41,375 --> 01:06:43,604
How can you do this to me?

1356
01:06:45,878 --> 01:06:47,903
For the mortgage.

1357
01:06:56,321 --> 01:06:57,287
Bitch.

1358
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:58,445
Whore.

1359
01:06:58,555 --> 01:07:01,787
You should have been
more careful, Nick.

1360
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:04,690
You've destroyed all the good
will created by your kidnapping.

1361
01:07:04,795 --> 01:07:06,091
Well, we'll work up a rebuttal.

1362
01:07:06,195 --> 01:07:08,925
Heather Holloway isn't
the only reporter in town.

1363
01:07:09,031 --> 01:07:10,192
No, there isn't going
to be any rebuttal.

1364
01:07:10,299 --> 01:07:11,358
What do you mean?

1365
01:07:11,467 --> 01:07:12,798
Don't talk to anyone.

1366
01:07:12,902 --> 01:07:14,664
We're pulling you
from the congressional hearing.

1367
01:07:14,769 --> 01:07:16,326
No, no, no. You can't pull me
from the congressional hearing.

1368
01:07:16,437 --> 01:07:17,769
All you'll be doing is giving
credence to her article.

1369
01:07:17,872 --> 01:07:19,099
I'm ready to testify.

1370
01:07:19,206 --> 01:07:20,868
Look, Nick, half of my job
is damage control.

1371
01:07:20,975 --> 01:07:22,067
Today, that consists

1372
01:07:22,176 --> 01:07:24,804
of distancing ourselves
from you entirely-

1373
01:07:24,912 --> 01:07:28,642
letting you take
all the heat on this article.

1374
01:07:28,748 --> 01:07:30,477
Your job relied on your ability
to keep secrets

1375
01:07:30,583 --> 01:07:31,675
and spin the truth.

1376
01:07:31,785 --> 01:07:33,479
I just cannot imagine a way

1377
01:07:33,587 --> 01:07:35,213
in which you could have fucked
up more.

1378
01:07:35,322 --> 01:07:38,153
There's just no way I could
possibly keep you on staff.

1379
01:07:38,257 --> 01:07:40,053
Then I assume you've run this
by the captain.

1380
01:07:40,157 --> 01:07:42,092
Captain died this morning.

1381
01:08:40,009 --> 01:08:41,943
<i>Mr. Naylor,
this is Pete in Security from the Academy.</i>

1382
01:08:42,046 --> 01:08:43,910
<i>Your things are waiting for you</i>

1383
01:08:44,013 --> 01:08:45,674
<i>at the information kiosk
in the lobby.</i>

1384
01:08:45,783 --> 01:08:46,977
<i>Look, if you don't pick your
stuff up by Friday,</i>

1385
01:08:47,084 --> 01:08:49,415
<i>we're instructed to throw it out.</i>

1386
01:08:51,187 --> 01:08:54,054
<i>Mr. Naylor, this is Special
Agent Johnson with the FBI.</i>

1387
01:08:54,156 --> 01:08:56,818
<i>Having not found any leads in
Your kidnapping investigation,</i>

1388
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:58,221
<i>we're going to be
handing over the case</i>

1389
01:08:58,326 --> 01:08:59,383
<i>to the local D.C. Police,</i>

1390
01:08:59,493 --> 01:09:01,687
<i>so please refer to them

1391
01:09:01,796 --> 01:09:03,388
<i>for any updates and questions.</i>

01:09:05,333 --> 01:09:07,926
<i>Nick, Jack in Jeff Megall's office.</i>

1393
01:09:08,035 --> 01:09:11,470
<i>Jeff really enjoyed
meeting you the other day</i>

1394
01:09:11,570 --> 01:09:13,630
<i>and he's just... he's torn up
about the fact</i>

1395
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:15,503
<i>that you two couldn't find
a project to work on.</i>

1396
01:09:15,608 --> 01:09:17,735
<i>He's really just... I don't know.</i>

1397
01:09:17,844 --> 01:09:19,606
<i>So, listen,
but we should hang, at least,</i>

1398
01:09:19,711 --> 01:09:21,679
<i>so you drop me a line
whenever you're in town.</i>

1399
01:09:21,779 --> 01:09:25,237
<i>Uh... my e-mail is, uh...</i>

1400
01:09:40,830 --> 01:09:42,457
Who is it?

1401
01:09:42,565 --> 01:09:44,465
It's me, Nick.

1402
01:09:46,401 --> 01:09:48,925
Jill, this is a bad time.

1403
01:09:49,036 --> 01:09:50,628
Let me in.

1404
01:09:51,972 --> 01:09:53,735
No.

1405
01:09:53,841 --> 01:09:56,810
I brought someone
who needs to talk to you.

1406
01:10:02,014 --> 01:10:03,312
Hey, buddy.

1407
01:10:03,416 --> 01:10:05,350
Hey, Dad.

1408
01:10:05,452 --> 01:10:07,476
Coke in the fridge.

1409
01:10:13,924 --> 01:10:18,692
So, this Heather Holloway,
she must have been pretty hot.

1410
01:10:18,796 --> 01:10:21,696
Yes. She's pretty hot.

1411
01:10:21,798 --> 01:10:23,823
Don't take it so hard.

1412
01:10:23,933 --> 01:10:26,561
A few flaws can be appealing.

1413
01:10:26,669 --> 01:10:27,761
Makes you human.

1414
01:10:27,872 --> 01:10:29,303
Who wants to be human?

1415
01:10:29,405 --> 01:10:30,771
Well, I know one person

1416
01:10:30,874 --> 01:10:33,842
who still thinks you're a God.

1417
01:10:50,356 --> 01:10:53,053
Why did you tell that reporter
all your secrets?

1418
01:10:56,296 --> 01:10:58,924
You're too young to understand.

1419
01:10:59,031 --> 01:11:02,123
Mom says it's because
you have dependency issues

1420
01:11:02,232 --> 01:11:03,723
and it was all just
a matter of time

1421
01:11:03,835 --> 01:11:05,996
before you threw it all away
on some tramp.

1422
01:11:06,103 --> 01:11:09,403
Well, that's one theory.

1423
01:11:09,507 --> 01:11:11,336
Why are you hiding from everyone?

1424
01:11:11,441 --> 01:11:17,039
It has something to do with
being generally hated right now.

1425
01:11:17,146 --> 01:11:18,637
But it's your job to be
generally hated.

1426
01:11:18,748 --> 01:11:21,512
It's more complicated
than that, Joey.

1427
01:11:21,617 --> 01:11:23,880
You're just making it
more complicated

1428
01:11:23,985 --> 01:11:25,543
so that you can feel
sorry for yourself.

1429
01:11:25,654 --> 01:11:27,384
Like you always said,

1430
01:11:27,488 --> 01:11:30,786
"If you want an easy job,
go work for the Red Cross."

1431
01:11:30,891 --> 01:11:32,517
You're a lobbyist.

1432
01:11:32,626 --> 01:11:35,720
Your job is to be right, and
you're the best at what you do.

1433
01:11:37,364 --> 01:11:38,762
You're the sultan of spin.

1434
01:11:39,967 --> 01:11:41,365
"Sultan of spin"?

1435
01:11:41,468 --> 01:11:42,992
<i>Mom subscribes to Newsweek.</i>

1436
01:11:44,436 --> 01:11:45,768
Who cares what the Brads

1437
01:11:45,871 --> 01:11:46,895
of the world think?

1438
01:11:47,006 --> 01:11:48,267
He's not my dad.

1439
01:11:49,976 --> 01:11:51,442
You are.

1440
01:11:51,543 --> 01:11:54,772
<i>And right there,
looking into Joey's eyes,</i>

1441
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:58,280
<i>it all came back in a rush.</i>

1442
01:11:58,382 --> 01:12:00,849
<i>Why I do what I do-
defending the defenseless,</i>

1443
01:12:00,951 --> 01:12:03,248
<i>protecting the disenfranchised
corporations</i>

1444
01:12:03,352 --> 01:12:05,412
<i>that have been abandoned
by their very own consumers-</i>

1445
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:07,786
<i>the logger...</i>

1446
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:10,121
<i>the sweatshop foreman...</i>

1447
01:12:10,227 --> 01:12:12,251
<i>the oil driller...</i>

1448
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:14,521
<i>the land mine developer...</i>

1449
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:17,929
<i>the baby seal poacher...</i>

1450
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:19,431
Baby seal poacher?

1451
01:12:19,533 --> 01:12:20,898
Even I think that's kind of cruel.

1452
01:12:21,001 --> 01:12:23,093
All right, you're missing the point.

1453
01:12:23,203 --> 01:12:24,965
I must be, because I thought
you were apologizing.

1454
01:12:25,072 --> 01:12:26,038
I'm getting to that.

1455
01:12:26,138 --> 01:12:27,902
When?

1456
01:12:28,008 --> 01:12:30,475
Look.

1457
01:12:30,576 --> 01:12:35,411
The two of you, you're
basically my only friends,

1458
01:12:35,515 --> 01:12:37,813
and the last thing that
I would ever want to do

1459
01:12:37,917 --> 01:12:39,613
would be to hurt you.

1460
01:12:39,719 --> 01:12:41,584
And, I can only imagine...

1461
01:12:41,686 --> 01:12:42,709
Why are you smiling?

1462
01:12:42,821 --> 01:12:44,482
Why is he smiling?

1463
01:12:44,587 --> 01:12:46,680
He won a hundred bucks off of you.

1464
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:49,816
I bet Polly you'd spill the beans
to that reporter.

1465
01:12:49,927 --> 01:12:52,394
That goes against everything
that we stand for.

1466
01:12:52,495 --> 01:12:54,759
Oh, please! You've ratted us out
to some reporter with tits!

1467
01:12:54,865 --> 01:12:56,765
Glorious tits.

1468
01:12:56,866 --> 01:12:59,164
Only after you created a betting
pool testing my incompetence?

1469
01:12:59,269 --> 01:13:01,329
Do you have any idea the beating
I'm taking at Moderation?

1470
01:13:01,436 --> 01:13:04,166
Well, look, I'm sure both of
you are under a lot of scrutiny.

1471
01:13:04,274 --> 01:13:06,468
You know what?
You can stop using the plural.

1472
01:13:06,575 --> 01:13:09,771
The guys at Safety actually liked
the name "Merchants of Death."

1473
01:13:09,878 --> 01:13:11,173
They're gonna have
some bumper stickers made up.

1474
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:13,178
I'll make sure you get one.

1475
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,214
Thank you.

1476
01:13:17,385 --> 01:13:19,216
That is disgusting.

1477
01:13:20,587 --> 01:13:22,314
It's American.

1478
01:13:22,421 --> 01:13:23,979
Can I have a bite?

1479
01:13:24,089 --> 01:13:25,613
Mmm.

1480
01:13:25,724 --> 01:13:27,784
So I guess this means

1481
01:13:27,893 --> 01:13:31,124
you won't be appearing
at Finistirre's subcommittee.

1482
01:13:31,231 --> 01:13:33,458
Hmm. I was kind of looking
forward to it, too.

1483
01:13:33,565 --> 01:13:36,327
It's kind of cool in
a Jimmy Stewart sort of way.

1484
01:13:36,433 --> 01:13:38,958
More like an Ollie North sort of way.

1485
01:13:39,070 --> 01:13:41,298
Finistirre would have
torn you a new asshole

1486
01:13:41,405 --> 01:13:42,928
in a House of Parliament, no less.

1487
01:13:43,039 --> 01:13:44,336
I could have taken him.

1488
01:13:44,441 --> 01:13:46,101
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah? What would you have said?

1489
01:13:46,208 --> 01:13:47,437
I don't know.

1490
01:13:47,543 --> 01:13:50,774
I'd just like him to feel
immeasurable pain,

1491
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,346
humiliation.

1492
01:13:52,447 --> 01:13:53,915
Yeah, well, that would be
kind of tough.

1493
01:13:54,016 --> 01:13:55,380
I mean, he's already a Senator.

1494
01:13:57,319 --> 01:13:59,514
I mean, how would you get
back in even if you wanted to?

1495
01:14:03,556 --> 01:14:04,716
Uh-oh.

1496
01:14:10,664 --> 01:14:11,960
You're not gonna like this.

1497
01:14:15,067 --> 01:14:16,194
Hello.
Thanks very much for coming.

1498
01:14:16,301 --> 01:14:18,633
First of all, I'd like to say
a few words

1499
01:14:18,737 --> 01:14:19,863
to all the people who
are mentioned

1500
01:14:19,973 --> 01:14:22,031
in the recent newspaper article.

1501
01:14:22,141 --> 01:14:23,630
Please take comfort in knowing

1502
01:14:23,741 --> 01:14:27,507
that I will not rest until
your names are cleared.

1503
01:14:27,611 --> 01:14:29,704
This experience has taught me
an important lesson-

1504
01:14:29,814 --> 01:14:31,611
having sexual affairs
with members of the press

1505
01:14:31,716 --> 01:14:33,205
is just unfair.

1506
01:14:33,315 --> 01:14:35,146
It's not unfair to me, mind you,

1507
01:14:35,251 --> 01:14:38,708
but to all the people in my life
whose only crime is knowing me.

1508
01:14:38,821 --> 01:14:42,019
It was your names, not mine,
that suffered

1509
01:14:42,124 --> 01:14:44,648
from a meaningless affair
with a seductress

1510
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:48,218
in the form of a young
brunette Washington reporter

1511
01:14:48,329 --> 01:14:49,887
whose name I won't mention

1512
01:14:49,999 --> 01:14:51,931
because I have dignity.

1513
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:54,857
Mr. Naylor!

1514
01:14:54,968 --> 01:14:56,764
Are you still planning
on testifying

1515
01:14:56,870 --> 01:14:58,963
at tomorrow's subcommittee
hearing on tobacco?

1516
01:14:59,071 --> 01:15:01,336
I'm glad you asked that question.

1517
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,204
There have been wide accusations of me
dropping out of tomorrow's hearing.

1518
01:15:03,309 --> 01:15:04,537
Let it be known

1519
01:15:04,644 --> 01:15:06,373
that unless Senator Finistirre
has withdrawn my invitation

1520
01:15:06,479 --> 01:15:07,912
- to speak, it is my plan
- It's called a subpoena.

1521
01:15:08,014 --> 01:15:09,844
To be in Congress tomorrow
to share my knowledge

1522
01:15:09,948 --> 01:15:12,213
of big tobacco and all those
who enjoy its products.

1523
01:15:12,317 --> 01:15:13,578
Thank you very much.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1524
01:16:13,236 --> 01:16:15,829
Still feel like Jimmy Stewart?

1525
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:27,836
Good.

1526
01:16:35,923 --> 01:16:37,014
Why don't you all go ahead?

1527
01:16:37,122 --> 01:16:38,648
This could be a while.

1528
01:16:43,529 --> 01:16:48,556
If we could, um... if we could
take our seats, please.

1529
01:16:51,303 --> 01:16:53,863
Gentlemen, ladies.

1530
01:16:53,972 --> 01:16:56,701
If I may call this meeting to order.

1531
01:16:56,807 --> 01:17:01,573
We'll do everything we can to
keep things brief and concise

1532
01:17:01,678 --> 01:17:03,202
so that we can all
get out of here on time.

1533
01:17:03,313 --> 01:17:06,805
The skull and crossbones
means one thing:

1534
01:17:06,916 --> 01:17:08,382
Poison.

1535
01:17:08,485 --> 01:17:11,180
Thus, the message is quite clear.

1536
01:17:11,287 --> 01:17:13,448
Like any other product
that carries the branding,

1537
01:17:13,555 --> 01:17:16,785
if you take it, you will die.

1538
01:17:16,892 --> 01:17:19,951
Yes, but isn't this overkill?

1539
01:17:20,062 --> 01:17:23,325
Why don't we just use words,
as we currently do?

1540
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:27,229
Something that describes the
dangers of cigarette smoking.

1541
01:17:27,333 --> 01:17:28,357
Well, the American public
is not affected

1542
01:17:28,468 --> 01:17:29,934
by masthead anymore.

1543
01:17:30,035 --> 01:17:31,196
They need images.

1544
01:17:31,303 --> 01:17:33,669
We've done studies
which show that consumers react

1545
01:17:33,773 --> 01:17:36,332
up to 80% more to imagery
rather than words.

1546
01:17:36,441 --> 01:17:37,738
The stats are there.

1547
01:17:37,843 --> 01:17:39,639
It's just sad

1548
01:17:39,745 --> 01:17:42,076
that the Academy ofTobacco
Studies did not release

1549
01:17:42,180 --> 01:17:43,580
this type of information earlier.

1550
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:46,649
When you say
the Academy of Tobacco Studies,

1551
01:17:46,751 --> 01:17:48,082
you're referring to...

1552
01:17:48,186 --> 01:17:49,309
Yes.

1553
01:17:49,418 --> 01:17:51,148
To the coalition...

1554
01:17:51,254 --> 01:17:52,185
Yes, the coalition.

1555
01:17:52,288 --> 01:17:53,881
The big... big tobacco...

1556
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:55,252
...that is represented by...

1557
01:17:55,358 --> 01:17:56,586
By, um...

1558
01:17:56,692 --> 01:17:57,816
And specifically

1559
01:17:57,926 --> 01:17:58,824
Mr...

1560
01:17:58,927 --> 01:17:59,985
Um...

1561
01:18:00,095 --> 01:18:01,687
Mr., uh, Nick Naylor.

1562
01:18:01,797 --> 01:18:02,695
Nick Naylor?

1563
01:18:02,798 --> 01:18:03,765
Thank you very much.

1564
01:18:05,767 --> 01:18:06,664
<i>The current use</i>

1565
01:18:06,767 --> 01:18:08,394
of words instead of imagery

1566
01:18:08,502 --> 01:18:12,098
is an obvious move against
the non-English-speaking population

1567
01:18:12,206 --> 01:18:13,674
of the United States.

1568
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:15,900
The skull and crossbones

1569
01:18:16,009 --> 01:18:19,376
speak loudly in all languages.

1570
01:18:19,478 --> 01:18:22,073
By not using it,
they're saying

1571
01:18:22,182 --> 01:18:26,209
they want those who can't
read English to die.

1572
01:18:26,318 --> 01:18:28,080
Hmm. Senor Herrera,

1573
01:18:28,186 --> 01:18:31,019
could you clarify "they"?

1574
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:32,420
<i>Let it be known,</i>

1575
01:18:32,524 --> 01:18:34,991
<i>the public beating
has not gone out of style.</i>

1576
01:18:42,331 --> 01:18:44,492
Nick Naylor, please step forward.

1577
01:18:54,209 --> 01:18:56,838
You go sit with him.

1578
01:19:05,219 --> 01:19:08,210
Please state your name,
address and current occupation.

1579
01:19:08,321 --> 01:19:09,446
My name is Nick Naylor.

1580
01:19:09,554 --> 01:19:11,318
I live at 6000
Massachusetts Avenue

1581
01:19:11,423 --> 01:19:13,323
and I am currently unemployed,

1582
01:19:13,425 --> 01:19:15,553
but until recently,
I was the vice president

1583
01:19:15,662 --> 01:19:17,150
of the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

1584
01:19:17,262 --> 01:19:18,160
Mr. Naylor,

1585
01:19:18,263 --> 01:19:21,721
as vice president
of the Academy

1586
01:19:21,832 --> 01:19:23,801
ofTobacco Studies,
what was required of you?

1587
01:19:23,901 --> 01:19:25,130
What did you do?

1588
01:19:25,238 --> 01:19:28,728
I informed the public
of all the research performed

1589
01:19:28,839 --> 01:19:30,829
in the investigation
on the effects of tobacco.

1590
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:32,065
Mm-hmm,
and what,

1591
01:19:32,175 --> 01:19:34,734
so far,
has the Academy concluded

1592
01:19:34,843 --> 01:19:37,279
in their investigation
into the effects of tobacco?

1593
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:39,643
Well, many things, actually.

1594
01:19:39,748 --> 01:19:41,511
Why, just the other day
they uncovered evidence

1595
01:19:41,617 --> 01:19:43,447
that smoking can offset
Parkinson's disease.

1596
01:19:45,387 --> 01:19:46,615
I'm sure the health
community

1597
01:19:46,722 --> 01:19:47,846
is thrilled.

1598
01:19:47,954 --> 01:19:50,855
Mr. Naylor, who provides
the financial backing

1599
01:19:50,957 --> 01:19:52,926
for the Academy of Tobacco Studies?

1600
01:19:53,027 --> 01:19:56,290
Uh... Conglomerated Tobacco.

1601
01:19:56,395 --> 01:19:58,091
That's the cigarette companies.

1602
01:19:58,196 --> 01:20:00,256
For the most part, yes.

1603
01:20:00,366 --> 01:20:03,267
Do you think that...

1604
01:20:03,369 --> 01:20:05,337
might affect their priorities?

1605
01:20:05,437 --> 01:20:06,768
No, just as I'm sure

1606
01:20:06,871 --> 01:20:08,701
campaign contributions
don't affect yours.

1607
01:20:08,806 --> 01:20:09,830
Ohh.

1608
01:20:11,809 --> 01:20:15,040
Senators, Mr. Naylor is not here
to testify on the goings-on

1609
01:20:15,146 --> 01:20:16,943
of the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

1610
01:20:17,048 --> 01:20:19,105
We're here to examine
the possibility

1611
01:20:19,216 --> 01:20:20,615
of a warning logo on cigarettes.

1612
01:20:20,717 --> 01:20:21,683
Now, Mr. Naylor,

1613
01:20:21,783 --> 01:20:23,308
I have to ask you,
out of formality,

1614
01:20:23,419 --> 01:20:25,388
do you believe that smoking
cigarettes, over time,

1615
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:28,718
can lead to lung cancer and
other respiratory conditions

1616
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:30,018
such as emphysema?

1617
01:20:31,894 --> 01:20:33,383
Yes.

1618
01:20:36,231 --> 01:20:37,129
In fact, I think you'd be
hard-pressed

1619
01:20:37,233 --> 01:20:38,324
to find someone
who really believes

1620
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:40,401
that cigarettes are not
potentially harmful.

1621
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:42,731
I mean, show of hands,
who out here thinks

1622
01:20:42,836 --> 01:20:44,326
- that cigarettes aren't dangerous...
- Mr. Naylor.

1623
01:20:44,438 --> 01:20:47,566
There's no need for theatrics.

1624
01:20:47,674 --> 01:20:50,233
Sir, I just don't see the point in a warning
label for something people already know.

1625
01:20:50,342 --> 01:20:51,639
The warning symbol

1626
01:20:51,743 --> 01:20:55,372
is a reminder, a reminder of the
dangers of smoking cigarettes.

1627
01:20:55,481 --> 01:20:57,312
Well, if we want to remind
people of danger,

1628
01:20:57,416 --> 01:20:58,939
why don't we slap
a skull and crossbones

1629
01:20:59,050 --> 01:21:00,018
on all Boeing airplanes,

1630
01:21:00,118 --> 01:21:01,550
Senator Lothridge?

1631
01:21:01,653 --> 01:21:02,584
And all Fords, Senator Dupree?

1632
01:21:02,687 --> 01:21:05,019
That is ridiculous.

1633
01:21:05,122 --> 01:21:07,420
The death toll from airline
and automobile accidents

1634
01:21:07,526 --> 01:21:09,583
doesn't even skim the surface
of cigarettes.

1635
01:21:09,693 --> 01:21:10,751
They don't even compare.

1636
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:12,918
Oh, this from a senator
who calls Vermont home.

1637
01:21:13,028 --> 01:21:15,156
I don't follow you, Mr. Naylor.

1638
01:21:15,265 --> 01:21:16,926
Well, the real

1639
01:21:17,033 --> 01:21:19,592
demonstrated number one killer
in America is cholesterol,

1640
01:21:19,701 --> 01:21:20,691
and here comes
Senator Finistirre,

1641
01:21:20,803 --> 01:21:23,032
whose fine state is,
I regret to say,

1642
01:21:23,137 --> 01:21:26,163
clogging the nation's arteries
with Vermont cheddar cheese.

1643
01:21:27,809 --> 01:21:30,538
If we want to talk numbers,
how about the millions of people

1644
01:21:30,644 --> 01:21:31,611
dying of heart attacks.

1645
01:21:31,712 --> 01:21:32,975
Perhaps Vermont cheddar

1646
01:21:33,081 --> 01:21:35,446
should come
with a skull and crossbones.

1647
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:37,380
That is lud...

1648
01:21:37,483 --> 01:21:38,451
The great state of Vermont

1649
01:21:38,552 --> 01:21:40,109
will not apologize for its cheese.

1650
01:21:40,218 --> 01:21:41,186
Mr. Naylor,

1651
01:21:41,286 --> 01:21:42,776
we are here to discuss cigarettes.

1652
01:21:42,887 --> 01:21:46,516
Not planes, not cars- cigarettes.

1653
01:21:46,624 --> 01:21:49,286
Now, as we discussed earlier,
these warning labels

1654
01:21:49,394 --> 01:21:52,591
are not for those who know, but
rather for those who don't know.

1655
01:21:54,566 --> 01:21:56,557
What about the children?

1656
01:21:56,668 --> 01:21:58,692
Gentlemen...

1657
01:21:58,802 --> 01:22:00,735
it's called education.

1658
01:22:00,837 --> 01:22:02,702
It doesn't come off the side
of a cigarette carton.

1659
01:22:02,805 --> 01:22:03,863
It comes from our teachers,

1660
01:22:03,973 --> 01:22:06,032
and more importantly, our parents.

1661
01:22:06,141 --> 01:22:09,269
It is the job
of every parent

1662
01:22:09,379 --> 01:22:13,006
to warn their children of all
the dangers of the world,

1663
01:22:13,115 --> 01:22:15,675
including cigarettes, so that
one day, when they get older,

1664
01:22:15,783 --> 01:22:17,614
they can choose for themselves.

1665
01:22:19,855 --> 01:22:23,016
I look at my... son

1666
01:22:23,123 --> 01:22:24,522
who...

1667
01:22:24,625 --> 01:22:26,456
was kind enough
to come with me today,

1668
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,050
and I can't help but think

1669
01:22:29,162 --> 01:22:31,425
that I am responsible
for his growth

1670
01:22:31,529 --> 01:22:33,657
and his development.

1671
01:22:33,765 --> 01:22:35,290
And I'm proud of that.

1672
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:36,662
Well, having
said that,

1673
01:22:36,769 --> 01:22:39,329
would you condone him smoking?

1674
01:22:39,438 --> 01:22:41,769
Well, of course not.
He's not 18.

1675
01:22:41,873 --> 01:22:42,930
That would be illegal.

1676
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:46,301
<i>Yes, I-I heard you deliver
that line on 20-20,</i>

1677
01:22:46,411 --> 01:22:47,775
but enough dancing.

1678
01:22:47,878 --> 01:22:50,212
What are you going to do
when he turns 18?

1679
01:22:51,882 --> 01:22:53,439
Come on, Mr. Naylor.

1680
01:22:53,548 --> 01:22:57,109
On his 18th birthday, will
you share a cigarette with him?

1681
01:22:57,219 --> 01:22:59,449
Will you spend
a lovely afternoon,

1682
01:22:59,555 --> 01:23:01,714
like one of your ludicrous
cigarette advertisements?

1683
01:23:01,823 --> 01:23:03,347
You seem to have a lot to say

1684
01:23:03,458 --> 01:23:04,788
about how we
should raise our children.

1685
01:23:04,893 --> 01:23:05,859
What of your own?

1686
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:08,428
What are you
going to do

1687
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:10,829
when he turns 18?

1688
01:23:17,438 --> 01:23:21,099
If he really wants a cigarette,
I'll buy him his first pack.

1689
01:23:25,844 --> 01:23:28,677
Thank you for your testimony,
Mr. Naylor. You're excused.

1690
01:23:35,518 --> 01:23:36,952
I'll meet you outside, okay?

1691
01:23:49,532 --> 01:23:51,090
Great.

1692
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:52,326
Well done, my boy.

1693
01:23:52,432 --> 01:23:54,560
Were you in the same room as me?

1694
01:23:54,669 --> 01:23:55,761
The whole personal choice thing?

1695
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:56,996
They ate that shit up.

1696
01:23:57,105 --> 01:23:58,937
<i>Just checked the whip count.</i>

1697
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:00,439
That bill is going down in flames.

1698
01:24:00,541 --> 01:24:03,374
Your speech was unorthodox,
but you did it, boy.

1699
01:24:03,477 --> 01:24:04,376
You crushed the fucker.

1700
01:24:04,478 --> 01:24:05,604
That's good news for you guys.

1701
01:24:05,712 --> 01:24:07,111
Oh. Whoa, whoa.

1702
01:24:07,214 --> 01:24:10,114
We're still a team, right?

1703
01:24:10,217 --> 01:24:12,183
What about damage control?

1704
01:24:13,685 --> 01:24:15,049
Look, Nick.

1705
01:24:15,153 --> 01:24:18,748
Winston-Salem is ready
to do whatever it takes

1706
01:24:18,856 --> 01:24:20,382
to keep you onboard.

1707
01:24:28,632 --> 01:24:31,693
Nick, will you continue
fighting for cigarettes?

1708
01:24:31,802 --> 01:24:33,132
Of course he will.

1709
01:24:33,236 --> 01:24:35,204
This man here is our general.

1710
01:24:35,303 --> 01:24:37,066
We're not just gonna let him retire.

1711
01:24:37,173 --> 01:24:38,197
Is that correct, Nick?

1712
01:24:38,306 --> 01:24:39,796
You're sticking with tobacco?

1713
01:24:43,844 --> 01:24:47,336
<i>Now, I know what
you're probably thinking.</i>

1714
01:24:47,448 --> 01:24:48,609
<i>What a great opportunity for me</i>

1715
01:24:48,717 --> 01:24:50,309
<i>to teach Joey
how to use leverage against</i>

1716
01:24:50,417 --> 01:24:52,009
<i>a backstabbing boss.</i>

1717
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:55,554
<i>But I actually meant what
I said about responsibility.</i>

1718
01:24:55,655 --> 01:24:59,284
<i>Some things
are just more important</i>

1719
01:24:59,392 --> 01:25:00,552
<i>than paying a mortgage.</i>

1720
01:25:00,659 --> 01:25:03,252
<i>So I did the only responsible
thing I could.</i>

1721
01:25:03,361 --> 01:25:06,125
<i>I turned down the job.</i>

1722
01:25:06,231 --> 01:25:08,563
<i>And my timing
couldn't have been better.</i>

1723
01:25:08,666 --> 01:25:10,964
<i>Within a few months,
the cigarette companies</i>

1724
01:25:11,068 --> 01:25:12,467
<i>settled
with the American smoker</i>

1725
01:25:12,570 --> 01:25:15,231
<i>to the tune of $246 billion.</i>

1726
01:25:16,406 --> 01:25:18,738
<i>And the Academy
of Tobacco Studies</i>

1727
01:25:18,843 --> 01:25:20,606
<i>was permanently dismantled.</i>

1728
01:25:20,710 --> 01:25:23,007
<i>For the first time in decades,</i>

1729
01:25:23,113 --> 01:25:24,807
<i>BR found himself out of work.</i>

1730
01:25:26,582 --> 01:25:28,675
<i>Otherwise, not much has changed.</i>

1731
01:25:28,783 --> 01:25:30,945
<i>The MOD squad still meets every week.</i>

1732
01:25:31,053 --> 01:25:32,349
Nice.

1733
01:25:32,454 --> 01:25:34,717
<i>We even added a few new members.</i>

1734
01:25:34,821 --> 01:25:37,620
The things I could learn
from you, Bobby Jay.

1735
01:25:37,724 --> 01:25:38,713
Right.

1736
01:25:38,825 --> 01:25:40,258
Stick around. Stick around.

1737
01:25:40,361 --> 01:25:43,091
<i>Senator Finistirre is still
fighting for his causes.</i>

1738
01:25:43,198 --> 01:25:44,960
What do you say
to the people who claim

1739
01:25:45,065 --> 01:25:46,999
you are destroying cinema classics?

1740
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,727
Mmm, no. All
we're doing

1741
01:25:48,835 --> 01:25:50,495
is using
digital technology

1742
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:53,764
to tastefully update
movies of the past...

1743
01:25:53,871 --> 01:25:55,430
by removing cigarettes.

1744
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:58,771
<i>I believe that if these
stars were alive today,</i>

1745
01:25:58,876 --> 01:26:01,311
<i>they would agree that
we're doing the right thing.</i>

1746
01:26:01,412 --> 01:26:03,142
But, in essence, aren't
you changing history?

1747
01:26:03,247 --> 01:26:07,183
No, I think we're improving history.

1748
01:26:09,052 --> 01:26:10,384
<i>Even Heather is still reporting.</i>

1749
01:26:10,487 --> 01:26:11,851
The whole town has been evacuated.

1750
01:26:11,956 --> 01:26:17,255
They're calling this
the storm of the century.

1751
01:26:17,358 --> 01:26:18,690
<i>Not much changes at all.</i>

1752
01:26:18,794 --> 01:26:23,492
And this year's Foggy Bottom
Debating Society Champion is...

1753
01:26:23,599 --> 01:26:24,588
Joey Naylor.

1754
01:26:24,699 --> 01:26:25,858
- Yay!
- Yay!

1755
01:26:25,967 --> 01:26:26,864
Joey!

1756
01:26:26,968 --> 01:26:27,866
Joey!

1757
01:26:27,969 --> 01:26:28,867
Joey, Joey!

1758
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:30,493
That's my boy.

1759
01:26:30,605 --> 01:26:32,163
Hold it up. Hold it up.

1760
01:26:35,809 --> 01:26:37,834
<i>And me?</i>

1761
01:26:37,944 --> 01:26:40,640
<i>Well, there's still a place
for guys like me.</i>

1762
01:26:40,747 --> 01:26:43,374
So, be straight with me.

1763
01:26:43,482 --> 01:26:46,211
Is it true?

1764
01:26:46,317 --> 01:26:47,716
- It could be.
- Come on.

1765
01:26:47,818 --> 01:26:49,912
We know of very few cases.

1766
01:26:50,021 --> 01:26:51,147
There's no scientific proof at all.

1767
01:26:51,255 --> 01:26:52,154
There was an unfortunate
incident out in Iowa...

1768
01:26:52,256 --> 01:26:53,224
It's really a complicated situation.

1769
01:26:53,324 --> 01:26:54,518
Gentlemen,

1770
01:26:54,625 --> 01:26:57,219
practice these words
in front of the mirror.

1771
01:26:57,327 --> 01:27:00,296
"Although we are constantly
exploring the subject,

1772
01:27:00,397 --> 01:27:03,094
"currently,
there is no direct evidence

1773
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:04,598
"that links cell phone usage

1774
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:06,565
to brain cancer."

1775
01:27:13,074 --> 01:27:14,869
<i>Michael Jordan plays ball.</i>

1776
01:27:14,975 --> 01:27:16,532
<i>Charles Manson kills people.</i>

1777
01:27:16,644 --> 01:27:18,111
<i>I talk.</i>

1778
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:20,906
<i>Everyone has a talent.</i>
