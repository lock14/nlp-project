- You didn't mention
he is fat -



- he is not
he is all muscle
oh right... -



- all right
come on -



- hello
hi -



god, this is really hard
but this is my friend, Mona



and she just had to have an abortion



and what's that has to do
with me?
it was your husband's fetus



Basically, what he did
was completely to waste it...
and he took advantage of her



and now she is clinically depress
as you can see it
i mean she's just catatonic



she haven't said a word since
have you Mona?



I mean it could be....at the time
you not satisfied him enough at home
i mean...



we all know we have a certain age
we all get sad but you know...



..maybe you should keep your husband looked up
maybe you should castrate
your husband..



why won't you two just go out
and leave me and my family alone...?



It's just..you fully understand?
-get out of my face?
don't touch me!



leave my family alone!



hi there



Mona



would you be there tomorrow
won't you?



i have no absolutely any intention
to be part at your crucification



would you be there please,
for me...



can i come?
yeah



i need you there, Mona



We're going!



they go there...



Is he got a girlfriend?



As he thought of it...
he's got god
he's too busy with god



With god is like that
one long life orgasm



from you're born until you're dying
sin never goes down on him



if anything goes wrong we're slowly
bring it down again, ok?



ok,one,two,three,four..go.



fucking..how..



Ok again we deserve aplauze



if i can be saved
anybody can be saved,
anybody can be saved



the Lord Jesus started speaking to
me



he told me to build this cross



to claim this valley back,
in his name, for Him



because there's evil work in this valey



there's evil in this valley



and it manifests itself in
hundreds of ways



one person who's closer to god
today



for our actions
then that's a victory



it's a victory for everybody here



we don't pray for richies,
we pray for fullfilments in our souls
and in our hearts first before, most of all



but i have prayed for my sister,
who's there now



this is the power of prayer
cause i've prayed to Lord for
my sister



I've prayed that she'd be set free
because i know she's in turmoil



and so often
i can't reach out and tell her



but I've prayed for her Lord



I pray cause i love her



And I know that the Lord
is answering to my prayers



he answers all our prayers



...yes lord...



do you really think that
there is darkness in this valey?



oh absolutely ye
there's darkness everywhere



what about the devil?



yeah i know i was filled with Devil
at one point



what were you like?



i wasn't really a nice guy
i didn't think enough and
pour a glass in your face



pounching you in the
nose



and is it that Devil did that?



yeah, the Devil drove me
yeah



the Devil want you to do bad things
and he's got a grip of you



must be interesting to believe in something



yeah, but remember
there is Devil and there is God
and he is powerfull anywhere



I am the Devil and I have
come to kill you



I am possesed and I'll throw you..



I raise my hands on you..
you devil...as I am a child of
Jesus



..........leave your body...!!!

The Lord is the truth



...and...



everything you were saying about the Devil
-...uhmm



and all the demons



you really believed that



oh yeah



i've already met the demons



and what did you do?



I've asked Jesus Christ to
come into my life



I've asked me to free me from
guilt,sin,fear



and He came and
He washed 'em away



I can do the same for you



But He never speaks to me



But you have to pray to Him



ask Him



- To come into your heart



and He will



he is a gentle God



He is a God of love



and he knows you



he knows every hair on your head



I can't feel Him



I can't feel anything
I just feel empty



-Lord can feel you



He's in this room now



He needs to be close to you



and He want you to ask Him
to come into your heart



he wants to reach out
and touch you



He want you to feel Him



He wants to come inside you



and overwhelm you with joy



I want him to



do not resist him



It's too easy
you're fucking fraude



Tam, Tam



Help me



Mona..
