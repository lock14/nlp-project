<i>To act is to live.</i>

00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,277
<i>Are you tired?
Overweight?</i>

3
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:38,963
<i>Lacking energy?</i>

4
00:00:39,088 --> 00:00:41,649
<i>Do you wish you could
look and feel young again? You can!</i>

5
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:44,085
<i>By unlocking the power
of natural juice</i>

6
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,256
<i>with Jack La Lanne's Power Juicer.</i>

7
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,957
<i>We juiced with this other juicer,</i>

8
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,625
<i>and look how much work it takes,</i>

00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,027
<i>feeding the small chute.</i>

10
00:00:53,152 --> 00:00:56,054
<i>To act is to
breathe the poet's breath.</i>

11
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,789
<i>It is to embody
the dreams of man.</i>

12
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:25,382
<i>To live as an actor
is to live a dream.</i>

13
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:30,855
I'm having a herpes
outbreak right now.

14
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,234
But you'd never know it.

15
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,805
Thanks, Herpecol.

16
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,332
<i>But dreams are ephemeral,
and sometimes impossible.</i>

17
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:45,837
<i>So we must ask,</i>

18
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:49,373
<i>where do dreams go to die?</i>

19
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:05,167
Hey, look, I'm sorry, okay?

20
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:09,461
Hey, well, why don't I take you out to
dinner to apologize for my rudeness?

21
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,098
Give me your number.

22
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,811
You want my number?

23
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,679
Which number do you want, George?

24
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,038
You see, right there.
I like the way you say "George."

25
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:27,322
For instance, ten. That's how
many months old my baby girl is.

26
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:28,789
You got a baby girl?

27
00:02:28,914 --> 00:02:29,991
Sexy?

28
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,693
How about six?

29
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,295
That's how old my other daughter is.

30
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,364
Eight is the age of my son.

31
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,366
Two is how many times
I've been married and divorced.

32
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,402
Sixteen is the number of
dollars in my bank account.

33
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:43,771
And I'm guessing zero is the number

34
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:45,896
of times you're gonna call me.

35
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:03,025
Hey, the reviews are in.

36
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,849
Read them quickly.
It minimizes the pain.

51
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:45,966
What's "fisted"?

52
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:47,025
What?

53
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:50,237
I have so much anger.

54
00:03:50,362 --> 00:03:51,930
I feel like I've been raped.

55
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,031
In the face!

56
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:01,483
What do I need to do to please you?

57
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,217
Is that the purpose of your plays?

58
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:04,953
To please me?

59
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,921
I put a lot of myself into my work.

60
00:04:08,046 --> 00:04:10,891
Would it kill you to say something
nice about it once in a while?

61
00:04:11,016 --> 00:04:12,860
Have you ever considered doing a play

62
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:14,919
that wasn't originally
a popular movie?

63
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,766
No. Why?

64
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:22,269
Do you think I should be
writing more of my own material?

65
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:28,110
That wasn't what I had in mind,
but, sure, why not?

66
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:30,177
You know, there's so much
I want to say through my own work

67
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:33,915
that sometimes it overwhelms me.

68
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,451
I gotta go clean the hamster cages.

69
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,185
Are you going to be all right?

70
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,154
Yes, I'm great.

71
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,423
Okay.

72
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:42,947
Yeah, you take care.

73
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,353
Thanks for the truth sandwich,
my little brother.

74
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,238
Morning, Gary.

75
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,439
Morning, Dana.

76
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,841
Top of the morning to you.

77
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:04,012
It's a really kickass sunny
day outside today, man.

78
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,346
Great observation there, Gary.

79
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,204
We live in Tucson.

80
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,218
Can I talk to you, please, privately?

81
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,052
Sure, squishy.

82
00:05:12,177 --> 00:05:13,321
Excuse us.

83
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,956
Yeah.

84
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,447
Sorry, I'm a little
groggy. I was up late.

85
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,295
I'm working on an original play.

86
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,163
It's about my childhood.

87
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:25,901
Anyway, I know we're broke
and that we needed a roommate,

88
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:28,370
but I swear to God,
I can't live like this anymore.

89
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,038
I'm gonna go back to
dealing pot, I swear...

90
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,340
No, no, I will not
have you pushing drugs.

91
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,944
I was a dealer, not a pusher.

92
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,512
It's just until I,
you know, get an agent

93
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:40,048
and start doing commercials again.

94
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,218
Also known as never.

95
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,886
You keep me honest,
I adore you for that.

96
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,221
Well...

97
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,156
It's not so bad.
I mean, Gary has a car.

98
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,024
That's helped out a lot around here.

99
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,492
Gary has a car.

100
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,384
Maybe I can get him
to run me over with it.

101
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,430
You.

102
00:05:56,555 --> 00:05:59,057
What did I do so right
to get you in my life?

103
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:10,000
Hey, Max.
Hey.

104
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:29,553
Okay, I...
Okay, I get it.

105
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:34,002
Hey, gang, what's up?

106
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,338
Mr. Marschz,
have you seen our new class yet?

107
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:38,038
No. Why?

108
00:06:38,163 --> 00:06:40,574
Let's just say,
it's new and different.

109
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:45,235
Well, Rand, "new" and "different"
are two of my favorite words.

110
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,533
In my prayer circle,
I've been praying

111
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,067
for more racial understanding,

112
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:09,761
but I still get anxious
around ethnics.

113
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,805
Okay, please
turn down the music.

114
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,143
Not off, just down.

115
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,213
Okay, we've got
ourselves a full house!

116
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,159
Scary!

117
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:34,461
Normally, I only have
the two students.

118
00:07:34,586 --> 00:07:38,389
Let's go around and find out why
drama is suddenly so popular.

119
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,557
You?

120
00:07:41,593 --> 00:07:43,271
Yolanda doesn't talk.

121
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,139
But you know the only reason
that we're here, right,

122
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,641
is because there's asbestos
in the portable classrooms,

123
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:49,343
and because we live
on the poor side of town

124
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:51,312
and there isn't any money,

125
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,281
they just decided to cancel
everything that we care about.

126
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,483
You know, like computers and ceramics

127
00:07:56,608 --> 00:08:00,088
and shop and arts and crafts,
and drama was the only elective left.

128
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,146
Did anyone pick drama
as a first choice?

129
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:07,718
That's fine.

130
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:12,490
Better never than late.

131
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:17,137
Okay, as a point of departure,
has anyone seen the movie

132
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:19,341
<i>Dead Poets Society,</i> starring...
What's your name?

133
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,264
...the always-superb
Robin Williams? I'm Octavio.

134
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:25,480
Well, it's very good.
I was, for one week,

135
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,382
Mr. Williams' stand-in on
the fantastic motion picture

136
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:29,617
<i>Patch Adams,</i>

137
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:31,386
when I lived in Hollywood.
Hey, come on.

138
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,586
Hey, I'm just trying to be friendly.

139
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:36,157
He once gave me
a ride to my bus stop.

140
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,225
I couldn't be happier
for all his success.

141
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,219
Nice
guys do finish first.

142
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,655
So what's...
Hey, what's your name?

143
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,235
Heywood.

144
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,570
Heywood...

145
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,572
Heywood Jablomey.

146
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:51,796
Right.

147
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:57,144
Perhaps some of you have seen

148
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:58,769
the movie <i>Mr. Holland's Opus?</i>

149
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,548
Starring, I know...

150
00:09:01,673 --> 00:09:05,486
Starring Richard Dreyfuss
as a music teacher with a deaf son.

151
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,554
He can't hear his music.
Imagine that?

152
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:10,024
Very sad.

153
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,259
Also stars Glenne Headley.

154
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:14,095
Wildly underrated.

155
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,331
Check these out.
They're all

156
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:17,798
inspirational...

157
00:09:17,923 --> 00:09:19,067
Teacher.

158
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,491
... teacher movies.

159
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,294
What could I do

160
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:26,596
to inspire...

161
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,212
Hey, you fucking bastards!

162
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,778
Just kidding. Hope
I'm not freaking you out.

163
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,283
Wait, I hope I am freaking you out!

164
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,495
Is this guy for real?

165
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,130
Okay, let's start with an exercise.

166
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:51,698
Rand, get up here.

167
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:54,369
Okay, Rand.
Be an animal.

168
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:57,495
Hey, check this out.

169
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:08,706
Yeah, this is one of the most basic
skills a drama student can acquire.

170
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,309
That's beautiful, Rand.

171
00:10:14,846 --> 00:10:16,313
Feline good.

172
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,427
Anyone tell what
kind of animal Rand is?

173
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:22,320
He's a pussy.

174
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:25,288
Okay.

175
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,436
Okay. So, Heywood.

176
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,571
What?

177
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:30,961
What kind of creature would you be?

178
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,709
I could be a flaming ass crack.

179
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,366
Wait, you're already doing that.

180
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,371
You know, I'd like
to see your Bottom.

181
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,740
Like to see my what?

182
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:47,311
I'd like to see your Bottom.

183
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,658
I mean, your portrayal of Bottom

184
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,161
in <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream.
A Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>

185
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:55,230
It's written by a buddy of mine,
you may have heard of him,

186
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,331
William Shakespeare.

187
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,700
Yeah, he liked to goof around,

188
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,902
but most of the time he was serious.

189
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:04,139
Because he, like I,
believed that theater has the power,

190
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,374
not only to transform the actor,

191
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,809
but also the audience.

192
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,245
Do you believe that?

193
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,746
Sounds kind of cuckoo-bananas.

194
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:14,149
But I believe that.

195
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,717
I believe that with
every fiber of my being.

196
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,509
If I kick this trash can...

197
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:23,346
My God! Yolanda!

198
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,192
My God!

199
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:28,495
Okay, she's still conscious
and she's not bleeding.

200
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,630
Man, you need to be careful.

201
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,115
You know what I'm saying?

202
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,601
Hey, I've learned a lesson here,
but I hope you all have, too.

203
00:11:34,726 --> 00:11:38,239
About the vitality
of shared experience.

204
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,408
We will all remember this moment
for the rest of our lives.

205
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:42,777
It was dramatic.
It was visual.

206
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,511
It was stupid.

207
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:47,071
It was stupid,
but it was also theater.

208
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,418
Okay, I'd like to borrow your cell.
Call 911.

209
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:52,677
Yolanda?

210
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,590
Yolanda?

211
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,514
It's free.
Wake up.

212
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,208
Hey.

213
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,475
We started without you.

214
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,312
Apologies.

215
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,614
I had to spend some
time with the lawyers

216
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,582
for the school district
and paramedics.

217
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:22,917
Now, it's all going to work out.

218
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:23,817
There's no brain damage.

219
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:26,509
No charges will be pressed.

220
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,426
I think I need a quesadilla.
Immediamente!

221
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:34,528
Nothing you are saying
makes any sense to me.

222
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:38,466
Turns out my class is fourteen
times as crowded as it normally is.

223
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,534
I've got a real tough nut to crack.

224
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,394
A Mexican boy, lives by his wits.

225
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,974
I'm going to inspire this year.

226
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,442
I mean, make a real difference.

227
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:52,279
I feel, for the first time,
I can make a genuine difference.

228
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,504
God! I am getting hammered!

229
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,910
Careful, Brie.
You know how you get.

230
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,881
No, Dana.
How do I get?

231
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:08,451
Please, tell me how I get.

232
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,778
No, I see. I got you.
I totally got you.

233
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,802
Okay, she got me.

234
00:13:31,943 --> 00:13:34,022
You guys laugh so much.

235
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,080
Another gem of an insight from Gary.

236
00:13:36,915 --> 00:13:40,850
Our boarder, Gary.

237
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:47,467
Hey, don't forget.
We have an A-P-P-O-I-N-T-M-E-N-T

238
00:13:47,592 --> 00:13:50,094
at the sperm doctor on Wednesday.

239
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,075
I don't like airing
our personal business

240
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,976
in front of you-know-who, Gary,

241
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,544
but if you're shooting blanks,
I swear to God,

242
00:13:57,669 --> 00:14:00,504
I'm going to stab you
to death in your sleep.

243
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,619
But, seriously,
you gotta let your balls breathe, okay?

244
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:07,087
It's in that pamphlet I read.

245
00:14:07,212 --> 00:14:10,625
It's... And the corduroy has got to go,
especially with the skating.

246
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,216
It's like...

247
00:14:13,785 --> 00:14:15,429
We live in Tucson, for fuck's sake.

248
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:16,998
You're broiling our little tadpoles

249
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,155
in that crotch of yours. What?

250
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,528
Can I get a virgin
strawberry, please?

251
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:26,864
Seven years sober.

252
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,077
Awesome.

253
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,715
I seriously, seriously wish
you would start drinking again.

254
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,415
Brie, I would never judge you.

255
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,618
Good, because if I had
to give up booze,

256
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:41,355
I'd blow my brains out living
in this shit-sack city.

257
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,746
Anyway, to Dana.

258
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:49,463
My husband.
What the fuck was I thinking?

259
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,120
I'm just kidding.

260
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,890
I don't have a drink.

261
00:14:57,996 --> 00:15:00,006
Did you do something
different with your hair today?

262
00:15:00,131 --> 00:15:04,412
Look, I have a life plan,
and it does not include you.

263
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:07,815
Well, if you don't
spend no time with me,

264
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,149
how are you supposed to
get to know me, sunshine?

265
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:10,418
That's the whole point.

266
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:11,586
I don't want to spend time with you.

267
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:12,854
So pretty!

268
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:14,711
It's from Ethiopia.

269
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:20,717
I re-watched a fantastic
movie last night,

270
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:24,065
<i>Dangerous Minds,</i>

271
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,134
starring the gorgeous
Michelle Pfeiffer.

272
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,827
It gave me a little insight into
your character, Mr. Tough Guy.

273
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:34,674
Okay, stand up.

274
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:35,732
Why?

275
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,735
We're going to karate.

276
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:40,738
No, man.
I don't think so.

277
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:43,072
Come on.

278
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,950
Nice freeball.

279
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,630
Now, punch me.

280
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,032
I'm not punching a guy in a dress.

281
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,801
It's a kaftan, my friend.

282
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:02,860
Keeps my balls at room temp.
Now, do it.

283
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:05,807
Don't make me do this.

284
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:06,841
Do it.

285
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,942
Do it!

286
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,668
You all right?

287
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:13,947
Mr. M?
My God!

288
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:16,817
I can't believe
this is happening to me.

289
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,676
Mr. M, are you okay?

290
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,811
Breathe!

291
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:24,192
I wasn't ready.

292
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,126
Mr. Marx, could I have a minute?

293
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,152
Sure! Sure, sure.

294
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:38,239
What's the matter with you?

295
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,107
Trying to inspire a troubled student.

296
00:16:41,232 --> 00:16:44,245
Look, I thought you should
know as soon as possible.

297
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,081
Last night, the school board,
which is facing major financial cuts,

298
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:49,706
decided to cancel drama.

299
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:51,375
Cancel how?

300
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,889
Completely. Forever.

301
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,182
You can stay till the end of
the term and after that, get out.

302
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:02,496
You can't have a school
without a drama department.

303
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,020
Sure, you can.

304
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:08,736
This is obviously a practical joke.

305
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,705
Look, the county and the school
district are in fiscal crisis.

306
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,141
All the arts programs are
on the chopping block.

307
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:18,335
And let's face it, we're not
producing any Oscar-winners here.

308
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,615
Tony.

309
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,717
What?

310
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,251
That would be Tony-winners.

311
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,186
It's the award for theater.

312
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,288
Listen up, guy.
I've seen your plays.

313
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:30,247
This is no great loss.

314
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,036
Well, you're a dirty, violent beaner!

315
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,703
You shouldn't have hit him like that!

316
00:17:43,828 --> 00:17:44,672
Shut up, you cow.
It wasn't my fault.

317
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:45,772
He made me hit him.

318
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:46,941
That, to you...

319
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,075
You are racist, okay?

320
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,309
And a terrible person!
Really?

321
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,281
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!

322
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,074
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!

323
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:02,145
Mr. Marschz?
Are you okay?

324
00:18:04,182 --> 00:18:07,351
No, Rand!
I'm not okay!

325
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,727
Can you tell me how

326
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:20,942
a little boy

327
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,943
from a dairy farm in Manitoba,

328
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:26,869
who dreams of acting
but can't do it very well,

329
00:18:27,972 --> 00:18:31,618
and could never get a decent agent,

330
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:35,088
so he moves on, decides to teach,

331
00:18:35,213 --> 00:18:37,381
to pass on his love of the craft...

332
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:42,819
Can you tell me how
he deals with all the

333
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:48,603
God-awful crap that's
handed out to him without

334
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,270
wrapping his lips around a .45

335
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,863
and just blowing his brains out?

336
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,098
Don't do it!

337
00:18:59,503 --> 00:18:59,980
Is he acting?

338
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,214
No, he's not that good.

339
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:03,307
Mr. Marschz!

340
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:09,022
<i>Dana Marschz's
wavering consciousness</i>

341
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:11,325
<i>led him to believe that
he was leaving this Earth</i>

342
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,828
<i>and all its trials.</i>

343
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:17,765
<i>But the fates had long ago deigned</i>

344
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,923
<i>that his life's work
was only just begun.</i>

345
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,278
Where the fark have you been?

346
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:34,171
Staring into
the abyss of nothingness.

347
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:38,842
Drama has been cancelled.

348
00:19:41,212 --> 00:19:43,790
Finally! Now you can go
back to your job at Rite Aid

349
00:19:43,915 --> 00:19:46,192
and start making some real money.

350
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:49,763
Dana, I found a great
parking spot right out front

351
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,231
and there was still
time on the meter.

352
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,037
They should just ship
you on over to the Gulf,

353
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:57,304
you know, let you talk to people.

354
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:00,240
All the terrorists would
just kill themselves.

355
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:04,711
Well, I, for one, am very appreciative
that Gary drove you here.

356
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,248
Why did you bring that thing?

357
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:11,208
I don't know. I thought maybe
I could work through my grief in song.

358
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:21,194
Maybe it's better that I just...

359
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,962
I can't get pregnant.

360
00:20:23,087 --> 00:20:25,298
I think we shouldn't
pass on this gene pool.

361
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:27,801
This is for you, baby.

362
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,336
<i>Am I shooting blanks?</i>

363
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:33,864
<i>Are my testicles an empty tank?</i>

364
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:40,069
<i>Is it all a ruse when I go kergluge?</i>

365
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,873
<i>Why?</i>

366
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:47,087
<i>I want to</i>

367
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:51,315
<i>Splash you with
my hot-buttered love spackle</i>

368
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:56,953
<i>So put your lips around
this wedding tackle</i>

369
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,356
<i>It's nuclear war!</i>

370
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,863
Meyerschz? Yeah,
I need a copy of your insurance card.

371
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,098
Can you get the... Thanks.

372
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:13,446
I'm sorry about my husband.

373
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:15,048
He's not right in the head.

374
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:16,750
- It's okay.
- It's Marschz, by the way.

375
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:17,884
Marschz?
Yeah.

376
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:19,053
Marschz.

377
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:20,386
Marschz?

378
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:21,922
Marschz.

379
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,057
Marschz?

380
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:24,090
Marschz.

381
00:21:24,215 --> 00:21:25,259
Marschz.

382
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,616
I don't care.

383
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,530
Excuse me,
I'm sorry to be so forward,

384
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:34,934
but you look a lot like my favorite
actress of all time, Elisabeth Shue.

385
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:36,971
Yeah. I am her.

386
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:39,061
But you really look like her.

387
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:42,343
Well, that's because I am her.

388
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:46,079
My God!
I knew it in my heart-soul.

389
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:49,383
My God!
I'm freaking out!

390
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:51,300
I'm freaking out.

391
00:21:51,425 --> 00:21:53,220
You, you were wonderful
in <i>Leaving Las Vegas...</i>

392
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,055
Thank you.

393
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,891
... and so fabulously funny in
<i>Adventures in Babysitting,</i>

394
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:59,393
not forgetting <i>Cocktail</i>
with Tom Cruise.

395
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,228
What is he like?
He seems totally great.

396
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:02,797
What are you doing in Tucson?

397
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,964
My God!
I'm freaking out!

398
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:07,934
I'm actually a nurse now.

399
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:11,271
I just, you know, got kind of
sick of the business, you know?

400
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:13,374
Sick of all the horrible people,

401
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,442
and it's all about being
a fucking celebrity now.

402
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,412
Anyway, there's a real
shortage of nurses out there,

403
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:22,249
and I like taking care of people.

404
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,851
My God!
I didn't hear anything you just said

405
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:25,419
because I'm too excited.

406
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:28,189
Would you come and speak
with my drama class?

407
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,356
They would just lose their minds.

408
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:33,294
No. They wouldn't even
know who I am, anyway.

409
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:34,351
They would.

410
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,031
All right. I'll come.

411
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:41,490
But, I'm gonna talk about all
the insecurity and the self-loathing,

412
00:22:42,193 --> 00:22:43,237
the rejection...

413
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,538
Perfect!

414
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,039
So, what's Nick Cage really like?

415
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:49,132
I mean, were you
just paralyzed with awe?

416
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,846
I have to go back to work.

417
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,279
Elisabeth Shue.

418
00:22:53,404 --> 00:22:57,884
I feel so connected
to you. Yes, I do.

419
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,320
And I thank you for
giving me back my smile.

420
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,078
You're welcome.

421
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,058
Shoo! Shoo, Shue!

422
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:06,349
God!

423
00:23:07,685 --> 00:23:11,087
Doctor! My God!

424
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,507
Okay, gang.

425
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,732
This is the amount
we need to save drama.

426
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:30,707
6K, a.k.a. $6,000.
How do we get it?

427
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,988
Piff?
Bake sale.

428
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:38,525
Not enough dough, pun intended.

429
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,018
Yo. We could knock over a 7-Eleven.

430
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:43,364
Nice thought,

431
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,665
but 7-Elevens are not
as vulnerable as they used to be.

432
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,334
Don't ask me how I know that.

433
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,393
I saw it on the Discovery Channel.

434
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,038
I've got a little
something-something.

435
00:23:52,163 --> 00:23:53,789
Let's hear it.

436
00:23:53,914 --> 00:23:55,541
Toasters. Man, you know,
we just move that skeet.

437
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:57,912
You know, 10 grands.

438
00:23:58,037 --> 00:24:00,381
Hell, we could do that.

439
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:01,738
Hey, dumbass!

440
00:24:03,174 --> 00:24:05,251
"Toaster" is street for "gun."

441
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,121
"Toaster" is street for "gun"?

442
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:09,923
What a colorful expression!

443
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:12,315
There he goes!
The little kangaroo rat!

444
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:16,596
Hey, Noah Sapperstein.

445
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:18,231
Hi!

446
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,034
Happy?

447
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,170
Happy you finally succeeded
in taking me down?

448
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,471
No. I think it's
terrible what's happened

449
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:27,708
to arts education in this country.

450
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,209
I don't know what to do.

451
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:31,211
Everything is out of control.

452
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:34,515
You want to save drama, but you've
produced nothing worth saving.

453
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,950
You know, it's like...

454
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:38,318
It's like my father got reincarnated

455
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,621
into the body of a freaking
little drama critic.

456
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:43,356
Look, all I'm saying is,

457
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:46,115
you need to inspire everyone
to come to your rescue.

458
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,997
You know, I was thinking of working

459
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:52,615
on a musical version
of <i>The Lake House,</i>

460
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,234
you know the wonderful Sandra Bullock,
Keanu Reeves...

461
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:57,403
Play with space and time.

462
00:24:57,528 --> 00:24:59,328
No?
No.

463
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:01,741
There is one other thing.

464
00:25:01,866 --> 00:25:03,576
It's a piece I've been working on.

465
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:08,315
I have the first act and reams
of notes in my inspiration box.

466
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,318
It's called <i>Hamlet 2.</i>

467
00:25:12,443 --> 00:25:15,055
A sequel to <i>Hamlet</i> by Shakespeare?

468
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,491
Yes. Yes. Do you think
it's a bad idea?

469
00:25:18,616 --> 00:25:21,295
Not necessarily, no.

470
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,698
Sometimes an idea could be so bad,
it starts to turn good again.

471
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:29,202
But... And so, what about
funding for drama next trimester?

472
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:30,671
Forget about the money right now.

473
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:33,773
Put on a play, and make it
the best you've ever done.

474
00:25:33,898 --> 00:25:37,601
Use that as a way of drawing
attention to the funding issue.

475
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:41,214
What if it sucks?

476
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,750
Isn't that a question
every artist must ask himself?

477
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:49,088
Yes! I am
an artist, aren't I?

478
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:52,291
Thank you. You've given me
the kick in the pants I needed, kid.

479
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:54,228
Okay, well, I need
to go to recess now.

480
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:56,353
You're very busy.
I understand.

481
00:26:13,704 --> 00:26:17,339
My God!
Writing is so hard.

482
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:36,660
What is your fucking problem, man?

483
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:54,515
Dana? Dana?
Hey, I need some money.

484
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,782
Hey, it's done.

485
00:27:56,907 --> 00:27:59,452
What is? My original work
that's gonna save drama.

486
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:03,222
The thing I've been working on
for the last 47 billion hours.

487
00:28:03,347 --> 00:28:04,590
Is that what you were doing?

488
00:28:04,715 --> 00:28:06,660
I thought you were just
having a nervous meltdown.

489
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:09,296
You're not
far off, ladypants.

490
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,280
Any creative person will tell you,

491
00:28:11,405 --> 00:28:13,390
you gotta go a little crazy
to make great fucking art.

492
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:19,573
<i>Hamlet 2?</i>

493
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,575
The deuce. Correct.

494
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,711
Doesn't everybody die
at the end of the first one?

495
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,413
I have a device.

496
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,647
"The time machine door opens..."

497
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:29,348
That's the device.

498
00:28:29,473 --> 00:28:33,220
"... revealing Hamlet,
Gertrude, Polonius,

499
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:36,656
"and Hillary Clinton having
what appears to be group sex."

500
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:39,749
It's about my troubled
relationship with my father.

501
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,230
But you're doing this at
school with the kids, right?

502
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:47,768
That's the plan, Stan.
What do you think?

503
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:52,873
I think
that your enthusiasm is remarkable.

504
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:55,531
I will take that!
I will take it!

505
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,213
Hey, Dana.

506
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:01,503
Hello, Gary.

507
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:04,617
Hey! Guess what I've got!

508
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:05,519
Your head out of your ass?

509
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:06,843
No!

510
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,413
Right. Watch out!
This stuff is sharp.

511
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:16,786
As in cutting edge.
All righty!

512
00:29:19,857 --> 00:29:21,458
Are you okay?

513
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,505
Yes!

514
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,407
You're telling me that this
guy traveled through time

515
00:29:28,532 --> 00:29:31,433
from Denmark 400 years ago?

516
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:35,315
And you call me a drunk?

517
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,474
It's true, Papa.
I done saw it.

518
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:40,643
Come here, boy.

519
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:50,787
Take it easy on him,
Ray. He's sensitive.

520
00:29:53,924 --> 00:29:55,458
Come closer.

521
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:02,999
Lay a hand on him,
and I will make you regret it.

522
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:09,548
You trying to take me on,
you time-travel freak?

523
00:30:09,673 --> 00:30:12,486
Getting drunk and beating
up on a little boy?

524
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:15,489
That doesn't make you
a man, you piece of shit!

525
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:16,690
I got the mind to put
you through that wall.

526
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:17,891
Then fucking do it, bitch!

527
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,893
Yeah?
Do it, motherfucker, come on.

528
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:21,728
What? Bring it!

529
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,763
Excuse me! Excuse me,
but they're off-book,

530
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,666
and he's definitely not
using Shakespearean language,

531
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:28,501
and the violence is getting
a little too real for me,

532
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:29,903
thank you very much.

533
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:32,127
Okay, let's stop there.

534
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,844
Heywood, that was very powerful.

535
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,469
Yeah, that was.

536
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:43,605
It was gangster.

537
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,710
Wow. Where were you when I was seven?

538
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,557
Class, thoughts?

539
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,959
I thought Octavio was amazing.

540
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,827
I felt this electric charge!

541
00:30:54,952 --> 00:30:57,886
He's so much more powerful
than any other actor I've...

542
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,037
It's stupid to compare.

543
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:07,630
I'm just so surprised that
one of you people can act.

544
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:11,077
"One of you people"?
What does that mean?

545
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,979
Man, that's some
racist shit right there.

546
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:14,815
I heard that, man.

547
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,817
If you don't like
this class, get out.

548
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:18,085
Or what, bitch?

549
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,386
Don't you call me a bitch!
Hey, simmer down.

550
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:22,055
I'm so sick and tired of you,
Epiphany.

551
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,680
You're hurting me!

552
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:27,993
Don't do that to my friend!

553
00:31:28,118 --> 00:31:29,563
That's it, that's it.

554
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:31,964
Let me give you a piece of my mind.

555
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:34,034
No, I'm really different.

556
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,594
You've got to do something, Dana.

557
00:31:38,262 --> 00:31:39,905
Time out! Time out!

558
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,730
You've got to do something, Dana.

559
00:31:44,134 --> 00:31:46,145
You want nachos or pizza?

560
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,936
Nacho!

561
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,519
I have access to the activities van.

562
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,921
We can go to the
Fun Zone in the mall.

563
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:56,945
I'll get everyone a snack.

564
00:31:58,048 --> 00:31:59,949
You want nachos or pizza?

565
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,430
I could go for some nachos.

566
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:04,998
Figures.

567
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:08,434
I'm not doing carbs, but maybe
they have a salad or something.

568
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,569
Anything is better than this.

569
00:32:10,694 --> 00:32:12,772
All right, we're back on track!

570
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,763
And we cannot be stopped!

571
00:32:15,032 --> 00:32:16,098
Yeah.

572
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:27,487
I just don't even care.

573
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,144
Hey, Mr. Marschz.

574
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,090
Hey, are you mad at me?

575
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:32,792
No, no.

576
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:33,926
I don't know.

577
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:35,796
You've barely spoken to me all day.

578
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:37,864
Is it because of my resistance
to these gang-bangers?

579
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,500
Hey, hey, just because
they're Latinos

580
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,536
doesn't make them
gang-bangers. Got it?

581
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:46,138
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I just love class so much.

582
00:32:46,263 --> 00:32:48,909
I just don't want anything to change.

583
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:50,576
Rand, you're teacher's pet.

584
00:32:50,701 --> 00:32:52,679
What more do you want?

585
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,305
Come on, let's go hang with the gang.

586
00:32:56,173 --> 00:32:57,683
You mean Latinos.

587
00:32:57,808 --> 00:33:01,577
Hey, you little thing.
Come on.

588
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,490
Hey, guys, I'm Groucho Marx.

589
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,115
I say funny stuff.

590
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:11,287
Mr. Marschz, these guys are drunk.

591
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:14,968
Come on, guys.
I said no drinking.

592
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:16,603
Why don't you have one with us, <i>ese?</i>

593
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:19,228
Maybe you'd stop
being such a <i>pinche joto.</i>

594
00:33:21,031 --> 00:33:24,243
The truth is, Heywood,
I haven't had a drink in seven years.

595
00:33:24,368 --> 00:33:26,212
I got the chip on my
keychain to prove it,

596
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,548
from an organization called AA.

597
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,715
Really?

598
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,984
Yeah. It's a slippery slope.

599
00:33:32,109 --> 00:33:36,746
Beer, liquor, dope, coke, meth,
chicks with dicks, then jail.

600
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:41,384
Hey, what would happen
if you have a drink?

601
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,288
My entire life would fall apart.

602
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:49,201
Okay. Who wants to go?
Me.

603
00:33:49,326 --> 00:33:50,903
I would love to go home.

604
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:53,807
No, no, no, no, no.
You can't leave now.

605
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:56,609
We're just coming together
as a class, right?

606
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:57,877
No.

607
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:00,680
Heywood, it's late and
my wife is ovulating.

608
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:03,115
Hey, we got you
another mango iced tea.

609
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,085
Mango iced tea is my kryptonite.

610
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,185
It's totally.

611
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,255
Powerless to resist.

612
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,090
Okay, a few more minutes won't hurt.

613
00:34:14,284 --> 00:34:16,322
Yeah, I'd drink to that.

614
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,235
He's about to go through
the center of the Sun.

615
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,610
Sir, I'm gonna need you to wake up

616
00:34:31,735 --> 00:34:33,835
and show me some
form of identification.

617
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:40,820
Time begins and stops now.

618
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:44,757
We have a 410 with a 614 in
the 1100 block of Ocotillo.

619
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,849
What do those numbers mean?

620
00:34:47,217 --> 00:34:48,594
Come on.

621
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,829
Are you sending me
to the gas chamber?

622
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:50,931
Right this way, sir.

623
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:52,188
What is happening?

624
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:01,074
Good morning, class.

625
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,978
Okay, I'd like to start
by saying two things.

626
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:09,204
First of all,
acid is a very strong drug,

627
00:35:10,974 --> 00:35:17,246
and B, where are my
pants and underwear?

628
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,931
Excuse me, Mr. Marschz.

629
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:29,168
We need to discuss something
about the latest draft.

630
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:33,672
The role of Laertes, my part,
you've turned him into a gay.

631
00:35:33,797 --> 00:35:36,909
He's not gay.
He's bi-curious.

632
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:39,846
And the role has also been
reduced significantly.

633
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,114
Rand, theater is a living thing.

634
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:44,317
Octavio's performance the other day,

635
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,885
combined with my wife's
intense desire to get pregnant,

636
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,623
not to mention the acid,

637
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:50,990
inspired me to take some bold steps

638
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:52,726
in looking at
my relationship with my father.

639
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:55,996
That meant reducing Laertes' role.

640
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:59,032
And the gay thing, I just thought
you'd be more comfortable...

641
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,367
What? What?

642
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,159
This has nothing to do
with my sexuality!

643
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:10,710
Listen, listen,
I've given my life to this class,

644
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:14,014
and now it all goes out
the window because of him?

645
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:16,750
Because he inspired you?

646
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,875
It's what's best for the play.

647
00:36:20,844 --> 00:36:23,378
Not acceptable! I quit!

648
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:28,451
Man, you can't quit now.

649
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,123
Rand!

650
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:39,996
Rand!
What?

651
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,007
Let's talk about this.

652
00:36:42,132 --> 00:36:44,244
I hate you, you stupid, fat fucker!

653
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,981
Am I fat?

654
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:03,797
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

655
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:05,097
He got stuck inside my time machine.

656
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:07,266
His name is Jesus Christ.

657
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:10,135
Yeah. We heard
you were coming back.

658
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,862
Jesus has a rocking swimmer's bod.

659
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:17,143
Okay, can I ask you a question?

660
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:18,744
Sure.

661
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,780
What's really going on here?

662
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,871
Is Jesus, like, a swimmer?

663
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:26,418
Jesus is very lean...

664
00:37:26,543 --> 00:37:29,344
Can we please wait
until lunch to do that?

665
00:37:30,215 --> 00:37:31,313
Thank you.

666
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:37,130
Where was I?
Jesus has a swimmer's body.

667
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,164
Jesus has a swimmer's body,

668
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:42,768
and while he's one of the more
spiritual people on Earth,

669
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,304
he's also very attractive to you.

670
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,972
He's attractive to me?

671
00:37:47,097 --> 00:37:50,376
Jesus is sexy to you. Which leads
us on to the musical interlude,

672
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:52,177
<i>Rock Me, Sexy Jesus.</i>

673
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:03,255
Okay, you are
40-something minutes late.

674
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,146
I can't do the play.

675
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,092
What?

676
00:38:07,217 --> 00:38:08,827
My dad's making me quit the play.

677
00:38:08,952 --> 00:38:10,262
That's impossible.
You're the lead.

678
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:11,764
He said, "No way."

679
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:15,257
Goddamn macho bastards
and their fear of the arts.

680
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:18,094
They just don't get it!

681
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:22,141
Okay, we're fighting this.

682
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,943
Even if we have to take
on the whole ghetto.

683
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:26,012
No, wait.
What do you mean?

684
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:26,945
We're going to your house. Now.

685
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,047
No, no, no, we can't do that.

686
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,681
It's not a good idea.

687
00:38:29,806 --> 00:38:31,317
My father tried to stand in
the way of my dreams, too.

688
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,418
He's dead now,

689
00:38:33,543 --> 00:38:37,157
but you could say, like Hamlet's ghost,
I'm still haunted by him.

690
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:38,791
Because he caused me so much pain,

691
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,860
which is why I tried
to become an actor,

692
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:44,219
which caused me so much pain.

693
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:52,972
You can't let your
ethnic narrow-mindedness

694
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,909
stop your son from
thriving in our culture.

695
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:58,545
I have to take exception
to that characterization.

696
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,280
Heywood's a bad boy.

697
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:02,081
He's a gang-banger.
A deadbeat.

698
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,005
But he also has a gift.

699
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:06,041
Who is Heywood?

700
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:09,010
Your son, Heywood Jablomey.

701
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,083
I just got that.

702
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:17,130
Octavio doesn't belong to a gang.

703
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:20,032
He's got a 3.9
and an early acceptance to Brown.

704
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:22,217
He does?

705
00:39:22,342 --> 00:39:24,403
Yes, our concerns about
the play are of a different nature.

706
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,172
If it's the sex and violence,
I can totally tone that down.

707
00:39:27,297 --> 00:39:28,507
No, we are fine with those.

708
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,210
Then what is it?

709
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:34,447
We merely expressed
our absolute distaste for a sequel

710
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:38,016
to what is arguably the greatest
play in the English language.

711
00:39:38,141 --> 00:39:41,443
Not to mention the quality of
the writing, which is quite low.

712
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:48,927
Well, no offense, but what
the hockey-puck do you know?

713
00:39:49,052 --> 00:39:51,130
Well, I've published nine novels.

714
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:53,266
I have a PhD in literature.

715
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,367
My wife is a painter.

716
00:39:55,492 --> 00:39:58,760
She currently has an exhibit
at the Guggenheim in Bilbao.

717
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:00,528
Okay.

718
00:40:01,498 --> 00:40:02,565
Then...

719
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,077
Help me fix my play!

720
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:07,045
I'm trying to save drama!

721
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:10,215
You have Hamlet using a time machine

722
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,918
to stop Gertrude from
drinking the poison,

723
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:15,355
to stop Ophelia from drowning.

724
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,557
You're taking the tragedy
out of the tragedy.

725
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:23,262
I just wondered why in
<i>Hamlet 1</i> everybody has to die.

726
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:27,199
It's such a downer! I mean, if Hamlet
had had just a little bit of therapy,

727
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,034
he could have turned
everything around.

728
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:32,271
Everybody deserves a second chance!

729
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:36,675
Yes, well, we'll let Octavio
make up his own mind.

730
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,644
Thank you for taking the time.

731
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,679
Let me show you the way out.

732
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,614
Could we talk more?

733
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:42,949
I would love to get your notes.

734
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:44,483
I would do anything...
I'd do chores.

735
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,152
I'd clean your rain gutters.

736
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,820
I'm afraid we don't
have rain gutters.

737
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,612
You're a liar, everybody
has rain gutters!

738
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,661
Mr. Rocker?

739
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,253
Yes, what is it, Rand?

740
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,356
Here.

741
00:41:03,126 --> 00:41:05,271
<i>Hamlet 2?</i>

742
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,096
It's the play Mr. Marschz wrote.

743
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:10,108
What about it?

744
00:41:10,233 --> 00:41:12,201
I think you need
to take a look at it.

745
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:14,447
Why?

746
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:16,148
Let's just say that
when you get to the scene

747
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:17,215
where Gertrude
gives Hamlet a hand job,

748
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,985
you'll sense my drift.

749
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,119
Did you just say "hand job"?

750
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:22,054
Yes, I did.

751
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,590
He thinks he's going to
save drama with this play.

752
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:29,295
Mr. Rocker, if you care about
decency and if you love this country,

753
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,699
you will stop Dana Marschz.
Take him down.

754
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,367
Then take him from behind!

755
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,608
Go Mustangs!

756
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:45,043
Hey!

757
00:41:45,168 --> 00:41:46,434
I'm here for her.
I'm here for her.

758
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:54,519
Apologies, the Snackatorium is no
longer available, regrettably, because

759
00:41:54,644 --> 00:41:58,358
the ladies who make macaroni
and cheese are getting very territorial.

760
00:41:58,483 --> 00:42:05,197
So without further ado, I'd like
to introduce you to Elisabeth Shue.

761
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:07,367
Elisabeth Shue, get up here.

762
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:09,190
All right.

763
00:42:12,597 --> 00:42:13,539
Thank you.

764
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:17,275
Thank you so much for having me.

765
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,545
God, I really have a tough time
speaking in front of people.

766
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,347
I get a little nervous.

767
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:22,581
I'm way more nervous than you.

768
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,507
I'm like... My brain is like mush.

769
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,322
Elisabeth Shue, is she real?

770
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:31,657
Somebody pinch my ass.

771
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:34,126
It's inappropriate.
I'm sorry. It's just...

772
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:35,594
Should we just take questions?

773
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,164
That'd be great.

774
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,889
Okay, class, questions for Ms. Shue.

775
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:44,369
Someone other than Epiphany.

776
00:42:44,494 --> 00:42:47,572
Okay, not all at once.

777
00:42:47,697 --> 00:42:51,577
You guys, come on,
I asked you to prepare a few questions.

778
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:52,811
You know, I'm a reasonable guy.

779
00:42:52,936 --> 00:42:54,480
I don't lose it when I...

780
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:56,181
Jesus Christ!

781
00:42:56,306 --> 00:42:57,873
Can we not share this space in peace?

782
00:43:05,715 --> 00:43:07,693
Epiphany?

783
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:12,097
Hi. I just want to say I think
your make-up is pretty.

784
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:13,322
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

785
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:15,201
It is nice.

786
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:18,237
What about Mr.
Alpha Male up there?

787
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:19,561
Got a question for Ms. Shue?

788
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:21,730
Yeah.

789
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:25,644
Who are you?
Come on!

790
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,347
Could you not even Google her?

791
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:31,851
<i>The Karate Kid,</i> the crane.
"Wax on, wax off."

792
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:35,655
<i>Soapdish. Dreamer,</i>
with the fucking horse.

793
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,846
Any of that shit ring a bell?

794
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:41,382
Sorry. Pardon my French.

795
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,362
I've heard the word "shit" before.

796
00:43:44,487 --> 00:43:47,599
In Hollywood,
you pretty much have to swim in it.

797
00:43:47,724 --> 00:43:48,534
That is funny, that's...

798
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,360
Excuse me for a second.

799
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:59,244
What do you miss about acting?

800
00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:00,780
You know what I really
miss about acting?

801
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:04,349
I miss kissing.
In love scenes.

802
00:44:04,474 --> 00:44:07,753
I had so much fun making out
with all those cute actors.

803
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:10,378
I would love to stay and hear this.

804
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:13,626
Yeah, I think if I had
one complaint about nursing,

805
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:17,452
it would be that you don't get
to make out with your patients.

806
00:44:22,525 --> 00:44:25,637
It's fricking exciting having
Elisabeth Shue in class.

807
00:44:25,762 --> 00:44:27,672
Because of its unwholesome content,

808
00:44:27,797 --> 00:44:31,000
the school cannot allow
the exhibition of <i>Hamlet 2.</i>

809
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:33,246
Where did you get that?

810
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:34,847
Entirely beside the point.

811
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:37,081
Did Rand give it to you?

812
00:44:37,206 --> 00:44:39,318
Nudity and pornography are not
permitted on the school premises.

813
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:41,677
There's no nudity or pornography!

814
00:44:42,445 --> 00:44:43,389
Minimal.

815
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,824
You have Satan French-kissing

816
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:47,159
the President of the
United States of America!

817
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:50,630
It's a parting embrace before
the moment of damnation.

818
00:44:50,755 --> 00:44:52,364
The climax of a modernist dance.

819
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:54,199
I think when all is said and done,

820
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:55,800
you will find it quite moving.

821
00:44:55,925 --> 00:44:58,271
Trust me, I won't.

822
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:00,505
We're 10 days away.
Things are in motion.

823
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:01,806
Art is happening.

824
00:45:01,931 --> 00:45:03,708
Well, stop it.

825
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:05,744
You can't stop art.

826
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,612
You're shut down, Marx!

827
00:45:07,737 --> 00:45:09,514
No, you are.
You are.

828
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:12,617
You never believed in me, Daddy!
I hate you!

829
00:45:12,742 --> 00:45:15,521
We're putting this play on, and if
you don't like it, then tough titties,

830
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:17,646
you ass-turd monkey-fucker!

831
00:45:26,489 --> 00:45:27,789
My God!

832
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,003
Let me see.

833
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:44,684
Shue.

834
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:47,219
How do you keep your head held
high when people keep throwing

835
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:50,222
steaming piles of crap in your face?

836
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:52,014
I know, I know.

837
00:45:53,483 --> 00:45:55,918
That's why I got out of the business.

838
00:46:08,998 --> 00:46:10,342
Well, fuck you, too.

839
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:11,699
I have to elevate it.

840
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:16,849
It's not broken and,
yes, I will still be able

841
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:20,442
to play any and all
musical instruments.

842
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:25,847
I have to tell you something.

843
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,521
I'm pregnant.

844
00:46:36,594 --> 00:46:37,458
Really?

845
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,608
Are you shitting me?

846
00:46:43,733 --> 00:46:45,099
No, no.

847
00:46:49,005 --> 00:46:51,317
Christ in a basket, Dana.
That's too tight.

848
00:46:51,442 --> 00:46:52,617
And it will always be too tight.

849
00:46:52,742 --> 00:46:55,510
I will never not hug
this unborn baby!

850
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:08,791
It's like he's giving me hope.

851
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:10,659
Who?

852
00:47:11,661 --> 00:47:12,594
God.

853
00:47:15,932 --> 00:47:18,010
<i>At this point,
it felt to Dana</i>

854
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:21,079
<i>as if the air was
perfumed with possibility.</i>

855
00:47:21,204 --> 00:47:25,050
<i>But just as Icarus flew
high on wings of wax,</i>

856
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:28,353
<i>oblivious to his impending doom,</i>

857
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:31,646
<i>so was poor, dear Dana Marschz.</i>

858
00:47:45,728 --> 00:47:47,463
Well, I'm lost.

859
00:47:52,168 --> 00:47:56,014
Is blue the right color

860
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:58,907
for a controversial piece of
socio-political agit-prop theater?

861
00:48:01,512 --> 00:48:03,545
I think blue makes people sad.

862
00:48:10,788 --> 00:48:12,019
Yes, it does.

863
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,590
There's also orange.

864
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:16,692
Orange.

865
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:20,940
The color of fire.

866
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:25,567
Of ripe tangerines,
of the poet's harvest moon!

867
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:35,177
Glenn, we've done it!

868
00:48:41,684 --> 00:48:43,585
Stop staring at me.

869
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:45,820
Okay, all right. Okay.

870
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:50,224
It's ridiculous.
But I love it.

871
00:48:52,563 --> 00:48:55,106
Okay, guys, I am
pretty effing excited

872
00:48:55,231 --> 00:48:58,643
to announce that the musical
accompaniment to our play

873
00:48:58,768 --> 00:49:02,570
will be provided by
the Gay Men's Chorus of Tucson!

874
00:49:04,842 --> 00:49:07,753
<i>Just a steel-town girl
on a Saturday night</i>

875
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:11,090
<i>Looking for the fight of her life</i>

876
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:14,159
<i>In the real-time world
no one sees her at all</i>

877
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:17,797
<i>They all say she's crazy</i>

878
00:49:17,922 --> 00:49:20,932
<i>Locking rhythms to
the beat of her heart</i>

879
00:49:21,057 --> 00:49:24,135
<i>Changing movement into light</i>

880
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:27,672
<i>She has danced into the danger zone</i>

881
00:49:27,797 --> 00:49:32,143
<i>When the dancer becomes the dance</i>

882
00:49:32,268 --> 00:49:35,815
<i>It can cut you like a knife</i>

883
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:39,217
Hey, guys, thanks a lot for
donating your wire-work services.

884
00:49:39,342 --> 00:49:41,152
It really helped out a lot.

885
00:49:41,277 --> 00:49:43,755
When did you guys get started?

886
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,759
We seen them
<i>Kill Bill</i> movies, like, 20 times,

887
00:49:46,884 --> 00:49:49,494
and we said, "Shit, we got some wire,

888
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:51,463
"we got some harnesses."

889
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:54,065
So we get to work in the backyard,

890
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:56,835
and next thing you know,
we're in show business.

891
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,472
So this is your first attempt?

892
00:49:59,597 --> 00:50:00,972
Yes, sir.

893
00:50:01,097 --> 00:50:02,831
Now hold on, girl.

894
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:07,202
Three, two, one.

895
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:17,239
That's cool.

896
00:50:17,364 --> 00:50:20,793
Okay. So this is the Danish
castle/porno theater/time machine.

897
00:50:20,918 --> 00:50:23,628
It's fantastic.

898
00:50:23,753 --> 00:50:27,867
I don't know what it means, but I think
it's the best set I've ever seen.

899
00:50:27,992 --> 00:50:29,168
Yeah?
Yeah.

900
00:50:29,293 --> 00:50:30,835
Who said shop class was useless?

901
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,838
I don't know.

902
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:34,039
Wait, somebody said that?

903
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:35,731
It's a figure of speech.

904
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:37,710
Hey, M.
Hey.

905
00:50:37,835 --> 00:50:39,077
Hey, my buddy's meth lab burned down.

906
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,913
I'm sorry to hear that.

907
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,148
No, it's going to be some pretty
cherry footage for the play.

908
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:45,050
Well, excellent.
Hey, girls.

909
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:46,619
Hey, Mr. Marschz.
What?

910
00:50:46,744 --> 00:50:48,521
I was thinking,
what if me and my whoadies

911
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:51,590
rolled up in low-riders
on stage in the third act?

912
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,092
That sounds kind of dangerous.

913
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:54,559
Yeah, maybe so.

914
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:57,762
Which is why I want to do it.

915
00:50:57,887 --> 00:51:00,155
We are not making safe theater.

916
00:51:02,326 --> 00:51:03,891
I'm in the wrong place.

917
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:11,733
Jesus Jones! Rocker's
changed the locks.

918
00:51:14,103 --> 00:51:17,081
That is the first shot across the bow,
boys and girls.

919
00:51:17,206 --> 00:51:19,952
Just like that wonderful film
<i>Master and Commander,</i>

920
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:23,054
starring the terrifyingly real
Aussie badboy, Russell Crowe.

921
00:51:23,179 --> 00:51:25,858
Five more seconds.

922
00:51:25,983 --> 00:51:29,751
Okay, Chuy, breaking and entering
is neither cool nor terrific.

923
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:33,021
But we got shit to do.

924
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:39,271
Hey, you get off school
property in the next 10 seconds

925
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:41,639
or I'm gonna have
the Tucson police department

926
00:51:41,764 --> 00:51:44,331
so far up your ass you're
gonna wish you were a girl.

927
00:52:03,219 --> 00:52:05,597
"What about <i>Hamlet 2</i>
could possibly offend

928
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:07,632
"Principal Rocker to such a degree?

929
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,601
"Or is offense the offense at all?

930
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:11,737
"Truth is a nebulous commodity.

931
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:15,974
"As Roland Barthes tells us, 'Multiple
perspectives cannot ever coalesce.'"

932
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:17,643
Does anybody know what this means?

933
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:18,844
Did you see this
article in the paper?

934
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,244
We're already reading it, woman.

935
00:52:20,369 --> 00:52:22,246
Not the school paper.
<i>The News Press.</i>

936
00:52:22,371 --> 00:52:23,949
I stole it from Starbucks.

937
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:25,384
You really think you're street,
don't you?

938
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:27,385
Don't fuck with me,
homey! I'll cut you.

939
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:31,146
I liked you better when you
were an uptight racist bitch.

940
00:52:32,081 --> 00:52:33,958
My God.

941
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:35,860
"Why is the school board
afraid of this man?"

942
00:52:35,985 --> 00:52:37,161
That's a picture of me.

943
00:52:37,286 --> 00:52:39,998
I was an extra in
an Al Jazeera TV movie.

944
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:42,858
I regret it now,
but what a fun bunch of guys.

945
00:52:43,893 --> 00:52:45,003
Dana Marsha?

946
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:46,094
Marschz. Yes?

947
00:52:47,396 --> 00:52:48,806
Consider yourself served.

948
00:52:48,931 --> 00:52:50,074
Thank you.

949
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:54,246
What a nice man.
A smile costs nothing.

950
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:56,882
Shit, this is a cease
and desist order from the school board.

951
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,817
What does that mean?

952
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:00,753
That means you can be arrested
for putting on this play.

953
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:04,179
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, mister, un-serve me!

954
00:53:22,565 --> 00:53:24,143
All right, mystery man.

955
00:53:24,268 --> 00:53:25,411
Why have you brought us here?

956
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:26,711
Yeah.

957
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:27,780
Yeah, why?

958
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:29,380
This is Joy Junction.

959
00:53:29,505 --> 00:53:31,150
You know, that positive ionic flow.

960
00:53:31,275 --> 00:53:34,853
Jean-Paul, the crew, Burning Man,
the lunar cycle, yeah.

961
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:35,987
So?

962
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:37,155
Yeah, yo.

963
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,179
Yeah, yo.

964
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,360
Okay, you started to say something

965
00:53:41,485 --> 00:53:42,728
and didn't finish your sentence.

966
00:53:42,853 --> 00:53:44,228
You didn't?
No, no, you.

967
00:53:44,353 --> 00:53:45,898
No, I know you.

968
00:53:46,023 --> 00:53:47,298
No, N-O, "no."

969
00:53:47,423 --> 00:53:49,802
No, no, more yes.
You know, less no.

970
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:52,393
Okay, I'm a little
cuckoo-bananas here.

971
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:54,739
Look, they throw parties here.

972
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:56,041
The promoters are at Burning Man.

973
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,976
We can use the space.

974
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:11,123
He does lighting and stuff like that.
See Vitamin J,

975
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,826
he acts like a huge dumbass,

976
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:16,016
but he really knows what he's doing.

977
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:23,090
Let there be light.

978
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,161
My eyes!

979
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:34,313
Mr. Marashka?

980
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:38,117
Who? It's Marschz. Yes.

981
00:54:38,242 --> 00:54:41,219
Cricket Feldstein,
American Civil Liberties Union.

982
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,077
We spoke on the phone.

983
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:45,490
The ACLU.

984
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:48,893
I thought you were a talent agent,
like UTA or CAA.

985
00:54:49,018 --> 00:54:51,295
But totally not disappointed.

986
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:54,800
If you're wondering about the Feldstein,
I married a Jew.

987
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:56,869
It's my understanding
that there are forces

988
00:54:56,994 --> 00:54:59,338
trying to stop you
from performing <i>Hamlet 2.</i>

989
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:00,838
You received a cease and desist order

990
00:55:00,963 --> 00:55:01,974
in regards to this performance?

991
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:04,391
Yes.

992
00:55:04,516 --> 00:55:06,811
I think we have a First Amendment
case on our hands, Mr. Marashka.

993
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:08,413
It's Marschz.
You really think so?

994
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:11,250
Abso-fucking-lutely.

995
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:13,552
No one is shutting down this play.

996
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:16,221
The Justice Department
and the so-called Supreme Court

997
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:18,190
can suck my balls.

998
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,057
What do they have to do with this?
My balls?

999
00:55:20,182 --> 00:55:21,692
No, the other thing.

1000
00:55:21,817 --> 00:55:23,327
I'm a short blond chick,
but I play to the death.

1001
00:55:23,452 --> 00:55:26,565
I pick cases that I can win
because I wanna win big.

1002
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,967
Cases with controversy and headlines

1003
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:31,869
and steaming piles of shit
flying left and right.

1004
00:55:31,994 --> 00:55:34,206
Mostly left.
How's that sound?

1005
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,396
Fine.

1006
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,179
Are you on my side?
Yes.

1007
00:55:40,304 --> 00:55:42,036
Great, let's do it!
Okay then.

1008
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:44,048
Do I need to sign anything?

1009
00:55:44,173 --> 00:55:45,572
No, don't sign anything!

1010
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,590
I think the play's
gonna be really good.

1011
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:53,157
It's irrelevant.

1012
00:55:53,282 --> 00:55:54,449
Okay.

1013
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:08,472
Goddamn gravel!
The bane of my existence!

1014
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:13,434
Brights!

1015
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:23,143
My God!

1016
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,659
Shut down that piece of shit play.

1017
00:56:45,768 --> 00:56:47,735
Bruised, but not broken.

1018
00:56:50,139 --> 00:56:52,985
Turns out my play has
divided the community,

1019
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:54,085
but I shall not be deterred.

1020
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:55,487
Dana.

1021
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:57,655
Hang on, I'm going to
run myself a big bath.

1022
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:00,358
Dana. I have had, hands down,

1023
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:03,195
the worst day ever.

1024
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:08,367
Hey, there's no delicate
way of saying this except...

1025
00:57:08,492 --> 00:57:11,068
Except Gary and I are together,
and we're a couple,

1026
00:57:11,193 --> 00:57:13,605
and we're moving out now.

1027
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:16,407
Yeah, I'm gonna run myself a big
<i>Arthur</i> -style bath with bubbles.

1028
00:57:16,532 --> 00:57:18,010
I'm sorry.

1029
00:57:18,135 --> 00:57:19,610
And I'm gonna put on my top hat,

1030
00:57:19,735 --> 00:57:21,579
and wish all my troubles
into a cornfield.

1031
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:23,981
That's what I'm gonna do.

1032
00:57:24,106 --> 00:57:25,918
Didn't you hear what I just said?

1033
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:28,253
Yes, I did, funny bunny.

1034
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:29,454
Dana.

1035
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:31,923
We're packed, we're leaving.

1036
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:34,148
We're moving to San Diego.

1037
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:36,418
God, I almost believe you.

1038
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,153
Believe it!

1039
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:42,434
But why? You're my wife.

1040
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,391
Your wife is leaving you.

1041
00:57:48,664 --> 00:57:51,143
Gary and I have been getting
closer for a while now,

1042
00:57:51,268 --> 00:57:55,246
and turns out we are very compatible.

1043
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:58,650
As long as he keeps his mouth shut.
Anyway.

1044
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:03,054
Look, you've been so busy with
your play, and these things happen.

1045
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:05,112
So, don't sweat it. It's...

1046
00:58:06,782 --> 00:58:09,117
You'll be much happier without me.

1047
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:12,454
What about the baby?

1048
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,467
The doctor told me a while ago

1049
00:58:16,592 --> 00:58:18,704
that you've been shooting blanks.

1050
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:20,862
I should have said something.

1051
00:58:24,568 --> 00:58:26,166
That must mean...

1052
00:58:31,173 --> 00:58:32,239
Wow.

1053
00:58:32,608 --> 00:58:33,675
Yeah.

1054
00:58:34,543 --> 00:58:35,643
Yeah.

1055
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:45,253
Brie, I'm starting to think
you are not a very nice person.

1056
00:58:46,123 --> 00:58:48,155
Just wake up, okay?

1057
00:58:53,262 --> 00:58:55,606
Left you a protein
shake in the fridge.

1058
00:58:55,731 --> 00:58:57,009
Gary, let's go.

1059
00:58:57,134 --> 00:58:58,266
It's strawberry.

1060
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:15,027
Electric and phone bills
are right there,

1061
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:17,318
and the rent's due on Thursday.

1062
00:59:20,824 --> 00:59:22,623
Good luck with the play.

1063
00:59:25,561 --> 00:59:28,262
You really will be
better off without me.

1064
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:33,934
Come on.

1065
00:59:45,581 --> 00:59:48,215
<i>She's a maniac</i>

1066
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:51,885
<i>Maniac on the floor</i>

1067
00:59:55,791 --> 01:00:00,494
<i>And she's dancing
like she's never danced before</i>

1068
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:45,340
Boy.

1069
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:03,423
Fuck!

1070
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:12,567
Hey, what's cheap and strong?

1071
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:15,036
Grain alcohol.

1072
01:01:19,608 --> 01:01:22,686
I feel like I'm in a cage.

1073
01:01:22,811 --> 01:01:27,614
And I feel like Nicolas Cage in
<i>Leaving Las Vegas.</i>

1074
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:31,730
Starring my good friend,
Elisabeth Shue.

1075
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:45,242
I'm sorry.
Sorry about that.

1076
01:01:45,367 --> 01:01:46,545
Can I use your bathroom?

1077
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:47,768
No.

1078
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:53,407
Hey, we got the TVs.

1079
01:01:54,376 --> 01:01:55,887
There's a hundred sets
in there, woman!

1080
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:57,489
Where did you get them all?

1081
01:01:57,614 --> 01:01:59,490
Stole them from white folks, dawg.

1082
01:01:59,615 --> 01:02:01,826
I have to say something, guys.

1083
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:04,262
I really think
Mr. Marschz is bipolar.

1084
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:05,563
Just like my cousin.

1085
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:07,364
But she takes pills.

1086
01:02:07,489 --> 01:02:09,668
He's not bipolar.
He's a freak.

1087
01:02:09,793 --> 01:02:11,936
Do you think he realizes
that every time he wears a dress

1088
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,704
he's flashing his balls at us?

1089
01:02:13,829 --> 01:02:14,940
You know, where is he anyway?

1090
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,242
He was supposed to be
here two hours ago.

1091
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:18,777
Maybe he's out shopping for a dress.

1092
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:20,367
He should buy some underwear.

1093
01:02:23,505 --> 01:02:25,505
Who do you think you are
talking like that, white girl?

1094
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:31,411
I heard everything.
I heard everything!

1095
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:37,394
I haven't bought an item of
clothing in over 10 years

1096
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:38,730
because I don't get
paid for this job.

1097
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:40,798
Did you know that?

1098
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:44,559
I work for gas money,
which is why I skate.

1099
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:48,496
That and the DUI.

1100
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:56,903
My life is a parody of a tragedy!

1101
01:02:59,842 --> 01:03:03,610
My wife left me.
Baby wasn't mine.

1102
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:07,581
People are trying to run me over.

1103
01:03:08,784 --> 01:03:10,485
What are we supposed to do?

1104
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:12,987
It doesn't matter.

1105
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:16,034
We're not gonna get this play on.

1106
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:18,025
We might as well give up now!

1107
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,536
What?

1108
01:03:19,661 --> 01:03:20,661
He works for gas money?

1109
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:23,097
That is so sad.

1110
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,639
Mr. M!

1111
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:34,976
Mr. M!

1112
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:38,722
What happened?

1113
01:03:38,847 --> 01:03:39,981
Get away from me, you devil bitches.

1114
01:03:41,451 --> 01:03:42,949
Leave me to the vultures.

1115
01:03:44,186 --> 01:03:45,619
Pussy!

1116
01:03:48,557 --> 01:03:50,601
Yolanda.

1117
01:03:50,726 --> 01:03:53,371
You come in here and tell
us all to be artistic,

1118
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:55,806
and put on your crazy-ass play,

1119
01:03:55,931 --> 01:04:00,034
and when things get a little rough,
you act like a fucking pussy?

1120
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:07,985
Yolanda, you don't say much,
but when you do, it sure packs a wallop.

1121
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:09,820
She's right!

1122
01:04:09,945 --> 01:04:11,822
Okay, you've had a pretty bad day,
I'll give you that.

1123
01:04:11,947 --> 01:04:13,057
But that doesn't mean you give up.

1124
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:14,659
Why not?

1125
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:15,827
Nobody cares.

1126
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:16,927
Yeah, we do.

1127
01:04:17,052 --> 01:04:18,719
I don't want your pity.

1128
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:22,123
Man, you keep talking about
making us extraordinary.

1129
01:04:23,525 --> 01:04:25,103
That's from <i>Dead Poets.</i>

1130
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:28,005
Well, you're teaching us
something really important.

1131
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,840
I am? What is it?

1132
01:04:29,965 --> 01:04:31,476
It doesn't matter how
much talent we lack,

1133
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:33,344
as long as we have enthusiasm.

1134
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:35,570
That's truth.
Because I lack talent.

1135
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:40,652
The football team, the wrestling team

1136
01:04:40,777 --> 01:04:43,088
and all the seniors
are gonna be like security

1137
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:46,023
and kick the asses of anyone
who tries to stop this play.

1138
01:04:46,148 --> 01:04:48,092
Yeah. And I got some friends
to watch the parking lot

1139
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,527
just in case we have any trouble,
you know what I'm saying?

1140
01:04:50,652 --> 01:04:52,786
And we're also sold out.

1141
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:55,065
What?

1142
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:56,800
Mr. M, you're not getting it.

1143
01:04:56,925 --> 01:04:58,001
Like, all the tickets were bought.

1144
01:04:58,126 --> 01:04:59,771
Channel 5 is coming.

1145
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,106
And I got a call from one
of Elton John's people,

1146
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:02,907
something about permission.

1147
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:06,567
And there was a message from
this guy at the <i>New York Times.</i>

1148
01:05:07,704 --> 01:05:08,869
Mr. M,

1149
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:12,940
we don't wanna give up.

1150
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:15,775
I just get scared.

1151
01:05:17,045 --> 01:05:18,655
Every time I try to go for something,

1152
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:21,047
my heart gets stomped
on like a baby kitten.

1153
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:25,597
That's no reason to give up.

1154
01:05:25,722 --> 01:05:27,722
Maybe it is.
No, it's not.

1155
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:37,898
Help him up.

1156
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:44,271
Let's go to work.

1157
01:05:48,677 --> 01:05:53,681
Okay, hey, guys, my skate is stuck.

1158
01:05:57,686 --> 01:05:59,286
I'm such a dick.

1159
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:12,577
Wait, what are you
doing? Let go of me.

1160
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:16,581
I'm not interested in this
monkey-spunk play. Come on!

1161
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:18,115
Ticket holders only.

1162
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,751
This event is sold out.

1163
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:23,688
If you don't have a ticket,
get the fuck out of my face.

1164
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,989
I am revoking permission
for my son to appear tonight.

1165
01:06:26,114 --> 01:06:27,057
I am, too.

1166
01:06:27,182 --> 01:06:28,282
And so am I.

1167
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:30,161
But why now?

1168
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:32,697
I heard the play was disgusting.

1169
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,898
How can you say that
if you haven't seen it?

1170
01:06:35,023 --> 01:06:37,469
What about this <i>Sexy Jesus</i> song?

1171
01:06:37,594 --> 01:06:39,804
I mean, that's just disrespectful.

1172
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:43,240
Look, it's about if Jesus
came to Earth in modern times,

1173
01:06:43,365 --> 01:06:45,742
he would have to market
himself like a celebrity.

1174
01:06:45,867 --> 01:06:47,512
It's very thoughtful.

1175
01:06:47,637 --> 01:06:49,813
That's an oversimplification, but...

1176
01:06:49,938 --> 01:06:52,916
I don't care to see my son
used as a political pawn!

1177
01:06:53,041 --> 01:06:55,219
I'm doing this play
for my own reasons.

1178
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,688
You know, according to
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,

1179
01:06:57,813 --> 01:06:59,690
if you sign a consent form,
that means you're giving consent.

1180
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:00,992
And you can't take that form back,

1181
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:02,260
you can't take your signature off it.

1182
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:03,795
You signed it, you signed consent.

1183
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,262
So end of deal, okay.
End of story.

1184
01:07:05,387 --> 01:07:07,097
Sorry, you guys,
but you totally gave consent.

1185
01:07:07,222 --> 01:07:09,567
You don't control our kids!

1186
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:12,226
Wake up call!
You don't control your kids!

1187
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:14,905
Now get out of my performance space,

1188
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:16,940
before I have security,
a.k.a. the 2nd Avenue Angels,

1189
01:07:17,065 --> 01:07:18,833
remove your sorry asses.

1190
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:26,050
How did you get the balls to do that?

1191
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:27,818
I'm still a little drunk.

1192
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:50,742
What if I have to go to the bathroom?

1193
01:07:50,867 --> 01:07:53,701
Okay, I'll just piss on
your pretty little gym shoes.

1194
01:07:57,005 --> 01:08:01,251
Welcome to West Mesa High
Drama's final performance.

1195
01:08:01,376 --> 01:08:04,556
If you are moved by tonight's work,

1196
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:07,824
please go forward
and support arts education...

1197
01:08:07,949 --> 01:08:10,016
Eat shit and die, you tramp.

1198
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:15,599
Let go of me!
Hey, hands off!

1199
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:19,760
And please take this opportunity
to turn off all cell phones.

1200
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:28,746
It's the celestial message.

1201
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:32,216
The portal to infinity is wide open.

1202
01:08:42,185 --> 01:08:47,121
Yeah! Fuck yeah!

1203
01:09:36,905 --> 01:09:38,349
Look. I studied French at Vassar.

1204
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:40,818
I'm not getting any of this.

1205
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:42,877
Well, can you give us an update?

1206
01:09:44,447 --> 01:09:47,324
Free speech is alive
and well in Tucson,

1207
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:49,550
so go and tell the <i>mundo.</i>

1208
01:09:50,485 --> 01:09:52,195
I think it's going terrific.

1209
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,921
Are people still walking out?

1210
01:09:55,992 --> 01:09:58,118
Mr. Marschz,

1211
01:09:58,243 --> 01:10:00,371
this is the most important theatrical
event in the history of Tucson.

1212
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:02,340
I have to be a part of it.

1213
01:10:02,465 --> 01:10:05,309
Rand, that is a very brave
and generous thing to...

1214
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:07,177
Piff took the fries.

1215
01:10:07,302 --> 01:10:08,912
I've been going to
a shrink five days a week

1216
01:10:09,037 --> 01:10:11,048
and I started on anti-depressants

1217
01:10:11,173 --> 01:10:14,952
and I'm much more comfortable
with my sexuality.

1218
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:17,889
I'd be happy to play
Laertes as bi-curious.

1219
01:10:18,014 --> 01:10:19,445
That's wonderful!

1220
01:10:20,283 --> 01:10:22,248
And I forgive you.

1221
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:30,301
Okay. Stop it.
Go get changed.

1222
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:31,524
Okay.

1223
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:41,836
<i>Sometimes I feel
like I'm drifting in space</i>

1224
01:10:43,171 --> 01:10:49,109
<i>I think my heart-soul
is falling from grace</i>

1225
01:10:50,846 --> 01:10:55,993
<i>Therapy's taken me to a better place</i>

1226
01:10:56,118 --> 01:11:02,734
<i>So why do I feel, why do I feel</i>

1227
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:07,171
<i>Why do I feel like
I've been raped in the face?</i>

1228
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:10,774
Raped in the face?

1229
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:13,911
<i>Maybe it's buried emotions</i>

1230
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:17,748
<i>Or maybe the wrong medication</i>

1231
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:21,018
<i>I simply go through the motions</i>

1232
01:11:21,143 --> 01:11:24,310
<i>They say I need a vacation</i>

1233
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:29,260
<i>I really do feel like a sexual victim</i>

1234
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:32,529
<i>With dark memories of a rigid dictum</i>

1235
01:11:32,654 --> 01:11:34,097
This is disgusting!
Shut up!

1236
01:11:34,222 --> 01:11:37,400
<i>This means I love you, he murmured</i>

1237
01:11:37,525 --> 01:11:40,971
<i>This will be our little secret</i>

1238
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:44,274
<i>You'll wind up horribly murdered</i>

1239
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:47,635
<i>If you should dare not to keep it</i>

1240
01:11:49,671 --> 01:11:55,485
<i>I know the topic of rape isn't nice</i>

1241
01:11:55,610 --> 01:12:01,458
<i>Don't bring it up
when you're breaking the ice</i>

1242
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:07,331
<i>Is that why you are
so quick to decline</i>

1243
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:13,203
<i>To hear this oral fixation of mine?</i>

1244
01:12:13,328 --> 01:12:16,841
<i>My head spins like a wheel
As I make this appeal</i>

1245
01:12:16,966 --> 01:12:20,444
<i>If I'm lost then I'll squeal
It's a pretty raw deal</i>

1246
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:23,847
<i>When they force you to kneel
Holy fuck, it's so real</i>

1247
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:25,515
<i>When you're being</i>

1248
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,106
<i>Raped in the face</i>

1249
01:12:56,572 --> 01:12:59,250
<i>He's totally the man
The man with the plan</i>

1250
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:02,309
<i>He traveled through time
in an awesome custom van</i>

1251
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:06,423
<i>Moralistically,
he taught us to be good</i>

1252
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:11,028
<i>How to set our souls free
And do all the shit we should</i>

1253
01:13:11,153 --> 01:13:13,930
<i>Now we do the right deeds
We go to church and such</i>

1254
01:13:14,055 --> 01:13:18,336
<i>And we stopped smoking weed
Well, at least not as much</i>

1255
01:13:18,461 --> 01:13:21,538
<i>And we can't forget to mention
The golden rule</i>

1256
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:24,207
<i>Do unto others as you would have them</i>

1257
01:13:24,332 --> 01:13:25,542
<i>Slam, bam, spank you, ma'am</i>

1258
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:27,944
<i>Do unto you!</i>

1259
01:13:31,172 --> 01:13:33,317
My God, it's Jesus!

1260
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:35,442
My God, it's Jesus!

1261
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:41,524
You're so hot!
My God, I love you!

1262
01:13:41,649 --> 01:13:42,894
I wanna party with you, Jesus.

1263
01:13:43,019 --> 01:13:45,296
Jesus.

1264
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:48,099
<i>Rock me,
rock me, rock me, sexy Jesus</i>

1265
01:13:48,224 --> 01:13:51,234
<i>He died for our sins
You got to believe us</i>

1266
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:53,970
<i>Rock me, rock me, rock me, sexy Jesus</i>

1267
01:13:54,095 --> 01:13:56,539
<i>All night long</i>

1268
01:13:56,664 --> 01:14:00,278
I'm simultaneously
horrified and fascinated.

1269
01:14:00,403 --> 01:14:03,079
<i>We're really amazed
You got to believe us</i>

1270
01:14:03,204 --> 01:14:04,047
<i>Rock me, rock me, rock me, sexy Jesus</i>

1271
01:14:04,172 --> 01:14:05,615
Blasphemy! Blasphemy!

1272
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:08,618
<i>All night long</i>

1273
01:14:08,743 --> 01:14:11,288
<i>He lays down science,
really blows my mind</i>

1274
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:14,557
<i>But he's also got abs
that transcend space and time</i>

1275
01:14:14,682 --> 01:14:17,194
<i>He's the son of God,
and I think that's cool</i>

1276
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:20,096
<i>But he's got a swimmer's bod
like nobody do</i>

1277
01:14:20,221 --> 01:14:22,166
Blasphemy!
Go back to your seat.

1278
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,533
<i>Rock me, rock me, rock me, sexy Jesus</i>

1279

<i>Rock me, rock me, rock me, sexy Jesus</i>

1281
01:14:29,497 --> 01:14:32,275

<i>Immaculate conception
really makes my day</i>

1283
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:38,181
<i>But the dude's got lats
that make me feel gay</i>

1284
01:14:38,306 --> 01:14:41,085
<i>"Turn the other cheek"
is really showing class</i>

1285
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:44,087
<i>But I really think it's sexy
when he kicks Satan's ass</i>

1286
01:14:44,212 --> 01:14:45,555
<i>Kicks Satan's ass!</i>

1287
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:48,059
<i>Kicks Satan's ass!</i>

1288
01:14:48,184 --> 01:14:49,193
<i>Rock me, rock me, rock me, sexy Jesus</i>

1289
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,161
That's the crane.

01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:53,130
<i>He died for our sins

<i>Rock me, rock me, rock me, sexy Jesus</i>

1292
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:58,101
Wait, I totally get it.

1293
01:14:58,226 --> 01:15:00,426
Jesus kicks the devil's ass.

1294
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:03,506
But it's still disrespectful.

1295
01:15:03,631 --> 01:15:05,492
<i>You got to believe us</i>

1296
01:15:05,617 --> 01:15:07,478

<i>We're really amazed

1306
01:16:06,761 --> 01:16:09,239
<i>His moralistic ways Totally ease us</i>

1307
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:12,542
<i>His zen zing zang is gonna appease us</i>

01:16:12,667 --> 01:16:15,546

But it's supposed to
be intermission now.

1320
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:48,578
We can't have intermission.

1321
01:16:48,703 --> 01:16:50,346
The fire department is trying
to evacuate the building.

1322
01:16:50,471 --> 01:16:52,506
Everyone, keep going!

1323
01:16:57,378 --> 01:17:00,256
<i>When I think
of those East End lights</i>

01:17:08,623 --> 01:17:10,516
Coming.

You ready?
Yeah.

01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:15,105
Where are we going?

1331
01:17:16,364 --> 01:17:17,740
Got it!

1332
01:17:17,865 --> 01:17:20,478
Hold on!
Okay.

1333
01:17:20,603 --> 01:17:27,484
<i>And it's one more beer

<i>My friends out there

You know, Hamlet,
you must forgive your father

1337
01:17:42,690 --> 01:17:45,368
the abuse you suffered.

1338
01:17:45,493 --> 01:17:49,340
You know, sometimes even I feel
like my father's forsaken me.

1339
01:17:49,465 --> 01:17:50,507
Really?

1340
01:17:50,632 --> 01:17:51,609
Good luck.

1341
01:17:51,734 --> 01:17:53,409
Thanks, Jesus.

1342
01:17:53,534 --> 01:17:55,145
You got my cell number?
Yeah.

1343
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:57,314
Okay.

1344
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:01,284
My dad finds out what I've been up to,
he's gonna crucify me.

Laertes, therein lies the rub.

1350
01:18:18,594 --> 01:18:21,238
If we use my time machine, then
we could save thy sister, thy father,

1351
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:22,739
my dear mother, Queen Gertrude.

1352
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:24,274
Not to mention the King.

1353
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:27,478
Your madness must not unwatched go.

1354
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:34,373
That is excellent wire-work!

You watch it, Nacho Bell Grande!

01:21:08,162 --> 01:21:11,975
<i>Someone saved my life tonight</i>

1396
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:15,645
<i>Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight</i>

1397
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:19,515
<i>Someone saved my life tonight</i>

1398
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:23,609
<i>Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight</i>

1399
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:26,979
<i>I'm sorry, son.</i>

1400
01:21:29,117 --> 01:21:31,083
I forgive you, Father!

1401
01:21:37,192 --> 01:21:39,536
I was molested as a child.

1402
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:41,694
Maybe that's why I'm so angry.

1403
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:51,381
I forgive you.
Father, I forgive you.

1404
01:21:51,506 --> 01:21:54,940
I forgive you.
I forgive you.

1405
01:22:08,823 --> 01:22:09,956
I forgive you.

1406
01:22:11,926 --> 01:22:12,993
Wow.

1407
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:36,283
What's going on?

1408
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:40,663
Wow, there's a great energy in here.

1409
01:22:43,658 --> 01:22:45,591
I'm suing everybody!

1410
01:22:50,998 --> 01:22:52,542
This isn't over.

1411
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:53,543
I want you out of this community.

1412
01:22:53,668 --> 01:22:54,978
This play's offensive!

1413
01:22:55,103 --> 01:22:56,703
Well, I'm sorry!

1414
01:22:59,073 --> 01:22:59,983
No, no, no, don't do that!

1415
01:23:00,108 --> 01:23:01,307
That's offensive, too!

1416
01:23:06,948 --> 01:23:08,280
Jack Wiggum, please.

1417
01:23:09,685 --> 01:23:13,286
Jack, it's Elisabeth.
I'm ready to act again.

1418
01:23:14,655 --> 01:23:17,600
Shue. It's Elisabeth Shue.

1419
01:23:17,725 --> 01:23:19,636
Mr. Marschza?
It's Marschz.

1420
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:20,970
My name is Ron Kantor.

1421
01:23:21,095 --> 01:23:22,238
I'm with the <i>New York Times.</i>

1422
01:23:22,363 --> 01:23:24,875
I was quite taken with your play.

1423
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,476
Thank you.

1424
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:30,270
I was very moved when
Hamlet forgave his father.

1425
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:32,338
Great!

1426
01:23:34,909 --> 01:23:36,876
What about when I forgave my father?

1427
01:23:47,255 --> 01:23:49,533
A penny for your thoughts.

1428
01:23:49,658 --> 01:23:52,802
I was just thinking about all those
voices saying, "You can't do it,"

1429
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:54,971
and, "You're a loser."

1430
01:23:55,096 --> 01:23:56,239
Well, that's psychosis.

1431
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:58,490
You know, I had a feeling...

1432
01:23:58,615 --> 01:24:00,743
No, I mean actual voices,
like my ex-wife, the school,

1433
01:24:00,868 --> 01:24:02,546
pretty much everyone.

1434
01:24:02,671 --> 01:24:03,846
Well, everyone and their brother

1435
01:24:03,971 --> 01:24:05,983
wants a piece of your genius ass now.

1436
01:24:06,108 --> 01:24:08,819
Is it true that Jeremy effing
Irons wanted to do your play

1437
01:24:08,944 --> 01:24:11,688
and you turned him down?

1438
01:24:11,813 --> 01:24:16,059
"Dana, for
fuck's sake, please let me do your play."

1439
01:24:16,184 --> 01:24:18,828
It takes a real set
of low-hangers, mister.

1440
01:24:18,953 --> 01:24:21,698
He won't even let me be in it,
and I'm his girlfriend.

1441
01:24:21,823 --> 01:24:24,167
I wanna preserve the original cast.

1442
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:26,970
Artistic integrity!

1443
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:28,771
And, yes, he does have
a real set of low-hangers.

1444
01:24:28,896 --> 01:24:30,863
How romantic.

1445
01:24:34,301 --> 01:24:36,313
Well, this play
is gonna bitch-slap Broadway

1446
01:24:36,438 --> 01:24:39,082
like a cheap hooker at a gang-bang.

1447
01:24:39,207 --> 01:24:40,850
Yeah.

1448
01:24:40,975 --> 01:24:42,252
You know, and those
Bible-humping protesters

1449
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:43,654
can suck a bag of dicks,

1450
01:24:43,779 --> 01:24:44,954
'cause all they ended up doing

1451
01:24:45,079 --> 01:24:46,789
was giving you free publicity.

1452
01:24:46,914 --> 01:24:48,448
Yeah, and did you see
my dressing room?

1453
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:50,961
It has a bidet.

1454
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:52,229
That was a sink.

1455
01:24:52,354 --> 01:24:53,787
It was?

1456
01:24:54,689 --> 01:24:56,065
Hey, it's Mr. M.
Hi!

1457
01:24:56,190 --> 01:24:57,134
Hey.
Hi.

1458
01:24:57,259 --> 01:24:59,826
Hey, Mr. M.
New York's pretty cool.

1459
01:25:00,695 --> 01:25:01,927
Compared to Tucson.

1460
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:07,176
You know, Chuy,
you're gonna have a magical life.

1461
01:25:07,301 --> 01:25:09,746
Because no matter where you go,

1462
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:12,171
it will always be better than Tucson.

1463
01:25:17,746 --> 01:25:18,744
Come on.
