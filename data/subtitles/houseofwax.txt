1
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,693
You are being such a good boy.

2
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:58,891
Would you like some more cereal,
sweetheart? Here you go.

3
00:02:00,303 --> 00:02:02,737
He's really being a monster again today.

4
00:02:04,107 --> 00:02:05,836
Trudy, goddamn it, help me.

5
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,567
Can't you be more careful?

6
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:12,272
I'm doing the best I can.
He's out of control.

7
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:16,147
Sit still. Stop it!

8
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,843
Please hold him.

9
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:20,854
Don't do that. Stop kicking!

10
00:02:21,024 --> 00:02:23,390
Why can't you be
more like your brother?

11
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:28,797
Be quiet!

12
00:02:29,265 --> 00:02:31,460
Shut up!

13
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:31,686
There's a place in Tribeca for 3000.

14
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:36,423
That's too expensive. The money I saved up
won't cover two months' rent.

15
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm gonna have to work every second
I'm not in class until graduation.

16
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:43,400
- Carly, don't even think about not going.
- I'm not.

17
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:45,700
Good. Because you know
how proud I am of you.

18
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,435
- It's just an internship.
- At <i>InStyle</i> magazine.

19
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:52,047
Or would you rather stay
at the Waffle House as a waitress forever?

20
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:54,615
- No, thanks.
- Yeah.

21
00:03:56,452 --> 00:03:57,714
- Hey, babe.
- Hi.

22
00:03:57,887 --> 00:04:01,118
Sorry, there were these two drunk rednecks
wrestling in the bathroom.

23
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:04,226
- Really?
- There's no rednecks in New York.

24
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:06,889
No. There's not.

25
00:04:09,532 --> 00:04:11,124
I'm gonna go see
what Blake's doing.

26
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:14,065
He seems to like that car
more than me nowadays.

27
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:22,643
Now that we have a second... And
I'm not trying to make this a big deal.

28
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:26,009
You know I want to have a good time
on our road trip this weekend.

29
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,742
But why on earth did your brother
have to come with us?

30
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:31,614
You said your parents weren't
gonna post his bail anymore.

31
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:34,916
They didn't. Blake did. He invited him.

32
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:37,992
I guess Nick makes him feel more badass,
I don't know.

33
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,231
- Blake.
- What up, Paige?

34
00:04:47,403 --> 00:04:48,802
Blake.

35
00:04:57,613 --> 00:04:58,910
Fine.

36
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,744
Baby, come back here.

37
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:03,385
You know it ain't like that.

38
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,147
I was messing with the GPS,
and I saw a shortcut.

39
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:08,119
I think it'll save us an hour.

40
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,725
So we can spend more time...

41
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,057
okay?

42
00:05:19,268 --> 00:05:21,600
How you doing? Hello.

43
00:05:23,172 --> 00:05:24,639
- What's up, crow man?
- Get a job.

44
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:26,707
That's nice. Yeah.

45
00:05:26,943 --> 00:05:28,672
Here you go.

46
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:36,808
So, what do you think, guys?
Gonna be a sweet game tomorrow, huh?

47
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,619
Yeah.

48
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,222
- Dalton, please don't film me.
- What?

49
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:46,294
- I'm not filming now.
- The red light's on.

50
00:05:46,462 --> 00:05:49,795
Put the camera down. She doesn't like
having people up in her face.

51
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:52,799
- She folds under pressure.
- You got something to say to me?

52
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:56,496
No, I think you've already spoken enough
for the both of us, don't you?

53
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,911
You guys are lame. I'm out of here.
See you.

54
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:21,059
Dalton, put down that damn camera.

55
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,822
God.

56
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,874
<i>Record crowds are expected for college</i>
<i>football's biggest game of the year... </i>

57
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,247
- <i>... as Louisiana and Florida... </i>
- It's gonna be packed tomorrow.

58
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,116
Speaking of packed,
my legs are killing me back here, man.

59
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,488
Don't worry, man, it's not Wade's fault
his little Hot Wheels car only fits two.

60
00:06:52,128 --> 00:06:54,392
It's more like a "shot wheels" car,
isn't it?

61
00:06:54,564 --> 00:06:58,022
What did you do, go to the barber shop
and ask for a He-Man haircut?

62
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,027
Shut up, Dalton.

63
00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:04,804
Dude.

64
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,403
You hurt me.

65
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:13,006
- What the hell is this?
- Oh, man.

66
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:17,217
- This sucks.
- So much for his nice little shortcut.

67
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,222
I hope he's not gonna get us lost.

68
00:07:29,398 --> 00:07:31,730
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah.

69
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,532
Damn! Yo, yo, wake up. Wake up.

70
00:07:39,175 --> 00:07:40,665
Oh, my God.

71
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:42,910
Look at her. Look at her!

72
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,546
- You're caught on tape.
- Hello!

73
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,376
Oh, my God!
What are they doing?

74
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,145
- Is she flossing herself with that thing?
- What are you doing?

75
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,117
- Look at his face.
- She's calling me.

76
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:55,382
- He's blushing.
- You are so busted.

77
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,925
- Lip balm. I dropped my stupid lip balm.
- She dropped her lip balm.

78
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:00,494
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right.

79
00:08:00,663 --> 00:08:02,858
You dropped your lip balm.

80
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,860
- So, what's up?
- It's getting late.

81
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:08,936
- What do you wanna do?
- Keep going, we don't even have tickets.

82
00:08:09,105 --> 00:08:11,073
There's gonna be
a million scalpers there.

83
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,936
If we keep driving, there's no way
I'll stay up for the game.

84
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,408
Why don't we just camp out?
We're close enough.

85
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,605
Yeah, let's just pull over here. Come on.
We'll wake up early.

86
00:08:19,782 --> 00:08:22,012
- Yeah, all right.
- <i>All right, we're pulling over. </i>

87
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:23,652
All right.

88
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:30,884
Hey, wax museum.

89
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:39,566
- You like that kind of stuff, Wade?
- Yeah, I don't know. Sometimes.

90
00:08:39,735 --> 00:08:43,262
I guess if you like things pretending
to be other things.

91
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,737
Which you obviously do. Right, sis?

92
00:08:56,719 --> 00:09:00,587
- Where are we going, Blake?
- I'm just looking for some privacy.

93
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,497
We made it.

94
00:09:13,836 --> 00:09:15,428
Nice.

95
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:18,005
- You like it, right?
- This is great.

96
00:09:18,608 --> 00:09:21,008
Your car sucks, dude.

97
00:09:21,177 --> 00:09:23,975
- Paige, come with me.
- Wade, you gotta get a bigger car.

98
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,340
- Well?
- I couldn't.

99
00:09:25,514 --> 00:09:27,641
There's no point
in freaking him out right now.

100
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,115
As opposed to when you find out
you are pregnant?

101
00:09:30,286 --> 00:09:31,981
Carly, I'm not sure, okay?

102
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,384
I think you should
have a conversation with him.

103
00:09:34,557 --> 00:09:37,025
He's been looking forward
to this game for months.

104
00:09:37,193 --> 00:09:39,184
I don't wanna ruin it
by starting a fight.

105
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:42,126
Paige, he's not gonna marry you.
His parents won't let him.

106
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:45,597
Who says I want to get married?
Besides, I've been late before.

107
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:48,601
When I know for sure,
I promise to talk to him, okay?

108
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:51,095
Let's go.

109
00:09:56,445 --> 00:09:58,037
There are ticks out here.

110
00:10:02,218 --> 00:10:04,448
Yeah, don't help us or nothing.

111
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:08,189
- Let's set up.
- Oh, yeah.

112
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:13,792
Pass it! Pass it!

113
00:10:16,065 --> 00:10:18,056
You don't wanna...
Too slow, too slow!

114
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:20,498
- Blake.
- Come on.

115
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,160
Touchdown!

116
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:45,453
Nice arm.

117
00:10:46,262 --> 00:10:48,423
I see why they gave you a scholarship.

118
00:10:48,597 --> 00:10:50,758
Yeah, it's a real tragedy, ain't it?

119
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,100
Yeah, it is.

120
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:57,130
Wade. Help Dalton, okay?

121
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,870
Please?

122
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,407
- Bye, Wade.
- Asshole.

123
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:05,705
You can be a prick to me, that's fine.
But he didn't do anything to you.

124
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:08,042
So you admit that you did something.

125
00:11:08,217 --> 00:11:11,084
I admit, according to you,
I did something, sure.

126
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:13,847
- You dimed me out.
- I did not dime you out.

127
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:16,890
When the sheriffs asked where
you got the car, I said I didn't know.

128
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:19,823
I didn't even know it was stolen.
You're blaming that on me?

129
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:22,520
You could have covered for me, huh?

130
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:24,495
You get caught stealing,
it's my fault.

131
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:27,192
You're resisting arrest,
and it's the cop's fault.

132
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:28,631
He took a swing at me.

133
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:31,665
Get kicked off the football team,
it's the coach's fault.

134
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:34,435
Mom and Dad kick you out of the house,
it's their fault.

135
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,738
You can't keep a job for two weeks,
it's every manager's fault.

136
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:40,143
I'm surrounded by idiots.

137
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,607
So why did you come?
To piss me off?

138
00:11:44,653 --> 00:11:46,280
Don't you get it?

139
00:11:47,923 --> 00:11:50,016
You're the good twin.

140
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:53,825
I'm the evil one.

141
00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:58,126
Grow up. You are so afraid
to take things seriously.

142
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:03,363
Yeah. As afraid as Wade is of leaving
good old Gainesville?

143
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:09,068
New York City. Well, I hear
they got buildings as tall as the sky.

144
00:12:10,846 --> 00:12:12,711
Okay.

145
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:24,655
Blue 42! Hut! Go, go!

146
00:12:25,194 --> 00:12:28,527
- What's that smell?
- That's bad.

147
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:32,893
- Oh, my God.
- Dalton, did you crap your pants again?

148
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:36,200
No. I don't know. Maybe.

149
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:38,636
I mean, I'm wearing
my work clothes, so...

150
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,341
It's horrible.

151
00:12:49,885 --> 00:12:53,514
- Something's dead out there.
- No, something's dead right here.

152
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:57,225
We need to drink it back to life.
Bless me, dog.

153
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:02,060
Come on, man.

154
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:03,926
Hi, pretty Carly.

155
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:07,166
Hey, what's Wade short for, dude?

156
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,567
Who?

157
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,167
- What up, Nick?
- Stop.

158
00:13:13,342 --> 00:13:15,003
- You gonna do it tonight?
- Screw off.

159
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:18,169
- Stop.
- What? Come on, you know you want it.

160
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:21,306
Come on, man.
You don't gotta spray it at me, dude.

161
00:13:22,184 --> 00:13:24,015
- Look at that.
- Keeps messing around.

162
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:26,051
God, dude.

163
00:13:34,864 --> 00:13:38,095
- Dalton, what did I say?
- All right, my bad, my bad. Sorry.

164
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,161
- What? No, it's off...
- You're killing me with this thing.

165
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:44,602
- Give me that... oh, and the tables turn.
- No, no, no. Come on. Don't...

166
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:47,333
Look how cute you are on camera,
though. You look good.

167
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,944
I think we might have to do
a little makeover.

168
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:52,447
- What do you think?
- He looks like a Smurf.

169
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:56,983
So why'd you steal that car anyway?
I mean, you didn't need to do that.

170
00:13:57,152 --> 00:13:59,211
Get that rush, huh?

171
00:14:00,723 --> 00:14:02,054
Something like that.

172
00:14:02,224 --> 00:14:03,748
- You're coming out.
- I don't know.

173
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,622
If you don't, I will be so mad.

174
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,654
Damn, Paige.

175
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:11,299
- Look how good you look.
- Hey.

176
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:14,100
He looks like Elton John, but more gay.

177
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,262
- Elton John is gay?
- You look hot.

178
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,100
- Yellow is his color.
- It's in style.

179
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,176
Why don't you ever make me
that pretty, Carly?

180
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:28,483
- Hi.
- Hi.

181
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:32,478
Give me my camera. Come on, now.

182
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,748
Oh, yeah, that's good. Let me get
some of that action.

183
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,424
That's hot.

184
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:46,933
Don't even think about it.
I ain't kissing you, dude.

185
00:14:47,102 --> 00:14:49,866
Come on, you know you want to, dude.

186
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:53,736
Just kidding. Psyche.
I wouldn't kiss your ass for shit.

187
00:15:06,121 --> 00:15:07,748
Yeah?

188
00:15:08,057 --> 00:15:11,993
- Hey, yo, man, you need something?
- What does he want?

189
00:15:12,461 --> 00:15:14,986
Hey, can you turn off
your lights, please?

190
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:23,497
Okay, this is getting kind of creepy.

191
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,573
Hey, come on, man, get out of here.
Nothing to see here. Let's go.

192
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:31,546
- Can we help you?
- Maybe we're on his property.

193
00:15:31,714 --> 00:15:35,013
- No, we didn't pass a gate.
- Hey, man, turn your lights off.

194
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,585
- Hello!
- Turn your lights off.

195
00:15:39,421 --> 00:15:41,480
Turn them off,
or I'm whupping someone's ass.

196
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,180
It's cool, man.

197
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:49,562
Nick!

198
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:53,124
Oh, my...

199
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:04,678
What?

200
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:15,687
Yeah!

201
00:16:20,262 --> 00:16:23,026
That was great. That was great, dude.

202
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:25,166
My man Nick here's hardcore.

203
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:27,495
What the hell was that about, huh?

204
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:31,128
- You the man, dude. That was awesome.
- Don't encourage him.

205
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:36,072
Come on, he's gone.

206
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,339
Wade. Wade.

207
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:51,075
Wade.

208
00:17:51,553 --> 00:17:52,781
I heard something.

209
00:17:55,557 --> 00:17:58,788
It's probably a serial killer
or something.

210
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,693
What are you doing?

211
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:11,594
You scared me.

212
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:13,495
What are you doing?

213
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:17,903
Getting you back to bed.
Come on. Let's go to sleep.

214
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,008
- I heard something.
- Get in that tent.

215
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:31,076
Damn it. Hey, it's 2:30! Get up!

216
00:19:33,822 --> 00:19:37,258
Let's go, guys. Get up. Get up!

217
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:41,926
Wade, Dalton, let's go.
We're gonna miss the damn game.

218
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,622
Nick. Get up!

219
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,694
Damn.

220
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:53,974
- Dude, you see my camera anywhere?
- No, man.

221
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,072
- You guys seen my camera?
- Like I give a shit about it.

222
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:03,108
- So you and Wade talk some more?
- We're just in different places right now.

223
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:07,153
He hasn't given me a guilt trip for going,
so I can't give him one for staying.

224
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:12,090
Oh, my God, there's that smell again.

225
00:20:12,828 --> 00:20:17,458
- I think it's coming from over there.
- Yeah, let's go follow the smell.

226
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,157
What? I wanna see what it is.

227
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:21,666
- Why?
- Come on.

228
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:26,999
What the hell was that?

229
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,440
No way.

230
00:20:35,017 --> 00:20:38,612
Are you serious? It was brand-new.

231
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,986
Someone's fucking with me.

232
00:20:42,257 --> 00:20:44,953
I cannot believe
you're making me do this.

233
00:20:45,127 --> 00:20:46,526
Only you.

234
00:20:46,962 --> 00:20:49,522
- Come on, it'll be fine.
- I'm gonna throw up.

235
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:52,691
Oh, my God. I hate you.

236
00:20:55,971 --> 00:20:57,336
Carly!

237
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,539
- Carly!
- Paige!

238
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:09,741
- Are you okay?
- I'm stuck!

239
00:21:09,918 --> 00:21:13,479
Wade! Please help me
get out of here!

240
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:15,213
We're down here!

241
00:21:15,824 --> 00:21:17,519
Guys, help us!

242
00:21:23,265 --> 00:21:25,995
- Guys! Get down here!
- Carly! Carly!

243
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:27,927
- Hey! Hey!
- I can't get out.

244
00:21:28,103 --> 00:21:31,266
- I'm here, hold on! Hold on, baby.
- Wade, where are you?

245
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,874
- Carly. I'm right here.
- Carly!

246
00:21:34,776 --> 00:21:39,008
Here. Grab me, baby. Come on.
Come on. I got you. Get up here.

247
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,179
You all right? Oh, man.

248
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,682
There's a roadkill pit down here.

249
00:21:46,922 --> 00:21:49,720
- Yeah, that smells about right.
- Baby, you okay?

250
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,121
I got you.

251
00:21:53,962 --> 00:21:55,452
It's okay.

252
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,793
Hey, is that the truck from last night?

253
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:02,098
Not unless he fixed his headlight.

254
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,794
Hey!

255
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,591
Don't you see that?

256
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:37,266
What is that?

257
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,282
No way.

258
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,451
What are you doing, man?

259
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:07,165
Anyone need a hand?

260
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:10,835
I'm just fooling.

261
00:23:11,706 --> 00:23:13,037
It's not real, see?

262
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,299
God.

263
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,641
I found it on the side of the road
a few weeks ago.

264
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,079
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Sorry we took so long.

265
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,411
- It's all right.
- What are you guys doing here?

266
00:23:24,586 --> 00:23:27,680
We were all camping up
through those trees.

267
00:23:27,889 --> 00:23:30,824
- I have water in here somewhere. God.
- Oh, good.

268
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,619
You guys seen my camera?

269
00:23:32,894 --> 00:23:34,657
- Are you kidding?
- No.

270
00:23:35,297 --> 00:23:38,232
- Damn.
- Hey, is there a gas station around here?

271
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,233
- Well, I got some gas in the truck if...
- I need a fan belt.

272
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,037
What?

273
00:23:43,305 --> 00:23:46,399
- Just busted.
- Of course. Perfect.

274
00:23:46,741 --> 00:23:50,199
Bo might have one.
Runs a station in Ambrose.

275
00:23:50,445 --> 00:23:53,209
- Where's that?
- Fifteen miles up the road.

276
00:23:53,615 --> 00:23:57,915
- Let's just get one in Baton Rouge.
- Man, there's no way I'm leaving my car.

277
00:23:58,086 --> 00:24:01,988
- What if that guy from last night strips it?
- You're gonna miss the game, then.

278
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,319
Yeah, well, that's not why I came.

279
00:24:06,661 --> 00:24:09,152
All right, look.
I'll run you up to the station.

280
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:13,358
- Kickoff's in a couple hours.
- You're already late. You gotta snag tickets.

281
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,799
Y'all should just go now.
I'll stay with my car.

282
00:24:15,971 --> 00:24:18,030
It's fine. Get me a fan belt
on the way back.

283
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,798
- Make sure it's a 15-inch.
- Gotcha.

284
00:24:19,975 --> 00:24:21,943
I'll give you a ride.

285
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:27,073
- You serious?
- If you like.

286
00:24:28,617 --> 00:24:30,710
- Well, yeah. Yeah.
- That's cool?

287
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,786
Yeah, if it's cool.

288
00:24:33,188 --> 00:24:35,349
- I'm going with you.
- Carly, no.

289
00:24:35,524 --> 00:24:38,220
- Yes. It'll be fine.
- All right, let's go.

290
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,883
Come on, Paige.

291
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,892
- Carly.
- What?

292
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,261
I'll leave tickets at will call.

293
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:49,398
- Thank you.
- All right. All good, man.

294
00:24:49,704 --> 00:24:51,365
Come on, babe.

295
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,213
Oh, it's okay.

296
00:25:09,324 --> 00:25:11,815
Come on, baby.
So let's get out of here.

297
00:25:15,797 --> 00:25:18,391
Man, you're just gonna let them
leave like that?

298
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:21,001
With a guy who throws roadkill
in a pit for a living?

299
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:24,395
You clean shit for a living,
Mr. Septic-Tank-Man.

300
00:25:24,573 --> 00:25:26,006
What's the difference?

301
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:28,176
Well, I don't walk through it,
that's one.

302
00:25:28,743 --> 00:25:31,177
That's a difference, right?

303
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:18,251
- Can you roll the window down, please?
- Yeah.

304
00:26:19,794 --> 00:26:24,197
Sorry about that.
Truck's seen better days.

305
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:29,131
Do you mind rolling down
your window, then?

306
00:26:30,772 --> 00:26:32,000
Not at all.

307
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:40,843
Sorry. I kind of get used to the smell.

308
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,141
Really? I don't think
I could ever get used to it.

309
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:48,016
Well, you can get used to anything
if you're around it long enough.

310
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:52,419
If you get them in the early morning
before the sun bakes them up...

311
00:26:52,594 --> 00:26:53,822
...they're not so bad.

312
00:26:53,995 --> 00:26:56,828
If they're fresh, though,
I just take them home.

313
00:26:56,998 --> 00:26:58,829
Why waste the meat?

314
00:27:01,503 --> 00:27:05,303
- Are we almost there yet?
- It's just up the road.

315
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,835
Yep, Ambrose used to be
a pretty nice town...

316
00:27:09,644 --> 00:27:11,908
...before the interstate came in.

317
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,316
You like knives.

318
00:27:16,518 --> 00:27:18,918
- Not really.
- Tools of the trade. You wanna see it?

319
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:21,511
That's okay.

320
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:25,091
It's a bowie. It's a good knife.

321
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,955
That'll cut through anything.

322
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,567
What's going on?
You said there was a town up here.

323
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:40,466
Well, yeah, there is.
It's just around that bend.

324
00:27:40,642 --> 00:27:44,305
I gotta flip my hubs into four-wheel.
You mind giving me a hand?

325
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:46,970
When's the last time
that you were here?

326
00:27:48,783 --> 00:27:50,808
What, you don't believe me?

327
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:54,350
I forgot this way in's washed out,
that's all.

328
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,022
We'll walk the rest of the way.
You've done enough.

329
00:27:58,193 --> 00:27:59,922
Now, why would you want to do that?

330
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:02,922
Look, we wanna walk, okay?
Just let us out now.

331
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:07,991
Sure.

332
00:28:26,421 --> 00:28:27,649
Well, get out, then.

333
00:28:29,758 --> 00:28:31,692
Try and do something nice
for someone...

334
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,694
- Look, it's not like that. We appreciate it.
- Yeah, I can tell.

335
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,275
Is he still staring?

336
00:28:56,451 --> 00:28:59,477
- Yeah. Just keep walking.
- Oh, like I'm gonna stop.

337
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,587
Damn.

338
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:08,456
- Now I feel like a real asshole.
- I don't care. That guy was a freak.

339
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,669
Dude, it's over.

340
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,609
It'll move.

341
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,119
It's not moving.

342
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:34,812
- We'll make the second half.
- I'm not sitting in this.

343
00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:37,480
- What do you want me to do?
- We have to go back.

344
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:39,524
- Turn around.
- I'm not missing this game.

345
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:42,458
- Turn the car around, okay?
- They're waiting for us already.

346
00:29:43,765 --> 00:29:46,632
Slow down, speedy. God.

347
00:29:49,904 --> 00:29:51,496
Miss Ambrose.

348
00:29:51,806 --> 00:29:54,969
Wonder how many teeth
you have to have to win that one.

349
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,608
- This is kind of nice.
- Yeah.

350
00:30:00,782 --> 00:30:02,647
Oh, wait. Babe, there's a pet store.

351
00:30:02,817 --> 00:30:04,682
- Oh, great.
- Come on.

352
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:08,787
Are those puppies? Oh, my God.
Look at them.

353
00:30:08,957 --> 00:30:11,551
They're cute. Adorable.
Maybe next time. Come on.

354
00:30:11,993 --> 00:30:13,551
Come on.

355
00:30:24,772 --> 00:30:26,399
Hello?

356
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,713
Hello?

357
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:38,483
- You see anybody?
- No, nobody.

358
00:30:41,689 --> 00:30:44,055
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, it's me. We're heading back. </i>

359
00:30:44,225 --> 00:30:45,556
Really? Why? What happened?

360
00:30:45,727 --> 00:30:48,821
<i>Traffic. Did you get that fan belt</i>
<i>thing or whatever?</i>

361
00:30:48,997 --> 00:30:52,956
No. There's no one at the gas station.
I don't know where we're going right now.

362
00:30:53,134 --> 00:30:54,931
<i>So where do you want us to pick you up?</i>

363
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,970
Just head up the road that we got off at
for the campsite.

364
00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:00,801
It's washed out at the end.
Call us when you get there.

365
00:31:00,975 --> 00:31:02,169
<i>Continuing coverage... </i>

366
00:31:02,343 --> 00:31:07,144
<i>We'll camp in the same place as yesterday,</i>
<i>but away from that pet cemetery. </i>

367
00:31:07,315 --> 00:31:08,873
Cool. See you then.

368
00:31:10,852 --> 00:31:14,288
- There's that house of wax.
- Wade, what about the fan belt?

369
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,821
Well, there's no one at the station.

370
00:31:17,158 --> 00:31:20,855
- Why don't we ask someone in the church.
- All right. All right.

371
00:31:27,201 --> 00:31:32,969
Let us all bow our heads and say a prayer
for our beloved deceased friend.

372
00:31:39,714 --> 00:31:41,113
- We should go.
- Yeah.

373
00:31:41,282 --> 00:31:42,510
<i>Sorry. </i>

374
00:31:47,789 --> 00:31:50,815
- What do we do, just wait out here?
- I don't know.

375
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:55,258
I feel kind of messed up waiting outside
a church for a funeral to end.

376
00:31:56,798 --> 00:31:59,062
Hey, man, sorry about walking in.
We didn't know...

377
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:00,996
You shouldn't have walked in.

378
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,866
Yeah, I know. It's just that we have
car trouble. We're not from this town.

379
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,633
We were looking for Bo.
He works at the gas station.

380
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:09,140
You found him.

381
00:32:09,444 --> 00:32:13,847
Really? Well, we need a fan belt.

382
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,142
- We were camping up the road and...
- A fan belt?

383
00:32:16,317 --> 00:32:17,306
Yeah.

384
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:20,921
You walk in on a funeral
for a fucking fan belt?

385
00:32:22,557 --> 00:32:26,152
Well, let me just go dump the casket
in the ground. I'll be right there.

386
00:32:26,327 --> 00:32:29,228
- Look, we're sorry.
- Yeah.

387
00:32:38,106 --> 00:32:40,574
That's twice today. I'm an asshole.

388
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,905
- Let's just go back to the road.
- Hey.

389
00:32:47,582 --> 00:32:51,109
Hey, I'm sorry. You know,
someone very special to me passed.

390
00:32:51,285 --> 00:32:55,449
- And I didn't mean to take it out on you.
- No, no, no. It's totally understandable.

391
00:32:57,258 --> 00:32:58,885
I reckon things will wrap up soon.

392
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,188
Why don't I meet you guys back
at the station in about a half?

393
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:05,298
- That'd be great, if that's okay.
- Yeah.

394
00:33:11,973 --> 00:33:13,463
Great.

395
00:33:15,977 --> 00:33:17,308
What?

396
00:33:18,546 --> 00:33:23,006
Nothing. Looks like your fan club's
gotten a little bigger.

397
00:33:23,718 --> 00:33:26,414
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. I am serious.

398
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,680
It's obvious Dalton
still has a crush on you.

399
00:33:28,856 --> 00:33:30,687
Oh, my God.

400
00:33:30,858 --> 00:33:34,692
Okay, that's three times today.
You're an asshole.

401
00:33:34,862 --> 00:33:37,330
Let's go see your famous house of wax.

402
00:33:39,701 --> 00:33:41,692
But I'm still your favorite asshole,
right?

403
00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:43,666
Always.

404
00:34:33,187 --> 00:34:36,054
I don't know what you expect
to see in here.

405
00:34:47,702 --> 00:34:50,500
It is wax. Like, literally.

406
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:59,071
- You're not gonna go in there, are you?
- Yeah.

407
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,786
Doesn't "closed" mean
"I don't want you in here"?

408
00:35:09,957 --> 00:35:12,016
Relax. I just wanna take a quick look.

409
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,727
- What if someone's here?
- Hello?

410
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:18,195
Anyone in here?

411
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,300
See? We're fine.

412
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:25,973
How cool is this? Everything in here
is wax. The floor, the walls.

413
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,007
- Look at this. This is wax.
- Yeah. Cool. Awesome.

414
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:37,775
- Who are these people supposed to be?
- I don't know.

415
00:35:37,952 --> 00:35:40,978
Aren't there supposed to be
famous people in a wax museum?

416
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:44,520
I don't recognize this guy.

417
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,320
"Trudy opens House of Wax. "

418
00:35:49,664 --> 00:35:53,430
"Trudy's wax carvings are a hit
at the state fair. "

419
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:57,496
"Trudy and husband
are expecting first child. "

420
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,364
Since when is a wax sculptor
a celebrity?

421
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:03,977
- I don't know. Small town, I guess.
- That's right. You like small towns.

422
00:36:04,145 --> 00:36:08,741
I didn't say I wasn't gonna like New York,
I just said I haven't made a decision yet.

423
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,781
I still have time, all right?

424
00:36:11,052 --> 00:36:13,543
Well, I'd really like you
to be there with me.

425
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:15,948
"Oh, no. There's a fire.
Help me, Carly.

426
00:36:16,123 --> 00:36:18,956
I'm melting. My skirt's gonna catch fire.
My legs are burned.

427
00:36:19,126 --> 00:36:21,287
- Cut it out, please.
- You're my hero. "

428
00:36:21,462 --> 00:36:22,929
That's not cool.

429
00:36:24,065 --> 00:36:27,125
Hey, Car. There's a dog for you.

430
00:36:27,468 --> 00:36:30,631
Hey, puppy. You a little wax dog too?
What up, dog?

431
00:36:31,906 --> 00:36:33,134
Jesus!

432
00:36:37,678 --> 00:36:39,578
That is cool.

433
00:36:39,747 --> 00:36:41,612
Yeah, laugh it up.

434
00:36:42,183 --> 00:36:44,651
What's a dog doing in here anyway?

435
00:37:01,335 --> 00:37:02,802
"Vincent"?

436
00:37:07,575 --> 00:37:09,543
Another vincent.

437
00:37:14,081 --> 00:37:16,515
This vincent guy's quite the artist.

438
00:37:16,684 --> 00:37:19,812
Yeah, I think this vincent guy
needs therapy.

439
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:27,721
I mean, look how detailed this is.
Tell me this doesn't look real.

440
00:37:28,262 --> 00:37:29,490
I don't really care.

441
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,492
I mean, not that it's bad,
but everything made out of wax?

442
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,862
Don't you think that's a little weird?

443
00:37:38,472 --> 00:37:40,133
Those aren't wax.

444
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,071
Oh, whatever.

445
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,369
When do you think
the last person was here?

446
00:37:45,546 --> 00:37:47,104
A while, probably.

447
00:37:50,985 --> 00:37:53,317
- What? What is it?
- I just saw someone.

448
00:37:55,957 --> 00:37:57,982
- It was probably just a wax thing.
- No, no.

449
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:01,094
It wasn't a wax thing. It was moving
and it was freaky-looking.

450
00:38:01,262 --> 00:38:03,025
I'll go check it out.

451
00:38:03,331 --> 00:38:05,993
Wade, where are you going?
Don't leave me.

452
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:08,260
- Wade, come on.
- Hang here a second.

453
00:38:08,436 --> 00:38:10,597
No. Wait.

454
00:40:01,715 --> 00:40:03,808
- What's wrong?
- This place is freaking me out.

455
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,646
- Calm down. There's no one here.
- Please, I just wanna go.

456
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,619
Okay. Okay. We'll go
to the station, then.

457
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:14,222
Oh, dude, I had to pee so bad, man.

458
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,027
Come on, dude.

459
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:21,930
Hey, you guys gonna have sex?

460
00:40:22,103 --> 00:40:24,333
- What?
- Because me and Paige are.

461
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,405
- So you two go pick them up.
- All right.

462
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,474
- Hey, Paige.
- Yeah?

463
00:40:28,642 --> 00:40:31,236
- Nick and Dalton are gonna go get them.
- Why? We can go.

464
00:40:31,412 --> 00:40:35,371
- Oh, baby. Come on, I'm tired of driving.
- Okay.

465
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,516
Why don't you let my man drive.

466
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,085
Really?

467
00:40:41,255 --> 00:40:43,280
- You heard him. Move.
- Give me the damn keys.

468
00:40:43,457 --> 00:40:46,153
Okay. Very slow. Thank you.

469
00:40:47,128 --> 00:40:49,722
I don't think this is cool,
just coming in like this.

470
00:40:49,897 --> 00:40:52,024
What? Look, the door was unlocked.

471
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,724
He said he'd be half an hour,
he's been 45 minutes.

472
00:40:54,902 --> 00:40:56,267
I'm sure he won't mind.

473
00:40:56,437 --> 00:40:59,270
You know, if your brother and his yes man
hadn't come along...

474
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,273
...we would've fit with Blake.
None of this would've happened.

475
00:41:02,576 --> 00:41:04,601
Once again, that's not my fault.

476
00:41:04,778 --> 00:41:06,370
I don't understand
his beef with me.

477
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,516
- I've tried to be cool with him.
- Nick's got beef with everybody.

478
00:41:09,683 --> 00:41:12,311
- You just can't take it personally.
- Yeah, I guess.

479
00:41:12,486 --> 00:41:16,217
Nick and I always used to stick together,
and then when we were in junior high...

480
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:20,520
...and Nick would get into trouble here and
there and our parents would always, like...

481
00:41:20,694 --> 00:41:22,855
...compare us. I was the good twin...

482
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,794
...and Nick was the evil twin,
as he likes to say.

483
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,895
He kind of got this image.

484
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:32,129
He totally played it up as if
that's what he had to be or something.

485
00:41:34,642 --> 00:41:37,611
It's already getting dark.
I hate the winter.

486
00:41:37,778 --> 00:41:41,236
He's got everything but a 15-inch.

487
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,214
I'll just have to use a 16-inch.

488
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:47,611
- Make it work somehow.
- You plan on stealing that?

489
00:41:49,023 --> 00:41:51,548
No. We didn't know how much longer
you were gonna be...

490
00:41:51,725 --> 00:41:54,125
...and, you know, we didn't
wanna interrupt again.

491
00:41:54,295 --> 00:41:57,526
I left you money on the counter,
but you don't have the right size.

492
00:41:57,698 --> 00:42:00,258
- You don't have any 15-inches.
- I do at the house.

493
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:03,232
I hope you're not getting
the wrong idea that we're in here.

494
00:42:03,404 --> 00:42:04,962
No, it's okay.

495
00:42:07,074 --> 00:42:09,201
- Does that cover it?
- It's close enough.

496
00:42:09,376 --> 00:42:12,345
Why don't we get the one you need?
It's only a couple of blocks.

497
00:42:12,513 --> 00:42:14,981
- Yeah, all right.
- You keep fan belts at your house?

498
00:42:15,216 --> 00:42:17,343
I get things delivered there
when I'm not here.

499
00:42:17,518 --> 00:42:19,986
If you wanna hold on to the 16,
that's fine by me.

500
00:42:20,154 --> 00:42:22,179
No, no, no. It's okay.

501
00:42:24,692 --> 00:42:26,819
Hey, you mind if I use
your restroom real fast?

502
00:42:26,994 --> 00:42:29,019
Oh, up at the house.
That one's out of order.

503
00:42:29,196 --> 00:42:30,720
All right.

504
00:42:34,435 --> 00:42:38,098
So is it too late to sign Carly up
for that beauty pageant?

505
00:42:38,505 --> 00:42:42,464
Now, unfortunately it is, because
you would've won hands down.

506
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,905
- Thank you.
- That house of wax is pretty cool.

507
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:46,603
- You went inside?
- Yeah.

508
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,839
Yeah, it was unlocked,
so, you know...

509
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:52,478
Everything seems to be unlocked
around you, now don't it?

510
00:42:54,355 --> 00:42:57,153
Yeah, people used to come to see it
from miles away.

511
00:42:57,324 --> 00:43:01,226
And Trudy was the main...
I guess "artist" is the appropriate word.

512
00:43:01,395 --> 00:43:03,226
What about vincent?

513
00:43:03,964 --> 00:43:07,798
- I saw his name on a lot of the work.
- He was one of Trudy's boys.

514
00:43:07,968 --> 00:43:10,664
- They still around?
- No, no. It's a horrible story.

515
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,830
Trudy's husband, Doc Sinclair,
he was a doctor in the big city...

516
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:17,136
...until he got his license revoked
for doing surgeries on the side.

517
00:43:17,311 --> 00:43:20,041
Stuff that, you know,
most doctors wouldn't dare do.

518
00:43:20,214 --> 00:43:23,081
So he moved him and Trudy
out here to Ambrose...

519
00:43:23,417 --> 00:43:25,885
...made a fresh start
with his medical practice...

520
00:43:26,053 --> 00:43:30,183
...and, you know, Trudy really found her
calling with that whole wax-sculpture thing.

521
00:43:30,457 --> 00:43:33,551
It was her dream to do something
really incredible here.

522
00:43:33,727 --> 00:43:35,752
And then she had a couple kids,
picket fence.

523
00:43:35,929 --> 00:43:37,590
- What's horrible about that?
- Yeah.

524
00:43:37,765 --> 00:43:41,030
Trudy got a cyst in her brain.
She just started rotting away.

525
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,533
Couldn't work no more,
and she went crazy.

526
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:47,037
Things got so bad that Doc Sinclair
finally had to strap her to the bed.

527
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:49,573
The whole town
could hear her screaming.

528
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:53,241
Dr. Sinclair was so depressed
that he couldn't save her...

529
00:43:53,414 --> 00:43:56,076
...he blew his head right off.
- That's terrible.

530
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,445
It was worse for the boys,
left alone like that.

531
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:01,349
They both ended up in foster homes.

532
00:44:02,856 --> 00:44:04,255
Hey, why don't you two hop in.

533
00:44:04,425 --> 00:44:07,417
I'll go get the fan belt,
and I'll give you a ride to your car.

534
00:44:07,594 --> 00:44:11,030
No, actually, we've got friends picking
us up where the road's washed out.

535
00:44:11,198 --> 00:44:14,190
I'll give you a lift. Least I could do
for making y'all wait.

536
00:44:14,368 --> 00:44:15,699
- Cool.
- All right.

537
00:44:16,437 --> 00:44:20,305
- Hey, you need to use the facilities, right?
- Yeah. Thanks.

538
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:24,209
- Need to use the can?
- No, it's okay. I'm fine.

539
00:44:24,378 --> 00:44:26,175
All right.

540
00:44:36,056 --> 00:44:39,492
- So where you heading to anyway?
- We're just going to a football game.

541
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,653
The bathroom is right down the hall.

542
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:45,993
Let me get out of this jacket and tie,
and I'll grab your fan belt.

543
00:44:46,166 --> 00:44:47,793
Okay. Thanks.

544
00:45:20,868 --> 00:45:23,462
Just let me drive, bitch.
He gave me the keys, man.

545
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:26,936
Yeah, because he thinks I'm the one
who stole the car and crashed it.

546
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:29,702
Whatever. You didn't
have to cover for me, dude.

547
00:45:29,877 --> 00:45:33,313
Your jacket's clean, all right?
Mine's already got plenty of stains on it.

548
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,846
One more's not gonna make a difference.

549
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,948
Where the hell is this place?
Town's not even on the GPS.

550
00:45:43,123 --> 00:45:44,681
That's weird.

551
00:48:24,251 --> 00:48:25,548
Hello?

552
00:48:27,454 --> 00:48:29,251
Hello?

553
00:48:32,259 --> 00:48:34,124
Hello?

554
00:48:35,228 --> 00:48:37,025
I'm in here!

555
00:48:37,798 --> 00:48:39,823
Hello? I'm in here.

556
00:48:44,071 --> 00:48:45,368
Hey.

557
00:48:47,574 --> 00:48:49,235
Hello?

558
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,405
Hello.

559
00:49:51,638 --> 00:49:53,037
Come on.

560
00:50:06,353 --> 00:50:08,514
<i>Hey, it's Blake. </i>
<i>You know what to do. </i>

561
00:50:08,689 --> 00:50:10,657
Guys, where the hell are you?

562
00:50:10,824 --> 00:50:13,486
Remember the truck that came
to the campsite last night?

563
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:15,321
I think we just ran into him.

564
00:50:19,366 --> 00:50:22,927
- Where's Wade?
- Oh, he's not out here?

565
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:28,135
Guess he's still in the bathroom, then.
I got the fan belt.

566
00:50:28,575 --> 00:50:30,042
You're not in a hurry, are you?

567
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:33,771
Because I wanted to load
the truck up with some stuff first.

568
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:37,178
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for Wade.

569
00:50:41,488 --> 00:50:42,750
Open the damn door.

570
00:50:43,724 --> 00:50:45,715
This is my truck.

571
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:47,650
Hey, what is the matter with you?

572
00:50:47,828 --> 00:50:50,296
If you don't open this door,
I'm gonna call the cops.

573
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,659
You're the guy from the campsite.

574
00:50:58,038 --> 00:50:59,300
Wade!

575
00:51:00,207 --> 00:51:01,435
- What are you doing?
- Wade!

576
00:51:01,608 --> 00:51:04,008
Get out of the truck. Stop it.

577
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:07,641
I'm just trying to help you.
Give me the keys. Hey. Hey.

578
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:10,146
Stop it, or I'm calling the cops.

579
00:52:20,487 --> 00:52:22,114
So...

580
00:52:22,289 --> 00:52:24,780
...you think Carly and Wade
are gonna stay together...

581
00:52:24,958 --> 00:52:26,516
...when she moves to New York?

582
00:52:26,693 --> 00:52:29,025
Because she be looking
at me sometimes like...

583
00:52:29,196 --> 00:52:31,687
- Dalton, it ain't happening.
- What? What do you mean?

584
00:52:31,865 --> 00:52:34,026
And even if it was happening...

585
00:52:34,201 --> 00:52:36,567
...it ain't happening. Nothing personal.

586
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:39,398
Why? You like me better
than Wade, right?

587
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,473
Wade's not so bad.

588
00:52:44,177 --> 00:52:46,145
Yeah, I like Wade too.

1
00:02:45,842 --> 00:02:48,709
Help. Please, somebody.

2
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:50,140
Please.

3
00:02:50,813 --> 00:02:52,280
Please help me.

4
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:54,243
No.

5
00:03:22,712 --> 00:03:24,976
What? What?

6
00:04:27,944 --> 00:04:32,244
I'm sorry, Mama.
These people just have no respect.

7
00:05:47,655 --> 00:05:50,089
Help! Help, please!

8
00:05:50,258 --> 00:05:52,226
Will you help, please?! Over here!

9
00:05:53,428 --> 00:05:55,658
Help me!

10
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,662
What are you gonna do to me?

11
00:06:10,278 --> 00:06:13,145
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

12
00:06:13,781 --> 00:06:16,113
Well, should we drive through it,
you think?

13
00:06:16,451 --> 00:06:19,443
- Through all that?
- I don't know. I could do it.

14
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,588
That's what I thought.

15
00:06:31,065 --> 00:06:34,466
Put me down! No.

16
00:06:35,636 --> 00:06:37,126
No.

17
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,953
Let me go!

18
00:07:11,739 --> 00:07:13,104
Please.

19
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:26,377
Hello?

20
00:07:29,457 --> 00:07:31,516
Carly? Wade? Hello?

21
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:33,417
Dalton!

22
00:07:36,631 --> 00:07:38,189
All right. Listen.

23
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:42,302
One word, and this is going
through your throat. Yeah?

24
00:07:45,273 --> 00:07:48,242
Man, there's music playing,
but I don't think anyone's here.

25
00:07:48,743 --> 00:07:50,677
No one's here.

26
00:07:52,113 --> 00:07:53,740
Where you going?

27
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:57,212
To that grocery store we passed.
I'm thirsty.

28
00:07:57,385 --> 00:07:59,785
Well, what about your sister
and Wade, man?

29
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:02,351
Maybe they're at the store.

30
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:05,624
What?

31
00:08:06,294 --> 00:08:07,886
I don't know.
We came all this way.

32
00:08:08,062 --> 00:08:11,520
- You don't think we should look for them?
- Check it. I'm gonna go this way.

33
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,793
Go that way. We don't find them,
meet here, go back to the road.

34
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:17,335
- Cool?
- Okay.

35
00:08:30,017 --> 00:08:32,747
Yo, paying customer.

36
00:08:34,355 --> 00:08:35,822
Hello?

37
00:08:56,243 --> 00:08:58,211
- Don't move.
- Now what are you do...?

38
00:08:58,613 --> 00:09:00,205
It's okay.

39
00:09:03,484 --> 00:09:05,213
Just stay still.

40
00:09:07,822 --> 00:09:10,586
It's a shame we have to close
that pretty mouth of yours.

41
00:09:12,994 --> 00:09:15,724
Especially with the way
those lips curve.

42
00:10:07,214 --> 00:10:08,909
Hey.

43
00:10:09,283 --> 00:10:11,410
I'm looking for my sister
and her boyfriend.

44
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:14,313
They were looking for a fan belt
or something.

45
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:18,122
I don't think I've seen them.

46
00:10:18,292 --> 00:10:20,556
This is the only gas station
in town, right?

47
00:10:20,728 --> 00:10:22,286
That's right.

48
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,191
Yeah, then they were definitely here.

49
00:10:28,636 --> 00:10:31,104
I just told you, I didn't see them.

50
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,837
Does somebody else work here?

51
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,909
No, I own the station.
And I would've seen them.

52
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:41,412
Well, I was just here a few minutes ago,
and you didn't see me.

53
00:10:41,749 --> 00:10:45,776
- You weren't even here.
- Sorry. Can't help you.

54
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,955
- What was that?
- Nothing. That was just my dog.

55
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:01,034
Actually, you know what?

56
00:11:01,368 --> 00:11:05,304
My brother vincent was down here for
a while. He could've helped your sister out.

57
00:11:05,673 --> 00:11:07,504
They could be up at the house.

58
00:11:13,013 --> 00:11:16,380
- No, my friend went that way earlier.
- Really?

59
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,413
Well, maybe he ran into my brother
up there, then.

60
00:11:36,303 --> 00:11:39,272
- Wanna head up to the house?
- Yeah, whatever.

61
00:11:55,556 --> 00:11:59,117
So, what's your sister
look like anyway?

62
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:04,624
Nick! Nick, help me!

63
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:13,202
Please help me! I'm down here!

64
00:12:41,035 --> 00:12:42,969
- Nick!
- Carly!

65
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,365
I'm downstairs!

66
00:12:47,374 --> 00:12:49,934
- Thank God.
- Jesus.

67
00:12:50,878 --> 00:12:52,573
Okay. I'm here. I got you.

68
00:12:56,517 --> 00:12:58,451
- Okay.
- Here.

69
00:12:58,619 --> 00:13:00,484
Watch my finger. Watch my finger.

70
00:13:00,688 --> 00:13:02,451
Oh, my God.

71
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,448
He did this to you?

72
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:14,160
Where is he?

73
00:13:16,804 --> 00:13:19,864
- Where is he?
- I locked him out.

74
00:13:20,407 --> 00:13:23,604
- Where the hell's Wade?
- I don't know. He went into the house.

75
00:13:23,777 --> 00:13:25,404
This place is a freak show.

76
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:40,225
Hello?

77
00:13:42,563 --> 00:13:44,292
Hello? Anyone here?

78
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:48,298
Carly, Wade.

79
00:13:48,969 --> 00:13:50,459
Hello?

80
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,539
Anyone here?

81
00:14:00,147 --> 00:14:02,274
This is a weird place.

82
00:14:04,785 --> 00:14:06,446
Hello?

83
00:14:07,922 --> 00:14:09,446
Anyone home?

84
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,253
Carly? Carly?

85
00:14:14,428 --> 00:14:18,956
Wade, what the hell are you doing, bro?
Everyone's waiting for you at the campsite.

86
00:14:23,037 --> 00:14:24,470
Wade?

87
00:14:30,144 --> 00:14:31,941
Holy shit, man.

88
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,977
Hold tight, man. Hold tight.
I'm gonna get you out of this.

89
00:14:39,787 --> 00:14:41,846
All right, I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

90
00:14:44,158 --> 00:14:45,716
Oh, my God.

91
00:14:47,494 --> 00:14:50,554
All right, all right.
What happened to you, man?

92
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,289
Holy...

93
00:15:11,185 --> 00:15:12,914
Hold on. Just hold on.

94
00:15:27,835 --> 00:15:29,666
No, no, don't...

95
00:15:52,092 --> 00:15:53,354
He's leaving.

96
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:03,431
All right, stay here.

97
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:13,912
Yeah.

98
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:18,810
All right. Car's by the road.
Damn it, Dalton's got the keys.

99
00:16:20,054 --> 00:16:21,578
Dalton.

100
00:16:22,923 --> 00:16:24,948
We gotta call the cops.

101
00:16:29,563 --> 00:16:31,030
Shit.

102
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,992
Hey, where's your cell phone?

103
00:16:35,736 --> 00:16:38,296
It might be in the truck
up near the house.

104
00:16:38,472 --> 00:16:40,463
What about Wade?
I think he has him too.

105
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:43,041
- What if he turns him to wax?
- What do you mean, wax?

106
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,907
You don't get it.
They're all wax, everyone.

107
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:50,616
No, wait.

108
00:16:52,853 --> 00:16:54,878
There was a woman in here.

109
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:57,746
She was alive.
She pulled the curtain back.

110
00:17:23,217 --> 00:17:25,310
The whole town is rigged.

111
00:17:25,486 --> 00:17:27,010
That's impossible.

112
00:17:33,393 --> 00:17:36,191
You're saying that
that's a real person...

113
00:17:37,531 --> 00:17:38,998
...underneath?
- Yes.

114
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,963
At the church, they were all like that.

115
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:44,296
At least 20 more.

116
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,181
Come here, baby.

117
00:18:27,447 --> 00:18:29,278
Shit.

118
00:18:51,438 --> 00:18:52,871
Come here, sexy.

119
00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:03,208
Baby, we need to talk.

120
00:19:04,084 --> 00:19:07,542
- I really need to talk to you.
- What's up with the music?

121
00:19:08,222 --> 00:19:09,450
What?

122
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,588
I'm not sure, and I don't wanna
freak you out...

123
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,660
- Wait, hold on.
- I need to tell you this.

124
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:18,923
- I'm just gonna go handle the music.
- No, let me just tell you...

125
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:20,293
Blake.

126
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:23,231
Goddamn it. I need to talk to you
for a minute.

127
00:19:23,403 --> 00:19:25,166
Blake!

128
00:19:33,847 --> 00:19:35,678
<i>Guys, where the hell are you?</i>

129
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:38,409
<i>Remember the truck that came</i>
<i>to the campsite last night?</i>

130
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:40,450
<i>I think we just ran into him. </i>

131
00:19:41,121 --> 00:19:44,249
- <i>Where's Wade?</i>
- <i>He's still in the bathroom, then. </i>

132
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:46,824
- <i>What are you doing?</i>
- <i>Waiting for Wade. </i>

133
00:19:46,994 --> 00:19:49,019
<i>This is my truck. </i>

134
00:19:49,196 --> 00:19:51,391
<i>You're the guy from the campsite. </i>

135
00:20:12,486 --> 00:20:14,010
Blake?

136
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:20,324
Blake?

137
00:20:30,904 --> 00:20:32,371
No!

138
00:24:38,552 --> 00:24:41,419
- He said he had a brother, right?
- Yeah.

139
00:24:41,588 --> 00:24:43,055
Vincent.

140
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,923
At the house of wax,
he did all the sculptures.

141
00:24:46,092 --> 00:24:48,822
He's gotta be the one
that does the wax.

142
00:24:48,995 --> 00:24:51,088
- What if he's around here somewhere?
- Yeah.

143
00:24:52,132 --> 00:24:53,360
Wait.

144
00:24:54,634 --> 00:24:57,933
Nick, what are you doing?
You gotta be careful.

145
00:24:58,104 --> 00:25:00,299
I am being careful.

146
00:25:07,914 --> 00:25:10,542
No, no, no. It'll make too much noise.

147
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:13,447
Why do you have to be
so damn stubborn? He will find us.

148
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,383
Yeah, chances are he will anyway.

149
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,750
At least with this,
he might not wanna find us.

150
00:25:23,663 --> 00:25:25,187
That's about right.

151
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:37,436
Go, Carly. Run!

152
00:26:28,662 --> 00:26:30,687
I know you're in here.

153
00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:47,731
Nick!

154
00:28:03,923 --> 00:28:05,788
<i>Edwin, you certainly can play,</i>
<i>can't you?</i>

155
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:08,860
<i>And you certainly can sing. </i>

156
00:28:41,294 --> 00:28:43,489
Empty shells.

157
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:48,028
Check him for ammo.

158
00:29:07,821 --> 00:29:09,721
There's nothing in his pockets.

159
00:29:12,425 --> 00:29:14,325
Give me this.

160
00:29:17,931 --> 00:29:20,559
Nick, let's get out of here.

161
00:29:20,733 --> 00:29:22,530
Let's go.

162
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:34,178
- Is there anybody left alive in this town?
- What about this vincent guy?

163
00:29:34,347 --> 00:29:37,748
Who knows if there even is a vincent.
We gotta get out of this place.

164
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:41,444
Look, what about Wade and Dalton?
We can't just leave them behind.

165
00:29:43,189 --> 00:29:46,716
- You said your cell phone's in the truck?
- Yeah.

166
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,094
All right, this is what we're gonna do.

167
00:29:49,262 --> 00:29:52,595
I'm gonna go to the truck and get
your phone, and see if I can get help.

168
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,131
- You go back to the road. Paige and Blake...
- No way. No.

169
00:29:56,302 --> 00:29:58,896
- I'm not leaving you.
- Why do you have to be so...

170
00:30:00,206 --> 00:30:01,537
...damn stubborn?

171
00:30:06,045 --> 00:30:10,277
Okay. We stick together,
nothing's gonna happen to us.

172
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,415
Yeah.

173
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,149
Come on.

174
00:30:18,992 --> 00:30:20,619
That way.

175
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:27,257
- It's under the front seat.
- Nice parking job.

176
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,408
It's not in there.

177
00:30:45,818 --> 00:30:47,285
Wade and Dalton.

178
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,650
Wade went in there and never came out.

179
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:53,281
All right.

180
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,785
We'll go in quick, one pass.

181
00:30:56,362 --> 00:30:59,729
If we can't find them,
we have to get the hell out of here.

182
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,230
Yeah.

183
00:31:04,337 --> 00:31:05,668
Let's try the back.

184
00:31:22,388 --> 00:31:24,083
Stay close.

185
00:32:30,523 --> 00:32:32,013
Dalton?

186
00:32:33,926 --> 00:32:35,484
Wade?

187
00:32:39,365 --> 00:32:42,459
Nick. Nick, there's guns.

188
00:33:04,424 --> 00:33:06,449
It's bolted to the wall.

189
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,488
There's gotta be a key
around here somewhere.

190
00:34:55,935 --> 00:34:57,562
Fuck!

191
00:35:56,762 --> 00:35:58,059
No.

192
00:36:35,635 --> 00:36:37,466
Goddamn it.

193
00:36:40,606 --> 00:36:43,803
I told him not to do that.

194
00:36:45,911 --> 00:36:48,573
Hey, you don't ever leave here
without me.

195
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,842
You know better than that.
Don't be so stupid.

196
00:36:52,018 --> 00:36:53,781
What's the matter with you?

197
00:37:00,126 --> 00:37:01,593
Don't.

198
00:37:02,228 --> 00:37:04,594
I said, don't. Get.

199
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,197
Get.

200
00:37:06,465 --> 00:37:07,727
Fucking freak.

201
00:37:34,994 --> 00:37:38,862
Hey, the town's looking real good.

202
00:37:39,031 --> 00:37:42,660
We almost finished what
Mama started. Those two are good.

203
00:37:42,835 --> 00:37:44,097
They'll fit perfect.

204
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:47,430
What'd I tell you, huh?

205
00:37:47,873 --> 00:37:50,364
Isn't your work more real now?

206
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,375
Ma would be proud.

207
00:37:53,346 --> 00:37:55,439
Yeah, she'd be real proud.

208
00:37:56,048 --> 00:37:59,677
She always said that your talent would
make up for what God took away from you.

209
00:38:02,722 --> 00:38:04,747
Now, there's two more.

210
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,823
We still got a lot of work to do.

211
00:38:50,169 --> 00:38:52,637
It's okay, it's okay. All right.

212
00:39:00,613 --> 00:39:03,605
I saw Paige and Blake's bodies.
They're dead.

213
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:07,011
We gotta go. Now.

214
00:39:21,133 --> 00:39:22,623
Damn.

215
00:39:28,641 --> 00:39:30,768
I can't see anything.

216
00:39:31,944 --> 00:39:34,139
There's gotta be a light
here somewhere.

217
00:40:15,321 --> 00:40:16,982
Come on.

218
00:40:34,173 --> 00:40:35,640
Dalton.

219
00:40:41,614 --> 00:40:43,138
Nick.

220
00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:11,542
I'll get you out of there.

221
00:41:15,314 --> 00:41:16,713
No.

222
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:20,283
No. Nick.

223
00:41:20,786 --> 00:41:22,651
Nick, please.

224
00:41:26,825 --> 00:41:29,293
No.

225
00:41:38,971 --> 00:41:40,438
That's vincent.

226
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:10,601
Come on, Carly. Move it. Move it!

227
00:42:24,116 --> 00:42:26,516
Nick, let's get out of here. Hurry!

228
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,525
Come on. Come this way.

229
00:42:49,141 --> 00:42:51,541
No. Oh, my God. Wade.

230
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,473
- Come on.
- No.

231
00:42:56,348 --> 00:42:58,009
You sick fuck!

232
00:43:57,876 --> 00:44:00,367
- You're finished.
- No.

233
00:44:58,036 --> 00:44:59,503
Carly, behind you!

234
00:45:10,182 --> 00:45:11,877
Come on.

235
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:13,847
Get up. Please.

236
00:45:22,961 --> 00:45:25,555
Run! Go, Carly! Run!

237
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,833
Hey, vincent.

238
00:45:32,037 --> 00:45:33,197
Hey.

239
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:35,706
Vincent.

240
00:45:36,975 --> 00:45:39,637
I swear to God, if you hurt her...

241
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:45,447
vincent!

242
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:00,117
No. Listen to me. Listen to me.

243
00:47:00,292 --> 00:47:02,624
I heard you talking.
You don't need to do this.

244
00:47:02,794 --> 00:47:07,493
You didn't have to listen to your brother.
I saw Bo's scars. And the highchairs.

245
00:47:07,666 --> 00:47:08,963
No!

246
00:47:10,502 --> 00:47:12,470
You're not a freak!

247
00:47:12,638 --> 00:47:14,503
He was!

248
00:47:37,596 --> 00:47:40,929
You don't need to do this. Please.

249
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:44,034
You're an artist. Bo was lying to you.

250
00:47:44,202 --> 00:47:48,639
He used you. Do you really think that your
mother would have wanted you to do this?

251
00:47:49,041 --> 00:47:50,474
Please don't kill me!

252
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,505
Motherfucker!

253
00:48:12,497 --> 00:48:14,192
Oh, shit.

254
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:19,303
Carly!

255
00:48:23,141 --> 00:48:24,802
I'm here.

256
00:48:38,023 --> 00:48:39,991
Carly, do it! Do it now!

257
00:48:58,677 --> 00:48:59,939
Come on.

258
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,940
- Nick, get up!
- Yeah.

259
00:49:14,526 --> 00:49:16,756
- We're almost there!
- Oh, God!

260
00:49:17,229 --> 00:49:18,594
How do we get out?

261
00:49:30,976 --> 00:49:33,444
- Watch out!
- Get back.

262
00:49:37,716 --> 00:49:39,616
Nick. The wall.

263
00:49:41,319 --> 00:49:43,082
Dig!

264
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,059
Faster! Faster!

265
00:49:54,933 --> 00:49:56,457
Dig!

266
00:49:57,169 --> 00:49:59,967
Come on, Carly. Faster!

267
00:50:02,607 --> 00:50:05,770
Go, go! Come on. Come on.

268
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:19,188
Oh, God!

269
00:51:19,651 --> 00:51:21,516
Watch yourself.

270
00:51:22,554 --> 00:51:24,988
It's over 70 and counting right now.

271
00:51:34,766 --> 00:51:36,893
Hey, that's my friend's camera.

272
00:51:37,269 --> 00:51:39,430
Hey, that's my friend's camera.

273
00:51:39,604 --> 00:51:42,004
Sorry, son. That's evidence.

274
00:51:42,941 --> 00:51:44,909
You guys okay?

275
00:51:46,244 --> 00:51:48,576
Well, don't worry.
We'll get you to the hospital.

276
00:51:48,947 --> 00:51:51,040
How could no one have known
about all of this?

277
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,517
Truth is, this town's hard as hell
to get to.

278
00:51:54,686 --> 00:51:58,087
It's been abandoned 10 years,
ever since that sugar mill shut down.

279
00:51:58,256 --> 00:52:00,247
Hell, it ain't even
on the map anymore.

280
00:52:00,525 --> 00:52:02,584
We found all those cars
in that old factory.

281
00:52:02,761 --> 00:52:05,730
Those Sinclair boys pulled people
off the interstate for years.

282
00:52:05,897 --> 00:52:10,960
If it wasn't for all the smoke from
the fire, we wouldn't have even known.

283
00:52:11,803 --> 00:52:13,964
Excuse me, sir.
Louis wants to talk to you.

284
00:52:14,139 --> 00:52:16,164
Yeah. Excuse me.

285
00:52:43,902 --> 00:52:46,393
Maybe there's some good memories
on this.

286
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,502
You took it?

287
00:52:48,907 --> 00:52:51,637
It just felt wrong leaving it behind.

288
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:53,277
You know?

289
00:52:53,845 --> 00:52:55,608
You okay?

290
00:52:57,249 --> 00:52:59,046
We're okay.

291
00:53:00,986 --> 00:53:02,817
<i>Sheriff?</i>

292
00:53:03,321 --> 00:53:07,417
- Yeah, Dave?
- <i>Ran the Sinclair family through CDIC.</i>

293
00:53:07,592 --> 00:53:09,787
<i>Trudy and the doctor didn't</i>
<i>have two sons. </i>

294
00:53:10,362 --> 00:53:11,989
<i>They had three. </i>
