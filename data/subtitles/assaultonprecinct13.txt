1
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,848
Listen to me. What are we
talking about, really?

2
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:18,452
Getting high? No. We're
talking about a journey, man.

3
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,156
A subconscious safari.

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,826
A mental expedition, okay?
A mind trek.

5
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,304
This planet has been raped,
pillaged and fucked, all right?

6
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:32,001
And the mind is the only
uncharted territory...

7
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:33,600
and this shit is the ship.

8
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:38,205
<i>It's the Niña, the Pinta and the Santa
Maria, and you are fucking Magellan.</i>

9
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:41,411
Oh, fuck! I spilled some!

10
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:45,413
So, what do you say, my
Serbian motherfucking friend?

11
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:48,322
Do you wanna take a trip or
do you wanna sit on your ass?

12
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,952
Yeah, okay, Napoleon,
let's see what you got.

13
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,392
Robi.

14
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,301
That dog is really creeping me
out, man. It's a big fucking dog.

15
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:05,433
It makes my girl very uneasy.
I don't really like dogs.

16
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,142
The pooch was not invited.

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,840
You don't talk about my
fucking dog, okay? I handle it.

18
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,184
Can you tie it up or
something? He do what I say.

19
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,217
Once I show him who's boss, with
a few treats and some smacks.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,074

21
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,334
Good boy. Here's treat.

22
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:40,604
He knows who's boss, yes? Shit,
man! Hey, hey, I got a dog, too.

23
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:44,580
Yo, Tony! I love this guy.
He works his ass off for piss.

24
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:48,812
All right, once I show him who's boss
with some few smacks and some treatsies.

25
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:52,514
You got that? You got a smoke? No,
no, I'm fucking out. I told you.

26
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,825
Are you giving me some static? No.

27
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,554
You giving me the hairy
eyeball? You Irish fucking pig!

28
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:00,658
Fuck! H uh? See?

29
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,793
I got my dog, too.

30
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,072
Here you go, dog.

31
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,076
Are you guys in? Are you in? Fuck you!

32
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:25,320
What's your fucking lackey saying?
He say that he knows your dog.

33
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,714
My dog?

34
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:31,022
He say that your dog testify at
his brother's trial three years ago.

35
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,391
Oh, shit.

36
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:36,832
He also say that your dog
is not even a fucking dog.

37
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,766
He's a dirty, fucking pig!

38
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,306
And I believe him.

39
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,710
Oh, God!

40
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,875
Fuck! Call for backup! Call for
backup! U nit 17 requesting backup.

41
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,283
You okay? Fourth floor, one suspect.

42
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,255
Yeah, I'm all right. Come on!

43
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,651
Good dog. Good dog.
Shit! Shit!

44
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,590
All right, Coral, you take
that back stairwell there.

45
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,188
Got it.
Tony, come on.

46
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,927
Come on. Oh, shit. Okay.

47
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,662
You take this hallway
on the right. All right.

48
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,296
I'll take the left.
Got you.

49
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,204
Can't believe
that cocksucker shot me.

50
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,264
Let's go.

51
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:21,035
Shit!

52
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,517
Tony! Tony?

53
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,427
Oh, shit.

54
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,798
Officer down!
I repeat, officer down!

55
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:45,926
Suspect on north stairway!
I'm going after him!

56
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,399
And where the fuck
is my backup?

57
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,319
Freeze!

58
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,886
Shit.

59
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,900
Shit. Shit. Shit. Help me!

60
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:28,934
I'm a police officer! Help me!
Call an ambulance!

61
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,313
Shit. Shit. Call an ambulance!

62
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,309
Shit!

63
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:47,554
Hello?

64
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,489
Yeah. Shit, yeah.

65
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:56,122
No, no, no. I'm up. I'm up. I'll
be right there. All right. Bye.

66
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,269
Hi. Good morning, buddy.

67
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,570
Come here, shithead.
Come here.

68
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,606
Good morning.

69
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:04,860
<i>It's cold, people.</i>

70
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,926
<i>Detroit"s gonna have a white
New Year"s this year...</i>

71
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,995
<i>because we"re getting hit
with yet another storm.</i>

72
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,040
<i>No shit.
Sports coming up.</i>

73
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,441
This kind of sex...

74
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,110
is evolutionary instinct,
gentlemen.

75
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:59,679
Example, Tiger Stadium. Bleachers
empty, except me and a friend.

76
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,053
We always get it on
whenever and wherever we can.

77
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:07,722
No one saw us except for the left fielder.
Let's just say he enjoyed the show...

78
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,062
and, well,
I didn't mind the audience.

79
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:13,398
Impulsive sex is in our genes,
boys. Don't deny yourselves.

80
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,166
I gotta go jump in the snow
to cool my shit off.

81
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,073
Have a good New Year, I.
You, too, babe.

82
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:22,237
That animal is your type,
Iris. Probably an ex-con.

83
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,975
You two should hook up.
Shit. Fuck off, Carlyle.

84
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,609
We were just talking about
acting on impulses with no guilt.

85
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,745
Don't get angry, I. You only bed
criminals. Everyone knows that.

86
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:34,291
Which is unfortunate for me,
because I am in love with you.

87
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,157
I don't bed criminals. I
fuck bad boys. Big difference.

88
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:40,788
I just hope I don't have to become a
fucking ax murderer to prove I'm worthy.

89
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,855
What the hell is this?
Fun and games?

90
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,093
Buzz kill.

91
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,726
Does anybody work
around here anymore?

92
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:46,928
Hey, Sarge,
you're late.

93
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,733
Happy New Year.
Hey, you're pissing me off.

94
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,796
Get out of here before I
give you something to do.

95
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,172
I think you boys don't wanna
get stuck with us here tonight.

96
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,405
Bye, boys. I'll see you
guys at the new precinct.

97
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,607
Happy New Year, Iris.
Later, Iris.

98
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,917
Stuck?
That's not very nice, boss.

99
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:05,887
You're right. I apologize.
You're lovely and amazing...

100
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:09,016
and it's my honor to spend
New Year's Eve with you.

101
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,584
You're a sarcastic prick,
aren't you?

102
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,630
We are going to have
a good time tonight, boss.

103
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:17,099
We officially shut down at midnight,
but all calls are being diverted...

104
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,260
so we might as well
be closed now.

105
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,800
We could start
getting fucked up real early!

106
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:25,638
All right, not too early, all right?
We still gotta pack this shit up.

107
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,838
Not much. All the computers
are gone, most of the gear.

108
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,712
Now, come on, Sarge.
It's my favorite holiday.

109
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:36,012
I even put on my very special,
sexy holiday boots.

110
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:41,356
Even though we're here, I wanna do it
right. How could you possibly do it wrong?

111
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,475
<i>Never take for granted
the greatest power of all.</i>

112
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,480
<i>The power to choose.</i>

113
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,552
<i>Consider the choices
you have made in the past.</i>

114
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:14,019
<i>And when they led you astray.
Faith, in times of opposition...</i>

115
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,720
<i>will lead to your salvation,
for often the easy way...</i>

116
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,358
<i>will lead only to temptation.</i>

117
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,957
<i>Think of consequences...</i>

118
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:29,304
<i>and cherish your power
to choose the righteous path.</i>

119
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:33,368
You figure I'd be more liable to
tell the truth with God watching.

120
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,344
If you believe in God,
Mr. Portnow.

121
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,778
You don't? Never met a
brother who didn't have faith.

122
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,857
I've stood in front
of dozens of men...

123
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:50,018
who were all
staring death in the face.

124
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:54,262
Every single one of them
begged for God's help.

125
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,626
After seeing all those pleas
go unanswered...

126
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:03,196
I lost my faith.

127
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,799
<i>And know
that promise lies ahead.</i>

128
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,271
<i>If we believe His word.</i>

129
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,171
So, what's the what?

130
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,314
My answer is this.

131
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:18,218
<i>And in the day of rebellion,
I tell them, "Go forth. "</i>

132
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,517
No.

133
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,822
<i>Hold your head high...</i>

134
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,588
I guess we're done here.

135
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:29,322
<i>This day is the first day...</i>

136
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:33,461
What'd you think, I was gonna let you walk
out of here with the crowd for protection?

137
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,835
Get the fuck up.
Walk in front of me.

138
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,175
Police!

139
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,063
Hold it right there!

140
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,733
Freeze, Bishop!
Drop your weapon!

141
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,102
Drop it now, motherfucker!

142
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,648
We're here
at the new Precinct 21...

143
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,519
where one of the city's most powerful
crime figures, Marion Bishop...

144
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:03,992
is being held in the alleged murder
of an undercover police officer.

145
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:07,120
Bishop, notorious for his
brutal execution methods...

146
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:11,532
earns untold millions from his various
criminal operations in the Detroit area.

147
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,671
Bishop's crew.

148
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:29,845
Yeah?

149
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,518
Come on.

150
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,484
Now is not the time.

151
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:41,692
I'm Lieutenant Holloway.

152
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:45,064
Marcus Duvall, Organized
Crime and Racketeering Squad.

153
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,967
This is my team.
I know who you are.

154
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:50,439
Sorry about your man. Where
is this son of a bitch?

155
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,404
I don't spend one night,
not one night inside...

156
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,612
and we both know why.

157
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,240
You do whatever you have to do
to get me out of here.

158
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,715
Do you understand?

159
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,514
That guy's a cop killer.

160
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,117
J udge hands down bail...

161
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,555
I swear to Christ, I'll...

162
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,487
No arraignment
'cause of the holiday.

163
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:18,023
Bishop spends two days inside
until he has a chance to make bail.

164
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,264
Don't worry, Cap. We got him. We
ain't gonna fucking let him go.

165
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,208
Happy New Year!

166
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,780
Come on, man,
there's only three of us here.

167
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:39,049
Yeah, well, one of us is Irish.
My God, look at this thing.

168
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:43,923
That's gotta be older than me.
You'll never take me alive, G-man!

169
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,387
Look at this room.

170
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,828
Boy, there's got to be
evidence in here...

171
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,424
from some of my first busts
back in the day.

172
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:55,132
They got rid of all the Civil
War stuff. Hey, that's so funny.

173
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,534
Don't quit the day job,
all right?

174
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,367
Sarge?
Yeah?

175
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,376
Your Friday
appointment's here.

176
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,340
Are you kidding me?

177
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:06,908
Any feelings of anxiety lately? Yeah.

178
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,851
Two words. The Lions.

179
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,547
They give me
a lot of anxiety.

180
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:16,149
Please stop avoiding
my questions, Sergeant.

181
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,723
Are you still taking
the painkillers?

182
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,192
Come on, Doc.

183
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:26,662
I mean, even you have got to be getting
a little bored of these conversations.

184
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:29,535
Why don't we talk
about the real reason...

185
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,171
that you would come down here
on New Year's Eve...

186
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,075
in the middle of this storm?

187
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:39,440
Okay. Let's see.
We had an appointment.

188
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:44,715
I think the real reason
is you're in love with me.

189
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,715
I can see it in your eyes. Interesting.

190
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,487
That's why you come
wearing these fancy clothes.

191
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:54,822
It's very flattering, but I think
you should stop denying it, you know?

192
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:58,232
I hear... No, I hear you. You're
right. You're right. You're right!

193
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,099
My face obviously betrays me.

194
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,603
I didn't get dressed up
like this...

195
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,367
because I'm going to a New Year's
Eve party later tonight. Oh, no.

196
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:08,173
No, Sergeant.
This was all for you.

197
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,977
A form of seduction.
Is it working?

198
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:13,846
Wonderfully.

199
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,483
I'm glad.

200
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,314
Okay, well, we'll have to finish
this conversation another time.

201
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,595
What is this thing you got?
Hey, hey, hey that's mine.

202
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,791
All right, relax.
I don't care about the file.

203
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:32,324
So, you got a desk job
at Precinct 21, I see.

204
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,598
Oh, Jesus H. Christ.
You don't quit, do you?

205
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,366
How do you feel about it?

206
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,498
How do I feel about it?
It's no big change.

207
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:42,204
So, I guess the new year's not
bringing anything different for you.

208
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,572
How's your leg, by the way? I
noticed you weren't limping anymore.

209
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:49,778
What's that supposed to mean?
It's just an observation.

210
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:53,248
Five years of undercover work
and now this. Wow!

211
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:54,614
Goodbye.

212
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,090
You must be itching
to get back on the streets.

213
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,183
Goodbye.

214
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:59,228
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year to you.

215
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:02,697
I'll see you at the new precinct.
God, you know, I cannot wait.

216
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,529
I'd walk you out, you know,
but I just have so much...

217
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,867
I know the way, thank you.
So much to do.

218
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,875
Jake, you should see this.

219
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,713
<i>And now,
Lieutenant Marcus Duvall...</i>

220
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,983
<i>that's Officer Ray Portnow's
superior, is coming out of...</i>

221
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,754
Hey, that's Duvall.
Good cop. Good man.

222
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,557
<i>...notorious crime kingpin
Marion Bishop in custody.</i>

223
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,324
That man is in hell right now.

224
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:38,527
<i>...responsible for the slaying, the
fifth in Motor City this year alone.</i>

225
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,169
Hey, you okay, Jake?

226
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,330
<i>We'll have more details on this
story as they become available.</i>

227
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,904
Everybody in the bus. You
know what a bus looks like.

228
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:49,877
New Year's Eve in a house with
a thousand doors. How about that?

229
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,742
You'll be sitting
in that cell of yours.

230
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,979
You're gonna want some champagne
and you're not gonna get any.

231
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,886
No. No, no, Dick Clark's
Happy Rocking New Year's Eve.

232
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,220
Losers. I ain't no
loser, baby, all right?

233
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:05,023
I'm just trying to exist 'cause my
people lack the power to consume...

234
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,429
what the media emphasizes in society, so
I'm forced to take shit that ain't mine.

235
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,193
Simply how it is. What?
Beck, your eyes are red.

236
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,563
How come, you been snorting,
you been drinking?

237
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,261
I don't know, your eyes are glazed.
What, you been eating doughnuts?

238
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:14,929
Is that what it is? That's
funny. Pretty original, too.

239
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:17,803
Is it funny, motherfucker? Where'd
you read that? In a comic book?

240
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,808
Get in the fucking back...

241
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,514
Round them up.

242
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,932
Well, we won't need
that anymore.

243
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:58,206
All right, boys and girls. We
must raise our glasses in a toast.

244
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,876
A toast to this old shithole
before they tear it down.

245
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,079
I got a terrible feeling
I'm gonna miss this place.

246
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,282
Of course, not as much
as I'm gonna miss you two.

247
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:09,951
What are you talking about?
I have news, boys and girls.

248
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,461
Old school here is retiring.

249
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,563
You're kidding.
I'm packing it in.

250
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,362
J ust like this place.
Congratulations, Jasper.

251
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:20,869
But why didn't you tell us? I
just got the word officially.

252
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:25,704
Anyway, here's to this old shithole.
Here's to me and here's to my new life.

253
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,343
Cheers.
Cheers.

254
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,074
Cheers!

255
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:37,246
And now, little lady,
may I have this dance...

256
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,413
to celebrate
my retirement, huh?

257
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,718
Come on.

258
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:45,757
Don't go away,
maybe you'll learn something.

259
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,942
One more. There you go.

260
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,558
We never should've left
in this shit.

261
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:50,684
Shit. What do you mean?

262
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,661
Their captain didn't want
these scumbags in there.

263
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,324
Wanted to give his men
more time off for the holiday.

264
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,698
You're Marion Bishop.
Marion Bishop.

265
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,371
Chief, head cheddar
and whatnot, baby.

266
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:07,100
You know, I heard about you
getting shot five times, man.

267
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:08,234
Five fucking times.

268
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,677
What was it, your left
shoulder, your stomach...

269
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:13,307
upper back, lower back,
right hip? Ain't that a bitch?

270
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:16,478
You didn't wanna die though, right,
'cause you're a persistent motherfucker?

271
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,920
You're like the black Rasputin
and whatnot. I'm serious, man.

272
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,095
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Beck.

273
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:30,394
I'm an entrepreneurial motherfucker
like yourself, slash lawyer, slash...

274
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,469
Got any openings, man?
Throw me a bone or something?

275
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,733
Hey, what the fuck's
going on, man?

276
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,047
Pump the brakes, God damn it!

277
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:47,776
Don't slam them!
Shut the fuck up!

278
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,080
Hey, Ray Charles, slow
this motherfucker down, man!

279
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,451
Officer Balls
and Officer Cock.

280
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:58,054
Eye contact, man. Eye contact.
Let me tell you something.

281
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:01,791
The Constitution requires that
the state provide secure...

282
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:03,093
Sit down.
... incarceration.

283
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,192
I'm just saying that I'm
feeling pretty fucking unsafe.

284
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,963
Shut the fuck up.

285
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,735
<i>Transport 1121,
this is Dispatch.</i>

286
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,540
Transport 1121, Dispatch. Go.

287
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:20,579
<i>We're gonna have to reroute you to
Precinct 13 until the storm breaks.</i>

288
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,242
No problem.
What's going on, Dispatch?

289
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:26,015
<i>There was an injury accident
on the Parkway 101.</i>

290
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:29,320
<i>We're getting everyone off the road.
You'll stay at 13 until further orders.</i>

291
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,554
<i>They've already been advised.
Copy.</i>

292
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:35,162
13, what a piece of shit.
I don't care.

293
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,264
J ust glad to get out of this.

294
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:57,148
Well, how about this
for a New Year's present?

295
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,087
That scumbag, Bishop,
is hand-delivered to us!

296
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:03,387
I'm gonna get some righteous payback
from that skel for Ray Portnow.

297
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,484
What are you doing here? What?

298
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,656
I've heard so much about this Bishop
guy over the years. I wanna see him.

299
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,393
I thought you gave up
bad boys. Get back inside.

300
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,663
It's not the New Year
yet, Sarge.

301
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,305
You must be Roenick.

302
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:26,371
No offense, officer, but I'm
pretty fucking perturbed about this.

303
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,315
We're closing down.
We're short-staffed.

304
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,614
Central said we park here
overnight until the road's clear.

305
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:31,983
You got a problem with that,
call it in.

306
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:33,852
Yeah, I already tried. All
right, I'll give it another shot.

307
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:37,291
Jake, come on. Jake, you're not gonna
send these guys back out in that weather.

308
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:40,557
Now, look. We'll lock them up
and we'll let them be. No problem.

309
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,758
All right, fine, fine, but
they're your responsibility.

310
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:45,426
I don't wanna hear jack shit
about them or from them.

311
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,561
Let's go. Inside. Bring them
in. Come on, bring them in!

312
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:58,946
Interesting cast.

313
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,609
Yeah, we got
a female gangbanger...

314
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,785
who swears she never
committed a crime in her life.

315
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,480
This guy here specializes
in counterfeit merchandise.

316
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:11,493
Need a fake Rolex,
he's your man.

317
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,227
Some junkie who robbed a deli.

318
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,458
Allegedly.

319
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,331
Allegedly. He's still riding
on a high right now.

320
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:24,501
And the star of the show. He needs
no intro. You know his credits.

321
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:28,706
Sarge...

322
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:33,015
when it rains, it snows.
Got another freaking guest.

323
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:39,152
How's your car?
Won't move.

324
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,923
Must've walked two miles
in this damn weather.

325
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,222
I'm soaking. Look at me. Well,
thank God you're not hurt.

326
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:49,562
So, how did you enjoy your file?
Oh, yeah, yeah, you dropped this...

327
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:53,359
Oh, really? I dropped it? That's strange,
because I was sure that you took it.

328
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:54,995
Definitely dropped it.

329
00:24:58,396 --> 00:24:59,966
That's disappointing.

330
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,635
If you had stolen it, it
would've been the first time...

331
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:05,647
you were taking a proactive
interest in your therapy.

332
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:09,344
And you know it's a bunch
of bullshit. So, you read it?

333
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,387
Yeah, I fucking read it.

334
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,988
Did you steal it? You know I
stole it, all right, you know.

335
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:19,425
And stop being so goddamn
happy about it, Dr. Sabian.

336
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:20,655
It makes me sick.

337
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:24,394
"I think he's hiding behind his
injury. He's not really hurt.

338
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,697
"Jake Roenick no longer
considers himself a cop. "

339
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,931
What kind of bullshit
is that, huh?

340
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:31,974
You think I'm scared? That's what
it is, right? You think I'm scared.

341
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,703
If you've read further on, you
would see that's not what I think.

342
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:38,076
All right, well, then tell me what it
is that you think, Dr. Mrs. Mindfuck?

343
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,774
What is it that you think
I'm hiding from?

344
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:43,285
I'm not gonna explain myself to you if
you're gonna act like a child, excuse me.

345
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:44,478
Run away.

346
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:48,149
We both know you can't handle this
shit 'cause you want to fuck me.

347
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:55,159
Sergeant, if I wanted to fuck
you, it would've happened already.

348
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,766
Gotta learn
to control yourself, Doc.

349
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:59,324
It's affecting your work, you
know? It's very unprofessional.

350
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,098
Don't try to discredit me because
you're afraid I may be right.

351
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,195
Right?
Yes.

352
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:04,330
About what? Come on.

353
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,307
Tell me what it is you think
I'm hiding from...

354
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,207
and then I'll tell you
whether I think you're right.

355
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:09,540
Okay!

356
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:14,950
I believe that the prospect of
responsibility has rendered you impotent!

357
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:16,382
Lmpotent?
Yes.

358
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:19,114
And that's why you're working at
this old precinct behind a desk.

359
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:21,384
Look, I'm injured, all right?
That's why I'm here.

360
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:24,620
Bullshit! You feel responsible for the
death of your team eight months ago...

361
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,025
and that's why you're here!

362
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,997
I didn't do anything wrong.
A board of inquiry cleared me.

363
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,432
That's right.
You didn't do anything wrong.

364
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,960
But it was your decision that sent them
down the left hallway and not the right...

365
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,302
out the front door
and not the back!

366
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:43,305
And you don't want to make
decisions like that again.

367
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,780
Yeah, so?
Yeah, maybe you're right.

368
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:48,676
What, you want a medal?

369
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,322
So, now you're hiding
behind that desk...

370
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,886
and behind that liquor
in your drawer...

371
00:26:56,948 --> 00:27:01,021
and those pills in that
stupid little matchbox.

372
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:06,691
But there's still one life you're responsible
for, no matter where you go, you know?

373
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:09,636
Oh, let me guess. My
own? Yeah, your own.

374
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:12,640
And if you don't start
taking care of yourself...

375
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:15,268
you're never gonna be
the cop you used to be.

376
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,553
Bishop.

377
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,992
Bish.

378
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:47,640
Bish, Bish, Bish, Bish, Bish!

379
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:52,639
All right.

380
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:57,142
Yo.

381
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,449
Bish, Bish. Bish, just check
it out. Check it out, man.

382
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,651
Puerto Rican guy and a black
guy in a car. Who's driving?

383
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,323
The cops.

384
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:11,332
You're killing me, man. You're
killing me. That was... That was...

385
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:15,166
We had something.
Did you feel that?

386
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:18,835
Okay.

387
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,467
This jail shit
ain't for Smiley.

388
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:26,171
This is definitely
out of Smiley's essence.

389
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:30,014
Who the fuck I'm Smiley.
Is Smiley? Me, I'm Smiley.

390
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:36,582
Look, I'm facing a lot of jail time here.
I didn't do shit to be up in this bitch.

391
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,988
They looking for my sister
and they picked me up.

392
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,929
I ain't never committed a
crime in my motherfucking life!

393
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:44,363
Right, right.

394
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:00,372
What, you still waiting
for that tow truck?

395
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:03,210
It's not gonna come.

396
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,454
Oh, shit.
It's almost time, people.

397
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:20,161
Bish, how you get
in the life, man?

398
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:24,606
For me it was... I wanted this bicycle.
I was always praying for it, right?

399
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:27,608
And God, in all his wisdom,
decided not to give it to me...

400
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:31,544
so I stole it and then I asked
him to forgive me after that...

401
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,481
but that was the beginning, man.
I could never stop after that shit.

402
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,643
That was...
It was over for me.

403
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:41,382
All right.

404
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,330
Okay. Okay. 20...

405
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:56,930
19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14...

406
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:59,702
13, 12, 11...

407
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:03,211
10, 9, 8, 7... Listen to
them trying to demoralize us.

408
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,811
...6, 5, 4...

409
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:10,219
3, 2, 1!
Happy New Yearl

410
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:13,913
You gonna do it?
I'm doing it.

411
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,794
Look at him.

412
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:25,526
All jacked up and shit,
sweating out his fucking ass.

413
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,434
Looking like fucking
Mike Tyson in a spelling bee.

414
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,744
What, you two slandering me?
You slandering me?

415
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,540
I'll give you
some free advice. Don't.

416
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,843
Yo, why don't you leave her
alone, you fucking junkie?

417
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,940
Leave her the fuck alone.
Who's talking to you, man?

418
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,247
Yeah, but I'm talking to you.
So, what's the problem?

419
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,118
What was that?
You heard me.

420
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:49,453
Who the fuck are you pushing, man?
I'll smack the smack out of you!

421
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,388
All right, man.

422
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,831
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.

423
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:03,806
Happy New Year.

424
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:17,675
...motherfucker up. That's it,
you freaking little bitch-ass punk!

425
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,754
I'll fuck you up!

426
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:33,458
Hey!

427
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,262
Hey, you fucking animals!

428
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,330
What the hell?

429
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:42,371
Who the hell
you pushing on?

430
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,107
What the fuck?

431
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:47,274
Get off. Oh, shit!
What's that?

432
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:48,680
Shit!

433
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,981
Won't you fucking monkeys
keep it down for Christ's sake.

434
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:55,149
Hey, stop yelling, you fucking
animals! It's only New Year's...

435
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,581
Who the fuck are you?

436
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,759
What's going on
down there?

437
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:14,740
Hey, Rosy!

438
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:17,809
I'm all right.

439
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:21,009
Are you all right?
Stay with him. Stay with him.

440
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,618
Get us out of here!
Get us out of here, man!

441
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:28,720
Iris, get in here!
Get in here!

442
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:32,284
What the fuck is going on?

443
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:38,925
Son of a bitch!

444
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,340
J ust keep breathing!
What the hell is going on?

445
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,246
Shit.

446
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:09,156
Oh, man!
Come on.

447
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:16,970
Come on. Come on.
Hang on. God damn it!

448
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:18,964
Look at that.

449
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,770
Rosy, yeah, that's right.

450
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,005
Talk to me, God damn it!
Talk to me!

451
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,416
Keep breathing,
God damn it! Rosy!

452
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,781
Iris!

453
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:35,079
Iris.

454
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,562
How is he? Is he all right?

455
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:45,623
"Is he all right?"
He's dead for Christ's sake!

456
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,864
That's how all right he is!
God damn it! Fucking Bishop!

457
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,936
It was his guys. They're
trying to bust him out of here!

458
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,030
You son of a bitch!

459
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:53,370
Come on,
get us out of here!

460
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:55,672
Get us out of here, man. Come on.
All right, relax! All right, relax!

461
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:58,145
The threat is over!
Look, get us out of here!

462
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,586
Calm down! The threat is over.

463
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:06,143
You fucking kidding me,
Sergeant?

464
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:11,422
Oh, I know. I know. Take it easy,
come on. How's he doing, Iris?

465
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:14,428
I'm sorry about your partner.
We just moved him to an office.

466
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,988
Oh, shit.
He needs a doctor fast.

467
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,831
Why wasn't there an alarm
on your back door?

468
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,839
That alarm hasn't worked in
months. They're still out there.

469
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:27,433
Some kind of a truck out there
in the forest. It's not moving.

470
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:30,968
Are you kidding me? They must
have assumed we'd call for backup.

471
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:35,841
I'm having a little problem
here. The phones aren't working.

472
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,283
Sure, they cut the wires.

473
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,081
The storm
could've taken the phones out.

474
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:42,681
Bullshit. Those are Bishop's guys
out there. They cut the wires.

475
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:46,353
J ust try the radios! Forget
it. Frequencies are blocked.

476
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,760
The frequencies are blocked?
That's not easy to do.

477
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,697
Well, they must've got
professional help then...

478
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,666
because all the frequencies
are blocked.

479
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:55,396
They probably screwed up
your cell phones, too.

480
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,564
I'm not getting a signal.

481
00:34:57,628 --> 00:35:02,543
Neither am I. What the hell is this? I
told you! They're Bishop's guys out there!

482
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,277
They're gonna break him out
of here one way or another.

483
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:08,339
Maybe somebody heard the gunshots
and will come check it out.

484
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:11,079
Nothing out there but factories.
No, no. I don't buy any of that.

485
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,382
They, whoever they are,
are gone.

486
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,944
And if they did hear the gunshots,
they're gonna think they're fireworks.

487
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:15,490
They don't give a shit about
me and I'm going. Thank you!

488
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,494
Oh, my God.

489
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:22,860
What the hell
is happening here?

490
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,923
This is a fucking police
precinct for God's sake!

491
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,524
Jesus Christ!

492
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:30,834
Sarge, if you're all right,
you better take a look at this.

493
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,338
They're surrounding the place.
It's a goddamn siege.

494
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:45,244
I am not supposed to be here.
Not supposed to be here.

495
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,152
I'm not supposed to be here.

496
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,680
Shit!

497
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:54,823
Cease fire! Cease fire! Cease
fire! It wasn't gunshots.

498
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:59,827
Bishop. I told you. Those
are Bishop's troops out there.

499
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:02,132
They're taking him out of here
tonight, no matter what!

500
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,935
This doesn't make any sense.
This is a police precinct!

501
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,736
Shut the fuck up, Doc.
You said that already.

502
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:09,277
All right, look.
Everybody just listen up.

503
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,345
Maybe they're trying to give
us a way out of this.

504
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:17,378
Let's just give them what they want.
Let them have Bishop and it's all over.

505
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:20,717
Nobody else gets hurt!
Not a bad fucking idea.

506
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:25,689
No, we can't let that scumbag
gangster, a cop killer...

507
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:28,228
walk out of our precinct!
It's not an option!

508
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,787
I'm trying
to defuse this situation.

509
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,732
You got a wounded cop over
there! I already said no!

510
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,634
What in God's name are we
supposed to do then, Sergeant?

511
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:39,470
They're getting ready to storm the
fort here. I don't think so, all right?

512
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,909
I think they're just trying to
scare us into giving up Bishop.

513
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,380
They're doing a damn good job.

514
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,460
You see this blackout, this is the kind
of shit that deflates human smugness...

515
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,092
about the government's so-called
miraculous technologies, doesn't it?

516
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,603
Shove it up their lying,
corporate fucking asses.

517
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:12,663
This ain't no blackout, junkie.
Something suspect is going on.

518
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,766
I wanna know
what the funk it is.

519
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,344
I know it hurts, but we just got
to get you away from these windows.

520
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,747
All right. All right.
Hell of an attack scenario.

521
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:25,844
They've blinded us.
They can see 20/20.

522
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,148
Jasper, you got
those flashlights?

523
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:28,853
I don't know
where the fuck they are!

524
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:29,948
Everything's been packed.

525
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:33,552
Roenick!
Get down! Get down!

526
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,961
Jasper, get the blinds!

527
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,967
All right. All right.

528
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,208
Yeah, we're
perfectly safe now.

529
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:54,178
These are just
scare tactics, all right?

530
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:56,809
They don't know how much
firepower we have or don't have.

531
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:59,854
They're not gonna come in
here again. It's too risky.

532
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,915
What about us
getting out there, Sergeant?

533
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,122
I need help real bad.

534
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,164
I need it.

535
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,705
Let's barricade up
these doors and windows...

536
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:30,714
and I'll figure out
how to get some help in here.

537
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:46,731
What are you doing
this for, Jake?

538
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,498
Nobody gives a shit anymore
about anything.

539
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,300
We can end this right now. I can't
let a murderer walk out of here.

540
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:54,740
Can't do that.

541
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:58,810
I'll get us out of this,
Jasper, I will. I promise.

542
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,250
You got almost no chance
out there, buddy.

543
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:05,110
That cop in there dies
if I don't try.

544
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:10,982
You keep the place locked down
until I get some help.

545
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:14,993
All right.

546
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:20,867
I'd better cover from the front windows.
I can see the truck better from there.

547
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,573
Keep your head down.

548
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,606
Schmuck.

549
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:02,471
Shit!

550
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:07,933
Oh, shit!

551
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:47,310
I found this
on our friend out there.

552
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,523
Fuck it. Fact or fiction? You pulled
a guy's spine out once, didn't you?

553
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:02,256
You a surgeon?

554
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:06,528
I heard that bullet you took in your belly
is still lodged in there rattling around.

555
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,002
I bet you it's causing you
a lot of intestinal issues.

556
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,129
Right? Right, man?

557
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:16,469
Bishop, I need to talk to you.

558
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,545
So, I just killed a man.

559
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:27,021
H is name was Danny Barbero.

560
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:32,353
A cop. A cop who works
for Ray Portnow.

561
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:35,028
The man you killed.

562
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:40,394
So, tell me why cops are risking
their lives to get to you, Bishop?

563
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,268
Why should I answer
that question?

564
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,807
Because I'm thinking about
sending you out to the wolves...

565
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:48,002
and saving my own ass
if you don't.

566
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:01,082
I assume you know who I am,
Sergeant. You're a scumbag gangster.

567
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:05,918
And one of my scumbag partners in crime
is your fellow officer, Marcus Duvall.

568
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:08,456
Marcus Duvall
and his entire team.

569
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:12,626
We used to split things 50-50.
Marcus got greedy. He wanted more.

570
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:16,366
So, you killed Ray Portnow?
After he tried to kill me.

571
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:18,662
Right.

572
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:21,709
They're here to execute me
because if I make it to court...

573
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:25,940
every single one of them goes to
jail for the rest of their days.

574
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,176
How many cops
are involved in this?

575
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:32,117
I can't say exactly, but the blood money
runs through your entire department.

576
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:36,852
I bet they're all here now and they can't
allow me to leave this precinct alive.

577
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:40,059
They can't allow any of us
to leave here alive.

578
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:43,164
Now that we all know
it's them out there.

579
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:45,996
Sarge.

580
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:51,803
Poor guy, he never had a chance.
Anyone know if he had any family?

581
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,734
Someone's coming!
Shit, someone's coming!

582
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,743
Someone's coming.
All right. Jasper.

583
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,745
H it squad, Sergeant.

584
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,387
They're here for all of us. Me?

585
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:11,719
All of us. You especially.

586
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:14,628
Fuck you, dealer.
This is all your fault.

587
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:17,358
Those are your brethren
out there, old man, not mine.

588
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,992
Don't compare me with your
scumbag friends out there.

589
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:23,037
If it was up to me, I'd
kick your ass out the door.

590
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:24,435
I'd like to see
you come try it.

591
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,100
Yeah, sure. You'd love to kill
another cop today, wouldn't you?

592
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,404
Only you.

593
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,202
They'll be coming on
strong now.

594
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:35,045
Why? Why? Why are cops
coming to kill us?

595
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:36,777
They need to kill him...

596
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:39,412
before he fingers them
in court.

597
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,421
They need to kill us, too,
now that we know it's them.

598
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:42,581
Oh, my God.

599
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,320
So, here's
what we're gonna do.

600
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:50,260
We're gonna take positions
all around the precinct...

601
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,766
and we're gonna hold them off
until dawn.

602
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:56,101
Iris, Alex, you know
how to use a firearm?

603
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,105
No. No.

604
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,972
Why don't you give me
one of them guns, Sergeant?

605
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:04,541
I'll help you fend off
the black hats.

606
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,323
Oh, shit. Men are here. Good.

607
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,699
What a fucking mess this is.

608
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,131
I know.

609
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:35,707
I'm looking at this as a
matter of simple mathematics.

610
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:39,004
If we walk and those
eight people survive...

611
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:42,278
then 33 lives are destroyed.

612
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:47,018
The lives of my men
and their families.

613
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:50,458
People I'm responsible for.

614
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,626
People I...

615
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,599
People I love.

616
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:00,993
I don't see
any other way, Marcus.

617
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:05,232
The blood trail leads right
back to us. We have no choice.

618
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,134
We go through this...

619
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:12,478
we are gonna have to live with
this for the rest of our lives.

620
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:15,881
But you know something, Mike?

621
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,080
I could live with that...

622
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,152
more than I could live
with a cellmate.

623
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,125
Once we step outside...

624
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,589
those people are no longer
civilians or cops.

625
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:33,632
We got to put them all down.

626
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:38,669
Without pause, without regard.

627
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:41,633
1, 024.

628
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:44,978
2, 048.

629
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,006
4, 096.

630
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:57,081
Obsessive-compulsive disorder.

631
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:01,486
The complex problems
force me to concentrate...

632
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:05,961
neutralizing any feelings of
fear I have at a given moment.

633
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:09,063
I hide behind its structure.

634
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:13,840
You're gonna be
all right, Doc.

635
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:17,769
No. You don't know that.
You don't know that.

636
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,037
You're so calm.

637
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:28,245
Thank you so much. Thanks.

638
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:37,058
You don't have to do
this. Yes, I do. I do.

639
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:40,999
If I'm gonna die, at least
I should die gracefully.

640
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,335
How are you
keeping it together?

641
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:52,173
I just think about living.

642
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:57,883
I want to live as opposed
to I don't want to die.

643
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:05,784
That, and I keep telling myself,
everybody's gonna make it this time.

644
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:10,590
We both know what could
happen here, Sergeant.

645
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:28,080
Safety off.
Right.

646
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:04,212
All right. Wake up.

647
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,981
Wake up. Wake up.

648
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:09,657
All right, already.
Come on. Get up.

649
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:11,923
Come on.

650
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:13,153
Look...

651
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:15,926
here's the deal.

652
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,060
Those men that came in here,
they're still outside.

653
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:24,600
And I have no idea
how many there are...

654
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,608
or what
they're prepared to do.

655
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,871
Don't sweat it, man.
There's nothing you can do.

656
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:31,935
You can't stop
Bishop's people.

657
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:35,016
Go ahead, Sergeant. Tell them.

658
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,384
They're not Bishop's people.

659
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:44,355
They are police officers.
What? Po-po popping each other?

660
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:46,424
That's the fuckingest
shit I ever seen.

661
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:49,088
This shit
ain't Smiley's fight, man.

662
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:52,098
Let Smiley go, man.
Let me go.

663
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:54,663
Shit, I totally
figured it out.

664
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,395
Assassination politics, right?

665
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:01,598
By your government-sanctioned thugs
abusing their authority again, man?

666
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,907
Who's gonna save us from your
corrupt brethren, Sarge? You?

667
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,140
You?

668
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:14,354
I'm gonna do my best to protect
you. All right? All of you.

669
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:16,891
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
I feel real safe, man.

670
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:10,868
Oh, shit.

671
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:21,713
Fuck.

672
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:24,850
Fuck!

673
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,646
What the fuck is going on now?

674
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:12,101
Get down!

675
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:24,308
Fuck.

676
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:26,547
What happened
to the fucking window?

677
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:30,519
Cover the front.
All right.

678
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,124
I'll be right back!

679
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,630
The window, Sergeant! The window!
Look out! Look out! Shoot him.

680
00:52:56,173 --> 00:53:00,052
Shoot him again, man! Shoot him
again. Shoot him! He's not dead!

681
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,754
Man down. Denied entry.

682
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:22,672
You gotta get us out of here, man.
Smiley feels very fucking unsafe.

683
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:23,767
It's scary.
I'm scared to death.

684
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,642
You can't leave us here like
fucking live bait, man. Come on.

685
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,909
Think about it. We're hostages.
Please, don't leave us here.

686
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:29,882
I know. They could come
for us. Come on, man.

687
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,475
Come on. You can't do
that. Think about it.

688
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,815
Can't leave us here,
man. Please. Come on, man.

689
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,515
You can't leave us here as fucking
animals to fucking die. Come on.

690
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:39,583
Smiley's scared shitless, man. Please. We're
nothing. We're sitting ducks here. Please.

691
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:42,220
Come on. Don't leave us like this, man.

692
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:09,781
All right, choose a weapon.
Anything you see.

693
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:16,855
Tell me again why we should help
your little, skinny, white ass?

694
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,922
'Cause if you don't,
you'll die.

695
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,140
No resistance.
Advancing to the front door.

696
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:29,733
<i>We're going in.</i>

697
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:32,802
Spread out
across the precinct.

698
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:34,439
Stop anything
that approaches.

699
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:37,951
We might make it through this night.
Christ Almighty. What are you doing?

700
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:40,317
You can't trust these people.
What the hell are you doing?

701
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:43,357
You're supposed to be covering
the front. God damn it!

702
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,029
Come on.

703
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:43,247
430.

704
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:54,956
13,760.

705
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:57,963
25, 027.

706
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:00,901
All right.
J ust hold the front.

707
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:03,064
And don't move this time!

708
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:16,906
Million,
three hundred thirty...

709
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:20,110
thousand,
five hundred and eight.

710
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:43,699
You fucker!

711
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:48,978
I can't believe you make me your
defendant, you son of a bitch!

712
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:51,615
Make me set bail.

713
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,021
You all right?

714
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,723
I feel better. I'm better.

715
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:18,903
Shit, I got mine, baby.
Oh, yeah.

716
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:28,651
Oh, yeah.

717
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:37,396
Come on, you motherfuckers.
Come on. Run.

718
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,837
Come on.

719
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:23,903
Come on. Yeah.
There you go, secretary.

720
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:46,266
Jesus Christ.

721
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:48,735
All right.
They're pulling back!

722
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:50,827
You all right?

723
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:51,929
He saved me.
She's fine.

724
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:55,840
Yo, there is nobody out there in the
front. Them motherfuckers running scared.

725
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:59,175
All right. I drove them
back, baby. I drove them back.

726
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:01,647
We're gonna have a red-raw
revolution on our hands, man.

727
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:04,116
All right. Good job.
Good job. Good job.

728
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,878
Maybe they'll leave
for fucking good now.

729
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:07,751
They're not going anywhere.

730
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,051
Put that goddamn weapon down.

731
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:14,117
Old man, you do not wanna
point that weapon at me.

732
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:16,990
That is not
a bright thing to do.

733
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:21,296
Put that goddamn weapon down slowly,
then back away from it, all of you.

734
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:24,070
Jake, get their weapons.
Take their weapons.

735
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:27,733
Ain't this a bitch. We saved your
asses. Now you wanna turn on us?

736
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:31,210
Yeah, well, thank you for that, sweet
cheeks. Now, put your weapon down.

737
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:35,146
The problem is outside, not
inside. Put the gun down, Jasper.

738
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:37,946
No. You know what the problem is?
That we criminals got rights, baby.

739
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:41,044
That's right. We got
rights to be protected...

740
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:43,146
against assault under any
circumstances. That's right.

741
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:45,783
And if you can't provide that,
well, fuck you, we will.

742
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:47,122
You're a fucking psycho.

743
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:50,721
Jesus Christ, Jake. What? Are
you gonna trust these freaks?

744
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:54,799
The first chance they get to blow our brains
out, they'll try to make a break for it.

745
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:57,098
They need us
as much as we need them.

746
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,765
We all gotta start trusting
each other, right now...

747
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:02,332
if we're gonna make it
through this night.

748
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:04,438
Put the gun down, Jasper.

749
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:11,115
Put the goddamn gun down.

750
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,126
What?

751
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:40,578
Shit. I fucking knew it.
All right.

752
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,808
All right.

753
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:44,016
Now, let's all introduce
ourselves to each other.

754
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:46,815
It's New Year's Eve.
Let's turn over a new leaf.

755
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,724
All right. Well, let's not
all fucking speak at once.

756
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:56,286
The name's Smiley.
And I'm a Libra, and...

757
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:00,597
I'll handle these jokers...

758
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:05,103
you handle your people, maybe
we get out of here tonight.

759
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,472
He armed his prisoners.

760
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:16,181
It's a smart play.

761
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:19,776
Must be at least eight guns
in there now.

762
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:25,381
J ust a couple hours till the sun's
up. If we can't breach, what do we do?

763
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:30,130
Get the AV-5 here.
Are you sure about that?

764
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,461
Yep. I'm not
taking any more chances.

765
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,601
It's gonna take a while
in this weather.

766
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:37,027
Marcus?

767
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:40,433
What the fuck do we do
if it doesn't arrive in time?

768
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:43,533
We'll have to think of some
other way of ending this.

769
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:48,743
You either flirting with me or clocking
my game 'cause you don't trust me.

770
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:53,083
I don't like your beady little eyes all
over my goodies, so turn the fuck away.

771
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:59,283
You're manipulative, weak knees,
and that sexy copper complexion.

772
01:01:59,615 --> 01:02:02,755
You're definitely an Aries,
baby. You're pretty good.

773
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:04,863
Smiley thanks you.

774
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:08,598
You and me got something
in common, you know that?

775
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:11,967
'Cause you coming down
off some shit, ain't you?

776
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:14,999
Don't be ashamed, man.
Don't be ashamed.

777
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,543
What's your poison?

778
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:21,171
Seconal to bring me down.
Adderall to bring me back up.

779
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:24,749
You gotta get up to get down.
Oh, yeah, baby. Oh, yeah.

780
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:28,186
All right. That's enough. I mean,
come on. Let's pay attention.

781
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:30,553
I want a cigarette so bad.

782
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:33,083
Stupid New Year's resolutions.

783
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:39,323
Hey, gangster,
you make any resolutions?

784
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:43,468
What do you think, secretary?

785
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,300
Oh, my God. I can't
stop thinking about sex.

786
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:55,410
I mean, I usually think about
sex a lot, but this is crazy.

787
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:58,076
Well, sex and death
are very closely related.

788
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:03,547
The Greeks called it Eros
and Thanatos, love and death.

789
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,828
Or sex as a way of
nullifying thoughts of dying.

790
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:13,164
What's your deal, gangster, huh?
You actually been shot five times?

791
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:21,399
Six.

792
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,239
You really
pull a man's spine out?

793
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:29,375
It was an Adam's apple.

794
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:36,454
You ever get
into a tussle, secretary...

795
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,456
you grab a man by his throat.

796
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:45,263
Dig it? And then you squeeze.

797
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:51,663
I guarantee you he will drop. He
will not get up for quite some time.

798
01:03:57,033 --> 01:04:00,070
Oh, God. It's really quiet
out there now.

799
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:04,975
Yeah.

800
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:10,983
That's what worries me.

801
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:14,457
We're not gonna make it
till morning.

802
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:15,859
Marcus Duvall
will not allow it.

803
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:18,864
We've got eight people
covering six entry points.

804
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:20,900
If we work together, all
right, we will make it.

805
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:23,460
Look at it this way.
That's me out there.

806
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,596
You think I'd let you
survive until the morning?

807
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:29,609
We don't have a lot of options here.
Well, we got to figure something.

808
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:34,378
'Cause I'm not gonna stay here
all night, waiting to get killed.

809
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:38,443
If you use the situation to try
and escape, it's about me and you...

810
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:40,816
'cause when this is over,
you're going back to jail.

811
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,414
Relax, Sergeant.
Relax.

812
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:46,419
This ain't about me
and you. Not yet.

813
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:50,520
Our shit's on pause, huh?
Yeah. Our shit's on pause.

814
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:54,298
You saved my ass back there.

815
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:56,831
Why?

816
01:04:56,926 --> 01:05:00,134
Everyone in here is my
responsibility. It's my job.

817
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:04,704
That's noble. U nfortunately,
I don't share the sentiment.

818
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,405
I see a cop in jeopardy,
he's on his own...

819
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:12,676
unless it benefits me
to jump in for the save.

820
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:15,779
Listen. I don't
try to be anything I'm not.

821
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:18,825
That ain't gonna change.
I don't care what day it is.

822
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:21,024
You remember that, Sergeant.

823
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:24,120
Hey. Someone's coming.

824
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:35,599
Oh, God. It's Capra, Sarge!

825
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:40,137
You know this guy? He's
a cop. He works here.

826
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:41,703
They'll execute him.

827
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:44,843
Capra!

828
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:54,361
Yeah. Drive. Drive!

829
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:57,286
Oh, my God.
He's gonna make it.

830
01:05:57,353 --> 01:05:59,162
He still has
to get by the sniper.

831
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:00,756
Come on, Capra!

832
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:15,205
He's still moving.
They didn't get him yet.

833
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:18,316
What... Where are you going?

834
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:26,990
Come on. Come on.

835
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,662
Come on!
Come on, Capra!

836
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:37,062
Come on!

837
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,572
What the fuck is going on?

838
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,209
Who's fucking shooting
at us, Sarge?

839
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:52,945
Who the fuck
are all these people?

840
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:56,150
What are you
doing here, Capra?

841
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:58,284
What are you doing here?

842
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:01,054
It's New Year's Eve.
I knew you'd be here alone.

843
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:02,721
I came to have a drink
with Iris.

844
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:06,130
Oh, God. You picked the wrong night
to make your move, baby, believe me.

845
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:08,395
You know,
that's really sweet.

846
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:12,734
That's really sweet, but, unfortunately,
I don't believe a fucking word of it.

847
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:17,073
Put that goddamn weapon down,
you psycho. He works here.

848
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:19,670
I don't care that he fucking works
here, man. He could be a plant.

849
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:24,013
No, Jasper. Put the gun down, all right?
Let's not start that again, all right?

850
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:27,679
He comes here in the guise of courting
that lady. It's a fucking ingenious plan.

851
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:29,085
They get one of their boys
in here...

852
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:31,591
and then take us out one by
one by one. Come on. Tell them.

853
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:33,148
They shot at him.
Oh, yeah.

854
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,489
All right? They shot at him.
Yeah.

855
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,256
Oh, but they conveniently
fucking missed, didn't they?

856
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:37,990
The act is a fucking charade.

857
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,589
Come on. Tell them.
He's fucking right, Anna.

858
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:42,499
Isn't it a fucking
charade? Do I have a gun?

859
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:44,661
Do I have a fucking gun?
I can't hurt you.

860
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:46,262
That's not fucking
good enough, rat-bitch.

861
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:49,365
Come on. J ust lock him up, man, so
he doesn't do any damage. Come on.

862
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:52,139
Come on, Roenick. Listen to me,
man. We're not locking this man up.

863
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:54,908
Not in my precinct, all right?
I vouch for him.

864
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,543
Okay.

865
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:00,581
Okay, but I'm fucking sorry...

866
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:02,952
but your authority has been
super-fucking-seded. You understand?

867
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:04,923
You're not in charge anymore.

868
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:08,457
Right, Bish? Bish, tell them.

869
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:11,254
He could be one of them, man,
and so fucking easily.

870
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,231
You don't think
we see right through you?

871
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:14,495
Can't fucking
believe that shit.

872
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:17,094
Comes in here playing
that game, playing stupid.

873
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:18,831
You don't think we know?

874
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:21,465
Right, man? Let's do the math.

875
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:26,038
Come on. Let's put him away,
man, just play it safe, you know?

876
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,273
Put it down.

877
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:30,541
No, no, no. Come on.
Come on, man. Come on.

878
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:34,178
J ust do the math. Come on. Motherfucker
comes in like that, playing...

879
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:50,499
Come here. Sergeant Roenick
is in charge. U nderstand?

880
01:08:55,364 --> 01:08:56,672
Yes.

881
01:08:58,467 --> 01:08:59,877
Let's go.

882
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:07,450
Only because I respect you.

883
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:11,283
But I still say this shit is fucking
illogical bullshit, all right?

884
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:13,759
He may not be who he says he
is. J ust mull that shit over.

885
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:16,057
Think it over.
Think it over, man.

886
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:24,494
Iris, look after Capra. Fill
him in on what's going on.

887
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,098
All right, Capra? J ust be cool,
so no one else here gets spooked.

888
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:30,974
Everybody else,
back to your positions.

889
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:42,412
Thank you. Don't. That
was self-preservation.

890
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:45,584
The more men we have,
the better chance we stand.

891
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:49,286
Are you sure you vouch
for this man? I do.

892
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:53,461
Come with me.

893
01:09:56,625 --> 01:10:00,868
You know, I hate to admit it, but Smiley
agrees with what you said back there.

894
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:04,009
Smiley want a fucking medal?
Hear me out, man.

895
01:10:04,066 --> 01:10:07,877
Look, we're out of our shackles for what?
The last time in the next 15, 20 years?

896
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:10,314
All right, man. Get to the
point. What do you want?

897
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:13,785
Listen to me, man. Look out that
window. That's freedom, baby.

898
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:15,510
Get what I'm saying?

899
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:20,718
Look, maybe this New Year's can bring
something different for us after all.

900
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:22,818
Beck like Smiley now.

901
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,097
Eight months ago he loses his
team when a deal goes sour.

902
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:28,225
Problem with drugs and
alcohol since the incident.

903
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:32,169
A burned-out cop. Only a matter
of time before he drops his guard.

904
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:36,976
Watch the truck.
They'll eye it as a way out.

905
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,174
What's the word on the AV?

906
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:43,376
Storm's starting to let up,
so it shouldn't be long now.

907
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,011
Good.

908
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:55,760
Someone gets inside,
takes off, goes for help.

909
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:59,330
That's too obvious.
We'd need a distraction.

910
01:10:59,388 --> 01:11:02,164
We also need the keys. Your cop
said he dropped them in the snow.

911
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:04,135
I could
hot-wire a car.

912
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:07,430
I thought you never committed
a crime in your life?

913
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:09,600
I haven't.
Oh, yeah.

914
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:12,975
J ust picked up some shit
along the way. Hold on.

915
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:16,347
How do we know she's not just gonna drive
out of here and leave us all here to die?

916
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:19,476
Who the fuck are you,
Miss Fucking Little Skirt?

917
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:22,180
Shake that skinny ass
in somebody else's face.

918
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:26,157
Okay, Anna. No offense, but I'll
feel better if somebody goes with you.

919
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:31,359
Maybe I should go. I promise I'll
make her get some help. Scout's honor.

920
01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:38,737
It's either me or Jasper.
Can't be.

921
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:42,441
We need your guns. It's gotta be... Me.

922
01:11:46,702 --> 01:11:48,909
Me.
You?

923
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:57,516
Shoot.
Hey, I'll go. I'll do it.

924
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:01,627
What? It's the only thing
that makes sense, right?

925
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:04,289
Whatever. Whatever the fuck
ever. Let's just do this. Come on.

926
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:05,661
Me and the doc.

927
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:08,627
Fine. Okay.

928
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:10,426
What?

929
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:14,038
It's the right move,
Sergeant. I know that.

930
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:16,371
All right.
I'm the doctor, right?

931
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:17,774
Right. You can handle that? Yes.

932
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:20,108
You can? I don't know. I don't know.

933
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:23,573
But I have to try, okay? No. No.

934
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:28,346
Please. I have to go.

935
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:30,549
I have to do it.

936
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:36,252
Shit!

937
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:43,860
Hey!

938
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:48,265
Those two skels are bugging out,
just like I told you they would.

939
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:51,367
They torched the bus
for a diversion, I guess.

940
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,438
Come on!

941
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:03,080
Jesus. They're gonna get themselves
killed. They're dead already.

942
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:08,225
We can use this.

943
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,369
Very smart.

944
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:20,133
They knew we'd expect them
to make for the car.

945
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:23,736
Freedom, baby. We did it.
Yeah. I told you.

946
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:26,744
Happy New Year. Now, how are we
gonna get the fuck out of here?

947
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:29,373
Visual on two men. No shot.

948
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:33,783
Moving to a better vantage.

949
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:42,653
Hey.

950
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:45,595
You sure you wanna do this?

951
01:13:47,656 --> 01:13:49,066
Yeah.
All right.

952
01:13:57,533 --> 01:13:58,739
Shit!

953
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:01,804
They're fucking shooting!
Where'd they hit you, man?

954
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:03,144
On my shoulder.

955
01:14:03,705 --> 01:14:06,708
Let's go. Come on. Let's
haul ass now. Okay. Okay!

956
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:08,151
Go.
You go.

957
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:27,037
All right. Come on.
Come on, baby. Come on.

958
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:30,940
This was not the plan, man.
This was your idea.

959
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:33,206
Come on. We're so
fucking close. Come on.

960
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:34,542
I think I can still make it.

961
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:36,446
Come on, man. You can do it.

962
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:39,080
On target.

963
01:14:46,081 --> 01:14:49,653
36, 45, 54, 63,
72, 81, 90, 99...

964
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:53,861
Come on, man. What am I gonna
do? What am I gonna do, man?

965
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:56,024
Don't make me
go at this alone.

966
01:14:56,558 --> 01:14:58,332
Target two locked.

967
01:14:58,427 --> 01:15:02,375
No shot. Have position,
but no shot.

968
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:04,267
36, 45...

969
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,335
What the fuck's up with that
multiplication table shit, bitch?

970
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:08,107
Fuck you!
It's freaking me out.

971
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:10,172
You couldn't hot-wire my ass!
You're a liar!

972
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:11,274
Liar?

973
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,581
I will bite your little
white head right the fuck off!

974
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:17,555
63, 72, 81, 90!
9, 18, 27, 36, 45...

975
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:19,719
What is taking so long?

976
01:15:21,783 --> 01:15:24,957
I'm gonna make it for you,
man! I'm gonna do this for you!

977
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,847
72, 81, 90, 99...
Damn, motherfucker!

978
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:46,911
What did I tell y'all?

979
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:04,165
What'd I tell you?

980
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:06,296
You and your sergeant boyfriend,
y'all ain't believe me.

981
01:16:06,361 --> 01:16:09,239
What? Sergeant boy. That's
your boyfriend, right?

982
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:13,210
No.
Yeah.

983
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:17,513
They made it. They're clear!

984
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:21,920
We made it! We made it!

985
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:03,029
The skels are dead.

986
01:17:10,592 --> 01:17:12,901
We don't have
a goddamn chance, do we?

987
01:17:17,766 --> 01:17:19,802
Sarge. Sarge!

988
01:17:19,868 --> 01:17:22,871
God fucking damn it, the five
of us can't hold them back.

989
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:25,680
They're gonna take out
each and every one of us.

990
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:27,880
What are we supposed
to do, Sarge?

991
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:31,885
What are we supposed to do?

992
01:17:33,515 --> 01:17:35,722
What the fuck
are we supposed to do?

993
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:42,830
I don't know.

994
01:18:05,881 --> 01:18:08,020
What do you wanna do, Marcus?

995
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:15,832
How many inside?

996
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:26,740
A hundred.

997
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,041
Answer the question.

998
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:47,422
You're a brave woman.

999
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:02,372
What do you want to do
with the body, Marcus?

1000
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:07,019
Bishop's men were responsible
for all this, remember?

1001
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:12,319
Let's get this thing done.

1002
01:19:30,165 --> 01:19:31,666
Time's up, Sergeant.

1003
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:33,604
Last stand.

1004
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:37,015
Your gun would be appreciated.

1005
01:19:44,412 --> 01:19:45,947
Why did I let her go?

1006
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:53,526
I know a lot
about dying, Sergeant.

1007
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:57,433
There are two ways
you can handle it.

1008
01:19:57,893 --> 01:20:01,033
With the self-pity
or without it.

1009
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:04,006
Fuck you.
Get out of my office.

1010
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:11,607
I see you've made
your decision.

1011
01:20:58,386 --> 01:20:59,830
Sun's almost up.

1012
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:02,391
Whatever Duvall's gonna do,
he's gonna do now.

1013
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:04,960
We need to get ready,
or we'll be trapped.

1014
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:06,936
Who the fuck asked you?

1015
01:21:07,662 --> 01:21:10,642
You know, I've had all the shit
I'm gonna take from you, old man.

1016
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:14,203
Hey, fuck you, dealer.
No.

1017
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:17,111
Fuck with me.

1018
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:19,648
I should've fucked with you... Enough!

1019
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:22,217
Bishop's right.

1020
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:26,591
Jasper, you just watch the
front here. Iris, the cell block.

1021
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:30,659
Capra, you're on.
Take the back stairs.

1022
01:21:31,353 --> 01:21:34,527
Bishop and I'll roam, covering
all the other entrances.

1023
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:36,253
Hey.

1024
01:22:39,854 --> 01:22:42,561
What were you doing by the
back door? What were you doing?

1025
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:43,966
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1026
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:48,439
I saw you. What did you tell them?
Why didn't you let them inside?

1027
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:52,236
What's the plan?

1028
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:56,179
What's going on? You were
wrong. He's working for Duvall.

1029
01:22:56,771 --> 01:22:59,478
He removed the handcuffs
from the back door.

1030
01:23:01,343 --> 01:23:03,447
What's the plan? Answer me!

1031
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:04,849
Fuck!

1032
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:09,218
I'm a fucking police officer. I
don't have to fucking answer you.

1033
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:14,155
What's the plan, officer?

1034
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:18,660
Oh.

1035
01:23:19,461 --> 01:23:22,567
So it's about you and me now,
huh, Sergeant?

1036
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:25,773
It's not about me
and you. Not yet.

1037
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:28,878
What were you doing
by the back door, Capra?

1038
01:23:28,937 --> 01:23:30,177
It wasn't me, Jake.

1039
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:32,274
What's the plan?
I wasn't there.

1040
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:34,979
We let him live once.
He almost got us killed.

1041
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:38,123
We let him live twice,
we deserve to die.

1042
01:23:40,949 --> 01:23:43,929
You and I are friends, Jake.
You gonna do this to me?

1043
01:23:44,819 --> 01:23:48,027
What is the plan?
There is no fucking plan!

1044
01:23:48,089 --> 01:23:49,898
Don't make me
fucking kill you.

1045
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:53,234
What the fuck are you doing
to him? Listen. They're coming!

1046
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:58,736
<i>AV-5 getting into position.
Ten seconds to target.</i>

1047
01:24:21,856 --> 01:24:25,132
What the fuck are they doing
up there? What do you think?

1048
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:42,319
Save your ammo.

1049
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:44,288
We don't know where they are.

1050
01:24:45,847 --> 01:24:47,348
We need to make
a move outside.

1051
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:52,387
That's what they want us to do.
Yeah. They'll pick us off, one by one.

1052
01:24:54,489 --> 01:24:58,164
Jake, I found a way out.
Down in the basement.

1053
01:24:59,027 --> 01:25:00,836
All right, Iris, Capra.

1054
01:25:10,405 --> 01:25:11,679
All right. Go.

1055
01:25:12,907 --> 01:25:15,046
Bishop, I need you.

1056
01:25:22,517 --> 01:25:23,893
Come on.

1057
01:27:02,317 --> 01:27:06,265
It's an old sewer tunnel. Why
didn't you mention it before?

1058
01:27:06,754 --> 01:27:09,632
I didn't think of it.
We've been a little bit busy.

1059
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:14,200
I don't even know
where it goes.

1060
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:16,435
Of course, we can
always stay here.

1061
01:27:17,632 --> 01:27:20,112
It doesn't matter.
Good job, Jasper.

1062
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:34,088
Okay. We need to move. The fire
department will be here soon.

1063
01:27:57,372 --> 01:27:58,578
There it is.

1064
01:28:23,531 --> 01:28:26,511
All right. It's all clear.
Everybody up.

1065
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:37,687
Come on, Jasper.

1066
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:49,129
Thanks.

1067
01:28:50,191 --> 01:28:52,933
Son of a bitch! Jake! All right. Now...

1068
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:56,775
me and the secretary are going bye-bye.
You don't follow, she don't get hurt.

1069
01:28:56,831 --> 01:29:00,506
You lower your weapons, gentlemen,
we can end this on a happy note.

1070
01:29:05,873 --> 01:29:07,443
My apologies, secretary.

1071
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:09,317
Apology not fucking accepted.

1072
01:29:09,377 --> 01:29:12,551
Hold it right there. Drop
your fucking weapons right now.

1073
01:29:12,947 --> 01:29:14,391
Down, motherfucker! Down!

1074
01:29:14,449 --> 01:29:15,859
Damn it!

1075
01:29:17,485 --> 01:29:18,793
Get down!

1076
01:29:24,926 --> 01:29:26,871
How the hell
did they find us?

1077
01:29:45,847 --> 01:29:50,022
Oh, my God. It was Jasper at the back
door. You set us up, you motherfucker!

1078
01:29:52,353 --> 01:29:55,060
You just killed us, Jasper.
No, fuck you, Jake!

1079
01:29:55,356 --> 01:29:56,596
God damn it! I told you...

1080
01:29:56,657 --> 01:30:00,127
"J ust let them have the son of
a bitch. Nobody else gets hurt. "

1081
01:30:00,595 --> 01:30:03,473
'Cause I ain't dying
for that piece of shit.

1082
01:30:07,802 --> 01:30:09,508
Or for you either, Jake.

1083
01:30:11,038 --> 01:30:12,778
I thought you were a cop.

1084
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:18,818
Go in the truck, Jas.
You don't need to see this.

1085
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:27,995
Bishop, you
should've taken that deal.

1086
01:30:34,796 --> 01:30:37,674
These men aren't cops,
Sergeant. They're criminals.

1087
01:30:38,032 --> 01:30:40,944
They're killers, just like me.
Ain't that right, old man?

1088
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:44,744
Yeah, that's right.
That's right.

1089
01:30:44,806 --> 01:30:47,809
You're goddamn right,
you son of a bitch!

1090
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:49,978
Not with your weapon.

1091
01:30:59,987 --> 01:31:03,491
Give me a clean piece. God
damn it! Give me a clean piece!

1092
01:31:03,558 --> 01:31:04,900
Close your eyes.

1093
01:31:06,394 --> 01:31:07,804
Let him finish it.

1094
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:14,379
Shit! Get down.

1095
01:31:20,408 --> 01:31:22,717
The truck! The truck!
The truck!

1096
01:31:32,687 --> 01:31:33,756
Go.

1097
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:46,137
Get them.

1098
01:32:53,034 --> 01:32:55,537
You breathing? Good. Okay.

1099
01:33:00,107 --> 01:33:04,111
Oh, fuck. J ust act
like you're dead, okay?

1100
01:34:07,008 --> 01:34:08,782
Motherfucker!

1101
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:11,150
Fuck you.

1102
01:34:16,417 --> 01:34:17,827
You fucking bitch!

1103
01:35:48,943 --> 01:35:50,319
Hello, Sergeant.

1104
01:35:51,946 --> 01:35:53,789
What the hell
are you still doing here?

1105
01:35:54,181 --> 01:35:56,126
Marcus Duvall still lives.

1106
01:35:57,251 --> 01:35:59,162
For me, this is unacceptable.

1107
01:36:00,154 --> 01:36:02,566
So our shit's back on pause.
Is that it?

1108
01:36:06,794 --> 01:36:08,000
Yeah.

1109
01:36:12,533 --> 01:36:13,943
We have a problem.

1110
01:36:15,302 --> 01:36:18,180
Duvall and his men can see us.
We can't see them.

1111
01:36:23,444 --> 01:36:25,287
I'll draw their fire.

1112
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:29,058
Their muzzle flashes'll
give away their position.

1113
01:36:31,352 --> 01:36:32,831
Don't miss, Bishop.

1114
01:36:34,021 --> 01:36:35,500
Run fast, Sergeant.

1115
01:37:10,291 --> 01:37:12,828
Call Roenick.
Who's Roenick?

1116
01:37:16,897 --> 01:37:19,309
H urts like a bitch,
doesn't it?

1117
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:22,204
Call Roenick.
Tell him I'm dead.

1118
01:37:22,736 --> 01:37:26,775
You know me, Marcus.
I cannot tell a lie.

1119
01:37:30,544 --> 01:37:31,784
Look at you.

1120
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:36,787
When I first approached you 10 years
ago, you couldn't look me in the eye.

1121
01:37:37,818 --> 01:37:40,594
One of them nervous,
God-fearing types.

1122
01:37:41,288 --> 01:37:43,791
Now you put a bullet in me,
no hesitation.

1123
01:37:44,758 --> 01:37:47,738
You're quite the changed man
this New Year's, Marcus.

1124
01:37:48,395 --> 01:37:51,239
Now, for the last
fucking time, call him.

1125
01:37:51,298 --> 01:37:52,777
He doesn't have to.

1126
01:37:53,968 --> 01:37:55,572
Drop your weapon.

1127
01:38:08,182 --> 01:38:10,355
What are you waiting for? Shut up!

1128
01:38:10,417 --> 01:38:13,727
Put the gun down, Duvall. What
are you gonna do? Shoot me?

1129
01:38:14,021 --> 01:38:16,831
Arrest me?
You gonna kill a cop?

1130
01:38:16,991 --> 01:38:18,731
There's only one cop here.

1131
01:38:19,126 --> 01:38:22,334
Now put the goddamn gun down.
You're caught.

1132
01:38:22,396 --> 01:38:24,739
How many more people
are you gonna kill tonight?

1133
01:38:24,798 --> 01:38:26,470
As many as it takes.

1134
01:38:28,402 --> 01:38:30,142
You make me fucking sick.

1135
01:38:33,974 --> 01:38:37,177
Fuck!

1136
01:39:17,184 --> 01:39:19,095
So it's about that time, huh?

1137
01:39:22,823 --> 01:39:24,529
Looks that way, don't it?

1138
01:39:27,761 --> 01:39:28,762
Yeah.

1139
01:39:29,363 --> 01:39:30,705
Well, thanks.

1140
01:39:31,932 --> 01:39:35,277
For what?
You didn't call my name.

1141
01:39:36,603 --> 01:39:39,913
That was self-preservation,
Sergeant, and it worked.

1142
01:39:41,475 --> 01:39:43,477
I told you.
I'm not gonna change.

1143
01:39:43,544 --> 01:39:47,583
You try to follow me, you'll
find out just how true that is.

1144
01:39:48,349 --> 01:39:50,294
You're not gonna get very far.

1145
01:39:50,718 --> 01:39:51,958
I'll manage.

1146
01:39:55,356 --> 01:39:56,425
Well...

1147
01:39:57,291 --> 01:40:00,033
you take care
of yourself, Sergeant.

1148
01:40:01,462 --> 01:40:02,804
I will find you.

1149
01:40:07,067 --> 01:40:09,740
No other cop. J ust me.

1150
01:40:19,313 --> 01:40:20,382
Jesus.

1151
01:40:23,751 --> 01:40:24,957
Sarge?

1152
01:40:31,892 --> 01:40:34,963
Sarge? Sergeant.

1153
01:40:35,029 --> 01:40:37,668
Yeah, Iris.
Oh, Christ. Look at you.

1154
01:40:37,731 --> 01:40:40,609
It's okay. I told these firemen what's
up. They're not leaving us alone.

1155
01:40:40,667 --> 01:40:43,409
Not for a second. Okay?
All right. Help me up.

1156
01:40:48,976 --> 01:40:50,921
We have some questions
for you, Sergeant.

1157
01:40:50,978 --> 01:40:54,015
Yeah, well, I'd like to get
this wound looked at first.

1158
01:40:54,915 --> 01:40:56,553
Anybody else out there?

1159
01:40:58,819 --> 01:41:02,892
No, man. There's nobody else.
J ust me and them.

1160
01:41:04,525 --> 01:41:07,699
Let me get you on a stretcher.
No. No, man. It's all right.

1161
01:41:07,761 --> 01:41:09,467
I'm walking out of here.

1162
01:41:15,936 --> 01:41:19,474
So do you think we have to show
up at the new precinct tomorrow?

1163
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:22,615
Shit. This is
fucking tempting.

1164
01:41:22,676 --> 01:41:24,951
No. Don't break
your resolution, huh?

1165
01:41:25,746 --> 01:41:28,226
Give me one.
I didn't make that promise.

1166
01:41:32,152 --> 01:41:35,360
You know, Sarge, I didn't
even recognize you tonight.

1167
01:41:36,223 --> 01:41:40,000
You were like a whole different bad
ass, motherfucker back there, huh?

1168
01:41:40,794 --> 01:41:42,500
You think so?
Yeah.

1169
01:41:42,563 --> 01:41:44,098
Well, get used to it.

1170
01:41:45,966 --> 01:41:47,570
Happy New Year, Sarge.

1171
01:41:48,305 --> 01:41:54,361
