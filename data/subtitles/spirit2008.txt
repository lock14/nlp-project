1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,200
Denzil Joy is a powerful man.

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,309
Powerfully evil.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,669
Need you here! Can't cope on my own.

4
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:12,150
Ready to chuck in the towel, lass.
Not up to this deliverance lark.

5
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:14,109
Somebody's falling from the tower.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,760
Someone you've lost who's
so powerfully in your mind.

7
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:20,989
My father. Died in a car crash.

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,629
Who's this Angela, anyway?

9
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:26,469
She's a good person. A nice person
and one who's been helping me.

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,190
- Did you shag him, then?
- We just talked.

11
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,989
About him being chosen as Boy Bishop.

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,350
I saw a little girl recorded on video.

13
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:35,350
Pawed and manipulated.

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,149
I put my own daughter into care,

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,109
to get her away from him.

16
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,280
- You're not going anywhere!
- I am NEVER coming back here.

17
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,879
Oh, shit.

18
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,299
Hey. Let me go in first.

19
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,979
Try the diplomatic approach.

20
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,879
Yeah?

21
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,509
I want to speak to Jane, please.

22
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,830
No way.

23
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,870
I'm not here to cast blame.

24
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,909
OK? I just want to resolve this.

25
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,949
Her mother is going mad with worry.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,280
I'm not bothered about her
mother. I'm bothered about her.

27
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,229
- Are you?
- What's that supposed to mean?

28
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,670
I'm saying, secrets don't do you any good.

29
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:32,789
No, they don't do YOU any good because
you want to be in control of me.

30
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,150
- I care about what happens to you.
- No, you want to control me.

31
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:39,270
Keep me. Have me all
to yourself. I know you.

32
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,920
But what if I said you DID have me?

33
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,670
- That you couldn't keep
your hands off me? - Rowenna.

34
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,199
Would that make you get the hell
out of my face for once in your --

35
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,629
- Jane! - You can't
come in. - Where is she?

36
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,590
- She doesn't want to see you.
- Out of the way.

37
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,629
Jane, where are you, love?

38
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,879
Jane?

39
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,069
I've come to get you.
Come to take you home.

40
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,750
- Nothing else matters.
- I've got nothing more to say to you.

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,669
- Merrily. - No. - Just go away.

42
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:11,189
Merrily. Hey, come on. Merrily.

43
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,629
Come on. Hey, let's go.

44
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,789
Don't worry. It's going to be all right.

45
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,270
I've just sneaked back for a crafty
look because it's niggling me.

46
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,159
Why did they choose this church?

47
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,159
Why now?

48
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,039
Hm... Nobody reported adverse or
negative feelings of any kind?

49
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:48,240
Apart from the bride's nerves, no.

50
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:52,629
There were tears. Tears are
a good sign at a wedding.

51
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,310
- It means you know it went well.
- And the Christening?

52
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,500
Oh, joyous. Quite joyous.

53
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,909
Why do you ask?

54
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,389
Well, let's just say
that not every exorcism

55
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:05,180
removes 100% of stubborn household...

56
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:11,229
Oh, I see. So this is a kind
of spiritual health check?

57
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,520
Well, MOT, more like.

58
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:18,839
- Which it seems to have passed without
so much as a broken sidelight. - Ah!

59
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,750
- What's this?
- Oh, it's our little claim to fame.

60
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,389
St Thomas Cantilupe, legendary
protector of Hereford Cathedral.

61
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,839
He was buried at Hereford
Cathedral but he was baptised here.

62
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:34,420
I often wonder if he
screamed the place down.

63
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:37,759
Most of them do. Babies, not saints.

64
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,230
- She's staying with this girl.
- Reverend Watkins, calm down.

65
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,269
No, I don't want to calm down. I
just want someone to do something!

66
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,590
Do what, exactly? Go round with some uniforms
and drag her back to the vicarage in handcuffs?

67
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,110
Excuse me.

68
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,620
Why is Denzil Joy's name up here?

69
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,709
Denzil Joy is Rowenna's father.

70
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,000
What?

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,189
She's the daughter that
Mrs Joy put into care?

72
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,829
- Why didn't I know this? - Been
trying to dig up all we can about the
Joys but the records are incomplete.

73
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:12,389
- I just want Jane out of there.
- Let's speak to Rowenna.

74
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:16,750
If she's the girl in the video, she might be
able to help us identify the other people.

75
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,199
And lead us to Sayer's killer.

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
OK. I'll be there.

77
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:36,550
Babes, I've got to go into town.
Can I get you a taxi to Angela's?

78
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,590
I'm OK here.

79
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,029
No, you're not.

80
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,870
What if the Christian Fellowship
of fucking up your life come back?

81
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,920
Get your coat.

82
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
You going to be OK?

83
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,939
Denzil Joy is her father.

84
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,189
Jane.

85
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,949
We'll sort things out.

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We'll get her back.

87
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,120
You know about Denzil Joy?

88
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,720
I sat by his hospital bed,
praying for his immortal soul.

89
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,360
But I keep seeing him.

90
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,269
In spite of the fact that he's dead.

91
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,120
I see him in my home.

92
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,560
My church.

93
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:52,829
We are conducting a murder inquiry
and we are exploring various avenues.

94
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,909
We're well aware of what you've
been through and we certainly don't
want to compound that in any way.

95
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,670
It's all right. It was a long time ago.

96
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,629
If you're not up to speaking about this...

97
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,819
No, I'm fine. Fire away.

98
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,379
OK.

99
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,600
Right...

100
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,939
Does this place mean anything to you?

101
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,240
What about this man?

102
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,860
Do you remember the
name Paul Sayer at all?

103
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,149
I don't remember anything about that time.

104
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,399
I think my brain helped
me by making me forget.

105
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,819
Is that you?

106
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,199
I don't know. I don't have any
photographs of me as a child.

107
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,579
Do you recognise any of these people?

108
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,949
Look at this one.

109
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Do you recognise the man
with the scar down his chest?

110
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,459
Why exactly did you return
to Hereford when you did?

111
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,310
I wanted to be with my
father in his last hours.

112
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,480
I thought it was my duty as his
daughter to be at his side.

113
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,779
I hadn't seen him for years.

114
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,779
This was my last opportunity.

115
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:52,519
OK. I'm going to draw this
interview to a close now.

116
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,669
One last thing.

117
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,509
I understand that Jane Watkins is
staying at your place at the moment.

118
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,669
Yeah. Her mum's giving
her a really hard time.

119
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,110
Thought it'd be good to give
them both a bit of space.

120
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,159
It's no big deal.

121
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,629
You and your mum have had a terrible time.

122
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:14,960
I hope you can both put it behind
you now that your dad has passed on.

123
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,440
She did a really brave thing back then.

124
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,389
Oh...

125
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,039
Poor lamb. You look completely
frazzled. Come on. Come on inside.

126
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,509
I was hoping you'd come
back, now he's gone.

127
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,389
What did you tell them? The police.

128
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,350
I didn't tell them anything
because I don't know anything.

129
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,389
What about ten years ago?
What did you tell them then?

130
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,710
Enough to send me away from my dad?

131
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:20,029
To destroy my life. That's what
you did. I was seven years old.

132
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,590
- I'm...
- Sorry?

133
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:25,909
No, you're not. You might be sorry
for yourself but you don't give a
shit about me. You never did.

134
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,990
I loved you! You're my baby.

135
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:31,039
Don't lie to me!

136
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,269
- You abandoned me.
- I had to!

137
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,710
If I'd have gone too
he'd have found us both.

138
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:39,990
I stayed so that you could be free

139
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,840
and now he can't hurt anybody any more.

140
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,669
No! No! No! No!

141
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,750
Argh!

142
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,799
Argh! Argh! Argh!

143
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,879
You can't have him.

144
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,509
He belongs with me.

145
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,320
- You're not going anywhere!
- I am NEVER coming back here.

146
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,549
She's working for someone called Angela.

147
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,080
I don't know what's going on but
there's something not right about
that woman. I don't trust her.

148
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,840
She's just down at the bottom.

149
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,070
Can I speak to Jane, please?

150
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,070
- Good evening, madam. Have you booked?
- Can I speak to Jane, please?

151
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,629
Jane isn't here. Very pleased
to meet you, by the way.

152
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,830
- You might not be when I've said
what I have to say. - Oh. Why's that?

153
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,549
I'm less than happy with the ideas you've
been putting into my daughter's head.

154
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,950
- Perhaps you should sit down and have a drink.
- I don't want a drink.

155
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,230
And what is your connection
with Rowenna Napier?

156
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,909
- Or should I say Rowenna Joy?
- Is that her name? I had no idea.

157
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,549
I met them both in a pub
one day and we got chatting.

158
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,509
It's as simple and obviously
hard to accept as that.

159
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:11,789
No. What is hard to accept is that a woman, a
complete stranger, would befriend a young girl.

160
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,830
We happen to have a lot in common.

161
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:17,070
- Oh (!) - And these ideas you
say I'm filling her head with,

162
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,870
she's looking for something and I'm
pointing her in the right direction.

163
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:23,389
By giving her messages from her dead dad?

164
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,590
I'm helping her to come to
terms with her feelings.

165
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,720
Don't claim to be doing good
because I know you're not.

166
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,029
Good and bad being your
expertise, of course.

167
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,190
Your calling making you feel
extra special in the world.

168
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,840
No wonder your husband called you
an... What was it he called you?

169
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
A pious bitch.

170
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:52,440
Thank you... Thank you... Thank you...

171
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,950
Oh, sweetheart.

172
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,509
I know you're feeling awful about
what's happened with your mum.

173
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:43,029
But things happen for a reason.

174
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,759
And sometimes the worst things
can turn into the best things.

175
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,080
- You'll see.
- Thank you.

176
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,679
I didn't know what to do. I...

177
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,950
Fate has brought him back to us.

178
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:40,840
Even in death he wants to play a part.

179
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,419
And he will.

180
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,210
I just... I need some time off.

181
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:04,769
I haven't been coping well with...
erm... ecclesiastical matters.

182
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,409
I don't think I even unlocked
the church this morning.

183
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,649
Merrily, if you have personal
matters to deal with,

184
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,570
as far as I'm concerned,
everything else can go on hold.

185
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,490
And if you're not up
to speed in a few days,

186
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,080
I'll parachute in a locum tenant.

187
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:23,460
- Thank you.
- Of course.

188
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,700
It's important you put Jane first.

189
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
I just feel a failure.

190
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,539
My job and... my marriage.

191
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:40,370
I'm pretty sure that's nonsense.

192
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,559
- Right. About the other
night. I... - Please.

193
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,929
Merrily, it was... I was wrong.

194
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,539
No, no. No. It's just...

195
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,090
I sometimes think I'm not
capable of a relationship

196
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:05,139
because I will just
muck it up and... and...

197
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:08,529
I'm sure that's not true either.

198
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,820
You're busy so I should just
leave you to... erm... do that.

199
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:22,289
Will you be at the Boy Bishop ceremony?

200
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:27,490
I know you have other priorities
but I would love to see you there.

201
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:29,539
Yeah.

202
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,340
Erm... Right, you've got
to get your strength back.

203
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:55,259
It's like a virus, this.
It's depleted you.

204
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,360
Thomas Cantilupe is the key.

205
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,450
None of this is coincidence.

206
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,009
You, Dobbs, the crucified man,

207
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:09,089
sacrifice in the church. All
roads lead to Tommy Canty.

208
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,849
We need to do some digging.

209
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,900
You do some digging.

210
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,099
Or go to the police.

211
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:22,650
This is far too serious to be wasting
time on people with closed minds.

212
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,650
- I don't want to know about that.
- Well, you have to know about it

213
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,529
because you're part of it.

214
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,180
- I just want my daughter.
- Oh...

215
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,299
I know this is hard for you.

216
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,220
God knows...

217
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:46,539
But if you're weak, you're in danger.

218
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,740
And so is she.

219
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:57,019
Sit down. I've asked you to come in
early so I can have a private word.

220
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,539
You've had a serious
accusation against you.

221
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,500
- Of sexual misconduct.
- Rowenna.

222
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:10,769
You deny it, I presume?

223
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:14,289
Look, the last time I saw her,

224
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:18,289
her behaviour was...
inappropriate, massively.

225
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:22,089
And what's more, she threatened
me with an allegation --

226
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,369
If that's true, why the hell
didn't you tell me about it?

227
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,890
Because I didn't want
to get HER into trouble.

228
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:34,049
Look, Rosemary, I swear, you need
to look into her case history.

229
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:37,410
OK? Speak to Barry Ambrose in Salisbury.

230
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,660
Ask him about Hilary Pile.

231
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:45,210
OK. This is ridiculous. You
know this is complete bollocks!

232
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:47,809
You know that I have to go
through the right procedures.

233
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:51,369
If this blows up into a firestorm,
it won't do you any favours either.

234
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,609
- Which means what?
- You know what.

235
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:58,059
I'll reassign your caseload and for
the time being, you're suspended.

236
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,250
Hi.

237
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:20,690
Hi. This is for Jane. It's
just to say that I love her

238
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,849
and I'm here when she
wants to come back and...

239
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,299
No... No pressure.

240
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:31,170
It's just... Could you deliver it to her?

241
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,609
I don't know if I can.

242
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,859
- You're her social worker.
- I'm not any more.

243
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:39,019
She's bloody stitched me up.
I'm going to lose my job.

244
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,539
That girl is...

245
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,880
I don't know what she is.

246
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:49,339
I'm so sorry.

247
00:19:52,579 --> 00:19:55,680
I don't want you to get
into any more trouble.

248
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:01,160
Last thing I want. I'm sorry.

249
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:05,599
What the hell? Give it here.

250
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,480
Thanks.

251
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,220
So, what have you got?

252
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:38,339
An expert. And on our doorstep.
Come on, leave the car.

253
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:43,089
Amongst all our medieval manuscripts,

254
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,539
this one is the most precious.

255
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,380
Thomas Cantilupe.

256
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,900
Bishop of Hereford in
the late 13th century.

257
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,890
Died abroad on the way back
from Rome to see the Pope.

258
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,170
As was the custom, the body
was boiled to remove the flesh

259
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,369
and the bones brought back to Hereford,

260
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,450
where they began to attract pilgrims.

261
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,369
Thousands of them.

262
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:10,299
Then... the miracles began.

263
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:13,250
The crippled could walk,
the blind could see

264
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:14,849
and when news of the cures spread,

265
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,650
it became the most important
shrine in the west of England.

266
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,099
Put our comparatively
remote cathedral on the map.

267
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,970
You could say after St Thomas Cantilupe
and the pulling power of the shrine,

268
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:28,089
it's never looked back.

269
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:32,460
Tommy Canty. Guardian and
benefactor of Hereford.

270
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,980
Must have been a mightily good man.

271
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:39,049
Very much so.

272
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:41,569
And it didn't stop when he died.

273
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,210
Sorry, what do you mean?

274
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:46,730
Well, you know about the demon?

275
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:58,500
One of the best known legends.
Also one of my favourites.

276
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:03,019
Supposed to have happened in
1290, ten years after his death.

277
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:08,380
A demon in all his unholy glory
appeared in Hereford Cathedral.

278
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:12,009
The terror-stricken congregation
prayed to no avail to be rid of it.

279
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:16,660
Then, in desperation, they appealed
to St Thomas Cantilupe to save them.

280
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,410
Which he did.

281
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:23,980
By battling the demon
and sending it packing.

282
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,730
So...

283
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:30,980
.. do you want to see him?

284
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:46,019
When they started restoration work
on his tomb, they brought him here.

285
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,259
It's not often our archaeologists
get the chance to examine a saint.

286
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,640
They removed his bones from the cathedral.

287
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,440
How could we have been so stupid?

288
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:07,569
This is what they want.

289
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,619
He's not in his tomb.

290
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:12,329
Not protecting the cathedral.

291
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,720
It's ALL about the cathedral.

292
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:22,369
They're planning something like...

293
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,220
.. the crow sacrifice times a thousand.

294
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,849
Something horrific.

295
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,569
A blow to the heart of Christianity.

296
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,289
Oh, I haven't worn that in years.

297
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:59,079
I knew it would look fabulous on you.

298
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,059
Here. Take this. It'll help
keep you calm and focused.

299
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:13,769
Hi. I've got something to give Jane.

300
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,500
Erm... There was no-one at
Rowenna's. I asked at the bistro.

301
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:21,779
- They told me where to find --
- I'll give it to her.

302
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,700
No. I will, thanks.

303
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:29,900
Jane, your mum's really worried about you.

304
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,799
Well...

305
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,660
If you want to open it, open it.

306
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,140
- A demon.
- Well...

307
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,609
It's too biblical.

308
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,660
I prefer squatter.

309
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:41,769
Call it evil in residence.

310
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:44,900
Whatever it was, it threatened
the cathedral in 1290.

311
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,329
What, you think it'll be threatened again?

312
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:53,059
Yes. And this time they've made sure
Thomas Cantilupe is no longer protecting it.

313
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,319
Hold on a minute. You...

314
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,849
You believe any of this?

315
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,890
That's not the point.

316
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,740
The important thing is that THEY
do and they believe it fanatically.

317
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,569
You actually think something
demonic will manifest?

318
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:12,089
Evil manifests itself every day.

319
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:15,569
Every hour, lass. Just a
question of what form it takes.

320
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:17,569
People fly planes into buildings,

321
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:21,529
people walk into schoolyards
carrying samurai swords.

322
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,569
That's the truly demonic.

323
00:26:23,619 --> 00:26:25,619
Evil.

324
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,529
You have to picture the cathedral
not just as bricks and mortar

325
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:41,140
but the accumulated force of
centuries of prayer and devotion.

326
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:47,450
It's like one vast psychic engine

327
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:52,700
but one that can be stopped in its
tracks if people's faith is shaken.

328
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:58,970
If Hereford Cathedral is forever
defined by an awful event,

329
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:01,890
then the place will be a spiritual ruin.

330
00:27:04,339 --> 00:27:09,849
That's the poison that them playing for the
other side want to inject into the system,

331
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,440
to corrode it and destabilise it.

332
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:16,170
- Hello?
- "Merrily.

333
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:21,369
I've just seen Angela walking into
the cathedral with Rowenna and Jane."

334
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,160
- I don't know what they --
- "Jane!"

335
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:28,059
"Hello?"

336
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,380
They've taken...

337
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,730
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

338
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:39,450
James, her boyfriend, is Boy Bishop.

339
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:46,900
On St Nicholas Day, the Bishop of
Hereford hands over power to the
Boy Bishop enthroned in his place.

340
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:50,460
So technically, on this day every year,

341
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:53,890
the cathedral is without
its spiritual head.

342
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,039
Today it will be more
vulnerable than ever.

343
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:15,759
- Get back inside.
- I'm coming with you.

344
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,220
You are not. Oh, get a bloody grip, lass.

345
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,890
Until you sort your own demons, you're
sod-all use dealing with anybody else's.

346
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,690
I am not taking a crippled
bloody gazelle to the water hole.

347
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,079
I'm going. They've got Jane.

348
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,460
You are prey, Merrily.

349
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,450
You always have been and they
use that crack in your armour.

350
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,130
Sean. You can't forgive
him. You know you can't.

351
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,170
- Right. I'll go in my own car.
- Oh...!

352
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,490
Listen... Listen... Listen.

353
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:53,450
Merrily, you are not ready.
Spiritually or mentally.

354
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,450
Well, I have to be. She's
my daughter. Are you coming?

355
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,500
Are you coming?

356
00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:04,220
Argh!

357
00:30:21,579 --> 00:30:22,779
Argh!

358
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,809
James, you have been chosen

359
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:10,660
to serve in the office of Boy
Bishop at this cathedral church.

360
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:14,369
Will you be faithful

361
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:18,730
and keep the promises made
to you in holy baptism?

362
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:20,779
I will.

363
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,170
What an honour and privilege it is

364
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,819
to stand here in the ancient
tradition of Boy Bishop of Hereford.

365
00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:49,930
But today I'm going to
break with tradition...

366
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,809
- I need to speak to Bishop Hunter.
- Hardly.

367
00:31:51,859 --> 00:31:54,809
- I'm going to ask somebody else
to address you... - It's important.

368
00:31:54,859 --> 00:31:58,490
- .. about what Christianity means to them.
- Wait till after the ceremony.

369
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:01,009
Oh, my God. I have to stop this.

370
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,779
- My name is Jane Watkins.
- Stop!

371
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:31,299
My mother's a vicar.

372
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:34,740
She made all the decisions
about me when I was growing up.

373
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:38,180
Including what I was
supposed to believe in.

374
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,650
I wasn't born Christian.

375
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,740
I wasn't born anything.
I was born a human being.

376
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:48,529
And what do I get?

377
00:32:48,579 --> 00:32:54,690
The stupid rules and ideas of a
church built on lies and hypocrisy.

378
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,970
She stands in the pulpit and
talks about love and forgiveness.

379
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:04,210
And she's not capable of
either of those things herself.

380
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:06,259
Jane.

381
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:11,980
Jane. These aren't your words,
love. I know they're not.

382
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,210
They are.

383
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:17,809
No, no. They're not. These are lies.

384
00:33:17,859 --> 00:33:23,660
These are lies to hurt me because
I have done things wrong and...

385
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,890
And... maybe you're angry about that.

386
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,130
Maybe I can't change
that but I so want to.

387
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,180
I hate you.

388
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,809
I hate you!

389
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:36,859
ARGH!

390
00:33:37,779 --> 00:33:39,779
Now. Now.

391
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,779
Eternal Lord God, who
created the holy angels...

392
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,920
Argh!

393
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,519
- Christ be with me. Christ within
me, Christ before me. - Bullshit!

394
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,099
Where's your god now, eh?

395
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,510
Why isn't he helping you, helping her?

396
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:35,030
Why aren't your prayers working?

397
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,150
Cos he abandoned you. He
abandoned you a long time ago.

398
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:40,869
He doesn't care about you!

399
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,269
I can see him holding the knife, Rowenna.

400
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,309
I can see your dad.

401
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,360
It's him doing this.

402
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,159
Not you.

403
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,989
You don't want to hurt her.

404
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:56,030
It's him.

405
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,599
Why would you want to hurt someone
who's shown you friendship?

406
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:08,110
Who's trusted you and loved
you? I don't understand.

407
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:10,349
You will. YOU'LL ALL UNDERSTAND!

408
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,940
You think this is an act of love?

409
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:17,599
I know deep down you hate him.

410
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,349
You always had to please him.

411
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,389
I know.

412
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,440
He's dead.

413
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:30,070
He's got to stay dead.

414
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:32,119
Not festering in you.

415
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:40,960
A good dad protects from harm.

416
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,079
You are not like him.

417
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,880
You don't have to do this, sweetheart.

418
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,760
Please let him die.

419
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,480
Let him die.

420
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,280
Fuse box.

421
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,829
I'm going to go with Rowenna.

422
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,480
Everybody in her life's already
given up on her. I'm not going to.

423
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,510
So, James Lydon is getting
counselling, apparently.

424
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:05,360
James Lydon is a bastard.

425
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:09,860
And Rowenna was a lying slag.

426
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,320
Yeah...

427
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,219
She's also a victim of something terrible.

428
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:29,079
Terrible.

429
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,349
It wasn't her fault.

430
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,590
She's in the best place to get help so...

431
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:36,110
Vicars are great at forgiveness.

432
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,079
Some are really bad at it, aren't they?

433
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,300
I do have really good memories, you know.

434
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,780
They just got lost in the...

435
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
.. the grief and...

436
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:59,159
.. the anger.

437
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,469
I really don't want to hate him
any more and I really love you.

438
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:06,550
And I'm really sorry and
I will give up my job.

439
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:10,309
- We'll go to Leeds. We'll do whatever you want.
- You've got to have a life, Mum.

440
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,159
You asked to do this job for a reason.

441
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,349
Oh, sweetheart!

442
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,400
I'm so sorry.

443
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
I'm so sorry.

444
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:44,179
Getting close to the CEO?

445
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,480
Something like that.

446
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,389
Sophie said you were here.

447
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,309
You might be up here having a quick fag.

448
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:03,139
I just always wonder,
Mick, why you chose me.

449
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,119
For this job.

450
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:12,639
Why replace a much more experienced
deliverance minister with a poodle

451
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,219
rather than a Rottweiler?

452
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,829
Was it because you thought
a woman might be weak?

453
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,599
You? Never.

454
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:29,349
Because the choice of Boy
Bishop must have come from you.

455
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,199
Do you know what? I called the museum.

456
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:36,070
They said you didn't just give
permission to move the bones.

457
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:38,320
You actually suggested it.

458
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,039
And then I wondered if you knew
a young girl called Rowenna

459
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,340
when you were Canon at Salisbury.

460
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,420
Ah.

461
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:52,679
Lovely Rowenna.

462
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:58,039
It's through her you met her
father and his... people.

463
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:02,630
Maybe that's what brought you to Hereford.

464
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:04,679
Mystics.

465
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,019
Thrill-seekers, dabblers.

466
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,480
Perverts.

467
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,920
They needed a coherent leadership.

468
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:22,360
We came so close to achieving so much.

469
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:29,750
You must have jumped for joy when a
newly widowed vicar moved into the parish

470
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,139
with a 16-year-old daughter.

471
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:36,119
Pity she cut short her sermon.

472
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,380
It was you that killed
Canon Dobbs, wasn't it?

473
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,269
I told him I would come to
pray with him and he let me in.

474
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,460
You crucified Paul Sayer.

475
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,079
We all did.

476
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:56,019
Christianity has run its course, Merrily.

477
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,719
Angela and the likes with their
superstitions don't change things.

478
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,469
They don't understand

479
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:09,150
that nothing can be achieved in this world

480
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:11,800
without seizing the reins of power.

481
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,480
Argh!

482
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:16,960
You don't have the power, not any more.

483
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,469
You'll go to jail.

484
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,519
You'll be found out.

485
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,269
The names of friends in high places.

486
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,480
You'll all be destroyed and
you will have destroyed it.

487
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:36,829
- Argh! - You've learnt
nothing, have you, Merrily?

488
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:42,159
Well, pride goeth before destruction
and a haughty spirit before a fall.

489
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,840
Proverbs 16, verse 18.

490
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:52,309
- And Angela Purefoy's
done a runner. - Oh.

491
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,429
Cleared out her bank account,
scarpered, apparently.

492
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:00,000
A network of like minds to help
them disappear into the woodwork.

493
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:05,389
Well, they're united in trying to
cause the church immeasurable harm.

494
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,440
The church survives.

495
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,559
- What will you do now?
- Oh...

496
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,190
Back to the Brecon Beacons.

497
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:18,980
Bit of desolation. Good for the soul.

498
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,110
I might pop in at the
cathedral on the way back.

499
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:25,909
Light a candle or two for Tommy Canty.

500
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,309
Now his bones are back
where they need to be.

501
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,440
- Yeah. Keeping the badness at bay.
- Fending off demons.

502
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,679
It's a funny old job, in't it?

503
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,480
Deliverance.

504
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,670
You stick at it, lass.

505
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:49,119
- The new bishop might not like me.
- Oh, he will.

506
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,079
Might not be a he.
