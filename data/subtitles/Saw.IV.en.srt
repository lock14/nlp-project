1
00:01:55,296 --> 00:01:57,563
Subject's name is John Kramer.

2
00:01:57,564 --> 00:02:01,037
52 year old. A male. Caucasian.

3
00:02:02,684 --> 00:02:04,196
I've seen better days.

4
00:02:43,673 --> 00:02:45,941
Some kind of backdoor brain surgery.

5
00:04:12,704 --> 00:04:14,438
Let's check the stomach.

6
00:04:32,297 --> 00:04:35,064
What the hell...

7
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:39,679
Get homicide here. Now!

8
00:04:47,943 --> 00:04:49,648
Where is it?

9
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:51,842
It's in his stomach.

10
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,216
Cut it out.

11
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,968
Are you there, Detective?

12
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:32,660
If so, you're probably the last man standing.

13
00:05:32,661 --> 00:05:36,938
Now, perhaps you will succeed where the others
have failed.

14
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:40,497
You think you will walk away untested?

15
00:05:40,498 --> 00:05:44,593
I promise that my work will continue.

16
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,802
You think it's over just because I'm dead?

17
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:51,763
It's not over. The games have just begun.

18
00:06:27,896 --> 00:06:28,593
Who's there?

19
00:06:30,164 --> 00:06:31,432
Talk to me.

20
00:06:32,341 --> 00:06:33,040
Talk to me!

21
00:06:46,813 --> 00:06:47,800
Talk to me!!!...

22
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:56,569
Stop it!

23
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,506
Stop...

24
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:07,095
Stop it!

25
00:07:36,178 --> 00:07:38,503
Who's doing this to me?!

26
00:07:53,213 --> 00:07:54,402
Just stay away from me!!!

27
00:08:00,693 --> 00:08:01,360
What'd I do?

28
00:09:26,951 --> 00:09:29,731
Right side clear. Left side clear.

29
00:09:29,732 --> 00:09:30,513
Clear.

30
00:09:33,997 --> 00:09:35,527
In position.

31
00:09:36,655 --> 00:09:37,354
Standing by.

32
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,877
Alright then.

33
00:09:41,584 --> 00:09:42,390
I See movement.

34
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:48,633
We have a device.

35
00:09:48,634 --> 00:09:50,837
You get eyes in there before you go in.

36
00:09:50,838 --> 00:09:51,701
Get some eyes in here.

37
00:09:52,944 --> 00:09:53,897
Moving now.

38
00:10:09,728 --> 00:10:11,278
Doorway's clear.

39
00:10:46,163 --> 00:10:47,446
It's Kerry! Shit!

40
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:48,500
Rigg, don't do that.

41
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:49,693
Rigg, I said no!!!

42
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:51,127
Kerry!!!

43
00:10:51,161 --> 00:10:51,962
Stop it!!!

44
00:10:51,963 --> 00:10:53,332
Do not go through that door.

45
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:55,051
Kerry!!!

46
00:10:56,036 --> 00:10:56,956
Shit...

47
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,372
Oh shit...

48
00:11:21,168 --> 00:11:22,472
Give me the Coroner's office.

49
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,110
Copy.

50
00:11:23,111 --> 00:11:24,667
Somebody get those rats off her.

51
00:11:35,454 --> 00:11:36,313
Cut her down.

52
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:38,800
You know I can't do that.

53
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:45,577
Just cut her down, please.

54
00:11:53,418 --> 00:11:55,265
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

55
00:11:56,386 --> 00:11:59,350
You know never to go through
an unsecured door, ever.

56
00:11:59,503 --> 00:12:01,242
Thought she was still alive.

57
00:12:01,243 --> 00:12:02,952
Thought I could save her.

58
00:12:04,896 --> 00:12:08,095
Did you ever think that we would've
end up here...when we first started?

59
00:12:10,436 --> 00:12:11,343
No.

60
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:14,910
Didn't see it happening like this.

61
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:19,051
Why the hell do we still do it?

62
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:20,433
It's in our nature to save them.

63
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,559
That's what we do.

64
00:12:22,656 --> 00:12:26,694
Right, cherish your life.

65
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,027
What?

66
00:12:28,027 --> 00:12:31,291
The fucking motto. We're supposed to
cherish our lives.

67
00:12:32,101 --> 00:12:35,081
But how the hell are we supposed to
do that when this is our life?

68
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:42,812
We chose this. You go home.

69
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:44,061
Hoffman, there are two agents here to see you.

70
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:44,663
Copy.

71
00:12:49,234 --> 00:12:50,588
- Detective Hoffman.
- Yeah?

72
00:12:51,047 --> 00:12:54,895
I'm Special Agent Lindsey Perez. This is
Special Agent Peter Strahm.

73
00:12:55,726 --> 00:12:57,545
How can I help the FBI?

74
00:12:57,546 --> 00:13:00,361
We're here about Detective Kerry. She
was our liaison.

75
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,292
Open the door. You will find me.

76
00:13:02,871 --> 00:13:03,480
What?

77
00:13:09,347 --> 00:13:10,226
What's this?

78
00:13:10,227 --> 00:13:13,010
The key that came from our last
message from Detective Kerry.

79
00:13:13,011 --> 00:13:15,288
"Open the door and you will find me"
mean anything to you?

80
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:15,865
No.

81
00:13:24,565 --> 00:13:26,005
Where's the body?

82
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:29,806
Crime scene photographer's flash
picked up this bullet casing.

83
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,039
It was lodged between the body
and the device.

84
00:13:32,073 --> 00:13:33,205
Run it for prints.

85
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,786
Give us a minute would you?
Thanks.

86
00:13:48,965 --> 00:13:50,233
The lock was open.

87
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:51,757
She couldn't get out.

88
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:55,795
It was constructed for her execution.
It betrayed the rules.

89
00:13:55,797 --> 00:13:57,265
Not a Jigsaw trap then.

90
00:13:57,395 --> 00:13:57,771
No.

91
00:13:58,445 --> 00:13:59,898
Amanda Young, the accomplice, did this.

92
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:00,954
This wasn't done by Amanda Young.

93
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:02,487
Excuse me?

94
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:07,254
Detective Kerry weighed approximate 130lbs.
Amanda Young's arrest report has her at 107lbs.

95
00:14:07,255 --> 00:14:08,600
She couldn't get her up there alone.

96
00:14:08,601 --> 00:14:08,889
John Kramer was.

97
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,074
Bedridden cancer patient?

98
00:14:10,075 --> 00:14:11,035
He's brains. Not brawn.

99
00:14:11,036 --> 00:14:13,636
He was also an engineer. He could've
rigged pulley's that...

100
00:14:13,637 --> 00:14:15,705
...or. Someone else could've helped him.

101
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:19,336
Special Agent, if you're here for any other
reason than just to assist.

102
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,853
We're here to find the person your
department couldn't, Detective.

103
00:14:21,854 --> 00:14:23,882
The one helping Jigsaw and Amanda Young.

104
00:14:25,106 --> 00:14:25,950
Excuse me.

105
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,173
We found a harlequin doll in your possession.

106
00:14:34,197 --> 00:14:35,432
What's that about?

107
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:36,338
A toy.

108
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:38,336
Kids play with toys during the holidays.

109
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:41,079
How about the tricycle?

110
00:14:42,793 --> 00:14:45,259
The tricycle's from John's youth...

111
00:14:45,293 --> 00:14:47,334
A grown man has a tricycle his whole life?

112
00:14:48,257 --> 00:14:50,570
I'm sure you've kept things that
were important to you.

113
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:55,578
Look, Ms. Tuck. Is there any reason we should
be concerned with your safety?

114
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:58,247
Perhaps, you should be more
concerned for yourself.

115
00:14:58,248 --> 00:15:01,513
Why don't you tell me everything you know about
John and let's start at the beginning.

116
00:15:01,547 --> 00:15:03,924
John's life defines genius.

117
00:15:05,745 --> 00:15:08,575
So, why don't we start at the end and
let's work our way backwards.

118
00:15:08,672 --> 00:15:09,920
I represent Mrs. Tuck.

119
00:15:13,173 --> 00:15:14,222
She knows something.

120
00:15:14,223 --> 00:15:18,098
I thought you were going home.
You have vacation time, right?

121
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:19,059
Take it.

122
00:15:19,734 --> 00:15:22,178
Finish the remodeling. Spend
some time with Tracy.

123
00:15:22,178 --> 00:15:23,138
She understands.

124
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:24,747
Then, don't take it for granted.

125
00:15:25,481 --> 00:15:27,194
Eric is still out there man.

126
00:15:27,195 --> 00:15:30,056
Eric's been missing for six months. Kerry
was gone for four days.

127
00:15:30,057 --> 00:15:32,890
I can only be as optimistic as the facts allow.

128
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,149
Yeah. Well I'm in it until I find him.

129
00:15:34,155 --> 00:15:35,893
Finding his body's not going to vindicate us.

130
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,728
Finding him alive will.

131
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,624
It's time to let go.

132
00:15:39,868 --> 00:15:41,061
I want you to go home.

133
00:15:42,118 --> 00:15:44,294
I'll call you later to make sure
everything's okay.

134
00:15:49,237 --> 00:15:50,512
Who's he?

135
00:15:50,513 --> 00:15:52,336
Lieutenant Rigg, our SWAT commander.

136
00:15:52,337 --> 00:15:53,539
What's his problem?

137
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,350
Everyone around him keeps dying.

138
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,042
What's it say?

139
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:27,397
It says I tried calling you four times. It says dinner is
in fridge and at the bottom it says I love you.

140
00:16:28,524 --> 00:16:35,638
I need to help my mom for a few
days. Just come with me.

141
00:16:36,901 --> 00:16:38,536
No, I can't.

142
00:16:40,123 --> 00:16:43,802
You can but you won't.

143
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:49,905
What you can't do is save everyone.

144
00:16:58,615 --> 00:16:59,301
Tracy...

145
00:17:00,592 --> 00:17:02,418
Tracy, please listen to me...

146
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:18,604
John Kramer owned a company called
The Urban Renewal Group.

147
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:20,855
No irony in that, huh?

148
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:22,496
What was Rigg watching?

149
00:17:22,497 --> 00:17:25,567
Jill Tuck's interrogation.
She was Jigsaw's ex.

150
00:17:25,568 --> 00:17:26,349
It's old.

151
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,392
Why's a SWAT guy watching that?

152
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:34,299
What's wrong? I really think we should tell Hoffman
what Detective Kerry said in her last message.

153
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,908
She said two officers might be in danger but
until we know who we're not causing any panic...

154
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:42,440
If Detective Hoffman or anyone else in this precinct
is in danger I think they should know it.

155
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:43,505
Not your call.

156
00:17:47,406 --> 00:17:48,735
Making any progress?

157
00:17:51,633 --> 00:17:52,611
We're fine. Thanks.

158
00:17:53,404 --> 00:17:55,647
Hey Ross. Looks like another doctor went
missing from the hospital.

159
00:17:55,648 --> 00:17:57,088
You think maybe its uh...

160
00:17:57,089 --> 00:17:58,541
...Connected? Let's check it out.

161
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:02,504
If you need me, call my cell. Coffee
machine's around the corner.

162
00:18:02,505 --> 00:18:03,318
Boy or girl?

163
00:18:04,094 --> 00:18:04,385
Girl.

164
00:18:04,898 --> 00:18:06,284
I didn't know you were married.

165
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,195
I'm not. It's a short story, believe me.

166
00:18:26,051 --> 00:18:26,686
Tracy?

167
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:43,217
Tracy?

168
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,457
Yeah?

169
00:19:50,842 --> 00:19:52,499
The print off that casing.

170
00:19:52,884 --> 00:19:54,051
We got a match.

171
00:19:54,052 --> 00:19:55,012
Jesus.

172
00:19:55,589 --> 00:19:56,512
Rechecked this?

173
00:19:56,513 --> 00:19:57,465
Twice.

174
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,693
Hello, Officer Rigg.

175
00:20:38,078 --> 00:20:39,810
Welcome to your rebirth.

176
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:45,550
For years, you stood by and witnessed as
your colleagues have fallen.

177
00:20:45,647 --> 00:20:50,176
You have remained untouched while
Eric Matthews has disappeared.

178
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,915
But with your survival came your obsession.

179
00:20:53,228 --> 00:20:57,300
Obsession to stop those around you from
making the wrong choices.

180
00:20:57,301 --> 00:21:00,288
Thus, preventing you from making the right ones.

181
00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:01,960
You wanted to save everyone.

182
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:05,645
Tonight, I give you the opportunity to face your obsession.

183
00:21:05,706 --> 00:21:10,193
Look closely. Eric Matthews is still alive.

184
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,875
The block of ice he stands upon on is melting.

185
00:21:14,984 --> 00:21:17,508
He has but ninety minutes to save himself.

186
00:21:17,906 --> 00:21:21,578
Detective Hoffman's fate is linked to Eric's survival.

187
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,448
Heed my warning, Officer Rigg.

188
00:21:24,482 --> 00:21:28,426
Their lives hang in the balance of your obsession.

189
00:21:28,427 --> 00:21:32,014
Will you learn how to let go
and truly save them?

190
00:21:32,015 --> 00:21:34,182
The choice is yours.

191
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:27,308
Take off the mask and put your hands in the air.

192
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:29,535
I can't remove...

193
00:22:41,265 --> 00:22:46,549
Officer Rigg, your first test. The person in front
of you is in desperate need of help.

194
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,710
But it is not your job to save them.

195
00:22:48,744 --> 00:22:52,992
You view this person as a victim but
if you were to see what I see.

196
00:22:53,281 --> 00:22:57,650
Beneath the mask lies a criminal
undeserving of the life she leads.

197
00:23:03,413 --> 00:23:09,978
Your obsession tells you to save the victim,
I tell you to walk away. The choice is yours.

198
00:23:12,156 --> 00:23:12,915
Are you a cop?

199
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:13,646
What?

200
00:23:13,646 --> 00:23:14,606
Are you a cop?!

201
00:23:14,607 --> 00:23:15,663
Yeah. I'm a cop.

202
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,089
What is that?!!

203
00:23:20,378 --> 00:23:21,607
What're you doing?!!!

204
00:23:27,757 --> 00:23:28,706
Get me out!!

205
00:23:30,111 --> 00:23:31,108
They're in the gears.

206
00:23:31,238 --> 00:23:32,110
What's in the gears?

207
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:34,004
Combination. Get me out!

208
00:23:37,198 --> 00:23:39,921
Just get me out!

209
00:23:39,922 --> 00:23:40,882
Alright. Relax!

210
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:41,843
Hurry!

211
00:23:43,101 --> 00:23:44,716
Just get me outta here, please!!!

212
00:23:48,738 --> 00:23:50,680
Please. Where are you going?!

213
00:23:55,253 --> 00:23:55,950
Shit.

214
00:23:56,993 --> 00:23:58,192
Stop!!!

215
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:27,777
Shit.

216
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:35,663
I got one.

217
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:38,004
I got one!

218
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,549
Hold on. Hold on.

219
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,702
Hurry!!!...

220
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:49,644
Hold on. Hold on.

221
00:24:50,148 --> 00:24:51,553
I got it, 617.

222
00:24:51,554 --> 00:24:52,400
617!

223
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:09,011
Ok, listen. Stay here.

224
00:25:09,306 --> 00:25:10,408
Don't touch anything.

225
00:25:32,415 --> 00:25:33,186
What the fuck...

226
00:25:36,405 --> 00:25:37,606
What the fuck you doing?

227
00:25:37,607 --> 00:25:39,856
What you doing? Drop the
fucking knife...

228
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:41,800
Put the knife down.

229
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:43,030
Put the knife down!

230
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,368
I just saved your fucking life!

231
00:25:58,968 --> 00:26:00,823
The prints just came in. They're from
Officer Rigg.

232
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,176
- Fisk...
- Not now.

233
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,690
We just got a call. A shot's fired from 23 Park Place.

234
00:26:06,071 --> 00:26:07,390
That's Rigg's apartment.

235
00:26:15,133 --> 00:26:18,230
Hello, Brenda. I want to play a game.

236
00:26:19,017 --> 00:26:21,011
An officer will try to save you.

237
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:25,312
If he is successful, then your game begins.

238
00:26:25,313 --> 00:26:30,119
This man will use these photos to sentence
you for your crimes.

239
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,524
And the only way to stop him is
taped underneath the TV.

240
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:40,741
Let him save your life and accept
your fate to rot in prison...

241
00:26:40,742 --> 00:26:44,704
...or kill him and guarantee your freedom.

242
00:26:45,275 --> 00:26:46,776
Make your choice.

243
00:27:49,416 --> 00:27:52,992
<i>I'll fucking kill you, you fucking bitch!</i>

244
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,432
It's started.

245
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:17,467
An APB's been issued for Rigg. Everybody's looking.

246
00:29:17,468 --> 00:29:18,901
He has a wife. Where is she?

247
00:29:18,901 --> 00:29:20,186
We haven't located her yet.

248
00:29:20,187 --> 00:29:21,073
Strahm...

249
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:24,839
Two detectives. You see this?

250
00:29:26,824 --> 00:29:28,315
- Hoffman. You got a 20 on him?
- Not yet.

251
00:29:29,263 --> 00:29:30,806
- Hoffman...
- Calling.

252
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,542
How do you explain Detective Matthews?

253
00:29:33,026 --> 00:29:33,828
He's alive.

254
00:29:33,829 --> 00:29:36,382
Six months, Jigsaw never kept anyone that long.

255
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:37,705
No one but Amanda Young.

256
00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:40,393
You think he's been fixed.

257
00:29:40,394 --> 00:29:42,633
Why these six?

258
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:48,935
Hoffman's a decorated lieutenant. He
doesn't fit the profile.

259
00:29:48,936 --> 00:29:51,131
That's what you see. But
what does he see.

260
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,637
Rigg tried to save his two friends.

261
00:29:54,638 --> 00:29:57,561
Maybe. We got names and locations
on any of these people?

262
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:58,260
Working it.

263
00:29:58,261 --> 00:30:01,535
This is overkill. It's a setup to
announce Rigg as the accomplice.

264
00:30:01,568 --> 00:30:02,773
Or a setup for his alibi.

265
00:30:02,966 --> 00:30:06,239
Everyone around him keeps dying but
where is he to tell us he's innocent..

266
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,451
...or what the hell these photos
are doing in his apartment.

267
00:30:08,485 --> 00:30:09,144
Look there.

268
00:30:11,723 --> 00:30:11,921
Move please.

269
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,420
Four walls build a home.

270
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:18,316
What does he want us to see on these walls?

271
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,481
The victims?

272
00:30:20,446 --> 00:30:22,112
One of these pictures doesn't belong.

273
00:30:29,688 --> 00:30:31,225
This is who we're looking for.

274
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,111
Lets talk to her now.

275
00:30:40,135 --> 00:30:41,696
Jill Tuck, where is she?

276
00:30:49,705 --> 00:30:52,278
Have them turn off the air in there.

277
00:30:59,746 --> 00:31:00,604
Ms. Tuck.

278
00:31:00,968 --> 00:31:03,797
I'm Special Agent Perez. This
is Special Agent Strahm.

279
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:06,179
I'd like to apologize for pulling you
out of your place at work.

280
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,910
What more do you think I can offer you?

281
00:31:08,224 --> 00:31:10,720
My hundred hours of interrogation tapes...

282
00:31:10,721 --> 00:31:14,766
...and the volumes of evidence taken
from my house weren't enough for you to understand John?

283
00:31:16,287 --> 00:31:19,715
Actually, it's not John we wanna talk
about, Ms. Tuck. It's you.

284
00:31:19,716 --> 00:31:23,347
Me? Why'd you wanna talk about me?
This isn't about me.

285
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:27,141
So stop wasting both of our time and get to
the real reason why you brought me here.

286
00:31:59,646 --> 00:32:01,103
I need help!

287
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,375
Hey!

288
00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:06,824
You hear me?!

289
00:32:07,977 --> 00:32:11,892
You fucking hear me, you fucking motherfucker?!

290
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,705
What the fuck are you looking at, huh?!

291
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:39,012
Hey, you!

292
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,176
Sir, sir, can I help you?

293
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:50,495
Hello, Officer Rigg.

294
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:54,136
In order for you to fully understand
my way, you must...

295
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:56,357
...Feel what I feel.

296
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:01,314
The photo before you is of a man in
desperate need of help.

297
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:05,799
In the next room are the tools to his salvation.

298
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,247
His life is in your hands.

299
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,047
But in the end, only he can save himself.

300
00:34:12,816 --> 00:34:16,988
Be careful. There are camera's watching.

301
00:34:18,237 --> 00:34:20,931
And you must hide your identity.

302
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:24,296
Make your choice.

303
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:31,755
Ok. Four walls build a home.

304
00:34:31,788 --> 00:34:34,970
- Care to shed any light on that?
- Light on what?

305
00:34:34,971 --> 00:34:37,513
On what your photos are doing at
the crime scene?

306
00:34:40,395 --> 00:34:42,620
Four walls build a home.
Ring any bells?

307
00:34:44,061 --> 00:34:45,751
Cherish your life?

308
00:34:47,864 --> 00:34:51,685
Cherish your life is the concept that
this whole clinic was built on.

309
00:34:51,686 --> 00:34:52,760
Cherish your life.

310
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:53,699
Your life.

311
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:54,749
That's his motto.

312
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:55,806
No. It's your motto.

313
00:34:56,406 --> 00:34:57,605
The clinic you run.

314
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:02,611
Fuck, man! I've been here for
three fucking hours!!!

315
00:35:02,612 --> 00:35:04,183
- Shut the fuck up!
- Shut up!

316
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,144
Hey, are you out of your fucking mind?!

317
00:35:10,769 --> 00:35:11,820
Stop it.

318
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:13,754
Stop it!

319
00:35:21,764 --> 00:35:22,939
You don't wanna do that.

320
00:35:23,169 --> 00:35:24,149
What the fuck's your problem?

321
00:35:24,182 --> 00:35:25,117
You're my problem.

322
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,492
And you're becoming everybody else's too.

323
00:35:36,103 --> 00:35:37,032
How do you feel?

324
00:35:38,377 --> 00:35:44,053
About a husband who takes a motto from your
drug clinic designed to help people...

325
00:35:44,054 --> 00:35:48,203
...and twist it into some manic torture mantra.

326
00:35:48,204 --> 00:35:50,603
That part of John has nothing to do with me.

327
00:35:54,233 --> 00:35:55,397
Look, Ms. Tuck.

328
00:35:55,398 --> 00:35:59,637
I just left a room with more blood on the walls
than paint, two officers are missing,...

329
00:35:59,638 --> 00:36:04,915
...and there's a growing pile of bodies in their wake
and every detail we unearth about your...

330
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:07,603
- ...hall of fame psychopath husband...
- Ex.

331
00:36:07,604 --> 00:36:12,672
...points to you as a possible accomplice.
I'm just curious as to why.

332
00:36:13,633 --> 00:36:17,568
You know there's a lot of people out
there looking for answers.

333
00:36:17,602 --> 00:36:22,647
Want to place blame on someone.
That person is you.

334
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,560
But you know what the best part is.

335
00:36:24,561 --> 00:36:28,227
I don't have to convince everybody.
Just 12 people.

336
00:36:31,483 --> 00:36:34,619
Ok, tell me about his workshop.

337
00:36:39,866 --> 00:36:41,899
Stay there.
Let me get the lights.

338
00:36:45,944 --> 00:36:47,268
- Wow, it's big.
- Yeah.

339
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:49,889
This is exactly what you've been looking for.

340
00:36:50,562 --> 00:36:51,608
Nice, huh?

341
00:36:52,473 --> 00:36:53,382
Tada.

342
00:36:54,055 --> 00:36:55,937
This is the clock?

343
00:36:56,418 --> 00:36:57,857
What's so special about it?

344
00:36:57,858 --> 00:36:59,735
Except for the fact the whole deal hung on it..

345
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:03,448
The mechanism inside is 300 years old.

346
00:37:04,217 --> 00:37:05,473
It's still ticking.

347
00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:07,600
It stood the test of time.

348
00:37:11,223 --> 00:37:12,781
Wait till you see this space.

349
00:37:18,982 --> 00:37:20,282
I got a surprise for you.

350
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:36,729
Why are you doing this?

351
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:39,400
Why?

352
00:37:44,437 --> 00:37:47,330
This was a mistake and it happened
a long time ago.

353
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:49,073
And I... I paid for this.

354
00:37:49,074 --> 00:37:51,346
Just let me go, okay?

355
00:37:54,674 --> 00:37:56,108
What's behind the door?

356
00:37:57,156 --> 00:37:59,577
One saves lives. One takes it away.

357
00:38:02,521 --> 00:38:03,549
Try and enter the door.

358
00:38:03,745 --> 00:38:04,525
Terrific.

359
00:38:09,734 --> 00:38:10,329
Oh no...

360
00:38:10,468 --> 00:38:11,188
Get back! Get back!

361
00:38:11,509 --> 00:38:13,224
Let's go. Go!

362
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:45,777
Eric...

363
00:38:46,771 --> 00:38:47,734
Jesus...

364
00:38:47,928 --> 00:38:49,638
Help, help me!!!

365
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:50,868
Get away from there.

366
00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:53,570
What do you know about the guy in the TV?

367
00:38:53,571 --> 00:38:54,187
What?

368
00:38:54,188 --> 00:38:55,231
What do you know about Eric Matthews?!

369
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,298
I don't know who that is.

370
00:38:59,022 --> 00:39:00,156
What the fuck is this?

371
00:39:00,445 --> 00:39:01,200
I don't know.

372
00:39:04,461 --> 00:39:05,699
What are you gonna do to me?

373
00:39:09,671 --> 00:39:15,692
If you are playing this tape, then you are one step closer
to truly understanding how to save a life.

374
00:39:15,693 --> 00:39:23,168
As an officer of the law, you find yourself torn. Is the man before you a victim? Or a perpetrator of violence?

375
00:39:25,025 --> 00:39:26,114
You sick fuck.

376
00:39:26,403 --> 00:39:28,735
His salvation is out of your hands.

377
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:34,913
It is your choice if you wish to put it into his own.

378
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:41,440
Once this lesson is learnt, you will find yourself one
step closer to truly saving Eric Matthews.

379
00:39:41,441 --> 00:39:46,938
Without you, this man's game cannot begin.
Force him into position to face his demon.

380
00:39:48,141 --> 00:39:50,341
And let him make the decision.

381
00:40:00,735 --> 00:40:01,967
What the fuck?

382
00:40:02,965 --> 00:40:04,251
Is this what you do in your spare time?

383
00:40:04,284 --> 00:40:05,022
No.

384
00:40:08,043 --> 00:40:09,331
Get on the fucking bed.

385
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:11,650
Get on the bed! Move!

386
00:40:16,711 --> 00:40:19,146
I don't know. I know I was wrong.

387
00:40:19,147 --> 00:40:19,662
I know.

388
00:40:22,084 --> 00:40:22,567
Hurry up!

389
00:40:23,186 --> 00:40:23,974
Hurry up!

390
00:40:24,071 --> 00:40:25,676
Put your fucking hands in.

391
00:40:27,771 --> 00:40:31,555
I don't know. Sir, untie me.

392
00:40:38,653 --> 00:40:40,416
What does that say?

393
00:40:54,601 --> 00:40:55,715
Hello Ivan.

394
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,655
As a voyeur, you have kept photos of
those you have victimized.

395
00:41:00,313 --> 00:41:01,564
Don't let him do this!

396
00:41:01,727 --> 00:41:03,629
Can you see the pain you have brought them?

397
00:41:04,526 --> 00:41:06,157
You have torn apart their lives.

398
00:41:07,093 --> 00:41:09,834
You've used your body as an instrument of abuse.

399
00:41:10,586 --> 00:41:14,482
Now I give you the chance to decide
what is more important.

400
00:41:15,244 --> 00:41:17,960
Your eyes which have led you blindly astray.

401
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:24,726
Or your body which has caused
those around you endless suffering.

402
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:28,612
You've been handed the tools
which can save your life.

403
00:41:28,811 --> 00:41:30,093
Decide quickly though.

404
00:41:30,286 --> 00:41:34,779
In sixty seconds, the choice will
be made for you.

405
00:42:14,474 --> 00:42:20,082
You're gonna have to tell me how you got
those bruises on your hand and your neck.

406
00:42:21,545 --> 00:42:23,893
Was this an accident or did
someone do this to you on purpose?

407
00:42:25,397 --> 00:42:28,213
You know you can stop it from
happening if you tell me the truth.

408
00:42:30,558 --> 00:42:31,767
Take a seat, please.

409
00:42:32,404 --> 00:42:33,815
I wanna go home now.

410
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,494
Son of a bitch is lying.

411
00:42:41,133 --> 00:42:43,076
He's done this before.
She's allowing it.

412
00:42:43,909 --> 00:42:45,625
The child's story doesn't corroborate.

413
00:42:45,659 --> 00:42:46,556
What can I do?

414
00:42:47,133 --> 00:42:49,239
Jane, can't let you go home
right now, okay?

415
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,733
You're going back to class now, honey.

416
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:54,553
Don't you officers sympathise these kids?
It's getting out of control.

417
00:42:55,383 --> 00:42:56,294
Take your hands off me.

418
00:42:56,295 --> 00:42:57,158
Hey, take it easy.

419
00:42:57,806 --> 00:42:59,490
Rigg! Rigg!

420
00:42:59,491 --> 00:43:00,388
No.

421
00:43:00,389 --> 00:43:02,552
Get out now!

422
00:43:02,553 --> 00:43:04,382
You just made the biggest mistake of your life.

423
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,575
You hear me!

424
00:43:10,665 --> 00:43:12,303
That's sweet, Ms. Tuck.

425
00:43:12,304 --> 00:43:14,838
But if you love the guy so much,
why leave him?

426
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:17,022
He left me long before I left him.

427
00:43:17,023 --> 00:43:18,599
Okay. People break up.
Relationships end.

428
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,717
It's called life.

429
00:43:19,718 --> 00:43:22,340
I mean, he started massacring people.

430
00:43:22,341 --> 00:43:23,493
Gideon meant everything to him.

431
00:43:24,245 --> 00:43:25,007
I'm sorry who?

432
00:43:25,717 --> 00:43:27,899
Do you know anything about the Chinese zodiac?

433
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,815
Aww, Jill. No, no.

434
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:33,427
I didn't just get pregnant.
It was carefully planned.

435
00:43:34,533 --> 00:43:36,152
Everything with John was.

436
00:43:39,991 --> 00:43:40,918
- See you.
- Thanks.

437
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:42,074
- Buhbye.
- Bye.

438
00:43:42,074 --> 00:43:44,027
- Let me get that for you.
- Thank you.

439
00:43:46,495 --> 00:43:48,854
-Thanks. You too. Good night.
- Good night.

440
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,496
Hey honey. You want some company?

441
00:43:56,497 --> 00:43:57,328
What are you doing?

442
00:43:58,984 --> 00:44:00,229
You know what this building is?

443
00:44:04,148 --> 00:44:05,090
It's a health clinic.

444
00:44:06,348 --> 00:44:08,258
You're a beautiful girl. Go home.

445
00:44:15,441 --> 00:44:18,352
I forgot my jacket.

446
00:44:18,385 --> 00:44:19,095
Cecil...

447
00:44:19,096 --> 00:44:21,015
Oh, please, please, Jill.
Jill, it's right there.

448
00:44:21,016 --> 00:44:23,423
It's right there. Please, please.
Come on.

449
00:44:25,223 --> 00:44:26,115
Thank you.

450
00:44:38,753 --> 00:44:39,395
What are you doing?

451
00:44:39,396 --> 00:44:40,478
I don't wanna hurt you, alright?

452
00:44:40,707 --> 00:44:42,157
You're gonna open that fucking door!

453
00:44:42,158 --> 00:44:44,154
Open that fucking door. Open it!

454
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:45,489
Open it...

455
00:44:47,337 --> 00:44:47,764
Fuck!

456
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:49,745
What fucking key?!

457
00:44:49,746 --> 00:44:50,574
What key?!

458
00:44:51,842 --> 00:44:52,560
Fuck!

459
00:44:55,577 --> 00:44:56,649
Fucking stay there.

460
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,478
Cecil?

461
00:45:40,569 --> 00:45:42,016
I need some help here.

462
00:45:42,518 --> 00:45:43,184
Orderly!

463
00:45:44,254 --> 00:45:45,854
This is my wife. She's pregnant.

464
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,746
How far long is she?

465
00:45:46,939 --> 00:45:47,813
7 months.

466
00:46:28,071 --> 00:46:29,879
All I wanted to do was help them.

467
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,008
You can't help them.

468
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,597
They have to help themselves.

469
00:46:47,524 --> 00:46:49,453
Okay. Let's review.

470
00:46:50,711 --> 00:46:53,910
Girl loves boy. Boy loves girl.
Boy gets girl pregnant.

471
00:46:54,084 --> 00:46:59,480
Girl loses baby. Boy turns
into a serial killer.

472
00:46:59,481 --> 00:47:01,956
Jill, I'm not buying it.

473
00:47:05,343 --> 00:47:06,861
Alright. She doesn't leave.

474
00:47:18,722 --> 00:47:22,795
Been identified as Ivan Landice.
Acquitted of rape three times.

475
00:47:23,429 --> 00:47:26,223
Had to gouge out his own eyes
in order to release himself.

476
00:47:27,651 --> 00:47:30,175
How does something like this get
into a motel room undetected?

477
00:47:30,541 --> 00:47:31,437
Piece by piece.

478
00:47:32,227 --> 00:47:35,560
The room's been rented for the past six
days to a lawyer named Art Blanc.

479
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,530
Get this. He went missing two weeks ago.

480
00:47:37,531 --> 00:47:38,937
We got his name. Get his addresses.

481
00:47:38,938 --> 00:47:42,477
Two out of five people in Officer Rigg's
apartment walls are dead.

482
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:45,657
Every partner he's ever worked with...
dead.

483
00:47:45,658 --> 00:47:47,011
Rigg didn't kill Ivan.

484
00:47:47,012 --> 00:47:48,331
Ivan made his own choice.

485
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:50,420
Isn't that the whole Jigsaw mantra?

486
00:47:50,421 --> 00:47:51,895
This wasn't about Ivan. It wasn't his test.

487
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,411
This is about Rigg.

488
00:47:55,419 --> 00:47:57,163
Look at these photos. Tell me
how you feel.

489
00:47:57,164 --> 00:47:59,689
- Look at these women and tell me how you feel.
- Angry.

490
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:00,230
Enraged.

491
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:01,128
Exactly.

492
00:48:01,948 --> 00:48:03,520
The pimp. The rapist.

493
00:48:03,521 --> 00:48:05,296
Jigsaw wanted Rigg to see what he sees.

494
00:48:05,297 --> 00:48:07,850
He wants him to feel what he feels.

495
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:10,673
This wasn't about Rigg saving his friends.

496
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:12,663
He's being recruited.

497
00:48:13,217 --> 00:48:14,073
Thanks.

498
00:48:14,696 --> 00:48:16,194
Art Blanc's got a bunch of properties.

499
00:48:16,195 --> 00:48:18,578
The last known address is a couple
of blocks from here.

500
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:27,339
- Right side clear.
- Left side clear.

501
00:48:28,096 --> 00:48:29,332
- Clear.
- Clear.

502
00:48:29,621 --> 00:48:30,354
Clear.

503
00:48:49,649 --> 00:48:50,964
What does this mean?

504
00:48:52,118 --> 00:48:54,099
We're the two Jigsaw targets.

505
00:49:08,233 --> 00:49:09,524
Fuck you.

506
00:49:15,438 --> 00:49:16,060
Hey.

507
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:19,008
Hey.

508
00:49:20,172 --> 00:49:21,224
Hey...

509
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:39,925
You jump off that block, you electrocute him.

510
00:49:40,247 --> 00:49:42,844
If that ice had melted more, he'd be fried.

511
00:49:43,037 --> 00:49:43,950
You understand?

512
00:49:43,951 --> 00:49:44,718
Listen to him.

513
00:49:54,514 --> 00:49:57,076
- You just made the biggest mistake of your life.
- Calm down.

514
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,434
- Cocksucker!
- I'll get somebody to take a look at it, alright?

515
00:49:59,627 --> 00:50:03,100
My client has a broken nose and a
fractured cheek bone.

516
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:06,538
Administrative leave with pay is not acceptable.

517
00:50:07,916 --> 00:50:10,321
The IA investigation's under way.

518
00:50:11,335 --> 00:50:14,163
Into this precinct, wow. What's
that gonna get me, huh?

519
00:50:14,164 --> 00:50:14,730
The truth.

520
00:50:14,731 --> 00:50:16,367
The truth. Well, I'll tell you
what the truth is.

521
00:50:16,368 --> 00:50:18,647
The truth is I have an eyewitness.

522
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:22,991
The man's wife? She stands to gain as much as he does
if there were to be a financial settlement.

523
00:50:22,992 --> 00:50:24,839
Which is not gonna happen because he's lying.

524
00:50:25,128 --> 00:50:26,835
He attacked Officer Rigg first.

525
00:50:26,836 --> 00:50:28,468
That's according to whom?

526
00:50:28,949 --> 00:50:31,324
Me. I saw the whole thing.

527
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,396
You want to testify before Grand Jury?

528
00:50:34,397 --> 00:50:35,942
I've already signed IA's affidavit.

529
00:50:35,943 --> 00:50:37,524
The charges are being dismissed.

530
00:50:37,621 --> 00:50:39,565
You guys are...you're good.

531
00:50:39,566 --> 00:50:40,402
You know you're...

532
00:50:40,403 --> 00:50:43,355
You're obviously as thick as thieves.

533
00:50:43,356 --> 00:50:44,368
It'll come back to you.

534
00:50:44,369 --> 00:50:44,633
You know that right?

535
00:50:44,754 --> 00:50:46,738
Maybe, one day.
Someday, it will.

536
00:50:46,739 --> 00:50:47,699
It will come back to you.

537
00:50:55,394 --> 00:50:56,376
You understand?

538
00:50:57,422 --> 00:50:58,906
Who the fuck are you?

539
00:50:58,907 --> 00:51:01,200
Hey, do you understand?

540
00:51:11,251 --> 00:51:12,278
Who the fuck are you?

541
00:52:45,532 --> 00:52:47,632
I did it! I won!

542
00:52:47,921 --> 00:52:49,078
What the hell did you do?

543
00:52:49,751 --> 00:52:50,642
I...

544
00:52:59,891 --> 00:53:01,968
What's happening?!

545
00:53:05,155 --> 00:53:07,924
The human body is a fascinating organism.

546
00:53:07,925 --> 00:53:13,183
It can withstand the most brutal injury and
yet repair itself miraculously.

547
00:53:13,821 --> 00:53:15,513
But you know this all too well.

548
00:53:15,706 --> 00:53:20,698
How many broken bones have you
suffered at the hands of your husband?

549
00:53:20,987 --> 00:53:23,029
How many flesh wounds have you endured?

550
00:53:23,729 --> 00:53:24,757
Help!!!

551
00:53:24,758 --> 00:53:28,536
With time, the bruises have healed
but your pain has not.

552
00:53:30,793 --> 00:53:34,729
Today, I empower you to take control of your life.

553
00:53:35,026 --> 00:53:39,961
Can you disconnect from the one thing that has
brought you and others so much pain?

554
00:53:40,503 --> 00:53:42,265
With time, your wounds will heal.

555
00:53:43,869 --> 00:53:45,647
His, however, will not.

556
00:53:50,593 --> 00:53:52,393
Remove the ties that bind.

557
00:53:52,586 --> 00:53:53,701
Get me out of here!!!

558
00:53:53,927 --> 00:53:56,712
Or bleed to death from your inactivity.

559
00:53:56,713 --> 00:53:58,195
The choice is yours.

560
00:53:58,196 --> 00:53:59,157
ok! Ok! Let me go!

561
00:54:06,611 --> 00:54:07,907
Sorry.

562
00:54:11,602 --> 00:54:12,204
Morgan...

563
00:54:12,205 --> 00:54:14,388
Morgan, what the fuck are you doing?!

564
00:54:45,516 --> 00:54:46,385
Help me.

565
00:54:46,386 --> 00:54:48,505
Please don't leave..

566
00:54:49,695 --> 00:54:50,548
- Please calm down.
- Don't leave me.

567
00:54:50,549 --> 00:54:51,844
No, don't go. Don't go!

568
00:54:51,878 --> 00:54:53,567
Don't go away from me.
Please get me out.

569
00:54:53,568 --> 00:54:54,742
Please get me out...

570
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,163
Don't go! Don't leave me here!

571
00:55:00,124 --> 00:55:01,265
Hello, Officer Rigg.

572
00:55:01,266 --> 00:55:03,077
What have you learnt thus far?

573
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:05,613
Experience is a harsh teacher.

574
00:55:05,614 --> 00:55:06,993
First comes the test.

575
00:55:07,698 --> 00:55:09,239
Second comes the lesson.

576
00:55:10,153 --> 00:55:16,674
If you are to save as I save, then you will see that
the person before you is but a student.

577
00:55:17,267 --> 00:55:18,843
So I ask you Officer Rigg.

578
00:55:19,397 --> 00:55:21,121
Has the pupil learnt her lesson?

579
00:55:21,657 --> 00:55:23,889
Has she been told the error of her ways?

580
00:55:25,285 --> 00:55:27,646
Does she now view the world differently?

581
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:34,806
Officer Rigg, the key to this person's
freedom lies in the palm of your hand.

582
00:55:35,191 --> 00:55:40,981
But only after she has done her own part,
can you play your role in her salvation?

583
00:55:40,982 --> 00:55:48,383
Once judgment has been made though, the key to
finding your next destination is just off the map.

584
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,555
Who did this to you?

585
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:51,711
I don't know.

586
00:55:53,854 --> 00:55:54,779
Oh fuck.

587
00:55:57,171 --> 00:55:58,545
Its just off the map.

588
00:55:59,629 --> 00:56:00,619
Just off the map.

589
00:56:02,228 --> 00:56:02,960
Tracy...

590
00:56:07,345 --> 00:56:08,314
Go home.

591
00:56:11,487 --> 00:56:12,265
Where is she?

592
00:56:12,496 --> 00:56:13,567
I'm so cold...

593
00:56:14,444 --> 00:56:14,760
Please...

594
00:56:21,738 --> 00:56:23,599
I wanna live..

595
00:56:28,394 --> 00:56:29,812
You gotta save yourself.

596
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,363
Don't leave me...help me please...

597
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,443
..stop playing..

598
00:56:47,917 --> 00:56:50,046
Why don't you fucking kill me...?

599
00:56:50,047 --> 00:56:50,783
No.

600
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,027
Shut up!

601
00:56:55,028 --> 00:56:56,884
I don't wanna play anymore..

602
00:56:59,926 --> 00:57:01,386
Save as I save.

603
00:57:01,962 --> 00:57:03,995
So what did he do?
Free her and let him die?

604
00:57:03,996 --> 00:57:04,889
This guy didn't have a chance.

605
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:07,294
He's got rods going through every
major arteries in his body.

606
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,661
You life is in her hands.

607
00:57:08,662 --> 00:57:10,548
Rigg didn't kill this guy.
His wife did.

608
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:13,350
She identified Officer Rigg.
Said he saved her.

609
00:57:13,351 --> 00:57:14,634
Saved her?

610
00:57:15,115 --> 00:57:16,309
Passed Rigg's judgments.

611
00:57:16,310 --> 00:57:17,768
He got her fixed and
got her freedom back.

612
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:22,154
Yeah?

613
00:57:22,527 --> 00:57:23,066
Second address?

614
00:57:27,543 --> 00:57:29,012
Ok yeah. That's good.
Good.

615
00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:30,781
But I still need that address.
Text me.

616
00:57:31,361 --> 00:57:34,248
I just found out something very interesting
about the three people in the traps.

617
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:37,706
They were all represented by a
lawyer named Art Blanc.

618
00:57:37,803 --> 00:57:38,856
He got them all off?

619
00:57:38,857 --> 00:57:40,086
Yeah, but wait it gets better.

620
00:57:40,087 --> 00:57:41,530
He's also Jill Tuck's lawyer.

621
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:43,586
Look out!

622
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:50,115
There's a lair.
Where's the lair?

623
00:57:50,116 --> 00:57:51,171
It doesn't exist.

624
00:57:51,364 --> 00:57:52,861
Jigsaw wanted us to find that place.

625
00:57:53,054 --> 00:57:54,037
Where's the new game being played?

626
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:55,657
Find that place, we find Rigg.

627
00:57:55,658 --> 00:57:57,693
We got a second address.
There's a co-owner.

628
00:57:57,694 --> 00:57:58,215
Who?

629
00:57:58,216 --> 00:57:58,846
Jill Tuck.

630
00:57:58,847 --> 00:58:00,470
Jill Tuck? Where's the building?

631
00:58:00,471 --> 00:58:01,591
Here. This building.

632
00:59:08,445 --> 00:59:09,753
Hello, Agent Perez.

633
00:59:10,434 --> 00:59:13,674
And welcome to the world that
you have long studied.

634
00:59:14,038 --> 00:59:19,045
Your partner, Agent Strahm, will soon
take the life of an innocent man.

635
00:59:19,281 --> 00:59:21,036
Heed my warning, Agent Perez.

636
00:59:21,229 --> 00:59:24,229
Your next move is critical.

637
00:59:29,492 --> 00:59:30,394
What is that?

638
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:49,119
Paramedics!

639
00:59:49,984 --> 00:59:50,843
Help!

640
00:59:51,986 --> 00:59:53,033
Lindsey, stay with us.

641
00:59:53,932 --> 00:59:54,796
Okay. Come on.

642
00:59:54,989 --> 00:59:55,974
Come on.

643
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,249
Stay with me, alright.

644
01:00:23,375 --> 01:00:24,159
Hey.

645
01:00:26,352 --> 01:00:27,793
Hey you. Come here.

646
01:00:30,652 --> 01:00:32,383
Hey.

647
01:00:32,384 --> 01:00:33,514
Come on!

648
01:00:34,113 --> 01:00:37,046
Hey.

649
01:00:52,168 --> 01:00:53,133
Fuck!

650
01:00:53,326 --> 01:00:54,006
Hey!

651
01:00:54,967 --> 01:00:58,245
Listen to me. I'm not the one you
gotta worry about, you understand me.

652
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:00,111
I'm not the one you gotta worry about.

653
01:01:02,428 --> 01:01:06,390
As a matter of fact, I'd recommend you
stay alive until the fucking...

654
01:01:06,999 --> 01:01:08,689
...clock counts down.

655
01:01:10,653 --> 01:01:11,542
Here's the good news.

656
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:15,849
If this other guy passes his tests,
the three of us can go free.

657
01:01:17,401 --> 01:01:19,131
Hey, look at me.

658
01:01:19,324 --> 01:01:20,279
Look at me.

659
01:01:20,856 --> 01:01:23,778
If you don't stay on the block,
your partner gets electrocuted.

660
01:01:24,163 --> 01:01:25,825
Now for my final task.

661
01:01:28,635 --> 01:01:29,521
Here you go.

662
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:31,973
Live or die.

663
01:01:33,186 --> 01:01:34,349
You make the choice.

664
01:01:42,022 --> 01:01:43,076
You see that, Jill.

665
01:01:43,077 --> 01:01:44,714
That's a federal fucking indictment.

666
01:01:44,715 --> 01:01:46,664
It's got your name on it. You wanna
put somebody else's name on it?

667
01:01:46,665 --> 01:01:47,948
You start talking to me, okay?

668
01:01:47,949 --> 01:01:50,446
What's with the doll?
What's with the tricycle?

669
01:01:50,447 --> 01:01:52,289
Who were John's business associates
before he went insane?

670
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:53,442
He wasn't the associate type.

671
01:01:55,608 --> 01:01:56,786
Where the hell is our Art Blanc?

672
01:01:57,475 --> 01:02:00,986
Obstruction of justice. Aiding and abetting.
Conspirator to murder.

673
01:02:01,792 --> 01:02:02,472
Talk to me!

674
01:02:02,473 --> 01:02:05,309
In 15 minutes, more people are gonna die, Jill.

675
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:06,354
Police officers.

676
01:02:06,388 --> 01:02:07,770
He's your business partner. He's your friend.

677
01:02:07,771 --> 01:02:11,783
He's the accomplice we have been looking
for and he is your fucking lawyer.

678
01:02:14,106 --> 01:02:14,662
You see this?

679
01:02:14,663 --> 01:02:16,466
This is my partner's blood.

680
01:02:16,467 --> 01:02:20,942
She's fighting for her life right now
because of your lunatic husband.

681
01:02:21,862 --> 01:02:24,502
What happened between Jigsaw and Art Blanc?

682
01:02:24,503 --> 01:02:25,464
John?

683
01:02:32,133 --> 01:02:33,567
I guess he's not here either.

684
01:02:34,275 --> 01:02:36,228
What the fuck is this place, Jill?

685
01:02:42,713 --> 01:02:43,922
Don't get mad.

686
01:02:43,923 --> 01:02:44,884
What?

687
01:02:48,374 --> 01:02:50,836
Hey, you alright?

688
01:02:51,316 --> 01:02:54,387
You're not returning my calls, buddy.

689
01:02:55,367 --> 01:02:56,224
Listen, John.

690
01:02:58,204 --> 01:02:58,958
I'm sorry.

691
01:02:58,959 --> 01:03:02,290
I understand what happened was a tragedy

692
01:03:02,963 --> 01:03:04,253
But I gotta tell you.

693
01:03:05,468 --> 01:03:06,922
Listen, John. I gotta tell you.

694
01:03:06,923 --> 01:03:08,458
You know those buildings we're working on.

695
01:03:08,491 --> 01:03:10,107
You take and give my share to Jill.

696
01:03:10,108 --> 01:03:11,515
That's not the way it works, John.

697
01:03:11,549 --> 01:03:12,426
See we're partners.

698
01:03:12,427 --> 01:03:15,592
Your designs are what make those buildings special.

699
01:03:15,593 --> 01:03:17,258
We got 40 families ready to move in.

700
01:03:17,259 --> 01:03:18,499
40 families, John.

701
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,704
Low-income families.

702
01:03:19,705 --> 01:03:21,307
You can't just walk away.

703
01:03:21,596 --> 01:03:23,490
You're their saviour, John.

704
01:03:23,683 --> 01:03:24,904
Get the fuck out of here.

705
01:03:24,905 --> 01:03:27,029
Who are you talking to like that? That's me.

706
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:27,653
John.

707
01:03:27,654 --> 01:03:29,130
Dis you hear what I said?

708
01:03:29,131 --> 01:03:30,441
Oh, I heard you John.

709
01:03:34,035 --> 01:03:35,234
Get the fuck...

710
01:03:38,286 --> 01:03:39,205
You heard me.

711
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:42,853
Ok, John.

712
01:03:43,141 --> 01:03:45,516
You take good care of yourself.

713
01:03:47,341 --> 01:03:48,375
Give me a call when you're feeling better.

714
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:08,841
He blamed me.

715
01:04:09,933 --> 01:04:11,523
I don't think he could ever forgive me.

716
01:04:12,004 --> 01:04:13,960
In his mind, our time was over.

717
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:17,753
He was diagnosed with cancer soon after that.

718
01:04:28,021 --> 01:04:29,610
Did you try to contact him again?

719
01:04:30,407 --> 01:04:31,137
I tried.

720
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,239
But a different person crawled
out of the wreckage.

721
01:04:36,203 --> 01:04:37,445
Someone else survived.

722
01:05:07,844 --> 01:05:09,284
I asked you not to come here.

723
01:05:09,285 --> 01:05:09,888
I just wanna talk to you.

724
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:10,576
John. John.

725
01:05:11,894 --> 01:05:12,510
Look at this.

726
01:05:12,511 --> 01:05:13,447
What is this?

727
01:05:14,791 --> 01:05:15,997
Why do you have this old picture?

728
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:17,854
What have you done to him?

729
01:05:18,777 --> 01:05:21,881
I told him not to take life for granted.

730
01:05:22,826 --> 01:05:24,091
I want to play a game.

731
01:05:24,867 --> 01:05:26,004
Your life is a lie.

732
01:05:27,677 --> 01:05:29,483
Now, comes your moment of truth.

733
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:33,779
As a drug user and a hustler, you've played
roulette with other people's lives.

734
01:05:35,256 --> 01:05:37,555
Today, you play with your own.

735
01:06:38,521 --> 01:06:38,978
Fuck.

736
01:06:45,633 --> 01:06:46,128
Fuck!

737
01:06:51,278 --> 01:06:51,844
Fuck.

738
01:06:52,924 --> 01:06:53,594
It's you.

739
01:06:53,787 --> 01:06:55,176
You did this to me.

740
01:06:55,199 --> 01:06:55,741
No.

741
01:06:56,889 --> 01:06:58,079
You did this to yourself.

742
01:06:59,579 --> 01:07:01,955
Your greed took the life of
an innocent child.

743
01:07:01,956 --> 01:07:04,597
Would you give me time to explain, please?

744
01:07:05,032 --> 01:07:07,434
I can't give you time.
No one can.

745
01:07:07,435 --> 01:07:08,447
Time is an illusion.

746
01:07:08,448 --> 01:07:12,128
Look. Look.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

747
01:07:12,129 --> 01:07:13,991
I forgive you, Cecil.
I do.

748
01:07:13,992 --> 01:07:15,968
Addiction has ruined your life.

749
01:07:15,969 --> 01:07:17,104
I'm bleeding man.

750
01:07:17,105 --> 01:07:19,286
Please, just let me go.

751
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:21,117
I could let you go.

752
01:07:22,135 --> 01:07:23,720
But that wouldn't serve you.

753
01:07:24,986 --> 01:07:26,351
I'll tell you what I will do, though.

754
01:07:26,352 --> 01:07:30,904
I'll give you a tool to reclaim your life.

755
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:34,681
And to discard the vices that
have so corrupted your soul.

756
01:07:34,682 --> 01:07:36,869
I don't have a fucking soul.

757
01:07:37,062 --> 01:07:38,781
Maybe, you will in the next life, Cecil.

758
01:07:38,782 --> 01:07:40,536
You see things aren't sequential.

759
01:07:41,327 --> 01:07:43,479
Good doesn't lead to good nor bad to bad.

760
01:07:43,745 --> 01:07:47,301
People steal, don't get caught.
Live the good life.

761
01:07:47,878 --> 01:07:50,619
Others lie and cheat. And get elected.

762
01:07:50,908 --> 01:07:53,782
Some people stop to help a stranded motorist..

763
01:07:53,783 --> 01:07:57,207
..and get taken out by a speeding semi.

764
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,942
There's no accounting for it.

765
01:07:59,919 --> 01:08:01,406
How you play the cards you're dealt.

766
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,532
That's all that matters.

767
01:08:02,533 --> 01:08:03,773
Look at me.

768
01:08:05,589 --> 01:08:07,228
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

769
01:08:07,229 --> 01:08:08,423
No.

770
01:08:08,904 --> 01:08:11,984
Yeah, I understand.

771
01:08:13,302 --> 01:08:14,710
You're fucking nuts.

772
01:08:28,378 --> 01:08:30,903
Woah! What the fuck is that?

773
01:08:32,077 --> 01:08:35,678
It's the tool that's gonna save your life.

774
01:08:37,119 --> 01:08:38,337
I wanna play a game.

775
01:08:39,981 --> 01:08:41,795
Your life is a lie, Cecil.

776
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:44,734
Now comes your moment of truth.

777
01:08:45,796 --> 01:08:52,314
As a drug addict and a thief, you prey on the
kindness of others to fuel your addiction.

778
01:08:52,735 --> 01:08:57,247
Today, we're bringing the uglyness inside
you out into the open.

779
01:08:57,248 --> 01:09:03,897
Now, in order for you to stay alive, you've to match
your face with the uglyness of your soul.

780
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:09,732
You just lean forward into the
knives with your face.

781
01:09:10,295 --> 01:09:16,285
Press hard enough and you'll release the arm
and the leg restraints that bind you.

782
01:09:17,812 --> 01:09:18,648
Press hard though.

783
01:09:20,966 --> 01:09:22,194
And you'll be free.

784
01:09:22,195 --> 01:09:24,314
You... you sick fuck!

785
01:09:24,653 --> 01:09:25,362
Fuck you!

786
01:09:25,555 --> 01:09:29,932
Or you can sit idly and
bleed out on the floor.

787
01:09:31,351 --> 01:09:32,612
Live or die, Cecil.

788
01:09:33,781 --> 01:09:35,044
Make your choice.

789
01:09:44,927 --> 01:09:45,617
Fuck you!

790
01:09:47,637 --> 01:09:48,459
Help!

791
01:10:34,061 --> 01:10:38,164
You're dead. You're fucking dead.

792
01:10:39,685 --> 01:10:41,635
Fucking dead!

793
01:10:55,490 --> 01:10:56,446
What's happened to you?

794
01:10:59,683 --> 01:11:00,988
What's happened to me?

795
01:11:12,138 --> 01:11:13,323
Now, you don't come back.

796
01:11:14,882 --> 01:11:17,345
You do it for yourself if you can't do it for me.

797
01:11:18,563 --> 01:11:19,800
I lost him too.

798
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:56,581
Four walls build a home.

799
01:12:05,328 --> 01:12:07,694
Your son was named after
John's first building, right?

800
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:08,991
Yes.

801
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:09,596
Where is it?

802
01:12:12,142 --> 01:12:13,457
Where is it?

803
01:12:33,932 --> 01:12:35,167
What the fuck does that mean?

804
01:13:34,561 --> 01:13:36,265
Better hope he doesn't come
through that door.

805
01:13:37,062 --> 01:13:39,430
Who?! Who's coming through the door?!

806
01:13:43,677 --> 01:13:44,201
Who is it?!

807
01:15:14,951 --> 01:15:16,395
Who's coming through the door?!

808
01:15:28,295 --> 01:15:28,635
Fuck.

809
01:15:48,933 --> 01:15:50,520
Congratulations, Art.

810
01:16:23,552 --> 01:16:23,970
Who is it?!

811
01:16:28,063 --> 01:16:29,558
Who's coming through the door?!

812
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:32,051
Here he comes.

813
01:16:33,344 --> 01:16:34,586
Who the fuck is it?!

814
01:16:34,587 --> 01:16:35,546
Rigg.

815
01:16:41,426 --> 01:16:42,018
Oh shit.

816
01:16:45,116 --> 01:16:46,257
Teach me, motherfucker.

817
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:50,840
I'm standing right here.

818
01:17:06,912 --> 01:17:07,633
Lynn...

819
01:17:32,552 --> 01:17:33,385
What is that?!

820
01:17:34,681 --> 01:17:36,988
This will release us when the timer's up.

821
01:17:41,521 --> 01:17:42,759
Release me!

822
01:17:45,194 --> 01:17:45,604
Fuck.

823
01:18:06,385 --> 01:18:07,038
Don't open the door!

824
01:18:50,977 --> 01:18:52,628
Let me see your fucking hands!

825
01:18:52,662 --> 01:18:54,571
Release my daughter!
You mother...

826
01:18:56,756 --> 01:18:57,524
Fuck.

827
01:19:05,396 --> 01:19:06,135
Jesus...

828
01:19:19,313 --> 01:19:21,758
Aw, you stupid motherfucker.
What did you do?

829
01:19:22,046 --> 01:19:23,339
I had more time.

830
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:25,278
I said I had fucking time...

831
01:19:25,279 --> 01:19:26,347
Why did you open that door?

832
01:19:26,348 --> 01:19:28,190
- You fucking did this!
- No, you idiot.

833
01:19:28,191 --> 01:19:30,348
- You fucking did this!
- No, Jigsaw's testing you.

834
01:19:30,349 --> 01:19:31,552
You fucking piece of shit!

835
01:19:32,111 --> 01:19:33,733
Put your fucking hands where I can see it.

836
01:19:33,734 --> 01:19:35,064
Put your fucking hands where I can see it.

837
01:19:35,065 --> 01:19:37,010
- Jigsaw's fucking testing you!
- Don't fucking move!

838
01:19:40,893 --> 01:19:41,933
Hello, Officer Rigg.

839
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:49,786
If you hearing this, then you have reached
Detective Matthews and Detective Hoffman in under 90 minutes.

840
01:19:50,831 --> 01:19:52,015
Resulting in their deaths.

841
01:19:52,768 --> 01:19:54,142
The rules were clear.

842
01:19:54,527 --> 01:19:56,313
You were warned.

843
01:19:56,314 --> 01:19:57,052
<i>It's Kerry.</i>

844
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:58,445
<i>Do not go throught that door.</i>

845
01:19:58,734 --> 01:20:00,987
<i>You know never to go through an unsecured door, ever.</i>

846
01:20:01,956 --> 01:20:04,082
<i>Tonight, you face your obsession.</i>

847
01:20:04,179 --> 01:20:07,366
<i>What you can't do is save everyone.</i>

848
01:20:07,367 --> 01:20:08,975
<i>Will you learn how to let go?</i>

849
01:20:09,862 --> 01:20:11,503
<i>Eric is still out there man.</i>

850
01:20:11,504 --> 01:20:12,454
<i>It's time to let go.</i>

851
01:20:12,455 --> 01:20:15,044
<i>Detective Matthews has but ninety minutes.</i>

852
01:20:15,045 --> 01:20:19,411
<i>I'd recommend you stay alive until the
fucking clock counts down.</i>

853
01:20:19,412 --> 01:20:21,288
<i>They have to save themselves.</i>

854
01:20:22,117 --> 01:20:22,647
<i>Take em.</i>

855
01:20:26,236 --> 01:20:28,980
<i>Their salvation was out of your hand</i>

856
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:34,197
<i>Time was on your side but your obsession
wouldn't let you wait.</i>

857
01:20:34,555 --> 01:20:38,556
<i>Instead of saving Detective Matthews,
you cost him his life.</i>

858
01:20:38,845 --> 01:20:40,756
<i>You failed your final test.</i>

859
01:21:04,297 --> 01:21:07,395
<i>What I don't understand is how the hell could
Jigsaw do all of these.</i>

860
01:21:07,395 --> 01:21:09,525
<i>He was damn near on his death bed
the last time we saw him.</i>

861
01:21:09,526 --> 01:21:10,772
<i>I'm not so sure he did it.</i>

862
01:21:17,344 --> 01:21:18,989
<i>This wasn't done by Amanda Young.</i>

863
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:19,559
<i>Excuse me?</i>

864
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:20,829
<i>She couldn't get her up there alone.</i>

865
01:21:20,884 --> 01:21:21,660
<i>John Kramer was.</i>

866
01:21:21,693 --> 01:21:22,710
<i>He's brains. Not brawn.</i>

867
01:21:23,183 --> 01:21:25,763
<i>We're here to find the person helping
Jigsaw and Amanda Young.</i>

868
01:21:36,279 --> 01:21:38,277
<i>Looks like another doctor went missing from the hospital.</i>

869
01:21:42,252 --> 01:21:42,756
<i>Go home.</i>

870
01:21:46,746 --> 01:21:47,674
<i>We chose this.</i>

871
01:22:04,109 --> 01:22:04,926
Game over.

872
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:35,473
You feel you now have control, don't you?

873
01:22:37,712 --> 01:22:39,802
You think you will walk away untested?

874
01:22:47,017 --> 01:22:49,717
I promise that my work will continue.

875
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:52,198
That I have insured.

876
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:57,432
By hearing this tape, some will assume
that this is over.

877
01:22:57,433 --> 01:22:59,155
But I am still among you.

878
01:23:00,657 --> 01:23:03,690
You think it's over just because I'm dead?

879
01:23:04,171 --> 01:23:07,426
It's not over. The games have just begun.
