Dear Francine,
please, ask yourself,
what would you have done?
I did make a promise
to the man I loved.
We're here.
You're home, ma'am.
Hmm?
Have you ever
tried to imagine that moment?
The day you come home alone.
What was so full is suddenly so empty.
Joe would have hated that silence.
He would have wanted a party.
So I tried.
This was on our
very first field trip to Borneo.
We had just started
doing our research.
He really relied on you.
Oh! Excuse me!
I was afraid you weren't coming.
Oh! Oh!
What happened to the box?
Well, the diet gave me the box
to bring Joe’s ashes home from Borneo
but he so loved that urn...
- It held the hearts of sa...
- Sacrificed warriors.
We'll want to put him
in something more substantial.
Arvilla, damn it.
Let me do those.
- Oh.
- Go visit with your company.
I can't take any more sympathy.
When Ralph died,
I washed dishes nonstop for weeks.
Eased the pain,
but ruined my hands.
I don't know what
I would have done without you.
Well, it was a choice
between Joe’s funeral
and that stupid cruise
I saved 10 years for
and I just figured that
the funeral would be more fun.
I know I owe you an answer, Francine,
but you had no right
to try to take him.
You're his daughter, yes,
but whatever you
might think of me,
I was his wife.
I don't suppose Daddy got to finish this.
No, but I have all his notes
I thought I might try.
Mother typed his first two books.
I know.
She was always too ill to travel,
you know?
I've, um, made a list
of family heirlooms,
things that belong back home.
Um, and if you don't mind.
Daddy's ashes would be
much easier to carry onto the plane
in, um, that box.
But, Fran... Francine,
I promised Joe...
You're not gonna scatter his ashes.
He shouldn't even be ashes.
No, but that's what he wanted.
He made me promise.
We are laying him to rest in Montecito
a week from Saturday
next to Mother.
That's what he wanted.
- No, but, Francine...
- It's in the will.
We also need to discuss this house.
What? This house?
Daddy left it to me.
But this is our home.
We lived here for 20 years.
- All... Everything we...
- Arvilla.
You must have seen the will.
Yes, but he made another will
after we were married.
- Did you ever see it?
- Well...
Daddy didn't always
get around to things, did he?
Like retire back to Santa Barbara
to be near his grandchildren.
Daddy gave you a wonderful life.
Let me take him home,
and you can have this house.
No.
No. I-I'm sorry, Francine
I can't. Not tonight.
The service is a week from Saturday.
I will call you
to make the arrangements.
Before I met Joe,
I'd barely been out of Idaho.
He certainly changed that.
What would I do without him?
- Mrs Holden?
- Yes?
I'm Riva Fox. Your daughter called
and asked me to handle your sale.
I am so sorry for your loss.
You have such a lovely home.
May I come in?
No. No, you may not.
I don't have a daughter.
- But Mrs Packard...
- Is not my daughter.
And my house is not for sale.
- Boy, they sure don't waste any time, do they?
- Oh.
Oh.
- What happened?
- It's Francine.
She's threatening to sell the house
unless I give her Joe’s ashes.
- What?
- She can't sell your house.
Well, it's her house,
according to the will that she has.
I don't know. Um, Joe...
I was sure Joe made another will
when we got married
but I can't find it anywhere.
- Did you talk to your lawyer?
- Archibald Pratt.
Oh, he's in a nursing home.
Last time I saw him,
he called me Nana.
Well, but his files have to have...
No, his files were in the basement
last spring during the flood.
- It's gotta be here somewhere.
- No, it's not.
It's not.
Believe me,
I've searched everywhere.
Maybe God wants Joe
back with his family.
- God, I can't believe you said that Carol!
- I'm sorry I'm sorry, Arvilla.
I didn't mean it like that.
Our marriage was everything to us.
We were inseparable.
You know that.
Francine can't take that
away from you.
No, she can't take that
away from me.
But she can't take away
your house either.
Yes, but I promised Joe
that I would scatter his ashes.
He doesn't want to
be sealed up in a box.
He wants to be out in the world.
Arvilla, Joe wouldn't want you
to lose this house.
Well.
I'm not packing Joe up
and dropping him off at the post office.
Hello.
Oh, hello, Arvilla.
Good. Thank you I'll arrange to...
What?
Oh, no.
Really, you needn't come.
Oh no, of course you're invited.
The service is a week from
Saturday at 1:00 pm.
You can stay in the green bedroom.
No, it's no trouble, I insist.
Yes just let me know your plans.
Yes. Fine.
Good-bye, Arvilla.
- That was Arvilla.
- Mm-hmm.
She's bringing Daddy's ashes.
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.
- You're doing the right thing.
- Yeah?
Especially going in person.
- And we'll come with you.
- We'll what?
Oh, no. You don't have to do that.
Well, listen, sister.
I was supposed to be on
the cruise of a lifetime this week.
- You owe me a trip.
- Really?
Oh!
Well, fine then.
Let's take a trip.
Well, we can fly out
of Salt Lake on Monday.
But the funeral
isn't until Saturday.
Well, that gives us time
for Beverly Hills and the beach and...
Ooh!
I'll make the arrangements.
It's my treat.
Rodeo Drive, here I come!
- All right!
- Oh!
Neither one of us should be
going on this trip.
- Oh, come on.
- I can't leave Arlo alone for a whole week.
Well, how would you know?
You haven't left his side since high school.
- I have so.
- Trips to the ladies' room don't count.
And when did you last have to
take care of a man, Miss Free-As-A-Bird?
Well, why do you think
I booked that stupid cruise?
I was hopin' to take care of a man
one more time before I die.
Oh, Margene.
I'm sorry, Joe.
- Hey!
- Looking good there, Sister Brimm.
You too! Oh!
Oh! Whoo! Arvilla!
- You look like a new woman.
- Oh!
Mom, wait.
Oh, I packed a snack.
For who, the Green Bay Packers?
Salt Lake's only three hours.
I thought you said
we were taking the Volvo.
- Why don't you let me drive you to Salt Lake?
- Oh, no, Arlo, thanks.
Women only from here on.
Well, then take our car.
This thing doesn't even have air bags.
Sure it does. Three of them.
Come on. Come on.
Go on. Have fun.
Heck, go a little crazy.
- Shotgun!
- Bye.
- Okay. You take care of him, all right?
- Arvilla.
- There.
- Don't let anything happen to Joe
or Arvilla will be living
out of a shopping cart.
- Evelyn, your father's pills are in the...
- I know where they are, Mom.
If you let her finish,
you're gonna miss your plane.
We're six hours early
I think we'll be all right.
Don't forget your sunblock, Mom.
Bye! Have fun!
- Be careful, ladies.
- Bye! I'll miss you!
Joe's Bonneville...
I'd never even driven that darn thing.
To be honest,
I think I was going a little crazy.
Laughing one minute,
crying the next.
- I was a mess.
- Oh! Ah!
- Arvilla!
- Arvilla!
Whoa!
- Ooh.
- What?
Arvilla, what are you doing?
Are you okay?
Here I got these for the beach,
but, well...
- What?
- You can use them now.
Oh!
Oh! Oh!
- Oh!
- Oh, I love it!
That was so thoughtful.
This is my color too.
- Uh-huh.
- This will help with the hair
- Hello, Jackie O.
- Ooh.
Let me get my glasses on.
- You look like Grace Kelly.
- Oh, do I?
Fabulous. Okay. All right.
- Here. Ready?
- Yes. Let me take Joe back.
- Okay.
- All right, girls.
Here we go.
All right.
California, here we come.
Hey!
Yeah!
- I wonder what the "L" stands for?
- Luscious.
Oh, it's loser.
- Wish this relic had a tape player.
Why?
Did you pack your eight-tracks?
- I gave those to Goodwill.
- Did not.
I know you didn't.
Margene!
- That's coffee! Oh!
- What did you expect, chicken soup?
- What kind of Mormon are you?
- The fun kind.
Come on. You're not gonna
go to hell over a cup of coffee.
- Besides, if anybody's gonna fry, it's gonna be me.
- Don't say that.
I drink coffee,
enjoy the occasional
medicinal scotch.
And I would give anything
to feel a man's...
Oh, Margene.
Big rig.
Who put a nickel in you?
You don't remember this?
He locked us in the basement
so we couldn't get away.
And then Rusty Marcen jimmied the window,
and we all climbed out and escaped.
- Except for Tommy Scoefield, the little wuss.
- I don't remember.
- Oh, look!
- Oh-ho!
Hi!
Oh, my word! They're so young.
Really takes you back, doesn't it?
Have you ever been to the Salt Flats?
No.
Arvilla, we don't have time
to go sightseeing.
- We'll get a later flight It's okay.
- But Francine's expecting us.
- Who are you calling?
- I'm just calling Arlo.
Arlo said to have fun,
so have fun, damn it.
It's not the same.
- The same as what?
- Well, Joe and I stopped here on our honeymoon.
It was perfectly dry then.
There were amateur races that day
and a driver let Joe
take his sports car for a run.
I stood there and watched
as the man I just married
raced away at 150 miles an hour.
- Tighten your seat belts.
- Why?
'Cause I promised Arlo
I would get you back in one piece.
This is stupid!
Oh! Oh!
- No!
- Oh, no!
- Yeah!
- This isn't funny! Oh, my goodness!
Joe! Joe! Joe! Stop the car!
Stop the car, damn it!
Oh!
- Oh. Of course.
- Oh.
Oh!
I told you I didn't think
we should come.
I suppose you think this is funny.
- We're stranded.
- Don't worry. Everything's fine.
No, it isn't.
Carol Brimm said "damn it".
I did not.
And don't you dare tell anyone.
Someone will come by.
We could die here.
Then we'll all go together.
Found it?
Joe gave me this scarf.
- Where'd you get that?
- It was under the front seat.
Oh.
Oh.
Aww.
Bryce Canyon on our honeymoon.
There's someone out there.
- What?
- Carol's hallucinating.
Look! No. Look, look!
Someone's out there.
Oh.
What should we do?
Ooh Margene!
- Need help?
- No, honey. We're just sunbathin'.
Do you need help?
I'm Bo.
I'm Arvilla.
Where did you come from?
I'm hitchhiking.
I never been to the Salt Flats.
It's breathtaking, ain't it?
Here! Let me!
Oh, thank you.
Oh! Hallelujah!
Do you think it's safe?
- Well...
- Oh!
What are you waitin' for,
an engraved invitation?
Which direction are you heading?
Does it matter?
We're heading south.
So am I.
Well, get in.
Arvilla, wait.
You don't mean that we're...
No, we're not driving all the way
to California in this thing.
Joe had "this thing" overhauled
just last month. She's as good as new.
- I wish we could all do that.
- No, I'm serious.
- So am I.
- What about Francine?
Well, I'll call her.
Uh...
It works.
It's her machine.
Francine?
This is Arvilla. Um... Um...
I don't... We missed the flight
and, um...
so we've decided to drive.
Okay.
You're my witnesses I called.
How they grow.
They neither toil nor spin.
I was toiling and spinning in the car
on the way over to the station today.
Don't worry.
He's not going anywhere.
I just wish you hadn't given him the keys.
That's all.
Okay. Three Trucker Specials.
Thank you.
And a veggie sand.
I don't think he can hear.
I'll go get him.
It... It's a beautiful car.
It was my husband's.
Oh, uh, I thought you might
need a clean T-shirt.
So, you're not from around here.
- Nah
- Well, neither are we.
We're from Pocatello, Idaho.
Where are you headed, Bo?
New Mexico.
- What's in New Mexico?
- Hmm?
What's in New Mexico?
Family reunion.
And you? Vacation?
Oh, yeah. It's a regular joyride.
We're taking Arvilla's husband
back to her stepdaughter.
Oh.
Oh I'm sorry.
- See, Arvilla promised to scatter his ashes...
- Margene!
- He's not interested in this.
- But... But if she... if she does
Joe's daughter
will take away her house.
Oh.
Bo, be careful down there.
Are you sure you know what you're doing
with all those wires?
Whew! There!
That should do it.
Hmm.
Where do your parents live?
My father lives in New Mexico.
- And your mother?
- She died when I was nine.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, she's beautiful, Bo.
- So beautiful.
- May I?
- Oh.
- So your father raised you?
- I raised myself.
- But someone must have been there to take care of you.
They met when he was on leave
and she never heard from him again.
- But...
- But you found him.
I promised my mom I would.
Oh.
Where are we?
I don't know.
I don't know, but I think
we've gone far enough for today.
I'm gonna find a motel.
We're gonna continue
on south tomorrow, Bo,
if you want to keep riding with us.
Ladies!
Thank you, but it's taken me
so long to get here
and I'm in kind of a hurry.
Well, you ever get up to Pocatello,
you look us up.
I mean it.
Come give an old lady a kiss.
Oh, Bo, here. Don't forget this.
You know what? Keep it.
- Oh, Bo Don't be silly.
- Please, it's a gift.
I could use the silence
and you guys could use the tunes.
Well, then let me buy it.
You gave me a ride, and that's fair.
You rescued us off the Salt Flats.
We must be worth more than that.
Please? Bo.
Bo, take my Book of Mormon.
You might find something good in it.
I got this one
from my first ride in Utah.
And I've been offered two more.
Keep yours.
It looks like it's special.
Now, you be careful. There are
some dangerous people on the road.
Ah! Like you three.
Uh...
Here. Headphones.
I hope you find your father, Bo.
At least I tried.
And that was it...
the moment I started to wonder.
Was I wrong?
If a nine-year-old boy
could make a promise
and keep it all these years,
shouldn't I?
Oh, Arvilla.
Have you got any quarters?
Carol cut me off.
Bless your little heart.
- Ah Have you ever been to Bryce Canyon?
- No Why?
It's so beautiful.
Oh.
Joe and I drove the Bonneville
on the back roads
all the way from Santa Barbara
to Pocatello.
We always said we were gonna
go back for a second honeymoon,
but...
You planned this all along, didn't you?
You never intended to fly.
Yeah. See for yourself.
Come on. You have to try it!
Oh.
- Klepto.
- They're for Arlo.
- He collects them.
- Yeah, sure he does.
Come on. Get over here.
- No, I'm busy.
- Carol's had enough adventure for one day.
You two don't think I'm any fun,
do you?
No, we think you don't think
you're any fun.
Now you've done it!
- Oh, thank you so much.
- Good as new.
All right. Now, let's figure out...
- You got coffee!
- I bought it for you.
- Ooh. Look who's here.
Thanks.
Mornin'. Uh, you probably
don't remember me.
I'm Emmett Johnson.
That's my truck, and yest...
We do remember you.
Your truck made quite an impression.
Well, so do three beautiful women
in a convertible.
Uh...
Look, I'm gonna go in there and eat.
- I'd be honored if you'd join me for breakfast.
- Oh, no, we just ate
Well, how 'bout coffee?
Yeah.
Well, look, now, we seem to be heading in
the same direction down this road here
and maybe we could have dinner
down the road?
- Do you think?
- Oh, no... We've made other plans.
Well, all right.
I'll let you go then.
Safe trip.
We are, um, going to be
in Las Vegas on Thursday.
Are ya?
- Anyplace special?
- Yes.
Um, we're going to be
at the Riviera at 8:00.
Riviera at 8:00.
I'll see what I can do.
Um, I'm Arvilla.
And this... this is Margene.
And, uh, that is Carol.
Carol. Oh, hello.
Nice to meet ya.
Safe travels.
I can't believe you told him
where we were going!
What if he shows up?
This from the woman
who wanted to go on the Love Boat?
Oh, please.
- You thought he was hot yesterday.
- That was yesterday.
Today he's just a stranger in a truck.
- Oh. Let's get out of here.
- Wait. What are you doing?
- I'm gonna drive.
- Oh, come on!
- Come on. Joe would let me.
- No.
Ah, suit yourself.
But look,
you gotta be careful
'cause this is really powerful.
The only other time Joe ever got my goat
was that stupid shrunken head.
"Look what I brought you
from New Guinea," he says.
He thought it was perfect for you.
Well, they probably could have
heard my scream in New Guinea.
We were just fooling around.
When Joe asked me to spread his ashes
he didn't say where.
But now part of him
was out there on the Salt Flats.
It was an accident,
but he'd be happy to be there.
- Well, at least we didn't have
chemistry or hot lunch
until my senior year.
Aww.
Francine. Her special ring.
Aw, that's mean.
Joe... Joe picked it out.
She's not answering.
I think her message said "we".
You don't suppose she's bringing
that awful Margene?
Well, that would liven things up.
Just what Daddy's funeral needs...
livening up.
Oh.
Oh, it's beautiful.
No, e-every... everything's fine really.
We're all fine,
and the car's fine, and...
Oh, no. You stay where you are.
No, that wasn't Margene. That's, um...
Uh, never mind.
I should go.
I love you. Bye.
Aren't you gonna get it?
She might be worried.
She's getting what she wants.
Oh, I'm tired. I'm gonna turn in.
Good night.
Don't you think Arvilla's being...
Just a little bit... just a little...
I think... I think you're
doing really well.
Good night.
Do you remember this place, Joe?
We finally made it back.
I don't know what to do.
How many times
are you gonna clean this room?
I just don't like leaving a mess.
- Where'd you go last night?
- Bathroom.
For half an hour?
Arvilla, you don't know how
to drive one of those things.
You don't drive. You pilot.
And Joe said I did it better than he did.
Arvilla?
Arvilla, watch out for that...
Ow!
- The sandbar
- Oh, Lord!
- Oh, Lord. Take me now.
- Ow.
- Just get it over with.
- That's not funny.
They told us not to come this way.
They told us the water was low.
And they said
it was particularly low in this area.
I... They said it was way too low.
We're gonna ruin the funeral!
Oh, my God!
Don't you ever get tired
of always being right?
I'm not always right.
It must be exhausting being Carol Brimm,
everyone's moral conscience.
I just don't understand why you're trying
so hard not to get to Santa Barbara
when it's the whole reason
that we're on this trip.
And I don't understand why you're
so worried about Francine.
I am not worried about Francine.
I am worried about you.
Where do you think you're gonna live?
You need to take care of yourself.
I know how to take care of myself.
Oh, what... Like you're
taking care of us right now?
Take a look around. Oh, wait.
I forgot. We're having an adventure!
- Carol!
- Not if you've got anything to say about it!
My God! Wouldn't the world be so much simpler
if we could all live by your rules?
- Oh, Arvilla.
- The only rule I live by is the Golden Rule.
- Ah!
- I sure wouldn't do unto others what you are doing...
Stop it, you two, before you say
something you're gonna regret.
Oh!
Ow!
You all kiss and make up.
You better do it,
or I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna cook dinner.
Okay.
It's easy to judge
to think we know for certain
the right thing to do.
But sometimes
it just isn't so clear.
Margene!
Don't throw it overboard!
All you need to do is stir it!
I don't believe you did that!
- It's an old family recipe!
- The kitchen is destroyed.
Carol, it's not that bad!
You could have burned down
the whole boat.
Well, you didn't have to throw it overboard.
- What was it?
- Asphalt.
What was it supposed to be?
I don't know, but whatever it was,
at least we know water kills it.
Okay, Martha Stewart.
You make dinner.
Sandwiches? That's what
you're saving the day with?
They're lovely.
Uh-uh.
Dear father in heaven,
we thank thee for this food
and we thank thee for our many blessings
and for keeping us safe.
Bless Arlo and all our families
on Earth and in heaven.
- In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.
- Amen
See how sweet she is
when God's listening?
Yeah.
- Mmm. Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
That's delicious.
- Thank you.
- Oh, please! They're not that good.
Margene? Uh, Arvilla.
We're moving!
Oh.
Oh.
Arlo, you'll never guess in a million years
where I am right now.
- Good evening.
- Hello. We have a reservation.
Uh, Holden for three?
Could you make that four?
Hello. Hello.
You're late.
Thank you.
Well.
Your waiter will be right with you.
Where were we?
- Well...
- Uh, well.
Well.
Well, this is gonna be
an interesting evening.
I'm sorry. Excuse me, but you just have a little
thread right there, and I can get it for you.
Oh, dear. Oh.
- You bought a suit.
- Busted.
- I'm so sorry.
- Well...
And I told the principal
the kids know how
to reproduce just fine.
What they need help learnin'
is how not to.
But when I wouldn't back down,
he fired me.
No, he didn't fire you. You retired.
- I was fired.
- I didn't know that.
- I didn't know that either.
- Well, I've still got some surprises left in me.
Oh, I'll bet you do.
I'll take that bet.
We have to use the ladies' room.
We'll meet you outside.
- Thank you for dinner, Emmett. It was lovely.
- It's my pleasure.
- Yes, thank you.
- My pleasure indeed. My pleasure.
- Did you get enough to eat?
- I did.
- Oh, good.
- It was delicious.
- So...
- I talk too much.
Oh, no.
Did they actually fire you?
Well, yeah, I guess I've always had
a problem with authority figures.
More like authority's
got a problem with you.
Well, it takes one to know one.
Oh.
Like that tattoo, for starters.
I was a sailor in the navy.
Ah. Girl in every port.
A nuclear sub
doesn't put into port much.
I only had one girl.
Oh. Who was she?
Sarah Eagleheart.
We married right out of college,
and, uh, I bought an RV.
After I got out of the navy, we were gonna
see this country once and for all.
And, uh, Sarah died,
and, uh, I sold the RV,
bought the truck,
and hit the road.
Hmm.
Mmm.
What do you say we hit the town?
- Fine by me.
- Okay.
- Oh!
- Joe always bet 18.
- Okay. Put me on 18.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Okay. Yeah.
Oh!
- Hmm. He always lost.
- Well, thanks a lot.
- There are other machines.
- Oh. I don't gamble.
We all gamble.
Are you having fun?
- It doesn't seem like you are.
- Oh, I'm waiting for a client.
You're here on business?
Yes. Ah. And there it is.
Robert?
I'm Alison.
Try it.
On me.
Come on now.
Oh!
- Oh, my! Oh!
- Carol?
D- D-Did you see a woman in a black dress
walk right that way?
It was her dollar that won that!
- It's yours now, honey.
- Oh!
Oh, my goodness. I've never won
anything in my life! What do I do?
- The general manager will be right over.
- Okay! Oh!
- Carol?
- Sister girlfriend!
- Remember we promised to share our winnings!
- We did not!
Oh, my heck I think I just drank vodka!
- Oh!
- Arlo's gonna kill me.
Oh! Arlo, Arlo! I gotta call Arlo!
Gambling, vodka?
What's next? Go-go boys?
Go-go boys?
Carol?
Margene's not back yet.
Maybe she's having fun.
We don't even know him.
She's a big girl.
She can take care of herself.
Stop worrying.
- Go back to sleep.
- I can't.
I can't. I tried.
- You want an aspirin?
- No.
- You want some company?
- Okay.
- I can't keep that money.
- Oh, God, Carol. Don't be silly.
It's not really my money.
Well, she gave you the dollar.
I was gambling.
Yeah, but think of it this way.
Maybe you won for a reason.
I mean, you could always
buy something nice for Arlo.
- You miss him, don't you?
- Yeah, I do.
You know,
I'm really glad that you came.
Course, I didn't give you
much choice, did I?
- Arlo could use some new tools.
- Yeah?
I could start college accounts
for the grandkids
after I pay my tithing, of course.
- Well, what about something for yourself?
- I don't need anything.
Yeah.
It's true.
You really don't need anything.
Except maybe a sports car.
A little red sports car.
Ooh! Wouldn't that surprise people?
Oh, Sister Brimm, you're full of surprises.
- That's it You're done.
- Okay.
- Now your turn.
- All right.
All right, now, be careful
and don't get any in my eyes.
- Okay.
- All right.
Ooh, I'm making a mess of it, kind of.
Doesn't matter.
Don't worry about it.
This is hard for me.
Carol, it's only mud.
No, I mean the ashes.
It's only giving Francine part of Joe.
I know that, but...
I don't know. It's just something
I'm gonna have to live with.
You know?
Okay.
He took me dancing.
- Yeah?
- Yes.
Ooh!
Ah.
Haven't done that in 15 years.
Oh, that's too long.
Mm-hmm.
Where are your panty hose?
- I took 'em off. They got too hot.
- Oh.
We didn't do anything.
So, where is he now?
He's...
He's on his way to Palm Springs.
He has an early drop-off.
Are you gonna see him again?
- Well, he seems to think so.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Well...
What's the matter?
I'm just tired.
Mmm.
- Well, go to bed. Go to bed.
- Yeah.
- It's a long drive to Santa Barbara tomorrow.
- Yeah.
He told me he was a submarine captain.
Ooh.
A- Arvilla?
The road to Santa Barbara's
the other way.
Aren't you cutting it a little close, honey?
Tomorrow's the funeral.
I know what day it is!
There's just one more place
that I have to go.
We're going right near Palm Springs,
if you want to call Emmett.
- We'll be ready to go in a few minutes.
- Arvilla's filling the car, Carol's in the ladies' room.
- Come on!
Come on, lady!
Geez.
I dropped off that rig. You wait for me.
What's going on?
Take your sweet-ass time! Geez!
Now, what...
what would your mother say?
- Get in the truck.
- Sweet!
Excuse me. That's my purse.
What are you doing? Hey!
Give me that purse! Give me that!
Give it to me!
Get your hands off of me!
- Damn!
- Larry, get her off of me!
Give me that!
Give it...

My Vegas check is in there!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Lady, I oughta...
- Oh? What? You're gonna what?
- You're gonna what? Go! Get in the car!
- Larry, get in the truck.
Oh, my God! You crazy bastard!
My God!
Ohh!
Check your purse!
Okay Yeah, it's there. It's there.
Did that hurt?
No just felt like
you made really big stitches.
Could've given you a mirror and a needle
and let you do it yourself.
Told you to knock her out.
Carol, I knew you were trouble
the minute I laid eyes on you.
Hey. I'm the only trouble around here,
buster, and don't you forget it.
Come on. Let's get outside.
- Hospitals give me the creeps.
- Okay.
Arvilla, you gonna be okay?
Oh, yeah I'll take...
I- I'll look after Carol. Go ahead.
- No, don't touch it.
- Okay.
Thank you.
They're sweet together.
Oh, it's just the same. It hasn't changed.
What is that?
Sounds like a party.
Can we go see?
Oh, you go on ahead.
I'll be there in a minute.
You sure you're okay?
Oh, I'm fine.
Wait a minute. Wait.
- Carol.
- I'm done.
Dance with us.
We'll have a conga line.
Come on!
- Ah, yes.
- Whew.
- I'm gonna go check on Arvilla. Okay?
- Okay.
- He won't bite.
- Oh, yeah?
Boy.
What's on your mind?
Margene's my best friend,
and I don't want to see her get hurt.
Carol...
You don't know.
I've lost someone too.
So...
I do know.
Are you cold?
There you go.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
Okay, break it up.
Uh-oh. You found us out.
- It's time for bed.
- Yeah, I think so.
Yeah.
I think I might stay up for a while.
Okay.
Ooh.
- Good night.
- If you're gonna stay up, put this on.
Oh.
- Thanks.
- You okay?
Yeah. Thanks.
Thanks.
Whew.
Arvilla?
Arvilla.
- Where's Joe?
- I have him. I have him.
- Oh.
- We need to go.
Let's go, honey.
Oh, my.
- Here, I'll take...
- I've got him. It's okay. You wake up.
Whew.
You don't have to come.
Yes, I do.
Yes, you do.
Oh!
- Mmm.
- I'll see you in a week.
Mm-hmm.
Well...
You girls behave yourselves.
- Good-bye, Emmett! Thank you!
- My pleasure.
Take care!
Drive safe!
I tried again.
Still no answer.
How much farther is it?
Not far.
Pour some whiskey in your water.
Sugar in your tea.
- Hurry up! Hurry up!
- One of you is gonna have to drive,
so I can change.
Whew!
Oh, no!
Now we've done it
License and registration.
- Please. We're in a hurry.
- It's an emergency.
- Of course it is. Life or death?
- Death!
Thank you, everyone, for coming.
I'm sorry to have
kept you all waiting, but...
I was waiting for my father.
I'm sorry we're late.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Most of you remember Daddy from
the 50 years he spent in Santa Barbara.
Although he was gone for the last 20,
this was always his home.
Thank you for coming today,
to help the family remember him,
and say farewell.
I was going to eulogize my father,
but he wouldn't be
very interested in that.
Joe Holden never had
much patience for convention.
At an age when most men retire
he kept teaching, kept writing.
Arvilla.
I know this has been
a terrible ordeal for you as well.
Thank you,
for bringing Daddy home.
I'm okay.
Where is my father?
Where he wanted to be.
All the places that he loved,
including here with you.
I guess you all just got a good laugh
out of this, didn't you?
- No, that isn't... Please!
- No, we didn't.
I wish Daddy had never met you.
You...
Who do you think you are?
I want you out of Daddy's house!
Francine, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry God!
- I didn't want...
- I know. Let me drive.
I don't know what I was thinking.
Maybe you'd take the urn
and not look inside.
Or maybe what was left
would be memory enough.
A handful was enough for me.
I guess I hoped
it would be enough for you too.
Don't worry, honey.
You can live with me.
It's about time I cleared all that junk
out of the second bedroom.
- Yeah
- And we've got that apartment above our garage.
Uh-huh.
Where should we go?
Oh.
I'd like to take Joe
somewhere for a change.
You know, before I met him,
the only trip I'd ever been on was
with my...
my dad to Mexico.
There's this beach in Baja.
You promised us a beach.
- Yeah, I did.
- Mm-hmm.
Let's go!
Well, this is it.
Maybe things work out in ways
that we can't always understand.
I suppose.
I mean, look at Joe.
When he left Santa Barbara,
he never expected to live
the rest of his life in Pocatello.
Well, who expects that?
Or to die in Borneo?
But you know what?
I don't think he would've
changed a thing.
What do you think you're gonna do?
What?
I don't know.
I don't know. I-I-I...
I don't have to know.
Well, you're not alone.
Amen.
So I hope this letter finds you well, Francine,
and I do hope we speak again.
Just know that I never meant
to take your father away from you.
And if you want to know the truth,
I wanted to keep a part of him too,
just a little bit.
But Joe Holden was a man of the world.
Oh, and about the house.
I'll leave that up to you.
I have my friends
and my memories.
And a few places left to see.
Arvilla?
Yeah?
When I die,
I want you to cremate me
and scatter my ashes.
Go to hell, Margene.
