00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,302
Dear Francine,

3
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:51,099
please, ask yourself,

4
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,476
what would you have done?

5
00:00:54,519 --> 00:00:58,273
I did make a promise
to the man I loved.

6
00:01:01,943 --> 00:01:03,904
We're here.

7
00:01:08,117 --> 00:01:10,619
You're home, ma'am.

8
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:12,621
Hmm?

9
00:01:28,763 --> 00:01:31,433
Have you ever
tried to imagine that moment?

10
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,146
The day you come home alone.

11
00:01:47,783 --> 00:01:52,204
What was so full is suddenly so empty.

12
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:11,141
Joe would have hated that silence.

13
00:02:11,224 --> 00:02:14,478
He would have wanted a party.

14
00:02:14,561 --> 00:02:16,897
So I tried.

15
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,443
This was on our
very first field trip to Borneo.

16
00:02:22,695 --> 00:02:25,239
We had just started
doing our research.

17
00:02:25,322 --> 00:02:27,742
He really relied on you.

18
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:29,827
Oh! Excuse me!

19
00:02:31,537 --> 00:02:34,499
I was afraid you weren't coming.

20
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,086
Oh! Oh!

21
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:40,171
What happened to the box?

22
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:45,260
Well, the diet gave me the box

23
00:02:45,343 --> 00:02:48,346
to bring Joe’s ashes home from Borneo

24
00:02:48,388 --> 00:02:52,184
but he so loved that urn...

25
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:55,604
- It held the hearts of sa...
- Sacrificed warriors.

26
00:02:57,272 --> 00:03:00,025
We'll want to put him
in something more substantial.

27
00:03:06,157 --> 00:03:08,826
Arvilla, damn it.
Let me do those.

28
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,496
- Oh.
- Go visit with your company.

29
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:13,706
I can't take any more sympathy.

30
00:03:13,748 --> 00:03:16,084
When Ralph died,

31
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:18,712
I washed dishes nonstop for weeks.

32
00:03:18,795 --> 00:03:22,674
Eased the pain,
but ruined my hands.

33
00:03:22,757 --> 00:03:26,470
I don't know what
I would have done without you.

34
00:03:26,553 --> 00:03:30,057
Well, it was a choice
between Joe’s funeral

35
00:03:30,098 --> 00:03:32,726
and that stupid cruise
I saved 10 years for

36
00:03:32,768 --> 00:03:36,146
and I just figured that
the funeral would be more fun.

37
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:50,370
I know I owe you an answer, Francine,

38
00:03:50,453 --> 00:03:53,915
but you had no right
to try to take him.

39
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,252
You're his daughter, yes,

40
00:03:57,294 --> 00:03:59,671
but whatever you
might think of me,

41
00:03:59,755 --> 00:04:02,424
I was his wife.

42
00:04:04,635 --> 00:04:07,596
I don't suppose Daddy got to finish this.

43
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,102
No, but I have all his notes
I thought I might try.

44
00:04:15,271 --> 00:04:17,273
Mother typed his first two books.

45
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:19,108
I know.

46
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:22,278
She was always too ill to travel,
you know?

47
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,869
I've, um, made a list
of family heirlooms,

48
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:32,455
things that belong back home.

49
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,461
Um, and if you don't mind.

50
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:40,672
Daddy's ashes would be
much easier to carry onto the plane

51
00:04:40,756 --> 00:04:43,050
in, um, that box.

52
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,805
But, Fran... Francine,
I promised Joe...

53
00:04:47,846 --> 00:04:50,141
You're not gonna scatter his ashes.

54
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:52,810
He shouldn't even be ashes.

55
00:04:52,852 --> 00:04:55,354
No, but that's what he wanted.
He made me promise.

56
00:04:55,438 --> 00:04:58,900
We are laying him to rest in Montecito
a week from Saturday

57
00:04:58,983 --> 00:05:00,902
next to Mother.

58
00:05:02,028 --> 00:05:04,030
That's what he wanted.

59
00:05:04,114 --> 00:05:07,284
- No, but, Francine...
- It's in the will.

60
00:05:08,868 --> 00:05:11,371
We also need to discuss this house.

61
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,666
What? This house?

62
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,002
Daddy left it to me.

63
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:20,214
But this is our home.
We lived here for 20 years.

64
00:05:20,297 --> 00:05:22,549
- All... Everything we...
- Arvilla.

65
00:05:22,633 --> 00:05:25,511
You must have seen the will.

66
00:05:25,553 --> 00:05:28,055
Yes, but he made another will
after we were married.

67
00:05:28,097 --> 00:05:31,392
- Did you ever see it?
- Well...

68
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:45,866
Daddy didn't always
get around to things, did he?

69
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:51,622
Like retire back to Santa Barbara
to be near his grandchildren.

70
00:05:51,705 --> 00:05:54,249
Daddy gave you a wonderful life.

71
00:05:56,251 --> 00:06:00,422
Let me take him home,
and you can have this house.

72
00:06:02,258 --> 00:06:04,218
No.

73
00:06:08,222 --> 00:06:12,101
No. I-I'm sorry, Francine
I can't. Not tonight.

74
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,068
The service is a week from Saturday.

75
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:23,071
I will call you
to make the arrangements.

76
00:06:54,145 --> 00:06:56,147
Before I met Joe,

77
00:06:56,231 --> 00:06:59,067
I'd barely been out of Idaho.

78
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:02,195
He certainly changed that.

79
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,669
What would I do without him?

80
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:51,727
- Mrs Holden?
- Yes?

81
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,773
I'm Riva Fox. Your daughter called
and asked me to handle your sale.

82
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,152
I am so sorry for your loss.

83
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:05,241
You have such a lovely home.
May I come in?

84
00:09:05,283 --> 00:09:09,120
No. No, you may not.

85
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:12,332
I don't have a daughter.

86
00:09:12,415 --> 00:09:15,585
- But Mrs Packard...
- Is not my daughter.

87
00:09:18,046 --> 00:09:20,674
And my house is not for sale.

88
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,865
- Boy, they sure don't waste any time, do they?
- Oh.

89
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:46,034
Oh.

90
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:48,661
- What happened?
- It's Francine.

91
00:09:48,745 --> 00:09:52,749
She's threatening to sell the house
unless I give her Joe’s ashes.

92
00:09:52,832 --> 00:09:55,794
- What?
- She can't sell your house.

93
00:09:55,877 --> 00:10:00,507
Well, it's her house,
according to the will that she has.

94
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,051
I don't know. Um, Joe...

95
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,888
I was sure Joe made another will
when we got married

96
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:07,890
but I can't find it anywhere.

97
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:10,893
- Did you talk to your lawyer?
- Archibald Pratt.

98
00:10:10,976 --> 00:10:12,895
Oh, he's in a nursing home.

99
00:10:12,978 --> 00:10:14,980
Last time I saw him,
he called me Nana.

100
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:17,108
Well, but his files have to have...

101
00:10:17,191 --> 00:10:22,113
No, his files were in the basement
last spring during the flood.

102
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:24,699
- It's gotta be here somewhere.
- No, it's not.

103
00:10:24,782 --> 00:10:27,285
It's not.

104
00:10:27,368 --> 00:10:29,537
Believe me,
I've searched everywhere.

105
00:10:34,876 --> 00:10:39,506
Maybe God wants Joe
back with his family.

106
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:43,177
- God, I can't believe you said that Carol!
- I'm sorry I'm sorry, Arvilla.

107
00:10:43,218 --> 00:10:45,179
I didn't mean it like that.

108
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:51,519
Our marriage was everything to us.

109
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,729
We were inseparable.
You know that.

110
00:10:53,813 --> 00:10:55,940
Francine can't take that
away from you.

111
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:58,151
No, she can't take that
away from me.

112
00:10:58,234 --> 00:11:01,279
But she can't take away
your house either.

113
00:11:02,655 --> 00:11:06,076
Yes, but I promised Joe
that I would scatter his ashes.

114
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:11,373
He doesn't want to
be sealed up in a box.

115
00:11:11,456 --> 00:11:14,418
He wants to be out in the world.

116
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:19,631
Arvilla, Joe wouldn't want you
to lose this house.

117
00:11:24,345 --> 00:11:27,515
Well.

118
00:11:27,598 --> 00:11:32,061
I'm not packing Joe up
and dropping him off at the post office.

119
00:11:38,109 --> 00:11:40,069
Hello.

120
00:11:40,153 --> 00:11:42,155
Oh, hello, Arvilla.

121
00:11:43,698 --> 00:11:46,409
Good. Thank you I'll arrange to...

122
00:11:46,451 --> 00:11:48,412
What?

123
00:11:48,453 --> 00:11:51,915
Oh, no.
Really, you needn't come.

124
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:54,460
Oh no, of course you're invited.

125
00:11:54,543 --> 00:11:57,087
The service is a week from
Saturday at 1:00 pm.

126
00:11:57,171 --> 00:11:59,757
You can stay in the green bedroom.

127
00:11:59,798 --> 00:12:02,468
No, it's no trouble, I insist.

128
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:05,513
Yes just let me know your plans.

129
00:12:05,596 --> 00:12:07,640
Yes. Fine.

130
00:12:07,723 --> 00:12:09,642
Good-bye, Arvilla.

131
00:12:10,935 --> 00:12:13,313
- That was Arvilla.
- Mm-hmm.

132
00:12:13,396 --> 00:12:16,524
She's bringing Daddy's ashes.

133
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:18,526
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

134
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,612
- You're doing the right thing.
- Yeah?

135
00:12:20,654 --> 00:12:22,656
Especially going in person.

136
00:12:22,697 --> 00:12:25,784
- And we'll come with you.
- We'll what?

137
00:12:25,826 --> 00:12:28,954
Oh, no. You don't have to do that.

138
00:12:28,996 --> 00:12:30,956
Well, listen, sister.

139
00:12:30,998 --> 00:12:34,001
I was supposed to be on
the cruise of a lifetime this week.

140
00:12:34,084 --> 00:12:38,381
- You owe me a trip.
- Really?

141
00:12:38,464 --> 00:12:41,634
Oh!
Well, fine then.

142
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:43,678
Let's take a trip.

143
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:45,847
Well, we can fly out
of Salt Lake on Monday.

144
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,641
But the funeral
isn't until Saturday.

145
00:12:48,683 --> 00:12:52,645
Well, that gives us time
for Beverly Hills and the beach and...

146
00:12:52,729 --> 00:12:55,315
Ooh!

147
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,150
I'll make the arrangements.
It's my treat.

148
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,987
Rodeo Drive, here I come!

149
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:02,990
- All right!
- Oh!

150
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,790
Neither one of us should be
going on this trip.

151
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,711
- Oh, come on.
- I can't leave Arlo alone for a whole week.

152
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,215
Well, how would you know?
You haven't left his side since high school.

153
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,676
- I have so.
- Trips to the ladies' room don't count.

154
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:25,847
And when did you last have to
take care of a man, Miss Free-As-A-Bird?

155
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,516
Well, why do you think
I booked that stupid cruise?

156
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,354
I was hopin' to take care of a man
one more time before I die.

157
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,898
Oh, Margene.

158
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,667
I'm sorry, Joe.

159
00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:14,898
- Hey!
- Looking good there, Sister Brimm.

160
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,985
You too! Oh!

161
00:14:18,068 --> 00:14:21,030
Oh! Whoo! Arvilla!

162
00:14:21,113 --> 00:14:23,449
- You look like a new woman.
- Oh!

163
00:14:23,532 --> 00:14:25,451
Mom, wait.

164
00:14:26,577 --> 00:14:29,664
Oh, I packed a snack.

165
00:14:29,747 --> 00:14:31,916
For who, the Green Bay Packers?

166
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,918
Salt Lake's only three hours.

167
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,962
I thought you said
we were taking the Volvo.

168
00:14:36,045 --> 00:14:38,840
- Why don't you let me drive you to Salt Lake?
- Oh, no, Arlo, thanks.

169
00:14:38,923 --> 00:14:40,842
Women only from here on.

170
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:44,262
Well, then take our car.
This thing doesn't even have air bags.

171
00:14:44,304 --> 00:14:46,306
Sure it does. Three of them.

172
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:49,393
Come on. Come on.

173
00:14:49,476 --> 00:14:52,271
Go on. Have fun.
Heck, go a little crazy.

174
00:14:52,312 --> 00:14:55,441
- Shotgun!
- Bye.

175
00:14:55,482 --> 00:14:58,110
- Okay. You take care of him, all right?
- Arvilla.

176
00:14:58,152 --> 00:15:02,114
- There.
- Don't let anything happen to Joe

177
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:05,660
or Arvilla will be living
out of a shopping cart.

178
00:15:05,743 --> 00:15:09,455
- Evelyn, your father's pills are in the...
- I know where they are, Mom.

179
00:15:09,497 --> 00:15:11,791
If you let her finish,
you're gonna miss your plane.

180
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,335
We're six hours early
I think we'll be all right.

181
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:17,464
Don't forget your sunblock, Mom.

182
00:15:17,505 --> 00:15:19,633
Bye! Have fun!

183
00:15:19,674 --> 00:15:22,969
- Be careful, ladies.
- Bye! I'll miss you!

184
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:25,514
Joe's Bonneville...

185
00:15:25,597 --> 00:15:28,809
I'd never even driven that darn thing.

186
00:15:28,892 --> 00:15:33,105
To be honest,
I think I was going a little crazy.

187
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,692
Laughing one minute,
crying the next.

188
00:15:36,775 --> 00:15:39,528
- I was a mess.
- Oh! Ah!

189
00:15:39,612 --> 00:15:42,156
- Arvilla!
- Arvilla!

190
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,242
Whoa!

191
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,500
- Ooh.
- What?

192
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,214
Arvilla, what are you doing?

193
00:15:57,297 --> 00:15:59,800
Are you okay?

194
00:16:05,013 --> 00:16:08,559
Here I got these for the beach,
but, well...

195
00:16:08,642 --> 00:16:10,644
- What?
- You can use them now.

196
00:16:10,728 --> 00:16:12,646
Oh!

197
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,191
Oh! Oh!

198
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,944
- Oh!
- Oh, I love it!

199
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:21,406
That was so thoughtful.
This is my color too.

200
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:23,116
- Uh-huh.
- This will help with the hair

201
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,744
- Hello, Jackie O.
- Ooh.

202
00:16:26,828 --> 00:16:29,581
Let me get my glasses on.

203
00:16:29,664 --> 00:16:31,750
- You look like Grace Kelly.
- Oh, do I?

204
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:35,253
Fabulous. Okay. All right.

205
00:16:35,337 --> 00:16:38,340
- Here. Ready?
- Yes. Let me take Joe back.

206
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:41,218
- Okay.
- All right, girls.

207
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:44,263
Here we go.

208
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:48,392
All right.
California, here we come.

209
00:16:59,362 --> 00:17:01,906
Hey!

210
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,908
Yeah!

211
00:17:18,632 --> 00:17:21,468
- I wonder what the "L" stands for?
- Luscious.

212
00:17:21,552 --> 00:17:23,470
Oh, it's loser.

213
00:17:42,574 --> 00:17:46,077
- Wish this relic had a tape player.

214
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:48,622
Why?
Did you pack your eight-tracks?

215
00:17:48,705 --> 00:17:51,291
- I gave those to Goodwill.
- Did not.

216
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,335
I know you didn't.

217
00:17:57,381 --> 00:18:01,135
Margene!

218
00:18:01,218 --> 00:18:04,388
- That's coffee! Oh!
- What did you expect, chicken soup?

219
00:18:04,472 --> 00:18:07,934
- What kind of Mormon are you?
- The fun kind.

220
00:18:08,017 --> 00:18:11,396
Come on. You're not gonna
go to hell over a cup of coffee.

221
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:14,607
- Besides, if anybody's gonna fry, it's gonna be me.
- Don't say that.

222
00:18:14,691 --> 00:18:16,609
I drink coffee,

223
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:19,237
enjoy the occasional
medicinal scotch.

224
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:22,073
And I would give anything
to feel a man's...

225
00:18:22,157 --> 00:18:23,909
Oh, Margene.

226
00:18:23,992 --> 00:18:27,663
Big rig.

227
00:18:27,704 --> 00:18:30,040
Who put a nickel in you?

228
00:18:36,172 --> 00:18:38,132
You don't remember this?

229
00:18:38,215 --> 00:18:41,552
He locked us in the basement
so we couldn't get away.

230
00:18:41,636 --> 00:18:44,722
And then Rusty Marcen jimmied the window,
and we all climbed out and escaped.

231
00:18:44,806 --> 00:18:47,642
- Except for Tommy Scoefield, the little wuss.
- I don't remember.

232
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:50,270
- Oh, look!
- Oh-ho!

233
00:18:50,353 --> 00:18:51,938
Hi!

234
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:54,566
Oh, my word! They're so young.

235
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:58,278
Really takes you back, doesn't it?

236
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:06,036
Have you ever been to the Salt Flats?

237
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,123
No.

238
00:19:09,206 --> 00:19:11,667
Arvilla, we don't have time
to go sightseeing.

239
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,212
- We'll get a later flight It's okay.
- But Francine's expecting us.

240
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,758
- Who are you calling?
- I'm just calling Arlo.

241
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:22,720
Arlo said to have fun,
so have fun, damn it.

242
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:52,627
It's not the same.

243
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:57,090
- The same as what?
- Well, Joe and I stopped here on our honeymoon.

244
00:19:57,173 --> 00:19:59,801
It was perfectly dry then.

245
00:19:59,884 --> 00:20:04,431
There were amateur races that day

246
00:20:04,514 --> 00:20:08,685
and a driver let Joe
take his sports car for a run.

247
00:20:08,768 --> 00:20:11,938
I stood there and watched
as the man I just married

248
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,984
raced away at 150 miles an hour.

249
00:20:18,695 --> 00:20:21,031
- Tighten your seat belts.
- Why?

250
00:20:21,115 --> 00:20:24,618
'Cause I promised Arlo
I would get you back in one piece.

251
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:34,504
This is stupid!

252
00:20:34,587 --> 00:20:36,589
Oh! Oh!

253
00:20:36,673 --> 00:20:39,634
- No!
- Oh, no!

254
00:20:39,676 --> 00:20:43,513
- Yeah!
- This isn't funny! Oh, my goodness!

255
00:20:43,597 --> 00:20:47,642
Joe! Joe! Joe! Stop the car!

256
00:20:47,726 --> 00:20:49,853
Stop the car, damn it!

257
00:20:55,484 --> 00:20:59,321
Oh!

258
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:02,408
- Oh. Of course.
- Oh.

259
00:21:15,422 --> 00:21:17,590
Oh!

260
00:21:17,674 --> 00:21:20,635
I told you I didn't think
we should come.

261
00:22:01,178 --> 00:22:04,556
I suppose you think this is funny.

262
00:22:16,694 --> 00:22:20,072
- We're stranded.
- Don't worry. Everything's fine.

263
00:22:20,114 --> 00:22:22,909
No, it isn't.
Carol Brimm said "damn it".

264
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,079
I did not.
And don't you dare tell anyone.

265
00:22:28,957 --> 00:22:30,917
Someone will come by.

266
00:22:37,883 --> 00:22:40,177
We could die here.

267
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,805
Then we'll all go together.

268
00:22:44,306 --> 00:22:46,308
Found it?

269
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,352
Joe gave me this scarf.

270
00:22:51,397 --> 00:22:53,816
- Where'd you get that?
- It was under the front seat.

271
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,818
Oh.

272
00:22:58,488 --> 00:23:00,406
Oh.

273
00:23:09,207 --> 00:23:11,126
Aww.

274
00:23:11,209 --> 00:23:14,171
Bryce Canyon on our honeymoon.

275
00:23:23,138 --> 00:23:25,141
There's someone out there.

276
00:23:25,224 --> 00:23:27,476
- What?
- Carol's hallucinating.

277
00:23:27,518 --> 00:23:30,730
Look! No. Look, look!
Someone's out there.

278
00:23:32,106 --> 00:23:34,609
Oh.

279
00:23:38,446 --> 00:23:41,908
What should we do?

280
00:23:41,992 --> 00:23:44,035
Ooh Margene!

281
00:23:56,173 --> 00:23:59,885
- Need help?
- No, honey. We're just sunbathin'.

282
00:24:01,387 --> 00:24:03,889
Do you need help?

283
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:08,060
I'm Bo.

284
00:24:08,144 --> 00:24:11,940
I'm Arvilla.
Where did you come from?

285
00:24:12,023 --> 00:24:15,693
I'm hitchhiking.
I never been to the Salt Flats.

286
00:24:15,735 --> 00:24:18,071
It's breathtaking, ain't it?

287
00:24:19,573 --> 00:24:21,575
Here! Let me!

288
00:24:21,616 --> 00:24:23,535
Oh, thank you.

289
00:24:30,876 --> 00:24:33,212
Oh! Hallelujah!

290
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,093
Do you think it's safe?

291
00:24:39,176 --> 00:24:41,178
- Well...
- Oh!

292
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:50,563
What are you waitin' for,
an engraved invitation?

293
00:24:50,647 --> 00:24:52,899
Which direction are you heading?

294
00:24:52,982 --> 00:24:54,901
Does it matter?

295
00:24:54,985 --> 00:24:57,612
We're heading south.

296
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:01,241
So am I.

297
00:25:01,283 --> 00:25:03,285
Well, get in.

298
00:25:10,668 --> 00:25:13,170
Arvilla, wait.
You don't mean that we're...

299
00:25:13,254 --> 00:25:16,424
No, we're not driving all the way
to California in this thing.

300
00:25:16,465 --> 00:25:21,387
Joe had "this thing" overhauled
just last month. She's as good as new.

301
00:25:21,471 --> 00:25:23,598
- I wish we could all do that.
- No, I'm serious.

302
00:25:23,681 --> 00:25:26,226
- So am I.
- What about Francine?

303
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,437
Well, I'll call her.

304
00:25:29,521 --> 00:25:31,439
Uh...

305
00:25:31,523 --> 00:25:33,441
It works.

306
00:25:38,488 --> 00:25:40,866
It's her machine.

307
00:25:40,949 --> 00:25:44,411
Francine?

308
00:25:44,495 --> 00:25:48,666
This is Arvilla. Um... Um...

309
00:25:48,749 --> 00:25:51,585
I don't... We missed the flight

310
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:54,130
and, um...

311
00:25:54,172 --> 00:25:56,424
so we've decided to drive.

312
00:25:56,507 --> 00:25:59,344
Okay.

313
00:25:59,427 --> 00:26:02,722
You're my witnesses I called.

314
00:26:06,935 --> 00:26:08,812
How they grow.

315
00:26:08,854 --> 00:26:10,856
They neither toil nor spin.

316
00:26:10,897 --> 00:26:14,359
I was toiling and spinning in the car
on the way over to the station today.

317
00:26:27,081 --> 00:26:30,751
Don't worry.
He's not going anywhere.

318
00:26:32,211 --> 00:26:35,506
I just wish you hadn't given him the keys.
That's all.

319
00:26:38,092 --> 00:26:41,096
Okay. Three Trucker Specials.

320
00:26:42,472 --> 00:26:44,474
Thank you.

321
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:47,602
And a veggie sand.

322
00:26:56,236 --> 00:26:58,781
I don't think he can hear.
I'll go get him.

323
00:27:17,258 --> 00:27:21,137
It... It's a beautiful car.

324
00:27:22,222 --> 00:27:24,141
It was my husband's.

325
00:27:29,396 --> 00:27:34,068
Oh, uh, I thought you might
need a clean T-shirt.

326
00:27:34,109 --> 00:27:38,364
So, you're not from around here.

327
00:27:38,447 --> 00:27:42,076
- Nah
- Well, neither are we.

328
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,621
We're from Pocatello, Idaho.

329
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,624
Where are you headed, Bo?

330
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:50,043
New Mexico.

331
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,128
- What's in New Mexico?
- Hmm?

332
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,839
What's in New Mexico?

333
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:58,677
Family reunion.
And you? Vacation?

334
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,388
Oh, yeah. It's a regular joyride.

335
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:04,725
We're taking Arvilla's husband
back to her stepdaughter.

336
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,810
Oh.

337
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:09,271
Oh I'm sorry.

338
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:12,149
- See, Arvilla promised to scatter his ashes...
- Margene!

339
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:15,277
- He's not interested in this.
- But... But if she... if she does

340
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,864
Joe's daughter
will take away her house.

341
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:19,866
Oh.

342
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:28,416
Bo, be careful down there.

343
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,962
Are you sure you know what you're doing
with all those wires?

344
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:37,301
Whew! There!

345
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,013
That should do it.

346
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:45,142
Hmm.

347
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:47,770
Where do your parents live?

348
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:50,147
My father lives in New Mexico.

349
00:28:50,231 --> 00:28:53,276
- And your mother?

350
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:55,361
- She died when I was nine.

351
00:28:55,445 --> 00:28:58,031
- Oh, I'm sorry.

352
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,223
Oh, she's beautiful, Bo.

353
00:29:22,306 --> 00:29:25,893
- So beautiful.
- May I?

354
00:29:29,146 --> 00:29:31,357
- Oh.

355
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,654
- So your father raised you?

356
00:29:36,738 --> 00:29:40,867
- I raised myself.
- But someone must have been there to take care of you.

357
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:44,204
They met when he was on leave

358
00:29:44,287 --> 00:29:48,125
and she never heard from him again.

359
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:50,627
- But...
- But you found him.

360
00:29:53,672 --> 00:29:55,674
I promised my mom I would.

361
00:30:00,721 --> 00:30:02,640
Oh.

362
00:30:44,684 --> 00:30:46,602
Where are we?

363
00:30:46,686 --> 00:30:48,771
I don't know.

364
00:30:48,855 --> 00:30:51,983
I don't know, but I think
we've gone far enough for today.

365
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:54,819
I'm gonna find a motel.

366
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:58,031
We're gonna continue
on south tomorrow, Bo,

367
00:30:58,115 --> 00:31:00,951
if you want to keep riding with us.

368
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:03,620
Ladies!

369
00:31:03,745 --> 00:31:06,957
Thank you, but it's taken me
so long to get here

370
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:10,044
and I'm in kind of a hurry.

371
00:31:17,301 --> 00:31:20,012
Well, you ever get up to Pocatello,
you look us up.

372
00:31:20,096 --> 00:31:23,516
I mean it.
Come give an old lady a kiss.

373
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:29,481
Oh, Bo, here. Don't forget this.

374
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,692
You know what? Keep it.

375
00:31:32,776 --> 00:31:36,863
- Oh, Bo Don't be silly.
- Please, it's a gift.

376
00:31:36,947 --> 00:31:40,200
I could use the silence

377
00:31:40,284 --> 00:31:44,079
and you guys could use the tunes.

378
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:46,749
Well, then let me buy it.

379
00:31:46,832 --> 00:31:48,876
You gave me a ride, and that's fair.

380
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:54,173
You rescued us off the Salt Flats.

381
00:31:54,257 --> 00:31:56,843
We must be worth more than that.

382
00:31:58,344 --> 00:32:01,306
Please? Bo.

383
00:32:07,437 --> 00:32:10,065
Bo, take my Book of Mormon.

384
00:32:10,148 --> 00:32:13,277
You might find something good in it.

385
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:30,044
I got this one
from my first ride in Utah.

386
00:32:30,127 --> 00:32:32,964
And I've been offered two more.

387
00:32:35,842 --> 00:32:39,262
Keep yours.
It looks like it's special.

388
00:32:42,807 --> 00:32:46,478
Now, you be careful. There are
some dangerous people on the road.

389
00:32:46,561 --> 00:32:48,730
Ah! Like you three.

390
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,986
Uh...

391
00:32:54,069 --> 00:32:56,030
Here. Headphones.

392
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:05,081
I hope you find your father, Bo.

393
00:33:08,209 --> 00:33:10,294
At least I tried.

394
00:33:22,057 --> 00:33:24,101
And that was it...

395
00:33:24,184 --> 00:33:26,436
the moment I started to wonder.

396
00:33:26,478 --> 00:33:28,480
Was I wrong?

397
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,361
If a nine-year-old boy
could make a promise

398
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:38,407
and keep it all these years,

399
00:33:38,491 --> 00:33:40,451
shouldn't I?

400
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:04,893
Oh, Arvilla.

401
00:34:04,977 --> 00:34:09,023
Have you got any quarters?
Carol cut me off.

402
00:34:09,106 --> 00:34:11,317
Bless your little heart.

403
00:34:17,406 --> 00:34:20,159
- Ah Have you ever been to Bryce Canyon?
- No Why?

404
00:34:20,201 --> 00:34:22,161
It's so beautiful.

405
00:34:22,203 --> 00:34:24,163
Oh.

406
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:30,879
Joe and I drove the Bonneville
on the back roads

407
00:34:30,962 --> 00:34:34,841
all the way from Santa Barbara
to Pocatello.

408
00:34:34,925 --> 00:34:39,179
We always said we were gonna
go back for a second honeymoon,

409
00:34:39,263 --> 00:34:41,181
but...

410
00:34:46,145 --> 00:34:50,191
You planned this all along, didn't you?
You never intended to fly.

411
00:34:53,736 --> 00:34:56,864
Yeah. See for yourself.

412
00:35:01,202 --> 00:35:04,414
Come on. You have to try it!

413
00:35:10,587 --> 00:35:12,881
Oh.

414
00:35:29,232 --> 00:35:31,567
- Klepto.
- They're for Arlo.

415
00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:34,070
- He collects them.
- Yeah, sure he does.

416
00:35:34,153 --> 00:35:36,114
Come on. Get over here.

417
00:35:36,197 --> 00:35:39,784
- No, I'm busy.
- Carol's had enough adventure for one day.

418
00:35:41,286 --> 00:35:43,580
You two don't think I'm any fun,
do you?

419
00:35:43,663 --> 00:35:47,292
No, we think you don't think
you're any fun.

420
00:35:56,635 --> 00:36:00,306
Now you've done it!

421
00:36:08,106 --> 00:36:11,276
- Oh, thank you so much.
- Good as new.

422
00:36:13,444 --> 00:36:16,322
All right. Now, let's figure out...

423
00:36:22,454 --> 00:36:27,209
- You got coffee!
- I bought it for you.

424
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:34,008
- Ooh. Look who's here.

425
00:36:45,728 --> 00:36:47,647
Thanks.

426
00:36:53,486 --> 00:36:57,324
Mornin'. Uh, you probably
don't remember me.

427
00:36:57,407 --> 00:36:59,826
I'm Emmett Johnson.
That's my truck, and yest...

428
00:36:59,868 --> 00:37:02,371
We do remember you.

429
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:04,957
Your truck made quite an impression.

430
00:37:07,084 --> 00:37:09,837
Well, so do three beautiful women
in a convertible.

431
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,923
Uh...

432
00:37:13,007 --> 00:37:16,260
Look, I'm gonna go in there and eat.

433
00:37:16,344 --> 00:37:19,806
- I'd be honored if you'd join me for breakfast.
- Oh, no, we just ate

434
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:22,684
Well, how 'bout coffee?

435
00:37:22,767 --> 00:37:25,019
Yeah.

436
00:37:25,061 --> 00:37:29,566
Well, look, now, we seem to be heading in
the same direction down this road here

437
00:37:29,649 --> 00:37:32,110
and maybe we could have dinner
down the road?

438
00:37:32,194 --> 00:37:35,614
- Do you think?
- Oh, no... We've made other plans.

439
00:37:37,532 --> 00:37:39,993
Well, all right.
I'll let you go then.

440
00:37:40,077 --> 00:37:42,579
Safe trip.

441
00:37:42,663 --> 00:37:46,876
We are, um, going to be
in Las Vegas on Thursday.

442
00:37:48,627 --> 00:37:50,629
Are ya?

443
00:37:52,173 --> 00:37:55,009
- Anyplace special?
- Yes.

444
00:37:55,092 --> 00:37:59,806
Um, we're going to be
at the Riviera at 8:00.

445
00:37:59,889 --> 00:38:02,350
Riviera at 8:00.

446
00:38:02,434 --> 00:38:04,769
I'll see what I can do.

447
00:38:08,648 --> 00:38:12,402
Um, I'm Arvilla.

448
00:38:12,444 --> 00:38:16,990
And this... this is Margene.

449
00:38:17,074 --> 00:38:20,452
And, uh, that is Carol.

450
00:38:20,536 --> 00:38:24,540
Carol. Oh, hello.
Nice to meet ya.

451
00:38:24,623 --> 00:38:26,584
Safe travels.

452
00:38:37,846 --> 00:38:41,182
I can't believe you told him
where we were going!

453
00:38:41,266 --> 00:38:43,226
What if he shows up?

454
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:46,730
This from the woman
who wanted to go on the Love Boat?

455
00:38:46,772 --> 00:38:48,774
Oh, please.

456
00:38:48,857 --> 00:38:51,652
- You thought he was hot yesterday.
- That was yesterday.

457
00:38:51,735 --> 00:38:53,779
Today he's just a stranger in a truck.

458
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:56,323
- Oh. Let's get out of here.
- Wait. What are you doing?

459
00:38:56,407 --> 00:38:58,325
- I'm gonna drive.
- Oh, come on!

460
00:38:58,409 --> 00:39:00,369
- Come on. Joe would let me.
- No.

461
00:39:00,453 --> 00:39:03,122
Ah, suit yourself.

462
00:39:06,334 --> 00:39:08,294
But look,

463
00:39:08,378 --> 00:39:11,673
you gotta be careful
'cause this is really powerful.

464
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:20,765
The only other time Joe ever got my goat
was that stupid shrunken head.

465
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:23,852
"Look what I brought you
from New Guinea," he says.

466
00:39:23,935 --> 00:39:26,313
He thought it was perfect for you.

467
00:39:26,355 --> 00:39:29,733
Well, they probably could have
heard my scream in New Guinea.

468
00:39:36,323 --> 00:39:38,284
We were just fooling around.

469
00:39:38,367 --> 00:39:40,953
When Joe asked me to spread his ashes

470
00:39:41,037 --> 00:39:43,039
he didn't say where.

471
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:48,086
But now part of him
was out there on the Salt Flats.

472
00:39:48,169 --> 00:39:50,213
It was an accident,

473
00:39:50,296 --> 00:39:52,340
but he'd be happy to be there.

474
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:55,385
- Well, at least we didn't have
chemistry or hot lunch

475
00:39:55,468 --> 00:39:57,429
until my senior year.

476
00:39:57,512 --> 00:40:00,515
Aww.

477
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,690
Francine. Her special ring.

478
00:40:07,731 --> 00:40:10,693
Aw, that's mean.

479
00:40:13,195 --> 00:40:15,281
Joe... Joe picked it out.

480
00:40:15,364 --> 00:40:17,325
She's not answering.

481
00:40:19,035 --> 00:40:20,995
I think her message said "we".

482
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:24,040
You don't suppose she's bringing
that awful Margene?

483
00:40:24,082 --> 00:40:26,960
Well, that would liven things up.

484
00:40:27,043 --> 00:40:30,714
Just what Daddy's funeral needs...
livening up.

485
00:41:02,956 --> 00:41:04,916
Oh.

486
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:11,757
Oh, it's beautiful.

487
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,954
No, e-every... everything's fine really.

488
00:41:40,996 --> 00:41:44,457
We're all fine,
and the car's fine, and...

489
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:47,794
Oh, no. You stay where you are.

490
00:41:47,836 --> 00:41:50,547
No, that wasn't Margene. That's, um...

491
00:41:50,631 --> 00:41:53,300
Uh, never mind.

492
00:41:53,383 --> 00:41:55,511
I should go.

493
00:41:55,594 --> 00:41:57,596
I love you. Bye.

494
00:41:59,515 --> 00:42:02,393
Aren't you gonna get it?

495
00:42:02,476 --> 00:42:06,731
She might be worried.

496
00:42:06,814 --> 00:42:08,775
She's getting what she wants.

497
00:42:11,903 --> 00:42:14,197
Oh, I'm tired. I'm gonna turn in.

498
00:42:17,492 --> 00:42:19,411
Good night.

499
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:28,629
Don't you think Arvilla's being...

500
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,673
Just a little bit... just a little...

501
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:34,385
I think... I think you're
doing really well.

502
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,514
Good night.

503
00:43:29,609 --> 00:43:32,070
Do you remember this place, Joe?

504
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:39,453
We finally made it back.

505
00:44:14,656 --> 00:44:16,617
I don't know what to do.

506
00:44:56,450 --> 00:45:00,329
How many times
are you gonna clean this room?

507
00:45:00,413 --> 00:45:03,416
I just don't like leaving a mess.

508
00:45:03,499 --> 00:45:06,711
- Where'd you go last night?
- Bathroom.

509
00:45:06,794 --> 00:45:08,713
For half an hour?

510
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:47,837
Arvilla, you don't know how
to drive one of those things.

511
00:45:47,921 --> 00:45:50,423
You don't drive. You pilot.

512
00:45:50,507 --> 00:45:53,176
And Joe said I did it better than he did.

513
00:46:05,647 --> 00:46:07,900
Arvilla?
Arvilla, watch out for that...

514
00:46:07,983 --> 00:46:10,319
Ow!

515
00:46:10,402 --> 00:46:13,656
- The sandbar
- Oh, Lord!

516
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:15,866
- Oh, Lord. Take me now.
- Ow.

517
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:18,035
- Just get it over with.
- That's not funny.

518
00:46:29,381 --> 00:46:33,343
They told us not to come this way.

519
00:46:34,761 --> 00:46:37,598
They told us the water was low.

520
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:40,267
And they said
it was particularly low in this area.

521
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:43,687
I... They said it was way too low.
We're gonna ruin the funeral!

522
00:46:43,771 --> 00:46:45,981
Oh, my God!

523
00:46:46,065 --> 00:46:49,568
Don't you ever get tired
of always being right?

524
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:51,779
I'm not always right.

525
00:46:51,862 --> 00:46:54,949
It must be exhausting being Carol Brimm,
everyone's moral conscience.

526
00:46:55,032 --> 00:46:58,036
I just don't understand why you're trying
so hard not to get to Santa Barbara

527
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:00,121
when it's the whole reason
that we're on this trip.

528
00:47:00,205 --> 00:47:03,875
And I don't understand why you're
so worried about Francine.

529
00:47:03,958 --> 00:47:08,296
I am not worried about Francine.
I am worried about you.

530
00:47:08,338 --> 00:47:10,549
Where do you think you're gonna live?

531
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,471
You need to take care of yourself.

532
00:47:15,554 --> 00:47:17,890
I know how to take care of myself.

533
00:47:17,973 --> 00:47:20,809
Oh, what... Like you're
taking care of us right now?

534
00:47:20,851 --> 00:47:25,314
Take a look around. Oh, wait.
I forgot. We're having an adventure!

535
00:47:25,398 --> 00:47:29,235
- Carol!
- Not if you've got anything to say about it!

536
00:47:29,318 --> 00:47:34,574
My God! Wouldn't the world be so much simpler
if we could all live by your rules?

537
00:47:34,657 --> 00:47:37,994
- Oh, Arvilla.
- The only rule I live by is the Golden Rule.

538
00:47:38,077 --> 00:47:41,790
- Ah!
- I sure wouldn't do unto others what you are doing...

539
00:47:41,873 --> 00:47:46,878
Stop it, you two, before you say
something you're gonna regret.

540
00:47:49,923 --> 00:47:52,760
Oh!

541
00:47:52,843 --> 00:47:54,762
Ow!

542
00:47:56,347 --> 00:47:58,307
You all kiss and make up.

543
00:47:59,934 --> 00:48:02,186
You better do it,
or I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

544
00:48:03,854 --> 00:48:06,190
I'm gonna cook dinner.

545
00:48:09,736 --> 00:48:11,696
Okay.

546
00:48:15,033 --> 00:48:17,369
It's easy to judge

547
00:48:17,452 --> 00:48:21,373
to think we know for certain
the right thing to do.

548
00:48:22,958 --> 00:48:25,294
But sometimes

549
00:48:25,377 --> 00:48:27,337
it just isn't so clear.

550
00:48:36,055 --> 00:48:38,140
Margene!

551
00:48:38,224 --> 00:48:43,104
Don't throw it overboard!
All you need to do is stir it!

552
00:48:43,187 --> 00:48:45,356
I don't believe you did that!

553
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,234
- It's an old family recipe!
- The kitchen is destroyed.

554
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:51,738
Carol, it's not that bad!

555
00:48:51,821 --> 00:48:54,908
You could have burned down
the whole boat.

556
00:48:54,991 --> 00:48:58,245
Well, you didn't have to throw it overboard.

557
00:48:59,997 --> 00:49:02,916
- What was it?
- Asphalt.

558
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,960
What was it supposed to be?

559
00:49:05,043 --> 00:49:08,422
I don't know, but whatever it was,
at least we know water kills it.

560
00:49:08,464 --> 00:49:11,383
Okay, Martha Stewart.
You make dinner.

561
00:49:20,685 --> 00:49:24,689
Sandwiches? That's what
you're saving the day with?

562
00:49:25,982 --> 00:49:28,276
They're lovely.

563
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:30,779
Uh-uh.

564
00:49:35,075 --> 00:49:39,163
Dear father in heaven,
we thank thee for this food

565
00:49:40,873 --> 00:49:44,209
and we thank thee for our many blessings
and for keeping us safe.

566
00:49:45,294 --> 00:49:47,630
Bless Arlo and all our families

567
00:49:47,713 --> 00:49:50,633
on Earth and in heaven.

568
00:49:50,675 --> 00:49:53,761
- In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.
- Amen

569
00:49:53,803 --> 00:49:56,139
See how sweet she is
when God's listening?

570
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,182
Yeah.

571
00:49:59,684 --> 00:50:01,686
- Mmm. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

572
00:50:04,564 --> 00:50:07,067
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

573
00:50:08,485 --> 00:50:11,989
That's delicious.

574
00:50:12,072 --> 00:50:15,826
- Thank you.
- Oh, please! They're not that good.

575
00:51:12,051 --> 00:51:16,181
Margene? Uh, Arvilla.
We're moving!

576
00:51:19,351 --> 00:51:21,353
Oh.

577
00:51:24,231 --> 00:51:26,149
Oh.

578
00:51:34,366 --> 00:51:38,329
Arlo, you'll never guess in a million years
where I am right now.

579
00:51:56,515 --> 00:51:59,643
- Good evening.
- Hello. We have a reservation.

580
00:51:59,726 --> 00:52:01,728
Uh, Holden for three?

581
00:52:02,855 --> 00:52:04,898
Could you make that four?

582
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:06,900
Hello. Hello.

583
00:52:06,942 --> 00:52:08,944
You're late.

584
00:52:14,533 --> 00:52:17,203
Thank you.

585
00:52:17,286 --> 00:52:20,373
Well.

586
00:52:20,456 --> 00:52:22,917
Your waiter will be right with you.

587
00:52:27,964 --> 00:52:30,300
Where were we?

588
00:52:31,843 --> 00:52:34,680
- Well...
- Uh, well.

589
00:52:34,763 --> 00:52:36,306
Well.

590
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:40,894
Well, this is gonna be
an interesting evening.

591
00:52:40,978 --> 00:52:45,316
I'm sorry. Excuse me, but you just have a little
thread right there, and I can get it for you.

592
00:52:45,357 --> 00:52:47,359
Oh, dear. Oh.

593
00:52:48,861 --> 00:52:51,822
- You bought a suit.
- Busted.

594
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:56,661
- I'm so sorry.
- Well...

595
00:52:58,246 --> 00:53:00,248
And I told the principal

596
00:53:00,331 --> 00:53:02,959
the kids know how
to reproduce just fine.

597
00:53:03,043 --> 00:53:06,421
What they need help learnin'
is how not to.

598
00:53:06,504 --> 00:53:09,007
But when I wouldn't back down,
he fired me.

599
00:53:09,091 --> 00:53:11,635
No, he didn't fire you. You retired.

600
00:53:11,718 --> 00:53:14,304
- I was fired.
- I didn't know that.

601
00:53:14,346 --> 00:53:17,933
- I didn't know that either.
- Well, I've still got some surprises left in me.

602
00:53:18,017 --> 00:53:20,144
Oh, I'll bet you do.

603
00:53:20,227 --> 00:53:22,229
I'll take that bet.

604
00:53:24,523 --> 00:53:26,651
We have to use the ladies' room.

605
00:53:26,734 --> 00:53:28,694
We'll meet you outside.

606
00:53:28,736 --> 00:53:32,031
- Thank you for dinner, Emmett. It was lovely.
- It's my pleasure.

607
00:53:32,073 --> 00:53:35,076
- Yes, thank you.
- My pleasure indeed. My pleasure.

608
00:53:39,956 --> 00:53:42,125
- Did you get enough to eat?
- I did.

609
00:53:42,208 --> 00:53:44,127
- Oh, good.
- It was delicious.

610
00:53:44,211 --> 00:53:47,214
- So...
- I talk too much.

611
00:53:47,297 --> 00:53:49,633
Oh, no.
Did they actually fire you?

612
00:53:49,716 --> 00:53:53,887
Well, yeah, I guess I've always had
a problem with authority figures.

613
00:53:53,971 --> 00:53:58,058
More like authority's
got a problem with you.

614
00:53:58,142 --> 00:54:00,311
Well, it takes one to know one.

615
00:54:00,394 --> 00:54:02,647
Oh.

616
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:05,191
Like that tattoo, for starters.

617
00:54:06,609 --> 00:54:10,655
I was a sailor in the navy.

618
00:54:10,738 --> 00:54:12,740
Ah. Girl in every port.

619
00:54:12,824 --> 00:54:16,244
A nuclear sub
doesn't put into port much.

620
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:18,288
I only had one girl.

621
00:54:18,371 --> 00:54:21,917
Oh. Who was she?

622
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,462
Sarah Eagleheart.

623
00:54:29,133 --> 00:54:33,304
We married right out of college,
and, uh, I bought an RV.

624
00:54:33,387 --> 00:54:37,600
After I got out of the navy, we were gonna
see this country once and for all.

625
00:54:37,683 --> 00:54:40,019
And, uh, Sarah died,

626
00:54:40,102 --> 00:54:44,440
and, uh, I sold the RV,
bought the truck,

627
00:54:44,482 --> 00:54:47,151
and hit the road.

628
00:54:47,235 --> 00:54:49,237
Hmm.

629
00:54:50,488 --> 00:54:52,907
Mmm.

630
00:54:52,949 --> 00:54:55,285
What do you say we hit the town?

631
00:54:55,327 --> 00:54:57,287
- Fine by me.
- Okay.

632
00:55:00,207 --> 00:55:02,167
- Oh!
- Joe always bet 18.

633
00:55:02,251 --> 00:55:04,795
- Okay. Put me on 18.
- Yeah?

634
00:55:04,878 --> 00:55:06,797
Yeah.

635
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,633
Okay. Yeah.

636
00:55:11,343 --> 00:55:13,679
Oh!

637
00:55:13,763 --> 00:55:17,975
- Hmm. He always lost.
- Well, thanks a lot.

638
00:55:43,794 --> 00:55:47,840
- There are other machines.
- Oh. I don't gamble.

639
00:55:47,923 --> 00:55:49,759
We all gamble.

640
00:55:55,973 --> 00:55:58,851
Are you having fun?

641
00:55:58,935 --> 00:56:02,647
- It doesn't seem like you are.
- Oh, I'm waiting for a client.

642
00:56:02,731 --> 00:56:04,524
You're here on business?

643
00:56:05,734 --> 00:56:10,197
Yes. Ah. And there it is.

644
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:13,408
Robert?

645
00:56:13,492 --> 00:56:15,577
I'm Alison.

646
00:56:21,417 --> 00:56:23,377
Try it.

647
00:56:24,462 --> 00:56:26,881
On me.

648
00:56:37,308 --> 00:56:39,018
Come on now.

649
00:56:54,118 --> 00:56:58,164
Oh!

650
00:56:58,247 --> 00:57:00,958
- Oh, my! Oh!
- Carol?

651
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:04,670
D- D-Did you see a woman in a black dress
walk right that way?

652
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:07,090
It was her dollar that won that!

653
00:57:07,131 --> 00:57:09,550
- It's yours now, honey.
- Oh!

654
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:12,846
Oh, my goodness. I've never won
anything in my life! What do I do?

655
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:16,349
- The general manager will be right over.
- Okay! Oh!

656
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:19,561
- Carol?
- Sister girlfriend!

657
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:23,148
- Remember we promised to share our winnings!
- We did not!

658
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:27,402
Oh, my heck I think I just drank vodka!

659
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,947
- Oh!
- Arlo's gonna kill me.

660
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:32,867
Oh! Arlo, Arlo! I gotta call Arlo!

661
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,661
Gambling, vodka?
What's next? Go-go boys?

662
00:57:35,745 --> 00:57:37,747
Go-go boys?

663
00:58:06,485 --> 00:58:08,904
Carol?

664
00:58:10,156 --> 00:58:12,116
Margene's not back yet.

665
00:58:15,328 --> 00:58:17,288
Maybe she's having fun.

666
00:58:21,084 --> 00:58:23,086
We don't even know him.

667
00:58:24,838 --> 00:58:28,383
She's a big girl.
She can take care of herself.

668
00:58:29,634 --> 00:58:32,220
Stop worrying.

669
00:58:32,304 --> 00:58:34,348
- Go back to sleep.
- I can't.

670
00:58:34,431 --> 00:58:36,350
I can't. I tried.

671
00:58:45,526 --> 00:58:48,654
- You want an aspirin?
- No.

672
00:58:52,408 --> 00:58:55,870
- You want some company?
- Okay.

673
00:58:58,456 --> 00:59:02,752
- I can't keep that money.
- Oh, God, Carol. Don't be silly.

674
00:59:02,836 --> 00:59:04,838
It's not really my money.

675
00:59:04,879 --> 00:59:07,174
Well, she gave you the dollar.

676
00:59:07,215 --> 00:59:09,176
I was gambling.

677
00:59:09,217 --> 00:59:11,637
Yeah, but think of it this way.

678
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:14,681
Maybe you won for a reason.

679
00:59:17,309 --> 00:59:20,980
I mean, you could always
buy something nice for Arlo.

680
00:59:22,606 --> 00:59:25,568
- You miss him, don't you?
- Yeah, I do.

681
00:59:26,652 --> 00:59:29,447
You know,
I'm really glad that you came.

682
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:32,033
Course, I didn't give you
much choice, did I?

683
00:59:34,244 --> 00:59:37,038
- Arlo could use some new tools.
- Yeah?

684
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,416
I could start college accounts
for the grandkids

685
00:59:39,499 --> 00:59:41,501
after I pay my tithing, of course.

686
00:59:41,585 --> 00:59:45,422
- Well, what about something for yourself?
- I don't need anything.

687
00:59:48,091 --> 00:59:50,010
Yeah.

688
00:59:50,093 --> 00:59:52,930
It's true.
You really don't need anything.

689
00:59:54,723 --> 00:59:56,642
Except maybe a sports car.

690
00:59:56,725 --> 00:59:59,228
A little red sports car.

691
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:01,313
Ooh! Wouldn't that surprise people?

692
01:00:01,397 --> 01:00:04,775
Oh, Sister Brimm, you're full of surprises.

693
01:00:04,817 --> 01:00:07,653
- That's it You're done.
- Okay.

694
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:09,864
- Now your turn.
- All right.

695
01:00:18,123 --> 01:00:20,083
All right, now, be careful

696
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:22,085
and don't get any in my eyes.

697
01:00:22,127 --> 01:00:24,755
- Okay.
- All right.

698
01:00:28,467 --> 01:00:31,136
Ooh, I'm making a mess of it, kind of.

699
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:34,223
Doesn't matter.
Don't worry about it.

700
01:00:39,979 --> 01:00:42,064
This is hard for me.

701
01:00:42,148 --> 01:00:45,485
Carol, it's only mud.

702
01:00:45,568 --> 01:00:47,779
No, I mean the ashes.

703
01:00:52,283 --> 01:00:56,329
It's only giving Francine part of Joe.

704
01:01:04,296 --> 01:01:06,590
I know that, but...

705
01:01:11,053 --> 01:01:14,557
I don't know. It's just something
I'm gonna have to live with.

706
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,767
You know?

707
01:01:19,645 --> 01:01:21,648
Okay.

708
01:01:51,345 --> 01:01:53,514
He took me dancing.

709
01:01:53,556 --> 01:01:55,516
- Yeah?
- Yes.

710
01:01:55,558 --> 01:01:57,977
Ooh!

711
01:01:59,562 --> 01:02:01,397
Ah.

712
01:02:04,776 --> 01:02:06,736
Haven't done that in 15 years.

713
01:02:06,778 --> 01:02:10,073
Oh, that's too long.

714
01:02:10,115 --> 01:02:12,117
Mm-hmm.

715
01:02:13,827 --> 01:02:15,746
Where are your panty hose?

716
01:02:17,831 --> 01:02:21,418
- I took 'em off. They got too hot.
- Oh.

717
01:02:21,502 --> 01:02:23,796
We didn't do anything.

718
01:02:29,677 --> 01:02:31,596
So, where is he now?

719
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,598
He's...

720
01:02:33,681 --> 01:02:36,518
He's on his way to Palm Springs.

721
01:02:36,601 --> 01:02:39,020
He has an early drop-off.

722
01:02:43,233 --> 01:02:45,152
Are you gonna see him again?

723
01:02:45,235 --> 01:02:47,362
- Well, he seems to think so.
- Yeah?

724
01:02:47,446 --> 01:02:49,364
Yeah.

725
01:02:49,448 --> 01:02:51,366
Well...

726
01:02:54,954 --> 01:02:57,665
What's the matter?

727
01:02:59,458 --> 01:03:01,293
I'm just tired.

728
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:03,296
Mmm.

729
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:05,798
- Well, go to bed. Go to bed.
- Yeah.

730
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:09,010
- It's a long drive to Santa Barbara tomorrow.
- Yeah.

731
01:03:12,222 --> 01:03:15,725
He told me he was a submarine captain.

732
01:03:15,809 --> 01:03:18,144
Ooh.

733
01:04:03,317 --> 01:04:05,235
A- Arvilla?

734
01:04:05,319 --> 01:04:08,697
The road to Santa Barbara's
the other way.

735
01:04:08,739 --> 01:04:12,576
Aren't you cutting it a little close, honey?
Tomorrow's the funeral.

736
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:14,829
I know what day it is!

737
01:04:18,207 --> 01:04:21,336
There's just one more place
that I have to go.

738
01:04:41,148 --> 01:04:44,860
We're going right near Palm Springs,
if you want to call Emmett.

739
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:52,535
- We'll be ready to go in a few minutes.

740
01:04:52,577 --> 01:04:56,581
- Arvilla's filling the car, Carol's in the ladies' room.
- Come on!

741
01:04:59,167 --> 01:05:02,462
Come on, lady!
Geez.

742
01:05:02,545 --> 01:05:04,506
I dropped off that rig. You wait for me.

743
01:05:04,589 --> 01:05:06,591
What's going on?

744
01:05:06,675 --> 01:05:09,010
Take your sweet-ass time! Geez!

745
01:05:09,094 --> 01:05:11,555
Now, what...
what would your mother say?

746
01:05:20,189 --> 01:05:22,691
- Get in the truck.
- Sweet!

747
01:05:22,775 --> 01:05:24,944
Excuse me. That's my purse.

748
01:05:27,071 --> 01:05:29,449
What are you doing? Hey!

749
01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:32,368
Give me that purse! Give me that!

750
01:05:32,452 --> 01:05:34,078
Give it to me!

751
01:05:34,162 --> 01:05:36,623
Get your hands off of me!

752
01:05:36,706 --> 01:05:39,876
- Damn!
- Larry, get her off of me!

753
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:43,797
Give me that!

754
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,174
Give it...

755
01:05:46,258 --> 01:05:48,427
Get off, you stupid bat!

756
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:51,805
My Vegas check is in there!

757
01:05:51,889 --> 01:05:54,683
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

758
01:05:54,767 --> 01:05:57,520
- Lady, I oughta...
- Oh? What? You're gonna what?

759
01:05:57,603 --> 01:06:00,898
- You're gonna what? Go! Get in the car!
- Larry, get in the truck.

760
01:06:00,981 --> 01:06:03,067
Oh, my God! You crazy bastard!

761
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:05,069
My God!

762
01:06:05,153 --> 01:06:07,071
Ohh!

763
01:06:07,155 --> 01:06:09,073
Check your purse!

764
01:06:09,157 --> 01:06:12,076
Okay Yeah, it's there. It's there.

765
01:06:30,804 --> 01:06:32,598
Did that hurt?

766
01:06:32,681 --> 01:06:35,601
No just felt like
you made really big stitches.

767
01:06:35,684 --> 01:06:39,146
Could've given you a mirror and a needle
and let you do it yourself.

768
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:41,190
Told you to knock her out.

769
01:06:41,232 --> 01:06:45,194
Carol, I knew you were trouble
the minute I laid eyes on you.

770
01:06:45,278 --> 01:06:48,740
Hey. I'm the only trouble around here,
buster, and don't you forget it.

771
01:06:48,823 --> 01:06:51,034
Come on. Let's get outside.

772
01:06:51,117 --> 01:06:53,328
- Hospitals give me the creeps.
- Okay.

773
01:06:53,411 --> 01:06:55,288
Arvilla, you gonna be okay?

774
01:06:55,372 --> 01:06:59,293
Oh, yeah I'll take...
I- I'll look after Carol. Go ahead.

775
01:06:59,376 --> 01:07:01,336
- No, don't touch it.
- Okay.

776
01:07:02,379 --> 01:07:04,298
Thank you.

777
01:07:07,509 --> 01:07:10,554
They're sweet together.

778
01:07:37,916 --> 01:07:41,962
Oh, it's just the same. It hasn't changed.

779
01:07:47,176 --> 01:07:49,178
What is that?

780
01:07:49,261 --> 01:07:51,180
Sounds like a party.

781
01:07:51,264 --> 01:07:53,266
Can we go see?

782
01:07:55,351 --> 01:07:59,480
Oh, you go on ahead.
I'll be there in a minute.

783
01:08:01,483 --> 01:08:03,443
You sure you're okay?

784
01:08:03,485 --> 01:08:05,445
Oh, I'm fine.

785
01:09:26,738 --> 01:09:29,742
Wait a minute. Wait.

786
01:09:33,454 --> 01:09:35,414
- Carol.
- I'm done.

787
01:09:35,498 --> 01:09:37,416
Dance with us.

788
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,418
We'll have a conga line.

789
01:09:39,502 --> 01:09:41,671
Come on!

790
01:09:43,339 --> 01:09:45,258
- Ah, yes.
- Whew.

791
01:09:45,341 --> 01:09:48,636
- I'm gonna go check on Arvilla. Okay?
- Okay.

792
01:09:50,388 --> 01:09:53,016
- He won't bite.
- Oh, yeah?

793
01:10:04,486 --> 01:10:06,530
Boy.

794
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:21,462
What's on your mind?

795
01:10:24,591 --> 01:10:28,595
Margene's my best friend,
and I don't want to see her get hurt.

796
01:10:30,055 --> 01:10:31,973
Carol...

797
01:10:32,057 --> 01:10:33,850
You don't know.

798
01:10:36,687 --> 01:10:39,106
I've lost someone too.

799
01:10:39,189 --> 01:10:41,108
So...

800
01:10:43,193 --> 01:10:45,196
I do know.

801
01:10:54,789 --> 01:10:56,791
Are you cold?

802
01:11:02,338 --> 01:11:04,549
There you go.

803
01:11:04,633 --> 01:11:06,551
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

804
01:11:06,635 --> 01:11:08,553
Okay, break it up.

805
01:11:08,637 --> 01:11:10,555
Uh-oh. You found us out.

806
01:11:12,641 --> 01:11:15,060
- It's time for bed.
- Yeah, I think so.

807
01:11:15,144 --> 01:11:17,062
Yeah.

808
01:11:17,146 --> 01:11:19,565
I think I might stay up for a while.

809
01:11:19,648 --> 01:11:21,567
Okay.

810
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:23,569
Ooh.

811
01:11:23,652 --> 01:11:26,322
- Good night.
- If you're gonna stay up, put this on.

812
01:11:26,405 --> 01:11:28,324
Oh.

813
01:11:28,407 --> 01:11:30,326
- Thanks.
- You okay?

814
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:32,704
Yeah. Thanks.

815
01:11:32,787 --> 01:11:34,706
Thanks.

816
01:11:36,791 --> 01:11:39,794
Whew.

817
01:13:05,009 --> 01:13:07,219
Arvilla?

818
01:13:07,261 --> 01:13:09,263
Arvilla.

819
01:13:10,931 --> 01:13:14,185
- Where's Joe?
- I have him. I have him.

820
01:13:14,268 --> 01:13:16,646
- Oh.
- We need to go.

821
01:13:16,729 --> 01:13:18,731
Let's go, honey.

822
01:13:22,944 --> 01:13:24,863
Oh, my.

823
01:13:24,946 --> 01:13:28,283
- Here, I'll take...
- I've got him. It's okay. You wake up.

824
01:13:29,242 --> 01:13:31,244
Whew.

825
01:13:49,263 --> 01:13:52,683
You don't have to come.

826
01:13:52,767 --> 01:13:55,269
Yes, I do.

827
01:13:56,771 --> 01:13:59,774
Yes, you do.

828
01:14:01,234 --> 01:14:03,737
Oh!

829
01:14:10,953 --> 01:14:14,248
- Mmm.
- I'll see you in a week.

830
01:14:14,331 --> 01:14:16,375
Mm-hmm.

831
01:14:20,921 --> 01:14:22,631
Well...

832
01:14:25,009 --> 01:14:26,969
You girls behave yourselves.

833
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:33,851
- Good-bye, Emmett! Thank you!
- My pleasure.

834
01:14:33,935 --> 01:14:36,312
Take care!

835
01:14:36,354 --> 01:14:39,190
Drive safe!

836
01:14:39,316 --> 01:14:42,110
I tried again.

837
01:14:42,194 --> 01:14:44,112
Still no answer.

838
01:14:47,824 --> 01:14:49,743
How much farther is it?

839
01:14:49,827 --> 01:14:51,745
Not far.

840
01:14:51,829 --> 01:14:54,081
Pour some whiskey in your water.
Sugar in your tea.

841
01:15:02,715 --> 01:15:05,843
- Hurry up! Hurry up!

842
01:15:05,885 --> 01:15:09,722
- One of you is gonna have to drive,
so I can change.

843
01:15:12,892 --> 01:15:14,853
Whew!

844
01:15:24,905 --> 01:15:28,992
Oh, no!

845
01:15:29,076 --> 01:15:31,036
Now we've done it

846
01:15:38,669 --> 01:15:40,671
License and registration.

847
01:15:40,755 --> 01:15:42,673
- Please. We're in a hurry.
- It's an emergency.

848
01:15:42,757 --> 01:15:46,094
- Of course it is. Life or death?
- Death!

849
01:16:08,367 --> 01:16:10,619
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

850
01:16:12,121 --> 01:16:15,208
I'm sorry to have
kept you all waiting, but...

851
01:16:22,131 --> 01:16:24,134
I was waiting for my father.

852
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,202
I'm sorry we're late.

853
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:54,707
I'm sorry.

854
01:16:54,791 --> 01:16:56,709
Thank you.

855
01:17:11,934 --> 01:17:17,022
Most of you remember Daddy from
the 50 years he spent in Santa Barbara.

856
01:17:17,106 --> 01:17:19,858
Although he was gone for the last 20,

857
01:17:19,942 --> 01:17:22,778
this was always his home.

858
01:17:23,779 --> 01:17:25,698
Thank you for coming today,

859
01:17:25,781 --> 01:17:27,700
to help the family remember him,

860
01:17:27,783 --> 01:17:29,535
and say farewell.

861
01:17:31,371 --> 01:17:33,539
I was going to eulogize my father,

862
01:17:33,623 --> 01:17:36,042
but he wouldn't be
very interested in that.

863
01:17:36,084 --> 01:17:41,089
Joe Holden never had
much patience for convention.

864
01:17:41,172 --> 01:17:45,594
At an age when most men retire
he kept teaching, kept writing.

865
01:17:55,521 --> 01:17:58,441
Arvilla.

866
01:17:58,524 --> 01:18:02,820
I know this has been
a terrible ordeal for you as well.

867
01:18:02,904 --> 01:18:05,406
Thank you,

868
01:18:05,490 --> 01:18:07,492
for bringing Daddy home.

869
01:18:21,715 --> 01:18:24,009
I'm okay.

870
01:18:53,957 --> 01:18:56,084
Where is my father?

871
01:18:56,168 --> 01:18:58,337
Where he wanted to be.

872
01:19:00,964 --> 01:19:04,927
All the places that he loved,
including here with you.

873
01:19:08,722 --> 01:19:12,393
I guess you all just got a good laugh
out of this, didn't you?

874
01:19:12,476 --> 01:19:14,979
- No, that isn't... Please!
- No, we didn't.

875
01:19:15,062 --> 01:19:18,733
I wish Daddy had never met you.
You...

876
01:19:18,816 --> 01:19:20,985
Who do you think you are?

877
01:19:24,155 --> 01:19:26,658
I want you out of Daddy's house!

878
01:19:44,426 --> 01:19:46,429
Francine, I'm so sorry.

879
01:19:51,017 --> 01:19:54,145
I'm so sorry God!

880
01:19:55,855 --> 01:19:58,316
- I didn't want...
- I know. Let me drive.

881
01:20:04,531 --> 01:20:07,617
I don't know what I was thinking.

882
01:20:07,701 --> 01:20:11,288
Maybe you'd take the urn
and not look inside.

883
01:20:11,371 --> 01:20:14,708
Or maybe what was left
would be memory enough.

884
01:20:16,043 --> 01:20:18,379
A handful was enough for me.

885
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:22,675
I guess I hoped
it would be enough for you too.

886
01:20:27,096 --> 01:20:29,056
Don't worry, honey.

887
01:20:29,098 --> 01:20:31,059
You can live with me.

888
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:34,562
It's about time I cleared all that junk
out of the second bedroom.

889
01:20:34,646 --> 01:20:38,817
- Yeah
- And we've got that apartment above our garage.

890
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,860
Uh-huh.

891
01:20:51,246 --> 01:20:53,666
Where should we go?

892
01:20:53,749 --> 01:20:55,876
Oh.

893
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:59,171
I'd like to take Joe
somewhere for a change.

894
01:21:03,718 --> 01:21:05,887
You know, before I met him,

895
01:21:08,264 --> 01:21:11,851
the only trip I'd ever been on was

896
01:21:11,935 --> 01:21:13,895
with my...

897
01:21:15,188 --> 01:21:17,107
my dad to Mexico.

898
01:21:21,361 --> 01:21:24,907
There's this beach in Baja.

899
01:21:26,617 --> 01:21:28,577
You promised us a beach.

900
01:21:28,619 --> 01:21:31,121
- Yeah, I did.
- Mm-hmm.

901
01:21:36,919 --> 01:21:39,005
Let's go!

902
01:21:52,435 --> 01:21:55,605
Well, this is it.

903
01:21:59,526 --> 01:22:03,739
Maybe things work out in ways
that we can't always understand.

904
01:22:03,822 --> 01:22:05,699
I suppose.

905
01:22:05,783 --> 01:22:07,701
I mean, look at Joe.

906
01:22:07,785 --> 01:22:11,539
When he left Santa Barbara,

907
01:22:11,622 --> 01:22:14,542
he never expected to live
the rest of his life in Pocatello.

908
01:22:14,625 --> 01:22:16,419
Well, who expects that?

909
01:22:16,502 --> 01:22:19,797
Or to die in Borneo?

910
01:22:19,839 --> 01:22:21,799
But you know what?

911
01:22:21,841 --> 01:22:24,677
I don't think he would've
changed a thing.

912
01:22:27,097 --> 01:22:29,599
What do you think you're gonna do?

913
01:22:33,645 --> 01:22:36,648
What?

914
01:22:37,608 --> 01:22:39,651
I don't know.

915
01:22:43,113 --> 01:22:46,033
I don't know. I-I-I...

916
01:22:46,075 --> 01:22:48,202
I don't have to know.

917
01:22:49,704 --> 01:22:51,706
Well, you're not alone.

918
01:22:51,789 --> 01:22:54,333
Amen.

919
01:23:04,761 --> 01:23:08,557
So I hope this letter finds you well, Francine,

920
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:11,310
and I do hope we speak again.

921
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:17,942
Just know that I never meant
to take your father away from you.

922
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:23,990
And if you want to know the truth,

923
01:23:24,073 --> 01:23:27,326
I wanted to keep a part of him too,

924
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:29,370
just a little bit.

925
01:23:33,207 --> 01:23:37,212
But Joe Holden was a man of the world.

926
01:24:14,584 --> 01:24:18,088
Oh, and about the house.

927
01:24:18,171 --> 01:24:21,133
I'll leave that up to you.

928
01:24:21,174 --> 01:24:23,135
I have my friends

929
01:24:23,176 --> 01:24:25,470
and my memories.

930
01:24:27,473 --> 01:24:30,476
And a few places left to see.

931
01:24:34,855 --> 01:24:37,316
Arvilla?

932
01:24:37,358 --> 01:24:39,610
Yeah?

933
01:24:39,694 --> 01:24:41,654
When I die,

934
01:24:41,696 --> 01:24:45,658
I want you to cremate me
and scatter my ashes.

935
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:48,661
Go to hell, Margene.

936
01:24:49,305 --> 01:24:55,447
