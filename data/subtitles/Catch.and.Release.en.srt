1
00:00:26,658 --> 00:00:28,734
<i>You want to know
what I keep thinking about?</i>

2
00:00:29,077 --> 00:00:31,651
<i>That argument we had right before you left.</i>

3
00:00:31,914 --> 00:00:33,076
<i>Remember?</i>

4
00:00:34,124 --> 00:00:37,410
<i>There you are, heading off
for your big bachelor party fishing trip</i>

5
00:00:37,503 --> 00:00:40,706
<i>and I start in on you
like some hysterical fishwife,</i>

6
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:43,924
<i>insisting that you finish the seating chart
before you go.</i>

7
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,880
<i>What was I thinking?</i>

8
00:00:47,472 --> 00:00:49,714
<i>What I should have said
as you were leaving is, "I love you."</i>

9
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:55,348
<i>Or, at least... I don't know.
"Have fun. Be nice to the strippers."</i>

10
00:01:00,611 --> 00:01:04,230
<i>Instead, the last words
you heard me say were,</i>

11
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:05,611
<i>"Listen, pal,</i>

12
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,903
<i>"no more nookie until you figure out
where to put your mother's bridge club."</i>

13
00:01:43,449 --> 00:01:45,109
Our hearts go out to you.

14
00:02:12,814 --> 00:02:15,649
How you doing, Mrs. D?
You need anything?

15
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:19,352
A Scotch, but thin it out.
Don't let me get all Irish.

16
00:02:22,032 --> 00:02:25,532
- You boys were just lovely today.
- Oh, sorry.

17
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:28,616
My God.

18
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,873
He had good friends.

19
00:02:32,877 --> 00:02:35,166
He was a friend of yours?
The guy who died?

20
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,879
Yeah. We grew up together.

21
00:02:37,048 --> 00:02:38,543
So, you live here in Boulder?

22
00:02:38,717 --> 00:02:41,552
No. I moved away after high school.

23
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,594
- Where to?
- Los Angeles.

24
00:02:44,014 --> 00:02:48,059
- Oh, yeah? What do you do there?
- I make commercials.

25
00:02:48,352 --> 00:02:50,179
Is that a tattoo?

26
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,602
Maybe.

27
00:02:56,402 --> 00:02:58,810
<i>How could you leave me alone
with all these people?</i>

28
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:00,899
<i>You know I hate crowds.</i>

29
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,194
<i>And high heels.</i>

30
00:03:03,535 --> 00:03:06,109
<i>I'm wearing heels.
I don't know what I'm doing.</i>

31
00:03:06,705 --> 00:03:08,497
<i>I would if you were here.</i>

32
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:13,420
<i>You'd know how to make all these people
stop talking about you in the past tense,</i>

33
00:03:14,088 --> 00:03:15,915
<i>how to get your pervy uncle off me.</i>

34
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:17,923
<i>How could you leave me alone
with your pervy uncle?</i>

35
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:19,918
<i>You know I can't handle him.</i>

36
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:21,755
<i>I can't handle anything without you.</i>

37
00:04:03,683 --> 00:04:05,842
She say anything to you
about the honeymoon?

38
00:04:06,478 --> 00:04:09,479
- Like what?
- Like, is she still going to go?

39
00:04:10,607 --> 00:04:13,811
Alone in Kauai?
You think that's what she needs right now.

40
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:16,857
No, dude, not alone.
You know, with a friend.

41
00:04:17,198 --> 00:04:19,654
Because I think it'd be good for her
to get away.

42
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,399
That kind of thing could be really helpful.

43
00:04:25,206 --> 00:04:29,667
- Not me, Dennis. A friend. Anybody.
- Yeah. Somebody else.

44
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,219
Damn.

45
00:05:02,413 --> 00:05:03,742
Sock it to me.

46
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:08,201
Sock it to me. Sock it to me.

47
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,126
Sock it to me. Sock it to me. Sock it to me.

48
00:05:14,635 --> 00:05:16,627
Sock it to me. Sock it to me. Sock it to me.

49
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,428
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on.

50
00:05:19,348 --> 00:05:20,593
Butt cramp.

51
00:05:23,686 --> 00:05:24,765
Okay, go.

52
00:05:25,021 --> 00:05:27,393
Sock it to me. Sock it to me. Sock it to me.

53
00:05:27,482 --> 00:05:30,602
Sock it to me. Sock it to me. Sock it to me.

54
00:05:30,694 --> 00:05:32,936
Sock it to me!

55
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:35,361
Yeah! That's good!

56
00:05:37,534 --> 00:05:38,614
That's really good!

57
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:42,614
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

58
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:51,664
Employees must wash their hands
before returning to work.

59
00:05:59,016 --> 00:06:00,296
Call me,

60
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,138
Mr. Yummy.

61
00:06:05,272 --> 00:06:07,146
Okay. All right.

62
00:06:47,234 --> 00:06:48,314
Jesus!

63
00:06:49,028 --> 00:06:50,439
Oh, shit.

64
00:06:53,074 --> 00:06:54,153
Gray.

65
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:31,519
<i>You realise, since you weren't married,
Mrs. Douglas is the legal heir.</i>

66
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:33,858
We're just putting the estate in order.

67
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:36,609
Yep.

68
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:37,783
Okay.

69
00:07:39,332 --> 00:07:42,002
Now, did you and Mr. Douglas
share title on anything?

70
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,580
- Car, house?
- No, I'm in a rental.

71
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:49,879
Which I can't afford by myself. Wow.

72
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,471
We just found it. He hadn't even moved in.

73
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,262
Where's the paperwork for this big account?

74
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,137
What big account?

75
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:06,479
There's $48,000 on his tax return.
I'm not seeing any statements for it.

76
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,362
His savings had about that much, right?

77
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:14,327
No, the $48,000 is interest, Gray.

78
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:18,412
So, for an account to generate that,
the balance would have to be

79
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:21,328
roughly a million dollars.

80
00:08:23,338 --> 00:08:24,962
A million dollars?

81
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:27,290
Yeah, in some big investment account.

82
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:30,173
I bet you he inherited it
when his old man died.

83
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:34,339
You don't think it's a little weird
that he didn't tell us that he was rich?

84
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:37,304
Not really.
I mean, what business is it of ours?

85
00:08:37,394 --> 00:08:38,640
I was his partner.

86
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:41,980
Point is, Dennis, it wasn't business money.

87
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:43,810
You know? It was his money, so...

88
00:08:44,027 --> 00:08:45,521
He should've at least told you.

89
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:50,241
If it were me, if we were engaged
and I had a million bucks, there's no way...

90
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:54,703
Whoa. First off, this chick is only nice
to you because I'm your friend. Okay?

91
00:08:54,788 --> 00:08:59,000
Second off, you don't have two nickels to
rub together, sir. I've seen your ATM card.

92
00:08:59,084 --> 00:09:01,373
- I'm just saying.
- And I'm just saying

93
00:09:01,462 --> 00:09:04,962
there are hundreds,
thousands of really good reasons

94
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:08,917
my homeboy wouldn't have wanted to tell
everyone his dad left him a million bucks.

95
00:09:09,012 --> 00:09:10,554
Like what?

96
00:09:10,722 --> 00:09:15,883
Well, like, maybe he was afraid that
he'd become some kind of lazy dilettante

97
00:09:15,978 --> 00:09:20,355
if he had all that money at his access,
so he just put it away, just ignore it.

98
00:09:20,441 --> 00:09:22,849
But, hello! Come on!
Like he wasn't going to tell you?

99
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:27,736
I mean, I bet you he was just waiting to,
like, rock you with a big surprise.

100
00:09:27,824 --> 00:09:30,149
Because that was Grady's style.
He never did something small.

101
00:09:30,243 --> 00:09:35,036
It was just, plow! And, suddenly, he would
want to find a way to just spring it on you.

102
00:09:35,123 --> 00:09:36,404
You know? Like...

103
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:38,912
On your wedding night.

104
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,372
- You think so?
- Oh, God, yes!

105
00:09:42,464 --> 00:09:43,627
Picture this.

106
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,634
You guys are on the honeymoon. Okay?

107
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:50,591
You just had hours upon hours of sex,

108
00:09:50,682 --> 00:09:53,387
without me or Dennis in the house
for a change.

109
00:09:53,977 --> 00:09:58,141
And you're falling asleep
in one another's arms, cosying up to you.

110
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,308
<i>And he's like, "Um, Geege,</i>

111
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,944
<i>"remember the part of the vows
where we said, 'For richer or for poorer'</i>

112
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,448
<i>"We're the former!"</i>

113
00:10:09,118 --> 00:10:10,862
God, he would have loved doing that.

114
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:14,117
He would have.

115
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:25,507
Whoa. Running low, I see.
Gray, I'm going to take your last beer.

116
00:10:36,815 --> 00:10:40,350
<i>"Loss and possession,
death and life are one.</i>

117
00:10:40,444 --> 00:10:44,987
<i>"There falls no shadow
where there shines no sun."</i>

118
00:10:47,618 --> 00:10:48,816
Hilaire Belloc.

119
00:10:49,495 --> 00:10:50,658
Who's that?

120
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,531
I don't know, but it's an excellent quote
I put on the Red Zinger box.

121
00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:57,458
Thought it was appropriate. Shall we?

122
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:02,171
Oh, that's it, dude. I am so getting married.

123
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:05,213
This chick made out
like it was her bar mitzvah.

124
00:11:05,304 --> 00:11:08,673
- Oh, God. Put it back, Sammy.
- Why, dude? She's got, like, six of them.

125
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:12,135
Yeah. She's got, like, six of them.
Thank you.

126
00:11:12,228 --> 00:11:14,470
Why you got to be like that?
I'm just trying to feather our nest.

127
00:11:14,564 --> 00:11:16,022
You're just trying to feather your stomach.

128
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:19,476
You know what? That was hateful.
You're such a blatant sizeist sometimes.

129
00:11:20,904 --> 00:11:23,193
The thing's got, like, 82 settings, sir.

130
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:25,986
You and me could have a total waffle party,
because we...

131
00:11:26,743 --> 00:11:29,698
- What are you doing?
- She'll be more comfortable in bed.

132
00:11:29,788 --> 00:11:32,196
Are you serious?
Did you not see the pills kick in?

133
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,328
The only way she'd be more comfortable
is if you shot her with a tranq gun.

134
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:38,255
All I know is, she's not going to wake up
in the morning with a neck crick.

135
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:41,127
What are you talking about, a neck crick?
What are you, an osteopath?

136
00:11:41,217 --> 00:11:43,257
Oh, my God, you're actually picking her up!

137
00:11:43,345 --> 00:11:44,803
Dennis, you're scaring me, man.

138
00:11:44,888 --> 00:11:45,967
- Put the woman down.
- Get out of my way.

139
00:11:46,056 --> 00:11:49,425
No. Did it ever occur to you that maybe she
don't want to sleep in there without Grady?

140
00:11:49,518 --> 00:11:51,345
Did it occur to you
that I'm holding her right now?

141
00:11:51,437 --> 00:11:53,809
- Seriously, Sir Galahad, put her back.
- Lf you're not going to help...

142
00:11:53,898 --> 00:11:55,974
I'm much stronger than you
and even I don't want to pick her up.

143
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:57,727
- No, she's heavy.
- Put her on the couch!

144
00:12:04,826 --> 00:12:06,071
She's out.

145
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:09,654
- This was totally your fault.
- This is not my fault,

146
00:12:09,748 --> 00:12:10,911
- this is your fault.
- Clean this up.

147
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:14,250
You're not... I'm not... Come on.
Come on, dude.

148
00:12:14,336 --> 00:12:16,210
- Want a beer?
- Shut up.

149
00:12:40,823 --> 00:12:41,938
Okay.

150
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:12,310
Hey.

151
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:20,025
This is Grady's room. You have no right...
What are you doing here?

152
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:21,693
Sleeping.

153
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:23,237
What time is it?

154
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:29,619
I didn't feel like going home right away, so...

155
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:32,165
The guys said it'd be okay
if I crashed here for a while.

156
00:13:32,253 --> 00:13:34,745
Don't touch that. Just don't touch anything.

157
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,708
You think you can handle that, Mr. Yummy?

158
00:13:40,763 --> 00:13:42,554
I didn't know you were there.

159
00:13:47,937 --> 00:13:49,348
Why are you still here?

160
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,597
I thought you were supposed to be
in Los Angeles,

161
00:13:51,691 --> 00:13:53,185
directing a movie or something.

162
00:13:53,276 --> 00:13:55,068
No, that didn't work out.

163
00:13:55,153 --> 00:13:57,561
Which, you know, thank God.

164
00:13:57,906 --> 00:14:00,824
Movies, they're worse than commercials.

165
00:14:01,201 --> 00:14:05,698
Just sell, sell, sell.
But let's kid ourselves and call it art.

166
00:14:06,373 --> 00:14:11,083
At least in ads it's sell, sell, sell,
but we all know we're going to hell.

167
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:14,421
So here's a fat ass cheque
to smooth out the ride.

168
00:14:16,885 --> 00:14:19,756
I never understood
why he was friends with you.

169
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:23,256
You don't even seem like you miss him.

170
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:56,758
Hi, I'm the administrator of the estate
of a client of yours who passed away.

171
00:14:57,804 --> 00:15:01,802
I need copies of his statement accounts
for the last three... Yes, I'll hold.

172
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,680
- Gray. Gray.
- Yeah?

173
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,315
I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am.

174
00:15:14,655 --> 00:15:15,936
Thank you.

175
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:22,242
You know, a similar thing happened
to a friend of my cousin's.

176
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:25,116
Young guy, skiing.

177
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,959
Some kid on a snowboard comes up,
totally out of control...

178
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,210
Bam.

179
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,836
Snowboard severed his jugular.

180
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:35,844
Blood all over the slope.

181
00:15:36,846 --> 00:15:40,345
And then, you know, people started
to ski over it, so it spread down the hill.

182
00:15:43,687 --> 00:15:44,885
Anyway.

183
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:58,736
So, a peace garden for Grady.

184
00:15:59,662 --> 00:16:03,660
Yeah, you know. At the fly shop.
In that space behind the truck?

185
00:16:05,293 --> 00:16:08,959
So it's kind of, then, more like
a peace parking spot than anything else.

186
00:16:09,047 --> 00:16:10,376
Shut up, dude.

187
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:13,461
He'd be all over it.

188
00:16:13,552 --> 00:16:16,222
- I don't think so, cookie.
- Well, I do.

189
00:16:16,764 --> 00:16:18,887
And I knew him better than you did, so...

190
00:16:19,267 --> 00:16:20,725
What?

191
00:16:21,227 --> 00:16:22,852
Are you serious?

192
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:26,563
Oh, my God, Dennis, like, I may not have
been the dude's business partner, okay,

193
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:28,891
- but, like, me and Grady were tight, sir.
- Okay, okay.

194
00:16:28,985 --> 00:16:30,065
Very tight.

195
00:16:31,196 --> 00:16:35,609
In fact, I just happen to know he told me
stuff that he would never tell you.

196
00:16:36,035 --> 00:16:38,277
Stuff I bet you never thought
would leave the walls

197
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,612
of your super-secret fly-fishing shop.

198
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,333
Like what?

199
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:46,410
- What stuff?
- Just stuff stuff, Dennis!

200
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:48,912
Just work stuff. Stuff about work.

201
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,877
All right. You're drinking too much.
Give me that.

202
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:54,464
Are you...

203
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,176
That's your big move.

204
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,925
<i>"You're drinking too much.
Going to take your pole."</i>

205
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:02,015
- You know what? I guess the best offence...
- Is a good defence.

206
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:06,106
Did you even go into work today, assface,

207
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,027
or did you just hang around
and get loaded?

208
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,275
Not that it's any of your business,

209
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,652
but I took a mental health day,
if you must know.

210
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:18,369
I'm depressed, all right?
My best friend just died.

211
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:21,789
Oh, I'm sorry, he wasn't my best friend.
He was your best friend.

212
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,416
Hey. Are these things hard to use?

213
00:17:28,091 --> 00:17:29,170
No.

214
00:17:33,471 --> 00:17:34,847
- Jackass!
- Sorry.

215
00:17:34,931 --> 00:17:36,971
I think the hill was a good idea.

216
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:39,182
I think the hill was an excellent idea.

217
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:48,856
Come on, Dennis!

218
00:17:49,781 --> 00:17:50,895
What?

219
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,908
If you don't hurry up, I'm going to
burn this stuff on principle alone.

220
00:17:53,993 --> 00:17:56,033
I'm not listening to you
until you're fully dressed.

221
00:17:56,204 --> 00:17:59,371
Gray lady down,
just in time for the barbecue.

222
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,285
You're not going to believe this.

223
00:18:01,668 --> 00:18:04,420
- He transferred $3,000 out.
- Yup.

224
00:18:04,505 --> 00:18:06,213
- Every month?
- Yup.

225
00:18:06,882 --> 00:18:08,425
And you don't know
whose account it went to?

226
00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:10,418
Nope. Do you?

227
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,715
Me? No idea.

228
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:15,594
- Sammy, do you know?
- First I heard of it.

229
00:19:00,482 --> 00:19:04,314
You know, not for nothing,
but we could totally use a blender.

230
00:20:26,032 --> 00:20:28,025
Supper, supper, supper, supper.

231
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:30,408
Supper, supper, supper, supper.

232
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:34,078
- Supper, and nothing for Fritzie-time!
- God.

233
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,909
- Check it out.
- Oh, Sammy.

234
00:20:36,126 --> 00:20:38,534
- You didn't need to do this.
- You're right. I didn't, but,

235
00:20:38,629 --> 00:20:40,954
<i>"What comes from the heart
goes to the heart."</i>

236
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,047
Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

237
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:44,539
Tummy Mint?

238
00:20:45,553 --> 00:20:49,172
No, that would be the Celestial Seasonings'
Echinacea Complete Care.

239
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:50,677
Excellent guess.

240
00:20:52,477 --> 00:20:55,681
Let me ask you a question. It ain't going to
freak you out, staying in here?

241
00:20:55,772 --> 00:20:56,971
In what way?

242
00:20:57,357 --> 00:21:00,893
You know, in the way that he's not...
You know...

243
00:21:02,238 --> 00:21:04,277
I'm pretty clear on that fact, Sam.

244
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:07,070
Get your feed on.

245
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,403
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

246
00:21:17,713 --> 00:21:18,630
Dennis!

247
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,223
Oh, God.

248
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:51,663
Either answer it or turn it off.

249
00:21:54,878 --> 00:21:56,289
That's not mine.

250
00:21:57,714 --> 00:21:59,043
Whose is it?

251
00:22:05,472 --> 00:22:07,097
Maybe it is. Let me see.

252
00:22:09,936 --> 00:22:11,264
Ten missed calls.

253
00:22:11,354 --> 00:22:13,347
- I can figure that out.
- Ten's a lot.

254
00:22:13,439 --> 00:22:14,982
Here. Let me...

255
00:22:17,277 --> 00:22:20,444
Messages. Select. Listen to messages.

256
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:24,315
If you don't know whose it is,
you probably shouldn't listen to those.

257
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:25,690
I know whose it is.

258
00:22:32,335 --> 00:22:33,414
Okay.

259
00:22:42,888 --> 00:22:44,382
<i>Hey, Grady. It's me.</i>

260
00:22:44,473 --> 00:22:48,720
<i>So, it's the fourth and I kind of have
my landlord breathing down my back here.</i>

261
00:22:48,811 --> 00:22:51,847
<i>So, not to be Miss Tragedy about it,</i>

262
00:22:51,939 --> 00:22:56,233
<i>but I could be in some real trouble
if I don't get this money.</i>

263
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,892
<i>Okay, this isn't funny, Grady!</i>

264
00:22:59,113 --> 00:23:00,608
<i>I didn't even want your help.</i>

265
00:23:00,699 --> 00:23:04,198
<i>You were the one who wanted to be
Mr. Take Care Of Everything Man.</i>

266
00:23:04,286 --> 00:23:06,955
<i>Well, F you, sugar daddy. F you!</i>

267
00:23:23,056 --> 00:23:26,556
<i>You know what I need,
so go ahead, give it to me.</i>

268
00:23:46,248 --> 00:23:47,576
You're funny.

269
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:50,579
Okay, wait a minute.

270
00:23:51,086 --> 00:23:52,995
I'm going to ask you a question.

271
00:23:54,214 --> 00:23:55,377
What do you

272
00:23:56,717 --> 00:23:59,291
think when you hear someone say,

273
00:24:01,013 --> 00:24:03,635
<i>"Go ahead, give it to me"?</i>

274
00:24:09,439 --> 00:24:10,637
I've got this.

275
00:24:13,277 --> 00:24:14,439
Hi.

276
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:20,482
- I'm taking you home.
- No, you're not.

277
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:25,906
I am a grown-ass woman.
I don't need you to Hollywood me home.

278
00:24:43,017 --> 00:24:44,345
What are you doing?

279
00:24:45,228 --> 00:24:47,933
I'm just trying to figure out
what's more tragic,

280
00:24:48,022 --> 00:24:50,692
if this is your laundry or hers.

281
00:25:16,928 --> 00:25:18,589
I had nothing to do with it.

282
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,882
So, what are we painting today?

283
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,852
Where's the 323 area code for?

284
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,356
He's on my bed.

285
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:14,897
You know her, don't you?
323, that's L.A. You know her.

286
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:16,904
Right?

287
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:21,038
How long has she been in his life?
Just tell me that.

288
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:24,285
- She's not.
- Forget it. You suck.

289
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:26,914
She's not in his life. She's just...

290
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,750
The mother of his kid.

291
00:26:41,353 --> 00:26:42,681
Do you need anything?

292
00:26:43,438 --> 00:26:46,108
What I need is a little more information

293
00:26:46,567 --> 00:26:48,476
about how my fiancé

294
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:51,821
could have a child
that I know nothing about.

295
00:26:53,783 --> 00:26:56,321
Okay. It was...

296
00:26:58,621 --> 00:27:00,281
It was a one-time thing.

297
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:03,370
He was in town.

298
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,793
We went to a Halloween party.
He hooked up with this woman.

299
00:27:08,841 --> 00:27:10,549
When? How long ago?

300
00:27:11,051 --> 00:27:12,462
Before you.

301
00:27:12,553 --> 00:27:15,305
- How old is the kid?
- I don't know. Seven? Eight?

302
00:27:16,015 --> 00:27:17,806
- Is it a boy or a girl?
- Boy.

303
00:27:18,518 --> 00:27:19,680
God!

304
00:27:23,022 --> 00:27:24,932
- Want to sit down?
- No.

305
00:27:31,365 --> 00:27:32,693
What is she like?

306
00:27:33,826 --> 00:27:35,106
I don't know.

307
00:27:35,202 --> 00:27:37,160
- Is she pretty?
- I don't know.

308
00:27:37,705 --> 00:27:39,579
- Answer me.
- She's attractive,

309
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:43,167
in a messed-up, makeup-y kind of way.

310
00:27:44,838 --> 00:27:47,708
She doesn't swear. What is that?

311
00:27:48,175 --> 00:27:49,420
What kind of...

312
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:52,760
<i>What kind of grown woman
goes around saying "F you"?</i>

313
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:55,682
The kind with a kid.

314
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:02,189
Great.

315
00:28:10,866 --> 00:28:13,024
This is why you're still here, isn't it?

316
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,368
To clean up after him.

317
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:22,626
You have blue paint in your hair.

318
00:28:23,838 --> 00:28:27,005
It's not blue. It's Marrakech Mystery.

319
00:28:31,221 --> 00:28:34,056
- Why is she calling?
- She wants her money.

320
00:28:35,058 --> 00:28:36,387
What do you mean?

321
00:28:36,643 --> 00:28:37,972
He sent her money.

322
00:28:38,896 --> 00:28:42,265
She hasn't gotten any lately,
what with him being dead and all.

323
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,727
She's effing p.o.'ed.

324
00:28:50,492 --> 00:28:53,943
I'll take care of it.
I'll send her some money myself.

325
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,659
I think she counts on it.

326
00:28:57,249 --> 00:28:58,660
For rent and stuff.

327
00:29:01,837 --> 00:29:05,004
I counted on him, too. Look where it got me.

328
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:16,810
Incidentally, I do.

329
00:29:19,857 --> 00:29:21,137
Miss him.

330
00:29:30,994 --> 00:29:32,571
Yeah. Los Angeles?

331
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:37,574
Okay, I need the number
and the street address

332
00:29:37,918 --> 00:29:39,709
for Maureen Monette.

333
00:29:41,505 --> 00:29:42,880
Thank you.

334
00:29:47,094 --> 00:29:50,428
Hey. You probably don't remember me.
My name's Fritz.

335
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:53,971
I'm a friend of Grady Douglas'

336
00:29:54,269 --> 00:29:56,890
I have some news.

337
00:29:57,897 --> 00:30:00,056
Paul Hexter, please. Fritz Messing calling.

338
00:30:00,942 --> 00:30:02,105
Thank you.

339
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:04,893
- Excuse me.
- Hey! Yeah, sorry I didn't call you back.

340
00:30:04,988 --> 00:30:10,743
I need you to send $20,000
to a massage therapist in Encino.

341
00:30:13,915 --> 00:30:15,243
Hello.

342
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:16,871
Hi.

343
00:30:18,545 --> 00:30:20,205
It's so good to see you.

344
00:30:20,881 --> 00:30:22,505
Nice to see you, too.

345
00:30:23,425 --> 00:30:24,670
Thanks for calling.

346
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:27,921
Before we eat,
I brought you a little something.

347
00:30:30,683 --> 00:30:32,011
Go on, open it.

348
00:30:36,022 --> 00:30:37,302
Gosh, Ellen.

349
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:39,058
It was my great aunt's

350
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,357
and the setting is very rare.

351
00:30:42,362 --> 00:30:45,363
And I want you to have it.

352
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:50,534
It's so special. It's so beautiful.

353
00:30:51,705 --> 00:30:55,869
I just wanted you to have something
to remember us by.

354
00:30:56,711 --> 00:30:58,704
And that ring, well...

355
00:31:00,006 --> 00:31:03,506
The stone has been in our family
for six generations.

356
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,878
And I know, now that you won't be

357
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:09,891
in the family...

358
00:31:11,602 --> 00:31:14,638
I know
you wouldn't be comfortable keeping it.

359
00:31:24,032 --> 00:31:26,819
Are you asking
for my engagement ring back?

360
00:31:31,498 --> 00:31:33,491
Grady gave me this ring.

361
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:41,212
It was a symbol of our decision
to spend the rest of our lives together.

362
00:31:42,218 --> 00:31:44,888
Yes, but you didn't spend
the rest of your life with him.

363
00:31:47,766 --> 00:31:49,924
He spent the rest of his with me.

364
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:55,440
I don't know what to say.

365
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,688
I'm going to go.

366
00:32:46,829 --> 00:32:48,537
What is it with this town?

367
00:32:49,165 --> 00:32:51,573
Everyone's so happy all the time.

368
00:32:52,377 --> 00:32:54,417
And people aren't happy in Los Angeles?

369
00:32:54,504 --> 00:32:59,463
Not like this.
This is like a Patagonia Disneyland.

370
00:33:00,594 --> 00:33:02,219
Maybe they're all medicated.

371
00:33:02,304 --> 00:33:04,796
You hear about that, you know,
towns where everybody's on Prozac?

372
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,967
Sounds pretty good. When can I move?

373
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:08,258
Bad day?

374
00:33:09,062 --> 00:33:11,185
- Not great.
- What happened?

375
00:33:12,273 --> 00:33:14,480
I was attacked by a mountain lion.

376
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,899
- Seriously?
- Oh, sort of. Kind of.

377
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:20,694
Hey, I...

378
00:33:21,992 --> 00:33:23,652
I have something for you.

379
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:30,120
It was Grady's.

380
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:33,037
I thought you might want it.

381
00:33:33,713 --> 00:33:36,121
- Lf you don't, you don't have to...
- No. No. Thank you.

382
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,185
Sporty.

383
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,063
I have to get back to work.

384
00:33:58,156 --> 00:34:00,991
Tragic widow. Right?

385
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:06,405
If you can't blow off work now,
when can you?

386
00:34:12,046 --> 00:34:13,754
I used to take pictures all the time.

387
00:34:14,215 --> 00:34:15,674
Why'd you stop?

388
00:34:16,009 --> 00:34:19,378
I started getting paid for it.
Took all the fun out.

389
00:34:27,146 --> 00:34:28,723
I owe you an apology.

390
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:31,643
Just one?

391
00:34:33,486 --> 00:34:36,606
I mean the funeral. Sorry I ruined it for you.

392
00:34:39,325 --> 00:34:42,742
Yeah, if it hadn't been for you,
that would've been one great day.

393
00:34:44,956 --> 00:34:46,237
I just...

394
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:52,619
Didn't want to be there, you know?
I wanted to be anywhere but there.

395
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:55,206
- You know?
- I know.

396
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,385
I mean, hey, if the other caterer
hadn't been gay, who knows?

397
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,797
I might've been doing
the same thing myself.

398
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,980
- Probably not.
- Yeah, probably not.

399
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:27,868
So, what are we doing tomorrow?
A little hiking? Mountain biking?

400
00:35:28,587 --> 00:35:30,995
I can't skip work two days in a row.

401
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:33,129
Of course you can.
You can do whatever you want.

402
00:35:34,218 --> 00:35:35,712
I don't know.

403
00:35:35,803 --> 00:35:39,006
I do. Trust me. Hooky looks good on you.

404
00:35:41,434 --> 00:35:44,601
Hey, check it out!
Grady just won $10 million.

405
00:35:45,772 --> 00:35:47,314
That worked out well.

406
00:35:48,692 --> 00:35:50,269
What the hell are you doing?

407
00:35:51,111 --> 00:35:53,270
Little party, sir.

408
00:35:53,363 --> 00:35:54,526
Jesus.

409
00:35:57,576 --> 00:36:01,621
Sammy, did you take some of these?
How many of these did you take?

410
00:36:02,456 --> 00:36:05,126
Hey. You dumbass. All right.

411
00:36:05,209 --> 00:36:08,376
Come on, Sammy, get up. Come on.
We're getting up and we're walking.

412
00:36:08,463 --> 00:36:10,954
- Come on, buddy. Get up. Get up.
- All right, all right.

413
00:36:14,887 --> 00:36:16,049
Sammy?

414
00:36:28,443 --> 00:36:30,400
Those were my pills, Sam.

415
00:36:31,738 --> 00:36:35,902
If anyone's going to use them to check out,
it's going to be me.

416
00:36:38,245 --> 00:36:39,443
Sorry.

417
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:45,749
I knew it was a bad idea.

418
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:49,626
Which? I mean, the vodka, the pills
or the combo?

419
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:52,289
The trip.

420
00:36:52,886 --> 00:36:54,713
And I almost told him.

421
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:59,593
You know, like, so many times,
I was this close to saying,

422
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:04,643
<i>"Come on, dude.
That pass, like, in a flat-bottom boat?</i>

423
00:37:05,858 --> 00:37:08,812
<i>"Not even you, you know?
That's just crazy dangerous.</i>

424
00:37:08,903 --> 00:37:11,110
<i>"Don't do it, sir."</i>

425
00:37:13,032 --> 00:37:14,776
And who knows, you know?

426
00:37:16,036 --> 00:37:19,072
Maybe just this one time he might be, like...

427
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:22,792
<i>"You're right, Sambo.</i>

428
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:27,046
<i>"Let's just shitcan
the great outdoors this weekend,</i>

429
00:37:27,131 --> 00:37:29,883
<i>"stay home, rock some PlayStation instead."</i>

430
00:37:37,851 --> 00:37:39,808
It's not your fault.

431
00:37:40,479 --> 00:37:42,471
I just miss him so much.

432
00:37:46,902 --> 00:37:49,275
He was just the man, you know?

433
00:37:52,366 --> 00:37:53,481
Move.

434
00:37:56,663 --> 00:37:58,074
Scoot over.

435
00:38:04,505 --> 00:38:08,668
Oh, man, I don't want to alarm you,
but you just totally pulled my I.V. Out.

436
00:38:26,862 --> 00:38:29,068
Oh, my God, you painted!

437
00:38:30,115 --> 00:38:31,444
The walls were disgusting.

438
00:38:31,617 --> 00:38:33,657
It doesn't even really look like
his room anymore.

439
00:38:36,706 --> 00:38:38,699
It looks like a Tampax box!

440
00:38:41,044 --> 00:38:42,787
The doctor said he'd be sluggish.

441
00:38:43,213 --> 00:38:46,748
Yeah, how about selfish?
Did the doctor say he'd be selfish?

442
00:38:47,885 --> 00:38:49,545
Let's take it a little easy on the guy,

443
00:38:49,636 --> 00:38:51,843
what with him trying to kill himself
and everything.

444
00:38:51,931 --> 00:38:54,089
A few sleeping pills is not a suicide attempt.

445
00:38:54,225 --> 00:38:56,383
It's just his way to get out of
helping with the peace garden.

446
00:38:56,602 --> 00:39:00,434
If he'd really wanted to end it all, he'd have
gone out and gotten himself a gun.

447
00:39:00,523 --> 00:39:02,563
They're not hard to come by.
This is America.

448
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,901
You guys go on ahead and get started
and I'll bring Sam in a few.

449
00:39:05,987 --> 00:39:07,731
No, you have to be there.
They're expecting you.

450
00:39:07,823 --> 00:39:09,068
I said I'll come.

451
00:39:20,336 --> 00:39:22,245
So, this peace garden,

452
00:39:22,714 --> 00:39:25,287
bringing a lot of peace into your life so far?

453
00:39:29,221 --> 00:39:31,379
That's good. That's funny.

454
00:39:33,475 --> 00:39:35,018
Sam, you almost ready?

455
00:39:51,787 --> 00:39:53,411
Oh, excuse me.

456
00:39:53,622 --> 00:39:55,449
Hi. Can you tell me...

457
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:59,124
I'm looking for someone who knows
something about Grady Douglas.

458
00:40:08,596 --> 00:40:10,007
They're not here.

459
00:40:10,098 --> 00:40:11,473
What?

460
00:40:16,563 --> 00:40:17,892
Well, who are you?

461
00:40:19,775 --> 00:40:22,147
I'm the cleaning woman.

462
00:40:22,778 --> 00:40:26,230
Okay, well, can you tell
whoever's dealing with things

463
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:28,115
that I really need to talk to them?

464
00:40:30,078 --> 00:40:31,869
Here, let me give you my card.

465
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:40,870
Does that game just end
or is it just going on forever?

466
00:40:40,965 --> 00:40:45,176
You know when you just put everything in
the thing and you just can't find the one...

467
00:40:46,929 --> 00:40:49,088
Here's me. I'm Maureen.

468
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:52,674
Yeah.

469
00:40:54,688 --> 00:40:58,021
And we're staying
at the Silver Saddle Motel, okay?

470
00:40:58,191 --> 00:40:59,437
Thanks.

471
00:41:01,403 --> 00:41:02,732
Come on, honey!

472
00:41:06,659 --> 00:41:08,616
He's not eight, is he?

473
00:41:09,162 --> 00:41:11,035
- What?
- Your son.

474
00:41:12,332 --> 00:41:16,626
He's not a very small eight-year-old, is he?

475
00:41:17,087 --> 00:41:20,290
No. He'll be four in October. Why?

476
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:33,265
Eight?

477
00:41:33,354 --> 00:41:36,391
God, the kid's practically in diapers!

478
00:41:42,072 --> 00:41:43,235
Come here.

479
00:43:34,109 --> 00:43:37,443
Yes, party people,
let's get this bitch in the ground!

480
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:40,021
Right? To the roots! Let's plant a tree, man.

481
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:42,986
With the D-Man, where you going?
Where you going, Dennis?

482
00:43:45,997 --> 00:43:47,456
Wait...

483
00:43:47,874 --> 00:43:50,081
Oh, my God, how'd it get to be night out?

484
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:55,038
Oh, Lord. I missed it, didn't I?

485
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,635
Well, that's unfortunate.

486
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:08,391
Yo.

487
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:12,392
I think he blew off, hon.
He's on that biking trip again.

488
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:14,234
Let me get a message from you.

489
00:44:18,407 --> 00:44:19,735
Persephone.

490
00:44:21,285 --> 00:44:22,400
Okay.

491
00:44:22,495 --> 00:44:25,282
Hey, man, how's it going down there?
Is it hot?

492
00:44:26,624 --> 00:44:28,035
Persephone.

493
00:44:29,085 --> 00:44:32,086
She's a Greek deity.
She's the goddess of the underworld?

494
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:34,081
You know what? Forget it. Too complicated.

495
00:44:34,174 --> 00:44:36,795
I'm just going to tell him that you called.

496
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:39,254
And he will be so pleased.

497
00:44:40,222 --> 00:44:41,966
All right. Bye-bye.

498
00:44:45,978 --> 00:44:47,223
I mean,

499
00:44:48,314 --> 00:44:51,315
it's not like I called her Antigone
or something. Jesus.

500
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:54,188
Oh, yes!

501
00:44:56,031 --> 00:44:58,189
The glorious morning in the corn!

502
00:45:25,062 --> 00:45:28,478
So, yeah, it wasn't before you,

503
00:45:28,566 --> 00:45:31,520
it was more during you.

504
00:45:32,737 --> 00:45:34,694
But it was only just that once, right?

505
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,110
<i>Say "yes," please.</i>

506
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:42,246
Hey, I could.

507
00:45:42,497 --> 00:45:46,246
Believe me, I can bullshit
until the cows come home, but...

508
00:45:50,423 --> 00:45:51,833
How many times?

509
00:45:55,511 --> 00:45:57,504
I wasn't really keeping count.

510
00:45:58,932 --> 00:46:00,509
When did it start?

511
00:46:02,894 --> 00:46:04,852
When he started coming out to L.A.
For work.

512
00:46:05,355 --> 00:46:08,226
He wouldn't see her
every time he went out there, though...

513
00:46:08,317 --> 00:46:09,597
Would he?

514
00:46:15,032 --> 00:46:16,693
Wow, wow.

515
00:46:17,952 --> 00:46:20,075
Oh, this is bad. This is...

516
00:46:21,998 --> 00:46:23,541
It's really bad.

517
00:46:26,044 --> 00:46:27,669
Was it still going on?

518
00:46:28,088 --> 00:46:29,251
No.

519
00:46:30,549 --> 00:46:32,174
Not as far as I know, anyway.

520
00:46:40,435 --> 00:46:42,428
She's really sexy, isn't she?

521
00:46:44,731 --> 00:46:45,894
Naw.

522
00:46:46,733 --> 00:46:48,062
No, she is.

523
00:46:51,321 --> 00:46:52,401
No.

524
00:47:06,129 --> 00:47:07,458
About that

525
00:47:08,131 --> 00:47:09,590
other thing.

526
00:47:53,972 --> 00:47:55,597
That's impossible.

527
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,887
The mother is a massage therapist
in Los Angeles.

528
00:47:59,353 --> 00:48:02,271
Well, she's lying. Grady wasn't that stupid.

529
00:48:02,481 --> 00:48:04,189
Well, he was sending her money.

530
00:48:06,152 --> 00:48:09,106
He probably felt sorry for her.
He was very generous.

531
00:48:09,197 --> 00:48:11,320
I saw the kid. He looks just like him.

532
00:48:14,202 --> 00:48:17,157
You could show me 10 toddlers
and I would find

533
00:48:17,748 --> 00:48:20,239
similarities between each of them
and Grady.

534
00:48:21,126 --> 00:48:22,585
I'm sure I could.

535
00:48:26,799 --> 00:48:28,424
I talked to Eve.

536
00:48:29,302 --> 00:48:33,051
In Colorado, in the absence of a will,
a child is the sole heir.

537
00:48:33,306 --> 00:48:35,382
Therefore, this boy will get everything.

538
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:43,099
How the hell did you let this happen?

539
00:48:43,526 --> 00:48:44,688
Me?

540
00:48:45,695 --> 00:48:47,687
Wait, how am I at fault here?

541
00:48:48,281 --> 00:48:49,941
No satisfied man

542
00:48:50,867 --> 00:48:52,943
goes screwing cocktail waitresses.

543
00:48:54,245 --> 00:48:55,704
I'm calling Eve.

544
00:48:57,165 --> 00:49:00,083
That kid isn't getting one cent
of my son's money

545
00:49:00,168 --> 00:49:02,375
without coughing up some damn good DNA.

546
00:49:06,217 --> 00:49:09,052
Okay, all right. Come on, man!
That's not yours.

547
00:49:09,136 --> 00:49:12,553
This ain't funny anymore, kid!
$500 piece of equipment!

548
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,550
All right, put the... Kid, look at me.

549
00:49:14,642 --> 00:49:17,430
I am not in shape enough
to chase you around this house.

550
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,724
- Hey, kid, this is not your shit, man!
- What is the problem?

551
00:49:20,816 --> 00:49:23,223
The problem is your kid is like
an earthquake in short pants.

552
00:49:23,318 --> 00:49:24,694
- He's all over the joint.
- That's his playfulness.

553
00:49:24,778 --> 00:49:28,563
You have to be at ease. If you're at ease,
then he'll be at ease.

554
00:49:28,657 --> 00:49:30,531
- What?
- Hi.

555
00:49:31,577 --> 00:49:33,237
You didn't give anybody my message.

556
00:49:33,371 --> 00:49:34,913
What is she doing here?

557
00:49:35,623 --> 00:49:37,118
Hey, Gray. This is...

558
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:40,827
I know who she is. I didn't ask who she is.
I asked what she's doing here.

559
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:44,215
- Boiling water.
- Wait, you know who this is?

560
00:49:44,299 --> 00:49:46,257
There's no hot water at the Silver Saddle?

561
00:49:46,343 --> 00:49:49,878
Not boiling, and I need boiling water
for my herbal tea.

562
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:52,632
Because I have to realign my chi.

563
00:49:52,725 --> 00:49:54,385
Stop it! Stop it!

564
00:49:56,229 --> 00:49:57,427
The water's ready.

565
00:50:05,822 --> 00:50:08,278
What are you looking at? We're just talking.

566
00:50:09,952 --> 00:50:11,577
What's going on here?

567
00:50:12,288 --> 00:50:13,782
Am I missing something?

568
00:50:26,011 --> 00:50:29,214
- You're not the cleaning lady?
- Cleaning lady?

569
00:50:32,643 --> 00:50:34,102
What'd you come for?

570
00:50:34,645 --> 00:50:36,472
I just told you, I'm

571
00:50:37,773 --> 00:50:39,102
making tea.

572
00:50:39,192 --> 00:50:40,769
Because the money's his.

573
00:50:41,736 --> 00:50:44,144
One quick DNA swab and he gets it all.

574
00:50:45,782 --> 00:50:47,822
What are you talking about? What money?

575
00:50:49,703 --> 00:50:52,740
What the H-E-double L is she talking about?

576
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:58,752
I'm going out. When I come back,
it would be great if she weren't here.

577
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:07,209
That was awkward.

578
00:51:11,184 --> 00:51:12,679
Here, take this.

579
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:14,264
I'm not a charity case.

580
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,768
No, keep it. Call it a loan.
I know you're good for it.

581
00:51:23,406 --> 00:51:26,028
I didn't even know he was rich, okay?

582
00:51:26,117 --> 00:51:29,533
All I knew is that he wanted to
support his kid and that's why I came.

583
00:51:29,621 --> 00:51:31,614
To just make sure that
that was going to happen,

584
00:51:31,707 --> 00:51:34,910
not to, you know,
run off with all his money or

585
00:51:36,378 --> 00:51:37,956
upset his girlfriend.

586
00:51:38,339 --> 00:51:39,833
<i>It's "fiancée."</i>

587
00:51:41,258 --> 00:51:43,002
I didn't even know about her.

588
00:51:45,179 --> 00:51:48,762
I mean, I figured, you know,
that there was someone.

589
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,011
But he never said he was engaged.

590
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:12,329
You know, it makes sense, though,
her being like that.

591
00:52:13,293 --> 00:52:14,787
Like what?

592
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,126
Kind of perfect.

593
00:52:17,631 --> 00:52:23,005
Because when I saw him, he was always
like this kid on vacation, you know.

594
00:52:23,095 --> 00:52:28,054
Kind of goofy, like he was just excited
not to have to be on his best behaviour.

595
00:52:31,813 --> 00:52:33,011
I got it.

596
00:52:33,565 --> 00:52:35,189
- Thank you.
- Okay.

597
00:52:35,942 --> 00:52:38,398
I'll talk to you.

598
00:52:38,487 --> 00:52:39,649
Okay.

599
00:52:47,246 --> 00:52:49,916
I just want you to know, I am back.
Like, in a big way.

600
00:52:49,999 --> 00:52:54,792
Just 100% committed.
200%, really, committed

601
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:59,501
to this company and from now on,
every second of every day

602
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:01,550
I'm just going to be thinking

603
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:05,931
and just dreaming and just flat-out being

604
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,393
herbal tea.

605
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:18,235
Oh, 100%, 200%...

606
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:21,821
In Boulder. Number of a Silver Saddle Motel.

607
00:53:25,204 --> 00:53:29,996
<i>Oh, my God, this is my favourite.
"Be bold, be bold, everywhere be bold."</i>

608
00:53:30,084 --> 00:53:32,492
Oh, my God, are you kidding me?
I wrote that, man!

609
00:53:32,587 --> 00:53:34,793
- What's mung beans?
- Well, you know, I didn't really write it.

610
00:53:34,881 --> 00:53:38,713
Spenser wrote it. But I filled out
the paperwork that put it on the box.

611
00:53:51,315 --> 00:53:52,809
Hi.

612
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,771
Gray, what are... You're home early.

613
00:53:56,821 --> 00:53:57,984
Yeah, okay, well...

614
00:53:58,072 --> 00:54:02,485
So, you know the other night?
I noticed that this refrigerator...

615
00:54:02,577 --> 00:54:05,863
Do you know everything in here
is a chi blocker?

616
00:54:06,248 --> 00:54:09,166
And that's exactly what I'm studying
is Chinese medicine.

617
00:54:09,251 --> 00:54:11,659
And, you know,
the first thing we're learning is that

618
00:54:11,754 --> 00:54:15,123
you can't, like, emotionally process things

619
00:54:15,216 --> 00:54:17,754
if your chi is congested.

620
00:54:17,844 --> 00:54:21,924
It's like a kind of cerebral constipation.

621
00:54:22,015 --> 00:54:23,509
Sorry.

622
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,008
Anyway, I just... So...

623
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:28,183
Here!

624
00:54:43,371 --> 00:54:44,652
You see?

625
00:54:45,123 --> 00:54:46,617
It's working!

626
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:50,244
Your colour is, like,
coming back in your cheeks and...

627
00:54:50,337 --> 00:54:53,920
Do you see, like, the aura?
It was, like, a dusty... Now it's...

628
00:54:54,008 --> 00:54:56,843
So, tonight, I'm going to make
the most cleansing dinner

629
00:54:56,927 --> 00:54:59,383
and I would love if you would join us.

630
00:55:01,891 --> 00:55:03,931
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

631
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:23,740
Why, thank you, sir.

632
00:55:24,248 --> 00:55:26,787
- Go ahead, Mattie.
- Dinner is served!

633
00:55:27,919 --> 00:55:31,335
Oh, right on, man! Fancy shmancy!

634
00:55:31,423 --> 00:55:34,377
It's beautiful out here.
It's like a little fairy paradise.

635
00:55:34,468 --> 00:55:36,591
- Did you make this in there?
- Yes.

636
00:55:38,055 --> 00:55:39,336
All right!

637
00:55:39,765 --> 00:55:41,805
- She's feeding us lawn.
- Dude, shut up.

638
00:55:41,892 --> 00:55:44,431
- Look at this.
- Little pitchers have big ears.

639
00:55:47,023 --> 00:55:49,941
You know, radishes are a blood detoxifier.

640
00:55:50,944 --> 00:55:52,652
I got your Happy Meal.

641
00:55:55,032 --> 00:55:57,784
The loaf is made
with tempeh and bean paste.

642
00:55:57,868 --> 00:55:58,947
Okay.

643
00:55:59,036 --> 00:56:01,954
Oh, and I added cheese curds.
That wasn't in the recipe.

644
00:56:02,039 --> 00:56:06,452
You are going to be so regular tomorrow,
you're not going to believe it.

645
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:16,965
<i>Namaste.</i>

646
00:56:17,389 --> 00:56:18,587
<i>Namaste.</i>

647
00:56:18,682 --> 00:56:19,797
<i>Namaste.</i>

648
00:56:20,726 --> 00:56:21,889
<i>Namaste.</i>

649
00:56:21,977 --> 00:56:23,175
No.

650
00:56:32,947 --> 00:56:34,608
I steal library books.

651
00:56:36,785 --> 00:56:38,160
On purpose.

652
00:56:38,412 --> 00:56:41,579
I have them from every town
I've ever lived in. I can't control it.

653
00:56:42,416 --> 00:56:44,076
Grady never knew that about me.

654
00:56:49,465 --> 00:56:51,339
- Maureen?
- That has wheatgrass in it.

655
00:56:52,218 --> 00:56:53,962
Also, I can put my whole fist in my mouth.

656
00:56:54,053 --> 00:56:56,046
You don't want to see it,
it's a little Traci Lords,

657
00:56:56,139 --> 00:56:58,713
but I never told him that, either,

658
00:56:59,184 --> 00:57:00,678
in six years.

659
00:57:02,563 --> 00:57:03,761
Also,

660
00:57:05,274 --> 00:57:08,725
I love natural disasters!
I want people to die in them.

661
00:57:08,819 --> 00:57:11,690
I'm genuinely disappointed
when the death toll is low.

662
00:57:11,989 --> 00:57:14,944
And also, I made it with a girl once.

663
00:57:18,788 --> 00:57:21,955
And do you know what else?
You know what Grady never knew about me

664
00:57:22,042 --> 00:57:26,372
is that I think catch and release fishermen
are heartless weenies.

665
00:57:26,463 --> 00:57:29,299
I think putting a fish through agony

666
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:32,551
for nothing more than
your own entertainment is just plain cruel.

667
00:57:32,637 --> 00:57:35,757
I think if you're going to torture
a living thing...

668
00:57:35,848 --> 00:57:39,383
If you're going to make it
look into the eyes of its maker,

669
00:57:39,561 --> 00:57:42,396
face its own puny little place
in the universe,

670
00:57:42,481 --> 00:57:45,565
then, for God's sake,
have the decency to eat it!

671
00:57:55,495 --> 00:57:57,902
This is excellent, Maureen.
I mean, I feel better.

672
00:57:59,415 --> 00:58:00,578
Thanks.

673
00:58:00,667 --> 00:58:01,865
Good.

674
00:58:03,879 --> 00:58:05,254
So,

675
00:58:05,338 --> 00:58:07,912
were you, like, the bitch

676
00:58:08,342 --> 00:58:11,213
or the butch?

677
00:58:21,272 --> 00:58:24,392
You know what? Give me that.
Give me it, you little sniper.

678
00:58:24,484 --> 00:58:27,900
This is not a toy. Okay? This is a weapon.

679
00:58:27,988 --> 00:58:29,447
Weapons are toys.

680
00:58:29,531 --> 00:58:31,026
Weapons are...

681
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:34,278
You need a hobby, kid.
In a big, bad way, and I mean now.

682
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:36,695
You need like a bike or some comic books,

683
00:58:36,789 --> 00:58:39,541
maybe a fishing rod. Definitely a fishing rod.

684
00:58:39,834 --> 00:58:41,791
Your dad was an awesome fisherman.

685
00:58:41,961 --> 00:58:44,120
My dad was a superhero.

686
00:58:50,637 --> 00:58:52,096
He also fished.

687
01:01:35,481 --> 01:01:37,273
That's a lot of dust.

688
01:01:37,942 --> 01:01:39,686
Wait, not too far!

689
01:01:39,778 --> 01:01:41,188
But, Maureen, look!

690
01:01:50,205 --> 01:01:52,329
Oh, this is beautiful!

691
01:02:21,614 --> 01:02:22,812
Smile.

692
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:42,386
Now, if you give a man a fish,

693
01:02:43,054 --> 01:02:44,714
he will have a single meal,

694
01:02:44,806 --> 01:02:47,262
but if you teach a man to fish,

695
01:02:48,602 --> 01:02:50,096
he will eat his whole life.

696
01:02:51,313 --> 01:02:52,641
You know what that is?

697
01:02:53,148 --> 01:02:57,692
Kuan Tzu I just rocked you with.
Ancient Chinese philosopher.

698
01:02:58,362 --> 01:03:03,357
Quote from the Lemon Zinger
Green Tea box, you might remember.

699
01:03:05,662 --> 01:03:06,907
I can tell by your face, no.

700
01:03:06,996 --> 01:03:08,455
You know what? Doesn't matter.

701
01:03:09,624 --> 01:03:10,869
Fly-fishing.

702
01:03:11,918 --> 01:03:14,706
A lot of people seem to feel that

703
01:03:15,672 --> 01:03:19,338
the key piece of equipment is the rod,
but I disagree, sir.

704
01:03:19,802 --> 01:03:21,177
I've always felt

705
01:03:22,346 --> 01:03:25,098
all the magic is in the hat.

706
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:29,264
And this hat is yours.

707
01:03:34,359 --> 01:03:37,230
It belonged to your dad.

708
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:43,827
Very cool.

709
01:04:17,406 --> 01:04:20,407
...which is ironic
because that chick had a pretty big-ass...

710
01:04:21,994 --> 01:04:25,577
Whoa, hold on. I think we might...
Maybe we're on a log.

711
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:29,542
We're not! We're not on a log, kid.
There's something alive here!

712
01:04:30,002 --> 01:04:33,122
Oh, my God, we got a fish! We're getting a...

713
01:04:33,214 --> 01:04:35,124
Dennis! We're getting a...

714
01:04:35,216 --> 01:04:38,383
Look, I'm going to level with you, kid.
I've never caught anything in my life.

715
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:41,008
I've been faking it. One time I lied
and I bought a fish at a store

716
01:04:41,098 --> 01:04:43,007
but this is the first time
I have ever caught a fish

717
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:44,475
and you're going to help me reel it in!

718
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,718
Grab the rod.
Come on, we're going to bring him in!

719
01:04:46,812 --> 01:04:49,849
Oh, my. This is what God feels like
when he catches a fish!

720
01:04:49,941 --> 01:04:52,147
Come on! Come on, you son of a...

721
01:04:52,235 --> 01:04:53,943
Bring him in! Reel him in. Pull!

722
01:04:54,028 --> 01:04:55,191
Pull!

723
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:58,865
Dig it! Dig it! Now bring him in!
Bring him in! Yes!

724
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:00,528
Yes! Yes!

725
01:05:01,244 --> 01:05:03,237
Man versus fish. What...

726
01:05:11,964 --> 01:05:15,713
That's kind of... You know what?
He's a little sleepy. Come on, Mattie.

727
01:05:17,762 --> 01:05:19,256
Let's head over this way.

728
01:05:23,393 --> 01:05:25,682
Look out, it's a heartless fisherman.

729
01:05:26,313 --> 01:05:27,891
Someone call PETA.

730
01:05:29,817 --> 01:05:34,479
You know,
fish have brains the size of pebbles.

731
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:37,108
They don't even remember pain.

732
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,742
You keep telling yourself that.

733
01:05:39,285 --> 01:05:40,530
It's the truth.

734
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:45,615
Okay, fine. Just don't lead with it
on a date. It makes you sound cold.

735
01:05:48,378 --> 01:05:50,336
Hey, who are you dating these days?

736
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,879
Nobody.

737
01:05:53,968 --> 01:05:57,882
What about that girl from that place
who liked you? You know, with the hair.

738
01:05:58,056 --> 01:05:59,550
- Persephone?
- Yeah.

739
01:05:59,682 --> 01:06:02,968
- You should ask her out.
- Yeah, I don't know.

740
01:06:03,228 --> 01:06:06,395
I guess I'm not exactly available.

741
01:06:06,481 --> 01:06:08,391
What do you mean?
You just said you're not dating.

742
01:06:09,693 --> 01:06:13,442
- Oh, you're dating someone secret.
- No.

743
01:06:13,531 --> 01:06:15,191
Are you having an affair
with a married woman?

744
01:06:15,282 --> 01:06:16,741
No! God!

745
01:06:16,826 --> 01:06:19,399
- Dennis, fess up. Do I know her?
- No.

746
01:06:19,495 --> 01:06:22,117
- I'm the last one to know everything.
- No! Good God, no.

747
01:06:22,207 --> 01:06:25,907
I'm not having an affair
with a married woman. That's ridiculous.

748
01:06:26,503 --> 01:06:28,828
I don't know. What else could it be?

749
01:06:28,922 --> 01:06:31,294
- You really want to know?
- Badly.

750
01:06:33,677 --> 01:06:35,053
All right.

751
01:06:36,096 --> 01:06:37,425
I'll tell you.

752
01:06:40,143 --> 01:06:43,263
For the past six years,

753
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:46,056
I've been telling myself the same thing.

754
01:06:48,443 --> 01:06:51,444
<i>"It's okay. He's a better man."</i>

755
01:06:53,323 --> 01:06:54,568
And it turns out

756
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,110
that's just bullshit.

757
01:06:58,245 --> 01:07:00,487
Look at what he did to you, Gray.

758
01:07:03,418 --> 01:07:08,329
He had, hands-down,
the best girl in the world, and he goes...

759
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,129
If I had you,

760
01:07:12,302 --> 01:07:14,840
if you were mine, there is no way...

761
01:07:16,473 --> 01:07:18,300
There is no way.

762
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:34,320
Scratch that.

763
01:07:34,409 --> 01:07:37,280
I'm having an affair with a married woman.

764
01:07:37,746 --> 01:07:39,905
I do love you, Dennis.

765
01:07:41,584 --> 01:07:42,959
That's great.

766
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:28,878
Hey, Mattie.

767
01:08:32,013 --> 01:08:34,006
- Hey.
- What?

768
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:41,684
Mattie.

769
01:08:41,773 --> 01:08:43,850
Put your foot up. There you go.

770
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:49,359
There we go.

771
01:08:50,199 --> 01:08:52,026
We'll get you all fixed up.

772
01:09:18,813 --> 01:09:22,229
And today's Little Mary Sunshine Award
goes to...

773
01:09:57,438 --> 01:09:58,767
I'm starving.

774
01:10:04,237 --> 01:10:07,357
You get extremely cool stuff
when you get married.

775
01:10:07,449 --> 01:10:08,860
No wonder people do it.

776
01:10:09,743 --> 01:10:11,119
Were you ever close?

777
01:10:11,578 --> 01:10:12,907
To getting married?

778
01:10:13,747 --> 01:10:14,827
No.

779
01:10:15,708 --> 01:10:17,286
Why not, do you think?

780
01:10:19,086 --> 01:10:24,164
I don't know. I guess it just
always made more sense to walk away.

781
01:10:27,554 --> 01:10:28,965
Aren't you lonely?

782
01:10:32,684 --> 01:10:35,057
Right now, no.

783
01:10:35,896 --> 01:10:37,141
No, just...

784
01:10:38,315 --> 01:10:39,561
In general.

785
01:10:40,151 --> 01:10:42,060
Who do you tell your stories to?

786
01:10:43,529 --> 01:10:45,321
I guess I keep them to myself.

787
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:48,445
That's a tragedy.

788
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:52,450
Yeah.

789
01:10:56,168 --> 01:10:57,828
You want to hear a story?

790
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,200
I got a good one.

791
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:03,501
Guy goes to a funeral...

792
01:11:10,517 --> 01:11:11,680
Sorry.

793
01:11:17,733 --> 01:11:21,945
Look at you, rocking the Foreman
at 3:00 in the morning. Right on, sir.

794
01:11:25,658 --> 01:11:27,485
You going to eat both of those, or...

795
01:11:28,995 --> 01:11:30,110
No.

796
01:11:31,706 --> 01:11:33,829
- Dig in.
- Thanks, man.

797
01:11:38,213 --> 01:11:41,499
They say you're not supposed to eat
after 7:00, but,

798
01:11:41,592 --> 01:11:43,501
what, am I trying to win a beauty contest?

799
01:11:45,346 --> 01:11:46,674
Thanks, Fritz!

800
01:11:48,725 --> 01:11:50,100
You bet, buddy.

801
01:11:59,570 --> 01:12:02,571
They have to take the DNA sample
at the hospital.

802
01:12:03,157 --> 01:12:06,324
The only way I could get him to go
was by promising you'd come.

803
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:08,191
Well, I'm glad I could...

804
01:12:08,287 --> 01:12:10,529
Hospitals scare the you-know-what
out of him.

805
01:12:10,623 --> 01:12:13,957
He was a preemie. He was, like,
three and a half weeks early,

806
01:12:14,044 --> 01:12:17,210
and he wasn't ready
to leave my womb at that point.

807
01:12:17,297 --> 01:12:21,081
So I think, like, on some deep psychic level,

808
01:12:21,301 --> 01:12:26,094
he must associate hospitals with fear
and separation.

809
01:12:26,182 --> 01:12:30,725
<i>Like, "Oh, my God! I'm leaving my mother!</i>

810
01:12:30,812 --> 01:12:33,219
<i>"What if I never see her again?</i>

811
01:12:33,314 --> 01:12:36,102
<i>"Am I all alone in this world?"</i>

812
01:12:36,192 --> 01:12:37,936
That's a heavy load.

813
01:12:41,239 --> 01:12:45,024
<i>You ever hear the expression
"The power of suggestion," Maureen?</i>

814
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:46,198
'Cause...

815
01:12:47,371 --> 01:12:49,578
No, is that, like, a workshop?

816
01:12:59,676 --> 01:13:01,254
Oh, yeah.

817
01:13:02,179 --> 01:13:03,922
So it's a little filthy.

818
01:13:04,014 --> 01:13:05,923
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's all right.

819
01:13:06,016 --> 01:13:09,101
Can I get you something to drink?
We got beer,

820
01:13:09,186 --> 01:13:11,760
we got some tap water.

821
01:13:11,856 --> 01:13:14,311
- Do you have wine?
- Yes, we have wine.

822
01:13:15,443 --> 01:13:19,441
Glasses are over there. Let me see
if we can find something at least drinkable.

823
01:13:23,952 --> 01:13:25,197
All right.

824
01:13:25,329 --> 01:13:26,953
Here we go.

825
01:13:27,164 --> 01:13:32,206
I have no idea if this is any good.
It was given to me by a client

826
01:13:32,294 --> 01:13:34,287
I took up to Snake River.

827
01:13:35,631 --> 01:13:36,912
What is it?

828
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:42,297
Persephone.

829
01:14:12,963 --> 01:14:16,712
Sam, I don't know how to thank you.
I really don't.

830
01:14:16,926 --> 01:14:19,334
You know what? It's totally cool.

831
01:14:19,470 --> 01:14:23,515
No, it really could've been a nightmare
with that giant Q-Tip thing.

832
01:14:23,683 --> 01:14:25,308
Here, honey.

833
01:14:25,393 --> 01:14:27,185
You know what?
This kid did not need my help.

834
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:29,940
The Force is strong with this one.
I was just there.

835
01:14:30,023 --> 01:14:33,938
You know, normally I would offer
to make you something to eat, but...

836
01:14:34,027 --> 01:14:35,901
I mean, I have trail mix.

837
01:14:35,988 --> 01:14:38,775
I've already had dinner with you once
and, no offence,

838
01:14:38,866 --> 01:14:41,784
but I've reached my annual quota of turf.

839
01:14:41,869 --> 01:14:43,862
Oh, hey, I know!

840
01:14:44,372 --> 01:14:46,163
How about a massage?

841
01:14:50,378 --> 01:14:52,502
Did you take a course?

842
01:14:52,589 --> 01:14:55,294
Yeah, this is, like, a percussion-based.

843
01:14:55,384 --> 01:14:58,551
All you got to do is watch
the drummers on the beach, really.

844
01:14:58,637 --> 01:15:02,053
Any lower and you might hit a gas pocket.

845
01:15:02,141 --> 01:15:05,261
Little guy doesn't want to give it up.

846
01:15:05,353 --> 01:15:07,227
Maybe he should stay.

847
01:15:07,313 --> 01:15:10,065
- Sam, you're not breathing.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot.

848
01:15:11,735 --> 01:15:15,353
- Your calves are extraordinary.
- Well, you... Thanks.

849
01:15:15,447 --> 01:15:16,941
Did you play football?

850
01:15:17,032 --> 01:15:19,819
I watched a lot of football.

851
01:15:24,665 --> 01:15:25,828
Right on.

852
01:15:28,086 --> 01:15:29,913
Do you feel that chakra energy?

853
01:15:31,089 --> 01:15:33,082
Is that what it is? Yes.

854
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:36,172
It's very

855
01:15:36,428 --> 01:15:37,922
chakr-y.

856
01:15:39,264 --> 01:15:40,427
Okay.

857
01:15:40,516 --> 01:15:42,390
Well, I can't thank you enough. That was...

858
01:15:42,476 --> 01:15:44,433
- Sam, we're not done.
- No?

859
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,312
- Turn over.
- What?

860
01:15:48,441 --> 01:15:49,935
Oh, no.

861
01:17:11,363 --> 01:17:14,982
Is there a name for this method?

862
01:17:15,076 --> 01:17:16,618
Just be open.

863
01:17:21,666 --> 01:17:24,786
You can really start to feel the aura change.

864
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:27,828
I feel a light magenta.

865
01:17:46,067 --> 01:17:47,692
Oh, my God.

866
01:17:49,029 --> 01:17:50,358
Oh, God.

867
01:17:53,826 --> 01:17:55,486
What am I thinking?

868
01:17:55,995 --> 01:17:59,411
- It's totally okay, you know?
- No, it's not.

869
01:17:59,707 --> 01:18:03,705
You're being too hard on yourself, man.
It's not a thing. Don't worry about it.

870
01:18:05,505 --> 01:18:07,249
I'm a terrible mother.

871
01:18:07,841 --> 01:18:11,376
Oh, come on, that's just crap.
You're an excellent mother.

872
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:14,222
That kid, I've seen you with him.
He loves you, you know?

873
01:18:14,306 --> 01:18:15,421
Sam,

874
01:18:17,351 --> 01:18:18,976
I can't do this.

875
01:18:20,521 --> 01:18:22,064
It's too hard.

876
01:18:22,941 --> 01:18:24,269
Yes, you can.

877
01:18:27,612 --> 01:18:28,893
You can do it.

878
01:18:33,744 --> 01:18:35,072
You're a gem.

879
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:41,326
Come here. Come here.

880
01:18:55,434 --> 01:18:56,928
What?

881
01:19:00,648 --> 01:19:04,266
My girlfriends and I used to
have this rule with each other.

882
01:19:05,653 --> 01:19:09,236
<i>"No sleeping with a guy
until you knew his mother's maiden name."</i>

883
01:19:10,617 --> 01:19:11,780
What?

884
01:19:12,869 --> 01:19:15,705
We figured it would keep us out of beds of

885
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:18,283
men we barely knew.

886
01:19:21,086 --> 01:19:22,285
Gideon.

887
01:19:22,546 --> 01:19:23,709
Gideon.

888
01:19:24,006 --> 01:19:25,999
Anything else you want to know?

889
01:19:28,136 --> 01:19:29,464
What's your favourite colour?

890
01:19:31,639 --> 01:19:32,754
Gray.

891
01:19:36,478 --> 01:19:38,554
You are not who I thought you were.

892
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:41,649
Yeah, well,

893
01:19:43,777 --> 01:19:45,153
neither are you.

894
01:21:34,063 --> 01:21:35,854
Morning, Dennis.

895
01:21:37,233 --> 01:21:38,431
What...

896
01:21:39,736 --> 01:21:42,025
What you doing there, sir?

897
01:21:44,074 --> 01:21:47,573
All right, seriously, handyman,
whatever this is,

898
01:21:47,953 --> 01:21:50,242
just not good for you,

899
01:21:50,789 --> 01:21:53,280
really not good for our front door.

900
01:21:58,381 --> 01:22:00,457
Give me the planer, Dennis.

901
01:22:05,096 --> 01:22:07,172
Give me the planer, Dennis.

902
01:22:09,851 --> 01:22:11,310
Give me the planer, Dennis.

903
01:22:11,395 --> 01:22:13,720
Give me the planer, Dennis!

904
01:22:13,814 --> 01:22:15,522
- Give me it.
- Get off me.

905
01:22:15,608 --> 01:22:17,066
Let it go!

906
01:23:11,084 --> 01:23:12,247
Yeah.

907
01:23:40,616 --> 01:23:42,075
Wow! What is this?

908
01:23:42,785 --> 01:23:45,110
I need to find a picture
for the garden dedication.

909
01:23:45,204 --> 01:23:48,371
I can't find one
where you can really see his face.

910
01:23:53,338 --> 01:23:55,959
I'm a big boy, you know?

911
01:23:57,175 --> 01:23:59,215
You could've just told me.

912
01:23:59,386 --> 01:24:00,880
Told you what?

913
01:24:00,971 --> 01:24:03,806
That you were in love with someone else.

914
01:24:06,727 --> 01:24:07,972
I'm not.

915
01:24:08,396 --> 01:24:10,887
I saw you guys coming in last night.

916
01:24:14,444 --> 01:24:16,353
Dennis. God.

917
01:24:17,072 --> 01:24:18,447
That's nothing.

918
01:24:18,532 --> 01:24:21,901
It's less than nothing.

919
01:24:25,205 --> 01:24:26,320
Okay.

920
01:24:26,832 --> 01:24:30,664
I have stuff in storage. I'll find you a picture.

921
01:24:31,838 --> 01:24:32,917
Yeah.

922
01:26:10,485 --> 01:26:11,861
Nice dress.

923
01:26:16,909 --> 01:26:18,902
Oh, this is embarrassing.

924
01:26:21,038 --> 01:26:23,364
I never got a chance to wear it.

925
01:26:24,792 --> 01:26:26,453
It's a girl thing.

926
01:26:32,175 --> 01:26:34,049
- What are you doing?
- Heading out.

927
01:26:34,136 --> 01:26:36,709
Just wanted to check in, say goodbye.

928
01:26:39,141 --> 01:26:40,683
You're leaving?

929
01:26:41,310 --> 01:26:43,517
- Why? What happened?
- Nothing.

930
01:26:45,481 --> 01:26:47,225
Less than nothing,

931
01:26:47,984 --> 01:26:49,147
right?

932
01:26:52,656 --> 01:26:56,025
Yeah, that's the thing with small houses,
everybody hears everything.

933
01:26:58,162 --> 01:27:01,578
You got to get yourself a big one, like mine.

934
01:27:02,249 --> 01:27:05,619
On the beach, in Malibu, waves crashing.

935
01:27:06,629 --> 01:27:08,586
Nobody can hear a thing.

936
01:27:09,215 --> 01:27:10,875
I didn't mean it.

937
01:27:12,385 --> 01:27:13,796
That's okay.

938
01:27:15,972 --> 01:27:18,594
Really. I got to get home anyway.

939
01:27:19,935 --> 01:27:21,560
Back to reality.

940
01:27:23,314 --> 01:27:24,393
So...

941
01:27:27,944 --> 01:27:29,901
- I'll see you.
- Fritz, wait.

942
01:27:33,491 --> 01:27:37,192
- I only said that because...
- Because you were embarrassed.

943
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:39,455
That's okay.

944
01:27:39,957 --> 01:27:42,163
Me and you doesn't look good.

945
01:27:43,627 --> 01:27:45,620
Not your style, right?

946
01:27:50,218 --> 01:27:51,380
I'll see you.

947
01:27:51,469 --> 01:27:53,047
- Wait.
- For what?

948
01:27:54,597 --> 01:27:58,097
You going to get out of that wedding dress?
That's gonna take a while.

949
01:28:04,108 --> 01:28:05,519
I got to go.

950
01:28:25,297 --> 01:28:27,669
Kind of quiet in here, isn't it?

951
01:28:28,217 --> 01:28:31,669
<i>"Yeah, it's real quiet, Sam.
Good talking to you, dude."</i>

952
01:29:19,647 --> 01:29:20,892
Ladies,

953
01:29:21,566 --> 01:29:22,977
not his kid.

954
01:29:24,611 --> 01:29:25,690
What?

955
01:29:25,862 --> 01:29:29,196
There's absolutely no chance
that Mr. Douglas fathered that child.

956
01:29:36,958 --> 01:29:38,500
Thank you, Eve.

957
01:30:14,915 --> 01:30:16,374
This is a mistake.

958
01:30:16,584 --> 01:30:19,039
You know? It has to be, because...

959
01:30:19,295 --> 01:30:24,087
It just has to be and they probably just
took the wrong sample or...

960
01:30:24,592 --> 01:30:29,254
Or maybe I have the same initials, M.M.,
as someone else.

961
01:30:29,848 --> 01:30:32,006
Marlene Morris, or...

962
01:30:32,476 --> 01:30:35,512
Yeah, but they're usually
kind of careful with this stuff.

963
01:30:35,604 --> 01:30:39,684
No. I'm telling you, doctors make mistakes.

964
01:30:39,942 --> 01:30:42,184
I saw an entire documentary.

965
01:30:42,278 --> 01:30:44,816
They amputate the wrong leg all the time,

966
01:30:44,906 --> 01:30:47,278
you have this one dying over here.

967
01:30:47,367 --> 01:30:50,783
You know, it's, like, a zoo at the hospital.

968
01:30:51,079 --> 01:30:53,570
Yeah, I don't know if that's the case.

969
01:30:53,665 --> 01:30:56,370
- Hey, you know what? Just...
- I'm just saying.

970
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:58,499
Okay, well, I don't know
what you guys are saying,

971
01:30:58,587 --> 01:31:01,257
because all I know is, we

972
01:31:02,591 --> 01:31:06,376
were sexual
and then nine months later I had a kid.

973
01:31:06,763 --> 01:31:08,257
Eight months.

974
01:31:08,806 --> 01:31:12,389
Because Mattie was born
three and a half weeks premature.

975
01:31:12,644 --> 01:31:14,269
Yeah, I know. I mean...

976
01:31:15,272 --> 01:31:18,557
But when I got the ultrasound,
the doctor told me

977
01:31:18,901 --> 01:31:22,186
the exact day
of when we probably conceived.

978
01:31:22,780 --> 01:31:26,694
This would be one of those doctors
that amputates the wrong leg.

979
01:31:26,784 --> 01:31:28,278
Jesus, Dennis, just...

980
01:31:35,794 --> 01:31:37,169
Oh, my God.

981
01:31:39,089 --> 01:31:41,296
You know who the real guy is?

982
01:31:43,510 --> 01:31:45,550
Yeah, his name was Rafael.

983
01:31:46,889 --> 01:31:48,633
He was really nice.

984
01:31:49,350 --> 01:31:52,517
He was, like, Italian or French.

985
01:31:57,317 --> 01:31:59,025
What do you think you're going to do?

986
01:32:01,655 --> 01:32:03,149
I'm not sure.

987
01:32:05,159 --> 01:32:09,572
I guess I'll quit school and go back to work.

988
01:32:10,915 --> 01:32:13,038
Find a daycare for Mattie,

989
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:18,755
but all the places I can afford
are so kind of depressing.

990
01:32:20,217 --> 01:32:21,877
But it'll be all right.

991
01:32:21,968 --> 01:32:25,919
It will, you know.
It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay.

992
01:32:27,474 --> 01:32:28,933
It always is.

993
01:32:31,312 --> 01:32:34,147
God, I shouldn't have ripped up
that cheque.

994
01:32:34,315 --> 01:32:35,478
Stupid.

995
01:32:36,985 --> 01:32:39,310
Sam, how do I open the big one?

996
01:32:40,530 --> 01:32:41,989
Just don't...

997
01:32:42,532 --> 01:32:44,655
I'm going to... Come on, kid.

998
01:32:45,243 --> 01:32:46,702
It's a knife!

999
01:32:50,541 --> 01:32:52,866
All right, Mattie. Come on, man.

1000
01:33:24,661 --> 01:33:27,532
I'm really, really so sorry about all this.

1001
01:33:29,124 --> 01:33:32,291
You could've just loved him
and missed him,

1002
01:33:33,379 --> 01:33:34,624
and never known.

1003
01:33:34,713 --> 01:33:35,793
Him.

1004
01:33:37,550 --> 01:33:39,128
Never known him.

1005
01:33:44,516 --> 01:33:48,430
You know,
I just remembered something recently.

1006
01:33:52,608 --> 01:33:56,024
About a year ago,
he and I spent a day on the river.

1007
01:33:56,195 --> 01:33:59,646
<i>He fished and I read.
It was one of those perfect days.</i>

1008
01:34:00,908 --> 01:34:04,906
<i>We were on our way home
and he said he had something to tell me.</i>

1009
01:34:05,121 --> 01:34:08,573
<i>I said, "Is it going to make me happier,
or less happy?"</i>

1010
01:34:09,042 --> 01:34:10,786
<i>He said, "Less happy."</i>

1011
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:12,700
<i>I said...</i>

1012
01:34:14,214 --> 01:34:15,958
<i>"Then don't tell me."</i>

1013
01:34:26,477 --> 01:34:28,850
Ellen. Hi.

1014
01:34:30,315 --> 01:34:32,557
I'd like to talk about the boy.

1015
01:34:32,651 --> 01:34:35,605
The one that is definitely not my son's child.

1016
01:34:36,321 --> 01:34:39,773
Well, the one he decided to support
without a DNA test.

1017
01:34:45,164 --> 01:34:47,371
Grady didn't need that money.

1018
01:34:47,792 --> 01:34:52,122
And he knew this kid's life
would be so much better with a little help.

1019
01:34:53,882 --> 01:34:55,625
What are you saying?

1020
01:34:56,802 --> 01:35:01,345
I'm saying if you don't give this child
what Grady wanted him to have

1021
01:35:02,308 --> 01:35:03,719
then I will.

1022
01:35:04,685 --> 01:35:06,643
But you don't have money.

1023
01:35:06,729 --> 01:35:07,844
No.

1024
01:35:11,818 --> 01:35:13,526
But I do have this.

1025
01:35:18,325 --> 01:35:20,650
I don't want to sell it, Ellen.

1026
01:35:21,453 --> 01:35:24,075
I would so rather give it back to you.

1027
01:35:25,166 --> 01:35:29,460
But all I know is that for whatever reason,
Grady wanted this boy to be okay.

1028
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:04,867
Look, the papaya lady!

1029
01:36:07,586 --> 01:36:10,837
Hey. You knew him, too?

1030
01:36:12,383 --> 01:36:13,877
He was my son.

1031
01:36:14,636 --> 01:36:16,593
I should've told you that.

1032
01:36:20,809 --> 01:36:22,303
God, that's...

1033
01:36:22,644 --> 01:36:23,973
I'm sorry.

1034
01:36:26,648 --> 01:36:28,855
How did you know who we were?

1035
01:36:29,443 --> 01:36:30,985
It was the hat.

1036
01:36:32,196 --> 01:36:34,485
Grady tied those flies himself.

1037
01:36:36,117 --> 01:36:37,362
He did?

1038
01:36:41,289 --> 01:36:43,578
This is for you.

1039
01:36:46,044 --> 01:36:47,669
Am I in trouble?

1040
01:36:48,338 --> 01:36:49,453
No.

1041
01:36:50,674 --> 01:36:53,000
I figure you're going to pout all day
until I say this,

1042
01:36:53,094 --> 01:36:55,051
so I'm just going to put it out there.

1043
01:36:55,137 --> 01:36:56,929
You give good garden.

1044
01:36:57,598 --> 01:36:59,093
Thanks, buddy.

1045
01:37:00,226 --> 01:37:02,552
Hey, there's something I got to tell you.

1046
01:37:02,646 --> 01:37:04,306
Yeah, what's that?

1047
01:37:04,606 --> 01:37:06,397
I found a new place.

1048
01:37:08,026 --> 01:37:09,734
New place for what?

1049
01:37:10,779 --> 01:37:11,977
Really?

1050
01:37:13,908 --> 01:37:16,909
For me to live in.

1051
01:37:19,914 --> 01:37:21,741
What? What? Wait! What?

1052
01:37:23,376 --> 01:37:25,333
- You're moving out?
- Yes.

1053
01:37:25,754 --> 01:37:27,746
- Oh, my God, dude.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

1054
01:37:27,839 --> 01:37:30,295
- It was just a fight, sir.
- Look, it's not about you.

1055
01:37:30,384 --> 01:37:32,957
It's just that it feels like time, man.

1056
01:37:33,053 --> 01:37:34,548
It's not time.

1057
01:37:34,930 --> 01:37:38,050
It was a small fight, sir. A tiny fight.
Like, we'll get over it, sir.

1058
01:37:38,142 --> 01:37:40,135
I'm not ready to live alone, Dennis.

1059
01:37:40,228 --> 01:37:41,805
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1060
01:37:41,896 --> 01:37:46,024
It's a great house
and I'm sure if you want to stay there,

1061
01:37:46,109 --> 01:37:48,268
you're not gonna have any trouble
finding another roommate.

1062
01:37:59,999 --> 01:38:01,114
Ellen.

1063
01:38:02,502 --> 01:38:04,993
It was great what you did for them.

1064
01:38:06,965 --> 01:38:08,044
Here.

1065
01:38:08,383 --> 01:38:11,004
Oh, no. You keep it.

1066
01:38:12,304 --> 01:38:17,050
Just promise me that the next person
who gets it, you'll tell them about him,

1067
01:38:17,810 --> 01:38:19,933
everything you can remember.

1068
01:38:21,605 --> 01:38:22,934
I promise.

1069
01:38:23,983 --> 01:38:27,269
I didn't need the money. I never wanted it.

1070
01:38:27,779 --> 01:38:29,024
Or the ring.

1071
01:38:32,242 --> 01:38:34,282
I just wanted my boy back.

1072
01:38:43,963 --> 01:38:46,536
I didn't know everything about Grady.

1073
01:38:47,842 --> 01:38:50,131
Here's some of what I did know.

1074
01:38:50,804 --> 01:38:53,509
<i>I told them all the great things
I know about you,</i>

1075
01:38:53,598 --> 01:38:56,172
<i>and there were a lot. I was up there a while.</i>

1076
01:38:56,268 --> 01:38:57,892
He loved coffee.

1077
01:38:57,978 --> 01:39:00,516
<i>I didn't tell them everything, though.</i>

1078
01:39:00,606 --> 01:39:03,227
<i>I left out the complicated stuff,</i>

1079
01:39:03,526 --> 01:39:07,310
<i>like how it took losing you forever
for me to truly find you.</i>

1080
01:39:07,822 --> 01:39:11,357
<i>And how finding you
turned me into someone else entirely.</i>

1081
01:39:11,868 --> 01:39:14,074
<i>That's not what they came for.</i>

1082
01:39:14,204 --> 01:39:16,031
<i>People want to hear you were great.</i>

1083
01:39:16,122 --> 01:39:19,823
<i>Not that you were great,
but also, sometimes, not so great.</i>

1084
01:39:20,711 --> 01:39:22,953
<i>They want to know I miss you.</i>

1085
01:39:23,255 --> 01:39:25,877
<i>Not that while I've been missing you,</i>

1086
01:39:25,966 --> 01:39:28,173
<i>I've fallen for someone else.</i>

1087
01:39:29,053 --> 01:39:30,713
<i>It's weird, though.</i>

1088
01:39:30,805 --> 01:39:34,305
<i>I feel like the only one
who would understand it is you.</i>

1089
01:39:34,392 --> 01:39:35,555
<i>In a way, that makes sense.</i>

1090
01:39:35,643 --> 01:39:38,135
<i>He was the one person
you were yourself around.</i>

1091
01:39:38,230 --> 01:39:41,017
<i>Of course he'd be that same person for me.</i>

1092
01:39:41,191 --> 01:39:44,358
<i>Anyway, I left all that out
and I kept it simple.</i>

1093
01:39:44,903 --> 01:39:48,439
<i>I told them I loved you and that's the truth.</i>

1094
01:40:02,589 --> 01:40:05,590
- Do I get my own bedroom?
- Yeah.

1095
01:40:05,676 --> 01:40:09,425
- Can I use the hockey table?
- Absolutely not.

1096
01:40:12,975 --> 01:40:14,600
Wait, which one are we taking?

1097
01:40:14,686 --> 01:40:17,307
Take the one upstairs on the left, Mo.

1098
01:40:21,651 --> 01:40:22,766
Whoa.

1099
01:40:24,613 --> 01:40:25,988
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1100
01:40:27,783 --> 01:40:31,947
Well, I just figured they should stick around
at least until winter

1101
01:40:32,038 --> 01:40:33,746
because the kid has never seen snow.

1102
01:40:33,831 --> 01:40:36,666
- What kind of craziness is that?
- Totally.

1103
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:41,544
That's a bold move, Samuel.

1104
01:40:41,631 --> 01:40:43,790
Well, as Helen Keller once said,

1105
01:40:43,884 --> 01:40:47,716
<i>"Life is either a daring adventure
or nothing."</i>

1106
01:40:48,096 --> 01:40:49,425
Which tea?

1107
01:40:50,432 --> 01:40:53,683
Come on, sir.
I've been known to pick up a book.

1108
01:40:53,769 --> 01:40:55,596
- Which tea?
- Tummy Mint.

1109
01:40:55,688 --> 01:40:58,475
Sam, are you bringing the bags?

1110
01:40:59,108 --> 01:41:00,353
- I'm...
- You just...

1111
01:41:00,443 --> 01:41:01,937
- Yeah, I'm on it.
- All right.

1112
01:41:10,204 --> 01:41:14,284
Oh, now, what the hell is this?
You're leaving, too? Come on, man.

1113
01:41:14,416 --> 01:41:16,908
You have a very full house here, Sam.

1114
01:41:17,003 --> 01:41:19,079
You don't need me. You'll be fine.

1115
01:41:19,172 --> 01:41:21,295
Well, can I at least come visit you
at your new place,

1116
01:41:21,382 --> 01:41:24,798
maybe paint your walls
an inappropriate shade of blue?

1117
01:41:25,011 --> 01:41:26,636
Yes. Absolutely.

1118
01:41:27,138 --> 01:41:30,259
I'm just going to go on a quick trip
and then...

1119
01:41:30,475 --> 01:41:32,100
Where you going?

1120
01:41:33,479 --> 01:41:34,677
Wait a second.

1121
01:41:34,772 --> 01:41:35,934
No!

1122
01:41:42,405 --> 01:41:43,484
No!

1123
01:41:44,824 --> 01:41:46,616
Oh, you little tramp!

1124
01:41:57,630 --> 01:42:00,037
- You're really going.
- I really am.

1125
01:42:14,523 --> 01:42:17,061
- I'll see you soon.
- Yeah. It's okay.

1126
01:43:58,510 --> 01:43:59,672
Hello?

1127
01:44:05,684 --> 01:44:06,847
Hello?

1128
01:44:57,865 --> 01:45:00,819
Come here. Come here.

1129
01:45:02,245 --> 01:45:04,238
You ready? Okay, come on!

1130
01:45:46,209 --> 01:45:48,083
I think I should have called.

1131
01:45:48,169 --> 01:45:51,171
You're probably busy
or on your way out, or...

1132
01:45:51,256 --> 01:45:54,590
God, you could be seeing someone by now.
I hadn't thought of that.

1133
01:45:54,676 --> 01:45:58,211
Someone you met in a normal,
you know, uncomplicated...

1134
01:46:11,653 --> 01:46:13,527
What took you so long?
