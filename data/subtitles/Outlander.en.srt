1
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
It's time,
Freya.

2
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,240
I told you before, Father

3
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
the answer is no!

4
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,080
Wulfric will be a good man!

5
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,840
With you by his side
maybe a good king!

6
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,560
He'll be just like his father
a tyrant and a butcher.

7
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,200
I won't marry him!

8
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,000
Then you better choose someone else.

9
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,200
Because when he's king
it'll be too late to say no.

10
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,640
Then don't make him king!

11
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,520
Let me look at that.

12
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,280
It's fine.

13
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,840
Let me see it!

14
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,040
I'm not getting any younger, Freya.

15
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,800
I just want to make sure that
you're well looked after

16
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,520
when I'm gone.

17
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,960
I know, Father. I know.

18
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,280
And

19
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,360
if any one can make
Wulfric keep the peace,

20
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,000
by the gods, it's you.

21
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:03,200
I rule Herot and Freya rules me.

22
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,760
I don't think so.

23
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,480
And no queen of mine
will fight like a man.

24
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,000
I will take care of you.

25
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,280
She's like her mother.

26
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,480
You'd do well to tread
more softly with her.

27
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,120
There's nothing soft about her.

28
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,360
Gunnar's village was sacked.

29
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,040
What happened?

30
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,400
I don't know.

31
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,240
There were no bodies, nothing.

32
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,560
Slavers?

33
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,440
Too much blood.

34
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,960
What about Gunnar?

35
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,080
He's still trading with the Rus.

36
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,920
He'll be back before the snow.

37
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,000
He'll think it was us.

38
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,840
It should've been.

39
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,400
Was it?

40
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,520
No.

41
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,800
We caught a man
nearby in the woods.

42
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,320
One of ours?

43
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,520
Well, what tribe was he? Frankish, Rus?

44
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,480
I don't know. But I'll find out.

45
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,200
Well, do it quickly.

46
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,240
It's war if you don't.

47
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,200
I'll take those.

48
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,960
Bring him

49
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,320
So who are you, Outlander?

50
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,920
I'd answer him, friend.

51
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,200
Your name!

52
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,960
My name is Kainan.

53
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,680
Kainan? What kind of name is that?

54
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,240
Where are you from?

55
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,440
An Island to the north.

56
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,080
Why did you attack Gunnar's village?

57
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,320
I didn't attack anyone.

58
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,520
Then why were you there?

59
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,520
I was hunting.

60
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,400
Hunting?

61
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,520
Hunting what?

62
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,920
That.

63
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,640
A dragon

64
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
Tell me! Why where you there?

65
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,480
Where are your men?

66
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,480
Told you.

67
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,960
Don't lie to me.

68
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,080
Stick with the dragons. I like that one.

69
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,040
All right.

70
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,600
I'll tell you.

71
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,400
I was hunting... dragons.

72
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,960
Not yet

73
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,800
The prisoner's hurt.

74
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,320
So are you, by the looks of it.

75
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,560
And he needs looking after

76
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,320
I've got work to do.
You clean up your own mess.

77
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,560
To hell with it then.

78
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,640
He dies, it's on your head.

79
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,280
Bjorn!

80
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,280
He needs looking after

81
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,720
Let me pass.

82
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
That's enough! Get out!

83
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,280
What did he tell you?

84
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,800
Nothing.

85
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,920
Some lies about a dragon.

86
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,520
But he's hiding something.

87
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,600
Keep at him.

88
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,160
I have to send riders to find Gunnar.

89
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,600
He has to know that it wasn't us.

90
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,160
He'll never believe us.
Not when he sees his village.

91
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,880
We should kill him while
we still have the chance.

92
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,960
Like your father would have done.

93
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,280
And he would have been right.

94
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,480
My father's dead because of Gunnar.

95
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,120
Your father's dead
because he was a fool!

96
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,840
You want to kill Gunnar.

97
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,840
I can understand that.

98
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,280
And you want to rule from here.

99
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,320
I can understand that, too.

100
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,040
But it's not your sword that
will make you king, nor Shield Hall.

101
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,960
It's how you rule your own
head and heart.

102
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,160
Until you understand that
then you'll never wear this.

103
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,760
Water.

104
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,960
Please.

105
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,240
Thank you.

106
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,320
Did you do what they're saying?

107
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,800
Did you attack Gunnar's village?

108
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,000
No.

109
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,680
Bjorn!

110
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,040
It's sharp.

111
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,840
It's never sharp enough.

112
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:23,800
If Gunnar comes tonight...

113
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,000
If Gunnar comes tonight he'll stick
that blade right up your arse.

114
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,880
...then you'll wish it wasn't so sharp.

115
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,600
You smell that?

116
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,080
Arn?

117
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,520
The sentries are gone!

118
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,120
It's Gunnar! Get to the walls!

119
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,160
Where are they?!

120
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,960
Is it raiders?

121
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,680
Give me my blade, woman!

122
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,720
They're inside the walls.

123
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,160
Take your men, fan out!

124
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,800
The rest with me!

125
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,080
Gunnar!

126
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,280
Moorwen!

127
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,680
He's getting away!

128
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,000
Get him out of here!

129
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,200
Where is Gunnar?

130
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,520
I don't know!

131
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,840
What could have done this?

132
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,520
Right, get up.
It was the demon, Mimir.

133
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,520
Come to drag us down to Jotunheim

134
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,320
and freeze us dead.

135
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,120
Enough of your forest spirits, Unferth.

136
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,040
It was Frankish raiders. Sure enough!

137
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,560
They climbed over the walls.

138
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,960
Then what, Boromir?

139
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,000
We all saw Bjorn's body.

140
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,480
He was clawed to death.

141
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,320
It was an animal.
No!

142
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,080
This is the work of Lucifer!

143
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,640
Visited upon us because you
buried King Halga like a pagan...

144
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,800
and not like a Christian!

145
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,960
My father was a Viking.

146
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,200
He worshiped Odin not some
woodworker nailed to a cross.

147
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,760
And I'll be damned if it was
anything but a bear!

148
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,400
First Gunnar, now us.

149
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,800
Three of my men are missing
five are dead.

150
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,800
May Odin keep them.

151
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,600
So why don't you tell me
about your dragon?

152
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,760
My people call it a Moorwen.

153
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,000
A Moorwen?

154
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,000
I've never even heard of such a thing.

155
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,400
Believe me.

156
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,720
The first time I saw one,

157
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,760
I didn't know what I was looking at.

158
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,040
It was just a smudge of
light in the darkness.

159
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,520
It could have been anything.

160
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,000
That's how it draws
its prey in, with light.

161
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,040
Foxfire.

162
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,120
It kills men, beasts, everything.

163
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,240
And it smells like death.

164
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,880
There's nothing like that here.

165
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,680
Yes, there is.

166
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,680
Because I brought it here.

167
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,640
Silence!

168
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,200
Leave him!

169
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,720
Come here!

170
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,720
You say you're responsible for this.

171
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,080
Yes.

172
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,400
It got on my ship, it killed my crew.

173
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,080
Then we crashed here.

174
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,400
I know you don't believe me...

175
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,760
but this thing has carved out
a territory and you are in it.

176
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,160
You think you can frighten us
with children's stories.

177
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,040
This is no story.

178
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,520
But whatever you think did this,

179
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,880
you're going to hunt it down
aren't you?

180
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,440
Take me with you.

181
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,120
How am I supposed to
fight it like this?

182
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,560
You're not.

183
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,640
That one's yours.

184
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,680
What do I do with it?

185
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,120
Hey! What do I with it?

186
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,560
Outlander.

187
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,280
Enough! Mount up.

188
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,800
How's your jaw?

189
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,960
Your jaw!

190
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,480
Freya?

191
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,720
Here. Try some of this.

192
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,360
Cure anything from a sword
in the guts to a broken heart.

193
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,760
You shouldn't feel too bad.

194
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,600
You see that?

195
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,120
She once stuck me with a fork.

196
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,560
It seems I got a little too
familiar when I was in me cups.

197
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,920
Well, go on! Drink!

198
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,960
Good, eh?

199
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,560
What is it?

200
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,880
What is it!

201
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,840
What kind of backwater are you from?

202
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,400
Some place far from here.

203
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,400
For certain.

204
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,360
Far off and sad that's
not tasted Herot mead.

205
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,800
Boromir likes his drink.

206
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,840
You know, Outlander...

207
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,760
we trade in every direction
for a thousand miles.

208
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,040
South, east and west, not north.

209
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,800
There's nothing there.

210
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,440
Maybe you haven't
looked far enough.

211
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,080
Perhaps.

212
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,920
But what's a man who lives so far
north doing in these seas?

213
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,160
We have an outpost near here.

214
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,320
And that's where this Moorwen
got on board your ship?

215
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,240
Yes.

216
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,040
And what it did to your village
it did to mine.

217
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,640
We were taking the bodies
back for a burial.

218
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,160
That's when it must
have gotten onboard.

219
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,080
Hold up!

220
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,200
Bear came this way.

221
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,920
There's been a lot of
animals through here since.

222
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,640
We should split up
try to find the main trail.

223
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,240
That's a bad idea.

224
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,960
We should stay together.

225
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,320
We'll pair up.

226
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,760
Wulfric, you take the Outlander.

227
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,720
A bear wouldn't do this.

228
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,680
It's here.

229
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,560
Wulfric! Wait!

230
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,720
Now that's a bear.

231
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,880
Outlander!

232
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,600
Take this sword.

233
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,800
And your life, too.

234
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,360
It's yours again.

235
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:25,760
Wulfric! Wulfric!

236
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,560
Kainan!

237
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,960
Kainan! Kainan!

238
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,960
Sit here!

239
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,120
Be my guest tonight.

240
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,280
Daughter! Kainan needs some drink.

241
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,960
See, now you look like a Viking.

242
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,440
Doesn't he, Freya?

243
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,680
Perhaps.

244
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,600
Nobody cooks this better
than my kitchen.

245
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,840
Eat!

246
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:09,080
There I was, running into
the cave ahead of everyone...

247
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,480
when suddenly, out of nowhere
came the biggest...

248
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,920
most vicious bear I've ever seen.

249
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,360
He tore up two grown men...

250
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,880
and was about to eat
the king himself...

251
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,720
when the Outlander stuck
his sword in it.

252
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,440
You see, the bear was there.

253
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,840
No! There!

254
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,200
And Rothgar was... Rothgar was here.

255
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,400
What's this?

256
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,680
Creeping into Shield Hall uninvited.

257
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,800
Off you go!

258
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,040
Wait!

259
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,760
What's your name?

260
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,920
Answer him, lad.

261
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,920
Here. Are you hungry?

262
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,800
He wants to see the sword
that killed the bear.

263
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,160
No.

264
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,600
I'll trade you for your name.

265
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,000
Eric.

266
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,760
Eric.

267
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:37,000
A sword for a name.

268
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,600
Just bring it back in one piece.

269
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,360
His parents were killed
by raiders a year ago.

270
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,320
The boy'll be fine.

271
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,840
We take care of our own.

272
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,000
Shields!

273
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,920
Shields!

274
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,240
Shields! it is.

275
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:19,000
Shield! Shield! Shield!

276
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,560
You!

277
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,680
Kainan!

278
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,080
You.

279
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:54,000
Kainan! Kainan! Kainan!

280
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,400
Up!

281
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,240
Kainan! Kainan!

282
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,040
What now?

283
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,440
Follow me.

284
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,000
The Outlander's good.

285
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,600
Care to wager some gold on him?

286
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,680
No one beats Wulfric at shields.

287
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,560
Kainan!

288
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,920
Now you try this.

289
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,320
Oh hell.

290
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,320
Are you ready for this, Boromir?

291
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,960
I am now.

292
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,760
Okay.

293
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,240
Not bad.

294
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,600
Sorry.

295
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,320
Outlander, I wanted...

296
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,640
Kainan.

297
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,200
My name is Kainan.

298
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,960
Kainan,

299
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,480
I wanted to thank you for
bringing my father back to me.

300
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,400
For saving his life.

301
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:27,280
It happened so fast
I did it without thinking.

302
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,520
Like when you hit me?

303
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,560
Hit you?

304
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,280
Yes, sorry about that.

305
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,040
We're even now.

306
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,160
All the women are talking about you.

307
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,280
They say you're from a place
far beyond the ice.

308
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,840
I heard one say from
the home of the gods.

309
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,680
What do you think?

310
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,840
I think...

311
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,840
she was a little drunk.

312
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,720
Freya!

313
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,360
Everyone thinks that
bear killed your people.

314
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,440
It didn't.

315
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,240
It was the Moorwen and
it will come back.

316
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,600
Get the others!

317
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,440
It's Gunnar!

318
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,520
Get out of here!

319
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,360
Get out of here!

320
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,560
Get out of here!

321
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,760
Rothgar!

322
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,360
It's over. We've lost!

323
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,520
No!

324
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:56,920
Let me go!

325
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,520
Get your hands off me!

326
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,240
Rothgar!

327
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,040
The gate. Close the gate!

328
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,920
Rothgar!

329
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,120
Where are you
you bastard son of a bitch?

330
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,200
Where's my wife?

331
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,520
Where's my boy?

332
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,040
You didn't even leave me their bodies.

333
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,440
If it takes a thousand years

334
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,520
I'll carve your heart out
of your rotting chest.

335
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,120
Do you hear me?

336
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,480
This is the man you want
to make peace with?

337
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,320
Are you all right?

338
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,000
I'm fine.

339
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,560
That looks deep.

340
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,160
Here let me clean it.

341
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,560
What happened out there?

342
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,240
Who was that?

343
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,520
That was Gunnar.

344
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,240
Gunnar?

345
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,240
King Halga, Wulfric's father...

346
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,680
called all the tribes together
for a raid on the Franks.

347
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,400
Gunnar never showed.

348
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,960
There was an ambush and
Halga was killed.

349
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,760
So Wulfric thinks
Gunnar betrayed him.

350
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,360
And Gunnar thinks his village
was destroyed in revenge.

351
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,080
That's right.

352
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,040
Wulfric is simple like his father.

353
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,960
He'll send a party into
the trees just before dawn.

354
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,960
And then attack from the main
gate first light.

355
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,200
But I think he's in for a surprise.

356
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,280
Gunnar said wait here.

357
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,400
Aethril?

358
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,400
Circle up. Circle up!

359
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,120
Get Wulfric and Rothgar up here now!

360
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:23,880
What's going on?

361
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,240
Wulfric!

362
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,840
Wait! Don't shoot!

363
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,960
Hold your fire. We surrender.

364
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,240
It's a trick.

365
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,960
Archers!

366
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,600
Ready!

367
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,320
Fire!

368
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,600
Wait!

369
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,800
Hold your fire, you bastards!

370
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:03,960
Wait!

371
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:14,760
No!

372
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,840
Open the gates!

373
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,440
Wulfric! No!

374
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,560
Look!

375
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,720
Now that is not a bear.

376
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,880
It was like hitting a stone wall.

377
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,040
I hit it with all I had.

378
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,880
Ran. Just like you ran from my father.

379
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,800
I'll cut your tongue out, boy.
Stop!

380
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,200
Both of you.

381
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,400
That thing is still out there!

382
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,840
The gods have cursed us all.

383
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,440
We should leave this place while
we can still save our families.

384
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,400
This is our home!

385
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,320
We are not going to let
that thing chase us out!

386
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,640
She's right! We're not leaving.

387
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,240
We're going to hunt this thing
down and kill it like Vikings.

388
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,880
Hunting won't work.

389
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,800
You can't take it on in the open.

390
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:27,760
It's too powerful.

391
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,120
Well, what else is there?

392
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,640
We trap it.

393
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,320
Even if you do track it down,

394
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,200
How are you going to kill it?

395
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,600
Why are we even listening to him?
He's not one of us.

396
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,080
That's right. I'm not.

397
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,800
But you're wrong about this, Wulfric.

398
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,520
Like you were wrong about and the bear.

399
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,600
And you'll always be wrong until
you stop thinking with this.

400
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,440
This is finished!

401
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,040
You're not one of us.

402
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,000
The decision is ours.

403
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,640
However, I'm still your king.

404
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,200
And my judgment is that
the Outlander is correct.

405
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,480
We build the trap.

406
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,240
So,

407
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,120
where do we start?

408
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,440
Here...

409
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,440
And ending... here.

410
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,520
What are you waiting for?

411
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,280
Dig!

412
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,760
The forge, what does it burn?

413
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,280
Wood.

414
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,720
What about the torches, the lamps?

415
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,280
Whale oil.

416
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:09,840
I'll need it.

417
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:10,960
How much?

418
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,360
All of it.

419
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,040
How's it coming?

420
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,040
Is it deep enough for you?

421
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,040
No.

422
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,440
Four more feet.

423
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,200
And when you got that...

424
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,960
I need two rows of postholes
running up both sides.

425
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,160
Post holes?

426
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:48,680
Yeah.

427
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,920
What do you need post holes for?

428
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,400
Posts.

429
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:53,680
Posts.

430
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,680
Posts.

431
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,200
Are we done now?

432
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,360
Not yet.

433
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,800
Not yet? What's left?

434
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,560
Shields?

435
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:31,920
Shields.

436
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,880
When this thing is over...

437
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,120
...there's a place here for you.

438
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,000
Should you wish it.

439
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,320
You hungry?

440
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,200
What about you?

441
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,640
I'll eat when you're finished.

442
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:53,880
No.

443
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,360
You sit.

444
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,520
Thank you.

445
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,280
I saw you talking to my father today.

446
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,280
What did he say?

447
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,880
He asked me to stay.

448
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,280
What did you say?

449
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:33,040
Freya...

450
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,320
You don't even know
what kind of man I am.

451
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,440
I know enough.

452
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,120
No, you don't.

453
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,520
So, tell me.

454
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,440
Kainan?

455
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,400
My people are no different than yours.

456
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:10,960
Hungry for land.

457
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,360
So when we found
an island we wanted,

458
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,200
we took it.

459
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,920
It didn't matter that it already
belonged to something else...

460
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,560
Moorwens. Millions of them.

461
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,600
But we wanted it.

462
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:45,320
After all, we told ourselves
they were nothing.

463
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,840
Just animals. Beasts.

464
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:59,320
So we killed them all with fire.

465
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,680
Those we missed, we hunted down.

466
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,360
You obeyed your king's orders.

467
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:08,840
You didn't have a choice.

468
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,640
You always have a choice.

469
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:19,040
Land that belonged to the Moorwens
now belonged to us.

470
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:35,440
As part of my pay I was given a place
for my family to live.

471
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,680
And I thought I could forget
what I'd done to get it.

472
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,880
Some things you can't
bury deep enough.

473
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,480
Hey! What are you doing?

474
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,920
That plant, it stung me.
It what?

475
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,760
It stung me.

476
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:53,200
Let me show you something.
Stay right here, okay?

477
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,000
Kainan.

478
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:20,680
The guns are up.

479
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,640
And there are none of them left.

480
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:24,880
You'll be safe.

481
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:31,880
I love you.

482
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,440
I love you, too.

483
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,840
Three weeks later I got word that
one of the Moorwens had survived.

484
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,320
And it got in our compound
and killed everyone.

485
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:16,800
It was the will of the gods.

486
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:17,640
It was their destiny.

487
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,240
There is no destiny.

488
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,920
There is no gods.

489
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,120
It was just me.

490
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,000
And I failed them.

491
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:35,720
I failed them.

492
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,280
This is a king's sword,

493
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,240
passed down from my ancestors.

494
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,720
My father gave it to me...

495
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,480
and told me that one day

496
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,640
I would know the man to give it to.

497
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,760
A good man.

498
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:20,400
If you truly believe that you
write the tale of your own life...

499
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:24,680
...then the end is up to you.

500
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:57,600
More arrows!

501
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,440
The gods be with you.

502
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,040
Boromir, close the doors.

503
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,120
Open the gates!

504
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:53,960
You sure this will work?

505
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:00,840
That's what I thought.

506
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:05,000
Hold this.

507
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,160
Gods above...

508
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,840
Wait for my order!

509
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,160
What's your damn priest doing?

510
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,120
I command thee, Lucifer,

511
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:39,880
quit this place!

512
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,040
Ready!

513
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:22,880
Wulfric!

514
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:25,760
Hold your fire!

515
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:28,040
Shoot!

516
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:28,800
Take my hand!

517
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:29,480
Shoot!

518
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,920
Hold!
Take it now!

519
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,480
Fire!

520
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,960
By the gods!

521
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:22,840
Freya?

522
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,400
Freya!

523
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:29,760
Freya!

524
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,320
Moorwen!

525
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:03,040
Kainan

526
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,000
There's another one!

527
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:19,960
Kainan!

528
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:23,240
everyone's leaving.

529
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,440
Eric, it's not safe here anymore.

530
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,880
Everyone's going to the boats.

531
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:37,080
You need to go, too.

532
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,320
But, I want to stay here with you.

533
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:42,080
You'll come back soon.

534
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,600
Everyone will.

535
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,240
You promise?

536
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,160
I promise.

537
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,400
Your boots, do you want them back?

538
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:35,800
No. They're his now.

539
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,280
What are you going to do?

540
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,400
You're king now.

541
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:44,840
King of what? This?

542
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,960
This... and them...

543
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,640
Whatever Herot becomes tomorrow...

544
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,160
will be because of
what you do right now.

545
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,160
Let's go kill this thing...

546
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,400
...together.

547
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:28,360
You're daft!

548
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:30,400
We're not going down there.

549
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:32,040
That's where it came from.

550
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,480
That's where we're going.

551
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,840
But we don't know how to kill it yet.

552
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:36,960
We need better weapons.

553
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:39,000
No. We need better metal.

554
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,640
Boromir, get the forge ready.

555
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:45,560
Unferth, Olaf, get the torches
and the ropes.

556
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Let's go.

557
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:49,440
I'm coming with you.

558
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:53,840
No you're not.

559
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:58,520
That thing killed my father and
destroyed my home.

560
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:00,080
I'm coming with you.

561
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,200
This is where your ship went down?

562
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:11,040
That's right.

563
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:18,160
In a lake?

564
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,240
Don't ask.

565
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:19,240
Kainan?

566
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:49,920
Freya?

567
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,160
Freya?

568
01:22:58,360 --> 01:22:59,440
Where's Freya?

569
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:01,760
Just get the metal and make the swords!

570
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Damn.

571
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:18,520
What kind of metal is this?

572
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:35,120
King's sword again.

573
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,840
You're...
I know. Daft.

574
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,120
Let's go.

575
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,040
Where's it coming from?

576
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:03,400
It's beneath us.

577
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:29,720
God.

578
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,960
I slipped.

579
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:49,880
Let's keep moving.

580
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:00,880
Ain't nothing down there.

581
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,640
Unferth!
Wulfric!

582
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:17,920
Can you see anything?

583
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:20,320
Over here!

584
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:45,520
Boromir!

585
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:12,360
We'll drink together again, Kainan.

586
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,240
Herot mead.

587
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,280
Best in the world.

588
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,840
No!

589
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,520
Kainan!

590
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,840
Freya! Freya...!

591
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,160
Kainan!

592
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:52,800
That way!

593
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,040
Freya!

594
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:58,560
I'm here.

595
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:42,400
Freya, Freya.

596
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:52,360
Freya!

597
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,600
Freya. Squeeze through!

598
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:03,200
Squeeze through!

599
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,480
Too tight.

600
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:07,040
Take it!

601
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:29,080
Freya, calm down, calm down.

602
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:36,560
By all the gods.

603
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:01,120
Move!

604
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:33,560
Over there!

605
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:48,840
Get her out of here!

606
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:56,560
Come on!

607
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:07,960
Swing me!

608
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:33,200
Wulfric!

609
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:20,840
Is it dead?

610
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:24,440
Yes.

611
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:38,040
I wanted this for so long.

612
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:44,440
At least I got to wear it for a day.

613
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:51,480
I hope you wear it for
longer than I did.

614
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:56,120
We could have been friends.

615
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:57,920
We are friends.

616
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:43,080
Eric.

617
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:44,280
Up here!

618
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,400
Up here!

619
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:48,440
Up here!

620
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:50,000
Up here!

621
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:06,960
You wait here for the others.

622
01:41:08,440 --> 01:41:09,920
I've got something to do.

623
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:13,400
You're not coming back, are you?

624
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:12,160
In the year of Four Kings,

625
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:16,120
Rothgar and Wulfric were laid to rest.

626
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:19,240
Heroes in the war against the Moorwens.

627
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:38,680
And Kainan, once a stranger to us...

628
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:40,760
...became king.

629
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:46,200
He took for himself a wife... and a boy,

630
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:48,600
who became as his own son.

631
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,960
But only I knew his secret.

632
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:28,880
That the gods had sent us Kainan.

633
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:34,000
And when it came time
to return to them...

634
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,440
...he chose to stay with us instead.
