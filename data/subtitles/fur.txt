Englewood, Englewood,

2
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,926
Anyone for Englewood,

3
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,797
Hello,

4
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,028
Mrs, Arbus?

5
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,141
That's right,

6
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:05,805
I'm Jack Henry,

7
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,679
Welcome to Camp Venus,

8
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,508
It's terrific to be here,

9
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,653
- Come on in,
- Thank you,

10
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:22,657
I don't wanna be any bother,

11
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:27,596
Oh, no, not at all, We're delighted
to have a photographer here,

12
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,591
It's simply...

13
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:34,399
I n order to get permission,
you must take them off,

14
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,976
No one ever mentioned that,

15
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,546
And there are two rules,

16
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,316
- Yes?
- The first one is:

17
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,754
No erections,

18
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,088
And no staring,

19
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,126
I'm sorry,

20
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,666
Please, go ahead and disrobe,
Ms, Arbus,

21
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,771
- We're used to it, Aren't we, Jack?
- Hm,

22
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:12,339
To tell you the truth, I need
a moment to myself, if that's all right,

23
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,743
- I understand,
- We'll leave you alone,

24
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,520
Oh,

25
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,686
How pretty,

26
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,692
Belonged to a friend,

27
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,303
Okay, boys, let's move them in,

28
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,607
- Jimmy, get in the back,
- Okay, boss,

29
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,409
Mother?

30
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:03,015
Grandma and Grandpa are here,

31
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,282
Thank you, Gracie,

32
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:28,709

So it's a real family business,

37
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,920

There must be someone
moving in upstairs,

42
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,371
Clearly,

43
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,776
There was no way for me to know
this would happen tonight, Mother,

44
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,647

,,, you gave it to me, Mother,

49
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,624

58
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,317
Diane,

59
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,418
- Not now,
- Come on,

60
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,455
Here, let me help you with that, Rose,

61
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,725
Your father's already driving me nuts,

62
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,450
I know, Allan,

63
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,530
- He wanted to trim it with monkey,
- A monkey?

64
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,495
I said no,

65
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,327
To all the greatest fur buyers in America:

66
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:35,507
My wife, Gertrude, and I welcome you
to my daughter's home,

67
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,074
Thank you all for coming,

68
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,471
She's really something,

69
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:41,307
Thank you all for taking the time
to join us this evening,

70
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,278
As you know, for the past 30 years,,,

71
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,010
,,, Russeks has been
the biggest buyer of pelts,,,

72
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,278
,,, and producers of fur garments
in the world,

73
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,719
And like us, you all don't want to let
only New York ladies,,,

74
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,883
- ,,, have the luxury of world-class furs,
- I need gloves, Like this?

75
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,858
- Now, do we?
- Of course not,

76
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,495
- So without further ado,,,
- Finally!

77
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:03,102
,,, ladies and gentlemen,
observe the fox,

78
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:08,104
Stealthy, luxurious,
the colors of autumn,

79
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:12,502
Each individual coat
truly a thing of beauty,

80
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,975
Lustrous, dark-hued,
naturally cloud-soft,

81
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,677
Crafted with the distinctive flair
and elegant styling,,,

82
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:25,290
,,, women of discriminating taste have
come to expect from Russeks furs,

83
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,183
And the leopard,

84
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,353
The spotted and graceful dancer
of the jungle,

85
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:36,368
Notice the matching hat, purse, mirror
and cosmetic case,

86
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,530
This prestigious ensemble will be
the cornerstone,,,

87
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,709
,,, of our fall advertising campaign,
to be photographed, of course,,,

88
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,879
,,, by the Allan Arbus
Family Photo Studio which later...

89
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:53,213
There really isn't an occasion when
you can't wear leopard,

90
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,330
Friends, prepare yourselves,,,

91
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:12,562
,,, for the unbearably soft appeal
of chinchilla,

92
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:18,034
The silkiest and most sensual fur
that money can buy,

93
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:21,042
This one's jammed, Get me
the Hasselblad with the wide-angle,

94
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,613
Okay,

95
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,410
- This delicate fur,,,,
- Excuse me,

96
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,113
- and certainly,

97
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,991
- All set, Charlie,
- Got everything?

98
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:43,499
That's it,

99
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,571
Good luck to you,

100
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,388
Diane? You got it?

101
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:43,688
- What?
- The Hasselblad,

102
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,093
Yes, yes, I'm sorry,

103
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,391
Come on,

104
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,228
Let's go upstairs for the studio tour,,,

105
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:52,735
,,, take a look at the wonderful work
my son-in-law's doing,

106
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,874
Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Seventeen,

107
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,476
My husband has...
Has shot campaigns for,,,

108
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:02,444
,,, Chock full of Nuts, Sunbeam
and many more,

109
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:07,552
But his main focus for the past 10 years
has been the daily new Russeks ads,,,

110
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,180
,,, for my father's world-renowned store
that run in The New York Times,

111
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,521
May I ask, uh, what do you photograph,
Diane?

112
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:21,730
Me? Um, oh, no, I'm...
I'm not the photographer,

113
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,096
No, my husband is,

114
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,294
But, uh, what do you do?

115
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,464
Um,,,,

116
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,210
Well, I,,,,

I take light readings and I, uh...
I... I... iron clothes,

118
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,050
I, um,,,,

119
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:46,315
I provide straws for the models so that
their lipstick doesn't smudge, and I, uh,,,

120
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:50,087
,,, I accessorize their clothes,
I rearrange their hair,

121
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:53,460
I... It's not that much,

122
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:58,229
Diane, uh, do you have any fashion tips
for a friend?

123
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:02,333
Um, as a matter of fact, yes, yes, I do,

124
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,400
One's, um,,,,

125
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:10,205
One's nails should, um... Should only be
slightly longer than the pads of,,,,

126
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,941
Of one's,,,,

127
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,984
One's fingertips, and,,,,

128
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,986
For chrissake, what now?

Excuse me,

130
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,821
- Are you all right?
- I'm sorry,

131
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:33,734
Everyone, dessert is served
downstairs in the living room,

132
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,573
Diane?

133
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,448

Yes,

Diane?

141
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,488
Maybe you should take some time off,

142
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,831
- Allan,
- I could hire an assistant,

143
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:18,426
I bought you that square-format camera
10 years ago,,,

144
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,264
,,, you haven't even used it, Diane,

145
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,041
Maybe you could take a class,

146
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,881
Is that your secret?

147
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,255
Yes,

148
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,415
My answer is no,
I'm not gonna leave you during the day,

149
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,585
What's yours?

150
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,795
Come on, tell me, What's your secret?

151
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,176
I unbuttoned my dress
on the porch tonight,

152
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,575
What?

153
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:04,410
Allan, I,,,,

154
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,646
I don't wanna be like that,

155
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:09,879
Like what?

156
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:13,081
I'm your wife, I shouldn't do that,

157
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,117
Dee,,,,

158
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,361
You know I think you're brilliant,

159
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,560
- No, you think I'm strange,,,
- No,

160
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,704
,,, that I can't be normal,

161
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:28,997
I never said that,

162
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:33,274
Even our own children
think I'm strange,

163
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:35,946
I love you,

164
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,091
I love you,

165
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,328
Good night, sweetheart,

166
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:32,067
Good night,

167
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:54,947
What do you think?

168
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,247
I don't know,

169
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,219
I don't know, It's all so predictable,

170
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,161
You know we have the golf course
in about 20 minutes,

171
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:09,699
With swimsuits and puppies,

172
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,332
The client's gonna love it,

173
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,301
Mm-hmm,

174
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:17,831
Mother?

175
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:22,104
- Go ahead, take it,
- Okay,

176
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:23,773
What is it, Grace?

177
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,243
There's something wrong
with the plumbing,

178
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,224
I need you to turn off
the main water valve, the big one,,,

179
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,990
,,, and bring me Daddy's tool kit
and a bucket,

180
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,531
- You're a good girl,
- Okay, Mom,

181
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,131
Uh, Grace, tissue,

182
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,228
Trash,

183
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,299
Oh, yuck,

184
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,848
Oh,

185
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,688
Ew!

186
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,737
What was that?

187
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,099
It's nothing,

188
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:33,139
Okay, Gracie, let's go,

189
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,252
Taxi!

190
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,394
Yes?

191
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,762
Are you washing a dog?

192
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,397
Excuse me?

193
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,337
Do you have a large dog?

194
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,963
A dog?

195
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:43,673
Your dog's hair is in my pipes,
It's causing problems with the plumbing,

196
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:47,051
Perhaps you should check
the basement,,,

197
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,010
,,, Diane,

198
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:03,419
Hello,

199
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,933
Are you a new neighbor?

200
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,972
- I'm a friend of Lionel's,
- Lionel?

201
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:18,105
The man who lives upstairs?

202
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:27,048
Oh, I'm sorry, I'll, uh, get out of your way,

203
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:21,662
Time to sleep now, Gracie,

204
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:23,807
Okay, Mom,

205
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,460
Allan,

206
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:16,704
Christ, what is that?!

207
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,758
I fixed my drain for you,

208
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,671
Thank you,

209
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,934
You still think I have a dog?

210
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:55,275
I have 10 dogs,

211
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:59,211
I don't think you have a dog,

212
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:02,581
I haven't seen any dogs
going up the stairs,

213
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:07,817
I'm not feeling very well right now,
I can't find my rabbit,

214
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:14,130
Oh, okay, Then I'll, uh,,,,
I'll... I'll come back later,

215
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:29,678
You saw me the night
I moved in, remember?

216
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,577
Yes,

217
00:32:33,752 --> 00:32:36,619
I definitely saw you,

218
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,420
You trying to seduce me, Diane?

219
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,253
No,

220
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,159
- No,
- No?

221
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,489
God, no,

222
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:49,361
Is that why you came up here
in the middle of the night?

223
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,395
I, um,,,,

224
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,374
Well, I would like to, uh,,,,

225
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:03,244
I'd like to take a portrait
of you and your,,,, Your wife,

226
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:06,476
I don't have a wife,

227
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:13,457
Well, then I would like to take
a portrait of you, just you,

228
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:16,994
When?

229
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,692
Now,

230
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:26,500
It's not a good time for me,

231
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,907
Come back tomorrow night at 9,

232
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,204
Tomorrow?

233
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:36,173
Okay,

234
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,042
Okay,

235
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:47,253
Do you have trouble sleeping, Diane?

236
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:53,392
Actually, it's "Diane,"

237
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:59,429
Why would you want to take a portrait
of someone you've never seen, Diane?

238
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:07,110
Most nights I have trouble sleeping,

239
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,447
Did you get the key?

240
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,943
The key?

241
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:20,152
Diane, come back tomorrow night at 9,

242
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,132
Hey, watch it, Vern,

243
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,609
I forgot something,

244
00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:59,486
Looks like gin rummy,

245
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:05,758
Foo-Foo, don't you bother Donald, now,
you keep still for Mummy,

246
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,761
They're adorable, aren't they?

247
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:10,025
And such beautiful coats,

248
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,485
I'll be to bed soon, darling,

249
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:40,725
I,,,,

250
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:43,094
I thought I'd go for a walk,

251
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:44,701
Okay,

252
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,427
Be careful,

253
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,421
Lionel?

254
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,449
Hello?

255
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:20,428
Hello?

256
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:47,847
Lionel?

257
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,537
Do not go near him,
ladies and gentlemen,

258
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,682
He has taken lives already,

259
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:51,117
In captivity, we have the upper hand,

260
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:55,217
But isn 't Lionel a good doggie?

261
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:39,570
Drink a cup,

262
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:29,886
Turn around,

263
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,880
Don't look at me,

264
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:42,664
Turn around,

265
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:58,213
Take off your camera,

266
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:02,545
Just put it on the table,

267
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:25,275
Please close your eyes now,

268
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:28,040
I only wanna take your portrait,

269
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,645
Diane,,,

270
00:42:30,248 --> 00:42:34,947
,,, please close your eyes,

271
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,451
Step back from the window,

272
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:56,338
Are your eyes closed?

273
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:57,701
Yes,

274
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:09,818
Don't turn around,
Keep your eyes closed,

275
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:13,688
- And please disrobe,
- What?

276
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:17,919
You can keep your undergarments on
if you like, The bath is getting cold,

277
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:21,954
I don't want to,

278
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:44,348
I think I should go,

279
00:44:00,705 --> 00:44:02,434
I'm sorry,

280
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,632
Hello,

281
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:40,108
Take anything in your tea?

282
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:55,257
Now, tell me something,

283
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,557
Tell me something about yourself,

284
00:44:58,763 --> 00:45:00,253
Are you rich?

285
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:03,262
You look rich,

286
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,061
My parents are,

287
00:45:05,236 --> 00:45:07,227
So you were a spoiled child?

288
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:11,331
Did you eat caviar?
Did you have servants?

289
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:13,777
Yes,

290
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,012
What were their names?

291
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,281
Scott was my chauffeur,,,

292
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:25,116
,,, Gisela was my German nanny,
and Catherine was my French nanny,

293
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:28,089
Did you ever show your nanny
your tits?

294
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:32,987
Now, when you were a teenager,,,

295
00:45:33,164 --> 00:45:38,192
,,, there must have been a doorman
you made love to in the basement,,,

296
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:42,135
,,, or a chauffeur, a gardener,
an elevator man?

297
00:45:42,373 --> 00:45:45,706
Did you ever give him a blowjob
on the way down to the lobby?

298
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:47,844
- No,
- No?

299
00:45:49,647 --> 00:45:51,706
Did he want you to?

300
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:58,678
Well, did he?

301
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:00,323
Probably,

302
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:02,589
How could you tell?

303
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:05,885
I,,,,

304
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:11,067
He used to stop the elevator
between floors,

305
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:14,604
And?

306
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:16,897
And stare at me,

307
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:20,743
Did you like that?

308
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,343
It terrified me,

309
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:25,675
Of course, but,,,,

310
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:28,344
But did you like it?

311
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,817
One time I showed him my underwear,

312
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:35,253
So? Then I'm right,

313
00:46:35,426 --> 00:46:38,418
Chauffeured girls don't
expose themselves,

314
00:46:38,596 --> 00:46:40,086
They don't show their tits,

315
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:43,927
- Don't they?
- I don't know, Do they? You tell me,

316
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,467
Where have you been hiding?

317
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:56,570
I suppose I did, I exposed myself,

318
00:46:56,714 --> 00:46:58,739
Till my father caught me,

319
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:00,543
Where did this occur?

320
00:47:00,718 --> 00:47:02,845
- I n the bathroom,
- To whom?

321
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,783
To the neighbors,

322
00:47:07,091 --> 00:47:10,060
I would touch myself
in front of the window,

323
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:11,819
Really?

324
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,930
Did you ever see anyone watching?

325
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,534
I saw you,,,

326
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:23,938
,,, through my window,

327
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:28,041
And right away I wanted to come
into your home,

328
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:37,510
And when you were young, did anyone
like me ever come to your house?

329
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:46,418
There was a little boy, He had,,,,

330
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:49,464
He had a purple birthmark
across his face,

331
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,601
I saw him in the park and I,,,,

332
00:47:51,769 --> 00:47:56,001
I followed him all the way
to his front door in the Bronx,

333
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:59,073
But he disappeared before I could,,,,

334
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:04,407
Shortly after that,
I dropped doing that sort of thing,

335
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:07,608
And I planned on going so many places,

336
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:10,753
Where?

337
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:13,014
All sorts of places, everywhere,

338
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,623
Where? Tell me,

339
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:19,559
A doll hospital,,,

340
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:22,462
,,, the city morgue,,,

341
00:48:23,968 --> 00:48:26,061
,,, the insane asylum,,,

342
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:30,571
,,, dumps, flophouses, everywhere, I,,,,

343
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:34,609
And instead,
I was my husband's assistant,

344
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,281
Join me?

345
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:14,807
Would you like to
take off your slippers?

346
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:33,431
Wanna step in?

347
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:15,040
My condition is called hypertrichosis,

348
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:17,576
When I was a teenager, I woke up
every morning at 5 a, m,,,

349
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:20,342
,,, to shave every part of me
that stuck out from my clothing,

350
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:24,317
Grew back so quickly
it was hardly worth the effort,

351
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,514
Besides, it made me prickly,

352
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:35,189
Would you please
close your eyes again?

353
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:42,300
Can I trust you to keep them closed?

354
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:43,973
Yes,

355
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:52,380
Well, just in case, put this on,

356
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:28,309
Do you like to go swimming?

357
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:30,911
Yes,

358
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:59,838
Did you get the key?

359
00:52:57,574 --> 00:52:59,633
That little boy,,,

360
00:53:00,244 --> 00:53:02,439
,,, was so beautiful,

361
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:03,665
Have a cookie,

362
00:54:07,945 --> 00:54:10,243
I must be brave,

363
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:14,810
I must be brave, I must be brave,

364
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:18,244
I must be brave,

365
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:07,569
Twenty, 19,

366
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:10,198
- Oh, my God!
- Good morning,

367
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:12,334
I'd better go,

368
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:18,013
Sleep all right?

369
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,079
Lint brush,

370
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:23,218
Thank you,

371
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,644
Will you come back?

372
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:29,223
Do you want me to?

373
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:32,184
You still need to take my portrait,

374
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:45,425
Tell me a secret,

375
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:50,831
I wanna live in a big house someday,

376
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:52,838
Out of the city,

377
00:56:53,477 --> 00:56:56,878
With a big back yard and a dog,

378
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,076
Leaving Manhattan gives me hives,

379
00:57:02,652 --> 00:57:04,847
Tell me another secret,

380
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:09,922
I actually had a dream we were
gonna have another baby,

381
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,152
A baby?

382
00:57:12,996 --> 00:57:14,258
Huh,

383
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:19,400
Now it's your turn, What's your secret?

384
00:57:20,971 --> 00:57:24,668
I think I'm ready to take
some time off from the business,

385
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:27,904
Really?

386
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:29,978
What are you gonna do instead?

387
00:57:30,514 --> 00:57:33,813
I'd like to take some photographs,,,

388
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:35,609
,,, of my own,

389
00:57:35,986 --> 00:57:37,476
Of what?

390
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:41,153
I don't know,

391
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,450
Our neighbors,

392
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:49,455
Good, Yeah,

393
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:53,759
I think that sounds great,

394
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:57,973
Allan?

395
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:02,072
Is it okay?

396
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:04,707
Sweetheart, it's wonderful,

397
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:38,904
Thanks, sweetheart,

398
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:43,251
Where you going?

399
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:46,286
Just up to the neighbors, I,,,,

400
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:49,516
I thought I'd try Mrs, Rebushong first,

401
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:52,052
Eat your broccoli, Sophie,

402
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:18,120
Who is she?

403
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:22,755
She is, uh, Althea,

404
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:24,223
Oh,

405
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:28,656
Uh, she's, uh,,,

406
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,430
,,, an admirer,

407
00:59:31,801 --> 00:59:34,292
- An admirer?
- Yes,

408
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:37,429
Who does she admire?

409
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:44,036
At me, I guess,

410
00:59:45,382 --> 00:59:47,373
Why isn't she your girlfriend?

411
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:51,210
Well,,,,

412
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:54,914
She doesn't touch me,

413
01:00:27,324 --> 01:00:29,315
Goddamn it,

414
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:00,453
Hey,

415
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:02,420
I'm here,

416
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:09,298
Lionel?

417
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,496
Lionel?

418
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:19,166
I'm here for the picture,

419
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:20,904
I'll be right there,

420
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:26,371
Hi,

421
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:32,746
Take off your camera,

422
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:36,417
- We're going out,
- Now?

423
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:43,088
Come on,

424
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:57,904
Ready or not, here I come,

425
01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:00,413
Come out, come out, wherever you are,

426
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,953
Okay, let's play again,

427
01:02:55,305 --> 01:02:57,432
- Scarlett,
- Lionel,

428
01:02:57,807 --> 01:02:59,798
Great to see you,

429
01:03:00,043 --> 01:03:01,374
Brought a wig and a friend,

430
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:04,009
Come on,

431
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:17,217
That's a good boy,

432
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:20,395
You're a good boy,

433
01:03:21,698 --> 01:03:23,359
That's it,

434
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:30,328
You're doing really, really good,

435
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:41,875
Would you like to get a bite to eat?

436
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:44,383
Now? I don't wanna go anywhere now,

437
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,749
This is terrific,

438
01:03:49,626 --> 01:03:52,026
Look at his socks,

439
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:55,895
I thought you might enjoy it,

440
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:16,510
- Thank you for coming,
- Jose, you know it's my pleasure,

441
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,984
You know, the fire left her with no hair,

442
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:21,646
Yes, well, you know,
this is close to her natural color,

443
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:23,257
Oh, you're a genius,

444
01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:25,223
Let's give it a try, huh?

445
01:04:25,395 --> 01:04:27,522
It's a wonderful thing, Extraordinary,

446
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,562
Anytime, sincerely,

447
01:05:17,947 --> 01:05:23,044
My mother made me swear I'd go through
life without ever seeing a dead person,

448
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:06,661
I like it,

449
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:08,623
It's not catching,

450
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:10,623
I know,

451
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,667
Elliot Eldemeyer told all the kids
in my school it was,

452
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:16,266
It's genetic, of course,

453
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:23,237
Do you know what
you look like without it?

454
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:25,444
- Without the hair?
- Mm-hmm,

455
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:28,712
I have no idea,

456
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:41,057
Mrs, Arbus,

457
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:05,912
Oh, Allan,

458
01:07:08,458 --> 01:07:10,483
I'm sorry, I,,,,

459
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:33,914
Did you have fun?

460
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:38,880
Allan,,,,

461
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,716
That feels good,

462
01:08:19,729 --> 01:08:22,163
- Does that feel good?
- Yes,

463
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:24,422
What do you like about it?

464
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:27,501
It scares me,

465
01:08:29,739 --> 01:08:30,728
I love you,

466
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,171
I love you,

467
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:07,675
Lionel?

468
01:09:09,212 --> 01:09:10,770
What's that?

469
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:15,979
I'd like to meet your husband,

470
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,992
What kind of Scotch is this?

471
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:01,260
That is Macallan,
Eighteen years, I think,

472
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:03,421
Good stuff, Like it,

473
01:10:04,467 --> 01:10:06,025
Well, good,

474
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:23,612
It's actually a gift from Diane's father,

475
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:25,786
The fur man,

476
01:10:32,028 --> 01:10:33,928
Do you like to watch television?

477
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:36,826
Had to take a lie-detector test,
it was awful,

478
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:39,229
You didn 't have to take it,
What'd you tell them?

479
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:41,097
Nothing important,

480
01:10:41,304 --> 01:10:42,737
Yeah, well, it's just as well,

481
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:45,430
Guess they would have
got suspicious if you had refused,

482
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:46,938
What'd they ask you?

483
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:49,407
- Lf I had a boyfriend,
- Well?

484
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:53,240
- Told them I didn 't,
- Thattagirl, thattagirl,

485
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:55,577
I'd only do it for you, Frank,

486
01:10:56,052 --> 01:10:57,986
It'll be all right, you'll see,

487
01:10:58,154 --> 01:10:59,815
I love you,

488
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:03,516
And when we 're married,
we 're going to forget all this, Promise,

489
01:11:03,693 --> 01:11:04,990
Yeah, sure,

490
01:11:11,701 --> 01:11:13,794
Sophie,

491
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:17,636
Sophie Arbus,,,,

492
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:37,017
Purple and pink,

493
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:45,358
Lionel,

494
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:49,597
This is another one for you,

495
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:52,797
Excellent work, Sophie,
Thank you, Soph,

496
01:11:54,577 --> 01:11:57,239
Yeah, but he likes me more,

497
01:12:25,307 --> 01:12:28,174
"It's all very well to say, 'Drink me',,,

498
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:32,007
,,, but the wise little Alice
was not going to do that,

499
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:34,979
'No, I'll look first,' she said,,,

500
01:12:35,151 --> 01:12:38,052
,,,'and see whether
it's marked "poison" or not,'

501
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:42,657
For she had read several stories about
children who had gotten burnt,,,

502
01:12:43,059 --> 01:12:46,085
- ,,, and eaten by wild beasts,"
- Hi,

503
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:48,590
Are you ready to go?

504
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:50,226
Mm-hm,

505
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:51,730
Are you coming back?

506
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:53,459
Of course,

507
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:55,731
Sleep tight,

508
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:22,858
- You're a flirt,
- I like it, I like it, I like it,

509
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:33,206
- I don't think this...
- Yes!

510
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:37,868
That's good, that's good,
Did you like me in that show?

511
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:40,447
You are such a bad girl,

512
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:42,408
What is this?

513
01:13:43,486 --> 01:13:45,545
- That's my tit, darling,
- Oh,

514
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:47,786
Let me show you,

515
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:51,254
Oh!

516
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,221
You like them?

517
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:55,727
Lionel is just the greatest, isn't he?

518
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,327
He is,

519
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:22,622
Sing it, Andy,

520
01:14:43,879 --> 01:14:45,346
Take me!

521
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:47,880
No, it's true, I wrote about,,,,

522
01:14:48,184 --> 01:14:49,776
Cheers, baby,

523
01:14:52,087 --> 01:14:54,749
If you don't mind me asking,,,

524
01:14:54,924 --> 01:14:56,824
,,, why did you drop the key down?

525
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:01,395
You looked like you needed
to come up to my place,

526
01:15:03,933 --> 01:15:06,902
Have you ever met a woman
who was also like you?

527
01:15:07,069 --> 01:15:09,401
Sure, it was like white on rice,

528
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:15,808
More libations?

529
01:15:19,615 --> 01:15:21,810
So you preferred other women?

530
01:15:21,984 --> 01:15:24,418
I was,,,, I was always,,,,

531
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:27,818
Always looking,

532
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:30,550
What were you looking for?

533
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:35,925
A real freak,

534
01:16:15,771 --> 01:16:18,262
- Medium, Shorty?
- Medium, yeah,

535
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:39,153
When did you do these?

536
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:41,262
1949,

537
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:44,422
One of many exciting humiliations,

538
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:47,334
Were you the best performer
at Hubert's?

539
01:16:47,503 --> 01:16:51,997
That was the Albanian contortionist,
but I was the biggest attraction,

540
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:56,976
- Can I ask you a question?
- Please,

541
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,813
Where is your favorite place to go?

542
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:03,741
The ocean,

543
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:06,179
Then why haven't we been?

544
01:17:08,524 --> 01:17:10,185
We will,

545
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:39,587
Is that the tooth fairy?

546
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:42,452
It's Mommy,

547
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:46,754
My tooth came out, Daddy was here,

548
01:17:46,929 --> 01:17:49,193
Oh, Sophie, I,,,,

549
01:17:50,966 --> 01:17:54,561
I'm sorry I missed it, I,,,,

550
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:56,738
It hurt,

551
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:03,072
I'm sorry,

552
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:25,859
I studied photography
in college at Bryn Mawr,

553
01:18:26,435 --> 01:18:30,030
But I also love fashion and advertising,

554
01:18:30,806 --> 01:18:32,330
Great, um,,,,

555
01:18:33,742 --> 01:18:36,233
My wife used to be my assistant,

556
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:39,073
Oh, and, uh, what does she do now?

557
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:42,577
- Hello,
- Hello,

558
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:44,849
This is Diane,

559
01:18:45,521 --> 01:18:47,512
Are you the new assistant?

560
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:50,115
I hope so,

561
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,453
All the way up, doctor,

562
01:20:33,095 --> 01:20:34,426
Hey,

563
01:20:35,063 --> 01:20:36,462
Hey,

564
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:49,643
Come on,

565
01:20:53,916 --> 01:20:55,508
Careful, careful,

566
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:57,374
- Hello,
- Hi,

567
01:20:57,553 --> 01:20:59,180
Welcome,

568
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:00,787
Just through here,

569
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:02,423
Lovely place,

570
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:04,354
Thank you for coming,

571
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:06,258
Careful there, Shorty,

572
01:21:07,162 --> 01:21:08,720
Nice to see you again,

573
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:11,688
Hello,

574
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:13,357
So good to have you,

575
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,730
Wonderful, yes,

576
01:21:15,938 --> 01:21:18,031
- Lionel,
- Allan,

577
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:21,004
Sophie, Grace, this is Hank,

578
01:21:21,176 --> 01:21:22,370
- Hi,
- Hello,

579
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:24,409
Gracie, I'm sure that Hank would like
to see your room,

580
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:26,514
You are so embarrassing,

581
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:32,786
Sophie, why don't you show Hank
your collection of dolls' eyes?

582
01:21:32,955 --> 01:21:34,320
Okay,

583
01:21:35,123 --> 01:21:37,614
How are the portraits coming?
I haven't seen any yet,

584
01:21:37,793 --> 01:21:39,283
Slowly,

585
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:41,059
Aren't they neat, Hank?

586
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:44,221
Slowly, but they're coming,

587
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:49,898
You're going down, Lionel,

588
01:21:50,505 --> 01:21:52,234
Oh, Satch, what do you got?

589
01:21:52,441 --> 01:21:53,999
I got you this time, pal,

590
01:21:54,209 --> 01:21:57,975
Satch has not much, But a full house!

591
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:00,839
It's a cocktail party,

592
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:03,849
My mother says I'm supposed to
be brave, whatever that means,

593
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:05,646
All dead bodies are cold,

594
01:22:05,821 --> 01:22:07,755
- Thank you,
- Something to eat?

595
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,417
Little salmon, Scarlett?

596
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:13,159
- Is there anything else I can get you?
- No, I'm good,

597
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:15,320
Drinks,

598
01:22:22,671 --> 01:22:24,263
Look, um,,,

599
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:26,664
,,, I'm sorry, but I can't stay,

600
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:28,333
What?

601
01:22:28,543 --> 01:22:31,341
Some of your father's clients are
in from Chicago, and,,,,

602
01:22:31,513 --> 01:22:34,107
I'd put them off, but I really should
meet up with them for a drink,

603
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:36,079
Allan,

604
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:39,516
- I wanted you to be...
- To what, Diane?

605
01:22:40,756 --> 01:22:41,950
To be a part of all of this,

606
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:44,058
I need to keep the business going,
you know?

607
01:22:44,226 --> 01:22:46,126
I know, right,

608
01:22:47,229 --> 01:22:48,719
Right,

609
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:51,931
Just,,,,

610
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:53,859
Come with me,

611
01:22:56,204 --> 01:22:58,604
Let them find their own drinks,

612
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:03,407
No, I can't do that,

613
01:23:06,882 --> 01:23:08,247
Okay,

614
01:23:10,152 --> 01:23:11,881
I gotta go,

615
01:23:53,562 --> 01:23:54,859
Dee?

616
01:23:56,832 --> 01:23:58,493
Are you coming?

617
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:29,663
- I don't know,
- Oh, never mind,

618
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:37,194
Mother, Father,,,

619
01:24:38,373 --> 01:24:41,308
,,, this is my friend,
Mr, Lionel Sweeney,

620
01:24:41,476 --> 01:24:44,274
What a pleasure it is to meet you both,

621
01:24:49,484 --> 01:24:51,042
How do you do?

622
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:57,758
Excuse me, everyone,
Shall we have a toast?

623
01:24:57,926 --> 01:24:59,621
Yes, do that,

624
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:02,823
- Come on, Allan,
- Well,,,,

625
01:25:03,398 --> 01:25:04,797
Uh,,,,

626
01:25:06,034 --> 01:25:08,901
I remember the first time I saw her,

627
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:11,265
She was dressed all in black,,,

628
01:25:11,473 --> 01:25:13,941
,,, and her hair was so thick,,,

629
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:16,975
,,, and it went all the way
past her shoulders down to her waist,

630
01:25:17,145 --> 01:25:18,510
She was only 15,

631
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,841
- Sixteen,
- Fifteen,

632
01:25:21,483 --> 01:25:23,246
You were the most,,,

633
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:25,811
,,, stunning,,,

634
01:25:26,721 --> 01:25:29,315
,,, inexplicable creature I'd ever seen,

635
01:25:33,228 --> 01:25:35,219
It was August 12th,,,

636
01:25:35,997 --> 01:25:37,157
,,, Sheep's Meadow,

637
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:40,665
She kept moving back and forth as if
she was dancing or something,,,

638
01:25:40,869 --> 01:25:43,633
,,, but that was just the way
she moved back then,

639
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:46,770
I couldn't take my eyes off you,

640
01:25:47,776 --> 01:25:50,301
I still can't take my eyes off you,

641
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:52,478
Allan,

642
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:58,046
Happy birthday, Diane,

643
01:25:58,220 --> 01:26:01,018
- Happy birthday,
- Hear, hear,

644
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:02,850
- Thank you,
- Yeah,

645
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:13,697
So, Lionel, you're Diane's
first project all on her own,

646
01:26:13,869 --> 01:26:14,927
Mother,

647
01:26:15,136 --> 01:26:18,264
Allan tells us you're doing
a little extra art project,,,

648
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:21,374
,,, a photo study of your neighbors,

649
01:26:22,544 --> 01:26:24,774
Yes, sort of,

650
01:26:26,047 --> 01:26:28,811
Why don't you be
a little portrait photographer?

651
01:26:28,984 --> 01:26:32,852
You've already got the studio,
People could just drop by,

652
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:35,455
Well, Mother, maybe I will,

653
01:26:35,624 --> 01:26:38,252
I mean, real art hangs in museums,
doesn't it?

654
01:26:38,426 --> 01:26:40,621
You know, I'm on the board
at the Metropolitan,

655
01:26:40,795 --> 01:26:43,923
- We know, Mother,
- We'd love to see what you've done,

656
01:26:44,099 --> 01:26:48,160
Well, I'm not ready to show
anything to anybody yet,

657
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:50,998
It's true,
She hasn't even shown me yet,

658
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:55,142
Allan, I told you I will, When I'm ready,

659
01:27:38,386 --> 01:27:39,876
What is it?

660
01:27:42,057 --> 01:27:44,252
Every month or so I'm,,,

661
01:27:45,126 --> 01:27:47,287
,,, able to breathe about 5 percent less,

662
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:51,922
My lungs are disintegrating,

663
01:27:56,371 --> 01:28:00,637
It's getting harder and harder
for me to breathe deeply,

664
01:28:01,543 --> 01:28:05,741
I n a matter of months,
I'll drown without even swimming,,,

665
01:28:06,181 --> 01:28:08,479
,,, because there'll be nothing left,,,

666
01:28:09,384 --> 01:28:10,749
,,, of my lungs,

667
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:32,766
You're not dying,

668
01:28:33,341 --> 01:28:35,866
Yes, I am,

669
01:28:36,077 --> 01:28:38,705
No, you're not,

670
01:29:16,284 --> 01:29:17,273
Come on,

671
01:29:42,577 --> 01:29:44,340
You've kissed him,

672
01:29:46,314 --> 01:29:49,283
No, Allan, No, I haven't,

673
01:29:49,451 --> 01:29:51,146
It doesn't matter
if you have or you haven't,

674
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:52,513
No,

675
01:29:52,821 --> 01:29:55,153
Allan, he's dying,

676
01:29:56,524 --> 01:29:57,821
Oh,

677
01:29:58,259 --> 01:30:01,228
That makes it even more special,
What'll happen after he dies?

678
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:04,092
- You encouraged me to do this,
- I encouraged you,,,

679
01:30:04,265 --> 01:30:06,756
,,, to take a few fucking pictures,

680
01:30:08,269 --> 01:30:10,396
You want me to just watch
my family fall apart?

681
01:30:10,605 --> 01:30:12,732
Am I supposed to do all the studio work,
run the business,,,

682
01:30:12,941 --> 01:30:15,239
,,, buy the food,
be the fucking tooth fairy?

683
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:17,970
Am I supposed to take care of the kids
all alone?

684
01:30:18,146 --> 01:30:22,344
What's next? Are we gonna house
the circus when it comes through town?

685
01:30:24,586 --> 01:30:26,383
I don't know,

686
01:30:37,065 --> 01:30:39,397
I'm just a normal guy,

687
01:30:39,834 --> 01:30:41,461
You know?

688
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:46,834
Now I got a hole in my ceiling
and fucking freaks coming through it,

689
01:30:52,247 --> 01:30:55,774
He's going to die anyway, Diane,

690
01:31:06,394 --> 01:31:08,362
Goddamn it,

691
01:31:15,537 --> 01:31:17,004
Okay,

692
01:31:17,705 --> 01:31:19,434
I'll end it,

693
01:32:35,183 --> 01:32:36,775
Close the door,

694
01:32:53,434 --> 01:32:55,231
I need you to help me,

695
01:32:57,805 --> 01:32:59,238
Lionel, I,,,,

696
01:33:03,878 --> 01:33:05,709
Take it off,

697
01:33:41,049 --> 01:33:42,243
Go on,

698
01:35:03,264 --> 01:35:05,255
Keep the brush away from that,

699
01:35:36,164 --> 01:35:38,564
Let's go back to shaving,

700
01:37:09,557 --> 01:37:11,115
You girls go on to bed,

701
01:37:11,292 --> 01:37:13,988
- Daddy, come on,
- No,

702
01:37:20,201 --> 01:37:21,634
Why can't we see?

703
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:11,548
What are they?

704
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:16,054
Let's go make breakfast,

705
01:42:41,789 --> 01:42:42,949
I,,,

706
01:42:44,491 --> 01:42:46,322
,,, blew this up for you,

707
01:42:48,462 --> 01:42:50,794
Why did you want me to shave you?

708
01:42:59,974 --> 01:43:01,441
Why?

709
01:43:07,114 --> 01:43:09,412
So I could swim out further,

710
01:43:10,784 --> 01:43:12,809
Swim out?

711
01:43:13,654 --> 01:43:15,053
Yes,

712
01:43:24,465 --> 01:43:26,399
What are you saying?

713
01:43:29,069 --> 01:43:31,230
And I want you with me,

714
01:43:33,807 --> 01:43:36,640
- What?
- Diane,

715
01:43:38,112 --> 01:43:41,206
- Diane,
- What are you talking about?

716
01:43:44,518 --> 01:43:46,076
You want me to watch you die?

717
01:43:46,253 --> 01:43:48,551
I want you with me,

718
01:43:48,722 --> 01:43:50,212
That's all,

719
01:43:51,158 --> 01:43:53,319
But is this what you did?

720
01:43:54,228 --> 01:43:56,355
Made me fall in love with you
to watch you,,,?

721
01:43:56,530 --> 01:43:59,226
I don't see it that way at all,

722
01:44:02,002 --> 01:44:03,867
I love you,

723
01:44:44,945 --> 01:44:47,345
I never took your portrait,

724
01:52:05,285 --> 01:52:07,014

729
01:55:29,422 --> 01:55:30,446
Hi,

730
01:55:32,959 --> 01:55:33,983
Hi,

731
01:55:35,128 --> 01:55:36,618
You mind if I sit here?

732
01:55:36,796 --> 01:55:38,195
No,

733
01:55:45,739 --> 01:55:48,173
Are you gonna take my picture?

734
01:55:50,610 --> 01:55:52,077
No,

735
01:55:52,545 --> 01:55:54,103
Not yet,

736
01:55:59,552 --> 01:56:01,986
Why don't you tell me a secret?

737
01:56:02,656 --> 01:56:04,214
A secret?

738
01:56:04,391 --> 01:56:05,824
Yes,

739
01:56:08,161 --> 01:56:10,652
How about you tell me one first?

740
01:56:20,273 --> 01:56:21,865
Okay,
