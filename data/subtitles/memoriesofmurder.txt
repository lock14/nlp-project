1
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:13,125
Junk car! Junk Car!

2
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:33,178
Get out of here, kid.

3
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:51,998
I told you to get out of here.

4
00:03:16,226 --> 00:03:17,955
Go home, kid.

5
00:03:19,128 --> 00:03:20,925
Little brat.

6
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:25,329
What the hell are they doing?

7
00:03:25,734 --> 00:03:26,826
Hey you!

8
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:28,734
Put that back!

9
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:35,807
Hey, leave it there. Go away.

10
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,808
Hey you!

11
00:03:37,046 --> 00:03:40,713
That's important, don't touch!

12
00:03:42,383 --> 00:03:45,245
Those kids.

13
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:18,920
<b>MEMORIES OF MURDER</b>

14
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,256
What?

15
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:32,387
You dated the dead girl, and
she dumped you last August?

16
00:04:32,498 --> 00:04:33,430
Is that right?

17
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,265
That's correct.

18
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:40,135
That's correct? Take off
your hat, you damn punk.

19
00:04:42,275 --> 00:04:44,835
Do women like guys like you?

20
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:51,047
After watching Body Heat...

21
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:56,119
Body Heat?
That an action movie?

22
00:04:56,855 --> 00:04:59,289
A, c, t...

23
00:05:06,164 --> 00:05:07,995
Damn punk...

24
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:12,593
...since it's a rape
and murder case and all...

25
00:05:12,705 --> 00:05:15,936
well...

26
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:20,478
...if she was sexy,
or pretty, that sort of thing.

27
00:05:20,577 --> 00:05:22,067
Your impressions?

28
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,908
Well,

29
00:05:25,015 --> 00:05:28,382
she didn't seem
like a country girl...

30
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,682
Don't blink.

31
00:05:33,122 --> 00:05:34,419
You blinked, didn't you?

32
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:38,017
Hey, look at me.

33
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:41,696
Don't look at the ceiling,
look at me!

34
00:05:43,032 --> 00:05:46,195
Was he born that way?
One, two...

35
00:05:58,948 --> 00:06:02,111
Didn't you want to go
to the Military Academy?

36
00:06:02,217 --> 00:06:04,515
Did you take the exam?

37
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:07,520
You need to study hard
to get in there.

38
00:06:10,158 --> 00:06:13,059
- Receipt!
- You didn't ask for one.

39
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:16,255
What? I told you to bring one.

40
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:18,698
- I told you.
- No you didn't.

41
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,132
That's what you said last time...

42
00:06:21,236 --> 00:06:23,966
Here's one, here.

43
00:06:24,972 --> 00:06:29,409
You answered the phone,
you lying bastard...

44
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:34,414
I need a receipt from the restaurant.
Not from a bicycle shop.

45
00:06:45,226 --> 00:06:47,353
Why didn't you rope
the place off?

46
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,055
At least get some sticks
to drive them in, morons.

47
00:06:51,165 --> 00:06:53,292
Inspector Park, over here!

48
00:06:54,901 --> 00:06:56,994
- What is this?
- It's a footprint.

49
00:06:57,337 --> 00:07:00,431
- When did you find it?
- This morning, sir!

50
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,736
Go help those jerks over there.

51
00:07:02,842 --> 00:07:04,901
You called the forensics team?

52
00:07:05,011 --> 00:07:07,172
Yes, they're on their way.

53
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:11,978
But, where's the
person who reported this?

54
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:17,349
No forensics team,
this is total chaos!

55
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:19,390
Jesus, look at him!

56
00:07:21,194 --> 00:07:21,922
Hey!

57
00:07:22,362 --> 00:07:23,386
Get out of here!

58
00:07:27,366 --> 00:07:28,731
Who received the call on this?

59
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:30,433
Did you find out
who reported it?

60
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:33,131
The phone... The crime
site is getting ruined.

61
00:07:33,238 --> 00:07:36,605
Damn forensics team's
not here, this is a mess.

62
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,074
What are you talking about?

63
00:07:39,178 --> 00:07:43,376
Take pictures when I tell you!

64
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,578
Why'd you bring
so many reporters?

65
00:07:46,685 --> 00:07:49,916
They were all here when I arrived.

66
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:53,081
Reporter Park's not here.
Must be on vacation.

67
00:07:53,192 --> 00:07:54,682
I don't see him.

68
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:56,259
Feels great with
that shithead gone.

69
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,761
Why does this have
to happen to me?

70
00:07:59,864 --> 00:08:02,424
How can I investigate like this?

71
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:06,902
Hey, tractor!

72
00:08:07,004 --> 00:08:09,472
Tractor!

73
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:14,534
Tractor, stay away! Detour!

74
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:19,916
If someone waves,
shouldn't you look?

75
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:22,814
Shit, is he deaf?

76
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,479
Shit! Look at this.

77
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,683
Now those bastards show up.

78
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:34,756
What the hell took you so long?

79
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:37,766
The crime scene's ruined!

80
00:08:37,868 --> 00:08:41,804
Jesus, look at these sliding fools!

81
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:43,804
What's going on?

82
00:08:50,045 --> 00:08:53,879
How can you look at
those photos while eating?

83
00:08:55,552 --> 00:08:58,350
If I keep staring at them,

84
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,821
one moment it'll hit me.

85
00:09:00,923 --> 00:09:02,015
Instinctively.

86
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,489
Are you a fortune teller?

87
00:09:04,025 --> 00:09:05,686
Open up a shop then.

88
00:09:06,595 --> 00:09:12,830
Chief, I may know nothing else,
but my eyes can read people.

89
00:09:13,234 --> 00:09:14,997
It's how I survive as a detective.

90
00:09:15,103 --> 00:09:20,302
There's a reason people
say I have shaman's eyes.

91
00:09:20,408 --> 00:09:22,569
OK, then.

92
00:09:22,844 --> 00:09:25,244
You see those two guys there?

93
00:09:27,314 --> 00:09:32,616
One of them's a rapist, and the
other is the victim's brother.

94
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:41,155
He caught the guy doing this to
his sister, and dragged him in.

95
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:49,128
So tell me,
which one's the rapist?

96
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,174
- Hey.
- What?

97
00:10:03,282 --> 00:10:04,647
I think it fell out.

98
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,149
Really?

99
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:08,345
Let's do this properly.

100
00:10:13,327 --> 00:10:16,455
I'll give this to you
especially today.

101
00:10:16,562 --> 00:10:18,587
I'm so grateful.

102
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:22,895
It's just a flu shot.

103
00:10:23,002 --> 00:10:24,629
Know how much this costs?

104
00:10:27,572 --> 00:10:29,938
- Kwak Sul-young?
- Yeah?

105
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:34,808
You must be earning more
now than at the hospital.

106
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:39,778
I hear everyone in
town comes to you.

107
00:10:39,883 --> 00:10:42,977
Shh. I got something to tell you.

108
00:10:43,088 --> 00:10:46,524
I heard this from the
old woman at the mill.

109
00:10:46,858 --> 00:10:50,555
You know the Baek family
meat restaurant?

110
00:10:51,261 --> 00:10:52,489
The Baek family?

111
00:10:53,031 --> 00:10:56,489
You know what people call them?

112
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:57,891
What?

113
00:10:59,069 --> 00:11:02,004
The Baek Lady Killers.

114
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,297
- Ladies?
- Yeah.

115
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:10,711
But the son's a little
bit retarded. Kwang-ho.

116
00:11:11,914 --> 00:11:16,783
Kwang-ho used to follow
Hyang-sook around all the time.

117
00:11:16,887 --> 00:11:19,856
Hyang-sook?
The one who was killed?

118
00:11:19,956 --> 00:11:21,480
Yeah.

119
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:26,961
She was found with
a girdle over her head?

120
00:11:27,064 --> 00:11:28,258
Right.

121
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:31,457
Even more important,

122
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:34,536
the night she was killed...

123
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:39,369
that old woman saw
Kwang-ho following her.

124
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,544
- Really?
- That's what I'm saying.

125
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:47,138
I heard that old hag
went senile last year.

126
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,877
No, she's fine.

127
00:11:54,056 --> 00:11:57,719
That kid... Wait.

128
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:01,028
Kwang-ho? What's he look like?

129
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:06,858
This side of his face is a bit...
you know.

130
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:10,198
Tell me in detail.

131
00:12:10,304 --> 00:12:12,772
Anyways, he's a poor little kid.

132
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:38,196
Kwang-ho.

133
00:12:39,568 --> 00:12:41,695
Let's talk man to man.

134
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:45,670
You see a pretty girl,
you want to do her.

135
00:12:45,772 --> 00:12:51,506
When I was your age, I'd go
out with friends, I understand.

136
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:57,675
You never intended to kill
Hyang-sook at first, huh?

137
00:12:57,783 --> 00:13:00,684
"How about just
touching her breast..."

138
00:13:00,787 --> 00:13:01,776
I couldn't touch it.

139
00:13:01,888 --> 00:13:04,755
So you killed her?
Kill her, then you can touch it.

140
00:13:04,857 --> 00:13:06,324
No, I didn't.

141
00:13:10,194 --> 00:13:13,721
That guy coming down now,
he's had a hard life, like you.

142
00:13:13,832 --> 00:13:15,857
He's nice.

143
00:13:15,968 --> 00:13:18,368
He's really sweet.

144
00:13:18,469 --> 00:13:20,767
He never beats anyone.

145
00:13:20,872 --> 00:13:23,739
But sometimes,
you know,

146
00:13:23,842 --> 00:13:27,073
if he gets worked up
about something...

147
00:13:30,748 --> 00:13:34,707
God, what an ugly face.

148
00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:39,756
Just looking at this face
makes me angry.

149
00:13:41,491 --> 00:13:42,958
Shit.

150
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,431
Pretty?

151
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,808
This is so it won't
leave scratches, you punk.

152
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,207
Hey, hey...

153
00:14:01,545 --> 00:14:03,911
What's with the army boots?

154
00:14:04,013 --> 00:14:06,038
Doing this to the kid...

155
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:08,310
Kwang-ho, get up.

156
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,786
Are you really innocent? Huh?

157
00:14:15,892 --> 00:14:17,291
Look in my eyes.

158
00:14:19,895 --> 00:14:21,419
Where the hell's he looking?

159
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,191
Look in my eyes!

160
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:03,694
Excuse me, miss...

161
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:05,636
Hello?

162
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:08,741
Oh, miss?

163
00:15:09,345 --> 00:15:10,607
Are you all right?

164
00:15:11,546 --> 00:15:12,808
Why are you following me?

165
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:16,042
To ask directions.

166
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,242
Let me help you.

167
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,818
Let go!

168
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,185
What's wrong?

169
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:28,489
Rolling in the fields, huh?
Is this town rapist's paradise?

170
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,327
You shithead.

171
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:38,394
What the hell?

172
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,870
Who are you?

173
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,339
Get over here.

174
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:47,237
Hey miss, the victim
needs to file a report!

175
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:50,672
Miss!

176
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,758
Where is she going?

177
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,226
Are you a detective?

178
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:10,566
You should have told me.

179
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:11,828
My mistake.

180
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:16,173
How can a detective
be such a bad fighter?

181
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:23,037
How can a detective have
such a bad eye for criminals?

182
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,116
What's that smell?

183
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,944
Oh, sneakers.

184
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:32,415
They smell bad?

185
00:16:32,522 --> 00:16:37,221
But these here are
evidence item #28.

186
00:17:02,684 --> 00:17:04,242
Develop these quickly, huh?

187
00:17:07,323 --> 00:17:09,689
- Uh, chief.
- What?

188
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:11,350
This guy here... from Seoul.

189
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:16,056
Nice to meet you!
I got the call...

190
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:17,860
But...

191
00:17:17,966 --> 00:17:20,059
your face...

192
00:17:20,168 --> 00:17:23,103
Did anything happen?

193
00:17:23,205 --> 00:17:25,105
- No, nothing.
- A desk, you need...

194
00:17:25,206 --> 00:17:28,903
Oh, I prepared a desk
over there with lots of sunlight.

195
00:17:29,678 --> 00:17:32,977
I think... I like that corner.

196
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:38,013
Okay, okay! As you wish.

197
00:17:40,288 --> 00:17:42,813
Inspector Jo, say hello.

198
00:17:43,891 --> 00:17:45,950
From Seoul,

199
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,824
Suh Tae...yoon, senior officer.

200
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:51,124
Jo Yong-gu. Nice to meet you.

201
00:17:51,532 --> 00:17:55,400
He volunteered to assist
with this investigation.

202
00:17:55,802 --> 00:17:57,292
Quite an uncommon thing.

203
00:17:57,404 --> 00:18:00,840
Well, go arrange your desk.

204
00:18:00,941 --> 00:18:02,340
Yes, sit down.

205
00:18:02,442 --> 00:18:05,343
Inspector Chief

206
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:21,026
The song is great.
The opening song.

207
00:18:21,628 --> 00:18:23,823
I always watch
Inspector Chief with Dad.

208
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,057
What was my phone number?

209
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:28,366
Just eat.

210
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:30,560
Right, I need to call Dad!

211
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:34,071
I should call. Oh, it's Dad!

212
00:18:43,682 --> 00:18:45,149
Hey, Kwang-ho.

213
00:18:47,452 --> 00:18:48,976
Listen.

214
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:53,115
This footprint was found at the
site of Hyang-sook's murder.

215
00:18:53,226 --> 00:18:54,250
Look.

216
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,822
And these are sneakers
we found at your house.

217
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,898
You wear these? Right?

218
00:19:00,998 --> 00:19:02,727
Now, look closely.

219
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:08,636
The footprint in this photo,
and the sole of your shoe.

220
00:19:08,906 --> 00:19:10,567
The same, right?

221
00:19:10,674 --> 00:19:12,767
This pattern?

222
00:19:12,877 --> 00:19:18,213
The circle, this indentation?
Exactly the same.

223
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:20,044
Am I right?

224
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,218
This part was smudged,

225
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,254
don't worry about that.

226
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:32,892
You killed all
those women, right?

227
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:33,962
Okay.

228
00:19:35,332 --> 00:19:37,766
You didn't kill them all, right?

229
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:45,370
So you didn't not kill only
Hyang-sook, correct?

230
00:19:47,244 --> 00:19:48,575
I didn't kill anyone.

231
00:19:48,677 --> 00:19:52,477
We've got the
evidence here!

232
00:19:52,581 --> 00:19:56,142
- Where's our shovel?
- Shovel?

233
00:19:58,154 --> 00:20:01,055
Look at you...

234
00:20:02,191 --> 00:20:05,683
Hey, bastard. Give me that.

235
00:20:05,794 --> 00:20:08,820
Can't you even shovel right?
Watch me.

236
00:20:08,932 --> 00:20:12,163
Loosen the dirt first.
Then push with your foot.

237
00:20:12,268 --> 00:20:14,099
- Kwang-ho!
- Yes?

238
00:20:14,202 --> 00:20:18,138
You punk.

239
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:22,198
Did you come here to play?

240
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,743
You know where this is?

241
00:20:24,012 --> 00:20:25,502
We came here to bury you.

242
00:20:25,612 --> 00:20:29,571
What? Why?
Why?

243
00:20:29,684 --> 00:20:31,948
Because you won't
listen, you bastard.

244
00:20:32,053 --> 00:20:35,318
- I'm a good boy.
- Then tell me!

245
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:39,420
Out here in the fresh air.
With that face.

246
00:20:39,527 --> 00:20:41,188
Hey, come here.

247
00:20:41,295 --> 00:20:45,129
Women hate this
face, don't they?

248
00:20:45,232 --> 00:20:47,632
They grimace and all
fucking run away.

249
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:49,394
It's true.

250
00:20:49,503 --> 00:20:51,300
I'll kill them all.

251
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:58,203
Everyone who
grimaces at my face.

252
00:20:58,311 --> 00:21:00,176
I'll kill them all.

253
00:21:01,949 --> 00:21:06,682
Those women who grimace,
they're all in my head.

254
00:21:08,654 --> 00:21:11,248
- Hyang-sook too?
- Hyang-sook?

255
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:14,224
Hyang-sook. You always
followed her around.

256
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:17,728
- Hyang-sook is pretty.
- Oh yeah, she's pretty.

257
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:21,027
But Hyang-sook
grimaced too, huh?

258
00:21:21,134 --> 00:21:22,965
She said, "Fuck, get away!"
Didn't she?

259
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,834
Because you liked her.

260
00:21:25,938 --> 00:21:27,565
So you killed her, huh?

261
00:21:36,147 --> 00:21:38,012
By the train tracks.

262
00:21:38,116 --> 00:21:39,845
In that rice paddy.

263
00:21:39,951 --> 00:21:42,511
The train tracks? Right.

264
00:21:42,621 --> 00:21:46,318
Her throat. Hyang-sook's throat...

265
00:21:46,424 --> 00:21:49,916
...strangled it tightly.

266
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:52,461
- With what?
- Her brassiere.

267
00:21:52,564 --> 00:21:56,125
With her white brassiere,

268
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:59,760
strangled her tightly.

269
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,497
- And then?
- Her stocking.

270
00:22:01,605 --> 00:22:04,472
- Her stocking?
- Pulled off her leg.

271
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:06,008
Then it was the stocking.

272
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:09,568
This guy's smart, huh?

273
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,738
And then?

274
00:22:10,847 --> 00:22:12,747
What?

275
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:15,818
What was it?

276
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,547
Something with a strap?

277
00:22:18,955 --> 00:22:20,354
A handbag strap?

278
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:21,753
Right, a bag strap.

279
00:22:21,858 --> 00:22:30,197
Strangling Hyang-sook's
throat with it tightly.

280
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,624
And?

281
00:22:33,036 --> 00:22:39,407
Then, Hyang-sook's
body shook a bit.

282
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,740
She looked completely dead.

283
00:22:42,645 --> 00:22:44,044
And then?

284
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,274
Her head was covered up.

285
00:22:50,385 --> 00:22:51,716
With what?

286
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:59,750
Her panties. Covered her
head with her panties.

287
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:03,296
Do you mean a girdle?
That women wear?

288
00:23:03,397 --> 00:23:05,456
Right, girdle!

289
00:23:05,566 --> 00:23:10,902
Looked like it covered
her head right up.

290
00:23:11,505 --> 00:23:12,938
And then?

291
00:23:13,874 --> 00:23:16,934
Um... had to dress her again.

292
00:23:17,044 --> 00:23:18,944
And why was that?

293
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,778
I don't know.
Put the clothes back on.

294
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:24,748
Why was that?

295
00:23:29,757 --> 00:23:31,554
How would I know?

296
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:33,217
You were doing well!

297
00:23:33,326 --> 00:23:35,590
Bastard! What did you do next?

298
00:23:35,695 --> 00:23:37,060
- Then... running!
- Where?

299
00:23:37,163 --> 00:23:39,097
- It was raining!
- Where did you run?

300
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,159
- Kept running.
- Oh, you little shit!

301
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:45,703
The lightning struck!

302
00:23:45,805 --> 00:23:48,205
Where the hell were you
running, you bastard!

303
00:23:48,308 --> 00:23:50,970
Yong-gu, start digging.

304
00:23:51,078 --> 00:23:52,705
Huh? Digging?

305
00:23:52,813 --> 00:23:54,405
Lightning!

306
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:19,367
Citizens, this is a
civil defence drill.

307
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,337
The air raid siren
has begun to sound.

308
00:24:22,441 --> 00:24:24,875
This is only a drill.

309
00:24:24,977 --> 00:24:29,505
The entire country is now
under a civil defence drill.

310
00:24:29,614 --> 00:24:37,316
A blackout is called for
in all buildings and houses.

311
00:24:37,422 --> 00:24:42,155
Follow the instructions
you hear in this broadcast.

312
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:48,596
Please move all flammable
materials to a safe place.

313
00:24:48,698 --> 00:24:53,965
Unplug all cords, then hurry
to an underground area...

314
00:25:01,846 --> 00:25:04,508
Shut off the lights!

315
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,855
Hey, you!

316
00:25:22,965 --> 00:25:24,865
Come here.

317
00:25:27,336 --> 00:25:29,236
Put this on.
Everyone ready?

318
00:25:29,338 --> 00:25:31,932
Get in the car.

319
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:33,633
Turn around.

320
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:36,141
"Lee Hyang-sook"

321
00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:38,406
Take off your pants.

322
00:25:40,615 --> 00:25:41,673
What'll the headline be?

323
00:25:41,783 --> 00:25:45,241
"Crime-Fighting Trio" or
"Smiles of the Unstoppable."

324
00:25:45,353 --> 00:25:47,378
Inspector Park, in the back.

325
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,425
Make a straight line now.

326
00:25:51,326 --> 00:25:54,625
Miss Kwon, big party tonight!
Reserve a room.

327
00:25:54,729 --> 00:25:56,094
Smile!

328
00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:00,523
This time, hold up your fist.
Tight!

329
00:26:01,636 --> 00:26:05,572
- Come take a picture!
- That's okay.

330
00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:07,503
Come on!

331
00:26:12,145 --> 00:26:13,806
Wait a second.

332
00:26:22,223 --> 00:26:24,157
With these webbed fingers,

333
00:26:24,259 --> 00:26:27,524
you can't even hold
chopsticks, right?

334
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:30,620
They've always been this way?
Go on.

335
00:26:39,171 --> 00:26:41,799
Kwang-ho, this is the spot, right?

336
00:26:41,908 --> 00:26:42,840
I don't know.

337
00:26:42,942 --> 00:26:45,638
What's he talking about?
It was here.

338
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:50,105
For the re-enactment,
you have to act well.

339
00:26:50,215 --> 00:26:53,048
There are a lot of reporters here.

340
00:26:53,152 --> 00:26:55,120
How's this?

341
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,744
A bit lower.

342
00:26:57,055 --> 00:26:59,353
- What do we start with?
- Wait.

343
00:26:59,457 --> 00:27:04,622
It's best to write down
the correct order.

344
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:07,323
Then why didn't you do it?
I'm fucking busy.

345
00:27:07,699 --> 00:27:08,631
Chief.

346
00:27:09,534 --> 00:27:13,561
The re-enactment
isn't going to work anyway.

347
00:27:13,672 --> 00:27:16,732
Becomes an embarrassment.

348
00:27:16,841 --> 00:27:21,505
Hey, I told you to stay away.
Why'd you come back here?

349
00:27:21,612 --> 00:27:24,604
Just give them some excuse.
The suspect is sick, or...

350
00:27:24,716 --> 00:27:26,183
Inspector Suh!

351
00:27:27,017 --> 00:27:30,282
You're dumping shit
on cooked rice here!

352
00:27:30,388 --> 00:27:33,516
I told you before,
Kwang-ho isn't guilty.

353
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:35,092
Just shut up!

354
00:27:35,427 --> 00:27:36,826
Chief...

355
00:27:36,928 --> 00:27:41,365
The cords around their necks
were tied with three tight knots.

356
00:27:41,465 --> 00:27:44,730
Look at Kwang-ho's hands.
Could he do that?

357
00:27:44,835 --> 00:27:46,666
- Get out!
- Even a child can see that.

358
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,431
Get the hell out!

359
00:27:51,307 --> 00:27:52,103
Grab the brassiere strap...

360
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:53,732
Hey, concentrate!

361
00:27:53,843 --> 00:27:56,209
Dad!

362
00:27:56,312 --> 00:27:57,574
Kwang-ho! It's me!

363
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,308
Dad!

364
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:04,182
Hey, you're innocent!

365
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,056
I know! I didn't do it!

366
00:28:16,866 --> 00:28:24,705
Mr. Baek Kwang-ho!
Are you denying a crime?

367
00:28:24,806 --> 00:28:28,003
He didn't kill anyone!
My son's innocent!

368
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:33,514
You were tortured, weren't you?

369
00:28:33,614 --> 00:28:34,774
My team never tortures suspects.

370
00:28:37,452 --> 00:28:39,249
It's all gone to hell.

371
00:28:39,354 --> 00:28:41,754
Don't bring it up.

372
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:47,726
Hey, did you see the look on
prosecutor Choi's face back there?

373
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:51,196
Fuck, how can he
revoke the warrant?

374
00:28:51,466 --> 00:28:52,865
We even had evidence.

375
00:28:52,968 --> 00:28:55,994
Evidence? That footprint?

376
00:28:58,173 --> 00:29:00,539
How can they set him free?

377
00:29:00,641 --> 00:29:03,041
What can we do?

378
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:06,340
All we had was a confession.

379
00:29:06,446 --> 00:29:10,405
It was no ordinary confession.
You heard the tape.

380
00:29:10,517 --> 00:29:15,580
All the details of the crime
came pouring out his mouth.

381
00:29:15,689 --> 00:29:19,819
Things he'd never know
if he weren't the killer.

382
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:22,554
Like how she was strangled.

383
00:29:22,996 --> 00:29:25,430
You heard it too.

384
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:28,694
Be honest, didn't you
rehearse that in advance?

385
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:29,893
What?

386
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:31,970
Quiet. Eat something.

387
00:29:32,072 --> 00:29:34,006
Jesus...

388
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:43,615
What? I said to separate
the noodles and bean sauce.

389
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:46,884
What the fuck!

390
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:52,082
Investigative Team Reshuffled

391
00:29:52,191 --> 00:29:56,855
Murder Case Shrouded
In Mystery Once Again

392
00:30:14,645 --> 00:30:18,604
The location of
the first homicide,

393
00:30:18,715 --> 00:30:20,808
and the second homicide.

394
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:25,377
Now, a distance of...

395
00:30:25,489 --> 00:30:26,888
approximately 1000 meters.

396
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:30,585
A length of not more
than... one kilometer.

397
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:44,239
The victim, on the
12th and the 16th,

398
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:49,039
both days at twelve o'clock...

399
00:30:49,145 --> 00:30:52,581
Ah, December 16th.

400
00:30:52,681 --> 00:30:54,512
On December 16th,

401
00:30:54,617 --> 00:30:57,211
at twelve o'clock,

402
00:30:57,787 --> 00:31:01,484
Location: Yangji Teahouse,

403
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:04,457
Han Sung-geun

404
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,154
a 32-year old office worker.

405
00:31:08,931 --> 00:31:13,300
An arranged date, maybe?

406
00:31:13,402 --> 00:31:17,736
Anyway, at the crime site

407
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,402
...were found a footprint,
two drops of blood,

408
00:31:22,511 --> 00:31:26,777
...and a drop of semen.
Semen? They found semen?

409
00:31:26,881 --> 00:31:28,872
What? Yes.

410
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,547
The two dead women...

411
00:31:34,655 --> 00:31:36,987
Did they have
anything in common?

412
00:31:39,127 --> 00:31:40,685
In common...

413
00:31:40,794 --> 00:31:42,659
Well, first...

414
00:31:42,763 --> 00:31:46,790
Both of them were single.

415
00:31:47,967 --> 00:31:51,266
They were both
extremely beautiful.

416
00:31:51,371 --> 00:31:52,599
And?

417
00:31:54,675 --> 00:31:57,644
The murders all
took place in the rain.

418
00:31:57,743 --> 00:31:59,005
Rain?

419
00:31:59,646 --> 00:32:01,807
He murdered them
on rainy nights.

420
00:32:02,849 --> 00:32:04,248
Really?

421
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:06,413
And red clothes.

422
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:09,249
They all wore red clothes.

423
00:32:09,355 --> 00:32:11,380
Both of them?

424
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:14,254
No, all three of them.

425
00:32:14,727 --> 00:32:16,524
Three of them?

426
00:32:16,629 --> 00:32:18,096
What are you talking about?

427
00:32:18,196 --> 00:32:21,859
Three were murdered.
We just haven't found the third body.

428
00:32:26,005 --> 00:32:29,304
This is a missing person form.
The name is quite unusual.

429
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:33,435
Dokko Hyun-soon, age 27.
It was two months ago, July 18.

430
00:32:33,546 --> 00:32:37,573
Oh, her? Dokko Hyun-soon?
I know that girl.

431
00:32:37,683 --> 00:32:41,119
Everyone in this town knows her.

432
00:32:41,219 --> 00:32:44,086
A pretty girl,
that Hyun-soon.

433
00:32:44,189 --> 00:32:47,716
Even a Miss Korea
is no match for her.

434
00:32:47,992 --> 00:32:51,189
Did you process the missing
person form, Yong-gu?

435
00:32:51,295 --> 00:32:52,728
Oh, shut up.

436
00:32:52,831 --> 00:32:55,994
This is no ordinary incident, Chief.

437
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,934
If you look in detail.
Documents never lie.

438
00:33:00,037 --> 00:33:04,064
It says she was
wearing a red shirt.

439
00:33:04,174 --> 00:33:06,039
It's right here in writing.

440
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:07,570
What's that?

441
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:12,075
Marked here is the weather
on the day she vanished.

442
00:33:12,181 --> 00:33:14,479
It rained on that day too.

443
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:18,882
Rain, red clothes...

444
00:33:18,988 --> 00:33:21,821
She was murdered.
By the same person.

445
00:33:21,925 --> 00:33:25,622
You don't know this town,
that's why you talk nonsense.

446
00:33:25,728 --> 00:33:30,062
She always said she'd
go to Seoul one day...

447
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:32,430
I have an idea where the body is.

448
00:33:32,535 --> 00:33:33,968
Look at the map.

449
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:38,001
Right here...

450
00:33:38,107 --> 00:33:41,565
I marked where the victim went,
and where the body might be.

451
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:47,944
Give me two squadrons of
cops. I'll find her in two days.

452
00:33:50,954 --> 00:33:52,251
You sure of this?

453
00:34:12,173 --> 00:34:13,299
You know...

454
00:34:13,407 --> 00:34:17,241
...university students,
when they go on orientation...

455
00:34:17,345 --> 00:34:20,143
people say they
guys all get laid,

456
00:34:20,247 --> 00:34:25,241
a big group, guys and girls,
in one room going at it...

457
00:34:25,352 --> 00:34:27,149
Is that true?

458
00:34:27,253 --> 00:34:29,778
I don't know. Hurry up.

459
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:34,561
You went to a 2-year
school, didn't you?

460
00:34:34,661 --> 00:34:39,121
Student trips, orientation...
Did you go on those?

461
00:34:40,967 --> 00:34:44,926
Go ask Suh, he went
to a 4-year university.

462
00:34:45,038 --> 00:34:46,699
Whether he had group sex...

463
00:34:47,273 --> 00:34:50,071
Shit, four years.

464
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:53,035
I spent 4 years in high school.

465
00:34:56,716 --> 00:34:59,276
Shit, put that away.

466
00:35:03,289 --> 00:35:06,258
You know, I miss
Dokko Hyun-soon.

467
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:07,326
You too?

468
00:35:08,294 --> 00:35:12,230
She was just
too good for this town.

469
00:35:13,566 --> 00:35:16,558
I'm telling you, she
went to Seoul.

470
00:35:18,136 --> 00:35:20,536
What is it?

471
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:22,301
Lot of snakes down there.

472
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,946
Each part of a corpse
decays at a different speed.

473
00:35:31,049 --> 00:35:33,074
Look. It's old,

474
00:35:33,184 --> 00:35:36,210
but the inner thigh is still firm.

475
00:35:37,155 --> 00:35:38,952
There's evidence of rape?

476
00:35:39,357 --> 00:35:41,086
A bit of semen was found.

477
00:35:42,426 --> 00:35:45,827
But it's so old, we can't
determine the blood type.

478
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,262
Oh, Hyun-soon...

479
00:35:48,698 --> 00:35:52,794
This time too he used
items belonging to her.

480
00:35:52,903 --> 00:35:55,997
Right, that's her stocking
around the throat?

481
00:35:56,106 --> 00:35:57,266
Yes.

482
00:35:57,574 --> 00:36:00,509
The victim's panties
on her face,

483
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,737
as with Hyang-sook.

484
00:36:02,846 --> 00:36:05,246
Her hands were bound
the same way too.

485
00:36:05,348 --> 00:36:10,081
His methods of killing
are quite professional.

486
00:36:10,454 --> 00:36:12,422
He's thorough.

487
00:36:12,522 --> 00:36:14,217
And polished.

488
00:36:16,461 --> 00:36:22,229
So there hasn't been
a single witness yet.

489
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,336
Would you like
a bit more tenderloin?

490
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:29,871
That's okay. We're fine.

491
00:36:29,972 --> 00:36:33,373
Where did Kwang-ho go?
I don't see him.

492
00:36:33,475 --> 00:36:36,410
Is anything...?

493
00:36:36,512 --> 00:36:40,949
I bought your son something,
give it to him later.

494
00:36:41,049 --> 00:36:42,607
What's this?

495
00:36:42,717 --> 00:36:46,517
Oh, last time, taking a
look at his sneakers,

496
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:49,853
they smelled so awful,
I felt bad for him.

497
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:53,689
I thought, I'll have to buy
him new shoes.

498
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,592
So I picked up some Nikes.

499
00:36:55,696 --> 00:36:57,994
You didn't have to...

500
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:02,166
That punk, he's always sleeping
in the strangest places!

501
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:06,701
Kwang-ho!

502
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:11,039
This here...
your shoe size is 250mm, right?

503
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,841
Here, Nike. Try them on.

504
00:37:16,049 --> 00:37:18,210
Give me that sneaker.

505
00:37:18,317 --> 00:37:22,447
These are "Nice", not Nike.
N, I, C, E.

506
00:37:22,556 --> 00:37:25,957
Nice or Nike. Who cares?

507
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:32,225
If you buy him sneakers,
you should get the real thing.

508
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,301
Cool, huh?

509
00:37:39,206 --> 00:37:40,195
Have a drink.

510
00:37:41,475 --> 00:37:43,943
I beat you because
I care for you.

511
00:37:44,044 --> 00:37:47,980
So if you see me on the
street, don't run away.

512
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,846
Yong-gu feels bad about...

513
00:37:53,753 --> 00:37:54,720
Punk.

514
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:03,225
Hey, where are you going again?

515
00:38:04,029 --> 00:38:06,259
You see, Chief.

516
00:38:06,364 --> 00:38:11,063
That boy is the exact opposite
of the type we're looking for.

517
00:38:11,168 --> 00:38:15,332
Dragging in suspects like that
is a waste of time, so...

518
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,270
Inspector Suh!

519
00:38:17,475 --> 00:38:20,706
Have some meat
before you speak.

520
00:38:25,516 --> 00:38:27,575
I don't eat burnt meat.

521
00:38:31,922 --> 00:38:34,948
"You said you'd come back to me"

522
00:38:35,025 --> 00:38:41,328
"Like the singing swallows"

523
00:38:42,466 --> 00:38:48,632
"On the hills, singing birds
and blooming flowers"

524
00:38:48,706 --> 00:38:54,440
"Alone on the hill"

525
00:38:58,515 --> 00:38:59,311
Sir?

526
00:39:08,658 --> 00:39:10,182
Hey, Seoul city bumpkin.

527
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:14,490
What?

528
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,298
Why did you come here?

529
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,496
Out to the boondocks?

530
00:39:23,872 --> 00:39:25,396
To catch the killer.

531
00:39:30,912 --> 00:39:32,846
Is Seoul that big?

532
00:39:34,048 --> 00:39:35,379
Huh? Is it big?

533
00:39:37,786 --> 00:39:39,253
Bigger than America?

534
00:39:41,555 --> 00:39:44,388
Give me a banana.

535
00:39:47,896 --> 00:39:50,865
Let me tell you about America.

536
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,728
They've got the F.B.I.!

537
00:39:55,636 --> 00:39:58,935
If you watch how they
investigate... You know how?

538
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:04,611
Their heads are
spinning like a top.

539
00:40:05,313 --> 00:40:07,804
Analyzing things...

540
00:40:07,915 --> 00:40:10,008
You know why?

541
00:40:11,185 --> 00:40:14,677
It's 'cause they got so
much fucking land!

542
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:22,287
If you don't use your brain,
it's too much ground to cover.

543
00:40:22,395 --> 00:40:27,230
So they have no choice,
those F.B.I. Bastards.

544
00:40:27,766 --> 00:40:32,169
But our Republic of Korea...

545
00:40:32,672 --> 00:40:38,008
using just your two legs,
you can run all over it.

546
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,543
You know why?

547
00:40:40,879 --> 00:40:43,939
'Cause our land's
the size of my dick.

548
00:40:44,049 --> 00:40:49,954
So it's said, Korean detectives
investigate with their feet.

549
00:40:50,054 --> 00:40:54,150
That's folk wisdom,
you bastard.

550
00:40:54,259 --> 00:40:57,820
So brainy geeks like you
can go the hell to America.

551
00:40:57,929 --> 00:41:01,558
- Go there and...
- Shut your fucking mouth!

552
00:41:04,435 --> 00:41:06,733
You bastard!

553
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,369
- Let go of me!
- What? You f...

554
00:41:18,683 --> 00:41:19,650
Give him this.

555
00:41:24,056 --> 00:41:26,422
Take it away! Take it!

556
00:41:34,498 --> 00:41:37,899
Everything's clearer now.
That's much better.

557
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:45,331
I've got it now.
About the killer.

558
00:41:45,442 --> 00:41:48,036
That bastard,

559
00:41:48,144 --> 00:41:51,113
he'll do it again.

560
00:41:51,213 --> 00:41:53,841
The next night it rains.

561
00:41:53,949 --> 00:41:58,716
So we need to keep
one step ahead of him.

562
00:41:58,821 --> 00:42:02,086
Pre-emptive!
Okay?

563
00:42:03,892 --> 00:42:08,454
And if you two ever start
fighting in front of me again,

564
00:42:08,564 --> 00:42:12,056
I'll kill you both! Understood?

565
00:42:28,017 --> 00:42:28,949
Ladies and gentlemen!

566
00:42:29,051 --> 00:42:30,040
In just a moment,

567
00:42:30,152 --> 00:42:32,245
our President will be

568
00:42:32,354 --> 00:42:34,914
driving past. Wait a minute...

569
00:42:54,475 --> 00:42:56,534
It's raining nice.

570
00:42:58,211 --> 00:42:59,473
You ready?

571
00:43:35,414 --> 00:43:39,350
Ooh, Gui-ok's looking nice!

572
00:43:39,452 --> 00:43:40,441
Shut up.

573
00:43:43,122 --> 00:43:46,216
What if he grabs her for real?

574
00:43:46,325 --> 00:43:52,286
Inspector Suh should be
following close behind her.

575
00:43:52,398 --> 00:43:58,860
Shit, do we have to do
this every time when it rains?

576
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:01,198
But thanks to this,

577
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,705
Gui-ok puts on that red skirt.

578
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:07,675
With makeup, she looks
like a different person.

579
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,674
- So what?
- Was she always that pretty?

580
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,906
You getting hard?

581
00:44:11,014 --> 00:44:12,982
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Let's check.

582
00:44:13,082 --> 00:44:15,312
- We're on duty now...
- Oh, Yong-gu!

583
00:44:23,993 --> 00:44:25,290
Hey.

584
00:44:26,362 --> 00:44:28,125
So do you really
keep watch here?

585
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:32,433
These days, nobody
ever goes outside.

586
00:44:34,603 --> 00:44:35,865
Someone's coming.

587
00:44:37,373 --> 00:44:39,773
Hey, kids!

588
00:44:41,443 --> 00:44:42,307
Over here.

589
00:44:46,082 --> 00:44:47,379
That's cold.

590
00:44:47,483 --> 00:44:48,814
You're so wet!

591
00:44:51,988 --> 00:44:55,924
Hey, stay here
until the rain stops.

592
00:44:56,392 --> 00:44:58,019
That umbrella's useless.

593
00:44:58,127 --> 00:45:00,095
And we just picked it up
in front of the school.

594
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:02,721
Someone threw it away.

595
00:45:03,966 --> 00:45:05,524
Miss, are you going
that way too?

596
00:45:05,634 --> 00:45:07,295
Hey, she's a detective.

597
00:45:07,403 --> 00:45:09,166
No way!

598
00:45:09,272 --> 00:45:11,570
She's in the
Violent Crimes Division.

599
00:45:11,673 --> 00:45:13,641
- Really?
- Sure.

600
00:45:13,742 --> 00:45:16,108
Wait a minute.
We'll give you a ride.

601
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,405
Wow, in a police car!

602
00:45:18,512 --> 00:45:23,506
Hey, you two. What are
you doing out so late?

603
00:45:23,618 --> 00:45:25,813
We always stay together,
so it's okay.

604
00:45:25,919 --> 00:45:29,548
You'll be fine
even if you go alone.

605
00:45:31,993 --> 00:45:36,191
Nam-ju, tell them about
what you heard at school.

606
00:45:36,296 --> 00:45:37,320
What?

607
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:39,990
You know, during cleaning
time, about the murderer.

608
00:45:40,101 --> 00:45:44,197
Right! You know why they
can't catch the murderer?

609
00:45:44,304 --> 00:45:47,296
This is the truth. We go to
Ansong Girls Middle School.

610
00:45:47,407 --> 00:45:49,238
Behind our school,
there's an outhouse.

611
00:45:49,342 --> 00:45:53,369
They say a crazy man lives
under there, the murderer!

612
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,913
He stays there all day,

613
00:45:55,015 --> 00:45:58,075
and when night comes,
he sneaks out and kills women.

614
00:45:58,183 --> 00:46:01,880
So when he comes out at night,

615
00:46:01,988 --> 00:46:05,446
you must be able to smell
the shit from miles away.

616
00:46:05,558 --> 00:46:08,618
That's not the story.

617
00:46:08,728 --> 00:46:12,164
Yoo-jin said a crazy woman
fell in there and died.

618
00:46:12,432 --> 00:46:16,664
Then I'll meet you in front of
the factory with an umbrella.

619
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:20,365
It's okay.

620
00:46:20,472 --> 00:46:21,996
Okay.

621
00:46:22,108 --> 00:46:25,737
I'll see you soon.

622
00:46:35,186 --> 00:46:42,285
Don't leave me.

623
00:46:42,392 --> 00:46:48,388
"I still love you.
Walking by myself..."

624
00:48:41,975 --> 00:48:42,964
Hello?

625
00:48:46,046 --> 00:48:48,981
Everyone stay where you are!

626
00:48:49,081 --> 00:48:53,711
Don't touch anything near you.
Don't move one step!

627
00:48:54,321 --> 00:48:55,345
Hey, you!

628
00:48:55,455 --> 00:48:56,683
I'm talking to you!

629
00:48:56,789 --> 00:48:59,189
Wait for the forensics team.

630
00:49:11,436 --> 00:49:12,994
Look!

631
00:49:13,104 --> 00:49:15,572
These are genuine footprints.

632
00:49:16,641 --> 00:49:20,202
You see the
Remicon factory there?

633
00:49:20,311 --> 00:49:24,304
He caught her near the factory,

634
00:49:24,416 --> 00:49:28,477
and quietly pulled her
over 400 meters to here.

635
00:49:30,688 --> 00:49:34,715
The footprints look
like a bride and groom's.

636
00:49:35,759 --> 00:49:42,164
But you didn't find anything,
aside from the footprints?

637
00:49:42,265 --> 00:49:46,668
I hoped to find fingerprints on
the umbrella, but no luck.

638
00:49:47,572 --> 00:49:50,097
Not only that, due to the rain,

639
00:49:50,207 --> 00:49:52,437
the footprints are all smudged.

640
00:49:54,279 --> 00:49:58,181
Even after such a thorough
investigation, nothing.

641
00:50:01,218 --> 00:50:05,951
Therefore, Chief, I think
this could be a hint. Hint!

642
00:50:06,056 --> 00:50:07,580
What?

643
00:50:07,691 --> 00:50:12,719
The fact that we found
nothing at the scene.

644
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:16,491
Always in rape cases,

645
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:19,329
at the crime scene,

646
00:50:19,434 --> 00:50:24,064
there's one or two of
those hairs left behind.

647
00:50:24,172 --> 00:50:25,696
So?

648
00:50:25,974 --> 00:50:31,935
I'm saying the criminal must not
have any hair down there.

649
00:50:32,047 --> 00:50:33,810
You mean hairless?

650
00:50:33,915 --> 00:50:38,249
That's right, hairless.
A total baldie.

651
00:50:39,855 --> 00:50:45,293
He can't leave hair behind,
because he doesn't have any?

652
00:50:45,393 --> 00:50:47,020
For example,

653
00:50:47,128 --> 00:50:51,258
a Buddhist monk who
shaved the hair down there.

654
00:50:51,365 --> 00:50:53,333
It's a perfect crime.

655
00:50:53,434 --> 00:50:55,425
Well, then.

656
00:50:55,536 --> 00:50:59,438
Yongdeok Temple
is just next door.

657
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:01,064
Should we start there?

658
00:51:08,784 --> 00:51:12,686
Hey Gui-ok, you've got
the radio on over there.

659
00:51:15,089 --> 00:51:17,353
How would you like your coffee?

660
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:19,483
Lots of sugar for me.

661
00:51:20,127 --> 00:51:22,755
- Inspector Suh!
- Yes, sir?

662
00:51:22,863 --> 00:51:26,629
Do you have any more ideas?

663
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,664
I don't know.
As you saw today,

664
00:51:29,769 --> 00:51:32,169
this criminal is flawless.

665
00:51:32,272 --> 00:51:34,206
- So?
- Therefore,

666
00:51:34,306 --> 00:51:37,867
our standard procedures
aren't going to help.

667
00:51:37,977 --> 00:51:40,912
So what are we going to do?

668
00:51:44,683 --> 00:51:47,516
Excuse me, but I've
got something to show you.

669
00:51:50,989 --> 00:51:53,719
What will she show us today?

670
00:51:56,661 --> 00:51:57,650
What's this?

671
00:51:58,363 --> 00:52:01,298
These are documents
from an FM radio station.

672
00:52:01,399 --> 00:52:04,300
Looks like a
broadcast schedule.

673
00:52:04,402 --> 00:52:08,805
Yes, it's an evening music
program I listen to.

674
00:52:08,906 --> 00:52:14,071
There's someone who keeps
requesting the song, "Sad Letter".

675
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,381
If you look, it lists the dates
this song was broadcast.

676
00:52:18,316 --> 00:52:22,650
Actually, this isn't a very
popular song. It's quite rare.

677
00:52:22,754 --> 00:52:24,312
A song? What letter?

678
00:52:24,423 --> 00:52:28,086
"Sad Letter"
The singer is Yu Jae-ha.

679
00:52:29,394 --> 00:52:30,759
Jo Young-pil's band.

680
00:52:30,862 --> 00:52:33,330
- Sure, I heard it.
- So?

681
00:52:35,433 --> 00:52:41,065
The song was broadcast on the
same days of the murders here.

682
00:52:43,607 --> 00:52:44,574
Look.

683
00:52:45,609 --> 00:52:48,237
October 20.
That's Park Bo-hee's murder.

684
00:52:48,811 --> 00:52:53,942
December 19
was Lee Hyang-sook.

685
00:52:54,383 --> 00:52:55,509
So...

686
00:52:55,619 --> 00:52:59,988
...on last night's murder too,
this song was broadcast?

687
00:53:00,089 --> 00:53:03,718
Yes. I listened to it myself.

688
00:53:04,092 --> 00:53:08,358
Containing the request.

689
00:53:08,464 --> 00:53:12,059
"Sent by a lonely man
from Terung District."

690
00:53:12,167 --> 00:53:14,397
"Please broadcast it
on a rainy day."

691
00:53:18,107 --> 00:53:20,871
Miss Kwon, nice! Good idea!

692
00:53:21,709 --> 00:53:24,542
You read too many mystery
novels as a student?

693
00:53:25,213 --> 00:53:27,647
That was a nice story.

694
00:53:28,918 --> 00:53:32,012
Chief, this can't
be a coincidence.

695
00:53:32,121 --> 00:53:33,986
Look at this.
Documents never lie.

696
00:53:34,089 --> 00:53:36,990
Christ, here we go again.

697
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:40,926
It seems he's a real psycho.

698
00:53:41,029 --> 00:53:44,931
As soon as he hears the song,
he goes crazy.

699
00:53:45,033 --> 00:53:48,332
Oh Chief, now you're doing
it too. This makes no sense!

700
00:53:48,436 --> 00:53:51,098
It does make sense, sir!
It's quite simple.

701
00:53:51,206 --> 00:53:55,802
Assemblies start with the
National Anthem. It's the same.

702
00:53:55,909 --> 00:53:57,570
Did you get the postcard?

703
00:53:57,678 --> 00:54:00,408
I requested it,

704
00:54:00,514 --> 00:54:03,142
but the radio station's
a bit disorganized.

705
00:54:05,351 --> 00:54:08,286
Find it quickly.
Check the postmark,

706
00:54:08,387 --> 00:54:09,752
fingerprints and handwriting.

707
00:54:09,857 --> 00:54:10,915
Yes, sir!

708
00:54:11,324 --> 00:54:15,124
Officer Kwon, call the station
and follow up on this.

709
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,194
Baldies!

710
00:54:22,935 --> 00:54:25,369
- What about that?
- Huh?

711
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:27,564
What we mentioned before...

712
00:54:27,672 --> 00:54:29,435
Hairless, sir!

713
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:31,372
How do you investigate?

714
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:34,503
Pull the pants off passing men?

715
00:54:47,093 --> 00:54:51,757
The postcard from yesterday.
I asked you to keep it!

716
00:54:51,863 --> 00:54:53,660
What postcard?

717
00:54:53,766 --> 00:54:58,100
You read it on the air yesterday!
Look how many we get here!

718
00:55:00,372 --> 00:55:01,464
Hey, mister!

719
00:55:02,909 --> 00:55:04,774
Nothing. Get dressed.

720
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:08,176
Inspector.

721
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,647
They've already
carted off yesterday's trash.

722
00:55:11,749 --> 00:55:13,910
It's no use.

723
00:55:28,464 --> 00:55:30,625
You're not going to shower?

724
00:55:32,902 --> 00:55:36,133
Enough showers, for god's sake.

725
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:40,005
My skin feels like it'll burst.

726
00:55:40,643 --> 00:55:42,907
You couldn't find
any hairless men?

727
00:55:45,682 --> 00:55:49,709
Like looking for dog's horns.
Just paid sauna fees.

728
00:55:49,818 --> 00:55:52,184
Shit, can't even get reimbursed.

729
00:55:52,621 --> 00:55:55,055
At least your face is clean.

730
00:55:58,161 --> 00:56:01,324
How many times in a day...
dressing, undressing, dressing...

731
00:56:01,431 --> 00:56:02,989
I'll lose my hair there too.

732
00:56:09,005 --> 00:56:11,735
I asked the workers
at the sauna there,

733
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,899
to call me if they saw anyone,

734
00:56:14,009 --> 00:56:19,641
Bastards just smirked at me.

735
00:56:21,216 --> 00:56:25,175
Don't do it all yourself,
have someone else do it.

736
00:56:28,357 --> 00:56:32,225
What's that guy from Seoul
doing these days?

737
00:56:34,561 --> 00:56:37,894
- Researching pop songs.
- What?

738
00:56:39,233 --> 00:56:41,360
Shit, it's nothing
you've heard of.

739
00:56:41,735 --> 00:56:44,067
Is he still talking nonsense?

740
00:56:45,372 --> 00:56:47,499
Driving me crazy.

741
00:56:48,341 --> 00:56:53,074
If you feel that way,
go see a shaman.

742
00:56:53,546 --> 00:56:54,478
A shaman?

743
00:56:55,215 --> 00:56:58,707
Sure, one that
tells fortunes well.

744
00:56:59,285 --> 00:57:03,449
Ask her where the
murderer is hiding.

745
00:57:11,263 --> 00:57:13,561
A problem at the main gate
of the police station.

746
00:57:14,301 --> 00:57:18,863
It should be moved about
10m to the southwest.

747
00:57:21,007 --> 00:57:25,603
A face just passed by me.
I think he's the one.

748
00:57:32,619 --> 00:57:36,680
Is his face among
these pictures here?

749
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:40,319
Take those dirty photos away.

750
00:57:41,092 --> 00:57:43,560
- Hey, just look...
- Put them away!

751
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:47,125
It's bad fortune.

752
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:55,328
- Take this, and do what I say.
- Don't try to sell that charm.

753
00:58:14,191 --> 00:58:16,659
Wait, wait a minute.

754
00:58:20,229 --> 00:58:23,392
You have to mix in dirt
from the crime scene.

755
00:58:24,233 --> 00:58:25,222
Stir.

756
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:28,728
She said that
was most important.

757
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:30,965
Now pour it.

758
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,307
Stop.

759
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:40,980
Good.

760
00:58:48,724 --> 00:58:50,658
Once this dries,

761
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:55,788
this stain will form the
shape of the murderer's face.

762
00:58:55,898 --> 00:58:57,593
That's ridiculous.

763
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,759
Quiet, you'll break the charm.

764
00:58:59,868 --> 00:59:01,495
Know how much this costs?

765
00:59:02,203 --> 00:59:03,898
So shut up!

766
00:59:10,712 --> 00:59:11,804
Who's that?

767
00:59:14,381 --> 00:59:15,678
Don't you know?

768
00:59:16,183 --> 00:59:18,743
Criminals always return
to the crime scene.

769
00:59:53,053 --> 00:59:54,281
Wait a sec.

770
00:59:58,224 --> 00:59:59,987
What's he doing here?

771
01:00:00,092 --> 01:00:01,787
Why'd he come?

772
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:20,503
What the fuck...

773
01:00:20,611 --> 01:00:25,514
We need science here!

774
01:00:25,851 --> 01:00:27,375
What the hell's that?

775
01:00:34,458 --> 01:00:36,323
Still, he's got style.

776
01:03:04,635 --> 01:03:05,624
Stop there!

777
01:03:07,604 --> 01:03:08,593
Hey, you!

778
01:03:30,694 --> 01:03:32,025
It's getting narrow!

779
01:03:32,129 --> 01:03:33,494
Single file!

780
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:00,716
Miss, did a strange man
just run past here?

781
01:04:00,822 --> 01:04:03,620
No.

782
01:04:03,724 --> 01:04:06,158
- It's that policeman.
- What?

783
01:04:06,261 --> 01:04:09,196
- At the guard post.
- You know him?

784
01:04:09,898 --> 01:04:13,766
Damn, he's a
fast little bastard.

785
01:04:15,202 --> 01:04:16,601
He's not there?

786
01:04:20,641 --> 01:04:23,804
Did you check the
alleys properly?

787
01:04:23,911 --> 01:04:25,970
You think you
know this village?

788
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:28,607
You stepped on a
stick back there.

789
01:04:28,716 --> 01:04:31,207
A stick or a shit pile, who cares?

790
01:04:31,318 --> 01:04:33,309
He stepped on it.

791
01:04:40,027 --> 01:04:41,654
What?

792
01:04:42,095 --> 01:04:43,756
Over there... Hey, you!

793
01:04:54,907 --> 01:04:58,242
Stop!

794
01:05:03,648 --> 01:05:06,742
Jesus, not again.

795
01:05:08,386 --> 01:05:10,377
Hey, over there.

796
01:05:38,148 --> 01:05:40,810
Black clothes, black clothes...

797
01:05:41,317 --> 01:05:43,285
Everyone's in black except you.

798
01:05:54,832 --> 01:05:56,595
Everybody stop!

799
01:05:59,969 --> 01:06:02,199
Don't move an inch!

800
01:06:26,195 --> 01:06:27,958
- Inspector Jo!
- Yes?

801
01:06:29,931 --> 01:06:30,920
Gather them together.

802
01:06:34,468 --> 01:06:36,095
Hey, stop.

803
01:06:36,204 --> 01:06:38,035
Gather together.

804
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,264
Lift up your heads.

805
01:06:41,174 --> 01:06:42,471
Everyone stand in line.

806
01:06:59,526 --> 01:07:02,927
Look in my eyes.

807
01:07:04,597 --> 01:07:05,791
Give me that.

808
01:07:18,446 --> 01:07:20,539
What is it?

809
01:07:23,483 --> 01:07:24,916
You bastard!

810
01:07:25,018 --> 01:07:27,043
- Give me your hands!
- What are you doing?

811
01:07:27,152 --> 01:07:31,521
You ran away from us?

812
01:07:53,645 --> 01:07:55,237
But...

813
01:07:55,347 --> 01:07:59,147
Is jerking off a crime?

814
01:07:59,249 --> 01:08:01,581
It's not a crime.

815
01:08:01,686 --> 01:08:04,086
Why'd you run away?

816
01:08:04,188 --> 01:08:08,181
Someone jumped out
of the woods and ran at me,

817
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:10,283
so I panicked.

818
01:08:10,395 --> 01:08:14,889
Sure, but why'd you go
all the way out there to do it?

819
01:08:14,999 --> 01:08:18,457
There are kids at home,

820
01:08:18,569 --> 01:08:22,061
and the air's nice in the woods.

821
01:08:22,173 --> 01:08:26,735
Or did you go back to
fantasize about the dead girls?

822
01:08:27,945 --> 01:08:34,111
Your husband likes
to go out at night, huh?

823
01:08:36,754 --> 01:08:37,914
What's this?

824
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:39,921
Gimme that.

825
01:08:44,294 --> 01:08:46,057
What did you make these with?

826
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:04,370
These days, you know,

827
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:10,247
real events in our town are
stronger than the magazines.

828
01:09:10,352 --> 01:09:13,150
When I read the newspaper,

829
01:09:13,254 --> 01:09:15,552
I start fantasizing.

830
01:09:15,657 --> 01:09:17,784
I ask myself why I do this,

831
01:09:17,893 --> 01:09:24,457
but when will this
chance come again?

832
01:09:24,565 --> 01:09:27,090
According to neighbors,

833
01:09:27,201 --> 01:09:29,999
he looks diligently
after his sick wife,

834
01:09:30,104 --> 01:09:32,197
never misses a week at church,

835
01:09:32,306 --> 01:09:35,207
that he's honest.

836
01:09:36,645 --> 01:09:38,738
All perverts are like that.

837
01:09:38,847 --> 01:09:40,815
Nice on the outside.

838
01:09:40,916 --> 01:09:43,908
But my eyes can't be fooled.

839
01:09:44,018 --> 01:09:45,849
One look, and I know.

840
01:09:49,724 --> 01:09:50,554
Honey,

841
01:09:50,658 --> 01:09:53,593
I put socks in here.
Change them after dinner.

842
01:09:53,694 --> 01:09:55,252
Don't forget, or they'll smell.

843
01:09:55,362 --> 01:09:58,354
I'll take care of it.
Go feed the kids.

844
01:09:59,266 --> 01:10:01,325
Watch out for protesters.

845
01:10:03,437 --> 01:10:06,964
Release Jo Byung-soon!

846
01:10:07,073 --> 01:10:07,835
What now?

847
01:10:07,942 --> 01:10:09,967
I heard Byung-soon
confessed last night.

848
01:10:10,077 --> 01:10:11,339
Who says so?

849
01:10:11,444 --> 01:10:13,639
Oh, Chief!

850
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:19,684
When will you make
an announcement?

851
01:10:19,785 --> 01:10:22,845
We know nothing.
Just wait a bit more.

852
01:10:22,955 --> 01:10:25,515
You've held him 4 days
without a warrant.

853
01:10:25,624 --> 01:10:28,491
People are saying he's
detained illegally.

854
01:10:28,761 --> 01:10:33,789
This time be realistic,
like in a movie.

855
01:10:34,866 --> 01:10:35,855
Go!

856
01:10:36,901 --> 01:10:38,596
You did a good job just now.

857
01:10:38,703 --> 01:10:39,727
Yong-ku?

858
01:10:44,041 --> 01:10:47,943
So, you were hiding
behind the outhouse,

859
01:10:48,045 --> 01:10:49,672
and you saw
Park Myung-ja

860
01:10:49,782 --> 01:10:53,445
coming towards you
with a flashlight, right?

861
01:10:53,552 --> 01:10:57,283
Yes, yes, yes. It seems so.

862
01:10:58,723 --> 01:11:01,283
Not it seems,
you bastard, be precise!

863
01:11:07,231 --> 01:11:08,755
I think I dreamed it that way.

864
01:11:09,467 --> 01:11:14,427
Anyway, I snuck up behind her,

865
01:11:14,539 --> 01:11:22,810
and I must have chopped
the back of her neck?

866
01:11:22,914 --> 01:11:24,745
With my hand like this.

867
01:11:24,849 --> 01:11:25,747
Next?

868
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:31,715
Myung-ja cried out, and I
guess she collapsed?

869
01:11:31,821 --> 01:11:38,522
So I laid her on the ground,
and was about to take her,

870
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:41,892
Hey, it didn't
happen there, it was...

871
01:11:41,996 --> 01:11:47,059
The pine grove!
I took her there.

872
01:11:47,169 --> 01:11:49,899
It was from the rice paddies
to the pine grove.

873
01:11:50,004 --> 01:11:53,940
According to the news, more
than 200 meters, right?

874
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:55,670
That's so far!

875
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:59,976
So the rain was pouring, and I
dragged her through the mud.

876
01:12:00,081 --> 01:12:01,480
And then?

877
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:05,314
So I threw her down
in the pine grove.

878
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:07,946
Then I strangled her.

879
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:10,389
- With what?
- The bag strap.

880
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:11,925
Really?

881
01:12:12,026 --> 01:12:13,994
Her stocking!

882
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:17,996
Right.

883
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:21,866
Brassiere. A Venus brassiere.

884
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:29,376
I wrapped it around
her throat like this,

885
01:12:29,477 --> 01:12:31,172
So the woman,

886
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:36,512
she took a rock and
clocked me in the head.

887
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:38,245
Where'd she hit you?

888
01:12:38,353 --> 01:12:43,188
Right here, next to my eye.

889
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:48,057
It still hurts, even if
it was just a dream.

890
01:12:59,238 --> 01:13:03,572
Byung-soon, are you gonna
keep saying it was a dream?

891
01:13:03,676 --> 01:13:06,372
That's enough.
Turn your head.

892
01:13:08,547 --> 01:13:10,208
So this bruise is from the rock?

893
01:13:10,316 --> 01:13:12,876
- No, this guy here...
- Shut up! Look here.

894
01:13:17,155 --> 01:13:21,489
You've done well,
now let's finish this.

895
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:25,497
So...

896
01:13:25,598 --> 01:13:29,159
Since she hit me
like this with the rock,

897
01:13:29,267 --> 01:13:31,997
I must have lost consciousness?

898
01:13:32,104 --> 01:13:37,406
And after lying there a while,
I woke up, and looking around...

899
01:13:37,509 --> 01:13:38,806
And?

900
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:43,904
I was in the bottom
of an outhouse! A shithouse!

901
01:13:44,015 --> 01:13:48,452
And maggots were
creeping all over the place!

902
01:13:48,553 --> 01:13:52,148
Not the outhouse again.
So after brushing them off,

903
01:13:52,257 --> 01:13:56,694
I grabbed some straw,
and pulled myself up.

904
01:13:56,794 --> 01:13:59,991
Even in a dream, it's hard.

905
01:14:00,096 --> 01:14:01,757
But then I saw,

906
01:14:01,865 --> 01:14:06,564
this wasn't someone's home,
it was a school toilet.

907
01:14:06,669 --> 01:14:09,160
Walking to the playground,

908
01:14:09,272 --> 01:14:12,867
I saw huge swarms of girls,

909
01:14:12,976 --> 01:14:16,810
so many, and the smell...

910
01:14:16,913 --> 01:14:18,141
Wait! Over here.

911
01:14:21,483 --> 01:14:24,418
Where did you hear about
that school outhouse?

912
01:14:25,421 --> 01:14:28,857
Everyone knows that story.

913
01:14:28,957 --> 01:14:31,585
I saw it in a dream.

914
01:14:33,029 --> 01:14:37,398
From below the gas attack,
run in a direction...

915
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,934
...perpendicular to the wind.

916
01:14:40,036 --> 01:14:42,300
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

917
01:14:42,838 --> 01:14:44,533
Put it down. Hey!

918
01:14:55,284 --> 01:14:56,182
Pretend you're dead!

919
01:15:00,322 --> 01:15:04,520
Last time, who told you that
story about the outhouse?

920
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:06,456
You came because of that?

921
01:15:11,832 --> 01:15:12,560
What's wrong?

922
01:15:12,666 --> 01:15:14,793
I hurt myself in the chute.

923
01:15:14,902 --> 01:15:16,870
There was a pebble in there.

924
01:15:18,672 --> 01:15:20,640
Where's the nurse?

925
01:15:22,342 --> 01:15:23,604
I'll put it on for you.

926
01:15:24,544 --> 01:15:25,841
I'll do it.

927
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:29,172
Shy? You're just a kid.

928
01:15:29,282 --> 01:15:30,180
Sit down.

929
01:15:35,087 --> 01:15:35,883
Give it to me.

930
01:15:38,758 --> 01:15:40,123
Lift up your shirt.

931
01:15:41,127 --> 01:15:44,893
Think about what I asked you.

932
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:51,896
The murderer in the outhouse,
coming out at night...

933
01:15:52,005 --> 01:15:55,771
Who might have
told that story first...

934
01:15:55,875 --> 01:15:57,206
How would I know?

935
01:15:57,309 --> 01:16:04,181
It's like asking who
made up the elephant jokes.

936
01:16:04,283 --> 01:16:07,081
Why don't you go to
the outhouse yourself?

937
01:16:07,586 --> 01:16:10,384
Do I look like
I have time for that?

938
01:17:01,404 --> 01:17:03,133
Even still...

939
01:17:03,241 --> 01:17:06,301
Some kids talk, so you
snoop around the outhouse?

940
01:17:06,409 --> 01:17:07,774
You got that much time?

941
01:17:08,378 --> 01:17:09,572
Giving me a heart attack.

942
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:11,010
Investigating...

943
01:17:11,114 --> 01:17:14,982
Is investigating such a dirty job?

944
01:17:17,287 --> 01:17:21,519
Ah! Is that why they
made up the rumor?

945
01:17:22,992 --> 01:17:26,155
I saw her myself
once or twice.

946
01:17:26,263 --> 01:17:27,252
That woman.

947
01:17:27,363 --> 01:17:28,796
Who?

948
01:17:29,498 --> 01:17:30,760
A crying woman.

949
01:17:32,134 --> 01:17:33,226
When was it?

950
01:17:34,236 --> 01:17:37,967
I was in the outhouse then too,

951
01:17:38,073 --> 01:17:40,701
when I heard a woman crying.

952
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:43,574
When I came out,

953
01:17:43,678 --> 01:17:47,239
there was a woman
working on that hill,

954
01:17:47,348 --> 01:17:49,213
who kept crying.

955
01:17:50,984 --> 01:17:53,145
A woman was crying?

956
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:54,284
Yes.

957
01:17:55,455 --> 01:17:57,355
She kept crying on that hill.

958
01:17:58,559 --> 01:18:00,220
It just seemed strange.

959
01:18:20,581 --> 01:18:21,309
Hello?

960
01:18:24,518 --> 01:18:25,348
Excuse me.

961
01:18:28,155 --> 01:18:29,952
Are you the person
who lives here?

962
01:18:32,526 --> 01:18:33,493
Who are you?

963
01:18:35,761 --> 01:18:38,457
I'd like to ask something.
I heard that...

964
01:18:42,068 --> 01:18:43,057
Wait!

965
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:45,664
Look here.

966
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:48,766
- I'm a policeman.
- Really?

967
01:18:49,809 --> 01:18:53,472
You can't stay there.
Someone might see.

968
01:18:55,414 --> 01:18:56,847
There's no one here.

969
01:19:01,853 --> 01:19:02,785
Go, please.

970
01:19:03,588 --> 01:19:04,577
I beg you.

971
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:20,534
Be assured this will
remain a secret.

972
01:19:21,572 --> 01:19:24,905
As we're both women,

973
01:19:25,009 --> 01:19:28,672
tell me everything
comfortably and in detail.

974
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:34,315
That night,

975
01:19:40,157 --> 01:19:42,489
a light rain was falling.

976
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:44,586
When was it?

977
01:19:47,197 --> 01:19:48,755
It was...

978
01:19:53,037 --> 01:19:54,470
last September.

979
01:20:04,547 --> 01:20:08,711
I had read all the articles...

980
01:20:08,818 --> 01:20:11,013
...about the women killed.

981
01:20:13,890 --> 01:20:18,452
The methods he used
were exactly the same.

982
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:26,024
It was the same with me.

983
01:20:32,273 --> 01:20:33,706
You saw his face?

984
01:20:34,507 --> 01:20:37,101
I tried not to on purpose,

985
01:20:37,211 --> 01:20:39,304
keeping my chin down.

986
01:20:41,248 --> 01:20:42,806
My panties covered my head,

987
01:20:44,018 --> 01:20:45,952
but I closed my eyes tight.

988
01:20:47,589 --> 01:20:50,888
If I saw him,
he'd have killed me.

989
01:20:53,894 --> 01:20:57,853
I don't know about the rest,
but one thing I remember.

990
01:20:58,833 --> 01:21:00,801
His hands were very soft.

991
01:21:01,969 --> 01:21:04,301
The hand over my mouth,

992
01:21:04,404 --> 01:21:06,736
was delicate,

993
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,171
just like a woman's.

994
01:21:42,206 --> 01:21:45,232
We're done. Let's get
ourselves some sleep.

995
01:21:46,144 --> 01:21:48,476
Once we get
your seal, it's done.

996
01:21:50,081 --> 01:21:51,981
It's all as you said.

997
01:21:53,317 --> 01:21:54,545
Sound good?

998
01:21:55,686 --> 01:21:57,847
Yes, of course.

999
01:21:58,756 --> 01:22:01,190
Oh, it's finally over, right?

1000
01:22:01,527 --> 01:22:02,687
Please let me down. Please.

1001
01:22:09,534 --> 01:22:11,001
Let him go.
He's not the murderer.

1002
01:22:11,636 --> 01:22:12,432
What?

1003
01:22:13,704 --> 01:22:16,002
Byung-soon, are
you the murderer?

1004
01:22:16,107 --> 01:22:18,098
Yes, sir, yes...

1005
01:22:18,676 --> 01:22:20,405
Shut up.
No you're not.

1006
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:22,369
I think I am...

1007
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:23,777
Let him go!

1008
01:22:25,550 --> 01:22:28,075
Write down everything she said...

1009
01:22:28,185 --> 01:22:29,015
Hey!

1010
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:31,053
You toying with me?

1011
01:22:31,521 --> 01:22:33,182
Are you having fun?

1012
01:22:33,891 --> 01:22:36,291
I caught the murderer, OK?

1013
01:22:36,393 --> 01:22:38,623
What do you mean,
you caught him?

1014
01:22:42,765 --> 01:22:45,325
Did you hang him
from the ceiling?

1015
01:22:45,434 --> 01:22:47,129
Well, he kept lying, and...

1016
01:22:47,236 --> 01:22:50,000
Get hold of yourself.
Those journalists...

1017
01:22:50,104 --> 01:22:51,935
- Chief!
- Those goddamned bastards!

1018
01:22:57,612 --> 01:22:59,239
Stop!

1019
01:23:01,249 --> 01:23:02,147
Listen.

1020
01:23:05,253 --> 01:23:06,015
What is that?

1021
01:23:07,689 --> 01:23:10,180
- Is it live?
- It's being broadcast now?

1022
01:23:10,291 --> 01:23:11,690
Yes, it's live.

1023
01:23:21,302 --> 01:23:24,794
First, declare a
state of emergency.

1024
01:23:24,906 --> 01:23:28,205
And send me two
garrisons of men.

1025
01:23:28,643 --> 01:23:31,703
Because our
intelligence says so!

1026
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,481
Tonight. There'll
be a murder tonight.

1027
01:23:35,983 --> 01:23:38,383
Hello, I need to
speak to producer Im...

1028
01:23:39,153 --> 01:23:40,279
What? He quit?

1029
01:23:41,322 --> 01:23:42,619
Get me the A.D. Now.

1030
01:23:43,223 --> 01:23:47,057
The song that was just
played, "Sad Letter".

1031
01:23:47,395 --> 01:23:49,590
Read the name and
address of the requester.

1032
01:23:50,063 --> 01:23:51,860
You must have the postcard.

1033
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,194
What? Prank call?

1034
01:23:54,835 --> 01:23:57,668
It's the police, bastard!
Hello?

1035
01:23:58,105 --> 01:23:59,003
I'll go myself.

1036
01:23:59,806 --> 01:24:01,967
Are the garrisons coming?

1037
01:24:02,375 --> 01:24:04,468
They don't even have
one man available.

1038
01:24:05,977 --> 01:24:10,175
They went to suppress
a demonstration in Suwon city.

1039
01:24:42,647 --> 01:24:46,083
Name: Ahn Mi-seon, age 28.

1040
01:24:47,552 --> 01:24:53,184
Estimated time of death, last
night between 7:30 and 8:00.

1041
01:24:54,526 --> 01:25:00,431
When the two of you were
fighting like madmen. Right?

1042
01:25:03,168 --> 01:25:05,295
Wait a minute.

1043
01:25:06,604 --> 01:25:08,799
There's something
in the vagina.

1044
01:25:21,650 --> 01:25:23,982
Looks like a peach.

1045
01:25:51,046 --> 01:25:52,445
Nine pieces.

1046
01:25:59,755 --> 01:26:04,590
Do you see this kind of
thing in Seoul often?

1047
01:26:07,029 --> 01:26:08,929
Never.

1048
01:26:11,899 --> 01:26:13,389
You were right.

1049
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:16,197
What?

1050
01:26:17,072 --> 01:26:22,567
These guys were a waste
of time from the start.

1051
01:26:25,012 --> 01:26:26,036
Hey!

1052
01:26:26,981 --> 01:26:28,539
A call from the radio station.

1053
01:26:29,116 --> 01:26:31,880
I think she found the postcard.

1054
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:36,284
I've got the postcard.
It has an address.

1055
01:26:36,990 --> 01:26:38,389
Can you write it down?

1056
01:26:39,426 --> 01:26:41,451
Jinan 1-ri, Terung District

1057
01:26:41,561 --> 01:26:44,223
#32. Park Hyun-gyu.

1058
01:27:19,197 --> 01:27:19,959
Who are you?

1059
01:27:22,034 --> 01:27:25,094
We're policemen.
Where has Park Hyun-gyu gone?

1060
01:27:25,704 --> 01:27:29,970
He works at the
factory at this time.

1061
01:27:55,365 --> 01:27:56,127
Hey, Hyun-gyu.

1062
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,465
Park Hyun-gyu!

1063
01:28:01,170 --> 01:28:02,536
Park Hyun-gyu!

1064
01:28:31,534 --> 01:28:32,501
Show me your hands.

1065
01:28:42,377 --> 01:28:44,174
They're quite smooth.

1066
01:28:46,682 --> 01:28:48,877
How long have you
worked in the factory office?

1067
01:28:52,821 --> 01:28:54,413
From September last year.

1068
01:28:56,091 --> 01:29:00,551
A little before the first murder.

1069
01:29:04,697 --> 01:29:09,532
So after doing your military
service, you came to this town,

1070
01:29:09,636 --> 01:29:13,072
and the murders all
began taking place.

1071
01:29:13,172 --> 01:29:14,639
Right?

1072
01:29:16,108 --> 01:29:17,632
Park Hyun-gyu.

1073
01:29:18,679 --> 01:29:21,204
You sent this postcard
to the station.

1074
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:22,178
Yes.

1075
01:29:22,748 --> 01:29:24,648
You sent several others too.

1076
01:29:24,751 --> 01:29:25,615
Yes.

1077
01:29:26,819 --> 01:29:29,811
You asked it to be
played on rainy days.

1078
01:29:29,923 --> 01:29:30,651
Yes.

1079
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:37,121
"Sad Letter" You know that
each time this song played,

1080
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:39,460
a woman was murdered?

1081
01:29:42,301 --> 01:29:43,233
No.

1082
01:29:46,005 --> 01:29:48,269
Look at the broadcast records.

1083
01:29:51,244 --> 01:29:52,142
Okay.

1084
01:29:53,646 --> 01:29:57,980
The song played yesterday?
"Sad Letter".

1085
01:29:58,316 --> 01:29:59,044
Yes.

1086
01:29:59,385 --> 01:30:01,919
You listened to the program?
- Yes.

1087
01:30:02,121 --> 01:30:06,148
Your song played at 7:08, and
the program finished at 8pm.

1088
01:30:06,258 --> 01:30:07,657
- You listened to the end?
- Yes.

1089
01:30:07,759 --> 01:30:09,590
- Continuously?
- Yes.

1090
01:30:09,694 --> 01:30:12,561
- What was the final song?
- I don't know.

1091
01:30:12,664 --> 01:30:14,655
- It was yesterday!
- I don't remember.

1092
01:30:14,766 --> 01:30:16,393
Because you went out!

1093
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:17,592
I was home!

1094
01:30:17,701 --> 01:30:21,159
She was killed
between 7:30 and 8pm.

1095
01:30:21,272 --> 01:30:23,433
You weren't listening,
you went out!

1096
01:30:23,874 --> 01:30:24,704
Don't make me laugh.

1097
01:30:25,276 --> 01:30:28,541
You motherfucker.
Are you joking?

1098
01:30:28,645 --> 01:30:30,613
- Let go of him now!
- Hey!

1099
01:30:34,517 --> 01:30:35,506
Get back here!

1100
01:30:40,624 --> 01:30:46,324
Even kids in this town know
you torture innocent people.

1101
01:30:46,430 --> 01:30:47,954
Shut up, you!

1102
01:30:48,065 --> 01:30:49,089
Get back here!

1103
01:30:53,070 --> 01:30:54,662
Anyway, I won't be one of them.

1104
01:30:56,706 --> 01:30:58,139
Never.

1105
01:31:01,244 --> 01:31:03,576
Okay. Park Hyun-gyu.

1106
01:31:03,681 --> 01:31:08,141
You say you listened
at home to the end?

1107
01:31:08,885 --> 01:31:12,616
But you couldn't have
forgotten the last song.

1108
01:31:12,721 --> 01:31:16,748
Because the DJ introduced it

1109
01:31:16,859 --> 01:31:18,827
with some very striking words.

1110
01:31:19,461 --> 01:31:23,761
She mentioned you, and
the many postcards you sent.

1111
01:31:23,865 --> 01:31:28,165
If you heard it,
you couldn't have forgotten.

1112
01:31:28,270 --> 01:31:31,364
Tell me! If you really
listened to the end.

1113
01:31:32,673 --> 01:31:34,504
I don't remember.

1114
01:31:34,607 --> 01:31:36,165
You don't remember?

1115
01:31:37,178 --> 01:31:38,907
Should I explain it for you?

1116
01:31:42,882 --> 01:31:45,146
This is the recording of
yesterday's program.

1117
01:31:47,188 --> 01:31:50,680
Last night, you sat
listening to this song.

1118
01:31:51,892 --> 01:31:56,090
Outside the rain was
pelting down, you listened,

1119
01:31:58,265 --> 01:32:00,927
and soon you started
itching with excitement.

1120
01:32:01,936 --> 01:32:05,895
There's something you always
do when you hear this song.

1121
01:32:07,008 --> 01:32:12,412
You heard a TV program playing
in the room of your landlady,

1122
01:32:12,512 --> 01:32:17,415
you left the lights on in your
own room and crept outside.

1123
01:32:18,252 --> 01:32:24,020
And in the pitch dark,
you wandered here and there.

1124
01:32:24,124 --> 01:32:27,582
Who will it be today?

1125
01:32:28,728 --> 01:32:29,626
Right?

1126
01:32:31,664 --> 01:32:35,862
You hid in a reed field,
waiting for a woman to pass.

1127
01:32:36,101 --> 01:32:37,693
The rain drenching you.

1128
01:32:37,803 --> 01:32:40,431
But you find all this pleasurable.

1129
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:42,030
Stimulating, right?

1130
01:32:42,674 --> 01:32:45,939
So yesterday you stuffed
this in that woman's body!

1131
01:32:48,379 --> 01:32:52,406
You remember how
many pieces it was?

1132
01:32:52,517 --> 01:32:54,348
One piece,

1133
01:32:54,419 --> 01:32:55,181
two...

1134
01:32:55,286 --> 01:32:57,083
- Three pieces...
- Shut up!

1135
01:32:57,187 --> 01:32:58,711
Four, five...

1136
01:32:58,822 --> 01:32:59,982
six, seven, eight...

1137
01:33:00,090 --> 01:33:01,580
Shut the fuck up!

1138
01:33:03,194 --> 01:33:07,654
Yong-gu!

1139
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:11,830
I told you not to hit him.

1140
01:33:11,936 --> 01:33:15,463
Didn't I?

1141
01:33:15,940 --> 01:33:17,635
I warned you.

1142
01:33:17,742 --> 01:33:20,540
You know why
journalists snoop around here.

1143
01:33:20,977 --> 01:33:22,274
You stupid bastard.

1144
01:33:25,516 --> 01:33:30,010
Don't even think about coming
into the interrogation room again.

1145
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,592
I'm going crazy.

1146
01:33:49,172 --> 01:33:52,005
No eyewitnesses,

1147
01:33:52,108 --> 01:33:53,973
not one piece of evidence.

1148
01:33:55,479 --> 01:33:57,913
We need something, shit.

1149
01:33:58,714 --> 01:34:02,480
Shit, we don't need
any damn witnesses.

1150
01:34:02,584 --> 01:34:04,415
Just a confession will do.

1151
01:34:05,153 --> 01:34:08,281
Just need to beat that
bastard to an inch of his life.

1152
01:34:11,226 --> 01:34:12,853
You've changed.

1153
01:34:15,463 --> 01:34:20,491
Try it and, you'll be disgraced.
Like with Kwang-ho.

1154
01:34:24,339 --> 01:34:26,773
Retarded Kwang-ho...

1155
01:34:30,345 --> 01:34:32,836
I always wanted to ask you.

1156
01:34:33,414 --> 01:34:36,178
When you dragged
him up the mountain,

1157
01:34:36,284 --> 01:34:42,689
he talked about Hyang-sook's
death in so much detail.

1158
01:34:43,490 --> 01:34:44,354
So?

1159
01:34:45,092 --> 01:34:49,927
Did you really not rehearse
that dialogue with him?

1160
01:34:50,030 --> 01:34:52,897
I told you I didn't!

1161
01:34:53,901 --> 01:34:58,167
But how did he know the
way she was strangled...

1162
01:34:58,272 --> 01:34:59,500
That's my point!

1163
01:35:02,943 --> 01:35:06,037
The tape... Where's the tape
from the mountain?

1164
01:35:06,145 --> 01:35:08,079
Miss Kwon? Gui-ok.

1165
01:35:09,049 --> 01:35:12,917
Then, Hyang-sook's body shook a bit.

1166
01:35:13,019 --> 01:35:15,681
She looked completely dead.

1167
01:35:15,787 --> 01:35:17,721
Listen to how he speaks here.

1168
01:35:17,822 --> 01:35:22,725
Covered up Hyang-sook's head.

1169
01:35:22,827 --> 01:35:25,218
With what?
- Her panties.

1170
01:35:25,897 --> 01:35:30,493
Her head was covered
with her panties.

1171
01:35:30,602 --> 01:35:33,503
He's talking like
it was someone else.

1172
01:35:33,605 --> 01:35:34,833
And then?

1173
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:39,934
He's describing what he saw.

1174
01:35:42,814 --> 01:35:44,475
Kwang-ho is the witness.

1175
01:35:56,794 --> 01:35:57,886
Where did Kwang-ho go?

1176
01:35:59,496 --> 01:36:00,986
Kwang-ho...

1177
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:03,665
No, no. We came for a drink.

1178
01:36:04,301 --> 01:36:05,996
Some meat, please.

1179
01:36:08,272 --> 01:36:10,103
What are you doing here?

1180
01:36:19,216 --> 01:36:20,649
Control yourself, huh?

1181
01:36:21,884 --> 01:36:24,375
He's not in his room.
I'll check outside.

1182
01:36:25,256 --> 01:36:27,019
Try the game arcade.

1183
01:36:29,359 --> 01:36:31,190
How long have you been here?

1184
01:36:32,127 --> 01:36:36,223
Have you seen Kwang-ho?

1185
01:36:46,742 --> 01:36:49,677
It is now 23 months since
the incident first surfaced.

1186
01:36:49,778 --> 01:36:53,111
Before interrogating
Detective Moon...

1187
01:36:53,949 --> 01:36:56,816
They should cut off
all detective's dicks!

1188
01:36:56,918 --> 01:36:58,647
Nah, it's not worth it.

1189
01:36:58,754 --> 01:37:01,621
They are stupid bastards.

1190
01:37:01,723 --> 01:37:02,553
Be quiet.

1191
01:37:15,503 --> 01:37:18,404
The trial of detective Moon,
suspected of police torture

1192
01:37:18,507 --> 01:37:22,603
and sexual assault,
opened today.

1193
01:37:43,463 --> 01:37:45,590
You fucked your professor,
didn't you, bitch!

1194
01:37:45,698 --> 01:37:48,599
Your parents pay good money...

1195
01:37:51,637 --> 01:37:52,569
Hey, Yong-gu!

1196
01:38:27,271 --> 01:38:29,000
Kwang-ho!

1197
01:38:30,007 --> 01:38:33,499
Kwang-ho!
Don't run away!

1198
01:38:33,612 --> 01:38:34,601
Hey, Kwang-ho!

1199
01:38:35,413 --> 01:38:38,075
Kwang-ho!

1200
01:38:44,889 --> 01:38:46,982
Kwang-ho!

1201
01:38:48,793 --> 01:38:49,691
I'm sorry...

1202
01:38:49,793 --> 01:38:50,987
What's wrong with you?

1203
01:38:51,094 --> 01:38:53,221
We're not here to catch you.

1204
01:38:53,331 --> 01:38:54,559
Come down.

1205
01:38:55,833 --> 01:38:58,301
You're gonna kill me?

1206
01:38:58,402 --> 01:39:02,133
We'll forget that any of
that happened.

1207
01:39:02,239 --> 01:39:04,537
If a fight breaks out,
that can happen.

1208
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:06,972
It's okay,

1209
01:39:07,076 --> 01:39:08,771
just come down, huh?

1210
01:39:08,878 --> 01:39:11,278
If I do, you'll kill me?

1211
01:39:11,380 --> 01:39:12,608
I know it.

1212
01:39:12,715 --> 01:39:15,582
We won't kill you,
just come down.

1213
01:39:15,684 --> 01:39:19,051
Okay, just stay there for now.
We've something to ask you.

1214
01:39:19,156 --> 01:39:22,091
You...

1215
01:39:22,191 --> 01:39:23,488
You remember Hyang-sook?

1216
01:39:23,593 --> 01:39:26,187
The girl that died.

1217
01:39:26,296 --> 01:39:29,094
Hyang-sook is pretty.

1218
01:39:30,032 --> 01:39:33,001
That's right. You used
to follow after her.

1219
01:39:33,102 --> 01:39:35,730
But that night,

1220
01:39:35,838 --> 01:39:39,968
when it rained,
you saw her killed, huh?

1221
01:39:40,676 --> 01:39:43,440
That? I told you already.

1222
01:39:43,545 --> 01:39:47,743
In the forest.
I told you already...

1223
01:39:47,850 --> 01:39:51,752
You saw when Hyang-sook was
murdered, didn't you? Here?

1224
01:39:51,853 --> 01:39:54,185
Yeah, here.

1225
01:39:55,023 --> 01:39:58,015
The paddy next to
the train tracks.

1226
01:40:01,362 --> 01:40:02,761
That night,

1227
01:40:02,864 --> 01:40:05,924
did you see the killer's face?

1228
01:40:06,034 --> 01:40:08,696
- Yeah.
- Really?

1229
01:40:09,704 --> 01:40:11,365
Lightning, ka-rang!

1230
01:40:14,641 --> 01:40:17,872
I saw everything
from inside here.

1231
01:40:17,978 --> 01:40:22,039
So you saw his face?

1232
01:40:22,148 --> 01:40:23,877
Three times.

1233
01:40:25,218 --> 01:40:28,085
Do you remember him in detail?

1234
01:40:28,955 --> 01:40:30,320
He was handsome.

1235
01:40:31,457 --> 01:40:33,584
More than me.

1236
01:40:39,066 --> 01:40:41,364
Was this the face you saw?

1237
01:40:44,170 --> 01:40:45,432
Look at the picture.

1238
01:40:55,348 --> 01:40:57,782
You know how hot
that fire was?

1239
01:40:57,883 --> 01:40:59,714
Look at the photo!

1240
01:41:00,353 --> 01:41:02,412
It was so hot!

1241
01:41:02,522 --> 01:41:04,581
Snap out of it!

1242
01:41:05,023 --> 01:41:07,423
Here, look closely.

1243
01:41:07,526 --> 01:41:10,086
Hot hot hot hot!

1244
01:41:10,196 --> 01:41:12,289
Look at the photo!

1245
01:41:12,397 --> 01:41:14,160
Hey. Kwang-ho.

1246
01:41:14,266 --> 01:41:16,166
When I was young,

1247
01:41:16,268 --> 01:41:19,726
he threw me in the fire.
That man.

1248
01:41:19,837 --> 01:41:21,702
- Kwang-ho!
- You bastards!

1249
01:41:21,806 --> 01:41:22,830
What the hell!

1250
01:41:22,941 --> 01:41:26,934
Please forgive him.

1251
01:41:27,011 --> 01:41:32,574
What are you students doing?

1252
01:41:32,683 --> 01:41:34,207
We're police!

1253
01:41:34,318 --> 01:41:36,286
Bullshit!
Then we're the F.B.I.!

1254
01:41:51,634 --> 01:41:52,794
Hey, Kwang-ho!

1255
01:41:53,537 --> 01:41:55,801
We're looking for you.

1256
01:41:56,874 --> 01:41:57,670
Hey!

1257
01:41:58,575 --> 01:42:00,770
A train's coming!
Come here!

1258
01:42:07,250 --> 01:42:08,945
Out of the way, quick!

1259
01:42:10,353 --> 01:42:11,718
It's dangerous there.

1260
01:42:12,154 --> 01:42:14,622
Out of the way! You idiot!

1261
01:42:14,724 --> 01:42:17,522
Stay away. Go...

1262
01:42:57,230 --> 01:43:00,757
It's okay for you to be here?
They'll be looking for you.

1263
01:43:36,935 --> 01:43:38,425
Yes, yes.

1264
01:43:38,537 --> 01:43:42,234
Journalists tend
to be like that.

1265
01:43:42,708 --> 01:43:46,235
Sir, as I said last time...

1266
01:43:46,779 --> 01:43:48,212
Hello?

1267
01:43:48,514 --> 01:43:49,446
Hello?

1268
01:43:50,182 --> 01:43:52,412
Assholes!

1269
01:43:52,518 --> 01:43:54,543
High-ranking bastards...

1270
01:43:55,154 --> 01:43:56,985
- Chief!
- What?

1271
01:43:57,488 --> 01:44:01,117
It's Investigative Crimes.
They found semen.

1272
01:44:01,392 --> 01:44:02,416
They found what?

1273
01:44:02,527 --> 01:44:04,017
Take a look.

1274
01:44:04,128 --> 01:44:07,029
The semen was found
on the victim's clothing.

1275
01:44:07,130 --> 01:44:11,396
Maybe he masturbated
on the corpse,

1276
01:44:11,502 --> 01:44:13,367
and semen fell on her clothes.

1277
01:44:13,470 --> 01:44:14,801
Wait.

1278
01:44:14,906 --> 01:44:16,601
So...

1279
01:44:16,708 --> 01:44:19,836
...if the DNA in this semen

1280
01:44:19,943 --> 01:44:22,741
is confirmed to match
that of Park Hyun-gyu,

1281
01:44:22,847 --> 01:44:28,979
then the game's over, isn't it?

1282
01:44:29,086 --> 01:44:32,419
Yes, that would be quite
strong evidence.

1283
01:44:32,790 --> 01:44:37,591
The problem is, we don't have
the technology in Korea

1284
01:44:37,694 --> 01:44:39,821
to carry out such tests.

1285
01:44:40,130 --> 01:44:42,155
It must be sent to America.

1286
01:44:42,264 --> 01:44:44,357
There's no other way.

1287
01:44:45,602 --> 01:44:49,231
Once the test's complete,
the results will be released.

1288
01:44:49,339 --> 01:44:52,775
So we just have to wait for
the documents from America?

1289
01:44:52,875 --> 01:44:53,842
That's right.

1290
01:44:55,245 --> 01:44:58,510
You sent people to
watch over Park Hyun-gyu?

1291
01:44:58,614 --> 01:45:02,573
Yes! They're watching
him 24 hours a day.

1292
01:45:03,319 --> 01:45:05,480
Once the result
comes in from America,

1293
01:45:05,588 --> 01:45:09,046
wait until we get our
hands on that bastard.

1294
01:45:25,306 --> 01:45:28,969
What's wrong with your leg?

1295
01:45:29,077 --> 01:45:30,271
Why?

1296
01:45:30,578 --> 01:45:31,704
Did you go to the hospital?

1297
01:45:31,813 --> 01:45:34,475
For this little scratch?
Come here.

1298
01:45:34,581 --> 01:45:37,015
It's okay.
I put on some medicine.

1299
01:45:37,786 --> 01:45:43,918
- What is that?
- Oh, that night...

1300
01:45:44,024 --> 01:45:45,389
It keeps swelling.

1301
01:45:45,659 --> 01:45:47,456
Come on, let's go.

1302
01:45:47,562 --> 01:45:48,494
Just get in.

1303
01:45:49,563 --> 01:45:52,691
So, you have to amputate?

1304
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:55,166
Should I explain it again?

1305
01:45:55,269 --> 01:45:58,067
It was pierced, but why
cut off a healthy leg?

1306
01:45:58,172 --> 01:46:01,164
If you don't, he'll die.

1307
01:46:01,441 --> 01:46:04,933
Tetanus is a brutal thing.

1308
01:46:05,044 --> 01:46:08,070
For rusty nails, you need
to see a doctor fast.

1309
01:46:08,182 --> 01:46:10,650
Bunch of dim-witted boneheads.

1310
01:46:11,618 --> 01:46:16,180
Be grateful it's under the knee.

1311
01:46:17,523 --> 01:46:19,081
Crazy bastards.

1312
01:46:19,193 --> 01:46:20,091
Let's go.

1313
01:46:23,629 --> 01:46:24,527
Are you family?

1314
01:46:24,630 --> 01:46:27,224
He doesn't have any,
but I'm like his brother...

1315
01:46:27,332 --> 01:46:29,129
Anyway, you came together, right?

1316
01:46:29,235 --> 01:46:33,262
The authorization for surgery.
Read it, then sign.

1317
01:46:51,256 --> 01:46:53,087
You fucker...

1318
01:47:08,305 --> 01:47:09,397
Hello, post office?

1319
01:47:10,441 --> 01:47:12,466
It's Suh Tae-yoon,
Investigative Crimes.

1320
01:47:13,978 --> 01:47:16,139
Have the documents
from America arrived?

1321
01:47:19,183 --> 01:47:20,741
Have you checked 100%?

1322
01:47:22,219 --> 01:47:25,211
I keep calling because
it's important!

1323
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:30,786
Since it's so important, please
call as soon as it comes.

1324
01:47:34,498 --> 01:47:35,465
Hello?

1325
01:47:39,202 --> 01:47:40,191
Uh, now?

1326
01:47:41,971 --> 01:47:43,996
Why'd you call me out?

1327
01:47:44,107 --> 01:47:46,769
Why?
Can't I do that sometimes?

1328
01:47:47,776 --> 01:47:49,744
Your face looks worn,

1329
01:47:49,844 --> 01:47:50,902
Are you sleeping well?

1330
01:47:53,414 --> 01:47:55,382
What kind of
detective sleeps well?

1331
01:47:57,786 --> 01:47:59,117
What's wrong with you?

1332
01:47:59,221 --> 01:48:01,712
Fishing? Damn free-riders.

1333
01:48:06,328 --> 01:48:08,387
Why'd you call out a busy man?

1334
01:48:13,134 --> 01:48:15,364
You look like a corpse.

1335
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:21,741
It may be no use asking,

1336
01:48:21,842 --> 01:48:23,366
but can you do anything else?

1337
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:27,375
Can you quit your job?

1338
01:49:49,093 --> 01:49:50,187
Violent Crimes Dept!

1339
01:49:50,827 --> 01:49:51,794
Violent Crimes!

1340
01:49:52,397 --> 01:49:54,763
How many visits in one night?

1341
01:49:54,866 --> 01:49:56,959
Is money that important?

1342
01:49:59,503 --> 01:50:02,597
Bo-kyung's grandmother
collapsed again. I have to go.

1343
01:50:03,141 --> 01:50:06,577
You deserve a medal.

1344
01:50:06,676 --> 01:50:08,974
Get one from
the Health Ministry.

1345
01:50:19,021 --> 01:50:20,181
Chief!

1346
01:50:20,288 --> 01:50:22,449
Park Hyun-gyu hasn't
come home for 2 hours.

1347
01:50:22,557 --> 01:50:25,890
It's only six stops from
there to his house.

1348
01:50:26,229 --> 01:50:28,220
So he must have gotten off.

1349
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:30,855
Would a man under
investigation act so wild?

1350
01:50:30,966 --> 01:50:33,992
He's capable of it.

1351
01:50:34,104 --> 01:50:38,473
- He's instinctively crazy.
- You seem like the crazy one!

1352
01:50:38,574 --> 01:50:44,570
Once the DNA tests arrive,
he's through. Stop it.

1353
01:50:44,980 --> 01:50:47,505
I let him go...

1354
01:50:47,616 --> 01:50:50,346
Don't get so upset!

1355
01:52:31,483 --> 01:52:32,882
Citizens,

1356
01:52:32,984 --> 01:52:36,078
this is a civil defense drill.

1357
01:52:36,187 --> 01:52:43,093
A blackout is called for
in all buildings and houses...

1358
01:53:55,129 --> 01:53:58,792
Will you make any special
investigation into this incident?

1359
01:54:14,247 --> 01:54:17,045
A razor wound in the breast...

1360
01:54:19,886 --> 01:54:21,114
What the hell?

1361
01:54:22,922 --> 01:54:25,254
Something is stuck
inside of the vagina.

1362
01:54:26,826 --> 01:54:30,318
Huh?
Looks like a ball point pen,

1363
01:54:30,797 --> 01:54:32,128
and a spoon.

1364
01:54:33,933 --> 01:54:34,922
Jesus...

1365
01:54:38,270 --> 01:54:40,864
Look inside, closely.

1366
01:54:48,380 --> 01:54:50,405
Wait, what's that?

1367
01:54:51,350 --> 01:54:52,408
An old band-aid.

1368
01:55:07,065 --> 01:55:09,260
What are you doing?

1369
01:55:11,070 --> 01:55:13,334
Why are you touching a corpse?

1370
01:55:38,662 --> 01:55:39,656
What?

1371
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:44,258
Get up, you bastard!

1372
01:55:52,007 --> 01:55:53,941
You fucker!

1373
01:55:57,680 --> 01:55:58,908
Get up, you fucker.

1374
01:56:03,687 --> 01:56:04,585
Are you human?

1375
01:56:17,700 --> 01:56:21,761
Nobody will care if I kill you.

1376
01:56:32,212 --> 01:56:33,372
Tell me!

1377
01:56:35,014 --> 01:56:36,572
Tell me you killed them!

1378
01:56:39,387 --> 01:56:40,615
Tell me!

1379
01:56:41,523 --> 01:56:44,356
You killed all those women!

1380
01:57:04,411 --> 01:57:06,174
Yeah.

1381
01:57:06,279 --> 01:57:09,806
I killed them.

1382
01:57:09,917 --> 01:57:11,544
I killed them all.

1383
01:57:15,888 --> 01:57:17,753
That's what you want
to hear, right?

1384
01:57:19,126 --> 01:57:20,286
Right?

1385
01:57:21,727 --> 01:57:24,195
You feel better?

1386
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:31,025
Inspector Suh!

1387
01:57:32,271 --> 01:57:34,364
The papers from America!

1388
01:57:35,140 --> 01:57:36,004
Read them!

1389
01:57:37,709 --> 01:57:39,040
You asshole.

1390
01:57:41,414 --> 01:57:42,210
You fucker!

1391
01:57:43,915 --> 01:57:45,075
You mocked us, didn't you!

1392
01:57:45,183 --> 01:57:46,844
You bastard!

1393
01:57:48,786 --> 01:57:50,117
You mocked us!

1394
01:58:07,638 --> 01:58:08,468
What's wrong?

1395
01:58:40,937 --> 01:58:44,338
There's a mistake.

1396
01:58:53,248 --> 01:58:55,808
This document is a lie.
I don't need it.

1397
01:59:09,798 --> 01:59:12,130
What does it say, huh?

1398
01:59:20,408 --> 01:59:21,670
It really wasn't you?

1399
01:59:30,217 --> 01:59:31,411
Look in my eyes.

1400
02:00:03,216 --> 02:00:04,513
Look in my eyes!

1401
02:00:19,531 --> 02:00:21,089
Fuck, I don't know.

1402
02:00:28,606 --> 02:00:30,335
Do you get up each morning too?

1403
02:00:34,946 --> 02:00:35,878
Go!

1404
02:00:38,683 --> 02:00:40,617
Just go, fucker!

1405
02:00:44,522 --> 02:00:46,114
Bastard.

1406
02:01:55,691 --> 02:01:57,249
That's enough.

1407
02:02:37,998 --> 02:02:40,364
Chi-hyuk.

1408
02:02:40,467 --> 02:02:42,628
You played computer
games all night, right?

1409
02:02:44,170 --> 02:02:47,003
Did you or didn't you?

1410
02:02:51,811 --> 02:02:53,438
Look in my eyes, son.

1411
02:02:54,614 --> 02:02:56,104
Eyes all bloodshot.

1412
02:02:57,316 --> 02:02:58,977
Do you play well?

1413
02:02:59,085 --> 02:02:59,949
Yeah!

1414
02:03:00,253 --> 02:03:03,313
You don't study, might as
well be good at games.

1415
02:03:04,857 --> 02:03:08,918
If you won't study,
go get some exercise.

1416
02:03:09,027 --> 02:03:11,587
Sitting in front
of the computer...

1417
02:03:11,697 --> 02:03:13,221
I really didn't!

1418
02:03:13,498 --> 02:03:15,295
What do you mean you didn't?

1419
02:03:15,400 --> 02:03:17,527
Think you can fool my eyes?

1420
02:03:18,870 --> 02:03:21,566
He said he didn't.
Believe him.

1421
02:03:21,673 --> 02:03:27,942
No, two days ago Manager Oh
called my company.

1422
02:03:28,045 --> 02:03:32,311
He kept saying you can't do
this to people, it's not fair.

1423
02:03:32,784 --> 02:03:36,151
You can't believe him.

1424
02:03:36,821 --> 02:03:40,086
Did I do anything wrong?

1425
02:03:40,191 --> 02:03:44,560
I'm on the road now
with our product.

1426
02:03:46,230 --> 02:03:51,167
Sure, let's have dinner
with Manager Oh.

1427
02:03:51,936 --> 02:03:53,699
It's been a while.

1428
02:03:57,007 --> 02:03:59,669
Chul-yong!
Pull over a minute!

1429
02:05:37,970 --> 02:05:39,494
Is something in there?

1430
02:05:41,374 --> 02:05:42,807
Is anything in there?

1431
02:05:44,310 --> 02:05:45,675
No...

1432
02:05:47,012 --> 02:05:48,639
Then why are you looking?

1433
02:05:50,950 --> 02:05:52,611
I'm just looking.

1434
02:05:53,485 --> 02:05:55,419
That's so weird.

1435
02:05:57,156 --> 02:05:58,180
What is?

1436
02:06:00,025 --> 02:06:01,583
A while back,

1437
02:06:01,694 --> 02:06:05,824
a man was here
looking into that hole.

1438
02:06:09,634 --> 02:06:12,626
I asked him the same question.

1439
02:06:13,171 --> 02:06:15,196
Why he was looking there.

1440
02:06:15,306 --> 02:06:16,500
What did he say?

1441
02:06:17,809 --> 02:06:19,572
What was it?

1442
02:06:19,677 --> 02:06:21,338
Right...

1443
02:06:21,446 --> 02:06:25,712
He remembered doing
something here long ago,

1444
02:06:25,817 --> 02:06:29,514
so he came back
to take a look.

1445
02:06:43,433 --> 02:06:45,264
Did you see his face?

1446
02:06:50,639 --> 02:06:52,106
What did he look like?

1447
02:06:53,944 --> 02:06:55,104
Well...

1448
02:06:57,080 --> 02:06:58,547
Kind of plain.

1449
02:07:01,050 --> 02:07:01,948
In what way?

1450
02:07:05,221 --> 02:07:06,483
Just...

1451
02:07:08,791 --> 02:07:10,554
ordinary.

1452
02:07:15,791 --> 02:07:35,554
