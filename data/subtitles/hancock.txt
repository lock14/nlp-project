00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:45,814
All units, all units.
Code 3 pursuit of 2-11.

3
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:48,374
White SUV heading east
on Alameda service road.

4
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:49,853
Suspects: three Asian males.

5
00:00:51,499 --> 00:00:53,455
Be advised. Shots fired, shots fired.

6
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,652
Cheryl, can you see how many
suspects are in this car?

7
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,056
As far as I can see at this point,
there are three sus--

8
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,852
Oh, this is just coming in.

9
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,091
Hancock!

10
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,049
What, boy?

11
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,288
Bad guys.

12
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,809
--trying to cut them off.
You can see them there.

13
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,056
They have their hands
outside the white SUV...

14
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,696
...shooting randomly on the freeway.

15
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,733
What, you want a cookie?
Get out of my face.

16
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,809
Asshole.

17
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,695
-What?
-You heard me.

18
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,894
Please, stay off the freeway.

19
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,536
I understand that there are
three suspects in the white SUV--

20
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,298
Asshole.

21
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,212
Watch out!

22
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,538
Damn!

23
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,012
Damn it!

24
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:44,740
Hancock!?!

25
00:03:45,781 --> 00:03:47,658
Beat it, 'Soulja Boy!'

26
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:49,775
Hancock is in the car...

27
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:52,336
...and he appears to be
negotiating with the gunmen.

28
00:03:53,181 --> 00:03:54,773
He smells like a bar!

29
00:03:56,261 --> 00:03:58,138
You pay for new roof!

30
00:03:58,381 --> 00:04:01,976
Fellas, hey. I don't give a shit
what you did. I don't care.

31
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:05,691
Three guys in the car,
no girls, rave music.

32
00:04:05,901 --> 00:04:07,300
Hey, I'm not gonna judge.

33
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:11,769
But if you don't pull over
and give yourselves up quietly...

34
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:16,213
...I swear to Christ, your head
is going up the driver's ass.

35
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:19,652
His head is going up your ass.
And you drew the short stick...

36
00:04:19,861 --> 00:04:22,170
...because your head
is going up my ass.

37
00:04:23,101 --> 00:04:25,217
Shoot this asshole!

38
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:31,056
Stop!

39
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,249
What the F%@#K?

40
00:04:45,421 --> 00:04:48,970
The department is on their way.
There's just chaos here on the 105.

41
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:04,056
What? I'm not Japanese, man!

42
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:05,216
Put us down!

43
00:05:05,781 --> 00:05:08,534
Oh, now you "speaky Engly," huh?
"Speaky Engly" now?

44
00:05:20,262 --> 00:05:21,661
You broke my glasses.

45
00:05:21,902 --> 00:05:23,972
I'm sorry! Take my Ray-Bans!

46
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,137
-Put us down!
-You want down?

47
00:05:27,342 --> 00:05:28,695
-Yes, please! Please!
-Help me!

48
00:05:28,902 --> 00:05:32,178
I'm real good at down.
I'm real good at down.

49
00:05:32,382 --> 00:05:33,610
All right? All right.

50
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,812
This, Hancock's latest act
of so-called heroics...

51
00:05:43,022 --> 00:05:44,978
... took a hefty financial toll.

52
00:05:45,182 --> 00:05:49,221
Initial damage estimates
are said to top $9 million...

53
00:05:49,422 --> 00:05:50,537
... which, if accurate...

54
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:52,773
...represents a personal record...

55
00:05:52,982 --> 00:05:56,019
... for the notoriously publicity-shy
Hancock...

56
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:59,897
...who, as usual,
can't be reached for comment.

57
00:06:00,102 --> 00:06:04,698
With all the cracks to the concrete,
all the bullets, water damage, fires...

58
00:06:04,902 --> 00:06:07,336
...L.A. would be better off
if this guy would leave...

59
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:09,100
...and let us get on with our jobs.

60
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:43,255
Hi.

61
00:06:44,302 --> 00:06:47,100
Don't think I'm crazy, okay?
We've looked everywhere for you.

62
00:06:47,302 --> 00:06:50,772
Going to the Roxy
and the Viper Room and Jumbo's...

63
00:06:50,982 --> 00:06:54,418
...anywhere we thought
you would be at. I found you.

64
00:06:54,902 --> 00:06:56,893
I got you.

65
00:06:57,982 --> 00:06:59,700
So, what's it like when you fly?

66
00:07:03,783 --> 00:07:06,343
-No, what?
-I ain't gonna fly you.

67
00:07:06,703 --> 00:07:09,820
I got a cousin, Narelle. She's my
best friend in the entire world...

68
00:07:10,023 --> 00:07:13,140
...and I swear to God she would not
be here today if it wasn't for you.

69
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:16,975
She crashed her car up in Malibu
and you flew her to the hospital.

70
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:18,582
Remember?

71
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,502
I will break my foot off
in your ass, woman.

72
00:07:25,543 --> 00:07:27,056
You got a car?

73
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,702
Hey, want a drink?

74
00:07:52,863 --> 00:07:56,572
So this is where you live.
This is your hideout.

75
00:07:57,303 --> 00:07:59,214
Your Batcave.

76
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,098
Your Fortress of Solitude.

77
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:07,138
-It's a couple trailers I stuck together.
-What's all this?

78
00:08:08,463 --> 00:08:10,818
-Jiffy Pop.
-Jiffy Pop.

79
00:08:11,103 --> 00:08:13,492
-What do you do with it?
-Pop it.

80
00:08:13,783 --> 00:08:16,536
-Jiffy Pop, pop. I like that.
-Hey, hey.

81
00:08:16,743 --> 00:08:17,698
Hold on.

82
00:08:17,903 --> 00:08:20,258
Want me to give you
something else to pop?

83
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:23,297
-I didn't catch your name.
-Pop this, Superman.

84
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,813
Not much for the chitchat, huh?
Let me set this over here.

85
00:08:27,023 --> 00:08:28,934
-All right. Now, there are some rules.
-Hello?

86
00:08:29,143 --> 00:08:31,452
-No, I know, I haven't seen it yet.
-Excuse me.

87
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:33,540
I know, probably. All right, all right.

88
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:35,540
-Let me call you back.
-Listen.

89
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:39,341
You're gonna need to focus.
All right, I need you--

90
00:08:39,543 --> 00:08:42,103
-Hey, that's-- That's not focusing.
-What's in there?

91
00:08:42,303 --> 00:08:46,182
Okay, all right, hold on.
Stop. Stop it. All right, now...

92
00:08:46,383 --> 00:08:49,421
-...when I get to the moment....
-The moment?

93
00:08:49,624 --> 00:08:54,254
You know, the-- Start climbing
the mountaintop, you know?

94
00:08:54,464 --> 00:08:56,534
-You know.... All right? Yes.
-Yeah.

95
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,258
You're gonna need to be as far away
from that as possible.

96
00:08:59,464 --> 00:09:01,614
-Far. That's hot.
-No, that's not hot. It's not hot.

97
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:03,940
-Oh, yeah.
-Okay.

98
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,663
Hancock. Oh, yeah.

99
00:09:08,904 --> 00:09:11,577
-Now you're doing too much.
-Hancock.

100
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,742
Oh, mountaintop! Mountaintop!

101
00:09:14,944 --> 00:09:16,821
Mountaintop! Watch out!

102
00:09:37,104 --> 00:09:38,696
Sorry.

103
00:09:42,064 --> 00:09:44,339
That's not fair to anybody.

104
00:09:49,424 --> 00:09:51,574
Thank you for being okay with that.

105
00:09:51,784 --> 00:09:55,538
-I know it's....
-Can I use the bathroom, please?

106
00:09:55,744 --> 00:09:58,861
Yeah. Hey, you--?
You want some Jiffy Pop?

107
00:09:59,064 --> 00:10:02,340
-No, thanks.
-It's straight back.

108
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,703
-You all right?
-Yeah.

109
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:07,974
Yeah, I was trying to tell you.

110
00:10:13,104 --> 00:10:14,742
Hey....

111
00:10:19,904 --> 00:10:24,500
Listen-- You know, if you want
I could fly you.

112
00:10:25,384 --> 00:10:28,899
It's really beautiful, you know?
Earth.

113
00:10:29,664 --> 00:10:31,973
You could see the--

114
00:10:36,665 --> 00:10:41,375
Might have to get you a helmet,
so your face doesn't tear off.

115
00:10:42,465 --> 00:10:44,103
What do you think?

116
00:11:22,705 --> 00:11:24,343
Sir? Ray Embrey.

117
00:11:24,545 --> 00:11:25,773
-Ray.
-Pleasure.

118
00:11:26,745 --> 00:11:29,213
-So....
-Ray's like the Bono of P.R.

119
00:11:29,945 --> 00:11:33,335
Well, actually, I think Bono
is the Bono of P.R., but I do try.

120
00:11:33,545 --> 00:11:35,103
Well, let's see it.

121
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:38,542
Okay. I'll get right into it.
Good morning, everyone.

122
00:11:38,745 --> 00:11:42,101
I'm here to talk to you
about charitable giving.

123
00:11:42,545 --> 00:11:44,376
Okay? And we all know
the way that works.

124
00:11:44,585 --> 00:11:47,224
You give one, maybe two percent
of your net cash...

125
00:11:47,425 --> 00:11:49,893
...and you get an armband,
or a ribbon or whatever.

126
00:11:50,105 --> 00:11:51,299
It's nowhere near enough.

127
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:56,101
And that's why we at Embrey Publicity
would like to offer you...

128
00:11:56,385 --> 00:11:58,182
...the AllHeart symbol.

129
00:11:58,505 --> 00:12:03,738
Now, you would be among a very
select group of corporate giants...

130
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,143
...to bear this logo on your product.

131
00:12:07,345 --> 00:12:09,222
And what this would say
to the public...

132
00:12:09,425 --> 00:12:11,222
...is that your company,
Pharmatopsis...

133
00:12:11,425 --> 00:12:15,577
...has made a radical contribution
to helping our world.

134
00:12:15,785 --> 00:12:17,582
Here's all you need to do to qualify.

135
00:12:18,265 --> 00:12:21,496
Your new TB drug, Mycodin?

136
00:12:21,705 --> 00:12:24,664
We would like for you to give
that product away for free.

137
00:12:28,146 --> 00:12:29,704
-Did you say "free"?
-I did.

138
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:33,581
Only to those who need it.

139
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:37,017
Only to those who without it
would otherwise die.

140
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:40,975
As a concept, free is kind of up there
with, you know, lethal side effects.

141
00:12:41,186 --> 00:12:43,541
-Mandatory product recall.
-Get indicted, go to jail.

142
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:46,465
Get out, work at lHOP
for the rest of your career.

143
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,941
Understandable reaction.
It's a radical concept.

144
00:12:49,146 --> 00:12:53,264
But it is the brand that represents
a fairer and better world.

145
00:12:53,466 --> 00:12:54,660
The brand...

146
00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:58,296
...that everyone is talking about.

147
00:12:58,506 --> 00:13:00,303
Who is "everyone"?

148
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:02,974
We do already have
a sports franchise.

149
00:13:03,186 --> 00:13:06,064
-NFL? NBA? MLB?
-Soccer.

150
00:13:06,266 --> 00:13:08,541
MLS? Which team?

151
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,624
Well, it's a local team.
Encino Hurricanes.

152
00:13:12,986 --> 00:13:14,180
It's my son's team.

153
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:18,221
Anyway, we can save the world.

154
00:13:18,426 --> 00:13:21,577
All right?
Someone's just gotta go first.

155
00:13:22,186 --> 00:13:24,097
What do you say?

156
00:13:25,866 --> 00:13:28,141
Are you a crackpot?

157
00:13:36,026 --> 00:13:39,336
Hey, hon. You're probably
at the store. I am on my way.

158
00:13:39,546 --> 00:13:42,697
I think I made a connection.

159
00:13:43,986 --> 00:13:44,975
Not really.

160
00:13:45,186 --> 00:13:47,495
Listen, tell Aaron that I'm coming
and l-- Damn it.

161
00:13:47,706 --> 00:13:49,822
And I want some meatballs, okay?

162
00:13:50,026 --> 00:13:53,541
I need some Spaghetti Madness.
I'll see you in about 20 minutes.

163
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:57,102
Hey! What is it, National Horn Day?

164
00:13:57,906 --> 00:13:59,703
Idiot.

165
00:14:03,466 --> 00:14:04,899
Hey.

166
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:06,738
Hey. Hey!

167
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:08,982
Move it. There's a train coming.

168
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:11,302
Do you not hear that horn?

169
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:13,856
Let's go! I got a train!

170
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:15,739
Move it!

171
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:19,059
-Back your car up! There's a train!
-I can't go anywhere. Get out!

172
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:20,666
Son of a bitch!

173
00:14:22,507 --> 00:14:24,577
Fix the handle, Ray. Fix the handle.

174
00:14:29,907 --> 00:14:31,465
Get out!

175
00:14:36,987 --> 00:14:38,898
Get off the track! Move!

176
00:14:47,227 --> 00:14:49,457
-Let's get him out.
-Get him out of there.

177
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:51,737
-Somebody help him.
-You all right?

178
00:14:51,947 --> 00:14:54,507
Please, that guy's still in there.

179
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:57,056
You sure?

180
00:14:57,307 --> 00:14:59,775
Get him out of there!

181
00:15:06,147 --> 00:15:07,546
Will you look at that?

182
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:32,185
-Ah, shit.
-I'm all right. I'm okay.

183
00:15:32,387 --> 00:15:33,581
All of you people...

184
00:15:34,387 --> 00:15:36,821
...blocking the intersection...

185
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:38,540
...you're all idiots.

186
00:15:38,747 --> 00:15:41,705
You threw the dude's car at her.
And what's with the train?

187
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:45,104
Why didn't you just go straight up
in the air with the car?

188
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:47,898
You've obviously injured
that poor woman.

189
00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:51,941
-She's right. She should sue you.
-Yeah, she should sue you.

190
00:15:52,147 --> 00:15:54,866
Well, you should sue McDonald's
because they fucked you up.

191
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:57,297
You're an asshole.

192
00:15:57,507 --> 00:15:59,702
And I can smell
that liquor on your breath.

193
00:15:59,948 --> 00:16:02,906
-Because I've been drinking, bitch.
-You're a drunk asshole!

194
00:16:03,108 --> 00:16:06,737
-You think you're such a hero.
-Asshole!

195
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:10,865
-You're nothing but an asshole.
-We don't need you in this city.

196
00:16:12,628 --> 00:16:15,665
Some superhero you are! Fly off!

197
00:16:16,468 --> 00:16:18,026
Shut up!

198
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,707
Don't you understand? I'm alive.

199
00:16:19,908 --> 00:16:23,378
I get to go home and see my family.
I should be dead right now, right here.

200
00:16:23,588 --> 00:16:26,386
Yeah, he could've gone straight up.
Obviously, you should've.

201
00:16:26,588 --> 00:16:30,297
You know, and I was upside down
for the train, but....

202
00:16:31,308 --> 00:16:33,538
No. Thank you.

203
00:16:34,268 --> 00:16:36,657
Thank you very much, Hancock.
Thank you.

204
00:16:36,868 --> 00:16:38,984
Thank you, Hancock.

205
00:16:42,788 --> 00:16:45,461
You're not flying by the Valley,
are you?

206
00:16:49,628 --> 00:16:51,425
Throw the ball!

207
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:55,301
Monte, one guy'll line up here,
all right? Hike the ball.

208
00:16:55,508 --> 00:16:57,544
This guy'll be right here
and he says, "Hut!"

209
00:16:57,748 --> 00:17:01,218
This guy'll drop back. Hut!
Drop back. Chuck it.

210
00:17:02,148 --> 00:17:04,867
Great. Thank you.

211
00:17:05,228 --> 00:17:07,458
Nice aim. The driveway
would've been better, but--

212
00:17:07,668 --> 00:17:09,386
-What's going on, Dad?
-Hey, buddy.

213
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:12,056
Daddy's had a little bit of a day.
Look at you, huh?

214
00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:13,502
I want you to meet somebody.

215
00:17:13,748 --> 00:17:16,899
This guy here, dragging
Daddy's car into the driveway.

216
00:17:17,588 --> 00:17:19,419
-Who's this?
-Hancock.

217
00:17:19,628 --> 00:17:21,744
That's right. Hancock,
this is my boy, Aaron.

218
00:17:21,948 --> 00:17:24,462
-Ray, what happened to the car?
-Oh, boy.

219
00:17:24,828 --> 00:17:26,261
You would not have believed it.

220
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:30,257
I came this close to getting hit
by a train. If it wasn't for that guy....

221
00:17:30,468 --> 00:17:33,505
He saved my life. I mean--
Hancock, this is my wife, Mary.

222
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,460
Believe that? I almost kissed a train.

223
00:17:35,668 --> 00:17:37,579
Saw my whole life
flash before my eyes.

224
00:17:37,788 --> 00:17:40,177
-He saved your life?
-He sure did. Thank you.

225
00:17:40,388 --> 00:17:41,946
-Hey, you good?
-I am good, yeah.

226
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:46,266
-All right. Keep it off the tracks.
-I will, definitely.

227
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:51,788
Hang on a-- One second.

228
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:55,220
-Hancock, you eat, yes? Human food?
-Yeah.

229
00:17:55,429 --> 00:17:56,657
-You like meatballs?
-No.

230
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:58,780
Aaron, sweetheart,
he has to go and do--

231
00:17:58,989 --> 00:17:59,978
I love meatballs.

232
00:18:00,189 --> 00:18:01,861
Who's so busy
they can't have a meal?

233
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:03,468
And it's on us. Please.

234
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:06,979
I'm not even gonna take no
for an answer. Get inside the house.

235
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:33,542
Why do you have an eagle
on your hat?

236
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:36,343
Do you like eagles?

237
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:38,625
This guy's like a little
talking machine, huh?

238
00:18:38,829 --> 00:18:40,660
We don't have a lot of guests
over here.

239
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,178
Look at that, huh?
Hon, is the heat on?

240
00:18:44,229 --> 00:18:46,106
No? All right.

241
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:50,022
We started Spaghetti Madness
about two years ago.

242
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:53,744
We do it every Thursday, and we
have not missed a Thursday in....

243
00:18:53,949 --> 00:18:55,098
-Ever.
-Yeah.

244
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:57,425
-Ever? That's a long time.
-Yes, sir.

245
00:18:57,629 --> 00:19:00,462
-A very long time.
-That's some good meatballs, boy.

246
00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:01,898
Aaron.

247
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:03,906
-Your mama's calling you.
-Yes, Mom?

248
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:06,299
No. His name is Aaron.

249
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:09,461
-Hey, Aaron, how was school today?
-Fine.

250
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:12,229
Yeah? No more problems
with that bully, Michael?

251
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:15,580
-Michel. But not like a girl's name.
-Michel. No, no, I know.

252
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:18,178
-It's French.
-Yeah. Michel, Hancock, is this--

253
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:21,582
Hancock? Michel
is this neighbourhood bully.

254
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:23,825
We've been trying to teach Aaron
a little...

255
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,589
...about conflict resolution.
You know what I mean?

256
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:30,304
-Yeah. Turn the other cheek, all that?
-That's exactly right.

257
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:33,701
Well, just never turn that one,
all right?

258
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:35,183
Never let them punk you.

259
00:19:35,389 --> 00:19:36,903
-Got it, Mr. Hancock.
-Aaron, eat.

260
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:40,421
The way you deal with bullies,
you take your right foot...

261
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,383
...bring it right up and catch him
in his little piss pump.

262
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,820
You don't have to do that,
honey, okay? Seriously.

263
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,985
It's a good idea.

264
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,909
You aim straight and make sure
he can't use that thing...

265
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:53,068
...for nothing but a flap to keep
the dust out of his butt crack.

266
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,623
Okay, please, just stop.

267
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,468
Michel is not a man, okay?

268
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,342
He's a little boy. And his parents...

269
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:01,906
...happen to be going through a bad
divorce. That's why he's acting up.

270
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,338
Maybe you don't know this...

271
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,508
...but not everything in this world
gets resolved with force.

272
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,621
-Not everything has to be bang...
-I'm set.

273
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:13,426
-...scream, blood, more blood.
-Baby, I got plenty. Angel! We're okay.

274
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,949
She watches so much news...

275
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,579
...that sometimes
it gets to be a little too much.

276
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:21,067
-You got a toilet?
-Yep. Yeah, just past the fridge.

277
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,987
Are--?

278
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,784
Did he just take the whisky bottle
to the bathroom?

279
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,389
Do you want him to kill us all?

280
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,462
Thanks for coming on in.
Good, right?

281
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,706
-Very, yeah.
-Wanna say goodbye to him?

282
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,105
-Bye, Hancock.
-Hey, all right, little buddy.

283
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,185
-Are you okay?
-lt was a joke.

284
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,779
-Come on, Aaron.
-Hey, sorry. I was just trying to--

285
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,309
He got it. She didn't get it.

286
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,785
I owe you.
You gave me my life back today.

287
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,901
Hear me out.
I'd like to return the favour.

288
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,670
Do you know what I do?
I'm in public relations.

289
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,306
You know what that is? Of course
you do. We're image consultants.

290
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,580
We change the way people see
products, companies...

291
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,745
...people, that stuff.

292
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,748
Listen, I see you on the news
and I see you out there today...

293
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:09,260
...and it can't feel good that people,
you know, hate you.

294
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,426
-It's good to meet you, Ray.
-No, I'm sorry.

295
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,745
But hear me out.

296
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:16,420
People-- Don't get me wrong, they
should love you. They really should.

297
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,303
I wanna deliver that for you.
It's the least that I can do.

298
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,829
You know, you're a superhero.

299
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,941
Kids should ask you
for your autograph.

300
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,869
People should cheer you
on the streets.

301
00:21:25,071 --> 00:21:26,823
What the hell are you pricks
looking at?

302
00:21:27,031 --> 00:21:28,749
No, no, they're not-- It's all right.

303
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:30,782
They're not pricks,
they're just people.

304
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:34,307
But I want you to give me
one short pitch, you know?

305
00:21:34,511 --> 00:21:37,025
That's all I ask. Okay?

306
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:38,943
You use....

307
00:21:39,271 --> 00:21:41,068
Put it under here?

308
00:21:41,751 --> 00:21:43,503
Put it right there. Perfect.

309
00:21:43,711 --> 00:21:46,430
E-mail me or whatever.
You just fly on over, I don't know.

310
00:21:46,631 --> 00:21:47,950
I want you to think about it.

311
00:21:48,151 --> 00:21:50,540
Just be careful when you go.
Sleep on it, all right?

312
00:21:50,751 --> 00:21:52,742
You get back to me?

313
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,749
I'll be right here. All right.

314
00:21:54,951 --> 00:21:59,183
Please don't stare, you guys.
He's kind of one of us.

315
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:05,940
What about AllHeart?

316
00:22:06,151 --> 00:22:09,268
It's a nonstarter, babe, you know?
I'm chasing windmills with that.

317
00:22:09,471 --> 00:22:12,463
Maybe I can't change the world
but I can change this guy's life.

318
00:22:12,671 --> 00:22:16,141
-Think about all the good he can do.
-I think you're wasting your time.

319
00:22:16,471 --> 00:22:17,984
You really hate him.

320
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:21,183
Hate? I don't hate him, Ray.
I don't even know the guy.

321
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:25,185
Just look at the news.
You can see what he does.

322
00:22:25,391 --> 00:22:28,781
I think he just needs
people to care, you know?

323
00:22:30,471 --> 00:22:32,348
You see the good in everybody, Ray.

324
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:35,384
Even sometimes when it's not there.

325
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:40,420
I have a feeling about this.
Don't work with this guy.

326
00:22:43,151 --> 00:22:45,790
I know this kind of guy.
He breaks things.

327
00:24:41,392 --> 00:24:42,871
My bad. Everybody all right?

328
00:24:43,072 --> 00:24:45,540
I'll go and get my mommy.

329
00:24:45,752 --> 00:24:47,982
He is an asshole.

330
00:24:55,152 --> 00:24:57,108
-What's your name, boy?
-Michel.

331
00:25:00,073 --> 00:25:03,463
-You know who I am?
-My papa says you are an asshole.

332
00:25:03,673 --> 00:25:06,312
Well, that's not really a nice word
to call a person, is it?

333
00:25:06,513 --> 00:25:08,265
-Asshole?
-Yeah.

334
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:11,351
Because that could make someone
very angry...

335
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:13,623
...and, you know, maybe
hurt their feelings.

336
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:15,266
You behave like an asshole.

337
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:20,342
All right....

338
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:21,986
Do you know Aaron?

339
00:25:25,993 --> 00:25:30,271
Well, seems to be a pretty good kid.

340
00:25:30,473 --> 00:25:32,703
Just wanna ask you
to lay off of him a little bit.

341
00:25:32,913 --> 00:25:34,505
Why, asshole?

342
00:25:37,753 --> 00:25:40,108
-You're gonna stop calling me that.
-Asshole.

343
00:25:40,793 --> 00:25:44,149
-That's not my name.
-Asshole.

344
00:25:48,153 --> 00:25:50,348
Call me a asshole...

345
00:25:50,553 --> 00:25:51,827
...one more time.

346
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:57,351
Asshole.

347
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:02,269
How about you, thickness?

348
00:26:02,873 --> 00:26:03,862
Goggles?

349
00:26:04,473 --> 00:26:07,783
Hancock! You son of a gun,
I knew you'd come.

350
00:26:07,993 --> 00:26:09,312
Ask Mary. I had a feeling.

351
00:26:09,513 --> 00:26:11,629
I said, he heard me
and he's ready for a change.

352
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:14,427
This is great. Did you do this?
You come in a little hot?

353
00:26:14,633 --> 00:26:16,032
I'll meet you in the house.

354
00:26:16,233 --> 00:26:19,111
-I know you don't drive, but--
-Oh, damn it, Ray.

355
00:26:20,433 --> 00:26:24,551
All right. You're all right.
You're all right. You're all right.

356
00:26:26,513 --> 00:26:29,505
Oh, stop crying, punk-ass. Go ahead.

357
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:33,306
-Not okay. Okay?
-He all right.

358
00:26:33,753 --> 00:26:36,586
Really not okay. This is some
of the stuff we're gonna work on.

359
00:26:36,793 --> 00:26:39,705
How do you think that conversation's
gonna go down with his mom?

360
00:26:39,913 --> 00:26:42,507
Landing like that in the street's
also on the uncool side.

361
00:26:42,753 --> 00:26:45,825
No, that was already like that
when I got here, Ray.

362
00:26:46,073 --> 00:26:48,065
I live here.
I know what the street's like.

363
00:26:48,314 --> 00:26:50,032
We'll make those problems
of the past.

364
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,589
I'm gonna teach you
how to interface with the public.

365
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:55,792
-Where's the wife?
-Mary took Aaron to his soccer game.

366
00:26:55,994 --> 00:26:57,871
Hancock, pulled some stuff up
on YouTube.

367
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:02,147
Surprisingly large amount of not-great
stuff on you that's gonna be helpful.

368
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:03,548
What is this?

369
00:27:03,754 --> 00:27:06,348
That's me trying to change the world.

370
00:27:06,554 --> 00:27:08,351
Unfortunately, not doing real well.

371
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:10,346
Come on. Let's get to you.

372
00:27:10,794 --> 00:27:12,910
This stuff was on YouTube.

373
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:16,265
Everybody loves a Nutty Buddy,
I get it, but this doesn't work, sir.

374
00:27:16,474 --> 00:27:17,114
Hey, give me a Nutty Buddy.
Back up, back up.

375
00:27:17,114 --> 00:27:20,072
Hey, give me a Nutty Buddy.
Back up, back up.

376
00:27:20,954 --> 00:27:24,424
Mom! Mom! Mom!

377
00:27:24,874 --> 00:27:26,307
Those are children.

378
00:27:28,154 --> 00:27:31,191
-We've been waiting a long time--
-Get that camera out of my face.

379
00:27:31,514 --> 00:27:34,586
You ever put out
an apartment fire, Ray?

380
00:27:34,834 --> 00:27:38,190
-No, I haven't done that. I'm in P.R.
-No. My ass was hot.

381
00:27:39,674 --> 00:27:42,427
All right. How about this?
This is Walter, the grey whale.

382
00:27:42,634 --> 00:27:45,228
Everybody remembers him
stuck on the beach north of Zuma.

383
00:27:45,434 --> 00:27:46,423
Along comes Hancock.

384
00:27:48,954 --> 00:27:50,626
Hancock!

385
00:27:59,794 --> 00:28:02,183
-I don't even remember that.
-Yeah.

386
00:28:02,434 --> 00:28:05,392
Greenpeace does. Walter does.

387
00:28:06,154 --> 00:28:07,792
This gets redundant after a while...

388
00:28:07,994 --> 00:28:10,952
...but my basic diagnosis
of your fundamental problem is--

389
00:28:11,154 --> 00:28:12,712
-Do you wanna hear it?
-No.

390
00:28:13,114 --> 00:28:14,149
You're an asshole.

391
00:28:14,714 --> 00:28:16,511
I know. I call it like I see it though.

392
00:28:16,714 --> 00:28:19,547
It's not a crime to be an asshole
but it's counterproductive.

393
00:28:19,754 --> 00:28:21,631
But you are an asshole,
don't you think?

394
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:23,392
Be careful.

395
00:28:23,594 --> 00:28:26,666
All right, how about this?
I've been thinking about something.

396
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:29,342
This kind of goes to
how you present yourself.

397
00:28:29,554 --> 00:28:32,671
Come on. Really? It's the middle
of the day. What springs to mind...

398
00:28:33,874 --> 00:28:35,149
...when you see this?

399
00:28:36,995 --> 00:28:37,984
Homo.

400
00:28:40,155 --> 00:28:41,668
-What about that?
-Homo in red.

401
00:28:45,195 --> 00:28:46,913
-Norwegian homo.
-I'll give you that.

402
00:28:47,115 --> 00:28:50,266
Let's move past the comics. Let's
get into something a little deeper.

403
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:55,424
I think that deep down you behave
badly because you're lonely.

404
00:28:55,635 --> 00:28:58,354
I think deep down,
you want people's acceptance.

405
00:28:59,795 --> 00:29:01,945
Come on, now.
You save people's lives...

406
00:29:02,155 --> 00:29:05,067
...and they reject you,
and so you reject them back.

407
00:29:05,275 --> 00:29:07,948
And it's a--
And we're gonna switch that cycle.

408
00:29:08,155 --> 00:29:09,827
We're gonna start fresh, start anew.

409
00:29:10,035 --> 00:29:13,710
This is outstanding. If you turn
some of this power into willpower....

410
00:29:14,075 --> 00:29:16,066
-Almost.
-And then he kicked it in.

411
00:29:16,275 --> 00:29:18,106
Hey, Hancock! We almost won.

412
00:29:18,315 --> 00:29:21,387
Yeah, we did. Okay, upstairs.
I'm making lunch. Go change.

413
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:22,954
Hey, sweetheart.

414
00:29:24,315 --> 00:29:25,794
Have you been watching the news?

415
00:29:25,995 --> 00:29:28,589
-No, we've been working on--
-lnterfacing with the public.

416
00:29:28,835 --> 00:29:30,826
-This has been on all day.
-That's very good.

417
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:34,311
The law is the law, Mr. Hancock,
and you are not above it.

418
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:37,633
Felony destruction of property...

419
00:29:37,835 --> 00:29:41,384
...amounting to tens of millions
of dollars, theft, and now this.

420
00:29:41,595 --> 00:29:45,873
From where I sit,
I see a selfish, self-absorbed man...

421
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:50,193
... with a lot of muscle, but no regard
for anyone but yourself.

422
00:29:50,395 --> 00:29:52,590
Mr. Hancock, let me remind you.

423
00:29:52,795 --> 00:29:55,434
You are not above the law.

424
00:29:55,635 --> 00:30:00,265
You have failed to show
at over 600 subpoenas in civil suits.

425
00:30:00,515 --> 00:30:03,951
Anybody else would be held
in contempt. But, oh, no. Not you.

426
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:07,147
You may be a superhero,
but let me tell you this:

427
00:30:07,355 --> 00:30:10,984
You're not nearly as strong
as the U.S. Constitution.

428
00:30:11,195 --> 00:30:12,594
Bank on it, buddy.

429
00:30:13,235 --> 00:30:14,429
We do not condone the t--

430
00:30:16,155 --> 00:30:17,508
Genius.

431
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:20,104
Things just got real.
This is exactly what we need.

432
00:30:20,315 --> 00:30:23,149
There's a DA trying to figure out
how to put you in jail.

433
00:30:23,356 --> 00:30:25,870
-Bitch can try.
-I say you go.

434
00:30:29,436 --> 00:30:31,745
People take you for granted.
Make people miss you.

435
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:34,948
-People don't like you, Hancock.
-I do.

436
00:30:35,156 --> 00:30:38,034
Two weeks, you know?
The public will be clamouring for you.

437
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,794
When they do, we'll be ready.

438
00:30:39,996 --> 00:30:43,466
Worst-case scenario is I'm wrong and
you just, you know, fly out of there.

439
00:30:44,316 --> 00:30:45,829
What do you got to lose?

440
00:31:03,836 --> 00:31:06,430
"l apologise to the people
of Los Angeles.

441
00:31:06,636 --> 00:31:09,992
My behaviour has been improper,
and I accept the consequences.

442
00:31:10,476 --> 00:31:12,706
I ask my fellow Angelenos...

443
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:14,747
...for their patience
and understanding. "

444
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,345
You're an asshole, Hancock!

445
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:18,511
Asshole!

446
00:31:21,356 --> 00:31:23,586
"Life here can be difficult for me.

447
00:31:23,796 --> 00:31:25,787
After all, I'm the only one of my kind.

448
00:31:27,516 --> 00:31:29,825
During my incarceration,
I will be participating...

449
00:31:30,036 --> 00:31:32,152
...in alcohol-
and anger-management treatment. "

450
00:31:38,876 --> 00:31:39,945
You're a drunk bum!

451
00:31:40,156 --> 00:31:43,114
"You deserve better from me.
I can be better. I will be better."

452
00:31:43,316 --> 00:31:45,068
All right.

453
00:31:49,796 --> 00:31:52,435
Good morning, ladies.
Welcome to your new home....

454
00:31:54,396 --> 00:31:55,875
It is the duty of each of you...

455
00:31:56,076 --> 00:31:59,273
...to remember
your inmate serial number.

456
00:31:59,636 --> 00:32:01,513
Turn to your right.

457
00:32:03,636 --> 00:32:04,751
Turn to your left.

458
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,629
Okay, scumbags. Let's go.

459
00:32:13,357 --> 00:32:15,552
Give me the hand, playboy.

460
00:32:33,877 --> 00:32:35,868
I see you, punk!

461
00:32:54,717 --> 00:32:56,435
Oh, I get it.

462
00:32:56,637 --> 00:32:59,868
I put some-- Most of you in here.

463
00:33:00,077 --> 00:33:01,954
Yes, you did.

464
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,511
I can understand you feeling
some kind of way about that.

465
00:33:08,717 --> 00:33:10,116
What?

466
00:33:11,037 --> 00:33:15,235
So I'm gonna do me
and I'm gonna let you do you.

467
00:33:15,837 --> 00:33:17,475
I don't want no trouble.

468
00:33:18,237 --> 00:33:19,875
All right?

469
00:33:20,077 --> 00:33:21,954
I just wanna go to my cell.

470
00:33:22,157 --> 00:33:24,830
-That ain't gonna happen.
-Nope.

471
00:33:25,317 --> 00:33:27,194
Excuse me.

472
00:33:29,157 --> 00:33:31,796
Excuse me, please.

473
00:33:35,117 --> 00:33:36,994
Deadly.

474
00:33:37,837 --> 00:33:41,227
If you don't move,
your head is going up his ass.

475
00:33:48,917 --> 00:33:50,828
Y'all fellas sure you wanna
ride this train?

476
00:33:51,357 --> 00:33:53,666
Choo, choo, asshole.

477
00:34:09,238 --> 00:34:11,468
Get him out! Get him out!

478
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:20,590
Did you shove a man's head
up another man's ass?

479
00:34:27,318 --> 00:34:29,513
We're gonna--
We're gonna circle back to that.

480
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:32,912
The DA's office wants your sentence
to run eight years.

481
00:34:33,118 --> 00:34:36,076
It's a big number, but not something
we didn't anticipate.

482
00:34:36,278 --> 00:34:38,189
You know, our plan is--
What are you doing?

483
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:41,356
Hey, hey, hey!

484
00:34:45,998 --> 00:34:50,514
It sounded like you said they want me
to spend eight years in this shithole.

485
00:34:50,718 --> 00:34:53,232
Eight is more like four and a half
with good behaviour.

486
00:34:53,598 --> 00:34:57,352
But it's irrelevant because
with you out of the picture...

487
00:34:57,558 --> 00:35:00,026
...and with the crime rate
going up through the roof...

488
00:35:00,238 --> 00:35:01,796
...the DA and the cops...

489
00:35:01,998 --> 00:35:03,954
...they're all gonna call
for your immediate release.

490
00:35:04,198 --> 00:35:06,666
They're gonna demand it.
Where are you going? Sit down.

491
00:35:06,878 --> 00:35:09,346
Hey. Hey. Stop right there.

492
00:35:09,558 --> 00:35:10,673
-Stop it. Hancock.
-Move.

493
00:35:10,878 --> 00:35:12,277
-Hancock!
-Get back!

494
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:13,957
You're being a coward!

495
00:35:14,758 --> 00:35:16,589
-Who you talking to?
-I'm talking to you.

496
00:35:16,798 --> 00:35:20,473
-Who are you talking to, Ray?
-Stop pretending that you do not care.

497
00:35:20,998 --> 00:35:22,989
You have a calling.
You're a hero, Hancock.

498
00:35:23,198 --> 00:35:26,827
You're gonna be miserable the rest
of your life until you accept that.

499
00:35:27,038 --> 00:35:31,156
Trust me. Trust this plan,
this process. Just stay in here.

500
00:35:31,678 --> 00:35:34,954
When they call, a hero's
what we're gonna give them.

501
00:35:37,118 --> 00:35:38,676
How we gonna do that, Ray?

502
00:35:40,678 --> 00:35:42,669
All right, guys, let's start sharing.

503
00:35:42,878 --> 00:35:44,675
-Don? You had something?
-Yeah.

504
00:35:45,598 --> 00:35:49,751
Yeah, I think I might've had
a little bit of a breakthrough.

505
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,478
Good for you.

506
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:56,270
Yeah, I mean, I realised
that breaking necks is-- It's easy.

507
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:01,633
But I'm sitting there and I'm
staring at myself in the mirror...

508
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,468
-...and I thought, "This is tough."
-Yeah, it sounds tough.

509
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,748
Why do you always laugh?

510
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:11,156
Picturing you looking at the mirror.
It would scare the shit out of me.

511
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:14,994
Every time I'm talking,
he completely ruins the cycle.

512
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,592
Now, let's watch the crosstalk.

513
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,154
I'm not gonna share anymore
if he keeps doing that.

514
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,508
No, no, no.

515
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:22,675
-Keep sharing.
-Let's move on.

516
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:24,597
Mr. Hancock,
do you wanna share today?

517
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:27,668
Pass.

518
00:36:27,999 --> 00:36:31,309
Your landing is your first impression.
It's your superhero handshake.

519
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:34,671
Don't come in too hot, okay?
Don't come in too boozy.

520
00:36:34,879 --> 00:36:37,154
And don't land on
a $100,000 Mercedes. All right?

521
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,953
People have to be happy
that you've arrived.

522
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:41,993
Mr. Hancock, your share.

523
00:36:42,879 --> 00:36:44,073
Pass.

524
00:36:44,279 --> 00:36:46,839
So you've used the door
and the building's still intact.

525
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,394
People are happy that you've arrived.
They feel safe.

526
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,749
There's an officer
and he's done a good job...

527
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,551
...so tell him he's done a good job.

528
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:56,557
What the hell did I have to come for
if he's done a good job?

529
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:08,108
Oh, man!

530
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:12,110
KBLA radio, AM 850.

531
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:15,629
Today's big story, no surprise here:
Hancock. What's your take?

532
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,557
I, for one, have
had enough of this guy.

533
00:37:17,759 --> 00:37:21,308
I'm glad he's doing time around bars
and I hope they don't let him off easy.

534
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:22,793
Let my cousin Pookie out.

535
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:25,638
"l see you don't wear
a bulletproof vest, security officer.

536
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:26,954
I respect your courage...

537
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:30,435
...because bullets don't bounce
off you, they bounce off me."

538
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,795
This city is being run by gangs
and drug dealers.

539
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,116
Hancock makes them
shake in their boots.

540
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,312
He doesn't tie a pretty ribbon
around it, but he gets the job done.

541
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,675
Besides, he's hot.

542
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,919
Let me hear you say it.
Let me hear you say, "Good job."

543
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,113
G--

544
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,715
Goo--

545
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,474
Mr. Hancock,
would you like to share?

546
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,708
-Pass.
-Good.

547
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,473
Good.

548
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,036
Good j--

549
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,468
Good j--

550
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,468
Good job.

551
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,193
Good job.

552
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,389
Jail watch, day five, and true to his
word, Hancock remains incarcerated.

553
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,477
Meanwhile, crime is still on the rise.

554
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,990
The L.A.P.D. is reporting
increases of up to 30 percent...

555
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,432
... in the last five days
that Hancock has been behind bars.

556
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,360
-Hancock! Hey, Hancock!
-Hey, little buddy.

557
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,313
-Hancock. We brought you something!
-Hey, hey.

558
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,270
Hey, what's up, Hancock?

559
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,993
Where's--? Where's Ray?

560
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,550
No, it's just us. Ray's working.

561
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,637
Aaron really wanted
to come and see you...

562
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,877
...so we just dropped by
with some Spaghetti Madness.

563
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,355
I should probably let the guard
check for keys--

564
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,275
-No, no. Here.
-Okay. Here you go.

565
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,554
Oh, you brought me meatballs, huh?

566
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,231
-Just dig in.
-Oh, man, look at that. Look at that.

567
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,471
-That's a good meatball.
-Thanks, Hancock.

568
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,719
Ray is a good man.

569
00:39:26,561 --> 00:39:28,756
Whatever this is you're doing,
don't let him down.

570
00:39:29,921 --> 00:39:31,639
Okay?

571
00:39:33,921 --> 00:39:36,196
Okay. Well, we should
probably go, buddy.

572
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:39,154
-Already? I wanna stay with Hancock.
-Yeah. Sweetheart...

573
00:39:39,361 --> 00:39:42,034
...we have to go.
Come on, say goodbye to Hancock.

574
00:39:42,241 --> 00:39:45,313
Here, Hancock. It's my favourite one,
and I want you to have it.

575
00:39:45,601 --> 00:39:47,592
-That was very sweet.
-Thanks, Mom.

576
00:39:47,801 --> 00:39:49,280
Come here.

577
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:09,081
Mr. Hancock,
would you like to share?

578
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:10,839
Pass.

579
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,157
All right. Phillip?

580
00:40:15,761 --> 00:40:16,910
I love you guys, man.

581
00:40:17,121 --> 00:40:19,715
-We love you.
-We love you too, Phillip.

582
00:41:06,961 --> 00:41:07,996
For when they call.

583
00:41:13,922 --> 00:41:15,958
-I ain't wearing that, Ray.
-Yes, you are.

584
00:41:16,162 --> 00:41:17,720
-Oh, no, I'm not.
-No, you are.

585
00:41:17,922 --> 00:41:19,071
Actually, I'm not, Ray.

586
00:41:19,282 --> 00:41:20,920
You think you're not, but you are.

587
00:41:21,122 --> 00:41:25,798
I will fight crime butt-ass naked
before I fight it in that, Ray.

588
00:41:26,362 --> 00:41:29,559
You know, you have fought naked.
We've got that. That's on YouTube.

589
00:41:29,762 --> 00:41:33,198
Hancock, this is a uniform.
A uniform represents purpose.

590
00:41:33,402 --> 00:41:35,916
Doctors, policemen, firemen, right?

591
00:41:36,122 --> 00:41:38,511
-lt represents a calling.
-It's been two weeks.

592
00:41:38,722 --> 00:41:41,953
-Yeah?
-Nobody out there is missing me, Ray.

593
00:41:42,242 --> 00:41:45,359
Just be patient.
You gotta trust me on this. All right?

594
00:42:11,202 --> 00:42:13,557
Perimeter breach, perimeter breach.

595
00:42:15,362 --> 00:42:16,397
Asshole!

596
00:42:20,322 --> 00:42:22,438
You're still a fake-ass punk.

597
00:42:37,042 --> 00:42:38,111
Damn!

598
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:39,311
Mr. Hancock?

599
00:42:40,322 --> 00:42:42,278
It's your share.

600
00:42:43,842 --> 00:42:45,639
Pass.

601
00:42:47,642 --> 00:42:51,078
-Come on, man, try it. Let it out.
-Come on, John.

602
00:42:51,282 --> 00:42:52,431
I don't have nothing.

603
00:42:52,682 --> 00:42:55,071
There's nothing on your mind?
Come on, John.

604
00:42:55,282 --> 00:42:56,431
-It's cool, man.
-Come on.

605
00:42:56,642 --> 00:42:57,837
-Come on.
-Do it.

606
00:42:58,043 --> 00:42:59,271
First time for everything.

607
00:42:59,483 --> 00:43:02,520
-Feels good to release, now.
-Let it heal. Come on, man, try it.

608
00:43:02,723 --> 00:43:05,999
Come in here all these days,
you don't have anything to share?

609
00:43:07,603 --> 00:43:12,279
I'm Hancock, and I drink and stuff.

610
00:43:15,243 --> 00:43:16,596
All right. Thanks for sharing.

611
00:43:17,563 --> 00:43:19,474
-Okay.
-Thank you.

612
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,196
-All right.
-That's awesome.

613
00:43:21,403 --> 00:43:24,281
-That's a clap. Yeah.
-There you go. Good share.

614
00:43:39,163 --> 00:43:41,358
Hey, Hancock.

615
00:43:41,563 --> 00:43:43,315
Come on, get up.

616
00:43:43,563 --> 00:43:46,441
-You got a phone call.
-Take a message.

617
00:43:46,643 --> 00:43:48,713
It's the chief of police.

618
00:43:48,923 --> 00:43:51,198
He says he needs your help.

619
00:44:15,523 --> 00:44:18,833
The trapped officer's husband
is Corporal Joseph Blake...

620
00:44:19,043 --> 00:44:20,761
...who was killed last year in lraq...

621
00:44:20,963 --> 00:44:24,239
...Ieaving her two small children.
We are waiting for the latest news...

622
00:44:24,443 --> 00:44:26,832
...but apparently
there are three suspects and....

623
00:44:27,043 --> 00:44:28,237
What's going on?

624
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:31,112
I'm out!

625
00:44:31,803 --> 00:44:34,271
Stay down! Stay down!

626
00:44:34,483 --> 00:44:36,075
Stay down!

627
00:44:36,763 --> 00:44:37,718
-Get out!
-Get down!

628
00:44:37,923 --> 00:44:38,992
Get it down!

629
00:44:44,243 --> 00:44:45,684
Let's go! Everybody's gotta get back!
Let's go!

630
00:44:45,684 --> 00:44:46,833
Let's go! Everybody's gotta get back!
Let's go!

631
00:44:47,044 --> 00:44:49,194
Back! Move!

632
00:45:01,524 --> 00:45:04,914
We got perimeters set up
on the north, east and south sides.

633
00:45:05,124 --> 00:45:06,842
The west side is open.

634
00:45:15,164 --> 00:45:17,598
Don't break the building,
don't break the building.

635
00:45:25,444 --> 00:45:27,002
What?

636
00:45:31,364 --> 00:45:32,922
It's a little tight. What you got?

637
00:45:33,124 --> 00:45:36,912
Bank job. I got at least eight hostages.
Four bad guys.

638
00:45:37,124 --> 00:45:39,160
Officer pinned down.
We can't get to her.

639
00:45:39,364 --> 00:45:43,118
They been spraying
the hell out of us all morning. And--

640
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:46,521
They got some kind of heavy artillery.
Fifty calibre or bigger.

641
00:45:46,724 --> 00:45:50,239
-I don't know if that matters to you.
-No, I'm good.

642
00:45:56,524 --> 00:45:57,718
Good job.

643
00:46:00,004 --> 00:46:01,039
Good job.

644
00:46:01,364 --> 00:46:03,241
Really, good job.

645
00:46:10,804 --> 00:46:11,839
Get down!

646
00:46:40,325 --> 00:46:42,043
It's Hancock!

647
00:46:49,285 --> 00:46:50,320
Take him out!

648
00:46:54,725 --> 00:46:56,443
Good job!

649
00:46:56,645 --> 00:46:58,681
Do I have permission
to touch your body?

650
00:46:58,885 --> 00:47:00,318
Yes!

651
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:03,721
It's not sexual.

652
00:47:05,205 --> 00:47:07,275
Not that you're not
an attractive woman.

653
00:47:07,485 --> 00:47:10,158
-You're a very attractive woman--
-Get me the fuck out of here!

654
00:47:15,405 --> 00:47:16,997
He's on the move!

655
00:47:30,725 --> 00:47:32,636
He's moving, he's moving!

656
00:47:42,085 --> 00:47:43,040
Good job.

657
00:47:43,245 --> 00:47:44,598
-Are you hit anywhere?
-My leg!

658
00:47:44,805 --> 00:47:46,238
-Hancock!
-Good job.

659
00:47:46,445 --> 00:47:48,675
You said that.
I need you to end this now.

660
00:47:57,005 --> 00:47:58,518
Check the flanks.

661
00:48:00,765 --> 00:48:01,834
Secure the perimeter.

662
00:48:05,605 --> 00:48:07,084
Spread out!

663
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:09,241
They're gonna
come around the back.

664
00:48:21,846 --> 00:48:22,801
What happened to him?

665
00:48:24,646 --> 00:48:27,479
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

666
00:48:33,086 --> 00:48:35,805
What is happening?

667
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:52,599
-I heard you was in the slammer.
-Out early.

668
00:48:52,806 --> 00:48:55,320
-Why's that?
-Good behaviour.

669
00:48:56,246 --> 00:48:57,725
Do you know what this is?

670
00:49:00,926 --> 00:49:04,999
I'm guessing it's
some kind of detonator-type deal.

671
00:49:05,206 --> 00:49:08,403
There's 8 pounds of C-4 strapped
to each and every one of them.

672
00:49:08,606 --> 00:49:10,562
This is a spring-loaded
dead man's switch.

673
00:49:10,766 --> 00:49:12,279
If my thumb comes off it:

674
00:49:15,406 --> 00:49:18,523
And now, since we've had
a little change of plan...

675
00:49:18,726 --> 00:49:20,284
...between the police showing up...

676
00:49:20,486 --> 00:49:22,681
...and you sucking out
all of my associates...

677
00:49:22,886 --> 00:49:24,922
...I want you to break into the vault.

678
00:49:25,246 --> 00:49:28,204
You'll find three quarter-ton pallets
of small bills inside.

679
00:49:28,606 --> 00:49:29,880
Thirty million dollars.

680
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,678
And you're gonna carry it for me.

681
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:36,674
You are gonna get me safely
away from here with the money...

682
00:49:36,926 --> 00:49:40,999
...or else they'll be cleaning up
these hostages with a mop.

683
00:49:44,046 --> 00:49:45,798
I'm gonna have to say no to that.

684
00:49:48,806 --> 00:49:50,683
I'm really trying
to turn over a new leaf.

685
00:49:50,886 --> 00:49:53,446
I will blow up this entire building,
you asshole.

686
00:49:56,486 --> 00:49:58,681
I really don't like that word.

687
00:49:58,886 --> 00:50:00,717
I will blow them sky-high...

688
00:50:00,926 --> 00:50:03,486
...and their blood
will be on your hands.

689
00:50:06,926 --> 00:50:08,918
Do you hear me, asshole?

690
00:50:17,287 --> 00:50:19,642
Call me a asshole...

691
00:50:20,047 --> 00:50:21,446
...one more time.

692
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:26,039
Ass--

693
00:50:30,767 --> 00:50:32,962
-Go, go, go. Move in!
-Go on, you're safe!

694
00:50:33,167 --> 00:50:35,442
-Let's go. Let's go.
-Take it right in. Let's go.

695
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:37,558
Bring it around now.

696
00:50:58,167 --> 00:50:59,759
Keep your hand on that trigger.

697
00:51:00,447 --> 00:51:03,803
-Good job.
-No. You, good job.

698
00:51:06,047 --> 00:51:07,958
-Thank you.
-Good job.

699
00:51:09,607 --> 00:51:11,837
Hancock!

700
00:52:04,048 --> 00:52:06,846
Say hi to your fans.
Look what you got.

701
00:52:07,568 --> 00:52:09,047
Here we go. This way.

702
00:52:09,248 --> 00:52:12,604
-Hancock. At the bank today, intense.
-Thank you.

703
00:52:12,808 --> 00:52:14,526
Smile.

704
00:52:14,728 --> 00:52:15,763
Good job, Hancock!

705
00:52:18,248 --> 00:52:20,125
Hey. Boy, they'll let anybody
in here, huh?

706
00:52:20,328 --> 00:52:24,116
Hancock, meet these guys. This is
Mike Kilbourne and Jeremy Himmel.

707
00:52:24,328 --> 00:52:25,727
Gigantic fans. Insane!

708
00:52:25,928 --> 00:52:27,998
These guys are partners
at the biggest ad firm.

709
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:29,436
You never call, man.

710
00:52:29,648 --> 00:52:33,527
-I have called. A couple of times.
-Water under the bridge, man.

711
00:52:36,368 --> 00:52:39,280
Could you guys
get used to this or what?

712
00:52:41,128 --> 00:52:42,766
How'd you two meet?

713
00:52:44,608 --> 00:52:46,041
I was married once before.

714
00:52:46,248 --> 00:52:48,239
First wife...

715
00:52:49,328 --> 00:52:52,001
...she died giving birth to Aaron.

716
00:52:52,648 --> 00:52:56,721
It's another dinner. But.... But....

717
00:52:56,968 --> 00:52:59,323
So there I am, I'm with
this beautiful little baby.

718
00:52:59,528 --> 00:53:01,246
I don't know what the hell to do.

719
00:53:01,448 --> 00:53:03,518
And I was in the supermarket...

720
00:53:04,288 --> 00:53:06,040
...and I'm in the baby aisle...

721
00:53:06,248 --> 00:53:08,716
...and I've got
a brand of diapers in each hand.

722
00:53:08,928 --> 00:53:12,637
I'm staring at them, but I don't know
how I'm gonna get through the day.

723
00:53:13,928 --> 00:53:14,997
An angel...

724
00:53:16,408 --> 00:53:18,399
...sees me.

725
00:53:20,168 --> 00:53:22,841
She knew. She was--
She gave me this look.

726
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:29,203
And even in the trance I was in,
I knew that somebody somewhere...

727
00:53:29,408 --> 00:53:31,319
...was throwing me a little rope.

728
00:53:32,048 --> 00:53:33,083
You know?

729
00:53:33,288 --> 00:53:37,076
Starting that day, you really
put my life back together. Right?

730
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:42,002
-You're drunk.
-So? Come here.

731
00:53:47,049 --> 00:53:48,562
What about you, buddy?

732
00:53:48,769 --> 00:53:50,566
You're from another planet,
aren't you?

733
00:53:51,529 --> 00:53:52,803
No, man, I'm from Miami.

734
00:53:53,009 --> 00:53:55,284
You didn't come in on,
like, a meteor or--?

735
00:53:55,489 --> 00:53:57,878
Nope. Woke up in a hospital,
first thing I remember.

736
00:53:58,089 --> 00:54:01,877
Government hospital, yes?
Experimenting on you and--

737
00:54:02,249 --> 00:54:05,719
No, Ray. Regular old
Miami emergency room.

738
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:09,128
-Come on.
-My skull was fractured.

739
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:12,765
They told me
I tried to stop a mugging.

740
00:54:12,969 --> 00:54:17,042
-Somebody knocked you out.
-I guess I was a regular guy before...

741
00:54:17,249 --> 00:54:20,286
...and when I woke up,
I was changed.

742
00:54:21,449 --> 00:54:23,917
The hospital nurse tried
to put a needle in my arm...

743
00:54:24,129 --> 00:54:26,245
...and it just broke against my skin.

744
00:54:26,489 --> 00:54:30,004
And then my skull healed
in, like, an hour.

745
00:54:30,209 --> 00:54:33,565
The doctors were astounded...

746
00:54:33,769 --> 00:54:37,398
...and they wanted to know my story.

747
00:54:37,609 --> 00:54:41,124
Just like you. But I couldn't tell them.
I don't know who I am.

748
00:54:42,049 --> 00:54:43,846
Amnesia.

749
00:54:44,329 --> 00:54:47,799
-You know, the blow to the head.
-Yeah, well, that's what they figured.

750
00:54:48,289 --> 00:54:51,486
-You don't remember anything?
-No.

751
00:54:52,649 --> 00:54:55,322
Only thing I had in my pocket was...

752
00:54:55,529 --> 00:54:57,360
...bubblegum...

753
00:54:57,569 --> 00:54:59,525
...two movie tickets.

754
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:03,165
Boris Karloff, Frankenstein.

755
00:55:03,689 --> 00:55:06,487
But no lD, nothing.

756
00:55:06,689 --> 00:55:11,160
I went to sign out, the nurse
asked me for my John Hancock.

757
00:55:12,969 --> 00:55:14,641
I actually thought that's who I was.

758
00:55:15,809 --> 00:55:17,401
How come I didn't hear any of this...

759
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:19,440
...didn't read about it
in any newspapers?

760
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:22,846
It was probably in the papers
80 years ago.

761
00:55:23,409 --> 00:55:24,808
Eighty years ago?

762
00:55:25,049 --> 00:55:27,165
Oh, I don't age. This is it.

763
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:30,042
-That's nice.
-Gotta wonder, though:

764
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:35,487
What kind of bastard
must I have been...

765
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:41,080
...that nobody was there to claim me?

766
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:49,403
I mean, I'm not the most
charming guy in the world...

767
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:51,885
...so I've been told, but...

768
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:55,802
...nobody?

769
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:12,239
Whoever it was they'd be dead
by now, anyway.

770
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:15,438
Hey.

771
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:18,289
Hey, Mary. You all right, baby?

772
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:22,039
Yeah. Too much wine.

773
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:24,560
I am a lightweight.

774
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:32,281
I'm sorry.

775
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:37,567
You ain't do nothing.

776
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:43,609
This was a nice dinner, Ray.

777
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:50,209
-lt was a good one.
-Almost call this fun.

778
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:56,966
That didn't tire you out,
coming up the stairs?

779
00:56:57,170 --> 00:56:59,161
-Not really.
-I'm real spinny.

780
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:02,123
Could've just flown me upstairs.

781
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:04,844
-I could've done without that.
-Get your shoes off here.

782
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:08,247
All right, that's all you're
getting off of me though.

783
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:13,963
You believe in me,
don't you, Hancock?

784
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:17,118
-Of course, Ray. I believe in you.
-Help me up here.

785
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:19,241
I got something to say to you.

786
00:57:20,331 --> 00:57:22,720
Listen to me. This is important.

787
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:27,801
You are like a Dodger Dog.

788
00:57:28,371 --> 00:57:30,566
It's something people don't think
they're gonna like...

789
00:57:30,771 --> 00:57:33,126
...then they try it and they love it,
right? It hits the spot.

790
00:57:33,331 --> 00:57:36,050
It's good for the soul.
You're like the world's Dodger Dog.

791
00:57:36,251 --> 00:57:38,287
I don't know.
But you know what I mean, right?

792
00:57:41,171 --> 00:57:42,604
You're gonna do great.

793
00:57:45,051 --> 00:57:46,769
You're gonna fix everything.

794
00:57:50,851 --> 00:57:54,446
-You get some sleep, Ray.
-You sleep tight too.

795
00:57:55,211 --> 00:57:57,566
Hancock tucking me in.

796
00:58:08,931 --> 00:58:11,126
All right, he's asleep.

797
00:58:15,051 --> 00:58:18,088
-Okay, thanks. Good night.
-Good night.

798
00:58:23,811 --> 00:58:28,646
Look, I just don't want you
to think that-- That Ray...

799
00:58:28,851 --> 00:58:30,603
...you know, drinks like that,
because--

800
00:58:30,811 --> 00:58:32,927
-Oh, no.
-This was just kind of...

801
00:58:33,131 --> 00:58:34,962
-...a celebratory night.
-No, I understand.

802
00:58:35,171 --> 00:58:38,004
-Yeah, I know that.
-Okay.

803
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:44,127
The damn babysitter
never cleans up after herself.

804
00:59:02,291 --> 00:59:04,202
You have a bruise on your hand.

805
00:59:04,411 --> 00:59:07,324
Yeah, I don't--
I don't know what that is.

806
00:59:08,932 --> 00:59:11,366
I've been feeling kind of funny.

807
00:59:15,292 --> 00:59:16,964
You--

808
00:59:17,932 --> 00:59:19,160
You should go.

809
00:59:24,532 --> 00:59:26,443
Getting late.

810
01:00:15,652 --> 01:00:17,051
If Ray finds out about me...

811
01:00:19,332 --> 01:00:21,084
...you're dead.

812
01:01:05,613 --> 01:01:09,731
Joan, we're gonna take care
of that, okay? Don't you worry.

813
01:01:11,693 --> 01:01:13,411
Hi, honey.

814
01:01:13,613 --> 01:01:15,490
Breakfast?

815
01:01:15,893 --> 01:01:18,361
Hancock sneezed, huh?

816
01:01:18,573 --> 01:01:21,565
Can you believe it? It's amazing
that you slept through that.

817
01:01:21,773 --> 01:01:24,446
-You're a good sleeper.
-Holy shit.

818
01:01:24,813 --> 01:01:27,930
I'm not gonna say
I told you so, but....

819
01:01:28,493 --> 01:01:31,053
You told me he was gonna sneeze
a hole through the house?

820
01:01:31,293 --> 01:01:32,612
I just said him being around--

821
01:01:32,813 --> 01:01:34,883
Oh, sweetheart, can you get that?
Thanks.

822
01:01:35,133 --> 01:01:37,408
-Oh, God, you strong man.
-I got it.

823
01:01:37,613 --> 01:01:39,763
But you don't worry about anything.

824
01:01:39,973 --> 01:01:43,124
I already apologised to the neighbours.
Called State Farm.

825
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:44,686
Everything is taken care of.

826
01:01:45,413 --> 01:01:47,005
You just...

827
01:01:48,213 --> 01:01:50,932
...enjoy that breakfast.

828
01:01:52,693 --> 01:01:55,332
What's this?
Are we going on vacation? Are we?

829
01:01:55,533 --> 01:01:56,648
Just the three of us.

830
01:01:56,853 --> 01:01:58,206
-End of the summer?
-Tonight.

831
01:01:58,453 --> 01:02:00,444
-Tonight?
-Spur of the moment.

832
01:02:00,653 --> 01:02:03,963
-Tonight might be a little tough.
-Come on. The three of us?

833
01:02:04,173 --> 01:02:05,925
Me in a bikini?

834
01:02:06,133 --> 01:02:07,566
-Sounds good.
-Let's go somewhere.

835
01:02:07,773 --> 01:02:09,411
Knock, knock.

836
01:02:10,973 --> 01:02:12,725
Gesundheit.

837
01:02:13,453 --> 01:02:17,731
I was just telling Ray here,
I hope you're done sneezing...

838
01:02:17,933 --> 01:02:21,289
...because I don't think
our house could take much more...

839
01:02:21,493 --> 01:02:22,972
...of your sneezing.

840
01:02:28,973 --> 01:02:32,807
Yeah, sometimes
I sneeze when there's dust...

841
01:02:35,253 --> 01:02:37,244
...or if I get really surprised.

842
01:02:38,533 --> 01:02:41,411
That's unfortunate.
This is Kilbourne.

843
01:02:42,253 --> 01:02:44,529
Mike? How you doing?

844
01:02:45,214 --> 01:02:47,523
It was great to see you too.

845
01:02:47,734 --> 01:02:48,814
Yep. Well....

846
01:02:48,814 --> 01:02:50,770
Yep. Well....

847
01:02:51,014 --> 01:02:53,244
Right. Go ahead, shoot.

848
01:02:54,534 --> 01:02:57,287
Okay. I got a pen right here.

849
01:02:57,614 --> 01:03:00,174
Right. No, I know.

850
01:03:05,054 --> 01:03:07,090
It's right here in my hand.

851
01:03:14,334 --> 01:03:16,290
I am warning you.

852
01:03:16,494 --> 01:03:17,643
All right, go ahead.

853
01:03:21,094 --> 01:03:22,129
Okay, good.

854
01:03:23,054 --> 01:03:27,445
Now.... And that's still in 310, right?

855
01:03:27,654 --> 01:03:28,723
Hang on one second.

856
01:03:29,574 --> 01:03:30,768
Do me a favour...?

857
01:03:31,694 --> 01:03:34,766
I'm sorry, Mike. Yeah.

858
01:03:34,974 --> 01:03:36,726
We're gonna talk.

859
01:03:36,934 --> 01:03:39,687
Go away.

860
01:03:39,894 --> 01:03:43,603
Well, it is something
that I'm really excited about.

861
01:03:54,614 --> 01:03:57,492
-I'm gonna do this all day.
-Shut-- Shut up.

862
01:03:59,814 --> 01:04:01,213
I-- I suppose....

863
01:04:01,414 --> 01:04:03,609
-Fine. We'll talk, okay?
-We will.

864
01:04:03,854 --> 01:04:05,003
And when we're done talking...

865
01:04:05,214 --> 01:04:08,445
...you go away
and you leave my family alone.

866
01:04:09,574 --> 01:04:12,486
-My place at 4:00.
-Whatever.

867
01:04:13,454 --> 01:04:16,685
It means.... Well, I'd rather not
talk numbers now.

868
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:19,806
I'd like to save them for the pitch.
So let's just set a time.

869
01:04:20,014 --> 01:04:22,892
That's good with me.
I will see you then. All right.

870
01:04:23,094 --> 01:04:25,847
Yeah, 3:30. Great.

871
01:04:26,174 --> 01:04:28,483
Hon, is it hot in here?

872
01:04:48,935 --> 01:04:51,927
He hurt you, didn't he?

873
01:04:52,895 --> 01:04:55,284
Come on, use your words.

874
01:04:55,495 --> 01:04:57,884
How did it make you feel?

875
01:05:00,655 --> 01:05:01,770
Sore.

876
01:05:02,495 --> 01:05:03,484
Bad.

877
01:05:04,535 --> 01:05:05,524
Bad.

878
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:09,728
It's because he took your power.
And you have to get your power back.

879
01:05:11,215 --> 01:05:15,413
And no one will give you your power
back. You have to go out and take it.

880
01:05:15,615 --> 01:05:17,606
You understand me?

881
01:05:19,255 --> 01:05:21,086
We're gonna go find Hancock...

882
01:05:22,615 --> 01:05:24,890
...and get your power back.

883
01:05:55,015 --> 01:05:56,243
Well, I'm here.

884
01:05:57,255 --> 01:05:58,688
Yup.

885
01:06:04,175 --> 01:06:07,326
-You wanna do it?
-Do what?

886
01:06:10,775 --> 01:06:12,925
I don't have time for this, okay?
You ask the questions...

887
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:14,966
...I answer them honestly
and then you leave L.A.

888
01:06:15,175 --> 01:06:16,654
I ain't leaving L.A.

889
01:06:19,136 --> 01:06:22,014
All right, all right. Jeez.

890
01:06:24,096 --> 01:06:25,495
Don't.

891
01:06:37,256 --> 01:06:38,848
Ask.

892
01:06:40,776 --> 01:06:42,368
-You and l.
-"You and l" what?

893
01:06:42,576 --> 01:06:45,170
-We're the same.
-No.

894
01:06:46,016 --> 01:06:47,415
I'm stronger.

895
01:06:48,216 --> 01:06:49,535
Really?

896
01:06:52,336 --> 01:06:53,894
Oh, yeah.

897
01:06:55,056 --> 01:06:56,614
Who are we?

898
01:06:56,856 --> 01:07:01,372
Gods, angels. Different cultures
call us by different names.

899
01:07:01,576 --> 01:07:04,454
Now all of a sudden, it's "superhero."

900
01:07:04,656 --> 01:07:08,092
-Are there more of us?
-There were.

901
01:07:08,456 --> 01:07:09,525
They all died.

902
01:07:11,536 --> 01:07:13,527
It's just the two of us.

903
01:07:22,216 --> 01:07:23,251
What is this?

904
01:07:27,136 --> 01:07:28,615
Who are we to each other?

905
01:07:29,776 --> 01:07:31,653
-We're brother and sister.
-That's a lie.

906
01:07:33,136 --> 01:07:34,774
-No, I'm your sister.
-That is a lie.

907
01:07:34,976 --> 01:07:36,568
-I'm your sister.
-That is a lie.

908
01:07:36,776 --> 01:07:39,734
Sisters don't kiss brothers
the way you kissed me last night.

909
01:07:39,936 --> 01:07:41,164
You're lying, deal's off.

910
01:07:41,376 --> 01:07:43,332
Let's go see
how Ray feels about this.

911
01:07:43,536 --> 01:07:45,572
Get your ass back here!

912
01:07:45,776 --> 01:07:47,573
I'm telling!

913
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:55,011
The AllHeart symbol
will be known globally...

914
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:57,095
...as a symbol...

915
01:07:57,336 --> 01:08:01,966
...that represents companies that
are committed to changing the world.

916
01:08:02,176 --> 01:08:04,451
They can give away
their sustenance goods, okay?

917
01:08:04,656 --> 01:08:06,852
Food, drugs, power, clothing,
for free.

918
01:08:07,057 --> 01:08:09,287
-We were talking about Hancock--
-Number two.

919
01:08:20,177 --> 01:08:21,895
You stay away
from me and my family.

920
01:08:22,097 --> 01:08:24,372
You are not gonna
do this to me again.

921
01:08:24,577 --> 01:08:27,455
What? I don't know
what you're talking about.

922
01:08:27,657 --> 01:08:29,488
-Hey!
-I love you, Hancock!

923
01:08:29,697 --> 01:08:33,007
It can't work.
It always ends the same way.

924
01:08:33,217 --> 01:08:35,572
Persia. Greece. Brooklyn.

925
01:08:35,777 --> 01:08:37,415
Brooklyn?
I've never been to Brooklyn.

926
01:08:37,777 --> 01:08:40,211
I have put up with your bullshit
for 3000 years...

927
01:08:40,417 --> 01:08:42,214
...and I am done!
Done, you listening?

928
01:08:42,417 --> 01:08:44,328
I don't know
what you're talking about!

929
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:45,526
Finally, I am happy!

930
01:08:45,737 --> 01:08:47,170
You are not gonna mess with that!

931
01:08:47,377 --> 01:08:49,174
I don't know
what you're talking about!

932
01:08:49,377 --> 01:08:51,732
I hate to burst
your little crazy-lady bubble...

933
01:08:52,057 --> 01:08:56,369
...but it must not have been all that
great because I don't remember you.

934
01:09:01,217 --> 01:09:03,447
Call me crazy...

935
01:09:04,897 --> 01:09:06,694
...one more time.

936
01:09:06,977 --> 01:09:08,205
Cuckoo.

937
01:09:17,137 --> 01:09:18,536
All right, hold it. All right.

938
01:09:19,137 --> 01:09:21,776
You better not hit me with that truck.

939
01:09:22,497 --> 01:09:26,046
For companies to qualify, they need to
prove they are a leader in the global--

940
01:09:26,257 --> 01:09:27,815
We wanna talk about Mr. Hancock.

941
01:09:28,017 --> 01:09:29,848
They're committed
to bettering the world.

942
01:09:30,057 --> 01:09:32,332
They can do this in four ways.
This is how they....

943
01:10:13,298 --> 01:10:16,051
The most important thing
with AllHeart is brand recognition.

944
01:10:16,258 --> 01:10:18,055
I've mocked up
these examples here...

945
01:10:18,258 --> 01:10:20,135
...in Tokyo, London, Dubai, Paris.

946
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:33,096
Oh, no.

947
01:10:33,618 --> 01:10:35,495
We need maximum exposure,
market penetra--

948
01:10:35,738 --> 01:10:36,693
Is it snowing?

949
01:10:50,898 --> 01:10:52,456
Stop. Stop it.

950
01:10:52,658 --> 01:10:55,297
Stop. Stop. Stop!
All right, let's just--

951
01:10:55,498 --> 01:10:56,567
Get off me!

952
01:11:02,978 --> 01:11:04,570
Get off me!

953
01:11:05,458 --> 01:11:06,857
Stop. Stop!

954
01:11:07,058 --> 01:11:08,571
Get off!

955
01:11:08,778 --> 01:11:09,927
-Get off me!
-Listen to me!

956
01:11:10,138 --> 01:11:12,447
-I hate you!
-I am sorry!

957
01:11:16,018 --> 01:11:20,136
Whoever I am, whatever I did--
Look at me.

958
01:11:21,058 --> 01:11:22,935
--I'm sorry.

959
01:11:23,378 --> 01:11:25,289
I don't remember.

960
01:11:26,258 --> 01:11:28,488
You are the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

961
01:11:38,658 --> 01:11:40,330
Oh, my God.

962
01:12:28,779 --> 01:12:31,896
Why were you flying?
You were flying, Mary.

963
01:12:32,979 --> 01:12:35,652
-Yeah, she was definitely flying, Ray.
-Okay, I was flying.

964
01:12:36,779 --> 01:12:39,247
And I'm very strong as well.

965
01:12:39,459 --> 01:12:40,892
-It's just the way we are.
-"We"?

966
01:12:41,099 --> 01:12:44,011
Me and him, it's just us now.
The others paired up and died.

967
01:12:44,219 --> 01:12:46,972
You didn't say anything
about pairing up at the trailer.

968
01:12:47,219 --> 01:12:49,653
-You were at his trailer.
-This is hard to explain.

969
01:12:49,859 --> 01:12:51,178
-Great, I'm all ears.
-Me too.

970
01:12:51,379 --> 01:12:54,018
Do me a favour, just give me
and my wife one moment.

971
01:12:54,219 --> 01:12:56,528
-Don't bring it here, Ray.
-The adults are talking.

972
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:58,297
Technically speaking...

973
01:13:00,179 --> 01:13:01,214
...he's my husband.

974
01:13:02,379 --> 01:13:04,688
Holy shit.

975
01:13:05,139 --> 01:13:07,778
-What?
-We broke up decades ago.

976
01:13:07,979 --> 01:13:10,777
Long before you were born.
He just can't remember.

977
01:13:10,979 --> 01:13:13,937
But you can, right? You knew?

978
01:13:14,139 --> 01:13:16,494
That's something you bring up
on a first date, Mary.

979
01:13:16,699 --> 01:13:19,816
"l don't like to travel.
I'm allergic to cats. I'm immortal."

980
01:13:20,019 --> 01:13:22,294
Those are some things
you give a heads-up on.

981
01:13:22,499 --> 01:13:24,729
Whatever we are,
we were built in twos, okay?

982
01:13:24,939 --> 01:13:26,213
We're drawn to each other.

983
01:13:26,419 --> 01:13:28,649
No matter how far I run,
he's always there.

984
01:13:28,859 --> 01:13:30,373
He finds me. It's physics.

985
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:33,140
Are you saying that you two
are fated to be together?

986
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:36,138
I've lived for a very long time, Ray.

987
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:38,132
And the one thing I learned...

988
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:40,979
...fate doesn't decide everything.

989
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:42,859
People get to choose.

990
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:45,210
And you chose...

991
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:48,617
...to let me think I was here alone.

992
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:00,169
I didn't think you'd miss
what you didn't remember.

993
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:03,970
Great. Now what?

994
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:11,255
I didn't plan for this.

995
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:34,619
Prison authorities confirmed...

996
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:38,335
... that the prisoner uprising was led
by Kenneth "Red" Parker, Jr...

997
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:41,697
... who was also the leader of last
week's Spring Street bank robbery.

998
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:44,090
At least eight prisoners
are not accounted for.

999
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:46,456
More information
on the prison riot in Norwalk.

1000
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:49,732
Construction workers at the prison
were knocked unconscious.

1001
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:51,851
The prisoners stole
the workers' clothes...

1002
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:54,620
...and it's feared at least
some of them have escaped.

1003
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:56,936
Parker is considered
a criminal mastermind.

1004
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:59,700
He is very effective at
using psychological persuasion...

1005
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:02,255
... to organise criminals
from different backgrounds.

1006
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:05,258
He is a former psychology professor
from Stanford University.

1007
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:08,020
While there, he organised
a notorious criminal network...

1008
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:10,450
... comprised of graduate students
from diverse....

1009
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:12,616
Ninety-one ten.

1010
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:15,015
Ninety-one ten?
You gotta be shitting me.

1011
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:16,814
Ninety-one ten.

1012
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:19,330
Highway robbery.

1013
01:15:42,221 --> 01:15:44,496
-What?
-I'm taking the money.

1014
01:15:51,181 --> 01:15:52,216
I can relate to that.

1015
01:15:54,581 --> 01:15:57,254
You know? If you want something...

1016
01:15:58,181 --> 01:16:01,093
...nobody can stop you
from taking it...

1017
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:04,257
...you just take it, right?

1018
01:16:05,941 --> 01:16:07,659
I like that.

1019
01:16:08,821 --> 01:16:09,936
But can you take it?

1020
01:16:12,941 --> 01:16:15,739
My Zagnut bar versus your gun.

1021
01:16:22,621 --> 01:16:23,895
Sorry about your window.

1022
01:17:09,382 --> 01:17:11,054
-I need Room 1020.
-Clear!

1023
01:17:11,262 --> 01:17:12,661
I need Room 1020.

1024
01:17:15,862 --> 01:17:19,775
I need lV line, blood quality,
CBC, electrolytes, a PT, and--

1025
01:17:19,982 --> 01:17:21,415
Where's his lV line?

1026
01:17:21,822 --> 01:17:23,813
-That's not gonna work.
-I'm in.

1027
01:17:25,262 --> 01:17:26,615
What's happening?

1028
01:17:29,462 --> 01:17:32,260
This just in.
John Hancock has been rushed...

1029
01:17:32,462 --> 01:17:34,100
... to Los Angeles General Hospital.

1030
01:17:34,302 --> 01:17:37,339
Hancock is in serious condition
with multiple gunshot wounds.

1031
01:17:37,542 --> 01:17:39,578
No story yet as to
how this happened to him...

1032
01:17:39,782 --> 01:17:43,570
...but we will continue to cover this
story live. Reporting live from L.A....

1033
01:17:49,662 --> 01:17:52,415
-Any lead on the assailant?
-Mr. Embrey!

1034
01:17:52,622 --> 01:17:54,533
Just a couple of questions,
sir, please.

1035
01:17:54,742 --> 01:17:56,414
Can you describe how it happened?

1036
01:17:56,622 --> 01:17:59,819
From what I've heard,
he was trying to stop a robbery.

1037
01:18:00,022 --> 01:18:03,458
Do you know if special ammunition
was used in the gun that shot him?

1038
01:18:03,662 --> 01:18:04,731
Not that I'm aware of.

1039
01:18:04,982 --> 01:18:07,212
Could this have to do
with the mysterious woman?

1040
01:18:07,422 --> 01:18:10,016
-He was seen battling her.
-I do not have that answer.

1041
01:18:10,262 --> 01:18:13,220
Could this woman
be more powerful than Hancock?

1042
01:18:16,022 --> 01:18:18,741
Here are the lab results for 209.

1043
01:18:45,382 --> 01:18:47,100
You're becoming mortal.

1044
01:18:48,702 --> 01:18:50,454
It's us...

1045
01:18:50,942 --> 01:18:53,012
...being close to each other.

1046
01:18:53,783 --> 01:18:56,775
It's never happened this fast before.

1047
01:18:59,303 --> 01:19:00,622
You have to leave.

1048
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:04,542
The further you get from me,
the better you're gonna feel.

1049
01:19:04,743 --> 01:19:07,211
You'll start getting
your powers back...

1050
01:19:07,463 --> 01:19:10,136
...and be flying and breaking things...

1051
01:19:10,343 --> 01:19:12,811
...and saving people
before you know it.

1052
01:19:26,623 --> 01:19:30,821
Well, it's like I said,
we were built in pairs.

1053
01:19:31,023 --> 01:19:35,733
And when we get close to
our opposites, we lose our power.

1054
01:19:37,903 --> 01:19:42,215
-Why?
-So we can live human lives.

1055
01:19:42,583 --> 01:19:45,143
Love, connect...

1056
01:19:46,303 --> 01:19:50,057
...grow old, die.

1057
01:19:51,103 --> 01:19:53,776
What happened to us?

1058
01:19:57,823 --> 01:19:59,814
Summer of 4 B.C.

1059
01:20:00,743 --> 01:20:03,735
We were becoming mortal, like now.

1060
01:20:04,263 --> 01:20:06,379
They came after me with swords.

1061
01:20:09,663 --> 01:20:11,574
But you saved me.

1062
01:20:15,103 --> 01:20:17,333
1850.

1063
01:20:17,783 --> 01:20:19,614
They set our house on fire.

1064
01:20:20,743 --> 01:20:23,496
You pulled me out of the flames.

1065
01:20:25,543 --> 01:20:27,738
Eighty years ago.

1066
01:20:28,663 --> 01:20:30,699
What happened then?

1067
01:20:31,263 --> 01:20:33,777
We were living in Miami...

1068
01:20:34,303 --> 01:20:37,534
...and a new movie
was playing in town.

1069
01:20:37,743 --> 01:20:38,732
Frankenstein.

1070
01:20:41,944 --> 01:20:43,935
And after...

1071
01:20:44,424 --> 01:20:46,142
...we walked down Flagler Street...

1072
01:20:46,344 --> 01:20:50,098
...and you took my hand,
and you held it so tight.

1073
01:20:56,344 --> 01:20:59,097
And they attacked us in an alley.

1074
01:21:02,624 --> 01:21:06,697
They hit you so hard.
There was so much blood.

1075
01:21:07,744 --> 01:21:10,941
They wouldn't let me ride
in the ambulance with you.

1076
01:21:11,864 --> 01:21:16,460
And by the time I got to the hospital,
you were awake.

1077
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,863
But you didn't know me.

1078
01:21:24,304 --> 01:21:26,374
So I left.

1079
01:21:27,544 --> 01:21:30,183
Every time we're together...

1080
01:21:30,704 --> 01:21:33,013
...they come after you through me.

1081
01:21:46,184 --> 01:21:50,143
You're built to save people
more than the rest of us.

1082
01:21:50,344 --> 01:21:53,097
That's who you are. You're a hero.

1083
01:21:54,664 --> 01:21:57,258
The insurance policy of the gods.

1084
01:21:57,784 --> 01:22:00,821
Keep one alive. You.

1085
01:22:01,504 --> 01:22:04,143
To protect this world.

1086
01:22:19,624 --> 01:22:20,579
Mary!

1087
01:22:23,304 --> 01:22:24,259
Mom!

1088
01:22:24,464 --> 01:22:25,738
-Mary!
-Stay down!

1089
01:22:26,184 --> 01:22:28,254
Okay.

1090
01:22:38,265 --> 01:22:39,459
Mary?

1091
01:22:52,145 --> 01:22:53,783
Stop.

1092
01:22:56,225 --> 01:22:58,341
Oh, no! No! Please!

1093
01:23:07,865 --> 01:23:09,344
Stay down.

1094
01:23:20,665 --> 01:23:22,337
Hey! Mary!

1095
01:23:22,545 --> 01:23:23,978
Let's go, get her up!

1096
01:23:24,985 --> 01:23:27,499
Come on, Chuck. Let's go, let's go.

1097
01:23:33,905 --> 01:23:36,135
-Morphine.
-Here. Help in here!

1098
01:23:37,465 --> 01:23:38,978
Hold her down. Hold her down.

1099
01:23:42,865 --> 01:23:43,820
Hold her down.

1100
01:23:50,585 --> 01:23:52,257
Hold her down.

1101
01:24:00,265 --> 01:24:02,335
-You want the monitor now?
-Stay calm.

1102
01:24:18,586 --> 01:24:20,861
-Hold her, hold her, hold her.
-Need EKG leads.

1103
01:24:53,866 --> 01:24:56,778
Upon us all, Hancock.

1104
01:24:57,546 --> 01:24:58,865
You're no different.

1105
01:25:03,346 --> 01:25:06,543
Time to shut her down, Hancock.

1106
01:25:06,746 --> 01:25:08,862
It's been a nice run.

1107
01:25:36,146 --> 01:25:39,900
Oh, we are all
sincerely gonna miss you.

1108
01:25:41,706 --> 01:25:43,503
But it is time for you to move on.

1109
01:25:47,226 --> 01:25:50,138
And maybe to a happier place.

1110
01:25:52,106 --> 01:25:54,461
You can thank me if you want to...

1111
01:25:55,626 --> 01:25:57,139
...superhero.

1112
01:26:07,147 --> 01:26:08,660
You didn't!

1113
01:26:14,747 --> 01:26:15,816
Aaron!

1114
01:29:18,788 --> 01:29:23,145
-What about Attila the Hun?
-Completely cross-eyed.

1115
01:29:23,348 --> 01:29:24,303
-Cross-eyed?
-Yep.

1116
01:29:24,548 --> 01:29:27,187
All right,
what about Queen Elizabeth?

1117
01:29:27,388 --> 01:29:30,858
-Needy.
-J.F.K.? What about him?

1118
01:29:31,468 --> 01:29:33,743
Oh, yeah.

1119
01:29:34,748 --> 01:29:37,023
"Oh, yeah"? Anything more?

1120
01:29:37,228 --> 01:29:39,822
Not like that. I was in Cuba
for the whole missile thing.

1121
01:29:40,029 --> 01:29:41,018
Yeah, hang on.

1122
01:29:43,029 --> 01:29:45,099
-Hello?
-Ray.

1123
01:29:45,309 --> 01:29:47,186
Hey, I've been trying to call you.

1124
01:29:47,389 --> 01:29:49,983
Yeah, I was out of cell range.

1125
01:29:50,829 --> 01:29:54,344
-Are you outside?
-Yeah.

1126
01:29:54,549 --> 01:29:57,825
-Look up.
-All right, I'm looking up.

1127
01:29:58,429 --> 01:30:00,306
I'm looking up.

1128
01:30:05,469 --> 01:30:08,188
-Baby?
-What?

1129
01:30:15,349 --> 01:30:17,385
You're gonna change the world.

1130
01:30:17,589 --> 01:30:20,786
-Good job, Ray.
-Oh, my God, Ray.

1131
01:30:21,949 --> 01:30:24,383
Hey. Look up.

1132
01:30:25,109 --> 01:30:26,462
Hancock.

1133
01:30:30,869 --> 01:30:32,541
I'm proud of you.

1134
01:30:32,749 --> 01:30:34,467
Thanks.

1135
01:30:36,549 --> 01:30:38,858
Will I get in trouble for that?

1136
01:31:52,030 --> 01:31:54,180
-Freeze!
-Don't move!

1137
01:31:54,390 --> 01:31:56,426
-Oh, my God! Sam! No!
-Drop your weapon, sir!

1138
01:31:56,630 --> 01:31:57,904
Get back! Get back! Get back!

1139
01:31:58,150 --> 01:32:00,459
-Drop it!
-Get back or I'll shoot! Get back!

1140
01:32:00,670 --> 01:32:02,228
Get back! I'm not playing.

1141
01:32:02,670 --> 01:32:05,309
Get back. Get back!

1142
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:07,900
Damn, Handjob.
Where you come from?

1143
01:32:08,110 --> 01:32:10,146
All right, relax.
Just tell me what you need.

1144
01:32:10,350 --> 01:32:12,545
Tell them cops to take
their guns off of me.

1145
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:14,866
-All right.
-Tell them to take the guns off me.

1146
01:32:15,070 --> 01:32:16,788
Just take them off.
Lower your weapons.

1147
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:21,108
You're gonna get us out of here
with that tight-ass Wolverine outfit on.

1148
01:32:21,550 --> 01:32:23,825
Now let's make it happen, asshole.

1149
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,114
