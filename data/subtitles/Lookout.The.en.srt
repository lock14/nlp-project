1
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,917
Yeah?

2
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:40,618
Yeah, I got it.

3
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:30,501
Take it easy, Lu.
You gotta have a little faith.

4
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,978
Relax.
Have something to eat.

5
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,777
<i>There's some more stuff
in the fridge, if you like.</i>

6
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,751
- You want some coffee?
- No, I just want this to be over with.

7
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,532
<i>I'm gonna lie down.</i>

8
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,727
<i>- Lu, you gonna be okay?
- Yeah.</i>

9
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:06,005
<i>- Hi, baby.
- Hi.</i>

10
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,673
Thanks.
Come here, come here.

11
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,342
Come over here.

12
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,114
- You got to take it easy.
- I shouldn't have done this, Michael.

13
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,679
- This is insane.
- Come on, come on.

14
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,817
Come on, look what it's done.
I mean, look where we are.

15
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,953
Well, won't last forever.

16
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,626
Yes, it will. This is
gonna last forever.

17
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:33,798
- You don't know these people.
- Let's just get through the trial.

18
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:37,741
Then we'll get the hell out of
the country, just you and me.

19
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:44,881
- I love you.
- I love you too, kid.

20
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:01,056
<i>I had such a great time
at the party last night.</i>

21
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,501
<i>They always get
the best caterers.</i>

22
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,164
I don't know where they find them.
That food was great.

23
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,800
<i>What do we have here?</i>

24
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,417
<i>- McNamara, you there?
- Yeah, we're here.</i>

25
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,716
<i>We have a septic truck
right in front of the house.</i>

26
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,780
3-5-2-M-S-R.

27
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:28,520
Running the plate.

28
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:31,188
<i>"You dump it... We pump it."</i>

29
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,256
- Sounds like a government job.
- Yeah.

30
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,108
<i>Okay, the license plate checks out.</i>

31
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,205
<i>We have
a scheduled pump for today.</i>

32
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:52,479
Lucky us,
or should I say, lucky you?

33
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:55,612
You may unfasten your safety belts
and rhumba around the cabin.

34
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:05,460
<i>We have a pizza delivery this time.</i>

35
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:09,194
<i>Running the plate now.</i>

36
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:21,745
- What the hell, you guys didn't order pizza, did you?
- No, it's 7:00 in the morning.

37
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,078
<i>- Oh, shi...
We have a Code Red!</i>

38
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,970
Ready? Now!

39
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,598
- Freeze! Move!
- Turn around!

40
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:52,474
<i>I didn't do nothin'! I swear!</i>

41
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,036
I swear
I didn't do nothin'!

42
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,912
<i>- Hey!
- Relax!</i>

43
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,277
- Is it wired?
- I don't know!

44
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,857
Hey, this truck's
not pumpin' out, it's pumpin' in!

45
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,693
- Lu, get outta the house!
- Lu, get out!

46
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,673
Hey, go on and get
that truck outta there!

47
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,978
<i>Get that truck
outta here!</i>

48
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,679
Lu, get out!
Lu! Lu!

49
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,621
- Out the back!
- This way! This way!

50
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,797
Okay, get it outta here!
Get it out!

51
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,318
This way! Go!

52
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,361
Run, Lu, run!

53
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,296
Lu, help!
Aaah!

54
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:30,172
<i>Lu! Lu!</i>

55
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,604
Oh, my God!
Michael!

56
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,197
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

57
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:28,700
This is...
unbelievable!

58
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:32,932
The truck was filled with gasoline.
The guy must have had a remote.

59
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,940
Well, he detonated
his truck.

60
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,806
<i>Once they found out
where the safe house was,</i>

61
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:42,541
<i>it would have been easy
to find schedules.</i>

62
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,550
He probably intercepted the truck
sometime before the last stop.

63
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,609
<i>- We've uncovered another body.
- Where is it?</i>

64
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:51,555
Over there.
That makes number three.

65
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,294
- Is this Delano or not?
- No, I don't think so.

66
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,528
This weapon's
police issue.

67
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:12,638
Our entire case against Costanzo
is based on Delano's testimony.

68
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,545
So I would really like to know
if she is alive or dead...

69
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,413
<i>before I call her
to the witness stand!</i>

70
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:22,887
I can't take this goombah into court
with a bunch of circumstantial crap!

71
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,355
He'll walk, just like he
walked the last two times.

72
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:29,019
Hello! This was your responsibility,
sir, and you blew it!

73
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:32,087
- Don't you dare pin this on me!
- Don't talk back to me!

74
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:35,656
Hey, listen!
This whole operation was compromised!

75
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,863
<i>- Back off!
- What you people don't seem to be able to understand...</i>

76
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,270
is that without
this witness, I have no case!

77
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,776
<i>Now, can anyone tell me
if she is dead?</i>

78
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:49,247
Sir, I don't
think she's one of the bodies.

79
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:54,412
- You think she survived this?
- I've looked at all the bodies we found.

80
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,513
None of them match
Delano's description.

81
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,924
Are you telling me
that she's alive?

82
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:07,659
Well, she's definitely not
one of the bodies we have.

83
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,230
Then where the hell is she?

84
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,875
- Hey.
- Loser.

85
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:03,814
- I think it's him.
- Where?

86
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,880
Long hair
over by the pickup.

87
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,688
Hey, what do ya got?

88
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:15,496
- You sure? - Son-of-a-bitch
killed my friends. Cut me bad.

89
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,196
- Think I'd forget?
- We got a positive I.D.

90
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,171
Told you not to bother me
unless it was important.

91
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,267
- Hope you're wearin' sun block.
- I'm a construction worker. I need rays.

92
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:29,212
<i>He's coming in your direction.
Fatigues, glasses, long hair.</i>

93
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:33,047
- Whoo! What have we got here?
- Hey, you jerk!

94
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,782
I think we should arrest him
for what he's wearing.

95
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,984
Yeah, he looks like he's on page 26
of Madonna's sex book.

96
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:44,894
<i>I got him.</i>

97
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,898
Think it's safe to assume
he's armed and dangerous?

98
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,526
- Wanna yell, "Freeze"?
- I yelled "Freeze" last time.

99
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,730
<i>- Go ahead, it makes you feel better.
- No, no, no.</i>

100
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,035
Hey, stay here.
No, no, you get hurt, it's my ass.

101
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,658
<i>Wait, wait! Hold it!</i>

102
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,265
<i>Whoops.</i>

103
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,935
Yes! Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

104
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:36,345
What are you lookin' at?
Go after 'im!

105
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:40,647
<i>No, I've seen this one before.
You go there. I'll take the back.</i>

106
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:55,624
- He's goin' upstairs!
- Got it!

107
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,704
<i>- Aah!
- Freeze! Oh!</i>

108
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:06,336
Uh, just a hunch, but I don't think
this guy's gonna go in peacefully.

109
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,808
Freeze!

110
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:13,249
He's not freezing!

111
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:17,779
- Try, "Stop or I'll shoot!"
- Stop or I'll shoot!

112
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,451
Nope!
Anything else?

113
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,858
Did you say,
"Simon says"?

114
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,790
Watch a pro.

115
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,494
- Police! You're under arrest!
- Whoa!

116
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,578
Aaah!

117
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,084
Chris!

118
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,052
Aaah!

119
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:55,484
Yuck!

120
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,496
So that's how
a pro does it, huh?

121
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,674
Die.

122
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:17,275
Hey, wait! Wait! Whoa, whoa!
Seattle P.D., stop that truck!

123
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,020
Hey! Seattle P.D.!
Stop!

124
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,860
Stop the truck!

125
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,361
- Stop the truck.
- What?

126
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,428
My partner's
in the back.

127
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,620
Da-daaaa!

128
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,991
<i>I'm hit!</i>

129
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,836
<i>Let's get outta here!</i>

130
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,637
Son-of-a-bitch
killed my friend.

131
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,512
Drop it!

132
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,484
Mm-hmm.

133
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:34,851
Shi...
Oh, no.

134
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,791
<i>Yeah, what do you want?</i>

135
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:45,928
- Gina Garrett for the captain.
- Okay.

136
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,270
Gina Garrett for you.

137
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,708
Hey, you two!

138
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,713
Stinky, Reimers!
Captain's havin' a hemorrhoid.

139
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,944
Wants your butts
in his office A.S.A.P.

140
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,714
- I'm sorry, Gina Garrett, was it?
- Gina Garrett, yes.

141
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,153
<i>In!</i>

142
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:08,387
<i>All right,
gimme a minute. I'll get back to ya.</i>

143
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,396
Oh, let me guess.

144
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,991
Sanitation and construction.
Two of my favorites... Uh-uh-uh-uh!

145
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,559
Don't you dare sit in
those chairs. Either of ya.

146
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:21,162
Detective Lecce, is this the weapon
involved in the assault?

147
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,174
- Yes, sir, Captain, sir.
- Do we know whose weapon it is?

148
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:27,440
- Yes, Captain, sir, it's mine.
- Okay, let's get some facts straight.

149
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:31,142
Winston and I don't want Internal
Affairs pointing a finger at us,

150
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,912
<i>saying that we didn't
do ourjob right.</i>

151
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:37,319
The gun fell out of my hand because I
happened to be falling out of a window.

152
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,357
Witness picked it up,
shot the suspect. Sue me.

153
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:43,828
Since this is now classified
as an officer-involved shooting,

154
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,354
<i>- you two won't mind a quick visit with the D.A.'s office.
- What?</i>

155
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,958
- The guy was resisting arrest!
- It took the two of us to hold him down!

156
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,128
<i>- He can't file charges against me!
- Really?</i>

157
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:56,300
<i>- The gun was falling out of my hand!
- Hey! Hey!</i>

158
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,367
- Who said anything about filing charges?
- You said the D.A.'s office!

159
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:04,007
I didn't say anything. You two are
temporarily reassigned to the D.A.'s office.

160
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,018
<i>- They'd like to stop by and tell you why.
- Do we get a choice?</i>

161
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:12,023
Choice?
A handcuffed suspect?

162
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,721
- Good afternoon.
- Phillip. Gentlemen.

163
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:20,731
<i>Gentlemen, this is Assistant
District Attorney Gina Garrett.</i>

164
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,233
<i>- This is Det. Chris Lecce and Det. Bill Reimers.
- Hello.</i>

165
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:27,830
- Oh, I'm really sorry about that.
- Don't use my scarf!

166
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:31,205
- I got some spaghetti all over...
- Everything's fine.

167
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,870
Gentlemen, this assignment's
confidential. Don't discuss it.

168
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,746
<i>Two days ago the Las Vegas D.A.
and the U.S. Department ofJustice...</i>

169
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,876
asked us to help find a witness
who was gonna testify...

170
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,217
against the head
of a Chicago crime family.

171
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,155
Luella Delano was the witness.

172
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:50,355
<i>Justice had her under protective custody
until someone blew up the safe house,</i>

173
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,227
<i>- killing several agents.
- How many are several?</i>

174
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,267
<i>Three.
Somehow she got away.</i>

175
00:18:56,335 --> 00:19:01,034
She's made no attempt to contact the Department
ofJustice or the Las Vegas D.A. since then.

176
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:03,904
- What, no postcard?
- No.

177
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,910
Trial begins next week.
The Feds are all worked up.

178
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,674
Apparently, without Delano
the government has no case.

179
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:12,274
So all leads are being followed,
including one which leads here.

180
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:17,721
<i>Phone call Delano made to a number here in
Seattle belonging to a Brian and Pam O'Hara.</i>

181
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,383
- She may be lookin' to lay low with them.
- Anybody check the O'Haras?

182
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,053
They left for their vacation home
on Bainbridge Island two days ago...

183
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,460
which makes putting them
under surveillance a little tricky.

184
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,227
- Stakeout.
- We heard you're good at it.

185
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,600
We cannot rotate surveillance teams.
You'll be on it round the clock.

186
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:37,233
I have managed to secure the house next to
the O'Haras. It belongs toJudge Hoberman.

187
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,608
- Maximum Dave?
- I've had to promise on my career...

188
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,877
that nothing would happen to his house, so
gentlemen, nothing had better happen to his house.

189
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,043
- So no wipin' your boogers on the sofa.
- Don't say boogers!

190
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,053
- It's a habit ya have to break.
- What's the matter...

191
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:53,615
Your cover is you're renting the
judge's house for a month of vacation.

192
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,058
<i>As what, friends or lovers?</i>

193
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:59,325
We think you'll be able
to pass for father and son.

194
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:03,892
What, are you kidding me?

195
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,130
- Uh-uh.
- Dad?

196
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,639
- No way! Just stop it right now.
- Papa!

197
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,608
- And I'll be going with you?
- Really? As my granddaughter?

198
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,646
- No, your wife.
- My wife?

199
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,614
- Your second wife actually.
- Look, boss, this is not...

200
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,674
Detective!
I'm the boss.

201
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:23,414
<i>- You're the...
- Yes, Detective, I am the boss.</i>

202
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:27,151
Okay, this is a joke, right?

203
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,430
Okeydoke.
I'll see ya later.

204
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:45,840
- Uh, Daddy?
- Don't start with that crap.

205
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,972
- I'm just practicing.
- Oh, practice your prayers, pal.

206
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,778
Come on, come on.
Just try calling me "son"just once.

207
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,978
- You're really getting off on this one. The dad thing.
- Hello, son.

208
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:58,352
The thing with the dad and the son
thing. This is a big chuckle, right?

209
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:02,120
- We have to be able to talk.
- Eat me. How's that?

210
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,958
Does Maria let you
talk to her like that?

211
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:10,024
I'm my own man. When you're all grown
up, you'll understand what that means.

212
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,464
- Hey, Ray. What are you doin'?
- Chris.

213
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:20,204
Helpin' my sister out.
Sorry, nothin' personal.

214
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,147
"Nothing personal"?

215
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,653
Maria!

216
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,713
<i>- Get out!
- What the hell is going on here?</i>

217
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,521
<i>- I said, "Get out."
- I know what you said.</i>

218
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:38,427
Then do it
and take your stuff!

219
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,432
<i>Maria, talk to me.</i>

220
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,661
Maria.

221
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,500
- Are you throwing me out?
- Yes!

222
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:50,439
- What the hell is wrong?
- Nothing your leaving won't cure.

223
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:55,003
<i>Did I miss a couple of pages? Exactly
what is it I'm supposed to have done?</i>

224
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,777
- You came home.
- I always come home. It's what I do before I go back to work.

225
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,513
Well, I am saving you
a trip.

226
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:04,714
Could we go back
a couple of steps?

227
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,281
<i>Not that many either.
Just like last night.</i>

228
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,921
<i>Remember? I came home, we had dinner,
we made love, we went to sleep.</i>

229
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,831
In the morning, I got up and went
to work. Now did I miss something?

230
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:19,393
<i>Ooh!</i>

231
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:23,601
I'm leaving.
When I come back, I want you gone.

232
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,609
No, not until
you tell me why.

233
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,475
Because I'm tired of wanting
something I'm not gonna get.

234
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,947
- You're happy. I'm not.
- Oh, Maria, we have been over this.

235
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,951
Don't bother, I don't want
to hear the reasons anymore.

236
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:38,080
Marriage doesn't work in my family. My
parents, my sisters, my brothers, aunts.

237
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:41,387
Everybody got divorc... If we got
married, that would be the end of this.

238
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,122
What do you think
this is?

239
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,426
- Maria. Maria, we love each other.
- Move!

240
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:50,525
Why do you want to ruin the whole
thing for a goddamn piece of paper?

241
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:53,127
Get out of my way,
you asshole!

242
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,197
I am not leaving.
Do you hear me? I am not leaving!

243
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,504
I'm willing to work this out.
I'm not leaving.

244
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:02,069
Okay, Chris.
You're right. You stay.

245
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:26,335
- What are you doing?
- Calling the police.

246
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,602
- Ha-ha-ha! Very funny.
- McGuire, Maria.

247
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,904
M-c-G-u-i-r-e.

248
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,946
Yes, I'd like to report
a domestic disturbance.

249
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:39,882
<i>That's right, isn't it? I'd hate to be
wrong after living with a cop for six years.</i>

250
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:44,445
<i>Yes, a domestic disturbance.
I'm being held against my will.</i>

251
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:51,985
<i>All right. All right!
I'll marry you!</i>

252
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,798
Life is too short.

253
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:16,616
I don't have much time,
so just listen.

254
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:20,988
- They don't think Delano's dead.
- Are you sure?

255
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:24,153
<i>- Yes, I'm sure.
- Well, then, where the hell is she?</i>

256
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:29,326
No one knows.
She hasn't contacted anybody.

257
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:33,497
Chances are, if they find her, it
won't be until after the trial anyway.

258
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:37,565
<i>- There's no guarantee.
- You're the guarantee, Hassrick.</i>

259
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,576
Do you understand me?

260
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,807
<i>It is not my fault.
It's your man.</i>

261
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:47,113
You just find her
and you call me. Got it?

262
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:50,586
Fine. I will.
If I find out.

263
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:07,135
Hey, guys. Sit tight. I'll be
with you in a second.

264
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,332
So, did she tell you why
or was it just...

265
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:11,534
- You know.
- Marriage.

266
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,841
- Mmm.
- Mmm, commitment thing.

267
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:17,040
- So what are you afraid of?
- Advice.

268
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:24,548
<i>Okay, guys, here it goes.
Unleaded fuel only.</i>

269
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:28,821
Check the oil when you fill it up
and don't try and use the car phone.

270
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:31,795
Because...
We disconnected it.

271
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:35,890
I know you guys might feel a little
tempted to have some fun... Hey!

272
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:38,731
Chill! Keep your yang
in your pants.

273
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,897
This vehicle goes on sale
at the auction at the end of next week.

274
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:46,967
The guys upstairs expressly asked
me to ask you two not to mess it up.

275
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,707
You got that?
Okay.

276
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:54,480
- All right, guys, who gets
the keys? - Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

277
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:59,320
I'm the dad! This is a family car.
You'll have to beg.

278
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:19,009
- Hey!
- Whoo-ha!

279
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,748
Hey!

280
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:26,511
<i>Ave...</i>

281
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,518
So, what do you think?
Left or right?

282
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:39,793
<i>Well, maybe this
won't be so bad.</i>

283
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,855
We've been in worse situations
than this before, right?

284
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,867
Remember all that stuff
with Drooling Harry?

285
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,403
I told you never to mention
Drooling Harry again.

286
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:51,636
<i>This is it.
What clown painted this place?</i>

287
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:59,643
Archie, shut up!
I could use some help up here, please.

288
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,551
Help your mother.

289
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,824
Good boy, yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

290
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:13,227
<i>Whoa! Whoa, whoa!
Are you nuts? Four bags?</i>

291
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,892
- Oh, please, don't give me that man thing.
- No, no, no.

292
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:19,164
- This is not a man thing. This is a woman thing.
- Well, this is what I'm taking.

293
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:22,502
Fine, take the bags!
We're stayin' here.

294
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:26,101
Isn't this great? Our first fight.
Feel like a family already.

295
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:29,840
Listen, Detective,
we're supposed to be well-to-do.

296
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:33,077
I cannot do well-to-do
with one change of clothes.

297
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,018
So this is what I'm taking.
Open the trunk.

298
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:42,288
<i>We could leave the bugging
equipment and recorder.</i>

299
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,524
<i>I suppose. Of course, we could
write down what they say.</i>

300
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:49,192
Should have taken that shorthand
course. What about the cameras?

301
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,201
- Leave 'em. You can draw pretty well.
- Yeah.

302
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,931
Just need to pick up some paper and
some crayons, the big thick ones.

303
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:58,772
- Don't leave the pictures on the refrigerator...
- All right. All right.

304
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:04,338
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

305
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:07,715
You cannot be paper
every time.

306
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:10,949
- There are no rules in paper, rock, scissors.
- Yes, there are.

307
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,115
- No, there are not.
- Yes, there are.

308
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:17,959
- Yes, there are.
- Oh, God, don't be so childish.

309
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:25,462
Good boy, sit!

310
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,700
- I hope you're taking him for a walk.
- He's coming with us.

311
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,741
- Not a chance.
- No way.

312
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,709
<i>- What's the problem?
- We're on a job.</i>

313
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:35,371
What are you afraid
he's gonna tell the neighbors?

314
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:38,814
- Put him in a kennel.
I've never put him in a kennel.

315
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,215
And I'm not about to start now.
He is very well trained.

316
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,413
He'll simply lie by the fire.
I'll take him for walks.

317
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:47,322
It doesn't get much more complicated than
that. Really. We're a family, gentlemen.

318
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,485
<i>- Families have dogs.
- Not this family.</i>

319
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,325
If he doesn't go,
I don't go.

320
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:04,104
Archie! Up!

321
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:12,673
Don't make any sudden movements. He's
trained. He's not that well trained.

322
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,642
<i>So what do you think,
I should marry her?</i>

323
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,044
<i>It's only a stakeout, Chris.
It'll be over in a couple of days.</i>

324
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,548
<i>Maria!
I'm talking about Maria.</i>

325
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,585
<i>If you're asking me, I think you
should have married her six years ago.</i>

326
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:51,053
- Hmm, I was too young.
- How about now?

327
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,319
- I'm, I'm too old!
- Or maybe you're too late.

328
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:59,329
Did you ever think the reason she dumped you
was maybe because she's seein' another guy?

329
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:02,560
- If she was seein' somebody else, I'd know.
- Maybe!

330
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,159
No maybe.
I would know, all right?

331
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:08,433
If she was seein'
somebody else, I'd know.

332
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:12,340
Yeah, you're right. Beautiful girl
like her dumps you for a younger guy.

333
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,004
That could never happen.

334
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:18,276
Look at me, I've been married for
eight years. I have two wonderful kids.

335
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:22,183
I'm happy, still in love and not a
grey hair on my head. Now look at you.

336
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:24,187
- Have I done something to offend you?
- Do you love her?

337
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:27,452
- Yes! I love her.
- Then marry her! Commit to her.

338
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:31,461
You're not gonna find
a better woman than Maria.

339
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,463
Looks like
our time is up.

340
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:37,467
- How much do I owe you?
- Oh, this stuff don't come cheap.

341
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:40,333
- Two, three bucks?
- Three. Thank you.

342
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:44,671
<i>Excuse me.
I don't mean to interrupt.</i>

343
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:47,370
Listen, I know that you feel
this assignment is beneath you.

344
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:51,279
Perhaps because I'm a woman, maybe because
I'm not a cop. It doesn't really matter.

345
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,874
The fact is, I'm really not
as bad as you think I am.

346
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,149
I'm hoping you're not
as bad as I think you are.

347
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:00,214
- He is.
- Look, you just do what you do and we'll do what we do.

348
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,657
- Okay? It really doesn't get anymore complicated than that.
- Fine.

349
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:07,061
That's fine. I've prepared our backgrounds in
case we come into contact with our neighbors.

350
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:10,726
We need to have a cohesive story.
I've tried to keep it simple.

351
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:14,499
Chris,
what's this word?

352
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:16,540
- "The."
- Oh, yeah.

353
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:20,203
There is one more thing. I think
that Bill should shave his mustache.

354
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,879
Excuse me?

355
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:27,247
Your mustache. It would make you look a lot
younger and you are supposed to be Chris' son.

356
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:30,219
- Forget it!
- I really think it would be more convincing.

357
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:33,348
I don't think you understand the
relationship a man has with his facial hair.

358
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:36,154
Oh, please! I am not asking you
to cut off your penis.

359
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,593
- Maybe you'd like to try!
- Don't be ridiculous.

360
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:42,895
I have had this mustache for 13
years! How long have you had yours?

361
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:50,970
Man's relationship
with his facial hair, eh?

362
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:20,466
- How's it goin'?
- I'm not talking to you. You took her side.

363
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:23,803
This is the second marriage
for you and the first for me, Chris.

364
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,639
- What happened to my first wife?
- Your first wife is dead.

365
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:30,238
- Hmm, great.
- You think this is stupid, don't you?

366
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:32,977
You have any idea what's
really goin' on here?

367
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:37,147
You know what a stakeout is all
about? You sit, you listen, you watch.

368
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:40,384
That's it.
You don't participate.

369
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:44,155
You don't go over and borrow a cup of
sugar and you don't bake them cookies.

370
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,924
- That about covers it.
- You know, Bill, you look a lot younger.

371
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,398
I look 12 years old!

372
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,681
<i>- It's so beautiful.
- That one's ours.</i>

373
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:15,023
Not bad, Pop.

374
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:25,595
Archie, stay.

375
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,434
<i>Thank you, Bill.</i>

376
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:44,450
- You are unbelievable.
- I'm an innocent guy.

377
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:48,358
You want me
to carry you across the threshold?

378
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:51,554
No, we've been married
for five years. The thrill is gone.

379
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:01,396
Look at that view.

380
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:05,636
Oh, it's gorgeous.

381
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,907
Oh, look at these antiques.
My God, it must be worth a fortune!

382
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,971
Oh, I want to be a judge!

383
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:18,515
<i>Hey, it's Stickley!
Stickley's my favorite.</i>

384
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:22,320
Stickley's our favorite!

385
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:30,666
<i>This is fine-quality furniture, gentlemen.
Could you please be careful with your fingers?</i>

386
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,930
<i>- Pretty good.
- Better here.</i>

387
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:02,522
<i>See everybody
comin'and goin'.</i>

388
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:12,533
Looks good to me.

389
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,422
Archie?
Oh, no. Archie, boy!

390
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,459
Archie!

391
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:31,927
Oh, Lord.
Oh, no, Archie! Archie!

392
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,123
<i>No, boy! Archie!</i>

393
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:37,895
<i>- Mommy said, "No!"Archie!
- Oh, stop, it's gone.</i>

394
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,938
- Will you forget about it?
- I miss it! Okay?

395
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:47,641
He's headin' next door!
Archie!

396
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,907
<i>Archie! No, Archie!</i>

397
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:54,241
<i>No! Archie!</i>

398
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,583
<i>No!
Come back here, Archie!</i>

399
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:03,252
Archie!
No, Archie!

400
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,194
Wait for Mommy!
Archie!

401
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:10,098
Shoot the dog!

402
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:32,621
<i>No! Bad dog, Archie!
No! Mommy said, "No!"</i>

403
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,127
- Hi, is everything all right?
- Hi!

404
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,722
Oh, yes! Everything's fine.
My dog's not usually like this.

405
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:44,165
It's our dog, actually.
He's quite friendly.

406
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:47,534
I think, yeah, your cat's fine.
Just a little bit scared.

407
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:51,063
It's no problem. It's not even our cat. It
belongs to the Outlingers's down the road.

408
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,235
<i>- Every dog in the neighborhood chases it.
- Every dog.</i>

409
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:57,873
<i>- I'm sorry about the garden.
- Don't worry about it.</i>

410
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:00,144
<i>- It's not gonna happen again.
- It's all right.</i>

411
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,881
- Are you staying around here?
- Yes, we've rented the house next door.

412
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:06,515
- Great!
- Oh, you know Judge Hoberman?

413
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:11,392
- Maximum Dave.
- Not, not well. We met him couple of times.

414
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:14,329
- Well, I'm Pam O'Hara. This is my husband, Brian.
- Hi!

415
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:18,095
Great, I'm Gina.
This is my husband...

416
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:22,868
Chris! Chris.
It's an unusual name.

417
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:27,274
Hi, I'm Chris' son, Bill.
I'm his son from his first marriage.

418
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:31,247
- My, uh, mom's dead.
- Oh.

419
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:34,580
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

420
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:37,018
I guess we'll be seeing
a lot more of you then.

421
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,716
Yes! That would be lovely.
We'd like that, wouldn't we?

422
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,281
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
We'll have drinks...

423
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,590
and dinner maybe.

424
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,960
Maybe we'll even have a party.
You know, what the hell?

425
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,692
- Sure.
- That'll be great.

426
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,599
- Really like that, wouldn't you, honey?
- Yes, that would be lovely.

427
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:54,638
We're gonna leave
you guys alone here.

428
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:57,731
- Nice to meet you and we're
gonna go home. - Good-bye.

429
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:59,537
- So long.
- See ya. Bye-bye.

430
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,579
<i>- Come on, Archie.
- That's a nice mustache.</i>

431
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:06,811
<i>- You had that long?
- A long time. Most of my life, really.</i>

432
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:10,217
<i>- You had that for a while.
- Billy, please. Honey.</i>

433
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:14,247
Okay, so, uh, we've been
here, what, five minutes?

434
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:17,726
I usually wait two or three days before I
introduce myself to the people I'm staking out.

435
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,320
I'm sorry, okay?
It will not happen again.

436
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:23,629
I will keep him in the house and I'm
sorry about blanking on your name.

437
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:28,229
Blanking on my name. Hello, my name
is Gina. This is my husband, duh!

438
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,240
- That's really not nice. Do you know that?
- Mom, Dad!

439
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,004
<i>- Please don't fight in front of me. It's very upsetting.
- What, you think this is funny?</i>

440
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,511
It's not my dog.
This assignment gets blown,

441
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:38,013
it's not my butt,
it's Archie's butt.

442
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:40,846
Good point.

443
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:44,513
Hello, this is Chris.
Is Mari...

444
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:50,322
<i>Hola, es Chris.
Es Maria en casa?</i>

445
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:54,626
<i>Well, would you tell...
Diga Maria se llama?</i>

446
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:57,327
<i>Si. No, no, no.
Momento.</i>

447
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:01,497
<i>Um, dos, uh, cero,
uh, seis,</i>

448
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:03,597
<i>uh, siete, uh...</i>

449
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,642
<i>Uno, dos, tres, quatro,
cinqo, seis, siete...</i>

450
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,678
<i>- Ocho.
- Ocho.</i>

451
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:10,213
<i>- Dos, cero, seis, siete, ocho, ocho.
- Okay, dos, cero, seis...</i>

452
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:14,479
<i>- Shut up!
- Dos, cero, seis, siete, ocho, ocho.</i>

453
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:17,988
<i>Dos, cero, seis,
siete, ocho, ocho.</i>

454
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:20,546
<i>- Gracious.
-</i>

455
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:25,493
<i>Senor. Pendejo.
Cuidado.</i>

456
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:29,294
- So what'd she say?
- She wasn't home.

457
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,336
- Yeah? Try work?
- She wasn't there either.

458
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:35,395
- Well, she's probably just out.
- Yeah? Where?

459
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:38,806
- Oh, shopping or something. How do I know?
- She's with another guy.

460
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,344
<i>- How do you know that?
- You told me.</i>

461
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:44,347
- Hello, I was kidding.
- I'm gonna find out.

462
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:48,374
Wait for Mommy, honey.
Good boy.

463
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:51,012
<i>- You're acting like a madman.
- I'll be back.</i>

464
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:53,215
- Look, we are on a job.
- I'm just gonna ask her if she's seeing somebody.

465
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:56,157
- I am telling you as a friend, don't do this.
- I'm gonna tell you as a friend,

466
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,161
<i>don't do this.</i>

467
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:02,191
No-no! No!

468
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:05,030
<i>Wait, I need that car!
Wait a second!</i>

469
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:09,163
<i>Wait, wait! Wait! Wait!</i>

470
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:22,008
<i>Tell me about it later?</i>

471
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:26,546
Hmm.

472
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:30,526
Sir, excuse me.

473
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,424
Tony, where ya goin'?

474
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:40,868
They, uh, couldn't
identify her body.

475
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:45,398
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying, without confirmation we're nervous.

476
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:48,104
- You want me to get confirmation?
- What we want is...

477
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:51,546
reassurance that the job
you were paid for... was done.

478
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,083
- You know she's alive?
- We don't know she isn't.

479
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:56,881
- You know the situation that puts us in.
- I'm gonna say it again.

480
00:40:56,954 --> 00:41:01,050
- What are you saying? Do you want the money back?
- Tony, Tony.

481
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:06,495
You misunderstand me.
Money is not the issue here. Trust is.

482
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:10,227
That's why we came to you with this
very important piece of business.

483
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:15,739
And Tony, we have every confidence you'll
do the job that was entrusted to you.

484
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:19,908
Okay?

485
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:27,350
- Oh, makin' dinner?
- Yes, I am. Love cooking.

486
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,909
- Mmm, looks good.
- Thank you very much.

487
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,848
- It's late. Maria should be home by now.
- Maybe.

488
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:37,587
- Why don't you try calling her again?
- It's too late.

489
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:41,256
She's probably married by now.
I have to get her a gift.

490
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:45,234
<i>Did you know she asked me
to be her maid of honor?</i>

491
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:52,006
<i>So... when are we gonna
invite them over for drinks?</i>

492
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:55,705
- Ah, Bill?
- Yes, Chris?

493
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:58,475
Did I just hear you suggest that we
invite the neighbors over for drinks,

494
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:01,518
the very people that
we're here to stake out?

495
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:05,544
- Why, no, Chris. I would never do such a thing.
- Good to know, Bill!

496
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:09,787
The reason that I thought is because
it's simply a more expedient way...

497
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,021
of finding out whether or not
they've heard anything about Delano.

498
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:14,564
And how do you expect us
to go about doing that? I know!

499
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:18,659
Maybe we could just ask them if they
have any friends in protective custody.

500
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:22,001
<i>It was not my idea. You happen to
be the one who invited them over.</i>

501
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:25,735
- I did not!
- You certainly did invite them!

502
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,640
- Not! Not!
- You went, Yes!

503
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,838
- Not! Not!
- Yes! Yes! Yes, you did!

504
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:32,644
<i>You said as clear as day, "Why
don't you come over for drinks?"</i>

505
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:36,049
<i>- Oh, now!
- "Maybe for dinner! Heck! Let's have a party!"</i>

506
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,748
- That's what you said! Yes. Is that what he said?
- No, no, no.

507
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:41,256
- Technically yes.
- "Technically"?

508
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:43,555
You should have defended me
on the mustache thing.

509
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:49,088
I didn't mean it, okay?
I was lying!

510
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:53,398
You know, I had no intention of inviting
them over here for drinks or anything else.

511
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,234
Let's just put it down to the fact
that I'm a bad neighbor, all right?

512
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:59,071
As soon as they understand that,
everyone will get along fine.

513
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:04,770
- That's good. What is that?
- Hummus.

514
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:07,408
- What-us?
- Hummus.

515
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:10,749
Some sliced vegetables,
a side of hummus. A hummus-side!

516
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:14,882
Oh, that's funny.

517
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:21,022
<i>Hello?</i>

518
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,066
I can't believe you've never
seen the show before.

519
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,260
All right, now,
which one is "Stimpy"?

520
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:29,102
Stimpy's the cat
and Ren is the Chihuahua.

521
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:32,472
- You idiot!
- And which one is "Stinky"?

522
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:35,706
Stinky is not a regular on the show.
Stinky just appears every now and again...

523
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,213
Oh, so the bodily functions
don't appear every day?

524
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:41,774
No, it's like a guest-starring bodily
function. Sometimes it's rotting teeth.

525
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:44,150
- Sometimes it's farts.
- Where have I been?

526
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:48,282
You know this is the end of Western
civilization as we know it, don't you?

527
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:51,385
- I got the tap in.
- Good-bye.

528
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:10,037
Hey, I'm not just
a piece of meat, you know.

529
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:44,177
<i>11.58 a.m.
Mrs. O'Hara goes peepee.</i>

530
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:49,949
Do you have to go peepee?
Hmm? I bet you do.

531
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:54,013
Well, you should have thought about
that before we left for the island.

532
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:59,122
No! Chris! Don't take the car.

533
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,061
You'll kill
your... self!

534
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:26,251
- Nice steady stream.
No penile obstructions.

535
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:36,457
<i>3.58 a.m.
Mr. O'Hara goes peepee.</i>

536
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:46,075
Two peepees in one night. You people
are gonna give me high blood pressure.

537
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:18,068
<i>What is it, Archie? What is it?</i>

538
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:29,251
<i>What is so important at...</i>

539
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:32,413
4:41 in the morning?

540
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:35,617
Come on, Brian, Pam,
talk to me.

541
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:38,252
<i>Is it Delano?</i>

542
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:45,761
No, Bill,
it's not Delano.

543
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:48,964
It's diarrhea.

544
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:54,978
- You know all about diarrhea,
don't you, Arch?

545
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:59,072
I bet you get it when someone gives
you a nice big piece of chocolate.

546
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:02,277
Come here. Come here.

547
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,982
Oooh!

548
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:27,106
Oooh!

549
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:30,908
<i>Get off Mommy's bed.</i>

550
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:33,074
- Hurry up, hurry up. Come on, let's go!
- What, what?

551
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,414
- Do you want to be part of this stakeout or not?
- Okay.

552
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:39,444
Come on. You have got to follow him!
He might be going to meet Delano.

553
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,959
Let's go! And I'm injured!
Come on, take the dog!

554
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,426
Get the dog!
Archie!

555
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:56,997
Get up
or move over.

556
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,143
They had a lot to talk about
at 4:00 in the morning.

557
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:04,339
<i>I think we should
put in a bug.</i>

558
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:12,383
Mr. O'Hara went for a jog.
I told her to follow him.

559
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:16,950
<i>You told her to follow him?</i>

560
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,791
Call 9-1-1.

561
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:27,332
Good, Archie.
Good boy.

562
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:46,579
<i>All right, doin'okay.
Slow down for Mommy, Archie.</i>

563
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:52,888
All right.

564
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:13,339
Oh. Oh, God. Oh.

565
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:15,408
Archie, no.
Mommy can't go, Archie.

566
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:19,114
Archie! Archie!

567
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:21,919
<i>Okay, good boy.
Let Mommy rest.</i>

568
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:30,062
No, Archie!

569
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,192
No, not the bunny,
Archie.

570
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:35,466
<i>No, no, Archie. Archie!
Leave the bunny!</i>

571
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:40,306
<i>No! No!
Aaah!</i>

572
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:01,964
Ah!

573
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:07,895
<i>Ah! A little
gardening action, huh?</i>

574
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:11,668
<i>Love that gardening action.
What have we got, peas and carrots?</i>

575
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:18,076
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah. Just...
There you go. Get those weeds.</i>

576
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:20,844
Get that... Turn around.
Turn around.

577
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:23,385
Yes, get that weed.
Yes!

578
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:28,322
<i>Yeah.
Brian's home.</i>

579
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:37,294
No, I'll do that for you.
Ah! Oh!

580
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:40,234
<i>Feel better, huh?</i>

581
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,147
Where's Gina?

582
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:06,262
- All right, slowly.
- Okay.

583
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,627
- You all right?
- Yes, thank you.

584
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:13,135
- I got you.
- Okay. Ow.

585
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:16,001
Come on, Archie.

586
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:19,406
- Okay, here we go. You all right?
- Oh, yes, thank you, Frank.

587
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:23,276
- No problem.
- This ended up being such a joy.

588
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:27,112
- What happened?
- Oh, I sprained my ankle. I'm fine.

589
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:30,984
Hi, I'm Frank Sutter.
You must be Gina's father.

590
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:35,588
Yep! Yep!
That's exactly who I am.

591
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:38,856
<i>By cracky.
Pa, Pa Kettle!</i>

592
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:43,195
Oh, oh, my God!
I've fallen and I can't get up!

593
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:46,531
- Daddy? Stop it!
- Oh, you broke my Depends.

594
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:50,198
- Take care of that ankle. I gotta go.
- How about some lemonade?

595
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:54,642
Frank, Frank! Don't go!
You can help me eat!

596
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:59,978
<i>- No, no, no, Frank. Frank!
- You can hold the utensil...</i>

597
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,348
<i>You spineless, selfish maggot!</i>

598
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:04,478
Telephone.

599
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:06,681
I heard it!
Geez!

600
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:08,781
- Police work!
- Yes, I'm not deaf!

601
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:11,953
- Oh, the pain must be excruciating.
- Just shut your trap!

602
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:14,292
- I ran my ass all over town for you!
- Shush, shush, quiet!

603
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,298
- Hello?
- Pam? It's Kate.

604
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:19,130
- Hi! How are ya?
- Oh, not too good.

605
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:23,571
- What's the matter?
- Larry and I are getting divorced.

606
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:27,508
- I needed to talk to someone.
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.

607
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:30,978
- Are you okay? Are you at the house?
- Yeah.

608
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:35,848
- I'm sorry, Pam.
- Hey, don't be sorry. Where's Larry?

609
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:39,184
He left. I don't know.
I think he went to Henry's.

610
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:44,216
<i>- Are the kids with you?
- No, they're staying with my parents for the week.</i>

611
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:49,026
<i>- Kate, are you and Larry still seeing that counselor?
- No.</i>

612
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:52,034
<i>- Oh!
- Pam, I don't want to make it work anymore.</i>

613
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:56,095
<i>I'm sick of making it work. Larry's
a son-of-a-bitch. And I hate him.</i>

614
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:59,870
Will Larry and Kate stay together
or will they get divorced?

615
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:03,504
Shh, shh, shh!
Please! Larry's a pig!

616
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,912
Oh, and Kate's
an angel, right?

617
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:11,284
Kate is a woman; Larry is a man.
Need I say more? I rest my case.

618
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:15,757
This is really fabulous. I mean this
whole thing of being able to hear.

619
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:18,385
I feel a teeny bit guilty,
but I'm really enjoying it.

620
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:20,725
<i>Don't go native on me...</i>

621
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:22,924
- Aaah!
- Get down.

622
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:26,435
What? What?

623
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:29,301
<i>Get down.</i>

624
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:34,872
Chris!
What happened?

625
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,481
Somebody's out there.

626
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:43,576
Oh, God. Oh, God.
I hate this part. Chris! Bill!

627
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:50,122
<i>- What do you see?
- I don't know!</i>

628
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,964
I'm gonna circle
around back.

629
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:15,215
Cover me.
I'm taking a bath.

630
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:30,198
<i>Hello? Hello!</i>

631
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:34,260
Hi! I just rented the house next
door. My name is Chris Lecce.

632
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:38,899
Yeah, I saw you yesterday.
I'm Barbara Burnside.

633
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:41,500
Did you lose a baseball?

634
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:44,411
What did it break?

635
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:47,882
<i>- A window.
- Kitchen window?</i>

636
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:52,354
Ronnie!
Ronnie!

637
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:56,552
He always hides when he thinks he's
in for it. This is his responsibility.

638
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,753
It's really no big deal.

639
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:02,320
Do you mind
coming with me, please?

640
00:55:16,743 --> 00:55:22,909
- Phone! Somebody get the...
Somebody get the phone!

641
00:55:22,983 --> 00:55:26,282
<i>Spread a little lovin'
and we'll keep movin'on</i>

642
00:55:26,353 --> 00:55:28,878
Somethin' always happens
whenever we're together

643
00:55:28,956 --> 00:55:31,982
We get a happy feelin'
when we're singing a song

644
00:55:32,059 --> 00:55:34,789
Travellin' around there's
a song that we're singin'

645
00:55:34,862 --> 00:55:38,263
Uh-uh
Come on, get happy

646
00:55:38,332 --> 00:55:40,527
<i>- Danny got Reuben
to sell our songs</i>

647
00:55:44,805 --> 00:55:50,266
- Somebody get the phone!
I'm sleeping!

648
00:55:52,813 --> 00:55:55,907
- Yeah?
- Could I speak to Det. Lecce, please?

649
00:55:55,983 --> 00:55:58,417
- Maria?
- Bill?

650
00:55:58,485 --> 00:56:00,453
Yeah.
Where are you?

651
00:56:00,521 --> 00:56:04,082
- I'm at my mother's.
- Chris told me what happened.

652
00:56:04,157 --> 00:56:06,091
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

653
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:08,627
My partner
misses you.

654
00:56:08,695 --> 00:56:11,425
Is he there?

655
00:56:11,498 --> 00:56:14,592
Yeah, um... Look, no matter
how much of a jerk he can be,

656
00:56:14,668 --> 00:56:19,298
and believe me,
he can be a jerk, I know,

657
00:56:19,373 --> 00:56:24,333
he absolutely, totally
adores you and loves you.

658
00:56:24,411 --> 00:56:28,575
Listen, you don't have to tell me,
but, um... is there another guy?

659
00:56:28,649 --> 00:56:30,674
Did he tell you
that was the reason?

660
00:56:30,751 --> 00:56:33,185
Oh, no, no!
I just thought, maybe...

661
00:56:33,253 --> 00:56:38,122
You know, I start talking
and... Forget it.

662
00:56:38,191 --> 00:56:41,092
- I'll, I'll get him, okay? I'll be right back.
- Thanks.

663
00:56:41,161 --> 00:56:43,755
<i>Chris!</i>

664
00:56:55,842 --> 00:56:58,310
I don't believe this.

665
00:56:58,378 --> 00:57:01,040
<i>There's a song
that we're singin'</i>

666
00:57:01,114 --> 00:57:06,381
<i>Come on, get happy</i>

667
00:57:09,089 --> 00:57:12,490
Hi, um...
I can't find him.

668
00:57:16,463 --> 00:57:18,522
Where is he?

669
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:21,796
- I-I'll have him call you.
- Where did he go?

670
00:57:21,868 --> 00:57:26,669
The funniest thing happened. This, uh,
baseball went through this window...

671
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:31,336
- and he had to take it next door because he thought...
- Bill. Bill.

672
00:57:31,411 --> 00:57:33,345
No, don't bother,
okay?

673
00:57:33,413 --> 00:57:35,347
Right.

674
00:57:35,415 --> 00:57:37,383
Bye.

675
00:57:44,758 --> 00:57:46,817
I just wanna
get some sleep!

676
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:53,331
Phone!

677
00:57:57,604 --> 00:57:59,538
Telephone!

678
00:57:59,606 --> 00:58:03,667
- Hi, you've reached
the O'Hara residence.

679
00:58:03,744 --> 00:58:06,713
- We can't come to the phone, so please leave a message.
- They're not home.

680
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:09,408
- Thank you.
- Oh, my God, they're not home.

681
00:58:09,483 --> 00:58:12,418
- Where the hell are they?
- I don't know where they are! Where the hell were you?

682
00:58:12,486 --> 00:58:15,853
- Where the hell were you? - I-I was
returning the baseball, that's where.

683
00:58:15,922 --> 00:58:18,117
- Well, I was taking a bath. Excuse me!
- Aw, geez!

684
00:58:18,191 --> 00:58:21,058
<i>What the hell is goin' on? I was tryin'
to sleep! Can't you keep from yelling...</i>

685
00:58:21,128 --> 00:58:23,358
Here, take the equipment.
We're puttin' in a bug.

686
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:25,489
- We're puttin' in a bug.
- Putting in a bug.

687
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:35,365
Fine.

688
00:59:34,167 --> 00:59:36,135
Chris!

689
00:59:36,203 --> 00:59:39,297
<i>Chris. They're coming.</i>

690
00:59:39,372 --> 00:59:43,308
Bill.
Bill!

691
00:59:43,376 --> 00:59:46,106
Come on,
come on.

692
01:00:09,569 --> 01:00:11,560
The bag!

693
01:00:24,084 --> 01:00:26,075
They're coming.

694
01:00:42,102 --> 01:00:44,036
Hi, there.

695
01:00:44,104 --> 01:00:46,538
- Hi!
- Oh, look, it's, uh...

696
01:00:46,606 --> 01:00:48,540
- Gina.
- Gina!

697
01:00:48,608 --> 01:00:51,873
- What are you doing here?
- I just stopped by...

698
01:00:51,945 --> 01:00:54,209
here...
at your house...

699
01:00:54,281 --> 01:00:57,375
today to...
invite you to dinner.

700
01:00:57,450 --> 01:01:00,214
I was in the shower,
in fact, and I thought to myself...

701
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:02,380
those people next door are lovely,
why not some dinner?

702
01:01:02,455 --> 01:01:04,389
- Can I take that for you?
- No, no.

703
01:01:04,457 --> 01:01:06,755
Please?
lt'd be my pleasure.

704
01:01:12,165 --> 01:01:14,793
<i>Yes!</i>

705
01:01:18,305 --> 01:01:23,072
Yes, isn't it great? And I was
thinking, perhaps, dinner sometime soon?

706
01:01:23,143 --> 01:01:25,077
- Like, when?
- Like, uh...

707
01:01:25,145 --> 01:01:28,876
I was thinking that...
Like, tonight.

708
01:01:28,949 --> 01:01:32,077
<i>- Yes.
- Yes?</i>

709
01:01:32,152 --> 01:01:35,918
Yes. Thank God. All right, then.

710
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:52,104
What's happenin', Tom?

711
01:01:52,172 --> 01:01:55,005
- Do I know you?
- Not important.

712
01:01:55,075 --> 01:01:57,168
<i>- What do you want?
- I want you to get back in the car.</i>

713
01:01:57,244 --> 01:01:59,235
- What?
- We need to talk.

714
01:01:59,312 --> 01:02:01,246
- Get lost.
- Whoa, wait a second. Hold it.

715
01:02:01,314 --> 01:02:03,475
You're making my life
very difficult.

716
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:07,577
I need to know where she is
and you need to tell me.

717
01:02:07,654 --> 01:02:09,588
You stupid
son-of-a-bitch.

718
01:02:09,656 --> 01:02:13,285
What the hell are you doin' here?
Are you crazy?

719
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:16,158
We can still
get in the car.

720
01:02:16,229 --> 01:02:18,789
I don't know
where the hell she is.

721
01:02:18,865 --> 01:02:21,766
When I find out,
I'll call.

722
01:02:21,835 --> 01:02:24,201
Good.
Thank you.

723
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:29,607
Keep the hell
away from me.

724
01:02:29,676 --> 01:02:32,144
Tommy!

725
01:02:32,212 --> 01:02:34,840
Just remember,
I do know where you are.

726
01:02:34,915 --> 01:02:36,849
<i>- Okay?
- Okay, uh...</i>

727
01:02:36,917 --> 01:02:39,943
<i>I have a home security business.
I started it ten years ago.</i>

728
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:42,454
<i>We broke up after two years of
living together. Her name was Louise.</i>

729
01:02:42,522 --> 01:02:45,389
<i>I have one son, Bill, by my
first marriage. She's dead.</i>

730
01:02:45,458 --> 01:02:47,392
She wanted to get married;
I didn't. We should trade.

731
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:49,394
You shouldn't
have any problem remembering this.

732
01:02:49,462 --> 01:02:51,828
- Ha-ha-ha. Did you know that you
were illegitimate? - Thank God.

733
01:02:51,898 --> 01:02:55,026
Now, my first wife's name
was, uh...

734
01:02:55,101 --> 01:02:58,502
- Cheryl.
- Ah! Don't help me! Cheryl, it was Cheryl.

735
01:02:58,571 --> 01:03:00,698
<i>Sometimes I really
miss Mom, don't you?</i>

736
01:03:00,774 --> 01:03:02,708
Just don't take any longer
in there than you have to.

737
01:03:02,776 --> 01:03:06,337
<i>- Put the bug in and get the hell out.
- Home before midnight, Pop.</i>

738
01:03:06,413 --> 01:03:08,347
Forty-five minutes,
that's all you're gonna get.

739
01:03:08,415 --> 01:03:10,815
Then I'm gonna puke on the table;
they're gonna come home.

740
01:03:10,884 --> 01:03:12,818
- Forty-five minutes, check your watch.
- Hey, hey, hey!

741
01:03:12,886 --> 01:03:15,650
- Don't you even think of touching my hors d'oeuvres.
- Hey, stop that!

742
01:03:15,722 --> 01:03:18,919
- Let me tell you something, Miss Assistant District Attorney.
- Do not use that tone with me.

743
01:03:18,992 --> 01:03:22,257
If this assignment gets blown,
I want to go on record right now...

744
01:03:22,329 --> 01:03:25,696
that this is the most stupid,
dim-witted, idiotic,

745
01:03:25,765 --> 01:03:30,395
moronic piece of putrefied garbage that I
have ever, in my entire professional career,

746
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:32,904
<i>ever had the displeasure
of being involved with.</i>

747
01:03:32,973 --> 01:03:35,703
- Really? And?
- Really.

748
01:03:35,775 --> 01:03:40,075
<i>Re... And I don't like the panties
hanging on the rod!</i>

749
01:03:40,146 --> 01:03:44,048
Excuse me, Detective,
but the dryer was not working.

750
01:03:44,117 --> 01:03:47,177
You pathetic
Steven Seagal wanna-be.

751
01:03:47,253 --> 01:03:49,380
<i>Walkin'around all dressed in black.</i>

752
01:03:49,456 --> 01:03:52,550
You think it's funny? You're even
worse than he is, do ya know that?

753
01:03:52,625 --> 01:03:54,889
You're just a flunky;
you're a sidekick.

754
01:03:54,961 --> 01:03:57,395
That's what you are.
He's Fred, you're Barney.

755
01:03:57,464 --> 01:03:59,762
He's Johnny Carson,
you're Ed McMahon!

756
01:03:59,833 --> 01:04:03,769
- That's it!
Nobody calls me Ed McMahon!

757
01:04:03,837 --> 01:04:06,897
Here is my gun,
here is my badge...

758
01:04:06,973 --> 01:04:09,271
<i>- and here is me quitting!
- Me too.</i>

759
01:04:09,342 --> 01:04:12,743
<i>- You can't quit. Oh, yeah, right.
- Watch us.</i>

760
01:04:12,812 --> 01:04:16,043
- What are you gonna do, leave me here alone?
- Yes!

761
01:04:16,116 --> 01:04:18,744
All right, I'm sorry!
I am sorry.

762
01:04:18,818 --> 01:04:21,548
- Really?
- I'm sorry about this whole thing.

763
01:04:21,621 --> 01:04:26,217
I'm sorry that you feel this assignment is
beneath you. I am sorry I brought my dog.

764
01:04:26,292 --> 01:04:29,921
I am sorry that I was taking a bath when I
should have been watching the O'Hara's house.

765
01:04:29,996 --> 01:04:33,932
But most of all...
I am sorry we are not getting along!

766
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,730
So if you wanna leave,
just leave!

767
01:04:36,803 --> 01:04:39,738
This is not working.

768
01:04:39,806 --> 01:04:41,740
You just go
and I'll cover for you.

769
01:04:41,808 --> 01:04:46,108
I'll say, maybe, that one of your alarms
went off and you had to go, okay? Just go.

770
01:04:46,179 --> 01:04:49,012
You think that we're gonna be
guilty and we're gonna stay.

771
01:04:49,082 --> 01:04:51,846
I have a job
that I have to do...

772
01:04:51,918 --> 01:04:56,116
and you guys can just decide
what's right for you to do, okay?

773
01:04:56,189 --> 01:04:58,589
Oh, look at her.
She's doing the shoulder thing.

774
01:04:58,658 --> 01:05:02,424
- We're bein' had, right? We're outta here!
- Absolutely.

775
01:05:14,274 --> 01:05:16,265
<i>Gina...</i>

776
01:05:16,342 --> 01:05:19,607
They're here!
I knew you guys would stay.

777
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:22,614
Bill, I want you to go in there
and put in the bug. You know why?

778
01:05:22,682 --> 01:05:26,345
You're the best bugger I ever met. Chris,
we have been married for five years.

779
01:05:26,419 --> 01:05:28,785
I love you;
you love me.

780
01:05:28,855 --> 01:05:31,619
- This is gonna be fabulous!
- Wait, wait, wait.

781
01:05:31,691 --> 01:05:34,125
<i>- Be right there! Gotta freshen up.
- Where are you going?</i>

782
01:05:34,194 --> 01:05:37,493
- Forty-five minutes.
- Just a... Just a minute.

783
01:05:37,564 --> 01:05:40,465
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait. Where are you...

784
01:05:40,533 --> 01:05:44,902
Jesus Christ, I can't believe
I got myself hooked into this one.

785
01:05:48,241 --> 01:05:50,869
- Goddamn it. Hi!
- Hi!

786
01:05:50,944 --> 01:05:53,071
- Here. Welcome.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

787
01:05:53,146 --> 01:05:55,671
That's very nice. Thanks a lot.
Hi, glad to see you.

788
01:05:55,748 --> 01:05:57,682
- Hi, good to see you.
- Thanks for having us.

789
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:00,810
Come on in. What would you, uh...
What would you like to drink?

790
01:06:00,887 --> 01:06:04,323
- Cheryl will be down in just one second.
- Uh, Cheryl?

791
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:08,656
Cheryl. Cheryl, my, my, um...

792
01:06:08,728 --> 01:06:12,824
<i>Sorry. Cheryl is the name
of my first dead wife...</i>

793
01:06:12,899 --> 01:06:15,094
<i>- Ah.
- Sometimes, I call Gina Cheryl.</i>

794
01:06:15,168 --> 01:06:17,329
Please, don't tell her
I said that because it's, uh...

795
01:06:17,403 --> 01:06:19,701
No, not a word.

796
01:06:19,772 --> 01:06:22,036
Please.
What can I get you to drink?

797
01:06:22,108 --> 01:06:24,440
- Oh, uh, scotch and water for me, thanks.
- Okeydoke.

798
01:06:24,511 --> 01:06:27,742
- I'll take a vodka if you've got it. Straight up?
- You got it.

799
01:06:27,814 --> 01:06:31,215
<i>- Honey? Pam and Brian are here.
- I'll be right there.</i>

800
01:06:31,284 --> 01:06:34,879
<i>- Would you like something to drink, dear?
- I'll have the usual, honey.</i>

801
01:06:34,954 --> 01:06:36,922
The usual.

802
01:06:38,791 --> 01:06:41,282
His first dead wife?

803
01:06:41,361 --> 01:06:45,161
I told you I didn't wanna be here to begin
with. I hope we brought 'em cheap wine.

804
01:07:24,537 --> 01:07:26,471
Dude.

805
01:07:35,915 --> 01:07:40,079
Scotch and water.

806
01:07:40,153 --> 01:07:43,452
And vodka straight up.

807
01:07:43,523 --> 01:07:46,959
And, uh...
The usual, the usual.

808
01:07:47,026 --> 01:07:49,654
Oh, Jesus.

809
01:07:52,031 --> 01:07:55,262
Ah!
Gin and tonic.

810
01:07:55,335 --> 01:08:00,602
Okay. Gin...

811
01:08:00,673 --> 01:08:03,608
and tonic.

812
01:08:05,378 --> 01:08:08,973
<i>- Hello, how are you? Lovely of you to...
- Hi, how are you? Fine.</i>

813
01:08:09,048 --> 01:08:11,346
- Do you like chili?
- Chili?

814
01:08:11,417 --> 01:08:13,351
- Yes?
- I love chili. Oh, yeah, I love it.

815
01:08:13,419 --> 01:08:16,183
- All right. Here we have scotch for Brian...
- Oh, thank you.

816
01:08:16,256 --> 01:08:18,520
- and a vodka straight for Pam,
- Thanks.

817
01:08:18,591 --> 01:08:20,718
<i>and a gin for Gina.</i>

818
01:08:20,793 --> 01:08:23,489
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Aren't you drinking, Chris?

819
01:08:23,563 --> 01:08:26,123
No, no, not anymore.
Too many funny hats.

820
01:08:28,034 --> 01:08:31,492
<i>Oh, honey, honey.</i>

821
01:08:31,571 --> 01:08:34,131
- Oh, honey. I'm...
Did I make that too strong?

822
01:08:34,207 --> 01:08:36,641
- No, it's fine, thank you.
- Oh, oh, I'm really...

823
01:08:36,709 --> 01:08:38,643
<i>Honey.</i>

824
01:08:38,711 --> 01:08:40,838
- Should I try again?
- Thank you. No, no, no, sweetheart.

825
01:08:40,913 --> 01:08:42,847
- Okay. Okay.
- It's fine, really.

826
01:08:42,915 --> 01:08:45,179
So tell me, uh...

827
01:08:45,251 --> 01:08:47,481
- Where's your son, uh... Bill.
- Bill.

828
01:08:47,553 --> 01:08:50,317
<i>- Bill! Actually, he went out for a little while.
- Bill, yes.</i>

829
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:53,416
Yeah, he should be back
in about, um, 37 minutes.

830
01:09:01,234 --> 01:09:03,168
How long have you two
lived here?

831
01:09:03,236 --> 01:09:04,999
- Five years.
- Yeah, about five years.

832
01:09:05,071 --> 01:09:07,335
Cute, yes.

833
01:09:07,407 --> 01:09:09,875
<i>Actually, we just spend the summer
and the weekends here.</i>

834
01:09:09,942 --> 01:09:13,105
- Oh, the summers here are incredible!
- You'll love it.

835
01:09:13,179 --> 01:09:15,044
You, uh, keep a place
in the city?

836
01:09:15,114 --> 01:09:17,048
- Um-hmm. Lake Washington. -
Um-hmm. We love being near the water.

837
01:09:17,116 --> 01:09:19,050
- We spent ten years in Las Vegas.
- Oh!

838
01:09:19,118 --> 01:09:22,781
<i>- Vegas! Really? Honey, they're from Vegas.
- Yeah.</i>

839
01:09:22,855 --> 01:09:25,517
- Uh, would you like another drink?
- Yes.

840
01:09:25,591 --> 01:09:27,855
<i>- Pam?
- I would love one. A drink would be great.</i>

841
01:09:27,927 --> 01:09:30,828
- Honey?
- No, no. Thank you.

842
01:09:33,166 --> 01:09:35,691
Bill?

843
01:09:38,504 --> 01:09:40,438
Bill?

844
01:09:42,041 --> 01:09:43,975
Bill?
God!

845
01:09:45,545 --> 01:09:49,037
You know, sometimes
it is so peaceful here that...

846
01:09:49,115 --> 01:09:52,846
we... never...

847
01:09:58,391 --> 01:10:00,985
Honey?

848
01:10:04,697 --> 01:10:06,995
Drinks! Ha!

849
01:11:08,027 --> 01:11:10,689
- Well, this certainly looks delicious.
- Thank you so much.

850
01:11:10,763 --> 01:11:15,996
- Wonderful.
- Brian was telling us before that they're originally from Chicago.

851
01:11:16,068 --> 01:11:19,401
<i>- Oh, Chicago.
- Chicago.</i>

852
01:11:19,472 --> 01:11:22,339
<i>- Oh, Chicago! We love Chicago.
- Oh, really?</i>

853
01:11:22,408 --> 01:11:24,342
<i>Well, you can have it.</i>

854
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:26,469
<i>Gina, this all looks
absolutely delicious.</i>

855
01:11:26,546 --> 01:11:28,514
<i>- Would you excuse me, please?
- Yes, honey.</i>

856
01:11:28,581 --> 01:11:29,878
- Sure.
- Sure.

857
01:11:32,618 --> 01:11:35,382
<i>The chili's fabulous.
Oh, I bet it is. It looks...</i>

858
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,358
- How long have you and Chris been married?
- Five years.

859
01:11:43,429 --> 01:11:46,159
- But you know Chris was married before.
- Oh, I know.

860
01:11:46,232 --> 01:11:49,827
He must have started young.
Bill's, what, about late 20s?

861
01:11:49,902 --> 01:11:51,836
- Thirty-two. Um-hmm.
- Thirty-two?

862
01:11:51,904 --> 01:11:53,838
- How old's Chris?
- Forty-five.

863
01:11:56,909 --> 01:11:59,400
Did I say 45?

864
01:11:59,479 --> 01:12:02,710
- I meant 55. Chris is fifty...
- Oh!

865
01:12:02,782 --> 01:12:06,218
- He's the speed limit. That's
exactly what he is. - Fifty-five!

866
01:12:06,285 --> 01:12:08,219
- The big five-five.
- Yes! No kidding.

867
01:12:08,287 --> 01:12:10,221
- That is amazing. I can't believe he's 55.
- Really?

868
01:12:10,289 --> 01:12:12,587
- He doesn't look 55, does he?
- No, I thought he was much younger.

869
01:12:12,658 --> 01:12:16,560
- Actually, it came a surprise to me, too, at first.
- I'll bet it did.

870
01:12:16,629 --> 01:12:19,792
Yes, it did.
Brian, how's the chili?

871
01:12:19,866 --> 01:12:23,063
<i>- Yes, it... I'm...
- Yes?</i>

872
01:12:23,135 --> 01:12:25,433
<i>- You must save room for meat loaf.
- Oh.</i>

873
01:12:25,505 --> 01:12:28,736
- It's armadillo.
- Yes.

874
01:12:28,808 --> 01:12:31,436
<i>- Pam? These are corn flakes.
- Yeah?</i>

875
01:12:31,511 --> 01:12:34,036
<i>- Oh. Get outta here.
- Yes. They're corn flakes.</i>

876
01:12:34,113 --> 01:12:37,048
<i>Not much
of an armadillo eater, but I'll try it.</i>

877
01:12:37,116 --> 01:12:40,415
No, no, Brian, it's meat loaf.
It's just shaped that way.

878
01:12:49,962 --> 01:12:51,896
Bill.

879
01:12:55,801 --> 01:12:57,735
Bill.

880
01:13:02,909 --> 01:13:05,742
Bill?

881
01:13:14,253 --> 01:13:18,754
Bill.

882
01:13:20,993 --> 01:13:23,188
Oh! Oh!

883
01:13:23,262 --> 01:13:25,196
Shit!

884
01:13:30,269 --> 01:13:33,102
<i>You know, Brian and I...</i>

885
01:13:33,172 --> 01:13:36,164
<i>- have been married almost ten years.
- No!</i>

886
01:13:36,242 --> 01:13:39,211
<i>- I can hardly believe it.
- That is just so wonderful.</i>

887
01:13:39,278 --> 01:13:42,372
<i>- Thank you.
- You know, marriage isn't always easy.</i>

888
01:13:42,448 --> 01:13:44,678
Come on. Ours hasn't been
that bad, has it?

889
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:47,480
- Oh, honey, I wasn't talking about ours.
- Okay. All right.

890
01:13:47,553 --> 01:13:50,147
- We have a couple of friends who are splitting up.
- Oh.

891
01:13:50,222 --> 01:13:53,157
For the umpteenth time. I don't know
why they just don't get it over with.

892
01:13:53,225 --> 01:13:55,284
I'm sure if it was that easy
they would.

893
01:13:55,361 --> 01:13:57,659
- It's never that easy when kids are involved.
- Excuse me,

894
01:13:57,730 --> 01:14:01,894
but it's my opinion that it's harder on the
kids when people like that stay together.

895
01:14:01,968 --> 01:14:05,870
- But you have to try, honey.
- Well, of course, dear, you have to try.

896
01:14:05,938 --> 01:14:08,463
They should try.
But if it's not working,

897
01:14:08,541 --> 01:14:10,975
nothing they do is gonna
make it right, now is it?

898
01:14:11,043 --> 01:14:14,740
<i>Beside, Kate is a real bitch. I wouldn't
be married to her for ten seconds.</i>

899
01:14:14,814 --> 01:14:19,649
- Kate is not that bad.
- Kate is a friend of yours, and I'd rather not get into it.

900
01:14:19,719 --> 01:14:23,655
Far be it for me to interrupt, however,
it's never just one person's fault, is it?

901
01:14:23,723 --> 01:14:26,988
I'm sure Larry bears just
as much responsibility as Kate.

902
01:14:27,059 --> 01:14:31,120
Well, excuse me, but I've known Larry
longer than the both of you.

903
01:14:36,235 --> 01:14:39,102
You know
Kate and Larry?

904
01:14:39,171 --> 01:14:43,608
Well, um... I don't
know them, actually, no.

905
01:14:43,676 --> 01:14:46,509
You've met them?

906
01:14:46,579 --> 01:14:49,673
Not exactly.

907
01:14:49,749 --> 01:14:53,480
- How do you not exactly meet somebody?
- Hmm?

908
01:15:09,101 --> 01:15:12,764
Oh, honey!
Ha-ha.

909
01:15:12,838 --> 01:15:17,298
Oh, uh...
The bathroom faucet got all, uh...

910
01:15:17,376 --> 01:15:20,812
You know, spritz me and I had
to change. So what did I miss?

911
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,815
Do you know
Kate and Larry Sawyer?

912
01:15:23,883 --> 01:15:26,784
Kate and Larry Sawyer.

913
01:15:26,852 --> 01:15:30,811
Uh, Kate and Larry Sawyer,
Kate and Larry Sawyer. Um.

914
01:15:30,890 --> 01:15:33,882
Golly, honey, do I know
Kate and Larry Sawyer?

915
01:15:33,959 --> 01:15:37,759
No, sweetheart, you do not
but I do in my own special way...

916
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:39,798
and, honey,
I've decided to tell them.

917
01:15:39,865 --> 01:15:43,323
Oh, no. I don't think that
would be a good idea, dear.

918
01:15:43,402 --> 01:15:44,494
<i>- Yes, sweetheart, yes.
- No, no, no.</i>

919
01:15:44,570 --> 01:15:47,471
<i>- No. No. No. No.
- Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.</i>

920
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:50,737
Yes.

921
01:15:50,810 --> 01:15:53,574
Pam, Brian...

922
01:15:53,646 --> 01:15:55,978
I have the ability
to see things.

923
01:15:57,650 --> 01:16:00,915
I hate to say this.
Some people even say that I'm psychic.

924
01:16:00,986 --> 01:16:04,444
<i>It's strange. Ideas, images,
thoughts, names just pop in my head.</i>

925
01:16:04,523 --> 01:16:07,822
Just before I was thinking
Larry, Kate Sawyer.

926
01:16:07,893 --> 01:16:10,953
I don't know how; I don't know
where. It's frightening, isn't it?

927
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:14,261
<i>I can't even watch Jeopardy.
I know all the answers. It's crazy!</i>

928
01:16:14,333 --> 01:16:16,426
It scares Chris, actually.
It really does.

929
01:16:16,502 --> 01:16:19,471
He doesn't like me to talk about it.
Do you, honey?

930
01:16:19,538 --> 01:16:24,635
No, knock yourself out.

931
01:16:26,612 --> 01:16:29,877
- Telephone!
- Telephone!

932
01:16:29,949 --> 01:16:33,146
You know, I've never met anyone
who could actually do it.

933
01:16:33,219 --> 01:16:35,813
<i>- Oh, I don't do it,
it just sorta happens.</i>

934
01:16:35,888 --> 01:16:38,652
Well, I've gotta do it.
Go to the bathroom. Excuse me.

935
01:16:38,724 --> 01:16:41,887
- Hello?
- Chris?

936
01:16:41,961 --> 01:16:45,158
- Maria?
- You called.

937
01:16:45,231 --> 01:16:48,166
Yeah.
Hold on one second.

938
01:16:48,234 --> 01:16:51,499
- Are you okay?
- Fine. You?

939
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:54,164
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

940
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:57,004
I'm going back
to Veracruz.

941
01:16:57,076 --> 01:16:59,408
- For how long?
- I've been offered a job.

942
01:16:59,478 --> 01:17:02,345
<i>Well, wait a minute,
wait a minute.</i>

943
01:17:02,414 --> 01:17:05,315
<i>Are you talking about
permanently moving?</i>

944
01:17:05,384 --> 01:17:09,047
I'm leaving Friday.

945
01:17:09,121 --> 01:17:14,650
- Are you trying to kill me?
- No, I just want a life.

946
01:17:14,727 --> 01:17:17,696
I want kids and I'm sick
of hearing myself ask for it.

947
01:17:17,763 --> 01:17:20,823
Maria, how do I tell you that I
love you and make you believe it?

948
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:22,527
<i>What do I say?</i>

949
01:17:22,601 --> 01:17:26,037
- Don't.
- No, no, no, just listen to me.

950
01:17:26,105 --> 01:17:28,596
Maria...

951
01:17:28,674 --> 01:17:33,373
l...
I wanna marry you.

952
01:17:33,445 --> 01:17:36,175
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

953
01:17:36,248 --> 01:17:38,773
I know you think I'm only saying
something that I think you wanna hear,

954
01:17:38,851 --> 01:17:40,546
- but I really mean it.
- Chris, don't do it like this.

955
01:17:40,619 --> 01:17:43,213
Chris, don't do it like this.
Not on the phone like this!

956
01:17:43,289 --> 01:17:45,257
All right, it's not on the phone.
Bad idea, bad.

957
01:17:45,324 --> 01:17:49,226
Let's, let's start again,
all right? Just...

958
01:17:49,295 --> 01:17:52,128
<i>I will do anything
I have to do.</i>

959
01:17:52,198 --> 01:17:56,828
Anything at all, no matter how hard it
is. Except it's very hard now to talk.

960
01:17:58,871 --> 01:18:02,967
I want to marry you.
I wanna marry you...

961
01:18:03,042 --> 01:18:06,478
<i>tonight.</i>

962
01:18:06,545 --> 01:18:10,743
I'm willing to leave here.
We'll go to a justice of the peace.

963
01:18:10,816 --> 01:18:12,750
- I gotta go.
- No, wait!

964
01:18:12,818 --> 01:18:15,116
No, no, no, wait!
Aw...

965
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:25,112
I'm sensing...
you have been very stressed lately.

966
01:19:25,190 --> 01:19:28,819
- Oh, you're right.
- Yes, I know, very stressed.

967
01:19:28,894 --> 01:19:31,658
Something concerning...

968
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:35,063
Brian and another woman.

969
01:19:35,134 --> 01:19:39,230
Yes, Pam, I feel it.
It's... a woman from his past.

970
01:19:39,305 --> 01:19:41,330
- I don't know the nature of the relationship.
- Honey.

971
01:19:41,407 --> 01:19:44,069
- One second. It could be sexual, it may not.
- Honey, honey. Could l...

972
01:19:44,143 --> 01:19:46,168
- One second, sweetheart.
- No, no, honey.

973
01:19:46,245 --> 01:19:48,179
- Honey, sweetheart, darling.
- It's someone that he... Wait.

974
01:19:48,247 --> 01:19:50,807
- Yes?
- Honey, this is the first time...

975
01:19:50,883 --> 01:19:54,319
the O'Haras have been over for dinner and I
think, maybe, it's not such a good idea that,

976
01:19:54,386 --> 01:19:57,412
you know, they think this kind
of thing happens all the time.

977
01:19:57,489 --> 01:20:01,823
- You know, you're right. I'm sorry. I really am.
- It's okay.

978
01:20:01,894 --> 01:20:04,158
All right. Sweetheart,
was that Bill on the phone?

979
01:20:04,229 --> 01:20:06,857
- No, just some public opinion poll.
- I knew that.

980
01:20:06,932 --> 01:20:10,231
- I knew it was a public opinion poll.
- Excuse me. Pam?

981
01:20:10,302 --> 01:20:13,032
Honey, I've developed a bit of a
headache and I think we should be going.

982
01:20:13,105 --> 01:20:16,438
- Thanks for having us over.
- Oh, no, you haven't had dessert yet.

983
01:20:16,508 --> 01:20:18,442
- No, no, no, we... No.
- Would you like some aspirin?

984
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:21,377
- Or some Motrin? Or Tylenol or Percodan?
- No. No. No.

985
01:20:21,447 --> 01:20:25,349
- Honey, please, let's go.
- Honey, I told you. The psychic thing flips people out.

986
01:20:25,417 --> 01:20:28,511
- Was that what happened, Pam? Was it the psychic thing?
- Oh, no!

987
01:20:28,587 --> 01:20:31,249
Please, could I ask you,
just give us one more half hour.

988
01:20:31,323 --> 01:20:33,518
- She's been working all day on this dessert.
- I have.

989
01:20:33,592 --> 01:20:37,289
- You won't be sorry. One half hour more, okay?
- Please.

990
01:20:37,363 --> 01:20:39,422
- Okay, fine.
- All right. Great!

991
01:20:39,498 --> 01:20:44,060
Let's move into the living room.
It is such a pleasure to know you two.

992
01:20:44,136 --> 01:20:46,604
- Shh! Shh!
- What?

993
01:20:46,672 --> 01:20:50,233
I heard him at the phone.
- So?

994
01:20:50,309 --> 01:20:52,573
He said that he loved her
and wanted to marry her.

995
01:20:52,644 --> 01:20:54,805
I even know her name. Maria!

996
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,940
"Maria, I love you. Maria, I wanna
marry you." Just like the song.

997
01:20:58,017 --> 01:21:01,214
- I was waitin' for him to start singin' and dancin'.
- Oh, my God.

998
01:21:01,286 --> 01:21:04,084
This guy has got balls
this big.

999
01:21:04,156 --> 01:21:06,420
- She calls right here, right under her nose.
- Oh!

1000
01:21:06,492 --> 01:21:09,393
Some psychic she is. Her own husband
is in love with a woman named Maria,

1001
01:21:09,461 --> 01:21:12,919
- and she doesn't even know it!
- I feel so sorry for her.

1002
01:21:12,998 --> 01:21:14,898
They are not psychic;
they're psychotic.

1003
01:21:14,967 --> 01:21:18,403
What kind of a woman makes an armadillo meat
loaf and God knows what was in those eggs.

1004
01:21:18,470 --> 01:21:20,404
- Pam.
- What?

1005
01:21:20,472 --> 01:21:23,600
I wouldn't be surprised if this guy killed
his first wife. We gotta get outta here.

1006
01:21:23,675 --> 01:21:25,802
- Let's go.
- No! No, no, no, we...

1007
01:21:25,878 --> 01:21:28,972
<i>- Be right there!
- Knowing these two, they will bring the dessert to our house.</i>

1008
01:21:29,048 --> 01:21:32,108
- Listen, we'll sit down and eat fast.
- Fast, fast! Eat fast!

1009
01:21:32,184 --> 01:21:36,314
<i>- All we got's ice cream sandwiches.
- We'll tell 'em it's homemade.</i>

1010
01:21:36,388 --> 01:21:39,357
<i>- We need somethin' else.
- Reddi-Wip.</i>

1011
01:21:39,425 --> 01:21:43,020
Very good. It was a good cover
with the psychic thing.

1012
01:21:43,095 --> 01:21:45,290
- You really think so?
- Yeah.

1013
01:21:45,364 --> 01:21:47,355
Thank you.
How'd you get all wet?

1014
01:21:47,433 --> 01:21:50,493
I snuck over to their house
looking for Bill.

1015
01:21:50,569 --> 01:21:52,503
- Yeah?
- And the sprinklers went off.

1016
01:21:52,571 --> 01:21:54,505
- Oh, God. Did you find him?
- No, he wasn't there.

1017
01:21:54,573 --> 01:21:56,541
- He wasn't there?
- No.

1018
01:21:56,608 --> 01:21:58,803
Give me that.

1019
01:21:58,877 --> 01:22:00,970
I wouldn't worry too much. We're
not gonna be invited over for dinner.

1020
01:22:01,046 --> 01:22:04,709
- They already think we're nuts.
- We're a perfectly normal couple. Go.

1021
01:22:04,783 --> 01:22:07,980
"I scream, you scream.
We all scream for ice cream."

1022
01:22:08,053 --> 01:22:09,987
- Great.
- Oh, thank you.

1023
01:22:10,055 --> 01:22:12,819
- You're really gonna like this. It's a specialty.
- Oh, honey,

1024
01:22:12,891 --> 01:22:14,882
- Doesn't this look great?
- Oh, yeah, looks real good.

1025
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:18,157
Oh, mmm, this is wonderful. You're
gonna have to give me the recipe.

1026
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:20,323
<i>- I will.
- Okay.</i>

1027
01:22:20,399 --> 01:22:23,129
Oh, it's terrific.

1028
01:22:28,874 --> 01:22:32,571
<i>Mmm. Mmm!</i>

1029
01:22:35,581 --> 01:22:37,845
Oh, God.
Headache, honey?

1030
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:39,679
<i>Honey, honey.</i>

1031
01:22:39,751 --> 01:22:41,685
I think we'd better...

1032
01:22:41,753 --> 01:22:44,586
- I think we're gonna go home.
- I think it's time for us to go. Thank you very much.

1033
01:22:44,656 --> 01:22:46,590
<i>- No! No, no, no!
- No, no, no.</i>

1034
01:22:46,658 --> 01:22:48,592
No, no, really,
we have to go.

1035
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:51,823
No, really, we... I have
an early tee time tomorrow morning.

1036
01:22:51,897 --> 01:22:55,162
Thanks very much
for a very interesting evening.

1037
01:22:55,234 --> 01:22:57,361
If you could just... If you
could just... If you could just...

1038
01:22:57,436 --> 01:22:59,404
Oh, the hell with this.
I'm goin' out there to find Bill.

1039
01:22:59,471 --> 01:23:02,031
Get your badge.
They'll never believe you're a cop.

1040
01:23:07,446 --> 01:23:10,040
- Oh, my God.
- Did you call the police?

1041
01:23:10,115 --> 01:23:12,049
- No.
- Lu, you've gotta call the police.

1042
01:23:12,117 --> 01:23:15,211
If I tell the police
they'll take me back to testify.

1043
01:23:15,287 --> 01:23:19,018
- I have to leave.
- What about him? What are you gonna do with him?

1044
01:23:20,792 --> 01:23:23,522
- I'll have to kill him.
- Hmm?

1045
01:23:23,595 --> 01:23:26,758
<i>Brian, talk to her.</i>

1046
01:23:26,832 --> 01:23:29,699
<i>- Shut up.
Wait. Lu, wait a minute.</i>

1047
01:23:29,768 --> 01:23:32,362
What do you mean? You're just gonna
kill him? That's it. You kill him?

1048
01:23:32,437 --> 01:23:35,372
He came here to kill me.

1049
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:38,967
Shut up! Look, if he lives,
he'll tell them that you helped me.

1050
01:23:39,044 --> 01:23:40,978
Then they're
comin' after you.

1051
01:23:41,046 --> 01:23:43,776
Shut up!

1052
01:23:46,118 --> 01:23:48,552
Get up. Get up.
Come on.

1053
01:23:57,496 --> 01:24:00,124
He's probably
havin' a beer somewhere.

1054
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:13,910
Shit.

1055
01:25:04,196 --> 01:25:07,529
Aaaaaaah!

1056
01:26:00,485 --> 01:26:03,045
Try anything,
I'll shoot you. Get out.

1057
01:26:03,121 --> 01:26:05,487
Come on, get up.

1058
01:26:09,294 --> 01:26:12,889
I don't see them.

1059
01:26:12,964 --> 01:26:15,899
Goddamn it.
Must have turned off.

1060
01:26:15,967 --> 01:26:19,198
- Come on, walk!
So how much was I worth, huh?

1061
01:26:19,271 --> 01:26:22,240
$25,000? $30,000?
Huh?

1062
01:26:22,307 --> 01:26:24,241
Keep going.

1063
01:26:24,309 --> 01:26:27,244
You shouldn't have come after me.
You just shouldn't have come.

1064
01:26:27,312 --> 01:26:29,906
I wasn't gonna testify.

1065
01:26:29,981 --> 01:26:34,384
Don't stop! You don't do
anything unless I tell you.

1066
01:26:34,453 --> 01:26:36,648
Maybe you're the guy
that killed Michael. Huh?

1067
01:26:36,722 --> 01:26:38,952
Are you? Did you kill Michael?

1068
01:26:39,024 --> 01:26:41,618
I bet you are,
you son-of-a-bitch!

1069
01:26:41,693 --> 01:26:44,423
I just bet you are.
You killed Michael, didn't you?

1070
01:26:44,496 --> 01:26:46,794
Now I'm gonna kill you.
Get down!

1071
01:26:50,335 --> 01:26:53,930
If you believe in God, you
better pray for forgiveness now.

1072
01:26:54,005 --> 01:26:56,530
Because you got no time left.

1073
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,407
<i>Watch out!</i>

1074
01:27:41,853 --> 01:27:43,753
Go get Bill!

1075
01:27:52,130 --> 01:27:55,031
Hang on, Bill!

1076
01:28:21,993 --> 01:28:24,359
Ah! Okay!

1077
01:28:24,429 --> 01:28:26,590
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1078
01:28:26,665 --> 01:28:28,633
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1079
01:28:41,279 --> 01:28:43,747
Get away
from the dock!

1080
01:28:46,785 --> 01:28:49,777
I'll get it!
I'm gonna get the car!

1081
01:28:53,458 --> 01:28:55,551
- She okay? How about you?
- Yeah.

1082
01:28:55,627 --> 01:28:57,857
- I'm fine. Where's Bill?
- Up there.

1083
01:29:10,642 --> 01:29:13,372
<i>Ah!</i>

1084
01:29:27,993 --> 01:29:31,156
Okay!
I got her!

1085
01:29:41,406 --> 01:29:43,772
Oo-ha!

1086
01:29:43,842 --> 01:29:46,743
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo!

1087
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:08,796
<i>This is the final boarding call
for Flight 610...</i>

1088
01:30:20,445 --> 01:30:23,505
- Yep.
- They found her on one of those islands near Seattle.

1089
01:30:23,582 --> 01:30:25,641
Staying with some family
named O'Hara.

1090
01:30:25,717 --> 01:30:28,311
- She's agreed to testify, am I right?
- I don't know yet.

1091
01:30:28,386 --> 01:30:30,320
<i>We just got the call
from Seattle.</i>

1092
01:30:30,388 --> 01:30:33,118
Don't worry about it. I'm catching
a plane; I'm bringin' her back.

1093
01:30:33,191 --> 01:30:37,958
I need to know where she is right now.
Do you follow me? That woman...

1094
01:30:40,065 --> 01:30:42,226
That woman...
will not testify.

1095
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:46,236
Yeah. I'll call
when I get there. Hey!

1096
01:30:51,076 --> 01:30:53,010
Hello, Tony?

1097
01:30:53,078 --> 01:30:56,047
Yeah.
We got work to do.

1098
01:31:03,421 --> 01:31:05,355
<i>- Yeah, mm-hmm.
- Dr. Gold, it's about Badham.</i>

1099
01:31:05,423 --> 01:31:08,358
- So she's gonna be all right?
- Okay. A broken nose. She'll be fine.

1100
01:31:08,426 --> 01:31:10,951
Thank you very much.

1101
01:31:13,665 --> 01:31:17,897
Miss Delano. Am I glad to see you.
I can't tell you...

1102
01:31:17,969 --> 01:31:20,870
what an experience this has been
for all of us down in Las Vegas.

1103
01:31:20,939 --> 01:31:22,873
We were so relieved...

1104
01:31:22,941 --> 01:31:25,375
when we learned that they had found
you and that you were all right.

1105
01:31:25,443 --> 01:31:28,810
Listen, I know that this has been...

1106
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:32,043
Extremely traumatic for you,
but I'm here to assure you...

1107
01:31:32,117 --> 01:31:34,347
that every precaution
has been taken.

1108
01:31:34,419 --> 01:31:37,252
- We're gonna get you home safe.
- I have to see my friends first.

1109
01:31:37,322 --> 01:31:40,314
Oh, the O'Hara's.
You know what?

1110
01:31:40,392 --> 01:31:43,520
I think it would be safer if we just
went straight from here to the airport.

1111
01:31:43,595 --> 01:31:45,756
They don't even know
what happened to me last night.

1112
01:31:45,830 --> 01:31:47,923
Well, you could
give 'em a phone call.

1113
01:31:47,999 --> 01:31:52,402
<i>No, no, I'm sorry. If I decide
to go back and testify,</i>

1114
01:31:52,470 --> 01:31:54,461
I want to see my friends first.

1115
01:31:57,475 --> 01:31:59,602
Well, I guess, uh,

1116
01:31:59,678 --> 01:32:03,580
- a quick side trip wouldn't do too much harm.
- Not at all.

1117
01:32:03,648 --> 01:32:06,208
<i>- And I'll stay with you until you're on the plane.
- Thanks, Gina.</i>

1118
01:32:41,152 --> 01:32:44,781
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shut up.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1119
01:32:45,990 --> 01:32:48,720
I'll let the dog out.
Will you grab my bag?

1120
01:32:48,793 --> 01:32:52,593
<i>- Got it.
- Whoa.</i>

1121
01:32:52,664 --> 01:32:57,158
<i>Archie! Archie! Archie!</i>

1122
01:32:59,971 --> 01:33:02,599
<i>Archie, stop!</i>

1123
01:33:04,676 --> 01:33:07,042
- Archie, come back here right now!
- Archie!

1124
01:33:07,112 --> 01:33:09,945
<i>- Archie! Archie!
- Stop it, Archie! Don't...</i>

1125
01:33:10,014 --> 01:33:13,916
- Come back here!
- Aw, sic 'em, Archie. Eat the cat.

1126
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,111
<i>So I asked her to marry me.</i>

1127
01:33:17,188 --> 01:33:20,248
- Really? What'd she say?
- She hung up on me.

1128
01:33:20,325 --> 01:33:24,386
- You asked her on the phone?
- Yeah, I asked her on the phone.

1129
01:33:24,462 --> 01:33:29,024
<i>Remember, I'm stuck on an island?
I'm at a dinner party, I can't get away.</i>

1130
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:31,796
Dumb, stupid idea.
I know. Sorry.

1131
01:33:31,870 --> 01:33:34,361
I'm sorry
I ruined my life.

1132
01:33:34,439 --> 01:33:36,407
I'm sorry the suspect
got shot by my gun.

1133
01:33:36,474 --> 01:33:38,601
I'm sorry the Mercedes
went into the bay.

1134
01:33:38,676 --> 01:33:41,543
- What about me gettin' hit?
- Sorry about that too.

1135
01:33:41,613 --> 01:33:44,776
- And me rollin' down the stairs?
- I'm sorry about that too.

1136
01:33:44,849 --> 01:33:47,613
- And my moustache?
- All right!

1137
01:33:47,685 --> 01:33:51,212
What are you gonna do,
blame the deficit on me?

1138
01:33:57,128 --> 01:34:01,497
Just... really sorry
that she walked out on me.

1139
01:34:06,571 --> 01:34:09,972
Dad... we still have
each other.

1140
01:34:10,041 --> 01:34:13,374
Humph.
A reason to live.

1141
01:34:23,421 --> 01:34:26,822
<i>- Chris?
- Hmm?</i>

1142
01:34:26,891 --> 01:34:29,485
<i>They're back.</i>

1143
01:34:29,561 --> 01:34:33,691
<i>- Who?
- Gina and the woman I love.</i>

1144
01:34:34,933 --> 01:34:37,868
<i>- Cops.
- Who's the other one?</i>

1145
01:34:37,936 --> 01:34:39,961
<i>- Lawyer.
- Lawyer.</i>

1146
01:34:40,038 --> 01:34:43,007
- They're going back to Vegas.
- I'm sure gonna miss her.

1147
01:34:43,074 --> 01:34:46,566
<i>- Come on, let's get the hell outta here.
- Another car.</i>

1148
01:34:50,682 --> 01:34:52,843
<i>More cops,
it looks like.</i>

1149
01:34:56,187 --> 01:34:58,417
- In a Mustang?
- Maybe another lawyer.

1150
01:35:04,295 --> 01:35:07,731
<i>This guy's got a gun.
Not a lawyer.</i>

1151
01:35:13,771 --> 01:35:17,070
<i>She had to constantly
smear cream on herself.</i>

1152
01:35:17,141 --> 01:35:20,338
<i>I spent a week
at the Mirage. I loved it there.</i>

1153
01:35:20,411 --> 01:35:23,380
Come on in. Relax a minute.
Take a look at this, will ya?

1154
01:35:42,333 --> 01:35:44,267
<i>- Get down!
- Get down!</i>

1155
01:35:44,335 --> 01:35:48,066
- Get down, there's a man!
- Behind the tree! He's got a gun! Get down!

1156
01:35:48,139 --> 01:35:51,108
<i>- Oh, my God. Oh, my God, it's them!
- What? What?</i>

1157
01:35:51,175 --> 01:35:54,440
- Get down! Get down!
- There's a man! Get down!

1158
01:35:54,512 --> 01:35:57,037
- Brian, it's them! It's those guys that tried to kill me!
- What?

1159
01:35:57,115 --> 01:36:00,573
Everybody, get down!
No, not there! Get up here!

1160
01:36:00,652 --> 01:36:02,916
<i>Do it fast!
Keep your heads down!</i>

1161
01:36:05,957 --> 01:36:09,324
Police! Freeze!

1162
01:36:11,863 --> 01:36:14,832
The idiots are shooting at us.
Stop shooting at us, you idiots.

1163
01:36:16,534 --> 01:36:20,470
They think we're the bad guys.
Show 'em your badge.

1164
01:36:20,538 --> 01:36:23,405
- They're never gonna believe we're cops.
- Gina's there, she'll tell 'em.

1165
01:36:23,474 --> 01:36:25,965
Go on!
Hold it up!

1166
01:36:26,044 --> 01:36:28,308
Wait a minute.
Why don't you show 'em yours?

1167
01:36:28,379 --> 01:36:30,438
<i>You think I'm crazy?</i>

1168
01:36:30,515 --> 01:36:32,449
All right,
all right!

1169
01:36:32,517 --> 01:36:35,645
- Do it together. One, two, three.
- Two, three.

1170
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:39,656
Don't shoot! We're cops!

1171
01:36:39,724 --> 01:36:41,783
<i>Great idea.</i>

1172
01:36:41,859 --> 01:36:44,760
- Can we shoot back?
- What if we kill 'em?

1173
01:36:44,829 --> 01:36:47,320
- What if they kill us?
- Good point.

1174
01:36:47,398 --> 01:36:50,299
Okay. You go,
I'll cover you.

1175
01:36:50,368 --> 01:36:52,302
Go!

1176
01:36:52,370 --> 01:36:55,271
Wait a minute.
Why don't you go, and I cover?

1177
01:36:55,340 --> 01:36:57,467
Because I'm already doing
the covering thing! Go on, go on!

1178
01:36:57,542 --> 01:37:00,602
But you're older.
You got less to live for.

1179
01:37:00,678 --> 01:37:03,238
- Get outta here!
- Don't shoot anybody.

1180
01:37:14,759 --> 01:37:17,319
- Who'd ya see?
- The same men.

1181
01:37:17,395 --> 01:37:19,329
- The ones from last night? Oh, my God.
- Yes.

1182
01:37:19,397 --> 01:37:22,366
- Stop shooting, stop shooting! They're police!
- What?

1183
01:37:22,433 --> 01:37:24,526
They're cops.
Det. Lecce and Reimers out of Seattle.

1184
01:37:24,602 --> 01:37:27,469
They're with me.
Part of the stakeout next door.

1185
01:37:27,538 --> 01:37:31,531
Bullshit! If they're cops, what the
hell are they shootin' at us for?

1186
01:37:31,609 --> 01:37:34,669
- Because you're shooting at them!
- Call for backup.

1187
01:37:42,253 --> 01:37:44,619
Chris, Bill, stop!
I told 'em you're cops!

1188
01:37:52,563 --> 01:37:54,497
Oh, shit.

1189
01:37:54,565 --> 01:37:57,762
- Steve. Steve! Hang in there, buddy.
- I'm all right.

1190
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:12,972
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hang on, Steve.

1191
01:38:36,174 --> 01:38:40,201
- In the basement!
- No, no! I gotta get her outta the house!

1192
01:38:40,278 --> 01:38:42,212
Go!

1193
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:44,840
<i>Tommy.</i>

1194
01:38:44,916 --> 01:38:46,884
You?

1195
01:38:46,951 --> 01:38:50,580
Jesus Christ, am I glad to see you.
I've been goin' nuts here.

1196
01:38:50,655 --> 01:38:53,556
- Where is she?
- She's back there. Upstairs.

1197
01:38:53,624 --> 01:38:55,558
It's great
workin' with you, Tom.

1198
01:39:10,274 --> 01:39:13,368
- You bastard.
- I'm a cop.

1199
01:39:15,012 --> 01:39:17,776
<i>Run to the water. Stay by the shore.</i>

1200
01:39:17,849 --> 01:39:20,943
Don't stop for anything.

1201
01:39:21,018 --> 01:39:23,816
- Go!
- I can't.

1202
01:39:23,888 --> 01:39:26,322
Go!
Jump, goddamn it!

1203
01:39:54,051 --> 01:39:56,349
Ow!

1204
01:39:56,420 --> 01:39:59,981
Throw out your gun!

1205
01:40:00,057 --> 01:40:03,686
Come out with your hands
above your head!

1206
01:40:03,761 --> 01:40:05,854
This is the police.
You're completely surrounded!

1207
01:40:05,930 --> 01:40:08,660
- You got ten seconds!
- No, you got ten seconds!

1208
01:40:08,733 --> 01:40:11,531
You kill her, we kill you.
It's that simple.

1209
01:40:11,602 --> 01:40:14,935
- She's a friend of yours. Want to see her die?
- I'm sorry.

1210
01:40:15,006 --> 01:40:17,201
I'm sorry!

1211
01:40:17,275 --> 01:40:21,336
You see. She's sorry.
Now back off.

1212
01:40:21,412 --> 01:40:24,108
Back the hell off!
Now!

1213
01:40:26,184 --> 01:40:28,880
Ooo, I don't like
what you're thinkin', ace.

1214
01:40:28,953 --> 01:40:32,445
Cool heads, boys.
Cool heads.

1215
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:51,574
Let's talk,
gentlemen.

1216
01:40:51,642 --> 01:40:54,236
<i>- No talk.
- Let's trade here. What do you care?</i>

1217
01:40:54,312 --> 01:40:57,406
<i>You want her alive, right? I don't
care about her, you can have her.</i>

1218
01:40:57,481 --> 01:40:59,574
But I get the other one.
I get who I came for.

1219
01:40:59,650 --> 01:41:01,845
<i>She walks away and I walk away.
It works for me.</i>

1220
01:41:01,919 --> 01:41:05,582
<i>- Shoot her. I don't care. You're not walkin' out of here.
- Nobody's gonna blame you guys.</i>

1221
01:41:05,656 --> 01:41:07,851
But somebody is gonna die,
I promise you that.

1222
01:41:07,925 --> 01:41:10,416
- Oh!
- You got a shot?

1223
01:41:10,494 --> 01:41:11,927
- I got a shot.
- You got nothin'!

1224
01:41:11,996 --> 01:41:14,897
- Take it.
- I'm takin' it. I'm gonna drop this bastard!

1225
01:41:14,966 --> 01:41:18,197
Listen to me. Shut up!
Let's trade here, all right?

1226
01:41:18,269 --> 01:41:20,829
We're runnin' outta time,
boys. Runnin' outta time.

1227
01:41:46,530 --> 01:41:49,795
- He got me. Did you get him?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1228
01:41:49,867 --> 01:41:52,802
- Am I gonna live? Excellent.
- Yeah.

1229
01:41:52,870 --> 01:41:55,805
- Gina? Oh, my God. Is she all right?
- She'll be all right.

1230
01:41:55,873 --> 01:41:57,807
- Are you sure?
- She'll be all right. Yeah.

1231
01:41:57,875 --> 01:42:00,070
- Good dog, Arch. Good dog.
- Oh, good dog.

1232
01:42:08,386 --> 01:42:10,479
- You havin' a good week?
- Perfect.

1233
01:42:10,554 --> 01:42:12,488
- Hey.
- You hurt bad?

1234
01:42:12,556 --> 01:42:16,151
Nah. Winged me, clipped me. Took a
hit in the shoulder. It was nothin'.

1235
01:42:16,227 --> 01:42:18,787
- I'm just glad it wasn't me.
- Yeah, glad it wasn't me.

1236
01:42:18,863 --> 01:42:22,799
I cannot believe I'm about to say this,
but I'm actually gonna miss you guys.

1237
01:42:22,867 --> 01:42:25,495
- A little.
- Yeah, well, we're gonna miss you too.

1238
01:42:25,569 --> 01:42:27,503
- A little less.
- Thank you.

1239
01:42:27,571 --> 01:42:29,505
- The bad news is your dog's okay.
- I know you love him.

1240
01:42:29,573 --> 01:42:31,507
- We gotta go.
- I can feel you love him.

1241
01:42:31,575 --> 01:42:34,669
<i>- Yeah.
- Hey, listen, if I get another assignment like this,</i>

1242
01:42:34,745 --> 01:42:36,975
- how about I give you guys a call?
- No.

1243
01:42:37,048 --> 01:42:39,846
No? Right.
I am gonna sue for custody.

1244
01:42:39,917 --> 01:42:43,512
<i>- For him? Take him. He irritates the hell out of me.
- Yes.</i>

1245
01:42:43,587 --> 01:42:46,021
Hey, you were right.
I do look better without it.

1246
01:42:47,558 --> 01:42:50,686
That's why I shaved mine off.
Because I look better without it.

1247
01:42:50,761 --> 01:42:53,696
<i>No. You shaved yours off
because you look old with it.</i>

1248
01:42:53,764 --> 01:42:56,597
<i>- How old do I look?
- You look like, uh, Santa Claus old.</i>

1249
01:42:56,667 --> 01:42:59,602
<i>- What? That's ridiculous!
- You look like a little old clockmaker.</i>

1250
01:42:59,670 --> 01:43:02,503
You're even starting to smell old.

1251
01:43:08,746 --> 01:43:11,442
- So you wanna go get somethin' to eat?
- No, go home.

1252
01:43:11,515 --> 01:43:14,951
You got a wife and kids.
They miss you. I don't know why.

1253
01:43:17,221 --> 01:43:19,553
Why don't you come over?
You got nothin' to eat here.

1254
01:43:19,623 --> 01:43:22,490
No one to eat with.
You'll get lonely, depressed.

1255
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:24,494
You'll start wondering
what you got to live for.

1256
01:43:24,562 --> 01:43:26,826
I'll have to go downtown,
identify the body.

1257
01:43:26,897 --> 01:43:29,730
Come on, do it for me.

1258
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:34,897
It's only three stories.
I'd just hurt myself. I'll see ya.

1259
01:43:34,972 --> 01:43:37,702
- Okay, Dad.
- Enough with the dad thing.

1260
01:44:14,745 --> 01:44:16,679
<i>Hola?</i>

1261
01:44:16,747 --> 01:44:20,274
<i>Hello, uh,
puedo hablar con Maria.</i>

1262
01:44:20,351 --> 01:44:22,615
<i>- Quien habla?
- It's Chris. Who do you thin...</i>

1263
01:44:22,686 --> 01:44:25,018
Hello?

1264
01:44:52,116 --> 01:44:54,880
Would you marry me?

1265
01:45:02,726 --> 01:45:04,660
Yes.

1266
01:45:16,941 --> 01:45:18,841
Awww!

1267
01:45:24,381 --> 01:45:27,179
<i>- Oooh!
-</i>

1268
01:45:27,251 --> 01:45:31,483
<i>Well</i>

1269
01:45:31,555 --> 01:45:33,648
<i>I don't know
what happened</i>

1270
01:45:33,724 --> 01:45:36,420
<i>How I found you, girl</i>

1271
01:45:36,494 --> 01:45:41,261
<i>I guess it was
my turn to fall</i>

1272
01:45:41,332 --> 01:45:46,099
<i>Thought I was strong
Had my feet on the ground</i>

1273
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:50,436
<i>But your kiss, baby
turned my whole life around</i>

1274
01:45:50,508 --> 01:45:51,975
<i>Baby</i>

1275
01:45:52,042 --> 01:45:56,206
<i>So I guess that love
sweet love</i>

1276
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:59,579
<i>Has a mind of its own</i>

1277
01:46:01,785 --> 01:46:05,949
<i>I know love, sweet love</i>

1278
01:46:06,023 --> 01:46:09,959
<i>Has a mind of its own</i>

1279
01:46:13,030 --> 01:46:15,055
<i>Some people think</i>

1280
01:46:15,132 --> 01:46:18,124
<i>When love
comes their way</i>

1281
01:46:18,202 --> 01:46:22,639
<i>It's always
gonna stay around</i>

1282
01:46:22,706 --> 01:46:25,072
<i>They take it for granted</i>

1283
01:46:25,142 --> 01:46:27,508
<i>Until one day</i>

1284
01:46:27,578 --> 01:46:32,242
<i>That house of love
comes tumblin'down</i>

1285
01:46:32,316 --> 01:46:37,413
<i>Oh, just when I thought
my life was through</i>

1286
01:46:37,488 --> 01:46:42,255
<i>Out of nowhere, baby
I found you</i>

1287
01:46:42,326 --> 01:46:47,354
<i>Yeah, to prove that love
Oh yeah, sweet love</i>

1288
01:46:47,431 --> 01:46:53,028
<i>Has a mind of its own
Uh-huh</i>

1289
01:46:53,103 --> 01:46:57,096
<i>I tell you love
sweet love</i>

1290
01:46:57,174 --> 01:47:02,237
<i>Has a mind of its own</i>

1291
01:47:02,313 --> 01:47:04,406
<i>It can take you to heaven</i>

1292
01:47:04,481 --> 01:47:10,442
<i>Or drive you down
on your knees</i>

1293
01:47:10,521 --> 01:47:15,288
<i>But no matter
what love puts us through</i>

1294
01:47:15,359 --> 01:47:19,796
<i>Girl, you know I wanna
share it all with you</i>

1295
01:47:19,863 --> 01:47:23,663
<i>- I wanna share it all with you, hey
- Hey, hey</i>

1296
01:47:33,644 --> 01:47:37,205
<i>There's no way to control it
It's not just our own</i>

1297
01:47:37,281 --> 01:47:42,878
<i>But it's the best thing
this world's ever known</i>

1298
01:47:42,953 --> 01:47:48,653
<i>Love, sweet love
Has a mind of its own</i>

1299
01:47:48,726 --> 01:47:52,287
<i>Well
I know, I know for sure</i>

1300
01:47:52,363 --> 01:47:55,332
<i>- Love, sweet love
- Love</i>

1301
01:47:55,399 --> 01:47:59,802
<i>Yes, it has a mind
of its own</i>

1302
01:47:59,870 --> 01:48:01,997
<i>Baby,
you turn my head around</i>

1303
01:48:02,072 --> 01:48:05,735
<i>- Love, sweet love
- Love, sweet love</i>

1304
01:48:05,809 --> 01:48:09,768
<i>- Has a mind of its own
- Love's got a mind of its own</i>

1305
01:48:09,847 --> 01:48:11,815
<i>I can't control it, now</i>

1306
01:48:11,882 --> 01:48:15,147
<i>- Love, sweet love
- My love</i>

1307
01:48:15,219 --> 01:48:19,019
<i>Has a mind of its own</i>

1308
01:48:19,089 --> 01:48:21,523
<i>I can't believe
I found you, girl</i>

1309
01:48:21,592 --> 01:48:24,083
<i>Love, sweet love</i>
