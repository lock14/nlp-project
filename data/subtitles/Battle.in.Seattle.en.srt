1
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,000

2
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,300
1947: shortly after
the close of World War ll,

3
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,450
23 nations signed
a general agreement

4
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,050
on tariffs and trade,

5
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,300
the GATT.

6
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,300
Its purpose was to liberalize
and expand world trade.

7
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,550
Stability,
a sense of global community:

8
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,000
they were the key.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,200
For five decades,
the GATT will grow,

10
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,250
adding more members and becoming
the World Trade Organization.

11
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,200
We are writing the constitution
for a single global economy.

12
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,500
With over 150 member nations,

13
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,550
the WTO controls
90% of world trade.

14
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,500
Unlike the GATT, the WTO
can impose punishing fines

15
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,850
on member countries
that don't abide by its laws.

16
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,900
Along with this expansion
of free trade,

17
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,400
the WTO avows to help
developing countries

18
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,050
benefit fully from
the global trading system.

19
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,700
It has very little
to do with trade,

20
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,050
and it's certainly not free.

21
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,900
It's a system
of global governance

22
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,100
none of us voted for
and none of us control.

23
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,550
It simply means breaking down
the borders of countries.

24
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,800
So that large corporations

25
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,750
will be free to operate anywhere
without interference

26
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,150
by governments
or the people of these nations.

27
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,700
And what they are saying

28
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,300
is that money values
should rule over life values,

29
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,800
that human rights
and the environment

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,000
should be subordinated
to the needs of commerce.

31
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,600
The clean air rules were gutted.

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,200
Cases of asthma increased.

33
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,900
Genetically modified foods
forced onto European consumers.

34
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,050
Small-scale banana growers
crushed by large corporations.

35
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,950
Despite the problems
and criticism,

36
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,750
the WTO continues to grow,

37
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,650
making it more powerful
than ever.

38
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,300
On the upcoming meeting
in Seattle,

39
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,700
dubbed the Millennium Round,

40
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,150
new issues will be added
to the WTO's existing rules.

41
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,000
lmposing even tighter
corporate control

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,350
over more areas of our lives.

43
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,800
To many, this meeting
has become a battle

44
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,150
for the future.

45
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,100
<i></i>

46
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,000
All right, here,
you take this, man.

47
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,900
Jay, she's turtling.

48
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,850

49
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,200
Shit. Hold it.

50
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,500
Okay, you drop
the rope.

51
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,300
<i>AH right,
I'm coming to get you.</i>

52
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,500
It's all right.
I got you.

53
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,350
Not much of a last-minute
replacement, am I?

54
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:38,800
No, but you're better-looking
than he was.

55
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,850
Hey, don't get any ideas.

56
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,550
<i>Imus! have checked everything
three times.</i>

57
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,050
I never ended up
like this before.

58
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,200
<i>
That's Why you got to be</i>

59
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,350
a little crazy to take this gig.

60
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,100
All right,
you're good.

61
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,450
Okay, you wait for my signal
before we descend, all right?

62
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,750
I'm Lou, by the way.

63
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,800
Oh. Jay.

64
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,650

65
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,350
We better get going before
you're eating breakfast in jail.

66
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,300
I don't plan on getting arrested
until at least tomorrow.

67
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400

68
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,700
Fuck.

69
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,800
- Close one.
- Yeah, real smooth.

70
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,600
All right, let's do it.

71
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,100

72
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,900
Tomorrow,
the World Trade Organization

73
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,250
will meet in Seattle.

74
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,100
It will be the largest meeting
on global trade ever known...

75
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,050
Jimmy Hoffa
and the labor unions,

76
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,850
along with environmentalists
and human rights advocates,

77
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,050
put together a rally
at Memorial Stadium

78
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,700
with an estimated 30,000
to 40,000 people.

79
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,450
More than 50,000 protesters

80
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,950
may be in the streets
to demonstrate against the WTO.

81
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,500
It's been 30 years since
the Democratic convention riots

82
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,800
in 1968 pitted police and
protestors against each other.

83
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,250
But some fear history
will repeat itself

84
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,600
this week in Seattle

85
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,700
as the World Trade Organization
prepares to hold

86
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,400
<i>its first ever ministerial
meeting on U.S. soil.</i>

87
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,300
We have identified
the subjects

88
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,400
of our most recent
surveillance photos,

89
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,600
and they're not anarchists
as we originally thought.

90
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,200
All right, so we have
a great team of lawyers

91
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,000
that are pulling together
to help us out on this.

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,900
It's really important
that you call this number.

93
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,550
<i>
AH right Jay:!</i>

94
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,350
All right.

95
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,050

96
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,300
First one: Django Mills,

97
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,000
<i>arrested in four different
countries for property damage</i>

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,100
involving whaling ships
and shrimp trawlers.

99
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,000
<i>Louise Phillips:</i>

100
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,450
<i>burned down her father's
animal research lab,</i>

101
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,500
<i>although she wasn't
formally charged.</i>

102
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,150
She has been involved
in Black Bloc demonstrations

103
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,650
that have turned violent.

104
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,950
<i>Samantha Clayton."
no criminal record,</i>

105
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,850
appears to have studied law,

106
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,350
<i>and was involved in
the Sequoia Forest legal case</i>

107
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,600
back in '98.

108
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,350
And last but not least,
Jay Elgin.

109
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,600
We got 13 major intersections
downtown,

110
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,550
and each of the affinity groups
are gonna shut these areas down.

111
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,450
Now, how are we gonna do it?

112
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,800
<i>
Non violently.</i>

113
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,000
That's right,
and by consensus.

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Jay's brother was killed

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,900
in the Sequoia Forest
demonstration.

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,700
<i>
Hem!
Hem!</i>

117
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,050
My brother's been hit.

118
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,700
<i>My brother's been hit!
Get an ambulance!</i>

119
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,000
My brother's been hit.

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,200

121
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,550
<i>Don'! arrest me!
My brother's been hit!</i>

122
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,950
We need an ambulance!

123
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,100
Since then,
he's been involved

124
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,150
in every major demonstration
across the country,

125
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,900
including getting himself
arrested at the IMF in '98.

126
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,250
We need a show of hands
of those of you

127
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,050
that are prepared to go to jail
if need be.

128
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,400
<i>And don't feel bad
if you're not.</i>

129
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,450
<i>We need as many people
on the outside as We can get.</i>

130
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,500
All right, people,

131
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,450
well, opening ceremonies
begin in about 24 hours,

132
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,800
so please get ready

133
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,500
'cause we're gonna shut
these motherfuckers down!

134
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,400
All right?

135
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,100

136
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,100
We set up
two tripwire barricades

137
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,650
around the Paramount Theatre.

138
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,550
Now, we believe
that all the protesters

139
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,900
will be concentrated there.

140
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,300
Now, to get through that,

141
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,700
they're gonna
have to climb fences,

142
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,950
jump over Metro buses,

143
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,450
at which point
they'll be arrested.

144
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,650
Well, make sure we're only
arresting them there, okay?

145
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,050
I want to keep
this city's image clean.

146
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,700
How many protesters
are we expecting?

147
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,450
Several thousand.
Maybe 10,000.

148
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,750
Are we ready for this?

149
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,250
Quite sure of it.

150
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,750
The WTO opening ceremonies
are scheduled to take place

151
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,200
at the Paramount Theatre
downtown.

152
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,350
<i>
issues such as human rights,</i>

153
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,450
<i>labor standards,
and environmental protection</i>

154
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,400
<i>are not on the formal agenda
of the Seattle meeting,</i>

155
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,200
<i>but with more than 20,000
WTO critics planning to march,</i>

156
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,400
<i>I! looks as though...</i>

157
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,500
What?
That makes no sense to you?

158
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,300
I'm just looking
for a good story.

159
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,400

160
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,050
<i>
Nothing irregular.</i>

161
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,750
<i>Everything seems great.</i>

162
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,850
<i>Looks like you're going to be
having</i> a <i>very healthy baby</i>

163
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,450
four months from now.

164
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,950
- 
- Ah.

165
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,400
Have you chosen
any names yet?

166
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,450
No, not-not-
not really.

167
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,000
Yeah, well,
there's a few we like, right?

168
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,350
Yeah, she has a few she likes.

169
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,350

170
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,700
<i>! got to go, baby-</i>

171
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,200
Oh, no.
Don't go now.

172
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,150
I wish I didn't have to,
but I'm running late as it is.

173
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,100
I love you, baby.

174
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,100
Come on,
five more minutes.

175
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,700
This protest
is driving me crazy.

176
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,900
It hasn't even
started yet.

177
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,650
Oh, come on.

178
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,000
<i>I'll call you.</i>

179
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,350
Doc, will you look after
this woman?

180
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,800
'Cause she's made me very happy.

181
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,450
<i>
I sure will.</i>

182
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,100
I'll see you.

183
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,200

184
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,900
<i>
it's taken two years</i>

185
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,100
to bring the World Trade
Organization to Seattle,

186
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,500
and we did it.

187
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,400

188
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,400
<i>
Nathan, you've arrived,
safe and sound.</i>

189
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,650
<i>May I present Nathan Abasi,</i>

190
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,900
one of the toughest negotiators
in the Southern Hemisphere.

191
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,950
<i>
I bet Mr. Dural was telling you</i>

192
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,800
I will be cutting
agricultural resources.

193
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,300

194
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,650
Along the way, the Emerald City
has beaten out Detroit,

195
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:46,050
Denver, Dallas, San Diego,
and Honolulu.

196
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,650
Oh, have you met
Dr. Alex Mario?

197
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,200
<i>He's from Bosnia
but works in Africa</i>

198
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
<i>with Médecins Sans Frontiéres.</i>

199
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,250
Nice to meet you.

200
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,600
Nice to meet you too.

201
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,550
He's here to raise awareness
about cost of AIDS medications.

202
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,650
Oh.

203
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:57,600
Yeah.

204
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,800
<i>
Well, I hope</i>

205
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,750
you have more luck at
these talks than I usually do.

206
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,600
<i></i>

207
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,850
I welcome all of you

208
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,650
for what will be a productive
and successful week.

209
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,850
To success.

210
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,400
<i>
Thank you.
Thank you all.</i>

211
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,950

212
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,000

213
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,400
Well, I've just been
to the WTO cocktail party...

214
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400

215
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,950
Where the hors d'oeuvres
were much better

216
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,000
but the music not so good.

217
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,200

218
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,300
You may or may not know this,

219
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,950
but I was once a protestor too
during Vietnam,

220
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,950
so I'm happy to have

221
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,100
the demonstrator's voice
be heard.

222
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,000
In turn, I've been promised
by numerous organizations

223
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
that there will be no violence.

224
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,500
If we stick to this plan,

225
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,700
I believe we will achieve
all that is hoped for.

226
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,750
What I'm trying to say is,
be tough on your issues,

227
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,550
but be gentle on my town.

228
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,500
Thank you.
Thank you.

229
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,450

230
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,850
- 
- All right.

231
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,800
Six months' planning,
here we go.

232
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,050
What time is it?

233
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,500
Don't know.

234
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,600
That was nice
last night.

235
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,500
We should get going.

236
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,000
What?

237
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,450
Man, you are not much
of a morning person, are you?

238
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,000
<i>
You check the roster?</i>

239
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
<i>
you can call in sick today.</i>

240
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,000
Heads up.

241
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,000
<i>Chief said there might be
chemical or bio attacks today.</i>

242
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,500
<i>
My fucking chemicals
right here.</i>

243
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
Oh, yeah?

244
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,950
I think if there was gonna be
chemical warfare,

245
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,050
we'd have more than
a couple hundred guys out there.

246
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,700
How's Ella and the baby?

247
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,500
Ah, great.

248
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,000
Yeah, we went for
the ultrasound yesterday,

249
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,800
and you can see
the whole little body

250
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,950
and even down
to the little fingers.

251
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,050
And then you hear
the heartbeat...

252
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,100

253
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,400
Really fast,
like the little guy was saying,

254
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,050
"Hi, Daddy.
Hi, Daddy. Hi, Daddy.

255
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,400
Hi, Daddy. Hi, Daddy."

256
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,550
<i>
So how'd you get into this?</i>

257
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,000
- What are you, a cop?
- Yeah.

258
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,400
And if you don't answer
my questions,

259
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
I'm gonna handcuff you.

260
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,850
When I was an animal activist,

261
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,400
I used to think
the strong prey on the weak.

262
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,200
When I was an anarchist,
I thought we could all be equal.

263
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,750
- What about now?
- <i>I</i> don't know.

264
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,300
I'm just taking one long look
at the enemy.

265
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,800
What about you,
hotshot?

266
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,100
What's got your panties
all in a bunch?

267
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,300
My panties are in bunch
because I want to make sure

268
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,850
that everything runs smoothly
and nobody gets hurt.

269
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,700
Of course we're gonna get hurt.
What do you think this is?

270
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,650
Pretty tough, aren't you?

271
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:18,050
Protests get me excited
and depressed at the same time.

272
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,450
I don't know what that makes me.

273
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,000
Hey, we're gonna move
in 15 minutes, Dale.

274
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,400
We're not keeping you,
are we?

275
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
<i>
No, sir.</i>

276
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
- Good luck out there.
- Luck?

277
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,050
The only people
that's gonna need luck

278
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,400
is those fucking
tree huggers.

279
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,900
Give me your arm.

280
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,900
Your number?

281
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,500
It's a lawyer's number
for when you're in jail.

282
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,050
I thought you were gonna be
my knight in shining armor.

283
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:47,050
I think rescuing you
on the crane was enough.

284
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,350

285
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,400
<i>
All right, kids,</i>

286
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,150
enough small talk;
come on.

287
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,100
We got to get moving.

288
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,050

291
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,450
How'd it go yesterday?

292
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,600
Oh, my God,
you have to see this.

293
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,650
- Let me see.
- Look at that.

294
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,000
Oh, my God.

295
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,950
We are going shopping
for baby clothes immediately.

296
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,400
I don't even know
what it is yet.

297
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,750
Come on, you're
five months pregnant,

298
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,250
and you haven't bought
any baby clothes.

299
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,500
I'm just waiting,
you know?

300
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,550
So is it a boy or a girl?

301
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,450
I don't want to know.

302
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,650
Wow, is that
a police badge I see?

303
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,550
Ah, you're so funny.

304
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,800
Anyway, I hate to break up
this baby shower,

305
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,000
but I need someone at the other
register tout de suite.

306
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,800
What is it with him
and foreign languages?

307
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,000
Congratulations.

308
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,500
You look beautiful.

309
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,300
You are the people.

310
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,000
You are the power.

311
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,400
And we're gonna show it today
when we march.

312
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,700

313
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,650
When we live
under economic systems

314
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,650
that want to divide us
from each other,

315
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,700
but we will not today
be divided.

316
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,200
All right,
bring it in now.

359
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,900
WTO can help us.

360
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,700
I'm sorry, man, we're gonna
shut 'em down today.

361
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,350

362
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,250
<i>
We were given assurance
by we my</i>

363
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,300
<i>that this would not happen.</i>

364
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,050
Sir, I have some news.
It's not good.

365
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,750
Just tell me what the hell
is going on out there.

366
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,900
Look at this place.

367
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,900
Most of the delegates
can't get to the conference.

368
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,650
The protesters have seized
the intersections outside.

369
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,000
Weren't the police
preventing that?

370
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,900
Uh, no, sir.

371
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,050
Well, why not?

372
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,850
As you ordered,
there were to be no arrests made

373
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,450
outside of the barricades.

374
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:24,700
Look, the police have been
trying to secure safe passage

375
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,100
<i>for the delegates
and the ambassadors</i>

376
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,450
<i>but the protesters have
cemented their arms together.</i>

377
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,400
What?

378
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
They formed circles

379
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,150
so that the only way
you can separate them

380
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,750
is by breaking their arms.

381
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,100
Sir, the chief of police
is on line one.

382
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,150
Gordon, I thought you said

383
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,650
they wouldn't get past
the barricades.

384
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,700
<i>
We got</i> a <i>lot bigger problems
than that, Jim.</i>

385
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,450
<i>Right now, they've captured
the entire downtown core.</i>

386
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,150
There's so many
of them out there,

387
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,750
we couldn't arrest them all
even if we wanted to.

388
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,500
I thought they
were nonviolent.

389
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,900
<i>They're not being violent.</i>

390
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,000
All right,
what are we gonna do?

391
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
<i>I have called every patrol
in the state.</i>

392
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,400
<i>We even called
the fire department</i>

393
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,850
to hose down the protesters,
but they refused.

394
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,150
What are the options then?

395
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,550
There's only one option left.

396
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,950
Gordon...

397
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,250
lam not gonna start
gassing people, do you hear me?

398
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,400
I gave the protesters my word.

399
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,700
The press would have
a field day with me.

400
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,150
Uh, Jim, I think we're past
having that choice.

401
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,550
<i>
Sir, the White House
is on line two.</i>

402
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,600
All right,
I'll get it.

403
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,950
All right.

404
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,650
Just do whatever you have to do,

405
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,300
and just do it fast.

406
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,950
Nervous, Johnson?

407
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,850
Nervous?

408
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,600
What, are you fucking
kidding me, man?

409
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,850
I put on all this shit;

410
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,650
It's like I'm fucking
invincible, bitch.

411
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,950
Yeah, I used to feel that way
when I was a toddler.

412
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,300
We got some new orders,
so listen up.

413
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,350
<i>We're going to
the Paramount Theatre,</i>

414
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,450
and orders are to use
disbursement techniques.

415
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,100
<i>No arrests are to be made.
Understood?</i>

416
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,350
Wait, wait.

417
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,300
So you're saying if a protester
is breaking the law,

418
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,750
I'm supposed to, what,
just stand there and watch 'em?

419
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,800
That's right, Johnson.
That's coming from the top.

420
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,000
<i>We're gonna be there in five,
so refs be ready.</i>

421
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,950
Can you tell me the reason
why you're here today?

422
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,750
Well, basically,
the Endangered Species Act

423
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,000
requires that
shrimp trawlers

424
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,500
place special devices
on their boats

425
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,950
to prevent the killing
of sea turtles.

426
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,600
Now, the WTO,
they come along, and they say,

427
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,500
"Well, these devices
are somehow illegal..."

428
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,700
Well, we all love turtles,
but don't you think

429
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,400
there are more important
problems in the world

430
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
that need to be addressed?

431
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,750
If you feel that a ruling that
threatens an endangered species

432
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,400
is any different from, say,

433
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,550
millions of working-class jobs
being outsourced

434
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,550
or the quality
of our environment

435
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,650
or our food getting worse,

436
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,300
you’re just not
connecting the dots.

437
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,650

438
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,700

439
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,950
Do you think a few signs
and some catchy slogans

440
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,150
are going to somehow
stop global trade?

441
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,800
Well, see, we have no problem
with so-called free trade

442
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,000
<i>as long as it's no!
at the expense</i>

443
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
of our human values.

444
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,750
Yes?

445
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,200
Because of the WTO's
legally binding laws...

446
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,600
Thank you so much.
That was great.

447
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,200
Michael, let's roll.
Pine and Fifth.

448
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,500
Good luck, man.

449
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,250

450
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,550
Put your head back.
Put your head back.

451
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,800
It hurts, man.
It burns.

452
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,650
Put your head back.
Come on, come on.

453
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,400
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes.

454
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,950
Come on.
Tilt your head back.

455
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,400
Okay, everyone,
this is what I've heard.

456
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,900
There are protesters
at the end of Sixth Avenue,

457
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,950
so you'll be let out

458
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,800
right in the middle
of the protest, okay?

459
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,800
Now, I've called and asked
for immediate updates.

460
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,950
They said, "Just relax.
Have lunch."

461
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,550
<i>

What?

478
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,500
Sir, Hoffa Jr.'s agreed.

479
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,400
Ah.

00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,700

Governor?

483
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,550
Yeah, I've got some good news.

484
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,050
The White House is giving Labor
a seat at the negotiating table.

485
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,050
They won't be joining
the protest downtown.

486
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,400
<i>
Well, that's</i> a <i>bonus,
but we have other problems.</i>

487
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,050
I have the Secret Service
all over me,

488
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,750
<i>and they're saying action
must be taken immediately.</i>

489
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,200
<i>Look, I'm under
extreme pressure here</i>

490
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,700
to call in the Guard now.

491
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,350
The protesters are nonviolent.

492
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,600
You bring in the National Guard,

493
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,350
the whole community's
gonna become alarmed.

494
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:32,550
<i>Jim, I have the Secretary
of State confined to</i> a <i>hotel...</i>

495
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,350
<i>I have the While House
pressuring me</i>

496
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,350
to call a state of emergency.

497
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,400
I understand that,

498
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,000
but right now,
we simply cannot do that.

499
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
They'll clash with
the entire Labor march.

500
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,100
<i>And that?! make
our problems now</i>

501
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,400
seem like a walk in the park.

502
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,600
We cannot call in
the National Guard now.

503
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,850
Are you prepared to handle this?

504
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,700
Because we have a potential
catastrophe on our hands.

505
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,250
Just-John, John,
listen, please, okay?

506
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,050
Just give the police some time.
They'll be effective.

507
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,300
Just give me a few more hours.

508
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,200
Okay, I'm giving you two hours,
and that's it.

509
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,100

510
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,700
- Sir?
- What?

511
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,600
The WTO ceremonies have
just been cancelled, so...

512
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,900
Okay.

513
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,300
Oh, my God.

514
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,300
Yes! It worked!

515
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,500
It worked!

516
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,600
<i>There were so many people.</i>

517
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,500
<i>Where did all these people
come from?</i>

518
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,700
<i>It was like</i> a <i>Thriller video.</i>

519
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,100
I mean, they were coming
out the garbage can,

520
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,300
out of the ground.

521
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,350
Welcome to the first
internet protest in history.

522
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,300
Think Labor's ready
to join this party'?

523
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,300
Come on, Labor.

524
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:42,800

525
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,700
Hey, give me that.

526
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,300
<i>Don'! go that way.</i>

527
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,850
<i>We need you downtown.</i>

528
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,050
That's what we were told to do,
and that's what we're doing.

529
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,600
The man who's chopping down
the redwoods

530
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,600
is the same guy who's destroying
your workers' rights.

531
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,900
We're fighting
for the same thing.

532
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,700

533
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,450
Teamsters and turtles together.

534
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,400
We need you.

535
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,450
Teamsters and turtles together.

536
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,300
Teamsters and turtles together.

537
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,100
Teamsters and turtles together.

538
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,400
Gordon, what's going on?

539
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,000
Are we making any progress
out there?

540
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,800
We just got reports back
our boys are seeing

541
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,300
Labor marches
all over downtown.

542
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,750
Away from the designated
march route?

543
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,100
Well, how the hell
did that happen?

544
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,200
We don't know yet.

545
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,850
What do you mean
you don't know?

546
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,500
Labor promised to march back
to Memorial Stadium.

547
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,650
I know.

548
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:36,200
Just find out
what's going on, will ya?

549
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,400
<i>
The demonstration
caused the cancellation</i>

550
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,000

opening ceremonies,</i>

551
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,300

552
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,200

553
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,300
Fuck!

554
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,700
<i>
Got under way almost on time.</i>

555
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,200
The TV crew's pulled out.

556
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,550
They said they were
covering the protests.

557
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,700

558
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,400
Aw, you should
just get pregnant.

559
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,400
Come on, we always said
we'd do it together.

560
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,400
Then I better find
a good sperm bank.

561
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,650
Well, you better hurry up.
I'm five months ahead of you.

562
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:17,000
I do have something
a little different in mind.

563
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,700
- Lambada, anyone?
- No.

564
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,350
Oh, yeah,
the forbidden dance?

565
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,150
Dale and I were gonna
go to Brazil.

566
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,500
You never told me that.

567
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
Yeah; three days
after his dad died,

568
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,550
he came back from some park
he had been to and said,

569
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,500
"Let's just quit our jobs.
Let's go traveling."

570
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,200
He even started
buying guidebooks.

571
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,150
Two weeks later,
I found out I was pregnant,

572
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:37,150
Dale got promoted,

573
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:40,200
and we just never
talked about it again.

574
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,750
I just wish that it was
better timing, you know'?

575
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,950
There's never a good time;
you just do it,

576
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:45,900
<i>and it's right.</i>

577
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,100
I just-l feel like my life

578
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,600
is being shuffled
into this next phase,

579
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,000
and I-l don't feel
quite ready for it.

580
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,700
I mean, I don't want the cover
of some brochure magazine

581
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,200
to be the closest thing
we ever get to adventure.

582
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,350
You want adventure?

583
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,950
You just signed up for
the biggest adventure of all.

584
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,700
<i>It's gonna be great.</i>

585
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,400
You?! see.

586
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,900
Maybe I will go visit
a sperm bank.

587
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,650
But if you're going there,
you don't have to.

588
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,800
Ooh, that would be better,
wouldn't it?

589
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,500

590
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,450
What are you doing?
This woman is pregnant.

591
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,500
Oh, yeah?
You're gonna have a kid?

592
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,850
Yeah.

593
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,300
<i>Would you wan! your kid
to Work to death in a sweatshop</i>

594
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,600
making baby clothes?

595
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,800
Of course not.

596
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,300
Then don't fucking shop here!

597
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,300
What the hell's going on
out there?

598
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,300
<i>
What the fuck?</i>

599
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,650
I know we asked you
not to do this shit today.

600
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,600
I didn't promise you
anything.

601
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,150
I didn't get in your way,
so you stay out of mine.

602
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,500
Our message is just
as valid as yours.

603
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,500
Take the fucking mask off
and join the rest of us.

604
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,800
<i>
Are you fucking kidding me?</i>

605
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,100
Are you a fucking moron, man?

606
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,250
You're ruining everything
we've worked for.

607
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,300
Now, we stopped them today.

608
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,350
And what about tomorrow?

609
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,300
And frankly,
I don't give a fuck

610
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,750
what it is
you accomplished today.

611
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,200
I'm not just gonna lay down
and say, "Peace and love,"

612
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,300
and, "Can I stick a flower

613
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,600
in the barrel of
your machine gun, piggy?"

614
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,150
The streets of Seattle
have descended into chaos

615
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,450
as violent demonstrators
are smashing shop windows.

616
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,800
You understand me?

617
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,200
What the hell
are we waiting on?

618
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,650
This is
a nonviolent protest.

619
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,450
And that's not violent!

620
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,600
<i>Do you see anybody
getting hurt?</i>

621
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,750
We attack
corporate America.

622
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,500
That's not the point!

623
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,300
The media's
feasting on this.

624
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,150
Exactly. We are the ones
making this day famous.

625
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,650
Are you blind?
You're feeding them.

626
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,850
You're giving them
exactly what they want.

627
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,400
You call that anarchy?

628
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,300
You're just pissed 'cause you're
not getting enough attention,

629
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,300
sweetheart.

630
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,500
- Ah!
- No!

631
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,450
Nonviolence, huh?

632
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,550
Fuck you!

633
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,200
- Stop!

634
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,150
<i>
Get off of me!</i>

635
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,550
- Stop, Lou.
- What do you know, huh?

636
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,600
You're just trying
to run this show

637
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,750
without even getting
your hands dirty.

638
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,850
Look, you know
nothing about me.

639
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,300
I've been around men like you
my whole life.

640
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:53,050
You're a fucking coward, Jay.

641
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,200
Lou.

642
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,300
- Fuck off.
- Lou!

643
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,700
Excuse me.

644
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,600
Why do you believe violence
is the best way

645
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,400
to get your message across?

646
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,350
Oh, you want to know my message?

647
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,700
I want to you to stop spreading

648
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,350
corporate-controlled
disinformation around the globe

649
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,650
and start covering
the real issues,

650
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:11,900
like why this fucking world

651
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,700
is being raped by guys
that make $500 million a year

652
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,400
while the rest
of the world starves.

653
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,200
Why don't you put that
on the 9:00 news?

654
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,350
And we're cut.

655
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:25,150
Do you want me
to keep the tape?

656
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,800
What do you think?

657
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,900
They breaking shit,
and we're running
from civilians.

658
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,350
Supp
y's almost out of teargas;
we need to regroup.

659
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,500
Regroup or not, this is
a bad message to send, man.

660
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,500
<i>We look fucking useless.</i>

661
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,100
If you want to be useful,
Johnson,

662
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,500
you can be the one
to resupply the gas.

663
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,400
Now, we got a van
heading upstate to restock.

664
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,000
Don't smile at me, boy.

665
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,900
Now, go get changed
and bring your civilian clothes.

666
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,250
I don't want to hear
any more lip.

667
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,000
We got to move and move fast;
we got a problem a block down.

668
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,800
Let's go! Come on.

669
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,650

670
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:02,500
<i>I</i> Where those treetops glisten <i>I</i>

671
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,400
<i>I</i> And children listen <i>I</i>

672
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,850

<i>I The snow I</i>

674
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:21,500
<i>I</i> Then l, l, I am dreaming

675
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,600
<i>I</i> With every Christmas card

676
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,850

677
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,750

680
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,200

681
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,350
<i>
You asked for</i> a <i>few hours,
and I gave it to you.</i>

682
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,900
And they've remained nonviolent.

683
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,250
Nonviolent does not mean
law-abiding.

684
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,650
<i>If we had called
in the National Guard</i>

685
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,900
<i>when I requested,
Seattle wouldn't be</i>

686
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,600
in every goddamn newspaper
around the globe.

687
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,150
We got taken by surprise, Jim.

688
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,000
Now it's time
to take control back.

689
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,900
The National Guard
won't be here until tomorrow.

690
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,950
And that is why calling
a state of emergency

691
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:06,450
and imposing a curfew
is our only option.

692
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,550
Are you out of your mind?

693
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,500
You're gonna turn downtown
into a war zone.

694
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,000
Have you been outside lately?
It looks like Beirut!

695
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,750

696
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:23,150
In 12 hours, the president
of the United States

697
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,050
is gonna be landing here.

698
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,450
He has already called
and threatened to cancel,

699
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,900
and that is not gonna happen.

700
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,500
<i>Do you understand?</i>

701
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:39,200
His arrival will signal
a return to normalcy, right?

702
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,700
Are we agreed?

703
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,000

704
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,200

705
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,600
And then the window just—

706
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,000
it just-
it just smashed behind us.

707
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,900

<i>
Why wasn't the National Guard
called in earlier?</i>

00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,000
We believed that a show of force

780

the circumstances worse.

00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,450
It's a long story.

894
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:24,300
Ah, what the fuck
is this shit.

895
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,250
Careful. We've been using
that as a porta potty.

896
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,250
There's some bottles
you don't want to knock over.

897
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,700
Ah, these bottles,
that's great.

898
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,050
And bullshit.

899
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:36,150
We haven't had a break or food
since we woke up.

900
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:38,400
I'm sick of this.

901
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,950
Oh, incoming.

902
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:41,850
<i>
What?</i>

903
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:43,500
They've been looking for you.

904
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,800
Dale.

905
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,900
Yeah?

906
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,400
<i>Your wife's in the hospital.</i>

907
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,700
Let's go ahead and prep
trauma one and two.

908
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,250
<i>
The group just continued
destroying property,</i>

909
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,550
<i>vandalizing cars,
creating havoc.</i>

910
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,500
<i>The police were nowhere
to be found.</i>

911
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,250
<i>About an hour after that,
the group was back in action...</i>

912
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,950
<i>But for us to have
to close our stores</i>

913
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,400
<i>during the peak season,</i>

914
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,200
<i>the holiday Christmas season
just beginning,</i>

915
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,500
<i>really is an injustice.</i>

916
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,000
<i>
They're breaking the bank's
windows here at U.S. Bank.</i>

917
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,500
<i>We go! to get out of here...</i>

918
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,100
<i>
A group we now know
as Anarchist...</i>

919
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,000
<i></i>

920
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,800
<i>
The battle in Seattle
turns into</i> a <i>war.</i>

921
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,200
Jesus Christ.

922
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,650

923
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:42,800
Battle in Seattle?

924
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,100
It sounds like
a monster truck show.

925
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,650
They turned us into
icons of violence.

926
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:50,600
Well,
what do you expect?

927
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,750
What did I expect?

928
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:54,900
I mean, eight corporations
own half the U.S. media.

929
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,000
You know that.

930
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,700
Then what the fuck
are we doing this for?

931
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,500
I'm sorry.

932
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,750
Jay, please.

933
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,950
If you want to leave again,
then just leave.

934
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:29,550
That's not fair.

935
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:32,000
This is hard for me.

936
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,500
We shut them down,
and look what they did to us.

937
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,800
<i>We failed, Jay.</i>

938
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,100
You only fail when you quit.

939
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,200
Oh, fuck you.

940
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,650
I wanted justice
for your brother

941
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:41,600
as much as you did,

942
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,100
but we never
would have won that case.

943
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,700
Oh, how would you know?
You gave up on it.

944
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,150
I gave up because I knew
we didn't stand a chance.

945
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:48,700
Oh, like now.

946
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,100
Yeah.

947
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,350
Okay, you're right.

948
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:01,000
Okay, maybe we wouldn't
have won back then,

949
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,150
but we still have
a chance now,

950
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:05,000
okay?

951
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,850
And I understand;
if you don't to protest,

952
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:08,900
you don't want to be part
of the legal team, that's fine,

953
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,500
but maybe you
could be a medic.

954
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,950
Look, I-

955
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:16,100
I know you want
to make a difference.

956
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,300
Yeah, I do.

957
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,000
But how do you stop those
who will stop at nothing?

958
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,400
You don't stop.

959
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,700
Who brought my wife in?

960
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,600
She's right
over there, sir.

961
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,550
Excuse me. You came in
with my wife, Ella.

962
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:53,300
- Yes.
- What happened?

963
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,200
She was attacked
by police.

964
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,400
Thank you.

965
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,500
<i>Ella.</i>

966
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,600
<i>Hi.</i>

967
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,900
How are you?

968
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,700
What happened?

969
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,000

970
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,900
<i>What?</i>

971
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,700

972
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,400
<i>Shh, shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.</i>

973
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,350
- It's okay.
- Baby.

974
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:58,600
It's okay.

975
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,150

976
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:02,350
It's okay.

977
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:03,300

978
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,350
It's okay now.

979
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,250
Get off me.

980
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:11,450
It's me, baby.
It's me.

981
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,050
Get off of me.

982
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:15,200

983
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,300
<i></i>

984
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,800
<i>Baby?</i>

985
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,900
Dale, don't.

986
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,400

987
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,450
Yesterday,
the protest spotlight

988
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:53,000
was supposed to have been
on Labor

989
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,800
and its critique of the WTO,

990
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,800
but by the time the Labor march
was ending,

991
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,450
the confrontations on the street
were heating up,

992
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:01,950
and Labor's message
was all but drowned out.

993
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:04,050
Last night, in an effort
to finally clear the streets...

994
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:05,550
Why more arrests
weren't made.

995
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:07,750
Many protesters had trained
in civil disobedience,

996
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:10,400
expecting, some even hoping,
they would be arrested.

997
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,750
Seattle police chief
said last night

998
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:14,000
that he had never been
more proud of his officers,

999
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,700
and he defended their actions.

1000
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,800
Our police officers,
in my judgment,

1001
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,150
did an extraordinary job today
against all odds.

1002
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:22,200

1003
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,550
All right, something tells me

1004
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:25,950
they're not gonna be as friendly
as they were yesterday.

1005
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:27,400

1006
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,900
You look like
you're going somewhere.

1007
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:35,300
So do you.

1008
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,200
<i>
Jay.</i>

1009
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,200
Yo.

1010
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:40,700
This'll get you in.

1011
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,350
Knock 'em dead, champ.
Come on.

1012
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:44,000
- All right.
- Bad tie.

1013
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,550
<i>
I'll give it to you
when I get back.</i>

1014
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:46,500
Good luck.

1015
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,600
I need more tear gas.

1016
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,000
Yesterday, we ran out
in four hours.

1017
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,750
I don't care what
they say downtown, all right?

1018
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:55,700
Lieutenant,
do you have a moment?

1019
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,750
Yeah.
Yeah, sure, Dale.

1020
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:01,300
Ah, sir, I need to request
permission to go home.

1021
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:05,100
L-I need to be
with my wife today.

1022
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,550
Yeah, Dale, look, I heard about
what happened with your wife.

1023
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:08,700
I'm sorry.

1024
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,400
I know this is
a bad time for you,

1025
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,700
but I need you
out on the street.

1026
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,500
Sir, I am not right
to go out there today.

1027
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:20,050
No, no, every man
is important out there.

1028
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,200
Look, when this thing's over,

1029
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:24,650
I'll give you off
all the time you want.

1030
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:25,500
Okay?

1031
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,000

1032
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,650
Patients are dying

1033
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:39,900
not because their diseases
are incurable,

1034
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,750
but because, as consumers,

1035
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:44,850
they do not provide
a viable market

1036
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:46,550
for pharmaceutical products.

1037
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:50,000
<i>I believe the WTO</i>

1038
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,450
must review its TRIPS agreements

1039
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:58,100
so that public health comes
before commercial interests.

1040
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:02,500
It is vital to the survival
of millions of people.

1041
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,800
Thank you.

1042
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,700

1043
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,300
<i>
I'm sure we all agree</i>

1044
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,850
that Doctors Without Borders
have done many great things.

1045
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:15,050
<i>However,
on the issue of patents,</i>

1046
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:17,050
<i>we believe they're</i>
a <i>little misguided.</i>

1047
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:18,450
Who's that?

1048
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,450
It's Mark Harrington.

1049
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:22,750
He's a major lobbyist
for the pharmaceutical industry.

1050
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:26,900
Many of these nations are
embroiled in bloody civil wars.

1051
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,250
Let's go.

1052
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:29,300
They lack the basic
infrastructures,

1053
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,750
such as clean water
and sewage treatment.

1054
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:34,550
Now, it is these that lead
inevitably to a health crisis

1055
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:37,350
<i>no matter how much medicine
is made available to them.</i>

1056
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:40,700
Doctor, your industry
as well as ours is dedicated

1057
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,550
<i>to maintaining
and preserving health.</i>

1058
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:46,750
Thank you.

1059
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:49,700

1060
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,100
Uh, excuse-

1061
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,900
Um, excu—

1062
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:54,900
Excuse me.

1063
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,600
I just wanted
to congratulate the WTO

1064
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:03,850
and particularly congratulate
Mr. Lovitz there.

1065
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:06,700
It's because of Mr. Lovitz
and the WTO's effort

1066
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,850
at eliminating trade tariffs
on lumber products

1067
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:11,850
<i>that two million acres
of forest</i>

1068
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:13,100
are being destroyed
and cut down,

1069
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,550
<i>and on top of that,</i>

1070
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:17,150
irreplaceable trees

Next time
we save some turtles,

1104
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:49,200
you should come along
with us.

1105
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,650
- I think I'd like that.
-Yeah.

1106
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:52,650
Why turtles?

1107
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:54,100
When I was a little kid,

1108
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,150
my grandfather,
he told me this cool story

1109
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,250
about how all the animals,

1110
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:59,100
you know, they made fun
of this one little turtle

1111
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,350
because he was different.

1112
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:02,250
You know,
he couldn't defend hisself,

1113
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:03,900
so of course,
they picked on him.

1114
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,000
But being he was a turtle,
he was smart.

1115
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,400
So he developed
this hard shell,

1116
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,000
and that only made
the animals mad,

1117
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,250
so they picked him up,
threw him in the river,

1118
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:16,150
and then he broke his shell
into, like, a dozen pieces.

1119
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:17,900
Poor turtle.

1120
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:20,000
<i>Yeah, they go! him good,
but he was tough.</i>

1121
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,350
<i>You know,
he picked hisself back up;</i>

1122
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:23,000
put himself back together.

1123
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,400
And even though, you know,
this time his shell was cracked,

1124
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,950
it was stronger than ever,
and that's why turtles

1125
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:31,650
have such beautiful patterns
on their shells.

1126
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:33,850
And then what happened?

1127
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:40,550
Well, because of the WTO,
they made him into an ashtray.

1128
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:43,050
That's fucked up, Django.

1129
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:45,500
Yeah.
Fucked-up world.

1130
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,700
Wait, so let me
get this straight.

to arrest anybody

we need all available
interpreters.

1245
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:14,400
An unscheduled meeting
takes precedence over us?

1246
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,000
<i>As host, we do reserve
the right to determine</i>

1247
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,700
how our resources
are allocated.

1248
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:20,500
<i>We can arrange
for interpreters to be here</i>

1249
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,900
<i>some other time.</i>

1250
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:30,250
And I will accept lots
of criticisms about the WTO

1251
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:32,150
and how we can improve
what we do.

1252
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:34,900
But one criticism
I will not accept,

1253
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:39,700
and that is that this house
in some way is not democratic.

1254
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,600
There are ministers from
all over the world assembled.

1255
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,850
There are ministers who are
appointed by their presidents

1256
01:01:45,850 --> 01:01:48,100
or elected
by their parlI aments.

1257
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:52,000

1258
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,200

1259
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,400

1260
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:59,700

1261
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,750

1262
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:05,300
90% of all death and suffering
from infectious disease

1263
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,000
occurs in the Third World.

1264
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,850
I'm sorry, I have to-

1265
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:13,600
14 million people die
every year.

1266
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,500
So many could be saved
if medicines were cheaper,

1267
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,550
<i>bu! they are simply
too expensive</i>

1268
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:22,300
for developing nations
to afford

1269
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:25,050
due to patent protection laws.

1270
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:26,950

1271
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:28,550
Stop. Please stop.

1272
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:30,800
Don't you have children?

1273
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:37,500
How would you feel
if your child was sick,

1274
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:41,900
you knew there was a cure,
but you couldn't afford it,

1275
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:47,000
so you must stand by
and watch your child die?

1276
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,900
You people, right here...

1277
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:56,750
You have a power
to make a difference.

1278
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:58,550
<i>Isn't I! time</i>

1279
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:03,750
that people mattered
more than profit?

1280
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:06,700

1281
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:18,500

1282
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,300
<i>I</i> Here's a little song
I wrote <i>I</i>

1283
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,900
<i>I</i> Everybody,
sing it note for note <i>I</i>

1284
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,950

01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,300
<i>I Dooo-doo-doo-do-do I</i>

1288

1289
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:41,350
Come on, y'all.

1290
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:42,800
I mean, this ain't
the end of the world.

1291
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,200
We're just getting
locked up.

1292
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,450
Well, at least, it ain't
the end of the world yet.

1293
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:49,550
You're being
way too quiet on me.

1294
01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:53,150
Something happened
with you and Jay, right?

1295
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:54,150
What do you mean?

1296
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:56,100
Oh, you know,
Django know.

1297
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,650
You know,
I see everything.

1298
01:03:58,650 --> 01:04:00,550
I saw that little look
he gave you.

1299
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:01,450
What look?

1300
01:04:01,450 --> 01:04:02,800
"What look."

1301
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,050
You know, that look.

1302
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:05,950
I mean, I ain't seen him
give that look in a long time.

1303
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:07,400
I didn't see no look.

1304
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,150
<i>Okay, well, okay,
!ain't seen no wok either.</i>

1305
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:10,200
<i>You know, maybe it was just,</i>

1306
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,150
you know, the tear gas
and all that type of stuff

1307
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:13,700
messing my eyes UP-

1308
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:16,200
Then he almost gets arrested
trying to save you and Sam,

1309
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,600
and that ain't cool;
he cannot get locked up.

1310
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:19,850
God forbid.

1311
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:21,300
Hell, yeah.

1312
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:25,250
I mean, I like making fun of him
too much to see him gone.

1313
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:27,100
What do you mean, "gone"?

1314
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:29,300
<i>They go! two strikes
against him.</i>

1315
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:32,950
<i>He get one more,
he is out of here.</i>

1316
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:36,150
<i>I mean, for life;
no joke.</i>

1317
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:37,550
Didn't he tell you?

1318
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:38,850
No, he didn't.

1319
01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:40,100
Ah, yeah.

1320
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:45,950
I mean, '98, IMF;
'97, the whole forest thing.

1321
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:49,500
The boy got some nuts
on him, though,

1322
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,050
even if they are organic nuts.

1323
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:53,200

1324
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,100
They some nuts.

1325
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,650

1326
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:58,450
Come on, y'all.

1327
01:04:58,450 --> 01:04:59,900
Tough crowd.

1328
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,250
Forced from downtown by police
as curfew descends,

1329
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:07,600
an angry crowd of demonstrators
mixed with residents

1330
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,000
are near Broadway
and Pine Street.

1331
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,550
Go home to your wife,
to your kids.

1332
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:14,950
Police patience
finally runs out.

1333
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:16,200

1334
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:20,600
The battle
for Capitol Hill begins.

1335
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:26,550
Police retake Capitol Hill,
but some say amid the tear gas

1336
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:28,850
<i>and rubber bullets,
they have lost credibility.</i>

1337
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:32,150
<i>For many, the violent climax
of the battle for Capitol Hill</i>

1338
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:33,800
<i>is the last straw.</i>

1339
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,000
Be ready for
a long vacation.

1340
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,600
<i>
This is not</i> a <i>police state!</i>

1341
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:44,250
<i>
The last group was pushed past
the Paramount Theatre,</i>

1342
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:47,500
<i>up Pine Street,
all the way to Capitol Hill.</i>

1343
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,400

1344
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,450
- Fuck, man.
- What the hell?

1345
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:52,000
Son of a bitch.

1346
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,200
Shit, man.

1347
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:57,650
They put piss in it.

1348
01:05:57,650 --> 01:05:58,550
Go home!

1349
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:00,650
They put fucking-

1350
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:02,400
Get up there,
all right?

1351
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,700
You can shower later.
Get up there now.

1352
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,300
Son of a bitch!

1353
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,400
<i>
Stand back.</i>

01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:19,600
Where the fuck
is everybody?

1355
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,300
Haven't you done enough?

1356
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:25,400
<i>You're the ones
making this violent.</i>

1357
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,400
<i>This was a peaceful protest.</i>

1358
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:31,000
Yeah, come on!

1359
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:31,900
Stand back!

1360
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,800
Why are you so proud
of yourself?

1361
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,800
Come on,
you fucking cowards.

1362
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,900
<i>Oh, you think you're so brave</i>

1363
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:42,650
<i>now that there's only
six of you?</i>

1364
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:43,900

1365
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:46,000
Dale, what you doing, man?
We got to wait for backup.

1366
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,300
I'm doing my job.

1367
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:49,100
Come on. He's just a kid.

1368
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,750
<i>Would you shoot your own kid?</i>

1369
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:52,300
<i>Huh?</i>

1370
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,200
Would you should your own kid

1371
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:57,900
<i>Huh?</i>

1372
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:58,800
Take this.

01:06:58,900 --> 01:06:59,900
What?

01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:03,700

Look at me. Look at me.

1393
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:32,600
Oh, fuck.
Just lay there for a second.

Where's everybody going?

1411
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:30,000
There are hundreds of us
in jail.

1412
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,200
What about them?

1413
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,500
This isn't over yet.

1414
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:35,700
You can't just leave them there.

We can't leave them there
to rot.

1416
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,200
And what are we supposed to do?

1417
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:49,050
Look, I'm gonna have to get
a fucking hamburger.

1418
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:51,050
Every one of our lawyers
are in here?

1419
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:52,400
That's what I heard.

1420
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,600
Who's gonna get us out?

1421
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,450
Anybody hear anything
about Jay?

1422
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:01,000
Nobody's seen
or heard from him.

1423
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,950
<i>Until they let us talk
with somebody on the outside,</i>

1424
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:05,850
we have no idea
what we're dealing with.

1425
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:07,100

1426
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,700
<i>
All jewelry, your wallet.</i>

1427
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,900
I'm gonna need the cigarettes
and the phone too.

1428
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,750
All personal belongings
must be handed in.

1429
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:16,800
Let's go.

1430
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:17,700
<i>
Take it easy man. !'m-</i>

1431
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,200
<i>
Shut up!</i>

1432
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,200
Step to your right.

1433
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,600
<i>
What the fuck you looking at?</i>

1434
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,700

1435
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:34,950
Excuse me,
can I make a phone call?

1436
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:35,950
No. Sit down.

1437
01:11:35,950 --> 01:11:37,300
Look, I have the number
right here.

1438
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:38,850
Do you understand
what "no" means?

1439
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:40,300
One call.

1440
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,700
When you decide
to give us your name,

1441
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:43,000
then we'll give you
your rights.

1442
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,100
Jay?

1443
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,150
<i>Jay?</i>

1444
01:11:50,150 --> 01:11:51,300
Jay!

1445
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:53,200
<i>What the fuck
have you done to him?</i>

1446
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,850
You fricking pigs!

1447
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:59,400
<i>Is that what happens when you
exercise your civil liberties .7</i>

1448
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:00,400
<i>
Miss Clayton .7</i>

1449
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,450
<i>The mayor will see you now.</i>

1450
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:04,300

1451
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:06,900
Have a seat.

1452
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:09,250
<i>It's a big responsibility
you have,</i>

1453
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:11,950
handling, what is it,
600 people?

1454
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:14,000
600 innocent people,
Mr. Mayor.

1455
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:18,100
I'll be the first to admit
that mistakes were made,

1456
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:21,450
but those protesters are in jail
because they broke the law.

1457
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:23,250
You and I both know
you're incarcerating people

1458
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:24,500
who will never stand trial.

1459
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:33,100
This is a file of
many of the known protesters

1460
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:34,400
who are in jail.

1461
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,000
<i>If they agree
that for two years</i>

1462
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,100
<i>they won'! demonstrate,</i>

1463
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:43,650
they'll be released immediately.

1464
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:46,000
They'll never agree
to having their civil liberties

1465
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,800
<i>taken away any more
than they already have been.</i>

1466
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,350
Neither will I, Mr. Mayor.

1467
01:12:50,350 --> 01:12:52,200
Well, I think you should
give them the choice, don't you,

1468
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,350
considering the consequences?

1469
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:54,600
Which are exactly?

1470
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:55,650
<i>Your clients</i>

1471
01:12:55,650 --> 01:12:56,800
are in a precarious situation,

1472
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,000
especially those
with criminal records.

1473
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:07,500
First of all,
court rules have been violated

1474
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:10,250
by not providing prisoners
with access to counsel.

1475
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:12,200
Second, access to counsel
is not contingent

1476
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,600
on answering police questions,
including, "What is your name?"

1477
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,350
<i>And lastly,</i>

1478
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:17,400
you don't have the resources

1479
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:19,000
to provide a jury
and a public defender

1480
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,100
to everyone in that jail,

1481
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:21,750
so let's not bother
bluffing anymore.

1482
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:23,950
<i>I want my clients freed
with no fines,</i>

1483
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:25,200
<i>no restitution orders,</i>

1484
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,750
and no criminal charges.

1485
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:29,250
It's hard to help your clients
if they won't talk.

1486
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:31,000
Well, their voices must
have been taken away

1487
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
when their rights were.

1488
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:33,950
Okay.

1489
01:13:33,950 --> 01:13:35,150
I want to see the prisoners now.

1490
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:36,900
Well, I suggest you come back
in a couple of days

1491
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,050
when it's quieter.

1492
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:39,000
Thank you.

1493
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,300
Let them go!

1494
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:59,000
Doesn't look like
it's gonna get much quieter...

1495
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:04,250
Especially for you, Mr. Mayor.

1496
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:06,250
Thank you.

1497
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:08,200

<i>Ella?</i>

1500
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:20,800
Just tell him I'll be back
in a couple of days.

1501
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000

1506
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,500
Jay, are you okay?

1507
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:56,750
<i>

I'm so sorry.

It's okay.

1512
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:12,400
I didn't know.

1513
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:16,800

<i>H's okay.
Hey, hey.</i>

1516
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,100
I didn't know
you had it in you too.

1517
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:28,000
<i>What?</i>

1518
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,650
That voice.

1519
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:31,200
<i>The one that tells you</i>

1520
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:34,100

1600

1601
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:16,200

01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:17,300

<i>
Sir.</i>

1604
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:20,800
The Labor Council
is threatening a general strike

1605
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,550
if the jailed protesters
aren't released.

1606
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:23,800
General strike?

1607
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:26,300
Yes, sir.

1608
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,100
<i>
The protesters are demanding</i>

1609
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:32,500
<i>the release of 500 or so
protesters behind bars.</i>

1610
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:36,850
<i>
Let them go. Let them go.</i>

1611
01:20:36,850 --> 01:20:38,400

1612
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:43,350
Tell me I'm hallucinating.

1613
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:45,100
You are not here right now.

1614
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:49,600
You all right?

1615
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:52,800
We'll get out of here.

1616
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:53,900

1617
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:55,250
Don't-don't worry-
don't worry.

1618
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:57,300
We'll get out of here.
What? What?

1619
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:58,600
What Django always say?

1620
01:20:58,600 --> 01:20:59,600
Don't, man.

1621
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:00,950
Come on.
What does Django always say?

1622
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:03,000
Don't.

1623
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,600
Slow and steady
wins the race every time.

1624
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:09,100
What the fuck
have we won, Django?

1625
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:12,500
Have a look
around you, man.

1626
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,700
Look, I know
it's hard right now,

1627
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:23,950
but you got to-
you got to stick with it, man.

1628
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:25,800
I mean, your brother's up there
rooting for you,

1629
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,050
rooting for all of us.

1630
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,500
Come on, man.

1631
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:36,150
I mean, besides,
a week ago,

1632
01:21:36,150 --> 01:21:39,350
nobody knew what the hell
the WTO was.

1633
01:21:39,350 --> 01:21:44,000
Now they still don't know
what the WTO is, but...

1634
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000

1635
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,200
At least they know
it's bad, you know?

1636
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:53,800
Yes.

1637
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,450
How long have we been trying
to save this planet?

1638
01:21:58,450 --> 01:21:59,900
Ah...

1639
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:02,800
Not long enough.

1640
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,000
Yeah, it's still
quite a mess, huh?

1641
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,400
Oh, yeah.

1642
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,850

1643
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:25,800
<i>II</i>

1644
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:43,300

1645
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:14,400
I love you.

1646
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,050
At the beginning of this week,

1647
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:38,050
we came here with hope
in our hearts

1648
01:23:38,050 --> 01:23:42,400
to try and find better solutions
for our countries.

1649
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:43,950
We were promised these rounds

1650
01:23:43,950 --> 01:23:46,200
would be different
from the last time,

1651
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:49,450
that our trade concerns
would be heard.

1652
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:52,100
But we have been treated
like no more than animals.

1653
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,700
The manipulation
of third-world countries

1654
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:59,000
is simply another form
of colonialism.

1655
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,100

1656
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:05,750
You may try to silence me,
but I will have my say.

1657
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:08,150
<i>Like the protesters
outside of this building,</i>

1658
01:24:08,150 --> 01:24:10,800
I will be heard!

1659
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,150
We have been blindsided
and marginalized

1660
01:24:13,150 --> 01:24:15,200
on issues of vital importance.

1661
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:18,450
<i>Transparency and openness
have not existed here.</i>

1662
01:24:18,450 --> 01:24:20,850
Therefore, we will not
join the consensus required

1663
01:24:20,850 --> 01:24:23,250
to meet the objectives
of this conference.

1664
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:25,050
No more will we stand idly by

1665
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:27,550
as our countries
are abused and exploited!

1666
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:31,000

1667
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:41,750
<i>
The people united
will never be defeated.</i>

1668
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:44,900
The people united
will never be defeated.

01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:47,050
Everybody on the inside...

1670
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:49,000

A complete collapse...

1679
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:05,900
Of the WTO talks.

1680
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:07,800
Of the WTO talks.

1681
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:09,100

01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:11,000
Did you hear that'?

1684
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,500
It happened, man.

01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:16,300

1686
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:18,350
Little by little.

1687
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:19,800
I told you.

1688
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,800

<i>

1696
