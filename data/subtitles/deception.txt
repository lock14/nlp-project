1
00:02:08,678 --> 00:02:10,551
10:53 pm.

2
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:14,721
Sorry for scaring you like that.
I was just heading home and uh...

3
00:02:15,017 --> 00:02:18,433
we met before in the can.
-Oh, you're Wyatt, right?

4
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:22,601
Yeah. So, you working late or you
downloading a multitude of porn?

5
00:02:22,858 --> 00:02:26,358
I have to be out of here by tomorrow
so I'm just trying to finish up,

6
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:29,150
what about you?
-You kidding? This is an early night.

7
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,363
Hard to believe once upon a time...

8
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,985
it was a measure of a man's success
on how little he worked.

9
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:39,572
What's the deal? Our firm hires you
to bless our books they send you?

10
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm the audit manager, yeah. I handle
the same 7 or 8 clients every year.

11
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:46,171
I must've done Stern
for something like four years now.

12
00:02:46,257 --> 00:02:50,337
Wow. So you like this work?
-I do. The order of it appeals to me...

13
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:53,472
the symmetry.

14
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:56,640
It's alright, I guess,
if you like workin' with numbers.

15
00:02:56,726 --> 00:02:58,718
Do you like being a lawyer?

16
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:02,346
Yeah, it's alright, I guess,
if you like workin' with assholes.

17
00:03:03,524 --> 00:03:07,522
I'm probably disturbing you, so...
-Hey, no, it's alright. I'm almost done.

18
00:03:07,611 --> 00:03:10,281
Really.
-Oh.

19
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:12,024
So...

20
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,114
Worth and Berman, huh?
Did they headhunt you?

21
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:22,115
Yeah, my senior year of college.
They subsidized my graduate degree.

22
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:25,329
Ah, I see.
So you were... you were poor, right?

23
00:03:27,465 --> 00:03:30,715
I guess I was.
I was brought up by my mom on her own

24
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:34,336
and she died when I was 19
and so it was kind of like a lifeline.

25
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:38,848
Wow. Sounds like you needed it.
-I'm sure there's a lot of people

26
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:41,011
that had it worse.
-Not here.

27
00:03:41,103 --> 00:03:44,307
Practically every suit I know
is Harvard by way of Andover.

28
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:46,307
Are you?
-Oh, hell no. No, no.

29
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,027
I'm Princeton by way of Exeter.
-But that's like the same. Oh yeah.

30
00:03:52,323 --> 00:03:55,028
So, Jonathan...

31
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,194
I think I have something here
which might help you to focus.

32
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,245
You smoke?
-Not for a long time.

33
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:06,537
Good. This'll give you a real buzz,
then.

34
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:17,927
I don't know...
I just sometimes feel so, uh...

35
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:24,847
you know...
removed.

36
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:30,102
I work for one of the biggest
accounting firms in the world

37
00:04:30,194 --> 00:04:32,659
and there's not so much as
a desk there to prove it.

38
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,729
My new senior manager

39
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:36,361
I haven't even met him in person yet.

40
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,985
I try to meet people at work
but it's always the same.

41
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:43,754
To the accounting
staff I'm a pain because

42
00:04:43,756 --> 00:04:45,868
for two weeks they
have to hold their breath.

43
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,877
They hope I don't pick up
any of their screw-ups.

44
00:04:48,963 --> 00:04:52,498
To everyone else I'm just a
temporary fixture so why bother.

45
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:58,675
Sometimes...

46
00:04:58,764 --> 00:05:02,762
I sit and I look through the glass,
and I see life...

47
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:08,641
literally passing me by.
-Jonathan.

48
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:10,726
Yeah?

49
00:05:11,193 --> 00:05:12,749
By the clock on that wall there

50
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,235
you have been talking for
thirty-seven minutes straight.

51
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:29,161
I don't remember a word I said.

52
00:05:33,215 --> 00:05:36,216
So, God says to Jesus...

53
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:42,506
I haven't felt this good
since I saw Van Halen in '97.

54
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:06,239
<i>Stand clear of the
closing doors, please.</i>

55
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:52,913
Is this the train to Canal Street?
-Yes, this is the right train.

56
00:08:47,576 --> 00:08:51,111
So, I guess that's it.
This is my report for Mr. Cross.

57
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:55,366
Could you point me towards
Wyatt Bose's office, please?

58
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:57,582
Who?
-Wyatt Bose. He's one of your...

59
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,671
Hey, quit looking
down Daphne's shirt.

60
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:02,915
So, get in, get out, huh?
So where's next?

61
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:06,212
Clancey Funds on Friday
and then Clute-Nichols after that.

62
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,304
Sounds like fun.
Wait up a sec.

63
00:09:10,057 --> 00:09:12,892
Good to meet you, Jonathan.
-You, too.

64
00:09:12,977 --> 00:09:16,180
So... wait.
You have the day off tomorrow?

65
00:09:17,898 --> 00:09:19,558
How's your backhand?

66
00:10:04,361 --> 00:10:07,232
I'm sorry.
-Good game.

67
00:10:07,323 --> 00:10:08,983
Commiserations, McQuarry.

68
00:10:09,074 --> 00:10:12,906
You develop a killer instinct,
you'll beat the crap out of me.

69
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:15,751
You know, when these
things first came out,

70
00:10:15,752 --> 00:10:17,536
I think I was a frosh
at boarding school.

71
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:20,412
Geez, where did you get this thing?
You steal it from Jimmy Connors?

72
00:10:20,503 --> 00:10:21,739
What is it? Natural gut, hm?

73
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,037
No, it's a hybrid weave
of natural gut and Kevlar.

74
00:10:24,038 --> 00:10:24,664
Kevlar?

75
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,960
Yeah, I should have 'em replaced.
They're pretty frayed.

76
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:35,301
Those two girls were so pretty.

77
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,061
You don't get much, do you?

78
00:10:41,524 --> 00:10:44,097
Do you mean sex?
-No, flood insurance.

79
00:10:44,193 --> 00:10:45,542
How many women
have you slept with?

80
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:47,524
I don't know.

81
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,675
Of course you know.
Everyone knows.

82
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:53,075
Maybe four.
-Maybe four?

83
00:10:53,828 --> 00:10:56,532
Alright. Four.
What about you?

84
00:10:56,622 --> 00:11:00,157
Me? I have no idea.
-You just said everyone knows.

85
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:04,918
I meant everyone like you.
C'mon, hurry up. Let's go for a drink.

86
00:11:05,756 --> 00:11:10,169
You can borrow something of mine.
Ah. Guten Abend, Herr Kleiner.

87
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,298
This way, Jonathan.

88
00:11:21,564 --> 00:11:23,437
Like it?

89
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:25,852
It's a Gerhard Richter.

90
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:28,736
Actually, Kleiner, the
guy we just saw downstairs,

91
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,944
he's a hotshot art dealer.

92
00:11:31,031 --> 00:11:33,902
He hooked me up with this
fantastic gallery in Munich.

93
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,069
I'll be back in a second.

94
00:12:00,436 --> 00:12:03,141
Try this one.

95
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:05,554
What?

96
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:09,357
C'mon, Jonathan.

97
00:12:09,445 --> 00:12:11,526
You remind me of
this guy, Jamie Getz.

98
00:12:11,527 --> 00:12:13,608
I met him my freshman
year at Princeton.

99
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:16,389
Oh, he was real smart.
He was witty, too,

100
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,824
when you loosened him up.
But he had this...

101
00:12:18,913 --> 00:12:22,447
brown. Now you assume
that he never scaled that wall.

102
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,498
The truth is he was
the only one that got in.

103
00:12:28,005 --> 00:12:31,208
What happened to him?
-Oh, he killed himself.

104
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:32,498
What?

105
00:12:36,305 --> 00:12:37,965
You're kidding.

106
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,766
Go get changed.
-Down here?

107
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,849
Down there.
Second door on the right.

108
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,783
Okay, Jonathan,
so just the four, huh?

109
00:13:06,877 --> 00:13:09,582
Oh, come on.
Now, look...

110
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,255
I've never been
too adventuresome.

111
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:16,629
What's the lamest?
-Well, I once...

112
00:13:17,846 --> 00:13:19,925
No, c'mon, c'mon,
share it with the group.

113
00:13:19,926 --> 00:13:21,761
I once phoned one
of those sex lines.

114
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,961
Alright, now we're talking.

115
00:13:22,962 --> 00:13:25,101
I talked to girl named
Star for like half an hour.

116
00:13:25,187 --> 00:13:30,348
I ended up explaining a Section 179
deduction on the new Escalade.

117
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,849
You paid to give tax
advice on a sex line?

118
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,359
That's about the size of it.

119
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:40,400
Oh, thank you for sharing, Jonathan.
That is pretty lame.

120
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,578
Oh, hello.

121
00:13:48,085 --> 00:13:51,584
Do you... is she looking at me?
-Yeah, she's looking at you.

122
00:13:51,672 --> 00:13:54,875
No, she's not. C'mon.
-Maybe it's the suit?

123
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:59,838
Listen, you don't think
women have the same urges?

124
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:03,465
Successful women working their
asses off to stay that way?

125
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,638
And?

126
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:08,807
Well, let's just say there's a way
that it can be taken care of.

127
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,225
You make it sound
like a mob hit.

128
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,247
Had a good time tonight?
-I had a great time tonight.

129
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:36,418
I did. I had a great time.
-Whoa. I wasn't sure at one point.

130
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,797
No, I'm shy. But...

131
00:14:38,886 --> 00:14:42,053
Thank you. And thanks for the tennis
and for takin' me out.

132
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:46,219
It's okay. Tennis anytime.
Particularly if you play that badly.

133
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,390
At the corner, please.
The Waldorf Astoria.

134
00:14:49,813 --> 00:14:52,102
I gotta go meet somebody.

135
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:55,311
Take care. Have a nice night.
-I'll call you tomorrow.

136
00:15:11,293 --> 00:15:14,045
Any problems, you're gonna
want to see Julie Levinson.

137
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:16,205
She's our Assistant Controller.

138
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,465
But, like I said,
I don't anticipate any problems.

139
00:15:21,178 --> 00:15:24,428
Never had any before.
-Okay. Thanks.

140
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:37,685
It's really nice out here.
I usually just brown bag it.

141
00:15:37,778 --> 00:15:40,844
You have to get outside. Those
fluorescent lights will kill you.

142
00:15:40,845 --> 00:15:41,645
I read about them.

143
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:47,485
Hello.

144
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:53,118
Shit.
No, I got it here. Hold on.

145
00:15:54,878 --> 00:15:59,218
See if you can change it to the
6:30 out of JFK flight number four.

146
00:15:59,219 --> 00:15:59,920
Right. Yeah.

147
00:16:03,178 --> 00:16:06,547
Rutherford wants me
to join him in London ASAP.

148
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,935
We're papering some finance with Lloyds.
I tell you about this?

149
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:10,092
No.

150
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:13,685
I'll be gone a couple weeks.
-Sounds sort of interesting.

151
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:16,892
Gonna be as boring as sin, but...
Anyhow, I gotta get back.

152
00:16:16,984 --> 00:16:18,526
Ready?
-Alright.

153
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:27,237
That's disgusting.
I don't want to hear that.

154
00:16:27,328 --> 00:16:28,786
Why?

155
00:16:28,871 --> 00:16:32,406
That's repulsive.
Don't ever tell anyone that. Ever.

156
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:36,118
You're the kind of girl that pees
in front of men, aren't you?

157
00:16:36,211 --> 00:16:39,746
What goes in the Xerox Room
stays in the Xerox room.

158
00:16:39,923 --> 00:16:43,127
Jonathan McQuarry, hello.

159
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,053
Hello?

160
00:16:54,688 --> 00:16:57,265
Wyatt? It's me, Jonathon.
Look, I've got your cell phone.

161
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,397
I guess, you've got mine.
What a pain in the ass.

162
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,152
You're probably in
the air right, so,

163
00:17:03,153 --> 00:17:05,151
if you get this,
give me a call on your phone.

164
00:17:06,033 --> 00:17:08,275
I'll speak to you later.
Take care.

165
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,739
Mr. Lewman. Hi.
-Yes, hello.

166
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:19,246
Actually, Mr. Lewman, there was
something I wanted to talk to you about.

167
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:19,666
Excuse me.

168
00:17:21,965 --> 00:17:24,373
Hello?
Are you free tonight?

169
00:17:24,468 --> 00:17:28,217
Look, this isn't actually...
Sorry, could you just hold on a sec?

170
00:17:28,305 --> 00:17:31,721
Mr. Lewman, my bedroom...
I think I have a leak.

171
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:36,051
I was hoping you could take a look.
McQuarry. 631.

172
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:39,973
Oh, right. McQuarry.
Yeah, I'll get to it soon as I can.

173
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:42,896
Hello?
Anyone there?

174
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,962
Hello?
Are you free tonight?

175
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:06,127
Actually, I am, but this isn't Wyatt.
-Sorry, I didn't get that.

176
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:10,421
Well, I am free, but... -Could
you be at The Dylan in one hour?

177
00:18:10,514 --> 00:18:12,590
I guess so, but...

178
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,360
Are you waiting for me?
-Yes, I think so.

179
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,452
Would you like a drink or something?
-No, thanks.

180
00:19:15,537 --> 00:19:19,072
I've got a conference call
with Tokyo early in the morning.

181
00:19:20,084 --> 00:19:22,207
Shall we go?
-Yes.

182
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:38,844
Have you been in this hotel before?
-No.

183
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:51,067
Look, the person who you thought
you were talking to isn't me.

184
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,490
You're not who I spoke to on the phone?
-No, no... Yes, yes, I am.

185
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:00,080
But...
-What's wrong?

186
00:20:00,207 --> 00:20:03,742
Are you not attracted to me?
-Oh, you're beautiful.

187
00:20:05,212 --> 00:20:08,663
It's just you called me
and I came here but I don't...

188
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:11,960
You don't?
-I'm not too sure what's going on.

189
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,796
You're not too sure
what's going on?

190
00:20:23,897 --> 00:20:26,186
Sit down. Sit down.

191
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:41,006
Hello.
-Hey, you're up early.

192
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,634
Hey! How's London?
-Rainy. So you got mine, I got yours.

193
00:21:44,895 --> 00:21:47,849
Yeah, I must've grabbed it at lunch
before you left.

194
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,042
No big deal. I already had
my work calls forwarded here.

195
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:51,640
Oh, alright.

196
00:21:51,735 --> 00:21:54,855
So, did I get any calls?
-Yes, you did.

197
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:57,736
And?
-Well...

198
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,617
What the hell was that?
-I knew it. You met up with someone.

199
00:22:01,703 --> 00:22:05,369
I thought you would call me back.
-Oh, spare me. I woulda done the same.

200
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:08,909
So how was it?
-It was really amazing, actually. She...

201
00:22:09,002 --> 00:22:11,847
Shit. I'll call you later.
They want me in a meeting.

202
00:22:11,848 --> 00:22:13,296
I want to hear all about
it though, alright?

203
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:16,835
Alright. -Hey as far as my phone,
feel free to use it.

204
00:22:17,428 --> 00:22:19,420
Okay. Thanks.

205
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,573
Yes?

206
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:40,735
Hello. Uh...

207
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:43,945
Yes?
-Are you free tonight?

208
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:49,291
Where?
-Where, right.

209
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:53,420
The Dylan Hotel.
-Perhaps The Park Avenue.

210
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,581
In the bar, half past eleven.

211
00:23:20,741 --> 00:23:24,157
If you are who you don't seem to be,
you're late.

212
00:23:24,495 --> 00:23:27,199
Excuse me?
-Are you?

213
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:32,452
Late, or who I'm not supposed to be?

214
00:23:33,086 --> 00:23:34,331
Either.

215
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:40,381
Yes, I am late,
and I am who I don't seem to be.

216
00:23:40,928 --> 00:23:42,256
Alright, then.

217
00:23:46,308 --> 00:23:49,759
Could you put this on the room, please?
-Yes, ma'am.

218
00:23:49,853 --> 00:23:52,558
I don't have a room.

219
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:57,269
You're rather new to this,
aren't you?

220
00:23:58,111 --> 00:24:00,986
The initiator is
responsible for the room.

221
00:24:00,987 --> 00:24:02,524
That's one of the rules.

222
00:24:02,616 --> 00:24:05,617
Oh. So I should...
-Precisely.

223
00:24:06,036 --> 00:24:07,779
Oh. Excuse me.

224
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:15,333
Frankly, I'm surprised whoever
sponsored you didn't explain more.

225
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,955
Downstairs, you talked about a rule.
Are there others?

226
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:22,792
No rough stuff. If that's your thing,
take it elsewhere.

227
00:24:23,554 --> 00:24:27,421
No business talk, and no names.
-Right.

228
00:24:30,227 --> 00:24:32,932
How did you get into this?
-A friend of mine...

229
00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:36,437
He introduced you to the list
but failed to explain the basics?

230
00:24:36,525 --> 00:24:37,848
Well, he had to leave town.

231
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:39,858
I'm doing something
wrong here, aren't I?

232
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:43,361
It's not that. You just strike me
as something of a stowaway.

233
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:47,197
If it wasn't for the $4,000 suit,
I'd say you didn't belong here at all.

234
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:48,828
This is us.

235
00:24:51,331 --> 00:24:54,083
Although,
someone obviously thought you did.

236
00:24:54,168 --> 00:24:56,326
And I'm a sucker for bashful boys.

237
00:25:09,391 --> 00:25:11,467
Can I ask you something?

238
00:25:15,272 --> 00:25:18,807
Why do you do this?
-For the same reason that men do it.

239
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,436
The economics of the arrangement.

240
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,481
Intimacy without intricacy.

241
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:32,238
I work past midnight almost every night.

242
00:25:33,415 --> 00:25:36,582
The last dinner I had that wasn't
business was about a year ago.

243
00:25:49,932 --> 00:25:53,466
Hey, Wyatt, it's Jonathan.
I haven't heard from you, but...

244
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:57,104
I guess you must be pretty
swamped over there.

245
00:25:57,189 --> 00:26:00,059
Look, I just wanted
to say thank you.

246
00:29:05,085 --> 00:29:08,086
Wait. Wait. Before we...

247
00:29:10,132 --> 00:29:13,666
The thing is, I know you.
I mean, not "know you" exactly.

248
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:18,346
We met before in the Times Square
subway station. It had been raining,

249
00:29:19,474 --> 00:29:23,009
and you asked me if the
train stops at Canal Street.

250
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:31,433
No.

251
00:29:32,821 --> 00:29:36,570
Wait. It just feels a little strange,
that's all.

252
00:29:37,784 --> 00:29:40,904
Why?
Because you've seen me before?

253
00:29:41,163 --> 00:29:44,863
Maybe. It's just...
-C'mon, what's the problem?

254
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:49,249
Okay...

255
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:54,255
I guess it is a little bit
of a gear shift.

256
00:30:02,392 --> 00:30:04,468
Maybe some other time.

257
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:12,894
Oh, no, please.
What I mean is...

258
00:30:13,487 --> 00:30:16,903
By any chance...
are you hungry?

259
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:24,657
Mm, you have a little bit of...
of ketchup on your chin.

260
00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:29,829
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm a messy eater.
-No, it's okay. So am I. Here.

261
00:30:32,089 --> 00:30:34,165
There you go.
-Thank you.

262
00:30:35,676 --> 00:30:39,341
You have a little piece of...
-Oh, what, onion in my hair?

263
00:30:46,395 --> 00:30:49,479
So what do you do for a living?

264
00:30:50,107 --> 00:30:53,523
I sit behind glass
and I watch people pass like fish.

265
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:56,730
You work in a bank?
-I'm sort of an accountant.

266
00:30:56,947 --> 00:31:00,150
I bet that's what you always
dreamed of being when you grew up.

267
00:31:00,242 --> 00:31:02,911
Oh, yeah, I'm livin' the dream.
Feel free to leave now.

268
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:06,580
Still here.

269
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:10,501
But how about you?
-No.

270
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:14,001
No, no, no, I'm afraid
that we're still on you.

271
00:31:14,715 --> 00:31:16,672
Frank.
-Frank?

272
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:20,927
You look like a Frank.

273
00:31:23,306 --> 00:31:26,426
By the way, my name is...
-Oh, sh.

274
00:31:26,977 --> 00:31:29,016
You know the rules.
No names.

275
00:31:29,104 --> 00:31:32,224
Yeah, but the rules seem to
specify no conversation either.

276
00:31:33,775 --> 00:31:39,149
Okay. How 'bout I tell you my name,
if you guess.

277
00:31:39,823 --> 00:31:43,239
Oh, you're in real trouble here.
You see, I am very good at this.

278
00:31:43,327 --> 00:31:46,861
What are you very good at?
-Problem solving. It's what I do.

279
00:31:47,164 --> 00:31:51,541
I'm very good at identifying hierarchical
relationships and binary posits.

280
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:53,750
Is that right?
-Absolutely.

281
00:31:53,837 --> 00:31:56,755
And this talent can be applied
to finding anything.

282
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,592
For example, I know that
your name begins with an S.

283
00:32:01,595 --> 00:32:05,130
How do you know that?
-I saw your key chain on your purse.

284
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:08,758
Wow. Excellent work.
-Thank you. So, the things we know are

285
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:12,518
A, your name begins with an S.
B, you have a white coat.

286
00:32:12,606 --> 00:32:14,148
And C...

287
00:32:15,192 --> 00:32:18,311
And C, you do not know
your way around the subway.

288
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,018
That's true.

289
00:32:20,113 --> 00:32:24,277
Now all I do is extrapolate from
these known qualities and your name...

290
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:26,650
is...

291
00:32:28,622 --> 00:32:29,950
Sybil.

292
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:35,242
Sophie. You're definitely a Sophie.
-Wait, with an "ie" or a "y"?

293
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:37,045
Either.
-Neither.

294
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:40,507
How about Syd, as in Syd Charisse?
-No, she was Syd with a C.

295
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:44,127
Yeah, but maybe you spell it with an S.
-I do not.

296
00:32:44,805 --> 00:32:48,008
Sexy Steffi was lookin' for a train...
-No.

297
00:32:48,308 --> 00:32:51,511
Sunbeam.
-Oh, God, do I look like a Sunbeam?

298
00:32:51,812 --> 00:32:53,187
Absolutely.

299
00:32:55,482 --> 00:32:57,024
Well, then, that's it.

300
00:32:59,569 --> 00:33:03,270
I told you I was good at this.
-I'm very impressed.

301
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:11,283
I'm crashing.

302
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:17,166
I'd really like to see you again.
Not in a hotel.

303
00:33:18,213 --> 00:33:21,084
Hm, well...
we'll see about that.

304
00:33:22,384 --> 00:33:26,132
Maybe tomorrow?
-It is tomorrow.

305
00:34:31,912 --> 00:34:33,988
Hello?
Are you free tonight?

306
00:34:34,081 --> 00:34:37,615
Hey, are you back?
-I wish. It's friggin' anarchy here.

307
00:34:37,751 --> 00:34:39,790
Hang on. Hello?

308
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:42,998
Housekeeping.
-Uh, could you come back? Thanks.

309
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,963
Sorry.
-Where are you?

310
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,837
I'm in the Soho Grand.
-Soho Grand, huh?

311
00:34:47,928 --> 00:34:50,149
Sounds like you've
been enjoying yourself.

312
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:52,008
I have.
I met this girl last night,

313
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:53,264
and I broke all the rules

314
00:34:53,265 --> 00:34:55,550
and I had an honest-to-God
conversation with her.

315
00:34:55,644 --> 00:34:59,179
That's extremely naughty of you.
Who is she, Romeo?

316
00:34:59,523 --> 00:35:00,793
I have no idea, really.

317
00:35:00,794 --> 00:35:03,223
I don't know very much
about her yet, but...

318
00:35:03,318 --> 00:35:04,737
I'm gonna see her again.

319
00:35:04,738 --> 00:35:07,102
I don't want to
dampen your spirits...

320
00:35:07,197 --> 00:35:10,317
What?
-You met her through the list.

321
00:35:10,951 --> 00:35:13,027
She's different.
Trust me.

322
00:35:14,621 --> 00:35:16,946
So when are you back?
-Hard to say.

323
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,409
It's back-to-back bullshit here.
But next week, I hope.

324
00:35:20,502 --> 00:35:23,918
Well, good luck.
I'll see you when you get back.

325
00:35:24,297 --> 00:35:25,756
You, too.

326
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:36,720
Hello?
Are you free tonight?

327
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,886
I'm sorry,
you have the wrong number.

328
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:55,737
Hello?
Hey, are you free tonight?

329
00:35:56,621 --> 00:36:00,701
Can you meet me in Chinatown,
on Doyer Street? Say, eight o'clock?

330
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:02,074
Okay.

331
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:34,275
I got you a present.

332
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:38,995
Thank you.
-It looks great on you.

333
00:36:44,586 --> 00:36:46,045
Let's go.
-Yeah.

334
00:37:01,645 --> 00:37:04,515
We'd like...
we'd like one of these.

335
00:37:05,565 --> 00:37:08,981
And... one of these...
oh, and that.

336
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:11,606
Thank you.

337
00:37:14,991 --> 00:37:18,407
What did you order?
-I have absolutely no idea.

338
00:37:18,995 --> 00:37:22,993
How do you know we'll like it?
-How do you know we won't?

339
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:29,212
This is so not my life.

340
00:37:29,506 --> 00:37:33,373
Ever since that night on the subway
I haven't stopped thinking about you.

341
00:37:33,468 --> 00:37:35,544
I'm not sure I believe you.

342
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:42,218
I mean, you're in a sex club.
I'm not judging you. I'm in there, too.

343
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:46,390
But don't say you've been
solemnly holding a torch for me for...

344
00:37:46,648 --> 00:37:49,898
long now, one month?
-Point taken.

345
00:37:53,196 --> 00:37:55,272
I got you a present.

346
00:38:03,623 --> 00:38:06,541
Oh, he is so cute.

347
00:38:12,299 --> 00:38:13,709
Thank you.

348
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:29,314
Here.
-Thanks.

349
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,440
What is that?

350
00:38:38,825 --> 00:38:40,367
Ginseng gum.

351
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,365
It's terrible.

352
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:49,078
I guess it does sort of
taste like hairspray.

353
00:38:49,669 --> 00:38:53,418
I think I got it now.
I think your name is Suki.

354
00:39:00,347 --> 00:39:02,423
What?
What are you thinking about?

355
00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:10,434
I don't want to complicate your life.
-No...

356
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,058
I want all the
complications you've got.

357
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:21,650
Maybe you should go?

358
00:39:24,496 --> 00:39:26,239
Maybe you should stay.

359
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:32,179
I know we decided not to rush, but...

360
00:40:33,607 --> 00:40:38,601
Just for the record, I'm doing everything
I can just to apply the brakes here.

361
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,565
Oh, me too.

362
00:40:42,866 --> 00:40:45,439
Our parents would be proud.

363
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:51,624
But just say...

364
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:53,876
Say what?

365
00:40:56,463 --> 00:40:58,040
If we acted...

366
00:40:58,131 --> 00:41:00,478
just suddenly tore
off the rest of these

367
00:41:00,479 --> 00:41:02,425
clothes to consummate their deep...

368
00:41:03,386 --> 00:41:06,672
human needs in a frenzy of...

369
00:41:06,973 --> 00:41:08,681
Fucking and sucking.

370
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:12,680
Beautifully put.

371
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,435
You were saying?
-Well...

372
00:41:20,195 --> 00:41:23,813
Who could blame these two people?
-Who could possibly judge them?

373
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:26,027
Who would know?

374
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:36,292
I got it.
-Where are you going?

375
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:40,996
Ice.

376
00:41:42,175 --> 00:41:44,251
Oh, you gonna get some ice, huh?

377
00:41:45,011 --> 00:41:48,131
There's a machine out in the hallway.
I'll be right back.

378
00:41:49,015 --> 00:41:52,550
I'll get the ice.
You stay here, I'll get the ice.

379
00:41:53,186 --> 00:41:55,891
Jonathan. Wait.
-No, I'll go.

380
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:22,247
Would you like some help?

381
00:42:23,425 --> 00:42:26,260
I can manage. Thank you.

382
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:44,603
I can't get the card to work.

383
00:42:47,907 --> 00:42:48,939
Hello?

384
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:51,900
Hello?

385
00:44:29,926 --> 00:44:30,957
Hello!

386
00:44:36,266 --> 00:44:37,297
Hello?

387
00:44:38,727 --> 00:44:40,304
Sir. Sir!

388
00:44:56,286 --> 00:44:58,777
Mr. McQuarry, Detective Russo.

389
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:04,494
How're you doing?
-Not too good.

390
00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:08,957
This is Detective Burke.
I need a background check.

391
00:45:09,049 --> 00:45:11,622
Last name McQuarry,
first name Jonathan.

392
00:45:11,718 --> 00:45:14,256
And you don't know
anything about her?

393
00:45:14,346 --> 00:45:17,713
Where she works, where she
lives, her phone number?

394
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,426
Like I said,

395
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:22,309
all I know about her
is her first name starts with an S.

396
00:45:22,395 --> 00:45:24,471
Is she a prostitute?
-No.

397
00:45:26,107 --> 00:45:30,437
I told you, she's a friend.
-A friend you met in a sex group.

398
00:45:33,323 --> 00:45:38,364
Look, who else is in this sex group?
-I don't know. It's not like that.

399
00:45:38,453 --> 00:45:39,995
It's anonymous.

400
00:45:40,288 --> 00:45:42,447
You walked into the room
and saw blood?

401
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,835
Yeah, I saw blood and
then someone hit me,

402
00:45:44,836 --> 00:45:46,490
and when I came to she was gone.

403
00:45:46,586 --> 00:45:49,753
And you didn't see who hit you?
-No, they were behind me.

404
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:53,043
They must've been hiding in the bathroom.
-Well, was there anything stolen?

405
00:45:53,134 --> 00:45:56,669
Your wallet, or jewelry or anything?
-No, I have my wallet.

406
00:45:56,763 --> 00:46:00,013
Look, Detective, please,
you've got to find her.

407
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:03,385
We can't do anything until I
understand what happened tonight.

408
00:46:03,478 --> 00:46:05,554
I told you what happened tonight.

409
00:46:11,111 --> 00:46:14,314
Have you ever had
experiences like this before?

410
00:46:14,406 --> 00:46:17,691
No. What're you talking about?
-We spoke to the desk clerk,

411
00:46:17,784 --> 00:46:19,860
and he only recalls
seeing you check in.

412
00:46:21,788 --> 00:46:24,006
And as for the blood
you say you saw,

413
00:46:24,007 --> 00:46:26,165
we checked the room
and found nothing.

414
00:46:26,251 --> 00:46:29,371
In fact, the only blood we found
is where you hit your head.

415
00:46:33,925 --> 00:46:36,498
Look, I know it all sounds...

416
00:46:38,096 --> 00:46:41,547
But I swear there's a woman
in serious trouble right now.

417
00:46:41,641 --> 00:46:43,717
A woman whose name
you don't know.

418
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:46,301
Yes.

419
00:46:49,524 --> 00:46:53,522
Look, clearly, you had a tough night.
-I'm not crazy.

420
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:58,697
I tell you what. Go home, and if you
remember anything, you give me a call.

421
00:48:22,315 --> 00:48:24,473
Hey, Wyatt, it's me, Jonathan.

422
00:48:25,693 --> 00:48:28,777
Look, something happened
to me last night.

423
00:48:28,863 --> 00:48:31,899
Could you call me back
when you get a chance?

424
00:48:31,991 --> 00:48:34,067
I really need to speak to you.

425
00:48:35,828 --> 00:48:36,381
Can I help you?

426
00:48:36,382 --> 00:48:39,031
I'm trying to get into contact with
one of your attorneys, Wyatt Bose.

427
00:48:39,123 --> 00:48:42,290
I know he's working out of
your London office right now

428
00:48:42,376 --> 00:48:44,355
but I wondered if I can speak
to his assistant or anyone

429
00:48:44,356 --> 00:48:46,291
that would know how to
get in touch with him immediately.

430
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,839
Of course. Just a minute.

431
00:48:48,549 --> 00:48:50,817
Are you sure that you
have the right firm?

432
00:48:50,818 --> 00:48:52,927
Yes, I met him here
when I was working.

433
00:48:53,012 --> 00:48:56,428
Wyatt Bose, he's six-one,
he has black hair. Wait.

434
00:48:57,391 --> 00:49:02,468
I have his... I have his card.
You see? Look. Wyatt Bose.

435
00:49:04,106 --> 00:49:07,357
I can assure you there is no one
by this name working in this firm.

436
00:49:07,443 --> 00:49:08,972
No, but I've seen
him in these halls.

437
00:49:08,973 --> 00:49:11,144
For Christ's Sake we smoked
pot in the conference room.

438
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,697
Excuse me?

439
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:18,279
Wait! Hey, wait
I'm trying to get hold of Wyatt.

440
00:49:18,371 --> 00:49:20,909
Who?
-Wyatt Bose. I saw you talking with him.

441
00:49:20,998 --> 00:49:24,663
You cracked jokes with him in the lobby.
-I crack jokes with a lot of people.

442
00:49:24,752 --> 00:49:28,501
Are you trying to tell me you don't...
-Hey! Easy with the hands. What is this?

443
00:49:28,589 --> 00:49:33,002
He said he was going to London
with a Mr. Rutherford to paper a deal.

444
00:49:33,094 --> 00:49:37,305
Mr. McQuarry, Mr. Rutherford
is presently recovering from hip surgery.

445
00:49:37,682 --> 00:49:39,342
In New Jersey.

446
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:53,105
Yes?
-I'm sorry. I'm looking for Wyatt.

447
00:49:54,198 --> 00:49:57,698
Excuse me. Wyatt?
-Yeah, Wyatt Bose. He lives here.

448
00:49:57,785 --> 00:50:01,320
Uh, in, in this building?
No, I'm sorry, he must be new.

449
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:04,451
No, not in this building.
In this apartment.

450
00:50:04,542 --> 00:50:08,414
No, wait, that painting.
It's a Gerhard Richter, right?

451
00:50:08,416 --> 00:50:08,622
Yes.

452
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,083
From the gallery in Munich
that Herr Kleiner handled.

453
00:50:12,174 --> 00:50:14,416
The art dealer downstairs.

454
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:18,045
Downstairs you must mean Mr. Moretti.
But he's in the carpet business.

455
00:50:21,684 --> 00:50:23,760
Young man, are you alright?

456
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,335
She's a looker.
You weren't kidding.

457
00:51:41,013 --> 00:51:44,133
I can see why she had
you all hot and bothered.

458
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:48,266
Oh, Jesus Christ, it was you.
Where is she?

459
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,012
God damn it, Wyatt...

460
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:57,858
I need you to listen. You're starting
next week at Clute-Nichols, yes?

461
00:51:57,947 --> 00:51:59,275
Who are you?

462
00:51:59,365 --> 00:52:01,856
I'm your only shot
at seeing her alive again.

463
00:52:01,951 --> 00:52:05,071
I asked you a fucking question.
-Yes.

464
00:52:05,204 --> 00:52:07,411
Have a seat.
Sit down.

465
00:52:11,085 --> 00:52:12,433
Now, as standard part of their audit

466
00:52:12,434 --> 00:52:15,747
you've temporary access to all
accounts and wire protocols.

467
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,914
That's what this is about?
-Jonathan.

468
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,305
I want you to locate
some accounts for me.

469
00:52:21,306 --> 00:52:23,173
You're gonna move
some money around.

470
00:52:24,265 --> 00:52:26,388
I can't.
-What?

471
00:52:26,475 --> 00:52:29,455
They're client accounts.
There's safety...

472
00:52:29,456 --> 00:52:30,010
Listen!

473
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:34,732
I never said client accounts.
I mean some sub-accounts that I know of,

474
00:52:34,817 --> 00:52:38,897
outside the realm of your audit.
Masked accounts. Slush funds.

475
00:52:39,113 --> 00:52:42,114
Typical insider stuff, you know.
twenty mil or so,

476
00:52:42,199 --> 00:52:44,951
skimmed into a quiet account
for a rainy day.

477
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:47,500
You don't think they'll
notice when it's gone?

478
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:48,286
Eventually, yes.

479
00:52:48,372 --> 00:52:51,575
But they won't do shit about 'em
'cause it's dirty money.

480
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:54,870
I can't.
-This isn't a negotiation, Jonathan.

481
00:52:55,713 --> 00:52:58,833
Besides, we're friends, remember?

482
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:08,972
I'm warning you. Don't try and be a hero,
'cause people are gonna get hurt.

483
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,327
And you go to the cops,

484
00:53:10,328 --> 00:53:13,520
I'll make it look like you
cut her pretty little head off.

485
00:53:13,981 --> 00:53:18,442
Don't hurt her.
-Just do as you're instructed,

486
00:53:19,445 --> 00:53:23,359
and you'll have her back in no time.
-And why should I trust you?

487
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:28,902
Everything you told me was a lie.
-Oh, not lies, Jonathan.

488
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:33,115
That was foreplay.
And now you're fucked.

489
00:53:39,715 --> 00:53:41,257
I'll be watching.

490
00:54:08,869 --> 00:54:09,901
Hello?

491
00:54:18,462 --> 00:54:21,249
<i>You have one new voice message.</i>

492
00:54:21,632 --> 00:54:23,791
<i>New message one.</i>

493
00:54:23,884 --> 00:54:29,590
Are you free tonight? It's me, Tina.
I'm in town. I want to see you again.

494
00:54:29,974 --> 00:54:34,102
Six months is way too long.
I'm at the Rhiga, room 802.

495
00:54:34,603 --> 00:54:38,897
You better show. You owe me.
After all, I was your first.

496
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:07,626
Hello. This is the front desk.
Your guest has arrived.

497
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,344
You can go on up.
-Thank you.

498
00:55:34,288 --> 00:55:38,749
Who are you? What are you doing here?
-I believe I was invited.

499
00:55:39,877 --> 00:55:43,163
You have the wrong room.
-You didn't leave me a message,

500
00:55:43,255 --> 00:55:45,331
asking if I was free tonight?

501
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:50,959
I must've dialed the wrong number.

502
00:55:52,306 --> 00:55:55,426
Look, I meant to call someone else.
I'm sorry.

503
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,893
I need to speak
with you about Wyatt.

504
00:56:00,981 --> 00:56:03,223
I just need to ask you
a few questions, okay?

505
00:56:04,276 --> 00:56:08,357
I'm sorry, I don't know any Wyatt.
-Bullshit. You left him a message,

506
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:11,567
asking him to meet you here.
-I thought you said...

507
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:14,444
Who are you? How did you...

508
00:56:15,788 --> 00:56:19,620
What? No!
I just need a few answers.

509
00:56:20,042 --> 00:56:24,419
My name is Jonathan McQuarry.
I know you have no reason to help me,

510
00:56:24,505 --> 00:56:27,672
or even to believe me,
but I need to know about Wyatt.

511
00:56:27,758 --> 00:56:30,012
I told you, I don't know any Wyatt.

512
00:56:30,013 --> 00:56:32,586
That's the name of
the guy you called.

513
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:38,090
No, it isn't.

514
00:56:44,191 --> 00:56:45,602
I'm sorry.

515
00:56:50,489 --> 00:56:52,067
I'm really sorry.

516
00:56:59,206 --> 00:57:02,990
I'm really in trouble,
and this guy, he's...

517
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,540
he's dangerous.

518
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,802
It was in Chicago about a year ago,

519
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:14,261
at a private function
sponsored by my firm.

520
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:19,849
He was attending as a guest.
-A guest of who?

521
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:25,092
A guy called Hollaway.
Rudolph Holloway.

522
00:57:25,093 --> 00:57:27,107
I think they played
tennis together.

523
00:57:28,569 --> 00:57:31,855
He told me he'd just moved from
San Francisco and was in-between jobs.

524
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:36,658
He was extremely smart.

525
00:57:37,703 --> 00:57:42,412
I know it sounds silly, but he had this
way of making me feel close to him.

526
00:57:45,169 --> 00:57:47,245
I found myself telling him things.

527
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,632
I told him about this.

528
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,926
You told him about the list.

529
00:57:56,430 --> 00:57:57,461
Yeah.

530
00:58:00,851 --> 00:58:05,312
There was something about him.
Something terrifying.

531
00:58:10,194 --> 00:58:12,270
So why did you call him again?

532
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:19,570
You know when it's so good
you'd rather die than stop?

533
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,392
You want to kill someone.

534
00:58:23,393 --> 00:58:26,327
You wanna kill the person
you're doing it with.

535
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:41,261
Fuck it. Y'know what?
He was a good lay.

536
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:48,306
Okay, so what's his real name?

537
00:58:50,943 --> 00:58:53,814
Jamie.
-Jamie?

538
00:58:56,031 --> 00:58:58,783
That's his name.
Jamie Getz.

539
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:02,287
Jamie Getz.

540
01:00:10,606 --> 01:00:13,530
NYPD Dispatch.
How may I direct your call?

541
01:00:13,531 --> 01:00:14,686
Central Records.

542
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:19,478
Central.

543
01:00:19,573 --> 01:00:25,030
This is Detective Russo,
Precinct 22, badge number 15421.

544
01:00:26,288 --> 01:00:27,831
Go ahead, Detective.

545
01:00:28,415 --> 01:00:33,042
I need all you got for a missing person.
Last name Getz... G-E-T-Z.

546
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,872
First name Jamie.

547
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:40,048
Not gettin' anything.

548
01:00:42,638 --> 01:00:45,883
Wait. Got a hit on the
San Francisco database.

549
01:00:45,884 --> 01:00:46,850
You near a fax?

550
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:49,477
Yeah, uh...

551
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:55,566
Yes, send it to 212-555-0110.

552
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:58,316
Uh, Russo?
-That's right.

553
01:00:58,904 --> 01:01:01,146
Send you all we got.
-Thanks.

554
01:01:04,076 --> 01:01:06,567
<i>You have two unheard messages.</i>

555
01:01:06,662 --> 01:01:09,996
It's Petersen.
I heard you called in sick today.

556
01:01:10,082 --> 01:01:12,858
Just making sure you'll
wrap up Clancey tomorrow.

557
01:01:12,859 --> 01:01:14,411
Call me if you need anything.

558
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:20,090
Hi, this is Mr. Lewman, the Super.
I haven't forgotten about your pipe leak.

559
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:24,542
I'll have a look at it Wednesday evening.
I assume you'll still be at work,

560
01:01:24,638 --> 01:01:26,880
so I'll let myself in. Thanks.

561
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:29,099
<i>End of messages.</i>

562
01:01:35,524 --> 01:01:36,555
Hello?

563
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:39,517
Hello?

564
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:43,695
I'm just making sure you can
start Clute-Nichols on Wednesday.

565
01:01:43,782 --> 01:01:47,151
I want her back.
-Two more days, and she's all yours.

566
01:01:47,244 --> 01:01:49,320
No, not two days,
I want her back now.

567
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:53,490
What?
-Yeah, 'cause I know all about you.

568
01:01:54,835 --> 01:01:56,911
I know who you are,
Jamie Getz.

569
01:01:58,005 --> 01:02:01,041
I know all about
your best friend Rudolph Holloway,

570
01:02:01,133 --> 01:02:02,442
and where you come from

571
01:02:02,443 --> 01:02:05,345
and your days as a two-bit
hustler in San Francisco

572
01:02:05,429 --> 01:02:08,880
and three years at Avenal
for insurance fraud, arson.

573
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:12,389
How did you uh...

574
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:14,684
Doesn't matter.
What matters is what I know.

575
01:02:16,273 --> 01:02:19,227
Now I want her back,
unharmed...

576
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:23,735
or else I tell your pathetic story
to the cops. Do you understand?

577
01:02:24,865 --> 01:02:26,905
Well-played, Jonathan.

578
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:20,165
Mr. McQuarry, you have a phone call
from a Detective Russo. Line four.

579
01:03:23,924 --> 01:03:27,424
The body came in a little while ago.
She was found in a taxi.

580
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:29,653
The driver was in a coffee shop,

581
01:03:29,654 --> 01:03:31,961
came back and there she
was in the back seat.

582
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:36,841
And she fits the description you gave
us of that missing woman of yours.

583
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:42,148
And what's her name?
-Simone Wilkenson.

584
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:46,398
Let's go this way.

585
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,405
You want to step in,
Mr. McQuarry, please?

586
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:05,496
Okay.

587
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:20,848
Is this the woman you were with
the other night, Mr. McQuarry?

588
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,737
Mr. McQuarry?
-Yeah.

589
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:33,238
Have you seen this woman before?

590
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:36,571
No, I've never seen her before.

591
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:41,952
Who is she?
-She's a Wall Street analyst.

592
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:47,506
And... and what happened to her?
-She was strangled with something.

593
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:50,714
Coulda been wire, even a string.

594
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:55,090
Lab reports show traces of Kevlar
in the wound.

595
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:58,427
It's natural gut and Kevlar.
-Kevlar?

596
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:02,811
Kevlar?
-That should narrow it down for us.

597
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:08,478
You want to tell me anything else?

598
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:11,687
No.

599
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:43,496
Morning, Einstein.
Ready for your big day?

600
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:47,368
You know fuckin' shit.

601
01:06:48,212 --> 01:06:51,332
You think because you know
my name you know me.

602
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:55,001
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

603
01:06:56,303 --> 01:07:00,052
Yes, I do. You murdered Simone,
and you constantly try to set me up.

604
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:04,973
Not if you behave.
But if you screw with me today

605
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:09,516
what I did to her is kindness compared to
what I'll do to your little girlfriend.

606
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:14,229
Why, you won't even recognize her
when I'm through.

607
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,926
But her fate's in your hands.

608
01:07:16,927 --> 01:07:20,403
If you don't go through
with it, I'll kill her.

609
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:24,496
Yeah.
But if I do, you'll kill me.

610
01:07:25,457 --> 01:07:27,284
Yeah.
It's a bit tricky.

611
01:07:28,502 --> 01:07:29,622
But what do you care?

612
01:07:29,623 --> 01:07:32,714
You were dead long before I
met you, you just didn't know.

613
01:07:35,884 --> 01:07:37,960
You got no killer instinct,
Jonathan.

614
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:41,923
I'll give the instructions
to you later.

615
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:46,261
You've got until 6 p.m.
to execute them,

616
01:07:46,263 --> 01:07:47,430
or I execute her.

617
01:07:52,693 --> 01:07:56,311
Now, remember, be nice to
everybody on your first day at work.

618
01:07:57,489 --> 01:08:00,277
First impressions are everything,
don't you agree?

619
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:28,435
Mr. McQuarry. Follow me, please.
-Hello.

620
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:33,559
All of our C7 logs are on the system.

621
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:25,534
I just saw this in my in-box.
It's for you.

622
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:28,573
I guess it came in a little
while ago by messenger.

623
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:31,535
Thank you.

624
01:09:38,173 --> 01:09:41,459
Pay attention, Jonathan.
This is what you're gonna do.

625
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:45,086
Look for a group of sub-accounts
in the Liebling-Holloway Trust.

626
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:48,051
These are masked accounts.
48 separate line items

627
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:51,261
with IBAN numbers ending with 6700.

628
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:53,887
You bundle these phantom accounts

629
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:57,895
and set up a standard wire transfer
to the Banco Nationale, Madrid.

630
01:09:57,985 --> 01:10:00,820
An account's already been
set up in your name.

631
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:06,246
Clute-Nichols is
very particular about

632
01:10:06,247 --> 01:10:08,411
who accesses their
private holding accounts.

633
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:10,889
But you have a
level four clearance,

634
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:13,034
and that's why you're
my friend, remember?

635
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:21,583
At exactly 5 o'clock, you're gonna log
in and begin a global fund exchange.

636
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:25,967
Once you're inside, you're gonna
access the Liebling-Holloway Trust

637
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:28,131
through Rudolph Holloway's
private account.

638
01:10:29,224 --> 01:10:32,558
You'll only have 40 minutes to
locate the private trust accounts

639
01:10:32,644 --> 01:10:36,060
and manually consolidate all
balances into a single fund wire.

640
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:40,565
Once you're done, you'll encode this
fund wire for an end-of-day transfer

641
01:10:40,652 --> 01:10:42,728
to the Clute-Nichols
office in Hong Kong.

642
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,484
The Asian market
opens 15 hours ahead of us.

643
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:54,078
Thus, this transfer will be
catalogued as Friday's business

644
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:58,294
and won't flag on the Clute transfer
log until end of business Monday.

645
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:00,620
That's four days after
we're done, Jonathan.

646
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:05,627
That's plenty of time for me to
fill out a withdrawal slip in Spain.

647
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,559
Hello, sir.

648
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:28,658
Hey, Russo. Simone Wilkenson spent
the night at the Dylan two weeks ago.

649
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:32,736
The guy you like, McQuarry,
paid for the mini-bar in the room.

650
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,198
Let's go pick him up.

651
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,258
It's not coming out
of our pockets, is it?

652
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:38,682
What?

653
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:41,890
That delivery. You didn't bill it to us.
-No, of course not.

654
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:45,892
Good.
You guys charge enough as it is.

655
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:53,945
Is everything okay?
-Okay?

656
01:12:55,245 --> 01:12:58,579
With the audit.
-Yeah, yeah. It's fine.

657
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:02,122
I... it seems to be going very well.

658
01:13:08,842 --> 01:13:09,873
Good.

659
01:13:29,988 --> 01:13:32,314
It's not exactly a spectator sport.

660
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:40,407
Yeah, well,
I was gonna order in dinner anyway.

661
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:44,367
You want something?
-No, I'm fine, thank you.

662
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:02,611
Taxi!

663
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:48,953
Come on.

664
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:24,777
What happened?
-Probably a gas leak.

665
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:29,735
Which apartment?
-631. Jonathan McQuarry.

666
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:35,077
Is there a body?
-Coroner's already taken it away.

667
01:18:57,774 --> 01:19:00,941
We should be arriving
in Madrid by 6 a.m.

668
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:06,145
Excuse me, are you finished with that?

669
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:09,401
Please, go ahead.
-Thanks.

670
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:15,034
You on business?
-Yes, I am.

671
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:18,161
What do you do?
-I'm an accountant.

672
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:20,709
Do you like it?
-I love it.

673
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:23,837
Numbers know how to behave, right?
-Sure.

674
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:27,421
Order and symmetry.
What else could a man need?

675
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:30,052
Jim Winter.
Deutsche Bank.

676
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,780
Jonathan McQuarry, Worth and Berman.
Nice to meet you.

677
01:19:32,781 --> 01:19:33,260
Likewise.

678
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:24,777
What do you think?

679
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:34,288
You certainly look the part, Wyatt.

680
01:20:34,289 --> 01:20:35,159
Whoa, Wyatt?

681
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:38,700
Who's Wyatt? My name is...
-Hey. Don't.

682
01:20:39,459 --> 01:20:41,535
Yeah, the rules.
No names, huh?

683
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:45,125
That's a nice suit.
-When did you get in?

684
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:47,291
Couple of days ago.
-Two days, huh?

685
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:52,550
Been enjoying Madrid?
-Been jet-lagged.

686
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:55,548
We need champagne.
You want to order some?

687
01:20:55,549 --> 01:20:56,716
No, I'm fine with this.

688
01:20:56,810 --> 01:21:00,345
Then give me a beer.
Holy shit, look at this.

689
01:21:01,398 --> 01:21:05,526
Wow. I spoke to Mr. Ruiz
at Banco Nacional de San Sebastian.

690
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,232
He's ready for us whenever we want.

691
01:21:08,233 --> 01:21:10,229
You're about to be a
millionairess, baby.

692
01:21:11,033 --> 01:21:13,109
How about that?
Little ol' you, huh?

693
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:16,143
From the corner of the
street and here you are,

694
01:21:16,144 --> 01:21:17,492
to the biggest double suite.

695
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:21,784
Who's always looking out for you?

696
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:26,459
Oh, yeah. Suits and ties,
I told you, they're the big game.

697
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:32,090
Hey. I'm paying you a million bucks
for services rendered.

698
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:36,681
What the fuck is wrong with you?
-Nothing. Christ, I'm jet-lagged.

699
01:21:37,601 --> 01:21:38,845
I do so hate to be crass,

700
01:21:38,846 --> 01:21:41,184
but you don't have "No,
thank you" rights here.

701
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:43,931
You don't have
to tell me that twice.

702
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:50,652
So, how did it go?
Everything okay?

703
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:53,647
Perfect.
You did a great job on him.

704
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:58,030
Yeah, that poor bastard
was practically in love with you.

705
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:04,704
He said that?
-He didn't need to say it.

706
01:22:08,548 --> 01:22:11,715
So, he just transferred the money,
no questions?

707
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:13,322
Sure, he had questions.

708
01:22:13,323 --> 01:22:16,298
He said he would only
do it if you were safe.

709
01:22:18,308 --> 01:22:19,886
What about him?

710
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:25,138
Is he safe?
-Well, he had a little accident.

711
01:22:37,995 --> 01:22:40,071
What?
-The old routine.

712
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:56,127
You killed him?
-It was an accident.

713
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:58,178
You fucking killed him?

714
01:23:00,517 --> 01:23:02,675
You fucking piece of shit.

715
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:05,225
You fucking lousy... lousy...

716
01:23:06,189 --> 01:23:10,602
He knew my name.
Jesus Christ, why do you care?

717
01:23:11,361 --> 01:23:13,587
How long do you think he
would've waited for you to show

718
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:14,564
before he called the cops?

719
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:16,981
One hour? Three?
I had no choice.

720
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:20,111
Alright?
He would've found me.

721
01:23:34,718 --> 01:23:36,260
Jesus Christ.

722
01:23:38,055 --> 01:23:40,131
You were into the accountant.

723
01:23:41,892 --> 01:23:43,434
You for real?

724
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:51,901
That was stupid.

725
01:23:55,947 --> 01:23:56,979
Fuck.

726
01:24:05,332 --> 01:24:06,874
I'm sorry.

727
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:10,920
I'm sorry.

728
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:15,919
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

729
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:21,503
It just caught me by surprise.

730
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:28,847
You'll feel fine later
with all that cash. Trust me.

731
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,976
Buy you a nice
leather bag to put it in.

732
01:24:37,197 --> 01:24:41,610
We'll take the night train to Paris.
Have some fois gras at Le Bouclard...

733
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:48,205
then mosey on down to Nice.
Work on our tans.

734
01:24:49,668 --> 01:24:53,831
Buy a yacht.
We can name it Jonathan.

735
01:24:57,509 --> 01:25:02,550
My baby loves me,
she always makes me feel fine.

736
01:25:02,806 --> 01:25:06,506
She loves me,
she lets me know that she's mine.

737
01:25:06,685 --> 01:25:08,393
And when she kisses...

738
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:12,846
And then I ask her
if everything is okay,

739
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:16,934
I get my answer,
the only thing I can say,

740
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:19,734
I say "Yeah, yeah."
Your turn.

741
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:28,654
Say it!
-Yeah, yeah...

742
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:31,828
is what I say.

743
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:35,162
Oh, what I'm gonna do to you.

744
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:45,223
I have an appointment
with Mr. Ruiz. Ruiz?

745
01:26:45,224 --> 01:26:46,280
Ruiz, that's right.

746
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:49,986
Ruiz. I'm Jonathan McQuarry.
-I was told to expect you. One moment.

747
01:26:55,335 --> 01:26:56,366
McQuarry.

748
01:26:57,337 --> 01:26:59,197
Okay, this way.
Excuse me.

749
01:26:59,198 --> 01:27:02,129
The young lady,
she's also on the account?

750
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:06,251
No. She's my personal secretary.
-I see.

751
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:10,715
Well, only those on the account
are permitted in Mr. Ruiz' offices.

752
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:12,433
I do apologize.

753
01:27:12,519 --> 01:27:15,639
Would you mind if I waited here?
-Wait here if you like.

754
01:27:18,984 --> 01:27:20,526
This way, please.

755
01:27:31,413 --> 01:27:35,078
Mr. Lopez-Poline, our Bank Manager.
He will take care of you now.

756
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:37,836
Mr. McQuarry. Buenas dias.
-Buenas dias.

757
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:41,833
I understand you wish to close
your account with us today.

758
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:44,710
I'm afraid so.
I require some extra liquidity.

759
01:27:44,801 --> 01:27:46,750
Of course.
I need to see your passport

760
01:27:46,751 --> 01:27:48,799
and you will need to
sign a few documents.

761
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:51,140
Here you are.

762
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:07,816
Gracias.
-Gracias.

763
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:12,197
And tell me, will the co-signer
be joining us shortly?

764
01:28:13,371 --> 01:28:16,041
Excuse me?
-The co-signer on this account.

765
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:19,458
We will need his information as well
before we can release the funds.

766
01:28:22,088 --> 01:28:24,414
The co-signer.
-Yes, sir.

767
01:28:24,508 --> 01:28:28,422
When this money was transferred
there was a request for a co-signature

768
01:28:28,512 --> 01:28:31,429
to release the funds.
I have it right here.

769
01:28:34,476 --> 01:28:38,805
A Mr. Bose, Wyatt Bose,
is listed on the account as well.

770
01:28:39,773 --> 01:28:43,023
Wyatt Bose.
-Yes, Mr. McQuarry.

771
01:28:44,528 --> 01:28:46,651
According to our records

772
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:50,189
you yourself requested the co-signature
when you transferred these funds.

773
01:28:50,867 --> 01:28:54,616
Yes, I know I did, but it's just...

774
01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:01,831
It's not a problem.
I can sort this out.

775
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:08,625
Please tell Mr. Ruiz
I'll be back shortly.

776
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:11,630
Okay.

777
01:29:44,754 --> 01:29:46,830
Hello.
-Are you free tonight?

778
01:29:48,675 --> 01:29:51,593
Jonathan.
-I said, are you free tonight?

779
01:29:53,847 --> 01:29:55,389
Yes, I am.

780
01:30:07,277 --> 01:30:08,819
Hello, Jonathan.

781
01:30:16,453 --> 01:30:18,611
My God,
I'm a handsome devil.

782
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:23,664
The hair isn't quite right.
You losing some on top, there?

783
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:27,372
Regardless, you look well.
-For someone you thought you'd killed.

784
01:30:29,633 --> 01:30:31,341
I want half.

785
01:30:33,011 --> 01:30:36,345
Careful. The suit doesn't make
the man, Jonathan.

786
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:39,885
I stole 20 million dollars.
I figure I'm entitled to some of it.

787
01:30:42,062 --> 01:30:45,181
There are two signatures required
to release those funds.

788
01:30:47,734 --> 01:30:49,810
You thought of everything,
didn't you?

789
01:30:50,695 --> 01:30:54,693
Without me that money doesn't
move anywhere. I want half.

790
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:01,622
Okay.
Let's do it.

791
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:12,589
Seor Bose.
-Thank you.

792
01:31:12,676 --> 01:31:14,170
Seor McQuarry.

793
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:24,136
Would you sign there,
Mr. McQuarry, please?

794
01:31:30,819 --> 01:31:34,270
Two suitcases,
ten million each.

795
01:31:35,782 --> 01:31:38,818
Well, everything
seems to be in order.

796
01:31:39,452 --> 01:31:42,026
Mr. McQuarry, Mr. Bose...

797
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:45,746
please sign here and here.

798
01:31:47,877 --> 01:31:50,997
Thank you.
Please follow me.

799
01:31:58,263 --> 01:31:59,757
All yours.

800
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:23,245
Well, here we are, Jonathan.
Spain, a suitcase full of money.

801
01:32:24,706 --> 01:32:27,826
A lot of people would give everything
to feel what we're feeling right now.

802
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:31,704
I'm curious.
How did you know you'd been played?

803
01:32:33,006 --> 01:32:35,497
You made a mistake.
-I made a mistake?

804
01:32:36,176 --> 01:32:39,296
The photo you sent me
was taken a few weeks ago.

805
01:32:40,055 --> 01:32:42,131
Before the pipe behind her
caused the stain.

806
01:32:46,478 --> 01:32:50,807
I knew she was in on it.
-No longer. She took off.

807
01:32:53,318 --> 01:32:54,860
Where is she?

808
01:32:55,695 --> 01:32:58,067
She really got under your skin,
didn't she?

809
01:33:01,034 --> 01:33:04,154
I'll give you half my share
if you tell me where she is.

810
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:05,871
Is that so?

811
01:33:09,668 --> 01:33:11,956
Let's go somewhere
quiet and make a deal.

812
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:19,425
She fell for you, Jonathan.
It's true.

813
01:33:21,972 --> 01:33:24,048
I think she may
have even loved you.

814
01:33:27,769 --> 01:33:31,387
She's a very special girl, and I think
she's worth more than half your share,

815
01:33:31,481 --> 01:33:33,390
but then again...

816
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:09,556
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

817
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:26,338
Wait! Wait! I need to talk to you.
-No. Get out of here, Jonathan.

818
01:35:26,429 --> 01:35:28,508
I came here hoping I
would see you again.

819
01:35:28,509 --> 01:35:29,845
You know nothing about me.

820
01:35:29,933 --> 01:35:32,009
You don't even know my name.

821
01:35:32,936 --> 01:35:36,056
So I was just part of the plan,
is that it? Everything.

822
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:40,689
I wanted to call it off.
That night in Chinatown.

823
01:35:41,444 --> 01:35:44,217
I didn't know he was gonna
try to kill you. I'm so sorry.

824
01:35:44,218 --> 01:35:44,694
Don't go.

825
01:35:50,245 --> 01:35:52,072
Take care of yourself.

826
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,369
Norbert Lewman... the Super.

827
