1
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,960
<i>0900.</i>

2
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,320
<i>In a few short hours,
I was going into combat...</i>

3
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,161
<i>...against my own children.</i>

4
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,081
<i>Anyone who has a child
knows what I'm talking about.</i>

5
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,040
<i>That's the real war:
Our generation against theirs.</i>

6
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:47,042
<i>Standing on that deck,
surrounded by thousands of men...</i>

7
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:52,040
<i>...I suddenly felt smaller and lonelier
than I'd ever felt in my life.</i>

8
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:55,162
<i>I'd been through this same Golden Gate
when Frances had died...</i>

9
00:02:55,322 --> 00:02:57,643
<i>...and I'd come home
on emergency leave.</i>

10
00:02:57,801 --> 00:02:59,921
<i>Now I was back for good.</i>

11
00:03:00,081 --> 00:03:02,402
<i>I'd left more than my heart
in San Francisco:</i>

12
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:04,483
<i>Ten children, to be exact.</i>

13
00:03:05,361 --> 00:03:09,043
<i>As we sailed under that bridge, I didn't
know I was passing under my future...</i>

14
00:03:09,201 --> 00:03:11,723
<i>...because while I was going home
to face my family...</i>

15
00:03:11,923 --> 00:03:14,804
<i>...Helen was bringing hers
to a new life in a new city.</i>

16
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:16,763
<i>And don't think I wasn't frightened.</i>

17
00:03:16,923 --> 00:03:18,443
<i>I had become a Navy widow.</i>

18
00:03:18,644 --> 00:03:21,364
<i>I thought it was a good idea
to get a fresh start...</i>

19
00:03:21,524 --> 00:03:24,002
<i>...where the surroundings
wouldn't remind me of Dick.</i>

20
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,403
<i>But four of my surroundings
looked exactly like him.</i>

21
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:29,283
<i>What troubled me more
than anything...</i>

22
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:32,924
<i>...was the kids seemed more upset
about leaving their friends in Seattle...</i>

23
00:03:33,084 --> 00:03:34,805
<i>...than by the loss of their father.</i>

24
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:38,324
<i>It took me a long time to learn
how little I knew about children...</i>

25
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,484
<i>...especially my own.</i>

26
00:03:40,685 --> 00:03:43,484
<i>As the ship sailed into the bay,
I took a good look around...</i>

27
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:46,324
<i>...because I knew I'd completed
my last tour aboard her.</i>

28
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:49,204
<i>My brother and his wife
had been taking care of my kids...</i>

29
00:03:49,405 --> 00:03:51,566
<i>...but now it was Daddy's turn.</i>

30
00:03:54,204 --> 00:03:56,605
<i>So I started down the gangplank...</i>

31
00:03:56,805 --> 00:03:58,805
<i>...certain I was doing the right thing...</i>

32
00:03:58,966 --> 00:04:01,645
<i>...nobly sacrificing myself
for my children...</i>

33
00:04:02,086 --> 00:04:04,445
<i>...giving up my world for theirs.</i>

34
00:04:04,605 --> 00:04:08,687
<i>Pulling away forever from ships
and oceans and homecomings...</i>

35
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:10,526
<i>...to take up shore duty.</i>

36
00:04:10,686 --> 00:04:12,445
<i>Papa came marching home...</i>

37
00:04:12,605 --> 00:04:14,847
<i>...secure in the knowledge
that they needed me...</i>

38
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:17,807
<i>...and would be overjoyed
I'd come back to take care of them.</i>

39
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,966
<i>But they controlled
their feelings beautifully.</i>

40
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,807
<i>It was the sort of welcome
that could make any father...</i>

41
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:27,687
<i>...review his position on
the entire question of birth control.</i>

42
00:04:27,846 --> 00:04:30,088
<i>Incredible as it may sound,
they blame me...</i>

43
00:04:30,247 --> 00:04:32,567
<i>...for neglecting their mother
all those years.</i>

44
00:04:32,726 --> 00:04:35,408
<i>But it seemed to me
there was enough physical evidence...</i>

45
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:38,247
<i>...that I hadn't
neglected her completely.</i>

46
00:04:38,447 --> 00:04:41,848
<i>What they really couldn't understand
was why I was allowing my brother...</i>

47
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:45,487
<i>...and his wife to take Germaine
and Joan away from the family.</i>

48
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:50,449
Here you go, baby.
Come on, come with Uncle Howard.

49
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:55,168
Oh, you couldn't take care of
two little babies, Frank. Not yet.

50
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:57,329
They'll be happier with us for a while.

51
00:04:57,488 --> 00:04:59,970
I hope you can learn
to manage the rest.

52
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:02,769
You've hardly been home long enough
to learn their names.

53
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:06,050
I'm home now. I'll manage.
Don't you worry.

54
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:11,170
Goodbye, pumpkin. Bye, baby.
Don't give them any trouble.

55
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:13,089
If you live through this...

56
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,170
...the Navy's going to have to get
a new kind of medal for you.

57
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:19,089
- Good luck, Frank.
- Good luck. You're gonna need it.

58
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,529
- Goodbye, Joan. Goodbye, Germaine.
- Goodbye.

59
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:32,932
Well, let's get something to eat.

60
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,011
They're not going to an orphanage,
you know.

61
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,692
They'll be half a mile away.
You can see them any time.

62
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:43,132
Susan, Louise, come on.

63
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:45,932
It's only until I get things
straightened out here.

64
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:49,172
And then what? You planning on
auctioning off the rest of us?

65
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:52,692
Where would I find a bidder? Come on,
in the kitchen. Let's get dinner.

66
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:55,653
Which one of us do you wanna cook?

67
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:05,213
The war was on.

68
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:08,773
<i>I put an ad in the paper
for a housekeeper that brought results.</i>

69
00:06:08,932 --> 00:06:11,252
<i>The first one lasted an entire day.</i>

70
00:06:23,814 --> 00:06:25,774
<i>The second one lasted seven days.</i>

71
00:06:25,934 --> 00:06:28,334
<i>We discovered she was hiding
from the police.</i>

72
00:06:28,694 --> 00:06:31,774
<i>After a week with us,
she turned herself in.</i>

73
00:06:39,735 --> 00:06:41,975
<i>No wonder men go down
to the sea in ships.</i>

74
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:45,095
<i>I'd have gone back in a life raft.</i>

75
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,255
<i>I had rented an ideal house
close to the Navy base...</i>

76
00:06:49,415 --> 00:06:52,615
<i>...so I could work part-time
in the dispensary, close to the school...</i>

77
00:06:52,776 --> 00:06:57,096
<i>...close to the playground and a little
too close to the boy next door.</i>

78
00:07:01,016 --> 00:07:03,096
<i>I was broad-minded about it, though.</i>

79
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,297
<i>I was gonna give that boy
two more seconds...</i>

80
00:07:05,456 --> 00:07:08,297
<i>...before I went out there
and broke it up.</i>

81
00:07:10,937 --> 00:07:14,257
I hate ants. I hate ants. I hate ants!

82
00:07:14,896 --> 00:07:17,737
Come on, this is really stupid.

83
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:21,456
Listen, what are you doing? What
are you...? You hate ants. Never mind.

84
00:07:21,617 --> 00:07:22,976
Now, that belongs to her.

85
00:07:23,137 --> 00:07:26,377
What is the matter with you?
You've been acting like this all week.

86
00:07:26,577 --> 00:07:29,538
Mother, how's a person
supposed to hear?

87
00:07:29,697 --> 00:07:33,377
Colleen, I'd like to know what's going
on between you and that boy.

88
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:36,098
And I don't care if he does look like
Paul Newman.

89
00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:38,737
- Is the spanking over?
- No, it is not over.

90
00:07:38,898 --> 00:07:40,658
Listen, what's gotten into you lately?

91
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:43,218
Where is that good little boy
that used to live here?

92
00:07:43,418 --> 00:07:46,259
I'll never be a good boy again.
I'm never gonna be good.

93
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:48,418
I don't wanna die.

94
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:50,379
What are you talking about?

95
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:54,538
Nicky told me that the good die young,
and that's why Daddy died.

96
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:59,860
You can hit me and you can hit me,
but I'll never be a good boy again.

97
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,300
<i>Funny. Beginning
of the school year...</i>

98
00:08:05,461 --> 00:08:07,180
<i>...had never been a problem
to Frances.</i>

99
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:09,980
<i>The girls passed their dresses down
from one to another...</i>

100
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,380
<i>...and it all sort of came out even.</i>

101
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,380
<i>Have you ever been 5 years old
and forced to appear in public...</i>

102
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:27,502
<i>...in a dress that had three former
owners, restyled by an old sail maker?</i>

103
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:31,221
<i>Five years old and no future at all.</i>

104
00:09:18,344 --> 00:09:23,225
<i>And then one day, Frank and I just
happened to run into each other.</i>

105
00:09:30,065 --> 00:09:34,144
<i>I'd been wrapped up in my children
for so long that getting this close...</i>

106
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:39,786
<i>...to an attractive woman set my
early warning radar pulsing frantically.</i>

107
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:45,265
<i>I was glad to have a reason
for a second look myself.</i>

108
00:09:49,986 --> 00:09:51,746
You requisition those Fresnel lenses?

109
00:09:51,907 --> 00:09:54,986
I'll answer that tomorrow.
The working day has ceased.

110
00:09:55,147 --> 00:09:57,626
Just starting for me.
Drop me at the house.

111
00:09:57,787 --> 00:10:00,067
Frank, do you realise
that at this very hour...

112
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:03,226
...the Officers' Club is jam-packed
with two-legged goodies.

113
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:05,947
We owe it to our brethren at sea
to do unto others...

114
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,067
...as they would
if they had our chance.

115
00:10:12,187 --> 00:10:14,028
Darrell, it may come as a shock...

116
00:10:14,187 --> 00:10:16,388
...but there are other things
besides girls.

117
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:18,467
Yeah, women.

118
00:10:18,628 --> 00:10:20,548
Now, don't tell me
it isn't on your mind.

119
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:24,548
Any fella who has 10 children
just doesn't quit cold turkey.

120
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,587
And if you'd only just...

121
00:10:27,748 --> 00:10:30,989
Why don't you watch where you're...
Oh, hello.

122
00:10:31,188 --> 00:10:32,588
Hi.

123
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:36,788
Well, old Sam the hermit gets out
of the cave once in a while, huh?

124
00:10:36,948 --> 00:10:40,029
She had my Cream of Wheat
and I had her Post Toasties.

125
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,509
- What?
- Saw her at the commissary, that's all.

126
00:10:43,668 --> 00:10:44,990
Frank, what's wrong with you?

127
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:47,269
You gonna be an old maid
the rest of your life?

128
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:49,909
You really think that's what Frances
would've wanted?

129
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,870
Probably not, but give me time.

130
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:54,750
Time?
You're a borderline case already.

131
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:57,789
You may only have a few more
cruises left in you.

132
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:07,750
- Come on in. I'll buy you a beer.
- I thought you'd never ask me.

133
00:11:09,552 --> 00:11:12,030
You can stop worrying about me.
Things are looking up.

134
00:11:12,191 --> 00:11:15,750
I finally found a housekeeper
who seems to have staying power.

135
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,831
Soon I'll ask you to loan me
your little black book, but right now...

136
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:21,991
Where you going, Mrs. Anderson?

137
00:11:22,152 --> 00:11:23,991
Mrs. Anderson was last week.

138
00:11:24,152 --> 00:11:28,231
I'm Mrs. Ferguson,
and you can mail me my check.

139
00:11:28,511 --> 00:11:31,032
She left her broomstick.

140
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:37,913
All right, what happened this time?

141
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,673
Who did what to Mrs. Ferguson?

142
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:42,993
All right, one at a time.
One at a time.

143
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:45,193
- She and Louise had a fight.
- A bad fight.

144
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:48,073
Louise wouldn't come out
of the bathroom for an hour.

145
00:11:48,273 --> 00:11:50,274
She went in, and they were yelling.

146
00:11:50,432 --> 00:11:52,953
- Is that strawberry jam on your hands?
- Raspberry.

147
00:11:53,153 --> 00:11:56,072
I guess she started shaking her...
Or she slipped on the soap.

148
00:11:56,234 --> 00:11:59,313
- Anyway, she fell.
- She didn't fall, she fainted...

149
00:11:59,474 --> 00:12:01,033
...right on the floor.

150
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:04,874
When Mrs. Ferguson came out, I was
kind of mad, and I had to push her.

151
00:12:07,715 --> 00:12:10,554
Wait a minute. Hold it!
Louise fainted? Where is she?

152
00:12:10,715 --> 00:12:12,955
She's in her room crying,
and she won't come out.

153
00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:14,434
We tried.

154
00:12:16,674 --> 00:12:18,835
I think she's dying.

155
00:12:18,995 --> 00:12:21,914
- And what have you been playing with?
- Ink.

156
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:23,875
Indelible.

157
00:12:25,676 --> 00:12:27,475
Louise.

158
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,916
Louise, what in the world happened
between you and Mrs. Ferguson?

159
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:33,196
I don't wanna talk about it.
Leave me alone.

160
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:35,355
Mary said you fainted.
Is something wrong?

161
00:12:35,515 --> 00:12:39,116
No. I just wish I could get out of this
house and drown myself, that's all.

162
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:41,157
At least I'd be alone.

163
00:12:41,317 --> 00:12:44,037
Let me take you to the dispensary,
have them check you out.

164
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:47,437
No. I don't wanna see any doctors,
and I don't want them to see me!

165
00:12:47,596 --> 00:12:50,238
- But, Louise...
- No, please. I don't want to.

166
00:12:50,397 --> 00:12:52,876
No, stop it! I don't want to.

167
00:12:53,037 --> 00:12:56,716
No, put me down!
I don't wanna go, please.

168
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,837
Stop it, I don't want to.

169
00:13:04,878 --> 00:13:06,957
Mr. Beardsley?

170
00:13:07,197 --> 00:13:08,638
- How is she?
- Oh, she's fine.

171
00:13:08,798 --> 00:13:10,717
Nothing to worry about.
May I talk to you?

172
00:13:12,318 --> 00:13:13,758
Privately.

173
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,438
I forgot my Post Toasties.

174
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:22,958
We've scarcely met, but I feel
that I must talk to you about this.

175
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,399
Of course.

176
00:13:24,558 --> 00:13:26,599
Your daughter tells me
that you're a widower?

177
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,438
Yes, that's right.

178
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:31,240
I'm awfully sorry.

179
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:35,519
Louise seems to feel the loss
of her mother very deeply.

180
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:40,559
On top of that, she's going through
a very trying time emotionally.

181
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:43,360
I don't quite understand.
Am I being stupid?

182
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,279
No, you're being a man,
which is sometimes the same thing.

183
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,360
You can learn to do
the shopping for the family...

184
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:55,240
...and maybe even do the dishes...

185
00:13:57,201 --> 00:13:59,880
...but that doesn't exactly
make you a mother.

186
00:14:00,042 --> 00:14:02,802
Well, I'm not really cut out for the job.

187
00:14:02,961 --> 00:14:07,682
Well, it seems that it's not been easy...

188
00:14:07,841 --> 00:14:10,282
...for Louise to explain to you that...

189
00:14:14,682 --> 00:14:16,961
You know...

190
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:20,763
...a tree can blossom in the middle
of a busy city...

191
00:14:20,922 --> 00:14:22,841
...but a young girl needs privacy...

192
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,802
...and she hasn't been able
to find it at home.

193
00:14:26,043 --> 00:14:29,961
So if she's been emotional or upset
or even a little bit hysterical...

194
00:14:30,123 --> 00:14:34,962
...it's because she's growing up
and suddenly changing.

195
00:14:36,082 --> 00:14:38,323
Is that all? Why didn't she tell me?

196
00:14:38,563 --> 00:14:40,962
Because you would've said,
" Is that all?"

197
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:43,884
She said that she's been very upset...

198
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:47,644
...about having to share
her room at home, and...

199
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,604
Today, when the maid walked in
while she was taking a bath...

200
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,764
...she was so embarrassed that she...
- Poor Louise.

201
00:14:53,924 --> 00:14:56,524
Stopped being a little girl,
and I never noticed.

202
00:14:56,684 --> 00:15:00,764
Well, if it's any help, I understand.

203
00:15:01,004 --> 00:15:04,325
I'm a widow, and I have
the same problem in reverse.

204
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:07,806
Now I'm sorry.
Have you been alone very long?

205
00:15:08,884 --> 00:15:11,086
Forever.

206
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:12,605
Almost a year now.

207
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,525
I know what you mean.

208
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:20,206
Dick was a navigator.
He crashed, routine training flight.

209
00:15:20,725 --> 00:15:23,446
- Navy?
- What else is there?

210
00:15:23,605 --> 00:15:26,886
Children?
They say it's toughest on the kids...

211
00:15:27,046 --> 00:15:30,765
...but they haven't convinced me.
- I know.

212
00:15:31,366 --> 00:15:33,167
And right now I think you have...

213
00:15:33,326 --> 00:15:35,886
...a rather difficult assignment
with your daughter.

214
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:38,767
I think you should go in
and talk to her and take her home.

215
00:15:39,687 --> 00:15:41,246
Thank you, Mrs?

216
00:15:41,527 --> 00:15:43,126
North. Helen.

217
00:15:44,168 --> 00:15:45,606
Thank you, North Helen.

218
00:15:47,288 --> 00:15:50,607
- When are you on duty here?
- Afternoons. Five days a week.

219
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:54,606
Any of my kids get sick on
the weekend, I'll hold them over.

220
00:16:02,768 --> 00:16:04,729
Hi.

221
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:07,288
- How do you feel?
- I'm fine.

222
00:16:07,448 --> 00:16:10,328
- Can I go home now?
- Sure.

223
00:16:11,249 --> 00:16:13,328
Turn around.

224
00:17:45,213 --> 00:17:48,535
- Hello.
- Oh, is this North Helen?

225
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:53,775
- Yes. Who is this?
- This is Frank Beardsley.

226
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:56,375
Oh, are you having more problems?

227
00:17:56,536 --> 00:18:01,134
No, no. I just called to thank you for
helping me with my daughter today.

228
00:18:01,295 --> 00:18:04,694
Well, now, that's the worst reason
I ever heard...

229
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:07,815
...for calling a woman
at 11:00 at night.

230
00:18:07,976 --> 00:18:10,615
Well, I'm a little out of practise.

231
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:14,056
Well, as a matter of fact, so am I.

232
00:18:14,777 --> 00:18:17,336
Oh, for heaven's sake,
ask her out to dinner.

233
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:18,776
Who's that?

234
00:18:18,935 --> 00:18:22,176
- What are you doing on this phone?
- I have to make an important call...

235
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:25,176
...and he gets off duty
at the taco stand at 11: 15.

236
00:18:25,336 --> 00:18:27,896
Colleen, hang up.

237
00:18:28,616 --> 00:18:30,176
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

238
00:18:30,336 --> 00:18:32,537
I could never have done it
without her.

239
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:35,897
How about dinner? Tomorrow night.

240
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:38,257
Well...

241
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,377
Mother, it's 11: 14.

242
00:18:40,538 --> 00:18:42,298
What time would you like
to pick me up?

243
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,298
- About 1900?
- Aye, aye, sir.

244
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,498
- Good night, Helen.
- Good night, Frank.

245
00:18:46,657 --> 00:18:48,378
Good night, Colleen.

246
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:57,098
Mother, don't blink.
You've got to let the glue dry.

247
00:18:57,259 --> 00:19:00,459
But I look ridiculous
with all this goop on my eyes.

248
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:03,179
- Mommy, you're beautiful.
- You sure are.

249
00:19:03,338 --> 00:19:06,900
Thank you, but is it necessary
that I wear these eyelashes?

250
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:08,778
I got your father without them.

251
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,219
- But you were younger then.
- Yeah.

252
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,618
- Here. Here goes the other side.
- Hold steady.

253
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,180
Okay, let me take it now.

254
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:20,059
- Mother.
- What?

255
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,461
Is he handsome?
I mean, in an old sort of way.

256
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:27,380
- Gee, I can hardly wait to meet him.
- Me too.

257
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:31,779
Let's not overwhelm him with family.
Not the first date, huh?

258
00:19:31,941 --> 00:19:35,461
- You mean he doesn't know about us?
- Of course he does, darling.

259
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:37,820
All of us?

260
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:40,540
Mother, that's so romantic.

261
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:43,501
- You lied to him.
- I did not lie to him.

262
00:19:43,662 --> 00:19:46,300
I just didn't have the nerve
to tell him the whole truth.

263
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:51,500
I understand. No man wants a liaison
with a woman with eight children.

264
00:19:51,662 --> 00:19:53,902
- What's a liaison?
- An affair.

265
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:56,382
- That's what I thought.
- Me too.

266
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,781
I am not having an affair,
and I'm not having a liaison.

267
00:19:59,942 --> 00:20:01,222
I'm merely going to dinner.

268
00:20:01,382 --> 00:20:02,982
As soon as I tell him about you...

269
00:20:03,143 --> 00:20:06,383
...he'll bring me home
in plenty of time for dessert.

270
00:20:12,182 --> 00:20:14,262
Mike, see that it's lights out
by 10:00.

271
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:17,222
- Ten o'clock?
- We're back in kindergarten?

272
00:20:17,423 --> 00:20:20,903
- They stay up later in prison.
- Would you like to move?

273
00:20:21,064 --> 00:20:22,782
When you finish with the slot cars...

274
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:24,903
...spend 10 minutes
with your geometry book.

275
00:20:25,064 --> 00:20:26,343
Flowers, Pop?

276
00:20:26,544 --> 00:20:30,104
Is that corny. How do you expect
to make any time with that approach?

277
00:20:30,305 --> 00:20:33,344
We are just going to dinner.
It isn't going to be a love- in.

278
00:20:33,544 --> 00:20:35,983
- You can say that again.
- No such luck.

279
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:38,703
Did you tell the lady
you have 10 little children...

280
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:42,224
...two of them given away?
- You bet he didn't.

281
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:45,144
He'll hand her those flowers,
then give her a snow job...

282
00:20:45,305 --> 00:20:50,105
...on how lonely it is here at home.
- You listen to me.

283
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:53,505
Every time in the last year that I've
dared take a woman to dinner...

284
00:20:53,664 --> 00:20:56,384
...or been reckless enough
to bring her home to meet you...

285
00:20:56,545 --> 00:20:59,865
...you've done all you could to make
her unwelcome. Well, I've had it.

286
00:21:00,105 --> 00:21:02,425
I'm doing all I can for you,
little as that is...

287
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:04,746
...I think I deserve
some consideration.

288
00:21:04,905 --> 00:21:07,067
I suppose I'm being unfair.
Who did this?

289
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:10,346
My generation is the givers,
your generation, the takers.

290
00:21:10,506 --> 00:21:13,546
Well, it's time to strike a blow
for freedom.

291
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:16,426
From now on,
I intend to think of myself first.

292
00:21:16,586 --> 00:21:19,186
If this be treason,
make the most of it.

293
00:21:19,426 --> 00:21:23,227
- But are you gonna tell her?
- Yes, I'm going to tell her.

294
00:21:27,188 --> 00:21:29,228
You're gonna be a knockout
tonight, Mom.

295
00:21:29,387 --> 00:21:33,067
- Yeah, Mom, you're beautiful.
- Thank you, darling.

296
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:36,147
Good heavens,
what did you do to this dress?

297
00:21:36,307 --> 00:21:38,667
Mother,
it was practically an antique.

298
00:21:38,827 --> 00:21:40,427
We just shortened it a little.

299
00:21:40,587 --> 00:21:45,107
- A little? I look like a teenybopper.
- Well, what's wrong with that?

300
00:21:45,268 --> 00:21:47,229
- I can't go out in this.
- Why not?

301
00:21:47,388 --> 00:21:49,067
Your legs are better than mine.

302
00:21:49,229 --> 00:21:52,348
It'll be okay as soon as we shorten
the slip. Give me those pins.

303
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:54,469
Oh, heavens. Jean, run downstairs...

304
00:21:54,628 --> 00:21:57,709
...and tell Tommy to whistle
the minute he sees Mr. Beardsley.

305
00:21:57,868 --> 00:21:59,909
- But I wanna watch.
- Please, Jean.

306
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,909
- The minute he sees Mr. Beardsley.
- Will you stand still?

307
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:04,789
You'll get this pin stuck in you.

308
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,749
I'm put together with pins and glue.

309
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,750
If there's a strong wind,
I'm in trouble.

310
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:13,230
- There he is. Hurry up. Hurry up.
- He's coming!

311
00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:16,150
- Look at him.
- Wow, look at that car!

312
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,309
- He's in the Navy.
- Look at that jacket.

313
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,070
Look at those stripes.
He's got flowers for Mom.

314
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:25,191
- Yeah, blue eyes.
- Boy, I bet you that guy's rich.

315
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,750
- All right.
- No!

316
00:22:29,912 --> 00:22:31,391
- Pass it on.
- The door.

317
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:32,830
Get away from the door.

318
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:38,431
Get away from that door. Get away.
Get back. Get back.

319
00:22:41,871 --> 00:22:43,230
- Hello there.
- Hello.

320
00:22:43,392 --> 00:22:46,392
Well, we better hurry. I know
how you like to get places on time.

321
00:22:46,551 --> 00:22:48,352
- I do?
- Yeah. Where are we going?

322
00:22:48,511 --> 00:22:50,912
San Francisco. Little place...
I brought you flowers.

323
00:22:51,072 --> 00:22:53,192
Thank you.
Why, they're beautiful.

324
00:22:53,353 --> 00:22:55,552
Shouldn't you put them in the house,
in water?

325
00:22:55,711 --> 00:22:58,792
Of course.
I don't know what I was thinking.

326
00:23:01,032 --> 00:23:02,913
They're my favourite.

327
00:23:03,073 --> 00:23:05,433
Beautiful night, isn't it?

328
00:23:06,394 --> 00:23:08,393
<i>I had a wonderful time at dinner.</i>

329
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,794
<i>I didn't know whether it was the food
or Frank...</i>

330
00:23:10,952 --> 00:23:13,272
<i>...or the fact that I didn't have
to do the dishes.</i>

331
00:23:13,432 --> 00:23:16,432
<i>I couldn't stop talking. I told her
about Frances, the Navy...</i>

332
00:23:16,594 --> 00:23:19,554
<i>...about the new carrier
landing system I was working on.</i>

333
00:23:19,714 --> 00:23:22,233
<i>I told her about everything
but the children.</i>

334
00:23:22,394 --> 00:23:24,993
<i>Funny how that never came up.</i>

335
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:29,275
<i>I guess I figured it would be easier
over an Irish coffee.</i>

336
00:23:35,275 --> 00:23:37,194
<i>While Frank was getting the drinks...</i>

337
00:23:37,355 --> 00:23:42,075
<i>...I was trying to figure out the most
graceful way to break it to him.</i>

338
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:53,476
By the way, I have eight children.

339
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:02,516
Speaking of eight children,
that's what I have.

340
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:08,116
Have I mentioned
that I have eight children?

341
00:24:11,277 --> 00:24:14,116
I have eight children.

342
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:18,076
Well, don't look at me. I just got here.

343
00:24:20,597 --> 00:24:22,637
Excuse me, please.

344
00:24:24,397 --> 00:24:25,917
Pardon me.

345
00:24:26,077 --> 00:24:27,478
That's all right.

346
00:24:27,637 --> 00:24:31,798
- That's why I come in this place.
- What's your excuse?

347
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:34,917
Pardon me, sir.

348
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:45,720
- I'm sorry, I...
- That's all right.

349
00:24:45,878 --> 00:24:48,319
- That's why I come to this place.
- What?

350
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:51,798
That's a line I picked up
on my way back from the bar.

351
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,039
I don't know, you may have
to drink this through your ear.

352
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:59,480
Frank, there's something
I wanna tell you.

353
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,440
What?

354
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,401
That was a wonderful dinner
we had tonight.

355
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,961
- I enjoyed all eight courses.
- So did I.

356
00:25:10,121 --> 00:25:12,721
- Speaking of children...
- We weren't speaking of children.

357
00:25:12,881 --> 00:25:15,201
- Thank goodness.
- Tonight, there are no children...

358
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:18,721
...in the world.
We're all alone on this desert island.

359
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:22,681
Just you and me
and a native who makes Irish coffee.

360
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,560
I'll drink to that.

361
00:25:30,761 --> 00:25:32,402
- Helen.
- Yes, Frank?

362
00:25:32,561 --> 00:25:34,882
There's something I've been meaning
to tell you.

363
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:37,962
- What?
- No, I want you to look at me first.

364
00:25:39,402 --> 00:25:41,721
No, look at me.

365
00:25:43,201 --> 00:25:46,282
- Just a moment.
- May I have a light?

366
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:52,242
Not on your life, sweetheart.

367
00:26:01,804 --> 00:26:03,604
Ridiculous.

368
00:26:08,963 --> 00:26:10,403
- Something wrong?
- No.

369
00:26:10,564 --> 00:26:12,723
No, no.
What did you want to tell me?

370
00:26:12,884 --> 00:26:16,403
Well, this is the last time
I'm going to bring up the subject...

371
00:26:16,564 --> 00:26:18,684
...but you do like children,
don't you?

372
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:21,763
- Yeah. Yeah, within reason.
- In that case, the hell with it.

373
00:26:21,924 --> 00:26:23,924
No. No, no,
as long as you brought it up...

374
00:26:24,085 --> 00:26:26,404
...there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

375
00:26:26,565 --> 00:26:29,405
- What?
- Well...

376
00:26:31,005 --> 00:26:33,285
What?

377
00:26:33,486 --> 00:26:35,846
- What's the matter?
- I beg your pardon.

378
00:26:36,006 --> 00:26:39,164
- Something wrong?
- Yes. Yes, Frank...

379
00:26:39,326 --> 00:26:41,605
...I have this terrible craving
for a cigarette.

380
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:45,047
I don't know what I'll do if I don't get
a cigarette. I may have a fit.

381
00:26:45,205 --> 00:26:47,247
Could you get me a pack
from the machine?

382
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:49,967
What brand? King-size or regular?
Filter or non-filter?

383
00:26:50,126 --> 00:26:51,526
- Yeah, wonderful.
- What?

384
00:26:51,685 --> 00:26:54,247
- And hurry.
- Well, here, hold this.

385
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:04,207
Hello, nurse.

386
00:27:05,126 --> 00:27:08,448
- Darrell.
- Well, Helen.

387
00:27:08,607 --> 00:27:10,847
Hello, Darrell.

388
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:13,248
Your Irish coffee is winking at me.

389
00:27:13,407 --> 00:27:15,528
- Darrell, help me.
- Does this happen often...

390
00:27:15,688 --> 00:27:19,008
...or only during the moulting season?
- Hurry, please.

391
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:22,167
Now, don't you worry, honey.
I'm very good at this.

392
00:27:22,328 --> 00:27:25,769
I've got an admiral
with a loose toupee.

393
00:27:27,249 --> 00:27:29,209
Coming through.

394
00:27:32,368 --> 00:27:34,368
Pardon me.

395
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,288
I'm sorry.

396
00:27:36,449 --> 00:27:39,328
Back for seconds?

397
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:47,130
Darrell, what are you doing here?
Chaperoning?

398
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:50,569
Oh, no, I've been here since yesterday.
Haven't been able to get out.

399
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,250
You mean you haven't been trying.

400
00:27:52,411 --> 00:27:55,769
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks. I don't smoke.

401
00:27:56,569 --> 00:27:59,329
- What did you do to your eye?
- What did you do to my eye?

402
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,890
Don't listen to him. It's perfect.

403
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:03,851
Let's drink to the perfect couple.

404
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,651
Two people who have
so much in common.

405
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,131
It's positively nauseating.

406
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,771
To our nurse.

407
00:28:10,971 --> 00:28:13,730
You know, I just found out
that she has a family of...

408
00:28:13,891 --> 00:28:18,051
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- That's all right. I'm used to it.

409
00:28:18,211 --> 00:28:22,531
Over at Frank's, when they pass
the soup, it's like Niagara Falls.

410
00:28:22,692 --> 00:28:25,412
He probably hasn't mentioned it,
but he happens to have a...

411
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:28,092
- Gosh, I'm sorry.
- Sure is a rough sea tonight.

412
00:28:28,251 --> 00:28:30,172
Yeah, it's very crowded in here.

413
00:28:30,332 --> 00:28:32,491
Yeah, speaking of crowds...

414
00:28:32,652 --> 00:28:35,932
...you know, you two kids
really belong to each other.

415
00:28:36,093 --> 00:28:38,173
I just found out
that she's the mother of...

416
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:41,373
Squeezing through...
Who pushed me?

417
00:28:41,532 --> 00:28:44,613
- Here, let me help you.
- Hey, if you two wanna be alone...

418
00:28:44,772 --> 00:28:47,212
...give a guy a hint.
- Let's get out of here.

419
00:28:47,374 --> 00:28:48,653
Sorry.

420
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:04,094
Frank.

421
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:07,815
What? How could you lose your slip?

422
00:29:07,974 --> 00:29:11,335
Don't ask questions.
It's back there someplace.

423
00:29:11,494 --> 00:29:14,654
Do something
about that floating eyelash.

424
00:29:33,576 --> 00:29:36,497
Oh, you are a tiger, aren't you?

425
00:29:50,817 --> 00:29:55,137
Frank, before we go any further,
there's something I have to tell you.

426
00:29:55,298 --> 00:29:57,576
- Now what fell off?
- No, no, nothing like that.

427
00:29:57,738 --> 00:30:00,136
I wish it were something that trivial.

428
00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:04,978
Frank, I have eight children.

429
00:30:05,298 --> 00:30:08,698
- Eight children!
- Four boys, four girls.

430
00:30:08,857 --> 00:30:10,978
Different ages.

431
00:30:11,657 --> 00:30:15,019
Frank. Frank, we're on a cable car.

432
00:30:15,218 --> 00:30:18,377
- Of course.
- I get sick on cable cars.

433
00:30:18,578 --> 00:30:20,858
- Wait till you hear what I tell you.
- What?

434
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:24,898
- I have 10 children.
- Ten?

435
00:30:25,219 --> 00:30:28,419
Ten? Ten!

436
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:31,459
Three boys, five girls.

437
00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:36,140
- That's only eight.
- And two on loan-out.

438
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,259
Frank, eight and 10 is...

439
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,619
Ridiculous.

440
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:46,861
Helen, let's get off this damn thing.
Now I'm feeling sick.

441
00:30:59,101 --> 00:31:02,141
Frank, what do you mean,
"two on loan-out"?

442
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,021
Well, a man alone...

443
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:07,901
...I just haven't been able to keep
a family that large together.

444
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,901
My brother and sister- in-law
have the two youngest.

445
00:31:11,061 --> 00:31:14,382
- That's awful.
- That's what my kids keep telling me.

446
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:18,662
They hate me for it,
and I'm on their side.

447
00:31:32,222 --> 00:31:34,423
I wish you had known Dick.

448
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:37,583
- What was he like?
- Like you, in many ways.

449
00:31:37,743 --> 00:31:41,663
All wrapped up in the Navy
and his children.

450
00:31:42,703 --> 00:31:45,304
And in you?

451
00:31:57,664 --> 00:32:01,505
Frank, I wanna thank you
for a wonderful evening.

452
00:32:01,663 --> 00:32:03,944
It was nice knowing you.

453
00:32:04,265 --> 00:32:06,586
It was nice knowing you.

454
00:32:10,826 --> 00:32:12,465
- You know what?
- What?

455
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:15,384
- I'd like to buy you something.
- Oh, that isn't necessary.

456
00:32:15,545 --> 00:32:18,986
Souvenir of our first and last date.

457
00:32:24,746 --> 00:32:27,586
- How about that Buddha?
- Oh, no.

458
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:29,747
That looks like real jade.

459
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:33,625
- How about that little fan?
- Fifty-five cents' worth of memories?

460
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:36,547
That's a pretty little lady.

461
00:32:43,347 --> 00:32:45,146
- You have excellent taste.
- Thank you.

462
00:32:45,307 --> 00:32:47,346
This is a Chinese goddess...

463
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:50,988
...who confers her magical powers
on all who gaze upon her.

464
00:32:51,147 --> 00:32:53,147
- What is she called?
- Kuan Yin.

465
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:56,748
- What does that mean?
- Joyous symbol of fertility.

466
00:33:11,868 --> 00:33:13,749
Wave him off.
Bring him around again.

467
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,950
3-4-Paddles. Wave it off
and bring it around again.

468
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,189
Why didn't you tell me
she had eight kids?

469
00:33:19,348 --> 00:33:20,630
Why didn't I tell you?

470
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:23,588
I got third-degree Irish coffee burns
trying to tell you.

471
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,829
But don't you worry about a thing.

472
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:28,789
I've got a few less-crowded ladies
who'll knock your hat off.

473
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,109
Let's drop the subject. I've had it.

474
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:33,150
You haven't,
and that's what worries me.

475
00:33:33,309 --> 00:33:36,431
- You've been in dry dock too long.
- Ask him to move the ball around.

476
00:33:36,589 --> 00:33:39,030
Come in low, check the red cell
and come on in.

477
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:41,109
3-4-Paddles, move the ball around.

478
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,029
Check the red cell and bring it on in.

479
00:33:43,391 --> 00:33:46,111
It's no use. What girl is gonna want
to spend an evening...

480
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:49,192
...with a man who has 10 children?
- A girl who doesn't know it.

481
00:33:49,351 --> 00:33:50,990
- Want me to lie?
- Of course not.

482
00:33:51,151 --> 00:33:54,070
- Don't bring the subject up until after.
- Here he comes.

483
00:34:05,271 --> 00:34:07,352
3-4-Paddles. Nice pass.

484
00:34:07,511 --> 00:34:10,032
Now, I know a quiet little
Japanese restaurant.

485
00:34:10,192 --> 00:34:12,391
I'll make the reservations.

486
00:34:13,032 --> 00:34:14,353
Madeleine Love.

487
00:34:14,512 --> 00:34:17,753
Now, there is a girl
who is definitely not a talker.

488
00:34:19,873 --> 00:34:21,992
What sort of a girl is she?

489
00:34:30,474 --> 00:34:32,793
Does that answer your question?

490
00:34:35,554 --> 00:34:38,514
No, Darrell, and stop trying
to arrange my life.

491
00:34:38,673 --> 00:34:40,634
Helen, I'm surprised
you haven't met him.

492
00:34:40,793 --> 00:34:42,074
Make a fist.

493
00:34:43,235 --> 00:34:45,114
I haven't done anything yet.

494
00:34:45,275 --> 00:34:47,954
I was practising.
He's a wonderful doctor...

495
00:34:48,114 --> 00:34:49,795
...the kind who scrubs for a date.

496
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:52,315
Tremendous reputation.
Nine handicap.

497
00:34:52,474 --> 00:34:53,994
Now.

498
00:34:56,635 --> 00:34:57,914
No more dates.

499
00:34:58,074 --> 00:35:00,835
Don't think of him as a date,
think of him as a meal.

500
00:35:00,994 --> 00:35:03,554
Now, I know a quiet little
Japanese restaurant.

501
00:35:03,715 --> 00:35:05,635
I'll make the reservations.

502
00:35:05,795 --> 00:35:07,356
Don't rush me.

503
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:11,715
What does he look like?

504
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:15,197
I hate to use the word "Adonis,"
but there's no other way to say it.

505
00:35:15,356 --> 00:35:18,476
A touch of grey at the temples,
very distinguished.

506
00:35:19,476 --> 00:35:21,675
Is he tall?

507
00:35:21,835 --> 00:35:25,235
He used to be a basketball player.

508
00:35:27,077 --> 00:35:29,197
I had to lie, of course.

509
00:35:29,356 --> 00:35:32,356
But anybody who knew Frank and
Helen knew they belonged together.

510
00:35:32,516 --> 00:35:36,157
All I had to do was let them stumble
over each other a few times.

511
00:35:36,318 --> 00:35:38,757
You have to do that
with the marrying kind of people.

512
00:35:38,918 --> 00:35:42,998
<i>So I told her that Dr. Ashford
was about 6'2", 6'3".</i>

513
00:35:44,318 --> 00:35:47,717
<i>A harmless little white lie.</i>

514
00:35:48,597 --> 00:35:51,679
<i>I wondered if the doctor would
be so attentive if I told him...</i>

515
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:54,958
<i>...I had three children taller
than he was.</i>

516
00:36:00,518 --> 00:36:03,318
<i>Darrell's arrangement for my
evening hadn't uttered a word...</i>

517
00:36:03,478 --> 00:36:06,239
<i>...since I pick ed her up. I had
no idea what was on her mind...</i>

518
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:09,318
<i>...until we drew up in front
of the restaurant.</i>

519
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,438
There. I hate suspense, don't you?

520
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,199
Now you know and I know.

521
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,679
Let's have a quick dinner.

522
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:27,119
Keep the motor running.

523
00:36:45,722 --> 00:36:47,882
Darrell said we had a lot in common.

524
00:36:49,842 --> 00:36:53,121
After all, you're a nurse,
I'm a doctor.

525
00:36:53,802 --> 00:36:55,362
What's your specialty?

526
00:36:55,521 --> 00:36:57,601
Obstetrics.

527
00:36:57,762 --> 00:37:00,681
<i>Darrell had a malicious
sense of humour.</i>

528
00:37:06,882 --> 00:37:10,123
<i>I was upset that Frank
had seen me with Dr. Ashford.</i>

529
00:37:10,282 --> 00:37:12,123
<i>I don't know why.</i>

530
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:21,563
<i>For some stupid reason,
I had the feeling I was being unfaithful.</i>

531
00:37:21,724 --> 00:37:24,643
<i>And Madeleine had
only taken off my shoes.</i>

532
00:37:24,923 --> 00:37:28,643
<i>The doctor's bedside manner
was a little previous.</i>

533
00:37:32,923 --> 00:37:35,644
<i>I was embarrassed to think
that Frank might be watching.</i>

534
00:37:35,804 --> 00:37:37,083
<i>He was.</i>

535
00:37:38,925 --> 00:37:41,125
You're not worshipping me.

536
00:37:47,605 --> 00:37:49,085
Thank you.

537
00:37:51,525 --> 00:37:54,405
Helen, I might as well be honest.

538
00:37:54,565 --> 00:38:00,126
I'm a very lonely man. There are times
that I feel I could kick over the traces.

539
00:38:00,286 --> 00:38:02,885
- I'm not lonely at all.
- Give up this race for money.

540
00:38:03,045 --> 00:38:06,286
- I'm the mother of eight children.
- Travel to all the romantic places.

541
00:38:06,445 --> 00:38:09,246
- I have eight.
- If I could find someone to go with me.

542
00:38:09,405 --> 00:38:11,606
- Doctor. Doctor.
- I'd like to find places...

543
00:38:11,766 --> 00:38:13,965
I don't think you've
been paying attention.

544
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:18,246
I said, I am the mother
of eight children.

545
00:38:21,327 --> 00:38:25,206
I've always admired a woman
with a sense of humour.

546
00:38:30,887 --> 00:38:35,088
<i>Meanwhile, back at the ranch,
it was round-up time.</i>

547
00:38:36,728 --> 00:38:38,608
That's a very handsome family.

548
00:38:38,768 --> 00:38:41,248
- Very handsome.
- Thank you.

549
00:38:42,648 --> 00:38:43,929
Excuse me a moment, please?

550
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:45,728
Oh, of course.

551
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,570
Dr. Ashford?

552
00:39:20,851 --> 00:39:22,451
Wasn't that your date?

553
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,050
Yes, it was.

554
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,650
He had an emergency.

555
00:39:26,811 --> 00:39:29,931
- Come on, I'll take you home. Hop in.
- Oh, no, I wouldn't dream...

556
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,811
- Madeleine doesn't mind, do you?
- Are you kidding?

557
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:35,170
- You see?
- Well...

558
00:39:57,333 --> 00:40:00,572
She's my oldest girl. She's going
with this boy who rides a motorcycle.

559
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:02,932
Has hair practically
down to his shoulders...

560
00:40:03,092 --> 00:40:05,132
...and I think it's bleached.

561
00:40:05,492 --> 00:40:08,813
She never talks to me about him,
never brings him in so I can meet him.

562
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:11,813
- I hardly know what to do.
- You can't tell her not to see him.

563
00:40:11,974 --> 00:40:14,534
- It's like shooting off the starting gun.
- I know.

564
00:40:14,693 --> 00:40:18,213
You know, she's barely 16, and when
he brings her home at night...

565
00:40:18,373 --> 00:40:20,893
...they stay outside
for about half an hour, kissing.

566
00:40:21,054 --> 00:40:23,454
Heavens to Betsy!
What will they think of next?

567
00:40:23,614 --> 00:40:25,134
My Veronica, she's 7.

568
00:40:25,295 --> 00:40:29,295
She's so boy crazy, I'm afraid she's
gonna get married before she's 9.

569
00:40:32,494 --> 00:40:35,735
She doesn't care about school.
Only thing she can read are pictures.

570
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:38,614
Yeah, yeah. Well, Tommy's
almost 9. He can hardly read.

571
00:40:38,775 --> 00:40:41,215
But Jean, who's only 7,
reads better than he does.

572
00:40:41,376 --> 00:40:42,615
I have that in spades.

573
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:44,974
Louise is 12,
she corrects Rusty's spelling.

574
00:40:45,135 --> 00:40:47,855
Well, Tommy can help
Colleen and Janette with their math...

575
00:40:48,016 --> 00:40:51,135
...but he can't read.
- I don't believe this conversation.

576
00:40:51,295 --> 00:40:52,815
Did you put something
in my sugar?

577
00:40:52,976 --> 00:40:55,416
I have a strange feeling
I'm taking a trip.

578
00:40:55,576 --> 00:40:57,335
- How many kids do you have?
- Ten.

579
00:40:58,097 --> 00:41:01,896
Helen, there's no reason for us
to avoid seeing each other.

580
00:41:02,456 --> 00:41:05,056
Well, I think we certainly
could be friends.

581
00:41:05,217 --> 00:41:08,737
The fact I'm a man and you're a woman
doesn't have anything to do with it.

582
00:41:08,896 --> 00:41:11,056
And then the papa bear
said to the mama bear:

583
00:41:11,217 --> 00:41:13,737
"Who's been sleeping in my bed?"

584
00:41:13,898 --> 00:41:15,938
Oh, come on,
drop me off at the exit.

585
00:41:16,097 --> 00:41:19,378
Then you two can work yourselves
up to a wild game of post office.

586
00:41:19,536 --> 00:41:21,257
No, I couldn't do that to you.

587
00:41:21,418 --> 00:41:24,577
Oh, please, daddy, I'd prefer it.
Ten kids?

588
00:41:24,737 --> 00:41:26,898
I'm nervous just sitting next to you.

589
00:41:27,097 --> 00:41:28,858
- Helen.
- Yes?

590
00:41:29,018 --> 00:41:32,617
Why am I pretending? I want to see
you again, and not just to be friends...

591
00:41:32,778 --> 00:41:34,579
...and not just to talk about children.

592
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:37,097
- I want to see you again too.
- Know something else?

593
00:41:37,257 --> 00:41:40,259
In spite of all the aggravation
and the misery and the yelling...

594
00:41:40,418 --> 00:41:43,498
...I'm glad I have 10 children.
- And I'm glad I have my eight.

595
00:41:43,659 --> 00:41:46,458
And I'm glad I'm careful.

596
00:41:47,818 --> 00:41:49,659
<i>Between our work
and the children...</i>

597
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:53,418
<i>...we somehow were able
to steal a few hours alone.</i>

598
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:39,905
<i>When every place we went was better
because we were together...</i>

599
00:43:40,065 --> 00:43:42,746
<i>...and I suddenly realised
the emptiness was gone...</i>

600
00:43:42,905 --> 00:43:46,226
<i>...and the world just might
be worth living in again...</i>

601
00:43:46,385 --> 00:43:48,905
<i>...I knew it was time for the acid test.</i>

602
00:43:49,065 --> 00:43:52,065
<i>I invited Helen to my house
to meet my mafia.</i>

603
00:43:54,545 --> 00:43:56,467
Here she comes!
Here she comes!

604
00:43:56,626 --> 00:43:57,907
What does she look like?

605
00:43:58,067 --> 00:44:01,027
Mean. You can see it in her eyes.

606
00:44:06,148 --> 00:44:08,188
Frank, I'm frightened.

607
00:44:08,347 --> 00:44:10,186
Now, don't worry.

608
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:13,507
I had a long talk with the children.
They're going to love you.

609
00:44:14,907 --> 00:44:16,987
Who locked the door?

610
00:44:21,668 --> 00:44:23,268
Sorry, Dad.

611
00:44:24,268 --> 00:44:26,349
I'll talk to you later.

612
00:44:26,507 --> 00:44:28,949
Well, group, this is Mrs. North.

613
00:44:29,108 --> 00:44:31,028
- Helen.
- You know Louise.

614
00:44:31,188 --> 00:44:32,628
- Oh, yes. Hello, Louise.
- Hi.

615
00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:34,068
- And Mike.
- Mike.

616
00:44:34,228 --> 00:44:35,949
- And Rusty and Rosemary.
- Hello.

617
00:44:36,108 --> 00:44:37,389
- Susan.
- Hello, Susan.

618
00:44:37,548 --> 00:44:38,829
- Veronica.
- Hello, Veronica.

619
00:44:38,989 --> 00:44:40,150
- And Greg.
- Greg.

620
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:41,588
You've met the family...

621
00:44:41,748 --> 00:44:43,469
...why don't we have a drink.
- Frank.

622
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:46,389
- Yeah?
- This is only seven.

623
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:49,389
Mary. Where's Mary?

624
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:51,030
She's hiding.

625
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,469
Mary, come on, let's not play games.

626
00:44:57,389 --> 00:44:59,670
Hello, Mary. I'm Aunt Helen.

627
00:44:59,829 --> 00:45:02,510
You are not!
I don't want another mother!

628
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:05,309
I don't want another mother!

629
00:45:08,271 --> 00:45:11,030
Frank, I think I'm ready
for that drink now.

630
00:45:11,192 --> 00:45:13,512
Mike, you think you can
handle the bar?

631
00:45:13,672 --> 00:45:15,471
What would you like, Aunt Helen?

632
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,552
I'd like a light screwdriver, please.
Very light.

633
00:45:18,711 --> 00:45:20,550
That's orange juice
with a shot of vodka.

634
00:45:20,711 --> 00:45:23,351
- I know, Dad.
- I'm sorry. I'll have Scotch and water.

635
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:24,911
I know, Dad.

636
00:45:25,072 --> 00:45:27,672
I keep forgetting Mike is 18.

637
00:45:28,311 --> 00:45:31,152
Frank, do you really think it was
a good idea, my coming here?

638
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:35,313
Of course. If you hadn't,
you might have been hit by a truck.

639
00:45:35,472 --> 00:45:37,393
Everything's gonna be all right.

640
00:45:37,952 --> 00:45:39,753
You're sitting on my painting!

641
00:45:39,913 --> 00:45:41,632
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.

642
00:45:41,793 --> 00:45:43,753
It's all right.

643
00:46:06,233 --> 00:46:08,795
- You wanna fill that with orange juice?
- Who's it for?

644
00:46:08,954 --> 00:46:10,994
- Aunt Helen.
- Mike, these are finished.

645
00:46:11,153 --> 00:46:12,715
Susan's gonna help you.

646
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:15,394
Susie, take these in there, will you?
Thank you.

647
00:46:15,994 --> 00:46:18,594
Okay, I'm gonna put these
on the table.

648
00:46:33,115 --> 00:46:34,795
Hey, Rusty.

649
00:46:35,516 --> 00:46:39,835
- You wanna be a cocktail waitress?
- All right. Which is which?

650
00:46:40,036 --> 00:46:42,315
Aunt Helen, Uncle Daddy.

651
00:47:03,797 --> 00:47:05,677
- What's this?
- An alligator.

652
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:08,637
- A flying alligator?
- See the two little babies?

653
00:47:08,797 --> 00:47:12,197
Two little babies.
And these are from Mars, I suppose.

654
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:15,757
They're very good.
Oh, thank you. Rusty?

655
00:47:15,918 --> 00:47:17,677
Hold it, Susan.

656
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:20,199
How about a toast
to our guest, everybody.

657
00:47:20,798 --> 00:47:24,559
Through the teeth and over the gums.
Look out, stomach, here it comes.

658
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:27,159
Hold the Dylan Thomas
till later, Greg.

659
00:47:27,318 --> 00:47:29,559
To our charming dinner guest...

660
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:32,760
...welcome aboard.
- Thank you. Thank you.

661
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,121
It's delicious.

662
00:48:05,521 --> 00:48:09,481
That's just wonderful.
And where was Veronica born?

663
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:11,242
- In Japan.
- In Japan.

664
00:48:11,402 --> 00:48:15,641
I call her my little fortune cookie
because she came right after dinner.

665
00:48:22,762 --> 00:48:24,043
That's funny.

666
00:48:25,882 --> 00:48:27,682
Where's the fire?

667
00:48:27,842 --> 00:48:29,123
Dinner is served.

668
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:30,563
Oh, dinner is served.

669
00:48:30,722 --> 00:48:33,523
I want you to know Rosemary
and Louise cooked this dinner.

670
00:48:33,682 --> 00:48:37,842
Oh, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.
That's absolutely wonderful, Rosemary.

671
00:48:38,003 --> 00:48:40,603
- I'm Susan.
- Oh, of course you are.

672
00:48:40,764 --> 00:48:44,284
- And don't you ever change, honey.
- Let's go, Susan.

673
00:48:45,202 --> 00:48:47,643
You have a wonderful family.

674
00:48:47,804 --> 00:48:51,164
They're all just wonderful.
Absolutely wonderful.

675
00:48:51,324 --> 00:48:53,563
Wonderful, wonderful,
beautiful children.

676
00:48:53,724 --> 00:48:55,003
Just so wonderful.

677
00:48:55,643 --> 00:48:57,684
Watch that first step.
That's a dilly.

678
00:48:57,844 --> 00:48:59,844
Greg, will you hold
the chair for our guest?

679
00:49:00,005 --> 00:49:01,284
Sure.

680
00:49:01,445 --> 00:49:02,885
Thank you, Greg.

681
00:49:04,764 --> 00:49:06,045
Thank you, Greg.

682
00:49:08,766 --> 00:49:11,206
- I'm hungry!
- Veronica.

683
00:49:13,724 --> 00:49:15,244
Bless us, O Lord...

684
00:49:18,326 --> 00:49:19,925
Pardon me.

685
00:49:20,485 --> 00:49:24,045
And these, thy gifts,
which we are about to receive...

686
00:49:26,565 --> 00:49:28,005
Pardon me.

687
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:31,766
From thy bounty through
Christ our Lord.

688
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,527
Amen.

689
00:49:33,686 --> 00:49:37,367
- You all right?
- Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.

690
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:42,206
I'm hungry. Can I have a potato?

691
00:49:50,447 --> 00:49:51,887
Pass it around.

692
00:49:53,447 --> 00:49:55,487
- I'm hungry!
- I want some bread.

693
00:49:55,648 --> 00:49:58,688
- Hey, come on, I want the bread.
- Can I have some milk?

694
00:50:00,329 --> 00:50:02,088
Here, want some milk?

695
00:50:02,487 --> 00:50:03,889
I can do it myself.

696
00:50:04,048 --> 00:50:07,048
Sure, you can do it yourself.
Certainly you can.

697
00:50:07,208 --> 00:50:08,648
Sure you can.

698
00:50:08,809 --> 00:50:12,088
Boy, is it warm in here!
Don't you think it's warm in here?

699
00:50:12,248 --> 00:50:14,048
- Want some potatoes?
- Yes.

700
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:16,648
There we go.

701
00:50:16,809 --> 00:50:19,048
- You want some potatoes?
- Okay.

702
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:22,849
- Okay, there you are.
- Hey! You got it on my dress!

703
00:50:28,449 --> 00:50:29,730
I'm...

704
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:35,010
Oh, good heavens!

705
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:38,929
Oh, I'm so...

706
00:50:40,449 --> 00:50:45,411
I'm sorry, honey.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I...

707
00:50:46,411 --> 00:50:48,530
Rosemary,
help Veronica get cleaned up.

708
00:50:49,331 --> 00:50:52,371
- I didn't mean it.
- I'll clean her up.

709
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:55,971
I'm sorry.

710
00:50:56,132 --> 00:51:00,371
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't know
what's wrong with me.

711
00:51:00,532 --> 00:51:02,371
What a terrible thing to do.

712
00:51:02,532 --> 00:51:04,052
I'm...

713
00:51:07,652 --> 00:51:08,932
I'm sorry.

714
00:51:12,811 --> 00:51:14,373
Dick, I feel sick again.

715
00:51:14,532 --> 00:51:17,452
- It's Frank.
- Oh, Lord, what have I done?

716
00:51:17,612 --> 00:51:19,572
- You haven't done anything.
- Yes, I have.

717
00:51:19,733 --> 00:51:22,213
I've fallen in love,
that's what I've done.

718
00:51:22,373 --> 00:51:25,773
I promised myself
I'd never fall in love again.

719
00:51:25,934 --> 00:51:28,534
And I wanted to make such
a good impression on you...

720
00:51:28,693 --> 00:51:32,132
...and your children, and now
I've been acting like an idiot.

721
00:51:32,293 --> 00:51:33,932
And I don't know why.

722
00:51:34,094 --> 00:51:36,494
I don't know why.

723
00:51:36,653 --> 00:51:37,853
I just feel...

724
00:51:38,014 --> 00:51:41,253
Oh, if this damn room would stop
rolling around, maybe I could find...

725
00:51:41,414 --> 00:51:43,454
...someplace to be sick.
- Louise...

726
00:51:43,614 --> 00:51:46,894
...you better show Mrs. North
the bathroom and help her.

727
00:51:47,054 --> 00:51:49,014
- This way.
- I don't know why.

728
00:51:49,173 --> 00:51:51,375
I don't know why.

729
00:52:00,454 --> 00:52:04,215
The court of inquiry
is now in session.

730
00:52:21,655 --> 00:52:24,016
You didn't have
to wait dinner for me.

731
00:52:24,177 --> 00:52:26,856
We've decided to use
our company manners.

732
00:52:27,016 --> 00:52:30,217
Helen, the boys have
something to tell you.

733
00:52:30,376 --> 00:52:34,217
Mrs. North, I apologise for putting
all that gin in your drink.

734
00:52:34,378 --> 00:52:37,016
Oh, that's what did it.

735
00:52:37,177 --> 00:52:39,257
And I apologise for all that vodka.

736
00:52:39,418 --> 00:52:40,938
And I apologise for the Scotch.

737
00:52:42,538 --> 00:52:44,137
Scotch, vodka and...

738
00:52:44,297 --> 00:52:47,137
Helen, you've been the victim
of an alcoholic Pearl Harbor.

739
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:49,177
It's amazing you survived at all.

740
00:52:49,338 --> 00:52:51,338
Your bartenders will be
dealt with later.

741
00:52:51,498 --> 00:52:53,617
Oh, please.
Please, Frank, don't blame them.

742
00:52:53,777 --> 00:52:55,378
At least what they did was honest.

743
00:52:55,538 --> 00:52:58,818
They don't want another mother,
and I don't blame them.

744
00:52:59,139 --> 00:53:00,378
And you, Frank...

745
00:53:00,539 --> 00:53:02,978
Frank, I think you should
be on your ship at sea.

746
00:53:03,139 --> 00:53:04,898
That's where you belong.

747
00:53:05,539 --> 00:53:08,099
And if the children don't
want me, I understand.

748
00:53:08,338 --> 00:53:10,340
Now, hear this.

749
00:53:10,498 --> 00:53:14,619
My interest in you has nothing to do
with securing a mother for my children.

750
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:16,659
They don't deserve anyone
as good as you.

751
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:20,139
Furthermore, I have no desire
to go back to sea.

752
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,460
In fact, if you'll have me, Helen...

753
00:53:23,621 --> 00:53:25,619
...I'll be happy to remain
ashore forever...

754
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,500
...because I happen to love you.

755
00:53:27,659 --> 00:53:30,099
And nobody put anything in my drink.

756
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:33,021
- Frank, do you mean that?
- Of course I mean it.

757
00:53:33,181 --> 00:53:35,701
That's why I said it in front
of so many witnesses...

758
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,981
...untrustworthy though they may be.

759
00:53:39,621 --> 00:53:41,061
Oh, Frank.

760
00:53:48,422 --> 00:53:50,461
I give it six months.

761
00:54:17,182 --> 00:54:18,623
<i>It was a typical wedding.</i>

762
00:54:18,784 --> 00:54:22,023
<i>Enemies of the bride on the right,
enemies of the groom on the left.</i>

763
00:54:22,184 --> 00:54:25,023
<i>I've seen firing squads
with more compassion.</i>

764
00:54:25,184 --> 00:54:27,063
<i>When I saw all the children lined up...</i>

765
00:54:27,224 --> 00:54:30,824
<i>...I wondered if Frank and I really
had the right to do this to them.</i>

766
00:54:30,985 --> 00:54:35,105
<i>All you had to do was look at those
faces to guess what they were thinking.</i>

767
00:54:35,264 --> 00:54:37,184
<i>All those photographers outside...</i>

768
00:54:37,344 --> 00:54:40,664
<i>...they're gonna plaster our pictures
all over the newspapers and TV.</i>

769
00:54:40,824 --> 00:54:43,344
<i>We won't be a family,
we're going to be a freak show.</i>

770
00:54:43,505 --> 00:54:47,144
<i>When the kids at school find out
about this, I'm gonna kill myself.</i>

771
00:54:47,306 --> 00:54:49,065
<i>I wonder why they're
getting married.</i>

772
00:54:49,226 --> 00:54:52,425
<i>Can there possibly be a physical thing
between them too?</i>

773
00:54:52,585 --> 00:54:54,545
<i>At their age?</i>

774
00:54:56,306 --> 00:54:58,865
<i>She has mean eyes.</i>

775
00:54:59,146 --> 00:55:02,146
<i>How can I do it to them?
How can I do it to Frank?</i>

776
00:55:02,306 --> 00:55:06,585
<i>All I have to do is be very calm,
turn around and run.</i>

777
00:55:06,746 --> 00:55:09,266
<i>On your mark, get set...</i>

778
00:55:09,425 --> 00:55:10,945
Helen.

779
00:55:14,547 --> 00:55:17,666
Damn the torpedoes.
Full speed ahead.

780
00:55:53,148 --> 00:55:54,670
- Here.
- What do you do with this?

781
00:55:54,829 --> 00:55:56,668
Throw it, stupid.

782
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:58,708
Hey!

783
00:56:08,789 --> 00:56:10,309
Cut it out!

784
00:56:18,911 --> 00:56:20,831
The snow came
a little early this year.

785
00:56:25,791 --> 00:56:27,271
He started it!

786
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:31,871
That's no way to act at a wedding.
That's not nice!

787
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:34,110
Don't worry.
We'll take care of the children.

788
00:56:34,271 --> 00:56:36,871
- Sure. Even if it kills us.
- It's only for the weekend.

789
00:56:37,032 --> 00:56:39,431
We'll be back Monday.
Goodbye, Janette.

790
00:56:39,592 --> 00:56:41,152
- Goodbye, Mommy.
- Be a good girl.

791
00:56:41,311 --> 00:56:42,871
- Goodbye, Tommy.
- See you.

792
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:44,351
Goodbye, Greg.

793
00:56:44,632 --> 00:56:46,152
Goodbye, Mike.

794
00:56:49,431 --> 00:56:50,791
Goodbye, Jean.

795
00:56:50,952 --> 00:56:53,233
Goodbye, Veronica.
Goodbye, Mary.

796
00:56:53,391 --> 00:56:56,072
Goodbye, Louise.
Bye, Jean.

797
00:56:56,393 --> 00:56:57,632
You already kissed me.

798
00:56:57,793 --> 00:56:58,913
Oh, I'm sorry.

799
00:56:59,072 --> 00:57:02,273
By the time they finish saying goodbye,
the honeymoon will be over.

800
00:57:02,434 --> 00:57:04,552
Goodbye, Colleen.
Take care of the little ones.

801
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:07,193
Goodbye, Phillip. What's that?

802
00:57:07,353 --> 00:57:08,632
Nothing.

803
00:57:10,032 --> 00:57:11,393
Maybe pneumonia.

804
00:57:11,554 --> 00:57:13,552
Oh, good heavens. Frank. Frank?

805
00:57:13,713 --> 00:57:16,034
Frank, tell me if you
think he has a fever.

806
00:57:16,313 --> 00:57:18,153
I do it back here.

807
00:57:18,313 --> 00:57:19,753
- He might.
- Oh, dear.

808
00:57:20,233 --> 00:57:23,554
- Do I have to go to school?
- Frank, I can't leave if Phillip's sick.

809
00:57:23,713 --> 00:57:27,833
Never in our entire married life will all
of our kids be healthy at the same time.

810
00:57:27,994 --> 00:57:30,594
But last year he had asthma.
His lungs haven't been too...

811
00:57:30,755 --> 00:57:33,155
- What's the matter?
- Something's wrong with Phillip.

812
00:57:33,315 --> 00:57:35,675
Get him to bed. Call the doctor.
We'll phone you...

813
00:57:35,835 --> 00:57:38,434
...soon as we check
into our hospital. I mean, our hotel.

814
00:57:38,594 --> 00:57:42,394
If it's the flu, call me right away. If it's
anything more serious, I'll call you.

815
00:57:42,554 --> 00:57:46,074
No, I couldn't do that. I wouldn't know.
Well, I better call you every hour.

816
00:57:46,235 --> 00:57:49,074
Make him stay in bed,
and until you're sure what he has...

817
00:57:49,235 --> 00:57:51,315
...keep the other children
out of the room.

818
00:57:51,476 --> 00:57:54,876
Be sure and tell the doctor
that he's allergic to penicillin...

819
00:57:55,036 --> 00:57:57,476
...all of the sulphas
and some of the mycins.

820
00:57:57,635 --> 00:58:00,717
- Also tell him that last year he had...
- Helen.

821
00:58:00,876 --> 00:58:02,795
We'll go away some other time.

822
00:58:03,277 --> 00:58:05,757
Oh, Frank, thank you.

823
00:58:17,157 --> 00:58:19,677
<i>I thought I saw the house cringe
as we drove up.</i>

824
00:58:19,836 --> 00:58:23,557
<i>It had been a dignified old Victorian
home when Frank and I found it.</i>

825
00:58:23,717 --> 00:58:26,717
<i>The only one large enough
that we could afford.</i>

826
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:29,878
<i>The plumbing wasn't the most modern,
the roof had to be repaired.</i>

827
00:58:30,038 --> 00:58:34,077
<i>But we had both fallen in love with it
when we learned it had four bathrooms.</i>

828
00:58:41,398 --> 00:58:44,918
<i>So in we marched:
The bride, the groom...</i>

829
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:47,039
<i>...one bottle of champagne...</i>

830
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:49,438
<i>And 16 children.</i>

831
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:55,400
Come on, darling, finish your tea.
Mother's tired and wants to go to bed.

832
00:58:57,798 --> 00:58:59,519
Now, is there anything else
you want?

833
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:01,599
Yeah, I wanna go home.

834
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,000
We are home, dear.
This is where we live now.

835
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:07,000
Then why can't I be Phillip anymore?

836
00:59:07,159 --> 00:59:08,840
Well, who says you can't be?

837
00:59:09,001 --> 00:59:10,800
That man.

838
00:59:12,721 --> 00:59:14,400
- Frank?
- Yes.

839
00:59:14,561 --> 00:59:16,721
And he says my name
is 12-Blue- D.

840
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,840
And if I forget I'm 12-Blue- D,
I can't get into the bathroom.

841
00:59:21,001 --> 00:59:25,322
Well, now, that's nothing
to be upset about, darling.

842
00:59:25,481 --> 00:59:28,161
That's just a system
that he learned in the Navy.

843
00:59:28,322 --> 00:59:29,882
Now, you stop worrying.

844
00:59:30,041 --> 00:59:33,242
I'm going to find out what's keeping
that doctor. You stay in bed.

845
00:59:34,282 --> 00:59:37,963
There you are, Janette.
You are 8-Red- B.

846
00:59:40,322 --> 00:59:43,202
And, Mary, you are 14-Red- C.

847
00:59:43,362 --> 00:59:45,561
- Veronica.
- What am I, again?

848
00:59:45,722 --> 00:59:46,722
You're 14-Red- C.

849
00:59:46,882 --> 00:59:49,603
Everybody's got a number
from the oldest to the youngest.

850
00:59:49,762 --> 00:59:52,643
All the bathrooms are a colour,
all the bedrooms are a letter.

851
00:59:52,802 --> 00:59:56,884
And that makes you number 14,
bathroom Red and room C.

852
00:59:57,043 --> 00:59:59,282
And this chart shows you
where it all is.

853
00:59:59,443 --> 01:00:01,083
Could you just point?

854
01:00:01,244 --> 01:00:03,523
It's right around the corner,
down the hall, love.

855
01:00:03,684 --> 01:00:04,684
Thank you.

856
01:00:04,844 --> 01:00:08,403
And, Veronica, you are 13-Red- A.

857
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:10,043
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

858
01:00:10,204 --> 01:00:12,164
Well, skipper, how goes the battle?

859
01:00:12,324 --> 01:00:14,643
They're fighting it,
but you can't beat the system.

860
01:00:14,804 --> 01:00:18,644
- I'm sorry if I upset your wedding night.
- I thought it was yours too.

861
01:00:18,804 --> 01:00:21,164
I didn't wanna sound anxious.

862
01:00:21,324 --> 01:00:24,125
Susan, you are 9-Red- A.

863
01:00:24,284 --> 01:00:26,204
If I can find it.

864
01:00:26,364 --> 01:00:27,684
Champagne iced?

865
01:00:27,844 --> 01:00:30,804
Yes, it's in our bedroom,
in a shiny new bucket.

866
01:00:30,965 --> 01:00:34,244
- Louise, you are 7-Red- C.
- All right.

867
01:00:34,405 --> 01:00:37,606
If we stay on schedule, my system
will have these kids bedded down...

868
01:00:37,766 --> 01:00:40,445
...in a half-hour,
and it's our turn next.

869
01:00:40,606 --> 01:00:42,885
Greg, you are 6-Blue- B.

870
01:00:43,045 --> 01:00:46,007
Aye, aye, sir.
I'll send up a flare if I get lost.

871
01:00:46,166 --> 01:00:48,246
- How's Phillip?
- That's what I'd like to know.

872
01:00:48,405 --> 01:00:50,646
- What's keeping that doctor?
- Probably the rain.

873
01:00:50,806 --> 01:00:53,326
Tommy, you are 10-Blue- D.

874
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:55,887
Why can't I have my own room
to myself, like Mike?

875
01:00:56,045 --> 01:00:57,327
You're not the oldest. Next.

876
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,847
You mean because
I'm not in your family.

877
01:01:00,007 --> 01:01:02,086
- Tommy!
- Now, look, you're all in my family.

878
01:01:02,246 --> 01:01:05,728
You have a beautiful room, D. It's
around the corner, down the main hall.

879
01:01:05,887 --> 01:01:07,606
Honey, wait. That's where Phillip is.

880
01:01:07,768 --> 01:01:08,887
- Phillip?
- Yes.

881
01:01:09,047 --> 01:01:10,688
Yes, number 12. You're right.

882
01:01:10,847 --> 01:01:13,248
I know he has the flu.
No one should sleep in there.

883
01:01:13,407 --> 01:01:15,007
That's the beauty of this system.

884
01:01:15,168 --> 01:01:17,047
It can be changed in an instant.

885
01:01:17,927 --> 01:01:19,889
All right, now hear this.
Now hear this.

886
01:01:20,047 --> 01:01:22,248
All C's and D's report
to the quarterdeck.

887
01:01:22,407 --> 01:01:25,288
There's been a slight rearrangement.
It may affect B.

888
01:01:25,449 --> 01:01:27,088
Everybody back!

889
01:01:28,369 --> 01:01:32,208
All right, lights are out
for a minute. Don't worry...

890
01:01:32,369 --> 01:01:35,009
...we have some emergency
candles right in here.

891
01:01:36,969 --> 01:01:39,009
- Helen.
- Yes, dear.

892
01:01:39,889 --> 01:01:44,010
Frank, do you think there's a power
failure all over or just in the house?

893
01:01:49,369 --> 01:01:52,570
Greg, take these downstairs.
Get some light downstairs.

894
01:01:55,931 --> 01:01:57,291
Where's 6-Blue- B?

895
01:01:57,451 --> 01:02:00,170
I found my room, but there's rain
coming through the roof.

896
01:02:00,331 --> 01:02:02,771
That's not possible.
They just finished re- shingling.

897
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:04,610
Well, they'll finish on Monday.

898
01:02:04,771 --> 01:02:07,331
- I'll go get some pots and pans.
- How old is this house?

899
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:09,132
Never mind. It's gonna be beautiful.

900
01:02:09,291 --> 01:02:12,210
- Take care of the little ones.
- Sister's locked in the bathroom.

901
01:02:12,371 --> 01:02:14,690
- What sister?
- I don't know her name yet.

902
01:02:14,851 --> 01:02:19,532
But she can't get out
and we can't get in. And it's my turn.

903
01:02:33,612 --> 01:02:35,693
Oh, my God, I'm too late.

904
01:02:35,853 --> 01:02:38,492
No, doctor, we're not praying.
The lights went out.

905
01:02:38,652 --> 01:02:40,452
Come on in. I'll give you a candle.

906
01:02:41,293 --> 01:02:42,652
What happened to the key?

907
01:02:42,813 --> 01:02:46,092
It fell out and the lights went out
and I can't find it.

908
01:02:46,253 --> 01:02:49,612
- Well, light your candle.
- I came in here before the candles.

909
01:02:51,853 --> 01:02:55,134
Well, look, I'm gonna pass
you a match through the keyhole.

910
01:02:55,293 --> 01:02:58,213
You light it, find the key
and unlock the door, okay?

911
01:02:58,373 --> 01:02:59,534
Okay.

912
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:02,215
Here comes the match. You see it?

913
01:03:04,173 --> 01:03:06,253
- Got it?
- I got it.

914
01:03:06,534 --> 01:03:08,375
- Well, light it.
- I can't.

915
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:09,534
Why not?

916
01:03:09,695 --> 01:03:11,735
Mommy won't let me play
with matches.

917
01:03:11,894 --> 01:03:14,815
- Helen!
- Yes, dear, I'm coming.

918
01:03:15,175 --> 01:03:18,375
Tell her it's all right to light a match,
find the key, open the door.

919
01:03:18,536 --> 01:03:20,215
- Who's in there?
- One of yours.

920
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:22,496
The one that's not allowed
to light matches.

921
01:03:22,655 --> 01:03:26,815
Oh, Jean. Jean, darling, it's all right
to light a match this time, sweetheart.

922
01:03:26,976 --> 01:03:29,496
All right, show's over.
Everybody back to your room.

923
01:03:29,655 --> 01:03:31,815
Go back to your room.
You go back. You go back.

924
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:34,456
- I'm the doctor.
- Hold your candle higher, will you?

925
01:03:34,615 --> 01:03:37,577
Jean? Jean, darling.

926
01:03:40,737 --> 01:03:42,376
I did it, I did it.

927
01:03:42,536 --> 01:03:44,697
- You certainly did.
- Here's your flashlight.

928
01:03:44,856 --> 01:03:46,416
Now, go to your room, dear.

929
01:03:46,737 --> 01:03:51,416
I'm 11-Red- A. I'm 11-Red- A.
I'm 11-Red- A.

930
01:03:51,657 --> 01:03:53,097
Concussion?

931
01:03:53,257 --> 01:03:57,297
Oh, no, no. It's not her, it's my...
Our boy Phillip.

932
01:03:57,458 --> 01:04:00,378
I don't know whether
I'm 14-Red- X or what.

933
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:03,137
How do you get
any food around here?

934
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:05,538
What's the name
of this organisation?

935
01:04:05,697 --> 01:04:08,458
No, I'm sorry it's a little confusing,
but, you see...

936
01:04:08,619 --> 01:04:10,177
...we were just married today.

937
01:04:11,297 --> 01:04:14,978
Congratulations. The next
20 years ought to be a lulu.

938
01:04:15,139 --> 01:04:17,458
- It's our room!
- Get out!

939
01:04:17,619 --> 01:04:20,938
Oh, no. You'll have to excuse me.
You go right down there.

940
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:25,018
You can say that again.

941
01:04:25,179 --> 01:04:27,739
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

942
01:04:27,898 --> 01:04:29,739
It's our room!

943
01:04:30,739 --> 01:04:32,539
What are you two boys
doing in here?

944
01:04:32,699 --> 01:04:34,298
- It's our room.
- Yeah, room B.

945
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:36,260
Janette, Colleen,
I'm surprised at you.

946
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:39,219
- Get out of the boys' room this instant.
- But it's our room.

947
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:40,659
It's on that board!

948
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:42,460
We're on the board too, you know!

949
01:04:42,621 --> 01:04:44,420
Get out of our room!

950
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:46,981
Hey, knock it off!
What's going on in here?

951
01:04:47,141 --> 01:04:48,501
What is this?

952
01:04:48,661 --> 01:04:52,181
Your blues and greens are wonderful,
but your he's and she's are mixed up.

953
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:55,820
Thank goodness. Let there be light.

954
01:04:55,981 --> 01:04:57,820
All right, boys,
pack your gear together.

955
01:04:57,981 --> 01:05:00,300
We'll straighten this out.
Get your stuff together.

956
01:05:00,461 --> 01:05:02,902
- Girls, come on, get to bed.
- I can't find my pyjamas.

957
01:05:03,061 --> 01:05:06,461
- Well, sleep without them one night.
- I'd rather die.

958
01:05:06,621 --> 01:05:09,021
You don't care what happens
to our family, do you?

959
01:05:09,181 --> 01:05:11,702
- Colleen.
- Mommy! Mommy!

960
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:14,302
There's a man trying to take
everybody's temperature.

961
01:05:14,463 --> 01:05:18,101
- Oh, good heavens.
- All right, come on, let's get organised.

962
01:05:24,943 --> 01:05:27,463
Oh, you found him, doctor.

963
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:31,342
No, that's not him. This one
doesn't have a temperature either.

964
01:05:31,503 --> 01:05:33,623
But that's Phillip.
He's the one that's sick.

965
01:05:33,784 --> 01:05:37,943
Pulse, normal. Blood pressure,
normal. Temperature, 98.6.

966
01:05:38,103 --> 01:05:41,222
In medical school,
they told us that means healthy.

967
01:05:42,903 --> 01:05:44,224
Phillip.

968
01:05:44,382 --> 01:05:47,103
I feel better now. He's a good doctor.

969
01:05:50,344 --> 01:05:52,744
Good news, Mr. Beardsley.
Your son's not sick at all.

970
01:05:52,903 --> 01:05:54,423
Oh, great. But keep it quiet.

971
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:57,543
I'll never get the C's and D's
back into B.

972
01:05:58,184 --> 01:05:59,784
Sorry.

973
01:05:59,945 --> 01:06:01,945
Would you do me a favour
and call my wife...

974
01:06:02,105 --> 01:06:04,465
...and tell her I'm on the way home?

975
01:06:04,625 --> 01:06:06,945
- Tell her thank you.
- For what?

976
01:06:07,105 --> 01:06:08,786
We don't have any children.

977
01:06:38,387 --> 01:06:41,947
- Is this the Beardsleys' new house?
- We've come to deliver the babies.

978
01:06:43,706 --> 01:06:45,387
Have a heart.

979
01:06:45,547 --> 01:06:48,067
Leave them
on somebody else's doorstep.

980
01:06:52,788 --> 01:06:54,427
Here we go.

981
01:06:56,947 --> 01:06:58,307
Dad! Dad! Come quick!

982
01:06:58,467 --> 01:07:00,588
They've brought
Joan and Germaine home.

983
01:07:00,748 --> 01:07:02,389
Come on. Come on.

984
01:07:05,228 --> 01:07:07,548
Joan! Germaine!

985
01:07:07,829 --> 01:07:09,588
Hi, everybody.

986
01:07:14,309 --> 01:07:16,708
It sure was nice of you
to bring them in the rain.

987
01:07:16,869 --> 01:07:20,389
Blame your crazy father. He insisted
the family had to be complete tonight.

988
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:23,909
When he used that Navy voice,
we didn't wanna be court-martialed.

989
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:27,309
They can't argue, and I needed
someone here on my side.

990
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:29,789
- Let me see that little angel.
- Bye- bye.

991
01:07:29,949 --> 01:07:33,271
- We'll bring their things in the morning.
- Thank you, Nancy. Good night.

992
01:07:33,429 --> 01:07:35,590
Good night, Helen. Good luck, Frank.

993
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:37,670
What a little doll.

994
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:41,150
Well, Murderers' Row is now complete.

995
01:07:41,311 --> 01:07:44,871
- Can I hold my sister?
- Let's get one thing straight.

996
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:47,710
There's no more "mine"
and there's no more "yours. "

997
01:07:47,871 --> 01:07:50,952
From now on,
everyone and everything is ours.

998
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:54,072
All right, troop, to bed, to bed.

999
01:07:56,351 --> 01:07:58,311
- Is this our house now?
- Yes, dear.

1000
01:07:58,472 --> 01:08:00,911
Can we invite some friends over?

1001
01:08:27,274 --> 01:08:29,514
Mrs. Beardsley.

1002
01:08:33,912 --> 01:08:36,394
Hey, you look beautiful.

1003
01:08:36,554 --> 01:08:40,394
- You mean for a mother of 18?
- I mean for a bride.

1004
01:08:54,034 --> 01:08:58,114
Frank, this is gonna sound silly,
but you know something?

1005
01:08:58,274 --> 01:09:01,515
- I'm nervous.
- You know something? So am I.

1006
01:09:05,515 --> 01:09:09,355
What did that girl say about you?
You are a tiger.

1007
01:09:11,515 --> 01:09:15,877
A slightly grey, slightly middle- aged,
but very much in love tiger.

1008
01:09:17,516 --> 01:09:21,395
Oh, Frank. Frank, do you think
it can work out?

1009
01:09:21,555 --> 01:09:24,436
Will we ever, ever really be
just one family?

1010
01:09:24,596 --> 01:09:29,476
Of course, but it's up to you and me
to set an example...

1011
01:09:29,636 --> 01:09:32,997
...tonight, in togetherness.

1012
01:09:42,078 --> 01:09:43,797
There's rain coming in our room.

1013
01:09:43,957 --> 01:09:46,278
- Can we sleep here?
- Please?

1014
01:09:52,518 --> 01:09:55,599
Hey. I'm not gonna sleep
in that big room all alone...

1015
01:09:55,759 --> 01:09:57,838
...if I'm not even sick.

1016
01:10:11,159 --> 01:10:12,719
Togetherness.

1017
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,600
<i>Every morning at four bells,
our day began.</i>

1018
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:21,440
<i>After all, running a family
of 18 children isn't simple...</i>

1019
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:25,159
<i>...but it can be done.
The secret is organisation.</i>

1020
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:28,039
<i>A job for everyone
and everyone on the job.</i>

1021
01:10:28,199 --> 01:10:31,280
<i>I was always the first one
to spring into action.</i>

1022
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:46,801
<i>Mutiny was simply not tolerated.
My crew grumbled but obeyed.</i>

1023
01:10:46,962 --> 01:10:50,122
<i>They knew their captain only did what
was best for all.</i>

1024
01:10:50,282 --> 01:10:53,721
<i>Up anchor, man the mizzen,
fire when ready.</i>

1025
01:11:01,082 --> 01:11:02,921
<i>Mission accomplished.</i>

1026
01:11:04,842 --> 01:11:07,122
<i>Tommy's job was to check
the weather report...</i>

1027
01:11:07,282 --> 01:11:09,603
<i>...to determine
the uniform of the day.</i>

1028
01:11:09,762 --> 01:11:11,923
Twenty percent chance of rain.

1029
01:11:15,443 --> 01:11:17,923
<i>My job was to brush my teeth.</i>

1030
01:11:19,444 --> 01:11:21,403
<i>It wasn't easy.</i>

1031
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:45,805
<i>Maybe if he'd helped me sooner,
they wouldn't be falling out.</i>

1032
01:11:46,485 --> 01:11:49,444
<i>Even without teeth,
breakfast at the Beardsleys' included...</i>

1033
01:11:49,604 --> 01:11:51,444
<i>...5 pounds of bacon...</i>

1034
01:11:52,525 --> 01:11:54,525
<i>...2 gallons of oatmeal...</i>

1035
01:11:55,086 --> 01:11:56,805
<i>...three dozen eggs...</i>

1036
01:12:02,206 --> 01:12:05,445
<i>...and 40 pieces of toast,
unless I missed.</i>

1037
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:09,806
<i>And that was only to hold them
until lunch.</i>

1038
01:12:10,006 --> 01:12:12,606
<i>Which they couldn't prepare
without the old skipper.</i>

1039
01:12:12,766 --> 01:12:17,447
<i>After 20 happy years in the Navy,
I had at least learned how to deal.</i>

1040
01:12:40,768 --> 01:12:45,009
<i>Breakfast was the best meal of the day,
if you had long arms.</i>

1041
01:12:45,809 --> 01:12:48,889
<i>I don't care much for eggs anyway.</i>

1042
01:12:53,208 --> 01:12:56,970
<i>And I can live without bacon
if I have to.</i>

1043
01:12:57,729 --> 01:13:00,048
<i>Although some people are pigs
about it.</i>

1044
01:13:02,769 --> 01:13:06,010
<i>But if a fellow can't even have a piece
of toast, he's finished.</i>

1045
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:08,329
<i>I could starve to death
right at this table...</i>

1046
01:13:08,489 --> 01:13:10,649
<i>...and nobody would even stop eating.</i>

1047
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:15,610
- School bus is coming.
- Get your rain boots on!

1048
01:13:22,091 --> 01:13:25,251
Phillip, stop dawdling.
Now, come on, dear.

1049
01:13:25,411 --> 01:13:29,652
<i>There was nothing else to do.
I had to invent the oatmeal sandwich.</i>

1050
01:13:31,171 --> 01:13:32,451
Come on, Phillip.

1051
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:35,372
<i>This is where my system proved
so valuable.</i>

1052
01:13:35,532 --> 01:13:39,492
<i>The rain boots were all in one closet,
where they could be reached instantly.</i>

1053
01:13:39,652 --> 01:13:43,532
<i>We had learned to buy boots and shoes
and clothes in wholesale lots.</i>

1054
01:13:43,692 --> 01:13:47,052
<i>Sizes didn't matter, because eventually
everything fit everybody.</i>

1055
01:13:48,212 --> 01:13:50,172
<i>Almost everybody.</i>

1056
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:07,132
Don't worry, fella, just keep growing.

1057
01:14:07,292 --> 01:14:09,493
Someday you can fill my boots.

1058
01:14:13,613 --> 01:14:15,332
That's my brother.

1059
01:14:31,534 --> 01:14:35,095
We got some wild things planned.
You've gotta come. It'll be out of sight.

1060
01:14:35,255 --> 01:14:37,215
- Hi, Larry.
- Hey.

1061
01:14:38,175 --> 01:14:41,095
The gang is throwing a freak-out
tonight at the beach house.

1062
01:14:41,255 --> 01:14:43,614
Tell your parents we're going
to a movie.

1063
01:14:43,774 --> 01:14:45,055
Oh, Larry, I couldn't.

1064
01:14:45,255 --> 01:14:48,534
Here we go again. Why not?

1065
01:14:48,735 --> 01:14:52,136
- I heard about those parties.
- I can't wait to find out if it's true.

1066
01:14:52,336 --> 01:14:54,095
Well, I'm not going.

1067
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:56,496
- You are unbelievable.
- I am?

1068
01:14:56,655 --> 01:14:58,456
It's that ridiculous family of yours.

1069
01:14:58,617 --> 01:15:01,216
You're medieval.
You're so hung up, it's pathetic.

1070
01:15:01,377 --> 01:15:03,176
Do you know what you are?
A sex maniac.

1071
01:15:03,377 --> 01:15:07,617
If I'm a sex maniac, I'm the most
frustrated sex maniac in the world.

1072
01:15:07,777 --> 01:15:11,176
- And I'm almost out of high school!
- Big deal!

1073
01:15:19,618 --> 01:15:21,737
That's fine. All right, children...

1074
01:15:21,898 --> 01:15:25,618
...finish up your problems
and bring in your papers.

1075
01:15:32,898 --> 01:15:37,698
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Phillip.

1076
01:15:38,859 --> 01:15:40,939
You didn't sign your paper properly.

1077
01:15:41,139 --> 01:15:44,099
- Your name is Phillip North.
- I'm Phillip Beardsley.

1078
01:15:44,259 --> 01:15:46,659
We all went to church
and we were all married.

1079
01:15:46,819 --> 01:15:49,979
- I'm Phillip Beardsley.
- No, dear, not legally...

1080
01:15:50,139 --> 01:15:53,859
...and we must sign our legal names
in school, mustn't we?

1081
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:56,659
- Beardsley.
- No, dear, North.

1082
01:15:56,819 --> 01:16:00,300
- North! North! North!
- Beardsley! Beardsley! Beardsley!

1083
01:16:22,462 --> 01:16:25,661
I got here as fast as I could,
Sister Mary. What is it this time?

1084
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:27,502
Why don't you ask Phillip.

1085
01:16:29,101 --> 01:16:30,502
Phillip.

1086
01:16:32,862 --> 01:16:35,622
- Darling, what happened?
- Nothing.

1087
01:16:35,783 --> 01:16:38,582
- Who did that to you?
- One of the kids.

1088
01:16:38,742 --> 01:16:40,542
She started it.

1089
01:16:40,983 --> 01:16:44,262
- She says I'm not legal.
- What?

1090
01:16:44,462 --> 01:16:48,382
- And Mike isn't my brother.
- Of course he's your brother.

1091
01:16:48,542 --> 01:16:51,423
- Then my name is Phillip Beardsley.
- Phillip North.

1092
01:16:52,582 --> 01:16:54,542
There she goes again.

1093
01:16:57,063 --> 01:17:01,503
Sister, couldn't you just call him
Phillip Beardsley?

1094
01:17:01,703 --> 01:17:05,944
I'm sorry, but the school requires
that we use their legal names.

1095
01:17:06,144 --> 01:17:08,104
Let's go to another school.

1096
01:17:09,783 --> 01:17:14,585
I understand your legal problem,
but you must try to understand mine.

1097
01:17:14,744 --> 01:17:19,024
You see, I'm trying to bring
two families together...

1098
01:17:20,024 --> 01:17:24,024
...and this is the first sign
that I may be succeeding.

1099
01:17:24,185 --> 01:17:27,824
I really would appreciate it if you'd let
Phillip sign his name Beardsley.

1100
01:17:28,025 --> 01:17:30,265
But legally it's North.

1101
01:17:31,784 --> 01:17:35,586
But it's more important
that emotionally it's Beardsley.

1102
01:17:36,386 --> 01:17:38,305
North.

1103
01:17:38,466 --> 01:17:41,105
- Beardsley.
- North.

1104
01:17:41,706 --> 01:17:44,666
Beardsley! Beardsley! Beardsley!

1105
01:17:44,865 --> 01:17:46,827
Watch out, Mom.
You might get a black eye.

1106
01:17:51,546 --> 01:17:54,867
You mean, I adopt your children
and you want to adopt mine?

1107
01:17:55,027 --> 01:17:58,106
Yes, that way we'll really be
one family.

1108
01:17:58,747 --> 01:18:01,228
Your children will have a mother,
legally...

1109
01:18:01,386 --> 01:18:05,347
...and mine will have a father, legally.
That way they'll be protected.

1110
01:18:05,506 --> 01:18:09,587
You know, in case anything should
happen to either one of us.

1111
01:18:13,787 --> 01:18:16,307
- Strawberry or raspberry?
- Apricot.

1112
01:18:16,507 --> 01:18:21,068
Do you know that in California
it costs $250 just to adopt one child?

1113
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:23,747
- Really?
- That's a lot of money for a formality.

1114
01:18:23,948 --> 01:18:26,309
A black eye isn't a formality.

1115
01:18:28,708 --> 01:18:30,668
- How much milk?
- Twenty quarts.

1116
01:18:30,908 --> 01:18:33,948
Sixteen, 18, 20.

1117
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:36,109
What we ought to adopt is a cow.

1118
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:40,109
These are for Dad.

1119
01:18:50,069 --> 01:18:53,149
Two hundred and fifty times 18
is $4500.

1120
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:56,989
- How did you figure that out so fast?
- Sheer panic.

1121
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:58,869
Well, hello, Mr. Beardsley.

1122
01:18:59,029 --> 01:19:01,069
Should I wrap it,
or you gonna eat it here?

1123
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:03,911
All right, Harry,
just call out the reserves.

1124
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:07,350
Dave, Jack, it's an emergency.
The Beardsleys are here. More boxes.

1125
01:19:07,551 --> 01:19:10,591
Frank, you know what I'd like
for Christmas?

1126
01:19:10,751 --> 01:19:12,310
- What?
- Don't buy me anything.

1127
01:19:12,952 --> 01:19:15,551
The most expensive gift in the world
is when a wife says:

1128
01:19:15,712 --> 01:19:18,952
- " Don't buy me anything. "
- Look, if we didn't...

1129
01:19:19,112 --> 01:19:22,671
...give each other Christmas gifts,
and if we didn't get the new car...

1130
01:19:22,832 --> 01:19:25,112
...and we cut down
on all the little things...

1131
01:19:25,271 --> 01:19:29,033
...the things we don't really need,
the little luxuries...

1132
01:19:29,192 --> 01:19:31,792
...couldn't we afford to
adopt our kids?

1133
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:42,073
Thank you, Dad. Would you put these
back there, please?

1134
01:19:59,833 --> 01:20:02,354
- Is that it?
- That's it.

1135
01:20:11,715 --> 01:20:13,234
Would you care to check it?

1136
01:20:19,114 --> 01:20:22,076
How could you decide something
like that without asking us?

1137
01:20:22,715 --> 01:20:25,994
Colleen, we thought you children
would be happy to be adopted.

1138
01:20:26,195 --> 01:20:28,636
Happy to forget
our real father's name?

1139
01:20:28,796 --> 01:20:32,475
- Get lost in a jungle full of Beardsleys?
- Now, just a minute.

1140
01:20:32,676 --> 01:20:35,756
Mother, that's the most awful thing
I've ever heard.

1141
01:20:35,916 --> 01:20:38,315
He's gone a year,
and you're trying to wipe him...

1142
01:20:38,475 --> 01:20:40,596
...out of your life
as if he never existed.

1143
01:20:41,195 --> 01:20:43,395
And I thought you loved him.

1144
01:20:56,037 --> 01:20:58,557
- I like Beardsley.
- You be quiet!

1145
01:20:58,717 --> 01:21:02,438
- And no, I don't want any dessert.
- I'll take his.

1146
01:21:05,597 --> 01:21:08,438
Sorry, I didn't think I was
committing a federal offence.

1147
01:21:08,599 --> 01:21:10,519
Thought they'd want me for a father.

1148
01:21:10,717 --> 01:21:12,917
Yeah, well, now you know
what they think of you.

1149
01:21:13,078 --> 01:21:15,518
Stay out of it.
It's their problem.

1150
01:21:15,719 --> 01:21:18,759
Now, wait a minute, Rosemary.
It's not just their problem.

1151
01:21:18,917 --> 01:21:21,759
I was planning on adopting
all you children too.

1152
01:21:21,958 --> 01:21:24,078
- Was that part of the deal?
- Yes.

1153
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:28,079
I thought everybody understood that.
We want this to be one family.

1154
01:21:29,399 --> 01:21:30,920
Excuse me.

1155
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:35,920
- What's the matter with him?
- What do you think?

1156
01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:37,520
I gotta do my homework.

1157
01:21:39,239 --> 01:21:42,081
Homework? He's really shook.

1158
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,121
Why shouldn't he be?

1159
01:21:44,319 --> 01:21:47,801
We loved our mother just as much
as they loved their father.

1160
01:21:47,961 --> 01:21:49,800
I know that, Rosemary.

1161
01:21:50,001 --> 01:21:52,161
And now you're asking us
to bury her again?

1162
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,961
Who's getting buried?

1163
01:21:54,801 --> 01:21:58,600
- Come on, we'll get you washed.
- Excuse me.

1164
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:02,600
I can't eat if everybody's gonna cry!

1165
01:22:07,162 --> 01:22:10,122
Frank, how could we have been
so wrong?

1166
01:22:10,282 --> 01:22:13,643
- I feel like a murderer.
- Merry Christmas, everybody!

1167
01:22:15,122 --> 01:22:17,521
Merry, merry, merry...

1168
01:22:20,962 --> 01:22:22,561
Merry.

1169
01:22:23,483 --> 01:22:24,962
What a let- down.

1170
01:22:25,322 --> 01:22:28,322
I walked in here,
full of the old Christmas spirit...

1171
01:22:28,483 --> 01:22:31,283
...ready to tell you the good news,
and it's a disaster area.

1172
01:22:31,443 --> 01:22:33,842
What's the good news?
I could use some right now.

1173
01:22:34,002 --> 01:22:35,802
- Didn't Frank tell you?
- No.

1174
01:22:35,963 --> 01:22:38,043
Didn't you know you married Edison,
the man?

1175
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:40,644
- I am?
- That Fresnel- lens landing system...

1176
01:22:40,804 --> 01:22:43,563
...Frank and I worked on
has been accepted by the Navy.

1177
01:22:43,724 --> 01:22:46,884
- Frank, that's wonderful!
- It's only been accepted for testing.

1178
01:22:47,043 --> 01:22:49,323
Well, it's going on shake- down
on the Big E.

1179
01:22:49,484 --> 01:22:51,765
- Hey, that's cool.
- When are you taking it out?

1180
01:22:51,923 --> 01:22:53,484
I'm not taking it out.

1181
01:22:53,645 --> 01:22:57,163
Since your father is anchored here,
I volunteered to handle it for him.

1182
01:22:57,364 --> 01:22:59,604
But, Dad,
how come you're not taking it out?

1183
01:22:59,765 --> 01:23:02,725
It just might be I felt it wasn't right
to leave my family.

1184
01:23:03,725 --> 01:23:06,085
But a shake- down,
that's only a couple of weeks.

1185
01:23:06,564 --> 01:23:08,005
You always used to.

1186
01:23:08,206 --> 01:23:10,885
- Well, things are a little different now.
- That stinks.

1187
01:23:11,045 --> 01:23:13,885
- That really stinks.
- I'd rather not talk about it, okay?

1188
01:23:15,725 --> 01:23:17,605
Big mouth.

1189
01:23:20,565 --> 01:23:23,525
- Frank.
- You really sank the Navy, didn't you?

1190
01:23:37,766 --> 01:23:39,487
- Frank.
- Yeah?

1191
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:42,447
You really do wanna go to sea again,
don't you?

1192
01:23:43,328 --> 01:23:47,087
I'm not going to pretend.
There's no halo on me.

1193
01:23:47,247 --> 01:23:49,648
Sure, I suppose I'm a little envious
of Darrell.

1194
01:23:49,806 --> 01:23:54,328
But when I signed on for this cruise,
I knew it was for the duration.

1195
01:23:54,608 --> 01:23:57,768
You make me feel
as if I'm World War III.

1196
01:23:57,927 --> 01:23:59,287
Well, you shouldn't.

1197
01:24:00,328 --> 01:24:03,568
Helen, I want you to know something,
if you don't already know it.

1198
01:24:03,729 --> 01:24:06,328
I'm happier than I've ever been
in my life.

1199
01:24:06,488 --> 01:24:08,929
I've already gotten
what I want for Christmas.

1200
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:10,569
Thank you.

1201
01:24:12,088 --> 01:24:15,529
- I'm glad you adopted me.
- So am I.

1202
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:33,850
He's been here! He's been here!
Santa Claus has been here!

1203
01:24:34,010 --> 01:24:36,411
Santa Claus has been here.
Santa Claus has been here.

1204
01:24:36,570 --> 01:24:40,170
Santa Claus has been here.
Santa Claus has been here.

1205
01:24:40,331 --> 01:24:42,091
- Santa Claus!
- Let me out!

1206
01:24:42,251 --> 01:24:44,930
Get out!
Let me get to the Christmas tree!

1207
01:24:45,091 --> 01:24:47,291
Let me out!
I wanna get to the Christmas tree!

1208
01:24:57,131 --> 01:25:00,971
Frank! Frank, where are you?
You're missing Christmas!

1209
01:25:01,532 --> 01:25:02,931
Frank!

1210
01:25:05,092 --> 01:25:07,851
Frank! Where are you?
You're missing everything.

1211
01:25:10,612 --> 01:25:13,172
Frank, you're missing it!
Where are you?

1212
01:25:20,372 --> 01:25:22,533
Frank, what are you doing in here?

1213
01:25:22,693 --> 01:25:25,733
- I'm an elf.
- But you haven't been to bed at all.

1214
01:25:25,893 --> 01:25:29,493
I've had six scooters, three wagons,
a fire engine. This is the last bicycle.

1215
01:25:29,654 --> 01:25:32,774
- General Motors couldn't have kept up.
- Well, hurry up, dear.

1216
01:25:35,054 --> 01:25:37,533
Does anybody know where
the package is for your dad?

1217
01:25:37,694 --> 01:25:40,094
- The red- and-white package.
- Here it is!

1218
01:25:40,253 --> 01:25:43,774
- Oh, thank you, darling. Thank you.
- Hey, what do you know?

1219
01:25:43,934 --> 01:25:47,253
Santa Claus brought so many presents
he had to leave some in the closet.

1220
01:25:47,414 --> 01:25:49,694
Does it have my name on it?
For Phillip North?

1221
01:25:49,854 --> 01:25:52,454
I wrote him my legal name.
I didn't want any trouble.

1222
01:25:52,614 --> 01:25:54,734
Let's see, it says
" Phillip North Beardsley. "

1223
01:25:54,895 --> 01:25:58,135
- That takes care of the situation.
- Oh, boy!

1224
01:26:04,336 --> 01:26:06,895
It had my name on it, all right.

1225
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:09,775
We'll get an elf over here
to fix it up. Greg.

1226
01:26:09,935 --> 01:26:12,296
Get off it, darling. He'll fix it.

1227
01:26:13,216 --> 01:26:15,216
- You're not an elf.
- Well, I'm practising.

1228
01:26:15,376 --> 01:26:16,895
All right, come on.

1229
01:26:18,815 --> 01:26:21,815
Frank, this is for you.

1230
01:26:24,577 --> 01:26:26,016
Well, go ahead, open it.

1231
01:26:26,176 --> 01:26:30,056
- Mommy, look what I got!
- That's beautiful, darling.

1232
01:26:43,018 --> 01:26:46,177
Susan, don't eat the ornaments
off the tree until later.

1233
01:26:46,338 --> 01:26:49,338
I think Santa Claus made a mistake.
Maybe this is for Tommy, huh?

1234
01:26:49,497 --> 01:26:52,018
No, dear, I think this is for you.

1235
01:26:53,938 --> 01:26:56,377
- I don't get it.
- Bon voyage.

1236
01:26:56,538 --> 01:26:57,939
What are you talking about?

1237
01:26:58,099 --> 01:27:01,378
Everybody else got what they really
wanted for Christmas. Why not you?

1238
01:27:01,538 --> 01:27:03,979
- Dad can go on the Enterprise?
- That's great!

1239
01:27:04,139 --> 01:27:07,139
Just a minute. Did it ever occur
to anybody that I might know...

1240
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:11,100
...where my duty lies and prefer
to stay here, look after my family...?

1241
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:14,020
Complain for a few more minutes,
dear, before you agree.

1242
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:16,539
I'm gonna answer the phone.

1243
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:20,779
- If she thinks I have any intention of...
- How long?

1244
01:27:20,939 --> 01:27:22,699
About six weeks.

1245
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:27,140
Well, when are we gonna sing
Christmas carols, huh?

1246
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:33,301
Doctor, this is Christmas,
not April Fool. Are you sure?

1247
01:27:33,461 --> 01:27:37,180
My dear Mrs. Beardsley, the reason
I am in my office on Christmas Day...

1248
01:27:37,341 --> 01:27:40,341
...is because I wanted
to check the lab report personally.

1249
01:27:40,502 --> 01:27:44,501
You do not have indigestion,
ileitis or diverticulitis.

1250
01:27:44,661 --> 01:27:47,622
<i>What you have is a simple case
of pregnancy.</i>

1251
01:27:47,782 --> 01:27:49,502
<i>P-R-E-G...</i>

1252
01:27:49,662 --> 01:27:52,662
Doctor, if anybody knows
how to spell it, I do.

1253
01:27:53,782 --> 01:27:56,582
- Thanks for calling.
- Merry Christmas.

1254
01:28:11,104 --> 01:28:13,743
- Who was it?
- Wrong number.

1255
01:28:53,905 --> 01:28:56,385
<i>And so the skipper
went back to sea...</i>

1256
01:28:56,546 --> 01:28:59,225
<i>...protesting until the ship
was out of hearing.</i>

1257
01:29:02,466 --> 01:29:05,345
<i>Darling, always the same,
days speed by...</i>

1258
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:07,786
<i>...but the nights go very slowly.</i>

1259
01:29:07,945 --> 01:29:11,827
<i>You missed a wonderful day today.
Susan stopped eating.</i>

1260
01:29:11,987 --> 01:29:16,627
<i>A boy invited her to her first dance,
and she insisted on buying this dress.</i>

1261
01:29:16,787 --> 01:29:18,386
<i>As you can see by the picture...</i>

1262
01:29:18,546 --> 01:29:21,546
<i>...she's still got a few pounds
to go before Saturday night.</i>

1263
01:29:21,707 --> 01:29:24,426
<i>Oh, what we girls go through
for our men.</i>

1264
01:29:33,188 --> 01:29:34,667
<i>Dearest mother of 18:</i>

1265
01:29:34,828 --> 01:29:38,948
<i>Military security being what it is,
I can't tell you where we are...</i>

1266
01:29:39,108 --> 01:29:41,588
<i>...but the enclosed photograph
of Darrell and me...</i>

1267
01:29:41,748 --> 01:29:44,908
<i>...may give you some idea.
I'm the sexy one.</i>

1268
01:29:46,747 --> 01:29:49,628
<i>Mike's letter was from the president
of the United States.</i>

1269
01:29:49,788 --> 01:29:52,149
<i>It said, "Greetings..."</i>

1270
01:29:55,470 --> 01:29:58,588
Deep breath. Hold it. Exhale.

1271
01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:00,229
That's fine, son. Name.

1272
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:02,389
- Michael Francis Beardsley.
- Hello, Mike.

1273
01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:04,869
Hi, doc. What are you doing
at the draft board?

1274
01:30:05,029 --> 01:30:07,510
Sacrificing one afternoon a week
for my country.

1275
01:30:07,670 --> 01:30:10,189
- How's your mother feeling?
- You mean my stepmother.

1276
01:30:10,350 --> 01:30:12,149
She's fine, I guess.

1277
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:17,630
- No morning sickness?
- No, doc, I feel fine.

1278
01:30:18,110 --> 01:30:19,510
Not you, your mother.

1279
01:30:19,711 --> 01:30:23,150
Now, why should she have...?
Morning sickness!

1280
01:30:23,871 --> 01:30:27,230
- We need a sample of your blood.
- Take it all.

1281
01:30:30,631 --> 01:30:33,150
Hi, Mike.
How did the physical go?

1282
01:30:33,311 --> 01:30:36,270
Well, they took inventory.
I had enough parts.

1283
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:39,752
Mike, how do you really feel
about the whole thing?

1284
01:30:40,431 --> 01:30:42,391
Yeah, I understand.

1285
01:30:44,792 --> 01:30:46,591
Where are the girls?
Should you do that?

1286
01:30:46,752 --> 01:30:48,912
Why shouldn't I?
What's the matter with you?

1287
01:30:49,072 --> 01:30:52,632
Nothing with me, but I think
you're out of your mind.

1288
01:30:54,193 --> 01:30:55,552
Does it show that much?

1289
01:30:55,712 --> 01:30:58,193
No, but guess who the doctor was
at the draft board.

1290
01:30:58,353 --> 01:31:01,353
Oh, I ought to report him
to the Medical Association.

1291
01:31:01,512 --> 01:31:03,472
No, he's gonna report you.

1292
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:07,234
Bring that over for me, will you?

1293
01:31:11,073 --> 01:31:13,873
You knew about it Christmas Day,
didn't you?

1294
01:31:14,314 --> 01:31:17,154
- And you still let Dad ship out?
- Yes.

1295
01:31:17,314 --> 01:31:18,634
Why?

1296
01:31:18,793 --> 01:31:20,795
He wanted so much to go.

1297
01:31:20,954 --> 01:31:24,475
Two people can't live with an ocean
between them for the rest of their lives.

1298
01:31:24,635 --> 01:31:28,154
- If you write him about it, I'll shoot you.
- You would, too.

1299
01:31:28,314 --> 01:31:31,274
I'd just as soon he didn't know
about this draft thing either.

1300
01:31:31,435 --> 01:31:33,354
Why not? Can't we tell him anything?

1301
01:31:33,515 --> 01:31:37,755
No, I'm thinking about the Marines.
That would drive him out of his skull.

1302
01:31:37,914 --> 01:31:39,195
Okay.

1303
01:31:40,555 --> 01:31:44,876
- Do you really want this baby?
- Very much.

1304
01:31:45,076 --> 01:31:49,074
You see, he won't have to worry
whether he's a Beardsley or a North.

1305
01:31:54,475 --> 01:31:57,556
<i>The Navy, like a woman,
has a way of changing its mind.</i>

1306
01:31:57,716 --> 01:32:02,197
<i>Our short cruise was extended
so often, we lost all track of time...</i>

1307
01:32:02,356 --> 01:32:06,277
<i>...until one day when the mail plane
caught up with us.</i>

1308
01:32:13,078 --> 01:32:15,637
- Darrell, we're pregnant!
- We're what?

1309
01:32:15,797 --> 01:32:18,436
Mike's letter! Helen and I,
we're gonna have a baby.

1310
01:32:18,637 --> 01:32:20,398
- Our first.
- Your first? Wait a minute.

1311
01:32:20,557 --> 01:32:23,398
You can't even count. No wonder
it happened. When is she due?

1312
01:32:23,557 --> 01:32:25,957
When is she due?
The idiot, he doesn't say.

1313
01:32:26,118 --> 01:32:28,078
- Oh, no.
- Let me read Helen's letter again.

1314
01:32:28,238 --> 01:32:30,479
- Open some of those for me.
- Yeah, okay.

1315
01:32:30,637 --> 01:32:32,639
Here's one from Mary.
I can tell by the jam.

1316
01:32:32,798 --> 01:32:35,198
- Helen doesn't mention it.
- Phillip gave you a tooth.

1317
01:32:35,359 --> 01:32:37,279
Thanks. Colleen's in love.

1318
01:32:37,439 --> 01:32:39,998
What, again? Wait a minute.
What are we doing?

1319
01:32:40,158 --> 01:32:43,078
You've had enough training.
Can't you figure out the date?

1320
01:32:43,238 --> 01:32:45,238
It can't be soon.
Helen would've told me.

1321
01:32:45,399 --> 01:32:47,600
Now, maybe she doesn't
tell you everything.

1322
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:51,279
Unless Veronica is an impressionist,
number 19 is about to be launched.

1323
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:58,560
I've gotta get on that mail plane
before it takes off.

1324
01:34:08,644 --> 01:34:12,444
<i>Veronica's artistic endeav our
was not quite accurate.</i>

1325
01:34:12,604 --> 01:34:15,163
<i>A month later, we were still waiting
for the stork.</i>

1326
01:34:15,323 --> 01:34:18,564
<i>Every night we would go to bed
wondering if this were D-day.</i>

1327
01:34:18,765 --> 01:34:21,125
<i>Naturally, Helen was the most
nervous of all...</i>

1328
01:34:21,284 --> 01:34:24,725
<i>...and it was compounded by
the tension about Mike and the draft.</i>

1329
01:34:24,885 --> 01:34:28,885
<i>She kept getting more excitable,
anxious and emotional.</i>

1330
01:34:29,045 --> 01:34:31,404
<i>Why can't a woman be more
like a man?</i>

1331
01:34:33,045 --> 01:34:34,485
- Frank?
- What?

1332
01:34:34,645 --> 01:34:37,125
Don't make so much noise,
you'll wake the children.

1333
01:34:37,286 --> 01:34:39,485
I just want a glass of water.

1334
01:34:41,525 --> 01:34:44,367
- Why are you making that terrible face?
- I have indigestion.

1335
01:34:44,525 --> 01:34:46,326
How often do you have
that indigestion?

1336
01:34:46,485 --> 01:34:48,567
- About every 15 minutes.
- That's it!

1337
01:34:48,726 --> 01:34:50,565
Stay calm. Everything's organised.

1338
01:34:53,287 --> 01:34:55,846
Don't worry, everything's...
I've laid it all on.

1339
01:34:56,006 --> 01:34:58,447
Don't rush, now, Frank. I'm all right.

1340
01:34:58,606 --> 01:35:01,407
- There's plenty of time, but hurry!
- We'll get you there.

1341
01:35:07,127 --> 01:35:08,768
Stay calm.

1342
01:35:08,927 --> 01:35:11,247
Red alert! Red alert!

1343
01:35:11,448 --> 01:35:13,967
Red alert! Red alert!

1344
01:35:17,368 --> 01:35:19,889
Mike! Get the car out of the garage
and warm it up.

1345
01:35:20,047 --> 01:35:22,729
- Nicky, get her bag, quickly.
- We've done this before.

1346
01:35:22,889 --> 01:35:24,167
Rosemary, Louise, Tommy...

1347
01:35:24,328 --> 01:35:26,609
...get blankets and pillows
for the station wagon.

1348
01:35:26,768 --> 01:35:29,168
- Phillip, what are you doing?
- Going to the bathroom.

1349
01:35:29,328 --> 01:35:32,128
- What, is the stork coming?
- Maybe a whole flock of storks.

1350
01:35:32,288 --> 01:35:34,128
I never thought of that.

1351
01:35:34,368 --> 01:35:37,050
- Hey, Mike! What...?
- What's happened?

1352
01:35:37,208 --> 01:35:39,649
Hey, stop it! Hey, Mike!

1353
01:35:40,208 --> 01:35:41,609
What is this?

1354
01:35:42,128 --> 01:35:44,489
Will you knock it off. Now, listen...

1355
01:35:44,649 --> 01:35:48,810
Larry, what are you...? Mike! Break
it up. Knock it off. What is all this?

1356
01:35:48,970 --> 01:35:51,010
Larry, why are you in our house
at this hour?

1357
01:35:51,171 --> 01:35:53,409
- Dad, Mom wants you right away.
- Get the car.

1358
01:35:53,569 --> 01:35:57,451
I'm hysterical enough without your
help. What's going on around here?

1359
01:35:57,770 --> 01:36:00,490
Nothing. That's the whole problem
with your daughter.

1360
01:36:00,690 --> 01:36:05,530
Mike! Will you cut it out.
Look at you. You two, are you crazy?

1361
01:36:05,690 --> 01:36:07,690
My bike!

1362
01:36:07,850 --> 01:36:09,490
You all right?

1363
01:36:13,011 --> 01:36:15,452
What happened? Hey, man,
don't you know how to drive?

1364
01:36:15,610 --> 01:36:18,292
- Look what you did to my bike.
- My mother's having a baby.

1365
01:36:18,452 --> 01:36:21,252
The bike's jammed under the car.
We may never get it loose.

1366
01:36:21,412 --> 01:36:25,052
Dad! Mom said they're coming
six minutes apart!

1367
01:36:25,252 --> 01:36:28,252
- What are we gonna do?
- Get a crowbar and pry it loose.

1368
01:36:28,412 --> 01:36:31,332
- What?
- Not you!

1369
01:36:34,412 --> 01:36:37,332
- Daddy, can I go to bed now?
- Of course.

1370
01:36:37,493 --> 01:36:40,813
Please, I can't talk to Mother right now.
I've got to talk to somebody.

1371
01:36:40,974 --> 01:36:42,333
Well, talk fast.

1372
01:36:42,493 --> 01:36:45,894
Well, Larry says he'll never speak
to me again unless I grow up.

1373
01:36:46,052 --> 01:36:49,293
He says I'm being ridiculous,
and I don't love him. But I do love him.

1374
01:36:49,453 --> 01:36:51,734
- Am I ridiculous?
- You're not being ridiculous.

1375
01:36:51,894 --> 01:36:54,293
Well, do all the other girls,
like Larry says?

1376
01:36:54,453 --> 01:36:56,094
And am I just being old-fashioned?

1377
01:36:56,293 --> 01:36:59,413
The same idiots were passing
the same rumours when I was your age.

1378
01:36:59,654 --> 01:37:02,814
If all girls did, how come I always
ended up with ones who didn't?

1379
01:37:02,974 --> 01:37:04,333
But it's all different now.

1380
01:37:04,493 --> 01:37:07,854
They wrote Fanny Hill in 1742, and they
haven't found anything new since.

1381
01:37:08,014 --> 01:37:11,774
- Who's Fanny Hill?
- Go to bed, that's who Fanny Hill is.

1382
01:37:14,055 --> 01:37:17,015
- Ready, honey?
- Thank you, dear. Oh, boy, am I ready.

1383
01:37:17,176 --> 01:37:19,734
Frank, I think maybe you're
gonna have to help me.

1384
01:37:19,895 --> 01:37:22,216
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right, dear.

1385
01:37:24,296 --> 01:37:27,296
I know this is a terrible time
to talk about it, but Larry said...

1386
01:37:27,456 --> 01:37:30,735
I've got a message for Larry.
You tell him this is what it's all about.

1387
01:37:30,895 --> 01:37:33,216
- This is the real happening.
- Come on, Tommy.

1388
01:37:33,376 --> 01:37:36,296
If you wanna know what love really is,
take a look around you.

1389
01:37:36,456 --> 01:37:39,055
- What are you talking about?
- Take a look at your mother.

1390
01:37:39,216 --> 01:37:40,617
- Not now.
- Yes, now.

1391
01:37:40,777 --> 01:37:42,497
It's giving life that counts.

1392
01:37:42,657 --> 01:37:45,176
Till you're ready for it,
the rest is just a big fraud.

1393
01:37:45,337 --> 01:37:48,777
All the crazy haircuts in the world
won't keep it turning.

1394
01:37:48,976 --> 01:37:52,096
Life isn't a love- in, it's the dishes
and the orthodontist...

1395
01:37:52,256 --> 01:37:54,057
...and the shoe repairman...

1396
01:37:54,217 --> 01:37:56,337
...and ground round
instead of roast beef.

1397
01:37:56,497 --> 01:37:57,817
I'll tell you something else.

1398
01:37:57,978 --> 01:38:00,177
Going to bed with a man
doesn't prove your love.

1399
01:38:00,337 --> 01:38:03,457
It's getting up in the morning
and facing the drab, miserable...

1400
01:38:03,618 --> 01:38:05,938
...wonderful everyday world
with him that counts.

1401
01:38:06,097 --> 01:38:07,898
- Are you all right, Mother?
- Yes, dear.

1402
01:38:08,059 --> 01:38:11,059
- Now, you kids get back to bed. Go on.
- Go to bed.

1403
01:38:11,219 --> 01:38:13,978
- Good night, Mommy.
- Bye, Mommy. Bye.

1404
01:38:15,618 --> 01:38:17,219
You all right?

1405
01:38:17,658 --> 01:38:20,939
I suppose having 19 kids
is carrying it a bit too far.

1406
01:38:21,099 --> 01:38:24,219
But if we had it to do over,
who would we skip? You?

1407
01:38:24,859 --> 01:38:28,220
- All together, now. One, two, three!
- Come on, this is light.

1408
01:38:28,378 --> 01:38:30,738
- You got it out?
- God, that's a heavy bike.

1409
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:33,458
- Okay, we got it out, Dad.
- Take it easy.

1410
01:38:33,618 --> 01:38:35,220
I'll get your legs.

1411
01:38:37,539 --> 01:38:41,140
Thank you, Frank. I never quite knew
how to explain it to her.

1412
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:45,420
If we don't get you to the hospital fast,
the rest of it will be explained here.

1413
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:54,341
See you later, Dad.

1414
01:38:57,181 --> 01:39:01,220
- Where's he going?
- Hey, Dad, the hospital is that way!

1415
01:39:08,141 --> 01:39:09,462
- Bye!
- Bye!

1416
01:39:14,021 --> 01:39:16,662
You'd think that was their first one.

1417
01:39:17,141 --> 01:39:20,342
Why don't you get a haircut!

1418
01:39:23,822 --> 01:39:27,222
Oh, I'm sorry, Frank,
I'll ask the nurse.

1419
01:39:27,382 --> 01:39:30,462
- They won't let the children in.
- I told you, hospital rules.

1420
01:39:30,622 --> 01:39:33,023
Could you hold him up
to the window so they can see?

1421
01:39:33,182 --> 01:39:36,143
- My husband says they're waiting.
- Of course.

1422
01:39:38,903 --> 01:39:40,344
Is my family out there?

1423
01:39:40,783 --> 01:39:43,823
Not only the family, he must have
brought the whole neighbourhood.

1424
01:39:44,224 --> 01:39:46,384
That neighbourhood is my family.

1425
01:39:47,503 --> 01:39:49,704
Honey, you'd better lie down.

1426
01:39:49,863 --> 01:39:52,344
And if I were you, I wouldn't get up
for three months.

1427
01:39:58,545 --> 01:40:00,345
Is he my brother or your brother?

1428
01:40:00,505 --> 01:40:02,305
He's both our brothers.

1429
01:40:02,465 --> 01:40:06,545
- Even to a nun, like Sister Mary?
- Even to Sister Mary.

1430
01:40:06,706 --> 01:40:09,064
Boy, is he lucky.

1431
01:40:14,666 --> 01:40:17,984
Petitioner Francis Louis Beardsley,
step forward, please.

1432
01:40:24,626 --> 01:40:26,987
You are married to the mother
of these children?

1433
01:40:27,146 --> 01:40:29,386
- Yes, sir.
- Has your wife consented...

1434
01:40:29,546 --> 01:40:33,186
...to adoption of the minor children?
- It was her idea.

1435
01:40:33,386 --> 01:40:35,827
If I'm gonna be adopted,
why can't I talk?

1436
01:40:35,987 --> 01:40:40,146
Don't question the workings
of a democracy, young man.

1437
01:40:40,386 --> 01:40:42,667
At least until you're 7.

1438
01:40:44,667 --> 01:40:47,707
- Has your wife consented?
- Yes, sir.

1439
01:40:48,268 --> 01:40:51,547
Will you execute an agreement
in the presence of the court...

1440
01:40:51,707 --> 01:40:55,547
...that the children shall
be treated in all respects as your...?

1441
01:40:57,469 --> 01:40:59,509
All right. Thank you.

1442
01:41:01,467 --> 01:41:05,269
That the children shall be treated in
every respect as your lawful children...

1443
01:41:05,429 --> 01:41:09,868
...and shall hereafter be known
as Colleen Marie Beardsley...

1444
01:41:10,029 --> 01:41:12,628
...Janette Dean Beardsley...

1445
01:41:12,788 --> 01:41:15,710
...Nicholas Richard Beardsley...

1446
01:41:15,868 --> 01:41:18,430
...Thomas Roderick Beardsley...

1447
01:41:18,590 --> 01:41:21,109
...Jean Louise Beardsley...

1448
01:41:21,270 --> 01:41:24,270
...Phillip Anthony Beardsley...
- I'm legal.

1449
01:41:26,949 --> 01:41:29,670
Gerald Joseph Beardsley...

1450
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:33,069
...and Teresa Rose Beardsley.

1451
01:41:34,710 --> 01:41:38,150
Will you hand these to the clerk,
please? Thank you.

1452
01:41:40,430 --> 01:41:42,230
Helen North Beardsley.

1453
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:44,110
Yes, sir.

1454
01:41:46,751 --> 01:41:49,150
There's been great fear expressed
by many people...

1455
01:41:49,311 --> 01:41:52,671
...that no one woman can give
this large number of children...

1456
01:41:52,831 --> 01:41:54,711
...sufficient attention and affection...

1457
01:41:54,871 --> 01:41:57,271
...to allow them to grow up
in a healthy atmosphere.

1458
01:41:57,471 --> 01:42:01,231
But in this court's investigation of your
home, the reverse seems to be true.

1459
01:42:01,391 --> 01:42:05,311
All the children seem to be happy,
well-fed and normal...

1460
01:42:05,471 --> 01:42:07,752
...the house amazingly clean
and in good order.

1461
01:42:09,231 --> 01:42:12,472
My wife has two children,
one poodle and a full-time maid...

1462
01:42:12,632 --> 01:42:15,313
...and can't seem to manage anything.
What is your secret?

1463
01:42:15,912 --> 01:42:19,313
Well, sir, a great deal of love...

1464
01:42:19,472 --> 01:42:21,472
...a little discipline...

1465
01:42:21,632 --> 01:42:23,873
...and a husband
who doesn't criticise.

1466
01:42:26,712 --> 01:42:29,073
Michael Francis Beardsley...

1467
01:42:29,234 --> 01:42:31,833
...Charles William Beardsley...

1468
01:42:32,354 --> 01:42:36,833
...and so forth and so forth Beardsley.
Will the minors step forward, please?

1469
01:42:40,913 --> 01:42:43,475
- Michael Francis Beardsley, do you...?
- Yes, sir, I do.

1470
01:42:43,635 --> 01:42:45,594
I haven't asked the question yet.

1471
01:42:45,753 --> 01:42:49,074
I leave for Camp Pendleton in an hour.
I was trying to speed things up.

1472
01:42:49,675 --> 01:42:52,074
Besides, it doesn't matter much
what this court does.

1473
01:42:52,234 --> 01:42:54,154
You see, we held our
own meeting yesterday.

1474
01:42:54,314 --> 01:42:57,355
If you're interested in democracy,
Helen North Beardsley...

1475
01:42:57,515 --> 01:43:00,876
...was unanimously elected
our mother, for life.

1476
01:43:01,036 --> 01:43:03,235
Three cheers for
Helen North Beardsley.

1477
01:43:08,475 --> 01:43:10,395
Mommy, pick me up!

1478
01:43:12,916 --> 01:43:14,315
Mommy, pick me up!

1479
01:43:20,476 --> 01:43:22,916
- Oh, here he comes.
- Here he comes.

1480
01:43:25,596 --> 01:43:28,277
Well, let's not get sticky about this.

1481
01:43:28,596 --> 01:43:30,557
Never saw you carry a bag
for your mother.

1482
01:43:30,716 --> 01:43:33,356
- Mom's not in the Marines.
- That's what you think.

1483
01:43:33,516 --> 01:43:37,797
Mike, I know this sounds crazy, but it's
gonna be lonesome around here.

1484
01:43:37,957 --> 01:43:40,037
With this mob?

1485
01:43:41,556 --> 01:43:44,797
Good luck. You sure you don't want
us to drive you to the bus station?

1486
01:43:44,957 --> 01:43:47,398
No, thanks, Dad. I'd rather walk.

1487
01:43:48,358 --> 01:43:49,917
Bye, Mike.

1488
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:54,958
So long, Mike.

1489
01:43:55,118 --> 01:43:57,597
- Now, you take it easy, Phillip.
- Okay.

1490
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:11,800
I don't know what to say.

1491
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:15,079
How about Washington's farewell
to the troops?

1492
01:44:17,039 --> 01:44:19,840
Well, so long.
Don't everybody write at once, huh?

1493
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,801
- So long, Mike.
- Goodbye, Mike.
