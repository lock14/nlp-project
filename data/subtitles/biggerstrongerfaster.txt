1
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:14,868
<i>January 23, 1984.</i>

2
00:00:14,868 --> 00:00:17,440
<i>It was a day that
changed my life forever.</i>

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,012
<i>...The muscle,
the moral courage that built</i>

4
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:22,917
the greatest, freest nation
the world has ever known.

5
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:24,655
<i>Ronald Reagan
was our President</i>

6
00:00:24,655 --> 00:00:26,692
<i>and there was trouble
brewing in Iran.</i>

7
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,428
<i>I was just a kid,</i>

8
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,466
<i>but I knew
who was behind it.</i>

9
00:00:30,468 --> 00:00:32,438
<i>His name was
The Iron Sheik.</i>

10
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,076
<i>From Tehran, Iran,</i>

11
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:38,350
<i>weighing 258 lbs,</i>

12
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,222
<i>The Iron Sheik!</i>

13
00:00:41,223 --> 00:00:43,726
<i>They have a lot of
hate in their hearts for this man.</i>

14
00:00:43,728 --> 00:00:48,637
Iran-- number one!
U.S.A.--

15
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:51,411
<i>You see, Reagan
may have freed the hostages</i>

16
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:54,649
<i>but The Sheik still had
the championship belt.</i>

17
00:00:54,651 --> 00:00:56,588
<i>There was only one man</i>

18
00:00:56,588 --> 00:00:58,591
<i>that could save us.</i>

19
00:00:58,593 --> 00:01:01,731
<i># I am a real
American... #</i>

20
00:01:01,732 --> 00:01:05,138
<i>From Venice
Beach, California,</i>

21
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:10,250
<i>the incredible
Hulk Hogan!</i>

22
00:01:10,251 --> 00:01:12,754
<i>And the
Hulkster rips off that shirt.</i>

23
00:01:12,756 --> 00:01:15,225
<i>But three
minutes into the match</i>

24
00:01:15,227 --> 00:01:18,167
<i>Hulk Hogan was locked in
the dreaded camel clutch.</i>

25
00:01:18,168 --> 00:01:19,835
<i>It's over for the Hulk.</i>

26
00:01:19,837 --> 00:01:22,073
<i>This move would snap
the back of a normal man,</i>

27
00:01:22,075 --> 00:01:24,179
<i>But this wasn't
a normal man.</i>

28
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,781
<i>This was Hulk Hogan</i>

29
00:01:25,783 --> 00:01:28,420
<i>and he was fighting
for our country.</i>

30
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,159
<i>The Hulkster got out
of the camel clutch</i>

31
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:33,031
<i>with the Sheik
on his back,</i>

32
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:34,901
<i>dropped the big leg</i>

33
00:01:34,902 --> 00:01:36,905
<i>and he pinned
the Sheik.</i>

34
00:01:36,906 --> 00:01:39,411
<i>Hulkamania was born
and the message was clear--</i>

35
00:01:39,412 --> 00:01:41,414
<i>You don't mess
with Hulk Hogan</i>

36
00:01:41,415 --> 00:01:43,252
<i>and you certainly
don't mess with America.</i>

37
00:01:48,263 --> 00:01:49,698
I must break you.

38
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,870
<i>Look what
happened to Ivan Drago.</i>

39
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:53,305
<i>He tried to mess
with America</i>

40
00:01:53,307 --> 00:01:55,310
<i>and Rocky
kicked his ass.</i>

41
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:57,615
<i>And then when the Vietnamese
were holding P.O.W.S</i>

42
00:01:57,615 --> 00:02:00,153
<i>Rambo went in and
he kicked their ass.</i>

43
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,156
And in the spirit
of Rambo

44
00:02:02,158 --> 00:02:05,564
<i>let me tell you we're
gonna win this time.</i>

45
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:07,569
<i>Then came
Arnold Schwarzenegger,</i>

46
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:09,306
<i>The ultimate
ass-kicker.</i>

47
00:02:09,306 --> 00:02:12,245
<i>I never saw "Gone With
the Wind" or "Casablanca,"</i>

48
00:02:12,246 --> 00:02:15,318
<i>but I can tell you every
line of every Arnold movie.</i>

49
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:18,324
<i>"Crush your enemies, see
them driven before you</i>

50
00:02:18,324 --> 00:02:20,829
<i>and hear the lamentations
of the women."</i>

51
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:23,534
<i>"Dylan,
you son of a bitch."</i>

52
00:02:23,536 --> 00:02:26,540
<i>And they go bam! And they're all oiled
up and their veins are popping out.</i>

53
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:28,879
<i>I have the power!</i>

54
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:31,718
<i>Better, Stronger, Faster.</i>

55
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,222
<i>I was just 12 years old</i>

56
00:02:33,223 --> 00:02:35,926
<i>and there was an explosion
of ass-kicking in America.</i>

57
00:02:35,927 --> 00:02:37,764
<i>And like
our Olympic athletes</i>

58
00:02:37,764 --> 00:02:39,534
<i>we set our sights
on the stars</i>

59
00:02:39,536 --> 00:02:41,204
and we're going
for the gold.

60
00:02:41,206 --> 00:02:43,743
<i># the eye of the tiger. #</i>

61
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:48,187
<i>I wanted to
tear off my shirt</i>

62
00:02:48,187 --> 00:02:51,225
<i>and be ripped, tanned
and larger than life.</i>

63
00:02:51,227 --> 00:02:52,663
<i>But in reality</i>

64
00:02:52,663 --> 00:02:55,435
<i>I was a fat, pale kid
from Poughkeepsie.</i>

65
00:02:55,436 --> 00:02:57,038
<i>You see, I come from
an overweight family.</i>

66
00:02:57,038 --> 00:02:59,843
<i>My parents were always a
little on the heavy side.</i>

67
00:02:59,844 --> 00:03:01,848
<i>I couldn't ask
for a better mom.</i>

68
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,518
<i>She did everything
for her three boys.</i>

69
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,254
<i>We went to church
three times a week</i>

70
00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:07,293
<i>and she even taught
Sunday school.</i>

71
00:03:07,294 --> 00:03:09,563
<i>My dad was always
there for us too</i>

72
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,836
<i>and he even coached
our little league teams.</i>

73
00:03:12,837 --> 00:03:15,943
<i>I love my dad, but he
was never really my hero.</i>

74
00:03:15,944 --> 00:03:17,981
<i>I didn't want
to be like him.</i>

75
00:03:17,983 --> 00:03:19,551
<i>I wanted to be
like Arnold.</i>

76
00:03:19,552 --> 00:03:22,991
<i>Problem is, I was always
too small, too short.</i>

77
00:03:22,992 --> 00:03:25,764
<i>People would say, "Hey, Little Bell.
What's up, Little Bell?"</i>

78
00:03:25,764 --> 00:03:27,768
<i>And I didn't want
to be Little Bell.</i>

79
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:29,772
<i>I wanted to be
Big Bell.</i>

80
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:32,311
<i>My older brother Mike
was a little chubby</i>

81
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,550
<i>and every morning
when he went to school</i>

82
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,155
<i>he'd get on the bus and the
kids would call him Pugsley.</i>

83
00:03:37,156 --> 00:03:39,026
<i>He didn't like that
too much,</i>

84
00:03:39,026 --> 00:03:41,030
<i>so he beat
some of those kids up.</i>

85
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:44,502
<i>That's where he got
the nickname "Mad Dog."</i>

86
00:03:44,503 --> 00:03:46,574
<i>Mark was
the baby of the family.</i>

87
00:03:46,575 --> 00:03:48,611
<i>He had a hard time
in school.</i>

88
00:03:48,612 --> 00:03:50,115
<i>He was separated
from his friends</i>

89
00:03:50,116 --> 00:03:52,120
<i>and put in the class
with the special kids.</i>

90
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:54,824
<i>It didn't make him feel
very special at all.</i>

91
00:03:54,825 --> 00:03:56,461
<i>He hated school,</i>

92
00:03:56,461 --> 00:03:59,134
<i>So he spent all of his
time playing sports.</i>

93
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:01,438
<i>He'd come to the dinner
table dripping with sweat.</i>

94
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,812
<i>Mad Dog and I
nicknamed him "Smelly."</i>

95
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:07,818
<i>So I was the short kid,
Mad Dog was the fat kid</i>

96
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:09,823
<i>And Smelly had
a learning disability.</i>

97
00:04:09,824 --> 00:04:12,429
<i>Okay, I get it.
We're never gonna make it, right?</i>

98
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,600
<i>But for us, we knew
muscles were the answer</i>

99
00:04:15,602 --> 00:04:17,973
<i>and the Hulkster
showed us the way.</i>

100
00:04:17,973 --> 00:04:20,011
Train, say your prayers,
eat your vitamins.

101
00:04:20,012 --> 00:04:22,449
Be true to yourself,
true to your country.

102
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:24,920
Be a real American.

103
00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:28,127
<i>So we started
training in the basement.</i>

104
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:29,529
<i>We'd body-slam
each other,</i>

105
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:31,533
<i>drop elbows, D.D.T.S</i>

106
00:04:31,535 --> 00:04:34,406
<i>Double noggin knocker,
the abdominal stretch,</i>

107
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:37,079
<i>the iron claw,
the Boston crab</i>

108
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,281
<i>the piledriver.</i>

109
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:40,819
<i>And when Mad Dog
was too tough for me</i>

110
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:42,324
<i>I would break out
the steel chair.</i>

111
00:04:44,062 --> 00:04:46,231
<i>My mom's brother John
was a bodybuilder</i>

112
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:48,670
<i>and he gave me and my brothers
our first muscle magazines</i>

113
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,774
<i>and showed us
how to work out.</i>

114
00:04:50,776 --> 00:04:52,944
<i>And the next Christmas
instead of video games</i>

115
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:55,117
<i>we got the Hulkamania
workout set.</i>

116
00:04:55,117 --> 00:04:58,689
<i>Are you ready to feel the power?</i>

117
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:01,262
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are

118
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:04,002
the power team!

119
00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:06,173
<i>Mad Dog became the
captain of the football team</i>

120
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,547
and Smelly and I both started
competing in power lifting.

121
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:13,254
<i>Chris Bell is next at 425.</i>

122
00:05:13,254 --> 00:05:16,495
<i>Soon I was the
strongest kid in my high school.</i>

123
00:05:16,495 --> 00:05:18,499
<i>Then I broke
the New York State record.</i>

124
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,937
<i>And that's when I first got
accused of using steroids.</i>

125
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:31,893
<i>I knew guys who used
them, but they were losers.</i>

126
00:05:31,894 --> 00:05:34,932
<i>If my heroes didn't need
steroids then neither did I.</i>

127
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:36,937
<i>By the time
I was a senior</i>

128
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,108
<i>I was one of the strongest
kids in the country.</i>

129
00:05:39,108 --> 00:05:41,012
<i>Hulk Hogan was always
talking about</i>

130
00:05:41,012 --> 00:05:43,951
<i>"hanging and banging down at
Gold's Gym, Venice Beach, brother."</i>

131
00:05:43,951 --> 00:05:46,090
<i>I thought, "that's
where Arnold trains.</i>

132
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:47,894
<i>that's where
I need to be."</i>

133
00:05:47,894 --> 00:05:49,898
<i>I was gonna be
an American hero</i>

134
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:51,901
<i>And I was willing to do
whatever it takes.</i>

135
00:06:41,305 --> 00:06:43,675
<i>It's been 15 years
since I got to California</i>

136
00:06:43,677 --> 00:06:46,213
<i>and now
I'm 33 years old.</i>

137
00:06:46,215 --> 00:06:48,752
<i>When Arnold was 33
he'd already won</i>

138
00:06:48,754 --> 00:06:50,990
<i>the Mr. Olympia
seven times.</i>

139
00:06:50,992 --> 00:06:53,730
<i>Stallone had already made
"Rocky I and Rocky II."</i>

140
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,733
<i>And the Hulkster
had already been</i>

141
00:06:55,735 --> 00:06:58,540
<i>the heavyweight champion
four years in a row.</i>

142
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,612
<i>I really thought muscles
were gonna be the answer.</i>

143
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:05,353
<i>But all they got me was a
job selling gym memberships.</i>

144
00:07:05,355 --> 00:07:07,557
<i>I still train
every day at Gold's,</i>

145
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:10,999
<i>But the only thing left of Arnold
is a cheap mural on the wall</i>

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,471
<i>and a bunch of guys telling
stories about the old days,</i>

147
00:07:13,471 --> 00:07:14,973
<i>like my buddy Paul.</i>

148
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:17,211
It's changed a lot in
all these years, you know.

149
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:18,749
How long
have you been here?

150
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,218
Since 1980.

151
00:07:20,218 --> 00:07:22,456
Of course, Arnold was
on the scene and Arnold--

152
00:07:22,457 --> 00:07:25,095
Nobody had ever seen anybody
who looked like Arnold.

153
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:27,600
Sylvester Stallone had
just done the "Rocky" movies

154
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,637
and he was the type of
guy that I could relate to.

155
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,409
<i>Paul even got a chance to
work with Sly in "Over the Top."</i>

156
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,314
I should be able to
blow them away real easy.

157
00:07:38,088 --> 00:07:40,360
<i>I couldn't believe
the dream was coming true.</i>

158
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,031
<i>And did you get a chance
to do it again?</i>

159
00:07:42,031 --> 00:07:44,670
No, but I'm hoping
to get back in shape

160
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,639
to be able to make that
a reality.

161
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:48,677
You can be
on the street one day

162
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:50,848
and you can be in the
penthouse the next.

163
00:07:50,848 --> 00:07:52,117
Anything's possible.

164
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:56,927
This is
my humble abode.

165
00:07:56,928 --> 00:07:58,699
- Your humble abode right here?
- Yeah.

166
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:00,970
So do you actually
live in the van?

167
00:08:00,971 --> 00:08:02,706
I actually live--
well, I sleep in it,

168
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,142
let's put it
this way, yes.

169
00:08:04,144 --> 00:08:06,480
You sleep in it. And
then you train over here.

170
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:09,086
I train here, yeah.

171
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,656
<i>You would see
vans like this--</i>

172
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,627
<i>Guys would come from
all over the world,</i>

173
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:14,632
<i>sleep in their cars,
this and that--</i>

174
00:08:14,632 --> 00:08:16,836
<i>Anything to get a chance
to train at Gold's Gym</i>

175
00:08:16,836 --> 00:08:19,774
because we had
something special here.

176
00:08:19,776 --> 00:08:21,312
<i>What would you say
to people that say,</i>

177
00:08:21,312 --> 00:08:24,752
<i>"the dream's over, man.
You're 50 years old."</i>

178
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,490
<i>What would you say
to those people?</i>

179
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,629
They're the ones
that are short-sighted.

180
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:32,668
Now in six months I
could still be in the van,

181
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,605
but if I can
outlift everybody,

182
00:08:34,606 --> 00:08:37,613
I can outsquat them, outbench
them, out-dead-lift them,

183
00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:39,616
Who's the king?

184
00:08:39,618 --> 00:08:41,153
<i>Guys like you and me</i>

185
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,792
Can fulfill our dreams.

186
00:08:43,793 --> 00:08:45,461
We can train.

187
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:48,600
Game ain't over.
The sun is shining.

188
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,644
And it ain't over.

189
00:08:52,644 --> 00:08:54,815
<i>Is that gonna
be me in 20 years?</i>

190
00:08:54,816 --> 00:08:56,986
<i>I did everything
my heroes said--</i>

191
00:08:56,988 --> 00:08:59,124
<i>I trained,
I said my prayers,</i>

192
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,361
<i>I had my vitamins.
Where did I go wrong?</i>

193
00:09:06,874 --> 00:09:09,611
- Hey, good morning.
- Good morning.

194
00:09:09,613 --> 00:09:11,984
How are you?

195
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,756
I always make the cookie bars
'cause cookie bars are important.

196
00:09:14,758 --> 00:09:16,326
What teams did you
make these for?

197
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:18,062
I made them for Arlington
football teams

198
00:09:18,063 --> 00:09:19,966
first time ever
they won a ball game.

199
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:22,239
They used to call them
"Rosie's cookie bars"

200
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,844
and they really believe that
they help them win all the games.

201
00:09:24,845 --> 00:09:27,149
Wouldn't that be like
performance enhancement?

202
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,288
It's not an enhancement.
It's a little bit of sugar,

203
00:09:30,288 --> 00:09:32,559
which can get you going,
carbs.

204
00:09:32,561 --> 00:09:34,364
But it's all natural
ingredients.

205
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,636
There's no steroids
in here.

206
00:09:37,638 --> 00:09:41,144
Eating your mom's cooking is sort
of comforting, don't you think?

207
00:09:41,144 --> 00:09:42,548
Sure.

208
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:44,250
Things change,

209
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,256
but the cookie bars remain,
that's for sure.

210
00:09:47,258 --> 00:09:49,161
<i>My mom likes to think</i>

211
00:09:49,162 --> 00:09:51,231
<i>that the world is as pure
as her cookie bars.</i>

212
00:09:51,232 --> 00:09:53,235
<i>But life isn't always
like that.</i>

213
00:09:53,236 --> 00:09:56,008
<i>And a lot of things we grew up
believing ended up not being true.</i>

214
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:59,349
<i>First I found out there's
no such thing as Santa Claus</i>

215
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,419
<i>or the easter bunny.
That kind of sucks.</i>

216
00:10:01,421 --> 00:10:03,224
<i>Then I saw
this news report.</i>

217
00:10:03,225 --> 00:10:05,528
<i>The Iron Sheik
had been arrested recently</i>

218
00:10:05,528 --> 00:10:07,533
<i>along with wrestler
Hacksaw Jim Duggan</i>

219
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,836
<i>while driving along
the Garden State Parkway.</i>

220
00:10:09,837 --> 00:10:13,278
<i>The Iron Sheik was charged with
possession of cocaine and marijuana.</i>

221
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:15,884
<i>What has interested most
wrestling fans in this case</i>

222
00:10:15,884 --> 00:10:18,889
<i>is that the Iron Sheik and Hacksaw
are known to be adversaries.</i>

223
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,894
<i>So why were they
traveling together?</i>

224
00:10:20,894 --> 00:10:23,331
<i>Yeah, I thought
these guys hated each other.</i>

225
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:26,205
<i>Wham! Right on
the back of the Iron Sheik!</i>

226
00:10:26,206 --> 00:10:28,576
<i>Was their feud all made up?</i>

227
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:30,413
<i>Was wrestling fake?</i>

228
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:32,851
<i>Who's left
to believe in anymore?</i>

229
00:10:32,852 --> 00:10:35,090
<i>Well, at least
I still had my heroes.</i>

230
00:10:35,091 --> 00:10:37,027
<i>Those guys would never
let me down.</i>

231
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:39,599
<i># I need a hero... #</i>

232
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,971
<i>Today Hogan
admits the famous physique</i>

233
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:44,109
<i>was the result
of 12 years of steroids.</i>

234
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,250
<i>Truth is, all my heroes
had a dirty little secret.</i>

235
00:10:48,251 --> 00:10:50,721
Hollywood actor Sylvester
Stallone has been charged

236
00:10:50,722 --> 00:10:52,725
with importing
bodybuilding drugs

237
00:10:52,726 --> 00:10:54,697
when he visited Australia
last month.

238
00:10:54,698 --> 00:10:56,601
<i>Did you take steroids?
- I take them.</i>

239
00:10:56,602 --> 00:10:59,005
I took them, yeah,
up until the competition.

240
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:01,009
<i>I was always
against steroids</i>

241
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,282
<i>and when I found out that
all my heroes used them</i>

242
00:11:03,283 --> 00:11:05,953
<i>I'd like to say it didn't
bother me, but it really did.</i>

243
00:11:05,955 --> 00:11:07,924
<i>I can't imagine
how my mom would feel</i>

244
00:11:07,926 --> 00:11:09,928
<i>if she found out
that both of my brothers</i>

245
00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:12,467
<i>are on steroids
right now.</i>

246
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:15,005
<i>My older brother
started using steroids</i>

247
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:17,010
<i>when he went to play
Division I football</i>

248
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:18,746
<i>at the University
of Cincinnati.</i>

249
00:11:18,748 --> 00:11:21,119
When I got to Cincinnati the
practices were so grueling,

250
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,322
much more than
what I expected.

251
00:11:23,323 --> 00:11:25,995
<i>Coaches would say, "you gotta
get bigger, stronger, faster."</i>

252
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:27,432
<i>Was it intimidating?
- Oh, man,</i>

253
00:11:27,432 --> 00:11:29,503
A lot different than I
thought it was gonna be.

254
00:11:29,504 --> 00:11:32,509
<i>He called me from Cincinnati
and asked me for money for steroids.</i>

255
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:35,048
<i>I said, "what do you need that for?"
he says, "I can't compete here."</i>

256
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:37,986
So I'm like, "I don't know what
that is. It sounds like drugs."

257
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,793
He goes, "it is drugs." I said, "I'm
not gonna send you money for drugs.

258
00:11:40,793 --> 00:11:42,797
If you want drugs
go get a job."

259
00:11:42,798 --> 00:11:45,602
I remember at one point I
think you maybe came home

260
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,607
for a break
or you did something

261
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:50,178
and you told me, "hey,
come here, help me out."

262
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:53,385
And you pulled down your pants and you're
like, "you have to inject this in me."

263
00:11:53,386 --> 00:11:55,724
<i>And I hated it 'cause I was
totally against steroids.</i>

264
00:11:55,725 --> 00:11:58,596
And you were like, "come on,
just do it. You have to do it."

265
00:11:58,596 --> 00:12:01,436
You gotta help your big brother out,
man. So it was no decision at all.

266
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:05,177
Everybody else that was
doing well was on 'em.

267
00:12:05,177 --> 00:12:07,248
<i>Shortly after
getting on the juice</i>

268
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:09,552
<i>Mad Dog quit college to
pursue an even bigger dream.</i>

269
00:12:09,553 --> 00:12:11,623
<i>Oh, look at that now!</i>

270
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:13,159
<i>Here we go!
Mike Bell!</i>

271
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,697
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

272
00:12:14,697 --> 00:12:16,668
<i>That was my big brother
wrestling on T.V.</i>

273
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:18,738
<i>Right
hand by Bell. Oh, man!</i>

274
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:20,741
<i>Mad Dog wanted
to be a superstar,</i>

275
00:12:20,743 --> 00:12:22,745
<i>But he was what they call
a "jobber."</i>

276
00:12:22,746 --> 00:12:24,650
<i>That's the guy they pay
to get beat up</i>

277
00:12:24,652 --> 00:12:27,022
<i>to make the other guys look
good. He didn't care, though.</i>

278
00:12:27,023 --> 00:12:29,995
<i>He was gonna get himself a contract
and headline "Wrestlemania."</i>

279
00:12:29,995 --> 00:12:31,831
<i>Why did you
even come in the ring?</i>

280
00:12:31,832 --> 00:12:33,235
<i>You should have
gone home, dummy.</i>

281
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:35,105
<i>But he never
got the contract</i>

282
00:12:35,106 --> 00:12:38,078
<i>And eventually
the W.W.E. stopped calling.</i>

283
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,082
<i>Why did you think
you didn't make it?</i>

284
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:42,754
<i>Probably mostly
my own fault.</i>

285
00:12:42,755 --> 00:12:44,926
I went from being a guy
who used steroids

286
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,763
to a guy who used
steroids and pot.

287
00:12:46,764 --> 00:12:48,768
<i>And I still needed
to escape reality</i>

288
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,472
so I started taking ecstasy,
cocaine, acid, painkillers.

289
00:12:51,474 --> 00:12:53,778
<i>Mike Bell is where
he does not need to be now.</i>

290
00:12:53,778 --> 00:12:55,782
<i>He's in the wrong corner
and he's paying the price.</i>

291
00:12:55,783 --> 00:12:57,786
<i>Mad Dog always told me</i>

292
00:12:57,787 --> 00:12:59,822
<i>that he'd rather be dead
than average.</i>

293
00:12:59,823 --> 00:13:01,727
<i>And when he thought
his dream was over</i>

294
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:04,265
<i>he couldn't cope
with the failure.</i>

295
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:06,037
<i>So I had a
bottle of liquid lead,</i>

296
00:13:06,038 --> 00:13:08,408
a bottle of NyQuil and four
boxes of sleeping pills.

297
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:10,111
I went down
to the river

298
00:13:10,113 --> 00:13:12,616
<i>down by
the railroad tracks,</i>

299
00:13:12,618 --> 00:13:16,224
<i>parked my car,
took everything.</i>

300
00:13:16,225 --> 00:13:18,897
And he tried
to walk into the--

301
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:24,542
He tried to walk
into the Hudson river.

302
00:13:24,543 --> 00:13:26,645
<i>So did you take
all the sleeping pills?</i>

303
00:13:26,647 --> 00:13:28,416
<i>- Everything.
- And the lead additive?</i>

304
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:30,621
There's no way I should be
alive right now. There's no way.

305
00:13:30,623 --> 00:13:32,325
<i>It's 10 years later</i>

306
00:13:32,326 --> 00:13:34,162
<i>and despite everything
that happened</i>

307
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:36,299
<i>Mad Dog is still trying
to get that contract,</i>

308
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:38,303
<i>Trying to keep
the dream alive.</i>

309
00:13:38,304 --> 00:13:40,307
'Cause I've been
all over the world

310
00:13:40,308 --> 00:13:43,581
from Singapore to Louisville,
and it doesn't matter--

311
00:13:43,582 --> 00:13:46,086
You line 'em up,
I'll knock 'em down.

312
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:47,789
I can see why
you never made it.

313
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,332
<i>Mad Dog used to wrestle
in front of a television audience</i>

314
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:54,336
<i>of 10 million people
every week,</i>

315
00:13:54,337 --> 00:13:58,379
<i>but tonight he's wrestling
at the Portuguese Men's Center</i>

316
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:02,321
<i>In front of 200 people
for about 50 bucks.</i>

317
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:08,533
<i>And instead of
wrestling Bret the Hitman Hart</i>

318
00:14:08,534 --> 00:14:10,303
<i>He's facing Midgeto</i>

319
00:14:10,304 --> 00:14:12,307
<i>And he's getting
his ass kicked.</i>

320
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:15,514
Come on, man,
come on.

321
00:14:18,587 --> 00:14:21,225
<i>My baby brother Smelly
was always trying to keep up</i>

322
00:14:21,226 --> 00:14:23,630
<i>and despite everything
that happened to Mad Dog</i>

323
00:14:23,631 --> 00:14:25,634
<i>he followed in his
footsteps anyway,</i>

324
00:14:25,635 --> 00:14:28,607
<i>becoming a pro wrestler
and using steroids.</i>

325
00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:31,179
The reason I decided
to use steroids was simple.

326
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:32,683
I just needed
to get bigger.

327
00:14:32,684 --> 00:14:34,186
That was
pretty much it.

328
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:36,524
<i>But unlike when Mad
Dog started using steroids,</i>

329
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:38,195
<i>Smelly had a wife
to consider.</i>

330
00:14:38,196 --> 00:14:39,831
<i>When you got married
did you ever think</i>

331
00:14:39,831 --> 00:14:42,070
<i>that your husband would be
injecting himself with something?</i>

332
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:45,043
No, that didn't even enter
in my conscious thought.

333
00:14:45,043 --> 00:14:47,581
<i>When I first met him
he was against steroids.</i>

334
00:14:47,581 --> 00:14:48,950
<i>He was like,
"you don't need to do it.</i>

335
00:14:48,951 --> 00:14:51,155
I've never done 'em. I
just don't believe in 'em."

336
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,092
<i>I was pretty upset about it</i>

337
00:14:53,094 --> 00:14:55,364
<i>Because I didn't want it to come
to that. I was kind of scared.</i>

338
00:14:55,365 --> 00:14:59,304
I didn't want to inject
this oil into my body.

339
00:14:59,306 --> 00:15:01,342
I thought
it was weird.

340
00:15:01,344 --> 00:15:03,346
He's not a huge guy,
you know.

341
00:15:03,347 --> 00:15:04,984
He's 6' if he's lucky

342
00:15:04,985 --> 00:15:08,356
<i>and so I knew that it was
definitely going to help</i>

343
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:11,498
because that's
what it does,

344
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:14,001
what steroids do--
make you bigger.

345
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:17,243
She basically said,
"do what you need to do."

346
00:15:17,244 --> 00:15:19,246
<i>Here's Jake with the daddy.</i>

347
00:15:19,248 --> 00:15:21,150
<i>After their son
was born Smelly decided</i>

348
00:15:21,152 --> 00:15:24,759
<i>The life of a pro wrestler was
not exactly what he wanted anymore.</i>

349
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,796
Here's my little Jake
in his swing.

350
00:15:26,797 --> 00:15:29,934
<i>Mark: Looking back, I don't
really know what the hell I wanted.</i>

351
00:15:29,936 --> 00:15:32,673
Having a contract means
that you belong to W.W.E.

352
00:15:32,674 --> 00:15:34,879
And you have to travel.
I was married with a kid.

353
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,585
<i>I mean, that's really
all I need--</i>

354
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:39,755
A house, a kid and a wife. I'm set.

355
00:15:39,756 --> 00:15:41,427
One, two, three!

356
00:15:41,427 --> 00:15:42,996
<i>They settled
down in the suburbs</i>

357
00:15:42,998 --> 00:15:45,000
<i>and Smelly even
opened up his own gym.</i>

358
00:15:45,001 --> 00:15:46,738
<i>Yeah, my little brother
gave up</i>

359
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:48,875
<i>the wrestling dream for
a respectable family life,</i>

360
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,046
<i>but he didn't quite
give up everything.</i>

361
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:57,025
<i>Now that I'm into it</i>

362
00:15:57,027 --> 00:16:00,065
<i>I realize it's not really
all that bad. I love steroids.</i>

363
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:02,770
I think I'll probably be
on and off of them

364
00:16:02,772 --> 00:16:04,475
probably forever.

365
00:16:04,475 --> 00:16:06,445
This is what you trained
for! This is what you do!

366
00:16:06,446 --> 00:16:09,017
<i>Come on, boy!</i>

367
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:11,087
<i>I thought that
we had an agreement</i>

368
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:12,557
that he did it
for wrestling.

369
00:16:12,557 --> 00:16:14,160
Now he's not
wrestling anymore

370
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:16,466
so naturally I thought
he would just stop.

371
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:18,769
<i>In my mind there's no excuse</i>

372
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,109
<i>for not being as strong
as you possibly can be.</i>

373
00:16:22,312 --> 00:16:24,615
<i>You do what you gotta do
to win.</i>

374
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,023
<i>Come on, Chris,
let's do this now.</i>

375
00:16:30,328 --> 00:16:33,433
<i>Let's give it up
for him. It's a lot of weight.</i>

376
00:16:33,434 --> 00:16:35,205
There it is.

377
00:16:35,206 --> 00:16:36,440
Come on now!

378
00:16:40,951 --> 00:16:44,290
<i>Smoke
show! Come on, Chris.</i>

379
00:16:47,197 --> 00:16:49,167
- Take it, take it.
Take it, take it.

380
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:53,241
<i>Nice
try, Chris, nice try.</i>

381
00:16:53,243 --> 00:16:55,413
<i>If you are apprehensive</i>

382
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,650
about taking a steroid
or you're apprehensive

383
00:16:57,652 --> 00:16:59,855
about trying
some new methods

384
00:16:59,856 --> 00:17:02,027
then maybe you're not
cut out to be a champion.

385
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:04,866
<i>In first
place, Mark Bell.</i>

386
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:07,838
<i>I guess I'm not
cut out to be a champion,</i>

387
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,180
<i>because I tried steroids but
I felt so guilty I had to stop.</i>

388
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:13,483
- Are you gonna win worst overall lifter?
- Yeah.

389
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:15,121
<i>And now I can't even compete</i>

390
00:17:15,122 --> 00:17:17,025
<i>In the sport
I grew up loving.</i>

391
00:17:17,026 --> 00:17:20,566
<i>I mean, my baby brother
just beat me by 130 lbs.</i>

392
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:25,108
<i>We all grew up
in the same house,</i>

393
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:28,715
<i>so why are my brothers fine
with steroids but I'm not?</i>

394
00:17:28,717 --> 00:17:30,486
What would you say
the differences are

395
00:17:30,487 --> 00:17:33,025
- between the three kids.
- Between the three?

396
00:17:33,026 --> 00:17:35,329
Well, I always kind of
say it like this--

397
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,800
you were in the middle
of two guys

398
00:17:37,801 --> 00:17:39,704
that were very
strapping, athletic,

399
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:41,710
and you were tiny
and short in stature,

400
00:17:41,711 --> 00:17:44,950
so I worked extra hard to
make you feel extra special.

401
00:17:44,951 --> 00:17:46,819
<i>One day I took you
in your room--</i>

402
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,558
I don't know if you remember
this conversation where I said,

403
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:52,131
"Christopher, what's the
best part of an Oreo cookie?"

404
00:17:52,132 --> 00:17:54,068
What is the best part
of an Oreo cookie?

405
00:17:54,069 --> 00:17:56,373
<i>- The middle.
- The middle. That's right.</i>

406
00:17:56,374 --> 00:18:00,249
So even though you have two
sides of a cookie on this end,

407
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,018
the middle part is
the most delicious.

408
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:04,390
Everybody wants the middle.
They even made double stuff.

409
00:18:04,391 --> 00:18:07,128
<i>Yep, this is pretty
much how it was growing up.</i>

410
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,833
<i>Mom stayed at home
with the kids</i>

411
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:11,505
<i>while Dad wore a suit
and tie and went to work.</i>

412
00:18:11,506 --> 00:18:14,944
<i>He was at I.B.M. for 20
years until he was downsized.</i>

413
00:18:14,945 --> 00:18:17,450
<i>But now he has his own
business doing taxes.</i>

414
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:19,721
<i>Everybody thinks
that success in America</i>

415
00:18:19,722 --> 00:18:22,227
<i>is in the amount of dollars that
you have. And that's not true.</i>

416
00:18:22,228 --> 00:18:24,064
The real true heroes
are people

417
00:18:24,065 --> 00:18:26,067
who go to work every day
and do their job

418
00:18:26,068 --> 00:18:28,673
and bring up their kids to
the best of their ability.

419
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,678
<i>I wanted to be Hulk Hogan.</i>

420
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:33,349
<i>I wanted to be Arnold. I
wanted to be Sylvester Stallone.</i>

421
00:18:33,351 --> 00:18:35,855
<i>Did you have heroes like that
growing up, when you were a kid?</i>

422
00:18:35,855 --> 00:18:38,795
<i>Yeah, we
did. We had heroes</i>

423
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:42,269
<i>like Mickey Mantle,
Roger Maris.</i>

424
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:44,605
<i>But I knew I could
never aspire to it</i>

425
00:18:44,606 --> 00:18:46,877
<i>because back then
you grew up,</i>

426
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:49,215
<i>you graduated, you got
married and you had kids.</i>

427
00:18:49,217 --> 00:18:51,954
<i>Yeah, my dad
had the American dream--</i>

428
00:18:51,955 --> 00:18:54,126
<i>you know, marry your
high-school sweetheart,</i>

429
00:18:54,127 --> 00:18:57,701
<i>buy a house and take your
kids to see the Yankees.</i>

430
00:18:57,701 --> 00:18:59,704
<i>But things are
different now.</i>

431
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:03,112
<i>And even baseball's changed
from when my dad was growing up.</i>

432
00:19:03,113 --> 00:19:05,116
<i>And now when I think
of baseball</i>

433
00:19:05,117 --> 00:19:07,488
<i>I don't think about the
Babe or Hammerin' Hank.</i>

434
00:19:10,428 --> 00:19:12,463
<i>I think of steroids.</i>

435
00:19:12,464 --> 00:19:17,241
<i>This one is a
monster! It is out of here!</i>

436
00:19:17,242 --> 00:19:21,482
<i>After the strike of
'94 baseball was almost dead.</i>

437
00:19:21,483 --> 00:19:23,586
<i>But then Mark McGuire
and Sammy Sosa</i>

438
00:19:23,587 --> 00:19:25,692
<i>started smashing
home runs,</i>

439
00:19:25,693 --> 00:19:27,930
<i>racing toward the
single-season record.</i>

440
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:30,034
<i>You see,
about 1000 years ago</i>

441
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:32,740
<i>Babe Ruth had 60 home
runs in one season.</i>

442
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,576
<i>And then when my
parents were still kids</i>

443
00:19:34,577 --> 00:19:36,882
<i>Roger Maris hit
number 61.</i>

444
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:39,520
<i>He was the home-run champ
for 37 years</i>

445
00:19:39,521 --> 00:19:42,794
<i>until Big Mac came along
and crushed that record</i>

446
00:19:42,795 --> 00:19:46,201
<i>with 70 home runs
and baseball was saved.</i>

447
00:19:46,202 --> 00:19:47,939
<i>Gone!</i>

448
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,680
<i>Mark McGuire, you have just
broken the home-run record.</i>

449
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:53,517
<i>What are you going
to do next?</i>

450
00:19:53,518 --> 00:19:54,986
We're going
to Disney World.

451
00:19:57,092 --> 00:20:00,030
<i>I guess Barry Bonds
wanted to go to Disney world too</i>

452
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:01,532
<i>'cause in 2001</i>

453
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,938
<i>he smashed 73 bombs
to break McGuire's record.</i>

454
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:05,575
<i>This is the one!</i>

455
00:20:05,576 --> 00:20:07,578
<i>There's a new
record homer!</i>

456
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:10,352
<i>See, baseball
players used to be scrawny,</i>

457
00:20:10,353 --> 00:20:13,223
<i>but now these guys were
jacked and it was cool.</i>

458
00:20:13,224 --> 00:20:15,630
<i>They started looking
like pro wrestlers.</i>

459
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,935
If you were to
construct a home-run hitter

460
00:20:18,936 --> 00:20:22,343
in a lab, put him together,
he'd look like that.

461
00:20:22,344 --> 00:20:24,647
<i>Turns out, that was
kind of what was going on.</i>

462
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:27,220
The man with ties
to some big-name athletes

463
00:20:27,221 --> 00:20:28,923
has been charged
with providing

464
00:20:28,924 --> 00:20:30,993
performance-enhancing
drugs to the pros.

465
00:20:30,994 --> 00:20:33,933
<i>The guy with the pencil-thin
mustache is Victor Conte.</i>

466
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:36,538
<i>He used to be the bass
player for Tower of Power,</i>

467
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,542
<i>but when that career
didn't work out</i>

468
00:20:38,544 --> 00:20:40,749
<i>he did what any failed
musician would do--</i>

469
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,453
<i>he started selling undetectable
steroids to athletes.</i>

470
00:20:43,454 --> 00:20:45,491
Will you name names?

471
00:20:45,492 --> 00:20:47,328
There will be
naming of names.

472
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,367
<i>Conte's files
named over 250 athletes,</i>

473
00:20:50,368 --> 00:20:54,009
<i>including the home-run
king himself, Barry Bonds.</i>

474
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:56,113
<i>And then something
even crazier happened--</i>

475
00:20:56,114 --> 00:20:58,251
<i>Jose Canseco
wrote a book.</i>

476
00:20:58,252 --> 00:21:01,590
<i>The surprise wasn't that he was
literate, it's what he wrote about.</i>

477
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:03,930
<i>He said he'd been taking
steroids since '86,</i>

478
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:06,367
<i>that 80% of baseball
was on the juice</i>

479
00:21:06,368 --> 00:21:09,007
<i>and that he personally
injected his former bash brother</i>

480
00:21:09,008 --> 00:21:10,911
<i>Mark McGuire
in the ass.</i>

481
00:21:10,912 --> 00:21:12,114
But why, Mr. McGuire?

482
00:21:12,115 --> 00:21:14,451
Do you want to know
the terrifying truth

483
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:16,722
or do you want to see me
sock a few dingers?

484
00:21:16,723 --> 00:21:18,661
Dingers!
Dingers!

485
00:21:19,462 --> 00:21:21,097
Ooh.

486
00:21:21,098 --> 00:21:23,304
All right,
Congress wants to haul

487
00:21:23,305 --> 00:21:24,839
a bunch of baseball players

488
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,710
up to Capitol Hill
to talk about steroids.

489
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:30,952
<i>In 2005 Congress
spent 151 days in session.</i>

490
00:21:30,953 --> 00:21:33,791
<i>They spent eight of those days
debating steroids in sports.</i>

491
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,830
<i>That's more time than they
spent on national healthcare,</i>

492
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:38,835
<i>why the levees broke
in New Orleans,</i>

493
00:21:38,836 --> 00:21:40,839
<i>and more than ending
the war in Iraq.</i>

494
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,244
<i>Apparently,
the United States Congress</i>

495

<i>takes this whole national
pastime thing kind of seriously.</i>

496
00:21:46,285 --> 00:21:49,290
I'm a baseball fan.
I always have been.

497
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,962
Let me just start by saying
that I am a huge baseball fan.

498
00:21:51,963 --> 00:21:54,300
For me baseball is not a game,
it's a passion.

499
00:21:54,301 --> 00:21:56,471
We have every right
to be concerned

500
00:21:56,472 --> 00:21:59,578
that the national pastime
and all that it represents

501
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:05,089
<i>has been threatened by the
selfish actions of a few.</i>

502
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,497
There's something simply
un-American about this.

503
00:22:08,498 --> 00:22:12,003
<i>If using steroids makes
the Bash brothers un-American,</i>

504
00:22:12,005 --> 00:22:15,144
<i>what does that make
the Bell brothers?</i>

505
00:22:15,145 --> 00:22:18,518
Congressman Kanjorski, do you
think that this is not a matter

506
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:20,387
for the U.S. Congress
to be deliberating?

507
00:22:20,388 --> 00:22:22,058
<i>I just don't think
it's necessary.</i>

508
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:23,996
<i>Why are we just gonna
call seven people</i>

509
00:22:23,997 --> 00:22:25,398
<i>and of what importance
are they?</i>

510
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,672
In the last 52 years
we've only done it 25 times.

511
00:22:28,673 --> 00:22:30,675
14 of those times were

512
00:22:30,676 --> 00:22:32,279
by the un-American
activities committee.

513
00:22:34,384 --> 00:22:37,289
Are you now or have ever been
a member of the Communist Party?

514
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:40,128
Well, sir, I'm not here
to talk about the past.

515
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,702
I have never
used steroids, period.

516
00:22:43,703 --> 00:22:46,710
Did you know that other
players were using steroids?

517
00:22:46,711 --> 00:22:50,417
I have never seen a syringe.
I have never seen steroids.

518
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:52,923
But in locker-room gossip--
you may not have seen it.

519
00:22:52,923 --> 00:22:55,494
People talk, right? "this guy's doing
something, that guy's doing something."

520
00:22:55,496 --> 00:22:58,868
Now Mr. McGuire, would you
like to comment on that?

521
00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:01,307
<i>You don't want
to comment?</i>

522
00:23:01,307 --> 00:23:02,710
Are you taking the fifth?

523
00:23:04,515 --> 00:23:07,385
This is about values.
It's about our culture.

524
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,857
It's about who we
define ourselves to be.

525
00:23:09,858 --> 00:23:12,730
When we want to define
to a foreign country

526
00:23:12,731 --> 00:23:16,203
what we're about and
you're gonna show a film,

527
00:23:16,204 --> 00:23:18,576
what would you
go show?

528
00:23:18,576 --> 00:23:20,579
<i>Hey, how about "Rocky IV"?</i>

529
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,351
<i>There's nothing
more American than that.</i>

530
00:23:22,352 --> 00:23:25,123
<i>The big Russian trains
in a high-tech facility</i>

531
00:23:25,124 --> 00:23:27,795
<i>with a whole team

532
00:23:27,796 --> 00:23:30,768
<i>and of course
he takes steroids.</i>

533
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:32,572
<i>Meanwhile, Rocky's
out there lifting logs,</i>

534
00:23:32,573 --> 00:23:36,480
<i>chopping wood, training in
a barn the all-natural way,</i>

535
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,219
<i>'cause only Commies would
take steroids, right?</i>

536
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,923
<i>Sure, Sly,
whatever you say.</i>

537
00:23:41,924 --> 00:23:44,329
Truth is, steroids were
the secret weapon

538
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:46,134
that helped American
fight the Russians

539
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:47,836
on the Olympic
battlefield.

540
00:23:47,837 --> 00:23:49,840
And it all
began here,

541
00:23:49,842 --> 00:23:52,179
York BarHenry
in Pennsylvania.

542
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,182
<i>When you
were an Olympic coach</i>

543
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,788
<i>did you see a lot of
steroid use going on?</i>

544
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:59,294
Much.

545
00:23:59,295 --> 00:24:00,730
- Yeah.
- Much.

546
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,037
<i>Smitty's 83,
one of the old-timers.</i>

547
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:07,478
<i>He was the coach of the Olympic
weight-lifting team back then.</i>

548
00:24:07,385 --> 00:24:09,356
Was it ever thought of
as cheating at that point?

549
00:24:09,357 --> 00:24:13,465
No. No, because we figured
everybody was taking it.

550
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,855
We figured
even steven.

551
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:18,393
<i>Smitty told me the story
about how anabolic steroids</i>

552
00:24:18,394 --> 00:24:20,297
<i>were first introduced
to the U.S. Olympic team.</i>

553
00:24:20,298 --> 00:24:22,400
<i>It was the late 1950s</i>

554
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:25,105
<i>and the Russians were
dominating America</i>

555
00:24:25,106 --> 00:24:26,708
<i>in the space race
and at the Olympics.</i>

556
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:30,147
<i>But one night the
Russian coach got drunk</i>

557
00:24:30,148 --> 00:24:32,118
<i>and told
the American coach</i>

558
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:34,623
<i>they'd been injecting their
athletes with steroids.</i>

559
00:24:34,624 --> 00:24:36,292
<i>The American coach
raced home</i>

560
00:24:36,294 --> 00:24:38,396
<i>and developed an even more
powerful steroid</i>

561
00:24:38,397 --> 00:24:41,634
<i>specifically
for team U.S.A.</i>

562
00:24:41,635 --> 00:24:45,576
<i>So if steroids actually helped
America beat the commies,</i>

563
00:24:45,576 --> 00:24:48,414
<i>How did it get
such a bad rap?</i>

564
00:24:48,415 --> 00:24:51,487
<i>Last week former
N.F.L. Defensive lineman Lyle Alzado</i>

565
00:24:51,488 --> 00:24:54,558
<i>told N.B.C. News that
steroids were the cause</i>

<i>of his inoperable

567
00:24:56,864 --> 00:24:58,500
How long were you
on steroids?

568
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,502
Most of my
pro career.

569
00:25:00,503 --> 00:25:02,907
You know,
I played 16 years.

570
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:05,680
And it got me where I wanted
but also got me very sick.

571
00:25:05,681 --> 00:25:07,415

<i>but for something
just as dangerous.</i>

579
00:25:23,012 --> 00:25:25,016
Health damage from steroids
can include

00:25:25,017 --> 00:25:27,619
heart, joint
and reproductive problems,

581
00:25:27,621 --> 00:25:29,056
this is a drug
that kills.

582
00:25:29,057 --> 00:25:31,594
What happens is that
these retarded idiots

583
00:25:31,595 --> 00:25:33,597
that give us the news,
these talking heads

584
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:36,568
that babble on T.V.
give us this rhetoric

585
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:38,573
that comes from
not one single expert.

586
00:25:38,574 --> 00:25:42,113
And they say ridiculous things
like steroids will kill you,

587
00:25:42,114 --> 00:25:44,183
they'll rot your kidneys,
they'll give you cancer,

588
00:25:44,184 --> 00:25:46,354
they'll do all these horrible
things that are just not true.

591

Lyle Alzado didn't die

I trained with him
for two years.

596
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,986
He didn't die from steroids.
He died from a brain tumor.

since the late 1930s.

605
00:26:23,455 --> 00:26:25,759
I hope we haven't been
purposely killing people.

606
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,397
Can they be used safely?
Yeah.

607

<i>And for people with

<i>Jeff has been fighting

<i>and he says

614
00:26:49,671 --> 00:26:53,076
Back in '92 I was
down to two "T" cells

615
00:26:53,077 --> 00:26:56,182
and very sick. I'd
developed P.C.P. pneumonia.

616
00:26:56,183 --> 00:26:58,519
Both my lungs collapsed.
I almost didn't make it.

617
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,092
I came out of a hospital
weighing 125 lbs.

618
00:27:01,093 --> 00:27:04,431
<i>So I started researching and
found a clinical trial in L.A.</i>

619
00:27:04,432 --> 00:27:07,001
<i>They were studying Anavar,
an old bodybuilding drug,</i>

620

<i>to test how it worked
for people with H.I.V.</i>

621
00:27:09,607 --> 00:27:11,911
So I signed myself up,
got a fairly high dose

622
00:27:11,912 --> 00:27:13,913
and responded amazingly.

623
00:27:13,914 --> 00:27:17,821
I gained 30 lbs
in six weeks

624
00:27:17,823 --> 00:27:19,724
and I gained
300 "T" cells.

625
00:27:19,726 --> 00:27:21,796
<i>So these drugs

<i>if you're a healthy athlete

628
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:28,776
How can you say steroids are
a national public health crisis

629
00:27:28,777 --> 00:27:32,148
when you have people dropping dead at
a rate you can measure by the minute

630
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,050
as a result
of alcohol and tobacco?

631
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:36,355
<i>According to the C.D.C.,</i>

632
00:27:36,356 --> 00:27:39,929
<i>tobacco kills about 435,000
Americans every year,</i>

633
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:43,602
<i>alcohol kills
about 75,000,</i>

634
00:27:43,603 --> 00:27:46,741
<i>and deaths from anabolic
steroid abuse-- three.</i>

635
00:27:46,742 --> 00:27:50,015
<i>But steroids also show up

00:27:50,016 --> 00:27:52,018
<i>emergency room visits.</i>

637
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:54,087
<i>But it's not exactly
number one on the list--</i>

638
00:27:54,088 --> 00:27:56,526
<i>that would be alcohol;
or number two--</i>

639
00:27:56,527 --> 00:27:58,529
<i>that's cocaine;</i>

640
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,901
<i>or number three--
that's marijuana.</i>

641
00:28:00,902 --> 00:28:03,239
<i>Gotta be top 10,
though, right?</i>

642
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,241
<i>Uh, not quite.</i>

in your tracks" and so on.</i>

660
00:28:51,627 --> 00:28:54,199
And the athletes are looking
around saying, "Jesus,

661
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,236
haven't seen
that many guys die."

662
00:28:56,237 --> 00:28:58,239
<i>Are steroids
killing people?</i>

663
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,242
Steroids clearly are
killing people

664
00:29:00,243 --> 00:29:02,247
both in the short term
and in the long term.

665
00:29:02,248 --> 00:29:05,586
<i>Dr. Gary Wadler is an advisor
to the world anti-doping agency</i>

666
00:29:05,586 --> 00:29:08,490
<i>and the media's go-to guy
when it comes to steroids.</i>

667
00:29:08,491 --> 00:29:10,496
We know it's been associated

668
00:29:10,497 --> 00:29:12,499
with stroke
in young people

669
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,837
for which there was no
other obvious explanation.

670
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:18,844
We know it's been
associated with heart attacks

671
00:29:18,845 --> 00:29:21,883
for which there was no
other obvious explanation.

672
00:29:21,884 --> 00:29:23,551
We know
it increases clotting.

673
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:26,458
What bothers me are people
like Dr. Gary Wadler

674
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:29,028
who's a physician
and going before Congress

675
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:31,267
and saying these things,
and when confronted--

676
00:29:31,268 --> 00:29:33,270
"Please produce
a single article

677
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,476
that shows any of this in any
scientific way," can't do it.

678
00:29:36,477 --> 00:29:39,347
<i>Dr. Norm Fost is a
professor of medical ethics</i>

679
00:29:39,348 --> 00:29:42,153
<i>with a research focus on
performance-enhancing drugs.</i>

680
00:29:42,153 --> 00:29:44,624
So I'm not denying
that there aren't

681
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:47,195
some serious adverse effects
from anabolic steroids.

682
00:29:47,197 --> 00:29:49,866
<i>It's just that we haven't been
able to demonstrate any of them.</i>

683
00:29:49,867 --> 00:29:51,537
<i>Maybe that's because
we don't study them.</i>

684
00:29:51,538 --> 00:29:54,142
One of the problems
with the ban on steroids

685
00:29:54,143 --> 00:29:56,479
is that it's impossible
to do the kind of research

686
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,914
that would answer
these questions.

687
00:29:57,915 --> 00:30:00,619
Some purists would like
to see those studies done.

688
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:02,790
Well, I can assure you
they never will be done.

689
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:05,730
It would be a totally
unethical study to do.

690
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:08,468
So we have to use the
information we have at hand.

691
00:30:08,469 --> 00:30:10,838
Depression, convulsions,

692
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:13,743
anxiety, jaundice,

693
00:30:13,744 --> 00:30:16,383
myocardial infarction--
which is heart attack--

694
00:30:16,384 --> 00:30:18,385
eczema, abscess,

695
00:30:18,386 --> 00:30:20,589
vaginal pain,
vaginal discharge.

696
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:24,163
You wanna know what I'm reading
this from? What does that say?

697
00:30:24,163 --> 00:30:25,598
- "Vitamin c."
- Thank you.

698
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:28,505
I mean, look, peanuts are
dangerous. You understand?

699
00:30:28,506 --> 00:30:31,376
There are people
that take a peanut

700
00:30:31,377 --> 00:30:35,083
and have a peanut and they
go into anaphylactic shock.

701
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:37,922
<i>Okay? The airway closes
up. That's it. They die.</i>

702
00:30:37,923 --> 00:30:40,559
Now does that mean
that we ban peanuts

703
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,097
and sue God
for making them?

704
00:30:43,098 --> 00:30:45,000
<i>- No.
- Right.</i>

705
00:30:45,001 --> 00:30:48,074
What we do is we say,
"okay, peanut warnings."

706
00:30:48,075 --> 00:30:50,077
There is no safe drug.

707
00:30:50,078 --> 00:30:52,648
There is no safe drug
that ever exists.

708
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,287
There's always
the benefit-to-risk ratio.

709
00:30:55,288 --> 00:30:57,290
You name the drug--
"X" percent of people

710
00:30:57,291 --> 00:30:59,294
<i>will suffer
adverse effects.</i>

711
00:30:59,295 --> 00:31:01,432
<i>Do you feel
any side effects ever?</i>

712
00:31:01,432 --> 00:31:03,669
<i>Yeah, I've had
some side effects--</i>

713
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:06,207
acne, hair growth.

714
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:08,411
Some side effects
that I've had are--

715
00:31:08,412 --> 00:31:10,548
<i>What do you mean by hair
growth? On your head?</i>

716
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:12,618
No, just on my chest
and my back and stuff.

717
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:14,489
I never break out.
My back doesn't break out.

718
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,492
I don't get hairy
from it.

719
00:31:16,493 --> 00:31:18,462
You get a little
testicular atrophy,

720
00:31:18,463 --> 00:31:20,432
but then they come back.
It's normal.

721
00:31:20,433 --> 00:31:22,269
<i>- Your balls shrank?
- The balls shank.</i>

722
00:31:22,269 --> 00:31:23,905
<i>- Who needs 'em?
- Who needs 'em?</i>

723
00:31:23,906 --> 00:31:26,044
What about testosterone?
I have some friends who say

724
00:31:26,045 --> 00:31:28,714
it is like a wonder drug.
It makes them feel great.

725
00:31:28,715 --> 00:31:31,553
It makes them feel,
you know, frisky

726
00:31:31,554 --> 00:31:34,291
<i>and young and it's
great for their skin.</i>

727
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:36,763
The negative side effects would
be my lovely singing voice,

728
00:31:36,765 --> 00:31:38,932
<i>hair like a monkey
from my head to my toes,</i>

729
00:31:38,933 --> 00:31:42,140
I mean, hair growing out places
you don't even want to talk about.

730
00:31:42,141 --> 00:31:44,210
I mean,
I want to stay feminine.

731
00:31:44,211 --> 00:31:46,212
And I think that's why
I get so much work.

732
00:31:46,213 --> 00:31:48,217
It's because I still
look like a woman

733
00:31:48,218 --> 00:31:50,087
and I still have
hard muscles.

734
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:51,856
<i>In my experience,</i>

735
00:31:51,857 --> 00:31:54,295
<i>steroids are just gonna make
you more of whatever you are.</i>

736
00:31:54,296 --> 00:31:57,434
If you're a jerk
and you take steroids

737
00:31:57,435 --> 00:32:00,539
<i>- You're a super jerk, right?
- An asshole.</i>

738
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,810
You've seen that, right? You
go beyond. You're an asshole.

739
00:32:02,811 --> 00:32:04,548
<i>I've never seen Roid Rage.</i>

740
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:07,385
I've never seen any
difference in his personality

741
00:32:07,386 --> 00:32:10,057
or how he is with me,
how he is with Jake.

742
00:32:10,057 --> 00:32:12,060
<i>It hasn't done
anything</i>

743
00:32:12,061 --> 00:32:15,099
that all those after-school
specials tell you that it's gonna do.

744
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:16,936
Bryce, I gotta
get bigger, man.

745
00:32:16,938 --> 00:32:19,607
- Here, this might help.
- Steroids?

746
00:32:19,608 --> 00:32:21,811
<i>What is going on with you?</i>

747
00:32:21,813 --> 00:32:23,481
God damn it!

748
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:36,072
<i>While I was visiting
my brother and his family</i>

749
00:32:36,073 --> 00:32:38,742
<i>they told me they were
thinking of having another child</i>

750
00:32:38,743 --> 00:32:42,416
<i>but that another possible side
effect of steroids was on their minds.</i>

751
00:32:42,417 --> 00:32:43,786
<i>If you couldn't have
another kid</i>

752
00:32:43,787 --> 00:32:45,588
<i>would it be something
that you'd regret</i>

753
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,092
<i>because you did
steroids?</i>

754
00:32:47,093 --> 00:32:50,030
Yeah. If it was
simply from that, yeah.

755
00:32:50,031 --> 00:32:52,669
I'd probably regret it.
But there's a lot of things

756
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,173
people regret in their
lives, so I'm not, you know--

757
00:32:55,174 --> 00:32:58,613
it's a decision I made and it's
a decision I'll have to live with,

758
00:32:58,614 --> 00:33:00,583
whatever
the consequences are.

759
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:09,366
<i>It's been 15
years since Alzado died.</i>

760
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:11,871
- Why did you lie to me?
- I was afraid...

761
00:33:11,872 --> 00:33:14,174
<i>Looking back at
Maria Shriver's interview</i>

762
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:16,178
<i>I can't help
but wonder,</i>

763
00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:18,682
<i>why wasn't she asking
the real questions like</i>

764
00:33:18,683 --> 00:33:21,188
<i>"is this gonna happen
to my husband?"</i>

765
00:33:21,189 --> 00:33:23,224
<i>Did she really
believe Lyle</i>

766
00:33:23,226 --> 00:33:25,229
<i>or was this
just the beginning</i>

767
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:28,267
<i>of the steroid myth?</i>

768
00:33:28,268 --> 00:33:31,105
<i>And even though the experts
know a lot more about steroids,</i>

769
00:33:31,106 --> 00:33:33,309
<i>you sure wouldn't know it
from watching the news.</i>

770
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,815
Tonight, one of the nation's
most serious drug problems

771
00:33:35,816 --> 00:33:38,853
and it's only getting worse.
It's steroids.

772
00:33:38,854 --> 00:33:40,856
Professional wrestler
Chris Benoit

773
00:33:40,857 --> 00:33:43,261
killed his wife,
his seven-year-old son,

774
00:33:43,262 --> 00:33:44,697
and then hung himself.

775
00:33:44,698 --> 00:33:47,569
<i>Why did he do it?
Steroids found in the house.</i>

776
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,873
Steroids cause
suicidal tendencies.

777
00:33:49,874 --> 00:33:51,576
<i>They hallucinate.
They hear voices.</i>

778
00:33:51,577 --> 00:33:53,447
<i>Depression, paranoia.</i>

779
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,451
Steroids could be
the actual cause...

780
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:56,786
Speculation
is running wild.

781
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:58,390
Do you think these drugs
could affect one's mind?

782
00:33:58,391 --> 00:33:59,592
Now we know.

783
00:33:59,593 --> 00:34:01,595
- Testosterone...
- Steroids...

784
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:06,904
<i>Let's cut through the crap.</i>

785
00:34:06,905 --> 00:34:09,577
<i>This is steroids 101.</i>

786
00:34:09,577 --> 00:34:11,646
<i>First of all,
the term "steroids"</i>

787
00:34:11,648 --> 00:34:15,085
<i>Is often misused to describe
any performance-enhancing drug</i>

788
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:17,356
<i>When in fact
many of these drugs</i>

789
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:19,327
<i>are not actually
steroids at all.</i>

790
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:21,632
<i>So what are steroids?</i>

791
00:34:21,632 --> 00:34:23,635
<i>Well, steroids are
synthetic versions</i>

792
00:34:23,637 --> 00:34:26,340
<i>of hormones that your body
produces naturally,</i>

793
00:34:26,342 --> 00:34:28,344
<i>like cortisone--
that's a steroid.</i>

794
00:34:28,346 --> 00:34:30,916
<i>It signals the body
to break down inflammation.</i>

795
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:32,918
<i>Birth control pills
are steroids too</i>

796
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,755
<i>Made from the female
sex hormones</i>

797
00:34:34,757 --> 00:34:36,592
<i>estrogen
and progesterone.</i>

798
00:34:36,592 --> 00:34:39,130
<i>But the steroids that get
all the negative attention</i>

799
00:34:39,132 --> 00:34:40,800
<i>are anabolic steroids,</i>

800
00:34:40,802 --> 00:34:43,204
<i>Made from the male
sex hormone testosterone</i>

801
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,943
<i>which tells the body to
increase muscle size and strength</i>

802
00:34:45,943 --> 00:34:48,014
<i>and helps to recover
from workouts faster.</i>

803
00:34:48,014 --> 00:34:51,186
<i>Like any drug, anabolic
steroids do have side effects.</i>

804
00:34:51,188 --> 00:34:54,192
<i>And if you abuse them the
side effects will be worse.</i>

805
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:56,329
<i>For men,
they can cause acne,</i>

806
00:34:56,329 --> 00:34:58,365
<i>hair growth,
raised cholesterol,</i>

807
00:34:58,367 --> 00:35:01,003
<i>shrink your testicles
and lower your sperm count,</i>

808
00:35:01,005 --> 00:35:02,974
<i>which could even
make you sterile.</i>

809
00:35:02,974 --> 00:35:04,643
<i>But all of these
side effects</i>

810
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,646
<i>are reversible
when you go off the drugs.</i>

811
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:08,918
<i>Otherwise, steroids
don't cause baldness,</i>

812
00:35:08,918 --> 00:35:10,655
<i>but if it runs
in your family</i>

813
00:35:10,655 --> 00:35:12,391
<i>they might make you
go bald faster.</i>

814
00:35:12,391 --> 00:35:14,596
<i>And they can also cause
gynecomastia,</i>

815
00:35:14,597 --> 00:35:16,733
<i>or what the gym rats call
"bitch tits."</i>

816
00:35:16,733 --> 00:35:19,471
<i>For women, in addition
to acne and hair growth,</i>

817
00:35:19,472 --> 00:35:22,409
<i>steroids can cause a deepened
voice, menstrual problems</i>

818
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,413
<i>and can enlarge
the clitoris.</i>

819
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,416
<i>And some of these
are not reversible.</i>

820
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:28,420
<i>And for kids,
some experts think</i>

821
00:35:28,422 --> 00:35:31,425
<i>steroids can stunt growth by
closing growth plates prematurely.</i>

822
00:35:31,427 --> 00:35:33,496
<i>But that's actually
never been proven.</i>

823
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:37,137
<i>There's also no proof that steroids
cause cancer, kidney failure,</i>

824
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:39,108
<i>and only oral steroids
in high dosages</i>

825
00:35:39,108 --> 00:35:41,143
<i>can cause
liver problems.</i>

826
00:35:41,144 --> 00:35:43,916
<i>And it's true that steroids
can be one of 1000 risk factors</i>

827
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:46,688
<i>that could lead to heart
disease, but then again</i>

828
00:35:46,688 --> 00:35:49,458
<i>low testosterone is
another big risk factor.</i>

829
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,331
<i>And Roid Rage? Steroids
can increase aggression,</i>

830
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:55,469
<i>but that only happens in
about 5% of the population.</i>

831
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:58,710
<i>And even then, they
can't make you psychotic.</i>

832
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,148
<i>And as for the long-term
side effects,</i>

833
00:36:01,148 --> 00:36:04,152
<i>we don't know. No one's
ever done those studies.</i>

834
00:36:04,153 --> 00:36:07,425
At what point do we say
that a behavior is such

835
00:36:07,427 --> 00:36:10,699
that people just shouldn't
be allowed to engage in it?

836
00:36:10,699 --> 00:36:13,135
I mean, we do
allow people

837
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:15,974
to do lots of things
that can hurt themselves.

838
00:36:15,976 --> 00:36:19,146
<i>America's new
junkies-- plastic surgery addicts.</i>

839
00:36:19,148 --> 00:36:21,150
I've had my eyes done,

840
00:36:21,152 --> 00:36:24,123
rhinoplasty, chin cleft,

841
00:36:24,123 --> 00:36:27,463
pectoral implants,
bicep implants,

842
00:36:27,463 --> 00:36:29,900
buttock augmentation.

843
00:36:29,902 --> 00:36:32,271
And those are the ones
I can remember right offhand.

844
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,876
<i>Common sense tells
you this is dangerous and foolish.</i>

845
00:36:34,876 --> 00:36:37,713
<i>You wouldn't risk your neck
in a trick like this.</i>

846
00:36:37,715 --> 00:36:40,251
<i>Common sense tells us that
being shot out of a cannon</i>

847
00:36:40,253 --> 00:36:42,690
<i>Is dangerous business.
Handling dynamite--</i>

848
00:36:42,692 --> 00:36:44,260
<i>This too
looks dangerous.</i>

849
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,898
<i>Whether
it's bungee jumping</i>

850
00:36:46,898 --> 00:36:49,735
<i>or skydiving</i>

851
00:36:49,737 --> 00:36:51,739
<i>or black-diamond
skiing--</i>

852
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,579
<i>All of them
are fun to do</i>

853
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:57,952
But would subject one
to tremendous risks

854
00:36:57,952 --> 00:36:59,922
with no real
necessity.

855
00:36:59,922 --> 00:37:03,862
And so if we allow
all of those other risks,

856
00:37:03,862 --> 00:37:06,400
why is it that we're
taking this position

857
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,403
with respect
to anabolic steroids?

858
00:37:08,405 --> 00:37:12,210
<i>And it's a fair start.</i>

859
00:37:12,211 --> 00:37:14,849
<i>1988, Seoul, Korea.</i>

860
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:17,253
<i>A Canadian sprinter
Ben Johnson</i>

861
00:37:17,255 --> 00:37:19,257
<i>defeated his archrival
Carl Lewis</i>

862
00:37:19,259 --> 00:37:20,994
<i>in the 100-meter sprint</i>

863
00:37:20,994 --> 00:37:23,063
<i>to become the fastest man
in history.</i>

864
00:37:23,065 --> 00:37:24,934
<i>It sure got our spirit up.</i>

865
00:37:24,936 --> 00:37:27,005
Just great.
Hey, Benny!

866
00:37:27,005 --> 00:37:29,175
<i>But 24 hours later</i>

867
00:37:29,175 --> 00:37:31,213
<i>he tested positive
for steroids</i>

868
00:37:31,213 --> 00:37:34,585
<i>and they gave the gold
medal to our guy, Carl Lewis.</i>

869
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:37,356
<i>There was an
international uproar</i>

870
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:40,597
over the idea
that this Canadian sprinter

871
00:37:40,597 --> 00:37:43,668
<i>had gotten an advantage
based on his use</i>

872
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:46,875
<i>of anabolic steroids
for its performance effect.</i>

873
00:37:46,876 --> 00:37:49,545
And Congress responded
by holding some hearings.

874
00:37:49,547 --> 00:37:51,849
Ben Johnson would not
have been in the finals.

875
00:37:51,851 --> 00:37:54,322
He probably would not have
been on the Olympic team

876
00:37:54,322 --> 00:37:56,224
<i>had he not
taken steroids.</i>

877
00:37:56,226 --> 00:37:58,996
<i>Congress wanted to pass
a law that would control steroids</i>

878
00:37:58,998 --> 00:38:01,101
<i>the same way as drugs
like cocaine and heroin</i>

879
00:38:01,101 --> 00:38:03,472
<i>and they called experts
from the D.E.A.,</i>

880
00:38:03,472 --> 00:38:06,711
<i>the F.D.A. and the American
Medical Association.</i>

881
00:38:06,713 --> 00:38:09,516
<i>But they all testified that
steroids should not be treated</i>

882
00:38:09,516 --> 00:38:12,755
<i>like illicit drugs. So Congress
disregarded their experts</i>

883
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:16,762
<i>and in 1990 they passed the
Anabolic Steroid Control Act,</i>

884
00:38:16,764 --> 00:38:20,135
<i>turning non-medical users
into federal drug criminals.</i>

885
00:38:20,137 --> 00:38:23,307
<i>This wasn't so
much about health effects.</i>

886
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:27,315
It was really on what
these things do that's good

887
00:38:27,317 --> 00:38:29,820
in the sense that
they build muscle,

888
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,759
they improve the way
that people can perform.

889
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,429
And that
in a sports context

890
00:38:35,431 --> 00:38:37,501
was seen
as the ultimate evil.

891
00:38:37,501 --> 00:38:40,239
If we took a pie chart
of steroid use

892
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:43,545
and we looked at
what percentage of that pie

893
00:38:43,545 --> 00:38:46,083
<i>is comprised
of athletes</i>

894
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,989
<i>it would be a very very
small slice of that pie.</i>

895
00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:51,760
<i>The overwhelming
majority of the pie</i>

896
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,266
<i>is comprised of the
recreational gym rat</i>

897
00:38:55,268 --> 00:38:57,838
<i>who's doing it purely
for cosmetic reasons.</i>

898
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:00,443
The irony is
that we've addressed

899
00:39:00,443 --> 00:39:02,447
a sports cheating issue

900
00:39:02,447 --> 00:39:04,550
by creating a law

901
00:39:04,552 --> 00:39:07,121
that affects all the folks
who aren't cheating in sports.

902
00:39:07,123 --> 00:39:09,659
<i>One look at
Gregory Valentino's arms</i>

903
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:11,664
<i>and you know
something's going on.</i>

904
00:39:11,664 --> 00:39:14,168
<i>The 40-year-old is charged
with criminal possession</i>

905
00:39:14,168 --> 00:39:16,639
<i>of anabolic steroids
with intent to sell.</i>

906
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:18,744
<i>Some people may
call Gregg Valentino</i>

907
00:39:18,744 --> 00:39:20,880
<i>a freak and a felon.
I call him a neighbor.</i>

908
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,150
<i>He lives down the
block from my grandma.</i>

909
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,588
<i>He also happens to have the
biggest biceps in the world.</i>

910
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,259
Holy crap.

911
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,862
Do you have difficulty
with just sort of

912
00:39:28,862 --> 00:39:31,233
the regular things in life,
like making a sandwich?

913
00:39:31,233 --> 00:39:33,871
No. No no.

914
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,507
I can hit a 90-mile-an-hour
fastball.

915
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:37,177
Any body wants to
challenge me-- let's do it.

916
00:39:37,177 --> 00:39:38,545
<i>I'll show you.
Watch this.</i>

917
00:39:38,547 --> 00:39:41,184
Oh! Oh! Oh!

918
00:39:41,184 --> 00:39:43,188
Come on, Gregg.

919
00:39:43,188 --> 00:39:44,856
Oof!

920
00:39:44,858 --> 00:39:47,862
I told you
I'm no Barry Bonds.

921
00:39:47,864 --> 00:39:51,135
<i>I'm a red-meat man.
I eat a lot of red meat.</i>

922
00:39:51,137 --> 00:39:53,306
<i>Why do you think people
in America are so uptight</i>

923
00:39:53,306 --> 00:39:55,710
<i>About steroids
and steroid users?</i>

924
00:39:55,711 --> 00:39:58,550
Because they fear--

925
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:01,922
they fear
what they don't know.

926
00:40:01,923 --> 00:40:04,693
You know?

927
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:07,298
That's ugly. Who the hell
would want to look like that?

928
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,800
I don't want
to look like that.

929
00:40:08,802 --> 00:40:10,704
Why did you want to look
like that then?

930
00:40:10,706 --> 00:40:13,076
Um, I mean,
I like being big.

931
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,978
<i>I had small-man complex, you know.</i>

932
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,882
<i>I'd be like, "I don't
want to be little."</i>

933
00:40:16,884 --> 00:40:19,755
I wanted to be taller. I couldn't
grow taller, so I grew wider.

934
00:40:19,755 --> 00:40:22,427
<i>Personally I think in the
picture that you showed me--</i>

935
00:40:22,427 --> 00:40:24,630
- Oh, I look better.
- Your arms look a lot better there

936
00:40:24,632 --> 00:40:28,605
- than they look now, right? Wouldn't you agree?
- Without a doubt.

937
00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:30,942
I would rather look like
that. Do you think girls

938
00:40:30,943 --> 00:40:32,911
look at me and go,
"oh My God, that's hot"?

939
00:40:32,913 --> 00:40:35,150
They like...
"that's --ing gross."

940
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:38,356
I walk into a club and the hottest
girl could be there with her boyfriend

941
00:40:38,356 --> 00:40:40,527
and her boyfriend
will see me

942
00:40:40,527 --> 00:40:42,563
and mush her in the face
to get over to me

943
00:40:42,563 --> 00:40:44,867
just to say to me, like,
"dude, what the --?"

944
00:40:44,867 --> 00:40:47,137
You're getting attention from
the guys, not from the girl.

945
00:40:47,139 --> 00:40:49,742
I don't give a shit. It's
attention. I can't explain it to you.

946
00:40:49,744 --> 00:40:52,213
It's like a mindset. Does
that make sense or no?

947
00:40:52,215 --> 00:40:54,217
But I tell you what--
when I'm done

948
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:56,856
my biceps are humongous,
humongous.

949
00:40:56,856 --> 00:40:58,393
Like that-- bam!

950
00:40:58,393 --> 00:41:00,396
For myself, I'm kind of
on the fence.

951
00:41:00,396 --> 00:41:02,400
I have two brothers.
They're both taking steroids

952
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,936
right as we speak
right now.

953
00:41:03,936 --> 00:41:05,940
I don't know
if I want people

954
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,943
to think
I'm not cheating

955
00:41:07,945 --> 00:41:09,880
or to look at me
and say,

956
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,952
"Wow, you know, you
really have a great build."

957
00:41:12,954 --> 00:41:15,990
<i>But do you think I should
take steroids to get there?</i>

958
00:41:15,992 --> 00:41:19,364
I think steroids are
as American as apple pie.

959
00:41:19,364 --> 00:41:21,101
We live in a society
today that--

960
00:41:21,101 --> 00:41:23,606
<i>You got M.T.V.
And reality shows,</i>

961
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:26,043
<i>Madonna's making out
with Britney Spears,</i>

962
00:41:26,043 --> 00:41:28,914
Rap music and all that shit, and
you're worried about steroids?

963
00:41:28,916 --> 00:41:31,385
Kids are like, "--
you, cop. -- you, man,"

964
00:41:31,387 --> 00:41:34,592
<i>Playing video games like grand
theft auto where you're killing cops.</i>

965
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:38,199
That's worse influence in my
opinion than steroids will ever be,

966
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:40,202
<i>than Barry Bonds
hitting home runs.</i>

967
00:41:40,202 --> 00:41:43,141
There's a big difference
between a kid taking steroids

968
00:41:43,141 --> 00:41:45,646
<i>who's only had hair on
his dick a couple of years,</i>

969
00:41:45,646 --> 00:41:48,717
<i>as opposed to a grown man
who's looking to perform better</i>

970
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:50,987
<i>At a better level
in sports.</i>

971
00:41:50,989 --> 00:41:52,992
And where is Schwarzenegger
in all this?

972
00:41:52,992 --> 00:41:54,996
I mean, he is the
poster boy for steroids.

973
00:41:54,996 --> 00:41:57,601
He's the poster boy for "hey,
look, look at me, look what I did.

974
00:41:57,601 --> 00:41:59,637
<i>I came, I conquered,
I kicked ass."</i>

975
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:03,177
That autobiography says he
was doing it when he was 15-16.

976
00:42:03,179 --> 00:42:07,518
<i>Hey, he won Mr. Universe
at 19 years old-- 19.</i>

977
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:09,822
<i>Did you ever see what he
looked like when he was 19?</i>

978
00:42:09,824 --> 00:42:12,061
Do you think it was god-given
genetics or do you think

979
00:42:12,061 --> 00:42:13,965
<i>that maybe he took the
performance enhancers?</i>

980
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:15,967
<i>A lot of people
idolize these guys,</i>

981
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:19,106
<i>whether it's a rock star, a
bodybuilder, a movie star, whoever,</i>

982
00:42:19,108 --> 00:42:21,677
and all of a sudden
you get to meet them

983
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:23,481
and, man,
is it a let-down.

984
00:42:23,483 --> 00:42:27,456
<i>Because they're never ever
what they appear to be.</i>

985
00:42:27,456 --> 00:42:29,460
The guy you see
in public like this

986
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:32,797
has got the middle finger
under the table going like this.

987
00:42:32,798 --> 00:42:35,170
It's never "what you see
is what you get."

988
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:37,407
It's "what you see is
what they want you to see."

989
00:42:37,407 --> 00:42:39,744
Everybody idolized
Schwarzenegger growing up.

990
00:42:39,746 --> 00:42:42,248
<i>Everybody thought,
"man, I wanna lift weights</i>

991
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,253
<i>and life a pure life
like Arnold.</i>

992
00:42:44,253 --> 00:42:47,192
<i>And I'm gonna eat all my vegetables
and take my protein shakes.</i>

993
00:42:47,193 --> 00:42:50,197
<i>Maybe I'll move out to
California, train at Gold's Gym.</i>

994
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:52,434
<i>And I'm gonna get really
big. I'm gonna win contests.</i>

995
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:54,170
<i>I'm gonna be
a movie star too."</i>

996
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:55,807
<i>Please welcome a man</i>

997
00:42:55,809 --> 00:42:59,280
<i>whose story embodies
the American dream.</i>

998
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,284
One thing I learned
about America is

999
00:43:01,284 --> 00:43:04,389
that if you work hard and
if you play by the rules

1000
00:43:04,391 --> 00:43:06,760
this country is truly
open to you.

1001
00:43:06,762 --> 00:43:09,333
You can achieve
anything.

1002
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:12,170
Dude, that is--

1003
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:14,775
That is a pipe dream.

1004
00:43:14,775 --> 00:43:16,778
That is
a pipe dream, okay?

1005
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,782
To get where
Arnold got in life

1006
00:43:18,784 --> 00:43:21,188
you have to be willing
to step on a few fingers

1007
00:43:21,188 --> 00:43:23,893
and step on a few friends
and fuck a few people over.

1008
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:25,661
You don't get to that
level without that.

1009
00:43:25,663 --> 00:43:27,498
In this world you're
either the barracuda

1010
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,003
or you're that little minnow
swimming around like this.

1011
00:43:30,005 --> 00:43:31,572
And Arnold's
the barracuda.

1012
00:43:31,574 --> 00:43:33,677
And we'll all exercise
a little bit together

1013
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:36,849
with the dumbbells. Come on
now, let's do some presses here.

1014
00:43:36,851 --> 00:43:39,086
<i>In the same year
that George Bush Sr. signed</i>

1015
00:43:39,088 --> 00:43:41,992
<i>the Steroid Control Act he
also made Arnold Schwarzenegger</i>

1016
00:43:41,992 --> 00:43:44,864
<i>the chairman of the President's
Council on Physical Fitness.</i>

1017
00:43:44,864 --> 00:43:46,733
<i>So I'm confused.</i>

1018
00:43:46,735 --> 00:43:49,271
<i>Was the President saying
that a former steroid user</i>

1019
00:43:49,273 --> 00:43:50,974
<i>could still be a
role model for kids?</i>

1020
00:43:50,976 --> 00:43:52,311
- Are you gonna exercise?
- Yeah!

1021
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:53,880
We're gonna
pump up muscle!

1022
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:56,284
<i>Enter Steve Rogers,</i>

1023
00:43:56,286 --> 00:43:58,389
<i>Too puny to be
accepted by the army,</i>

1024
00:43:58,389 --> 00:44:01,360
<i>but willing to risk
death for his country.</i>

1025
00:44:01,362 --> 00:44:03,632
He's changing
right before our eyes!

1026
00:44:03,632 --> 00:44:05,635
<i>Suddenly it is over</i>

1027
00:44:05,637 --> 00:44:07,639
<i>and America has
a new champion.</i>

1028
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:10,744
<i>Why do you think in America
superheroes are so important?</i>

1029
00:44:10,746 --> 00:44:12,748
<i>People need heroes,</i>

1030
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,454
<i>Whether in real life
or in fiction,</i>

1031
00:44:15,454 --> 00:44:17,992
because they need somebody
to inspire them,

1032
00:44:17,992 --> 00:44:19,961
something to aim for,

1033
00:44:19,963 --> 00:44:22,266
somebody to try
to be like.

1034
00:44:22,268 --> 00:44:25,505
<i>I think any boy
would want</i>

1035
00:44:25,505 --> 00:44:27,876
<i>to be built like
Arnold Schwarzenegger.</i>

1036
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:31,148
<i>Did you ever want to be
big a muscular like that?</i>

1037
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:33,519
I wanted to be a little--
when I'd go to the beach

1038
00:44:33,521 --> 00:44:36,425
I used to wish that my
arms were a little stronger.

1039
00:44:36,425 --> 00:44:39,130
I looked more like
the 98-lb weakling.

1040
00:44:39,132 --> 00:44:41,534
<i>Did that ever inspire you,
that Charles Atlas comic strip?</i>

1041
00:44:41,536 --> 00:44:44,472
<i>- Did that inspire some of your characters?
- It inspired everybody.</i>

1042
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:46,744
<i>Let me teach
you how to become strong.</i>

1043
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:56,661
When you're young
you get impressions

1044
00:44:56,663 --> 00:44:59,467
That pretty much
last you all your life.

1045
00:44:59,469 --> 00:45:01,871
If you step up
and show up

1046
00:45:01,873 --> 00:45:03,976
and play hard,
you're gonna play.

1047
00:45:03,976 --> 00:45:05,679
All right,
get a break.

1048
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:07,681
Rock 'n' roll, fellas!

1049
00:45:07,682 --> 00:45:09,418
<i>Smelly's now a coach</i>

1050
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,422
<i>for the local high-school
football team.</i>

1051
00:45:11,423 --> 00:45:14,195
<i>Kind of like Arnold, he just
wants to give back to the kids.</i>

1052
00:45:14,195 --> 00:45:16,532
<i>Going to school
was pretty painful for me.</i>

1053
00:45:16,532 --> 00:45:19,304
Oftentimes I can find
the kid who is like me

1054
00:45:19,304 --> 00:45:21,307
<i>and maybe doesn't have
the best confidence</i>

1055
00:45:21,309 --> 00:45:22,943
<i>and show him
how to lift weights</i>

1056
00:45:22,945 --> 00:45:24,545
<i>and build him up
physically and mentally.</i>

1057
00:45:26,784 --> 00:45:28,954
<i>He's the kind of guy</i>

1058
00:45:28,956 --> 00:45:31,693
who would get in your life
and slowly turn it around.

1059
00:45:31,693 --> 00:45:34,030
<i>He keeps me going. He keeps
me motivated about something.</i>

1060
00:45:34,032 --> 00:45:36,001
When he works with those
high school kids

1061
00:45:36,001 --> 00:45:38,938
<i>that's his passion.
Not a lot of kids</i>

1062
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,344
<i>Have a strong male figure
in their life.</i>

1063
00:45:43,784 --> 00:45:46,621
<i>I mean, a lot of people--
they're usually very selfish,</i>

1064
00:45:46,621 --> 00:45:48,958
but he's not. I've never really
met anyone that's like that.

1065
00:45:52,932 --> 00:45:54,534
<i>There's a gym
in Columbus, Ohio,</i>

1066
00:45:54,536 --> 00:45:56,938
<i>Where the strongest guys
in the world train.</i>

1067
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,110
<i>It's called
West Side Barbell.</i>

1068
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:02,550
<i>And this is where Smelly learned
from his role model, Louie Simmons.</i>

1069
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,820
I've got a philosophy like
many-- when you go to war

1070
00:46:04,822 --> 00:46:07,726
you go to kill.
You don't go to get killed.

1071
00:46:07,726 --> 00:46:09,329
There's nobody
in this place

1072
00:46:09,329 --> 00:46:11,298
that's not trying to be the
best athlete in the world.

1073
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:15,440
<i>Everybody here is trying to
achieve an elite level of success.</i>

1074
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,510
Pretty much as you're a kid you
always want to be the strongest.

1075
00:46:17,512 --> 00:46:19,514
I always wanted to be
the strongest guy.

1076
00:46:19,514 --> 00:46:21,952
And I still want
to be that, you know.

1077
00:46:24,391 --> 00:46:26,994
<i>In 1959 my
father showed me a book.</i>

1078
00:46:26,996 --> 00:46:29,164
It was about the Russians
taking testosterone.

1079
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:31,068
So I said,
"what the hell?

1080
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:33,974
<i>First chance I got, I'm gonna
do some of this." and so I did.</i>

1081
00:46:33,974 --> 00:46:36,813
I've actually been on
anabolic steroids for 36 years.

1082
00:46:36,813 --> 00:46:39,418
Matt, Matt, Matt,
Matt, Matt, Matt!

1083
00:46:39,418 --> 00:46:40,286
Up up up up up!

1084
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:45,161
<i>Is it something I
should be morally battling</i>

1085
00:46:45,163 --> 00:46:46,831
<i>or should I be fine
with doing it?</i>

1086
00:46:46,831 --> 00:46:48,835
Your morals are
your morals, not mine.

1087
00:46:48,835 --> 00:46:52,039
Who am I to judge you? And
who are you to judge me?

1088
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:54,778
<i>You want to be strong
or you want to be weak?</i>

1089
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,414
But you can't be strong
without doing steroids?

1090
00:46:56,416 --> 00:46:58,018
You can't be
as strong as possible.

1091
00:46:58,018 --> 00:47:00,724
<i>If you want to reach the top
you're gonna have to do it.</i>

1092
00:47:00,724 --> 00:47:03,594
Everybody thinks anabolic
steroids is the easy way out.

1093
00:47:03,596 --> 00:47:05,898
<i>The people that train
with anabolic steroids</i>

1094
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,737
<i>train way harder
than people that don't.</i>

1095
00:47:07,737 --> 00:47:09,706
<i>Regardless of what people
think of Barry Bonds,</i>

1096
00:47:09,706 --> 00:47:11,777
<i>you can't take
a bottle of testosterone,</i>

1097
00:47:11,777 --> 00:47:13,413
<i>put on Barry's
baseball uniform</i>

1098
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:15,650
<i>and make him hit
700 home runs.</i>

1099
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:18,556
<i>Barry's got to go out, train
and hit the 700 home runs.</i>

1100
00:47:18,556 --> 00:47:20,559
But what if
the scientists came up

1101
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,730
with something better
than anabolic steroids?

1102
00:47:22,731 --> 00:47:25,568
<i>You see cows, you see
immense, powerful cows,</i>

1103
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:28,306
<i>And they basically have
changed their genes.</i>

1104
00:47:28,307 --> 00:47:31,311
<i>If they can change your
genes, would that be illegal?</i>

1105
00:47:31,313 --> 00:47:34,016
What would they do then?
Just ban sports in general?

1106
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:36,021
Oh My Lord.

1107
00:47:39,429 --> 00:47:43,034
When people see these,
is the first question

1108
00:47:43,034 --> 00:47:45,038
<i>"how many hormones
do you pump into them?"</i>

1109
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:46,840
<i>Well, it's two comments.
One would be,</i>

1110
00:47:46,842 --> 00:47:49,411
"oh my gosh, what did you
do to that thing?"

1111
00:47:49,413 --> 00:47:51,583
And secondly, "it looks
like Arnold Schwarzenegger."

1112
00:47:51,583 --> 00:47:53,586
<i>This is a
Belgian Blue Bull--</i>

1113
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:00,231
<i>2600 lbs, all muscle,
all natural.</i>

1114
00:48:00,233 --> 00:48:02,735
So tell me again,
you're all natural?

1115
00:48:02,737 --> 00:48:04,706
You're not
taking anything?

1116
00:48:07,579 --> 00:48:09,548
<i>I think you're ready
for Congress.</i>

1117
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:11,420
<i>He has
a genetic mutation</i>

1118
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:13,690
<i>that allows him to grow
double muscle.</i>

1119
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,460
<i>And scientists
have figured out</i>

1120
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,764
<i>how to genetically alter
humans the same way.</i>

1121
00:48:17,764 --> 00:48:20,101
<i>Dr. Lee Sweeney is
using this technology</i>

1122
00:48:20,103 --> 00:48:21,972
<i>to try to cure
muscular dystrophy.</i>

1123
00:48:21,972 --> 00:48:24,443
It's obviously going to become
more and more evident

1124
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,447
that what we call talent

1125
00:48:26,447 --> 00:48:29,184
<i>is really
genetic variation.</i>

1126
00:48:29,186 --> 00:48:31,655
<i>There's genetic enhancement
available that might be able</i>

1127
00:48:31,657 --> 00:48:34,461
to give you what
nature didn't give you.

1128
00:48:34,463 --> 00:48:37,967
<i>Trying to figure out how
to do it in the safest way</i>

1129
00:48:37,969 --> 00:48:40,005
<i>Is something that
hasn't been worked out.</i>

1130
00:48:40,005 --> 00:48:42,009
<i>If you find out
that it's safe,</i>

1131
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:44,246
<i>would you be somebody
who would say, "hey--"?</i>

1132
00:48:44,246 --> 00:48:45,581
Yeah, I would be
first in line.

1133
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:47,083
'Cause it seems
like this is

1134
00:48:47,085 --> 00:48:49,889
<i>the future of sports--
gene doping.</i>

1135
00:48:49,891 --> 00:48:51,927
Gene doping, yeah.
I wouldn't do it.

1136
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:56,034
<i>Will gene doping ruin
sports in America?</i>

1137
00:48:56,036 --> 00:48:57,838
I don't think so.
I mean, I think

1138
00:48:57,838 --> 00:48:59,842
<i>any time there's
a new technology</i>

1139
00:48:59,842 --> 00:49:02,478
<i>everyone says, "okay,
we have to stand back</i>

1140
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,385
<i>and think about what this is
really gonna mean to society."</i>

1141
00:49:05,385 --> 00:49:07,054
And I think
that's the debate

1142
00:49:07,056 --> 00:49:08,958
we will come to
in the coming decades.

1143
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,929
<i>Good sportsmanship--
you know what that means?</i>

1144
00:49:11,931 --> 00:49:14,300
<i>Play fair.</i>

1145
00:49:14,302 --> 00:49:16,606
<i>When I was a kid
cheating was pretty clear-cut,</i>

1146
00:49:16,606 --> 00:49:19,177
<i>like when the million dollar
man hired the referee's</i>

1147
00:49:19,177 --> 00:49:21,313
<i>evil twin brother to cheat
the Hulkster out of his title.</i>

1148
00:49:21,315 --> 00:49:23,619
<i>Is that Dave
Hebner or is that Dave Hebner?</i>

1149
00:49:23,619 --> 00:49:26,619
You know, cheating in other sports
wasn't all that different.

1150
00:49:27,121 --> 00:49:28,121
Remember when Joe Necro

1151
00:49:27,117 --> 00:49:30,322
<i>was hot-scuffing the ball
with an emery board?</i>

1152
00:49:30,322 --> 00:49:32,157
<i>Something
came out of his pocket.</i>

1153
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,563
<i>Chris: And what about when the
Patriots were playing the Dolphins</i>

1154
00:49:34,563 --> 00:49:36,800
<i>And they hired
an ex-con to clear</i>

1155
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,838
<i>a spot in the snow for
the field-goal kicker?</i>

1156
00:49:38,838 --> 00:49:40,875
<i>You can't do that.</i>

1157
00:49:40,876 --> 00:49:42,610
I think it's
the most unfair thing

1158
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:44,179
that I've ever been
associated in.

1159
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:46,985
<i>Or like when Rosie
Ruiz won the Boston Marathon.</i>

1160
00:49:46,987 --> 00:49:50,157
The mystery woman winner. We
missed her at all our checkpoints.

1161
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:53,164
<i>Why take steroids
when you can take a bus?</i>

1162
00:49:53,164 --> 00:49:54,833
<i>And who can forget
when Tonya Harding</i>

1163
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:58,340
<i>hired a goon to take out
Nancy Kerrigan's knee?</i>

1164
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,344
Why? Why?

1165
00:50:00,344 --> 00:50:02,481
<i>I guess if you can't
beat 'em,</i>

1166
00:50:02,481 --> 00:50:04,451
<i>beat 'em
with a lead pipe.</i>

1167
00:50:04,452 --> 00:50:07,289
<i>But somehow steroids
seem kind of different.</i>

1168
00:50:07,291 --> 00:50:09,860
I thought in undergraduate
school and in college

1169
00:50:09,862 --> 00:50:11,496
I was a pretty good
athlete.

1170
00:50:11,498 --> 00:50:14,269
But I find
myself angry,

1171
00:50:14,271 --> 00:50:17,175
angry in my gut

1172
00:50:17,175 --> 00:50:20,815
because these are the same guys
that would have taken me out,

1173
00:50:20,815 --> 00:50:23,219
taken me out
not because they had

1174
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:26,090
more god-given
natural talent than me

1175
00:50:26,092 --> 00:50:29,998
but because they enhanced
with artificial means.

1176
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,536
<i>If using
steroids is cheating,</i>

1177
00:50:32,536 --> 00:50:35,440
<i>seems like a whole bunch of other
stuff should be cheating too.</i>

1178
00:50:35,442 --> 00:50:38,581
<i>Take Tiger Woods, for example.
He had Lasik eye surgery</i>

1179
00:50:38,581 --> 00:50:41,954
<i>and now his vision is 20/15.
That's better than perfect.</i>

1180
00:50:41,954 --> 00:50:44,557
<i>My eyes are stable.
My game's a lot better.</i>

1181
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,396
I felt pretty good
coming in.

1182
00:50:46,396 --> 00:50:48,565
<i>In a game that relies
so much on depth perception,</i>

1183
00:50:48,565 --> 00:50:52,204
<i>wouldn't superhuman vision
be a performance enhancement?</i>

1184
00:50:52,206 --> 00:50:53,976
<i>Then there's
cortisone shots.</i>

1185
00:50:53,976 --> 00:50:56,246
<i>They helped Curt Schilling
win the World Series.</i>

1186
00:50:56,248 --> 00:50:58,282
<i>And those are
steroids too.</i>

1187
00:50:58,284 --> 00:51:02,324
<i>Truth is, corticosteroids can have worse
side effects than anabolic steroids,</i>

1188
00:51:02,324 --> 00:51:04,661
but they're used
in sports every day.

1189
00:51:04,663 --> 00:51:06,565
He had a 20-minute
cortisone shot

1190
00:51:06,565 --> 00:51:09,170
after Monday's match after
his back tightened up.

1191
00:51:09,172 --> 00:51:11,106
<i>Here's an even
more confusing example--</i>

1192
00:51:11,108 --> 00:51:12,777
<i>Floyd Landis claims</i>

1193
00:51:12,777 --> 00:51:14,947
<i>that he did not take steroids
to win the Tour De France.</i>

1194
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:17,184
<i>Truth is, I
didn't use testosterone</i>

1195
00:51:17,186 --> 00:51:19,021
like I'm accused of doing.
I didn't cheat.

1196
00:51:19,023 --> 00:51:21,226
I didn't do anything
outside of the rules.

1197
00:51:21,226 --> 00:51:24,599
I won the Tour clean
and I deserved to win.

1198
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:26,168
I'm proud of it
and I always will be.

1199
00:51:26,168 --> 00:51:29,273
<i>But he did sleep in
his own altitude chamber.</i>

1200
00:51:29,273 --> 00:51:31,277
I got my
altitude chamber

1201
00:51:31,277 --> 00:51:33,382
out by the garage
these days.

1202
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:35,753
So you made this?

1203
00:51:35,753 --> 00:51:37,655
Yeah, it's not actually
that hard to make.

1204
00:51:37,657 --> 00:51:40,228
I didn't make the pipe. I got the
pipe from some construction site.

1205
00:51:40,228 --> 00:51:41,764
They were putting in
a water main.

1206
00:51:41,764 --> 00:51:43,400
Is the result
pretty good?

1207
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,735
For me it makes
a difference, yeah.

1208
00:51:44,735 --> 00:51:46,773
And how long do you
stay in here for?

1209
00:51:46,773 --> 00:51:49,577
Just sleep in there all night.
I don't know, six or seven hours.

1210
00:51:49,579 --> 00:51:51,581
Is your wife like,
"what are you doing?"

1211
00:51:51,581 --> 00:51:53,585
"I'm gonna sleep
in the chamber."

1212
00:51:53,585 --> 00:51:55,054
She hates it.

1213
00:51:55,056 --> 00:51:56,724
So you just climb
in there?

1214
00:51:56,724 --> 00:51:58,260
Yeah, you want
to try it out?

1215
00:51:58,262 --> 00:52:00,498
You won't have a monitor
in there, but I have it set

1216
00:52:00,498 --> 00:52:01,800
to, like,
about 13,000'.

1217
00:52:04,806 --> 00:52:07,110
<i>See, sleeping
in an altitude chamber</i>

1218
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:09,114
<i>produces a lot more
red blood cells,</i>

1219
00:52:09,114 --> 00:52:11,117
<i>which means more oxygen
in your system,</i>

1220
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:14,556
<i>which means more endurance for a
cyclist or a long-distance runner.</i>

1221
00:52:14,557 --> 00:52:17,429
<i>There are four ways to increase
your red blood cell count.</i>

1222
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:20,768
<i>You can sleep in an
altitude chamber like Floyd</i>

1223
00:52:20,769 --> 00:52:23,507
<i>or you can just train at the
U.S. Olympic training center</i>

1224
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:25,543
<i>at 6,000'
in Colorado.</i>

1225
00:52:25,545 --> 00:52:27,414
<i>Then there's
blood doping.</i>

1226
00:52:27,414 --> 00:52:29,952
<i>That's when you draw your own
blood a month before the big race,</i>

1227
00:52:29,952 --> 00:52:32,088
<i>then re-inject it
the night before.</i>

1228
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:34,494
<i>Finally, there's a drug
called E.P.O.</i>

1229
00:52:34,494 --> 00:52:36,364
<i>which simply
tells your body</i>

1230
00:52:36,364 --> 00:52:38,233
<i>to produce more
red blood cells.</i>

1231
00:52:38,235 --> 00:52:40,570
<i>So that's four ways to
do the exact same thing,</i>

1232
00:52:40,572 --> 00:52:44,244
<i>but two are allowed
and two are cheating.</i>

1233
00:52:44,246 --> 00:52:46,516
You done yet?

1234
00:52:50,023 --> 00:52:52,994
Hey.
That's kind of weird.

1235
00:52:52,996 --> 00:52:55,565
No, it's nice, man. Once you get used
to it it's nice sleeping in there.

1236
00:52:55,567 --> 00:52:57,670
<i>What's heartbreaking
is my eight-year-old--</i>

1237
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:59,606
<i>his two favorite athletes are
Barry Bonds and Lance Armstrong.</i>

1238
00:52:59,606 --> 00:53:01,976
My four-year-old is obsessed
with Floyd Landis.

1239
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:04,114
<i>So what do you tell these kids?
I talk to people all the time</i>

1240
00:53:04,115 --> 00:53:06,085
<i>That they go, "who can
my kids believe in?"</i>

1241
00:53:06,085 --> 00:53:08,255
And I want to tell them
is "nobody."

1242
00:53:08,255 --> 00:53:10,492
I ask not to be judged
and much less

1243
00:53:10,494 --> 00:53:12,429
to be sentenced
by anyone.

1244
00:53:12,431 --> 00:53:15,603
<i>You can't trust anybody now because
the testing is so ineffective.</i>

1245
00:53:15,603 --> 00:53:18,007
You don't know who's really
clean, who's really dirty.

1246
00:53:18,007 --> 00:53:20,945
<i>Were you taking any
sort of drugs for that race?</i>

1247
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:22,949
Not what they
fined me with, no.

1248
00:53:22,951 --> 00:53:25,019
<i>- But you were taking other stuff.
- Other stuff, yeah.</i>

1249
00:53:25,021 --> 00:53:26,690
<i>But isn't that
still cheating?</i>

1250
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:29,393
Still cheating, yeah,
like everybody else.

1251
00:53:29,394 --> 00:53:31,065
<i>So that's how
you justify it--</i>

1252
00:53:31,065 --> 00:53:32,666
<i>- Everybody's cheating?
- Yes.</i>

1253
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:34,570
When I interviewed Ben
Johnson he basically said,

1254
00:53:34,572 --> 00:53:36,273
"look, everybody was
on something."

1255
00:53:36,275 --> 00:53:40,715
Well, you know, Ben--
and bless his heart,

1256
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,784
he's got to say
everyone was on something.

1257
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:45,791
That's justifying
his own means.

1258
00:53:45,791 --> 00:53:47,393
So he has a problem
with you beating--

1259
00:53:47,394 --> 00:53:49,063
he has a problem--
he has a problem

1260
00:53:49,065 --> 00:53:51,501
- of, you know, me beating him.
- Yeah.

1261
00:53:51,503 --> 00:53:53,505
When we were taking
that victory stand,

1262
00:53:53,505 --> 00:53:55,608
we were on the stand
and he got the gold medal,

1263
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:57,914
<i>he didn't smile.
He never smiled.</i>

1264
00:53:57,914 --> 00:53:59,650
<i>He never celebrated.
And the thing is,</i>

1265
00:53:59,652 --> 00:54:02,889
he couldn't really inside share
in the joy of winning. He cheated.

1266
00:54:02,889 --> 00:54:04,893
You cheat.
Everybody cheats.

1267
00:54:04,893 --> 00:54:06,563
Nobody in this world
is perfect.

1268
00:54:06,563 --> 00:54:08,233
Nobody in this life
is perfect-- nobody.

1269
00:54:08,233 --> 00:54:11,840
They know that in 1988
six Americans at least

1270
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,844
tested positive in Seoul.
And they all shut up

1271
00:54:13,844 --> 00:54:16,280
<i>because the biggest money
comes from America.</i>

1272
00:54:16,282 --> 00:54:18,284
So who's gonna
get shafted,

1273
00:54:18,284 --> 00:54:20,288
Americans
or Ben Johnson?

1274
00:54:20,289 --> 00:54:23,260
<i>I think that Ben
Johnson was unfairly singled out.</i>

1275
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,132
<i>I think that there's
always scapegoats.</i>

1276
00:54:26,132 --> 00:54:29,405
<i>Is there a lot of drug use
going on in Olympics?</i>

1277
00:54:29,405 --> 00:54:32,543
Oh, absolutely.
Absolutely.

1278
00:54:32,545 --> 00:54:35,148
<i>Dr. Exum was the
Director of Anti-Doping</i>

1279
00:54:35,148 --> 00:54:37,353
<i>at the U.S. Olympic Committee
for 10 years.</i>

1280
00:54:37,353 --> 00:54:40,057
<i>He thought his job was
to stop drugs in sports,</i>

1281
00:54:40,059 --> 00:54:42,563
<i>but his bosses had
other priorities.</i>

1282
00:54:42,563 --> 00:54:45,300
<i>He told me that over
2000 American athletes</i>

1283
00:54:45,302 --> 00:54:47,871
<i>failed their drug tests,
including Carl Lewis,</i>

1284
00:54:47,873 --> 00:54:49,708
<i>and they were
covered up.</i>

1285
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:51,778
<i>Nobody believes Carl Lewis
ever failed a drug test.</i>

1286
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,615
<i>- Do you have any proof?
- Oh, certainly.</i>

1287
00:54:53,617 --> 00:54:57,188
We have just boxes of proof
for everything that I say.

1288
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:59,193
There it is,
book three.

1289
00:54:59,193 --> 00:55:02,398
Here's a letter from
then Executive Director

1290
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,137
<i>Baaron Pittenger
to Mr. Lewis.</i>

1291
00:55:05,139 --> 00:55:08,175
<i>"I must confirm that the
analysis for your specimen 'B'</i>

1292
00:55:08,177 --> 00:55:11,081
<i>was positive for
pseudoephedrine, ephedrine,</i>

1293
00:55:11,083 --> 00:55:13,519
And phenylpropanolee--
lamine--

1294
00:55:13,521 --> 00:55:15,623
- Is that what is is?
- Phenylpropanolamine, yeah.

1295
00:55:15,623 --> 00:55:17,393
<i>--IOC banned stimulants.</i>

1296
00:55:17,393 --> 00:55:20,398
<i>By policy of the U.S.O.C.,

1297
00:55:20,398 --> 00:55:22,768
<i>for disqualification

1299
00:55:25,876 --> 00:55:28,313
<i>Wow.</i>

1300
00:55:28,313 --> 00:55:30,217
This is basically
a letter that said

1301
00:55:30,217 --> 00:55:31,652
that you had failed
the test

1302
00:55:31,653 --> 00:55:34,458
and that there was a
consequence to that failure.

1303
00:55:34,458 --> 00:55:37,630
As we all know,
that didn't come about.

1304
00:55:37,632 --> 00:55:40,235
You actually received
a letter, or a call--

1305
00:55:40,235 --> 00:55:42,239
- Yes. - --that you had
failed the drug test--

1306
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:44,342
- Right. - --because
of some stimulants?

1307
00:55:44,342 --> 00:55:45,646
Yeah, it was like

1308
00:55:45,646 --> 00:55:47,748
a cold medicine type thing,
the herbal supplement.

1309
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:50,353
They made up this term. It
was called "inadvertent use"--

1310
00:55:50,353 --> 00:55:53,592
<i>an athlete took something
without meaning to take it</i>

1311
00:55:53,594 --> 00:55:57,065
or without meaning to gain
an advantage from taking it.

1312
00:55:57,067 --> 00:55:59,103
<i>Mm-hmm.
And so they made that up</i>

1313
00:55:59,103 --> 00:56:00,940
<i>to basically kind of
let people off the hook?</i>

1314
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,909
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

1315
00:56:02,911 --> 00:56:05,815
Carl's story is--
it's been a cold medicine;

1316
00:56:05,815 --> 00:56:08,320
<i>it's been a tea; it's been
some kind of a nutrient.</i>

1317
00:56:08,322 --> 00:56:10,824
<i>- It's a stimulant. - CHRIS: So
you're saying these athletes--</i>

1318
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:13,262
<i>- they know what's on the banned substance list?
- They totally know.</i>

1319
00:56:13,264 --> 00:56:15,601
They are bombarded with
the banned substance list.

1320
00:56:15,601 --> 00:56:17,603
A lot of people say
you failed the drug test,

1321
00:56:17,605 --> 00:56:19,608
you raced against
Ben Johnson,

1322
00:56:19,608 --> 00:56:23,081
and that maybe--
maybe the gold medal

1323
00:56:23,081 --> 00:56:25,085
- should go to the guy next on the stand.
- I understand.

1324
00:56:25,085 --> 00:56:27,989
There are a lot of people that are
going to go to their graves saying,

1325
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:30,094
"I know he did it." and you
know what? To hell with them.

1326
00:56:32,766 --> 00:56:35,503
<i>You really cannot
fault the athlete for doing that.</i>

1327
00:56:35,503 --> 00:56:39,043
You can't fault Carl
when Carl's belief is

1328
00:56:39,043 --> 00:56:42,181
that the system sets some rules
and that you need to follow them.

1329
00:56:42,182 --> 00:56:44,186
<i>And they made an
exception in his case.</i>

1330
00:56:44,186 --> 00:56:47,324
<i>They made an exception in
a lot of people's cases.</i>

1331
00:56:47,326 --> 00:56:49,496
<i>But it's the system</i>

1332
00:56:49,496 --> 00:56:52,134
<i>that actually teaches
athletes to think that way.</i>

1333
00:56:52,135 --> 00:56:54,137
<i>You know, for me</i>

1334
00:56:54,139 --> 00:56:56,474
<i>the whole "level playing
field" was a myth.</i>

1335
00:56:56,476 --> 00:56:59,815
If we could not do anything
to take doping out of sports

1336
00:56:59,815 --> 00:57:03,255
then doping was
meant to be in sports.

1337
00:57:03,255 --> 00:57:06,960
The first all-drug Olympics
opened today in Bogota, Colombia.

1338
00:57:06,961 --> 00:57:09,900
Athletes are allowed to
take any substance whatsoever

1339
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,471
before, after, and even
during the competition.

1340
00:57:16,179 --> 00:57:18,481
Oh! He's pulled
his arms off!

1341
00:57:18,483 --> 00:57:21,387
He's pulled his arms off. That's got
to be disappointing to the big Russian.

1342
00:57:24,961 --> 00:57:26,965
Yeah!

1343
00:57:26,965 --> 00:57:30,137
What has made
every major sport

1344
00:57:30,137 --> 00:57:32,074
<i>a multi-billion-dollar
entity?</i>

1345
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:34,478
<i>Well, after you
distill it all down,</i>

1346
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,047
<i>it's the desire
of the customer,</i>

1347
00:57:36,048 --> 00:57:39,286
<i>the fans that fill
these seats and others,</i>

1348
00:57:39,288 --> 00:57:42,860
<i>to see bigger-than-life people
doing bigger-than-life things.</i>

1349
00:57:42,862 --> 00:57:45,498
<i>What do you think about
athletes using steroids in sports?</i>

1350
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,670
Steroids?
I love it if they're on my team.

1351
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:49,907
I think it's totally wrong,
totally wrong.

1352
00:57:49,907 --> 00:57:51,543
<i>- Worst offense. Throw them out.
- It's cheating?</i>

1353
00:57:51,543 --> 00:57:53,414
Hell yeah, it's cheating.
Are you kidding me?

1354
00:57:55,351 --> 00:57:57,954
Oh!

1355
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,195
<i>It all gets back to money.</i>

1356
00:58:02,197 --> 00:58:03,965
<i>As long as people
continue to buy</i>

1357
00:58:03,967 --> 00:58:07,005
Mark McGuire shirts,
Barry Bonds hats,

1358
00:58:07,005 --> 00:58:09,409
<i>we're feeding
that monster.</i>

1359
00:58:09,409 --> 00:58:11,914
You vote for the Raiders
by wearing the Raiders hat.

1360
00:58:11,914 --> 00:58:13,684
<i>You cast your vote for
Nike with your T-shirt.</i>

1361
00:58:13,684 --> 00:58:16,255
You know, every day when you
pick a dollar out of your pocket

1362
00:58:16,255 --> 00:58:18,425
you're voting.
And if you don't like

1363
00:58:18,427 --> 00:58:21,764
athletes juicing up, then
don't vote to have that done.

1364
00:58:21,766 --> 00:58:23,936
Don't buy their stuff.
Don't go to the game.

1365
00:58:23,936 --> 00:58:25,940
Do steroids.
Become governor.

1366
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:28,110
Be big and strong,
no girly man.

1367
00:58:28,112 --> 00:58:30,481
- The Giants, baby!
- Whoo!

1368
00:58:30,483 --> 00:58:33,018
Shockey!

1369
00:58:33,019 --> 00:58:34,755
Whoo!

1370
00:58:34,757 --> 00:58:36,525
<i>Since the
steroid scandals broke</i>

1371
00:58:36,527 --> 00:58:38,597
<i>sports revenue has gone
through the roof.</i>

1372
00:58:38,597 --> 00:58:42,070
<i>People are buying more tickets,
T-shirts as souvenirs than ever.</i>

1373
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:44,541
<i>So if this is what we
the people are voting for,</i>

1374
00:58:44,541 --> 00:58:47,112
<i>why did Congress
get involved?</i>

1375
00:58:47,112 --> 00:58:49,349
<i>They always tell you that
if you have a problem,</i>

1376
00:58:49,351 --> 00:58:51,353
<i>Talk to your
Congressman.</i>

1377
00:58:51,353 --> 00:58:54,391
<i>Lucky for me, my
Congressman is Henry Waxman.</i>

1378
00:58:54,393 --> 00:58:56,195
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?

1379
00:58:56,195 --> 00:58:57,731
Very nice to meet you.
Chris Bell.

1380
00:58:57,733 --> 00:58:59,101
<i>He's the one who called</i>

1381
00:58:59,101 --> 00:59:01,103
<i>the baseball hearings
in the first place.</i>

1382
00:59:01,105 --> 00:59:03,108
<i>He's got to have
some answers.</i>

1383
00:59:03,108 --> 00:59:05,112
I think it's important

1384
00:59:05,112 --> 00:59:07,882
for sports figures

1385
00:59:07,884 --> 00:59:10,320
in major league sports

1386
00:59:10,322 --> 00:59:12,324
not to be allowed

1387
00:59:12,326 --> 00:59:15,396
to use steroids
under any circumstance.

1388
00:59:15,398 --> 00:59:17,266
And for young people--

1389
00:59:17,268 --> 00:59:19,905
we certainly don't want
them to be using it.

1390
00:59:19,905 --> 00:59:23,177
So the drug is
a restricted drug.

1391
00:59:23,179 --> 00:59:25,782
It's not--
there's not a--

1392
00:59:25,784 --> 00:59:28,487
Let me--

1393
00:59:28,489 --> 00:59:30,824
Brian, is it illegal
to use--?

1394
00:59:30,826 --> 00:59:32,695
it's illegal--
it's legal

1395
00:59:32,697 --> 00:59:34,364
under some circumstances.
What's--?

1396
00:59:34,365 --> 00:59:36,101
<i>It's legal
with a prescription--</i>

1397
00:59:36,103 --> 00:59:38,373
<i>- legal with-- okay.
- --A medical prescription.</i>

1398
00:59:38,373 --> 00:59:40,242
It's legal with
a medical prescription.

1399
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:42,146
And the other drug
was the...

1400
00:59:42,148 --> 00:59:44,317
testosterone or just
steroids in general.

1401
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:46,688
Well, I think that
they're also banned.

1402
00:59:46,688 --> 00:59:49,293
They're already banned
in professional sports.

1403
00:59:49,293 --> 00:59:51,563
Brian, am I right?
Speak up if I'm wrong.

1404
00:59:51,565 --> 00:59:52,733
<i>- Yes.
- Okay.</i>

1405
00:59:52,733 --> 00:59:55,003
Well, these products
are already banned.

1406
00:59:55,005 --> 00:59:58,108
Cigarettes
and alcohol

1407
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:00,112
are legally
available,

1408
01:00:00,114 --> 01:00:02,918
but not if you're
under the age.

1409
01:00:02,918 --> 01:00:04,922
And I think the age

1410
01:00:04,922 --> 01:00:07,693
is 18 for both
all around the country.

1411
01:00:07,693 --> 01:00:10,865
Is it 18 or 21? I'm
getting confused. What?

1412
01:00:10,867 --> 01:00:12,367
<i>21.
21.</i>

1413
01:00:12,369 --> 01:00:14,306
- Okay, so strike that.
- That's all right.

1414
01:00:14,306 --> 01:00:16,342
<i>President Bush allotted</i>

1415
01:00:16,344 --> 01:00:18,780
<i>$15 million
for steroid education.</i>

1416
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:20,717
<i>Where has
that money gone?</i>

1417
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:23,456
Um, I don't know.

1418
01:00:23,456 --> 01:00:25,927
Do you know?

1419
01:00:25,927 --> 01:00:27,429
Okay, we don't know.

1420
01:00:27,431 --> 01:00:30,268
<i>- Okay.
- So...</i>

1421
01:00:30,268 --> 01:00:32,271
It's a war on drugs

1422
01:00:32,273 --> 01:00:34,309
and Congressmen want
to be tough on drugs,

1423
01:00:34,309 --> 01:00:36,311
so they just
demonize them all.

1424
01:00:36,313 --> 01:00:38,449
And they say, "oh, our children
are being exposed to them.

1425
01:00:38,451 --> 01:00:40,454
They're gonna kill
our children."

1426
01:00:40,454 --> 01:00:42,891
And they just paint
everything in black and white.

1427
01:00:42,893 --> 01:00:45,163
And they really don't
see the areas in between.

1428
01:00:45,164 --> 01:00:47,367
For those of us
who live in the grey areas

1429
01:00:47,367 --> 01:00:49,202
and whose life
depends on it.

1430
01:00:49,204 --> 01:00:50,804
It's a very
important issue.

1431
01:00:50,806 --> 01:00:53,010
Politicians
are always looking

1432
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:55,047
for an issue
to get behind.

1433
01:00:55,047 --> 01:00:56,884
They're always looking
for something

1434
01:00:56,885 --> 01:00:58,719
to be able to say
to the public,

1435
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:00,590
"hey, look at what
my legislation's doing.

1436
01:01:00,592 --> 01:01:01,960
Look at what
my bill has done.

1437
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,831
I'm out there.
I'm protecting you.

1438
01:01:04,831 --> 01:01:06,902
I'm protecting
the children."

1439
01:01:06,902 --> 01:01:09,005
<i>Turns out the
most important witness</i>

1440
01:01:09,007 --> 01:01:11,844
<i>at the baseball hearings
was not a famous athlete.</i>

1441
01:01:11,846 --> 01:01:14,315
<i>Taylor Hooton was
a 17-year-old kid</i>

1442
01:01:14,317 --> 01:01:17,755
<i>who committed suicide and
his father blamed steroids.</i>

1443
01:01:17,755 --> 01:01:20,661
I believe
the poor example

1444
01:01:20,661 --> 01:01:22,998
being set
by professional athletes

1445
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,469
is a major catalyst
fueling

1446
01:01:25,471 --> 01:01:27,840
the high usage of steroids
amongst our kids.

1447
01:01:27,842 --> 01:01:30,077
And parents
across America

1448
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:32,414
should hold you
accountable

1449
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:34,820
for behavior
that inspires our kids

1450
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:37,224
to do things that put
their health at risk

1451
01:01:37,224 --> 01:01:39,228
and that teaches them
that the ethics

1452
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:41,733
we try to teach them
around our kitchen table

1453
01:01:41,733 --> 01:01:44,204
somehow don't apply
to them.

1454
01:01:44,204 --> 01:01:46,208
Please help us to see

1455
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:48,878
that our children's lives
were not lost in vain.

1456
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,617
You have the power
to do something about it

1457
01:01:51,619 --> 01:01:54,456
and we're counting
on you to do so.

1458
01:01:54,456 --> 01:01:56,192
<i>Donald Hooton coming in</i>

1459
01:01:56,193 --> 01:01:57,929
<i>and putting
a human face on it</i>

1460
01:01:57,931 --> 01:02:01,402
was more powerful
than the scientific--

1461
01:02:01,403 --> 01:02:03,706
the statistics
or any of that stuff.

1462
01:02:03,708 --> 01:02:06,378
<i>On average,
5,000 kids a year</i>

<i>commit suicide

1464
01:02:08,416 --> 01:02:11,086
<i>And most parents
never know exactly why.</i>

1465
01:02:11,088 --> 01:02:13,425
<i>I wanted to find out why
Donald Hooton is so sure</i>

1466
01:02:13,425 --> 01:02:16,028
<i>that the answer could
be as simple as steroids.</i>

1467
01:02:23,978 --> 01:02:25,480
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

1468
01:02:25,481 --> 01:02:27,583
- Chris Henry.
- Don Hooton. Nice to meet you.

1469
01:02:27,585 --> 01:02:30,889
This is a very very
competitive community

1470
01:02:30,889 --> 01:02:33,362
all the way from
athletics to business.

1471
01:02:33,362 --> 01:02:36,599
So you wind up
in an affluent area

1472
01:02:36,601 --> 01:02:39,905
where these kids can afford
to play with this stuff.

1473

<i>And of course in
hindsight as we look back,</i>

1474
01:02:42,244 --> 01:02:44,347
<i>all of the signs were
staring us in the face--</i>

1475
01:02:44,349 --> 01:02:46,920
The behavior problems,
the physical changes,

1476
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,190
but we had no idea
what we were looking at.

1477
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:51,159
If we go back
to the medical textbook,

1478
01:02:51,161 --> 01:02:54,065
the depression that comes
along with steroid use is bad,

1479
01:02:54,067 --> 01:02:57,405
<i>but it's worse in that
four-to-six-week period</i>

1480
01:02:57,407 --> 01:02:59,909
<i>following stopping
using this stuff.</i>

1481
01:02:59,911 --> 01:03:02,181
<i>And it was
during that period</i>

1482
01:03:02,181 --> 01:03:04,184
that his mother
found him

1483
01:03:04,184 --> 01:03:06,688
hanging on the door
in his bedroom.

1484
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:08,025
<i>Jeez.</i>

1485
01:03:08,025 --> 01:03:10,027
Taylor Hooton's dad,
Don Hooton,

1486
01:03:10,028 --> 01:03:13,233
called me shortly after

1487
01:03:13,235 --> 01:03:15,806
Taylor had taken
his life.

1488
01:03:15,806 --> 01:03:18,510
Together we came up
with the idea

1489
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:20,614
of creating
a private organization...

1490
01:03:20,615 --> 01:03:22,585
...to educate
the public

1491
01:03:22,585 --> 01:03:24,588
<i>about the dangers</i>

1492
01:03:24,588 --> 01:03:26,891
<i>of anabolic steroid abuse.</i>

1493
01:03:26,893 --> 01:03:28,762
This is Taylor's room.

1494
01:03:28,764 --> 01:03:30,599
You don't have to come
in here long to realize

1495
01:03:30,601 --> 01:03:32,268
Taylor was
a baseball player.

1496
01:03:32,269 --> 01:03:36,309
<i>'Cause he started maybe
five years old in T-ball.</i>

1497
01:03:36,311 --> 01:03:40,351
<i>But Taylor was
a great kid.</i>

1498
01:03:40,351 --> 01:03:42,621
We took Taylor
to a psychiatrist

1499
01:03:42,623 --> 01:03:45,559
<i>and she put him on
a low dose of Lexapro.</i>

1500
01:03:45,561 --> 01:03:48,032
<i>And as far as I know,</i>

1501
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:50,670
this is the only
steroid-related case

1502
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:54,443
that this well-meaning
psychiatrist had ever had.

1503
01:03:54,445 --> 01:03:58,117
And when the psychiatrist
recommended that Taylor go cold turkey

1504
01:03:58,117 --> 01:04:00,454
and stop using steroids...

1505
01:04:02,492 --> 01:04:04,661
it was a formula
for disaster.

1506
01:04:04,663 --> 01:04:07,000
I feel terrible, obviously,
about Taylor Hooton,

1507
01:04:07,001 --> 01:04:09,371
But Taylor Hooton had
a lot of problems

1508
01:04:09,371 --> 01:04:11,375
and he was on other drugs.

1509
01:04:11,376 --> 01:04:13,378
According to some
newspaper accounts,

1510
01:04:13,378 --> 01:04:15,983
he was on S.S.R.I.S--
antidepressants

1511
01:04:15,983 --> 01:04:17,985
which have been shown
to be associated

1512
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:20,891
with suicidal ideation
and suicidal behavior.

1513
01:04:20,893 --> 01:04:23,797
<i>So whether his suicide
was due to Lexapro</i>

1514
01:04:23,797 --> 01:04:25,934
<i>or due to steroids
or due to depression</i>

1515
01:04:25,936 --> 01:04:28,271
<i>or due to stress
of being a great athlete,</i>

1516
01:04:28,273 --> 01:04:30,443
<i>there are five other
things-- I don't know.</i>

1517
01:04:30,443 --> 01:04:32,581
Do you think
that perhaps--

1518
01:04:32,581 --> 01:04:35,385
when I look
at your website,

1519
01:04:35,387 --> 01:04:38,190
The Taylor Hooton
Foundation--

1520
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:40,594
do you think
it's a responsibility

1521
01:04:40,596 --> 01:04:44,402
to include
antidepressants in there

1522
01:04:44,402 --> 01:04:46,405
just in case
there are critics

1523
01:04:46,407 --> 01:04:48,409
or just to raise
the awareness

1524
01:04:48,411 --> 01:04:51,148
of how dangerous perhaps
antidepressants may be?

1525
01:04:51,148 --> 01:04:53,152
No, I don't.
And the reason is,

1526
01:04:53,152 --> 01:04:56,289
our battle is not with antidepressants.
Our battle's with steroids.

1527
01:04:56,291 --> 01:04:59,228
<i>The National Institute
on Drug Abuse said</i>

1528
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:01,233
the dangers
of anabolic steroids

1529
01:05:01,233 --> 01:05:03,704
are temporary
and reversible.

1530
01:05:03,706 --> 01:05:05,708
My son is dead.

1531
01:05:08,012 --> 01:05:11,552
All of the intellectual
arguments

1532
01:05:11,552 --> 01:05:13,021
about whether or not

1533
01:05:13,021 --> 01:05:16,594
steroids are dangerous
or not

1534
01:05:16,594 --> 01:05:18,597
don't matter to me.

1535
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:20,534
I know
they're dangerous.

1536
01:05:20,536 --> 01:05:23,842
<i>I saw it with my own eyes
and I watched my son die.</i>

1537
01:05:23,842 --> 01:05:26,512
The only evidence I need
is the pictures of my son

1538
01:05:26,514 --> 01:05:28,516
that are on the wall
behind you.

1539
01:05:28,516 --> 01:05:29,418
Mm-hmm.

1540
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:34,260
Look, I have a son too.

1541
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:36,931
And the last thing in the
world I could ever imagine doing

1542
01:05:36,932 --> 01:05:38,869
is burying that kid.
And it would probably

1543
01:05:38,869 --> 01:05:40,639
ruin me for the rest
of my life.

1544
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:42,809
And I can see
where having a cause

1545
01:05:42,809 --> 01:05:45,547
to sort of assuage
the feelings of guilt

1546
01:05:45,548 --> 01:05:48,619
and depression that are
following my son's death

1547
01:05:48,621 --> 01:05:51,793
would probably be helpful. "Let's
not let this happen to somebody else."

1548
01:05:51,793 --> 01:05:54,264
But they're chasing
the wrong thing.

1549
01:05:54,264 --> 01:05:55,833
They're not
doing it right.

1550
01:05:55,833 --> 01:05:57,836
We're working
with major league baseball

1551
01:05:57,838 --> 01:05:59,840
to make that happen now

1552
01:05:59,842 --> 01:06:02,411
where hopefully
in each local stadium

1553
01:06:02,413 --> 01:06:04,849
<i>there's gonna be
a steroid awareness night.</i>

1554
01:06:04,851 --> 01:06:06,853
Do you find it
ironic at all

1555
01:06:06,855 --> 01:06:09,891
to have a steroid
awareness night for baseball

1556
01:06:09,893 --> 01:06:11,862
in a stadium
that sells alcohol

1557
01:06:11,864 --> 01:06:14,233
which is responsible for
a lot of deaths as a drug?

1558
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:18,373
Alcohol's legal to sell.

1559
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:20,378
<i>And we can argue
all day long</i>

1560
01:06:20,378 --> 01:06:24,452
<i>Whether tobacco kills
and whether alcohol kills,</i>

1561
01:06:24,452 --> 01:06:26,456
and there's a clear
distinction in my mind

1562
01:06:26,456 --> 01:06:29,228
between tobacco
or alcohol

1563
01:06:29,228 --> 01:06:32,634
and steroids and
methamphetamines and coke.

1564
01:06:32,635 --> 01:06:34,403
- Thanks for sharing that with us.
- All right.

1565
01:06:34,405 --> 01:06:36,306
I know how hard
it can be and everything.

1566
01:06:36,307 --> 01:06:37,409
This is
important stuff.

1567
01:06:52,871 --> 01:06:55,242
<i>Anybody who
asks me about it--</i>

1568
01:06:55,242 --> 01:06:57,079
<i>I let them know.
I tell them why.</i>

1569
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:59,983
<i>I tell them how much I
take. I'll tell them anything</i>

1570
01:06:59,985 --> 01:07:02,989
<i>- they want to ask me about them
'cause I think-- - What about the kids?</i>

1571
01:07:02,990 --> 01:07:05,829
The kids are different
because--

1572
01:07:05,829 --> 01:07:08,465
<i>a couple kids asked me in
front of the whole group</i>

1573
01:07:08,467 --> 01:07:10,070
<i>and I had to lie
about it</i>

1574
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:12,574
because this whole steroid
thing is just out of hand.

1575
01:07:12,576 --> 01:07:14,679
I know coach Henry
doesn't take any steroids.

1576
01:07:14,679 --> 01:07:16,782
He's just 100% strong.

1577
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:19,320
<i>I think somebody asked
him if he was on steroids</i>

1578
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:22,059
and he said no. And I
completely believe him.

1579
01:07:22,059 --> 01:07:24,161
He just teaches that
steroids are basically--

1580
01:07:24,163 --> 01:07:25,998
they're a cheap way
out of doing hard work.

1581
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,369
<i>I say they're not for kids.</i>

1582
01:07:28,371 --> 01:07:31,342
<i>Steroids are not for kids.
That's plain and simple.</i>

1583
01:07:31,342 --> 01:07:33,445
<i>You should achieve
things naturally</i>

1584
01:07:33,447 --> 01:07:35,416
<i>and then maybe you
should think about them</i>

1585
01:07:35,416 --> 01:07:37,018
<i>when you're
an adult.</i>

1586
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:39,023
The main reason why
I don't take steroids

1587
01:07:39,023 --> 01:07:41,527
is 'cause he got it into my
head that I don't need 'em,

1588
01:07:41,528 --> 01:07:44,934
that I got the potential right now as
a teenager to get as strong as I want.

1589
01:07:44,934 --> 01:07:47,572
<i>What good would it do them
to know that I take steroids?</i>

1590
01:07:47,572 --> 01:07:49,976
<i>It wouldn't do them any
good. They'd just be like,</i>

1591
01:07:49,976 --> 01:07:52,347
<i>"oh, man,
he's a cheater.</i>

1592
01:07:52,347 --> 01:07:54,217
<i>Would you ever tell our
parents that you do it?</i>

1593
01:07:54,219 --> 01:07:57,791
Um, I mean, you know,

1594
01:07:57,791 --> 01:07:59,793
if they asked me.

1595
01:07:59,795 --> 01:08:02,733
I only cooked
two pounds.

1596
01:08:02,733 --> 01:08:05,438
I hope it's enough.

1597
01:08:05,438 --> 01:08:07,775
<i>You know, we went
to church all the time.</i>

1598
01:08:07,777 --> 01:08:09,679
I grew up
in a great family.

1599
01:08:09,681 --> 01:08:11,682
I don't think
I could ask

1600
01:08:11,684 --> 01:08:14,086
for anybody better
to be parents, you know.

1601
01:08:14,088 --> 01:08:18,628
And when I went
to the U.S.C.

1602
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:20,699
<i>I didn't do any drugs.
I didn't do anything.</i>

1603
01:08:20,701 --> 01:08:23,003
<i>- 'Cause you're a good boy.
- Well...</i>

1604
01:08:23,005 --> 01:08:25,542
And then I got to a point
where I actually tried steroids.

1605
01:08:25,542 --> 01:08:28,180
<i>I tried Winstrol,
which is injections.</i>

1606
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:30,417
You injected a needle
in yourself?

1607
01:08:30,417 --> 01:08:31,987
<i>It's just
in the muscle.</i>

1608
01:08:31,988 --> 01:08:33,689
Yeah, 'cause you get to
a point where you're like,

1609
01:08:33,690 --> 01:08:35,895
"I'm getting out of shape.
I don't feel like I used to."

1610
01:08:35,895 --> 01:08:37,898
<i>The reason I stopped
doing it was</i>

1611
01:08:37,899 --> 01:08:40,269
<i>because I thought
it was immoral.</i>

1612
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:42,739
<i>I thought it was so wrong
and like,</i>

1613
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:44,944
"what if my parents
found out I did this?"

1614
01:08:44,944 --> 01:08:46,780
I think it's really
hard to hear

1615
01:08:46,782 --> 01:08:49,920
- that you tried 'em and everything, but--
- For you.

1616
01:08:49,921 --> 01:08:51,390
It's not hard
for me.

1617
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:54,627
What I'm saying is
that it's hard to hear.

1618
01:08:54,628 --> 01:08:56,631
And what about mark?
I mean,

1619
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:59,203
how come you're staying big
but you're not getting fat?

1620
01:08:59,203 --> 01:09:01,675
- You're just--
- I'm getting fatter.

1621
01:09:01,676 --> 01:09:03,612
No, but your face
is rounder.

1622
01:09:03,613 --> 01:09:05,783
- I put on body fat.
He's about--

1623
01:09:05,783 --> 01:09:08,554
<i>You're about 7% or 8% higher than what
you normally are, wouldn't you say?</i>

1624
01:09:08,555 --> 01:09:10,256
I have no idea. I don't
really care either.

1625
01:09:10,257 --> 01:09:11,926
<i>He's already
married. He doesn't care.</i>

1626
01:09:11,927 --> 01:09:14,198
Except Smelly's
not saying anything.

1627
01:09:14,198 --> 01:09:16,836
Don't let your brothers
overrun your conversation.

1628
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:21,411
When you get
caught with something

1629
01:09:21,412 --> 01:09:24,751
I think the truth is
always the fastest way

1630
01:09:24,752 --> 01:09:26,453
out of the situation,

1631
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:28,658
but it's not always
the best way out.

1632
01:09:28,658 --> 01:09:30,895
You know, she's concerned.
She's being a mom

1633
01:09:30,895 --> 01:09:35,270
and she's just trying
to leave it open

1634
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:37,606
where I could say, "Yeah,
you know what? I do 'em.

1635
01:09:37,608 --> 01:09:40,779
And this is why." I think
that's what she's looking for.

1636
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:43,318
But she's still
never directly asked me.

1637
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:46,356
So until that time comes
I ain't sayin' nothin'.

1638
01:09:48,127 --> 01:09:50,931
<i>People have a
tendency to cheat at everything.</i>

1639
01:09:50,932 --> 01:09:52,935
<i>And that happens
with taxes too,</i>

1640
01:09:52,935 --> 01:09:55,774
just like it could with
steroids or any other thing.

1641
01:09:55,775 --> 01:10:00,381
It's human nature.
It's the sinful nature of men.

1642
01:10:00,384 --> 01:10:02,153
<i>My dad convinced
mad dog and his wife</i>

1643
01:10:02,154 --> 01:10:04,289
<i>To settle down
in Poughkeepsie.</i>

1644
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:07,061
<i>And he's been doing income taxes for
the same guys he used to wrestle with.</i>

1645
01:10:07,063 --> 01:10:09,533
I keep a couple things
around, not too much.

1646
01:10:09,533 --> 01:10:11,502
Big john.
John always keeps it real.

1647
01:10:11,503 --> 01:10:14,408
This just says "To Mad
Dog. Thanks for everything."

1648
01:10:14,408 --> 01:10:17,680
<i>Not exactly how he
thought his life would turn out.</i>

1649
01:10:17,681 --> 01:10:19,417
<i>I get up, I go to the office,</i>

1650
01:10:19,417 --> 01:10:21,555
you know, I make money for
them, I make money for me.

1651
01:10:21,555 --> 01:10:24,059
<i>I got a great wife.
I got a great family.</i>

1652
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:26,063
But I wanted to be
a famous wrestler

1653
01:10:26,064 --> 01:10:28,467
and, you know,
I wanted to live the life.

1654
01:10:28,469 --> 01:10:31,038
I wanted to be on the road,
travel, meeting people,

1655
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:33,042
Making money,
having fun--

1656
01:10:33,043 --> 01:10:34,912
you know,
living the life.

1657
01:10:34,912 --> 01:10:36,850
<i>He'll break
down and he'll be crying</i>

1658
01:10:36,850 --> 01:10:38,819
<i>and he'll say, like,
"dad, the biggest fear</i>

1659
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:40,823
<i>I ever had in my life
was being average Joe.</i>

1660
01:10:40,823 --> 01:10:43,194
<i>And I'm 36 years old and that's
all I can see for myself."</i>

1661
01:10:43,194 --> 01:10:44,564
<i>What do you want to do now?</i>

1662
01:10:44,564 --> 01:10:47,002
<i>Where do you see
yourself going?</i>

1663
01:10:47,002 --> 01:10:50,742
I mean, you know, the immediate
goal was to get out of Poughkeepsie,

1664
01:10:50,743 --> 01:10:53,980
move to California,
establish my name

1665
01:10:53,981 --> 01:10:58,122
and then start my own
business eventually.

1666
01:10:58,122 --> 01:11:00,493
Seemed like he was making
good progress, okay?

1667
01:11:00,493 --> 01:11:02,029
But he wasn't making
any progress.

1668
01:11:02,029 --> 01:11:03,699
<i>I told him the other night, I said,</i>

1669
01:11:03,701 --> 01:11:06,070
"you might be fooling
everybody else,

1670
01:11:06,072 --> 01:11:07,773
but you're not
fooling me.

1671
01:11:07,774 --> 01:11:09,944
You're full of shit.
You're still on stuff."

1672
01:11:09,944 --> 01:11:12,114
Why do you think he
would tell us about it?

1673
01:11:12,115 --> 01:11:14,786
He tells me everything else,
you know, that he's doing.

1674
01:11:14,787 --> 01:11:16,789
<i>I think he's
partially embarrassed</i>

1675
01:11:16,791 --> 01:11:19,895
and I think he's--

1676
01:11:19,895 --> 01:11:22,233
that's part of
addictive behavior.

1677
01:11:22,234 --> 01:11:25,605
<i>His thing is this-- "I'm gonna be
fine as soon as I'm out of here.</i>

1678
01:11:25,606 --> 01:11:28,543
<i>I'm gonna go live in California.
My life is gonna be perfect."</i>

1679
01:11:28,545 --> 01:11:32,118
<i>But if he really believes that--
no, he's not gonna be fine at all.</i>

1680
01:11:32,118 --> 01:11:34,856
You know who I feel bad
for? I feel bad for Nadine.

1681
01:11:34,858 --> 01:11:36,926
'Cause here's a young
girl who's married,

1682
01:11:36,926 --> 01:11:39,966
<i>whose hopes and dreams
and life</i>

1683
01:11:39,966 --> 01:11:42,904
<i>is in him,
and he's a screw-up.</i>

1684
01:11:42,904 --> 01:11:46,310
And if he ends up overdosing
and killing himself

1685
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:49,082
<i>or if he ends up on the rocks,
he's taking her with him.</i>

1686
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:51,953
I'm not moving out there
with the hopes and dreams of--

1687
01:11:51,954 --> 01:11:54,359
I'm not gonna wait tables and
hope I'm gonna be an actor.

1688
01:11:54,359 --> 01:11:56,128
I already did that--
15 years of wrestling.

1689
01:11:56,130 --> 01:11:57,497
<i>You think
you'll get noticed?</i>

1690
01:11:57,498 --> 01:11:59,534
I'm not moving out
to get noticed,

1691
01:11:59,536 --> 01:12:01,572
but you're never gonna get
noticed in Poughkeepsie.

1692
01:12:01,573 --> 01:12:04,010
In Hollywood you're walking down
the street, somebody sees you--

1693
01:12:04,011 --> 01:12:05,979
"hey, you got a minute?"
you just never know.

1694
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:07,984
<i>You don't think
there's any way</i>

1695
01:12:07,984 --> 01:12:09,987
<i>he can get past it?</i>

1696
01:12:09,988 --> 01:12:12,225
A miracle.

1697
01:12:14,564 --> 01:12:17,234
I'm serious.

1698
01:12:17,234 --> 01:12:19,738
I think they're gonna
find him dead someday.

1699
01:12:19,739 --> 01:12:23,278
I thought bringing up boys--
this is easy.

1700
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:26,051
At least I don't have
a daughter who's, like,

1701
01:12:26,051 --> 01:12:28,154
got her face in the bowl
throwing up.

1702
01:12:28,154 --> 01:12:31,260
You know, did I--
did I do something

1703
01:12:31,261 --> 01:12:33,264
as a mother

1704
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:35,801
To make you feel,

1705
01:12:35,802 --> 01:12:37,537
like, not good enough?

1706
01:12:37,538 --> 01:12:40,543
<i>When Mike went off to college
and he calls your father up</i>

1707
01:12:40,545 --> 01:12:42,012
<i>and says,
"can I try steroids?"</i>

1708
01:12:42,014 --> 01:12:45,653
"No, you're not getting
money to try steroids."

1709
01:12:45,654 --> 01:12:50,395
You know, we both thought
that was a crazy thing, so--

1710
01:12:50,395 --> 01:12:52,533
<i>but do you know where he
ended up getting 'em from?</i>

1711
01:12:52,533 --> 01:12:55,438
- No, but I wasn't gonna-- - He
got 'em from your brother John.

1712
01:12:55,439 --> 01:12:56,841
No--

1713
01:12:59,212 --> 01:13:01,615
<i>So that's-- I mean, it's
something that's like,</i>

1714
01:13:01,617 --> 01:13:03,618
<i>you know,
in our family.</i>

1715
01:13:03,619 --> 01:13:05,622
<i>I mean, it's something
that, like--</i>

1716
01:13:05,623 --> 01:13:08,127
Chris, you're already
killing me with this as it is.

1717
01:13:08,128 --> 01:13:10,032
<i>- Well, I'm telling--
- It just gets worse.</i>

1718
01:13:10,033 --> 01:13:11,701
<i>I'm just telling you
the truth.</i>

1719
01:13:11,702 --> 01:13:14,439
I'm just trying to tell
you how I feel as a mother.

1720
01:13:14,439 --> 01:13:17,043
I am broken
to my soul.

1721
01:13:17,045 --> 01:13:18,713
My heart is broken.

1722
01:13:20,417 --> 01:13:22,421
<i>When you were growing up
Hulk Hogan--</i>

1723
01:13:22,421 --> 01:13:24,492
<i>look what he's saying.
"take your vitamins,</i>

1724
01:13:24,493 --> 01:13:26,695
<i>say your prayers--"
and what?</i>

1725
01:13:26,697 --> 01:13:28,998
- "believe in yourself."
- Yeah, but it's not true.

1726
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,738
- So I started working out.
- "Take your steroids," okay?

1727
01:13:31,738 --> 01:13:34,176
I don't know if he
ever prays or not.

1728
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:38,082
Never heard him talk about
god in his whole life, okay?

1729
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:40,087
Now that time
has gone by,

1730
01:13:40,087 --> 01:13:41,989
I'm like,
"is this guy a fraud?"

1731
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:44,529
And that's where I think
that everybody needs

1732
01:13:44,529 --> 01:13:47,567
to begin to accept--
"I am who I am,"

1733
01:13:47,568 --> 01:13:49,537
said Popeye
the sailor man.

1734
01:13:49,538 --> 01:13:51,573
He even was a gyp.

1735
01:13:51,574 --> 01:13:54,180
- He had to take spinach.
- He had to take spinach.

1736
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:56,684
<i>Everybody needs something.
I mean, what's up with that?</i>

1737
01:13:56,685 --> 01:13:59,555
If I just accept who I am right
now, isn't that just giving up?

1738
01:13:59,556 --> 01:14:01,827
No, accept who you are
as a person.

1739
01:14:01,828 --> 01:14:03,997
Then your body image
is something different.

1740
01:14:03,997 --> 01:14:06,502
Do you think a fat person
hasn't tried everything

1741
01:14:06,502 --> 01:14:09,172
that's legal? But I'm
not gonna cross the line.

1742
01:14:09,173 --> 01:14:12,445
<i>The Bible lays everything out
about how to live your life.</i>

1743
01:14:12,447 --> 01:14:14,684
<i>- But the bible can't solve all your problems.
- It can.</i>

1744
01:14:14,685 --> 01:14:17,588
I can't pray to look like Arnold
Schwarzenegger. It's not gonna happen.

1745
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:20,226
No, you can't pray to look
like Arnold Schwarzenegger,

1746
01:14:20,228 --> 01:14:22,230
but neither can you
take enough steroids

1747
01:14:22,231 --> 01:14:25,170
or enough human growth hormone
to look like him either.

1748
01:14:25,171 --> 01:14:27,573
- But you can get as close as you can.
- It's not gonna happen.

1749
01:14:27,574 --> 01:14:30,311
You're fearfully
and wonderfully made.

1750
01:14:30,313 --> 01:14:33,851
Every sinew in your body,
every muscle, every fiber

1751
01:14:33,853 --> 01:14:36,256
was made by god.
And you're exactly

1752
01:14:36,257 --> 01:14:38,261
<i>who he intended you
to be.</i>

1753
01:14:38,261 --> 01:14:41,399
<i>And so what? To somebody
with a six-pack of abs.</i>

1754
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:43,403
Maybe they don't have
what you have.

1755
01:14:43,404 --> 01:14:46,542
I mean, you know, why don't
you ever think that way too?

1756
01:14:46,543 --> 01:14:49,780
What I don't get is
why did our boys

1757
01:14:49,782 --> 01:14:52,819
Not feel that they were
good enough?

1758
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:59,265
My father or my grandfather

1759
01:14:59,265 --> 01:15:01,235
never worried about

1760
01:15:01,237 --> 01:15:03,239
whether they had a six-pack
of abdominals

1761
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,711
or what percentage
of body fat they had.

1762
01:15:05,712 --> 01:15:09,784
So why is it now
in the 21st century

1763
01:15:09,786 --> 01:15:11,921
that there's this
huge preoccupation

1764
01:15:11,922 --> 01:15:14,060
with body image that
just didn't exist before?

1765
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:16,764
<i>Dr. Harrison
pope is a psychiatrist</i>

1766
01:15:16,765 --> 01:15:20,304
<i>who studies why American men are
becoming more obsessed with their bodies.</i>

1767
01:15:20,305 --> 01:15:23,109
So here
we have G.I. Joe

1768
01:15:23,109 --> 01:15:25,412
from the 1960s.

1769
01:15:25,413 --> 01:15:28,118
This is when he first came out
at the time of the Vietnam war.

1770
01:15:28,118 --> 01:15:30,256
He's a perfectly
normal-looking dude.

1771
01:15:30,256 --> 01:15:33,694
Here is G.I. Joe
from about 10 years later,

1772
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:35,532
- from the mid-1970s.
- He's got abs now.

1773
01:15:35,533 --> 01:15:38,136
He's clearly been putting
in some time in the gym.

1774
01:15:38,137 --> 01:15:41,976
- And then here is G.I. Joe from the 1990s.
- Oh, jeez.

1775
01:15:41,978 --> 01:15:44,814
The bicep is
up to 16" or so,

1776
01:15:44,815 --> 01:15:46,853
full six-pack of abs,

1777
01:15:46,854 --> 01:15:49,090
even got serratus muscles
visible on the side.

1778
01:15:49,091 --> 01:15:51,094
This evolution
in the action figures

1779
01:15:51,095 --> 01:15:53,332
is a testimony

1780
01:15:53,332 --> 01:15:56,002
to this increased
preoccupation with body image

1781
01:15:56,003 --> 01:15:58,106
that we've been seeing
in the United States.

1782
01:15:58,108 --> 01:16:00,478
And it's funny
that in our culture

1783
01:16:00,479 --> 01:16:03,417
we still tend
to romanticize

1784
01:16:03,417 --> 01:16:05,421
steroids
to a certain way--

1785
01:16:05,421 --> 01:16:08,559
That you'll see an ad
for an S.U.V. that says,

1786
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,997
"this is our sedan
on steroids."

1787
01:16:10,997 --> 01:16:13,068
But you wouldn't see an
ad for an S.U.V. saying,

1788
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:14,971
"this is our sedan
on cocaine."

1789
01:16:14,972 --> 01:16:18,042
<i>Well, it's sort of
like a golf cart on steroids.</i>

1790
01:16:18,043 --> 01:16:20,815
It looked like an
easy-bake oven on steroids.

1791
01:16:20,817 --> 01:16:22,685
It's sort of
the economy on steroids.

1792
01:16:22,685 --> 01:16:24,456
Think of it as Apollo
on steroids.

1793
01:16:24,457 --> 01:16:27,060
This year the jet stream
has really been on steroids.

1794
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:30,667
Kosovo would be
Bosnia on steroids.

1795
01:16:30,667 --> 01:16:32,871
<i>Adding more U.S.
trainers and advisors,</i>

1796
01:16:32,872 --> 01:16:35,576
<i>essentially putting the
current strategy on steroids.</i>

1797
01:16:35,577 --> 01:16:38,480
We are besieged
every day

1798
01:16:38,481 --> 01:16:42,555
<i>with images of muscular
male bodies on T.V.,</i>

1799
01:16:42,555 --> 01:16:45,027
<i>in the movies, in cartoons,
on magazines</i>

1800
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:46,935
at the checkout counter
in the department store,

1801
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:49,895
<i>all of which seem
to give this message</i>

1802
01:16:51,195 --> 01:16:54,155
<i>that a real man
is big and muscular.</i>

1803
01:17:00,203 --> 01:17:01,996
There you go.
Just like that.

1804
01:17:01,997 --> 01:17:04,581
Good. Give me some good
abs, Christian. That's it.

1805
01:17:04,582 --> 01:17:06,667
I saw "Conan the Barbarian"
when I was 11.

1806
01:17:06,667 --> 01:17:09,543
And at that moment I said,
"that's exactly what I want to do."

1807
01:17:09,545 --> 01:17:11,962
And I started to study
Arnold and his achievements.

1808
01:17:11,963 --> 01:17:13,965
So I started training
with weights when I was 14.

1809
01:17:13,966 --> 01:17:15,675
I started taking
steroids when I was 16.

1810
01:17:15,676 --> 01:17:17,759
<i>So you're advertising
a supplement.</i>

1811
01:17:17,761 --> 01:17:19,886
<i>So a guy like me goes
and looks in the magazine</i>

1812
01:17:19,887 --> 01:17:22,055
<i>and I see Christian Boeving
and I'm like, "wow, man,</i>

1813
01:17:22,055 --> 01:17:24,224
I wanna look like that guy."
so I go and take

1814
01:17:24,225 --> 01:17:26,350
<i>Hydroxycut
or some supplement</i>

1815
01:17:26,351 --> 01:17:28,936
<i>because I think that
I'm gonna look like you.</i>

1816
01:17:28,938 --> 01:17:31,229
But what I don't know is
that you were taking steroids.

1817
01:17:31,231 --> 01:17:33,189
Do you have
any problem with that?

1818
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:36,775
That's a double-edged
sword, my friend.

1819
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:38,737
How to answer this?

1820
01:17:38,738 --> 01:17:40,738
<i>Somebody looks at an ad
with me in it</i>

1821
01:17:40,738 --> 01:17:43,032
and says, "Christian
Boeving takes Hydroxycut,"

1822
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:45,033
Which I did
and I do.

1823
01:17:45,034 --> 01:17:47,577
That doesn't necessarily mean
that I don't take something else.

1824
01:17:47,578 --> 01:17:49,371
If they choose
to believe

1825
01:17:49,372 --> 01:17:51,747
that that's the only thing
I'm taking to look like that,

1826
01:17:51,748 --> 01:17:53,707
then so be it. They should
be smarter than that.

1827
01:17:53,708 --> 01:17:56,252
Is it misleading?
Possibly a little bit, yeah.

1828
01:17:56,253 --> 01:17:59,338
But is it a lie?
Absolutely not.

1829
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:01,756
I'd say probably 80% to
90%-- I'm not kidding you--

1830
01:18:01,757 --> 01:18:03,716
of all the stuff
I see in magazines

1831
01:18:03,717 --> 01:18:06,552
is complete hogwash.
It's ridiculous to me.

1832
01:18:06,554 --> 01:18:09,596
<i>I don't understand why there's
this need in advertising</i>

1833
01:18:09,599 --> 01:18:11,390
<i>To really
manipulate things--</i>

1834
01:18:11,391 --> 01:18:13,391
<i>The bone-thin
fashion models</i>

1835
01:18:13,393 --> 01:18:15,435
<i>that got all kinds
of eating disorders,</i>

1836
01:18:15,436 --> 01:18:16,854
<i>and with men
it's the opposite.</i>

1837
01:18:16,854 --> 01:18:18,773
<i>They get
the Adonis complex.</i>

1838
01:18:18,774 --> 01:18:20,981
<i>And then there's all
kinds of trouble ahead</i>

1839
01:18:20,984 --> 01:18:23,943
'cause you have all these kids who
are like you and me when we were young

1840
01:18:23,944 --> 01:18:26,654
<i>looking at all these people
and they're perfect.</i>

1841
01:18:26,655 --> 01:18:29,614
And how does that make somebody
feel who's not as perfect

1842
01:18:29,615 --> 01:18:30,949
as the people they're
seeing? Not very good.

1843
01:18:32,493 --> 01:18:34,536
So this stuff
I've tried--

1844
01:18:34,537 --> 01:18:36,121
loaded with sugar.

1845
01:18:36,122 --> 01:18:38,914
I've tried this.
I've tried this.

1846
01:18:38,917 --> 01:18:40,167
Of course I've
tried this.

1847
01:18:40,167 --> 01:18:41,751
Everybody I think's
tried muscle milk.

1848
01:18:41,752 --> 01:18:43,545
I've tried this.
I've tried this.

1849
01:18:43,546 --> 01:18:45,255
I've tried
all these drinks.

1850
01:18:45,256 --> 01:18:48,172
If speed stack weren't enough,
you have extreme speed stack.

1851
01:18:48,173 --> 01:18:50,300
<i>The supplement
industry is very unregulated.</i>

1852
01:18:50,301 --> 01:18:52,219
You don't have to have
F.D.A. approval

1853
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:53,929
To come out with
a dietary supplement.

1854
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:56,096
<i>That gives people room
to come out</i>

1855
01:18:56,099 --> 01:18:58,475
<i>with some lower-quality
products.</i>

1856
01:18:58,475 --> 01:19:01,226
This product says
"new legal formula" on it.

1857
01:19:01,228 --> 01:19:03,688
I don't know what
the old formula really had in it.

1858
01:19:03,689 --> 01:19:05,564
"Belizean Man Vine
Extract."

1859
01:19:05,564 --> 01:19:07,356
I don't
want any part of that.

1860
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:09,859
"Best if used by date and
lot number on bottom of can."

1861
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:11,152
Yeah.

1862
01:19:13,197 --> 01:19:15,029
<i>I always thought
the health industry</i>

1863
01:19:15,032 --> 01:19:16,948
<i>was about,
you know, health.</i>

1864
01:19:16,949 --> 01:19:19,034
<i>Why does it feel like
we're back in the wild west?</i>

1865
01:19:19,036 --> 01:19:20,661
It'll clean your teeth
and curl your hair!

1866
01:19:20,662 --> 01:19:22,078
<i>The best in the west.</i>

1867
01:19:22,078 --> 01:19:23,956
I wouldn't be dead
without a bottle.

1868
01:19:23,957 --> 01:19:27,541
<i>Well, we can all thank the
senator from Utah, Orrin Hatch.</i>

1869
01:19:27,542 --> 01:19:29,627
Look how good he looks.

1870
01:19:29,628 --> 01:19:31,921
I want to get his brand
is what I want to do.

1871
01:19:31,921 --> 01:19:34,716
<i>See, the health industry
is big business in Utah.</i>

1872
01:19:34,716 --> 01:19:38,092
<i>They make almost a quarter of all
the dietary supplements in America.</i>

1873
01:19:38,094 --> 01:19:40,761
<i>And supplements are
a $24-billion industry.</i>

1874
01:19:40,764 --> 01:19:42,721
<i>So you do the math.</i>

1875
01:19:42,722 --> 01:19:45,724
<i>Making supplements used to be
like making prescription drugs.</i>

1876
01:19:45,725 --> 01:19:47,976
<i>You had to prove your
product was safe and effective</i>

1877
01:19:47,978 --> 01:19:51,313
<i>before you could sell it. Well,
the supplement cowboys in Utah</i>

1878
01:19:51,314 --> 01:19:53,439
<i>thought that was
a real hassle.</i>

1879
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:56,317
<i>So they asked their favorite
senator to change the rules around.</i>

1880
01:19:56,318 --> 01:19:58,862
<i>And now you don't have to prove
your product is safe at all.</i>

1881
01:19:58,863 --> 01:20:00,738
<i>And the F.D.A. has to prove
that it's not safe</i>

1882
01:20:00,738 --> 01:20:03,198
<i>If they want to take it
off the market.</i>

1883
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:04,699
What is this
red goop?

1884
01:20:04,701 --> 01:20:07,411
This is the Canadian version
of redline.

1885
01:20:07,412 --> 01:20:10,913
We had to take out some of the
ingredients that aren't legal in Canada.

1886
01:20:10,914 --> 01:20:14,250
<i>Thanks to this deregulation,
the supplement industry exploded</i>

1887
01:20:14,251 --> 01:20:18,087
<i>And all sorts of new and interesting
people got in on the action.</i>

1888
01:20:18,087 --> 01:20:20,171
We were always a good team,
whether we were selling drugs

1889
01:20:20,172 --> 01:20:22,090
or whether we were selling
a supplement like we are now.

1890
01:20:22,091 --> 01:20:25,051
"Jekyll & Hyde" supplements,
formulated to awaken your other side.

1891
01:20:25,052 --> 01:20:27,345
Take this and all of a sudden
you become the freak, the monster.

1892
01:20:27,345 --> 01:20:29,346
Everybody wants
to become a monster.

1893
01:20:29,347 --> 01:20:32,266
<i>If Valentino can make a
supplement I bet anyone can do it.</i>

1894
01:20:32,268 --> 01:20:34,059
Hola.

1895
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:36,729
- How many guys you need?
- I need two guys.

1896
01:20:36,729 --> 01:20:38,604
<i>- We're making dietary
supplements. - Uh-huh.</i>

1897
01:20:38,605 --> 01:20:40,815
<i>And I just need a hand with a
couple things. It'd be really easy.</i>

1898
01:20:43,194 --> 01:20:45,028
All I need you guys to do
is take the white--

1899
01:20:45,029 --> 01:20:45,862
Put inside?
Boom.

1900
01:20:48,865 --> 01:20:51,908
<i>First you buy a bunch
of really popular ingredients.</i>

1901
01:20:51,909 --> 01:20:53,868
<i>But the trick is
I'm just gonna use</i>

1902
01:20:53,871 --> 01:20:56,203
<i>- a tiny amount of each one.
- Oof.</i>

1903
01:20:56,204 --> 01:20:59,623
<i>It's what we like to call in the
supplement biz "pixie dusting."</i>

1904
01:20:59,625 --> 01:21:01,458
<i>See, I can hide
my secret formula</i>

1905
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:03,461
<i>behind the term
"proprietary blend"</i>

1906
01:21:03,462 --> 01:21:05,503
<i>and not reveal
that it's pretty much</i>

1907
01:21:05,506 --> 01:21:08,215
<i>just a pillful
of rice flour.</i>

1908
01:21:08,216 --> 01:21:11,217
It's a good way to make a lot of money.

1909
01:21:11,219 --> 01:21:13,554
<i>Don't sneeze
in the supplements here.</i>

1910
01:21:15,515 --> 01:21:18,140
<i>But with all those
expensive ingredients on the label</i>

1911
01:21:18,141 --> 01:21:20,725
<i>I can make this bottle
for about a buck 40</i>

1912
01:21:20,728 --> 01:21:22,978
<i>and sell it for $60.</i>

1913
01:21:22,979 --> 01:21:25,354
<i>Thanks, Orrin.</i>

1914
01:21:25,355 --> 01:21:27,481
We're in the supplement
business now.

1915
01:21:27,483 --> 01:21:30,484
<i>The scary part is that
everything I just did is by the book--</i>

1916
01:21:30,484 --> 01:21:33,113
<i>Well, except for the
illegal-immigrant day laborers.</i>

1917
01:21:33,113 --> 01:21:36,323
<i>But hey, nobody's
regulating them either.</i>

1918
01:21:36,324 --> 01:21:38,826
<i>Now I just need a
misleading advertisement.</i>

1919
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:41,284
Do you airbrush these guys a lot
when you put them in magazines?

1920
01:21:41,287 --> 01:21:43,537
Definitely. There's all
kinds of techniques and tools

1921
01:21:43,538 --> 01:21:45,914
<i>you can use to completely
manipulate the body.</i>

1922
01:21:45,916 --> 01:21:48,710
- Really? - In fact, some of the
"before" and "after" pictures--

1923
01:21:48,711 --> 01:21:50,962
They could be done
on the same day.

1924
01:21:50,962 --> 01:21:52,628
<i>You haven't shot them in the
same day, though, have you?</i>

1925
01:21:52,631 --> 01:21:54,631
- I have, actually.
- Oh, you have?

1926
01:21:54,632 --> 01:21:56,550
- Yeah.
- What do they do--?

1927
01:21:56,551 --> 01:21:59,219
Is this the self-editing part?
I should keep my mouth shut?

1928
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:01,261
I could take anybody and
take a picture of them,

1929
01:22:01,262 --> 01:22:02,554
make them look
their worst...

1930
01:22:02,555 --> 01:22:05,265
think horrible thoughts,
depression.

1931
01:22:07,353 --> 01:22:09,601
...and then through
all kinds of ways

1932
01:22:09,604 --> 01:22:11,061
make them look
their best.

1933
01:22:11,063 --> 01:22:13,398
Just don't
cut my nipple off.

1934
01:22:16,359 --> 01:22:18,359
Agh!

1935
01:22:19,570 --> 01:22:21,697
All right. Let me see here. Good.

1936
01:22:21,698 --> 01:22:23,490
<i>One, two, three.</i>

1937
01:22:23,492 --> 01:22:24,992
Good.

1938
01:22:24,993 --> 01:22:26,702
We can take it
a step further if we want

1939
01:22:26,703 --> 01:22:28,537
in the befores
and the afters.

1940
01:22:28,537 --> 01:22:30,162
<i>Basically, you can
take somebody</i>

1941
01:22:30,163 --> 01:22:31,914
<i>and make them a little
fatter or shorter.</i>

1942
01:22:31,916 --> 01:22:33,416
<i>Are people falling
for this?</i>

1943
01:22:33,417 --> 01:22:35,335
<i>They fall for it
all the time.</i>

1944
01:22:35,336 --> 01:22:38,087
And it's beyond
what I can understand

1945
01:22:38,087 --> 01:22:40,088
because it looks
so silly to me,

1946
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:42,173
<i>but of course I'm somebody
who's had sort of an inside,</i>

1947
01:22:42,175 --> 01:22:44,716
<i>backstage pass to what's
really occurred,</i>

1948
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:47,552
<i>and I've been part of some of
these scams that have played out.</i>

1949
01:22:47,554 --> 01:22:49,680
<i>So if unregulated
dietary supplements</i>

1950
01:22:49,681 --> 01:22:51,556
<i>are marketed like steroids</i>

1951
01:22:51,557 --> 01:22:54,100
and sold by people
who are on steroids,

1952
01:22:54,103 --> 01:22:57,186
<i>is it any wonder that so many people
are just taking the real thing?</i>

1953
01:22:57,188 --> 01:22:59,646
<i>I mean, it's not like
they're hard to get.</i>

1954
01:22:59,648 --> 01:23:02,899
<i>You can cross the border and buy
them from a pet store in Mexico.</i>

1955
01:23:02,902 --> 01:23:05,610
Testosterona, $15.

1956
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:07,029
But it's for your dog,
right?

1957
01:23:07,029 --> 01:23:08,738
Oh, it's for my dog.
Yeah, I forgot.

1958
01:23:08,739 --> 01:23:11,033
Yeah yeah,
my dog's anemic.

1959
01:23:11,033 --> 01:23:13,327
<i>Or you can buy them
on the internet like Mad Dog.</i>

1960
01:23:13,328 --> 01:23:15,828
If you order online you can
get the shit for $250 a kit

1961
01:23:15,829 --> 01:23:19,206
Instead of paying somebody on the
black market $500 or $600 for a kit.

1962
01:23:19,207 --> 01:23:22,126
<i>Or, if you have enough
money, you can get it legally.</i>

1963
01:23:22,127 --> 01:23:25,878
<i>This is the annual convention
for the anti-aging medicine--</i>

1964
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:29,506
<i>Booth after booth of all the
taboo performance-enhancing drugs.</i>

1965
01:23:29,509 --> 01:23:32,761
<i>Stanozolol-- hey, that's
what Ben Johnson used.</i>

1966
01:23:32,761 --> 01:23:36,137
<i>Nandrolone-- isn't that what
Shawne Merriman got caught with?</i>

1967
01:23:36,139 --> 01:23:37,722
<i>Oh, and human
growth hormone--</i>

1968
01:23:37,724 --> 01:23:39,890
<i>They say Marion Jones
was taking that.</i>

1969
01:23:39,893 --> 01:23:42,019
Human growth hormone
usage

1970
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:44,145
has been rampant in baseball
and other sports.

1971
01:23:44,146 --> 01:23:46,314
<i>Athletes use
H.G.H. because it works</i>

1972
01:23:46,315 --> 01:23:49,024
<i>A lot like anabolic steroids.
And the best part is,</i>

1973
01:23:49,027 --> 01:23:52,235
<i>there's no way to test for
it. Here's how you get it.</i>

1974
01:23:52,237 --> 01:23:54,112
<i>First you go to your
anti-aging doctor.</i>

1975
01:23:54,113 --> 01:23:56,738
Now the doctor might
not be a medical doctor.

1976
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,242
Like in my case--
he's a chiropractor.

1977
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:01,493
And chiropractors
can't prescribe drugs,

1978
01:24:01,494 --> 01:24:03,871
but that's okay.
He just has another doctor

1979
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:05,789
write the prescriptions
for him.

1980
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:08,792
But be careful-- prescribing
hormones for anti-aging

1981
01:24:08,792 --> 01:24:12,671
is a felony. So you can't exactly
tell your anti-aging doctor

1982
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:14,671
that you're interested
in anti-aging.

1983
01:24:14,673 --> 01:24:17,007
Not to worry, though--
just use the words

1984
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,176
"hormone deficiency" instead.

1985
01:24:19,177 --> 01:24:21,302
<i>First thing, doc will want
to do a little physical.</i>

1986
01:24:21,304 --> 01:24:22,680
Aagh.

1987
01:24:24,307 --> 01:24:26,475
<i>Do you have people come to
you to try to get steroids?</i>

1988
01:24:26,475 --> 01:24:28,643
Absolutely.
But prescribing steroids--

1989
01:24:28,645 --> 01:24:31,145
That's not what we do,
not at all.

1990
01:24:31,146 --> 01:24:33,773
Mm-hmm. But it kind
of is what you do

1991
01:24:33,774 --> 01:24:35,690
in a way,
in a different way.

1992
01:24:35,693 --> 01:24:37,734
<i>Next you're
gonna get a urine test</i>

1993
01:24:37,735 --> 01:24:39,819
<i>to check your hormone
levels for 24 hours.</i>

1994
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:43,032
<i>That's a take-home test--
you know, scout's honor.</i>

1995
01:24:43,033 --> 01:24:46,743
<i>Send in the test and a week
later go get your results.</i>

1996
01:24:46,743 --> 01:24:48,869
<i>We got your
labs back here--</i>

1997
01:24:48,871 --> 01:24:51,204
Urinary growth hormone
output.

1998
01:24:51,206 --> 01:24:53,291
<i>But here's the
thing-- since the F.D.A.</i>

1999
01:24:53,292 --> 01:24:55,875
<i>has never defined what a
hormone deficiency really is,</i>

2000
01:24:55,877 --> 01:24:59,253
<i>Well, doc can pretty much interpret
the results however he wants.</i>

2001
01:24:59,255 --> 01:25:01,171
You're a little bit low,
coming down.

2002
01:25:01,173 --> 01:25:02,881
I'm gonna bring those
levels up to optimal.

2003
01:25:02,882 --> 01:25:05,051
<i>Now it may seem strange</i>

2004
01:25:05,051 --> 01:25:06,969
<i>that the most controversial
drugs in America</i>

2005
01:25:06,970 --> 01:25:08,804
<i>are being prescribed
using take-home tests,</i>

2006
01:25:08,805 --> 01:25:12,015
<i>and in my case by a doctor
I never met,</i>

2007
01:25:12,015 --> 01:25:14,475
<i>but hey, at least I'm not
the one breaking the law.</i>

2008
01:25:14,476 --> 01:25:16,269
<i>Why don't you
just get it legally?</i>

2009
01:25:16,270 --> 01:25:19,979
Um, I like getting it
the way I get it.

2010
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:21,858
It's cheap
and I can get it

2011
01:25:21,859 --> 01:25:24,109
anytime I want.

2012
01:25:24,110 --> 01:25:27,028
And I don't think there's
any real reason for me to--

2013
01:25:27,029 --> 01:25:28,822
I mean, I don't want
to go to a doctor.

2014
01:25:28,823 --> 01:25:30,282
That's a pain
in the ass.

2015
01:25:30,283 --> 01:25:32,115
<i>You ever worry
about getting arrested</i>

2016
01:25:32,118 --> 01:25:33,993
<i>or cops coming after you
or anything like that?</i>

2017
01:25:33,994 --> 01:25:35,953
<i>I'm not all that
concerned about it.</i>

2018
01:25:35,954 --> 01:25:38,456
You can justify
anything to yourself.

2019
01:25:38,457 --> 01:25:40,541
<i>And once you've
justified it to yourself</i>

2020
01:25:40,542 --> 01:25:44,293
<i>then you just think it's
cool. You think it's okay.</i>

2021
01:25:44,295 --> 01:25:46,253
So in my mind
it's okay.

2022
01:25:46,255 --> 01:25:48,672
I pose the question
to people, say,

2023
01:25:48,675 --> 01:25:53,219
"hey, if you had
to take a drug

2024
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:55,804
with the side effects--
known side effects

2025
01:25:55,805 --> 01:25:58,390
and the unknown effects
of the anabolic steroids

2026
01:25:58,390 --> 01:26:01,350
To keep your job
right now

2027
01:26:01,351 --> 01:26:04,688
and support your family,
would you do it?"

2028
01:26:04,689 --> 01:26:07,730
Maintaining an erection
is very easy to do

2029
01:26:07,733 --> 01:26:10,317
with the appropriate
chemical assistance.

2030
01:26:10,319 --> 01:26:13,695
Liquid Viagra
injected into the penis.

2031
01:26:13,697 --> 01:26:15,322
You inject this
in your penis?

2032
01:26:15,323 --> 01:26:16,782
Yep.

2033
01:26:16,783 --> 01:26:19,368
- Does it hurt?
- Um, not really.

2034
01:26:19,368 --> 01:26:21,159
<i>It's not just
athletes and porn stars</i>

2035
01:26:21,161 --> 01:26:22,869
<i>Taking
performance-enhancing drugs.</i>

2036
01:26:22,871 --> 01:26:24,912
<i>Just about everybody's
in on the action.</i>

2037
01:26:24,913 --> 01:26:27,748
Probably the most common thing
is what we call go-pills.

2038
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:29,376
There's probably
different kinds,

2039
01:26:29,377 --> 01:26:31,336
but dextramphetamine
is the big one.

2040
01:26:31,337 --> 01:26:33,588
<i>They work wonders, they really
do, especially if you've been</i>

2041
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:35,631
out there a long time and
it's hard to stay focused.

2042
01:26:35,632 --> 01:26:37,382
What about you?

2043
01:26:37,384 --> 01:26:40,051
Yeah, they'll spin you
right up.

2044
01:26:40,052 --> 01:26:42,470
Many parents may not be
aware that their children

2045
01:26:42,472 --> 01:26:45,140
are taking a drug
by the name of Adderall

2046
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:47,809
to improve their
academic performance.

2047
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:50,478
Adderall is
a powerful stimulant

2048
01:26:50,479 --> 01:26:53,023
very much like cocaine

2049
01:26:53,024 --> 01:26:54,605
or methamphetamine.

2050
01:26:54,606 --> 01:26:56,399
It's not just for people
who have problems.

2051
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,735
People who think completely
fine-- I've taken Adderall

2052
01:26:58,737 --> 01:27:00,779
in college here and there
to write a paper.

2053
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:02,529
And I said, "this is a
fun way to write a paper."

2054
01:27:02,532 --> 01:27:05,033
Your test scores go up
and you're

2055
01:27:05,033 --> 01:27:07,827
doing homework faster,
so you can do more work.

2056
01:27:07,828 --> 01:27:10,203
All I did when I went to class--
my friends, should I talk to them?

2057
01:27:10,206 --> 01:27:11,831
Nope, hold on. And I'd
be doing all my work.

2058
01:27:11,832 --> 01:27:13,623
<i>And for every performance</i>

2059
01:27:13,625 --> 01:27:16,042
<i>there's a way
to enhance it.</i>

2060
01:27:16,043 --> 01:27:17,711
<i>So you take beta-blockers
to calm you down?</i>

2061
01:27:17,712 --> 01:27:19,671
It actually doesn't
calm me down.

2062
01:27:19,671 --> 01:27:21,631
It prevents me
from getting nervous.

2063
01:27:21,631 --> 01:27:23,507
<i>- Here we go.
I was in college</i>

2064
01:27:23,509 --> 01:27:26,176
and I was having really really bad
problems with performance anxiety

2065
01:27:26,177 --> 01:27:29,136
and it was actually making me question
what I was doing in the first place.

2066
01:27:29,139 --> 01:27:32,181
A friend gave me beta-blockers
and I just couldn't believe it.

2067
01:27:32,182 --> 01:27:36,603
I felt like I could get up there
and do exactly what I wanted to do

2068
01:27:36,604 --> 01:27:40,396
and I wasn't hindered by
what my body was reacting to.

2069
01:27:42,942 --> 01:27:46,362
Blocking that adrenaline
goes a long way

2070
01:27:46,363 --> 01:27:48,779
towards enhancing
performance.

2071
01:27:48,782 --> 01:27:50,823
<i>So it's okay to
enhance your performance</i>

2072
01:27:50,824 --> 01:27:53,409
<i>if you're a pilot,
a porn star,</i>

2073
01:27:53,411 --> 01:27:55,536
<i>a musician
or a student,</i>

2074
01:27:55,537 --> 01:27:57,828
<i>but if your job is to play
professional baseball,</i>

2075
01:27:57,831 --> 01:27:59,664
<i>well, somehow that
makes you a cheater.</i>

2076
01:28:02,835 --> 01:28:05,127
<i>Do you feel it's cheating?</i>

2077
01:28:05,130 --> 01:28:07,631
Not at all.
Oh, no, certainly not.

2078
01:28:07,631 --> 01:28:09,798
<i>There is no
competition in music.</i>

2079
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,134
You know, this is
completely unlike sports.

2080
01:28:12,135 --> 01:28:14,301
<i>What about
in an audition situation?</i>

2081
01:28:14,304 --> 01:28:16,637
- Is there competition there?
- Yeah, there is.

2082
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:20,975
And, you know, a lot
of people take 'em

2083
01:28:20,976 --> 01:28:23,353
and I don't see that
there's a problem with it.

2084
01:28:23,354 --> 01:28:26,145
Was there any sort of moral
bridge to cross when you did it?

2085
01:28:26,146 --> 01:28:27,439
Well, we're
in the porn business.

2086
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,358
There's not a whole lot
of morals to begin with.

2087
01:28:29,359 --> 01:28:32,277
<i>Amphetamines in baseball--
they actually take the same pill</i>

2088
01:28:32,278 --> 01:28:34,029
- As a go-pill.
- Yeah, I've heard that.

2089
01:28:34,029 --> 01:28:36,323
In the clubhouse
they're called greenies.

2090
01:28:36,323 --> 01:28:38,323
And some in the game say
they could be

2091
01:28:38,324 --> 01:28:40,033
more common
than steroids.

2092
01:28:40,034 --> 01:28:42,036
In sports
you should play fair.

2093
01:28:42,037 --> 01:28:45,829
In war you shouldn't
play fair at all.

2094
01:28:45,832 --> 01:28:47,916
<i>I've got some men on a road</i>

2095
01:28:47,917 --> 01:28:50,667
<i>And it looks like a piece
of artillery firing at us.</i>

2096
01:28:50,670 --> 01:28:52,921
<i>I am rolling in
in self-defense.</i>

2097
01:28:52,921 --> 01:28:54,381
<i>Shaq!</i>

2098
01:28:54,381 --> 01:28:57,090
<i>In 2002 over Afghanistan</i>

2099
01:28:57,091 --> 01:28:59,551
<i>two American pilots
on go-pills</i>

2100
01:28:59,552 --> 01:29:01,679
<i>bombed a group
of friendly Canadians.</i>

2101
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:03,262
<i>I hope that
was the right thing to do.</i>

2102
01:29:03,265 --> 01:29:04,805
ME too.

2103
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:07,725
<i>Four Canadian
soldiers were killed.</i>

2104
01:29:07,726 --> 01:29:10,603
<i>Doctors say the pilots'
snap judgment to open fire</i>

2105
01:29:10,604 --> 01:29:13,064
<i>Is typical of someone
on speed.</i>

2106
01:29:13,064 --> 01:29:15,231
<i>The pilots were
charged with manslaughter,</i>

2107
01:29:15,233 --> 01:29:16,817
<i>But they blamed
their go-pills</i>

2108
01:29:16,818 --> 01:29:18,819
<i>and the charges
were dropped.</i>

2109
01:29:18,819 --> 01:29:20,610
<i>No other country
in the world</i>

2110
01:29:20,613 --> 01:29:22,738
<i>allows amphetamines
in their Air Force,</i>

2111
01:29:22,739 --> 01:29:24,740
<i>But in America
we require it.</i>

2112
01:29:28,037 --> 01:29:30,912
<i>You know, America
is a very competitive place</i>

2113
01:29:30,913 --> 01:29:33,372
and people will take advantage
of really anything they can

2114
01:29:33,373 --> 01:29:35,375
in order to help
themselves in that struggle.

2115
01:29:35,376 --> 01:29:37,377
I hate to say it, the
amount of beta-blockers

2116
01:29:37,377 --> 01:29:39,712
that they've got me on right
now-- California traffic

2117
01:29:39,712 --> 01:29:42,213
- doesn't bother me anymore.
- Really?

2118
01:29:42,215 --> 01:29:43,923
<i>It's too easy
to get it from a doctor.</i>

2119
01:29:43,925 --> 01:29:45,634
You say, "I can't
focus in class"

2120
01:29:45,635 --> 01:29:47,636
And the doctor prescribes
it automatically.

2121
01:29:47,636 --> 01:29:50,054
<i>And when you got Adderall
you just went to the doctor?</i>

2122
01:29:50,055 --> 01:29:53,099
No, it's just
passed around at school.

2123
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:55,059
<i>- It's passed around at school?
- Passed around at school.</i>

2124
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:56,976
You turn on your T.V.

2125
01:29:56,979 --> 01:29:59,520
And we push drugs, right?

2126
01:29:59,521 --> 01:30:01,606
If you have a headache--
use this.

2127
01:30:01,608 --> 01:30:04,149
If you have a pain in
your side-- use that.

2128
01:30:04,152 --> 01:30:06,360
<i>If you want to go
to sleep-- use this.</i>

2129
01:30:06,363 --> 01:30:07,863
If you want to wake up--
use that.

2130
01:30:07,863 --> 01:30:10,322
We are the only
country in the world

2131
01:30:10,323 --> 01:30:13,658
that permits
drugs of that kind

2132
01:30:13,661 --> 01:30:16,619
to be advertised
directly to the consumer.

2133
01:30:16,622 --> 01:30:18,872
<i>The American
pharmaceutical industry</i>

2134
01:30:18,873 --> 01:30:21,291
<i>spends almost $5 billion
a year on advertising.</i>

2135
01:30:21,292 --> 01:30:25,668
<i>And we in turn spend $250
billion on their drugs.</i>

2136
01:30:25,671 --> 01:30:28,296
<i>That's more than
any other country by far.</i>

2137
01:30:28,297 --> 01:30:30,925
<i>Are we the most unhealthy
people in the world</i>

2138
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:32,426
<i>Or do we just watch
too much T.V.?</i>

2139
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:37,430
Everybody's on a drug. So
why because I'm on a drug

2140
01:30:37,431 --> 01:30:39,474
does everybody have to
point a finger at me?

2141
01:30:39,475 --> 01:30:41,684
<i>- Why am I the bad guy?
- 'Cause you're on steroids.</i>

2142
01:30:41,685 --> 01:30:46,313
And steroids are bad.

2143
01:30:48,649 --> 01:30:50,567
To help children
make right choices

2144
01:30:50,568 --> 01:30:53,360
they need
good examples.

2145
01:30:53,363 --> 01:30:57,864
Athletics play such an
important role in our society,

2146
01:30:57,865 --> 01:31:00,493
but unfortunately,
some in professional sports

2147
01:31:00,493 --> 01:31:02,618
are not setting
much of an example.

2148
01:31:02,619 --> 01:31:05,079
<i>Long before George
Bush was the President</i>

2149
01:31:05,081 --> 01:31:08,125
<i>he was the owner of the Texas
Rangers, a major league baseball team</i>

2150
01:31:08,126 --> 01:31:11,418
<i>With none other than Jose
Canseco on the roster.</i>

2151
01:31:11,421 --> 01:31:14,462
<i>Do you
think that the team trainers,</i>

2152
01:31:14,463 --> 01:31:17,716
The managers, the general
managers and even the owners

2153
01:31:17,716 --> 01:31:19,842
might have been aware

2154
01:31:19,845 --> 01:31:22,136
that some players
were using steroids?

2155
01:31:22,137 --> 01:31:25,556
No doubt in my mind.
Absolutely.

2156
01:31:25,557 --> 01:31:27,515
<i>So did the President know</i>

2157
01:31:27,518 --> 01:31:29,894
<i>that his players were
on the juice?</i>

2158
01:31:29,895 --> 01:31:32,186
You've admitted to using
steroids in the past.

2159
01:31:32,188 --> 01:31:34,856
Knowing what you know now
about them,

2160
01:31:34,858 --> 01:31:37,440
<i>- would you have done it?
- Yeah, absolutely.</i>

2161
01:31:37,443 --> 01:31:39,278
The National Football League
has talked more

2162
01:31:39,279 --> 01:31:41,237
about steroid testing
or human growth hormone.

2163
01:31:41,238 --> 01:31:42,654
And I know
back in your day

2164
01:31:42,655 --> 01:31:44,363
you've admitted
that you did that.

2165
01:31:44,365 --> 01:31:46,408
Your stand
on that right now?

2166
01:31:46,408 --> 01:31:49,368
I think it's good
to do doping tests

2167
01:31:49,369 --> 01:31:51,371
and the trick obviously
to find a way

2168
01:31:51,372 --> 01:31:52,913
of really doing
true testing.

2169
01:31:52,914 --> 01:31:55,625
I think that
we have to do something

2170
01:31:55,626 --> 01:31:57,792
about the drug use
in sports.

2171
01:31:57,793 --> 01:32:02,172
And I think it does send the
wrong message to our children.

2172
01:32:02,173 --> 01:32:05,257
<i>So Arnold wants
to crack down on steroids,</i>

2173
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:07,676
<i>but every year he sponsors
his own bodybuilding show,</i>

2174
01:32:07,677 --> 01:32:09,429
<i>The Arnold Classic.</i>

2175
01:32:09,430 --> 01:32:10,930
And they don't drug-test
at all.

2176
01:32:10,931 --> 01:32:13,099
Isn't it unbelievable, the
shape these guys are in,

2177
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:14,891
I mean, how ripped they
are, how bid they are,

2178
01:32:14,894 --> 01:32:17,728
how cut they are, their
posing routine and everything?

2179
01:32:17,729 --> 01:32:20,146
I'm so proud of them. I tell
you, it is really amazing.

2180
01:32:20,148 --> 01:32:22,023
<i>This year
Governor Schwarzenegger</i>

2181
01:32:22,024 --> 01:32:24,443
<i>handed over the winning
trophy to Victor Martinez,</i>

2182
01:32:24,444 --> 01:32:26,652
<i>a guy who was busted
for selling steroids</i>

2183
01:32:26,654 --> 01:32:28,237
<i>just a couple
of years ago.</i>

2184
01:32:28,238 --> 01:32:30,238
<i>And a few days
before this competition</i>

2185
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:33,492
<i>he was implicated
in another steroid scandal.</i>

2186
01:32:33,493 --> 01:32:35,409
The bodybuilder
who won a competition

2187
01:32:35,411 --> 01:32:37,996
sponsored by Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger this past weekend

2188
01:32:37,997 --> 01:32:40,081
has been linked to a
steroid investigation.

2189
01:32:40,082 --> 01:32:42,626
<i>A spokesman for the Governor
says Schwarzenegger did not know</i>

2190
01:32:42,627 --> 01:32:44,877
<i>of Martinez's links
to steroids.</i>

2191
01:32:44,877 --> 01:32:47,755
<i>Come on, Arnold, what
do you mean you didn't know?</i>

2192
01:32:47,756 --> 01:32:49,631
<i>Okay, let's compare.</i>

2193
01:32:49,631 --> 01:32:52,341
<i>Here's Arnold Schwarzenegger
when he was on steroids--</i>

2194
01:32:52,342 --> 01:32:56,220
<i>6'2", 235 lbs.</i>

2195
01:32:56,221 --> 01:32:58,305
<i>And here's
Victor Martinez,</i>

2196
01:32:58,305 --> 01:33:01,516
<i>seven inches shorter
and 15 lbs heavier.</i>

2197
01:33:01,519 --> 01:33:03,895
Give him a big hand,
come on, a big hand.

2198
01:33:03,895 --> 01:33:05,811
<i>You know, I've been
calling Arnold's office</i>

2199
01:33:05,813 --> 01:33:07,523
<i>For over a year
to get an interview,</i>

2200
01:33:07,524 --> 01:33:09,608
<i>but his people
keep telling me</i>

2201
01:33:09,609 --> 01:33:11,900
<i>that his position on
steroids is very clear.</i>

2202
01:33:11,902 --> 01:33:13,735
<i>So the only way
to get an answer</i>

2203
01:33:13,737 --> 01:33:15,570
<i>was to track him down
myself</i>

2204
01:33:15,572 --> 01:33:17,448
<i>at a place I knew
he would show up--</i>

2205
01:33:17,448 --> 01:33:19,408
<i>Muscle Beach.</i>

2206
01:33:19,408 --> 01:33:22,452
<i>It was just a few weeks before
the Governor's reelection</i>

2207
01:33:22,453 --> 01:33:25,412
<i>And Arnold went to where he
knew he could depend on support</i>

2208
01:33:25,414 --> 01:33:27,413
<i>to cement
his voting base.</i>

2209
01:33:27,416 --> 01:33:30,502
<i>This was my big chance.
I waited for hours.</i>

2210
01:33:30,502 --> 01:33:32,961
<i>And finally
there he was.</i>

2211
01:33:32,962 --> 01:33:35,005
<i>And there was
this other guy,</i>

2212
01:33:35,006 --> 01:33:37,631
<i>the tall guy, the one
in the middle. He saw me.</i>

2213
01:33:37,632 --> 01:33:40,259
<i>This is how politics
work these days.</i>

2214
01:33:40,261 --> 01:33:43,054
<i>The important thing when making
an appearance is the photo op.</i>

2215
01:33:43,055 --> 01:33:45,139
<i>The tall guy's gonna
nod at me.</i>

2216
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:47,225
<i>Then he's gonna point
Arnold in my direction.</i>

2217
01:33:47,225 --> 01:33:50,935
<i>Arnold, his instincts honed
by years of being a huge star,</i>

2218
01:33:50,936 --> 01:33:53,814
<i>instantly sizes up
the situation,</i>

2219
01:33:53,814 --> 01:33:55,689
<i>notices
the various cameras</i>

2220
01:33:55,690 --> 01:33:58,400
<i>and decides to use me to
further his reelection bid.</i>

2221
01:33:58,402 --> 01:34:02,029
<i>Look at those arms.
Look at those arms.</i>

2222
01:34:02,030 --> 01:34:04,448
<i>And instead of
talking about steroids</i>

2223
01:34:04,448 --> 01:34:06,198
<i>and the cheating
culture of America,</i>

2224
01:34:06,199 --> 01:34:08,201
<i>he compliments me
on my biceps</i>

2225
01:34:08,202 --> 01:34:10,161
<i>and we end up on the
cover of the L.A. "Times."</i>

2226
01:34:10,162 --> 01:34:12,079
There he is.
Oh my God.

2227
01:34:12,081 --> 01:34:13,832
<i>Not that I mind.</i>

2228
01:34:13,832 --> 01:34:15,957
<i>After all, it was kind
of like a dream come true.</i>

2229
01:34:15,958 --> 01:34:18,335
Son of a bitch.

2230
01:34:18,336 --> 01:34:22,131
<i>But I still have all
these unanswered questions.</i>

2231
01:34:22,131 --> 01:34:23,922
<i>Let me tell
you this, first of all--</i>

2232
01:34:23,925 --> 01:34:27,426
You can't knock Arnold
really, okay?

2233
01:34:27,427 --> 01:34:30,555
Because the steroids didn't get
him into that office that he's in.

2234
01:34:30,555 --> 01:34:32,430
But he basically comes out
and he says,

2235
01:34:32,431 --> 01:34:35,141
"if you work hard
and you play by the rules

2236
01:34:35,143 --> 01:34:37,269
this country is truly
open to you.

2237
01:34:37,270 --> 01:34:39,688
You can achieve anything."
but did he get to where he is

2238
01:34:39,689 --> 01:34:42,814
playing by the rules? Or would
he have ever even been famous

2239
01:34:42,815 --> 01:34:44,650
had he not taken
those drugs?

2240
01:34:44,652 --> 01:34:46,527
<i>Well, let's look at it
this way--</i>

2241
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:48,654
<i>Let's talk
about other heroes.</i>

2242
01:34:48,655 --> 01:34:51,989
<i>Let's talk about John Kennedy.
He was a hero in the Navy.</i>

2243
01:34:51,990 --> 01:34:55,243
John Kennedy served as the
President of the United States.

2244
01:34:55,244 --> 01:34:58,872
<i>But John Kennedy cheated on his
wife right in the White House</i>

2245
01:34:58,872 --> 01:35:02,167
with Marilyn Monroe and who
knows how many others, okay?

2246
01:35:02,167 --> 01:35:04,460
It's no different
than biblical characters.

2247
01:35:04,461 --> 01:35:07,712
Moses was a hero
but Moses was a heel.

2248
01:35:07,712 --> 01:35:09,506
He didn't get
into the Promised Land.

2249
01:35:09,506 --> 01:35:11,591
He didn't do
what God told him to do.

2250
01:35:11,591 --> 01:35:15,302
David was a hero--
King David was a hero,

2251
01:35:15,304 --> 01:35:17,971
But David was a heel.
He chased every woman

2252
01:35:17,974 --> 01:35:19,931
in a skirt,
or in a toga,

2253
01:35:19,932 --> 01:35:21,432
or whatever they wore
back then.

2254
01:35:21,434 --> 01:35:23,976
Every man is fallible

2255
01:35:23,978 --> 01:35:26,104
and even the people

2256
01:35:26,104 --> 01:35:28,314
who were
the prime examples

2257
01:35:28,314 --> 01:35:30,315
of how to run your life
in the bible

2258
01:35:30,317 --> 01:35:33,152
screwed up.
They all screwed up.

2259
01:35:33,153 --> 01:35:35,613
So people need
to get off their

2260
01:35:35,613 --> 01:35:38,698
self-righteous
soapboxes

2261
01:35:38,699 --> 01:35:40,533
and start loving
each other.

2262
01:35:40,534 --> 01:35:42,911
We just need to go out
there and do our jobs,

2263
01:35:42,912 --> 01:35:46,329
just as you professionals
do your job.

2264
01:35:46,332 --> 01:35:48,873
All of you guys lied.

2265
01:35:48,875 --> 01:35:50,876
All of y'all

2266
01:35:50,877 --> 01:35:53,003
in a story or whatever
have lied.

2267
01:35:53,005 --> 01:35:55,796
<i>Should you have an asterisk
behind your name?</i>

2268
01:35:55,797 --> 01:35:57,798
All of you have lied.

2269
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:59,800
All of you have said
something wrong.

2270
01:35:59,801 --> 01:36:02,720
All of you have dirt,
all of you.

2271
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:04,721
When your
closet's clean

2272
01:36:04,722 --> 01:36:06,722
then come clean
somebody else's.

2273
01:36:06,725 --> 01:36:09,100
But clean yours first.

2274
01:36:09,101 --> 01:36:11,144
<i>Hi. How are you?</i>

2275
01:36:11,145 --> 01:36:12,688
The last name is Bell,
B-E-L-L.

2276
01:36:15,315 --> 01:36:17,899
<i>I took
the oath to serve you.</i>

2277
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:22,319
<i>I say to everyone here today
and to all Californians,</i>

2278
01:36:22,322 --> 01:36:24,614
I will not forget
my oath

2279
01:36:24,615 --> 01:36:26,490
And I will not
forget you.

2280
01:36:31,412 --> 01:36:34,082
<i>A few months
after I voted for Arnold</i>

2281
01:36:34,082 --> 01:36:36,125
<i>his people told
Gold's Gym</i>

2282
01:36:36,126 --> 01:36:37,710
<i>to remove
all of his images.</i>

2283
01:36:47,136 --> 01:36:49,720
What is the meaning
of this?

2284
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:52,305
<i>It's a dark day
in Gold's Gym.</i>

2285
01:36:52,306 --> 01:36:54,641
<i>They're taking down
Arnold's poster.</i>

2286
01:36:54,643 --> 01:36:56,893
Do you have a lot of respect for
Arnold? Is he one of your heroes?

2287
01:36:56,894 --> 01:36:59,436
Well, he was until
he took his shit down.

2288
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:00,939
You know, that guy's
a traitor, man.

2289
01:37:06,319 --> 01:37:08,529
<i>The gym feels different now.</i>

2290
01:37:08,529 --> 01:37:10,529
<i>The old Arnold's gone</i>

2291
01:37:10,530 --> 01:37:12,532
<i>and somehow this time</i>

2292
01:37:12,533 --> 01:37:14,283
<i>I don't think
he'll be back.</i>

2293
01:37:17,828 --> 01:37:20,581
So you're excited to be out
here instead of in Poughkeepsie?

2294
01:37:20,582 --> 01:37:22,373
Hell yeah, man.
I got a job making

2295
01:37:22,375 --> 01:37:24,167
three times as much money and
my rent's just about the same

2296
01:37:24,168 --> 01:37:25,877
and I'm right by the beach
and I got a convertible.

2297
01:37:25,877 --> 01:37:28,587
Right here next to
the mirror, honey.

2298
01:37:28,588 --> 01:37:29,880
Put a little
muscle in it.

2299
01:37:29,881 --> 01:37:32,716
Here you go.
- Higher.

2300
01:37:32,717 --> 01:37:35,386
So what do you plan on doing here
that you weren't doing in Poughkeepsie?

2301
01:37:35,386 --> 01:37:37,720
Jeez, like having fun with
life instead of hating life.

2302
01:37:37,721 --> 01:37:40,890
Think it'll help you with
your problems and stuff?

2303
01:37:40,891 --> 01:37:42,768
Absolutely.
I feel better already.

2304
01:37:42,769 --> 01:37:44,769
<i>Now that Mad
Dog's in California,</i>

2305
01:37:44,770 --> 01:37:47,688
<i>Things seem to be going
pretty good for him.</i>

2306
01:37:47,689 --> 01:37:50,483
<i>He got a job working as a trainer
at a local wrestling school.</i>

2307
01:37:50,484 --> 01:37:52,484
Got you! Now if I
want to take it here--

2308
01:37:52,484 --> 01:37:54,235
Keep your face up,
keep your face up.

2309
01:37:54,238 --> 01:37:56,654
<i>He'd actually
make a great teacher,</i>

2310
01:37:56,655 --> 01:37:58,573
<i>but that's not good
enough for Mad Dog.</i>

2311
01:37:58,574 --> 01:38:01,033
<i>He still wants
to be a superstar.</i>

2312
01:38:01,034 --> 01:38:04,244
<i>So this Sunday night, pay
per view, Madison Square Garden!</i>

2313
01:38:04,247 --> 01:38:07,081
Hell's Henrys will toll
for you.

2314
01:38:09,667 --> 01:38:13,377
Just not--
I'm sick, though, dude.

2315
01:38:13,378 --> 01:38:15,921
<i>Mad Dog sent
his promo to the W.W.E.,</i>

2316
01:38:15,922 --> 01:38:18,632
<i>but they rejected him
again.</i>

2317
01:38:18,634 --> 01:38:20,760
<i>They said
he's too old</i>

2318
01:38:20,761 --> 01:38:22,845
<i>and not what they're
looking for right now.</i>

2319
01:38:22,845 --> 01:38:25,305
<i>You know, I want to
believe that the world is good,</i>

2320
01:38:25,306 --> 01:38:28,475
<i>but it's not.
And I want to try hard,</i>

2321
01:38:28,475 --> 01:38:30,100
but why try
when you can't win?

2322
01:38:30,103 --> 01:38:32,185
Those who can't do,
train.

2323
01:38:32,186 --> 01:38:34,896
It's just I never
understood why I didn't,

2324
01:38:34,898 --> 01:38:36,815
you know?

2325
01:38:36,817 --> 01:38:39,652
<i>What's the problem with
just being a normal guy?</i>

2326
01:38:39,653 --> 01:38:41,319
<i>What's wrong with
just being normal?</i>

2327
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:43,445
There's nothing wrong
with it.

2328
01:38:43,447 --> 01:38:45,448
Well, actually, there is
something wrong with it.

2329
01:38:45,449 --> 01:38:47,242
the thing that's
wrong with it is

2330
01:38:47,243 --> 01:38:49,327
that I was born to attain
greatness and I'm the only one

2331
01:38:49,328 --> 01:38:52,453
that's holding myself back. And I need
to attain greatness. I need to do it.

2332
01:38:52,454 --> 01:38:54,914
<i>You live down by the beach,
you have a beautiful wife,</i>

2333
01:38:54,916 --> 01:38:56,582
<i>and nothing's ever
good enough.</i>

2334
01:38:56,585 --> 01:38:59,252
I can only imagine
how she feels.

2335
01:38:59,252 --> 01:39:02,212
And do you ever think,

2336
01:39:02,213 --> 01:39:05,298
"why am I dragging
somebody else in this?"

2337
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:08,717
I know that a lot of times
she's crying herself to sleep.

2338
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:12,514
And I know that
sometimes she doesn't glow

2339
01:39:12,515 --> 01:39:14,849
the way that she did
when I first met her.

2340
01:39:14,850 --> 01:39:17,269
And I know
it's my fault.

2341
01:39:17,270 --> 01:39:19,103
And it really
tears me up.

2342
01:39:19,104 --> 01:39:20,770
<i>Yeah.
Well, I mean,</i>

2343
01:39:20,771 --> 01:39:22,814
<i>I worry every day
that--</i>

2344
01:39:22,815 --> 01:39:25,067
What I worry about is
you're gonna lose your job,

2345
01:39:25,068 --> 01:39:28,069
<i>You're gonna lose your wife and
then you're gonna lose yourself.</i>

2346
01:39:28,070 --> 01:39:30,029
If I lose my job and my
wife, what else do I have?

2347
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:35,118
<i>I just feel</i>

2348
01:39:35,118 --> 01:39:37,619
<i>that I have more
to offer this world.</i>

2349
01:39:37,621 --> 01:39:40,663
<i>And I don't know
exactly what it is</i>

2350
01:39:40,664 --> 01:39:43,000
<i>or how I'm gonna
go about doing it.</i>

2351
01:39:42,716 --> 01:39:45,341
I know there's
something in here

2352
01:39:45,342 --> 01:39:48,092
That's meant for the
rest of the world to know.

2353
01:39:53,056 --> 01:39:56,432
When you were kids

2354
01:39:56,434 --> 01:39:58,559
you all admired

2355
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,935
the champion marble shooter,
the fastest runner,

2356
01:40:00,936 --> 01:40:05,063
big league ballplayers,
the toughest boxers.

2357
01:40:05,064 --> 01:40:07,856
Americans love a winner

2358
01:40:07,859 --> 01:40:09,900
and will not tolerate
a loser.

2359
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:21,199
<i>Smelly is now competing</i>

2360
01:40:21,201 --> 01:40:23,327
<i>against the best guys
in the world</i>

2361
01:40:23,328 --> 01:40:25,494
<i>and he hopes to achieve
his childhood dream</i>

2362
01:40:25,496 --> 01:40:27,372
<i>of bench-pressing
700 lbs.</i>

2363
01:40:27,372 --> 01:40:29,831
<i>But he and his wife
agreed</i>

2364
01:40:29,832 --> 01:40:33,417
<i>that this would be his
last meet on steroids.</i>

2365
01:40:33,418 --> 01:40:36,168
I knew that she didn't
really care for it,

2366
01:40:36,170 --> 01:40:38,253
but i didn't know
it hurt her that much.

2367
01:40:38,255 --> 01:40:41,131
And I didn't know she
worried that much about it.

2368
01:40:41,132 --> 01:40:43,507
<i>It's definitely something
that's not gonna be easy to do.</i>

2369
01:40:43,509 --> 01:40:45,801
<i>I don't necessarily want
to do it, but, you know,</i>

2370
01:40:45,802 --> 01:40:47,676
if I just stay on it
and ignore her,

2371
01:40:47,677 --> 01:40:49,261
that's just
being selfish.

2372
01:40:49,262 --> 01:40:51,512
He's trying to have
another kid, so he decided

2373
01:40:51,515 --> 01:40:53,515
that this is gonna be
his last meet

2374
01:40:53,516 --> 01:40:55,640
that he ever
takes anything.

2375
01:40:55,641 --> 01:40:58,600
How do you think that'll
affect his lifting?

2376
01:40:58,603 --> 01:41:00,686
It'll affect it somewhat,

2377
01:41:00,688 --> 01:41:03,314
but once he tapers off
and has the child

2378
01:41:03,314 --> 01:41:05,148
<i>he can go
right back on them.</i>

2379
01:41:05,149 --> 01:41:07,399
But he doesn't want to go back
on them. His wife doesn't want him

2380
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:09,150
to be on it at all
ever again.

2381
01:41:12,487 --> 01:41:14,488
The death of Smelly.

2382
01:41:14,488 --> 01:41:16,489
You think so?

2383
01:41:16,490 --> 01:41:18,240
Smelly will go back on.

2384
01:41:18,242 --> 01:41:20,701
<i>So you'll never
take it again?</i>

2385
01:41:20,702 --> 01:41:22,493
<i>- I'll never take 'em again?
- Yeah.</i>

2386
01:41:22,493 --> 01:41:24,203
No, I probably will
take 'em again

2387
01:41:24,203 --> 01:41:26,662
<i>- because this is something--
- How?</i>

2388
01:41:26,663 --> 01:41:28,914
Well, I'll figure out
a way.

2389
01:41:28,916 --> 01:41:31,417
I mean, that's something I'll
have to talk out with Andee,

2390
01:41:31,417 --> 01:41:33,251
but this is something
I've been--

2391
01:41:33,252 --> 01:41:35,793
I've been involved in power
lifting since I was 12 years old.

2392
01:41:35,795 --> 01:41:37,712
This is part of
what I like to do.

2393
01:41:37,713 --> 01:41:40,256
And I'm not gonna go

2394
01:41:40,257 --> 01:41:42,506
from squatting 800 lbs
to squatting 700 lbs.

2395
01:41:42,509 --> 01:41:44,842
<i>I'm gonna want to get
back on 'em for sure.</i>

2396
01:41:44,844 --> 01:41:47,177
<i>Which is kind of sad
'cause--</i>

2397
01:41:47,180 --> 01:41:49,304
Well, you know, a lot of
people have to lie to get ahead.

2398
01:41:49,305 --> 01:41:52,722
That's just kind of
the way things work.

2399
01:41:52,724 --> 01:41:55,475
Well, we weren't
brought up as cheaters.

2400
01:41:57,686 --> 01:41:59,853
Well, I mean,
people aren't brought up

2401
01:41:59,854 --> 01:42:02,648
to rob a bank either. You're
not really trained to rob a bank

2402
01:42:02,649 --> 01:42:05,106
or you're not really
trained to do drugs

2403
01:42:05,108 --> 01:42:07,149
or taught to do drugs
or anything like that,

2404
01:42:07,150 --> 01:42:08,818
but just, you know, it's
kind of the way you end up.

2405
01:42:11,695 --> 01:42:13,195
Yeah!
Come on!

2406
01:42:13,197 --> 01:42:15,530
Let's go, mark!
Go mark!

2407
01:42:15,533 --> 01:42:17,574
Let's go, Mark. Come on!

2408
01:42:17,576 --> 01:42:19,743
- Come on!
- Go Mark!

2409
01:42:22,246 --> 01:42:24,496
Go Mark!
Let's go, Mark!

2410
01:42:24,497 --> 01:42:27,038
Come on,
you got this.

2411
01:42:27,041 --> 01:42:29,291
<i>Come on, you got it!
Let's go, come on!</i>

2412
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:38,296
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yes! Yes!

2413
01:42:44,677 --> 01:42:46,761
<i>My baby
brother is on steroids</i>

2414
01:42:46,762 --> 01:42:48,930
<i>and we all know it.</i>

2415
01:42:48,931 --> 01:42:51,890
But look at us. My dad looks
like he won the lottery.

2416
01:42:51,891 --> 01:42:55,100
And my mom's prayers
have been answered.

2417
01:42:55,101 --> 01:42:58,020
<i>I was raised to believe
that cheaters never prosper,</i>

2418
01:42:58,020 --> 01:43:01,314
<i>but in America it seems
like cheaters always prosper.</i>

2419
01:43:03,817 --> 01:43:07,900
The use of performance-enhancing
drugs like steroids

2420
01:43:07,902 --> 01:43:10,735
<i>is dangerous and it
sends the wrong message</i>

2421
01:43:10,738 --> 01:43:14,154
<i>that there are shortcuts
to accomplishment</i>

2422
01:43:14,157 --> 01:43:17,992
<i>And that performance is more
important than character.</i>

2423
01:43:17,993 --> 01:43:20,118
<i>There is a clash in America</i>

2424
01:43:20,119 --> 01:43:22,578
<i>Between doing the right
thing and being the best.</i>

2425
01:43:22,581 --> 01:43:24,997
Americans play to win
all the time

2426
01:43:24,998 --> 01:43:27,707
<i>because the very
thought of losing</i>

2427
01:43:27,708 --> 01:43:30,292
<i>is hateful
to Americans.</i>

2428
01:43:30,292 --> 01:43:33,920
It is out of here!

2429
01:43:33,921 --> 01:43:37,840
<i>756!</i>

2430
01:43:37,841 --> 01:43:39,965
<i>Bonds stands alone!</i>

2431
01:43:39,966 --> 01:43:41,926
<i>In a culture
where second place</i>

2432
01:43:41,926 --> 01:43:44,260
<i>Is the first loser,</i>

2433
01:43:44,261 --> 01:43:47,721
<i>the real heroes are the
ones who win at all costs.</i>

2434
01:43:47,722 --> 01:43:50,265
Everything I have--
my career,

2435
01:43:50,265 --> 01:43:52,641
my success,
my family--

2436
01:43:52,643 --> 01:43:54,475
