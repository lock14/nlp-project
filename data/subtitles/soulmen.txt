1
00:00:03,519 --> 00:00:05,421
Marcus Hooks
and the Real Deal, take 6.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,459
- That's three names.
- You want me to sing the main line?

3
00:00:07,526 --> 00:00:10,088
Oh, yeah, here we go, here we go.

4
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:12,601
(Narrator)
Tonight we take a musical journey south,

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,641
where the legendary soul band
Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal

6
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:17,644
developed their signature sound.

7
00:00:17,712 --> 00:00:19,112
(Man) 1, 2!

8
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:20,308
** (percussion)

9
00:00:20,384 --> 00:00:23,356
** (instrumental)

10
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,187
(Man)
* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh *

11
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:29,995
They started out singing for pennies
on the street corners of Memphis.

12
00:00:31,304 --> 00:00:32,704
* Pull the string *

13
00:00:32,773 --> 00:00:35,266
* And I'll wink at you *

14
00:00:35,345 --> 00:00:36,938
* I'm your puppet *

15
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,050
* Mm-hmm, yeah *

16
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:43,057
* I'll do funny things *

17
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,595
* If you want me to *

18
00:00:45,663 --> 00:00:47,394
* I'm your puppet *

19
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:53,441
* I'm yours *

20
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:57,245
* To have and to hold *

21
00:00:57,318 --> 00:00:58,877
* Darling, you've got *

22
00:00:58,954 --> 00:01:00,787
* Full control *

23
00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:02,622
* Of your puppet *

24
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:05,097
But by 1972,

25
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,657
Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal

26
00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:09,970
had become one
of the biggest R&B acts in the world.

27
00:01:10,042 --> 00:01:13,138
* Nothin' like sweet soul music *

28
00:01:13,214 --> 00:01:15,150
* To bring us together *

29
00:01:15,218 --> 00:01:17,814
They played to sellout houses
all over the world.

30
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:19,586
They'd sold 6 million records

31
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:22,323
and influenced a generation
of American musicians.

32
00:01:22,398 --> 00:01:25,233
* Dance to the sweet soul music *

33
00:01:25,302 --> 00:01:26,235
* Yahh *

34
00:01:26,304 --> 00:01:29,276
But that all ended on July 24, 1977,

35
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,313
when Marcus Hooks
began his solo career

36
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,352
with a dramatic concert
at New York's Madison Square Garden.

37
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,048
(Announcer)
Ladies and gentlemen,

38
00:01:36,122 --> 00:01:38,923
Marcus Hooks.

39
00:01:38,995 --> 00:01:40,987
(cheering and applause)

40
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,435
Marcus.

41
00:01:48,512 --> 00:01:49,537
* Ooh-ooh-ooh *

42
00:01:49,614 --> 00:01:51,811
Hey, boy, hi.

43
00:01:51,885 --> 00:01:53,319
Hey, boy, dance.

44
00:01:53,388 --> 00:01:54,481
Yeah.

45
00:01:54,557 --> 00:01:56,549
But while Hooks
became a music legend,

46
00:01:56,627 --> 00:01:59,359
the journey took
a decidedly different direction

47
00:01:59,432 --> 00:02:02,130
for former band mates
Floyd Henderson and Louis Hinds.

48
00:02:02,204 --> 00:02:03,729
** (disco)

49
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:06,003
Renowned for their
signature dance stylings

50
00:02:06,077 --> 00:02:08,776
from their one
breakout hit, "Walk in the Park,"

51
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,343
the duo broke up in 1979.

52
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:12,912
Citing creative differences

53
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,860
and a desire to pursue separate projects.

54
00:02:15,929 --> 00:02:16,861
(woman screams)

55
00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:18,023
Back off! Freeze!

56
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:19,363
Get your hands up! Let me see them!

57
00:02:19,436 --> 00:02:21,564
Oh. Wait. Wait, wait.
It ain't... Ohh!

58
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:24,440
The gun ain't real! Ow! It ain't real! Ow!

59
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:26,208
I'm just broke, God (bleep) it!

60
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:27,807
I ain't tryin' to hurt no (bleep)!

61
00:02:27,885 --> 00:02:29,353
Watch your (bleep) damn hands!

62
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,888
Police mother(bleep) brutality!

63
00:02:30,956 --> 00:02:32,322
(Narrator)
While Floyd Henderson...

64
00:02:34,296 --> 00:02:36,493
Come on down to Floyd's Car Wash,

65
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:38,628
where everything is done by hand.

66
00:02:38,704 --> 00:02:40,468
...combined his showmanship

67
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,738
with an entrepreneur spirit.

68
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:44,940
And don't forget about
Super Soul Sundays,

69
00:02:45,016 --> 00:02:47,111
with a full body wash

70
00:02:47,187 --> 00:02:49,248
to guarantee a free rimjob.

71
00:02:51,895 --> 00:02:53,990
Come on. Get your rimjob.

72
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:55,158
- (moans pleasurably)
- Come get your rimjob.

73
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:57,500
Come and get your rimjob!
(chuckles)

74
00:02:57,573 --> 00:03:00,601
Whatever happened
to the forgotten duo...

75
00:03:00,678 --> 00:03:02,078
The Real Deal?

76
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,619
Baby, turn the navigation on.

77
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:10,355
I hope we can find this place
sometime tonight.

78
00:03:10,429 --> 00:03:12,023
He gonna love it there.

79
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:14,125
They got Craftmatic adjustable beds,

80
00:03:14,202 --> 00:03:16,229
clap-on lamps.

81
00:03:16,306 --> 00:03:18,139
Y'all better shut up back there,
I'm tellin' you.

82
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,405
I'm gonna reach back there

83
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,949
and pop one of them little boys
upside the head so bad.

84
00:03:22,017 --> 00:03:23,417
(chatter)

85
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:25,183
I think that's it, Uncle Floyd.

86
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:28,021
Whoo!
(chuckles)

87
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:30,930
Now, I can't believe
I let you talk me into this bullshit.

88
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,995
What you talking about?
It's beautiful. You don't like this?

89
00:03:34,072 --> 00:03:35,165
It's a death camp.

90
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:37,575
Oh, how is it a death camp, Unc?

91
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:39,775
We got 36 holes of golf.

92
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,478
Three swimming pools.

93
00:03:41,552 --> 00:03:43,454
You know the ratio
of women to men here

94
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:46,119
is 5 to 1, Unc? 5 to 1.

95
00:03:46,194 --> 00:03:47,492
That mean you got 'em everywhere.

96
00:03:47,563 --> 00:03:48,826
You can't even move.
There's women...

97
00:03:48,899 --> 00:03:50,368
Every time you look around,

98
00:03:50,436 --> 00:03:52,496
women crawling between your legs,
arms, anything.

99
00:03:52,572 --> 00:03:55,408
I mean, damn, Unc.
And if you're worried about the business,

100
00:03:55,478 --> 00:03:56,503
I got that.

101
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,310
You taught me everything you know.

102
00:03:58,383 --> 00:03:59,977
Yeah.

103
00:04:00,054 --> 00:04:02,023
Yeah. You know something, son?

104
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,058
You're real crafty.

105
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,058
Appreciate that.

106
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:05,618
See, first you move into my house.

107
00:04:05,697 --> 00:04:07,394
Then you take over my business.

108
00:04:07,467 --> 00:04:08,992
- Aw, man, I ain't taking...
- Oh, yeah.

109
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,733
Then you move me
all the way out to the Valley, man,

110
00:04:10,807 --> 00:04:12,332
so can't nobody hear me scream. Right?

111
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:14,777
Actually, that's why
we're moving you here.

112
00:04:14,847 --> 00:04:16,840
So the nurses can hear your ass scream.

113
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,284
You remember you fell on that floor
for three days

114
00:04:18,354 --> 00:04:20,324
- and couldn't nobody hear you.
- I remember.

115
00:04:20,391 --> 00:04:24,728
Yeah. Now, stop being bitter, man.
Enjoy yourself, Unc.

116
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:27,565
There are your golden years, player.

117
00:04:27,637 --> 00:04:28,605
(sighs)

118
00:04:28,673 --> 00:04:30,266
Now, come on
in the house and say bye

119
00:04:30,342 --> 00:04:32,004
to Charlene and the kids.

120
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:34,539
Fuck them kids.

121
00:04:34,617 --> 00:04:36,643
Fuck the kids?

122
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,813
Yeah.

123
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:40,052
** (percussion)

124
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:53,276
(sigh)

125
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:11,877
(sighing)
Ohh...

126
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:12,942
(grunts)

127
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:22,033
- (Woman) Ohhh... yeah, baby.
- Ohh! Ohh!

128
00:05:22,103 --> 00:05:25,200
Ohh! Oh, give it to me.
Give it to me nice and hard.

129
00:05:25,276 --> 00:05:27,712
Oh, ipapi, sil Ooh!

130
00:05:27,781 --> 00:05:28,942
Oh, right there!

131
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:30,679
(trembling)
Ohhhhh!

132
00:05:30,753 --> 00:05:33,246
Uhh! Ohh!

133
00:05:33,325 --> 00:05:34,953
Ooh. Don't stop, baby.

134
00:05:35,027 --> 00:05:35,960
No.

135
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:37,190
No.

136
00:05:37,265 --> 00:05:38,699
No, you're not getting away.

137
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:40,030
(laughing)
Hoo hoo! Hoo hoo!

138
00:05:40,103 --> 00:05:41,036
Yummy!

139
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:42,972
- Uhh! Uhh! Yeah.
- (bed thumping)

140
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:46,378
(both screaming passionately)

141
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:47,439
Aah!

142
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,113
***

143
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:55,120
(loud snoring)

144
00:05:55,198 --> 00:05:56,997
(exhales audibly)

145
00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:00,030
Mmm...

146
00:06:04,415 --> 00:06:05,576
How's the hip?

147
00:06:06,753 --> 00:06:07,778
Fine.

148
00:06:07,855 --> 00:06:08,879
Okay.

149
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,759
(doctor sighs, rubber snaps)

150
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:16,870
(squishing)

151
00:06:16,938 --> 00:06:19,101
Okay, Mr. Henderson.
I'm gonna need you

152
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:21,771
to, uh, stands up, face the window,

153
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:23,543
and bend over the table.

154
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,415
My problem ain't back
in that area, doctor.

155
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:27,683
Look, Mr. Henderson,
your sleep problem

156
00:06:27,757 --> 00:06:30,227
can be a symptom of a myriad
of different conditions,

157
00:06:30,295 --> 00:06:31,524
some of which, you know, are...

158
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:33,795
well, you know, back in that area.

159
00:06:36,073 --> 00:06:37,302
- (sighs)
- (squishing)

160
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,345
I don't like nobody
behind me like that, Huds.

161
00:06:39,412 --> 00:06:41,177
I'm telling you, I just don't like
nobody playing

162
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:42,911
- with my penny.
- I'll be very gentle.

163
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,477
I'll be in and out before you know it.

164
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:49,589
Just bend over. There you go.

165
00:06:49,665 --> 00:06:52,295
Hold on, now. Get a good grip.

166
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,303
Ohh...

167
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:54,772
Just relax.

168
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:55,774
Relax.

169
00:06:55,843 --> 00:06:56,902
* Sittin' on *

170
00:06:56,978 --> 00:06:59,244
* The dock of the bay *

171
00:06:59,316 --> 00:07:00,248
* Watching the *

172
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:03,346
* Tiiiiiide *

173
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,518
* Roll away *

174
00:07:05,594 --> 00:07:06,823
* Ooh ooh *

175
00:07:07,831 --> 00:07:08,992
All right, again, Mr. Henderson,

176
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:10,899
there's absolutely
nothing wrong with you.

177
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,233
So take those for insomnia.

178
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,298
Give me a call if anything changes.
All right?

179
00:07:14,376 --> 00:07:15,902
- All right.
- Do me a favor.

180
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,644
Stop being so hard
on yourself, Mr. Henderson.

181
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:20,346
Retirement can be a tough transition.

182
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:21,411
All right?

183
00:07:31,642 --> 00:07:34,511
Okay. Oh, yeah. Hey, listen.

184
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,550
Don't mix those sleeping pills with alcohol

185
00:07:36,617 --> 00:07:38,610
unless you want to kill yourself.
(chuckles)

186
00:07:38,688 --> 00:07:41,284
(laughs)

187
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:42,918
Okay. Who's next?

188
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,261
(Weather woman)
And for those of you in the Southland,

189
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,601
tomorrow's gonna be
another beautiful day with

190
00:07:48,673 --> 00:07:50,232
bright, sunny skies

191
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:52,575
and temperatures into the mid-80s.

192
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:54,513
A perfect day for some golf.

193
00:07:54,584 --> 00:07:57,784
And that's gonna continue
right into next week.

194
00:07:57,857 --> 00:08:00,760
Gorgeous blue skies
and sensationally warm.

195
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:02,991
It doesn't get any better than that.

196
00:08:04,034 --> 00:08:05,161
This just in.

197
00:08:05,237 --> 00:08:06,967
Soul music fans around the globe

198
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,409
are mourning the loss
of Marcus Hooks.

199
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,312
The legendary singer and songwriter

200
00:08:12,383 --> 00:08:14,751
apparently suffered
a massive heart attack

201
00:08:14,821 --> 00:08:17,451
while performing last night
in front of a capacity crowd

202
00:08:17,526 --> 00:08:20,430
at Kungstrardgarden Park
in Stockholm, Sweden.

203
00:08:20,498 --> 00:08:23,025
His body's being
flown home to New York,

204
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,197
where a memorial service
will be held next week.

205
00:08:25,274 --> 00:08:27,608
The seven-time Grammy Award winner

206
00:08:27,678 --> 00:08:29,806
was 63 years old.

207
00:08:29,881 --> 00:08:32,546
* I'll do anything for you *

208
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,918
We're back in just a moment.

209
00:08:34,925 --> 00:08:36,655
- (telephone rings)
- Humh!

210
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:40,162
Kezian Motors. Can I help you?

211
00:08:41,503 --> 00:08:42,493
Who?

212
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:46,442
Hinds, telephone!

213
00:08:51,755 --> 00:08:53,189
Dealing drugs out of my garage?

214
00:08:53,258 --> 00:08:56,389
Listen, you doing something illegal,

215
00:08:56,464 --> 00:08:59,299
I'll find out and send your ass
back to prison

216
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:02,705
so fucking fast, it will make
your black monkey head spin.

217
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:07,911
You know, there was a time

218
00:09:07,985 --> 00:09:09,614
I would've knocked your teeth
down your throat

219
00:09:09,688 --> 00:09:11,088
for saying some shit like that to me.

220
00:09:11,157 --> 00:09:12,489
But I'm a changed man.

221
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,587
I'm trying to be
all centered and shit.

222
00:09:14,664 --> 00:09:17,658
Now, I could'a called you
a unibrow-shaving, pilaf-eating,

223
00:09:17,736 --> 00:09:19,535
greasy-ass goat fucker,
but I didn't, did I?

224
00:09:19,606 --> 00:09:21,803
- Uh-uh.
- 'Cause I didn't want to hurt your feelings,

225
00:09:21,877 --> 00:09:23,470
and I didn't want to piss you off,

226
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:25,778
just like I know
deep, deep down inside,

227
00:09:25,851 --> 00:09:27,787
you don't want to piss me off, either.

228
00:09:27,855 --> 00:09:28,788
- Now, do you?
- Uh-uh.

229
00:09:28,857 --> 00:09:30,223
Uh-uh. No. Uh-uh.

230
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:31,420
All right.

231
00:09:31,495 --> 00:09:33,191
Peace.

232
00:09:33,264 --> 00:09:34,254
(coughs)

233
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,528
(coughing)

234
00:09:35,602 --> 00:09:36,865
Scruffy, Kibbles...

235
00:09:36,938 --> 00:09:38,498
- (continues in foreign language)
- Yeah, this is Louis.

236
00:09:38,574 --> 00:09:40,372
Hey. Mr. Hinds.

237
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:42,744
It's Danny Epstein
calling from New York. How are you today?

238
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,113
Who?

239
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:45,117
Marty's son.

240
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:46,449
Oh, yeah?

241
00:09:46,523 --> 00:09:48,151
(laughs) Shit,

242
00:09:48,225 --> 00:09:50,023
I ain't seen you since you were in diapers.

243
00:09:50,095 --> 00:09:51,028
Yeah. Well,

244
00:09:51,097 --> 00:09:52,030
I assume you heard

245
00:09:52,099 --> 00:09:53,431
about Marcus' passing, yeah?

246
00:09:53,501 --> 00:09:56,940
Oh, yeah. I'm crying the tears
of a motherfucking clown.

247
00:09:57,008 --> 00:09:59,376
Okay. Here's the thing.
VH1 is putting together

248
00:09:59,446 --> 00:10:01,211
a farewell tribute at the Apollo,

249
00:10:01,283 --> 00:10:03,378
and they got a lot of big names lined up.

250
00:10:03,454 --> 00:10:05,446
And they want Henderson and Hinds
to perform, right?

251
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:07,993
That's right! The Real Deal
back together again.

252
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:09,360
It's a great opportunity.

253
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:10,956
You talk to Floyd?

254
00:10:11,034 --> 00:10:12,502
I did.

255
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,062
Mr. Henderson is in.

256
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,072
Good.

257
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:16,542
Then I'm out.

258
00:10:16,611 --> 00:10:17,670
(click)

259
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,890
* Born under a bad sign *

260
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:33,937
* Been down since I began to crawl *

261
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:38,114
* If it wasn't for bad luck *

262
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:41,383
* You know I wouldn't have
no luck at all *

263
00:10:46,131 --> 00:10:47,532
* Hard luck and trouble... *

264
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:48,830
(baby crying)

265
00:10:48,904 --> 00:10:51,066
(indistinct chatter, laughing)

266
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:06,167
(muttering)

267
00:11:11,912 --> 00:11:13,710
That is disgusting.

268
00:11:13,782 --> 00:11:15,217
Ooh!

269
00:11:17,122 --> 00:11:20,151
I don't believe this. Hmm.

270
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:21,594
Hey!

271
00:11:21,663 --> 00:11:22,653
Uhh!

272
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:25,567
(thud)

273
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,549
Ohh. Damn!

274
00:11:38,094 --> 00:11:39,960
Ooh. Fuck happened, man?

275
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,196
Hell if I know. I came in,
found your ass laying there.

276
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,433
Bullshit.
You looked me dead in my eyes.

277
00:11:45,507 --> 00:11:46,566
Man, you recognized me.

278
00:11:46,643 --> 00:11:48,168
I didn't recognize you.
You done changed.

279
00:11:49,314 --> 00:11:50,509
I come all the way down here,

280
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,017
and, man, you gonna
look me in my face

281
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,055
- and knock me the fuck out?
- Should've called first.

282
00:11:54,123 --> 00:11:55,182
How the hell I'm gonna call

283
00:11:55,258 --> 00:11:56,351
and you ain't got no phone?

284
00:11:56,427 --> 00:11:58,397
What kind of person
ain't got no land phone?

285
00:11:58,464 --> 00:12:00,262
Kind of person don't want to get no calls.

286
00:12:00,334 --> 00:12:01,826
You don't even know
why I came down

287
00:12:01,904 --> 00:12:04,170
to this old fucked-up-the-ass
neighborhood.

288
00:12:04,242 --> 00:12:06,735
I talked to little Ep.
I know why you're here.

289
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:09,181
And the answer is no.

290
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:12,245
Did he tell you we're at the Apollo
and they sold out?

291
00:12:12,323 --> 00:12:14,259
Did he also tell you
who gonna be there?

292
00:12:14,327 --> 00:12:17,356
Booker T. Jones. Isaac Hayes.
Bootsy Collins.

293
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:18,365
Shakira.

294
00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:19,424
I don't care.

295
00:12:19,502 --> 00:12:21,131
Do it for Marcus.

296
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:22,469
Fuck Marcus.

297
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:23,771
Well, do it for me.

298
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,746
- Fuck you!
- Come on, man.

299
00:12:25,815 --> 00:12:27,408
- This is our shot.
- At what?

300
00:12:27,484 --> 00:12:29,977
At a comeback, fool.
If we do this shit right,

301
00:12:30,055 --> 00:12:32,287
we can get a record deal
and get back on the road

302
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,885
like we was 30 years ago.

303
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:35,693
I ain't trying to be like 30 years ago!

304
00:12:35,766 --> 00:12:37,234
I ain't trying to make no comeback.

305
00:12:37,302 --> 00:12:39,499
I'm gone, and I want to stay gone.

306
00:12:40,675 --> 00:12:42,542
Don't make me beg you, man.

307
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:44,012
(sigh)

308
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:49,547
Lao-Tzu says, "Free from desire,
"you realize the mystery.

309
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,994
"Caught in desire,
you see only the manifestations."

310
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,658
What the fuck
that even mean, man?

311
00:12:55,736 --> 00:12:57,364
That means...

312
00:12:59,843 --> 00:13:02,679
get the fuck out.

313
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,288
Well, I guess you don't give a fuck
about the money, then, huh?

314
00:13:10,363 --> 00:13:12,230
What money? It's a funeral!

315
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,565
Nobody get paid to sing
at no damn funeral!

316
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:17,040
How much?

317
00:13:17,109 --> 00:13:18,475
40 grand.

318
00:13:18,545 --> 00:13:20,207
Apiece?

319
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:21,476
No, down the middle.

320
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,579
No, no, no, no, no,
No, no, no, no!

321
00:13:24,656 --> 00:13:25,885
That ain't even enough.

322
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,825
What the fuck you mean
that's not enough, man?

323
00:13:27,895 --> 00:13:31,025
I got a lifestyle to maintain here.

324
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,695
What kind of lifestyle, man,

325
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,296
you filthy motherfucker?

326
00:13:34,374 --> 00:13:37,072
You got a pantry full of dog food.
I don't see no dog.

327
00:13:37,145 --> 00:13:38,671
Dog under the bed,
nigger! You lucky

328
00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:40,513
he ain't attacked your ass
when you came in.

329
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:42,578
You're the dog, motherfucker!

330
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,662
Look, man, what happened to all
that fucking money you done saved, man?

331
00:13:47,731 --> 00:13:49,963
Saved? (snickers) Shit.

332
00:13:50,035 --> 00:13:52,505
I don't remember shit from Watergate

333
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:54,099
to when the space shuttle blew up.

334
00:13:54,177 --> 00:13:55,338
Hmm. Money I saved.

335
00:13:55,413 --> 00:13:56,938
Okay, what about the royalties?
I used to get

336
00:13:57,015 --> 00:13:58,779
over $30,000 a year off that shit.

337
00:13:58,852 --> 00:14:01,618
I lost my royalties in a poker game.
All right?

338
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,922
- Poker?
- Listen here, man.

339
00:14:03,995 --> 00:14:06,158
If you serious about un-assing me

340
00:14:06,232 --> 00:14:08,201
from my lavish surroundings here,

341
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:10,171
man, you gonna have to be
a little more flexible

342
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:13,336
in your thinking. Say, oh...

343
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:14,437
60/40.

344
00:14:14,514 --> 00:14:16,608
Man, you must be higher
than a motherfucker.

345
00:14:16,684 --> 00:14:19,120
We always split shit
straight down the middle.

346
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,818
Ain't gonna be nothing to split

347
00:14:20,892 --> 00:14:22,155
if I don't show up, now, is there?

348
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:25,530
And I ain't showing up
unless I get 60% of the proceeds.

349
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:26,830
You rich anyway, motherfucker.

350
00:14:26,903 --> 00:14:29,703
I seen your little car wash
commercials on the TV.

351
00:14:29,775 --> 00:14:32,576
I transferred all my business affairs
over to my nephew.

352
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:34,673
- I'm on a fixed income, man.
- So what?

353
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,652
So your drawers!

354
00:14:36,721 --> 00:14:38,384
That's why that 20 damn
thousand dollars

355
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,393
- look good to me right now.
- 16!

356
00:14:40,461 --> 00:14:43,365
That's your cut of a 60/40 split.

357
00:14:43,434 --> 00:14:44,925
And those are my terms.

358
00:14:45,003 --> 00:14:46,973
And they're non-negotiable.

359
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,807
55/45.

360
00:14:59,096 --> 00:15:00,860
Fatherfuck you, man.

361
00:15:00,932 --> 00:15:03,665
You're gonna tell me 60/40.

362
00:15:03,738 --> 00:15:05,536
You don't dictate to me!

363
00:15:05,607 --> 00:15:08,043
I'm Floyd motherfucking Henderson.

364
00:15:08,112 --> 00:15:09,638
You and Marc, I made you

365
00:15:09,715 --> 00:15:11,240
and that motherfucker!

366
00:15:11,318 --> 00:15:14,518
You can't sing, hum,
or motherfucking skip.

367
00:15:14,591 --> 00:15:15,923
Ain't that a bitch?

368
00:15:15,993 --> 00:15:17,792
Skip on these motherfucking nuts!

369
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:21,402
You and Marcus, may you rest in shit.

370
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,166
Motherfucker.
I'm Floyd fucking Henderson,

371
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,437
you Apostle-faced motherfucker!

372
00:15:25,511 --> 00:15:26,501
(slam)

373
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,073
This motherfucker slams this door
in my face one more time...

374
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:30,744
I'm tired of this motherfucker!

375
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,188
Always had a problem with this bitch.

376
00:15:35,596 --> 00:15:37,190
He ain't nothing. He's ignorant!

377
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:39,429
Motherfucker's just a idiot.

378
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:41,973
Chihuahua-head motherfucker, man,
sitting up there,

379
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,136
always want to tell
somebody what to damn do.

380
00:15:44,212 --> 00:15:46,648
He gonna sit there and talk the fool?

381
00:15:46,717 --> 00:15:49,552
Ooh, my blood pressure's
high, motherfucker.

382
00:15:49,622 --> 00:15:50,715
Huh!

383
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,430
(sigh)

384
00:15:56,501 --> 00:15:58,937
Don't let this motherfucker
get you like this.

385
00:16:00,775 --> 00:16:01,765
Huhh!

386
00:16:03,447 --> 00:16:05,109
(imitating dog barking)

387
00:16:05,183 --> 00:16:06,310
What!

388
00:16:06,386 --> 00:16:07,376
Stay!

389
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:16,001
First of all, I clearly want
to state this for the record.

390
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,201
And I find this arrangement we got,
man, despicable.

391
00:16:19,276 --> 00:16:21,872
But I'm Floyd Henderson.
I'm a trouper.

392
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,349
And you know I'd do
any doggone thing, man,

393
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:26,252
to see this group get back on its feet,

394
00:16:26,322 --> 00:16:28,188
'cause you know
that's the type of motherfucker I am.

395
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:29,728
But in the meantime,

396
00:16:29,796 --> 00:16:33,428
I'm going back
to my $600-a-night hotel room,

397
00:16:33,502 --> 00:16:36,268
and I'm gonna have me
a nice hot bubble bath

398
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,867
to wash some of this
filth and dirt and grime

399
00:16:38,945 --> 00:16:42,008
from this black
fucking hole you live in.

400
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:45,524
Then I'm having me
a nice, juicy-ass steak, oh, yeah,

401
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:48,357
the size of your
motherfucking back.

402
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:51,526
Then I'm gonna take me
a shit shower and shave.

403
00:16:51,602 --> 00:16:53,572
And I'll be here at 6 a.m.

404
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,107
To take you to the motherfucking
airport.

405
00:16:55,175 --> 00:16:56,370
You got me? I don't fly.

406
00:16:56,444 --> 00:16:57,673
And I get up at 8.

407
00:16:59,282 --> 00:17:00,683
(slam)

408
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,119
My cousin out the penitentiary,

409
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,020
I'm gonna have him kill
this motherfucker!

410
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:05,458
(distant siren)

411
00:17:05,528 --> 00:17:07,690
Man talk to me like
I'm a motherfucking kid.

412
00:17:07,766 --> 00:17:08,892
I ain't no motherfucking kid.

413
00:17:08,968 --> 00:17:11,301
Every time we... we start on the road,

414
00:17:11,372 --> 00:17:14,138
he starts in saying the same shit.

415
00:17:14,344 --> 00:17:16,610
(Danny Epstein)
Hey! Who's got my lunch?

416
00:17:16,681 --> 00:17:17,614
Who are you?

417
00:17:17,683 --> 00:17:18,742
I'm Phillip Newman, sir,

418
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,151
the new intern. You hired me,

419
00:17:20,221 --> 00:17:21,416
like, 20 minutes ago.

420
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,958
Chuckles Newman's my uncle.

421
00:17:23,026 --> 00:17:24,358
- He's the one that told you...
- Stop talking.

422
00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:26,091
Very good. I already got a job for you.

423
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,725
Okay? Bing, bang, boom.
Look at that.

424
00:17:27,802 --> 00:17:30,295
Yeah. Henderson and Hinds,
Marcus' old backup singers,

425
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:32,206
are being real dickheads
about this tribute thing...

426
00:17:32,277 --> 00:17:34,474
Oh, my God! Henderson and Hinds!
The Real Deal.

427
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:36,141
They're the only band
that got to play three songs

428
00:17:36,217 --> 00:17:37,617
on a sing episode of Soul Train.

429
00:17:37,687 --> 00:17:40,351
Don Cornelius was there as a witness,
and I got it on VHS.

430
00:17:40,425 --> 00:17:41,950
They don't do that here. All right?

431
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,691
- Yes, sir.
- This is a record label,

432
00:17:43,765 --> 00:17:44,824
not a fan club.

433
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,869
I want those two old fucks
there on Saturday,

434
00:17:46,937 --> 00:17:48,566
and I want you to make that happen.

435
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,572
Got it?

Uh-huh.

442
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,292
Ohh! Shit.

Ohh...

444
00:18:24,373 --> 00:18:25,807
What the fuck is that, man?

445
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,275
This is a gun.

446
00:18:27,344 --> 00:18:29,576
I never travel through Klan country
without one.

447
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:31,140
- You got a problem with that, pops?
- Yeah,

448
00:18:31,218 --> 00:18:32,379
I got a problem with that, man.

449
00:18:32,453 --> 00:18:33,854
The last time I saw that gun,

450
00:18:33,924 --> 00:18:35,449
you were pointing at me,
and you were shooting it.

451
00:18:35,526 --> 00:18:37,758
Listen here, Floyd.
We ain't two old friends

452
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,889
out for some Sunday drive

453
00:18:38,966 --> 00:18:40,264
down Memory Lane. All right?

454
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:43,238
Fact is, I can hardly stand
the sight of your ass,

455
00:18:43,307 --> 00:18:45,675
so you best not to provoke me.

456
00:18:45,744 --> 00:18:46,871
Or what's gonna happen?

457
00:18:46,947 --> 00:18:48,610
There's a lot of empty road

458
00:18:48,684 --> 00:18:50,881
between here and where we trying to go.

459
00:18:50,955 --> 00:18:52,082
Where a nigger could disappear

460
00:18:52,157 --> 00:18:53,921
and where nobody'd
miss his black ass.

461
00:18:55,763 --> 00:18:57,664
Well, let me see that gun.

462
00:18:58,902 --> 00:19:00,462
Let me see it!

463
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,802
Be careful, fool.

464
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,844
You don't think I know
how to hold a gun, man?

465
00:19:03,912 --> 00:19:05,505
I'm a member of the NRA, man.

00:19:18,472 --> 00:19:19,701
Grab the wheel, fool!

00:19:19,774 --> 00:19:22,905
- Look out!
- Now, turn! Turn!

00:19:24,983 --> 00:19:25,916
Ohh!

What the hell is wrong with you!

480
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:29,688
Don't shoot no gun in a car!

481
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:32,526
You said... The safety
wasn't on there.

482
00:19:32,598 --> 00:19:34,396
Safety, my ass!

483
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:35,867
Safety wasn't...

484
00:19:35,936 --> 00:19:36,926

Been a long time
since we saw our name in lights.

494
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,552
What our name doing up in lights?

495
00:20:25,661 --> 00:20:27,722
We're at the Apollo Theater
this weekend.

496
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:30,065
We ain't been on stage
in over 30 years.

497
00:20:30,137 --> 00:20:31,730
Now, the last thing you want to do

498
00:20:31,806 --> 00:20:33,435
is stink up the joint. Am I right?

499
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,172

weren't squeezing my nuts so tight.

Maybe it'll help you
hit those high notes.

506
00:20:56,485 --> 00:20:59,047
I don't need help
hitting the high notes.

* Don't have to worry *

535
00:22:12,825 --> 00:22:15,021
- * 'Cause I'm here *
- Yeah.

536
00:22:15,096 --> 00:22:17,224
* No need to summon me there *

537
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:18,666
* 'Cause I'm here *

538
00:22:18,736 --> 00:22:19,897
* Yea-ah *

539
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,701
* Hold on *

540
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:23,299
* I'm coming *

541
00:22:23,377 --> 00:22:26,042
- Yipes!
- (crashing)

542
00:22:26,116 --> 00:22:28,211
* I'm coming *

543
00:22:28,287 --> 00:22:30,085
* Just hold on *

544
00:22:31,092 --> 00:22:32,890
* I'm coming *

545
00:22:32,961 --> 00:22:35,158
* Just hold on *

546
00:22:35,232 --> 00:22:36,291
* I'm coming *

547
00:22:36,368 --> 00:22:37,301
(microphone feedback)

548
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:41,241
Look here. Reach out to me

549
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,678
for some satisfaction.

550
00:22:45,351 --> 00:22:46,944
You know, Floyd, all she got to do

551
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,787
- * Is call my name *
- (feedback squeals)

552
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,387
* For quick reaction *

553
00:22:52,464 --> 00:22:54,057
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

554
00:22:54,134 --> 00:22:55,102
* Yeah *

555
00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:56,102
- (feedback squealing)
- * Yeah *

556
00:22:56,171 --> 00:22:57,104
Ooh! Aah!

557
00:22:57,173 --> 00:22:58,436
Ooh!

558
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:00,638
Ooh! Ooh, ooh! Ooh!

559
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,045
Aaah!

560
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:04,711
(coughing)

561
00:23:04,787 --> 00:23:06,278
Lou, Lou, you all right?
You all right?

562
00:23:06,356 --> 00:23:09,089
(coughing, choking)
I can't breathe!

563
00:23:09,162 --> 00:23:10,391
- (coughing)
- Louis.

564
00:23:10,464 --> 00:23:12,160
(coughs) Ohh!
Keep going. Keep going.

565
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:13,166
I can't breathe.

566
00:23:13,235 --> 00:23:16,901
(coughing)

567
00:23:19,146 --> 00:23:20,808
Ladies and gentlemen,
please forgive us

568
00:23:20,883 --> 00:23:21,941
for this technical difficulty.

569
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:23,419
- (bonk)
- Ow!

570
00:23:23,488 --> 00:23:24,786
Aah!

571
00:23:24,857 --> 00:23:26,689
Fucking eye, man!

572
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,787
I'm sorry, man.
I got on these tight slacks!

573
00:23:28,864 --> 00:23:30,595
Well, then, I'll sue your fat ass!

574
00:23:30,668 --> 00:23:31,636
You sue these nuts.

575
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:33,467
- Go on, get on outta here.
- Jesus!

576
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:34,700
Take it from the top.

577
00:23:34,775 --> 00:23:36,175
How are we gonna
take it from the top?

578
00:23:36,244 --> 00:23:37,611
- I'm revved up to go, man,
- You can't hardly breathe.

579
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:38,876
- You may need a chest X-ray.
- I'm good!

580
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,145
Is there a doctor in the house?

581
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:42,120
I love you, Debbie.

582
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:44,351
- Get off me, Ernest T!
- (thud)

583
00:23:44,426 --> 00:23:46,157
Lou. Lou. Lou. Calm down, man.

584
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,858
Ain't but 12 motherfuckers out here, man.

585
00:23:47,932 --> 00:23:49,457
It's still a audience!

586
00:23:49,536 --> 00:23:51,698
I don't care if it's two or three.
It's a audience.

587
00:23:51,772 --> 00:23:52,865
That's what I'm talking about.

588
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:54,342
Your attitude is f'd up.

589
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:56,676
Same thing that messed us up
back in the day.

590
00:23:56,749 --> 00:23:58,877
No. You know what fucked our shit up
back in the day?

591
00:23:58,952 --> 00:23:59,885
No. I don't know.

592
00:23:59,954 --> 00:24:01,320
Oh, you know goddamn well

593
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,653
what fucked our shit up back in the day.

594
00:24:02,727 --> 00:24:04,389
- Oh, I do, huh?
- Yes, you do!

595
00:24:04,463 --> 00:24:06,330
What fucked our shit up
back in the day

596
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,100
was you sticking your johnson
in my woman!

597
00:24:10,173 --> 00:24:11,903
- (murmuring)
- Ooh.

598
00:24:15,851 --> 00:24:17,752
(footsteps)

599
00:24:23,531 --> 00:24:25,433
(chuckling)
Ladies and gentlemen,

600
00:24:25,502 --> 00:24:26,731
I'm Floyd Henderson.

601
00:24:26,804 --> 00:24:28,432
This fool is Louis Hinds.

602
00:24:28,507 --> 00:24:31,103
We are The Real Deal,
and that's for real.

603
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:35,551
I want to thank you for being
a super audience here tonight.

604
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,487
(softly)
Motherfucker.

605
00:24:37,557 --> 00:24:39,789
I'm sorry I hit you, Debbie. Come back.

606
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:42,388
Shut the fuck up,
or I'll knock your dick in the dirt.

607
00:24:43,468 --> 00:24:44,800
- Drunk son of a bitch.
- (feedback squeals)

608
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,031
Ohh...

609
00:24:48,277 --> 00:24:49,438
(moans)

610
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,614
* Happy *

611
00:24:51,682 --> 00:24:53,584
Hey, Louis, are we gonna talk
about last night,

612
00:24:53,653 --> 00:24:55,144
or we just gonna let it fester?

613
00:24:57,259 --> 00:25:00,595
All right. Well, I was
a little rusty, okay?

614
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,259
That's a insult to rust, ain't it?

615
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:03,929
Well, what about you,
motherfucker?

616
00:25:04,006 --> 00:25:06,738
Last night, look like you were
stuck in cement.

617
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,005
I had a hip replacement, Louis.

618
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,708
Well, you should've paid
a hundred more dollars

619
00:25:09,783 --> 00:25:11,809
and got the deluxe model
with some rhythm in it.

620
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:13,719
'Cause that motherfucker you got,

621
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,885
- it ain't working.
- Oh, that's fine, man.

622
00:25:15,961 --> 00:25:17,020
But that's not what we talking about.

623
00:25:17,096 --> 00:25:18,655
I'm talking about Odetta.

624
00:25:19,668 --> 00:25:20,727
Oh.

625
00:25:20,803 --> 00:25:21,998
Louis, if I thought there was still

626
00:25:22,072 --> 00:25:23,540
- gonna be a problem between us...
- You went

627
00:25:23,608 --> 00:25:25,510
where you shouldn't have gone,

628
00:25:25,578 --> 00:25:26,978
period!

629
00:25:27,048 --> 00:25:28,175
Now, there's some shit

630
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,083
that's just etched in stone.

631
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:32,055
First and foremost is

632
00:25:32,123 --> 00:25:36,530
thou shall not dig for diamonds
in another brother's mine!

633
00:25:36,598 --> 00:25:39,330
Bullshit, man. You gotta take
some responsibility here.

634
00:25:39,403 --> 00:25:40,496
You think she didn't know, man,

635
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:41,699
about all of your smoking

636
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:43,003
and drinking and drugs

637
00:25:43,077 --> 00:25:44,546
and other women? She knew.

638
00:25:44,613 --> 00:25:46,605
She came running to me
telling, "My man

639
00:25:46,683 --> 00:25:49,678
Louis did this. Louis did that.
Hold me, Floyd."

640
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,088
All right, well, getting the pussy
is one thing.

641
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:52,592
- You ain't had to marry her.
- What?

642
00:25:52,661 --> 00:25:54,062
You'd have to be a zip-down fool

643
00:25:54,131 --> 00:25:55,793
to let her slide
through your fingers, man.

644
00:25:55,867 --> 00:25:57,598
All right, well, if I'm a fool,
then you are, too.

645
00:25:57,671 --> 00:26:00,437
You think I don't know that?
She hurt my heart, too.

646
00:26:00,509 --> 00:26:04,073
Good!
That's a poor motherfucking comfort.

647
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:07,417
But it's comfort, nonetheless.

648
00:26:07,489 --> 00:26:08,718
* Every night I'm telling *

649
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:10,316
* Whoopie *

650
00:26:10,393 --> 00:26:12,454
* Every time you're here, you're making *

651
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:14,398
- * Whoopie *
- Whool

652
00:26:14,468 --> 00:26:15,959
* Whoopie *

653
00:26:25,288 --> 00:26:28,282
Well, how many times did you say
you was married after Odetta?

654
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,792
(sighs) Four.

655
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:32,925
Ohh!

656
00:26:33,002 --> 00:26:35,940
I married this girl named Estelle
to get over Odetta.

657
00:26:36,008 --> 00:26:37,476
Then I married Henrietta.

658
00:26:37,544 --> 00:26:39,741
She wasn't no good for me.

659
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:41,113
Then I married Josephine.

660
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:44,156
She definitely wasn't no good for me
because she met Carl.

661
00:26:44,223 --> 00:26:46,215
All right. That's three.

662
00:26:46,293 --> 00:26:47,990
Who was lucky number four?

663
00:26:48,063 --> 00:26:49,895
Her name was Consuelo.

664
00:26:49,966 --> 00:26:50,899
(Louis grunts)

665
00:26:50,968 --> 00:26:52,597
She left me and went back to Cuba.

666
00:26:52,672 --> 00:26:55,666
Ha ha ha!
People actually go back to Cuba?

667
00:26:55,743 --> 00:26:57,838
She said she'd rather
spend the rest of her life

668
00:26:57,914 --> 00:27:00,248
under that dictatorship
than spend another night with me.

669
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:01,548
(grunts)

670
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,919
How 'bout you?
How come you never got married?

671
00:27:04,994 --> 00:27:07,829
I almost hooked up
with this girl down in the Philippines,

672
00:27:07,899 --> 00:27:08,889
in Manila.

673
00:27:10,303 --> 00:27:13,104
- Wow.
- But, uh, I couldn't learn to speak

674
00:27:13,176 --> 00:27:15,271
Tagalog, and only English she knew

675
00:27:15,347 --> 00:27:17,339
was, "Me love you
long time for two dollar."

676
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:19,545
(both chuckle)

677
00:27:19,621 --> 00:27:22,616
Yeah, I wasn't no good
at relationships after Odetta.

678
00:27:22,693 --> 00:27:23,991
You ever hear from her?

679
00:27:24,062 --> 00:27:25,291
Who, Mai Mai?

680
00:27:25,365 --> 00:27:26,298
No. Odetta.

681
00:27:26,367 --> 00:27:28,360
Oh. No, man.

682
00:27:29,673 --> 00:27:30,834
I heard from her, man.

683
00:27:30,909 --> 00:27:32,377
It was sometime around Christmas.

684
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:35,313
You know, in that place
she was living in Tulsa. You know?

685
00:27:35,383 --> 00:27:36,612
(muttering)

686
00:27:36,685 --> 00:27:38,621
Fuck it.
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.

687
00:27:38,689 --> 00:27:40,318
What you doing?

688
00:27:40,393 --> 00:27:42,123
- I saw a coyote.
- Whyn't you put that thing up

689
00:27:42,195 --> 00:27:43,493
before somebody get hurt, man?

690
00:27:43,564 --> 00:27:44,930
How come you think
I don't know how to handle

691
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,367
- no damn piece, man?
- Think?

692
00:27:47,405 --> 00:27:48,931
I know.

693
00:27:49,008 --> 00:27:50,977
Yeah? (chuckles)

694
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:53,379
Yeah, come fuck with me now, Louis.

695
00:27:53,449 --> 00:27:54,918
Come on. You think I'm soft, huh?

696
00:27:54,986 --> 00:27:57,980
Yeah. (chuckles)
I'll bust one in your ass.

697
00:27:58,058 --> 00:27:59,652
Floyd, you keep fucking around,

698
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:01,560
I'm gonna stick that gun
so far up your ass,

699
00:28:01,631 --> 00:28:03,464
you gonna taste gunpowder
every time you talk.

700
00:28:03,535 --> 00:28:05,367
- Well, let me...
- Shit!

701
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:07,340
(hissing)

702
00:28:10,715 --> 00:28:12,013
God damn it!

703
00:28:12,084 --> 00:28:13,643
Louis, that was a accident. I swear.

704
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,815
I'm sweating. My hand's wet.

705
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,324
You all right?

706
00:28:17,394 --> 00:28:18,862
You warm? You hot?

707
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,796
You dizzy? You light-headed?

708
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,166
Louis, I swear I would never want
to hurt you, man.

709
00:28:23,237 --> 00:28:25,469
I thought about killing you,
but I'd never want to hurt you.

710
00:28:25,541 --> 00:28:28,011
All right.
In our continuing tribute to Marcus Hooks,

711
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:30,744
we're reaching all the way back
in this next song.

712
00:28:30,818 --> 00:28:33,721
Lou. That's us, man.

713
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,783
- Listen.
...Martin Hooks and The Real Deal.

714
00:28:35,861 --> 00:28:39,425
Number 3 in 1969...
"I'm Your Puppet."

715
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:40,867
(turns volume up)

716
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:44,270
* Pull the string *

717
00:28:44,343 --> 00:28:46,745
* And I'll wink at you *

718
00:28:46,814 --> 00:28:48,613

719

720
00:28:50,821 --> 00:28:52,586
* Mm-hmm, yeah *

721
00:28:52,658 --> 00:28:54,491
* I'll do funny things *

722
00:28:54,562 --> 00:28:57,192
* If you want me to *

723
00:28:57,267 --> 00:28:58,428
* I'm your puppet *

724
00:28:58,502 --> 00:28:59,435
***

725
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:00,529
Come on, Lou.

726

727
00:29:02,977 --> 00:29:05,539
(laughs)

728
00:29:05,615 --> 00:29:08,279
I'll say this for him...
that motherfucker could sing.

729
00:29:08,353 --> 00:29:10,755
No doubt. No doubt.
Come on, help me... help me out.

730
00:29:10,825 --> 00:29:11,918
- Second verse.
- Second?

731
00:29:11,993 --> 00:29:13,120
"Pull my strings." Kiss.

732
00:29:13,196 --> 00:29:14,129
*... your puppet *

733
00:29:14,198 --> 00:29:15,826
- What...
- You ready?

734
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,802
1, 2, 3.

735
00:29:17,871 --> 00:29:18,804
Hit it.

736
00:29:18,873 --> 00:29:20,171
* Pull another string *

737
00:29:20,242 --> 00:29:23,077
*... ing, and I'll kiss your lips *

738
00:29:23,148 --> 00:29:24,639
(Both)
* I'm your puppet *

739
00:29:24,717 --> 00:29:26,949
* Ohh, ohh, ohh *

740
00:29:27,021 --> 00:29:28,785
- Tap.
- * Yeah *

741
00:29:28,858 --> 00:29:30,919

742
00:29:30,995 --> 00:29:32,020
* And I'll turn *

743
00:29:32,097 --> 00:29:33,395

* I'm your puppet *

745
00:29:34,735 --> 00:29:37,707
- Man, my hip hurt like anything.
- Drop step.

746
00:29:37,774 --> 00:29:40,802
Drop step?
You know I can't do that right now.

747
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,813
Go, Lou.

748
00:29:41,882 --> 00:29:43,214
- Owww!
- Man.

749
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:45,915
Oh, sweet. Do it, Louie.

750
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:46,922

751
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:48,688
Oh! Oh! Oh!

(both)
* I'm your puppet *

753
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:53,895
- * Oh, yes, I am *
- One more time.

754
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,439
- There you go, Floyd.
- * I'm your puppet *

755
00:29:55,507 --> 00:29:56,702
Oh! Come on now.

00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:03,750
So where'd you book us next?

760
00:30:03,822 --> 00:30:05,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

761
00:30:06,894 --> 00:30:08,157
(Louis)
This is it?

762
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,564

763
00:30:16,545 --> 00:30:18,572

780
00:30:51,677 --> 00:30:53,043
What is it?

781
00:30:53,113 --> 00:30:55,082
- * Boogie on down *
- Whoo-hoo!

782
00:30:55,149 --> 00:30:56,378

783
00:30:56,452 --> 00:30:59,184
* Boogie on down *

784
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,316
* Listen to the band *

785
00:31:00,393 --> 00:31:02,488
* We'll make it through *

786
00:31:02,563 --> 00:31:05,125
* All we got *

787
00:31:05,201 --> 00:31:07,569

788
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:09,609

(both)

793
00:31:18,225 --> 00:31:21,492
Hey, you, what you got, baby?
You got to boogie for me?

794
00:31:21,565 --> 00:31:24,968
Come on, now.
* Oh, yeah *

795
00:31:25,037 --> 00:31:27,007
(Floyd)
Come on.

796
00:31:27,075 --> 00:31:29,011
Yeehaw!

797
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:31,311
(Floyd)
Come on, fiddler.

798
00:31:31,383 --> 00:31:33,478
I knew you were
gonna try to take over.

799
00:31:34,756 --> 00:31:37,158
Look at him.

800
00:31:37,227 --> 00:31:39,629
Go on, Lou.

801
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:41,667
- Come on.
- Oww!

802
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:43,398
(both)
* Boogie ain't nothing *

803
00:31:43,472 --> 00:31:45,567
* But gettin' down *

804
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:47,804
* Boogie ain't nothing *

805
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,248
* But gettin' down *

806
00:31:50,318 --> 00:31:52,982
* Boogie ain't nothing
but getting down *

807
00:31:53,056 --> 00:31:54,149
Ow!

808
00:31:54,225 --> 00:31:56,057
* Boogie ain't nothing *

809
00:31:56,128 --> 00:31:57,893
* But getting down *

810
00:31:57,965 --> 00:32:00,401
Come on.
* I got to boogie for you *

811
00:32:00,469 --> 00:32:02,769
* I got to boogie for you *

812
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,901
* I got to boogie for you *

813
00:32:04,978 --> 00:32:07,073
* I got to boogie for you *

814
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:09,585
* I got nothing but boogie *

815
00:32:09,653 --> 00:32:11,782
- * Nothing but boogie for you *
- * Ooh *

816
00:32:11,857 --> 00:32:13,519
- * I got nothing but boogie *
- * Yeah *

817
00:32:13,593 --> 00:32:15,027
* Nothing but boogie for you *

818
00:32:15,096 --> 00:32:17,761
- * Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie *

819
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:20,135

- * Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie *
- * Oh, yeah *

821
00:32:21,975 --> 00:32:23,808

822
00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:27,078
Aah!

823
00:32:27,151 --> 00:32:30,055
(crowd cheering)

824
00:32:32,995 --> 00:32:35,022
Share the love, baby.

825
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:37,296
All right, all right.

826
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,134
You know you pulled
the Al Green up there, right?

827
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,904
No, I didn't, Lou. Don't start that...

828
00:32:40,977 --> 00:32:42,104
We barely got offstage

829
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:43,841
when you ran your ass
back out there.

830
00:32:43,915 --> 00:32:46,512
Look, an encore
is at the audience's discretion.

831
00:32:46,588 --> 00:32:48,147
You're supposed to wait
till they ask for it.

832
00:32:48,224 --> 00:32:49,920
- You know they wanted it.
- I don't care what they wanted.

833
00:32:49,993 --> 00:32:51,758
That shit was unprofessional.

834
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,162
Man...

835
00:32:57,139 --> 00:32:58,438
Say,

836
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,811
I'm starting to remember
why I love the road so much.

837
00:33:01,882 --> 00:33:04,318
Yeah.

838
00:33:04,387 --> 00:33:05,753
(laughing)

839
00:33:07,158 --> 00:33:10,392
Mmm.

840
00:33:10,465 --> 00:33:12,525
If my instincts serve me right,

841
00:33:12,601 --> 00:33:14,662
you're about to find
yourself another room tonight.

842
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:17,575
You know those little blue pills
make you go blind, right?

843
00:33:17,645 --> 00:33:19,614
Mmm, mmm.

844
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:21,047
(laughing)

845
00:33:21,118 --> 00:33:23,611
Don't call me when you get
that four-hour erection.

846
00:33:23,689 --> 00:33:25,214
(Floyd)
Hey, now, baby girl.

847
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:28,024
(both moaning)

848
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,827
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

849
00:33:30,902 --> 00:33:32,768
Oh. Aah!

850
00:33:32,838 --> 00:33:33,931
Yeah, give it to me.

851
00:33:34,007 --> 00:33:35,373
(moaning)

852
00:33:35,444 --> 00:33:37,003
Those little pills, give me strength.

853
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,241
A little strength.

854
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,217
- (moaning)
- Ugh!

855
00:33:40,286 --> 00:33:41,549
I'm going to fuck your brains out.

856
00:33:41,622 --> 00:33:44,388
Oh! Oh, you're heavy.

857
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,794
(moaning)

858
00:33:46,864 --> 00:33:48,230
Uh,

859
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,429
what's wrong, baby?

860
00:33:50,504 --> 00:33:51,767
Nothing.

861
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,142
I just, uh, you know, l...

862
00:33:55,213 --> 00:33:57,410
I just never been with
someone like you before.

863
00:33:57,484 --> 00:34:00,148
It's true what they say.
But let me tell you something.

864
00:34:00,222 --> 00:34:02,590
Floyd Henderson gonna be
nice and gentle.

865
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,357
Your first taste of dark meat

866
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,262
gonna be smooth and sweet, trust me.

867
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:07,494
No, I didn't mean that.

868
00:34:07,569 --> 00:34:09,869
It's just, uh, you know,

869
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,276
I've never been with someone so old.

870
00:34:13,346 --> 00:34:14,507
Old?

871
00:34:14,582 --> 00:34:17,178
You ain't no teen queen
your damn self.

872
00:34:17,253 --> 00:34:19,120
Huh.

873
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,453
Come on, come on, come on.

874
00:34:20,526 --> 00:34:22,120
Come on, mama. Come here, baby.

875
00:34:22,196 --> 00:34:23,425
Baby, baby. Look here.

876
00:34:23,499 --> 00:34:26,698
Let's take our decades
of sexual experience

877
00:34:26,771 --> 00:34:28,468
and combine them for one night

878
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:30,339
of exploration and bliss,
can we do that?

879
00:34:30,411 --> 00:34:32,608
- I won't disappoint you.
- (chuckling)

880
00:34:32,682 --> 00:34:34,481
I won't disappoint you.

881
00:34:34,552 --> 00:34:36,818
- (both chuckling)
- All right.

882
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:38,951
That's what I'm talking about.

883
00:34:39,027 --> 00:34:40,359
I want to suck one of them titties.

884
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,900
Oh, yeah? Well, I got
something to show you.

885
00:34:42,967 --> 00:34:44,060
- Ooh.
- Ooh, hoo.

886
00:34:44,136 --> 00:34:46,333
I'm so hot, I'm about to fuck myself.

887
00:34:46,407 --> 00:34:47,500
(moaning)

888
00:34:47,576 --> 00:34:48,601
Bite my lip off.

889
00:34:48,678 --> 00:34:50,544
Oh. Look!

890
00:34:50,614 --> 00:34:52,049
Oh, shoot, I'm leaking, girl.

891
00:34:52,118 --> 00:34:53,711
Tonight I ain't got no
control like that no more.

892
00:34:53,787 --> 00:34:57,521
Now, I hope you don't
mind a little hair.

893
00:34:57,594 --> 00:35:01,328
Baby, I found
my sexual awakening in the '60s.

894
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:04,931
Nothing I like better
than a big old fluffy...

895
00:35:07,212 --> 00:35:08,373
Damn, girl.

896
00:35:08,447 --> 00:35:10,383
That's a whole bunch of hair
you got down there.

897
00:35:10,451 --> 00:35:12,421
Yeah, I call it the natural look.

898
00:35:13,456 --> 00:35:14,789
You sick?

899
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,658
I know it's big.

900
00:35:16,729 --> 00:35:18,323
You need a pick.

901
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:19,697
You want me to shave it?

902
00:35:19,769 --> 00:35:22,934
We ain't got the time or
apparatus for that type of job.

903
00:35:23,007 --> 00:35:24,738
- Okay, disregard.
- (unzipping)

904
00:35:24,811 --> 00:35:25,938
Oh!

905
00:35:26,013 --> 00:35:27,174
- Oh!
- Oh!

906
00:35:27,249 --> 00:35:29,776
Look who's coming to dinner.

907
00:35:29,853 --> 00:35:31,686
Right on time, ain't it?

908
00:35:31,757 --> 00:35:33,191
They call me Mr. Tibbs.

909
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,922
Oh.

910
00:35:34,996 --> 00:35:36,055
You know what I'm
gonna do for you?

911
00:35:36,131 --> 00:35:37,532
What you fixing to do?

912
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:39,467
You ever had a velveteen rub?

913
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:41,906
A velveteen rub.

914
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:44,377
Ain't... Ain't no cheese involved, is there?

915
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:46,348
Because I'm lactose intolerant.

916
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:48,910
(laughing)

917
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,758
Oh, yeah.

918
00:35:58,206 --> 00:36:00,904
(screaming)

919
00:36:00,977 --> 00:36:03,379
(wailing)

920
00:36:03,448 --> 00:36:04,711
Ooh!

921
00:36:04,784 --> 00:36:06,344
You're choking my chicken!

922
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:08,117
(wailing)

923
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:19,703
Ugh!

924
00:36:20,747 --> 00:36:22,113
Ugh.

925
00:36:22,183 --> 00:36:24,153
That's quite a show you got going

926
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,189
under the big top there, Sparky.

927
00:36:26,257 --> 00:36:27,726
I had to take another
one of them damn pills

928
00:36:27,793 --> 00:36:29,022
in the middle of the night, man.

929
00:36:29,096 --> 00:36:31,065
This woman insatiable, man.
I'm shooting dust.

930
00:36:31,132 --> 00:36:33,034
- (laughing)
- (exhales)

931
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:34,036
(Woman)
Oh, Floyd.

932
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:35,232
I'm right here, baby.

933
00:36:35,307 --> 00:36:36,468
You ready for some more?

934
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:37,567
Yeah, come here.

935
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:39,204
(both moaning)

936
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:41,046
Come here.

937
00:36:41,118 --> 00:36:42,347
Come here.

938
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,445
Hi.

939
00:36:43,522 --> 00:36:46,220
Think about that, boy.

940
00:36:46,294 --> 00:36:48,355
There's my stallion.
(giggling)

941
00:36:48,431 --> 00:36:49,694
Huh?

942
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:51,429
- I missed you.
- Oh, you missed me?

943
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:52,596
Mmm-hmm.

944
00:36:52,672 --> 00:36:54,642
Mmm. You need a little air
on this thing.

945
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:56,804
(Woman)
Yeah. (laughing)

946
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,077
Oh, you bad boy.

947
00:36:59,151 --> 00:37:00,779
God damn.

948
00:37:00,853 --> 00:37:02,413
- (meowing)
- You like that, huh?

949
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,083
I'm your little kitty cat.
(laughing)

950
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,926
(Woman meowing)

951
00:37:06,998 --> 00:37:08,467
Chastity?

952
00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:10,459
Mama?

953
00:37:10,538 --> 00:37:11,699
Mama?

954
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:13,002
You little whore.

955
00:37:13,077 --> 00:37:14,545
You're one to talk.

956
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:17,014
Oh, did you take out
your teeth for him?

957
00:37:17,084 --> 00:37:19,077
You watch how you talk to your mama.

958
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,747
Please, you can't
talk to me like that.

959
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:21,883
You're not my daddy.

960
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:22,984
That's right, who's your daddy?

961
00:37:23,061 --> 00:37:24,188
- You're my daddy.
- Your big daddy.

962
00:37:24,263 --> 00:37:25,492
(banging)

963
00:37:25,566 --> 00:37:27,057
(Man yelling)
Rosalee, are you in there?

964
00:37:27,135 --> 00:37:29,662
Actually, that's my daddy.

965
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,935
Oh.

966
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:33,206
(Man yelling)

967
00:37:33,279 --> 00:37:34,372
What are you thinking, Mama?

968
00:37:34,448 --> 00:37:35,473
You ruined everything.

969
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,611
- I hate you.
- You little brat.

970
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:39,783
You're a dirty... all right, I love you.

971
00:37:39,859 --> 00:37:41,384
- Mmm.
- Call me a lot of times.

972
00:37:41,461 --> 00:37:43,761
Mama, what is wrong with you?

973
00:37:43,832 --> 00:37:46,064
- I renounce you. You're a whore.
- Aah!

974
00:37:46,137 --> 00:37:47,902
- I'm a whore?
- Yeah.

975
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:50,501
You just shamed the whole family,
you and the black man.

976
00:37:50,745 --> 00:37:53,842
(tires squealing)

977
00:37:53,918 --> 00:37:55,216
Whoa!

978
00:37:55,287 --> 00:37:57,153
(Louis)
Whoo! That was fun.

979
00:38:04,003 --> 00:38:07,066
* So come, take me by the hand *

980
00:38:07,142 --> 00:38:09,077
* We'll leave this troubled land *

981
00:38:09,145 --> 00:38:10,705
- Yeah.
- * I know we can *

982
00:38:10,782 --> 00:38:12,011
* I know we can *

983
00:38:12,085 --> 00:38:13,280
I'll be damned, man.

984
00:38:13,353 --> 00:38:15,117
Them broads stole our money, man.

985
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,682
(Louis laughing)
Whoo, yeah,

986
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,162
but they earned it.

987
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:21,796
Hello.

988
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:23,337
Yeah, man.
It's Floyd Henderson, man.

989
00:38:23,405 --> 00:38:24,566
We got a situation.

990
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,733
What's the problem?

991
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:27,403
Well, my ex-partner,

992
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,948
the degenerate that he is, man,

993
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:32,078
got some trailer trash hos,
man, rip us off.

994
00:38:32,155 --> 00:38:33,817
Oh, wow, I'm sorry to hear that.

995
00:38:33,891 --> 00:38:35,189
Is there anything I can do?

996
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,253
Yeah, there's something
you can do. We need money.

997
00:38:37,331 --> 00:38:38,424
If we don't get no money,

998
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,968
we ain't gonna make it to the Apollo.

999
00:38:40,035 --> 00:38:42,335
I'm not sure what the procedure
for that would be.

1000
00:38:42,406 --> 00:38:44,535
I mean, there's just
a lot of red tape here.

1001
00:38:44,611 --> 00:38:46,045
You know, uh...

1002
00:38:46,113 --> 00:38:48,140
(whispering)
I'm going to have to get back to you.

1003
00:38:48,217 --> 00:38:50,813
- You do that. Get back with me now.
- Mr. Henderson...

1004
00:38:50,889 --> 00:38:53,861
We ain't gonna get very far
on ten gallons of gas,

1005
00:38:53,928 --> 00:38:56,296
I can tell you that.

1006
00:38:56,366 --> 00:38:58,130
I know where we can
get some money.

1007
00:38:58,202 --> 00:38:59,465
I know how to get some money.

1008
00:39:05,382 --> 00:39:09,880
* Ain't no love, ain't no love *

1009
00:39:09,957 --> 00:39:12,724
* Like my baby's love *

1010
00:39:12,796 --> 00:39:15,164
* Like my baby's love *

1011
00:39:15,234 --> 00:39:18,433
* Ain't no lonely days *

1012
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:21,468
* Ain't no lonely *

1013
00:39:21,545 --> 00:39:23,879
Ooh, shit. What the hell is...

1014
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:29,358
* 'Cause I ain't never,
never found me a girl *

1015
00:39:29,427 --> 00:39:31,760
Oh, hell, no. You didn't.

1016
00:39:31,831 --> 00:39:33,561
Yes, I did.

1017
00:39:33,634 --> 00:39:35,627
- * To love me like *
- * I do *

1018
00:39:35,705 --> 00:39:38,039
* Oh, yeah *

1019
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,168
Hey.

1020
00:39:39,245 --> 00:39:40,975
Hey, hey, you're...
What is wrong with you?

1021
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:42,778
Don't be grabbing on me like that now.

1022
00:39:42,851 --> 00:39:45,287
I will knock your ass out
before I let you go ring that doorbell.

1023
00:39:45,356 --> 00:39:46,790
Come on, get up
on me, man. Come on.

1024
00:39:46,858 --> 00:39:48,589
You really want this? Huh?

1025
00:39:48,662 --> 00:39:50,392
- Huh?
- Come on... Oh! God damn.

1026
00:39:50,465 --> 00:39:51,558
- Oh, man. Come on...
- What?

1027
00:39:51,634 --> 00:39:53,034
- Oh!
- What's wrong, what?

1028
00:39:53,103 --> 00:39:54,230
I got a pain in my chest, man.

1029
00:39:54,305 --> 00:39:55,831
Come on, man.
Stop fucking with me.

1030
00:39:55,908 --> 00:39:56,933
Look like I'm fucking with you, man?

1031
00:39:57,011 --> 00:39:58,104
Come on, man, do me a favor.

1032
00:39:58,179 --> 00:39:59,670
Get my heart medicine
out of my bag.

1033
00:39:59,749 --> 00:40:01,844
- You got some heart med...
- Oh! Come on, look.

1034
00:40:01,919 --> 00:40:04,185
Come on, man. Hurry up, man.

1035
00:40:06,193 --> 00:40:07,456
(Louis)
Hold on, man!

1036
00:40:08,866 --> 00:40:11,359
God damn, you got enough stuff in here
to start a drug store!

1037
00:40:11,437 --> 00:40:12,837
What it say on the bottle?

1038
00:40:12,906 --> 00:40:15,206
Sucker, motherfucker.

1039
00:40:17,113 --> 00:40:19,676
(ding dong)

1040
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:22,120
I'm gonna get your ass for this.

1041
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:24,352
I'll leave the light on for you.

1042
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:28,827
What up, dawg?

1043
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,703
Um...
(clears throat)

1044
00:40:31,774 --> 00:40:33,800
We're friends of, uh, Odetta's.

1045
00:40:33,877 --> 00:40:36,371
- Odetta?
- Yeah, is she in?

1046
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,146
No, she ain't here, man.

1047
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:40,485
Is she coming back?

1048
00:40:40,557 --> 00:40:41,752
Seriously doubt it.

1049
00:40:41,826 --> 00:40:44,992
Not unless we fitting to have
a zombie attack or some shit.

1050
00:40:45,065 --> 00:40:47,000
(laughing)
Eee!

1051
00:40:47,068 --> 00:40:48,263
What's up, Fu Manchu?

1052
00:40:48,338 --> 00:40:50,204
- Cleo!
- (Woman) Yeah?

1053
00:40:50,274 --> 00:40:51,537
Get your ass out here!

1054
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,944
Two old niggers
looking for your mama.

1055
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:58,711
Come on in, man.
You're letting the heat out.

1056
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,917
Mama?

1057
00:40:59,992 --> 00:41:01,051
Cold outside.

1058
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:02,791
Your arthritis gonna kick up.

1059
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,102
(Cleo)
Who's that?

1060
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,665
(Man)
I don't know.

1061
00:41:09,743 --> 00:41:11,440
(laughing)

1062
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:15,913
Yeah?

1063
00:41:15,989 --> 00:41:17,617
Uh, how you doing, ma'am?

1064
00:41:17,691 --> 00:41:19,057
My name is Floyd Henderson.
This is my...

1065
00:41:19,127 --> 00:41:20,994
I know who you are.

1066
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:22,726
Guess you didn't hear
about the funeral.

1067
00:41:22,801 --> 00:41:25,568
Funeral? Odetta...

1068
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,733
When did she pass?

1069
00:41:26,809 --> 00:41:28,937
Well, she got sick right after Christmas.

1070
00:41:29,013 --> 00:41:31,950
After that, it went pretty fast.

1071
00:41:32,018 --> 00:41:34,113
So why'd you come to see her?

1072
00:41:34,189 --> 00:41:35,350
What, she owe you
money or something?

1073
00:41:35,424 --> 00:41:37,656
- Oh, no.
- We just in the neighborhood.

1074
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:40,198
(Man)
Cleo, I can't find the bologna!

1075
00:41:40,266 --> 00:41:42,030
I'll be there in a minute!

1076
00:41:42,102 --> 00:41:43,833
Hurry up!
(sigh)

1077
00:41:43,906 --> 00:41:48,370
Well, if my mama wasn't dead,
I'd tell her you stopped by.

1078
00:41:48,448 --> 00:41:49,711
(Man)
Cleo!

1079
00:41:49,784 --> 00:41:52,812
- Just hold on a second.
- C-L-E-O!

1080
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:53,914
- What the hell you want?
- I'm sorry...

1081
00:41:53,991 --> 00:41:55,254
I told you this was
a bad idea to come here.

1082
00:41:55,328 --> 00:41:56,626
Come on, man. Don't go there.

1083
00:41:56,697 --> 00:41:57,722
Let's just go, okay?

1084
00:41:57,799 --> 00:41:58,823
How old you think she is?

1085
00:41:58,901 --> 00:42:00,301
27, 28?

1086
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:02,202
I don't know how old she is,
and I don't care. Let's go.

1087
00:42:02,273 --> 00:42:03,434
(Floyd)
Chillax, let me see something.

1088
00:42:03,509 --> 00:42:04,876
(Louis)
What are you doing?

1089
00:42:04,945 --> 00:42:07,141
Floyd, what the hell
are you looking for?

1090
00:42:07,215 --> 00:42:08,342
Damn it.

1091
00:42:08,418 --> 00:42:09,716
I'm just confirming a suspicion.

1092
00:42:09,787 --> 00:42:11,346
That's all I'm doing.

1093
00:42:11,423 --> 00:42:14,554
September 14, 1981. Bingo.

1094
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,862
It kind of works it self out, don't it?

1095
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,129
(Louis)
Put it back.

1096
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,000
Listen.

1097
00:42:21,074 --> 00:42:22,474
Odetta left me, man,

1098
00:42:22,544 --> 00:42:25,175
Thanksgiving Day, man, 1980.

1099
00:42:25,249 --> 00:42:27,241
- So?
- So you do the math, motherfucker.

1100
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:29,881
Do the math? Nigga, please...

1101
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:31,392
- ** (bass line)
- Oh, shit. You hear that?

1102
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,655
Hear what?

1103
00:42:32,729 --> 00:42:35,393
Listen, that bass line, right there.

1104
00:42:35,467 --> 00:42:37,630
Hmm?

1105
00:42:37,705 --> 00:42:39,435
(laughing)
Son of a bitch.

1106
00:42:39,642 --> 00:42:42,875
* Oh, my name is Lester,
the Court Jester *

1107
00:42:42,948 --> 00:42:44,918
* All you other rap niggas
done messed up *

1108
00:42:44,985 --> 00:42:46,476
* I take you to school a semester *

1109
00:42:46,554 --> 00:42:48,046
* Take you to court and sequester *

1110
00:42:48,124 --> 00:42:50,059
- Yeah!
- * I'm judge and the jury *

1111
00:42:50,127 --> 00:42:51,824
- Bruce Lee, Fists of Fury.
- (gunshot)

1112
00:42:51,898 --> 00:42:54,095
* You want to whip me,
the L-E-S-T-E-R *

1113
00:42:54,169 --> 00:42:55,831
(gunshot)

1114
00:42:55,905 --> 00:42:56,804
* Grab my girl by the waist *

1115
00:42:56,873 --> 00:42:58,171
* Slap my girl in the face *

1116
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,439
* When my mama died,
I moved inside her crib *

1117
00:43:00,513 --> 00:43:03,313
Hey, hey. Les, Les.

1118
00:43:03,385 --> 00:43:05,287
Hey, man, what you doing in here?

1119
00:43:05,356 --> 00:43:07,519
- (record scratches)
- We're here trying to make some music.

1120
00:43:07,593 --> 00:43:10,086
That what y'all doing?

1121
00:43:10,164 --> 00:43:11,359
I don't see no musicians.

1122
00:43:11,433 --> 00:43:13,801
(Floyd)
Listen, you know who played the base line

1123
00:43:13,871 --> 00:43:16,535
on that stuff you got running
under those so-called lyrics?

1124
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:19,240
My man, right there.

1125
00:43:19,315 --> 00:43:20,647
(laughing)

1126
00:43:20,717 --> 00:43:22,015
Yeah, right, man.

1127
00:43:22,086 --> 00:43:25,616
He ain't no damn instrumentator.

1128
00:43:25,693 --> 00:43:27,321
Hey, yo, Big L, check it out, man.
It's them, man.

1129
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:28,592
They ain't bullshitting.

1130
00:43:28,666 --> 00:43:29,929
Let me see this here.

1131
00:43:30,001 --> 00:43:32,301
(Lester)
The Real Deal, huh?

1132
00:43:32,372 --> 00:43:35,070
Hey, I mean, so what if we
jacked your shit, man? Huh?

1133
00:43:35,144 --> 00:43:37,580
Good artists borrow,

1134
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:39,481
great artists steal, man.

1135
00:43:39,552 --> 00:43:42,022
- You know who said that?
- Pablo Picasso.

1136
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:45,220
But literary scholars sometimes
like to attribute it to T.S. Eliot.

1137
00:43:45,296 --> 00:43:48,699
Hell, no. It wasn't no damn
Missy Elliot, man.

1138
00:43:48,768 --> 00:43:51,000
No, man, it was Bay Bay and them.

1139
00:43:51,073 --> 00:43:52,200
Bay Bay, yup.

1140
00:43:52,275 --> 00:43:54,575
That was Bay Bay,
for sure, hey, Bay Bay.

1141
00:43:54,646 --> 00:43:55,671
Look, man.

1142
00:43:55,748 --> 00:43:57,411
You know what? I'm sorry.

1143
00:43:57,485 --> 00:43:59,545
I shouldn't have sampled
your music without permission.

1144
00:43:59,622 --> 00:44:01,887
Why don't we all do a song together?

1145
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:04,430
A song called "Fuck You
and Your Bass Line."

1146
00:44:04,498 --> 00:44:06,262
That's what I feel about it.

1147
00:44:06,334 --> 00:44:08,270
Here what I think
about your damn bassline.

1148
00:44:08,338 --> 00:44:10,934
Henderson and Hinds!

1149
00:44:11,009 --> 00:44:12,034
Take that shit with you.

1150
00:44:12,112 --> 00:44:13,705
Gold-faced motherfucker.

1151
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:14,908
I made that shit gangster,
that's what I did.

1152
00:44:14,983 --> 00:44:16,384
Let me tell you something,
man, you...

1153
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:18,581
(Cleo)
Hey! Stop it!

1154
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,150
(all yelling)

1155
00:44:21,229 --> 00:44:22,458
Stop it!

1156
00:44:22,531 --> 00:44:24,227
Hey! This is my house.
You hear me?

1157
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,666
I don't need this shit right now.

1158
00:44:25,736 --> 00:44:27,797
You gonna talk to me crazy
in front of my boys?

1159
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:30,106
Why you still talking?
Shut the fuck up!

1160
00:44:30,178 --> 00:44:32,580
Pay-Pay and Zig-Zig,

1161
00:44:32,649 --> 00:44:34,676
let's dip, man.

1162
00:44:37,224 --> 00:44:38,556
Bye, old niggers.

1163
00:44:38,627 --> 00:44:42,122
Feel free to utilize
my facilities while you're here

1164
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,498
to make yourself another hit.

1165
00:44:43,569 --> 00:44:47,008
I know you ain't had a hit
since lke hit Tina.

1166
00:44:47,075 --> 00:44:48,043
Get out of here.

1167
00:44:48,111 --> 00:44:51,174
* Get the fuck *

1168
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,516
* Out my grill *

1169
00:44:53,588 --> 00:44:55,990
* 'Fore you get killed *

1170
00:44:56,059 --> 00:44:58,757
My name is Lester the Court Jester.

1171
00:44:58,831 --> 00:45:01,700
What a disrespectful son of a bitch.

1172
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:04,171
- Just lay off.
- Just lay off?

1173
00:45:04,241 --> 00:45:05,869
I know your mama taught you better.

1174
00:45:05,944 --> 00:45:07,412
Odetta would've
whooped his damn ass.

1175
00:45:07,479 --> 00:45:09,813
The fuck you know about
what my mama would've done.

1176
00:45:09,884 --> 00:45:12,218
Were you here when she was
dying of that cancer?

1177
00:45:12,288 --> 00:45:14,724
I don't think so. I think Lester was.
The hell you know.

1178
00:45:14,793 --> 00:45:16,056
You're right. I don't know nothing.

1179
00:45:16,128 --> 00:45:17,529
That's right, he don't know shit.

1180
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,363
No, he don't.

1181
00:45:19,435 --> 00:45:22,236
Now I'm going to go change
and get dinner started

1182
00:45:22,307 --> 00:45:23,900
because you guys
are staying, right?

1183
00:45:23,977 --> 00:45:25,104
Oh, no. We need to hit the road.

1184
00:45:25,179 --> 00:45:27,240
Yes, ma'am. We are staying.

1185
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,583
Okay, then.

1186
00:45:31,925 --> 00:45:34,225
Hell, it's what Mama would've wanted.

1187
00:45:34,296 --> 00:45:37,392
Oh, yeah. That's Odetta's
child, all right.

1188
00:45:43,947 --> 00:45:48,250
Okay, I put some sheets on the bed
in the guest room for you guys.

1189
00:45:48,321 --> 00:45:50,553
Thank you.

1190
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:52,754
That's Carla Thomas, right?

1191
00:45:52,829 --> 00:45:55,425
Sure is. Your mother's favorite.

1192
00:45:57,138 --> 00:46:00,200
So how come you guys only
put out that one album?

1193
00:46:02,213 --> 00:46:04,149
Well, when we wasn't
fighting over your mother,

1194
00:46:04,217 --> 00:46:05,480
we had a problem
in our record sales.

1195
00:46:05,553 --> 00:46:07,522
Yeah, as in we didn't sell any.

1196
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:08,750
Okay.

1197
00:46:08,826 --> 00:46:10,419
(men's voices)

1198
00:46:10,495 --> 00:46:13,695
(Cleo)
Well, you'd never know it wasn't a hit,

1199
00:46:13,768 --> 00:46:15,794
as much as Mama played it.

1200
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:17,864
(chatter)

1201
00:46:20,881 --> 00:46:23,716
About 100 degrees, and you
got a leather jacket on.

1202
00:46:23,786 --> 00:46:25,049
Appreciate it, Sam.

1203
00:46:25,122 --> 00:46:26,556
(laughing)

1204
00:46:26,624 --> 00:46:28,787
She said,

1205
00:46:28,862 --> 00:46:30,525
being on the road with y'all

1206
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:33,866
was some of the best times of her life.

1207
00:46:33,939 --> 00:46:37,571
Oh, good days. Good days.

1208
00:46:37,645 --> 00:46:40,241
I wish I could've seen that.

1209
00:46:40,317 --> 00:46:44,552
Say, why don't you
come to Memphis with us?

1210
00:46:44,624 --> 00:46:46,753
- Memphis?
- Yeah.

1211
00:46:46,828 --> 00:46:48,764
- What?
- We got a gig.

1212
00:46:48,832 --> 00:46:49,925
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Floyd, Floyd.

1213
00:46:50,001 --> 00:46:51,094
The girl got a life.

1214
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:52,263
She ain't got time to be ripping,

1215
00:46:52,339 --> 00:46:53,773
running up and down the road
with two old niggers.

1216
00:46:53,841 --> 00:46:55,309
Why not?

1217
00:46:55,377 --> 00:46:57,940
Memphis is fun.
We always have fun in Memphis.

1218
00:46:58,016 --> 00:46:59,109
You'll enjoy it. Trust me.

1219
00:46:59,185 --> 00:47:02,817
Fun? Look like I got time for fun?

1220
00:47:03,994 --> 00:47:05,155
Nah.

1221
00:47:13,445 --> 00:47:14,913
Hey, Louis.

1222
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:18,042
You know, Cleo was telling me

1223
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,146
that Odetta never told her nothing
about her father,

1224
00:47:20,223 --> 00:47:22,489
not even his name.

1225
00:47:22,561 --> 00:47:24,326
But she did say
he was a musician.

1226
00:47:24,398 --> 00:47:25,923
You ain't said nothing stupid
to the girl, have you?

1227
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,093
Like what?

1228
00:47:27,169 --> 00:47:29,969
Oh, like, uh,

1229
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:31,271
Cleo, you know, I'm your daddy.

1230
00:47:31,344 --> 00:47:34,008
Well, I'm still
feeling out the situation.

1231
00:47:34,082 --> 00:47:35,345
What the fuck was that

1232
00:47:35,418 --> 00:47:37,046
that "You ought to come
to Memphis with us" shit?

1233
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:40,457
Now that, right there,
that's a recipe for disaster.

1234
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:43,795
Louis, Louis, I know
this ain't easy for you.

1235
00:47:43,867 --> 00:47:46,337
But I never thought I'd have a child.

1236
00:47:46,404 --> 00:47:48,203
Now I'm part of this big
old circle called life.

1237
00:47:48,275 --> 00:47:53,273
A piece of Floyd Henderson,
man, might be here to live on,

1238
00:47:53,351 --> 00:47:54,785
and maybe forever.

1239
00:47:54,853 --> 00:47:56,720
If you don't shut up
and go to sleep,

1240
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:00,160
a big piece of Floyd Henderson ass
might not wake up in the morning.

1241
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:01,994
Oh, Louis, Louis.

1242
00:48:02,066 --> 00:48:03,626
I respect the fact that you want

1243
00:48:03,703 --> 00:48:06,105
to cloak your pain with your anger.

1244
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:08,269
(laughing)

1245
00:48:11,217 --> 00:48:13,380
Good night.

1246
00:48:13,454 --> 00:48:15,013
- (grunting)
- Good night.

1247
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:21,859
(Floyd yawning)

1248
00:48:21,937 --> 00:48:23,838
Oh, hey! What the fuck is that?

1249
00:48:23,907 --> 00:48:24,965
What's wrong?

1250
00:48:25,042 --> 00:48:26,636
You been taking
them dick pills again?

1251
00:48:26,712 --> 00:48:29,080
I though it was my cholesterol meds,
I swear I did.

1252
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:31,416
You can't be spooning
with a motherfucker with that!

1253
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,648
What's wrong with you?

1254
00:48:32,723 --> 00:48:35,250
- Uh, l...
- Nasty son of a bitch!

1255
00:48:35,328 --> 00:48:36,819
Give me some covers.
I'm gonna sleep on the floor.

1256
00:48:36,897 --> 00:48:37,956
Shit.

1257
00:48:38,032 --> 00:48:39,558
Go on, then. Sleep on the floor.

1258
00:48:39,636 --> 00:48:40,695
Nobody wants you, Louis.

1259
00:48:40,771 --> 00:48:42,672
I don't like boy pussy no way.

1260
00:48:42,741 --> 00:48:44,210
I hope your back hurt
like a motherfucker.

1261
00:48:44,278 --> 00:48:46,714
Better my back than my asshole.

1262
00:48:46,782 --> 00:48:48,876
Nasty... I'll beat
your motherfucking...

1263
00:48:48,952 --> 00:48:50,854
All them years I spent in prison,

1264
00:48:50,923 --> 00:48:52,859
ain't nobody roll up on me like that.

1265
00:48:52,927 --> 00:48:54,520
I was going to ask you about that.

1266
00:48:54,596 --> 00:48:56,896
You ought to be ashamed
of your goddamn self,

1267
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:58,401
nasty son of a bitch.

Mr. Henderson. Mr. Henderson?

1286

No, this is Louis.

1287
00:50:43,429 --> 00:50:45,092
Mr. Hinds.

1288
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:46,896
It's Phillip Newman
of FC Management.

1289
00:50:46,969 --> 00:50:48,632
How are you, man? I'm a huge fan.

1290
00:50:48,706 --> 00:50:50,140
So?

1291
00:50:50,209 --> 00:50:52,406
So...

1292
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,510
I think I've solved your
cash flow problems, my man.

1293
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:59,057
I've withdrawn $10,000

1294
00:50:59,124 --> 00:51:00,616
from my old parents' savings account

1295
00:51:00,695 --> 00:51:02,857
to tide you over until
things get sorted out.

1296
00:51:02,932 --> 00:51:04,161
Who'd you say you was again?

1297
00:51:04,235 --> 00:51:05,328
Phillip.

1298
00:51:05,403 --> 00:51:06,928
I wrote you letters
when the man had you

1299
00:51:07,006 --> 00:51:08,804
locked down in the pen, you know?

1300
00:51:08,876 --> 00:51:11,244
I know you're innocent.
Shit ain't right.

1301
00:51:12,249 --> 00:51:15,221
Okay, Phillip, um, look here.

1302
00:51:15,288 --> 00:51:16,313
We're on our way to Memphis.

1303
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:18,450
Um, why don't you meet us

1304
00:51:18,528 --> 00:51:21,761
at, um, the fountain at Peabody Hotel,

1305
00:51:21,833 --> 00:51:24,133
5:00?

1306
00:51:24,204 --> 00:51:27,074
Memphis. All right!

1307
00:51:28,245 --> 00:51:29,804
I'm hungrier than a mo...

1308
00:51:29,881 --> 00:51:32,317
There you are, girl.
You make up your mind?

1309
00:51:32,386 --> 00:51:33,877
You want to go to Memphis
with us, or not?

1310
00:51:33,955 --> 00:51:35,515
What you gonna do?

1311
00:51:38,196 --> 00:51:39,789
What happened?

1312
00:51:40,801 --> 00:51:43,135
Nothing. Nothing happened.

1313
00:51:44,474 --> 00:51:46,376
Nothing happened.

1314
00:51:48,382 --> 00:51:49,714
- No.
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.

1315
00:51:49,785 --> 00:51:51,276
Let him get his whupping.

00:51:53,023 --> 00:51:55,289
(cartoon on TV)

1318
00:52:02,307 --> 00:52:03,798
Why you hit her?

1319
00:52:03,876 --> 00:52:07,280
The hell you gonna
do about it, man?

1320
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:09,149
I'm the nigger with the gun, man.

1321
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:10,313
Oh, shit.

1322
00:52:10,389 --> 00:52:13,155
Damn! Ugh!

1323
00:52:13,227 --> 00:52:14,320
- Aah!
- Come on.

1324
00:52:14,396 --> 00:52:18,130
Get your albino
lke Turner ass up, uh-huh.

1325
00:52:18,203 --> 00:52:19,467
Come on.

1326
00:52:19,539 --> 00:52:22,635
Aah! Okay! Oh, shit! Aah!

1327
00:52:22,711 --> 00:52:24,237
My follicles, man!

1328
00:52:24,315 --> 00:52:27,286
Look her in the eye and say
"I'm sorry I hit you,

1329
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:28,844
and I'm never gonna put
my hands on you again."

1330
00:52:28,922 --> 00:52:31,553
- My bad, baby. I ain't...
- Say what I told you to say!

1331
00:52:31,628 --> 00:52:33,962
I'm sorry I hit you.
I ain't never gonna do it again.

1332
00:52:34,033 --> 00:52:36,595
Now, say you're sorry
for sampling my bass line

1333
00:52:36,671 --> 00:52:38,868
and for stomping
on my partner's record.

1334
00:52:38,941 --> 00:52:41,537
I'm sorry for sampling your bass line

1335
00:52:41,613 --> 00:52:44,277
- and stomping on your Real Deal record.
- Okay.

1336
00:52:44,351 --> 00:52:46,184
Now, we taking a road trip,
and we need some gas money.

1337
00:52:46,255 --> 00:52:48,019
I ain't got no money, man!

1338
00:52:48,091 --> 00:52:50,527
Can you help us?
I saw you out there selling that shit.

1339
00:52:50,596 --> 00:52:52,224
It's weed, it ain't crack man!
I ain't got...

1340
00:52:52,299 --> 00:52:54,132
- (Louis) Give me the money!
- Okay, okay.

1341
00:52:54,203 --> 00:52:55,466
There's money in my shorts...

1342
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:57,030
Ain't nobody reaching
in your drawers, get it out!

1343
00:52:57,108 --> 00:52:58,736
Okay, okay.

1344
00:52:58,811 --> 00:53:02,181
I got to reach around my meat, man.

1345
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:03,479
(whimpering)

1346
00:53:03,553 --> 00:53:05,489
- Here.
- Take it.

1347
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,253
Take it.

1348
00:53:08,295 --> 00:53:10,458
Oh, damn. My hair hurts.

1349
00:53:10,532 --> 00:53:12,126
Take it, man! Aah!

1350
00:53:12,203 --> 00:53:13,135
(Lester)
Ow! You're breaking my arm!

1351
00:53:13,204 --> 00:53:14,503
Oh, hush.

1352
00:53:14,574 --> 00:53:16,600
That's just a little
Chinese submission hold.

1353
00:53:16,677 --> 00:53:18,977
This is what it feels like
when I break your arm.

1354
00:53:19,048 --> 00:53:20,311
- (bones cracking)
- (screaming)

1355
00:53:20,383 --> 00:53:22,285
- Shit!
- Break his arm.

1356
00:53:22,354 --> 00:53:24,847
(screaming)
Oh, bastard!

1357
00:53:24,925 --> 00:53:27,020
I know motherfuckers like you, Lester.

1358
00:53:27,096 --> 00:53:29,328
Used to see them
in the yard every day.

1359
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,566
You'd better hope
you don't never go inside

1360
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,101
because you,
you straight up bitch material.

1361
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,580
What about my car, man?

1362
00:53:37,649 --> 00:53:38,776
What about your car?

1363
00:53:38,851 --> 00:53:40,821
Oh, shit.

1364
00:53:40,889 --> 00:53:42,016
I ain't got no clothes on.

1365
00:53:42,091 --> 00:53:43,457
This is bullshit.

1366
00:53:43,527 --> 00:53:45,257
So what? You run around
with your drawers

1367
00:53:45,329 --> 00:53:46,695
hanging off your ass anyway.

1368
00:53:46,766 --> 00:53:48,894
I wasn't really gonna shoot you!

1369
00:53:48,969 --> 00:53:50,062
Get the fuck out of here.

1370
00:53:50,138 --> 00:53:52,131
See, I'm the nigger
with the gun now.

1371
00:53:52,209 --> 00:53:54,202
You better hope my arm
don't get better.

1372
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,477
I'm gonna learn karate
and kick your ass!

1373
00:53:56,551 --> 00:53:58,019
Fuck you!

1374
00:54:00,457 --> 00:54:01,891
It was a good thing you stepped in

1375
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,520
when you did what you did, partner,

1376
00:54:03,597 --> 00:54:05,031
because if I'd have
got a piece of him,

1377
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:07,797
I'd have fucked his shit up
entirely, and you know that.

1378
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,134
Come on.

1379
00:54:09,207 --> 00:54:11,006
I'm too old to be tussling
with the motherf...

1380
00:54:11,077 --> 00:54:13,104
I'd have shot him. I'd have popped...

1381
00:54:13,181 --> 00:54:15,708
I'm six, seven years older.
I'd have, like, tussled...

1382
00:54:18,824 --> 00:54:20,087

1387
00:54:28,275 --> 00:54:29,709
They're back in Memphis tonight

1388
00:54:29,778 --> 00:54:31,770
performing at the House of Soul.

1389
00:54:31,848 --> 00:54:33,943

The Orpheum Theatre!

1398
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:57,652
Our show's up in there.

1400
00:55:02,037 --> 00:55:05,134

1405
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,953
Oh, my God.

1406
00:55:17,031 --> 00:55:18,795
Mr. Henderson, Mr. Hinds,

1407
00:55:18,868 --> 00:55:20,097
let me just start off by saying...

1408
00:55:20,171 --> 00:55:21,469
Thank you.

1409
00:55:25,513 --> 00:55:26,776
What's up?

1410
00:55:26,849 --> 00:55:29,582
Phillip, tonight we're
playing at the House of Soul.

1411
00:55:29,655 --> 00:55:30,987
Make sure you be there, baby.

1412
00:55:31,057 --> 00:55:33,994
Right on.

1413
00:55:34,062 --> 00:55:36,761
Hello. Welcome to the Peabody.
How can I help you?

1414
00:55:36,835 --> 00:55:39,271
You can help me by giving me

1415
00:55:39,339 --> 00:55:41,001
three of your best
doggone suites, baby.

1416
00:55:41,075 --> 00:55:44,013
Well, it'll be my pleasure
to assist you today.

1417
00:55:44,081 --> 00:55:45,208
May I see some identification, please?

1418
00:55:45,283 --> 00:55:46,444
Okay.

1419
00:55:46,519 --> 00:55:47,953
Right there.

1420
00:55:48,022 --> 00:55:49,513
- (laughing)
- Go to hell, Louis.

1421
00:55:49,591 --> 00:55:52,563
Mr. Henderson?

1422
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:54,098
It is I.

1423
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:57,196
(alarm beeping)

1424
00:56:00,377 --> 00:56:02,472
Will you excuse me
for just a minute, please?

1425
00:56:02,548 --> 00:56:03,709
Okay.

1426
00:56:05,053 --> 00:56:07,148
(Woman)
Henderson.

1427
00:56:07,223 --> 00:56:10,389
Ahh, I-I'm sorry,
Mr. Henderson, Henderson.

1428
00:56:10,463 --> 00:56:12,261
We're unable to accommodate you.

1429
00:56:12,332 --> 00:56:14,359
Perhaps we could
recommend another hotel.

1430
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:16,030
For what, man? I'm in Memphis.

1431
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:17,439
I want to stay at the Peabody.

1432
00:56:17,509 --> 00:56:20,071
Yes, sir, I understand
you've stayed with us before,

1433
00:56:20,147 --> 00:56:21,547
and apparently,
that's the problem.

1434
00:56:21,616 --> 00:56:23,882
It seems that the last time
you stayed here...

1435
00:56:23,954 --> 00:56:27,120
March 12, 1978, to be exact...

1436
00:56:27,194 --> 00:56:30,165
you hosted a party,
during which the room

1437
00:56:30,232 --> 00:56:32,099
and several other areas of the hotel

1438
00:56:32,169 --> 00:56:34,503
- sustained extensive damage.
- Uh-oh.

1439
00:56:34,574 --> 00:56:36,737
I don't recollect nothing like that.

1440
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:38,677
I think that's the night
Sly and Bootsy

1441
00:56:38,747 --> 00:56:40,307
came by with the fire-eater.

1442
00:56:40,384 --> 00:56:42,718
Is that the one with the snake?

1443
00:56:42,789 --> 00:56:44,724
- That's the one.
- Hmm.

1444
00:56:44,792 --> 00:56:48,458
Perhaps you could put those rooms
in the name of Louis Hinds.

1445
00:56:48,533 --> 00:56:49,796
Yeah, perhaps.

1446
00:56:49,869 --> 00:56:51,895
Louis Hinds, we'll try that.

1447
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,945
(alarm beeping)

1448
00:56:59,386 --> 00:57:01,321
I'm sorry you had
to see that, Linda.

1449
00:57:01,389 --> 00:57:03,120
What's on there?
Let me see that shit.

1450
00:57:03,193 --> 00:57:05,322
I want to see what's on there.

1451
00:57:05,397 --> 00:57:08,197
I need four rooms, Don.

1452
00:57:08,269 --> 00:57:10,205
Your best available.

1453
00:57:11,241 --> 00:57:13,677
(laughing)

1454
00:57:14,881 --> 00:57:17,043
** (new age)

1455
00:57:23,363 --> 00:57:26,232
(door opening)

1456
00:57:26,302 --> 00:57:27,793
Oh, hey, guys.

1457
00:57:27,871 --> 00:57:29,966
Your tailor gave me
several choices for tonight.

1458
00:57:30,042 --> 00:57:32,012
He said he's going
to stop by around 7:30.

1459
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:33,138
What the fuck?

1460
00:57:33,215 --> 00:57:34,911
Did you catch the sale
over at the Build-A-Pimp?

1461
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:37,147
You like that? It's fly, huh?

1462
00:57:37,222 --> 00:57:39,852
It's a get-down, get-down.
It's live. It's funky.

1463
00:57:39,927 --> 00:57:41,520
And I think I'm going
to get some poonanny.

1464
00:57:41,597 --> 00:57:43,088
To be honest with you,

1465
00:57:43,166 --> 00:57:45,534
I haven't been laid
since Friends was on television.

1466
00:57:45,604 --> 00:57:46,867
So this is my night.

1467
00:57:46,939 --> 00:57:49,502
You sure that ain't
one of your children?

1468
00:57:49,578 --> 00:57:52,208
(chuckling)

1469
00:57:52,283 --> 00:57:53,546
(Floyd)
You gonna sing real nice tonight.

1470
00:57:53,619 --> 00:57:54,780
(Louis)
Who's the girl singer?

1471
00:57:54,854 --> 00:57:57,086
(Floyd laughing)

1472
00:57:58,261 --> 00:58:01,722
Oh, my goodness!
Look at here! Oh, man.

1473
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,927
Hello, Louis. Good to see you.

1474
00:58:03,003 --> 00:58:04,096
You good, man?

1475
00:58:11,285 --> 00:58:12,378
(Man)
Hey, good-looking.

1476
00:58:12,453 --> 00:58:14,946
Claudette.
How you doing, girl?

1477
00:58:15,025 --> 00:58:16,584
I know you still ain't upset

1478
00:58:16,661 --> 00:58:17,959
about what happened
in Baltimore that...

1479
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:20,057
Oh! What's wrong
with you, woman?

1480
00:58:20,134 --> 00:58:22,536
You going straight to hell, Floyd Henderson.

1481
00:58:24,074 --> 00:58:25,337
What you laughing at?

1482
00:58:25,411 --> 00:58:28,280
- You want some, too?
- No.

1483
00:58:28,349 --> 00:58:29,317
Fuck you.

1484
00:58:29,384 --> 00:58:30,943
Eee.

1485
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:32,683
* Fuck you, fuck you *

1486
00:58:32,757 --> 00:58:34,419
Now we have no girl singer.

1487
00:58:34,493 --> 00:58:36,429
We just got to find
a replacement, that's all.

1488
00:58:36,497 --> 00:58:37,658
It's too late.

1489
00:58:38,702 --> 00:58:39,965
Cleo.

1490
00:58:40,037 --> 00:58:41,835
You know all our songs, right?

1491
00:58:41,907 --> 00:58:44,811
Ho ho ho. No offense, man,

1492
00:58:44,879 --> 00:58:46,541
but I'm not playing
with no rank amateur.

1493
00:58:46,615 --> 00:58:48,949
Come on, Wolfman,
this ain't no rank amateur, man.

1494
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:50,683
This Odetta Whitfield's daughter, man.

1495
00:58:50,757 --> 00:58:51,884
Ain't got to recognize.

1496
00:58:51,959 --> 00:58:54,452
Shit. Let's roll, then, baby.

1497
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:56,123
Yeah.

1498
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:59,001
She can sing, can't she?

1499
00:59:00,775 --> 00:59:01,765
Ow!

1500
00:59:04,081 --> 00:59:05,447
Ow!

1501
00:59:07,254 --> 00:59:10,123
- Oh, oh!
- (crowd cheering)

1502
00:59:11,762 --> 00:59:13,254
(Floyd)
Here we go.

1503
00:59:13,332 --> 00:59:16,030
Oh, yeah.

1504
00:59:19,343 --> 00:59:22,747
* If music makes you move *

1505
00:59:22,816 --> 00:59:25,184
* You can really groove *

1506
00:59:25,254 --> 00:59:28,350
- * Groove on *
- (cheering)

1507
00:59:28,426 --> 00:59:31,728
* Groove on *

1508
00:59:31,799 --> 00:59:35,033
* If you feel like
you want to make love *

1509
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:37,837
* Under the stars above *

1510
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:39,846
* Love on *

1511
00:59:39,914 --> 00:59:41,678
(cheering)

1512
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:43,413
* Love on *

1513
00:59:45,056 --> 00:59:47,424
* If there's something
that you wanna say *

1514
00:59:47,494 --> 00:59:50,523
* And talking is the hard way *

1515
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,298
* Rap on *

1516
00:59:53,371 --> 00:59:57,471
- (cheering)
- * Rap on *

1517
00:59:57,546 --> 01:00:00,779
* 'Cause whatever *

1518
01:00:00,852 --> 01:00:02,549
* You want to do *

1519
01:00:02,622 --> 01:00:06,061
- * Ow *
- * You got to do your thing *

1520
01:00:06,128 --> 01:00:07,994
(cheering)

1521
01:00:11,438 --> 01:00:13,032
* If you feel like
you want to scream *

1522
01:00:13,108 --> 01:00:14,201
(crowd screaming)

1523
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,212
* If that's your way you let off steam *

1524
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,772
* Scream on *

1525
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:19,375
(screaming)

1526
01:00:19,453 --> 01:00:21,889
* Scream on *

1527
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:26,154
* If you feel like you want to sing *

1528
01:00:26,232 --> 01:00:29,067
* 'Cause singing is your thing *

1529
01:00:29,137 --> 01:00:31,107
* Sing on *

1530
01:00:32,977 --> 01:00:36,108
* Sing on *

1531
01:00:36,183 --> 01:00:38,813
* If you want to make love all night *

1532
01:00:38,888 --> 01:00:42,588
* 'Cause you feel it's right *

1533
01:00:42,662 --> 01:00:44,495
- * Right on *
- Oh, yeah, girl.

1534
01:00:44,566 --> 01:00:47,697
- (cheering)
- * Right on *

1535
01:00:47,772 --> 01:00:51,711
* 'Cause whatever *

1536
01:00:51,779 --> 01:00:54,716
* You want to do *

1537
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:56,777

1539
01:00:59,994 --> 01:01:02,294
(laughing)

1540
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:09,303
I'm with the band.
Yeah, it's a dream.

1541
01:01:09,378 --> 01:01:11,370
Yeah, it's a... it's a total dream.

1542
01:01:11,448 --> 01:01:12,541
Yeah.

1543
01:01:12,617 --> 01:01:14,985
I play the harmuffica.

1544
01:01:15,054 --> 01:01:16,956
* Wa, wa *

1545
01:01:17,025 --> 01:01:19,154
* Wa, wa *

1546
01:01:19,229 --> 01:01:20,492
I'll save you a seat.

1547
01:01:20,565 --> 01:01:23,799
* 'Cause whatever *

1548
01:01:23,871 --> 01:01:27,070
* You want to do *

1549
01:01:27,144 --> 01:01:31,516
* Yeah, baby, oh *

1550
01:01:31,585 --> 01:01:33,487
(cheering)

1551
01:01:33,555 --> 01:01:37,255
* You got to do your thing *

1552
01:01:37,329 --> 01:01:39,526
* Yeah *

1553
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:48,544
Yeah.

1554
01:01:50,286 --> 01:01:51,686
(cheering)

1555
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:56,558
(Cleo laughing)

1556
01:01:56,631 --> 01:02:00,161
This is the most insane
night of my life.

1557
01:02:00,237 --> 01:02:02,036
You know Isaac wants
to put me in his studio?

1558
01:02:02,108 --> 01:02:05,444
He says he's got a song
that'd be perfect for me.

1559
01:02:05,514 --> 01:02:07,483
Oh, he does, does he?

1560
01:02:07,551 --> 01:02:10,853
Uh... Come on, now. It ain't like that.

1561
01:02:10,924 --> 01:02:12,689
Oh, it's always like that,

1562
01:02:12,761 --> 01:02:14,252
like movies.

1563
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:15,696
(laughing)

1564
01:02:15,766 --> 01:02:18,202
Well, I'll be careful.

1565
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:21,003
Just trying to look out
for you, that's all.

1566
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:26,212
Thanks, guys, for everything.

1567
01:02:28,556 --> 01:02:32,393
* You got to do your thing, hey *

1568
01:02:32,463 --> 01:02:34,933
(laughing)
See you later.

1569
01:02:40,845 --> 01:02:43,338
* If you feel like making love *

1570
01:02:43,416 --> 01:02:45,909
* 'Cause that's your thing *

1571
01:02:45,988 --> 01:02:48,687
* Right on *

1572
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,162
Man, ain't that the Real Deal car?

1573
01:02:51,231 --> 01:02:53,360
Sure is, homie. You a fan?

1574
01:02:55,572 --> 01:02:58,976
Hell, yeah. I'm a big fan.

1575
01:02:59,045 --> 01:03:00,571
You know where they at?

1576
01:03:00,649 --> 01:03:02,083
'Cause I need to holler at 'em.

1577
01:03:02,151 --> 01:03:05,590
Actually, I'm their manager.

1578
01:03:05,658 --> 01:03:08,926
Really? Their manager?

1579
01:03:08,997 --> 01:03:10,761
(laughing)

1580
01:03:10,834 --> 01:03:14,068
(knocking)

1581
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:15,506
Hold on a minute.

1582
01:03:18,882 --> 01:03:20,909
- Oh, hi, Floyd.
- Hey.

1583
01:03:20,986 --> 01:03:23,046
Come on in.
Check this place out.

1584
01:03:23,123 --> 01:03:24,352
I could get used to this.

1585
01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:25,792
- I'll bet you could.
- (laughing)

1586
01:03:25,862 --> 01:03:27,023
Let me get you a drink.

1587
01:03:27,097 --> 01:03:28,224
Yeah, I'll take one.

1588
01:03:28,299 --> 01:03:29,562
But hold on, before you do that,

1589
01:03:29,635 --> 01:03:31,228
there's something
I want to say to you.

1590
01:03:31,304 --> 01:03:33,206
It's been a blast connecting with you.

1591
01:03:33,275 --> 01:03:34,538
I want you to know that.

1592
01:03:34,611 --> 01:03:36,045
That's sweet of you.

1593
01:03:36,113 --> 01:03:37,376
And if you need anything,

1594
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:38,645
like money or something like that,

1595
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:41,485
don't you hesitate to call me now.

1596
01:03:41,557 --> 01:03:43,618
Not that money gonna make up
for the lost time between us

1597
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:45,162
or nothing like that.

1598
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:46,493
Lost time?

1599
01:03:46,566 --> 01:03:47,591
You have to understand,

1600
01:03:47,668 --> 01:03:50,765
Odetta never told me
nothing about you.

1601
01:03:50,841 --> 01:03:52,605
Had I known about you
from the beginning,

1602
01:03:52,677 --> 01:03:53,940
- I'd have been here from the start.
- Whoa, whoa.

1603
01:03:54,013 --> 01:03:55,276
- Floyd...
- She never said nothing to me about you.

1604
01:03:55,348 --> 01:03:56,612
You're not my father, Floyd.

1605
01:03:56,685 --> 01:03:58,119
You're not listening.

1606
01:03:58,187 --> 01:03:59,780
See, the thing you...
what's that? Say what?

1607
01:03:59,857 --> 01:04:01,417
You're not my father.

1608
01:04:01,494 --> 01:04:03,224
I-I'm not?

1609
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:04,595
No.

1610
01:04:04,666 --> 01:04:06,260
How do you know?

1611
01:04:06,336 --> 01:04:08,636
Because he knows who I am

1612
01:04:08,707 --> 01:04:10,198
Or he did.

1613
01:04:10,276 --> 01:04:11,539
I mean, for all I know,

1614
01:04:11,612 --> 01:04:12,841
he could be dead.

1615
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:17,255
I get a little money from him
every once in a while.

1616
01:04:17,323 --> 01:04:20,055
It's a blind trust he set up years ago.

1617
01:04:20,127 --> 01:04:22,256
Something to do
with his music royalties.

1618
01:04:22,332 --> 01:04:25,064
Music royalties?

1619
01:04:26,072 --> 01:04:27,974
(banging)

1620
01:04:28,042 --> 01:04:29,840
Oh!

1621
01:04:29,912 --> 01:04:31,814
You knocked up my wife, motherfucker.

1622
01:04:31,882 --> 01:04:35,013
Ooh. You stole her from me first.

1623
01:04:35,089 --> 01:04:36,955
What is wrong with you?

1624
01:04:37,025 --> 01:04:38,551
Whoo!

1625
01:04:38,628 --> 01:04:39,960
You lost your...

1626
01:04:40,031 --> 01:04:41,465
You didn't tell Cleo, did you?

1627
01:04:41,533 --> 01:04:42,967
No, I didn't tell her.

1628
01:04:43,036 --> 01:04:44,368
I should've told her, though.

1629
01:04:44,439 --> 01:04:46,704
I'll bet you laughing
your ass off, wasn't you?

1630
01:04:46,776 --> 01:04:48,245
Going around, talking
about I'm the girl's daddy

1631
01:04:48,313 --> 01:04:51,148
and big round circle of life,
all that bullshit.

1632
01:04:51,218 --> 01:04:52,652
Giggle, giggle, motherfucker.

1633
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,383
Well, just a little bit.

1634
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:56,255
(grunting)

1635
01:04:56,327 --> 01:04:57,660
Floyd...

1636
01:04:57,730 --> 01:04:59,494
Look, Floyd...

1637
01:04:59,566 --> 01:05:00,761
Floyd, put it down. Put it down!

1638
01:05:00,835 --> 01:05:03,431
Dawg, come on!

1639
01:05:03,507 --> 01:05:05,101
You need to quit before you get hurt.

1640
01:05:05,177 --> 01:05:08,171
Oh! Oh! Whoa! Oh!

1641
01:05:08,249 --> 01:05:09,274
- Ugh!
- (clatter)

1642
01:05:09,351 --> 01:05:10,786
Look, Floyd,

1643
01:05:10,854 --> 01:05:12,789
I didn't mean for it
to happen, all right?

1644
01:05:12,857 --> 01:05:14,155
You know how she was.

1645
01:05:14,226 --> 01:05:15,285
Come here.

1646
01:05:15,362 --> 01:05:17,559
Come here.

1647
01:05:17,633 --> 01:05:19,193
Come on, man. Stop acting a fool.

1648
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:20,533
(grunting)

1649
01:05:20,605 --> 01:05:21,664
You all right?

1650
01:05:21,741 --> 01:05:23,676
Aw, shit. Quit acting a fool!

1651
01:05:25,214 --> 01:05:26,443
(screaming)

1652
01:05:26,516 --> 01:05:30,080
- (gagging)
- Fucking dad!

1653
01:05:30,156 --> 01:05:32,718
(wailing)
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1654
01:05:32,794 --> 01:05:35,492
(screaming)

1655
01:05:35,566 --> 01:05:37,968
(laughing)

1656
01:05:39,574 --> 01:05:42,272
(Floyd screaming)

1657
01:05:45,885 --> 01:05:48,117
(screaming)

1658
01:05:51,061 --> 01:05:53,463
(whimpering)

1659
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:54,830
Time out.

1660
01:05:54,901 --> 01:05:57,133
Time out.

1661
01:05:57,205 --> 01:05:59,802
Oh.
(inhaler discharges)

1662
01:06:01,013 --> 01:06:03,347
Still got a little pop
in your punch there, partner.

1663
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:05,545
Pop this, motherfucker!

1664
01:06:05,621 --> 01:06:07,386
Oh!

1665
01:06:07,458 --> 01:06:08,790
Ooh.

1666
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:10,796
Shit. Ugh.

1667
01:06:10,864 --> 01:06:12,127
You dirty motherfucker,

1668
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,102
hitting me in the nuts.

1669
01:06:14,171 --> 01:06:16,471
Ooh! Shit.

1670
01:06:16,542 --> 01:06:20,413
Louis, you just can't
keep whooping on my ass.

1671
01:06:20,482 --> 01:06:22,577
I'm a motherfucking man, baby.

1672
01:06:22,653 --> 01:06:24,178
I'm a motherfucking man.

1673
01:06:24,255 --> 01:06:27,227
(both whimpering)

1674
01:06:27,295 --> 01:06:30,391
Louis, how come you won't
see your own daughter?

1675
01:06:30,466 --> 01:06:32,459
Oh, motherfucker,
I wanted to see her,

1676
01:06:32,537 --> 01:06:35,030
but, you know...

1677
01:06:35,108 --> 01:06:38,012
It's time... After a while,

1678
01:06:38,081 --> 01:06:41,109
you know, it's just...
it's just too much.

1679
01:06:41,186 --> 01:06:42,951
Why didn't O tell her?

1680
01:06:43,023 --> 01:06:44,616
Why didn't Odetta tell her, man?

1681
01:06:44,693 --> 01:06:46,629
What was she going to tell her, huh?

1682
01:06:46,697 --> 01:06:50,397
That her daddy was
a alcoholic dopehead convict

1683
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:52,804
that fucked up everything
he touched, hmm?

1684
01:06:52,874 --> 01:06:53,967
No, no.

1685
01:06:54,043 --> 01:06:55,875
She was better off without me.

1686
01:06:55,947 --> 01:06:57,415
Oh, shit.

1687
01:06:57,483 --> 01:06:58,542
Anyhow, it's too late now.

1688
01:06:58,619 --> 01:06:59,644
Uh-uh.

1689
01:06:59,721 --> 01:07:02,214
It was a mistake
getting to know her.

1690
01:07:02,292 --> 01:07:03,954
- Lou...
- What?

1691
01:07:04,028 --> 01:07:05,394
What is wrong with you?
You having a seizure?

1692
01:07:05,464 --> 01:07:07,764
What? What?

1693
01:07:07,835 --> 01:07:09,600
Oh.

1694
01:07:09,672 --> 01:07:11,608
Oh. Cleo.

1695
01:07:11,676 --> 01:07:13,474
- Cleo, wait. Ow!
- Excuse me.

1696
01:07:13,545 --> 01:07:15,515
God damn it. Wait!

1697
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,074
Let me talk to... ow!

1698
01:07:17,152 --> 01:07:18,450
Move, God damn it!

1699
01:07:18,521 --> 01:07:20,150
Come here, Cleo!

1700
01:07:20,225 --> 01:07:22,091
Call the police.

1701
01:07:24,232 --> 01:07:25,427
Hey, yo, white boy.

1702
01:07:25,501 --> 01:07:27,528
You really
in the music business?

1703
01:07:27,605 --> 01:07:28,698
Why, do you have a mix tape?

1704
01:07:28,774 --> 01:07:30,265
Shut the fuck up, white boy!

1705
01:07:30,343 --> 01:07:32,677
And stop sweating
so goddamn much.

1706
01:07:32,747 --> 01:07:34,273
You smell like bacon.

1707
01:07:34,351 --> 01:07:36,286
And I'm a Muslim on Saturdays.

1708
01:07:36,354 --> 01:07:38,347
Fucking wrong with you, huh?

1709
01:07:38,425 --> 01:07:40,554
How you white and got a afro?

1710
01:07:40,629 --> 01:07:42,656
That ain't cool.

1711
01:07:42,733 --> 01:07:43,996
Damn, my head hurt!

1712
01:07:44,069 --> 01:07:46,403
Hey, there go Cleo.
There go Cleo.

1713
01:07:46,473 --> 01:07:48,271
Taxi.

1714
01:07:48,343 --> 01:07:49,869
(Lester)
There go my baby, right there.

1715
01:07:49,946 --> 01:07:51,380
Where she going?

1716
01:07:51,449 --> 01:07:52,712
(Man)
Where to, honey?

1717
01:07:52,784 --> 01:07:54,082
Cleo!

1718
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:55,416
Oh, hell, yeah.

1719
01:07:55,489 --> 01:07:58,928
There go that old
Snoop Dogg-looking motherfucker.

1720
01:07:58,995 --> 01:08:00,054
Real Deal,

1721
01:08:00,131 --> 01:08:02,601
they fitting to be real dead!

1722
01:08:02,669 --> 01:08:04,298
I'm coming for you, old man!

1723
01:08:04,373 --> 01:08:06,467
Hey, yo, Les, let them old
motherfuckers have it, man.

1724
01:08:06,543 --> 01:08:07,875
- I'm going for it.
- Go for it, nigger.

1725
01:08:07,946 --> 01:08:10,006
Get them motherfuckers.

1726
01:08:10,083 --> 01:08:11,779
Hey, hey, hey.

1727
01:08:11,853 --> 01:08:14,016
Come on, now. You know
I'm the only who drive the Mothership, man.

1728
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,558
Watch this shit with Lester

1729
01:08:15,626 --> 01:08:16,889
about to kill
on these motherfuckers.

1730
01:08:16,962 --> 01:08:18,556
That's how we live,
we do it like that.

1731
01:08:18,632 --> 01:08:20,396
(horn honking)

1732
01:08:20,468 --> 01:08:21,834
(Phillip)
Louis!

1733
01:08:21,904 --> 01:08:23,931
I'm back!

1734
01:08:24,008 --> 01:08:26,205
Gun!

1735
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:27,372
Yeah!

1736
01:08:29,419 --> 01:08:30,887
(screaming)

1737
01:08:30,954 --> 01:08:34,120
Oh, shit! Motherfucking
Lester got fucked up!

1738
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:35,253
God damn!

1739
01:08:35,329 --> 01:08:36,854
(Lester screaming)

1740
01:08:36,932 --> 01:08:38,868
I'm out of this motherfucker...

1741
01:08:38,936 --> 01:08:40,199
- What about Lester, man?
- Fuck Lester.

1742
01:08:40,272 --> 01:08:42,970
Yeah, fuck Lester!

1743
01:08:43,043 --> 01:08:46,607
You don't even know Lester, man.

1744
01:08:46,683 --> 01:08:49,415
(screaming)

1745
01:08:49,488 --> 01:08:51,082
Why you run over me, man!

1746
01:08:51,158 --> 01:08:55,154
You old dirty bastard!

1747
01:08:55,232 --> 01:08:56,598
(grunt)

1748
01:08:56,668 --> 01:08:59,504
Old Jim Brown, Fred Williamson,

1749
01:08:59,574 --> 01:09:02,238
two-the-hard-way motherfuckers!

1750
01:09:02,312 --> 01:09:04,441
I'll kill you, I swear...

1751
01:09:04,516 --> 01:09:07,043
Aah! Shit!

1752
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,615
Let me kill you one time at least, man!

1753
01:09:10,694 --> 01:09:12,060
You done fucked up the Mothership.

1754
01:09:12,129 --> 01:09:13,256
I ought to stab you in your throat.

1755
01:09:13,332 --> 01:09:14,459
Fuck you! Aah!

1756
01:09:14,534 --> 01:09:16,299
- (police siren)
- You hear that?

1757
01:09:16,371 --> 01:09:18,739
Shoot that motherfucker, Louis.

1758
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:23,111
Get your hands up!

1759
01:09:23,184 --> 01:09:25,984
I can't, nigger. My arm's in a brace.

1760
01:09:26,055 --> 01:09:28,821
Drop the weapon now!
Come on!

1761
01:09:34,471 --> 01:09:36,236
This is my first time ever being in here.

1762
01:09:36,308 --> 01:09:37,708
Quiet, please.

1763
01:09:43,655 --> 01:09:45,385
This filthy-ass motherfucking place,

1764
01:09:45,457 --> 01:09:47,017
man, got me itching.

1765
01:09:48,330 --> 01:09:50,664
Yo, turnkey!

1766
01:09:50,734 --> 01:09:52,430
Come on and let me out
of this motherfucker!

1767
01:09:52,504 --> 01:09:54,770
You might want to wrap
your mind around the fact

1768
01:09:54,841 --> 01:09:55,968
that we're gonna miss that show.

1769
01:09:56,044 --> 01:09:57,775
Fuck you talking about, man?

1770
01:09:57,847 --> 01:10:00,477
We gotta be in New York
tomorrow night.

1771
01:10:00,552 --> 01:10:02,316
Uh-uh. Not me.

1772
01:10:02,388 --> 01:10:03,617
I've had enough. I'm done.

1773
01:10:03,692 --> 01:10:05,718
What, you're walking
out on me, Louis?

1774
01:10:05,795 --> 01:10:08,095
Look, Floyd,
I was doing just fine

1775
01:10:08,166 --> 01:10:09,464
before you showed up at my door.

1776
01:10:09,535 --> 01:10:10,834
That's the thanks I get

1777
01:10:10,905 --> 01:10:12,373
for pulling you out
of that fucking rat hole.

1778
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:13,704
You was just sitting up in there,

1779
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:14,971
just sitting there waiting to die.

1780
01:10:15,045 --> 01:10:16,172
Negro, please.

1781
01:10:16,247 --> 01:10:17,840
You ain't no different from me,

1782
01:10:17,917 --> 01:10:20,548
Especially since your nephew
put your senile ass out to pasture

1783
01:10:20,623 --> 01:10:21,784
and stole your business.

1784
01:10:21,858 --> 01:10:23,690
Fuck you, Louis.

1785
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:26,824
Crawl back under that damn rock
you've been living.

1786
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,425
I don't need you.

1787
01:10:28,503 --> 01:10:30,530
I'll do this shit by my damn self.

1788
01:10:30,607 --> 01:10:34,102
Yo! Turnkey!

1789
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:35,945
Come on and let me
out of this motherfucker.

1790
01:10:36,018 --> 01:10:37,782
I've had enough, man.
I want my lawyer.

1791
01:10:37,854 --> 01:10:38,879
Relax, relax.

1792
01:10:38,956 --> 01:10:40,892
You ain't gonna need no lawyer.

1793
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,088
Witnesses say
your story checks out,

1794
01:10:43,164 --> 01:10:45,896
so you, sir, are good to go.

1795
01:10:46,937 --> 01:10:49,373
- Yeah.
- (groaning)

1796
01:10:49,442 --> 01:10:51,912
Whoa. Hold on there, Chuck Berry.

1797
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:54,212
You're gonna need a lawyer.

1798
01:10:54,284 --> 01:10:58,018
Seems crossing state lines
is in violation of his parole,

1799
01:10:58,091 --> 01:11:00,061
Not to mention
possession of firearms

1800
01:11:00,128 --> 01:11:01,426
and driving without a license.

1801
01:11:01,497 --> 01:11:02,556
No license?

1802
01:11:03,802 --> 01:11:05,065
Step back for a minute.

1803
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:09,242
I hope your ass rot up in here,

1804
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:11,281
you criminal-bound
motherfucker, you.

1805
01:11:11,348 --> 01:11:16,517
As Lao-Tzu says,
"Let things flow forward as they may."

1806
01:11:16,591 --> 01:11:18,925
And I'm gonna let it flow, too, baby.

1807
01:11:18,996 --> 01:11:23,197
And I got some Blackanese
philosophical shit for your ass, pal.

1808
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:25,763
You get by, Lou,
but you don't get away.

1809
01:11:25,842 --> 01:11:28,108
You sit in shit,
you start to smell like it,

1810
01:11:28,179 --> 01:11:29,738
so check the crack of your ass.

1811
01:11:29,816 --> 01:11:31,978
Here's something else for you.

1812
01:11:32,053 --> 01:11:34,182
Here go her number.

1813
01:11:35,226 --> 01:11:37,753
Call her... Daddy.

1814
01:11:39,434 --> 01:11:40,663
Fuck him, man!

1815
01:11:40,736 --> 01:11:42,500
Let's get on
out of this motherfucker.

1816
01:11:42,572 --> 01:11:44,906
He ain't worth
two damn flies smashed.

1817
01:11:47,214 --> 01:11:48,307
Nigger.

1818
01:11:55,763 --> 01:11:56,856
Hmph!

1819
01:12:05,414 --> 01:12:07,316
Hey. Yo!

1820
01:12:10,156 --> 01:12:12,092
Can I make a phone call?

1821
01:12:27,856 --> 01:12:30,053
You walking out on me, Louis?

1822
01:12:30,126 --> 01:12:31,492
I've had enough. I'm done.

1823
01:12:31,562 --> 01:12:33,030
You all right, man?

1824
01:12:33,098 --> 01:12:34,590
Um, yeah, yeah. I'm all right.

1825
01:12:34,668 --> 01:12:36,227
You're not all right.
You can't hardly breathe.

1826
01:12:36,304 --> 01:12:38,206
You need a chest X-ray.

1827
01:12:38,275 --> 01:12:40,472
I ain't trying to make no comeback.

1828
01:12:40,546 --> 01:12:42,139
I'm gone, and I want to stay gone.

1829
01:12:42,215 --> 01:12:43,513
That's the thanks I get

1830
01:12:43,584 --> 01:12:44,847
for pulling you out of that rat hole,

1831
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,047
just sitting there waiting to die...

1832
01:12:46,122 --> 01:12:47,716
sitting there waiting to die...

1833
01:12:47,792 --> 01:12:49,351
- die, die...
- It's too late.

1834
01:12:49,428 --> 01:12:51,091
Is there a doctor in the house?

1835
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:55,470
- Keep it short.
- (ringing)

1836
01:12:55,539 --> 01:12:56,973
- (answering machine) Hey...
- Hello.

1837
01:12:57,043 --> 01:12:59,775
It's Cleo. Please leave a message.

1838
01:13:01,684 --> 01:13:02,845
(beep)

1839
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:07,258
Cleo... um, this is, uh, Louis.

1840
01:13:07,328 --> 01:13:09,230
Louis Hinds.

1841
01:13:09,299 --> 01:13:10,665
Your father.

1842
01:13:10,734 --> 01:13:11,861
(chuckle)

1843
01:13:11,937 --> 01:13:14,806
Wow, um,
feels funny saying that.

1844
01:13:14,875 --> 01:13:17,038
I've, um, I've never said it before.

1845
01:13:17,112 --> 01:13:18,843
Um...

1846
01:13:18,916 --> 01:13:20,384
Listen.

1847
01:13:20,452 --> 01:13:22,354
(sigh)

1848
01:13:22,423 --> 01:13:24,620
I didn't mean what I said.

1849
01:13:24,694 --> 01:13:26,060
I was...

1850
01:13:29,068 --> 01:13:32,507
Odetta was the love of my life.

1851
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:34,373
The worst thing
that ever happened to me

1852
01:13:34,445 --> 01:13:38,179
was losing her and you.

1853
01:13:38,251 --> 01:13:39,583
But you turned out great.

1854
01:13:39,654 --> 01:13:42,922
She did a wonderful job with you.

1855
01:13:42,994 --> 01:13:45,760
You know your mother
was an amazing woman.

1856
01:13:45,832 --> 01:13:47,358
And I just want you to know

1857
01:13:47,435 --> 01:13:52,502
I'm really, really glad I met you.

1858
01:13:52,578 --> 01:13:53,671
And I wish l...

1859
01:13:53,747 --> 01:13:54,840
(beep)

1860
01:13:59,156 --> 01:14:00,317
Yo.

1861
01:14:03,865 --> 01:14:05,266
All right.

1862
01:14:05,335 --> 01:14:07,270
(whistling)

1863
01:14:10,778 --> 01:14:13,716
(muttered chatter)

1864
01:14:13,784 --> 01:14:16,516
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

1865
01:14:16,588 --> 01:14:17,521
- (gun clicks)
- Hmm?

1866
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:19,081
Busting your ass out of jail.

1867
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:21,392
What the fuck does it
look like I'm doing?

1868
01:14:21,464 --> 01:14:22,796
Back up, Red. Get your keys out.

1869
01:14:22,866 --> 01:14:23,856
Open that cell, okay?

1870
01:14:23,935 --> 01:14:25,062
Deputy, don't listen to him.

1871
01:14:25,137 --> 01:14:27,505
He will not shoot you.
Not on purpose anyway.

1872
01:14:27,575 --> 01:14:30,045
Don't let him get you fucked up, Red.

1873
01:14:30,113 --> 01:14:31,548
I'll kill you disco-dead.

1874
01:14:31,616 --> 01:14:33,847
Now open that doggone cell, man.

1875
01:14:33,921 --> 01:14:36,152
Stop shaking. If you shake,
I'm gonna start shaking.

1876
01:14:36,224 --> 01:14:37,523
Next thing you know, kapow!

1877
01:14:37,594 --> 01:14:38,823
Go on in.

1878
01:14:38,896 --> 01:14:39,955
Now hand him the keys.

1879
01:14:40,032 --> 01:14:41,728
Hand them to him.

1880
01:14:41,801 --> 01:14:43,235
- Okay?
- Floyd.

1881
01:14:43,304 --> 01:14:44,967
You sure you want to do this?

1882
01:14:45,041 --> 01:14:47,511
Does everything gotta be
a fucking argument with you?

1883
01:14:47,579 --> 01:14:48,945
God damn! Come on out of there!

1884
01:14:49,014 --> 01:14:50,916
Close the door, Lou. Lock it up.

1885
01:14:50,985 --> 01:14:53,319
I'm a hostage.

1886
01:14:53,389 --> 01:14:54,789
You're gonna be a dead hostage

1887
01:14:54,859 --> 01:14:55,986
if you don't shut the fuck up.

1888
01:14:56,061 --> 01:14:57,427
(keys clatter on floor)

1889
01:14:57,497 --> 01:14:59,160
Now look here, Red.

1890
01:14:59,234 --> 01:15:00,793
I like you, almost.

1891
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:03,773
You call anybody outside
your mama, kapow.

1892
01:15:03,842 --> 01:15:05,333
Okay?

1893
01:15:06,179 --> 01:15:07,512
Let's get out of here.

1894
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:11,386
(Floyd)
Anybody following us, man?

1895
01:15:11,456 --> 01:15:12,515
Not yet.

1896
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:15,027
But you can bet your ass they will be.

1897
01:15:15,096 --> 01:15:16,291
Lou, we gotta dump
the Mothership, man.

1898
01:15:16,365 --> 01:15:17,526
We gotta dump it.

1899
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,068
You'd abandon the Mothership?

1900
01:15:19,136 --> 01:15:20,502
We're fugitives from the law.

1901
01:15:20,573 --> 01:15:22,508
We gotta start thinking like it.

1902
01:15:22,576 --> 01:15:24,876
We're not fugitives, O.J.

1903
01:15:24,947 --> 01:15:27,213
You're a fugitive. I'm a hostage.

1904
01:15:27,285 --> 01:15:29,084
That's my story,
and I'm sticking to it.

1905
01:15:29,155 --> 01:15:31,056
(laughing)

1906
01:15:33,931 --> 01:15:34,990
Wait, wait, wait.

1907
01:15:35,066 --> 01:15:36,591
Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold.

1908
01:15:36,669 --> 01:15:38,696
Look at that right there, man.

1909
01:15:38,773 --> 01:15:41,039
Ain't that Lester's car?

1910
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:43,045
Motherfuckers.

1911
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:51,790
We're hungry, man. Come up with some
baked chicken or something.

1912
01:15:57,774 --> 01:15:58,741
They're at it again.

1913
01:15:58,810 --> 01:16:01,372
(no audible dialogue)

1914
01:16:01,448 --> 01:16:02,916
(honk honk)

1915
01:16:02,984 --> 01:16:05,477
Oh, shit! Lester's car!

1916
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:15,468
(knocking)

1917
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:17,441
- You hear that?
- What?

1918
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:19,069
(knocking)

1919
01:16:19,147 --> 01:16:20,740
That.

1920
01:16:20,816 --> 01:16:24,983
Oh, my God!
Oh, God, no! Oh, God...

1921
01:16:26,192 --> 01:16:28,355
Mr. Hinds. Mr. Henderson.

1922
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:29,591
It's so good to see you.

1923
01:16:29,666 --> 01:16:31,135
Oh, my God.

1924
01:16:31,202 --> 01:16:34,640
Oh, it was so hot in there.
You have no idea.

1925
01:16:34,709 --> 01:16:36,701
If there's anything
I can get you,

1926
01:16:36,779 --> 01:16:38,840
like a latte, I'm here for you guys.

1927
01:16:38,916 --> 01:16:40,248
But first I really have to pee,

1928
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:41,685
so I'm just gonna hop on out.

1929
01:16:41,754 --> 01:16:43,656
If you could give me
a hand out of here.

1930
01:16:43,725 --> 01:16:44,886
I've been locked in there,

1931
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,759
and they've had the woofers going all day.

1932
01:16:46,831 --> 01:16:48,390
Oh, my God.

1933
01:16:48,467 --> 01:16:50,835
I just have to pee real bad,
so if you don't mind.

1934
01:16:50,905 --> 01:16:51,964
It's so good to see you.

1935
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,873
Oh, Mr. Hinds...

1936
01:17:01,057 --> 01:17:03,425
Ahh...

1937
01:17:03,495 --> 01:17:04,929
(screaming)

1938
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,629
The body of Marcus Hooks

1939
01:17:07,702 --> 01:17:09,433
arrived at Kennedy Airport
earlier this morning,

1940
01:17:09,506 --> 01:17:11,772
and in a processional befitting a king,

1941
01:17:11,844 --> 01:17:13,836
will make its way
to the Apollo Theatre,

1942
01:17:13,913 --> 01:17:15,006
where it will lie in state...

1943
01:17:15,082 --> 01:17:16,277
I'm watching it right now.

1944
01:17:16,351 --> 01:17:17,341
...appropriately enough,

1945
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:18,718
in a piano-shaped coffin

1946
01:17:18,789 --> 01:17:20,190
for the thousands
of mourners gathered

1947
01:17:20,259 --> 01:17:22,752
to pay tribute
to the beloved soul pioneer.

1948
01:17:22,830 --> 01:17:24,389
Meanwhile, in related news,

1949
01:17:24,466 --> 01:17:25,695
authorities continue the search

1950
01:17:25,769 --> 01:17:27,534
for Floyd Henderson and Louis Hinds,

1951
01:17:27,606 --> 01:17:29,974
following a daring jailbreak
early this morning.

1952
01:17:30,043 --> 01:17:31,773
The two backup singers
were on their way

1953
01:17:31,846 --> 01:17:33,041
to New York City

1954
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:34,709
to perform at tonight's tribute

1955
01:17:34,786 --> 01:17:35,811
honoring their one-time partner.

1956
01:17:35,888 --> 01:17:37,618
Fucking A!

1957
01:17:37,690 --> 01:17:39,557
Local economy is getting
a big boost from...

1958
01:17:39,628 --> 01:17:41,791
- Yeah. No, no. L... I understand.
- (beep)

1959
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:43,424
Uh, that's my other line.

1960
01:17:43,501 --> 01:17:45,060
I'll call you back. This is Danny.

1961
01:17:45,137 --> 01:17:46,230
Hello, Mr. Epstein.

1962
01:17:46,306 --> 01:17:48,971
Phillip Newman.
I broke your stapler last week.

1963
01:17:49,045 --> 01:17:50,445
- Are you kidding me?
- Hello?

1964
01:17:50,514 --> 01:17:51,743
Where the hell are you?

1965
01:17:51,817 --> 01:17:53,616
Listen, I called
because I just wanted to let you know

1966
01:17:53,687 --> 01:17:56,157
that everything's cool,
and we're still on target.

1967
01:17:56,225 --> 01:17:57,454
We?

1968
01:17:57,527 --> 01:17:59,189
You're with Henderson and Hinds?

1969
01:17:59,263 --> 01:18:00,288
Yes, sir.

1970
01:18:00,365 --> 01:18:01,856
They say "motherfucker" a lot,

1971
01:18:01,935 --> 01:18:03,199
but they're really good guys.

1972
01:18:03,271 --> 01:18:04,762
All right, well, good.

1973
01:18:04,841 --> 01:18:06,173
You can give them this message.

1974
01:18:06,243 --> 01:18:07,974
The network just called,
and they're off the show.

1975
01:18:08,047 --> 01:18:09,675
But they can't do that!

1976
01:18:09,749 --> 01:18:11,479
Oh, really? It's VH1.

1977
01:18:11,553 --> 01:18:12,987
Have you seen Flava of Love?

1978
01:18:13,056 --> 01:18:14,957
They can pretty much do
whatever they want.

1979
01:18:15,025 --> 01:18:17,222
And another thing, you're fired.

1980
01:18:17,296 --> 01:18:20,325
Motherfucker! What the fuck?

1981
01:18:29,018 --> 01:18:29,849
What'd he say?

1982
01:18:31,289 --> 01:18:34,021
Uh, he said I'm fired,

1983
01:18:34,094 --> 01:18:38,558
and... and, uh,
and you're off the show.

1984
01:18:45,582 --> 01:18:47,312
Are... Are you serious, man?

1985
01:18:48,655 --> 01:18:50,248
I'm so sorry.

1986
01:19:00,777 --> 01:19:02,507
(sniffle)

1987
01:19:07,488 --> 01:19:10,551
Nnn! Nnn! Nnn!

1988
01:19:10,628 --> 01:19:11,994
(sobbing)

1989
01:19:34,572 --> 01:19:37,202
You know, uh,
according to the map,

1990
01:19:37,276 --> 01:19:40,476
that road leads to the turnpike.

1991
01:19:40,549 --> 01:19:42,177
I think we've still got time to make it.

1992
01:19:42,252 --> 01:19:44,815
Make what, Louis?

1993
01:19:44,891 --> 01:19:46,757
You heard what the motherfucker said!

1994
01:19:46,827 --> 01:19:47,886
It's over!

1995
01:19:47,963 --> 01:19:49,397
Fuck that.

1996
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:57,843
This shit ain't over till we
say it's over, all right?

1997
01:20:00,118 --> 01:20:01,518
Things have changed,

1998
01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:05,652
and I have achieved
a state of mental clarity.

1999
01:20:05,729 --> 01:20:06,958
Ain't that a bitch?

2000
01:20:07,031 --> 01:20:08,260
You hear what this motherfucker said?

2001
01:20:08,333 --> 01:20:11,134
Ever since I knocked
on your door, man,

2002
01:20:11,206 --> 01:20:13,402
you've been beating my balls
at every fucking turn.

2003
01:20:13,476 --> 01:20:17,143
Now all of a sudden, you've
got a state of clarity.

2004
01:20:17,217 --> 01:20:18,947
Where was your clarity in L.A., Lou?

2005
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,511
You can't just dial that shit up

2006
01:20:20,589 --> 01:20:22,855
like you calling for a pizza, motherfucker.

2007
01:20:22,927 --> 01:20:25,763
You got to go inside, do the work.

2008
01:20:25,833 --> 01:20:28,429
Consequently,
I have a confession.

2009
01:20:29,873 --> 01:20:34,211
Floyd, you were right about me.

2010
01:20:34,281 --> 01:20:38,277
I have given up on a lot
of things in my life.

2011
01:20:38,355 --> 01:20:40,825
But I ain't giving up on this. All right?

2012
01:20:40,893 --> 01:20:44,697
Come on, man, we've been through
enough shit the last few days.

2013
01:20:44,768 --> 01:20:46,168
We can do this.

2014
01:20:46,237 --> 01:20:48,969
And I dare anybody
to try to stop us.

2015
01:20:49,041 --> 01:20:51,011
Let's go, motherfucker.

2016
01:20:51,079 --> 01:20:52,206
Shotgun.

2017
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:55,075
Get your ass in the backseat.

2018
01:20:55,319 --> 01:20:58,155
* Ain't no stoppin' us now *

2019
01:20:58,225 --> 01:21:00,023
* We're on the move *

2020
01:21:03,836 --> 01:21:07,274
* There's been so many
things that's held us down *

2021
01:21:07,342 --> 01:21:09,174
* But now it looks *

2022
01:21:09,245 --> 01:21:12,080
* Like things are finally coming around *

2023
01:21:13,453 --> 01:21:17,392
* Don't you let nothing, nothing *

2024
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:21,456
* Stand in your way *

2025
01:21:21,534 --> 01:21:25,338
* I want y'all to listen, listen *

2026
01:21:25,409 --> 01:21:28,939
* To every word I say,
every word I say *

2027
01:21:29,015 --> 01:21:31,485
* Ain't no stopping us now *

2028
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:32,919
* No, no, no *

2029
01:21:32,989 --> 01:21:34,457
* We're on the move *

2030
01:21:34,525 --> 01:21:37,793
* The movin' groovin' *

2031
01:21:37,865 --> 01:21:40,233
* Ain't no stopping us now *

2032
01:21:40,302 --> 01:21:42,238
Full sound and switch on all
the floor monitors, all right?

2033
01:21:42,306 --> 01:21:44,469
Look at that.
That's nice and subtle.

2034
01:21:44,544 --> 01:21:45,671
I'm on it, then. Sound check.

2035
01:21:45,746 --> 01:21:46,713
Okay. Thanks.

2036
01:21:46,781 --> 01:21:47,713
- Mr. Epstein.
- Yeah?

2037
01:21:47,782 --> 01:21:49,080
Hey, thank God you're here.

2038
01:21:49,152 --> 01:21:50,312
Oh, God, this isn't happening.

2039
01:21:50,388 --> 01:21:52,220
What are you doing here?
I thought I fired you.

2040
01:21:52,291 --> 01:21:54,454
I just wanted to tell you
I'm not alone.

2041
01:22:00,706 --> 01:22:02,072
You guys are insane!

2042
01:22:02,142 --> 01:22:03,771
Good to see you, too, Little Ep.

2043
01:22:03,846 --> 01:22:05,941
Yeah, this is never going to happen.

2044
01:22:06,017 --> 01:22:08,715
You'll be arrested
the moment the cops spot you.

2045
01:22:08,788 --> 01:22:10,586
We don't care anything about that.

2046
01:22:10,658 --> 01:22:12,594
We just want to do our song.

2047
01:22:12,662 --> 01:22:14,894
Oh, one other thing.
You got a few minutes?

2048
01:22:14,966 --> 01:22:16,434
Yeah, I got all the time
in the world.

2049
01:22:16,502 --> 01:22:18,131
I'm just producing a television show

2050
01:22:18,205 --> 01:22:19,833
with dozens of huge musical acts

2051
01:22:19,908 --> 01:22:22,037
that goes live in 171/2 minutes,

2052
01:22:22,112 --> 01:22:24,048
but you know, let's grab some coffee
and have a little chit-chat.

2053
01:22:29,793 --> 01:22:32,161
Wow. How long's he got?

2054
01:22:34,034 --> 01:22:35,127
We don't know.

2055
01:22:37,174 --> 01:22:38,163
All right.

2056
01:22:38,242 --> 01:22:40,302
I'll see what I can do. Okay?

2057
01:22:40,379 --> 01:22:41,973
Thank you.

2058
01:22:45,254 --> 01:22:48,317
(Announcer)
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and
gentlemen,

2059
01:22:48,394 --> 01:22:50,387
please take your seats.

2060
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:52,731
The ceremony will begin shortly.

2061
01:22:52,802 --> 01:22:55,136
(chatter)

2062
01:22:55,207 --> 01:22:57,370
(knock on door)

2063
01:22:57,444 --> 01:22:58,912
I'll get it.

2064
01:23:03,154 --> 01:23:04,247
Wow!

2065
01:23:04,323 --> 01:23:05,792
The Black Moses.

2066
01:23:06,928 --> 01:23:07,895
How's it going, man?

2067
01:23:07,963 --> 01:23:09,056
Hey, what's happening?

2068
01:23:09,132 --> 01:23:10,065
What's up, baby?

2069
01:23:10,134 --> 01:23:11,067
Hey, fellas.

2070
01:23:11,136 --> 01:23:12,468
Hey, what's happening?

2071
01:23:12,538 --> 01:23:13,972
- The man.
- My man.

2072
01:23:14,041 --> 01:23:15,168
Okay, all right.

2073
01:23:15,244 --> 01:23:17,440
Heard you were here.
Just wanted to wish you luck.

2074
01:23:18,582 --> 01:23:19,572
Oh, by the way,

2075
01:23:19,651 --> 01:23:21,245
brought somebody by to see you.

2076
01:23:21,321 --> 01:23:22,379
Oh, is that right?

2077
01:23:22,457 --> 01:23:23,755
Yeah.

2078
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:33,065
Okay, everybody,
let's move on out of here.

2079
01:23:33,142 --> 01:23:34,371
Come on.

2080
01:23:34,446 --> 01:23:36,312
(Phillip)
All right, you heard what Mr. Henderson said.

2081
01:23:36,382 --> 01:23:37,315
After you, young man.

2082
01:23:37,384 --> 01:23:39,114
Okay.

2083
01:23:58,723 --> 01:24:01,785
I'm sorry I ran out the way I did.

2084
01:24:02,997 --> 01:24:05,331
I'm the one who ran out.

2085
01:24:05,401 --> 01:24:07,530
There's no need for you to apologize.

2086
01:24:13,483 --> 01:24:15,282
Can I help you with your tie?

2087
01:24:15,354 --> 01:24:16,652
Yeah, sure.

2088
01:24:16,723 --> 01:24:18,750
You know what you're doing?

2089
01:24:18,827 --> 01:24:20,659
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

2090
01:24:22,199 --> 01:24:23,828
Here you go.

2091
01:24:25,940 --> 01:24:27,772
Mm! Ohh!

2092
01:24:29,413 --> 01:24:30,642
You all right?

2093
01:24:30,715 --> 01:24:32,513
Yeah. Just some water, please.

2094
01:24:32,585 --> 01:24:33,553
Damn!

2095
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:34,918
All cameras are on point.

2096
01:24:34,989 --> 01:24:36,184
We just added two mics.

2097
01:24:36,258 --> 01:24:37,921
Mr. Epstein!
You better come quick.

2098
01:24:37,995 --> 01:24:39,588
Come on, I'm serious.
Come on! It's important!

2099
01:24:39,665 --> 01:24:40,826
All right. Take care of those.

2100
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:41,925
15 minutes, Danny.

2101
01:24:42,938 --> 01:24:44,702
(groan)

2102
01:24:44,774 --> 01:24:45,867
He just collapsed.

2103
01:24:45,943 --> 01:24:47,674
I think he's in a lot of pain.

2104
01:24:47,746 --> 01:24:49,214
Open your hand.
Open your hand.

2105
01:24:49,282 --> 01:24:50,341
Right there, right there.

2106
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:52,786
Okay, okay.

2107
01:24:53,958 --> 01:24:56,292
Be strong, brother.
Hang on in there.

2108
01:24:56,362 --> 01:24:58,229
It ain't time for you to check out now.

2109
01:24:58,299 --> 01:24:59,562
Check out? What?

2110
01:24:59,635 --> 01:25:01,969
Come on, man.
Everybody knows, man.

2111
01:25:02,039 --> 01:25:04,373
My aunt was taking the same
doggone pills, man.

2112
01:25:04,444 --> 01:25:07,108
Took her about a week
before she wasted away to nothing,

2113
01:25:07,182 --> 01:25:08,377
just kicking and screaming.

2114
01:25:08,451 --> 01:25:09,817
I don't know what killed her ass,

2115
01:25:09,886 --> 01:25:13,188
but if she was taking those,
she had a bladder infection.

2116
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:14,387
Say what?

2117
01:25:14,462 --> 01:25:17,628
Look, Doctor Dumbshit,
I got a kidney stone.

2118
01:25:17,701 --> 01:25:19,192
Hurts like a motherfucker
when I pee,

2119
01:25:19,271 --> 01:25:20,534
but it ain't gonna kill me.

2120
01:25:20,606 --> 01:25:21,801
So you're not dying?

2121
01:25:21,875 --> 01:25:25,245
From the first slap and cry,
we all start to die.

2122
01:25:25,315 --> 01:25:27,980
But I ain't on no accelerated program,
hell, no.

2123
01:25:28,054 --> 01:25:30,250
Ain't that about a bitch?

2124
01:25:30,324 --> 01:25:33,194
All that damn hard work,
busting your ass out of jail,

2125
01:25:33,263 --> 01:25:34,424
and you ain't even dying.

2126
01:25:34,499 --> 01:25:35,865
I was kinda looking forward
to seeing you go.

2127
01:25:35,934 --> 01:25:38,131
Excuse me, Danny.
They're on in two.

2128
01:25:38,205 --> 01:25:39,798
All right. Where we at, guys?

2129
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:42,707
Okay, I'm good.

2130
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:48,180
The Apollo, the mecca.

2131
01:25:48,257 --> 01:25:49,658
This brings back memories, man.

2132
01:25:49,727 --> 01:25:51,355
How many times you think
we've performed here?

2133
01:25:51,430 --> 01:25:52,625
Ooh, uh...

2134
01:25:52,699 --> 01:25:53,997
ooh, five-oh.

2135
01:25:54,068 --> 01:25:55,036
50, really?

2136
01:25:55,103 --> 01:25:56,469
- Five-oh.
- Oh!

2137
01:25:56,539 --> 01:25:57,700
Come on. Move, move.

2138
01:25:57,774 --> 01:25:59,539
That's them! Hold it! Hold it!

2139
01:25:59,611 --> 01:26:01,877
(police radio)
All units report, all units report.

2140
01:26:01,949 --> 01:26:03,349
Suspects have been spotted.

2141
01:26:03,418 --> 01:26:06,390
All units, apprehend them quietly
and by the book.

2142
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,729
Hey, Lou, do you think
they're gone, man?

2143
01:26:09,796 --> 01:26:11,322
I don't have X-ray vision, motherfucker!

2144
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,425
How would I know?

2145
01:26:12,502 --> 01:26:14,734
Lower your voice, Lou.
Doggone it, man.

2146
01:26:14,806 --> 01:26:16,638
It's so dark in here you can't see shit.

2147
01:26:16,709 --> 01:26:17,938
Hold up.

2148
01:26:18,011 --> 01:26:19,446
Let me see if I can reach my lighter.

2149
01:26:19,515 --> 01:26:20,642
Don't light no lighter
up in here, man.

2150
01:26:20,717 --> 01:26:22,208
We'll blow up like a barbecue.

2151
01:26:22,286 --> 01:26:23,879
Hold on one minute.

2152
01:26:23,956 --> 01:26:25,653
Shit.

2153
01:26:28,364 --> 01:26:29,332
(chuckle)

2154
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:32,428
Marcus motherfucking Hooks.

2155
01:26:32,505 --> 01:26:34,907
Long way from Linwood Street, huh,
motherfucker?

2156
01:26:34,977 --> 01:26:37,310
Fuck Linwood Street and him.

2157
01:26:37,381 --> 01:26:39,316
He used both of us, and you know it.

2158
01:26:39,384 --> 01:26:41,980
Come on, man. He just thought
he'd be a bigger star going solo.

2159
01:26:42,055 --> 01:26:43,045
He was right.

2160
01:26:43,124 --> 01:26:44,387
No he wasn't.

2161
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:46,123
He didn't want to split
the money three ways.

2162
01:26:46,197 --> 01:26:47,324
Just look at him, sitting there

2163
01:26:47,399 --> 01:26:49,460
with that old shit-eating
grin on his face.

2164
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:52,030
You think you're all that, motherfucker,
don't you?

2165
01:26:52,108 --> 01:26:53,940
I have to admit, every time
I think about you,

2166
01:26:54,011 --> 01:26:56,277
I could just choke the shit out of you!

2167
01:26:56,348 --> 01:26:57,475
Stop it, stop it!

2168
01:26:57,551 --> 01:26:59,384
Floyd, he ain't
thinking shit. He's dead.

2169
01:27:02,026 --> 01:27:05,089
Say, ain't that my watch?

2170
01:27:05,165 --> 01:27:07,157
See? You thought
I stole that mother...

2171
01:27:07,236 --> 01:27:09,262
I told you this motherfucker
was a klepto!

2172
01:27:09,339 --> 01:27:10,705
Shit, look at that.

2173
01:27:10,775 --> 01:27:12,142
That's nice.

2174
01:27:12,212 --> 01:27:13,305
Probably stole that, too.

2175
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:15,646
Motherfucker always had
good taste, though.

2176
01:27:15,718 --> 01:27:17,050
I'm gonna keep this.

2177
01:27:21,696 --> 01:27:23,528
Hey, Louis.

2178
01:27:23,599 --> 01:27:25,796
You think if, you know...

2179
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:27,840
if he wouldn't have, you know, died,

2180
01:27:27,907 --> 01:27:29,205
you think we would have
got back together?

2181
01:27:29,276 --> 01:27:30,869
Oh, hell, no.

2182
01:27:30,945 --> 01:27:32,778
But you know what?

2183
01:27:32,849 --> 01:27:33,908
We are together,

2184
01:27:33,985 --> 01:27:36,046
and I've been thinking
about our little arrangement.

2185
01:27:36,122 --> 01:27:37,111
I'm gonna go ahead

2186
01:27:37,191 --> 01:27:40,321
and break you off 50/50, all right?

2187
01:27:40,396 --> 01:27:41,990
Wow, Lou, that's...

2188
01:27:42,066 --> 01:27:44,730
that's real black of you, man.

2189
01:27:44,804 --> 01:27:46,432
Because there ain't no money.

2190
01:27:46,507 --> 01:27:47,532
Say what?

2191
01:27:47,609 --> 01:27:49,579
Well, you said it yourself.

2192
01:27:49,647 --> 01:27:50,637
It's a funeral.

2193
01:27:50,715 --> 01:27:51,876
Nobody pays you to sing, man.

2194
01:27:51,951 --> 01:27:53,351
You lied about the money?

2195
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:55,356
- Yeah.
- You motherfucker.

2196
01:27:55,424 --> 01:27:57,290
Hey, you can't say
it wasn't worth it.

2197
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,227
Well, I could say it.

2198
01:28:01,101 --> 01:28:02,899
But I'd be lying.

2199
01:28:02,971 --> 01:28:04,634
(laughing)
I love you, Lou.

2200
01:28:04,708 --> 01:28:06,802
My nigger.

2201
01:28:06,878 --> 01:28:08,905
But this motherfucker,
you know, I can't help it.

2202
01:28:08,982 --> 01:28:11,077
Every time,
I could just kill this motherfucker!

2203
01:28:11,153 --> 01:28:13,123
That's why he left, because
you was always picking on him.

2204
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:14,249
Stop fucking with him.

2205
01:28:14,326 --> 01:28:16,227
He fucked with my happiness.

2206
01:28:17,331 --> 01:28:19,233
(applause)

2207
01:28:25,145 --> 01:28:26,875
Ladies and gentlemen,

2208
01:28:26,948 --> 01:28:29,418
I'm Isaac Hayes.

2209
01:28:29,486 --> 01:28:31,183
(cheering, applause)

2210
01:28:31,256 --> 01:28:33,248
Where the fuck are they, Danny?

2211
01:28:33,327 --> 01:28:36,355
(Isaac Hayes)
My good friends, please join me

2212
01:28:36,432 --> 01:28:40,201
in saying farewell
to brother Marcus Hooks.

2213
01:28:42,810 --> 01:28:44,837
(audience gasps)

2214
01:28:46,217 --> 01:28:47,583
(Woman)
It's Louis and Floyd!

2215
01:28:47,653 --> 01:28:48,780
It's the Real Deal!

2216
01:28:48,855 --> 01:28:51,850
Oh!

2217
01:28:51,927 --> 01:28:54,727
Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal,

2218
01:28:54,799 --> 01:28:56,530
back together again.

2219
01:28:56,603 --> 01:28:57,764
Give them a hand.

2220
01:28:57,838 --> 01:28:59,534
Give them a hand.

2221
01:28:59,608 --> 01:29:02,512
Reunited, y'all.

2222
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:03,980
They got their shit together.

2223
01:29:04,050 --> 01:29:06,886
Yes! Let's go!

2224
01:29:06,955 --> 01:29:08,787
Stand by.
Move in on my command.

2225
01:29:08,858 --> 01:29:10,326
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

2226
01:29:10,395 --> 01:29:12,057
Come on, Officer
detective person.

2227
01:29:12,131 --> 01:29:13,394
Please, just, you know, come on.

2228
01:29:13,467 --> 01:29:15,334
Let them sing one song.
One little song.

2229
01:29:15,404 --> 01:29:17,066
It's not gonna hurt anybody.

2230
01:29:17,140 --> 01:29:18,769
(Hayes)
The Real Deal!

2231
01:29:21,047 --> 01:29:24,110
All right. One song.

2232
01:29:24,187 --> 01:29:26,089
But it better be good.

2233
01:29:27,126 --> 01:29:30,120
One song. The good one.

2234
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:35,867
How's that hip?

2235
01:29:35,942 --> 01:29:37,035
Locked and loaded, baby.

2236
01:29:37,111 --> 01:29:38,374
Let's do this.

2237
01:29:39,815 --> 01:29:41,512
Band!

2238
01:29:41,586 --> 01:29:43,578
Let's take a walk in the park.

2239
01:29:43,655 --> 01:29:45,955
1, 2, 3, 4!

2240
01:29:57,515 --> 01:29:59,678
* Oh, yeah *

2241
01:29:59,752 --> 01:30:02,120
* When the river gets to rollin' *

2242
01:30:02,190 --> 01:30:05,822
* And then you add
a bowlful of soul in *

2243
01:30:05,897 --> 01:30:09,165
* And then I tried
to let it all go then *

2244
01:30:09,236 --> 01:30:10,898
* Oh, yeah *

2245
01:30:10,972 --> 01:30:13,101
* Oh, it's easy to me *

2246
01:30:13,177 --> 01:30:16,547
* You see, the way
I ride the rhythm *

2247
01:30:16,616 --> 01:30:20,180
* You see, the truth
is all I can give 'em *

2248
01:30:20,256 --> 01:30:22,954
* And the lyrics can
come from livin' *

2249
01:30:23,028 --> 01:30:26,728
* Oh, yeah, oh, it's easy to me *

2250
01:30:26,801 --> 01:30:28,498
* Oh, yeah *

2251
01:30:28,572 --> 01:30:32,534
* Music comes out of my heart *

2252
01:30:32,612 --> 01:30:36,575
* Something like a walking the park *

2253
01:30:36,653 --> 01:30:39,715
* It's just a walk in the park *

2254
01:30:39,792 --> 01:30:41,591
* Oh, yeah *

2255
01:30:41,662 --> 01:30:44,394
* And no one else in here, I heard it *

2256
01:30:44,467 --> 01:30:48,099
* I don't know what I've
done to deserve it *

2257
01:30:48,174 --> 01:30:51,772
* You don't question it
while you serve it *

2258
01:30:51,847 --> 01:30:53,110
* Oh, yeah *

2259
01:30:53,183 --> 01:30:55,176
* Oh, it was given to me *

2260
01:30:55,254 --> 01:30:58,784
* I got something you inherit *

2261
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:01,889
* I don't know that you
was born to share it *

2262
01:31:01,966 --> 01:31:05,905
* And if you shoot,
be sure you wear it *

2263
01:31:05,973 --> 01:31:07,909
* Oh, yeah *

2264
01:31:07,977 --> 01:31:09,309
* Oh, it comes naturally to me *

2265
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:11,612
* Uh-huh-uh *

2266
01:31:11,684 --> 01:31:13,779
* Music comes out of my heart *

2267
01:31:13,855 --> 01:31:15,323
* Yeah *

2268
01:31:15,391 --> 01:31:18,989
* Something like a walk in the park *

2269
01:31:19,064 --> 01:31:21,057
* It's just a walk in the park *

2270
01:31:21,135 --> 01:31:22,103
* Oh, yeah *

2271
01:31:22,170 --> 01:31:24,002
* Oh, yeah *

2272
01:31:24,073 --> 01:31:26,806
Oh, yeah!

2273
01:31:26,879 --> 01:31:28,939
Y'all having a good time
out here tonight?

2274
01:31:29,015 --> 01:31:31,042
This is what I'm talking about!

2275
01:31:31,119 --> 01:31:33,282
You know about that
walk in the park, man?

2276
01:31:33,357 --> 01:31:34,848
Sure I know about
that walk in the park.

2277
01:31:34,926 --> 01:31:36,418
You do? I'll tell you what.

2278
01:31:36,496 --> 01:31:38,260
- Show them.
- Got to get down.

2279
01:31:39,970 --> 01:31:42,566
(audience cheering)

2280
01:31:46,081 --> 01:31:47,276
Ladies and gentlemen,

2281
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:49,342
let's give a big Apollo welcome

2282
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:51,321
to the stage for the first time,

2283
01:31:51,390 --> 01:31:55,524
my daughter, Miss Cleo Whitfield!

2284
01:31:55,598 --> 01:31:59,196
* To make something out of nothin' *

2285
01:31:59,271 --> 01:32:02,710
* That's what we all

01:32:09,891 --> 01:32:13,056
* I'll give you something

2292
01:32:20,276 --> 01:32:22,075
* Oh, yeah *

2293
01:32:22,147 --> 01:32:25,984
* Sing along with me *

2294
01:32:26,054 --> 01:32:29,584
* Music comes out of my heart *

2295
01:32:29,660 --> 01:32:32,062
* Something like a walk
in the park *

2296
01:32:32,131 --> 01:32:33,292
* It's just a walk in the park *

2297
01:32:33,367 --> 01:32:35,394
* It's just a walk in the park *

2298
01:32:35,471 --> 01:32:37,064
* Oh, yeah, oh, yeah *

2299
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:38,734
* Oh, yeah *

2300
01:32:40,246 --> 01:32:43,081
* Music comes out of my heart *

2301
01:32:43,151 --> 01:32:47,524
* Something like a walk
in the park *

2302
01:32:47,593 --> 01:32:50,393
* It's just a walk in the park *

2303
01:32:50,466 --> 01:32:52,731
* Oh, yeah *

2304
01:32:54,506 --> 01:32:57,204
* Music comes out of my heart *

2305
01:32:57,277 --> 01:32:58,711
One song.

2306
01:32:58,781 --> 01:33:00,875
* Something like a walk in the park *

2307
01:33:00,951 --> 01:33:02,249
* A walk in the park *

2308
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,290
* It's just a walk in the park *

2309
01:33:04,357 --> 01:33:05,620
* A walk in the park *

2310
01:33:05,693 --> 01:33:07,663
* Oh, yeah *

2311
01:33:07,730 --> 01:33:10,257
* Music comes out of my heart *

2312
01:33:10,335 --> 01:33:12,396
I'm their manager!

2313
01:33:12,472 --> 01:33:14,567
* Something like a walk in the park *

2314
01:33:14,643 --> 01:33:16,407
* Walk in the park *

2315
01:33:16,479 --> 01:33:17,674
* It's just a walk in the park *

2316
01:33:17,748 --> 01:33:23,817
* Just like a walk in the park *

2317
01:33:26,063 --> 01:33:29,297
* Oh, yeah *

2318
01:33:43,729 --> 01:33:44,992
Whoo!

2319
01:33:45,065 --> 01:33:46,967
(sobbing)

2320
01:33:57,522 --> 01:34:00,687
* Yeah, ooh, yeah *

2321
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,992
** (Motown)

2322
01:34:17,458 --> 01:34:19,428
* Doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo *

2323
01:34:19,495 --> 01:34:20,554
* Haah *

2324
01:34:20,631 --> 01:34:22,327
You're gonna sing real nice tonight.

2325
01:34:24,437 --> 01:34:25,496
All right, y'all.

2326
01:34:25,573 --> 01:34:28,271
* Got that funky time *

2327
01:34:28,344 --> 01:34:31,407
* I can feel it *

2328
01:34:31,484 --> 01:34:35,014
* I can feel it *

2329
01:34:35,090 --> 01:34:36,957
* I can feel it *

2330
01:34:38,597 --> 01:34:40,965
Any time the camera
or the mic comes on,

2331
01:34:41,035 --> 01:34:42,469
I don't cheat myself.

2332
01:34:42,537 --> 01:34:44,939
That was rule number 1
I was taught as a kid.

2333
01:34:45,008 --> 01:34:46,807
And I definitely can't
cheat the audience.

2334
01:34:46,879 --> 01:34:48,677
So I give 150%

2335
01:34:48,748 --> 01:34:51,845
every single time that I do anything.

2336
01:34:51,921 --> 01:34:53,686
Even the way I live my life.

2337
01:34:53,758 --> 01:34:56,627
I just cherish
each doggone moment.

2338
01:34:56,697 --> 01:34:59,224
A black preacher's
something else, ain't it?

2339
01:34:59,301 --> 01:35:02,330
You can't pay your rent
after you come from church.

2340
01:35:04,378 --> 01:35:06,313
And if you ask the preacher
for the $5.00,

2341
01:35:06,381 --> 01:35:09,376
he'll be like, "Fuck you
in the name of Jesus."

2342
01:35:09,454 --> 01:35:12,220
My comedy is not fictitious.

2343
01:35:12,292 --> 01:35:15,560
My comedy has
to come from my heart.

2344
01:35:15,631 --> 01:35:18,193
(clapping in rhythm)

2345
01:35:18,269 --> 01:35:20,967
- Charlie Chan was a hell of a man.
- All right, let's rehearse.

2346
01:35:21,041 --> 01:35:23,569
He went through China
with his shit in his hand.

2347
01:35:23,646 --> 01:35:26,139
Had five women against the wall.

2348
01:35:26,218 --> 01:35:28,950
I betcha five dollars
that he fucked them all.

2349
01:35:29,022 --> 01:35:30,320
He fucked them hard.

2350
01:35:30,392 --> 01:35:31,519
He fucked them long.

2351
01:35:31,594 --> 01:35:34,156
He fucked them till his shit got sore.

2352
01:35:34,233 --> 01:35:36,703
He went to the doctor,
and the doctor said,

2353
01:35:36,771 --> 01:35:39,105
"Sorry, Charlie, your dick is dead."

2354
01:35:39,175 --> 01:35:42,010
He said, "Doctor, Doctor,
that can't be true."

2355
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:44,710
"Yes, sir, Charlie,
your balls are too!"

2356
01:35:46,555 --> 01:35:48,319
I've been performing all my life.

2357
01:35:48,391 --> 01:35:50,054
So being in front of an audience

2358
01:35:50,128 --> 01:35:51,756
has never been a problem for me.

2359
01:35:51,831 --> 01:35:53,664
It's time to go?

2360
01:35:54,603 --> 01:35:55,969
Well, go on, then.

2361
01:35:56,039 --> 01:35:58,805
(laughter, applause)

2362
01:35:58,877 --> 01:36:01,643
You want to leave a lasting impression
on your audience.

2363
01:36:01,715 --> 01:36:04,278
You know, and that's something
I was taught, too,

2364
01:36:04,354 --> 01:36:05,652
when I first started.

2365
01:36:05,723 --> 01:36:06,952
Always make them remember you,

2366
01:36:07,026 --> 01:36:09,826
or remember something
about you and the film.

2367
01:36:09,897 --> 01:36:13,529
I'm going back to my
$600-a-night hotel room,

2368
01:36:13,604 --> 01:36:18,546
have me a nice-ass, uh,
piece of pussy and shit.

2369
01:36:18,614 --> 01:36:19,673
Okay?

2370
01:36:19,749 --> 01:36:21,809
Cut it.

2371
01:36:21,886 --> 01:36:23,515
(screaming)

2372
01:36:23,590 --> 01:36:24,683
Okay, just breathe. Breathe.

2373
01:36:24,758 --> 01:36:26,784
I'm not even in yet.

2374
01:36:26,863 --> 01:36:28,957
* I got to boogie for you *

2375
01:36:29,032 --> 01:36:31,002
* I got to boogie for you *

2376
01:36:31,070 --> 01:36:33,336
* I got nothin' but boogie *

2377
01:36:33,407 --> 01:36:35,707
* Nothin' but boogie for you *

2378
01:36:35,778 --> 01:36:37,680
* I got nothin' but boogie *

2379
01:36:37,749 --> 01:36:39,377
* Nothin' but boogie for you *

2380
01:36:39,452 --> 01:36:41,183
* Boogie, boogie *

2381
01:36:41,256 --> 01:36:42,245
* Boogie, boogie *

2382
01:36:42,323 --> 01:36:43,484
* Boogie, boogie *

2383
01:36:43,559 --> 01:36:44,458
* Boogie, boogie *

2384
01:36:44,528 --> 01:36:45,496
* Boogie, boogie *

2385
01:36:45,563 --> 01:36:46,997
* Boogie, boogie *

2386
01:36:47,065 --> 01:36:50,094
(cheering)

2387
01:36:50,171 --> 01:36:52,903
I want to say thanks to you all

2388
01:36:52,976 --> 01:36:56,710
because you all made me... yeah.

2389
01:37:00,891 --> 01:37:03,691
I wouldn't have
no TV show or movies.

2390
01:37:03,763 --> 01:37:05,630
You all was coming to see me,

2391
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:07,362
and you all made me...

2392
01:37:07,436 --> 01:37:10,374
Chattanooga, Louisiana, Mississippi.

2393
01:37:10,442 --> 01:37:11,501
(cheering)

2394
01:37:11,578 --> 01:37:13,571
So thank you.

2395
01:37:13,648 --> 01:37:16,210
I think if I had a few free passes

2396
01:37:16,286 --> 01:37:17,584
like a lot of people,

2397
01:37:17,655 --> 01:37:20,148
I don't think I would be
as successful as I have.

2398
01:37:20,226 --> 01:37:21,889
My task here on Earth

2399
01:37:21,964 --> 01:37:25,094
is I have to work harder
than the average bear.

2400
01:37:25,169 --> 01:37:26,102
It look easy, don't it?

2401
01:37:26,171 --> 01:37:28,971
(Woman)
But it's not.

2402
01:37:29,043 --> 01:37:31,570
Thank you, sweetheart. Thank you.

2403
01:37:35,622 --> 01:37:40,290
* I never can say goodbye *

2404
01:37:40,364 --> 01:37:42,698
* No, no, no, I *

2405
01:37:42,768 --> 01:37:46,332
* I never can say goodbye *

2406
01:37:46,408 --> 01:37:48,344
* No, no, no, *

2407
01:37:48,412 --> 01:37:51,873
* Even though the pain
and heartaches *

2408
01:37:51,952 --> 01:37:55,219
* Seem to follow me wherever I go *

2409
01:37:55,290 --> 01:37:59,253
* Though I try and try
to hide my feelings *

2410
01:37:59,332 --> 01:38:02,030
* They always seem to show *

2411
01:38:02,103 --> 01:38:05,735
* Then you try to say
you're leaving me *

2412
01:38:05,810 --> 01:38:09,214
* And I always have to say no *

2413
01:38:09,283 --> 01:38:12,084
* Tell me why *

2414
01:38:12,156 --> 01:38:14,752
* Is it so *

2415
01:38:14,827 --> 01:38:21,135
* I never can say goodbye *

2416
01:38:21,205 --> 01:38:23,141
* No, no, no, no *

2417
01:38:23,209 --> 01:38:29,244
* I never can say goodbye *

2418
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:33,020
* I keep thinkin' that our problems *

2419
01:38:33,094 --> 01:38:36,362
* Soon are gonna all work out *

2420
01:38:36,433 --> 01:38:39,564
* But there's that same unhappy feeling *

2421
01:38:39,639 --> 01:38:43,133
* That makes that anguish
twist that doubt *

2422
01:38:43,213 --> 01:38:46,616
* It's that same old dizzy hangup *

2423
01:38:46,685 --> 01:38:50,352
* Can't live with you or without *

2424
01:38:50,426 --> 01:38:53,295
* Tell me why *

2425
01:38:53,364 --> 01:38:55,630
* Is it so *

2426
01:38:55,702 --> 01:38:58,936
* I don't wanna let you go *

2427
01:38:59,008 --> 01:39:04,143
* I never can say goodbye *

2428
01:39:04,217 --> 01:39:06,278
* I, I'll never *

2429
01:39:06,355 --> 01:39:07,880
* Say goodbye *

2430
01:39:07,957 --> 01:39:10,393
* I won't say goodbye *

2431
01:39:10,462 --> 01:39:12,659
* I won't try *

2432
01:39:12,733 --> 01:39:14,600
* I won't let you go *

2433
01:39:14,670 --> 01:39:16,366
* Won't say goodbye *

2434
01:39:16,439 --> 01:39:18,204
* I can't say goodbye *

2435
01:39:18,277 --> 01:39:19,404
* No *

2436
01:39:19,479 --> 01:39:22,314
* I won't *

2437
01:39:23,686 --> 01:39:24,619
* Oh, yeah *

2438
01:39:24,688 --> 01:39:27,056
* I won't say goodbye *

2439
01:39:27,126 --> 01:39:29,358
* I won't try *

2440
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:31,059
* Can't say goodbye *

2441
01:39:31,134 --> 01:39:32,864
* Won't say goodbye *

2442
01:39:32,937 --> 01:39:35,203
* I can't say goodbye *

2443
01:39:35,274 --> 01:39:36,401
* No *

2444
01:39:36,476 --> 01:39:38,673
* I want you all the time *
