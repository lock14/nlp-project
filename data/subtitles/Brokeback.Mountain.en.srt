00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,661
If you pair of deuces
are lookin’ for work,

3
00:04:26,871 --> 00:04:30,833
I suggest you get your
scrawny asses in here, pronto.

4
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,183
Now, up on Brokeback

5
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:49,187
the Forest Service has got designated campsites
on the allotments.

6
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:53,192
Them camps can be three our four miles
from where we pasture the woollies.

7
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:57,196
Bad predator loss, ’cause nobody’s
lookin’ after ’em at night.

8
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,199
Now, what I want

9
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,159
is a camp tender

10
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:05,206
to stay at the main camp
where the Forest Service says.

11
00:05:05,206 --> 00:05:09,961
But the herder, he’s gonna
pitch a pup tent on the q.t. with the sheep,

12
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:12,214
and he’s gonna sleep there.

13
00:05:12,214 --> 00:05:15,217
You eat your supper and breakfast at camp.

14
00:05:15,217 --> 00:05:17,219
But you sleep with the sheep.

15
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:19,221
A hundred percent.

16
00:05:19,221 --> 00:05:22,225
No fire, don’t leave no sign.

17
00:05:22,225 --> 00:05:26,146
You roll up that tent very morning
in case the Forest Service snoops around.

18
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,191
Yeah?

19
00:05:30,484 --> 00:05:32,153
No.

20
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:35,198
No!

21
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:41,163
Not on your fuckin’ life.

22
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:45,418
You got your dogs, a .30-.30.
You sleep there.

23
00:05:47,253 --> 00:05:51,257
Last summer I had a goddam near 25% loss.
I don’t want that again.

24
00:05:51,257 --> 00:05:53,218
You...

25
00:05:54,261 --> 00:05:57,264
Fridays at noon to by down by the bridge,

26
00:05:57,264 --> 00:05:59,266
with a grocery list and mules.

27
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:02,270
Somebody with supplies,

28
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,275
will be there at the pick-up.

29
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:10,196
Tomorrow morning we’ll truck you up
to the jump off.

30
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,312
Jack Twist.

31
00:06:39,312 --> 00:06:41,314
Ennis.

32
00:06:41,314 --> 00:06:43,316
Your folks just stopped at Ennis?

33
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:45,277
Del Mar.

34
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,241
Nice to know you, Ennis Del Mar.

35
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,347
My second year up here.

36
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:14,351
Last year, one storm,
the lightning killed 42 sheep.

37
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:18,356
I thought I’d asphyxiate from the smell.

38
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:22,361
Aguirre got all over my ass,
like I was supposed to control the weather.

39
00:07:22,361 --> 00:07:25,364
It beats working for my old man.

40
00:07:25,364 --> 00:07:28,367
Can’t please my old man, no way.

41
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:30,370
That’s why I took the rodeo.

42
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,373
You ever rodeo?

43
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:37,377
Yeah... well... I mean once in a while.

44
00:07:37,377 --> 00:07:39,380
When I got the entry fee in my pocket.

45
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,340
Yeah.

46
00:07:42,384 --> 00:07:44,385
Are you from ranch people?

47
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:46,346
Yeah, I was.

48
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:50,392
Did your folks run you off?

49
00:07:50,392 --> 00:07:53,396
No, they run themselves off.

50
00:07:53,396 --> 00:07:57,400
There was, uh, one curve in the road in 43 miles...

51
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,403
and they missed it.

52
00:07:59,403 --> 00:08:01,405
So, uh...

53
00:08:01,405 --> 00:08:05,326
the bank took the ranch, and
my brother and sister, they raised me mostly.

54
00:08:08,413 --> 00:08:09,413
Shit!

55
00:08:09,413 --> 00:08:11,374
That’s hard.

56
00:08:16,422 --> 00:08:18,382
Can I?

57
00:08:42,451 --> 00:08:43,452
One thing...

58
00:08:43,452 --> 00:08:45,455
don’t ever order soup.

59
00:08:45,455 --> 00:08:47,457
Them soup boxes are hard to pack.

60
00:08:47,457 --> 00:08:51,378
I don’t eat soup.

61
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:56,467
Well, watch it there.

62
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:59,470
That horse has a low startle point.

63
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,474
Don’t think there’s a filly that can throw me.

64
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:06,395
When you get in this damn saddle it’s kinda not so bad.

65
00:11:49,663 --> 00:11:50,664
Shit.

66
00:11:50,664 --> 00:11:54,586
Can’t wait till I get my own spread
and won’t have to put up with Joe Aguirre’s crap no more.

67
00:11:56,671 --> 00:12:00,676
I’m savin’ for a place myself.

68
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:04,596
Alma and me, we’ll be getting married
when I come down off this mountain.

69
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:09,686
That stay with the sheep,
no fire bullshit,...

70
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:13,607
Aguirre got no right makin’ us do
something against the rules.

71
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:04,331
No more beans.

72
00:13:45,795 --> 00:13:48,798
Something wrong?

73
00:13:48,798 --> 00:13:49,799
Yeah.

74
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,801
Why didn’t we get the powdered milk and the spuds?

75
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:55,723
It’s all we got.

76
00:13:56,807 --> 00:14:00,811
Well here’s next week’s.

77
00:14:00,811 --> 00:14:02,814
I thought you didn’t eat soup.

78
00:14:02,814 --> 00:14:04,816
Yeah, well, I’m sick of beans.

79
00:14:04,816 --> 00:14:08,737
Too early in the summer to be sick of beans.

80
00:14:09,822 --> 00:14:11,782
Come on.

81
00:14:46,864 --> 00:14:48,824
Whoa there, whoa, whoa!

82
00:15:44,929 --> 00:15:46,932
Where the hell you been?

83
00:15:46,932 --> 00:15:50,853
I been up with the sheep all day,
I’m hungry as hell and all I find is beans.

84
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,944
What in the hell happened, Ennis?

85
00:15:57,944 --> 00:15:59,947
Come upon a bear, is what happened.

86
00:15:59,947 --> 00:16:01,948
Goddam horse spooked, and the mules took off

87
00:16:01,948 --> 00:16:04,952
and scattered food everywhere.

88
00:16:04,952 --> 00:16:06,913
Beans is about all we got left.

89
00:16:07,955 --> 00:16:10,625
Got whisky or something?

90
00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:16,215
Dumbass mule!

91
00:16:23,974 --> 00:16:25,975
God-damn!

92
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:27,936
Let me see.

93
00:16:33,985 --> 00:16:34,986
(Shit)

94
00:16:34,986 --> 00:16:38,990
Well, we gotta do something about
this food situation.

95
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,993
Maybe I’ll shoot one of the sheep.

96
00:16:40,993 --> 00:16:43,997
Yeah, what if Aguirre finds out, huh?

97
00:16:43,997 --> 00:16:45,998
Supposed to guard the sheep, not eat ’em.

98
00:16:45,998 --> 00:16:49,920
What’s the matter with you?
There are thousands of ’em.

99
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:52,965
Sick of beans.

100
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:56,970
Well, I won’t.

101
00:17:08,774 --> 00:17:10,443
Whoo-wee!  Yeah!

102
00:17:11,027 --> 00:17:14,031
Was getting’ tired of your dumbass missin’!

103
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:16,032
Then we won’t.

104
00:17:16,032 --> 00:17:19,954
Ain’t nothing you can do with fish
that can’t do with no elk!

105
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:55,828
Hey, I’m commutin’ four hours a day.

106
00:17:56,078 --> 00:17:57,788
I come in for breakfast.

107
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,456
I go back to the sheep.

108
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:01,667
Evening get ’em bedded down,

109
00:18:02,085 --> 00:18:04,087
come in for supper,
go back to the sheep.

110
00:18:05,088 --> 00:18:09,093
I spend half the night checking for damn coyotes.

111
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:13,014
Aguirre got no right making me do this.

112
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:18,103
If you wanna switch,
I wouldn’t mind sleepin’ out there.

113
00:18:18,103 --> 00:18:22,107
That ain’t the point.
Point is we both oughta be in this camp.

114
00:18:22,107 --> 00:18:26,112
Goddam pup tent smells like cat piss, or worse.

115
00:18:26,112 --> 00:18:30,033
I wouldn’t mind bein’ out there.

116
00:18:31,118 --> 00:18:34,121
Well, I’m happy to switch with you, but...

117
00:18:34,121 --> 00:18:37,125
I warn you, I can’t cook worth a damn.

118
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:41,129
I am pretty good with a can opener, though.

119
00:18:41,129 --> 00:18:45,050
Well you can’t be no worse than me, then.

120
00:18:56,146 --> 00:19:02,445
You don’t get much sleep, I tell you that.

121
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:01,402
Yeah.  Come on

122
00:19:19,172 --> 00:19:21,133
I saw a coyote up there.

123
00:19:23,176 --> 00:19:24,345
A big son of a bitch.

124
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:27,181
Balls on him the size of apples.

125
00:19:27,181 --> 00:19:31,186
Looked like he could eat himself a camel.

126
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:33,146
You want some of this hot water.

127
00:19:37,192 --> 00:19:39,153
It’s all yours.

128
00:20:18,238 --> 00:20:21,242
I don’t rodeo much myself.

129
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:25,246
What’s the point of riding
some piece of stock for 8 seconds?

130
00:20:25,246 --> 00:20:27,249
Money’s a good point.

131
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,252
Uh-huh.

132
00:20:29,252 --> 00:20:33,256
If you don’t get stomped winnin’ it.

133
00:20:33,256 --> 00:20:35,258
Yeah.

134
00:20:35,258 --> 00:20:37,260
Well, my old man,

135
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,221
he’s a bull rider.

136
00:20:40,264 --> 00:20:42,266
Thanks.

137
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:45,185
Pretty well-known in his day.

138
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:49,274
Though he kept his secrets to himself.

139
00:20:49,274 --> 00:20:53,195
Never taught me a thing,
never once come to see me ride.

140
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:01,120
There.

141
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,295
Your brother and sister do right by you?

142
00:21:07,295 --> 00:21:11,215
The did the best they could
after my folks was gone.

143
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,303
Considerin’ they didn’t leave us nothin’ but

144
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:19,308
$24 and a coffee can.

145
00:21:19,308 --> 00:21:22,311
They got me a year of high school.

146
00:21:22,311 --> 00:21:26,232
That was before the transmission went on the pick-up.

147
00:21:28,318 --> 00:21:32,239
Then my sis left,
met a rough-neck and moved to Casper.

148
00:21:33,324 --> 00:21:35,576
Me and my brother, we...

149
00:21:35,618 --> 00:21:38,162
we went and got ourselves some work
on a ranch up near Worland...

150
00:21:38,246 --> 00:21:40,331
... till I was 19.

151
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:44,336
Then he got married, and uh...

152
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:48,257
No more room for me.

153
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:51,303
That’s how come...

154
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:54,305
...you end up here.

155
00:22:03,358 --> 00:22:05,319
What?

156
00:22:06,361 --> 00:22:10,282
That’s more words than
you spoke in the past 2 weeks.

157
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:15,288
Hell, that’s the most I spoke in a year!

158
00:22:19,376 --> 00:22:22,671
My dad, he was a farm roper.
Didn’t rodeo much, though.

159
00:22:22,963 --> 00:22:26,426
He thought rodeo cowboys was all fuck-ups.

160
00:22:30,388 --> 00:22:33,392
The hell we are.

161
00:22:33,392 --> 00:22:35,352
Well...

162
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,361
- Yeehaw.
- There you go.

163
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,197
Burn his guts out.

164
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:48,409
Wavin’ to the girls in the stands!

165
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:50,411
He’s kickin’ me to high heaven!

166
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,251
I think my dad was right.

167
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,431
Tent don’t look right.

168
00:23:45,474 --> 00:23:46,474
It ain’t goin’ nowhere.

169
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:48,435
Let it be.

170
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:52,481
That harmonica don’t sound quite right either.

171
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:55,485
That’s ’cause it got kinda flat,
when my mare threw me.

172
00:23:55,485 --> 00:23:57,445
Oh yeah?

173
00:23:58,488 --> 00:24:01,491
I thought you said that mare couldn’t throw you.

174
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:03,494
Oh, she got lucky.

175
00:24:03,494 --> 00:24:07,415
Yeah well, if I’d to listen to that harmonica,
I woulda broke it, too.

176
00:24:11,502 --> 00:24:15,508
#I know I shall meet you
on that final day.#

177
00:24:15,508 --> 00:24:18,510
#Water-walkin’ Jesus.#

178
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:22,516
#Take me away!#

179
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,439
My mama, she believes in the Pentecost.

180
00:24:28,522 --> 00:24:30,483
Yeah?

181
00:24:32,527 --> 00:24:34,529
What exactly is the Pentecost?

182
00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:38,533
I mean, my folks they was Methodists.

183
00:24:38,533 --> 00:24:42,537
The Pentecost... I don’t know.
I don’t know what the Pentecost is.

184
00:24:42,537 --> 00:24:44,540
No-one ever explained it to me.

185
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,544
I guess, when the world ends,...

186
00:24:47,544 --> 00:24:51,548
fellows like you and me
we march off to Hell.

187
00:24:51,548 --> 00:24:53,551
Speak for yourself.

188
00:24:53,551 --> 00:24:57,471
You may be a sinner,
but I ain’t yet had the opportunity.

189
00:24:59,557 --> 00:25:01,518
Thank you.

190
00:25:06,565 --> 00:25:09,568
I’m gonna go up to the sheep now.

191
00:25:20,581 --> 00:25:24,502
Damn, it’s too late to go to them sheep.

192
00:25:27,589 --> 00:25:29,591
You got an extra blanket?

193
00:25:29,591 --> 00:25:31,426
I’ll just roll up out here.

194
00:25:31,844 --> 00:25:34,597
Catch forty winks.

195
00:25:34,597 --> 00:25:38,518
I’ll ride out first light.

196
00:25:40,603 --> 00:25:43,607
You’ll freeze your ass of
when that fire dies down.

197
00:25:43,607 --> 00:25:45,609
That’s good enough.

198
00:26:27,657 --> 00:26:29,200
Ennis!

199
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:30,660
What?

200
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,582
Quit your hammerin’ and get in here.

201
00:27:46,162 --> 00:27:52,003
What’re we doin’?

202
00:29:54,642 --> 00:29:57,853
See you for supper.

203
00:29:57,978 --> 00:30:00,023
Come on.

204
00:32:03,787 --> 00:32:07,709
This is a one-shot thing we got goin’ on here.

205
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:13,966
It’s nobody’s business but ours.

206
00:32:16,051 --> 00:32:17,720
You know I ain’t queer.

207
00:32:18,763 --> 00:32:20,348
Me neither.

208
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:48,975
Twist.

209
00:34:49,433 --> 00:34:52,479
Your Uncle Harold’s in the hospital
with pneumonia.

210
00:34:52,895 --> 00:34:55,189
Doctors don’t expect he’ll make it.

211
00:34:55,565 --> 00:34:59,487
Your ma sent me to tell you,
so... here I am.

212
00:35:02,073 --> 00:35:03,741
Bad news.

213
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,579
There ain’t nothing I can do about it up here, I guess.

214
00:35:08,413 --> 00:35:10,833
There’s not much you can do about it there, neither.

215
00:35:14,169 --> 00:35:17,507
Unless you can cure pneumonia.

216
00:35:51,504 --> 00:35:52,130
Jesus.

217
00:35:52,296 --> 00:35:55,300
Them sheep’ll drift if I don’t get back up there tonight.

218
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,304
You’ll get pissed in a storm like this.

219
00:35:59,304 --> 00:36:01,890
And we sure ain’t tryin’.

220
00:36:01,932 --> 00:36:03,392
Close it up.

221
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,489
Well, what are we supposed to do now, huh?

222
00:36:15,823 --> 00:36:20,245
Get on in there and untangle
them sheep out of ours, I guess.

223
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,040
...where is it..?

224
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:31,757
Maybe the Goddam sheep rachers were off.

225
00:36:32,174 --> 00:36:33,426
We’ve gotta try.
The least we can do is get...

226
00:36:33,468 --> 00:36:35,928
...the count right for Aguirre.

227
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,015
Fuck Aguirre.

228
00:36:38,348 --> 00:36:42,269
Oh yeah, fuck Aguirre.
What if we need work next year?
You ever figure about that?

229
00:36:42,394 --> 00:36:44,480
We gotta stick this out, Jack.

230
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,043
You’ll run them sheep off, if you don’t quiet down.

231
00:37:40,169 --> 00:37:41,420
What are you doin’?

232
00:37:43,421 --> 00:37:44,757
Aguirre came by again.

233
00:37:45,632 --> 00:37:47,259
Said my uncle didn’t die after all.

234
00:37:47,927 --> 00:37:50,179
Said to bring ’em down.

235
00:37:50,597 --> 00:37:52,056
Bring ’em down?  Why?
It’s the middle of August.

236
00:37:52,265 --> 00:37:54,143
Said there’s a storm comin’.

237
00:37:54,351 --> 00:37:58,355
Comin’ in from the Pacific.
Worse than this one.

238
00:37:59,774 --> 00:38:04,362
But that snow barely stuck an hour.

239
00:38:04,779 --> 00:38:08,450
That son-of-a-bitch, he’s cuttin’ us out
of a whole month’s pay.

240
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,410
It ain’t right.

241
00:38:13,456 --> 00:38:15,416
Well, I’d spare you a loan but
I’m short on cash.

242
00:38:16,459 --> 00:38:18,462
I can give it to you when we get to Signal.

243
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,213
I don’t need your money.

244
00:38:20,463 --> 00:38:22,800
I ain’t in the poorhouse.

245
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,760
Shit.

246
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:28,139
All right...

247
00:39:00,509 --> 00:39:02,470
Time to get goin’, cowboy.

248
00:39:17,528 --> 00:39:19,489
This ain’t no rodeo, cowboy.

249
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:49,064
Ennis... Ennis.

250
00:39:52,568 --> 00:39:54,529
Come here.

251
00:40:47,046 --> 00:40:50,800
Some of these never went up there with you.

252
00:40:52,636 --> 00:40:55,390
The count ain’t what I’d hoped for, neither.

253
00:40:56,015 --> 00:40:59,560
You ranch stiffs,
you ain’t ever no good.

254
00:41:13,826 --> 00:41:15,787
You wanna give it some gas?

255
00:41:25,256 --> 00:41:28,969
I can’t believe I left
my damn shirt up there.

256
00:41:34,267 --> 00:41:36,269
You gonna do this again next summer?

257
00:41:36,686 --> 00:41:40,607
Well, maybe not.  Like I said,
me and Alma’s gettin’ married in November.

258
00:41:43,694 --> 00:41:47,615
So... I’ll try to get something on a ranch, I guess.

259
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:49,617
You?

260
00:41:50,702 --> 00:41:54,623
Might go up to my daddy’s place.
Give him a hand during winter.

261
00:41:56,708 --> 00:42:00,630
I might be back.
If the army don’t get me.

262
00:42:06,887 --> 00:42:09,640
Well, I guess I’ll see you around, huh?

263
00:42:10,391 --> 00:42:11,726
Right.

264
00:43:21,972 --> 00:43:26,727
What the fuck are you lookin’ at?
Huh?

265
00:43:34,819 --> 00:43:38,824
...forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those who trespass against us,

266
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,785
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

267
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:46,750
For Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory,
for ever and ever.  Amen.

268
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:50,378
Under the powers vested in me, I now
pronounce you man and wife.

269
00:43:53,841 --> 00:43:55,801
You may kiss the bride.

270
00:43:56,219 --> 00:43:58,513
And if you don’t, I will.

271
00:44:13,863 --> 00:44:15,866
You all right?

272
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:24,709
Stop!
No, you stop!

273
00:44:30,883 --> 00:44:33,886
My old lady’s tryin’ to get me to quit this job.

274
00:44:33,886 --> 00:44:37,890
She says I get too old breaking my back
shovellin’ asphalt.

275
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:41,896
I told her, strong backs
and weak mind runs in the family!

276
00:44:44,899 --> 00:44:46,859
I told her it keeps me fit.

277
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:25,654
Yeah!

278
00:45:31,744 --> 00:45:33,871
Well look what the wind blew in.

279
00:45:34,455 --> 00:45:36,124
Hi Mr Aguirre.

280
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,127
Wonderin’ if you was needin’ any help this summer.

281
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:41,547
Wastin’ your time here.

282
00:45:42,589 --> 00:45:44,883
What, you ain’t got nothin’?

283
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:49,263
Nothin’ up on Brokeback.

284
00:45:50,306 --> 00:45:53,643
I ain’t got no work for you.

285
00:46:01,152 --> 00:46:05,073
Ennis del Mar ain’t been around, has he?

286
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:11,914
You boys sure found a way
to make the time pass up there.

287
00:46:12,998 --> 00:46:19,005
Twist, you guys wasn’t gettin’ paid to
leave the dogs to babysit the sheep
while you stemmed the rose.

288
00:46:25,345 --> 00:46:27,640
Now get the hell out of my trailer.

289
00:47:14,234 --> 00:47:16,653
How are you girls doin’?

290
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:20,992
All right.
Jenny’s still got a runny nose

291
00:47:42,683 --> 00:47:45,853
Ennis, could you wipe Alma junior’s nose?

292
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:53,029
If I had free hands I could!

293
00:47:50,109 --> 00:47:52,069
Shh, come here.

294
00:48:19,308 --> 00:48:22,353
- Girls all right?
- Yeah

295
00:48:23,396 --> 00:48:25,899
Jenny’s still got a cough.

296
00:48:26,525 --> 00:48:31,072
I think you should take the girls into town this
weekend and get ’em an ice-cream... or somethin’?

297
00:48:36,536 --> 00:48:39,248
Can’t we move to town?

298
00:48:40,332 --> 00:48:44,337
I’m tired of these lonesome old ranches.

299
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:46,338
No-one for Alma jr. to play with,...

300
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:48,425
...besides, I’m scared for Jenny,...

301
00:48:48,633 --> 00:48:52,095
...scared she has another one of
them bad asthma spells.

302
00:48:53,180 --> 00:49:00,104
No, rent in town’s too high.

303
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:01,981
There’s a cheap place in Riverton
over the laundromat.

304
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:04,276
I bet I could fix it up real nice.

305
00:49:04,693 --> 00:49:09,115
I bet you could fix this place up
real nice if you wanted to.

306
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,204
I know you’d like it, too.

307
00:49:15,204 --> 00:49:19,126
A real home,
lots of kids for the girls to play with.

308
00:49:21,379 --> 00:49:24,924
Not so lonely like you were raised.

309
00:49:26,218 --> 00:49:30,138
You don’t want it to be so lonely, do you?

310
00:49:43,403 --> 00:49:45,573
I ain’t so lonely now.

311
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:53,081
You sure the girls are asleep?

312
00:49:53,499 --> 00:49:54,750
Sure.

313
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:08,390
Come here.

314
00:50:24,283 --> 00:50:28,204
Let her rip..., boys
He’s hangin’ on for dear life

315
00:50:32,292 --> 00:50:36,213
Watch out there, he’s coming for ya!
Send in the clowns!

316
00:50:37,297 --> 00:50:40,301
Shit.

317
00:50:42,304 --> 00:50:46,224
Never mind folks,
there are the rodeo clowns!

318
00:51:03,494 --> 00:51:09,626
I’d like to buy Jimbo here a beer.

319
00:51:07,123 --> 00:51:10,461
Best damn rodeo hand I ever worked with.

320
00:51:13,339 --> 00:51:16,926
Thanks cowboy. If I was to let every
rodeo hand I pulled a bull off of

321
00:51:16,967 --> 00:51:19,638
buy me liquor I’d a been an alcohol long ago.

322
00:51:26,354 --> 00:51:30,358
Well, bullseye for you buccaroo, it’s just my job.

323
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:34,279
Save your money for your
next entry fee, cowboy.

324
00:51:48,336 --> 00:51:52,300
You ever try calf ropin’?

325
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:57,221
Do I look like I can afford a fuckin’ ropin’ horse?

326
00:52:15,367 --> 00:52:19,330
- Do you wanna go in a little closer?
- No, this is fine, Jenny’ll get scared.

327
00:52:25,378 --> 00:52:27,381
Woo-wee!  Look at this crowd!

328
00:52:27,381 --> 00:52:30,384
Bound to be a lot of pussy on the hunt
in a crowd like this!

329
00:52:30,384 --> 00:52:32,386
..scroll up.

330
00:52:32,386 --> 00:52:34,389
.... like a frog.

331
00:52:34,389 --> 00:52:37,392
Where’d you figure the most pussies at?

332
00:52:37,392 --> 00:52:39,394
- Las Vegas?
- California.

333
00:52:40,396 --> 00:52:43,398
...one town in Wyoming, I take Wyoming.

334
00:52:43,398 --> 00:52:45,777
Hey, you might wanna keep it down.
There are two little girls here.

335
00:52:46,027 --> 00:52:47,862
Fuck you.

336
00:53:06,425 --> 00:53:09,178
I don’t want any trouble, but you need
to shut yourself up.

337
00:53:09,595 --> 00:53:12,432
Listen to your old lady tonight.

338
00:53:15,435 --> 00:53:19,440
What about it?  You wanna lose
about half your fuckin’ teeth?

339
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,402
It’s all right, buddy.
I’d sure rather not.

340
00:53:31,036 --> 00:53:35,416
Here she comes, ladies and gentlemen!
Oh boy, look at her fly!

341
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:39,587
It’s Lureen Milton from right here in Childress, Texas.
Come on folks, she’s one of yours...

342
00:53:40,005 --> 00:53:41,464
Let’s give her a big hand.

343
00:53:41,674 --> 00:53:45,428
She’s cleared on two
She’s around three.

344
00:53:46,262 --> 00:53:47,513
Come on folks, help her home!

345
00:53:49,474 --> 00:53:51,476
Come on, come on!

346
00:53:52,226 --> 00:53:53,979
And the time is...

347
00:53:54,062 --> 00:53:55,647
...sixteen and a half.

348
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,501
Ma’am.

349
00:54:38,821 --> 00:54:45,078
Next up is a newcomer, Jack Twist,
all the way up from Lightning Flat, Wyoming.

350
00:55:05,518 --> 00:55:06,978
Let’s see what the judges say...

351
00:55:07,395 --> 00:55:09,898
I tell you what.
That sure looked like a winnin’ ride to me.

352
00:55:30,129 --> 00:55:31,798
You know that girl?

353
00:55:32,591 --> 00:55:36,553
I sure do.  That’s Lureen Newsome.
Dad sells farm equipment.  Big farm equipment.

354
00:55:37,596 --> 00:55:41,559
$100,000 tractors,
shit like that.

355
00:55:54,823 --> 00:55:58,286
What you waitin’ for cowboy?  A mating call?

356
00:57:34,728 --> 00:57:36,731
Wait, hold on.

357
00:57:36,731 --> 00:57:39,734
You don’t think I’m too fast, do you?

358
00:57:39,734 --> 00:57:42,738
Maybe we should put the brakes on?

359
00:57:42,738 --> 00:57:46,700
Fast or slow, I just like
the direction you’re goin’.

360
00:57:56,754 --> 00:57:58,755
You are in a hurry!

361
00:57:58,755 --> 00:58:02,719
My daddy’s in a hurry.
Wants me home with the car by midnight.

362
00:58:15,775 --> 00:58:17,777
- Hey, Monroe.
- Hey, En.

363
00:58:17,777 --> 00:58:18,778
Is Alma here?

364
00:58:18,778 --> 00:58:19,946
She’s in the condiments aisle.

365
00:58:19,988 --> 00:58:21,157
The what?

366
00:58:21,157 --> 00:58:23,659
- Ketchup.
- Thanks.

367
00:58:27,205 --> 00:58:30,792
Hey honey!  What are y’all doin’ here?

368
00:58:30,792 --> 00:58:32,419
I’m in a big hurry.

369
00:58:32,461 --> 00:58:35,381
My boss called and, uh,
he wants me to go up the ranch.

370
00:58:35,797 --> 00:58:38,801
Seems all the heifers decided to calf at the same time.

371
00:58:38,801 --> 00:58:40,804
I figured I could drop the girls off with you.

372
00:58:40,804 --> 00:58:44,766
I got a million things I gotta do
before I leave.

373
00:58:45,767 --> 00:58:47,478
I don’t get off for another three hours.

374
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:49,521
Mama, I need to pee.
Not now, honey.

375
00:58:49,813 --> 00:58:52,817
Ennis, please, you promised
you’d take them tonight.

376
00:58:52,817 --> 00:58:55,820
I can’t afford not to be there
when they have these calfs.

377
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:57,823
I’ll lose my job if they lose any of ’em.

378
00:58:57,823 --> 00:59:00,367
And what about my job?

379
00:59:02,828 --> 00:59:05,832
OK, all right.
Call my sister see if she can take ’em.

380
00:59:05,832 --> 00:59:07,834
All right, all right.

381
00:59:07,834 --> 00:59:10,838
Be a good girl for mama, all right?

382
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:14,800
I’ll be half the night...

383
00:59:19,555 --> 00:59:20,848
Oh boy!

384
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:23,852
Monroe, I am so sorry!

385
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:25,854
It’s ok, it’s ok.

386
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:29,859
I’ll clean this up, just as soon as
I call my sister to come get the girls.

387
00:59:29,859 --> 00:59:30,860
Really, Alma, it’s ok.

388
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,862
- Forget it.
- Alma, come with me.

389
00:59:32,862 --> 00:59:33,863
Watch your feet.

390
00:59:34,573 --> 00:59:36,032
Alma.

391
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:48,881
I got two whole boxes of formula for you.

392
00:59:48,881 --> 00:59:51,883
- 120 cans
- 120?

393
00:59:51,883 --> 00:59:53,886
Dear, where’d you put ’em?

394
00:59:53,886 --> 00:59:55,638
Oh hell.  Back seat of the car where I left ’em.

395
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:00,018
Rodeo can get ’em.

396
01:00:04,898 --> 01:00:06,901
I can already see what little Bobby looks like.

397
01:00:06,901 --> 01:00:10,863
Good job, little girl.
He’s the spittin’ image of his grandpa.

398
01:00:11,906 --> 01:00:15,870
Isn’t he just the spitting image of his grandpa?

399
01:00:48,614 --> 01:00:50,075
Hey.

400
01:00:57,959 --> 01:01:01,545
Hey Ennis?  You somebody, name of Jack?

401
01:01:04,216 --> 01:01:05,217
Maybe.  Why?

402
01:01:05,968 --> 01:01:09,097
’Cause you got a postcard that
come general delivery.

403
01:01:12,183 --> 01:01:18,064
Friend, this letter is long over due.  Coming through
on the 24th.  Drop me a line say if your there.  Jack.

404
01:01:19,983 --> 01:01:23,947
Is it somebody you cowboyed with, or what?

405
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:26,991
No, Jack he rodeos, mostly.

406
01:01:29,494 --> 01:01:32,956
We was fishin’ buddies.
